## antlr-rust-runtime

> Validates the Rust runtime against ANTLR's upstream conformance descriptors.

# Development notes

## Codegen boundaries

Generic runtime and codegen paths must stay grammar-agnostic. Do not add
language-specific rule names, grammar names, file extensions, or semantic
workarounds to `src/bin/antlr4-rust-gen.rs` or runtime modules; model the
behavior from ANTLR metadata/ATN structure instead, and keep language-specific
guidance in docs or tests for that language.

## Kotlin parser parity perf benchmark

Reproduces the timings against the Kotlin grammar from `antlr/grammars-v4`.

### One-time setup (fresh checkout)

```bash
# 1. ANTLR jar (any path; pin v4.13.2)
mkdir -p /tmp/antlr-cleanroom/tools
curl -fLo /tmp/antlr-cleanroom/tools/antlr-4.13.2-complete.jar \
    https://www.antlr.org/download/antlr-4.13.2-complete.jar

# 2. grammars-v4 checkout (sparse, just the kotlin grammar)
mkdir -p /tmp/antlr-cleanroom/grammars-v4
git -C /tmp/antlr-cleanroom/grammars-v4 init -q
git -C /tmp/antlr-cleanroom/grammars-v4 remote add origin https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4.git
git -C /tmp/antlr-cleanroom/grammars-v4 sparse-checkout init --cone
git -C /tmp/antlr-cleanroom/grammars-v4 sparse-checkout set kotlin/kotlin
git -C /tmp/antlr-cleanroom/grammars-v4 fetch --depth 1 origin 284602b3f23ca54dc30778204ab7ae9e969145e9
git -C /tmp/antlr-cleanroom/grammars-v4 checkout FETCH_HEAD
```

### Run the parity smoke + dumper build

```bash
tests/kotlin-parity/run.sh \
    --antlr-jar /tmp/antlr-cleanroom/tools/antlr-4.13.2-complete.jar \
    --grammars-v4 /tmp/antlr-cleanroom/grammars-v4
```

That generates the Rust recognizers directly from the Kotlin `.g4` source,
builds `tests/kotlin-parity/dumper`, and asserts the parse trees match
`antlr4-python3-runtime` byte-for-byte. The ANTLR jar is used only for the
Python oracle.

### Measure parse-only timings

The dumper has a built-in parse-only stopwatch so process startup (~10 ms) is excluded:

```bash
DUMPER=tests/kotlin-parity/dumper/target/release/kotlin-parity-dumper
for snippet in tests/kotlin-parity/snippets/*.kt; do
    echo "=== $(basename "$snippet") ==="
    "$DUMPER" --input "$snippet" --output /tmp/dump.txt --iters 5 --time
done
```

`--iters N` repeats parse N times within one process; `--time` prints `min`/`avg` to stderr.

## ANTLR runtime testsuite

Validates the Rust runtime against ANTLR's upstream conformance descriptors.

### One-time setup

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/antlr/antlr4 /tmp/antlr-cleanroom/antlr4-upstream
```

The harness reads `antlr4-upstream/runtime-testsuite` and the same ANTLR jar fetched above.

### Run the full sweep

```bash
cargo run --release --quiet --bin antlr4-runtime-testsuite
```

Defaults to `ANTLR4_JAR=/tmp/antlr-cleanroom/tools/antlr-4.13.2-complete.jar` and `ANTLR4_RUNTIME_TESTSUITE=/tmp/antlr-cleanroom/antlr4-upstream/runtime-testsuite`. Override with `--antlr-jar`/`--descriptors` or env vars. Cases run on `--jobs` parallel workers (default `min(cores, 8)`), each with its own cargo target-dir stripe; the render driver and `antlr4-rust-gen` are prebuilt once per sweep. Wall-clock ≈ 2 minutes on Apple Silicon.

### The rendered (embedded-actions) pipeline

The harness runs descriptors the way every official ANTLR target does:
each descriptor grammar is rendered through
`.conformance-review/Rust.test.stg` with the real StringTemplate engine
(`tools/stg-render/RenderGrammar.java`, executed via the ANTLR jar and the
Java single-file source launcher), so its actions/predicates become real
Rust code. The rendered grammar feeds `antlr4-rust-gen --actions embedded`
directly, which splices the bodies verbatim
after `$`-attribute translation (`src/bin_support/embedded.rs`) and
generates typed context views, per-rule attrs structs, members
fields/methods, listener traits, and recognizer facades. `--stg PATH`
overrides the template group. (An earlier template-recognition pipeline,
which simulated action output instead of executing it, was replaced by
this one before ever shipping.)

### Run a subset while iterating

```bash
# One descriptor:
cargo run --release --quiet --bin antlr4-runtime-testsuite -- --case LexerExec/KeywordID

# One group (e.g. while debugging left-recursion):
cargo run --release --quiet --bin antlr4-runtime-testsuite -- --group LeftRecursion --limit 20

# Keep the per-case temp crates for inspection:
cargo run --release --quiet --bin antlr4-runtime-testsuite -- --case ParserErrors/SingleSetInsertion --keep
```

Per-case scratch crates land under `target/antlr-runtime-testsuite/<case>/`. Stale dirs from a killed run can fail a re-run with `Os { code: 66, ... DirectoryNotEmpty }` — `rm -rf target/antlr-runtime-testsuite/*` to recover.

## Code coverage

CI collects LLVM source-based coverage (`cargo-llvm-cov`) and uploads it to
Codecov as two merged flags — `unittests` (from `ci.yml`) and `conformance`
(from `antlr-runtime-testsuite.yml`). One-time local install (it is a crates.io
cargo subcommand, *not* a rustup component, so it cannot live in
`rust-toolchain.toml` — only its `llvm-tools` dependency does, and that is
already pinned there):

```bash
cargo install cargo-llvm-cov   # or: cargo binstall cargo-llvm-cov (prebuilt)
```

Then reproduce CI locally:

```bash
cargo llvm-cov --all-features --workspace --lcov --output-path lcov.info   # unit + integration
cargo llvm-cov --all-features --workspace --html                          # browsable report
cargo llvm-cov --all-features --workspace                                  # terminal summary
```

**Coverage is line/region only.** Branch coverage is a nightly-only
instrumentation mode (`-Z coverage-options=branch`; `cargo llvm-cov --branch`
is `(unstable)`), and this crate pins stable — so line/region is the ceiling.
Codecov's primary metric is line coverage, so nothing is lost in practice.

The conformance sweep needs the subprocess-aware recipe, because it spawns
per-case smoke crates as `cargo run` with their own `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` stripes:

```bash
source <(cargo llvm-cov show-env --sh)   # exports RUSTC_WRAPPER + %p-keyed LLVM_PROFILE_FILE
cargo llvm-cov clean --workspace
cargo build --bin antlr4-runtime-testsuite --features codegen
cargo run   --bin antlr4-runtime-testsuite --features codegen
# `report` sees only the harness + generator (its object list comes from cargo
# build metadata, not a target/ scan), so fold the subprocess-built smoke
# binaries in by hand: capture report's own `llvm-cov export` and append them.
cargo llvm-cov report --lcov --output-path conformance.lcov
```

The `%p` (PID) in the profile-file pattern keeps parallel `--jobs` workers from
clobbering each other's `.profraw`, and the smoke subprocesses inherit the
instrumentation env (the harness only *adds* `CARGO_TARGET_DIR`), so every
`.profraw` lands in the main `target/`. But `cargo llvm-cov report` builds its
`-object` list from cargo's build metadata (the harness + `antlr4-rust-gen`),
**not** a filesystem scan — so the nested `cargo-target-*/` smoke binaries are
invisible to it and their profile counts get dropped. The CI job therefore
re-runs report's captured `llvm-cov export` with each stripe binary appended
(see `antlr-runtime-testsuite.yml`). In practice this is a small delta (~0.3%):
most conformance coverage comes from `antlr4-rust-gen`, which parses every
descriptor `.g4` through the runtime's own embedded ANTLR-v4 recognizer and so
already exercises `BaseParser`, the compiled lexer DFA, and prediction; the
smoke crates only add the sliver of compiled-recognizer paths not hit that way.

## Snapshot tests (insta)

Prefer `insta` snapshots over hand-written assertions whenever a test pins a
*value* rather than a *property*: multi-field struct/enum equality, the contents
of a collection, a formatted diagnostic or error message, generated-code
strings, and token/tree/ATN/DFA dumps. The "assert `.len()` then spot-check a few
fields" pattern is the clearest win — snapshot the whole structure and the count
is implied. Snapshots are more observable regression targets and subsume negative
`!contains(...)` guards by showing the full output. Keep explicit `assert!` for
genuine properties a snapshot would weaken — boolean predicates
(`assert!(x.is_empty())`), bounds (`dur < LIMIT`), round-trip/algebraic
invariants (`decode(encode(x)) == x`), ordering checks — and layer a snapshot
alongside them when both the value and the invariant matter.

House style is named external snapshots stored under a sibling `snapshots/` dir —
`insta::assert_debug_snapshot!("descriptive_snake_name", value)`, or
`assert_snapshot!(...)` for a `String`/`Display` value; use inline (`@"..."`)
only for small, stable values. Project specifics:

- **Every test module (or bare `#[test]` fn) that calls an insta macro needs
  `#[allow(clippy::disallowed_methods)] // insta assertion macros unwrap internal I/O.`**
  — `.clippy.toml` bans `.unwrap()` and the macros unwrap internally, so CI
  clippy fails without it (see `src/bin_support/grammar/semantics.rs`).
- **insta is `default-features = false`**: only `assert_snapshot!`,
  `assert_debug_snapshot!`, and `assert_compact_debug_snapshot!` are available.
  The YAML/JSON/redaction macros need serde, which the runtime does not use.
- **Determinism**: never snapshot `HashMap`/`HashSet` iteration order — the
  runtime's `PredictionFxHasher` maps (`prediction.rs`, `dfa.rs`) are unordered;
  collect into a `Vec` and sort by a stable key first. `BTreeMap`/`BTreeSet`
  (used throughout the generator) are already ordered and safe. `TokenView`'s
  `Debug` omits `byte_span`, so snapshot the explicit tuple when that field is
  the point of the test.
- **Workflow**: `cargo insta test` records pending `.snap.new`/`.pending-snap`;
  review each, then `cargo insta accept` (do not pass `--all-features` — it is
  rejected). `cargo-insta` 1.48+ is available.

## CI parity

CI runs `cargo clippy --locked --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`, so reproduce locally with the same flags before pushing — `clippy::excessive-nesting`, `clippy::disallowed_types`, and similar nursery/pedantic lints all promote to errors there.

Validate `.github/workflows/*.yml` with `actionlint` (not a generic YAML linter);
it shellchecks `run:` scripts too.

Run `cargo fmt` on files you touched before committing so formatting-only churn
doesn't ride along with logic changes (and never bulk-`cargo fmt` unrelated files
in a logic commit). Hand-grouped data — e.g. the positional serialized-ATN
fixtures in `src/atn/lexer_dfa.rs`, laid out one record-per-line to mirror the
ANTLR layout — carries `#[rustfmt::skip]`; leave those attributes in place rather
than letting fmt explode the block to one element per line.

## What "create a PR" means here

1. **Branch from `origin/main`** (or rebase onto it) — fetch first; `main` moves.
   The exception is explicitly stacked work, which branches from its parent PR.
2. **Use `gh` (already authenticated)**, and write the PR body to a file
   (`gh pr create --body-file`) rather than inlining it — heredocs and `--body`
   turn backticks and `$` into a shell-escaping fight. There is no PR template.
3. **Never open a draft** — the AI reviewers below only engage on ready PRs, so a
   draft just stalls the loop.
4. **Keep the description current.** Rewrite it (`gh pr edit --body-file`) when
   scope grows or the implementation diverges from what you first described; a
   stale description misleads every reviewer that reads it.

Merges are **squash-only** (merge commits are disabled) and the squash body is
built from `COMMIT_MESSAGES`, so it is the *commit message* — not the PR
description — that becomes permanent history. Write the commit message as the
durable explanation (what changed and why, with the non-obvious reasoning); the
PR description can carry review scaffolding like test tables and reviewer notes.

### The three AI reviewers

All three run on every PR with different mechanics, so "one of them is happy" is
not the finish line:

- **CodeRabbit** — starts as soon as the PR opens; posts inline comments that
  auto-resolve when you reply in the thread. It also posts **"outside diff
  range" comments — treat those as gold** and never skip them: they catch what a
  diff-local reviewer structurally cannot. Address or explicitly rebut each one.
- **Codex** (ChatGPT-powered) — 2–3 deep insights **after every push**, so it is
  iterative. It reacts 👀 when a review starts and **+1 when it approves**. If no
  reaction appears, trigger it with a top-level `@codex review` comment — but if
  👀 is already there it is mid-review, so wait rather than re-triggering.
- **Claude Code Review** — the deep pass: it has the ANTLR upstream source
  checked out and can build Java oracles and do comparable heavy research. It
  starts only **after CI (clippy + unit tests) succeeds** and can take 10–20
  minutes, then posts one large review comment. It does not set a PR status or
  reaction, so **workflow success is not approval** — read the comment: it states
  whether there are merge blockers or only minor items (do those too).

After opening a PR, **loop**: address every reviewer's comments and push, until
**both** Codex has reacted +1 **and** Claude Code Review's latest comment reports
no blockers. Reply to inline comments in their own thread; reply to Claude Code
Review as a top-level comment.

`CLAUDE.md` mirrors this file for Claude Code — keep them in sync when adding
sections.
