## Architecture

### Core Components

- **`src/mcp_pdf_tools/server.py`**: Main server implementation with all PDF processing tools
- **FastMCP Framework**: Uses FastMCP for MCP protocol implementation
- **Multi-library approach**: Integrates PyMuPDF, pdfplumber, pypdf, Camelot, Tabula, and Tesseract

### Tool Categories

1. **Text Extraction**: `extract_text` - Writes extracted text to a .txt file by default, returns path + preview. Set `inline=True` for full text in response.
2. **Table Extraction**: `extract_tables` - Auto-fallback through Camelot → pdfplumber → Tabula
3. **OCR Processing**: `ocr_pdf` - Tesseract with preprocessing options
4. **Document Analysis**: `is_scanned_pdf`, `get_document_structure`, `extract_metadata`
5. **Format Conversion**: `pdf_to_markdown` - Writes markdown + extracted raster images and vector graphics (SVG) to disk by default, returns path + preview. Images use relative `./images/` paths, vectors use `./vectors/` paths. Set `inline=True` for full markdown in response. Set `include_vectors=False` to skip vector extraction. Use `output_filename` to override the default .md filename. When `include_vectors=True`, returns `vector_diagnostics` showing which pages had drawings below the complexity threshold. Set `vector_fallback_raster=True` to render those sub-threshold pages as full-page raster images (PNG at 150 DPI) instead of skipping them. `markdown_to_pdf` - Reverse direction: converts a `.md` file or inline markdown text to PDF using pandoc. Auto-detects available PDF engines (xelatex, pdflatex, tectonic, weasyprint, wkhtmltopdf) and picks the best one on PATH. Pass `pdf_engine` to override or `extra_args` for raw pandoc options. Requires `pip install mcp-pdf[markdown]` and the pandoc binary.
6. **Image Processing**: `extract_images` - Extract images with custom output paths and clean summary output
7. **Link Extraction**: `extract_links` - Extract all hyperlinks with page filtering and type categorization
8. **PDF Forms**: `extract_form_data`, `create_form_pdf`, `fill_form_pdf`, `add_form_fields` - Complete form lifecycle management. **`extract_form_data` aligned to a six-term portable vocabulary** (text/checkbox/radio/dropdown/date/signature, plus button/unknown) so callers see the same field-type strings whether the form is AcroForm or XFA. **XFA detection wired in**: dynamic XFA forms now return a diagnostic error with `hint: "extract_xfa_fields"` instead of cryptic "document closed".
9. **XFA Forms (Dynamic Adobe LiveCycle)**: `is_xfa_pdf`, `extract_xfa_fields` - Schema extraction for dynamic XFA forms that no open-source library can render. `is_xfa_pdf` returns `{is_xfa, xfa_type: "dynamic"|"static"|None}` for branching before tool calls. `extract_xfa_fields` parses the XFA template XML for field names, captions, UI types — defaults to the **zipForm producer profile** (Lone Wolf / zipForm Plus conventions used by real-estate forms), with `profile="generic"` + `extra_plumbing_patterns`/`extra_positional_patterns` for other producers. Response splits fields into `shared` (cross-form `Global_Info-*` canonical vocabulary), `positional` (opaque codes like `p01tf022`), and `plumbing_fields_dropped` (producer internals). Every field carries `original` as the round-trip key; `canonical_name` appears only on shared fields. `canonical_separator` parameter selects `_`/`./`-` for the canonical names. `include_design_time_bbox=True` adds best-effort geometry (not authoritative for dynamic XFA — reflows at render time).
9. **Document Assembly**: `merge_pdfs`, `split_pdf_by_pages`, `reorder_pdf_pages` - PDF manipulation and organization
10. **Annotations & Markup**: `add_sticky_notes`, `add_highlights`, `add_stamps`, `add_video_notes`, `extract_all_annotations` - Collaboration and multimedia review tools
11. **Structure Detection**: `detect_structure`, `split_pdf_by_structure`, `batch_extract` - Chapter-aware document analysis and extraction. `detect_structure` finds headings via bookmarks, font-size heuristics, and numbering patterns. Writes full structure to a JSON file by default, returns compact summary + path (~1k tokens vs ~20k inline). Set `inline=True` for full data in response. `split_pdf_by_structure` auto-splits into per-chapter directories with markdown + images. `batch_extract` processes user-specified page ranges in a single call (replaces 24+ individual tool calls).

### MCP Client-Friendly Design

**Optimized for MCP Context Management:**
- **Custom Output Paths**: `extract_images` allows users to specify where images are saved
- **Clean Summary Output**: Returns concise extraction summary instead of verbose image metadata
- **File-First Output**: `extract_text` and `pdf_to_markdown` write results to files by default, returning paths + short previews instead of full content — prevents MCP context overflow on large PDFs
- **Disk-Based Images**: `pdf_to_markdown` extracts raster images to `{output_directory}/images/` with relative `./images/` paths — compatible with Starlight, browsers, and standard renderers
- **Vector Graphics**: `pdf_to_markdown` auto-detects significant vector content (charts, schematics, diagrams) and extracts full-page SVGs to `{output_directory}/vectors/` with relative `./vectors/` paths. Controlled by `include_vectors` parameter (default: True)
- **Inline Escape Hatch**: Both tools accept `inline=True` to return full content in the response for small queries
- **User Control**: Flexible output directory support with automatic directory creation

### Intelligent Fallbacks and Token Management

The server implements smart fallback mechanisms:
- Text extraction automatically detects scanned PDFs and suggests OCR
- Table extraction tries multiple methods until tables are found
- All operations include comprehensive error handling with helpful hints

**Smart Chunking for Large PDFs:**
- Automatic token estimation and overflow prevention
- Page-boundary chunking (default 10 pages per chunk)  
- Intelligent truncation at sentence boundaries when needed
- Clear guidance for accessing subsequent chunks
- Prevents MCP "response too large" errors commonly reported by users

### Dependencies Management

Critical system dependencies:
- **Tesseract OCR**: Required for `ocr_pdf` functionality
- **Java**: Required for Tabula table extraction
- **Ghostscript**: Required for Camelot table extraction
- **Poppler**: Required for PDF to image conversion

### Configuration

Environment variables (optional):
- `TESSDATA_PREFIX`: Tesseract language data location
- `PDF_TEMP_DIR`: Temporary file processing directory (defaults to `/tmp/mcp-pdf-processing`)
- `MCP_PDF_MAX_SIZE`: Maximum PDF file size in MB (e.g., `500` for 500MB). Set to `0` or leave empty to disable the limit (default: disabled)
- `MCP_PDF_ALLOWED_PATHS`: Colon-separated list of allowed output directories (e.g., `/tmp:/home/user/documents:/var/output`)
  - If unset: Allows writes to any directory with security warnings
  - If set: Restricts file outputs to specified directories only
  - **SECURITY NOTE**: This is "security theater" - real protection requires OS-level permissions and process isolation
- `DEBUG`: Enable debug logging

### Security Features

**🔒 "TRUST NO ONE" Security Philosophy**

This server implements defense-in-depth, but remember: **application-level security is "theater" - real security comes from the operating system and deployment practices.**

**Application-Level Protections (Security Theater):**

**Input Validation:**
- File size limits: 50MB for images. PDF size limit controlled by `MCP_PDF_MAX_SIZE` env var (in MB); disabled by default
- Page count limits: Max 1000 pages per document
- Path traversal protection for all file operations
- JSON input size limits (10KB) to prevent DoS attacks
- Safe parsing of user inputs with `ast.literal_eval` size limits

**Access Control:**
- Secure output directory validation (restricted to `/tmp`, `/var/tmp`, cache directory)
- URL allowlisting for download operations (configurable via `ALLOWED_DOMAINS`)
- File permission enforcement (0o700 for cache directories, 0o600 for cached files)

**Error Handling:**
- Sanitized error messages to prevent information disclosure
- Removal of sensitive data patterns (file paths, emails, SSNs)
- Generic error responses for failed operations

**Resource Management:**
- Streaming downloads with size checking to prevent memory exhaustion
- Page count validation to prevent resource exhaustion attacks
- Secure temporary file handling with automatic cleanup

**Vulnerability Scanning:**
- Integrated `safety` and `pip-audit` tools for dependency scanning
- GitHub Actions workflow for continuous security monitoring
- Daily automated vulnerability assessments

**⚡ REAL Security (What Actually Matters):**

1. **Process Isolation**: Run as non-privileged user with minimal permissions
2. **OS-Level Controls**: Use chroot/containers/systemd to limit filesystem access
3. **Network Isolation**: Firewall rules, network namespaces, air-gapped environments
4. **Resource Limits**: ulimit, cgroups, memory/CPU quotas at the OS level
5. **File Permissions**: Proper Unix permissions (chmod/chown) on directories and files
6. **Monitoring**: System-level audit logs, not application logs
7. **Regular Updates**: Keep OS, libraries, and dependencies patched

**Remember**: If an attacker has code execution, application-level restrictions are meaningless. Defense-in-depth starts with the operating system.
