## Project Overview

This is a **terminal-based kanban/project management tool** written in **Rust**, inspired by lazygit's interface design. It follows **SOLID principles** with a clean, modular architecture using Cargo workspaces.

**Tech Stack**:
- Language: Rust (2021 edition)
- TUI Framework: ratatui + crossterm
- Async Runtime: Tokio
- Development Environment: Nix

## Architecture Philosophy

### SOLID Principles Applied

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each crate has one clear purpose
2. **Open/Closed**: Domain models are extensible through traits
3. **Liskov Substitution**: Repository and Service traits enable polymorphism
4. **Interface Segregation**: Minimal, focused trait definitions
5. **Dependency Inversion**: All layers depend on abstractions (traits)

## Crate Descriptions

### kanban-core
**Purpose**: Foundation crate with shared abstractions

- `KanbanError` - Centralized error types
- `KanbanResult<T>` - Standard result type
- `Repository<T, Id>` - Generic repository trait
- `Service<T, Id>` - Generic service trait

**Design Pattern**: Error handling with thiserror, async traits

### kanban-domain
**Purpose**: Pure domain models with business logic

**Models**:
- `Board` - Top-level kanban board
- `Column` - Board columns with WIP limits
- `Card` - Task cards with priority, status, due dates
- `Tag` - Categorization tags

**Design Pattern**: Rich domain models with behavior, no infrastructure dependencies

### kanban-persistence
**Purpose**: Persistence trait layer — defines `PersistenceStore`, `StoreFactory`, `StoreRegistry`, and shared types (errors, snapshots, conflict detection, file watching)

- `PersistenceStore` - Async trait for load/save operations
- `StoreFactory` - Trait for backend registration (`name`, `supported_patterns`, `matches`, `create`)
- `StoreRegistry` - Registry that matches a locator string to the right factory
- `StoreSnapshot`, `PersistenceMetadata` - Shared serialization types
- `ConflictResolver`, `FormatVersion`, `MigrationStrategy` - Shared abstractions

**Design Pattern**: Trait-based abstraction layer; backends register via `StoreFactory`

### kanban-persistence-json
**Purpose**: JSON file storage backend implementing `StoreFactory`

- `JsonFileStore` - `PersistenceStore` impl with atomic writes (temp file + rename)
- `JsonStoreFactory` - `matches_content` sniffs the first non-whitespace byte (`{` or `[`); no extension matching
- Also hosts the `KanbanBackend` adapter over that store: `JsonDataStore` (in `json_backend.rs`, `impl KanbanBackend`/`LocalPersistence`, wrapping the format store with an `InMemoryStore` command-log mirror) and `JsonBackendFactory` (in `backend_factory.rs`, `impl KanbanBackendFactory`). This is why the crate depends on `kanban-backend` and `kanban-backend-memory`.
- Envelope: `{ version, metadata, data }`, current version V11; reader accepts V1..V11
- Migration chain V1 → V2 → V3 → (V4/V5 are shape-stable bumps) → V6 (split-graph) → V7 (spawns-bucket rename) → V8 (archived-card board_id backfill) → V9 (archived-board-capable marker) → V10 (archival wrapper collapsed to a pure reference marker) → V11 (historical `cards.board_id` backfill); legacy steps write `.v{N}.backup` on the way forward, including `.v10.backup` on the V10→V11 step
- Debounced saving (500ms minimum interval)

### kanban-persistence-sqlite
**Purpose**: SQLite storage backend implementing `StoreFactory`

- `SqliteStore` - `PersistenceStore` impl with WAL mode, foreign keys, max 2 connections
- `SqliteStoreFactory` - `matches_content` sniffs the SQLite magic bytes (`SQLite format 3\0`); no extension matching
- Also hosts the `KanbanBackend` adapter over that store: `SqliteBackend` (in `sqlite_backend.rs`, `impl KanbanBackend`/`LocalPersistence`) and `SqliteBackendFactory` (in `backend_factory.rs`, `impl KanbanBackendFactory`). This is why the crate depends on `kanban-backend` and `kanban-backend-memory`.
- Relational schema, 14 tables: metadata, boards, board_sprint_names, board_sprint_counters, columns, sprints, cards, sprint_logs, archived_cards, spawns_edges, blocks_edges, relates_edges, board_archival, command_log
- `SUPPORTED_SCHEMA_VERSION = 5` (active migrations upgrade older databases on open, each guarded by a durable `VACUUM INTO` pre-migration `.v{N}.backup`); legacy-table drops on open for pre-KAN-405 `command_log`, the retired `undo_state`, and the pre-KAN-504 single `card_edges` table
- Auto-creates database file on first use

### kanban-tui
**Purpose**: Terminal UI implementation

- `app` - Application state and main loop
- `ui` - Rendering components (ratatui widgets)
- `events` - Keyboard/terminal event handling

**Design Pattern**: Event-driven architecture, component-based rendering

### kanban-cli
**Purpose**: CLI entry point and command parsing

- Uses clap for command-line argument parsing
- Initializes tracing/logging
- Coordinates TUI launch

## Code Style Guidelines

### Rust Best Practices
- Use `impl Trait` for return types when appropriate
- Prefer `&str` over `String` for function parameters
- Use `Result<T, E>` for recoverable errors, `panic!` only for unrecoverable
- Leverage type system for compile-time guarantees
- Keep functions small and focused (< 50 lines)

### Error Handling
- All public APIs return `KanbanResult<T>`
- Use `thiserror` for error definitions
- Provide context with error messages
- Use `anyhow` only in application layer (kanban-cli)

### Async Patterns
- Use `async-trait` for async trait methods
- Tokio runtime for async execution

### Testing

**TDD workflow (mandatory — Red → Green → Refactor):**

1. **Red**: Write a failing test that specifies the expected behavior. Present tests to the user for review before implementing anything.
2. **Green**: Write the minimum implementation needed to make the test pass. Do not over-engineer at this step.
3. **Refactor**: Clean up implementation and tests without breaking anything. This step is not optional.
4. No feature or fix is complete until all tests pass and the refactor step is done.

**Test naming:** Names are living documentation. Use the pattern `test_<scenario>_<expected_outcome>`, e.g. `test_move_card_to_full_column_returns_wip_limit_error`. Avoid generic names like `test1` or `it_works`.

**Test return types:** Prefer `-> KanbanResult<()>` over `#[should_panic]`. This gives better failure messages and composes with `?`. Use `#[should_panic]` only for unrecoverable invariant violations.

**Test requirements by layer:**

| Layer | Test Type | Pattern |
|---|---|---|
| `kanban-core`, `kanban-domain` | Inline unit tests (`#[cfg(test)]`) | Pure logic, no I/O, no mocks needed |
| `kanban-persistence` | Inline unit tests | Trait contracts, registry logic |
| `kanban-persistence-json` | Inline unit tests + real tempfile I/O | Serialization, migration, round-trips |
| `kanban-persistence-sqlite` | Inline unit tests + real tempfile I/O | Schema, round-trips, concurrent access |
| `kanban-service` | Integration tests in `tests/` | `#[tokio::test]`, `KanbanContext` with real persistence via `TempDir` |
| `kanban-tui` | Integration tests in `tests/` | Component instantiation, key event simulation, export/import flows |
| `kanban-cli` | Integration tests in `tests/` | `assert_cmd` + real binary invocation via `cargo_bin_cmd!` |
| `kanban-mcp` | Integration tests in `tests/` | End-to-end tool calls against a real `KanbanContext` |

**Coverage:** Use `cargo tarpaulin` to verify no untested paths exist. 100% line coverage is the floor, not the goal — every assertion must verify observable behavior or an invariant, not just execute a code path.

**Full-graph, all-backend coverage (mandatory before implementation):**

Red tests written before the implementation must prove the behavior for the *entire* entity graph on *every* backend — not a representative entity on one backend. This is a hard requirement, not aspirational: the gaps below are exactly how a silent SQLite data-loss bug shipped (KAN-863 — restoring an archived board cascaded its whole subtree away — while a green in-memory suite gave false confidence).

- **Every backend, not just in-memory.** Any operation whose persistence semantics can differ by backend — anything touching relational cascades (`ON DELETE CASCADE`), foreign keys, marker/join tables, or migrations — MUST have a red test against `SqliteStore` (and the JSON backend) too. In-memory maps do not model FK cascade, so a green in-memory test is necessary but never sufficient. When a `DataStore` method is overridden per backend, each override earns its own test; prefer extending the shared contract tests (`kanban-service/src/test_helpers/contract`) so all backends are held to one spec.
- **Assert the whole graph, not the root.** For any operation on an entity that OWNS a subtree (board → columns → cards; board → sprints; card → sprint logs) — and for the dependency edges among a board's cards, which live in the workspace-global graph keyed on card id rather than being FK-owned — asserting the root returned to a collection (e.g. `boards().len() == 1`) does NOT prove its contents survived. "The container came back" is not "the container's contents came back." Seed a NON-TRIVIAL graph (≥1 column, card, sprint, and a dependency edge) and assert every owned-or-referenced entity type is present/absent as expected.
- **Reversibility is an identity invariant.** `archive`↔`restore` and `delete`↔`undo` must be the identity over the FULL entity graph. Every reversible operation gets a round-trip test per backend: seed graph → forward → assert hidden/removed → inverse → assert the ENTIRE graph is back (ids, positions, WIP limits, sprint bindings, edges), reloading from disk where the backend persists.
- **Enumerate every entity the change can touch.** Before writing code, list each entity type the operation reads or writes — the entity itself plus everything it owns or references — and write a red assertion for each. A test that covers `columns` but not `cards`/`sprints`/`edges` is under-specified; enrich it before implementing.
- **New primitives get a semantic floor, not a token test.** When a change adds a `DataStore` method with a per-backend default (e.g. a marker-only vs row-deleting split), the red suite must pin the SEMANTIC difference on the backend that diverges — a default that delegates to the wrong sibling is a silent data-loss footgun, so test the override, not just the default.

**Refactoring for testability:** If a function cannot be tested in isolation, refactor before writing tests:
- Extract logic from handlers/renderers into pure functions
- Introduce trait abstractions for dependencies (e.g. I/O, time)
- Use `mockall` for mocking traits where real I/O is impractical

## Inspirations from lazygit

- **Keyboard-driven**: Vim-like navigation
- **Panel-based layout**: Multiple views (boards, columns, cards)
- **Contextual commands**: Bottom panel shows available shortcuts
- **Fast navigation**: hjkl movement, quick jumps
- **Visual clarity**: Clear separation of concerns in UI

## Development Workflow

0. **Tests First**: Follow the TDD workflow in [Testing](#testing) — write and present failing tests before any implementation.
1. **Domain First**: Define models in `kanban-domain`
2. **Persistence Layer**: Implement storage in `kanban-persistence`
3. **Service Layer**: Orchestrate operations in `kanban-service`
4. **TUI Components**: Build UI in `kanban-tui`
5. **Integration**: Wire up in `kanban-cli`

## Commit Message Convention

Use conventional commits with the crate name as scope, dropping the `kanban-` prefix:

```
<type>(<crate>): <description>
```

**Types:** `feat`, `fix`, `test`, `refactor`, `chore`, `docs`

**Scope:** crate name without the `kanban-` prefix — e.g. `tui`, `domain`, `service`, `persistence`, `cli`, `mcp`, `core`

**Examples:**
```
feat(tui): preselect first board and refresh card view on startup
fix(service): handle empty board list on context init
test(tui): preselect first board and refresh card view on startup
refactor(domain): extract card sorting into pure function
```

Split commits by type — tests and implementation go in separate commits.

## Guidelines

- **No comments** unless documenting public APIs or complex algorithms
- **Small, focused modules**: Each file should have < 300 lines
- **Reusability**: Extract common patterns into traits
- **Type safety**: Leverage newtype pattern (e.g., `BoardId`, `CardId`)
- **Immutability**: Prefer immutable data, use `&mut` only when necessary
