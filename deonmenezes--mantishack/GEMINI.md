Safe operations (install, scan, read, generate): DO IT.
Dangerous operations (apply patches, delete, git push): ASK FIRST.

---

## SESSION START

**On first message:**
VERY IMPORTANT: follow these steps in order.
1. Read `.startup-output` using the Read tool, then output its contents verbatim as a fenced code block (``` with no language tag). Do NOT paraphrase or reformat. (The SessionStart hook generates this file automatically before your first message.)
2. On a single line, output "Quick commands:" then list the /mantis-agentic, /mantis-scan, /mantis-fuzz, /mantis-web commands (don't explain what they do) and note /commands for the full list.
3. If the `sage_inception` tool is present in your available MCP tools, load `core/sage/CLAUDE.md` (persistent-memory workflow). If absent, SAGE is not installed — skip silently and do not mention it.

---

## EXECUTION RULES

When a skill, command file, or user message specifies a literal command (`Execute: foo`, a fenced shell block as the action, or "run X"), execute it verbatim. Do not add pipes (`| tail`, `| head`, `| grep`), redirects (`2>&1`, `>/dev/null`), flags (`--verbose`, `-q`), wrappers (`timeout`, `nice`), or `cd` prefixes.
MANTISHACK pipelines emit progress lines, real-time cost tracking, and the `OUTPUT_DIR=<path>` sentinel that downstream lifecycle steps parse. Truncating or filtering that stream breaks both operator visibility and orchestration.

Exception: when the skill itself shows the modification (e.g. a documented `| tee logfile` pattern), follow what the skill prints.

---

## COMMANDS

/mantis-project - Project management: create, list, status, coverage, findings, diff, merge, report, clean, export
/mantis-scan /mantis-fuzz /mantis-web /mantis-agentic /mantis-codeql /mantis-analyze - Security testing
/mantis-exploit /mantis-patch - Generate PoCs and fixes (beta)
/mantis-validate - Exploitability validation pipeline (see below)
/mantis-understand - Code understanding: map attack surface, trace flows, hunt variants (see below)
/mantis-diagram - Generate Mermaid visual maps from /mantis-understand or /mantis-validate output (see below)
/mantis-annotate - Per-function prose annotations (manual or LLM-emitted) attached to source files

**Coverage:** When asked about coverage, run `libexec/mantishack-coverage-summary` (no args = active project). Use `--detailed` for per-file table, `--gaps` for unreviewed functions. See `.claude/skills/coverage.md` for mark/unmark and the full API.

**Note:** `/mantis-agentic` runs scan → dedup → prep → analysis (with validation methodology). Use `--sequential` to bypass parallel orchestration. Use `--understand` to pre-map the codebase before scanning, and `--validate` to run the full validation pipeline on exploitable findings afterwards. Both flags are opt-in. Multi-model: `--model` is repeatable — multiple models each independently analyse every finding, then results are correlated; `--consensus`, `--judge`, and `--aggregate` add optional review/synthesis models.
/mantis-crash-analysis - Autonomous crash root-cause analysis (see below)
/mantis-oss-forensics - GitHub forensic investigation (see below)
/mantis-scorecard - Inspect per-model reliability across decision classes; ask natural-language questions about which model is good at what (see below)
/mantis-create-skill - Save approaches (alpha)

---

## PROJECTS

Projects are opt-in named workspaces that corral analysis runs into a shared directory. Commands with `--project <name>` or after `/mantis-project use <name>` write output to the project directory. Without a project, commands behave as before (timestamped dirs under `out/`).

```
/mantis-project create myapp --target /path/to/code -d "Description"
/mantis-project use myapp
/mantis-scan                          # output goes to project dir
/mantis-project status                # shows all runs
/mantis-project findings              # shows merged findings across runs
/mantis-project coverage              # shows tool coverage summary
/mantis-project report                # merged view across all runs
/mantis-project correlate             # cross-run finding correlation
/mantis-project clean --keep 3        # delete old runs
/mantis-project none                  # clear active project
```

See `/mantis-project help` for full command list.

---

## DEFAULT TARGET DIRECTORY

When a command like `/mantis-scan`, `/mantis-agentic`, `/mantis-validate`, `/mantis-codeql`, or `/mantis-fuzz` is run **without a path argument**, resolve the default target in this order:

1. **Active project target:** the run lifecycle script reads the `.active` symlink to find the project target automatically
2. **Caller's directory:** if `$MANTISHACK_CALLER_DIR` is set (launcher saves the user's cwd before switching to the MANTISHACK repo dir), use it
3. **Ask the user** for the target path

Do not use the current working directory as a fallback — it is always the MANTISHACK repo dir, not the user's target. Do not use any of these if the user already specified a path.

---

## RUN LIFECYCLE

When running any analysis command (`/mantis-scan`, `/mantis-validate`, `/mantis-understand`, `/mantis-codeql`, `/mantis-fuzz`, `/mantis-web`), use the run lifecycle stubs to create the output directory and track status:

**Before starting work:**
```bash
libexec/mantishack-run-lifecycle start <command> --target <resolved_target> [--out <dir>]
```
Always pass `--target` with the resolved target path (see DEFAULT TARGET DIRECTORY for resolution order). Optionally pass `--out <dir>` to use a specific output directory. The last line of output is `OUTPUT_DIR=<path>` — use that path for all subsequent output files.

**After successful completion:**
```bash
libexec/mantishack-run-lifecycle complete "$OUTPUT_DIR"
```

**On failure:**
```bash
libexec/mantishack-run-lifecycle fail "$OUTPUT_DIR" "error description"
```

The `start` command automatically resolves the output directory using the active project (via `.active` symlink) or the default `out/` directory. Do not construct output paths manually.

**If `start` fails (non-zero exit):** STOP. Report the error to the user. Do not proceed with the command.

**Note:** `/mantis-validate` uses `libexec/mantishack-validation-helper 0` instead of `mantishack-run-lifecycle` — it bundles lifecycle management with inventory building.

Commands run via `python3 mantishack.py` (scan, agentic, codeql, fuzz, web) manage lifecycle internally — do not call the stubs separately for those.

### Coverage tracking

The coverage tracking plugin (`plugins/coverage/`) tracks which source files the LLM reads during analysis via a PostToolUse hook. Loaded automatically by the launcher. Logs file paths to a manifest in the active run directory, converted to `coverage-record.json` when the run completes. Zero overhead when no run is active.

---

## SECURITY: UNTRUSTED REPOS

When scanning untrusted repositories:

- **Environment sanitisation**: `MantishackConfig.get_safe_env()` strips environment variables that tools may shell-evaluate (`TERMINAL`, `EDITOR`, `VISUAL`, `BROWSER`, `PAGER`). Always use `get_safe_env()` when spawning subprocesses.
- **File path injection**: Never interpolate file paths from scanned repos into shell command strings. Use list-based `subprocess` arguments.

---

## OUTPUT STYLE

**Status values:**
- In JSON: snake_case (`exploitable`, `confirmed`, `ruled_out`, `disproven`)
- In human-readable output (reports, terminal): Title Case (`Exploitable`, `Confirmed`, `Ruled Out`)
- Never ALL_CAPS (`EXPLOITABLE`, `CONFIRMED`, `RULED_OUT`)

**No red/green status indicators:**
- Do not use 🔴/🟢 - perspective-dependent (bad for defenders ≠ bad for researchers)
- Other emojis are fine (⚠️, ✓, etc.)

---

## CRASH ANALYSIS

The `/mantis-crash-analysis` command provides autonomous root-cause analysis for C/C++ crashes.

**Usage:** `/mantis-crash-analysis <bug-tracker-url> <git-repo-url>`

**Agents:**
- `crash-analysis-agent` - Main orchestrator

- `gcov-coverage` - Code coverage collection
- `line-execution-checker` - Fast line execution queries

**Requirements:** rr, gcc/clang (with ASAN), gdb, gcov

---

## OSS FORENSICS

The `/mantis-oss-forensics` command provides evidence-backed forensic investigation for public GitHub repositories.

**Usage:** `/mantis-oss-forensics <prompt> [--max-followups 3] [--max-retries 3]`

**Agents:**
- `oss-forensics-agent` - Main orchestrator
- `oss-investigator-gh-archive-agent` - Queries GH Archive via BigQuery
- `oss-investigator-github-agent` - Queries live GitHub API
- `oss-investigator-wayback-agent` - Recovers deleted content (Wayback/commits)
- `oss-investigator-local-git-agent` - Analyzes cloned repos for dangling commits
- `oss-investigator-ioc-extractor-agent` - Extracts IOCs from vendor reports

- `github-evidence-kit` - Evidence collection, storage, verification
- `github-commit-recovery` - Recover deleted commits
- `github-wayback-recovery` - Recover content from Wayback Machine

**Requirements:** `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` for BigQuery

**Output:** `.out/oss-forensics-<timestamp>/forensic-report.md`

---

## EXPLOITABILITY VALIDATION

The `/mantis-validate` command validates that vulnerability findings are real, reachable, and exploitable.

**Usage:** `/mantis-validate <target_path> [--vuln-type <type>] [--findings <file>]`

**Stages:** 0 → A → B → C → D → E → F → 1 (see `.claude/skills/exploitability-validation/PIPELINE.md`)

**Skills** (in `.claude/skills/exploitability-validation/`):
- `PIPELINE.md` - Stage naming convention (letters = LLM, numbers = mechanical)
- `SKILL.md` - Shared context, gates, execution rules
- `stage-0-inventory.md` through `stage-1-outputs.md` - Stage instructions

**Output:** `out/exploitability-validation-<timestamp>/validation-report.md`

**Pipeline handoff:** For `/mantis-understand` → `/mantis-validate` workflows, use the same `--out` directory so `context-map.json`, `checklist.json`, and `flow-trace-*.json` are shared automatically.

---

## CODE UNDERSTANDING

The `/mantis-understand` command provides deep, adversarial code comprehension for security research.

**Usage:** `/mantis-understand <target> [--map] [--trace <entry>] [--hunt <pattern>] [--teach <subject>] [--out <dir>]`

**Modes:**
- `--map` — Build context: entry points, trust boundaries, sinks → `context-map.json`
- `--trace <entry>` — Follow one data flow source → sink with full call chain → `flow-trace-<id>.json`
- `--hunt <pattern>` — Find all variants of a pattern across the codebase → `variants.json`
- `--teach <subject>` — Explain a framework, library, or pattern in depth (inline)

**Skills** (in `.claude/skills/code-understanding/`):
- `SKILL.md` — Gates, config, output format
- `map.md` — Entry point enumeration, trust boundary mapping, sink catalog
- `trace.md` — Step-by-step data flow tracing with branch coverage
- `hunt.md` — Structural, semantic, and root-cause variant analysis
- `teach.md` — Framework/pattern explanation with security conclusion

**Output:** Resolved by `libexec/mantishack-run-lifecycle start understand` (project dir or `out/understand_<timestamp>/`)

**Pipeline integration:** `/mantis-validate` Stage 0 automatically imports `/mantis-understand` output via the bridge (`core/orchestration/understand_bridge.py`). No `--out` alignment needed — the bridge searches: (1) co-located files, (2) project siblings, (3) global `out/` by target path + SHA-256 freshness. When found, it pre-populates `attack-surface.json`, imports flow traces as attack paths, and marks entry points/sinks as high-priority in the checklist.

---

## DIAGRAM GENERATION

The `/mantis-diagram` command generates Mermaid visual maps from `/mantis-understand` and `/mantis-validate` JSON outputs, giving researchers a visual representation of code flows, sources, sinks, trust boundaries, attack trees, and attack paths. Consider this 
very much a WIP but it could be of use for those wanting to see relationships and flows better. 

**Usage:** `/mantis-diagram <out-dir> [--target <name>] [--type context-map|flow-trace|attack-tree|attack-paths|all]`

**What gets rendered:**
- `context-map.json` → flowchart LR: entry points → trust boundaries → sinks; unchecked flows as dashed edges
- `attack-surface.json` → same layout (Stage B equivalent view)
- `flow-trace-*.json` → flowchart TD per trace: each hop in the call chain, tainted variables, branches, attacker control summary
- `attack-tree.json` → flowchart TD: knowledge graph nodes styled by status (confirmed/disproven/exploring/unexplored)
- `attack-paths.json` → flowchart TD per path: step chain with proximity score and blocker annotations

**Output:** `diagrams.md` written into the target directory (or `--stdout` to print)

**Implementation:** `libexec/mantishack-render-diagrams <out-dir> [--target <name>]`

**When to run:** Diagrams are auto-generated at the end of `/mantis-validate` and `/mantis-understand --map`/`--trace`. Use `/mantis-diagram <dir>` to re-render after manual edits to JSON outputs.

---

## ANNOTATIONS

The `/mantis-annotate` command attaches free-form prose to individual functions, stored as markdown mirroring the source tree. Operators write manual review notes; LLM passes (`/mantis-agentic`, `/mantis-understand`) emit per-function annotations automatically.

**Storage:** `<base>/<source_path>.md` — one annotation file per source file, with `## function_name` sections, an HTML-comment metadata line, and a free-form prose body. The base directory defaults to the active project's `<output_dir>/annotations`.

**Status enum:** `clean` (reviewed, no concern) / `suspicious` (real bug, not exploitable) / `finding` (exploitable) / `entry_point` / `sink` / `trust_boundary` / `flow_step` / `unchecked_flow` / `error`.

**Source attribution:** Every annotation carries `metadata.source=human` or `metadata.source=llm`. LLM-driven writes pass `overwrite=respect-manual` so a manual operator note is never silently clobbered. Operators using `/mantis-annotate add` set `source=human` by default.

**Staleness:** Annotations stamped with `--lines N-M` carry a `metadata.hash` short prefix of the function's source. `/mantis-annotate stale` re-computes and lists annotations whose source has drifted.

**Where annotations come from:**
- `/mantis-agentic` — emits one annotation per analysed finding under `<run_output_dir>/annotations/`. Status mapped from the LLM's `is_true_positive` × `is_exploitable`. Body is the LLM's `reasoning`.
- `/mantis-understand --map` / `--trace` — post-processor synthesises annotations for entry points, sinks, trust boundaries, unchecked flows, and per-step trace records.
- `/mantis-annotate add` — operator-driven manual entry.

**Operator workflow:**
```
/mantis-annotate add src/auth.py check_pw --status clean -m "Constant-time compare, no taint"
/mantis-annotate ls --status finding              # cross-run view in active project
/mantis-annotate show src/auth.py check_pw
/mantis-annotate edit src/auth.py check_pw        # opens .md in $EDITOR
/mantis-annotate stale --target ~/repos/myproj    # source drifted since note written
```

**Substrate:** `core/annotations/` — atomic write via tempfile + rename, path-traversal defended (rejects `..` segments and absolute paths), function-name and metadata-value validation prevents on-disk format corruption.

---

## PROGRESSIVE LOADING

**When scan completes:** Load `tiers/analysis-guidance.md` (adversarial thinking)
**When validating exploitability:** Load `.claude/skills/exploitability-validation/SKILL.md` (gates, methodology)
**When validation errors occur:** Load `tiers/validation-recovery.md` (stage-specific recovery)
**When developing exploits:** Load `tiers/exploit-guidance.md` (constraints, techniques)
**When errors occur:** Load `tiers/recovery.md` (recovery protocol)
**When requested:** Load `tiers/personas/[name].md` (expert personas)
**When running /mantis-understand:** Load `.claude/skills/code-understanding/SKILL.md` (gates, config) plus the relevant mode file: `map.md`, `trace.md`, `hunt.md`, or `teach.md`

---

## BINARY ANALYSIS

**Flow: Find vulnerabilities FIRST, then check exploitability.**

1. **Analyze the binary** - Find vulnerabilities (buffer overflows, format strings, etc.)
2. **If vulnerabilities found** - Run exploit feasibility analysis (MANDATORY)

```python
from packages.exploit_feasibility.api import analyze_binary, format_analysis_summary

# MANDATORY: Run this after finding vulnerabilities
result = analyze_binary('/path/to/binary')
print(format_analysis_summary(result, verbose=True))
```

**DO NOT use checksec or readelf instead** - they miss critical constraints like:
- Empirical %n verification (glibc may block it)
- Null byte constraints from strcpy (can't write 64-bit addresses)
- ROP gadget quality (0 usable gadgets = no ROP chain)
- Input handler bad bytes
- Full RELRO blocks .fini_array too (not just GOT)

**The `exploitation_paths` section tells you if code execution is actually possible** given the system's mitigations (glibc version, RELRO, etc.).

**SMT integration (optional, requires `pip install z3-solver`):**

Two places Z3 is used — both degrade gracefully when absent:

1. **Binary / one-gadget** (`packages/exploit_feasibility/smt_onegadget.py`): checks
   whether a one-gadget's register/memory constraints are satisfiable given a crash
   state. Result in `exploitation_paths[vuln].one_gadget_info.smt_feasibility`.

2. **CodeQL dataflow** (`packages/codeql/smt_path_validator.py`): checks whether the
   branch conditions along a dataflow path are jointly satisfiable. `unsat` → false
   positive, skip LLM. `sat` → concrete input values fed into the LLM prompt and
   `DataflowValidation.prerequisites`. Best coverage: CWE-190, CWE-120/122,
   CWE-193, CWE-476.

---

## EXPLOIT DEVELOPMENT

**Verify constraints BEFORE attempting any technique.** Many hours are wasted on architecturally impossible approaches.

**MANDATORY: Check `exploitation_paths` verdict first:**
- Unlikely = no known path, suggest environment changes
- Difficult = primitives exist but hard to chain, be honest about challenges
- Likely exploitable = good chance, proceed with suggested techniques

**Follow the chain_breaks** - these tell you exactly what WON'T work.
**Follow the what_would_help** - these tell you what MIGHT work.

**ALWAYS offer next steps, even for Difficult/Unlikely verdicts:**
- Try alternative targets (if available)
- Focus on info leaks only
- Run in older environment (Docker)
- Move on to other targets

**Never just stop** - let the user decide how to proceed.

See `tiers/exploit-guidance.md` for detailed constraint tables and technique alternatives.

---

## STRUCTURE

Python orchestrates everything. Claude shows results concisely.
Never circumvent Python execution flow.
- never disclose remote OLLAMA server location in code, comments, logs etc
- **Python path safety:** Never add anything to `sys.path` except `os.environ["MANTISHACK_DIR"]`. Use the hard lookup (KeyError if unset) — no fallbacks, no `'.'`, no `os.getcwd()`, no hardcoded paths. The `libexec/` scripts handle their own path setup via `Path(__file__).resolve().parents[1]` and do not need `MANTISHACK_DIR`.
