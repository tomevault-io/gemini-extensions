# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to AI coding agents working with code in this repository. pi is the coding agent Agent Fleet installs for; Claude Code takes part only as a coms peer (see `docs/claude-code-coms-bridge.md`).

## Terminal File Links

- In terminal responses, link local files using descriptive Markdown link text and an absolute `file:///` URL, e.g. `[Agent guide](file:///absolute/path/to/AGENTS.md)`. Do not use relative Markdown link targets or show bare paths instead of named links. This avoids Zed/macOS opening errors.

## Repository Overview

Agent Fleet — a Pi-centered multi-agent orchestration system (agent-hub dispatcher, herdr fleet control plane, coms peer messaging, Hermes remote control) plus a library of lifecycle skills and agent personas for pi. Skills live in two roots: fleet-native `skills/` and the vendored upstream import `vendor/agent-skills-upstream/skills/` (native wins on name collisions — see `docs/UPSTREAM-SKILLS.md`).

## Project Philosophy

Read [docs/PHILOSOPHY.md](docs/PHILOSOPHY.md) before proposing or revising Agent
Fleet plans, architecture, or process changes. It is the canonical project
direction: deterministic lifecycle control, proportional workflows, adaptive
model assistance, and evidence-based completion. Plans and design reviews must
include a proportionate alignment note and distinguish current guarantees from
proposed behavior. Surface conflicts for a maintainer decision rather than
silently changing these principles.

## Skill-Driven Execution

Agent Fleet runs on a **skill-driven execution model** powered by this repository's `/skills` directory.

### Core Rules

- If a task matches a skill, you MUST invoke it
- Skills are located in `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`
- Never implement directly if a skill applies
- Always follow the skill instructions exactly (do not partially apply them)

### Intent → Skill Mapping

The agent should automatically map user intent to skills:

- Feature / new functionality → `spec-driven-development`, then `incremental-implementation`, `test-driven-development`
- Planning / breakdown → `planning-and-task-breakdown`
- Bug / failure / unexpected behavior → `debugging-and-error-recovery`
- Code review → `code-review-and-quality`
- Refactoring / simplification → `code-simplification`
- API or interface design → `api-and-interface-design`
- UI work → `frontend-ui-engineering`

### Lifecycle Mapping

The agent should internally follow this lifecycle and invoke the matching skill at each phase:

- DEFINE → `spec-driven-development`
- PLAN → `planning-and-task-breakdown`
- BUILD → `incremental-implementation` + `test-driven-development`
- VERIFY → `debugging-and-error-recovery`
- REVIEW → `code-review-and-quality`
- SHIP → `shipping-and-launch`

This lifecycle is normally implicit — the agent maps user intent to the right skill without being asked.

The repo also ships slash commands as explicit lifecycle entry points, `af-`-prefixed
in `.pi/prompts/`:

- `/af-spec` → `spec-driven-development`
- `/af-plan` → `planning-and-task-breakdown`
- `/af-build` → `incremental-implementation` + `test-driven-development`
- `/af-test` → `test-driven-development`
- `/af-review` → `code-review-and-quality`
- `/af-code-simplify` → `code-simplification`
- `/af-ship` → `shipping-and-launch`

Workspace installation is outside the prompt/skill layer: use the deterministic
`agent-fleet setup`, `agent-fleet doctor`, and `agent-fleet uninstall` CLI commands.

Whether triggered implicitly or via a command, the agent MUST invoke the underlying skill — never inline the steps.

### Execution Model

For every request:

1. Determine if any skill applies (even 1% chance)
2. Invoke the appropriate skill
3. Follow the skill workflow strictly
4. Only proceed to implementation after required steps (spec, plan, etc.) are complete

### Anti-Rationalization

The following thoughts are incorrect and must be ignored:

- "This is too small for a skill"
- "I can just quickly implement this"
- "I’ll gather context first"

Correct behavior:

- Always check for and use skills first

This keeps workflow enforcement identical across every supported runtime.

## Orchestration: Personas, Skills, and Commands

This repo has three composable layers. They have different jobs and should not be confused:

- **Skills** (`skills/<name>/SKILL.md`) — workflows with steps and exit criteria. The *how*. Mandatory hops when an intent matches.
- **Personas** (`agents/<role>.md`) — roles with a perspective and an output format. The *who*.
- **Slash commands** (`.pi/prompts/af-*.md`) — user-facing entry points. The *when*. The orchestration layer.

Composition rule: **the user (or a slash command) is the orchestrator. Personas do not invoke other personas.** A persona may invoke skills.

The multi-persona pattern this repo endorses in a plain session is **parallel fan-out with a merge step** — used by `/af-ship` to run `code-reviewer`, `security-auditor`, and `test-engineer` concurrently and synthesize their reports. Do not build a "router" persona that decides which other persona to call; that's the job of slash commands and intent mapping. The `agent-hub` harness is the sanctioned exception: the generated dispatcher prompt dispatches specialists under a Verification Contract, with that orchestration living in the harness rather than a peer persona calling another.

See [docs/agents.md](docs/agents.md) for the decision matrix and [references/orchestration-patterns.md](references/orchestration-patterns.md) for the full pattern catalog.

**Claude Code interop:** a Claude Code pane joins a fleet as a coms peer, not as a persona host. It carries no persona file — `runner: claude-code` in `.pi/agents/peers.yaml` spawns the CLI plus `.pi/agent-fleet/scripts/coms-claude-bridge.ts`, and the peer's name is what other agents address. `.pi/agents/dispatch-policy.yaml` can then route an agent-hub team member's `dispatch_agent` call to that live peer. See `docs/claude-code-coms-bridge.md`.

## Creating a New Skill

### Directory Structure

```
skills/
  {skill-name}/           # kebab-case directory name
    SKILL.md              # Required: skill definition
    scripts/              # Required: executable scripts
      {script-name}.sh    # Bash scripts (preferred)
  {skill-name}.zip        # Required: packaged for distribution
```

### Naming Conventions

- **Skill directory**: `kebab-case` (e.g. `web-quality`)
- **SKILL.md**: Always uppercase, always this exact filename
- **Scripts**: `kebab-case.sh` (e.g., `deploy.sh`, `fetch-logs.sh`)
- **Zip file**: Must match directory name exactly: `{skill-name}.zip`

### SKILL.md Format

```markdown
---
name: {skill-name}
description: {One sentence describing what the skill does, followed by one or more "Use when" trigger conditions. Include trigger phrases like "Deploy my app" or "Check logs" when helpful.}
---

# {Skill Title}

{Brief overview of what the skill does and why it matters.}

## How It Works

{Numbered list explaining the skill's workflow}

Equivalent headings like `Workflow`, `Core Process`, or `When to Use` are fine when they communicate the same structure clearly.

## Usage (Optional)

Include this section only if the skill ships runnable helpers under `scripts/`. Markdown-only skills can omit both the section and the directory entirely.

```bash
bash /mnt/skills/user/{skill-name}/scripts/{script}.sh [args]
```

**Arguments:**
- `arg1` - Description (defaults to X)

**Examples:**
{Show 2-3 common usage patterns}

## Output

{Show example output users will see}

## Present Results to User

{Template for how Claude should format results when presenting to users}

## Troubleshooting

{Common issues and solutions, especially network/permissions errors}
```

### Best Practices for Context Efficiency

Skills are loaded on-demand — only the skill name and description are loaded at startup. The full `SKILL.md` loads into context only when the agent decides the skill is relevant. To minimize context usage:

- **Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines** — put detailed reference material in separate files
- **Write specific descriptions** — helps the agent know exactly when to activate the skill
- **Use progressive disclosure** — reference supporting files that get read only when needed
- **Prefer scripts over inline code** — script execution doesn't consume context (only output does)
- **File references work one level deep** — link directly from SKILL.md to supporting files

### Script Requirements

- Use `#!/bin/bash` shebang
- Use `set -e` for fail-fast behavior
- Write status messages to stderr: `echo "Message" >&2`
- Write machine-readable output (JSON) to stdout
- Include a cleanup trap for temp files
- Reference the script path as `/mnt/skills/user/{skill-name}/scripts/{script}.sh`

### Creating the Zip Package

After creating or updating a skill:

```bash
cd skills
zip -r {skill-name}.zip {skill-name}/
```

### End-User Installation

Document these installation methods for users:

**Deterministic workspace lifecycle:**
```bash
npx @chankov/agent-fleet@latest setup
```

Use Default/Full and named features rather than raw item selectors; see
`docs/npm-install.md`.

**pi (manual):**
```bash
cp -r skills/{skill-name} .pi/skills/
```
