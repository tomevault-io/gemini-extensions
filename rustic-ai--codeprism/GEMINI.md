# Development Best Practices - Team Process & Workflow

**Purpose:** Process enforcement and team development standards for enterprise Rust projects. Use this for team environments requiring strict quality gates, design documentation, and automated workflow enforcement.

**When to use:** Enterprise teams, critical systems development, open source projects with multiple contributors, or any environment requiring rigorous development process.

## Autonomous Agent Operation

**Rule: Agent must operate autonomously through the entire development cycle unless user input is explicitly required.**
Why: Autonomous operation enables faster iteration, consistent quality, and reduces human bottlenecks. Agents can maintain higher standards through systematic self-review than ad-hoc human review.

**Autonomous Operation Requirements:**
- Agent proceeds through design → implementation → testing → documentation without waiting for human approval
- User input only required for: initial requirements, major architectural decisions, and final acceptance
- All intermediate steps (design review, code review, testing) performed by agent self-review
- Agent must document all decisions and rationale for human audit trail

**Rule: Agent must perform comprehensive self-review before proceeding to each next step.**
Why: Self-review catches issues early, ensures quality standards, and maintains development velocity. Systematic review prevents compounding errors across development phases.

```

## Design-First Development

**Rule: All features must have comprehensive design documents created and self-reviewed before implementation.**
Why: Design documents prevent over-engineering, ensure consistency, and catch architectural issues early. Self-review by agent ensures systematic evaluation against established criteria.

```markdown
# [Feature Name] Design Document Template

## Problem Statement
- What problem are we solving?
- Why is this important for the project?

## Proposed Solution
- High-level approach
- Component interactions  
- Data flow diagrams

## API Design
- Function signatures with Rust types
- Error types and handling strategy
- Trait definitions if applicable

## Implementation Plan
- Step-by-step breakdown
- Dependencies and feature flags
- Testing strategy with coverage targets

## Alternatives Considered
- Other approaches evaluated
- Why this solution was chosen

## Success Criteria
- How will we know this works?
- Performance requirements (specific benchmarks)
- Integration requirements
**Rule: Create design documents in `/docs/design/[feature-name].md` with comprehensive self-review against quality criteria.**
Why: Standardized location ensures findability, systematic self-review catches design flaws early, and documented rationale enables audit trails for future reference.

**Use the design document template from project-setup.md for consistent formal documentation.**

## Strict TDD Workflow

**Rule: Follow Red-Green-Refactor cycle with evidence in commit history.**
Why: TDD ensures comprehensive test coverage, prevents regression bugs, and results in more maintainable code. Commit evidence proves process compliance.

**TDD Cycle Implementation:**
```rust
// Step 1: RED - Write failing test FIRST
#[test]
fn test_event_validation_rejects_empty_id() {
    let event = CPTEEvent {
        event_id: String::new(), // Invalid
        event_kind: "SENSOR_READING".to_string(),
        payload: serde_json::Value::Null,
        // ... other fields
    };
    
    let result = validate_event(event);
    
    assert!(result.is_err());
    assert!(matches!(
        result.unwrap_err(),
        ValidationError::InvalidEventId(_)
    ));
}

// Step 2: GREEN - Minimal implementation that passes
pub fn validate_event(event: CPTEEvent) -> Result<ValidatedEvent, ValidationError> {
    if event.event_id.is_empty() {
        return Err(ValidationError::InvalidEventId(
            "event_id cannot be empty".to_string()
        ));
    }
    
    todo!("Implement remaining validation")
}

// Step 3: REFACTOR - Improve code quality
pub fn validate_event(event: CPTEEvent) -> Result<ValidatedEvent, ValidationError> {
    let validator = EventValidator::new();
    validator.validate_id(&event.event_id)?;
    validator.validate_schema(&event)?;
    validator.validate_timestamps(&event)?;
    
    Ok(ValidatedEvent::from(event))
}
```

**Rule: Enforce minimum 90% code coverage for all new features.**
Why: High coverage ensures edge cases are tested, reduces production bugs, and provides confidence for refactoring.

## Enhanced Documentation Standards

**Rule: Include performance characteristics and safety guarantees in all public API documentation (beyond basic rustdoc from rust-essentials.md).**
Why: Performance docs help users make informed decisions, safety guarantees prevent misuse, and thread-safety notes prevent concurrency bugs.

```rust
/// Processes events through the validation and persistence pipeline.
///
/// # Arguments
/// * `event` - The event to process with required fields populated
/// * `policy_tags` - Access control tags for filtering
/// 
/// # Returns
/// Returns `Result<ProcessingResult, ProcessingError>` with processing status
/// 
/// # Errors
/// - `ValidationError` if event structure is invalid
/// - `PolicyViolationError` if access control fails
/// - `StorageError` if persistence fails
/// 
/// # Performance
/// - Typical processing time: <5ms for standard events
/// - Memory usage: O(1) relative to event size  
/// - Throughput: >1000 events/second on standard hardware
/// 
/// # Safety
/// - Thread-safe: Can be called concurrently from multiple threads
/// - No data races: Internal synchronization ensures consistency
/// - Memory safe: No possibility of buffer overflows or use-after-free
/// 
/// # Examples
/// ```rust
/// let event = CPTEEvent { /* ... */ };
/// let result = process_event(event, vec!["PUBLIC".to_string()])?;
/// assert!(result.success);
/// ```
pub fn process_event(
    event: CPTEEvent, 
    policy_tags: Vec<String>
) -> Result<ProcessingResult, ProcessingError> {
    // Implementation
}
```

**Rule: Document module architecture with design principles and component relationships.**
Why: Module docs provide high-level understanding, design principles guide usage, and component relationships clarify dependencies.

```rust
//! Event Processing Engine - Core validation and persistence
//!
//! This module implements the event processing pipeline with validation,
//! policy enforcement, and durable persistence capabilities.
//!
//! # Key Components
//! - [`EventValidator`] - Validates event structure and business rules
//! - [`PolicyEnforcer`] - Implements access control and data sovereignty  
//! - [`EventPersister`] - Handles durable storage with integrity verification
//! - [`ReplicationService`] - Manages cross-node event synchronization
//!
//! # Design Principles
//! - **Immutability**: Events are never modified after persistence
//! - **Determinism**: Identical input produces identical results
//! - **Performance**: Sub-10ms processing for standard operations
//! - **Reliability**: Zero data loss with proper error handling
//!
//! # Architecture
//! ```text
//! Input Event -> Validator -> Policy -> Persister -> Result
//!                    |          |         |
//!                    v          v         v
//!                 Schema    Access    Integrity
//!                 Check     Control   Verification
//! ```
//!
//! For detailed design, see: `/docs/design/event-processing.md`
```

## Git Workflow Standards

**Rule: Use structured branch naming and detailed commit messages with metrics.**
Why: Consistent naming enables automation, detailed commits document changes, and metrics track quality improvements.

## Git Workflow Standards

**Rule: Use structured branch naming and detailed commit messages with metrics.**
Why: Consistent naming enables automation, detailed commits document changes, and metrics track quality improvements.

**Branch Naming Convention:**
```bash
# Feature branches
feature/[design-doc-name]
feature/user-authentication
feature/event-validation

# Bugfix branches  
fix/[issue-number]-[description]
fix/42-memory-leak-in-parser

# Documentation branches
docs/[topic]
docs/api-documentation-update
```

**Commit Message Template:**
```bash
git commit -m "feat(component): implement feature X

- Add specific functionality with error handling
- Implement comprehensive validation logic  
- Add performance optimizations for large datasets
- Resolve issue #123

Design doc: /docs/design/feature-x.md
Tests: 47 tests, all passing (coverage: 94%)
Benchmarks: <5ms average processing time
Breaking changes: None"
```

**Branch Naming Convention:**
```bash
# Feature branches
feature/[design-doc-name]
feature/user-authentication
feature/event-validation

# Bugfix branches  
fix/[issue-number]-[description]
fix/42-memory-leak-in-parser
```

**Commit Message Format:**

**Rule: Include latency requirements and performance tests for all critical paths.**
Why: Performance tests prevent regression, latency requirements ensure user experience, and benchmarks guide optimization efforts.

```rust
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_event_processing_latency_requirement() {
    let event = create_test_event();
    let start = Instant::now();
    
    let result = process_event(event, vec!["PUBLIC".to_string()]).await;
    
    let duration = start.elapsed();
    assert!(result.is_ok(), "Processing failed: {:?}", result.err());
    assert!(
        duration.as_millis() < 10, 
        "Processing took {}ms, expected <10ms", 
        duration.as_millis()
    );
}

#[test]
fn test_memory_usage_stays_constant() {
    let initial_memory = get_memory_usage();
    
    for _ in 0..1000 {
        let event = create_test_event();
        let _ = validate_event(event);
    }
    
    let final_memory = get_memory_usage();
    let memory_growth = final_memory - initial_memory;
    
    assert!(
        memory_growth < 1024 * 1024, // 1MB
        "Memory grew by {} bytes, expected <1MB",
        memory_growth
    );
}

// Benchmark critical functions
use criterion::{black_box, criterion_group, criterion_main, Criterion};

fn benchmark_event_validation(c: &mut Criterion) {
    let event = create_benchmark_event();
    
    c.bench_function("event_validation", |b| {
        b.iter(|| validate_event(black_box(event.clone())))
    });
}
```

## Pre-commit Automation

**Rule: Implement automated quality gates with pre-commit hooks.**
Why: Automated checks prevent bad code from entering the repository, reduce review time, and enforce standards consistently.

```yaml
# .pre-commit-config.yaml
repos:
  - repo: local
    hooks:
      - id: design-doc-check
        name: Verify design document exists for features
        entry: python scripts/check_design_doc.py
        language: system
        always_run: true
        
      - id: cargo-fmt
        name: Cargo Format Check
        entry: cargo fmt --all -- --check
        language: system
        types: [rust]
        
      - id: cargo-clippy
        name: Cargo Clippy (no warnings)
        entry: cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
        language: system
        types: [rust]
        
      - id: cargo-test
        name: Run all tests
        entry: cargo test --all-features
        language: system
        types: [rust]
        
      - id: coverage-check
        name: Enforce 90% code coverage
        entry: bash -c 'cargo tarpaulin --skip-clean --out xml && python scripts/check_coverage.py --min 90'
        language: system
        types: [rust]
        
      - id: performance-check
        name: Run performance benchmarks
        entry: cargo bench --bench critical_path_benchmarks
        language: system
        types: [rust]
```

## Self-Review Process

**Rule: Agent must perform systematic self-review using comprehensive checklists to ensure quality and process compliance.**
Why: Systematic self-review prevents oversights, ensures consistent quality, and maintains development velocity without human bottlenecks.

```markdown

- [ ] Performance characteristics documented with measurements
- [ ] Thread safety and memory safety explicitly noted
- [ ] Error handling uses Result<T, E> patterns consistently
- [ ] No TODO/FIXME comments (create GitHub issues if needed)

- [ ] Design decisions documented with clear rationale
```

## Quality Gate Enforcement

**Rule: Implement automated quality gates that block progression without meeting standards.**
Why: Automation ensures consistent enforcement, prevents quality regression, and maintains standards without requiring human oversight.

**Automated Quality Gates:**
- Design phase: Self-review checklist must be completed before implementation
- Implementation phase: All code quality rules must pass before testing
- Testing phase: 90% coverage + all tests passing before documentation
- Documentation phase: All doc tests passing before completion
- No manual approval required - agent proceeds when quality gates are met
- Use automation tools configured in project-setup.md (pre-commit hooks, CI/CD pipeline)

## User Input Requirements

**Rule: Minimize user input to essential decision points only.**
Why: Autonomous operation maximizes development velocity while ensuring human oversight remains focused on high-value decisions.

**User Input Required For:**
- Initial requirements and acceptance criteria definition
- Major architectural decisions affecting system design
- Breaking change approval for public APIs
- Final feature acceptance and deployment authorization
- Security-sensitive changes requiring human verification

**User Input NOT Required For:**
- Design document creation and review
- Code implementation following established patterns
- Test creation and execution
- Documentation writing and validation  
- Quality gate enforcement and progression
- Intermediate code reviews and iterations
