# Agent Workflow Rules - SWE Agent Compliance

**Purpose:** Specific workflow rules for AI/SWE agents to ensure proper integration with development tools, processes, and quality gates. These rules govern agent behavior when working autonomously on software development tasks.

**When to use:** AI agents, automated development workflows, SWE bots, or any autonomous system performing development tasks.

## Work Organization and Planning

**Rule: Create temporary files in the cursor_workspace folder**
Why: Creaitng files under /tmp requires user aproaval and breaks the flow, so create them in a folder in workspace that is not commited to git.

**Rule: Organize work as milestones, phases, and priorities - never add timelines, schedules, or estimates.**
Why: Agile development focuses on value delivery over time predictions. Estimates are often inaccurate and create false expectations. Priorities and milestones provide clear direction without artificial time constraints.

**Implementation:**
```markdown
# ✅ GOOD - Use milestones and priorities
## Milestone 1: Core Authentication
- High Priority: JWT token validation
- Medium Priority: Session management  
- Low Priority: Multi-factor authentication

## Phase 2: User Management
- User creation and validation
- Role-based access control
- Account management features

# ❌ BAD - Avoid timelines and estimates  
## Week 1 (Est. 15 hours)
- [ ] JWT implementation (5 hours)
- [ ] Session management (8 hours)
- [ ] Testing (2 hours)
```

## Git Workflow Compliance

**Rule: After completing work on an issue make sure all the changes are committed and there are no staged or untracked changes**
Why: The work done is in the files and it is essential to commit the files to git. Untracked, staged artifacts left behind will mean that our project will not be functional. 

**Rule: Never bypass git pre-commit hooks - always run validation before committing.**
Why: Pre-commit hooks maintain code quality and catch issues early. Bypassing them, even for documentation, can introduce inconsistencies and break CI/CD pipelines.

**Enforcement:**
- **NEVER use:** `git commit --no-verify`
- **NEVER use:** `git commit -n` 
- **ALWAYS run:** Standard `git commit` to trigger pre-commit validation
- **Applies to:** All commits including docs-only, formatting fixes, or minor changes

```bash
# ✅ ALWAYS do this
git add .
git commit -m "docs: update API documentation"

# ❌ NEVER do this - even for docs
git commit --no-verify -m "docs: quick fix"
git commit -n -m "format: minor spacing"
```

**Rule: Always push your changes upstream, once you have a successful commit.**
Why: Pushing changes upstream makes sure that the changes are available for others to work with, safe and protected from system failures and also closes the relevant issues on GitHub automatically.

## Issue Resolution Verification

**Rule: Before committing, verify the change completely fixes the issue and meets all requirements.**
Why: Incomplete solutions create technical debt, confuse stakeholders, and require additional work cycles. Thorough verification prevents rework and ensures deliverable quality.

**Pre-commit Verification Checklist:**
```markdown
Before committing any issue fix:
- [ ] Read the original issue requirements completely
- [ ] Verify each requirement is addressed in the code
- [ ] Test the specific scenarios mentioned in the issue
- [ ] Ensure no placeholder code or TODOs remain
- [ ] Verify error cases and edge conditions are handled
- [ ] Check that related functionality still works
- [ ] Confirm the fix doesn't introduce new issues
```

**Code Review Questions:**
- Does this change solve the exact problem described?
- Are all acceptance criteria met?
- Would someone reviewing this code understand the complete solution?
- Are there any stubs, TODOs, or incomplete implementations?

## Design-First Development

**Rule: Write detailed solution/design in issue comment before starting work - stick to it or update it.**
Why: Solution comments serve as implementation contracts, prevent scope creep, and provide audit trails. They complement the formal design documents from dev-best-practices.md with issue-specific implementation plans.

**Solution Comment Template (for GitHub issue comments):**
```markdown
## Solution Design

### Problem Analysis
- Root cause of the issue
- Impact on existing functionality
- Requirements and constraints

### Proposed Approach
```rust
// High-level API design
pub struct UserManager {
    repository: Arc<dyn UserRepository>,
    validator: UserValidator,
}

impl UserManager {
    pub async fn create_user(&self, request: CreateUserRequest) -> Result<User, UserError> {
        // Implementation approach
    }
}
```

### Implementation Steps
1. **Phase 1**: Core data structures and validation
2. **Phase 2**: Database integration and persistence
3. **Phase 3**: API endpoints and error handling
4. **Phase 4**: Testing and documentation

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for validation logic
- Integration tests for database operations
- End-to-end tests for API workflows

### Breaking Changes
- None expected / List any breaking changes

### Alternative Approaches Considered
- Approach A: Trade-offs and why not chosen
- Approach B: Trade-offs and why not chosen
```

**Design Change Protocol:**
- If implementation diverges from design: **Update the solution comment first**
- Explain why the change was necessary
- Document new approach with same detail level
- Tag relevant stakeholders if scope significantly changes

## GitHub Integration

**Rule: Use `closes #<issue_number>` in commit messages to auto-close issues.**
Why: Automatic issue closure maintains clean project state, provides clear audit trails, and links commits to their motivating issues for better project history.

**Commit Message Format:**
```bash
# ✅ GOOD - Auto-closes issue
git commit -m "feat(auth): implement JWT token validation

- Add JWT signing and verification
- Include expiration handling
- Add comprehensive error types
- Add unit tests with 95% coverage

closes #123"

# ✅ GOOD - Multiple issues
git commit -m "fix(parser): handle edge cases in CSV processing

- Fix null value handling
- Add validation for malformed headers  
- Improve error messages

closes #456, closes #789"

# ❌ BAD - Missing issue reference
git commit -m "feat(auth): implement JWT validation"
```

**Issue Reference Guidelines:**
- Use `closes #123` for bug fixes and feature implementations
- Use `addresses #123` for partial solutions requiring follow-up
- Use `related to #123` for tangential changes
- Always include issue number in commit message
- One commit should typically close one issue (unless they're tightly coupled)

## System Integration

**Rule: Use `date` command to check current date for time-sensitive operations.**
Why: Autonomous agents need accurate temporal context for logging, versioning, and time-sensitive business logic. System time provides reliable reference point.

**Usage Patterns:**
```bash
# ✅ Getting current date for logging
CURRENT_DATE=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
echo "Build started on: $CURRENT_DATE"

# ✅ Timestamp for version generation
VERSION="1.0.0-$(date +%Y%m%d)"

# ✅ Time-sensitive file operations
BACKUP_FILE="config_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).toml"
```

**When to use date command:**
- Creating timestamped backups or logs
- Generating version numbers with date components  
- Time-sensitive business logic (expiration, scheduling)
- Audit trail generation
- Determining if cached data is stale

## Tool-Specific Workarounds

**Rule: When using GitHub CLI through run_terminal_cmd, add `| cat` to prevent pager crashes.**
Why: The GitHub CLI uses interactive pagers that can cause crashes in non-interactive terminal environments. Piping to `cat` forces plain text output.

**GitHub CLI Commands:**
```bash
# ✅ GOOD - Prevents pager issues
gh pr list | cat
gh issue view 123 | cat  
gh repo view | cat
gh api repos/:owner/:repo/pulls | cat

# ❌ BAD - May crash in automated environments
gh pr list
gh issue view 123
gh repo view
```

**Other Tool Considerations:**
```bash
# Similar pattern for other interactive tools
git log --oneline | cat
less +F /var/log/app.log | cat  # If using less in automation
man command | cat              # If programmatically reading man pages
```

**When to apply this rule:**
- Any `gh` command that might display paginated output
- Running in CI/CD environments
- Automated scripts using GitHub CLI
- Terminal commands in containerized environments
- Any context where stdout will be captured/processed

## Compliance Verification

**Agent Self-Check Before Any Action:**
```markdown
- [ ] Am I organizing work by priorities/milestones (not timelines)?
- [ ] Am I running full git commit (not bypassing pre-commit)?
- [ ] Have I verified this change completely fixes the issue?
- [ ] Did I write/update the solution design comment?
- [ ] Does my commit message include "closes #<number>"?
- [ ] Do I need current date for this operation?
- [ ] Am I using "| cat" with any gh commands?
```

**These rules ensure autonomous agents work effectively within established development workflows while maintaining quality and process compliance.**
