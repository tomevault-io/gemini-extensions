## Architecture

### Audio Pipeline (direct streaming — no chunking, no backpressure queue)

- `AudioRecorder` — mic capture, raw `AVAudioPCMBuffer` via callback
- `SystemAudioCapture` — ScreenCaptureKit system audio, `CMSampleBuffer` → `AVAudioPCMBuffer`
- `BufferConverter` — `AVAudioConverter` wrapper for format conversion
- `SpeechTranscriberEngine` — streams raw audio → `SpeechAnalyzer` → `TranscriptSegment`
- `RecordingSessionManager` — orchestrates engines + diarization; uses `RecordingState` enum (`.idle`, `.starting`, `.recording`, `.stopping`)
- `DiarizationManager` — FluidAudio wrapper; streaming Sortformer (primary) + batch accumulation fallback

### LLM Engine

- `LLMEngine` (actor) — centralized inference, serialized via `inferenceGate`. Core: `complete(system:prompt:)`. Convenience: `generate()`, `chat()`, `analyzeRaw()`, `rephrase()` (in extension files). Also hosts LangGraph writing-agent nodes and streaming analysis. All extension methods MUST route through `complete()`/`completeStream()`.
- `LLMEngineStatus` (@MainActor @Observable) — singleton busy flag (`isBusy`) driven by `LLMEngine.inferenceQueueDepth`. UI views use `.disabled(LLMEngineStatus.shared.isBusy)` to prevent concurrent AI operations.
- `ModelManager` (@MainActor @Observable) — model downloads, activation, endpoint scanning (split: +Download, +Discovery, +HuggingFace)

### Data Layer

- `MeetingStore` (@MainActor @Observable) — encrypted JSON persistence (split: +AI, +Diarization, +Metadata, +Persistence, +Search, +SeedData, +WelcomeMeeting, Protocols)
- `MeetingNote` (struct, Codable, Sendable) — segments, speakers, speakerSegments, hasSpeakerData
- `EncryptionManager` — AES-256-GCM at rest, 7-day migration window for legacy unencrypted data

### Tests (Swift Testing framework — @Suite, @Test, #expect, NOT XCTest)

- 94 `@Test` methods across 9 files in `LogueTests/LLMIntegration/`
- `LLMTestHarness.swift` — shared harness with `LenientSuggestionItem`, `repairTruncatedJSON()`, `stripMarkdownFences()`
- Tests run real inference against local MLX model
- Grammar suite uses 10-minute timeout; all others 5 minutes

## Code Standards (Enforced by Review)

### Security

- **Never use `[0]` on FileManager URL arrays.** Use `.first ?? URL.temporaryDirectory` — the array can be empty on edge-case system configurations.
- **Always wrap user content in XML delimiters** when injecting into LLM prompts:
  - Meeting transcripts → `<transcript>...</transcript>`
  - Document content → `<content>...</content>`
  - PII categories → `<categories>...</categories>`
  - This applies to ALL prompt construction — summaries, titles, chat, search, fact-check, vocabulary, PII detection, space suggestions. No exceptions.
- **Require HTTPS for all user-supplied endpoints** (except localhost/127.0.0.1). Validate before saving.
- **Sanitize all user-provided strings** (titles, keywords, model names, space names) before embedding in LLM prompts — truncate length, strip control characters. Use the pattern: `String($0.prefix(N)).filter { !$0.isNewline && $0.asciiValue != 0 }`
- **Use regex validation for structured input** (email, OTP, API keys) — never rely on `contains("@")` or length-only checks.
- **Log URLs with `url.host` only** — never log `url.absoluteString` anywhere in the codebase. This includes error handlers (`didFailProvisionalNavigation`, `didFail`), not just success paths.
- **URL-encode user-supplied path parameters** before interpolating into API endpoint strings. Use `.addingPercentEncoding(withAllowedCharacters: .urlPathAllowed)` to prevent path traversal.
- **Keychain is only for secrets.** Store only sensitive data in Keychain (user-supplied external-API keys). Public keys and non-secret configuration go in `UserDefaults` — simpler and no Keychain permission issues. All AI inference is on-device; external API providers are optional and their keys are user-supplied.
- **Sparkle EdDSA private key** lives only in the GitHub Actions secret `SPARKLE_PRIVATE_KEY` — never store it in the repo. The public key (`SUPublicEDKey`) is embedded in `Info.plist` via `project.yml`. Updates are served entirely from GitHub (appcast in-repo, assets on GitHub Releases) — there is no backend.
- **Use typed constants for notification userInfo keys** — never string literals like `"success"` in `userInfo` dictionaries.
- **Entitlements:**
  - Dev builds: sandbox OFF for development convenience (documented in comments)
  - Release builds: sandbox ON via `Logue.release.entitlements`
  - Every security exception (`allow-jit`, `disable-library-validation`, etc.) must have a comment explaining why it's needed

### Concurrency and Thread Safety

- **LLMEngine is an actor but Swift actors are reentrant.** Use `inferenceGate` serialization pattern — capture the current gate, create a new task that chains onto it, and assign the new gate synchronously (before any suspension point). Both `complete()` and `completeStream()` participate in the same gate chain. Never assume actor methods run atomically across suspension points.
- **ALL inference MUST route through `complete()` or `completeStream()`.** Never call `session.streamResponse()` or `session.messages` directly from extension methods — this bypasses the `inferenceGate` and causes session races when multiple AI features run concurrently. Extension methods (grammar, clarity, tone, rephrase) should build system/user prompt strings and delegate to `complete()`.
- **Always add `@unchecked Sendable` safety documentation.** Every usage must have a comment explaining what provides thread-safety (lock, dispatch queue, immutability).
- **Always add `nonisolated(unsafe)` documentation.** Explain why the marker is needed and what guarantees safety.
- **Re-check state after async permission checks.** Recording/mic state may change during the `await` — always re-validate with a guard after resuming.
- **Use `RecordingState` enum** (`.idle`, `.starting`, `.recording`, `.stopping`) — never use separate boolean flags for state machines.
- **Use `[weak self]` in all Task closures** except when `self` is a singleton AND the task is trivially short. When in doubt, use `[weak self]`.
- **Use version counters instead of boolean flags** to suppress feedback loops in `onChange` handlers. Booleans reset via `Task { flag = false }` race with rapid state changes; counters don't. Sync `lastSeenVersion = currentVersion` in the handler that **increments** the counter (not in the handler that reads it), so subsequent legitimate changes are not blocked.
- **Check `Task.isCancelled` between expensive resource allocations.** Insert cancellation guards between session creation and prewarm, between model download and activation, etc.

### Error Handling

- **Never use silent `try?` for ANY operation.** This includes file I/O, directory creation, network requests, and data decoding. Use `do/catch` with logging. In static initializers where no Logger instance is available, use `os_log(.error, ...)`. **Exception:** `try? await Task.sleep(for:)` is acceptable — it only throws `CancellationError`, and silencing cancellation is idiomatic in Swift Concurrency.
- **Always use `withRetry()` / `withRetryOptional()`** from `RetryHelper.swift` instead of manual `for attempt in 1...3` loops.
- **Log LLM JSON decode failures** with the error message AND truncated raw response. Silent `try? JSONDecoder()` makes debugging impossible.
- **Add timeout guards to all polling/busy-wait loops.** Use `ContinuousClock.now + .seconds(N)` — never busy-wait indefinitely.
- **Validate array bounds before subscripting** in callbacks and closures where data may have changed since the closure was created. Use `guard index < array.count` before `array[index]`.

### LLM Integration

- **Validate context window before ALL LLM calls.** Truncate input to fit `maxKVSize - outputTokens - promptOverhead`. This applies to: summaries, chat, titles, vocabulary enhancement, fact-check, PII detection, space suggestion, document chat, grammar, clarity, tone, rephrase, `generate()`. The pattern: `let maxChars = ((LLMEngine.mlxParameter.parameters.maxKVSize ?? 16384) - reservedTokens) * 4`. Use `LLMEngine.maxInputChars(reservedTokens:)` or the private `truncatedContext(_:reservedTokens:)` helper in extension files.
- **Always pass explicit `maxTokens`** to `completeStream()` calls — the default (512) is too low for chat responses. Use `maxTokens: 2048` for conversational AI.
- **Rate-limit inference calls.** Use `maxInferenceQueueDepth` to reject calls when the queue is too deep (prevents GPU memory thrashing during bulk operations).
- **Retry with stricter format instructions** when JSON parse fails before falling back to plain-text. Add "IMPORTANT: You MUST output ONLY a valid JSON object" on retry.
- **Check available memory before loading models.** Use `mach_task_basic_info` to verify at least 512MB available — reject with clear error if insufficient.
- **Limit collection sizes in prompts.** Cap space descriptions at 10, content titles at 5, keywords at 5. Large collections exhaust context window.
- **Validate LLM output against source document.** When the LLM returns text that maps back to the document (e.g., vocabulary `original`, suggestion `original`), verify the text actually exists in the document body (case-insensitive) before presenting to the user. Discard hallucinated items that don't match.
- **Use `LLMEngineStatus.shared.isBusy`** to disable AI-triggering UI controls while inference is in progress. This prevents concurrent AI operations that could race on the LLM session. Add `.disabled(LLMEngineStatus.shared.isBusy)` to all buttons that trigger `LLMEngine.complete()` or `completeStream()`.

### Data and Persistence

- **Use `decodeIfPresent` with defaults** for array fields in Codable types (`segments`, `actionItems`, etc.). Never use bare `try container.decode()` for fields that could be missing in older data formats.
- **Encryption migration window is 7 days** (not 30). After that, unencrypted fallback is permanently disabled.
- **Use hash-based change detection** for `didSet` cache invalidation on large arrays — avoid invalidating on every property mutation.

### Code Organization

- **All delay constants go in `AppConstants.Delays`** — never hardcode `Task.sleep(for: .seconds(2))` or `DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 0.3)` inline.
- **Large service classes must use extension files.** Pattern: `FooManager.swift` (core) + `FooManager+Feature.swift` (extensions). Each under ~500 lines.
  - `MeetingStore` → 8 extension files (+AI, +Diarization, +Metadata, +Persistence, +Search, +SeedData, +WelcomeMeeting, Protocols)
  - `ModelManager` → +Download, +Discovery, +HuggingFace
- **Extension-visible members:** When splitting a class into extension files, Swift requires `private` members to become `internal` for cross-file access. Mark these with `// Extension-visible: +FileName` comments explaining which extensions need access. Do not call extension-visible members from outside the class and its extensions. Prefer `let` constants and `private(set)` where possible to limit mutation surface.
- **NotificationCenter observers:** Always use block-based API (`addObserver(forName:)`) that returns a token. Store the token and remove in `applicationWillTerminate` or `deinit`. Never use `addObserver(self, selector:)`.
- **Exponential backoff for device retries.** Start at 50ms, double each attempt, cap at 400ms. Never use fixed retry delays.

### SwiftLint Compliance

**Write code that passes SwiftLint without suppressions.** The project enforces strict rules via pre-commit hooks (SwiftFormat + SwiftLint). Code that requires `swiftlint:disable` comments is a smell — fix the underlying issue instead.

**Rules to follow when writing code:**

- **No force unwrapping (`!`)** — use `guard let`, `if let`, or `?? default`. The `force_unwrapping` rule is opt-in and enforced.
- **No force casting (`as!`)** — use `as?` with guard. Exception: CF bridging (AXValue, AXUIElement) where `CFGetTypeID()` verification precedes the cast — Swift has no safe alternative for CF types.
- **Function body length ≤ 60 lines** — break large functions into helpers. If a function genuinely can't be split (complex state machine, UI builder), add `// swiftlint:disable:next function_body_length` with a reason.
- **Cyclomatic complexity ≤ 15** — simplify branching or extract helper methods.
- **File length ≤ 800 lines** — split into extension files. Suppression acceptable only for static data files (seed data, templates).
- **Identifier names: 2-60 chars, no `_` prefix** on non-private properties. Use descriptive names (`downloadAndActivateInternal` not `_downloadAndActivate`).
- **Line length ≤ 150 chars** (warning), ≤ 200 chars (error).

**Acceptable suppressions (with comment explaining why):**

- `force_unwrapping` on compile-time constant `URL(string:)!` and `UUID(uuidString:)!` in seed data / static definitions
- `force_cast` on CF bridging after `CFGetTypeID()` verification (no safe alternative in Swift)
- `file_length` on static data files (seed data, built-in templates) — these are data, not logic
- `function_body_length` on complex view builders or state machines that are cohesive units

### Style

- **`guard let` for runtime URLs** — never force-unwrap URLs constructed from runtime values.
- **Prefer `@Observable` over `ObservableObject`** for new classes. Use `@State` (not `@ObservedObject`) when consuming `@Observable` singletons in views.
- **Prefer `Task.sleep` over `DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter`** in SwiftUI views and async contexts. GCD is acceptable only in AppKit delegate callbacks (NSTextView, NotificationCenter block handlers) where structured concurrency doesn't apply.
- **Use `DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter` with `AppConstants.Delays`** — never hardcode `TimeInterval` literals in GCD calls.
