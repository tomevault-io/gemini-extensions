## Prefer the rag-rat MCP for code browsing

This repo ships `rag-rat` — a local repo-intelligence index and MCP server — and it is indexed by
its own server (dogfooded). **Heavily prefer the `rag-rat` MCP tools over raw `grep`/`cat`/file
reads when browsing or understanding code.** One MCP call returns more context, faster, than a
shell sweep, and it surfaces *drive-by repo memories* (source-anchored invariants, decisions,
risks) attached to the code you're touching — context you would otherwise never see.

Reach for these first:

- **`semantic_search`** — "where is this concept implemented?" Returns current source chunks with
  inline graph (callers/callees), git, and GitHub papertrail, all validated against current source.
- **`symbol_lookup`** — exact/fuzzy symbol resolution (Rust/TS/Kotlin/C/C++/Python/Swift/Go), with
  any bound memories attached.
- **`impact_surface`** — the coding preflight before editing a symbol: graph callers/callees,
  tests, git history, papertrail, and **repo memories** crossing the call path. Run it before
  changing anything non-trivial.
- **`find_callers` / `trace_callees`** — reverse/forward graph traversal instead of grepping for
  call sites.
- **`read_chunk`** — current text for a chunk with anchor validation + graph + memories.
- **`repo_brief` / `repo_clusters`** — orientation (spine, churn, god-modules, ownership clusters).
- **`important_symbols`** — load-bearing symbols by (SCIP-aware) PageRank; pass `personalize` to
  bias toward what you're editing. Compiler-grade once `rag-rat oracle run` has run.

**Symbol handle:** symbol-returning tools emit `id`, an opaque `sym_<hex>` token — the stable handle
to cache and pass back into graph/impact/memory tools as the `id` param (copy verbatim; never parse
it as a number). There is no numeric `symbol_id` on the wire (it's an internal rowid reassigned on
every reindex). Use `ref` (the `path::name` qualified name) for the human-readable identity. The
symbol-tool params are `ref` / `id` / `lang` (formerly `symbol_path` / `logical_symbol_id` /
`language`).

Why this beats grep here:
- Results carry **provenance**: confidence labels, coverage warnings, and raw evidence, so you can
  judge them rather than trust them blindly.
- **Drive-by memories**: a function may carry an `Invariant`/`Decision`/`Risk` memory that explains
  a non-obvious constraint. Grep can't show you that; the MCP tools attach it automatically. See
  *Record durable learnings as rag-rat memories* below — capturing these is part of the job.
- The index is **kept fresh by git hooks** (see below), so what the MCP returns matches HEAD.

Fall back to direct file reads/edits for the actual *writing* of code, and to confirm exact text
before an `Edit`. Use the MCP to *find and understand*; use the file tools to *change*. (The MCP
server is read-only on source — it never edits files; it writes only its own SQLite index.)

## Record durable learnings as rag-rat memories

**Running the gate is required, not optional — producing a record is not.** Before you finish a
task, ask: **could the next agent recover this by reading the repo?** If yes, don't record it. A
memory that restates the code, the types, the tests, or the history leaves the reader *worse off*
than none at all — it costs attention and returns nothing. On most tasks the honest answer is
**record nothing**, and that is the common outcome, not a failure to try hard enough. What passes
the gate is what you had to read three files and reason for ten minutes to learn, and that the repo
states nowhere — don't let that evaporate.

**Rejected alternatives lead.** The approach *not* taken leaves no artifact anywhere — not in the
diff, not in the types, not in the history — which makes it at once the most-asked question about
unfamiliar code and the least-supplied answer. If your work settled a choice, record the alternative
and why it lost (`RejectedAlternative`) before anything about what the code now does.

**Why rag-rat and not your own notes:** rag-rat memories live in this repo's shared index, so they
surface for **every** agent that uses the rag-rat MCP — Claude Code, Codex, and any future tool —
not just the one that wrote them. An agent's private/session memory (e.g. Claude Code's file memory,
Codex's own store) is invisible to the others. rag-rat is the **cross-agent memory layer**; put
anything another agent would benefit from here.

**Translate; never store the trajectory.** What you did, in what order, is worth less than nothing
to the next reader — a replayed trace scores worse than having no memory at all. Distill it to a
situation and an action — *when X, do Y, because Z* — and quote the evidence you generalised from
(the failing line, the error, the constraint). Situated questions are not answered by general
advice, and the quote is what spares the reader from trusting a summary of a summary.

**Revise before you create.** A memory that has drifted actively misleads, while a missing one merely
fails to help — so correcting or retiring a wrong record is the highest-value write available.
`memory_search` first: if something already covers the ground, `memory_update` it; reach for
`memory_create` only when nothing does, and `memory_mark_obsolete` when nothing actionable survives.

**Terseness is a staleness strategy, not a style preference.** Every extra detail is one more thing a
later change can falsify, and a record that contradicts the source on one line gets distrusted on all
of them. State the rule and the reason, then stop. Aim under 900 characters; most memories land at
300–600. Past that you are usually restating code the reader can go read.

How to do it well:
- **Anchor to the tightest stable target.** Prefer an `id` binding (the `sym_<hex>` logical-symbol
  handle — self-heals across cross-file moves via the relocation engine); fall back to a `path`
  binding for file/area-level notes, or a commit/GitHub ref for historical rationale.
- **Pick the right `kind`:** `Invariant` (must stay true), `Decision`/`RejectedAlternative` (why it's
  this way / why not the other), `Risk` / `BugPattern` (footguns), `PerformanceNote`, `PlatformQuirk`,
  `FFIBoundary`. The body carries the *why* and *how to apply* — not just *what*.
- **The title states the rule, not the story.** `#407 E3a: …`, `C4.3b`, `V042 … (phase A5)` are
  titles nobody can act on: they name the work, and the reader has to open the body to find out
  whether it concerns them. Name the constraint or the trap instead, and leave an issue number as a
  trailing pointer only when it earns its place. Max 160 characters.
- **Write the present tense, not a changelog.** A memory says what is true NOW and what to do about
  it. "Fixed in #123", "used to fail open", "stage 2 landed the split" are unactionable: they cost
  the reader attention, go stale on the next change, and teach them to distrust the rest of the
  entry. When updating a memory whose warning no longer applies, rewrite the body to state the rule
  that now holds — do not append a status section. An issue or test *name* is a fine pointer; the
  story is not.
- **After large refactors**, run `rag-rat memory doctor` and re-anchor anything it flags `gone`
  (`rag-rat memory rebind <id> --symbol <name>`); content-confirmed moves re-anchor automatically.
- This works the same from any agent: Claude Code calls the MCP `memory_create` tool; the `rag-rat`
  CLI exposes the equivalents — use whichever your harness has.

If the MCP returns empty results, the self-index may be stale or pointed at the wrong root —
`rag-rat index --discover` then `rag-rat reconcile` refreshes it.

The grep-augmentation PreToolUse hook augments Claude Code's `Grep` and Bash grep/rg/ag calls with
symbol and repo-memory context automatically; it ships with the rag-rat plugin (install the plugin —
see the README's "Connect it to your agent (MCP)" section).

## Public artifacts describe the change, not the process that produced it

PR descriptions, commit messages, and issue text are read by humans reviewing the **change**. Keep
them about the code — the problem, the fix, the rationale, how it was verified. Do **not** narrate
the process that produced them:

- No agent/subagent counts or fan-out language ("a 12-agent sweep found…", "each verifier reported…").
- No multi-agent / workflow / orchestration / delegation framing, and no internal phase or round
  codes (`C3.1`, "round 6"). Give the change a descriptive title and reference the issue number.
- No naming of AI assistants or AI review tooling, and no review play-by-play ("caught in review and
  fixed before merge"). State the final behavior; if a concern shaped the design, explain the concern
  on its own terms.

A reviewer should not be able to tell from a PR whether one agent or twenty produced it — only what
changed and why. Durable, checkable references are encouraged: issue/PR numbers, commit SHAs, test
names, file paths.

Memories are held to the same bar for a different reason. A phase code, a round number, or a review
play-by-play inside a memory is not a privacy problem — it is the narration that goes stale first
and buries the rule underneath it. Durable, checkable references belong there too; the story does
not.

## Repo orientation

- Rust workspace, 13 crates in a layered DAG (Rust 2024 edition):
  - `rag-rat-base` — foundation: config, repo identity/discovery, language + embedding-model
    registries, path classification, canonical JSON, locks, logging.
  - `rag-rat-db` — the SQLite substrate: schema/migrations (+ the `MigrationHooks` seam),
    storage, meta, chunk-text store/compression.
  - domain layers on base+db: `rag-rat-llm` (embedder providers, cookbook provisioning),
    `rag-rat-papertrail` (provider-neutral GitHub/GitLab tracker mirrors), `rag-rat-clones`
    (fingerprints, postings, refine/antiunify), and `rag-rat-oracle` (SCIP/LSP evidence,
    manifests, verdict store).
  - `rag-rat-query` — the read layer: graph/impact/symbol/tree queries, repo-memory reads +
    evidence resolution, pagerank, orientation primitives.
  - `rag-rat-dream` — deterministic memory-maintenance findings plus model-driven verify/compact
    passes, built on query+llm.
  - `rag-rat-oplog` — signed, hash-chained memory op-log: operation model, projection fold,
    account/authority substrate, content-candidate DAG, durable store.
  - `rag-rat-core` — the engine that remains: indexing + tree-sitter graph, the
    `IndexDatabase` query surface, memory-write orchestration, watcher, eval.
  - `rag-rat-sync` — iroh QUIC peer transport for exchanging signed op-log entries.
  - entrypoints: `rag-rat-mcp` (the STDIO MCP server) and `rag-rat-cli` (package name `rag-rat`,
    the CLI binary).
  All crates version in lockstep; see docs/releasing.md.
- `rag-rat.toml` (repo root) configures what gets indexed and the SQLite database path.

## Worktree correctness

All changes that affect indexing or worktree-overlay behavior MUST support both the main checkout and
linked worktrees sharing the same database. Every such change MUST include regression tests that
exercise worktree behavior, including active-checkout scope and sibling-checkout preservation or
isolation as applicable. Single-checkout coverage alone is not sufficient for index/overlay changes.

## Style

Follow the `rust-modern-style` conventions: closed/persisted enums use strum-backed stable tokens
behind `as_db_str`/`from_db_str`, `{self, ..}` imports for mixed lists, read/write-obvious DB method
names, injected time (`now_ms()`), parameter structs over long arg trains, `mod.rs` as a curated
index. Keep SQL in helpers named for the domain question, with invariant comments and tests
(migrations included).

## Build / test

```bash
cargo build
cargo nextest run -p rag-rat-core   # CI runs nextest (`cargo nextest run --workspace`); see .config/nextest.toml
cargo clippy --all-targets
cargo +nightly fmt   # CI uses nightly rustfmt; stable fmt silently diverges and reddens CI
```
