## Client = Rust, server = Bun (read this first)

- The shipping `climon` **client** is the **Rust** workspace under `rust/` (crates `climon-cli`, `climon-session`, `climon-pty`, `climon-store`, `climon-config`, `climon-logging`, `climon-proto`, `climon-remote`, `climon-install`, `climon-update`). **All client work — new features and bug fixes — goes in `rust/`.**
- The Bun/TypeScript client that used to live under `src/` (`src/index.ts`, `src/launcher.ts`, `src/session-host.ts`, `src/pty.ts`, `src/cli/`, `src/client/`, `src/daemon/`, `src/install/`, most of `src/remote/`, …) has been **removed** — it was rewritten in Rust. Do **not** try to run or restore it; all client work goes in the `rust/` crates. The TypeScript that remains under `src/` is the maintained dashboard server/web plus shared support modules (configuration, logging, i18n, session defaults, the remote-ingest helpers the server imports, and `src/update/pubkey.ts`, the Ed25519 key read by `rust/climon-update` at build time).
- The dashboard **server** (`climon-server`, built from `src/server.ts` with `src/server/` and `src/web/`) is **NOT legacy**. It is still Bun, still maintained, and is never rewritten. The Rust client interoperates with it byte-for-byte over the shared metadata/socket/config surfaces.
- See `docs/architecture.md` for the component breakdown.

## Workflow

- Always start new work in a fresh git worktree under the `.worktrees/` folder, never directly on the main or dev checkout. Create one per task with `git worktree add .worktrees/<branch-name> -b <branch-name>` (or check out an existing branch) and do all edits, builds, and tests there. The `.worktrees/` folder is gitignored.
- **Always open pull requests against the `dev` branch, never `main`.** `dev` is the integration branch; feature/fix PRs are squash-merged into it. Releases are **tag-driven**: they ship only when a `vX.Y.Z` tag is pushed, so a `dev` → `main` merge alone no longer cuts a release. See `docs/cutting-a-release.md` for the full runbook.
- **Always squash merge into `dev` unless explicitly told otherwise.** When merging a PR into `dev` (e.g. `gh pr merge --squash`), use a squash merge so each feature/fix lands as a single commit and keeps `dev` history linear. Only use a different merge strategy when the user specifically requests it.
- **Never squash merge `dev` into `main`, and never squash the automated `main` → `dev` back-merge PR.** Release/hotfix → `main` merges and the back-merge PR the Release workflow opens must all use a real merge commit (`gh pr merge --merge`), never `--squash` or `--rebase`, so `main` and `dev` keep a shared ancestor and the next release diff stays clean.
- **When cutting a release, first read [`docs/cutting-a-release.md`](../docs/cutting-a-release.md) and follow it exactly.** It is the authoritative runbook for the tag-driven flow. In short: prepare the release on a `release/*` (or `hotfix/*`) branch, bump the version there with `bun run release` (or bump `package.json` and the CLI fixtures in lockstep), merge to `main` with a real merge commit, then push the `vX.Y.Z` tag — pushing the tag is what ships. The golden CLI fixtures `fixtures/cli/version.txt` and `fixtures/cli/help.txt` embed `climon v<semver>` on line 1 and are asserted byte-for-byte by `rust/climon-cli/tests/cli_fixtures.rs`; the Release workflow's `version` job also refuses to ship unless the tag matches them. `scripts/release.ts` rewrites all three together; if you edit `package.json` by hand you MUST also bump the version token on line 1 of both fixtures, or `cargo test` (and CI) goes red.

## Local Copilot CLI skills

- Repo-local Copilot CLI skills live in `copilot-plugin/` (a per-session plugin, not installed globally). Load them with `copilot --plugin-dir copilot-plugin` from the repo root, then invoke a skill by describing the task (e.g. "update the changelog" runs the `update-changelog` skill). See `copilot-plugin/README.md`.

## Build, test, and lint commands

### Rust client (canonical — do client work here)

- The client crates live in `rust/`. Build with `cargo build` (or `cargo build --release`) from `rust/`.
- Run the Rust tests with `cargo test`; lint with `cargo clippy --all-targets`; format with `cargo fmt`.
- License/attribution gates use `cargo deny` and `cargo about` (`rust/deny.toml`, `rust/about.toml`).
- The shipped `climon` binary is built from `rust/climon-cli` and packaged by `scripts/compile.ts`.

### Bun server + tests

- Install dependencies with `bun install`. The project uses Bun (`packageManager: bun@1.3.10`) and TypeScript ESM.
- Build all runtime artifacts with `bun run build` (`build:web` dashboard bundle, `build:server` server entrypoint, `build:rust` Rust `climon` client). The `build:rust` step (`scripts/build-rust.ts`) installs a minimal Rust toolchain via rustup on demand when `cargo` is missing (skip with `CLIMON_SKIP_RUST_INSTALL=1`); the `postinstall` hook (`scripts/rust-toolchain.ts`) only reports toolchain status and never downloads during `bun install`.
- Compile release binaries with `bun run compile`; bump the version and create the matching git tag with `bun run release`.
- Type-check/lint with `bun run lint` or `bun run typecheck` (`tsc -p tsconfig.json --noEmit`).
- Run the full suite with `bun test tests`.
- Run a single test file with `bun test tests/config.test.ts`.
- Run one test by name with `bun test tests/config.test.ts -t "default config binds to localhost"`.
- Useful local entrypoints: `bun src/server.ts server` (canonical dashboard server) or `cargo run -p climon-cli -- <args>` from `rust/` (the client).

## High-level architecture

> The file paths below name the roles in the shared design. The **client** role (launcher, daemon, PTY, local attach client, remote bridge) is implemented in the Rust workspace under `rust/`; the **server** role is the Bun code under `src/server/` + `src/web/`. Make client changes in the Rust crates.

climon is a cross-platform PTY session manager with three main roles: the launcher/client, one detached daemon per session, and a dashboard server. The launcher (`rust/climon-cli`) writes session metadata, starts a detached daemon, waits for its socket, prints the dashboard URL, and attaches the local terminal. The daemon (`rust/climon-session`) owns the PTY (`rust/climon-pty`), scrollback ring buffer, client IPC, status transitions, and final persisted output.

The dashboard server (`src/server.ts`, `src/server/server.ts`) is stateless with respect to PTYs: it scans `~/.climon/sessions/*.json`, watches for metadata updates, serves REST/SSE/WebSocket APIs, and bridges browser WebSocket traffic to daemon sockets. The React 19 + Fluent UI dashboard lives under `src/web/` and is served from `src/server/assets.ts`; compiled builds embed the web bundle into the server binary.

The client and server are intentionally separate binaries. The Rust `climon` client is lean and delegates the `server` subcommand to the compiled `climon-server` binary (built from `src/server.ts`). Keep server-only code, embedded assets, React, Fluent UI, and xterm dependencies in the server entrypoint; the Rust client never embeds them.

Session state is filesystem-backed under `$CLIMON_HOME` (default `~/.climon`): `config.jsonc`, legacy `config.json` backups, session metadata JSON, final scrollback, daemon logs, and sockets/pipes. Metadata is the cross-process coordination boundary; `src/store.ts` writes metadata atomically and serializes per-process patch bursts.

Remote clients use an ingest/uplink bridge over Microsoft dev tunnels or a direct Windows/WSL same-machine connection. The remote client code lives in the Rust `climon-remote` crate; the Bun server keeps a small set of ingest helpers in `src/remote/ingest.ts` that it imports directly. Remote session metadata is materialized locally with namespaced IDs so the existing dashboard/session-list plumbing can treat local and remote sessions uniformly.

## Key conventions

- Use explicit `.js` extensions in TypeScript relative imports, matching the existing ESM/Bun pattern (`import { x } from "./module.js"`).
- Tests use `bun:test`; add focused tests under `tests/*.test.ts` near related existing tests rather than introducing another runner.
- Tests that touch climon state should isolate with `CLIMON_HOME` pointing at a temporary directory. Some socket/PTY tests need a real Linux filesystem temp dir because Unix sockets do not work reliably on all mounted filesystems.
- Preserve the session status and priority model from `src/types.ts` and `src/priority.ts`: `needs-attention` sorts first, then `running`, then terminal states, with user priority as an additional ordering input.
- The daemon is the single writer for live session state such as attention and exit transitions. Server APIs should avoid directly mutating daemon-owned live fields unless they are explicitly server-owned operations.
- Browser resize behavior is shared PTY state. Viewer resizes are clamped to the host terminal by default and reverted when the last browser viewer disconnects; update daemon, IPC, and web-terminal behavior together when changing this flow.
- Treat remote input as untrusted. Keep remote ID validation, metadata namespacing, patch allowlists, bounded mux frames, and loopback-only privileged dashboard APIs aligned with `docs/security.md`.
- Configuration is hierarchical for `climon config`: local `.climon/config.jsonc` files are checked from the cwd upward before global `$CLIMON_HOME/config.jsonc`; legacy `config.json` files are read for backward compatibility and migrated on first write. Writes use explicit `--local`/`--global` or the nearest existing config.
- Config settings are declared in `src/config-settings.ts` and feature flags (including their `status`) in `src/features.ts`. Whenever a config setting or feature flag is added, removed, renamed, re-scoped, retyped, or has its purpose, default, or status changed, update the registry, then **regenerate both the golden config fixtures with `bun scripts/gen-config-fixtures.ts` and the config docs/comments with `bun run docs:config`**, and keep the change backward compatible with existing config files. The fixtures under `fixtures/config/` are the shared source of truth for the Rust (`rust/climon-config/tests/fixtures.rs`) and Bun (`tests/config-fixtures.test.ts`) parity tests, so failing to regenerate them breaks the test suite.
- When adding a new feature that is gated behind an on/off toggle, **strongly prefer a feature flag** (`feature.<name>` declared in the parity pair `src/features.ts` + `rust/climon-config/src/features.rs`, carrying a maturity `status`) over a plain boolean config setting. Feature flags surface maturity in docs/help/dashboard and drive the enable warning; reserve plain config settings for tunable parameters (numbers, hosts, themes, intervals), not feature gating.
- When changing install or release behavior, check `scripts/`, `rust/climon-install`, and `src/release/` together because version bumping, binary compilation, PATH setup, and installer packaging are coupled.
- Keep docs in sync with behavior that users rely on: `README.md` for user-facing workflow, `docs/architecture.md` for component/data-flow changes, `docs/security.md` for remote or network-facing changes, and `docs/setup.md`/`docs/usage.md` for setup and command changes.
- Every new feature MUST ship with manual checks in `docs/manual-tests/`. Add or update a `phaseNN-<feature>.md` (or feature-named) file using the test-case shape from `docs/manual-tests/README.md` (ID, feature, preconditions, config-matrix cell, numbered steps, expected result, platforms, result-tracking row), and link it from the README index. A feature is not complete until its manual checks exist.
- Always keep the feature catalogue `docs/features.md` up to date. It is the living, code-grounded inventory of every feature, split into Client/Server/Dashboard/PWA × in-production/in-development sections with stable IDs (`cli-`, `srv-`, `dash-`, `pwa-`). Whenever you add, remove, rename, re-scope, or change the maturity of a feature (including flipping a `feature.*` flag's status in `src/config-settings.ts`/`src/features.ts`, or merging an in-flight branch), update the matching row: assign the next unused ID for its subsystem, place it per the production rule (production = merged to `main` AND not behind a `feature.*` flag; everything else is in-development), and keep the description factual and grounded in code with a manual-test link and source path. Descriptions must never claim behaviour that isn't implemented. Follow the "Maintaining this document" section in `docs/features.md`.
