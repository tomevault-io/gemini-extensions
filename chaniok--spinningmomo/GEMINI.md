## Project Overview

SpinningMomo (旋转吧大喵) is a Windows-only desktop tool for the game "Infinity Nikki" (无限暖暖), focused on photography, screenshots, recording, and related workflow tooling around the game window. The current repository is a native Win32 C++ application with an embedded web frontend, plus supporting docs, packaging, and playground tooling. The codebase is bilingual — code comments and UI strings are predominantly in Chinese.

## Build & Development

### Prerequisites
- Visual Studio 2022+ with Windows SDK 10.0.22621.0+
- xmake (primary build system)
- Node.js / npm (for web frontend and docs)
- .NET SDK 8.0+ and WiX v5+ when building installers locally

### Build Commands
```
# C++ backend — debug
xmake build

# C++ backend — release
xmake release

# Web frontend (in web/ directory)
cd web && npx vue-tsc -b
cd web && npm run build

# Full build: C++ release + web + assemble dist/
npm run build

# Packaging
npm run build:portable
npm run build:installer
```

### Web Frontend Dev Server
```
cd web && npm run dev
```
Vite dev server proxies `/rpc` and `/static` to the C++ backend at `localhost:51206`.

### Docs Dev Server
```
cd docs && npm run dev
```
`docs/` is a separate VitePress documentation site and is not part of the runtime app bundle.

## Architecture

### Two-Process Model
The application is a **native Win32 C++ backend** that hosts an embedded **WebView2** frontend. Communication happens over **JSON-RPC 2.0** through two transport layers:
- **WebView bridge** — used when the Vue app runs inside WebView2 (production)
- **HTTP + SSE** — used when the Vue app runs in a browser during development (uWebSockets on port 51206). SSE provides server-to-client push notifications.

The frontend auto-detects its environment (`window.chrome.webview` presence) and selects the appropriate transport.

### C++ Module System
The backend uses **C++23 modules** (`.ixx` interface files, `.cpp` implementation files). Module names follow a dotted hierarchy that mirrors the directory structure:

- `Core.*` — framework infrastructure (async runtime, database, events, HTTP client, HTTP server, RPC, WebView, i18n, commands, migration, worker pool, tasks, runtime info, shutdown, state)
- `Features.*` — business logic modules such as gallery, letterbox, notifications, overlay, preview, recording, screenshot, settings, update, and window_control
- `UI.*` — native Win32 UI (floating_window, tray_icon, context_menu, webview_window)
- `Utils.*` — shared utilities such as logger, file, graphics, image, media, path, string, system, throttle, timer, dialog, crash_dump, and crypto
- `Vendor.*` — thin wrappers re-exporting Win32 API and third-party types through the module system (e.g. `Vendor.Windows` wraps `<windows.h>`)

### Design Philosophy
The C++ backend does **NOT** use OOP class hierarchies. Instead it follows:
- **POD Structs + Free Functions**: plain data structs with free functions operating on them.
- **Centralized State**: all state lives in `AppState`, passed by reference.
- **Feature Independence**: features depend on `Core.*` but must NOT depend on each other.

### Central AppState
`Core::State::AppState` is the single root state object. It owns all subsystem states as `std::unique_ptr` members. Functions are free functions that accept `AppState&`.

### Key Patterns
- **Error handling**: `std::expected<T, std::string>` throughout; no exception-based control flow.
- **Async**: Asio-based coroutine runtime (`Core::Async`). RPC handlers return `asio::awaitable<RpcResult<T>>`.
- **Events**: Type-erased event bus (`Core::Events`) with sync `send()` and async `post()` (wakes the Win32 message loop via `PostMessageW`).
- **RPC registration**: `Core::RPC::register_method<Req, Res>()` auto-generates JSON Schema from C++ types via reflect-cpp. Field names are auto-converted between `snake_case` (C++) and `camelCase` (JSON).
- **Commands**: `Core::Commands` registry binds actions, toggle states, i18n keys, and optional hotkeys. Context menu and tray icon are driven by this registry.
- **Database**: SQLite via SQLiteCpp with thread-local connections, a `DataMapper` for ORM-like row mapping, and an auto-generated migration system (`scripts/generate-migrations.js`).
- **Vendor wrappers**: Win32 macros/functions are re-exported as proper C++ functions/constants in `Vendor::Windows` to stay compatible with the module system.
- **String encoding**: internal processing uses UTF-8 (`std::string`); Win32 API calls use UTF-16 (`std::wstring`). Convert via utilities in `Utils.String`.

### Web Frontend (web/)
The main frontend lives in `web/` and uses Vue 3 + TypeScript + Pinia + Tailwind CSS v4 + shadcn-vue/reka-ui. It is built with a Vite-compatible toolchain. Key directories:
- `web/src/core/rpc/` — JSON-RPC client with WebView and HTTP transports
- `web/src/core/i18n/` — client-side i18n
- `web/src/core/env/` — runtime environment detection
- `web/src/core/tasks/` — frontend task orchestration
- `web/src/features/` — feature modules (gallery, settings, home, about, map, onboarding, common, playground)
- `web/src/composables/` — shared composables (`useRpc`, `useI18n`, `useToast`)
- `web/src/extensions/` — game-specific integrations (infinity_nikki)
- `web/src/router/` — routes
- `web/src/types/` — shared TS types
- `web/src/lib/` — shared UI/helpers
- `web/src/assets/` — static assets

### Additional Repo Surfaces
- `docs/` — VitePress documentation site for user and developer docs
- `playground/` — standalone Node/TypeScript scripts for backend HTTP/RPC debugging and experiments
- `installer/` — WiX source files for MSI and bundle installer generation
- `tasks/` — custom xmake tasks such as `build-all`, `release`, and `vs`

### Gallery Module
`gallery` is one of the core vertical slices of the project. It is not just a page: it spans backend indexing/scanning/watchers/static file serving and frontend browsing/filtering/lightbox/detail workflows.

- **Backend entry points**:
  - `src/features/gallery/gallery.ixx/.cpp` is the orchestration layer for initialization, cleanup, scanning, thumbnail maintenance, file actions, and watcher registration.
  - `src/features/gallery/state.ixx` holds gallery runtime state such as thumbnail directory, asset path LRU cache, and per-root folder watcher state.
  - `src/features/gallery/scanner.*` handles full scans and index updates.
  - `src/features/gallery/watcher.*` restores folder watchers from DB, starts/stops them, and keeps the index in sync after startup.
  - `src/features/gallery/static_resolver.*` exposes thumbnails and original files to both HTTP dev mode and embedded WebView mode via `/static/assets/thumbnails/...` and `/static/assets/originals/<assetId>`.
- **Backend subdomains**:
  - `asset/` is the largest data domain and owns querying, timeline views, home stats, review state, descriptions, color extraction, thumbnails, and Infinity Nikki metadata access.
  - `folder/` owns folder tree persistence, display names, and root watch management.
  - `tag/` owns tag tree CRUD and asset-tag relations.
  - `ignore/` contains ignore-rule matching and persistence used by scans.
  - `color/` contains extracted main-color models and filtering support.
- **RPC shape**:
  - Gallery RPC is split by concern under `src/core/rpc/endpoints/gallery/`: `gallery.cpp` for scanning/maintenance, `asset.cpp` for asset queries and actions, `folder.cpp` for folder tree/navigation actions, and `tag.cpp` for tag management.
  - Frontend code should usually enter gallery through RPC methods prefixed with `gallery.*`.
  - Backend sends `gallery.changed` notifications after scan/index mutations; the frontend listens to this event and refreshes folder tree plus current asset view.
- **Startup behavior**:
  - During app initialization, the gallery module is initialized first, then watcher registrations are restored from DB, then Infinity Nikki photo-source registration runs, and finally all registered gallery watchers are started near the end of startup.
- **Frontend entry points**:
  - `web/src/features/gallery/api.ts` is the RPC facade and static URL helper layer.
- `web/src/features/gallery/store/index.ts` is the single source of truth for gallery UI state. Store internals are split into `store/querySlice.ts`, `store/navigationSlice.ts`, `store/interactionSlice.ts`, and shared helpers in `store/persistence.ts`.
  - `web/src/features/gallery/composables/` coordinates behavior around data loading, selection, layout, sidebar, lightbox, virtualized grids, and asset actions.
  - `web/src/features/gallery/pages/GalleryPage.vue` hosts the three-pane shell (sidebar, viewer, details); child views live under `web/src/features/gallery/components/` in subfolders: `shell/` (sidebar, viewer, details, toolbar, content), `viewer/` (grid/list/masonry/adaptive), `asset/`, `tags/`, `folders/`, `dialogs/`, `menus/`, `infinity_nikki/`, and `lightbox/`.
  - `web/src/features/gallery/routes.ts` defines the `/gallery` route; `web/src/router/index.ts` spreads it so there is a single source of truth for path, name (`gallery`), and meta.
- **Frontend data flow**:
  - Prefer the existing pattern `component -> composable -> api -> RPC` and let components read state directly from the Pinia store.
  - `useGalleryData()` loads data and writes into store state.
  - `useGallerySelection()` and `useGalleryAssetActions()` implement higher-level UI behaviors on top of the store instead of duplicating state in components.
- When changing filters/sort/view mode, check `store/index.ts` plus related slices under `store/` and `queryFilters.ts`; when changing visible behavior, check the relevant composable before editing large Vue components.
- **Domain model summary**:
  - The gallery centers on `Asset`, `FolderTreeNode`, `TagTreeNode`, scan/task progress, and flexible `QueryAssetsFilters`.
  - The same conceptual model exists on both sides: C++ types in `src/features/gallery/types.ixx`, mirrored by TS types in `web/src/features/gallery/types.ts`.
  - Infinity Nikki-specific enrichments such as photo params and map points are exposed as part of gallery asset queries rather than as a completely separate frontend feature.

### RPC Endpoint Organization
Endpoints live under `src/core/rpc/endpoints/<domain>/`, each domain exposes a `register_all(state)` called from `registry.cpp`. Current domains include file, clipboard, dialog, runtime_info, settings, tasks, update, webview, gallery, extensions, registry, and window_control. Game-specific adapters in `src/extensions/` (currently `infinity_nikki`) are exposed via `rpc/endpoints/extensions/`.

### Initialization Order
Initialization still follows the top-level chain `main.cpp` → `Application::Initialize()` → `Core::Initializer::initialize_application()`. In practice this sets up core infrastructure first (events, async/runtime, worker pool, RPC, HTTP, database, settings, update, commands), then native UI surfaces, then feature services such as recording and gallery, then the Infinity Nikki extension, onboarding gate, hotkeys, and startup update checks.

## Build Output
- Release: `build\windows\x64\release\`
- Debug: `build\windows\x64\debug\`
- Distribution: `dist/` (exe + web resources)

## Installer
Installers are built via `scripts/build-msi.ps1`. The script builds an MSI package and, by default, a WiX bundle-based setup `.exe`, both under `dist/`.

## Code Generation Scripts
These must be re-run when their source files change:
- `node scripts/generate-migrations.js` — after modifying `src/migrations/*.sql`
- `node scripts/generate-embedded-locales.js` — after modifying `src/locales/*.json` (zh-CN / en-US)
- `node scripts/generate-map-injection-cpp.js` — after modifying `web/src/features/map/injection/source/*.js` (regenerates minified JS and C++ map injection module)

## Naming Conventions
- **C++ module names**: PascalCase with dots — `Features.Gallery`, `Core.RPC.Types`
- **C++ files/functions**: snake_case — `gallery.ixx`, `initialize()`
- **No anonymous namespaces**: Do not use `namespace { ... }` in C++; put helpers in the module's named namespace.
- **Frontend components**: PascalCase — `GalleryPage.vue`
- **Frontend modules**: camelCase — `galleryApi.ts`
- **Module import order** in `.ixx`: `std` → `Vendor.*` → `Core.*` → `Features.*` / `UI.*` / `Utils.*`

## Testing
No automated test suite. Manual testing only:
1. Build and run the exe.
2. Use the `web/src/features/playground/` pages for interactive RPC endpoint testing during development.
3. Use the root-level `playground/` scripts for backend HTTP/RPC debugging and ad-hoc experiments.

## Adding a New Feature
1. Create a directory under `src/features/<name>/` with at minimum a `.ixx` module interface and `.cpp` implementation.
2. Add a state struct in `<name>/state.ixx` and register it in `Core::State::AppState`.
3. Add RPC endpoint file under `src/core/rpc/endpoints/<name>/`, implement `register_all(state)`, and wire it in `registry.cpp`.
4. Register commands in `src/core/commands/builtin.cpp` if the feature needs hotkeys/menu entries.
5. If the feature needs initialization, add it to `Core::Initializer::initialize_application`.
6. On the web side, add a feature directory under `web/src/features/<name>/` with `api.ts`, `store/index.ts`, `types.ts`, components, and pages.
