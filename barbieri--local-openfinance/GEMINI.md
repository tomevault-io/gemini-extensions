# AGENTS.md - local-openfinance

This file is the canonical guide for humans and coding agents working in this
repository. Keep it accurate, but keep product and technical specifications in
`specs/` instead of growing this file.

## User setup (Grok, OpenClaw, and other agents)

If the human asked you to install, configure, first-run, or "make this work"
on their machine, stop reading this contributor guide and follow
`.agents/skills/setup/SKILL.md`. That skill installs the localhost web UI and
the Linux systemd or macOS launchd jobs that keep it serving and syncing.

This file is for people changing the code.

## Self-update protocol (required)

When you learn something durable about this project, update the relevant
documentation in the same change before finishing the task.

- If the new detail is agent guidance, workflow, conventions, tooling,
  operational steps, or a rule for how contributors should work, update this
  file.
- If the new detail is product behavior, UI behavior, API behavior, data shape,
  SQL schema behavior, command behavior, validation rules, or application
  architecture, update the best matching file under `specs/`.
- If no matching spec exists, create one and link it from `specs/README.md`.
- Do not duplicate existing guidance. Revise or remove stale bullets when
  behavior changes.

Before finishing any task that touches config, including schema, loader,
`config.example.json`, or config behavior, check that `README.md` documents
every field and constraint in `schemas/config.schema.json`. Update `README.md`
in the same change if it is missing or stale. Treat the schema as canonical.

## Project overview

`local-openfinance` uses the Banco MCP REST API to synchronize Brazilian
OpenFinance data locally into SQLite. It annotates and labels entries for cost
segmentation and reporting.

Annotation can use embeddings and classifiers, including local models through
Ollama. Reporting and other LLM features use Vercel AI SDK model APIs.

Implementation roadmap: `PLAN.md`.

## Tooling

- Use `nvm use` before running project commands. `.nvmrc` pins the required
  Node version, currently 26+ for built-in `node:sqlite`.
- SQLite uses `import { DatabaseSync } from 'node:sqlite'`; do not add
  `better-sqlite3` or another DB npm dependency.
- TypeScript extends `@tsconfig/strictest` with `"types": ["node"]`.
- pnpm v11 is the package manager. `packageManager` pins the Corepack version.
- `pnpm-workspace.yaml` allows the `esbuild` postinstall needed by the CLI
  bundle step.
- Biome handles formatting and linting. TypeScript and JavaScript use single
  quotes.
- Vitest is the test runner.
- Pino is used for structured trace logs.
- yargs handles CLI command and option parsing.
- `@inquirer/prompts` powers interactive CLI flows.
- `chalk` and `marked-terminal` format terminal output and markdown reports.

## Formatting and QA (required)

- TypeScript and JavaScript use single quotes. JSON files keep standard double
  quotes.
- Every commit requires a passing `pnpm run qa`. Run `nvm use`, then `pnpm run
  qa` before handing work back and before committing.
- `pnpm run qa` runs check, build, test, typecheck, and React Doctor in
  parallel.
- Use `pnpm run check:fix` for Biome formatting and safe lint fixes, then rerun
  `pnpm run qa`.
- `.husky/pre-commit` enforces `pnpm run qa`. Never disable, bypass, or weaken
  this hook, and do not commit with failing QA.
- GitHub Actions `.github/workflows/qa.yml` runs the same `pnpm run qa` on
  `master`/`main` and pull requests. It must not load a personal `.env` or call
  model providers.
- React Doctor is configured by `doctor.config.json`. It is part of `pnpm run
  qa` and **blocks on warnings**. The `deslop/unused-dev-dependency` rule is
  off for CLI-only dev dependencies such as `pino-pretty`.
  `auth-token-in-web-storage` is off because the localhost token is stored in
  `sessionStorage` on purpose.
- Subscribe to `window.location.hash` with `useSyncExternalStore`, not
  `useState` plus a `hashchange` `useEffect`.
- Destructure `useQuery()` results (`data`, `isLoading`). Do not assign the
  whole query object.
- Combine `.filter().map()` into one pass in files React Doctor scans.

## Task routing and real-data evaluation

- Unless the user explicitly opts out, use the project-local Poteto Mode
  workflow (`.agents/skills/poteto-mode/SKILL.md`) through pstack for work that
  is not clearly simple. It selects the applicable best-practice playbook and
  any needed subagent work.
- Treat documentation-only changes, visual HTML/CSS adjustments, and simpler
  or trivial code as simple tasks. New specifications, architecture, modules,
  or changes that touch more than five files are not simple tasks.
- When a user asks to check with real data, reading the available configuration
  and database and sending that data to the configured model provider is
  authorized and expected. This includes gitignored and `tmp/` artifacts, or
  paths explicitly supplied by the user. Do not ask separately for permission.

## Data safety

- Never destroy user data. Before an operation that may be destructive,
  including database migrations or SQL `DELETE`, `UPDATE`, `DROP`, or `ALTER`,
  make a full timestamped copy named with the change slug, such as
  `20260826T123456-before-recreate-report-memory`.
- Apply the same backup rule to configuration and every other changed artifact
  that is not already tracked by Git.

## Code conventions

- The package is ESM (`"type": "module"`).
- TypeScript imports use `.js` extensions.
- Use `readString` and `readFieldString` for string fields that should trim
  whitespace and convert blanks to `null`.
- Add new scoring and analysis providers in `src/providers.ts`.
- Persist identifiers and display names:
  - UI pickers may display human-readable names and paths.
  - APIs, assist proposals, and SQLite writes should use stable ids.
  - Resolve legacy name/path references only when reading old stored proposals.
- SQLite write helpers in `src/db/sqlite-query.ts` log failed statements and
  return user-facing constraint messages through web API `{ error }` payloads.
- Use cached dynamic `Intl` helpers from `src/utils/intl-formatters.ts`.
- Hoist static formatters at module scope or use `useMemo` in React when locale
  and options are stable per render.
- For independent async work over many items, use `mapInParallel` from
  `src/utils/map-in-parallel.ts` or `Promise.all` for small batches without
  shared mutable state.
- Prefer `.toSorted()` when you need a sorted copy and the source array is still
  referenced elsewhere.
- When you already allocated a throwaway array, such as `[...map.entries()]`,
  sort that copy in place instead of chaining `.toSorted()`.
- Minimize change scope and match existing Biome-formatted style.
- Do not commit secrets, `tmp/`, or browser profile data.
- Code and documentation should not use absolute paths to project files. Use
  project-relative paths.

## Example topic configs

`examples/expenses-config.json` and `examples/expenses-minimal-config.json`
must stay behaviorally identical.

- The full file lists every loader-defaulted field at its default value so
  readers can see what would be used and copy a starting point for custom
  configs.
- The minimal file omits every field that has a loader default.
- Specified fields (required fields, and any non-default choice) must match
  in both files.
- Do not put empty `sync.connections` or `report.accountIds` arrays in the
  full example; the schema forbids `minItems: 1` empty lists, and omitting
  them is the default (“all”).
- `tests/config.test.ts` asserts the resolved configs are equal and that
  defaulted leaves are present only in the full file.

Bundled analysis instructions live in `src/llm/prompts/` and are referenced
via `@DEFAULT_BASE_INSTRUCTIONS@`. The CLI bundle copies those files to
`dist/bundle/prompts/` (runtime `readFileSync`, not inlined). Topic overlays
live beside the example config (`examples/expenses/`). Named-report prompts
belong in `reports[].prompts`; singular `report` contains shared filters only.
When you change default prompt text, edit the markdown files, not TypeScript
string literals.

## Web UI implementation guidance

- Web implementation lives in `src/web/`.
- The stack is Vite, React, and Hono.
- Dev command: `pnpm run dev:web`.
- Production path: `pnpm run build`, then `serve --config ...`.
- Tab pages are lazy-loaded in `src/web/client/App.tsx` with `React.lazy` and
  `Suspense`.
- Web API route modules live under `src/web/server/`.
- Transaction list, chart, and search routes share
  `parseTransactionFiltersFromRequest()` in `src/web/server/transaction-request.ts`.
- Mockups live in `docs/web-mockups/index.html`.
- For React form/dialog state, when several scalar values are reset together,
  store them in one object state with readonly fields and update through one
  setter.
- Prefer render-time sync from props/keys over `useEffect` for prop-to-state
  alignment.
- When resyncing derived fields after reference data loads, overwrite only
  fields the user has not customized.
- Keep separate `useState` calls when fields are independent.

## CLI implementation guidance

Register only durable, user-facing subcommands in `src/local-openfinance.ts`.
Use one file per command under `src/commands/`.

Do not add CLI commands for one-off development data fixes, local-state
migrations, or bugs that will not recur after the root cause is fixed. Use
ad-hoc `sqlite3` or a temporary script under `scripts/` during development, then
delete the script when done.

Command behavior is specified in `specs/cli-commands.md`.

`maintain` is the durable daily backup + sync entrypoint. It writes a dated
`VACUUM INTO` copy, prunes backups older than 30 local days, then syncs and
precomputes missing classify suggestions. `--serve` starts the web UI after
backup/prune, then starts the same background sync job as the Sync tab so the
server is listening during the long sync. Example user systemd units live in
`examples/systemd/`.

## Commit series for review

Each slice in a to-be-submitted series should be **one commit** with the
finished behavior of that slice.

When QA or an independent review finds bugs in a slice already committed on
the branch, do **not** leave a follow-up `fix:` commit in the published
history. Record a fixup and fold it into the original slice before the branch
is handed over:

```sh
git commit --fixup=<slice-commit>
git rebase --autosquash <series-base>
```

`<series-base>` is the commit the PR starts from (the parent of the first PR
commit). Example: for a series that starts after `39cbe18`, rebase onto that
commit.

Do not publish `feat:` then `fix:` for the same slice. Reviewers should see
the corrected slice, not the mistake and the patch.

Before considering a change set done or opening its PR, run the project-local
Thermos review workflow (`.agents/skills/thermos/SKILL.md`) for combined
correctness, security, and code-quality review. Then use the project-local Make
PR Easy to Review workflow (`.agents/skills/make-pr-easy-to-review/SKILL.md`) to
prepare the history and reviewer guidance. Do not leave a commit that introduces
behavior later fixed within the same change set; fold that correction into the
introducing commit. Keep distinct follow-up improvements as separate commits
when they are not corrections to the original behavior.

## Multi-slice agent work

For a large feature split into slices (see `specs/intelligence.md`):

- Implement **one slice at a time**. Do not run parallel worktrees or
  parallel implementers on this repo unless the user asks; it burns tokens
  and collides on shared files (`App.tsx`, hash routing, migrations).
- After the slice is committed, run a **fresh** review subagent that does
  **not** resume the implementer and does **not** receive implementer
  notes. Give it the user request, the plan, the slice id, and `git show`.
- If implementer and reviewer disagree, launch a **tie-break** subagent
  (no loyalty to either). Treat its verdict as the gate for the next slice.
- Fold review fixes with `--fixup` as above before starting the next slice
  when practical, and always before the series is submitted.

## Intelligence

Product behavior and completed slice history: `specs/intelligence.md`.

- `#/transaction/<id>` (singular) is a permalink, not a header tab.
- Reports is one header tab. `#/reports` lists configured reports;
  `#/reports/<id>` is that report’s current page. Chat and Memory nest
  under the report id. See `specs/intelligence.md`.
- Briefing and prompts must not hardcode place names (no Ubatuba).
- Email is `run --send` with nodemailer CID PNGs. Due jobs use `run --due`.
  Do not use run-and-notify as the success path (no attachments).
- Live eval on `examples/tmp/openfinance.sqlite` (follow a symlink) with
  the configured LLM is **authorized**. Do not commit the database, `.env`,
  or SMTP passwords.
- The named-report slice series is complete; no report coding slice remains.
