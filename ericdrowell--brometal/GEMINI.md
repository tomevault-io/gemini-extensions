# BroMetal — notes for coding agents

You are writing an app that uses BroMetal. This file is the whole orientation:
what it is, the rules the DSL enforces, and the mistakes that fail *silently*.

BroMetal compiles shaders written in a typed TypeScript DSL into WGSL **at build
time**, and ships a WebGPU runtime behind one API. There is no scene graph, no
material system, and no shader compiler in the browser. You write the shader.

---

## The loop

1. Write `src/shaders/thing.shader.ts` — `export const Thing = shader({...})`.
   Name it explicitly; `--js13k` requires the name and uses it as the global.
2. Run `npx brometal dev` (watch) or `npx brometal prod` (one-shot, optimized).
   This writes `thing.shader.gen.ts` next to it.
3. Import the **`.gen`** module in your app, never the `.shader.ts` source.

**If you edit a `.shader.ts` you must recompile before the change has any
effect.** Nothing at runtime reads the source. A common failure is editing a
shader, reloading, and concluding the change did nothing.

```ts
import { createRenderer, createProgram, createCamera, createCube } from 'brometal';
import cubeShader from './shaders/cube.shader.gen';

const renderer = await createRenderer(canvas);      // WebGPU; throws where unavailable
const program = createProgram(renderer, cubeShader);
const cube = createCube({ width: 1, height: 1, depth: 1 });

program.attributes.aPosition.set(cube.positions);
program.setIndices(cube.indices);

renderer.loop((t) => {
  program.uniforms.uViewProj.set(camera.viewProjection(renderer.aspect));
  program.draw();
});
```

## Rules the DSL enforces

These are compile errors with `file:line:col`. Read the message; it names the fix.

- **One `return`**, as the final top-level statement of `vertex` / `fragment`.
  No early returns, no returns inside `if`.
- `vertex` returns a `vec4` clip position. `fragment` returns a `vec4` colour.
- `vertex` must assign **every** declared varying.
- **No arrays, no structs.** Loop over a texture instead.
- `for` loops need a float counter: `for (let i = 0; i < n; i += 1)`.
- `if` / `else if` / `else` are fine. No `while`, no `switch`, no `break`.
- Uniform types: `float vec2 vec3 vec4 mat4 sampler2D`. Attributes and varyings
  cannot be `mat4` or `sampler2D`.
- Helper functions must be **module-level** `function` declarations with typed
  params, declared **above first use**. Params may be
  `number, Vec2, Vec3, Vec4, Mat4, Sampler2D`.

### Float-only vs vector intrinsics

This one bites constantly. These take **float arguments only** — passing a
vector is a compile error:

```
sin  cos  tan  asin  acos  atan  abs  sign  fract  floor  sqrt  exp  exp2  log
pow  min  max  mod  step  smoothstep
```

These take vectors and **return a float**: `length(v)`, `dot(a, b)`,
`distance(a, b)`.

These take vectors and return vectors: `normalize`, `cross`, `reflect`,
`texture`, `targetUv`, and the `vec2/vec3/vec4` constructors. `mix(a, b, t)`
takes float-or-vector `a`/`b` with a float `t`; `clamp(x, min, max)` takes a
float-or-vector `x` with float bounds.

For a component-wise `max` on a vector, do it per component:
`vec3(max(v.x, 0), max(v.y, 0), max(v.z, 0))`.

### Vector maths is method calls, not operators

`a.add(b) a.sub(b) a.mul(b) a.div(b) a.scale(k)`, and `m.mul(v)` for a `mat4`.
`a + b` on two vectors will not compile. Swizzles read normally: `v.xyz`, `v.x`.

### Unary minus on a vector

Write `0 - x` rather than `-x` when negating an expression you are unsure about;
`vec3(0,1,0).scale(0 - 1)` is the reliable form.

## Failures that are silent — read this before debugging a black screen

**Reserved words.** WGSL reserves a long list of ordinary-looking words for
future use, and several are names you would reach for without thinking:
`type set get from new use with where match self null pass target filter
precise shared mod`. BroMetal rejects them at build time, so this shows up as a
name error rather than a black screen — but that is why.

**`texture()` cannot be called inside an `if`.** WGSL requires texture sampling
to happen in uniform control flow. Sampling inside a conditional invalidates the
*whole pipeline* — the pass silently draws nothing, and you get a black screen
with no console error. Sample unconditionally and multiply the result away:

```ts
const contribution = texture(uMap, uv).x * step(0.5, someCondition);
```

(Inside a **helper function** the emitter uses `textureSampleLevel`, which does
not carry that restriction — but it always samples LOD 0, so no mipmapping.)

**Sampling a render target needs `targetUv`.** NDC +y lands on a target's *first*
row while texture v runs top-down, so hand-rolling `clip.xy / clip.w * 0.5 + 0.5`
reads the target **vertically mirrored**. A mirrored lookup still produces a
plausible-looking image, so this reads as a lighting bug rather than a coordinate
one.

```ts
const uv = targetUv(lightClipPosition);
```

**The canvas has no `width`/`height` attributes.** BroMetal owns the drawing
buffer and tracks the CSS box at the device pixel ratio. Size it with CSS, and
give the *container* a definite size. Setting the attributes plants an intrinsic
minimum size that overflows flex containers.

---

## Shadows

Use the library functions. They exist because both of the bugs above bit hard
when this was written by hand.

```ts
// Depth pass — render occluders from the light into a target.
v.vDistance = shadowDepth(worldPos, uLightPos, uRange);

// Lit pass — 3x3 PCF, slope-scaled bias, correct per-backend uv.
const lit = shadowFactor(
  uShadowMap, uLightViewProj, worldPos, normal, uLightPos,
  uRange, uTexel, uSoftness, uBias,
);
```

Two things the CPU side must get right:

```ts
// depth: true, or the map records the LAST surface drawn, not the NEAREST.
const map = createRenderTarget(renderer, { width: 1024, height: 1024, depth: true });

// clear to 1, or every texel the light never drew claims an occluder sitting
// AT the light and the whole scene renders in shadow.
renderer.drawTo(map, () => depthProgram.draw(), { clear: [1, 1, 1, 1] });
```

`uBias` is in **world units** (try `0.05`). `uTexel` is `1 / mapSize`.

---

## GPU state and simulation

`createRenderTarget` + `renderer.drawTo` give the GPU memory between frames.
Targets are RGBA16F, sampled unfiltered.

One trap: **texture V runs opposite ways on the two backends.** A fullscreen
quad written into a target covers its rows bottom-to-top on one and top-to-bottom
on the other, so a state layout split across *rows* reads back transposed. Split
along **X** instead, which agrees on both.

---

## API surface

**Runtime:** `createRenderer createProgram createRenderTarget createCamera
createTexture createStorageBuffer loadTexture loadGlb parseGlb mat4`. Storage
buffers accept `Float32Array`, `Uint32Array`, and `Int32Array`. A program can
submit GPU-authored commands with `dispatchIndirect(buffer)` and
`drawIndirect(buffer)`.

**Geometry:** `createCube createPlane createSphere createCylinder createCone
createTorus createTorusKnot createCircle createRing createTeapot`

**DSL intrinsics:** `vec2 vec3 vec4 texture targetUv normalize length distance
dot cross mix clamp reflect sin cos tan asin acos atan abs sign fract floor sqrt
pow exp exp2 log mod step smoothstep min max atomicLoad atomicAdd atomicMax
atomicExchange uint bitAnd bitOr bitXor shiftLeft shiftRight instanceId vertexId`

**`brometal/shaders`** — 30 precompiled fullscreen effects (fire, caustics,
raymarching, CRT/glitch image effects). Zero compilation in your app.

**`brometal/shader-functions`** — inlined into shader text at build time, so
unused ones cost nothing. Prefer composing these over deriving the maths:

- *noise* `hash11 hash21 hash22 hash31 vnoise2 vnoise3 gnoise2 fbm2 fbm3 gfbm2
  turbulence2 warp2 voronoi2 worleyEdge2 curl2`
- *lighting* `lambert blinnPhongSpec specGGX fresnel hemisphereLight toonShade`
- *colour* `luminance rgb2hsv hsv2rgb cosinePalette adjustSaturation
  brightnessContrast blendScreen blendOverlay blendOverlayChannel tonemapACES
  tonemapReinhard gammaCorrect filmGrain`
- *shadows* `shadowDepth shadowFactor`
- *physics* `integrateVelocity integratePosition verletStep applyDrag
  bounceVelocity applyFriction restingDamp boxContactNormal clampInsideBox
  spherePenetration separateSpheres collisionImpulse`
- *sdf* `sdCircle sdBox2 sdRoundedBox2 sdHexagon sdSegment2 sdSphere3 sdBox3
  sdTorus3 sdCapsule3 sdOctahedron3 sdPlane3 smoothUnion smoothSubtract
  smoothIntersect fillAA strokeAA`
- *easing* `easeInQuad easeOutQuad easeInOutQuad easeInCubic easeOutCubic
  easeInOutCubic easeInOutSine easeOutExpo easeOutBack easeOutElastic
  easeOutBounce`
- *misc* `remap smootherstep rotate2 rotate3 gerstnerWave`

`applyFriction(vel, normal, normalImpulse, friction)` takes the normal impulse —
pass the length of the velocity change `bounceVelocity` produced. Without that
bound it damps the entire tangential plane, which for a vertical surface
includes the *downward* axis, and bodies hang on walls.

## Verifying your work

The compiler catches syntax and signatures. It does **not** catch wrong units,
wrong physics, or a reflection sampling the wrong surface — and those are the
bugs that actually cost time. They are invisible to types and visible only on
screen. Render the thing and look at it before declaring it done.
