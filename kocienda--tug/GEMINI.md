# Claude Code Guidelines for Tugtool

## Project Overview

Tugtool is a developer tool suite. Its centerpiece is the **Session card** — a graphical surface where shell commands and AI interactions coexist in one UI, replacing the terminal. The suite includes tugcast (WebSocket multiplexer), tugcode (Claude Code bridge), tug (the unified developer CLI — changes & commits, dashes, host plumbing), tugdeck (browser frontend), tugplug (agentless skills), and Tug.app (macOS host).

## Git Policy

**ONLY THE USER CAN COMMIT TO GIT.** Do not run `git commit`, `git push`, or any git commands that modify the repository history unless explicitly instructed by the user. You may run read-only git commands like `git status`, `git diff`, `git log`, etc.

**Exceptions:**
- Autonomous implementation: when the user explicitly authorizes autonomous sub-step execution (e.g., "go on your own"), commit after each sub-step using the `/tugplug:draft` skill's message style. Report each commit hash and message.
- The `dash` and `dash-implement` skills commit on their **dash worktree** (never on `main`) via `tugutil dash commit`, as part of running a recipe / dash. `main` is only updated by the user's landing gestures.

The `/tugplug:draft` skill **never commits** — it authors the session's landing draft via `tugutil draft set`. Landing is the user's act: `/commit` (main lane) and `/dash-join <name>` (dash lane) in the Session card are the landing gestures.

## Writing prose the Session card renders

**Backtick every file path you write, every time.** Your transcript prose is rendered markdown, and a path in backticks and the same path bare are one reference wearing two faces — the reader has to work out that the difference means nothing. Backticks are the author's own emphasis and the renderer may not invent them, so consistency is yours to supply. The same goes for commands and symbols. A commit sha is the one thing you write **bare** in backticks — `` `63de5762a` ``, never `commit 63de5762a` — because the app supplies the word and displays it as `commit:63de5762a`.

Clickability is not what backticks are for: the resolver confirms a path and rules it whether or not you formatted it as code. This is about the sentence reading as one voice. The doctrine is [tuglaws/entity-presentation.md](tuglaws/entity-presentation.md#the-house-voices-backtick-every-path).

## The standalone contract

Tug is distributed as `Tug.app` to people whose projects have nothing to do with this checkout: no `tuglaws/`, no `justfile`, no `CLAUDE.md` of ours, no `~/.local/bin` symlinks, possibly no `jq` or `bun`. Everything the AI needs to drive Tug on such a project must be inside the bundle — the binaries in `Contents/MacOS/` and the plugin at `Contents/Resources/tugplug/`. The contract and its guards are in [tugplug/CLAUDE.md](tugplug/CLAUDE.md#the-standalone-contract): `just tugplug-lint` (in `just lint`) refuses checkout-only shapes under `tugplug/`, and `just test-standalone` (in `just test`) drives the real hook script and dash verbs from a scratch project with an empty PATH. Anything Tugtool-specific a skill would like to say — which recipe builds, which tests are green — belongs in `.tugtool/config.toml` or in this file, never in the plugin.

## Repository Structure

| Directory | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `tugrust/` | Rust crates (tugcast, tug, tugexec, tugbank, tugcore, the `*-core` libraries — tugutil-core/tugdash-core/tugchanges-core — and supporting libraries) |
| `tugproto/` | Shared protocol / message types (TypeScript) |
| `tugcode/` | Claude Code bridge (stream-json IPC); bun-compiled binary |
| `tugdeck/` | Web frontend (the Session card lives here) |
| `tugapp/` | Swift macOS app (Tug.app host) |
| `tugplug/` | Claude Code plugin (agentless skills: dash/dash-plan/dash-devise/dash-review/dash-implement/dash-audit/draft/tripwire). A dash's documents live at `.tug/dashes/<name>/` and are never tracked. |
| `tuglaws/` | Architecture laws + design decisions — the curated durable doc surface |
| `tests/` | App-test harness that drives the real Tug.app |

## Build Policy

**WARNINGS ARE ERRORS.** The Rust workspace enforces `-D warnings` via `tugrust/.cargo/config.toml`.

- `cargo build` will fail if there are any warnings
- `cargo nextest run` will fail if tests have any warnings
- Fix warnings immediately; do not leave them for later

## Testing

Run Rust tests with:
```bash
cd tugrust && cargo nextest run
```

### App-tests: run a selection, never a sweep

Every app-test launches its own `Tug.app` subprocess and the whole invocation is serialized behind a machine-wide gate, so running the corpus is expensive. **Selective runs are the default.**

```bash
just app-test-changed        # the everyday command — derived from your working diff
just app-test-select         # print that selection without running it
```

Selection is derived, not guessed: every `*.test.ts` declares the source it exercises with `@covers` lines in its header docblock, and `app-test-changed` resolves the changed files through those declarations. Any new test **must** carry `@covers` — `just app-test-covers-check` fails on a missing declaration or a path that no longer resolves.

The changed files are **this session's**, not the whole tree's. The selector reads `tugutil changes --json` and selects from the attributed bucket plus any unattributed entry carrying a this-session hint; the **foreign** bucket — files another live session claims — is never selected, so a shared checkout no longer hands you tests for work that isn't yours. When the ledger can't answer (no `TUG_SESSION_ID`, unresolvable session, no built `tugutil`), selection falls back to the whole working tree and prints which fallback it took and why.

Do **not** run `just app-test-all` on your own initiative. Run the full corpus only when:

- the user explicitly asks for it, or
- you changed something that runs before any test's first assertion (`tests/app-test/_harness/`, `tugapp/Sources/TestHarness/`, `tugdeck/src/main.tsx`, `tugdeck/index.html`) — no `@covers` line can scope those, so `app-test-changed` prints a **CORE TIER ADVISED** advisory. The answer to that advisory is the ~20-file core tier (`just app-test`), not the full corpus. Run it and move on; it is not a question for the user.

Bare `just app-test` (no arguments) is a curated **core tier** of ~20 tests — one per load-bearing surface — for a fast read on whether the app fundamentally works. It is deliberately not everything. `just app-test <files…>` runs exactly what you name.

### The output is the report

The recipe prints a finished report: a per-file result table, a `Diagnostics:` section carrying every `note()` the tests asked to be seen, a `Failures:` section giving each failure's message and its location in the test file, and a closing `VERDICT:` line. Per-file `bun` streams are suppressed by default (`TUG_APPTEST_STREAM=1` restores them verbatim), so a green one-file run is about twenty lines. There is nothing a filter can extract that the summary has not already extracted.

If you do filter it, know what the filter costs: the pipeline's exit status becomes the filter's, so `just app-test X | grep -A 8 "Failures:"` on a **passing** run prints nothing and exits 1 — a green run that reads as a silent failure. A fixed `-A N` window also truncates the second failure and drops `Diagnostics:` entirely. Reading the report bare is simpler than working around either.

Want a result to compute over rather than read? `TUG_APPTEST_JSON=<path>` writes a document — verdict, totals, per-file status, failures, notes — serialized from the same arrays the text summary renders, so the two cannot drift. It never touches stdout.

The doctrine is in [tuglaws/app-test-harness.md](tuglaws/app-test-harness.md#selection-is-derived-not-remembered); the how-to is in [tests/app-test/README.md](tests/app-test/README.md#choosing-what-to-run).

## Ledger databases — never open live files with sqlite3

Never point the `sqlite3` CLI (or any non-Tug SQLite build) at the live databases under `~/Library/Application Support/Tug/` — a foreign SQLite participating in WAL recovery/checkpointing on a live ledger is a corruption vector (the 2026-07-27 incident). Use `just db-inspect <name|path> ["SQL"]`, which copies the db + WAL/shm to a temp dir and inspects the copy. In Rust, every writable ledger open goes through `tugcore::ledger_db` (enforced by the `no_ad_hoc_ledger_opens` test); shared `changes.db` schema changes require bumping `CHANGES_SCHEMA_VERSION` with a registered migration — never edit the DDL alone.

`apptest_results.db` is the machine-global record of every app-test run — one row per run, one per file in it — keyed by the **resolved base checkout**, so a dash worktree and the checkout it forked from share one history. It exists to answer one question cheaply: every red file in a `Failures:` section arrives with a `history:` line saying whether it was green before you touched it, when it last was, or that it has been red for the last N recorded runs. The same object rides `TUG_APPTEST_JSON`. Write and read it only through `tugutil apptest record|history` (`just db-inspect apptest_results "SELECT …"` to look); recording is telemetry that never gates a run, and retention is the most recent 500 runs per checkout, pruned at record time. `TUG_APPTEST_RESULTS_DB` redirects it for test isolation.

`prompt_history.db` is the machine-global, append-only record of every prompt the user has submitted — shared top-level like `changes.db`, deliberately not per-instance, because the corpus belongs to the user rather than to an instance. Inspect it the same way (`just db-inspect prompt_history "SELECT …"`). It is the one ledger with no retention policy at all: nothing trims it, and any change that would drop, cap, or expire a row is a bug in the feature, not a tuning knob. Its schema is gated on `PRAGMA user_version` with a registered migration list in `prompt_ledger.rs` — the same regime as the other shared ledgers.

## Editing repo files from the shell

`Edit`/`MultiEdit`/`Write` name their file in the tool input, so the change is attributed with certainty, and for a single-file edit they stay the first choice. This section is about the residue — the edit that does not fit them, and reaches for the shell instead.

A shell command is only attributed when the grammar in `tugchanges-core::shell_ops` can read which files it names — and **a `python3` heredoc that writes a repo file cannot be read at all.** Heredoc bodies are stripped before parsing (a body is data, not commands), so nothing inside one is evidence of anything. Same for `python3 -c`, `perl -e`, `bun -e`. **The PreToolUse gate now denies those**: an interpreter handed its program inline whose text carries both a write-shaped call and a repo path is refused, and the refusal shows you the edit program to write instead. A heredoc that only reads, or that writes under `/tmp` or `target/`, passes untouched.

So write the multi-line edit as an **edit program** — a small program `tugutil` executes itself, which prints the same `TUG-FILE-RECEIPT` an `Edit` would have earned:

```bash
tugutil file edit <<'EDIT'
file tugdeck/src/deck-manager.ts
  replace "  // The strip's own stop, one past the picture's." with "  // One stop for the whole strip."
  patch <<
     return (
-      this.container.clientHeight -
-      IMPOSITION_GAP_PX -
-      IMPOSITION_GAP_BOTTOM_PX
+      this.container.clientHeight - IMPOSITION_GAP_PX - impositionGapBottomPx()
     );
>>
  delete 166 .. 178
files tugdeck/src/lib/pulse-store.ts tugdeck/src/lib/local-model-store.ts
  sub /\bpulse_(\w+)/ 'local_model_$1' all
EDIT
```

Three rules carry nearly every refusal an edit program has ever earned. **A body is the file's bytes, verbatim** — indent every line exactly as the file does, keeping the structure *inside* the block, never squared off under the op line; it is the same thing an `Edit`'s `old_string` is. **A block that replaces a block is a `patch` hunk** — one prefix byte per line (` ` context, `-` out, `+` in) and the file's own indentation after it, which is how the indentation stays visible instead of being reconstructed. **A literal that contains `'` goes in `"…"`** — never `'"'"'` or `'\''`, which are the shell's idiom, and an edit-program literal is not a shell string.

A `<<` body is also an **address**, wherever an address goes — so `after << … >> insert << … >>` anchors past a whole block when no single line in it is worth naming, and beats a line number, which goes stale the moment anything above it moves. `before` takes the block's first line, `after` its last.

Every address resolves against the file's **original** bytes before anything is written, so `delete 166 .. 178` means the lines you just read in `grep -n` however many lines another op inserts above them, ops go in any order, and a program that cannot resolve writes nothing and reports *every* stale address at once — its last line says so, counting the ops that did resolve, and every one of them is still to do. `replace` and `sub` default to `expect 1` — say `all` for a rename campaign. Preview with `tugutil file edit --preview`, which touches no bytes and no mtime and emits no receipt. `tugedit` is the same verb under its own name. The language is specified in [tuglaws/tugedit.md](tuglaws/tugedit.md).

The rest of the verbs:

```bash
tugutil file edit --patch changes.diff          # a unified diff you already have; --patch - reads it from stdin
tugutil file probe --patch p.diff -- just app-test at0287-….test.ts   # patch, run, restore
tugutil file run -- cargo fmt -p tugedit-core   # run a rewriter, receipt what it moved
```

- **`edit`** is the whole of file editing from the shell: the program shape above for the shapes the interpreters were reached for — several literal pairs on one file, a count guard per pair, a block replaced by a block as a `patch` hunk, a region between two markers, the same rename across several files, a numeric line-range delete, a block appended, a span cut — and `--patch` for a diff you already hold. Either way it prints the same receipt, and a no-match exits non-zero rather than succeeding quietly.
- **`probe`** is the patch → run → revert cycle in one command: it restores bytes *and* mtime afterwards and records nothing, which is strictly better than doing it by hand (a hand-rolled probe leaves a spurious hint on the file it touched). Use it instead of `git checkout --` to revert, which would also destroy any uncommitted work already on those paths.
- **`run`** is for the tool that writes files you did not author: a formatter, a linter's `--fix`, a codegen step. `cargo fmt` names none of its files at all, so nothing can read it — `file run` watches the command instead, fingerprints the repo by content before and after, and receipts exactly what moved. A file the command merely touched is never claimed, and the command's own output and exit status pass straight through. Narrow it with `--scope <path>` when you know where the writes land.
- `sed -i`, `perl -i`, and `ruby -i` are readable **when every file operand is a literal path**. With a glob or a variable they are denied by the PreToolUse gate and steered here — the gate denies only what the grammar proves it cannot resolve.
- `rustfmt`, `prettier --write`, `eslint --fix`, and `biome` are readable on the same terms. A glob is *not* one: a formatter expands its own, so `'src/**/*.ts'` names a set even though the shell left it alone. Those, a bare directory, and `cargo fmt` are steered at `file run`. A `--check` run writes nothing and is never touched.

If the edit is genuinely *computed* — a replacement each match decides for itself — run the program **read-only** to print the result, then put that output into a `write` or `replace` op. The read is a heredoc the gate never minds; the write is a receipt.

## Tugdeck — Theme Token Files

Theme tokens live in `tugdeck/styles/themes/*.css` — `brio`/`nocturne`/`bravura` (dark) and `harmony`/`aria`/`vivace` (light). These are hand-authored CSS files — there is no generation script. Edit them directly when adding or tuning tokens. Each theme is one tint hue over a shared tone skeleton; see `tuglaws/theme-engine.md` for the authoring doctrine. Validate contrast with `bun run audit:theme-contrast` (no theme may exceed the `brio` accessibility budget). Register new themes in `SHIPPED_THEME_NAMES` (`tugdeck/src/action-dispatch.ts`).

## AskUserQuestion — shape and affordances

`AskUserQuestion`'s shape is fixed **upstream by Claude Code's own schema**, not by Tug: **1–4 questions per call, 2–4 options per question** (a hard minimum of 2 and maximum of 4 options). A call outside those bounds fails with an `InputValidationError` inside Claude Code *before* the request is ever forwarded to the Session card — so this is not a constraint Tug can relax by editing anything here.

When generating an `AskUserQuestion` call:
- Give each question **2–4 options**.
- If you have more candidate choices, split them across multiple questions (up to 4 questions per call) — the per-question cap is real, the per-call question count gives you room.

Two rows the terminal renders below the options — **`Type something`** (a free-text answer) and **`Chat about this`** (dismiss the questions and reply in prose) — are harness *affordances*, not options, and don't count against the 2–4 cap. On the answer side they come back as the free-text answer value and the optional top-level `response` field respectively. The Session card's `QuestionDialog` is where Tug renders these (see `chrome/session-question-dialog.tsx`).

Tug-side handling: the `QuestionDialog` renders **any** number of options with no cap of its own — the 2–4 limit lives only in Claude Code upstream. If a call somehow exceeds 4 (e.g. a drifted or hand-crafted payload), `AskUserQuestionToolBlock` detects the `InputValidationError` and mounts a salvage path so the user can still answer. Overflow is therefore graceful, but generate within 2–4 so the round-trip isn't wasted.

## Tugdeck — Tuglaws

Before implementing any tugways/tugdeck code, verify against the [Tuglaws](tuglaws/tuglaws.md) and [Design Decisions](tuglaws/design-decisions.md). Critical laws:

1. **One `root.render()`, at mount, ever.** [L01]
2. **External state enters React through `useSyncExternalStore` only.** [L02]
3. **Use `useLayoutEffect` for registrations that events depend on.** [L03]
4. **Appearance changes go through CSS and DOM, never React state.** [L06]
