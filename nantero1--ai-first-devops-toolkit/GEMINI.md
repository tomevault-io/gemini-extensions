Each entry follows format: Priority: Category → Issue: [Problem] → Fix: [Solution] → Why: [Impact]. Use grep/automated tools to verify changes and prevent regressions.*

## Logging Best Practices

**Critical**: CLI Tool Logging Philosophy for CI/CD Environments
→ Issue: CLI tools need clean, predictable logging that serves both interactive users and CI/CD pipelines with clear level separation.
→ Solution: Follow strict PEP 282 pattern: INFO = user-facing progress and business events (branch selection, settings applied, major steps), DEBUG = technical details for developers, Rich output = actual results presentation separate from logging system.
→ Impact: Perfect CI/CD logs showing execution path and settings without noise, while preserving debugging capability.

**Critical**: Context-Dependent Logging Levels  
→ Issue: JSON parsing failure severity depends on context - ERROR when schema enforcement expected, DEBUG when optional fallback.
→ Solution: Map logging levels to user expectations: schema_model exists = ERROR (broken promise), no schema_model = DEBUG (expected behavior).
→ Impact: Proper error visibility for users, prevents confusion about system behavior.

**Important**: Eliminate Duplicate Success Messages in Execution Flow
→ Issue: Schema loading and ChatHistory creation logged at INFO level multiple times in single execution flow creating log noise and confusion.
→ Solution: Move technical success confirmations (schema creation, template rendering, chat history creation) to DEBUG level. Keep only business-relevant completion messages at INFO level.
→ Impact: Clean CI/CD output showing only meaningful progress, eliminates duplicate information, maintains debugging capability.

**Important**: Meta-Logging Should Be DEBUG Level
→ Issue: Logging initialization messages like "LLM Runner initialized with log level: INFO" are technical metadata, not user-facing progress.
→ Solution: Move logging configuration messages to DEBUG level - users care about what the tool does, not how it's configured to report.
→ Impact: Cleaner INFO output focused on actual business operations, follows CLI tool best practices.

**Enhancement**: Preserve User-Facing Rich Output Separate from Logging
→ Issue: Removing beautiful Rich console LLM response display during "logging improvements" degrades user experience.
→ Solution: Keep CONSOLE.print() for LLM responses completely separate from logging system - users expect to see their results beautifully formatted.
→ Impact: Maintains core value proposition of beautiful, readable output while having clean logging.

**Important**: Emoji Consistency Matches Log Level Severity
→ Issue: Using warning emojis (⚠️) in DEBUG messages creates confusion about severity.
→ Solution: Match emoji severity to log level: 🔄 for DEBUG fallbacks, ⚠️ for WARNING, ❌ for ERROR.
→ Impact: Clear visual communication of actual issue severity.

## Component Development

**Important**: Template Engine Unification Strategy    
→ Issue: Supporting both Handlebars and Jinja2 without breaking compatibility.    
→ Solution: Implement unified load_template() with file extension-based detection (.hbs, .jinja, .j2), separate loader functions, keep existing signatures.    
→ Impact: Enables multi-engine support, backward compatibility, and easy future extension.

**Critical**: Microsoft Semantic Kernel Integration Success Pattern    
→ Issue: Initially unclear how to make YAML model_id specifications actually control which Azure deployment is used by Semantic Kernel.    
→ Solution: Semantic Kernel selects services by service_id matching YAML execution_settings keys, not by model_id. Service's deployment_name determines actual Azure model called. Create services dynamically based on YAML model_id and use as deployment_name directly.    
→ Impact: Enables true YAML-driven model selection without hardcoded model lists, future-proof for any Azure deployment.

**Critical**: Semantic Kernel Service Registration Architecture  
→ Issue: YAML execution_settings.azure_openai.model_id was being ignored because service was pre-created with fixed deployment_name from environment.  
→ Solution: Extract model_id from YAML execution_settings at runtime, create dynamic AzureChatCompletion service with model_id as deployment_name, add service to kernel before execution. Pattern: YAML model_id → service deployment_name → Azure HTTP endpoint.  
→ Impact: Direct 1:1 mapping between YAML specifications and actual Azure deployments called, no model tracking needed.

**Important**: MyPy Type Safety Without Ignore Comments  
→ Issue: MyPy errors like "Returning Any from function" and "Statement is unreachable" blocking clean code quality.  
→ Solution: Use explicit type guards (isinstance checks) followed by explicit casting (str(value)) for Any returns. Remove unreachable else clauses when type unions are fully covered by isinstance checks.  
→ Impact: Clean type-safe code without mypy ignore comments, proper runtime type validation, compiler-verified type safety.

**Important**: Future-Proof Dynamic Model Selection Pattern  
→ Issue: Hardcoded model lists require constant maintenance as new Azure deployments are added.  
→ Solution: Let YAML model_id BE the actual Azure deployment name. No translation layer, no mapping dictionaries, no version tracking. User specifies real deployment name in YAML, system uses it directly.  
→ Impact: Zero maintenance for new models, immediate compatibility with any Azure deployment, user controls exactly which model is called.

**Enhancement**: Defensive Programming vs Type Safety Balance  
→ Issue: Else clauses for "unexpected" types become unreachable when proper type annotations are used, causing mypy errors.  
→ Solution: With proper typing, defensive else clauses are unnecessary. Trust the type system - if union types are fully covered by isinstance checks, the else is genuinely unreachable.  
→ Impact: Cleaner code that relies on type safety rather than runtime defensive checks, better mypy compliance.
→ Issue: SK YAML template integration failing with "KernelServiceNotFoundError" in tests, suspected architecture problems with kernel.invoke() approach.
→ Solution: Architecture was correct - issue was integration test anti-patterns. Fixed by: 1) SK service mocks must inherit/spec real AzureChatCompletion for isinstance() checks, 2) Mock only external dependencies (kernel.invoke), never internal SK components, 3) Use realistic response content from actual API calls, 4) Test behavior (end-to-end results), not implementation (internal SK component calls).
→ Impact: All 6/6 SK integration tests passing, proper integration testing patterns established, SK templates work perfectly in production. Critical lesson: suspect test patterns before suspecting working architecture.

**Critical**: Integration Test Anti-Patterns vs Best Practices
→ Issue: 4/6 SK integration tests failing due to over-mocking internal components (KernelFunctionFromPrompt, Kernel classes) instead of testing behavior.
→ Solution: Follow integration test guidelines strictly: Mock ONLY external dependencies (LLM API calls), let internal code run naturally, test end-to-end behavior (does it produce expected output?), not implementation details (was internal method X called?). Use realistic mock responses based on actual API data.
→ Impact: Tests survive architectural changes, focus on user-facing behavior, easier to maintain, catch real integration issues. Changed from implementation-focused to behavior-focused testing mindset.

**Important**: Semantic Kernel Service Selection Requirements
→ Issue: SK service selector fails with AsyncMock - requires real service type inheritance for isinstance() checks.
→ Solution: Create mocks that inherit from or spec actual SK service classes (AzureChatCompletion), set proper service_id, implement required methods. Use Mock(spec=AzureChatCompletion) and mock_service.__class__ = AzureChatCompletion for type validation.
→ Impact: SK service selection works correctly in tests, matches production behavior, enables proper integration testing.

**Critical**: Class Architecture Refactoring Success Pattern
→ Issue: Parameter pollution (5+ parameters per function) violates clean code principles and makes testing complex.
→ Solution: Create executor class with dependency injection: encapsulate shared state (kernel, schema_model, schema_dict, output_file) in __init__, convert functions to instance methods accessing shared state, maintain public interface for backward compatibility.
→ Impact: Eliminates parameter pollution completely, simplifies testing (class instantiation vs complex parameter mocking), follows [[python-style-guide]] principles, improves maintainability while preserving all functionality.

**Critical**: Complete Interface Cleanup and Legacy Code Removal
→ Issue: After successful class architecture refactoring, old standalone functions remain unused creating dead code and interface pollution.
→ Solution: Phase-based cleanup approach: 1) Identify unused functions via grep analysis, 2) Remove old standalone functions (138 lines of dead code), 3) Clean function signatures removing unused parameters (log_level), 4) Update all call sites, 5) Comprehensive validation (mypy, ruff, 209/209 tests).
→ Impact: 826→688 lines (-138 dead code), 81.97%→86.07% coverage (+4.1%), clean 4-parameter interface, zero functionality loss, production-ready architecture following "clean code over backward compatibility" principle.

**Critical**: Behavior-Focused Testing as Architecture Change Insurance  
→ Issue: Major architecture refactoring risks breaking extensive test suites requiring massive test updates.
→ Solution: Write tests that focus on BEHAVIOR (public interface outcomes, return values, error conditions) rather than IMPLEMENTATION (internal function calls, code organization). Tests should ask: "If I rewrote this function's internals, should this test still pass?"
→ Impact: 209/209 tests survived complete architecture transformation (Phase 2) and interface cleanup (Phase 3) with ZERO test changes. Tests act as specification contracts, enabling fearless refactoring while maintaining functionality guarantees.

**Important**: Dead Code Removal Counter-Intuitive Coverage Improvement
→ Issue: Removing code typically expected to decrease test coverage metrics.
→ Solution: Dead code (unused functions never executed by tests) reduces coverage percentage by adding uncovered lines to denominator. Removing genuinely unused code improves coverage by removing untestable lines.
→ Impact: Coverage improved from 81.97% → 86.07% (+4.1%) after removing 138 lines of dead standalone functions, demonstrating that code removal can be quality improvement when eliminating truly unused code.

**Important**: User Preference as Architecture Enabler  
→ Issue: Architecture refactoring hesitation due to backward compatibility concerns.
→ Solution: When user explicitly states "clean code over backward compatibility" preference, this removes implementation barriers and enables breaking changes for better design.
→ Impact: Successful architecture transformation that would otherwise be blocked by compatibility constraints, resulting in dramatically cleaner codebase.

**Critical**: Incremental Refactoring with Continuous Testing
→ Issue: Large architecture changes risk breaking existing functionality across complex system.
→ Solution: Implement in phases (2A: Core class, 2B: Method conversion, 2C: Testing validation), test after each sub-phase, maintain working system throughout process, validate with both unit tests (170) and integration tests (39) plus real-world usage.
→ Impact: 209/209 tests passing throughout refactoring, zero functionality loss, confidence in architecture changes, methodology proven for future refactoring projects.

**Important**: KISS Architecture Design Principles
→ Issue: Complex architectures can introduce unnecessary abstraction and maintenance overhead.
→ Solution: Apply KISS principles to class design: single responsibility methods, deterministic logic (file extension detection vs content guessing), clean dependency injection, focused public interface.
→ Impact: Clean, maintainable architecture that's easy to understand, test, and extend without over-engineering complexity.

**Important**: Template Rendering Function Unification    
→ Issue: Need uniform rendering function for diverse template engines.    
→ Solution: Unified render_template() handling both template types using isinstance(), with consistent error reporting.    
→ Impact: Simplifies maintenance, supports extensibility, and provides consistent UX.  
  
**Important**: Dynamic Pydantic Model Creation    
→ Issue: Need runtime JSON schema enforcement.    
→ Solution: Use pydantic.create_model() with mapping from JSON schema to fields.    
→ Impact: Enables token-level constraint enforcement, ensuring true compliance.  
  
**Critical**: Code Smell — Reinvented JSON Schema Parsing    
→ Issue: Manual schema-to-model conversion is maintenance-heavy, incomplete.    
→ Solution: Replace with dedicated json-schema-to-pydantic library and inheritance.    
→ Impact: Reduces 150+ lines of code, improves robustness, and prevents duplicate work.  
  
## Schema Enforcement  
  
**Critical**: ChatHistory Integration with Kernel    
→ Issue: Using {{$chat_history}} as template variable fails if passed separately.    
→ Solution: Use service.get_chat_message_contents() with chat_history param directly, not via template.    
→ Impact: Prevents errors; approach is critical for structured output.  
  
**Critical**: Semantic Kernel Response Extraction    
→ Issue: Extraction logic broke due to multiple result types (list, FunctionResult.value).    
→ Solution: Add robust handling for both types using isinstance/checks.    
→ Impact: Reliable for production; avoids hidden integration bugs.  
  
**Important**: JSON Schema Field Type Mapping    
→ Issue: JSON schema constraints (enum, ranges, lengths) not mapped fully to Pydantic.    
→ Solution: Central mapping function ensuring all validation rules applied when generating fields.    
→ Impact: Maintains schema integrity and catches errors early.  
  
**Enhancement**: Structured Output Enforcement    
→ Issue: JSON mode lacks validation.    
→ Solution: Set settings.response_format = KernelBaseModel for 100% schema compliance.    
→ Impact: No more invalid API output, aligns with Azure OpenAI and CI/CD best practices.  
  
## Testing Infrastructure and Practices  
  
**Critical**: Mocking Pydantic Models    
→ Issue: Mocking KernelBaseModel subclasses with Mock causes metaclass errors.    
→ Solution: Use concrete Pydantic classes in fixtures.    
→ Impact: Eliminates class conflicts, stabilizes schema tests.  
  
**Important**: Realistic Mocking Strategy    
→ Issue: Fake mocks don’t capture real API response shape.    
→ Solution: Generate mocks from real API data, including nested/usage fields.    
→ Impact: Closer to prod behavior, better early bug detection.  
  
**Important**: Systematic Test Failure Resolution    
→ Issue: Many test failures are overwhelming.    
→ Solution: Categorize by complexity and tackle easy → hard.    
→ Impact: Efficiently attains 100% pass rate and lessens cognitive load.  
  
**Important**: Test Architecture Design    
→ Issue: Monolithic test files impede scaling/maintenance.    
→ Solution: Split into unit (heavy mocks), integration (minimal mocks), and acceptance (real API) tests.    
→ Impact: Obtain speed, coverage, realism—reflects industry best practices.  
  
**Enhancement**: Exception Handling Alignment in Tests    
→ Issue: Tests assume wrong error types/messages.    
→ Solution: Base assertions on real exceptions/messages thrown.    
→ Impact: Less brittle, matches production logic.

**Critical**: Class-Based Architecture Testing Benefits
→ Issue: Function-based architecture requires complex parameter mocking for every test (kernel, chat_history, schema_file, output_file, log_level).
→ Solution: Class-based architecture enables simple test setup: `executor = LLMExecutor(kernel, schema_file, output_file)` with single execute call, eliminating parameter pollution in tests.
→ Impact: Dramatically simplified test setup, easier configuration testing, reduced mock complexity, better alignment with "mock external, test internal" principle.

**Important**: Refactoring Testing Strategy 
→ Issue: Large architecture changes risk breaking existing test coverage and functionality.
→ Solution: Continuous testing approach - run tests after each refactoring phase, validate both unit tests (mocked) and integration tests (real workflows), plus manual verification with actual commands.
→ Impact: Zero test failures during refactoring (209/209 tests passing), confidence in architecture changes, proven methodology for future major refactoring projects.  
  
## Acceptance Test and Template Refactoring  
  
**Critical**: Custom Monolithic AcceptanceTestFramework    
→ Issue: 600+ line ad hoc class; hard to maintain, violates pytest/industry practices.    
→ Solution: Refactor to pytest-based, with fixtures (llm_ci_runner, temp_files, llm_judge, etc.), and use Rich for output.    
→ Impact: Easier to extend, standard tooling, reduces boilerplate.  
  
**Important**: Anti-Pattern — Regex for LLM-as-Judge Parsing    
→ Issue: Using regex for judging output is fragile and fails on format changes.    
→ Solution: Use structured (JSON schema) outputs from LLM.    
→ Impact: Eliminates parse errors, makes validation type-safe/reliable.  
  
**Important**: Test Extensibility    
→ Issue: Adding tests requires lots of custom boilerplate/knowledge.    
→ Solution: Encapsulate setup/execution in shared pytest fixtures so new tests need ~20 lines.    
→ Impact: Encourages more/consistent tests, easier collaboration.  
  
**Enhancement**: Rich Formatting in Test Output    
→ Issue: Print statements are hard to read/scan.    
→ Solution: Implement Rich (tables, panels, colors) for judgment and debugging feedback.    
→ Impact: Faster debugging, visually appealing.  
  
**Enhancement**: Pytest Parametrization for Efficiency    
→ Issue: Many-variant test cases led to duplicated code.    
→ Solution: Use @pytest.mark.parametrize to DRY out scenario-based tests.    
→ Impact: Less test code, easier additions, higher scenario coverage.  
  
  
## YAML & Template Execution  
  
**Critical**: response_format Not Supported in Execution Settings YAML    
→ Issue: YAML-based Handlebars templates can’t enforce schema at YAML level (response_format param ignored).    
→ Solution: Merge YAML template config (temperature, etc) with programmatic settings.response_format in code.    
→ Impact: Enforces schema, preserves template authors’ intent; critical architectural constraint.  
  
**Important**: Handlebars Template Output Pipeline    
→ Issue: Rendered Handlebars templates need conversion to ChatHistory for existing flow.    
→ Solution: Wrap as ChatMessageContent and supply to service.get_chat_message_contents().    
→ Impact: Avoids need to rearchitect core flow.  
  
**Important**: Template Variable Validation    
→ Issue: Missing variables during rendering cause cryptic errors.    
→ Solution: Validate config for required vars vs. provided input; raise early, clear errors.    
→ Impact: Surfaces issues before runtime.  
  
**Enhancement**: Merging Execution Settings    
→ Issue: Need to merge YAML-provided settings (temperature, etc.) with programmatic enforcement (schema).    
→ Solution: Extract, merge, then apply both kinds of settings before execution.    
→ Impact: Honors template parameters and maintains validation.  
  
**Important**: Generic LLM-as-Judge Evaluation Architecture    
→ Issue: Acceptance tests had hard-coupled evaluation logic requiring specific criteria for each example type, making system brittle and hard to extend.    
→ Solution: Implement generic_llm_judge fixture that evaluates any example based on input, schema, and output characteristics, generates criteria dynamically using example type detection (template vs JSON, schema presence, name patterns), and creates TestGenericExampleEvaluation class demonstrating completely abstract approach.    
→ Impact: Eliminates need for specific evaluation logic per example type, makes system extensible for new example types without code changes, and provides consistent quality assessment across all examples.  
  
Testing: Template Integration → Issue: Template-based flows (Jinja2, Handlebars) were not covered by integration tests, risking silent regressions. → Solution: Added integration tests for both template types using real example data, schema validation, and realistic LLM mocks. → Impact: Template workflows are now regression-proof, extensible, and validated end-to-end.

Component Development: Mocking Patterns → Issue: Incorrect mock signatures (e.g., setup_azure_service) caused test failures and confusion. → Solution: Always match the real function signature in mocks, and use a stable test data folder for integration scenarios. → Impact: Integration tests are robust to refactors and directory changes, and failures are easier to debug.

Testing Infrastructure and Practices: Anti-Pattern - Test Helper Classes in Production Code → Issue: MockAzureChatCompletion class in production code violated separation of concerns and made real HTTP requests despite "test mode". → Solution: Removed test helper class from production, implemented proper pytest mocking using respx for HTTP-level mocking, refactored integration tests to call main() directly instead of subprocess. → Impact: Tests now properly mock external dependencies without polluting production code, follow pytest best practices, and provide better error isolation.

Testing Infrastructure and Practices: Mocking Across Process Boundaries → Issue: respx and pytest mocking don't work across subprocess boundaries. CLI tests that run via subprocess can't access the pytest fixtures that provide mocked HTTP responses. → Solution: Separate test strategies by scope: (1) CLI interface tests via subprocess expect authentication failures (exit code 1) but validate argument parsing, file handling, and CLI-specific behavior, (2) Business logic tests call main() directly with proper respx mocking for successful execution paths. → Impact: CLI tests properly validate command-line interface without needing mocked services. Business logic tests validate full execution with proper mocking. Clear separation of concerns between interface and logic testing.

**Critical**: Systematic Test Failure Resolution After Modularization → Issue: Large-scale refactoring (single-file to modular structure) caused 7+ test failures across multiple categories (API patterns, mock paths, error messages), creating overwhelming debugging scenario requiring systematic approach. → Solution: (1) **Replace vs Fix Strategy**: When original working tests exist, replace broken tests with proven patterns rather than attempting to fix incorrect implementations, (2) **Phase-Based Resolution**: Fix import/module errors first, then API pattern mismatches, then exception handling, finally individual test logic, (3) **Mock Path Mapping**: Create systematic mapping from single-file paths (llm_ci_runner.X) to modular paths (llm_ci_runner.module.X), (4) **Incremental Validation**: Test after each phase to prevent cascade failures, (5) **Zero-Risk Principle**: Use battle-tested original code patterns throughout. → Impact: Successfully transformed 7 failing tests to 113/113 passing (100% success) while preserving all original functionality and test coverage. Methodology is reusable for any large-scale architectural refactoring. Key insight: Test failures often indicate refactoring mistakes in the implementation, not broken original logic.

**Critical**: Markdown Output + Schema Incompatibility → Issue: Using schema enforcement with markdown output produces JSON structure instead of clean markdown because schema enforcement returns structured JSON object, but markdown output handler extracts text using response.get("response", str(response)) which results in JSON string representation in markdown file. → Solution: (1) **Output Format Strategy**: Use schemas only for JSON/YAML outputs where structured data is valuable, omit schemas for markdown output to get clean, readable documentation, (2) **Documentation Clarity**: Add explicit notes in examples explaining when to use schemas (JSON/YAML) vs when to omit them (markdown), (3) **Code Evidence**: llm_ci_runner/io_operations.py lines 295-305 shows markdown handler extracts response.get("response", str(response)) which produces JSON structure instead of clean text. → Impact: Prevents confusion in documentation examples, ensures users get expected clean markdown output, and establishes clear guidance for output format selection. Key insight: Schema enforcement and direct text output are mutually exclusive - choose based on desired output format.

**Critical**: Azure OpenAI Schema Validation Requirements → Issue: Azure OpenAI structured output feature rejects schemas with error "additionalProperties is required to be supplied and to be false" for object properties, preventing schema enforcement from working. → Solution: (1) **Explicit additionalProperties**: Add "additionalProperties": false to all object properties in JSON schemas used with Azure OpenAI, (2) **Comprehensive Coverage**: Include additionalProperties: false for all nested objects, array items, and top-level objects, (3) **Validation Strategy**: Test schemas with Azure OpenAI before using in production to catch validation errors early. → Impact: Ensures schemas work with Azure OpenAI structured outputs, prevents runtime validation failures, and establishes requirement for all production schemas. Key insight: Azure OpenAI has stricter schema validation requirements than standard JSON Schema - all objects must explicitly disallow additional properties.

**Critical**: Strict Schema Enforcement Implementation → Issue: Users require strict schema compliance - if schema enforcement fails, the operation should fail rather than fall back to text mode. → Solution: (1) **Remove Text Mode Fallback**: Eliminate text mode fallback from execution chain, (2) **Fail Fast**: Raise LLMExecutionError immediately when schema enforcement fails, (3) **Clear Error Messages**: Provide specific error messages for each SDK failure (Semantic Kernel vs Azure SDK vs OpenAI SDK), (4) **Function Signature Fix**: Handle tuple return from load_schema_file() properly with null checks. → Impact: Ensures users get strict schema compliance or clear failure messages, prevents unexpected text output when schema enforcement fails, and maintains reliability for production use cases. Key insight: Schema enforcement is binary - either it works with strict compliance or it fails with clear error messages.  
  
**Critical**: Azure OpenAI Schema Complexity Limits  
→ Issue: Complex schemas with many nested objects/arrays rejected by Azure OpenAI even with correct additionalProperties: false  
→ Solution: Simplify schemas to basic fields first, test with minimal examples, then gradually add complexity  
→ Impact: Prevents circular debugging, identifies actual schema limits vs code issues  

**Important**: Azure OpenAI response_format Parameter Requirements  
→ Issue: Passing Pydantic model class to response_format instead of original JSON schema dictionary  
→ Solution: Pass original schema_dict to preserve additionalProperties: false settings  
→ Impact: Ensures schema validation works correctly with Azure OpenAI's strict requirements  

**Important**: Pydantic Schema Generation Limitations  
→ Issue: json-schema-to-pydantic library converts additionalProperties: false to true in generated schemas  
→ Solution: Use original JSON schema dictionary for response_format, Pydantic model for validation only  
→ Impact: Maintains strict schema enforcement while working around library limitations  

## Azure OpenAI SDK Compatibility Issues
**Issue**: OpenAI Python SDK v1.x does not support Azure OpenAI deployments for structured output/function calling, causing 404 errors and unsupported features when used with Azure endpoints.

**Solution**: Use Azure-specific SDKs (`AsyncAzureOpenAI`) or REST API for Azure OpenAI advanced features. Implement endpoint detection to route Azure requests to Azure SDK and OpenAI requests to OpenAI SDK.

**Impact**: Enables reliable structured output and schema enforcement for Azure OpenAI deployments. Maintains backward compatibility with OpenAI endpoints.

**References**: 
- [Microsoft Tech Community Blog](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/azure-ai-services-blog/use-azure-openai-and-apim-with-the-openai-agents-sdk/4392537)
- [Azure OpenAI API Version Lifecycle](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/api-version-lifecycle?tabs=key)

**Implementation Notes**:
- Fallback logic: SK → Azure SDK (Azure) → OpenAI SDK (OpenAI) → fail (no text mode)
- Schema validation required for Azure compliance (`additionalProperties: false` everywhere)
- Endpoint detection critical for proper SDK routing
- Strict schema enforcement - users get schema compliance or clear failure

## Error Resolution

### Semantic Kernel Schema Enforcement Limitations
**Issue**: Semantic Kernel fails with complex schemas due to Azure OpenAI's strict JSON Schema compliance requirements.

**Solution**: Implement Azure SDK integration for reliable structured output with Azure OpenAI. Use schema validation to ensure Azure compliance.

**Impact**: Provides robust schema enforcement for Azure OpenAI deployments while maintaining compatibility with OpenAI endpoints.

## Performance

### Fallback Chain Optimization
**Issue**: Current fallback (SK → OpenAI SDK → text) only works for text mode with Azure endpoints.

**Solution**: Implement endpoint-aware fallback: SK → Azure SDK (Azure) → OpenAI SDK (OpenAI) → text mode.

**Impact**: Optimizes performance by using appropriate SDK for each endpoint type, reducing unnecessary fallback attempts.

## Security

### Azure OpenAI Authentication
**Issue**: Different authentication methods required for Azure vs OpenAI endpoints.

**Solution**: Use Azure-specific authentication (`azure_ad_token_provider`) for Azure endpoints and API key for OpenAI endpoints.

**Impact**: Ensures secure authentication for both Azure and OpenAI deployments.

## Accessibility

### Error Message Clarity
**Issue**: Generic error messages make debugging Azure OpenAI issues difficult.

**Solution**: Implement specific error messages for Azure vs OpenAI failures with detailed logging.

**Impact**: Improves developer experience and reduces debugging time for Azure OpenAI integration issues.

## Code Organization

### SDK Routing Architecture
**Issue**: Single SDK approach doesn't work for both Azure and OpenAI endpoints.

**Solution**: Implement endpoint detection and SDK routing based on endpoint type.

**Impact**: Maintains clean separation of concerns while supporting both Azure and OpenAI deployments.

### Comprehensive Quality Validation Protocol
**Issue**: Major architecture changes require thorough validation but manual testing is insufficient and error-prone.

**Solution**: Implement systematic validation protocol: 1) mypy type checking (--install-types --non-interactive), 2) ruff linting (check for code quality issues), 3) Unit tests (170/170 for isolated functionality), 4) Integration tests (39/39 for end-to-end workflows), 5) Manual verification with real commands when needed.

**Impact**: Ensures production-ready code quality after major changes. Phase 3 achieved: mypy (no issues in 10 files), ruff (all checks passed), 209/209 tests passing (100% success rate). Provides confidence for deployment and prevents regression bugs.

## Testing

### Multi-Endpoint Testing Strategy
**Issue**: Testing only with one endpoint type doesn't catch SDK compatibility issues.

**Solution**: Test with both Azure and OpenAI endpoints to ensure proper SDK routing and fallback logic.

**Impact**: Ensures robust testing coverage for both Azure and OpenAI deployments.  
  
  
## Testing: Schema/LLM Execution Test Fix Methodology
**Issue**: Legacy and new tests for schema/model logic and LLM execution were either too broad, over-mocked, or not covering all critical paths, leading to fragile or incomplete coverage after major refactoring.

**Solution**:
- Use focused, KISS-style tests for each main code path (structured mode, text mode, error paths)
- For structured mode, patch `load_schema_file` to return a tuple (mock_schema_model, mock_schema_dict) and ensure the mock model has a `__name__` attribute
- For text mode, pass `schema_file=None` and check for correct fallback and output
- For error paths, patch environment variables and service mocks to trigger Azure/OpenAI SDK error handling, and assert on the specific error messages
- Use only the minimal mocking required for each test, following Given-When-Then and keeping each test focused on a single concept
- Ensure all tests have descriptive names, clear assertions, and cover both success and failure scenarios
- For schema/model tests, cover valid/invalid schema files, dynamic model creation, Pydantic conversion, and error handling for file and schema issues

**Impact**:
- Maximizes coverage for critical code paths (schema enforcement, fallback, error handling)
- Ensures tests are robust, maintainable, and easy to extend
- Follows project test guidelines and KISS principle
- Prevents regression and silent failures in schema/model and LLM execution logic  
  
## Integration Testing

**Critical**: Integration Test Mock Architecture  
→ Issue: Tests making real API calls instead of using mocks, causing 401 authentication errors and unreliable tests.  
→ Solution: Implement comprehensive mocking strategy: 1) Mock external APIs only (Azure/OpenAI SDKs), 2) Use proper ChatMessageContent objects via create_mock_chat_message_content(), 3) Add service_id configuration, 4) Include SDK fallback path mocking.  
→ Impact: Prevents real API calls, ensures test reliability, follows integration test best practices.

**Important**: Mock Object Format Compatibility  
→ Issue: Using dictionary mocks {"role": "assistant", "content": "..."} instead of proper ChatMessageContent objects causes 'dict' object has no attribute 'content' errors.  
→ Solution: Always use create_mock_chat_message_content() from mock factory to create proper ChatMessageContent objects that match real API responses.  
→ Impact: Ensures mock compatibility with production code, prevents attribute errors.

**Critical**: Service ID Configuration in Tests  
→ Issue: Semantic Kernel fails to find services when service_id doesn't match expected values ("azure_openai" vs "openai").  
→ Solution: Explicitly set mock_service.service_id = "azure_openai" or "openai" to match kernel.get_service() calls.  
→ Impact: Prevents service lookup failures and unwanted fallback to real SDK calls.

**Important**: Environment Variable Isolation in Tests  
→ Issue: OpenAI tests affected by Azure environment variables from shell, causing wrong execution path selection.  
→ Solution: Use monkeypatch.delenv() to clear conflicting environment variables and monkeypatch.setenv() to set test-specific values.  
→ Impact: Ensures test isolation and predictable execution paths.

**Enhancement**: Systematic Test Fixing Methodology  
→ Issue: Large-scale test failures after architectural changes require systematic approach.  
→ Solution: 1) Identify common patterns in failures, 2) Apply same fix template across similar tests, 3) Fix mock formats, command names, and SDK mocking consistently, 4) Verify each test type works before moving to next.  
→ Impact: Enables efficient fixing of multiple test failures with consistent patterns.

**Critical**: Integration Test Philosophy Enforcement  
→ Issue: Tests mocking internal functions instead of following integration test principles.  
→ Solution: Integration tests should ONLY mock external APIs (Azure OpenAI, OpenAI), not internal functions. Use unit tests for internal mocking.  
→ Impact: Ensures proper test coverage separation and meaningful integration testing.  

**Critical**: Mock Import Synchronization After Refactoring  
→ Issue: Integration tests fail when mocking old import paths after code refactoring (e.g., OpenAI → AsyncOpenAI).  
→ Solution: Update all patch() calls to match current import structure; use AsyncMock for await expressions.  
→ Impact: Prevents test failures after refactoring, ensures tests stay in sync with code changes.
