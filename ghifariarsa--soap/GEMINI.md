# Project agent memory

This file is the project's committed home for project-intrinsic agent knowledge: build, test, release, architecture, and sharp-edge notes that should travel with the code.

- Add durable project-specific notes here as they are discovered through real work.

## Architecture invariants

- **Disk is the source of truth.** Every mutation rewrites `documents/<id>/info.yaml`
  first, then re-syncs the SQLite index (rebuildable). Write through the helpers in
  `soap/library.py` (`save_document`, `set_review_status`, `set_read_status`,
  `edit_document`, `delete_document`), never the DB directly. Those helpers validate
  document IDs and file references at the library boundary, and metadata YAML
  replacement is atomic; `resolve_file_ref_path` is also the TUI open boundary.
- **Library paths are owner-private; shell exports are quoted.** Anything a
  library owns is forced to `0700`/`0600` after it is created or copied via
  `soap/permissions.py:make_private` (source files keep their original mode
  only until they land inside the library) — never rely on umask or an atomic
  rename to set the mode. Generated shell startup code must go through
  `soap/shell.py:export_line`, which shell-quotes `SOAP_DIR` per shell
  (POSIX/`shlex` for bash/zsh/unknown-fallback, single-quote escaping for
  fish) and rejects NUL bytes and the reserved `# >>> soap >>>` block markers;
  never `f"...{path}..."` a path straight into a config line. Regression
  coverage: `tests/test_security.py`.
- **Link adds download the PDF.** A URL/bare-arXiv-id add resolves metadata *and*
  best-effort downloads the paper's PDF (`soap/ingest/download.py:download_pdf`,
  driven from `soap/ingest/url.py:resolve_url(download=...)`): arXiv's canonical
  `/pdf/<id>.pdf`, a direct `.pdf` URL, or an open-access PDF a DOI exposes
  (Crossref `link`, else the doi.org redirect if it lands on a real PDF). It streams
  to a temp file and keeps it only if the first bytes are the `%PDF` magic marker —
  content-type is advisory, so even `application/pdf` must start with `%PDF` — caps
  size, and hands the temp to `_add_body` which stores+attaches it via the normal
  local-file path (sha256, `attach_file`); the temp is always cleaned up in
  `_add_inner`'s finally. Download is gated `fetch and not dry_run`; a failed/paywalled
  download degrades to metadata-only with a warning — never crashes. The PDF is still
  never parsed (the abstract comes from the metadata API, not the file).
- **Outbound HTTP is SSRF-hardened.** Both metadata fetches (`soap/ingest/fetch.py`)
  and the PDF download (`soap/ingest/download.py`) follow redirects manually one hop at
  a time and route every hop — including the explicit user URL — through
  `soap/ingest/network.py:validate_url`, which rejects non-HTTP(S) schemes, embedded
  credentials, and any host that is or resolves to a loopback/private/link-local/reserved
  address (`MAX_REDIRECTS` cap). Response bodies are size-bounded before a parser sees
  them (`MAX_METADATA_BYTES` for metadata, `MAX_PDF_BYTES` for the PDF). Parsers
  (`parse_crossref`/`parse_arxiv`/`parse_openlibrary`) validate payload shape at the
  boundary and return `None` on malformed/wrong-type provider data, so `add` degrades
  with a warning instead of crashing. Regression-tested in `tests/test_ingest.py` — keep
  these seams injectable and never weaken the address checks. `_bounded_get`
  reconstructs a fresh `httpx.Response` from the *decoded* streamed body, so it
  first strips the provider's now-inaccurate `Content-Encoding`/`Content-Length`
  headers — leaving them makes httpx re-run the gzip decoder on plain bytes and
  raise `DecodingError`, silently turning every gzipped metadata lookup into a
  miss (Open Library/Crossref gzip by default).
- **CLI and TUI share the review core.** The interactive walk lives in
  `soap/library.py:review_inbox` (IO fully injected: `render`/`ask_action`/
  `confirm_delete`/`report`/`prompt_field`) so it is unit-tested without a terminal
  (`tests/test_inbox_review.py`). CLI (`soap/cli/inbox.py`) and TUI
  (`soap/tui/review.py`) are thin shims — keep their review semantics consistent.
- **Inline correction walk:** `soap/library.py:prompt_fields` walks the core fields
  (`CORE_REVIEW_FIELDS`: title/authors/year/type/venue), prefilled, Enter-keeps /
  type-overrides. It **pins the citekey/id** on a review-edit (never renames the
  folder); only a brand-new `add()` derives a fresh key. Shared by the CLI `[c]orrect`
  action, the TUI review form, the TUI browser's `E` in-app edit form
  (`soap/tui/edit.py`), and `soap add --confirm`.
- **Browser edit/delete reuse the review core.** The main browser
  (`soap/tui/app.py`) exposes `E` (in-app core-field edit → `EditScreen` in
  `soap/tui/edit.py`, which drives `prompt_fields`+`save_document`, id pinned) and
  `d` (delete → `ConfirmDeleteScreen` in `soap/tui/confirm.py` → `delete_document`).
  `e` stays the full-YAML `$EDITOR` power option. Both go through the library helpers
  (never the DB); delete is confirm-gated. Pilot coverage:
  `tests/test_tui_browser_edit_delete.py`.
- **BibTeX export is read-only and pure.** `soap/bibtex.py` serializes
  `Document`s to a deterministic `.bib` (entries ordered by citekey, entry key =
  `id`, `type`→BibTeX type via `_TYPE_MAP` fallback `misc`, `venue`→`journal` or
  `booktitle` by type, char-by-char LaTeX escaping — never sequential
  `str.replace`, which re-escapes inserted braces). `serialize_documents` returns
  a `BibtexResult` partitioning inputs into `exported_ids`/`skipped_ids` so
  callers report drops instead of silently losing records. The app hydrates
  chosen docs through `DocumentService.get_document` and writes the file — it
  never mutates the library or hits the network. Coverage: `tests/test_bibtex.py`
  + `tests/test_tui_export.py`.
- **`space` marks rows; marks make `t`/`d`/`x` bulk-first.** `DocumentList.marked`
  (`soap/tui/widgets.py`) tracks a selection (marker glyph replaces the status
  glyph, pruned to present ids on `populate`); toggling is **quiet** (no toast).
  When any row is marked, `t` opens the additive bulk-tag flow
  (`soap/tui/tags.py:BulkTagScreen` — collects tags, app unions them onto each
  doc via `save_document`, existing tags kept), `d` opens one count-aware
  confirm (`soap/tui/confirm.py:ConfirmBulkDeleteScreen` → `delete_document` per
  id), and `x` exports the selection (`soap/tui/export.py`:
  `ExportScopeScreen`→`ExportDestinationScreen`; also in the `^p` palette). A bulk
  `t`/`d` consumes the selection (`clear_marks` on success), reports outcome +
  failures, and never touches the DB directly. With nothing marked, `t`/`d` keep
  the single-document behavior. `u` (`action_clear_selection`) quietly unselects
  all (no-op when empty); it lives in the `?` reference + `^p` palette,
  deliberately NOT on the footer, and is safe next to search because a focused
  `Input` consumes the keypress. The persistent footer (`_cheatbar`) is reduced to
  select/edit/tag/read/export/pane/`?`; the full reference (`?`) and palette
  (`^p`) stay discoverable off the bar. Coverage: `tests/test_tui_bulk_actions.py`.
- **Export destination resolution is one shared function.**
  `soap/tui/export.py:resolve_export_path(raw, cwd)` (relative→`cwd` = the launch
  directory, not the library; `~` expanded; `.bib` added only when no suffix)
  backs both the modal's live `saves to …` preview and its dismissed value, so
  `ExportDestinationScreen` returns the fully resolved absolute path and the app
  writes it verbatim — no second, drift-prone resolution. Coverage:
  `tests/test_tui_export.py`.
- **`always_review: true`** is the shipped default (`soap/cli/init.py`), so the review
  queue is the primary add path — weight review UX accordingly.
- **TUI is view-only over theme tokens.** The "Aqua Slate" redesign lives entirely in
  the view layer: `soap/tui/themes.py` (palettes), `app.tcss` (structure/borders),
  `soap/tui/widgets.py` + `widgets_detail.py` (list `DataTable` + detail), and
  `soap/tui/review.py`. Widgets emit theme slots (`$primary`/`$accent`/`$success`/…)
  and shared markup helpers (`soap/tui/_markup.py`: `sep`/`key`/`confidence_meter`),
  **never hardcoded hex** — so a theme change reskins everything. The app root
  (`App, Screen` in `app.tcss`) is `background: ansi_default` (terminal-default
  background = SGR 49) so the terminal's own, possibly transparent, background
  shows through — like lazygit/Claude Code. This is terminal-background
  passthrough, **not** emulator opacity control soap can set. Two pieces are load-
  bearing and must stay together: `ansi_default` (NOT `transparent` — `App.render`
  paints a `Blank` of the root color with nothing beneath it, so plain
  `transparent` flattens to solid black), and `ansi_color=True` on `SoapApp`
  (`soap/tui/app.py`) which keeps Textual's ANSI→truecolor filter off so
  `ansi_default` survives to the terminal instead of being re-flattened to an
  opaque RGB fill. Truecolor theme colors (panes/borders/text) are unaffected;
  the opaque pane/card rules keep the UI readable and always seat text on an
  opaque surface. Don't reintroduce an opaque or `transparent` `App`/`Screen`
  background, and don't drop `ansi_color=True` (regression: the
  `test_app_root_is_terminal_default_but_theme_surfaces_are_not` PTY-verified
  invariant in `tests/test_themes.py`). `sep()` also fixes
  Textual's span-boundary whitespace stripping (the old `sourcearxiv`/`movej/k` mash);
  use it for every `label<space>value`. The list feed adds display-only columns to
  `DocumentService.list_documents` (venue/read_status/author summary) — read-only, no
  schema change. Regenerate the reference screenshots with
  `uv run python scripts/shoot_tui.py` (writes SVGs to `docs/screens/`).
- **README demo GIFs are generated, not hand-recorded.** `docs/demo.gif` (TUI
  browse/organize tour) and `docs/add.gif` (ingest + review story) are
  regenerated by `uv run python scripts/demo.py`, which renders each tape
  (`scripts/demo.tape` + `scripts/demo-add.tape`) from its own throwaway
  `HOME`/`SOAP_DIR` (browse: seeded invented papers, same idea as `shoot_tui.py`;
  add: fresh library + placeholder PDFs under a throwaway `~/Downloads`) driving
  the real `soap` binary via VHS (`charmbracelet/vhs`). Needs `vhs`+`ttyd`+`ffmpeg`
  on PATH. Leaks nothing real. The browse tape is fully offline; the **add tape
  hits the live network** (Open Library ISBN + arXiv) for two of its three adds —
  so re-rendering `add.gif` needs those services up. Sync tapes on width-invariant
  on-screen text (e.g. `BROWSE`, a citekey), never the truncation-prone
  `All documents · N` title. Details: `docs/releasing.md` § Regenerating the demo GIFs.
- **Tags are first-class in the TUI.** Edit via the `t` key → `soap/tui/tags.py`
  `TagEditScreen` (keyboard-first: enter/comma adds, `tab` completes the top
  suggestion from `DocumentService.tag_counts()`, empty-`backspace` drops the last
  chip, `^s` saves, `esc` cancels). It persists the whole document through
  `save_document` (rewrites `info.yaml` + reindex — never raw DB) so chips and the
  sidebar tag counts refresh live. Filtering is the existing sidebar
  `filter_kind="tag"` path (`app.py:_sidebar_moved` → `list_documents`); the list
  border-title shows `# <tag>` (plus `· /<search>` when a `/` search is ANDed on).
- **Themes are user-extensible** (`soap/tui/themes.py`). `BUNDLED_THEMES` ships
  aqua-slate (default) + one-dark + catppuccin-mocha; `load_user_themes` discovers
  `$SOAP_DIR/themes/*.yaml` (YAML, matching `soap/config.py`) and degrades gracefully
  on a broken file (skip + warn, never crash). The startup theme is the `theme:` key
  in `config.yaml`; `SoapApp` persists any runtime switch back via
  `soap.config.save_theme`. Format + example: `docs/themes.md`, `docs/example-theme.yaml`.
- **Testing:** `uv run pytest`. TUI is covered with Textual's pilot via `asyncio.run`
  (`tests/test_tui_review.py`, `tests/test_themes.py`) — no pytest-asyncio plugin.

- **Packaging:** PyPI dist name is **`soap-tui`** (plain `soap` is taken) but the
  installed command stays **`soap`** via `[project.scripts]` — never conflate them.
  Version is **dynamic via hatch-vcs** from `v*` git tags, written to the gitignored
  `soap/_version.py` at build time; no tag → a `0.1.devN+...` version (expected).
  `soap --version` (`soap/main.py`) resolves `importlib.metadata.version("soap-tui")`
  then falls back to `soap/_version.py` then `"0.0.0+unknown"`. Build/verify with
  `uv build` (emits `soap_tui-*` wheel + sdist).

- **Release CI:** `.github/workflows/release.yml` fires on a `v*` tag push (or
  `workflow_dispatch` for a build-only dry run). It first reuses the required checks
  from `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, then builds PyApp standalone binaries across 3
  native runners (macOS arm64 + Linux x86_64/arm64 — no Windows, no signing),
  publishes to PyPI via **Trusted Publishing** (`pypi` environment, OIDC, no tokens),
  and cuts a GitHub Release. Actions and toolchain/build inputs are pinned in the
  workflows; the publish/release jobs are tag-gated (skipped on dispatch).
  PyApp knobs, the one-time PyPI pending-publisher setup, and the captain-gated
  public steps are documented in `docs/releasing.md`. The frozen TUI is smoke-tested
  under a pty by `scripts/tui_smoke.py`.

- **Homebrew distribution:** the public tap is a SEPARATE repo,
  `GhifariArsa/homebrew-soap` (`brew install GhifariArsa/soap/soap-tui`). Its
  `Formula/soap-tui.rb` is a **binary** formula — downloads the prebuilt release
  binaries, no Python/source build — with per-platform `on_macos`/`on_linux` +
  `on_arm`/`on_intel` `url`/`sha256` pairs and NO `version` stanza (Homebrew
  scans it from the URL; adding one fails `brew audit`). There is deliberately no
  Intel-macOS binary, so the Intel-mac branch `odie`s. The `homebrew-bump` job in
  `release.yml` keeps it current: it runs `scripts/bump_homebrew_formula.py`
  (stdlib-only regex rewrite of the three url/sha256 pairs from the release
  `checksums.txt` — NOT `brew bump-formula-pr`, which can't model the multi-block
  binary formula) and pushes to the tap using the `HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN` repo secret
  (fine-grained PAT, Contents:rw on the tap; job no-ops if unset). Setup +
  rationale: `docs/releasing.md`; regression coverage in `tests/test_ci_workflows.py`
  + `tests/test_bump_homebrew.py`.

- **Self-update:** `soap self update` is OUR Typer subcommand (PyApp's `self` group is
  off via `PYAPP_SELF_COMMAND=none`), all in `soap/cli/selfupdate.py`, wired in
  `soap/main.py` as `app.add_typer(selfupdate.app, name="self")`. `detect_channel`
  no-ops with an upgrade-command pointer for brew/pipx/uv-tool/pip and only swaps the
  binary channel; the swap resolves the launcher via OS self-exe (NOT `sys.executable`),
  verifies sha256 against the release `checksums.txt`, and `os.replace`s a same-dir temp.
  Windows is a marked future path (`perform_update` refuses). `maybe_nudge` (called from
  `main.py` for non-`self` subcommands) is the 24h-cached, offline-safe startup hint.
  `current_version()` is the single version resolver `soap --version` also uses. Every
  network/IO seam is injectable → `tests/test_selfupdate.py` mocks it all (no real net).
