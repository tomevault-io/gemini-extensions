# LibreEcho Product Repository — Agent Instructions

This repository is the product and release home for LibreEcho: landing content,
cross-repository public documentation, release notes, and release tooling. Read
`CONTRIBUTING.md` for change-ownership routing before non-trivial work.

## Agent operating contract

These rules govern normal task execution, subject to higher-priority system and
developer instructions and the repository/workspace safety boundaries below.

1. The user's current request defines the intended scope. A request to fix,
   implement, or update explicitly authorizes reversible local preparation in
   that scope: create or use a purpose-named branch/worktree, investigate the
   necessary in-scope files, make the required edits, create local commits, and
   run appropriate validation. Do not stop merely because the work needs more
   in-scope files than first expected; expected file count is not a boundary.

2. Work only on the named problem and the files needed to solve it. Do not fix
   adjacent bugs, refactor nearby code, clean up unrelated issues, or improve
   the architecture unless asked. Preserve unrelated dirty changes and other
   worktrees; do not reset, stash, clean, switch, delete, or absorb them merely
   to make the requested task convenient.

3. Before editing, identify the requested outcome, likely files, and validation
   needed to establish it. Ask before a material scope expansion, destructive or
   irreversible operation, or unresolved decision; first complete independent
   authorized work that does not depend on that decision.

4. Reviews, diagnoses, explanations, and plans do not authorize project-file
   edits unless the user explicitly asks for edits. Publication, push, pull
   request creation, merge, release/tagging, deployment, flashing, rebooting,
   and other hardware-changing actions remain separate explicit gates.

5. Every command must have a bounded timeout. Bounded background work,
   watchers, or servers are permitted only when needed for the authorized
   outcome; define their scope and timeout, capture their result, and stop and
   clean them up on completion or timeout. Do not retry indefinitely.

6. Run focused, meaningful checks that establish every acceptance criterion and
   all applicable repository-required checks. Do not impose a one-test limit or
   a blanket aggregate-suite requirement: broaden or repeat validation when
   changed paths, failures, required checks, or unresolved risk justify it. If
   authorized PR publication is part of the workflow, required CI must complete
   and be green on the exact head; otherwise do not poll remote CI unprompted.
   Keep host, CI, image/release, and hardware evidence distinct. Stop when every
   acceptance criterion is evidenced and required checks pass. Report unrelated
   failures and whether they block acceptance; do not fix them silently. Avoid
   tests that merely mirror reversible, low-impact implementation details.

7. Subject to higher-priority system/developer instructions and explicit
   project safety boundaries, the current request takes precedence over
   procedural defaults in skills or later non-safety guidance. If an instruction
   blocks completion, identify its exact source file and section, quote the
   exact blocking rule, explain the conflict, and complete independent
   authorized work rather than silently abandoning it.

8. Delegate independent, bounded research, review, or test analysis when tools
   support it and delegation improves speed or quality. Give each delegate
   disjoint write ownership or read-only work; never permit shared writes, and
   verify delegated findings before reporting success. Do not require recursive
   delegation when the harness does not support it.

9. Use concise plain language. Give brief progress updates during long tasks;
   report results first, with exact evidence and remaining blockers at a
   proportionate level of detail.

# Branching, Pull Requests, and Versioning

These rules govern how changes flow through this repository. They apply equally
to human contributors and AI coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, Hermes, Cursor,
Copilot, and any similar tool). Repository-specific build, test, and safety
rules elsewhere in this repository remain in force unchanged; this section
governs branch, PR, and release flow only.

## Branch model

```text
feature/<purpose>   fix/<issue-or-purpose>
       |                   |
       | PR                | PR
       v                   v
release/X.Y.0        release/X.Y.Z
 (major release)      (minor release)
       \______  _________/
               v
              main         (release branch merges back when release-ready)
```

- `main` is the integration branch. Nothing is committed directly to `main` or
  to any `release/*` branch; every change lands through a pull request.
- **Features** start from the current `main` (or from the active release branch
  when the feature is scoped to that release) on a branch named
  `feature/<short-purpose>` and merge into the next **major release branch**,
  `release/X.(Y+1).0` (for example `release/0.14.0`).
- **Fixes** follow the same flow and merge into the corresponding **minor
  release branch**, `release/X.Y.(Z+1)` (for example `release/0.13.8`).
- Because the current line is pre-1.0 (`0.Y.Z`), a `Y` bump is a *major*
  product release and a `Z` bump is a *minor* (fix) release; this is the
  terminology used for release branches throughout. In SemVer terms a `Y`
  bump is a MINOR bump and a `Z` bump is a PATCH bump. The `Release impact:`
  label always uses SemVer terms: a pre-1.0 product major release (`Y` bump)
  is `Release impact: minor`, and a pre-1.0 product minor release (`Z` bump)
  is `Release impact: patch`.
- A release branch is cut from `main`, receives its features and fixes by PR,
  and merges back into `main` when it is validated and release-ready.
- If the release branch for a fix already exists, base the fix PR on that
  release branch rather than on `main`. If a fix was merged into `main`
  before the release branch was cut, carry it over by cherry-picking the
  merged commit onto a new `fix/<purpose>` branch cut from the release
  branch and opening a PR against the release branch that references the
  original PR; never push directly to a release branch and never hand-edit a
  divergent copy.
- After a release merges to `main`, subsequent work starts from `main` again.
  A new release branch is cut for the next release; release branches are not
  reused or revived.

Branch name prefixes: `feature/` (new capability), `fix/` (bug fix),
`release/` (release branches only), `docs/` (documentation-only). Other
prefixes require maintainer agreement.

## Pull request rules (strict)

1. One focused change per PR. No unrelated edits, reformatting, dependency
   bumps, or drive-by refactors in the same PR.
2. PR title uses Conventional Commit format: `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`,
   `docs:`, `test:`, or `refactor:` followed by an imperative summary.
3. PR base must be the correct release branch (or `main` only when no release
   branch is open for that change class). Retarget rather than merge into the
   wrong base.
4. Every PR body must state, before review is requested:
   - Summary and, for fixes, the root cause.
   - Changed files and why each is touched.
   - Testing and evidence: exact commands run and results, distinguishing
     source/host/CI evidence from image and real-hardware evidence. Never
     claim a validation class that was not actually performed.
   - `Release impact: none | patch | minor | major`
   - `Release note: one user-facing sentence, or none`
   - Linked issue, when one exists.
5. Behavioral changes require a regression test wired into the repository's
   real test runner. Do not weaken, skip, or delete tests to make CI pass.
6. CI must be green on the exact current head. After any push, wait for the
   new CI run to complete before requesting review or merging; a stale green
   run does not count. If the changed files match no workflow trigger (for
   example a documentation-only PR), the head has no applicable CI: state
   that explicitly in the PR evidence instead of waiting for a run that will
   never start, and every check that does run must still be green.
7. Review closure: at least one approving review is required. Automated agent
   reviews (e.g. Codex) must be addressed against the exact current head: fix
   or disprove every actionable finding with evidence, reply to each thread
   with the fixing commit or the reason it does not apply, and only then
   resolve the thread.
8. No force-push or history rewrite on a branch under review. Add fixup
   commits instead; never amend away reviewed history.
9. Merging is a separate, explicit authorization. Green CI, `MERGEABLE` state,
   or agent approval is not merge authorization on its own. Use merge commits
   so branch history stays auditable.
10. Never include secrets, Wi-Fi configuration, device serials, MAC addresses,
    tokens, private paths, or private manifests in branch content, PR bodies,
    or comments.
11. Cross-repository changes get one linked PR per owning repository, all
    targeting the same release version, coordinated from a product issue in
    the LibreEcho product repository.

## Versioning (one version across all repositories)

- LibreEcho uses a single product-wide SemVer version `X.Y.Z`. The canonical
  public identity is the product release `radar-puffin-vX.Y.Z`, tagged in the
  LibreEcho product repository.
- All repositories (product, build, platform/kernel tooling, Linux kernel,
  UI) participate in the same version for a given release. No repository
  publishes or documents a divergent version number.
- Release branches are named `release/X.Y.Z` with all three components,
  exactly matching the intended product tag suffix (for example
  `release/0.14.0` or `release/0.13.8`).
- Where a repository carries a machine-readable version marker (for example
  LibreEcho-UI `VERSION`), its value must equal the numeric release version
  included in the image; the release gate fails closed on mismatch.
- Bump rules:
  - `major` (X): intentional incompatible contract or migration (OTA protocol,
    data/config migration, partition/boot contract, unsupported rollback).
  - `minor` (Y): new backward-compatible capability, service, payload, or
    additive API/UI contract; reset Z to 0.
  - `patch` (Z): backward-compatible bug, reliability, packaging, or security
    fix that changes the shipped artifact.
  - `none`: tests, CI-only, internal refactor, or unshipped documentation.
    Such PRs may merge without entering release notes.
- Never reuse a published version for different source or artifact identities.
  A rebuilt candidate after publication needs a new version (normally the next
  patch). Do not use a channel name (`dev`/`stable`) as a version substitute.
- At release cut, the included-fix ledger is collected from the exact component
  commits between the previous release and the release heads of all
  repositories; release notes are generated from that ledger, not from branch
  names or memory.

## AI agent rules

- Before editing, read this file, the relevant part of `README.md`, and any
  directly applicable `CONTRIBUTING.md`; do not recursively inspect unrelated
  documentation or historical source.
- Re-read the live branch, status, and diff before making changes.
- For an authorized edit, create or use an isolated purpose-named branch
  based on the current base selected by the branch policy above.
- Run meaningful focused checks and all applicable required checks under
  the operating contract above; broaden only when justified.
- Report exact commands and results. Do not claim image, CI, or hardware
  evidence when only host-source checks were run.
- Record the exact commit SHA that was tested; the PR head must equal the
  tested head at merge time.
- Do not merge, push to protected branches, tag releases, or perform hardware
  actions without explicit human authorization for that specific step.
