# BoardRipper — Project Configuration

## Project Overview
BoardRipper — web-based PCB boardview file viewer and inspector. Hosted via Docker on NAS.

## License
AGPL-3.0. See [LICENSE](LICENSE) and [THIRD_PARTY.md](THIRD_PARTY.md). AGPL was
chosen because the Allegro parser (`src/frontend/src/parsers/allegro/`) is a
TypeScript re-implementation derived from KiCad (GPL-3.0), which forces the
whole project to be GPL-3.0-compatible. AGPL additionally closes the SaaS
loophole. All other parsers (BVR/BRD/BDV/FZ/CAD/XZZ) draw from OpenBoardView
(MIT); TVW draws from eagleview (MIT). All runtime dependencies are
MIT/Apache-2.0/BSD.

## Key Architectural Decisions
- PixiJS v8 chosen over Canvas2D/Konva for GPU-accelerated rendering of 10,000+ components at 60fps
- `buildBoardScene()` in `renderer/board-scene.ts` is a shared pure function used by both `BoardRenderer` and `SettingsMockup` — visual changes propagate to both automatically
- BitmapText atlases for part/pin labels: dramatically fewer GPU draw calls vs per-label canvas Text objects
- Dockview chosen for IDE-like panel system with floating/popout window support
- Go backend chosen for minimal Docker footprint and single-binary deployment
- All format parsing happens client-side in TypeScript (no server dependency for rendering)
- `useSyncExternalStore` for reactive stores — getSnapshot must return a stable cached reference
- **NEVER call `app.destroy()` on PixiJS v8 Applications** — `destroy()` triggers `GlobalResourceRegistry.clear()` which corrupts the module-level `batchPool` in `Batcher.mjs`, permanently breaking ALL other Application instances with `_DefaultBatcher2.break: Cannot read properties of null`. Instead, just remove the canvas from DOM and let GC reclaim the Application + WebGL context. See `BoardRenderer.teardownForReinit()`.
- **NEVER `BitmapFont.uninstall()` on per-tab teardown.** `BitmapFont.install()` registers atlases in PixiJS's **global** registry — one atlas is shared by every open tab's `BitmapText`. Uninstalling on tab close / scene rebuild destroys the `TextureStyle` still referenced by other tabs, which later crashes in `GlTextureSystem.updateStyle → applyStyleParams` with `Cannot read properties of null (reading 'addressModeU')`. Atlases are content-keyed (`board-shadow-N-v3`, `board-pin-N`), idempotent, and safe to keep for the app lifetime.
- PDF panels use per-document state via `usePdfDoc(fileName)` hook, allowing multiple PDFs to render side-by-side. The singleton `pdfStore` tracks an "active" doc for mutations but each panel reads its own doc's state independently.
- **PDF render pipeline:** see [docs/PDF_VIEWER.md](docs/PDF_VIEWER.md) for the full architecture. Short summary: at zoom ≤ 1.05 a full-page path renders the current page to an `ImageBitmap` cache keyed by `(file, page, tier, cleanMode)`; above that a per-tile DOM-canvas path (`tile-manager.ts`) renders 1024×1024 tiles with an LRU cache keyed by `(file, page, col, row, scale)`. Both paths flow through `mainTierFromZoom → quantiseTier → hysteresisFilter → clampCanvasScale` before calling `page.render()`. A separate tier-1 preview cache provides instant backdrop on zoom/page transitions. Adjacent pages use `renderPageToBitmap` (capped at `maxAdjTier`). Quality presets in `QUALITY_CONFIGS` control tier caps, cache budgets, and settle delays.
- **PDF watermark filter (v0.30.3+):** parse-time string-matching filter implemented as a pdf.js patch in `src/frontend/patches/pdfjs-dist+<version>.patch`, applied by `patch-package` via the `postinstall` script. The patched worker examines each `showText` op's reconstructed glyph string against terms forwarded through a custom `watermarkFilter` render option and skips matching ops **before they enter the operator list**. Net effect: 5–10k watermark glyph runs per page never tokenised, streamed, or allocated; zero client-side callback overhead. Matching rule (NFKC-normalise → strip whitespace → lowercase → substring; NFKC decomposes ligatures like `ﬁ` so `"Vinaﬁx.com"` matches `"Vinafix"`) is kept in lock-step with `isPdfWatermarkText`/`normalizeForWatermark` in `render-settings.ts` (and `IsWatermark` in `pdfindex/watermark.go`, which imports `golang.org/x/text/unicode/norm`) so click-test and render-skip stay aligned by construction. Worker URL in `pdf-store.ts` points at the **unminified** `pdf.worker.mjs` because the patch targets readable source (Vite still minifies for prod). The earlier `operationsFilter`-callback approach (v0.4.2 – v0.30.2) was retired because pdf.js's `QueueOptimizer` reorders/merges ops between `getOperatorList` and `render`, so pre-computed indices didn't line up with what `render` actually executed on PDFs heavy enough to trigger the optimizer. See `src/frontend/patches/README.md` for the five-site edit recipe and the procedure to re-port the patch on `pdfjs-dist` version bumps.
- **PDF canvas rules:** Only **pooled offscreen** canvases (freshly acquired, used once, released) use `getContext('2d', { alpha: false })`. Persistent canvases (main visible canvas, adjacent page canvases, tile canvases) must NOT use `alpha: false` — resetting `canvas.width` doesn't reliably reset the alpha attribute across browsers, causing mirroring artifacts on reused canvases. Canvas pool (8 entries) shrinks backing store synchronously before pooling — never defer shrinking (race condition with reuse). Highlight, glyph, and tile canvases retain alpha.
- **Never pool pdf.js-rendered canvases.** After `page.render()` completes, the pdf.js Worker thread may still queue stale draw operations. Abandon the offscreen canvas to GC by setting `width = 1; height = 1` — do NOT return it to the canvas pool, or subsequent reuses will be corrupted with mirrored/flipped content.
- **Scroll modifier zoom speeds:** Both BoardViewer and PDF viewer support modifier-dependent zoom speeds: Shift+Scroll = slow zoom (precise), Ctrl+Scroll = fast zoom (coarse), trackpad pinch = direct proportional zoom. Ctrl and Cmd are **distinct keys** even on Mac — browsers emit `ctrlKey=true` wheel events for both physical Ctrl+Scroll and trackpad pinch, but the pinch gesture produces small deltaY values that map to proportional zoom, while Ctrl+mouse-wheel produces large deltaY steps. pixi-viewport natively lacks shift-key awareness, so `BoardRenderer.installShiftWheelHandler()` intercepts Shift+Scroll in capture phase. The speed difference comes from divisor constants: `/500` (shift, slow) vs `/200` (ctrl+wheel, fast). Do not unify these — the two-speed zoom is a deliberate feature.
- **PDF rotation + mirror + page modes:** Per-document `rotation` (0/90/180/270 CW), `mirror` (horizontal flip), and `pageMode` (`single` | `continuous`, default continuous) live in `pdf-store` (`PdfDocument`). **Rotation** is applied by passing `rotation: page.rotate + userRotation` to **every** `page.getViewport()` call in `PdfViewerPanel` (full-page, tiled, and adjacent paths) — pdf.js then swaps page dims for 90/270 so fit-width, `cssH`, the highlight/click transform (`viewportTransformRef`) and tile grid all adapt for free. Rotation does NOT key the bitmap/tile caches; instead a rotation-change effect clears `invalidatePageCache`/`invalidateTileCache` + adjacent canvases and re-fits (rotation is rare and deliberate). **Mirror** is a CSS `scaleX(-1)` baked into the wrapper transform by `applyTransform` (innermost, flipping around the committed-zoom content width via the `mirrorWidth()` helper) so the whole wrapper — page, tiles, highlight, overlays — flips together in all modes (full-page/tiled/continuous) with no cache or render changes; the only X-coordinate consumers that compensate are `hitTestWord` (`clickX = clientW - clickX`) and the two match-centering pans (`pan.x = clientW*(1-zoom) - pan.x`). Mirror is independent of rotation/page-mode and composes with both. **Effective single-page** (`pdfStore.isDocSinglePage`) = explicit single mode OR `rotation !== 0` — rotation forces single but **preserves** the user's `pageMode` so un-rotating restores continuous. Single-page = no adjacent-page rendering, no scroll/zoom page-flip (gated by `noFlip` in `handleWheel`), pan clamped to the current page (the `singlePage` branch in `clampPan`). Continuous = the original stacked-adjacent-pages + boundary-flip behaviour. Toolbar: the `pdf-rotate` (cycles CW) + `pdf-mirror` (toggle) + `pdf-page-mode` (toggle, disabled while rotated) group sits directly **right of the page-switching controls**. Shortcuts (PDF panel active): `rotateBoardCW/CCW` (Q/E) and `rotateCW/CCW` (⌘←/→) rotate; `mirrorBoard` (⌘↑) mirrors — all previously no-op on PDF. E2E: `tests/pdf-rotation.spec.ts`.
- **Secure update pipeline (v0.19.0+):** Releases are signed offline by the maintainer (Ed25519/minisign); the running container's compiled-in `PubKey` (set via Docker build-arg `PUBKEY` → ldflags, **no env/file override**) verifies every manifest before any I/O on its body. Two delivery sources walked in order — `ghcr.io/alexeyinwerp/boardripper` (pull-by-digest) and `https://www.ripperdoc.de/boardripper/` (signed-tarball mirror with sha256 verification) — first source whose signature verifies wins. Manifest schema includes monotonic `counter` (replay defence), `released_at` + `not_after` (30-day freshness window + 90-day expiry — see freshness invariants below), `min_supported_version` (downgrade defence), `important` flag (red-banner UX) + `important_reason` + `notes_url`, image registry/tag/digest, tarball sha256 + `size_bytes`, and `orchestrator_image_digest` (the multi-arch INDEX digest of the alpine container that swaps the running image). `/api/update/*` is gated by a per-install 32-byte secret persisted at `/data/.update-secret` (mode 0600); the install's monotonic counter persists alongside at `/data/.update-counter`. Cookie attributes: HttpOnly + SameSite=Strict + conditional Secure based on request scheme. Healthcheck-based rollback: orchestrator polls the new container's IP-resolved `/api/health` for 60 s and reverts on failure. The previous image is tagged `boardripper:previous` before swap so a manual rollback is one `docker run` away. Drop-to-update bundle (`POST /api/update/apply-bundle`) is the recovery escape-hatch — a signed-manifest+tarball single file the user can drag onto the window when GHCR + ripperdoc.de are both unreachable. Same trust envelope as the network path. **Operational invariants:** download timeout 10 min, body cap = manifest's `size_bytes` (or 1 GiB fallback), `released_at` rejection bounds [now − 30d, now + 24h], single-flight gate prevents concurrent `Apply` / `ApplyBundle`. See `docs/RELEASE_RUNBOOK.md`.
- **Theme stack (v0.18.0+):** themes split into board-side concerns (the `THEMES` registry — pin/part/background colours used by `buildBoardScene`) and three independent interface knobs persisted separately by `themeStore`: `accent`, `background`, `chrome`. Boards adopt the theme; UI chrome obeys the knobs. Auto-flip of accent text colour is computed against perceived brightness (don't hardcode contrast pairs). User-pickable accent presets (BoardRipper default + ATARI palette) live in `themes.ts`.
- **Board overlay slot system (v0.18.0+):** the floating in-canvas controls (top/bottom toggle, flip-axis, spotlight tri-state dim, parts/nets filters, separators, selection-name label) render via a slot registry under `components/overlay/`. Layout is persisted (`overlay-layout.ts`) and reconciled against `DEFAULT_OVERLAY_LAYOUT` on load — new slots auto-append with `def.visible`, removed slots drop. Settings ▸ Board overlay edits the layout via drag-and-drop. Default position is left; the overlay is mounted as a `netDimGfx` sibling so highlight blending pattern works.
- **Boards reference database v2 (v0.15.0+):** `Board Database/boards.db` is a SQLite reference DB shipped inside the container image (copied to `/boards.db`; the backend prefers `<DATA_DIR>/boards.db` when present). v2 schema replaces the old flat board table with an entity hierarchy (Brand → Family → Board), color cascade, and explicit family field. Resolver lives in `src/backend/boarddb/`. Imported sources include Wikidata Macs, XZZ Apple-laptop filenames, and an LLM-classified NAS dump (~3,977 boards in the shipped DB). The Database Editor panel surfaces it read-only.
- **Library sync (v0.16.11+):** `src/backend/librarysync/` pulls a remote WebDAV mirror into a local library mount on a schedule, with diff-then-fetch semantics, sync-error surfacing in the UI, and zero-byte-file skip. Configured via Settings ▸ Library. Scoped log: `log.scan.*`.
- **OpenBoardData (OBD) integration (v0.16.7+):** `src/backend/obd/` parses the public OBDATA_V002 corpus, caches per-board entries at `<dataDir>/obd/` (always writable across container updates; pre-v0.20.3 was rooted at the typically-read-only library mount and silently lost the cache on every restart), uses atomic writes + bpath sandbox, and exposes four HTTP handlers behind `/api/obd/*` with single-flight + drop-guard. Legacy caches at `<libRoot>/.boardripper/openboarddata/` are auto-migrated on first boot via `obd.MigrateLegacyCache` (skipped on cross-volume rename — user re-syncs once). Frontend renders a structured DIAGNOSIS section (collapsible blocks, clickable refs, multi-variant table) in LibraryPanel and surfaces readings in the canvas tooltip + Info pane. Scoped log: `log.obd.*`.
- **PDF text index (backend pdfium/wazero, FTS5):** PDF full-text search is powered by a backend pdfium/wazero indexer that writes a separate `pdfindex.db` (SQLite FTS5 external-content, porter+prefix tokenizer); donors are a `pdf_donors` membership list in `databank.db`. On PDF open, a pdf.js on-open fast-path in `pdf-index-client.ts` (`ensureIndexed`) uploads the client-extracted text so the active file is searchable immediately. The scratch image embeds a ~5 MB `pdfium.wasm` blob; container memory floor is raised to 1 GB. See `docs/PDF_VIEWER.md#pdf-text-index` for full API, state machine, watermark lock-step, and Ctrl-F invariant.
- **Library content deduplication:** non-destructive layer that extracts each byte-identical file once and collapses copies in content-oriented views. Detection is size-bucket + sampled hash (`databank/dedup.go`): a unique byte size can't be a duplicate so it's never read (`files.content_hash` stays `NULL`); size-collision files get `sha256(size ‖ full-file if ≤192 KiB else head/mid/tail 64 KiB)`. A content group = files sharing a non-`NULL` `content_hash`; canonical = `MIN(id)`. The on-demand `DedupRunner` ("Find duplicates" in Settings ▸ Database info, `/api/databank/dedup/*`) hashes only size-collision candidates and is idempotent (the scanner clears `content_hash` on size/mod_time change). The PDF indexer marks non-canonical duplicates `status='duplicate'` + `canonical_file_id` and skips extraction — only the canonical is indexed. Folder views (DB + Live) show every file at its real path; Board#/Model + PDF Search collapse via `content_hash` (`collapseByContent`, `copies[]`). See `docs/PDF_VIEWER.md#content-deduplication`.
- **Cloud-storage-aware file serving (v0.20.4+):** the two cloud-exposed file-serve handlers (`files.Get` and `files.GetByPath`; `databank.PreviewGet` continues to use `http.ServeFile` since previews live in the always-local `<dataDir>/.previews/`) read files fully into memory via `serveFileEager` (`src/backend/handlers/serve.go`) and verify byte count matches `stat().Size()` before writing the response. Truncated reads from cloud-sync placeholders (Google Drive on macOS File Provider, OneDrive on Windows NTFS reparse points, iCloud, Dropbox) produce a 503 with `Retry-After: 5` instead of corrupt bytes; the 30s read deadline produces 503 with `Retry-After: 10`; an `EDEADLK` on read (Docker bind-mount can't drive host-side materialization) produces 503 with `Retry-After: 60` and an actionable body. Every error response carries `X-Boardripper-Cloud-Error: <code>` (`edeadlk` / `deadline` / `short-read` / `read-error:<errno>` / `open-failed:<errno>` / `not-found` / `is-dir` / `too-large`) so the frontend can switch on the code without parsing free-form bodies. `st_blocks` is logged in every error branch alongside size/elapsed/bytes_read for diagnosis (placeholder signal = `size>0 && blocks==0`) but is NOT used for gating — see commit `4b9c722` for why. Frontend `fetchWithCloudRetry` (`src/frontend/src/store/fetch-with-cloud-retry.ts`) retries up to 6 attempts / 3 min, logs every attempt to `log.cloud`, surfaces a "Downloading from cloud storage…" toast on retry, and on exhaustion uses `formatCloudErrorToast()` which switches on the cloud-error code and incorporates the backend body so the user sees actionable text (e.g. "materialize on host first" for `edeadlk`). Diagnostic endpoint: `GET /api/files/probe?path=<libpath>` runs a 5 s probe read and returns `{size, blocks, blocks_known, placeholder_signal, probe: {ok, bytes_read, errno, error, elapsed_ms, timed_out}}`. Trade-offs: loses range-request and ETag support (no consumer needed them); 512 MiB cap on in-memory reads. Scoped log: `log.cloud.*`.

- **MCP server + live-board bridge (feature/mcp-server-live-board-bridge):** BoardRipper exposes a standards-compliant Streamable-HTTP MCP server (official `github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk` v1.6.1) at `/api/mcp`, **off by default**, enabled in Settings ▸ Integrations (config keys `mcp_enabled` / `mcp_drive_ui`). Bearer-token gated by a per-install `<dataDir>/.mcp-secret` (mirrors `updater.EnsureSecret`); returns 404 when disabled so it's invisible. Package `src/backend/mcpserver/`. **Backend-native tools** (`pdf_search`, `obd_match`, `obd_data`, `board_resolve`, `file_list`, `file_get`) answer directly against the existing SQLite stores and mirror the matching `/api/*` endpoints exactly. **Live-board tools** (`board_active`, `board_sessions`, `list_nets`, `list_parts`, `net_info`, `net_neighbors`, `pin_connectivity`, `part_info`) + **drive-UI tools** (`highlight_net`, `clear_highlight`, `select_part`, `set_side`, `pdf_goto`) are proxied over a `coder/websocket` bridge (`/api/mcp/bridge`) to the focused browser page, which answers from in-memory `BoardData` (reusing `computeAdjacentNets`) or drives existing stores (`src/frontend/src/store/mcp-bridge.ts`). Bridge picks the most-recently-focused page; every live tool accepts an optional `session` (list via `board_sessions`). Drive-UI tools are always registered but **gated per-call** on `mcp_drive_ui` (so the toggle takes effect without restart) and each emits an info toast + `log.mcp` entry. The SDK requires every tool's output schema to be a JSON **object** — array results must be wrapped (`{files,total}`, `{sessions}`) and live results decode into `map[string]any`. Connect: `claude mcp add --transport http boardripper http://<host>:1336/api/mcp --header "Authorization: Bearer <token>"`. Sub-project B (in-browser copilot panel consuming these tools) is a separate future spec. Specs: `docs/specs/2026-06-15-mcp-server-live-board-bridge-design.md`, plan `docs/plans/2026-06-15-mcp-server-live-board-bridge-plan.md`. Scoped log: `log.mcp.*`.

## Safety Rules
- **COMMIT before removing code.** Before deleting or replacing any significant block of code (>10 lines), commit the current working state first. A stray `git checkout` must never destroy hours of work.
- **COMMIT at milestones.** When a feature, phase, or significant progress is complete and building, commit immediately — don't accumulate uncommitted work.

## Conventions
- TypeScript strict mode
- All coordinates internally in mils (thousandths of an inch)
- Component naming: PascalCase for React components, camelCase for functions/variables
- File format parsers are pure functions: `(buffer: ArrayBuffer) => BoardData | Promise<BoardData>` (see `FormatDescriptor.parse` in `parsers/registry.ts`)
- **Logging:** Use scoped loggers from `store/log-store.ts` — never raw `console.log`. Import `{ log }` and use `log.parser.*`, `log.render.*`, `log.pdf.*`, `log.scan.*`, `log.ui.*`, `log.cache.*`, `log.perf.*`, `log.update.*`, `log.obd.*`, `log.cloud.*`. The Debug Panel filters by scope. Avoid logging in hot paths (per-frame, per-pointer-move).

## Public landing page (`landing/`)
The `landing/` folder owns the static page served at <https://www.ripperdoc.de/boardripper/>. It is plain HTML5 with embedded CSS — no JS, no build step, not part of any application build. To update the page (new feature, new screenshot, format-table change): edit `landing/index.html` directly and replace screenshots in `landing/screenshots/`. The RipperDocWeb deploy script rsyncs this folder; nothing in this repo's build pipeline is involved. See `landing/README.md` for the full update workflow.
