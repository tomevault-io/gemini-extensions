# CLAUDE.md

Operational guide for working in this repo. For what the project *is* (the thesis, the document structure, the routes), read [README.md](README.md). This file is the conventions and gotchas that keep it from breaking.

## Standalone repo (hard rule)

This repository is self-contained and public. Do **not** add references to any other, sibling, or private repository: not by relative path (e.g. `../other-repo/...`), not by project name, and not in commit messages. If you need a concept that lives in another project, describe it inline here instead of linking to or naming the source. The git history was scrubbed of such references before this repo went public; keep it that way.

## House style (load-bearing)

- **No em-dashes.** The house style forbids the em-dash and the en-dash used as punctuation. Use commas, colons, parentheses, or restructure the sentence. This applies to content, code comments, and commit messages alike. Curly/smart quotes are also out; use straight quotes. Before committing, grep the changed files for the em-dash character (U+2014) and curly quotes.
- **Commit messages**: lowercase, colon-prefixed by area (`site:`, `content:`, `docs:`, `scorecard:`, `proposal:`), imperative mood, body wrapped. End with the `Co-Authored-By:` trailer when co-authored. Commit and push only when asked; the repo is maintained directly on `main`.
- **Voice**: the copy is confessional, direct, terminal/mono in feel (Geist Mono, the void / brake-red palette). Match the surrounding text; do not turn it into marketing.

## Content pipelines (know which one you are in)

- **Policy paper and appendix.** `content/proposal.md` and `content/notes.md` are the frontmatter-stripped *bodies* of the review copies in `docs/proposals/`. Edit the review copy, then regenerate the body. Do not add nav links or frontmatter to `content/*.md` (react-markdown renders them raw).
- **Lawsuits and hearings are ledger-first.** `docs/distillations/*.md` are the evidence-tiered claim ledgers and are the source of truth. `content/lawsuits/*.md` (the case files), `content/lawsuits.md` (the hub), and `content/hearings.md` (the hearings hub) are *seeded from* the ledgers, curated, not a 1:1 render. Corrections land in the ledger first (verified against a primary source), then the page is re-seeded on a dated pass. Never fix a fact only on the page.
- **The ledgers are also published directly.** `/distillations/<slug>` (plus a raw `/distillations/<slug>.md` per ledger, and inclusion in `/llms-full.txt`) renders each ledger via the section whitelist in `src/lib/distillations.ts`: reader summary, brake-integrity relevance, the tiered claims, the full quote-bank, tensions, plus Sources rebuilt from frontmatter and the lawsuit ledgers' own Tier key paragraph. The TLDR block, Discrepancies, and Coverage note stay out (authoring/QA scaffolding). So a ledger correction publishes to `/distillations` automatically with no re-seed; only the curated pages need the dated pass. New ledgers must be registered in the `DISTILLATIONS` list in that lib file.
- **Verbatim TLDR surfaces.** Each ledger has a TLDR block (label / search-snippet / one-sentence / one-paragraph). Those exact strings are wired verbatim into consumers: label -> hub card, search-snippet -> meta description, one-sentence -> JSON-LD description, one-paragraph -> page opener. The `/distillations` pages consume search-snippet and one-sentence the same way, parsed at build by `src/lib/distillations.ts`. Copy verbatim; do not hand-adapt a summary (an adapted copy is a third unvalidated variant and reopens drift). If a consumer needs a length the ledger lacks, add that budgeted variant to the ledger, not to the page.
- **Hand-built React** (not markdown): the homepage, `/report`, `/scorecard`, `/for`, `/remixes`, and `/distillations` (which renders the ledgers).

## Evidence discipline (this is a public legal site)

- A legal or factual claim must trace to a **primary source** (a court order or filing, the docket, an official government release) to be stated as fact. Secondary coverage gets tiered down and flagged.
- **Posture precision.** "Announced intent" is not "filed" is not "affirmed"; a summary-judgment ruling is not a motion to dismiss; a jury verdict is not "upheld on appeal." The project was burned once by a "$6M upheld on appeal" error; do not repeat that class.
- **Event date is not coverage date.** An order "filed June 29" may be "announced June 30"; record the event date, note the coverage date. This error recurred repeatedly, so watch for it.
- Everything carries an **as-of date**. Figures date quickly.

## Adding or changing a route

Wire it into every discovery surface or it drifts out of sync:

- `src/app/sitemap.ts`, `src/app/llms.txt/route.ts`, `src/app/llms-full.txt/route.ts`, and the `_links` (plus a `skill` where it fits) in `src/app/agent-card.json/route.ts`. `_actions` in the agent card is capped at five, so extend `_links`, not `_actions`. A rendered document also gets a raw-markdown route (e.g. `/hearings.md`, `/distillations/<slug>.md`) with RFC 8288 `Link` headers (`up` / `index` / `canonical`), and is listed in llms.txt.
- If it is a content page: add `Article` + `BreadcrumbList` JSON-LD and **per-page `openGraph` / `twitter`** metadata. The OG image is a **colocated `opengraph-image.tsx`** in the route folder (it calls the shared `ogCard` in `src/lib/og/template.tsx`, brake or signal accent); Next wires it into `og:image` automatically, so the per-page `openGraph` object does **not** set `images`. A dynamic route generates one OG per param via `generateStaticParams` (see `/distillations/[slug]`). Do not build class names dynamically (`text-${accent}`); Tailwind cannot see them, so use literal ternaries.
- Dates in JSON-LD and the sitemap come from **git author dates** via `src/lib/contentDate.ts`, not `fs.statSync().mtime`. A fresh CI checkout resets mtimes to the deploy time, so mtime would restamp every page on each deploy. Do not reintroduce mtime.

## The scorecard is the standard (lockstep)

`/scorecard` renders the seven brake-integrity criteria from the policy paper section 3. **Changing the scorecard means changing the standard**, in the paper and on the page together. There is an open revision proposal, `docs/proposals/2026-07-16-scorecard-v2-brake-performance-test.md`; the current seven-part test stays operative until that clears review, so do not quietly edit the dimensions out of band.

## Dependency pins (load-bearing; do not casually bump)

The stack runs current majors (Next 16, React 19, Tailwind 4, ESLint 9, TypeScript 6), but a few pins are deliberate and will break the build if "helpfully" upgraded:

- **ESLint stays at 9, not 10.** `eslint-config-next` 16 only needs `eslint >=9`; ESLint 10 needs a `typescript-eslint` that this registry only ships in broken form.
- **`typescript-eslint` is pinned to 8.59.4 via `overrides`**, and **`tailwindcss` + `@tailwindcss/postcss` to exact 4.3.0** (4.3.1-4.3.3 and typescript-eslint 8.60+ publish against sibling packages that were never published).
- **TypeScript stays at 6** (no stable 7 exists yet). Lint runs via `eslint .` (flat config in `eslint.config.mjs`); `next lint` was removed in Next 16.

Dependabot keeps proposing majors and its exact version numbers are sometimes phantom (they 404). Before merging one, confirm the target and its transitive deps actually resolve; land on the newest coherent release, not Dependabot's literal number. The dev CSP grants `unsafe-eval` only when `NODE_ENV=development` (React 19 dev tooling); the production CSP stays tight.

## Build, deploy, verify

```bash
npm run dev     # http://localhost:3333
npm run build   # typecheck + compile; run before committing nontrivial changes
npm run lint    # eslint . (flat config); run before opening a PR
npm run start   # serve the production build
```

- **Deploy**: Railway auto-deploys `main` (roughly 45s to 2min), fronted by Cloudflare. Verify user-facing changes live on de-amplify.com after the deploy, not just in the local build.
- **CSP**: security headers, including a scoped Content-Security-Policy, live in `next.config.mjs`. If you add an external embed or resource, update the CSP or the browser will block it at runtime. The one current external dependency is the Suno iframe (allowed via `frame-src`). Check the browser console for CSP violations after deploying.
- **Railway port gotcha**: the custom-domain target port must match the injected `$PORT` (8080). Do not hardcode `-p`. See the "Port note" in the README.

## Known open threads

- The two tier-down hearing ledgers (May 2026 Senate verdicts, Dec 2025 House legislative solutions) are built from witness written testimony because GPO has not published their official transcripts. When a transcript publishes (the lag runs a year or more), the ledger should be rebuilt to the full standard and the tier-down banners retired; the `/distillations` and `/hearings` surfaces pick the change up from the ledger.
