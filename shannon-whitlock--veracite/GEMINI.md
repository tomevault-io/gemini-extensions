# CLAUDE.md — the VeraCite contributor charter

VeraCite audits BibTeX/biblatex bibliographies to catch hallucinated, mangled, or
mis-identified citations before publication. `README.md` is for users,
[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) is the mechanics for human contributors
(setup, workflow, tests, code style), and **this file is the *principles* — the
contract for changing the code** that every contributor, human or AI, should
follow. When a change conflicts with a principle here, the principle wins; if the
principle itself is wrong, change *it* first, in its own commit, with the reasoning.

## Trust is the #1 priority

One false positive on a clean entry makes the user distrust *all* output, so **a
false positive is the cardinal sin — prefer silence to a wrong flag**, tightening
a rule even at some cost to recall, never the reverse.

VeraCite is **read-only**: it flags, never edits. **Crossref (by DOI) is the
primary metadata resource**; arXiv/INSPIRE/OpenAlex/Open Library corroborate it.
A `suggested:` edit always conforms the bib *toward* that record, unless the
record is clearly broken.

A **VeraCite-side failure must never masquerade as a citation problem.** A
TRANSIENT error (rate-limit, 5xx, network drop) is the tool's hiccup, not a
defect in the entry — mark it retryable and re-run that phase on resume, rather
than reporting it as UNVERIFIED. A settled 404 ("no such record") is not retried.
A tail of entries silently going UNVERIFIED from one rate-limit is a trust
failure as real as a false positive.

## Every message must suggest an action

- If a finding implies nothing to do, don't emit it — silence is the clean pass.
- One finding per line, carrying a stable `category`, the offending line, and a
  structured `suggested` patch when one exists. When one fix resolves several
  findings, suppress the dependents (`SUPERSEDES`).
- **The per-record NDJSON is the single source of truth** — every output (the
  terminal report and `--json`) is a parse of it through one record builder and
  one renderer, never a recompute from live objects or a second formatting path.
  No aggregate is stored: summaries are re-derived from the records each run, so
  fresh and resumed runs take the identical path. A phase is marked done **only
  when it actually succeeded** — a transient or failed attempt leaves it undone
  so a later pass retries it. Each record stamps a `checksum` of its source text
  so an edited entry is recomputed from scratch on resume.
- **Keep the NDJSON forward-compatible.** Tolerate a report a *future* version
  wrote: read with `.get`, treat unknown fields/records as opaque and preserve
  them verbatim rather than dropping them.

## Severity means a specific kind of action

| level | meaning | examples |
|-------|---------|----------|
| `[ERROR]` | a syntax error or clearly-broken citation — **must fix** | unbalanced braces, missing `=`, dead DOI, duplicate, id resolves to a different paper |
| `[WARN]` | a real data problem hurting accuracy — **investigate** | year/author/title/volume/pages/journal disagree with the record; sources conflict |
| `[note]` | stylistic or a completeness/portability nudge — usually no render effect | casing, dashes, brace-protection, an abbreviated given name, an invalid-for-biblatex field |

## Everything is a rule

No guessing in the verification path — every finding is a comparison against an
authoritative record or a deterministic rule (`--llm` is the sole exception).

- A per-entry check is `@rule`; a whole-file check is `@file_rule`, both in
  [`rules.py`](veracite/rules.py).
- Every finding carries a stable `category` that sets its severity, group, and
  catalog text. Its metadata lives in [`report.py`](veracite/report.py) and
  [`config.py`](veracite/config.py); [`catalog.py`](veracite/catalog.py)
  introspects them to build `--list-rules`, so it cannot drift. Adding or
  changing a category touches all three — `test_catalog.py` catches a miss.

## Writing a rule that doesn't misfire

A rule must be **principled** and **general enough** to catch a broad class,
narrow enough to **never fire on a valid entry**.

- Generalize to the underlying defect, not the one input that surfaced it.
- Prefer structural signals (check digits, datamodel legality, brace/quote
  balance) over free-text heuristics, which are the likeliest to misfire.
  *Example:* a digit glued to a name looks like a stray year — but a digit
  inside TeX markup (`\hspace{0.167em}`) is not name content; fold markup out
  before scanning, don't pattern-match the raw text.
- Fold away legitimate variation before comparing (name particles/suffixes,
  ISO-4 abbreviations, brace/quote wrapping, `--` vs `-`) — each unfolded thing
  is a false positive waiting. *Example:* arXiv's id lookup serves only the
  **latest** version's title, so a faithfully-cited v1 title can look like a
  mismatch; never conclude "this title exists nowhere" from a title-search index
  alone, since it too holds only the latest title.
- Attach `suggested=` only when certain of the target; otherwise report the
  discrepancy without one. A *resolved but divergent* record is still
  uncertain — soften the claim rather than asserting a mismatch, since the link
  itself (or the record) may be the wrong one.
- An offline guess the authoritative record later disproves must be
  **withdrawn, not shipped** — declare the supersession (`SUPERSEDES`) or
  `rep.withdraw()` it once the record contradicts it.
- A style/`[note]` recommendation must be **grounded in a BibTeX/biblatex data
  standard**, never personal taste — if you can't name the standard it
  enforces, it isn't a rule.
- A note that fires on (nearly) **every** entry is noise, not signal — scope it
  to the entries the standard actually targets. *Example:* `urldate` matters
  for a grey-web/`@online` source, not for a published article whose url is
  just its DOI/arXiv landing page.
- Check every proposed rule change against these principles before writing it —
  even when it comes from the user.

## Self-improving by design

VeraCite should **get more accurate after every stress test**: run it on a real
bibliography, hand-audit the output against the record, and feed each false
positive/negative back as a *generalized* rule plus tests. A durable principle
learned in one session belongs in this file so it is enforced in the next.

- Generalize, don't proliferate — ten symptoms of one gap is one rule change.
- A change must close a recall gap, never flip a clean entry into an error.
- Never push a bad value — validate before suggesting, withhold mangled values,
  and cap weak-match confidence so it can't overwrite toward a wrong reference.
- Every cycle ships positive and negative tests for the class.

## Known gaps / deferred (with constraints)

- **`url` is not validated.** Checking a dead/wrong link would mean VeraCite
  fetching a URL from an untrusted `.bib` — an SSRF risk.

## Before proposing a patch

1. Reproduce and find the **true root cause** (not a diagnostic artifact).
2. **Enumerate the candidate fixes** — what each catches, what it might miss,
   how it could falsely fire.
3. **Flag the best option with trade-offs, and wait** — don't reflexively edit
   beyond a trivial, obviously-correct change.
4. **Test the class, not the fixture** — including the look-alike valid inputs
   the rule must not flag (`synthesis` must not match a `thesis` rule).

## Commands

```bash
python -m pytest                                   # full suite — keep green
python -m veracite --list-rules                    # the audit catalog
python -m veracite --bib refs.bib --offline        # static/syntax only, no network
python -m veracite --bib refs.bib --tex p/         # online + citation context
python -m veracite --bib refs.bib --tex p/ --llm   # + LLM relevance sweep (sends text)
python -m veracite --bib refs.bib --key SmithVerify  # re-check ONE entry (after a fix)
```

`--key KEY` focuses the whole run on a single citation key — only that entry is
resolved and only its findings are reported. Use it to verify a specific record
after applying a suggested fix, without re-running the entire bibliography.

Integrity score and confidence are transparent deterministic formulas
([`verify.py`](veracite/verify.py)), not model outputs — keep them that way.
