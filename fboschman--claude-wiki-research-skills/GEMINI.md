# Wiki Operating Schema

Read at start of every session before any wiki work.

## Purpose

LLM-maintained research wiki for an academic researcher. Configure the research topics below for your domain. Default topics:
- Learning theory (decolonial, mycelial, challenge-based, boundary crossing)
- Sustainability transitions + higher education
- Systems thinking + wicked problems
- Education design research (EDR)
- AI in education and SME contexts
- Lifelong Learning

Wiki feeds papers, research projects, and a future book. Not a note-taking system — a compiled, synthesised knowledge base.

## Configuration

Set these in your local copy before using the skills:

```
WIKI_ROOT: /path/to/your/wiki/
RAW_ROOT:  /path/to/your/raw/
WIKI_LANGUAGE: en
RESEARCHER_NAME: Your Name
INSTITUTION: Your Institution
```

## Language Policy

**All wiki pages in English.** Raw sources may be in any language. Summarise non-English sources in English. Quote key terms in the original language where no clean English equivalent exists, with translation in parentheses.

## Directory Layout

```

├── podcasts/          ← podcast notes, transcripts
└── legacy/            ← archived old notes (read-only, never modify)
```

**Raw sources immutable.** Never edit `raw/`. Read from it; write only to `wiki/`.

# [Claim title]

## 1. Claim
[One sentence, identical to the title. Claim-shaped, not topic-shaped.]

## 2. Frame
[The theoretical lens. Name it explicitly.]

## 3. Substrate
[APA references that ground the claim.]

## 4. Connections
[≥2 links to existing wiki pages. State the connection explicitly.]

## 5. Generative question
[What new inquiry does this claim open?]

## 6. Counter-argument
[The strongest objection. If you cannot state it, the claim is not ready.]

## 7. Confidence
**H / M / L** — [one sentence explaining why]

## 8. Open threads
[What does this note need to mature?]
```

**FUNGI filename convention**: slugify the claim, not a topic label. `scalable-knowledge-destroys-relational-context.md`, not `tsing-notes.md`.

**Status progression**:
- `seedling` — claim stated, frame named, ≥1 source; counter-argument may be thin
- `developing` — counter-argument addressed, ≥2 connections confirmed, generative question sharpened
- `mature` — ready to promote: claim can stand in paper argument without further hedging

**Promotion rule**: mature fleeting note → incorporate into concept, tension, theme, or output page. Set `promoted: true` and `promoted_to: [[target-page]]`. Do not delete the note — it is the audit trail.

## Operations

### Ingest a new source
1. User provides source (drops file in `raw/`, pastes text, or gives URL)
2. Read source fully
3. Write `sources/` page
4. Update or create relevant `concepts/`, `thinkers/`, `themes/` pages
5. Update or create `tensions/` pages if contradictions surface
6. Update `index.md`
7. Append to `log.md`
8. Single source typically touches 5–15 wiki pages

### Create a FUNGI note
1. User provides raw idea, quote, observation, or half-formed claim
2. Distil to single claim sentence (claim-shaped, not topic-shaped)
3. Identify theoretical frame it belongs to
4. Identify ≥2 existing wiki pages it connects to
5. Write `fleeting/[claim-slug].md` using FUNGI schema
6. Set `status: seedling`
7. Append brief entry to `log.md`
8. Add to Fleeting Notes section of `index.md`
9. Do **not** update concept/theme pages yet — that happens at promotion

### Promote a FUNGI note
1. User signals note is ready (status: mature, or explicitly asked)
2. Identify target wiki page(s) the claim should be incorporated into
3. Integrate claim into those pages (concept, tension, theme, or output)
4. Set `promoted: true` and `promoted_to: [[target-page]]` in frontmatter
5. Update `index.md` — mark entry as promoted with pointer to target
6. Append to `log.md`

### Lint the wiki (use `/wiki-link-check`)
**Standard checks (every session):**
1. **A1 — Orphan Detector**: scan all pages for zero inbound wikilinks; group by folder; distinguish expected orphans (fresh fleeting) from structural gaps (unlinked tensions, sources, thinkers)
2. **A2 — Frontmatter Completeness**: check each page type against schema above; flag missing `type`, `last_updated`, YAML list errors
3. **A4 — Gap-to-Ingest Priority List**: identify sources referenced ≥5× and thinkers referenced ≥3× without their own page; rank by load-bearing status

**Rotating analytical checks (≥1 per session):**
- **B1 — Fruiting Body Detector**: flag pages where high connectivity suppresses tension; ask what it is hiding
- **B2 — Lateral Connector**: surface structural homologs across clusters lacking a wikilink or tension page
- **B3 — Asabiyyah Check**: for each framework, state what social bond sustains it and what institutional condition dissolves it
- **B4 — Dynasty Cycle Audit**: assign Ibn Khaldun generation (1/2/3) to mature frameworks; name the next decay warning sign
- **B5 — Simulacra Order Check**: assign Baudrillard order (1–4) to institutional concepts

### Build a paper outline
1. User names paper or research question
2. Read relevant `themes/`, `tensions/`, `concepts/` pages
3. Propose structure as new `outputs/[paper-name].md` page
4. Identify what is ready to write, what needs more sources, what needs resolution
5. Update `index.md`

## Index Conventions

`index.md` has sections: Concepts, Thinkers, Themes & Tensions, Sources, Outputs, Fleeting. Each entry is one line:
```
- [[page-name]] — one-line description
```

Keep it scannable. This is how Claude navigates the wiki at query time.

## Log Conventions

Each log entry:
```
## [YYYY-MM-DD] operation | title
```
Operations: `ingest`, `query`, `lint`, `outline`, `founding-pass`, `session`

## Maintenance Rules

- Never leave concept page without ≥1 `related_concepts` link
- Never leave thinker page without ≥1 `key_concepts` link
- Every `themes/` page must have `feeds_into` field naming specific paper or book chapter
- When sources contradict each other, create `tensions/` page — do not silently pick one
- When adding new page, always update `index.md` in same session
- Prefer updating existing pages over creating new ones when content overlaps
- `overview.md` updated at least every 5 ingests or when major synthesis shift occurs

## On the Research Agenda

Adapt this section to your own research programme. The researcher is working toward:
1. **Papers** on [your research topics]
2. **A book** — [scope TBD]
3. **Research projects** — [institutional context]

When building theme pages or paper outlines: keep both international academic audience and local institutional context in mind. Work should bridge theory and practice.
