## Skills Activation

This project has domain-specific skills available in `**/skills/**`. You MUST activate the relevant skill whenever you work in that domain—don't wait until you're stuck.

## Conventions

- You must follow all existing code conventions used in this application. When creating or editing a file, check sibling files for the correct structure, approach, and naming.
- Use descriptive names for variables and methods. For example, `isRegisteredForDiscounts`, not `discount()`.
- Check for existing components to reuse before writing a new one.

## Verification Scripts

- Do not create verification scripts or tinker when tests cover that functionality and prove they work. Unit and feature tests are more important.

## Application Structure & Architecture

- Stick to existing directory structure; don't create new base folders without approval.
- Do not change the application's dependencies without approval.

## Frontend Bundling

- If the user doesn't see a frontend change reflected in the UI, it could mean they need to run `npm run build`, `npm run dev`, or `composer run dev`. Ask them.

## Documentation Files

- You must only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the user.

## Replies

- Be concise in your explanations - focus on what's important rather than explaining obvious details.

=== boost rules ===

# Laravel Boost

## Tools

- Laravel Boost is an MCP server with tools designed specifically for this application. Prefer Boost tools over manual alternatives like shell commands or file reads.
- Use `database-query` to run read-only queries against the database instead of writing raw SQL in tinker.
- Use `database-schema` to inspect table structure before writing migrations or models.
- Use `get-absolute-url` to resolve the correct scheme, domain, and port for project URLs. Always use this before sharing a URL with the user.
- Use `browser-logs` to read browser logs, errors, and exceptions. Only recent logs are useful, ignore old entries.

## Searching Documentation (IMPORTANT)

- Always use `search-docs` before making code changes. Do not skip this step. It returns version-specific docs based on installed packages automatically.
- Pass a `packages` array to scope results when you know which packages are relevant.
- Use multiple broad, topic-based queries: `['rate limiting', 'routing rate limiting', 'routing']`. Expect the most relevant results first.
- Do not add package names to queries because package info is already shared. Use `test resource table`, not `filament 4 test resource table`.

### Search Syntax

1. Use words for auto-stemmed AND logic: `rate limit` matches both "rate" AND "limit".
2. Use `"quoted phrases"` for exact position matching: `"infinite scroll"` requires adjacent words in order.
3. Combine words and phrases for mixed queries: `middleware "rate limit"`.
4. Use multiple queries for OR logic: `queries=["authentication", "middleware"]`.

## Artisan

- Run Artisan commands directly via the command line (e.g., `php artisan route:list`). Use `php artisan list` to discover available commands and `php artisan [command] --help` to check parameters.
- Inspect routes with `php artisan route:list`. Filter with: `--method=GET`, `--name=users`, `--path=api`, `--except-vendor`, `--only-vendor`.
- Read configuration values using dot notation: `php artisan config:show app.name`, `php artisan config:show database.default`. Or read config files directly from the `config/` directory.

## Tinker

- Execute PHP in app context for debugging and testing code. Do not create models without user approval, prefer tests with factories instead. Prefer existing Artisan commands over custom tinker code.
- Always use single quotes to prevent shell expansion: `php artisan tinker --execute 'Your::code();'`
  - Double quotes for PHP strings inside: `php artisan tinker --execute 'User::where("active", true)->count();'`

=== php rules ===

# PHP

- Always use curly braces for control structures, even for single-line bodies.
- Use PHP 8 constructor property promotion: `public function __construct(public GitHub $github) { }`. Do not leave empty zero-parameter `__construct()` methods unless the constructor is private.
- Use explicit return type declarations and type hints for all method parameters: `function isAccessible(User $user, ?string $path = null): bool`
- Use TitleCase for Enum keys: `FavoritePerson`, `BestLake`, `Monthly`.
- Prefer PHPDoc blocks over inline comments. Only add inline comments for exceptionally complex logic.
- Use array shape type definitions in PHPDoc blocks.

=== deployments rules ===

# Deployment

- Laravel can be deployed using [Laravel Cloud](https://cloud.laravel.com/), which is the fastest way to deploy and scale production Laravel applications.

=== tests rules ===

# Test Enforcement

- Every change must be programmatically tested. Write a new test or update an existing test, then run the affected tests to make sure they pass.
- Run the minimum number of tests needed to ensure code quality and speed. Use `php artisan test --compact` with a specific filename or filter.

=== inertia-laravel/core rules ===

# Inertia

- Inertia creates fully client-side rendered SPAs without modern SPA complexity, leveraging existing server-side patterns.
- Components live in `resources/js/pages` (unless specified in `vite.config.js`). Use `Inertia::render()` for server-side routing instead of Blade views.
- ALWAYS use `search-docs` tool for version-specific Inertia documentation and updated code examples.
- IMPORTANT: Activate `inertia-vue-development` when working with Inertia Vue client-side patterns.

# Inertia v3

- Use all Inertia features from v1, v2, and v3. Check the documentation before making changes to ensure the correct approach.
- New v3 features: standalone HTTP requests (`useHttp` hook), optimistic updates with automatic rollback, layout props (`useLayoutProps` hook), instant visits, simplified SSR via `@inertiajs/vite` plugin, custom exception handling for error pages.
- Carried over from v2: deferred props, infinite scroll, merging props, polling, prefetching, once props, flash data.
- When using deferred props, add an empty state with a pulsing or animated skeleton.
- Axios has been removed. Use the built-in XHR client with interceptors, or install Axios separately if needed.
- `Inertia::lazy()` / `LazyProp` has been removed. Use `Inertia::optional()` instead.
- Prop types (`Inertia::optional()`, `Inertia::defer()`, `Inertia::merge()`) work inside nested arrays with dot-notation paths.
- SSR works automatically in Vite dev mode with `@inertiajs/vite` - no separate Node.js server needed during development.
- Event renames: `invalid` is now `httpException`, `exception` is now `networkError`.
- `router.cancel()` replaced by `router.cancelAll()`.
- The `future` configuration namespace has been removed - all v2 future options are now always enabled.

=== laravel/core rules ===

# Do Things the Laravel Way

- Use `php artisan make:` commands to create new files (i.e. migrations, controllers, models, etc.). You can list available Artisan commands using `php artisan list` and check their parameters with `php artisan [command] --help`.
- If you're creating a generic PHP class, use `php artisan make:class`.
- Pass `--no-interaction` to all Artisan commands to ensure they work without user input. You should also pass the correct `--options` to ensure correct behavior.

### Model Creation

- When creating new models, create useful factories and seeders for them too. Ask the user if they need any other things, using `php artisan make:model --help` to check the available options.

## APIs & Eloquent Resources

- For APIs, default to using Eloquent API Resources and API versioning unless existing API routes do not, then you should follow existing application convention.

## URL Generation

- When generating links to other pages, prefer named routes and the `route()` function.

## Testing

- When creating models for tests, use the factories for the models. Check if the factory has custom states that can be used before manually setting up the model.
- Faker: Use methods such as `$this->faker->word()` or `fake()->randomDigit()`. Follow existing conventions whether to use `$this->faker` or `fake()`.
- When creating tests, make use of `php artisan make:test [options] {name}` to create a feature test, and pass `--unit` to create a unit test. Most tests should be feature tests.

## Vite Error

- If you receive an "Illuminate\Foundation\ViteException: Unable to locate file in Vite manifest" error, you can run `npm run build` or ask the user to run `npm run dev` or `composer run dev`.

=== wayfinder/core rules ===

# Laravel Wayfinder

Use Wayfinder to generate TypeScript functions for Laravel routes. Import from `@/actions/` (controllers) or `@/routes/` (named routes).

=== pint/core rules ===

# Laravel Pint Code Formatter

- If you have modified any PHP files, you must run `vendor/bin/pint --dirty --format agent` before finalizing changes to ensure your code matches the project's expected style.
- Do not run `vendor/bin/pint --test --format agent`, simply run `vendor/bin/pint --format agent` to fix any formatting issues.

=== pest/core rules ===

## Pest

- This project uses Pest for testing. Create tests: `php artisan make:test --pest {name}`.
- The `{name}` argument should not include the test suite directory. Use `php artisan make:test --pest SomeFeatureTest` instead of `php artisan make:test --pest Feature/SomeFeatureTest`.
- Run tests: `php artisan test --compact` or filter: `php artisan test --compact --filter=testName`.
- Do NOT delete tests without approval.

=== inertia-vue/core rules ===

# Inertia + Vue

Vue components must have a single root element.
- IMPORTANT: Activate `inertia-vue-development` when working with Inertia Vue client-side patterns.

# Project Conventions

<!-- Custom project guidance below is preserved across `boost:update` runs. -->

## Commits & PR titles — Conventional Commits drive the release (non-negotiable)

- **Releases are automated by release-please** (`.github/workflows/release-please.yml`, config in `release-please-config.json`). On every push to `master` it parses **Conventional Commit** prefixes to compute the next version and generate `CHANGELOG.md`. Never hand-edit `CHANGELOG.md`, `VERSION`, or `.release-please-manifest.json` — release-please owns them.
- **The repo merges PRs by squash only, and the squash commit subject is the PR title** (`squash_merge_commit_title = PR_TITLE`). So **the PR title _is_ the commit release-please reads** — it MUST be a valid Conventional Commit (`type: imperative subject`, lower-case type, no trailing period), e.g. `feat: edit last message from the composer with ↑`. A PR titled like a sentence ("Edit last message…") is **silently dropped from the changelog and the version bump** — this is the #1 mistake here.
- **Changelog-relevant types** (from `release-please-config.json`): `feat` → Features (minor bump), `fix` → Bug Fixes (patch), `perf` → Performance, `refactor` → Code Refactoring, `deps` → Dependencies. A breaking change (`feat!:` / `fix!:`, or a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer) forces a major bump. `deps` is the type for dependency bumps (the `update-deps` skill and dependabot both emit it): it appears under **Dependencies** but is **non-bumping**, so a deps-only batch never cuts a release on its own — it rides along into the next `feat`/`fix` release. Other Conventional types are allowed (`docs`, `test`, `chore`, `ci`, `build`, `style`) but **do not appear in the changelog and do not bump the version** — only use them for PRs that genuinely ship no user-facing feature/fix.
- **Keep individual commit messages Conventional too.** `commitlint` (config-conventional) runs on every PR and validates the PR's commits — but note it does **not** validate the PR title, so a PR can pass CI yet still land a non-Conventional squash subject. The PR title is the one that reaches release-please, so it is the one that must be right.
- **Branch names are cosmetic** (release-please ignores them). Mirror the type if you like (`feat/…`, `fix/…`), but never rely on the branch name for the changelog — set the PR title.
- **When opening a PR with `gh pr create`, always pass a Conventional-Commit `--title`** and reference the issue in the body (`Closes #NNN`).

## Implementing Issues (TDD)

- **Always activate the `tdd` skill when implementing an issue or building a feature.** Drive the work test-first (red → green → refactor): write a failing test that captures the acceptance criterion, make it pass with the minimal change, then refactor. This pairs with the non-negotiable 100% coverage gate below.

## Internationalization (i18n) — never hardcode user-facing copy

- **All user-visible copy must go through the translation layer — never hardcode English in a component, controller, or Blade view.** The message key *is* the English source string (matching Laravel's JSON translation convention), so a missing translation falls back to readable English.
- **Frontend (Vue):**
  - In templates, use the global `$t` helper (registered in `resources/js/app.ts`, available in every component with no import): `{{ $t('Save changes') }}`, `:placeholder="$t('Search messages')"`, `:aria-label="$t('Close')"`, `<Head :title="$t('Notifications')" />`.
  - In `<script setup>`, use `const { t } = useTranslations()` (from `@/composables/useTranslations`). For module-scope contexts like `defineOptions({ layout: { breadcrumbs: [...] } })`, import `translate` from `@/lib/i18n`.
  - Interpolate dynamic values with Laravel-style `:placeholder` tokens: `$t('Signed in as :name', { name: user.name })`.
  - Format dates, times, and numbers through the locale-aware helpers in `@/lib/datetime` and `@/lib/numbers` (they default to the active locale) — never call `toLocaleString`/`Intl` with a hardcoded locale.
  - Keep `data-test` selectors, route names, CSS classes, and other non-visible strings **out** of `$t` — translate only what a user reads.
- **Backend (PHP/Blade):** wrap user-facing strings in `__('...')` (flash messages, mailables, notifications, any string rendered to the user). Add new keys to the catalogs below.
- **Catalogs:** English needs no file (keys are English). Add every new key's translation to `lang/fr.json` (and any future locale). The per-user locale lives on `users.locale` (the `App\Enums\AppLocale` enum); `App\Http\Middleware\SetLocale` applies it and inlines the active catalog, and `LocaleCatalogController` serves catalogs for in-app language switching.
- When adding a new locale, add its enum case in `App\Enums\AppLocale`, its `lang/{locale}.json`, and nothing else — the plumbing picks it up automatically.

## Frontend Tooling (run through Sail)

- **Always run Node/npm tooling through Sail** — `./vendor/bin/sail npm run <script>`, never bare `npm` on the host. `node_modules` is installed inside the Linux container, so its native bindings (`@unrs/resolver-*`, `@rolldown/binding-*`) are Linux-only. Running `npm run build`, `lint`, etc. directly on macOS fails with `Cannot find native binding` (the npm optional-dependencies bug); Sail runs them in the matching Linux environment where the bindings exist.
- `vue-tsc` (`npm run types:check`) doesn't use those native bindings, so it can run on the host, but prefer Sail for consistency.
- The frontend quality gate is `./vendor/bin/sail npm run lint:check`, `format:check`, `types:check`, and `build` — all four must pass before pushing. Use `sail npm run lint` / `format` (the write variants) to auto-fix violations.

## Generated TypeScript Types

- **Prefer the generated `App.Data.*` / `App.Enums.*` ambient types over hand-duplicating a DTO or enum in `@/types`.** They are produced from the PHP `Data` classes and enums by `spatie/laravel-typescript-transformer` (configured in `app/Providers/TypeScriptTransformerServiceProvider.php`), so the frontend stays in lockstep with the backend shape. Example: `type CustomEmoji = App.Data.CustomEmojiData`.
- **`resources/js/generated/generated.d.ts` is a git-ignored build artifact**, not source. Regenerate it with `./vendor/bin/sail artisan typescript:transform` after adding or changing any `Data` class or enum — otherwise `vue-tsc` fails with `TS2503: Cannot find namespace 'App'`.
- **CI regenerates it before type-checking** (the `Generate TypeScript Types` step in `.github/workflows/tests.yml`), so a fresh checkout with no `generated.d.ts` still passes — never assume the file pre-exists.

## Automated Refactoring (Rector)

- **Rector is the automated-fix layer for structural PHP**, complementing Pint (style) and PHPStan (detection). It enforces our conventions (explicit return types, type hints, readonly, early returns, dead-code removal, PHP/Laravel modernization) by rewriting the code, and its config lives in `rector.php` (scoped to the same paths PHPStan analyzes, plus `tests/`).
- **`composer refactor` applies fixes; `composer refactor:check` is the dry-run.** Think of `composer refactor` as the semantic counterpart to Pint's `composer lint` formatter — run it to auto-apply structural fixes before pushing.
- **The backend gate runs Rector.** `./vendor/bin/sail composer test` now also runs `rector process --dry-run` (via `refactor:check`), and CI runs it too. A failing dry-run fails the build — run `./vendor/bin/sail composer refactor` to apply the suggested changes, review the diff, and re-run the gate before pushing.

## Code Coverage

- **100% code coverage is required — this is non-negotiable.** The test suite is gated at `--min=100` (see the `test` script in `composer.json`), so any line left uncovered fails the build.
- **Always check coverage before pushing.** Run the full gate — which also runs Pint, PHPStan, and Rector — with `./vendor/bin/sail composer test` (this executes `lint:check`, `types:check`, `refactor:check`, and `php artisan test --coverage --min=100`). Do not push or open/update a PR until it reports `Total: 100.0 %` with a clean Rector dry-run.
- If new code drops coverage, add or update tests until it is back at 100%. When a line reads as uncovered even though a test exercises it (e.g. the `: null` branch of a multi-line ternary is a known PCOV line-attribution quirk), collapse it onto a single line rather than leaving the gate red.

## Reporting Bugs Found While Doing Something Else

- **When you discover a bug, broken tooling, or other pre-existing defect while implementing an unrelated feature, do not fix it inline.** Keep the current change focused on its own scope.
- **Before filing anything, check for an existing issue** covering the same defect: run `gh issue list --state open --search "<keywords>"` (and search closed issues too). If one already exists, reference it in your PR instead of opening a duplicate.
- If none exists, open a GitHub issue with `gh issue create` describing the problem: what's broken, how it surfaced (reference the PR/feature you were working on), why it matters, and clear acceptance criteria for the fix. Apply a fitting label (e.g. `tech-debt`).
- Mention the new issue in the PR of the feature you're working on so the discovery is traceable, then continue with the original task.
- Only fix the defect inline if it directly blocks the feature you're implementing; otherwise defer it to the issue.

## Self-Hosting Documentation (Starlight) — keep it in sync

- **The public docs site lives in `docs/`** (an Astro Starlight project, deployed to Cloudflare Pages). It is self-contained — its own `package.json`/`node_modules`, isolated from the Laravel/Vite app and **excluded from every app quality gate** (ESLint, Pint, Prettier, PHPStan, Rector, `vue-tsc`). Content is Markdown/MDX under `docs/src/content/docs/`; site config (title, sidebar, edit links) is in `docs/astro.config.mjs`. Not to be confused with `dev-docs/` (internal ADRs, PRD, design notes — not published).
- **When a change adds or alters anything operator-facing, update the docs in the same PR.** This is a non-negotiable part of "done" for such changes, the same way i18n catalogs and tests are. Triggers include:
  - A new or changed **`.env`/config setting** an operator would set — especially a feature toggle (like `REGISTRATION_ENABLED`, `EMAIL_VERIFICATION_ENABLED`). Update `docs/src/content/docs/reference/environment-variables.md` and, if it's an on/off switch, `docs/src/content/docs/reference/feature-toggles.md`.
  - A change to **install, configuration, reverse-proxy/TLS, first-run, or upgrade** steps, or to the **production stack** (services in `docker-compose.prod.yml`, volumes, drivers). Update the relevant page under `docs/src/content/docs/self-hosting/` and `docs/src/content/docs/reference/architecture.md`.
- **Source the docs from the code, not memory.** Read the actual `config/*.php`, `.env.example`, and `docker-compose.prod.yml` so defaults and behaviour are accurate; if the root `README.md` disagrees with the compose file, the compose file wins (and file a `documentation` issue for the stale README).
- **Verify the site still builds:** `cd docs && npm run build` (Node tooling for the docs site runs on the host, not through Sail — its `node_modules` is a separate host install). See `docs/README.md` for dev/build commands. Add a matching key to any relevant page's sidebar entry in `astro.config.mjs` when you add a new page.
