# GitHub Copilot Instructions for Problem-Based SRS

## Project Overview
This repository provides AgentSkills for following a Problem-Based Software Requirements Specification (SRS) methodology. The focus is on enabling AI-assisted requirements engineering through structured, problem-first approaches.

The repository follows the **[AgentSkills](https://agentskills.io)** standard and the **Claude Code Plugins** layout. Compatibility priority is **GitHub Copilot first**, then **Claude Code/Claude.ai**.

### Plugin Standards

**This repository follows the Claude Code plugins specification:**
- **Plugins Guide**: https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins.md
- **Plugins Reference**: https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins-reference.md

When modifying this repository structure, ensure compliance with these plugin standards.

### Compatibility Priority (GHCP → Claude)

1. **GitHub Copilot first**: Keep skills and instructions directly usable in Copilot workflows.
2. **Claude second**: Keep `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `skills/`, `agents/`, `hooks/`, and `settings.json` aligned with Claude plugin docs.
3. **Consistency over time**: Keep compatibility guidance consistent when it changes.

## Core Principles
1. **Problem-First Thinking**: Always identify the problem before proposing solutions
2. **Lightweight Methodology**: Favor simplicity over complex frameworks
3. **AI-Native Design**: Content designed for consumption by AI agents (following AgentSkills standard)
4. **Practical Guidance**: Focus on actionable skills and templates

## 🔄 Problem-Based SRS Iteration Guidelines

### Using the Methodology

When analyzing or working with this repository, **use the Problem-Based SRS methodology** to iterate on problems, needs, and requirements (both functional and non-functional).

**Load and follow the methodology from these skills:**

| Step | Skill |
|------|-------|
| 0. Business Context (CONTEXT) | `skills/business-context/SKILL.md` |
| 1. Customer Problems (WHY) | `skills/customer-problems/SKILL.md` |
| 2. Software Glance | `skills/software-glance/SKILL.md` |
| 3. Customer Needs (WHAT) | `skills/customer-needs/SKILL.md` |
| 4. Software Vision | `skills/software-vision/SKILL.md` |
| 5. Functional Requirements (HOW) | `skills/functional-requirements/SKILL.md` |
| Validation | `skills/zigzag-validator/SKILL.md` |
| Complexity (Optional) | `skills/complexity-analysis/SKILL.md` |
| Orchestrator | `skills/problem-based-srs/SKILL.md` |
| Agent | `agents/problem-based-srs/AGENT.md` |

### Artifact Naming Convention

- **Customer Problems**: `CP.{n}` or `CP.{n}.{m}` (e.g., CP.01, CP.01.1)
- **Customer Needs**: `CN.{cp}.{n}` (e.g., CN.01.1 traces to CP.01)
- **Functional Requirements**: `FR.{cp}.{cn}.{n}` (e.g., FR.01.1.1 traces to CN.01.1)
- **Non-Functional Requirements**: `NFR.{version}.md` (e.g., NFR.1.0.md)

---

## 🚀 Trunk-Based Development Workflow

This repository follows **trunk-based development**. All changes go directly to `main`.

### Git Workflow for Iterations

When creating or updating requirement artifacts:

```bash
git add .                                    # Stage all changes
git commit -m "<type>: <description>"        # Commit with message
git push origin main                         # Push to trunk
```

### Commit Message Convention

| Prefix | Use Case | Example |
|--------|----------|---------|
| `feat:` | New feature or requirement | `feat: Add CP.02 for mobile access` |
| `fix:` | Bug fix or correction | `fix: Correct FR.01.2.1 traceability` |
| `docs:` | Documentation updates | `docs: Update README with new workflow` |
| `refactor:` | Restructuring without changing behavior | `refactor: Reorganize skills` |

**Always confirm with the user before pushing to main.**

---

## Workflow Guidelines

### Before Taking Action
**CRITICAL: Always plan and get confirmation before executing tasks.**

1. **Understand the Request**: Clarify what the user wants to accomplish
2. **Create a Plan**: Present a clear plan of what will be changed/created/deleted
3. **Ask for Confirmation**: Wait for user approval before executing
4. **Execute**: Only after confirmation, proceed with the changes
5. **Verify**: Show what was done and confirm completion

**Example iteration workflow:**
```
User: "Analyze the codebase and identify testing requirements"

AI: "I'll analyze using Problem-Based SRS methodology.
     Loading: skills/problem-based-srs/SKILL.md
     
     [Applies 5-step process from source files]
     
     Plan:
     1. Save analysis to spec/NFR.2.0.md
     2. git add, commit, push to main
     
     Proceed? (yes/no)"
```

├── settings.json                # Default plugin settings
└── docs/                        # Documentation
```

### Skills Development (AgentSkills Format)
- Skills are located in the `skills/` directory
- Each skill has a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter (name, description, license)
- Description field is critical - it determines when the skill triggers
- Keep SKILL.md content under 500 lines (use references/ for detailed docs)
- Follow the AgentSkills specification: https://agentskills.io/specification
- Test skills by using them in practice
- Focus on guiding users through problem identification before solution design
- Include examples that demonstrate real-world scenarios

### Documentation
- Keep documentation concise and scannable
- Use markdown formatting effectively (headers, lists, code blocks)
- Provide context for why, not just what or how
- Include references to relevant SRS standards (IEEE 830, etc.) where appropriate

### File Organization
- **`AGENTS.md`**: **Customer-facing file** — part of the project methodology for end users. Must NOT contain internal development procedures (e.g., release process, CI/CD instructions, internal workflows). Keep aligned with `agents/problem-based-srs/AGENT.md`.
- **`.github/copilot-instructions.md`**: Internal development instructions for AI agents working on this repository. All internal procedures (release process, development workflows, etc.) belong here.
- **`.claude-plugin/`**: Plugin manifest (plugin.json) defining plugin metadata
- **`skills/`**: AgentSkills (Claude Code, Claude.ai, GitHub Copilot)
  - Each skill is a self-contained directory with SKILL.md
  - Can include optional subdirectories: scripts/, references/, assets/
- **`hooks/`**: Hook configurations for event handlers (hooks.json)
- **`settings.json`**: Default plugin settings
- **`docs/`**: Documentation, research papers, methodology guides
- **`docs/references/`**: Reference documentation for AgentSkills development

### Code Style
- This is primarily a documentation repository
- Any code examples should be language-agnostic where possible
- Use clear, readable formatting in examples

## 🛠️ AgentSkills Development Guidelines

When creating or modifying skills in the `skills/` directory, **always follow the AgentSkills specification and best practices**.

### Required References

**Before modifying any skill, load and follow these reference documents:**

| Reference | Path | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| **Specification** | `docs/references/agentskills-specification.md` | SKILL.md format, required fields, directory structure |
| **Best Practices** | `docs/references/agentskills-best-practices.md` | Content organization, naming, descriptions, patterns |

### Key Requirements for Skills

#### SKILL.md Frontmatter (Required)
```yaml
---
name: skill-name           # Max 64 chars, lowercase + hyphens only
description: What and when # Max 1024 chars, written in THIRD PERSON
license: MIT               # Optional but recommended
metadata:                  # Optional additional fields
  author: author-name
  version: "1.0"
---
```

#### Critical Rules

1. **Name must match directory name** - `skills/my-skill/SKILL.md` requires `name: my-skill`
2. **Description in third person** - "Processes files" NOT "I process files" or "You can use this"
3. **Description includes WHAT and WHEN** - Help agents discover when to use the skill
4. **Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines** - Move detailed content to `references/` directory
5. **File references one level deep** - Don't nest reference → reference → reference

#### Directory Structure
```
skills/skill-name/
├── SKILL.md              # Required: instructions + metadata
├── references/           # Optional: detailed documentation
│   ├── guide.md
│   └── examples.md
├── scripts/              # Optional: executable code
└── assets/               # Optional: templates, resources
```

### Skill Modification Checklist

When modifying a skill, verify:

- [ ] `name` field is lowercase, max 64 chars, no consecutive hyphens
- [ ] `name` field matches the parent directory name
- [ ] `description` is 1-1024 chars and written in third person
- [ ] `description` explains both WHAT the skill does and WHEN to use it
- [ ] SKILL.md body is under 500 lines
- [ ] Reference files are one level deep (not nested)
- [ ] Longer reference files (100+ lines) have table of contents
- [ ] No time-sensitive information in content
- [ ] Consistent terminology throughout

### Example: Good vs Bad Descriptions

**Good (specific, third person, includes when):**
```yaml
description: Orchestrates requirements engineering using the Problem-Based SRS methodology. Use when performing requirements analysis, creating customer problems, needs, or functional requirements with full traceability.
```

**Bad (vague, first person):**
```yaml
description: I help with requirements.
```

## 📦 Release Process

This repository uses **GitHub Actions** for creating releases. The process is automated but requires manual triggering with specific inputs.

### Step-by-Step Release Process

#### 1. Update Version and CHANGELOG

**Before creating a release**, update these files:

**a. Update `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`:**
```json
{
  "name": "problem-based-srs",
  "version": "X.Y.0",  // Update this version
  ...
}
```

**b. Update `CHANGELOG.md`:**

Add a new section at the top following the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) format:

```markdown
## [X.Y] - YYYY-MM-DD

### Added
- New features or capabilities
- New skills or commands

### Changed
- Updates to existing features
- Renamed items

### Fixed
- Bug fixes

### Removed
- Deprecated features

[X.Y]: https://github.com/RafaelGorski/Problem-Based-SRS/releases/tag/vX.Y
```

**c. Commit and push changes:**
```bash
git add .claude-plugin/plugin.json CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "chore: Bump version to X.Y"
git push origin main
```

#### 2. Prepare Release Notes

Copy the release notes from `CHANGELOG.md` for the version you're releasing. The release notes should:

- Start with `## 🎉 Version X.Y - Release Name`
- Include all sections from CHANGELOG (Added, Changed, Fixed, Removed)
- Use markdown formatting
- Include the full changelog link at the end

**Example format:**
```markdown
## 🎉 Version 1.3 - Enhanced Traceability

This release introduces enhanced traceability features...

### ✨ Added

- Feature 1
- Feature 2

### 🔄 Changed

- Change 1
- Change 2

### 📚 Full Changelog

See [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/RafaelGorski/Problem-Based-SRS/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) for complete details.
```

#### 3. Trigger GitHub Actions Workflow

**Navigate to GitHub Actions:**
1. Go to the repository on GitHub
2. Click on **Actions** tab
3. Select **"Create Release"** workflow from the left sidebar
4. Click **"Run workflow"** button (top right)

**Fill in the workflow inputs:**

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **version** | Release version number (X.Y format, without 'v' prefix) | `1.3` |
| **release_name** | Short descriptive name for the release | `Enhanced Traceability` |
| **release_body** | Full release notes from CHANGELOG.md (markdown format) | Copy from CHANGELOG.md |

**Important notes:**
- The version should match the version in `plugin.json` (without the trailing `.0`)
- The workflow will automatically add the `v` prefix to create tag `vX.Y`
- The release_body supports full markdown formatting
- Escape any special characters if needed

#### 4. Verify the Release

After the workflow completes:

1. Go to **Releases** section in GitHub
2. Verify the new release appears with correct:
   - Tag name (e.g., `v1.3`)
   - Release title (e.g., `🎉 Version 1.3 - Enhanced Traceability`)
   - Release notes content
3. Check that the release is not marked as draft or pre-release

### Workflow File Location

The release workflow is defined in:
```
.github/workflows/create-release.yml
```

### Version Numbering

This project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

- **Major version (X.0.0)**: Breaking changes or major methodology updates
- **Minor version (X.Y.0)**: New features, new skills, backward-compatible changes
- **Patch version (X.Y.Z)**: Bug fixes only (rarely used, we typically increment minor)

**Current practice**: Use `X.Y` format (e.g., 1.2, 1.3) for releases, storing as `X.Y.0` in plugin.json.

### Troubleshooting

**Workflow fails with permissions error:**
- Ensure the `contents: write` permission is set in the workflow file
- Check repository settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions

**Release notes formatting is broken:**
- Check for unescaped backticks or special characters
- Ensure newlines are preserved in the release_body input
- Test markdown rendering in a GitHub comment first

**Tag already exists:**
- Delete the existing tag if it was created in error: `git push --delete origin vX.Y`
- Delete the release from GitHub UI if needed
- Re-run the workflow

### Example: Creating Release v1.3

```bash
# 1. Update version files
# Edit .claude-plugin/plugin.json: "version": "1.3.0"
# Edit CHANGELOG.md: Add ## [1.3] - 2026-03-15 section

# 2. Commit and push
git add .claude-plugin/plugin.json CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "chore: Bump version to 1.3"
git push origin main

# 3. Go to GitHub Actions → Create Release → Run workflow
# Fill in:
#   version: 1.3
#   release_name: Enhanced Traceability
#   release_body: [Copy from CHANGELOG.md section 1.3]

# 4. Verify release appears at:
# https://github.com/RafaelGorski/Problem-Based-SRS/releases/tag/v1.3
