## Skill Loading

Before substantial work:

- Skill check: run `pnpm dlx @tanstack/intent@latest list`, or use skills already listed in context.
- Skill guidance: if one local skill clearly matches the task, run `pnpm dlx @tanstack/intent@latest load <package>#<skill>` and follow the returned `SKILL.md`.
- Monorepos: when working across packages, run the skill check from the workspace root and prefer the local skill for the package being changed.
- Multiple matches: prefer the most specific local skill for the package or concern you are changing; load additional skills only when the task spans multiple packages or concerns.

# Agent Guide (Finance Tracker)

TanStack Start (React 19) full-stack finance app with SSR, Nitro v3,
PostgreSQL/Drizzle, Better Auth, Tailwind CSS v4/shadcn.

## Essentials

- **Package manager**: pnpm (not npm).
- **Path aliases**: `@/*` -> `src/*`, `~e2e/*` -> `e2e/*`, `~test/*` -> `test/*`.
- **Validation**: ArkType everywhere (not Zod). Server schema in
  `validators.ts` is the single source of truth — forms import and
  reuse it (or derive via `.pick()` / `.omit()` / `.merge()`).
  - `validators.ts` defines API contracts as independent `type({...})`
    — not derived from Drizzle insert/update schemas.
  - `models.ts` holds ArkType CRUD schemas (select/insert/update/delete)
    and entity type aliases generated via `drizzle-arktype`.
  - Cross-field validation: export `baseSchema` (pickable) +
    `schema` (narrowed). Forms `.pick()` from base schemas.
  - `drizzle-arktype` is used for select/delete schemas only.
  - Import entity types from `@/modules/{mod}/models`, not `db/schema`.
  - Import validators from `@/modules/{mod}/validators`.
- **UI style**: shadcn/ui `base-nova` (Base UI, not Radix). Use
  `render` prop / `mergeProps`, not `asChild`. Icons: Lucide
  via `@/components/icons` (never import `lucide-react` directly).
- **Typography**: Tailwind classes directly on semantic elements. See
  [styling.md](docs/development/styling.md).
- **Restricted imports** (`no-restricted-imports`):
  - `date-fns` / `@date-fns/tz` — use `@/lib/i18n/date`
  - `lucide-react` — use `@/components/icons`
  - `@base-ui/react` — only in `src/components/ui/` and
    `src/components/filters/`
  - `react-day-picker` — only in `src/components/ui/calendar.tsx`
  - `posthog-js/react` — use `@/hooks/use-analytics`

## Design Workflow

The broader pipeline flows: ideas → ADRs → specs → implementation
(tracked by Trekker). Reviews can happen at any stage.

- `docs/ideas/` — rough concepts before committing to scope
- `docs/adr/` — decisions with context, alternatives, consequences
- `docs/specs/` — scoped feature designs (per-epic or per-feature)
- `docs/research/` — prior art, community findings, library behavior

During planning-phase research, save findings to `docs/research/`
so they persist across conversations. Specs are the shared reference
that keeps tasks in an epic aligned.

## Implementation Workflow

**Never commit proactively.** Complete the full loop, present a
summary, and wait for the user's explicit "commit."

For interactive bug fixes and exploratory work, steps apply as
applicable — skip planning, TDD, and polish when the user is
driving iteration. Checks (step 7) and the commit gate (step 12)
are always required.

1. **Review** — `trekker ready`, check task context, deps, blockers.
   Set task to `in_progress`.
2. **Research** — read relevant files, `docs/` (specs, ADRs,
   research), schemas. `/component-patterns` before any UI work.
3. **Plan** — for non-trivial work, align with user. Sacrifice
   grammar for concision. List unresolved questions at the end.
   - `/tracer-bullets` — decompose epics into vertical slices
     (DB → API → UI → test). Output becomes Trekker tasks.
   - `/grill-me` — stress-test a plan or design.
   - `/improve-codebase-architecture` — identify refactoring
     opportunities when touching existing modules.
4. **TDD** — `/tdd` for server functions and business logic.
   Skip for doc-only or config changes.
5. **Implement** — until tests pass.
6. **Update tracking** — Trekker summary comment + status. Update
   docs if needed. Verify bulk edits didn't break formatting.
   Delete plan files from `.claude/plans/`.
7. **Checks** — run in order. Use fix variants to auto-correct
   and fail only on unfixable issues:
   1. If DB schema changed: `pnpm db:generate && pnpm db:migrate`
   2. `pnpm format` (auto-fixes)
   3. `pnpm lint:fix`
   4. `pnpm paraglide:compile && pnpm typecheck`
   5. `pnpm test` (unit + integration)
   6. `pnpm test:e2e`
   7. `pnpm lint:md:fix`
8. **Polish** — `/de-slopify` + `/performance-optimizer` +
   `/ui-ux-polish` if UI changed.
9. **Review** — `/pr-review-toolkit:review-pr`, fix findings.
10. **Re-run checks** if anything changed after polish/review.
11. **Check commit grouping** — one logical change per commit.
    Split when the diff contains independent concerns:
    - Bug fix separate from the refactor it revealed.
    - Schema/migration separate from the code that uses it.
    - Doc/config changes separate from feature code.
    - Test-only changes can stay with their implementation.
    - Lint/format fixups fold into the commit they belong to.
      When in doubt, ask: "could this be reverted independently?"
      If yes, it's a separate commit.
12. **Present summary** — wait for user's "commit."

## Task Tracking (Trekker)

Local task tracking via Trekker (`.trekker/` is gitignored). Use
`--toon` flag on all commands. Run `trekker ready` before starting
work. Set tasks to `in_progress` then `completed`. Add summary
comment before completing. Search before creating:
`trekker search "keyword"`.

Trekker is the source of truth for tasks/epics across sessions.
Within a session, `TaskCreate` is fine as a step-by-step mirror —
Trekker wins on conflicts.

## Code Standards

@docs/development/code-standards.md

## Feature Completion

@docs/development/definition-of-done.md

## Documentation

@docs/development/architecture.md

See [docs/README.md](docs/README.md) for the full index.

## Surgical Changes

Keep changes scoped to the task. Unrelated issues go in the summary,
not the diff.

- Remove imports/variables your changes made unused.
- Don't delete pre-existing dead code unless asked.
- Don't reformat adjacent code you didn't touch; `pnpm format` / lefthook handle that.

## Comment Policy

Comments are useful when they add value. Keep them clean and minimal.

A good comment:

- Is accurate (matches the code; remove if stale)
- Earns its place (explains WHY or non-obvious context, not WHAT)
- Is concise (one or two lines unless documenting a complex invariant)

Avoid:

- Restating what the code does
- Section markers like `// ===== HELPERS =====`
- Hedge words, apologies, "obviously", "basically", "just"
- "Note:" / "Important:" prefixes when surrounding text already conveys importance
- TODOs without ticket references
- Cross-references that belong in the PR description ("added for X", "used by Y")
- Multi-line comments on trivial code
- AI-flavored phrasings ("Here we...", "Let's...", "This...")

When in doubt: keep the comment, but make it tighter.

## Fix-vs-Defer Policy

When addressing review findings (from the review-cycle skill, PR comments, or any other reviewer):

Default to fixing inline. Defer to a follow-up only if:

- The fix is substantially more work than writing the follow-up itself
- The fix requires architectural changes spanning files outside this PR scope
- The fix requires a new dependency or schema migration not in this PR
- The fix would invalidate unrelated tests

If you can describe the fix in one sentence, just do the fix.

When deferring, briefly state which criterion above applies.
