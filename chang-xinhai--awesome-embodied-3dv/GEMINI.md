## Mission

This repository is a curated **Awesome-Embodied-3DV** list for the research space where 3D/4D perception, reconstruction, generation, simulation-ready assets, and embodied world models meet.

The goal is not to be a generic 3D generation, NeRF, 3DGS, graphics, SLAM, or robot-learning bibliography. The goal is to organize the most relevant resources for:
- 2D/physical sensing signals that feed 3D systems: depth, normals, structured light, panoramic/fisheye perception, and dense mapping
- 3D/4D representations: 3DGS, 4DGS, NeRF/SDF, mesh, voxel, point-cloud, hybrid, and dynamic representations
- offline, streaming, online, semantic, instance-level, object-centric, scene-level, and dynamic 3D reconstruction
- object-level, part-level, articulated, scene-level, editable, and simulation-ready 3D generation
- embodied world models, dynamic scene graphs, 3D grounding, robotics integration, and sim-to-real asset pipelines
- datasets, benchmarks, metrics, simulators, and toolchains that help researchers choose what to use

## Curated-list and archive policy

All manually curated content lives in `README.md`.

`arXiv_daily/` is the sole exception: it is an automatically generated, high-recall candidate archive. It must never be presented as equivalent to the verified curated root README.

Do **not** create other `contents/` pages for paper organization.
Do **not** split the awesome list into multiple manually maintained markdown content files unless the user explicitly requests it.

Allowed root-level files:
- `README.md` - the canonical awesome list
- `AGENTS.md` - governance and maintenance rules
- `LICENSE`
- `.gitignore`
- optional static assets under `assets/` or `imgs/` when they improve presentation
- `arXiv_daily/` - generated candidate archive, configuration, scripts, tests, and data

## Canonical section layout

`README.md` should use this top-level structure:
1. `Data Perception`
2. `3D/4D Representation`
3. `3D Reconstruction`
4. `3D Generation`
5. `Embodiment & World Models`
6. `Datasets, Benchmarks & Infrastructure`

Use `About`, `Must Read`, `News`, and `Contents` near the top of the README. Keep subsection anchors stable.

## Section definitions

### Data Perception

Include the sensor-facing and feature-extraction layer:
- monocular, video, and multi-view depth estimation
- normal and geometry prior estimation
- active imaging, structured light, neural decoding, event/active stereo, and physical sensing
- panoramic, fisheye, egocentric, and wide-FOV perception when relevant to 3D reconstruction or mapping
- dense mapping systems that primarily provide features/signals for downstream 3D systems

Do **not** turn this into a generic 2D perception list.

### 3D/4D Representation

Include the underlying representation structures:
- structure-aware 3D Gaussian Splatting and geometry-oriented Gaussian variants
- voxel, mesh, point-cloud, triplane, tensor, and hybrid representations
- NeRF, SDF, neural implicit surfaces, and related neural rendering foundations
- 4DGS, deformation fields, canonical spaces, deformation graphs, and spatiotemporal representations

Usually exclude purely compression-oriented or renderer-engineering-only 3DGS papers unless they materially affect embodied reconstruction, dynamics, editability, or simulation use.

### 3D Reconstruction

Include systems that recover existing objects or scenes:
- feed-forward multi-view and pose-free reconstruction
- object-centric and scene-level reconstruction
- large-scale scene reconstruction and SLAM-like systems
- streaming and online reconstruction, including persistent state models
- dense semantic / instance mapping such as SAM3D, MV-SAM3D, and open-vocabulary 3D mapping
- dynamic, non-rigid, and 4D reconstruction such as PAGE-4D and dynamic VGGT variants

Do **not** include every classical SfM/MVS paper unless it is still a key baseline, dataset anchor, or conceptual reference.

### 3D Generation

Include methods that create new 3D assets or scenes:
- image/text-to-3D object generation with mesh, texture, materials, or simulation-ready outputs
- PBR material and texture generation when relevant to asset quality
- part-level decomposition, part-aware generation, assembly, and editing
- articulated object generation, kinematic structure prediction, URDF export, and interactive assets
- scene-level generation, procedural worlds, layouts, and targeted 3D scene editing

Do **not** broaden into all 3D editing, all diffusion-based 3D papers, or all stylized asset generation. Include selectively when there is a clear embodied-3DV use case.

### Embodiment & World Models

Include work that connects 3D assets and reconstructed scenes to interaction:
- dynamic scene graphs and object/part tracking
- topologically aware dynamic reconstruction and persistent 4D scene state
- reconstruction-based or 3D-consistent world models such as NeoVerse, Gen3C, Tessart/Tessera-style work
- action-conditioned dynamics synthesis
- robotics integration, sim-to-real through generated assets, and VLM/LLM agents grounded in 3D scenes

Do **not** include generic video-generation world models unless their 3D consistency, reconstruction layer, or embodied interaction relevance is explicit.

### Datasets, Benchmarks & Infrastructure

Include the resources researchers need to choose data and evaluate systems:
- surveys and taxonomies
- reconstruction datasets: sparse-view, MVS, dense-view, RGB-D, streaming, dynamic, and semantic sequences
- generation datasets: object-level, text-to-3D, human/articulated objects, procedural/synthetic scenes
- benchmarks and metrics for reconstruction, generation, view synthesis, simulation readiness, and embodied interaction
- simulators and toolchains such as Isaac Sim, Isaac Lab, SAPIEN, MuJoCo, Habitat, Blender, USD, URDF, and related asset pipelines

## Inclusion policy

The repository uses **core + strong adjacent** scope.

### Include first

- papers and projects directly named in the README's Must Read section
- systems around feed-forward 3D reconstruction, streaming 3D, SAM3D/MV-SAM3D, PAGE-4D/dynamic VGGT, 3DGS/4DGS, ArtGS, NeoVerse, Gen3C, Tessart/Tessera, Infinigen, Lingbo-Depth, Lingbo-Map, and structured-light neural decoding
- datasets and benchmarks that help answer practical questions such as "which dataset should I use for dense-view reconstruction, streaming online 3D, object-level generation, articulated generation, or simulation-ready assets?"
- official project pages, official code repositories, official dataset pages, and canonical papers

### Include selectively

- 3D generation papers when they support object-level, part-level, articulated, scene-level, editable, or simulation-ready assets
- 3DGS papers when they affect structure, geometry, dynamics, reconstruction, editing, simulation, or embodied perception
- world-model and video-generation papers when they have explicit 3D consistency, reconstruction-based state, or embodied interaction relevance
- robotics and VLM/LLM-agent papers when 3D scene state is central to grounding, planning, or simulation

### Usually exclude

- generic 3D generation papers with no embodied, reconstructive, physical, part-level, articulated, or simulation angle
- purely aesthetic 3D editing without relevance to geometry, assets, scenes, dynamics, or interaction
- highly specialized 3DGS compression, acceleration, or rendering papers unless they are needed for online/embodied deployment
- general SLAM papers that do not materially help dense 3D reconstruction or embodied scene state
- unverified papers, rumor-like projects, placeholders, or entries without a reliable public source

## Source priority

When adding or updating entries, use sources in this order:
1. official project page, official code repository, or official dataset page
2. arXiv, conference, journal, OpenReview, or proceedings page
3. lab/author pages
4. high-quality awesome lists named in the README acknowledgements
5. Google Scholar / Semantic Scholar citation graph around canonical entries

For daily candidate discovery, routinely scan:
- this repository's [arXiv Daily](arXiv_daily/README.md) archive, especially its newest monthly entries and topic sections
- [jiangranlv/robotics_arXiv_daily](https://github.com/jiangranlv/robotics_arXiv_daily)
- [Vincentqyw/cv-arxiv-daily](https://github.com/Vincentqyw/cv-arxiv-daily)
- [chang-xinhai/AI-Conference-Paper-Lists](https://github.com/chang-xinhai/AI-Conference-Paper-Lists/tree/main/data/normalized), with a full pass over every normalized JSON file for the current and previous publication years rather than title-only spot checks

Treat these automated feeds and normalized conference records only as candidate-discovery and scanning sources, never as final factual evidence. For every candidate, return to arXiv and the official project, code, dataset, conference, or lab page to verify the title, date, venue, institution, links, contribution, and embodied-3DV relevance before adding it.

### arXiv Daily maintenance

`arXiv_daily/` provides durable coverage for papers whose titles or author language are easy to miss in ad-hoc searching. It is generated from six broad query families—data perception, representation, reconstruction, generation, embodiment/world models, and datasets/infrastructure—and applies local topic rules before storage.

- Treat it as a **candidate source**, not a quality ranking or automatic inclusion list.
- Keep the fetcher on its scheduled two-times-daily workflow with a 14-day lookback; the overlap catches delayed arXiv indexing and late metadata changes.
- Keep `data/papers.json`, the generated `README.md`, and `sections/*.md` in sync by using `scripts/fetch_arxiv.py`; do not hand-edit generated files.
- When changing queries or regex rules, add/adjust a focused test in `arXiv_daily/tests/`, regenerate the archive, and run both the unit tests and `scripts/validate_archive.py`.
- Keep known important in-scope papers in `validation.required_topics` so a future rule change cannot silently drop them. SeeClear (`2603.19547`) is the initial regression case.

If multiple sources disagree, prefer the most official public source.

## Verification rule for new entries

Do **not** add an entry unless it has a sufficiently reliable canonical public source.

Minimum bar for inclusion:
- a canonical paper URL such as arXiv / conference page / journal page / OpenReview page,
- and/or an official project page, dataset page, or GitHub repo from the authors / lab / organization.

If a candidate cannot be verified with enough confidence:
- do **not** add it to `README.md`
- do **not** guess missing metadata, URLs, venues, dates, or affiliations
- do **not** include partially confirmed or rumor-like items just because they seem relevant

When in doubt, exclude first and wait for a reliable source.

## Entry format

Each subsection should use the same compact table schema:

| Date | Keywords | Institute (first) | Paper / Resource | Publication | Others |
| :--: | :------: | :---------------: | :--------------- | :---------: | :----: |

### Column rules

- `Date`: if a work has an arXiv record, always use the initial `v1` submission date shown by arXiv, not a revision date, acceptance date, conference date, project-page launch, code release, or local-time conversion. If no arXiv record exists, use the official conference or journal publication date. Use `YYYY-MM` or `YYYY` only when that canonical source does not publish a precise day.
- `Keywords`: short tags only; keep them scannable.
- `Institute (first)`: first institution / lab / company only, concise and normalized.
- `Paper / Resource`: title linked to the canonical paper or resource URL.
- `Publication`: venue name such as `CVPR 2025`, `ICLR 2026`, `SIGGRAPH 2024`, `arXiv`, `Website`, `GitHub`, or `Dataset`.
- `Others`: compact links such as `project`, `github`, `dataset`, `benchmark`, `docs`, `survey`, `paper`.

## Sorting rules

- Sort every subsection by `Date` descending.
- Newer entries must appear above older ones.
- If only month or year is public, place the row consistently relative to other rows with known dates.

## Overlap policy

Controlled duplication is allowed.

Examples:
- PAGE-4D may appear in both `3D Reconstruction` and `Embodiment & World Models`.
- ArtGS may appear in both `3D Generation` and `Robotics Integration & LLM Agents`.
- Infinigen may appear in both `Scene-Level Generation` and `Datasets, Benchmarks & Infrastructure`.
- a dataset paper may appear in both the method section and the dataset section if both roles are important.

When duplicating an entry:
- keep the metadata consistent across placements
- adjust `Keywords` only if needed to explain the local role
- do not create unnecessary variant titles

## Dataset metadata guidance

For dataset and benchmark entries, preserve as much of the following as possible in keywords or compact `Others` links:
- input: monocular, sparse view, dense view, RGB-D, LiDAR, event, structured light, panoramic, fisheye, multi-view video
- target: depth, normals, point map, mesh, 3DGS, 4DGS, NeRF/SDF, semantic map, instance map, articulated object, URDF, scene graph
- scale: number of objects, scenes, trajectories, videos, frames, annotations, or environments when canonical sources make it explicit
- domain: object-level, scene-level, indoor, outdoor, driving, human, articulated, procedural, synthetic, real scans, robotics
- access: HuggingFace, Google Drive, GitHub, official download, benchmark server, simulator asset library

Use compact summaries in the table itself and keep verbose explanation out of the main row.

## Maintenance workflow

### News policy

Do **not** add `News` entries for routine paper/resource updates.

Only update `News` for major changes or milestone-level progress, such as:
- repository initialization
- adding a large new module, major top-level section, or substantial taxonomy expansion
- major restructuring that changes how readers navigate the list

Adding a few papers, fixing metadata, or refreshing links should not create a `News` item.
A deep audit or bulk paper refresh is still routine content maintenance and does not qualify by itself.

When adding entries:
1. decide the primary section first
2. check whether the resource should also appear in a second section
3. normalize the six metadata columns
4. insert in descending date order
5. update the Table of Contents only if headings changed
6. keep the README readable; do not over-tag

When reorganizing:
- prefer adding or refining subsections over inventing many new top-level sections
- keep the user-approved top-level section names unchanged unless explicitly asked

## Commit conventions

Use Conventional Commits.

Recommended types for this repository:
- `docs:` content additions or edits in `README.md` / `AGENTS.md`
- `feat:` meaningful new section or structural capability in the awesome list
- `refactor:` taxonomy reorganization without changing the underlying factual content
- `fix:` broken links, date corrections, venue fixes, naming fixes, anchor fixes
- `chore:` maintenance-only cleanup

Recommended examples:
- `docs(agents): define embodied 3dv curation rules`
- `docs(readme): add streaming reconstruction and articulated generation`
- `refactor(readme): reorganize world models around reconstruction and dynamics`
- `fix(readme): correct page4d venue and project links`

## What to avoid

- Do not add back UMI-specific scope or UMI-only taxonomy.
- Do not revert to a multi-file `contents/` structure.
- Do not add long prose summaries for every paper.
- Do not turn the repo into a general 3D generation, 3DGS, NeRF, SLAM, or robot-learning survey.
- Do not introduce inconsistent table schemas across sections.
- Do not add entries without checking their embodied-3DV relevance.
- Do not add placeholder links such as `https://github.com/` or fake arXiv identifiers.

## Quick checklist before finishing a change

- Is the entry clearly relevant to embodied 3DV core or strong adjacent scope?
- Is it in the right section?
- Should it also appear in another section?
- Does the row use the six required columns?
- Is the date normalized and ordering correct?
- Are `Paper / Resource` and `Others` links canonical and working?
- Does the change preserve the single-README architecture?
