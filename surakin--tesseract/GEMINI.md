# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What This Is

Tesseract is a cross-platform desktop Matrix/chat client. The core networking is Rust (using `matrix-sdk`), exposed to C++ via a `cxx` FFI bridge. Platform-specific UIs are written in C++ targeting Win32 (Windows), AppKit (Objective-C++, macOS), Qt6 Widgets, or GTK4 (Linux).

## Build Commands

Per-platform prerequisites, the full preset list, the `-DTESSERACT_UI=` override, and build internals (Corrosion, bundled SQLite, rustls, link strategy) live in [docs/BUILD.md](docs/BUILD.md). The day-to-day loop:

```bash
cmake --preset linux-debug              # full preset list in docs/BUILD.md; builds GTK4 + Qt6
cmake --build build/linux-debug
./build/linux-debug/ui/linux-qt/tesseract    # Qt6 UI
./build/linux-debug/ui/linux-gtk/tesseract   # GTK4 UI

# macOS (pick the preset matching your CPU):
cmake --preset macos-appkit-arm64-debug
cmake --build build/macos-appkit-arm64-debug
open build/macos-appkit-arm64-debug/ui/macos/Tesseract.app
```

## Architecture

```text
sdk/         ← Rust crate: matrix-sdk wrapper + cxx FFI bridge
client/      ← C++ static library: high-level C++ API over the Rust FFI
ui/
  shared/    ← tesseract_tk: cross-platform widget toolkit + shared views
    tk/        ← Canvas / Widget / Layout / Host abstractions (+ genuinely shared
                  GStreamer video/capture); per-platform backend impls
                  (canvas_*/host_*/audio_*/video_*/screen_capture_*) live in each
                  ui/<platform>/tk/, compiled into that platform's own target
    views/     ← MainAppWidget (root widget tree); LoginView, BrandView;
                  RoomListView, RoomView, MessageListView, ComposeBar;
                  ThreadView, ThreadListView (right-side panel inside RoomView);
                  EmojiPicker, StickerPicker, AccountPicker;
                  ImageViewerOverlay, VideoViewerOverlay, ShortcodePopup;
                  SettingsView, JoinRoomView, UserInfo;
                  RecoveryBanner, VerificationBanner;
                  html_spans (HTML→TextSpan), map_tiles, media_utils
                  (Markdown→HTML lives in client/src/markdown.cpp, Rust-backed)
                  shared bases: ListPopupBase, MediaOverlayBase, TabbedGridPicker;
                  MessageListView collaborators (per-concern, behavior-preserving
                  split): TimelineMediaController, TimelineVideoPlaylist,
                  LocationMapPanner, RoomSwitchGateKeeper, UrlPreviewCardDisplay,
                  LinkLayoutCache, SpoilerRevealer, ReadReceiptTracker
  windows/   ← Win32 executable (thin shell) + its tk/ backend (+ third_party/bettertext text control)
  macos/     ← AppKit executable (.app bundle, thin shell) + its tk/ backend
  linux-qt/  ← Qt6 Widgets executable (thin shell) + its tk/ backend
  linux-gtk/ ← GTK4 executable (thin shell) + its tk/ backend
```

### Layer responsibilities

**`sdk/` (Rust)** — All async I/O lives here. A `tokio` runtime runs in background threads. The `cxx` bridge (`sdk/src/lib.rs`) exposes a synchronous C API. `client.rs` wraps `matrix-sdk` for login, sync, and messaging; `oauth.rs` implements the RFC 8252 loopback redirect OAuth flow.

**`client/` (C++)** — `tesseract::Client` (Pimpl) wraps the Rust FFI. `tesseract::IEventHandler` is the interface UIs implement to receive async callbacks (room updates, sync events, session saves). `tesseract::SessionStore` handles platform-specific persistence of the session JSON and the per-account matrix-sdk store. Account data lives under `data_dir()` (`%APPDATA%/Tesseract/` on Windows, `~/Library/Application Support/Tesseract/` on macOS, `~/.local/share/tesseract/` on Linux — XDG state, not config); only `app_settings.json` lives in `config_dir()` (`~/.config/tesseract/` on Linux). `data_dir()` equals `config_dir()` on Windows/macOS, which have no such split.

**`ui/shared/` (C++)** — `tesseract_tk` is the cross-platform UI toolkit. It owns drawing, layout, hit-test, focus, and keyboard. `tk::Canvas` is the abstract 2D backend (D2D on Win32, QPainter on Qt6, Cairo+Pango on GTK4, CoreGraphics+CoreText on macOS). `tk::Host` is the per-platform integration surface (repaint scheduling, post-to-UI, native edit overlays). Shared widget classes live under `tk/`; shared views live under `views/` (see architecture diagram above for the full list). Text input stays native via `tk::NativeTextField` / `tk::NativeTextArea` overlays so IME and selection behave correctly per-OS.

**`ui/shared/app/` (C++)** — `ShellBase` holds all platform-agnostic shell state (accounts, rooms, image caches, worker threads, sync state) as `protected` members with pure-virtual hooks (`post_to_ui_`, `on_rooms_updated_`, `on_media_bytes_ready_`, etc.) and a set of virtual no-ops that each shell overrides (`handle_timeline_reset_ui_`, `on_room_list_state_ui_`, …). `EventHandlerBase : IEventHandler` marshals every SDK callback to the UI thread via `shell->post_to_ui_()` then calls the corresponding `handle_*_ui_()` virtual. Qt6 / GTK4 / Win32 shells inherit `ShellBase` directly; the macOS shell uses composition (`MainWindowController` holds `std::unique_ptr<MacShell>` where `MacShell : public ShellBase`) and exposes protected members to ObjC++ code via C++ `using` declarations in a `public:` section of `MacShell`. Cohesive subsystems are being split out of `ShellBase` into collaborators (`AccountManager`, `ThreadPanelController`; the media-fetch `MediaController` is the next planned cut — see `docs/TODO-phase5-remaining.md`); when extracting, keep shell-read fields (e.g. `thread_panel_`, `current_thread_root_`) on `ShellBase` so the four shells compile untouched.

**`ui/*/` (C++)** — Each platform target is a thin native shell that owns the window/menu/AX surface and mounts one or more `tk::*::Surface`s hosting shared views. Each shell implements `IEventHandler`. Because Rust callbacks arrive on worker threads, the shells route through `tk::Host::post_to_ui`, which is backed by `QueuedConnection` (Qt6), `g_idle_add` (GTK4), `PostMessage` (Win32), and `dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue())` (macOS).

### Key API surface (`client/include/tesseract/`)

- `Client::begin_oauth()` / `Client::await_oauth()` — two-phase OAuth: first call returns the auth URL (open in browser), second blocks until the loopback redirect completes.
- `Client::start_sync()` / `Client::stop_sync()` — background sync loop.
- `Client::send_message()`, `Client::list_rooms()`, `Client::room_messages()` — core messaging.
- `IEventHandler::on_session_saved(json)` — called on token refresh; persist the JSON to resume sessions without re-login.

## Running Tests

### Rust unit tests (standalone — no C++ required)

```bash
cargo test -p tesseract-sdk-ffi
```

### C++ tests via CMake / ctest

```bash
cmake --preset linux-debug
cmake --build build/linux-debug
ctest --test-dir build/linux-debug --output-on-failure
```

Each Catch2 `TEST_CASE` is registered as a separate ctest test. See [docs/BUILD.md](docs/BUILD.md) for why these need no extra toolchain wiring and how the test executable links the full stack.

## Roadmap

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for pending work, known gaps, and open design decisions. Completed work is in [CHANGES.md](CHANGES.md).

## Code Style

See [STYLE.md](STYLE.md) for formatting and naming conventions that apply across all C++ and Rust code in this repo.

## Workflow

Never commit or push changes without explicit confirmation from the user that the change has been tested and works as expected.

Never submit anything — commit, push, PR, or any outward-facing action — unless the user explicitly requests it. A request to *make* or *update* something (code, docs, config) is never authorization to submit it. When in doubt, present the changes and wait.

When presenting options or asking a question, there is no timeout. If the user does not answer, wait forever — do not pick an option, assume an answer, or proceed on a default. A question or choice is only resolved by the user's actual response.

When investigating a bug or unexpected behavior, always offer the user the chance to set breakpoints before proceeding. Pause and ask: "Would you like to set any breakpoints before I continue?" — this lets the user inspect state at key points rather than relying solely on log output or re-runs.

NEVER run the app yourself (launching a built binary/bundle, driving it, etc.) unless the user explicitly requests it. Taking screen captures or using screen/window automation (e.g. `screencapture`, `osascript`/System Events, accessibility APIs) without the user's authorization is FORBIDDEN — the display is the user's real, live desktop, not an isolated sandbox. A clean build is sufficient confirmation on its own; only launch or drive the app when the user explicitly asks for a live/visual check.

## Internationalisation

Every user-visible string in C++ **must** be wrapped in `tk::tr()` (singular), `tk::trn()` (plural), or `tk::trf()` (interpolated). Never pass a raw string literal directly to a widget or label where it will be displayed to the user.

```cpp
// Wrong
dev_group->add_widget(std::make_unique<tk::Label>("Microphone"));

// Correct
dev_group->add_widget(std::make_unique<tk::Label>(tk::tr("Microphone")));
```

After adding new strings, add the corresponding `msgid`/`msgstr` entries to every `.po` file under `i18n/` (currently `es.po` and `pseudo.po`). Strings added without `.po` entries will silently fall back to English and will never be translated.

Include `ui/shared/tk/i18n.h` to access `tk::tr`, `tk::trn`, and `tk::trf`.

## Shared vs Platform Code

Always implement new functionality in `ui/shared/` (`tk/` or `views/`) rather than duplicating it across platform shells. Platform shells (`ui/windows/`, `ui/linux-qt/`, `ui/linux-gtk/`, `ui/macos/`) should contain only what is genuinely platform-specific: native window/menu management, OS API calls, and thin wiring to the shared layer. If you find yourself writing the same logic in two or more shells, that logic belongs in `ui/shared/`.
