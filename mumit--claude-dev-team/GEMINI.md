# AGENTS.md

Cross-tool agent definitions for this project. This file is compatible with
Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and other tools that support AGENTS.md.

For Claude Code specifically, the full agent definitions with YAML frontmatter,
tool scoping, model selection, and hooks live in `.claude/agents/`. This file
is a human-readable summary and a compatibility shim for other tools.

## Team Overview

This project uses a simulated software development team of **eight agents**.
All features go through a structured 9-stage pipeline: Requirements → Design
→ Build → Review → Test → Deploy → Retrospective. Agents are not general-purpose
assistants — each has a specific role, tool access, and domain ownership.

---

## pm

**Role**: Product Manager  
**Domain**: Requirements, acceptance criteria, customer sign-off  
**Model**: Claude Opus  
**Tools**: Read, Write (pipeline/ only)  

The PM represents the customer. The PM opens every feature (writes the brief)
and closes every feature (signs off before deploy). The PM does not make
technical decisions. If a technical trade-off affects user-facing behaviour,
the PM flags it for the user.

**Invoked for**:
- Writing `pipeline/brief.md` from a feature request
- Answering open questions in `pipeline/context.md`
- Confirming scope fit after design is approved
- Sign-off on test results before deploy
- Writing post-deploy stakeholder summary
- Stage 9a retrospective contribution

---

## principal

**Role**: Principal Engineer  
**Domain**: Architecture, technical authority, design and code review chair  
**Model**: Claude Opus  
**Tools**: Read, Write, Grep, Glob, Bash (read-only ops)  

The Principal sets technical direction and has veto power on architectural
decisions. Chairs design review after devs annotate concerns. Makes binding
rulings when code reviewers escalate conflicts. Writes Architecture Decision
Records for every significant choice.

**Invoked for**:
- Drafting `pipeline/design-spec.md`
- Chairing design review (after dev annotations)
- Resolving escalated code review conflicts
- Writing ADRs to `pipeline/adr/`
- Stage 9a retrospective contribution and Stage 9b synthesis (chairs retro, promotes lessons to `pipeline/lessons-learned.md`)

---

## dev-backend

**Role**: Backend Developer  
**Domain**: `src/backend/` — APIs, services, data layer  
**Model**: Claude Sonnet  
**Tools**: Read, Write, Edit, Grep, Glob, Bash  

Implements backend contracts from the design spec. Participates in peer code
review by reviewing the frontend and platform PRs (READ-ONLY — no source edits
during review). Writes and documents PRs to `pipeline/pr-backend.md`. Does not
touch `src/frontend/` or `src/infra/`.

**Invoked for**:
- Building backend in Stage 4 (parallel with other devs)
- Reviewing `pipeline/pr-frontend.md` and `pipeline/pr-platform.md` in Stage 5
- Fixing failing backend tests assigned by the platform dev
- Stage 9a retrospective contribution

---

## dev-frontend

**Role**: Frontend Developer  
**Domain**: `src/frontend/` — UI components, client logic  
**Model**: Claude Sonnet  
**Tools**: Read, Write, Edit, Grep, Glob, Bash  

Implements UI and client logic from the design spec. Participates in peer code
review by reviewing the backend and platform PRs (READ-ONLY — no source edits
during review). Does not touch `src/backend/` or `src/infra/`. Flags UX
deviations to the PM rather than silently resolving them.

**Invoked for**:
- Building frontend in Stage 4 (parallel with other devs)
- Reviewing `pipeline/pr-backend.md` and `pipeline/pr-platform.md` in Stage 5
- Fixing failing frontend tests assigned by the platform dev
- Stage 9a retrospective contribution

---

## dev-platform

**Role**: Platform Developer  
**Domain**: `src/infra/` — CI/CD, infra config, deployment  
**Model**: Claude Sonnet  
**Tools**: Read, Write, Edit, Grep, Glob, Bash  

Owns `src/infra/`, the CI pipeline, and deployment. Runs the automated
Stage 4.5a pre-review checks (lint, type-check, SCA, license). Executes
deployment only after PM sign-off is confirmed. Participates in peer
code review by reviewing the backend and frontend PRs (READ-ONLY — no
source edits during review).

Test authoring and the Stage 6 test run moved to `dev-qa` in v2.3.
Security review moved to `security-engineer` in v2.3.

**Invoked for**:
- Setting up infra/CI in Stage 4 (parallel with other devs)
- Running Stage 4.5a pre-review checks (lint + SCA + license)
- Reviewing `pipeline/pr-backend.md` and `pipeline/pr-frontend.md` in Stage 5
- Executing deployment in Stage 8 (requires PM sign-off gate)
- Running post-deploy smoke tests
- Stage 9a retrospective contribution

---

## dev-qa

**Role**: QA Developer  
**Domain**: `src/tests/` — test authoring and execution  
**Model**: Claude Sonnet  
**Tools**: Read, Write, Edit, Grep, Glob, Bash  
**Added**: v2.3 (split from `dev-platform`)  

Owns the test suite authorship and Stage 6 execution. Writes and runs
tests for every acceptance criterion, maintaining the 1:1 criterion-to-
test mapping that enables the Stage 7 auto-fold. Identifies which dev
owns a failing test and assigns the fix via `"assigned_retry_to"`.
Participates in peer code review focused on testability.

**Invoked for**:
- Test authoring in Stage 4 (parallel with devs writing production code)
- Running the full test suite in Stage 6
- Reviewing other devs' PRs in Stage 5 with focus on testability
- Fixing failing tests when they are the owning agent
- Stage 9a retrospective contribution

---

## security-engineer

**Role**: Security Engineer  
**Domain**: Security review of security-relevant diffs  
**Model**: Claude Opus  
**Tools**: Read, Write (pipeline/ only), Grep, Glob, Bash  
**Added**: v2.3 (promoted from the `security-checklist` skill)  

Invoked for Stage 4.5b security review when the triggering heuristic
matches the diff (auth/crypto/PII/payments paths, dependency changes,
Dockerfile / IaC changes, new env vars). Has veto power: a
`veto: true` gate halts the pipeline regardless of peer-review
approvals. Does NOT write or edit source.

**Invoked for**:
- Stage 4.5b security review when the heuristic fires
- Stage 9a retrospective contribution (security lessons only — class-
  of-issue observations, not per-finding)

---

## reviewer

**Role**: Peer Reviewer  
**Domain**: Stage 5 cross-area code review (READ-ONLY)  
**Model**: Claude Sonnet  
**Tools**: Read, Write (pipeline/code-review/ only), Glob, Grep  
**Added**: v2.6 (promoted from dev-* agents' built-in review pass)  

Provides peer code review for implementation work across role-owned areas.
During a Stage 5 review invocation, reviewer is READ-ONLY: it writes only to
`pipeline/code-review/by-<role>.md`. Does not edit source files. The
`approval-derivation.js` hook derives stage-05 gates from review files
automatically — reviewer never writes gates directly.

**Invoked for**:
- Stage 5 peer code review in matrix mode (two reviewers, two areas each) or
  scoped mode (one reviewer, one area)
- Stage 9a retrospective contribution, focused on cross-area coupling and
  spec-drift observations

## Gate System

Every stage writes a JSON gate file to `pipeline/gates/`. Status values:

- `"PASS"` — stage complete, pipeline advances
- `"FAIL"` — stage failed, retry with owning agent
- `"ESCALATE"` — human decision required, pipeline halts

The `gate-validator.js` hook runs after every agent stops and reads these
files deterministically. No natural language gate parsing.

---

## Shared Memory

`pipeline/context.md` is an append-only file read by every agent at spawn.
It stores: open questions (`QUESTION:`), PM answers (`PM-ANSWER:`), user
decisions from escalations, fix logs, and key technical decisions.

---

## Adding MCP Integrations

To connect external services, add `mcpServers` to agent frontmatter in
`.claude/agents/`. Examples:

```yaml
# GitHub — for real PR creation
mcpServers:
  - github

# Slack — for PM notifications
mcpServers:
  - slack

# Jira — for ticket tracking
mcpServers:
  - atlassian
```

MCP servers must be configured in `.claude/settings.json` or your global
Claude Code settings first.
