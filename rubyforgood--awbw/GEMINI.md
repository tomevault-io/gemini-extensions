# This is a Ruby on Rails application.
<!-- Keep code style rules in sync with CLAUDE.md -->

For project overview, tech stack, architecture reference (models, controllers, services, testing), and more, read `AGENTS.md`.

## Setup

Full setup (bundle, npm, database create/migrate/seed):
```
bin/setup
```

If you just need frontend dependencies:
```
npm ci
```

## AI Instruction Files

When the user says "AI files", "AI instructions", "tell AI to", or "remember to always", these are the files.
If you notice the user repeatedly correcting the same pattern, suggest adding it to the AI files with a concrete proposal.

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `CLAUDE.md` | Coding rules and conventions (this file) |
| `AGENTS.md` | Architecture reference + project details |
| `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | Coding rules for Copilot (duplicated from CLAUDE.md — keep in sync) |
| `ai/` | Shell script shortcuts for common dev tasks |

## Related Files

When changing a model or controller, check whether these related files need updates:

| If you change... | Also check... |
|---|---|
| Model | Decorator, policy, factory, model spec |
| Controller | Policy, request spec, routing spec, views |
| View | System spec, Stimulus controller (if interactive) |
| Service | Service spec |
| Decorator | Decorator spec |
| Mailer (add/remove) | Mailer spec, mailer preview (follow existing patterns) |
| Add/remove model, concern, service, or gem | AGENTS.md |

## Code Style

- Use modern Ruby syntax
- Prefer early returns and guard clauses
- Avoid unnecessary and/or complex conditionals
- Prefer constants and scopes over magic strings
- Use safe navigation (`&.`) where appropriate
- Use `presence` over blank checks
- Use `Arel.sql` for raw SQL in order clauses
- Avoid `update_all` unless explicitly intended
- Prefer service objects under app/services/
- Prefer POROs over concerns when possible
- Use `after_commit` instead of `after_save` for side effects

## RuboCop (rubocop-rails-omakase)

This project uses rubocop-rails-omakase. All code MUST follow these rules:

### Strings
- **Always use double quotes** for strings: `"foo"` not `'foo'`

### Spacing
- **Spaces inside array brackets:** `[ a, b, c ]` not `[a, b, c]` (empty arrays: `[]`)
- **Spaces inside hash braces:** `{ a: 1, b: 2 }` not `{a: 1}` (empty hashes: `{}`)
- **Spaces inside block braces:** `foo { bar }` not `foo {bar}` (empty blocks: `foo { }`)
- **No spaces inside parens:** `foo(bar)` not `foo( bar )`
- **No spaces inside reference brackets:** `hash[:key]` not `hash[ :key ]`
- **Space before block braces:** `foo { }` not `foo{ }`

### Commas
- **No trailing commas** in arrays, hashes, or method arguments

### Indentation
- **2-space indentation**, no tabs
- **Consistent indentation** at normal level — do NOT indent methods under `private`/`protected`
- **Align `end` with the variable** in assignments:
  ```ruby
  result = if condition
    value
  end
  ```
- **Align `when` with `end`**, not with `case`

### Whitespace
- **No trailing whitespace** on any line
- **No trailing blank lines** at end of file
- **No empty lines** inside class, module, method, or block bodies

### Syntax
- **Use `%w[]` and `%i[]`** with square bracket delimiters (not parens)
- **Use modern hash syntax:** `{ key: value }` not `{ :key => value }`
- **No redundant returns** — omit `return` on last expression
- **Use `flat_map`** instead of `.map { }.flatten`
- **No redundant `.to_s`** inside string interpolation
- **Use `Foo.method`** not `Foo::method` for method calls
- **No parentheses around conditions:** `if foo` not `if (foo)`
- **No semicolons** to separate statements

## Casing

- **Use sentence case** for UI labels, headings, and display text — not title case
- "Age range" not "Age Range", "Art type" not "Art Type"
- Use `.underscore.humanize` to convert PascalCase model/type names to sentence case (e.g., `"AgeRange".underscore.humanize` → `"Age range"`)
- Avoid `.titleize` for user-facing labels — it produces title case
- **Exception:** when a category type name prefixes a category name (e.g., "Age Range: 3-5"), use `.titleize` for the prefix

## HTML/ERB Formatting

### Tag Attributes
- **Closing `>` on same line as last attribute** — do not put `>` on its own line
- When attributes span multiple lines, keep the closing `>` with the last attribute
- Example (GOOD):
  ```erb
  <div class="relative z-10 w-full bg-white text-gray-800 py-2 px-4"
       id="dropdown">
  ```
- Example (BAD):
  ```erb
  <div class="relative z-10 w-full bg-white text-gray-800 py-2 px-4"
       id="dropdown"
  >
  ```

## JavaScript

- ES6+ syntax, ESM imports/exports, `const`/`let` (no `var`)
- Use `const` for fixed values — not `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` constants (e.g., `const styleId = "foo"` not `const STYLE_ID = "foo"`)
- **Strongly prefer Stimulus** for JavaScript behavior — do not write raw/inline JS or jQuery
- **Always use Tailwind CSS** utility classes for styling — do not write custom CSS unless absolutely necessary
- **Prefer Font Awesome (free)** icons over inline SVGs — use `icon("fa-solid fa-foo")` helper. Inline SVGs are acceptable when a specific icon design is preferred.
- Prefer Turbo for navigation and form submissions before reaching for Stimulus
- Controller naming: `[name]_controller.js`
- Keep controllers focused and small

### Stimulus Conventions

Follow the [Stimulus Handbook](https://stimulus.hotwired.dev/handbook/introduction) and reference docs. Key rules:

**Targets over querySelector** — declare `static targets = [...]` and use `data-[controller]-target` attributes in views. Never use `this.element.querySelector` or `document.getElementById` to find elements that could be targets. Exception: elements outside the controller's scope (e.g., in a parent view).

**Values API for state** — use `static values = { name: Type }` for any state that persists or drives UI. Do not store state in instance variables when a value would work. Use `[name]ValueChanged()` callbacks for reactive updates instead of manual syncing.

**Actions over manual listeners** — use `data-action` attributes instead of `addEventListener` in `connect()`. Omit the event when it's the default for the element (`click` for buttons/links, `input` for inputs/textareas, `submit` for forms, `change` for selects). Use `@window` or `@document` suffixes for global events when possible (e.g., `resize@window->controller#layout`). Use action options like `:prevent` and `:stop` instead of calling `event.preventDefault()` in methods.

**Classes API for CSS** — use `static classes = [...]` when CSS classes need to be configurable from HTML. For standard Tailwind utilities used internally (e.g., `"hidden"`), hardcoding is acceptable.

**Outlets for cross-controller communication** — use `static outlets = [...]` to reference other controllers instead of `document.getElementById` or custom events when the relationship is stable.

**Lifecycle discipline** — every listener, timer, or observer created in `connect()` must be cleaned up in `disconnect()`. Store bound handler references so they can be removed. Use `initialize()` for one-time setup (e.g., binding functions).

**Target lifecycle callbacks** — use `[name]TargetConnected(element)` and `[name]TargetDisconnected(element)` to respond to dynamically added/removed targets (e.g., cocoon nested fields, Turbo streams).

**Visibility** — toggle the `hidden` class via `classList.toggle("hidden", condition)` instead of setting `style.display`. Use `class="hidden"` in HTML for initial hidden state, not `style="display:none"`.

## Migrations

- Name migration files using **UTC timestamps** (e.g., `20260228143000`), not sequential numbers (e.g., `20260228000007`)
- Multiple branches adding migrations on the same date will collide if they use sequential numbering
- **Migrations must be reversible** — always use explicit `up`/`down` methods instead of `change` when the rollback isn't trivially invertible. Guard `down` operations with `if_exists: true`, `column_exists?`, `index_exists?`, and `foreign_key_exists?` so rollbacks are idempotent and recover from partial failures

## Git

- Default branch is `main`
- Commit messages should explain why, not what
- CI runs via GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/`)
- **When rebasing onto main**, review incoming changes for their intent and flag any oversights — missing tests, incomplete migrations, broken assumptions, or conflicts between the two branches. Check both directions: schema/model changes on either branch that affect views, partials, or layouts on the other (e.g., main redesigned a table's CSS but your branch adds new columns to it, or vice versa)

## PRs

- **Push to a draft PR early** — push commits and create a draft PR (`gh pr create --draft`) as soon as work begins, rather than keeping changes in a local branch. Push on every commit.
- After completing work, **mark the PR ready** using `gh pr ready`
- **Do not rename branches after creating a PR** — deleting the old remote branch auto-closes the PR on GitHub, and the head ref cannot be changed after creation
- Use `docs/pull_request_template.md` for PR description structure
- Use bullet points, not paragraphs, when filling out each section
- Description must explain why the change was made, not just what
- Include screenshots for UI changes
- **On every push**, update the PR title and content to reflect the current diff — preserve any existing images/screenshots in the description
- **On every push**, update AI instruction files if the diff adds, removes, or renames anything tracked in AGENTS.md — specifically: Stimulus controllers, services, model/controller concerns, mailers, rake tasks, and directory file counts
- **On every push**, add PR review comments on notable lines of code — decisions, trade-offs, non-obvious logic, or anything a reviewer should understand. Use `gh api` to post line comments on the diff

## Testing

- **Bug fixes require a failing test first** — before writing any fix code, write a test that reproduces the bug and confirm it fails. Only then write the code to make it pass.
- Follow the red-green-refactor cycle: failing test, minimal fix, then refactor
- Be careful with system/JS tests — avoid patterns that lead to flakiness
