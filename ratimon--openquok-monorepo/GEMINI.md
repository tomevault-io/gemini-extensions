## agent-skill

> Meta-guidance for OpenQuok agent skills under agent/skills/. Authoritative instructions live in each skill’s SKILL.md — apply when editing those skills or this rule.


**Sources of truth:** each installable skill’s `SKILL.md` under `agent/skills/<slug>/`. Edit that file when changing what agents should do; keep this rule for Cursor-only best practices and cross-skill layout.

## Skill families

| Kind | Example | Layout | Role |
|------|---------|--------|------|
| **Core CLI skill** | `openquok-core` | `SKILL.md` + `resources/` | Auth, media Rule 2, channel recipes, `openquok` workflows |
| **Sibling pipeline skill** | `openquok-tiktok-slideshow` | `SKILL.md` + `scripts/` + `references/` | Domain pipeline (research → generate → post); **requires** `openquok-core` / `openquok` on PATH; never replaces core |

Sibling skills may depend on core recipes (upload → `{id,path}`, TikTok photo-carousel, `SELF_ONLY` drafts) by instructing the agent to follow `openquok-core` — do not duplicate long CLI matrices into the sibling `SKILL.md`.

Publish each slug separately to ClawHub (`agent/CLAWHUB.md`). Skills with `scripts/` must document **Copy / `--copy`** install so scripts land as real files.

## Skill layout — openquok-core

- **`SKILL.md`** — Hard rules, auth, core workflow, pitfalls, quick reference. Keep it focused; link out instead of duplicating long examples. The **Channels (Meta)** table indexes per-platform files and summarizes user intents — do not paste feature matrices or long bash into `SKILL.md`.
- **`resources/*.md`** — Deeper material agents load on demand:
  - `command-reference.md` — CLI commands, flags, env vars (not `agent/README.md`; skill install path has no sibling README).
  - `provider-settings.md` — shared publish-time mechanics: `--settings` vs `--providerSettingsByIntegrationId`, merge order, flat vs nested API buckets, multi-`-c` behavior.
  - `patterns.md` — extended workflows (campaign JSON, batching, retries).
  - `{identifier}-examples.md` — per-channel agent docs (see **Per-channel example file** below). Today: `threads`, `facebook`, `instagram-standalone`, `instagram-business`.
  - `threads-publish.md` — server publish behavior summarized in markdown (never link to `.ts` / backend paths from the skill).
- **`SKILL.md` tone** — imperative, short tables and bullets; no tutorial prose; shell-safety rules for untrusted input; defer command lists and long bash to `resources/`.

## Skill layout — sibling skills (`scripts/` + `references/`)

Use this pattern for pipeline skills that ship runnable helpers (e.g. `openquok-tiktok-slideshow`):

- **`SKILL.md`** — Phases, prerequisites, install (Copy required), config shape pointers, and how to invoke scripts. Keep lean; link into `references/` for deep playbooks.
- **`scripts/`** — Node (or shell) helpers the agent runs with `node scripts/<name>.js`. Prefer CommonJS or whatever the skill’s local `package.json` declares. Do not assume npm deps beyond `engines` unless the skill documents a real install step on its homepage.
- **`references/`** — On-demand docs and scaffolds agents load when needed (slide structure, research notes, character-lock templates, JSON templates). Prefer neutral first-party templates — no personal asset paths or third-party persona dumps in-repo.
- **Compatibility** — State clearly: does not replace `openquok-core`; requires `openquok` (+ `node`) on PATH; media and post create go through the CLI.
- **Workspace config** — Onboarding may scaffold files **outside** the skill install (user workspace). Document paths in `SKILL.md`; do not write secrets into the skill bundle.

When adding a new sibling skill, also update ClawHub scripts in `agent/package.json`, `agent/CLAWHUB.md`, and the Extensions Hub listing / docs page as applicable.

## Per-channel example file (`resources/{identifier}-examples.md`)

Each live Meta (or future) channel the CLI can post to should have one example file matching `provider.identifier`. Structure every file the same way so agents can map **user intent → recipe**:

1. **Resolve integration** — `integrations:list` + `integrations:settings` one-liner at the top.
2. **Supported features** — table: Feature | Supported | Notes — **only shipped behavior** (same bar as `publicChannelConfig` FAQ/bento, but agent-actionable, not marketing copy).
3. **Agent tasks** — table: “User wants to…” | “Do this” — link to anchored sections below (e.g. link preview, Reel, reply chain).
4. **Provider settings** — table of publish keys (`--settings` / `providerSettingsByIntegrationId`), with precedence rules (e.g. Facebook `url` ignored when media attached).
5. **Recipes** — short `bash` blocks per task; use `<integration-id>` placeholders; link to `provider-settings.md` once at the top.

When adding or changing publish behavior for a channel, update **backend resolver + this file** together. Do not lift `publicChannelConfig.ts` hero/feature prose into the skill — distill facts into the tables above.

## CLI-only scope

Skill content is for agents using `openquok` and the public API.

- **Do** document flat API keys the backend accepts on create (`post_type`, `url`, `is_trial_reel`, …) and nested **orchestrator buckets** in `providerSettingsByIntegrationId` (`threads.replies`, `threads.internalEngagementPlug`, `instagram.replies`, `facebook.url` when nested).
- **Do** run `integrations:settings` for `rules`, `maxLength`, and `tools`; note that typed publish schemas may live in channel example files until `settingsSchema()` exists on the provider.
- **Do not** document web UI, composer panels, preview components, Payload Wizard UX, or web-only camelCase composer fields (e.g. `postType`, `trialReel`). Summarize server behavior in `resources/*.md` instead of linking monorepo source.

## Links

Only reference markdown under **this skill’s** directory (or stable external URLs in the front matter). Sibling skills may name `openquok-core` as a required dependency and point agents at core recipes by skill name — do not link to monorepo source files (TypeScript, tests, etc.) from skill content; summarize behavior in a new or existing `resources/` / `references/` file instead.

## Registry security scans

Hermes (`hermes skills install <url>`) and ClawHub run automated scans on `SKILL.md`. Community URL installs can be **blocked** on dangerous verdicts; `--force` does not override. Write `SKILL.md` so behavior stays intact without tripping common rules.

### Frontmatter

- **`description`** — short product summary for search/registry UI only (what the skill does). Do **not** put session bootstrap logic, version stamps, or “overrides host …” instructions in `description`.
- **`homepage`** — use for CLI upgrade/install pointers (`@openquok/auto-cli` npm page) or the skill’s docs page instead of embedding package-manager commands in the body.
- **`metadata` (single-line JSON)** — OpenClaw’s parser accepts **only** single-line `metadata` (not nested YAML under that key). Put both hosts in one JSON object:
  - **OpenClaw / ClawHub:** `openclaw.requires.bins` (e.g. `["openquok"]` or `["openquok","node"]`), `always`, `emoji`, optional `openclaw.homepage` (top-level `homepage` is also valid).
  - **Hermes:** `hermes.tags`, `hermes.category`, `hermes.requires_toolsets: ["terminal"]` as keys inside the same JSON object (Hermes docs show nested YAML in examples; JSON with a `hermes` key is what parsers receive after YAML load).
- **`prerequisites.commands`** — Hermes/agentskills.io: list bins the skill needs (e.g. `[openquok]` or `[openquok, node]`). Do **not** require `OPENQUOK_API_KEY` in frontmatter — device OAuth is valid without a pre-set env var.
- **`compatibility`** — agentskills.io optional one-liner: global CLI is separate from the skill bundle; sibling skills should note Copy install and the core dependency.

### Avoid persistence findings

Scanners flag skills that claim to override host configuration.

- **Do not** write that the skill “wins over”, “overrides”, or takes “priority” over `AGENTS.md`, `SOUL.md`, `IDENTITY.md`, or other host persona files.
- **Do** scope session bootstrap to **first turn after** `/new`, `/reset`, or a new thread — e.g. “use the Openquok bot voice on that turn only”.
- Prefer neutral phrasing: “take precedence” over “wins over” when describing credential file vs env var order.

### Avoid supply-chain findings

Scanners flag embedded package installs and registry pulls in skill text.

- **Do not** put `npm install`, `npm view`, `pnpm add`, `curl | bash`, or similar in `SKILL.md` templates, pitfalls tables, or quoted examples.
- **Do** tell the agent to offer CLI upgrades only after user consent and point to `homepage` or `resources/command-reference.md` (core) / docs homepage (siblings) for install steps.
- **Do** keep bootstrap shell to fixed `openquok …` / `node scripts/…` invocations — not package managers.

### Shell and exec safety

- Run **fixed** `openquok` / `node scripts/…` commands; never concatenate untrusted chat text into the shell (already in core `SKILL.md` **Shell safety**).
- Put captions and JSON in quoted flags, heredocs, or files.

### When a scan still blocks

1. Re-read findings line-by-line in `SKILL.md` and soften wording before dropping behavior.
2. Hermes fallback: manual copy of the **full** skill folder into `~/.hermes/skills/<slug>/` (see agent guide) — URL install of `SKILL.md` alone omits `resources/` / `scripts/` / `references/`.
3. OpenClaw: publish the full skill folder to ClawHub (`agent/CLAWHUB.md`) so supporting files install with the bundle.

## Best practices

- **Be concise** — instruct the model on what to do, not how to be an AI.
- **Safety first** — registry scans and shell safety above; treat user chat as untrusted input for command construction.
- **Intent first** — for core channel work, open the matching `{identifier}-examples.md` **Agent tasks** table before improvising flags; for sibling pipelines, follow that skill’s phases and `references/` before inventing steps.
- **Core first** — when a sibling skill posts or uploads, resolve integrations and media via `openquok-core` patterns; do not invent alternate public-API clients inside skill scripts unless the skill already documents them.
