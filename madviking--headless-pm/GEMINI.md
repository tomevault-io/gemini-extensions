# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Environment Setup

### Automated Setup (Recommended)
```bash
# Run universal setup script - handles platform-specific requirements
./setup/universal_setup.sh

# This will:
# - Detect your architecture (ARM64 for native Mac, x86_64 for Claude Code)
# - Create the appropriate virtual environment (venv or claude_venv)
# - Install correct package versions for your platform
# - Create .env from env-example if needed
```

### Manual Setup (if needed)
```bash
# For LLM agents (x86_64), use claude_venv:
python -m venv claude_venv
source claude_venv/bin/activate
pip install pydantic==2.11.7 pydantic-core==2.33.2
pip install -r setup/requirements.txt

# For native Mac (ARM64), use standard venv:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r setup/requirements.txt

# Configure environment
cp env-example .env
# Edit .env with API keys and database configuration

# Initialize database
python -m src.cli.main init
python -m src.cli.main seed  # Optional: add sample data
```

### Running the Application

#### Quick Start (Recommended)
```bash
# Activate your virtual environment first
source venv/bin/activate  # or source claude_venv/bin/activate

# Use the automated start script (checks environment, DB, starts server)
./start.sh
```

#### Manual Start
```bash
# Run API server
bash start.sh
```

The `start.sh` script automatically:
- ✅ Validates Python 3.11+ requirement  
- ✅ Checks required packages are installed
- ✅ Creates .env from env-example if needed
- ✅ Tests database connection
- ✅ Initializes database if needed
- ✅ Checks port availability
- ✅ Starts server with proper configuration
- ✅ Starts only services with defined ports in .env

**Service Port Configuration:**
- Services are only started if their port is defined in `.env`
- To skip a service, remove or comment out its port variable:
  - `SERVICE_PORT` - API server (default: 6969)
  - `MCP_PORT` - MCP server (default: 6968) 
  - `DASHBOARD_PORT` - Web dashboard (default: 3001)

**Note**: Activate your virtual environment before running the start script.

## Testing

### Running Tests

**IMPORTANT**: Full test suite requires **at least 3 minutes** to complete (155 tests in ~2.5 min)

```bash
# IMPORTANT: Use the appropriate virtual environment for your platform
# For Claude Code (x86_64):
source claude_venv/bin/activate

# For native Mac (ARM64):
source venv/bin/activate

# Run all tests with coverage (requires 3+ minutes)
timeout 300s python -m pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing

# Quick unit tests only (~30 seconds)
python -m pytest tests/unit/ -v

# Run specific test files
python -m pytest tests/test_api.py -v
python -m pytest tests/test_models.py -v

# Run tests without coverage (faster)
python -m pytest -q

# Run specific test patterns
python -m pytest -k "test_name_pattern"

# View test durations to identify slow tests
python -m pytest -v --durations=20
```

### Test Coverage Status
- **Current Tests**: Client integration tests
- **Test Location**: `tests/test_headless_pm_client.py`
- **Additional Testing**: Comprehensive test suite planned

### Test Architecture Notes
- API tests use temporary file-based SQLite databases (not in-memory) to avoid connection issues
- All models, enums, and services have comprehensive test coverage
- Tests include document creation, mention detection, service registry, and task lifecycle

## Architecture Overview

Headless PM is a REST API for LLM agent task coordination with document-based communication. Key architectural decisions:

1. **Document-Based Communication**: Agents communicate via documents with @mention support
2. **Service Registry**: Track running services with heartbeat monitoring
3. **Git Workflow Integration**: Major tasks use feature branches with PRs, minor tasks commit directly to main
4. **Changes Polling**: Efficient polling endpoint for agents to get updates since last check
5. **Role-Based System**: Five roles (frontend_dev, backend_dev, qa, architect, pm) with multiple agents per role
6. **Task Complexity**: Major/minor classification determines Git workflow (PR vs direct commit)
7. **Comprehensive Testing**: 78 tests with 71% coverage including full API testing

### Enhanced Features
- **Epic/Feature/Task Hierarchy**: Three-level project organization
- **Documents Table**: Agent communication with mention detection
- **Service Registry**: Track microservices with heartbeat monitoring and ping URLs
- **Mentions System**: @username notifications across documents and tasks
- **Changes API**: Polling endpoint returning changes since timestamp
- **Task Complexity**: Major/minor enum driving branching strategies
- **Connection Types**: Distinguish between MCP and client connections
- **Task Comments**: Collaborative discussion on tasks with @mentions
- **Python Client Helper**: Complete CLI interface (`headless_pm_client.py`)
- **MCP Server**: Natural language interface for Claude Code
- **Database Migrations**: Schema evolution support
- **Web Dashboard**: Real-time project overview with analytics and monitoring
- **Port-based Service Control**: Services only start if their port is defined in .env

- Client integration tests implemented in `test_headless_pm_client.py`

## Python Client Helper

The `headless_pm_client.py` provides a complete CLI interface to the API:

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Register an agent
./headless_pm_client.py register --agent-id "dev_001" --role "backend_dev" --level "senior"

# Work with epics/features/tasks
./headless_pm_client.py epics create --name "Authentication" --description "User auth system"
./headless_pm_client.py tasks next --role backend_dev --level senior
./headless_pm_client.py tasks lock 123 --agent-id "dev_001"
./headless_pm_client.py tasks status 123 --status "dev_done" --agent-id "dev_001"

# Communicate with team
./headless_pm_client.py documents create --type "update" --title "Progress" \
  --content "Completed login API @qa_001 please test" --author-id "dev_001"
  
# Check for updates
./headless_pm_client.py mentions --agent-id "dev_001"
./headless_pm_client.py changes --since 1736359200 --agent-id "dev_001"
```

### Client Features
- Automatic `.env` file loading for API keys
- Comprehensive help with `--help` flag
- Support for all API endpoints
- Embedded agent instructions
- Multiple API key sources (checks in priority order)

## Connection Types

Agents can register with two connection types:

### CLIENT Connection
- Default for agents using the API directly
- Use when registering via `headless_pm_client.py` or direct API calls
- Example: `./headless_pm_client.py register --agent-id "dev_001" --role "backend_dev"`

### MCP Connection  
- Automatically set when using MCP server
- Used by Claude Code integration with **multi-client coordination**
- **Auto-Discovery**: Connects to existing APIs before starting new ones
- **Reference Counting**: Multiple Claude Code instances can safely share one API
- **Process Safety**: Only API starters perform cleanup (preserves existing APIs)
- Provides natural language interface
- Token usage tracking included
- Cross-platform coordination with atomic file operations

**Multi-Client Behavior**:
- First MCP client starts API if none exists
- Additional clients connect to existing API (no duplicate processes)
- API remains running until last MCP client disconnects
- Pre-existing APIs are never terminated by MCP clients

The connection type helps distinguish between different agent interfaces and enables appropriate features for each type.

### Memories
- 8000 port is for another service entirely, leave that alone!

## Changelog Maintenance

Always maintain `CHANGELOG.md` as part of every meaningful change. Guidelines:

- Update `CHANGELOG.md` in the same commit/PR as the code change.
- Group notes by change type: Added, Changed, Fixed, Removed, Deprecated, Security, Documentation, Breaking Changes.
- Prefer concise, user-facing summaries over raw commit messages.
- Mark breaking changes explicitly and include upgrade/migration notes.
- Until version tags exist, group by date headings. Once tags are introduced, switch to version-based headings.
- If a change alters behavior or interfaces (API endpoints, CLI, file layout), add an entry even if no user-visible feature is added.

Quick workflow

1. Make the change and write tests.
2. Edit `CHANGELOG.md`, add an entry under today’s date with the appropriate category.
3. If the change is breaking, add a short “Breaking Changes” note and any steps needed.
4. Commit: include a clear message (conventional style preferred, e.g., `feat: ...`, `fix: ...`, `refactor: ...`, `docs: ...`, `chore: ...`, `perf: ...`, `test: ...`).
5. Open PR and ensure reviewers check the changelog entry.
