# VCVio — AI Agent Guide

Machine-checked cryptographic proofs in Lean, built on Mathlib.

## Fast Start

1. Run `lake exe cache get && lake build`.
2. Read `Examples/OneTimePad/Basic.lean` for a compact modern proof (correctness and privacy).
3. Choose the work area by task: use `VCVio/` for oracle/probability/program-logic work, `LatticeCrypto/` for lattice schemes and reductions, and `LatticeCryptoTest/` for vectors or differential tests.
4. If `𝒟` lemmas fail unexpectedly, check for `[OracleSpec.IsMeasureSpec spec]`
   and the required measurable spaces. The concrete `unifSpec` and `coinSpec`
   have native uniform-measure instances; other specs need a chosen interpretation.

`AGENTS.md` is the canonical guide. `CLAUDE.md` is a symlink to this file.

## Attribution, Headers, And Docstrings

Follow [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the repo's explicit attribution policy.

- New Lean files should use the standard copyright / license / authors header and a module docstring.
- For ordinary Lean source files, use the standard prologue layout: header, blank line, `module`, public imports, blank line, module docstring.
- Docstrings must be intrinsic and descriptive. Cross-reference live sibling definitions when helpful, but do not mention removed or renamed declarations, change history, or use reactive wording such as "replaces" or "renamed from".
- Preserve existing headers on routine edits.
- Only rewrite attribution when a file is genuinely new or materially replaced.
- Do not add a separate AI-attribution line.
- For inline section breaks within a Lean file, use Mathlib-style doc-comment headers `/-! ## Title -/` (or the multi-line `/-! ## Title \n\n explanation -/` form). **Do not use ASCII banners** such as `-- ====...===` flanking a `-- § Title` line. The `/-!` form is rendered by `doc-gen4`; ASCII banners are not, and they make the file feel artificially partitioned. If a section is large enough to want a loud header, it is usually large enough to want its own `namespace` or its own file. See *Section Headers Within A File* in [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Module Scopes

Active Lean libraries and tests use Lean's module system. Put declarations in a `public section`;
use `public meta section` for tactic and elaborator code. Existing ordinary source files use
`@[expose] public section` so pre-migration downstream definitional equalities remain available; new
files use plain `public section` and expose individual definitions with `@[expose]` where unfolding
is part of the intended API. The per-library count of broadly exposed files is a ceiling
(`scripts/check-expose-boundary.sh`, baseline `scripts/expose_boundary_baseline.tsv`): converting a
file lowers it, and raising it needs an explicit baseline change under review. Executable and
runtime implementation modules should use opaque `public section` when callers do not need to
unfold their definitions.

- Use `public import` for dependencies that form part of the module's transitive public surface and
  `public meta import` for exported tactic/elaborator dependencies.
- Use plain `import` for implementation-only dependencies. A proof module may use `import all` to
  access an unexposed implementation from the same dependency when proving its public API.
- Do not enable `backward.privateInPublic` or `backward.proofsInPublic`; resolve visibility and
  proof-metavariable issues directly.
- Keep the dormant `Interop` library outside this policy until it is migrated separately.

Section `variable` lines carry an instance assumption only when the theorems in scope share it:
Lean auto-includes an instance-implicit section variable in every theorem mentioning its types,
so a section-wide `[Fintype Chal] [Inhabited Chal] [SampleableType Chal]` that most theorems
ignore turns into an `omit [...] in` line before each of them. Put such assumptions on the
declarations that use them, or open a `section` around the block that shares them; never declare
one that another in scope implies (`[Finite X]` beside `[SampleableType X]`). `omit` is for a
genuine one-off. See *Section Variables* in [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) and gotcha 31.

## What This Project Is

VCVio is a framework for formal cryptographic proofs built around `OracleComp spec α`, the free monad on the polynomial functor induced by an oracle signature `OracleSpec ι := ι → Type`. Its universal fold `simulateQ impl : OracleComp spec α → r α` is the unique monad morphism extending any `impl : QueryImpl spec r` to the free monad. For `OracleComp`, `support` is definitionally `simulateQ` into `SetM` with queries interpreted by `Set.univ`; the primary `evalDist` / `𝒟[…]` semantics is a successful-output Mathlib `Measure`, while `evalSPMF` / `𝒮[…]`, `probOutput`, and `Pr[…]` form the discrete compatibility surface backed by `simulateQ` into `PMF` using `[IsProbabilitySpec spec]`. Uniform cardinality lemmas and the `support`/probability bridge use `[IsUniformSpec spec]`, which bundles `∀ t, Fintype (spec.Range t)`, `∀ t, Inhabited (spec.Range t)`, and uniform sampling. `ProbComp α := OracleComp unifSpec α` specializes to computations whose only oracle is uniform selection.

The repo also includes a first-class lattice cryptography library under `LatticeCrypto/`, built on top of the `VCVio` framework. That layer contains generic lattice algebra plus ML-DSA, ML-KEM, and Falcon specifications, security statements, concrete implementations, and tests; the native FFI bridges live in the separate `Extern/` library.

## Repo Map

- `VCVio/`: generic oracle-computation framework, program logic, crypto abstractions, and generic reductions.
- `VCVioCslib/`: optional cslib-backed non-uniform P/poly adapters; it is a separate Lake library
  so core `VCVio` remains backend-neutral.
- `ToMathlib/`: local Mathlib-facing utilities and lemmas intended to remain below the framework layer.
- `Extern/`: native FFI surface — the `@[extern]` bindings (SHA-3/SHAKE, ML-KEM, ML-DSA, Falcon) and the FFI-backed concrete instances that reach them. No proof library may import it; the backing `extern_lib`s become empty stubs when `third_party/` submodules are absent.
- `LatticeCrypto/`: lattice-specific algebra, hardness assumptions, scheme definitions, security theorems, and concrete implementations.
- `HashSig/`: hash-based signatures — SLH-DSA (SPHINCS+, FIPS 205) proof-level specs,
  component-level FIPS conformance results, and security-facing interfaces (no unforgeability
  theorem or complete FIPS conformance result yet). Peer of `LatticeCrypto/`; depends on
  `VCVio`/`ToMathlib` but nothing in those imports it back.
- `LatticeCryptoTest/`: ACVP vectors, executable regression tests, and cross-checks against native backends.
- `VCVioTest/`: framework smoke tests and test support modules.
- `VCVioWidgets/`: optional widget experiments and visualizations.
- `VCVioCslib/`: optional cslib-backed non-uniform P/poly certificates and security-game adapters.
  It stays outside the default library graph but participates in repository validation.
- `VCVioComplexity/`: optional isolated Lake package for the complexitylib-backed exact-machine
  substrate; it is not part of VCVio's default dependency graph.
- `Examples/`: compact framework examples such as OneTimePad, ElGamal, Schnorr, and program-logic tactic walkthroughs.
- `Interop/`: experimental bridges to Rust verification frontends (hax, aeneas). **Strict TCB isolation**: nothing in core VCVio depends on it. See `docs/agents/interop.md`.
- `csrc/`: C FFI shims used for differential testing against native ML-DSA, ML-KEM, and Falcon code.
- `third_party/`: native backends as git submodules; when they are not checked out (fresh clones, Lake dependency checkouts), the native `extern_lib` targets build as empty stub archives.

## Module Layering

For `VCVio/`:

```
ToMathlib → Prelude → EvalDist/Defs → OracleComp core → EvalDist bridge
  → {SimSemantics, QueryTracking, Constructions, Coercions, ProbComp}
  → {ProgramLogic, CryptoFoundations, CryptoFoundations/Asymptotics} → Examples
```

New files must respect this DAG. `EvalDist/` must never import from `OracleComp/`.

For `LatticeCrypto/`, the rough dependency direction is:

```
{Ring/*, DiscreteGaussian}
  → HardnessAssumptions
  → {MLDSA, MLKEM, Falcon}
  → Concrete implementations / security wrappers
  → Extern (FFI bindings + FFI-backed instances)
  → LatticeCryptoTest
```

Scheme-specific code in `LatticeCrypto/` may depend on `VCVio/CryptoFoundations`, but not the other way around.

The native FFI surface lives in `Extern/`: it may import `VCVio`, `LatticeCrypto`,
and `ToMathlib`, but no proof library (`VCVio/`, `ToMathlib/`, `LatticeCrypto/`,
`HashSig/`, `Examples/`, `VCVioWidgets/`, `Interop/`) may import `Extern.…`. That
keeps every proof library — and any downstream Lake project requiring VCVio —
link-safe when the `third_party/` submodules are absent. Enforced by
`scripts/check-extern-isolation.sh` on every PR.

For `Interop/`, the dependency contract is one-way:

```
Interop/{Hax,Aeneas,Rust}/  →  VCVio/, ToMathlib/, (Hax.…), (Aeneas.…)
```

`Interop/**` may **never** be imported from `VCVio/`, `LatticeCrypto/`,
`LatticeCryptoTest/`, `Examples/`, `ToMathlib/`, `Extern/`, `VCVioWidgets/`,
or `VCVioTest/`. This contract is enforced by
`scripts/check-interop-isolation.sh` and the
`Interop TCB Isolation` GitHub workflow on every PR.

## Critical Gotchas

1. **Probability assumptions are explicit for arbitrary specs.** `support` on `OracleComp spec` works without a probability interpretation. `evalSPMF` / `Pr[...]` need `[IsProbabilitySpec spec]`; direct `evalDist` / `𝒟[…]` need `[OracleSpec.IsMeasureSpec spec]` and an ambient `MeasurableSpace` on the result. Native uniform-measure instances are global for `unifSpec` and `coinSpec`. Uniform/cardinality lemmas and `support ↔ Pr[= _] ≠ 0` need `[IsUniformSpec spec]`. Use `IsUniformSpec.ofFintypeInhabited` when you have `[∀ t, Fintype (spec.Range t)] [∀ t, Inhabited (spec.Range t)]` and intend uniform semantics; the measure-native `IsUniformMeasureSpec.ofFiniteNonempty` needs only `Finite`/`Nonempty`. There are no bundled `spec.Fintype` / `spec.Inhabited` / `spec.DecidableEq` classes: data on answer types are ordinary hypotheses on `spec.Range t` (see gotcha 12).
2. **`autoImplicit = false` is set globally in `lakefile.lean`**. Do not add `set_option autoImplicit false` in individual files. Every variable must be explicitly declared.
3. **`evalSPMF` IS `simulateQ`** with `IsProbabilitySpec.toPMF`; under `[IsUniformSpec spec]` this is uniform. This is definitional (`rfl`). `evalDist` is its successful-output measure façade on the discrete compatibility path and agrees with the direct `FreeM.denote` measure fold when both specifications are present. These identities are internal to `VCVio/EvalDist/**` and `VCVio/OracleComp/**`: code outside those directories crosses them through the public equation lemmas (`evalSPMF_eq_simulateQ`, `probOutput_def`, `support_def`). Existing downstream `rfl` uses are grandfathered; new proofs use the public equations.
4. **`++ₒ` is dead** — use `+` for combining oracle specs.
5. **Commented-out code is legacy** — follow only uncommented code. Use `Examples/OneTimePad/Basic.lean` as canonical reference.
6. **Preserve partial proofs** with `stop` instead of deleting large proof blocks.
7. **Do not disable linters to silence errors**. Do not use `set_option linter.* false`, `set_option weak.linter.* false`, or add repo-level `leanOptions` that turn lints off to dodge a fixable issue. Fix the root cause instead. (The one deliberate, documented exception is `weak.linter.unicodeLinter, false` in `lakefile.lean`, off so FIPS-204 math notation and diacritics in cited author names are allowed.)
8. **Interop TCB isolation is mandatory**. Core VCVio (`VCVio/`, `ToMathlib/`, `LatticeCrypto/`, `Examples/`, `LatticeCryptoTest/`, `Extern/`, `VCVioWidgets/`, `VCVioTest/`) must never `import Interop.…`, `import Hax.…`, or `import Aeneas.…`. CI fails the PR if it does. See `docs/agents/interop.md`.
9. **Extern link-safety isolation is mandatory**. Proof libraries (`VCVio/`, `ToMathlib/`, `LatticeCrypto/`, `HashSig/`, `Examples/`, `VCVioWidgets/`, `Interop/`) must never `import Extern.…`: the native backends behind it are built as empty stubs whenever the `third_party/` submodules are absent — always the case for Lake dependency checkouts — so importing `Extern` would break downstream executable links. Test libraries may import it. Enforced by `scripts/check-extern-isolation.sh` in CI.

10. **`PMF`/`SPMF` is a retiring surface, not a coequal representation.** New semantic code uses `Measure`/`Kernel` and the measure-backed `Pr{...}[...]` notation. Local `SPMF`, `evalSPMF`, and the legacy scalar evaluation functions are deprecated. Mathlib owns `PMF`, so VCVio cannot attach Lean's `deprecated` attribute to that imported declaration; `ToMathlib.Lint.usesRetiredProbability` detects direct use of it, alongside the local deprecated declarations. The exact `scripts/nolints.json` entries track existing dependent declarations and must shrink as they migrate. Compiler deprecation warnings remain visible in Lean; the build warning budget delegates only these tagged warnings to the environment linter. The old source-count script has been removed. See `docs/reading/denotational-probability-semantics.md`.

11. **Name the reduction in security theorems.** Write `bound ≤ Pr[= true | exp (myReduction adv)]`, never `∃ B, bound ≤ Pr[= true | exp B]`. Adversary types such as `X → ProbComp W` carry no resource bound, and `Classical.choice` can pick a witness directly, so the existential form holds for every scheme and passes the axiom sweep. The same applies to simulators (`∃ sim ζ, HVZK sim ζ` holds with `ζ := 1`), extractors, and distinguishers. If the reduction does not exist yet, use a named `sorry` definition or a warned placeholder instead. See [`docs/agents/crypto.md`](docs/agents/crypto.md#name-the-reduction-in-the-theorem-statement).

12. **No global instance may conclude `C spec.Domain` or `C (spec.Range t)` for a generic `spec`.** `Domain` and `Range` are reducible, so such an instance is indexed as `C ι`, respectively `C (?spec ?t)`, and becomes a candidate for every `C _` goal with `spec` undetermined; search then invents a specification through `ofFn` and either times out or routes ordinary `DecidableEq`/`Fintype`/`Inhabited` instances through oracle data (#772). Write `[DecidableEq ι]` for index equality and `[DecidableEq (spec.Range t)]`, `[Fintype (spec.Range t)]`, `[Inhabited (spec.Range t)]` (quantified over `t` only when a statement ranges over arbitrary queries) for answer types; concrete specifications reduce to their answer types. `VCVioTest/OracleComp/SpecInstanceSearch.lean` guards this.

For the full list, see `docs/agents/gotchas.md`.

## Naming Conventions

Follow Mathlib convention: `{head_symbol}_{operation}_{rhs_form}`.
Examples: `probOutput_bind_eq_tsum`, `support_pure`, `simulateQ_map`.
Structures use UpperCamelCase: `SecurityGame`, `SymmEncAlg`, `RelTriple`.
Security-notion names may begin with an underscore-separated acronym:
`IND_CPA_Advantage`, `SM_DT_UD_Adversary`, `IND_CPA_OneTime_Game`, `OW_CPA_oracleSpec`.
`scripts/lint.py` accepts a `defsWithUnderscore` finding without a `nolints.json` entry when
each underscored name component starts with an acronym of two or more capitals or digits and
every later segment except the last starts with a capital.

## Program Logic Tactics

For new program-logic proofs, import `VCVio.ProgramLogic.Tactics`.
`VCVio.ProgramLogic.Notation` keeps notation plus compatibility macros, but
`Tactics.lean` is the canonical interactive proof mode.

For the tactic reference, proof-mode entry points, and workflow details, see
[`docs/agents/program-logic.md`](docs/agents/program-logic.md). The two
`@[vcspec]` and `@[wpStep]` registries are indexed via
`Lean.Meta.Sym.Pattern` / `Lean.Meta.Sym.DiscrTree`. `Sym.*` is under active
development in core Lean; see the *Internal Architecture* and *SymM
Stability Note* sections of that doc for the churn classes to watch at each
toolchain bump and the re-entry plan for the deferred symbolic
rewriter bridge (when it lands, `Sym.Simp.mkTheoremFromDecl` rebuilds the
bundle on demand).

## Building

```bash
lake exe cache get && lake build
```

`lake build` builds the seven proof libraries (the default targets); `lake build VCVio` is
the fast path for framework-only work. `./scripts/validate.sh` runs the fast per-PR CI checks
locally in CI's order (including the optional `VCVioCslib` facade; build and warning budget, umbrella check, remaining boundary checks, style
linters, agent-docs checks); `--lint` adds Batteries' environment linters, one process per
proof library as in CI. `lake lint` runs both source-style and environment checks;
`-- --style-only` and `-- --env-only` select either pass, and `-- --no-build` requires existing
proof oleans. Findings must exactly match `scripts/nolints.json`: obsolete entries and unlisted
findings fail. After fixing findings, `lake lint -- --prune-baseline` safely removes obsolete
entries across all eight checked libraries and refuses additions. PR CI also checks that the baseline
only shrinks against the merge base.
`--test` adds `lake test` (the three test libraries, the smoke test,
and the SLH-DSA test executables), `--ffi` adds the native ML-KEM / ML-DSA / Falcon
executables to `--test`, and `--axioms` adds the axiom sweep. The eager-initialisation
ratchet runs in the default pass, after the boundary ratchets, since it reads the oleans
the build just produced; `--test` runs it a second time over `VCVioTest` and
`LatticeCryptoTest`, whose oleans `lake test` has just built.

CI runs the timed build on the non-test Lean libraries:
`ToMathlib`, `VCVio`, `VCVioCslib`, `LatticeCrypto`, `Extern`, `HashSig`, `Examples`,
and `VCVioWidgets`. The dormant `Interop` target remains excluded.
The timing report parses per-file build times only for that same set.
Test libraries and test executables are not part of the timed build; CI only
times the smoke module separately with `lake env lean VCVioTest/Smoke.lean`.

After the build, CI runs `./scripts/test-axiomsweep.sh` and then
`lake exe axiomsweep --check`: kernel-level axiom/`sorry` accounting for every
declaration in the non-test libraries, gated against the committed baseline
`scripts/axiom_baseline.json`. It fails on *new* `sorryAx` or non-standard-axiom
taint; after intentionally adding or closing a `sorry`, run
`lake exe axiomsweep --update-baseline` and commit the diff. `Interop` (the
declared TCB) is excluded — its boundary is enforced by the import-isolation
gate instead.

The baseline is an allowlist for `sorryAx` debt only. Native trust
(`native_decide`, which mints per-declaration `._native.` axioms) is held to a
zero-debt rule: anything outside the explicit `grandfatheredNativeTrust` list in
`scripts/AxiomSweep.lean` fails `--check` and cannot be greened by editing the
baseline, since accepting it would widen the trusted computing base. The
`VCVioAxiomSweepTestFixtures` library carries synthetic taint for the tool's own
tests and is deliberately excluded from every aggregate.

`python3 ./scripts/check-comment-fences.py` enforces one rule over every Lean source the
repository tracks or would track — tracked files plus untracked ones that are not ignored, the
vendored `third_party/` tree excluded and both lakefiles included: a block comment that begins
its line must be the last thing on the line where it ends. A declaration written after the `-/`
of the docstring that documents it parses, builds and runs, and a reader scanning the left
margin does not see it. Two passes miss that, for two different reasons, and they are easy to
confuse. `lake lint -- --style-only` runs Mathlib's four text-based linters, none of which has
any notion of a comment. `linter.style.whitespace` is not part of that pass at all: it is a
syntax linter that runs during elaboration under the package's `weak.linter.mathlibStandardSet`,
and its warnings fail CI through the build log and `scripts/check-warning-log.py`. It does
reject a command that does not start at the beginning of a line, and it does report the `/-`
and `/-!` forms of this shape — but it is silent on the `/--` form, because a doc comment is
part of the command it documents, so the command starts at the `/--`, at column 0. So this gate
is the only thing that sees the doc-comment form anywhere; over the seven proof and three test
libraries it deliberately repeats for the other forms what the whitespace linter already says;
and in four further places it is the only check that can *fail* on any form of the shape, for
three different reasons. `lakefile.lean` and `VCVioComplexity/lakefile.lean` are elaborated by
Lake from `import Lake`, with no Mathlib linter registered. `Interop/` is not a default target
and no job builds it. `scripts/` is built on every pull request, but nothing there imports
Mathlib, so the `weak.` option is silently dropped and the linter is never registered — one
Mathlib import in one axiom-sweep fixture would flip that. `VCVioComplexity/` sets
`linter.style.whitespace` explicitly in its own lakefile and the blocking `complexity_backend`
job builds it, so there the linter does run and does warn — what is missing is not the linter
but the gate, since `check-warning-log.py` is invoked only with the proof- and test-library
prefixes and `VCVioComplexity/scripts/test.sh` pipes its log nowhere. A block comment that
opens part-way into a line is untouched however many lines it spans — that is an annotation
inside an expression, a field or a tactic block, and wrapped field docstrings of that shape are
common here. The rule is positional, so it also rejects five shapes that hide nothing: a
comment at column 0 in front of a term, a structure field, a tactic or a list element, each of
which Lean lets begin at column 0 when the enclosing indentation has run out, and a comment at
column 0 whose line ends inside a second, still-open comment. Those five are clean Lean and are
asserted, as rejections, in the fixture matrix. Not covered: a declaration indented on its own
line, which the whitespace linter reports in the built libraries *unless* a margin docstring
precedes it, in which case nothing reports it anywhere; a comment that starts mid-line; two
declarations on one line; and a declaration after the closing quote of a multi-line string,
which is the same hiding with a different delimiter and which `lakefile.lean`, a user of
multi-line strings, could grow. The baseline is zero with no exception list;
`scripts/test-comment-fences.sh` carries the fixtures, including the shapes the rule knowingly
does not reach.

`./scripts/test-initsweep.sh` and `lake exe initsweep --check` are the companion
gate for what the *binary* does rather than what the kernel accepted. A top-level
constant of non-function type is evaluated when its module is loaded, before any
`main` runs, so

```lean
instance : Fintype limitedPrimitives.Y := inferInstanceAs (Fintype (Bytes 16))
```

builds a `Finset` of `2 ^ 128` vectors at start-up in every executable that
imports the module — while elaborating cleanly and passing the build, the
linters, every boundary ratchet and the axiom sweep. `lake exe initsweep --check`
flags a constant when the module initialiser evaluates something for it (its own
value, because the compiled declaration takes no parameters, or an `initialize`
body registered for it) and that value either names one of the enumeration entry
points listed in `scripts/InitSweep.lean` or names a *builder* of an enumeration
class (`Fintype`, `FinEnum`) — an instance constructor or an instance that takes
arguments, as opposed to an already-materialised nullary instance such as
`Bool.fintype`, which costs a pointer copy and is deliberately not counted. The
second disjunct is what makes the check a class test: writing the instance the
elaborator would have found (`:= Pi.instFintype`) names none of the entry points
and builds the same enumeration. The same sweep also walks the compiler-generated
declarations the module initialiser assigns beside its constants, because a
parameterless *specialisation* lifted out of a function is initialised at load and
has no environment constant to read; those are tested by what the functions in
their mangled name consume.

Marking the instance `noncomputable` is *not* a fix: it removes the instance's
own compiled code and leaves the compiled auxiliary that carries the enumeration,
which is the constant the gate names. Adding a parameter is not reliably a fix
either — `def cardY (_u : Unit) : Nat := Fintype.card T` still enumerates `T` at
load, through the specialisation the compiler lifts out of it. Route the
finiteness argument through `Fintype.ofFinite` instead, whose `Prop`-valued
`Finite` argument leaves nothing compiled at all.

The baseline `scripts/init_sweep_baseline.json` is a list of accepted constant
names — the allowlist idea `scripts/axiom_baseline.json` uses, with a scope
attached — rather than a per-library ceiling: accepting one benign instance costs
exactly that name and leaves every other constant of its library at zero. It
holds nine rows today; `scripts/InitSweep.lean` lists what each one does at load,
read off the emitted C, including the two that turn out not to be initialised at
all. A row is scoped to one constant under one library, so the same name flagged
under another root, or gaining a new entry point, is still a regression. Adding a
row is the escape hatch and needs an argument in review;
`lake exe initsweep --update-baseline` writes it and preserves the rows of
libraries the run did not sweep. `VCVioInitSweepTestFixtures` carries seven
hazard modules, one per route by which loading a module can build an enumeration,
one negative control per clause of the predicate, and the baseline's accept /
drop / narrow / widen / re-scope / preserve behaviour; like the axiom-sweep
fixtures it is kept out of every aggregate.

The gate cannot see how *large* an enumeration is, and it does not look at values
whose size is an argument rather than a type (`List.range n`,
`Array.replicate n x`); `scripts/InitSweep.lean` lists what that leaves open,
with the occurrences of each in the current tree.

After adding new `.lean` files: `./scripts/update-lib.sh` (CI's `scripts/check-imports.sh`
fails when a regenerated umbrella would differ from the committed one).

Lean toolchain and Mathlib must stay in sync (both currently `v4.34.0`); the bump procedure
is in `CONTRIBUTING.md`. Mathlib's file-length linter is enabled at 1500 lines. Split
files by responsibility before crossing that limit; retain an import façade when an existing
module path forms part of the public API.
