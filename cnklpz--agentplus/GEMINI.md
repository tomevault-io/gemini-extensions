# AgentPlus contributor guide

Tauri 2 (Rust, `src-tauri/`) + React 18 + TypeScript (`src/`).

Checks: frontend `npm run check` (`tsc --noEmit` + `vitest run`); backend, from `src-tauri/`,
`cargo clippy --all-targets` (keep it at zero warnings) and `cargo test`. When you change
logic, add unit tests for the edge cases.

Code, comments, docs and commit messages are written in English.

## Adapting to a new agent release

When a new release of an agent (Codex, Claude Code…) needs a change, **keep the handling for
older releases** and pick one by version number. Releases before the change keep the old
handling; releases from it on use the new one, until the next change. Never rewrite or
delete what an older release still relies on.

- Codex UI patches (`src-tauri/src/cdp.rs`): add a shape for the new release to the patch's
  `by_version` list, tagged with the first release it is for (`[26, 928]` for 26.928.x), and
  keep the older shapes. `by_version` takes the newest shape not newer than the running
  release; only an unknown version tries every shape, oldest first.
- Keep the older releases' tests, add one with a snippet from the new release, and check the
  real bundles: extract `app.asar`, then `CODEX_ASSETS=<dir>\webview\assets
  CODEX_VERSION=<version> cargo test real_bundles -- --ignored`.

## Commit messages

Every commit subject uses exactly:

```text
type(scope): description
```

Both `type` and `scope` are required lower-case ASCII kebab-case.

- `type` is one of `feat`, `fix`, `perf`, `refactor`, `test`, `docs`, `build`, `ci`,
  `chore`, `revert`.
- `scope` names the part of the project the change is in, e.g. `codex`, `claude-code`,
  `gateway`, `sessions`, `updater`, `macos`, `i18n`, `release`, `readme`, `agents-md`.
  Use `repo` for changes that span the whole repository.
- `description` is in the imperative mood (`add`, `fix`, `drop`; not `added` / `fixes`),
  starts lower-case, has no trailing period, and keeps the whole subject within 72 characters.
- The body is optional; skip it when the subject says it all. Otherwise explain why the
  change was needed and its impact rather than restating the diff, one bullet per
  user-visible change when there are several, wrapped at about 72 characters.
- One change per commit; split unrelated changes.
- Reference issues in the body: `Fixes #12` / `Refs #12`.
- No `Co-Authored-By` or any other AI attribution.
- Releases: `npm version x.y.z` commits as `chore(release): x.y.z` (set in `.npmrc`); the
  changelog commit before it is `docs(changelog): add x.y.z notes`.
- Never rewrite history that has been pushed.

## Internationalization (i18n)

The UI supports English and Simplified Chinese. **English is the source language**; the
Chinese text must match it entry for entry. **No user-visible text may be hard-coded**, on
the frontend or the backend: whenever you add or change text, write both the English and
the Chinese at the same time.

### Frontend (`src/i18n/`)

- Dictionaries: `src/i18n/en/<ns>.ts` is the source; `src/i18n/zh/<ns>.ts` is typed with
  `const zh: typeof en`, so a missing or extra key fails to compile. One namespace per source
  file (the header comment names it), e.g. `components/GatewayPage.tsx` → `gatewayPage`.
  Words shared by several files go in `common`; everything else stays in its own namespace.
- Adding a source file: create a namespace file of the same name in both `en/` and `zh/`,
  and register it in both `index.ts` files.
- Usage (`import { t, tn, tx } from "../i18n"`):
  - `t("gatewayPage.title")`; placeholders `t("app.saved", { name })`, with
    `"Saved \"{name}\""` in the dictionary.
  - Counts use `tn("x.models", n)`: English is `"{n} model|{n} models"` (singular|plural),
    Chinese has a single form.
  - When a placeholder has to be a React element, use `tx("x.hint", { link: <a …/> })`
    instead of splitting one sentence into several keys.
  - Keys are camelCase and named for their meaning (`deleteConfirm`, not `text1`). Keep a
    sentence as one key; never assemble one from word keys, since word order differs
    between languages.
- Switching language re-renders `App` and refetches backend data. So:
  - **Never call `t()` at module top level** (`const TABS = [{ label: t(...) }]` is evaluated
    once). Store keys (type `TKey`) in top-level constants, or make them functions, and call
    `t()` while rendering.
  - A `useMemo` that produces translated text lists the return value of `useLang()` in its deps.
  - A component that fetches backend data on mount and keeps it in state (backend text
    changes with the language too) lists `lang` in the effect's deps.
- Format dates and numbers with `toLocaleString(locale())`; never hard-code a locale.
- Not translated: agent / product names (Codex, Claude Code, OpenCode…), config keys, file
  paths, protocol names, command lines.
- English style: concise sentence case; buttons are verbs (Save, Add provider). Chinese
  text uses full-width punctuation and 「」 quotes where English uses "…".
- The language preference is `prefs.lang` (`auto | en | zh`; `auto` follows the system),
  switched under Settings → Interface.

### Backend (`src-tauri/src/i18n.rs`)

Text generated by the backend (`Kv` labels, notes, diff lines, error messages, settings
labels and descriptions, …) is bilingual too, English first:

- Without placeholders: `l("Base URL", "地址")` → `&'static str`.
- With placeholders: `tr!("Provider not found: {id}", "找不到供应商 {id}")` → `String`,
  following `format!` rules (write literal braces as `{{` `}}`). Errors:
  `anyhow!(tr!(…))` / `bail!("{}", tr!(…))`.
- Counts: `trn!(n, "{n} model", "{n} models", "{n} 个模型")`.
- Static tables (`const` arrays, `Spec`, …) can't call `l()`: store `(en, zh)` pairs and call
  `l(en, zh)` where they are used.
- The frontend syncs the language with the `set_locale` command; every call in `api.ts`
  waits for it.
- **The frontend must never branch on text returned by the backend** (e.g.
  `group === "Input"`), since it changes with the language. Have the backend
  add a stable field instead (like `ModelField.gid` or `BackupEntry.blockedMissing`).
- Not translated: content written into users' config files (config keys, comments,
  provider ids), developer-facing debug logs, request content sent to upstream APIs.
- Tests default to Chinese (the backend's language until `set_locale` runs); keep the
  Chinese strings existing tests assert on unchanged.
