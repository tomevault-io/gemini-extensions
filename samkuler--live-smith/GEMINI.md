# Live Smith Contributor Guide

This file defines durable collaboration rules. It is not a product manual,
implementation plan, or record of individual changes.

## Documentation responsibilities

- `README.md` introduces the product, user workflow, limits, and privacy.
- `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` owns setup, build, verification, packaging, and local
  development data instructions.
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` owns module responsibilities, lifecycle, and safety
  invariants; `docs/MODEL_PROVIDERS.md` owns model and connection contracts.
- Keep documentation about the implemented product and lasting constraints.
  Do not add task narratives, review outcomes, commit references, temporary
  checklists, or conversation context. Keep migration compatibility details
  where they describe supported data formats.
- Never commit superpowers workflow documents or temporary execution plans.
  Keep execution notes outside repository documentation.

## Project map

- `src/app/` owns application orchestration. Its `chat/`, `audio/`, `plugins/`,
  `model/`, `context/`, and `session/` directories own the corresponding
  workflows; request and dialog coordinators remain at the application root.
  Provider-specific application workflows stay in their provider directory,
  such as `src/app/audio/suno/`; shared audio workflows consume Plugin methods
  and adapter capabilities. Bind private credentials and host facilities in
  `src/app/plugins/built-in-plugin-runtime.ts`.
- `src/audio-services/` owns shared audio contracts and provider directories
  for protocol implementations. Suno website, Suno Platform, and SunoAPI remain
  separate provider boundaries.
- `src/agent/` contains the provider-neutral bounded tool loop and strict Live
  action schemas.
- `src/live/` observes Ableton state, resolves targets, and executes validated
  actions.
- `src/model/` contains Profiles, capability resolution, transport selection,
  and provider protocol adapters.
- `src/runtime/` owns explicit extension-host capability boundaries for Fetch
  and cancellation APIs.
- `src/attachments/` validates and extracts supported attachment formats;
  `src/skills/` owns Skill format rules and bundled definitions.
- `src/storage/` persists Profiles, sessions, session events, and raw model
  discovery metadata, and owns private attachment and User Skill storage.
- `src/ui/` contains state serialization and dialogs for the chat interface.
- Typed browser validators live in `src/ui/client/wire-contracts/`. Connection
  state and editing have dedicated browser modules; keep their state ownership
  out of the transport bridge and derive form views from the canonical snapshot.
- `tests/` mirrors source module ownership and contains behavior tests,
  module-local `support/` helpers, and attachment fixtures. Real chat DOM
  behavior tests live under interaction domains in `tests/ui/`; coordinator
  and bridge suites use subject directories under `tests/app/`.
  Provider protocol tests live under `tests/audio-services/`. Plugin examples
  and compatibility packages remain under `test-fixtures/plugins/`.

See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` and `docs/MODEL_PROVIDERS.md` before changing a
cross-module contract.

## Provider contracts

There are two API families and three supported modes:

- OpenAI Responses
- OpenAI Chat Completions
- Anthropic Messages

A named Profile owns one complete connection plus one or more model
configurations. Each model configuration owns its generation parameters,
capability overrides, hosted-tool policy, and Extra Body. A `direct-api`
connection owns family, mode, base URL, and API key. An `oauth-subscription`
connection owns only an OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google provider identity; its
credential, backend, auth generation, and signed-in catalog are isolated to the
exact Profile ID and provider. Credentials remain in private OAuth storage.
Google subscription OAuth uses Antigravity browser PKCE with the registered
hosted callback; the user pastes its one-time authorization code into the exact
pending Profile. Its catalog and generation requests use the Antigravity
product protocol without bundling or requiring the Antigravity runtime.
Do not add endpoint or vendor presets. OpenAI-compatible services use an
ordinary Direct API OpenAI Profile with the protocol they implement.

Keep Direct API provider-specific request mapping, streaming, tool-call replay,
and opaque response state inside `src/model/transports/`; keep OAuth login,
refresh, product-protocol, and lifecycle mapping inside `src/model/oauth/`. The
agent loop and Live executor must remain provider-neutral. Resolve feature
decisions from capabilities, not from model-name checks inside either boundary.

Preserve supported, unsupported, and unverified capability evidence. Direct API
discovery metadata belongs to its exact Profile connection; OAuth catalogs stay
modal-only and scoped to the selected Profile/provider connection and its
current auth generation. Configuration, discovery evidence, and Session model
selection have separate owners.

## Safety invariants

- Observe the relevant Live state before mutating it.
- Execute only actions accepted by the descriptors in
  `src/agent/action-schema.ts` and the plan validator in `src/agent/actions.ts`.
- Session Edit Scope is a hard write boundary independent of approval. Check
  the complete plan against real bound targets before confirmation, recheck in
  the mutation queue, and check subsequent actions against the latest saved
  scopes. Container operations include affected content, device, and mixer
  scopes. Missing historical metadata means All; an empty list means read-only.
- Apply approval is an explicit three-mode policy: Manual asks for every plan,
  Low Risk asks for protected actions, and Accept Everything automatically
  approves every authorized, validated plan, including deletes and replacement
  writes within the selected Edit Scope.
  Every mode still requires observation, schema validation, preflight, the
  process-wide mutation queue, cancellation, and state-drift revalidation.
- Send requests contain only `prompt` and `sessionId`. Session commands contain
  only their command-specific fields. Neither path may carry Profile settings
  or credentials.
- A Session model selection stores only Profile ID, model ID, and an optional
  reasoning-effort override. Resolve and validate the complete runtime model
  from the active saved Profile at send admission.
- OpenAI Responses uses local state and `store: false`.
- Import Node runtime values such as `URL`, `Buffer`, and process data from
  their `node:` modules. Resolve host-provided Fetch and Abort APIs only through
  `src/runtime/host.ts`; do not use ambient runtime globals elsewhere.
- The extension bundle must not depend on `structuredClone`; clone
  provider/profile JSON through `cloneJsonValue`. The build enforces these host
  compatibility boundaries and smoke-loads the bundle without ambient Web APIs.
- Provider errors must include useful family/mode context without exposing API
  keys, authorization headers, raw credential-bearing causes, or request bodies.

## Local-only files

Do not publish the Ableton Extensions SDK, its archives, examples,
documentation, API reference, or license copy. Contributors obtain the SDK from
Ableton and keep it under `extensions-sdk-1/`; only that directory's README is
public.

Do not delete or publish `.env.local`, `.claude/`, `node_modules/`, `dist/`, or
other local SDK files unless the owner explicitly requests it. Provider keys
belong only in locally saved Profiles and must never enter source, fixtures,
logs, screenshots, or documentation.

## Editing rules

- Preserve unrelated user changes and avoid destructive Git operations.
- Diagnose the root cause and reproduce behavior before changing it. Fix the
  responsible layer without model-specific exceptions, speculative abstractions,
  redundant state, or checks that no caller consumes.
- Keep the three transport modes explicit; do not reintroduce flattened legacy
  settings or implicit environment-variable provider configuration.
- Add request-capture and replay tests when transport mapping changes.
- Drive the real `chat-dialog.html` script through DOM events for UI behavior
  changes instead of relying only on source-pattern assertions.
- Test observable state, protocol, or DOM behavior instead of checking isolated
  prompt phrases or static CSS values. Keep generated-instruction assembly in
  one canonical contract test rather than repeating copy assertions across
  layers.
- JSDOM tests cover event and DOM semantics, not rendered geometry. Do not use
  computed-style assertions as proof of visual layout in the Ableton host.
- Organize tests under `tests/` by behavior domain; keep reusable harnesses
  separate from test cases. Keep fixtures only while active tests or runnable
  examples consume them; remove obsolete scaffolding and unused exports.
  Do not use static DOM nesting, decorative CSS classes, icon counts or
  copies of static prose as substitutes for behavior assertions.
- Keep provider rules canonical across tool schemas, parsing and protocol
  validation. Plugin-owned text invocations use the host's admission and
  authorization boundaries; they do not own Session jobs or Live mutation.
- Keep configuration writes limited to Profile CRUD/activation, explicit
  Session metadata commands, and the dedicated global-settings command.
- Update the document that owns a changed user workflow or contract; link to it
  from other documents instead of copying detailed implementation explanations.

## Verification

Run before handing off a change:

```sh
npm run verify
```

This runs the complete test suite, production build, composed-dialog client
syntax check, and dependency audit. Report what was actually checked; automated
tests do not establish visual or live-provider behavior in the Ableton host.
