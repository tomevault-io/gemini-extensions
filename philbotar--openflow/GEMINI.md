# AGENTS.md

Single-file orientation for contributors and coding agents.

## Crate orientation (AGENTS.md)

| Crate | File |
| --- | --- |
| engine | [`crates/engine/AGENTS.md`](crates/engine/AGENTS.md) |
| providers | [`crates/providers/AGENTS.md`](crates/providers/AGENTS.md) |
| orchestration | [`crates/orchestration/AGENTS.md`](crates/orchestration/AGENTS.md) |
| desktop | [`crates/desktop/AGENTS.md`](crates/desktop/AGENTS.md) |
| ui | [`crates/ui/AGENTS.md`](crates/ui/AGENTS.md) |

Each file covers architecture, dependency rules, code standards, patterns, and change checklists for that crate.

## 30-Second Intake

1. This is a Rust workspace with five crates: `engine`, `providers`, `orchestration`, `desktop`, `ui`.
2. Core rule: keep engine logic in `engine`; keep API transport/auth quirks in `providers`; keep runtime/state/storage in `orchestration`; keep Tauri adapter code in `desktop`; keep frontend code in `ui`.
   - **engine** — valid workflow + run behavior
   - **orchestration** — store, load, wire, host runs
   - **providers** — LLM transport
   - **ui** / **desktop** — user interaction
3. Start docs at `docs/README.md` — see [Documentation](#documentation) for the full tree.
4. Development lanes: `docs/contributing/development-lanes.md`.
5. Coding patterns: `docs/contributing/coding-patterns.md`.
6. Workflow verification: `docs/contributing/testing-workflows.md`.
7. Engine vocabulary: `docs/glossary.md`.

## Boundary Seams

Add a port/trait only when a consumer is typed on that interface. Otherwise call the concrete type directly.

| Seam | Location |
| --- | --- |
| LLM invocation (`AiPort`, `AgentRequest`) | `crates/engine/src/ports/outbound.rs` |
| Tool and subagent execution (`ToolPort`) | `crates/engine/src/ports/outbound.rs` → `crates/orchestration/src/run/execution/tool_port.rs` |
| Human input / tool approval | `crates/engine/src/ports/inbound.rs` |
| Provider client (`AiClient: AiPort`) | `crates/providers/src/client.rs` |
| UI → desktop IPC | `crates/ui/src/port.ts` (`UiDesktopOutboundPort`) |

## Development Lanes

Before editing, classify the change with [`docs/contributing/development-lanes.md`](docs/contributing/development-lanes.md). Agent skills and editor rules should route to that doc instead of carrying their own copy of architecture facts.

## Dev Entry Points

- Full desktop app: `./scripts/start.sh`
- Frontend only: `npm --prefix crates/ui run dev`
- Frontend typecheck: `npm --prefix crates/ui run typecheck`

## Runtime/Persistence Locations

| Data | Path |
| --- | --- |
| App workflows | `{data_local}/openflow/workflows.json` |
| Settings | `{data_local}/openflow/settings.json` |
| Projects | `{data_local}/openflow/projects.json` (migrates from legacy slug) |
| Saved agents | `{data_local}/openflow/agents.json` (migrates from legacy slug) |
| Node templates | `{data_local}/openflow/templates.json` (migrates from legacy slug) |
| Project workflows | `{project}/.flow/workflows/{workflowId}.workflow.json` |
| Provider API keys | Plaintext in `settings.json` (`ProviderProfile.api_key`) |

`AppBackend::load_all_workflows` merges app-store and project-discovered workflows (project files win on ID collision).

API key resolution order (highest to lowest): transient input panel → stored settings key (`ProviderProfile.api_key`) → provider env var fallback (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, etc.).

## Verification Commands

Primary gate — run after changes:

```bash
./scripts/verify.sh
```

Runs all steps (`fmt`, clippy-max `clippy`, `doc`, `test`, `public-api`, `machete`, `typos`, `ui-typecheck`, `ui-test`, `deny`, `arch`); prints one-line PASS/FAIL per step and a summary with repro commands. Optional `./scripts/verify.sh --deep` adds `mutants` and `miri` (engine + orchestration UB via `./scripts/miri.sh`). Filter steps: `./scripts/verify.sh fmt clippy`. `VERIFY_FAIL_FAST=1` stops on first failure.

For single-step debug with full untruncated output, run a granular script directly: `./scripts/verify/<step>.sh` (see `scripts/verify/`).

For execution changes, also run:

```bash
cargo test -p orchestration --test workflow_acceptance -- --nocapture
```

See `docs/contributing/testing-workflows.md` for layered test commands.

## Cursor Cloud specific instructions

OpenFlow is a **Tauri desktop GUI app**. Standard commands are in the README and `scripts/start.sh`; lint/test/build use `./scripts/verify.sh` (see [Verification Commands](#verification-commands)). Notes below are only the non-obvious caveats for this VM.

- **Run the GUI:** export `DISPLAY=:1` (a headless X server runs there) before `./scripts/start.sh`. The Tauri dev command also auto-starts the Vite dev server on `http://localhost:1420`.
- **Benign noise:** `libEGL warning: DRI3 error ...` lines at launch are expected — the VM has no GPU, so it falls back to software rendering. Not an error.
- **No API key = editor only:** without an LLM key the header shows "API key missing" and the **Run** button cannot execute a workflow, but the visual editor (create workflow, add/rename/configure nodes, save) works fully. For real runs, set `OPENAI_API_KEY` / `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (env fallback) or a key in Settings; resolution order is in [Runtime/Persistence Locations](#runtimepersistence-locations).
- **First Rust build is slow** (large AWS SDK + reqwest tree, ~25 min cold). Subsequent builds are incremental. `cargo`-based `verify.sh` steps reuse `./target` only with `VERIFY_SHARE_TARGET=1` (faster solo runs); otherwise each run gets its own `target/verify-<pid>`.
- **Verify-gate tooling** (`cargo-deny`, `cargo-machete`, `typos`) and Tauri Linux system libs (`libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev`, `libxdo-dev`, `libayatana-appindicator3-dev`, `librsvg2-dev`, ...) are preinstalled in the VM snapshot. If a `verify.sh` step reports one missing, reinstall it (cargo tool via `cargo install`, system lib via `apt-get`).
