# Pipelines

When making or editing pipelines for releases and builds, ensure that:

- The pipeline is designed to be cross-platform, supporting Windows, Linux, and macOS.
- The pipeline includes steps for building, testing, and packaging the software.
- The pipeline is automated to run on every commit or pull request to ensure continuous integration.
- The pipeline includes steps for generating release notes and updating the changelog.
- The pipeline is documented with clear instructions on how to run it locally and in the CI environment.
- The pipeline is version-controlled and follows best practices for maintainability and scalability.
- The pipeline includes security checks and vulnerability scans to ensure the software is secure.
- The pipeline is commented for clarity, explaining each step and its purpose.
- The scripts in the scripts direectory must be well commented and follow the same language guidelines as the rest of the codebase.
- The pipeline should include steps for linting the code to ensure code quality and adherence to coding standards.

# Changelog

When updating the changelog, follow these guidelines:

- Use the format `## [version] - YYYY-MM-DD` for each version entry.
- Include sections for `Added`, `Changed`, `Deprecated`, `Removed`, `Fixed`, and `Security`.
- Each section should list the changes made in that version, with a brief description of each change.
- Ensure that the changelog is updated with every release, reflecting all changes made since the last version.
- Use bullet points for clarity and readability.
- Ensure that the changelog is written in English, with clear and concise descriptions of changes.
- Avoid using jargon or abbreviations that may not be understood by all users.
- Keep the changelog up-to-date with every commit that affects the software, not just major releases.
- Ensure that the changelog is accessible in the repository, typically in a file named `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Use consistent formatting and style throughout the changelog to maintain readability.
- Ensure that the changelog is linked in the README or documentation for easy access by users.
- Use semantic versioning for version numbers, following the format `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.

# Release Notes

When creating release notes, ensure that:

- The release notes are clear, concise, and informative.
- Each release note includes a summary of the changes made in that version.
- The release notes are written in English and are accessible to all users.
- The release notes are linked in the changelog and README for easy access.
- The release notes include any important information about breaking changes, new features, or bug fixes.
- The release notes are formatted consistently with the changelog for easy navigation.
- The release notes are versioned and follow the same versioning scheme as the changelog.
- The release notes include links to relevant issues or pull requests for further context.
- The release notes are stored in a file named `RELEASE_NOTES.md` or similar, in the root of the repository.
- The release notes are updated with every release, reflecting all changes made since the last version.

# Versioning

When versioning the software, follow these guidelines:

- Use semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) to indicate the nature of changes:
  - **MAJOR**: Incompatible API changes
  - **MINOR**: Backward-compatible functionality
  - **PATCH**: Backward-compatible bug fixes
- Ensure that the version number is updated in the codebase, documentation, and changelog with every release.
- Use a consistent versioning scheme across all components of the software.
- Ensure that the version number is clearly displayed in the software, such as in the help command or about section.
- Use tags in the version control system (e.g., Git) to mark each release with the corresponding version number.
- The tags should follow the format `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` for clarity.
- Ensure that the version number is included in the release notes and changelog for easy reference.

# Zig specific guidelines

When writing Zig code, follow these additional guidelines:

- Use `const` and `var` appropriately to define variables, with `const` for immutable values and `var` for mutable ones.
- Use `comptime` for compile-time evaluation where applicable, to improve performance and reduce runtime overhead.
- Use `error` for error handling, and ensure that errors are handled gracefully.
- Use `defer` for cleanup operations, ensuring that resources are released properly.
- All Zig code must be formatted using `zig fmt` to ensure consistent style and readability.
  - This should be integrated into the CI pipeline to automatically format code on every commit or pull request.
- Prefer stdout and stderr for output, using `std.io.getStdOut().print()` and `std.io.getStdErr().print()` for printing messages.
- Zig Documentation Comments
  Use standard Zig documentation comments: `//!` for file/module-level comments and `///` for public items like functions, structs, enums, etc.
  The goal is to generate useful documentation and keep the code self-explanatory.
  These comments are parsed by the Zig compiler and can be accessed via `std.meta.declDocs` and `std.meta.modDocs`.
- Zig Error Handling
  Strictly adhere to Zig's error handling model, using error sets and `try` for propagation.
  Avoid `unreachable` or `panic` unless for unrecoverable logical errors or critical invariant assertions.
- Zig Naming Conventions
  Follow commonly accepted Zig community naming conventions:
  - `PascalCase` for types (structs, enums, unions).
  - `camelCase` for functions and methods.
  - `snake_case` for variables, struct/union members, and source file names (`.zig`).

# Testing

When writing tests, ensure that:

- Tests are written in a clear and concise manner, with descriptive names for test functions.
- Tests cover a wide range of scenarios, including edge cases and error conditions.
- Use the `std.testing` module for writing tests, ensuring that tests are run using `zig test`.
- Ensure that tests are automated and run as part of the CI pipeline to catch issues early.
- Use assertions to verify expected behavior, and ensure that tests fail when the expected conditions are not met.
- Ensure that tests are isolated and do not depend on external state or resources.
- Ensure that tests don't write to stdout or debug output, as this can interfere with test results.
- Ensure that tests don't write to disk or modify the filesystem, as this can lead to flaky tests.
- Test Naming and Scope (especially for `src/tests.zig`)
  Tests, particularly those in `src/tests.zig`, must be descriptively named (e.g., `test "descriptive test name" { ... }`).
  Each test should ideally verify a single logical unit or functionality.
  Include tests for edge cases, invalid inputs, and success scenarios.
  Ensure all tests are executable via `zig build test`.

# Build System (`build.zig`)

## applyTo: 'build.zig'

- The `build.zig` file is central to the compilation process. It must be kept clean, well-commented, and organized.
- Any complex build logic, option definitions (e.g., `-Doptimize`, `-Dtarget`), custom test steps, or dependency management must be clearly documented within it.

# Automation Scripts

## applyTo: 'scripts/\*\*'

- Scripts in the `scripts/` directory (e.g., `build-all.sh`, `create-release.ps1`) must be well-commented, explaining their purpose, any parameters they accept, and any external dependencies.
- If multiple versions exist for different operating systems (e.g., `.sh` and `.ps1`), ensure they maintain functional parity or clearly document the differences.
- All comments and output within scripts must be in English.

# Version Control

- Commit Messages
  Adopt the Conventional Commits standard for commit messages (e.g., `feat: add new feature`, `fix: correct bug X`, `docs: update Y documentation`, `style: code formatting`, `refactor: Z refactoring`, `test: add tests for W`, `chore: update build script`).
  This facilitates automatic changelog generation and improves the readability of the change history.

# Project Documentation

## applyTo: 'README.md'

- The main `README.md` file must always be kept up-to-date and considered the primary entry point for understanding the project.
- It must include:
  - A clear description of the '100-numbers' project.
  - Detailed instructions for building (`zig build`) and running on different platforms.
  - How to run tests (`zig build test`).
  - Direct links to `CHANGELOG.md` and `RELEASE_NOTES.md`.
  - Any specific system dependencies or requirements.
- All content must be in English.

# Dependency Management

- If the project starts using external dependencies managed via Zig's package manager (e.g., through a `build.zig.zon` file):
  - Ensure this file is always committed.
  - Ensure dependency versions are pinned to guarantee reproducible and stable builds.

# Performance Guidelines

When optimizing code, follow these principles:

- Profile before optimizing - use `zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseFast` for performance testing
- Prefer algorithmic improvements over micro-optimizations
- Use `comptime` for compile-time calculations to reduce runtime overhead
- Minimize memory allocations in hot paths
- Document performance-critical sections with comments explaining why specific approaches were chosen
- Include performance benchmarks in commit messages when making optimization changes
- Always test both debug and release builds before commits
- Use `-Doptimize=ReleaseFast` for production builds
- Include cross-compilation testing in CI for all target platforms
- Ensure builds are reproducible - avoid system-dependent paths or timestamps

# Memory Management

When working with memory in Zig:

- Use arena allocators for temporary allocations that can be freed together
- Always pair allocator.alloc() with allocator.free()
- Use `defer` for automatic cleanup in error paths
- Prefer stack allocation over heap when data size is known and reasonable
- Document memory ownership in function signatures
- Avoid memory leaks by ensuring all allocated memory is properly freed

# Multithreading Guidelines

For concurrent code:

- Use Zig's thread-safe primitives (`std.Thread.Mutex`, `std.atomic`)
- Avoid shared mutable state when possible - prefer message passing
- Document thread safety guarantees in function comments
- Use `std.Thread.Pool` for work distribution patterns
- Always handle thread creation/joining errors gracefully
- Test multithreaded code with different thread counts and under high load
- Ensure proper synchronization to avoid race conditions

# Error Handling Specifics

For robust error handling:

- Define custom error sets for different subsystems (e.g., `GridError`, `WorkerError`)
- Always handle or explicitly propagate errors - never ignore them
- Use descriptive error names that indicate the failure cause
- Log errors with sufficient context for debugging
- Prefer returning errors over printing and continuing
- Include relevant context in error messages (thread ID, operation state)

# Logging and Debugging

When adding logging and debug information:

- Use structured logging with consistent format
- Include relevant context in log messages (thread ID, operation state)
- Use different log levels appropriately (debug, info, warn, error)
- Never log sensitive information
- Ensure logging doesn't significantly impact performance in release builds
- Use `std.log` for consistent logging across the application
