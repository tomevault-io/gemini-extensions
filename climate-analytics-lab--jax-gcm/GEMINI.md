## Think Before Coding
This is a complex codebase with many interdependencies and intricate scientific formulations. Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.

Before implementing:

 - State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
 - If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
 - If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
 - If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

Always document these decisions in the comments, and if appropriate in the documentation (and possibly in the high-level design documentation)

Comments should always reference the current state of the code, and explain *why* it is doing what it is doing, not how it is different to some previous version of the code (Which can get out of date and confusing)

## Project Overview

JAX-GCM (`jcm`) is a fully differentiable General Circulation Model (GCM) for atmospheric simulation, written entirely in JAX. It combines the Dinosaur spectral dynamical core with JAX implementations of ICON /ECHAM and SPEEDY atmospheric physics parameterizations. The model supports gradient-based optimization, data assimilation, and hybrid physics-ML workflows.

- **Package name:** `jcm`
- **Python:** >= 3.11 (strict requirement)
- **License:** Apache 2.0
- **Status:** Alpha (v1.0.0)

Note, the latest development work should target the `dev` branch. Clean, working releases are periodically merged into `main` and tagged.

## Build & Install

```bash
pip install -e .
```

Dependencies are in `requirements.txt`: dinosaur, flax, jax-datetime, tree-math, hydra-core, xarray.

## Running Tests

```bash
# Default — run in parallel across ~12 workers (pytest-xdist).
# Cuts a full sweep from ~15 min to a couple of minutes locally.
JAX_PLATFORMS=cpu pytest -n 12

# Single-process if you need ordered output or are debugging a flake
pytest

# Fast tests only (skip slow integration tests >1 min)
JAX_PLATFORMS=cpu pytest -n 12 -m "not slow"

# Specific test file
pytest jcm/model_test.py

# With coverage (xdist works with --cov)
JAX_PLATFORMS=cpu pytest -n 12 --cov=jcm --cov-fail-under=90
```

`-n auto` will pick the number of workers from the visible CPU count;
`-n 12` is the recommended local default on the dev workstation. Use
`-n 0` (or just omit `-n`) to fall back to a single process when you
need deterministic ordering.

**``JAX_PLATFORMS=cpu`` is required for parallel runs on GPU hosts.**
Without it, every xdist worker tries to grab the same GPU and you
get ``CUDA_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY`` / ``dnn_support != nullptr``
``RET_CHECK`` failures from XLA. The unit tests don't need a GPU —
they're small column-mode integrations that compile and run faster
on CPU than they would round-trip through the device anyway.

Test files use the `*_test.py` naming convention and are co-located with their source modules. Tests use `unittest.TestCase` classes run via pytest. The `conftest.py` at root cleans `jcm` module imports between tests to prevent state leakage.

**CI thresholds:**
- Push: fast tests only, 90% coverage required
- Pull request: includes slow tests, 80% coverage required

## Linting

```bash
ruff check .
```

Ruff is the only linter. Configuration is in `pyproject.toml`. Docstring checks (D rules) are enabled but most missing-docstring rules are suppressed. No formatter (Black), no type checker (mypy), no pre-commit hooks.

## Key Coding Conventions

### Functional programming with JAX
- All functions must be **pure** (no side effects) to work with JAX transformations (`jit`, `grad`, `vmap`)
- Use **immutable data structures** via `@tree_math.struct` decorator
- No Python `if/else` on JAX-traced values — use `jax.lax.cond()` or `jnp.where()` instead
- Array shapes must be **statically known** where possible
- See `JAX_gotchas.md` for common pitfalls

### Data structures
```python
@tree_math.struct
class PhysicsState:
    u_wind: jnp.ndarray
    v_wind: jnp.ndarray
    temperature: jnp.ndarray
    ...
```

### Import conventions
```python
import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp
from jax import jit, vmap, lax
import numpy as np
import xarray as xr
import tree_math
from dinosaur import primitive_equations
```

### Naming
- **snake_case** for functions and variables
- **PascalCase** for classes
- Descriptive names for physics variables: `u_wind`, `specific_humidity`, `surface_pressure`
- Abbreviated names acceptable in performance-critical inner functions

### Function patterns
- `get_*` — computation functions (e.g., `get_convection_tendencies`)
- `diagnose_*` — diagnostic calculations
- `compute_*` — derived quantity computation
- `set_*` — parameter/state modification

### Type hints and docstrings
- Type hints in function signatures (not strictly enforced)
- NumPy-style docstrings for public functions

### Testing
- Test files: `module_name_test.py` in the same directory as the module
- Mark slow tests (>1 min) with `@pytest.mark.slow`
- Include gradient checks (`check_vjp`, `check_jvp`) for JAX functions
- PRs should include tests for new functionality and bug fixes

## Documentation

Built with Sphinx + Furo theme:

```bash
cd docs && make html
```

Auto-generated physics variable translation docs come from `jcm/physics/speedy/units_table.csv` via `docs/generate_docs.py`.

## Architecture Notes

- **Dynamics** are handled by the external `dinosaur` package (spectral dynamical core)
- **Physics** parameterizations are modular — SPEEDY and ICON ports are the main implementations, Held-Suarez is a simpler alternative
- **Composable physics is the only physics API.** `PhysicsTerm` (flax.nnx.Module) base class wraps each parameterization. `ComposablePhysics` (and `ComposableIconPhysics`) aggregates terms with `replace()`, `remove()`, and `__add__()` operators. Build pre-configured packages via the `speedy_physics()` and `icon_physics()` factories.
- **physics_interface.py** bridges dynamics (spectral space) and physics (gridpoint space) with `PhysicsState` and `PhysicsTendency` structs
- **model.py** orchestrates time-stepping, combining dynamics and physics
- **Physics directory** is organized by physical process. Files are named after the **scheme** (e.g. `convection/tiedtke_nordeng/`, `clouds/sundqvist.py`, `aerosol/macv2_sp.py`), not the model they were ported from. Model-specific *infrastructure* (parameter containers, coords, data structs) stays under `speedy/` and `icon/`.
- Configuration is managed via **Hydra** (see `jcm/config/`)
- Supports multiple resolutions: T21 to T425 spectral truncations
- SPMD sharding support for multi-device execution

### Coordinate and terrain system

The grid/geometry system is split into three layers with clear separation of concerns:

1. **CoordinateSystem** (from `dinosaur`) — horizontal and vertical discretization, created via `utils.get_coords(sigma_boundaries, ...)`. This is physics-agnostic.

2. **TerrainData** (`terrain.py`) — runtime boundary conditions (orography, land-sea mask). Immutable and physics-agnostic. Has factory classmethods: `from_coords()`, `from_file()`, `aquaplanet()`, `single_column()`.

3. **SpeedyCoords** (`physics/speedy/speedy_coords.py`) — SPEEDY-specific precomputed coordinate transforms (sigma layers, trig functions). Cached on the physics object at init time via `cache_coords()`.

**Model initialization pattern:**
```python
from jcm.model import Model
from jcm.terrain import TerrainData
from jcm.physics.speedy.speedy_coords import get_speedy_coords
from jcm.physics.speedy.speedy_terms import speedy_physics

# 1. Create coordinate system (includes sigma boundaries)
coords = get_speedy_coords(layers=8, spectral_truncation=31)

# 2. Create terrain boundary conditions
terrain = TerrainData.from_coords(coords)  # or .aquaplanet()

# 3. Create model (physics caches coords internally)
model = Model(coords=coords, terrain=terrain, physics=speedy_physics())
```

**Key design principles:**
- **Static config** (coordinates, physics transforms) is set once at init and cached
- **Dynamic config** (terrain, forcing) can vary per simulation
- Physics classes implement `cache_coords(coords)` to precompute coordinate-dependent data
- Data structs use `@classmethod` factories (`.from_coords()`, `.from_file()`, `.aquaplanet()`) for clear construction intent
- `TerrainData` replaced the old monolithic `Geometry` class — terrain is now separate from coordinate configuration
