# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

A Bun plugin that makes `.php` files importable: `import { greet } from "./hello.php"` returns an async JS
function that calls into a PHP 8.5 interpreter running in WebAssembly (php-wasm). No PHP binary involved.
Published as the `bun-php` package; `src/` ships as-is (no build step — `exports` points straight at `.ts`).

## Commands

```bash
bun install
bun test                          # all tests
bun test test/parse.test.ts       # one file
bun test -t "variadic"            # one test by name
bun run test:versions             # the cross-version compatibility suite (installed builds only)
bun run php-builds:install        # install every @php-wasm/node-8-* build (~370 MB), then
bun run php-builds:install 8.1    #   just one; both leave package.json and bun.lock untouched
bun run example                   # example/index.ts against example/hello.php
bun run demos                     # demos/index.ts against real Composer packages
bun run typecheck                 # bunx tsc -p tsconfig.json (noEmit)
bun run lint                      # oxlint (correctness rules)
bun run fmt                       # oxfmt, write in place
bun run fmt:check                 # oxfmt --check (what CI runs)

composer install --working-dir=demos   # required before demos/ runs or its tests
bun run demos:vendor:pack         # rebuild demos/vendor.zip (needs Composer; commit the result)
bun run demos:vendor:unpack       # unzip demos/vendor.zip into demos/vendor (what CI runs)
```

There is a lint step (oxlint + oxfmt) but no build step.

CI (`.github/workflows/test.yml`) runs on PRs and `main`: typecheck, lint, `fmt:check`, then unpacks
`demos/vendor.zip` and runs the tests on ubuntu + macos. The demo Composer deps are committed as
`demos/vendor.zip` (built by `demos:vendor:pack`) so CI needs neither Composer nor a system PHP —
regenerate and recommit that zip whenever `demos/composer.lock` changes. Releases go out via
`.github/workflows/release.yml`: release-please cuts the tag, then npm publishes over OIDC (no token).
`CHANGELOG.md` is in `.oxfmtrc.json`'s `ignorePatterns` because release-please regenerates it in its own
Markdown style — reformatting it only wins until the next release rewrites it, and `fmt:check` fails on
every release PR in the meantime.

## Architecture

The pipeline runs once per imported `.php` file, at load time:

```
onLoad (plugin.ts)
  → parsePhp (parse.ts)      PHP source  → PhpModuleMeta
  → generateModule (codegen.ts)  meta    → JS module source, returned to Bun
  → generateDts (dts.ts)         meta    → sidecar <file>.php.d.ts written next to the source
  → resolveProject (project.ts)  path    → { root to mount, autoload to require }
```

The generated module imports `createPhpModule` from `runtime.ts` and exports one async wrapper per PHP
function. At call time: `runtime.ts` → `marshal.ts` (build the PHP script, decode the result) →
`interpreter.ts` → `php-runtime.ts` (the interpreter).

## Things that will bite you

**Registration must happen via `preload`.** ES module resolution beats `Bun.plugin()` called from the
importing file. `bunfig.toml` preloads `./src/register.ts` twice — once at top level, once under `[test]`,
because the top-level `preload` does not apply to `bun test`. The e2e tests depend on that second entry.

**Generated code imports the runtime by absolute path** (`RUNTIME_PATH` in `plugin.ts`), not by the
`bun-php/runtime` specifier, so it resolves the same whether bun-php is a dependency, a link, or this repo.

**Interpreters are cached on `globalThis`** (`__bunPhpInstances` in `runtime.ts`), not in a module variable —
`bun --hot` resets the module registry on every save and would otherwise leak an interpreter per edit. The
cache key is `JSON.stringify` of everything serialisable (source, stdout mode, root, autoload, runtime
options); `loader` and `spawn` are functions and are compared by identity. Anything new that changes which
interpreter to boot must land in that key, or a caller asking for it silently gets the cached one. The same
`--hot` concern drives the "skip the write if the content is unchanged" guard in `writeSidecar`: rewriting
churns mtime and retriggers the watcher in a loop.

**An autoloader is only ever required when the root is mounted.** `plugin.ts` passes `autoload: false` to
`resolveProject` when `mount: false`, and `PhpInstance` drops the autoload path whenever it takes the
mkdir+writeFile fallback instead of mounting — a `require_once` of a host path that is not in the virtual
filesystem is an `E_COMPILE_ERROR` on _every_ call, not just the first. That includes an explicitly
configured `autoload: "<path>"`: emitting it under `mount: false` produced dead configuration, since
`PhpInstance` drops it again anyway. Reach for `createPhpModule` directly to pair a root-less module
with an autoloader you mount yourself.

**Short tags are pinned off, which is why nothing has to keep the parser and the runtime in step.**
`PINNED_INI` in `php-runtime.ts` is applied by `bootPhp` _after_ the journal, so no op can outrank it, and
php-parser's own default already matches — no `lexer` options, no invariant to remember. PHP's built-in
default is on only because no `php.ini` ships with the wasm builds, and that disagreement made a `<?` file
export nothing while the runtime happily ran it. `withoutPinned` logs and then _strips_ the entry, because
`ini()` applies to an instance that is already running, where the boot-time pin never gets to correct
it — warning about an override that still took effect was the worst of both. `<?=` is unaffected: it has been
unconditional since PHP 5.4.

**One journal configures every instance.** A `JournalOp` (`php-runtime.ts`) is plain data: mount, mkdir,
writeFile, ini. `PhpInterpreter` turns its `ini`/`mounts` options into journal ops at construction and
`bootPhp(options, ops)` replays them onto every fresh instance, so there is no separate "apply options" step
to drift from it. `PhpInstance` seeds its interpreter's journal with either a mount of the project root or —
when the _module file_ is not on disk, a bundle running elsewhere — a mkdir plus writeFile of the inlined
source. The gate is the file, not the directory: a root that exists without the file mounts happily and
then fatals on the `require_once` of every call. The same journal is what `isolation: "process"` ships to its child.

**`PHP.cli()` consumes its instance.** It calls `exit()` on the runtime when the command finishes, and a
second `cli()` on the same instance returns exit code **-1 with no output and no error at all**. So `#cli`
takes the boot promise and sets `#instance` to `null` _before_ awaiting it; the next `cli()` (or `mount()`)
boots a replacement and replays the journal. `#apply` awaits `php()` _before_ recording an op, because a
boot replays the journal and recording first would run the new op twice on the very first call.

**A journal op is recorded only once it has applied.** `#apply` boots first (a boot replays the journal, so
recording first would run the op twice) and pushes only after `applyOp` resolves. Pushing first meant a
`mount()` that rejected still replayed onto every later boot: the caller was told it failed while it broke
every subsequent `cli()` with an opaque error.

**`timeoutMs` exists only under `isolation: "process"`.** There is no in-process deadline anywhere:
php-wasm cannot interrupt a running request, so a timer could only reject the caller's promise while the
PHP burned on, and that was worse than nothing (see the measurements below). `PhpInterpreter.cli()` reads
`timeoutMs` inside the isolation branch and nowhere else, and it is off both `PhpModuleRuntimeOptions` and
`CreatePhpModuleOptions["runtime"]` — a module's `timeoutMs` was once accepted, documented and silently
ignored, so `assertSerialisable` in `plugin.ts` now rejects it rather than letting that return.
A caller who only wants to stop waiting races a timer themselves; say so wherever it comes up.
`killedByDeadline` in `isolation.ts` requires a `signalCode` before it blames the deadline: a timer firing
as the child exits kills a corpse and would otherwise discard the complete reply it left in stdout.
`PhpInstance` still tracks every call in `#running`, not to survive a deadline but so `$reset()` and
`$dispose()` can drain in-flight work before exiting the runtime under it.

**A rejected boot is not cached.** `php()` clears `#instance` when `bootPhp` rejects, so a transient
failure does not replay on every later call until `$reset()`.

**`$reset()` and `$dispose()` are lazy.** Both wait for in-flight calls (`#running`), then `dispose()` the
interpreter; `reset()` clears the captured buffer _after_ that drain, or a call finishing during it refills
the buffer past the reset. the next call re-boots and the journal re-mounts the root from scratch. That is why
php-wasm's `hotSwapPHPRuntime` is not used — a hot swap would copy the old MEMFS across, and `$reset` exists
to discard it. `$dispose` also drops the cache entry, but only while it still points at this instance, so
disposing a stale `--hot` handle does not evict its replacement.

**The call protocol is a JSON envelope between a sentinel pair**, not plain stdout parsing. PHP flushes open
output buffers to stdout on a fatal error, so the script's own `echo` output can land ahead of the envelope,
and user shutdown functions or destructors can print after it; the envelope is the JSON between the _last_
sentinel pair, and everything around it is script output. Any change to `buildCallScript` needs the matching
change in `EnvelopeSplitter`/`unwrapEnvelope`.

**Output is streamed, which is why `buildCallScript` does not `ob_start()`.** The script runs unbuffered
(`ob_implicit_flush(true)`) so `echo` reaches stdout as it happens, and `runtime.ts` reads `runStream()`'s
`response.stdout` chunk by chunk instead of awaiting `stdoutText`. `EnvelopeSplitter` in `marshal.ts` does the
classifying: a sentinel can straddle a chunk boundary (so a tail that could still grow into one is held
back), a sentinel pair whose contents are not JSON was never an envelope (so it is put back verbatim), and
_last pair wins_ means output after an envelope is held until the stream ends, in case a later one supersedes
it. `test/marshal.test.ts` feeds the splitter whole strings and chunk-by-chunk, so the two cannot drift.
A failed pair puts back only its _opening_ sentinel and stays in-envelope, so the closing one becomes the
next opener: otherwise one stray sentinel in the script's output shifts the pairing by one and the real
envelope is emitted as text.
Only buffers the _user's_ code opened and left open still arrive in the envelope's `out` field, and
`end()` releases them before the output held after the envelope, because PHP wrote them first.

**Values cross by JSON, so `NaN`/`Infinity` only survive as a whole argument.** `encodeValue` turns a
top-level one into PHP's `NAN`/`INF`, but `phpVar` encodes anything else through JSON, where they become
`null`; `nonFinitePath` finds a nested one and throws instead of losing it silently — it carries a `WeakSet`,
because a cycle would otherwise blow the stack before `phpVar` could report it as an encoding failure.
Nested `undefined` is deliberately _not_ in that rule: it follows JSON, becoming `null` in an array and a
dropped key in an object, which is what JavaScript callers already expect. `encodeArgs` builds its
list by index rather than `.map`, which skips array holes and used to emit the invalid `f(, 1)`.

**Every call is a fresh PHP request.** `buildCallScript` re-`require_once`s the module and the Composer
autoloader each time because php-wasm resets request-scoped state (declared functions and autoloaders
included) between runs. That is also why `static` variables and globals do not persist across calls — a
documented limitation, and `test/e2e.test.ts` asserts it.

**Calls on one instance never overlap, and nothing in bun-php queues them.** php-wasm's `runStream` holds a
concurrency-1 semaphore until the request finishes, and every response has its own stdout stream. That is
why `inline.ts` has no task queue and `PhpInstance` has no lifecycle serialiser: `test/inline.test.ts`
fires twelve concurrent captures and asserts their outputs and return values stay separate.

**The inline tag prints; `BunPHP.capture` returns.** `BunPHP` matches the plugin's `stdout: "inherit"`
default, while `BunPHP.capture` resolves to the output and prints nothing. Both share _one_ interpreter,
created `"inherit"`: `capture` passes `$eval` an output sink, which overrides the instance's stdout mode for
that call alone. A sink per call is what keeps a snippet that throws part-way through printing from leaving
its output behind for the next snippet.

**Inline snippets are read from `strings.raw`, not the cooked segments.** The snippet is PHP source, and
cooked strings let JavaScript consume its escapes first: `preg_match('/\d+/')` silently became `/d+/`, a
leading `\` on a class name disappeared, and an invalid escape made the segment `undefined`, which `?? ""`
turned into an erased snippet returning `null`. Raw segments are never `undefined`, so both go away together.
The cost is that a template's `\n` is now PHP's escape rather than JavaScript's; write real newlines.

**Inline snippets interpolate as expressions, not text.** `src/inline.ts` runs every interpolated value
through `encodeValue()` from `marshal.ts`, so a value can never be executed as code; `test/inline.test.ts`
asserts that with real injection payloads. **A snippet is code, not a template.** It is evaluated inside a
closure, which already starts in code mode, so `asClosureBody` only sheds the tags a PHP _file_ would need:
a leading `<?php` is dropped, a leading `<?=` becomes `echo `, and a trailing `?>` becomes `;`, which is
what keeps `<?= 6 * 7 ?>` valid once its tag is gone. Everything else is left for PHP's own lexer to
judge — a `?>` in a string, a comment or a heredoc, and every mid-snippet tag. Markup is not supported: a
snippet that starts or ends in HTML reaches PHP as code and fails with PHP's own parse error, and a bare
`<?` is untouched (short tags are pinned off) so PHP rejects that too. `asClosureBody` is exported so
`test/inline.test.ts` can unit-test both rules without booting wasm.

**Aliasing has one source of truth.** `bindingNameFor` (exported from `codegen.ts`) decides the local binding
for a PHP name, and `exportLines` turns that into either a direct export or an alias plus re-export;
`codegen.ts`, `dts.ts` and the uniqueness guard in `parse.ts` all go through them so they cannot drift.
`parse.ts` also reserves the generated module's own identifiers (`__mod`, `createPhpModule`, `_default`,
`default`), skipping any PHP name that would collide — `define()` accepts names a `const` declaration cannot.
Every module-API member is `$`-prefixed and a PHP function name cannot start with `$`, so no PHP function
can collide with the API: `createPhpModule` spreads the functions first and adds the `$` members after, and
every function fits on the default export with no special case. The API's `call` was renamed `$call` to
make that true — it was the one un-prefixed member, and it cost a name registry, a `dts.ts` skip and a
"Named export only" trailer in both generators.
A constant whose value JavaScript cannot reproduce faithfully is `NOT_LITERAL` rather than a guess: an
array key past 2^53 (rounding it collides two entries or restarts the implicit key at zero), and an
implicit key following a negative one, which PHP 8.3 resumes at `-4` where 8.0-8.2 restart at `0` — the
parser has no idea which build `phpVersion` will select. `isDefineCall` strips one leading `\` before
comparing, because namespaced code writes `\define(...)` to skip the runtime fallback lookup; `A\define`
is a genuinely different function and stays ignored.
`RESERVED` in `codegen.ts` is _ECMAScript's_ invalid-binding list (reserved words + strict-mode additions +
`arguments`/`eval`), not PHP's keyword list: `define()` can hand codegen any name at all. Beware that Bun's
transpiler tolerates the strict-mode-only subset (`implements`…`yield`) while its module loader rejects them,
so `Bun.Transpiler` alone is not proof a generated module loads — `test/e2e.test.ts` imports a `yield`
constant through the real loader for exactly that reason. `example/hello.php.d.ts` is the only committed
sidecar, so a refactor that changes it has changed generated output for everyone: regenerate it by
running the example rather than hand-editing, and make sure the diff is one you meant.

**Type-mapping changes** go in `TS_TYPES` in `php-types.ts`, which mirrors php-parser's own
`TypeReference.types` list — nothing else can reach it, since docblock tags are not read. A name outside
that list never reaches the map at all: a class name arrives as a `name` node and becomes
`Record<string, unknown>`, while `self` and `parent` get their own node kinds (`selfreference`,
`parentreference`) and fall to the `any` default — which is why dropping the `self` key was safe, and
why `static`, which really is a `typereference`, had to stay. Lookup goes through `tsType`, whose
`Object.hasOwn` is belt-and-braces: php-parser only mints `typereference` for those 15 names, so a
type spelled `constructor` cannot reach it today, but the map is a plain object literal.
All that is left of the old precedence rule is `declaredType` in `parse.ts`: the declaration, with `?T`
folding its null through `nullable`. `members` splits a converted type at bracket depth 0 and is what
`union`, `nullable` and `parenthesised` all agree on, so a `|` or a `null` nested inside brackets is not
mistaken for a top-level one. Docblocks are still read, but only for the summary: `docSummary` in
`parse.ts` stops at the first `@tag` and the rest becomes the function's JSDoc.

**The plugin's `runtime` option is the serialisable half of `PhpRuntimeOptions`.** It is emitted into the
generated module by `generateModule`, so `PhpModuleRuntimeOptions` drops `loader` and function-valued
`spawn` (neither survives `JSON.stringify`) and `isolation` (which `createPhpModule` refuses outright).
It also drops `timeoutMs`, for a different reason: a module call has no deadline, so carrying it would be
dead configuration. `assertSerialisable` in `plugin.ts` repeats all of that for JavaScript callers, and
`createPhpModule` throws for `timeoutMs` beside its existing `isolation` guard, because the type-level
`Omit` alone left the direct caller free to pass one in JavaScript and have it quietly do nothing. The
key is omitted entirely when unset, so a module without runtime options generates byte-identically to
before.

**PHP version selection lives in `BUILD_PACKAGES` in `php-runtime.ts`**, a map from version to
`@php-wasm/node-X-Y` resolved with a dynamic `import()`. `buildImportError` classifies a failed import
rather than assuming: only an `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` whose `specifier` is the build package itself is
`PhpBuildNotInstalledError` with its `bun add` advice — a transitive dependency failing inside an installed
build would otherwise be answered with "install what you already have" —
and anything else — a build that resolved but threw — is `PhpBuildLoadError`, so the message never sends
someone to install what they already have. Only 8.5 is a real dependency; the rest are optional
peer dependencies, because each build is tens of MB of wasm. `@php-wasm/node` is deliberately avoided — it
statically imports a NAN native addon that throws at module-evaluation time when its binding fails to load,
which is also why `nodeFsMountHandler` is implemented here against the Emscripten FS directly.

**Every build is tested, and installing one is not what you would guess.** `test/versions.test.ts`
is the only cross-version coverage: it drives the real paths (module calls, marshalling, envelope
ordering, errors, `cli()`, `ini`, mount, `isolation: "process"`) against each build, and CI runs it as a
`php-versions` matrix of one build per job. `BUN_PHP_VERSIONS` names the targets; unset, it covers
whichever builds are installed, so locally that is 8.3 and 8.5. An explicitly named version is never
filtered out by the "is it installed" check — otherwise a job whose install step failed would pass on
zero tests, which is exactly what the `build discovery` block guards. The sixth matrix leg is `default`,
not `8.5`: it passes no `phpVersion` at all, so the `?? PHP_VERSION` fallback is what gets exercised.
`test/fixtures/e2e.php` is that suite's fixture as well as the e2e one, so it has to stay PHP
8.0-compatible — the 8.0 job enforces this, but a snippet with a deprecation notice on one build and not
another will flake rather than fail cleanly.

Installing a build needs `scripts/php-builds-install.ts`, because **both obvious commands silently do
nothing**: `bun add --no-save` resolves the tree from package.json, where these are only optional peers,
and a plain `bun add` skips a package that is already declared as one. The script strips the peer
declaration first, runs a real `bun add`, and restores package.json and bun.lock — which is why the
version job can install 8.1 without disturbing `test/interpreter.test.ts` and `test/isolation.test.ts`,
whose three `skipIf(isBuildInstalled("8.1"))` tests still assume 8.1 is absent in every other job.

**Neither timeouts nor parallelism work the way you would assume in-process**, both measured:

- A running request cannot be interrupted. `PHP.exit()` mid-call returns without stopping it (a busy loop then
  ran to completion), and `max_execution_time` is ignored — a 2s limit let an 8s loop finish. That is why
  there is no in-process `timeoutMs` at all: a deadline that could only reject the caller's promise while the
  PHP kept burning CPU bought nothing, so callers who want to stop waiting `Promise.race` a timer themselves.
  Say so wherever it is documented; a timeout that implies cancellation is worse than none.
- Interpreters do not overlap. Two concurrent 1s calls on two instances take ~2s (ratio 1.96), because the
  wasm holds the thread. That is why there is no pool API — a second interpreter in-process buys nothing, and
  `test/interpreter.test.ts` pins the ratio so nobody adds one on a hunch.

**`isolation: "process"` exists because of the previous paragraph**, plus one more measurement: the wasm heap
retains hundreds of MB across in-process boot/dispose cycles (35 MB baseline → 300–800 MB after a handful,
forced GC included) and the OS reclaiming an exited child is the only thing that returns it. Each `cli()`
spawns `src/isolation-runner.ts`, ships `{ options: { phpVersion, spawn }, journal, argv }` as JSON on stdin,
and SIGKILLs on timeout — so `timeoutMs` exists here and nowhere else, concurrent calls really overlap
(1.04x measured), and a wasm abort takes only the child. The constructor rejects `loader` and function-valued
`spawn` up front because they cannot cross the JSON boundary, `php()` throws for the same reason, and
`createPhpModule` refuses `runtime.isolation` outright — the imported-module path runs many small calls
against one live instance, the opposite shape. The runner constructs a plain in-process
`PhpInterpreter(options, journal)`: the child _is_ the isolation, and reusing `cli()` keeps the two paths from
diverging. Errors cross through `serialiseError`/`reviveError`, which carry the fields of bun-php's own error
types so `instanceof`, `packageName`/`phpClass` and the cause's message survive the JSON boundary; an
unknown name stays a plain `Error`.

**Interleaving `mount()`/`writeFile()` with a concurrent `cli()` is not supported.** `#apply` awaits `php()`
and then applies the op, and in between a `cli()` can consume and exit that very instance. Twenty attempts
across both orderings produced no spurious rejection — `cli()` nulls `#instance` synchronously, so a
concurrent op boots its own — so there is no serialiser for a race nobody has reproduced. Do the setup
before the call.

**Sidecar `.d.ts` files:** `test/fixtures/*.php.d.ts` and `demos/php/*.php.d.ts` are gitignored (regenerated
on the next run); `example/hello.php.d.ts` is committed on purpose as a worked example. `demos/vendor/` is
gitignored, `demos/composer.lock` is committed.

## Comments

Comment the **why**, never the what — the code already says what it does. Max **one sentence** per
comment; two only for a genuinely complex piece (a non-obvious constraint, a bug worked around, an
ordering dependency). Longer rationale belongs in this file or the README, not in the source. Prefer
no comment to an obvious one.

## Bun conventions

Default to Bun over Node.js: `bun <file>`, `bun test`, `bun install`, `bun run <script>`, `bunx <pkg>`.
Prefer `Bun.file`/`Bun.write` over `node:fs` (test helpers use `node:fs/promises` for tmpdir work, which is
fine). Bun loads `.env` automatically — no dotenv. Bun API docs are in `node_modules/bun-types/docs/**.mdx`.

## Pull requests

release-please cuts releases from what lands on `main`, and this repo squash-merges with
`COMMIT_OR_PR_TITLE` — so on a branch with more than one commit **the PR title becomes the release
commit's subject**. It has to be a conventional commit (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, …): a title with no type
is not parsed at all and ships no release. A breaking change is a `!` after the type (`feat!:`), and that
is what bumps the major — the `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer alone will not do it if the subject never parses.

Keep PR descriptions brief and concise: a sentence on what and why, a short bullet per change, and a
`BREAKING CHANGE` list when there is one. The commits and the diff carry the detail; do not restate them
at length.
