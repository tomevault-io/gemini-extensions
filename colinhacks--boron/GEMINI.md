## Git

**Commit straight to `main`.** No branches, no pull requests, no staging your work for review. When something is done, commit it and push it — a push deploys to [boron.sh](https://boron.sh) via Vercel, and that is fine.

**Don't spend effort on git hygiene.** Atomic commits, tidy history, branch strategy — none of it matters here. Do not stop to ask whether a commit is scoped cleanly, and do not leave finished work uncommitted because the diff also touches something else.

**Several agents may be working at once**, so the tree you are in probably contains edits that are not yours. That is normal and expected:

- Leave other agents' changes alone. Don't revert them, don't "fix" them, and don't wait for them to finish.
- `git add` the paths you actually worked on and commit. If someone else's in-flight change rides along, that is acceptable — it is not worth a round trip to avoid.
- Your own files may get swept into someone else's commit before you get to them. Check `git log -- <path>` before assuming work was lost.
- The one thing that does bite: never rewrite shared history. No `rebase`, `reset --hard`, or force-push on `main` — other agents are working from it, and rewriting it destroys their work rather than just untidying yours.

## Toolchain

The package manager is **`nub`**, not npm or pnpm.

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `nub run dev` | Vite dev server |
| `nub run build` | `tsc --noEmit`, then a production build to `dist/` |
| `nub run test` | Vitest |
| `nub run typecheck` | `tsc --noEmit` alone |

`nub run build` is the gate — it typechecks before bundling, so a green build covers both.

This is a **Vite + React** app, not Next.js. There is a root `index.html` carrying all the page metadata, the entry is `src/main.tsx`, and static files are served from `public/` verbatim.

## Copy

Emojis are fine here — in the README, on the site, and in commit messages. The general prose guide bans them; this project overrides that.

## Persisted state

The whole workspace — document, theme, backdrop and frame settings — is saved to `localStorage`. A changed default therefore reaches nobody who has already opened the app; their stored copy wins. When you change a default that everyone should get, bump `STORAGE_KEY` in `src/App.tsx`.

## Clipboard fixtures

`src/core/clipboard-fixtures.ts` holds rich-text clipboard payloads captured **verbatim from a real copy**. Terminals disagree enough about their `text/html` flavour that invented markup only tests your imagination — Ghostty marks every styled run as a `<div style="display: inline">`, VS Code and Konsole use one block element per row, and Terminal.app states its colours only in class-based CSS in a `<style>` block, with each row's dominant colour on the `<p>` and the runs that differ overriding it.

**Capture HTML the way the app receives it — off a real paste event, not off the pasteboard.** On macOS those are not the same thing. Terminal.app and iTerm2 write no HTML flavour at all, only `public.rtf`, and inspecting the pasteboard makes them look unsupportable. They aren't: Chrome converts RTF through `NSAttributedString` on the way in, so the page is handed a full `text/html` that the pasteboard never held. That conversion lives in Chromium's `clipboard_mac.mm` and exists **only on macOS**, which is why we parse `text/rtf` ourselves too — see `rtf-paste.ts`. RTF has no such subtlety and can be read straight off the pasteboard.

**The RTF parser is ours on purpose, and it was not the first choice.** Both npm candidates were evaluated and both lose on the same point — this is a browser bundle. [`@iarna/rtf-parser`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rtf-parser) is the general one, but it is Node streams plus `iconv-lite`, unmaintained since 2019, ships **no tests at all**, and does not implement `\uc` — so it emits the fallback characters after every `\u` as text. [`rtf-stream-parser`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rtf-stream-parser) is maintained and dependency-free, but it exists to de-encapsulate HTML out of Outlook mail and does not surface per-run colours. Ours costs about a kilobyte; `iconv-lite` alone is a thousand times that, and the browser already ships every decoder it contains as `TextDecoder`.

What we took from prior art instead was the testing. The conformance block in `rtf-paste.test.ts` is `rtf-stream-parser`'s tokenizer suite restated against our own fixtures, and it caught four real bugs: `\bin`'s payload being scanned for control words, a truncated `\'` escape eating the character past it, `\~` dropped, and no `\plain`. Two more came from running its example documents: a font's `\fcharset` has to outrank the document's `\ansicpg` (Outlook writes cp1252 documents full of Shift-JIS), and `\ansicpg1200` still means cp1252 for byte escapes. Against those documents we now reproduce its published expected output exactly. `@iarna/rtf-parser` also makes a good differential oracle — run it over the same copy and it agrees with us character for character, same text, same style boundaries.

There are therefore two parsers, and `withTerminal.ts` tries HTML first: it is the flavour every terminal that writes rich text at all will offer, and on macOS the two say the same thing because the HTML is made out of the RTF. A test pins that — both parsers must produce the same document, character for character, from the same copy. RTF is what is left when nothing made that conversion for us.

Two consequences worth knowing. Rich-text copy is often **off by default**: iTerm2 needs Cmd-Opt-C rather than Cmd-C, and Windows Terminal needs `copyFormatting` set — its default is plain text only. And a terminal that hands us colours may state them per *row* rather than per *run*; `defaultColors` in `html-paste.ts` is what stops those rows from painting a colour onto every character.

If you need to support another terminal, capture its real bytes and add them there rather than writing markup you believe it emits.

## Brand assets

Everything in `public/` — the mark, favicons, icons, the Open Graph card — is **generated**. Don't hand-edit those files; they will be overwritten.

```
node scripts/build-assets.mjs   # → public/*.svg
./scripts/rasterize.sh          # → public/*.png and favicon.ico
./scripts/render-og.sh          # → public/og.png
```

**The Open Graph card is the exception** and does not go through the SVG pipeline. It is set in JetBrains Mono, which lives in `node_modules` as a woff2; `rsvg-convert` resolves fonts through fontconfig, finds no system copy, and silently substitutes a generic mono. So the card is authored as HTML in `scripts/og-card.html` and rendered by headless Chrome. Edit the HTML, re-run `render-og.sh`, commit the PNG.

The cell grid, the gaps and the color ramp live as data at the top of `build-assets.mjs`, so retuning the mark is a one-line change that propagates to every asset. `src/ui/Logo.tsx` mirrors the same geometry for the in-app header and has to be updated alongside it.

Requires `rsvg-convert` (`brew install librsvg`) and ImageMagick.
