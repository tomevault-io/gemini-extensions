## 🎮 Project: Legends of Lore - Gothic Retro Side-Scrolling Fantasy Game

A 2D side-scrolling action-adventure game inspired by Castlevania and Altered Beast, featuring retro pixel art graphics with a dark gothic aesthetic. The game follows Gabriel Thorne, a monster hunter with beast transformation abilities, on his quest to defeat Count Vladok.

## 🚨 IMPORTANT: Use CoralCollective Agents for Development

This project uses the CoralCollective framework for AI-driven development. ALWAYS use the specialized agents through the Task tool for different aspects of game development.

### Required Development Workflow:
1. **Start with Project Architect**: Design game architecture and systems
2. **Technical Writer Phase 1**: Document game requirements and specifications  
3. **Specialized Development**: Use appropriate agents for each component
4. **QA & Testing**: Comprehensive testing of game mechanics
5. **Technical Writer Phase 2**: Final documentation and guides

## Common Commands

### Game Development Setup
```bash
# Create virtual environment (ALWAYS DO THIS FIRST)
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies (when package.json/requirements.txt exist)
pip install -r requirements.txt  # Python dependencies
npm install                       # Node dependencies for web build

# Game engine setup (to be determined - Phaser.js recommended for web/mobile)
npm install phaser                # If using Phaser.js
```

### Running the Game
```bash
# Development server (once implemented)
npm run dev                       # Start development server
npm run build                     # Build for production
npm run test                      # Run tests

# Mobile builds (future)
npm run build:ios                 # Build for iOS
npm run build:android             # Build for Android
```

### Using CoralCollective Agents
```bash
# Access agent system
python .coral/agent_runner.py list              # List available agents
python .coral/agent_runner.py run               # Run specific agent
python .coral/agent_runner.py workflow           # Run workflow

# Use subagent invocation in Claude

@frontend_developer "Build game UI"
@ai_ml_specialist "Implement enemy AI"
```

## Architecture

### Game Architecture (To Be Implemented)

#### Core Systems
1. **Game Engine**: Phaser.js (recommended) or PixiJS for web/mobile compatibility
2. **Backend**: Node.js/Express API for:
   - User authentication & profiles
   - Save game management
   - Leaderboards
   - In-app purchases
   - Ad serving integration
3. **Database**: PostgreSQL or MongoDB for user data
4. **State Management**: Redux or Zustand for game state
5. **Mobile**: Capacitor or React Native for mobile builds

## Development Tips

### Quick Start for New Features
1. Always start with the appropriate CoralCollective agent
2. Reference the concept PDF for game design decisions
3. Test on both web and mobile platforms
4. Ensure monetization doesn't affect core gameplay
5. Maintain the gothic aesthetic in all additions

### Performance Guidelines
- Target 60 FPS on modern mobile devices
- Keep sprite sheets under 2048x2048
- Minimize draw calls through batching
- Use object pooling for frequently spawned entities
- Compress audio files appropriately

### Monetization Best Practices
- Free players must be able to complete the game
- Subscription benefits should enhance, not gate content
- Ad placements should not interrupt gameplay
- Clear value proposition for subscription
- Transparent pricing and benefits
