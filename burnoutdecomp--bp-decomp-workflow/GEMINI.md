# Agent Operating Guide

Entry point for **any** agent working in this repo — Claude Code, Codex,
Antigravity, or a future API/LiteLLM loop. This file is intentionally tool-
agnostic. Coordination happens through files and a small CLI, never through any
one tool's private memory.

## Resuming ("continue")

If told only to "continue", do this: if `progress/ledger.sqlite` is missing (fresh
clone), run `work bootstrap` once — it inits submodules and rebuilds the ledger from
the committed `progress/status.json` + `progress/tu_deps.json`, restoring exactly where
the last commit left off. Then `work claim` → pick up the next ready TU. No other context
is needed. (If the maintainer gave you a coordination-server URL, set it up first — see
"Coordination server" below; otherwise you work locally, no setup needed.)

**Continuing the verification sweep** (a distinct task from "continue" reconstruction):
if asked to continue, resume, or run the **verify sweep** — the correctness audit that
re-verifies every already-`done` TU against the X360 asm and fixes divergences — read
[`progress/sweep/VERIFY_SWEEP_HANDOFF.md`](progress/sweep/VERIFY_SWEEP_HANDOFF.md) first. It is the
self-contained operating guide for that pass; its state/queue lives in
[`progress/verify_sweep.json`](progress/verify_sweep.json) (per-TU `state`:
`pending`/`pass`/`fixed`/`flagged`/`conductor_fix`/`not_reconstructed`).

### Environment Checklist (Verify Before Reconstructing)

Before compiling code or exporting functions, verify these settings:
1. **Visual Studio / MSVC Path:** MSVC is auto-located by [`tools/build/msvc_env.bat`](tools/build/msvc_env.bat) (live `cl` 19.x, then default VS2022 installs, then `vswhere`). Only set the `VCVARS64` environment variable if VS2022 lives somewhere non-standard. If no MSVC is found, the compile gate reports `skip`, meaning errors won't be caught. Compile flags/includes are the canonical `tools/build/msvc_flags.txt` + `msvc_includes.txt` — the same set the shipping exe build uses.
2. **IDA Pro Path:** If you need to generate stubs/skeletons for new functions or run the parallel exporter, make sure `idat.exe` is available. You can pass the path explicitly via the `-IdaPath` parameter to `tools/export_db.ps1`, or set the `IDA_PATH` environment variable.
3. **Submodules:** The `b5-decomp` EA vendor submodules must be initialized. `work bootstrap` does this, but you can verify them under `b5-decomp/vendor/`.
4. **Coordination config (only if invited):** If the maintainer gave you a server URL, `cp .env.example .env`, uncomment `WORK_SERVER`, set it to that URL, and set a unique `WORK_AGENT`. With no URL, skip this entirely — you work locally. See "Coordination server" below.
5. **Building the exe / game data:** follow [BUILD.md](BUILD.md). Machine paths live in `build.config.toml` (copy from `build.config.example.toml`); `build doctor` verifies the whole toolchain and `build all` sequences tools → lua → ffmpeg → exe → data.

## Read first, in order

1. [`README.md`](README.md) — what this repo is (orchestration, not the decomp).
2. [`STRATEGY.md`](STRATEGY.md) — the plan, the build roles, the identity model,
   the stub scaffold, and what "done" means. **Do not start work without it.**
3. The ledger under [`progress/`](progress/) — current state of every TU/function.

## What you are doing

Reconstructing the **X360 build** as compilable **PC C++**, one translation unit
at a time, landing recovered code in [`b5-decomp/src`](b5-decomp/src/). Target is
**semantic parity, not byte-matching**. A unit is done when: reconstructed → the
TU compiles → a reviewer pass approves.

## The work loop

```
work claim <tu>...    # claim specific TU id(s) — when you want a particular one
work claim [-n N]     # ...or, with no id, claim the next N ready TUs from the queue.
                      #   With a coordination server (invite-only, see below) every claim
                      #   is atomic across everyone; without one it claims locally.
work next             # read-only PREVIEW of the queue (reserves nothing)
work show <tu>        # concise overview (functions, signatures, dependency TUs, console audit)
work audit <tu>       # the per-commit evidence audit for the TU: what the console's functions do
                      #   that our bodies don't (case ids, event posts, callees, asserts, bodies) + stubs
                      #   + the instruction shape of the BUILT exe vs the console (tier A/B/C per function)
work show <tu> --full # the full dossier: pseudocode, locals, DecFIGS dwarfdump
                      #   hints, Feb-2007 original source, callee signatures
                      #   (--asm for disasm, -o to a file)
work start <tu>       # claim one specific TU by id (todo -> in_progress) — use when you
                      #   already know which TU you want; `work claim` is the normal path
work stubs <tu>       # trap-stub the callees this TU needs that aren't done yet
                      #   (--list shows what must be declared — the part that matters
                      #   under the compile-only gate; defs are for the future link)
  …reconstruct the C++ into b5-decomp/src/<mirrored path>…
work submit <tu>      # run the compile gate; on pass, run the parity check + emit a reviewer packet
work parity <tu>      # standalone NO-LLM structural parity check (no status change)
work postmortem <tu>  # SELF-REVIEW packet: full dossier WITH X360 asm + a checklist to
                      #   re-verify your reconstruction against ARTIST (pseudocode+asm), then
                      #   DecFIGS (DWARF), before you submit/review (see "Postmortem" below)
  …review per policy (see Verification) — tiered, may be skipped or delegated…
work review <tu> --verdict pass|fail [--notes "…"]   # record the verdict
work block <tu> "…"   # mark blocked + reason so it is not reclaimed
work reset-tu <tu>    # delete produced files + return TU/functions to todo locally and server-side
```

**Goal scoping (optional, milestone-driven ordering).** By default `work next` is
whole-program leaf-first. To drive toward a concrete milestone (e.g. "boot to the main
menu", "reach the loading screen") instead, set an **active goal** — `work next` then
ranks **only** the TUs in that goal's scope, keeping leaf-first order within it
(dependency counts are computed against in-scope TUs only: out-of-scope callees stay
`todo` for the whole goal and get trap-stubbed regardless of order, so counting them
would permanently distort the ordering). Full reference (schema, the Xenia-trace
reproduction, the binary format):
[`references/GOAL_SCOPING.md`](references/GOAL_SCOPING.md).

A goal is a **membership selector**, not a call-graph closure: the X360 TU call graph is
a single ~75%-of-the-program strongly-connected component, so reachability/closure cannot
carve out a milestone (any boot seed's closure is 75% of the game). Each goal is therefore
defined in [`progress/goals.json`](progress/goals.json) by `include`/`exclude` glob lists
(`*` = any chars) matched against each TU's id **and** the function names it contains —
so `GameSource/Gui/**` matches by path, `BrnGui::*` by namespace, `*Director*` by either.

```
work goal                     # list defined goals + the active one (with TU/done counts)
work goal set <name>          # make <name> active (scopes `work next`)
work goal show <name>         # scope size, % done, and the BOUNDARY report:
                              #   which out-of-scope TUs in-scope code calls (→ trap-stubbed)
work goal clear               # back to whole-program leaf-first
```

Use `work goal show` to tune the globs: the boundary report tells you exactly what a
scope will stub vs. pull in, so you can widen/narrow it deliberately.

**Division of labor:** glob goals are for **subsystem slices** ("all GUI", "all replay
serialisers") where a pattern *is* the intent. For **milestones** ("boots to the main
menu"), use an execution-derived trace goal — only a real run knows what a milestone
needs. The glob goals shipped in `goals.json` are approximate pattern slices, not
runnable-milestone scopes.

**Execution-derived goals (best scoping — what actually ran).** Globs approximate; an
*execution trace* gives the exact set a milestone needs. Run the real X360 build in Xenia
with `trace_functions`/`trace_function_data` enabled (see header of
[`tools/work/trace_import.py`](tools/work/trace_import.py)) up to the milestone, then:

```
work goal import-trace <name> [--trace-dir DIR]   # default DIR = .trace/funcdata
```

It parses Xenia's funcdata chunks → executed guest addresses → `identity.json` names →
TUs, and writes a goal whose `include_tus` is that exact set (kernel import thunks, which
don't map to game names, are dropped). A 30 s boot-to-attract capture yields ~925 TUs
(21%) vs. the 75% static closure — and it's *real*, only the code that executed. Re-import
after pushing the milestone further (window → menu → in-race) to grow the scope. Traces
are large/binary and git-ignored (`.trace/`); the derived TU list lives in `goals.json`.

Mind the **TU granularity caveat**: one executed function pulls in its whole TU, so the
TU count understates the work (the boot trace's 925 TUs hold ~13.4k functions vs ~1.9k
executed). The import also stores the executed **function** list (`executed_funcs`) —
`work goal show` reports that coverage and flags mostly-unexecuted mega-TUs (e.g.
`class:<global>`, 5,186 functions pulled in by a handful that ran); carve those out via
the goal's `exclude_tus` list, which survives re-imports. The dossier marks each function
in an in-scope TU as executed / not executed in the active goal's trace.

**Deterministic auto-draft (NO-LLM, optional sweep).** `work auto --scan` reports the
TUs that are *fully mechanical* — every function is a pure forwarder (`return
Other::Fn(args);`) or a compiler thunk (deleting destructors, which are dropped, not
written). `work auto --run [-n N]` drafts those, runs them through the normal compile
gate, and records the ones that pass+parity-GREEN as done gate-only; the rest revert to
the agent. It never overwrites an existing file and skips header-keyed TUs. The payoff is
small and *latent* — most mechanical functions live in mixed TUs, and a cold draft only
compiles once its class/callees are type-recovered — so treat it as an opportunistic
sweep to re-run as headers fill in, not a substitute for reconstruction. Implemented in
[`tools/work/auto_draft.py`](tools/work/auto_draft.py).

**Batching.** Reconstruct one TU per pass by default. If the user names a count
("do 5"), claim that many dependency-ready TUs, reconstruct them in one pass, submit
each, then do a single combined review pass over the batch — it amortizes fixed cost.
The default count lives in `progress/review.config.json` (`batch.default_tus_per_pass`).
**CRITICAL:** When running a combined review pass, you must spawn **exactly ONE** subagent
total for the entire batch (or run the review CLI sequentially in a single command), passing
all review packets to it, rather than spawning one subagent per translation unit or per function.

## Coordination server (optional; access via a worker id)

By **default you work locally** — the ledger and git are the only state, exactly like a
solo workflow. Nothing in this section is required to do the work. The work server is an
**opt-in** layer the maintainer runs, gated by a server-issued worker id. If you have no
id, ignore it and just `work claim` / `work submit` locally.

Everything about the server — `.env` setup, worker-id minting/admin, the durable-vs-live
state stores, `work server-reset`, and `work server-update` / dashboard attribution —
lives in **[`references/COORDINATION.md`](references/COORDINATION.md)**. Read it only if
the maintainer invited you onto a server or you are running one.

## Verification (what `submit` / `review` expect)

1. **Compile gate.** `work submit` compiles the TU's `.cpp` (`cl /c`, no link) against
   current headers. On **fail** it prints the diagnostics and returns the TU to
   `in_progress` — fix and re-submit. On **pass** the TU goes `compiled` and a reviewer
   packet is written to `progress/reviews/<tu>.md`. (If no MSVC is found the gate
   reports `skip` and still proceeds — set `VCVARS64` or install VS2022; see
   `tools/build/msvc_env.bat`. The EA
   submodules must be checked out — `git -C b5-decomp submodule update --init` — for
   anything that includes EASTL/EABase to compile.)
2. **Automated parity (NO-LLM, advisory).** When `automated_check.enabled`, `work submit`
   prints a cheap deterministic structural fingerprint comparison after a clean compile
   gate (call/branch/loop/return counts of the X360 pseudocode vs the reconstructed C++,
   within `automated_check.tolerances`). `GREEN` = structurally consistent (a trivial/
   standard TU may skip the LLM review); `YELLOW` = mild drift (prefer a review); `RED` =
   gross divergence (review, and look hard at the flagged signal). It is **advisory only**
   — it never auto-fails a compiled TU, because semantic-parity reconstruction legitimately
   refactors. Run it any time on its own with `work parity <tu>`. Implemented in
   [`tools/work/parity.py`](tools/work/parity.py).
2b. **Faithfulness gate (NO-LLM, HARD — a decomp must not invent).** After a clean compile gate,
   `work submit` also runs [`tools/work/faithfulness_lint.py`](tools/work/faithfulness_lint.py) over
   the TU's files. Unlike parity this gate is **hard**: a TU that introduces a **new** invention smell
   returns to `in_progress` and never reaches a reviewer packet. It catches exactly what the compile
   gate and parity are blind to — `return null`/`{}` engine stubs that call themselves stubs, raw
   offset-hack casts (`*(T*)(p+N)`), `Apt*_<verb>` free-function shims standing in for real methods,
   home-grown-format vocabulary (`apt4`, `LocateMovieRoot`, "our converted", converter accommodations),
   and `#pragma pack(4)` layout accommodations. A genuine PC-platform leaf passes **only** when marked
   `// FLAG PC-platform leaf: <reason>`. It is a **ratchet** against
   [`progress/faithfulness_baseline.json`](progress/faithfulness_baseline.json), which grandfathers
   pre-existing debt so only NEW smells fail — **shrink** that baseline as you home real bodies; never
   blind-regenerate it (that hides fresh invention). Run it repo-wide any time with `work faithfulness`
   (`--all` lists every hit; `--baseline` re-snapshots after you deliberately pay debt down). Configure
   or disable via the `faithfulness` block in `progress/review.config.json`.
2c. **Evidence audit (NO-LLM, per commit, the dashboard's "Verified vs Console").** CI runs
   [`tools/re/funcaudit.py`](tools/re/funcaudit.py) and [`tools/re/stubaudit.py`](tools/re/stubaudit.py)
   against the whole tree on every b5-decomp commit and commits the results as
   `progress/funcaudit.json` / `progress/stubs.json`; the work server imports them and draws the
   Verified ring, the Console Evidence section and one Live Event per commit from them. They compare
   what the console's pseudocode STATES about a function with what our body states: a `case N:` the
   console has and we do not (`MISSING_CASE`), an `AddEvent` id we never post (`MISSING_EVENT`), a
   named callee we never call (`MISSING_CALLEE`), an assert expression we dropped (`MISSING_ASSERT`),
   a function the ledger names with no definition anywhere (`NO_BODY`), and, as context only, missing
   log strings, uncited data symbols and a parameter-count hint. **Before `work submit`, run
   `work audit <tu>`** (or read the block `work show <tu>` prints): every high-signal finding on a
   function you touched is a defect to fix or to explain in the review notes -- the ledger can say
   `done` while the ring says otherwise, and the ring is the one nobody declared. `work audit <tu>
   --refresh` re-runs the audit live for the TU's file from the packed feature cache
   (`progress/funcaudit_features.json.gz`, no IDA exports needed). What it cannot see: inlined
   callees, virtual dispatch, argument ORDER and the VALUE of a cited constant (`tools/re/constaudit.py`
   / `findinit.py` for those) -- a clean audit is "nothing nameable differs", not a match.
   **The third tier is the machine code.** The build job runs [`tools/re/asmaudit.py`](tools/re/asmaudit.py)
   on every published exe and commits `progress/asmaudit.json`: each function of the exe we BUILT
   against the console's own instructions -- the named callees, the conditional-branch count, the
   integer and float constants. Tier A same shape, B close, C diverges, T trivial. Byte-matching
   is impossible across the x64 widening, so a C is a diff to read, not a verdict: `python
   tools/re/asmaudit.py --func NAME` prints which callees and constants exist on one side only
   (`--asm` prints both streams); a callee MSVC inlined shows as "only on the console", a constant
   we never load is exactly what it looks like. `work audit <tu>` prints the TU's rows worst-first.
   For a function whose C++ is portable enough to compile for the console itself,
   [`tools/re/asmmatch.py`](tools/re/asmmatch.py) diffs PowerPC streams decomp.me-style (`--decfigs`
   against the PS3 rendering needs only the exports; `--compile` needs the Xbox 360 SDK, `$XEDK`).
3. **Reviewer pass — YOU choose, per `progress/review.config.json`.** Not every TU
   needs a separate full review; an always-on Opus review per TU is the main quota sink.
   The config is a **menu + policy, not an auto-router**: you (the reverser agent) read
   it and decide, per TU, whether to review and with what. After a clean compile gate:
   - **Classify** the TU as `trivial | standard | complex` (`review.classify_hints`).
   - If `review.enabled` is false, or the class is `trivial` (per `selection_guidance`):
     **skip** the pass — the compile gate + your own self-check is the gate. Record it
     yourself: `work review … --verdict pass --notes "trivial; gate-only"`.
   - Otherwise **choose** a provider+model from `providers` (only those with `have:true`)
     and a thinking level inside that model's allowed range, following `selection_guidance`
     (cheapest capable for `standard`; stronger + more thinking for `complex`; bump a notch
     via `escalate_when_unsure` when you doubt your own work — FP precision, signedness,
     guessed offsets, inferred data tables). **You make the call**; deviate with a noted
     reason when a TU warrants it.
    - **Invoke your choice yourself:**
      - **In-Session Sub-agent Flow:** If you have native tool capabilities to spawn sub-agents directly in your session (e.g., an `invoke_subagent` or task-spawning tool), and the model it spawns is appropriate for the selected task tier (without being an unnecessary resource or quota drain compared to a smaller CLI-accessible model), you should prefer to spawn the chosen model as a **fresh-eyes sub-agent** directly, giving it **only** the path to the review packet `progress/reviews/<tu>.md` — do not share your reconstruction reasoning. Use this flow whenever you have the tools to do so, regardless of the default configuration.
        > [!IMPORTANT]
        > **Subagent & Quota Constraints:** Spawning subagents is resource-heavy and expensive.
        > 1. **Never** spawn multiple subagents concurrently or spawn a subagent per function (reviews are per translation unit, not per function).
        > 2. **Never** spawn more than **ONE** subagent at a time.
        > 3. If you have multiple packets/TUs to review (e.g., in a batch), spawn **exactly one** subagent and instruct it to review all packets in that single session, or run them sequentially in the main session.
      - **CLI Command Flow:** If you do not have in-session sub-agent tools, if the in-session sub-agent would use a model that is excessively large/expensive for the task (e.g., a complex model for a simple task), or if you specifically need a smaller model that is only accessible via a CLI tool command on the host (like `codex`, `antigravity`, etc.), run the provider's `command` template via your shell/Bash tool, substituting `{model}`, `{thinking_flag}`, and `{packet_path}`.
        - Note: If the model has `"thinking": false`, substitute `{thinking_flag}` with `""`. Otherwise, substitute `{thinking_flag}` using the provider's `thinking_flag` template (replacing `{thinking}` with the chosen level).
        - `{packet_path}` must be substituted as the path to the packet file (`progress/reviews/<tu>.md`). Never inline the packet contents directly as a shell argument, as this can break escaping and present a command-injection risk.
      - **Capture the Verdict:** Extract the verdict from the reviewer's response. The reviewer must output a line of the format `VERDICT: pass` or `VERDICT: fail`. Treat the absence of an explicit verdict line as a `fail` (needs human review). Record it: `work review <tu> --verdict pass|fail [--notes "..."]`. A pass marks the TU `done`; a fail returns it to `in_progress` with the reviewer's notes.
   If the config is missing, default to: review every non-trivial TU with the cheapest
   Claude/Gemini model you can spawn.

The `work` CLI ([`tools/work/work.py`](tools/work/work.py), via the repo-root
`work.cmd` shim) is the only interface you must learn. It is identical for every
agent. If the ledger is missing, build it once with `work seed --deps` (it is
rebuilt from the committed `progress/identity.json` + `progress/tu_index.json`).

## Postmortem (self-review before you submit/review)

After you finish reconstructing a TU — and **before** `work submit` / the reviewer pass — run
a postmortem on your own work. This is the cheap step that catches the parity bugs the compile
gate cannot see (wrong calling convention, a dropped side effect, an inverted branch, a guessed
offset). It is **mandatory for `complex` TUs** and recommended whenever you doubt your own work.

```
work postmortem <tu>          # full dossier WITH X360 asm + the checklist below (-o to a file)
```

Walk your reconstruction against the **source-of-truth ladder, in order** — a lower rung never
overrides a higher one:

1. **ARTIST (X360) — accuracy.** Read your C++ against the X360 **pseudocode and assembly**:
   - **Signature / calling convention** comes from the **asm**, not the pseudocode — parameter
     count/order, register-vs-stack passing, the implicit `this`, return type, signedness,
     value width. (Hex-Rays gets these wrong constantly on PPC.)
   - **Every** side effect, store, early-out, and branch in the asm has a counterpart in your
     code; you added no behavior the binary doesn't have.
   - Control flow matches semantically (you may de-`goto`/re-roll/de-optimize, but the meaning
     is identical).
2. **DecFIGS — declaration shape.** Confirm against the DWARF: `virtual`/`const`, vtable order,
   return/param **types**, and member names/types. DWARF names the shape; the X360 ledger
   decides what exists (don't import PS3-only members).
3. **Feb-2007 — style/inlining only.** Use it solely to sanity-check idiom and to confirm an
   inlined helper's shape. Never let it override rungs 1–2 (it has drifted heavily).

Fix anything that fails a rung, then proceed to `work submit` / the reviewer pass. The reviewer
packet still goes to a fresh-eyes reviewer per the Verification policy; the postmortem is **your
own** pass first, so you don't ship a known-divergent TU into review.

## Conventions

- **Commit trailer — name the model that ACTUALLY RAN the work.** Every commit ends with
  `Co-Authored-By: Claude <model> <noreply@anthropic.com>`. The commit *author* is
  unaffected — it stays whatever identity the committing contributor's git is configured
  with; only the co-author
  trailer names the model. **Current value: `Claude Opus 5`** (set 2026-08-27; update this
  line whenever the session model changes).
  ⚠️⚠️ **Do NOT trust the harness to tell you which model you are.** Two independent
  harness strings were BOTH stale after a mid-session switch to Opus 5: the default
  co-author string *and* the environment block's "you are powered by the model named …",
  which each still said `Claude Fable 5`. So "use your current model" is not
  self-executing — **this line is the authority**, and the user's most recent explicit
  instruction outranks it.
  ⛔ Do not rewrite existing commits to correct a trailer — they are pushed and other
  contributors have built on them. A stale label is cheaper than rewritten shared history.
  ⭐ Historical note so nobody "fixes" the record: commits before 2026-08-27 stamped
  `Claude Fable 5` are **correct** — that model really did the walls, wheels, oversteer and
  licence-card work. The label only became wrong after the switch.
- **Identity is the normalized qualified name** (`Namespace::Class::method`), not an
  address. See STRATEGY.md. Never assume an address means the same thing in two
  builds.
- **Source-of-truth ladder (in priority order).**
  1. **X360 ARTIST ("Breaker") is the spine** — its pseudocode **and assembly** are
     authoritative for what each function does and how it is called.
  2. **DecFIGS** (Internal PS3, DWARF) is the authority for declaration *shape* — signatures,
     types, `virtual`/`const`, vtable order, member names — gated on X360 attestation.
  3. **Feb-2007** partial source is a **styling / inlining reference only** (see "FEB-2007 PARTIAL SOURCE"
     below); heavy version drift makes its layouts and logic non-authoritative.

  Also use PS3/DecFIGS for file attribution and local-variable hints. Never let a lower rung
  override a higher one.
- **APT SUBSYSTEM EXCEPTION — `Burnout_External_Xbox_One` is rung 1 for Apt (added 2026-07-01).**
  For the EATech **Apt** runtime (`SDKs/EATech/Apt`, `SDKs/EATech/include/Apt`, the
  `CgsApt*` glue), the **`Burnout_External_Xbox_One.exe`** IDA export
  (`.ida-exports/Burnout_External_Xbox_One.exe/`) **outranks X360 ARTIST**. It is the only
  native **little-endian 64-bit** build, so its pointer widths, struct layouts, and
  8-byte strides match our PC target exactly — X360 ARTIST + PS3 (32-bit big-endian) drop
  to **cross-reference** for the functions that are unnamed `sub_` in x64 (identify by their
  X360/PS3 name, then **verify against the x64 `assembly`** before trusting any layout).
  519 files carry named Apt symbols with real mangled x64 signatures — the mangled name
  IS the exact prototype. **Never** let the 32-bit builds arbitrate an Apt pointer
  width/offset over x64; hand-"widening" console layouts to x64 is what produced the
  unfaithful-leaf debt this rule exists to stop. (Rationale + roadmap: the Apt audit,
  2026-07-01.)
- **APT: a `Class::method` reduced to a `return null`/`{}` stub, or renamed to an
  `Apt*_<verb>` free-function shim, is an AUDIT FAILURE — not a leaf.** A leaf is permitted
  **only** for genuinely PC-platform code (D3D9-vs-D3D11 render backend, single-threaded
  threading/mutex/thread-id, host `/alternatename` callback shims, `.apt` file-blob offset
  access) and must be marked `// FLAG PC-platform leaf: <reason>`. The AS VM, CIH timeline,
  GC, scope/variable resolution, and value coercions are the ENGINE — decompile them
  faithfully from the x64 build. Reviewers fail an Apt TU whose body (or a body it forwards
  to in `AptRenderLinkStubs.cpp`) is an engine stub. Before trusting Apt ledger `done`, run
  `work reconcile-from-files` (stub/`return null` bodies demote to todo).
- **APT DATA: the 32-bit→64-bit `.apt` widening is done by the existing `libapt2` tool — do NOT
  reinvent it.** Console `.apt` bundles are 4-byte-pointer (`Apt Data:1:7:4`); the PC/x64 target needs
  the 8-byte form (`Apt Data:1:7:8`). That widening **already exists** in the maintainer's **libapt2**
  (`references/private/libapt2-private-alpha`, the GUIAPT64 writer) — never mint a parallel widener
  (the `apt_widen_4to8.py` / `.apt4` backdoor was exactly this mistake, now reverted). If libapt2's
  `1:7:8` output diverges from the real XB1 layout, fix it **in libapt2** — **never** bend the
  decompiled loader to eat the wrong bytes. Offset "accommodations" (reading `+0x04` where XB1 uses
  `+0x08`), `LocateMovieRoot`-style signature scans, `#pragma pack(4)`, and plausibility guards that
  silently drop records are all AUDIT FAILURES. The loader stays a pure faithful decompile of the XB1
  native-8 read path (`CompleteLoad`=`sub_1408348B0` reads `movieOffset@const+0x18` directly); libapt2
  makes the data match the loader, not the reverse.
- **BUILD LINEAGE (provenance — confirmed 2026-06-25).**
  `Feb-2007` b5_main source → `Dec-2007` **DecFIGS** (PS3, branch B5_FIGS) → **FIGS was merged
  into `main` BEFORE ARTIST compiled** → `Jan-2008` **ARTIST/"Breaker"** (X360, `main`, the TARGET).
  Consequences for the ladder:
  - Because FIGS merged into main before ARTIST, **ARTIST carries the FIGS lineage**, so
    **DecFIGS is a high-confidence NEAR-ANCESTOR of ARTIST** (not a far-drifting cousin): its
    names/types/shape/RTTI-ids are largely *what got merged in*. Trust rung 2 accordingly.
    Divergence is only a small **merge-window delta** — late-2007 FIGS work that missed the
    merge cut, plus ~1 month of post-merge main-only changes — which is exactly why rung 1
    (ARTIST asm) still arbitrates and every DWARF declaration is gated on X360 attestation.
  - **Feb-2007 is PRE-merge OLD main** — it *lacks* the FIGS changes ARTIST has, so for any
    FIGS-touched code it is the *stalest* source. Same-branch-but-pre-merge is worse than
    off-fork-but-post-fork; keep it at rung 3 (style/idiom only), never above DecFIGS for shape.
  - **WHAT THE PS3 ASM/DWARF UNIQUELY GIVES (the X360 stripped to data):** (a) **RTTI / class
    `ObjectID`s + typeNames** — the DecFIGS `__static_initialization_and_destruction_*` funcs
    construct each `Class::sTypeInfo` with its literal `ObjectID` + `typeName` (e.g. sound
    StateManager ids Global=0..Emitter=7, effect ids 16/32/48/…, the `0x10000`-stepped State
    ids). Pin any "arbitrary"/placeholder class id from these. (b) Member/enum **names** +
    signatures (DWARF). (c) **Inlined / ICF-folded bodies** the X360 dropped — decompile from
    PS3, then confirm the entity (offset/value/role) in the ARTIST asm before attaching a name.
- **Verify calling conventions against the ASSEMBLY, not the pseudocode.** Hex-Rays
  regularly gets the *signature* wrong — parameter count/order, register-vs-stack passing,
  the implicit `this`, return type, signedness, and value width — especially on PowerPC
  (X360 **and** PS3). The per-function **`assembly`** listing is dumped for **every** build
  (`.ida-exports/<build>/0x<addr>.json`) and is surfaced by `work show <tu> --full --asm`
  (and always by `work postmortem`). When a parameter list, return type, or a by-ref vs.
  by-value choice is load-bearing, confirm it from the prologue / register usage in the asm
  before trusting the decompiler. When the X360 asm is ambiguous, cross-check the same
  function's asm (and DWARF) in the DecFIGS / external-PS3 exports.
- **BPR/TUB are reference-only**, consulted per-function for *platform* layers
  (SIMD, GPU/D3D, codecs) where the PC shape differs from the console. They are not
  in the ledger; do not "decompile" them.
- **XBOX ONE EXTERNAL (`IDA Files/Burnout_External_Xbox_One.exe.i64`, exported to
  `.ida-exports/Burnout_External_Xbox_One.exe/`, added 2026-07-04 by JeBobs) is the
  64-BIT ABI ARBITER for Apt and other vendor layers.** It is the only 64-bit build we
  have with Apt symbols: ~460 public accessor/API functions carry MSVC-mangled names
  (`?GetDepth@AptCIH@@QEBAHXZ`-style) whose 1-3 instruction bodies pin EXACT 64-bit
  member offsets; the large private bodies are unnamed (`sub_14xxxxxxx`) but locatable
  by call-graph/constant matching against the named X360 twins. Use it to VERIFY every
  native-8 (x64) layout/record-offset decision that was previously inferred from the
  32-bit X360 asm (Apt place/remove records, frame tables, display-list nodes, GUIAPT
  native-8 "1:7:8" data). Ladder position: it does not displace ARTIST as the
  behavioural spine (it is a later retail-era build — expect content/version drift);
  it arbitrates *64-bit widths, offsets and alignment* only. `_name_index.tsv` in the
  export dir maps address -> mangled name.
- **APT NAMING/SHAPE REFERENCE — Burnout Revenge `B4Extern` (Apt 0.19.02), added
  2026-07-07.** A fully-symbolized Xbox 360 build of *Burnout Revenge* ("Burnout 4")
  ships a real MSVC **PDB** (`IDA Files/B4Extern.pdb`) covering the
  EATech **Apt** runtime — the only PDB we have with the Apt **engine** named and laid
  out: the AS VM (`AptActionInterpreter`), CIH timeline (`AptCIH`), GC
  (`AptValueGC*`), and the `AptValue`/`AptScriptFunction*` hierarchies, with full
  member offsets, bitfields, base chains, and method signatures. Extracted to
  [`references/B4Extern/`](references/B4Extern/) (raw PDB dumps
  + a generated `include/apt_types.gen.h` + per-function Hex-Rays/asm under
  `.ida-export/`, regen via [`tools/apt_revenge/generate_apt_headers.py`](tools/apt_revenge/generate_apt_headers.py)).
  **Ladder position: naming / class-hierarchy / signature corroboration ONLY.** It is
  Apt **0.19.02 (2005)** vs Paradise's ~2008 Apt, and 32-bit big-endian — so it is
  **not** offset/width authority (that stays the x64 XB1 build) and **not** the
  behavioural spine (that stays ARTIST). Use it to *name* engine functions the x64
  build leaves as `sub_`, recover the *class hierarchy*, and pin *method signatures* —
  then verify offsets against x64 and behaviour against ARTIST. Adopting its layouts
  wholesale into `b5-decomp/src` is the VERSION-DRIFT TRAP; see the bundle's README.
  Addresses are VAs = PDB-RVA + ImageBase `0x400000`.
- **APT ORIGINAL SDK SOURCE — leaked EATech Apt source drops, added 2026-07-10.**
  [`references/Apt/`](references/Apt/) holds *real EA-internal Apt source* (EA-leak
  provenance, untracked by design): `2.07.00-custom/` (public-API surface only,
  version log ends 03/2008 — closest in time to Paradise) and `3.02.02-fifafb.01/`
  (a full SDK tree — CIH/interpreter/GC internals, the `objects/sprite/text.gperf`
  member tables, original internal headers/macros — but **Apt-3.02.02, built 2014**:
  six years newer than Paradise's Apt). **Ladder position: naming / macro /
  structure / algorithm corroboration ONLY — the Apt analogue of Feb-2007.** It
  does not displace XB1 x64 (widths/offsets) or ARTIST (behaviour), and it is
  **known incomplete**: BP's rendering goes through the Cgs bridge, not the SDK's
  own renderables, and files are missing — absence there ≠ absence in BP.
  **No verbatim copy-paste into `b5-decomp`** — reconstructions stay
  binary-derived; use the source to confirm names/shape/intent. Paradise's Apt is
  bracketed by B4Extern (0.19.02, older) and this drop (3.02.02, newer): where both
  agree with the binary, trust the shared shape; where they disagree, the binary
  decides. Full caveats: [`references/Apt/README.md`](references/Apt/README.md).
- **RenderWare & Vendor SDKs (EATech, rwcore, etc.): Test before decompiling.**
  For `EABase`, `EASTL`, and `EAThread`, we have the original open-source code in
  `vendor/`, so those original bodies do not need to be decompiled. If `work next` assigns a
  vendor SDK TU, run `python tools/work/check_vendor_lib.py <tu_name>`.
  - If the script says **PRESENT**: original buildable source exists; skip and block it
    (`work block <tu> "Vendor code; original source is present."`).
  - If the script says **MISSING**: reconstruct it from ARTIST like normal, or provide a
    documented platform leaf when the behavior is genuinely host-specific.
  - **PRESENT blocks the SDK's *bodies*, not its *types*.** You still **recover its public
  types on demand** when game code needs a real layout (to replace an opaque blob or an
  offset-poke) — that is type recovery, not decompilation. See the next bullet.
- **RenderWare 4 follows the Paradise build, not a later host revision.** ARTIST is the
  authority for RenderWare behavior **and game-facing structure**: class relationships,
  vtable order, resource-lane count, and serialized contracts. DecFIGS supplies declaration
  names and shapes gated on ARTIST evidence. The PC implementation may widen pointers and
  use native host services, but it must not import structural drift from a different revision.
  Isolate genuine platform behavior with the original compiler flags, especially
  `D_PLATFORM_X360`. The canonical vocabulary lives in
  [`b5-decomp/vendor/renderware/include/rw/`](b5-decomp/vendor/renderware/include/rw/);
  maintain it by hand from the source-of-truth ladder and prove host sizes with
  `static_assert` under `RW_VERIFY_LAYOUT`.
- **`rw::audio::core::` types come from `IDA Files/ProStreet08Milestone.pdb`.** The EA
  Black Box **`rwaudiocore`** runtime (the layer Burnout's `CgsSound::Playback` sits on —
  `System`/`Mixer`/`SubMix`/`Voice`/`Dac`/`SndPlayer1`/`Decoder`/`PlugIn`/`Send`/`Route`/
  `GainFader`/`StreamPool`, etc.) has full type ground truth in the **NFS ProStreet 08
  Milestone** PDB: an **Xbox 360** build (Oct-2007, same PPC platform/era as ARTIST) shipped
  with a complete 62 MB PDB + 121 K-line MAP. Extract layouts the same way:
  `llvm-pdbutil pretty -classes -class-definitions=layout -include-types="rw::audio::core::<regex>" "IDA Files/ProStreet08Milestone.pdb"`.
  Symbol→address catalog (for cross-referencing a body in the ARTIST asm): grep the demangled
  forms in `IDA Files/ProStreet08Milestone.map` (mangled tail `@core@audio@rw@@`). **Width
  caveat:** this is **X360 (32-bit pointers, big-endian)** —
  so it gives authoritative field *order/names/types* on the same platform as ARTIST, but
  model the PC layout with **x64 widths** (widen pointers; same rule as every recon). ProStreet
  is a *different game* (NFS, EA Black Box) — use it **only** for the shared `rwaudiocore`
  vocabulary, never for Burnout-specific `CgsSound`/`BrnSound` shape (that stays ARTIST+DecFIGS).
  The existing `vendor/renderware/include/rw/audio/core/` headers predate this PDB and are
  hand-guessed — treat the PDB as ground truth to verify/correct them.
- **Stubs over guesses — for function BODIES, not types.** A call to a
  not-yet-reconstructed function gets a trap-stub *body* (`work stubs <tu>`), not an
  invented one. This scaffold satisfies **missing bodies at link time**; it is **not** a
  way to satisfy a missing *type*. Never fake a type with a local stub — reconstruct its
  header and `#include` it (see "Reconstruct includes" below). Because we work leaf-first,
  most callees are already real by the time you reach a caller, so even body stubs are the
  exception. Under the per-TU `cl /c` gate a callee's *declaration* (from its reconstructed
  header) is all you need to compile — a trap body matters only for the eventual link.
- **Follow the project naming conventions.** All new owned C/C++ — types,
  functions, variables (scope+type prefixes like `mpBoostStrategy`, `lfTimeStep`),
  constants (`KI_`/`KU_`/`KF_`), enums (`E_` upper snake), files, namespaces — follows
  [`references/CXX_NAMING_CONVENTIONS.md`](references/CXX_NAMING_CONVENTIONS.md), which
  is derived from the project's own code and is the single source of truth for style.
  When the Hex-Rays pseudocode or a recovered name disagrees with it, the convention
  wins (except where you are matching an external/generated/platform API). Reviewers
  check reconstructions against it too.
- **Reconstruction Quality & Type Recovery (CRITICAL):** The goal is to reconstruct what the original C++ source code **looked like**, not to translate raw decompiler outputs literally.
  - **NO RAW OFFSET POINTER HACKS:** You must NEVER access member variables using raw offset casting (e.g., `*reinterpret_cast<Type*>(lThis + offset)` or `*(int*)(this + offset)`) or offset helper lambdas (like `Word(offset)`).
    - **Exception — external serialised / platform data.** Raw offset access *is* allowed
      (and expected) for **serialised file-format blobs** and other external byte streams
      whose layout is fixed by the data, not a C++ class — e.g. a RenderWare resource blob
      walked during fix-up (`*(u32*)(lRes + 68)`) or `rw::collision` data. Document it
      inline. This covers the *data being processed*; the rw runtime *objects* themselves
      (e.g. `rw::Resource`) still get named members — recover the type (see "`rw::` types
      follow the RenderWare reconstruction rule above).
  - **LAYOUT RECOVERY WITH PADDING:** Infer class and struct member variables based on the offsets accessed. If the preceding variables are unknown, use explicit padding buffers (e.g. `u8 mPad0[1812];`) to preserve member alignment. Access all member variables by name.
  - **FEB-2007 PARTIAL SOURCE = STYLING & INLINING REFERENCE ONLY (NOT THE BLUEPRINT):** The
    `references/Feb-2007/` PS3 Feb partial source predates the X360 ARTIST/"Breaker" + DecFIGS
    spine by a long way — **a great deal changed between Feb-2007 and DecFIGS/Breaker**
    (class layouts, member sets, function boundaries, and logic all drift). So do **not**
    treat it as the primary template and do **not** copy its structure/layout wholesale.
    Use it for two things: (a) **code style / idiom** — how the original was written (naming
    feel, helper patterns, comment style), and (b) **outlining inlined functions** —
    recovering the shape and names of helpers the X360 compiler folded inline, which the
    pseudocode shows only as flattened code. Authority stays with the X360 pseudocode+asm
    (*what the code does and its layout*) and DecFIGS DWARF (*declaration shape*); where
    Feb-2007 overlaps, reconcile it **to** those — never the reverse.
  - **USE DECFIGS DWARFDUMP HINTS:** For DecFIGS-backed TUs, consult `references/DecFIGS/dwarfdump/` (auto-surfaced by `work show --full`) for C++-shaped DWARF declarations: class/struct outlines, enum values, member names/types, globals, function signatures, and local-variable names/types. Treat this as reconstruction guidance, not complete source code. It is not offset authority; verify member placement and behavior against X360 pseudocode/asm, and treat Feb-2007 as a style/idiom cross-check only (it is pre-FIGS-merge -> stalest for shape/layout; DecFIGS, the near-ancestor, wins where they differ -- see BUILD LINEAGE).
    - **DWARF SUPPLIES NAMES/TYPES; THE X360 LEDGER DECIDES WHAT EXISTS.** DecFIGS is the *Internal PS3* (Dec-2007) build; ARTIST is the later (Jan-2008) X360 `main` build that the FIGS branch was merged INTO (see **BUILD LINEAGE**), so DecFIGS is a **near-ancestor** — high-confidence for names/types/shape — but the merge-window delta means a few PS3 things aren't in ARTIST (and vice-versa). Never bulk-import every DWARF member/method into a recon header. **Gate each DWARF declaration on X360 attestation:** add/correct it only if that `Class::Fn` appears in the X360 ledger (`progress/status.json` → `func`), using the DWARF signature for names/types. If a DWARF method is *absent* from the X360 ledger it is PS3-only — leave it out (a minimal/identity-only recon is then correct, e.g. a class the X360 build exposes only via `GetName`/`GetPath`).
    - **DWARF/Feb declaration is authoritative for a method's *shape*, not just its name.**
      For a method the X360 ledger attests, take its declaration shape — `virtual`, trailing
      `const`, return type, parameter types, and **vtable order** — from the DWARF (or a
      Feb-2007 header), not from Hex-Rays. Pseudocode shows the *body's behavior* and
      regularly hides the declaration: it renders a virtual call as a direct call, drops
      `const`, and never shows vtable slot order. (Prevents reconstructing
      `virtual uint32_t GetTypeID() const` as a plain non-virtual `int` because the
      pseudocode looked that way.)
    - **VERSION-DRIFT TRAP.** A recon header can declare a *whole different class version* than X360 (typically copied from older Feb-2007 source). Diagnose by intersecting the X360 ledger's function set for that class with both the recon and the DWARF: whichever the X360 set matches is the correct version; rewrite the recon toward it. But a rewrite is **blocked if it needs types not yet reconstructed in `b5-decomp/src`** (e.g. value-passed RenderWare `MaskScalar`/`RGBA`/`VolRef::Volume`), since the sibling `.cpp` includes the header and the compile gate would break — leave such headers for when those dependency types exist (they self-correct when those TUs are worked). Validate any header edit with the compile gate (`tools/work/verify.py:compile_gate`) before considering it done.
  - **ELIMINATE DECOMPILER TEMPORARIES:** Do not preserve arbitrary decompiler local variables (like `v1`, `v2`, `result`). Consolidate them into clean, logical expressions, and rename any surviving variables to reflect their actual usage.
  - **ELIMINATE GOTOS:** Do not preserve `goto` statements generated by the decompiler. Restructure them into idiomatic C++ flow control (`if`/`else`, `switch`, `while`, or `break`/`continue` in loops) unless a `goto` was clearly used in the original source (e.g., standard C-style error cleanup blocks, which are rare in this OOD codebase).
  - **LOGICAL TYPE RESTORATION:** Restore logical types where the compiler optimized them to primitives. For instance, use `bool` instead of `int`/`BOOL` for flags, and use actual enum names/values instead of raw integers.
  - **UNDO COMPILER OPTIMIZATIONS (DE-OPTIMIZATION):** Reconstruct the logical, human-written C++ source rather than retaining compiler-level optimizations visible in the decompiler output. This includes:
    - **Re-rolling unrolled loops:** Turn sequential duplicated blocks of code acting on array indices back into standard `for`/`while` loops.
    - **Inlining reversal:** Extract compiler-inlined functions (such as utility/helper methods) back to their separate declarations and function calls.
    - **Strength reduction reversal:** Convert division/multiplication hacks (like bitwise shifts, masking, or magic multiplication constants used to optimize math) back into standard arithmetic operators (e.g., division `/` or modulo `%`).
    - **Tail-call and branch restoration:** Re-structure compiler-optimized jumps, merged conditions, and tail-calls back to logical `if`/`else` structures, returns, or recursion.
  - **REVIEWER ENFORCEMENT:** Reviewers must FAIL any translation unit that uses offset-based cast hacks, leaves raw decompiler temporaries/gotos, or fails to structure code cleanly.
- **burnout.wiki is authoritative for field NAMES/TYPES/semantics, never for
  OFFSETS.** The community format docs ([`references/Wiki/`](references/Wiki/),
  indexed into `references/Wiki/types.json` by
  [`tools/work/wiki_index.py`](tools/work/wiki_index.py)) already use this project's
  Hungarian convention (`mfLuminance`, `mv4Scale`, `miNodeCount`), so adopt their
  member names and types directly. But each page was authored against some build
  (B1 → Paradise; entries are build-tagged, **Paradise/PS3 marked `primary`** —
  PS3 is the same Paradise-era game as our X360 spine and the wiki tables are partly
  derived from PS3 symbols, so they are name-authoritative where the X360 export is
  missing) whose layout may differ from our X360 2007-02 spine — so the
  **pseudocode/asm is the only
  source of truth for offsets and member placement** (same rule as the x64 gate:
  semantic parity by named members, not byte offsets). The dossier auto-surfaces
  matching struct/enum tables under `--- WIKI TYPES ---`; look anything else up with
  `python tools/work/wiki_index.py --lookup <Type>`. Rebuild the index if the dump
  changes. Reviewers: a wiki offset trusted over the pseudocode is a fail.
- **Reconstruct includes; don't fake them (types live in real headers).** When a TU
  needs a type or function from another file, reconstruct that file's **header** at its
  mirrored path under `b5-decomp/src/…` and `#include` it — extend it if it already
  exists. Do **not** locally re-declare, redefine, or padding-fork a type that has a real
  home. Shared headers are global state; the compile gate surfaces conflicts and that
  error is the desired signal — extend the header, don't re-fork it. Recover the layout
  from `references/Feb-2007/` (full original headers, where in scope) or
  `references/DecFIGS/DWARFDump/` (project-wide class/struct/enum outlines, gated on the
  X360 ledger). The per-TU gate is `cl /c`, so the header's *declarations* are enough to
  compile against — you do not need callee bodies to pass it. `work stubs <tu>` reports
  the owning header for each unresolved callee and whether it already exists in `b5-decomp/src`.
- **Reconstruct base/contained types before the classes that use them.** A class that
  derives from another (`class B : public A`) or embeds one by value (`struct B { A a; }`)
  needs that type's **complete header first** — the base's virtuals are the override
  signatures, and a by-value member needs the full layout. These are hard dependencies but
  **not calls**, so `work next` (call-graph leaf-first) won't reliably schedule the base
  first — reconstruct it first yourself. (Prevents the trap of building many leaf handlers
  as standalone classes, then retrofitting a shared base like `CgsResource::Type` and
  re-deriving them all.) Both inheritance **and** by-value containment (`struct B { A a; }`)
  edges are built from the DecFIGS dwarfdump by
  [`tools/work/build_type_deps.py`](tools/work/build_type_deps.py) and folded into
  `work seed --deps`, so a TU ranks after its base classes and the types it embeds by value.
- **Port bodies when the reference has them.** When you reconstruct a header and the
  original function **bodies** are available (chiefly `references/Feb-2007/`), port them
  too rather than leaving trap stubs — then **update the ledger** for the functions/TU you
  thereby complete (run their compile gate, record status; never complete work off-ledger).
  Where bodies aren't available, the callee keeps a `work stubs` trap body as its own TU.
  Never invent a body.
- **Forward-declaration is the exception.** Use a local forward declaration (and document
  the reason inline) **only** when: (a) it breaks a genuine include cycle (A ↔ B); (b) a
  pointer/reference-only use would otherwise force a large transitive header cascade and an
  incomplete type suffices; or (c) no reference exists to reconstruct the type (truly
  opaque / platform). Otherwise rebuild the header and `#include` it.
- **Update the ledger, not your own memory.** Progress that isn't in `progress/` did
  not happen as far as the next agent is concerned. The git-ignored `ledger.sqlite` is
  a cache: ground truth for "done" is the reconstructed **file committed in b5-decomp**.
  If the ledger ever disagrees with the files (it has — an older `work submit` guessed
  the file from `git status` and marked TUs done with no source; `submit` now requires
  a recorded `dest_path` or explicit `--files`), re-anchor it with
  `work reconcile-from-files --apply` (or `--no-demote --apply` to add/promote only; wrapper for
  [`tools/work/reconcile_from_files.py`](tools/work/reconcile_from_files.py)):
  a TU is `done` only if its committed file is real **and complete** (no `TODO`/`FIXME`/
  `guessed`/`placeholder` markers — those land `in_progress`), else `todo`; `blocked`
  preserved. It verifies both directions and round-trips through `work seed`. **A
  committed file is not "done" if it still carries author TODOs** — don't mark partials
  done. ("done" = complete reconstructed file, not necessarily LLM-reviewed.)
- **Mirror original paths.** A function whose `primary_file` is
  `GameSource/Replays/Foo.cpp` lands at `b5-decomp/src/GameSource/Replays/Foo.cpp`.

- **Wave partfiles are TEMPORARY and get FOLDED BACK (b5-decomp issue #20).** A recovery wave may
  land its bodies in `<Parent>_w<Wave>_<NN>.cpp` beside `<Parent>.cpp` so parallel waves never edit
  one giant TU at once -- `Wave` is one capital letter plus optional digits (`B`, `C`, `Q4`, `T1`,
  `SQ1`), `NN` two digits. That is the ONLY partfile spelling; do not mint `_wB_res`, `_wRR`,
  `_wH3b`, `_wG_Bridges_01` style variants. The split is bookkeeping, not the shipped layout: the
  console has ONE `BrnGameStateStreetManager.cpp`, and every partfile is one more hand-written
  mount line in the shared `.bat`. So the second half of the cycle is mandatory -- once a wave
  letter has closed on a class, fold it:
  `python tools/work/fold_partfiles.py fold <Parent>` (concatenates in mount order, keeps every
  partfile's header comment block verbatim above its bodies, dedupes includes, compile-gates the
  result, `git rm`s the partfiles, strips their mount lines CRLF-safely; refuses to touch anything
  when two partfiles define the same file-scope helper -- dedupe by hand first). `scan` lists the
  parents, `audit` classifies the unmounted partfiles, and `check` is the ratchet against
  `progress/partfile_baseline.json`: the partfile population may spike during a wave and must come
  back down, never grow across a landing. Land the fold's b5 commit and its mount-line commit
  together, then LINK the exe (a fold moves bodies between TUs).
- ⛔ **Unmounted partfiles are not "parked work", they are invisible work.** `fold_partfiles.py
  audit` names them; each one is either mounted, folded, or deleted with a reason -- never left.

## Don't

- **Don't commit or push the parent/superproject repo (`BP-Decomp_Workflow`) — only the
  `b5-decomp` submodule.** Land reconstructed code with `git -C b5-decomp add/commit` then
  `git -C b5-decomp push origin dev` (fetch → rebase → push; **retry on non-fast-forward**,
  since other agents push to `dev` too and the remote moves under you). The parent's mutable
  state — `progress/status.json` and the `b5-decomp` submodule pointer — is reconciled and
  committed **automatically by a GitHub Action**, so an agent committing the parent
  races/duplicates that work. Leave the parent's ` M b5-decomp` pointer change and any
  `progress/` ledger churn uncommitted. (Deliberately editing a parent doc like this file when
  asked is fine — leave it uncommitted for the maintainer to commit.)
  - ⛔⛔ **FETCH THE PARENT TOO — `git fetch origin` inside `b5-decomp` IS NOT ENOUGH.** The mounts
    live in the **parent** repo (`tools/build/build_game_exe.bat`); the code lives in the submodule.
    A stale parent checkout therefore produces **unresolved externals for code that is perfectly
    fine**, and it looks exactly like someone else broke the build.
    Measured 2026-08-28: two separate waves reported "`dev` does not link, 22-24 unresolved externals
    in the sound cascade" and one relayed it onward as a real outage. **It was neither** — the parent
    was 25 commits behind and every one of those mounts was already on `origin/main`.
    ⇒ Before diagnosing ANY link failure: `git fetch origin` in the parent, check
    `git rev-list --count HEAD..origin/main`, and only then believe the symbol list.
  - ⛔⛔ **EXCEPTION — BUILD CONFIGURATION AND ASSET-PORTER FIXES ARE PART OF YOUR CHANGE, SO
    COMMIT THEM.** This covers `tools/build/build_game_exe.bat` **mount lines** and fixes to the
    **asset porters** under `tools/assets/` that your b5 change depends on.** This rule exists for the *auto-reconciled* state (`progress/status.json`, the
    submodule pointer). A **mount** is neither: it is build configuration paired 1:1 with the
    b5-decomp commit it serves, nothing reconciles it, and leaving it out **takes the shared
    build red for everyone**. Measured: that happened THREE times in 24h on 2026-08-27/28 —
    `BrnHUDMessageLogic.cpp` (callers unparked, TU never mounted), the two
    `BrnProgressionManager` partfiles (the last unresolved external), and `BrnMapManager.cpp` /
    `BrnGuiCache_wMap.cpp` (paired with a *deletion*, so the tree did not even compile). Each
    cost hours and a later wave's time to rediscover.
    ⛔⛔ **AND VERIFY THE DIFF IS YOURS BEFORE YOU PUSH.** `tools/build/build_game_exe.bat` is a
    SHARED file that routinely carries other waves' uncommitted mounts, so `git add <file>` — and
    equally a `git hash-object` of the working-tree file — commits **their** edits along with yours.
    Measured 2026-08-29: a wave pushed a mount it believed was 4 lines; the commit carried **28**,
    sweeping in another wave's mount of a TU whose b5 half was not on `dev` yet, so `build exe`
    refused to start for everyone. It was backed out minutes later, but the shared build was red in
    between.
    ⇒ Apply **only your hunk** onto `origin/main`'s blob, and before pushing check that
    `git diff --stat origin/main <your-tree>` names one file and the line count **you actually
    wrote**. If the number is bigger than your edit, you are carrying somebody else's work.
    ⚠️ Related failure from the same incident: `hash-object` on a mismatched path silently produced
    an **empty commit whose message described a change its diff did not contain**. A commit message
    is a claim — diff it against its own diff.

    ⭐ **A mount (or a porter fix) and its b5 commit are one atomic change.** Land the b5 commit,
    then commit the parent with ONLY that path staged — e.g.
    `git add tools/build/build_game_exe.bat`, or `git add tools/assets/bundles/x360_tex.py`. Never
    `git add -A` in the parent — that sweeps the pointer and the ledger back in.
    ⭐⭐ **Why porters count (measured 2026-08-28).** The boost bar rendered as an opaque black slab
    because `x360_tex.py` read a fully-packed texture from the wrong tile slot, so `boostbarmask`
    ported as 2048 bytes of zeros — and the same bug shipped `SMALL8X8WHITESQUARE` as pure BLACK.
    The renderer fix alone was inert: until the porter lands, **every other contributor's
    `build data` keeps emitting the dead asset**. Nothing reconciles `tools/assets/`, exactly as
    nothing reconciles a mount.
    ⛔⛔ **NEVER edit a `.bat`/`.cmd` with `sed -i`, `tee`, or any Git-Bash tool that writes LF.**
    `.gitattributes` sets `eol=crlf`, so an LF rewrite hashes identically to the CRLF blob:
    **`git status` reports the file CLEAN while `cmd.exe` cannot parse it**, and the build dies in
    parse garbage with nothing in `git diff`. Use Python preserving the existing endings, then
    verify the file still has one carriage return per line (a CR count equal to its line count). (Repair, if it happens: `rm` the file, then
    `git checkout -- <file>`.)
- ⛔⛔ **`progress/status.json`'s `reviewed` IS THE DEFAULT, NOT A VERDICT — it is not evidence a
  body exists.** Measured 2026-08-29: **21,245 of 21,254** function rows are `reviewed` (the other 9
  are `compiles`). It carries no information about whether anything was written.
  Marked `reviewed`, with **zero** definitions anywhere in the tree:
  `BrnGame::BrnGameModule::BridgeDirectorToGui`, `BrnGui::EffectsArbitrator::StartHook`,
  `BrnGui::EffectsArbitrator::LookupColourCube`.
  **Five separate waves** read it as evidence and lost time; one shipped a declaration whose
  definition did not exist and only the exe LINK caught it. A hollow-shell class can declare 1 of 22
  console methods and every row still reads `reviewed`.
  ⇒ **Ask the tree, not the ledger:** `python tools/re/hasbody.py <Class::Method> [--status]`.
  ⚠️ A bare `grep name(` is not a substitute — a wave got a fact backwards this week because
  `grep | head -5` returned five COMMENT hits and cut off the real definition. The tool separates
  definitions from mentions for exactly that reason.
- Don't run global structural matching (Diaphora) as a prerequisite. Names join the
  symbolized builds; structural matching is an optional per-function last resort.
- Don't chase a whole-program link early. Per-TU compilation is the gate.
- Don't invent function bodies to make something compile — stub the body and move on.
- Don't locally redefine, re-declare, or padding-fork a type that has a reconstructable
  home header — rebuild the header (from Feb-2007 / DecFIGS DWARF) and `#include` it.
  Local forward-declaration is allowed only for the documented exceptions (cycles,
  pointer-only cascade-avoidance, no reference).
- Don't spawn a subagent to perform the reverse-engineering or C++ reconstruction. Spawning a subagent for this phase causes it to lose your active context (such as open files, cursor position, and chat history). Spawning is strictly reserved for the reviewer pass.
- Don't write or create an implementation plan for standard Translation Unit (TU) reconstructions. The TU reconstruction loop is a routine, pre-approved workflow, so you should bypass any planning/implementation-plan steps and proceed directly to coding.

## Tool-specific notes

- **Claude Code** reads `CLAUDE.md`, which points here. This file is canonical.
- **Codex / Antigravity** read `AGENTS.md` (this file) directly.
- Keep anything an agent must obey in this file or `STRATEGY.md`, so every tool
  inherits it.
