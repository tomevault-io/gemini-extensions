# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository layout

Two deployables plus a shell-script test battery at the root:

- `alarik/` — the Swift (6.2, Vapor) server: S3 API, internal API, clustering. This is the SwiftPM package root.
- `console/` — Nuxt 4 SPA admin/object-browser console (`@nuxt/ui`), talks to the server's `/api/v1`.
- `*_tests.sh` at repo root — end-to-end suites that drive real server processes with `aws`, `rclone`, `mc`, and raw `curl`.
- `charts/alarik/` — Helm chart. `publish.sh` builds/pushes images and rewrites the version in `Sources/Global/Constants.swift`, `console/nuxt.config.ts`, and the chart's `appVersion` from `VERSION`.

## Commands

Swift package (run from `alarik/`):

```bash
swift build                                  # debug build -> .build/debug/Alarik
swift test --no-parallel                     # full unit suite (same as ./test.sh)
swift test --no-parallel --filter "S3ControllerTests"   # single suite
```

**Always pass `--no-parallel`.** Tests share on-disk state (`Storage/buckets`, `Storage/multipart`) process-wide, so parallel runs interfere. This holds for filtered runs too. CI (`.github/workflows/swift.yml`, macOS) runs exactly this.

Requires `isa-l` for the `CISAL` system library target: `brew install isa-l` (macOS) / `libisal-dev` (Debian).

End-to-end suites (run from repo root; each needs a `swift build` first and port 8080 free):

```bash
./run_all_tests.sh        # everything, ~20 min: unit + aws + rclone + mc + replication + cluster
bash aws_cli_tests.sh     # needs a server already running on :8080
./replication_tests.sh    # starts its own 2 instances (:8081/:8082)
./cluster_tests.sh        # starts its own 4 instances (:8091+), k=2/m=2
```

`run_all_tests.sh` starts each S3 suite against a freshly built binary in a temp state dir, so it never touches the repo's `Storage/`. Preflight requires `swift aws rclone mc jq`.

Running a server by hand:

```bash
cd alarik && JWT=test-secret ./.build/debug/Alarik serve --hostname 127.0.0.1 --port 8080
```

The process resolves `Storage/` relative to its cwd — run it from a scratch directory to get clean state.

Console: `cd console && npm run dev` (`:3000`). Whole stack in Docker: `./start_dev.sh` (server + console with hot reload), `./start_cluster.sh` (multi-node cluster compose).

### Debug vs release

Some bugs are release-only (optimizer-exposed; e.g. the ISA-L use-after-free in `ReedSolomonEngine`, #24). `swift test -c release` does not work here (the executable's `@main` collides with the test runner); reproduce release bugs by running a real multi-node cluster from `.build/release/Alarik`. Note that `#if DEBUG` seeds a fixed `alarik`/`alarik` admin and the `AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE` key — release seeds neither, so set `ADMIN_USERNAME`/`ADMIN_PASSWORD` and `DEFAULT_ACCESS_KEY`/`DEFAULT_SECRET_KEY`.

## Architecture

### No database — anywhere

There is no SQL/embedded DB. All control-plane metadata (users, buckets, access keys, policies, OIDC providers, outbox tasks, and cluster membership itself) lives in Alarik's own storage engine under the reserved pseudo-bucket `.alarik.sys` (`MetadataNamespace`), erasure-coded exactly like object data. `Storage/` is the only thing to back up. This is why rebalancing and bit-rot scrubbing cover metadata for free.

`MetadataStore` is the byte-oriented K/V layer over that: reads run locally from any node (gather-and-decode is idempotent), writes/CAS forward to the rank-0 owner so placements can't race. `MetadataListingService` fans out across nodes for listings; `localRecords` deliberately avoids fan-out for periodic sweeps (`O(nodes²)` upkeep traffic otherwise).

### Request path

`routes.swift` registers, in order: health probes (`/livez`, `/readyz`), `/api/v1/*` (console/internal API, mostly behind `InternalAuthenticator`), top-level node-to-node cluster controllers (behind the cluster-secret middleware), and finally `S3Controller`, which claims `:bucketName` + `**` catch-alls. Ordering matters — a bucket may not be named after a constant top-level path (`MetadataNamespace.reservedRootPaths`).

Every S3 object handler follows the same shape: authenticate → extract bucket/key → `ObjectRoutingService.routingDecision` (before touching `req.body`, since `.forward` streams it onward untouched) → serve locally or proxy to a responsible node. Multipart operations use `multipartRoutingDecision` instead, which pins to rank-0, because in-flight part state exists on only one node.

### Clustering

Opt-in: a node clusters only when both `CLUSTER_NODE_ADDRESS` and `CLUSTER_SECRET` are set; membership bootstraps from `CLUSTER_SEED_NODES`. Config is validated unconditionally at boot so typos fail fast.

- `PlacementService` — rendezvous (HRW) hashing, pure functions of `(bucket, key, activeNodes)`; unit-testable with no cluster. Top-3 is always a prefix of top-`k+m`, so rank-0 is primary in both views.
- `Services/ErasureCoding/*` — Reed-Solomon `k+m` via ISA-L (`CISAL`). Write/read/delete coordinators, rebalance on membership change, and a bit-rot scrubber. Defaults `k=4`/`m=2` (needs ≥6 nodes; `cluster_tests.sh` overrides to 2/2 for its 4 nodes).
- Four outbox dispatchers (webhooks, bucket replication, cluster replication, EC shard repair) all sit on `GenericOutboxDispatcher` + `OutboxMailbox`. Tasks are plain files at `Storage/outbox/<collection>/<ownerNodeId>/<taskId>.task` — node-affine, so discovery is a local `readdir`, not a cluster scan. Each has a 2s tick in `configure.swift` purely to pick up elapsed backoffs; fresh work is woken explicitly.
- Boot ordering in `configure.swift` is load-bearing and documented inline (membership before cache load; `isDesignatedSeeder` elects one seeder statically, before any network call, to avoid N split-brain admin accounts).

### Storage layer (`Sources/IO/`)

- `ObjectFileHandler` — non-EC objects as a single `.obj` file: 4-byte big-endian JSON length + `ObjectMeta` header + payload. Versions live in a sibling `<key>.versions/<versionId>.obj` directory.
- `ErasureCodedObjectHandler` — the `.ecshard` counterpart; each shard file self-describes (full `ObjectMeta` in its header) so rank-0 can answer from shard 0 alone.
- `AtomicObjectWriter` — temp file + rename + fsync of file *and* directory (skippable via `ALARIK_FSYNC=false`).
- Payloads above `Constants.streamingThreshold` (4 MiB) stream through `Storage/spool/`; EC encode scratch is `Storage/ecscratch/`. Both live under `Storage/` so the finishing move is same-filesystem.

### Caching

`Sources/Cache/*` are process-wide singletons holding hot control-plane lookups (access key → secret/user/buckets, bucket policy, versioning, cluster nodes). Mutations broadcast through `CacheInvalidationService` over the inter-node protocol; a periodic full reload bounds staleness from a dropped broadcast. `CacheMissLedger` keeps bogus-key lookups from becoming cluster-wide reads.

## Conventions

- Tests use **swift-testing** (`@Suite`/`@Test`), not XCTest. Suites touching shared on-disk state are marked `.serialized`. `Tests/Helpers/Globals.swift` has the login/user fixtures; the in-process app is driven via `VaporTesting`'s `app.test`.
- Every source file carries the Apache 2.0 header comment.
- Comments in this codebase explain *why* — most non-obvious decisions already have a doc comment giving the failure they prevent. Read them before changing boot order, routing, placement, or outbox behaviour; extend in the same style rather than stripping them.
- Singleton-heavy design (caches, dispatchers, storage root are process-wide) means two `configure(app:)` instances can't coexist in one process — that's why cross-instance behaviour is tested by the root shell scripts rather than unit tests.
- Misconfiguration fails boot loudly (missing `JWT` in production, half-set cluster vars, nonsensical EC shard counts) rather than logging and serving anyway.
