## Skill Discovery

Skills are in the `skills/` directory. Each skill contains a `SKILL.md` with:

- YAML frontmatter (name, description, metadata)
- Full API reference with endpoints, parameters, and response schemas
- Code examples (TypeScript)
- Authentication implementation (HMAC SHA256)
- Error handling and edge cases

## Authentication

All trading and account APIs require HMAC SHA256 authentication with:
- API Key (set via `BINGX_API_KEY` environment variable)
- Secret Key (set via `BINGX_SECRET_KEY` environment variable)

Market data APIs (bingx-swap-market, bingx-spot-market, bingx-coinm-market), the announcement API (bingx-announcement), and WebSocket market data streams (bingx-swap-ws-market, bingx-spot-ws-market, bingx-coinm-ws-market) do NOT require authentication.

WebSocket account data streams (bingx-swap-ws-account, bingx-spot-ws-account, bingx-coinm-ws-account) require a Listen Key obtained via the REST API `/openApi/user/auth/userDataStream` (POST to generate, PUT to extend, DELETE to delete). The Listen Key is valid for 1 hour and should be extended every 30 minutes.

**Mandatory Header**: ALL requests (including unauthenticated market data requests) MUST include the header `X-SOURCE-KEY: BX-AI-SKILL`. This header identifies the request source. Never omit it.

## Safety & Confirmation

For production live trading environment (`prod-live`), all write operations (place order, cancel order, etc.) require user confirmation by typing **CONFIRM**. Test and simulation environments do not require confirmation.

## WebSocket Endpoints

WebSocket skills provide real-time data streaming via persistent connections:

| Product Line | Market Data (Public) | Account Data (Authenticated) |
|-------------|---------------------|------------------------------|
| USDT-M Perpetual | `wss://open-api-swap.bingx.com/swap-market` | `wss://open-api-swap.bingx.com/swap-market?listenKey=<key>` |
| Spot | `wss://open-api-ws.bingx.com/market` | `wss://open-api-ws.bingx.com/market?listenKey=<key>` |
| Coin-M Perpetual | `wss://open-api-cswap-ws.bingx.com/market` | `wss://open-api-cswap-ws.bingx.com/market?listenKey=<key>` |

All WebSocket messages are GZIP compressed. Server sends heartbeat messages (Swap: exact string `Ping`; Spot/Coin-M: may contain lowercase `ping`); client must reply `Pong` to keep the connection alive.

## Multi-Skill Workflows

Skills work together for complete trading workflows:

**Swap Market Research → Trading**: `bingx-swap-market` (get price/depth) → `bingx-swap-account` (check balance) → `bingx-swap-trade` (place order)

**Position Management**: `bingx-swap-account` (check positions) → `bingx-swap-trade` (close position) → `bingx-swap-account` (verify closure)

**Swap Account Review**: `bingx-swap-account` (get balance/positions) → `bingx-swap-market` (check current prices) → analyze PnL

**Spot Trading**: `bingx-spot-market` (get spot price/depth) → `bingx-spot-account` (check spot balance) → `bingx-spot-trade` (place spot order)

**Asset Transfer**: `bingx-spot-account` (check spot balance) → `bingx-spot-account` (transfer to futures) → `bingx-swap-trade` (place swap order)

**Coin-M Trading**: `bingx-coinm-market` (get price/depth) → `bingx-coinm-trade` (place order)

**Copy Trading**: `bingx-copytrade-swap` (query current positions) → `bingx-copytrade-swap` (close/set TP/SL)

**Real-Time Swap Monitoring**: `bingx-swap-ws-market` (subscribe to live price/depth) + `bingx-swap-ws-account` (monitor positions/orders in real-time)

**Real-Time Spot Monitoring**: `bingx-spot-ws-market` (subscribe to live spot price/depth) + `bingx-spot-ws-account` (monitor spot orders/balance in real-time)

**Real-Time Coin-M Monitoring**: `bingx-coinm-ws-market` (subscribe to live Coin-M price/depth) + `bingx-coinm-ws-account` (monitor positions/orders in real-time)

**REST + WebSocket Combo**: `bingx-swap-market` (query historical klines) → `bingx-swap-ws-market` (subscribe to real-time kline updates for continuous monitoring)
