# Heat Expansion Server

This repo is a Go backend for the Heat Expansion strategy game. It uses Hexagonal Architecture, DDD, and CQRS.

## Architecture & Layout

This repo is a **modular monolith**: each service lives under `internal/<service>`.

**Game service (primary):** `internal/game`
- `domain/`: Aggregates and domain logic (e.g. `UserBase`, `MilitaryOperation`, events, value objects).
- `application/`: application contracts, CQRS handlers, ports, and services
  - `commands/`: Write-side command handlers.
  - `queries/`: Read-side query handlers.
  - `readmodels/`: Query-side models returned by application queries.
  - `ports/`: Interfaces for repositories, schedulers, token providers, event publishing, transactions, etc.
  - `services/`: App-level services (access control, provisioning, outbox loop, ...).
- `infrastructure/`: Secondary adapters (DB/sqlc, readstore, jobs, events, security, content, ...).
- `interfaces/http`: Primary adapter (HTTP handlers/DTOs/middleware/router).
- `bootstrap/`: Dependency wiring for the game service.

**Auth service:** `internal/auth` (IAM, JWT, integration producers)

**Billing service:** `internal/billing` — crystal-package purchases via YooKassa. The webhook handler never trusts the request body; it re-queries YooKassa for canonical payment state. On success it emits `CrystalsPurchasedV1`, which the game service consumes to credit crystals (idempotent on `order_id`).

**Admin service:** `internal/admin` — back-office API for operators to manage game content and billing configuration. Uses server-side sessions with opaque bearer tokens (not JWT). Content management operations (prototypes, translations, crystal packages) are proxied to the game and billing modules via gRPC. Port model types used for gRPC proxying are co-located with their port interfaces in `ports/` rather than treated as CQRS read models. Owns its own database schema (`admin.admins`, `admin.sessions`).

**Shared contracts:** `contracts/` (versioned integration event schemas and HTTP OpenAPI contracts)

**Shared platform:** `internal/platform/` — infrastructure adapters reused across services (RabbitMQ publisher/consumer, JWT token validator, in-process event publisher, i18n translator core). When an adapter is needed by more than one service, it lives here rather than being duplicated.

## Key Patterns & Conventions

The patterns below apply to the **Game** service (`internal/game`) unless stated otherwise.

### Commands vs. queries
- Commands mutate state and live in `internal/game/application/commands`. They run inside `TransactionManager.WithTx`, use repositories from `application/ports`, and interact with aggregates in `domain/`.
- Queries do not mutate state and live in `internal/game/application/queries`. They depend on read repositories from `internal/game/infrastructure/readstore` and use shared services like access control from `application/services`.

### Repositories & transactions
- Repositories are declared as ports (e.g. `UserBaseRepository`, `SectorRepository`) and implemented in `internal/game/infrastructure/db/repo` using sqlc-generated `gen` packages.
- Use `Tx(tx)` on repositories and outbox interfaces when working inside a transaction; do not create new DB connections directly in core or handlers.
- Repository lookups return `*domain.X` / `[]*domain.X`, never values — a zero-value struct on the error path is a plausible-but-invalid object that can leak into the core, whereas `nil` cannot. On a non-nil error the pointer is `nil` (missing rows return `nil, ErrNotFound`); callers check the error first and never dereference on the error path.

### Domain events & outbox
- Aggregates emit domain events via `EventProducer` in `internal/game/domain`.
- Command handlers do **not** publish directly; they call `OutboxEventRepository.Save(events)` inside the transaction.
- `OutboxService` (in `internal/game/application/services/outbox_service.go`) runs in a background loop from `App.Run` and pulls from the `domain_events` table to publish via `EventPublisher`.
- When adding new events, update outbox DTOs/mappers in `internal/game/infrastructure/db/dtos` and `mappers` rather than encoding from domain types directly in handlers.

### Scheduled jobs
- Jobs are created via `Scheduler.Schedule()` inside event handlers, which run outside the outbox transaction. This means job creation and event acknowledgement are not atomic — the system provides **at-least-once** delivery, not exactly-once. Duplicate job executions are possible under crash/retry scenarios.
- **Every job handler must be idempotent.** Re-executing a handler with the same input must be safe. Use domain state guards (e.g. check current phase/status before acting) so that a duplicate invocation is a no-op.
- Jobs are never created directly in command handlers or outside of event handlers, to keep the creation path predictable.
- Self-rescheduling jobs (jobs that schedule the next iteration of themselves) must use **positive-only jitter**. Never subtract from the period when computing the next `executeAt` — firing before the full period has elapsed can interact badly with time-based idempotency checks and cause legitimate runs to be silently skipped.

### Module lifecycle: constructors may compute, only Run may connect
- `bootstrap.NewModule()` is pure wiring: env validation, PEM parsing, struct construction. It must not start goroutines. `db.Open` and `db.Ping` are the one accepted exception — they are cheap, context-free, and a bad DB URL or unreachable host should abort the process immediately before anything else starts.
- All other infrastructure I/O happens inside `Module.Run(ctx)` in a startup phase before the HTTP server starts serving: one-shot setup like `Adapters.Setup(ctx)` (e.g. game's translation load) and job seeding runs first, then broker connections are dialed by worker loops. This keeps startup cancelable by the signal context.
- Adapters that own connections (e.g. `RabbitMQPublisher`, `RabbitMQConsumer`) expose a blocking `Start(ctx) error`: it dials, reconnects on drops, and releases the connection when ctx is cancelled. They run as worker loops and never connect in their constructors. A failed initial dial is returned as an error and fails the module (fail fast).
- `Run(ctx) error` returns startup/serve failures instead of calling `log.Fatal`. `cmd/server` runs modules in an `errgroup`: one module's failure cancels the shared context so the others drain gracefully, and the process exits non-zero.

### Dependencies are never optional
- Command handlers, query handlers, and services treat their constructor dependencies as required. Do **not** add `nil` checks (e.g. `if c.Outbox != nil`) around injected ports/services.
- If something can be `nil`, fix the wiring in `internal/bootstrap` instead of guarding at the use site.

### Access control & provisioning
- Authorization checks should use `AccessControlService` (`internal/game/application/services/access_control_service.go`).
- Lazy creation of sectors/bases/locations uses `SectorProvisioningService` (also in `application/services`).

### HTTP layer
- Handlers in `internal/game/interfaces/http/handlers` should call into `bootstrap.Commands`/`bootstrap.Queries`, not directly into repositories or DB.
- Map domain/CQRS errors to HTTP status codes consistently using existing helpers in `http/dtos` and middleware.
- HTTP contracts live under `contracts/<service>/http/vN/openapi.yaml`. Whenever an HTTP route, request DTO, response DTO, status code, auth requirement, or public API behavior changes, update the matching OpenAPI spec in the same change.

### Integration events
- The shared `IntegrationEvent` envelope lives in `contracts/events/envelope.go` and uses `json.RawMessage` for its payload field. Versioned payload structs live in `contracts/<service>/events/v1/` alongside a typed `EventXxx` string constant (e.g., `EventAccountRegisteredV1 = "auth.account.registered.v1"`).
- **Producers**: `json.Marshal` the payload struct, then call `events.NewIntegrationEvent(originID, occurredAt, v1.EventXxx, payload)` and pass the result to `outbox.Save`. No `init()` registration or interface implementation needed on the payload type.
- **Consumers** (bootstrap wiring): `json.Unmarshal(d.Body, &envelope)` to get the envelope, then `switch envelope.Type` on the typed constant, then `json.Unmarshal(envelope.Payload, &typed)` for each known case. The default branch logs a warning and acks the message.
- Integration events are produced from domain events via an `IntegrationProducer` and stored in an `IntegrationOutbox`.
- Idempotency is enforced on `(origin_id, kind)` in the integration outbox table.
- Publishing is performed via RabbitMQ (using a `topic` exchange and event type as routing key) with a console fallback for local dev.

### Observability & logging

- Telemetry is initialised in `cmd/server/telemetry.go`. It wires up OTel TracerProvider, MeterProvider, and LoggerProvider, and bridges the global `slog` logger to OTel via `otelslog`. When `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` is empty the whole setup is a no-op.
- **Always use context-aware `slog` methods** (`slog.InfoContext`, `slog.WarnContext`, `slog.ErrorContext`, `slog.DebugContext`) rather than their context-free variants (`slog.Info`, `slog.Warn`, etc.). The `otelslog` bridge reads the active span from the context and injects `trace_id` and `span_id` into the log record, correlating logs with traces in Grafana. Dropping the context breaks that correlation silently.

### Internationalization (i18n)
- All user-facing strings (errors, notifications, prototype names) must be translatable.
- **Systemic locales**: Errors, alerts, and world generation text are stored in `internal/game/infrastructure/i18n/locales/*.json` and embedded into the binary via `go:embed`.
- **Content locales**: Service-specific content (e.g. prototype names, descriptions) is stored in the database and loaded at startup.
- **Key parity requirement**: Whenever a new translation key is introduced, add its translations immediately in both English and Russian locale files in the same change.
- **Domain errors**: Use `domain.NewError(key, params)` in domain logic. Never use `fmt.Errorf` with hardcoded English strings.
- **Application errors**: Use `application.NewAppError(kind, key)` or `application.NewAppErrorWithParams` for high-level application failures.
- **Presentation layer**: DTO mappers and HTTP handlers must use `ports.Translator` to resolve keys into final strings using the `locale` from the `Accept-Language` header.

## Workflows

- **Build**: `make build` builds `./cmd/server` into `bin/heat-expansion-server`.
- **Run locally**: `make run` (loads `.env`, then `go run ./cmd/server`). Ensure DB is running and `GAME_DB_URL`/`AUTH_DB_URL` are set.
- **Tests**: `make test` or `go test ./...` from repo root.
- **Migrations**: `make migrate-up` / `make migrate-down` (requires `migrate` CLI). Game SQL files live in `internal/game/infrastructure/db/migrations`.
- **Generated files**: never edit generated files directly. This includes `internal/game/infrastructure/readstore/gen/**` and any other generator output.
- **SQLC queries**: never write ad hoc SQL strings inside Go files. If a change needs a new or updated query, edit only `internal/game/infrastructure/db/queries/*.sql` or `internal/game/infrastructure/readstore/queries/*.sql`, then run `make sqlc`.

## How to Extend Safely

- When introducing new domain behavior, prefer adding methods to aggregates in `internal/game/domain` and invoking them from command handlers, rather than mutating models directly in handlers.
- For new write-side features, add/extend ports in `internal/game/application/ports`, implement them in `internal/game/infrastructure/db/repo`, wire them in `internal/game/bootstrap/adapters.go`, and inject via `Commands`/services.
- For new read-side endpoints, add read models and queries in `internal/game/infrastructure/readstore`, then wire new query facades in `internal/game/application/queries` and expose via HTTP handlers.
- For new integration events:
  1. Add a payload struct and `EventXxx` string constant in `contracts/<service>/events/v1/`.
  2. In the producer service, `json.Marshal` the payload and call `events.NewIntegrationEvent` with the typed constant, then save via `outbox.Save`.
  3. Add a `case v1.EventXxx:` branch to the relevant consumer's type-switch in `bootstrap/` that unmarshals `envelope.Payload` and dispatches to the handler.
- Keep serialization, DTOs, and DB schemas in infra layers (`dtos/`, `mappers/`, `queries/`), not in domain or application packages.
