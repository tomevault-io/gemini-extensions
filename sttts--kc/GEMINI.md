# Repository Guidelines

## Dependencies Policy (Important)
- Only use Bubble Tea v2: import `charm.land/bubbletea/v2` everywhere (including tests). Do NOT import `charm.land/bubbletea` without `/v2`.
- Keep module paths consistent with Go’s major version semantics. If a module ships a v2+, the import path must include the `/vN` suffix.
- If you see mixed v0/v1 vs v2 imports, fix them immediately and run `go mod tidy`.
- Example:
  - Correct: `tea "charm.land/bubbletea/v2"`
  - Incorrect: `tea "charm.land/bubbletea"` (will break types between v1/v2)

## Architecture & Project Structure

The application is a **Kubernetes TUI** built with **Go 1.24** and **Bubble Tea v2**, structured around a hierarchical navigation model where resources are treated as "folders" and "files".

### Core Components

1.  **Entry Point (`cmd/kc`)**:
    -   Uses `kong` for CLI argument parsing.
    -   Sets up `controller-runtime` logging (zap).
    -   Initializes the UI via `ui.Run`.

2.  **UI Core (`internal/ui`)**:
    -   **App Model**: The central Bubble Tea model (`App` struct in `app.go`). It manages global state: two panels (`leftPanel`, `rightPanel`), an integrated terminal, and modal overlays.
    -   **Panels**: Each `Panel` is a self-contained component that displays either a list of items (a "Folder") or a content viewer (YAML, logs).
    -   **Navigator**: (`internal/navigation`) Manages the navigation stack for each panel. It treats navigation as a stack of `Folder` objects, supporting "enter" (push) and "back" (pop) operations.

3.  **Data Layer (`internal/tablecache`, `internal/cluster`)**:
    -   **Live Data**: Uses **Informers** (via `controller-runtime`) to maintain a live cache of resources.
    -   **Table Cache**: Decorates standard K8s clients to produce "Table" views (similar to `kubectl get`). It watches for changes and updates the UI in real-time.
    -   **Cluster Pool**: Manages connections to Kubernetes clusters.

4.  **Abstraction (`internal/models`)**:
    -   **Folder Interface**: The core abstraction. A `Folder` provides a list of `Item`s.
    -   **Enterable Interface**: Items that can be "entered" (like a Namespace or a Pod) implement this interface to return a new `Folder`.
    -   **Universal Navigation**: Allows uniform navigation through Contexts → Namespaces → Resource Groups → Resources → Objects → Sub-resources.

### Key Characteristics
-   **Server-Side Rendering**: Relies on server-side printing (Table output) from Kubernetes to determine how to display resources, ensuring compatibility with CRDs.
-   **"Vibe-Coded"**: Embraces an AI-assisted, experimental coding style, prioritizing features and "feel" over strict traditional rigor, while maintaining a solid modular architecture.

### Directory Layout
-   `cmd/kc/`: Application entrypoint.
-   `internal/ui/`: TUI components (App, Panel, Terminal).
-   `internal/models/`: Core interfaces (Folder, Item, Enterable).
-   `internal/tablecache/`: Live data caching and Table view materialization.
-   `internal/cluster/`: Kubeconfig and client pool management.
-   `internal/navigation/`: Stack-based navigation logic.
-   `pkg/`: Reusable helpers (config, etc.).
-   `examples/`: Minimal runnable samples.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- Build binary: `go build -o kc ./cmd/kc`
- Run binary: `./kc`
- Run without building: `go run ./cmd/kc`
- Run examples: `go run examples/handler/main.go`
- Headless TUI driver: `go run ./cmd/bubbleheadless -- go run ./cmd/kc`
- All tests (verbose): `go test ./... -v`
- With coverage: `go test ./... -cover`
- Static checks: `go vet ./...`
- Tidy modules (after dep changes): `go mod tidy`

### Headless Bubbleterm Wrapper
- `cmd/bubbleheadless` is a REPL-style driver around bubbleterm for end-to-end automation in non-interactive environments.
- Launch it with `go run ./cmd/bubbleheadless -- <app command...>`; e.g. `go run ./cmd/bubbleheadless -- go run ./cmd/kc`.
- Once started, send commands over stdin:
  - `key <token>` / `text <string>` to feed keystrokes,
  - `mouse <button> <x> <y> <press|release|motion>` for mouse events,
  - `screen [ansi|plain]` to dump the current framebuffer,
  - `snapshot <file.png>` to write a PNG render of the terminal,
  - `resize <cols> <rows>` and `wait` / `exit` for session control.
- Designed for CI/e2e test harnesses—script it from shell pipelines or expect-like drivers without allocating a PTY.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Format: `go fmt ./...` (CI expects gofmt-clean code).
- Lint mindset: prefer small packages, clear interfaces, early returns.
- Naming: package names lower-case, no underscores; exported identifiers `CamelCase`, unexported `camelCase`.
- Errors: wrap with `%w` (e.g., `fmt.Errorf("reading config: %w", err)`).
- Files: group closely related types; avoid large god files.

## Logging Guidelines
- Always import controller-runtime logging as `ctrllog` (e.g., `ctrllog "sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/pkg/log"`).
- Thread a `context.Context` through the call chain and retrieve loggers with `ctrllog.FromContext(ctx)`; never grab the global logger directly.
- Name the logger variable `log`, and derive new loggers with `log := ctrllog.FromContext(ctx).WithName("component")` before use.
- Treat `Deps.Ctx` as the long-lived root context (e.g., for informers). For request-scoped or short-lived work, derive a child context from it and pass that down. Accessing `Deps.Ctx` directly should be the exception, not the default.
- Never store `context.Context` on structs; pass it explicitly through call chains. The sole allowed long-lived context is `Deps.Ctx` for cluster/informer lifecycle management.
- In Go tests, use `t.Context()` to derive request-scoped contexts instead of `context.Background()` or `context.TODO()`.
- `context.Context` must never be nil; do not check for nil and do not create fallbacks. Always thread a real, non-nil context from the caller.
- Every real client request (non-cache/informer) must log an INFO line before issuing the request (e.g., REST/dynamic/client-go List/Get/Delete/Watch), including GVR/namespace and key parameters, so DEBUG=1 traces outbound calls.

## Abstraction Guidelines
- Prefer composition over wrapping: do not re-invent controller-runtime/client-go abstractions. Embed or compose original types instead of creating near-duplicates.
- Use Kubernetes/client-go types and `controller-runtime` primitives directly (clients, caches, informers, RESTMapper). Add small adapters only where strictly needed.
- Use the controller-runtime shared cache/informers from the Cluster pool; do not start ad-hoc dynamic watches or bespoke informers. All watch/list refreshes must go through the shared cache.

### Identity & Keys (Kubernetes)
- Always use the full GroupVersionResource (GVR) when constructing keys/IDs for folders, items, history, or selection state. The resource name alone is NOT unique across groups and versions.
- Prefer `gvr.GroupVersion().String()` when composing strings; for core resources this yields `v1` and for others `group/version`.
- Examples:
  - Folder keys: `namespaces/<ns>/<group>/<version>/<resource>` (namespaced) or `<group>/<version>/<resource>` (cluster-scoped).
  - Row IDs: `group/version/resource` (not just `resource`).
- Avoid ad-hoc Kind/Version strings for identity; use GVR consistently.

### Config Defaults Consistency
- Keep configuration defaults in sync across:
  - Code: `pkg/appconfig.Default()`
  - Documentation sample: `config-default.yaml` in the repo root
  - README “Configuration” section
- A unit test (`pkg/appconfig/defaults_test.go`) loads `config-default.yaml` and compares it with `Default()`. Update both when changing defaults; do not let them drift.

## Documentation Scope
- Treat `README.md` as purely user-facing; do not direct users to run releases. Release steps are maintainer-only and covered in `docs/RELEASING.md`.

## Testing Guidelines
- Framework: standard `testing` with table-driven tests and `t.Run` subtests.
- Location: `*_test.go` alongside sources (e.g., `pkg/handlers/handler_test.go`).
- Policy: non-trivial logic MUST be covered by unit tests.
- Scope: prioritize `pkg/handlers`, `pkg/kubeconfig`, and `internal/ui` model logic; keep tests deterministic (no live clusters).
- Commands: `go test ./pkg/handlers/... -v`, `go test ./internal/ui/... -v`.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Commit style (observed): short, imperative subjects (e.g., "Add cmd/kc", "Update README").
- Commit in logical pieces; do not mix unrelated changes. Use partial staging (e.g., `git add -p`) to craft focused commits.
- Recommended: optional scope prefixes (e.g., `handlers: add pod logs`) and meaningful bodies when needed.
- PRs must include: concise summary, rationale, test plan/commands, linked issues, and screenshots/GIFs for TUI changes.
- Keep changes focused; include or update tests and docs relevant to your change.

### Build & Test Before Commit
- Build and test when you changed code or tests. At minimum: `go build ./...` and `go test ./...` (or the impacted packages when the full suite is costly). Do not commit if build or tests fail.
- Repeated/fixup commits without new code changes don’t need another build/test cycle.
- Docs-only commits do not require build/test.
- Before committing, run `git status` to ensure there are no unintended or forgotten changes; stage only what belongs in the focused commit.

### Environment Variables (Go builds)
- Never set `GOPATH` or `GOCACHE` in commands or CI. Use the default environment so Go’s module and toolchain behavior works as intended.

See `TODO.md` for the active development plan and current tasks. Keep every TODO entry prefixed with `- [ ]` / `- [x]` and check off items as soon as they are completed.

### Git Hygiene
- If `index.lock` exists or a commit fails due to a lock, stop and escalate to the user. Do not delete or retry until the user explicitly clears or approves a retried command.

### Permission Issues
- Do not override default Go/module cache locations.
- If a command fails due to permissions or sandboxing, immediately rerun it with `with_escalated_permissions: true` and a short justification (do not pause to ask first). Use escalation rather than changing cache locations.
- Apply the same rule to git permission/lock errors (e.g., `index.lock`): rerun with escalation rather than waiting for additional approval.
- Never use `git add -A`; stage only intended files.

### AI Disclosure
- Add an explicit co-author trailer to every commit as the last line, using the AI’s name and the maker’s noreply domain, e.g.:
  `Co-Authored-By: Codex CLI Agent <noreply@openai.com>`
- Use the exact format `Co-Authored-By: <name> <noreply@maker-domain>`.

## Security & Configuration Tips
- Never commit kubeconfigs, cluster credentials, or secrets.
- Use `KUBECONFIG` or default `~/.kube/config`; prefer non-production contexts when developing.
- Avoid tests that require cluster access; abstract clients to allow fakes/mocks.
