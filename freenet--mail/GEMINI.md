# Freenet Email – Agent Guide

## Overview

Decentralized email application built on Freenet. Uses Dioxus for the web UI,
WASM contracts for inbox storage, and Anti-Flood Tokens (AFT) for rate limiting.

## One-time setup

```bash
git config core.hooksPath .githooks   # Enable repo-local git hooks
```

The pre-commit hook blocks stray `.wasm` commits outside
`published-contract/` and requires `contract-id.txt` to be staged
alongside any WASM change.

## Quick Reference

### Key Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `freenet-stdlib` | Freenet contract/delegate SDK |
| `dioxus` | Web UI framework (WASM) |
| `ml-kem` | ML-KEM-768 (NIST FIPS 203) post-quantum key encapsulation for message encryption |
| `ml-dsa` | ML-DSA-65 (NIST FIPS 204) post-quantum signatures for inbox state deltas and AFT |
| `chacha20poly1305` | Symmetric encryption for message content (key from ML-KEM) |
| `freenet-aft-interface` | Anti-Flood Token protocol |
| `identity-management` | Identity delegate for alias management |

### Architecture

- **Inbox Contract**: Stores encrypted messages on Freenet. ML-DSA-65 signatures
  verify ownership of state deltas. Messages are gated by AFT tokens to prevent spam.
- **Web Container**: Minimal contract that hosts the compiled Dioxus UI as a
  Freenet webapp.
- **UI**: Dioxus WASM app communicating with a local Freenet node via WebSocket.
  Handles identity creation, message composition, encryption, and inbox display.
- **AFT Integration**: Each sent message requires a token from the Anti-Flood
  Token system, preventing spam while preserving sender privacy.

### Feature flag matrix

The UI crate at `ui/Cargo.toml` exposes four features that compose to
produce different builds. The cell shows whether that combination is a
supported build target and what it's used for.

| Flag          | Purpose                                                                                  |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `use-node`    | Default. Enables the WebSocket bridge to a local Freenet node and all contract calls.    |
| `example-data`| Seeds the UI with two mock identities (`address1`, `address2`) and mock inboxes.          |
| `no-sync`     | Disables the WebSocket bridge entirely. Must be combined with `example-data` to be useful.|
| `contract`    | (inbox crate, not ui) Enables the inbox contract's `ContractInterface` impl.             |

**Supported combinations:**

| Build                                                        | What it's for                                |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `cargo make build` (default: `use-node`)                     | Production release, talks to a real node    |
| `cargo make dev-example` (`example-data,no-sync`)            | Offline dev loop, no node required           |
| `cargo make build-ui-example-no-sync`                        | CI Playwright builds (same flags as above)   |
| `cargo test -p freenet-email-inbox --features contract`      | Inbox contract integration tests (host)     |

`example-data + use-node` is technically buildable but has no user —
the app always reaches for the node when `use-node` is set. Use
`no-sync` whenever you want offline mode.

### Running a Freenet node

There are two modes depending on what you're doing:

| Mode                 | Command               | When to use                                                   |
|----------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Local sandbox**    | `freenet local` (or `cargo make run-node`) | Developing contracts, running integration tests, publishing the test contract |
| **Network-connected**| `freenet network`     | Production publish, smoke-testing the live webapp             |

The local sandbox is entirely self-contained — it spins up a single-node
network with no peers, so publishing to it doesn't propagate anywhere
and can't be observed from other machines. It's the right target for
`publish-email-test`, `publish-all`, and every Phase 3 / Phase 4
automated test.

The network-connected mode joins the real Freenet network and is the
target for production publishes: `publish-email`, `publish-production`,
and `scripts/release.sh`. The first publish takes ~30s to propagate
before the gateway URL resolves.

> **⚠️ Port collision — never test-publish onto a running `freenet network` node.**
> `freenet local`/`fdev` both default to **port 7509**. If a long-running
> `freenet network` node already owns 7509 (some dev machines run one under
> launchd), then `cargo make publish-email-test` / `publish-all` will publish
> the **test-key contract onto the real network** and drive your manual QA
> against the wrong node. Before any test publish:
> 1. `ps aux | grep "[f]reenet network"` — if one is up, 7509 is the real net.
> 2. Start a dedicated sandbox on a free port and target it, e.g.
>    `freenet local --ws-api-port 7600`, then publish/QA against 7600.
> 3. `publish-email-test`/`publish-all` run `update-published-contract`, which
>    **overwrites** `published-contract/contract-id.txt` + `webapp.parameters`
>    with the TEST id, clobbering the committed **prod** snapshot. After QA:
>    `git checkout -- published-contract/contract-id.txt published-contract/webapp.parameters`.
>    **Never commit that diff** — the committed snapshot is the prod-key id.
>
> (`WEB_CONTAINER_CONTRACT_ID` is embedded from `contract-id.txt` at build
> time but is **diagnostic-only** — logged in `ui/src/lib.rs`, never used for a
> contract op — so a wrong embedded id is cosmetic console noise, not a
> functional break.)

### Testing

```bash
cargo test --workspace              # All tests
cargo test -p freenet-email-inbox   # Inbox contract tests only
cargo make test-ui-playwright       # Playwright E2E tests (build + serve + test)
cargo make test-ui-playwright-setup # One-time: install Playwright browsers
```

### Build Targets

- `wasm32-unknown-unknown`: Contracts (inbox, web-container) and UI
- Native: Development tools (`identity-management` key generator,
  `web-container-sign` signer)

## Publishing

Freenet-email follows `freenet-river`'s signed-and-committed publishing
pattern: every release is a pair of `(ed25519 signature, webapp bytes)`
under a contract ID that is deterministic given the committed source.

### Directory layout

```
freenet-email/
├── published-contract/          # ← committed snapshot (W4 of #6)
│   ├── contract-id.txt          # base58 ContractInstanceId
│   ├── web_container_contract.wasm
│   ├── webapp.parameters        # 32 bytes: ed25519 verifying key

└── tools/
    └── web-container-sign/      # the signer binary (our web-container-tool)
```

### Sandbox publish (test)

1. Start a local Freenet node in another shell:
   ```bash
   cargo make run-node
   ```
2. From a fresh checkout, run the end-to-end flow:
   ```bash
   cargo make publish-all
   ```
   This chains `build` → `update-published-contract` →
   `publish-email-test`. The committed test key at
   `test-contract/web-container-keys.toml` is used for signing, and the
   derived contract ID must match
   `published-contract/contract-id.txt` — if it doesn't, the
   committed snapshot has drifted and you should commit the diff.

3. To refresh the committed snapshot without publishing:
   ```bash
   cargo make update-published-contract
   git add published-contract/ && git commit -m "chore: refresh published-contract snapshot"
   ```

### Production publish

Production uses an **uncommitted** ed25519 keypair at
`~/.config/freenet-email/web-container-keys.toml` (override with
`WEB_CONTAINER_KEY_FILE=/path/to/keys.toml`).

**One-time setup** — generate the key via the release script:

```bash
scripts/generate-production-key.sh
```

This writes the keypair with `chmod 600` and prints a reminder to back
it up offline. **Never commit this file.** Losing it means rotating the
production contract ID and every user losing access to the previous
deployment.

**End-to-end release** — use the release driver:

```bash
scripts/release.sh 0.1.0
```

See `RELEASING.md` for the full runbook, preconditions, and recovery
procedures. Under the hood this runs `cargo make publish-production`,
which chains `build` → `update-published-contract-prod` →
`publish-email`.

The production key produces a **different** contract ID than the test
key, because the ID is `hash(wasm, parameters)` and the 32-byte
`webapp.parameters` blob is the verifying key itself. The committed
`published-contract/contract-id.txt` is the one signed by the
*production* key; the test snapshot lives in git history but gets
overwritten by `cargo make update-published-contract-prod` on every
real release.

### Facade contract — stable URL across releases (issue #200, Phase 1)

The web-container contract id rotates whenever workspace `Cargo.lock`
churn shifts the wasm bytes (issue #198). To give users a permanent
bookmarkable URL, the project ships a **facade** contract whose id is
designed to stay byte-stable across every release.

```
contracts/facade/                 stable wasm — never rebuilt for a release
contracts/facade-loader/          static HTML+JS shell served by the facade
published-contract/facade.wasm    committed snapshot; CI enforces byte-equality
published-contract/facade-id.txt  the stable contract id users bookmark
published-contract/facade.parameters
                                  32-byte ed25519 verifying key (same prod key
                                  as web-container; the "publisher identity")
```

Per release the facade WASM is unchanged. Only the facade contract's
state changes — its `current_app_id` pointer is flipped via
`fdev execute update`, signing with the same production key. The loader
HTML is rendered with the new app id baked in by
`scripts/build-loader.sh` and embedded in the new state. `prev_app_ids`
keeps a small ring of previous pointers for client-side rollback.

State framing matches the web-container's `[meta_len][meta][web_len][web]`,
but `meta` carries `FacadePointer { version, current_app_id, prev_app_ids }`
instead of just a webapp signature. Signature payload is canonicalized
hand-rolled bytes (see `freenet_email_core::facade::signed_payload`) to
sidestep CBOR map-ordering concerns.

**Phase 1 scope**: facade lives alongside the web-container, not yet
replacing it. The UI is still served at the rotating web-container id;
the facade is published once per environment as the new stable entry
point.

**Phase 3 scope (#200)**: `scripts/release.sh` automatically renders +
signs + UPDATEs the facade pointer per release (so users hitting the
facade URL get the new app). UI's `lib.rs` logs both
`WEB_CONTAINER_CONTRACT_ID` and `FACADE_CONTRACT_ID` on startup so
devtools shows which facade a build references. Both are conditional
on `published-contract/facade-id.txt` being committed (one-time facade
publish required first; see RELEASING.md §"Facade contract update").

#### Pointer lifecycle — how the facade actually serves a release

Each release rotates the web-container contract id but leaves the
facade contract id fixed. The full chain on every release:

1. `cargo make build` rebuilds the UI webapp. Workspace `Cargo.lock`
   churn shifts wasm bytes, producing a new `published-contract/contract-id.txt`.
2. `scripts/build-loader.sh <new_app_id>` substitutes the new id into
   `contracts/facade-loader/src/index.html.tmpl` → writes
   `contracts/facade-loader/dist/index.html`. This loader is the file
   the facade actually serves; it's a static HTML+JS page that
   redirects the browser to the new web-container url.
3. `cargo make pack-facade-loader` tars + xzs the loader into
   `target/facade/loader.tar.xz`. The gateway's `WebApp::try_from`
   pipeline (XzDecoder → tar.unpack) requires this exact framing, see
   memory `facade_state_framing.md`.
4. `cargo make sign-facade-state` signs a fresh `FacadePointer { version=now, current_app_id=<new>, prev_app_ids=[<old>] }`
   with the production key from `~/.config/freenet-email/web-container-keys.toml`.
   Output: `target/facade/facade.state` (signed `[meta_len][meta][web_len][web]`).
5. `fdev execute update --as-state <facade_id> target/facade/facade.state`
   pushes the new state to the network. **`--as-state` is required** —
   default is `UpdateData::Delta` which a facade-style contract rejects
   silently as `InvalidUpdate` (memory `fdev_update_needs_as_state.md`).
6. `scripts/release.sh` commits the new web-container snapshot, tags,
   pushes.

The facade contract id never changes across any of this. Users
bookmark `/v1/contract/web/<facade_id>/` once and that URL keeps
working release after release.

#### Loader must postMessage, not location.replace (v0.1.8)

The gateway wraps every contract URL response in a shell page with a
sandboxed iframe and `X-Frame-Options: DENY` on the shell. Inside the
sandbox, the loader cannot `window.location.replace(<new_app_url>)` —
the new app's gateway response would have to render inside our iframe,
and XFO DENY blocks that (Firefox: "Firefox Can't Open This Page").

The fix: the loader posts `{__freenet_shell__: true, type: 'navigate', href: <new_app_url>}`
to `window.parent`. The freenet-core shell already implements
cross-contract navigation for that message — it does a top-level
`window.location.assign` outside our iframe, which loads a fresh
shell for the new contract id. See `path_handlers.rs:836` in
freenet-core for the handler.

Fallback path: if the loader is opened standalone (e.g. `?__sandbox=1`
or a dev fetch with no parent frame), it uses `window.location.replace`
so the dev UX still works.

#### Manual pointer flip / recovery

If `scripts/release.sh` aborts after publish-webapp (e.g. fdev's
300s timeout — see freenet-core#4102 — fires even though the publish
landed), resume the pointer flip manually:

```bash
# 1. Confirm the new webapp actually published.
curl -sI "http://127.0.0.1:7509/v1/contract/web/$(cat published-contract/contract-id.txt)/" \
  | head -1   # expect HTTP/1.1 200

# 2. Rebuild loader + repack + re-sign state with the production key.
cargo make sign-facade-state
# (chains build-facade-loader → pack-facade-loader → sign)

# 3. Push the pointer update.
fdev execute update --as-state \
  "$(cat published-contract/facade-id.txt)" \
  target/facade/facade.state
# expect "Contract updated successfully" + StateSummary

# 4. Verify the facade now serves the new loader.
curl -s "http://127.0.0.1:7509/v1/contract/web/$(cat published-contract/facade-id.txt)/?__sandbox=1" \
  | grep CURRENT_APP_ID
# expect the new app id baked in

# 5. Open the facade URL in a browser. The loader should postMessage
# the shell and the shell should navigate to the new web-container url.
```

If step 4 returns the old app id, the gateway likely served a stale
extracted webapp from its on-disk cache. The gateway extracts the
webapp tar.xz on GetResponse and writes the extracted files to its
webapp_cache directory; UPDATEs that change the `web` slot don't
invalidate that cache until the next contract get. Bust the cache by
hand:

```bash
# macOS:
CACHE_DIR="$HOME/Library/Caches/The-Freenet-Project-Inc.freenet/webapp_cache"
# Linux:
# CACHE_DIR="$HOME/.cache/freenet/webapp_cache"
FACADE_ID=$(cat published-contract/facade-id.txt)
rm -rf "${CACHE_DIR}/${FACADE_ID}" "${CACHE_DIR}/${FACADE_ID}.hash"

# Trigger a GetResponse by hitting the MAIN URL (not ?__sandbox=1).
# The sandbox endpoint short-circuits on cache miss with a 500.
curl -s -o /dev/null "http://127.0.0.1:7509/v1/contract/web/${FACADE_ID}/"
```

This is a freenet-core gateway issue. The pointer is correct on-chain
(verified by `fdev execute get`); the staleness is local to the
gateway's extracted-webapp cache. Track downstream as a freenet-core
issue when you next encounter it.

#### What NOT to commit per release

- `target/facade/facade.state` is signed with the production key and
  carries a per-build timestamp version. **Do not commit it** — every
  release re-signs. Only the WASM/parameters/id snapshot under
  `published-contract/facade.*` is checked into git, and that triplet
  stays byte-stable across releases by design.
- `contracts/facade-loader/dist/index.html` is regenerated from
  `src/index.html.tmpl` at every release. Don't hand-edit dist; edit
  the tmpl and let `build-loader.sh` re-render.

**Inbox + AFT lockfile isolation (issue #199 Phase A)**: same pattern
extended to every other on-chain contract:

- `contracts/inbox/` — the inbox contract.
- `modules/antiflood-tokens/contracts/token-allocation-record/` — the
  AFT token-allocation-record contract.
- `modules/antiflood-tokens/delegates/token-generator/` — the AFT
  token-generator delegate.
- `modules/antiflood-tokens/interfaces/` — shared aft-interface types
  crate (analog of facade-types). Path-dep'd by all three contracts AND
  by the workspace UI.

All four are listed in `[workspace.exclude]`. Each has its own
`Cargo.lock` and =x.y.z pins on every dep that influences wasm output
(chrono, ml-dsa, freenet-stdlib, etc.). Each also has a one-line
`[workspace]` stanza so `fdev`'s `get_workspace_target_dir()` walk
doesn't panic.

Net effect: bumping any workspace dep (dioxus, ml-kem) cannot rotate
inbox.wasm or AFT contract wasms, so users' stored messages and AFT
token ledgers stay accessible across releases. To deliberately rotate
(e.g. for a contract bugfix that requires data migration), edit the
=x.y.z pin in the relevant Cargo.toml and pair the change with the
per-identity migration story.

**Inbox migration (#213/#223, shipped; #251 hardening)**: on UI
startup the `set_aliases` callback in `ui/src/api.rs` compares the
embedded `INBOX_CODE_HASH` against the `inbox_wasm_hash` recorded on
each identity in the identity-management delegate. On drift it
dispatches GETs for the old inbox keys (chained over every plausible
historical hash — see below), and the GetResponse arm decodes the
old state, re-signs via `Inbox::new`, and PUTs it under the current
inbox key. Toast surfaces the migration to the user. On first
observation (`inbox_wasm_hash = None`) the UI stamps the current
hash as a baseline so the next bump is detectable. The schema bump
on the delegate is backwards-compatible (`#[serde(default)]` on
`AliasInfo.inbox_wasm_hash`).

**AFT contract migration (#251 improvement 3)**: same shape applied
to the AFT token-allocation-record contract. `AliasInfo` carries
`aft_record_wasm_hash` + `pending_aft_migration_from`;
`LEGACY_TOKEN_RECORD_CODE_HASHES` in `ui/src/aft.rs` is the
append-only oldest→newest list (parallel to
`LEGACY_INBOX_CODE_HASHES`). On startup, after the inbox loop, the
UI runs the same drift / chained-migration / persistent-retry loop
against `TOKEN_RECORD_CODE_HASH`, dispatching GETs for each prior
AFT-record key and re-PUTing the decoded `TokenAllocationRecord`
under the current key. Re-validation works because the contract's
`TokenDelegateParameters.generator_public_key` is the identity's
ML-DSA verifying key, which is unchanged across an AFT contract
bump. The token-generator delegate is not migrated (its key derives
from the identity's ML-DSA seed, not from the WASM, so it rotates
only when the seed changes — i.e. never under a deliberate
contract bump). The `current_aft_hash_not_in_legacy` test
enforces the same append-only invariant as the inbox slice.
`token_delegate_parameters_are_deterministic_per_vk` pins the
load-bearing claim that `TokenDelegateParameters::new(&vk)` encodes
byte-identically across calls.

Deliberate AFT-record rotation recipe: edit a `=x.y.z` pin in
`modules/antiflood-tokens/contracts/token-allocation-record/Cargo.toml`
(or the contract source), `cargo make build-token-allocation-record`,
append the prior `TOKEN_RECORD_CODE_HASH` to
`LEGACY_TOKEN_RECORD_CODE_HASHES` in `ui/src/aft.rs`, ship. Schema
of `TokenAllocationRecord` itself must stay compatible — appending
to the legacy slice migrates state byte-for-byte; a JSON-schema
change in the same release would silently fail `validate_state`
per user and needs a dedicated re-shape pass in
`put_migrated_aft_record`.

**Chained migration (#251 improvement 2)**: `LEGACY_INBOX_CODE_HASHES`
in `ui/src/inbox.rs` is an append-only oldest→newest list of every
prior `INBOX_CODE_HASH`. `build_migration_candidates` walks from the
recorded hash forward and `migrate_inbox` dispatches a GET per
candidate; the first GetResponse to resolve wins, suppressed by
`MIGRATED_IDENTITIES` (keyed by ML-DSA verifying-key bytes, not the
mutable alias). Append the previous hash to the slice as part of any
deliberate inbox-contract bump so users skipping releases still
recover. The current `INBOX_CODE_HASH` must never appear in the slice
— enforced by the `current_hash_not_in_legacy` test.

**Sender-side recipient hash (#251 improvement 4)**: the inbox WASM
hash a recipient was running at import time is captured on the
contact (`StoredContactKeys.inbox_wasm_hash`,
`Contact.inbox_wasm_hash`) from the import-fetch `GetResponse`'s
`key.code_hash()`. The send path
(`inbox.rs::start_sending`, `aft.rs::assign_token`,
`inbox.rs::inbox_key_for_with_hash`) addresses the recipient's
inbox under THAT hash, falling back to the sender's embedded
`INBOX_CODE_HASH` when the field is absent (own-identity sends,
contacts imported before this shipped). This decouples sender and
recipient upgrade schedules — an upgraded sender can still deliver
to a non-upgraded recipient. Stored as a bs58 string (encoded via
plain `bs58::encode`, NOT `CodeHash::encode` whose `to_lowercase`
breaks the roundtrip with `ContractKey::from_params`). Migration
to a fresher hash on the recipient's side is out of scope — the
hash sticks until the user re-imports the contact card; the
in-protocol upgrade pointer (#251 improvement 1) is the longer-
term fix for that.

Every helper that derives a contact's on-chain inbox key from its
ML-DSA VK MUST go through `inbox_key_for_with_hash` with the
contact's `inbox_wasm_hash` (fallback to `INBOX_CODE_HASH`) — using
`inbox_key_for` (sender's hash) silently breaks contact recognition
for cross-version contacts. Currently:
`ui/src/app/address_book.rs::is_contact_inbox_key`,
`::lookup_by_bs58`, and the rehydrate + CreateContact prime GETs in
`ui/src/api.rs` (~1442 and ~2540). `inbox_key_for` is still correct
for OWN-identity derivations (own inbox is at the sender's embedded
hash by construction).

**Persistent migration retry (#251 improvement 5)**:
`AliasInfo.pending_migration_from: Option<String>` is stamped on the
identity-management delegate via `IdentityMsg::SetPendingMigrationFrom`
BEFORE dispatching the migration GETs, and cleared (set to `None`)
only when the PUT under the current inbox key succeeds. On startup
`select_migrate_from` (in `ui/src/inbox.rs`) prefers a non-None
pending marker over the recorded hash, so a session whose GET never
resolved (node offline, contract expired) re-attempts on the next
session. Stale markers (`prior == current` with a leftover pending
value) are cleared in the no-drift branch.

**Facade lockfile isolation (issue #198)**: the facade contract and its
shared types crate live OUTSIDE the freenet-email workspace:

- `contracts/facade-types/` — tiny crate with `FacadePointer`,
  `FacadeMetadata`, `signed_payload()`, `FACADE_MAX_PREV_APP_IDS`. Its
  only deps are `ed25519-dalek` and `serde`.
- `contracts/facade/` — the on-chain contract crate. Path-deps on
  `freenet-email-facade-types`. Has its own `Cargo.lock` with `=x.y.z`
  pins on `byteorder`, `ciborium`, `ed25519-dalek`, `freenet-stdlib`.

Both are listed in `[workspace.exclude]` of the root `Cargo.toml`. The
freenet-email workspace re-exports the same types via
`freenet-email-core::facade::*` (path-dep on `freenet-email-facade-types`)
so signer + UI keep their existing imports unchanged.

Net effect: bumping `dioxus`, `chrono`, `ml-dsa`, or any other
workspace dep cannot rotate `facade.wasm`, because cargo resolves the
facade build against `contracts/facade/Cargo.lock` — not the workspace
lockfile. To deliberately bump a facade dep, edit the `=x.y.z` pin in
`contracts/facade/Cargo.toml` (and pair with a snapshot regeneration +
release-id update; see #200).

**Build hygiene**: `scripts/check-facade-byte-equal.sh` rebuilds the
facade (using the facade-local manifest at `contracts/facade/`) and
`cmp`s against `published-contract/facade.wasm`. CI runs this step in
`check-contract-wasm.yml`. The main `build.yml` workflow also runs
`cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy`, `cargo test`, and a wasm32 release build
inside `contracts/facade/` so PRs that touch facade are still gated.

**Status (#206 closed)**: the committed snapshot at
`published-contract/facade.{wasm,parameters,id.txt}` is the canonical
artifact. It was produced under linux/amd64 with the rustc version
pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml` (currently 1.95.0). The CI byte-equality
step in `check-contract-wasm.yml` is now a **release blocker**: any
rebuild that doesn't match the committed bytes fails the PR.

To regenerate the snapshot deliberately (e.g. after bumping the rustc
pin or a `=x.y.z` dep pin in `contracts/facade/Cargo.toml`):

**On native linux/amd64**:

```bash
scripts/build-facade-snapshot-linux.sh
git add published-contract/facade.{wasm,parameters,id.txt}
git commit -m "chore(facade): regenerate snapshot — <reason>"
```

**On macOS / arm64 / anything else**: qemu emulation produces wasm
bytes that drift from CI's native amd64 build (verified empirically),
so local rebuilds can't match the gate. Use the CI-bootstrap path:

1. Push the change with whatever facade.wasm bytes are on disk (any
   non-empty file works — gate WILL fail).
2. The `check-contract-wasm.yml` job rebuilds and uploads the
   canonical wasm as workflow artifact `facade-wasm-rebuilt-<sha>`.
3. Download via
   `gh run download <run-id> -n facade-wasm-rebuilt-<sha>`.
4. Replace `published-contract/facade.wasm`, recompute the id with
   `fdev get-contract-id --code … --parameters …`, write to
   `published-contract/facade-id.txt`, commit, push.
5. CI passes.

The local `check-facade-byte-equal.sh` skips with a warning on
non-canonical hosts so dev rebuilds aren't blocked.

### Reproducibility caveats

The signed-payload version is the **unix timestamp at signing time**
(see `sign-webapp` / `sign-webapp-test` in `Makefile.toml`). Two
developers signing at different moments produce different payloads
and therefore different contract IDs, so
`published-contract/contract-id.txt` is **not** reproducible from
source. The committed snapshot is the authoritative ID for the
deployed contract; `cargo make update-published-contract*` rewrites
it on every refresh.

Why timestamp instead of a deterministic-from-source value: the
on-chain web-container update check requires strictly monotonic
versions. The previous scheme (commit-hash hex truncated to u32) was
not monotonic — newer commits could hash lower than the deployed
state — and broke the v0.1.1 publish. Commit count
(`git rev-list --count HEAD`) is monotonic per branch but starts at
~22, far below the version (~1.6e9) the chain already accepted under
the broken scheme. Timestamp is the simplest source that's always
above the deployed value.

GNU tar is still required by `compress-webapp` for the
`--sort=name --mtime=… --owner=0 --group=0` flags; the resulting
archive is byte-identical across machines (rustc pin and release
profile are also pinned), but the per-build timestamp injected at
signing time means the final signed bytes differ. Install GNU tar:

```bash
brew install gnu-tar   # provides `gtar`
```

The `cargo make compress-webapp` target detects `gtar` / GNU `tar`
automatically and emits a loud warning when falling back to BSD tar.
`scripts/release.sh` errors out at preflight if GNU tar is missing.

### Security — committed test key

The ed25519 keypair at `test-contract/web-container-keys.toml` is
**committed on purpose** so the test contract ID is reproducible
across clones. Anyone with read access to this repository can sign
webapps under the test contract ID, but the key grants no access to
any user data and must never be reused for production. See
`test-contract/README.md` for the full threat model.

### Regenerating test keys

Two committed test keys live under `test-contract/`:

1. **Web container signer** (`test-contract/web-container-keys.toml`) —
   ed25519, used to sign test webapps. Produces the test
   `published-contract/contract-id.txt`.
2. **Identity delegate** (`test-contract/identity/identity-manager-key.*.pem`) —
   P-384, used by the `identity-management` delegate. Stable across
   test runs so generated `identity-manager-params` is reproducible.

**To rotate the web-container test key:**

```bash
rm test-contract/web-container-keys.toml
cargo make generate-web-container-keys
cargo make update-published-contract   # regenerates contract-id.txt
git add test-contract/web-container-keys.toml published-contract/
git commit -m "chore: rotate committed web-container test key"
```

The test contract ID will change. CI `check-contract-wasm.yml` and any
Phase 3 Playwright tests that embed the contract ID will pick up the
new value automatically on next run.

**To rotate the identity delegate key:** delete the files under
`test-contract/identity/` and `modules/identity-management/build/identity-manager-params`,
then re-run `cargo make generate-identity-params`. This changes the
identity delegate's on-chain key, which is usually not what you want
unless you're reproducing a specific upstream change.

## End-to-end testing

### QA inventory

`docs/qa/manual-test-inventory.md` is the source of truth for what's
covered automatically vs what needs manual exercise. Consult it before
merging non-trivial UI/contract changes and update it when a test is
added or removed. The `freenet-mail-qa` skill at
`.claude/skills/freenet-mail-qa/SKILL.md` instructs agents on when and
how to use the matrix.

### Automated (Playwright)

The Playwright suite at `ui/tests/` tests the UI in offline mode
(`--features example-data,no-sync`) across 5 browser/viewport
profiles: Desktop Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Pixel 5, iPhone 13.

One-time setup:

```bash
cargo make test-ui-playwright-setup
```

Run the full suite (builds UI, starts dev server, runs tests, tears down):

```bash
cargo make test-ui-playwright
```

Or manually:

```bash
# Terminal 1: start the dev server
cd ui && dx serve --port 8082 --features example-data,no-sync --no-default-features

# Terminal 2: run tests
cd ui/tests && npx playwright test
```

The `example-data` feature seeds two identities (`address1`,
`address2`) with mock inboxes and supports in-memory message delivery
between them — no Freenet node required. The Playwright tests
exercise multi-turn cross-inbox messaging (compose → send → switch
identity → verify delivery → reply).

There's also `ui/tests/production-liveness.spec.ts`, a minimal
browser-loads-and-mounts check used by
`scripts/smoke-test-production.sh` against a deployed `use-node`
webapp. It deliberately doesn't exercise identity creation or
messaging — see `RELEASING.md` §"Post-release smoke test" for the
scope and the rationale.

### Automated real-node harness

`ui/tests/live-node.spec.ts` drives the real `use-node` build through
the AFT permission flow against the isolated 2-node network from
`scripts/run-isolated-nodes.sh`. One command runs the full pipeline:

```bash
cargo make test-e2e-real-node
```

This wipes any prior iso-node state, brings up gw (7510) + peer
(7511), publishes the webapp to the gw, then runs Playwright with
`FREENET_EMAIL_BASE_URL` pointing at the published contract URL.
The spec covers identity creation, reload-persistence, and (gated on
`FREENET_LIVE_E2E_SEND=1`) the send-via-address-book → AFT permission
→ inbox UPDATE round trip.

To leave the iso nodes up for inspection after the run:

```bash
FREENET_E2E_KEEP=1 cargo make test-e2e-real-node
cargo make iso-nodes-status
cargo make iso-nodes-down   # when done
```

The host's permission overlay is driven by polling
`/permission/pending` on the gateway and POSTing
`{"index": 0}` to `/permission/{nonce}/respond` — see the
`startPermissionPump` helper in the spec. This avoids coupling
to the gateway shell page's overlay HTML.

Log assertions tail `~/freenet-mail-iso/gw/logs/freenet.*.log`
(override via `FREENET_ISO_GW_LOG_DIR`) and grep for
`UPDATE_PROPAGATION`, `allocate_token`, and identity-management
markers. Day-1 AFT cap is dodged by wiping node data per run, so
single-identity self-send works for the first send of the run.

CI scope: this target is heavy (full freenet network + dx build
+ headed browser) and is intended for tags / nightly, not every PR.

### Manual E2E checklist (against a local node)

This checklist validates the pieces that unit tests and Playwright
can't cover: real WebSocket framing, real AFT token mint/burn, real
ML-KEM encapsulation + ChaCha20-Poly1305 round trip through the inbox
contract state.

1. `cargo make run-node` in one terminal
2. `cargo make publish-email-test` in another
3. Open the published webapp URL in the browser
4. Create identity A and identity B
5. As B, click "Share address" and copy the share text — bs58 inbox
   address (~44 chars) on its own line, optionally followed by a
   `verify: <six words>` fingerprint line for out-of-band verification (#249)
6. As A, click "+ Import contact", paste B's card, set a local label, click Import
7. A sends a message to B by typing the imported alias into the To field
   (the compose form should show a fingerprint badge once the alias resolves);
   sending burns an AFT token
8. B receives, decrypts, and reads the message
9. Token accounting check: A's remaining tokens decremented

Notes:
- Single-user identity creation only validates the inbox/AFT/encryption
  pipeline. Cross-identity messaging requires the address-book share/import
  flow because contact pubkeys are not auto-discovered yet (see issue #42).
- For two browsers / two nodes, use the iso-nodes harness from #41 and run
  steps 5–6 on each side.
