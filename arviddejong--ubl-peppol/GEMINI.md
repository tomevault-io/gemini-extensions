Specific to `darvis/ubl-peppol`. The shared conventions are in `~/Sites/Packages/CLAUDE.md`; only what differs or what this package adds is written here.

## Overview

Builds UBL 2.1 invoices and credit notes that pass PEPPOL BIS Billing 3.0 and EN 16931 validation, for the Netherlands and Belgium. It also validates European VAT numbers against VIES and company registration numbers such as the Dutch KvK number and the Belgian ondernemingsnummer, and can hand a finished document to a PEPPOL access point provider.

## Laravel is optional here

This is the one deliberate departure from the shared layout: `laravel/framework` is **not** a runtime requirement, only a dev dependency through Testbench. The package is a plain PHP library that happens to ship a Laravel layer.

Exactly four files may import `Illuminate\...`:

- `src/UblPeppolServiceProvider.php`
- `src/PeppolService.php`
- `src/Models/PeppolLog.php`
- `src/Console/CleanupPeppolLogsCommand.php`

`tests/Unit/StandaloneCoreTest.php` fails on an import anywhere else in `src/`, and it also checks that this list only names files that exist. If a file legitimately joins the Laravel layer, add it to the list in that test and say why in the pull request. Do not solve a failure by widening the rule.

`tests/Pest.php` therefore binds the Testbench `TestCase` only to `tests/Laravel`. Everything else runs without booting an application, which is both the point and the reason the suite is fast.

## Architecture

- `UblNlBis3Service` and `UblBeBis3Service` are separate classes on purpose: their checks and their method signatures differ: the Dutch `validate()` checks code formats and the NL-R rules, the Belgian one checks the totals. Never merge them behind a country flag. A fix in one is not automatically right in the other.
- Both builders build credit notes with the same four method names (`createCreditNoteDocument()`, `addCreditNoteHeader()`, `addBillingReference()`, `addCreditNoteLine()`), because a host app picks a builder per country and runs one code path over it: until 1.10.0 the Dutch builder lacked them and a Dutch credit note died with `Call to undefined method`. Never add a document level method to one builder under a name the other does not have. `<CreditNote>` has its own element order (`CREDIT_NOTE_ROOT_ELEMENT_ORDER`, copied from `UBL-CreditNote-2.1.xsd`): no `DueDate`, `AllowanceCharge` behind the exchange rates. Never sort a credit note with the invoice list.
- Elements are written in the order the UBL schema fixes. A document with correct values in the wrong order is rejected, and the receiver's error names the element, not the order, so this is the first thing to check when correct-looking XML fails. `UblNlBis3Service::arrangeInSchemaOrder()` sorts the children of `<Invoice>` when `generateXml()` runs, with a stable sort, so a document built in schema order comes out byte for byte as before; `tests/Unit/UblNlElementOrderTest.php` pins that. It matches on the node name, because `localName` is empty for an element made with `createElement()`. The Belgian builder only moves the totals in front of the lines.
- The builders write nothing the caller did not pass. Never hard code a value from the PEPPOL example files (`base-example.xml`) into a document: 1.9 and older wrote its `AccountingCost` and its supplier `RegistrationName` into every invoice, which a receiver books and stores as fact. An optional element gets its own `add...()` method (`addAccountingCost()`, BT-19).
- `PartyLegalEntity/CompanyID` (BT-30, BT-47) is the legal registration, not the VAT number. NL-R-003 and NL-R-005 test its `schemeID` for `0106` (KvK) or `0190` (OIN) on a Dutch party. The same goes for the customer's `PartyIdentification/cbc:ID` (BT-46): it is the seller's own name for the buyer, so it only carries the endpoint's scheme when `partyIdFitsScheme()` says so; PEPPOL-COMMON-R040 to R054 test the format of every identifier under a scheme, some of them fatally. Never write a value under scheme `0106` that is not a KvK number: the Schematron only checks the scheme, so nobody finds out until the receiver's bookkeeping does. The Dutch builder takes it through `addSupplierLegalRegistration()` and `addCustomerLegalRegistration()`; the party signatures could not change within 1.x. `tests/Unit/GeneratedValuesNlTest.php` and `GeneratedValuesBeTest.php` pin these values, each test named after its business term and rule.
- `Vat\VatCategory` and `Vat\VatExemptionReason` are the knowledge base on VAT categories and exemption reasons, and the builders use them: `addTaxTotal()` settles the reason through `UblValidator::resolveTaxExemption()` before it writes anything. Their names, codes and rules are copied from the official UNCL5305 and VATEX code lists and the EN 16931 Schematron; never write one from memory. The texts of a category that "the rules name" are the standard texts of BR-AE-10, BR-IC-10, BR-G-10 and BR-O-10. A category that needs a reason gets its one default code (`VATEX-EU-IC` for K) when the caller passes none: that code is fixed by the category (P0104 to P0107), so it is derived, not invented, which is why it does not break "write nothing the caller did not pass". Exempt (E) has no default, because the code names the article of the VAT directive and only the seller knows it. `UblValidator::validateVatCategories()` reads the finished document with XPath instead of tracking arguments, so it judges exactly what would be sent and both builders share one check; the DOM is serialised and reloaded first, because an element made with `createElement()` has no namespace for XPath. The exemption codes are deliberately not passed to the strict codelist check: a host app whose registry lacks the VATEX list would otherwise fail on a code it never chose.
- `examples/validate/generate_samples.php` writes the sample documents for the check against an official validator; see "Releases that change the generated XML" in `CONTRIBUTING.md`. Add a case there for every new element.
- `Validation\UblValidator` holds **static** helpers for single values (unit codes, currency, tax categories, IBAN, VAT format). Validating a whole document is the builder's `validate()`, which returns an `InvoiceValidationResult`.
- `Validation\CodelistRegistry` holds the code lists a host app loads for strict validation; the package ships none. `ValidationTrackingTrait` records the codes a builder used so `validate()` can check them. Nothing is ever corrected: `getCorrections()` returns the totals `UblValidator::validateInvoiceTotals()` suggests, only from the Belgian builder and only when the amounts do not add up.
- The `peppol_logs` table is opt-in: it arrives by publishing `--tag=ubl-peppol-migrations`, not through `loadMigrationsFrom`. Never write code that assumes the table exists: a host app that only wants to send would get a `QueryException` instead of a sent invoice, which is what 1.7 did. Everything that writes or deletes a log asks `PeppolLog::tableExists()` first; `tests/Laravel/PeppolSendingTest.php` sends with and without the table.

## The specification wins

Every rule comes from the [PEPPOL BIS Billing 3.0 specification](https://docs.peppol.eu/poacc/billing/3.0/bis/). When this file, the documentation or a test disagrees with that specification, the specification is right and we are wrong. Rule codes in a rejection (`BR-CO-11`, `PEPPOL-EN16931-R010`, national `NL-` and `BE-` prefixes) point straight at the paragraph that explains why.

`validate()` covers the rules this package implements, never the receiver's full Schematron. The official rules can also be run offline: the compiled `CEN-EN16931-UBL.xslt` and `PEPPOL-EN16931-UBL.xslt` of the current OpenPEPPOL release (the NL-R rules are inside the second) with Saxon, for example `npx xslt3 -xsl:PEPPOL-EN16931-UBL.xslt -s:invoice.xml`, and count the `svrl:failed-assert` elements. That is how the BT-46 scheme error was found, which the XSD and `validate()` both accept. Use it on real invoices too: nothing leaves the machine. Output is verified against an official validator ([Dutch](https://test.peppolautoriteit.nl/validate), [Ecosio](https://ecosio.com/en/peppol-and-xml-document-validator/)) before a release that changes the generated XML.

## Backwards compatibility

The usual rule that the public API stays stable within 1.x applies, and here the **generated XML is part of that API**. A document a receiver accepted before and rejects now is a breaking change, whatever the specification says about it. When a rule turns out to have been implemented wrongly, the fix is a minor release with the change spelled out in the CHANGELOG, not a patch.

## Static analysis

Larastan runs at level 8, with a `phpstan-baseline.neon` holding the errors that predate it. Nearly all of them are missing array value types in docblocks. The baseline exists so level 8 applies in full to new code; it is not a place to park a new error. When a change makes an entry disappear, regenerate it with `vendor/bin/phpstan analyse --generate-baseline` and the file shrinks. An empty baseline is the goal.

## Test data

Never put real customer data in a test, an example or an issue. The `examples/` directory keeps invented data in its own `test_data.php` per country for exactly this reason.
