# This Rails App

> `CLAUDE.md` is a symlink to this file — edit here, not there.

This Rails app is a Rails 8.1 web application built on the Hotwire stack (Turbo + Stimulus) with Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI. It currently provides authentication, session management, and multi-tenant account foundations.

These instructions are defaults with reasons, not law — when the code in front of you disagrees, take the better path and flag the conflict. Invariants (data loss, security, CI gates) are non-negotiable.

## The Half-Window Rule

**Core business logic must fit within half the context window of the model maintaining this codebase.**

The first 50% of context is for comprehension; the second 50% is for reasoning and generation. When code consumes the whole window, AI agents pattern-match instead of reason — subtle regressions multiply and fixes add code instead of refactoring.

The default failure mode is overproduction: unrestricted code generation creating complexity without customer value. Before adding a feature, ask whether it earns its tokens. Delete speculative abstractions. Refactor rather than append.

## Deploy

Default branch: `main`

Kamal deploys to Docker containers — see `.kamal/` for config. SQLite is the database in all environments; the `storage/` directory is a persistent Docker volume. Do not assume Postgres or MySQL conventions.

Production runs three separate SQLite databases: main (`production.sqlite3`), cache (`cache.sqlite3`), and queue (`queue.sqlite3`).

## Authentication

Custom Rails 8 authentication — no Devise, no Warden. The `Authentication` concern in `app/controllers/concerns/authentication.rb` is included in `ApplicationController` and enforces `require_authentication` globally. Controllers opt out with `allow_unauthenticated_access`.

Sessions are stored in signed cookies (`cookies.signed[:session_id]`). `Current.session` and `Current.user` (via `ActiveSupport::CurrentAttributes`) carry request-scoped identity. Rate limiting protects sign-in and password reset (10 requests per 3 minutes).

Do not introduce session or auth logic outside this concern.

## Multi-Tenancy

Users belong to Accounts. Accounts have a `slug` (unique, URL-friendly). The tenant routing shape is not yet implemented — the Account model is a foundation only. When building tenant-scoped features, scope all queries through the current account and avoid cross-tenant data access.

## Background Jobs

Solid Queue runs inside Puma (via `SOLID_QUEUE_IN_PUMA`). Jobs go in `app/jobs/`. The only scheduled job clears finished queue records hourly. Mailers use `deliver_later`.

## Frontend

Hotwire stack: Turbo Drive for navigation, Turbo Frames/Streams for partial updates, Stimulus for JavaScript behavior. No build step — importmap pins dependencies. Tailwind CSS with DaisyUI for styling.

Add Stimulus controllers in `app/javascript/controllers/`. Keep them thin; push logic to the server via Turbo.

## Icons

[Heroicons](https://heroicons.com/) via the `heroicon` gem is the standard icon library — DaisyUI does not ship icons. Default variant is `:outline` (set in `config/initializers/heroicon.rb`). Use the helper directly in views:

```erb
<%= heroicon "check", options: { class: "size-5" } %>
```

Override per-icon with `variant: :solid` or `variant: :mini` when needed.

## Testing

Minitest with fixtures and parallel execution. Tests live in `test/` mirroring `app/`. Use `SessionTestHelper` for authenticated controller tests. Run the full suite with `bin/rails test`.

## Coding Style

RuboCop with `rubocop-rails-omakase` enforces style. Run `bundle exec rubocop` before committing. Brakeman (`bundle exec brakeman`) and `bundle exec bundler-audit` are available for security checks.

## Development Practices

### Task Tracking

All tasks are managed in Basecamp. **Before writing any code, state which Basecamp task you are working on.**

Use the Basecamp CLI to read and update tasks during your session. If the CLI is not installed:

```
curl -fsSL https://basecamp.com/install-cli | bash
```

Typical workflow:
1. Pull the task to understand acceptance criteria before touching code.
2. Note the task ID in your first message when starting work.
3. Update the task status when work is complete or blocked.

### Skills

Install the `superpowers-rails` plugin if not already present:

```
/plugin install superpowers-rails@sneharavindra
```

Plugin source: https://github.com/sneharavindra/superpowers-rails

**Mandatory skills — invoke before the described action, not after:**

| Situation | Skill |
|-----------|-------|
| Starting any new feature or design decision | `/superpowers-rails:brainstorming` |
| Bug, test failure, or unexpected behavior | `/superpowers-rails:systematic-debugging` |
| Task complete or before merging to `main` | `/superpowers-rails:requesting-code-review` |

Never rationalize skipping a skill because the task feels small. If there is a 1% chance it applies, invoke it.

`daisyui` (`.claude/skills/daisyui/SKILL.md`, mirrored from https://daisyui.com/SKILL.md): DaisyUI 5 component/class reference — check it before writing any Tailwind/DaisyUI markup.

## Business Process Management with FOSM

This Rails app uses `fosm-rails` to model business objects that have a **lifecycle** — objects whose permitted operations depend on their current state. The engine is mounted at `/fosm`. FOSM apps live under `app/models/fosm/`, `app/controllers/fosm/`, `app/views/fosm/`, and `app/agents/fosm/`.

### When to use FOSM

Use FOSM for any model where the answer to "what can I do with this?" depends on where it currently is in its process. Examples: a form submission that moves from `draft → submitted → reviewed → accepted/rejected`, or a subscription that moves from `trial → active → cancelled`.

Do not use FOSM for:
- Stateless data (lookup tables, pure reference data)
- Simple boolean flags (`published: true/false`) with no lifecycle consequence
- UI-only toggles with no business rules attached
- Models where every operation is always available regardless of state

### The four primitives

Every FOSM lifecycle is built from exactly four building blocks:

| Primitive | Purpose | Rule |
|-----------|---------|------|
| `state` | A named position in the lifecycle | Exactly one `initial: true`; terminal states have no outgoing events |
| `event` | A named transition between states | Declares `from:` and `to:`; multiple `from:` states allowed |
| `guard` | A pure predicate that blocks an event | Returns `true` (allow) or `false` (block); no side effects inside guards |
| `side_effect` | Work that runs after the transition persists | Runs inside the same DB transaction; use for emails, webhooks, cascades |

### Bounded autonomy for AI agents

Every FOSM model automatically exposes a Gemlings AI agent. The agent is **bounded by the machine**: it can only fire events that exist in the lifecycle definition. It cannot bypass guards. It cannot invent transitions. Every action is written to the immutable `fosm_transition_logs` table.

This is the core design principle: the lifecycle definition is the contract between the domain and any actor — human UI, background job, or AI agent. The machine enforces it. The agent operates within it.

When writing FOSM lifecycle definitions, design for the agent as a first-class actor: name events clearly (`approve`, not `set_state_to_approved`), write guards that return meaningful error context, and keep side effects focused on one concern each.

### Architecture rules for FOSM models

- One lifecycle per model. Do not split lifecycle logic across concerns or callbacks.
- No business logic outside the `lifecycle` block. Guards and side effects own the rules.
- State is a string column named `state` on the model. Never read or write it directly — use events.
- Fire events with `record.event_name!(actor: current_user)` from controllers. Never set `record.state =` anywhere.
- RBAC: if the lifecycle has an `access` block, use `fosm_authorize!` in the controller. If not, the object is open-by-default for all authenticated actors.
- The `fosm_transition_logs` table is immutable. Never delete or update rows in it.
