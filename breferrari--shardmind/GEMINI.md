# ShardMind

Package manager for Obsidian vault templates. TypeScript, Pastel + Ink TUI, spec-driven development. The engine is agent-agnostic — shard content determines which AI agents are supported (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI).

## How This Repo Works

This project is **spec-driven**. The architecture and implementation are fully designed before code is written. Claude Code reads the specs and implements them.

### Source of Truth

| Document | What | When to Read |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `VISION.md` | Origin story, architectural bets, scope guardrails, non-goals. | Before proposing features or scope changes. |
| `ROADMAP.md` | v0.1 milestones linked to GitHub issues. Build order. | Before starting a new milestone. |
| **`docs/SHARD-LAYOUT.md`** | **v6 shard-layout contract + three binding invariants. Active design spec.** Folded into `ARCHITECTURE.md §3` and `IMPLEMENTATION.md §4.5` / `§4.5a` / `§4.5b` for the engine specs; this doc remains the canonical contract for the binding properties + author-facing layout. | Before implementing anything related to shard layout, install walk, hook context, adopt command, or obsidian-mind v6. Authoritative over ARCHITECTURE.md / IMPLEMENTATION.md where they conflict. |
| `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` | The what and why. 22 sections. Core concepts, ownership model, schema format, module system, values layer, signals, operations, competitive moat. | Before making any architectural decision. |
| `docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md` | The how, exactly. System diagram, data flows, module specs with TypeScript signatures, algorithms as numbered steps, error cases, 20 merge test fixtures, 6-day build plan. **§9 (Build Plan) is stale — see [#70](https://github.com/breferrari/shardmind/issues/70) for the current task list.** | Before implementing any module. |
| `docs/COMPONENTS.md` | Iterated UI patterns (A/B), `useOncePerKey` hook, `rerender()` regression-test convention. Codifies why state-machine-iterated prompts (`AdoptDiffView`, `DiffView`) need per-iteration ref scoping vs. boolean refs. | Before adding a new Ink component that may be iterated by a parent state machine, or before changing a `useRef` shape inside one. |
| `examples/minimal-shard/` | Minimal test shard for development. 4 values, 2 modules, signals. Flat v6 layout (`.shardmind/` sidecar, content at native paths, dotfolder `.njk` for rendering). | Use as a fixture for engine-level tests; obsidian-mind v6 conversion lands at Milestone 5. |

**Read the relevant spec section before writing code.** The specs define inputs, outputs, algorithms, error cases, and test expectations for every module. Don't improvise — implement what the spec says.

### Build Order

**Authoritative task list for v0.1: [#70](https://github.com/breferrari/shardmind/issues/70)** (engine changes, shard conversion, docs, tests, acceptance criteria). Spec for what to build: [`docs/SHARD-LAYOUT.md`](docs/SHARD-LAYOUT.md). The day-by-day rhythm in `docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md §9` is preserved below for cadence reference, but the specific sub-tasks within each day are superseded by #70's tracks (the `templates/` walk, `partials` field, and Cookiecutter-style source/target split described in §9 do not reflect the v6 contract).

| Day | Focus |
|-----|-------|
| 1 | Scaffold + core modules per #70 "Walk + discovery" and "Schema + values" tracks |
| 2 | Install command with full Ink wizard + module review + `--defaults` flag |
| 3 | Merge engine — TDD with 17 fixtures (write fixtures FIRST, then implement) |
| 4 | Update command + status display + verbose mode + ref re-resolution + `--version` / `--include-prerelease` |
| 5 | obsidian-mind v6 conversion (`.shardmind/` sidecar, dotfolder `.njk`, hooks) + `shardmind adopt` command |
| 6 | Research-wiki shard, Invariant 1 E2E test, polish, npm publish |

## Working Agreement (v6 execution standard)

Every v6 sub-issue (#73–#78, #14, #15, #85) passes these gates before merge. These practices are what this project has used from day one — spec-driven, fixture-first, adversarial. This section makes them explicit so any session picking up work knows the bar.

### 1. Spec before code

- Read the relevant section of [`docs/SHARD-LAYOUT.md`](docs/SHARD-LAYOUT.md) AND the linked issue body before touching code.
- If the spec is silent or ambiguous on a decision you need, **update the spec first via a separate commit** — do not invent behavior in the implementation.
- If your implementation reveals a spec mistake, fix the spec and submit the fix alongside the code change.

### 2. Tests before implementation

- Write the failing test first for every new behavior or bug fix. No code without a test.
- For merge-engine-class work (`drift.ts`, `differ.ts`, `renderer.ts`), write **fixtures first** — the pattern used for the 20 merge fixtures in `tests/fixtures/merge/`.
- Prefer property-based tests via `fast-check` when the input space is wide: ref-syntax parsing, `.shardmindignore` glob matching, hash-equivalence under whitespace.
- Right test type for the work: unit for pure functions in `source/core/*.ts`; component via `ink-testing-library` for `source/components/*.tsx`; integration for multi-module pipelines; E2E via `tests/e2e/cli.test.ts` spawning `dist/cli.js`.

### 3. Adversarial cases enumerated

Before coding, list adversarial scenarios in the issue thread or PR description. Every listed case gets a test. Starter enumeration per v0.1 track:

- **#73 walk**: symlinks pointing outside vault, paths with Unicode + spaces, missing `.shardmind/`, empty `.shardmind/`, `.shardmindignore` with thousands of patterns, tarball with Windows path separators.
- **#74 schema**: defaults of `null` / `""` / `0` / `false` / nested objects; required-without-default must reject at parse time.
- **#75 hooks**: hook crashes mid-edit (state.json must still reflect actual content), hook exceeds timeout, hook writes to unmanaged paths, `valuesAreDefaults` deep-equal vs. near-equal (whitespace, case, type coercion).
- **#76 update**: ref moves between install and update, tag force-moved upstream, non-existent ref, rate-limited GitHub API, `--release` + `--include-prerelease` combined, beta-only repos (no stable release).
- **#77 adopt**: adopt into dir with partial vault, adopt with existing `.shardmind/`, adopt with user files byte-equivalent to shard paths, adopt mid-failure recovery, adopt when shard can't be fetched.
- **#78 Invariant 1**: shard with all-defaults empty strings, shard with zero modules, `.shardmindignore` excluding everything, byte-equivalence on case-insensitive filesystems (macOS), clone of shard vs. install includes/excludes parity.

### 4. Quality gate (PR-merge requirements)

Every PR for a v6 issue must demonstrate in its description:

- [ ] `npm run typecheck` passes.
- [ ] `npm test` passes (all scopes).
- [ ] New behavior has new tests (§2) — no code without tests.
- [ ] Adversarial cases from §3 are enumerated and covered.
- [ ] Copilot review requested and addressed (or each flag explicitly justified as false-positive in PR conversation).
- [ ] Once [#78](https://github.com/breferrari/shardmind/issues/78) lands: Invariant 1 E2E test still green.
- [ ] Issue's acceptance criteria checked off with evidence.
- [ ] Roadmap checkbox updated in the same PR.

### 5. Session hygiene

- **Start**: read this file, then `ROADMAP.md` (find first unchecked), then the linked issue, then `docs/SHARD-LAYOUT.md` (relevant section). In that order. Don't skip ahead.
- **During**: run `npm run typecheck` and `npm test` frequently, not just at the end. If a test that should stay green goes red, stop and investigate before continuing — don't paper over.
- **End**: if work is complete, open a PR referencing the issue (`closes #N`) with the quality-gate evidence. If incomplete, push the branch and comment on the issue with where you stopped, why, and what blocks progress — so the next session can resume.

### 6. PR hygiene

- **One PR per issue** by default. Bundling multiple issues into one PR is discouraged — it tangles review, makes revert granularity worse, and confuses the roadmap-checkbox flow. If two issues are truly inseparable, comment on both issues explaining why before opening the combined PR.
- The quality-gate checklist above lives in [`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) and auto-populates every new PR. Don't delete items — check them or justify their absence.
- **Interim proxy for Invariant 1** while #73-#77 are in-flight: until [#78](https://github.com/breferrari/shardmind/issues/78) lands its CI test, each PR on #73-#77 should manually run `git clone <a fixture shard>` + `shardmind install --defaults` + `diff -r` and paste the result (or "no diff beyond Tier 1 + `.shardmind/` metadata") into the PR description.

### 7. Commit hygiene — step-by-step, never one mega-commit

- **A PR is a sequence of small, reviewable commits.** A single squashed commit on a multi-step change is a review-hostile artifact: reviewers can't bisect, can't read incrementally, can't revert the wrong piece. Always split.
- **Commit at every coherent step.** A new module + its tests is a step. A test sweep that migrates N existing tests to a new contract is a step. A docs update is a step. A fixture regeneration is a step. Don't batch unrelated steps; don't fragment the same step across commits.
- **Each commit must be self-consistent**: typecheck + the relevant test scope green at every commit. Reviewers (and `git bisect`) rely on this — a broken intermediate commit defeats the purpose. If a step needs a follow-up step to make tests green, fold them into the same commit.
- **Conventional-commit prefixes** (`feat:`, `fix:`, `test:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `chore:`). Subject ≤ 70 chars. Body explains *why* and links the issue. The issue tag goes in the *first* commit of the series; subsequent commits in the same PR don't repeat it unless they cite a sub-decision.
- **Recommended split shape** for engine work: (1) new pure module(s) + their unit tests, (2) wire-up to existing modules, (3) call-site migrations + test sweep, (4) fixtures / examples, (5) docs (CHANGELOG, ROADMAP). Five commits is normal for a v6 sub-issue PR; one commit is wrong.
- **Force-pushing the topic branch to fix history is fine** (and expected) before review starts. Once a reviewer has commented, prefer additive `fixup!` commits over rewriting their context. Auto-squash on merge if the maintainer prefers a squashed history at merge time — the *review* still happened against the granular series.

## Tech Stack

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Pastel** | CLI framework — file-system routing, zod arg parsing, Commander under the hood |
| **Ink** + **@inkjs/ui** | React terminal renderer + pre-built components |
| **React** | Required peer dep for Ink |
| **Nunjucks** | Template engine (`{{ }}` syntax). Config: `autoescape: false` |
| **yaml** (eemeli/yaml) | YAML parsing. TypeScript-typed, comment-preserving |
| **tar** (node-tar) | Tarball download + extraction |
| **semver** | Version parsing, range checking |
| **ignore** | gitignore-spec glob matcher for `.shardmindignore`. Negation pre-filtered by the wrapper (deferred to v0.2 per #87). |
| **tsx** | TypeScript loader for post-install / post-update hook subprocess execution |
| **zod** | Schema validation. Shared with Pastel for arg parsing |
| **diff** | Unified diff generation for update previews |
| **node-diff3** | Three-way merge (Khanna-Myers algorithm) |
| **vitest** | Test runner |
| **@sindresorhus/tsconfig** | Pastel's recommended TS config |

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

```bash
npm ci                # Install deps from lockfile (routine — see Lockfile discipline below)
npm install           # Only when adding/bumping a dep (run after `rm -rf node_modules`)
npm run build         # tsup build (cli + runtime)
npm run dev           # tsup watch mode
npm test              # vitest run (all tests)
npm run test:watch    # vitest watch
npm run test:merge    # just the merge engine fixtures
npm run typecheck     # tsc --noEmit
```

- If deps are missing or a command fails with "module not found", run `npm ci` first, then retry.
- Before pushing: `npm run typecheck && npm test` must both pass.
- Before publishing: `npm run build` must produce clean output in `dist/`.

### Lockfile discipline

Use `npm ci` for routine syncing after `git pull` — it installs exactly what the lockfile specifies and never mutates it. When adding or bumping a dep, always `rm -rf node_modules` before `npm install`: npm has a [known bug](https://github.com/npm/cli/issues/4828) that prunes non-host platform binaries (e.g. `@esbuild/*`, `@rolldown/binding-*`) from `package-lock.json` when regenerating with `node_modules/` present. Starting from a clean `node_modules` avoids the prune on every platform. CI runs `npm ci` on all matrix runners, so a lockfile missing platform variants will fail the Windows or macOS job loudly instead of silently.

## Coding Style

- **Language**: TypeScript, ESM, strict mode.
- **Formatting**: follow the existing style in the codebase. No formatter configured yet — consistency by convention.
- **No `any`** except in `source/core/schema.ts` and `source/runtime/values.ts` zod dynamic generation (documented in spec; the runtime copy is a necessary duplicate because `runtime/` can't import from `core/`). Prefer `unknown` + type narrowing everywhere else.
- **No `as unknown as` casts** in `source/` except in `source/commands/hooks/shared.ts::appendHookOutput` — the cast narrows the generic `P extends { kind: string }` to `RunningHookPhase` inside the `kind === 'running-hook'` branch. Both machines' Phase unions intersect `RunningHookPhase`, so the runtime is sound; the cast is what lets the helper be shared across install and update without exposing their internal phase shapes. Documented in place.
- **No `@ts-ignore` or `@ts-nocheck`**. Fix root causes. If a suppression is truly needed, comment why.
- **Prefer `zod`** for validation at external boundaries: shard.yaml parsing, values validation, CLI arg parsing (Pastel handles this).
- **Error handling**: throw `ShardMindError(message, code, hint)`. Commands catch and render via Ink `StatusMessage`. User errors get a message + hint. Engine errors get a full stack trace + "This is a bug, please report." See spec §7.
- **Imports**: use `.js` extension for local imports (ESM requirement). `import { foo } from './bar.js'`.
- **File references** in conversation: always repo-root relative (e.g., `source/core/renderer.ts:45`), never absolute paths.

## Module Boundaries

- `source/core/` — pure logic. No Ink, no React, no TUI. These modules are testable without rendering anything.
- `source/components/` — Ink/React components. Import from `core/` for logic.
- `source/commands/` — Pastel command files (.tsx). Thin orchestration: read args, call core, render components.
- `source/runtime/` — exported for hook scripts. **Zero dependency on Ink, React, or Pastel.** If you import from `ink` or `react` here, the build is broken.
- `source/internal/` — NOT public API. Contains the hook-runner subprocess entry (`hook-runner.ts`) that `core/hook.ts` spawns via `node --import tsx`. Must not be imported at module scope by anything in `source/`; only spawn-paths touch it. Exported from package.json's `exports` under `./internal/hook-runner` so `createRequire` can resolve it at runtime.
- `source/types/` — re-exports from `runtime/types.ts`. Both CLI and runtime import from here.

Do not cross these boundaries:
- Core must not import from components or commands.
- Runtime must not import from core, components, or commands.
- Components can import from core but not from commands.

## Naming

- **Files**: `kebab-case.ts` for core modules, `PascalCase.tsx` for React components.
- **Types/Interfaces**: `PascalCase` (e.g., `ShardManifest`, `DriftReport`).
- **Functions**: `camelCase` (e.g., `parseManifest`, `detectDrift`).
- **Constants**: `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` only for true constants (e.g., `DEFAULT_REGISTRY_URL`).
- **Zod schemas**: `PascalCase` + `Schema` suffix (e.g., `ShardManifestSchema`).

## Conventions

### Pastel/Ink Specific

- **`source/` not `src/`**. Pastel convention. Don't fight it.
- **`.tsx` for commands and components**. `.ts` for everything else.
- **Follow `@sindresorhus/tsconfig`**. It's configured in `tsconfig.json`.
- **One file per command** in `source/commands/`. File name = CLI command name. `index.tsx` = root command (no args).
- **Export `args` and `options` as zod schemas** from command files. Pastel uses them for arg parsing + help generation.
- **React hooks** are fine in components. Keep state minimal — most logic should be in core modules.
- **`<Static>` for completed items**, `<Box>` for live content. See Ink docs for the distinction.

### One File Per Core Module

Each file in `source/core/` maps 1:1 to a section in `docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md`:

Read the spec section before implementing. It has inputs, outputs, algorithm steps, error cases, and test expectations.

### Testing

- **Fixtures before code** for the merge engine. Write all 17 fixture directories (see spec §19.2), then implement until they pass. TDD is mandatory for `drift.ts` and `differ.ts`.
- **Unit tests** for pure functions in `source/core/`. Test files: `tests/unit/<module>.test.ts`.
- **Component tests** for Ink components via `ink-testing-library`. Files: `tests/component/<Component>.test.tsx`.
- **Iterated-component regression tests are mandatory.** If a component is rendered inside a parent's iteration loop (state machine advances `phase.currentIndex`, `setIndex`, etc.) without a `key` prop forcing remount, its component test MUST include a `rerender()` case asserting the next iteration's interaction fires. Rationale: see [`docs/COMPONENTS.md`](docs/COMPONENTS.md) (Pattern B) — [#109](https://github.com/breferrari/shardmind/issues/109) shipped because `AdoptDiffView` and `DiffView` had only single-mount tests; the iteration-shape bug lived in the gap.
- **Layer 1 TUI flow tests are mandatory** for new commands or major flow changes to existing commands. Each new command (or flow change) gets a `tests/component/flows/<command>-flow.test.tsx` file in the same PR. Layer 1 mounts the whole command React tree via `ink-testing-library` and drives stdin end-to-end against the local GitHub stub — the same surface that #103 (wizard select-Enter freeze) and #109 (iterated diff freeze) fell through. Rationale: per-component tests verify single-mount behavior; only Layer 1 covers the production-shape iteration. See [#111](https://github.com/breferrari/shardmind/issues/111) Phase 1.
- **Layer 2 real-PTY tests are added when a bug needs real-terminal semantics** (SIGINT delivery, ANSI rendering, raw-mode keystroke handling, or live stdout streaming during `running-hook`) to manifest. Layer 2 lives under `tests/e2e/tui/` and spawns `dist/cli.js` inside a `node-pty` pseudoterminal, rendering the byte stream through `@xterm/headless`. Use Layer 1 by default — it's faster and covers most regressions; reach for Layer 2 only when the bug surface requires the kernel signal pipe, the actual TTY raw-mode path, or incremental terminal rendering. macOS + Linux only; Windows is skipped at the `it.skipIf` level (ConPTY divergence — tracked via [#57](https://github.com/breferrari/shardmind/issues/57)). See [#111](https://github.com/breferrari/shardmind/issues/111) Phase 2 + `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md §19.7`.
- **Integration tests** for pipelines: install (temp dir → full vault), update (install → modify → update → verify).
- **E2E tests** for CLI: spawn `dist/cli.js` as a subprocess via `node:child_process` and route through the local GitHub stub (`tests/e2e/helpers/github-stub.ts`). No `execa` dependency; no public network. See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md §19.7` for the hermetic-E2E methodology.
- Each merge fixture is a self-contained directory with `scenario.yaml`, template files, values files, actual file, and expected output. See `tests/fixtures/merge/01-managed-no-change/` for the pattern.
- **Clean up after tests**: remove temp dirs, don't leak state between tests.
- Run `npm test` before committing. It must be green. In CI, `npm run build` runs before `npm test` so the E2E suite has `dist/cli.js` to spawn.

### Commits

See [`§Working Agreement §7 — Commit hygiene`](#7-commit-hygiene--step-by-step-never-one-mega-commit) for the binding rule. Quick reference:

- Conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `test:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `chore:`.
- **Step-by-step always — never one mega-commit on a multi-step PR.** Splitting is what makes a PR reviewable; squashing is the maintainer's call at merge time.
- Each commit must be self-consistent: typecheck + relevant tests green at every commit.
- Reference the GitHub issue in the *first* commit of a PR series; subsequent commits cite the issue only when introducing a sub-decision.

## Key Architectural Decisions

These are documented fully in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`. Quick reference:

| Decision | Choice | Why |
|----------|--------|-----|
| Template engine | Nunjucks | `{{ }}` syntax familiarity. Shard authors know it. |
| CLI framework | Pastel | File-system routing + zod + Commander + Ink. One framework. |
| Three-way merge | node-diff3 | Battle-tested Khanna-Myers. Same approach as git. |
| State locality | Vault-local (.shardmind/) | Same model as git. No global state. |
| Values vs modules | Separate concerns | Values = file content. Modules = file existence. |
| 4 values, 3 commands | Convention over configuration | Obsidian handles unused features gracefully. |
| TypeScript hooks | Unified stack | One language. Hooks import `shardmind/runtime`. |
| Dependencies | Vendored in v0.1 | Shard authors bundle deps. Validated, not fetched. |
| Hook contract | Non-fatal | Hooks enhance but can't break install. Helm pattern. |

## Runtime Module

`shardmind/runtime` is a separately bundled entry point for hook scripts. It has zero dependency on Ink, React, Pastel, or CLI code. ~30KB.

```typescript
import { loadValues, loadState, validateFrontmatter } from 'shardmind/runtime';
```

Build isolation via tsup:

```typescript
// tsup.config.ts
export default {
  entry: {
    cli: 'source/cli.ts',
    'runtime/index': 'source/runtime/index.ts',
  },
  format: ['esm'],
  dts: true,
  splitting: true,  // shared chunks for yaml/zod
};
```

## Package Exports

```json
{
  "name": "shardmind",
  "exports": {
    ".": "./dist/cli.js",
    "./runtime": "./dist/runtime/index.js"
  }
}
```

## Release Process

**Binding gate:** Do not run `npm run release:*` until the smoke checklist in [`RELEASE-SMOKE.md`](RELEASE-SMOKE.md) has been completed against the packed-tarball CLI at the release SHA. After the `release.yml` workflow publishes the GitHub Release, append the saved smoke result table to the v\<version> release notes as a mandatory post-step. CI green is necessary, not sufficient — two consecutive 0.1.x patches ([#103](https://github.com/breferrari/shardmind/issues/103), [#109](https://github.com/breferrari/shardmind/issues/109)) shipped green and broke the flagship install on day one.

**Cadence:** [`RELEASE-SMOKE.md §Release cadence`](RELEASE-SMOKE.md#release-cadence) defines which v0.1.x patches batch together (hotfix / UX / foundation). Consult it before tagging — it answers "is this its own patch or does it ride with the next bundle?".

```bash
# 1. Update CHANGELOG.md: move [Unreleased] items to a new version section
# 2. Run RELEASE-SMOKE.md end-to-end against the release SHA
# 3. Bump version + tag + push:
npm run release:patch    # 0.1.0 → 0.1.1
npm run release:minor    # 0.1.0 → 0.2.0
npm run release:major    # 0.1.0 → 1.0.0
# 4. After the workflow publishes, paste the smoke result table into the
#    v<version> release tag body via the GitHub UI or `gh release edit`.
```

This triggers `.github/workflows/release.yml`:
- Runs typecheck + test + build
- Publishes to npm with provenance
- Creates GitHub Release with changelog from commits since last tag

**Do not** publish manually with `npm publish`. Always tag and let CI handle it.

## What NOT to Do

- Don't add features not in the spec. If something seems missing, check the spec first — it might be intentionally deferred (see §21 Deferred Items).
- Don't use `any` without documenting why.
- Don't modify `.shardmind/` directory structure without updating the state.ts module and spec.
- Don't add dependencies without checking the spec's dependency list.
- Don't write the merge engine without writing fixtures first. TDD is mandatory for `drift.ts` and `differ.ts`.
- Don't fight Pastel's conventions (source/ not src/, tsx for commands).
