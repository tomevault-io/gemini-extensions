## Project

**kuri** — a URI/URL parsing and manipulation library for Java and Kotlin.

## Current state

kuri is an implemented **Kotlin Multiplatform** library (no longer greenfield), built as three
Gradle modules (declared in `settings.gradle.kts`) that all apply the full quality-gate stack
(ktlint, detekt, explicit-API strict mode, binary-compatibility-validator, Kover):

- **`:kuri`** — the core engine and the only module published to every target (see
  **Targets** below). Source lives under `src/commonMain` — a pure-Kotlin parsing engine with
  `host`/`idna`/`percent`/`query`/`scheme`/`serialize`/`parser` subpackages — with tests in
  `src/commonTest` and JVM-interop tests in `src/jvmTest`.
- **`:kuri-bind`** — a JVM-only reflective annotation binder (`@Url`/`@Uri` roots → `Url`/`Uri`
  builders) that depends on `:kuri`.
- **`:kuri-serde-kotlinx`** — a `kotlinx.serialization` bridge (`Url`/`Uri` serializers, a
  query-parameters format) that depends on `:kuri`; multiplatform across the same
  jvm/js/wasmJs/native targets as `:kuri`, but does not publish an Android variant.

`:kuri-bind` and `:kuri-serde-kotlinx` each pin their own Java-8-bytecode toolchain override
(`jvmTarget = JVM_1_8` / `-Xjdk-release=1.8` / `sourceCompatibility`/`targetCompatibility` — see
**Toolchain** below) that must be kept in sync with `:kuri`'s. A Gradle (Kotlin DSL) build with
the `gradlew` wrapper is committed and drives all three modules.

- **Build & test:** `./gradlew build` runs the whole gate across every module and target. For
  a fast inner loop, scope to a module and the JVM target, e.g. `./gradlew :kuri:jvmTest
  :kuri:ktlintCheck :kuri:detekt :kuri:apiCheck` (swap the `:kuri` prefix for `:kuri-bind` or
  `:kuri-serde-kotlinx` to run the same gate on those modules). The JS/Wasm suites run on Node
  via `:kuri:jsNodeTest` / `:kuri:wasmJsNodeTest` and their `:kuri-serde-kotlinx` equivalents;
  `:kuri-bind` has no JS/Wasm/native tasks since it only targets the JVM.
- **Targets (`:kuri`):** `jvm` (Java 8 bytecode), `android` (namespace `org.dexpace.kuri`,
  `compileSdk = 35`, `minSdk = 21`, published as its own Maven variant), `js` and `wasmJs`
  (browser + Node), and native — `linuxX64`/`linuxArm64`, `macosArm64`, `mingwX64`,
  `iosX64`/`iosArm64`/`iosSimulatorArm64`, `watchosArm64`/`watchosSimulatorArm64`, and
  `tvosArm64`/`tvosSimulatorArm64`. The Android Gradle KMP library plugin doesn't auto-wire
  `apiCheck`/`apiDump` for its single-variant `android` target (upstream gap KT-71172), so
  `kuri/build.gradle.kts` hand-registers `androidApiBuild`/`androidApiCheck`/`androidApiDump`
  tasks against the `kuri/api/android/kuri.api` snapshot and hooks them into the normal
  `apiCheck`/`apiDump` aggregates — a public-API change still means running `apiDump` and
  committing the regenerated snapshot like any other target, but the wiring behind it is
  manual rather than BCV's usual auto-configuration.

The docs can still lag the code — when a detail matters, confirm it against the actual
`kuri/build.gradle.kts` and `gradle/libs.versions.toml` rather than assuming.

## Toolchain

- **Build JDK:** Corretto 21 (the JDK the build runs on, pinned via
  `gradle/gradle-daemon-jvm.properties` and used by every CI workflow); the JVM target pins
  `jvmToolchain(21)` for compilation.
- **Kotlin:** 2.4.0, with language/API version pinned to **2.0** (Kotlin 2.4 dropped 1.9
  support, so 2.0 is the floor the library compiles against).
- **JVM bytecode target:** 1.8 — enforced via `jvmTarget = JVM_1_8` and `-Xjdk-release=1.8`
  so newer-JDK stdlib symbols cannot leak into a library that must run on Java 8. Keep this
  in mind for a published library: avoid APIs unavailable on the Java 8 runtime in shipped
  code (`InputStream.transferTo` (9+), `Thread.threadId()` (19+), records, sealed `permits`,
  etc.).
- **Cross-compile toolchain discipline:** a module that genuinely needs a newer JDK must
  override **all three** of `jvmToolchain(N)`, the `java { sourceCompatibility /
  targetCompatibility }` block, and `compilerOptions { jvmTarget.set(JvmTarget.JVM_N) }`.
  Overriding only the toolchain emits Java-8-format bytecode that references newer stdlib
  symbols (`NoSuchMethodError` on JDK 8).

## Target build setup & conventions

kuri sits in the **Dexpace** family alongside `dexpace/java-sdk`, which it mirrors. These
conventions are wired into the build and are authoritative:

- **Build tool:** Gradle (Kotlin DSL). `gradle/libs.versions.toml` is the single source of
  truth for dependency and plugin versions. Group `org.dexpace`.
- **Quality gates wired into `check` (all break the build):** `ktlint` + `detekt`,
  `allWarningsAsErrors`, **explicit-API strict mode**, **binary-compatibility-validator**
  (`apiCheck`/`apiDump`), and a Kover line-coverage floor. Run `./gradlew build` to execute
  the full gate; `./gradlew apiDump` only after an **intentional** public-API change, and
  commit the regenerated `api/*.api` snapshots alongside it. Regenerate the native
  `kuri/api/kuri.klib.api` dump on **macOS**: running `apiDump` on a Linux/Windows host
  silently drops the Apple klib targets from the merged dump. The Linux `apiCheck` can't
  see that truncation, but the macOS `native` CI leg runs `klibApiCheck` and fails on it, so
  a dump regenerated on the wrong host is caught in CI rather than merged.
- **MIT license header in every source file** — each `.kt`/`.java`/`.kts` starts with the
  `Copyright (c) 2026 dexpace and Omar Aljarrah` / `SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT` block.
  This is a review convention; nothing enforces it automatically.
- **Java interop is first-class.** Immutable data uses a **private constructor + `Builder`
  + `newBuilder()`** (pre-filled), with `@JvmOverloads`/`@JvmStatic` for ergonomic Java
  call sites. Public declarations need explicit visibility and explicit return types
  (explicit-API strict mode); use `internal` for cross-package impl details,
  `@JvmSynthetic internal` when the mangled name would still be Java-callable, `private`
  otherwise.
- **Concurrency:** prefer `ReentrantLock` (`lock.withLock { … }`) over `synchronized`
  (synchronized pins carrier threads under Loom). Blocking calls must respect
  `Thread.interrupt()` — catch `InterruptedException`, restore the interrupt flag, and
  throw `InterruptedIOException` (or attach the interrupt as suppressed).
- **Commit style:** `feat:` / `fix:` / `docs:` / `test:` / `chore:` / `perf:` / `refactor:` /
  `ci:` / `build:` / `style:` / `revert:` prefixes (`merge:` for merge commits), enforced by
  `.github/scripts/check-conventional-commit.sh`. **PR titles follow the same prefixed style**
  (e.g. `docs: add CLAUDE.md`).

## Generated data & codegen

The IDNA/UTS-46 and NFC lookup tables (`…/idna/IdnaMappingTableData.kt`,
`IdnaValidityData.kt`, `NfcData.kt`) and the conformance fixtures
(`IdnaConformanceData.kt`, `IdnaConformanceKnownFailures.kt`, `NfcTestData.kt`) are
**generated, never hand-edited**. Generators are Go under `tools/`; regenerate via the
`codegen`-group Gradle tasks — `./gradlew generateFixtures` (or one of
`generateIdnaMappingTable` / `generateIdnaValidityTables` / `generateNfcTables` /
`generateNfcTestFixture` / `generateIdnaConformanceFixture`). They need a Go toolchain
(override with `-Pgo=/path/to/go`) and read the vendored UCD + WPT corpora under
`.claude/references/` (untracked).

- **`idnaref` lock-step (ratchet):** `IdnaConformanceKnownFailures.kt` is *derived* by running
  `tools/internal/idnaref` (a Go port of `Idna.domainToAscii`) over the WPT corpora, and
  `IdnaConformanceTest` asserts the live failing set equals it. **Any change to the runtime IDNA
  engine must be mirrored in `tools/internal/idnaref` and the baseline regenerated**, or the build
  breaks — keep the Kotlin runtime and the Go reference behaviorally identical.
- **Bundled Unicode version** is pinned by the single `unicodeVersionDir` constant in
  `tools/internal/ucd/ucd.go`; only the generated tables are committed (not the UCD sources). Full
  bump procedure: `docs/idna-unicode-update.md`.

## Repo gotchas

- **`.claude/` is untracked but NOT gitignored** (it holds multi-MB vendored UCD/WPT/reference data).
  Never `git add -A` / `git add .` — stage intended files by path only.
- `gh issue view` fails here (Projects-classic GraphQL deprecation); use
  `gh api repos/:owner/:repo/issues/<n>` instead.

## Design notes

- The library targets **both Java and Kotlin consumers**. When the public API is
  introduced, keep it idiomatic and ergonomic from Java (e.g. avoid Kotlin-only
  constructs in the public surface where they degrade the Java experience).

## Code style

All code follows the **Dexpace styleguide**: https://github.com/dexpace/styleguide
(Kotlin rules: https://github.com/dexpace/styleguide/tree/main/kotlin). The styleguide is
authoritative — consult it when a rule below is ambiguous. It also includes cross-cutting
guides for Security, Performance, and Git & Code Review.

Concern ordering, used to resolve conflicts: **correctness > performance > developer
experience**. Style priorities (in order): clarity, simplicity, concision,
maintainability, consistency (tiebreaker).

### Universal rules (apply everywhere)

- **Data + functions, not objects** — prefer `data class` records and top-level/extension
  functions over inheritance hierarchies.
- **Explicit over implicit** — no hidden control flow, reflection, framework magic, or
  global mutable state in new code; all dependencies visible.
- **Immutable by default** — `val` over `var`; return new values; expose read-only
  collections in public APIs.
- **Errors are values** — cover every error path; wrap with context at boundaries.
- **Composition over inheritance** — pipelines and `by` delegation, not class hierarchies.
- **Transform, don't mutate** — pure functions: input in, output out.
- **Always say why** — comments explain rationale, not mechanics.
- **Assert aggressively** — average ≥2 assertions per function (preconditions,
  postconditions, invariants).
- **Limits on everything** — fixed bounds on loops, retries, queues, buffers, timeouts.
- **Small functions** — one thing each; **60-line hard cap**, target 15–30 lines.
- **Performance from the outset** — optimize the slowest resource at design time.
- **Zero technical debt** — "perfection over technical debt — debt never gets paid."
- Don't mix styles within a package; refactor at module level or larger.

### Kotlin specifics

- **Formatting & tooling:** `ktlint` formats, `detekt` lints, both gating CI; config in
  `.editorconfig`, tool versions pinned via the Gradle version catalog. **120-column** hard
  line limit. Explicit imports only (no wildcards). Trailing commas allowed everywhere.
  Expression bodies only for single-expression functions. Braces on conditionals except
  single-line `val y = if (x) a else b`.
- **Naming:** `camelCase` members, `PascalCase` types, `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` const/value
  constants; acronyms as words (`httpClient`). Scope-proportional names. `is/has/should`
  for booleans; nouns for state, verbs for actions. No Hungarian/`I*` prefixes, no
  `*Manager`/`*Helper`/`*Util`. Backticked identifiers only in test names. Packages
  lowercase, structured by feature not layer.
- **Nullability:** non-null default; **`!!` is banned** (outside `main`, tests, justified
  Java bridges). Resolve at the boundary; prefer `?:` with meaningful defaults, smart
  casts, and `requireNotNull`/`checkNotNull` over manual throws. `lateinit` only for
  framework injection; `by lazy` for self-driven init. No `java.util.Optional` — use `T?`.
- **Declarations:** one per line; `const val` for compile-time constants only; limit
  `companion object` to constants/factories (utilities go top-level); explicit types on
  public/protected signatures, infer locally.
- **Data modeling:** `data class` (all-`val`) for value types; `@JvmInline value class`
  for IDs/wrappers (never `typealias`); `sealed` hierarchies for closed polymorphism with
  exhaustive `when` (no `else`); `object` for singletons; never `open` without a documented
  inheritance contract; default to `internal` visibility.
- **Error handling:** domain failures are sealed ADTs via a project-defined
  `Result<T, E>` (`Ok`/`Err`), **not** `kotlin.Result`. Exceptions only for unrecoverable
  failures, programmer errors, external faults; never catch bare `Exception`/`Throwable`.
  `require`/`check`/`error` for assertions; translate foreign exceptions at module
  boundaries; `runCatching` only at adapters (rethrow `CancellationException`).
- **API design:** narrowest visibility that compiles; small consumer-driven interfaces
  (`fun interface` for SAM); declaration-site variance (`out`/`in`); default + named args
  over builders for ≤7 params; explicit public return types; `@RequiresOptIn` for unstable
  APIs; read-only collections in/out; `suspend` for coroutine callers only (bridge Java
  with `CompletableFuture`).
- **Testing:** backticked sentence names (`<action> <expected> when <condition>`);
  arrange/act/assert; one concern per test; independent and parallel-safe; fakes/builders
  over shared `lateinit`; mock only at real seams (network, DB, clock); `@ParameterizedTest`
  / Kotest `withData` for tables; inject `Clock`/`Random`/ID sources; `runTest` (no
  `Thread.sleep`); fluent assertions (AssertJ/Kotest) with context.
- **Documentation:** KDoc on every `public` symbol (summary, body, then `@param`/`@return`/
  `@throws`/`@sample`/`@see`); document *why*, nullable/`Result` returns, and every
  deliberately thrown exception; `package.md` per public package; `@Deprecated` with
  `ReplaceWith` and a removal version.
