# Cursor Development Rules & AI Collaboration Guide
 
## 📜 Core Philosophy
 
1.  **Simplicity:** Prioritize simple, clear, and maintainable solutions. Avoid unnecessary complexity or over-engineering.
2.  **Iterate:** Prefer iterating on existing, working code rather than building entirely new solutions from scratch, unless fundamentally necessary or explicitly requested.
3.  **Focus:** Concentrate efforts on the specific task assigned. Avoid unrelated changes or scope creep.
4.  **Quality:** Strive for a clean, organized, well-tested, and secure codebase.
5.  **Collaboration:** This document guides both human developers and the AI assistant for effective teamwork.
 
## 📚 Project Context & Understanding
 
1.  **Documentation First:**
    *   **Always** check for and thoroughly review relevant project documentation *before* starting any task. This includes:
        *   Product Requirements Documents (PRDs)
        *   `README.md` (Project overview, setup, patterns, technology stack)
    *   If documentation is missing, unclear, or conflicts with the request, **ask for clarification**.
2.  **Architecture Adherence:**
    *   Validate that changes comply with the established architecture. Warn and propose compliant solutions if a violation is detected.
3.  **Pattern & Tech Stack Awareness:**
    *   Exhaust options using existing implementations before proposing new patterns or libraries.
 
## ⚙️ Task Execution & Workflow
 
1.  **Task Definition:**
    *   Clearly understand the task requirements, acceptance criteria.
2.  **Systematic Change Protocol:** Before making significant changes:
    *   **Identify Impact:** Determine affected components, dependencies, and potential side effects.
    *   **Plan:** Outline the steps. Tackle one logical change or file at a time.
    *   **Verify Testing:** Confirm how the change will be tested. Add tests if necessary *before* implementing (see TDD).

## 🤖 AI Collaboration & Prompting
 
1.  **Clarity is Key:** Provide clear, specific, and unambiguous instructions to the AI. Define the desired outcome, constraints, and context.
2.  **Context Referencing:** If a task spans multiple interactions, explicitly remind the AI of relevant previous context, decisions, or code snippets.
3.  **Suggest vs. Apply:** Clearly state whether the AI should *suggest* a change for human review or *apply* a change directly (use only when high confidence and task is well-defined). Use prefixes like "Suggestion:" or "Applying fix:".
4.  **Question AI Output:** Human developers should critically review AI-generated code. Question assumptions, verify logic, and don't blindly trust confident-sounding but potentially incorrect suggestions (hallucinations).
5.  **Focus the AI:** Guide the AI to work on specific, focused parts of the task. Avoid overly broad requests that might lead to architectural or logical errors.
6.  **Leverage Strengths:** Use the AI for tasks it excels at (boilerplate generation, refactoring specific patterns, finding syntax errors, generating test cases) but maintain human oversight for complex logic, architecture, and security.
7.  **Incremental Interaction:** Break down complex tasks into smaller steps for the AI. Review and confirm each step before proceeding.
8.  **Standard Check-in (for AI on large tasks):** Before providing significant code suggestions:
    *   "Confirming understanding: I've reviewed [specific document/previous context]. The goal is [task goal], adhering to [key pattern/constraint]. Proceeding with [planned step]." (This replaces the more robotic "STOP AND VERIFY").
 
## ✨ Code Quality & Style
 
2.  **Readability & Maintainability:** Write clean, well-organized code.
3.  **Small Files & Components:**
    *   Keep files under **300 lines**. Refactor proactively.
    *   Break down large React components into smaller, single-responsibility components.
4.  **Avoid Duplication (DRY):** Actively look for and reuse existing functionality. Refactor to eliminate duplication.
5.  **No Bazel:** Bazel is not permitted. Use project-specified build tools.
6.  **Linting/Formatting:** Ensure all code conforms to project's ESLint/Prettier rules.
7.  **Pattern Consistency:** Adhere to established project patterns. Don't introduce new ones without discussion/explicit instruction. If replacing an old pattern, ensure the old implementation is fully removed.
8.  **File Naming:** Use clear, descriptive names. Avoid "temp", "refactored", "improved", etc., in permanent file names.
9.  **No One-Time Scripts:** Do not commit one-time utility scripts into the main codebase.
 
## ♻️ Refactoring
 
1.  **Purposeful Refactoring:** Refactor to improve clarity, reduce duplication, simplify complexity, or adhere to architectural goals.
2.  **Holistic Check:** When refactoring, look for duplicate code, similar components/files, and opportunities for consolidation across the affected area.
3.  **Edit, Don't Copy:** Modify existing files directly. Do not duplicate files and rename them (e.g., `component-v2.js`).
4.  **Verify Integrations:** After refactoring, ensure all callers, dependencies, and integration points function correctly. Run relevant tests.
 
## ✅ Testing & Validation
 
1.  **Test-Driven Development (TDD):**
    *   **New Features:** Outline tests, write failing tests, implement code, refactor.
    *   **Bug Fixes:** Write a test reproducing the bug *before* fixing it.
2.  **Comprehensive Tests:** Write thorough unit, integration, and/or end-to-end tests covering critical paths, edge cases, and major functionality.
3.  **Tests Must Pass:** All tests **must** pass before committing or considering a task complete. Notify the human developer immediately if tests fail and cannot be easily fixed.
4.  **No Mock Data (Except Tests):** Use mock data *only* within test environments. Development and production should use real or realistic data sources.
5.  **Manual Verification:** Supplement automated tests with manual checks where appropriate, especially for UI changes.
 
## 🐛 Debugging & Troubleshooting
 
1.  **Fix the Root Cause:** Prioritize fixing the underlying issue causing an error, rather than just masking or handling it, unless a temporary workaround is explicitly agreed upon.
2.  **Console/Log Analysis:** Always check browser and server console output for errors, warnings, or relevant logs after making changes or when debugging. Report findings.
3.  **Targeted Logging:** For persistent or complex issues, add specific `console.log` statements (or use a project logger) to trace execution and variable states. *Remember to check the output.*
 
## 🔒 Security
 
2.  **Input Sanitization/Validation:** Always sanitize and validate user input on the server-side.
3.  **Dependency Awareness:** Be mindful of the security implications of adding or updating dependencies.

 
 
## 📄 Documentation Maintenance
 
1.  **Update Docs:** If code changes impact architecture, technical decisions, established patterns, or task status, update the relevant documentation (`README.md`).
2.  **Keep Rules Updated:** This `.cursorrules` file should be reviewed and updated periodically to reflect learned best practices and project evolution.
