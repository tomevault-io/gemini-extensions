Instructions for AI agents working in, or operating, this repository.

## What this is

`gateway` is a single-binary Rust HTTP gateway that lets coding agents use any
model provider through the protocol each client already speaks:

- **Claude Code** connects to an Anthropic Messages-compatible front door
  (`/anthropic/v1/messages`, alias `/v1/messages`)
- **Codex CLI** connects to an OpenAI Responses-compatible front door
  (`/openai/v1/responses`, alias `/v1/responses`)

Upstream providers speak either the Anthropic protocol or OpenAI Chat
Completions. The gateway translates bodies and streams in both directions,
routes by capability, and falls back conservatively: **never after output has
started streaming, never mid-tool-call**. That property is the reason this
project exists; do not weaken it.

## Build, test, run

```bash
cargo build                 # debug build
cargo test                  # all tests (unit + integration, no network needed)
cargo clippy --all-targets  # keep clippy clean
cargo run -- --config ./gateway.yaml   # run (default config path: ./gateway.yaml)
```

- Integration tests in `tests/integration.rs` spin up mock upstreams on
  ephemeral ports; they need no API keys or network.
- The server binds `127.0.0.1:4000` by default and also serves `[::1]`
  (Node clients resolve `localhost` to IPv6 first — do not remove this).
- `.env.local` / `.env` are auto-loaded at startup (existing env wins).

## Code map

```text
src/main.rs      CLI, env loading, bind safety (no public bind without tokens)
src/schema.rs    user-facing YAML format -> compiles into internal config
                 (provider presets, model quirk table, role/alias generation)
src/config.rs    internal routing config: models, routes, capabilities, glob map
src/classify.rs  request feature detection + route eligibility
src/http.rs      front doors, auth, route selection, attempt/fallback loop
src/translate.rs body translation (Anthropic Messages is the pivot format)
src/stream.rs    SSE parsing + stream translation state machines
src/error.rs     protocol-shaped errors; upstream errors forwarded verbatim
```

Request flow: front door → auth → resolve model name (exact → glob map →
unknown handling) → classify request features → filter eligible routes →
attempt loop (retry/fallback only before streaming) → translate body/stream
back to the client protocol.

## Configuration model

`gateway.yaml` has four sections; the file itself is the reference (it carries
commented examples of every option).

- `models:` is the single naming authority. `name: provider/model-id`, a list
  for a fallback chain, or a long form for capability overrides. The name is
  the model id clients use, verbatim, on both front doors.
- `clients:` maps traffic to models per client. Roles: `main`, `subagent`
  (Claude Code Task-tool requests, which pin `claude-opus-*` ids),
  `background` (`claude-haiku-*` ids: titles/summaries), `unknown` (anything
  unrecognized; default `main`, `reject` to 404).
- `providers:` only for endpoints the built-in presets don't cover. Presets
  (openrouter, openai, anthropic, moonshot, fireworks, together, groq,
  deepinfra, deepseek, mistral, xai, cerebras, ollama, azure) imply base URL
  and key env var.
- Known model families get capabilities from the quirk table in
  `src/schema.rs` (e.g. Kimi: `temperature`/`top_p` stripped because the API
  rejects them, reasoning preserved across tool turns, vision enabled).

Secrets never go in the YAML: provider keys come from env vars, any value can
be written as `${VAR}`, and `GATEWAY_BIND` / `GATEWAY_TOKEN` override the
listen address and auth token from the environment.

## Operating the gateway

### Start it

```bash
cargo run --release -- --config ./gateway.yaml
# or a prebuilt binary:
./target/release/gateway --config ./gateway.yaml
```

Verify: `curl http://127.0.0.1:4000/health` → `{"status":"ok",...}`.

### Connect Claude Code

Project-level `.claude/settings.json` (preferred — survives shell changes):

```json
{
  "model": "kimi",
  "env": {
    "CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK": "0",
    "ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL": "http://127.0.0.1:4000/anthropic",
    "ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN": "local-dev-token",
    "CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_GATEWAY_MODEL_DISCOVERY": "1"
  }
}
```

Notes learned the hard way:
- Use `127.0.0.1`, not `localhost` (IPv6 resolution), although the gateway
  now serves both loopbacks.
- A global `~/.claude/settings.json` forcing Bedrock/Vertex overrides
  everything and produces confusing 403s; neutralize it per project as above.
- Set `"model"` explicitly. Without it Claude Code requests its default
  model id (often `claude-opus-*`), which routes to the `subagent` role, not
  `main`.
- Bare model names from `gateway.yaml` are sent verbatim and always work
  (`claude --model <name>`). Discovery additionally lists each named model in
  the /model picker via a `claude-<name>` twin id (Claude Code refuses to
  list non-Claude-looking ids); both ids route identically. Discovery results
  are cached in `~/.claude/cache/gateway-models.json` — delete it if the
  picker shows stale entries.

### Connect Codex

User-level `~/.codex/config.toml` (project-local provider config is ignored
by Codex):

```toml
model = "kimi"
model_provider = "gateway"

[model_providers.gateway]
name = "Gateway"
base_url = "http://127.0.0.1:4000/openai/v1"
env_key = "GATEWAY_TOKEN"
wire_api = "responses"
```

```bash
export GATEWAY_TOKEN="local-dev-token"
codex
```

### Smoke-test without a client

```bash
# Anthropic front door
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:4000/v1/messages \
  -H "content-type: application/json" -H "x-api-key: local-dev-token" \
  -d '{"model":"kimi","max_tokens":64,"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"say ok"}]}'

# Responses front door
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:4000/v1/responses \
  -H "content-type: application/json" -H "authorization: Bearer local-dev-token" \
  -d '{"model":"kimi","input":[{"role":"user","content":"say ok"}]}'
```

A tool-using prompt through the real client is the meaningful acceptance
test: it exercises tool translation and (for Kimi-family models) the
reasoning round-trip that plain text prompts never touch.

## Deployment

### Docker

```bash
docker build -t gateway .
docker run -d -p 4000:4000 \
  -v ./gateway.yaml:/etc/gateway/gateway.yaml:ro \
  -e OPENROUTER_API_KEY \
  -e GATEWAY_TOKEN \
  gateway
```

Or `docker compose up -d`. The image (multi-stage, distroless, ~60 MB) sets
`GATEWAY_BIND=0.0.0.0:4000`; the binary refuses non-localhost binds without
an auth token, so a token must come from the config or `GATEWAY_TOKEN`.

### Cloud checklist

1. Bake or mount `gateway.yaml`; it must contain no secrets.
2. Provide provider keys and `GATEWAY_TOKEN` as platform secrets.
3. Liveness/readiness probe: `GET /health` (no auth required).
4. Replace `local-dev-token` with a strong token; it protects a public
   endpoint that spends your provider credits.
5. Terminate TLS in front (the gateway serves plain HTTP) and point clients
   at `https://host/anthropic` / `https://host/openai/v1`.
6. Streaming: ensure any proxy in front does not buffer SSE responses and
   allows long-lived connections (agent turns can run minutes).
7. One structured JSON log line per request attempt (`request_id`, `client`,
   `model_alias`, `route_id`, `attempt`, `status`, `fallback_used`,
   `duration_ms`, `session_id`) — ship stdout to your log system.
   `log_prompts: true` logs full request bodies; leave it off in production.

## Debugging playbook

- **Client retries / connection refused**: is the gateway up (`/health`)?
  Right loopback? Claude Code hides the real error; run it with
  `--debug-to-stderr` and look for the failing URL.
- **401 from the gateway**: token mismatch — check `Authorization: Bearer` /
  `x-api-key` against `server.token(s)` + `GATEWAY_TOKEN`.
- **404 unknown model**: the requested id isn't a model name and `unknown`
  is `reject`. Gateway logs show every rejection with a reason.
- **Upstream 4xx passed through verbatim**: intentional — clients key their
  retry behavior off original provider errors. Read the logged
  `upstream error` line (body included, truncated).
- **Tool loop breaks after one turn on a reasoning model**: the model's
  reasoning content is probably being dropped; check the quirk table entry
  and the `thinking` capability for the route.
- **Fallback didn't trigger**: it only runs on connection failure or a
  retryable status (408/429/5xx) *before* any output streamed. Mid-stream
  failures surface to the client by design.

## Invariants (do not break)

1. No fallback or retry after user-visible output or after a tool call has
   started streaming. Silent replays corrupt agent tool loops.
2. Upstream error status + body are forwarded byte-for-byte.
3. Anthropic passthrough (Claude Code → Anthropic upstream) stays
   byte-for-byte, headers (`anthropic-*`) included.
4. Reasoning content (`thinking` blocks ⇄ `reasoning_content`/`reasoning`)
   round-trips for preserved-thinking models in multi-turn tool loops.
5. Auth headers are redacted from logs; prompts are not logged by default.
6. Secrets never appear in `gateway.yaml`, images, or git history
   (`.gitignore` covers `.env*`; `.dockerignore` keeps them out of builds).
7. Names in `models:` are the only client-facing identities. Roles stay
   internal (hidden aliases); don't reintroduce synthetic exposed ids.
8. All tests green (`cargo test`) and clippy clean before finishing a change.
