## CODING ENVIRONMENT

- Install astral uv using "curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh" if not already installed and if already installed then update it to the latest version
- Install Python 3.14.0 stable using `uv python install 3.14.0` if not already installed (requires uv >=0.9; see `[tool.uv] required-version` in `pyproject.toml`)
- Always use `uv run` to run files instead of the global `python` command.
- Current uv ruff formatter is set to py314 which has supports multiple exception types without paranthesis (except TypeError, ValueError:)
- Read `.env.example` for environment variables.
- All CI checks must pass; failing checks block merge.
- Add tests for new changes (including edge cases).
- Before pushing, prefer `./scripts/ci.sh` (macOS/Linux) or `.\scripts\ci.ps1` (Windows) to run the local CI sequence; requires `uv` on PATH. The local scripts run Ruff in repair mode (`ruff format`, then `ruff check --fix`) before type checking and tests.
- Use `--only` / `--skip` (PowerShell: `-Only` / `-Skip`) to run a subset when iterating; use `--dry-run` to print commands without running them.
- GitHub CI remains check-only for Ruff (`ruff format --check`, `ruff check`) so branch protection verifies committed code.
- Fall back to individual repair commands when debugging local failures: `uv run ruff format`, `uv run ruff check --fix`, `uv run ty check`, `uv run pytest -v --tb=short`. Use GitHub-style checks only when verifying enforcement locally: `uv run ruff format --check`, `uv run ruff check`.
- Do not add `# type: ignore` or `# ty: ignore`; fix the underlying type issue.
- Do not add `from __future__ import annotations`; Python 3.14 native lazy annotations are the project standard.
- All 5 check IDs are represented in `scripts/ci.sh` / `scripts/ci.ps1` and enforced in `tests.yml` on push/merge (parallel jobs: suppression grep, ruff-format, ruff-check, ty, pytest).
- GitHub CI runs on `push`, `pull_request`, and `merge_group` so required checks validate merge queue candidates before they land.
- Repository protection should use rulesets: a non-bypassable main integrity ruleset requires pull requests, merge queue, required checks, and blocks direct/force pushes to `main`; a separate review ruleset may allow `Alishahryar1`/admins to bypass review only.
- Required status checks: set **required status checks** to **all** of those statuses (e.g. **Ban suppressions and legacy annotations**, **ruff-format**, **ruff-check**, **ty**, **pytest**—use the exact labels GitHub shows, which may be prefixed with **CI /**). Remove **ci** from required checks if it was previously added for the old gate job.

## IDENTITY & CONTEXT

- You are an expert Software Architect and Systems Engineer.
- Goal: Zero-defect, root-cause-oriented engineering for bugs; test-driven engineering for new features. Think carefully; no need to rush.
- Code: Write the simplest code possible. Keep the codebase minimal and modular.

## ARCHITECTURE PRINCIPLES

- **Shared utilities**: Put shared Anthropic protocol logic in neutral `src/my_claude_code/core/anthropic/` modules. Do not have one provider import from another provider's utils.
- **Failure ownership**: Keep canonical failure semantics and redaction SDK-free in `core/`; providers alone classify SDK/HTTP failures and own retries; protocol/API adapters alone choose wire error types and commit-boundary serialization.
- **DRY**: Extract shared base classes to eliminate duplication. Prefer composition over copy-paste.
- **Encapsulation**: Use accessor methods for internal state (e.g. `set_current_task()`), not direct `_attribute` assignment from outside.
- **Provider-specific config**: Keep provider-specific fields (e.g. `nim_settings`) in provider constructors, not in the base `ProviderConfig`.
- **Model-independent reasoning**: Resolve client reasoning intent once at the application boundary; provider adapters translate documented provider capabilities. Never branch on upstream model names or versions to choose reasoning behavior.
- **Dead code**: Remove unused code, legacy systems, and hardcoded values. Use settings/config instead of literals (e.g. `settings.provider_type` not `"nvidia_nim"`).
- **Performance**: Use list accumulation for strings (not `+=` in loops), cache env vars at init, prefer iterative over recursive when stack depth matters.
- **Platform-agnostic naming**: Use generic names (e.g. `PLATFORM_EDIT`) not platform-specific ones (e.g. `TELEGRAM_EDIT`) in shared code.
- **No type ignores**: Do not add `# type: ignore` or `# ty: ignore`. Fix the underlying type issue.
- **Python 3.14 annotations**: Do not use `from __future__ import annotations`; rely on native lazy annotations and fix circular import boundaries instead of hiding them with annotation stringization.
- **Imports**: Prefer top-level imports. Avoid `TYPE_CHECKING` and local imports for first-party or required dependencies; if a top-level import creates a cycle, move shared types/protocols to a neutral owner.
- **Complete migrations**: When moving modules, update imports to the new owner and remove old compatibility shims in the same change unless preserving a published interface is explicitly required.
- **Maximum Test Coverage**: There should be maximum test coverage for everything, preferably live smoke test coverage to catch bugs early
- **Tests never touch the real machine.** `tests/support/hermetic.py` gives every test its own `HOME`/`APPDATA` under `tmp_path`, replaces `winreg` with an in-memory fake, and refuses any write inside the real `~/.fcc`/`~/.mcc`/`~/.claude`/`%APPDATA%`/Start Menu/`~/.config`, any browser or coding-agent launch, and any bind of the default server port. Redirecting *one* path and hoping is how a green run deleted the developer's Windows autostart registration and rewrote their harness catalogues: the guard now fails such a test instead. Read `tests/README.md` before opting out with `touches_registry`, `spawns_process` or `binds_reserved_port`.
- **Admin UI changes ship with jsdom coverage, and jsdom is not enough.** `tests/api/admin_jsdom_harness.mjs` renders the real `index.html` and evals the real `admin.js`, so it proves behaviour: what a gesture does to a hidden input, what a panel says, which key went out on the wire. It cannot prove *layout* -- jsdom has no CSS box model -- so a change that adds elements to a rendered row must also be opened in a browser. It must also not use `PointerEvent` or `DataTransfer`, which jsdom does not implement; synthesize pointer drags as `new window.MouseEvent("pointerdown"/"pointerover"/"pointerup")`, which is why the product's drags are built on pointer events rather than HTML5 drag-and-drop.
- **Adding a child to a rendered row means checking its grid.** `.route-node` and `.route-rail .model-chain-row` declare explicit `grid-template-columns`; an extra child silently wraps onto a second line and every test still passes. If a child can be `hidden`, wrap it with a sibling in a cell -- a `display: none` grid item vacates its column and shifts every control after it.

## COGNITIVE WORKFLOW

1. **ANALYZE**: Read relevant files. Do not guess.
2. **PLAN**: Map out the logic. Identify root cause or required changes. Order changes by dependency.
3. **EXECUTE**: Fix the cause, not the symptom. Execute incrementally with clear commits.
4. **VERIFY**: Run `./scripts/ci.sh` or `.\scripts\ci.ps1`, plus relevant smoke tests when needed. Confirm the fix via logs or output.
5. **SPECIFICITY**: Do exactly as much as asked; nothing more, nothing less.
6. **PROPAGATION**: Changes impact multiple files; propagate updates correctly.
7. **VERSION**: If the commit touches production files on `main`, bump semver in the same commit (see [Versioning](#versioning-main)).

## VERSIONING (MAIN)

Every commit on `main` that changes a **production file** must include a semver bump in **`pyproject.toml`** in the **same commit**. Do not merge or push prod changes without updating the version.

### Production files

These paths count as production (runtime, packaging, or install surface):

- `src/my_claude_code/api/`, `src/my_claude_code/cli/`, `src/my_claude_code/config/`, `src/my_claude_code/core/`, `src/my_claude_code/messaging/`, `src/my_claude_code/providers/`
- `src/my_claude_code/application/`
- `.env.example`
- `pyproject.toml` (dependencies, scripts, packaging)
- `scripts/install.sh`, `scripts/install.ps1`, `scripts/uninstall.sh`, `scripts/uninstall.ps1`, `scripts/ci.sh`, `scripts/ci.ps1`

These do **not** require a version bump on their own:

- `tests/`, `smoke/`
- Docs and assets: `README.md`, `assets/`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`
- CI and repo config: `.github/`, `.gitignore`

If a single commit mixes production and non-production edits, still bump the version.

### Semver rules

Use `[project].version` as `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`:

- **PATCH** (`x.y.Z+1`): bug fixes, refactors with no user-visible behavior change, dependency updates, packaging/install fixes.
- **MINOR** (`x.Y+1.0`): backward-compatible features—new providers, admin fields, CLI commands, config options, or behavior additions.
- **MAJOR** (`X+1.0.0`): breaking changes—removed or renamed env vars, incompatible API/CLI/default changes, or migrations users must act on.

When unsure between PATCH and MINOR, prefer PATCH for fixes and MINOR for new capability.

### Required steps

1. Classify the change and choose the bump level.
2. Update `version` in `pyproject.toml`.
3. Run `uv lock` so `uv.lock` reflects the new package version.
4. Include the version and lockfile updates in the same commit as the production change.

Example commit on `main` after a packaging fix: bump `1.2.38` → `1.2.39`, run `uv lock`, commit together with the fix.

## WORKING NOTES (READ FIRST, THEN MAINTAIN)

`WORKING-NOTES.md` in the repo root is the operating manual for this project:
the user's standing preferences, the release process, CI quirks that waste
hours, domain gotchas, product principles, and known gaps. It is **git-ignored
and local** — it exists so hard-won context survives between sessions.

### Read it first

Read `WORKING-NOTES.md` before starting anything non-trivial. It will save you
from re-learning things the expensive way. If it is missing, say so and offer
to start one; do not silently proceed without it.

It records, among other things:

- Which remote to push to, and which one never to touch.
- The release sequence, and why an earlier ordering was wrong.
- Which tests silently **skip** on one platform and therefore prove nothing.
- Which local test failures are pre-existing and not caused by your change.
- Product principles that were stated firmly (for example: never introduce
  hardcoded ceilings or budgets for a provider's capacity).

### Maintain it

Treat it as part of the deliverable, not an afterthought. Update it in the same
session you learn something, while the detail is still exact.

Add an entry when you:

- **Lose time to something non-obvious** — a platform difference, a silent
  skip, a scoping rule, a tool that lies about a failure.
- **Get corrected by the user**, especially on product direction. Record the
  principle and the reasoning, not just the instruction.
- **Ship a release** — append it to the version table with one line on what it
  contained.
- **Discover a gap you are deliberately not fixing** — put it under open items
  with enough detail to act on later.
- **Find that the notes are now wrong.** Stale guidance is worse than none:
  correct the section rather than appending a contradiction. (The release
  process was rewritten once when version pinning was removed.)

Write findings so they are useful cold: state the symptom, the cause, and the
rule to follow next time. Prefer "PowerShell installer tests never run on Linux
CI, so a PS-only regression ships green" over "be careful with CI".

Keep it local. It is in `.gitignore` on purpose — it is a working artifact, not
user documentation, and it may reference machine-specific paths and running
processes.

## SUMMARY STANDARDS

- Summaries must be technical and granular.
- Include: [Files Changed], [Logic Altered], [Verification Method], [Residual Risks] (if no residual risks then say none).

## TOOLS

- Prefer built-in tools (grep, read_file, etc.) over manual workflows. Check tool availability before use.
