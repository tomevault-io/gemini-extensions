## Model Swap Workshop

Frontier labs are releasing new models constantly, and it is hard to know when "better" is better enough to justify touching a working system. On top of that, "just swap the model" often turns into real work because providers expose different APIs and different expectations around tools and structured outputs.

The model swap workshop is a hands-on bake-off across frontier LLMs. We run the same scenarios using multiple models (OpenAI, Anthropic, Kimi, and more) and compare results side by side for agentic tool use, structured outputs, and multimodal tasks.

Swapping models is not just changing a model name. In this workshop, you actually do the swaps, including moving between OpenAI-style Responses APIs and Anthropic-style Messages APIs, then see what breaks and what needs to change in prompts, tool definitions, and JSON strategies.

The workshop finishes by running a small eval suite so you can quantify tradeoffs instead of relying on vibes. We provide the Microsoft Foundry environment for access to models, no account needed.

## Samples in this repo

All examples authenticate to Foundry using an API key and reference environment variables from a `.env` file.

**Note:** `structured_outputs.py` is kept for reference but removed from the workshop flow. Rationale:
1. Structured outputs require 3 different approaches across models (responses.parse for GPT, tool-calling fallback for others, Messages API for Anthropic), making it awkward to present as a single example.
2. Tool calling already demonstrates structured output extraction — models must produce valid JSON matching a schema.
3. Removing it gives a better flow from tool calling straight into agentic patterns.

Key SDKs/frameworks used:
- **OpenAI Python SDK** (`openai`): For calling Foundry-hosted OpenAI models via the Responses API.
- **Anthropic Python SDK** (`anthropic`): For calling Foundry-hosted Claude models via the Messages API.
- **PydanticAI** (`pydantic-ai`): Agent framework with typed tool support, works with OpenAI or Anthropic providers.
- **LangChain** (`langchain`, `langchain-azure-ai`): Agent framework using `AzureAIOpenAIApiChatModel` for OpenAI via Responses API.
- **Microsoft Agent Framework** (`agent-framework-*`): Microsoft's agent framework, supporting OpenAI and Anthropic clients.
- **DSPy** (`dspy`): Automated prompt optimization framework.

Some files not in the main workshop flow use additional packages via PEP 723 inline script metadata:
- `azure-ai-evaluation` (in `evals_foundry_judge.py`, `evals_agent.py`)
- `azure-ai-projects`, `azure-identity` (in `evals_foundry_project.py`)
- `pydantic-monty` (in `tool_loop_code.py`)

## Open issues affecting these samples

- Anthropic SDK bearer-token callable support: https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-python/issues/1496#issuecomment-4685322526
    This affects Foundry auth ergonomics for Anthropic-based samples because the SDK currently expects a sync `AccessTokenProvider` instead of a simpler bearer-token callback shape.
- LangChain Azure Anthropic Messages API support: https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain-azure/issues/673
    This affects whether Claude via Foundry can be handled through `langchain-azure-ai` instead of mixing `langchain-anthropic` with Foundry-specific configuration.
- MAF Anthropic workflow assistant-message compatibility fix: https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework/pull/6207
    This affects multi-agent workflow chaining with Anthropic, where assistant-role messages may need re-roling to user until the upstream fix is available in a released version.
- OpenAI SDK `DEFER_PYDANTIC_BUILD` / `MockValSer` crash: https://github.com/openai/openai-python/issues/1306
    The SDK defers pydantic model builds by default to speed up imports. When it then uses `model_construct()` to build response objects (bypassing validation), calling `model_dump()` on those objects crashes with `TypeError: 'MockValSer' object is not an instance of 'SchemaSerializer'`. Workaround: set `DEFER_PYDANTIC_BUILD=0` before importing openai. Examples that use `responses.parse()` do this via `os.environ.setdefault("DEFER_PYDANTIC_BUILD", "0")` at the top of the file.
- OpenAI SDK `responses.parse()` `PydanticSerializationUnexpectedValue` warnings: https://github.com/openai/openai-python/issues/2872
    When calling `responses.parse()`, pydantic emits a flood of `PydanticSerializationUnexpectedValue` warnings because the SDK's `output` field is a large union and pydantic tries every variant when serializing. The warnings are non-fatal and the parsed result is correct. A fix PR (#2885) using `SerializeAsAny` has been open since February but not yet merged. Workaround: suppress with `warnings.filterwarnings("ignore", message="Pydantic serializer warnings", category=UserWarning)`.

## Interesting model differences

- **Kimi**: Always starts response content with a reasoning item (e.g. `{'type': 'reasoning', ...}`) before the text item. Code that assumes `content[0]` is the text block will break.
- **gpt-5.5**: Does not support `temperature` parameter (returns 400 error). Use `reasoning.effort` instead.
- **DeepSeek-V4-Flash / DeepSeek-V4-Pro**: Do not enforce strict structured outputs. When using `responses.parse()` with `text_format`, the model may return prose instead of JSON, or return JSON with invented field names that don't match the schema (e.g. `issue_type` instead of `type`). Simple schemas (like `CalendarEvent`) may work by luck, but complex schemas with enums or non-obvious field names fail. These models also do not support image/vision inputs (returns 400 error via Responses API). Via Chat Completions API, they silently accept image payloads but do not actually process the image pixels — DeepSeek-V4-Flash admits it cannot see images, while DeepSeek-V4-Pro confidently hallucinate descriptions based on the text prompt alone.
- **Kimi-K2.6**: Supports image/vision inputs via Chat Completions API, but only with inline base64-encoded data URIs. Remote image URLs return a 400 error. Via Responses API, all image inputs are rejected.
- **Anthropic on Foundry**: URL-based image sources (`"type": "url"`) in the Messages API return "Unable to download the file" error. Use base64-encoded images instead. This appears to be a Foundry-specific limitation — the same URL sources work against the Anthropic API directly.

## TODOs

- [x] Check for temperature support across the models
- [x] Try chat completions with image input for other models 
- [x] Try multilingual scenarios since models differ in their language support
    Tested translation, cross-lingual instruction following (Chinese→Spanish), and idiomatic translation.
    All four models handle multilingual well — no meaningful correctness variance found.
- [x] Try code execution (with monty, maybe with tool calling)
- [x] Add evals
- [ ] Add ASSERT- https://github.com/responsibleai/ASSERT - on an agent

## Package management

This project uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for dependency management. Use `uv` commands instead of `pip`:

```bash
uv add <package>
uv sync
```

## Manual test plan

Run the repo-root test script:

```bash
./manual_test.sh
```

Keep `manual_test.sh` up to date whenever you add a new sample or add support for another model path in an existing sample.

## Debugging Azure Python SDK HTTP requests

When debugging HTTP interactions between Azure Python SDKs (like `azure-ai-evaluation`) and Azure services, there are three levels of logging you can enable:

### 1. Azure SDK logger (request headers and URLs)

Set the Azure SDK loggers to DEBUG level to see request URLs, headers, and status codes:

```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.WARNING)
logging.getLogger("azure").setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
logging.getLogger("azure.core.pipeline.policies.http_logging_policy").setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
```

### 2. Raw HTTP wire data (request/response headers)

Enable `http.client` debug logging to see the raw HTTP wire protocol, including request and response headers:

```python
import http.client
http.client.HTTPConnection.debuglevel = 1
```

Note: Response bodies will typically not be visible at this level because Azure SDKs use gzip compression, and `http.client` logs the raw compressed bytes.

### 3. Decompressed response bodies

To see actual response bodies, monkey-patch the Azure SDK's `HttpLoggingPolicy.on_response` method. This works because `response.http_response.body()` returns the decompressed content:

```python
from azure.core.pipeline.policies import HttpLoggingPolicy

_original_on_response = HttpLoggingPolicy.on_response

def _on_response_with_body(self, request, response):
    _original_on_response(self, request, response)
    try:
        body = response.http_response.body()
        if body:
            _logger = logging.getLogger("azure.core.pipeline.policies.http_logging_policy")
            _logger.debug("Response body: %s", body[:4096].decode("utf-8", errors="replace"))
    except Exception:
        pass

HttpLoggingPolicy.on_response = _on_response_with_body
```
