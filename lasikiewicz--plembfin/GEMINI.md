> read-only monitor for the Plembfin feature requests on Plex, Emby, and Jellyfin;
> it reports status, votes, comments, and any reply that needs a draft.

## Local testing context

When local-server or connected-browser testing is explicitly requested, check whether
`.claude/local-environment.md` exists and read it before testing. It contains
machine-specific local URLs and signed-in browser-session context, and is intentionally
gitignored. Treat it as optional because it is absent from fresh clones and other
machines.

## Agent Guidelines

- **No Git Pushes** - Never execute `git push` or push commits to any remote repository unless the user explicitly instructs you to push in their request.
- **No Deployments** - Never deploy the application or run deployment commands unless explicitly instructed by the user.
- **No Unsolicited Actions** - Do only exactly what the user asks. Do not perform unsolicited refactorings, add extra features, or modify files outside the direct scope of the request.
- **No Browser Actions Unless Asked** - Never open web browsers/browser tools unless the user has explicitly requested it. Test commands are part of the normal project checks: run `npm test` or `npm run build` when a change touches code covered by those checks or when the user asks for verification.
- **Website-only safety** - Website/Traks work must use the local `website/` checks/build and direct deployment to `plembfin-website`; it must never modify GitHub `main`, trigger application CI, run the root build, or touch the `plembfin` application project. The only exception is the explicit release workflow **"Force to main"**.
- **Act immediately on simple requests** - If the user describes a clear, specific change, make it directly without preamble, planning steps, or explanation. Save analysis for genuinely complex or ambiguous tasks.

## Branching model: `develop` → `alpha` → `main`

Day-to-day work lands on the `develop` branch, never directly on `alpha` or `main`.
`alpha` only moves when the separate "Force to alpha" command explicitly promotes
`develop` onto it; `main` only moves when "Force to main" explicitly promotes `alpha`
onto it, and each promotion to `main` becomes exactly one release (one changelog entry,
one version bump, one `:latest` + versioned Docker image publish).
After a main promotion nothing is pushed back: the release is not merged into `develop`
and `origin/develop` is not touched. Each promotion writes the new version numbers into the
local manifests and the next ordinary "Push to git" publishes them. This is what keeps a
promotion to one channel from also publishing a second, meaningless develop image. See
`docs/decisions.md` entry 18, which supersedes entries 7, 9, and 16.

### Changelog content is computed locally, before every push - never by CI

All three of `changelog.develop.json`, `changelog.alpha.json`, and `changelog.json` are
written locally, by the push command that produces them, from real local git history.
No CI job ever writes changelog content or a version back to a branch; the publish
workflows only build, verify, and publish using values already committed.

The reason: `alpha` and `main` are always reached by force-push, and a force-push's
GitHub push event carries an empty or incomplete commit list, so anything computed from
it comes out truncated. Local git history is always complete. See `docs/decisions.md`
entry 6 for what was rejected and why.

Build versions are five numeric segments, `major.minor.patch.alpha.dev`: the released
semver, then alpha builds since that release, then develop builds since the last alpha
build. Trailing zeros are trimmed for display, so a release still reads `v1.1.0` and an
alpha build `v1.1.0.1`. `package.json` keeps the three-segment semver only. See
`scripts/version.js`.

- **`develop`**: `scripts/rebuild-develop-changelog.js` recomputes the single entry from
  every real commit between `resetCommit` and `HEAD`, and restamps `public/` assets with
  this build's version. Shows as the five-segment version itself, trailing zeros trimmed
  (`1.1.0.1.3`).
- **`alpha`**: `scripts/promote-develop-to-alpha.js` prepends develop's entry as its own
  standalone build entry, so a tester sees each build separately, and requires the user to
  approve that entry before anything is committed. Shows as `v<version> alpha`.
- **`main`**: `scripts/promote-alpha-to-main.js` consolidates the cycle's alpha entries
  into one release, headlined by the `releaseMessage` the operator writes and the user
  approves, then bumps the real semver.

Both promotion scripts run `changelogEntryProcessViolations` (`scripts/changelog-message.js`)
and refuse to write an entry containing recognized release-process text.

Full detail, including the per-branch file formats, image tags, and the publish
workflows, is in [`docs/development.md`](docs/development.md). The step-by-step
procedures live in the `push-to-git`, `force-to-alpha`, and `force-to-main` skills.

## Release commands: use the matching skill

Six phrases trigger a named release, publishing, local-development, or request-monitoring procedure. Each one lives in its own skill or local workflow so the
whole procedure arrives fresh at invocation instead of competing for attention here.
**Invoke the skill and follow it exactly. Never improvise or reconstruct these
procedures from memory.**

| The user says | Invoke |
| --- | --- |
| "Push to git", "Push all to git", "push all the git" (any case) | `push-to-git` |
| "Force to alpha" (exactly) | `force-to-alpha` |
| "Force to main" (exactly) | `force-to-main` |
| "Push website live" (case-insensitive) | `push-website-live` |
| "Start the website" (case-insensitive) | `start-website` |
| "Start the server" (case-insensitive) | Start or reuse the Plembfin application server using the network-enabled launch path |
| "Check requests" (case-insensitive) | `.claude/check-requests.md` |

These hold regardless of which skill is running, so they are repeated here:

- Never run `git push` because one of these phrases appeared. The phrase means run the
  workflow; the push is one late step inside it, after every gate has passed.
- Never deploy, and never push to any remote, unless the user explicitly asked in that
  request.
- "Push website live" is the website-only publish workflow: use the current local
  `website/` tree and deploy directly to `plembfin-website` with Wrangler. Do not run
  the root Plembfin build, push GitHub, or trigger the application CI workflows.
- "Start the website" is local-only: start or reuse the Astro dev server on
  `http://localhost:4321/` and open that URL for editing/testing. Do not deploy it or
  run the root Plembfin build.
- "Start the server" is the Plembfin application-server workflow: start or reuse
  `npm start` (or `npm run dev` when auto-reload is requested) on `http://localhost:5055`.
  On Windows, the agent must launch it with `exec_command` using
  `sandbox_permissions: "require_escalated"` and a user-facing justification that
  network access is required for Plex, Emby, Jellyfin, Trakt, TMDB, or TVDB. Never
  launch this server from the restricted sandbox; it can bind localhost while blocking
  the outbound connections the application needs.
- "Check requests" is local-only and read-only: inspect the registered Plex, Emby, and
  Jellyfin request pages in connected Chrome, compare public status/vote/comment data
  with the ignored local snapshot, and draft (but do not post) replies when a maintainer
  needs an answer. If a provider asks for login, stop at that provider and tell the user
  which session needs attention.
- Never bypass a hook with `--no-verify`, and never bypass the changelog rebuild.
- After every completed local commit, merge, amend, or rebase, the `.githooks/post-commit`,
  `post-merge`, and `post-rewrite` hooks regenerate the ignored `plan/updates.md` ledger
  from committed history since `origin/main`. Refresh it with `npm run updates:refresh`
  before Push to git or Force to main; use its unique changelog bullets and grouped website
  targets as the review inventory. It is not a replacement for the committed changelog
  manifests or the human website gate.
- Before any of the three, check that GHCR Cleanup is not mid-run
  (`gh run list --workflow ghcr-cleanup.yml --limit 1`); each skill repeats this as its
  first step.
- "Force to alpha" and "Force to main" are force-pushes to shared branches. Show the user
  what is about to land first. Both require explicit user approval of the previewed
  changelog in chat before anything is staged, and both then stop every local server and
  start the build being published so the user can check it before the push. "Force to main" also runs the mandatory
  website update gate, and stops if that gate produces a website change, because the
  release is built from alpha's tip and the change must travel through "Force to alpha"
  first.
- Neither force command pushes `develop`. If a procedure tells you to, it is out of date.
- Day-to-day work lands on `develop`, never directly on `alpha` or `main`.

## Documentation and backlog sync

[`plan/todo.md`](plan/todo.md) is the single backlog: it indexes every plan in `plan/`,
records each one's status, and carries the unscheduled items below that index. There is no
root `TODO.md`; it was retired on 15 September 2026 and its items were folded into plans.

When implementing or finishing work described there, update the entry in the same change -
remove it when it is genuinely finished, or move it to a truthful status when it is not. If
the completed work changes user-visible behavior, also update the relevant `docs/` page and
README section. Before removing an item, verify that the code and documentation both
describe the current behavior.

### MANDATORY: keep the TODO current, and never overstate status

**Before ending any turn that changed code, and before starting a new phase of work,
update [`plan/todo.md`](plan/todo.md) with the real status**, together with the status line
in the plan the work belongs to. This is not optional and does not wait to be asked. Work
with no plan of its own goes under that file's "Unscheduled backlog" heading; if it is
substantial enough to need one, write the plan.

The status must be accurate rather than flattering. Specifically:

- **Distinguish "implemented", "unit-tested", and "verified".** Code that compiles is not
  tested. Code covered by tests that stub the network is not verified against the real
  service. Each is a separate claim; only make the ones that are true.
- **A plan is only `Completed` once its own verification section has actually been run.**
  Until then it is `Implemented and unit-tested; not yet Completed`, with the outstanding
  checks listed individually as unticked boxes, not summarized.
- **List what is NOT verified explicitly**, including the failure mode. "Emby `DatePlayed`
  unconfirmed - a wrong format degrades silently to watched-dated-today while still
  reporting success" is useful; "some testing remains" is not.
- **Record scoping calls made during implementation** that the user has not reviewed, so a
  decision taken for expediency cannot quietly become settled behaviour.
- **Never mark a downstream plan unblocked** because an upstream plan was implemented. It
  unblocks when the upstream plan reaches `Completed`.

A task is finished when it is verified, not when it is written.

### Decision records

[`docs/decisions.md`](docs/decisions.md) holds the reasoning behind deliberate calls, so
it survives a squashed history and a later reader does not undo an incident-driven
safeguard without seeing the incident. Add a numbered entry only when all three are true:
a plausible alternative existed and was rejected, the reason is not visible from reading
the code, and undoing it later would cost real time, data, or user trust. Ordinary
implementation choices, anything already stated in a feature doc, and release bookkeeping
do not get entries. Append in date order, never renumber, and mark a reversed decision as
superseded with a pointer to the entry that replaced it rather than deleting it.

Before changing behavior that looks unnecessarily cautious - a dropped sync signal, an
extra confirmation step, a guard that seems redundant - check `docs/decisions.md` first.


## Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies (native modules better-sqlite3 + sharp install via prebuilt binaries)
npm install

# Run the app locally (serves UI + API + scheduler on http://localhost:5055).
# On Windows, use the approved elevated network-enabled execution path.
npm start

# Run with auto-reload during development (also use the elevated path on Windows)
npm run dev

# Build & run as a container
docker compose up --build
```

### Local-server launch standard

On Windows, every local server opened for browser, provider-backed, or connected-service
testing must be started through the approved elevated network-enabled execution path by
default. Do not start `npm start` or `npm run dev` inside the restricted sandbox: outbound
provider requests can fail with `EACCES` even when the application and provider are healthy.
Offline unit tests and static checks may still run in the restricted sandbox.

This is a launch-environment rule, not a replacement npm command: `npm start` remains the
canonical server command. A normal host PowerShell terminal is already network-enabled;
agent-launched starts must explicitly request the elevated network-enabled execution path.

### Network-backed local testing

Provider-backed flows (TMDB, TVDB, Plex, Emby, Jellyfin, or Trakt) must be tested
with the local server started using the approved network-enabled execution path on
Windows. A server started inside the restricted sandbox can report `EACCES` while
opening an outbound provider connection even though the application and provider
are healthy. Stop that process, start the same command with approved elevated
network access, confirm `http://localhost:5055` responds, and only then diagnose
provider or application behavior. Treat an outbound-fetch `EACCES` from the
restricted process as an execution-environment failure, not an application result.

### Restricted Windows Git checks

The managed workspace may deny Git access to the user-level excludes file at
`C:\Users\<user>\.config\git\ignore`. For read-only status checks in that
environment, use a per-command repository-local excludes file instead of changing
global Git configuration:

```powershell
git -c core.excludesFile=C:\path\to\plembfin\.git\info\exclude status --short --branch
```

Do not modify global Git configuration or the repository config to work around that
host permission boundary.

`npm test` runs the focused `node:test` suite under `test/`. `npm run build` runs the
syntax check, the same `node:test` suite, JSON validation, the server-side outbound-fetch guard, and a
one-shot server boot against a temp `DATA_DIR`. There is no separate linter configured.

The app listens on `PORT` (default `5055`). On a fresh install the admin username defaults
to `admin`; if `ADMIN_PASSWORD` isn't set, a random password is generated and printed once
to the server console/logs. Override with the `ADMIN_USERNAME` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD` environment
variables. On first boot the server writes `data/config.json` with the admin credentials,
a generated API key, and a session secret.

## Frontend Module Discipline

> These rules prevent `app.js` from growing back into a monolith.

### File size limits
- **`public/app.js`** - orchestrator only. Must stay under **3,000 lines**. If it approaches this limit, extract the next logical group into a module.
- **`public/modules/*.js`** - individual modules. Soft limit **1,200 lines**; hard limit **1,500 lines**. If a module exceeds 1,200 lines, split it before adding more to it.

#### Grandfathered files (already over, measured 2026-09-08)

These are already past the limits above. The limits still apply in full to every file
not on this list.

| File | Lines | Limit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `public/app.js` | 3428 | 3000 |
| `public/modules/media-detail-show.js` | 2541 | 1500 |
| `public/modules/app-events.js` | 2225 | 1500 |
| `public/modules/sync-activity.js` | 2199 | 1500 |
| `public/modules/explorer.js` | 2098 | 1500 |
| `public/modules/edit-dialogs.js` | 1932 | 1500 |
| `public/modules/media-detail-events.js` | 1774 | 1500 |
| `public/modules/watch-action.js` | 1680 | 1500 |
| `public/modules/tools-maintenance.js` | 1541 | 1500 |
| `public/modules/onboarding.js` | 1442 | 1200 soft |
| `public/modules/sync.js` | 1355 | 1200 soft |
| `public/modules/tools-backups.js` | 1307 | 1200 soft |

**Do not grow them.** New code for these feature areas goes into a new or existing
sibling module, not onto the end of one of these.

**Do not split one on your own initiative.** Being over the limit is not a task. Split
only when the work you were already asked to do is touching that file anyway, and even
then say what you propose to extract and get the user's explicit go-ahead first. An
unrequested refactor is a violation of the Agent Guidelines above, and these files are
large precisely because they own a lot of behavior, so a careless split breaks more than
it tidies.

**When a split is approved, do it properly:** move whole feature units rather than
arbitrary line ranges, keep the existing named exports working or update every importer,
add the `modulepreload` link in `index.html`, update the module table below, and check
that nothing else imported what you moved.

### Where new code goes

| Route-module registry: on-demand `import()` loaders, dependency order, `lazyExport`/`ifLoaded`, shell-module readiness and early click/submit hold-and-replay | `modules/route-modules.js` |
| App startup, routing, `bindElements` | `app.js` |

### Creating a new module
If a new feature area doesn't fit any existing module and would exceed 150 lines:
1. Create `public/modules/<feature>.js` using named ES module exports
2. Add `<link rel="modulepreload" href="/modules/<feature>.js" />` to `index.html`
3. Import it in `app.js` (or the owning module)
4. Update this table above

### Dependency rules
- Modules may import from `state.js`, `utils.js`, `images.js`, `auth.js`, `logs.js`, `settings.js`, `settings-ui.js`
- `sync.js` may be imported by `dashboard.js` and `media-detail.js` - not the reverse
- No module may import from `app.js`
- Avoid circular dependencies - if you need A→B and B→A, the shared logic belongs in a third module

## Backend Module Discipline

> These rules prevent `server/src/index.js` from growing back into a monolith.

### File size limits
- **`server/src/index.js`** - route table only. Keep it under **500 lines**.
- **`server/src/routes/*.js`** - owning route modules. Soft limit **1,200 lines**; hard limit **1,500 lines**. Split by feature area before crossing the hard limit.

#### Grandfathered files (already over, measured 2026-09-08)

These are already past the limits above. The limits still apply in full to every file
not on this list. `server/src/index.js` is well inside its own limit at 190 lines.

| File | Lines | Limit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `server/src/routes/sync.js` | 3389 | 1500 |
| `server/src/routes/metadata.js` | 1505 | 1500 |
| `server/src/routes/maintenance.js` | 1399 | 1200 soft |
| `server/src/routes/media.js` | 1311 | 1200 soft |

The same three rules apply as for the frontend list: **do not grow them**, **do not
split one on your own initiative** (only when the work at hand is already touching the
file, and only after proposing the extraction and getting the user's explicit
go-ahead), and **when a split is approved, do it properly** - move whole handler groups,
update the `dispatch()` entries in `server/src/index.js`, keep shared helpers in
`server/src/utils/` only when more than one module needs them, and update the API area
table below.

`sync.js` deserves particular care: it owns webhook ingestion, manual watch and unwatch,
playback progress, the sync job and history APIs, cron and force sync, preview plans, and
now playing. Several of the incident-driven rules in [`docs/decisions.md`](docs/decisions.md)
constrain code in this file.

### Where new route code goes
- Add the route entry in `dispatch()` inside `server/src/index.js`.
- Put the handler in the owning `server/src/routes/*.js` module.
- Keep shared helpers in `server/src/utils/` only when more than one route module needs them.
- Avoid circular imports back into `server/src/index.js`; route modules may import utilities and data-layer modules directly.

| API area | Module |
| --- | --- |
| Config, appearance, Seerr/app links, connection tests | `server/src/routes/admin.js` |
| Personal Rating Sync status, snapshot, explicit push, and retry | `server/src/routes/ratingSync.js` |
| Plex, Emby, and Jellyfin account connection flows | `server/src/routes/mediaAuth.js` |
| Trakt device authorization and connection management | `server/src/routes/trackerAuth.js` |
| Guided first-run setup status/step/import/complete/restart/checklist API | `server/src/routes/onboarding.js` |
| Authenticated browser watch-state update stream | `server/src/routes/liveUpdates.js` |
| Portable, watch-history, and encrypted backup APIs | `server/src/routes/backups.js` |
| History, library, and watch-record edits | `server/src/routes/media.js` |
| TMDB/TVDB/Fanart/OMDb/YouTube metadata and image APIs | `server/src/routes/metadata.js` |
| Webhooks, manual watch/unwatch, playback progress, sync job/history listing, cron/force sync, preview plans, now playing, Up Next push/dismiss/restore | `server/src/routes/sync.js` |
| Backfill, repair, dedup, rematch, cache, logs, changelog, ping | `server/src/routes/maintenance.js` |
| Wipe data: watch history, sync history/logs, and full factory reset (also resets `data/config.json` via `appConfig.js`'s `resetAdminAccount()`) | `server/src/routes/wipeData.js` |
| Scheduler tick and Plex notification listener lifecycle | `server/src/scheduler.js` |

## Architecture: read the docs, do not rely on this file

[`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) is the master guide: the big picture, the
complete file map, request flow, data layer, auth, and environment variables. Read it
before changing anything. This table routes you to the doc that owns the area you are
touching.

| Touching | Read |
| --- | --- |

Three things are worth knowing before you open any of them:

- **One process, one SQLite file.** The default `ROLE=all` process serves the UI, the
  `/api/*` surface, and the per-minute scheduler against `data/plembfin.db`. There is no
  cloud function, no external database, and no separate production environment.
- **`dispatch()` in `server/src/index.js` is the whole route table.** Handlers live in
  the owning `server/src/routes/*.js` module, never in `index.js`.
- **Derived caches are memoized against a shared data version.** `bumpDataVersion()` in
  `server/src/db.js` is what makes every process reload; forgetting it is why a change
  can look like it did not take effect.
