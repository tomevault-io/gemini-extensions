# pencil-dev-skill: Project Context

This is the canonical project-context file. All AI coding tools (Claude Code, OpenAI Codex,
Cursor, etc.) should read this file for project context. Platform-specific files (`CLAUDE.md`)
are thin pointers to this file.

---

## Project Purpose

> **Unofficial community plugin.** This project is not affiliated with or endorsed by the Pencil.dev team. For the Pencil editor, MCP server, and official documentation, visit [pencil.dev](https://pencil.dev).

This repository is a standalone, **platform-agnostic** AI coding skill plugin that teaches
AI coding tools how to work with [pencil.dev](https://pencil.dev) design files (`.pen` format)
via the Pencil MCP server.

**Core artifact:** `skills/pencil-design/SKILL.md`, the platform-agnostic skill content.
**Platform adapters:** `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json`,
`.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, and `gemini-extension.json` are the minimum files required
by each platform's installer; they exist only so users on those platforms can run a
one-line install command. They are not the substance of the project.

---

## Naming Conventions

Three names appear in this project, each scoped to a different layer:

| Name | Scope | Where it appears |
|------|-------|-----------------|
| `pencil-skill` | GitHub repo name | Repo URL, clone URL |
| `pencil-dev-skill` | Plugin package name | `plugin.json`, marketplace listings |
| `pencil-design` | Skill name | `SKILL.md` frontmatter, skill activation triggers |

This is intentional: the repo is the deliverable, the plugin is the package, and the
skill is the capability the AI invokes.

## Platform Support

| Platform | Plugin install | Folder-copy target |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| Claude Code | `/plugin install github:Nisus74/pencil-skill` (manifest at `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`) | `~/.claude/skills/` or `.claude/skills/` |
| Google Gemini CLI | `gemini-extension.json` at repo root | `~/.gemini/skills/` or `.gemini/skills/` (alias `.agents/skills/`) |
| Cursor (2.5+) | `/add-plugin` pointing at `github.com/Nisus74/pencil-skill` (manifest at `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json`) | `.cursor/skills/` (Cursor also reads `AGENTS.md` from project root) |
| OpenAI Codex | `codex plugin install github:Nisus74/pencil-skill` (manifest at `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`) | `~/.codex/skills/` |
| Copilot CLI | (no plugin manifest) | `~/.copilot/skills/` (alias `~/.agents/skills/`) or project `.github/skills/` |

All platforms also accept a `SKILL.md` in their respective skills directory; folder copy works universally.

---

## Deployment and customisation

The full per-platform install instructions live in [README.md](./README.md#install). At a glance:

- **Plugin install** is the right default. Users editing only the design-system scaffolds are unaffected by `/plugin update`, because the skill copies those scaffolds out into the user's project (e.g. `docs/design/`).
- **Folder copy** suits users who want to own the skill files from day one. They edit anything, fetch updates by re-downloading and merging by hand.
- **Fork + install** suits users who want both: full edit access and an automatic update path. Install your fork as a plugin; rebase against upstream when you want changes.

Don't edit files inside a plugin install directory (e.g. `~/.claude/plugins/.../skills/pencil-design/`); the next `/plugin update` will overwrite them.

---

## Plugin System Rules

- The Claude Code plugin manifest MUST live at `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
- The Claude Code marketplace listing MUST live at `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`. This makes the repo installable via `/plugin marketplace add github:Nisus74/pencil-skill` followed by `/plugin install pencil-dev-skill`
- The Cursor plugin manifest MUST live at `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json` (Cursor 2.5+)
- The Codex plugin manifest MUST live at `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`
- `gemini-extension.json` MUST live at the repo root (Gemini CLI requirement)
- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json`, and `gemini-extension.json` MUST carry a `permissions` block matching SKILL.md (enforced by `tools/skill-lint.py`)
- `skills/` MUST be at the repo root
- Each skill is a subdirectory under `skills/` containing one `SKILL.md`
- The YAML frontmatter `description` field controls when the skill activates, so edit it carefully
- Skills may have a `references/` subdirectory for supplementary docs loaded on demand

---

## The Pencil MCP Server

`.pen` files are JSON conforming to a published schema (`Document` with `version`,
`themes`, `imports`, `variables`, `children`). They are version-controllable like
any code file. While they can technically be read with file tools, **all reading
and writing in this project goes through the Pencil MCP server**. It gives you
schema validation, live screenshots, and stays in sync with the running editor:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `get_editor_state` | Get current document state |
| `open_document` | Open a `.pen` file |
| `get_guidelines` | Retrieve design guidelines |
| `batch_get` | Read multiple nodes |
| `batch_design` | Write / modify design nodes |
| `snapshot_layout` | Capture layout state |
| `get_screenshot` | Visual screenshot of the design |
| `get_variables` | Read design tokens / variables |
| `set_variables` | Update design tokens / variables |
| `find_empty_space_on_canvas` | Locate available canvas space |
| `search_all_unique_properties` | Search across design properties |
| `replace_all_matching_properties` | Bulk-replace properties |
| `export_nodes` | Export nodes to external format |

---

## Writing the Skill

When writing or editing `skills/pencil-design/SKILL.md`:

1. The `description` frontmatter field is the trigger mechanism, so include exact phrases users say
2. Keep `SKILL.md` under ~5,000 words; move detailed references to `references/`
3. Use progressive disclosure: core workflow in `SKILL.md`, edge cases in `references/`
4. Always route `.pen` reads/writes through the Pencil MCP tools. Schema validation, screenshots, and live-editor sync depend on it
5. Document tool sequencing (e.g., call `get_editor_state` before `batch_design`)
6. Keep instructions **platform-agnostic**. Use generic verbs ("read", "write", "search")
   rather than tool names where possible. When tool names are necessary, default to the
   Claude Code names and rely on `references/<platform>-tools.md` for mappings.

---

## CI / Hooks

| Hook | Trigger | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| `.github/workflows/secret-scan.yml` | push, PR | Runs gitleaks; blocks merge if secrets are detected |
| `.github/workflows/skill-lint.yml` | push, PR | Runs `tools/skill-lint.py` (OWASP Agentic Skills Top 10) and unit tests |
| `.pre-commit-config.yaml` | local `git commit` | Same skill-lint + gitleaks + basic hygiene; install with `pip install pre-commit && pre-commit install` |

The OWASP AST compliance map lives in [docs/SECURITY.md](./docs/SECURITY.md).

---

## Version Bumping

Follow semantic versioning. Bump the `version` field in four places, keeping them in sync: `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json`, `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, and the `skills/pencil-design/SKILL.md` frontmatter. (`gemini-extension.json` does not declare a version field.)

When the project owner authorises a release, bump the `version` field in four places, keeping them in sync: `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` (inside the `plugins[]` entry), `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json`, and `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`. Follow semantic versioning:

- **PATCH** (`0.x.y`): Content fixes, typos, clarifications
- **MINOR** (`0.y.0`): New capability documented, new trigger phrases added
- **MAJOR** (`x.0.0`): Breaking restructuring of the skill workflow

After bumping, replace the `[Unreleased]` heading in `docs/CHANGELOG.md` with the new version and date.

---

## Testing the Skill Locally

**Claude Code:**
```bash
# From repo root
/plugin install .
# Then describe a pencil task; verify pencil-design skill triggers
```

**Gemini CLI:**
```bash
# Install the extension; AGENTS.md loads automatically as project context
# Describe a pencil task; the skill activates via the description trigger
```

**OpenAI Codex:**
```bash
codex plugin install github:Nisus74/pencil-skill
# Then describe a pencil task; verify pencil-design skill triggers
```

**Copilot CLI:**
```bash
# Skills are auto-discovered from skills/ — no install step needed
```
