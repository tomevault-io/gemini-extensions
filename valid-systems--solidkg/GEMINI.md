# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to Agents when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

SolidKG is a local-first code intelligence library + CLI + MCP server. It parses any supported codebase with tree-sitter, stores symbols, pairwise edges, semantic hyperedges, and files in SQLite (FTS5), and exposes a knowledge graph to AI agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex CLI, opencode, Hermes Agent) over MCP. Per-project data lives in `.solidkg/`. Extraction is deterministic — derived from AST, not LLM-summarized.

Distributed as `solidkg` on npm; same binary serves as installer, indexer, and MCP server.

## Build, Test, Run

Use pnpm for local agent work in this repo. The package scripts are npm-compatible for published users, but do not use bare `npm` while developing here unless a release workflow explicitly requires it.

```bash
pnpm exec tsc           # TypeScript build/check
pnpm run copy-assets    # copy schema.sql and native-grammars.json into dist/
node -e "require('fs').chmodSync('dist/bin/solidkg.js', 0o755)"  # executable bit

pnpm run dev            # tsc --watch
pnpm run clean          # rm -rf dist

pnpm test               # vitest run (all)
pnpm run test:watch

# Single test file / pattern
pnpm exec vitest run __tests__/installer-targets.test.ts
pnpm exec vitest run __tests__/extraction.test.ts -t "TypeScript"
```

`copy-assets` (called from `build`) copies `src/db/schema.sql` and `src/extraction/native-grammars.json` into `dist/`. `prepare:native-runtime` stages the host parser libraries in `.native-grammars/<platform>-<arch>`, and `build-bundle.sh` copies that allowlisted set into the platform bundle.

Node engines: `>=24.0.0`; use Node 24 LTS for local development when possible. The CLI hard-blocks Node <24 unless explicitly overridden (see `src/bin/node-version-check.ts`). Released bundles ship their own Node runtime.

## Public source checkout, repair, and MCP adoption

Use this workflow when an agent is operating in a clone or GitHub source archive on a user's computer. The goal is to prove that the downloaded source is complete before changing any user-level coding-tool configuration.

### Install and prove the checkout

1. Confirm the checkout is running Node 24 and the exact pnpm version in `package.json#packageManager`. If pnpm is unavailable, offer to enable it with Corepack; do not change the user's global toolchain without permission.
2. Install exactly the committed dependency graph and run the complete deterministic readiness suite:

   ```bash
   pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
   pnpm run verify:source:full
   ```

   `verify:source:full` builds from TypeScript, verifies copied SQL/native grammar metadata and the staged host parser libraries, requires every maintained vendored SCIP source tree, indexes a fresh two-file project with real SQLite and tree-sitter, generates/imports/links a real TypeScript SCIP index, exercises library search, starts the real stdio MCP server, calls `solidkg_explore`, checks agent-install diagnostics are read-only, runs every Vitest file present in the checkout, and validates release-package file lists without publishing. The full internal repository contains additional maintainer-only benchmark/evidence contracts that are absent from the initial public archive.
3. The top-level `vendored/` directory is part of the public source contract. It contains pinned SolidKG compatibility variants of the SCIP indexers, including SolidKG-specific changes where official upstream behavior diverges from the integration contract. Do not replace them with upstream HEAD or an arbitrary official binary when reproducing or repairing SolidKG behavior. `pnpm run build` does not compile every polyglot indexer: when the user needs a non-bundled SCIP language, use the matching `vendored/scip-*` README/toolchain, expose the command expected by `src/scip/index.ts` on `PATH`, run `solidkg scip generate --path <project>`, and confirm the generated/imported/linked state with `solidkg status <project>`.

Both `vendored/` and `src/extraction/native-grammars.json` must be present in a public source download. The former preserves the supported indexer implementations; the latter is the allowlist used to stage parser libraries from the pinned language-pack release. Never "repair" either with a floating upstream revision, an empty placeholder, or an arbitrary grammar/indexer binary.

### Correct a failed source install

- Wrong Node major: switch to Node 24, remove only this checkout's `node_modules`, rerun `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`, then rerun the verifier.
- Wrong pnpm version: use the version pinned by `packageManager`; do not weaken or remove `--frozen-lockfile`.
- Lockfile mismatch: stop and inspect the manifest/lock diff. A maintainer must deliberately refresh the appropriate lockfile; do not silently regenerate dependency resolutions just to obtain a pass.
- Missing `src/db/schema.sql` or `src/extraction/native-grammars.json`: treat the download as incomplete and re-clone or re-download the same commit.
- Missing `vendored/scip-*` source or its license/entrypoint: treat the public source archive as incomplete. Re-download the same commit; do not silently substitute an official upstream checkout because it may not contain SolidKG's compatibility changes.
- Missing/stale `dist/` metadata or `.native-grammars/<platform>-<arch>` libraries: run `pnpm run build`; if verification still fails, repair the pinned staging/copy path rather than copying parser files manually.
- Test failure: run the failing Vitest file or named test, fix the underlying source, then rerun `pnpm run verify:source:full`. Do not delete, skip, or loosen a failing test as an installation workaround.
- Platform-specific failure: reproduce on the real affected platform using the Windows VM or Linux Docker procedure below. A pass on another OS is not equivalent evidence.

### Offer to install SolidKG into the user's coding agent

After the source verifier passes, offer—do not silently perform—the following migration:

1. Identify the coding agent or harness the user actually uses and run the read-only diagnostic first:

   ```bash
   node dist/bin/solidkg.js install --check --target all --location global
   ```

2. Explain which config and instruction files would change. If the user wants this source checkout on `PATH`, ask before running `pnpm run install:source`; it writes to the pnpm global package/bin location. A released install may be used instead.
3. With approval, configure the matching target (`claude`, `cursor`, `codex`, `opencode`, `hermes`, `antigravity`, `omp`, or `kimi`):

   ```bash
   solidkg install --target <target> --location <global-or-local>
   ```

   Use `solidkg install --print-config <target>` for a read-only manual snippet when automatic editing is unsupported or the config is malformed.
4. If an existing CodeGraph or other knowledge-graph MCP server is active, show the user the exact competing entry and obtain approval to disable or remove it after SolidKG works. The installer already migrates recognized legacy CodeGraph entries on supported targets and preserves unrelated sibling servers. Do not delete an unknown MCP server, built-in search tool, instruction file, or user customization merely because it appears graph-related.
5. Initialize and verify the user's project, restart the coding agent, and make one real graph call:

   ```bash
   solidkg init -i /path/to/project
   solidkg status /path/to/project
   solidkg install --check --target <target> --location <global-or-local>
   ```

   The acceptance check is that the restarted harness lists `solidkg_explore` and a query returns source plus an answer packet. Only then remove an approved predecessor. If the migration fails, restore the predecessor/config backup and keep the read-only diagnostic output for repair.

## Architecture

### Layered pipeline

```
files → ExtractionOrchestrator (tree-sitter) → DB (nodes/edges/hyperedges/files)
              ↓
       ReferenceResolver (imports, name-matching, framework patterns)
              ↓
       Semantic hyperedge synthesis (route chains, event channels, bridges)
              ↓
       GraphQueryManager / GraphTraverser (callers, callees, impact)
              ↓
       ContextBuilder (markdown/JSON for AI consumption)
```

The public API surface is `src/index.ts` — the `SolidKG` class wires all the layers and re-exports types, including explicit graph snapshots/diffs and package/layer architecture rollups. Library users only touch this file; the MCP server and CLI also drive it.

### Module layout

- `src/index.ts` — `SolidKG` class: `init`/`open`/`close`, `indexAll`, `sync`, `searchNodes`, `getCallers`/`getCallees`, `getImpactRadius`, `getHyperedgesByNode`, `findHyperedgesBetweenNodes`, `buildContext`, `watch`/`unwatch`.
- `src/db/` — `DatabaseConnection`, `QueryBuilder` (prepared statements), `schema.sql`, migrations, and `sqlite-adapter.ts`. Stores files, graph facts, semantic hyperedges, explicit graph snapshots, architecture rollup reports, and SCIP facts. The active backend is Node's built-in `node:sqlite` via a better-sqlite3-shaped adapter; released bundles carry the Node runtime, so there is no native build or wasm fallback in current builds. `solidkg status` surfaces backend and journal mode.
- `src/extraction/` — `ExtractionOrchestrator`, tree-sitter wrappers, per-language extractors under `languages/` (one file per language), plus standalone extractors for non-tree-sitter formats (`svelte-extractor.ts`, `vue-extractor.ts`, `liquid-extractor.ts`, `dfm-extractor.ts` for Delphi). `parse-worker.ts` runs heavy parsing off the main thread.
- `src/resolution/` — `ReferenceResolver` orchestrates `import-resolver.ts` (with `path-aliases.ts` for tsconfig path aliases + cargo workspace member globs), `name-matcher.ts`, `callback-synthesizer.ts`, and `frameworks/` (Express, Laravel, Rails, FastAPI, Django, Flask, Spring, Gin, Axum, ASP.NET, Vapor, React Router, SvelteKit, Vue/Nuxt, Cargo workspaces). Frameworks emit `route` nodes, `references` edges, and relation hints for semantic hyperedge synthesis.
- `src/hypergraph/` — deterministic semantic hyperedge IDs and synthesis from resolved framework/dynamic-dispatch metadata. Hyperedges preserve ordered multi-symbol relationships that pairwise edges flatten.
- `src/graph/` — `GraphTraverser` (BFS/DFS, impact radius, path finding) and `GraphQueryManager` (high-level queries).
- `src/context/` — `ContextBuilder` + formatter for markdown/JSON output.
- `src/overview/` — derived repository overview projection and progressive renderer over indexed files, symbols, and architecture assignments. This is not a second scanner or documentation authority; `.solidkg/` remains the source of truth.
- `src/search/` — full-text query parser and helpers for FTS5.
- `src/sync/` — `FileWatcher` (native FSEvents/inotify/RDCW) with debounce + filter, and git-hook helpers.
- `src/mcp/` — MCP server (`MCPServer`, `tools.ts`, `transport.ts`) plus shared daemon plumbing (`daemon.ts`, `daemon-paths.ts`, `engine.ts`). `server-instructions.ts` is what the server returns in the MCP `initialize` response — keep it in sync with the user-facing tool guidance.
- SCIP support is additive: generated or imported `.scip` indexes provide compiler-grade definitions/references/implementation/type-definition facts on top of the normal AST graph. Keep `solidkg_precise_refs`, status SCIP import/link/generation state, and primary-tool SCIP hints documented together when changing this surface.
- `src/installer/` — see below.
- `src/bin/solidkg.ts` — CLI (commander). Subcommands include `install`, `uninstall`, `init`, `uninit`, `index`, `sync`, `status`, `query`, `files`, `overview`, `context`, `snapshot`, `architecture`, `callers`, `callees`, `impact`, `affected`, `scip generate`, `scip import`, and `serve --mcp`.
- `src/ui/` — terminal UI (shimmer progress, worker).

### NodeKind / EdgeKind / HyperedgeKind

Defined in `src/types.ts`. Both extractors and resolvers must use these exact strings.

- **NodeKind**: `file`, `module`, `class`, `struct`, `interface`, `trait`, `protocol`, `function`, `method`, `property`, `field`, `variable`, `constant`, `enum`, `enum_member`, `type_alias`, `namespace`, `parameter`, `import`, `export`, `route`, `component`.
- **EdgeKind**: `contains`, `calls`, `imports`, `exports`, `extends`, `implements`, `references`, `type_of`, `returns`, `instantiates`, `overrides`, `decorates`.
- **HyperedgeKind**: `route_binding`, `event_channel`, `ui_render`, `dynamic_dispatch`, `native_bridge`, `type_contract`. These are n-ary semantic relationships stored in `hyperedges` + `hyperedge_members`; pairwise edges remain the compatibility/projection layer.

### Multi-agent installer

`src/installer/` is the entry point for `solidkg install` (and the bare `solidkg`/`npx solidkg` invocation). Architecture:

- `targets/registry.ts` lists every supported agent.
- `targets/types.ts` defines the `AgentTarget` interface — adding another agent (Continue, Zed, Windsurf…) is **one new file in `targets/` + one entry in `registry.ts`**. Each target owns its config-file location, MCP-server JSON/TOML/JSONC writing, and instructions-file path.
- Current targets: `claude.ts`, `cursor.ts`, `codex.ts`, `opencode.ts`, `hermes.ts`.
- `targets/toml.ts` is a hand-rolled TOML serializer scoped to `[mcp_servers.solidkg]` (used by Codex). Sibling tables and `[[array_of_tables]]` are preserved verbatim. No new dependency.
- opencode reads `opencode.jsonc` by default; the installer prefers existing `.jsonc`, falls back to `.json`, and creates `.jsonc` for greenfield installs. Edits are surgical via `jsonc-parser` so user comments and formatting survive install/re-install/uninstall round-trips.
- `instructions-template.ts` is the agent-agnostic instructions file written to each target (e.g. `CLAUDE.md`, `.cursor/rules/solidkg.mdc`, `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`, `~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md`). It explicitly says "Prefer SolidKG over broad grep/read loops." and "Fall back to targeted Read only when SolidKG reports stale, truncated, omitted, unreadable, ambiguous, or heuristic-only results." — earlier versions prescribed Claude-specific "spawn an Explore agent" and confused other agents.
- Installed guidance should describe the default compact MCP profile: only `solidkg_explore` is visible, it accepts natural-language structural questions or precise symbol/file terms, and one answer-producing call should usually end discovery.
- Installed guidance should document `SOLIDKG_MCP_TOOLS=all` as the explicit opt-in for trace, precise refs, node, callers/callees/impact, files/overview, snapshots, architecture, status, search, and context.
- Installed guidance should state: source-completeness fields are returned-source coverage only, not answer/path/runtime correctness, confidence, query quality, or global false-path guarantees.
- Installed guidance should define answer packets as deterministic returned-context metadata with evidence anchors, ranking reasons, binary sufficiency, suggested next SolidKG tools, and bounded uncertainty labels — not runtime correctness proof. When an answer packet says the returned context is sufficient, answer from that context instead of drilling further.
- Installed guidance should explain that `source_body_chunk` ranking reasons mean persisted local source-body/code-token chunks seeded or boosted a result, and that exact symbol/path/trace evidence remains higher-salience than body-only evidence.
- Installed guidance should define capability footprints as may-behavior evidence, not runtime proof. Coverage states (`complete`, `partial`, `unsupported`, `failed`, `not_run`, `stale`) describe capability-producer coverage for returned files, and empty assertions do not prove no capability exists.
- Installed guidance should never force follow-up solely because candidate coverage is omitted, truncated, or partial. Follow up only when the answer packet is insufficient because required anchors/source are missing, stale, unreadable, ambiguous, or disconnected.
- Installed guidance should state external dense/vector embeddings, vector databases, rerankers, and hybrid retrieval providers are not enabled by default; optional hybrid extension seams remain disabled unless a future build explicitly supports and configures them.
- `claude-md-template.ts` is the legacy Claude-only template, retained for compatibility paths.
- All installer changes need matching coverage in `__tests__/installer-targets.test.ts` — the parameterized contract tests cover install idempotency, sibling preservation, uninstall reverses install, byte-equal re-runs returning `unchanged`, and partial-state recovery for agent-specific formats.

### Cursor MCP working-directory quirk

Cursor launches MCP subprocesses with the wrong cwd and doesn't pass `rootUri` in `initialize`. The installer injects `--path` into Cursor's MCP args — absolute path for local installs, `${workspaceFolder}` for global installs. If you touch Cursor wiring, preserve this.

### MCP server instructions

`src/mcp/server-instructions.ts` is sent back to the agent in the MCP `initialize` response. This is the *first* thing every agent sees about how to use the exposed profile, so treat it as authoritative provider-neutral guidance and keep it in sync with `instructions-template.ts`, `.cursor/rules/solidkg.mdc`, the README, and public MCP docs. The compact instructions must mention only `solidkg_explore`; the full instructions may describe every advanced tool. Tool-name guidance should preserve raw server names as documented `solidkg_*` names and describe host-added display/permission prefixes as client-specific wrappers, not names to copy into calls. Keep Claude-specific behavior only in Claude target files.

## Retrieval performance & dynamic-dispatch coverage (do not regress)

SolidKG's core value is letting an agent answer **structural/flow** questions ("how does X reach Y", trace, impact, callers) with a few **fast** solidkg calls and **zero Read/Grep**. The optimization target is **wall-clock latency + tool-call count** — *don't optimize for token cost*. In a maintainer-reported matched OpenCode comparison, SolidKG used **16.7% fewer tool calls and 15.9% fewer tokens** than CodeGraph across seven repositories; both products had zero median Read/Grep/Glob calls in every repository. The supporting benchmark report is intentionally not part of the initial public archive. The mechanism that drives everything here: **an agent falls back to Read/Grep the instant a SolidKG answer is insufficient.** So every change is judged by one question — is SolidKG's answer sufficient enough to *stop* the agent from reading?

**Target behavior:** a flow question resolves in **1 solidkg call on small repos, scaling to 3–5 on large**, with **Read/Grep = 0**. When reviewing a PR or trying something new, do not regress this.

### Adapt the tool to the agent — don't try to change the agent

The lever that decides whether a retrieval change lands. **Test before building anything here: does this make a tool the agent _already calls_ do more with the input it _already gives_? If it instead needs the agent to behave differently — pick a different tool, query differently, learn from examples — it hits the low-salience wall and won't land.**

Instruction wording and examples remain low-salience. Tool visibility is different: an unlisted tool cannot be selected, so the default compact MCP profile is a high-salience composition boundary rather than prompt steering. `SOLIDKG_MCP_TOOLS=all` retains the full expert surface without making every ordinary question choose among thirteen tools.

What works is meeting the agent where it already is:
- **Compact answer surface** — the default MCP profile exposes only `solidkg_explore`. It accepts the natural-language question the agent already has and must return enough ranked production source and graph evidence to answer in one call. `SOLIDKG_MCP_TOOLS=all` restores advanced tools for explicit workflows.
- **Sufficiency** — `solidkg_trace` inlines each hop's body/source and the destination's own callees, so one trace call ends the flow investigation for those returned hops (no follow-up explore/node/Read just to fetch them).
- **Answer packets** — high-salience tool outputs include deterministic evidence anchors, ranking reasons, binary returned-context sufficiency, suggested next SolidKG tools, and bounded uncertainty labels so agents can stop or continue for a specific reason. When an answer packet says the returned context is sufficient, answer from that context instead of drilling further. Use solidkg_node for one specific missing symbol or hop, not as a loop over many symbols.
- **Counterfactual concept coverage** — explicit exclusions such as "not tests" or "excluding generated metadata" are retrieval constraints rather than positive terms. If returned source does not cover every explicit concept in that query, `solidkg_explore` emits `missing_query_concept` and a partial packet instead of overstating sufficiency.
- **Source-body chunk evidence** — `solidkg_context`, `solidkg_explore`, and `solidkg_search` can use persisted local source-body/code-token chunks to seed or boost results and surface a `source_body_chunk` ranking reason. This is deterministic local evidence; exact symbols, paths, trace paths, semantic relations, and SCIP facts must still outrank body-only evidence.
- **Disabled hybrid seam** — external dense/vector embeddings, vector databases, rerankers, and hybrid retrieval providers are not enabled by default. Optional extension seams are typed for future experiments only; do not assume LanceDB, API keys, network calls, or telemetry are active.
- **Capability footprints** — high-salience `solidkg_trace` / `solidkg_node` sections summarize may-read/write/guard/emit/subscribe/send/mutate behavior. Treat them as evidence with explicit coverage states, not runtime proof; empty assertions are absence of returned evidence, not proof of no capability.
- **Overview projection** — `solidkg_files format=overview` gives agents a budgeted repository map with language, symbol-kind, conservative anchor, and architecture hints through an existing tool they already call. Keep it derived from indexed facts; do not introduce a parallel filesystem authority.
- **explore-flow** — `solidkg_explore` accepts natural-language questions for retrieval and precise symbol bags for exact flow rendering. Automatic flow endpoints come only from explicit/anchored callable intent; generic prose verbs such as `send` and `request` must not create ambiguity. For precise names (including qualified `Class.method`), explore finds the call path among those symbols using synthesized edges and leads its output with it.
- **Ambiguity beats false confidence** — unqualified duplicate callable names are intentionally conservative: `trace` asks for a qualified/path-qualified endpoint, and `explore` omits the Flow section for unanchored duplicates instead of stitching together unrelated same-name functions.

What fails is requiring a fuzzy-input agent to discover precise endpoints before the tool can help. Retrieval must rank useful production evidence from the natural-language question; exact flow rendering remains conservative and activates only when explicit symbols are present.

The remaining lever under this axis is **coverage**: every flow made to connect statically (a new dynamic-dispatch synthesizer) is then surfaced automatically by explore-flow/`trace`, no agent change needed. Reactive/reconciler runtimes (Halo's `ReactiveExtensionClient`, MediatR, Vue Proxy) are the frontier — flows there have no static edges, so nothing surfaces (correctly — silent beats wrong). The supporting A/B record is maintained privately for the initial public release.

### Explore budget — keep BOTH budgets monotonic with repo size

Two functions in `src/mcp/tools.ts` scale explore with indexed file count. This is the expected resolution (a regression here silently forces agents back to Read):

| Repo | files | explore calls | chars/call | per-file |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| express (small) | 147 | 1 | 18K | 3800 |
| excalidraw/django (medium) | 643–3043 | 2 | 28K | 6500 |
| vscode (large) | 10446 | 3 | 35K | 7000 |
| ~20k / ~40k | — | 4 / 5 | 38K | 7000 |

- `getExploreBudget(fileCount)` → **call** budget: `<500→1, <5000→2, <15000→3, <25000→4, ≥25000→5` (max 5).
- `getExploreOutputBudget(fileCount)` → **per-call** output (chars / files / per-file). **Invariant: a larger tier must never get a smaller `maxCharsPerFile` than a smaller tier.** (Regression that motivated this doc: the `<5000` tier's 2500 was *below* the `<500` tier's 3800, so on a god-file repo — excalidraw's 415 KB `App.tsx` — one explore returned <1% of the file and forced a Read.)
- Explore output must **never tell the agent to "use Read"** for source already returned. Do not follow up solely because peripheral candidate coverage is partial, omitted, or truncated. Prefer SolidKG over broad grep/read loops. Fall back to targeted Read only when the answer packet is insufficient because required source is stale, unreadable, or absent.

### Dynamic-dispatch coverage — the flow must EXIST in the graph end-to-end

Static tree-sitter extraction misses computed/indirect calls, so flows break at dynamic dispatch and the agent reads to reconstruct them. Synthesizers/resolvers bridge these so `trace`/`explore` connect end-to-end (`src/resolution/callback-synthesizer.ts`, `src/resolution/frameworks/`, `src/hypergraph/synthesizer.ts`). Channels today: callback/observer, EventEmitter, **React re-render** (`setState`→`render`), **JSX child** (`render`→child component), django ORM descriptor, and route-chain semantic relations. Synthesized pairwise edges use `provenance:'heuristic'` with `metadata.synthesizedBy` + `registeredAt` (the wiring site), surfaced inline in `trace`, the `node` trail, and `context` call-paths. Multi-symbol shapes that pairwise edges flatten are stored as semantic hyperedges and surfaced in `context`, `node`, and `status`.

**Principle: partial coverage is WORSE than none.** Bridging one boundary but not the next reveals a hop the agent then drills + reads to finish. Measured on excalidraw: react-render alone *raised* reads to 5–7; only completing the flow (adding the jsx-child hop) dropped it to 0–1. **Always close the flow end-to-end and re-measure** — never ship a half-bridged flow.

### Validation methodology (REQUIRED for every new language/framework)

For each **language × framework**, validate on **small, medium, and large** real repos with **≥3 different flow prompts** each:

1. **Pick the canonical flow** for the framework ("how does X reach Y": state→render, request→handler→view, query→SQL, action→reducer→store…).
2. **Deterministic probes** (`scripts/agent-eval/probe-{trace,node,context,explore}.mjs` against the built `dist/`): `trace(from,to)` connects end-to-end with no break; **no node/hyperedge explosion** (`select count(*) from nodes` and `hyperedges` stable before/after re-index); synthesized-edge and semantic-relation **precision** spot-check (`select … where provenance='heuristic'`).
3. **Public pass bar:** the canonical traces connect end-to-end, returned source is sufficient for the named questions, re-indexing does not inflate node/hyperedge counts, and precision spot-checks find no false synthesized links.
4. The broader agent A/B harness, raw trajectories, and coverage matrix are maintainer-only and intentionally omitted from the initial public archive. Do not present a new performance claim as independently reproducible until those materials are published.

Per-mechanism design: `docs/design/callback-edge-synthesis.md`.

### Worked example — Excalidraw (TS/React, medium, 643 files)

The template to replicate per language/framework. Question: *"how does updating an element re-render the canvas on screen?"* (the full flow crosses three React boundaries: observer callback, `setState`→`render`, and JSX child).

| Stage | duration | Read | Grep | solidkg |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Without solidkg | 115–139s | 9–10 | 10–11 | 0 |
| Broken (explore-budget regression) | 131–139s | 5–10 | 3–5 | 6–14 |
| Fixed (budget + msgs + synthesis) | 64–112s | 0–2 | 2–4 | 3–**10** |
| + trace-first steering | **51–74s** | **0–2** | 0–4 | **3–4** |

n=4 unhooked runs/stage, same prompt. After steering flow questions to `solidkg_trace` first: **best run 0 Read / 0 Grep / 3 solidkg / 51s**; **2 of 4 fully clean** (0 Read, 0 Grep). Steering eliminated the over-drill variance — call count tightened from 3–10 to 3–4, trace adoption went 3/4 → 4/4, and the `search`+`callers` path-reconstruction floundering dropped to 0. Run-to-run variance is still real; report the range, never a single run. **Residual reads/greps are all the nonce data-flow** (`canvasNonce` — a local prop with no graph edges); that's the def-use/data-flow frontier, left deliberately uncovered (tracking every local would explode the graph). Validated: `trace(mutateElement, renderStaticScene)` connects in **6 hops** across all three boundaries (`mutateElement → triggerUpdate → [callback] triggerRender → [react-render] render → [jsx] StaticCanvas → renderStaticScene`), each hop showing inline source + the wiring site; node count stable at 9,289; 1 callback + 46 react-render + 280 jsx-render synthesized edges (no explosion, precision-checked).

## Tests

Tests live in `__tests__/` and mirror the module they cover. Notable ones beyond the obvious:

- `installer-targets.test.ts` — parameterized contract suite across all agent targets (see installer notes above).
- Maintainer-only benchmark/evidence harnesses and scoring fixtures are intentionally omitted from the initial public archive. They are not product test dependencies.
- `hypergraph-storage.test.ts`, `hypergraph-synthesis.test.ts`, `hypergraph-traversal.test.ts`, `mcp-hyperedges.test.ts` — semantic hyperedge storage, synthesis, traversal, and MCP surfacing.
- `sqlite-backend.test.ts` — covers the `node:sqlite` adapter and status reporting.
- `pr19-improvements.test.ts`, `frameworks-integration.test.ts` — regression coverage for specific past PRs/incidents; don't rename these, the names anchor to git history.

Tests create temp dirs with `fs.mkdtempSync` and clean up in `afterEach`. They write real files and exercise real SQLite — there is no DB mocking.

### Windows-gated tests

Behavior that differs by platform (path resolution, drive letters, `SENSITIVE_PATHS`, `%APPDATA%` config dirs, CRLF) must be gated, not assumed. Use `it.runIf(process.platform === 'win32')(...)` for Windows-only assertions and `it.runIf(process.platform !== 'win32')(...)` for POSIX-only ones — e.g. `/etc` is sensitive on POSIX but resolves to `C:\etc` (non-existent) on Windows, so an ungated `/etc` assertion fails on Windows. Validate the Windows side for real (see below); don't merge a Windows-gated test you haven't seen run.

## Cross-platform validation

When a change is platform-sensitive (file watching, sockets / named pipes, path & symlink handling, process lifecycle, inotify budget), validate the relevant platform for real rather than guessing. Do not treat a passing local run as coverage for OS-specific behavior.

### Linux (Docker)

When asked to test or validate on Linux, use **Docker** — there's no Linux box, but Docker runs on the macOS host. Build a throwaway image from the repo and run the suite inside it:

- `FROM node:22-bookworm`; `COPY` the repo with a `.dockerignore` excluding `node_modules`/`dist`/`.git`/`.solidkg`; `RUN npm ci && npm run build`. Don't reuse the Mac `node_modules` — `esbuild`/`rollup` ship platform-specific binaries.
- Run with **`docker run --rm --init`**. The `--init` is load-bearing for any process-lifecycle test (daemon reaping, the #277 PPID watchdog, idle-timeout): without a zombie-reaping PID 1, a SIGKILL'd/exited process lingers as a zombie and `process.kill(pid, 0)` still reports it *alive*, so exit-detection assertions false-fail even though the process did exit.
- Linux is where the inotify watch budget actually bites: count a process's watches via `/proc/<pid>/fdinfo/*` (sum `^inotify ` lines on the fd whose `readlink` is `anon_inode:inotify`).

### Windows (Parallels VM + SSH)

For any Windows-specific PR, bug, or implementation, validate it on the real Windows VM rather than guessing. Connection details live in the gitignored **`.parallels`** file at the repo root (VM name, guest IP, SSH user/key). `prlctl exec` needs Parallels Pro and is unavailable, so SSH is the bridge.

- Connect / run from the Mac host: `ssh <user>@<guest_ip> "..."`. For multi-line work, pipe PowerShell over stdin and **refresh PATH from the registry** first (sshd's session has a stale PATH after winget installs):
  ```
  ssh colby@10.211.55.3 "powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command -" <<'PS'
  $env:Path = [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path","Machine") + ";" + [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path","User")
  Set-Location C:\dev\solidkg
  PS
  ```
- Clone fresh into a **Windows-local** path (`C:\dev\solidkg`) and `npm ci` there — never run npm against the shared Mac repo, since `esbuild`/`rollup` ship platform-specific binaries.
- Guest toolchain (winget): Node LTS, Git, and the **VC++ ARM64 redistributable** (required by `@rollup/rollup-win32-arm64-msvc`, which vitest pulls in).
- Fetch a contributor PR head straight from their fork to dodge `pull/<n>/head` lag: `git fetch <fork-url> <branch>` then `git checkout -f FETCH_HEAD`.
- Known pre-existing Windows failures (they reproduce on `main`, unrelated to your change — confirm against `origin/main` before blaming your PR, and don't let them mask new regressions): `security.test.ts > Session marker symlink resistance > does not follow a pre-planted symlink` (symlink creation needs privileges on Windows); and the `mcp-initialize.test.ts` / `mcp-roots.test.ts` suites, which fail in `afterEach` with `EPERM` removing the temp dir because a spawned `serve --mcp` (its `--liftoff-only` re-exec grandchild) still holds the cwd / SQLite file open — a Windows file-locking quirk, not a logic bug.

## Releases

Released to npm and mirrored as [GitHub Releases](https://solidkg.local/repository/releases). Release notes are generated by GitHub during the Release workflow; this repository does not maintain a root changelog.

### Release flow (the user runs these)

Releases are built and published by the **GitHub Actions "Release" workflow**
(`.github/workflows/release.yml`). It bundles a Node runtime per platform (`scripts/build-bundle.sh`)
and publishes both the GitHub Release and the npm thin-installer
(`scripts/pack-npm.sh`: a shim package + per-platform packages).
Publishing manually is **wrong** now — a plain `npm publish` ships the root
package (non-bundled), which breaks anyone on Node < 22.5.

**Agents do NOT bump the version unless explicitly asked.** The maintainer
typically does it themselves — often by editing `package.json` directly via
the GitHub web UI. Don't proactively commit a version bump as part of
unrelated work, and don't propose one when summarizing a PR.

When the maintainer DOES bump the version, the only edit strictly required is
to `package.json` — the workflow's "Sync package-lock.json" step detects a
mismatch between `package.json` and `package-lock.json`, runs
`npm install --package-lock-only --ignore-scripts` to rewrite the lock file's
version fields (top-level + `packages.""`), and auto-commits + pushes the
result back to `main` with `[skip ci]`. So a GitHub-web-UI single-file edit to
`package.json` is enough to kick off a clean release. (If they edit both files
locally, that's fine too — the sync step no-ops.)

Once `package.json` is at the target version on `main`, trigger
**Actions → Release → Run workflow** (on `main`). The workflow:

1. Syncs `package-lock.json` to `package.json`'s version if they've drifted; commits + pushes that change.
2. Builds every platform bundle on one runner, generates `SHA256SUMS`.
3. Creates the GitHub Release with GitHub-generated notes.
4. Publishes the npm shim + per-platform packages. Requires the `NPM_TOKEN` repo secret.

**Do not run `npm publish`, `git push`, or `git tag` yourself** — these are
publish actions on shared state. Write the files, hand the user the commands.

## House rules

- Any change to `src/installer/` (especially `targets/`) needs corresponding test coverage — installer regressions break every new install silently.
- When changing what the MCP tools do or how agents should use them, update **all four** of `src/mcp/server-instructions.ts`, `src/installer/instructions-template.ts`, `.cursor/rules/solidkg.mdc`, and `AGENTS.md` — they're written to different places but should say the same thing. Public behavior changes also need README/site docs.
- For upstream monitoring against `colbymchenry/codegraph`, follow `docs/maintenance/upstream-watch.md`, check `docs/maintenance/upstream-divergence.md`, and use `.upstream-watch/` plus `scripts/upstream-watch/report.mjs`. Upstream is a reference feed, not the source of truth for this fork's more advanced local behavior. This is a release-diff triage workflow only; never blindly apply upstream updates, merge, cherry-pick, rebase, tag, push, publish, or update `.upstream-watch/state.json` without explicit maintainer approval.
- SolidKG provides **code context**, not product requirements. For new features, ask the user about UX, edge cases, and acceptance criteria — the graph won't tell you.
