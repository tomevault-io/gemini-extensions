# B2C CLI

This is a monorepo project with the following packages:
- `./packages/b2c-cli` - the command line interface built with oclif
- `./packages/b2c-tooling-sdk` - the SDK/library for B2C Commerce operations; supports the CLI and can be used standalone
- `./packages/b2c-dx-mcp` - Model Context Protocol server; also built with oclif
- `./packages/b2c-vs-extension` - VS Code extension (not published to npm; packaged as VSIX and versioned via git tags)
- `./docs` - documentation site (private `@salesforce/b2c-dx-docs` workspace package; not published to npm)

## Common Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Build all packages
pnpm run build

# Build specific package
pnpm --filter @salesforce/b2c-cli run build
pnpm --filter @salesforce/b2c-tooling-sdk run build

# Dev mode for CLI (uses source files directly)
pnpm --filter @salesforce/b2c-cli run dev
# or using convenience script
./cli
```

## Commands for Coding Agents

These commands produce condensed output optimized for AI coding agents:

```bash
# Run tests (minimal output - only failures + summary)
pnpm run test:agent

# Run tests for specific package
pnpm --filter @salesforce/b2c-cli run test:agent
pnpm --filter @salesforce/b2c-tooling-sdk run test:agent

# Lint (errors only, no warnings); Be sure to run lint before committing or writing a changeset
pnpm run lint:agent

# Type-check (single-line errors, no color)
pnpm run typecheck:agent

# Format check (lists only files needing formatting)
pnpm run -r format:check
```

## Verbose Commands (Debugging/CI)

Use these for detailed output during debugging or in CI pipelines:

```bash
# Run tests with full output and coverage
pnpm run test

# Run tests for specific package
pnpm --filter @salesforce/b2c-cli run test
pnpm --filter @salesforce/b2c-tooling-sdk run test

# Format code with prettier
pnpm run -r format

# Lint with full output
pnpm run -r lint
```

## Copyright Header

All TypeScript source files must include this exact copyright header block:

```typescript

 * SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2
 * For full license text, see the license.txt file in the repo root or http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0

```

The header is enforced by eslint via `eslint-plugin-header`. The canonical definition is in `eslint.config.mjs` (root) as `copyrightHeader`.

## Setup/Packaging

- use `pnpm` over `npm` for package management
- shared dependencies are managed via [pnpm catalogs](https://pnpm.io/catalogs) — versions are defined once in the `catalog:` section of `pnpm-workspace.yaml` and referenced as `"catalog:"` in each package.json. When adding or updating a dependency that is shared across packages, update the catalog entry rather than individual package.json files.
- the `pnpm run test` commands also run the linter after tests
- use `pnpm run -r format` (or individually in packages) to format code with prettier
- use `exports` field in package.json files to define public API surface for packages; use `development` field for nodejs --conditions for development ergonomics (packages/b2c-cli/bin/dev.js will use this condition)

## Documentation

- Update docs in `./docs/` folder and relevant skills in `./skills/b2c-cli/skills/` when updating or adding CLI commands.
- When adding new SDK modules, update `docs/typedoc.json` entry points to include the new module's barrel file so API docs are generated.

See [documentation skill](./.claude/skills/documentation/SKILL.md) for details on updating user guides, CLI reference, and API docs.

```bash
# Run docs dev server (from project root)
pnpm run docs:dev

# Build docs for production (stable mode — root base path)
pnpm run docs:build

# Build docs in dev mode (/dev/ base path)
IS_DEV_BUILD=true pnpm run docs:build
```

### Docs workspace package

The `./docs` directory is a private workspace package (`@salesforce/b2c-dx-docs`) with a dependency on `@salesforce/b2c-tooling-sdk`. This exists to support doc-only releases and changelog tracking via changesets, not for npm publishing. It has no build script — `pnpm -r run build` skips it.

**Deployed URL structure:** stable/released docs are served at the root URL, dev docs (from `main`) live at `/dev/`.

**Doc-only releases:** to release documentation changes without bumping CLI/SDK/MCP, create a changeset that targets only the docs package:

```md
---
'@salesforce/b2c-dx-docs': patch
---

Improved authentication guide with step-by-step examples
```

This produces a `docs@<version>` tag and triggers a docs rebuild on merge of the version PR.

**Automatic cascade:** because the docs package depends on the SDK, when the SDK version is bumped by a changeset, `updateInternalDependencies: "patch"` auto-bumps the docs version too — triggering a docs rebuild (correct since API docs are generated from the SDK).

## Logging

- when logging use the logger instance from `@salesforce/b2c-tooling-sdk/logger` package
- CLI commands have access to this logger via `this.log` method from oclif Command class
- CLI commands can write directly to stdout/stderr if their primary purpose is to output or stream data

## CLI Command Development

See [CLI command development skill](./.claude/skills/cli-command-development/SKILL.md) for patterns.

## Claude Code Skills

**User-facing skills** (for CLI users): `./skills/b2c-cli/skills/` - update when modifying CLI commands.

**Developer skills** (for contributors): `./.claude/skills/` - covers:
- [CLI command development](./.claude/skills/cli-command-development/SKILL.md) - oclif commands, flags, table output
- [SDK module development](./.claude/skills/sdk-module-development/SKILL.md) - modules, exports, barrel files
- [API client development](./.claude/skills/api-client-development/SKILL.md) - OpenAPI clients, OAuth scopes, SCAPI patterns
- [Testing](./.claude/skills/testing/SKILL.md) - Mocha, Chai, MSW patterns
- [Documentation](./.claude/skills/documentation/SKILL.md) - user guides, CLI reference, API docs

## Pre-Commit Checks

Before committing code, always run lint to catch formatting and style issues:

```bash
pnpm run lint:agent
```

This catches prettier formatting, import ordering, class member ordering (`perfectionist/sort-classes`), and other issues that will fail CI.

## Testing

See [testing skill](./.claude/skills/testing/SKILL.md) for patterns on writing tests with Mocha, Chai, and MSW.

**Stdout in tests**: Command tests must not leak output to the console. `stubCommandConfigAndLogger()` silences `command.log`, `command.logToStderr`, and `ux.stdout` automatically. For other cases, use `runSilent()` from `test/helpers/test-setup.ts`.

## Changesets

This project uses [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) for version management with **independent per-package versioning**. Each package versions independently based on its own changesets.

**How it works:**
- A changeset affecting only the SDK bumps only the SDK version
- Packages that depend on a bumped package get an automatic patch bump (via `updateInternalDependencies: "patch"`) — e.g., if SDK bumps, CLI, MCP, and Docs all auto-get a patch bump
- Only packages with a newer version than what's on npm get published (docs package is private and uses git tags instead)
- A changeset targeting only `@salesforce/b2c-dx-docs` triggers a doc-only release — no npm packages are published, just a `docs@<version>` tag and docs rebuild

Changeset guidelines:
- Create a changeset for any user-facing changes (features, bug fixes); typically in new pull requests
- a pull request can have multiple changesets; separate files for separate changes
- Only list directly-changed packages in changeset frontmatter — do not include dependent packages (they get auto-bumped)
- Select the appropriate semver bump: `patch` (bug fixes) or `minor` (new features)
- Use `major` for breaking changes that require consumers to update their code
- Good changesets explain:
  - WHAT the change is
  - WHY the change was made
  - HOW a consumer should update their code
- Good changesets are brief and user-focused (not contributor); they are generally 1 line or two; The content of the changeset is used in CHANGELOG and release notes. You do not need to list internal implementation details or all details of commands; just the high level summary for users.

Valid changeset packages: `@salesforce/b2c-cli`, `@salesforce/b2c-tooling-sdk`, `@salesforce/b2c-dx-mcp`, `@salesforce/mrt-utilities`, `b2c-vs-extension`, `@salesforce/b2c-dx-docs`, `@salesforce/b2c-agent-plugins`

Create a changeset file directly in `.changeset/` with a unique filename (e.g., `descriptive-change-name.md`):

```md
---
'@salesforce/b2c-cli': patch
'@salesforce/b2c-tooling-sdk': patch
---

Description of the change explaining WHAT, WHY, and HOW to update
```

- Include only the packages that were directly modified
- For doc-only changes, target `@salesforce/b2c-dx-docs` instead of the CLI/SDK/MCP packages
- For changes to agent skills/plugins in `skills/` (adding or updating skill content, adding a new plugin), target `@salesforce/b2c-agent-plugins`
