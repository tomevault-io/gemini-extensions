> Slack Notification Rule for User Input Requirements


# 📱 Slack Notification Rule for User Input

This rule automatically sends Slack notifications when Cascade needs user input for file changes, terminal operations, or any manual intervention.

## Rule Activation

This rule is automatically triggered when ANY of these conditions occur:
- File changes have been accepted and system is ready to test
- Work has been completed and successfully pushed to git
- Terminal command needs user input (passwords, confirmations)
- Manual intervention is required for any operation
- Process is blocked waiting for user action

## Notification Triggers

### 1. Build/Test Ready Notifications
**Trigger**: When file changes have been accepted and the system is ready to proceed with testing
```bash
# Detection pattern: File changes accepted, build/test environment ready
# Notification: "🚀 Ready to test - Build environment prepared"
# Action: Send Slack message when all changes are accepted and testing can begin
```

### 2. Git Push Complete Notifications
**Trigger**: When work has been completed and successfully pushed to git
```bash
# Detection pattern: Git push completed successfully
# Notification: "✅ Work completed and pushed to git"
# Action: Send Slack message when changes are committed and pushed
```

### 3. Terminal Input Required
**Trigger**: When terminal command waits for user input
```bash
# Detection patterns:
# - Password prompts: "Password:", "Enter password"
# - Y/N confirmations: "Continue? [y/n]", "Are you sure? [y/n]"
# - Any input prompt: "Press Enter to continue", "Input required"

# Notification: "⚠️ Terminal input required - [command details]"
# Action: Send Slack message with command and input needed
```

### 4. Process Blocked Notifications
**Trigger**: When any process is blocked waiting for user action
```bash
# Detection patterns:
# - Hanging processes (>30 seconds)
# - Interactive prompts
# - Manual intervention required

# Notification: "🚫 Process blocked - needs manual intervention"
# Action: Send Slack message with process details
```

## Automatic Notification System

### Slack Integration Setup
The rule uses the configured Slack MCP server with these parameters:
- **Bot Token**: Configured in MCP settings
- **Default Channel**: Your DM channel
- **Message Format**: Structured with emojis and context
- **Priority Levels**: Based on urgency of input needed

### Message Templates

#### Git Push Complete Template
```
✅ **Work Completed & Pushed**

🎯 **Status**: Successfully pushed to git
📁 **Repository**: [repository name]
🌿 **Branch**: [branch name]
📝 **Commit**: [commit message/ID]
📊 **Files**: [number] files committed
⏰ **Time**: [timestamp]

💡 _All work has been completed and pushed to git successfully_
```

#### Build/Test Ready Template
```
� **Ready to Test**

✅ **File Changes**: Accepted and ready
� **Environment**: Build/test environment prepared
� **Files Modified**: [number] files processed
⏰ **Time**: [timestamp]
🎯 **Action**: Testing can now proceed automatically

💡 _All file changes have been accepted and Cascade is ready to continue with testing_
```

#### Terminal Input Template
```
⚠️ **Terminal Input Required**

💻 **Command**: [command that needs input]
🔑 **Input Type**: [password/confirmation/other]
📝 **Prompt**: [exact prompt text]
⏰ **Time**: [timestamp]

💡 _Cascade is waiting for your input to continue the command_
```

#### Process Blocked Template
```
🚫 **Process Blocked**

🔄 **Process**: [process name/command]
⏱️ **Duration**: [time blocked]
📍 **Location**: [working directory]
🎯 **Action**: Manual intervention required

💡 _Cascade is blocked and needs your help to continue_
```

## Implementation Details

### 1. Build/Test Ready Detection
```bash
# Monitor for file changes acceptance and build readiness
monitor_build_readiness() {
  # Wait for file changes to be accepted by user
  # Check if build/test environment is ready
  # Send notification when ready to proceed
  # Only notify after acceptance, not before
}
```

### 2. Git Push Detection
```bash
# Monitor for successful git push operations
monitor_git_push_complete() {
  # Detect git push completion
  # Extract commit details and repository info
  # Send success notification with commit details
  # Only notify on successful push
}
```

### 3. Terminal Input Detection
```bash
# Monitor terminal processes for input prompts
monitor_terminal_input() {
  # Scan for password prompts
  # Detect Y/N confirmations  
  # Identify any interactive prompts
  # Send notification with details
}
```

### 4. Process Monitoring
```bash
# Monitor for blocked processes
monitor_blocked_processes() {
  # Check for processes waiting > 30 seconds
  # Detect hanging operations
  # Send notification for manual intervention
}
```

## Notification Logic

### Priority Levels
1. **HIGH** (Immediate): Git push complete notifications
2. **HIGH** (Immediate): Build/test ready notifications
3. **MEDIUM** (5 min delay): Terminal input needed
4. **LOW** (10 min delay): Process monitoring alerts

### Rate Limiting
- **Max notifications**: 3 per hour
- **Cooldown period**: 15 minutes between similar notifications
- **Build ready batching**: Only notify once when all changes are accepted
- **Git push batching**: Only notify once per successful push operation

### Smart Filtering
- **Wait for acceptance**: Don't notify about pending file changes
- **Ready-state only**: Only notify when system is ready to proceed
- **Context awareness**: Different notifications for different scenarios

## Integration with Skills

- Coordinates with notification system for ready-state notifications

## Configuration Options

### Notification Settings
```json
{
  "slack_notifications": {
    "enabled": true,
    "default_channel": "@your_username",
    "priority_levels": {
      "git_push_complete": "HIGH",
      "build_ready": "HIGH",
      "terminal_input": "MEDIUM", 
      "process_blocked": "MEDIUM"
    },
    "rate_limits": {
      "max_per_hour": 3,
      "cooldown_minutes": 15
    },
    "filters": {
      "wait_for_acceptance": true,
      "ready_state_only": true,
      "git_success_only": true,
      "batch_similar": true,
      "context_aware": true
    }
  }
}
```

### Custom Message Templates
```json
{
  "message_templates": {
    "git_push_complete": "✅ Work completed and pushed to git",
    "build_ready": "🚀 Build environment ready - Testing can proceed",
    "terminal_input": "⚠️ Terminal needs input: {command}",
    "process_blocked": "🚫 Process blocked: {process}"
  }
}
```

## Testing and Verification

### Test Scenarios
1. **Build Ready**: Make file changes, accept them, verify notification when ready
2. **Git Push Complete**: Commit and push changes, verify success notification
3. **Terminal Input**: Run a command that needs user input
4. **Process Block**: Create a hanging process scenario
5. **Rate Limiting**: Send multiple notifications to verify limits

### Verification Steps
1. **Notification Received**: Check Slack for message
2. **Message Content**: Verify all required details are included
3. **Timing**: Check notification timing is appropriate
4. **Actionability**: Ensure message provides clear next steps

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **No Notifications**: Check Slack bot permissions and token
2. **Too Many Notifications**: Adjust rate limiting settings
3. **Wrong Channel**: Verify default channel configuration
4. **Missing Context**: Update message templates

### Debug Mode
```bash
# Enable debug logging
export SLACK_NOTIFICATIONS_DEBUG=true

# Test notification manually
send_test_notification()
```
