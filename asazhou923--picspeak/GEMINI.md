This file gives Claude Code project-specific guidance for working in this repository.

## Project Overview

PicSpeak is an AI photo critique and visual-reference generation web app. Users can upload photos for structured AI photography feedback, browse review history and gallery content, and generate AI reference images from prompts, templates, or review improvement suggestions.

Core product areas:

- Photo upload, AI critique, scoring, and retake suggestions
- Guest and authenticated usage with quotas and upgrade paths
- Public gallery, blog, changelog/updates, SEO metadata, and llms.txt support
- AI image generation with templates, tasks, generated image detail pages, history, credits, and credit-pack billing
- Review-to-generation loop for composition, lighting, color, and retake reference images
- Review-to-workspace retake targets, history practice themes, and in-task Blog reading during critique/generation waits
- Operational health snapshots for task status, AI costs, credits, payments, and public-content audits

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 App Router, React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: FastAPI, SQLAlchemy 2.x, Alembic, Uvicorn
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Object storage**: Cloudflare R2 / S3-compatible storage
- **AI critique**: OpenAI-compatible vision LLM endpoints, with Flash and Pro model settings
- **AI generation**: OpenAI-compatible image generation endpoint, task queue, credit pricing, and object-storage persistence
- **Task processing**: In-process async worker by default, optional standalone worker and Cloud Tasks configuration
- **Authentication**: Clerk plus legacy Google OAuth/guest JWT support
- **Billing**: Lemon Squeezy Pro checkout, activation codes, image credit packs, and webhooks

- `core/config.py` - Environment-backed settings via `pydantic-settings`

### Backend scripts and schema

- `backend/alembic/` - Alembic migrations
- `backend/scripts/ensure_runtime_schema.py` - Runtime schema guard used during local startup/deploys
- `create_schema.sql` - Full schema snapshot, useful for reviewing table/index intent

### Frontend (`frontend/src/`)

- `app/` - App Router routes, including workspace, reviews, tasks, gallery, generate, generation tasks/details, account pages, blog, updates, localized pages, robots, sitemap, and llms.txt routes
- `features/workspace/` - Upload flow, quota display, mode/image type pickers, and replay context
- `features/reviews/` - Review detail hooks and UI panels, including action bar, gallery publishing, growth loop, retake target handoff, and reference generation
- `features/generations/` - Generation contracts, config, and prompt example UI
- `components/` - Shared auth, billing, blog, gallery, home, layout, marketing, provider, upload, and UI components
- `content/` - Blog, updates, generation prompt examples, and review copy/content bundles
- `lib/` - API client, auth context, i18n, locale routing, SEO helpers, llms.txt content, checkout helpers, analytics, EXIF/compression/canvas utilities, and shared types
- `test/` - Node test-runner coverage for content, SEO, i18n, conversion copy, generation prompts, and UI support utilities

## Key Flows

### Photo critique

1. Frontend requests a presigned upload URL from `POST /api/v1/uploads/presign`.
2. Browser uploads directly to object storage.
3. Frontend creates the photo record and review task.
4. Review task enters `PENDING -> RUNNING -> SUCCEEDED | FAILED | EXPIRED`.
5. Task status is surfaced via polling/WebSocket routes, then the user lands on the review detail page.

### AI image generation

1. User starts from `/generate`, prompt examples, or a review reference-generation panel.
2. Backend creates an image generation task and prices it against generation credits.
3. Worker executes the OpenAI-compatible image generation request, stores the result in object storage, and writes generated image records.
4. Frontend routes through `/generation-tasks/[taskId]` to `/generations/[generationId]`.
5. Users can download, copy prompts, reuse settings, view account history, or send a result back to the workspace as retake inspiration.

### Auth and quota

- Clerk is the primary auth provider.
- Guest sessions use signed JWT cookies and can later upgrade.
- Quotas are tracked through `usage_ledger` and related helpers by IP, user identity, endpoint/category, plan, and generation credit balance.
- Idempotency matters for creation endpoints; keep `Idempotency-Key` behavior intact when touching task creation.

### SEO, locale, and content

- English, Chinese, and Japanese content is represented across `i18n-*.ts`, localized routes, blog/update JSON files, and SEO helpers.
- `/generate/prompts` and `/generate/prompts/[id]` are crawlable GPT Image 2 prompt-example pages backed by `content/generation/prompt-examples.ts`; keep static params, metadata, JSON-LD, localized visible titles, and sitemap entries aligned.
- `/gallery` intentionally renders a server-visible SEO summary before the client gallery loads; keep `GallerySeoHero`, `gallery-seo-copy.ts`, and gallery metadata in sync when editing public gallery positioning.
- `frontend/public/og-product.png` is the primary 1200x630 product social preview for AI critique, AI Create, and gallery examples; update `siteConfig` and `seo-assets` coverage together if replacing it.
- `robots.ts`, `sitemap.ts`, `/sitemap-images.xml`, `/sitemap-news.xml`, `llms.txt` routes, `.well-known/llms.txt`, `frontend/public/llms.txt`, `/ai-content/*.md` Markdown mirrors, and the `/generate` SEO fallback are part of the AI-search/GEO surface.
- `/generation-tasks/[taskId]` and `/generations/[generationId]` are private generation-flow surfaces and should remain `noindex`.
- Keep canonical URLs, locale alternates, structured data, and content bundle tests aligned when editing public pages.

## Environment Configuration

Backend values live in `backend/.env` and are documented by `backend/.env.example`. Important groups include:

- Database: `DATABASE_URL`
- Security/auth: `APP_SECRET`, `OAUTH_JWT_SECRET`, Clerk secrets, Google OAuth values
- Storage: `OBJECT_*`
- Critique AI: `AI_API_BASE_URL`, `AI_API_KEY`, `AI_MODEL_NAME`, `FLASH_MODEL_NAME`, `PRO_MODEL_NAME`
- Generation AI: `IMAGE_GENERATION_API_KEY`, `IMAGE_GENERATION_*`
- Workers/queue: `RUN_EMBEDDED_WORKER`, `REVIEW_WORKER_*`, `CLOUD_TASKS_*`
- Billing: `LEMONSQUEEZY_*`
- Frontend/CORS: `FRONTEND_ORIGIN`, `BACKEND_CORS_ORIGINS`

Frontend values live in `frontend/.env.local`; `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` and site/public auth values are the most common local-edit targets.

## Development Notes

- Prefer existing route/service/helper patterns before adding new abstractions.
- Keep backend task state changes transactional and idempotent.
- Do not bypass quota, credit, or guest/auth helpers when adding new creation endpoints.
- When touching image generation, update pricing, task processor, API schemas, frontend contracts, and tests together.
- When touching public pages, update localized copy and SEO tests together.
- Use `serializeJsonLd()` for inline JSON-LD scripts, and reuse shared date, locale, and checkout helpers before reintroducing page-local copies.
- Header visibility is intentionally split: `showUsageNav` and `showMobileTabs` are public navigation, while authenticated account controls still wait for hydrated non-guest user state.
- Keep `docs/changelog/CHANGELOG.md`, `/updates` docPath anchors, and the external Update Logs mirror synchronized for user-facing feature work.

## Verification Checklist

Use the smallest verification set that proves the change:

- Backend route/service changes: targeted `pytest` file(s), then broader `backend/tests` when shared behavior changed
- Frontend TypeScript changes: `npm run typecheck`
- Frontend lint-sensitive changes: `npm run lint`
- Content/SEO/i18n changes: `node --test test/*.test.ts` or targeted files under `frontend/test`
- Production-facing frontend changes: `npm run build`

If a command cannot be run locally, report exactly which command was skipped and why.
