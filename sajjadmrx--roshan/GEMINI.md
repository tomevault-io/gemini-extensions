# AGENTS.md

Guidance for anyone, human or coding agent, working on Roshan. Read this
before changing code. User-facing docs are in [README.md](README.md),
build details in [docs/DEVELOPMENT.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md), and
contribution rules in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## What Roshan is

A small, private desktop utility (Rust + GPUI). Users save **sessions**
("Morning", "Deep work"…): ordered lists of real apps, shell commands and
links. Pressing **Run** launches them one by one, with an optional pause after
each item. Roshan opens at sign-in (can be turned off) and waits idle, so the
computer boots light and the user's setup starts when they decide.

It is **not** a startup manager, process manager, optimizer, automation
platform or tracker. Reject features that push it in those directions.

## Non-negotiable rules

- **Real data only.** Never add demo entries, a built-in app catalog,
  hardcoded app names, or bundled third-party icons. App names and icons come
  from the OS at runtime. Test fixtures stay inside `#[cfg(test)]`.
- **Private.** No accounts, telemetry or analytics. The update check in
  `roshan-platform/src/update.rs` is the **only** network access: GitHub's
  latest-release API plus, on Windows, the release's `Roshan-Setup-*.exe`
  and `SHA256SUMS.txt`. No user data is sent. Do not add other requests.
- **Honest status.** Report only what the OS told us: `Launched`, `Failed`
  (with the OS reason) or `Skipped`. Never claim an app is "running" or
  "ready".
- **Light.** No background services, no filesystem scanning while idle.
  Discovery runs only when the app picker opens; icons load lazily and are
  cached on disk.
- **Never write to a broken config.** If `roshan.toml` cannot be parsed, it is
  moved aside, never overwritten.
- **Commits.** Use only the repository owner's git identity. Do not add
  AI co-author trailers or "generated with" lines to commits or PRs.

                      Windows installer silently to update
  roshan/             The GPUI app.
    main.rs           args (--run, --startup, --updated, --version), window setup

    view.rs           root view, title bar, overlays host

vendor/gpui-pre-windows/  Patched GPUI Windows backend (see ROSHAN_PATCH.md)
docs/                 DEVELOPMENT.md, media/ (posters and their HTML sources)
packaging/windows/    Inno Setup installer (roshan.iss) + build-installer.ps1
packaging/linux/      .desktop file
```

Keep the dependency direction: `roshan` → `roshan-platform` → `roshan-core`.
OS code belongs only in `roshan-platform`, behind `#[cfg]` modules with the
same function set per OS.

## Commands

```sh
cargo build                     # debug build
cargo run                       # run the app
cargo test                      # all unit tests (Windows: 30+)
cargo fmt --all
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo run -p roshan-platform --example list_apps [filter]   # see discovery
```

Before finishing any change: `fmt`, `clippy -D warnings` and `test` must pass.
The macOS and Linux platform code can be type-checked from Windows:

```sh
rustup target add aarch64-apple-darwin x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
cargo clippy -p roshan-core -p roshan-platform --target aarch64-apple-darwin --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo clippy -p roshan-core -p roshan-platform --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu --all-targets -- -D warnings
```

Cross-checking needs a C cross compiler for the target, because the HTTPS
stack (`ring`) builds C code. Without one, rely on CI: the Linux job compiles
and lints all non-Windows code natively. The full GPUI app cannot be
cross-compiled either.

## Testing the UI safely

- Set `ROSHAN_CONFIG=<path>` to use a throwaway sessions file. Never test
  against the user's real `roshan.toml`.
- Only one instance runs at a time (named mutex on Windows); close Roshan
  before starting another build.
- Finishing the welcome screen enables start-at-login
  (`HKCU\...\CurrentVersion\Run`, value `Roshan`). Remove that entry after
  testing with a debug build.
- Test updates against a local fake release: build two installers with
  `packaging/windows/build-installer.ps1` (e.g. 1.0.0 and 1.0.1), install the
  first, serve a `release.json` shaped like GitHub's API with the second
  installer and its `SHA256SUMS.txt`, and set
  `ROSHAN_UPDATE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:<port>/release.json`. Downloads land in
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Roshan\updates`. Uninstall afterwards, and never answer
  "Yes" to deleting sessions on a machine with real user data.
- The daily check records `last_update_check` in the config; remove it to
  check again right away.
- Running a session really launches apps. Prefer harmless targets
  (Calculator, Notepad, `echo`) and close what you opened.

## Text and translations

- Every user-facing string lives in `crates/roshan/locales/*.toml`; add new
  keys to **every** language. Tests check missing keys and lost
  `{placeholders}`.
- Persian follows [TYPOGRAPHY.md](TYPOGRAPHY.md): casual tone («رو»),
  no tanween, no trailing periods, no `!`, real ZWNJ half-spaces, Persian
  digits, «،» instead of «·», «روتین» for session. A test enforces the
  mechanical rules.
- GPUI cannot wrap right-to-left paragraphs: break long Persian strings with
  `\n` (about 40 characters per line). `I18n::directional` wraps each line
  in an RTL embedding; use `I18n::join` to combine fragments.
- Build layouts with `ui::hrow` / `ui::vstack` so they mirror in RTL.

## Design rules

- Palette from the logo: charcoal tile, cream bowl, one amber light.
- Primary actions are solid (`p.primary`: charcoal on light, cream on dark).
- Amber (`p.accent`) only means "on": running item, active wait, enabled
  switch, focused field.
- No gradients, glows or decorative tints; depth from borders and surface
  steps. Lucide icons at 1.75 stroke.
- GPUI panics if `.hover()` is set twice on one element; helpers like
  `ui::button` already set it.

## Vendored GPUI patch

`vendor/gpui-pre-windows` is `gpui-pre-windows` 0.3.7 with marked
`ROSHAN PATCH` changes: right-to-left glyph placement in DirectWrite, and no
maximize (no `WS_MAXIMIZEBOX`, caption double-click and `SC_MAXIMIZE`
swallowed). Keep patches minimal and documented in `ROSHAN_PATCH.md`.

## Releases

Manual only: Actions → **Release** → enter a version. It bumps
`Cargo.toml`, tags, builds Windows (installer only)/macOS/Linux and creates a
**draft** release for review. The updater depends on the file names
`Roshan-Setup-<version>.exe` and `SHA256SUMS.txt`; keep them in sync.
