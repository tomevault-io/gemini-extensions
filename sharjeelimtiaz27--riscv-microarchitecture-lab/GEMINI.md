## Project Vision

Design a complete, production-quality 64-bit RISC-V processor from architectural specification to physical chip implementation.

The processor will be:
- RV64IM to start, with a roadmap to RV64GC (IMAFDC)
- Out-of-order execution, 5-stage pipeline
- All privilege levels (M/S/U) per the RISC-V specification
- Capable of booting a small Linux kernel
- Open for community extension: UART, AI accelerators, crypto cores, etc.
- Available in two variants: standard and logic-locked (secure)

This is also a structured learning project. The goal is for Sharjeel to reach the point where he can independently start any verification task (pyuvm/cocotb testbench, SVA properties, RTL module) without AI assistance, then use Claude to go faster and deeper.

## Weekly Documentation Workflow

At the end of every work week, Claude Code generates two files for that week:

**Three files are generated per week:**

**1. `weekNN.md`** — `docs/weekly_notebooks/weekNN.md`
- Theory, concepts, architecture explanations, lessons learned, interview Q&A
- No command dumps — just learning content
- Public on GitHub, useful for other engineers and students

**2. `weekNN_commands.md`** — `docs/weekly_notebooks/weekNN_commands.md`
- Commands only, organized by task
- Every command has a one-line comment explaining what it does and why
- Meant to be a fast copy-paste reference during future sessions
- No theory, no prose — purely operational

**3. `weekNN_research_notebook.docx`** — `docs/weekly_notebooks/weekNN_research_notebook.docx`
- Everything woven together as one flowing readable document
- Commands appear inline where they are needed, not in a separate section
- Rich formatting: color tables, dark code blocks, Q&A boxes, page numbers
- Best for studying and interview prep

**How to trigger this in Claude Code:**

At the end of a session, say:
> "Generate the Week NN docs"

Claude Code generates all three files and places them in `docs/weekly_notebooks/`.

**What goes in each file:**

| Content | weekNN.md | weekNN_commands.md | .docx |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|-------|
| Objectives | Yes | No | Yes |
| Theory and explanations | Yes | No | Yes |
| Commands with context | No | Yes | Yes, inline |
| Progress tracker | Yes | No | Yes |
| Lessons learned | Yes | No | Yes |
| Interview Q&A | Yes | No | Yes |
| Next week plan | Yes | No | Yes |

**Naming convention:**
```
docs/weekly_notebooks/week01.md
docs/weekly_notebooks/week01_commands.md
docs/weekly_notebooks/week01_research_notebook.docx
```

## Current State (as of Week 02)

**Completed:**
- Single-cycle RV32I RTL: pc, regfile, alu, alu_ctrl, immgen, inst_memory, data_memory, single_cycle_top
- Smoke testbench: `single_cycle_smoke_tb.sv`
- Smoke test passed: x1=5, x2=7, x3=12 — SMOKE PASS
- pyuvm skeleton: driver, monitor, scoreboard, sequencer, env, sequence, test
- SVA basics file: `basic_props.sv` — x0_immutable, opcode_nonzero_after_fetch
- VCD generated and verified in QuestaSim

**Known open issue:**
- Xcelium smoke testbench did NOT generate VCD. QuestaSim worked. Must investigate next session.
  - Likely cause: `$dumpfile`/`$dumpvars` in TB not being reached, or xrun flags missing `-access +rwc`
  - First step: check `artifacts/xrun_run.log` for TB output and VCD-related messages

**Immediate next tasks (in order):**
1. Fix VCD generation under Xcelium — verify `$dumpfile`/`$dumpvars` are hit
2. Run the pyuvm smoke test end-to-end with Xcelium, confirm PASS + coverage report
3. Add functional coverage groups to monitor (register write events, opcode coverage)
4. Extend SVA properties: pc_aligned, writeback_correctness, mem_bounds
5. Bind `basic_props_checker` into the top-level for simulation-time assertion checking
6. Set up JasperGold TCL script to prove x0_immutable formally on RTL
7. Run Genus synthesis — generate netlist + SDF file
8. Run Conformal equivalence check — prove RTL == netlist
9. Run GLS — simulate netlist with SDF back-annotation, re-bind assertions
10. Run JasperGold on gate-level netlist — prove properties hold on synthesized logic
11. Run Innovus on synthesized netlist — generate basic P&R result

## Gate Level Simulation and Post-Synthesis Verification

This section explains the full post-synthesis verification flow. Understanding this is what separates a block-level verification engineer from a security-grade SoC verification engineer.

### What GLS is and why it matters

After Genus synthesis, your RTL has been converted into actual standard cells — AND gates, flip-flops, MUX cells from a technology library. Gate Level Simulation means running your existing testbench against this netlist instead of the RTL, with real gate propagation delays back-annotated from a Standard Delay Format (SDF) file that Genus generates.

For security hardware specifically, GLS catches two classes of problems that RTL simulation cannot:

Timing violations that open side-channel windows. A security property proven at RTL level may be violated at gate level because a signal arrives one gate-delay late, briefly exposing a secret value on a bus before the correct masking logic fires. This is not a functional bug — the final stable value is correct — but the glitch is observable through power or timing side channels.

Synthesis optimizations that restructure security logic. Genus legally optimizes logic for area and timing. In a crypto core or a logic-locked design, a seemingly equivalent restructuring can change the observable switching behavior, weakening a side-channel countermeasure or subtly altering the locking behavior.

### Assertions at gate level

Genus strips all SVA assertions from the netlist — they are not synthesizable constructs. To check properties at gate level you have three complementary approaches:

**Conformal equivalence checking** is the most important first step. It proves that the synthesized netlist is logically equivalent to the RTL for all inputs. If Conformal passes, your RTL-proven formal properties hold at gate level by transitivity. This is the standard industrial practice.

**GLS with re-bound checker** means writing a thin gate-level simulation wrapper that instantiates the synthesized netlist and re-instantiates your `basic_props_checker` module alongside it, connecting to the same signals. The assertions then fire during GLS and catch any timing-induced violations.

**JasperGold on the netlist** runs formal proof directly on the synthesized netlist. This is slower than RTL formal but proves properties hold on the actual logic cells. Useful for security properties where you cannot trust equivalence checking alone.

### GLS commands (when netlist is ready)

```bash
# Step 1: Genus produces the netlist and SDF
genus -f syn/single_cycle_syn.tcl
# outputs: syn/results/single_cycle_mapped.v
#          syn/results/single_cycle.sdf

# Step 2: Run Conformal equivalence check
lec -xl -nogui -dofile formal/conformal_check.do
# golden = RTL, revised = synthesized netlist

# Step 3: GLS with SDF back-annotation
xrun -sv syn/results/single_cycle_mapped.v \
     rtl/assertions/basic_props.sv \
     tb/gls_smoke_tb.sv \
     -sdf_file syn/results/single_cycle.sdf \
     -R -access +rwc \
     -l artifacts/xrun_gls.log

# Check for timing violations and assertion failures
grep -i "sdf\|timing\|SVA FAIL\|violation" artifacts/xrun_gls.log
```

### Conformal TCL template

```tcl
# formal/conformal_check.do
read design -golden  -sv rtl/common/*.sv rtl/single_cycle/single_cycle_top.sv
read design -revised -sv syn/results/single_cycle_mapped.v
map key points
verify
report verification
```

**Cadence environment setup on HPC:**
```bash
cad
1.3                  # loads Cadence 2025 EDA
which xrun           # should return /eda/cadence/.../xrun
xrun -version        # should show 24.03-s004
```

## Coding Standards and Conventions

### General Rules (always follow)
- No emojis anywhere in code, comments, or documentation
- File headers use the standard project banner (see any existing .sv file)
- All RTL is SystemVerilog 2012 (`-sv` flag, `always_comb`, `always_ff`, `logic` type)
- Use `logic` not `wire` or `reg` in SystemVerilog
- Module names match file names exactly
- Python files use snake_case; SV files use snake_case

### SystemVerilog RTL Conventions
- Use `always_comb` for combinational logic (never `always @(*)`)
- Use `always_ff @(posedge clk or negedge rst_n)` for sequential
- Active-low reset signal is named `rst_n`
- Default case in all `unique case` statements
- No latches — every `always_comb` must have full assignment coverage
- `ibex_csr` quirk: use logical operators (`&&`, `||`) not bitwise (`&`, `|`) in conditions

### Assertion Style
- All assertions in separate checker modules, not inline in RTL
- Module naming: `<block>_props_checker`
- Always include `disable iff (!rst_n)` in concurrent assertions
- Comment each property with plain-English intent above it

### Python / pyuvm Conventions
- Class names: PascalCase (e.g., `SingleCycleDriver`)
- Component constructors always accept `(name, parent)` or `(name, parent, dut)`
- No bare `print()` for pass/fail — use `cocotb.log.info()` or `cocotb.log.error()`
- All cocotb tests use `@cocotb.test()` decorator
- Async functions use `await` properly — never mix sync/async without care

### Commit Messages
- Format: `<scope>: <short description>`
- Examples: `rtl: add branch logic to single_cycle_top`, `uvm: extend scoreboard for coverage`, `formal: add pc_aligned property`
- No emojis in commit messages
