# AGENTS.md

This is a native macOS menu bar app named Beacon. It re-broadcasts Bonjour/mDNS
services that are visible to the Mac but not visible to the rest of the LAN,
with Docker and OrbStack container services as the motivating case. The common
example is Home Assistant or a HomeKit bridge running in a container: the Mac can
resolve the service, but other devices cannot discover it until Beacon advertises
it through the host mDNSResponder.

Beacon is intentionally small and native:

- SwiftUI app, macOS 14 minimum.
- Pure Swift wrappers around the system `dns_sd` API from mDNSResponder.
- No Python, no `dns-sd` subprocesses.
- Xcode project generated from `project.yml` by XcodeGen.
- Settings and whitelist are persisted as JSON in
  `~/Library/Application Support/Beacon/`.

## Repository Map

- `Beacon/BeaconApp.swift`: app entry point, menu bar extra, main window scene,
  and shared observable object setup.
- `Beacon/Engine/`: DNS-SD wrappers and runtime broadcasting orchestration.
- `Beacon/Model/`: persisted settings, whitelist entries, service type catalog,
  and JSON store.
- `Beacon/UI/`: SwiftUI screens for Status, Discovery, Whitelist, Settings, and
  About.
- `Beacon/Assets.xcassets/`: app icons and template menu bar icons.
- `Beacon/Info.plist`: local network usage text and Bonjour service type list.
- `Beacon/Beacon.entitlements`: network client/server entitlements.
- `SelfTest/`: command line harness for browsing, resolving, registering, and
  mirroring services through the same engine components.
- `project.yml`: source of truth for the Xcode project.
- `scripts/release.sh`: Developer ID release build, DMG packaging, optional
  notarization and stapling.
- `.env.example`: template for local signing/notarization variables.

Generated or local files may exist in a checkout but should not be treated as
source of truth: `Beacon.xcodeproj/`, `build/`, `dist/`, `.env`, `.DS_Store`,
`xcuserdata/`, and local tool settings such as `.claude/settings.local.json`.

## How Beacon Works

The core flow is:

1. Discover service instances with `DNSServiceBrowse`.
2. Resolve a selected or whitelisted instance with `DNSServiceResolve`.
3. Re-register that service with `DNSServiceRegister`.
4. Keep the DNS service ref alive while broadcasting.
5. Deallocate the ref to withdraw the advertisement.

The important behavior is in `Beacon/Engine/ServiceRegistrar.swift`: registration
passes `host = nil` to `DNSServiceRegister`. That makes the SRV target point at
the local Mac, matching `dns-sd -R` behavior. Do not "fix" this by passing the
resolved container host. Beacon deliberately preserves the original port and TXT
record while advertising from the host.

Port values from `DNSServiceResolve` are in network byte order. `ResolvedService`
stores the raw network-order port for registration and exposes `displayPort` for
UI. Keep that distinction intact.

TXT records are round-tripped as raw bytes for mirrored services. The `TXT`
helpers in `DNSSD.swift` are for display and for fresh self-test registrations.
Avoid replacing the raw mirrored TXT data with parsed/re-encoded data unless that
is the explicit feature being built.

## Runtime Architecture

`Store` is the persisted source of truth. It is `@Observable` and `@MainActor`,
and owns:

- `AppSettings`, saved to `settings.json`.
- `[WhitelistEntry]`, saved to `whitelist.json`.

`BroadcastEngine` is the transient runtime coordinator. It is also
`@Observable` and `@MainActor`, and owns:

- per-entry run states keyed by `WhitelistEntry.ID`;
- active `ServiceRegistrar` instances;
- desired-running IDs;
- advertised names, used to flag Beacon's own re-broadcasts in Discovery;
- auto-refresh timer;
- `NWPathMonitor` refresh on network reconnection.

The engine resolves each entry by trying the entry's `preferredServiceType`
first, then the selected service types from settings. On a successful resolve it
records the last host, port, service type, and date back into the store.

`ServiceBrowser`, `ServiceResolver`, and `ServiceRegistrar` each own DNS-SD refs
and dispatch queues. Be careful with lifetime management: callbacks use retained
contexts, refs are deallocated on the queue used by callbacks, and continuations
must resume exactly once.

## UI Architecture

Beacon is menu-bar-first:

- `MenuBarExtra` hosts `StatusPanel`, the primary status and start/stop surface.
- The `Window("Beacon", id: WindowID.main)` hosts the configuration UI.
- `MainWindow` uses `NavigationSplitView` over `MainTab`.
- `AppRouter` lets the menu bar panel deep-link to Discovery, Whitelist,
  Settings, or About in the main window.

Screen responsibilities:

- `DiscoveryView`: live browsing over `store.settings.discoveryServiceTypes`,
  resolving the selected row, and adding services to the whitelist.
- `WhitelistView`: manual add, enable/pause, reorder, delete, and per-entry
  run/stop.
- `SettingsView`: service groups, custom service types, launch at login,
  start delay, auto-refresh, verbose setting, legacy whitelist import, and the
  hidden icon setting after unlock.
- `StatusPanel`: compact menu bar dropdown for enabled services, run state, and
  Start All/Stop All.
- `AboutView`: version display, links, app icon preview, and hidden icon unlock.

UI should read and mutate shared state through `Store`, `BroadcastEngine`, and
`AppRouter` environment values. Avoid parallel view-owned source-of-truth state
for persisted or broadcast state.

## Service Types and Local Network Permissions

`ServiceTypeCatalog.swift` defines service groups and friendly labels. Settings
select groups plus custom literal service types. Discovery excludes
`_services._dns-sd._udp` because it is a meta enumeration query, not a browsable
instance type.

`Info.plist` contains `NSBonjourServices` and
`NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription`. If you add service types to the catalog that
should work under macOS Local Network privacy, update the plist too.

## Icons and Assets

Icon lookup strings are centralized in `CrispyIcon.swift`:

- `AppIcon`
- `AppIconCrispy`
- `MenuBarIcon`
- `MenuBarIconCrispy`

Menu bar images are composed by `StatusBarIconManager` into state-specific
`NSImage`s. The source glyph is drawn in menu-bar white, while inactive dimming
and the green/red status dot are baked into the image because `MenuBarExtra`
does not reliably preserve arbitrary SwiftUI overlays in the status item.
Missing assets fall back to an SF Symbol, so the app should continue to build
while art is in progress.

There is a hidden "crispy" icon variant unlocked from `AboutView` by tapping the
version text five times. Its state lives in `UserDefaults` through `@AppStorage`
keys in `CrispyDefaults`.

## Build and Test Commands

Generate the project before opening or building:

```bash
xcodegen generate
```

Build the app:

```bash
xcodebuild -project Beacon.xcodeproj -scheme Beacon -configuration Debug build
```

Build the self-test tool:

```bash
xcodebuild -project Beacon.xcodeproj -scheme beacon-selftest -configuration Debug build
```

Useful self-test invocations once the tool is built and on your PATH:

```bash
beacon-selftest browse _hap._tcp
beacon-selftest resolve "My Service" _hap._tcp
beacon-selftest register "Test Service" _http._tcp 8080
beacon-selftest mirror "My Service" _hap._tcp
```

There is no dedicated automated test suite in the repo today. For engine work,
use the self-test CLI and compare against the system `dns-sd` tool where useful.
For UI work, build the app and manually exercise the affected screen.

## Diagnostics

Beacon uses macOS Unified Logging with subsystem `com.lplaboratories.beacon`.
Users can inspect logs in Console.app or with:

```bash
log stream --predicate 'subsystem == "com.lplaboratories.beacon"'
```

Normal logging should stay concise: startup, persistence failures, DNS-SD
failures, and important state changes. The persisted `verboseLogging` setting
enables detailed discovery, resolve, registration, auto-refresh and network path
logs. Do not log raw TXT values; log counts or keys only.

## Release Flow

Release signing reads local variables from `.env`, which is ignored. Start from
`.env.example` and never commit real signing credentials.
Notarization credentials should live in a `notarytool` Keychain profile, not in
`.env`; let `notarytool store-credentials` prompt for app-specific passwords.

Release command:

```bash
scripts/release.sh 1.0.0
```

The script regenerates the Xcode project, builds Release with Developer ID and
hardened runtime, verifies the signature, creates a DMG under `dist/`, and
notarizes/staples when the configured notary profile exists.

## Development Guidelines

- Keep `project.yml` as the project source of truth. Regenerate
  `Beacon.xcodeproj/`; do not hand-edit or commit generated project files.
- Keep persisted schema changes backward-compatible where practical. Existing
  users may already have `settings.json` and `whitelist.json`.
- Keep DNS-SD lifetimes explicit. Do not allow refs or retained contexts to leak,
  and do not deallocate refs from a queue that can race active callbacks.
- Preserve the host-nil registration behavior unless the product requirement
  explicitly changes. It is the core workaround.
- Preserve the network-byte-order port path from resolve to register.
- Stop active broadcasts when deleting or disabling whitelist entries.
- Do not whitelist Beacon's own re-broadcasts from Discovery.
- Avoid adding subprocess dependencies for DNS-SD. This project is deliberately
  built on the native API.
- Do not read, print, or commit `.env`; it may contain Apple ID and signing
  details.
- Prefer small, focused SwiftUI changes that respect the existing menu-bar-first
  structure and shared observable state.
