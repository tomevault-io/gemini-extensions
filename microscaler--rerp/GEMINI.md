This document provides agentic AI systems with essential context and references for working on the RERP project.

## Project Overview

**RERP** (Rust Enterprise Resource Planning) is a cloud-native, microservices-based ERP system built with Rust. The project consists of **71 independent microservices**, each with its own OpenAPI specification, organized into a Rust workspace with 142 crates (71 generated + 71 implementation).

---

## Suites and BFF (Important)

**RERP is composed of suites of systems.** Each **suite** has:

- **Microservices**: `openapi/{suite}/{name}/openapi.yaml` and corresponding `microservices/` crates
- **One BFF per suite**: `openapi/{suite}/bff-suite-config.yaml` and generated `openapi/{suite}/openapi_bff.yaml` that aggregates that suite’s services

Example: the **accounting** suite has microservices (general-ledger, invoice, accounts-receivable, accounts-payable, bank-sync, asset, budget, edi, financial-reports) and one **BFF** that fronts them. Other suites (e.g. HR, sales) will have their own BFF when implemented.

Suites are inferred **dynamically**: `rerp` and related tooling list `openapi/` subdirs that contain `bff-suite-config.yaml`, read `bff_service_name` from each config, and walk `openapi/{suite}/{name}/openapi.yaml` for microservices. **No hardcoded suite names or BFF mappings** in `rerp ports`. When adding a new suite with a BFF, add `openapi/{suite}/bff-suite-config.yaml` with `bff_service_name` and tooling will pick it up.

---

## Key Architecture Principles

1. **OpenAPI-First**: All services are defined in OpenAPI 3.1.0 specifications
2. **Code Generation**: Services are generated from OpenAPI specs using BRRTRouter
3. **Two-Crate Model**: Each service has a generated crate and an implementation crate
4. **Microservices**: Independent, deployable services with well-defined APIs
5. **Suite-Level BFF**: Each suite has one BFF; `openapi/{suite}/bff-suite-config.yaml` and `openapi_bff.yaml` are per-suite

---

## Agentic AI Planning & Analysis Documents

**⚠️ CRITICAL RULE: ALL planning, analysis, design proposals, and implementation status documents MUST be created in `./docs/` or its subdirectories. Creating planning documents in the project root or other locations is NOT ALLOWED.**

### LLM Wiki

RERP has a persistent LLM wiki at [`docs/llmwiki/`](docs/llmwiki/). For substantive tooling, architecture, generator, or operational changes:

1. Read [`docs/llmwiki/SCHEMA.md`](docs/llmwiki/SCHEMA.md) and [`docs/llmwiki/index.md`](docs/llmwiki/index.md).
2. Update or create the relevant topic/entity page under `docs/llmwiki/`.
3. Update `docs/llmwiki/index.md` when adding pages.
4. Append an entry to `docs/llmwiki/log.md`.

The wiki is not a replacement for source code or ADRs. It is the reconciled, agent-facing synthesis that prevents future sessions from rediscovering and undoing known fixes.

### Document Organization

Planning documents are organized in `docs/` as follows:

- **`docs/ai/`** - AI-generated planning, analysis, and implementation status documents
- **`docs/adrs/`** - Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- **`docs/`** (root) - Design proposals, PRDs, and other planning documents

### Implementation Status (docs/ai/)

- **[docs/ai/OPENAPI_GENERATION_COMPLETE.md](docs/ai/OPENAPI_GENERATION_COMPLETE.md)** - OpenAPI specification generation status for all 71 services
- **[docs/ai/BFF_GENERATION_COMPLETE.md](docs/ai/BFF_GENERATION_COMPLETE.md)** - System-level BFF generation completion status
- **[docs/ai/FIRST_CI_AUTOMATION.md](docs/ai/FIRST_CI_AUTOMATION.md)** - First CI automation implementation and status

### Architecture & Planning (docs/ai/)

- **[docs/ai/SYSTEM_BFF_GENERATION.md](docs/ai/SYSTEM_BFF_GENERATION.md)** - System-level BFF generation architecture and process
- **[docs/ai/TOP_LEVEL_SPECS_PLAN.md](docs/ai/TOP_LEVEL_SPECS_PLAN.md)** - Planning document for top-level OpenAPI specifications
- **[docs/ai/CI_AUTOMATION_SETUP.md](docs/ai/CI_AUTOMATION_SETUP.md)** - CI/CD automation setup and configuration

### Analysis & Research (docs/ai/)

- **[docs/ai/ODOO_MODULES_ANALYSIS.md](docs/ai/ODOO_MODULES_ANALYSIS.md)** - Comprehensive analysis of Odoo modules and architecture patterns
- **[docs/ai/MICROSERVICE_MATRIX_AUDIT.md](docs/ai/MICROSERVICE_MATRIX_AUDIT.md)** - Microservice matrix audit and service organization analysis

### Design Proposals & PRDs (docs/)

Design proposals, Product Requirements Documents (PRDs), and similar planning documents should be placed in `docs/` (root of docs directory) or appropriate subdirectories:

- Design proposals: `docs/DESIGN_PROPOSAL_*.md`
- PRDs: `docs/*_PRD.md`
- Analysis documents: `docs/*_ANALYSIS.md`
- Status documents: `docs/*_STATUS.md` or `docs/*_COMPLETE.md`

**Examples:**
- ✅ `docs/DESIGN_PROPOSAL_RELEASE_CI_INTEGRATION.md`
- ✅ `docs/VERSIONING_STRATEGY_ANALYSIS.md`
- ✅ `docs/ACCOUNTING_SUITE_ENRICHMENT_PRD.md`
- ❌ `DESIGN_PROPOSAL_*.md` (project root - NOT ALLOWED)
- ❌ `VERSIONING_STRATEGY_*.md` (project root - NOT ALLOWED)

## Development Workflow for Agents

### 1. Understanding the Project

1. Read [README.md](README.md) for project overview
2. Review [RERP_MUSINGS.md](RERP_MUSINGS.md) for module breakdown and market analysis
3. Check microservices structure: `microservices/{suite}/{service}/gen/` (generated) and `microservices/{suite}/{service}/impl/` (business logic)
4. Review relevant AI planning documents in `docs/ai/`

### 2. Working with Services

Each service follows this structure:
- **Generated crate**: `microservices/{suite}/{service}/gen/` - Auto-generated from OpenAPI
- **Implementation crate**: `microservices/{suite}/{service}/impl/` - Business logic
- **OpenAPI spec**: `openapi/{suite}/{service}/openapi.yaml`

### 3. Code Generation

```bash
# Generate code from OpenAPI spec
cd microservices/{suite}/{service}/impl
brrtrouter-gen --spec ../../../openapi/{suite}/{service}/openapi.yaml --output ../gen
```

### 4. Suite BFF Generation

Each suite has its own BFF. For the **accounting** suite:

```bash
bff-generator generate-spec --config openapi/accounting/bff-suite-config.yaml --output openapi/accounting/openapi_bff.yaml
```

For other suites, use `openapi/{suite}/bff-suite-config.yaml` and `openapi/{suite}/openapi_bff.yaml`. The `rerp bff generate-system` command and CI workflows may generate one or more suite BFFs.

---

## Important File Locations

### Core Project Files

- `microservices/Cargo.toml` - Workspace root configuration
- Shared utilities are in `entities/` crate
- `openapi/` - All OpenAPI specifications
- `port-registry.json` - Port registry at **project root**; `rerp ports` uses it. All automation is in `rerp` (tooling/).

### Documentation

- `README.md` - User-facing project overview
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Developer contribution guidelines
- `RERP_MUSINGS.md` - Module breakdown and market analysis
- `docs/EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md` - Executive overview
- `docs/adrs/` - Architecture Decision Records

### CI/CD

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Validate OpenAPI (incl. BFF generation dry run), build, test, multi-arch

---

## Service Organization

RERP services are organized into **6 implementation phases**:

1. **Phase 1: Core Foundation** (7 services) - Auth, infrastructure, product
2. **Phase 2: Business Operations** (14 services) - CRM, sales, purchase, inventory
3. **Phase 3: Financial & HR** (16 services) - Accounting, HR
4. **Phase 4: Advanced Operations** (7 services) - Manufacturing, project
5. **Phase 5: Customer-Facing** (10 services) - Marketing, website, POS, helpdesk
6. **Phase 6: Extensions** (5 services) - Marketplace, analytics

Plus **12 additional services** for AI, automation, data, documents, ESG, IoT, and localization.

---

## Automation and Scripting

**All scripting and automation must be implemented in `tooling/`** (the `rerp` CLI). Do not create scripts in other directories. See `tooling/README.md` for the `rerp` surface.

### OpenAPI / BFF

- `rerp bff generate-system` — Generates system-level BFF specs (run via `tooling/.venv/bin/rerp` after `just init`). For suite BFF: `bff-generator generate-spec --config openapi/{suite}/bff-suite-config.yaml --output openapi/{suite}/openapi_bff.yaml`. Use existing `openapi/*` specs and `brrtrouter-gen` for new stubs.

### Setup

- Use `rerp` and its deps via `just init` (tooling/.venv).

---

## Current Project Status

- ✅ **71 Services Defined**: Complete OpenAPI specifications
- ✅ **Crate Structure**: 142 crates organized in workspace
- ✅ **BFF Generation**: Auto-generated BFF per suite (accounting has `openapi_bff.yaml`)
- ✅ **CI Automation**: GitHub Actions for BFF generation

- ⏳ **Implementation**: Business logic implementation in progress

---

## Best Practices for Agents

1. **Always check AI docs first**: Review relevant documents in `docs/ai/` and `docs/` before making changes
2. **Planning documents in docs/ only**: **ALL planning, analysis, design proposals, and status documents MUST be created in `./docs/` or subdirectories. NEVER create planning documents in the project root or other locations.**
3. **Follow the two-crate model**: Don't modify generated crates directly
4. **Update OpenAPI specs**: Changes to APIs should be in OpenAPI specs first
5. **Regenerate BFF specs**: After updating service specs in a suite, regenerate that suite’s BFF (`openapi/{suite}/openapi_bff.yaml` from `bff-suite-config.yaml`)
6. **Test changes**: Ensure all tests pass before committing
7. **Update documentation**: Keep AI planning docs updated with status changes
8. **Scripting in tooling only**: **Any scripting or automation requirements must be implemented in `tooling/`** (the `rerp` CLI). Do not add ad-hoc scripts, shell scripts, or one-off Python files elsewhere in the repo. For new automation, add a `rerp` subcommand or module in `tooling/` and **update all usages in the same commit**: CI, justfile, Tiltfile, docs. See `tooling/README.md`.
9. **Staging: only track what belongs in git** — Before `git add` or `farm git commit`, **check every staged file**: must **not** be in [`.gitignore`](.gitignore) or be generated/temporary (e.g. `tooling/.coverage`, `tooling/.venv/`, `**/target/`, `*.pyc`, `__pycache__/`, `node_modules/`, `.env` with secrets). If a file should be ignored, add it to `.gitignore` and `git rm --cached <path>` to stop tracking; do not stage it. This avoids committing build artifacts, coverage, and local config.

## Lifeguard Entities and Indices (entities/)

RERP uses **Lifeguard** (`lifeguard_derive::LifeModel`) for ORM entities in `entities/`. Migration SQL is generated from these structs. Follow these rules to avoid broken migrations:

### Index and column rules

- **`#[index = "idx_name(column)"]` and `#[indexed]` must reference only columns that exist on that struct.**  
  The derive and migration generator do not validate that index columns exist. Indices on non-existent columns produce `CREATE INDEX` on a missing column and **migration application fails** (e.g. PostgreSQL: "column does not exist").

- **Child/specialized entities that link to a base entity via a foreign key do not inherit the base entity’s columns.**  
  Example: `CustomerInvoice` and `VendorInvoice` link to the base `invoices` table via `invoice_id`. They do **not** have `invoice_number`, `due_date`, `status`, or `payment_state`; those exist only on `invoices`.  
  - ✅ Index on `customer_id` on `CustomerInvoice` (column exists on the struct).  
  - ❌ Index on `invoice_number` on `CustomerInvoice` (column exists only on `invoices`).

- **To query by base-entity fields on a child table, use a JOIN.**  
  Index the child’s own columns (e.g. `customer_id`, `vendor_id`, `invoice_id` if you need faster lookups from child to parent). Put indices for `invoice_number`, `due_date`, `status`, etc. on the base `Invoice` entity only.

### Checklist when adding or changing entities

1. List the struct’s fields. Every `#[index = "idx_name(x)"]` and `#[indexed]` must use one of those names.
2. If the struct is a child of another (e.g. `invoice_id` → `invoices`), do not copy indices from the parent; only index columns that exist on the child.
3. After changing indices, run migration generation (e.g. from the `entities/` directory: `cargo run --bin generate-migrations`) and apply migrations in a test DB to confirm they apply cleanly.
