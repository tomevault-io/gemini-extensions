# Rekal CLI

## Soul

Before making any design decision, read `SOUL.md`. It defines the two problems Rekal exists to solve and the seven beliefs that guide every choice. If a decision conflicts with the soul, the decision is wrong.

When working on a problem, consult Rekal's own memories first:

```bash
rekal "<describe the problem>"
```

The prior context for what you're working on may already exist.

## Standing Rules

- Keep this file up to date. Any change to commands, packages, files, or behavior must be reflected here. Update `--help` text when command behavior changes. Update `docs/spec/command/` when a command spec changes. Stale docs are worse than no docs.
- Consult `SOUL.md` before design decisions. Consult `rekal` before starting work on a problem.

## Architecture

Single binary. Everything embedded — CLI, database engine, embedding model, compression dictionary.

- CLI: Cobra (`github.com/spf13/cobra`)
- Storage: DuckDB via `github.com/marcboeker/go-duckdb` (`database/sql` interface)
- Compression: zstd via `github.com/klauspost/compress` with preset dictionary
- IDs: ULID via `github.com/oklog/ulid/v2`
- Embeddings: LSA (gonum) + Nomic (platform-specific builds)
- Build: mise, go modules
- Lint: golangci-lint v2 (2.8.0)
- Language: Go 1.25.6

Two databases in `.rekal/`:
- `data.db` — immutable source of truth. Append-only. Pushed to git.
- `index.db` — local derived index. Rebuilt from data.db. Never pushed.

This split is a direct consequence of the soul: thin on the wire, rich on the machine.

The `.rekal/` store lives in the repository's **main worktree**; every linked
git worktree resolves to that one shared store via `gitx.MainWorktreeRoot`
(a no-op for non-worktree repos, so existing installs need no migration). All
store-path helpers (`db.StoreDir`, `cli.RekalDir`, and the `Open*`/`*Path`
functions) funnel through it; git-state helpers (`HeadSHA`/`CurrentBranch`) and
session discovery keep using the invoking worktree. The no-op is enforced by
identity, not by string: git reports worktree paths with symlinks resolved, so
a repo reached through a symlinked directory (macOS `/var` → `/private/var`,
or any symlinked project dir) would otherwise come back under a different name
for the same place and move `.rekal/` off the store that already exists —
`preferCallerPath` stats both and hands the caller's own spelling back.

## Key Directories

### Commands (`cmd/rekal/`)

- `main.go`: Entry point

### Core CLI (`cmd/rekal/cli/`)

- `root.go`: Root command (recall is the default) + command registration.
  A query whose first word matches a registered command name (`log`, `push`,
  `sync`, …) is ordinary cobra dispatch, not search — `rekal -- <query>`
  forces root-level recall past the collision (`--` stops cobra resolving
  the next word as a subcommand), documented in `--help` and the `Example`
  block rather than left for the user to discover. Zero-arg subcommands
  (`log`, `version`, `sync`, `push`, `embed`, `index`, `checkpoint`, `clean`,
  `init`) carry `Args: rejectExtraArgs` (preconditions.go) so a query that
  silently collided with one of them — `rekal log recent commits about the
  ledger` used to dump the plain `log` output at exit 0, discarding
  everything after the matched word — now errors and names the `--` escape
  hatch instead of answering a different question with no sign anything was
  wrong. `-A/--actor` is validated (`validateActorFilter`): an unrecognized
  value used to silently match zero sessions, indistinguishable from a
  query that legitimately has no hits for a real `human`/`agent` value.
  `-e/--explain` without `-j/--json` now warns to stderr — the enrichment
  only ever reached the JSON payload, so passing `-e` alone silently
  computed and discarded it.
- `recall.go`: Recall command orchestration — open/migrate/auto-rebuild the
  index DB, refresh the knowledge layer (watermark-gated), call the `search`
  package. Two self-healing paths, both best-effort: an **empty** index is
  rebuilt inline (`IsIndexPopulated`), and an index whose vectors are **behind
  this binary** spawns the same background `rekal embed` that index/sync use,
  rather than only printing a warning — otherwise an upgrade leaves the semantic
  layer dark on every repo the user owns until they happen to read a warning.
  Staleness is a comparison, not a list: `index_state.embed_backend` records
  which backend produced the vectors (written beside `embed_model` by
  `recordEmbedProvenance`), and `staleEmbeddedVectors` treats an
  **embedded**-backend index whose model id is not `nomic.ModelName` as an
  upgrade to finish. So a future id bump needs no registration — the previous
  hand-maintained set could be forgotten, and forgetting it told the user their
  embedding config was missing. `legacyEmbeddedModels` is a **closed** set for
  stores predating that column; do not add to it. An **http**-backend mismatch
  is deliberately *not* stale: it means the embedding config was removed, and
  re-embedding locally would silently replace the store's vectors with a
  different model's. `rekal embed` holds its own lock, so concurrent recalls
  converge on one worker. Skipped under `session.BenchEnv`. First runs `maybeRefreshStaleSkill` (init.go): the agent enters here
  after loading the skill, so a skill left behind by a binary upgrade
  (version-pinned marker mismatch) is refreshed in place — best-effort, bench-
  gated, touches only the gitignored `.claude/skills/`.
  **Default output is the seed digest** (`digest.go`); `--json` gives
  raw structured results. The ranking engine itself lives in `search/`.
  Auto-widening recall: `deriveFramings` derives a bounded set (≤`maxFramings`)
  of deterministic reformulations of the query (keyword-only, clause splits,
  temporal variant — general linguistics, no corpus tuning) and RRF-fuses their
  result lists (`fuseFramings`, k=60, conf=max-per-session) into one seed. The
  original query is always framing v0, so fusion only adds/reorders hits; a
  query that yields no reformulation runs as a single search (byte-identical).
  Also the L1 recall-graph seam (`docs/design/recall-graph.md`): reads each
  seed's reach hint from `session_reach` (`attachReach`) **before** spooling
  this call's own surfaced edges (`logRecallEdges` → `graph.Append`), so a
  session never inflates its own count.
- `digest.go`: in-binary port of the old route.py — turns a `search.Output` into
  the seed digest (INJECT/KNOWLEDGE/SILENCE + per-seed `conf=`), byte-identical
  (golden-tested). Super-low env-overridable floor (`REKAL_HUNT_*`),
  recommendation not decision; SILENCE exits 1. Per-seed `reachHint` suffix
  (`[reached N×· "query"]`) is empty for unreached seeds, so cold-store output
  stays byte-identical. `withEvidence` drops seeds carrying **zero confidence
  and zero mass together** before the window is spent — ranking is
  max-normalized, so on a weak candidate set something always floats up with no
  absolute evidence behind it (harness echoes like "Reply with exactly: OK").
  Exact zero on the engine's own absolute measures, corpus-invariant by
  construction — not a confidence floor, which the soul forbids. The verdict is
  still computed on the full set, and `--json` stays raw.
- `view.go`: in-binary port of the old view.py — `viewSession` (drill →
  readable turns, plus a `commits:` block naming the commits the conversation
  produced — the reverse of recall's `--commit`, so the drill points back at
  the diff instead of dead-ending at the reasoning; additive and emitted only
  when the session has commits, which is why the golden view is unchanged) and `viewRows` (SQL → TSV). The default query output;
  `--json` gives raw. Session view is golden-tested byte-identical
- `find.go`: `rekal find "<term>" [role]` — complete, time-ordered enumeration
  sweep over the **index** (`turns_ft`), falling back to `data.db.turns` only
  when there is no index to read. The index is the whole ledger: local capture
  plus every synced teammate session (which never touches data.db) minus the
  duplicate captures supersession collapsed — sweeping data.db answered "every
  mention" with one member's share of the corpus (measured: 10 of 30 on a
  two-person store), and a complete-set command that silently returns a subset
  is worse than none. `docs/spec/command/find.md` always specified the index;
  the code had drifted. `turns.ts` is a TIMESTAMP and `turns_ft.ts` a VARCHAR,
  so the sweep casts and normalizes (`findTimestamp`) rather than scanning a
  type that depends on which table it landed on
- `knowledge_index.go`: Knowledge-layer build/refresh — chunk the repo's
  tracked prose files at HEAD into `index.db` (`knowledge_chunks`), diffing
  stored git blob SHAs against `git ls-tree -r HEAD` so only changed files
  re-chunk; commit-SHA watermark (`knowledge_head_sha`) makes the steady
  state one rev-parse. Called by `index` (full) and recall (incremental,
  best-effort). See `docs/design/knowledge-layer.md`
- `checkpoint.go`: Capture session after commit — **no-op while a rebase is in
  progress** (`gitx.RebaseInProgress`, which reads git's `rebase-merge`/
  `rebase-apply` state dirs; `GIT_REFLOG_ACTION` is empty in the post-commit
  environment and cannot be used). git fires post-commit for every replayed
  commit, so a ten-commit rebase would run ten captures, and any whose transcript
  grew mid-rebase would link the live session to commits it never produced —
  false `checkpoint_sessions` edges, the commit↔session ground truth the
  benchmark labels itself from. `--amend`/cherry-pick are deliberately not
  covered: those are real authoring moments. A re-captured transcript
  **appends** to its existing session instead of storing the conversation again:
  a live conversation has different content at every commit, so keying dedup on
  content made each commit a brand-new session (measured 2.07× amplification and
  duplicate seeds crowding out recall). The transcript→session mapping lives in
  `checkpoint_state.session_id` — **local-only, never wired**; `sessions.session_hash`
  keeps its content-hash meaning because `local_import.go` dedups by comparing
  `session.ContentHash` against it, and overloading it would silently re-import
  every session this repo already captured. Appends only turns/tool-calls past
  `db.SessionExtent`, gated by `turnsExtend`: the parsed transcript must be the
  stored turns plus more, else capture falls back to a new session, so a
  rewritten or truncated transcript can never splice unrelated turns into
  history. Subagent parent lookup prefers the same mapping, falling back to the
  trunk's content hash for trunks captured before it. Old stores gain the column
  by migration and pay one extra session row at the boundary, which the index
  supersession pass then collapses. Also drains the L1 recall-graph
  spool into `data.db.recall_edges` (`drainRecallSpool`) while the data.db
  writer is held — even when no new session is captured (an agent may recall/
  drill inside an already-checkpointed session), refreshing `session_reach` via
  `db.RefreshSessionReach` on that path so the graph never stalls; otherwise the
  incremental index refresh rebuilds `session_reach`
- `push.go`: Push data to remote branch (wire encode/commit lives in `transport/`).
  Publishes to `--remote` (default `origin`) — the pre-push hook forwards the
  remote git is actually pushing to, so a push to a fork no longer sends memory
  to `origin`. Recursion is guarded by the `REKAL_INTERNAL_PUSH` env var rekal
  sets on its own git calls, replacing `--no-verify`, which suppressed *every*
  pre-push hook in the repo to solve a problem that is only rekal's. Each git
  network call runs under a deadline (`runGitDeadline`, `--timeout`, default 2m)
  with `cmd.WaitDelay` set — killing git is not enough, because a stuck remote
  helper or ssh child keeps the output pipe open and `CombinedOutput` blocks on
  it. A publication failure is a **warning** by default and an error only under
  `--strict`: every pre-push hook already installed runs a bare `rekal push`,
  so exiting non-zero there would abort the user's git push over a diverged
  memory branch. `--best-effort` is accepted as a hidden no-op so a hook from
  either version works against a binary from the other.
  **There is no `--force`**: SOUL.md makes the append-only wire format a
  *structural* guarantee, not a policy, and a flag that overwrites a branch
  would demote it to the latter. `rekal push` appends and can do nothing else;
  discarding a ref stays a git operation. No code path force-pushes at all —
  `--rebuild` parents its commit on the tip it fast-forwarded to, so its push is
  an ordinary fast-forward; `TestNoForcePushInSource` pins the absence. `--rebuild` (was `--re-export`, kept
  as a deprecated hidden alias) is the one path that rewrites the body —
  `ExportAllFrames` from an empty body, so it carries only this machine's
  `data.db` — and it refuses via `wouldDiscardRemoteFrames` unless every
  checkpoint git_sha the branch already holds is also present in the
  freshly regenerated body, making it a superset-only repair of derived
  bytes. Black-box tested and found broken at 1.0.0: the guard used to run
  *after* `CommitWireFormat`, checking whether the remote's commit was an
  ancestor of the local branch — but `doReExport` always fast-forwards local
  to the remote's tip first and commits the new body as a *child* of it, so
  that ancestry check was true by construction on every call, regardless of
  whether the body actually grew or shrank. A machine whose data.db was a
  strict subset of the branch (never ran `sync --self`, same identity on two
  machines) could run `--rebuild` and silently delete another machine's
  already-shared session, with no refusal and no warning. The fix moved the
  check *before* the commit, comparing the in-memory candidate body against
  the remote's — but a raw byte/prefix comparison there (which is what the
  ancestry check's fallback path already did, just unreachably) is *also*
  wrong: `--rebuild`'s whole point is a fresh zstd stream and dict, so even a
  correct, lossless rebuild is never a byte-for-byte prefix of what was on
  the branch, and byte comparison would refuse the safe, common case (a solo
  machine repairing its own data) too — confirmed by a pre-existing
  integration test (`TestPush_RebuildWorksWhenNothingIsLost`) that started
  failing under the first attempt. `checkpointGitSHAs` decodes both bodies
  (standalone and batched frames) and compares checkpoint identity —
  git_sha, stored as a plain string in the frame, needs no dict — so
  encoding differences never matter, only which checkpoints are actually
  present. `TestDoReExport_RefusesWhenLocalDataIsThinnerThanRemote` pins the
  original bug against a real two-clone remote
- `sync.go`: Sync team context (wire decode/import lives in `transport/`).
  Plain `rekal sync` checkpoints and pushes **your own** local work (step 1-2
  of `runSyncTeam`, both non-fatal) before it fetches — the round-trip is the
  point, `--self` skips both. `--help` didn't say so (black-box testing
  found the gap: an agent that only reads `--help`, per the design intent,
  had no way to know a plain `sync` also writes to the remote); the `Long`
  text now names it, matching `docs/spec/command/sync.md`, which already did.
  `indexSessionFrame` dedups an arriving session by **keeping the longest**: one
  conversation spanning several commits links to several checkpoints and rides in
  each one's frame, so the repeat would violate `session_facets`' primary key and
  abort the whole import. Frames from one export carry identical turns, but
  frames from *different pushes* do not — the author kept talking between them —
  so skipping the repeat would strand the reader on a truncated conversation;
  a longer arrival replaces the indexed rows. Could not arise before capture
  learned to append, when every checkpoint carried a distinct session.
  That dedup only catches the *same* session id arriving twice. A teammate
  whose store predates append-on-recapture ships one conversation as a chain of
  growing prefixes under **different** ids, so sync runs
  `db.PurgeSupersededSessionsWithData` after the import loop (before the counts,
  facets, FTS and reach) to collapse them — `PopulateIndex`'s own pass ran
  before any arrival existed. `db.PurgeBenchSessionsFromIndex` runs there for
  the same reason: `session.SkipCapture` guards *capture*, not import, so a
  teammate whose ledger predates it carries RekalBench fixtures that ride the
  wire forever (append-only), and the reader is the only one who can decline
  them. `indexSessionFrame` also writes each frame's **tool calls** to
  `tool_calls_index` (and the real `tool_call_count`): they have always ridden
  the wire — 30k across two teammates on one real store — and the team path
  decoded and dropped them, so everything built from that table saw only this
  machine's sessions. The facet document lost every teammate's file paths and
  command prefixes (`PopulateFacetText` reads it), and `file_cooccurrence`
  learned nothing from their work. The `--self` path always stored them.
  `--self` is the **one identity, two machines** path: it imports the user's own
  branch into **data.db** (team sync writes other people's branches to the index
  only). It **extends** an existing session rather than skipping it — a later
  frame is the same conversation grown, and skip-if-exists left the reader
  truncated at whatever length synced first, permanently; `appendGrownSession`
  appends past the stored extent under the same stored-turns-are-a-prefix guard
  capture uses, so a rewritten frame is refused whole. Imported checkpoints are
  marked **exported** (they arrived off the branch, so they are already on it;
  the schema default of FALSE made every self-sync hand the next push frames the
  body already carried). Both `--self` and `push` call
  `transport.FastForwardOrphanBranch`: the body is appended to the **local**
  branch tip, and that ref never moved after creation, so a machine that was
  behind built a body missing the other machine's frames and could only get past
  the rejection by hand or by a `--force` that deletes those frames.
  Fast-forward only — a genuine fork is left for `remoteDiverged` to report
- `init.go`: Bootstrap Rekal in a git repo — store, hooks, orphan branch,
  skill (tip + scripts + references), and one marker-tagged CLAUDE.md sentence
  (the whole DX: init, done; `clean` removes the line, refresh replaces it in
  place). Also runs the same structural `runIndex` pass `sync` does (FTS/LSA/
  facets/knowledge) and starts the background `rekal embed`, right after the
  initial checkpoint — init used to report success while leaving the index
  empty, so the first real recall silently absorbed a full rebuild with no
  forewarning; now init leaves the store exactly as ready as `sync` does.
  Non-fatal: a failure here just falls back to recall's own inline rebuild.
  `installSkill` pins the binary `Version` into each installed skill
  dir (`.claude/skills/<name>/.rekal-version`); `maybeRefreshStaleSkill` (called
  from recall) reads it and re-installs the skill when it's behind the running
  binary, so an upgrade reaches the repo without a manual re-init. Re-running
  `rekal init` on an already-initialized repo calls `refreshManaged` (skill +
  hooks + CLAUDE.md line + agent rules + gitignore); the recall-time
  auto-refresh deliberately does **only** the skill (gitignored), never the
  tracked/side-effectful assets. `installAgentInstructions` covers the
  non-Claude agents: it detects which are installed on the machine (home-dir
  probe — `~/.codex`, `~/.local/share/opencode`, `~/.cursor`, `~/.gemini`,
  `~/.copilot`, `~/.kiro`) and writes the marker-tagged `rekalAgentLine` into
  the file each reads — `AGENTS.md` (Codex/OpenCode/Cursor, written once),
  `GEMINI.md` (Gemini), `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (Copilot),
  `.kiro/steering/rekal.md` (Kiro) — via the generalized
  `ensureManagedLine`. Created-if-missing, replace-in-place on refresh, user
  content preserved; a file Rekal **newly creates** is gitignored (per-machine
  detection → local-only), while a file the user already tracked stays tracked
  with only the marker line injected
- `clean.go`: Remove Rekal setup — completely, no residue. `removeManagedLines`
  strips the marker line from CLAUDE.md and every detected-agent file (AGENTS.md
  / GEMINI.md / .github/copilot-instructions.md / .kiro/steering/rekal.md),
  deleting a file that was ours and pruning emptied `.github` / `.kiro/steering`
  / `.kiro`. Asks before deleting anything (`confirmClean`, `--yes`/`-y` to
  skip): a bare word reaches cobra as a command whether the caller quoted it or
  not, so `rekal "clean"` and `rekal clean` are the same argv — an agent
  recalling a user's phrasing could delete the store, and unpushed capture has
  no other copy. Consent is read, not inferred from a terminal check: `/dev/null`
  is a character device, so the usual is-a-tty heuristic calls a script's empty
  stdin interactive. EOF is a refusal. `Args: rejectExtraArgs` rejects extra
  words before the prompt is even reached; the refusal message names the real
  escape hatch (`rekal -- clean`) rather than quoting, which does not
  disambiguate a single word
- `index_cmd.go`: Rebuild index DB from data DB (structural: FTS/facets/LSA/
  knowledge chunks). Deep-semantic session + knowledge vectors are deferred
  to background `rekal embed` after the atomic rename. Also carries the
  cross-repo local-import flags (`--include-all`/`--include`/`--no-local`),
  which set a persistent preference and rebuild
- `embed_cmd.go`: `rekal embed` — fill missing semantic vectors in budgeted
  bites (session + knowledge), releasing the DuckDB write lock between
  passes so recall can interleave. Spawned by `index`/`sync`; safe to run
  by hand. Lock: `.rekal/embed.lock`; log when background: `.rekal/embed.log`.
  A bite reports whether it **stored** anything (`storedVectorCount` before/
  after), and the loop stops on a pass that wrote nothing while work remains.
  Both halves of a bite warn and swallow their errors and `knowledgeMore` is
  recomputed from the database, so a backend failing every call left "vectors
  still missing" true forever — measured at 353 identical no-op passes in one
  run, and `index`/`sync` spawn this in the background where it burns a core
  until killed. The stall message points at `.rekal/nomic/daemon.log`
- `config.go`: Two-tier config, both gitignored/local-only (never committed,
  pushed, or synced) — local `.rekal/config.json` deep-merges over global
  `~/.config/rekal/config.json` (path honors `$REKAL_CONFIG_HOME` then
  `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`), precedence local → global → built-in defaults. Merge is
  per-key: `embedding` inherits wholesale, `weights` field-by-field,
  `local_import` not inherited (per-repo), `scoring_lineage` **global-only**
  (machine diagnostic switch; ignored from local, never written to the repo
  file; default off — observe-only NDJSON of recall score lineage + stage
  timings to stderr or a lumberjack-rotated local path; envelope
  `ts`/`v`/`run_id`/`event` joins query→candidate→result). `readConfig` is
  local-only (the write path — the `--include*` flags read-modify-write it,
  so global values are never baked in); `readMergedConfig` is the
  consumption view (recall weights, index embedding, scoring lineage). Holds
  the cross-repo `local_import` preference,
  the recall-tuning `weights` (BM25/LSA/nomic layer mix — normalized to sum to
  1, and when the semantic layer has no vectors its share falls to LSA
  (`layers2`, 0.35/0.65), so LSA carries ~6× its enabled weight on a store that
  has never embedded; a weight of **0 disables its layer there too**, rather
  than having a switched-off LSA absorb the semantic share — steering boost,
  summary boost, subagent discount, facet boost, plus the opt-in
  `recency_boost` and `reach_boost` additive layers — recency over
  `session_facets.captured_at` (default 0.15, inert when candidates share a
  timestamp), reach over the L1 `session_reach` graph (default 0.2,
  self-activating — byte-identical until the graph has edges); both
  ranking-only, never the silence gate, `0` disables — applied at query time,
  no reindex), and
  the `embedding` section (OpenAI-compatible HTTP backend: endpoint/model/
  api_key with `$VAR` expansion and `api_key_env`; a Cohere Embed model under
  the `openai` provider auto-sends `input_type`)
- `local_import.go`: Cross-repo local session import — folds this machine's
  other local agent sessions (all registered adapters — Claude/Cursor/Codex/Gemini/OpenCode/Copilot/Kiro)
  into the index. **Index-only, never `data.db`**, so imported sessions are
  structurally unpushable to the team; origin-labeled, deduped by content hash
- `log.go`: Show recent checkpoints
- `query.go`: Raw SQL access (explicit `--sql "<stmt>"`; bare positional is
  shorthand; `--sql`/positional/`--session` mutually exclusive) + session drill.
  **Default output is agent-readable text** (`view.go`: readable turns / TSV
  rows); `--json` gives raw JSON/NDJSON. `--help` carries the full queryable
  schema (all tables + columns; FTS-internal/state tables noted as ignore). A
  successful `--session` drill spools an L1 recall-graph drill edge
  (`logDrillEdge` → `graph.Append`) — the strong "this memory was used" signal.
  SQL runs on a **read-only** handle (`db.OpenDataReadOnly`/`OpenIndexReadOnly`)
  and is limited to **one statement** (`hasTrailingStatement`). The leading
  `SELECT` check alone was not a guard: the driver executes every statement in
  the string it is handed, so `SELECT 1; DELETE FROM turns` emptied the
  append-only ledger and reported the delete count as a result. The statement
  check is only there to produce a plain sentence instead of a driver error —
  read-only is what makes it structural, per SOUL.md. A `;` inside a string
  literal, quoted identifier or comment is data, not a separator. A drilled
  session missing from **both** DBs used to surface as `session not found:
  query session: sql: no rows in result set` — the driver's own wording, not
  a sentence, and the wrapped error was the data-DB miss even on the
  index-DB fallback path. `sessionNotFoundError` checks `errors.Is(...,
  sql.ErrNoRows)` and reports the handle the caller typed instead; a real DB
  failure (not just "no rows") still surfaces its detail. The short-handle
  path (`sidMap.Resolve`) already had its own clean message — this only
  covered the full-ULID path
- `version.go`: Version constant (set via ldflags)
- `errors.go`: SilentError pattern for clean error output
- `preconditions.go`: Shared checks — `RequireInitializedRepo` (git repo +
  init done) plus the individual `EnsureGitRoot`/`EnsureInitDone` helpers

### Packages (`cmd/rekal/cli/`)

- `codec/`: Binary wire format — frame encoding/decoding, body, dictionary, preset zstd dictionary
- `transport/`: Git-side sync — encode checkpoints to the orphan-branch wire
  format and decode them back (`export`/`import`/remote-sync glue, orphan-branch
  commit). Sits above `codec`, `db`, and `gitx`; called by `push`/`sync`/`init`.
  `export` applies the **merged-only gate** (`filterMerged`), memoized against
  the mainline tip in `data.db.merge_gate_cache` (**local-only, never wired**,
  like `recall_edges` and `checkpoint_state`): a checkpoint held back because
  its branch was abandoned was re-litigating a commit-tree plus a `git cherry`
  on every push to reach the same answer. Keyed on git_sha + target tip +
  `MergeGateVersion`, so work that lands later re-evaluates and a rule change
  invalidates; strictly an accelerator, since every failure path falls through
  to the real predicates and the cache must never widen what leaves the machine: checkpoints reach
  the wire only when their `git_sha` is an ancestor of the default branch or
  their branch landed as a patch-equivalent squash commit — unmerged work
  stays local (see `docs/design/merged-only-sharing.md`). `gitx.DefaultBranch`
  prefers the **remote-tracking** ref (`origin/main`) over the local branch,
  which is right for an ordinary manual `rekal push` but wrong for the pre-push
  hook specifically: the hook fires before `git push` transfers anything, so
  `origin/main` is still whatever it was as of the last fetch — one full push
  behind a merge that just landed on local `main`. Judging ancestry against
  that stale ref held a checkpoint back until the *next*, unrelated push
  instead of the push that actually merged and published it (black-box tested:
  reproduced with a real bare-remote + two-clone setup, confirmed by
  instrumenting the real `filterMerged` call rather than reasoning about it —
  the two-machine test alone read as correct because by the time recall ran
  against it, a second push had already happened). `preferLocalIfAhead`
  upgrades `defaultRef` to the local branch when `origin/<name>` (as this
  checkout currently knows it) is an ancestor of local `<name>` — exactly the
  state right before a push that will make it true remotely. Local-only, no
  network call, so it can't see a divergence this checkout hasn't fetched yet;
  that gap is bounded by git itself refusing the code push as non-fast-forward
  when it exists, and is distinct from a divergence already visible locally
  (fetched, then diverged independently), which the ancestor check correctly
  declines to upgrade. An **already-exported**
  checkpoint is shareable unconditionally: it passed the gate once, and a commit
  rebased/squashed away after capture leaves an orphaned `git_sha` that can never
  re-prove (empty cumulative diff → the squash probe fails closed), so
  re-running the gate in `push --rebuild` would silently delete already-shared
  conversations from the branch. Export also withholds **superseded** sessions
  (`db.SupersededSessionIDs`) so one conversation is never shipped several times;
  it fails loud rather than shipping the duplicates it exists to prevent
- `gitx/`: Thin git-plumbing helpers (rev-parse, show, hash-object, config,
  `rekal/<email>` branch name, `DefaultBranch`/`IsAncestor`/`IsSquashMergedInto`/
  `BranchTip` for the merged-only export gate, `MainWorktreeRoot` for the
  worktree-shared store) shared by the command and transport layers
- `graph/`: L1 recall citation-graph spool — the lock-free write-ahead buffer
  (`.rekal/recall-log.ndjson`) that keeps query-time edge capture off data.db's
  writer. `Append` (best-effort, no-op under `session.BenchEnv`) on recall/drill;
  `Drain` (rename-to-tmp, partial-line-tolerant) at checkpoint. Transient
  buffer, not the store — the permanent record is `data.db.recall_edges`. See
  `docs/design/recall-graph.md`
- `knowledge/`: Prose-file chunker for the knowledge layer — markdown/plain
  text into heading-anchored sections (breadcrumb trails, 1-indexed line
  ranges, content hashes). Pure functions, no git/DB
- `search/`: Recall ranking engine — hybrid BM25 + LSA + Nomic scoring plus
  the additive facet layer (BM25 over per-session tool paths + command
  prefixes + steering text; `weights.facet_boost`, default 0.3, `0` =
  byte-identical pre-facet ranking; fails soft without a facet FTS index),
  the additive **recency** and **reach** layers (`weights.recency_boost`
  default 0.15 / `reach_boost` default 0.2; recency = min-max over
  `session_facets.captured_at`, reach = max-normalized L1 `session_reach.reach_count`
  via `loadCapturedAt`/`loadReachCounts`; additive before the subagent discount
  like facet, ranking-only — excluded from `absoluteConfidence`. Each
  self-inerts until it has signal — recency contributes 0 when candidates share
  a timestamp, reach is byte-identical on a cold store and fails soft on an
  index without the reach table; `0` disables the lookup),
  with configurable weights (`weights.go`; query-time only), signal weighting
  (steering-turn boost, compaction-summary boost, subagent down-weight),
  conversation grouping
  (see `docs/agent-metadata.md`), snippet extraction, the LSA
  query-projection cache (`projection.go`), absolute `confidence` + raw
  BM25 `mass` for silence gates (`confidence.go`; ranking still uses
  max-normalized `score`), thin-query rejection (empty/whitespace/single-char
  → empty hybrid, no knowledge), the top-level `semantic`
  `{status:"warming",retryable:true}` field (present only while the nomic daemon
  loads the model — recall degraded to keyword+LSA; the agent re-runs with
  backoff for full quality, taught by `SKILL.md`), the per-result short `sid`
  (`attachShortIDs`, `db.LoadSessionSIDMap` — ROW_NUMBER() over
  `session_facets` ordered by ULID, so it is only deterministic for a *fixed*
  index.db; recomputed live on every call, including at drill time — see
  `db/sid.go`), the per-result
  `summary_turn_index` pointer (latest compaction-summary turn — pointer,
  never the 10-17KB payload; drill with `--role summary`), the
  `--explain` enrichments (per-layer normalized scores + query-time
  related-session joins over `files_index`; default output unchanged
  without the flag), and optional scoring-lineage NDJSON (`lineage.go` —
  global `scoring_lineage` config only; default off; schema v3: per-layer
  raw/norm/contrib + stage `timings_ms` + candidate/returned `confidence`/`mass`
  + `result.knowledge` file hits with winning-chunk bm25/semantic;
  `result.semantic{used,backend,model}` names the real embedder —
  `http`|`embedded` + model id — distinct from the historical layer key
  `nomic` in weights/timings/skipped. `query.weights_normalized` is the 3-way
  mix the engine *intends* — it is emitted before the semantic layer reports
  whether it has vectors — so `result.weights_effective` is the one to read
  when `semantic.used` is false: the 2-way fallback reassigns the semantic
  share and the two disagree by design. Observe-only, ranking unchanged), and
  the **knowledge layer** (`knowledge.go` — hybrid
  BM25 + chunk-vector cosine over prose-file chunks at HEAD, blended with the
  `layers2` keyword/semantic split, query vector shared from the session
  semantic pass; chunks scored / files returned as pointers with
  anchor + lines + `sessions` provenance edge; separate additive `knowledge`
  block above `results`, never merged with session ranking; fails soft
  without a knowledge FTS index, and to keyword-only without chunk vectors —
  `docs/design/knowledge-layer.md`)
- `session/`: AI-session parsing — extract turns, tool calls, deduplicate. One
  `Adapter` per agent (`adapter.go` registry): `claude`, `cursor`, `codex`,
  `gemini`, `opencode`, `copilot`, `kiro` — each `Discover`s that agent's
  session files for the repo and `Parse`s them into a `SessionPayload`. `kiro.go`
  (`KiroAdapter`) reads **both** Kiro CLI and IDE sessions (Parse dispatches on
  the ref extension). CLI: `$KIRO_HOME/sessions/cli/<id>.json` (metadata:
  `session_id`/`cwd`/`title`/`created_at` — `cwd` gives the exact repo match) +
  `<id>.jsonl` (v3 event log
  `{"kind":"Prompt"|"AssistantMessage","data":{"content":[{"kind":"text","data":"…"}]}}`).
  IDE: the Code-OSS global storage (`$KIRO_IDE_STORAGE` override; else
  macOS `~/Library/Application Support/Kiro`, Linux `~/.config/Kiro`, Windows
  `%APPDATA%/Kiro`) at `User/globalStorage/kiro.kiroagent/workspace-sessions/<ws>/`
  — `sessions.json` index (`workspaceDirectory` repo match, `dateCreated`,
  `hidden`) + `<sessionId>.json` (`{history:[{message:{role,content}}]}`,
  content string or `[{type,text}]`). Both schemas verified against the
  community readers (prabhugr/kiro-cli-history, pajaydev/kiro-history) since
  Kiro's is unpublished; tool blocks have no documented shape so they're
  best-effort/fail-soft. `$KIRO_HOME` defaults to `~/.kiro`.
  `SkipCapture` refuses RekalBench/harness sessions (`REKAL_BENCH` /
  `REKAL_SKIP_CHECKPOINT`, bench cwd, gen_queries prompt fingerprints) so
  synthetic fixtures are never checkpointed or locally imported into a
  real store.
  Turn roles: `human`, `human_steering` (queue-operation captures), `assistant`,
  `summary` (isCompactSummary compaction distillations; rows written before the
  role existed stay `human` in append-only data.db and are reclassified by
  content fingerprint in the derived views, scoped to source='claude' sessions
  so other agent types are untouched — `db.SummaryFingerprint`).
  `local.go` enumerates/resolves project session dirs under `~/.claude/projects/*`
  for the cross-repo local import
- `scrub/`: Redact secrets, anonymize file paths, and guarantee valid UTF-8 (`SanitizeText`) before any DB insert — sessions (`checkpoint` / cross-repo import after parse) and knowledge chunks (`knowledge.ChunkFile` + `db.InsertKnowledgeChunks`). DuckDB rejects invalid-UTF-8 VARCHAR binds, so this is the last-line guard against `could not bind parameter` (prose `.txt` dumps with binary/truncated runes used to abort the whole knowledge-layer transaction).
- `db/`: DuckDB backend — the session **embedding document** is budgeted, not
  the raw transcript (`buildSessionDoc`): intent turns (`human`/
  `human_steering`/`summary`) are admitted first and in full, assistant turns
  share a bounded slice (1/10 of the window) spread equally across the session.
  Mean pooling makes a vector a byte-weighted average, and assistant turns are
  84.4% of the bytes against steering's 1.0% — so the old whole-transcript
  document embedded mostly "let me check that file", which reads alike in every
  session and pulled them toward one point; positional truncation then cut the
  late turns, which is where decisions land. Measured on 36 sessions: real
  sessions' mean cosine 0.5285 → 0.5737 with a two-turn `"Reply with exactly:
  OK"` echo unchanged at 0.5323 (all movement is real sessions improving), top
  slot real on 7/8 queries instead of 5/8. `QuerySessionContent` and
  `QuerySessionContentByIDs` share the builder — they write the same column
  under the same model id, so a divergence would make a vector depend on which
  path reached it. `nomic.ModelName` bumped to `nomic-v1.5-c8k-d1`; the old id
  is in `supersededNomicModels` so an index still holding it says
  "run `rekal embed`". Also — open, close, schema (incl. the
  `(session_id, turn_index)` index on `turns`/`turns_ft`, created in
  `MigrateDataSchema` as well as the DDL so long-lived stores — the ones that
  need it most — gain it in place), insert helpers, index
  population (incl. `PopulateFacetText` — per-session facet documents from
  the index's own tables, full + incremental, and now including each session's
  **full commit message** via `PopulateCommitMessages` — subject *and* body,
  resolved from the reader's own clone by the batched `gitx.CommitMessages`.
  Index-only and never in `data.db`: SOUL.md's "strip what git already has"
  rules it off the wire, which is also what makes it free for teammates — the
  wire ships only the SHA and each reader resolves the text locally. It rides
  the existing `facet_boost`, so `0` disables it and an empty column is
  byte-identical to before. Its prerequisite was a real bug: the wire import
  wrote the checkpoint anchor with an `UPDATE`, which DuckDB rejects with a
  spurious duplicate-key error on this PRIMARY KEY table, and the error was
  swallowed — so **no synced session had a `git_sha` at all** (2 of 35 on a
  real store) and `--commit` was blind to the whole team. Now delete-then-
  reinsert, and loud on failure — and the guarded
  `CreateFacetFTSIndex`, built by `index`/`sync` only when facet material
  exists). `PurgeSupersededSessionsFromIndex` collapses re-captures written
  before capture keyed on ref identity, dropping them from the **index only** —
  data.db keeps every copy, since the ledger is append-only and those rows are
  already on the wire. Prefix comparison is one bulk read of per-turn
  hashes (`loadTurnHashes`) followed by in-memory set comparison — it was a
  `FULL OUTER JOIN` over the turns table **per candidate pair**, and pairs grow
  quadratically inside a group: measured at 1.19 s per join on a 100-session
  fixture, so ~4,950 pairs was over an hour of joins with data.db held open,
  against 28 ms for the whole pass now. Two rules, in order: `collapseEqualRecaptures` maps away
  sessions whose **whole ordered transcript** hashes identically (one `md5`
  over `string_agg(role||content ORDER BY turn_index)` in the grouping query,
  so exact copies fall out of a `GROUP BY` rather than a comparison per pair;
  smallest id wins, which for ULIDs is the copy captured first), then the
  prefix pass maps a session whose turns are a strict prefix of a longer one's
  onto that longer one. The exact rule exists because the prefix pass compares
  only against **strictly longer** sessions, so identical copies never meet it
  — the same conversation arriving by two routes (a wire import beside the
  local capture it came from, two peers that both carry it) cost a recall seed
  each. `flattenSupersession` then resolves old → **final** survivor: the two
  rules chain, and every consumer deletes all the keys, so a value that is
  itself a key would strand a subagent parent or a reach count on a session
  that is gone. Grouped by source + author + parent + turn 0 so different
  agents that open alike are never merged; runs before facets/reach so neither
  is computed for a session about to be dropped. Sessions the data DB never saw — every
  **synced teammate session**, which the wire import writes straight to
  `turns_ft` + `session_facets` — take their discriminators from
  `session_facets` (+ `origin`, which labels cross-repo local imports),
  otherwise the key degrades to turn 0 alone and two people who opened with the
  same prompt get merged. `PurgeSupersededSessionsWithData` is the entry point
  for callers **outside** `PopulateIndex`: that function detaches `data_db` when
  it returns, so a bare purge afterwards finds no metadata and silently collapses
  nothing. `sync` uses it after the remote imports — `PopulateIndex`'s own pass
  runs before a single arrival exists. `knowledge.go` holds the knowledge layer's tables
  (`knowledge_chunks` + `knowledge_embeddings`, created on demand by
  `EnsureKnowledgeSchema` so old index DBs upgrade in place), the guarded
  `CreateKnowledgeFTSIndex`, and the chunk-vector helpers (missing-vectors
  join for budgeted convergence, content-hash-keyed store/query, orphan
  pruning). `reach.go` holds the L1 recall citation graph: the permanent
  append-only `recall_edges` (data.db, **local-only — never wired**, like
  `checkpoint_state`) via `InsertRecallEdges`, and the derived `session_reach`
  aggregate (index.db, created on demand by `EnsureReachSchema`) via
  `PopulateSessionReach` (from `recall_edges` in full + incremental index) and
  `LoadReach` (the hot-path hint read). `embedcache.go` is the
  content-hash-keyed embedding cache
  (`.rekal/embed-cache.db`, vectors only): rebuilds embed only unseen content;
  a model switch invalidates by key construction
- `embedhttp/`: HTTP embedding client — batched, hard-timeboxed so the
  post-commit hook can never stall; selected over the embedded nomic model
  via config. Two providers: `openai` (default; any OpenAI-compatible
  `/embeddings` server — vLLM/Ollama/TEI, or a gateway; a Cohere Embed model
  here auto-sends `input_type` and client-caps each input at 2048 chars so
  Portkey/Bedrock gateways that 400 before server-side truncate still work)
  and `bedrock` (Amazon Bedrock runtime, Cohere Embed models, bearer API key,
  no SigV4 — asymmetry via Cohere `input_type` not text prefixes)
- `lsa/`: Latent Semantic Analysis embeddings. `Embed` truncates at the
  **numerical** rank, not just exactly-zero singular values: the projection
  divides by each one, and `actualDim` is capped at `nDocs`, so any store with
  fewer sessions than `DefaultDimension` (128) factorizes to full rank with
  trailing singular values zero to within rounding. Dividing by 1e-16 turns
  rounding error into a ~1e16 coefficient that owns the vector's norm and every
  cosine against it — measured at a squared norm of 1.2e30, with every
  document's cosine collapsing to 0 (the layer silently returning nothing).
  The cutoff is relative to the largest singular value (the standard
  pseudo-inverse rule), a floating-point tolerance rather than a ranking
  weight, and it is inert on a corpus of genuinely independent sessions
- `nomic/`: Nomic-embed-text deep semantic embeddings (platform build tags).
  Model loading is isolated in a **single-flight daemon** (`daemon.lock` flock,
  one per store) that loads the model **before** opening its socket — so a
  connectable socket means "ready", and a native model-load crash kills the
  disposable daemon, never the caller. Idle shutdown is measured from the last
  **completed** request and never fires while one is in flight (`idleVerdict`):
  the timer used to be reset when a request was *read*, so a single batch of
  8192-token documents — minutes of CPU — outlived the 5-minute timeout and the
  loop returned mid-request, running the deferred `embedder.Close()` while a
  handler was still inside the model (353 discarded batches in one embed run,
  and the likeliest source of an observed segfault). The daemon calls
  `SetVerbose(true)` so
  llama.cpp's own diagnostics survive — `suppress_stderr` in `embed.c` sends
  them to `/dev/null` around load *and* inference, which is right for a
  terminal and wrong for the daemon, whose stderr is a file. It is why a SIGILL
  and a segfault both left an empty log. `REKAL_NOMIC_DEBUG` turns it on for
  the in-process path too. The spawned daemon's stderr goes to
  `.rekal/nomic/daemon.log` (truncated per spawn): a daemon that can *never*
  start is otherwise indistinguishable from one still warming, and recall tells
  the agent to retry with backoff forever. `socketPath` falls back to a private
  runtime dir keyed by a hash of the store root when
  `<gitroot>/.rekal/nomic/daemon.sock` would exceed 103 bytes — `sockaddr_un`
  bounds the whole path (108 Linux / 104 macOS incl. NUL), so a deep checkout
  made the daemon load the model and then die on `bind: invalid argument`,
  every spawn. Single-flight is unaffected: it comes from the flock on a
  regular file, which has no length limit. **Build llama.cpp with
  `-DGGML_NATIVE=OFF`** (CI, release, and `docs/cloud-agent-setup.md` all do):
  ggml defaults it ON, which is `-march=native`, so a binary built on a runner
  with AVX512-VBMI takes SIGILL loading the model on a CPU without it. `NewClient(gitRoot, wait)`: recall passes
  `wait=false` (degrade to keyword/LSA now, daemon warms for next call);
  `rekal embed` passes `wait=true` (block for the model, bounded). Cache
  extraction is flock-serialized; spawns are cooldown-rate-limited. This is the
  fix for the concurrent-recall model-load crash.
  `embed.c`'s `MAX_TOKENS` (8192 — **not** the model's trained window; this
  GGUF reports `n_ctx_train = 2048` and llama.cpp logs `n_ctx_seq (8192) >
  n_ctx_train (2048) -- possible training context overflow` on every load) is
  the hard
  truncation point: a session is embedded as one concatenated document, so
  anything past the cap is **discarded, not blurred** — and decisions land late
  in a conversation. It was 2048, which meant the neural layer never saw the
  end of any real session. **`MAX_TOKENS` and `ModelName` move together**:
  `session_embeddings` and `embed_cache` are both keyed by model, so bumping
  the window without bumping the name leaves old vectors matching and the
  change is a silent no-op on every existing store (and mixes two vector
  spaces in one column if anything does re-embed). `ModelName` is duplicated
  across the cgo/nocgo build-tag files — change both, and add the retired id to
  `supersededNomicModels` (recall.go) so an index still carrying it warns
  "run `rekal embed`" instead of the misleading "no embedding config is set"
- `skill/`: One Claude Code skill, **scriptless** for retrieval/navigation —
  those moved into the binary as commands (`docs/design/skill-into-command.md`).
  `skills/rekal/` embeds `SKILL.md` (thin route: 4-substrate triage —
  tree/knowledge/ledger/map — boundary, silence, dispatch, judgment; trusts
  reasoning, no profiles; plus the **ledger workflow gate** — a ledger question
  classifies the requested *answer type* and loads exactly one specialist
  workflow, followed by a shared `### Final answer check` contract), `scripts/`
  (only the workflow gates now — `map.sh` fresh|watermark, `wiki-gate.sh`), and
  `references/` (rich, on demand — `ledger.md` is the one page on reasoning over
  the past: recall/widen/depth-judgment, time-axis, enumeration, whose-fact/
  premise, analytical SQL, decision arcs, provenance; plus `map.md`, `wiki.md`,
  `reference.md`, and `references/workflows/` — the five answer-type specialists
  the gate routes to: `duration.md`, `complete-set.md`, `event-time.md`,
  `inference.md`, `point-fact.md`, each a concentrated evidence contract, not
  truth. Ordered/exclusive routing + shipped content are hash-pinned in
  `skill_test.go`). The
  agent uses the commands directly — `rekal "<q>"` (seed digest, `digest.go`,
  auto-widened via `deriveFramings` + RRF), `rekal find`, `rekal query
  --session`/`--sql` (readable text via `view.go`); all default to compact text,
  `--json` for raw (SOUL: agent-first output is text, JSON on opt-in). No corpus
  profiles or benchmark tuning ship. `init` installs the tree (scripts 0755) and
  purges legacy `rekal-*` companion dirs; `clean` removes current + legacy. The
  route/gate scripts (route/view/find/seek/when.py) were removed once the
  commands proved byte-identical (golden/diff-tested); the property harness
  `scripts/skill-permtest.py` now drives `rekal "<q>"` directly.
  This skill ships **only** in the binary. The Claude Code plugin (`plugin/`,
  listed by the repo-root `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`) is **setup-only**:
  two skills — `/rekal:install` (once per machine) and `/rekal:init` (once per
  repository, the recurring one, and deliberately silent on a repo that merely
  lacks `.rekal/`) — plus `bin/rekal-install`, a byte-identical vendored copy of
  `scripts/install.sh` that puts the installer on the Bash `PATH` instead of
  piping a live URL into a shell (`TestPlugin_VendoredInstaller` pins the copy).
  It carries no recall material — no `skills/rekal`, `references/`, or
  `scripts/`. The split is the point: a plugin tracks `main` while an installed
  binary does not, so shipping the recall skill in both would load two copies at
  once and let the newer one describe flags the user's binary lacks. One owner,
  no divergence — pinned by `TestPlugin_SetupOnly` in `skill_test.go`. The
  plugin versions on its own line (`plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, not the
  binary's `v0.2.x`) — **bump it whenever the setup skill changes**, or
  self-hosted-marketplace users stay pinned; `claude plugin validate --strict`
  (what the submission pipeline runs) rejects a missing version.
  Topology diagrams: `docs/design/skill-router.md`.
  Distribution + the community-marketplace submission path:
  `docs/design/plugin-distribution.md`.
- `versioncheck/`: Auto-update notification
- `integration_test/`: Integration tests (`//go:build integration`)

### Docs (`docs/`)

- `DEVELOPMENT.md`: Dev process, testing, CI/CD
- `commands.md`: Flat CLI reference — the four routes (tree/knowledge/ledger/map),
  every command with its full flag table incl. **short forms**, digest header
  semantics (`top`/`gap`/`reached`), exit codes, and when `--force` is safe.
  `--help` stays authoritative; a disagreement is a bug
- `usage.md`: Operational guide the README links out to — two databases,
  orphan branches & merged-work-only sharing, worktrees, the full agent
  command surface + skill, cross-repo recall
- `configuration.md`: `.rekal/config.json` reference — ranking weights,
  embedding backends, API-key handling (the deep content the README's
  Configuration section links to)
- `compatibility.md`: what the version number covers, effective at 1.0 — the
  append-only `data.db` (migrated forward on open, no mutation path), the
  magic+version wire format (readers skip frames they can't parse, so an old
  teammate keeps working), the flag surface, the `0`/`1` exit codes agents
  branch on, and additive config (unknown keys ignored — plain `json.Unmarshal`,
  no `DisallowUnknownFields`). Explicitly **not** covered: `index.db`'s schema,
  the tables reachable through `query --sql`, ranking/scores, the installed
  skill's internals, stderr wording, `REKAL_HUNT_*`. Freezing ranking would
  freeze the product; the `--sql` surface is the one place "documented" does
  not mean "stable". Deprecations keep a hidden alias for a major version
- `git-transportation.md`: Git transport layer design
- `design/skill-router.md`: Unified skill — substrate triage, progressive
  disclosure, executable gate scripts (mermaid)
- `design/skill-into-command.md`: Interface-lock design for folding the skill
  scripts into the binary — default-uplift principle (agent form by default,
  `--json` raw), command boundaries (retrieval/navigation/lifecycle, one verb
  each), the skill↔command seam, and the byte-identical / no-performance-change
  migration contract
- `design/recall-graph.md`: L1 recall citation graph — query-time edge capture
  (recall + drill), the lock-free spool → checkpoint drain → `recall_edges`
  (permanent, local-only) → `session_reach` (derived) path, the display-only
  `[reached N×]` hint, and the non-goals (source attribution, authority
  ranking, team-sharing)
- `design/plugin-distribution.md`: Claude Code plugin packaging — why the plugin
  is setup-only (the binary stays the single owner of the recall skill; a plugin
  tracks `main`, an installed binary does not), why the binary cannot ship
  inside it, self-hosted marketplace vs. the community marketplace's
  form-not-PR submission path, and the non-goals
- `db/`: Database schema and design — `overview.md` is the map (`.tables` for
  both DBs, a mermaid flow of data.db → index.db → wire, which four tables are
  local-only and why, the lifecycle, and what losing each DB costs);
  `README.md` is the column-by-column detail for all 21 tables
- `research/`: Memory-research program — positioning claim + evidence ladder,
  18-paper literature map, RekalBench spec (self-labeled repo-grounded intent
  recall), local-corpus data plan, literature-derived product roadmap,
  the multi-repo-at-scale + Rekal-usage/effectiveness eval strategy
  (`06-eval-strategy.md`), the working-backwards flagship-paper restructure —
  git-bound memory, tool + skill + router, answer-sufficiency per token
  (`07-paper-restructure.md`), and `paper/` (Typst + PDF + LaTeX of the
  flagship "Why Git Is the Memory Solution for the Agentic Development
  Lifecycle", accepted as [arXiv:2607.14390](https://arxiv.org/abs/2607.14390);
  supersedes v1 "The Commit Is the Label" in git history;
  single-corpus values from `runs/single-corpus/manifest.json`, multi-corpus
  and sufficiency values from `runs/consolidated/manifest.json` —
  anonymized by workload class). The
  runnable harness lives in `scripts/bench/` (corpus card, T1–T3 + T4
  multi-hop label mining, T5 candidate miner, query generation with leakage
  filter + multi-hop validation, system runner incl. weight ablations +
  grep-rank baseline with UUID→ULID sidmap join, scorer with T4 both@10,
  dev-tuned/test-validated weight tuner, `usage_mine.py` for observational
  Rekal-usage/effectiveness signals, `mine_wild.py` for real in-the-wild
  recall — replaying actual queries against the sessions agents drilled into,
  with cross-repo drills flagged — and `run_rung2.py` for LLM-judged answer
  quality with distinct answer/judge models, prompts committed under
  `scripts/bench/prompts/`). The full multi-repo run sequence + the paper's
  data pack is `docs/research/RUN.md`
- `spec/preconditions.md`: Shared checks for all commands
- `spec/command/`: One file per command — checkpoint, clean, embed, find, index, init, log, push, query, recall, sync

### Demo (`scripts/demo/`)

- `record.py` + `conversation.json`: generate the README's demo. Not a staged
  screencast — **two panes, two machines, git drawn between them**, because the
  team hop is the part that needs no server and it was invisible in a
  single-terminal frame. Left pane (Dana): the 37-turn `conversation.json`
  session is planted in Claude Code's JSONL format, the real `rekal init` runs
  (so the real skill is installed), a commit fires the real post-commit hook,
  and `git push` publishes to a real bare remote. **`init` is the only rekal
  command the authoring side types** — capture and publication ride the
  `git commit`/`git push` a developer already runs, so the frame shows the
  workflow the README promises instead of teaching a manual `rekal push` step
  nobody needs. Right pane (Sam): a second clone runs `rekal sync`, then a real
  headless `claude -p` session loads the skill, recalls, drills and answers that
  the fixed delay was already rejected. Only the corpus is invented.
  The frame carries **one claim**: a conversation becomes memory, and that
  memory reaches a teammate over plain git. The merged-only guarantee, the
  recall graph and the knowledge layer are real and documented, but a demo that
  argues three things argues none — an earlier cut showed the unmerged spike
  being held back and it competed with the pitch rather than supporting it.
  Both `~/.claude/projects/<sanitized>` dirs are cleared **before** anything
  runs, not only after: a previous recording at the same workdir maps to the
  same path, and a leftover transcript there was captured by `rekal init`, which
  put the demo's own prompt into the store and ranked it *above* the memory the
  demo exists to show. `cast.json` keeps the raw run — including calls the frame
  drops — and **agent rows are expanded at render time** (`expand`), so a
  display-filter mistake is fixed by `--from-cast` instead of re-running a
  nondeterministic agent until it looks right. Dropped from the frame:
  `--help`/`--json` calls (the agent orienting, not recalling) and shell errors
  from script paths the agent guessed at (its noise, not rekal's output).
  `pick()` reads **both** streams — rekal writes progress to stderr, and reading
  stdout alone silently dropped the `sync` and `push` result lines. The SVG is
  hand-emitted (CSS-only, `prefers-reduced-motion` honored) so regenerating
  needs no asciinema/vhs/ffmpeg and stays diffable; it **plays once and holds**
  rather than looping, since a loop makes a reader who missed a line wait a
  whole cycle. The frame is **stamped with the binary that produced it**
  (`recorded from rekal <version>`, read from `cast.json`'s `recorded_from`):
  a re-record against a new release is otherwise pixel-identical to the old
  one, so the README's "recording of the released binary" claim was not
  checkable from the image. The demo writes into the real `~/.claude/projects/<sanitized>/`
  because `claude` needs its own config dir for auth, and removes those dirs
  afterwards.

### Community files (repo root)

- `CONTRIBUTING.md`: What a contribution has to satisfy — SOUL.md's eight
  questions as the review bar, the explicit decline list (server, telemetry,
  required API key, any mutation/forgetting path over `data.db`, corpus-tuned
  constants in skill scripts, a rule where a function would do), the
  fmt/lint/test:ci gate, the doc-sync rule (CLAUDE.md + `--help` +
  `docs/spec/command/` in the same change), test placement, commit convention
  (`type(scope): what changed`), and the binding benchmark honesty rules for
  `scripts/bench/` + `scripts/industry-bench/`
- `SECURITY.md`: Private reporting via GitHub advisories, and the threat model
  that follows from the architecture — in scope is anything putting material on
  the wire that should stay local (redaction/path-anonymization failure, a
  `filterMerged` bypass, cross-repo import reaching `data.db`, `recall_edges`/
  `checkpoint_state`/config on the wire), credential handling, untrusted wire
  frames and transcripts, and local integrity (append-only violations,
  `.rekal/` state permissions). Out of scope: recall quality, `query --sql`,
  what an agent does with what it recalls. Also the secret-in-the-ledger
  remedy: rotate first, branch surgery second, report the redaction gap
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`: Contributor Covenant 2.1; reports via GitHub *Report
  content* or a maintainer DM in Discord

## Development

### Running Tests

```bash
mise run test              # Unit tests only
mise run test:integration  # Integration tests only
mise run test:ci           # All tests (unit + integration) with race detection
mise run test:coverage     # All tests + statement coverage (writes coverage.html)
```

### Linting and Formatting

```bash
mise run fmt           # Format code (gofmt)
mise run lint          # Lint check (gofmt + golangci-lint)
```

### Building

```bash
mise run build         # Build binary with version from git tag
mise run build:all     # Build for all platforms (snapshot)
```

The DuckDB FTS extension is embedded so recall works offline, on the same
three platforms as nomic and the release matrix (linux/amd64, linux/arm64,
darwin/arm64). The linux/amd64 and darwin/arm64 blobs are committed under
`cmd/rekal/cli/db/extensions/`; the linux/arm64 blob is gitignored and
downloaded at build time by `scripts/fetch-fts-extension.sh` (a `mise run
build` dependency, also run in the release workflow), versioned off
go-duckdb's own DuckDB pin. Building **directly** with `go build` on
linux/arm64 needs `mise run fetch-extensions` first; otherwise the
`//go:embed` fails on the missing blob. On any other platform,
`db.LoadFTSExtension` falls back to a one-time network download.

**Cloud agents / fresh containers:** the cold-start is build → init → sync →
verify, and it has three traps — llama.cpp HEAD won't link (pin tag `b8157`),
the nomic model ships as a git-LFS pointer (`git lfs pull` or recall silently
drops to BM25+LSA), and the installed `.claude/skills/rekal/` copy goes stale
after a rebuild. A **released** binary (versioned via ldflags) self-heals: the
first recall after an upgrade sees the pinned-version mismatch and refreshes the
skill in place. A **dev** rebuild keeps `Version="dev"`, so the marker still
matches and the auto-refresh won't fire — re-run `rekal init` to refresh it
(data is untouched). Follow
[`docs/cloud-agent-setup.md`](docs/cloud-agent-setup.md) — it has the exact
steps, the data-sync sequence (`rekal init` + `rekal sync`), the
semantic-layer verification, and the no-mise dev-loop fallbacks. Don't repeat
the setup mistakes, and never judge recall quality before the verify step.

### Before Every Commit

```bash
mise run fmt && mise run lint && mise run test:ci
```

### Test Organization

Unit tests (`_test.go` next to source, same package). Always use `t.Parallel()`.

Integration tests (`integration_test/`, `//go:build integration`). Use `TestEnv` pattern — isolated temp git repos per test. Tests public API only. Cannot be parallelized (uses `os.Chdir`).

## Code Patterns

### Error Handling — SilentError

- `root.go` sets `SilenceErrors: true` globally
- Commands return `NewSilentError(err)` when they've already printed a user-friendly message
- For normal errors, return the error directly

```go
if err := EnsureGitRoot(); err != nil {
    cmd.SilenceUsage = true
    fmt.Fprintln(cmd.ErrOrStderr(), err)
    return NewSilentError(err)
}
```

### Shared Preconditions

All commands except `init` and `clean` must call both:
1. `EnsureGitRoot()` — verifies inside a git repo
2. `EnsureInitDone(gitRoot)` — verifies `.rekal/` exists

### Command Structure

```go
func newFooCmd() *cobra.Command {
    cmd := &cobra.Command{
        Use:   "foo",
        Short: "Short description",
        RunE: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) error {
            cmd.SilenceUsage = true
            gitRoot, err := EnsureGitRoot()
            if err != nil {
                fmt.Fprintln(cmd.ErrOrStderr(), err)
                return NewSilentError(err)
            }
            if err := EnsureInitDone(gitRoot); err != nil {
                fmt.Fprintln(cmd.ErrOrStderr(), err)
                return NewSilentError(err)
            }
            // command logic
            return nil
        },
    }
    return cmd
}
```

### CLI Output Voice

From the soul: short sentences, plain words, say what happened, say what to do, stop.

```
rekal: not a git repository (run this inside a project)
rekal: captured 3 sessions, 847 turns
rekal: no sessions match "JWT expiry" in src/auth/
```

No exclamation marks. No emoji. No "oops."

## Go Code Style

- Write lint-compliant Go code on the first attempt
- Follow standard Go idioms: proper error handling, no unused variables/imports
- Handle all errors explicitly
- Reference `.golangci.yaml` for enabled linters (govet, errcheck, ineffassign, staticcheck, unused)

## Release Process

1. Ensure main is green (CI, Lint, License Check)
2. Tag and push:
   ```bash
   git tag v0.x.y
   git push origin v0.x.y
   ```
3. Release workflow validates then publishes via GoReleaser

Rekal memory is active here — before non-trivial work, use the `rekal` skill and route: grep the tree for present-tense code, `rekal` knowledge for present prose at HEAD, the ledger (`rekal` + gates) for past intent, the map for structure. <!-- managed by rekal -->
