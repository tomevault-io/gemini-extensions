# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

`bonsai-lint` is a multi-language cognitive complexity linter written in Rust. It reads source
through tree-sitter grammars without executing any of it; the README lists the supported
languages. One static binary, no language runtime or toolchain required to run the analysis. It
ships as a Cargo workspace plus an independent VS Code extension.

## Commands

```bash
cargo fmt --all -- --check                          # formatting (rustfmt.toml: 100 cols)
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo test --all-features                            # whole workspace
cargo test -p bonsai-lang-php                         # one crate
cargo test -p bonsai-lang-php --test grammar          # one integration test file
cargo build --release                                 # produces target/release/bonsai-lint
RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings" cargo doc --no-deps --workspace --all-features
cargo deny check                                      # advisories, licenses, duplicates: deny.toml
cargo shear                                           # dependencies nothing uses
cargo hack build -p bonsai-lint --feature-powerset    # every language subset, including none
typos                                                 # spelling; deliberate misspellings: _typos.toml
taplo fmt --check                                     # TOML formatting: .taplo.toml
zizmor .github                                        # workflow security: .github/zizmor.yml
cargo llvm-cov --workspace --all-features --summary-only   # test coverage, per file
```

The last seven are separate tools:
`cargo install --locked cargo-deny cargo-shear cargo-hack typos-cli taplo-cli zizmor cargo-llvm-cov`,
and coverage also needs `rustup component add llvm-tools-preview`.

Every action in the workflows is pinned to a commit, with its version in a comment, and every
workflow but `release.yml` defaults to a read-only token. A new `uses:` line follows the same
form, and `zizmor` fails CI until it does.

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs exactly the commands above but the coverage, plus a test
matrix across Linux/macOS/Windows, a build-only check on the MSRV read from `Cargo.toml`
(`rust-version`), and the tests on `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`, the only build that swaps in
mimalloc (it needs `musl-tools`, so on macOS run it in an `ubuntu` container). Match these locally
before pushing rather than relying on CI to catch it.

Coverage runs in `.github/workflows/coverage.yml`, on pull requests only, and reports rather than
gates. Each run rewrites one comment on the pull request, found by its
`<!-- bonsai-lint-coverage -->` marker, with the totals and a line per crate. The only job allowed
to comment runs none of the pull request's code; a fork's pull request gets the table in the run
summary instead. Doc tests are not counted, since collecting them needs nightly, and neither is the
separate wasm workspace. Mutation testing is too slow for CI and runs on demand; see Testing
conventions.

Every language is behind a cargo feature; `vue` implies `ts` because it reuses that spec. The
registry must keep compiling with any feature subset, including none — this is exercised, not
incidental, so don't add code that assumes a language is always present without a `#[cfg]` guard
matching the existing pattern.

VS Code extension (`editors/vscode/`, own `package.json`, independent version number):

```bash
cd editors/vscode
npm ci
npx tsc -p . --noEmit      # typecheck
npm test                    # compiles then runs node --test on out/*.test.js
npx --yes @vscode/vsce package --out /tmp/extension.vsix
```

PyPI wheels and the pre-commit hook (`pypi/`, stdlib-only Python 3.11+, which macOS's `python3`
is not, so `uv` supplies it). CI runs these as its `PyPI wheel builder` and `pre-commit hook`
jobs:

```bash
uv run --no-project --python 3.12 python -m unittest discover pypi   # the wheel builder's tests
uv run --no-project --python 3.12 python pypi/build_wheels.py binary \
    --binary target/debug/bonsai-lint --target aarch64-apple-darwin --out /tmp/wheels
bash pypi/hook-smoke.sh /tmp/wheels   # pre-commit try-repo on the committed hook, from that wheel
```

`bonsai-core` depends on nothing but `tree-sitter`, so it can be embedded without pulling in
serde, the filesystem, or any grammar crate.

**The language seam is data plus two traits.** A `LanguageSpec` is a `&'static` value naming the
node kinds for each syntactic role and the field names the walker reads, plus
`&'static dyn Hooks` for the tree-reading that genuinely differs between languages (unit names,
callees, `unit_scope` for recursion, `if_parts` for if-chains). `LanguageDescriptor` is the
per-file-type trait (extensions, `extract`, `is_generated`, `unscored_suffixes`). Hooks read the
tree; the scoring arithmetic stays in core, so parity between languages is structural. A trait
method is required only when every language must answer it, and one added later ships with a
default that keeps today's behaviour; the `Hooks` doc example implements only the required
methods, so `cargo test -p bonsai-core --doc` fails if that rule is broken. That spec is
compiled once per process against a `tree_sitter::Language`, resolving every kind string to a
`u16` id and every field name to a `FieldId` into flat arrays — the walker indexes by
`node.kind_id()` rather than comparing strings, so adding languages doesn't cost anything at
scan time. Compilation is fallible on purpose: a grammar upgrade that renames a node fails spec
compilation with a message naming it, rather than silently scoring that construct as zero
forever.

**A language id is not a claim about languages.** Vue is a file format whose script blocks are
TypeScript, and `VUE_SPEC` is the TypeScript spec under another name, so the scores are identical.
It carries its own id because the id is what `--lang`, `--over LANG=N`, a `[section]` and the JSON
`language` field all key on, and a component deserves a budget separate from a service. Since
`registry::language_ids` deduplicates by `spec.id`, a distinct id is what forces a distinct spec.
The reasoning is in [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md); don't collapse the id without
reading it.

**Adding a language** means: a new crate with the grammar dependency, a `LanguageSpec`, and types
implementing `Hooks` and `LanguageDescriptor`; a fixture exercising every declared kind, wired
through `GrammarFixture::assert_contract()`; the scores pinned as `(snippet, total)` tables in
`tests/spec.rs`; and registering the descriptor in `bonsai-engine/src/registry.rs` behind a cargo
feature. The full checklist (`cli_<id>.rs`, wasm, extension) is in
[docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md); CI's feature powerset reads the manifest and the
CLI's `--lang` help reads the registry, so neither needs an edit. Most of the effort is the
fixture and score tables, not the spec itself. A grammar shape the defaults can't read is handled
by overriding that hook in the language's own crate, as Go overrides `if_parts` for its node-less
`else` and its `if` initializer. Java overrides `if_parts` for the same missing `else` node,
`unit_body` because `static { }` leaves its block unfielded, and `call_reaches_unit` because
overloads share a name. Python overrides `if_parts` because `elif` holds its branch in
`consequence`, `unit_body` so a body of only `...` is not a unit, and `is_control_header` because
`a if c else b` leaves its condition unfielded. Core charges an `else` that no if chain claims
+1, which only Python's loop and `try` else reach.

**`GrammarFixture::assert_contract()`** (`bonsai-testkit`) makes six assertions per language,
because an id-indexed table fails in ways a string match doesn't: the fixture parses cleanly; the
spec compiles against the grammar (resolves every kind/field); every declared kind is actually
produced by the fixture, not merely present in the grammar's symbol table; where a grammar
renamed a kind across releases and both spellings are declared, one is live; `id_for_node_kind`
agrees with `kind_id` for every declared kind (tree-sitter aliasing can otherwise make the whole
table miss silently); and for every `if`/else-if node, the language's own `if_parts` recognises
every part of the chain (no `IfPart::Unrecognised`).
When touching a `LanguageSpec` or bumping a `tree-sitter-*` grammar version, run this contract
first — it is designed to tell you exactly what broke.

**Scan driver invariants** (`bonsai-engine` + the CLI) — easy to break by accident, so preserve
them when touching scan/domain/path code:
- Every path compared against a domain root is canonicalized first, so `/tmp` vs `/private/tmp`
  never land on opposite sides of a `starts_with`.
- Globs stop `*` at `/` and let `**` cross it, matching `.gitignore` semantics; the domain walk
  depth is bounded by this, which keeps a per-keystroke editor scan cheap.
- Every thread that parses reserves a 256 MB stack (`bonsai_engine::STACK_SIZE`) because the
  walkers are recursive and generated code nests deeper than a default stack allows. `ignore`'s
  `build_parallel()` cannot host the scoring: it spawns visitors with `std::thread::scope` and
  no stack-size control. The one exception is a machine that grants no worker thread at all:
  the scan then runs inline on the caller's thread, which the engine did not size. The CLI is
  safe because `main` already wraps the run in a sized thread; an embedder must do the same.
- Worker count is capped by the file count and by four times `available_parallelism`. Past that
  the spawns cost more than the parallelism returns — uncapped, `--jobs 5000` measures slower
  than `--jobs 1`.
- The walk is planned on one thread, files are scored on many, results are replayed in plan
  order, walk errors keeping their slot beside the files.
- Two mechanisms make that deterministic and they cover different things. The report body is
  ordered by `rank` (a stable sort over score/path/line, path unique per file), and its only
  ties — two findings on one line — survive because each file's findings merge as one contiguous
  batch. Warnings and errors have no such sort: they accumulate in merge order alone. So a broken
  replay shows up on stderr, not in the report, and a test for it needs several invalid-UTF-8
  files, not one.
- A file its language marks as generated (`LanguageDescriptor::is_generated`: Go's
  `// Code generated … DO NOT EDIT.` header, or a Java or Python header comment saying both
  "generated" and "do not edit") is read, then dropped on the worker without being counted,
  like a `.min.js` the plan never admits; `--stdin` answers it with an empty report.
- Invalid UTF-8 is decoded leniently with a warning (replacement bytes land in strings/comments,
  which don't score); an unreadable file is a hard error and fails the run.
- A closed stdout ends output quietly and leaves the exit code to the scan's result, not to the
  write error.
- Only a scan that covers a baseline's whole domain judges it, never one with `--stdin`,
  `--domain` or `--lang`: a partial scan cannot tell a deleted unit from one it did not look at,
  and under `strict-baseline` its verdict would fail pre-commit hooks and editors.

**Naming the language set:** taglines and descriptions call the tool *multi-language* and never
enumerate languages. That covers the GitHub About text, the crate description (which npm,
Homebrew, PyPI and the Composer package reuse), the extension's `displayName` and `description`,
and the cover's alt text.

The supported languages are enumerated in exactly two places, the README intro and its
supported-languages table. Both are ordered by usage rather than by when support landed:
JavaScript, TypeScript, Vue, Python, Java, PHP, Go. That is the Stack Overflow developer survey
order, ranking a family by its most-used member: Vue sits beside TypeScript because it is scored
as TypeScript, and Python follows that family. A new language is slotted in by the same
ranking, and `docs/scoring-rules.md` orders its per-language tables and sections the same way.

Everything else that names languages is functional and follows the registry:
- the cargo features, which CI's feature powerset reads;
- the extension's activation events and its default `bonsai-lint.languages`;
- the pre-commit hook's `files` pattern, which a test derives from the registry;
- the search tags: GitHub topics, the extension's `keywords`, and the crate's `keywords`, which
  PyPI reuses and the Composer package extends with `static analysis` and `dev`, the tags that
  make `composer require` offer `--dev`.

**Naming convention:** every user-facing name is `bonsai-lint` — crate, binary, `bonsai-lint.toml`,
`.bonsai-lint-baseline.json`, the `bonsai-lint-ignore` marker, the extension's `bonsai-lint.*`
settings. The bare `bonsai` namespace deliberately isn't claimed anywhere (it belongs to unrelated
projects on crates.io/npm/PyPI/VS Code Marketplace).

## Testing conventions

- `bonsai-lang-php` and `bonsai-lang-ts` each have `tests/grammar.rs` (the contract, via
  `bonsai-testkit`), plus `naming.rs`, `spec.rs`, `suppression.rs`, `toplevel.rs`, and for TS,
  `tsx.rs`. Fixtures live in `tests/fixtures/`, shared helpers in `tests/common/mod.rs`.
- `bonsai-lang-go` has the same five suites plus `generated.rs` (the generated-file header rule).
  Its `common::findings` also rejects a snippet that does not parse cleanly, since Go syntax is
  easy to get subtly wrong inside a string.
- `bonsai-lang-java` has the same suites as Go, `generated.rs` included, and the same
  parse-clean check. Its second helper, `findings_in_a_grammar_gap`, insists the snippet does
  *not* parse cleanly. It pins the workaround for syntax tree-sitter-java cannot read yet, such
  as `String @Nullable ... args`, and fails once a grammar upgrade learns it.
- `bonsai-lang-python` has the same suites as Go, `generated.rs` included, and the same
  parse-clean check, since indentation is easy to get wrong inside a Rust string. Its
  `common::score` wraps a flush-left snippet in `def target():` and indents every line, so the
  score tables stay readable.
- `bonsai-lang-vue` reuses the TypeScript spec under a second id, so it has no naming or scoring
  suite of its own. It has `grammar.rs` (the spec against both TS grammars), `host_grammar.rs`
  (the HTML grammar's kinds, which nothing else would fail on), `sfc.rs` (block extraction) and
  `vue.rs` (scoring, and that a reported line is a line in the `.vue` file).
- `bonsai-engine` integration tests (`baseline.rs`, `config.rs`, `scan.rs`) exercise config
  discovery, domains, baseline read/write and which entries the code has outgrown, against real
  temp directories.
- `bonsai-lint/tests/` drives the compiled binary end-to-end, split by area (`cli_report.rs`,
  `cli_stdin.rs`, `cli_baseline.rs`, `cli_domains.rs`, `cli_parallel.rs`, `cli_vue.rs`,
  `cli_go.rs`, `cli_java.rs`, `cli_python.rs`, `cli_pre_commit.rs`, `cli_github.rs`) over a
  shared `tests/common/mod.rs`. Each file is its own test binary, so `--test cli_vue` runs in a
  fifth of a second while `cli_parallel` is the slow one. `cli_pre_commit.rs` reads the hook's
  arguments from `.pre-commit-hooks.yaml`, so it runs exactly the command users get.
- `pypi/test_build_wheels.py` builds wheels from dist-shaped archives holding synthetic ELF,
  Mach-O and PE headers, against the real v0.4.1 `dist-manifest.json` in `pypi/testdata/`. It
  covers every refusal and asserts the gnu builds stay out, which is a rule by omission.
- Cross-language parity (the same logic scoring identically in every language) is a tested
  property, not an assumption — see the README's "same code scores the same" example when
  changing shared scoring logic in `bonsai-core`.
- `bonsai-core` has no grammar, so the language crates test its behaviour. Its one suite,
  `tests/kind_sets.rs`, checks that `KindSets::all` yields every list, because two of the
  contract's checks see only the kinds it yields. PHP's `grammar.rs` also proves that a spec its
  grammar no longer matches fails to compile, and that the error names what to fix.

Mutation testing runs on demand, never in CI. On 2026-09-27, `bonsai-core`'s 237 mutants took
26 minutes with four jobs on a 10-core machine, which would take hours on a CI runner, and the
whole workspace has 1112. Run it after changing scoring logic in `bonsai-core`, or over just the
lines a branch changed:

```bash
cargo install --locked cargo-mutants
cargo mutants --package bonsai-core --test-workspace true --all-features -j 4 --timeout 120
git diff origin/main > /tmp/branch.diff
cargo mutants --workspace --in-diff /tmp/branch.diff --test-workspace true --all-features -j 4 --timeout 120
```

- **`--test-workspace true`:** `bonsai-core` is tested from the language crates, so without it
  every mutant there survives.
- **`--timeout 120`:** the unmutated baseline runs only the package's own tests, which sets the
  automatic timeout to its 20-second floor, below a full workspace run.
- **A surviving mutant is a question, not a missing test.** Of that run's 22 survivors, 11 changed
  nothing observable: trait defaults every language overrides, equivalent bit operations, a
  `Debug` implementation and a branch no language reaches. The other 11 were real gaps, now
  tested.

## Comments

Don't comment. The exception is a short "why" — rationale, a trade-off, the reason a non-obvious
choice was made — and only where it is genuinely needed. Three lines is the ceiling; one is
usually right.

Never restate what the code already says. If a comment could be deleted without losing something
a reader could not recover from the code itself, delete it. Where a rule is correct *by omission*
— a value deliberately absent from a match arm or a list — pair the "why" with a named test
asserting the absence, since a comment alone cannot fail.

**Public API docs are the other exception.** Every crate is published, and docs.rs shows its
`///` and `//!` docs to embedders who never open the source, so each public item says what it is
for. `missing_docs` requires one on every public item, every crate and every integration test
file. Clippy's `too_long_first_doc_paragraph` fails a first paragraph over 200 characters.
- **The first paragraph is one sentence** saying what the item is, since docs.rs lists it beside
  the name.
- **The rest adds what the signature can't say:** a unit, a range, what `None` means, where a
  value comes from, and the "why". No lint limits its length, so the rules above still hold: never
  restate the name or the type.
- **Private items keep the "why"-only rule,** whether it is written with `//` or `///`.

## Workspace-wide lint config (`Cargo.toml`)

`unsafe_code = "forbid"`, clippy `pedantic` warn, and `excessive_nesting`/`too_many_lines` are
**deny**, not warn (nesting threshold is 3, set in `clippy.toml`). This is a deliberate
dogfooding stance — the tool measures complexity/nesting in the languages it lints, and enforces
a version of the same discipline on its own Rust via clippy. Don't loosen these to get code to
compile; restructure instead.

A set of allow-by-default `rustc` lints, clippy's `cargo` group, and hand-picked clippy
`restriction` and `nursery` lints are warn too. Each was clean when it was added, so a hit is new
code to fix, not a lint to switch off. Neither `restriction` nor `nursery` is a group to enable
wholesale: `restriction`'s lints contradict each other, and `nursery`'s are unsettled. An
`#[allow]` needs a `reason = "…"`, the same "why" a comment would give.

## Releasing

Releases go through [`cargo-dist`](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist): pushing a `v*` tag
builds every target and publishes a GitHub Release, npm package, Homebrew formula, Go module,
Composer package and PyPI wheels.
`.github/workflows/release.yml` is generated from `dist-workspace.toml` — edit the latter and run
`dist generate`, don't hand-edit the workflow. `dist plan` previews a release. The VS Code
extension version is independent of the CLI's and is published manually via `vsce` (needs an
Azure DevOps PAT).

Upgrading dist takes two more steps:
- **Re-pin its actions.** They are pinned in `[dist.github-action-commits]`, so point them at the
  commits behind the tags the new version uses.
- **Review `.github/zizmor.yml` again.** Its exceptions name `release.yml`'s findings by line and
  column, so the Workflow security job fails until they match the regenerated file.
  `zizmor --no-config .github/workflows/release.yml` lists the findings with their new positions.

`CHANGELOG.md` is not decoration: `dist` reads the section whose heading matches the tag and
publishes it as that release's notes, so a missing or misnamed section ships an empty release
page. Add the section before tagging, and keep the heading as `## [x.y.z] - YYYY-MM-DD`.

The version is `version` in the root `Cargo.toml` **and** the internal path dependencies beside
it, which must match or cargo refuses to build. The npm package, Homebrew formula, Go module,
Composer package, PyPI wheels and the pre-commit hook's `setup.py` take their version from that one
field; none is edited by hand. The extension is bumped afterwards, because its lockfile can only pin a CLI
version that is already published.

**The version moves when compatibility does.** A pull request that breaks a library crate's
public API bumps the workspace to the next breaking version (0.3.x → 0.4.0) in the same change.
CI's required **Public API** job (`cargo-semver-checks` against the latest release on crates.io)
fails until it does. A release that follows only compatible changes bumps the patch version in
the release PR. A crate that has never been published is left out until its first release.

crates.io is published separately, by dispatching `.github/workflows/publish-crates.yml` by hand
after the release, because a published version can never be taken back:
- **Normally it uses trusted publishing.** GitHub vouches for the run, and crates.io issues a token
  that lasts 30 minutes, then revokes it when the job ends. Each crate's crates.io settings name
  that workflow as a trusted publisher (owner `ryckakas`, repository `bonsai-lint`, workflow
  `publish-crates.yml`).
- **A release that adds a new crate, such as a language, sets `first_publish`.** crates.io trusts a
  workflow only for a crate that already exists there, so the new crate is created with the
  `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` secret. Every other crate still goes through trusted publishing, which is
  all they accept, so the workflow publishes in dependency order and switches credentials between
  runs. Without `first_publish` it refuses to create a crate. Create a short-lived token for it,
  add the new crate's trusted publisher once it is up, then delete the secret.
- **A version already on crates.io is skipped,** so a publish that failed partway is rerun as it
  was and sends only what is missing.
- **Run with `dry_run` first.** It packages and verifies every crate, uploads nothing, needs no
  token, and prints which credential each crate would use.

The Go module `bonsai.kauneckas.dev/bonsai-lint` and the Composer package `bonsai-lint/bonsai-lint`
are launchers that live together in
[bonsai-lint-launcher](https://github.com/ryckakas/bonsai-lint-launcher), and one tag publishes
both. `.github/workflows/publish-launcher.yml` is a custom dist publish job, and it runs once the
GitHub Release exists:
- **What it does:**
  - it writes that repository's `release.go` and `composer/src/Release.php` from the released
    `dist-manifest.json`;
  - it checks only what the generated files can change: they build (`go vet`, `php -l`), both name
    the same release (the guard test), `composer.json` validates and still carries the crate's
    description, license and keywords. The launchers' full suites already passed as the launcher
    repository's required checks on that commit, and rerunning them could only add flakiness;
  - it runs both launchers against the real release, retrying a network failure twice;
  - it writes that repository's `README.md` as this repository's README at the release, with its
    relative links pointed back here, because Packagist shows the launcher repository's README;
  - only then does it push the tag `vX.Y.Z`, whose commit carries all three files;
  - last, it opens a pull request bringing `main` the same `README.md`, which merges itself once
    the launcher repository's required checks pass. Packagist refreshes the page on that push.
    The step may fail without failing the release, and says so.
  - The release commit hangs off `main` and only the tag reaches the remote, so `main` keeps both
    placeholders. `main` ships as it stands at that moment, so land launcher changes there only
    when they are ready.
- **What it needs:**
  - a `GO_MODULE_TOKEN` secret with contents write access to bonsai-lint-launcher, which was
    renamed from bonsai-lint-go. The secret becomes `LAUNCHER_TOKEN` at the token's next rotation.
    bonsai-lint-launcher's `main` takes pull requests only, while its tags must stay unprotected
    for the job to push;
  - the page behind `https://bonsai.kauneckas.dev/bonsai-lint?go-get=1`, served from
    bonsai-lint-site, through which the Go proxy resolves the import path;
  - Packagist's GitHub hook on bonsai-lint-launcher, which lists each tag as it is pushed;
  - for the README pull request, the token's Pull requests write access and auto-merge allowed
    in bonsai-lint-launcher's settings.
- **Edit the README here, never there.** bonsai-lint-launcher's `README.md` is generated by its
  `internal/readme`, and its `LAUNCHERS.md` documents the launchers themselves.
- **A published version is permanent in both.** A failed publish is rerun with `workflow_dispatch`,
  `rehearsal` unticked. That is a no-op when the tag already exists with the same release files,
  and it fails when they differ, because a tag is never moved. A broken Go version is retracted
  from the next patch release's `go.mod`; a broken Composer version is superseded by the next
  patch.
- **The two release files cannot drift apart.** The launcher repo's
  `TestTheComposerReleaseMatchesTheGoRelease` requires both to name the same release, so a job
  that writes only `release.go` fails its own tests and tags nothing.
- **Rehearse a launcher change** with `workflow_dispatch` and `rehearsal` ticked. It runs every
  step, the real downloads included, but pushes `refs/rehearsal/<tag>` instead of tagging, and
  never contacts the proxy. That ref is outside `refs/heads`, so Packagist never lists it as a
  branch.
- **After each tag,** the launcher repo's `published.yml` installs the new version the way users
  do: through the Go proxy and through Packagist, on Linux, macOS, Windows and Alpine.

PyPI gets five wheels per release, which `pypi/build_wheels.py` builds from the released archives,
each carrying the Release's binary byte for byte. Two workflows publish them, because PyPI trusts
only a top-level run, and dist calls its custom jobs as reusable workflows:
- **What runs:** dist's `custom-dispatch-pypi` job (`dispatch-pypi.yml`) dispatches
  `publish-pypi.yml` at the tag and waits for it, so a failed upload fails the Release run.
  `publish-pypi.yml` builds and checks the wheels, pip-installs them on Linux, macOS and Windows,
  and uploads from the `pypi` environment, with attestations.
- **What it needs:** no secret. PyPI's trusted publisher for `bonsai-lint` names owner `ryckakas`,
  repository `bonsai-lint`, workflow `publish-pypi.yml` and environment `pypi`, which GitHub
  admits only from `v*` tags. TestPyPI's names environment `testpypi`, admitted from `main`. A
  project's first upload goes through a pending publisher, which expires after 30 days and
  reserves nothing, so it is registered close to that release.
- **A published file is permanent.** A failed publish is rerun with
  `gh workflow run publish-pypi.yml --ref vX.Y.Z -f tag=vX.Y.Z -f target=pypi`, which sends only
  what is missing, within 14 days of the first upload; after that PyPI refuses new files for the
  release. The dispatch runs `publish-pypi.yml` as it stands at the tag, so a bug in it cannot be
  fixed for that tag: the version skips PyPI and the next patch release carries the fix. A broken
  release is yanked whole.
- **Rehearse a pipeline change** by dispatching `dispatch-pypi.yml` from `main` with a released
  tag. It publishes `<version>.dev<run>` to TestPyPI through the same dispatch and watch.

The pre-commit hook has no publish step of its own: the tag is its release, and pre-commit pulls
the wheel from PyPI, so for the few minutes before the upload lands, that rev fails to install.
- **Only `vX.Y.Z` tags may be reachable from `main`.** `pre-commit autoupdate` moves every user to
  the nearest tag on `main`, so a stray tag, or a prerelease whose wheel never reaches PyPI,
  would break their installs. Two tag rulesets refuse to create anything but a `v*` tag, and any
  `v*-*` tag. A prerelease, if one is ever needed, is tagged on a branch `main` never merges.
- **The hook id `bonsai-lint` is a contract.** autoupdate refuses a rev that lacks a configured
  id, so the id is never renamed or removed, and `cli_pre_commit.rs` asserts it.
