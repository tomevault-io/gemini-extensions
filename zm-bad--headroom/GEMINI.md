# AGENTS.md

Project instructions for AI coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, Windsurf, etc.) working in this repository.

> **Single source of truth — edit `AGENTS.md`, not `CLAUDE.md`.** `CLAUDE.md` is a symlink to this file (`AGENTS.md`). This is deliberate: `AGENTS.md` is the cross-agent standard filename (Cursor / Copilot / Windsurf read it), while Claude Code reads `CLAUDE.md` — the symlink serves both from one source. Most editors and tools (including the Edit tool) **reject writing through a symlink** ("Refusing to write through symlink"), so always open and edit `AGENTS.md` directly. Do **not** replace the symlink with a real file, delete it, or duplicate the content into `CLAUDE.md`.

## Project Overview

Headroom is a browser extension built with [WXT](https://wxt.dev/) (next-gen web extension framework). **Manifest V3 only** — Chrome, Edge, and Firefox. MV2 is not supported (`manifestVersion: 3` is set in `wxt.config.ts`, overriding WXT's Firefox-default MV2).

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev              # Dev + HMR → .output/chrome-mv3-dev/ (DIFFERENT dir from build!)
npm run dev:firefox      # Dev mode for Firefox
npm run build            # Production build → .output/chrome-mv3/
npm run build:chrome     # Same as build (alias)
npm run build:firefox    # Production build → .output/firefox-mv3/
npm run build:edge       # Production build → .output/edge-mv3/
npm run zip              # Package .zip for distribution (Chrome)
npm run zip:firefox      # Package .zip for Firefox
npm run zip:edge         # Package .zip for Edge
npm run lint             # ESLint check
npm run lint:fix         # ESLint auto-fix
npm run typecheck        # TypeScript type check (tsc --noEmit)
npm test                 # Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:run         # Run tests once (CI + pre-commit)
npx wxt prepare          # Regenerate types in .wxt/ (auto-runs on postinstall)
```

## Architecture

**WXT uses file-based routing** — entrypoints are auto-discovered from `entrypoints/` directory.

- **HTML entrypoints** must use directory structure: `entrypoints/<name>/index.html` + `entrypoints/<name>/main.ts`. Do NOT place `.html` and `.ts` sibling files with the same name — WXT treats them as duplicate entrypoints.
- **Script entrypoints**: `background.ts` uses `export default defineBackground(() => {...})`. Content scripts use `export default defineContentScript({ matches: [...], main() {...} })`.
- **Auto-imports**: `defineBackground`, `defineContentScript`, `defineConfig`, `browser` etc. are auto-imported by WXT. Do not add explicit import statements for these.
- **Cross-browser API**: Use `browser.*` (WXT wrapper) instead of `chrome.*` directly.

### Upstash (Redis) data model — the cloud storage layer

Upstash Redis (user-owned, BYOK) is the **cross-device merge point + cloud persistence**; `browser.storage.local` is the acceleration cache the live gauge reads from. The **token truth is the platform's conversation-history text** — tokens are always _estimated_ from that text by the 001 engine, never trusted from the platform; Upstash only persists the resulting counts. The transport layer is spec [002](specs/002-upstash-data-layer.md); the reconciliation that reads/writes these records (open = full recompute, union-merge by round-n, delete sync, zombie cleanup) is spec [003](specs/003-cross-device-sync.md). The extension reaches Upstash only over the HTTPS **REST API** — the browser can't speak native Redis.

**REST contract** (`utils/upstash.ts`): one HTTPS POST per command.
`POST {UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL}/` · header `Authorization: Bearer {UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN}` · body = JSON command array (`["GET",key]` / `["SET",key,val]` / `["DEL",key]`) → `{ "result": <string|null> }`. 8s `AbortController` timeout — a wedged Upstash must not hang the SW. Empty creds ⇒ every op silently no-ops (Upstash is optional; the gauge works off local state).

**Free-tier budget** ([pricing](https://upstash.com/pricing/redis)): 256 MB storage, **500K commands/month** (account-level, not per-key). Each round costs 2 commands (GET + SET in the read-modify-write), a delete costs 1 (DEL), a settings save costs 1, a side-panel open costs 1 (settings-pull GET, spec 003). 500K/month ≈ 250K rounds/month — well beyond a single user. Storage is a non-issue: a `DialogueRecord` stores **only token counts** per round (no prompt/answer text — see `utils/dialogue-record.ts`), so a 50-round conversation is ~4 KB; 256 MB ≈ 65K conversations. **Architectural implication**: 003's zombie-cleanup / open-reconcile can burst commands after a long offline period (there is **no outbox** — missed rounds are simply re-reconciled on next open), but the total stays within budget because they are real user activity that would have been counted anyway. If a user ever exceeds the free tier, Upstash bills ~$0.20/100K extra commands — that's the user's account, not Headroom's concern.

**Key scheme — only two value types live on Redis:**

- `headroom:conv:{platform}:{dialogueId}` → `DialogueRecord` JSON (shape in `utils/dialogue-record.ts`; carries `updatedAt`).
- `headroom:settings` → `{ thresholds, language, contextLimits, tokenCoefficients, updatedAt }`. **Credentials are NEVER written here** — you can't read Redis without them, so storing them is both pointless and a leak. Local `Settings` keeps the full object (creds included); the cloud keeps only this stripped shape (`utils/cloud-settings.ts`).

**Client layering — keep it this way:** generic primitives `kvGet` / `kvSet` / `kvDel` (shape-agnostic transport) under one typed wrapper per domain value (`getDialogue`/`setDialogue`/`delDialogue`, `getCloudSettings`/`setCloudSettings`/`delCloudSettings`). A new Redis value type = a new thin wrapper over the kv primitives, **not** a fourth fetch path.

**Credentials stay local.** The extension reads them from local `Settings.upstash`; the debug probe reads `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` / `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` from `.env` (gitignored).

**Verify after any change here:** `node scripts/probe-upstash.mjs` — reads `.env`, runs GET/SET/DEL × (conv + settings) against the **live** instance on throwaway `headroom:_probe:*` keys (self-cleans in `finally`), and asserts no credentials leak into the stored settings JSON. Not part of `npm test`.

## Key Files

- `wxt.config.ts` — WXT config + manifest overrides
- `tsconfig.json` — extends `.wxt/tsconfig.json` (generated by `wxt prepare`)
- `eslint.config.js` — ESLint flat config (TS + auto-imports aware)
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — GitHub Actions: lint + typecheck + build
- `.husky/pre-commit` — lint-staged → `npm run lint` → `npm run typecheck` → `npm run test:run` → `npm run build` → `npm run build:firefox`
- `brand/` — Headroom logo source SVGs (`blue.svg` main, `white.svg` light-bg, `gray.svg` disabled state); rendered to toolbar PNGs via `scripts/generate-icons.mjs`
- `icon/` — per-platform brand SVGs (7 files, one per AI platform); imported by the sidepanel at build time
- `public/icon/` — extension toolbar icons (PNGs rendered from `brand/blue.svg` + `brand/gray.svg` via `scripts/generate-icons.mjs`)
- `public/_locales/` — i18n message catalogs (en + zh_CN complete; 8 other locales fall back to en for new keys)
- `.wxt/` — generated types, do not edit manually
- `.output/` — build output, gitignored

### i18n system

The sidepanel uses a two-layer translator (`t()` in `main.ts`):

1. Manual override layer — `localeTables[selectedLang]`, loaded at init from the 10 `_locales/*/messages.json` files
2. Browser-native layer — `browser.i18n.getMessage(key)`, used in "auto" mode

When a key is missing in the selected locale, `t()` explicitly falls back to `localeTables["en"]` — NOT to `browser.i18n.getMessage(key)`. The browser API uses the **browser's UI language**, which can be a third language (e.g. browser is zh_CN, user selected Deutsch). Explicit en fallback ensures untranslated keys always show English, not whatever the browser happens to speak.

New keys only need to be added to `en/messages.json` and `zh_CN/messages.json`; the other 8 locales inherit English via the fallback chain. See `sidepanel/main.ts` → `t()` for the implementation.

### Token estimation engine (spec 004)

Six writing systems, each with an independent coefficient:

| Script                   | Counting unit |
| ------------------------ | ------------- |
| CJK (中日韩统一表意文字) | per character |
| Kana (仮名)              | per character |
| Hangul (한글)            | per character |
| Cyrillic                 | per word      |
| Arabic                   | per word      |
| Latin (fallback)         | per word      |

Char-based scripts are NOT double-counted as words. Coefficients are user-overridable per platform in the Advanced Settings panel. The engine lives in `utils/estimate.ts`; coefficients flow through `Settings.tokenCoefficients` → Upstash cloud sync.

**Coefficient values are measured, never guessed.** Per-platform defaults live in each adapter's `tokenCoefficients`; the calibrated matrix + method are in spec 004 §4.3–4.4. To re-calibrate (e.g. after a platform swaps models): `npm i --no-save tiktoken @huggingface/transformers`, then `node --experimental-strip-types scripts/calibrate-chatgpt.mjs` and `scripts/calibrate-hf.mjs`. **Landmine (2026-07):** the BPE-era rule of thumb "1 Chinese char ≈ 1.5–2.5 tokens" is wrong for modern 129K–262K vocabs — measured CJK is 0.58–0.83 tok/char (multi-char words pack into single tokens). An "informed estimate" shipped as calibration overestimated CJK 2–3×; only an actual tokenizer run counts as calibration.

### Adapter zero-coupling rule ⚠️

**A platform bug fix MUST NOT change the behaviour of any other platform. Zero exceptions.**

The `background.ts` and `platform.content.ts` pipelines are generic engines over `PlatformAdapter` — they route all 7 platforms through the same code. A bug that only affects one platform (e.g. ChatGPT) must be fixed **in the adapter layer** (`adapters/chatgpt.ts` or the `PlatformAdapter` interface), never by changing the shared pipeline for everyone.

| ❌ Wrong                                                                       | ✅ Right                                                                                               |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `if (d.method !== "POST") return` in background.ts to fix ChatGPT              | Add `completionMethod?: string` to the adapter interface, let ChatGPT's adapter declare its constraint |
| Run DOM-based answer-count polling for all platforms to fix Gemini             | Add `needsDomPollDetection?: boolean` to the adapter interface, only Gemini sets it to `true`          |
| Change `completionUrl` pattern for one platform in the shared URL_FILTER logic | Each adapter's `completionUrl` is its own — if one is wrong, fix it in that adapter file               |

**Why this matters.** These 7 AI platforms are independent products from different companies — DeepSeek, OpenAI, Google, Moonshot, Alibaba, ByteDance. They change their APIs on their own schedules, with zero coordination. What's true for all of them today (e.g. "all completion endpoints use POST") may not be true for one of them tomorrow. The adapter is the abstraction boundary that isolates that volatility.

When you need platform-specific behaviour:

1. Add an **optional** field to `PlatformAdapter` in `utils/platform-adapter.ts` (with a sensible default)
2. Set it on the adapter(s) that need the non-default value
3. Read it in the pipeline code: `adapter.<field> ?? <default>`

### Adding a new platform

1. Create `adapters/<platform>.ts` implementing `PlatformAdapter` (see `utils/platform-adapter.ts`)
2. Register in `adapters/index.ts` → `ADAPTERS` array
3. Add SVG brand icon to `icon/<platform>.svg` (and `PLATFORM_ICON` map in `sidepanel/main.ts`)
4. Add entry to `PLATFORM_REF` array in `sidepanel/main.ts` for the Platform Reference section
5. Add `host_permissions` entry in `wxt.config.ts`
6. Run `npx wxt prepare` to refresh types
7. If no SVG exists, `brand/blue.svg` (the Headroom gauge) is used automatically via `PLATFORM_ICON[platformId] ?? defaultIcon`

## Commit Messages

Conventional Commits format, enforced by commitlint (`.husky/commit-msg` + CI).

**Format:** `<type>(<scope>): <subject>` — imperative, ≤50 chars, no period. Blank line, then body (WHY + landmines only, never restate the diff; ≤72 chars/line), then `Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>` (required for every AI commit).

**Types:** `feat` `fix` `docs` `refactor` `perf` `test` `build` `ci` `chore` `style`. Scope is the affected module (e.g. `sidepanel` `background` `upstash`).

**Squash:** dev churn gets squashed, but landmine lessons must survive — keep the commit or move the lesson into a code comment / this playbook.

## Spec-Driven Development

Specs are PRDs optimized for AI agents — more precise, less ambiguous, more actionable.

**Pipeline: `requirements/` → `specs/xxx.md` → code**

### Division of labor

| Stage                        | Owner     | Action                                           |
| ---------------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `requirements/` (gitignored) | **Human** | Write product requirements, discussion, analysis |
| `specs/xxx.md`               | **AI**    | Read requirements, generate spec from template   |
| Spec review                  | **Human** | Review and commit to main (commit = approved)    |
| Write code                   | **AI**    | Implement based on spec                          |

### Rules

- **No spec, no code.** Never implement without a committed spec in `specs/`.
- **Spec = single source of current truth.** Edit it in place as decisions evolve. When a decision changes, fix the original text — no strikethrough, no appended "we changed it" note. Git is the history; the spec reflects only the present.
- **Never append redundant Implementation Notes.** What code/git already shows (data model, UI inventory, key counts, "build is green") does not go in the spec — it's noise that costs every future AI reader input tokens. Reserve spec edits for what code+git can't recover (decisions, rationale, landmines, deferred scope), and keep them terse, folded into the relevant section — not an appendix.
- When a new requirement appears in `requirements/`, offer to generate a corresponding spec.
- Use `specs/000-spec-template.md` as the template for new specs.

## Development & Debugging Playbook

Lessons learned building Headroom. Stack-specific (WXT + MV3 extension), not generic advice. Read before starting a change.

### The loop (agreed)

**AI:** edit → `npm run typecheck` → `npm run lint` → `npm run build` → say "ready".
**Human:** `chrome://extensions` → 🔄 reload → test in browser → report back.

Don't run `npm run dev` in the background (stdin EOF kills it). Don't try to auto-launch Chrome — CDP is flaky on macOS. Default to `build` + manual reload.

### Do

- After every change: `typecheck` → `lint` → `build`. `wxt build` does NOT type-check.
- `dev` and `build` output to DIFFERENT dirs (`-dev` vs `-mv3`). Rebuild the one the human loaded.
- After adding a new entrypoint: `npx wxt prepare`.
- Verify config field names against WXT types (it's `webExt`, not `webExtConfig`).

### Don't

- Don't add explicit imports for WXT auto-imports. "Cannot find name" before `wxt prepare` is normal.
- Don't Remove + re-Load-unpacked after a rebuild — just 🔄 reload (ID is path-derived, stable).
- Don't claim a feature works without evidence. State what you verified vs. what's pending human test.
- Don't try to auto-drive Chrome for runtime verification. Defer to the human.

### Verify

- `typecheck` + `lint` pass, build succeeds, manifest has expected permissions.
- Grep **string literals** in build artifacts (IDs, permission names) to confirm code landed — they survive minification; function names don't (esbuild mangles them).
- After Upstash changes: `node scripts/probe-upstash.mjs` (live probe, self-cleans). Not part of `npm test`.

### WXT gotchas

- **Two output dirs** (see above).
- **Auto-imports** resolve only after `wxt prepare`; pre-prepare "Cannot find name" is normal.
- **`browser.i18n.getMessage` / `browser.runtime.getURL` are typed to literal unions** (message names / `PublicPath`), so passing a runtime `string` needs a `as (name: string) => string` alias (see `main.ts`) — not a real error.
- **"Don't auto-open a browser in dev"** = `webExt: { disabled: true }` in `wxt.config.ts`.
- **`defineBackground`'s callback can't be async** — fire async helpers with `void fn()`.

### MV3 extension gotchas

- **Side panel on click needs the popup removed.** `action.default_popup` intercepts the toolbar click so the panel never opens. Click handling is manual: `setPanelBehavior({ openPanelOnActionClick: false })` + `action.onClicked` listener → `sidePanel.open()` (on whitelisted tabs) or silent `return` (non-whitelisted). Guard `browser.sidePanel` (absent on Firefox → `sidebarAction`).
- **`action.disable()` icon graying is broken in MV3 — the 3-D ACL landmine (2026-07).** This problem consumed dozens of debugging rounds, 5 AI platforms consulted, and every plausible fix tried (per-tab disable, global disable, `declarativeContent`, raw `chrome.action`, icon swapping, grayscale PNG generation). **Root cause:** `sidePanel.setPanelBehavior({ openPanelOnActionClick: true })` binds the action click as a system-level behavior whose UI priority _exceeds_ `action.disable()`'s visual state — Chrome internally locks the icon active when a sidePanel is configured, and `disable()` only suppresses `onClicked` (logical), never the icon color (visual). **Chrome official stance (2026):** "Works As Intended" — Chromium issue 41419485 exists but is not marked as a bug; the MV3 migration guide explicitly notes `action` API doesn't provide `hide()`/`show()` like MV2's `pageAction` did. **Community consensus (Stack Overflow, Reddit, Mozilla Discourse):** this is a "民间偏方治好了官方绝症" situation — every mature sidePanel extension (Audio-Only YouTube, etc.) uses the same workaround because there is no official fix and none is coming. **The workaround (3-dimensional per-tab ACL):** (1) Visual — `action.setIcon({ tabId, path: COLOR/GRAY })` switches between two PNG icon sets; (2) Behavioral — `action.onClicked` intercepts clicks: whitelisted → `sidePanel.open()`, else `return` (simulates "not clickable"); (3) Availability — `sidePanel.setOptions({ tabId, enabled: true/false })` disables the panel per-tab. Default manifest icons are GRAY (prevents install flash). `action.enable()`/`disable()` are completely abandoned — they have no role in this scheme. Gray icons are generated from `brand/blue.svg` via a luminance-preserving grayscale conversion (not a simple desaturate — the gradient contrast is preserved so the gray bars remain distinguishable). See `scripts/generate-icons.mjs` for the rendering pipeline.
- **Firefox `sidebarAction.close()` requires user gesture — sidebar cannot be programmatically closed (2026-07).** Unlike Chrome/Edge `sidePanel.close()` which works anywhere, Firefox's `sidebarAction.close()`/`open()`/`toggle()` all require a user gesture (user input handler). Tab switch (`tabs.onActivated`) is NOT a user gesture. This is hardcoded in Firefox's C++ layer (Bug 1453355). All four AI platforms (Kimi, DeepSeek, Qwen, Gemini) + Bugzilla + MDN cross-verified: no workaround exists. The only viable path is `sidebarAction.setPanel()` to switch sidebar content on tab change (gauge page on AI platforms, "not supported" hint page elsewhere). **Do not attempt to call `sidebarAction.close()` from `onActivated` or `onUpdated` — it will always reject.**
- **Edge `sidePanel` does not auto-restore on tab switch back — platform limitation, not fixable (2026-07).** When `sidePanel.setOptions({ tabId, enabled: true })` is called on `tabs.onActivated`, Chrome auto-restores the panel if it was previously open; Edge does not. Microsoft confirmed "by design" ([issue #222](https://github.com/microsoft/MicrosoftEdge-Extensions/issues/222), open since Nov 2024, zero updates). `sidePanel.open()` requires a user gesture and can't be called from `onActivated` or `onUpdated`. Global sidePanel (no `tabId`) keeps the panel visible on ALL pages including non-platform, which breaks the UX requirement. **Do not attempt to "fix" this** — there are only two acceptable paths: (1) accept manual click to reopen on Edge, or (2) make the panel always visible and show a "not supported" message on non-platform pages.
- **Adding a manifest permission** (e.g. `storage`): reload usually applies it silently for unpacked extensions, but Chrome _may_ gray the card out pending consent — flag it when you add one.
- **Coupled range sliders:** a thumb sits at `(value-min)/(max-min)`, so changing a slider's `min`/`max` rescales its track and shifts the thumb even with the same value. Keep both `min`/`max` fixed and clamp only the dragged slider's value — never touch the other's bounds or value.
- **MV3 service worker is ephemeral:** keep state in `browser.storage`, not module globals; message handlers must assume a cold start.
- **Content-script long-lived timers must bind to the WXT context (`ctx.setInterval`), not `window.setInterval`.** When the extension is reloaded/updated the OLD content script's context is invalidated, but a raw `window.setInterval` keeps firing on the dead context — `browser.runtime.sendMessage` then throws _synchronously_ (`Uncaught Error: Extension context invalidated`; the returned promise's `.catch` never runs, because the throw happens before the promise exists) and floods the Errors log every tick. `ctx.setInterval` (the `ContentScriptContext` passed to `main(ctx)`) auto-clears on invalidation. Also wrap any `browser.runtime` call in `try/catch` (not just `.catch`) for in-flight races. Note: `"Extension context invalidated"` is the canonical MV3 dev-reload artifact (even Bitwarden / React DevTools hit it) — expected whenever you reload the extension, and the operational fix is to **reload the page after reloading the extension** (reload-extension ≠ re-inject content scripts in open tabs).
- **Reading a request body: don't patch `window.fetch` in a MAIN-world content script — use `webRequest`.** Real sites' bundles / analytics SDKs (e.g. DeepSeek's ByteDance Rangers) re-wrap `window.fetch` after your `document_start` script, clobbering your override before the request you care about fires — your wrapper is installed but silently never sees the request (confirmed via DevTools: `[Headroom-MAIN] interceptor installed` logged, but no interception log on send). `webRequest.onBeforeRequest` with `["requestBody"]` observes at the network layer regardless of fetch/XHR/worker or who re-wrapped fetch; needs the `webRequest` permission + a `host_permissions` entry (which may gray the unpacked card pending re-grant).

### Performance gotchas

- **`estimateTokens` — single-pass only; never `[...tok]` on untokenized text.** The 6-way estimator originally scanned text twice: Pass 1 per-character for CJK/kana/Hangul, then Pass 2 `split(/\s+/)` + `[...tok]` per-word for Cyrillic/Arabic/Latin. Chinese has no whitespace delimiters, so `split` yielded one giant token and `[...tok]` allocated an array of every single character — a GC bomb on 50+ round conversations. Keep it single-pass: one iteration counts char-based scripts per-character AND classifies word-based scripts on whitespace boundaries simultaneously.
- **`applyHistory` — broadcast before `getDialogue`.** The cloud read (Upstash, 1–3 s) ran before the first `broadcast()`, so the gauge stayed frozen until the network round-trip completed — even though the history estimate was already computed. Broadcast the history-only estimate immediately so the panel updates in < 500 ms; read cloud + union-merge asynchronously and re-broadcast only if the merged result differs. The panel listens for `STATE_UPDATE` and re-renders instantly — no refresh needed.
