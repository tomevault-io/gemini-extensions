## 1. What it is

**Arco** is a **Windows-first** desktop app that organizes, operates, and resumes multiple coding
agents (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode) and shells in parallel, inside a persistent workspace with
real terminals (PTYs), layouts, themes, history, and RAM control.

> Tagline: **Reveal the state of every agent, shell, and project.**
> Status: **v1.3.0**, functional MVP in polish. Identifier: `com.mota.arco`.

## 2. Where you are

At the repository root — the app directory. It contains:

- `src/` — React frontend.
- `electron/` — the application shell: window, command router (`commands/`), PTY and speech hosts.
- `src-tauri/` — the previous Rust/Tauri shell, kept as legacy (not released).
- `docs/` — versioned docs (`FEATURES.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `OVERVIEW.md`, `BRAND.md`,
  `DIAGNOSTICO_MATURIDADE_TECNICA.md`).
- `package.json`, `vite.config.ts`, `tsconfig.json`, `tests/`.

## 3. Stack

- **Frontend:** React 18.3 · TypeScript 5.6 · Vite 6 · Zustand 5 · xterm.js 5.5 (`@xterm/addon-fit`, `-search`, `-webgl`) · `react-resizable-panels` · `@dnd-kit/core` · `@radix-ui/react-dialog` · `lucide-react` · `nanoid`.
- **Shell / backend:** Electron 43 (Chromium) · `electron/main.cjs` command router · PTY host on
  `@homebridge/node-pty-prebuilt-multiarch` · speech host on `sherpa-onnx`.
- **Legacy shell:** `src-tauri/` still holds the Rust/Tauri build the app used before v2. It is kept
  for reference and is not part of a release. Do not add features there.
- **Styling:** CSS Modules + CSS custom properties (no Tailwind, no styled-components).

## 4. Commands (from `package.json`)

```bash
npm install
npm run app      # builds the frontend and runs the full app (RECOMMENDED WAY)
npm run dev      # Vite frontend only, at http://localhost:1422 (strictPort)
npm run build    # tsc + vite build — tsc typechecks and VALIDATES i18n (see §5)
npm run package  # AppImage into dist-electron/
npm test         # vitest run over tests/**/*.test.ts (test:node runs via node --test, separately)
```

To iterate with hot reload, run `npm run dev` and start the shell against it:
`ARCO_DEV_URL=http://localhost:1422 npm run app:nobuild`.

The packaged app needs **Node installed on the machine**: the PTY and speech hosts run under the
system Node, because their native bindings target Node's ABI and are not rebuilt for Electron.

When returning the path of a generated installer or bundle, always report the **full absolute path**
(for example, `/home/user/projects/arco/dist-electron/Arco-2.0.0.AppImage`), never just the path
relative to the repository.



## 5. Non-negotiable rules

1. **DO NOT stop or restart the app or the dev server** (the shell / Vite). Do not kill the
   process, do not run `npm run app` "just to test" if it is already running. Apply changes through
   **HMR** and trust the reload.
2. **DO NOT commit / push / tag / release without explicit permission from the owner at that
   moment.** Make changes **in the working tree only** and stop — committing is his call. When he
   authorizes a commit, **DO NOT add a co-author** (`Co-Authored-By: Claude …`) or any tool
   signature to the message — he is the only author.
3. **Strict design system — no gradients, nothing "vibecoded".** No generic template UI. Dashboards
   and widgets show **real data**, never placeholder/mock. Style through CSS Modules + tokens from
   `src/styles/theme.css`; **never** hardcode a color — use the variables (`--bg`, `--fg`,
   `--accent`, `--agent-*`, `--status-*`, etc.).
4. **i18n is mandatory.** Every visible string goes through `t()`. When adding text, register the key
   in `src/lib/i18n/messages/en.ts` (**source of truth**, default EN) **and** in
   `src/lib/i18n/messages/pt-BR.ts`. `pt-BR.ts` is typed against the keys of `en.ts`, so
   `npm run build` **fails** if a translation is missing.
5. **Changelog is mandatory for features.** Every feature addition, change, or removal must update
   [`docs/CHANGELOG.md`](docs/CHANGELOG.md) in the same task, under the **`[Unreleased]`** section
   (top of the file), with a short, objective, user-facing description. Never skip this step — the
   changelog is the source for release notes.
6. **Releasing follows [`docs/RELEASE.md`](docs/RELEASE.md), in order.** The `/release` skill in
   `.claude/skills/release/` runs it end to end. The changelog is not the
   only place a release has to touch: the dialog the user reads lives in `src/lib/changelogData.ts`
   plus the `whatsNew.*` keys in both message files, and a version shipped without an entry there
   tells the user the update never arrived. `main` must contain the release before it is cut —
   cutting from a branch leaves the next version number below what is already installed. Both
   mistakes have shipped; `npm run release` now refuses to run when either is present.

7. **Speed is the product.** Arco is judged by how fast it feels — typing, switching a session,
   opening a project. A change that costs a frame on any of those paths is a regression even when
   every test is green, and "correct but heavier" is not a trade this app makes. Before touching the
   terminal path, ask what the change costs per keystroke, per repaint and per switch, and prefer the
   version that does less work over the one that is easier to write. Deferring work is not removing
   it: output held back and flushed later is still paid for, and it gets paid at the worst possible
   moment — the instant the user asks to see it. Measure on the real app, with several sessions open;
   a change that only feels fine with one pane has not been tested.

8. **The CI runs before every push, locally.** `husky` fires `npm run ci`, which mirrors
   `.github/workflows/ci.yml` step by step: lint, formatting, unit tests, typecheck, build and the
   Electron boot smoke — about 45s. It sits on pre-push, not pre-commit: what has to stay green is
   the branch everyone pulls, and charging that on every local commit only teaches people to commit
   less often. `git push --no-verify` exists for when the gate is wrong and you can say why; it is
   not for when the gate is inconvenient. Change a step in the workflow and change
   `scripts/ci-local.mjs` with it, or the two drift and the local green stops meaning anything.

## 6. Architecture at a glance

**Frontend (`src/`)**
- `components/` — UI by feature (`HomeView/`, `WorkspaceView/`, `XTermView/`, `ProjectSidebar/`, `TitleBar/`, `modals/`…). One `.module.css` per component.
- `stores/` — Zustand: `projectsStore` (projects/terminals/preferences, **persisted** to `projects.json`) and `uiStore` (modals/toasts/ephemeral state).
- `lib/tauri/` — `invoke` wrapper, split by domain (`git`, `pty`, `agents`, `usage`…), with `index.ts` re-exporting everything — call sites keep importing from `lib/tauri` unchanged.
- `lib/i18n/` — the i18n system (`index.ts` + `messages/en.ts` + `messages/pt-BR.ts`).
- `lib/types.ts` — domain types (`AgentType`, `Terminal`, `Project`, `WorkspaceContainer`…).
- `styles/theme.css` + `styles/reset.css` — tokens and reset.

**Shell (`electron/`)**
- `main.cjs` — window, `arco://` app protocol, PTY host supervision, `tauri:invoke` router.
- `preload.cjs` — implements the `window.__TAURI_INTERNALS__` contract the frontend calls.
- `commands/` — one module per domain (`git`, `sessions`, `usage`, `planning`, `skills`,
  `resources`, `telemetry`, `platform`, `system`, `library`, `worktrees`, `hooks`, `dictation`).
  Every command reads and writes the same files the legacy Rust build did.
- `pty-host.cjs` / `speech-host.cjs` — separate Node processes, so a crash there cannot take the
  window down.

**Legacy backend (`src-tauri/src/`)**
- `lib.rs` — `invoke_handler` (registration of every `#[tauri::command]`).
- `pty.rs` — spawn/attach/write/resize/restart/kill of PTYs + on-disk scrollback.
- `projects.rs` — atomic load/save of `projects.json`. `profiles` — isolated multi-profile support.
- `cli_resolver.rs` — discovers CLIs (pwsh/powershell, Node managers, VS Code) on Windows.
- `claude_sessions.rs` / `codex_sessions.rs` / `claude_usage.rs` — session and usage reading.
- `backup.rs`, `diagnostics.rs`, `agent_library.rs`, `agent_events.rs`, `stats.rs`.

**Communication:** the frontend calls `invoke(...)` through `lib/tauri/`; the terminal receives
streaming through the Tauri events `pty://data/{id}` and `pty://exit/{id}`.

## 7. Conventions

- One `.module.css` file per component; color/spacing always through tokens, never literals.
- New domain types go in `src/lib/types.ts`; reuse the existing ones.
- Lean Zustand selectors to avoid rerender loops; `projects.json` is saved with debounce and atomic
  writes (tmp → rename) — preserve that pattern.
- The `projects.json` schema is versioned with migration/backfill — when changing its shape, keep the
  migration.

## 8. Gotchas / security

- The renderer reaches every command through `tauri:invoke`. Treat any rendered input as untrusted.
- `spawn_pty` runs a shell with the command/args coming from the frontend — **validate input on the
  frontend** before spawning.
- OAuth tokens (Claude) are stored in **plaintext** in app data; do not log or expose them.
- The Windows build requires `vcvars64`. The Rust toolchain on `C:` can be corrupted by Windows
  Defender — prefer building from `D:`.
- Local data: `%APPDATA%/Arco/` (profiles, `projects.json`, scrollback `*.bin`, `spawn.log`).

## Language and comment rules

- English is the default language for all versioned repository content, including source comments,
  JSDoc, documentation, changelog entries, user-facing strings, commit messages, and pull requests.
- Never add Portuguese prose to source comments, JSDoc, internal logs, or documentation. Translate any
  non-English comment encountered in a file being changed.
- Use another language only when the target file explicitly requires it. Locale files are the standard
  exception: translated UI text belongs in the matching locale file.
- When editing existing mixed-language content, translate the touched content to English when practical
  instead of extending the language inconsistency.
- Keep comments concise. Add them only when they explain non-obvious behavior, constraints, or decisions.

This project has a knowledge graph at graphify-out/ with god nodes, community structure, and cross-file relationships.

Universal across the 3 agent providers Arco spawns (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode) when the project has Graphify enabled: each gets the Graphify MCP server wired into its session automatically (Claude via `--mcp-config`; Codex/OpenCode via `.codex/config.toml`/`opencode.json` in the project root — see `graphify_codex_config_write`/`graphify_opencode_config_write` in `src-tauri/src/graphify.rs`).

Rules:
- If a Graphify MCP tool (e.g. `graphify_query`/similar) is available in this session, prefer calling it directly over shelling out — same scoped-subgraph result, no extra process spawn.
- Otherwise, for codebase questions, first run `graphify query "<question>"` when graphify-out/graph.json exists. Use `graphify path "<A>" "<B>"` for relationships and `graphify explain "<concept>"` for focused concepts. These return a scoped subgraph, usually much smaller than GRAPH_REPORT.md or raw grep output.
- If graphify-out/wiki/index.md exists, use it for broad navigation instead of raw source browsing.
- Read graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md only for broad architecture review or when query/path/explain do not surface enough context.
- After modifying code, run `graphify update .` to keep the graph current (AST-only, no API cost).
