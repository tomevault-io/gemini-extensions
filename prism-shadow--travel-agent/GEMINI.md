# travel-agent — Agent Development Guide

## Core Reminder

Reason from first principles, end to end. When the evidence does not support a conclusion, say
"no basis found" instead of presenting an inference as a finding.

## Product Direction

travel-agent is an **open-source consumer travel application** built on **PenguinHarness** (the
agent engine) and **penguin-browser** (the visible in-app browser, plus an optional connection to
the user's own Chrome). It is the only place those two are joined. Its first-class object is the
**Trip**; the interaction it is judged on is one sentence → a few represented options, each with a
reason → a click that is also authorization → the form filled → **a stop at the payment page**.

The goal, the requirements that keep that sentence true, and the scope table of what this product
adopts and declines — with the reason for each — are the root of the spec graph:
**[`SPEC.md`](SPEC.md)**. Read it before proposing a feature; it is what settles whether the
feature belongs here at all.

## Hard Rules

1. **English is the repository's working language.** Everything you write is English — code,
   comments, commit messages, error and log output, test names and fixtures, package metadata, and
   every document under `docs/` and `tasks/`, and every spec. This is not a preference about style; a
   comment or design note that only some readers can parse is documentation that does not exist for
   the rest of them.

   Chinese appears only where it **is** the content, never where it *describes* the content:

   | Allowed | Because |
   | --- | --- |
   | zh i18n catalogs and fields — `strings.ts`, `i18n.ts`, `titleZh`, `short_description_zh` | The string *is* the product's Chinese UI |
   | `*.zh.md` documents (`README.zh.md`) | A deliberate translation, paired with an English original |
   | Test literals asserting zh output or CJK behavior | The literal is the thing under test |

   Some older documents under `docs/` are still Chinese and are being translated. Do not add to
   them in Chinese, and translate the file you are editing if the change is substantial.
2. **Every change leaves the specs true.** There is no changelog. **What changed** is git history —
   write the commit message as the entry: what changed, why, and what you ran to verify it.
   **What is true** is the spec graph, rooted at [`SPEC.md`](SPEC.md) — a change that alters a
   boundary, a contract or a decision updates the owning spec in the *same commit*, and one that
   settles a trade-off worth remembering adds a note under `docs/decisions/`. A spec left describing
   the old behaviour is part of the defect, not a follow-up.
3. **The engine baseline is pinned.** `packages/core` and `packages/server` are a hard-fork snapshot
   of PenguinHarness 0.2.2 (`d14be6f`). Do not merge upstream. Do not "improve" them opportunistically
   — changes there are a deliberate decision, not a side effect.
4. **The model judges; code only enforces.** Write enforcement code only where the model is itself
   inside the threat model. `@travel-agent/domain` was deleted for violating this: two of its three
   pieces were judgements a model makes better than a rule table, and had sat with no caller through
   six phases. The later `packages/transaction` experiment was retired for the same reason: its
   active interaction contract belongs to the server, browser handover belongs to browser-cli, and
   its payment execution machinery had no reachable production executor.
5. **PenguinHarness must not know penguin-browser exists.** The engine provides the agent runtime;
   penguin-browser provides browser control; travel-agent is the only place that joins them.
   Do not add a dependency in that direction.
6. **No silent fallback between browser backends.** The choice is per conversation and cannot change
   while a task runs. An unavailable persisted choice stays visible as unavailable; showing the other
   backend would be a false state.
7. **Payment stops at the gate.** The agent does not press the button that takes the money. The
   enforced production gate lives in `packages/browser-cli/src/executor/payment-gate.ts` and has no
   enable flag. When adding a surface that can click, wire it through the gate — *enumerate, do not
   sample* (`write-gate.ts` states the rule).
8. **Read the current file before editing it.** Keep changes scoped to the request; prefer existing
   repo patterns over a new abstraction.

## Repo Layout

```
packages/core, server        PenguinHarness engine baseline (pinned snapshot; @prismshadow/*)
packages/web                 The active consumer UI, shared by web and desktop
packages/desktop             Electron shell: in-app browser, vault, packaging
packages/browser-cli         penguin-browser: CLI, CDP relay, Playwright executor (vendored)
packages/browser-extension   Chrome extension bridging the relay to the user's Chrome (vendored)
packages/skills              Built-in skill library, incl. skills/penguin-browser
```

`browser-cli` and `browser-extension` are a snapshot of upstream `penguin-browser` at `ba9e13b`
(2026-08-12): upstream history stays in the upstream repo; post-import changes are in this
repository's git history.

Both browser backends converge on the same relay and Playwright execution layer; they differ only in
the debugger bridge and the profile being driven. See `docs/architecture/iab-in-app-browser.md`.

## Worktrees

Linked worktrees live inside the checkout at `.worktree/<task>` — `git worktree add
.worktree/<task> -b <branch>` — never as sibling directories outside it. The directory is
git-ignored and its contents are never committed from the main tree. Once a worktree's branch
has merged, remove the folder: `git worktree remove .worktree/<task>`.

## Documentation Map

Read the project's own documents before inferring behavior from code.

| Topic | Document |
| --- | --- |
| What the product must do, and the scope it declines | [`SPEC.md`](SPEC.md) |
| What a module owns and may depend on | that package's `SPEC.md` |
| Where any piece of prose belongs (the tier table) | [`docs/AGENTS.md`](docs/AGENTS.md) |
| Project architecture, as built | [`docs/architecture/README.md`](docs/architecture/README.md) |
| In-app browser architecture, as built | [`docs/architecture/iab-in-app-browser.md`](docs/architecture/iab-in-app-browser.md) |
| Decision records: the why and what was given up | [`docs/decisions/`](docs/decisions/README.md) |
| Full incident stories | [`docs/postmortem/`](docs/postmortem/README.md) |
| Known open problems | [`docs/issues/`](docs/issues/) |
| Competitor and product research snapshots | [`docs/research/`](docs/research/) |
| Lessons that must not be learned twice | [`tasks/lessons.md`](tasks/lessons.md) |
| In-flight plans and working ledgers | [`tasks/`](tasks/README.md) |

Specs are navigable as a graph: a file whose frontmatter carries `id` and `type` is a spec node,
linked by `parent` and `depends-on`, and the `spec_*` tools walk it. A spec states what is true now
and never narrates — the rule, and what is deliberately not yet a node, are in
[`docs/AGENTS.md`](docs/AGENTS.md).

Records versus living docs: git history, `docs/research/` and `docs/postmortem/` are
**dated records** — do not rewrite them to match today's code. READMEs, the specs,
`docs/architecture/`, `docs/decisions/` and source comments are **living** —
update them in the same change that makes them wrong (an implemented decision note keeps its facts
current; the decision itself is superseded by a new note, never rewritten).

## Commands

Needs Node >= 24 and pnpm 11. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` for model credentials in development.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build          # build first: core's exports point at dist/
pnpm dev            # backend + web together
pnpm desktop        # Electron shell

pnpm format:check
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test

npx playwright install chromium                   # once, for the e2e suites
pnpm --filter @prismshadow/penguin-web test:e2e   # browser e2e against a mock LLM
pnpm test:e2e                                     # core live-model e2e; needs DEEPSEEK_API_KEY
```

### Browser QA login

Every fresh data root seeds the product's fixed initial credentials, and `~/.penguin/dev-data`
uses the same pair for local Playwriter QA against `pnpm dev`:

- Username: `traveler`
- Password: `traveler-2026`

The pair is `INITIAL_ADMIN_CREDENTIALS` in `packages/server/src/api/types.ts`, public by decision
(`docs/decisions/implemented/2026-09-05-fixed-initial-credentials.md`). `PENGUIN_SEED_ADMIN_PASSWORD`
overrides the password for a run that must not start on the default. Revalidate this login after
changing the admin password in the development data.

## The gate before a push

`ci.yml` runs on every push to main and every pull request (re-enabled 2026-09-05; it was paused
from 2026-08-27 for cost). It is a second opinion, not a substitute: it reproduces the gate below
on Linux, after the push. Run the gate locally first — all of it, not the part that looks related:

```bash
node packages/desktop/scripts/check-debug-switches.mjs && \
pnpm build && pnpm format:check && pnpm typecheck && pnpm test && \
pnpm --filter @prismshadow/penguin-web test:e2e && \
pnpm --filter @prismshadow/penguin-desktop test:e2e && \
pnpm test:e2e
```

About eight minutes on an 8-core Linux box (the web browser suite and the browser-cli unit tests
are the two largest shares), and it reproduces every CI step except one: **Linux**. The in-app
browser e2e needs `xvfb-run` only on Linux and runs natively on macOS; the live-model e2e needs
`DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` in `.env` (leave `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` empty, or the run takes the Claude path
instead of the one CI used).

The web browser suite is in that list as of 2026-08-28, and its absence is why it is worth naming
here: `pnpm test` does not run Playwright, and neither this gate nor `ci.yml` invoked
`packages/web/e2e` at all, so twenty-one of its specs were free to go red and stay red without a
single gate noticing. A suite nothing runs is not a slower gate; it is a suite that does not
exist.

Two things this gate does **not** cover, and neither is a reason to skip it:

- **Linux-only behaviour** — Electron's sandbox under the AppArmor userns restriction, path and
  line-ending differences. `pre-release.yml` (manual) holds the Windows suite for the same reason.
- **The agent loop.** `pnpm test:e2e` is one test: it asks a real model for a short reply and checks
  the stream and the token usage. It proves the model is reachable. It does not prove a task runs
  end to end — there is no end-to-end agent acceptance test today.

Every `dev:*` command runs `scripts/dev-prebuild.mjs` first, behind a lock that serializes
concurrent invocations: it keeps `pnpm install` current, prebuilds the workspace deps, dedupes
back-to-back builds so `pnpm dev` installs and builds exactly once, and clears the web app's Vite
dep cache when skills or core output changed — that cache is keyed by lockfile and config only, so
it would otherwise keep serving the browser the previous core.

Dev entry points that touch data default to `~/.penguin/dev-data`, separate from an installed app's
`~/.penguin/data`. Never point them at real user state.

CI is four workflows. `ci.yml` runs on every push to main and every pull request. `pre-release.yml`
is manual and holds what is only worth paying for before a build ships — the Windows suite; run it
before cutting a Release. `release.yml` is manual: given a tag it calls `desktop-build.yml` for the
three-OS Electron installers, then creates a **draft** GitHub Release with the installers, the
updater metadata and SHA256SUMS; a person reviews the draft and publishes it, which is what creates
the tag. `desktop-build.yml` can also be dispatched alone for a dry run. macOS artifacts are signed
and notarized only when the `apple-signing` environment holds the Apple secrets and the run asks
for it; Windows artifacts are unsigned today. The repository has been public since 2026-09-05, so
GitHub-hosted standard runners are free of charge and Releases are public downloads. (While it was
private, minutes were billed — Windows at 2x, macOS at 10x — which is why `ci.yml` was paused for a
month and why the workflow comments still weigh cost.) Pushing once per batch of commits is still
the habit: it keeps the Actions history readable and a red run attributable to one change.

Pull requests branch from `main` and keep to one topic; new user-facing behaviour comes with tests,
and with the spec update that keeps Hard Rule 2 true.

## Agent Artifacts

Product Design QA is local working evidence, not repository documentation. When a Product Design
workflow requires `design-qa.md`, write it to `artifacts/design-qa/design-qa.md` instead of the
repository root, and keep its supporting screenshots and comparison files in the same directory.
`artifacts/` is gitignored and must not be committed.

## Lessons

[`tasks/lessons.md`](tasks/lessons.md) is the single home for what was expensive to learn — the
failures that cost hours because nothing surfaces them. **Read it before the first change in an
unfamiliar area, and add to it whenever something costs you an hour that one sentence would have
saved.** It is organized as:

| Section | Answers |
| --- | --- |
| Product and behaviour | Backend defaults vs availability, no-silent-fallback, cross-process state, browser-chrome fidelity |
| Build, workspace and layout | Package-relative paths, injected-dependency sync, compiler rules as directories, what a `tsconfig` include actually emits |
| Testing and verification | Cold-start boundaries, establishing a baseline, a suite that fails differently each run, dynamic imports defeating a dead-code search |

Do not restate a lesson in this file. The four documents divide the work: **Hard Rules** above are
absolute and non-negotiable; `tasks/lessons.md` is judgement that has to be applied; `docs/issues/`
is what is still broken; `docs/postmortem/` is the full story a lesson compresses — a lesson links
its postmortem when one exists.

## Open Issues

| # | Problem |
| --- | --- |
| [0008](docs/issues/0008-active-session-lags-one-conversation.md) | **Closed.** The stamp guard makes the stale state unrepresentable; the refusal log has not fired since the guard shipped |
| [0010](docs/issues/0010-web-browser-e2e-is-red.md) | **Closed.** All 34 specs pass (was 5 red from the original issue + 3 from the consumer-surface refactoring); the gate step now passes |
| [0011](docs/issues/0011-trip-directory-collision-ceiling.md) | **Closed.** Atomic random suffix allocation handles exhausted readable names without reusing existing directories |

## Editing Workflow

1. Gather evidence before writing code — read the existing implementation, the decision note that
   governs it (`docs/decisions/`), and the tests that pin it. Search the repo before searching the
   web.
2. For a simple fix, proceed. For anything crossing packages or touching a gate, write the plan first.
3. Prefer the smallest change that makes the invariant hold. When a change spans layers (schema,
   helper, route; or relay, executor, UI), update them in the same commit.
4. Verify with the real gates — `pnpm typecheck`, the affected package's tests, and a build when the
   change touches paths, layout, or bundling. Record what you ran.
5. Write the commit message as the record — what changed, why, what you ran — and update every spec
   and living doc the change made wrong, in that same commit.

## Current State

- The product UI evolves as travel-agent's own consumer surface.
- Interaction cards are owned by `packages/server`; browser handover and the unconditional payment
  stop are owned by `packages/browser-cli`. There is no agent-triggered payment execution path.
- Capability gates `vault.l2l3` and `secret_entry.live` are **fail-closed**,
  behind the unresolved isolation decision D3
  (`docs/decisions/proposed/2026-08-16-agent-runtime-isolation.md`). Code may be written
  ahead of them; the four ordinary browser outputs are wired through redaction, but that guardrail
  does not substitute for the unresolved runtime boundary.
- Nothing in this repo publishes to a registry today.
