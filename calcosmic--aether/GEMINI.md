# AGENTS.md -- Aether Development Guide (Codex CLI)

> **Current Version:** v1.0.34
> **Last Updated:** 2026-05-06
> **Platform:** Codex CLI (OpenAI)

This file provides project-level instructions for Codex CLI, equivalent to
`CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code. Aether supports three platforms: Claude Code,
OpenCode, and Codex CLI.

## Platform Policy

- **Primary platforms:** Claude Code and OpenCode. These are the main maintained user surfaces.
- **Secondary platform:** Codex CLI. Codex has best-effort support for the direct `aether` workflow.
- **What that means for Codex:** keep the native CLI lifecycle, install/update flow, state integrity, and worker dispatch safe and usable. Codex UX polish and wrapper semantics may lag behind Claude/OpenCode.

## How Aether Works in Codex CLI

Codex CLI does not support slash commands. All colony operations use the `aether`
CLI binary directly or natural language prompts. There is no equivalent of
typing `/ant-build 1` -- instead you run:

```bash
aether build 1
aether plan
aether init "Build feature X"
aether continue
aether status
```

When the user types a literal `aether ...` command in Codex, execute that exact
CLI command first for literal passthrough commands such as `status`, `update`,
`focus`, `pheromones`, and `reference-list`.

Exception: `aether init`, `aether oracle`, `aether plan`, `aether build`,
`aether continue`, `aether seal`, and `aether discuss` have wrapper-equivalent
Codex orchestration. For those commands, run or inspect
`aether command-guide <command> --platform codex` and use the matching Codex
skill (`aether-colony-creation`, `aether-colony-research`, or
`aether-colony-build-cycle`) unless the user explicitly says raw, exact,
no-interview, or no-orchestration.

Use `aether --help` as the runtime source of truth if markdown docs disagree.
For lifecycle commands run through Codex shell execution, prefer
`AETHER_OUTPUT_MODE=visual aether ...` unless the user explicitly wants JSON.
Do not preface literal passthrough commands with repo archaeology, skill
narration, or "I'm checking..." commentary. The CLI output is primary; your own
wrapper should be zero or one short sentence.

Agent definitions live in `.codex/agents/*.toml` (TOML format) and Codex reads
them as part of its agent discovery system.

## UX Architecture

Codex gets its colony identity entirely from the Go runtime visual renderer
(`cmd/codex_visuals.go`). Unlike Claude/OpenCode, Codex does NOT use wrapper
markdown — the CLI output IS the presentation.

### Caste Identity System

Each worker caste has:
- **Emoji prefix** — decorative icon (e.g., `🔨` for Builder, `👁️` for Watcher)
- **ANSI-colored label** — the primary identity, colored by caste (e.g., "Builder" in yellow, "Watcher" in cyan)
- **Deterministic name** — hash-based per caste+task (e.g., "Mason-67", "Keen-6")

Visual format: `🔨 Builder Mason-67  Task description`

Color detection uses `NO_COLOR`, `AETHER_FORCE_COLOR`, `CLICOLOR_FORCE`, and TTY
checks. In non-TTY or JSON mode, colors are disabled and only plain text appears.

### Stage Markers

Build and continue output uses stage transition markers:
```
── Context ──
── Tasks ──
── Dispatch ──
── Verification ──
── Housekeeping ──
── Next Phase ──
── Colony Complete ──
```

### Output Modes

| Mode | When | Content |
|------|------|---------|
| Visual | `AETHER_OUTPUT_MODE=visual` or TTY | ANSI banners, emojis, colors, stage markers, context-clear guidance |
| JSON | `AETHER_OUTPUT_MODE=json` or piped | Structured data envelopes for programmatic use |

### Codex Orchestration Layer

Claude/OpenCode wrappers add colony framing, scoping interviews, worker
orchestration, and post-command narration on top of runtime output. Codex has no
slash-command wrapper files, so the equivalent layer is:

- `aether command-guide <command> --platform codex` for command-specific steps
- `aether-colony-creation` for init synthesis
- `aether-colony-research` for oracle/discuss synthesis
- `aether-colony-build-cycle` for plan/build/continue/seal orchestration

For pure visual/runtime polish, change `cmd/codex_visuals.go`. For intelligent
command behavior, keep the YAML source, Claude/OpenCode wrappers, Codex skill,
and `cmd/command_guide.go` aligned in the same change.

```

Colony-prime assembles worker context from: QUEEN.md wisdom, eternal memory,
pheromone signals, phase learnings, key decisions, blocker flags, user preferences,
parallel mode, and context capsule -- all within a token budget (see Token Budget).

**See `RUNTIME UPDATE ARCHITECTURE.md` for complete distribution flow.**

### Runtime Lifecycle Diagram

One build cycle, model-agnostic. Shows both parallel modes in a single graph:
the `in-repo` path is solid, the `worktree` path with sync-back is dashed. The
Skill Matching sub-graph is the `skill-match` → `skill-inject` flow called out
in the Skills System section.

For beginners: the Queen is the head chef, colony-prime is the whiteboard she
reads before giving each cook their recipe, the sub-graph labelled "Skill
Matching" picks which recipe cards (skills) to hand out, and the quality gates
at the end are the tasters before a plate leaves the kitchen.

and `hive/wisdom.json` live under `~/.aether/`; repo-specific Queen wisdom lives
in `.aether/QUEEN.md`. `skill-index`, `skill-match`, and `skill-inject` are real
subcommands (see Skills System). Gate order matches the Quality Gates table.

## Development Workflow

### Editing System Files

| What you're changing | Where to edit | Why |
|---------------------|---------------|-----|
| Worker definitions | Aether repo `.aether/` `workers.md` | Source of truth, published to hub |
| Go commands | `cmd/` | Go source code |
| User docs | `.aether/docs/` | Distributed directly |
| Codex agent definitions | `.codex/agents/*.toml` | Codex CLI agent format |
| Claude Code commands | `.claude/commands/ant/` | Claude Code commands |
| OpenCode commands | `.opencode/commands/ant/` | OpenCode commands |
| Claude Code agents | `.claude/agents/ant/` | Claude Code agents |
| OpenCode agents | `.opencode/agents/` | OpenCode worker definitions |
| Your notes | `.aether/dreams/` | Never distributed |
| Dev docs | `.aether/docs/known-issues.md` | Distributed |

### Core Workflow

Codex currently exposes the core colony lifecycle directly:

```bash
aether lay-eggs
aether init "Build feature X"
aether discuss
aether colonize
aether plan
aether run --dry-run
aether swarm --watch
aether build 1
aether continue
aether seal
aether oracle "release concern"
```

Codex also exposes compatibility entrypoints for the flows users reach for most:
`aether run` for autopilot-style build/continue looping, `aether watch` for live
worker visibility, and `aether oracle` for the autonomous Oracle RALF research loop.
Treat these as supported best-effort compatibility entrypoints within Codex's
native CLI workflow, rather than strict mirrors of Claude/OpenCode slash-command UX.

### Publishing Changes

Authoritative runbook: `.aether/docs/publish-update-runbook.md`

```bash
# 1. Edit canonical source files in the Aether repo
vim .aether/commands/build.yaml

# 2. Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "your message"

# 3. Publish the source checkout to the hub and rebuild the local binary
aether publish --channel stable --binary-dest "$HOME/.local/bin"

# 4. In other repos, pull hub-backed cleanup and guidance updates
aether update --force
```

Runtime note:
- `aether publish` is the primary publish command. It builds the binary, syncs companion files to the hub, and verifies version agreement automatically.
- `aether install --package-dir "$PWD"` still works for backward compatibility but does not include version verification.
- `aether update` in other repos only syncs companion files by default. It does not publish an unreleased local runtime change, and without `--force` it can leave stale Aether-managed files behind.
- `aether update --force --download-binary` is the published-release path when you also need the release runtime binary.
- For isolated source-development on this machine, publish the dev channel instead: `aether publish --channel dev --binary-dest "$HOME/.local/bin"` and then use `aether-dev update --force` in target repos. This keeps `~/.aether-dev/` and `aether-dev` separate from the public stable runtime.
- `.aether/version.json` is the source-checkout release version file. `npm/package.json` must match it exactly for published releases.
- If `aether update --force` shows `Commands (claude)` or `Commands (opencode)` as `0 copied, 0 unchanged`, the hub publish is incomplete. Republish from the Aether repo first, then rerun `aether update --force` in the target repo.
- If the change modifies publish/install/update logic, bootstrap once with `go run ./cmd/aether publish --channel stable --binary-dest "$HOME/.local/bin"` so the new logic publishes the hub and rebuilds the shared binary from source.
- Published release flow: bump `.aether/version.json` and `npm/package.json` to the same version, push the commit, then push tag `vX.Y.Z`.

## Aether CLI Commands

Since Codex CLI has no slash commands, all colony operations use the `aether` CLI.

### Setup and Getting Started

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `aether lay-eggs` | Set up Aether in this repo (one-time, creates .aether/) |

aether build 1
aether continue
aether build 2                           # repeat until complete

# Or let Codex run the loop
aether run --max-phases 2

aether resume
aether status

# Research a release concern
aether oracle "release parity"

# After completing a colony
aether seal
aether init "next project goal"
```

## Key Directories

### .codex/ (Codex CLI Agent Definitions)

```
.codex/
+-- agents/                # 25 agent definitions (TOML format)
|   +-- aether-builder.toml
|   +-- aether-watcher.toml
|   +-- aether-scout.toml
|   +-- ...
```

Each TOML file defines an agent with: name, description, nickname_candidates,
and developer_instructions. Codex reads these for agent discovery.

### .aether/ (Source of Truth)

```
.aether/
+-- workers.md           # Worker definitions, spawn protocol
+-- utils/               # Runtime utilities
|   +-- oracle/oracle.md # Oracle loop instructions
|   +-- queen-to-md.xsl  # XSL transform for queen wisdom export
+-- skills/              # colony/ (11) + domain/ (18) skill definitions
+-- templates/           # 12 templates (colony-state, pheromones, etc.)
+-- docs/                # Distributed documentation
+-- exchange/            # XML exchange modules (pheromone-xml, wisdom-xml)
+-- data/                # LOCAL ONLY (never distributed)
|   +-- COLONY_STATE.json  # Colony state with phase tracking + parallel_mode
|   +-- pheromones.json
|   +-- constraints.json
|   +-- midden/          # Failure tracking
|   +-- survey/          # Territory survey results
+-- dreams/              # LOCAL ONLY (session notes)
+-- oracle/              # LOCAL ONLY (deep research)
```

### Split Playbooks (Reliability)

High-length commands are split into smaller execution playbooks:

- `.aether/docs/command-playbooks/build-prep.md`
- `.aether/docs/command-playbooks/build-context.md`
- `.aether/docs/command-playbooks/build-wave.md`
- `.aether/docs/command-playbooks/build-verify.md`
- `.aether/docs/command-playbooks/build-complete.md`
- `.aether/docs/command-playbooks/continue-verify.md`
- `.aether/docs/command-playbooks/continue-gates.md`
- `.aether/docs/command-playbooks/continue-advance.md`
- `.aether/docs/command-playbooks/continue-finalize.md`

Authority note:
- In Claude Code, `.claude/commands/ant/build.md` and `.claude/commands/ant/continue.md` are orchestrators only.
- Build/continue execution behavior is defined in `.aether/docs/command-playbooks/*.md`.
- OpenCode maintains separate command specs in `.opencode/commands/ant/*.md`.
- Codex CLI uses the `aether` CLI binary directly (no slash command mechanism).
- Agent parity model: `.claude/agents/ant/*.md`, `.opencode/agents/*.md`, and `.codex/agents/*.toml` are canonical platform sources. `aether publish` installs those sources into the global hub; there are no repo-local packaging mirrors.

## Pheromone System

User-colony communication via signals:

| Signal | CLI Command | Priority | Use For |
|--------|-------------|----------|---------|
| FOCUS | `aether focus "<area>"` | normal | "Pay attention here" |
| REDIRECT | `aether redirect "<avoid>"` | high | "Don't do this" (hard constraint) |
| FEEDBACK | `aether feedback "<note>"` | low | "Adjust based on this observation" |

**Before builds:** FOCUS + REDIRECT to steer
**After builds:** FEEDBACK to adjust
**Hard constraints:** REDIRECT (will break)
**Gentle nudges:** FEEDBACK (preferences)

**Viewing Signals:**
- `aether pheromones` -- Full table of all active signals
- `pheromone-display` subcommand -- Formatted output with strength % and decay

**Signal Injection:**
- Colony-prime injects active signals into worker prompts via `prompt_section`
- Builder, Watcher, and Scout agents have `pheromone_protocol` sections that instruct them how to act on injected signals
- Signals are grouped by type (FOCUS, REDIRECT, FEEDBACK) in the injected prompt section
- In Codex CLI, active pheromone signals are automatically injected into worker prompts during `build`, `colonize`, and `plan` dispatches

**Content Deduplication (v2.0):**
- Each signal gets a SHA-256 `content_hash` on creation
- Writing a duplicate (same type + content hash) reinforces the existing signal instead of creating a new one
- `suggest-analyze` deduplicates suggestions against existing active signals and session suggestions

**Prompt Injection Sanitization (v2.0):**
- Pheromone content is sanitized before storage: XML structural tags rejected, angle brackets escaped, shell injection patterns blocked
- Content capped at 500 characters

**Exchange:**
- `aether export-signals` -- Export pheromone signals to XML for cross-colony sharing
- `aether import-signals --file <path>` -- Import pheromone signals from XML

## Skills System

Skills provide reusable behavior modules and domain knowledge that workers can load
on demand. Two categories:

- **Colony skills** (55) -- Behavioral patterns that shape how workers operate
  (e.g., TDD discipline, error handling conventions, commit style)
- **Domain skills** (31) -- Technical knowledge for specific frameworks, languages,
  or tools (e.g., React patterns, Go idioms, database optimization)

### Where Skills Live

| Location | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `.aether/skills/` | Shipped skill source of truth in the Aether repo |
| `~/.aether/system/skills/` | Published hub mirror of shipped skills |
| `~/.aether/skills/domain/` | Custom user-created domain skills |
| repo `.aether/skills/` | Repo-specific custom skills only |
| `~/.codex/skills/aether/` | Small Codex shim set that routes to `aether skill-inject` |

### How Matching Works

1. Colony-prime builds a skills index via `skill-index` (cached for performance)
2. `skill-match` scores each skill against the current worker using:
   - Workflow context (`build`, `colonize`, `plan`, `continue`)
   - Worker role (builder, watcher, etc.)
   - Task keywords from the worker assignment
   - `skill-detect` patterns matched against the codebase
3. Top 3 colony skills + top 3 domain skills are selected per worker

### Skill Injection

- Own 8K character budget (independent of the colony-prime token budget)
- Injected into builder and watcher prompts
- `skill-inject` assembles matched skills into a prompt section
- In Codex CLI, skills are automatically matched and injected into worker prompts during `build`, `colonize`, `plan`, and `continue` dispatches

### Subcommands

| Subcommand | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| `skill-index` | Build/read cached skills index |
| `skill-detect` | Detect domain skills matching codebase |
| `skill-match` | Match skills to worker by workflow + role + task + codebase |
| `skill-inject` | Load matched skills into prompt section |
| `skill-list` | List all installed skills |
| `skill-parse-frontmatter` | Parse SKILL.md frontmatter to JSON |
| `skill-diff` | Compare user skill with shipped version |
| `skill-cache-rebuild` | Force rebuild of index cache |

### Custom Skills

- Manual creation: add a `SKILL.md` file to `~/.aether/skills/domain/`
- Use `aether skill-list`, `aether skill-match`, and `aether skill-diff` to validate custom skill behavior

### Update Safety

- Repo-local Codex full-skill mirrors are retired; `aether update --force` prunes stale non-custom copies
- `aether update --force` refreshes tracked files from the hub and may discard local edits in managed paths
- User skills stored outside the tracked Aether paths remain untouched

---

## Token Budget

Colony-prime assembles worker context within a character budget to avoid prompt bloat:

| Mode | Budget | When |
|------|--------|------|
| Normal | 8,000 chars | Default |
| Compact | 4,000 chars | `--compact` flag or auto-detected |

**Retention priority** (highest packed first):
1. Blockers (never trimmed)
2. Pheromone signals
3. User preferences
4. Instincts
5. Colony state
6. Hive wisdom
7. Key decisions
8. Phase learnings

---

## Hive Brain (Cross-Colony Wisdom)

The Hive Brain stores generalized wisdom derived from colony instincts, scoped by
domain, and shared across all colonies on the same machine.

### Storage

```
~/.aether/hive/
+-- wisdom.json          # Cross-colony wisdom (200-entry cap, LRU eviction)
```

### Subcommands

| Subcommand | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| `hive-init` | Initialize hive directory and empty wisdom.json |
| `hive-store` | Store wisdom entry with dedup and 200-cap enforcement |
| `hive-read` | Read wisdom with domain filtering and confidence threshold |
| `hive-abstract` | Generalize repo-specific instinct into cross-colony wisdom |
| `hive-promote` | Orchestrate abstract + store pipeline |

### Multi-Repo Confidence Boosting

| Repos Confirming | Confidence |
|-----------------|------------|
| 2 repos | 0.70 |
| 3 repos | 0.85 |
| 4+ repos | 0.95 |

Confidence is never downgraded. During `aether seal`, instincts with confidence
>= 0.8 are promoted to the Hive Brain (non-blocking).

---

## User Preferences

Stored by `aether preferences` in the hub `~/.aether/QUEEN.md` under the
`## User Preferences` section. Colony-prime also honors repo-local preferences
from `.aether/QUEEN.md`.

- `aether preferences "text"` -- Add a user preference
- `aether preferences --list` -- List all user preferences

Colony-prime injects user preferences into worker context. Max 500 characters
per entry.

## Quality Gates

| Gate | Agent | Runs When | Purpose |
|------|-------|-----------|---------|
| Security | Gatekeeper | After verification | Scans for exposed secrets, debug artifacts |
| Quality | Auditor | After Gatekeeper | Analyzes code quality metrics |
| Coverage | Probe | After Auditor | Analyzes test coverage gaps |
| Performance | Measurer | After Probe | Performance analysis and metrics |

---

## Midden System (Failure Tracking)

- `.aether/data/midden/midden.json` -- Failure records
- `midden-write` -- Log a failure
- `midden-recent-failures` -- Query recent failures
- `midden-review` -- Review unacknowledged entries by category
- `midden-acknowledge` -- Mark entries as addressed
- `aether data-clean` -- Remove test artifacts from data files

---

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Run Go tests
go test ./...

# Run Go tests with race detection
go test ./... -race

# Verify Go binary builds
go build ./cmd/aether

# Run Go vet
go vet ./...

# Verify goreleaser config
goreleaser check

# Build snapshot (no tag required)
goreleaser build --snapshot --clean

# Verify binary works
aether version
```

---

## Session Freshness Detection

All stateful commands use timestamp verification to detect stale sessions:

1. Capture `SESSION_START=$(date +%s)` before spawning agents
2. Check file freshness with `session-verify-fresh --command <name>`
3. Auto-clear stale files or prompt user based on command type
4. Verify files are fresh after spawning

**Protected Commands** (never auto-clear): `init`, `seal`

---

## Session Recovery

On the first message of a new conversation, check if `.aether/data/session.json`
exists. If it does, read briefly for `colony_goal` and display:

```
Previous colony session detected: "{goal}"
Run `aether resume` to restore context, or continue with a new topic.
```

Do NOT auto-restore -- wait for the user to explicitly request it.

---

## Wisdom Pipeline

The core learning loop: observations flow through the system and become reusable
wisdom.

| Stage | Subcommand | Output |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| 1. Observe | `memory-capture --type "learning" --content "..."` | Records observation |
| 1a. Trust score | `trust-score-compute` | Weighted trust score (40/35/25, 7 tiers) |
| 1b. Event bus | `event-bus-publish` | JSONL event bus with TTL |
| 2. Auto-promote | (internal) | Triggers after 2 observations |
| 3. Instinct | `instinct-create` | Stores in `instincts.json` |
| 4. QUEEN.md | `queen-promote` | Writes to QUEEN.md |
| 5. Inject | colony-prime | Injected into worker context |
| 6. Hive store | `hive-promote` | Abstracts to hive (confidence >= 0.8) |
| 7. Hive read | `hive-read` | Cross-colony retrieval by domain |

### Wisdom Pipeline Diagram

The same seven stages drawn as a flow. The multi-repo confidence sub-graph is
the boost table from the Hive Brain section -- one colony's observation becomes
stronger as more repos confirm the same pattern.

For beginners: think of it as a rumour travelling through a village. One person
notices something (observe), the village weighs how trustworthy they are (trust
score), it gets shouted in the square (event bus), and after two people say the
same thing it becomes common knowledge (instinct). Really solid rumours get
written into the village history book (Hive Brain) that neighbouring villages
also read.

Verify: every node maps to a real subcommand (`memory-capture`,
`trust-score-compute`, `event-bus-publish`, `instinct-create`, `queen-promote`,
`hive-promote`, `hive-abstract`, `hive-store`, `hive-read`) or a real file path.
Confidence thresholds match the Multi-Repo Confidence Boosting table.

## Structural Learning Stack

Memory consolidation pipeline with trust scoring, graph relationships, and
automated curation.

Key additions:
- Trust scoring engine (40/35/25 weighted, 60-day half-life, 7 tiers)
- JSONL event bus with pub/sub and TTL cleanup
- Standalone instinct storage with full provenance
- 8 curation ants with orchestrated execution
- Lifecycle integration: phase-end at `aether continue`, full at `aether seal`

### Curation Ants

| Ant | Role |
|-----|------|
| orchestrator | Coordinates curation pipeline execution |
| archivist | Archives and retrieves historical observations |
| critic | Evaluates instinct quality and confidence |
| herald | Broadcasts high-confidence instincts to hive |
| janitor | Cleans stale events and expired TTL entries |
| librarian | Indexes and catalogs instinct relationships |
| nurse | Heals low-confidence instincts with supporting evidence |
| scribe | Records curation decisions and audit trail |
| sentinel | Guards against instinct corruption and conflicts |

---

## Parallel Execution Modes

Aether supports two parallel execution strategies:

| Mode | Value | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| In-repo (default) | `"in-repo"` | Workers share the working tree directly |
| Worktree | `"worktree"` | Each worker gets an isolated git worktree, then file and pheromone changes sync back into the main root |

- `aether parallel-mode get` -- Read current mode
- `aether parallel-mode set <mode>` -- Change mode

**In-repo** is simpler for most projects. **Worktree** provides isolation for
larger tasks with multiple workers touching different files, while keeping the
main root as the final source of truth after sync-back.

---

## The Core Insight

The system's pieces are now **connected**:
- Pheromones update context (colony-prime injects signals into worker prompts)
- Decisions become pheromones (auto-emit during builds)
- Learnings become instincts (observation to promotion pipeline)
- Midden affects behavior (threshold auto-REDIRECT)
- Hive Brain crosses colony boundaries (domain-scoped wisdom -> colony-prime)
- Instincts promote to hive at seal (confidence >= 0.8 -> hive-promote)
- Multi-repo confirmation boosts confidence (2 repos = 0.7, 4+ = 0.95)
- User preferences shape worker behavior (QUEEN.md -> colony-prime)
- Codex uses the direct `build` -> `continue` -> `seal` lifecycle

**The ongoing challenge is maintenance** -- keeping documentation accurate,
data files clean, and test coverage comprehensive as features evolve.
