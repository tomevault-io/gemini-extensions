# Repository Overview

`mcp-email-server` is a Python MCP server that connects MCP clients to email
accounts through IMAP and SMTP.

Canonical repository:

- HTTPS: `https://github.com/Wh1isper/mcp-email-server`
- SSH: `git@github.com:Wh1isper/mcp-email-server.git`

Primary repository areas:

- `mcp_email_server/app.py` — FastMCP server, resources, tools, and tool visibility.
- `mcp_email_server/cli.py` — stdio, SSE, Streamable HTTP, UI, reset, and credential migration commands.
- `mcp_email_server/config.py` — TOML settings, environment composition, account models, and persistence.
- `mcp_email_server/keyring_store.py` — operating system keyring integration.
- `mcp_email_server/emails/` — IMAP and SMTP behavior and response models.
- `mcp_email_server/ui.py` / the replacement Web UI package — the local loopback management adapter and packaged static assets.
- `frontend/` — React/TypeScript management UI source and locked maintainer build.
- `plugins/`, `.agents/`, and `.claude-plugin/` — optional Codex/Claude Code plugin packaging, shared local MCP launch metadata, and safe non-secret setup guidance.
- `tests/` — unit, contract, integration, security, and browser-facing tests.
- `docs/` — user documentation published with MkDocs.
- `spec/` — unpublished normative architecture and product contracts kept as flat numbered documents.

## Project Conventions

- Support Python 3.11 and later.
- Use `uv` for dependency management and command execution.
- Follow the existing typed, asynchronous Python style.
- Prefer explicit types and `isinstance` checks over dynamic attribute checks.
- Use Pydantic models for configuration and structured responses.
- Keep MCP-facing descriptions accurate because clients derive tool schemas from them.
- Preserve the distinction between persistent TOML settings and the environment-composited runtime view.
- Treat credential storage, allowlists, attachment paths, and HTTP transport settings as security-sensitive behavior.
- Do not log, document, or commit real email credentials, API keys, message contents, or tokens.

## Current Architecture Direction

The revised Local Email App architecture under `spec/` is the normative target
currently being implemented. MCP stdio provides bounded mail workflows; CLI and
the embedded loopback-only React UI provide the managed management plane.
SQLite owns managed configuration and a rebuildable metadata projection. On
Linux and Windows, its private `managed_secret` table is the default
`SecretStore`; macOS uses the operating-system keyring. Application
services resolve only the selected account/role secret immediately before
provider construction. Legacy TOML/environment/keyring behavior remains an
explicit compatibility mode and import source, but MCP exposes no account or
credential management in either mode. Historical `add_email_account` is removed. The optional Codex/Claude plugin
launches the current published mail-only stdio server through a shared `.mcp.json`;
its semver is independent from the Python application, while its skill hands
account and credential setup to interactive CLI/UI without receiving secrets.
Attachment compatibility preserves the caller's exact destination behind
explicit policy and filesystem defenses.
Centralized limits apply to application and serialized results. MCP Apps, remote
UI, daemon, multi-user, hard purge, and cloud-service design remain out of scope.

## Development Workflow

Install the environment and pre-commit hooks:

```bash
make install
```

Before completing a change, run:

```bash
make check
make test
make docs-test
```

During development, focused checks are encouraged, but the full relevant suite
must pass before a change is considered complete.

Useful commands:

| Command                         | Description                                                  |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `uv run mcp-email-server stdio` | Run the local stdio MCP server.                              |
| `uv run mcp-email-server ui`    | Open the account configuration UI.                           |
| `make check`                    | Run lockfile, formatting, lint, type, and dependency checks. |
| `make test`                     | Run the test suite with coverage.                            |
| `make docs-test`                | Build the MkDocs site in strict mode.                        |
| `make docs`                     | Serve the documentation locally.                             |

## Documentation Requirements

Code and documentation must remain aligned.

- Every code change must include a review and corresponding update of the relevant documentation in the same change.
- User-visible behavior changes must always update the appropriate page under `docs/`; internal changes must still keep docstrings and developer guidance accurate.
- Configuration fields or environment variables require updates to `docs/configuration.md` and, when security-sensitive, `docs/security.md`.
- CLI commands, arguments, transport defaults, or HTTP security behavior require updates to `docs/transports.md`.
- Local management UI behavior also requires review of `docs/getting-started.md`, `docs/configuration.md`, `docs/security.md`, and `docs/troubleshooting.md`; route/session/header changes always update `docs/security.md`.
- MCP tool names, parameters, responses, visibility, or workflows require updates to `docs/tools.md`.
- New special cases and operational caveats belong in `docs/guides.md` or `docs/troubleshooting.md`.
- Keep `README.md` limited to the quickest supported configuration path and links to the full documentation.
- Update `CONTRIBUTING.md` when contributor or release workflows change.
- Run `make docs-test` after changing code or documentation that can affect published docs.

## Specification Requirements

`spec/` is the repository's workspace for architecture and product design before
those decisions become stable implementation or published user behavior.

- Keep `spec/` outside the MkDocs navigation; published, implemented behavior belongs under `docs/`.
- Maintain `spec/README.md` as the global spec map and keep the current proposal's numbered documents directly under `spec/`.
- Name detailed documents `NN-topic.md` and order them from system context and boundaries toward workflows, data design, and interfaces.
- Write specs in English Markdown and use Mermaid for architecture, sequence, state, flow, and ER diagrams.
- `spec/README.md` is the sole navigation map; detailed specs do not contain `Previous`/`Next` navigation or per-document status metadata.
- Give every normative contract one owning domain spec and cross-reference that owner instead of duplicating the contract.
- End every detailed domain spec with explicit acceptance criteria.
- Centralize implementation/test/docs traceability and delivery gates in `spec/12-delivery-validation-and-evolution.md`; do not place implementation-status claims or evidence diaries in each domain spec.
- Update the owning spec before or with architecture, workflow, persistence, interface, or security-boundary changes.
- Keep unresolved product decisions explicit in the owning spec rather than hiding them in implementation plans.
- Do not describe an accepted target as shipped behavior. Treat the complete proposal as delivered only when all domain acceptance criteria and the centralized delivery matrix are complete and published docs match.

The current Local Email App specification starts at `spec/README.md`. Continue
design discussions by updating the owning numbered document and its centralized
map/verification references.

## AnyCap

This project uses [AnyCap](https://anycap.ai) for web research, web crawling,
multimodal generation and understanding, file sharing, and static page hosting.
Before using it, read the installed AnyCap skill and verify the locally installed
CLI and authentication:

```bash
anycap status
```

Submit a bug or feature request when a capability fails or is missing:

```bash
anycap feedback --type bug -m "describe the issue" --request-id <id>
anycap feedback --type feature -m "describe the use case"
```

## Windows Compatibility and Filesystem Security

- Windows is a first-class supported platform. New runtime, CLI, UI, persistence,
  attachment, spill, packaging, and documentation changes must preserve Windows
  compatibility rather than assume POSIX APIs.
- Keep platform differences behind a small typed filesystem-security compatibility
  layer. Application/domain code stays platform-neutral; do not scatter Win32,
  `fcntl`, UID, mode-bit, or no-follow branches through business workflows.
- POSIX retains owner/mode, directory-descriptor, no-follow, identity, and `fcntl`
  guarantees. Windows uses local fixed NTFS, handle-bound reparse/identity checks,
  protected DACLs, hardened `LockFileEx` locking, and write-through same-volume
  replacement. Never restore a weaker path-based fallback.
- Any filesystem-security change requires native `windows-latest` coverage on real
  NTFS for applicable symlink/junction, ACL/owner, hard-link, lock, concurrent
  replacement, crash cleanup, and atomic-write behavior; mocks alone are not proof.
- Explicitly document unsupported Windows storage such as direct volume-root
  targets, UNC/network paths, device namespaces, alternate data streams, and
  non-NTFS volumes, and fail before
  provider, authority, or secret-store effects.

## Testing Expectations

- Add or update tests for every behavior change and regression fix.
- Keep unit tests deterministic and independent of live IMAP, SMTP, or keyring services.
- Run `make test-e2e` for changes to IMAP, SMTP, MCP stdio, configuration loading, attachment handling, or mailbox mutations. This uses synthetic accounts on a loopback-only GreenMail container, and CI runs it once on the default Python version.
- Cover both successful operations and security or failure boundaries.
- When changing configuration, test TOML loading, supported environment overrides, persistence, and migration behavior as applicable.
- When changing MCP tools, test the complete catalog snapshot (names, descriptions, input/output schemas, annotations, resources, and visibility), responses, limits, and account-specific error paths.
- Web UI changes require frontend lint/typecheck/unit coverage, backend route/auth/Host/Origin/CSRF/bootstrap-replay security tests, real-browser E2E for critical flows, and shutdown checks.
- Frontend/package changes require sdist/wheel inventory checks, a wheel rebuilt from the sdist without Node, isolated-install UI smoke, and packaged-asset drift checks.
- Agent integration changes require Codex/Claude Code installation fixtures, canonical-content drift tests, version-mismatch handling, and scenarios proving credentials are handed to user-operated CLI/UI rather than chat or MCP.

## Repository Change Checklist

Keep related files synchronized:

- Dependency changes: `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`.
- Public configuration changes: implementation, tests, and `docs/configuration.md`.
- Credential or access-control changes: implementation, tests, `docs/security.md`, and troubleshooting guidance.
- MCP surface changes: `mcp_email_server/app.py`, tests, and `docs/tools.md`.
- CLI or transport changes: `mcp_email_server/cli.py`, tests, and `docs/transports.md`.
- Agent integration changes: canonical `SKILL.md`, shared `.mcp.json`, minimal vendor manifests/staged copies, independent plugin/application versioning, install/update/remove fixtures, security scenarios, and integration documentation.
- Frontend dependency changes: `frontend/package.json`, its lockfile, notices, source/build checks, and staged packaged assets.
- Web UI route/session/security changes: backend tests, browser tests, and `docs/security.md` plus affected setup/troubleshooting docs.
- Packaged asset changes: explicit sdist/wheel content assertions and Node-free from-sdist verification.
- Frontend maintainers own generated-asset synchronization: keep temporary `frontend/dist/` ignored, but commit `mcp_email_server/web_ui/static/` and `frontend/embedded-assets.json` after `make frontend`; release builds must not be the first place these assets are generated.
- Architecture, workflow, persistence, interface, or security-boundary changes: the single owning file under `spec/`, centralized delivery traceability, tests, and relevant published docs when implemented.
- Quick-start changes: `README.md`, `docs/getting-started.md`, and `mkdocs.yml` when navigation changes.
