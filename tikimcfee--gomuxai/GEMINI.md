# CLAUDE.md

You are an agent running in a tmux session. This file tells you how to coordinate with other agents.

---

## The Golden Rule

**The `agent` binary is your only interface to the outside world.**

Everything you need to do - spawn agents, send messages, read output, store state - goes through `agent`. If you find yourself wanting to do something the tool doesn't support, **STOP**. Don't hack around it. Report the limitation.

```bash
# YES - Use the tool
agent send helper "analyze this"
agent state set myname status "blocked"

# NO - Don't bypass the tool
echo "message" > /tmp/some-hack.txt  # BAD
tmux send-keys -t session "text"     # BAD - use agent keys
```

---

## Core Commands

### Spawning Agents

```bash
agent spawn <name> --backend claude [task-file]
```

**Flags:**
- `--backend <name>` - Backend to use (required). Built-in: `claude`, `aider`
- `--backend-config <file>` - Path to custom backend JSON config (alternative to `--backend`)
- `--task <name>` - Reference a task from the DB task repository (see Tasks section)
- `--skip-permissions` - Pass `--dangerously-skip-permissions` to Claude CLI

**Behavior:**
- Task file argument reads from filesystem; `--task` flag reads from DB
- The `AGENT_NAME` env var is automatically set in the spawned session
- You'll need to `send` the first message yourself (spawn doesn't auto-send)

```bash
# Spawn and give it work
agent spawn helper --backend claude
agent send helper "Read task at tasks/research.md and execute it"

# Spawn with a stored task from DB
agent spawn helper --backend claude --task research-auth

# Spawn with auto-approve (use with caution)
agent spawn auto-worker --backend claude --skip-permissions
```

### Sending Messages

**Two modes. Pick the right one.**

| Mode | Command | When |
|------|---------|------|
| Immediate | `agent send <name> "msg"` | Interrupt now, urgent |
| Queued | `agent queue <name> "msg"` | Wait until idle, polite |

```bash
# Urgent - sends immediately, may interrupt
agent send helper "STOP - there's a critical bug"

# Polite - waits for idle prompt
agent queue helper "When you're done, please review auth.go"

# Queue with explicit sender (for coordination/tracking)
agent queue helper --from coordinator "Priority task incoming"
```

**Queue flags:**
- `--from <sender>` - Sender ID. Defaults to `AGENT_NAME` env var, then "user"

**Wart:** `queue` requires `agent watch` running somewhere. If the watcher isn't running, messages sit forever.

### Reading Output

```bash
agent capture <name> --lines 100
```

Returns terminal output, ANSI codes stripped. Use `--raw` to keep them.

### Checking Status

```bash
agent status <name>
```

Returns: `idle`, `processing`, or `unknown`

**Wart:** Status detection uses regex patterns. It can be wrong. If status is `unknown`, the agent might be stuck at a prompt you don't recognize.

---

## Data Storage (All in SQLite)

Everything is in one database. No filesystem hunting.

### Tasks

Store reusable task definitions:

```bash
agent task set research-auth -f tasks/research-auth.md   # From file
agent task set quick-task "Do X, Y, Z"                   # Inline
agent task get research-auth                              # Retrieve
agent task list                                           # List all
agent task clear research-auth                            # Remove
```

Tasks exist independently of agents. Multiple agents can reference the same task.

### State (Key-Value)

Store your working state:

```bash
agent state set myname status "analyzing auth module"
agent state set myname progress "3/5 files done"
agent state get myname status
agent state list myname
agent state clear myname
```

**Use this for coordination.** Other agents can read your state:

```bash
# Helper writes its status
agent state set helper status "done"
agent state set helper result "Found 3 vulnerabilities"

# Coordinator reads it
agent state get helper status
agent state get helper result
```

**Behaviors:**
- State persists until explicitly cleared or the agent is cleaned up (cleanup deletes state and logs)
- Reading a non-existent key prints "No state found for X.Y" (not an error)

### Logs

Query captured output from DB (ANSI-stripped):

```bash
agent logs <name>                  # Last 50 entries
agent logs <name> --lines 100      # More entries
agent logs <name> --since 5m       # Since 5 minutes ago
```

### Capture vs Logs: When to Use Which

| Method | Source | Use When |
|--------|--------|----------|
| `capture` | Live terminal buffer | Need current screen state, checking prompts |
| `logs` | DB (persistent) | Need historical output, timestamped entries |

**Capture** is ephemeral - it's whatever's in the tmux scrollback right now. Good for status checks and reading recent output.

**Logs** are persistent - entries are stored with timestamps as the agent runs. Good for debugging what happened, auditing, or recovering context after the fact.

---

## Agent Identity

When an agent is spawned, the `AGENT_NAME` environment variable is set in its session. This is useful for:

1. **Self-identification** - Agent knows its own name without being told
2. **Queue sender defaults** - `agent queue` uses `AGENT_NAME` as default `--from`
3. **State namespacing** - Conventionally use your own name for state keys

```bash
# Inside a spawned agent session, AGENT_NAME is set
echo $AGENT_NAME  # "helper" (or whatever name was used in spawn)

# Queue uses it automatically
agent queue coordinator "I'm done"  # --from defaults to $AGENT_NAME
```

---

## Low-Level Tmux Control

For when you need raw terminal access.

**Naming convention:** When you spawn an agent named `helper`, the tmux session is named `agent-helper`. High-level commands use agent names; low-level commands use session names.

```bash
agent session new <name>           # Create raw session (no CLI tool)
agent session kill <name>          # Kill session
agent session list                 # List all sessions

agent keys <session> "text"        # Send text + Enter
agent keys <session> "text" --no-enter  # Send text only
agent key <session> c-c            # Send Ctrl+C
agent key <session> Enter          # Send Enter

agent clear <session>              # Clear screen + scrollback
```

**Special keys:** `Enter`, `Escape`, `Tab`, `Space`, `c-c`, `c-d`, `c-z`, `c-l`, `Up`, `Down`, `Left`, `Right`, `Home`, `End`, `PgUp`, `PgDn`, `F1`-`F12`

---

## Rules

### 1. Always Use the Tool

Don't shell out to tmux directly. Don't write to random files. Don't hack around limitations. The tool is the interface.

### 2. Report What You Can't Do

If the tool doesn't support something you need:

```bash
agent state set myname blocked "Need feature X - agent tool doesn't support it"
```

Then stop. Don't improvise.

### 3. Clean Up After Yourself

```bash
# When done with helpers
agent cleanup helper

# When cleaning up ALL your spawned agents
agent cleanup --all --as myname

# Clean up all except specific agents
agent cleanup --all --as myname --except builder,tester
```

**Cleanup flags:**
- `--all` - Clean up all agents (requires `--as`)
- `--as <name>` - Your agent name (prevents self-termination)
- `--except <names>` - Comma-separated list of agents to skip

### 4. Use State for Coordination

Don't rely on capturing output to coordinate. State is explicit:

```bash
# BAD - fragile coordination via output parsing
output=$(agent capture helper --lines 5)
if [[ "$output" == *"done"* ]]; then ...

# GOOD - explicit coordination via state
status=$(agent state get helper status)
if [[ "$status" == "done" ]]; then ...
```

**The distinction:**
- **Coordination** (signaling between agents) → Use state. Explicit, reliable.
- **Diagnostics** (understanding what's happening) → Use capture. Visual inspection, debugging.

### 5. Check Before Spawning

```bash
agent list
```

Is there already an agent doing what you need? Reuse it instead of spawning duplicates.

---

## Workflow Example

```bash
# 1. Spawn a helper
agent spawn analyzer --backend claude

# 2. Give it work
agent send analyzer "Analyze auth.go for security issues"

# 3. Let it work, check periodically
agent status analyzer  # idle? processing?

# 4. When idle, read results
agent capture analyzer --lines 200

# 5. Or check its state (if it wrote any)
agent state get analyzer result

# 6. Send follow-up if needed
agent queue analyzer "Also check session.go"

# 7. When done, cleanup
agent cleanup analyzer
```

---

## Common Patterns

### Coordinator + Specialists

```bash
# Spawn specialists
agent spawn api-analyzer --backend claude
agent spawn db-analyzer --backend claude

# Assign tasks
agent send api-analyzer "Analyze API routes, store findings in state"
agent send db-analyzer "Analyze database queries, store findings in state"

# Wait for both (poll state)
while true; do
  api_done=$(agent state get api-analyzer status)
  db_done=$(agent state get db-analyzer status)
  [[ "$api_done" == "done" && "$db_done" == "done" ]] && break
  sleep 5
done

# Collect results
agent state get api-analyzer findings
agent state get db-analyzer findings

# Cleanup
agent cleanup api-analyzer
agent cleanup db-analyzer
```

### Handoff Pattern

```bash
# Agent A finishes, signals ready
agent state set agent-a status "done"
agent state set agent-a output-file "results.json"
agent queue agent-b "Agent A is done. Read results from state."
```

---

## Warts & Limitations

| Issue | Workaround |
|-------|------------|
| `queue` needs watcher running | Start `agent watch` in background (use `--interval` to tune) |
| `status` can return `unknown` | Check state instead, or capture output |
| Spawn doesn't auto-send task | Use `send` after spawn |
| No streaming capture | Poll with `capture` periodically |
| Backend always required | Use `--backend claude` or config file |
| Watch interval defaults to 2s | Use `agent watch --interval 5s` for less frequent polling |

---

## Data Location

All data lives next to the binary:

```
.gomuxai/
└── gomuxai.db    # Everything: agents, messages, tasks, logs, state
```

Delete the folder, delete all traces. Portable.

---

## If Something Goes Wrong

### Diagnostic Steps

1. Check the agent exists: `agent list`
2. Check session exists: `agent session list`
3. Check status: `agent status <name>`
4. Capture output: `agent capture <name> --lines 200`
5. Check state: `agent state list <name>`

### Common Failure Modes and Recovery

**Agent not responding (status: unknown)**
```bash
# Check if it's actually stuck or just busy (uses agent name)
agent capture helper --lines 50

# If stuck at a prompt you don't recognize, try sending Enter (uses session name)
agent key agent-helper Enter

# If truly hung, send interrupt
agent key agent-helper c-c
```

Note: `capture` uses agent name (`helper`), but `key` uses session name (`agent-helper`).

**Session exists but agent record doesn't (orphaned session)**
```bash
# List raw tmux sessions
agent session list

# Kill the orphan directly
agent session kill agent-helper
```

**Agent record exists but session doesn't (stale record)**
```bash
# Cleanup will handle this - it checks session existence
agent cleanup helper
```

**Queue messages not being delivered**
```bash
# Check if watcher is running (it should print periodic status)
# If not running, start it:
agent watch

# Or run in background with custom interval
agent watch --interval 5s &
```

Multiple watchers can run safely - they'll just duplicate delivery checks.

**Agent spawned but CLI didn't start**
```bash
# Capture to see what happened
agent capture helper --lines 50

# Maybe the backend CLI isn't installed or PATH issue
# Kill and retry with corrected environment
agent cleanup helper
```

### When to Use Escape Hatches

The low-level commands exist for recovery:

| Situation | Escape Hatch |
|-----------|--------------|
| Need to send Ctrl+C to interrupt | `agent key <session> c-c` |
| Need to clear garbled terminal | `agent clear <session>` |
| Need raw session without agent record | `agent session new <name>` |
| High-level command failing | Drop to `agent keys` / `agent capture` |

### Reporting Blockers

If the tool errors or doesn't do what you expect, **set your state to blocked and report it**:

```bash
agent state set myname status "BLOCKED"
agent state set myname error "agent send failed with: <error>"
```

Then stop. Don't improvise workarounds that bypass the tool.

---

## Development Notes

This section explains implementation details for developers working on the tool.

### Architecture: Why Tmux?

The tool is a coordination layer over tmux sessions. Each agent runs in its own tmux session, which provides:

1. **Process isolation** - Agents can crash without taking down others
2. **Persistent terminals** - Sessions survive disconnects
3. **Scriptable I/O** - Send keys, capture output programmatically
4. **Escape hatches** - Low-level control when abstractions fail

The high-level commands (`spawn`, `send`, `queue`, `status`) are conveniences. The low-level commands (`session`, `keys`, `key`, `capture`) expose the underlying tmux operations for when you need direct control.

### Status Detection Internals

Status detection works by capturing terminal output and matching regex patterns:

**Claude backend patterns** (`internal/backend/namedagents/claude.go`):
- Idle: `^>\s*$` (prompt at line start)
- Processing: spinner chars (`⠋⠙⠹⠸⠼⠴⠦⠧⠇⠏`), "Thinking", "Using tool", "Writing to", "Reading"
- Error: "Permission denied", "Rate limit", "Error:", "API Error", "failed", "could not"

**Aider backend patterns** (`internal/backend/namedagents/aider.go`):
- Idle: `^aider>\s*$`
- Processing: "Thinking", "Working", "Applying", "Generating", "Streaming"

**Why `unknown` happens:**
- Output doesn't match any pattern (unusual prompt state)
- Capturing during transition between states
- Backend CLI changed its output format

When status is unreliable, use explicit state coordination instead.

### Custom Backend Configuration

Create a JSON file with this structure:

```json
{
  "name": "my-backend",
  "launch_command": "my-cli --some-flag",
  "init_message": "Please read {taskfile}",
  "exit_command": "/quit",
  "idle_pattern": "^> $",
  "processing_pattern": "(Working|Thinking)"
}
```

Use with: `agent spawn helper --backend-config my-backend.json`

### Database Schema

All data is in SQLite (`.gomuxai/gomuxai.db`):

- `agents` - Name, session, backend, task file, created timestamp
- `messages` - Sender, receiver, content, status (pending/delivered), timestamps
- `tasks` - Name, content, source file, created timestamp
- `state` - Agent name, key, value, updated timestamp
- `logs` - Agent name, content (ANSI-stripped), captured timestamp

---

## Remember

- **The tool is the interface.** Everything through `agent`.
- **State is for coordination.** Write yours, read others'.
- **If it doesn't work, report it.** Don't hack around.
- **Clean up.** Don't leave orphan agents.
