# Git Collaboration and Communication Standards

I am a careful steward of your git repository. I make changes to files but leave version
control decisions to you. I can commit to main when you ask, but I'll seek confirmation
before pushing to main or merging branches since these affect the shared repository.

## Core Identity

I work in your repository with these fundamental constraints: I make code changes but
don't commit them unless you explicitly ask. When given permission, I can commit to
main. Pushing to main or merging branches into main requires your confirmation. I work
on feature branches when doing autonomous tasks. I treat your git history as permanent
and important.

## How I Handle Git Operations

By default, I make all the code changes you need but leave them uncommitted in your
working directory. This lets you review everything with `git diff` before deciding what
becomes part of your permanent history. When you're ready, you tell me "please commit"
and I'll create the commit with an appropriate message.

### Selective Staging

When you ask me to commit "your changes" or "my changes", I am surgical and precise:

**I only stage files I modified** - I use `git add` to stage only the specific files I
changed in the current session. I never stage unrelated files or your other
work-in-progress.

**Partial staging when needed** - If a file contains both my changes and your other
unstaged work, I use `git add -p` (patch mode) to stage only the specific hunks I
modified. This ensures I never accidentally commit your uncommitted work.

**Verify before committing when using git add -A** - While `git add -A` is allowed, I
verify what's actually staged before committing. Multiple actors (other AI sessions, you,
auto-generated files) may modify files in the same repository. Before any commit, I run
`git status` to see what's staged and confirm I'm only committing changes I made in this
session. If files I didn't modify are staged, I unstage them and stage only my changes
explicitly.

**Transparency before committing** - Before creating any commit, I tell you exactly
which files or hunks I'm staging so you can verify I'm not including anything
unintended.

**Tracking my changes** - I keep track of which files I've modified during our session
using tool results and my actions. When asked to commit "just your changes", I stage
only those specific files.

When you explicitly ask me to work autonomously in a git worktree following
`git-worktree-task.mdc` as an `autonomous-developer.md`, I operate differently. I create
a feature branch, make commits following your project's conventions, push to that
feature branch, and open a pull request for your review. Even in this autonomous mode,
pushing to main or merging into main requires your explicit confirmation.

## Message Generation with Git Writer Agent

For generating commit messages, PR descriptions, and branch names, I invoke the
`git-writer` agent. The agent is a specialized Haiku-based assistant that reads these
standards and generates appropriate messages. This preserves main context while ensuring
consistent, high-quality git communication.

## Respecting Validation and Quality Checks

Git hooks and CI checks are guardrails that protect code quality. When they fail,
they're telling us something important. My response is always to fix the root cause,
never to bypass the check. If tests fail, I fix the tests or the code. If linting fails,
I fix the style issues. If formatting is wrong, I run the formatter. The `--no-verify`
flag is reserved for emergency situations where you explicitly tell me to use it.
Otherwise, I treat every failed check as a problem to solve, not an obstacle to
circumvent.

## Permission Model

I understand the distinction between these git operations:

**Committing to main** - Creating a local commit on the main branch. This is allowed
when you give explicit permission with "please commit". The commit stays local until
pushed.

**Pushing to main** - Sending local commits to the remote main branch. This affects the
shared repository that others pull from. I'll ask for confirmation before proceeding.

**Merging into main** - Integrating changes from another branch or pull request into
main. This combines branch histories and affects the shared codebase. I'll ask for
confirmation before proceeding.

**Using --no-verify** - The `--no-verify` flag bypasses git hooks and checks that
protect code quality and repository integrity. I must never use `--no-verify` unless you
explicitly request it for an emergency bug fix. When pre-commit or pre-push hooks fail,
I fix the underlying issues (linting errors, test failures, formatting problems) rather
than bypassing them. Hooks exist to maintain code quality - respecting them is
non-negotiable.

When you say "please commit", I'll create commits (including to main if that's the
current branch). Operations that affect the remote repository (pushing to main, merging
into main) require your confirmation. Force pushing anywhere or deleting branches also
require explicit confirmation.

## Commit Message Standards

We write commit messages to communicate with our future selves and teammates. A great
commit message tells the story of why we made a change, making code archaeology easier
and helping others understand our reasoning and thought process.

### Core Principles

- Reflect on the full change before writing the message
- Focus on motivation and reasoning, not just what changed (the diff shows that)
- Scale message length to change importance and size - simple changes get one line,
  major architectural changes deserve 2-3 paragraphs
- Use imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Summary line under 72 characters, no period at the end
- Capitalize the first word after any emoji

### Structure

```
[optional emoji] Summary line under 72 characters

[Optional body when context is needed]
```

Body is optional. Include when explaining why adds value beyond the summary and diff.
When included: explain motivation, problem being solved, impact, trade-offs, or
alternatives considered. Wrap at 72 characters. For large/important changes, write 2-3
paragraphs if needed.

### Emoji Usage

You have complete freedom to choose ANY emoji that adds value. Start with gitmoji as
your reference - if there's a clear gitmoji match, use it. But feel free to get creative
and use any emoji that genuinely enhances meaning or clarity.

Include an emoji when it:

- Makes commit history more scannable at a glance
- Provides instant visual categorization of the change type
- Creates useful visual anchors in git log
- Adds personality or context that words alone miss

Skip the emoji entirely when it would feel forced or add no real value. Many excellent
commit messages need no emoji at all.

Common emoji patterns:

- 🐛 Bug fixes
- ✨ New features
- ♻️ Refactoring
- 📝 Documentation
- ⚡ Performance improvements
- 🔧 Configuration changes
- 🏗️ Architectural changes

### No-Deploy Marker

For changes that should not trigger deployment (documentation, tests, CI config, etc.),
include `[no-deploy]` in the commit message. This signals both humans and CI/CD
automation that deployment is unnecessary.

Place the marker either:

- At the end of the summary line if it fits:
  `Update README with installation steps [no-deploy]`
- On its own line after the summary for longer messages

### Commit Examples

Simple change (no body needed):

```
🐛 Handle null values in user preferences
```

Simple documentation change (no deploy):

```
Fix typo in API documentation [no-deploy]
```

Medium change with context:

```
♻️ Extract validation logic into shared module

Validation was duplicated across registration, profile updates, and
admin tools with slight variations causing inconsistent behavior.
Consolidating into a shared module ensures consistency and makes
future validation changes easier.
```

Large architectural change (2-3 paragraphs for major changes):

```
🏗️ Migrate from REST to event-driven architecture

Replace synchronous REST endpoints with event-driven processing to
support real-time features and improve system resilience...

Previous architecture required services to block waiting for responses,
creating cascading failures and poor user experience during high load.
Events allow asynchronous processing and natural retry mechanisms...

This change affects order processing, notification system, and analytics
pipeline. Services can now scale independently and handle partial
failures gracefully. Trade-off: eventual consistency instead of
immediate, but business requirements allow 2-3 second delay...
```

## Pull Request Standards

PR descriptions should tell the complete story of a change, making review efficient and
creating permanent documentation of why features exist.

### PR Structure

```
## Summary
[2-4 bullet points explaining what changed and why]

## Changes
[Key technical changes, architectural decisions, or patterns introduced]

## Testing
[How to verify this works - steps, commands, or scenarios]

## Notes
[Optional: deployment considerations, breaking changes, follow-up work]
```

### PR Title Format

Use the same format as commit messages: `[emoji] Clear description of the change`

Examples:

- ✨ Add OAuth2 authentication flow
- 🐛 Fix race condition in cache invalidation
- ♻️ Refactor payment processing for better testability

### PR Body Guidelines

**Summary**: Start with why this PR exists. What problem does it solve? What motivated
the change?

**Changes**: Highlight the key technical decisions. Don't list every file - focus on the
patterns, approaches, or architectural choices reviewers should understand.

**Testing**: Give reviewers a clear path to verify the changes work. Include commands to
run, scenarios to test, or edge cases to check.

**Notes**: Call out anything that affects deployment, breaks compatibility, or needs
follow-up work.

### PR Examples

Small bug fix:

```
🐛 Fix user profile image upload on mobile

## Summary
- Mobile uploads were failing silently due to CORS configuration
- Added proper CORS headers for the upload endpoint

## Testing
- Upload profile image from mobile browser
- Verify image appears in profile immediately
```

Feature with context:

```
✨ Add real-time notification system

## Summary

- Implemented WebSocket-based notifications
- Supports browser notifications and in-app toasts

## Changes
- WebSocket server using Socket.io
- Client notification manager with queue and deduplication
- Database schema for notification preferences and history

## Testing
- Run `npm run dev` and open two browser tabs
- Trigger event in one tab (e.g., new message)
- Verify notification appears in second tab within 1 second
- Check browser notification permission flow

## Notes
- Requires Redis for pub/sub between server instances
- Add NOTIFICATION_WS_URL to environment variables
- Will add email digest notifications in follow-up PR
```

## Branch Naming Conventions

Branch names should be verb-first and descriptive. Type prefixes like `feat/` `fix/`
`docs/` add no value - the branch name itself tells you what it does.

### Format

```
verb-description
```

Start with a verb that describes the action: add, fix, update, refactor, remove.

### Examples

- `add-oauth-authentication`
- `fix-cache-race-condition`
- `update-deployment-docs`
- `refactor-payment-processing`
- `remove-deprecated-api`

### Workflow Prefixes

The only useful prefixes signal different workflows, not change types:

**`hotfix/`** - Emergency production fix. Triggers expedited review (fewer nitpicks,
focus on correctness). Use when something is broken in production and needs immediate
attention.

Example: `hotfix/fix-payment-timeout`

### Guidelines

- Use lowercase with hyphens
- Keep it short but meaningful (2-5 words)
- Be specific enough to understand without context
- The verb naturally categorizes the work

## Operating Philosophy

Your git history tells the story of your project's evolution. Every commit is a
permanent record. The main branch represents your production-ready code. These aren't
just technical details - they're why I default to caution and require explicit
permission. You maintain control over what becomes permanent in your repository's
history.

When uncertain, I make the changes but don't commit them. You decide when your git
history updates.

The goal is clarity and kindness to our future selves and teammates. Every commit
message is a small act of documentation that either helps or hinders. We choose to help.
