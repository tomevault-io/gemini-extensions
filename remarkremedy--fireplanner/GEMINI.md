This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Singapore FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) + Property + Investment Retirement Planner. A fully client-side web application for comprehensive retirement planning tailored to Singapore residents.

**Status:** Shipped. Fully client-side app deployed to Cloudflare Pages. Monte Carlo simulation (Web Worker), 12 withdrawal strategies, historical backtesting, sequence risk stress testing, dashboard, property analysis, scenario save/load, Excel/JSON export, and reference guide.

**Remaining gaps:**
- Property hybrid MC overlay (5 discrete weighted property scenarios per MC path)
- Scenario side-by-side comparison view (save/load works, parallel compare panel does not exist)

**Deployment:** Cloudflare Pages via `wrangler pages deploy`. No server. Sentry and PostHog intentionally skipped (privacy-first, no-server-contact promise).

**Source of truth:** When the master plan (`FIRE_PLANNER_MASTER_PLAN_v2.md`) and this file conflict, the master plan wins for calculation logic, formulas, Singapore-specific rules, and domain requirements. This file wins for technology choices, architecture decisions, and implementation patterns.

## Architecture

### Frontend
| Dependency | Version |
|-----------|---------|
| React | 19.x |
| TypeScript | 5.9.x |
| Vite | 7.x |
| React Router | 6.x |
| Zustand | 5.x |
| React Query (TanStack Query) | 5.x |
| Tailwind CSS | 3.4.x |
| shadcn/ui | latest |
| Recharts | 2.x |
| D3.js | 7.x |
| Zod | 3.x |
| TanStack Table | 8.x |

**Routing:** React Router v6 with `createBrowserRouter`. Route components live in `pages/` as plain components (e.g., `InputsPage.tsx`). Do NOT use Next.js file-based routing conventions (`page.tsx`, `layout.tsx` in nested folders).

**State:** 7 Zustand stores (profile, income, allocation, simulation, withdrawal, property, ui). Dashboard metrics are **derived hooks**, not a store — the dashboard owns no state, it computes views from other stores.

### Simulation Engine (Web Worker)

All heavy computation (Monte Carlo, backtest, sequence risk, SWR optimization) runs in a Web Worker (`lib/simulation/simulation.worker.ts`) to avoid blocking the UI. No backend server required.

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `lib/math/linalg.ts` | Cholesky decomposition, covariance matrix, matrix ops |
| `lib/math/random.ts` | SeededRNG (xoshiro128**), Box-Muller gaussians |
| `lib/math/stats.ts` | Percentile, Student-t quantile |
| `lib/simulation/monteCarlo.ts` | 10K MC simulations (parametric/bootstrap/fat-tail) |
| `lib/simulation/backtest.ts` | Bengen-style rolling window historical backtest |
| `lib/simulation/sequenceRisk.ts` | Crisis scenario stress testing |
| `lib/simulation/swrOptimizer.ts` | Binary search for safe withdrawal rate |
| `lib/simulation/simulation.worker.ts` | Web Worker message handler |
| `lib/simulation/workerClient.ts` | Worker client + strategy params flattening |
| `lib/exportExcel.ts` | Client-side Excel export via exceljs |
| `lib/data/historicalReturnsFull.ts` | 98 rows historical returns (1928-2025) |

### Data Persistence (Browser-Only)

All user financial data stays in the browser. No server-side storage of user data.

- **localStorage:** All Zustand store state auto-saved on change via `zustand/middleware` persist. Restored on page load.
- **JSON export/import:** Users can download their full state as a JSON file and restore it on any device/browser. This is the cross-device portability mechanism.
- **URL params:** Life stage, FIRE type, and view state encoded in URL for bookmarking and sharing specific views.
- **No authentication.** No accounts. No server-side anything.

```

Use `Glob` or `ls` to discover specific files. The router (`router.tsx`) defines all routes; legacy paths like `/profile`, `/income`, `/monte-carlo` redirect to consolidated pages.

## Computation Architecture

All computation is client-side. Heavy computations (Monte Carlo, backtest, sequence risk, SWR optimization) run in a **Web Worker** (`lib/simulation/simulation.worker.ts`) to avoid blocking the UI. Lightweight computations (FIRE number, tax, CPF, income projections, portfolio stats, deterministic withdrawal strategies, property analysis) run on the main thread for instant feedback.

### Web Worker Communication

The 3 simulation hooks (`useMonteCarloQuery`, `useBacktestQuery`, `useSequenceRiskQuery`) call worker functions from `workerClient.ts` instead of API endpoints. `workerClient.ts` manages a lazy singleton Worker instance with message ID multiplexing for concurrent calls. `useMutation` from TanStack React Query is retained for `isPending`/`error`/`data` state management.

### Withdrawal Strategies

The 12 withdrawal strategies are implemented in TypeScript (`lib/calculations/withdrawal.ts`) and used by both the deterministic comparison view and the simulation engines (MC, backtest, sequence risk). There is one implementation — no cross-language parity concern.

### Rebalancing

All simulations (MC, backtest, sequence risk) use **annual steps**. The rebalancing frequency option in the UI (Annual/Semi-Annual/Quarterly) is informational — it does not change simulation granularity. Historical return data is annual, and sub-annual rebalancing has negligible impact on long-term outcomes. Do not implement sub-annual simulation steps.

## Validation Layer

Validation runs **before** any calculation. Invalid inputs must not propagate through the store dependency chain.

### Per-Store Validation (Zod schemas in `lib/validation/schemas.ts`)
Each store has a Zod schema defining valid ranges. Examples:
- `currentAge`: integer, 18-100
- `retirementAge`: integer, > currentAge, <= lifeExpectancy
- `lifeExpectancy`: integer, > retirementAge, 50-120
- `swr`: number, 0.01-0.10
- Allocation weights: array of 8, each 0-1, sum === 1.0
- `annualExpenses`: number, > 0
- `inflation`: number, 0-0.15

### Cross-Store Validation (in `lib/validation/rules.ts`)
Rules that span stores:
- Retirement age (profile) > current age (profile)
- Life expectancy (profile) > retirement age (profile)
- Allocation weights (allocation) must sum to 1.0 before portfolio stats compute
- Income streams end ages (income) <= life expectancy (profile)
- Withdrawal strategy params (withdrawal) validated against portfolio size (profile)

### Error Propagation
- Each store exposes a `validationErrors` field (map of field name to error message)
- Calculation hooks check upstream store validity before computing: if profile store has errors, income projections return `null` with an error flag
- Components display inline validation errors on inputs and show a warning banner when downstream calculations are blocked by upstream errors
- Simulation runs are gated: Monte Carlo button is disabled with tooltip explaining which inputs need fixing

## Key Domain Concepts

- **8 asset classes:** US Equities, SG Equities (STI), Intl Equities (MSCI), Bonds, REITs, Gold, Cash, CPF (OA+SA blend)
- **12 withdrawal strategies:** Constant Dollar (4% rule), VPW, Guardrails (Guyton-Klinger), Vanguard Dynamic, CAPE-Based, Floor-and-Ceiling, Percent of Portfolio, 1/N (Remaining Years), Sensible Withdrawals, 95% Rule, Endowment (Yale Model), Hebeler Autopilot II
- **3 salary models:** Simple (fixed growth), Realistic (career phases + promotion jumps), Data-Driven (MOM benchmarks)
- **Monte Carlo methods:** Parametric (multivariate normal via Cholesky), Historical Bootstrap, Fat-tail (Student-t df=5)
- **All values in SGD.** USD-denominated assets converted at user-specified or historical FX rates.
- **Singapore-only.** All tax, CPF, property, and regulatory logic is Singapore-specific. No multi-country support. Data files in `lib/data/` are structured as standalone modules (e.g., `taxBrackets.ts`, `cpfRates.ts`) so future locale support could swap implementations, but do not build abstraction for it now.

## Singapore-Specific Logic

All Singapore-specific values live in `lib/data/` files, never hardcoded in calculation functions.

- **CPF:** Contribution rates vary by age bracket (up to 55: 37% total; 55-60: 34%; 60-65: 25%; 65-70: 16.5%; >70: 12.5%). Under-55 has 4 sub-brackets for OA/SA/MA allocation. OW ceiling $8,000/month (from Jan 2026), AW ceiling formula. Extra interest on first $60K (extra 1% on first $30K OA, extra 1% on next $30K across OA/SA/MA). BRS/FRS/ERS projections with 3.5% annual growth.
- **Tax:** SG progressive income tax (0% on first $20K up to 24% above $1M). Personal reliefs (earned income, NSman, spouse, child, parent, CPF, SRS). SRS deduction cap $15,300/yr.
- **Property:** Bala's Table for leasehold decay, BSD rates (1% on first $180K, 2% on next $180K, 3% on next $640K, 4% on next $500K, 5% on next $1.5M, 6% on remainder), ABSD rates by residency/property count, 75% LTV.
- **CPF LIFE:** Estimated payout rates ~5.4% (Basic) / ~6.3% (Standard) of FRS at 55.

## Testing Strategy

### Frontend: Vitest
Unit tests for every calculation module in `lib/calculations/`, `lib/simulation/`, and `lib/math/`. Each `.ts` file has a corresponding `.test.ts`. Property-based tests use `fast-check` for invariants (FIRE number > 0, allocation sums to 1.0, tax <= income, etc.). Validation tests cover Zod schemas and cross-store rules.

### Integration Tests
3 user journey scenarios in `lib/integration.test.ts` with concrete expected values derived from master plan formulas:
1. **Fresh Graduate** (age 25, $48K income, Aggressive 80/20, SWR 3.5%)
2. **Mid-Career Professional** (age 35, $180K income, Balanced 60/40, SWR 4%)
3. **Pre-Retiree** (age 55, $2M portfolio, Conservative 30/70, SWR 4%)

### Coverage Requirements
- `lib/calculations/`: 95% line coverage minimum
- `lib/simulation/`: 90% line coverage minimum
- `lib/math/`: 90% line coverage minimum
- `lib/validation/`: 90% line coverage minimum
- All tests must pass before committing

## Do Not

- **Do not use `any` type** in TypeScript calculation functions. All inputs and outputs must be typed.
- **Do not hardcode Singapore-specific values** in calculation functions. CPF rates, tax brackets, ABSD rates, Bala's Table data — all go in `lib/data/` files.
- **Do not use `Math.random()`** for Monte Carlo. Use `SeededRNG` from `lib/math/random.ts` for deterministic, reproducible simulations.
- **Do not call simulation functions on the main thread.** Always use the Web Worker via `workerClient.ts`.
- **Do not use Next.js conventions.** No `page.tsx` / `layout.tsx` nested folder routing. This is React Router v6 with Vite.
- **Do not create a dashboard Zustand store.** Dashboard metrics are derived hooks that read from other stores. `useUIStore` handles UI-only state (active section, nudges), not dashboard data.
- **Do not add a backend server** for computation or user data storage. All financial computation runs client-side. Browser-only persistence for user data. **Exception:** Two Cloudflare Pages Functions exist for lead capture:
  1. `POST /api/email-signup` — email address, source tag, and feature interest (general signups)
  2. `POST /api/expense-tracker-signup` — email, expense tracking status, primary device, source surface, copy variant, page path, and submission timestamp (expense tracker early access)
  Both use D1 storage with rate limiting. No financial data leaves the browser.
- **Do not skip validation.** Every calculation hook must check input validity before computing.
- **Do not import from one store inside another store's definition.** Cross-store reads happen in hooks and components, not in store definitions.
- **Do not mix dollar bases in views OR computation.** When a table, chart, or comparison shows values across multiple columns/series, ALL values must be in the same dollar basis (all today's dollars OR all future/nominal dollars). If one column is inflation-adjusted to a future date, every other monetary column must be too. Project portfolios forward at expected net return, inflate expenses at the inflation rate, over the same time horizon. **The same rule applies to computation:** this codebase has two computation contexts — (1) year-by-year simulation engines (projection.ts, MC, SR) that work in **nominal terms** and inflate everything at each timestep, and (2) steady-state FIRE metrics (`computeMetrics` via `calculateAllFireMetrics` + `projectPortfolioAtRetirement`) that work in **real terms** using `netRealReturn = expectedReturn - inflation - fees`. Never copy inflation logic from a nominal-context engine into a real-context model, or vice versa. The disruption preview lump sum bug (Mar 2026) was caused by importing `lumpSum * (1+i)^years` from the MC engine (nominal) into `computeMetrics` (real), over-estimating the impact by up to 45%.
- **Do not change the calculation engine without updating the display layer, or vice versa.** Tax deductions, CPF contributions, and other auto-computed values appear in both the engine (`lib/calculations/`) and UI summary panels (e.g., `TaxReliefSection`'s "Auto-calculated deductions"). When adding, removing, or modifying a deduction or parameter in one layer, update the other in the same commit. The RSTU bug (Feb 2026) was caused by the engine correctly deducting SA top-ups from chargeable income while the UI panel never displayed or totalled the deduction.
- **Do not deploy to production without explicit user approval.** Only deploy to production when the user explicitly says "deploy to production". The word "deploy" alone is not sufficient — it must specifically reference production. Preview/branch deployments for testing are fine without approval, but production deploys require an unambiguous go-ahead.

## Coding Conventions

These conventions reduce ambiguity for AI agents and maintain consistency across the codebase.

### Zustand Store Access
Use **selector functions** when reading from stores in components. Existing code may still use full-store subscriptions — migrate when touching those files, but don't refactor solely for this.
```typescript
// GOOD — subscribes only to fields used
const currentAge = useProfileStore((s) => s.currentAge)
const swr = useProfileStore((s) => s.swr)

// BAD — subscribes to everything, re-renders on any change
const store = useProfileStore()
const { currentAge, swr } = useProfileStore()
```

### Form Inputs
Always use the shared input wrappers from `components/shared/` instead of raw `<Input type="number">`:
- `<CurrencyInput>` for dollar amounts
- `<NumberInput>` for plain numbers
- `<PercentInput>` for percentages

These handle cursor-jump prevention, comma formatting, blue border convention, and validation error display.

### Shared Helpers (canonical locations)
| Pattern | Canonical Location | Do NOT |
|---------|-------------------|--------|
| Projection params | `buildProjectionParams()` in `hooks/useIncomeProjection.ts` | Build params inline |
| CPF housing mode | `deriveCpfHousingFromProperty()` in `hooks/useIncomeProjection.ts` | Derive inline |
| Effective returns/stdDevs | `getEffectiveReturns()` / `getEffectiveStdDevs()` in `lib/calculations/portfolio.ts` | `ASSET_CLASSES.map(...)` inline |
| Expenses at retirement | `getExpensesAtRetirement()` in `lib/calculations/expenses.ts` | `getEffectiveExpenses() * Math.pow(...)` inline |
| Withdrawal strategy colors | `WITHDRAWAL_STRATEGY_COLORS` in `lib/chartTheme.ts` | Define colors locally |
| DeltaBadge (good/bad indicator) | `components/shared/DeltaBadge.tsx` | Define inline in components |

### File Organization
- **Pure functions** belong in `lib/`, not `hooks/`. If a function doesn't call React hooks, it's not a hook. Known exception: `buildProjectionParams` and `deriveCpfHousingFromProperty` live in `hooks/useIncomeProjection.ts` for co-location with the hook that uses them — do not move these, but do not add new pure functions to `hooks/`.
- **Data arrays and constants** belong in `lib/data/`, not `hooks/`.
- **JSX-free files** should use `.ts`, not `.tsx`. Only use `.tsx` in `components/` and `pages/`.
- **Import paths:** Always use `@/` aliases without file extensions. Exception: Web Worker imports in `lib/simulation/` use explicit `.ts` extensions for module compatibility.

## Development Commands

```bash
cd frontend && npm install
npm run dev          # Vite dev server (http://localhost:5173)
npm run build        # Production build
npm run lint         # ESLint
npm run type-check   # tsc --noEmit
npm run test         # Vitest (run all tests)
npm run test:watch   # Vitest in watch mode
npm run test:coverage # Vitest with coverage report
```

### Before Committing
1. `npm run type-check` passes with zero errors
2. `npm run lint` passes
3. `npm run test` passes (all tests green)
4. `lib/calculations/` coverage >= 95%
5. No `any` types in calculation or simulation files
6. No hardcoded Singapore-specific values outside `lib/data/`

### Git Remotes and Branching

This repo uses two GitHub remotes to separate public (open-source) from private (unreleased) work:

| Remote | Repo | Visibility | What gets pushed |
|--------|------|------------|-----------------|
| `origin` | `RemarkRemedy/fireplanner` | **Public** | Bugfixes only |
| `private` | `RemarkRemedy/fireplanner-private` | **Private** | Everything (full backup) |

**Workflow:**
- **Bugfixes:** commit on `main`, push to both remotes (`git push-both` alias)
- **New features:** branch off `main`, push to `private` only (`git push private feat/my-feature`). Do NOT push feature branches or feature merges to `origin`.

**No new features go to `origin` until further notice.** The public repo receives bugfixes only. All feature work stays on `private`. This includes merging feature branches into `main` — after merging a feature, push `main` to `private` only, not `origin`.

## UI Patterns

- **Live calculations:** Every input change recalculates client-side metrics instantly (no submit button for simple metrics).
- **Explicit run for heavy computation:** Monte Carlo and Backtest require a manual "Run" button with progress indicator. Show computation time on completion.
- **Progressive disclosure:** Basic mode shows essentials (age, income, expenses, net worth). Advanced toggles reveal income streams, life events, CPF details, correlation matrix, custom return overrides.
- **Color coding convention:** Blue = user input, Black = formula/computed, Green = linked from another store/section.
- **Smart defaults:** Pre-filled with Singapore defaults (age 30, $72K income from MOM degree median, $48K expenses, 2.5% inflation, Conservative template for Post-FIRE users).
- **Tooltips:** Every label has an (i) icon. Hover shows definition + formula.
- **Scenario save/load:** Save current state as named scenario, up to 5 named scenarios stored in localStorage under `fireplanner-scenarios` key. Implemented as a utility module (`lib/scenarios.ts`), not a store. Side-by-side comparison panel is not yet built.
- **Mobile-first responsive:** Dashboard cards stack vertically, charts resize with container, sidebar becomes bottom nav on mobile.

## Historical Data

Sources, licensing, gap handling, and data format details are in [`docs/data-sources.md`](docs/data-sources.md). CPI values are decimal fractions (0.025 = 2.5%), NOT percentages.

## Annual Data Maintenance Checklist

Every January, review and update these data files with the previous year's published values:

| File | What to Update | Official Source | Typical Publish Date |
|------|---------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| `lib/data/cpfRates.ts` | OW ceiling, contribution rates, BRS/FRS/ERS base values, `RETIREMENT_SUM_BASE_YEAR` | [CPF Board](https://www.cpf.gov.sg) | January |
| `lib/data/taxBrackets.ts` | Tax brackets, relief amounts, SRS caps | [IRAS](https://www.iras.gov.sg) | February (Budget) |
| `lib/data/momSalary.ts` | Salary benchmarks by education/age | [MOM Stats](https://stats.mom.gov.sg) | June (Labour Force Report) |
| `lib/data/healthcarePremiums.ts` | MediShield Life, ISP, CareShield premiums, `MEDISAVE_BHS` | [CPF Board](https://www.cpf.gov.sg), [MOH](https://www.moh.gov.sg) | April |
| `lib/data/stampDutyRates.ts` | BSD brackets, ABSD rates | [IRAS](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/stamp-duty) | When revised (check Budget) |
| `lib/data/historicalReturnsFull.ts` | Add new year's data row, update `DATA_YEAR_RANGE` | [Damodaran](https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/), [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org) | January |
| `lib/data/sources.ts` | Sync `period` labels with updated files above | N/A | After any data file update |

After updating any data file:
1. Update the header comment with new download date
2. Run `npm run test` — existing tests catch regressions
3. Update `sources.ts` period labels to match
4. Add an entry to `lib/data/changelog.ts` describing what changed (include `affectedSections`)
5. Bump `DATA_VINTAGE` in `lib/data/changelog.ts` to today's date
