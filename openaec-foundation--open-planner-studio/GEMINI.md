# AGENTS.md

Compact guide for AI agents working in this repo. The canonical deep-dive is
[`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) — read it before non-trivial work. This file captures
only what an agent would otherwise get wrong.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev          # Dev launcher (scripts/dev-server.mjs) — per-worktree fixed port, refuses double start
npm run build        # tsc --noEmit && vite build → dist/  ← main static check
npm run tauri:dev    # desktop app via scripts/tauri-dev.mjs (picks first free port ≥3007)
npm run tauri:build  # desktop installers
npm run bump X.Y.Z   # CalVer sync (package.json + tauri.conf.json; Cargo.toml stays 0.1.0)
npm run verify       # THE gate — literally what CI, the release gate and the deploy gate run
npm run typecheck    # tsc --noEmit over src/ AND scripts/+tests/ (tsconfig.tests.json)
npm test             # all four behavioral suites
bash tests/planning/run.sh cases-<x>.json  # one battery
```

- **No lint script and no formatter.** `tsc` is the static gate; `tsconfig.json`
  is `strict` with `noUnusedLocals` + `noUnusedParameters`, so dead code and
  unused params fail the build.
- **`npm run verify` is one definition, in `package.json`** — ci.yml, the
  release gate and the deploy gate all run that single line, so what passes
  locally is exactly what passes in CI. It covers typecheck + `npm test` +
  `verify:examples` + `verify:docs` + `verify:i18n`.
- Four behavioral suites behind `npm test`: `tests/planning/` (data-driven
  CPM/calendar cases + `check-*.ts` contract tests, headless on Node via
  esbuild), `tests/library/`, `tests/mcp/`, and `tests/dev-server/` (`node:test`
  + an integration script). Run the planning suite after touching anything in
  `src/engine/scheduler/`, `src/engine/calendar/`, or the `runCPM` action.
- Node 22 (see CI). Rust stable required only for `tauri:*` commands.
- New user-visible strings go through `t(...)` in all fourteen locales;
  `npm run verify:i18n` checks that, CLDR plural categories included.

## Architectural facts that bite

- **IFC 4.3 is the native file format, not a sidecar.** Load = parse via
  `src/services/ifc/ifcReader`; save = serialize whole state via `ifcWriter`.
  There is no JSON project format. Any new domain data (tasks, sequences,
  resources, assignments, calendar) must round-trip through the IFC layer or
  it is lost on save/reload. CSV/MS Project/P6 services are import/export
  adapters, not the source of truth.
- **The Gantt is Canvas 2D, not DOM.** Bars, dependencies, timescale and
  hit-testing live imperatively in `src/engine/renderer/` (`GanttRenderer`).
  React only owns surrounding chrome (ribbon, panels, dialogs, status bar).
  Change visual Gantt behavior in the renderer, not in components.
- **One Zustand+Immer store, composed of slices.** `src/state/appStore.ts`
  spreads slice-creators from `src/state/slices/`; each slice is typed
  (`AppSlice<XSlice>`) against the **full** `AppState`, so cross-slice
  actions (runCPM, undo/redo, file I/O) mutate the whole draft. Add new
  state/actions to the matching slice.
- **New project data goes in `DOCUMENT_FIELDS`** (`src/state/documentContract.ts`)
  — one descriptor list stating, per field, where it lives in the live state, its
  fresh default, and its role in the undo snapshot. `capturePayload`/
  `hydratePayload`/`freshPayload` walk that single list, so capture and hydrate
  cannot diverge, and a `DocumentPayload` field missing from the list is a
  **compile error**. `snapshot.ts` derives the undo snapshot from it,
  `transaction.ts` wraps the mutate ritual, `ifcSaveInput.ts` picks the
  round-trip fields for an IFC save. Skip this and your field silently dies on
  document switch, undo, crash recovery and save.
- **Scheduling is manual, not reactive.** `runCPM` instantiates
  `CalendarEngine` + `CPMSolver` inline and writes computed fields back via
  Immer. It does **not** re-run on edit — trigger it explicitly (F5, ribbon
  Calculate, menu, after IFC load). Editing tasks without `runCPM` leaves the
  schedule stale.
- **Undo/redo is snapshot-based.** Mutating actions push a full `Snapshot`
  before mutating.
- **Multi-document is single-active.** Top-level state is one document;
  `documentSlice` keeps the rest as `DocumentPayload` snapshots and swaps on
  switch/new/close. App-global state (most of `ui`, `taskClipboard`) is not
  swapped — that's how copy/paste works across documents.

## Tauri / web-build guard

```ts
const isTauri = () => '__TAURI_INTERNALS__' in window;
```

- Anything importing `@tauri-apps/*` must be **dynamically imported inside an
  `isTauri()` branch** (or otherwise guarded). Top-level Tauri plugin imports
  break the web build (`dist/` is a real production deploy, not just dev).
  Since v2026.7.11 the browser build does its own file I/O (File System
  Access API on Chromium, download-fallback elsewhere) and auto-save
  recovery (IndexedDB) — only the in-app updater is Tauri-only.
- **Rust backend is thin.** File I/O funnels through `src/services/fileAccess/`
  (runtime-dispatched: Tauri `plugin-fs`/`plugin-dialog` vs web File System
  Access API, unified via a `FileRef` model), not `invoke`. The only
  `invoke()` in `src/` is `install_kind` in
  `src/services/updater/updaterService.ts`. When adding file operations,
  extend `fileAccess` — not a Rust command.
- Enabled plugins: fs, dialog, shell, store, os, updater, process,
  clipboard-manager. App id `org.openaec.planner`.

## Conventions

- Path alias **`@/` → `src/`** (in both `vite.config.ts` and `tsconfig.json`).
  Use it consistently.
- **Working language is Dutch** for code comments, commit messages, and the
  canonical source translations. User-facing strings must go through `t(...)`
  (never hard-code) — 14 locales in `src/i18n/`; `ar` and `fa` are RTL.
- Settings persist to **`localStorage` under `ops-`-prefixed keys**
  (`src/utils/settingsStore.ts`). `@tauri-apps/plugin-store` is a dependency
  but **unused** — do not reach for it for settings.
- Project auto-save runs in **both** Tauri and browser: **throttled to 10 s** in
  `src/hooks/useAutoSave.ts` (a throttle, not a debounce — a debounce would only
  write 10 s after the *last* edit and so widen the data-loss window during a long
  editing session), one IFC snapshot per open document via
  `src/services/recovery/recoveryStore.ts` (Tauri: `appDataDir`; web:
  IndexedDB), keyed by worktree instance slug.
- **`public/docs/` is a documentation subsystem with its own CI gate** — 27
  articles × 14 languages plus a manifest, feeding the in-app help viewer
  (Backstage → Help) and the generated GitHub wiki (`npm run publish:wiki`;
  never hand-edit the wiki). Articles render through a *limited* Markdown subset
  (`src/utils/miniMarkdown.tsx`): no tables, no blockquotes, no h4, no raw HTML,
  and only `docs://`/`examples://` links. `npm run verify:docs` enforces all of
  that. A user-visible feature needs an article (at minimum `nl` + `en`) or it is
  undiscoverable.

## Worktrees (how concurrent dev instances coexist)

- Worktrees live under `.claude/worktrees/`. `vite.config.ts` explicitly
  ignores that path (anchored to `__dirname`) so a dev server here doesn't
  blow past `fs.inotify.max_user_watches` watching sibling worktrees.
- `scripts/tauri-dev.mjs` picks the first free port ≥3007 and derives a slug
  from the worktree directory name; the desktop window's `devUrl` and the
  auto-save recovery filename both follow it. Multiple worktrees can run
  `tauri:dev` at once without clobbering each other.

## Self-test harness

- Dev-only hook `window.__OPS__` (installed by `src/utils/devBridge.ts`:
  store, log-bus, `extensions.*`) against the **browser** dev build.
  Prefer asserting via store state over canvas pixels. Details in
  [`docs/self-test-harness.md`](docs/self-test-harness.md).

## Key paths

| Concern | Location |

| Store composition root | `src/state/appStore.ts` |

| Canvas renderer | `src/engine/renderer/` |
| IFC read/write | `src/services/ifc/ifcReader`, `ifcWriter` |
| File I/O (Tauri↔web) | `src/services/fileAccess/` (+ `recentFiles.ts`) |
| Auto-save / recovery | `src/services/recovery/recoveryStore.ts` |
| Rust commands (thin) | `src-tauri/src/commands/mod.rs` |
| Tauri config | `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` |
