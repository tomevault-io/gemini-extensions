# AGENTS.md — authoring LoopFlow (`.loop`) flows

This file teaches an AI assistant (Claude Code, Copilot, Cursor, etc.) how to write
**LoopFlow** flows. When a user asks you to design a staged, self-correcting, or human-gated
coding workflow — "set up a loop to fix X", "turn this epic into a pipeline", "automate
this multi-step task" — author a `.loop` file using the grammar below, then let the user
run it with `loop-run run file.loop`, or in Claude Code via `/loopflow run file.loop`.

A `.loop` declares a goal, the context to read, the allowed actions, the verification
(`done when`), and the stopping rules. This file is the complete grammar plus the
authoring procedure.

## When to write a `.loop`

Write one when the work is a *repeatable, verifiable* loop or a sequence of them:
bug fixes with a test, refactors gated by a check, an epic broken into stories, a
migration with a verification step. Don't write one for a one-off question or a trivial
edit — just do those directly.

Before building a loop, run the four-condition test — build one only when all four hold:

1. **Does the task repeat?** A one-time task is just a normal prompt.
2. **Is there a clear definition of "done"?** You must be able to verify completion — a
   `done when` predicate (a test, a command, or a review skill). No check, no loop.
3. **Can you afford the iterations?** A loop re-prompts itself until done; that costs tokens.
   Keep the `done when` check fast and add an `after N tries` thrash guard.
4. **Does the loop have the tools to verify itself?** It needs a way to implement *and* check
   its own work — the predicate command or the review skill must actually be runnable.

**Interview the user before writing it.** Walk the five decisions, asking the
high-leverage questions and offering defaults for the rest: (1) the **goal**;
(2) the **`done when`** check (test / command / scan finds-nothing / human);
(3) **`look at`** context; (4) the **action policy** (what's risky enough to gate);
(5) **stopping** (reflect on failure + an `after N tries` guard). Then the
**human gates** and the **git strategy** (default: branch + commit when done,
never push to `main`; ask if they want a PR or a worktree). Offer the defaults
inline so a confident user can accept everything at once.

### Start from a template when one fits

This repo ships a library of **best-practice starter loops** in [`templates/`](./templates/)
(see [`templates/README.md`](./templates/README.md)). When the user's request matches one,
**reach for it first** — copy it, fill in its `# TODO` lines (test commands, paths), and
adapt — instead of authoring from a blank file. They cover the everyday jobs —
`bugfix.loop`, `feature.loop`, `load-spec.loop` (deliver an existing backlog), and more;
the index is [`templates/README.md`](./templates/README.md).

Each is heavily commented and verified to parse. Still interview the user for the specifics
(goal, the real `done when`, what to gate) — the template is the skeleton, not the answer.

## Vocabulary (the whole language)

```
loop "<name>":            a self-correcting loop
pipeline "<name>":        a sequence of stages (an epic)
stage "<name>":           one stage of a pipeline (its body is a loop; a story)
flow "<name>":            a chain of loop files (each step runs a whole .loop file)
  run "<file>":           first step — runs the file; its text result is passed forward
  then run "<file>":      subsequent step — receives the previous result as context
    a human approves first  (optional per-step human gate before the step runs)
  with the result of <name>  (reference a named step's output instead of auto-carry)
  for each <var> in "<file>":  iterate items from a .yaml or .md file; run the template once per item
    run "<template>":     template receives the item text as context; fail → ask continue/stop

goal: <text>              what "done" means, in plain language
done when <predicate>     how the loop verifies itself (see Predicates)
look at: <files>, and the last failure   context the agent reads before acting
allow edits automatically, but ask me before <classes>   action policy
each cycle: plan, then act, then observe   the repeated steps (any subset, in order)
also: <pass>, <pass>      extra finishing passes run after the goal is met
use skills: <a>, <b>      named skills the loop may invoke during plan/act
remember in "<file.md>"   cross-run memory: read lessons on start, append an outcome on stop
reflect                   turn a failure into context for the next plan (the back-edge)

when it passes and the goal is met: stop
when it fails: reflect on <focus>, then plan again
when blocked: ask a human
after <N> tries: stop and warn "<message>"

a human approves the plan first        (human authors/approves the plan before acting)
a human reviews before stopping        (human judges the result before the loop stops)
a human approves before <action>       (a blocking gate before a stage, e.g. deploy)

plan from "<file>"        (read the plan from a file you control instead of generating it)

use the <method> method   schedule: <when>   runner: <agent>   target: <dir>   (config tier)
models: fast <model>, strong <model>   model tiering: plan/reflect/also→fast, act→strong (cascades; override e.g. `act fast`, `all strong`)
each cycle: plan, then act, then observe   (config tier: the default cycle for every loop in the file; a loop's own `each cycle:` overrides it)
rigor: vibe coding | structured ai-assisted | agentic engineering   (the spectrum dial; structured/agentic give every loop a back-edge + thrash guard for free)
mode: conductor | orchestrator   (supervision posture: in-session/sync vs async/opens-a-PR)
runs as: <identity>   (an auditable principal for unattended runs)
observe:   (config-tier block) trace every cycle / meter tokens and cost / stop and warn if cost exceeds "$N"
sandbox:   (config-tier block) no network access / allow egress to "host" only / cap cpu at … memory at … time at …
hooks:     (loop body block) before each cycle | after act | on commit | on stop : "<cmd>" passes|finds nothing   (a failing hook blocks)
examples: <files>      (reference patterns to imitate — context engineering's 6th part)
knowledge: <files>     (read-only reference the agent must not edit)
use tools from the "<server>" server   (MCP: name servers whose tools the loop may use)
stages in parallel:    (inside a pipeline: the indented stages run concurrently)
```

### Predicates (`done when …`)

```
done when the test "billing.spec.ts::apostrophe" passes   # a named test
done when "pnpm test" passes                               # a shell command, exit 0
done when "semgrep --severity=high" finds nothing          # a shell command, empty output
done when "pnpm test flaky" passes 3 times                 # flake guard: re-run the check, EVERY run must pass
done when a human confirms "looks right at 375px"          # a human check
done when the skill "email-review" approves                # an eval: approved / not
done when the skill "email-review" scores 8 or more        # an eval: numeric threshold
done when the skill "code-review" approves by 3 judges     # consensus: N independent verdicts, majority wins
done when the skill "api-review" scores 8 or more on the output       # an eval of WHAT was produced
done when the skill "path-review" approves on the trajectory          # an eval of HOW the agent got there
  the bar: didn't weaken a test to go green; no writes outside api/   # the rubric the judge scores against
```

The command in a predicate runs in the user's shell with their privileges (like an npm
script). It IS meant to be a real command. Prefer a fast, deterministic check.

**Flake guard — `passes N times`.** Re-runs the check `N` times; every run must pass (first
failure short-circuits). Use when a green can pass by luck.

**Judge panel — `by N judges`.** Collects `N` independent verdicts on a skill predicate and
takes the majority (early-exit once decided). Use for LM judgments near the bar.

### Tests vs evals — list as many `done when` as you need

A loop may have **multiple `done when` lines, and ALL must pass** (a conjunction). Use this to
combine the two kinds of verification:

- **TESTS** — a `test` / command predicate. Deterministic, checked by code (`"pnpm test" passes`,
  `"semgrep …" finds nothing`).
- **EVALS** — a `skill` predicate. A rubric / LM judge for the non-deterministic parts. An eval
  names its **subject**: `on the output` (the default — judges *what* was produced) or
  `on the trajectory` (judges *how* the agent got there — the path and tool calls it took). An
  indented `the bar:` line states the conditions the judge scores against.

A trajectory eval is what catches the failures a green test can't — e.g. an agent that made a test
pass by weakening it. Pair a test with an eval when "done" means both "it works" and "it was built
the right way."

### `use skills` — coordinate proven skills

Instead of one giant prompt, a loop can name skills it may call while planning and acting:

```loop
loop "decide whether to cancel the morning run":
  goal: a clear go / no-go call the runner trusts
  use skills: check-weather, analyze-workout
  done when the skill "workout-review" approves
```

This is **skill-driven development**: build and battle-test each skill on its own first,
then have the loop coordinate them. Don't invent a loop around skills that don't exist yet —
prove the skill manually, then wire it in (as an execution skill via `use skills:`, or as a
verifier via `done when the skill "…" approves`). See `examples/skills_memory.loop`.

### `remember in` — cross-run memory

A loop forgets everything between runs unless you give it a memory file. `remember in` makes
the loop read the file's lessons into its first plan and append a dated outcome entry when it
stops — so it improves run over run instead of repeating mistakes.

```loop
loop "...":
  goal: ...
  remember in "morning-run.memory.md"
```

`reflect` is *within-run* memory (a failure feeds the next plan); `remember` is its
*across-run* counterpart. The file is plain markdown — readable and editable by a human.

### `flow` — chaining loops across files

A `flow` sequences multiple `.loop` files. Each step runs the whole file (plan→act→observe
cycle) and passes its text result forward as context for the next step. The chain is
fail-fast: a step that ends unsatisfied stops the rest.

```loop
flow "ship":
  run "build.loop"
  then run "test.loop"
  then run "deploy.loop":
    a human approves first
```

- `run "<file>"` — first step; the file path is relative to the flow file.
- `then run "<file>"` — subsequent steps; automatically receive the previous step's text summary.
- `a human approves first` — optional per-step gate; blocks until approved.
- `with the result of <name>` — reference a named step's output explicitly instead of auto-carry.

### `for each` — iterate a plan, run a template per item

Inside a `flow`, `for each` reads a list from a YAML or Markdown file and runs a template
once per entry. The entry's text becomes the template's context (what to build).

```loop
flow "deliver":
  for each item in "plan.yaml":
    run "item-template.loop"
```

- `for each <var> in "<file>":` — source must be a `.yaml` file (a list or a single-key
  list like `items:`) or a `.md` file (splits on `## ` sections).
- `run "<template>"` — the template runs once per item; the item text arrives as context.
- A failed item pauses the flow and asks whether to continue with the next item or stop.
- Method-neutral: works with any checklist, not only BMAD. See `examples/foreach/` for a
  generic bundle and `examples/bmad/atoz/` for BMAD as one example method.

## Rules

- **Indentation matters.** `loop` / `pipeline` / `flow` at column 0; their body indented
  two spaces; a `stage`'s body indented under the stage.
- A `loop` needs a `goal`. A `pipeline` needs at least one `stage`.
- **An epic → a `pipeline`; each story → a `stage`.** Stages run in order; a failing
  stage halts the rest.
- **Scope each loop with `look at:`** so the agent follows the existing architecture and
  makes the smallest change, instead of writing greenfield code. Items can be exact file
  paths or plain-language descriptions (e.g. `the billing form`) — the agent resolves
  descriptions to the actual files before planning.
- **Put human gates on risky work** — payments, migrations, deploys, anything
  irreversible. Use `ask me before …` for action policy, `a human approves before …`
  for a hard stage gate.
- Quote every shell predicate and every file path exactly (`done when "pnpm test cart" passes`) —
  the command runs verbatim in the user's shell; a paraphrased command is a loop that can never
  go green.
- Output only valid `.loop` syntax. Comments start with `#`.
- **Friendly shorthands** (all desugar to the lines above — use freely): `check:` / `verify:`
  = `done when` (a bare value is a shell command; a predicate phrase parses as-is); `in:` /
  `look in:` / `files:` / `context:` = `look at:`; `when it breaks` = `when it fails`;
  `when it gets stuck` = `when blocked`.

## Example — a single loop

```loop
loop "fix billing apostrophe bug":
  goal: settings save when the company name has an apostrophe
  done when the test "billing.spec.ts::apostrophe" passes

  look at: billing/form.tsx, api/settings.ts, schema/settings.ts, and the last failure
  allow edits automatically, but ask me before migrations or pushes

  each cycle: plan, then act, then observe
  when it passes and the goal is met:  stop
  when it fails:                        reflect on which layer broke, then plan again
  when blocked:                         ask a human
  also:                                 polish the code, run a security check
  after 6 tries:                        stop and warn "thrashing"
```

## Example — an epic with stories

```loop
pipeline "epic: checkout v2":

  stage "story: cart totals":
    goal: cart shows correct totals with tax
    look at: src/cart/, src/tax/
    done when "pnpm test cart" passes
    each cycle: plan, then act, then observe
    when it fails: reflect, then plan again

  stage "story: checkout submit":
    goal: order submits and payment is captured
    a human approves before charging the card
    done when "pnpm test checkout" passes
    each cycle: act, then observe
```

## Git strategy

A `git:` block sets the version-control strategy for the whole file (config tier, before
any definition) or for a single loop (inside the loop body).

**Built-in default (no `git:` block):** work on a branch, commit when the goal is met,
no push. This applies whenever no git block is present at any level.

### Line forms

```
work in place                    # edit the current branch as-is
work on a branch                 # create / switch to a feature branch (default)
work on a branch "my-feature"    # explicit branch name
work in a worktree               # isolated git worktree
work in a worktree "my-worktree" # named worktree

commit when the goal is met      # one commit on success (default)
commit each cycle                # commit after every cycle
commit each story                # commit after each stage
commit never / do not commit     # no automatic commits

push when done                   # push the branch on completion
do not push                      # no push (default)

open a pull request              # open a PR after pushing
```

### Cascade (lowest wins)

1. Built-in default — branch + commit-when-done, no push.
2. File-level `git:` block — applies to all loops in the file.
3. Per-loop `git:` block — refines commit cadence for that loop only.

A `use the <method>` preset may carry a `git:` block at file level; the file's own block
overrides it.

### Always-on safety

- **Never push to `main` or `master`.** This is unconditional — no `git:` block can
  override it. A `push when done` directive with the current branch being protected is an
  error that surfaces before the loop runs.
- **`work in place` + `push when done` on a protected branch** is also an up-front error.

## Config defaults & the project config file

Anything in the **config tier** (the top of the file, before any definition) sets a default for
every loop in that file — so you write it once instead of repeating it per loop. The most common
repeater is the cycle:

```loop
each cycle: plan, then act, then observe   # the default for every loop below
models: fast haiku, strong opus

pipeline "epic: ship it":
  stage "story: build":
    goal: it builds
    done when "pnpm build" passes            # no `each cycle:` — inherits the default
  stage "story: verify":
    goal: tests pass
    each cycle: act, then observe            # overrides just this stage
    done when "pnpm test" passes
```

### `loop.config` — defaults for the whole repo

To avoid repeating config across *files*, drop a **`loop.config`** (or `.looprc`) at your project
root. It is written in the same config-tier syntax — `each cycle:`, `models:`, a `git:` block — and
the runner reads it before every run, walking up from the `.loop` file to find it. It is the
**lowest** tier of the cascade, so a file's own config (and a per-loop directive) overrides it.

```loop
# loop.config — applies to every .loop in the repo
each cycle: plan, then act, then observe
models: fast haiku, strong opus
git:
  work on a branch
  commit when the goal is met
```

**Cascade (lowest wins):** `loop.config` → a file's config tier → a per-loop directive.
The same rule already governs `git:` and `models:`.

### Cost control

Cap spend at the config tier:

```loop
observe:
  meter tokens and cost
  stop and warn if cost exceeds "$5"
```

Pair with `models: fast haiku, strong opus` so plan/reflect run on the cheap model and only
`act` uses the strong one.

## Show the flow — every time it changes

Whenever you create or edit a `.loop`, run `loop-run show file.loop` — it prints the flow AND
doubles as your parse check (if it errors, fix indentation first: blocks at column 0, bodies
two spaces). Or render the compact ASCII yourself: the cycle, the `↺` reflect back-edge,
`✓ done when`, `⛔` thrash guard, `👤` gates. `loop-run ls` lists every loop in the repo.

## Running what you wrote

- `loop-run run file.loop` — execute on Claude Code (or `/loopflow run file.loop` in-session).
- `loop-run show file.loop` / `loop-run ls` — the shape / every loop in the repo.
- Everything else — `--log`, `--resume`, `viz`, `explain`, `live`, redaction, resume
  semantics — is in `docs/MANUAL.md` §4.

### Live visual — opt-in via `loop.config`

The in-session dashboard is **off by default**. Before running in-session, read `loop.config`
at the repo root: only `live=true` starts the dashboard; with `live=false` or no config, run
normally in the chat — don't open anything, don't ask. (Headless `loop-run run <file> --live`
is independent of this config.) Event protocol: the `/loopflow` skill's cheat-sheet.

## Authoring checklist

1. `loop-run show file.loop` parses clean and shows the shape you meant.
2. The `done when` command was run by hand at least once — a check that can never pass loops
   forever.
3. `look at:` ends with `and the last failure` — reflect's diagnosis reaches the next plan
   only if you pass it in.

### If a loop thrashes

When `after N tries` fires: (1) run the `done when` command by hand; (2) tighten `look at:`
to fewer files; (3) split the goal into stages; (4) add `remember in "<file>.memory.md"` so
the next run starts from the lessons instead of repeating them.

## Authoring order — write the lines in this order

**The finish line first, the safety net last.** Four zones, top to bottom (the file reads
in the order a run degrades — promises first, failure handling last):

1. **Contract** — `goal:`, then `done when` immediately under it. Write the check *before
   any behavior* (loop engineering's TDD): if the check can't be written, the goal isn't
   understood yet. Everything below serves this line.
2. **Boundaries** — `look at:` (scope), then `allow …, ask me before …` (power), then any
   human gate. Capability lines (`use skills`, `remember in`, `knowledge:`, `plan from`)
   belong here too.
3. **Engine** — `each cycle:` (plus `also:` finishing passes).
4. **Safety net** — `when it fails:` (the back-edge), `when blocked:` (the escape hatch),
   `after N tries:` (the floor) — in escalation order. **The last line of a loop is its
   hard stop.** Never emit a reflect back-edge without a try ceiling.

The same order applies inside every `stage`. Blank lines between zones are encouraged.
