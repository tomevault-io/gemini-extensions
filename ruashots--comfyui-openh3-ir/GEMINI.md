# Working on the OpenH3-IR node pack

**This document is for changing the node pack.** Read it before changing anything. It is the set of
rules that are not preferences, a map of which file owns what, the ComfyUI frontend behaviour that
was measured rather than assumed, and how to prove a change is really live in a running ComfyUI.
There is no install path here, on purpose: that is README.md beside this file.

The compiler is the other half and it is another repository, `open-h3-ir`. This pack depends on the
published package and carries no copy of it: a compiler bug is fixed and released there, and nothing
here changes for it. Its own maintainer document is `AGENTS.md` in that repository, and the rules
about writing briefs, prompts, validators and evaluation all live there.

## The two things to hold your work against

```bash
pytest tests                                   # from the repository root, and the path matters
.venv/bin/python research/contract_falsification.py
```

**`pytest tests`, never a bare `pytest`.** This repository's root IS the pack, so it holds an
`__init__.py`, and ComfyUI Manager clones it into `custom_nodes` under a name with hyphens in it.
pytest turns any directory holding an `__init__.py` into a Package and imports that file before
running anything below it, and it names the module by walking up while each folder is a Python
identifier -- which `ComfyUI-OpenH3-IR` is not. So it imports as a bare `__init__` with no parent
package and the first relative import raises, in every test. `tests/pytest.ini` puts the rootdir
inside `tests`, which only takes effect when the path handed to pytest is inside it, and
`conftest.py` at the root turns the other invocation into one sentence. Measured on pytest 9.1.1;
neither `--import-mode=importlib` nor `consider_namespace_packages` nor `--ignore` avoids it.

The test count is not pinned here, because it moves every time anyone adds a test and a stale number
reads as a regression.

**The tests need `open-h3-ir` installed**, at or above the release `requirements.txt` names. Some of
them read the contract that package publishes and compare it to the copies this pack ships, which is
the whole point: it holds this pack against the released compiler rather than against a working tree
nobody has.

## What the README leads with

The owner's words, 2026-08-23, and they are the pitch rather than a description:

> no more copy pasting prompts from a chat with an llm, no more explaining in what slot a resource
> is so the llm can name it right, no more explaining what a resource contains, OpenH3-IR takes
> care of that directly in comfy

Every clause of that is a thing this pack actually removes, so none of it is a claim anybody has to
soften:

- **The copy and paste.** The compiler writes the brief. Nobody carries text back from a chat window.
- **Naming a slot so a model gets the label right.** Labels are computed in the compiler's `plan.py`,
  never asked for. That is rule one of the codebase and it is why the labels are always right.
- **Explaining what a file holds.** The reference pictures and clips are read through the language
  model, so a person says `@carguy` and nothing else.
- **Leaving ComfyUI to do any of it.** The compiler runs in the same Python ComfyUI runs.

Written down here because the README gets its final pass after the Main node lands, and a pitch the
owner said once in a message is the sort of thing that gets lost between now and then.

## Where things are

The repository root is the pack. That is not a layout preference: ComfyUI Manager clones a repository
straight into `custom_nodes` and imports the cloned directory's top level, so anything one folder
deeper produces zero nodes and no error anybody can act on.

The ComfyUI pack in the repository root is eight Python files plus a `web/` folder of five JS files. Exactly one of them names `h3ir`, and every one of those imports is inside a function. Two files are generated; both say so at the top:

| file | what it owns |
|---|---|
| `h3ir_client.py` | the service protocol, the option lists, the report, and the refusal sentences BOTH compile paths use. No ComfyUI, no torch, no third-party packages, no `h3ir`. |
| `compiler.py` | running the compiler in this Python: is it installed, what does it publish, which language model writes, does that model see, and the compile itself. **The only module that imports `h3ir`.** |
| `media.py` | tensors and mappings to files on disk, content-addressed. No ComfyUI at module scope. |
| `nodes.py` | the four node schemas -- Main, Media, Setup and the optional Director -- the model loaders and the socket-to-file mapping. This is the only file that needs a canvas. |
| `contract.py` | the snapshot of the contract this pack was built against, `Half` (which compiler this graph uses and what to call it), and the decision about what a difference costs: what stops a queue, what is a line in the report. |
| `contract.json` | GENERATED. `h3ir contract` wrote it. The snapshot the file above reads. |
| `web/contract.data.js` | GENERATED. `h3ir contract --js` wrote it. The seven profiles, the camera table and the cap, for a panel that has to draw with nothing running. |
| `web/director.js` | the Director panel. It imports the three above rather than declaring them. See below. |
| `web/setup.js` | the Setup panel. Two named groups, a bottom row, and the three controls that answer back. |

**ComfyUI saves a node's widget values as a POSITIONAL list.** Measured on a saved workflow in a real
install, not assumed: `OpenH3IRSetup` reads back as `["http://127.0.0.1:8420", "<ref2va file>", ...]`
with no names anywhere. So a new input added in the middle of a schema silently shifts every value
after it in every workflow anybody has saved, and a checkpoint pick becomes a VAE pick with nothing
on screen to say why. **New inputs go on the end of `define_schema`, always.** That is why the two
newest fields on the Setup node, which are also the two most important ones, are last in the list.
The panel in `web/` lays them out however it likes; the order in the schema is what the bare canvas
falls back to and what every saved file depends on.

**Media, Director and Setup each carry a DOM board; Main is a widget node** the theme draws, with
`prompt.js` putting an @ picker over its sentence. All of it is decoration in the strict sense: each
node's real state is ordinary widget values. Media and Director edit ONE string each -- the tray's
JSON and the direction's -- and Setup edits the ten widgets it already had, keeping the five file
pickers as real combos underneath so ComfyUI still validates them. Delete `web/` and every node still
works, still API-drives and still restores from a saved workflow, with the values visible as
themselves.

**The Director's stored directions are the pack's only piece of state outside a graph, and they are
deliberately outside the compiler.** They are files in ComfyUI's own per-user store,
`user/default/openh3ir/directors/<name>.json`, each holding exactly the two keys the node's field
holds, written and deleted through the `/userdata` routes ComfyUI already serves. The compiler's
service was the other candidate and it lost on three counts: it may be on another machine or down,
which would empty the list exactly when somebody is writing in it; it would have needed new write
routes on a service that binds `0.0.0.0`; and none of it buys anything a graph needs, because **a
graph carries the words, never a pointer to a name**. Nothing in `nodes.py`, `h3ir_client.py` or the
service knows the store exists, and that is the property to keep: delete `web/` and every stored
direction becomes irrelevant rather than missing.

**The seven that ship are a SEED, not a menu**, and that is the owner's shape: "just preload the
list with them, they should be able to be removed too." On first use `director.js` writes them into
that store as ordinary directions, and from then on the list is simply what the store holds. There
is no shipped category, no protected name, and no branch anywhere that recognises one — which is
what makes rename and delete work on them with no special case, and `tests/test_director_panel.py`
pins `DIRECTORS` to exactly two readings in the file, its declaration and the seed. **Seeding is
keyed on the FOLDER not existing**, because that is the only state meaning "never used": deleting
every direction leaves the folder, so a removed one stays removed. Deleting the folder by hand is
therefore the documented way to get the seven back, and the only way, on purpose.

`OpenH3IRDirector` takes one input, `profile`, and hands down one `H3IR_DIRECTOR` bundle. Main's
`director` socket is optional, and a graph without the node steers exactly as it always has. **That
absence is the default and it is load-bearing**, so anything that makes the node's presence matter to
a graph that does not have one is a bug. There is no `none` on it for the same reason: the node IS
the choice, and unplugging it is the absence of the only one rather than a third state.

### The Setup panel

`web/setup.js`. Five rules on it are not preferences, and each has a defect planted for it in the
falsification run.

**The panel never guesses an address, and a dropped node makes no network call at all.** It once
offered four addresses people commonly run a language model on and checked them the moment a node
was dropped. A port is configurable, so that was four guesses, confidently wrong for anybody who
changed one, and it was the only thing in the pack that reached the network without being asked.
Both are gone, along with the caret that opened the list, the `use it` button and the four messages
that served them. `tests/test_setup_panel.py::test_a_fresh_node_makes_no_network_call_at_all` reads
every call site of the two language model routes and holds them to the two methods a person presses.

**The top field is `endpoint` and the bottom one is `runs at`.** The panel's own messages say
endpoint in every one of them, so the label was the one place disagreeing with the rest of it. It is
never "openai endpoint": somebody running Ollama on their own machine reads that as needing an
account with OpenAI. That fact lives in the group's quiet line, where it is a fact about a protocol
rather than a claim about who you buy from.

**`server` empty means here and an address means there, and that IS the control.** The bottom row's
control was two rows, `in this ComfyUI` and `on another machine`, and they were never a pair: the
first is a complete answer, the second is the beginning of a question, and clicking it could not
change anything because there is no third thing to set. One labelled field replaced them, with a
line under it that changes with the state and a `clear` drawn only while there is something to
clear.

**Every field carries a label drawn inside its own row.** A placeholder is gone at the first
keystroke and the field is anonymous from then on. The grey address in the address field is an
EXAMPLE; the word `address` beside it is the label. The guard reads the row as a balanced expression
rather than searching the whole file, because the weaker version passed while the address label was
deleted: the same word labels a field in the bottom row's control.

**The credential is never a widget value.** Widget values go into the saved workflow and into the
graph inside every rendered video, and people share workflows by dropping a picture into a chat. It
lives in `user/default/openh3ir/llm/keys.json` and `compiler.endpoint_key` reads it from there, so
the test and the real compile take the same path to the same credential. Measured on the canvas: with
a key set, neither the serialized workflow nor the API-format prompt contains it. The guard checks
WHAT is written to a widget, not which widget: the first draft only looked at the widget's name and
planting `this.w.llm_model.value = key` walked straight past it.

**`installed` is read before `ok`.** The vision route answers `installed: false` together with
`ok: false`, so a panel that reads `ok` first paints a red "vision off" about a model nobody asked.

**The user cannot drag the height, and the height is not a constant.** Those are two different
things and the first is the one the design asks for. The three quiet lines under the headings reflow,
so the content is a different height at every width: 442 at 520 and 481 at 430, and 495 at 430 with
the longer "compiling elsewhere" lead. A single constant has to be the largest of those, which leaves
53 pixels spare at the width the node opens at. A draft parked them above the two headings and they
read as a hole in a finished panel. `fit()` measures instead, so the board is tight at every width
and `onResize` still puts back whatever it last measured.

**`fit()` asks for `needs + chrome` and never for a correction to its own last request.** Setting the
node's size makes the frontend lay the widget out again, which comes straight back into `fit`, so
anything that adds to its own last number compounds. Measured: a draft that did walked the node to
minus fourteen hundred pixels in four frames. `chrome` is what the frontend's wrapper keeps out of
whatever a DOM widget is given, 16 pixels on the version this was measured against, and it is learned
each pass rather than written down.

**No backtick may appear inside the CSS block.** It is one template literal, so a pair in a comment
ends the string and the file stops parsing. Measured: it took the whole panel off the canvas and
`node --check` passed the file. Importing the module is what catches it.

### The routes a panel can ask

`web_api.py` registers five on ComfyUI's own server. Two are the media tray's; three are for the
Setup node's panel, and all three report rather than decide -- nothing in them writes a widget, and
the node re-resolves everything at queue time from the values on the canvas.

| route | what it answers |
|---|---|
| `POST /openh3ir/upload` | one dropped file onto the tray, and what to show for it |
| `GET /openh3ir/probe` | whether a file a saved tray names is still on this machine |
| `GET /openh3ir/compiler` | `state` is `ok`, `absent` or `broken`, the version, and what the environment would give |
| `POST /openh3ir/llm/models` | `{url}` in; liveness, every id, `choose_from`, and `also_known_as` out |
| `POST /openh3ir/llm/vision` | `{url, model}` in; `ok` true, false, or **null** out |

Three things about those three that are not obvious and are each a measured fact.

**`choose_from` is shorter than `ids` on a real vLLM, and WHICH name survives is a stated rule.**
`--served-model-name` publishes one set of weights under several ids and gives every entry the same
`root`. Offering both would be the panel inventing a decision, and the person picking one has no way
to know the two are the same file. `compiler.one_name_per_checkpoint` groups by `root` and keeps the
first id in the group whose `id` is not its own `root` -- that id is a name somebody typed into
`--served-model-name`, where `root` is only where the weights came from. Nothing named means nothing
to prefer, and there the server's own order stands. Where entries carry no `root`, as on Ollama,
every id is its own model, which can only offer more choice and never merge two that really are two.

**The survivor is always an `id` and never a `root`, and that is correctness rather than taste.**
Whatever a person picks goes straight back to the server as `model`. A `root` is not promised to be
a name the server answers to: vLLM sets it from the model path, so a server started from a local
directory has a filesystem path there with no route behind it. `also_known_as` maps each survivor to
the names it stands in for, so a panel can say so beside the row instead of leaving somebody to
wonder where the id they typed last week went.

**`ok` on the vision route has three values and `null` is not a failure.** No model list on any of
these servers reports vision, so sending a picture is the only way to find out, and a request that
comes back refused is not automatically an answer about vision. Measured against a live vLLM: asking
about a model the endpoint does not serve answers `HTTP 404: The model does not exist`, and the first
draft of that route reported it as "it cannot read a picture, pick one with a vision tower". Somebody
reading that goes looking for a vision model to replace one that was never there. Only 400, 415 and
422 produce a verdict now; 404, 401, 403 and everything else answer `null` and say what really
happened.

**Everything in them that touches a network runs off the event loop.** ComfyUI serves its whole
frontend from one aiohttp loop and the compiler's client is blocking `httpx`, so calling it inline
would freeze the canvas -- for everybody on that server -- for as long as a language model takes to
answer. `run_in_executor` is what keeps a slow endpoint a slow button rather than a hung ComfyUI.


## What crosses to the compiler, and how drift is made loud

The compiler publishes a contract and this pack holds a snapshot of the one it was built against.
The section below is the shared half of both maintainer documents: the compiler's copy says the same
things from the other side, and neither repository can test the other's. Read it before changing
anything either half can see.

the compiler's `h3ir/contract.py` is the compiler's statement of everything a client has to agree with it about,
and it is the answer to a problem the two halves of this repository are about to have: they ship to
two audiences, they are two repositories, and a test that opens the other half's source file and
reads it as text cannot exist.

**The pack IS an all-in-one, and IN-PROCESS is the ordinary case.** A ComfyUI user installs the pack,
points it at their own language model, and works: no service to start, no port, no second process.
The compiler runs in the same Python ComfyUI runs, out of the installed `open-h3-ir`. HTTP stays for
a compiler on another machine and is no longer the normal way in. The two are still installed
separately and still drift, which is exactly why the contract is not an HTTP thing -- in-process
there is no round trip to reveal a mismatch at all.

**One field on the Setup node decides which, and there is no fallback between them.** Empty means
here; an address means there. `contract.the_compiler` turns that field into a `Half`, which carries
what to call that compiler, how to ask it what it takes, and what a person does to update it. Every
sentence in `differences()` is written off that object, because the same difference has two fixes and
a message telling a ComfyUI user to restart a service they never started is the wrong-message failure
this pack exists to prevent.

**The language model's address is on the node now.** It used to be `H3IR_LLM_URL` on a service, and
there is no service to set it on. The environment variable still works for somebody who exports it
before ComfyUI starts, and the report says so when a value came from there, because a setting nobody
can see on the canvas is one somebody spends an afternoon looking for. Which model is settled on the
pack's side rather than left to the compiler, for the same reason: the compiler's own refusal to
guess between several models names an environment variable, and this pack's names a field.

**Read off the authority wherever there is one.** The roles come from `Role`, the profiles and the
camera table from `director.py`, the ceilings from `grid.py` and `shots.py`. Two lists are literals
and both are pinned by `the compiler's `tests/test_contract.py`` from this side, where the thing they describe is
importable: the wire field names, which live on pydantic models `contract.py` may not import because
a client runs it inside ComfyUI's Python; and the refusal codes, which are raised across two files.

**`CONTRACT_VERSION` is not the package version**, and `test_the_version_moves_when_any_part_of_the_contract_moves`
holds a digest of every section against it. Changing a director's prose without bumping it is a red
test. That is the whole ceremony and it is what stops the number becoming one nobody maintains.

**An unknown field is refused, never dropped.** `AssetIn` and `BriefIn` set `extra="forbid"` and a
handler turns that into `code: unknown-field` naming the key. pydantic's default is to ignore it,
and that default cost this project a real bug: see below.

#### The seven directors are still written down twice, and the copy is now generated

`h3ir/director.py` is the authority. `web/contract.data.js` carries the copy, for the reason
it always did -- the pack may be talking to another machine, and a text box that needs a running
service before it can show you a paragraph is empty exactly when somebody is trying to write in it.

What changed is that nobody types the copy. `h3ir contract --js` writes that file, `director.js`
imports `DIRECTORS`, `CAMERA_MOVES` and `MAX_NOTES` from it, and
`tests/test_contract_drift.py::test_the_generated_copies_are_what_this_compiler_publishes`
regenerates both copies and compares them byte for byte. So the instruction that used to be here --
*editing `h3ir/director.py` is not finished until `director.js` says the same words* -- is now:

```bash
h3ir contract       > contract.json
h3ir contract --js  > web/contract.data.js
```

Eleven thousand characters of prose maintained by hand in two languages is drift with a schedule.
That test runs here, against the `open-h3-ir` this pack depends on, which is a better comparison
than a sibling working tree: it holds this pack against the released compiler. Regenerating means
having a compiler installed and running the two commands above from the repository root.

#### Assert about the payload, never about the source text

Two of the three cross-boundary tests were guarding the wrong hop, and one of them had been wrong
for its whole life. a test in the compiler's suite asserted that `nodes.py` contains the line
`extra["replaces"] = slot.replaces` and that `AssetIn` declares a field called `replaces`. Both were
true. In between them, `h3ir_client._asset_facts` copied four keys out of `extra` into the request
and this was not one of them.

So the words a user typed to say who a picture takes over from never left the machine. The panel
collected them, `check_swaps` refused a swap that named nobody, the service declared the field, and
the compiler knew what to do with it -- and what the user got was the compiler refusing a question
they had already answered, or a swap bound to whoever the analyser happened to find in three sampled
frames. The test was green throughout, because it compared two pieces of source text and never
looked at the request.

`h3ir_client.payload_shape` runs the very functions that build the request and reports what comes
out. Anything asserting about what crosses uses that. A description of a payload taken from anywhere
else can be true while the payload is wrong.

#### Asking the compiler that is actually going to do the work

Two ways to get the live contract, and the choice is the caller's:

| where the compile happens | how to ask |
|---|---|
| the same Python, from the installed package | `compiler.installed_contract()` |
| a service on another machine | `h3ir_client.fetch_contract(server)` |

**Never merge them or fall back from one to the other.** Reading the local package's contract while
compiling against a remote service compares this machine's version to another machine's work, and
refuses graphs that are fine. `contract.the_compiler` picks one to match the compile path and hands
back a `Half` that can only ask that one.

The test that guards this used to assert that the string `installed_contract(` was absent from
`nodes.py`, which was true right up until the node legitimately needed both. It watches now: both
sources are replaced with counters and each half is driven for real. A check on source text cannot
tell "calls the wrong one" from "mentions the right one", and this repository has already shipped one
test that read source text and was green while the thing it guarded was broken.

**The compiler import is lazy, and stays lazy.** The old rule was "the pack imports nothing from
`h3ir`", which was right while the nodes only spoke HTTP and is wrong for an all-in-one. What
replaces it is narrower and still load-bearing: no `h3ir` import at module scope anywhere in the
pack, and exactly one function that does it at all. ComfyUI takes a pack whose import raises off the
menu entirely; a pack driving a remote compiler needs no local package; and the compiler brings
fastapi, uvicorn, pydantic and tiktoken, which have no business being pulled into ComfyUI's Python
on every start for a graph that may never compile. `installed_contract` answers None for absent,
broken and half-installed alike, because a client never fails on the CHECK.

#### The in-process path builds the brief itself, and that choice is tested rather than argued

Measured, with fastapi and pydantic blocked: every compiler module imports except `service.py`.
That one holds `_to_brief`, the only conversion from a request into a `Brief`, and the eleven
refusals it raises along the way -- role resolution, the unknown-role message, the soundtrack
pairing, the upload checks.

So there were two options and both cost something. Reuse that conversion and fastapi comes into
ComfyUI's Python with it. Build `models.Brief` and `models.AssetRef` directly and the field names
are checked by Python at call time, which is loud and free, but `role_stated` and the pairing rules
become the caller's to get right -- and `role_stated` is silent when it is wrong, because mode
inference reads it.

**The second was taken, and here is what decided it.** Most of `_to_brief` is about uploads, and an
in-process compile has none: the files are on the same disk, because this pack put them there. What
is left is small enough to state, this pack states every role explicitly so `role_stated` is always
true for it, and the unknown-role refusal is pre-empted by the contract check. Measured on this
checkout: `import h3ir.compile` costs 0.06 seconds and loads none of fastapi, uvicorn, pydantic or
tiktoken, so all four stay installed and never loaded.

**What replaces the argument is a test.** `tests/test_in_process.py` runs one request through both
conversions -- `service._to_brief` and `compiler.brief_from_payload` -- and compares the two briefs
field by field, for every job a picture can have and for a graph with nothing in the tray. fastapi
is absent from a user's ComfyUI and present in this repository's test environment, which makes this
the one place both can run side by side. `_as_the_service_answers` is held against
`service.get_prompt` and `service._envelope` the same way.

**`ROLE_OF_THE_FIELD_LISTS` is published in the contract for this reason**: the field lists describe
a `POST /v1/briefs` request and NOT the dataclasses, and the two are similar enough to be mistaken
for each other by somebody working on the all-in-one.

**An unknown key is refused on this path too.** `_BRIEF_KEYS` and `_ASSET_KEYS` in `compiler.py` are
the in-process spelling of `extra="forbid"`, and they exist because pydantic's silent drop cost this
project a real bug once. A conversion that read the keys it knows and ignored the rest would put
that bug straight back on the path that has no wire to catch it.

#### Two halves at different versions have to keep working

`contract.py` decides what a difference costs, and it decides it against **what this graph is
sending**, not against everything the pack can do. A pack that knows about `replaces` talking to a
compiler that does not is perfectly good for every brief that replaces nobody, and refusing those
would be breaking working setups to protect a feature they are not using.

    stop      the compiler cannot do what this graph is asking. Refused before any media travels,
              naming the field or the slot and which half to update.
    note      something differs and this graph does not depend on it. One line in the report.
    silence   nothing differs, or nothing either half can see.

A drifted director copy is never a stop: the Director node sends the prose in its box, so what
compiles is always what the canvas showed. A service too old to publish a contract is one note, not
a failure.

#### The scan that saw one refusal out of twelve

`compile.py` raises twelve refusal codes as a `BriefRefused`. The test that was supposed to prove
every refusal reaches the node pack with a sentence attached scanned for `super().__init__("...")`,
which is how exactly one of them is raised. The other eleven -- every refusal about a contradictory
request, including all four about who a picture replaces -- were invisible to it, and reached the
user through a branch that says "the service rejected the request".

They are published now, `h3ir_client.REFUSED_AS_ASKED` gives the class one branch, and
`tests/test_comfyui_node.py` reads its list from the shipped contract instead of from the
compiler's source, which is what carried it across the split.


## ComfyUI frontend mechanics, measured rather than assumed

Four of these cost a rebuild of the node surface to discover. They are recorded so nobody re-derives
them, and each has a test in `tests/test_comfyui_schema.py` that fails if the surface stops respecting
it. Measured against `comfyui_frontend_package 1.48.7` and `comfy_api/latest/_io.py`.

- **`advanced` is not a hide.** The per-node expander exists only under Nodes 2.0 and is gated on the
  setting `Comfy.Node.AlwaysShowAdvancedWidgets`. Under the legacy canvas renderer it does nothing at
  all. Design as if every input is visible; treat the collapse as a bonus.
- **A label and its value share one row of about 38 characters.** So a long display name makes both
  unreadable. This is why every label in the pack is one or two words.
- **A multiline STRING with no placeholder prints its own input id** on the canvas:
  `addMultilineWidget` calls `createMultilineInputElement(default, placeholder || name)`. On a
  multiline widget the placeholder is the only label there is, so it has to be the label and the
  example at once and its first line has to stand alone under truncation. A **single-line** STRING's
  placeholder is not drawn at all on the legacy canvas, so there the display name carries everything.
- **Autogrow socket labels come from `names[ordinal]`, or from `prefix + ordinal` zero-based, and they
  overwrite whatever the template declared.** `autogrowOrdinalToName` returns
  `{name, display_name: s}` and `s` wins. So `TemplatePrefix` gives you `reference_0` on the canvas no
  matter what the template's `display_name` says, and `TemplateNames` is the only way to get one-based
  readable labels. Ids with a space in them (`pictures.picture 1`) round-trip through the API format
  and the workflow save without trouble; verified by running one.
- **The frontend already supports several inputs per grown item** (`inputSpecs` is a list and
  `ensureWidgetForInput` runs when its length is not 1), but the Python side takes a single template
  input and `_expand_schema_for_dynamic` reads only the first. That is the mechanical reason the
  picture notes are one positional block and a clip's role lives on a satellite node, not a preference.
- **An AUDIO is a Mapping, not necessarily a dict.** Load Video (Upload) hands out a `LazyAudioMap`
  that shells out to ffmpeg on first key access. `isinstance(audio, dict)` refuses it.
- **A DOM widget's wrapper follows `widget.width`, and the frontend rewrites that on every value
  change.** The Vue side patches the wrapper's inline style each render from a node layout pass, and
  what that pass computes is the node's *content* width, not the node box. Measured: choosing a
  director set `width` to 238 on a node that was still 480 wide, the panel's wrapper went to 218px,
  and the name field was squeezed to eleven pixels -- `Denis Villeneuve` drawn as `De`. It never
  recovered at any node size, and no `computeSize` on either the widget or the node changes it,
  because neither is what the wrapper reads. `width` unset is the state a widget starts in and the
  one that renders full-bleed, so a board that fills its node holds it there:
  `Object.defineProperty(w, "width", { get: () => null, set: () => {} })`. The media tray never hit
  this because it pins its node to one size; anything resizable has to say it.


## Proving a change is live in a running ComfyUI

**A ComfyUI install holds a COPY of this pack, not this checkout.** `custom_nodes/openh3ir` is a
directory somebody copied there; nothing links it to the tree you are editing unless somebody made a
link, and `dir /AL` (or `ls -l`) is how you find out rather than assuming. So a change you make here
is live in a running ComfyUI only after you have put it there.

The two halves fail differently, and the difference is what makes this a trap rather than an
inconvenience:

- **`web/*.js` is served from that copy on every page load.** So fetching
  `/extensions/openh3ir/tray.js` and diffing it against the tree is a real check of what the browser
  is running -- but a match proves only that the two files are equal right now, which is also what
  you see when somebody synced it an hour ago. It is evidence about the file, never about a link.
- **The `.py` files are imported once, at ComfyUI startup.** A copied-in change does nothing until
  the server restarts. This is the half that goes stale silently: the panel offers a new option
  because the JavaScript is current, the user picks it, and the queue refuses it because the Python
  is five days old.

Measured on 2026-08-20: the served `tray.js` matched this checkout byte for byte while `tray.py` in
the same install was five days behind, and the conclusion drawn from the first fact was that the
whole pack was live.

**The cheap read-out is the pack's own refusal.** Set the tray to whatever the change makes possible
and queue the graph. If the running Python predates the change, the node refuses it with the OLD
table's own sentence, naming the options it still believes in, and the failure lands on the Media
node before a model is loaded, so it costs no GPU and no minutes. A refusal quoting the state you
just left is the running process telling you which file it is holding, which is the same discipline
as reading the artifact back instead of trusting the code that wrote it.

**And there is one that costs no queue at all: ask the server for its own node table.**
`GET /object_info/<NodeId>` is built from the `.py` the process imported at startup, so it is the
schema the canvas is actually drawing. Diff it against `define_schema` in the tree and a stale import
is one read away, before anybody opens a browser.

Measured on 2026-08-21, and it is the same trap from the other end: `nodes.py` in the install
was byte-identical to this checkout -- every file was, `web/` included -- while
`/object_info/OpenH3IRDirector` answered with a twelve-field schema from an earlier session, a
`director` combo with `none` in it plus `moves`, `avoids` and a save/load `library`, none of which
exist in the file either copy holds. Equal files on both sides of a copy and a running process three
hours behind them. The `.pyc` timestamps under `custom_nodes/openh3ir/__pycache__` said the same
thing and are the other cheap tell: older than the `.py` beside them means the import is stale.


## Falsifying a guard

**Falsify every test you write. It is not ceremony. It is what distinguishes a test from a
comment.** Break the code the test covers, on purpose, and watch it go red.

**And a test that has never been seen failing is a test nobody has verified.** This suite shipped one
that was green for its whole life while the field it guarded was dropped in transit, so every check
holding the compiler and the pack together has a defect written for it in
`research/contract_falsification.py`: it plants the defect, proves the defect is live, runs the test
that claims to catch it, and puts the file back. Run it on a clean tree and every case must go red.

The case count is deliberately not written here. It moves every time anybody adds a guard, the run
prints it, and a stale number in this file reads as five cases having gone missing. What the run must
report is `0 green, 0 broken`, and `git status` must be clean afterwards.

**It reports three outcomes, not two, and that distinction is the file's second draft.** RED is a
guard that fired. GREEN is a guard that did not. BROKEN is a case that never ran -- the anchor
moved, the write did not land, the edit made the module unimportable, or the test it names no
longer exists. The first draft printed the same thing for GREEN and BROKEN, and two cases hid in
that: one named a test that had been renamed, and one planted an unbalanced parenthesis. pytest
exits non-zero for a `SyntaxError` and for an unknown node id exactly as it does for a failing
assertion, so both printed RED for months of nothing. **Anything that plants defects has to prove it
planted them before it is allowed an opinion about the guard.**

Two traps it records rather than works around, because anything editing source in a loop will hit
them:

  * **Python validates a cached `.pyc` on (mtime, size) and mtime has one-second resolution.** A
    defect exactly as long as what it replaces, planted within a second of the restore before it,
    runs against the OLD bytecode. Five cases reported a guard that does not fire before
    `__pycache__` was wiped between them.
  * **`python -O` strips `assert`.** The first draft checked its anchors with one, so under `-O` a
    moved anchor became a silent no-op: nothing was edited, the test passed on untouched source,
    and the case printed GREEN. Nothing in that file uses `assert` any more.
