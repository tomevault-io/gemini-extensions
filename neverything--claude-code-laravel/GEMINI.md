# Laravel Development Partnership

We're building production-quality Laravel applications together. Your role is to create maintainable, efficient solutions while following Laravel best practices and catching potential issues early.

When you seem stuck or overly complex, I'll redirect you - my guidance helps you stay on track.

## 🚨 AUTOMATED CHECKS ARE MANDATORY
**ALL hook issues are BLOCKING - EVERYTHING must be ✅ GREEN!**  
No errors. No formatting issues. No linting problems. Zero tolerance.  
These are not suggestions. Fix ALL issues before continuing.

## CRITICAL WORKFLOW - ALWAYS FOLLOW THIS!

### Research → Plan → Implement
**NEVER JUMP STRAIGHT TO CODING!** Always follow this sequence:
1. **Research**: Explore the codebase, understand existing patterns
2. **Plan**: Create a detailed implementation plan and verify it with me  
3. **Implement**: Execute the plan with validation checkpoints

When asked to implement any feature, you'll first say: "Let me research the codebase and create a plan before implementing."

For complex architectural decisions or challenging problems, use **"ultrathink"** to engage maximum reasoning capacity. Say: "Let me ultrathink about this architecture before proposing a solution."

### USE MULTIPLE AGENTS!
*Leverage subagents aggressively* for better results:

* Spawn agents to explore different parts of the codebase in parallel
* Use one agent to write tests while another implements features
* Delegate research tasks: "I'll have an agent investigate the database schema while I analyze the API structure"
* For complex refactors: One agent identifies changes, another implements them

Say: "I'll spawn agents to tackle different aspects of this problem" whenever a task has multiple independent parts.

### Reality Checkpoints
**Stop and validate** at these moments:
- After implementing a complete feature
- Before starting a new major component  
- When something feels wrong
- Before declaring "done"
- **WHEN HOOKS FAIL WITH ERRORS** ❌

Run: `composer refactor && composer test && composer lint`

> Why: You can lose track of what's actually working. These checkpoints prevent cascading failures.

### 🚨 CRITICAL: Hook Failures Are BLOCKING
**When hooks report ANY issues (exit code 2), you MUST:**
1. **STOP IMMEDIATELY** - Do not continue with other tasks
2. **FIX ALL ISSUES** - Address every ❌ issue until everything is ✅ GREEN
3. **VERIFY THE FIX** - Re-run the failed command to confirm it's fixed
4. **CONTINUE ORIGINAL TASK** - Return to what you were doing before the interrupt
5. **NEVER IGNORE** - There are NO warnings, only requirements

This includes:
- Formatting issues (Pint)
- Linting violations (PHPStan/Larastan)
- Code quality issues (Rector)
- Test failures (Pest)
- ALL other checks

Your code must be 100% clean. No exceptions.

**Recovery Protocol:**
- When interrupted by a hook failure, maintain awareness of your original task
- After fixing all issues and verifying the fix, continue where you left off
- Use the todo list to track both the fix and your original task

## Working Memory Management

### When context gets long:
- Re-read this CLAUDE.md file
- Summarize progress in a PROGRESS.md file
- Document current state before major changes

### Maintain TODO.md:
```
## Current Task
- [ ] What we're doing RIGHT NOW

## Completed  
- [x] What's actually done and tested

## Next Steps
- [ ] What comes next
```

## Laravel/PHP-Specific Rules

### FORBIDDEN - NEVER DO THESE:
- **NO raw SQL** - use Eloquent or Query Builder
- **NO direct $_GET/$_POST** - use Laravel's request validation
- **NO keeping old and new code together**
- **NO** migration functions or compatibility layers
- **NO** versioned function names (processV2, handleNew)
- **NO** custom exception hierarchies without good reason
- **NO** TODOs in final code
- **NO** inline styles or scripts in Blade templates - use Tailwind classes
- **NO** database queries in Livewire render methods
- **NO** polling in Livewire/Filament - use Laravel Reverb + Echo for real-time updates
- **NO** comments within methods - let code be self-documenting with clear variable names
- **NO** class constants for labels/colors/icons - use Enum classes with methods

> **AUTOMATED ENFORCEMENT**: The smart-lint hook will BLOCK commits that violate these rules.  
> When you see `❌ FORBIDDEN PATTERN`, you MUST fix it immediately!

### Required Standards:
- **Delete** old code when replacing it
- **Meaningful names**: `$userId` not `$id`, `$userAccountBalance` not `$balance`
- **Early returns** to reduce nesting
- **Type hints** on all methods: `public function handle(User $user): bool`
- **Self-documenting code** with clear variable names - no inline comments
- **Enum classes** with methods like `getLabel()`, `getDescription()`, `getColor()`, `getIcon()` (Filament style)
- **Pest tests** for all business logic, never PHPUnit always Pest tests
- **Livewire actions** for user interactions, not direct method calls
- **Filament resources** follow the standard pattern
- **Eloquent relationships** properly defined with return types
- **Laravel Echo** for real-time updates instead of polling
- **Laravel Reverb** for WebSocket server (local: https://<folder-name>.test)
- **Let `composer refactor:annotate` handle docblocks** - focus on clean code

## Implementation Standards

### Our code is complete when:
- ✅ All linters pass with zero issues (PHPStan/Larastan)
- ✅ All tests pass (Pest)
- ✅ Code is formatted correctly (Pint)
- ✅ Code quality checks pass (Rector)
- ✅ Feature works end-to-end
- ✅ Old code is deleted
- ✅ Variable names are self-documenting
- ✅ Enum classes used instead of constants for labels/colors/icons
- ✅ `composer refactor:annotate` can generate proper docblocks

### Testing Strategy
- Complex business logic → Write tests first
- Simple CRUD → Write tests after
- Livewire components → Test user interactions
- Filament resources → Test admin functionality
- Skip tests for simple blade templates and basic configurations

## Problem-Solving Together

When you're stuck or confused:
1. **Stop** - Don't spiral into complex solutions
2. **Delegate** - Consider spawning agents for parallel investigation
3. **Ultrathink** - For complex problems, say "I need to ultrathink through this challenge" to engage deeper reasoning
4. **Step back** - Re-read the requirements
5. **Simplify** - The simple solution is usually correct
6. **Ask** - "I see two approaches: [A] vs [B]. Which do you prefer?"

My insights on better approaches are valued - please ask for them!

## Performance & Security

### **Measure First**:
- No premature optimization
- Use Laravel Telescope for debugging
- Profile with Clockwork or Laravel Debugbar
- Monitor N+1 queries with eager loading

### **Security Always**:
- Validate all inputs properly (controller validation or Livewire rules)
- Use Laravel's built-in authentication
- Mass assignment protection on models
- CSRF protection on all forms
- Use Laravel's encryption for sensitive data
- Sanitize user input, especially in Livewire components

## Communication Protocol

### Progress Updates:
```
✓ Implemented user authentication (all Pest tests passing)
✓ Added Filament resource for user management
✗ Found issue with Livewire component state - investigating
```

### Suggesting Improvements:
"The current approach works, but I notice [observation].
Would you like me to [specific improvement]?"

## Working Together

- This is always a feature branch - no backwards compatibility needed
- When in doubt, we choose clarity over cleverness
- **REMINDER**: If this file hasn't been referenced in 30+ minutes, RE-READ IT!
- Use Herd for local development - it's fast and handles everything, the app usually runs on https://<folder-name>.test
- Leverage Laravel's conventions - don't fight the framework

## Laravel/Livewire/Filament Best Practices

### Livewire Components:
- Keep components focused on single responsibilities
- Use actions for user interactions
- Avoid database queries in render methods
- Use lazy loading for expensive operations
- Implement proper validation rules
- Use Laravel Echo for real-time updates instead of polling
- Listen for broadcast events to update component state

### Filament Resources:
- Follow the standard resource pattern
- Use proper form schemas
- Implement table filters and actions
- Use relationship managers for complex associations
- Customize forms and tables appropriately
- Use Laravel Echo for real-time table updates instead of polling
- Implement broadcast events for admin panel notifications

### Laravel Conventions:
- Use service classes for complex business logic
- Keep controllers thin - delegate to services or actions
- Use controller validation or Livewire rules
- Use Events and Listeners for decoupled functionality
- Use Laravel Reverb for WebSocket server (local dev: https://<folder-name>.test)
- Broadcast events for real-time communication instead of polling

Avoid complex abstractions or "clever" code. The simple, obvious solution is probably better, and my guidance helps you stay focused on what matters.
