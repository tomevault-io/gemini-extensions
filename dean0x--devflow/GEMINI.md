# Devflow Development Guide

Instructions for developers and AI agents working on Devflow. For user docs, see README.md.

## Purpose

Devflow enhances Claude Code with intelligent development workflows. Modifications must:
- Maintain brutal honesty in review outputs (no sycophancy)
- Preserve context across sessions
- Enhance developer empowerment without replacing judgment
- Ensure all commands are self-documenting

## Architecture Overview

Plugin marketplace with 18 plugins (9 core + 9 optional language/ecosystem), each following the Claude plugins format (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `commands/`, `agents/`, `skills/`).

| `devflow-plan` | Unified design planning with gap analysis | Optional |
| `devflow-code-review` | Comprehensive code review | Optional |
| `devflow-resolve` | Review issue resolution | Optional |
| `devflow-debug` | Competing hypothesis debugging | Optional |
| `devflow-explore` | Codebase exploration with KB creation | Optional |

| `devflow-rust` | Rust language patterns (optional) | No |

Commands with Teams Variant ship as `{name}.md` (parallel subagents) and `{name}-teams.md` (Agent Teams with debate). The installer copies the chosen variant based on `--teams`/`--no-teams` flag.

**Build-time asset distribution**: Skills and agents are stored once in `shared/skills/` and `shared/agents/`, then copied to each plugin at build time based on `plugin.json` manifests. This eliminates duplication in git.

**Working Memory**: Four shell-script hooks (`scripts/hooks/`) provide automatic session continuity. Toggleable via `devflow memory --enable/--disable/--status` or `devflow init --memory/--no-memory`. UserPromptSubmit (`prompt-capture-memory`) captures user prompt to `.memory/.pending-turns.jsonl` queue. Stop hook captures `assistant_message` (on `end_turn` only) to same queue, then spawns throttled background `claude -p --model haiku` updater (skips if triggered <2min ago; concurrent sessions serialize via mkdir-based lock). Background updater uses `mv`-based atomic handoff to process all pending turns in batch (capped at 10 most recent), with crash recovery via `.pending-turns.processing` file. Updates `.memory/WORKING-MEMORY.md` with structured sections (`## Now`, `## Progress`, `## Decisions`, `## Modified Files`, `## Context`, `## Session Log`). SessionStart hook → injects previous memory + git state as `additionalContext` on `/clear`, startup, or compact (warns if >1h stale; injects pre-compact memory snapshot when compaction happened mid-session). PreCompact hook → saves git state + WORKING-MEMORY.md snapshot + bootstraps minimal WORKING-MEMORY.md if none exists. Disabling memory removes all four hooks. Use `devflow memory --clear` to clean up pending queue files across projects. Zero-ceremony context preservation.

**Ambient Mode**: Three-layer architecture for always-on intent classification. SessionStart hook (`session-start-classification`) reads lean classification rules (`~/.claude/skills/devflow:router/classification-rules.md`, ~30 lines) and injects as `additionalContext` — once per session, deterministic, zero model overhead. UserPromptSubmit hook (`preamble`) injects a one-sentence prompt per message triggering classification + conditional router loading via Skill tool. Router SKILL.md is a pure skill lookup table (~50 lines) loaded on-demand only for GUIDED/ORCHESTRATED depth — maps intent×depth to domain and orchestration skills. Toggleable via `devflow ambient --enable/--disable/--status` or `devflow init`.

**Self-Learning**: A SessionEnd hook (`session-end-learning`) accumulates session IDs and triggers a background `claude -p --model sonnet` every 3 sessions (5 at 15+ observations) to detect **4 observation types** — workflow, procedural, decision, and pitfall — from batch transcripts. Transcript content is split into two channels by `scripts/hooks/lib/transcript-filter.cjs`: `USER_SIGNALS` (plain user messages, feeds workflow/procedural detection) and `DIALOG_PAIRS` (prior-assistant + user turns, feeds decision/pitfall detection). Detection uses per-type linguistic markers and quality gates stored in each observation as `quality_ok`. Per-type thresholds govern promotion (workflow: 3 required; procedural: 4 required; decision/pitfall: 2 required), each with independent temporal spread requirements. Observations accumulate in `.memory/learning-log.jsonl`; their lifecycle is `observing → ready → created → deprecated`. When thresholds are met, `json-helper.cjs render-ready` renders deterministically to 4 targets: slash commands (`.claude/commands/self-learning/`), skills (`.claude/skills/{slug}/`), decisions.md ADR entries, and pitfalls.md PF entries. A session-start feedback reconciler (`json-helper.cjs reconcile-manifest`) checks the manifest at `.memory/.learning-manifest.json` against the filesystem to detect deletions (applies 0.3× confidence penalty) and edits (ignored per D13). The reconciler also **self-heals** from render-ready crash-window states: when a decisions file contains an ADR/PF anchor that is absent from the manifest *and* the section carries the `- **Source**: self-learning:` marker, the heal scans the log for `status: 'ready'` observations matching by normalized pattern (exactly one match = upgrade to `status: 'created'` and reconstruct manifest entry; zero or multiple matches = silently skipped). The marker check excludes pre-v2 seeded entries from the heal path so they cannot be falsely paired with a current ready obs. Loaded artifacts are reinforced locally (no LLM) on each session end. Single toggle mechanism: hook presence in `settings.json` IS the enabled state — no `enabled` field in `learning.json`. Toggleable via `devflow learn --enable/--disable/--status` or `devflow init --learn/--no-learn`. Configurable model/throttle/caps/debug via `devflow learn --configure`. Use `devflow learn --reset` to remove all artifacts + log + transient state. Use `devflow learn --purge` to remove invalid observations. Use `devflow learn --review` to inspect observations needing attention. Debug logs stored at `~/.devflow/logs/{project-slug}/`. The `decisions-format` skill is a format specification only; the actual writer is `scripts/hooks/background-learning` via `json-helper.cjs render-ready`.

**Claude Code Flags**: Typed registry (`src/cli/utils/flags.ts`) for managing Claude Code feature flags (env vars and top-level settings). Pure functions `applyFlags`/`stripFlags`/`getDefaultFlags` follow the `applyTeamsConfig`/`stripTeamsConfig` pattern. Initial flags: `tool-search`, `lsp`, `clear-context-on-plan` (default ON), `brief`, `disable-1m-context` (default OFF). Manageable via `devflow flags --enable/--disable/--status/--list`. Stored in manifest `features.flags: string[]`.

**Feature Knowledge Bases**: Per-feature `.features/` directory containing KNOWLEDGE.md files that capture area-specific patterns, conventions, architecture, and gotchas. KBs are created as side-effects of implementation (implement:orch Phase 8), loaded automatically across all workflows via `FEATURE_KNOWLEDGE` variable (companion to `DECISIONS_CONTEXT`), and use staleness detection via git log against `referencedFiles`. Index at `.features/index.json` (object keyed by slug). Managed via `devflow kb list|create|check|refresh|remove`. Knowledge agent (sonnet) structures exploration outputs into KNOWLEDGE.md. `apply-feature-kb` skill provides consumption algorithm for agents. `.features/.kb.lock` is gitignored (transient lock directory for concurrent index writes, added automatically by `devflow init`). `devflow kb list` — List all feature KBs with staleness status. `devflow kb create <slug>` — Create a new KB via claude -p exploration. `devflow kb check` — Check all KBs for staleness. `devflow kb refresh [slug]` — Refresh stale KB(s). `devflow kb remove <slug>` — Remove a KB and its index entry. Note: debug:orch keeps FEATURE_KNOWLEDGE orchestrator-local (investigation workers examine code without pre-loaded context). Toggleable via `devflow kb --enable/--disable/--status` or `devflow init --kb/--no-kb`. SessionEnd hook auto-refreshes stale KBs (throttled to once per 2 hours, max 3 per run). `.features/.disabled` sentinel gates Phase 8 generation and refresh hook.

**Two-Mode Init**: `devflow init` offers Recommended (sensible defaults, quick setup) or Advanced (full interactive flow) after plugin selection. `--recommended` / `--advanced` CLI flags for non-interactive use. Recommended applies: ambient ON, memory ON, learn ON, HUD ON, teams OFF, default-ON flags, .claudeignore ON, auto-install safe-delete if trash CLI detected, user-mode security deny list.

**Migrations**: Run-once migrations execute automatically on `devflow init`, tracked at `~/.devflow/migrations.json` (scope-independent; single file regardless of user-scope vs local-scope installs). Registry: append an entry to `MIGRATIONS` in `src/cli/utils/migrations.ts`. Scopes: `global` (runs once per machine, no project context) vs `per-project` (sweeps all discovered Claude-enabled projects in parallel). Failures are non-fatal — migrations retry on next init. Currently registered per-project migrations include `purge-legacy-knowledge-v2` (removes 4 hardcoded pre-v2 ADR/PF IDs and orphan `PROJECT-PATTERNS.md`) and `purge-legacy-knowledge-v3` (v3: sweeps all remaining pre-v2 seeded entries using the `- **Source**: self-learning:` format discriminator — any ADR/PF section lacking this marker is removed; entries the user edited to include the marker survive). **D37 edge case**: a project cloned *after* migrations have run won't be swept (the marker is global, not per-project). Recovery: `rm ~/.devflow/migrations.json` forces a re-sweep on next `devflow init`.

## Documentation Artifacts

All generated docs live under `.docs/` in the project root:

```
.docs/
├── reviews/{branch-slug}/              # Review reports per branch
│   ├── .last-review-head              # HEAD SHA for incremental reviews
│   └── {timestamp}/                   # Timestamped review directory

└── design/                            # Design artifacts from /plan
```

Working memory files live in a dedicated `.memory/` directory:

```
.memory/
├── WORKING-MEMORY.md         # Auto-maintained by background updater (queue-based, updated in batch)
├── backup.json               # Pre-compact git state snapshot

├── .learning-notified-at     # New artifact notification marker (epoch timestamp)
├── .learning-manifest.json   # Rendered artifact manifest — reconciled at session-start for feedback loop
├── .pending-turns.jsonl      # Queue of captured user/assistant turns (JSONL, ephemeral)
├── .pending-turns.processing  # Atomic handoff during background processing (transient)
└── decisions/
    ├── decisions.md           # Architectural decisions (ADR-NNN, append-only) — written by background-learning extractor via render-ready
    └── pitfalls.md            # Known pitfalls (PF-NNN, area-specific gotchas) — written by background-learning extractor via render-ready

~/.devflow/logs/{project-slug}/
├── .learning-update.log      # Background learning agent log
└── .working-memory-update.log # Background memory updater log
```

**Naming conventions**: Timestamps as `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM`, branch slugs replace `/` with `-`, topic slugs are lowercase-dashes.

**Persisting agents**: Reviewer → `.docs/reviews/{branch-slug}/{timestamp}/{focus}.md`, Synthesizer → `.docs/reviews/{branch-slug}/{timestamp}/review-summary.md` (review mode), Resolver → `.docs/reviews/{branch-slug}/{timestamp}/resolution-summary.md`, Working Memory → `.memory/WORKING-MEMORY.md` (automatic)

**Incremental Reviews**: `/code-review` writes reports into timestamped subdirectories (`YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM`) and tracks HEAD SHA in `.last-review-head` for incremental diffs. Second review only diffs from last reviewed commit. `/resolve` defaults to latest timestamped directory. Both commands auto-discover git worktrees and process all reviewable branches in parallel.

**Coder Handoff Artifact**: Sequential Coder phases write `.docs/handoff.md` after each phase. Survives context compaction (unlike PRIOR_PHASE_SUMMARY). Every Coder reads it on startup. Deleted by implement:orch orchestration skill after pipeline completes.

**Universal Skill Installation**: All skills from all plugins are always installed, regardless of plugin selection. Skills are tiny markdown files installed as `~/.claude/skills/devflow:{name}/` (namespaced to avoid collisions with other plugin ecosystems). Source directories in `shared/skills/` stay unprefixed — the `devflow:` prefix is applied at install-time only. Shadow overrides live at `~/.devflow/skills/{name}/` (unprefixed); when shadowed, the installer copies the user's version to the prefixed install target. Only commands and agents remain plugin-specific.

**Model Strategy**: Explicit model assignments in agent frontmatter override the user's session model. Opus for analysis agents (reviewer, scrutinizer, evaluator, designer), Sonnet for execution agents (coder, simplifier, resolver, skimmer, tester), Haiku for I/O agents (git, synthesizer, validator).

## Agent & Command Roster

**Orchestration commands** (spawn agents, never do agent work in main session):
- `/plan` — Skimmer + Explore + Designer + Synthesizer + Plan + Designer → design artifact; consumes decisions via index + on-demand Read via `devflow:apply-decisions`
- `/implement` — Git + Coder + Validator + Simplifier + Scrutinizer + Evaluator + Tester → PR (accepts plan documents, issues, or task descriptions)
- `/code-review` — 7-11 Reviewer agents + Git + Synthesizer; consumes decisions via index + on-demand Read via `devflow:apply-decisions`
- `/resolve` — N Resolver agents + Git; loads compact decisions index (`decisions-index.cjs index`) per worktree and passes it as `DECISIONS_CONTEXT` to each Resolver; Resolvers use `devflow:apply-decisions` to Read full bodies on demand; aggregates cited ADR-NNN/PF-NNN IDs into a `## Decisions Citations` section at the top of `resolution-summary.md`
- `/explore` — Skimmer + Explore + Synthesizer + Knowledge (optional KB creation)
- `/debug` — Agent Teams competing hypotheses
- `/self-review` — Simplifier then Scrutinizer (sequential); consumes decisions via index + on-demand Read via `devflow:apply-decisions`
- `/audit-claude` — CLAUDE.md audit (optional plugin)

**Shared agents** (13): git, synthesizer, skimmer, simplifier, coder, reviewer, resolver, evaluator, tester, scrutinizer, validator, designer, knowledge

**Plugin-specific agents** (1): claude-md-auditor

**Orchestration skills** (7): implement:orch, explore:orch, debug:orch, plan:orch, review:orch, resolve:orch, pipeline:orch. These enable the same agent pipelines as slash commands but triggered via ambient intent classification.

**Agent Teams**: 6 commands use Agent Teams (`/code-review`, `/implement`, `/plan`, `/explore`, `/debug`, `/resolve`). One-team-per-session constraint — must TeamDelete before creating next team.

## Key Conventions

### Skills

- 3-tier system: Foundation (shared patterns), Specialized (auto-activate), Domain (language/framework)
- Each skill has one non-negotiable **Iron Law** in its `SKILL.md`
- Target: ~120-150 lines per SKILL.md with progressive disclosure to `references/`
- Skills default to read-only (`allowed-tools: Read, Grep, Glob`); exceptions: git/review skills add `Bash`, interactive skills add `AskUserQuestion`, `quality-gates` adds `Write` for state persistence, and `router` omits `allowed-tools` entirely (unrestricted, as the main-session orchestrator)
- All skills live in `shared/skills/` — add to plugin `plugin.json` `skills` array, then `npm run build`
- Orchestration skills (`*:orch`) follow the Phase Protocol (defined in `router/SKILL.md`) — each phase needs `**Produces:**`/`**Requires:**` annotations and a `## Phase Completion Checklist`

### Agents

- Target: 50-150 lines depending on type (Utility 50-80, Worker 80-120)
- Reference skills via frontmatter, don't duplicate skill content
- Use `tools` frontmatter to platform-restrict agent tool access (prefer over prompt-level prohibitions)
- Define clear input/output contracts and escalation boundaries
- Shared agents live in `shared/agents/` — add to plugin `plugin.json` `agents` array

### Commands

- Commands are orchestration-only — spawn agents, never do agent work in main session
- Create in `plugins/devflow-{plugin}/commands/`
- Register new plugins in `DEVFLOW_PLUGINS` in `src/cli/plugins.ts`

### Commits

Use conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:`

## Critical Rules

### Git Safety
- Run git commands sequentially, never in parallel
- Never force push without explicit user request

### Build System
- `shared/skills/` and `shared/agents/` are the single source of truth
- Generated copies in `plugins/*/skills/` and shared agent files are gitignored
- Always run `npm run build` after modifying shared assets
- Plugin manifests (`plugin.json`) declare `skills` and `agents` arrays
- Every `-teams.md` command variant **must** have a matching base `.md` file — the installer iterates base files and looks up teams variants, so orphaned `-teams.md` files are silently skipped

### Token Optimization
- Sub-agents cannot invoke other sub-agents (by design)
- Use parallel execution where possible
- Leverage `.claudeignore` for context reduction
