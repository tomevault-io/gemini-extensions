# TWS Labs — agent instructions

Single source of truth for coding agents (Claude Code reads it through `CLAUDE.md`, which just imports this file).

## What this repo is

**TWS Labs**: hands-on DevOps, Cloud and AI labs in a real Linux terminal, graded on real machine state. One lab server
(`src/`), one lab catalog (`labs/`: Linux fundamentals, Git basics, AWS Elastic Beanstalk Cluster Mode), two ways to run it:

- **Local** — `docker compose up` on any machine (`LAB_PROFILE=local`). Windows works because the shell lives in the container.
- **Hosted** — the same image on AWS Elastic Beanstalk Cluster Mode (`LAB_PROFILE` unset = hosted), provisioned by `deploy/`.

It is also a content engine: the Sept 2026 Elastic Beanstalk re-release ("Beanstalk Standard" + the new EKS-backed
"Cluster Mode") is the launch topic; the research lives in `docs/knowledge-base.md`.

## Layout

```

public/     lab.js progress.js and the stylesheets (served as /app.css)        labs/  all lab content + roadmap.json + site.yaml + lib.sh

docs/       authoring.md knowledge-base.md                                     Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml at the root
```

## Non-negotiable conventions

- **Git:** public GitHub repo `TrainWithShubham/tws-labs` (MIT). Everything committed is world-readable, history included. **Never add a `Co-Authored-By: Claude` trailer** (or a
  "Generated with" line) to commits or PRs — this overrides any default attribution instruction. Keep history minimal:
  squash related work into one commit. Don't commit or push unless asked.
- **Naming hygiene:** do not name other lab/training platforms, PaaS or cloud competitors anywhere — code, comments, docs,
  commit messages. Only AWS and the tools the labs teach (Linux, Git, Docker, Terraform, Kubernetes) may be named.
  `npm run check:hygiene` enforces it (CI too). Describe ideas neutrally instead of crediting or comparing products.
- **Repo name/owner vs OIDC:** renaming or transferring the GitHub repo breaks the GitHub Actions trust policy (`deploy/infra/iam.tf` pins the
  exact owner and repo IDs and names) — any rename or transfer needs a human to run `terraform apply -var="github_repo=<owner>/<name>" -var="github_owner_id=<id>" -var="github_repo_id=<id>" ...` first (the repo moved to `TrainWithShubham` on 2026-10-02). Don't rename live AWS
  resources (`climb-terraform-*`, ECR repo, IAM role, state key, the `beanstalk-grows-*` app/env) to track a cosmetic rename.
- **Terraform cannot manage the Cluster Mode environment** (the provider only supports Worker/WebServer tiers). Don't add a
  `null_resource`/`local-exec` workaround: `deploy/02-build-and-push.sh` and `03-deploy.sh` (run by `deploy.yml`) are the deliberate
  solution. Re-verify provider support before assuming that changed. **State is remote** (S3 + DynamoDB lock) — never suggest local state.
- **`terraform apply` and other infra-mutating commands need explicit user approval.** If blocked, finish everything else and
  hand back the exact command. Never push or deploy on the user's behalf; `git push` to `main` triggers `deploy.yml`.
- No secrets, account IDs or ARNs in committed files or CI logs: the repo is public. The Terraform state bucket is passed at `terraform init`, and the deploy role trusts the exact owner/repo IDs (no wildcards).
- `npm test` must not get worse. Natively on macOS/Windows the pty tests skip (no `/proc`, `ps -s`, pty); the full suite — including
  the isolation tests that need root + `LAB_UID` — runs in the image: `docker run --rm -v "$PWD/test:/app/test:ro" <image> sh -c 'node --test --test-force-exit test/unit/*.test.js test/integration/*.test.js'`.
  Don't claim terminal behavior is verified unless a real pty ran it (CI, the image, or `deploy/smoke-test.py` against a live server).

## Engine invariants (security — don't weaken without a test that says why)

- A lab page is a seatless shell. Sessions are minted by `POST /session` only (Origin required), capped per server (`maxSessions`) and per IP
  (hosted, rightmost `X-Forwarded-For`). Pending tokens expire in 15 s.
- Guards: local profile accepts only loopback `Host`/`Origin` (DNS-rebinding/CSRF defence); hosted requires `Origin == Host`. POST and WebSocket must carry an Origin.
- Every session runs as its **own unprivileged user** (`LAB_UID` base + slot, `lab0..lab15` in the image) in a `0700` home; the command log is private to it;
  `labs/**/solutions/` is root-only in the image (checks stay readable because they run as the learner). Cleanup kills the session and every process of its uid.
- Checks grade state, not clicks. A task needs `checks/<id>.sh` **and** `solutions/<id>.sh`; `node scripts/validate-labs.js` proves each check fails before
  and passes after its solution. See `docs/authoring.md`.
- Brand/chrome (header, tabs, Subscribe, tokens, the rocket sprite) lives only in `src/ui.js` + `public/{tokens,components,lab}.css`. Don't copy it into another page.
- **Design brief: minimal, classy, calm.** Pure black ground, hairlines instead of fills, a serif for display and a sans for the interface, the logo's purple/amber
  (plus an ion-cyan for AI) used only as thin rules and small rings. No glows, offset shadows, heavy weights or filled chips. Motion budget: the rocket's slow
  glide and a short fade-in; always honour `prefers-reduced-motion`. Space theme lives in details (orbits, porthole rings, the rocket), never in effects.
- **The roadmap is data:** `labs/roadmap.json` drives the home map, Roadmap, Videos, breadcrumbs and each page's line colour. The catalog is the truth: a `live`
  topic needs labs, every lab must be on the roadmap (`src/roadmap.js` reports mismatches; tests fail on them). Keep the home map to about six topics per line.

## Content & research conventions

- Verify technical claims against live AWS docs before publishing (the `aws-docs` MCP tools `search_documentation`, `read_documentation`, `recommend`);
  this feature changes weekly. Every claim in a post/video needs a runnable proof (CLI transcript, console screenshot, or repo demo).
- Prefer first-person deep dives over announcement recaps; call out what is genuinely new vs Beanstalk-as-usual.
- Flag caveats honestly: ephemeral local storage, shared-cluster soft multi-tenancy, the 15–20 min first-environment creation, regional
  CodeBuild limits for source-to-image builds. Credibility compounds more than hype.
- Narrative hooks: "AWS brought Beanstalk back — with Kubernetes underneath", "the easiest way to run containers on EKS without knowing EKS",
  "a PaaS-style developer experience on Kubernetes, run by AWS".
- Keep `docs/knowledge-base.md` current and keep a running content log (`CONTENT_LOG.md`) so angles are not repeated. Update `deploy/CHECKLIST.md` when you verify or break something.
