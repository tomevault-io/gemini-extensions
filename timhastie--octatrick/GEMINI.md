# Working in this repository

**Read `PLAN.md` first.** It says what octabam is now — a remixer for the
Octatrack's OS that composes modules, each credited to its author, into
one image built from the user's own 1.40C — where that
stands, what is measured about the ground, and the work order.
`docs/remixer/PLACEMENT.md` is the architecture record for where code goes.

The repo is organised as **modules** (`modules/<name>/manifest.py` declares one
contribution) composed into **remixes** (`remixes/<name>.py` selects a set).
`make modules` lists them, with the compatibility matrix; `make remix`
composes one. `docs/remixer/MODULES.md` is the contributor guide and
`CONTRIBUTING.md` the contract. The build refuses to start when two selected
modules claim the same FX2 id, cave, hook site, detour site, poke, runtime
write, core-private Y word, or the per-core FX2 buffer region — by name.

**Modules come in kinds, and the traps below say which they belong to.** A
**ColdFire module** (linked GNU-as units, detours by symbol, a runtime in
DRAM: midisc, Octakit, octalab, REPITCH) never touches the DSP and none of the DSP traps
apply to it; its own traps are in the last section. On the DSP side an
insert has no bus role, no shared-window claim, sits in both payloads and
runs on any track; a **server** pays for the rotation, the housekeeping
election, the auto-gain and the payload asymmetry, and most of the DSP
traps are a server's.

**A port is a proof.** The author's own build is the oracle: `pinned`,
`reference(addr)`, `Linked.reference` and a `Runtime` recipe's identities
are four forms of one rule, and the build refuses on drift. Never "port" by
rewriting; run their build against the shared stock image first.

**If you change the BUILD rather than a module, prove it changed nothing:**
`scripts/refhash.sh save` on a tree you trust, then `scripts/refhash.sh check`
— 26 configurations, artifacts and build reports, bit-identical. Every step
of the DRAM platform landed under that gate. (Since 10 Sep 2026 the report
prints tool paths; a path change is a report change and needs a re-save
after the artifacts are shown identical.)

**Never an Elektron byte in the repo** — no image, no slice, no `.syx`, in a
commit or on an issue. `.incbin` from the user's stock image at build time
is the pattern.

## Build and check

```bash
make modules                    # the index, the compatibility matrix, the remixes
make check REMIX=<name>         # build + cycles + every gate + boot under the port, no hardware
OT_PROJECT=<dir> [OT_BANK=2] make check REMIX=<name>   # + that project on the image under the port: ids, page-2 delivery, chain audio, main out
make bus REMIX=<name>           # THE build (XBUS=1 SPEC=1) -> out/mainos_bus.bin
make render                     # hear the bus locally, ~6x real time
make reverb IN=loop.wav ARGS='--wet --mode all'
```

Never claim something works because it assembled or linked. `make check` is
the floor.

**ALWAYS WORK IN A GIT WORKTREE, never in the main checkout.** Several
sessions share this repository at once; the main checkout's working tree,
index and stash list are theirs as much as yours. Start every task with
`git worktree add .claude/worktrees/<name> -b <branch> origin/main`, work
and run the gates there, and open the PR from it. Never `git stash` or
`git stash pop` in the main checkout: on 13 Sep 2026 a pop there took
another session's stash (`o14 port edits`) instead of the caller's own
and a `stash drop` removed it from the list -- restored by commit SHA,
but only because the dangling commits were still there. In a worktree:
`vendor/` and `.venv/` are symlinks to the main checkout's (gitignored,
and excluded in `.git/info/exclude`); `out/raw/section_3_MAIN_OS.bin`
must be there too (`make os && make recon`, or copy it); without them the
selftest reports "remix X does not build" and every gate fails before it
starts. `git submodule update --init` in the worktree as well. **Do NOT
symlink `out/emu`**: its CMake cache names the main checkout's sources,
so `cmake --build` there compiles THEIR `tools/emu/ot_emu`, not yours
(14 Sep 2026: a port edit "built" fine and the binary did not have it).
Build the port into the worktree: `make emu-cf` (a fresh cache, ~1 min).
**The same holds for `dsp_host` and `dsp_asm`:** `scripts/setup.sh` builds
them from a COPY staged into `vendor/dsp56300/source/dsp_host/`, so in a
worktree the shared binary is the main checkout's, whatever the branch's
`tools/harness/dsp_host/dsp_host.cpp` says, and `dsp_host` ignores an
option it does not know. PR #356 was reviewed twice (21–22 Sep 2026) as
"MOD has no effect, residual 0.000" for exactly this reason: its
`-paramfile` never ran, every render used default knobs, and the effect
was fine (34 gates pass under its own host). A branch that changes
`dsp_host.cpp` is built in an isolated tree, never into `vendor/`:

```
cat > /tmp/hostpr/CMakeLists.txt <<EOF
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
project(hostpr CXX)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
add_subdirectory(/ABS/PATH/TO/main/vendor/dsp56300 dsp56300)
add_executable(dsp_host_pr /ABS/PATH/TO/worktree/tools/harness/dsp_host/dsp_host.cpp)
target_include_directories(dsp_host_pr PRIVATE /ABS/PATH/TO/main/vendor/dsp56300/source)

EOF
cmake -S /tmp/hostpr -B /tmp/hostpr/build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release && cmake --build /tmp/hostpr/build --target dsp_host_pr -j8
```

then point the harness at it (`benchmark_reverbs.HOST`, `send_probe`'s
host path) for that run.

## Traps that have already cost real work

**The assembler mis-encodes instructions, silently.** `dsp_asm` encodes
`tfr a,b` as `rnd b`, and **any `mpy` operand order it doesn't know as
`mpysu`** — found with `mpy x0,y0`, confirmed 9 Aug 2026 for `mpy x1,y1`
and `mpy x0,x1` too (every shipping site is audited safe because its second
operand is always positive, which is the only reason the engine works; the
sites are counted per module in `build_bus.MPYSU_AUDITED`, and since 23 Sep
2026 every `assemble()` round-trips its bytes through the disassembler and
stops on any other mismatch or on a count that differs from the table). `mpysu` treats the SECOND operand as unsigned, so
a negative multiplier there is silently corrupted. `mpy x0,y1` and
`mpy y0,x0` encode signed. Both assemble clean and do the wrong thing.
**Disassemble what you assemble** when a result surprises you — and always
for a new `mpy` whose second operand can go negative. A related family bit
us in shipping code: `cmp a,b` had encoded as `max a,b`, which updates only
the C bit while `blt` tests N^V. **And until 14 Sep 2026 it emitted only
the TWO-WORD displaced move**: `move x:(r7+$15),a` assembled to
`0a77ce 000015` where the chip (and every Elektron payload, 533 sites in A)
has the one-word `0257de` for displacements −64..63 with a data-ALU
register. `tools/patches/dsp56300.patch` adds the one-word form; every
word or cycle number recorded for a displaced move before that date is 2
where the assembler now emits 1 (the emulator's own cycle table prices the
forms 3 and 2; hardware timing of the one-word form under OUR code is
unmeasured — stock runs it every frame). **THE BINARY IS NOT THE SOURCE:**
the encoder lives in the vendored `assembler.cpp` behind that patch, and
a `dsp_asm` built before it silently emits the two-word form for every
site — five images (8–12, 14 Sep 2026) and every price quoted with them
were ~800 words / ~500 cycles heavier than the tree said, found only when
another session's FREE table did not match. After any change under
`tools/patches/` or `tools/harness/dsp_host/`: `scripts/setup.sh` (or
apply the hunk and `cmake --build vendor/dsp56300/build --target dsp_asm
dsp_host`), then assemble `move x:(r7+$15),a` and expect `0257de`.

**READING `a0` EXPOSES THE FRACTIONAL LEFT SHIFT THAT READING `a1` HIDES.**
`mpy` aligns the Q46 product into Q47, so `a1` is the plain fractional
product — which is why "mpy does not double here" is true, and stays true,
for every module that reads a1 (all of them until 29 Aug 2026). Read the LOW
word instead — the idiom for turning an integer product into a wrapping
ramp — and you see the RAW 48-bit content, shift included, so the effective
integer scale is **2× your multiplier**. Nimbus's grain window is one
`mpy phase,2^(23-k)` plus `abs`; written with the arithmetically obvious
`2^(24-k)` it assembled, rendered, and made a perfectly plausible granular
noise while running the window at DOUBLE RATE, which put the two grains of
each pair in phase instead of interleaving. Found by a DC gate, not by ear
and not by any existing check: two triangle windows a half period apart sum
to exactly 1, so **DC in must come back flat** — it came back with 2×-DC
ripple, and went flat (−122 dB) when the multiplier was halved. If you use
a0 for anything, pin it with a test whose arithmetic you can predict exactly.

**A logical op (`and`/`or`/`not`/`asr`-as-mask) on an accumulator leaves the
extension byte (A2/B2) STALE, and the next `move a,x:` SATURATES to full
scale.** Building a sign mask with `move a,b / asr #$17,b,b / not b` and
storing the result writes `0x7FFFFF`, not the bits you computed — the
store's limiter sees A2 inconsistent with A1's sign and clamps. This cost a
long session on the gated-reverb envelope: a branchless mask-select looked
correct and disassembled correctly but pinned the gate open, because every
masked value saturated on store. **Fix: don't hand-roll sign masks. Use the
conditional-transfer ops** — `tmi x0,a` (floor to 0 if negative), `teq x0,a`,
`tpl`/`tge` — which move a CLEAN register into the accumulator, so no A2
staleness. A plain `move #imm,reg` does NOT disturb the condition codes, so
the `sub`/`tst` that sets the flag survives to the Tcc. (This is also why the
sample loop stays branch-free: Tcc replaces the branch AND avoids the trap.)

**A Tcc pair that shares ONE compare is broken by ANY arithmetic between
them — and nothing at the second site looks wrong.** The branch-free idiom
here is `cmp`/`tst` once, then several `Tcc`s that all read the same
condition codes, relying on the fact that MOVES do not disturb them. That
holds until someone inserts real work in the middle. GRAIN's two scatter
latches (line L, line R) shared one wrap flag; adding a density gate
containing `clr b` and `tst a` between them left line R testing garbage, so
it re-latched a random read position EVERY SAMPLE instead of once per grain.
That is broadband noise, and it was audible as a hiss **on the right channel
only** — found by ear (13 Aug), not by any check, because `make check` and
the bit-identity gate were both green: the code was deterministic and every
mode still assembled. Fix: park the compare's RESULT in a scratch slot and
restore the flag with `tst` before each Tcc that needs it. **When you add
anything to a block, check what the code BELOW it assumed about the
condition codes** — the dependency is invisible at the point you edit, and
`clr`, `and`, `abs`, `tst` and every arithmetic op all set them. Same family
as the A2-staleness trap: legal instructions, correct-looking source, wrong
machine behaviour.

**AN ACCUMULATOR-TO-ACCUMULATOR `move a,b` LIMITS; `tfr a,b` MOVES ALL 56
BITS.** A parallel `tfr x1,a  a,x:(r3)+` written to replace `move a,x:(r3)+ /
move a,b` differed on the bit-identity gate whenever `a` exceeded 24 bits
(23 Sep 2026, Modulation's LINE loop; encodings confirmed by disassembly,
found by bisecting one item). The two are interchangeable only when the
source is known to fit.

**`Tcc` takes a REGISTER source, never an accumulator, and `clr` takes an
accumulator, never a register.** `tpl b,a` and `clr x0` are both
InvalidInstruction — caught at assembly, which is the cheap case, but they
look plausible enough to write repeatedly. Move the value through `x0`.

**`dsp_asm` resolves labels by PREFIX, so no new label may have an existing
label as its prefix.** Adding a loop labelled `warmz2` next to the existing
`warmz` assembled to

```
do #<$40,>$13632     ; 064080 013631      (should have been 001374)
```

— `warmz`'s address `0x1363` with the leftover `2` appended. The loop branched
into hyperspace and `dsp_host` SIGSEGVed with no diagnostic. Same family as the
three above: clean assembly, wrong machine code. Found 9 Aug 2026, after three
wrong guesses (emulator memory limits, buffer alignment, a stale modulo) that
were all *reasoned about* rather than disassembled. **Disassembling first would
have cost one step instead of four** — the rule above is not advice.

**Build-time markers and base literals count when they appear in COMMENTS.**
`build_bus.py` census-checks the number of `$30000` literals in the delay
source and requires exactly one `; DMODE_OVERRIDE` / `; DINT_OVERRIDE`
marker — and the substitution is a blanket text replace over the whole file.
Writing *about* either in a comment trips the guard: both happened while
documenting stage 5/6 (a comment explaining why mode 3's immediate must be
decimal spelled the hex out; another explaining the override marker spelled
the marker out). The build refuses, loudly, which is the guard working —
describe them in prose instead of spelling them. The same goes for
`; ROTLATCH` and `; ROTINIT`: the build substitutes a body at the FIRST
occurrence, and on 21 Sep 2026 a housekeeping comment that said "the
ROTLATCH check" took the tracker body while the real marker stayed a
comment -- no client on either payload resolved its write offset, and
`verify-bus` read it as every server's client count changing.
`_marker_once` refuses a second occurrence now.

**AN INSTRUCTION FORM THE CHIP HAS NEVER RUN IS NOT PROVEN BY THE PORT.**
The assembler encodes it, the vendored emulator decodes it the same way, and
the chip may not: image 44 (21 Sep 2026) wedged on its first block on four
one-word displaced Y stores (`move a,y:(r3+$1)`), a form with no site in
either stock payload; the X form has 533. Before using a form, grep it in
`out/dsp/payload_*.asm` (`tools/build/dsp_disasm_all.py`); no precedent means
a hardware probe first, or the form everything else uses.

**`SPEC=1` requires `XBUS=1`.** Without it the accumulators stay in core-private
memory and each half of the tracks can reach only its own core's server — worse
than today, **and it still makes sound.** The build guards this. Do not ungate it.

**The track↔core mapping is INVERTED from old assumptions**: payload A serves
**tracks 5-8** (BusVerb), payload B serves **tracks 1-4** (BusDelay).
Measured 10 Aug 2026 via the MrkVerb32 marker flash, after the assumption cost
two flashes and a session chasing "R13 is dead" (it was alive on tracks 5-8).
Kept deliberately: delay on low tracks, reverb downstream. Test the reverb on
**track 5**, not track 1.

**SEND's `DEL` and `REV` are separate knobs**: `x:(r6+0)` and `x:(r6+1)`
(again since 25 Sep 2026; one knob from 6 Sep). Driving the wrong one
renders silence, which reads as a broken algorithm.

**A DESCRIPTOR'S DISPLAY FORMATTER OVERRIDES ITS VALUE COUNT, and a cloned
descriptor inherits the DONOR's.** A slot can carry a correct count, default,
name and enable bit and still draw as something else entirely — or as nothing
at all. Found on the 17 Aug flash: BusDelay clones SPRING REV, the formatter
fix-up in `build_bus.py` was gated to the reverb, and three of six page-2
slots drew wrong. WOW inherited SPRING TYPE's word-label renderer whose table
has THREE entries, was asked to draw 0..127, and **drew no knob at all**;
MODE inherited SPRING BAL's bipolar pair and drew as a balance dial reading
−64…−60 instead of a 5-way select. Every existing check passed, because every
field they checked was right. `verify_menu` now checks the renderer against
the count (`count < 128` → the enumerated pair with `0x12a` zero; `128` → both
formatters zero). **The general form: when you clone a descriptor, every field
you did not explicitly write is the donor's, and some of them outrank the ones
you did.** Same family as "a slot can draw a knob and publish nothing" — the
panel and the DSP are separate mechanisms and neither validates the other.

**STOCK UNICORN HALVES EVERY ColdFire FRACTIONAL-MODE MULTIPLY AND ADDS
WHERE `msac` SUBTRACTS, and the firmware runs its EMAC in fractional mode
(`MACSR = 0x20`).** Unicorn 2.1.4 computes `macl`/`macw` under `F/I = 1` as
an UNSIGNED product `>> 32` where the MCF5445x does a SIGNED product `>> 31`
(the 2.62 product shifted left one bit, upper 40 bits accumulated), and it
reads the MAC/MSAC bit from the opcode word where ColdFire keeps it in the
extension word, so every `msac` accumulated with the wrong sign (the
sequencer's frame builder is one). One defect, three symptoms that were each
investigated as firmware behaviour for a day (7 Sep 2026, RTOS_FORK
§10.16): the recorder length converter wrote 10,336 for Bryan's 20,672
(explained away as "2-sample units"), the recorder's block walk stalled at
3,072 samples ("needs a DSP position feed"), and the sequencer's per-frame
timing byte advanced 8 per 16-sample frame, which dropped half the tempos'
recorder trigs ("nothing re-locks the step clock", plus a compensation
lever). The firmware's own reciprocal tables (`0x80003c20`: 2^31 / block
size) said which side was wrong. `emu_bringup.emac_selftest` pins the
semantics; `scripts/build_unicorn.sh` builds the fixed
library (`tools/patches/unicorn_emac_fractional.patch`). The general rule is the
same as "disassemble what you assemble": when firmware arithmetic comes out
exactly 2× or ½ off, suspect the INSTRUMENT before inventing a unit, and
find a site in the firmware whose constants only make sense one way.

**STOCK UNICORN'S MAC-WITH-LOAD DECODE HAS THREE DEFECTS, WHICH IS WHY
TIER-0 SHIMS IT PER SITE RATHER THAN THE FORM BEING ABSENT.** Found 22 Sep
2026 by reading markandrus/octemu's independent fix against QEMU 11.1 and
confirming the identical lines are present, verbatim, in Unicorn 2.1.4's
own vendored QEMU 5.0.1 `target/m68k/translate.c`. In `DISAS_INSN(mac)`:
(1) `rx = (ext & 0x8000) ? AREG(ext, 12) : DREG(insn, 12)` reads Rx from
the OPCODE word instead of the extension word; (2)
`dual = ((insn & 0x30) != 0 && (ext & 3) != 0)` reads Ry's own register
field (ext bits 3-0, ANY MAC-with-load) as a dual-accumulate flag, and
`cfv4e` has no `M68K_FEATURE_CF_EMAC_B`, so this `disas_undef`s an ordinary
multiply into an illegal-instruction trap whenever Ry's low bits are set;
(3) the EMAC address MASK register resets to zero instead of CFPRM's
all-ones, and MAC-with-load ANDs its effective address with it, so every
load reads address 0 regardless of the real operand. **Fixing (3) in
`cpu.c`'s `m68k_cpu_reset` does nothing under Unicorn**: `src/uc.c` never
calls `cc->reset()`, only `uc->reg_reset()` (`unicorn.c`), a separate,
minimal function that clears `aregs`/`dregs`/`pc` and nothing else — found
by a `UC_ERR_READ_UNMAPPED` on a `macl ...,%a0@,...` whose `a0` was a
valid mapped address (the AND with a zeroed mask folded it to 0 first).
The fix belongs in `unicorn.c`'s `reg_reset`, not `cpu.c` (kept there too,
for documentation, since a future Unicorn version might wire up the real
reset path). All three are in `tools/patches/unicorn_emac_fractional.patch`;
`emu_bringup.emac_selftest` gained cases for them (fails on stock, passes
fixed). The MAIN OS has zero true dual-accumulate instructions
(`maaac`/`masac`/`msaac`/`mssac`), so forcing `dual = 0` is unconditionally
safe for it. The per-site shim (`emu_bringup._emac_load_shim`) stays:
the only differential against native decode ran route A with no project
on the card, which executes none of the 435 hooked sites (0 shim calls
either way), and route A was retired on 26 Sep 2026.

**MACSR S/U IS BIT 6, AND IN FRACTIONAL MODE IT IS NOT SIGNED/UNSIGNED:
it selects 16-BIT ROUNDING ON THE ACCUMULATOR READ-OUT.** The ColdFire port
had S/U as bit 4 (that is R/T) and returned every `movclrl` as `ACC[39:8]`;
the firmware's level chain at `0x4000ccae` runs at MACSR `0x60` and keeps the
LOW words of two reads as a voice record's mode:level, which the CFPRM's
pseudocode (`OMC,S/U == 01`: `ACC[39:24]` rounded into `Rx[15:0]`, upper half
zero) puts there and a plain `>> 8` leaves at zero — every voice rendered
silent for a whole session (8 Sep 2026, O9b). The self-test never exercised
S/U. Read the CFPRM's MOVCLR pseudocode before touching `accRead`. The ACCext
registers have two layouts as well (fractional: eight extension + eight
low bits per accumulator; integer: sixteen extension bits), and the frame
ISR saves and restores them in INTEGER mode every frame (`0x4000ac96`,
`0x4000d968`); the port's write knew only the fractional layout until 23
Sep 2026 and put the saved word's low byte into ACCn[7:0] on every restore
-- invisible to a stock A/A (deterministic), found by Jannik Aßfalg's A/B/A
of a ColdFire patch. `test_emac.cpp` holds both layouts now.

**THE VENDORED DSP AGU LEFT A MODULO BUFFER ON A PRE-DECREMENT FROM ITS
BASE.** `x:-(r2)` with r2 = 0 and m2 = 0x3f gave `0xffffbf` where the chip
gives `0x3f`, the next sixteen sample writes walked the peripheral registers,
a timer interrupt came alive whose vector in payload B is `move x0,y:(r4)+`,
and the corruption surfaced as a 196,608-iteration voice loop thirteen frames
after the first trig. Found with a one-word write watch, a DSP PC watch with
registers and an interrupt-vector histogram (O9b); fixed in `agu.h`. It is
the eleventh vendored-emulator defect and `dsp_host` renders every effect on
that AGU — `make check`'s bit-identity gates are the audit.

**A REWRITTEN TRAMPOLINE IS NOT RETRANSLATED.** The ColdFire emulator's
EMAC-with-load shim ran every shimmed instruction from one scratch address,
rewriting its bytes each time; in a long-running Unicorn the address kept
its first translation, so the trampoline executed whichever instruction had
been translated there LAST — `msacl ..,%acc1` ran as the previous `msacl
..,%acc0` and corrupted the sequencer's timing byte (RTOS_FORK §10.16.2,
7 Sep 2026). Fresh-Uc micro-tests could not show it; a per-instruction
trace of the real run did. Rule: never rewrite emulated code in place — give
each distinct instruction its own slot (`r.emac_slots`), and when a
micro-test disagrees with the running emulator, the difference is state,
so trace the running emulator.

**A MEASUREMENT CAN BE STRUCTURALLY BLIND TO THE THING YOU ARE USING IT TO
RULE OUT — and it will report "clean" with total confidence.** Two instances,
both on 17 Aug 2026, both costing hours:
- `send_probe`'s THD metric sums harmonics **2f..9f of a 438 Hz tone**. A
  block-rate discontinuity (~2940 Hz) is not a harmonic of 438 Hz, so the
  metric cannot see it. It reported −45 dB ("clean") on audio that hardware
  measurement later showed carrying +22 to +31 dB of inharmonic hash. Every
  "no change" conclusion drawn from it that day was worthless.
- XBUS step 3 concluded "synchronisation not needed" from a cross-core send
  measured **through the reverb** — the one consumer that smears per-sample
  damage into a multi-second tail. It shipped a cross-core race for months.
**Before trusting a null result, ask what the instrument physically cannot
see.** A reverb cannot show you a discontinuity. A harmonic metric cannot show
you an inharmonic one. A lock-step emulator cannot show you a race between
two cores — `dsp_host` boots both payloads since 7 Sep 2026 and `-skew` can
interleave them, but that is a fuzz of the hardware's timing, not the
timing, so a local "clean" is still NOT evidence a bus timing defect is
gone (a local red IS a defect). When local says clean and hardware says
broken, believe the hardware and go looking for what the harness omits.

**A BUS CLIENT THAT REGISTERS BUT CONTRIBUTES NOTHING STEALS EVERYONE ELSE'S
LEVEL.** The auto-gain divides the accumulator by the number of registered
clients, so a writer that registers unconditionally and then writes zero
dilutes the real senders by N/(N+1) — **−6 dB with a single sender.** Two
instances found the same day, 17 Aug: BusVerb registered for its `→DEL` send
even when `→DEL` was off (since gated on the knob, measured −6.02 → +0.00 dB;
the send itself was later retired), and BusDelay's own `IN` knob would have
done it too if its default
had stayed non-zero on a return track with no audio to send. **Gate the
registration on the knob, and remember the level knob is usually decoded
LATER in the block than the registration runs** — read it from `r6` directly,
or use the previous block's value and accept one block of latency. Symptom to
watch for: a level that is flat across sender count in one layout and drifts
in another. It surfaced as an "unexplained residual" in a completely
different effect's send level, and the effect being blamed was innocent.

**r7 scratch `$00..$83` is the per-instance block; `$84+` hangs the unit**
(a host track's own state lives there between calls, images 39–42). Each
module's header maps its own block; a slot census of the source is the
truth, not the map (23 Sep 2026: BusVerb's map said full and 14 slots had
no reference; BusDelay's map listed nine slots the code never touches, and
one it used twice — the PITCH decode's park on grain 3's scatter record).
New per-track state goes in a free slot of the module's own block or the
Y state table. (Do not scan for these with `"\$$s"` in a shell — it expands.)

**A dump can resolve a perfectly plausible dispatch entry for an effect it
does not contain.** `SPEC=1` (which `make render` sets) aliases the absent
server's id to the SEND client — deliberately, so a wrong chooser pick
becomes a send. Locally that alias renders a dry passthrough: silence over
the bus, dry in a `--direct` control, no error anywhere. This produced the
12 Aug "BusDelay outputs nothing in any config" session — the delay was
never instantiated; every measurement ran a SEND. Delay work needs the
hatch (`make render-delay`), and `send_probe.py` now dies when a D layout's
DELAY entry equals SEND's. The general rule: before believing a *negative*
result, check which code the dispatch entry actually points at — same
family as "disassemble what you assemble".

**IN THE SHIPPING REMIX, payload A's half of the shared window is FULLY
OWNED** (a remix without the reverb frees it, which is how the insert
collection has room to stack): BusVerb's
relocated buffers at `0x30000`/`0x34000`, bus scratch at `0x36000-0x36157`
(grew 12 Aug for the DELAY send counts + reciprocal table, 17 Aug when the
accumulators went to FOUR buffers for the cross-core race fix, and 22 Sep
2026 to EIGHT buffers plus the chain at `0x360d8..`).
There is no free ground in it for delay lines — the DEV build places the
delay at its shipping base `0x38000` (payload B's half) for exactly this
reason. A delay based at `0x30000` sweeps the rotation word, all four ACC
buffers and both role locks every 16,384 samples and blows up any
multi-server layout (found 12 Aug, RDS full-scale garbage).

**AN FX2 ID IS ALSO AN FX1 ID: the DSP dispatch tables are indexed by the
raw id and shared by both menus.** A module on a stock effect's id replaces
that effect's code wherever it is selected, FX1 included, and a remix that
omits the module then aliases the id to SEND and takes the stock effect
away from FX1 too. Rungs sat on EQUALIZER's `0x0c` and Nimbus on DJ EQ's
`0x0d` from 29 Aug to 2 Sep 2026, in every local image, unflashed. The
schema now refuses `STOCK_FX2_IDS`; the stock effects themselves are kept
in a chooser by listing them in the remix (`tools/remix/stock.py`). The
same table makes FX1's NONE (id 0) run the FALLBACK's code: SEND ran on
every empty FX1 slot at r7 0x6100/0x6400/0x6700/0x6a00, sent from an
unseen page byte and, on core 1, compared the rotation tracker before
position 0's advance — one step ahead for good on the unit (images 40–47,
21 Sep 2026; `docs/effects/XBUS.md`). A client keys its slot on r7, never
on X:$213 (stale at proc time), and `dsp_host` places FX2 slots at
0x6200 + 0x300·pos (`verify_twocore` had 0x200·pos until image 48).

**`dsp_host`'S DEFAULT AUDIO BLOCK (X:0x80) SITS INSIDE THE SCRATCH THE
STOCK EFFECTS USE.** On hardware the dispatcher passes `r0 = 0`: the audio
block is at X:0 and stock code scratches X:0x20–0xff every block. Our
modules never touch low X, so the default was harmless for months and then
made the stock FLANGER render as Nyquist-rate hash and five other stock
effects 5–17 dB dirtier while passing as "credible" (2 Sep 2026). Eight
instruction probes were spent clearing the emulator first. `send_probe`
passes `-audio 0` for a stock render; if a stock effect sounds wrong
locally, suspect the harness before the effect.

**AN ABSOLUTE STOCK-TABLE ADDRESS IS RIGHT IN PAYLOAD A AND 13 WORDS OFF IN
B, AND THE AUDITION RENDER CANNOT SHOW IT.** The payloads are linked
separately: the 6,305-word curve bank is `X:0x438` in A and `X:0x42b` in B
(the block below it is 23 words on A and 10 on B), and the Y tables shift by
16. Stock code carries a different extension word per payload; a module is
one source assembled into both, so a bare literal into a stock table is
correct on tracks 5–8 and mistuned on 1–4, and past the end of the relocated
table it reads garbage. Bryan T's LOFI2 shipped that way through a week of
renders and several flashes (13 Sep 2026, `docs/firmware/TABLES.md`
"Payload-relative addresses";
measured here from our own image). `send_probe`'s single-payload render dumps
payload A. Declare stock table addresses so the build rewrites them per
payload, or read through a build-supplied base; and audit any stock-table
read on BOTH payloads under `rig_render.py`. Our own modules were scanned
14 Sep 2026 and read none.

**A DESCRIPTOR NAME THAT EXACTLY FILLS ITS FIELD LEAVES NO NUL, AND THE
CRASH LANDS SOMEWHERE ELSE ENTIRELY.** `abbr` is a 5-byte field holding FOUR
characters plus a terminator; `fullname` is 13 bytes holding TWELVE (and the
build tag is appended after your string). A 5-character abbr assembled,
built, drew correctly on the panel and behaved normally under manual knob
use — and threw a line-F exception (VEC:0B) the moment a parameter was
**LFO-MODULATED**, faulting PC `0x48454C4C` = `"HELL"`. It presented as
"custom effects can't be modulated", which points at the clone mechanism,
not at a string. Found 2 Sep 2026 by Bryan T contributing `modules/hello/`,
after the build accepted it silently. A faulting PC made of the field's own
ASCII is a smashed return address, so the copy destination is fixed-size —
INFERRED, the copy is not located; the rule itself is measured (all 30 stock
page descriptors are ≤4 chars with byte 5 zero). `schema.MenuEntry` now
refuses both over-lengths and `build_bus.py` re-checks the string it writes,
tag included — which caught two diagnostic delay names (`BusDlyRPLY`,
`BusDlyNOCF`) that had been filling all 13 bytes since 24 Aug 2026.

**A PART SAVED UNDER AN OLDER SLOT LAYOUT FEEDS THE NEW LAYOUT ITS OLD
BYTES, AND THE SEQUENCER STALLS ON THE FIRST PLAY.** Moving MODE from slot 7
to slot 6 (4 Sep 2026) passed every local check and both hardware claims —
then pressing play went 1, 2, 1 and froze, because every other track's part
still held a 0–127 SHMR/MDEP byte in what was now a count-3 select, the
"value outside its count is used as an index" trap in stored form. The
schema cannot see stored data. Re-selecting the effect on the track you are
looking at is NOT enough; the sequencer runs every track of the part. After
any change to a slot's count, position or meaning: `tools/hw/ot_project.py
stamp-defaults <project> <remix>` on the card BEFORE play, and say so in the
flash notes. (Cause inferred from the symptom and a refreshed project
running clean; not measured.)

**THE PART THE EMULATED LOAD APPLIES IS NOT THE PART THAT PLAYS.** `ot_emu`'s
load applies bank 1 part 1; its transport start re-applies the SAVED bank's
pattern part and the refresher at `0x4000c19c` rewrites the live lane from
it. A fixture that edited "part 1 and its saved copy" measured a track whose
FX2 was still SEND — for a whole O9c session (8 Sep 2026): "the THRU monitor
is pre-FX2", "the page-2 select never crosses" and "X:0x2c0 is the FX2
instance" were all this one fixture, and the last was `stamp-slot` landing in
the track's FX1 (it stamps both slots). Write fixtures into EVERY part of
EVERY bank (`ot_project.py set-fx`, `stamp-slot`), and before believing a
DSP-side "byte-identical" between two cards, run both with `--block-dump`
and `tools/harness/blockdump.py diff`: if no host-port block differs, the
cards did not differ where it matters.

**THE HARNESS'S MODEL OF THE DISPATCHER IS NOT THE DISPATCHER.** `dsp_host`
handed every effect r7 = 0x6100 + 0x100·(2·pos + fx−1); the stock
dispatcher bumps r7 THREE times per track (the third unconditional, after
FX2), so from position 1 on every r7 the harness used was wrong, and two
modules that pinned a track by its r7 (the one-aux return on T8, the
track-8 send refusal) matched in the harness and never on the unit — flash
6's "the return never reaches T8", with `make verify-onebus` green on
exactly that property. Found 8 Sep 2026 by running the shipping image from
the card under the ColdFire port (`docs/history/COLDFIRE_PORT.md` O11). Any module
logic keyed on a dispatcher fact (r7, r6, X:0x213, instance blocks) is
measured under the port (`ot_emu --dsp-pcwatch`), never modelled in
`dsp_host`; and a hardware failure the lock-step harness cannot show goes to
the port before it goes to a guess.

**AN EFFECT'S `init` MUST PRESERVE r1: THE FX1 DISPATCHER KEEPS THE EFFECT
ID THERE ACROSS THE INIT CALL.** `P:0x4c8..0x4d7`: `move b,r1`, `jsr
INIT_TABLE[r1]`, then `move x:(r1+$235),r2 / jsr (r2)` for proc — so an init
that returns with r1 moved sends the proc call through a garbage word to
P:0 = the reset vector, and the core dies AT PROJECT LOAD, before a frame.
Image 99 (13 Sep 2026) did this on every core that loaded a Spectrum on FX1:
its new init zeroed 24 state slots with `move a,x:(r1)+`. It looked like the
step-1 DSP hang and was found under the ColdFire port's last-PC ring in an
hour; `dsp_host` cannot see it because it calls init and proc itself and
never reads r1 between them. Proc may use r1 (the dispatcher reloads it
after proc). `tools/verify/verify_initregs.py` refuses an init that writes
r1/n1/m1 and runs in `make check`. Zero through r5.

**A parameter slot can draw a knob and publish nothing.** The page descriptor
and the DSP-side read are separate mechanisms; `dsp_host` pokes r6 directly, so
everything looks live locally even when the real unit would publish nothing.
See `docs/firmware/PARAM_PAGES.md`.

**Flash cycles are expensive** — each one is a manual firmware write. Render
locally and measure instead of guessing. This is why the emulator path exists.

**When the unit misbehaves, check `docs/remixer/FAILURE_MODES.md` first** — the
register of hardware failure modes (symptom -> cause -> fix). Add any new one
the moment it is seen; do not let it live only in a commit message.

**A PERSISTENT SLOT THAT INIT DOES NOT CLEAR HOLDS WHATEVER THE EFFECT
BEFORE OURS LEFT IN THE BLOCK — AND NO LOCAL RENDER CAN SEE IT, BECAUSE THE
PORT AND `dsp_host` BOOT ZEROED RAM.** Spectrum's init cleared `$00..$17`;
filter B's two HP poles at `$38/$39` (`$3c/$3d` R) sat at cHP = 0 on the
passthrough stamp, FROZEN, and `hp2 = yB − h2` subtracted a stale h2 from
every sample forever: up to a full-scale DC on a station's output. An
AC-coupled capture cannot see DC, so it surfaced as something else entirely
— "the master compressor collapses the RIGHT channel above COMP 40" (the
makeup clipped DC + audio to a constant on the channel whose offset was
larger) — and cost 13–14 Sep 2026: three diagnostic images and 40 hardware
taps rewriting a compressor block that was correct. Found by a LEVEL bisect
across the tracks (post-FX mute cleared it, pre-FX mute did not: the station
made it from state), then reproduced in one run once the instance block was
pre-filled with garbage. Rules: (1) init zeroes EVERY slot the sample loop
reads before it writes — `tools/verify/verify_dirtystate.py` (in `make
verify`) renders each module from a garbage block on silence and refuses any
output; (2) a channel-asymmetric failure in channel-symmetric code is a DATA
asymmetry — go looking for what the instrument cannot see (DC, ultrasonics)
before rewriting the code; a limiter ladder (×2/×4/×8 with the limiting
store) makes DC visible through an AC-coupled capture; (3) when "which knob"
does not localise a fault, "which TRACK" (LEVEL 0 per track, then AMP VOL vs
MUTE) does.

## Traps on the ColdFire / DRAM side (the platform work, 9–10 Sep 2026)

**A WRITE-WATCH ON CACHED ADDRESSES IS BLIND TO A CLEAR THROUGH THE UNCACHED
ALIAS.** The port mapped `0x4F...` as separate memory, so a watch on
`0x477...` reported "8.8 MB free at 0x47700000" — the region is the stock
delay's eight rings, cleared via the alias ~38 M instructions after the boot
detour returns (Bryan's write-up had the ring base as `0x4F502C10` all
along). Retracted; `machine.h` now folds the alias. The general rule is the
instrument-blindness one: before trusting a null result, ask what the
instrument physically cannot see, and check whether a second reading
(here, Bryan T's delay write-up, `docs/firmware/COLDFIRE_DELAY.md`) already
contradicts it.

**THE BOOT VERIFIER BOOTED THE WRONG IMAGE.** `make verify` runs after the
selftest, which builds every remix in turn and leaves the LAST one at
`out/mainos_bus.bin`; the first in-pipeline run booted `warped` looking for
midi-scenes' loader and reported "loader ran 0x". `verify_dram_boot` now
rebuilds its remix first. Any verifier that reads `out/` must know who wrote
it last.

**`make … | grep | tail` reports tail's exit code, not make's.** Capture
with `> log; echo $?`.

**Matching an author's bytes with GNU as:** a same-unit label makes `lea`
assemble PC-relative (write `lea SYM:l`); small `move.l #imm` becomes
`moveq`; a `-Ttext` that is 2 mod 4 gets a leading `nop`. All correct code,
all oracle failures.

**A loader draft clobbered d0 across its copy loop and reused a0 after the
hash.** Register discipline in a boot stub is not checkable by anything but
the port: `verify_dram_boot` watches the loader's entry and its `fatal` hang.

**TWO BUILDS ON ONE MACHINE CORRUPTED EACH OTHER THROUGH FIXED `/tmp`
NAMES (10 Sep 2026).** `build_bus.assemble()` wrote `/tmp/build_bus_src.asm`,
`.bin` and `.sym` by fixed name, so two sessions' `make check` — or the
selftest's per-remix builds beside anyone else's build — read each other's
assembler output: "STREAMZ overruns the region (2883 > 2724 words)",
"selprobe dsp_asm exit 1", a different remix each time, on a clean checkout
too. Found by a peer session. Scratch is `tempfile.mkdtemp` per process now
(`verify_hello` likewise). A failure that moves between remixes across runs
is a shared-scratch race before it is anything else; and a `make check`
result taken while another build was running is not a result.

**The report is API, and it prints paths.** Moving a tool changed the build
report (the hints name `tools/harness/send_probe.py`), which refhash
correctly flagged with every artifact identical. Re-save only after proving
the artifact lines match.

## How claims are written here

The project has been burned by stale confident numbers more than once — a
cycle budget of 1080 that was never a ceiling, a burn probe that measured an
engine we do not ship, a blocker our own bisect had already falsified.

So: **separate measured from inferred.** `docs/firmware/CHIP.md` marks every number with
a confidence marker and keeps retracted values beside current ones. Do the
same. Say what would falsify a claim. Do not write "found it" for something
you have inferred, and when a retraction lands, propagate it to every document
that repeated the old number — not just the one you were editing.

## History

The tree was pruned hard in the octabam refactor: ~350 files of ColdFire
archaeology, emulator scratch and 89 `reverbN.asm` voicing snapshots were
removed. They are all still reachable — that is why the history was carried
across rather than starting fresh.

Comments still cite probes like `dsp/baseprobe.asm` or `dsp/ymemprobe.asm` as
the provenance of a measurement. Those statements remain true; the files live
in history. Recover one with:

```bash
git log --all --oneline -- dsp/baseprobe.asm
git show <sha>:dsp/baseprobe.asm
```

Leave those citations alone. Rewriting them to remove a filename would erase
how the number was obtained, which is the opposite of the point.

On 10 Sep 2026 the tree was regrouped for the remixer: `tools/` into
`build/ verify/ harness/ emu/ hw/ patches/` (plus `remix/` and `scratch/`),
`docs/` into `remixer/ firmware/ effects/ history/`. `git log --follow` crosses
the moves; older commit messages and memory notes name the flat paths.

On 16 Sep 2026 `docs/history/` (18 closed records: BUS, RTOS_FORK,
COLDFIRE_PORT, VOICING, NOTES, REVERB_LOG, XBUS_LOG, EXTERNAL_INGEST, ...)
was removed. A citation of the form `docs/history/RTOS_FORK.md §10.16` in a
comment or a doc is still the provenance of what it sits beside; read it
with `git show 3ceba41:docs/history/RTOS_FORK.md`.

On 22 Sep 2026 `vendor/dsp56300`'s pin moved from `c051afad` (28 Jul) to
`8ccdd843` (21 Sep, 144 commits later), prompted by reading
`markandrus/octemu`'s independent RE and finding upstream had absorbed
several of our own fixes in that span. `tools/patches/dsp56300.patch`
dropped the hunks upstream now carries itself (MPYRI/MACRI, the DCOL
12-bit width, "serve a DMA request raised before the channel was
enabled", 2D/no-update DMA address modes, the assembler's
TFR/CMP/CMPM/Tcc JJJ=000 encoding, JIT MPYI sign-extension, CCR overflow
flags) and kept what is still ours (the AGU pre-decrement fix, the
one-word displaced move, the DMA dual-counter reload, the host-stepped
mode, the shared window, the unmapped-register hooks). Gated on: upstream's
own `dsp56kTestRunner` suite, `scripts/refhash.sh check` against a
pre-repin baseline (24 cases), `verify-bus`, `verify-spectrum-ident`,
`verify-twocore`, and `make check` with a real project under the port
(`verify_set`) -- all bit-identical or passing. Our own AGU fix is still
an open, uncommented upstream PR (#13, since 8 Sep).

Also 22 Sep 2026: measured whether a same-value `DCR` rewrite ever lands
while a self-clearing DMA window is still open (octemu's independent
QEMU fix names this a re-arm, not a no-op, that the vendored emulator was
silently dropping). Instrumented `DmaChannel::setDCR` in an isolated
clone, ran a real project 1200 frames under the port: DCR2 (the ESAI
feed, `0xcc6220`, rewritten every idle-loop pass at `P:0x099`) landed
with the window open on 1199 of 1200 rewrites. Ported octemu's renewal
(`m_deRenewed`, in `setDCR`/`finishTransfer`) — but its block-dump
against the same project, same frame count, is **bit-identical** with or
without the fix, so it is landed defensively (matches the DMA manual's
own semantics, costs nothing, `verify-twocore` and every gate stay
green) rather than as a fix for an observed symptom. Not octemu's other
DE-renewal hunk (disabling `HostTransmitData` as a request source):
`ot_emu` drives HDI08 directly, never through a `DmaChannel`, so that
half doesn't apply here (checked, not inferred).
