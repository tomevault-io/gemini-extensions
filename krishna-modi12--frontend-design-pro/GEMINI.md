# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this repo is

`frontend-design-pro` is a **skill pack for AI agents**, not an application. The deliverable is a `.skill` archive (a zip of markdown + TypeScript examples) that a host agent unzips and reads. Nothing here "runs" in the usual sense except `demo/showcase/`.

The product's entire claim is that it is **verified rather than asserted**: every number in the docs is derived from a green gate chain, and every example is machine-checked against 61 constraints. When a change and a gate disagree, the gate is right. If a change requires relaxing a gate to land, the change is wrong.

Because of that claim, the standing posture here is **judge before building**. Read [`docs/REVIEW_PROTOCOL.md`](docs/REVIEW_PROTOCOL.md) at the start of a session: it carries the five-minute spot check, the list of things no gate can see, and the severity ladder. Every release this project has had to correct was corrected for prose, not for code.

## Commands

```bash
npm run gates        # python scripts/build_release.py --dry-run  — all 11 gates, builds nothing. THE check.
npm run build        # full gated release: gates + archive + smoke test + release notes
npm run typecheck    # Gate 3 only — tsc --noEmit strict over every example
npm run constraints  # Gate 5 only — 44 regex constraints over catalog/
npm run figures      # Gate 11 only — every documented count/token figure vs the filesystem
npm run figures:test # proof that Gate 11's patterns read the prose forms people write
npm run hooks:test   # proof that the pre-commit guard sees every dirty porcelain state
npm run evals        # 22 eval cases, self-test
npm run regression   # 16 synthetic parser-vs-regex divergence cases
npm test             # Gate 7's runtime half — 45 files, 232 tests, ~35s
npm run banner:check # the README banner still draws the current figures
```

**`npm run gates` alone is not enough before you push.** Two artifacts are
*generated* from the figures and checked only in CI, by re-rendering and
byte-comparing: the README banner (`.github/assets/router.svg`) and `home/`'s
data file (`home/lib/data.generated.json`, which carries the band, the depth
and every per-skill budget — `.github/pages/data.js` before `home/` replaced
the static page it fed). Gate 11 cannot police either — its patterns match
inside markup and JSON, but every hit dies in the forbid look-back window,
which in markup is attribute soup rather than sentence.

So any change that moves a figure leaves a green 11/11 locally and a red `gates`
job on the PR. The frontmatter migration that added `metadata:` nesting did it
twice: once for the banner, then again for the Pages data file after a merge
brought a reference-depth change in from `origin/main`. That same shape
recurred verifying `home/`'s own PR — a merge landed after `home/`'s figures
were already written, moving reference depth by a full sweep's worth in one
step, and the fix was the same two commands below, not a hand-edit. After any
figure sweep run both, and commit what they write:

```bash
npm run banner && npm run pages:data
npm run banner:check && npm run pages:data:check   # what CI will assert
```

Renderer-level checks, for when you touch anything under `demo/` or `home/`.
These need a browser and real vendor libraries, so they live in
`tools/screenshots/` (its own package.json, absent from the archive manifest).
**Every rendered surface this repo publishes is now checked in CI, and both
jobs are blocking.** `home-renderer` runs `pages:verify`; `demo-renderer` runs
`demos:verify` and then `showcase:verify`, which are two commands because the
harness is split — `demos:verify`'s `ROUTES` mounts the three stub-typed demos
inside the `tools/screenshots` app and never touches `demo/showcase`, a
standalone app with its own install. Run only the first and you skip the demo
with the WebGL hero and the only real interactive flow in `demo/`.
`demos:typecheck` runs in `demo-renderer` too, ahead of the browser
download so a type error costs no Chromium install. **`screenshots` is the
one that stays manual** — it writes files rather than checking them, so CI
has nothing to assert about it that a reviewer's eye does not:

```bash
npm run demos:verify     # page errors · console errors · hydration · axe WCAG 2.1 AA
                         # · overflow at 390/768/1920 — dev AND production, both schemes
npm run demos:typecheck  # the demos against REAL vendor typings, not demo/_stubs.d.ts
npm run showcase:verify  # demo/showcase: the same, plus the pricing-to-contact flow
npm run pages:verify     # home/: the same renderer checks, dev AND production, plus
                         # whether the router and the checker do what the copy says
npm run screenshots      # regenerate every image README.md links
```

`pages:verify` starts `home/`'s own dev and production servers — it needs the
app built (or `npm install`ed for dev), unlike the static page it replaced. It
is worth knowing what the equivalent check found the first time it ran against
`home/`, because none of it was visible in source: `text-accent` on the
checker's active-toggle button and its finding badges measured 4.36:1 against
their tinted background, under the 4.5 AA floor axe was run at; the install
command's `<code>` block scrolled horizontally with no way to reach that
scroll from a keyboard (axe's `scrollable-region-focusable`); and the hero's
canvas particle field, sized from an independently-guessed font size and wrap
width instead of the real headline's own computed layout, rendered as a
misaligned near-duplicate of the text sitting behind it — visible only in a
screenshot, since nothing about the mismatch would raise a type error or fail
a constraint. A green gate chain said nothing about any of these.

Single-file checks while iterating on an example (much faster than the full chain):

```bash
node scripts/parser_constraints.js catalog/<id>/examples/good-x.tsx   # 17 AST constraints, one file
python scripts/test_constraints.py catalog/<id>/examples/good-x.tsx   # 44 regex constraints, one file
python scripts/test_constraints.py --dir <path> --component          # consumer mode: drops the 8 page-scoped rules
python scripts/build_release.py --bump-patch                          # patch bump + gates + build
```

**`npm test` (vitest) runs and must stay green** — Gate 7 runs it, so a red suite blocks the build. The examples' ~25 peer libraries are still not installed; `test/stubs/` supplies one runtime module per specifier and `vitest.config.ts` aliases them.

Three rules from `test/stubs/README.md`, because each was learned from a silent failure:

- **One file per specifier.** A module has one `default` export (`gsap` and `@splinetool/react-spline` both want it), a namespace import reads every name in the file (`import * as z from 'zod'`), and `vi.mock` keys on the *resolved* path — so aliasing three specifiers to one file makes their mocks collide.
- **Never return a bare `new Proxy({}, { get })` from a `vi.mock` factory.** The trap answers `then`, so `await factory()` treats it as a thenable, calls it, and never settles. The module never loads and the worker is killed — reported as `Error: Worker exited unexpectedly`, which reads like memory pressure and is not.
- **If a stub takes an ARIA role, it owns that role's name.** `role="dialog"` without `aria-labelledby` is an axe violation the real Radix component does not have, and emitting one fails a gold for a defect that exists only in the stub.

`docs/TESTING.md` carries the per-file history and what the suite does and does not prove.

`scripts/build_release.py` is the **only supported way** to produce an archive. Do not zip by hand.

## No gate renders anything

Every gate reads source. None of them starts a browser, and the gap is not
theoretical — a stylesheet that silently did nothing, a resolver typed as `any`,
a page that scrolled 73px sideways at 390px and a chart hidden from screen
readers but still in the tab order all passed a green 9/9 chain. `npm run
demos:verify` is what catches that class, and it is the check to run when a demo
changes.

The same blindness applies to `demo/_stubs.d.ts`. Its job is to type OUR code
without vendoring libraries, but a stub loose enough to accept anything makes the
gate that uses it decorative: `z.infer` once resolved to `any`, which forced a
hand-written duplicate of a zod schema's output type, which then drifted from it.
When a stub covers a seam where two things have to agree — a schema and a form, a
resolver and its values — model the relationship. `demo/auth-form/lib/validation.contract.ts`
asserts the result at compile time, `IsAny` tripwire included.

## Architecture: registry + lazy loading

A monolithic pack of ~344k tokens cannot be loaded at all, so the pack is not a document — it is a **registry that routes**.

| Tier | Loaded |
|---|---|
| `SKILL.md` (root) | **Always.** Identity, anti-slop wall, the routing table, loading protocol. |
| `core/*.md` (8 files) | The 3–4 a matched skill declares in its frontmatter `metadata.core-deps`. |
| `catalog/{id}/SKILL.md` | Exactly one per request, chosen by trigger-keyword match. |
| `catalog/{id}/references/*.md` | Only when the skill file's own Reference Index points at one. |

A request loads roughly 6,042–7,956 tokens against ~436k of available depth. **Gate 8a hard-fails the build** if any skill exceeds 3,000 tokens alone or 8,000 with deps, so the budget is not advisory. Token count is `file size in bytes ÷ 4`.

`AGENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT.md` is an optional drop-in system prompt scored by the Pipeline gate (`scripts/test_v12_pipeline.py`) — it checks stage markers, architecture claims, and that every path it cites resolves. Edit it only with that gate in mind.

## Adding or changing a skill — the contract

Six requirements, each enforced by a different gate. Missing any one fails the build:

1. **Frontmatter** must declare `name` and `description` at the top level, and `version` plus `core-deps` nested under `metadata:` — Anthropic's own validator rejects any other top-level key, so pack-specific fields live under the one key its schema reserves for them. `metadata.version` must **exactly equal `metadata.json`'s version** (Gate 2). A new skill declares the *current* version, not the version you plan to release under.
2. **A registry row** in the root `SKILL.md`, matching this shape exactly — the parser regex requires the deps cell to hold **exactly one** backticked `core/*.md`. Two deps in that cell means the row is not parsed and the skill silently becomes an orphan:
   `| `id` | `catalog/id/SKILL.md` | keywords | `core/one-dep.md` |`
   (The skill's own YAML `metadata.core-deps:` may still list several.)
3. **`catalog/{id}/examples/` must contain at least one `*.tsx`** (Gate 8b). A markdown-only examples directory fails.
4. **Every `good-*.tsx` needs a 1:1 `good-*.test.tsx`** (Gate 7), and both must compile strict.
5. **Every `references/*.md` must be cited** in that skill's Reference Index, or path integrity warns about an orphan — a reference nothing routes to can never be loaded, so it ships as dead weight.
6. **Every `references/*.md` over 300 lines needs a `## Contents` index**, and every anchor in it must resolve (Stage 3). Anthropic's skill-creator asks for this and the reason is progressive disclosure: an agent that loads a 1,400-line file with no index has to read all of it to find one section. `markdown_links()` skips `#` targets, so a Contents entry left pointing at a renamed heading is invisible to every other check.

**Paths written in prose are addressed from a root, not from the file they sit
in.** Which root depends on what is being cited, and both forms are correct:

| Citing | Write | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Another skill's reference | skill id first, `catalog/` implied | `animations/references/motion.md` |
| A shared or top-level file | from the pack root | `core/agent-behavior.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` |
| This skill's own reference | `references/` first | `references/{name}.md` |
| A same-directory sibling | bare | `motion-budget.md` |

The skill-id form is the same shape `SKILL.md`'s loading protocol uses for
`catalog/{id}/SKILL.md`, minus the prefix the reader is already inside.

**Do not "fix" these to `../../`.** Nothing resolves them against the file's own
directory; an agent reads them from the unzipped pack. A reviewer who assumes
filesystem-relative will report every one as broken — that has happened, and the
"fix" was applied in the wrong direction before being caught.

`prose_paths()` in Stage 3 now checks every one of them, so a dead citation
fails the build. It understands the four forms above plus `frontend-design-pro/…`
(the unzipped archive) and `_meta/CHANGELOG.md` (where `build_release.py`
relocates the changelog). It deliberately ignores bare filenames — `motion.md`
is shorthand for "the reference named motion", not a path — and `docs/CHANGELOG.md`,
which quotes paths that were true when written. `npm run paths:test` holds its
fixtures.

Copy `_stubs.d.ts` and `_r3f-jsx.d.ts` into a new `examples/` directory from any existing skill.

`python scripts/scaffold.py <intent>` generates differentiated component boilerplate by intent type.

**The frontmatter matches Anthropic's published schema, and Gate 2 re-applies
their rules.** `skill-creator`'s `quick_validate.py` allows six top-level keys —
`name`, `description`, `license`, `allowed-tools`, `metadata`, `compatibility` —
and errors on anything else. All 19 skills used to declare `version` and
`core-deps` at the top level and failed it, while the root `SKILL.md` passed;
`package_skill.py` runs that validator before zipping, so the official packager
would have refused every sub-skill. Both keys now nest under `metadata:`, the key
the schema reserves for exactly this, and `SPEC_KEYS` in `build_release.py`
enforces the same six so a new key cannot drift back out.

Worth knowing before you trust that gate: `_frontmatter()` used to partition each
line on ":" without ever reading indentation, so top-level `version:` and
`metadata.version:` parsed identically. **Gate 2 printed the same green line
before and after the 19-file migration it exists to police** — nesting alone
would have "passed" without the gate ever seeing the shape. It reads indentation
now and consumes folded scalars, so a colon inside a wrapped `description:` can
no longer invent a top-level key either. The cost is measured, not free:
`metadata:` plus two indent levels adds ~5 tokens to every skill, and
`design-research` — the tightest — now sits just 73 tokens under the Gate 8a
ceiling.

## The rules no gate reads

The 61 constraints check code. **Each skill's own "Core Rules" section is checked
by nothing**, and one of them was contradicted by the very example the skill
names first: `data-tables` rule 5 says filters, sort and page live in the URL,
and `good-data-table.tsx` held all three in `useState` for its whole life while
passing 42/42 and 17/17. That matters more than a stale figure, because
`CLAUDE.md` tells you to write new golds by modelling closely on an existing
one — so the gold is the thing that actually propagates. It is fixed and has
three tests asserting the rule, but nothing stops the next one drifting.

**When you add or edit a Core Rule, read the skill's golds against it.** A rule
demonstrated wrong is worse than a rule not written down: the prose gets skimmed,
the example gets copied.

**The always-loaded wall was enforced by nothing for half its contents.** The ban
list in `SKILL.md` names four placeholder brand names — Acme, Cloudly, SmartFlow,
Nexus — and no constraint read them, so two gold examples shipped "Acme Inc." and
`catalog/platform/references/email-templates.md` taught it seventeen times, in a
worked example built to be copied. `SLOP-05` reads them now; `SLOP-01` picked up
`user123` and `$99.99`, which the wall names in the same breath as John Doe.
Still unenforced from that same line, and worth a manual look: equal-height card
grids, `<div>`-built fake screenshots, and numbered `01/02/03` markers on content
that is not a sequence. (Gradient fills used to be a separate, unscoped claim on
this line too — it now just restates `TYP-03`, which the regex suite already
enforces, so it dropped off this list.) **Custom cursors were on this list until
now and should not have been:** `SLOP-06` has banned `cursor-none` and
`cursor: url(...)` for a release, and the file every session is told to read
first was sending readers to check by hand something the suite already fails.
This list is hand-maintained and no gate reads it — re-derive it from
`CONSTRAINTS` before trusting it, the same way you would any figure here.
**Before widening a rule to a reference file, note that the suites read
`.tsx/.ts/.js/.jsx/.html` only** — 436,284 tokens of markdown depth is outside
every content check except Gate 10's 19 ban-shaped fragments.

## Examples are gate-bearing artifacts

`catalog/*/examples/good-*.tsx` are not illustrations — they are the fixtures the constraint suites run against, and they must pass all 61 checks (17 AST via the TypeScript compiler API + 44 regex). `bad-*.tsx` are deliberate anti-examples that **must fail**; the suite asserts both directions.

Write new golds by modelling closely on an existing one (`catalog/landing-pages/examples/good-landing.tsx` is the fullest). The recurring requirements: OKLCH only (no raw hex, no `[#...]`), `min-h-[100dvh]` never `min-h-screen`, a declared font (`Manrope`/system stack — never Inter/Roboto/Poppins as the display face), all four states with no `setTimeout` fake loader, a functional `useReducedMotion`, ease-out for entrances, a skip link on anything with `<nav>`/`<header>`, 44px touch targets, organic data values, an exported `*Props` interface that is actually *used* as a type, and `…` not `...`.

`demo/showcase/` is the exception to everything above: a real, installed Next.js app verified by Gate 9 running `next build` against actual vendor typings. `demo/tsconfig.json` deliberately excludes it from the stub-typed regime.

## Traps that will fail your build

- **Version-leak scan.** Pre-flight fails if the *current* version string appears in any file outside an allowlist: `metadata.json`, `README.md`, `package.json`, `docs/CHANGELOG.md`, anything under `catalog/`, `.github/workflows/`, `demo/showcase/`, `home/lib/data.generated.json` (generated fresh from `metadata.json` on every run — the rest of `home/` is not exempt), and any `RELEASE_NOTES-*`. **This file is not on that list** — never write the current version literal into `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/MAINTENANCE.md`, or any other doc. A *branch name* containing the version counts as a leak too.
- **Version bumps touch six places**, and this entry said *three*, then *five*, through the releases burned by each one it was missing. Gates 1–2 and Gate 11 fail on any being out of step: `metadata.json`'s `version`, **its own `changelog` map in the same file** (a version → prose object, newest first — the head release having no entry is two Gate 11 drifts), a new top `## [x.y.z]` header in `docs/CHANGELOG.md`, the `version:` line in **every** `catalog/*/SKILL.md`, `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, and the `## What's new in vX` heading in `README.md`. There is no `--bump-minor`. `--bump-patch` writes the first four and deliberately leaves the README heading alone — a stub there would put a new version above the previous release's prose, which reads as current and is a worse lie than a stale heading. It prints what it did not do; read that line. **Only Stage 6 checks the README heading, and Stage 6 does not run under `--dry-run`**, so an 11/11 dry run cannot catch this one.
- **Published figures are LF measurements.** `.gitattributes` is `eol=lf`, so the git index is LF and that byte count is canonical — it is what CI, the `.skill` archive and every doc figure use. Both `build_release.py:tokens()` and `check_figures.py:tokens()` LF-normalise, so Gate 8a and Gate 11 agree on Windows and Linux alike — even for a file an editor has rewritten to CRLF and you have not yet committed. Still: do not "correct" a doc figure to something a local tool printed before this was true.
- **Documented figures are gated now — run `npm run figures` before you argue with it.** Counts and token figures hardcoded across ~30 documents going stale silently was the single most repeated defect in this repo's history, and several releases exist only to correct it. Gate 11 (`scripts/check_figures.py`) recomputes every figure from the filesystem and fails the build on any document that disagrees, so a count change no longer depends on remembering the sweep list. It also checks that stated deltas subtract correctly — `A → B … C tokens` where `B - A ≠ C` is the shape that kept slipping through, when a blanket substitution moved an endpoint and left the delta behind. (Writing that example with real numbers fails the gate, which is the gate working.) It reads **across hard wraps** — prose here is wrapped at ~80 characters, and a line-by-line scan cannot see `35 regex` / `constraints` split over the fold, which is how a *public* triage document sat seven wrong while the gate called it clean. It also catches gate counts **spelled as words**. What it still cannot see: anything in a document outside `SCAN`, and spelled-out counts for nouns other than gates — a deliberate omission, since "when two skills match" and "adding two skills cost 113 tokens" mean subsets, not the corpus, and a gate that shouts about those gets muted. **A figure it cannot see is worse than one it gets wrong, because a green run reads as proof.** That has now happened three times, and the third time all three tracked launch documents held a superseded router size while the gate reported 0 drift. `scripts/figure_pattern_test.py` (`npm run figures:test`) is what holds the patterns to the prose forms people actually write — 76 prose fixtures over 12 figures, asserting in both directions, blocking in the chain. **Extend it in the same commit as any pattern change**, and keep the negative cases: a widening that flags a correct file is a regression wearing a fix's clothes, and one of these fixtures exists because the registry anchor briefly read the *per-skill* router range out of `catalog/{id}/SKILL.md`.

- **The constraint roster is checked against the suites now, and `--self-test` is not where that check lives.** `core/validate-checklist.md` is the list an agent is told to self-check against, and it is maintained by hand. It drifted twice: a `## Regex-enforced (N)` heading six short of the real count, then — in the commit that fixed *that* — a corrected heading above a roster still ending one ID early, and a closing `**Total:**` line still carrying the previous release's numbers in a prose shape ("machine-enforced", not "constraints") no figure pattern matches. `roster_check()` in `test_constraints.py` compares the listed IDs and all four numbers in that Total line against `CONSTRAINTS` and `PARSER_CHECK_IDS`, and runs on **every** invocation rather than under `--self-test`, because `test_constraints.py --self-test` is not in the release chain. Only IDs above `## Self-checks` are compared; `BEHAV-01`–`04` are correctly listed there and enforced by nothing.

- **A waived constraint prints its waiver on every run, and a claim about waivers is itself checked.** `GRANDFATHERED` in `test_constraints.py` carried `demo/showcase` → `SLOP-05` for most of the showcase's life, because the demo was named Nexus and the rename was deferred. The waiver was echoed with its reason in the summary line on every run so it could not quietly become permanent, and the demo is renamed now, so the dict is empty. What replaced it is the more useful half: three documents state that nothing is waived, so `grandfathered_check()` runs on **every** invocation and fails if an entry returns while `CLAIMS_NO_WAIVERS` still points at prose saying otherwise. Adding a waiver back is allowed and sometimes right — it is deliberately a four-file act, because the pages that advertise the emptiness have to stop in the same commit.

**Blind spots still open, each found with a stale figure sitting in it, so check these by hand after any sweep:** a figure written `N files` rather than `N references` is unmatched (widening it to `files` would catch "20 knowledge files per GPT" on the same row, which is why it was not); the `REFERENCES` forbid reads a 50-character window backwards and so misfires on a *table row* whose preceding cell ends in a backticked path, suppressing a real corpus claim; the per-skill budget table in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` lists values one per line, which no range pattern can read (`RANGE` now matches `A to B` as well as a dashed pair, but not a column); `DEPTH`'s trailing `(?![\d,])` — there to avoid biting into a longer number — also drops any depth figure a sentence happens to follow with a comma; and the `k`-rounded depth figure is now gated by `DEPTH-K` **only where the noun says so** — "references" or "depth" resolves to `reference_depth_tokens`; "a monolithic pack of ~Nk tokens" is deliberately left unclaimed, because nothing computes a whole-pack total and a pattern that grabbed it would fail `README.md` for telling the truth. Two negative fixtures hold that line. This entry previously said the whole family was ungateable; that was true of the family and false of six of its members, one of which was `AGENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT.md`. **The constraint split had one readable form and the corpus writes four** — `(P parser + R regex)` with no `AST`, `P semantic + R syntactic = T` with no brackets, and `(P AST via the TypeScript compiler API + R regex)` with a clause in the middle were all invisible, and twelve surfaces carried a stale half through the sweep that corrected everything the gate could read. All four are matched now, along with the halves counted as `checks` and the `**Syntactic (R regex)**` heading form. **Two further shapes were closed after they shipped stale on the front door itself**: a qualifier sitting between the digits and the noun (`N machine-checked constraints` — the README's opening sentence), and a **total stated immediately before its own split** (`N (P AST + R regex)`), where the split validated cleanly while contradicting the total printed beside it on the same line. Both had survived the sweep that corrected the checklist they were quoting, which is the recurring shape of this defect: the gate reads the source of a figure and not the sentence that repeats it. Deliberately still unclaimed: a **bare** `N checks`, because gate chains, evals and CI jobs all count checks and a pattern that grabbed those would shout on every one; the comma-separated split (`P AST …, R regex`) had one instance and was reworded to `+` instead of widened for. **In markup, emphasis around a figure disables the gate.** `GLOBAL_FORBID` lists a bare `<` and `>` among the comparison operators, so that a bound (`≤ N tokens`) is correctly read as a limit rather than a measurement — but the look-back is 50 characters of raw text, and the `>` that closes *any* HTML tag lands in it. `<strong>N skills</strong>` is therefore suppressed by its own opening tag and silently unguarded, as is every figure written immediately after any tag at all. The gate reports no drift on such a page because it never read it. `.github/pages/index.html` used to carry this workaround — wrapping emphasis around the *sentence* and never around the number, with a comment at each site saying why — before `home/` replaced it with the same figures rendered as JSX expressions (`{figures.ciConstraints}`, no literal digit in the source for the tag to sit next to) or, where a figure is spelled out in prose, as a plain string in `home/lib/content.ts` with no adjacent markup at all. Neither needs the workaround, but the underlying defeat is unchanged and still live wherever a figure sits in real HTML/JSX markup — `docs/audit-report.html` is exactly that shape. Do not narrow the rule to fix this: `docs/audit-report.html` says `10 References` as the *name* of gate ten, and a tighter window flags that correct file. Found by corrupting each figure in turn on a page the gate had just called clean — which is the only way this class is ever found, and the fourth time it has been found here. **Write shapes, not digits, when documenting a pattern** — the three examples above were first written with real numbers and the gate flagged this file, correctly. **Leave `docs/RELEASE_NOTES-*` and prior `CHANGELOG.md` entries alone** — they were accurate when cut, rewriting them falsifies the record, and the gate exempts them for that reason.

## Git discipline

Two concurrent agent sessions against this working directory caused three bad releases; the whole story is in `docs/MAINTENANCE.md` § "Unattended writers". Consequences that bind you:

- **Never `git add -A`.** Stage explicit paths.
- `.githooks/pre-commit` blocks any commit adding **5+ new files** and prints the list, so you cannot sweep another writer's work in by accident. It fires for the lock owner too — that is the point. Override with `FDP_ALLOW_CONCURRENT=1 git commit …` only after confirming every listed path is yours. Install with `git config core.hooksPath .githooks` (per-clone, cannot be committed).
- The same hook also prints, without blocking, every dirty path **not** in the commit you are making. That is the half the added-file threshold misses: the last collision was 13 modified files and 3 new ones, so nothing would have tripped and `git add -A` would have taken all sixteen. The rule is one
  column wide — a non-blank *worktree* column in `git status --porcelain` — so it
  covers a file staged and then **edited again** (`MM`), which is the most
  misleading state there is: green in `git status`, and the commit carries only
  the older half. Written as a list of spellings it saw 3 of the 11 dirty states.
  `guard_dirty_outside_commit` in `.githooks/session-guard.sh` is the one
  definition; `npm run hooks:test` holds its fixtures, both directions.
- **If another session is live in this tree, stop staging and branch the work out:** `git worktree add <dir> origin/main`, copy in only the files you wrote, and re-run the figure sweep and the generators *there*. A shared tree also corrupts what the gates tell you — Stage 3 will report the other session's broken links as yours, and an untracked `docs/RELEASE_NOTES-*` inflates Gate 11's claim-surface count by one. `docs/MAINTENANCE.md` § "Unattended writers" has the full account.
- `git fetch` and check `git log --oneline -1` before every commit, tag and push.

Releases: tag must be annotated (`git tag -a`). Pushing a `v*` tag fires `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which re-runs all 11 gates on a clean runner and publishes a public GitHub Release with the archive attached — so the tag push is the irreversible step, not the commit.

## Policy

`docs/MAINTENANCE.md` holds a feature freeze with explicit lift thresholds (10 distinct enhancement requests, 5 confirmed bugs, or a date). It is currently **overridden by owner directive**, recorded in that file. The default answer to "should we build X" is still *no, not yet*, and the burden is on evidence — new skills, references, examples, constraints and gates are the named forbidden category during a freeze.

`install/` holds **consumer-facing adapters** (`.cursor/rules/*.mdc`, `copilot-instructions.md`, etc.) that ship inside the archive for other hosts. They are shipped artifacts, not rules governing development of this repo.
