# agentic-engineering

A portable package of the agentic engineering protocol for AI-assisted software development. It provides a structured delegation model, risk classification, adversarial review loops, code quality gates, git workflow conventions, and named agent definitions.

## Decisions
- Methodology source-of-truth lives in `content/sections/01-*.md` through `12-*.md` (P2 added `06-capability-preflight.md`; sections formerly 06-11 are now 07-12). The legacy `content/rules/agent-methodology.md` path no longer exists - edit `content/sections/` for any methodology change.
- `scripts/build-methodology.sh` is the canonical methodology assembly script. Adapter builds (`.claude/build.sh`, `.codex/build.sh`, `.gemini/build.sh`, `.kimi/build.sh`) invoke it via `bash "$REPO_DIR/scripts/build-methodology.sh"`. `.cursor/build.sh` has a different output structure and does not use it.
- `.claude/install.sh` manages `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` via a `managed_content` Python string (lines ~364-380). Four @-import lines (METHODOLOGY.md plus 3 rules files under `rules/`) must appear in that string or rules will not auto-inject in Claude Code sessions. Re-run install.sh after any changes to that string.
- `bootstrap.sh` (repo root, PR #109) is the public `curl | bash` installer: clones to `$(pwd)/DinoStack` (override `AE_DEST_DIR`), writes the resolved path to `~/.agentic/agentic-engineering-config.json` (`repo_dir`). `/update-agentic-engineering` reads `repo_dir` at runtime (git-rev-parse validated, falls back to `~/DinoStack`) for location-aware updates.
- `skill_auto_load` opt-in enforcement (PR #97): shared hook `hooks/skill-auto-load-check.sh` wired per adapter - Claude and Codex: UserPromptSubmit; Gemini: BeforeAgent; Kimi: SessionStart. OpenCode uses a `session.created` plugin in `.opencode/plugins/session-context.ts`. Cursor has no hook (loaded via .mdc). All install scripts use read-modify-write for config updates; bare overwrite destroys existing keys. OpenCode reads from `~/.config/opencode/agentic-engineering.json`; all other adapters read from `~/.claude/agentic-engineering.json`.
- FE/QA methodology (P0+P1+P2) shipped 2026-05-28 in 14 PRs (#137-#140, #142-#145, #149-#154). `qa_criteria.method` enum is now 7 values: `browser`, `api`, `runtime-required`, `visual_conformance`, `accessibility`, `perceptual_diff`, `motion`. Capability preflight default is `blocking` as of P2 (9 agents populated; skeptic + orchestration-planner are deliberate no-ops). Canonical new reference docs: `content/references/capability-preflight.md` and `content/references/frontend-discipline.md` (7 sections + 8 Skeptic finding categories). Motion scenarios require Playwright (CDP `Emulation.setEmulatedMedia`); agent-browser cannot execute them. Storybook 6 ships URL format detection only; full SB6 framework adapter procedure improvements are deferred.
- Project-level identity override (2026-06-12): `agentic-identity --scope project` writes `<repo>/.agentic/identity.yml`; effective identity resolves by a 4-tier confirmation-first precedence (project-confirmed > global-confirmed > project-provisional > global-provisional > none); gitignored per-developer; resolver implemented in `bin/agentic-identity` + `hooks/stop-context.js` with 5 regression tests in `bin/tests/test_agentic_identity.py`.
- Telemetry-commit-on-PR (2026-06-12): the `commit_telemetry` toggle in `.agentic/config.json` (default true) makes `/implement-ticket` Phase 8 commit `.agentic/session-log/<dev>.jsonl` as a separate commit when a confirmed identity exists; `.agentic/session-log/` is git-tracked via the `!.agentic/session-log/` carve-out in `.gitignore`. Path-aware PR-checkout resolution + a HEAD-branch soft-fail guard ensure it never commits to the wrong branch. Eventual-consistency: a session's own line lands in the next ticket's Phase 8 commit; non-`/implement-ticket` PRs are not covered.

## Tools
- GitHub operations: use `gh` CLI - do not use GitHub MCP
- `gh pr create` requires an authenticated `gh` session (`gh auth status`). Run `gh auth login` if needed, then `gh pr create`.
- `rm -rf` is blocked by Claude Code permissions in this repo; remove files individually: `rm <file>` then `rmdir <dir>`
- `bin/agentic-memory` — lightweight memory retrieval tool for querying `.agentic/events.jsonl`, `MEMORY.md`, and `.agentic/context.md` on demand.

## Deploy
- Docs site: deploy steps are in `docs/technical/deploy.md` (local-only, not tracked upstream). Always verify the linked project ID before running `vercel --prod`.

## Conventions
- **Workflow for all implementation work (non-Trivial risk):**
	1. `git fetch origin` to ensure latest `main`.
	2. Spawn subagent Workers using `isolation: "worktree"` with worktrees branched from `origin/main`. Worktree path: `.agentic/worktrees/<branch-name>`.
	3. Worker implements, runs quality gates (lint, typecheck, tests), commits.
	4. Push branch to origin: `git push -u origin <branch-name>`.
	5. Open PR against `main` via `gh pr create`.
	6. Once CI/CD checks pass, auto-merge: `gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch`.
	7. Clean up: `git worktree remove --force <path>`, `git branch -D <branch-name>`, `git worktree prune`.
	8. Update local main: `git checkout main && git pull --ff-only origin main`.
	- Steps 6-8 are automatic - never pause for merge approval when CI is green.
	- Failed CI is a hard stop - investigate before proceeding.
- **Conductor never edits shippable artifacts directly, including Trivial one-line changes.** Every shippable change is delegated to a worktree-isolated `engineer` branched from `origin/main`; the conductor edits only exempt artifacts (`.agentic/`, conductor-direct prints/decisions/resolver execution) in its own checkout. See `content/rules/conventions.md` §Git Workflow for the shippable/exempt classifier.
- When isolation:worktree Workers are used across multiple sequential spawns in the same task, the worktree is cleaned up between them and subsequent Workers fall back to the main tree. Tell follow-up Workers this explicitly.
- When spawning parallel engineer units, each spawn brief must explicitly say "branch your worktree from current `origin/main`, NOT a local checkout that may include not-yet-merged sibling units." Worktree branch leaks (commits landing on the wrong unit's branch) are the most common cross-unit contamination class when parent units have not yet merged.
- When you struggle with a repeatable task (starting dev servers, deploying, running migrations, connecting to databases, etc.) and find the solution, proactively save the working steps to MEMORY.md so future sessions don't repeat the struggle.
- The pre-commit hook does not currently auto-stage `.claude/skills/agentic-engineering/METHODOLOGY.md` or `.codex/agents/*.toml`. After any `content/` edit, either stage these regenerated artifacts manually or extend the `git add` list in `hooks/pre-commit`.
- Any change to `content/rules/`, `content/references/`, `content/agents/`, `content/commands/`, or `content/sections/` MUST also update `docs/index.html` and any affected `docs/slides/*.md` (then run `bash scripts/build-slides.sh` and commit the regenerated `.html` - do not hand-edit the `.html`; upgrading marp is an intentional same-PR action: bump `scripts/package.json` + regenerate `scripts/package-lock.json` + rebuild) in the same PR; additionally, any now-stale count, list, or reference in `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, or `content/SKILL.md` is in-scope for the same PR. Public-facing intent debt is the worst kind. The canonical trigger predicate and tiered Skeptic classification for this obligation live in `content/references/doc-sync-obligation.md`; Skeptic flags missing docs sync per those tiers (Major by default, Critical when a public-facing doc actively misleads).
- Any new interactive prompt added to `.claude/install.sh` MUST use the `ae_confirm()` helper (reads `/dev/tty` when available, defaults "no"). Never use bare `read -p` - it aborts under `set -euo pipefail` + piped stdin (the `curl | bash` install path).
- After any change to `content/SKILL.md`, run both `.pi/build.sh` and `.claude/build.sh` to regenerate adapter-specific SKILL.md copies. The pre-commit hook does not auto-stage these.
