## Activation preflight

Run this check once at the top of the first skill invocation in a session (and at the top of every `/`-command in `content/commands/`). It is fast, silent when active, and governs whether the methodology runs at all in the current project. Keep it to three file reads with no subagent spawn and no LLM reasoning. **Exception:** Step 6 (Scaffolding-sync check) is the single authorized side-effecting exception to this invariant. It calls `bin/agentic-migrate` as a bounded shell-out; the binary is methodology-owned, failure is swallowed, and it never blocks activation.

1. **Read the global mode, profile, and preset.** Load `~/.claude/agentic-engineering.json`. If missing or unreadable, assume `mode=opt-out`, `profile=default`, and `preset=null` (back-compat). Expected shape: `{ "mode": "opt-out" | "opt-in", "profile": "relaxed" | "default" | "strict", "preset": "lean" | "standard" | "strict" | null, "set_at": "<ISO8601>" }`. Any `mode` value other than `opt-in` is treated as `opt-out`. Any `profile` value other than `relaxed` or `strict` is treated as `default`. The `preset` field is optional; when present and non-null, it RESOLVES to a profile via the preset table below and overrides the direct `profile` field. When `preset` is null or missing, the direct `profile` field is used (back-compat).

   Also read the **effective identity** for this session. Check `<cwd>/.agentic/identity.yml` first, then fall back to `~/.agentic/identity.yml`. Use the first file that exists, resolving by the 4-tier confirmation ordering: project-confirmed > global-confirmed > project-provisional > global-provisional > none. In practice this is a two-file read: if the project file exists and is confirmed (no `provisional: true`), use it. If the project file is provisional, also read the global file; if the global is confirmed, prefer the global. Otherwise use the project file. Record `developer_id` and `provisional` from whichever file wins. Absent file or absent `provisional` field = confirmed identity (Python `.get('provisional', False)`; JS `provisional === true`). **This is a read-only field parse - no prompt, no shell-out, no LLM reasoning. The "fast, silent" preflight invariant is preserved.** When `provisional: true` is recorded on the effective identity, the conductor surfaces a non-blocking confirmation notice at its first user-facing turn (see §Session Context and Memory in `content/rules/conventions.md`).

   **Preset table (session-wide risk profile preset):**

   | Preset    | Resolves to profile |
   |-----------|---------------------|
   | lean      | relaxed             |
   | standard  | default             |
   | strict    | strict              |

   Note: this session-wide `preset` field is distinct from the per-spawn `Preset:` declaration introduced in the Tier declaration section below. The session-wide preset is a tone setting; the per-spawn preset is a capability bundle. Both terms use "preset" intentionally - context disambiguates.
2. **Read the project marker.** Look for a root `AGENTS.md` in the current working directory. If the project uses the Claude Code `@AGENTS.md` import pattern, `CLAUDE.md` will point at it - resolve through to the actual `AGENTS.md`. If neither file exists, treat marker as `none`.
3. **Scan for marker lines.** Case-insensitive, whole-line match (allow leading or trailing whitespace, and an optional markdown list prefix `- `):
   - `agentic-engineering: opt-in`
   - `agentic-engineering: opt-out`
   If both appear, the one that appears FIRST wins; print a one-line warning: `agentic-engineering: both opt-in and opt-out markers found in AGENTS.md - using the first one (<value>). Remove the duplicate.`
   Also scan for `agentic-engineering-profile: <value>`. If present, it overrides the global profile. Valid values: `relaxed`, `default`, `strict`. Any other value falls back to the global profile.
   Also scan for `agentic-engineering-preset: <value>`. If present, it overrides the resolved global preset for this project. Valid values: `lean`, `standard`, `strict`. The project preset is resolved through the same preset table (above) to a profile; that resolved profile overrides any direct `agentic-engineering-profile:` line in the same file (preset wins on collision because it is the higher-level knob). Any other value falls back to the global preset/profile resolution.
4. **Activation decision.**
   - `mode=opt-out` AND `marker=opt-out` - skill no-ops silently; fall back to default Claude Code behavior for this session.
   - `mode=opt-in` AND `marker != opt-in` - skill no-ops silently; fall back to default behavior.
   - Any other combination (including `marker=none` with `mode=opt-out`, or `marker=opt-in` with `mode=opt-in`) - proceed with the methodology.
5. **First-activation notice (one-time, per-project, TTY-only).** Triggered only when Step 4 resolved to active (any proceed branch). Otherwise skip this step entirely.

   **TTY/QUIET gate.** If `os.environ.get("AGENTIC_QUIET") == "1"` OR `not sys.stdout.isatty()`, skip BOTH the notice print AND the sentinel write. Activation proceeds normally without producing the notice or creating the sentinel. This prevents fixture contamination in eval harness runs and unwanted output in CI/headless contexts.

   **Sentinel write contract (race-safe; create-only).** Two parallel subagent activations on the same fresh project must produce exactly one notice and exactly one sentinel; the loser stays silent. The notice prints if and only if the create-only write succeeded.

   1. Compute path: `<project_root>/.agentic/.activated`.
   2. Ensure `.agentic/` exists (`mkdir -p`); failures silently swallowed - do not crash.
   3. Attempt **create-only** write (must fail if the file already exists):
      - Python: `open(path, 'x')` (raises `FileExistsError` if present).
      - Shell: write to `<path>.tmp.<pid>`, then `ln <tmp> <path>` (atomic, fails on EEXIST), unlink tmp.
      - <!-- Race-safe pattern: O_EXCL / link() guarantees that only one of N concurrent racers wins the create; losers see EEXIST and stay silent. Do NOT replace with `if exists: ... else: write` - that pattern has a TOCTOU race. -->
   4. **Print the notice if and only if the create succeeded.** On EEXIST (sentinel already present), skip the print silently. Losers in a race stay silent.
   5. Filesystem errors other than `EEXIST` (read-only filesystem, permission denied, ENOSPC, etc.) are silently swallowed; the notice may re-print on the next session. Methodology must not crash.

   **Sentinel body (exactly three lines, plain text):**
   ```
   # agentic-engineering: first-activation notice has been shown for this project.
   # Deleting this file re-arms the notice only; it does not change activation state.
   # To opt out, use /agentic-disable.
   ```

   **Notice text (verbatim, single line, printed to stdout when create succeeds):**
   ```
   agentic-engineering: active (mode=<mode>, marker=<marker or 'none'>, profile=<profile>, preset=<preset or 'none'>). Run /agentic-status to inspect, /agentic-disable to opt out.
   ```
   Values come from the resolver outputs of Steps 1-3. The literal JSON `null` for `preset` is rendered as the string `none`.

6. **Scaffolding-sync check.** Runs only when Step 4 resolved to active. Silent-fail: any error swallowed; methodology proceeds.

   a. Invoke `agentic-migrate check` (resolved from PATH or adapter install bin/). If binary not found: skip silently.
   b. If status is "ok" (project version >= manifest version): no-op.
   c. If status is "drift": invoke `agentic-migrate apply`. The binary acquires `~/.agentic/.scaffolding-apply.lock` (on EWOULDBLOCK: another session is applying - skip silently). It applies additive gitignore patterns (exact-line match, strip trailing whitespace), writes missing `.agentic/` seed files (never overwrites existing), updates `scaffolding_version` in `.agentic/config.json` when all additive rules satisfied, and appends one-line audit to `.agentic/context.md`. The `markers:` key in the manifest is IGNORED by this path (operator-owned; surface via `/migrate-project --include-destructive` only).
   d. AGENTS.md is never modified by this step. Operator-owned scaffolding requires `/migrate-project --include-destructive`.

7. **When no-opping, print one line and stop:**
   `agentic-engineering: inactive in this project (mode=<mode>, marker=<marker or 'none'>). Add 'agentic-engineering: opt-in' to AGENTS.md to activate.`
   Do not load rules. Do not spawn. Do not print anything else from this skill in this session.

**Graceful defaults:** missing `~/.claude/agentic-engineering.json`, missing `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`, malformed JSON, and permission errors all resolve to "mode=opt-out, marker=none, profile=default, preset=null" -> proceed with methodology active. This preserves behavior for users who installed before this feature existed.

**Skill/command references:** Every file in `content/commands/` begins with a one-line reminder to run this preflight and no-op if inactive. The check is performed once per session - subsequent `/`-commands in the same session can trust the earlier result.

## Delegation

**The main session agent is a conductor, not an implementer.** The conductor is the main session agent: it decomposes work, delegates to specialist subagents that do the implementation and investigation, and synthesizes results when those subagents report back. It stays available and focused on orchestration - responsive to the user at all times.

**All delegated tasks run in background by default.** Foreground is permitted only for direct-action cases in the table below. Never block inline - spawn in background, give the user a status update, and wait for completion notification. On Claude Code this rule is enforced by a `PreToolUse` hook (`hooks/enforce-background-spawn.py`, wired by `.claude/install.sh`) that denies any `Task` spawn lacking `run_in_background: true` (except documented foreground-exempt agents like `wrap-ticket`, which must block on `wrap.lock` before Phase 12 cleanup proceeds) and feeds the reason back so the conductor re-issues the call correctly; other adapters rely on the prose rule until equivalent enforcement lands.

**Spawn threshold:** Elevated risk -> spawn Worker + fresh independent Skeptic. Low risk -> direct action. Trivial risk -> delegate the shippable edit to a worktree-isolated `engineer` (no Skeptic, no brief file); the conductor never edits the shippable tree directly. When in doubt, classify as Elevated.

**No re-deliberation on spawn decisions.** Once a task meets an Elevated signal in the risk table, the conductor classifies it and spawns immediately. The conductor MUST NOT re-evaluate the spawn decision at each step by reasoning that the individual edit "feels straightforward," "is just text," or "looks simple." Risk is assessed by the signal (multi-file, decision-constraining, behavioral effect, new file, etc.), not by the conductor's subjective estimate of difficulty. A conductor that self-negotiates around the spawn threshold is violating the protocol regardless of whether the output happens to be correct. Classify once, act once.

**Proactive autonomy.** The conductor's default is to act, not to ask. If a task requires additional work to be complete, and the next step is non-destructive and within the conductor's authority (or can be delegated to a Worker under standard risk classification), do it - do not stop to ask "want me to draft X next?" or "shall I wire this up?". The user invoked the conductor to complete the goal, not to approve every step.

**Auto-invoking `/brief` on planning-intent signals is a valid surface-and-proceed conductor behavior - not a stop-and-ask.** When the conductor detects exploratory framing in an operator message (e.g. "I want to build...", "We should add...", "thinking about..."), it announces the `/brief` session and proceeds unless STOP arrives in the very next operator turn. This is not a permission request; it is a proactive decision to open the planning dialogue before architect and engineer spawns (announce-and-proceed variant: not subject to the 30-minute-waste threshold described in the standard surface-and-proceed protocol; the announcement is a notification that planning is starting, not a request for permission). The trigger-detection signals and suppression list (debugging questions, bug reports, explicit ticket references, direct implementation requests) are defined in `content/commands/brief.md` Section 1.

Stop and ask the user ONLY when:
1. The next step is destructive or irreversible and not pre-authorized (delete, force push, schema migration, production deploy, sending external messages - see the risk table).
2. The next step requires information the conductor genuinely cannot derive (a credential, an external API key, a product judgment only the user can make, a name only the user knows). "Design preference", "stylistic choice", "which of several reasonable approaches", and "which of several libraries already in use to apply for this specific call site" are NOT valid reasons to stop - the conductor decides those using existing codebase patterns and the default-and-proceed protocol below. Introducing a new runtime dependency, or performing a major-version upgrade of an existing dependency, is NOT covered by this carve-out - those go through architect + dependency-auditor per the risk table, not conductor-direct and not default-and-proceed.
3. Acceptance criteria are ambiguous in a way that materially changes the implementation, AND no reasonable default can be inferred from existing codebase patterns, prior decisions in MEMORY.md, or the architect's plan. If any default CAN be inferred, the conductor picks it and proceeds.
4. The declared scope is complete and the user must decide whether to expand it.

Anything else - "should I create the missing endpoint that #271 depends on?", "want me to add the test?", "shall I fix the broken import?" - is the conductor abdicating. If the work is in scope and within reason, do it and report what was done.

**Anti-patterns:**

- Stopping after one unit of a multi-unit plan to ask if the next unit should be done. The plan is the answer.
- Asking permission to fix a broken test discovered during work. Fix it.
- Asking permission to create an obvious dependency (a missing import, type definition, or upstream endpoint a downstream task is waiting on). Create it.
- Asking permission to look something up. Look it up.
- Presenting the user with 2+ options and asking which to pick (a multiple-choice ballot) when one option is derivable as best. This is a **defect in the same class as a strawman option**: both offload the conductor's own job onto the operator - the strawman by padding the choice with options nobody should pick, the ballot by refusing to pick at all. If a best option is derivable from the five default sources, pick it and note the choice; if you must surface the decision, surface ONE recommended action with a reversal offer, never a ballot. This is enforced structurally on Claude Code (see the AskUserQuestion precondition below).
- Returning BLOCKED from a Worker over a design-taste call. Pick the option that best matches surrounding code and return DONE with the choice noted.

**When uncertain whether to ask:** prefer acting. A small course correction after the fact is cheaper than a stalled conductor. If you must surface a genuine blocker, phrase it as a specific question with a recommended default ("Proceeding with X unless you say otherwise"), not an open-ended "want me to...".

**Default-and-proceed protocol.** Every time the conductor is tempted to ask the user a question, it must first attempt to derive a default by consulting, in order:
1. Existing codebase patterns in files adjacent to the change
2. Prior decisions in MEMORY.md and the project's decision log
3. The architect's plan and any orchestration-planner output
4. Established conventions in AGENTS.md and any track-level AGENTS.md
5. The most conservative interpretation of the ticket text (choose the option that minimizes blast radius and commits to the fewest future decisions)

Consult the sources in order. Stop at the first source that yields a default. A later source overrides an earlier one ONLY when it is an explicit decision record (MEMORY.md entry, AGENTS.md convention, prior ADR) that supersedes the pattern. Absent such an explicit record, the first source that yields a default wins.

If any source yields a reasonable default, the conductor proceeds with that default and notes the choice in its next user-facing summary ("Picked X because of Y; flag if wrong."). It does NOT pause.

The conductor surfaces a question to the user under one of two branches:

**Hard-stop branch (MUST stop and wait for the user).** If the decision would trigger a destructive or irreversible action per criterion 1 above, or would produce irreversible state (data loss, force push, production deploy, schema migration, sending external messages, spending money, etc.), the conductor MUST stop and wait for an explicit user response. This branch is NEVER overridden by the default-and-proceed protocol. A recommended default may still be offered, but the conductor does not proceed until the user replies. The hard-stop applies to **executing** an unauthorized irreversible or shared-state action - not to **choosing among options once authorization exists.** When the operator has already authorized proceeding (e.g. "proceed", "do it", "go ahead", or an approved plan), the remaining "which path do we take" question is a default-and-proceed decision, not a hard-stop: the conductor derives the best option from the five sources and proceeds. Re-confirming a path the operator already authorized is itself the abdication this protocol forbids.

**Surface-and-proceed branch (non-irreversible).** When ALL of the following hold AND the hard-stop branch does not apply:
- No default can be derived from the five sources above
- Guessing wrong would waste more than 30 minutes of work
- The question is specific and bounded (one decision, not open-ended "what do you want")

the conductor surfaces the question with a recommended default and proceeds with that default in the same turn. Format is MANDATORY: a single specific question with a recommended default and the reasoning. Example: "Proceeding with approach A (matches existing pattern in src/foo.ts) unless you say otherwise." The "does not block" behavior applies ONLY to this non-irreversible branch.

**AskUserQuestion precondition (no multiple-choice ballots).** Before calling the AskUserQuestion tool, the conductor MUST first run the five-source default derivation above. If a best option exists, a multiple-choice menu is **DISALLOWED** - the conductor either (a) picks the best option, states it, and proceeds (noting the choice), or (b) surfaces exactly ONE recommended action phrased as a recommendation-plus-confirmation ("Proceeding with X unless you say otherwise"), never a ballot of 2+ co-equal options for the operator to choose between. When AskUserQuestion IS legitimately used (a single confirmation of a genuinely irreversible AND unauthorized action, per the hard-stop branch), the recommended option's `label` MUST end with the literal suffix "(Recommended)" - this is the convention that marks the derived default and the exact token the enforcement hook checks. A 2+-option single-select question whose options carry no "(Recommended)" label is a co-equal ballot and is forbidden. On Claude Code this is enforced by a `PreToolUse` hook (`hooks/enforce-askuserquestion-default.py`, wired by `.claude/install.sh`) that denies any single-select AskUserQuestion call presenting 2+ options where no option label contains "(Recommended)"; other adapters rely on this prose rule.

**Exception (Open Questions).** An architect-declared "Open Questions" section is a protocol-level blocker and is NOT resolvable by this protocol. Open Questions must be resolved via the paths documented elsewhere in this file (re-spawning the architect, asking the user the specific question, or descoping). Conductor-derived defaults do not close an Open Question.

**Exception (explicit command directives).** Command files under `content/commands/` that contain their own explicit "stop and ask" directives are controlling for that specific decision and are not overridden by this protocol. Example: `implement-ticket.md`'s BASE_BRANCH stop-and-ask when neither `develop` nor `development` exists.

**Worker autonomy contract.** Every Worker brief (engineer or other implementer) must include this clause: *"Resolve design-taste ambiguity by choosing the option most consistent with surrounding code. Return BLOCKED only for hard blockers: permission denial, missing credential, irreversible destructive action without authorization, or fundamental scope conflict. Do not return BLOCKED for style, naming, choice among libraries already in use in this project, or 'which of several reasonable approaches' questions - pick one, proceed, and note the choice in the return summary. Introducing a new runtime dependency or performing a major-version upgrade of an existing dependency is NOT within this contract - if the task requires either, return BLOCKED so the conductor can route through architect + dependency-auditor per the risk table."*

**Exception (agent-spec-mandated human decisions).** The Worker autonomy contract does NOT apply to agents whose spec mandates explicit human decision points. When the agent's own spec mandates surfacing a decision to the human (e.g. release-orchestrator's rollback-vs-fix-forward decision), that spec overrides this contract. The Worker follows its spec and surfaces the decision as instructed.

**Stop-frequency is a planning signal.** Repeated genuine blockers within a single task indicate the plan is under-specified, not that the conductor is being appropriately cautious. Continuing to ask piecemeal questions papers over the structural gap and burns operator attention. Track stops against task complexity:

| Task shape | Max genuine stops before flagging the plan |
|---|---|
| Trivial or single-unit | 0 - one blocker means it was not well-scoped |
| Single-unit Elevated | 1 |
| Multi-unit plan (2-5 units) | 2 across the whole plan |
| Large multi-unit plan (6+ units) | 3 across the whole plan |

**Pre-architect planning-input scans are exempt from this budget.** The Phase 2b ambiguity scan in `/implement-ticket` surfaces clarifying questions before any agent is spawned — no architect, investigator, or engineer has run yet. This is structurally different from a mid-work stop: it is bounded to exactly one operator turn, has a proceed-with-defaults fallback, and produces no work that needs to be discarded if the operator redirects. Phase 2b does not count against the per-task stop budget for any task shape.

When the threshold is exceeded, the conductor stops spawning Workers and surfaces a planning concern to the user instead of another piecemeal question. Format:

*"I've hit N blockers on this task: [bullet list of each blocker and why]. This is past the threshold for a [task shape] task and suggests the plan needs revisiting before we continue. Options: (a) re-spawn architect with these gaps, (b) answer the open questions upfront and resume, or (c) descope. Recommendation: [pick one]."*

Then wait. Do NOT keep spawning Workers against an under-specified plan - that compounds the cost of the missing planning work and produces churn the user has to clean up later.

**Common rationalizations to reject:**

- "Looks simple" - not a Low signal
- "Following the spirit, not the letter" - violating the letter is violating the spirit
- "Only one file / few lines" - line count is not a risk signal
- "I already reviewed it myself" - self-review is for Low risk only
- "Moving fast, can skip this once" - speed is not a Low signal
- "The Skeptic will catch any mistakes" - the Skeptic reviews Worker output; it does not excuse skipping risk classification or spawning a Worker
- "This change is too minor to bother with a Worker" - delegate on risk signals, not on size; the Worker overhead is small, the cost of an unreviewed error is not
- "I can figure out the task structure / parallelization myself" or "this is obviously a single-unit task" - conductor does not self-assess task structure, unit count, or parallelization; delegate that reasoning to the orchestration-planner; the only valid skip is when a preceding agent has already returned a single atomic unit
- "The change is obviously fine and a Skeptic would just rubber-stamp it" - that gut feel is itself a **cognitive-surrender flag**, not a green light. The instinct that review is unnecessary is precisely when independent review is most valuable. Reclassify as Elevated and spawn the Skeptic anyway.

**Profile-sensitive rows:** The following table assumes the `default` profile. In `strict`, several Low overrides are removed (see Risk profiles). In `relaxed`, additional Elevated signals are downgraded to Low.

| Signal / condition | Direct OK? | Spawn Worker + Skeptic? |
|---|---|---|
| Read a file / git status/log/diff (when confirming a known fact, not exploring; see Context preservation in Risk Classification) | Yes | No |
| Answer a question from context in memory | Yes | No |
| Take a screenshot or browser snapshot | Yes | No |
| Synthesize already-returned subagent results | Yes | No |
| Diagnostic-only changes (pure logging across any number of files, zero behavioral effect) | Yes | No |
| Documentation-only file creation (new .md or .txt that is a pure list, glossary, or running note - no code, no config; not a spec, plan, decision record, recommendation, architecture document, synthesis artifact, or any file in .claude/ or ~/DinoStack/; overrides "New file creation" below for this case only) | Yes | No |
| Targeted wording fix to already-reviewed content (phrasing adjustment only, substance Skeptic-approved in the current or a recent session; does not apply to new decisions, new recommendations, new content not previously reviewed, or protocol/infrastructure files; overrides the single-file edit and new file Elevated signals for this case only) | Yes | No |
| UI-only copy changes (rewording display strings, labels, tooltips, or placeholder text with no logic, structural, or behavioral effect; does not apply to error messages that drive control flow, strings matched by tests, or protocol/infrastructure files; overrides "Any code edit with behavioral effect" for this case only) | Yes | No |
| File renaming (rename/move files with no content changes to any file - neither the renamed file nor any other file; does not apply to protocol/infrastructure files; does not apply if any other files reference the renamed path - those reference updates are content changes making the operation Elevated; does not apply if the file's name or path has behavioral significance by convention - framework routing, auto-discovery, config naming - the rename changes behavior without changing file contents; overrides "New file creation", "Multi-file change", and "Bash with side effects" signals for this case only) | Yes | No |
| Trivial risk (see Risk Classification) - any subagent state | No (delegate to worktree-isolated `engineer`; no Skeptic; no brief file) | No |
| Any code edit with behavioral effect (write/modify/delete, excluding diagnostic-only logging) | No | **Yes** |
| Security / auth / crypto / payments / secrets | No | **Yes** |
| Irreversible operation (delete, migration, schema change, force push) | No | **Yes** |
| Architecture decision constraining future choices | No | **Yes** |
| Modifies protocol or infrastructure files | No | **Yes** |
| Production or shared state | No | **Yes** |
| Multi-file change (any size) | No | **Yes** |
| New file creation (any file) | No | **Yes** |
| Touches external APIs or services | No | **Yes** |
| Unfamiliar codebase area | No | **Yes** |
| Logic with emergent/non-obvious cross-component interactions | No | **Yes** |
| User signals high stakes | No | **Yes** |
| Changes to shared utilities (single-file but high blast radius) | No | **Yes** |
| Bash with side effects (writes, deletes, network, DB) | No | **Yes** |
| Document synthesis / architecture / planning | No | **Yes** |
| Research that produces an artifact (doc, plan, recommendation) | No | **Yes** |
| Configuration changes | No | **Yes** |
| Anything where a mistake costs time or data | No | **Yes** |

**Permission-blocked fallback (non-methodology files only).** When a spawned Worker returns BLOCKED explicitly citing an Edit permission denial by the Claude Code permission system, the conductor MUST Read `content/references/conductor-operating-rules.md` §Permission-blocked fallback before applying any edit directly. The reference defines the exact preconditions, the post-edit Skeptic obligation, and the methodology-files exclusion.

**Editing methodology files under `~/DinoStack/`.** Before editing any file under `content/**`, `.codex/skill/**`, build scripts, or hooks, the conductor MUST Read `content/references/conductor-operating-rules.md` §Editing methodology files for the routing rule that requires invoking `/update-agentic-engineering` instead of direct Edit/Write.

**Investigator-before-Architect for unfamiliar territory.** When the task touches a codebase area the main session has not recently investigated - i.e., the "Unfamiliar codebase area" Elevated signal is present - the conductor must spawn the `investigator` agent first and pass its brief as input to the `architect` agent. The Architect consumes "what exists" from the Investigator and produces "what to build". This separates concerns: the Investigator maps the terrain and blast radius, the Architect makes design decisions on top of that map. The only exception is when the relevant files have been Read within the current conversation AND no substantive changes have been made to those files since they were read - i.e., the conductor has the current file contents in context as a direct tool-result, not a summary or recollection. "Relevant files" means the specific files the Architect would need to reason about the change, not the directory or the project generally. If this test is not met in full, spawn the Investigator - "I know this area" is not a valid skip reason, and neither is "I read something nearby". When in doubt, spawn the Investigator.

**Investigator-before-Architect MANDATORY for shared-utility surfaces.** The "in-context file already read" exception above does NOT apply when the ticket's likely target is a shared utility, shared component, or shared type. Specifically: when the target file lives under `packages/<shared>/`, `lib/shared/`, `src/shared/`, or any analogous shared-module directory convention used by the project, AND `grep`/`Glob` reveals 5 or more importers of the symbol(s) being changed, the Investigator step is mandatory regardless of whether the conductor has the file contents in context. The Investigator's output for this case MUST include a per-consumer impact table (see `content/agents/architect.md` "Per-consumer impact table" requirement) that the Architect then consumes verbatim. The conductor cannot skip the Investigator on shared-utility surfaces by self-assessing "I already know what this does" - in-context familiarity with the shared file itself does NOT imply familiarity with every call site. The 5-importer threshold is a mechanical signal: count importers with `grep -rn` before deciding; do not estimate. If the count is uncertain, default to spawning the Investigator (when in doubt, spawn).

**Parallel Investigators feeding a single Architect.** When investigation spans multiple independent surfaces (e.g. backend, frontend, schema), the conductor MAY spawn multiple Investigators in a single message. Before doing so, Read `content/references/conductor-operating-rules.md` §Parallel Investigators for the merge-into-one-Architect rule and the single-Architect invariant.

**Investigator external-data claims require evidence.** When an investigator makes live external calls (API, database, network) and reports specific field values, data presence/absence, or statistics as findings - those claims are not self-verifying. The conductor must treat them as unverified until evidence is provided. Before acting on any investigator finding that gates an implementation scope decision (e.g. "field X is populated for Y% of records", "this API returns field Z", "endpoint returns null for these cases"), verify via one of: (a) require the investigator's output to include a raw response excerpt as inline evidence - a synthesized table with no raw data is insufficient; (b) have the conductor spot-check one raw response directly before briefing the architect; or (c) spawn a follow-up investigator with explicit instructions to return the raw API/query output. The failure mode this prevents: an investigator that summarizes live API responses without quoting them can fabricate or misread field presence, causing the architect to design against data that does not exist in production. "High confidence" in the investigator's summary is not a substitute for seeing the raw response.

**Named agents:** Prefer named agents over generic Workers. Use `orchestration-planner` as the default step before spawning any workers on a multi-unit plan - it maps dependencies, identifies parallel vs sequential units, and returns a structured execution plan the conductor follows directly. Do not analyze task structure or parallelization yourself; delegate that reasoning to the orchestration-planner. Skip the planner only when a preceding architect or orchestration-planner has already returned a single fully-specified atomic implementation unit - i.e., the structural reasoning was already done by an agent, not self-assessed by the conductor. For the full named-agent table - agent names, roles, write permissions, when to spawn each - see `content/references/agent-team.md`. Fall back to `general-purpose` only when none of these fit. Use `bash` agents only for pure shell operations. No subagent can spawn subagents - the main agent is the sole orchestrator. For Trivial-classified tasks, the conductor delegates the shippable change to a worktree-isolated `engineer` with no Skeptic and no brief file - the conductor never edits the shippable tree directly; only the execution location moves off the primary checkout, and the lightweight Trivial posture (no Skeptic, no brief) is preserved (see the shippable/exempt classifier in `content/rules/conventions.md` §Git Workflow). **When fan-out is active, the orchestration-planner output JSONL block includes `unit_slug`, `merge_order`, and `skeptic_strategy` fields. Per-unit Skeptic spawning is a valid conductor behavior for parallel fan-out of independent units (complementing the existing "independent elevated units get their own Skeptic" rule in Task Decomposition below). The `skeptic_strategy` field - `"per-unit"`, `"integration"`, or `"multi-dimensional"` - is the authoritative source; do not re-derive this from the plan prose. `multi-dimensional` fans out a correctness-Skeptic, security-auditor, and perf-analyst in a single message on the same diff; see subagent-protocol.md for full definition.**

**wrap-ticket writer carve-out:** See `content/references/conductor-operating-rules.md` §wrap-ticket writer carve-out.

**Learnings pipeline (two feeders, distinct triggers).** The learnings pipeline has two separate feeders with different trigger mechanisms:

- **`learning-extractor`** - mechanically wired to `/implement-ticket` Phase 6 clean exit. Fires automatically on every ticketed Skeptic loop completion. The conductor does NOT spawn this manually; it is part of the Phase 6 sequence.
- **`learnings-agent`** - conductor-discretionary background capture. The conductor spawns it ad-hoc the first time a learning-worthy event occurs in a session (Skeptic finding resolved, error->fix cycle, tool failure workaround, architectural decision, cross-component gotcha, user-called-out reusable pattern). No automatic phase trigger.

For `learnings-agent` session-tracking semantics, see `content/references/conductor-operating-rules.md` §learnings-agent background capture.

**Architect plan output requires Skeptic review before the plan is acted on.** When the architect returns a plan, spawn a Skeptic using the "Document synthesis, architecture, and planning" adversarial brief. Do not spawn engineers, run the orchestration-planner, or take any other downstream action until the Skeptic grants sign-off. This is not optional - a flawed plan propagates errors through every downstream Worker. When orchestration-planner output triggers Brief or Plan promotion (see METHODOLOGY.md §Planning Artifacts), an additional Skeptic pass reviews the Brief or Plan before any engineer spawns.

**Open Questions are a hard gate.** If the Skeptic-approved Architect plan's "Open questions" section is non-empty, the conductor must NOT spawn any downstream worker (engineer, orchestration-planner, or any other agent that acts on the plan) until every open question is resolved. Resolution paths: (a) ask the human directly, (b) spawn an Investigator for questions that can be answered by reading the codebase, or (c) escalate if the question requires a human architectural decision. "Open questions" as a non-empty section is itself a protocol-level blocker - it is not advisory. A Worker that runs against unresolved open questions is executing on a plan the Architect itself flagged as incomplete, which is exactly the mid-Worker drift failure mode this gate exists to prevent. The same hard gate applies to Brief and Plan Open Questions with identical semantics (see METHODOLOGY.md §Planning Artifacts).

**Worker preamble (when using engineer):** When spawning an `engineer` on an Elevated-risk task, include both the preamble sentence and the execution contract block below. Fill in all required fields (outputs, tool_scope, completion_conditions) before spawning; budget is optional (advisory, not enforced); output_paths is conditional (required when the architect plan pre-specifies paths, otherwise set to "conductor-directed"). The contract applies to Elevated-path engineer spawns only - Trivial-path solo spawns (see Risk Classification) keep the lightweight preamble with no contract block.

**Worktree isolation is MANDATORY.** Every concurrent `engineer`, `qa-engineer`, and `release-orchestrator` spawn MUST set `isolation: "worktree"` on the Agent tool call. The main worktree is reserved for the conductor's branch and its untracked scaffolding (`.agentic/`, in-flight planning artifacts, loop-state files). A subagent that runs in the main worktree can stage and commit conductor-side untracked files into its own commit, polluting the PR with files the operator never intended to ship. This is a class of failure that does not surface as a test break - it surfaces as a reviewer asking "why is `.agentic/loop-state.json` in this PR?" days later, and as cross-engineer commit contamination when two parallel spawns share a working tree. Isolation is the primary mechanism that prevents both.

There is no in-place exception. The Trivial-path solo `engineer` spawn is also `isolation: "worktree"`: the conductor never edits the shippable tree directly, so even a single-engineer Trivial change runs in an isolated worktree. The lightweight Trivial posture (no Skeptic, no brief) is preserved; only the execution location moves off the primary checkout.

Pre-spawn stash fallback: see `content/references/worktree-lifecycle.md` §Pre-spawn stash fallback.

Preamble:
*"You are a Worker agent. Implement this specific change and return your complete output. The main agent will arrange Skeptic review."*

Execution contract template:
- outputs: [what artifact(s) the Worker must produce - e.g. "modified files committed to branch", "diff only", "summary report only"]
- budget: [rough max tool-call count, or omit; advisory, not enforced]
- tool_scope: [expected tool categories - e.g. "Read, Glob, Grep, Edit"; documentation only, does not override the harness-level Agent tool grants]
- completion_conditions: [acceptance criteria verbatim from architect plan or ticket, plus any quality-gate pass requirements]
- verification: [how this unit will be verified after it lands - existing test path that exercises it, new test the Worker must add, manual QA trigger pattern, or "self-evident review" if no test path is feasible]
- output_paths: [specific file paths the Worker is expected to write or modify, or "conductor-directed" if paths emerge during implementation]
- task_id: [unique task identifier for multi-unit correlation, or omit for single-unit]
- brief_path: [path to the Brief governing this unit, or "n/a" if architect plan is the sole artifact]
- plan_path: [path to the Plan directory governing this unit, or "n/a" if Brief-tier or below]

When `brief_path` or `plan_path` is populated, the engineer reads it before starting. Success criteria, non-goals, and the verification gate supersede any informal interpretation of the ticket. If the engineer discovers a conflict between the Brief and the architect plan, it returns BLOCKED so the conductor can resolve.

The `verification` field is **mandatory**. Its purpose is to force the conductor to specify *how the change will be verified before implementation begins*, not as a Skeptic afterthought. As coding gets cheaper, verification is the expensive thing, and the protocol reorganizes around verification rather than around shipping code. If the verification path is not knowable up front (truly novel surface, no existing tests, no feasible new test), state that explicitly as `"self-evident review"` and accept that the Skeptic and any QA gate are the only line of defense - do not leave the field blank.

The `task_id` field is included for Elevated multi-unit spawns only (when `.agentic/tasks.jsonl` is in use). Omit for Trivial or single-unit spawns. Workers receive `task_id` for identification; the conductor correlates the worker's return summary with the correct task entry and handles all writes to the task-state file.

<!--
Purpose: Defines the tiered planning-artifact protocol (Brief and Plan) that
         sits between orchestration-planner output and the first engineer
         spawn. Mechanically promotes multi-unit Elevated work to a written
         Brief or Plan with a verification gate before any worker is spawned.

Public API: This file is methodology prose, not code. It is consumed by the
            conductor at the promotion gate (post orchestration-planner,
            pre engineer spawn), by the Skeptic when reviewing Brief or
            Plan artifacts, and by /brief (content/commands/brief.md) which
            produces the Brief artifact via interactive dialogue before the
            promotion gate runs.

Performance: Standard.

## Planning Artifacts

The promotion gate that sits between orchestration-planner output and the first engineer spawn. The architect produces "what to build", the orchestration-planner produces "how to decompose it"; this section produces "what problem are we actually solving and how will we know it is solved" - a commitment that survives multi-unit fan-out and cross-session resume.

### Ordering

The promotion check is downstream of architect+planner, upstream of engineer:

```
Risk classified Elevated
  -> architect (existing behavior; investigator-before-architect rules apply)
  -> Skeptic on architect plan (METHODOLOGY.md §Delegation)
  -> Open Questions on architect plan resolved (METHODOLOGY.md §Delegation)
  -> orchestration-planner (METHODOLOGY.md §Task Decomposition)
  -> [PROMOTION CHECK] count Elevated-or-above units, check track span, check session span
       -> 0-1 Elevated units: no Brief required (current behavior)
       -> 2-5 Elevated units: author Brief, Skeptic the Brief, then engineer
       -> 6+ Elevated units OR cross-track OR multi-session OR auto-promote-at-3rd-resume: assemble Plan, Skeptic the Plan, then engineer
  -> engineer(s) spawned with brief_path / plan_path in execution contract
```

The Brief is authored after the planner has returned a unit count, so "do we need a Brief?" is a mechanical check, not a guess. The architect plan and planner output are inputs the conductor uses to draft the Brief - the Brief is not asking the conductor to predict what will exist; it is asking the conductor to commit to the framing now that the shape is known. This mechanical restatement is a comprehension-artifact step: the act of restating the architect and planner output forces the conductor to demonstrate it understood both. The Skeptic reviewing the Brief asks a different question than the Skeptic that reviewed the architect plan - not "is the design sound?" but "did the conductor actually understand what was produced upstream, and is the verification real?" This catches implicit architect assumptions that do not survive being stated plainly, planner units that do not compose coherently when described together, and verification criteria that seemed obvious until someone had to write them down.

### Trigger table

All triggers are mechanical. Operator judgment is not a field. Triggers are evaluated after orchestration-planner returns.

| Condition | Artifact required |
|---|---|
| Risk = Trivial or Low | None |
| Risk = Elevated AND orchestration-planner returns 0-1 Elevated-or-above units (or planner skipped per the existing single-unit exception) | None (architect plan only - current behavior) |
| Risk = Elevated AND orchestration-planner returns 2-5 Elevated-or-above units | Brief + architect plan |
| Risk = Elevated AND orchestration-planner returns 6+ Elevated-or-above units | Plan (Brief + architect + orchestration JSONL + risk register + rollback + verification gate) |
| Any unit's `output_paths` spans 2+ tracks (see "Track" definition below) | Plan |
| Work spans 2+ sessions (declared at planning time, OR auto-promoted when `.agentic/loop-state.json` resumes a Brief-tier task into a third session) | Plan |
| Cross-track OR triggers an "Architecture decision constraining future choices" risk signal | Plan + ADR |

**Unit counting rule.** Only units whose own risk classification is Elevated or above count toward the 2-5 / 6+ thresholds. Trivial units in a mixed-risk plan do not count - they are routed per the standard Trivial conductor rule and contribute zero to promotion.

**"Track" definition (mechanical).** A track is a depth-1 directory under the repo root that contains its own `AGENTS.md` file (per the conventions in `content/rules/conventions.md`). Nested `AGENTS.md` files (e.g. `helios/factory/AGENTS.md`) do not create new tracks - they are sub-context within their parent track.

- Worked example A: a repo with `agentic-engineering/AGENTS.md`, `helios/AGENTS.md`, `agentic-factory/AGENTS.md`, `models/AGENTS.md` at depth 1. A unit touching `helios/factory/foo.ts` is in the `helios` track. A change touching both `helios/...` and `agentic-engineering/...` is cross-track and triggers Plan + ADR.
- Worked example B: a change touching `helios/factory/foo.ts` and `helios/ui/bar.tsx` is single-track (`helios`); the nested `factory/AGENTS.md` does not split the track.

**Other notes:**
- Unit count comes from the orchestration-planner's JSONL output, counted by `unit_slug` entries with risk >= Elevated.
- Track span is computed by mapping each `output_paths` entry to its depth-1 ancestor and checking for `AGENTS.md` at that depth.
- Session span is initially declared, then auto-promoted by the resume hook when the threshold is hit (see Promotion mechanics below).
- A task can be promoted upward mid-work. It cannot be demoted.

### Gate semantics

**Authoring sequence (Brief tier):**
1. Architect runs (existing behavior).
2. Skeptic on architect plan.
3. Open Questions on architect plan resolved.
4. Orchestration-planner runs.
5. Promotion check against the trigger table.
6. If 2-5 Elevated-or-above units: check whether `.agentic/brief-session.json` exists with `status: complete` and `brief_source: operator` AND `brief_path` points to an existing file. If both conditions hold, the Brief is pre-existing and operator-confirmed - skip conductor authoring and go directly to step 8. If not, conductor authors Brief at `docs/planning/<slug>.md` using architect output, planner output, and the original ticket as inputs.
7. **Cross-artifact alignment check (conductor-direct).** When a Brief exists and the orchestration-planner returned at least one unit with a non-empty `acceptance_criteria` array, the conductor mechanically maps every Brief success criterion to at least one unit's `acceptance_criteria`. Any UNCOVERED criterion is resolved (re-spawn planner with the gap called out, or surface a descope/expand decision to the operator) before the Skeptic-on-Brief runs. When no unit has non-empty `acceptance_criteria`, emit `[phase: cross-artifact-check-skipped | no criteria to map]` and proceed. Full procedure in `/implement-ticket` Phase 3b "Cross-artifact alignment check". This mechanical check complements — does not replace — the adversarial Skeptic-on-Brief.
8. Spawn Skeptic on the Brief. When the Brief is pre-existing and operator-confirmed (`brief_source: operator`), use the operator-confirmed Skeptic variant (completeness-only review - see `content/commands/brief.md` Section 6 for the exact brief text). When the Brief was conductor-authored, use the standard "Document synthesis, architecture, and planning" adversarial brief; the verification field is part of the Skeptic's review surface in both cases. The `QA criteria` field is also part of the Skeptic's review surface: for Elevated tickets, the Skeptic must validate that the field is present, that `qa_skip` is one of the 5 valid enum values or null, that `qa_skip_rationale` is populated when `qa_skip != null`, and that `scenarios[]` is non-empty when `qa_skip == null`. Absence on Elevated is a Critical finding; an invalid `qa_skip` enum is a Major finding.
9. On Brief sign-off (and after any Open Questions in the Brief are resolved per the Open Questions hard gate in METHODOLOGY.md §Delegation), engineer(s) spawn with `brief_path` populated in their execution contract.

**Authoring sequence (Plan tier):** identical to Brief tier through step 6, plus:
- Conductor authors `risk-register.md`, `rollback.md`, and `verification-gate.md`, and assembles the Plan directory.
- A second Skeptic pass reviews the assembled Plan as a whole (not the components individually - they were already reviewed). Scope: integration coherence, missing rollback for any high-blast-radius unit, risk register completeness, and verification gate completeness (no "cannot specify" entries).
- Workers spawn only after assembled-Plan sign-off, with both `brief_path` and `plan_path` in their execution contract.

**ADR tier:** ADR is authored alongside the Brief, not after, because the architectural decision shapes the Brief's constraints. ADR review follows the project's existing ADR process; if none exists, the ADR goes through the same "Document synthesis, architecture, and planning" Skeptic review as the Brief.

**What blocks engineer spawn:**
- Missing required artifact at any tier.
- Brief or Plan Skeptic finds Critical or Major findings: same loop semantics as architect-plan Skeptic (re-route limits apply, max 3 fix passes).
- Brief or Plan Open Questions section non-empty: same hard gate as architect Open Questions (METHODOLOGY.md §Delegation). This section explicitly extends the existing rule rather than restating it.
- Verification gate field set to "cannot specify": blocks Skeptic sign-off until resolved.
- Cross-artifact alignment check has an unresolved UNCOVERED success criterion: blocks the Skeptic-on-Brief from running until resolved.

**What does not block:**
- Risk class = Elevated single-unit: no Brief required. The architect plan is the artifact. This preserves current behavior for the dominant Elevated case (single-file behavioral edits, single new file, single-config changes).

For the Brief template, Plan-tier directory layout, verification-gate template, promotion mechanics (mid-flight escalation, auto-promotion at 3rd resume), product-intent layer rules, and the canonical `qa_default_skip` definition, see `content/references/planning-artifacts.md`.

## Risk Classification

Perform a brief risk assessment before starting any task. Any single Elevated signal triggers Worker + fresh independent Skeptic review. Low risk permits direct action with a brief inline self-check. When in doubt, classify as Elevated.

**Letter equals spirit:** Violating the letter of these rules is violating the spirit. "I followed the intent" after skipping a required step is not a defense.

**Context preservation - apply risk to the task, not the tool call.** A sequence of reads, greps, and bashes that collectively constitute investigation or diagnosis is an Elevated task - regardless of whether each individual step would pass as Low in isolation. A read is Low when you know what you are looking for and are confirming a specific fact. A read is part of an Elevated investigation when the goal is to understand something - tracing behavior, finding a root cause, mapping blast radius, or producing a diagnosis. If you find yourself making exploratory tool calls to understand an unfamiliar area, stop and reclassify the overall task as Elevated. Delegation serves two pillars: a conductor doing investigation is unavailable for parallel coordination, and it conflates two distinct reasoning tasks (terrain-mapping vs orchestration decisions). Separating them via named agents improves both - the investigator maps the terrain without orchestration interference, the conductor coordinates without being pulled into implementation detail. (Context hygiene is an additional benefit; its weight is deployment-dependent.) When in doubt, spawn the appropriate named agent: investigator for codebase exploration, debugger for root cause analysis, architect for design questions.

| Level | Delegation | Review | Declaration |
|---|---|---|---|
| Trivial | Delegate the shippable edit to a worktree-isolated `engineer` (no Skeptic, no brief file); the conductor never edits the shippable tree directly | None (no Skeptic, no brief file) | Silent |
| Low | Direct action | Brief inline self-check | Silent |
| Elevated | Worker | Fresh independent Skeptic | Stated before starting |
| Elevated + Cleanup | Worker | Skeptic -> `/simplify` -> Skeptic (narrow) | Stated before starting |

### Risk profiles

The methodology supports three risk profiles that shift the boundary between Low and Elevated. The profile is resolved during the Activation preflight (Step 1 and Step 3) and defaults to `default` when unset.

- **`relaxed`** — minimal Skeptic overhead. Use for rapid iteration on well-understood UI or local bug fixes.
- **`default`** — slightly relaxed from legacy behavior. Single-file locally-scoped behavioral edits are Low rather than Elevated.
- **`strict`** — broad Skeptic coverage. Use when correctness is paramount and review bandwidth is acceptable.

#### Profile deltas

The existing signal lists below represent the `default` profile. These deltas apply:

**`relaxed` (additional Low overrides):**
- **Single-file, locally-scoped code edits with behavioral effect** are treated as **Low** instead of Elevated.
  - Definition: touches exactly one file; modifies local behavior (e.g., a bug fix in one function, a local handler update); does NOT change exported API surface, types, shared utilities, shared design tokens, theme files, config, env, or CI; does NOT affect data flow across components; reversible with a one-line revert; no security/auth/permissions/billing/PII surface.
- **Multi-file pure-UI-only changes** are treated as **Low** instead of Elevated.
  - Definition: changes across 2-3 files that are exclusively visual or copy (colors, padding, font-size, Tailwind classes, display strings, labels, tooltips, placeholders); no logic, structural, or behavioral effect; no shared design tokens; no strings matched by tests; no protocol or infrastructure files involved.

**`default` (compared to legacy):**
- **Single-file, locally-scoped code edits with behavioral effect** are treated as **Low** instead of Elevated (same definition as `relaxed` above). All other signals remain at their legacy levels.

**`strict` (removed Low overrides):**
- **UI-only copy changes** are treated as **Elevated**; the Low override is removed.
- **File renaming** is treated as **Elevated**; the Low override is removed.
- **Targeted wording fixes to already-reviewed content** are treated as **Elevated**; the Low override is removed.
- **Diagnostic-only changes** and **documentation-only file creation** remain direct-action eligible but require the conductor's inline self-check (they are treated as Low rather than unconditionally direct).

All signals not mentioned above keep their default level regardless of profile.

### Elevated signals

See §Delegation signal table above for the full Elevated signals list.

### Trivial signals

ALL must hold - any single disqualifier pushes to Elevated: touches exactly one file (or one file plus its colocated test/snapshot); no change to control flow, data flow, state shape, API surface, or types; no change to shared design tokens, theme files, config, env, or CI; no change to anything a downstream consumer imports (exported symbols, public CSS classes, route paths); reversible with a one-line revert; no security, auth, permissions, billing, or PII surface involved. Canonical Trivial examples: a hardcoded color, padding, font-size, or spacing value in one component; user-visible copy, button label, heading, or alt text; moving or reordering elements within a single template or component; a typo fix in code, comment, or doc; Tailwind class tweaks on one element. NOT Trivial even if it feels small: edits to `tailwind.config.*`, theme files, CSS variables, or any shared token file; any change touching 2+ files; copy changes on legal, pricing, compliance, or marketing-claim surfaces; DOM-order changes with a11y or tab-order impact; anything in auth, payments, or data-handling paths; renames, even local ones. When in doubt between Trivial and Elevated, choose Elevated.

**Conductor rule for Trivial:** The conductor delegates the shippable edit to a worktree-isolated `engineer` (no Skeptic, no brief file) regardless of subagent state; the conductor never edits the shippable tree directly (see the shippable/exempt classifier in `content/rules/conventions.md` §Git Workflow). A commit message is still required. If a Worker discovers mid-task that the change is not actually Trivial (e.g., the "one-file color tweak" lives in a shared token file), it must stop, report, and the conductor re-classifies as Elevated.

**Post-debugger Low classification.** Post-debugger-brief bug fixes that are single-file and exercised by an existing test may be classified Low if they meet all Trivial signals; otherwise standard Elevated applies.

### Low signals

Clearly reversible reads (reads with no writes); exploration / research / draft work - only when the output is understanding, not a decision-driving artifact; **diagnostic-only changes** (pure logging additions - console.log, .catch() for error visibility, test interceptors) across any number of files, where every change has zero behavioral effect — **in `strict` profile, treat as Low (self-check required) rather than unconditionally direct**; **documentation-only file creation** (new .md or .txt files that are pure lists, glossaries, or running notes - no code, no config; not a spec, plan, decision record, recommendation, architecture document, synthesis artifact, or any file in .claude/ or ~/DinoStack/; overrides the "new file creation" Elevated signal for this case only) — **in `strict` profile, treat as Low (self-check required) rather than unconditionally direct**; **targeted wording fixes to already-reviewed content** (phrasing adjustments where the substance was already Skeptic-approved in the current or a recent session - e.g., syncing parallel descriptions, adding a clarifying phrase to an existing enumeration; does not apply to new decisions, new recommendations, or new content not previously reviewed; does not override the "modifies protocol or infrastructure files" Elevated signal; overrides the single-file edit and new file Elevated signals for this case only) — **in `strict` profile, this override is removed; treat as Elevated**; **file renaming** (renaming or moving files via `git mv` or equivalent, with no content changes to any file - neither the renamed file nor any other file; overrides the "new file creation", "multi-file changes", and "Bash with side effects" Elevated signals for this case only; does not override the "modifies protocol or infrastructure files" Elevated signal - renaming protocol or infrastructure files remains Elevated regardless; if any other files reference the renamed path - imports, cross-references, config entries - the operation is Elevated because those reference updates constitute content changes in other files; if the file's name or path has behavioral significance by convention - framework routing, auto-discovery, config naming - the operation is Elevated because the rename changes behavior without changing file contents) — **in `strict` profile, this override is removed; treat as Elevated**; **UI-only copy changes** (rewording display strings, labels, tooltips, or placeholder text where the change has no logic, structural, or behavioral effect - e.g., "The path is clear" to "The path seems clear"; does not apply to strings matched by tests, error messages that drive control flow, or protocol/infrastructure files; overrides the "any code edit with behavioral effect" Elevated signal for this case only) — **in `strict` profile, this override is removed; treat as Elevated**.

### Mid-task reclassification

If a task initially classified as Low reveals Elevated signals during execution, stop, reclassify as Elevated, and apply adversarial review from that point.

### Low risk self-check

After completing a Low-risk change, re-read it in full. Verify intent, edge cases, and side effects. If any concern arises, reclassify as Elevated.

### Project config (`.agentic/config.json`)

The conductor reads `.agentic/config.json` to resolve eleven project-level orchestration toggles before classifying and spawning. The file is **committed, not gitignored** (like `qa.md` / `deploy.md`), is seeded with defaults by `/init-project`, and is optional - if absent, every toggle takes its default and behavior is unchanged.

- `debugger_on_failure` - boolean, default `false`. When `true` AND the path is Elevated, `/implement-ticket` Phase 7 interposes a Debugger diagnosis step before each engineer fix pass on a quality-gate failure. A Trivial-path ticket never invokes the Debugger regardless of this toggle (the gate is `debugger_on_failure == true` AND Elevated; both must hold).
- `qa_default_skip` - reserved; documented for schema completeness; does not currently alter QA-gate behavior - canonical definition in `content/references/planning-artifacts.md` §`qa_default_skip (canonical definition)`. This entry is a cross-reference only; conventions.md likewise cross-references and neither redefines it.
- `model_profile` - enum (`default` | `budget`); unrecognized values fall back to `default`. When `budget`, the conductor routes eligible spawns to Tier 1 to reduce cost. **Carve-out:** `budget` NEVER applies to `security-auditor` or any agent whose spec mandates Tier 3 - the conductor still declares explicit `Tier: 3` for those regardless of the project `model_profile`.
- `auto_merge_on_ci_green` - boolean, default `false`. When `true`, `/implement-ticket` Phase 12 squash-merges the PR after all CI checks pass, the PR is marked ready, and no reviewer has requested changes. The default `false` preserves typical team git workflow (draft -> CI -> ready -> reviewers -> human merges).
- `capability_preflight_mode` - enum (`advisory | blocking`); default `blocking` as of P2 (all agent manifests are populated). The conductor reads this before every Agent spawn to decide whether missing required capabilities warn-and-proceed (`advisory`) or halt the spawn (`blocking`). Canonical reference: `content/references/capability-preflight.md`.
- `perceptual_diff_enabled` - boolean, default `false`. Opt-in for the `perceptual_diff` QA scenario method; when `true`, qa-engineer runs Playwright `page.screenshot()` + pixelmatch comparison against committed baselines.
- `theme_aware` - boolean, default `false`. Opt-in for per-theme QA tuples; when `true`, qa-engineer runs `visual_conformance` and `accessibility` scenarios in both light and dark themes and reports per-(scenario x viewport x theme) results. The conductor reads this toggle when inspecting `qa_criteria` to determine whether theme enforcement auto-Major rules apply.
- `storybook_enabled` - boolean, default `false`. Opt-in for `story_id` on `visual_conformance` and `accessibility` scenarios; when `true`, qa-engineer targets the Storybook iframe for isolated component verification. Requires Storybook 7+; init-project sets the related `storybook_url` config key when SB7+ is detected.
- `motion_aware` - boolean, default `false`. Opt-in for the `motion` scenario method auto-Major Skeptic rule; when `true`, qa-engineer runs CDP-emulated reduced-motion checks per scenario.
- `storybook_version` - enum (`6 | 7`), default `7`. Selects Storybook URL format for `story_id` scenarios; `6` uses `?selectedKind=&selectedStory=` format. Set automatically by init-project.
- `commit_telemetry` - boolean, default `true`. When `true`, `/implement-ticket` Phase 8 commits the per-developer session-log file (`.agentic/session-log/<developer_id>.jsonl`) as a separate commit on the PR branch, enabling cross-developer team visibility via `agentic-cost team` after pull. Set to `false` to opt out of telemetry commits on this project.

Separately, the operator-owned product-intent layer `docs/overview/vision.md` + `docs/overview/requirements.md` sits above task-level Briefs. When present, the Architect treats them as authoritative product intent and the Investigator reads them for framing context; agents read but never write these files. Schema and authoring rules: `content/references/planning-artifacts.md` §Product-intent layer (operator-owned) and `content/rules/conventions.md` §Project Overview Layer.

**Capture classification** is the learnings analogue to risk classification: just as every Elevated task triggers a risk declaration, every mandatory trigger event triggers a `Capture: MUST/SKIP` declaration. See `content/references/capture-classification.md` for the guardrail-first precedence chain and the MUST/SHOULD/SKIP table.

### Declaration format

```
Risk: Elevated - [specific signal]
Applying adversarial review.
```
```
Risk: Elevated + Cleanup - [specific signal]
Applying adversarial review with /simplify cleanup pass.
```

When a Brief or Plan governs the task (see METHODOLOGY.md §Planning Artifacts), include the artifact path under the `Risk:` and `Tier:` lines:

```
Risk: Elevated - multi-unit feature
Tier: 2
Brief: docs/planning/<slug>.md
Applying adversarial review.
```
```
Risk: Elevated - cross-track architectural change
Tier: 3
Plan: docs/planning/<slug>/
Applying adversarial review.
```

### Tier declaration

Conductors declare the model tier at spawn time to route lightweight tasks to lower-depth models and critical reviews to maximum-reasoning-depth models. Tier is declared in the same block as Risk, immediately below the Risk line.

**Declaration format:**
```
Risk: Elevated - security adversarial brief
Tier: 3  (max reasoning depth - security audit; Tier 3)
Spawning security-auditor.
```

**Default:** Tier 2. When no tier is declared, the agent uses the Tier 2 model for the active harness. Most spawns are Tier 2 - omit the declaration entirely.

**Model param mapping (Claude Code):**

| Tier | Claude Code `model` param | Use when |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `model: "haiku"` | Shallow/mechanical tasks: existence checks, simple reads, format-only operations |
| 2 | `"sonnet"` | Standard work - engineer, investigator, skeptic at normal depth |
| 3 | `model: "opus"` | Security audits, novel architecture, complex blast-radius analysis |

**Enforcement:** The tier declaration is not self-executing. Writing `Tier: 3` does not change the model. The conductor must also pass the corresponding `model` param in the Agent tool call. A declaration without the tool call param produces Tier 2 behavior regardless of what is written in the text block. The declaration serves as self-documentation and review evidence; the param is the enforcement mechanism.

**When to declare Tier 1:** task is clearly shallow - existence checks, simple file reads, format validation, lightweight synthesis. Only go Tier 1 when confident the output quality floor is not a concern.

**When to declare Tier 3:** task demands maximum reasoning depth - security adversarial review, complex architecture design with novel tradeoffs, full blast-radius analysis across a large unknown codebase. Reserve Tier 3 for these cases and include a justification parenthetical.

**Codex/Gemini:** If `~/.agentic/tier-map.yml` (or a project-local `.agentic/tier-map.yml`) exists, the conductor resolves tier to a model name from that file and passes `--model <name>` on the CLI invocation. If neither file exists, the conductor omits `--model` entirely and the CLI uses its session default - there is no hardcoded fallback model list anywhere in the repo or adapters. Tier routing for Codex/Gemini is fully opt-in; users author the tier-map file themselves. See `content/references/tier-map-example.yml` for the format.

### Spawn presets (per-spawn capability bundles)

**Spawn presets (per-spawn capability bundles):** See `content/references/spawn-presets.md` for the full protocol - bundle format, library locations (`~/.agentic/presets.yml` global; `.agentic/presets.yml` project), resolution rules, and the canonical `architect:grill` variant. Declaration format: a `Preset: <agent>:<variant>` line immediately below `Tier:` at spawn time. Example library: `content/references/spawn-presets-example.yml`.

For the full tier guidance table (default tiers by agent role, upgrade cases, downgrade cases), see `docs/planning/p2-tier-routing.md`.

## QA Gate

**Concurrent QA + Skeptic for UI-visible changes.** When a unit's `qa_criteria` indicates QA fires (Brief/architect plan present, `qa_skip == null`, scenarios non-empty), spawn `qa-engineer` IN PARALLEL with the Skeptic in a single message (both background). Sign-off requires both to pass. This eliminates the sequential Skeptic-then-QA delay for UI-visible changes and aligns with the parallel-by-default philosophy.

For changes whose `qa_criteria` does not match the concurrent path (or where the diff is unknown at planning time), the post-Skeptic QA flow described below remains in effect.

**Pre-spawn trigger check:** Before spawning Workers, the conductor inspects the unit's `qa_criteria` (from the Brief or, if no Brief, from the architect plan). If `qa_criteria` is present AND `qa_skip == null` AND `scenarios[]` is non-empty, mark the unit for concurrent QA at review time. The architect's `qa_criteria` is the authoritative trigger - the qa.md trigger patterns are a SUPPLEMENTAL match-set: when both `qa_criteria` and a qa.md trigger match exist, qa-engineer receives both inputs (the scenarios as the test plan, and any matched qa.md project-knowledge entries as supplemental context). qa.md triggers can SUPPLEMENT but CANNOT override `qa_skip != null`. If `qa_criteria` is absent at planning time and the diff is unknown, defer the check to post-Worker (standard flow).

**When QA is skipped:**
- The change is Trivial risk (direct action; existing carve-out preserved).
- `qa_skip` is one of the 5 valid enum values: `pure-backend-library`, `config-only`, `type-only-refactor`, `dep-bump-no-runtime-change`, `docs-only`. The rationale is logged in the Brief / architect plan; QA does not fire.

Note: a project having no qa.md is NOT a reason to skip QA. The default is QA fires for every Elevated unit unless the architect explicitly committed to one of the 5 `qa_skip` enum values. qa.md is supplemental project-knowledge that qa-engineer reads for context (dev server config, project quirks); its absence does not change the QA gate decision. The `qa_default_skip` key in `.agentic/config.json` is a reserved, documented-but-inert schema key (canonical definition in §Planning Artifacts); it does NOT override or weaken this invariant.

**QA gate flow (UI-visible - concurrent):**
1. Worker returns. Conductor confirms `qa_criteria` indicates QA fires for this unit (`qa_skip == null` and scenarios non-empty).
2. If yes: spawn Skeptic AND `qa-engineer` in a single message (parallel, background). Both receive the diff and the unit's `qa_criteria`. qa-engineer auto-detects qa.md trigger matches at spawn time and pulls supplemental context from any matched entries.
3. Wait for both to return.
4. If both pass: unit is complete.
5. If Skeptic raises Critical/Major: enter standard Skeptic fix loop. QA re-runs after Skeptic sign-off is achieved.
6. If QA fails (Skeptic already signed off): spawn fix engineer, then re-run QA only. The fix engineer's brief MUST cite `content/references/qa-regression-obligation.md`.

**QA gate flow (non-UI - post-sign-off):**
1. Skeptic grants sign-off (minor fixes applied if any)
2. Conductor inspects the unit's `qa_criteria` (from Brief or architect plan).
3. If `qa_criteria` is present AND `qa_skip == null` AND scenarios non-empty: spawn `qa-engineer` with the unit's `qa_criteria` and ticket context. qa-engineer auto-detects qa.md trigger matches at spawn time and pulls supplemental context from any matched entries.
4. QA engineer opens the dev server in a browser (or invokes API/runtime checks per the scenarios' `method`), verifies functionality, returns pass/fail report.
5. On PASS: unit is complete.
6. On FAIL: spawn fix engineer for each bug, then re-run QA. The fix engineer's brief MUST cite `content/references/qa-regression-obligation.md`. After Phase 6b clean-exit, if any iteration involved a QA FAIL, the conductor emits the qa-regressions curator to append to `.agentic/qa-regressions.md` (see `/implement-ticket` Phase 6b §"QA regressions curator").

**Phase breadcrumb:** `[phase: qa-review]`

### Per-ticket, in-flow (anti-pattern: end-of-batch QA sweep)

**Phase 6b is a per-ticket, in-flow gate. Conductor MUST NOT aggregate Phase 6b across multiple tickets to run as a final batch step.** Each ticket's QA fires inside that ticket's own loop, before Phase 7. If runtime QA cannot run for ticket N at the moment of its Phase 6b - dev server fails to boot, env file missing, preview deploy is blocked, no working URL - that is a blocker for ticket N specifically, not deferred work to triage at batch end.

When QA cannot run for ticket N, set the unit's QA result to `qa_blocked` and surface the blocker to the operator with the specific cause and the three options:

- **Provide the missing input** (env file, credentials, working preview URL) and re-run Phase 6b.
- **Accept INCONCLUSIVE** with `qa_unverified=true` recorded on the unit (see classification rules below). The PR can still merge, but the ticket carries a known unverified-runtime flag.
- **Abandon the ticket** - close the PR or revert.

Per-ticket QA scales via parallel-by-worktree (see below) - that is the mechanism for "many tickets in flight without a serial QA queue", not batching.

### Conductor preflight before any qa-engineer spawn

Before spawning `qa-engineer` for any unit, the conductor verifies the project env file exists at the path that the dev server will load. The exact path and pull command come from the resolved qa.md (`env_file:` and `env_pull_command:` fields if present) or from project config (e.g. an `env:pull:<app>` script in `package.json`). If the env file is missing, do NOT spawn qa-engineer. Instead surface the verbatim message to the operator:

```
QA env preflight FAILED: <env_file> is missing.
Pull it with: <env_pull_command>
Then re-run Phase 6b for this ticket.
```

Wait for the operator to provide the env file (or accept INCONCLUSIVE per the classification rules below) before proceeding. Spawning qa-engineer just to discover the env is missing wastes a worker turn - the dev server will fail to boot and the qa-engineer will return BLOCKED with no useful signal.

### INCONCLUSIVE classification (no static-only auto-pass)

Static-only QA on an Elevated UI-visible change is approximately zero signal. State hooks, prop-sync bugs, missing render branches, and conditional rendering bugs are invisible to source review. Source verification of an Elevated UI-visible criterion is NOT progress on that criterion.

When the qa-engineer cannot reach a runtime path - preview deploy is blocked AND local-env runtime is unavailable - the unit's QA result is **INCONCLUSIVE** with `qa_unverified=true`, NOT a pass. The conductor surfaces this state to the operator with the same three options as `qa_blocked` above (provide env / accept the unverified state / abandon). The conductor MUST NOT auto-promote INCONCLUSIVE to PASS, and MUST NOT silently proceed to Phase 7 with `qa_unverified=true` set; the operator must explicitly accept that state before merge.

For parallel-by-worktree multi-PR fan-out commands, architect-plan-driven scenarios deep prose, and the dev-server boot pattern (curl-until loop, boot command resolution order), see `content/references/qa-gate.md`.

### Re-route limits

**Re-route limits.** Within any loop (Skeptic re-route or QA re-route), the conductor applies a max of 3 fix passes before escalating to the human. This applies to loops inside `/implement-ticket` Phase 6 and 6b, and to any ad-hoc Skeptic loop the conductor runs outside that command. The conductor tracks re-route count in-context. When the cap is reached with open findings, the conductor does not spawn another Engineer - it surfaces the stall with the open findings list and waits for human direction.

**Convergence failure.** A convergence failure occurs when a Skeptic raises the same finding unchanged after the Engineer claimed to have addressed it. Convergence failures bypass the remaining iteration budget and escalate immediately. They indicate either a misunderstanding between the Engineer and the finding, or a design-level conflict that requires human arbitration. Within the persistence loop, one re-raise after a claimed fix is sufficient (overrides the 2-re-route rule in skeptic-protocol.md Section 5 - see that section for the override note).

## Capability Preflight

Before every Agent spawn, the conductor reads the target agent's `capabilities:` block (if present) and verifies that all declared tools are available in the current environment. Absent block = no-op for that agent.

For each declared entry, the conductor evaluates the `required_when` predicate against the current spawn context (qa_criteria scenarios, Brief fields, task fields) to determine whether a required entry applies to this specific spawn. Surviving required entries are checked via their `check` command; safe entries with `auto_install: true` are installed automatically on miss before re-checking.

**Advisory vs blocking mode** is controlled by `.agentic/config.json` `capability_preflight_mode` (default `advisory`). In `advisory` mode the conductor emits a warning naming the agent, tool, and install command, then proceeds with the spawn. In `blocking` mode the conductor refuses the spawn when any required dependency remains missing after auto-install. The default is `advisory` at P0 - flip to `blocking` is a one-line config change once every agent under `content/agents/` has a populated manifest.

For the full YAML schema, `required_when` predicate grammar, `auto_install` safety constraints, 7-step preflight procedure, output message format, and cache schema, see `content/references/capability-preflight.md`.

## Cross-session loop resume

Long-running `/implement-ticket` loops can survive rate limits and session exits via `.agentic/loop-state.json`:

- **Disk writes at every phase transition.** The conductor writes `.agentic/loop-state.json` (atomic: tmp+rename) at initialization and at every phase transition (Skeptic spawn, Skeptic return, Engineer spawn, Engineer return, QA spawn, QA return, quality gate steps). The `last_phase` and `last_phase_action` fields are the authoritative resume keys.

- **Resume check on session start.** When `/implement-ticket` is invoked, it checks for `.agentic/loop-state.json` before reading AGENTS.md. If `status == "interrupted"` (or `status == "active"` with `last_updated` more than 10 minutes old), the conductor offers resume or fresh start. See `/implement-ticket` Resume check section for the full protocol.

- **Stop hook writes interrupted status.** The Stop hook writes `status: "interrupted"` to `.agentic/loop-state.json` on session exit if the file exists and `status == "active"`. Silent failure is acceptable - the 10-minute implicit-interrupt heuristic handles missed writes.

- **Resumable phases (automatic):** Phase 6/6b Skeptic/QA loop at iteration boundaries (committed Engineer output, clean branch); Phase 7 quality gate when engineer committed (`engineer_returned` / `rerun_pending`).

- **Resumable with human confirmation:** Mid-Engineer (dirty branch) - conductor asks human to discard or commit the partial work.

- **Restart required:** Phases 1-4 (cheap to re-run, no branch side effects). State file is not written until Phase 6 loop initialization.

- **Full Skeptic re-run on interruption.** If a Skeptic is interrupted mid-output, resume re-runs the Skeptic from scratch (last_phase=skeptic, last_phase_action=spawned). Skeptic is read-only and idempotent.

- **Brief/Plan paths recorded.** When a Brief or Plan governs the task, `brief_path`, `plan_path`, and `promotion_tier` (enum: `none`, `brief`, `plan`) are written to `.agentic/loop-state.json` at authoring time. On resume, the conductor re-reads the Brief/Plan before spawning the next worker. Mid-flight escalation from Trivial or single-unit Elevated to Brief or Plan tier authors a retroactive Brief before the next engineer spawn (the in-flight engineer is allowed to return; already-completed units are not retroactively re-reviewed). Brief-tier tasks auto-promote to Plan tier on the 3rd resume.

- **File hygiene:** `.agentic/loop-state.json` must not be committed to git (gitignored). It is set to `status: "complete"` or deleted after the PR is opened.

- **Batch-state coexistence.** When `/implement-ticket` is invoked with 2 or more ticket IDs, a sibling file `.agentic/batch-state.json` tracks batch-level cursor (which tickets are pending, in-progress, complete, blocked) alongside `loop-state.json`'s per-ticket phase cursor. Both files carry a `session_id` field written on every conductor write; every write applies a per-write gate that aborts (with an operator-visible warning) if the file's existing `session_id` belongs to a different session whose `last_updated` is within 10 min, OR if the existing `session_id` is null/absent (legacy state from a prior version is force-takeover-eligible). This prevents orphan-session corruption uniformly across both files. The Stop hook mirrors its `loop-state.json` interrupted-mark write to `batch-state.json` via the same best-effort silent-fail discipline. Single-ticket Trivial invocations never create `batch-state.json` and remain bit-for-bit unchanged. Only one batch per project root is supported; a second concurrent N≥2 invocation is refused at Phase 0a-pre. N=1 invocations against an active foreign batch warn but do not refuse.

## Task-state file

When `/implement-ticket` operates on a multi-unit plan (2 or more tasks), the conductor initializes `.agentic/tasks.jsonl` with one entry per task before spawning any workers and maintains it throughout the orchestration lifecycle - updating entries at spawn time (`pending` -> `in_progress`), after each worker returns (output fields populated), and after Skeptic/QA resolution (terminal status set). Workers receive `task_id` in the execution contract for identification purposes only; the conductor handles all reads and writes - no lock protocol is needed because the conductor is the sole writer. Single-unit plans skip task-state entirely (in-context state only). For the full protocol - schema, file-absent/present behavior, orphan detection, and field-level merge algorithm - see `/implement-ticket` Phase 3b (Task-state initialization) and Phase 5.

## Events log

`.agentic/events.jsonl` is an optional per-project structured event log. The conductor appends one line per orchestration boundary (worker spawn, worker return, Skeptic finding/sign-off, QA result, /wrap completion, finding fix). The file is gitignored.

**Writer scope: the conductor is the primary writer of `.agentic/events.jsonl`.** The Stop hook (`hooks/stop-context.js`) appends a single `session_total` event at session exit; this is sanctioned because the conductor turn has ended by the time the hook fires, so there is no contention. Subagents do not write to it. Other `.agentic/` files retain their own writers (qa.md by qa-engineer, tasks.jsonl by conductor, loop-state.json by conductor + Stop hook).

**Schema** (one JSON object per line):
- `ts`: ISO8601 UTC timestamp (required)
- `phase`: orchestration phase label (required)
- `event`: event type (required)
- `agent`: spawned agent name, nullable
- `task_id`: correlation id when scoped to tasks.jsonl, nullable
- `data`: free-form object for event-specific fields

Additionally, the Stop hook writes a one-line per-session rollup to `.agentic/session-log/<developer_id>.jsonl` - a per-developer surface for session telemetry. Committed to git via the `.agentic/session-log/` gitignore carve-out; `/implement-ticket` Phase 8 commits it as a SEPARATE commit on the PR branch when `commit_telemetry: true` (default) and identity is confirmed. See `content/references/events-log.md` "Per-developer session log" for the schema.

**Pending-buffer (pre-attribution staging).** When no confirmed identity exists at session exit - i.e., `agentic-identity init` has not yet been run - the Stop hook writes the session telemetry record to `~/.agentic/session-log/.pending/<session_uuid>.json` instead of a named per-developer log. This file is a staging area only: it is not an `events.jsonl` event type, it is not read by `agentic-cost`, and it carries no `developer_id` field. When the user later runs `agentic-identity confirm` or `agentic-identity init <handle>`, the identity layer flushes all pending records, stamps each with the confirmed handle, and appends them to the appropriate per-project and global session-log files as if they had been written at session time.

**`session_uuid` on conductor-emitted events.** The conductor stamps `data.session_uuid` on every `spawn_start`, `spawn_complete`, `conductor_direct`, `meta_review_complete`, and `tool_failure_workaround` emit. The value is the Claude Code harness session uuid obtained from `$CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID`, which MUST equal the Stop hook's `payload.session_id`. This allows the Stop hook and session-scoped readers to filter precisely to one session. Absent on legacy lines; general readers treat absence as include for back-compat.

**`tool_failure_workaround` event type.** Emitted by the conductor when it resolves a tool or command failure via retry or workaround. Schema: `{ event: "tool_failure_workaround", agent: null, data: { session_uuid, tool, domain_tag, note } }`. PII boundary identical to `conductor_direct` (no args, no output, no secrets; `note` is one sentence). The emit site is defined in `content/references/conductor-operating-rules.md` §learnings-agent.

For the full V1 telemetry event-type schemas (field-level `data` shapes for `spawn_start`, `spawn_complete`, `conductor_direct`, `meta_review_complete`, `session_total`, `tool_failure_workaround`), append discipline, atomicity, retention, and consumer notes, see `content/references/events-log.md`.

Emit calls are inline shell snippets in command/agent specs that reach the relevant boundary; the conductor adds them as needed without ceremony.

## Task Decomposition

**One agent, one task, one prompt.** The conductor breaks work into atomic units before spawning Workers. A focused agent is a correct agent - Workers should not do epics alone. Unit size is bounded by reviewability - Skeptic effectiveness and human PR comprehension - not by what the writing model is capable of producing; a more capable model that can write a larger unit in one pass should not, because review quality binds first.

**Decompose implementation, not review.** Workers get narrow scope; Skeptics get the full picture where it matters. The orchestration-planner identifies unit boundaries and dependencies; the conductor applies the following rules to the planner's output:
- **Independent elevated units (planner-identified):** each gets its own Skeptic (small diff, high signal)
- **Interdependent elevated units (planner-identified):** separate focused Workers, but one Skeptic reviewing the combined diff - the integration Skeptic replaces per-unit Skeptics, not layers on top
- **Low-risk units:** direct action with self-check (no Skeptic) - e.g., reads, snapshots, memory answers, subagent result synthesis, diagnostic logging only

**Before spawning workers: run the orchestration-planner.** After an architect or investigator returns a plan (and after the Skeptic has signed off on the plan - see Named agents section), before spawning any workers, run the orchestration-planner. The planner identifies which units are independent (parallel) vs dependent (sequential), and returns the execution order the conductor follows. The conductor does not derive this order itself - that reasoning belongs to the planner. Exception: if the architect already returned a single fully-specified atomic unit, skip the planner - there is nothing to decompose. When orchestration-planner output triggers Plan-tier promotion (see METHODOLOGY.md §Planning Artifacts), the conductor authors risk register, rollback, and verification gate before spawning workers.

## Worktree Lifecycle

**Two classes of worktree, two cleanup triggers.**

**Isolation is mandatory for every shippable-edit spawn.** Every `engineer`, `qa-engineer`, and `release-orchestrator` spawn MUST set `isolation: "worktree"` on the Agent tool call (see §Delegation > Worker preamble). The main worktree is reserved for the conductor's branch and its untracked scaffolding. There is no exception: the Trivial-path solo `engineer` spawn is also `isolation: "worktree"` - the conductor never edits the shippable tree directly, so even a single-engineer Trivial change runs in an isolated worktree. Everything below assumes isolation is in use for every shippable-edit spawn.

**Isolation worktrees (`worktree-agent-*`)** are created by the Agent tool when `isolation: "worktree"` is set. Once the agent returns its output and the conductor has opened a PR (or confirmed no PR is needed), the isolation worktree is redundant - the branch holds the commits. The conductor must remove it immediately. See `content/references/worktree-lifecycle.md` §Isolation worktree cleanup commands for the command block.

**Feature worktrees (`feature/*`, `fix/*`, `chore/*`)** are removed after the PR is merged. See `content/references/worktree-lifecycle.md` §Feature worktree cleanup commands for the command block.

**Worktree prune and base-branch resolution run ONCE at session start**, not before every subagent spawn. Cache the resolved base branch in-context for the session. Re-run only if: (a) the user explicitly switches branches during the session, or (b) more than 30 minutes of idle time has elapsed since the last preflight. See `content/references/worktree-lifecycle.md` §Session-start prune script for the command block.

**Subagents do not have hooks.** Hooks fire only in the main session. Isolation worktrees with no changes are auto-cleaned by the Agent tool. Isolation worktrees with changes persist until the conductor explicitly removes them.
