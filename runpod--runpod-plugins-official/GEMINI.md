# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to AI agents when working with code in this repository.

## Overview

This is a **plugin marketplace** for AI agents (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini,
opencode, Cursor, Copilot, etc.) to work with Runpod. It contains no application
code — only a plugin whose skills (`SKILL.md`) plus supporting reference docs teach
agents how to manage GPU workloads across several backends and how Runpod works
conceptually.

Two install paths read the **same** `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`:
- **Plugin:** `/plugin marketplace add runpod/runpod-plugins-official` then `/plugin install runpod@runpod`
  (native, auto-updating; in Claude Code also wires the hosted MCP via
  `plugins/runpod/.mcp.json` — Codex/Gemini may need it added separately).
- **skills.sh:** `npx skills add runpod/runpod-plugins-official` (skills.sh reads the marketplace
  manifest and installs the declared skill paths).

## Repository layout

```
.claude-plugin/marketplace.json   Claude Code / skills.sh manifest (plugin + skills paths)
.agents/plugins/marketplace.json  Codex manifest
plugins/runpod/                   THE plugin
  .claude-plugin/plugin.json      Claude Code plugin manifest
  .codex-plugin/plugin.json       Codex plugin manifest
  gemini-extension.json           Gemini manifest
  .mcp.json                       hosted Runpod MCP server config
  README.md  CHANGELOG.md

  golden-paths/                   worked end-to-end reference tasks (no SKILL.md)
hooks/                            validate_marketplace / check_versions / check_runpod_branding / check_links
.github/workflows/validate.yml    runs the hooks on PRs
```

## Architecture: a router + lanes

The plugin's skills are organized as one **entrypoint** that routes to specialized
**lanes**. `skills/runpod/` is the router: an agent reads it first when the right
lane is unclear, then follows its decision table into a lane's `SKILL.md`.

```
skills/runpod/            router / entrypoint — decides the lane
skills/runpod-mcp/        manage infra via the Runpod MCP server (structured tool calls)
skills/runpodctl/         manage infra via the CLI (+ Hub, file transfer, SSH, doctor)
skills/flash/             write & deploy your own code on Runpod serverless (@remote)
skills/companion-clis/    prerequisite CLIs (hf, gh, docker, aws)
skills/runpod-usage/      conceptual knowledge ("how Runpod works") — not a tool
  reference/*.md          detailed topics, loaded on demand
```

**runpod-mcp and runpodctl overlap** — both drive the same Runpod REST API for the
same infra CRUD. Which one wins is decided by the **capability-first, environment-second**
precedence rule, canonical in `skills/runpod/SKILL.md`'s capability matrix (roughly: runpod-mcp
for simple structured CRUD when connected, runpodctl the moment an op needs a capability MCP
lacks — Hub, `send`/`receive`, SSH, `doctor`, models, pod-from-template / CPU / multi-GPU — or
whenever the agent is shell-only). Consult the matrix there; don't rely on this summary.

## Skill file format

`SKILL.md` files use YAML frontmatter:
- `name`, `description` — skill identity. The `description` is the **routing surface**
  (always in the agent's context).
- `allowed-tools` — tool permissions (e.g., `Bash(runpodctl:*)`).
- `user-invocable` — set for skills a user invokes directly.
- `compatibility`, `metadata` (author, version), `license`.

The body is markdown the agent consumes, following **progressive disclosure** (see Contributor
rule 8): the `SKILL.md` body stays small and long tables / deep explanations live in
`reference/*.md` that the body links to and the agent opens only when needed.

## Golden paths & evals

- `golden-paths/` holds worked end-to-end reference tasks + a gap analysis each.
  They have **no `SKILL.md`**, so skills.sh never loads them as skills — they are
  acceptance scenarios/documentation. Each path's live-verification status is
  authoritative in `golden-paths/README.md`'s Status column (and restated in each
  file) — read it there.
- Each golden-path doc uses one section template: Goal · Status · Lane(s) → When to
  use → Prerequisites → Walkthrough → Verify → Gotchas → Cost & cleanup → skill gaps.
- Each skill's `evals/*.eval.md` are regression scenarios (Prompt / Expected
  behavior / Assertions).

## Contributor rules

Facts and context live in the sections above; these are the binding must-dos when
editing the repo. Each is its own checkable rule.

1. **Adding a skill** — list its path in the `skills` array of
   `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` (that array is what skills.sh resolves).
2. **Skill `description`** —
   - Keep each `description` to 1–2 sentences.
   - If a skill overlaps another, its `description` names the sibling and states when to defer to it.
3. **`allowed-tools`** — omit this field for knowledge-only skills.
4. **Capability matrix** — the runpod-mcp vs runpodctl precedence rule is canonical
   in `skills/runpod/SKILL.md`.
   - When it changes, update `skills/runpod/SKILL.md`, `skills/runpod-mcp/SKILL.md`, and
     `skills/runpodctl/SKILL.md` in the same change.
   - State the rule only in `skills/runpod/SKILL.md`; do not restate it elsewhere.
5. **Golden paths** —
   - Single approach → one file `NN-name.md`. Multiple variants → a folder
     `NN-name/` with a `README.md` (goal, "which variant?", shared schema/gotchas/cost)
     plus one `variant-*.md` per approach.
   - Every golden-path doc follows the section template listed under *Golden paths & evals*.
   - When adding or splitting a path, update the `golden-paths/README.md` table in the
     same change.
   - The per-path verification status is authoritative in `golden-paths/README.md`'s Status
     column; do not restate it in AGENTS.md (it drifts).
6. **Evals** — add or update an `evals/*.eval.md` when you add or change routing/behavior.
7. **Releases** —
   - Never hand-bump versions; release-please cuts the release (see `CONTRIBUTING.md` →
     Cutting a release).
   - Use Conventional Commits.
8. **Skill body size** — put only a decision table plus the 80% patterns in a `SKILL.md` body;
   move long tables and deep explanations into `reference/*.md` linked from the body.

## Conventions

Rules:
- **Spelling:** write "Runpod" (capital R); the CLI command is `runpodctl` (lowercase).

Reference facts (not rules):
- **Auth:** everything unifies on `RUNPOD_API_KEY`; the hosted MCP is the exception
  (OAuth "Sign in with Runpod"). Companion CLIs use their own creds.
- **License:** Apache-2.0.
