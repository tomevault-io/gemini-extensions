# CLAUDE.md - AI Agent Guidelines

This document provides essential guidelines for AI agents working on this codebase.

## Critical Context

**This code controls heating for real homes.** Mistakes can result in:
- Pipes freezing and bursting (costly property damage)
- Excessive energy bills
- Uncomfortable living conditions
- Hardware damage to valves and boilers

**Quality and correctness are paramount.** When in doubt, ask questions rather than make assumptions.

## Environment Setup

**ALWAYS run before any code quality checks:**

```bash
uv sync --dev
```

This installs all dependencies including dev extras (pytest, ruff, ty).

## Pre-Commit Checklist

**BEFORE committing any changes, run ALL of these checks in order:**

```bash
# 1. Run tests first - ensures code works correctly
uv run pytest

# 2. Format code with ruff (auto-fixes formatting issues)
uv run ruff format .

# 3. Lint with ruff (auto-fixes what it can)
uv run ruff check . --fix

# 4. Type check with ty
uv run ty check
```

**All checks must pass before committing.** CI will reject PRs that fail any of these.

## Pre-PR Checklist

**BEFORE creating a pull request, validate that your changes have 100% test coverage:**

```bash
# 1. Generate coverage XML report
uv run pytest --cov=custom_components/ufh_controller --cov-branch --cov-report=xml

# 2. Check diff coverage against main branch (100% required)
uv run diff-cover coverage.xml --compare-branch=main --fail-under=100
```

**If diff coverage fails:**
1. Review the output to see which specific lines lack coverage
2. Add tests for the uncovered lines
3. Re-run the diff coverage check until it passes

**Why this matters:** Codecov enforces diff coverage on PRs. Validating locally prevents wasted reviewer time on PRs that will fail CI.

## Documentation Synchronization

**The `docs/` directory is the source of truth for design decisions.** See `docs/index.md` for the full documentation structure.

When making changes:
1. Check if your changes align with the documentation
2. If changes conflict with the docs, update BOTH the code AND relevant doc files
3. Never leave the documentation out of sync with the implementation
4. Document any new features, entities, or configuration options in the appropriate doc file

## Testing Requirements

### Test Coverage
- **Overall**: 90% minimum (enforced in pyproject.toml and CI)
- **Core Modules**: 100% target, 98% minimum acceptable (critical control logic)

### Bug Fixes: Reproduce First
When fixing bugs:
1. **Write a failing test case first** that reproduces the bug
2. Verify the test fails as expected
3. Implement the fix
4. Verify the test now passes
5. Add any additional edge case tests

This ensures bugs don't regress and documents the expected behavior.

### New Features: Test Thoroughly
- Write tests for all new functionality
- Cover edge cases (null values, boundary conditions, error states)
- Test integration with Home Assistant entities where applicable

### Test Fixtures
Common fixtures are in `tests/conftest.py`:
- `mock_config_entry` - Config entry with one zone
- `mock_config_entry_no_zones` - Config entry without zones
- `mock_config_entry_multiple_zones` - Config entry with two zones
- `mock_config_entry_with_heat_request` - Config entry with heat request entity
- `mock_config_entry_all_entities` - Config entry with all controller-level entities
- `mock_config_entry_with_supply_temp` - Config entry with supply temp entity
- `mock_temp_sensor` - Sets up mock temperature sensor and valve states
- `mock_recorder` - Mocked Home Assistant recorder

Helper functions (not fixtures, call directly in tests):
- `setup_zone_pid()` - Set up zone temperature and update PID
- `setup_zone_historical()` - Set up zone historical data for flow/window blocking

### Test Organization

Tests are organized into four directories based on their scope and dependencies:

**`tests/unit/`** - Pure logic tests
- Testing a single class/function in isolation
- No Home Assistant dependencies (no `hass` fixture)
- Examples: PID controller math, observation window calculations

**`tests/integration/`** - Entity platform tests
- Testing entity platforms (climate, sensor, binary_sensor, etc.)
- Testing component interaction with mocked Home Assistant state
- Requires `hass` fixture and mock entities
- Examples: climate entity behavior, controller orchestration, zone evaluation

**`tests/scenarios/`** - End-to-end workflow tests
- Testing realistic user workflows from start to finish
- Testing resilience (failures, recovery, state persistence)
- Multi-step operations over time (coordinator updates)
- Examples: state persistence across restarts, database failure recovery

**`tests/config/`** - Configuration and setup tests
- Testing config flows (UI configuration)
- Testing setup/unload lifecycle
- Testing conditional entity creation based on config
- Examples: config flow validation, entry setup/unload

## Code Quality Standards

### Ruff Configuration
- Line length: 88 characters
- Target: Python 3.13+
- Select: ALL rules (with specific ignores, see pyproject.toml)
- Tests have relaxed rules for asserts, magic values, etc.

### Type Annotations
- Use type hints for all function signatures
- Use TypedDict for structured dictionaries (see const.py)
- Run `uv run ty check` to verify

### Constants
- Extract magic numbers to `const.py`
- Use typed defaults (TimingDefaults, PIDDefaults, SetpointDefaults, PresetDefaults)
- Document units in comments (seconds, percentages, ratios)

## Git Commit Practices

### Good Commit History
- **Each meaningful change deserves its own commit**
- Prefer new incremental commits over amending
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Use conventional format: `Fix X`, `Add Y`, `Update Z`
- PRs are squash-merged, so we can have detailed commit history during development


## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### 1. Forgetting `uv sync`
```bash
# WRONG - tools not installed
uv run pytest  # Error: pytest not found

# RIGHT
uv sync --dev
uv run pytest
```

### 2. Committing Without Full Check Cycle
```bash
# WRONG - only ran tests
uv run pytest
git commit

# RIGHT - full verification
uv run pytest && uv run ruff format . && uv run ruff check . --fix && uv run ty check
git commit
```

### 3. Not Updating Documentation
```python
# WRONG - Added new entity without documenting
# (creates silent drift between docs and code)

# RIGHT - Update docs/entities.md with new entity details
```

### 4. Fixing Bugs Without Tests
```python
# WRONG - Just fix the code
def calculate_duty_cycle(...):
    return fixed_value  # "trust me it works now"

# RIGHT - Write failing test first
def test_duty_cycle_edge_case():
    # This test should fail before the fix
    assert calculate_duty_cycle(edge_case) == expected
```

### 5. Floating-Point Equality in Tests
Use `pytest.approx()` for asserting float values that have passed through
any computation (division, interpolation, averaging). Direct assign-and-read
without computation can use `==`. Dictionary comparisons with nested floats
are especially dangerous — assert float fields individually with `approx()`.

### 6. Running Commands with Paths Outside the Working Directory
Do not use `git -C`, `find /`, or similar flags that reference paths outside the
current working directory. They are unnecessary and cause permission check failures.
Prefer relative paths from the project root and avoid changing working directories
when possible.

## CI Workflows

The CI runs three workflow files on PRs:

1. **checks.yml** - Unit tests with pytest
2. **lint.yml** - Ruff check, Ruff format, ty type check
3. **validate.yml** - Hassfest and HACS validation

All must pass for PR approval.

## Quick Reference Commands

```bash
# Setup environment
uv sync --dev

# Run tests
uv run pytest

# Run tests with coverage
uv run pytest --cov=custom_components/ufh_controller --cov-branch

# Format code
uv run ruff format .

# Lint and auto-fix
uv run ruff check . --fix

# Type check
uv run ty check

# Full pre-commit check
uv run pytest && uv run ruff format . && uv run ruff check . --fix && uv run ty check

# Check diff coverage (before creating PR)
uv run pytest --cov=custom_components/ufh_controller --cov-branch --cov-report=xml && uv run diff-cover coverage.xml --compare-branch=main --fail-under=100

# Bump version (updates pyproject.toml and manifest.json)
uv run bump-my-version bump patch  # 0.1.3 → 0.1.4
uv run bump-my-version bump minor  # 0.1.3 → 0.2.0
uv run bump-my-version bump major  # 0.1.3 → 1.0.0
```

## Domain Knowledge

### PID Control
- Proportional-Integral-Derivative controller for temperature regulation
- Output is duty cycle (0-100%) representing heating demand
- Integral term has anti-windup protection

### Observation Period
- 2-hour windows aligned to midnight by default (00:00, 02:00, 04:00...)
- Zones get quota based on duty cycle average
- Prevents rapid valve cycling

### Safety Features
- Window/door detection blocks heating (prevents energy waste)
- Minimum run time prevents valve wear
- DHW (hot water) priority for system coordination

### EMA Filtering
- Temperature readings are smoothed via Exponential Moving Average filter
- Configurable time constant (tau); tau=0 disables filtering

### Heating Curve
- Outdoor temperature compensation via two-point linear interpolation
- Adjusts supply target temperature based on outdoor conditions

### Hysteresis Rounding
- Temperature display uses hysteresis to prevent flicker
- Raw value must cross boundary by 0.03°C before display changes

### Home Assistant Integration
- Uses ConfigEntry with subentries for zones
- DataUpdateCoordinator for state management
- Recorder queries for historical state averages
