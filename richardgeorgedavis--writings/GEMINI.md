# Copilot instructions for Richard George Davis — writings repo

Purpose: provide concise, actionable guidance for future Copilot/Codex sessions working in this repository.

1) Build, test, and lint commands

- Install: npm install
- Dev server: npm run dev
- Production build: npm run build
- Serve production locally: npm run start
- Serve local reference mirror: npm run serve:ref
- Lint: npm run lint
- Typecheck: npm run typecheck
- Verify (pre-release check: typecheck + lint + build): npm run verify
- Snapshot freshness check: npm run check:snapshots
- Snapshot/content sync: npm run sync:data (legacy alias: sync:cache)
- Rebuild static client search assets: npm run sync:static-assets
- Re-extract local ref manifest: npm run sync:ref-manifest

Focused tests use Node's built-in test runner through `tsx --test`, for example `npx tsx --test lib/production-env.test.ts lib/discussions.test.ts`. Access-specific coverage is available through `npm run test:commerce-access`.

2) High-level architecture (big picture)

- Framework: Next.js (next v16) + React (v19) TypeScript-based app. Styling uses Tailwind/PostCSS.
- Content model: snapshot-driven. Live sources (Google Sheet for Poems/Stories and Substack RSS for Articles) are fetched by operator-only sync scripts and written to data/writing.cache.json. Runtime pages read from that snapshot, keeping the app static-first.
- Routing: canonical site routes include /, /category/[slug], /article/[slug], /resources, /docs, /docs/[slug], /docs/template-components, /docs/template-components/[origin], /docs/template-components/[origin]/[source], and /legal/[slug]. Legacy compatibility routes remain.
- Operations: sync scripts (scripts/*.ts) populate the cache. POST /api/sync and POST /api/revalidate are available but protected by secrets. Reader responses and discussions are SQLite-backed writable state; discussion comments require Turnstile plus magic-link verification before public display.
- Build & release: production builds use the committed snapshot (data/writing.cache.json). A static export is an allowed release option but the pipeline expects snapshot semantics.

3) Key conventions and repo-specific patterns

- Snapshot-first: do not rely on live fetches at runtime. Any content-change workflow should update the snapshot (sync:data) and commit the resulting data/writing.cache.json for it to be live.
- Source truth mapping:
  - Poems tab in the Google Sheet -> Poems
  - Stories tab in the Google Sheet -> Stories
  - Substack RSS -> Articles (enriched at snapshot time)
- Scripts namespace: commands with sync:* manage source sync, cache, and static assets. Respect these scripts for content operations rather than ad-hoc fetches.
- Secrets/environment contract: env vars used by ops:
  - GOOGLE_SHEETS_SOURCE_URL (only for live sync)
  - SUBSTACK_FEED_URL (optional)
  - SITE_URL (used for canonical URLs; set for production)
  - SYNC_SECRET and REVALIDATE_SECRET (protect POST endpoints)
  - READER_RESPONSE_SECRET
  - READER_RESPONSES_DB_PATH and DISCUSSIONS_DB_PATH (writable SQLite paths)
  - NEXT_PUBLIC_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY and TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY (discussion spam gate)
  - SMTP_* vars (discussion magic-link delivery, and later access-email delivery)

- Ref-first rule: the repo contains local reference shells in ref/. AGENT.md instructs to treat helio-1k2.pages.dev and ref/usegately.com as the live visual reference. Align shell and layout to those references.

- AGENT.md workflow rules (important for AI/automation):
  - AGENT.md is a repo-specific briefing file for humans and agent operators in this repository. Do not assume GitHub Copilot automatically includes AGENT.md in its prompt; open it explicitly when you need the fuller workflow and batch-order guidance.
  - When following AGENT.md in Codex or other agentic sessions, produce a Pre-Run Brief before making code changes. The brief must include model recommendation, task classification, dependency-ordered batch plan, assumptions, stop conditions, and desired run mode (RUN SAFE / RUN FULL / RUN UI FIRST / RUN CONTENT FIRST).
  - If you are working in a GitHub Copilot context that only auto-applies repository custom instructions, treat AGENT.md and HANDOVER.md as additional repo guidance to inspect, not as guaranteed auto-loaded instructions.

4) Where to look first (docs and handover)

- In GitHub Copilot, this `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file is the repository-wide custom instruction file that is auto-applied when supported. For deeper repo context, then open AGENT.md, README.md, docs/ (docs/README.md, docs/spec/*, docs/brief/*), and HANDOVER.md.

5) AI-assistant / other tooling configs

- Repository-wide GitHub Copilot custom instructions live in this file: `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.
- No `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md` path-specific Copilot instruction files were found.
- No CLAUDE.md, AIDER_CONVENTIONS.md, .cursorrules, or .windsurfrules files were found in the repo root.
- AGENT.md exists as additional repo guidance, but it is not the documented GitHub Copilot repository custom-instructions filename. Open it explicitly when you need the repo’s deeper batch workflow and operating rules.
- Avoid conflicting guidance across Copilot personal instructions, repository instructions, organization instructions, and repo docs. If instructions conflict, Copilot behavior is not guaranteed to follow this file exactly.

6) Quick troubleshooting pointers

- If content appears stale locally, run `npm run check:snapshots`, then `npm run sync:data -- --dry-run` or `npm run sync:commerce -- --dry-run` before rewriting committed cache files.
- If type errors block build, run npm run typecheck to surface incremental TypeScript problems.
- To inspect local reference rendering, run: npm run serve:ref and browse the served ref site.

Environment

- Reference .env.example at the project root for environment variable templates.
- Required/important vars for operations and production: SITE_URL, SYNC_SECRET, REVALIDATE_SECRET, NEXT_PUBLIC_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY, TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY, and SMTP_* for discussion magic links.
- Optional/operator-only vars: GOOGLE_SHEETS_SOURCE_URL (only for live sync), SUBSTACK_FEED_URL, READER_RESPONSE_SECRET, READER_RESPONSES_DB_PATH, DISCUSSIONS_DB_PATH, DISCUSSION_EMAIL_HASH_SALT, and DISCUSSION_IP_HASH_SALT.

Snapshot file

- Canonical snapshot path: data/writing.cache.json. Production builds read the committed snapshot at this exact path. Check freshness with `npm run check:snapshots`; update it by running `npm run sync:data` and committing the result only when the dry-run/check output is acceptable.

AGENT.md & Pre-Run Brief (template)

- AGENT.md is the authoritative agent-facing guide. Follow its Pre-Run Brief requirement before making code changes.
- Example one-paragraph Pre-Run Brief (copy and adapt):

  "Pre-Run Brief — Model: gpt-5.4 (medium reasoning). Task: Run a content sync and regenerate static assets. Dependency-ordered plan: (1) npm run sync:data, (2) npm run sync:static-assets, (3) npm run verify. Assumptions: SITE_URL and SYNC_SECRET are set locally. Stop conditions: any TypeScript errors or lint failures. Run mode: RUN CONTENT FIRST."

CI workflows

- CI definitions live under .github/workflows. Inspect those workflow files to understand automated checks and deployment steps.

Tests

- There is no top-level `npm test` script yet. Run focused tests with `npx tsx --test path/to/file.test.ts`; common suites include `lib/production-env.test.ts`, `lib/discussions.test.ts`, `lib/reader-responses.test.ts`, and `npm run test:commerce-access`.

Per-folder notes (recommended)

- app/
  - Next.js app directory (app/). Routes, layouts, and page-level components live here. Prefer server components for data-heavy pages and client components only where interactivity is required. Check app/layout.tsx and next.config.ts for global settings and middleware.
  - Data access: pages read from data/writing.cache.json (snapshot-first). Avoid introducing runtime fetches from live sources unless explicitly for operator-only sync flows.
  - Styling: Tailwind-style utility classes are used across components, with PostCSS configured in postcss.config.mjs. There is currently no root tailwind.config.* file, so prefer checking app/globals.css, component class usage, and PostCSS/Tailwind package setup before assuming a separate Tailwind config exists.

- components/
  - Reusable UI components and template fragments. Keep components presentational and typed (TypeScript). Follow existing prop patterns and Tailwind utility usage. Refer to docs/template-components for conventions and generated manifest usage.
  - Prefer composition over global state; components are consumed by app/ routes and pages.

- scripts/
  - Content and tooling scripts (scripts/*.ts and a few python helpers). Run TypeScript scripts via the "tsx" runner (e.g., npm run sync:cache). Important scripts include sync-cache.ts, build-static-search-index.ts, and extract-ref-manifest.ts which update data/writing.cache.json or generated assets.
  - serve-ref-no-cache.py is a Python helper to serve the ref/ mirror (use python3 to run it).
  - When editing scripts, preserve snapshot semantics and respect env vars (GOOGLE_SHEETS_SOURCE_URL, SYNC_SECRET).

- data/
  - Contains committed snapshot files such as data/writing.cache.json and data/commerce.cache.json. Runtime SQLite files for reader responses, discussions, and deferred access state are writable production data and must not be synced through git or normal deploys.

If you want this file expanded further (per-file examples, command snippets per folder, or linting/style rules for components), say which area to expand and it will be added.
