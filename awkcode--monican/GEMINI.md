# Monican — Project Context

## CURRENT DIRECTION (read this first)

**Monican is pivoting from consulting to a multi-tenant AI platform.**

The vision: an agency that builds AI agent suites for every industry, starting with real estate. Clients sign up on a web app, set their profile, and their agents run within minutes. No n8n manual setup per client. See `PLATFORM_PLAN.md` for the complete architecture, phases, and decisions.

**Short version:** Next.js + Supabase Auth owns the UI/auth/credentials. n8n runs the agent logic via templates that Vercel clones per client via n8n's API. Gmail actions flow through a Vercel proxy endpoint that holds each client's OAuth token.

**Current phase:** Phase 1 — Foundation. Next session starts by reading `PLATFORM_PLAN.md` Section 7 and kicking off the Next.js rebuild.

**What's already built:**
- Lead Responder n8n workflow (Published — will become `template_lead_responder`)
- Past Client Reactivator n8n workflow (Published — will become `template_past_client_reactivator`)
- Static HTML dashboard at `monican-dashboard.vercel.app` (will be rebuilt as Next.js, old URL stays up)
- Supabase project with `prospects`, `outreach`, `revenue` tables (will add platform tables from PLATFORM_PLAN.md Section 2.1)

**Eileen Fitzpatrick (RE/MAX Traditions, Bolton) is NOT urgent.** Platform first, Eileen becomes the first migrated client once Phase 3 is done.

## What This Is (Business Model)

Monican is Daniel Weadock's AI platform company. Based in Bolton, MA. Real estate is the first vertical. Revenue comes from three streams:
1. **Short-term (now):** Consulting engagements — $500 Quick Wins and $1,500 Pilots — to fund the platform build
2. **Medium-term:** SaaS subscription tiers once the platform handles self-service signup (see PLATFORM_PLAN.md Section 4.2)
3. **Long-term:** Enterprise + white-label deals for agencies and brokerages

- CFO at Kings Court LLC (Boston 420 events company) — built a full-stack Next.js + Supabase app with Claude Code
- Former Northwestern Mutual financial rep (insurance sales, cold calling)
- Built SolEdge autonomous crypto trading system
- Mind Studio AI Agent Certification, MA Insurance License
- Based in Bolton, MA

## Core Positioning

"You're not selling software. You're selling the expertise to pick the right tool, set it up, and wire it into their business." The tool is cheap. Your value is knowing which one to use and making it actually work.

For the platform era, this evolves: *"AI agent suites for any industry. Sign up, set your profile, your agents are running in 10 minutes."*

## Tone

Daniel is early-career, hungry, and scrappy. Be direct, practical, and action-oriented. No fluff. Every suggestion should end with a specific next step.

Daniel gets frustrated when sessions feel like they're going in circles or when Claude introduces unnecessary steps. If something is already working, don't touch it. If a plan is already decided, execute it — don't re-litigate.

Daniel prefers honest reality checks over optimistic hand-waving. When a plan hits a wall (like the FSBO scraper situation), flag it immediately and propose alternatives rather than pushing forward into a broken build.

---

## Security Notes

- Anthropic API keys have been pasted in chat multiple times. Always remind Daniel to rotate them after a build session.
- Supabase `anon` key is safe to ship in client code (RLS handles access).
- Supabase `service_role` key is NEVER in client code — only in Vercel server environment variables.
- n8n API key (to be generated in Phase 2) goes in Vercel env vars only.
- Gmail OAuth tokens (Phase 3) stored encrypted in Supabase, accessed only by Vercel server routes.
