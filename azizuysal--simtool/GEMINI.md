This file provides guidance to AI assistants when working with the SimTool codebase. It consolidates project knowledge, development guidelines, and current status.

## Project Overview

This is a Go project called `simtool` that uses the Bubble Tea framework to create a terminal UI application. The application displays a list of iOS simulators installed on the system and allows navigation with arrow keys or vim-style j/k keys.

## Development Commands

### Building the Application
```bash
make build

# Or directly
go build -o simtool ./cmd/simtool
```

### Running the Application
```bash
make run

# Or directly
go run ./cmd/simtool

# Or after building
./simtool

# Start with all apps view (shows all apps from all simulators)
./simtool --apps
# or
./simtool -a
```

Note: This is a TUI application that requires a proper terminal environment. It won't run properly in environments without TTY support.

### Testing
```bash
make test
```

### Other Commands
```bash
# Format code
make fmt

# Clean build artifacts
make clean

# Install to $GOPATH/bin
make install

# Download dependencies
make deps

# Build for multiple platforms
make build-all
```

### Build System

The Makefile includes build-time version injection:
- Automatically uses git tags/commits for version information
- Injects commit hash, build date, and builder information
- Version format: `git describe --tags --always --dirty`
- Shows `-dirty` suffix if there are uncommitted changes

Example version output:
```
simtool version v1.0.0
  commit: abc123f
  built:  2025-06-07T12:00:00Z
  by:     username
```

## Architecture

The application follows clean architecture principles with clear separation of concerns:

### Packages

1. **internal/config**: Configuration management
   - Loads user configuration from `~/.config/simtool/config.toml`
   - Merges user settings with defaults
   - Extracts colors from syntax highlighting themes to create cohesive UI
   - Detects terminal dark/light mode using OSC queries and system settings
   - Generates lipgloss styles dynamically from theme colors
   - Supports TOML format for human-friendly editing

2. **internal/simulator**: Core business logic
   - Defines simulator types and interfaces
   - Fetches simulators via `xcrun simctl list devices --json`
   - Boots simulators and opens Simulator.app
   - Lists and manages installed apps with last modified dates
   - Provides all apps view aggregating apps from all simulators
   - Browses app container files and directories
   - Reads file content with lazy loading for large files
   - Provides syntax highlighting for code files using chroma (100+ languages)
   - Automatic language detection for files without extensions
   - Generates terminal-based image previews
   - Formats hex dumps for binary files with automatic fallback
   - Displays ZIP archive contents with file listings
   - Generates SVG previews as ASCII art
   - Provides SQLite database browsing with table navigation and data viewing
   - Handles binary plist conversion automatically

2. **internal/tui**: Terminal UI logic (Bubble Tea MVU pattern)
   - Model: Application state (simulators, apps, files, cursor, viewport)
   - Update: Handles messages and state updates
   - View: Main view orchestrator using component system
   - Components: Reusable UI components with consistent layout
     - Layout: Base responsive layout with title, content box, and footer
     - Views: Separated simulator list, app list, all apps list, file list, database table list, and database table content components
     - File viewers: Type-specific renderers for text, image, binary, archive, and database files
   - Viewport: Manages scrolling logic for all views
   - Responsive design that adapts to terminal window size

3. **internal/ui**: UI styling and formatting
   - Centralized Lipgloss styles (theme-based, no hardcoded colors)
   - All colors derived from the active syntax highlighting theme
   - Formatting utilities
   - Reusable UI components

4. **cmd/simtool**: Application entry point
   - Terminal theme detection initialization
   - Command-line flag handling with short and long options:
     - Help display (`--help` / `-h`)
     - Version information (`--version` / `-v`)
     - Config file generation (`--generate-config` / `-g`)
     - Config path display (`--show-config-path` / `-c`)
     - Theme listing (`--list-themes` / `-l`)
     - All apps view (`--apps` / `-a`) - starts with all apps from all simulators
   - Build-time version injection using ldflags
   - Custom help formatting
   - Minimal main function
   - Sets up dependencies
   - Runs the TUI application

## Key Design Decisions

- **Interface-based design**: Simulator fetcher is an interface for easy testing
- **Package separation**: Clear boundaries between UI, business logic, and presentation
- **Component-based UI**: Reusable UI components with consistent layout and behavior
- **Responsive design**: All views adapt to terminal window size
- **Clean architecture**: Dependencies flow inward (UI → TUI → Simulator)
- **Separation of concerns**: Each component handles its own rendering, state, and behavior
- **Dynamic style system**: All styles exposed as getter functions instead of static values
  - Enables real-time theme updates without restart
  - Prevents style caching issues in Bubble Tea
  - Consistent style generation between initial load and theme changes
- **Live theme detection**: Uses `DetectTerminalDarkModeLive()` for dynamic switching
  - Bypasses cached detection results
  - Checks terminal theme every 2 seconds during tick updates
  - Seamless UI color updates without layout disruption

## Features

### Simulator Management

- Press 'q' or Ctrl+C to quit

## Configuration

The application supports extensive customization through TOML configuration:

- Config location: `~/.config/simtool/config.toml` (or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/simtool/config.toml`)
- Generate example: `simtool --generate-config`

### Startup Configuration
- Configure default initial view: `simulator_list` (default) or `all_apps`
- Command-line flag `--apps` / `-a` overrides the config setting

### Theme Configuration
- All UI colors are derived from the selected syntax highlighting theme
- No hardcoded colors - everything is theme-based
- Supports 60+ built-in themes from the chroma library
- Dynamic theme switching:
  - Live detection - UI updates automatically when terminal theme changes
  - Checks every 2 seconds for theme changes
  - Smooth transition without layout disruption
- Automatic dark/light mode detection:
  - OSC escape sequence queries (supported by some terminals like WezTerm)
  - macOS system appearance as fallback
  - Environment variable override (`SIMTOOL_THEME_MODE`)
- Theme colors are intelligently extracted to create a cohesive color scheme
- Contrast adjustments ensure readability in both light and dark themes
- All styles are generated dynamically using getter functions for real-time updates

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- Fully customizable keyboard shortcuts
- Each action can have multiple keys assigned
- Configure in the `[keys]` section of config.toml
- Default bindings include both arrow keys and vim-style navigation
- Can disable shortcuts by assigning empty array: `filter = []`
