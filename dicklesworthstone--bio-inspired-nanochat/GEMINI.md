## RULE 0 - THE FUNDAMENTAL OVERRIDE PREROGATIVE

If I tell you to do something, even if it goes against what follows below, YOU MUST LISTEN TO ME. I AM IN CHARGE, NOT YOU.

---

## RULE NUMBER 1: NO FILE DELETION

**YOU ARE NEVER ALLOWED TO DELETE A FILE WITHOUT EXPRESS PERMISSION.** Even a new file that you yourself created, such as a test code file. You have a horrible track record of deleting critically important files or otherwise throwing away tons of expensive work. As a result, you have permanently lost any and all rights to determine that a file or folder should be deleted.

**YOU MUST ALWAYS ASK AND RECEIVE CLEAR, WRITTEN PERMISSION BEFORE EVER DELETING A FILE OR FOLDER OF ANY KIND.**

---

## Irreversible Git & Filesystem Actions — DO NOT EVER BREAK GLASS

1. **Absolutely forbidden commands:** `git reset --hard`, `git clean -fd`, `rm -rf`, or any command that can delete or overwrite code/data must never be run unless the user explicitly provides the exact command and states, in the same message, that they understand and want the irreversible consequences.
2. **No guessing:** If there is any uncertainty about what a command might delete or overwrite, stop immediately and ask the user for specific approval. "I think it's safe" is never acceptable.
3. **Safer alternatives first:** When cleanup or rollbacks are needed, request permission to use non-destructive options (`git status`, `git diff`, `git stash`, copying to backups) before ever considering a destructive command.
4. **Mandatory explicit plan:** Even after explicit user authorization, restate the command verbatim, list exactly what will be affected, and wait for a confirmation that your understanding is correct. Only then may you execute it—if anything remains ambiguous, refuse and escalate.
5. **Document the confirmation:** When running any approved destructive command, record (in the session notes / final response) the exact user text that authorized it, the command actually run, and the execution time. If that record is absent, the operation did not happen.

---

### Python Toolchain

- Use **uv** for everything Python.
  - ❌ Never use `pip`, `pip install`, or `pip freeze`.
  - Lockfiles: only `uv.lock`. Do not introduce any other lockfile.
- Target **Python 3.14** only. No need to support older Python versions.
- Use **pyproject.toml** exclusively for project configuration. Never create `requirements.txt`.
- Virtual environment is managed by uv (`.venv/`).

Run scripts via:
```bash
uv run python -m scripts.base_train
uv run python -m pytest tests/
```

Add dependencies:
```bash
uv add <package>
```

---

### Environment Configuration

We load all configuration from the existing `.env` file. We NEVER use `os.getenv()` or `dotenv` directly. Use **python-decouple** in this exact pattern:

```python
from decouple import Config as DecoupleConfig, RepositoryEnv

# Initialize decouple config (project-local .env; must not be overwritten)
decouple_config = DecoupleConfig(RepositoryEnv(".env"))

# Configuration
SOME_VAR = decouple_config("SOME_VAR", default="default_value")
```

The `.env` file exists but may not be visible to you. **NEVER overwrite it**.

---

### Code Quality Checks

**CRITICAL:** After any substantive code changes, you MUST verify no type or lint errors were introduced:

```bash
# Lint check (auto-fix where safe)
uv run ruff check --fix

# Type check
uv run ty check
```

If errors appear, carefully understand and fix each one. Read sufficient context to understand the RIGHT way to fix them, not just silence them.

---

### Code Editing Discipline

- Do **not** run scripts that bulk-modify code (codemods, invented one-off scripts, giant `sed`/regex refactors).
- Large mechanical changes: break into smaller, explicit edits and review diffs.
- Subtle/complex changes: edit by hand, file-by-file, with careful reasoning.

---

### Backwards Compatibility & File Sprawl

We optimize for a clean architecture now, not backwards compatibility.

- No "compat shims" or "v2" file clones.
- When changing behavior, migrate callers and remove old code **inside the same file**.
- New files are only for genuinely new domains that don't fit existing modules.
- The bar for adding files is very high.

---

### Logging & Console Output

- Use the **rich** library for all console output (informative, detailed, colorful).
- Prefer structured logging via Python's `logging` module over raw `print()`.
- No random print statements in library code; if needed, make them dev-only and clean them up.
- Log structured context: IDs, step numbers, metrics, etc.
- If a logger helper exists (e.g., in `common.py`), you must use it; do not invent a different pattern.

---

### Third-Party Libraries

When unsure of an API, look up current docs (late-2025) rather than guessing.

Key libraries in this project:
- **PyTorch** (torch) - Neural network framework
- **Triton** - GPU kernel compilation
- **maturin/PyO3** - Rust extensions (rustbpe tokenizer)
- **rich** - Console output
- **wandb** - Experiment tracking
- **tensorboard** - Training visualization

## MCP Agent Mail — Multi-Agent Coordination

Agent Mail is already available as an MCP server; do not treat it as a CLI you must shell out to. MCP Agent Mail *should* be available to you as an MCP server; if it's not, then flag to the user. They might need to start Agent Mail using the `am` alias or by running `cd "<directory_where_they_installed_agent_mail>/mcp_agent_mail" && bash scripts/run_server_with_token.sh` if the alias isn't available or isn't working.

What Agent Mail gives:

- Identities, inbox/outbox, searchable threads.
- Advisory file reservations (leases) to avoid agents clobbering each other.
- Persistent artifacts in git (human-auditable).

Core patterns:

1. **Same repo**
   - Register identity:
     - `ensure_project` then `register_agent` with the repo's absolute path as `project_key`.
   - Reserve files before editing:
     - `file_reservation_paths(project_key, agent_name, ["bio_inspired_nanochat/**"], ttl_seconds=3600, exclusive=true)`.
   - Communicate:
     - `send_message(..., thread_id="FEAT-123")`.
     - `fetch_inbox`, then `acknowledge_message`.
   - Fast reads:
     - `resource://inbox/{Agent}?project=<abs-path>&limit=20`.
     - `resource://thread/{id}?project=<abs-path>&include_bodies=true`.
   - Optional:
     - Set `AGENT_NAME` so the pre-commit guard can block conflicting commits.
     - `WORKTREES_ENABLED=1` and `AGENT_MAIL_GUARD_MODE=warn` during trials.
     - Check hooks with `mcp-agent-mail guard status .` and identity with `mcp-agent-mail mail status .`.

2. **Multiple repos in one product**
   - Option A: Same `project_key` for all; use specific reservations (`frontend/**`, `backend/**`).
   - Option B: Different projects linked via:
     - `macro_contact_handshake` or `request_contact` / `respond_contact`.
     - Use a shared `thread_id` (e.g., ticket key) for cross-repo threads.

Macros vs granular:

- Prefer macros when speed is more important than fine-grained control:
  - `macro_start_session`, `macro_prepare_thread`, `macro_file_reservation_cycle`, `macro_contact_handshake`.
- Use granular tools when you need explicit behavior.

Product bus:

- Create/ensure product: `mcp-agent-mail products ensure MyProduct --name "My Product"`.
- Link repo: `mcp-agent-mail products link MyProduct .`.
- Inspect: `mcp-agent-mail products status MyProduct`.
- Search: `mcp-agent-mail products search MyProduct "bio_inspired_nanochat-123 OR \"release plan\"" --limit 50`.
- Product inbox: `mcp-agent-mail products inbox MyProduct YourAgent --limit 50 --urgent-only --include-bodies`.
- Summaries: `mcp-agent-mail products summarize-thread MyProduct "bio_inspired_nanochat-123" --per-thread-limit 100 --no-llm`.

Server-side tools (for orchestrators) include:

- `ensure_product(product_key|name)`
- `products_link(product_key, project_key)`
- `resource://product/{key}`
- `search_messages_product(product_key, query, limit=20)`

Common pitfalls:

- "from_agent not registered" → call `register_agent` with correct `project_key`.
- `FILE_RESERVATION_CONFLICT` → adjust patterns, wait for expiry, or use non-exclusive reservation.
- Auth issues with JWT+JWKS → bearer token with `kid` matching server JWKS; static bearer only when JWT disabled.

## Beads (br) — Dependency-Aware Issue Tracking

Beads provides a lightweight, dependency-aware issue database and CLI (`br` - beads_rust) for selecting "ready work," setting priorities, and tracking status. It complements MCP Agent Mail's messaging and file reservations.

**Important:** `br` is non-invasive—it NEVER runs git commands automatically. You must manually commit changes after `br sync --flush-only`.

### Conventions

- **Single source of truth:** Beads for task status/priority/dependencies; Agent Mail for conversation and audit
- **Shared identifiers:** Use Beads issue ID (e.g., `br-123`) as Mail `thread_id` and prefix subjects with `[br-123]`
- **Reservations:** When starting a task, call `file_reservation_paths()` with the issue ID in `reason`

### Typical Agent Flow

1. **Pick ready work (Beads):**
   ```bash
   br ready --json  # Choose highest priority, no blockers
   ```

2. **Reserve edit surface (Mail):**
   ```
   file_reservation_paths(project_key, agent_name, ["src/**"], ttl_seconds=3600, exclusive=true, reason="br-123")
   ```

3. **Announce start (Mail):**
   ```
   send_message(..., thread_id="br-123", subject="[br-123] Start: <title>", ack_required=true)
   ```

4. **Work and update:** Reply in-thread with progress

5. **Complete and release:**
   ```bash
   br close 123 --reason "Completed"
   br sync --flush-only  # Export to JSONL (no git operations)
   ```
   ```
   release_file_reservations(project_key, agent_name, paths=["src/**"])
   ```
   Final Mail reply: `[br-123] Completed` with summary

### Mapping Cheat Sheet

| Concept | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Mail `thread_id` | `br-###` |
| Mail subject | `[br-###] ...` |
| File reservation `reason` | `br-###` |
| Commit messages | Include `br-###` for traceability |

## bv — Graph-Aware Triage Engine

bv is a graph-aware triage engine for Beads projects (`.beads/beads.jsonl`). It computes PageRank, betweenness, critical path, cycles, HITS, eigenvector, and k-core metrics deterministically.

**Scope boundary:** bv handles *what to work on* (triage, priority, planning). For agent-to-agent coordination (messaging, work claiming, file reservations), use MCP Agent Mail.

**CRITICAL: Use ONLY `--robot-*` flags. Bare `bv` launches an interactive TUI that blocks your session.**

### The Workflow: Start With Triage

**`bv --robot-triage` is your single entry point.** It returns:
- `quick_ref`: at-a-glance counts + top 3 picks
- `recommendations`: ranked actionable items with scores, reasons, unblock info
- `quick_wins`: low-effort high-impact items
- `blockers_to_clear`: items that unblock the most downstream work
- `project_health`: status/type/priority distributions, graph metrics
- `commands`: copy-paste shell commands for next steps

```bash
bv --robot-triage        # THE MEGA-COMMAND: start here
bv --robot-next          # Minimal: just the single top pick + claim command
```

### Command Reference

**Planning:**
| Command | Returns |
|---------|---------|
| `--robot-plan` | Parallel execution tracks with `unblocks` lists |
| `--robot-priority` | Priority misalignment detection with confidence |

**Graph Analysis:**

|---------|---------|
| `--robot-insights` | Full metrics: PageRank, betweenness, HITS, eigenvector, critical path, cycles, k-core, articulation points, slack |
| `--robot-label-health` | Per-label health: `health_level`, `velocity_score`, `staleness`, `blocked_count` |
| `--robot-label-flow` | Cross-label dependency: `flow_matrix`, `dependencies`, `bottleneck_labels` |
| `--robot-label-attention [--attention-limit=N]` | Attention-ranked labels |

**History & Change Tracking:**
| Command | Returns |
|---------|---------|
| `--robot-history` | Bead-to-commit correlations |
| `--robot-diff --diff-since <ref>` | Changes since ref: new/closed/modified issues, cycles |

**Other:**
| Command | Returns |
|---------|---------|
| `--robot-burndown <sprint>` | Sprint burndown, scope changes, at-risk items |
| `--robot-forecast <id\|all>` | ETA predictions with dependency-aware scheduling |
| `--robot-alerts` | Stale issues, blocking cascades, priority mismatches |
| `--robot-suggest` | Hygiene: duplicates, missing deps, label suggestions |
| `--robot-graph [--graph-format=json\|dot\|mermaid]` | Dependency graph export |
| `--export-graph <file.html>` | Interactive HTML visualization |

### Scoping & Filtering

```bash
bv --robot-plan --label backend              # Scope to label's subgraph
bv --robot-insights --as-of HEAD~30          # Historical point-in-time
bv --recipe actionable --robot-plan          # Pre-filter: ready to work
bv --recipe high-impact --robot-triage       # Pre-filter: top PageRank
bv --robot-triage --robot-triage-by-track    # Group by parallel work streams
bv --robot-triage --robot-triage-by-label    # Group by domain
```

### Understanding Robot Output

**All robot JSON includes:**
- `data_hash` — Fingerprint of source beads.jsonl
- `status` — Per-metric state: `computed|approx|timeout|skipped` + elapsed ms
- `as_of` / `as_of_commit` — Present when using `--as-of`

**Two-phase analysis:**
- **Phase 1 (instant):** degree, topo sort, density
- **Phase 2 (async, 500ms timeout):** PageRank, betweenness, HITS, eigenvector, cycles

### jq Quick Reference

```bash
bv --robot-triage | jq '.quick_ref'                        # At-a-glance summary
bv --robot-triage | jq '.recommendations[0]'               # Top recommendation
bv --robot-plan | jq '.plan.summary.highest_impact'        # Best unblock target
bv --robot-insights | jq '.status'                         # Check metric readiness
bv --robot-insights | jq '.Cycles'                         # Circular deps (must fix!)
```

### Morph Warp Grep — AI-Powered Code Search

Use `mcp__morph-mcp__warp_grep` for "how does X work?" discovery across the codebase.

When to use:

- You don't know where something lives.
- You want data flow across multiple files (model → attention → kernels).
- You want all touchpoints of a cross-cutting concern (e.g., synaptic plasticity, BDNF).

Example:

```
mcp__morph-mcp__warp_grep(
  repoPath: "/data/projects/bio_inspired_nanochat",
  query: "How does the presynaptic vesicle release mechanism work?"
)
```

Warp Grep:

- Expands a natural-language query to multiple search patterns.
- Runs targeted greps, reads code, follows imports, then returns concise snippets with line numbers.
- Reduces token usage by returning only relevant slices, not entire files.

When **not** to use Warp Grep:

- You already know the function/identifier name; use `rg`.
- You know the exact file; just open it.
- You only need a yes/no existence check.

Comparison:

| Scenario | Tool |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------- |
| "How does synaptic consolidation work?" | warp_grep |
| "Where is `PostsynapticHebb` defined?" | `rg` |
| "Rename `cfg` to `config`" | `ast-grep` |

## Memory System: cass-memory

The Cass Memory System (cm) is a tool for giving agents an effective memory based on the ability to quickly search across previous coding agent sessions across an array of different coding agent tools (e.g., Claude Code, Codex, Gemini-CLI, Cursor, etc) and projects (and even across multiple machines, optionally) and then reflect on what they find and learn in new sessions to draw out useful lessons and takeaways; these lessons are then stored and can be queried and retrieved later, much like how human memory works.

The `cm onboard` command guides you through analyzing historical sessions and extracting valuable rules.

### Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Check status and see recommendations
cm onboard status

# 2. Get sessions to analyze (filtered by gaps in your playbook)
cm onboard sample --fill-gaps

# 3. Read a session with rich context
cm onboard read /path/to/session.jsonl --template

# 4. Add extracted rules (one at a time or batch)
cm playbook add "Your rule content" --category "debugging"
# Or batch add:
cm playbook add --file rules.json

# 5. Mark session as processed
cm onboard mark-done /path/to/session.jsonl
```

Before starting complex tasks, retrieve relevant context:

```bash
cm context "<task description>" --json
```

This returns:
- **relevantBullets**: Rules that may help with your task
- **antiPatterns**: Pitfalls to avoid
- **historySnippets**: Past sessions that solved similar problems
- **suggestedCassQueries**: Searches for deeper investigation

### Protocol

1. **START**: Run `cm context "<task>" --json` before non-trivial work
2. **WORK**: Reference rule IDs when following them (e.g., "Following b-8f3a2c...")
3. **FEEDBACK**: Leave inline comments when rules help/hurt:
   - `# [cass: helpful b-xyz] - reason`
   - `# [cass: harmful b-xyz] - reason`
4. **END**: Just finish your work. Learning happens automatically.

### Key Flags

| Flag | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `--json` | Machine-readable JSON output (required!) |
| `--limit N` | Cap number of rules returned |
| `--no-history` | Skip historical snippets for faster response |

stdout = data only, stderr = diagnostics. Exit 0 = success.

## UBS Quick Reference for AI Agents

UBS stands for "Ultimate Bug Scanner": **The AI Coding Agent's Secret Weapon: Flagging Likely Bugs for Fixing Early On**

**Golden Rule:** `ubs <changed-files>` before every commit. Exit 0 = safe. Exit >0 = fix & re-run.

**Commands:**
```bash
ubs file.py file2.py                    # Specific files (< 1s) — USE THIS
ubs $(git diff --name-only --cached)    # Staged files — before commit
ubs --only=python bio_inspired_nanochat/  # Language filter (3-5x faster)
ubs --ci --fail-on-warning .            # CI mode — before PR
ubs --help                              # Full command reference
ubs sessions --entries 1                # Tail the latest install session log
ubs .                                   # Whole project (ignores .venv automatically)
```

**Output Format:**
```
⚠️  Category (N errors)
    file.py:42:5 – Issue description
    💡 Suggested fix
Exit code: 1
```
Parse: `file:line:col` → location | 💡 → how to fix | Exit 0/1 → pass/fail

**Fix Workflow:**
1. Read finding → category + fix suggestion
2. Navigate `file:line:col` → view context
3. Verify real issue (not false positive)
4. Fix root cause (not symptom)
5. Re-run `ubs <file>` → exit 0
6. Commit

**Speed Critical:** Scope to changed files. `ubs bio_inspired_nanochat/synaptic.py` (< 1s) vs `ubs .` (30s). Never full scan for small edits.

**Bug Severity:**
- **Critical** (always fix): Null safety, tensor shape mismatches, NaN/Inf guards, async/await errors, memory leaks
- **Important** (production): Type narrowing, division-by-zero, resource leaks
- **Contextual** (judgment): TODO/FIXME, debug prints

**Anti-Patterns:**
- ❌ Ignore findings → ✅ Investigate each
- ❌ Full scan per edit → ✅ Scope to file
- ❌ Fix symptom (`if x: x.y`) → ✅ Root cause (`x.y if x else None`)

## RCH — Remote Compilation Helper

RCH offloads `cargo build`, `cargo test`, `cargo clippy`, and other compilation commands to a fleet of 8 remote Contabo VPS workers instead of building locally. This prevents compilation storms from overwhelming csd when many agents run simultaneously.

**RCH is installed at `~/.local/bin/rch` and is hooked into Claude Code's PreToolUse automatically.** Most of the time you don't need to do anything if you are Claude Code — builds are intercepted and offloaded transparently.

To manually offload a build:
```bash
rch exec -- cargo build --release
rch exec -- cargo test
rch exec -- cargo clippy
```

Quick commands:
```bash
rch doctor                    # Health check
rch workers probe --all       # Test connectivity to all 8 workers
rch status                    # Overview of current state
rch queue                     # See active/waiting builds
```

If rch or its workers are unavailable, it fails open — builds run locally as normal.

**Note for Codex/GPT-5.2:** Codex does not have the automatic PreToolUse hook, but you can (and should) still manually offload compute-intensive compilation commands using `rch exec -- <command>`. This avoids local resource contention when multiple agents are building simultaneously.

## Project-Specific Notes

### Architecture Overview

This project implements bio-inspired neural network mechanisms:

1. **Presynaptic** (`synaptic.py`) - Vesicle fatigue, calcium dynamics, release probability
2. **Postsynaptic** (`synaptic.py`) - Hebbian learning, CaMKII/PP1 kinetics, BDNF metaplasticity
3. **Structural** (`synaptic_splitmerge.py`) - MoE expert lifecycle (neurogenesis/pruning)

### Kernel Backends

Three implementations exist for critical paths:
- **Triton GPU** (`kernels/`) - Production GPU kernels
- **Rust CPU** (`rust_src/`) - Fast CPU fallback via PyO3/maturin
- **Python reference** - Readable reference implementations for testing

When modifying biological mechanisms, ensure consistency across all backends.

### Key Testing Patterns

```bash
# Run all tests
uv run python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Run specific test file
uv run python -m pytest tests/test_bdnf_metaplasticity.py -v

# Run with short traceback
uv run python -m pytest tests/ --tb=short
```

### Training/Evaluation Scripts

All scripts are in `scripts/` and run as modules:

```bash
uv run python -m scripts.base_train
uv run python -m scripts.base_eval
uv run python -m scripts.tune_bio_params optimize --seed 42
```

---

## ast-grep vs ripgrep (quick guidance)

**Use `ast-grep` when structure matters.** It parses code and matches AST nodes, so results ignore comments/strings, understand syntax, and can **safely rewrite** code.

* Refactors/codemods: rename APIs, change import forms, rewrite call sites or variable kinds.
* Policy checks: enforce patterns across a repo (`scan` with rules + `test`).
* Editor/automation: LSP mode; `--json` output for tooling.

**Use `ripgrep` when text is enough.** It's the fastest way to grep literals/regex across files.

* Recon: find strings, TODOs, log lines, config values, or non-code assets.
* Pre-filter: narrow candidate files before a precise pass.

**Rule of thumb**

* Need correctness over speed, or you'll **apply changes** → start with `ast-grep`.
* Need raw speed or you're just **hunting text** → start with `rg`.
* Often combine: `rg` to shortlist files, then `ast-grep` to match/modify with precision.

**Snippets**

Find structured code (ignores comments/strings):

```bash
ast-grep run -l Python -p 'def $NAME($PARAMS): $$$BODY'
```

Find all class definitions with inheritance:

```bash
ast-grep run -l Python -p 'class $NAME($PARENT): $$$BODY'
```

Quick textual hunt:

```bash
rg -n 'def forward' -t py
```

Combine speed + precision:

```bash
rg -l -t py 'torch\.nn' | xargs ast-grep run -l Python -p 'import torch.nn as $ALIAS' --json
```

**Mental model**

* Unit of match: `ast-grep` = node; `rg` = line.
* False positives: `ast-grep` low; `rg` depends on your regex.
* Rewrites: `ast-grep` first-class; `rg` requires ad-hoc sed/awk and risks collateral edits.

## Beads Workflow Integration

When starting a beads-tracked task:

1. **Pick ready work** (Beads)
   - `br ready --json` → choose one item (highest priority, no blockers)
2. **Reserve edit surface** (Mail)
   - `file_reservation_paths(project_key, agent_name, ["bio_inspired_nanochat/**"], ttl_seconds=3600, exclusive=true, reason="br-123")`
3. **Announce start** (Mail)
   - `send_message(..., thread_id="br-123", subject="[br-123] Start: <short title>", ack_required=true)`
4. **Work and update**
   - Reply in-thread with progress and attach artifacts/images; keep the discussion in one thread per issue id
5. **Complete and release**
   - `br close br-123 --reason "Completed"` (Beads is status authority)
   - `release_file_reservations(project_key, agent_name, paths=["bio_inspired_nanochat/**"])`
   - Final Mail reply: `[br-123] Completed` with summary and links

Mapping cheat-sheet:
- **Mail `thread_id`** ↔ `br-###`
- **Mail subject**: `[br-###] ...`
- **File reservation `reason`**: `br-###`
- **Commit messages (optional)**: include `br-###` for traceability

---

## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - `uv run ruff check --fix`, `uv run ty check`, `uv run python -m pytest tests/`
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   br sync --flush-only
   git add .beads/
   git commit -m "Update beads"
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds

## cass — Cross-Agent Session Search

`cass` indexes prior agent conversations (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini, ChatGPT, etc.) so we can reuse solved problems.

**Rules:** Never run bare `cass` (TUI). Always use `--robot` or `--json`.

### Examples

```bash
cass health
cass search "async runtime" --robot --limit 5
cass view /path/to/session.jsonl -n 42 --json
cass expand /path/to/session.jsonl -n 42 -C 3 --json
cass capabilities --json
cass robot-docs guide
```

### Tips

- Use `--fields minimal` for lean output
- Filter by agent with `--agent`
- Use `--days N` to limit to recent history

stdout is data-only, stderr is diagnostics; exit code 0 means success.

Treat cass as a way to avoid re-solving problems other agents already handled.

---

## Note for Codex/GPT-5.2

If you are Codex or GPT-5.2 (or any non-Claude agent): another agent (often Claude Code) may have made changes to the working tree since you last saw it. Before assuming your mental model of the code is correct:

1. Run `git status` to see uncommitted changes
2. Run `git log --oneline -5` to see recent commits
3. Re-read any files you plan to modify

This prevents you from overwriting another agent's work or making edits based on stale context

## Note on Built-in TODO Functionality

Also, if I ask you to explicitly use your built-in TODO functionality, don't complain about this and say you need to use beads. You can use built-in TODOs if I tell you specifically to do so. Always comply with such orders.
