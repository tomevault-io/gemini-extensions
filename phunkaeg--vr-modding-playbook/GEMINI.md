# Using this playbook

Read `CLAUDE.md` once as the paired entry point. For RE work, read
[the shared agent workflow](AGENT_RE_WORKFLOW.md) once, then route below.
Use `vr-re-workflow` and `re-mcp-toolkit` for selected procedures; session tool
discovery determines availability (`cheatengine`, Ghidra, optional `local-llm`, etc.).

**Read the relevant route, not the playbook end to end.**

It is a large corpus; current measured size and source counts live in
[coverage](docs/coverage.md). The retrieval layer is built so you rarely open a whole
chapter. A normal lookup is one table row plus one
linked section — a few hundred words. Reading a chapter end to end is almost always the
wrong move, and reading several is a sign you skipped the routing below.

## Route by what you have

| What you have | Go to | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **A symptom** — something looks or behaves wrong | [`docs/failure-atlas.md`](docs/failure-atlas.md) | Symptom → *fast discriminator* → likely cause → route. The discriminator is the point: it is chosen to be cheap. |
| **A symptom, but you want the chapter** | [`docs/symptom-index.md`](docs/symptom-index.md) | Short rows mapping what you see to the chapter that covers it |
| **A solved problem you need the recipe for** | [`docs/pattern-catalog.md`](docs/pattern-catalog.md) | 148 atomic patterns, stable IDs, five fixed fields each |
| **A new or inherited target** | [`docs/start-new-port.md`](docs/start-new-port.md) | The router. Classifies integration authority first, then sends you down the RE-owned or source-owned route |
| **Several plausible next steps** | [`docs/bottleneck-map.md`](docs/bottleneck-map.md) | The earliest uncleared dependency, in order. Its *Agent operating protocol* section is worth reading once. |
| **A question of "has anyone solved this?"** | [`docs/cross-project-index.md`](docs/cross-project-index.md) | Who solved what, and where the raw working lives |
| **A target whose engine/API you know** | `python tools/prior_art.py <engine> <api>` | Matching tracked prior art, with what was harvested and what is thin |
| **Maths you are about to write yourself** | `docs/a1`–`a5` | Working code with the test that catches the error. Rotation, pose pipeline, stereo projection, hook safety, noise floor. |
| **A term used oddly** | [`docs/glossary.md`](docs/glossary.md) | Camera, pose, stereo, lifecycle, render and evidence vocabulary |
| **"Did another project already hit this?"** | `graphify explain "<concept>" --graph cross-engine-graph/graphify-out/fleet-graph.json` | Fleet documentation with cross-project concept links; inspect current coverage |

**On that graph, in short.** Start with `explain` on a **concept name**, not `query` on a sentence:
seed matching is lexical and unstemmed, so a plain-English question lands on whatever noun happens to
collide (*"how do projects stop geometry being culled"* once seeded on a minigame, because *game* and
*flat* matched). `explain "Frustum and Culling Adjustment"` returns every project's implementation in
one hop. For `query`, use engine nouns — `frustum culling`, `viewmodel pose handoff`, `9On12`.

It tells you *where* a problem was solved — which project, which document, which named symbol — and
never *what the answer was*, so treat every hit as a lead and read the document it names.
Cross-project edges are graded `INFERRED` and carry the concept and the reason, so you can reject a
bad link on sight.

**What it will not announce.** It indexes **documentation, not code**, and it is a **snapshot**:
absence means nobody wrote it down, or wrote it after the build. Coverage is uneven — MoH-VR (39
nodes) and SoF-VR (46) joined on 2026-09-07 and have far smaller corpora than SS2VR (659), so a
thin result for a young project is a statement about its documentation. Rebuild and extension
instructions are in [`cross-engine-graph/README.md`](cross-engine-graph/README.md).

**If the first stereo image will not fuse**, skip all of the above and go straight to the
[five-minute alignment diagnosis](docs/09-d3d11-openxr-injection.md). Every project in the
fleet hit it and none recognised it first time.

## Two ID namespaces, deliberately distinct

- `CAM-001` — a **pattern**: a reusable recipe in the pattern catalog.
- `FAIL-CAM-001` — a **failure record**: a symptom row in the failure atlas.

They are never the same record. Cite the qualified form for failures. IDs are permanent and
are never recycled; a retired pattern keeps its ID and gains a status note.

**Several agents write to this repository at once, so re-read the ID ceiling immediately before
you allocate one** — not from earlier in your session, and not from a number you were told.

```bash
grep -o "FAIL-CAM-[0-9]*" docs/failure-atlas.md | sort -u | tail -1
```

`git pull` does not protect you here: fleet agents commit straight into this working copy rather
than through the remote, so a colliding row can appear between your first read and your write with
no divergence to fetch. `tools/verify.py` catches the duplicate — this only saves you the
renumbering. (*Measured 2026-09-05: `FAIL-RE-024` was allocated twice in one afternoon, once by a
session that had read the ceiling forty minutes earlier.*)

## Three orthogonal axes

Knowing one tells you little about the others, and conflating them causes bad estimates:

- **Mode** — how you build it (injector, managed plugin, framework companion, source port,
  engine recreation). See chapter 18.
- **Stereo rung** — how the second eye is produced (`R1` native re-entry … `R4` reconstruction).
- **Completeness tier** — how much of the game becomes VR (`T0`–`T4`). See chapter 08.

A source port can ship at T1; an injector can reach T4.

## If you are working on a fleet project

Paste this into the project's own `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md`:

> **Playbook:** `D:\Dev Debug\VR Modding\` — read its `AGENTS.md` first, never the chapters
> end to end. Route by symptom (`docs/failure-atlas.md`), by recipe
> (`docs/pattern-catalog.md`), or by earliest blocker (`docs/bottleneck-map.md`). Cite pattern
> IDs (`CAM-001`) and failure IDs (`FAIL-CAM-001`) in this project's own docs so findings stay
> traceable in both directions.

Before acting on the playbook's picture of *your* project, **verify it against your own
current state**. The fleet ledgers summarise; your project's receipts are authoritative. If
they disagree, your receipts win — and say so, so the ledger gets fixed rather than quietly
diverging.

## If you are contributing back

For a substantial finding or failed approach, follow [research receipts](docs/research-receipts.md).
`tools/research_receipt.py` creates/validates a project-owned record and submits a
candidate for review. Keep validity, fact verdict, baseline health, evidence grade
and observation environment separate. Intake does not promote claims, allocate IDs,
clear bottlenecks, or authorize runtime work. Review candidates with `list`, read
their evidence, update the owning document, then record the editorial decision.

**Grade every claim.** `SPEC` normative API fact · `SOURCE` read in the project's own source ·
`STATIC` binary/static RE · `LIVE` observed at runtime · `HEADSET` accepted in a headset ·
`AUTHOR` the author's claim, unchecked · `INFERENCE` transferable hypothesis, not established
on this target.

*Known limitation:* `LIVE` currently spans three different things — your code running inside
the target, external tools observing the target, and real-hardware measurement with no target
process at all. If your evidence is not in-game, say so in the note; do not let the grade imply
it.

**Preserve ambiguous outcomes as ambiguous.** Do not promote a maybe to a confirmed or a
refuted. A negative result with its reason attached is worth as much as a positive one, and
costs a session to re-derive if you drop it.

**Never hand-edit anything under `docs/generated/`.** It is produced from `sources.yml` and
`bottlenecks.yml`. Edit the ledger, then regenerate.

**Validate before you claim it works:**

```
python tools/verify.py
```

Ten checks — source ledger, interaction coverage, bottleneck ledger, retrieval-ID integrity,
entry-point links, project instruction pairs, reference maths, strict site build, and every
internal anchor, and integration regression tests. PASS requires measured input;
NO_DATA is incomplete (exit 2). `--quick` / `--portable` explicitly name omitted checks.

Do **not** pipe validators through `tail` or `head` to trim their output. A shell pipeline
returns the *pipe's* exit status, so a failing check reports success. That mistake hid a real
regression here for an entire session. `verify.py` exists so there is no reason to.

## What not to do

- Do not read chapters end to end to "get up to speed". Route instead.
- Do not add a fact in a second place. Routers route, workflows establish authority, the spine
  owns artifacts and exit proofs, chapters own technical method, project receipts own
  target-specific facts. If a summary and a chapter disagree, **the chapter is authoritative**.
- Do not treat a source oracle as the shipping target. An SDK, an open ancestor, a sibling
  engine or a decompilation can name things correctly and still be the wrong bytes. Confirm
  against the shipping binary before relying on a layout, an address or an ABI.
- Do not mark a bottleneck cleared because code exists. Clear it when its named exit proof
  passes on the target whose row is changing.
