pnpm check-examples
pnpm check-demo
pnpm check-readme

# Benchmark the CLI with the given args
pnpm bench ./examples/input/javascript.node.base.cpuprofile

# Report which categories the examples emit, and which none emits
pnpm categories

pnpm categories --rule '^LinearScan'

# Generate inputs
pnpm generate-inputs           # --missing: skip already-generated inputs
pnpm generate-inputs --all     # Delete targets first, regenerate all
pnpm generate-inputs go ruby   # Limit to named workload scripts
```

## Testing

- Uses `vitest` and `@fast-check/vitest`
- `*.test.ts` and `testing.ts` are colocated with implementation
- Most tests run profile to Markdown conversion end-to-end
  - Assert on the Markdown output, not on intermediate data structures, using
    the Markdown assertion helpers in the colocated `testing.ts` files (e.g.
    `src/modalities/call-stack-profile/testing.ts`)
  - Fully assert on Markdown tables with `toEqual` and complete expected rows.
    NEVER index into tables or rows (e.g. `tables[0]`, `rows[0]`) or assert on
    individual cells, which would miss extra tables, rows, or cells
- A parameterized test over the committed `examples/input/` files must run in
  the input-processing vitest projects, or every conversion runs one at a time
  in a single worker: add its test file to `inputProcessingFiles` in
  `vitest.config.ts`, and take its inputs from `injectedInputs()` in
  `src/formats/testing.ts` rather than the input directory, since a format's
  inputs span several size-balanced projects. Register the file's
  input-independent tests only when `injectedFormat()` returns `undefined` (the
  `unit` project)

## Principles

### Dimensions

@.claude/dimensions.md

### Registration

- A format registers in exactly one place (in `src/formats/registry.ts`)
- An origin in exactly one place (in `src/origins/specs/index.ts`)
- One origin per profiler, always: every tool or runtime that writes inputs
  registers its own origin, even when its inputs carry no detectable markers.
  Origins sharing runtime conventions share logic through helper modules (e.g.
  `src/origins/jvm.ts`), never a merged spec: a later behavioral split must not
  break published origin IDs
- A format's `fallbackOrigin` is its canonical origin, the tool or runtime whose
  definition of the format the other emitters write to match. It is `unknown`
  when no emitting origin is canonical, because the format is defined by
  something that profiles nothing itself (e.g. the speedscope viewer). When
  adding an origin, revisit the fallback of every format it emits
- NEVER add logic that requires editing another file when a new format or origin
  is added. Express per-format or per-origin behavior as data or functions in
  the registry to derive from everywhere else
- When a derivation can't be type-enforced, guard it with a test that loops over
  the registry or the committed inputs so an omission fails the test

### Inputs

- A profiler emits the formats it writes itself. A separate tool that rewrites
  one of its outputs into another format converts
- Commit an input in a format its profiler emits. A converted input makes the
  language claim a format its ecosystem never writes, since a language's formats
  come from the `languages` of every registered converter
- When a profiler emits no supported format, the format is missing. Implement it
  (`/new-format`)

### Types

- Name a discriminated union's discriminant `type`, never `kind`. This does not
  apply to a categorical field that merely names a variant on a non-union type

### Errors

- Choose the class by who caused the failure: `ProfilerMdError` for the caller's
  input or options, its `CliError` subclass for a CLI-only failure (file access,
  output, flags), and a plain `Error` for a violated invariant, which is a bug.
  NEVER throw another built-in subclass such as `TypeError`, which nothing
  treats differently
- Pass `{ cause }` when wrapping a caught error. NEVER flatten it to its
  `message`
- A converter's `parse` throws a `FormatParseError` stating the reason alone,
  and the conversion pipeline prefixes the format's title. Write `matches` to
  accept anything of the format, including a version or variant the parser
  rejects, so auto-detection reports that reason instead of an undetectable
  input
- Write a message as `<what failed>: <detail>`, or as a single clause when there
  is no useful prefix. Put the offending value last, after `got: `.
  `eslint-rules/error-message.js` checks the remaining wording conventions
- Name what the caller controls (a flag, an option, a file path), never an
  internal function. An invariant message is the exception, since only a
  maintainer reads it
- Derive a format or origin name from the registry (e.g. `FormatMeta.title`),
  never a string literal

### Performance

- Prioritize runtime performance so large profiles process quickly
- Use low overhead abstractions
- NEVER use more than `O(n)` memory for a profile of size `n`
- Preallocate an array of known length with `new Array(length)`, not
  `Array.from({ length })`, which runs the iteration protocol per element

### Parsing

- Cast untyped profile data to typed data for performance. Validate only when
  necessary to make progress
- Parse a specified format to its spec, accepting every shape the spec allows.
  Add handling for a shape the spec forbids only when an input contains it, and
  name the emitter that writes it in a comment
- NEVER index into a plain object with profile-derived strings (e.g. frame
  names): keys like `toString` or `constructor` resolve to `Object.prototype`
  members. Use a `Map`

### Counting

- Decide what one unit of `Observation.count` counts from the profiler's source
  or spec, never the field's name: a profiler that samples the call stack on a
  schedule counts samples, and one that records an event per allocation or per
  contention counts those events. State the answer with
  `CallStackProfile.countMetric`
- Pass `countMetricOf('<singular noun>')` when the profiler counts occurrences
  of something else. The noun titles a metric-less profile, heads its count
  column, and follows the rate, so pick what one occurrence is. "object"
  produces "over 78 objects" and "1.69 MiB per object"
- Pass a time or size metric when one count measures a quantity rather than
  counting anything, so the counts format as that quantity and state no rate
- Pass `null` when the counts measure nothing, so the profile reports its
  metrics alone: a count the parser reconstructed (speedscope's evented
  profiles), or a missing count
- Where a format's emitters disagree on what one count measures, the origin
  overrides the same field with `OriginSpec.countMetric`
- NEVER count what the profiler did not record. Dropping the count costs a
  column; keeping it states a rate nothing measured

### Categorizing

- `FunctionCategory` is a closed set. Add a category only when the distinction
  it names exists across languages and its name states what it means without
  knowing which profiler wrote the input. One naming a stack position
  (`below main`) or an engine (`v8 api`) fails both
- Categorize from what the profiler states, never from what it omits. `stdlib`
  requires positive evidence that the code is the language's or runtime's own
  library: a path, module specifier, namespace, or package prefix. A frame the
  profiler attributed to no source file is `native`, and one it could not
  identify is `unknown`, so keep that distinction wherever a profiler draws it
- `compiler` is the runtime producing executable code, and `jit` a frame
  executing code the runtime generated. A named activity takes precedence over
  `jit`, so a garbage collection write barrier compiled inline is
  `garbage collector`
- Match on a name alone only behind a guard that excludes the profiled program's
  own code, and state it: a JavaScript engine locates every function the program
  defines, so a missing location is that guard
- Write a rule only for a shape a committed input contains. Measure one matching
  a long tail of symbols, and record what it matches and misses in its doc
  comment (e.g. `HOTSPOT_COMPILER` in `src/origins/jvm.ts`)
- `src/origins/categorize.test.ts` holds the cross-origin invariants, and
  `src/categories.test.ts` requires an example to emit every category, or a
  listed reason why nothing reaches it

### Aggregating

- NEVER sort, filter by `topN`, or apply any other formatting logic
- Use sequential IDs, `TypedArray`s, and compressed sparse row format when they
  improve performance
- Use sparse arrays over `Map<number, T>` for dense or moderately sparse data,
  common with sequential IDs
- NEVER assume parsed profile data contains sequential IDs unless the format's
  spec mandates them

### Formatting

- Use heaps to avoid fully sorting data when possible
- `src/cli/highlight.ts` heat-tints stdout by re-parsing the emitted Markdown
  (column headers like `%`, `Delta`, and `Location`, and `name (location)`
  heading keys), so a change to table or heading structure may require updating
  it
