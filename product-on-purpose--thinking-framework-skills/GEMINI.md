## thinking-framework-skills

> An evidence-graded library of agent-executable thinking-method skills, for AI agents and the humans who work with them. The plugin installs as `thinking-framework-skills`. Skill IDs are namespaced `thinking-framework-skills.<method>`, and installable skill names carry a `think-` prefix (for example `think-premortem`) to avoid cross-plugin collisions. Sibling to `pm-skills`, no technical coupling: `thinking-framework-skills` helps decide *what* to work on and *why* it is sound; `pm-skills` helps execute *how*.

# thinking-framework-skills - agent guide

An evidence-graded library of agent-executable thinking-method skills, for AI agents and the humans who work with them. The plugin installs as `thinking-framework-skills`. Skill IDs are namespaced `thinking-framework-skills.<method>`, and installable skill names carry a `think-` prefix (for example `think-premortem`) to avoid cross-plugin collisions. Sibling to `pm-skills`, no technical coupling: `thinking-framework-skills` helps decide *what* to work on and *why* it is sound; `pm-skills` helps execute *how*.

## What makes a skill here different

Each skill is built around four commitments, not just a prompt:

1. **Mechanism over ritual.** The skill implements the durable cognitive move, named descriptively, not a trademarked brand.
2. **Honest evidence grading.** Every skill carries an evidence tier and an `evidence/dossier.md` that says what the research does and does not support, and flags where evidence is transferred from human studies rather than validated for AI use.
3. **Artifact, not prose.** Every skill emits a concrete, reusable artifact (a risk register, an option matrix, a perspective review).
4. **Explicit "When NOT to Use."** Each skill states where it misleads, to guard against cargo-cult execution.

The canonical statement of all four commitments is in [Philosophy](https://thinking-framework-skills.productonpurpose.com/about/philosophy/) on the docs site.

63 skills, 11 at **S**/S-M tier - the named empirical core is fully shipped. **`think-framework-advisor` is the front door / meta-router:** describe a situation and it returns a prioritized, evidence-graded *Thinking Plan* of which of the other skills to use and why (graded M/C - honest that the routing itself is unvalidated; see its dossier). See `docs/internal/research/framework-catalog.md` for the full framework universe and roadmap.

## Recipes

Composable chains that solve a recurring job end to end. Each ships as a **workflow component** in [`_workflows/`](_workflows/) (a `steps:` list of skills) with human-readable prose in [`recipes/`](recipes/README.md). The plugin validates at **advanced (Gold)** tier, targeting Claude Code and Codex; native manifests are generated from `library.json` (do not hand-edit `.claude-plugin/` or `.codex-plugin/`). For machine consumption, the generated agent-discovery surfaces live at the site root: `llms.txt` (index), `llms-full.txt` (full inline catalog), `catalog.json` (invokable components), and `evaluated.json` (all 135 evaluated methods).

## Skill anatomy

```
skills/<name>/
  SKILL.md              # the procedure + frontmatter; what the agent reads
  references/
    TEMPLATE.md         # the structure the output artifact follows
    EXAMPLE.md          # a worked example that anchors quality
  evidence/
    dossier.md          # the graded evidence; the single source of truth
  skill.meta.yml        # rich sidecar (governance, taxonomy, relationships) - draft
```

## Conventions

- Skill IDs are namespace-dot: `thinking-framework-skills.<method>`. Installable skill names carry the `think-` prefix (`think-<method>`), declared as `prefix` in `library.json`.
- Skills target the open Agent Skills (`agentskills.io`) `SKILL.md` format, so they are portable across agents.
- Plugin and skill standards align to `agent-skills-toolkit` (advanced / Gold tier).
- No em-dashes or en-dashes anywhere in this repo's prose.
