# AGENTS.md — Varve

Local-first, cross-platform design suite. Native Rust engine on desktop
(Tauri 2), WASM behind the same facade on web. Linux (CachyOS/Arch) is the
primary dev OS.

## Toolchain (confirmed working, 2026-06-29)
- Rust: `~/.cargo/bin` (rustc 1.97 / cargo 1.97). Source with `. "$HOME/.cargo/env"`.
- pnpm 11.9: `~/.local/share/pnpm/bin`. Export `PNPM_HOME="$HOME/.local/share/pnpm"` and add `$PNPM_HOME/bin` to PATH.
- just 1.58: `~/.local/bin`.
- Node 26, npm 11.16.
- wasm32 target installed.
- WebKitGTK 2.52.4 / GTK 3.24.52 / librsvg / openssl / fontconfig / fuse2 confirmed via pkg-config.
- Optional: `cmake`, `xdotool` (not needed for core build).

## Validation economy — mandatory

**Validate according to impact, not repository size.** The full suite is an
explicit escalation/final-gate operation, not the default inner loop. Canonical
policy: `docs/quality/validation-strategy.md`. Executable planner:
`scripts/quality/affected-plan.mjs`.

1. Inspect `git status` / diff first.
2. Run `pnpm verify:plan` — the planner explains exactly what it selects
   and why, and what it deliberately skips.
3. Run `pnpm verify:affected` (Tiers 0–4, dependency-aware; `pnpm verify:quick`
   for trivial edits).
4. Add feature-specific E2E/visual/perf validation when the plan indicates.
5. Do NOT run `pnpm test`, `just gate`, full Playwright, or
   `cargo test --workspace` by default.
6. Full validation (`pnpm verify:full`) is reserved for explicit escalation
   conditions — workspace/toolchain changes, test-runner configuration,
   serialization/schema migrations, cross-package foundational API changes,
   release checkpoints, explicit request — and requires a stated reason.
7. Record exactly what was run, what passed, and what was skipped as
   unrelated (the Agent Validation Report template, below).

### Failure-resolution and release candidates

For a large integration or release candidate, do not restart a broad E2E
gate after every individual repair. Run `pnpm verify:triage` once to collect
a bounded failure set. Triage still runs the affected closure when the
planner requires a final full gate, exposing downstream compile failures
before that expensive checkpoint. Classify and repair each failure, and run its affected
compiler check, exact spec, and direct unit checks after each repair. Changes
under `tests/e2e/` automatically select `pnpm typecheck:e2e` before
Playwright. When the candidate is frozen, run `pnpm verify:affected` once
and then the required release `pnpm verify:full` gate. Shared E2E
infrastructure (`tests/e2e/shared.ts`,
`tests/e2e/helpers/**`, and fixtures), runner configuration, renderer, and
other integration surfaces deliberately retain broad validation scope.

Skipping affected tests is prohibited. Running unrelated tests is
discouraged — it consumes shared developer resources and delays feedback.

### Agent Validation Report (before claiming completion)

```text
Changed scope: <files / packages / crates>
Validation plan: <summary of pnpm verify:plan output>
Commands actually run: <exact commands>
Passed: <list>
Skipped as unrelated: <list + why>
Escalations: <list>
Full suite run: yes/no
If yes, reason: <stated reason>
```

## Regression protocol (mandatory after every architecture/system change)

After ANY change that touches:
- type definitions, interfaces, or generics
- imports, re-exports, or module boundaries
- function signatures or overloads
- state shape or context values
- test files or test infrastructure

Run in order:
```bash
pnpm verify:plan        # understand the impact first — never skip this
pnpm verify:affected    # Tiers 0-4. Tier 0 already covers format+lint on the
                        # touched files — no whole-repo format/lint runs per
                        # change; those belong to the full gate only.
pnpm bench              # benchmark mode for .bench.ts files (optional, perf-sensitive)
pnpm audit:docs         # docs naming/index/link drift — zero violations
pnpm audit:emoji        # zero violations
pnpm audit:tokens       # 120/120 WCAG-AA (3 themes)
```

The audits above are also auto-selected by the planner when the change
touches their domain (docs/emoji/tokens) — running them directly is a
belt-and-braces recheck, not a substitute for `verify:affected`.

Failure at any step means the change introduced a regression. Fix before committing.
Do NOT skip the affected checks — but do NOT run the full suite unless the
planner escalated (`FULL-SUITE ESCALATION: YES`) or a full-gate checkpoint
applies. When the planner escalates, run:

```bash
pnpm verify:full    # requires VARVE_FULL_GATE_REASON (see docs/quality/validation-strategy.md)
```

### Code-health check (triage gate)

After any system-level change (new context provider, new hub file, new tool system,
or any change to `context.tsx` / `CanvasArea.tsx` / `Shell.tsx`), run the
architecture audit to verify architectural metrics haven't regressed:

```bash
node scripts/audit-architecture.mjs --ci
```

These numbers drift with everyday merges — treat this table as orientation
and the audit output plus the committed baselines as the source of truth.
Enforced by `audit-architecture.mjs --ci` against `.architecture-baseline.json`
(live values 2026-08-22):

| Metric | Live (2026-08-22) | Enforced ceiling |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|
| Dependency cycles (madge, total distinct) | 15 | 19 (`max_cycles`) |
| Unstable modules (I > 0.9, all packages) | 49 | 49 (`max_unstable`) — at ceiling; a new unstable module fails the gate |
| Layer violations | 0 | 0 (`max_layer_violations`) |
| Unused exports | 0 | 10 (`max_unused_exports`) |

Reported but not enforced by `--ci`: per-package average/max cyclomatic
complexity (editor avg 27.9 on 2026-08-22; `complexity` in the architecture
baseline is intentionally empty), and per-hub import budgets — Shell (56),
Menubar (18), and context (76) print OVER BUDGET warnings against the
script's hardcoded budgets. Hub line/import *enforcement* lives in the
pre-commit health gate (`.health-baseline.json` via
`scripts/audit-health.mjs --staged`). Function-level complexity ceilings for
over-ceiling files (context.tsx 847, CanvasArea 630, …) live in
`scripts/audit-health.mjs` and are guarded by each file's first-line
`// COMPLEXITY:` comment.

See `docs/audits/architecture-health-baseline-2026-07-25.md` for the original
measurement methodology. If an enforced threshold is breached, stop and
investigate.
Use `node scripts/audit-architecture.mjs --update` to reset the baseline after
intentional improvements.

## Architecture constraints (do not violate)

Every rule below was discovered through root-cause investigation of real regressions.
Adding new violations will silently break tests and block CI.

### No circular `workspace:*` dependency chains

A package must never import from another package that transitively imports back to it.
TypeScript + Vite module resolution will either fail outright or produce non-deterministic
builds depending on evaluation order. To break a cycle, move the shared code into the
dependent package itself (or into `@varve/shared` if it belongs to no single owner).

### Sub-context `onReady` pattern (Session 44+)

`EditorProvider` in `context.tsx` composes sub-contexts (`MotionProvider`, `PrototypeProvider`,
`ViewportProvider`) as nested JSX children. A sub-context's hooks MUST NOT be called at the
`EditorProvider` function body level because the provider wrappers haven't mounted yet.
Instead, the sub-context accepts an `onReady` callback prop that reports its value back to
`EditorProvider` via `useState`. **New sub-contexts MUST follow this pattern** — see
`MotionProvider.onReady` in `MotionContext.tsx` and its usage inside `EditorProvider`
in `context.tsx`.

### ActionRegistry overwrite order

`Shell.tsx` calls `registerEditorActions(editor, callbacks)` BEFORE
`registerAllShortcuts(() => null)`. This ordering is required because `registerAllShortcuts`
pre-populates the registry with no-op stubs — if it runs first, the `r.has(id)` guard in
`registerEditorActions` silently skips registering real handlers. Any new registration path
must respect this priority: real handlers first, no-op stubs second.

### Module instability ceiling (Session 48+)

Hub files (Shell, CanvasArea) are inherently unstable. Every new import added to
them drags the whole module graph. Follow these rules:

1. **Hub files must not import leaf modules directly.** Before adding another import,
   ask: can the integration live in a thin adapter module?
2. **Prefer dependency injection over direct imports in hub files.**
3. **New hub files must target I < 0.85.**

| File | Imports (baseline / live 2026-08-22) | Instability (I) | Status |
|------|--------------------------------------|-----------------|--------|
| `CanvasArea.tsx` | 34 / 35 | ~0.90 | **Improved (was 82)** — drawContent/buildToolCtx/tool-sync extracted; must not increase |
| `Shell.tsx` | 56 / 56 | ~0.89 | **Over budget** — must not increase |
| `Menubar.tsx` | 17 / 18 | ~1.0 | At risk |
| `context.tsx` | 73 / 76 | ~0.48 | Healthy instability, but live count is exactly at `max_imports` (76) — one more import fails the pre-commit health gate |

Import counts are measured by `scripts/audit-health.mjs` against
`.health-baseline.json` (snapshot 2026-07-27; the "baseline" column above
mirrors it). Instability values come from madge via
`scripts/audit-architecture.mjs` at run time and are never persisted
(refresh with `--update` after intentional changes). Live import counts move
with everyday merges — when this table and the baseline disagree with a fresh
`node scripts/audit-health.mjs` run, believe the audit.

**No new import may be added to CanvasArea.tsx or Shell.tsx without first removing
an existing import of equal or greater weight.** Enforced by `scripts/audit-health.mjs`.

### Cyclomatic complexity ceiling — ENFORCED

| Context | Ceiling | Warning at | Block at |
|---------|---------|------------|----------|
| React component body | **200** | 160 (80%) | 200 |
| Non-component function | **50** | 40 (80%) | 50 |
| Tool handler (onPointerDown, etc.) | **30** | 24 (80%) | 30 |
| Test assertion body | **15** | 12 (80%) | 15 |

**70% rule:** When a function reaches 70% of its ceiling, any new
functionality MUST be extracted into a new function/module — not added
to the existing function. This is checked in pre-commit.

**Ceiling is a hard block, not a suggestion.** Pre-commit rejects
commits that increase complexity of any function already at or over its
ceiling. The only allowed operation on over-ceiling functions is
extraction (reducing their complexity).

**Over-ceiling files must have a `// COMPLEXITY:` comment** at the top
of the file with current complexity and a plan to reduce it. Without it,
pre-commit blocks any change to that file.

### Hook ordering invariance

React hooks must be called in the same order on every render. When extracting code
from `EditorProvider`:
1. Identify all hook dependencies
2. Create the hook function in `context/useX.ts`
3. Place the hook call AFTER all hooks it depends on and BEFORE the `value` useMemo
4. Add hook return values to the `value` useMemo dependency array
5. **Never split a hook call across conditionals, loops, or early returns**

See `context/usePersistence.ts` and `context/useBackgroundRemoval.ts` for the pattern.

### Never show pixels no fresh frame will replace

Partial (dirty-rect) redraw, the camera-only worker-bitmap fast path, and
`paintedSurfaceRef` all put previously-painted pixels on screen. Each is a
**loan against an authoritative frame that is on its way**. The moment the
pipeline knows no fresh frame is coming for the current state, it must fall
back to the main-thread replay (`compositorRef.current.drawVectorItems(ir)`),
which is always correct.

Concretely, every reason the render worker might decline a frame must be
decidable **synchronously**, before the frame picks its branch — that is what
`admitWorkerImagePayload` exists for. An async refusal (a `.then()` that
returns early) lands after the surface has already been painted, so the frame
composites the previous bitmap and, with nothing new ever posted, the canvas
freezes on it and merely reprojects it on every camera move. That is what made
a 13-image document render one image after fit-all and smear during scroll
(fixed 2026-08-11).

Do not treat partial redraw as the general answer to "the canvas is slow", and
do not assume it is the only thing that can put wrong pixels on screen — its
own guards (`surfaceMatchesBackingStore`, byte-exact camera equality) were
sound and were not the cause.

When touching any pixel-reuse logic, run the oracle instead of eyeballing it:
hash the surface after the interaction, call `window.__varvePerf.forceFullRedraw()`
at the same camera, hash again. Equal hashes mean the screen matches what a
full redraw would have produced. Frame-rate and handler-time metrics cannot
detect this class of bug. Background: `docs/architecture/render-pipeline.md`
→ "Reuse of already-painted pixels".

### Screen-space vs world-space thresholds

Anything compared against `clientX/Y` deltas is in CSS pixels and must not be
scaled by zoom — it models the user's hand, which does not rescale with the
camera. `BaseTool`'s drag threshold was `3 / zoom`, which demanded 50 CSS px of
travel at 6% zoom and fired on 0.19 px of jitter at 1600% (fixed 2026-08-11).
Use `worldDistanceForCssPixels` only where the result is compared against a
world-space delta.

Likewise, any overlay that draws over the artwork (SelectionOverlay, guides,
warp handles) must use the same camera transform as the renderer —
`screenToWorld` / `worldToScreen`, not the rotation-blind `simpleScreenToWorld`
/ `simpleWorldToScreen`. Those agree at rotation 0, so a mismatch stays
invisible until the view is rotated.

### The clean version is not always the fast version (render/replay hot path)

Varve is a design app — frame time beats complexity score. `renderPipeline.ts`'s
`replaySubtreeToCtx` (moved out of `CanvasArea.tsx` in the 2026-08-10 extraction;
and any function like it: a big `switch` over node/primitive
kind, called once per node per frame) is a classic case where the "obvious"
refactor — replacing the switch with a dispatch table or visitor pattern keyed by
`node.kind` — can make the hot path **slower**, not faster. A monomorphic
`switch` on a small closed set of string/enum kinds gets good branch prediction
and is a strong inlining candidate for the JIT; a table of closures
(`{ rect: fn, ellipse: fn, ... }[kind]()`) produces a megamorphic call site the
JIT can't specialize, which can cost more than the readability win is worth in a
loop that runs per-node-per-frame.

**Rule:** any structural change to `replaySubtreeToCtx`, `replayIr`, or an
equivalent per-node/per-frame dispatch function must be benchmarked before merge
(see the performance harness under `docs/quality/` — benchmark at 100 / 1k / 10k
/ 50k nodes, full-frame and incremental-frame). If a change regresses frame time,
**the readability improvement does not justify it in this specific function** —
revert or find a version that's both faster and clearer, don't ship the
regression on the strength of the diff looking nicer. This applies whether the
change comes from a manual refactor or an automated one (e.g. Stryker-adjacent
cleanup tooling, codemods).

## Commands (run from repo root)
- `pnpm install` — install JS deps
- `just check-env` — verify toolchain on PATH
- `pnpm verify:plan` — print the impact-aware validation plan for current changes (dry run; never skips silently — it explains what it selects and why)
- `pnpm verify:quick` — Tier 0 + Tier 1: format/lint on touched files + directly related tests
- `pnpm verify:affected` — Tiers 0–4, dependency-aware affected validation. **Default inner loop — use this instead of `pnpm test`.**
- `pnpm verify:full` — explicit full repository gate (Tier 5). Requires `VARVE_FULL_GATE_REASON` or `VARVE_FULL_GATE=1`
- `just check-plan` / `just check-quick` / `just check-affected` — just wrappers for the verify commands
- `just gate-full` — human-facing full gate (requires `VARVE_FULL_GATE_REASON`)
- `just test` — Rust (`cargo test --workspace`) + JS (`pnpm test` = Vitest). **Full-suite operation — not the default inner loop**
- `just lint` — `cargo clippy -D warnings` + `pnpm lint` (Biome)
- `just format` — `cargo fmt` + `pnpm format`
- `pnpm typecheck` — `tsc --noEmit` across packages/* (full workspace — `pnpm verify:affected` runs only the affected closure)
- `pnpm audit:tokens` — WCAG 2.2 AA token gate (120 checks across 3 themes)
- `pnpm audit:emoji` — zero-emoji gate
- `pnpm audit:docs` — docs drift gate (stale "Strata"/dead-path references in current-state docs, ADR index coverage, broken internal links). Historical docs (dated audits/plans/perf/session history/ADRs/CLA/licensing, and files under `docs/implementation-memory/`) may reference the old name; current-state docs must not.
- `pnpm --filter @varve/ui tokens:generate` — regenerate `tokens.css` from `color.ts`
- `just gate` — full Cascade Review gate (format-check + lint + test + audits) — **full-suite operation, kept as the compatibility alias**
- `pnpm e2e:visual` — visual regression projects only
- `pnpm e2e:all` — full Playwright suite
- Environment overrides: `VARVE_TEST_WORKERS` (vitest), `VARVE_E2E_WORKERS` (playwright), `VARVE_HEAVY_TASK_PARALLELISM=0` (opt out of heavy-task lease), `VARVE_E2E_PORT` (isolated dev-server port)

### CI/CD Commands
- `just install-ci-tooling` — install GitHub CLI, act, and Docker for local CI/CD
- `just install-ci-tooling` (with `bash scripts/install-ci-tooling.sh --check`) — verify act/container-engine parity for local runs
- `just pin-actions` — check for unpinned GitHub Actions (supply chain security)
- `just pin-actions-fix` — pin all GitHub Actions to commit SHAs
- `just validate-workflows` — validate all workflow YAML files
- `just validate-workflows-staged` — validate only staged workflow files
- `just act-list` — list available GitHub Actions jobs for local testing (no container engine needed)
- `just act-dry <workflow>` — dry-run a workflow to check execution plan (no container engine needed)
- `just act-run <job>` — run a specific GitHub Actions job locally (requires docker/podman running)
- `just ci-debug <run-id>` — generate the automated failure-debug report for a run
- `just ci-health` — classify recent run failures (billing-block / never-started / real-failure)
- `just ci-tools-test` — regression tests for the CI tooling itself

### Remote CI health (billing blocks and runner outages)

GitHub can block job startup for account-level reasons (failed payments,
spending limits) — every run fails in ~3s with zero steps recorded and
*"The job was not started because recent account payments have failed..."*.
This is NOT a code failure; no workflow edit fixes it. Diagnose with
`just ci-health` (prints `BILLING` per run) and resolve at
https://github.com/settings/billing. `ci-debug.mjs` classifies such jobs as
`billing-block` / `never-started` / `real-failure` (see `docs/CI_CD_RESILIENCE.md`).

## Automated UI/canvas testing

**If a bug involves the canvas, pointer/drag interaction, or "something doesn't
render/respond" — write and run a Playwright E2E test before declaring a fix verified.**
Vitest/RTL unit tests never dispatch real `PointerEvent`s through the real DOM and
never hit real browser APIs. A whole class of real bugs — broken CSS layout, overlays
eating pointer events, browser API throwing — is invisible to unit tests.

### Running E2E tests
```bash
npx playwright install chromium
npx playwright test tests/e2e --project=chromium --reporter=list
npx playwright test tests/e2e/canvas/tools.spec.ts --project=chromium --reporter=list
```

### Standard nav helper for canvas specs
```ts
async function navigateToEditor(page: import('@playwright/test').Page) {
  await page.goto('/');
  await page.getByRole('button', { name: /^new$/i }).waitFor({ timeout: 10000 });
  await page.getByRole('button', { name: /^new$/i }).click();
  await page.locator('dialog').getByRole('button', { name: /create/i }).waitFor({ timeout: 5000 });
  await page.locator('dialog').getByRole('button', { name: /create/i }).click();
  await page.locator('.layers-panel').waitFor({ timeout: 10000 });
  const welcomeClose = page.getByRole('dialog').getByRole('button', { name: /close|get started/i });
  if (await welcomeClose.first().isVisible({ timeout: 1000 }).catch(() => false)) {
    await welcomeClose.first().click();
  }
}
```

### Debugging recipe: collapsed or zero-size elements
Use `page.evaluate()` to pull real computed layout:
```ts
const info = await page.evaluate(() => {
  const el = document.querySelector('.some-element') as HTMLElement;
  const cs = getComputedStyle(el);
  return {
    rect: el.getBoundingClientRect().toJSON(),
    display: cs.display, height: cs.height, contain: cs.contain,
    parentClass: el.parentElement?.className,
  };
});
```

**Known trap — `<ErrorBoundary>` breaks CSS Grid/Flex placement.** Wrapping
something in `<ErrorBoundary>` that relies on being a direct grid/flex item
(such as `.editor-canvas`) collapses it to 0 height. Fixed by `display: contents`
on the ErrorBoundary wrapper.

### For future sessions
If the user reports "X doesn't work when I click/drag/interact," and X touches
CanvasArea, pointer events, or CSS layout:
1. Write a Playwright spec that drives the actual interaction
2. Run it. If it fails, use `page.evaluate()` to find the real DOM/CSS state
3. Only report a fix as done once the E2E test passes

## Architecture decisions
- **ADR-0001** — native engine renders by IR-replay (not pixel-push). Rust computes
  scene, emits compact IR (~42 KB/frame for 600 shapes); webview replays to canvas2D.
- **ADR-0002** — teal accent, 12-step neutral+teal ramps, Light/Dark/High-Contrast themes.
- **ADR-0003** — Canvas2D default, WebGPU opt-in with fallback.
- **ADR-0004** — varve-bridge + varve-wasm for shared IPC/WASM IR.
- **ADR-0005** — Offline-first ONNX: bundled models manifest, remote download explicit only.

## WebGPU + WASM program

| Area | Location |
|---|---|
| Baseline bench + goldens | `packages/engine/src/bench/`, `packages/engine/src/__goldens__/` |
| Compositor | `packages/compositor/` — Canvas2D + WebGPU scaffold |
| Render worker | `packages/editor/src/render/` — OffscreenCanvas |
| WASM build | `just wasm-build` → baseline + preferred SIMD artifacts in `apps/desktop/public/wasm/` |
| Architecture docs | `docs/architecture/render-pipeline.md`, `docs/architecture/wasm-backends.md` |

## Canvas System

| Area | Location |
|---|---|
| Camera + floating origin | `packages/shared/src/viewport.ts`, `packages/editor/src/canvas/cameraState.ts` |
| Sticky snap | `packages/editor/src/tools/snapping.ts` |
| Draw hub | `CanvasArea.tsx` |
| Minimap | `components/Minimap/` |
| Collab (stub) | `PresenceIndicator`, `CollabCursorOverlay`, `useCollabPresence` |
| Perf | `canvas10k.bench.test.ts`, `SubtreeReplayCache` |

## Image Trace System

Native raster-to-vector with honest web fallbacks. Canonical docs:
`docs/architecture/image-trace-system.md`, ADR-0170.

| Area | Location |
|---|---|
| Rust engine | `crates/varve-trace/` (contours, pixel_art, centerline, bezier_fit, quantize, hierarchy) |
| Native IPC | `trace_image` / `trace_image_binary` / `begin_trace_job` / `cancel_trace` + `trace:progress` (apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/lib.rs) |
| Provider chain + gating | `packages/engine/src/upscaleProviders/traceDispatch.ts` (native-first under Tauri), `rasterTrace.ts` fallback |
| Dialog/workflow | `packages/editor/src/components/Vectorize/` (presets, preview, complexity estimate, Edit Trace) |
| Insert/re-trace ops | `packages/editor/src/imageOperations.ts` (`insertTraceGroup`, `replaceTraceGroup`) |
| Provenance | `GroupNode.traceMetadata` (schema 2.16) + `packages/editor/src/logo/vectorization/metadata.ts` |
| E2E | `tests/e2e/canvas/image-trace.spec.ts` |

Key rules:
1. Desktop traces MUST prefer the native provider (chain is native-first under
   Tauri); never reorder it behind the TS fallbacks.
2. The wire options contract is camelCase (`rename_all = "camelCase"` in
   `TraceImageOptions`); snake_case keys are silently dropped.
3. Centerline is native-only: TS providers declare it unavailable instead of
   emitting filled silhouettes.
4. Traces are bounded: 128 MB bytes, 64 MPixels, 100 k paths; decode is
   dimension-pre-checked (bomb guard).
5. Trace insertion is one undo entry; re-traces replace the old group in
   place; metadata stores no raster bytes.

## Motion System

Complete timeline-based animation workspace. Canonical doc: `docs/architecture/motion-system.md`.

| **P5** | Extension types only (skeleton/IK/audio deferred) | `motion-types.ts` |

## Workspace Mode System

Eight task-focused modes over the same document/scene/rendering/command/history
systems. Canonical contract, configuration resolution, persistence, and known
gaps: `docs/architecture/workspace-system.md`.

| Mode | Shortcut | Default Tool | Focus |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Design** | `Ctrl+Shift+1` | select | UI/UX, components, prototyping |
| **Print** | `Ctrl+Shift+2` | select | Multi-page, typography, preflight, colour management |
| **Draw** | `Ctrl+Shift+3` | paint | Raster painting, vector freehand, brushes |
| **Photo** | `Ctrl+Shift+4` | select | Nondestructive photo editing, adjustments |
| **Motion** | `Ctrl+Shift+5` | select | Timeline animation, keyframes, easing |
| **Logo** | `Ctrl+Shift+6` | select | Wordmarks, marks, monograms, badges, brand systems |
| **Email** | `Ctrl+Shift+7` | select | Email template design, semantics, preview, export |
| **Codegen** | `Ctrl+Shift+9` | select | Code export |

Logo workflow docs: `docs/architecture/logo-system.md`,
`docs/plans/logo-system-progress.md`. New commands must register in
`ShortcutManager` + `createActionHandlers` + both menus; project state
lives in `Document.logoProject` (scene `logo/logoProject.ts`).

The bindings above come from the shortcut registry (`workspaceDesign` … in
`packages/editor/src/shortcuts/ShortcutManager.ts`). Older docs may show
`Ctrl+Shift+D/P/R/I/M` — those keys are now taken by Repeat Duplicate,
Present, Invert Selection, and Preview Mode, and do **not** switch
workspaces. Always resolve workspace shortcuts for display via
`workspaceShortcutLabel(mode)` (see `packages/editor/src/workspace/workspaceShortcutLabel.ts`),
never hard-code them.

### Invariants (do not violate)
1. Single document model — mode never forks the scene.
2. State preservation — switching modes preserves document, selection, viewport, undo history.
3. No remounting — mode switching patches `EditorState` only.
4. Safe interaction resolution — in-progress interactions committed before switch.
5. All tools accessible via keyboard shortcuts or command palette.
6. Shared commands — selection, transform, colour, layers, undo/redo, copy/paste identical.
7. One resolver — every consumer reads `getEffectiveWorkspaceConfig(mode)` (or
   the `useEffectiveWorkspaceConfig` hook), never `WORKSPACE_CONFIGS[mode]`
   directly. The raw map has no entry for an unknown mode; the resolver falls
   back to Design and merges the user's per-workspace overrides.
8. One switch path — `requestWorkspaceSwitch` on the editor context. It owns
   re-entrancy guarding, interaction resolution, and the announcement. Do not
   add a second entry point that patches workspace state directly.
9. No decorative config — every `WorkspaceConfig` field must have a runtime
   consumer. Key bindings and renderer policy are deliberately *not* workspace
   configuration; see the doc above for why.

## Text Pipeline

Multilingual text rendering, shaping, BiDi layout, and export. M1–M8 complete.
See `docs/architecture/text-pipeline.md`.

## Release signing (code-signing pipeline)

Varve's release pipeline is certificate-ready but not yet signing: no Apple/
Azure certificates are owned. Canonical docs: `docs/release/signing-decision-record.md`
(strategy + current prices), `docs/release/code-signing-setup.md` (human
acquisition checklist), `docs/release/signing-rotation-runbook.md` and
`docs/release/signing-incident-runbook.md` (procedures).

Rules that must not be violated:
- Signedness in `release-manifest.json` derives ONLY from post-build
  verification reports (`verify-windows-signature.ps1` /
  `verify-macos-signature.sh`), never from secret presence. `signing-policy.mjs`
  encodes the fail-closed policy; `verify-release-trust.mjs` enforces it before
  checksums/attestation/draft.
- Stable releases require valid Windows Authenticode and macOS
  Developer ID + notarized + stapled; missing credentials fail in
  `signing-preflight` BEFORE the platform build starts.
- Windows signing uses Azure Artifact Signing via Tauri `signCommand`
  (artifact-signing-cli 0.11.0). The auth chain is a client secret — OIDC is
  not supported by that tool; do not invent a replacement wrapper without
  re-checking official docs.
- macOS uses Developer ID Application (never Apple Development/Distribution);
  the identity string is matched exactly.
- Tauri updater keys (when the updater lands) are separate from all other
  signing material and are not created until then.

## Trust boundaries (do not violate)

Source sharing is not trust sharing. Canonical doc:
`docs/security/trust-boundaries.md`. Machine-enforced by
`scripts/security/validate-client-env.mjs` (client builds fail closed on
private credential classes), `scripts/secret-scan.mjs --dir/--canary` (built
artifacts are scanned, canary asserts no env leakage), the
`scripts/security/workflow-policy.mjs` deny-lists (backend/DNS credentials in
NO workflow; signing secrets only in release.yml gated on signed mode;
`VARVE_SIGNING_STEP_ALLOWED` only in release.yml), and
`scripts/security/import-boundaries.mjs` (apps never import each other;
packages never import apps; the future `apps/api` is unreachable from
clients). Run them with `pnpm audit:secrets`, `pnpm audit:clientenv`,
`pnpm audit:artifacts`, `pnpm audit:boundaries`; the regression tests run in
`pnpm test:ci:tools` and in ci.yml `pipeline-validate`.

Rules that must not be violated:
- Website and desktop builds consume only the documented client-safe
  allowlist (see trust-boundaries.md §5); never add a private credential
  class to a client build's environment.
- Never reference signing, backend, DNS, or updater-private credentials from
  any workflow other than the release pipeline paths the policy allowlists.
- No client app may import another app or the future backend; shared code
  lives in `packages/` only.
- GitHub Secrets never enter client artifacts; if a value must reach the
  artifact, it is public configuration by definition.

## Quality gates (Cascade Review) — every task must pass
TDD-first → tests green → token audit → zero emoji → axe-core zero violations
→ input-method audit → reduced-motion → 3-OS build → native backend on desktop.

## Multi-agent coordination

| Scenario | Strategy |
|---|---|
| Different crates/packages | Safe in parallel |
| Same package, different files | Safe in parallel if independent |
| Same file | **Must be sequential** — use `git worktree add` |
| Hub files intersect | After parallel agents, coordinator runs `just gate` |

**Heavy tasks (full vitest, Playwright, cargo workspace, desktop/WASM
builds) acquire a cross-worktree lease** before starting
(`scripts/quality/heavy-lease.mjs`) so concurrent agents do not saturate
the machine. Opt out deliberately with `VARVE_HEAVY_TASK_PARALLELISM=0`.

**Worktree protocol:** `git worktree add .worktrees/<feature> -b <feature>`, work, commit,
merge sequentially. Verify with `just gate` after each merge.

## Hard rules
- No emoji anywhere. SVG icons via Lucide `<Icon>` or Phosphor `<SolidIcon>` only.
- No hardcoded color/space/type values — trace to CSS custom properties.
- TS strict, no `any` (Biome enforces `noExplicitAny: error`).
- Rust `unsafe_code = deny` workspace-wide.
- Cross-platform: if it works on macOS but not Linux, it's not done.
- **No native `<select>` elements** — use `@varve/ui`'s custom `Select` component.
- **No AI tool attribution in commit messages or author metadata.** Do not add
  `Co-authored-by:` trailers for Claude, Devin, Copilot, Codex, ChatGPT,
  Gemini, Cursor, Windsurf, or any other AI tool. Do not add "Generated with
  [Devin]", "Generated by Claude", or similar attribution signatures. All
  commits are authored by the maintainer. AI tool output is reviewed and
  committed as the maintainer's work — it is not a separate legal
  contribution. A commit-msg hook (`.githooks/commit-msg`) enforces this.
  Do not disable it.

## Lifecycle System

Canonical doc: `docs/architecture/lifecycle-system.md`, ADR-0216.

- **One coordinator**: every graceful termination request converges on
  `TerminationCoordinator` (`packages/editor/src/lifecycle/`). No
  presentation component, native menu item, shortcut, OS event, or browser
  lifecycle event may independently decide that user data can be destroyed.
- **Intents are explicit**: `close-document` / `close-window` /
  `quit-application` / `reload` / `restart`. Back-to-Home never closes
  documents (Resume Editing keeps them mounted); quitting inspects ALL
  sessions, hidden or Home-hidden.
- **Native interception is authoritative on desktop**: Rust prevents
  `CloseRequested`/`ExitRequested` (main window only), asks the webview;
  one-shot per-window tokens in `LifecycleGuard` prevent recursion.
  Auxiliary windows close freely (ADR-0211 D1). macOS close-window keeps
  the app running; Linux/Windows last-window close exits.
- **Do NOT call `getCurrentWindow().close()` from UI code** for
  user-visible close operations — use `requestCloseWindow()`
  (`apps/desktop/src/lifecycle/requestCloseWindow.ts`) or the coordinator.
- **Dirty authority**: `state.sessions[]` per-session `dirty`. The save
  plan is revision-safe (a stale save never marks newer edits clean) and
  Save-As cancellation aborts the transaction — never "discard".
- **Clean marker** (`strata-clean-shutdown`) is written ONLY after
  finalization; a crash mid-quit stays unclean. Intentional discard deletes
  the tab's recovery points at commit (`deleteRecoveryForTab`).
- **Web**: beforeunload warns only when genuinely unsaved; pagehide/
  visibilitychange flush best-effort; never `await save()` in unload.
- **New termination entry points must flow through the coordinator**
  (request → guard → resolve → commit → native/browser terminate).

## Thumbnail System

Canonical doc: `docs/architecture/thumbnail-system.md`, ADR-0218.

One source of truth for every thumbnail/preview surface (Home cards, page
nav, pages panel, version history, picker). Thumbnails are a **platform
capability**: an explicit subject + source + revision + render profile +
privacy policy + deterministic cache identity.

- Contracts (`ThumbnailSourceSpec`, `ThumbnailVariant` + `THUMBNAIL_VARIANTS`,
  `ThumbnailStatus`, `ThumbnailPolicy`, `computeThumbnailIdentity`,
  `ENCRYPTED_PROJECT_PLACEHOLDER`) live in `packages/shared/src/thumbnail/`.
- Source resolution + automatic heuristic live in
  `packages/scene/src/thumbnail/resolve.ts` (pure, doc-domain).
- Rendering MUST go through `flattenSceneToEngine` (canonical canvas
  conversion) + engine `generateThumbnail`; never hand-roll a mini-renderer
  for covers. Page previews pass `localTransforms: true`.
- Cache keys are identity strings (`thumb:v2:...`), NEVER bare node/page
  ids or bare content hashes. Legacy bare-hash entries are disposable
  warm-migration fallbacks only.
- Scheduling: `ThumbnailScheduler` (concurrency 1, priority, dedupe by key,
  cancellation, stale-job guards). Background thumbnail work must never
  compete with canvas interaction.
- Persistence: `Platform.setThumbnailPreference` (FileEntry metadata, not
  document JSON) + `get/put/delete/evictThumbnail` keyed by identity.
- Generation is editor-owned (save path); Home only loads/displays.
- Encrypted projects: only the content-free placeholder may be stored;
  `clearProjectPreviewData` on the save path; Home forces the placeholder
  for encrypted records.
- UX entry points: File menu "Set File Thumbnail…", canvas context menu
  (Use Selection/Frame as File Thumbnail), page context menu (Use Page as
  File Thumbnail), command palette, `ThumbnailPickerDialog`.
- Legacy `renderThumbnail` (engine `thumbnail.ts`) is deprecated; do not
  add callers.
- Layers 28×28 node previews are a documented simplified node profile (not
  document covers).

## Masking System

Canonical doc: `docs/architecture/masking-system.md` — model, invariants,
compositing order, renderer parity, export semantics, effect targeting.

- Clipping relationship = a `GroupNode`/`FrameNode` whose `mask.type === 'clip'`
  points at one of its own children; every other child is clipped content.
- Invariants: source must be a direct child (frames/groups); masks are
  released when the matte leaves the container (`reparentNode`); mask/scope
  graphs are acyclic (`addMask` + `setMaskSourceNode` both run
  `detectMaskCycles`); adjustment nodes can never be mask sources.
- Copy/paste remaps mask sources and scope targets through the clone idMap;
  cross-document paste drops foreign references (`dropForeignReferences`)
  instead of leaking source-document ids.
- Adjustment spatial masks (clip/alpha/luminance on the adjustment node)
  compose with `scope`: scope = input set, mask = output region.
- Clip masks with invert/feather/density render through the alpha path;
  plain hard clips use `ctx.clip()`. Mask surfaces come from a bounded pool
  (`acquireMaskSurface`/`releaseMaskSurface`).
- E2E corpus: `tests/e2e/canvas/clipping-masks.spec.ts` (screenshots to
  `reports/masking-review/`).
