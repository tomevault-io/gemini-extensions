# Working with leanSpec

## Repository Overview

This is a Python repository for the Lean Ethereum Python specifications. It is set up as
a single `uv` project containing the main specifications and various cryptographic
subspecifications that the Lean Ethereum protocol relies on.

## Key Directories

- `src/lean_spec/` - Main specifications for the Lean Ethereum protocol
- `src/lean_spec/subspecs/` - Supporting subspecifications for cryptographic primitives
- `tests/` - Specification tests
- `docs/` - MkDocs documentation source

## Development Workflow

### Running Tests

```bash
uv sync                           # Install dependencies
uv run pytest                     # Run unit tests
uv run fill --fork=lstar --clean -n auto                # Generate test vectors
uv run fill --fork=lstar --clean -n auto --scheme=prod  # Generate test vectors with production scheme
# Note: execution layer support is planned for future, infrastructure is ready
# for now, `--layer=consensus` is default and the only value used.
```

### Code Quality

```bash
uv run ruff format       # Format code
uv run ruff check --fix  # Lint and fix
uvx tox -e typecheck     # Type check
uvx tox -e all-checks    # All quality checks
uvx tox                  # Everything (checks + tests + docs)
```

### Common Tasks

- **Main specs**: `src/lean_spec/`
- **Subspecs**: `src/lean_spec/subspecs/{subspec}/`
- **Unit tests**: `tests/lean_spec/` (mirrors source structure)
- **Consensus spec tests**: `tests/consensus/` (generates test vectors)
- **Execution spec tests**: `tests/execution/` (future - infrastructure ready)

## Code Style

- Line length: 100 characters, type hints everywhere
- Google docstring style
- Test files/functions must start with `test_`
- **No example code in docstrings**: Do not include `Example:` sections with code blocks in docstrings. Keep documentation concise and focused on explaining *what* and *why*, not *how to use*. Unit tests serve as usage examples.
- **No section separator comments**: Never use banner-style separator comments (`# ====...`, `# ----...`, or similar). They add visual clutter with no value. Use blank lines to separate logical sections. If a section needs a heading, a single `#` comment line is enough.
- **No backtick references in comments or docstrings**: Never use RST/Markdown backticks (`` `` ``) to reference identifiers in Python comments or docstrings. This is source code, not rendered documentation. Backticks add visual noise and make comments harder to scan. Just write the name directly.
- **Never use RST-style double backticks**: If a backtick is used anyway (e.g. when quoting a literal value inline), use a single `` ` `` (Markdown), never `` `` `` (RST). Double backticks are banned everywhere — comments, docstrings, and any other prose embedded in Python source.
- **CRITICAL - Preserve existing documentation**: When refactoring or modifying code, NEVER remove or rewrite existing comments and docstrings unless they are directly invalidated by the code change. Removing documentation that still applies creates unnecessary noise in code review diffs and destroys context that was carefully written. Only modify documentation when:
  - The documented behavior has actually changed
  - The comment references code that no longer exists
  - The comment is factually wrong after your change

### Import Style

**All imports must be at the top of the file.** Never place imports inside functions, methods, or conditional blocks. This applies to both source code and tests. The **only** exception is genuine circular dependencies — in that case, import inside the function that needs the type (see the `TYPE_CHECKING` rule below).

Bad:
```python
def process(data):
    from lean_spec.subspecs.ssz import hash_tree_root
    return hash_tree_root(data)
```

Good:
```python
from lean_spec.subspecs.ssz import hash_tree_root

def process(data):
    return hash_tree_root(data)
```

**Avoid confusing import renames.** When an external library exports a name that conflicts with a local type, prefer restructuring over renaming.

Bad:
```python
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.x25519 import (
    X25519PublicKey as CryptographyX25519PublicKey,
)
```

Good - import the module and use qualified access:
```python
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric import x25519

# Then use x25519.X25519PublicKey when needed
public_key = x25519.X25519PublicKey.from_public_bytes(data)
```

Good - move conflicting local types to a separate constants/types module:
```python
# In constants.py - no external dependencies that conflict
X25519PublicKey: TypeAlias = Bytes32

# In crypto.py - import from constants, use qualified access for external
from .constants import X25519PublicKey
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric import x25519
```

This keeps code readable and avoids mental overhead of tracking renamed imports.

**CRITICAL - Never use `TYPE_CHECKING`.** The `if TYPE_CHECKING:` pattern is banned entirely from this codebase. Do not import `TYPE_CHECKING` from `typing`, and do not place any imports behind `if TYPE_CHECKING:` guards. This pattern is fragile, hard to maintain, and causes subtle bugs — especially with Pydantic models.

Instead:

- **No circular dependency?** Just import normally at the top of the file. Most guarded imports have no actual cycle.
- **Genuine circular dependency?** Import inside the function that needs it. This is the **only** exception to the top-level import rule. Keep the local import as close as possible to where it's used.
- **Forward references needed?** Use quoted strings (`"ClassName"`) in annotations, or add `from __future__ import annotations` (but NOT in Pydantic model files).

Bad:
```python
from typing import TYPE_CHECKING

if TYPE_CHECKING:
    from lean_spec.subspecs.forkchoice import Store

def process(store: "Store") -> None: ...
```

Good:
```python
from lean_spec.subspecs.forkchoice import Store

def process(store: Store) -> None: ...
```

Good (local import for genuine circular dependency):
```python
def verify_signatures(self, state: "State") -> bool:
    from ..state import State

    # use State here
    ...
```

### Type Annotations

**Never quote type annotations when `from __future__ import annotations` is present.** With future annotations, all annotations are already lazy strings. Adding quotes is redundant and noisy.

Bad:
```python
from __future__ import annotations

def create(cls) -> "Store":
    ...
```

Good:
```python
from __future__ import annotations

def create(cls) -> Store:
    ...
```

The only valid use of quoted annotations is in files that do NOT have `from __future__ import annotations` and need a forward reference. Prefer adding the future import instead.

**Prefer narrow domain types over raw builtins.** Use `Bytes32`, `Bytes33`, `Bytes52` etc. instead of `bytes` in signatures. Spec code should never accept or return `bytes` when a more specific type exists.

### Module-Level Constants

Use docstrings (not comments) to document module-level constants. Place the docstring immediately after the assignment.

Bad:
```python
# Noise protocol name - used to initialize the handshake state
# This is the full protocol name per the Noise spec
PROTOCOL_NAME: bytes = b"Noise_XX_25519_ChaChaPoly_SHA256"
```

Good:
```python
PROTOCOL_NAME: bytes = b"Noise_XX_25519_ChaChaPoly_SHA256"
"""Noise protocol name per the Noise spec. Used to initialize the handshake state."""
```

This pattern:
- Is recognized by documentation tools (Sphinx, mkdocs)
- Shows up in IDE tooltips and autocomplete
- Keeps documentation close to the code it describes

### Documentation Rules (CRITICAL)

**NEVER use explicit function or method names in documentation.**

Names change. Documentation becomes stale. Use plain language instead.

Bad:
```python
# The shutdown task waits for stop() to be called, then signals
# all services to terminate. Once all services exit, TaskGroup completes.
```

Good:
```python
# A separate task monitors the shutdown signal.
# When triggered, it stops all services.
# Once services exit, execution completes.
```

**Write short, scannable sentences.**

Attention spans are short. Capture the reader precisely and concisely.

- One idea per line.
- Add blank lines between logical groups.
- Avoid long compound sentences.

Bad:
```python
# The state includes initial checkpoints, validator registry,
# and configuration derived from genesis time.
```

Good:
```python
# Includes initial checkpoints, validator registry, and config.
```

**Use bullet points or enumeration for lists.**

When listing multiple items, use structured formatting. Helps readers maintain focus.

Bad:
```python
"""
The verification checks structural validity, cryptographic correctness,
and state transition rules before accepting the block.
"""
```

Good:
```python
"""
The verification checks:

- Structural validity
- Cryptographic correctness
- State transition rules
"""
```

Or with numbered steps:
```python
"""
Processing proceeds in order:

1. Validate input format
2. Check signatures
3. Apply state transition
4. Update forkchoice
"""
```

Bad:
```python
"""
Wait for shutdown signal then stop services.

This task runs alongside the services. When shutdown is signaled,
it stops both services, allowing their run loops to exit gracefully.
"""
```

Good:
```python
"""
Wait for shutdown signal then stop services.

Runs alongside the services.
When shutdown is signaled, stops all services gracefully.
"""
```

### Testing Style (CRITICAL)

**Always use full equality assertions.** Never assert individual fields when you can assert the whole object. This catches more bugs and replaces multiple lines with a single, complete check.

Bad:
```python
assert len(capture.sent) == 1
_, rpc = capture.sent[0]
assert rpc.control is not None
assert len(rpc.control.prune) == 1
```

Good:
```python
assert capture.sent == [
    (peer_id, RPC(control=ControlMessage(prune=[ControlPrune(topic_id=topic, backoff=60)])))
]
```

Bad:
```python
event = queue.get_nowait()
assert event.peer_id == peer_id
assert event.topic == "topic"
```

Good:
```python
assert queue.get_nowait() == GossipsubPeerEvent(
    peer_id=peer_id, topic="topic", subscribed=True
)
```

When order is non-deterministic (random peer selection), assert exact RPC shape and exact peer set separately:
```python
expected_rpc = RPC(control=ControlMessage(graft=[ControlGraft(topic_id=topic)]))
assert {p for p, _ in capture.sent} == expected_peers
assert all(rpc == expected_rpc for _, rpc in capture.sent)
```

## Test Framework Structure

**Two types of tests:**

1. **Unit tests** (`tests/lean_spec/`) - Standard pytest tests for implementation
2. **Spec tests** (`tests/consensus/`) - Generate JSON test vectors via fillers
   - *Note: `tests/execution/` infrastructure is ready for future execution layer work*

**Test Filling Framework:**

- Layer-agnostic pytest plugin in `packages/testing/src/framework/pytest_plugins/filler.py`
- Layer-specific packages: `consensus_testing` (active) and `execution_testing` (future)
- Write consensus spec tests using `state_transition_test` or `fork_choice_test` fixtures
- These fixtures are type aliases that create test vectors when called
- Run `uv run fill --fork=Lstar --clean -n auto` to generate consensus fixtures
- Use `--layer=execution` flag when execution layer is implemented
- Output goes to `fixtures/{layer}/{format}/{test_path}/...`

**Example spec test:**

```python
def test_block(state_transition_test: StateTransitionTestFiller) -> None:
    state_transition_test(
        pre=genesis_state,
        blocks=[block],
        post=StateExpectation(slot=Slot(1))  # Only check what matters
    )
```

**How it works:**

1. Test function receives a fixture class (not instance) as parameter
2. Calling it creates a `FixtureWrapper` that runs `make_fixture()`
3. `make_fixture()` executes the spec code (state transitions, fork choice steps)
4. Validates output against expectations (`StateExpectation`, `StoreChecks`)
5. Serializes to JSON via Pydantic's `model_dump(mode="json")`
6. Writes fixtures at session end to `fixtures/{layer}/{format}/{test_path}/...`

**Layer-specific architecture:**

- `framework/` - Shared infrastructure (base classes, pytest plugin, CLI)
- `consensus_testing/` - Consensus layer fixtures, forks, builders
- `execution_testing/` - Execution layer fixtures, forks, builders
- Regular pytest runs (`uv run pytest`) ignore spec tests - they only run via `fill` command

**Serialization requirements:**

- All spec types (State, Block, Uint64, etc.) must be Pydantic models
- Custom types need `@field_serializer` or `model_serializer` for JSON output
- SSZ types typically serialize to hex strings (e.g., `"0x1234..."`)
- Fixture models inherit from layer-specific base classes:
  - Consensus: `BaseConsensusFixture` (in `consensus_testing/test_fixtures/base.py`)
  - Execution: `BaseExecutionFixture` (in `execution_testing/test_fixtures/base.py`)
  - Both use `CamelModel` for camelCase JSON output
- Test the serialization: `fixture.model_dump(mode="json")` must produce valid JSON

**Key fixture types:**

- `StateTransitionTest` - Tests state transitions with blocks
- `ForkChoiceTest` - Tests fork choice with steps (tick/block/attestation)
- Selective validation via `StateExpectation` and `StoreChecks` (only validates fields you specify)

## Important Notes

- Python 3.12+ required
- Use Pydantic models for validation
- Keep specs simple, readable, and clear
- Repository is `leanSpec` not `lean-spec`
- **Always run linter checks before finishing**: Run `uvx tox -e all-checks` at the end of any code changes to ensure all linting, formatting, type checking, and spell checking passes.
- **CRITICAL - NO BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY**: This is a STRICT requirement. NEVER add backward compatibility code under any circumstances. This means:
  - NO legacy constants (like `KEY_TYPE_ED25519 = KeyType.ED25519`)
  - NO wrapper functions that delegate to new classes
  - NO re-exports of deprecated APIs
  - NO deprecation shims or aliases
  - When refactoring from functions to classes, DELETE the old functions entirely
  - Update ALL call sites to use the new API directly
  - Old patterns must be REMOVED, not preserved alongside new ones

## SSZ Type Design Patterns

When creating SSZ types, follow these established patterns:

### Domain-Specific Types (Preferred)

- Use meaningful names that describe the purpose: `JustificationValidators`, `HistoricalBlockHashes`, `Attestations`
- Define domain-specific types in modular structure (see Architecture section below)
- Avoid generic names with numbers like `Bitlist68719476736` or `SignedAttestationList4096`

### SSZType vs SSZModel Design Decision

**SSZType (IS-A pattern)**: Use for types that *are* data

- Primitive scalars: `Uint64`, `Boolean`, `Bytes32`
- These inherit directly from their underlying Python types
- Example: `Uint64(42)` *is* the integer 42 with SSZ serialization

**SSZModel (HAS-A pattern)**: Use for types that *have* data

- Collections: `SSZList`, `SSZVector`, bitfields
- Containers: `State`, `Block`, etc.
- These use Pydantic models with a `data` field for contents
- Example: `MyList(data=[1, 2, 3])` *has* a list of data with SSZ serialization

**Key principle**: If the type conceptually *holds* or *contains* other data, use SSZModel for consistent validation and immutability.

### Modular Architecture

Containers should be organized into modules with clear separation:

```
src/lean_spec/subspecs/containers/
├── state/
│   ├── __init__.py      # Exports State and related types
│   ├── state.py         # Main State container class
│   └── types.py         # State-specific types: JustifiedSlots, HistoricalBlockHashes, etc.
├── block/
│   ├── __init__.py      # Exports Block classes
│   ├── block.py         # Main Block container classes
│   └── types.py         # Block-specific types: Attestations, etc.
└── ...
```

**Key principles:**

- **Base types** (BaseBitlist, SSZList, etc.) stay in general scope (`src/lean_spec/types/`)
- **Spec-specific types** go in their respective modules (`state/types.py`, `block/types.py`)
- **Public API** exposed through `__init__.py` files for backward compatibility
- **Domain-specific types** defined close to where they're used

### Examples

**Good domain-specific types:**

```python
# In state/types.py
HISTORICAL_ROOTS_LIMIT = 262144

class JustificationValidators(BaseBitlist):
    """Bitlist for tracking validator justifications."""
    LIMIT = HISTORICAL_ROOTS_LIMIT * HISTORICAL_ROOTS_LIMIT

# In block/types.py
class Attestations(SSZList):
    """List of signed attestations included in a block."""
    ELEMENT_TYPE = SignedAttestation
    LIMIT = 4096  # VALIDATOR_REGISTRY_LIMIT
```

**Avoid generic types:**

```python
# Don't do this:
class Bitlist68719476736(BaseBitlist): ...
class SignedAttestationList4096(SSZList): ...
```
