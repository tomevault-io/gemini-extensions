This project uses OpenLore for persistent architectural memory.

ALWAYS call `orient()` (via the openlore MCP server, or `npx openlore orient --json`)
before reading source files when starting a new task. This returns the relevant
functions, callers, spec sections, and insertion points for the task at hand —
one structural lookup instead of file-by-file rediscovery.

OpenLore prefixes tool responses with a brief, factual freshness note (the
Epistemic Lease) once your cached context has aged or the repo has moved since
your last `orient()`. It is informational — re-`orient()` if you are relying on
cached cross-module structure; otherwise carry on.

For the MCP setup, ensure `openlore mcp` is configured as an MCP server.
See https://github.com/clay-good/OpenLore for details.

## OpenSpec exploration with OpenLore

OpenSpec and OpenLore are independent tools with complementary responsibilities:

- OpenSpec captures intended behaviour, requirements, scenarios, design decisions,
  and implementation tasks.
- OpenLore provides evidence about the existing implementation: entry points,
  ownership, call paths, dependencies, tests, specifications, and likely impact.

When exploring, proposing, reviewing, or updating an OpenSpec change for existing
functionality, call `orient()` early, even if no source file has been opened yet.
Describe both the intended capability and the relevant OpenSpec change when known.

Use the result to:

1. identify existing entry points and responsible modules;
2. find behaviour or constraints missing from the OpenSpec artifacts;
3. detect reuse opportunities, conflicts, and overlap with other functionality;
4. locate relevant tests and existing specifications;
5. estimate the implementation surface and risks.

Reconcile three sources of truth explicitly:

1. the requested intent;
2. the OpenSpec artifacts;
3. the implementation evidence returned by OpenLore.

OpenLore evidence informs the exploration but does not replace requirements or
silently redefine the intended behaviour. When the sources disagree, report the
discrepancy and resolve it in the OpenSpec artifacts before implementation.

For a purely greenfield or conceptual exploration, `orient()` may return little
useful evidence; continue with OpenSpec and state that no relevant implementation
surface was found. If OpenLore is unavailable, use targeted repository inspection
and report the fallback.

## Tooling & CLI Constraints
- ALWAYS use `rg` (ripgrep) instead of `grep` for code search and file inspection.
- NEVER run recursive `grep -r` commands. `rg` is faster and respects `.gitignore`.

## Documentation impact before every PR

Before opening or updating any pull request:

1. Inspect the diff for changes that affect documented behaviour: user flows, CLI
   commands and flags, configuration keys/defaults, environment variables, APIs,
   UI behaviour, deployment, compatibility, prerequisites, or developer workflows.
2. Search every relevant user and developer document (`README.md`, `docs/`, package
   READMEs, examples, and operational guides) for the affected concepts.
3. Compare affected claims, examples, and commands against the implementation,
   schemas, CLI help, package scripts, and tests. Update stale documentation in the
   same PR.
4. Validate changed documentation proportionately: local links and anchors, fenced
   JSON, documented commands, and externally referenced facts where applicable.
5. Add a `Documentation impact` note to the PR description. List the files updated,
   or state `None` with a brief reason when the diff has no documentation impact.

This is an impact review, not a mandatory full reread of unrelated documentation.

## Spec scenario coverage

Before calling a feature complete, prove that every applicable OpenSpec scenario
is covered by testing:

1. Follow the OpenSpec exploration with OpenLore workflow above, then enumerate
   every `#### Scenario:` in
   the relevant main and delta specs. Verify the list with
   `rg '^#### Scenario:' openspec/` so scenarios cannot be silently omitted.
2. Produce an explicit scenario-to-test matrix. Classify every scenario as
   `covered`, `partial`, or `uncovered`, and include the test file and test name.
   Prefer the exact scenario name in the test title or a machine-readable
   `openlore` coverage annotation when the test framework supports it.
3. Read the assertions, not only the test names or suite result. A scenario is
   `covered` only when its GIVEN/WHEN/THEN contract would make the test fail if
   broken. Timing, ordering, negative cases, security boundaries, and observable
   outcomes must be checked at the real boundary described by the spec.
4. Use OpenLore's available coverage, inventory, impact, and spec-drift tools
   when relevant. If an MCP tool is unavailable, use its CLI or `rg` fallback
   and report that fallback.
5. For enumerated surfaces such as routes, commands, or schemas, compare tests
   against the production inventory/source of truth. A hand-maintained test-only
   list is not sufficient proof that newly added cases are covered.
6. Run focused tests first, then the relevant suites and strict OpenSpec
   validation. UI or agent-behaviour scenarios must also follow the Playwright
   running-app rule below.

Do not mark OpenSpec tasks complete or report the feature done while a required
scenario is `partial` or `uncovered`. If a correct test exposes a product bug,
keep the assertion strong: fix the implementation when in scope, otherwise
report the blocker instead of weakening the test.

## UI and UX changes: test them in the running app

Any change that touches the interface **or the way it is used** — a component, a
tool the agent calls, a tool's description, a message the model reads — must be
exercised in the running app with Playwright before it is called done. Unit tests
are necessary and they are not sufficient.

Three failures from one session, none of which any suite caught:

- A PDF viewer that released documents through the wrong object. The throw landed
  in an effect cleanup, so **the whole application unmounted** and the user saw a
  blank page. The test fake had grown a method the real API never had.
- A file-creation input that closed itself on a refused duplicate, swallowing the
  error. It inferred success from a side effect the failure produces too.
- An extraction tool that worked perfectly when driven directly, while the agent
  kept not using the option that made it worth having. The mechanism was right;
  the behaviour was not.

The pattern: a fake is kinder than reality, an outcome is inferred rather than
observed, or the code is correct and the *use* of it is not. Only the running app
shows those.

What "exercised" means: drive the actual feature — create the file, open the
document, ask the agent for the thing — then read back the DOM, the filesystem, or
the session transcript to check what really happened. A screenshot is not a check.

### Do not stop at the happy path

Once the intended walkthrough passes, make a second pass whose only goal is to
break it. The happy path is the sequence the code was written against, so it is
the one least likely to be broken; the defects live in the transitions.

Hammer it like a monkey tester: rapid and double clicks, a menu left open while
the context under it changes, switching projects or sessions mid-request,
clicking a file that was just deleted on disk, spamming expand/collapse, acting
before the first data has arrived, and clicking in an order nobody would design
for. Remove things underneath the running app — delete the directory, revoke the
permission, kill the repository — and watch what it claims afterwards.

Read back the DOM after each burst, and watch for the shapes that only show up
here: stale state rendered under a new context, a reply answering a question that
has since changed, a handler assuming an object it no longer holds, a panel stuck
loading a request nobody made. Report what broke, not merely that the feature
works.

Two defects in the per-repository git work were exactly of this shape, and both
had green suites over them: a commit log rendered under another project's name,
and — once that was correlated — a menu that sat on "loading…" forever because
the fetch only happened on the toggle.
