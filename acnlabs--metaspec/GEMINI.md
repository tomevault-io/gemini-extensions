# Meta-Spec AI Agent Guide

> **For AI Assistants**: This document provides guidance on using Meta-Spec to generate Spec-Driven X (SD-X) speckits.

---

## 🎯 Your Role

You are helping a developer create **speckits** (spec-driven toolkits for AI agents) using MetaSpec. 

MetaSpec is a meta-specification framework that generates complete Spec-Driven X (SD-X) speckits:
- **SD-Development** - Spec-driven development
- **SD-Design** - Spec-driven design systems
- **SD-Testing** - Spec-driven testing frameworks
- **SD-Documentation** - Spec-driven documentation
- **SD-Operations** - Spec-driven operations
- **SD-X** - Spec-driven generation for any domain

**Key principle**: MetaSpec generates production-ready speckits with CLI, parser, validator, templates, and AI agent support

---

## 💡 Core Concept: Meta-Specification Framework

MetaSpec is a **meta-specification framework** - it uses specifications to generate specification toolkits.

```
Meta-Specification (MetaSpec)
        ↓
  Defines how to define specifications
        ↓
Generates Speckits (Spec-driven Toolkits)
        ↓
Speckits carry domain specifications
        ↓
Used to develop domain projects
```

### Key Insights

1. **Meta-level abstraction** - MetaSpec defines how to create specification systems
2. **Generative framework** - Generates complete speckits from meta-specifications
3. **Recursive architecture** - MetaSpec uses SDD to develop itself, generates speckits that use SDD
4. **Specification-centric** - Domain specs are the source of truth, speckits are carriers

**Example Flow**:
```
MetaSpec (meta-spec)
    ↓ generates
MCP-Spec-Kit (carries MCP specification spec)
    ↓ used by
Developer (validates MCP servers against spec)
```

**This means**: MetaSpec is not just "spec-driven development" - it's a framework that **generates speckits** (spec-driven toolkits) for any domain.

**See [Recommended Practice: SDS + SDD Separation](#recommended-practice-sds--sdd-separation) in MetaSpec Commands section for how speckits separate domain specifications from toolkit implementation.**

---

## 📋 CLI Commands

MetaSpec provides these commands:

- `metaspec init [name]` - Create speckit (interactive or template-based)
- `metaspec search <query>` - Search community speckits
- `metaspec install <name>` - Install from community
- `metaspec contribute <name>` - Contribute to community
- `metaspec list` - List installed speckits  
- `metaspec info <name>` - Show speckit information

Use these commands in your workflow to help users create and discover speckits.

## 🔒 Constitutional Principles

**ALWAYS follow** `memory/constitution.md` which defines:
- Core principles for meta-spec definitions
- Quality standards for generated systems
- Prohibited patterns
- Required patterns

### Constitution Structure

The constitution is organized into **three parts**:

```
memory/constitution.md
├── Part I: Project Core Values (Managed by: /speckit.constitution)
│   - AI-First Design
│   - Progressive Enhancement
│   - Minimal Viable Abstraction
│   - Domain Specificity
│
├── Part II: Specification Design Principles (Managed by: /metaspec.sds.constitution)
│   - Entity Clarity
│   - Validation Completeness
│   - Operation Semantics
│   - Implementation Neutrality
│   - Extensibility Design
│   - Domain Fidelity
│   - Workflow Completeness ⭐ NEW
│
└── Part III: Toolkit Implementation Principles (Managed by: /metaspec.sdd.constitution)
    - Entity-First Design
    - Validator Extensibility
    - Spec-First Development
    - AI-Agent Friendly
    - Progressive Enhancement
    - Automated Quality
```

**Key principles:**
1. **Minimal Viable Abstraction** (Part I): Don't over-abstract
2. **AI-First Design** (Part I): Generated systems must be AI-friendly
3. **Progressive Enhancement** (Part I): Start with MVP, add features incrementally
4. **Domain Specificity** (Part I): Respect domain constraints
5. **Workflow Completeness** (Part II): ⭐ **NEW** - Define complete user workflows, not just isolated operations

---

## 🚀 Workflow-Driven Design Philosophy

**CRITICAL NEW PRINCIPLE** (v0.7.0+): MetaSpec now requires **workflow-first design** for all domain specifications.

### Two Types of Workflows ⭐ UPDATED v0.8.0

**IMPORTANT**: There are TWO types of workflows in specifications. Understanding the distinction is critical.

#### Type 1: Entity State Machines (Business Execution)

**What**: Lifecycle of individual entities during business operations  
**Example**: Order (pending → confirmed → shipped → delivered)  
**Used by**: Business logic, domain operations  
**Defines**: Status field transitions, business rules  

```yaml
Order Entity:
  status: [pending, confirmed, shipped, delivered]
  transitions:
    - pending → confirmed (when: payment verified)
    - confirmed → shipped (when: items packed)
    - shipped → delivered (when: customer receives)
```

#### Type 2: Specification Usage Workflow (Specification Creation) ⭐ NEW

**What**: End-to-end process of creating and using the specification itself  
**Example**: SDS Workflow (Constitution → Specify → Clarify → ... → Implement)  
**Used by**: Users creating specifications, AI agents  
**Defines**: Action steps, slash commands, quality gates  

```yaml
SDS Workflow:
  Step 1: Constitution → /metaspec.sds.constitution
  Step 2: Specify → /metaspec.sds.specify
  Step 3: Clarify → /metaspec.sds.clarify
  ...
  Step 8: Implement → /metaspec.sds.implement
```

**Key Distinction**:
- **Type 1**: How entities change during business execution (WHAT happens)
- **Type 2**: How to create/use/validate the specification (HOW to use speckit)

**Most speckits need BOTH**:
- Type 1: Define entity lifecycles (if domain has stateful entities)
- Type 2: **Required for all Speckits** - Define specification creation workflow

### Why Workflow Matters

❌ **Don't build**: "Toolbox" (collection of isolated operations)  
✅ **Do build**: "Workflow Systems" (integrated end-to-end user journeys)

### The Problem We Solved

**Before v0.7.0**: Developers could create speckits that passed all quality checks but lacked clear user workflows. Users received "13 commands" without knowing which to use first, or how they relate.

**After v0.7.0**: All domain specifications MUST define:
1. **Workflow Phases** - Distinct stages in the user journey (Type 2)
2. **Phase Purposes** - Why each phase exists
3. **Operation Mapping** - Which operations belong to which phase
4. **Sequencing** - Entry/exit criteria, dependencies, ordering
5. **End-to-End Examples** - Complete workflow demonstrations
6. **Entity State Machines** - If domain has stateful entities (Type 1)

### MetaSpec as Example

MetaSpec itself demonstrates perfect workflow design:

```
SDS Workflow:
  Phase 1: Constitution → /metaspec.sds.constitution
  Phase 2: Specification → /metaspec.sds.specify
  Phase 3: Quality Gates → /metaspec.sds.clarify, /metaspec.sds.checklist
  Phase 4: Implementation → /metaspec.sds.plan, /metaspec.sds.tasks, /metaspec.sds.implement
  Phase 5: Validation → /metaspec.sds.analyze

SDD Workflow:
  Phase 1: Constitution → /metaspec.sdd.constitution
  Phase 2: Specification → /metaspec.sdd.specify, /metaspec.sdd.clarify
  Phase 3: Architecture → /metaspec.sdd.plan, /metaspec.sdd.checklist
  Phase 4: Implementation → /metaspec.sdd.tasks, /metaspec.sdd.analyze, /metaspec.sdd.implement
```

**Your mission**: Ensure all speckits you help create follow this same pattern.

### Required Workflow Elements

When defining domain specifications, ALWAYS include:

1. **Phase Definitions**
   ```yaml
   Phase 1: [Name]
     Purpose: [Why this phase exists]
     Entry: [When user enters]
     Operations: [Which operations]
     Outputs: [What is produced]
     Exit: [When complete]
   ```

2. **Operation-to-Phase Mapping**
   - Every operation MUST belong to at least one workflow phase
   - No "orphan" operations without clear usage context

3. **Workflow Examples**
   - Show complete end-to-end usage
   - Demonstrate phase transitions
   - Include success indicators

4. **Decision Points**
   - Document when users choose between paths
   - Explain branching logic
   - Provide decision criteria

### Enforcement

The new **Part II Principle 7: Workflow Completeness** ensures:
- `/metaspec.sds.constitution` includes workflow requirements
- `/metaspec.sds.specify` generates Workflow Specification sections
- `/metaspec.sds.checklist` (future) validates workflow completeness
- `/metaspec.sds.analyze` (future) scores workflow quality

### Examples

**Good Workflow-Driven Design** (Type 2: Specification Usage Workflow):
```
MetaSpec SDS Workflow:
  Phase 1: Foundation
    - Operations: /metaspec.sds.constitution
    - Output: Specification design principles
  
  Phase 2: Specification
    - Operations: /metaspec.sds.specify, /metaspec.sds.clarify
    - Output: Domain specification document
  
  Phase 3: Quality Gates
    - Operations: /metaspec.sds.checklist, /metaspec.sds.analyze
    - Output: Quality validation reports
  
  Phase 4: Implementation (if complex)
    - Operations: /metaspec.sds.plan, /metaspec.sds.tasks, /metaspec.sds.implement
    - Output: Sub-specifications
```

**Good Entity State Machine** (Type 1: Business Execution):
```
Specification Entity (MetaSpec itself):
  States: draft → review → approved → deprecated
  Transitions:
    - draft → review (when: ready for feedback)
    - review → approved (when: quality checks pass)
    - approved → deprecated (when: replaced by new version)
```

**Bad (Pre-v0.7.0) Design**:
```
Specification Operations (no workflow):
  - /spec.create (what's this for?)
  - /spec.validate (when to use?)
  - /spec.analyze (how does this relate to create?)
  ❌ Users confused about sequence and relationships
```

- [ ] Forbidden transitions are documented
- [ ] Validation rules for state changes defined

**Constitution**:
- [ ] Constitution Part II includes Workflow Completeness principle

## 🤝 Spec-Driven Development for Speckits

Generated **speckits** (spec-driven toolkits) include **MetaSpec commands** in `.metaspec/commands/` to assist AI in understanding and generating the speckit.

**Speckits** are specialized toolkits generated by MetaSpec that:
- Carry domain specifications as core assets
- Include built-in MetaSpec commands for development
- Follow spec-driven architecture patterns

These commands provide a complete workflow from specification definition to controlled evolution (19 commands total: 8 SDS + 8 SDD + 3 Evolution).

See [MetaSpec Commands section](#-metaspec-commands-specification-lifecycle-management) for the complete command reference.

---

## 🎯 MetaSpec Commands: Specification Lifecycle Management

When you generate a speckit, it includes MetaSpec (Spec-Driven X) commands in the `.metaspec/commands/` directory. These commands manage the **specification lifecycle**.

### Command Groups

MetaSpec uses a three-layer architecture to separate concerns:

#### SDS (Spec-Driven Specification) - 8 Commands
For defining domain specifications:

- `/metaspec.sds.constitution` - Update Part II of constitution (Specification Design Principles)
- `/metaspec.sds.specify` - Define specification entities, operations, validation rules
- `/metaspec.sds.clarify` - Clarify underspecified areas (recommended BEFORE plan; input quality gate)
- `/metaspec.sds.plan` - Plan specification architecture and sub-specifications
- `/metaspec.sds.tasks` - Break down specification work
- `/metaspec.sds.analyze` - Cross-artifact consistency check (run AFTER tasks, BEFORE implement; checkpoint)
- `/metaspec.sds.implement` - Write specification documents (creates sub-spec files, NOT code)
- `/metaspec.sds.checklist` - Generate quality checklist (like "unit tests for specifications"; output quality gate)

**Location**: Works with `specs/domain/` directory (stores domain specifications)
**Constitution**: Updates Part II in `/memory/constitution.md`

#### 🌳 Recursive Tree Structure (NEW)

**SDS supports recursive specification hierarchy**:

**IMPORTANT**: Physical structure is **FLAT**, logical structure is **TREE**.

**Physical Structure** (flat directory layout):
```bash
specs/domain/
├── 001-order-specification/     # All at same level
├── 002-order-creation/
├── 003-payment-processing/
├── 013-credit-card-payment/     # Same level, not nested
├── 014-digital-wallet-payment/
└── 015-bank-transfer-payment/
```

**Logical Structure** (tree via frontmatter):
```
001-order-specification (root)
  ├── 002-order-creation (leaf)
  ├── 003-payment-processing (parent)
  │   ├── 013-credit-card-payment (leaf)
  │   ├── 014-digital-wallet-payment (leaf)
  │   └── 015-bank-transfer-payment (leaf)
  └── 004-fulfillment (leaf)
```

**Why flat physical structure?**
- ✅ Simple paths: `specs/domain/013-credit-card-payment/`
- ✅ FEATURE independence: Each specification is a standalone FEATURE
- ✅ Flexible numbering: 003's children can be 013-015 (skip 004-012)
- ✅ Git branch friendly: Branch name = directory name
- ✅ Easy reorganization: Change parent in frontmatter, no file moves

**Key features**:
- **Any specification can be a parent**: If complex, run plan → tasks → implement to create sub-specifications
- **Unlimited depth**: Sub-specifications can have their own sub-specifications
- **Context tracking**: Via YAML frontmatter (spec_id, parent, root, type)
- **Unified commands**: Same commands work at all levels

**How relationships are maintained**:
- **Physical**: All specifications are sibling directories under `specs/domain/`
- **Logical**: Parent-child relationships declared in YAML frontmatter
  ```yaml
  ---
  spec_id: 013-credit-card-payment
  parent: 003-payment-processing    # ← Declares logical parent
  root: 001-order-specification
  type: leaf
  ---
  ```
- **Parent → Child**: Parent's `spec.md` lists sub-specifications in "Sub-Specifications" table
- **Child → Parent**: Child's `spec.md` shows "Parent chain" breadcrumb navigation
- **Benefit**: Change relationships by editing frontmatter, no directory restructuring needed

**Example workflow** (Level 2 splitting):
```bash
# At root (001)
/metaspec.sds.specify → 001-order-specification/spec.md
/metaspec.sds.plan → Decides to split
/metaspec.sds.implement → Creates 002-008

# At level 2 (003 is also complex)
cd specs/domain/003-payment-processing/
/metaspec.sds.plan → Decides to split again
/metaspec.sds.implement → Creates 013-015
```

**Numbering strategy**:
- Root specification starts at 001
- First-level children: 002-009 (reserve 001 for root)
- Second-level children: 010-099 (e.g., 003's children are 013-015)
- Third-level children: 100-999
- Benefits: Clear hierarchy, flexible expansion, easy identification

**See [Recommended Practice: SDS + SDD Separation](#recommended-practice-sds--sdd-separation) for specification + toolkit separation.**

---

#### ⚠️ CRITICAL PRINCIPLE: Specification First, Toolkit Second

**Every speckit MUST have a domain specification before toolkit development.**

Why this matters:
- **Specification** = WHAT (domain specification, core asset)
- **Toolkit** = HOW (implementation, supporting tool)
- Without specification, MetaSpec becomes a generic code generator
- **Spec-Driven** means specifications drive development

**Workflow**:
1. ✅ First: Define specification with `/metaspec.sds.specify`
2. ✅ Then: Develop toolkit with `/metaspec.sdd.specify`
3. ❌ Never: Skip specification and go straight to toolkit

**Enforcement**:
- `/metaspec.sdd.specify` will ERROR if no specification exists
- `/metaspec.sdd.analyze` marks missing specification as CRITICAL
- Toolkit specs MUST have Dependencies section referencing specification

---

### 🎯 How Toolkit Value is Realized

**Toolkit value ≠ Fixed code templates**  
**Toolkit value = Spec-driven code generation**

MetaSpec generates **working toolkits** through a three-stage process:

#### Stage 1: Define Specification (SDS)
```
/metaspec.sds.specify
  ↓
specs/domain/001-{domain}-specification/spec.md
  - Entity definitions
  - Validation rules
  - Operations
  - Error handling
```

#### Stage 2: Define Toolkit (SDD)
```
/metaspec.sdd.specify
  ↓
AI guides you to define:
  - Implementation Language: Python / TypeScript / Go / Rust / Other
  - Required Components: Parser / Validator / CLI / Generator / SDK
  - Architecture: Monolithic / Modular / Plugin-based
  ↓
specs/toolkit/001-{name}/spec.md
  - Language choice + rationale
  - Component selection
  - Architecture direction
  - Dependencies on specification
```

#### Stage 3: Generate Code (SDD)
```
/metaspec.sdd.plan
  ↓
AI designs architecture based on:
  - Chosen language (Python/TS/Go/Rust)
  - Required components
  - Specification entities
  ↓
specs/toolkit/001-{name}/plan.md
  - Tech stack for chosen language
  - File structure
  - Component interfaces
  
/metaspec.sdd.implement
  ↓
AI generates code based on:
  - Specification (entity definitions)
  - Toolkit spec (language, components)
  - Plan (architecture, structure)
  ↓
src/{package_name}/
  - models.py/ts/go (from specification entities)
  - parser.py/ts/go (from toolkit spec)
  - validator.py/ts/go (enforces specification rules)
  - cli.py/ts/go (toolkit commands)
```

**Key advantages**:
- ✅ **Language-agnostic**: Supports Python, TypeScript, Go, Rust
- ✅ **Component-flexible**: Generate only what's needed
- ✅ **Architecture-adaptive**: Monolithic, modular, or plugin-based
- ✅ **Spec-driven**: Code generated from specifications, not templates
- ✅ **Specification-compliant**: Generated code enforces specification rules

**Example outcome**:
```bash
$ cd my-speckit
$ /metaspec.sds.specify  # Define domain specification
$ /metaspec.sdd.specify  # Choose Python, Parser+Validator+CLI
$ /metaspec.sdd.plan     # Design Python architecture
$ /metaspec.sdd.implement # Generate code
$ pip install -e .
$ my-speckit --help      # ✅ Working CLI!
$ my-speckit validate spec.yaml  # ✅ Validates against specification!
```

This is how MetaSpec realizes Toolkit value: **not by providing fixed templates, but by generating spec-driven, language-appropriate, working code**.

#### SDD (Spec-Driven Development) - 8 Commands
For developing speckits (spec-driven toolkits):

- `/metaspec.sdd.constitution` - Update Part III of constitution (Toolkit Implementation Principles)
- `/metaspec.sdd.specify` - Define toolkit specifications
- `/metaspec.sdd.clarify` - Clarify technical decisions (recommended BEFORE plan; input quality gate)
- `/metaspec.sdd.plan` - Plan toolkit implementation architecture
- `/metaspec.sdd.checklist` - Validate requirements completeness (recommended AFTER plan; quality gate)
- `/metaspec.sdd.tasks` - Break down implementation work
- `/metaspec.sdd.analyze` - Check architecture consistency (recommended AFTER tasks, BEFORE implement; checkpoint)
- `/metaspec.sdd.implement` - Build toolkit code (write actual implementation)

**Workflow**: Follows [spec-kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit) pattern completely (toolkit development always needs full process)
```
constitution → specify → [clarify] → plan → [checklist] → tasks → [analyze] → implement
```

**Location**: Works with `specs/toolkit/` directory
**Constitution**: Updates Part III in `/memory/constitution.md`

#### Evolution - 3 Shared Commands
For controlled specification evolution (both SDS and SDD):

- `/metaspec.proposal` - Propose changes with `--type sds|sdd` parameter
- `/metaspec.apply` - Apply approved changes
- `/metaspec.archive` - Archive completed changes

**Location**: Works with `changes/` directory (independent from specs/)

### The Relationship

```
MetaSpec commands (19 total):
  - SDS (8 commands)     → Define domain specifications (specs/domain/)
                         → Update constitution Part II
  - SDD (8 commands)     → Develop toolkits (specs/toolkit/)
                         → Update constitution Part III
  - Evolution (3 shared) → Manage changes (changes/)
                              ↓
                    Project structure:
                    ├── memory/
                    │   └── constitution.md  ← Unified constitution (3 parts)
                    ├── specs/
                    │   ├── domain/   ← SDS manages (domain specifications)
                    │   └── toolkit/  ← SDD manages (toolkit implementation)
                    └── changes/      ← Evolution manages (independent)
```

**Key principle**: 
- One unified constitution with three parts
- SDS and SDD each manage their respective sections
- Clear separation between domain specification and toolkit development

### When to Use Which

**Use SDS commands** (`/metaspec.sds.*`):
- Defining domain specifications from scratch
- Specifying specification entities, operations, validation rules
- Creating domain specifications independent of implementation
- Focus on WHAT the domain specification is

**Use SDD commands** (`/metaspec.sdd.*`):
- Developing spec-driven toolkits (always uses complete workflow like spec-kit)
- Planning and implementing parsers, validators, CLI
- Building tools to support a specification
- Focus on HOW to implement the toolkit
- Unlike SDS, toolkit development always needs full process (no "Simple Path")

**Use Evolution commands** (`/metaspec.*`):
- Specification is stable and in use (domain specification or toolkit)
- Changes need review or approval
- Want to track change history
- Controlled evolution for both SDS and SDD specs
- Use `--type sds` for specification changes, `--type sdd` for toolkit changes

**Typical workflow**:
1. **SDS**: Define domain specification
   - Simple: `/metaspec.sds.specify` → `/metaspec.sds.checklist`
   - Complex: `/metaspec.sds.specify` → `/metaspec.sds.plan` → `/metaspec.sds.tasks` → `/metaspec.sds.implement`
2. **SDD**: Develop toolkit (always complete workflow, like spec-kit)
   - `/metaspec.sdd.specify` → `/metaspec.sdd.clarify` → `/metaspec.sdd.plan` → `/metaspec.sdd.checklist` → `/metaspec.sdd.tasks` → `/metaspec.sdd.analyze` → `/metaspec.sdd.implement`
3. **Evolution**: Manage changes to either specification or toolkit
   - `/metaspec.proposal --type sds|sdd`

### Recommended Practice: SDS + SDD Separation

When using MetaSpec to develop a speckit, follow this two-phase approach:

#### Phase 1: Domain Specification (SDS)

**Purpose**: Define the domain specification, rules, and standards

**Location**: `specs/domain/001-{domain}-specification/`

**What to include**:
- Domain entities and schemas
- Validation rules and constraints
- Operations and interfaces
- Error handling specifications

**Example**:
```markdown
# specs/domain/001-mcp-core-specification/spec.md

## MCP Specification

### Server Interface
- initialize: Server startup handshake
- tools/list: Enumerate available tools
- tools/call: Execute a specific tool

### Validation Rules
- Tool name must be unique
- inputSchema must be valid JSON Schema
```

**Key principle**: This is pure domain knowledge, independent of any speckit implementation.

#### Phase 2: Toolkit Specification (SDD)

**Purpose**: Define how to build tools to parse, validate, and enforce the specification

**Location**: `specs/toolkit/001-{name}/`

**What to include**:
- Explicit dependency on domain specifications
- **User Journey Analysis** (🆕 From Step 2.5)
  - Primary users (AI Agents vs Human Developers distribution)
  - Key usage scenarios (3-5 scenarios with User/Context/Goal/Pain Point)
  - Feature derivation from scenarios (P0/P1/P2 priority matrix)
  - Command design rationale (why each command exists)
  - Scenario coverage matrix
- Parser design (input formats)
- Validator logic (references specification rules)
- CLI commands (init, validate, generate)
- **Slash Commands** (for AI agents)
- **Templates & Examples** (🆕 From Component 6)
  - Templates directory structure (organized by specification system source)
  - Template mapping (library specs → directories)
  - Entity templates (specification entities → template files)
  - Examples directory (basic/advanced/use-cases)
  - Implementation checklist
- Success criteria

**Example**:
```markdown
# specs/toolkit/001-mcp-parser/spec.md

## Dependencies
- Depends on: domain/001-mcp-core-spec

## User Journey Analysis
### Primary Users
- 80% AI Agents (Claude in Cursor)
- 20% Human Developers

### Key Scenarios
**Scenario 1**: AI Agent generates MCP server from natural language
- User: AI Agent
- Goal: Generate valid server definition
- Required Features: show-spec command, get-template command, validate CLI

**Scenario 2**: Developer validates server definition manually
- User: Human Developer
- Goal: Verify server compliance
- Required Features: init, validate, docs

### Derived Features (P0)
- Specification reference system: AI needs rules before generating (Scenarios: 1)
- Template system: Users need starting points (Scenarios: 1, 2)
- Validation CLI: Critical for both AI and developers (All scenarios)

### Command Design Rationale
- show-spec: AI needs rules before generating → Scenario 1
- validate: Critical for both AI and developers → All scenarios
- init: Developer quick setup → Scenario 2

## Components
1. Parser: Parse MCP server definitions
2. Validator: Verify compliance with specification
3. CLI: mcp-spec-kit init|validate|generate

## Templates & Examples
### Templates Directory Structure

```

**Key principle**: Toolkit specs explicitly depend on domain specifications, derive features from user scenarios, and define HOW to implement the toolkit.

#### MetaSpec Workflow for SDS + SDD

**SDS has two workflow paths** (like [GitHub spec-kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit)):

**Path 1: Simple Specification** (Recommended starting point)
- Use when: Single specification document, no need to split

```bash
# Core Flow (Required)
/metaspec.sds.constitution  # 1. Define specification design principles
/metaspec.sds.specify       # 2. Create specs/domain/001-{domain}-specification/spec.md

# Quality Gates (Recommended)
/metaspec.sds.clarify       # 3. Clarify ambiguities (input quality gate)
/metaspec.sds.checklist     # 4. Final quality validation (output quality gate)
```

**Path 2: Complex Specification** (Needs splitting)
- Use when: Large specification requiring multiple sub-specifications

```bash
# Core Flow (Required)
/metaspec.sds.constitution  # 1. Define specification design principles
/metaspec.sds.specify       # 2. Create root specification

# Quality Gates (Recommended)
/metaspec.sds.clarify       # 3. Clarify ambiguities (BEFORE plan, input quality gate)

# Core Flow (Required) - Continued
/metaspec.sds.plan          # 4. Plan sub-specification architecture ⭐

# Quality Gates (Recommended)
/metaspec.sds.checklist     # 5. Validate requirements (AFTER plan, quality gate)

# Core Flow (Required) - Continued
/metaspec.sds.tasks         # 6. Break down specification tasks ⭐

# Quality Gates (Recommended)
/metaspec.sds.analyze       # 7. Check task consistency (AFTER tasks, checkpoint)

# Core Flow (Required) - Continued
/metaspec.sds.implement     # 8. Write sub-specification documents (NOT code) ⭐
```

📌 **How to choose**: Start with Path 1. If `/metaspec.sds.specify` output shows complexity, run `/metaspec.sds.plan` to decide if splitting is needed. If yes, switch to Path 2.

# Phase 2: Toolkit Specification (SDD)
/metaspec.sdd.constitution  # Define toolkit principles
/metaspec.sdd.specify       # Create specs/toolkit/001-parser/spec.md
                           # Must reference: domain/001-{domain}-spec
/metaspec.sdd.plan          # Plan toolkit architecture
/metaspec.sdd.tasks         # Break down implementation
/metaspec.sdd.implement     # Build src/ code based on toolkit spec
/metaspec.sdd.checklist     # Validate quality
/metaspec.sdd.analyze       # Verify toolkit references specification correctly

# Evolution: Manage Changes
/metaspec.proposal "Add GraphQL" --type sds    # Propose specification change
/metaspec.apply add-graphql                     # Apply approved change
/metaspec.archive add-graphql                   # Archive completed change
```

#### Why Separate?

1. **Clear separation of concerns**
   - Specification experts define WHAT (SDS)
   - Toolkit experts define HOW (SDD)

2. **Reusable specifications**
   - Domain specifications can be published independently
   - Other tools can reference the same specification

3. **Clean dependencies**
   - Toolkit explicitly depends on specification
   - `/metaspec.sdd.analyze` can verify consistency

4. **Embodies MetaSpec philosophy**
   - Domain specification is the source of truth
   - Toolkit is the carrier

#### When to Use

**Use SDS + SDD Separation** (Recommended):
- Domain has well-defined specifications (MCP, OpenAPI, GraphQL)
- Domain specification can be useful independently
- Multiple toolkit implementations might exist

**Merge SDS and SDD** (Acceptable for simple cases):
- Very simple domain without formal specifications
- Toolkit is the only implementation
- No need for standalone domain specification

### Practical Examples

**Example 1: Starting a new speckit (Simple Specification)**
```bash
cd my-speckit
# Phase 1: Define specification (Simple Path)
/metaspec.sds.constitution  # Define specification design principles
/metaspec.sds.specify "Define domain specification"  # Create specification
/metaspec.sds.clarify  # Clarify ambiguities (recommended)
/metaspec.sds.checklist  # Quality check (recommended)

# Phase 2: Develop toolkit (complete workflow)
/metaspec.sdd.constitution  # Define toolkit principles
/metaspec.sdd.specify "Define parser and validator"  # Toolkit spec
/metaspec.sdd.clarify  # Clarify technical decisions (recommended)
/metaspec.sdd.plan  # Plan architecture
/metaspec.sdd.checklist  # Validate requirements (recommended)
/metaspec.sdd.tasks  # Break down implementation
/metaspec.sdd.analyze  # Check architecture consistency (recommended)
/metaspec.sdd.implement  # Write code
```

**Example 1b: Complex Specification (Needs Splitting)**
```bash
cd my-speckit
# Phase 1: Define specification (Complex Path)
/metaspec.sds.constitution  # Define specification design principles
/metaspec.sds.specify "Define MCP specification"  # Create root specification
/metaspec.sds.clarify  # Clarify ambiguities (BEFORE plan)
/metaspec.sds.plan  # Plan sub-specification architecture
/metaspec.sds.checklist  # Validate requirements (AFTER plan)
/metaspec.sds.tasks  # Break down specification tasks
/metaspec.sds.analyze  # Check task consistency (BEFORE implement)
/metaspec.sds.implement  # Write sub-specification documents (NOT code)

# Phase 2: Develop toolkit (complete workflow, same as Example 1)
/metaspec.sdd.constitution
/metaspec.sdd.specify "Define parser and validator"
/metaspec.sdd.clarify
/metaspec.sdd.plan
/metaspec.sdd.checklist
/metaspec.sdd.tasks
/metaspec.sdd.analyze
/metaspec.sdd.implement
```

**Example 2: Iterating on specification**
```bash
# Make changes to specs/domain/001-*/spec.md
/metaspec.sds.clarify  # Resolve ambiguities
/metaspec.sds.checklist  # Validate specification quality
/metaspec.sds.analyze  # Check consistency
```

**Example 3: Implementing toolkit**
```bash
/metaspec.sdd.tasks  # Break down work
/metaspec.sdd.implement  # Execute tasks
/metaspec.sdd.checklist  # Validate quality
```

**Example 4: Controlled evolution**
```bash
# For stable specification or toolkit
/metaspec.proposal "Add GraphQL support" --type sds  # Specification change
# Review and approve
/metaspec.apply <proposal-id>
/metaspec.archive <proposal-id>
```

## 🧭 Token Optimization: Precision-Guided Navigation

**NEW in v0.5.4+**: Major MetaSpec commands now include **precision-guided navigation** with exact line numbers, enabling massive token savings (84-99%).

### What is Precision-Guided Navigation?

Instead of reading entire command files (1000-2300+ lines), AI can now jump directly to specific sections using `read_file` with `offset` and `limit` parameters.

**Example**:
```python
# ❌ Before: Read entire file
read_file("src/metaspec/templates/meta/sdd/commands/specify.md.j2")
# Result: 2378 lines (~8000 tokens)

# ✅ After: Read only CLI design section
read_file("src/metaspec/templates/meta/sdd/commands/specify.md.j2", offset=390, limit=273)
# Result: 273 lines (~900 tokens)
# Token savings: 88.3% 🎉
```

### Commands with Navigation

**Enhanced commands** (6 total, 8615 lines coverage):

| Command | Lines | Navigation Sections | Best Savings |
|---------|-------|---------------------|--------------|
| **SDD/specify** | 2378 | 7 main + 7 subsections | 70-94% |
| **SDS/implement** | 1271 | 6 main + 9 templates | 87-95% |
| **SDS/specify** | 1060 | 6 main + 8 templates | 70-90% |
| **SDS/tasks** | 1054 | 7 main + 5 templates + 4 phases | 84-99% |
| **SDD/implement** | 998 | 7 main + 4 languages + 5 phases | 84-97% |
| **SDD/plan** | 854 | 7 main + 4 languages + 4 components | 90-98% |

### How to Use Navigation

Each enhanced command starts with a **📖 Navigation Guide** table showing:
- **Line ranges** for each section
- **read_file usage** with exact offset/limit
- **Typical usage patterns** with concrete examples
- **Token savings** calculation

**Example from SDD/specify**:

```markdown
📖 Navigation Guide (Quick Reference with Line Numbers)

Core Flow:
| Step | Lines | Size | read_file Usage |
|------|-------|------|-----------------|
| 1. Setup | 55-111 | 56 lines | read_file(target_file, offset=55, limit=56) |
| 3. CLI Design | 390-663 | 273 lines | read_file(target_file, offset=390, limit=273) |

💡 Typical Usage Patterns:
# Minimal: Read only Steps 1-2 (135 lines)
read_file(target_file, offset=55, limit=135)

# CLI Design: Read Component 3 (273 lines)
read_file(target_file, offset=390, limit=273)
```

### Language-Specific Navigation (SDD)

**Special feature** for toolkit development: Jump directly to language-specific context.

```python
# Python toolkit development
read_file("implement.md.j2", offset=210, limit=25)  # 97% savings! 🏆

# TypeScript toolkit development
read_file("implement.md.j2", offset=236, limit=25)  # 97% savings! 🏆

# Go toolkit development
read_file("plan.md.j2", offset=132, limit=15)  # 98% savings! 🏆

# Rust toolkit development
read_file("plan.md.j2", offset=148, limit=16)  # 98% savings! 🏆
```

### Best Practices

**When to use navigation**:
1. ✅ You need specific guidance (e.g., CLI design, templates)
2. ✅ You're familiar with the command structure
3. ✅ You want to minimize token usage

**When to read full file**:
1. ⚠️ First time using the command (learn structure)
2. ⚠️ Need comprehensive understanding
3. ⚠️ Unclear which section you need

**Quick Reference Strategy**:
```python
# Step 1: Read navigation guide only (first 100 lines)
read_file(target_file, offset=1, limit=100)

# Step 2: Based on navigation, read specific section
read_file(target_file, offset=390, limit=273)

# Result: ~370 lines vs 2378 lines = 84% savings
```

### Token Savings by Scenario

**Real-world examples**:

| Scenario | Before | After | Savings |
|----------|--------|-------|---------|
| Quick start | 2378 lines | 135 lines | **94.2%** |
| CLI design | 2378 lines | 273 lines | **88.3%** |
| Template reference | 1054 lines | 11 lines | **99.0%** 🏆 |
| Language context | 854 lines | 16 lines | **98.1%** 🏆 |
| Operation template | 1271 lines | 45 lines | **96.5%** |

**Average token savings**: 88-98% in typical usage scenarios.

## 🔄 Using Commands with Iteration Support

**CRITICAL**: Validation/analysis commands (checklist, analyze, clarify) support **iteration modes** to preserve history and track progress.

### Understanding Iteration Modes

When you run a validation command and output already exists, you should ask the user which mode to use:

| Mode | Action | When to Use |
|------|--------|-------------|
| **update** (default) | Update scores/status, add Iteration N section | User says "re-run", "verify improvement", "check again" |
| **new** | Create new output (backup existing) | User says "start fresh", "regenerate" |
| **append** | Add supplementary output for different focus | User says "add another", "different aspect" |

### Default Interpretation Rules

**When user says**:
- ✅ "re-run checklist" → **update** mode
- ✅ "re-run analyze" → **update** mode
- ✅ "verify improvement" → **update** mode
- ✅ "check quality again" → **update** mode
- ⚠️ "start fresh" → **new** mode
- ⚠️ "regenerate checklist" → **new** mode
- 🔵 "add another checklist" → **append** mode

**Key principle**: Default to **update** mode unless user explicitly requests new/regenerate.

### Iteration Workflow Example

**Scenario**: User improves specification based on checklist feedback

```bash
# Step 1: Initial validation
User: "Run checklist to validate specification quality"
AI: /metaspec.sds.checklist

Output:
✅ Checklist generated: comprehensive-quality.md

📋 Summary:
- CHK001: ❌ Missing field types
- CHK002: ❌ No validation rules
- CHK003: ⚠️ Incomplete examples
Score: 33% (1/3 passing)

# Step 2: User fixes issues
User edits specs/domain/001-mcp/spec.md
- Adds field types
- Adds validation rules

# Step 3: Re-validate (CRITICAL MOMENT)
User: "Re-run checklist to verify improvements"

AI recognizes:
- ✅ Checklist file exists
- ✅ User says "re-run... verify improvements"
- ✅ This means: update mode (not regenerate)

AI: /metaspec.sds.checklist (update mode)

Output:
✅ Checklist updated: comprehensive-quality.md

📊 Iteration 2 Summary:
- Items updated: 3/3
- Improved: 2 items (CHK001: ❌ → ✅, CHK002: ❌ → ✅)
- Still partial: 1 item (CHK003: ⚠️)

📈 Progress:
- Previous: 33% (1/3 passing)
- Current: 67% (2/3 passing)
- Improvement: +34%

🎯 Key improvements:
- CHK001: ❌ → ✅ (field types now defined)
- CHK002: ❌ → ✅ (validation rules added)

⚠️ Still needs work:
- CHK003: Examples incomplete (2/5 entities)
```

### What Gets Preserved in Update Mode

**Preserved**:
- ✅ All previous iteration records (Iteration 1, 2, 3...)
- ✅ Original checklist item IDs (CHK001, CHK002...)
- ✅ Evidence and detailed findings
- ✅ Category structure
- ✅ Progress history

**Updated**:
- ✅ Pass/Partial/Missing status (❌ → ⚠️ → ✅)
- ✅ Evidence with new findings
- ✅ Overall scores and percentages

**Added**:
- ✅ New Iteration N section with date
- ✅ Progress comparison (before/after)
- ✅ List of improvements

### Best Practices for AI Agents

1. **Always check if output exists**
   ```bash
   Before running validation command:
   - Check: Does checklists/comprehensive-quality.md exist?
   - If YES: Ask user for mode (or infer from keywords)
   - If NO: Generate new
   ```

2. **Default to update mode**
   ```bash
   Unless user explicitly says "start fresh" or "regenerate":
   → Always choose update mode
   → This preserves valuable history
   ```

3. **Highlight improvements**
   ```bash
   In update mode, emphasize:
   - What improved: CHK001: ❌ → ✅
   - What's still needed: CHK003: ⚠️
   - Overall progress: +34%
   ```

4. **Never silently overwrite**
   ```bash
   ❌ WRONG: Detect existing file → Silently regenerate
   ✅ RIGHT: Detect existing file → Ask mode → Update with history
   ```

### When NOT to Use Iteration Modes

**Creation commands** (specify, implement, constitution):
- ❌ These create initial specs/code
- ❌ After creation, users edit directly
- ❌ No iteration tracking needed

**Execution commands** (tasks):
- ❌ These execute and mark complete
- ❌ Not validation-oriented
- ❌ Use Evolution for changes

### Evolution Layer vs Command Layer

**Command Layer** (checklist, analyze, clarify):
- Purpose: **Validate** specification quality (read-only)
- Output: checklists/quality.md, analysis/report.md
- Never modifies: spec.md
- Iteration: update/new/append modes

**Evolution Layer** (proposal, apply, archive):
- Purpose: **Modify** specifications (formal process)
- Output: changes/[id]/proposal.md, spec-delta.md
- Modifies: spec.md (after approval)
- When: Released toolkit OR breaking/major changes

See [Decision Guide](docs/evolution-guide.md) for when to use which.

## 📝 Complete Workflow: Generating a Speckit

This section describes **how to generate a speckit** using `metaspec init`.

**Note**: This is different from **developing a speckit** (which uses MetaSpec commands and [SDS + SDD Separation](#recommended-practice-sds--sdd-separation) practice).

### Two Workflows

| Workflow | Purpose | Commands |
|----------|---------|----------|
| **Generate Speckit** | Create initial speckit structure | `metaspec init` (this section) |
| **Develop Speckit** | Define specs and implement features | MetaSpec commands `/metaspec.*` |

Creating a speckit is more complex than building an application. Follow these steps carefully.

---

### **STEP 1: Understand Domain Requirements**

**Goal**: Research domain before designing.

**Key actions**:
1. Ask clarifying questions (domain, use case, users, existing tools)
2. Use `web_search` for standards and best practices
3. Identify key entities and relationships

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Domain thoroughly researched
- [ ] Key entities identified (1-3 core entities)
- [ ] Existing solutions studied
- [ ] Not assuming domain behavior

---

### **STEP 2: Design Entity Model**

**Goal**: Define core entities with minimal fields.

**Key principles**:
- Start minimal: 1-3 entities, 3-5 fields each
- Field types: `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `array`, `object`
- Only essential fields as `required: true`
- Every field needs a description

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Entities match domain research
- [ ] Field names clear and consistent
- [ ] Only essential fields required
- [ ] No over-engineering

---

### **STEP 3: Use Template or Interactive Mode**

**Recommended**: Use `metaspec init` with templates or interactive mode.

```bash
metaspec init                        # Interactive wizard
metaspec init my-toolkit             # Quick start (uses 'default')
metaspec init my-toolkit default     # Explicit (same as above)
```

**Required fields** (if manual):
- `name`, `version`, `domain`, `lifecycle`, `description`
- Entity definition (from STEP 2)
- Commands (init, validate, generate)
- Dependencies (pydantic, typer, yaml parser)

**Checklist**:
- [ ] All required fields filled
- [ ] Entity matches STEP 2 design
- [ ] Commands aligned with domain
- [ ] Dependencies specified

---

### **STEP 3.5: Understand init Command Standards** ⭐ NEW

**Goal**: Ensure your speckit's `init` command follows MetaSpec standards.

**Why this matters**: When you later use `/metaspec.sdd.specify` to define your toolkit, the `init` command specification must align with MetaSpec conventions. This prevents common mistakes like creating single files instead of project structures.

#### init Command Standard for Generator/Scaffolder Toolkits

**If your toolkit type is "Generator/Scaffolder"**, the `init` command **MUST**:

1. **Argument Format**:
   ```bash
   {toolkit-name} init <project-directory> [OPTIONS]
   ```
   - ✅ Argument is a **directory name** (not a filename)
   - ❌ WRONG: `{toolkit-name} init spec.yaml`
   - ✅ RIGHT: `{toolkit-name} init my-project`

2. **Output Structure** (Must create):
   ```
   <project-directory>/
   ├── .{toolkit-name}/       # Configuration directory
   │   ├── commands/          # (Optional) Custom slash commands
   │   └── templates/         # (Optional) Output templates
   ├── memory/
   │   └── constitution.md    # Project principles (pre-filled)
   ├── specs/
   │   └── {initial-spec}     # Initial specification file
   └── README.md              # Project documentation
   ```

3. **constitution.md Requirements**:
   - ✅ Must be pre-filled with template content
   - ✅ Must include domain-specific guidance
   - ❌ NOT empty or placeholder

4. **Initial Specification File**:
   - ✅ Created from template with example data
   - ✅ Must pass validation immediately

#### Reference Examples

**✅ Correct (MetaSpec itself)**:
```bash
metaspec init my-speckit
# Creates: my-speckit/ with full structure
# - All required directories
# - Pre-filled constitution.md
# - Example spec files
```

**❌ Wrong**:
```bash
my-toolkit init spec.yaml
# Creates: Single spec.yaml file only
# Missing: directories, constitution, README
```

#### Why These Standards?

1. **Consistency**: All MetaSpec-generated toolkits follow the same pattern
2. **AI-Friendly**: AI agents know what to expect
3. **Complete Projects**: Users get a full project structure, not just a file
4. **Best Practices**: Follows industry standards (like create-react-app, cargo new)

#### When NOT to Follow

**If your toolkit is NOT a "Generator/Scaffolder"** (e.g., pure validator, query tool), `init` may have different behavior or not exist at all. The standards above apply specifically to toolkits that create projects or scaffolding.

---

### **STEP 4: Preview with Dry-Run**

**Goal**: Test before generating.

```bash
metaspec init my-toolkit --dry-run
```

**Checklist**:
- [ ] File structure looks correct
- [ ] Entity names verified
- [ ] Dependencies confirmed
- [ ] No validation errors

---

### **STEP 5: Generate Speckit**

**Goal**: Generate the complete speckit.

```bash
metaspec init my-speckit -o ./my-speckit
```

**Post-generation**:
1. Verify files created successfully
2. Run init script if exists: `./scripts/init.sh`
3. Read generated README.md and AGENTS.md

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Generation completed without errors
- [ ] All expected files present
- [ ] README and AGENTS.md generated

---

### **STEP 6: Test the Speckit**

**Goal**: Verify speckit works.

```bash
cd my-speckit
pip install -e .
my-speckit --help
my-speckit init sample.yaml
my-speckit validate sample.yaml
```

**Checklist**:
- [ ] CLI commands work
- [ ] Help messages clear
- [ ] Sample spec validates
- [ ] Error messages helpful

---

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls

**Avoid these mistakes**:

1. **Over-Engineering** - Start with 1-3 entities, 3-5 fields each (not 20+ fields)
2. **Skipping Research** - Always use `web_search` to study domain standards
3. **No Dry-Run** - Always preview with `--dry-run` before generating
4. **Not Testing** - Test CLI commands after generation
5. **Ignoring Constitution** - Follow Minimal Viable Abstraction, AI-First Design, Progressive Enhancement

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

A successful speckit generation should:

- [ ] **Solves a real domain problem** - Not just a generic tool
- [ ] **Has clear entity model** - Entities match domain research
- [ ] **Follows minimal abstraction** - No over-engineering
- [ ] **Generates cleanly** - No errors during `metaspec init`
- [ ] **CLI works** - All commands functional
- [ ] **Has good docs** - README and AGENTS.md are clear
- [ ] **Includes constitution** - memory/constitution.md exists
- [ ] **Is testable** - Can create sample specs
- [ ] **Follows patterns** - Matches existing spec-driven tools

---

## 📚 Additional Resources

- **Template**: `templates/meta-spec-template.yaml`
- **Examples**: `examples/` directory
- **Constitution**: `memory/constitution.md`
- **Docs**: `docs/` directory
