# FastCov Development Guide

## What is this project?

FastCov is a Ruby gem with a native C extension that tracks which source files are executed during test runs. It's built for test impact analysis — figuring out which tests need to re-run when code changes. It hooks directly into the Ruby VM's event system rather than using Ruby's built-in `Coverage` module, which makes it significantly faster.

## Quick reference

```sh
bundle exec rake compile   # compile the C extension (required before tests)
bundle exec rake spec      # compile + run tests (--fail-fast)
bin/rspec                  # run tests via binstub
bin/benchmark              # run performance benchmarks
bin/benchmark --baseline   # save benchmark results as baseline for comparison
ITERATIONS=5000 bin/benchmark  # override iteration count
```

**Testing locally:** Always test in both Ruby 4.0 and Ruby 3.4.

**Before starting new changes:** Ask the user if they want to save a baseline benchmark first (`bin/benchmark --baseline`). This allows comparing performance before and after the changes.

## How the C extension works

The C extension defines `FastCov::Coverage` (a Ruby class) and `FastCov::Cache` (a Ruby module). Everything performance-sensitive lives in C.

### Two coverage mechanisms

**1. Line coverage** — The core feature. Hooks `RUBY_EVENT_LINE` which fires every time the Ruby VM executes a new line. The callback (`on_line_event`) records the source file path. It uses a pointer-caching optimization: `rb_sourcefile()` returns a `const char*` whose address doesn't change for the same file, so we compare pointers (a single integer comparison) instead of strings to skip files we've already seen.

**2. Allocation tracing** — Optional. Hooks `RUBY_INTERNAL_EVENT_NEWOBJ` which fires on every object allocation. We only care about `T_OBJECT` and `T_STRUCT` types (regular classes and structs). During `stop`, we iterate every class that was instantiated, walk its full ancestor chain (`rb_mod_ancestors`), and resolve each ancestor to its source file via `Object.const_source_location`. This catches classes that have no executable methods (empty models, structs, Data objects).

### In-memory cache

`Object.const_source_location` results are cached in a process-level Ruby Hash (`fast_cov_cache_hash`) and shared across all `FastCov::Coverage` instances. `FastCov::Cache.clear` resets it.

### GC integration

The C struct uses Ruby's TypedData API with proper `mark` and `free` callbacks. `rb_gc_mark` (non-movable, pins objects) is used for all VALUE fields — on Ruby 3.4+, `rb_gc_mark_movable` with compaction causes crashes, so we pin objects instead. The `klasses_table` (an `st_table`) stores raw VALUE pointers as keys, which are also marked via `rb_gc_mark`.

**Important for C code:** When storing raw `const char*` pointers from Ruby strings, freeze the string first (`rb_str_freeze`) to prevent GC compaction from moving it. Alternatively, re-read the pointer immediately before use with no intervening Ruby calls.

### Utils module

`FastCov::Utils` provides C-implemented utility functions:

- `path_within?(path, directory)` — Returns true if `path` is within `directory`. Correctly handles trailing slashes and sibling directories with longer names (e.g., `/a/b/c` does NOT match `/a/b/cd`).
- `relativize_paths(hash, root)` — Mutates `hash` in place, converting absolute path keys to relative paths from `root`. Called automatically by `FastCov.stop`.

## Benchmark scenarios

The benchmarks in `lib/fast_cov/benchmark/scenarios.rb` measure distinct aspects of the system. When adding new features or optimizing, run `bin/benchmark` before and after to check for regressions.

| Scenario | What it measures |
|---|---|
| Line coverage (small) | Overhead of start/stop + tracking a few files via line events |
| Line coverage (many files) | Same but exercising all fixture files (calculator, models, structs, dynamic dispatch) |
| Line coverage (single-threaded) | Per-thread hook mode (`threads: false`) vs global hook |
| Line coverage (with ignored_path) | Overhead of ignored_path filtering in the hot path |
| Allocation tracing | Overhead of NEWOBJ hooks + ancestor chain resolution at stop time |
| Rapid start/stop (100x) | Hook install/remove overhead across many cycles |
| Multi-threaded coverage | Thread creation + global hook overhead |

The runner takes 5 samples per scenario and reports the **median** to filter outliers. GC is run between samples. Default is 1000 iterations per sample.

## Testing conventions

- Tests are integration-level, organized by feature under `spec/lib/fast_cov/coverage/`.
- Shared context `"coverage instance"` (in `spec/support/shared_contexts.rb`) provides a standard `subject` with configurable `root`, `ignored_path`, `threading_mode`, and `allocation_tracing`.
- `fixtures_path(*segments)` helper builds absolute paths to `spec/fixtures/`.
- `FastCov::Cache.clear` runs before every test for isolation.
- Always use `--fail-fast` when running specs.

## Key design decisions

- **C over Ruby for the hot path.** Line event callbacks fire on every line of Ruby execution. Even small overhead per call multiplies across millions of events. The C extension avoids Ruby method dispatch, object allocation, and GC pressure in the callback.
- **Pointer caching for filename dedup.** `rb_sourcefile()` returns the same pointer for the same file. Comparing a pointer (one CPU instruction) is much faster than comparing strings.
- **Post-processing at stop time.** Allocation tracing processing happens in `stop`, not during execution. This keeps the hot path (line events) as lean as possible.
- **Process-level cache.** `const_source_location` results are cached globally and shared across Coverage instances.
- **No disk cache (for now).** The in-memory cache is sufficient for single test suite runs. Disk persistence was built and removed — it can be added back when needed.
- **Ruby 3.4+ only.** No version-conditional code. `GC.compact` and `Data.define` are available unconditionally.

## Releasing

- **Always ask before releasing a new version.** Do not bump version or create releases without explicit user approval.
- **Release names should be `vX.Y.Z`** — no extra words or descriptions in the release title.
