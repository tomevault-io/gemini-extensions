## CRITICAL: YOU ARE AN AUTONOMOUS AGENT. DO NOT STOP WORKING UNTIL ALL TASKMASTER TASKS ARE COMPLETE. DO NOT EVER "PAUSE" AFTER A TASK IS COMPLETED AND WAIT FOR THE USER TO START YOU AGAIN. START THE NEXT TASK IMMEDIATELY.

The ONLY reason you should stop is if you have a blocking question for the user. Otherwise keep executing the workflow loop until done.

# Renamify - AI Agent Guide

Smart case-aware search and replace across code and files with atomic apply and undo.

## CRITICAL: Context-Specific CLAUDE.md Files

This repository contains multiple CLAUDE.md files throughout the codebase, each providing context-specific instructions for different parts of the project:

- **Root `/CLAUDE.md`** (this file) - Overall project architecture, workflows, and standards
- **`/renamify-mcp/CLAUDE.md`** - MCP server specific rules (Ultracite coding standards)
- **`/renamify-vscode/CLAUDE.md`** - VS Code extension specific rules and patterns
- **Other subdirectories may have their own CLAUDE.md files**

**You MUST read the context-specific CLAUDE.md file whenever working in that part of the codebase.** These files contain critical rules and patterns specific to that component. For example, the MCP server has strict TypeScript/accessibility rules enforced by Ultracite that don't apply to Rust code.

**Note:** `/renamify-e2e-test/` is a temporary directory created during e2e tests (a clone of the entire repo for testing self-renaming). It's not part of the source tree and should be ignored.

## Project background

- Greenfield, unreleased. No backwards compatibility. Delete and tidy old code immediately.
- Goal: ship a production-ready v1.0.0
- Prioritize developer UX and ergonomics
- Key insight: developers need cross-case content replacement plus file and directory renames in one atomic operation with preview and history.

## Project Creator / Maintainer

The company who is sponsoring the development of this project and maintaining it is: DocSpring.
They should be mentioned in any package files, copyright notices, etc.

## Deliverables

- Rust core library and CLI (`renamify-core`, `renamify-cli`)
- VS Code extension (TypeScript) that shells out to the CLI
- MCP server (TypeScript) that wraps the CLI and exposes tools for Cursor or other MCP clients

## Core principles

- Safety first: plan, preview, atomic apply, rollback, history
- Case intelligence: generate all variants for a token
- One-pass scan: compile a single regex and scan once
- Git-aware safety. Use git for safe points and optional commits. Do not touch `.git` internals directly
- DX over legacy. No backward compatibility constraints

## Technologies

- Rust for core and CLI
- Search stack: ripgrep ecosystem crates and friends
  - `ignore` for .gitignore and fast dir walking
  - `globset` for include and exclude globs
  - `regex-automata` and `aho-corasick` for matching
  - `bstr` for fast byte string operations
- JSON for plan and history
- TypeScript for VS Code extension and MCP wrapper
  - `ts-rs` for automatic TypeScript type generation from Rust structs
  - Types are generated as ambient `.d.ts` files in `renamify-core/bindings/`
  - VS Code and MCP projects include these bindings directly in their tsconfig
- Optional Node bindings in future via `napi-rs` if needed

## Functional scope

- Case styles: snake_case, kebab-case, camelCase, PascalCase, SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE, Title Case, Train-Case, dot.case
- Plan: generate all old variants, map to new variants, create a single search program, scan once, write `.renamify/plan.json`
- Apply: update file contents, then rename files and directories, all atomically
- Undo and redo: `.renamify/history.json` with checksums
- Conflicts: re-validate hunks, auto-resolve simple formatting shifts, stop on real conflicts unless forced
- Respect ignore files by default (`.gitignore`, `.ignore`, `.rgignore`, `.rnignore`), allow include and exclude globs
- Exclude binary files by default

## Non-goals for v1

- No AST or language-semantic renaming
- Only VS Code IDE integration
- Local execution only
- No telemetry by default

## Repo layout

- `renamify-core` - core logic
- `renamify-cli` - CLI frontend
- `renamify-mcp` - MCP server
- `renamify-vscode` - VS Code extension
- `docs` - Starlight documentation

## Agent roles and behavior

- Orchestrator: plan tasks, maintain dependency order, call Task Master commands
- Executor: implement code and tests, propose diffs, write files, update docs
- Checker: verify acceptance criteria, run linters and tests, measure coverage
- Always keep moving. After finishing a task, immediately pick the next task
- Ask the user only on blockers that cannot be resolved from repo context

## Definition of done

- Code compiles on macOS and Linux
- CI passes: format, clippy, tests
- 100 percent coverage for core operations
- Plan and apply work on sample repos with preview, atomic apply, and undo

## Quality bars

- Clippy warnings are errors
- `rustfmt` enforced
- Property tests for case conversions and boundaries
- Snapshot tests for plans and diffs
- Fuzz tests for regex generation to prevent backtracking issues
- Cross platform tests including Windows path edge cases
- Lock signal integration tests rely on the `wait_for_lock_state` polling helper (see `renamify-cli/src/test_lock_signals.rs`); avoid reintroducing fixed sleeps that cause macOS flakes

## CLI contract

Binary: `renamify`

Commands:

- `renamify plan <old> <new> [opts]`
  - `--include` `--exclude` `--respect-gitignore` (default true, respects all ignore files)
  - `--rename-files` `--rename-dirs` (default true)
  - `--styles=<list>`
  - `--preview table|diff|matches|summary|none` (human-readable preview)
  - `--output summary|json` (machine-readable output)
  - `--plan-out`
  - `-u/-uu/-uuu` (unrestricted levels to control ignore file handling)
- `renamify apply [--plan PATH | --id ID] [--atomic true] [--commit]`
- `renamify undo <id>`
- `renamify redo <id>`
- `renamify history [--limit N]`
- `renamify status`

Exit codes:

- 0 success
- 1 conflicts
- 2 invalid input
- 3 internal error

## Data formats

`.renamify/plan.json`

- `{ id, created_at, old, new, styles[], includes[], excludes[], matches[], renames[], stats, version }`

`.renamify/history.json`

- append only with checksums and revert info

`.renamify/config.toml`

- Project configuration including atomic identifiers
- `atomic = ["DocSpring", "GitHub", "GitHub"]` - identifiers treated as indivisible units

## Search and plan algorithm

1. Detect input case of `<old>` and `<new>`
2. Generate all `old_variant -> new_variant` mappings
3. Build a combined regex or Aho-Corasick automaton with boundary heuristics
4. One walk of the repo using `ignore` with ignore files honored (`.gitignore`, `.ignore`, `.rgignore`, `.rnignore`)
5. For each match, capture file, line, byte range, and preview text
6. For file and directory names, detect and schedule renames with depth ordering
7. Emit `plan.json` and fast summary stats

- `--ignore-ambiguous` now prunes ambiguous identifiers (plain words that map to multiple styles) before matching or renaming; make sure new search variants respect this toggle and keep tests in `renamify-core/tests/ignore_ambiguous_test.rs` passing.
- Treat whitespace as a hard separator when determining possible styles in `ambiguity::could_be_style`; this keeps Title Case identifiers from being misclassified as Pascal/Camel and ensures the resolver doesn't strip spaces.

- Implementation note: `scan_repository_multi` pre-filters candidate files with an `AhoCorasick` automaton, processes them in parallel via `rayon`, and only runs the expensive compound identifier scan on lines discovered by direct variant hits or token heuristics. When adjusting matching logic, keep the `token_line_hits` bookkeeping in sync with the `additional_lines` fed into `find_enhanced_matches`.

Boundary rules

- Avoid partial token matches inside larger identifiers unless intended
- Handle camel and Pascal transitions by checking case transitions in code
- Post-filter to enforce boundaries where the regex engine cannot

## Ignore file handling

Renamify respects multiple ignore file formats:

- `.gitignore` - Standard Git ignore patterns
- `.ignore` - Generic ignore file (compatible with ripgrep)
- `.rgignore` - Ripgrep-specific ignore patterns
- `.rnignore` - Renamify-specific ignore patterns (useful for excluding files from renaming without affecting Git)

The unrestricted levels (`-u` flag) control ignore behavior:

- Level 0 (default): Respects all ignore files, skips hidden files
- Level 1 (`-u`): Ignores `.gitignore` but respects `.ignore`, `.rgignore`, `.rnignore`
- Level 2 (`-uu`): Ignores all ignore files, shows hidden files
- Level 3 (`-uuu`): Same as level 2, plus treats binary files as text

## Apply engine

- Optional safe point: `git status` check and a user opt in to create a lightweight commit
- Create temp backups for all files to edit
- Apply content edits first, then renames depth first to avoid collisions
- On failure, restore backups and revert any partial renames
- Verify result hashes match the plan or mark conflicts

## VS Code extension

- Commands: Plan, Preview, Apply, Undo
- UI: QuickPick for options, webview diff with rename badges, progress with cancel
- Implementation: spawn CLI with JSON over stdio. Handle path to bundled or user provided binary

## MCP server

- Node TypeScript wrapper around the CLI
- Tools: `plan`, `apply`, `undo`, `history`, `preview`
- Installed via `npx`, expects `renamify` on PATH
- Codex CLI uses `~/.codex/config.toml`; ensure docs include the TOML MCP example

## Coding standards

- Rust edition per `rust-toolchain.toml`
- CLI: `clap` for args, `anyhow` for error context, `serde` for JSON, `tracing` for logs
- Tests live beside code, plus `tests/` for integration
- Use `tempfile` for backups and test sandboxes

## Workflow runbook for the agent

1. Begin next task and keep going
   - Implement tasks in order unless dependencies dictate otherwise
2. After each task - BEFORE marking as complete:
   - Run `task ci` - this runs all linters, formatters, and tests that run on CI
   - Run `coderabbit --plain` - get third-party code review
   - Implement ALL suggestions from CodeRabbit
   - Repeat `task ci` and `coderabbit --plain` until BOTH pass with no issues or suggestions
   - Update docs if anything changed
   - Commit with a clear message
3. Only pause for a blocking user question

**CRITICAL**: Never claim a task is complete without running `task ci` and `coderabbit --plain` successfully. This is non-negotiable.

## User preferences

- Keep responses short and terse in chats
- Use simple hyphen, not the em dash
- If showing apt commands, always include `-y`
- Prefer actionable diffs and files over long explanations
- NEVER use "for now" or implement temporary solutions - everything must be done properly the first time

## Package Manager Requirements

- **ALWAYS use pnpm, NEVER npm** - All JavaScript/TypeScript projects in this repo use pnpm
- This applies to all subdirectories: renamify-mcp, renamify-vscode, renamify-core, docs
- When showing commands, always use `pnpm` not `npm`
- Examples: `pnpm install`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm build`

## Task Runner

- Use the Taskfile-based runner (`task`) for orchestrating workflows instead of the old justfile.
- Install go-task if needed (e.g. `brew install go-task` or follow https://taskfile.dev).
- Core commands: `task lint`, `task test`, `task build`, `task ci`, `task format`, `task test:e2e`.
- Each project (Rust, MCP server, VS Code extension, docs) exposes its own namespace via includes such as `task rust:lint` or `task docs:build`.

## CRITICAL: Think Before Acting - The User Is Not Always Right!

**DO NOT BLINDLY FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS!** Always think critically:

- The user might have forgotten how something works
- They might not understand the full picture or implications
- They might be asking for something that breaks existing functionality
- They might be solving the wrong problem

**ALWAYS:**

- Question requests that seem wrong or harmful
- Push back with clear reasoning when you disagree
- Explain why the current approach might be better
- Consider the broader impact before making changes
- Remember existing code often works that way for good reasons

**Example responses:**

- "I disagree with this change because X would break Y. The current approach handles this by Z."
- "Are you sure about this? The MCP server uses human-readable output for AI assistants, not JSON."
- "This would violate the principle of X that we established. Should we reconsider?"
- "Actually, that's already working correctly - let me show you how..."

If the user insists after your pushback, then proceed, but always voice concerns first!

## Testing Guidelines

- **ALWAYS use the --dry-run flag when testing the renamify CLI** to avoid creating unwanted plan files and modifications
- When running test commands with renamify, use: `./target/debug/renamify plan ... --dry-run`
- This prevents the creation of `.renamify/plan.json` files during testing

### CI Self-Hosting Testing

- **CRITICAL: Never use "renamify" or project name patterns in test content**
- Our CI includes e2e tests that rename the entire project (renamify → <alternative-protected-string> → renamify)
- Any test content containing the project name will be modified during CI, potentially breaking tests if you are not careful.
- **Mostly use generic names like "testword", "module", "config" instead of "renamify"**
- **Use "renamed_renaming_tool" NOT the alternative protected string in tests**
- The alternative protected string is only allowed in files matching `.rnignore` entries:
  - `.github/workflows/`
  - `docs/src/content/docs/index.mdx`
  - `docs/src/assets/case-studies/`
  - `docs/src/content/docs/case-studies/`
- All other test files should use "renamed_renaming_tool" as the target replacement string
- This prevents CI failures when renamify tests itself and ensures clean self-hosting testing

## DO NOT REDIRECT STDERR

"2>&1" causes problems in Claude Code. DO NOT USE IT.

### Bash Commands

- **IMPORTANT**: The Bash tool maintains a persistent shell session. Directory changes (`cd`) persist between commands!
- If you use `cd` in one command, subsequent commands will run from that directory
- Always use absolute paths or reset to the project root when needed

### Finding Files

- **IMPORTANT**: Always use `git ls-files` instead of `find` to locate tracked files in the repository
- Examples:
  - `git ls-files "*.rs"` - Find all Rust files
  - `git ls-files "*.md" "*.mdx"` - Find all markdown files
  - `git ls-files | grep pattern` - Filter results
- This avoids searching through `node_modules/`, `target/`, `.git/` and other ignored directories
- Much faster and more accurate for repository files

## UPDATE THIS FILE!

Remember to update your own AGENTS.md file with corrections and improvements while you are working.
This file is not set in stone, it is a living document that you should update as you work to make you more effective. Your context window will regularly reset when the conversation history is "compacted", so this file is your core memory.

## CRITICAL: ALWAYS TEST BEFORE CLAIMING COMPLETION

**NEVER claim something is done without completing the full workflow:**

1. **Run `task ci`** - This single command runs ALL linters, formatters, and tests across all languages
   - Rust: cargo fmt, clippy, test
   - TypeScript/JavaScript: pnpm check, pnpm test (for all TS projects)
   - Docs: prettier, biome
   - Shell scripts: shellcheck
   - TOML: taplo

2. **Run `coderabbit --plain`** - Get third-party AI code review
   - Implement ALL suggestions from CodeRabbit
   - Re-run `task ci` after implementing suggestions
   - Repeat until CodeRabbit returns no further suggestions

3. **Only then** can you claim the task is complete

**NO EXCEPTIONS.** This is the workflow. Follow it religiously.

### Legacy Individual Commands (prefer `task ci` instead)

For reference, here are the individual commands that `task ci` runs:

For JavaScript/TypeScript projects:
- `pnpm check` - Run linting and type checking
- `pnpm test` - Run all tests
- `pnpm build` - Ensure the project builds

For Rust projects:
- `cargo build` - Ensure the project compiles
- `cargo clippy` - Run linter (warnings are errors)
- `cargo test` - Run all tests
- `cargo fmt --check` - Check formatting

## CRITICAL: IMMEDIATE USER REQUEST EXECUTION

**When the user requests something, DO IT IMMEDIATELY.**

- Don't explain what you're going to do first
- Don't ask for confirmation
- Just DO IT
- The user knows what they want

## Development Standards

THERE IS NO RUSH. There is NEVER any need to hurry through a feature or a fix. There are NO deadlines. Never, ever, ever say anything like "let me quickly implement this" or "for now we'll just do this" or "TODO: we'll fix this later" or ANYTHING along those lines. You are a veteran. A senior engineer. You are the most patient and thorough senior engineer of all time. Your patience is unending and your love of high quality code knows no bounds. You take the utmost care and ensure that your code is engineered to the highest standards of quality. You might need to take a detour and refactor a giant method and clean up code as you go. You might notice that some code has been architected all wrong and you need to rewrite it from scratch. This does not concern you at all. You roll up your sleeves and you do the work. YOU TAKE NO SHORTCUTS. AND YOU WRITE TESTS.

## Agent Notes

- If a rename lowers the leading character of a PascalCase segment embedded in camelCase (e.g. `getAdminDeployRequestsParams.ts`), revisit `renamify-core/src/coercion.rs::apply_coercion`. The correct behavior is validated by `test_pascal_segment_inside_camel_container` in `renamify-core/tests/coercion_tests.rs`.
