## Provider Architecture

Crate uses gRPC to communicate with music metadata providers. The Docker image ships with MusicBrainz and Deezer providers as child processes managed by the main crate binary.

```
crate (main process)
  ├── Provider Manager (routes requests, caches, enriches)
  │   ├── gRPC → provider-musicbrainz (port 50051, 1 req/s rate limit)
  │   ├── gRPC → provider-deezer (port 50052, 10 req/s rate limit)
  │   └── gRPC → any external provider
  ├── Scheduler (new release detection via entity's stored provider)
  ├── Downloader (slskd integration)
  └── HTTP API (provider-unaware frontend)
```

Key concepts:
- **Default provider**: used for search and browse (configurable in settings, default: musicbrainz). Users can switch providers on the fly from the search UI.
- **Provider tracking**: each entity (artist/album/track) stores which provider+ID it came from
- **Orphan detection**: entities whose provider is unhealthy show as "orphaned" in the UI
- **Relink**: any entity can be relinked to a different provider at any time
- **Cache**: separate SQLite DB (cache.db) with configurable TTL, clearable from settings

Provider config format: `CRATE_PROVIDERS=name:binary:port,name2:binary2:port2`
For external providers: `CRATE_PROVIDERS=spotify:external:192.168.1.10:50053`

## Data flow

1. User searches for an artist (via selected provider's gRPC API, switchable on the fly)
2. User watches an artist (full discography), album, or individual track
3. Watched items saved to SQLite with provider + provider_id
4. Scheduler (configurable interval, default 6h) checks each watched artist's provider for new releases
5. Downloader processes queue: search slskd → pick best file → download → organize → tag
6. Track status: `wanted` → `downloading` → `owned`

## Download Retry, Blacklist & Shadow Bans

- **No results**: immediate fail, no retry. Track stays "wanted" for the scheduler's next cycle.
- **Transfer failures** (rejected, errored, cancelled): the (username, filename) pair is blacklisted in `slskd_blacklist` table. Future searches skip that source.
- **Stale transfers**: state-aware timeouts detect stalled downloads. InProgress/Initializing = 5min, Queued = 30min, Requested = 10min. Active transfer stalls blacklist the file; queued/requested stalls trigger a shadow ban on the user.
- **Shadow bans (cooldowns)**: temporary per-user blocks stored in `user_cooldowns` table. Triggered by stale queued transfers or StartDownload failures (e.g. user offline). Duration is configurable via `shadow_ban_duration_minutes` setting (default 60min). Expired cooldowns are auto-purged on the scheduler's daily integrity tick. `scoreCandidates` skips cooled-down users entirely.
- **Retry backoff**: 5m → 15m → 30m → 1h. After 4 attempts (~2h cumulative), permanently fails. Track reverts to "wanted".
- **Blacklist is per-file-per-user**: a user can be blacklisted for one file but not others. Shadow bans are per-user (all files blocked during cooldown).
- **API management**: `GET/DELETE /api/blacklist/{id}`, `GET/DELETE /api/cooldowns/{id}` for viewing and removing entries. Also exposed in the Settings UI under "Blocked Sources".

## Pagination

- Search API: `GET /api/search?q=...&limit=25&offset=0` returns `{artists: [...], total: N}`
- Activity API: `GET /api/activity?limit=50&offset=0` returns `{items: [...], total: N}`
- Frontend uses "Load More" buttons for both

## Scoring System

All file selection goes through `scoreCandidates()` in `internal/services/downloader/service.go`. Score components:

- **Quality (0-100)**: tier-based from user's priority list. Tier 0 = 100, Tier 1 = 75, Tier 2 = 50, etc. (min 25, gap of 25 per tier). If no tiers configured, uses fallback scoring. Fallback scores are capped below the lowest tier.
- **Artist bonus (+20)**: if artist name appears in filename. Kept below the tier gap (25) so quality always dominates between tiers.
- **Free slot bonus (+10)**: if user has a free upload slot (instant start).
- **Queue score (0-15)**: `15 / (1 + queueLength)`. Empty queue = 15, decays toward 0.

Design invariants (enforced by `TestScoringBalance`):
- Same availability → higher tier always wins
- Artist bonus alone cannot flip a tier (20 < 25 gap)
- All bonuses combined (max 45) can overcome one tier gap but not two (50)
- Fallback formats lose to configured tiers at equal availability

The `quality_fallback_enabled` setting (default true) controls whether files outside configured tiers are accepted at all.

## Quality Upgrades

- Priority-ordered quality tiers stored as JSON in settings (`quality_tiers`), default: FLAC > MP3 320 > MP3 256
- `download_format` and `download_bitrate` recorded on tracks at search time (when the slskd result is picked)
- Scheduler scans one artist per day (round-robin via `upgrade_last_artist_id` setting), re-queues owned tracks that can be upgraded to a higher-priority tier
- `QualityTierRank()` and `IsUpgradeable()` in `internal/services/downloader/` handle tier ranking

## Navidrome Integration

- Optional: configure `navidrome_url`, `navidrome_user`, `navidrome_password` in settings
- After each successful download+organize, triggers `startScan` via the Subsonic API
- Auth uses token+salt scheme: `token = md5(password + random_salt)`, both sent as query params
- Implemented as a `PostDownloadNotifier` interface — extensible for other integrations
- Does nothing if settings are not configured (all three fields required)

## Key concepts

- **Artist status**: `watched` (full discography tracked), `partial` (only some albums/tracks), `owned`
- **Watch granularity**: can watch at artist, album, or track level
- **Partial-to-full upgrade**: watching all albums for a `partial` artist promotes to `watched`
- **Frontend is provider-unaware**: never passes provider names in API calls (except settings page). Backend resolves from settings/DB.
- **Providers return rank + metadata**: providers control display order and can return arbitrary key-value metadata

## Database

SQLite with WAL mode, single connection. Migrations via goose (embedded SQL files). Foreign keys with `ON DELETE CASCADE`. Entities use `provider` + `provider_id` columns (composite index) instead of provider-specific ID columns.

## Build & deploy

```bash
# Backend
go test ./...
go build ./cmd/crate/
go build ./cmd/provider-musicbrainz/
go build ./cmd/provider-deezer/

# Frontend
cd web && npm install && npm run build

# Proto (only if .proto changes)
PATH="$PATH:$HOME/go/bin" protoc --go_out=. --go_opt=paths=source_relative --go-grpc_out=. --go-grpc_opt=paths=source_relative proto/provider/provider.proto

# Run locally
CRATE_PROVIDERS=musicbrainz:./provider-musicbrainz:50051,deezer:./provider-deezer:50052 \
CRATE_SLSKD_URL=http://localhost:5030 CRATE_SLSKD_API_KEY=xxx ./crate
```

Docker: multi-stage build, builds all three binaries. Alpine runtime. CI: GitHub Actions builds frontend, runs `go test`, then Docker image.

## Testing

Tests live in:
- `internal/api/handlers_test.go` — API integration tests (50+ tests, includes blacklist/cooldown CRUD)
- `internal/activity/activity_test.go` — Activity log unit tests
- `internal/services/downloader/service_test.go` — Scoring system (tier-based, queue, cooldown filtering, balance invariants), retry delay, pickBestFile, blacklist, stale timeouts, inferExt
- `internal/services/navidrome/client_test.go` — Navidrome scan trigger and auth tests

The `testEnv` helper in handlers_test.go wires up real in-memory SQLite, a fake gRPC provider, fake slskd, and an in-memory activity log. Use `newTestEnv(t)` and call `env.do(method, path, body)`. The fake provider returns canned data for artist "1000" with two albums and three tracks.

## Lidarr API Shim

The Lidarr v1 API compatibility shim lives entirely in `internal/api/lidarr.go` (+ `lidarr_test.go`). **Crate is never changed to accommodate Lidarr.** All translation between Lidarr concepts and Crate internals happens inside `lidarr.go`. If Lidarr needs something Crate doesn't expose, the shim adapts — we do not add fields, endpoints, or behaviors to Crate's core code to make Lidarr work. Lidarr compatibility is a convenience, not a requirement.

## Docs maintenance

When adding or changing user-facing features (new settings, API endpoints, scoring changes, download behavior), update all three:
1. `README.md` — features list and configuration table
2. `CLAUDE.md` — technical details for agents (this file)
3. `site/index.html` and `site/docs.html` — marketing site and documentation

The marketing docs at `site/docs.html` include a settings table, API reference, scoring system section, and download flow description that must stay in sync with the code.

## Lessons learned

- **Always add tests for new features.** Run `go test ./...` before pushing. CI gates on this.
- **The `.dockerignore` matters.** If something works locally but fails in Docker, check `.dockerignore` first.
- **FLAC vorbis comment `Add()` appends, not replaces.** Always create a fresh comment block.
- **Frontend should not pass info the backend can resolve.** The backend resolves providers from settings/entity data.
- **Present designs for reaction, don't ask multiple-choice during architecture.** Show one approach and let user redirect.
- **Deezer API needs rate limiting.** 10 req/s. MusicBrainz needs 1 req/s.
- **Cross-device file moves fail with `os.Rename`.** Organizer falls back to copy+delete.
- **CI multiarch builds need QEMU.** Only set multiarch platforms when QEMU is configured (tag builds).
