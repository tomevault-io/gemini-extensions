## Content Guidelines

### Entry Format

The standard entry format used throughout the README is:

```markdown
- [Resource Name](url) by [@username](github-profile) - Brief description
```

**Variations by section:**

- **SDKs / Tools / Examples**: Standard format with GitHub profile attribution
- **Documentation**: Standard format; some entries may omit attribution for official specs
- **Tutorials**: Standard format; some entries may omit `by` attribution
- **Videos**: Title links to YouTube/video URL, no `by` attribution (author in description if needed)
  ```markdown
  - [Video Title](youtube-url) - Brief description
  ```
- **Articles**: Include author name (not necessarily GitHub handle) and optional date
  ```markdown
  - [Article Title](url) by Author Name (Month Year) - Brief description
  ```
- **Community & Resources**: Standard format; some entries may omit attribution
  ```markdown
  - [Resource Name](url) - Brief description
  ```

### Structure and Organization

1. **Table of Contents**:
   - Keep in sync with actual sections
   - Update TOC when adding new sections
   - Use consistent anchor link formatting

2. **Sections**:
   - Group related resources together
   - Maintain consistent section naming
   - Use descriptive section headers

3. **Resource Ordering**:
   - Within sections, order entries **alphabetically by resource name**
   - For articles, order alphabetically within each subsection
   - Group article subsections logically (Technical Deep Dives, Educational, etc.)

### Markdown Style

1. **Headings**:
   - Use ATX-style headings (`#`, `##`, etc.) not Setext-style
   - One H1 (`#`) per file (the title)
   - Maintain proper hierarchy (don't skip levels)
   - Add blank line before and after headings

2. **Links**:
   - Use inline links: `[text](url)`
   - Include link title when helpful: `[text](url "title")`
   - Prefer absolute URLs over relative URLs
   - Use HTTPS protocol for all external links

3. **Lists**:
   - Use `-` for unordered lists (not `*` or `+`)
   - Use consistent indentation (2 spaces for nested lists)
   - Add blank line before and after lists
   - For numbered lists, use `1.`, `2.`, etc.

4. **Emphasis**:
   - Use `**bold**` for emphasis (not `__bold__`)
   - Use `*italic*` for lighter emphasis (not `_italic_`)
   - Use `` `code` `` for inline code/technical terms

5. **Line Length**:
   - No strict line length limit
   - Break lines at natural boundaries (sentences, list items)
   - Keep URLs on same line as their link text

### Content Standards

1. **Descriptions**:
   - Keep brief (1-2 sentences)
   - Be specific about what the resource provides
   - Use active voice
   - Avoid marketing language or superlatives
   - Focus on facts, not opinions

2. **Attributions**:
   - Credit original authors with `by [@username](profile-link)` for code/tools
   - For articles, use `by Author Name` (real name or handle as published)
   - Link to GitHub profiles when available
   - For organizations, link to their GitHub org page

3. **Categorization**:
   - Place resources in the most appropriate section
   - For articles, choose the best-fitting subsection
   - If unsure, suggest new category via issue/PR
   - Avoid duplicate entries across sections

4. **Quality Standards**:
   - Resources should be relevant to JAM development
   - Links must be working and accessible
   - Content should add value to developers/learners
   - Prefer official/authoritative sources when available

## Git Workflow

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:

```
Add [Resource Name] to [Section]

```

**Format**:
- Start with imperative verb (Add, Update, Fix, Remove, etc.)
- Be specific about what changed
- Keep subject line under 72 characters
