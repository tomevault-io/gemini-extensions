## Project Overview

This is a PHP implementation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing applications to provide context for LLMs in a standardized way. The SDK implements both MCP clients and servers with support for stdio and HTTP transports.

**Key characteristics:**
- Designed for native PHP with easy installation via Composer
- Targets PHP 8.1+ with type safety (strict_types=1)
- Supports both traditional CLI/stdio and web hosting environments
- Includes McpServer convenience wrapper for building fully functional MCP servers with just a few lines of PHP code

## Development Testing Commands

### Testing Suite Installation & Dependencies
```bash
# Install dependencies
composer install

# Update dependencies
composer update

# Install pinned conformance tool version
npm install

# Install optional logging support (required for webclient and some examples)
composer require monolog/monolog
```

### Unit Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
./vendor/bin/phpunit
# or via composer script
composer test

# Run specific test file
./vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Server/ServerSessionTest.php

# Run specific test method
./vendor/bin/phpunit --filter testMethodName tests/Server/ServerSessionTest.php
```

### Static Analysis
PHPStan is configured via `phpstan.neon` and available as a dev dependency.
```bash
# Run static analysis
./vendor/bin/phpstan analyse
# or via composer script
composer analyse
```

### Regression Check
The `check` composer script runs the full regression suite (PHPUnit tests followed by PHPStan analysis). Use this before committing changes.
```bash
composer check
```

### Conformance Testing
The SDK integrates the official [MCP conformance test suite](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/conformance) which validates protocol compliance against the spec. The conformance tool version is pinned in `package.json` so tests are reproducible — the baseline file is tied to the installed version.

```bash
# Run all conformance tests (server + client)
composer conformance

# Run server conformance tests only
composer conformance-server

# Run client conformance tests only
composer conformance-client

# Run a single scenario
php conformance/run-conformance.php server tools-list
```

**How it works:**
- Server tests: The runner starts `conformance/everything-server.php` via PHP's built-in server, runs the conformance suite against it, then stops the server automatically via shutdown handler.
- Client tests: The conformance framework spawns `conformance/everything-client.php` with test scenario env vars and a test server URL.
- Known failures are tracked in `conformance/conformance-baseline.yml` with root cause documentation. The conformance tool uses this baseline to distinguish regressions from known limitations — if a previously passing test starts failing, it's flagged as a regression (exit code 1).

**When to run:** Run `composer conformance` after making changes to protocol handling, transport layers, session management, or McpServer. It is not included in `composer check` because it requires Node.js, but should be run separately before merging significant SDK changes.

## Building An MCP Server

The easiest and recommended way to create a new MCP server is to use the McpServer convenience wrapper. Here is a complete fully functional example that can be used as both a local MCP server or a remote MCP server.

```php
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
use Mcp\Server\McpServer;
$server = new McpServer('example-mcp-server');
$server
    ->tool('add', 'Add numbers', fn(float $a, float $b) => "Sum: " . ($a + $b))
    ->prompt('greet', 'Greeting', fn(string $name) => "Hello, {$name}!")
    ->resource(uri: 'info://php', name: 'PHP Info', callback: fn() => PHP_VERSION)
    ->run();
```

When using the convenience wrapper, `run()` is a router that uses the stdio transport on cli applications and the HTTP transport on web servers. `run()` can be replaced with `runStdio()` to force the stdio transport, or `runHttp()` to force the HTTP transport.

## Architecture Overview

### Core Component Layers

1. **Session Layer** (`Shared/BaseSession.php`)
   - Abstract base for all MCP sessions (client and server)
   - Manages JSON-RPC message routing and handler registration
   - Handles request/response matching via request IDs
   - Maintains initialization state and protocol version negotiation

2. **Client Architecture** (`Client/`)
   - `Client`: Main entry point, detects transport (stdio vs HTTP) based on commandOrUrl parameter
   - `ClientSession`: Extends BaseSession, provides high-level methods (`listPrompts()`, `callTool()`, etc.)
   - `Transport/StdioTransport`: Process-based transport using stdin/stdout
   - `Transport/StreamableHttpTransport`: HTTP/HTTPS transport with SSE support
   - Both transports speak JSON-RPC over their respective channels

3. **Server Architecture** (`Server/`)
   - `Server`: Request/notification handler registry, capability management
   - `ServerSession`: Extends BaseSession, handles initialization handshake
   - `ServerRunner`: Stdio runner that manages the server lifecycle
   - `HttpServerRunner`: HTTP runner for web-based servers
   - `McpServer`: Convenience wrapper to simplify building MCP servers
   - Handlers are registered as callables: `registerHandler(string $method, callable $handler)`

4. **Types System** (`Types/`)
   - All MCP protocol types are implemented as typed PHP classes
   - Types implement `McpModel` interface for JSON serialization/deserialization
   - Uses `ExtraFieldsTrait` for forward compatibility with unknown fields
   - Request/Response types follow JSON-RPC 2.0 specification

5. **Transport Abstraction**
   - Stdio: Uses PHP process control (pcntl) for server process management
   - HTTP: Supports both standard HTTP and Server-Sent Events (SSE) for streaming
   - `MemoryStream` for testing without actual I/O
   - `HttpIoInterface`: SAPI adapter seam for the HTTP runner. `NativePhpIo` (default) wraps `header()`/`echo`/`flush()`/`ob_*`/`connection_aborted` for cPanel/Apache/FPM; `BufferedIo` captures bytes for tests or non-SAPI hosts. Pass a custom implementation via `McpServer::httpOptions(['io' => $adapter])` or the `HttpServerRunner` constructor to embed the runner in a framework (Symfony, Slim, FrankenPHP, RoadRunner). `handleRequest()` returns a `StreamedHttpMessage` when the streaming-SSE body was already written through the adapter during handler execution — integrators can check `instanceof StreamedHttpMessage` to skip re-emitting the body.

### Handler Registration Pattern

**Server-side:**
```php
$server
    // Define a tool
    ->tool('add-numbers', 'Adds two numbers together', function (float $a, float $b): string {
        return 'Sum: ' . ($a + $b);
    });
```

**Client-side:**
```php
// ClientSession provides convenience methods that internally send JSON-RPC requests
$prompts = $session->listPrompts();
$result = $session->callTool($toolName, $arguments);
```

### Protocol Version Negotiation

The SDK implements MCP spec version negotiation in `BaseSession`:
- Server advertises supported versions in initialization response
- Client requests specific protocol version in initialization request
- Session negotiates to highest mutually supported version
- Falls back to older versions for backward compatibility
- Current implementation targets 2025-11-25 spec revision

### Web Hosting Considerations

The SDK includes special support for typical PHP web hosting:
- **Stateless mode**: Web client reinitializes connection per request (limitation of web hosting)
- HTTP transport designed to work without long-running processes
- Uses session files or other persistence for maintaining state across requests
- See `webclient/` directory for reference implementation

## Testing Patterns

Tests use PHPUnit 10+ and follow these conventions:

- Test classes are marked `final` and extend `PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase`
- Test methods include detailed docblocks explaining what is being validated
- Mock transports using `MemoryStream` or `InMemoryTransport` for isolation
- Focus on protocol compliance and state transitions
- Test files mirror source structure: `tests/Server/ServerSessionTest.php` tests `src/Server/ServerSession.php`

## Important Implementation Notes

### Type Safety
- All files use `declare(strict_types=1);`
- Parameters and return types are strictly typed
- Use type hints on handler callables for automatic param deserialization

### Error Handling
- Protocol errors throw `Mcp\Shared\McpError`
- Transport errors throw `RuntimeException`
- Invalid parameters throw `InvalidArgumentException`
- Errors are automatically converted to JSON-RPC error responses

### Logging
- All major components accept optional PSR-3 `LoggerInterface`
- Defaults to `NullLogger` if not provided
- Examples use Monolog for demonstration

### OAuth Support
- HTTP transport includes OAuth 2.1 authorization framework
- Server-side implementation available in `Server/Auth/`
- Client-side implementation available in `Client/Auth/`
- See `examples/server_auth/` for usage

## MCP Protocol Capabilities

Servers expose capabilities through handler registration:
- **Prompts**: `prompts/list`, `prompts/get`
- **Resources**: `resources/list`, `resources/read`, `resources/subscribe`
- **Tools**: `tools/list`, `tools/call`
- **Logging**: `logging/setLevel`

Capabilities are automatically detected based on registered handlers and included in initialization response.

## Common Patterns

### Creating a Server (Use convenience wrapper)
1. Instantiate `McpServer` with a name
2. Register tools, prompts, and/or resources for desired capabilities
3. Call `$server->run()` to start

### Creating a Client
1. Instantiate `Client`
2. Call `$client->connect()` with command/URL and parameters
3. Returns initialized `ClientSession`
4. Use session methods to interact with server
5. Call `$client->close()` when done
