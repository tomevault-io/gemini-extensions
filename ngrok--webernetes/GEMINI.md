> This repository implements a browser-friendly simulation of key Kubernetes

This repository implements a browser-friendly simulation of key Kubernetes
components, with an emphasis on:

- an in-process apiserver/storage model
- etcd-like primitives
- a fake client library under `src/client/` that is meant to be type-compatible
  enough with `@kubernetes/client-node` for shared tests to run against both
  the real client and the fake client

The fake client is not a wrapper around the real client and should not depend on
`@kubernetes/client-node` at runtime or in its exported source types. That
package is available as a dev dependency for reference, comparison, and tests
only.

General rules for this repository:

- Prefer preserving the broad structure of the real
  `kubernetes-client/javascript` repository where that helps compatibility, but
  keep the fake implementation human-readable and editable.
- The simulator is not currently trying to support init containers, ephemeral
  containers, or Kubernetes' volumes / CSI subsystem. Keep new simulator work
  scoped to regular containers unless a task explicitly changes that scope.
- The simulator is not currently trying to support image pull secrets,
  credential providers, or private registry authentication. Preserve upstream
  call shapes around image pull credentials where useful for parity, but keep
  credential resolution as a no-op unless a task explicitly expands image
  authentication support.
- The simulator is not currently modeling pod/container resource requests,
  limits, resize policy, in-place pod vertical scaling, or kubelet
  `allocationManager` behavior. Do not add allocation-manager parity code in
  pod workers unless the task explicitly expands simulator resource handling.
- The simulator has partial static pod bookkeeping, but does not currently
  support static pods end to end. Do not add static-pod-specific behavior unless
  the task explicitly expands static pod support.
- The simulator does not currently model Kubernetes `RuntimeClass` objects or
  kubelet's `runtimeClassManager`. Preserve upstream call shapes around runtime
  handlers where useful for parity, but resolve runtime handlers as the default
  empty string unless a task explicitly expands RuntimeClass support.
- In cluster simulation code, do not call global timer/time APIs such as
  `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, or `Date.now` directly. Route timeout, interval,
  and current-time behavior through the cluster `Clock` instance so the
  simulator can be paused and controlled deterministically.
- When a function or constructor accepts a `context.Context`, make that argument
  the first parameter and name it `ctx`, matching Kubernetes Go conventions.
- For intentionally unused parameters, prefix the parameter name with an
  underscore, such as `_ctx`; do not add `void parameter;` statements just to
  silence unused-variable checks.
- When transliterating Go functions into TypeScript, use TypeScript naming
  conventions for function names. In particular, do not preserve Go's exported
  initial capital; `GetPartialReference` should become `getPartialReference`.
- When mirroring Go code that returns `(value, error)`, prefer explicit tuple
  returns such as `[value, err]` over throwing exceptions. If you find
  try/catch or thrown errors in mirrored code where upstream returns an error,
  treat that as parity debt and convert it unless there is a clear local
  boundary that requires exceptions.
- Do not copy upstream comments when transliterating code. Keep local comments
  only when they explain simulator-specific behavior or non-obvious local
  constraints; readers can refer to the upstream source for upstream commentary.
- Files that mirror upstream Kubernetes code should keep local source-mapping
  comments in the form `// Models <upstream path> <name>` before mirrored
  declarations. These comments are not copied upstream commentary; they are
  required breadcrumbs for reviewing parity.
- For Kubernetes `pkg/` paths, this repository's `src/` directory acts as the
  package root. For example, upstream `pkg/util/parsers` should be mirrored
  under `src/util/parsers`, not `src/pkg/util/parsers`.
- When changing code that mimics real Kubernetes behavior, protect parity even
  in conversation. If a requested change would move the implementation away
  from the upstream structure or behavior being modeled, challenge the request,
  explain the parity issue, and lay out the viable options before editing.
- When mirroring Go `iota` enums in TypeScript, use string unions for the named
  enum values. If code needs to model the Go zero value, use the first `iota`
  enum value; do not add an empty string to the union to emulate a zero value.
- When adding zero-value helper constructors in TypeScript, name them
  `new<TypeName>`, such as `newContainerStatus`, accept a `DeepPartial` of the
  type they create for overrides, and define them in the same file as the type
  they construct.
- Simulator behavior is currently targeting Kubernetes 1.36. A local checkout
  of `kubernetes/kubernetes` at commit
  `ecf6decece6a6de25a57aad9ba90b6ce580f6f78` is available at
  `~/Developer/github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes` for upstream source reference.
- When asked to copy, mirror, port, transliterate, audit, or compare against
  upstream Kubernetes code, treat the upstream source as the specification.
  Mechanical fidelity is more important than local cleanup or simplification.
- For Kubernetes parity tasks, do not collapse, rename, combine, or omit
  upstream constructs merely because the local behavior would be equivalent.
  Preserve upstream control flow, test table shape, case names, helper names,
  expected fields, and distinctions such as literal empty maps versus
  helper-built maps unless an existing repository constraint explicitly prevents
  it.
- For Kubernetes parity tests that need access to upstream package-private
  state, prefer making the corresponding TypeScript internal state
  package-visible/exported over adding helper-only behavior or driving a
  different public lifecycle. This keeps tests mechanically close to upstream
  and avoids `any` casts.
- Passing tests are necessary but not sufficient for upstream parity work. The
  resulting implementation or test should remain reviewable side by side with
  upstream.
- If upstream code depends on simulator scope that is intentionally unsupported,
  do not silently omit it. State the unsupported dependency, explain why it
  cannot be copied directly, and either keep the closest explicit placeholder
  shape or ask before skipping it.
- Before finishing upstream parity work, do a line-by-line audit against the
  upstream file and report any intentional deviations with concrete reasons.
  If uncertain whether a shortcut is acceptable, assume it is not acceptable and
  preserve the upstream structure.
- Shared tests should exercise the same calling code against the real client and
  the fake client. Favor changes that make the fake's public exported types line
  up with the real client's public exported types closely enough that unions and
  shared tests work naturally.
- Unless it is literally impossible to do so, test Kubernetes behavior through
  the parity tests in `src/client/tests/` so the simulated cluster is checked
  against real Kubernetes behavior.
- Top-level test suites must use the repository harness describes:
  `browser.describe` for browser-safe unit tests, `kubernetes.describe` for
  Kubernetes parity tests, and `etcd.describe` or `fakeEtcd.describe` for etcd
  coverage. Nested raw `describe` blocks inside a harness suite are acceptable
  for grouping.
- When adding functionality or fixing a behavior mismatch, write the test first
  and run it before the fix. For Kubernetes-facing behavior, observe the test
  fail against the simulator and pass against k3s before changing the
  implementation. If a simulator-only unit test is more appropriate, still
  observe the targeted simulator failure before implementing the fix.
- Do not introduce adapter-only type shims just to paper over mismatches between
  the real and fake clients.
- Do not introduce interfaces or types with names ending in `Like`.
- Do not use `any` as a shortcut around compatibility problems.
- When matching the real client, care most about the public exported surface and
  the specific generated types reachable from that surface. Internal generator
  structure does not need to be mirrored unless it materially helps
  compatibility or maintainability.
- It is acceptable to inspect the real client in `node_modules/` to understand
  shapes and signatures, but do not import from it in the fake client source.
- In this repo the package is installed at `node_modules/@kubernetes/client-node`
  and may be a pnpm symlink. For generated API and request shapes, prefer the
  `.d.ts` files under `node_modules/@kubernetes/client-node/dist/gen/`, notably
  `dist/gen/apis/*.d.ts` and `dist/gen/types/ObjectParamAPI.d.ts`.

Client-specific rules:

- Read `src/client/AGENTS.md` before changing files under `src/client/`.
- Read `src/client/tests/AGENTS.md` before changing parity tests under
  `src/client/tests/`.
- Read `src/client/gen/models/AGENTS.md` before adding or editing files under
  `src/client/gen/models/`.
- If adding API files under `src/client/gen/apis/`, keep them aligned with the
  real client's public API class names and method signatures as much as
  possible.

When making compatibility changes, prefer the following order:

1. Fix the fake exported types so they better match the real client.
2. Fix the fake implementation so behavior matches the shared tests.
3. Only change shared tests when the test itself is wrong or is asserting an
   unnecessary implementation detail.
