# DMP Builder — research, institutions, FAIR

Skill for building Data Management Plans across three context families:

1. **Funded projects** (Horizon Europe, ERC, MSCA, PRIN/MUR, DFG, ANR, NWO, SNSF, AEI, etc.)
2. **Research institutions** (universities, centres, ERIC infrastructures, digital libraries)
3. **FAIR-aligned contexts** without a specific funder

> For the **Italian public administration** (municipalities, ASL local health authorities, public schools with citizen-facing services) there is a dedicated skill: `governance-dati-pa`. That domain is regulated by CAD, Italian GDPR, Legislative Decrees 33/2013, 36/2006, 144/2024, with effects quite different from research. If the use case is PA, redirect.

## Orientating principle: European digital sovereignty

When the DMP requires third-party services (data repositories, DOI provider, storage, compute, code hosting, communication, persistent identifiers, bibliographic management), this skill primarily recommends:

1. **Services with European incorporation**: Zenodo (CERN), EUDAT B2SHARE/B2HANDLE/B2DROP, OpenAIRE, DataCite (Hannover-based), EOSC, OVHcloud (FR), Hetzner (DE), Scaleway (FR), Aruba Cloud (IT), IONOS (DE), Open Telekom Cloud (DE), Codeberg (DE, e.V.), Framagit (FR, Framasoft), Nextcloud (DE), CryptPad (FR, XWiki SAS), Element/Matrix (UK-FR), BigBlueButton (open source, EU-hostable), Jitsi (open source, EU-hostable), HedgeDoc (open source, DE-NL community).
2. **As alternative, open source self-hostable on EU infrastructure**: Forgejo/Gitea, Harbor, GitLab CE/EE, Galaxy Europe, institutional Dataverse, Frictionless Data, FAIR Data Point.

US-incorporated proprietary services (GitHub.com, AWS, Azure, GCP, Google Drive, Dropbox, Figshare, Mendeley, Slack, Notion, Zoom, Microsoft Teams) are acceptable **only** when:

- The institution mandates them as internal standard with which the project must align
- No equivalent alternative exists for the specific case (e.g. ORCID remains de facto, no European equivalent exists)
- The data passing through them is already public/non-sensitive (e.g. GitHub only for open source code without restricted data)

In any case, **justify the choice in the DMP** and indicate a migration plan. See `references/european-services.md` for the full per-category map.

> Important note on **ORCID** and **ROR**: these are de facto international standards for researcher and organisation identity. Both are incorporated as non-profits in the United States. No European alternative has equivalent adoption. The skill recommends them regardless, because their absence would damage *findability* and *interoperability* of the data — the very FAIR principles the DMP intends to guarantee. Document in the DMP that the choice is driven by standard pervasiveness.

## Operational flow

### 1. Understanding the context (eliciting)

Three questions, skip those already answered:

1. **Context**: funded project (which funder?) / institutional / FAIR-aligned without funder
2. **Predominant data type**: experimental quantitative / observational / qualitative / computational (simulations) / synthesis (review/meta) / geospatial / biological sequences / digital cultural heritage / mixed
3. **Expected deliverable**: full plan / template to fill / checklist / FAIR self-assessment / specific section (e.g. publication strategy only)

If the user explicitly invites a collaborative session (*"let's write it together", "step by step"*), switch to §1a.

### 1a. Collaborative mode (iterative co-authoring)

**Trigger**: "let's write it together", "let's work on it", "iteratively", "step by step", "block by block", or when the user provides specific project input (acronym, funding, WPs, expected datasets) to incorporate.

**Behaviour**: in collaborative mode **do not dump the full template as the first reply**. Work in blocks:

1. **Project identification**: title/acronym, funding, partners, PI, ORCID, duration. 2–3 questions.
2. **Inventory of planned datasets**: one card per dataset (name, type, estimated volume, project phase, reuse of existing data).
3. **For each dataset**: metadata standards, quality control, active storage, sharing strategy, licence, target repository, PID strategy.
4. **Cross-cutting sections**: legal/ethical (GDPR, consents, IP, ethics committee), resources and responsibilities (data steward, costs).
5. **FAIR self-assessment**: a status table for each of the four dimensions.
6. **Final output**: the complete DMP as a file, tailored to the case.

At each block: 1–3 targeted questions, summary, explicit confirmation before proceeding.

### 2. Composing the deliverable

**Asset = deliverable** (call `present_files`). **Reference** = informs the response, not presented.

| User request | Primary asset (present) | References to consult |
|---|---|---|
| DMP for Horizon Europe / ERC / MSCA | `assets/dmp-horizon-europe.md` | `references/funder-requirements.md`, `references/fair-principles.md`, `references/european-services.md` |
| Institutional DMP (university, centre) | `assets/dmp-institutional.md` | `references/fair-principles.md`, `references/european-services.md` |
| FAIR-only DMP, no specific funder | `assets/dmp-fair.md` | `references/fair-principles.md` |
| Operational checklist | `assets/dmp-checklist.md` | — |
| Frictionless Data Package | `assets/datapackage-template.md` | — |
| FAIR self-assessment only | — (prose with table) | `references/fair-principles.md` |
| Repository choice | — (prose with comparison) | `references/repositories-and-pids.md`, `references/european-services.md` |
| Licence choice | — (prose with logical flowchart) | `references/licensing.md` |
| CI pipeline for validation/deposit | — (prose with YAML examples) | `references/ci-and-automation.md`, `scripts/deposit_zenodo.py` |
| Which funder requires what | — (prose) | `references/funder-requirements.md` |
| Digital sovereignty: which service to pick | — (prose with table) | `references/european-services.md` |
| GDPR for research / Art. 89 / consent / DPIA / cross-border transfers | — (prose) | `references/gdpr-research.md` |
| Data paper / dataset paper — journal choice and strategy | — (prose with comparison) | `references/data-papers.md` |

### 3. Funder compliance

Funders have different structures. **Do not improvise**: consult `references/funder-requirements.md` for the structure required by Horizon Europe, ERC, MSCA, PRIN/MUR, DFG, ANR, NWO, SNSF. The Horizon Europe template (section 4 of the *Annotated Grant Agreement*) is the most widespread and many national funders adopt variations of it.

For Horizon Europe: the DMP is a **mandatory deliverable** within 6 months of project start, with updates at least mid-project and end-of-project. The structure follows the 6 sections of the **Horizon Europe DMP template** (Data summary, FAIR data, Resources, Data security, Ethical aspects, Other issues) — informed by but distinct from the Science Europe Practical Guide's six core requirements (see `references/funder-requirements.md`).

### 4. FAIR self-assessment

Every DMP produced by this skill **includes a FAIR self-assessment section** with status per principle. See `references/fair-principles.md` for operational criteria. Recommended format: table with a Status column (✅/⚠️/❌) and brief Notes for each of the 15 FAIR sub-principles.

### 5. Digital sovereignty — operationalisation

When you produce a service recommendation in a DMP:

1. **European default**: first cite the EU-incorporated or EU-hosted OSS service that fits the case.
2. **Justify**: add a line on why that choice (sovereignty, GDPR by-design compliance, EU hosting).
3. **Alternatives**: if the institution has constraints toward non-European services, indicate migrability criteria (open formats, periodic export, contract with portability clause).
4. **DOI**: always recommend DataCite (EU-based) as the provider, via Zenodo, B2SHARE, or institutional registrar.

### 6. Tone and language

The typical user is a PI, data steward, institutional repository manager, digital librarian, or research project manager. Use the field's standard vocabulary (PI, dataset, WP, deliverable, FAIR, RDM, etc.) without re-defining common terms.

**Language**: follow the user. In research, English is frequent even for non-Anglophone researchers; many DMPs are written directly in English because the funder evaluates them in English. If the user alternates, let them. Do not impose any language on principle.

### 7. Anti-patterns to flag

- **DMP as a formal compliance exercise**, written once and forgotten. It is a *living document*, to be updated at least at M18 (mid-project) and M36/end.
- **Repository chosen at random**: the choice determines DOI, longevity, certification (CoreTrustSeal), API. See `references/repositories-and-pids.md`.
- **"We'll publish on GitHub"** for data: GitHub is not a data repository, has no DOI, does not guarantee preservation. Code yes (with mirror on an EU forge and DOI via Zenodo-GitHub integration or equivalent).
- **Incompatible licences** across dataset, code, article: state the combination and verify compatibility (CC-BY 4.0 for data, MIT/Apache/EUPL for code, CC-BY or paywall for article).
- **"Anonymisation" of research data on human subjects without considering informed consent**: consent includes publication, and pseudonymisation remains personal data (see `references/fair-principles.md` under *Accessible*).
- **DOI obtained but metadata poor**: having a DOI is not enough for *findability*. Rich, indexable metadata are needed.
- **Sovereignty ignored or treated as a slogan**: citing non-European services without justification, or proclaiming "all European" and then recommending Google Drive in the details.
- **ORCID/ROR replaced by internal institutional identifiers**: breaks *findability*. Use ORCID/ROR as the standard, integrate them with local identifiers.

## Example invocations

Concrete examples of how the skill is expected to be invoked and which deliverable it produces. These are illustrative — adapt to the user's actual wording.

### Example 1 — Horizon Europe project, full DMP

> **User**: *"I need to write the M6 DMP for our Horizon Europe project HORIZON-CL5-2024-D1-01 on energy storage. The consortium has 8 partners across 6 countries."*

**Expected behaviour**: short eliciting (data types, who is the data steward), then present `assets/dmp-horizon-europe.md` as deliverable, pre-filled with the call ID and a placeholder for the dataset inventory. Consult `references/funder-requirements.md` for HE timing and `references/european-services.md` for the technical infrastructure table.

### Example 2 — collaborative co-authoring of an MSCA-PF DMP

> **User**: *"Let's write the DMP for my MSCA Postdoctoral Fellowship together, step by step."*

**Expected behaviour**: trigger §1a (collaborative mode). Do not dump the full template. Start with project identification (3 questions), then dataset inventory block-by-block. Build the final DMP only after the user has confirmed each block.

### Example 3 — single section: repository choice

> **User**: *"For a neuroimaging dataset (~200 GB, BIDS format), which repository should I use? Sovereign if possible."*

**Expected behaviour**: prose answer with a comparison table (no asset to present). Consult `references/repositories-and-pids.md` (life-sciences and neuroimaging section, including the standard-driven OpenNeuro exception) and `references/european-services.md`. Recommend EBRAINS as EU primary + OpenNeuro as discipline-standard secondary, with mirror on Zenodo. Justify in DMP terms.

### Example 4 — institutional DMP, no specific funder

> **User**: *"Our university library wants to draft an institutional Research Data Management policy."*

**Expected behaviour**: present `assets/dmp-institutional.md`. Consult `references/fair-principles.md` for the self-assessment section and `references/european-services.md` for the recommended sovereign stack.

### Example 5 — out-of-scope redirect

> **User**: *"DMP for the open data of the municipality of Bologna."*

**Expected behaviour**: do NOT use this skill. Redirect to `governance-dati-pa` (Italian PA regulatory framework, CAD/GDPR/Legislative Decrees).

## Maintenance notes

The skill is designed to be versioned on git. Update:

- **Funder requirements** when calls change templates (annual check at least).
- **European services map** when new EU-incorporated offerings emerge, or when an EU service changes ownership to a non-European group (e.g. acquisitions, M&A).
- **FAIR principles** when GO FAIR releases new metrics or when EOSC publishes new interoperability requirements.
- **Repositories** when a repository gains/loses CoreTrustSeal certification or when API endpoints change.
