### Multi-Repository Architecture

**Universal Framework:** Code work is handled automatically by the `sk-code` skill. It detects the active code surface from CWD/target paths and library markers, loads patterns from `.opencode/skills/sk-code/references/<surface>/`, and selects surface-appropriate verification (see Quick Reference). Surfaces it does not recognize trigger a disambiguation question rather than guessing. The active detection markers and per-surface patterns live inside `sk-code` — see `.opencode/skills/sk-code/SKILL.md` §2 Smart Routing.

**The Iron Law:** NO completion claims without running stack-appropriate verification.

## 1. 🚨 CRITICAL RULES

### Safety Constraints

#### The Four Laws — HARD BLOCKERS (cannot be overridden)

1. **READ FIRST** — Never edit a file without reading it first. Understand context before modifying.
2. **SCOPE LOCK** — Only modify files explicitly in scope. **NO** "cleaning up" or "improving" adjacent code. Scope in `spec.md` is FROZEN.
3. **VERIFY** — Syntax checks and tests **MUST** pass before claiming completion. **NO** blind commits.
4. **HALT** — Stop immediately if uncertain, if line numbers don't match, or if tests fail.

#### PLAN-WORKFLOW LOCK — HARD BLOCKER (cannot be overridden)

When an approved plan names a specific workflow, command, agent or skill (for example `/deep:start-context-loop`, `@ai-council`, `sk-code`), that named workflow is **FROZEN like scope**. Before substituting a manual or alternative approach:

1. **VERIFY, don't assume** — READ the named workflow's contract (its `SKILL.md` or command doc) to test any friction you believe it has. A remembered manual pattern is NOT evidence the proper tool carries the limitation you recall.
2. **FLAG deviations** — If it genuinely blocks the task, STATE the deviation to the user ("plan says X, I propose Y because Z") and get approval before proceeding.
3. **NEVER silently hand-roll a substitute** for a plan-named purpose-built workflow, and never repeat such a substitution across steps once chosen.

Reinventing a workflow's core feature because you assumed friction you never checked against its contract is a HARD violation.

#### Halt Conditions — Stop and Report

- Target file does not exist or line numbers don't match.
- Syntax check or tests fail after edit.
- Merge conflicts encountered.
- Edit tool reports "string not found".
- Test/Production boundary is unclear.

#### Operational Mandates

**Documentation & Honesty**
- **All file modifications require a spec folder** (Gate 3).
- **Never lie or fabricate** — use "UNKNOWN" when uncertain.
- **Clarify** if confidence < 80% (see §4 Confidence Framework).
- **Use explicit uncertainty:** Prefix claims with "I'M UNCERTAIN ABOUT THIS:".

**Code Quality**
- **Comment Hygiene [HARD] BLOCK** — Never embed ephemeral tracking artifact labels in code comments: no spec-folder paths, packet/phase numbers, ADR ids, task/checklist/requirement ids, or finding ids (`// ADR-007:`, `// REQ-003:`, `// specs/042-foo` are all forbidden). Keep the durable WHY; drop the perishable label. Allowed stable references: `// CWE-79`, `// RFC 2616`, `// POSIX`.

**Dispatch Rules**
- **CLI dispatch rule** — Before composing any `cli-X` prompt (codex / claude-code / opencode), MUST `Read` `.opencode/skills/cli-X/SKILL.md` first. Skills carry model-specific prompt contracts not in `--help`; required for every `<binary> --model <X>` invocation.
- **Small-model dispatch rule** — Before dispatching to small models (MiniMax, Kimi, Qwen, etc. via cli-opencode), MUST consult `sk-prompt-small-model` — canonical home for context-budget defaults, output-verification, model-profile registry, permissions schema, and dispatch matrix (executor + provider + quota_pool).

### Request Analysis & Execution

**Flow:** Parse request → Read files first → Analyze → Design simplest solution → Validate → Execute

#### Execution Behavior

- **Plan before acting** on multi-step work. Decide which files to read first, which tools to use, and how the result will be verified before making changes.
- **Use a research-first approach.** Read the actual code, docs, and local instructions first. Never use an edit-first approach, and prefer surgical edits over broad rewrites.
- **Apply project-specific conventions from `AGENTS.md`** before acting.
- **Take responsibility for issues encountered during execution.** Do not dodge ownership with phrases like `not caused by my changes` or `pre-existing issue`; work toward the fix.
- **Do not stop early when the requested solution is still incomplete.** Do not frame partial progress as a `good stopping point`, `natural checkpoint`, or `future work` when a safe path forward exists.
- **Do not ask for permission to continue when the next safe step is already clear and in scope.** Avoid `should I continue?` or `want me to keep going?` when you can proceed safely under the existing rules.
- **Use frequent self-checks and reasoning loops** to catch and fix your own mistakes before asking for help.
- **Reason from actual data, not assumptions.** Verify against the real files, outputs, and behavior in front of you.

### Required Tools & Search Routing

**MANDATORY TOOLS:**
- **Spec Kit Memory MCP** - research, context recovery, saves. See Memory Save Rule below for save mechanics.
- **System Code Graph MCP** - structural code search, impact analysis, and relationship queries. Use with Grep for concept discovery; `memory_search` indexes spec docs and saved memory, not arbitrary code.
- **Git (sk-git)** - worktree setup, conventional commits, PR creation. Full details: `.opencode/skills/sk-git/`. Trigger keywords: worktree, branch, commit, merge, pr, pull request, git workflow, finish work, integrate changes

**CODE SEARCH DECISION TREE:**

```text
Need to find code?
  |
  +-- Know the exact text/token/symbol?
  |     YES --> Grep (exact match)
  |
  +-- Know the file name or path?
  |     YES --> Glob (pattern match)
  |
  +-- Searching by concept, intent, or "how does X work"?
  |     YES --> Code Graph structural query + Grep pattern search
  |             +-- Verify hits with Read
  |             +-- Iterate Grep terms from likely symbols, filenames, domain words, and errors
  |
  +-- Exploring unfamiliar code?
        YES --> Code Graph overview/structure FIRST, then Grep/Glob and Read to fill gaps
```

Hybrid code discovery triggers: "find code that does X", "how is X implemented", "where is the logic for X", "similar code", "find patterns", exploring unfamiliar modules, and any intent-based query where exact tokens are unknown.

| Approach | Command | When |
| -------- | ------- | ---- |
| **Code Graph** | `code_graph_query`, `code_graph_context`, `detect_changes` | Structural discovery: callers, imports, symbols, outlines, impact |
| **Grep** | `rg -n "<pattern>" <path>` | Concept discovery via likely tokens, domain terms, filenames, and errors |
| **Glob** | `rg --files <path> \| rg "<path-pattern>"` | File/path discovery |

Use `memory_search` only for spec docs, saved decisions, and memory context. It does not index arbitrary project code.

### Startup & Resume Recovery

Hook-capable runtimes (Claude, Codex, OpenCode) may inject startup context when wired. Per-runtime triggers: `.opencode/skills/system-spec-kit/references/config/hook_system.md`. Feature-flag defaults: `.opencode/skills/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/ENV_REFERENCE.md` ("Feature flags reference table").

**Recovery flow when hooks are unavailable or fail:**

1. `/speckit:resume` is the canonical surface; rebuild context in order: `handover.md` → `_memory.continuity` → canonical spec docs (`implementation-summary.md` → `tasks.md` → `plan.md` → `spec.md`).
2. **Phase parent** (target has `[0-9]{3}-name/` children with their own spec/description): honor `graph-metadata.json.derived.last_active_child_id`, else list children with statuses. Lean trio policy — only `spec.md`, `description.json`, `graph-metadata.json` live at parent; read the chosen child's continuity ladder, NOT the parent's plan/tasks/implementation-summary.
3. Stale or missing structural context: run `session_bootstrap()`, then `code_graph_scan` if needed. Graph unavailable: use Grep/Glob + direct reads, but keep the packet-local continuity ladder as source-of-truth. Code-graph implementation/docs are owned by `.opencode/skills/system-code-graph/`; tool names stay stable.
4. Re-anchor on spec folder, current task, blockers, and next steps before making changes.

### Quality & Anti-Patterns

**QUALITY PRINCIPLES:**
- **Prefer simplicity**, reuse existing patterns, and cite evidence with sources
- Solve only the stated problem; **avoid over-engineering** and premature optimization
- **Verify with checks** (simplicity, performance, maintainability, scope) before making changes
- **Truth over agreement** - correct user misconceptions with evidence; do not agree for conversational flow

**ANTI-PATTERNS (Detect Silently):**

| Anti-Pattern           | Trigger Phrases                                 | Response                                                                    |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Over-engineering       | "for flexibility", "future-proof", "might need" | Ask: "Is this solving a current problem or a hypothetical one?"             |
| Premature optimization | "could be slow", "might bottleneck"             | Ask: "Has this been measured? What's the actual performance?"               |
| Cargo culting          | "best practice", "always should"                | Ask: "Does this pattern fit this specific case?"                            |
| Gold-plating           | "while we're here", "might as well"             | Flag scope creep: "That's a separate change - shall I note it for later?"   |
| Wrong abstraction      | "DRY this up" for 2 instances                   | "These look similar but might not be the same concept. Let's verify first." |
| Scope creep            | "also add", "bonus feature"                     | "That's outside the current scope. Want to track it separately?"            |

**ANALYSIS LENSES:**

| Lens               | Focus            | Detection Questions                                                                |
| ------------------ | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CLARITY**        | Simplicity       | Is this the simplest code that solves the problem? Are abstractions earned?        |
| **SYSTEMS**        | Dependencies     | What does this change touch? What calls this? What are the side effects?           |
| **BIAS**           | Wrong problem    | Is user solving a symptom? Is this premature optimization? Is the framing correct? |
| **SUSTAINABILITY** | Maintainability  | Will future devs understand this? Is it self-documenting? Tech debt implications?  |
| **VALUE**          | Actual impact    | Does this change behavior or just refactor? Is it cosmetic or functional?          |
| **SCOPE**          | Complexity match | Does solution complexity match problem size? Single-line fix or new abstraction?   |

## 2. ⛔ MANDATORY GATES - STOP BEFORE ACTING

**⚠️ BEFORE using ANY tool (except Gate Actions: memory_match_triggers, skill_advisor.py), you MUST pass all applicable gates below.**

### 🔒 PRE-EXECUTION GATES (Pass before ANY tool use)

#### GATE 1: UNDERSTANDING + CONTEXT SURFACING [SOFT] BLOCK
Trigger: EACH new user message (re-evaluate even in ongoing conversations)
1. Call `memory_match_triggers(prompt)` → Surface relevant context
2. Classify intent: Research or Implementation
3. Parse request → Check confidence AND uncertainty (see §4)
4. **Dual-threshold:** confidence ≥ 0.70 AND uncertainty ≤ 0.35 → PROCEED. Either fails → INVESTIGATE (max 3 iterations) → ESCALATE. Simple: <40% ASK | 40-69% CAUTION | ≥70% PASS

####  GATE 2: SKILL ROUTING [REQUIRED for non-trivial tasks]
1. A) Primary: use the automatic Skill Advisor Hook brief already surfaced by the runtime when present. See `.opencode/skills/system-spec-kit/references/hooks/skill-advisor-hook.md`.
2. B) Fallback: run `python3 .opencode/skills/system-skill-advisor/mcp_server/scripts/skill_advisor.py "[request]" --threshold 0.8` when no hook brief is present, when scripting a check, or when diagnosing hook behavior.
3. C) Cite user's explicit direction: "User specified: [exact quote]"
- Confidence ≥ 0.8 → MUST invoke skill | < 0.8 → general approach | User names skill → cite and proceed
- Output: `SKILL ROUTING: [result]` or `SKILL ROUTING: User directed → [name]`
- Skip: trivial queries only (greetings, single-line questions)

#### GATE 3: SPEC FOLDER QUESTION [HARD] BLOCK - PRIORITY GATE
- **Overrides Gates 1-2:** If file modification detected → ask Gate 3 BEFORE any analysis/tool calls
- **Machine contract:** `.opencode/skills/system-spec-kit/shared/gate-3-classifier.ts` (`classifyPrompt()`). The prose lists below are human-readable; the classifier module is authoritative for runtimes that call it.
- **Positive triggers (write actions):** create, add, remove, delete, rename, move, update, change, modify, edit, fix, patch, refactor, rewrite, implement, build, write, generate, configure
- **Positive triggers (continuity writes):** `save context`, `save memory`, `/memory:save`, `/speckit:resume`, `resume iteration`, `resume deep research`, `resume deep review`, `continue iteration` (these produce `description.json` / `graph-metadata.json` / continuity frontmatter / `iteration-NNN.md` writes)
- **Read-only disqualifiers:** `review`, `audit`, `inspect`, `analyze`, `explain` — suppress Gate 3 when they appear ALONE (e.g. "review the decomposition phase"). Do NOT suppress when a continuity-write trigger is also present.
- **Note:** tokens `analyze`, `decompose`, `phase` are NOT positive triggers; they false-positive on read-only review prompts.
- **Options:** A) Existing | B) New | C) Update related | D) Skip | E) Phase folder (e.g., `specs/NNN-name/001-phase/`)
- **Router commands:** For router-style commands such as `/doctor`, evaluate Gate 3 per selected route. The route manifest/table must expose each target's location and mutation class before asking or acting:
  - `read-only` routes may inspect and report without a spec-folder write path.
  - `add-only` routes may create scoped logs, snapshots, or evidence after Gate 3 is satisfied.
  - `mutates` routes require the same spec-folder discipline as any other file/database mutation.
- **Ask first, then act.** No Read/Edit/Write/Bash (except Gate Actions) before answer. The answer applies for the ENTIRE session — re-ask ONLY when user says "new task" / "different feature" / names a different spec folder, or asks you to re-ask.

#### GATE 4: SKILL-OWNED WORKFLOW TIEBREAKERS
Trigger-phrase routing ("deep-research", "deep-review", ":auto", "iterations", "convergence") and state-machine discipline (no manual `/tmp` state, no direct `@deep-research` / `@deep-review` Task dispatch, no skipping `deep-research-state.jsonl` / `deltas/` / `logs/`) are enforced by Gate 2 (Skill Advisor at ≥ 0.8) plus the `/deep:start-research-loop` and `/deep:start-review-loop` skill SKILL.md invariants. The two tiebreakers below are NOT covered there:
- **Executor CLI ≠ skill route.** "Use cli-codex gpt-5.5 high" is the HOW — it still runs INSIDE the skill's workflow. Never let the executor name override the skill-owned route.
- **Skill advisor ambiguity.** When `command-spec-kit` matches alongside `cli-*` for iteration phrases, `command-spec-kit` wins. The CLI executor is a tool inside the command's workflow, not a replacement for it.

#### CONSOLIDATED QUESTION PROTOCOL
Consolidate multiple questions into a SINGLE prompt before any analysis or tool calls — never split across messages. **Bypass phrases:** "skip context" / "fresh start" / "skip memory" / [skip] for memory loading; Level 1 tasks skip completion verification.

---

### 🔒 POST-EXECUTION GATES

#### MEMORY SAVE RULE [HARD] BLOCK
Trigger: "save context", "save memory", `/memory:save`
- If spec folder established at Gate 3 → USE IT (don't re-ask). Carry-over applies ONLY to memory saves
- If NO folder and Gate 3 never answered → HARD BLOCK → Ask user
- **Full save (DB + embeddings + graph):** `node .opencode/skills/system-spec-kit/scripts/dist/memory/generate-context.js`
  - AI composes structured JSON with session context, writes to `/tmp/save-context-data.json`, passes as first arg. Alternatively use `--json '<inline-json>'` or `--stdin`.
  - Also refreshes `graph-metadata.json` and `description.json` for the spec folder.
- **Quick continuity update:** AI may directly edit `_memory.continuity` YAML frontmatter blocks in `implementation-summary.md` without running generate-context.js (per ADR-004). The resume ladder only reads continuity from `implementation-summary.md`.
- **Indexing:** For immediate MCP visibility after save: `memory_index_scan({ specFolder })` or `memory_save()`
- **Post-Save Review:** After `generate-context.js` completes, check the POST-SAVE QUALITY REVIEW output.
  - **HIGH** issues: MUST manually patch via Edit tool (fix title, trigger_phrases, importance_tier)
  - **MEDIUM** issues: patch when practical
  - **PASSED/SKIPPED**: no action needed

#### COMPLETION VERIFICATION RULE [HARD] BLOCK
Trigger: Claiming "done", "complete", "finished", "works"
1. Run `bash .opencode/skills/system-spec-kit/scripts/spec/validate.sh <spec-folder> --strict` (Exit 0 = pass, 1 = warnings, 2 = errors).
2. Load `checklist.md` → verify ALL items → mark `[x]` with evidence.
3. Reconcile completion metadata so packet docs do not claim conflicting completion states — covers:
   - `spec.md` status and shipped/current-state claims.
   - `plan.md` / `tasks.md` / `checklist.md` evidence rows.
   - `handover.md` or `_memory.continuity` fields when present.
   - `implementation-summary.md` final state, validation evidence, and continuation notes.
- Skip: Level 1 tasks (no checklist.md required).

#### VIOLATION RECOVERY [SELF-CORRECTION]
Trigger: About to skip gates, or realized gates were skipped → STOP → STATE: "Before I proceed, I need to ask about documentation:" → ASK Gate 3 (A/B/C/D/E) → WAIT
- **Exception:** If the user already answered Gate 3 earlier in this conversation for the same task, do NOT re-ask. Reuse the existing answer and proceed.

#### Self-Check (before ANY tool-using response):
- [ ] File modification? Asked spec folder question?
- [ ] Skill routing verified?
- [ ] Saving memory? Using `generate-context.js` (not Write tool)?
- [ ] Aligned with ORIGINAL request? No scope drift?
- [ ] Claiming completion? `checklist.md` verified?

## 3. 📝 SPEC FOLDER DOCUMENTATION

Every conversation that modifies files MUST have a spec folder. **Full details:** system-spec-kit SKILL.md (§1 When to Use, §3 How it Works, §4 Rules)

### Documentation Levels

| Level            | LOC                     | Required Files                                                         | Use When                                                                                          |

| **2**            | 100-499                 | Level 1 + checklist.md                                                 | QA validation needed                                                                              |
| **3**            | ≥500                    | Level 2 + decision-record.md (+ optional research.md, resource-map.md) | Complex/architecture changes                                                                      |
| **3+**           | Complexity 80+          | Level 3 + AI protocols, extended checklist, sign-offs                  | Multi-agent, enterprise governance                                                                |
| **Phase Parent** | n/a (control file only) | spec.md, description.json, graph-metadata.json                         | Folder contains phase children (`[0-9]{3}-name/` subdirs with their own spec.md/description.json) |

**Optional cross-cutting docs (any level)**: `handover.md`, `debug-delegation.md`, `research.md`, and `resource-map.md` - copy from `.opencode/skills/system-spec-kit/templates/` as needed. For phase parents that have undergone reorganization (renames, gap renumbering, consolidation), `context-index.md` provides a migration bridge — optional, no required template.

**Phase Parent Mode:** When a spec folder contains at least one direct child matching `^[0-9]{3}-[a-z0-9-]+$` AND that child has `spec.md` OR `description.json`, the validator treats the folder as a phase parent and ONLY requires `{spec.md, description.json, graph-metadata.json}` at the parent level. Heavy docs (`plan.md`, `tasks.md`, `checklist.md`, `decision-record.md`, `implementation-summary.md`) live in the phase children where they stay accurate to that phase's actual work. Detection rule: `is_phase_parent()` (shell) and `isPhaseParent()` (TS/JS) are the single source of truth — both must agree. **Content discipline:** the phase-parent `spec.md` must NOT narrate consolidation, merge, or migration history — it documents root purpose, sub-phase control file, and what needs done. Migration history goes in `context-index.md` if needed. Resume on a phase parent first follows a fresh `derived.last_active_child_id` pointer from `graph-metadata.json`; missing, null, stale, or `--no-redirect` cases list child phases with statuses (per `/speckit:resume` step 3b) so the user can pick which phase to continue. Tolerant policy: legacy phase parents that retain heavy docs continue to validate; soft-deprecation is a follow-on packet.

**Mandatory metadata:** Every spec folder (Level 1+) MUST contain `description.json` and `graph-metadata.json`. Both are auto-generated/refreshed by `generate-context.js` during canonical saves. `graph-metadata.json` stores lowercase derived status and falls back to `implementation-summary.md` presence plus checklist completion when explicit status is absent. If creating a spec folder manually or via template, run `generate-description.js` and the graph-metadata backfill to ensure both files exist. Spec folders without these files are invisible to memory search and graph traversal.

**Rules:** When in doubt → higher level. LOC is soft guidance (risk/complexity can override). Single typo/whitespace fixes (<5 characters in one file) are exempt.

**Spec folder path:** `.opencode/specs/[track]/[###-short-name]/` for tracked OpenCode packets, with phase children such as `[001-phase]/` under phase parents. Legacy/root `specs/[###-short-name]/` may exist, but current packet-local docs and metadata live under `.opencode/specs/`. | **Templates:** `.opencode/skills/system-spec-kit/templates/`

**Spec folder naming:** Phase children match `^[0-9]{3}-[a-z0-9-]+$` (3-digit prefix, lowercase, hyphens only). Before creating a new top-level packet, check it isn't really a phase child of an existing one: if its work is scoped to another packet, nest it under that parent, not as a track-root sibling. A top-level slug embedding a second packet's number (e.g. `028-026-foo`) is the should-have-been-a-phase-child smell; avoid generic root slugs (`-remediation`, `-cleanup`, `phase-N`). Prompt-time discipline only — `create.sh`/`validate.sh` enforce syntax, not location, and the Write tool bypasses `create.sh`.

## 4. 🧑‍🏫 CONFIDENCE & CLARIFICATION FRAMEWORK

#### Confidence Thresholds

| Confidence   | Action                                       |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| **≥80%**     | Proceed with citable source                  |
| **40-79%**   | Proceed with caveats                         |
| **<40%**     | Ask for clarification or mark "UNKNOWN"      |
| **Override** | Blockers/conflicts → ask regardless of score |

#### Logic-Sync Protocol

On contradiction (Spec vs Code, conflicting requirements) → HALT → Report "LOGIC-SYNC REQUIRED: [Fact A] contradicts [Fact B]" → Ask "Which truth prevails?"

#### Escalation

Confidence stays <80% after two failed attempts → ask with 2-3 options. Blockers beyond control → escalate with evidence and proposed next step.

## 5. 🤖 AGENT ROUTING

When using the orchestrate agent or Task tool for complex multi-step workflows, route to specialized agents:

### Runtime Agent Directory Resolution

Use the agent directory that matches the active runtime/provider profile:

| Runtime / Profile | Agent Directory     |
| ----------------- | ------------------- |
| **Opencode**      | `.opencode/agents/` |
| **Claude Code**   | `.claude/agents/`   |
| **Codex CLI**     | `.codex/agents/`    |

**Resolution rule:** pick one directory by runtime and stay consistent for that workflow phase.

### Agent Definitions

- **`@orchestrate`** - Multi-agent coordination, complex workflows
- **`@code`** - Application-code implementation specialist (LEAF, write-capable). Stack-aware via `sk-code` skill delegation; fail-closed verification. Dispatched ONLY by `@orchestrate` (orchestrator-only convention).
- **`@context`** - LEAF-only retrieval agent for codebase search, pattern discovery, and context loading. Uses memory triggers/context, memory search for spec docs, Code Graph + Grep for code discovery, and direct code evidence. LEAF: no sub-agent dispatch, no Task tool, no writes.
- **`@review`** - Code review, PRs, quality gates (READ-ONLY)
- **`@debug`** - Fresh perspective debugging (5-phase root-cause). Dispatched via Task tool; retains exclusive write access for `debug-delegation.md`
- **`@markdown`** - Template-first markdown/documentation executor (LEAF, write-capable). Handles `/create:*` commands, orchestrator-scoped spec-doc authoring, and any explicitly scoped markdown writing task with a resolved output path. Loads `sk-doc` on every invocation, reads the command-mapped or document-appropriate template before writing, and refuses only unscoped writes, path-ambiguous targets, or nested delegation. The Phase 0 gate is scope-based, not `/create:*`-only. Gate 3 still applies to writes unless the user or command contract has already supplied the answer.
- **`@prompt-improver`** - Prompt engineering via `sk-prompt`. Dispatched by `/prompt`
- **`@ai-council`** - Deep AI Council planning architect for multi-seat deliberation, strategy comparison, critique, convergence, and packet-local `ai-council/**` artifacts.
- **`@deep-research`** - Autonomous deep research iterations (LEAF). Dispatched by `/deep:start-research-loop`
- **`@deep-review`** - Autonomous deep review iterations (LEAF, P0/P1/P2). Dispatched by `/deep:start-review-loop`
- **`@deep-context`** - Autonomous codebase-context iterations (LEAF, read-only). Heterogeneous by-model parallel sweep over a shared scope; dispatched by `/deep:start-context-loop`
- **`@deep-improvement`** - Bounded agent improvement via `deep-improvement`. Dispatched by `/deep:start-agent-improvement-loop`

#### Distributed Governance Rule

- **Template + strict validate:** Any agent writing authored spec-folder docs (`spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, `checklist.md`, `implementation-summary.md`, `decision-record.md`, `handover.md`, `review-report.md`, `debug-delegation.md`, `resource-map.md`) MUST use templates from `.opencode/skills/system-spec-kit/templates/` and run `bash .opencode/skills/system-spec-kit/scripts/spec/validate.sh <spec-folder> --strict` after the write, before any completion claim.
- **Continuity updates:** route through `/memory:save`.
- **Deep-research exemption:** workflow-owned packet markdown (`research/iterations/*.md`, `research/deep-research-*.md`, progressive `research/research.md` updates) is exempt from the per-write strict-validate rule; `/deep:start-research-loop` instead runs targeted strict validation after every `spec.md` mutation it performs.
- **Exclusive write access:** `@deep-research` owns `research/research.md`; `@debug` owns `debug-delegation.md`.

## 6. ⚙️  MCP TOOL ROUTING

**Two systems:**

1. **Native MCP** (`opencode.json`) - Direct tools, called natively. **5 servers registered:**
   - Sequential Thinking
   - Spec Kit Memory (`mk-spec-memory`, 37 tools)
   - Skill Advisor (`mk_skill_advisor`, 9 tools — 4 advisor + 5 skill_graph)
   - Code Graph (`mk_code_index`, 8 tools)
   - Code Mode

2. **Code Mode MCP** (`.utcp_config.json`) - External tools via `call_tool_chain()`
   - Figma, Github, ClickUp, Chrome DevTools, etc.
   - Naming: `{manual_name}.{manual_name}_{tool_name}` (e.g., `clickup.clickup_get_teams({})`)

## 7. 🧩 SKILL ROUTING REFERENCE

Skills are specialized, on-demand support that provide domain expertise. Unlike knowledge files (passive references), skills are explicitly invoked to handle complex, multi-step workflows.

### How Skills Work

```
Task Received → Gate 2: Read hook brief, or run skill_advisor.py fallback
                    ↓
    Confidence ≥ 0.8 → MUST invoke recommended skill
                    ↓
     Invoke Skill → Read(".opencode/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md")
                    ↓
    Instructions Load → SKILL.md content + resource paths
                    ↓
      Follow Instructions → Complete task using skill guidance
```

### Skill Loading Protocol

1. Gate 2 provides skill recommendation via the Skill Advisor Hook, or via `skill_advisor.py` when the hook is unavailable.
2. Invoke using appropriate method for your environment
3. Read bundled resources from `references/`, `scripts/`, `assets/` paths
4. Follow skill instructions to completion
5. Do NOT re-invoke a skill already in context
