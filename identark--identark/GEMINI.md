# identark — Claude Code Instructions

See @README.md for project overview and @pyproject.toml for dependencies and build config.

## What This Project Is

identark implements the **AgentGateway Protocol (AGP)** — a credential isolation layer for
production AI agents. Agents never hold raw credentials. Every tool call routes through a gateway
that fetches credentials, executes, logs, and returns results. The agent only ever sees an agent ID.

This is both an open-source Python SDK and the foundation of identark-cloud (hosted SaaS).

## Build & Test Commands

```bash
# Install in dev mode
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Lint (MUST pass before any commit)
ruff check identark/ tests/

# Type check (MUST pass before any commit)
mypy identark/

# Run unit tests
pytest tests/unit/ -v --cov=identark --cov-report=term-missing

# Run all tests
pytest -v

# Build distribution
python -m build

# Format code
ruff format identark/ tests/
```

IMPORTANT: Always run `ruff check` and `mypy` after making changes. Never leave type errors unresolved.

## Architecture Rules — NEVER VIOLATE THESE

- **Agents NEVER hold raw credentials.** No API keys, tokens, or secrets in agent context, tool
  definitions, or environment variables accessible to the agent.
- **All tool calls go through a gateway.** DirectGateway for local dev, ControlPlaneGateway for cloud.
- **Every gateway execution produces an audit log entry.** Log: agent_id, tool, timestamp,
  success/failure, latency. Never log credential values, not even partially.
- **Credentials are fetched per-execution, never cached in memory across requests.**
- **Multi-tenant isolation is enforced at the gateway layer.** Agent A cannot access credentials
  registered under Agent B, even within the same organisation.

---

## Code Style

- Python 3.10+ only. Use `X | Y` union syntax, not `Optional[X]` or `Union[X, Y]`.
- All public functions and classes MUST have type annotations. mypy strict mode is enforced.
- Use Pydantic v2 models for all data structures (already a dependency via httpx).
- Async-first: all gateway operations are `async`. Provide sync wrappers only where explicitly needed.
- Exception hierarchy: all exceptions inherit from `IdentArkError` in `exceptions.py`.
- Use `httpx.AsyncClient` for all HTTP calls. Never use `requests`.
- Line length: 100 characters (configured in pyproject.toml).

---

## Security Requirements

- NEVER log, print, or include credential values in exceptions, error messages, or stack traces.
- NEVER store credentials in Pydantic model fields that could be serialised to JSON without
  explicit `exclude=True`.
- NEVER write tests that use real API keys. Use `MockGateway` or `pytest-mock`.
- If a function receives a credential value, it must be typed as `SecretStr`, not `str`.
- All credential storage in the cloud layer uses HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager.
  NEVER store credentials in PostgreSQL plaintext columns.

---

## Testing Conventions

- Every new gateway method needs a corresponding unit test in `tests/unit/test_gateways.py`.
- Use `MockGateway` from `identark.testing` for all tests that would otherwise need real credentials.
- Async tests use `pytest-asyncio` with `asyncio_mode = "auto"` (already configured).
- Test file naming: `test_<module>.py` mirroring the source path.
- Aim for >90% coverage on `identark/` core. Integrations can be lower.
- Mark integration tests with `@pytest.mark.integration` so CI can skip them:
  `pytest tests/unit/ -v` for CI, `pytest -v -m "not integration"` locally.

---

## Git & PR Conventions

- Branch naming: `feat/<name>`, `fix/<name>`, `chore/<name>`, `docs/<name>`
- Commit messages: conventional commits — `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, `test:`
- NEVER commit directly to `main`. All changes via PR.
- Run `ruff check` and `pytest tests/unit/` before every commit.
- Tag releases as `vX.Y.Z` — this triggers the PyPI publish workflow in CI.

---

## identark-cloud (Cloud Control Plane)

The hosted SaaS layer lives in `cloud/` (to be scaffolded). Stack:

- **API:** FastAPI, async, Python 3.11+
- **Database:** PostgreSQL via Supabase (SQLAlchemy 2.0 async ORM)
- **Credential vault:** HashiCorp Vault (self-hosted) or AWS Secrets Manager
- **Auth:** Supabase Auth (API key + JWT)
- **Billing:** Stripe (usage-based metering per gateway execution)
- **Deployment:** Fly.io (initial), multi-region later

Core endpoint to build first: `POST /v1/gateway/execute`
Request: `{ agent_id, tool, params, org_id }`
Response: `{ result, execution_id, latency_ms }`
Side effects: write audit log row, increment usage counter for billing.

Multi-tenancy model: every DB query scopes by `org_id`. Row-level security enforced at Postgres level
via Supabase RLS. An agent from org A cannot query credentials belonging to org B under any path.

---

## Adapters Build Order

1. **n8n** — custom node for n8n community registry (TypeScript/Node.js in `adapters/n8n/`)
2. **LangChain** — tool wrapper in `identark/integrations/langchain.py`
3. **CrewAI** — agent wrapper in `identark/integrations/crewai.py`
4. **LangGraph** — graph node binding in `identark/integrations/langgraph.py`

Each adapter must include: a working example in `examples/`, tests in `tests/unit/`, and
a section in `docs/adapters/<name>.md`.

---

## Common Gotchas

- `hatchling` is the build backend. Do not switch to setuptools or poetry.
- `asyncio_mode = "auto"` in pytest config means you do NOT need `@pytest.mark.asyncio` decorators.
- The `identark/py.typed` file must always exist — it marks the package as typed for mypy users.
- When adding a new public export, add it to `identark/__init__.py` AND document it in README.md.
- The PyPI publish workflow only triggers on `git tag v*` pushes, not on every main commit.
- `ruff` replaces both `flake8` and `isort`. Do not add either as a dependency.

---

## What NOT to Do

- Do not add `__all__` lists unless the module has >10 public exports.
- Do not use `print()` for debugging. Use `logging` with the `identark` logger namespace.
- Do not introduce new top-level dependencies without updating `pyproject.toml` and confirming
  with the project owner (Gold Okpa).
- Do not implement credential storage logic in the open-source SDK layer. That belongs in
  `identark-cloud` only.
- Do not write docstrings longer than 3 lines for internal functions.
