 ◈ Single-pass audit engine for Uniswap CCA
 ◈ 9 core vectors ∙ 6 integration vectors
```

When the user asks to scan for CCA vulnerabilities or run a CCA audit, follow this workflow against all `.sol` files in the project (excluding `test/`, `script/`, `lib/`).

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Read
Read all in-scope `.sol` files. Prioritize main contracts first, then libraries and interfaces.

### Step 2 — Triage
For each of the 14 vectors below (VC1-VC8 core, VI1-VI6 integration), classify as Skip / Borderline / Survive. Output all tiers.

### Step 3 — Deep Analysis
Only surviving vectors. Trace call chain from entry point to vulnerable line. Check all guards. Apply FP Gate. DROP if any check fails, CONFIRM if all pass.

### Step 4 — Adversarial Pass
Reason freely about the code beyond the checklist. Focus on: logic errors in clearing price computation, unsafe external interactions, access control gaps, economic exploits (MEV, sandwich), integration footguns (stale state reads), arithmetic edge cases (Q96 overflow), DoS vectors.

For integrations: What if a third party calls claimTokens first? What if CCA state changes between read and use? What if auction params are malicious? What if a searcher front/back-runs transactions?

**Silent misconfigurations** (no attacker required — missing validation that silently produces wrong results. Nothing reverts, nothing breaks. The math just quietly gives wrong answers for a class of inputs nobody rejects):
- No decimal floor check on auction token: tokens below 6 decimals lose significant value to Q96 rounding. A 2-decimal token can lose 90%+ per operation. Auction proceeds normally — just silently misallocates.
- No minimum tickSpacing enforcement: deploying with tiny tick spacing enables gas-exhaustion DoS on every checkpoint. CCA docs recommend "at least 1 basis point of floor price" — guidance only, not enforced on-chain.
- No minimum mps on final auction step: near-zero last-step issuance makes final clearing price trivially manipulable.
- No bounds on floorPrice relative to tick extremes: extreme values create auctions where math works but economics are broken.

### Step 5 — Report
Summary header (files, lines, finding count by severity), then findings sorted by confidence.

## Core Vectors (CCA's own code)

**VC1 — TICK-ITERATION-DOS**: _iterateOverTicksAndFindClearingPrice walks linked list of ticks per checkpoint. Attacker initializes thousands at minimum spacing → gas exhaustion on every submitBid. CONFIRM IF: no gas-bounded exit or no minimum tick spacing.

**VC2 — PRORATA-MEV**: Clearing tick fills pro-rata via on-chain accumulators. Searcher front-runs to dilute, back-runs exitPartiallyFilledBid same block. Flashloan-composable. CONFIRM IF: no anti-dilution and same-block exit allowed.

**VC3 — STEP-TAIL-MANIPULATION**: Final clearingPrice seeds v4 pool. Tiny last-step mps = almost no supply anchors price. Single bid near END_BLOCK shifts pool opening. CONFIRM IF: no minimum mps enforcement on final step.

**VC4 — DIRECT-TRANSFER-LOSS**: sweep functions use accounted values not balanceOf. Direct transfers permanently lost. CONFIRM IF: sweep uses accounted values.

**VC5 — OVERFLOW-BOUNDS**: TOTAL_SUPPLY * nextActiveTickPrice_ can approach uint256 max. Guard may fire late. CONFIRM IF: product can overflow before guard.

**VC6 — LOWDEC-FOT-SILENT-MISALLOCATION**: <6 decimal tokens silently misallocate (Q96 rounding loss). Fee-on-transfer tokens drift accounting. The bug is the ABSENCE of validation — the auction creation path accepts any token without checking decimals. CONFIRM IF: no decimal floor check in constructor/factory OR no balanceOf-delta verification on transfers. Either alone is sufficient.

**VC7 — PERMISSIONLESS-CLAIM-ZEROING**: claimTokens() permissionless, zeros tokensFilled permanently. #1 integration bug source. CONFIRM IF: no access control on claimTokens.

**VC8 — BID-LOCK-V1**: v1.0.0 factory (0x0000ccaDF55C911a2FbC0BB9d2942Aa77c6FAa1D) locks bids. CONFIRM IF: v1.0.0 address in codebase.

**VC9 — TSTORE-POISON**: Solidity compiler bug (0.8.28–0.8.33, --via-ir). Compiler caches storageSetToZeroFunction by type name without distinguishing sstore vs tstore. Contract with both persistent + transient variable of same type where both are deleted → first delete poisons cache, wrong opcode for all subsequent deletes. Persistent delete may tstore (value returns next tx), transient delete may sstore (nukes persistent slot). Array element clearing widens collision surface. CCA forks upgrading from 0.8.26 and integration contracts built on CCA using 0.8.28+ are directly exposed. CONFIRM IF: pragma 0.8.28–0.8.33 AND transient + persistent same type AND both deleted AND --via-ir.

## Integration Vectors (code that uses CCA)

**VI1 — STALE-TOKENSFILLED-READ**: Reading tokensFilled post-claim → zero. Griefing bot front-runs claimTokens. CONFIRM IF: reads tokensFilled after claim window without caching.

**VI2 — UNSAFE-AUCTION-DEPLOYMENT**: Deploying auctions without validating params (floorPrice, requiredCurrencyRaised, positionRecipient, tickSpacing, mps). CONFIRM IF: no parameter bounds enforcement.

**VI3 — DIRECT-CURRENCY-TRANSFER**: Sending funds via ERC20 transfer instead of submitBid/onTokensReceived. Permanently lost. CONFIRM IF: any transfer to CCA outside correct paths.

**VI4 — FILL-AMOUNT-STABILITY-ASSUMPTION**: Assuming fill amounts are stable — they change every block at clearing tick. CONFIRM IF: uses fill amounts without snapshot.

**VI5 — PARAM-HONEYPOT-EXPOSURE**: Letting users interact with arbitrary auctions without param validation. CONFIRM IF: accepts auction address without checking params.

**VI6 — VERSION-MISMATCH**: References v1.0.0 factory. CONFIRM IF: v1.0.0 address in source.

## FP Gate

ALL three must pass or DROP:
1. **Concrete path**: Trace specific transactions entry→harm. For missing-validation bugs, path can be: unsafe deployment → normal usage → silent wrong result. Name functions.
2. **Reachable**: Past all guards? If fully guarded → DROP.
3. **Impact**: Users lose funds, attacker profits, or core invariant broken? Inconvenience only → DROP.
