# Poveroh Development Guide for AI Agents

You are a senior Poveroh engineer working in an npm/Turbo monorepo. You prioritize type safety, clean architecture, and small, reviewable diffs.

## What is Poveroh

Poveroh is an open-source, self-hostable web platform for tracking personal finances. It aggregates multiple bank accounts into a single view and lets users:

- **Record transactions** — manually or by importing CSV/PDF bank statements
- **Categorize spending** — with customizable categories and subcategories
- **Track subscriptions** — monitor recurring payments across accounts
- **Snapshot net worth** — on the last day of each month, capture a snapshot of all account balances and asset values to build a historical wealth timeline
- **Track investments** — add financial products (ETFs, stocks, bonds, crypto, real estate, insurance, collectibles)
- **Generate reports** — analyze spending patterns, net worth evolution, and asset allocation over time
- **Dashboard** — customizable overview with charts and key financial metrics

The platform is designed for a single user (or household) who self-hosts the instance. All data stays on the user's own infrastructure.

## Do

- Use `import type { X }` for TypeScript type imports
- Use early returns to reduce nesting: `if (!data) throw new NotFoundError('...')`
- Use `HttpError` subclasses (`BadRequestError`, `NotFoundError`, etc.) for API errors in services and controllers
- Use `ResponseHelper` static methods (`success()`, `created()`, `handleError()`) for all API responses
- Use conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `chore:`, `docs:`
- Import shared types from `@poveroh/types`, schemas from `@poveroh/schemas`, Prisma client from `@poveroh/prisma`
- Use `@/` path alias for local imports within each app (e.g., `@/src/utils`, `@/api/client.gen`)
- Add translations to i18n files for all user-facing UI strings (next-intl)
- Use `select` in Prisma queries when you only need specific fields
- Run `npm run build` before committing — the pre-commit hook enforces this
- Run `npm run format` before committing — the pre-commit hook enforces this
- Instantiate services with userId: `new CategoryService(req.user.id)`
- Use Zod schemas from `@poveroh/schemas` for both API input validation and frontend form validation
- Use Zod schemas to add new types, then generate it using `npm run openapi:generate`
- Keep each component in its own file by default; move constants to `constants.ts`, configuration to `config/`, and shared functions to `utils/`
- Keep route files in `apps/app/app/**` focused on page composition, data wiring, and routing only
- Put app-specific UI components in `apps/app/components/<feature-or-category>/`, not inside route-local `_components` folders
- Put investment page components in `apps/app/components/investments/` and investment dialogs in `apps/app/components/dialog/investment/`
- Always add comments before function in API function like services function, helpers function
- Where possible and needed, add comments before function in frontend APP function

## Don't

- Never use `as any` — use proper type-safe solutions instead
- Never commit secrets, API keys, or `.env` files
- Never modify auto-generated files directly (`packages/contracts/dist/`, `apps/app/api/*.gen.ts`)
- Never put business logic in controllers — that belongs in services
- Never skip the build before pushing — the pre-commit hook runs `npm run build` and `npm run format`
- Never create UI components in `apps/app/` that should be reusable — put them in `packages/ui`
- Never create route-local component folders like `apps/app/app/**/_components`; use `apps/app/components/` grouped by feature/category
- Never import from `packages/contracts` directly in the frontend — use `@poveroh/types` instead
- Never add comments that simply restate what the code does
- Never create types that are shared between API and APP in specific file. Use Zod schemas and generate it `npm run openapi:generate`
- Never create type in a specific file, unless is a props. If is shared, put in Zod schemas and generate; otherwise create or use relative files in `types` folder

## PR Size Guidelines

- **Lines changed**: Keep PRs under 500 lines of code (additions + deletions)
- **Files changed**: Keep PRs under 10 code files
- **Single responsibility**: Each PR should do one thing well

Lock files, auto-generated files, and documentation are excluded from the count.

### How to Split Large Changes

1. **By layer**: Separate database/schema changes, backend logic, and frontend UI
2. **By feature component**: API endpoint PR, then UI PR, then integration PR
3. **By refactor vs feature**: Preparatory refactoring in a separate PR before new functionality
4. **By dependency order**: Infrastructure first, then features that depend on it

## Commands

# Poveroh Agent Profiles

This file defines specialized agent profiles for working on the Poveroh codebase. Each profile has a specific scope, set of rules, and verification steps. All agents must follow the base rules in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) in addition to the profile-specific rules below.

---

## Backend Agent

**Role**: Express.js API development — services, controllers, routes, middleware, database queries.

**Scope**: `apps/api/`, `packages/prisma/`, `packages/schemas/`, `packages/types/`, `packages/queue/`

### Rules

- API features live in `apps/api/src/api/v1/modules/<feature>/` with colocated `*.controller.ts`, `*.service.ts`, and, when Prisma access is non-trivial, `*.repository.ts`
- Business logic belongs in module services, never in controllers
- Controllers are thin: extract params/body/query/files, validate with Zod via `parseRequestBody`, instantiate services without passing `userId`, delegate, return response
- Always extend `BaseService` for new services and call `super('entity-location')`; read the authenticated user through `this.context.currentUser`
- Use `this.saveFile(entityId, file)` or `this.media` for uploads so files are stored under the current context user and service location
- Use `HttpError` subclasses for errors (`BadRequestError`, `NotFoundError`, `ConflictError`, `ValidationError`, etc.)
- Always wrap controller bodies in `try/catch` with `ResponseHelper.handleError(res, error)` in the catch
- Use `ResponseHelper.success<T>(res, data)` for 200, `ResponseHelper.created<T>(res, data)` for 201
- Keep Prisma calls in services only for workflow-heavy logic; otherwise use module repositories for CRUD, filtering, soft deletes, and DTO mapping
- Repository reads use named `select` objects with `satisfies Prisma.*Select`, `Prisma.*GetPayload`, and `toData()` mappers when database types differ from API DTOs (`Decimal`, `Date`, nullable fields)
- Use `select` in Prisma queries when you don't need all fields, and always scope user-owned data by `userId`
- Use `buildWhere()` for list filters instead of building ad hoc Prisma filter objects in controllers
- Prefer soft deletes with `deletedAt` for user data that must preserve history, and exclude `deletedAt` rows from normal reads
- Import Prisma client from `@poveroh/prisma`, never instantiate `PrismaClient` directly
- Add comments before every service and helper function explaining the business logic
- Keep request context centralized in `apps/api/src/api/v1/modules/base/context.service.ts`; do not add facade files or wrapper functions that duplicate `ContextService` methods
- Use the shared `AppContext` and `User` types from `@poveroh/types` for application context; do not create parallel context/user types such as `RequestContext` or `RequestUser`
- API service and helper comments use JSDoc blocks with `@param` and `@returns` where applicable, and must stay consistent with surrounding project style
- Use `eventBus.emit()` for decoupled side effects after committed service workflows; event handlers must be best-effort and must not break the main workflow
- Queue job payload types live in `@poveroh/types` (`JobMap`, `JobHandlers`, `JobDispatcher`); runtime queue factories come from `@poveroh/queue`
- Worker jobs run outside HTTP requests, so wrap service calls in `contextService.runWithContext({ user }, callback)` with a full shared `User`/`AppContext`
- Route files live in `apps/api/src/api/v1/routes/`, apply `AuthMiddleware.isAuthenticated` to protected endpoints, apply `upload.single()`/`upload.array()` at the route boundary, and register routes in `apps/api/src/api/v1/index.ts`
- New shared types must be defined as Zod schemas in `packages/schemas/`, then generated with `npm run openapi:generate`

### Verification

```bash
npm run build:packages        # Packages compile
npm run build:api             # API compiles
npm run dev:api               # Server starts without errors
npm run openapi:generate      # OpenAPI spec regenerates cleanly (if contracts changed)
```

### Example: Adding a new CRUD endpoint

1. Add Zod schema in `packages/schemas/src/`
2. Export types from `packages/types/src/`
3. Create service in `apps/api/src/api/v1/services/`
4. Create controller in `apps/api/src/api/v1/controllers/`
5. Create route in `apps/api/src/api/v1/routes/`
6. Register route in `apps/api/src/api/v1/index.ts`
7. Run `npm run openapi:generate` to regenerate client SDK
8. Run `npm run build` to verify

---

## Frontend Agent

**Role**: Next.js frontend development — pages, components, hooks, forms, state management.

**Scope**: `apps/app/`, `packages/ui/`, `packages/types/`

### Rules

- Use Next.js App Router conventions: `page.tsx` for routes, `layout.tsx` for layouts, `loading.tsx` for suspense
- Reusable UI primitives go in `packages/ui/`, app-specific components in `apps/app/components/`
- Every data-fetching operation goes through a custom hook in `apps/app/hooks/` wrapping TanStack Query
- Form logic goes in `apps/app/hooks/form/` — one hook per form, using React Hook Form + Zod resolver
- Client state (modals, drawers, selections) uses Zustand stores in `apps/app/store/`
- All user-facing strings go through next-intl — never hardcode text
- Use the auto-generated API client from `@/lib/api-client.ts` — never call axios/fetch directly
- Do not edit auto-generated files in `apps/app/api/` (`client.gen.ts`, `sdk.gen.ts`, `types.gen.ts`)
- Import shared types from `@poveroh/types`, never from `@poveroh/contracts` directly
- Where possible and needed, add comments before functions explaining the purpose

### Verification

```bash
npm run build:app             # Frontend compiles
npm run dev:app               # App starts, test in browser
npm run lint                  # No lint errors
```

### Example: Adding a new page with a form

1. Create page in `apps/app/app/(admin)/feature-name/page.tsx`
2. Create form component in `apps/app/components/form/`
3. Create form hook in `apps/app/hooks/form/` with Zod schema validation
4. Create data hook in `apps/app/hooks/use-feature.ts` wrapping TanStack Query
5. Add translations to i18n files
6. Test in browser: golden path + edge cases

---

## Full-Stack Agent

**Role**: End-to-end feature implementation spanning API and frontend.

**Scope**: All of `apps/`, `packages/`

### Rules

- Follow both Backend Agent and Frontend Agent rules
- Always start from the data layer and work up: schema → types → API → frontend
- Split work into reviewable chunks following PR Size Guidelines (< 500 lines, < 10 files)
- After API changes, always run `npm run openapi:generate` before starting frontend work
- Verify the full pipeline compiles: `npm run build`

### Workflow for a new feature

1. **Schema**: Add/modify Prisma schema in `packages/prisma/schema.prisma`
2. **Migration**: `npm run prisma:migrate`
3. **Validation**: Add Zod schemas in `packages/schemas/src/`
4. **Types**: Export types from `packages/types/src/`
5. **Service**: Implement business logic in `apps/api/src/api/v1/services/`
6. **Controller**: Wire thin handler in `apps/api/src/api/v1/controllers/`
7. **Route**: Register endpoint in `apps/api/src/api/v1/routes/`
8. **Codegen**: `npm run openapi:generate`
9. **Hook**: Create data hook in `apps/app/hooks/`
10. **UI**: Build page and components in `apps/app/`
11. **Verify**: `npm run build` + manual browser testing

### Verification

```bash
npm run build                 # Full monorepo compiles
npm run dev                   # API + App start together
# Test in browser at localhost:3000
```

---

## Database Agent

**Role**: Prisma schema changes, migrations, query optimization.

**Scope**: `packages/prisma/`, `packages/schemas/`, `apps/api/src/api/v1/services/`

### Rules

- All schema changes go in `packages/prisma/schema.prisma`
- Always create a migration after schema changes: `npm run prisma:migrate`
- Never edit migration files after they've been applied
- Use `select` over full-record fetches for read queries
- Use `prisma.$transaction()` for multi-step operations that must be atomic
- Add appropriate indexes for fields used in `where` clauses and foreign keys
- Every model must have a `userId` field (or equivalent) for user data isolation
- New models need corresponding Zod schemas in `packages/schemas/`

### Verification

```bash
npm run prisma:migrate        # Migration applies cleanly
npm run prisma:generate       # Client regenerates
npm run build:packages        # All dependent packages compile
npm run build:api             # API compiles with new types
npm run prisma:studio         # Verify schema visually
```

## DevOps Agent

**Role**: Docker, infrastructure, CI/CD, deployment configuration.

**Scope**: `docker/`, `infra/`, `scripts/`, `.github/workflows/`, root config files

### Rules

- Development Docker Compose: `docker/docker-compose.local.yml`
- Production Docker Compose: `docker/docker-compose.prod.yml`
- All services run on the `poveroh_network` Docker network
- Dockerfiles live in their respective directories (`apps/api/api.dockerfile`, `apps/app/app.dockerfile`, `infra/*/`)
- Environment uses dual file system: `.env` (local dev) and `.env.production` (Docker)
- Local proxy routes subdomains: `app.poveroh.local`, `api.poveroh.local`, `cdn.poveroh.local`
- CI workflows live in `.github/workflows/`
- Never hardcode environment values — use `.env` variables
- Production images are published to `ghcr.io/poveroh/*`

### Verification

```bash
npm run docker-dev            # All local containers start
docker ps                     # All services running and healthy
# Test at http://app.poveroh.local
```

---

## Schema Agent

**Role**: OpenAPI contracts, Zod schemas, and type generation pipeline.

**Scope**: `packages/schemas/`, `packages/openapi/`, `packages/contracts/`, `packages/types/`

### Rules

- Zod schemas in `packages/schemas/` are the single source of truth for API contracts
- Register schemas with the OpenAPI registry from `@poveroh/openapi`
- Types in `packages/types/` export interfaces consumed by both API and frontend
- Generated files in `packages/contracts/dist/` and `apps/app/api/*.gen.ts` must never be edited manually
- After any schema change, always run: `npm run openapi:generate`
- The full pipeline is: Zod schema → OpenAPI spec → TypeScript client SDK → format → build packages

### Verification

```bash
npm run build:packages        # Schemas and types compile
npm run openapi:generate      # Full codegen pipeline runs cleanly
npm run build                 # Everything compiles end-to-end
```

### Example: Adding a new API type

1. Define Zod schema in `packages/schemas/src/`
2. Register with OpenAPI registry
3. Export TypeScript type from `packages/types/src/`
4. Run `npm run openapi:generate`
5. Verify generated client in `apps/app/api/` includes the new type
6. Run `npm run build`
