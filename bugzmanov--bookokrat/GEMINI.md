# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## CRITICAL RULES FOR AI ASSISTANTS

0. **Working Directory**: NEVER CHANGE WORKING DIRECTORY UNLESS SPECIFICALLY ASKED. THE CURRENT USER WORKFLOW IS BASED ON WORKTREES, BY RECKLESSLY CHANGING DIRECTORIES YOU CAN MAKE IRREVERSIBLE DAMAGE.

1. **Testing**: ALWAYS use the existing SVG-based snapshot testing in `tests/svg_snapshots.rs`. NEVER introduce new testing frameworks or approaches.
1a. **Sandbox-Safe Tests**: All tests must run in sandboxed environments (e.g., Nix builds). This means tests MUST NOT: rely on a writable home directory or system directories (`dirs::data_dir()`, `dirs::cache_dir()`, etc.); make network requests; depend on system fonts, a real TTY, or specific environment variables (`TERM`, `COLORTERM`, `TERM_PROGRAM`); assume standard tools exist in `PATH` beyond what's declared as dependencies. Use `tempfile::TempDir` for any filesystem operations, and inject/mock any external dependencies rather than relying on the host environment.
2. **Golden Snapshots**: NEVER update golden snapshot files with `SNAPSHOTS=overwrite` unless explicitly requested by the user. This is critical for test integrity.
3. **Test Updates**: NEVER update any test files or test expectations unless explicitly requested by the user. This includes unit tests, integration tests, and snapshot tests.
4. **File Creation**: Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones. Only create new files when absolutely necessary.
5. **Code Formatting**: NEVER manually reformat code or change indentation/line breaks. ONLY use `cargo fmt` for all formatting. When editing code, preserve the existing formatting exactly and let `cargo fmt` handle any formatting changes.
6. **Final Formatting**: ALWAYS run `cargo fmt` before reporting task completion if any code changes were made. This ensures consistent code formatting and prevents formatting-related changes in future edits.
7. **Comments/Annotations**: NEVER modify the comment storage format or location (`.bookokrat_comments/`) without explicit user request. The YAML-based persistence is critical.
8. **ANSI Art**: The `readme.ans` file contains binary CP437-encoded art. NEVER modify this file.
9. **Vendored Code**: The `src/vendored/` directory contains vendored ratatui-image code. This is NOT a crates.io dependency - it's vendored for customization.
10. **Kitty Graphics Protocol**: For Kitty terminals, ALWAYS use SHM (shared memory) transmission for images. NEVER use base64/direct transmission - it's too slow for 60fps PDF rendering.
11. **Backward Compatibility for Persistent Data**: When modifying any persistent data structures (bookmarks, settings, comments, or any files stored on the user's machine), ALWAYS ensure backward compatibility:
    - New fields in serialized structs MUST be `Option<T>` with `#[serde(skip_serializing_if = "Option::is_none")]` or have `#[serde(default)]`
    - Old app versions must be able to read new data files (serde ignores unknown fields by default - do NOT add `deny_unknown_fields`)
    - New app versions must be able to read old data files (missing fields default to `None` or sensible defaults)
    - If a breaking change is unavoidable, ASK the user how to design a migration path before implementing
    - Test both directions: old data → new app, and consider new data → old app
12. **Settings File Preservation**: The config file (`config.yaml`) uses a **targeted update** approach to preserve user edits. Key rules:
    - `save_settings_to_file()` reads the existing file and only updates **app-managed keys** in-place (version, theme, margin, pdf_*, book_sort_order). All comments, blank lines, and user-managed sections are preserved untouched.
    - `generate_settings_yaml()` is only used for **brand new config files** (first launch). It includes template comments for lookup_command and custom_themes.
    - **App-managed keys** (updated programmatically): `version`, `theme`, `margin`, `transparent_background`, `pdf_scale`, `pdf_pan_shift`, `pdf_render_mode`, `pdf_enabled`, `pdf_settings_configured`, `book_sort_order`
    - **User-managed keys** (only edited by hand in YAML): `lookup_command`, `lookup_display`, `custom_themes` — the app reads but never writes these
    - When adding a new setting: if it's app-managed, add it to `app_managed_key_values()`. If it's user-managed, only add it to `generate_settings_yaml()` (for new files) and to `migrate_settings()` (to append template for upgrading users).
    - **Migrations** (`migrate_settings()`) receive the file content as `&str` and return modified content. Insert new template sections at the correct position relative to existing sections (e.g., before custom_themes). The targeted update then writes the version bump on top.
    - NEVER regenerate the entire config file on save — this destroys user comments and formatting
13. **VHS Test Tapes and Keyboard Shortcuts**: When changing keyboard shortcut mappings, ALWAYS check and update all VHS test tapes in `vhs_tests/tapes/` to use the new keybindings. Test tapes simulate user input, so outdated keybindings will cause test failures.
14. **Keybindings Architecture**: ALL keyboard shortcuts go through the configurable keybinding system in `src/keybindings/`. NEVER hardcode key-to-action mappings in match arms. See the "Configurable Keybindings" section below for the full workflow.

## Core Principles

**This is NOT a toy project.** Bookokrat aims to replace GUI PDF/EPUB readers with a terminal-based alternative that is equally usable or better.

### Two Main Pillars

1. **User Experience**
   - Every user interaction must feel polished and intentional
   - No hacks, workarounds, or shortcuts for UX issues
   - If something doesn't work correctly, fix it properly - don't paper over it
   - The application should "just work" - users should never need to perform extra actions to trigger proper rendering or behavior
   - Visual feedback must be immediate and accurate

2. **Performance**
   - 60fps rendering is the target, not a nice-to-have
   - Background operations must never block the UI
   - Memory and CPU usage should be minimal
   - Startup time should be fast
   - Page navigation and scrolling must be instant

### Quality Standards

- **UX bugs are critical bugs** - treat them with the same urgency as crashes
- **Never accept "good enough"** - if a GUI app does something better, match or exceed it
- **Test on real hardware** - VHS visual tests exist to catch rendering issues across terminals
- **Responsiveness matters** - perceived performance is as important as actual performance

### Content Processing Pipeline

**Modern HTML5ever-based Pipeline (default):**
1. EPUB file is opened and validated
2. Images are extracted and cached to `temp_images/` directory
3. Table of contents is parsed from NCX or Nav documents
4. Chapter HTML content is extracted via epub crate
5. HTML is parsed using html5ever into proper DOM structure
6. DOM is converted to clean Markdown AST with preserved formatting
7. MathML elements are converted to ASCII art using mathml_renderer
8. Markdown AST is rendered to formatted text output
9. HTML entities are decoded in the final text
10. Images are loaded asynchronously in background

**Legacy Regex-based Pipeline (available as fallback):**
1. EPUB file is opened and validated
2. Images are extracted and cached to `temp_images/` directory
3. Table of contents is parsed from NCX or Nav documents
4. Chapter HTML content is extracted via epub crate
5. Chapter title is extracted from h1/h2/title tags
6. HTML is cleaned using regex (scripts, styles removed)
7. HTML entities are decoded
8. Code blocks are detected and preserved with syntax highlighting
9. Tables are parsed and formatted for terminal display
10. Image tags are replaced with placeholders
11. Links are extracted and formatted
12. Tags are converted to text formatting
13. Paragraphs are indented for readability
14. Text is wrapped to terminal width
15. Images are loaded asynchronously in background

**Text Generator Selection:**
The application primarily uses the Markdown AST-based pipeline through MarkdownTextReader for rendering, with html_to_markdown.rs handling the HTML to AST conversion.

## Configurable Keybindings

**CRITICAL: All keyboard shortcuts go through the keybinding system.** Never hardcode key-to-action mappings in match arms. The system lives in `src/keybindings/` and uses neovim-compatible key notation.

### Module Structure

```
src/keybindings/
    mod.rs          Global Keymap singleton (LazyLock<RwLock<Keymap>>)
    notation.rs     Neovim key notation parser/formatter (<C-d>, gg, <Space>f, etc.)
    action.rs       Action enum (~85 variants, serde snake_case)
    context.rs      KeyContext enum (12 contexts) + group hierarchy
    keymap.rs       Trie-based ContextKeymap, Keymap, LookupResult
    defaults.rs     Default bindings defined in layers
    config.rs       YAML config loading from ~/.config/bookokrat/keybindings.yaml
```

### Context Hierarchy and Layers

Defaults are built from layers applied in order (later overrides earlier):

```
Layer 1: "all"    → shared vim nav (j/k, gg/G, C-d/u/f/b, arrows, Esc)
                    Applied to every context EXCEPT Global.

Layer 2: "normal" → vim cursor motions (h/l, w/b/e, 0/^/$, f/F/t/T, ;, v/V, y, n)
                    Applied to EpubNormal + PdfNormal.

Layer 3: "popup"  → (currently empty, reserved for future shared popup bindings)
                    Applied to all popup contexts.

Layer 4: per-context specifics override layers above.
```

Contexts:
- `Global` — space-prefixed commands, Ctrl+Z/Q/L/S, `?`, `<`/`>` (standalone, no layer inheritance)
- `Navigation` — book list / TOC panel
- `EpubContent` — EPUB reader scrolling mode (overrides j/k to ScrollDown/Up, h/l to chapter nav)
- `EpubNormal` — EPUB vim normal/visual mode
- `PdfStandard` — PDF reader standard mode (overrides j/k to ScrollDown/Up, h/l to page nav)
- `PdfNormal` — PDF vim normal mode
- `PopupHelp`, `PopupHistory`, `PopupSearch`, `PopupStats`, `PopupComments`, `PopupSettings`

### How to Add a New Keyboard Shortcut

**Step 1: Add the Action variant** to `src/keybindings/action.rs`:
```rust
#[serde(rename_all = "snake_case")]
pub enum Action {
    // ...
    MyNewAction,  // will be "my_new_action" in YAML config
}
```

**Step 2: Add the default binding** to `src/keybindings/defaults.rs`:
- If the binding applies to a single context, add it in that context's `_specifics()` function.
- If it applies to all contexts, add it in `add_all_layer()`.
- If it applies to normal modes only, add it in `add_normal_layer()`.
- **Check for collisions**: the same key in the same context will overwrite. Run `cargo test --lib keybindings` to verify no existing tests break.

```rust
fn content_specifics(keymap: &mut Keymap) {
    let ctx = keymap.context_mut(KeyContext::EpubContent);
    // ...
    bind!(ctx, "x" => Action::MyNewAction);
}
```

**Step 3: Handle the action in the dispatch method** for the relevant context:
- `dispatch_global_action()` in `main_app.rs` for Global
- `dispatch_nav_action()` in `navigation_panel/mod.rs` for Navigation
- `dispatch_epub_content_action()` in `main_app.rs` for EpubContent
- `dispatch_epub_normal_action()` in `main_app.rs` for EpubNormal
- `dispatch_pdf_standard_action()` in `pdf_reader/navigation.rs` for PdfStandard
- `dispatch_pdf_normal_action()` in `pdf_reader/navigation.rs` for PdfNormal
- Inline match in each popup's `handle_key()` for popup contexts

```rust
Action::MyNewAction => {
    self.do_the_thing();
    true  // or None for popup handlers
}
```

**Step 4: Add a test** in `defaults.rs`:
```rust
#[test]
fn my_new_binding() {
    let keymap = default_keymap();
    assert_eq!(
        lookup(&keymap, KeyContext::EpubContent, "x"),
        LookupResult::Found(Action::MyNewAction)
    );
}
```

### Key Notation (Neovim-Compatible)

| Notation | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `j`, `G`, `?` | Single character |
| `<C-d>` | Ctrl+d |
| `<A-x>` / `<M-x>` | Alt+x |
| `<S-Tab>` | Shift+Tab |
| `<CR>` / `<Enter>` | Enter |
| `<Esc>`, `<Tab>`, `<BS>`, `<Del>` | Special keys |
| `<Space>` | Space |
| `<lt>`, `<gt>` | Literal `<` and `>` |
| `gg` | Sequence: g then g |
| `<Space>f` | Sequence: space then f |

### Dispatch Pattern

Every key handler follows this pattern:

```rust
// 1. Text input guards (search input, comment editing) — bypass keymap
if self.is_text_input_active() { return handle_text_input(key); }

// 2. Pending states (f/F/t/T char, yank motion, visual text object) — bypass keymap
if self.has_pending_state() { return handle_pending(key); }

// 3. Keymap lookup
let input = key_event_to_input(&key);
let km = crate::keybindings::keymap();
let mut keys: Vec<_> = key_seq.keys().iter().map(key_event_to_input).collect();
keys.push(input);

match km.lookup(context, &keys) {
    LookupResult::Found(action) => { key_seq.clear(); dispatch(action) }
    LookupResult::Prefix => { key_seq.push(key); /* wait */ }
    LookupResult::NoMatch => { key_seq.clear(); /* unhandled */ }
}
```

Key rules:
- **Text input modes MUST bypass the keymap.** Comment editing, search input, go-to-page input, export filename input — these consume raw characters.
- **Pending vim states bypass the keymap.** After pressing `f`, the next character is consumed by the find-char motion, not looked up in the keymap.
- **Count prefixes bypass the keymap.** `5j` = count 5 + action j. The digit accumulation happens before keymap lookup.
- **The keymap is stateless.** `KeySeq` (in `src/inputs/key_seq.rs`) manages the 1-second timeout and sequence accumulation. The keymap just does a trie lookup on whatever keys are accumulated.
- **Global context is checked first.** `handle_global_hotkeys()` runs before context-specific handlers. If it returns true, the key is consumed.
- **Actions with runtime conditions** (e.g., `ToggleNormalMode` redirects to `next_search_match` when search is active) handle the condition in the dispatch, not in the keymap.

### User Config File

Path: `~/.config/bookokrat/keybindings.yaml`

Only overrides need to be specified. Groups (`all`, `normal`, `popup`) apply to multiple contexts. Specific contexts override groups.

```yaml
all:
  "<C-n>": move_down          # adds to every context except global

content:
  "j": scroll_up              # override in EPUB content only
  "p": nop                    # disable a binding

normal:
  "<C-w>": word_forward       # both epub_normal + pdf_normal

popup:
  "q": cancel                 # close any popup with q
```

Config keys for specific contexts: `global`, `nav`, `content`, `epub_normal`, `pdf`, `pdf_normal`, `popup.help`, `popup.history`, `popup.search`, `popup.stats`, `popup.comments`, `popup.settings`.

## Snapshot Testing

**IMPORTANT FOR AI ASSISTANTS:**
1. **ALWAYS use SVG-based snapshot tests** - All UI tests MUST use the existing SVG snapshot testing infrastructure in `tests/svg_snapshots.rs`. DO NOT introduce any new testing approaches or frameworks.
2. **NEVER update golden snapshots without explicit permission** - Golden snapshot files in `tests/snapshots/` should NEVER be updated with `SNAPSHOTS=overwrite` unless the user explicitly asks for it. This is critical for maintaining test integrity.

BookRat uses visual snapshot testing for its terminal UI to ensure the rendering remains consistent across changes.

### Running Snapshot Tests

```bash
# Run snapshot tests
cargo test --test svg_snapshots

# Run with automatic browser report opening
OPEN_REPORT=1 cargo test --test svg_snapshots
```

### When Tests Fail

When snapshot tests fail, the system generates a comprehensive HTML report showing:
- Side-by-side visual comparison (Expected vs Actual)
- Line statistics and diff information
- Buttons to copy update commands to clipboard

The report is saved to: `target/test-reports/svg_snapshot_report.html`

### Updating Snapshots

After reviewing the visual differences, you can update snapshots in two ways:

1. **Update individual test**: Click "📋 Copy Update Command" button in the report
   ```bash
   SNAPSHOTS=overwrite cargo test test_file_list_svg
   ```

2. **Update all snapshots**: Click "📋 Copy Update All Command" button
   ```bash
   SNAPSHOTS=overwrite cargo test --test svg_snapshots
   ```

The `SNAPSHOTS=overwrite` environment variable tells snapbox to update the snapshot files with the current test output instead of failing when differences are found.

### Test Architecture

The snapshot testing system consists of:

1. **svg_snapshots.rs** - Main test file that renders the TUI and captures SVG output. ALL NEW UI TESTS MUST BE ADDED HERE.
2. **snapshot_assertions.rs** - Custom assertion function that compares snapshots
3. **test_report.rs** - Generates the HTML visual diff report
4. **visual_diff.rs** - Creates visual comparisons (no longer used directly)

When adding new tests:
- Add them to `tests/svg_snapshots.rs` following the existing pattern
- Use `terminal_to_svg()` to convert terminal output to SVG
- Use `assert_svg_snapshot()` for assertions
- Never create new test files or testing approaches

### Working with New Snapshot Tests

**CRITICAL FOR AI ASSISTANTS:**
When adding a new snapshot test, it is **expected and normal** for the test to fail initially because there is no saved golden snapshot file yet. This is not an error - it's the intended workflow.

**Key Points:**
1. **Test failure is expected** - New snapshot tests will always fail on first run since no golden snapshot exists
2. **Focus on the generated snapshot** - When a new test fails, examine the debug SVG file (e.g., `tests/snapshots/debug_test_name.svg`) to verify it shows what the test scenario should display
3. **Analyze the visual output** - Check that the generated snapshot accurately represents the UI state being tested
4. **Verify test correctness** - Ensure the snapshot captures the intended behavior, UI elements, status messages, etc.
5. **Only then consider updating** - If the generated snapshot looks correct for the test scenario, then it may be appropriate to create the golden snapshot

**Example Workflow:**
1. Add new test to `tests/svg_snapshots.rs`
2. Run the test - it will fail (this is expected)
3. Examine the debug SVG file to see the actual rendered output
4. Verify the output matches what the test scenario should produce
5. If correct, the golden snapshot can be created; if incorrect, fix the test logic first

This approach ensures that snapshot tests accurately capture the intended UI behavior rather than just making tests pass.

### Environment Variables

- `OPEN_REPORT=1` - Automatically opens the HTML report in your default browser
- `SNAPSHOTS=overwrite` - Updates snapshot files with current test output

### Workflow

1. Make changes to the TUI code
2. Run `cargo test --test svg_snapshots`
3. If tests fail, review the HTML report (saved to `target/test-reports/`)
4. Click to copy the update command for accepted changes
5. Paste and run the command to update snapshots
6. Commit the updated snapshot files

### Tips

- Always review visual changes before updating snapshots
- The report uses synchronized scrolling for easy comparison
- Each test can be updated individually or all at once
- Snapshot files are stored in `tests/snapshots/`

## VHS Terminal Screenshot Testing (PDF Rendering)

**WARNING: This is a heavyweight testing approach.** It launches actual terminal emulators, runs the application, and captures real screenshots. Use this **primarily for PDF rendering validation** where the Kitty graphics protocol and image rendering cannot be tested with SVG snapshots.

**IMPORTANT FOR AI ASSISTANTS:** Do NOT run VHS tests unless explicitly requested by the user. These tests are slow, require a display, and should only be used when specifically testing PDF rendering changes.

**CRITICAL: NEVER update VHS golden snapshots (`--update` flag).** Golden snapshots are the source of truth for visual regression testing. Only a human can decide when to update them. If VHS tests fail:
1. Read the generated HTML report to understand the differences
2. Analyze whether the differences are actual bugs or minor rendering variations
3. Report findings to the user - describe what changed and whether it appears to be a real issue
4. Let the user decide whether to update the golden snapshots
5. NEVER run `./vhs_tests/run.sh --update` - this decision belongs to the user

For most UI testing, use the SVG-based snapshot tests described above.

### When to Use VHS Tests

- **PDF rendering validation** - Testing that PDF pages render correctly via Kitty graphics protocol
- **Terminal-specific rendering** - Verifying rendering differences between terminals (Kitty, Ghostty)
- **Full integration testing** - End-to-end tests requiring actual terminal graphics

### When NOT to Use VHS Tests

- Text-based UI components (use SVG snapshots instead)
- EPUB rendering (use SVG snapshots instead)
- Unit tests or component tests
- Any test that doesn't require actual terminal graphics

### Running VHS Tests

```bash
# Run ALL tapes (full test suite)
./vhs_tests/run.sh --terminal kitty

# Run specific tape only
./vhs_tests/run.sh --terminal kitty --tape pdf_smoke

# Run with verbose output (shows all commands being executed)
./vhs_tests/run.sh --terminal kitty --verbose

# Update golden snapshots (HUMANS ONLY - AI must never run this)
./vhs_tests/run.sh --terminal kitty --update
```

**Running the full suite** executes all `.tape` files in `vhs_tests/tapes/` sequentially. Each tape runs in its own Kitty window, and the harness automatically manages window creation/cleanup between tapes. The test harness launches a self-managed Kitty instance with remote control enabled, so no manual terminal setup is required.

### Directory Structure

```
vhs_tests/
├── tapes/                    # Test tape files (.tape)
├── golden/                   # Golden screenshots (by terminal)
│   └── kitty/

    ├── tape_runner.sh        # Tape parser and executor
    └── kitty_manager.sh      # Kitty terminal management
```

### Tape File Format

Tape files (`.tape`) define test sequences with simple commands:

```tape
# pdf_smoke.tape - Example tape file

# Specify PDF to test (relative to project root)
pdf tests/testdata/vhs_test.pdf

# Wait for app to load
wait 500

# Capture screenshot
screenshot initial

# Navigate (l = next page, h = previous)
key l
wait 300
screenshot page_2

# Zen mode toggle
ctrl z
wait 300
screenshot zen_mode

# Help popup
key ?
wait 500
screenshot help_popup

# Close popup
escape

# Quit
key q
```

### Tape Commands

| Command | Arguments | Description |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| `pdf` | `<path>` | PDF file to test (relative to project root) |
| `screenshot` | `<name>` | Capture screenshot with given name |
| `key` | `<char>` | Send single key press |
| `ctrl` | `<char>` | Send Ctrl+key combination |
| `escape` | - | Send Escape key |
| `return` | - | Send Return/Enter key |
| `wait` | `<ms>` | Wait specified milliseconds (default: 500) |

**IMPORTANT: Wait Times** - Kitty terminal is very fast. Never use wait times longer than 500ms in tape files. Most operations complete in 200-300ms. Only use 500ms for initial app load or page navigation that requires rendering.

### PDF Navigation Keys

For PDF documents:
- `l` / `h` - Next/previous page
- `j` / `k` - Scroll within page
- `Ctrl+z` - Toggle zen mode (hide sidebar)
- `?` - Help popup
- `q` - Quit

### Test Reports

When tests fail, an HTML report is generated showing:
- Side-by-side comparison of expected vs actual screenshots
- Pass/fail status for each screenshot
- Missing golden snapshots

Reports are saved to: `vhs_tests/output/reports/<terminal>_<tape>_report.html`

### Adding New VHS Tests

1. Create a new tape file in `vhs_tests/tapes/`:
   ```bash
   # vhs_tests/tapes/my_test.tape
   pdf tests/testdata/my_test.pdf
   wait 500
   screenshot initial
   # ... add test steps
   key q
   ```

2. Run the test (will fail initially - no golden snapshots):
   ```bash
   ./vhs_tests/run.sh --terminal kitty --tape my_test --verbose
   ```

3. Review generated screenshots in `vhs_tests/output/screenshots/kitty/my_test/`

4. If screenshots look correct, create golden snapshots:
   ```bash
   ./vhs_tests/run.sh --terminal kitty --tape my_test --update
   ```

### Terminal Support

Currently supported:
- **Kitty** - Self-managed instance with remote control (recommended for CI)

The test harness automatically launches and manages its own Kitty instance with the required settings (`allow_remote_control`, `listen_on`). No manual terminal configuration is needed.

## Architecture Patterns

### Design Principles
- **Trait-based abstraction**: Key external dependencies (`EventSource`, `SystemCommandExecutor`) are abstracted behind traits for testability
- **Component delegation**: The `NavigationPanel` manages mode switching and delegates rendering to appropriate sub-components
- **ADT modeling**: The `TocItem` enum uses algebraic data types for type-safe hierarchical structures
- **Consistent navigation**: The `VimNavMotions` trait provides uniform vim-style navigation across all components
- **Mock-friendly design**: All external interactions are abstracted to enable comprehensive testing

### Component Communication
1. **Main App Orchestration**: `main_app.rs` coordinates all components and handles high-level application logic
2. **Event Flow**: Events flow from `event_source.rs` → `main_app.rs` → relevant components
3. **Panel Focus**: The `FocusedPanel` enum determines which component receives keyboard events
4. **Action Propagation**: Components return actions (e.g., `SelectedActionOwned`) that the main app processes
5. **State Updates**: State changes trigger re-renders through the main render loop

## Important Notes

**File Management & Persistence:**
- The application scans the current directory for EPUB and PDF files on startup
- Bookmarks are automatically saved to `bookmarks.json` when navigating between chapters/pages or files
- **Comments are persisted to `.bookokrat_comments/book_<md5hash>.yaml` per book** (supports both EPUB and PDF)
- **Settings are persisted to config directory** via `settings.rs` (themes, margins, etc.)
- Images are extracted to `.bookokrat_temp_images/` or `temp_images/` and cached for performance
- The most recently read book is auto-loaded on startup
- Logging is written to `bookokrat.log` for debugging

**UI & Navigation:**
- The TUI uses vim-like keybindings throughout all components with Space-prefixed modal commands
- Multi-key sequences (like "gg") have a 1-second timeout
- **Help popup (`?` key) displays ANSI art with CP437 encoding and full keyboard reference**
- Mouse events are batched to prevent flooding and ensure smooth scrolling
- **Mouse tracker detects double/triple-clicks with 3-cell distance threshold**
- Text selection automatically scrolls the view when dragging near edges
- **Notification system shows toast messages for 5 seconds in bottom-right corner**
- **Theme selector** allows switching between Base16 color themes

**Reading Features:**
- Reading speed is set to 250 words per minute for time calculations (EPUB)
- Scroll acceleration increases speed when holding down scroll keys
- **Inline comments/annotations can be added, edited, and deleted on selected text** (EPUB and PDF)
- Jump list maintains a navigation history for easy backward/forward navigation (Ctrl+o/Ctrl+i)
- Book statistics provide a quick overview of book structure and size
- **Comments viewer** allows browsing all comments across the document

**EPUB Content Processing:**
- The application supports both EPUB2 (NCX) and EPUB3 (Nav) table of contents formats
- The text processing pipeline uses a Markdown AST-based approach with html5ever parser
- The main text reader is MarkdownTextReader, which uses the Markdown AST pipeline
- MathML expressions are converted to ASCII art with Unicode subscripts/superscripts when possible
- Mathematical expressions support advanced layouts including fractions, square roots, and summations
- Code blocks support syntax highlighting integrated into the rendering pipeline
- Tables are parsed and formatted for terminal display

**PDF Rendering** (PDF feature):
- **High-performance rendering** using MuPDF library with background worker pool
- **Page caching** with LRU eviction (5-15MB per page, configurable cache size)
- **Prefetching** of adjacent pages for smooth navigation
- **Kitty graphics protocol** with SHM-based image transfer (critical for 60fps)
- **Text extraction** for selection and search
- **PDF table of contents** parsing from document outline
- **Zoom levels** with smooth viewport updates
- **Terminal capability gates** are centralized in `src/terminal.rs` (protocol selection, comments/scroll/normal mode, iTerm version checks)

**Images & Media:**
- Image loading happens asynchronously to prevent UI blocking
- **Color mode detection adapts between true color (24-bit) and 256-color palettes**
- **The application VENDORS ratatui-image in `src/vendored/` - it's not a crates.io dependency**
- Image protocols (Kitty/Sixel/iTerm2/Halfblocks) are selected based on terminal capabilities
- **PDF uses Kitty SHM for optimal performance** - never use base64 for PDF images

**Performance & Integration:**
- Performance profiling can be enabled with pprof integration (`p` key)
- FPS monitoring helps track UI performance in real-time
- External readers are detected based on the platform (macOS, Windows, Linux)
- **PDF rendering uses worker pool** with configurable worker count

**Search:**
- Search functionality supports case-insensitive matching
- Note: fuzzy-matcher dependency is currently commented out

**Code Organization:**
- **MarkdownTextReader is modularized across multiple files in `src/widget/text_reader/`**
- **PDF reader is modularized in `src/widget/pdf_reader/`** (PDF feature)
- **PDF infrastructure is in `src/pdf/`** with Kitty protocol in `src/pdf/kitty/` (PDF feature)
- **Input handling is organized in `src/inputs/` module**
- **UI components are in `src/components/` and `src/widget/`**
- **Parsing logic is in `src/parsing/`**
- **Image handling is in `src/images/`**
- **Rust edition 2024, version 1.86 is used**

## Performance Considerations
- **CRITICAL**: Performance is one of the most important aspects of this project
- Never make significant changes like switching libraries unless explicitly instructed
- Always consider performance implications of any changes
- Image loading is done asynchronously to maintain UI responsiveness
- Images are cached after extraction to avoid repeated disk I/O
- Text content is cached to avoid expensive re-parsing
- Mouse events are batched to prevent performance degradation
- **PDF pages are cached** with LRU eviction and prefetching
- **PDF rendering uses background workers** to avoid blocking the UI
- **Kitty SHM is required** for PDF images - never use base64 transmission

## Error Handling Guidelines
- When logging errors, the received error object should always be logged (when possible)
- Never log a guess of what might have happened - only actual errors
- Use proper error context with anyhow for better debugging
- Preserve error chains for proper error tracing
- When introducing new regexes they should always be cached to avoid recompilation cycles
- Rendering of items in markdown_text_reader.rs should always use Base16Palette and should avoid relying on default ratatui style

## User Feedback for Unavailable Features (PDF Reader)

When a user attempts to use a feature that is not available in their current context (e.g., terminal limitations, mode restrictions), use the **error HUD** pattern instead of toast notifications.

### Error HUD Pattern
Use `self.set_error_hud(message)` followed by `return Some(InputAction::Redraw)` to display inline error messages. This provides immediate, contextual feedback that appears in the PDF viewer area.

**When to use error HUD:**
- User tries to activate a feature that's not supported in their terminal (e.g., normal mode in iTerm)
- User tries to use a feature outside its required mode (e.g., comments outside zen mode)
- Any direct user interaction that cannot be fulfilled due to context restrictions

**Examples:**
```rust
// Comments only available in zen mode
if !self.comments_enabled {
    self.set_error_hud("Comments are only available in zen mode for PDFs".to_string());
    return Some(InputAction::Redraw);
}

// PDF normal mode not supported in iTerm
if self.is_iterm {
    self.set_error_hud("PDF normal mode is not supported in iTerm".to_string());
    return Some(InputAction::Redraw);
}
```

**When to use toast notifications instead:**
- Background operation results (e.g., "Saved comment", "Copied 123 chars")
- Non-blocking informational messages
- Success/failure of async operations

## Rich Text Rendering Architecture (MarkdownTextReader)

### Core Design Principle
All markdown elements (lists, quotes, definition lists, tables, etc.) must preserve rich text formatting (bold, italic, links, etc.) rather than converting to plain text. This ensures consistent formatting behavior across all content types.

### render_text_spans API
The central method for rendering rich text content is `render_text_spans()`:

```rust
fn render_text_spans(
    &mut self,
    spans: &[Span<'static>],          // Pre-styled spans with formatting
    prefix: Option<&str>,             // Optional prefix (bullets, "> ", etc.)
    node_ref: NodeReference,
    lines: &mut Vec<RenderedLine>,
    total_height: &mut usize,
    width: usize,
    indent: usize,                    // Proper indentation support
    add_empty_line_after: bool,
)
```

**Key Features:**
- **Prefix Support**: Automatically adds prefixes like "• ", "> ", or numbered bullets
- **Indentation**: Properly handles indentation levels (2 spaces per level)
- **Rich Text Preservation**: Maintains all styling from `render_text_or_inline()`
- **Text Wrapping**: Handles text wrapping while preserving formatting
- **Link Coordinates**: Automatically fixes link coordinates after wrapping

### Standard Rendering Pattern
For any markdown element containing text:

1. **Generate styled spans** using `render_text_or_inline()`
2. **Apply element-specific styling** (e.g., quote color, bold for definitions)
3. **Call render_text_spans** with appropriate prefix and indentation
4. **Update line types** if needed for specific elements

```rust
// Example: List item rendering
let mut content_spans = Vec::new();
for item in content.iter() {
    content_spans.extend(self.render_text_or_inline(item, palette, is_focused, *total_height));
}

self.render_text_spans(
    &content_spans,
    Some(&prefix),           // "• " or "1. "
    node_ref.clone(),
    lines,
    total_height,
    width,
    indent,                  // Proper indentation
    false,                   // Don't add empty line
);
```

### CRITICAL: Avoid text_to_string()
**NEVER** use `text_to_string()` for rendering content as it strips all formatting:
- ❌ `let text_str = self.text_to_string(content);` (loses bold, italic, links)
- ✅ `content_spans.extend(self.render_text_or_inline(item, ...)` (preserves formatting)

### Updated Elements
The following elements now properly support rich text:
- **Lists**: Bullets/numbers + rich text content with proper indentation
- **Quotes**: "> " prefix + italic styling + rich text content
- **Definition Lists**: Bold terms + indented definitions with rich text
- **Future elements**: Should follow the same pattern

This architecture ensures that bold text, italic text, links, and other formatting work consistently across all markdown elements without hardcoding support for each element type.

# important-instruction-reminders
- Don't use eprintln if you need logging. This is TUI application. eprintln breaks UI. Use log crate to do proper logging
- Always log actual error that happened when creating "failed" branch logging
- **Git Operations**: Be very careful when modifying git state. Any operation that mutates git history (commit, reset, rebase, amend, push, etc.) must be explicitly requested by the user. If not sure, ask for confirmation before executing.

- **UTF-8 Text Handling**: All document content (EPUB, HTML, PDF) is UTF-8 encoded and may contain multi-byte characters (e.g., `–`, `é`, `中`). NEVER use byte-based string operations (`.len()`, `[start..end]` on `&str`) for text manipulation. Always use character-based operations:
  - Use `.chars().count()` instead of `.len()` for character count
  - Use `.chars().collect::<Vec<char>>()` then slice the Vec for substring extraction
  - Use `.char_indices()` when you need both character and byte positions
  - This applies to: search highlighting, text selection, cursor positioning, text wrapping

Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.
ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.
- Do not put useless comments. Comments should be only for code that does something unusual or tricky
