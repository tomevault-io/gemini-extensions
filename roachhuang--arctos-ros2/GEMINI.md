## arctos-ros2

> - Prefer modern c++ or python features like class, oop.

# Project general coding guidelines

## Code Style
- Prefer modern c++ or python features like class, oop.
- Use consistent indentation (4 spaces)
- Limit line length to 120 characters
- Use spaces around operators and after commas
- Place opening braces on the same line as the control statement
- Use single quotes for strings in Python and double quotes in C++

## Project Structure
- follow ros2 package structure for robotics projects
- Organize files into logical directories (e.g., src/, include/, tests/, docs/)

## Error Handling
- Use exceptions for error handling in Python and C++
- Catch specific exceptions rather than using a generic catch-all

- Use rospy logging functions for debug and error messages
- Leverage rospy parameters for configurable settings
- Utilize rospy timers for periodic tasks
- Implement proper shutdown procedures for rospy nodes
- Handle rospy callbacks efficiently to avoid blocking the main thread

- Implement custom stages when necessary for specialized behavior
- Use MTC's error handling and recovery mechanisms
# AI Coding Assistant Notes — arctos (focused)

This file gives concise, actionable guidance for AI coding agents working in this repository. Keep answers specific, reference files, and prefer minimal, testable changes.

**Architecture Overview**
- **ROS2 multi-package workspace:** key packages include [arctos_bringup](arctos_bringup), [arctos_description](arctos_description), [arctos_hardware_interface](arctos_hardware_interface), [arctos_moveit_config](arctos_moveit_config), [arctos_interfaces](arctos_interfaces).
- **Hardware & controllers:** the bridge between robot and ROS is in [arctos_hardware_interface/src/arctos_hardware_interface.cpp](arctos_hardware_interface/src/arctos_hardware_interface.cpp) and controller YAMLs in [arctos_bringup/config/ros2_controllers.yaml](arctos_bringup/config/ros2_controllers.yaml) and [arctos_bringup/config/real_controllers.yaml](arctos_bringup/config/real_controllers.yaml).
- **Simulation integration:** Gazebo and MoveIt are wired via launch files in [arctos_bringup/launch](arctos_bringup/launch) and [arctos_description/launch](arctos_description/launch). Use these to reproduce runtime behaviors.

**How components communicate**
- Hardware interface exposes joints to ros2_control and is configured by YAMLs under arctos_bringup/config.
- Action and message types live in [arctos_interfaces](arctos_interfaces) and are consumed by other packages (search for msg/ and action/ folders).
- MoveIt / MTC examples are in mtc_tutorial and moveit launch wrappers in arctos_bringup.

**Developer workflows (commands & tips)**
- Build: `colcon build --packages-select <pkg>`; use `--symlink-install` during development.
- Source environment: `source install/setup.bash` (always after build).
- Launch the robot stack (sim): `ros2 launch arctos_bringup sim_robot.launch.py` or `ros2 launch arctos_bringup arctos.launch.py` for full bringup.
- Launch MoveIt: `ros2 launch arctos_bringup my_moveit.launch.py` (see variants in launch folder).
- Run a specific node: `ros2 run <package> <executable>` — for C++ nodes look in package CMakeLists.txt and src/ for executable names.

**Repository conventions & patterns**
- Use ROS2-style packages (CMake + package.xml); C++ code is in `src/` and headers in `include/` when present.
- Configuration Yaml files live under package `config/` directories; prefer editing those for runtime changes instead of code when possible.
- Launch files are Python-based and may import other launch files. Prefer launching the top-level bringup file to reproduce behavior.
- Tests are not centralized; when adding tests, follow ament_cmake patterns and place them in `test/` or `src/test` depending on package type.

**Places to read first (quick triage order)**
- [arctos_hardware_interface/src/arctos_hardware_interface.cpp](arctos_hardware_interface/src/arctos_hardware_interface.cpp) — hardware mapping and lifecycle behavior.
- [arctos_bringup/launch/ros2_control.launch.py](arctos_bringup/launch/ros2_control.launch.py) or similar — how controllers are loaded.
- [arctos_bringup/config/ros2_controllers.yaml](arctos_bringup/config/ros2_controllers.yaml) — controller configs.
- [arctos_moveit_config](arctos_moveit_config) — robot URDF and MoveIt SRDF.

**Editing guidance for AI agents**
- Make minimal, focused edits. Prefer updating YAML or launch wiring over large C++ refactors unless asked.
- If changing behavior, add/modify a small unit or integration test where practical and run `colcon build` to validate.
- Preserve ROS parameter keys and topics names; search the repo for exact strings before renaming.

**Examples of actionable tasks**
- Add a controller parameter: update [arctos_bringup/config/ros2_controllers.yaml](arctos_bringup/config/ros2_controllers.yaml) and the matching controller loader in the launch file.
- Fix hardware joint mapping: modify [arctos_hardware_interface/src/arctos_hardware_interface.cpp](arctos_hardware_interface/src/arctos_hardware_interface.cpp) and verify with a `ros2 launch` of the bringup stack.

**What not to do**
- Do not change workspace-level build logic (top-level CMakeLists) without explicit instruction.
- Avoid large API-breaking renames across packages; these require coordinated updates to launch files and YAMLs.

If any file references are unclear or you want me to run builds/tests, tell me which package or launch file to exercise and I will run the commands and report results.
## Environment Configuration

- Use environment variables for configuration settings

- Avoid hardcoding environment-specific settings in the codebase
