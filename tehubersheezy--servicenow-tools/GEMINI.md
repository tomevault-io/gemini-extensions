# ServiceNow Tools

A general-purpose workspace for ServiceNow development resources — API tooling, SDK guides, prompts, and reference material. Anything useful for ServiceNow work lives here.

## Layout

- **`docs/now-sdk/`** — Project guide and complete CLI reference for the `now-sdk` (Fluent) toolchain, including undocumented commands and hidden flags. Symlink or copy `docs/now-sdk/CLAUDE.md` into any `now-sdk` project as its `CLAUDE.md` to load it on every Claude session there. The reference is in `docs/now-sdk/reference.md`.
- **`docs/workflow-authoring.md`** — How to create/update Playbooks (PAD, via GraphQL `now { pad }`) and Flows (Flow Designer, via the undocumented `/api/now/processflow/*` REST API). Verified live; covers payload shapes, gotchas, and the raw `sys_pd_*` / `sys_hub_*` table fallbacks.
- **`openapi/`** — OpenAPI specs exported from the instance, used as reference material for hand-rolling Table API / scoped REST calls. Regenerate with `npm run scrape:openapi` (see below); `_summary.json` is the run report, not a spec.
- **`graphql/`** — The instance's GraphQL schema, exported per namespace as introspection JSON + SDL (`<ns>.json` / `<ns>.graphql`), plus `_gliderecord.json` (compact table→columns index of the auto-generated GlideRecord namespaces) and `_summary.json` (run report). Regenerate with `npm run scrape:graphql` (see below).
- **`sn-api-explorer.html`** — Self-contained HTML explorer for the scraped OpenAPI specs. A build artifact: never hand-edit; regenerate with `npm run build:explorer` (source: `src/build-explorer.js`) after any re-scrape.
- **`sn-graphql-explorer.html`** — Same treatment for the GraphQL corpus: searchable schemas + tables, generated sample queries and curl. Build artifact of `npm run build:graphql-explorer` (source: `src/build-graphql-explorer.js`). The two explorers cross-link via each builder's `--xlink` flag.
- **`src/`** — Node.js scripts for programmatic instance access (CommonJS, uses `@servicenow/sdk`).

## Environment

Configured via `.env` (gitignored):

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `SN_INSTANCE_URL` | Instance base URL. A bare name (`dev421992`) or host is normalized to `https://<name>.service-now.com` |
| `SN_USERNAME` | Admin username |
| `SN_PASSWORD` | Admin password |
| `PORT` | Server port (default 3000) |

Auth is basic with username/password; the SDK also supports OAuth.

## Common APIs (for the API toolkit)

- **Table API** (`/api/now/table/{tableName}`) — CRUD on any table.
- **Aggregate API** (`/api/now/stats/{tableName}`) — count, avg, min, max, sum, group_by.

### REST API Explorer doc endpoints (undocumented)

The REST API Explorer's own Angular client calls these, and they all accept basic auth — so
enumerating and exporting every API on an instance needs no browser. Source of truth:
`/scripts/restapi/lib/js_includes_explorer.jsx` on any instance (see `docService` and
`specExportService.getSpec`).

| Endpoint | Returns |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/now/doc` | Full catalogue: `namespace → api → versions → resources` |
| `GET /api/now/doc/namespaces` | Namespace list |
| `GET /api/now/doc/services?namespace=<ns>` | APIs in one namespace |
| `GET /api/now/doc/{httpMethod}/{route}` | Per-resource detail |
| `GET /api/now/doc/oas_3?namespace=&name=&version=&format=json\|yaml` | OpenAPI 3 spec for one API |

Gotchas, both learned the hard way:

- **`oas_3` returns 406 for `Accept: application/json`.** It serves `application/octet-stream`
  regardless of `?format=`, so send `Accept: */*`. `ServiceNowClient.request` defaults Accept to
  JSON, hence the per-request `headers` override in `src/scrape-openapi.js`.
- **The Explorer's "Export OpenAPI Specification" link is not an href.** It XHRs the endpoint, then
  builds a `Blob` and clicks a synthesized object URL. There is no URL to scrape off the page and
  no server-side download route — which is why this looks like it requires browser automation when
  it doesn't. The client's only transform is `JSON.stringify(spec, null, 2)`; reproducing that
  (2-space indent, no trailing newline) makes script output byte-identical to a UI download.

## Regenerating the OpenAPI corpus

```bash
npm run scrape:openapi                              # all namespaces -> openapi/
npm run scrape:openapi -- --dry-run                 # list what would be written
npm run scrape:openapi -- --namespace now           # one namespace
npm run scrape:openapi -- --versions all            # every version, not just latest
npm run scrape:openapi -- --only-missing            # resume / retry just the failures
npm run scrape:openapi -- --format yaml --out spec-yaml
```

Roughly 30s for ~340 specs at the default concurrency of 8. Transient failures (429/5xx/network)
are retried 3× with linear backoff; anything still failing is listed in `_summary.json` and the
process exits 1, so `--only-missing` is the natural follow-up.

Note that spec richness varies by release — an Australia instance returns `"responses": {}` for
every operation, where older families populated response schemas. That's the platform's generator,
not the scraper; a UI export from the same instance is byte-identical.

## GraphQL endpoint

One merged schema at `POST /api/now/graphql` (basic auth works; the platform's GraphQL API
Explorer is just a GraphiQL client for it). Top-level fields partition it:

- **Scripted namespaces** (`now`, `global`, `snDecisionTable`, …) — one per scope with
  `sys_graphql_schema` records; each root field is one scripted schema.
- **Generated namespaces** — `GlideRecord_Query` / `GlideRecord_Mutation` /
  `GlideAggregateRecord_Query`: a query field per table
  (`<table>(sys_id, queryConditions, omitCount, pagination)`), CRUD mutations
  (`insert_/update_/delete_<table>`, one String arg per column), and aggregates
  (`GlideAggregateRecord_Query(tableName, groupBy, having, …)` →
  `aggregates { groupBy { field value displayValue } count avg min max sum countDistinct }`).
  Columns are *typed* wrapper objects (string/choice/journal/reference/… — see `columnEncoding`
  in `graphql/_gliderecord.json`) carrying the value plus dictionary metadata: select
  `{ value displayValue label internalType isMandatory canRead canWrite }`. Choice columns add
  `_choices { value displayValue }` (live, record-context choice list); reference columns add
  `_reference` to dot-walk; each table query also has
  `_table_metadata { label plural canRead canWrite canCreate canDelete auditWanted }` with ACLs
  evaluated for the calling user — schema discovery without touching `sys_dictionary`.

Gotchas, learned the hard way:

- **graphql-java's "good faith introspection" guard** rejects any query where an introspection
  meta-field like `__Type.fields` appears more than once (error `BadFaithIntrospection`) — e.g.
  asking for `queryType { fields }` and `mutationType { fields }` side by side fails. The standard
  single-fragment introspection query passes.
- **Full introspection is ~94 MB / ~2 minutes** on a PDI, because the generated namespaces
  materialize a type per table (~14,500 types). That's why `scrape-graphql` collapses them into
  `_gliderecord.json` (table → column names + the shared framework types) instead of storing them
  verbatim, and why the scripted namespaces (~1.5 MB total) are the only part kept in full.
- A handful of scripted schemas introspect as **empty object types** (fields hidden by scope
  protection). That's the platform, not the scraper.
- **Field metadata and `_choices` hang off `_results` rows** — they're read from a record
  instance, so an empty (or fully ACL-filtered) result set yields no field-level metadata.
  Zero-row schema discovery still needs `sys_dictionary` / `sys_choice`.
- **`insert_`/`update_` mutations can return `null` `_rowCount`/`_results` even on success.**
  Re-query to confirm a write landed.
- **Journal fields (comments/work notes):** `sys_journal_field` is row-ACL'd for non-admins
  (`_rowCount` leaks the count but `_results` comes back empty — the classic ACL signature), and
  aggregates on it are denied outright. Non-admin (e.g. itil) access is via the *parent record's*
  `comments` / `work_notes` / `comments_and_work_notes` columns, whose `displayValue` renders the
  full entry stream (`YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS - Author (Type)\n<text>\n\n`, timestamps in the calling
  user's timezone).

## Regenerating the GraphQL corpus

```bash
npm run scrape:graphql                              # one introspection -> graphql/
npm run scrape:graphql -- --dry-run                 # list what would be written
npm run scrape:graphql -- --namespace now           # one scripted namespace (skips _gliderecord)
npm run build:graphql-explorer                      # rebuild sn-graphql-explorer.html
```

## Conventions

- `.env`, `.DS_Store`, `node_modules/`, `.playwright-cli/` are gitignored.
- The `openapi/` and `graphql/` corpora are reference-only (scraped from the instance, not authored here).
- Documents under `docs/<topic>/CLAUDE.md` are designed to be loaded as project-level `CLAUDE.md` files in *other* projects (via symlink or copy), not just consumed in-tree.
