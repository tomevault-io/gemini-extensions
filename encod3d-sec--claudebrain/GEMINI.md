# Pentesting & Bug Bounty Wiki: Schema

---

## Quick reference

| Operation | Action |
|---|---|
| Query | `qmd_query "..."` via `wiki-search` MCP -> read results -> synthesise |
| Ingest skip check | Read frontmatter only; skip page if ingest slug already in `sources:` |
| Re-index / wiki status | `wiki` skill |
| Git clone | Always WSL: `wsl -d kali-linux -u kali -- git clone <url> /home/kali/<name>` |
| Run tooling against a target | Kali VM over SSH: `bash /root/vm.sh '<cmd>'` (VPN route + tools + chromium live there) -> `docs/virtual-machine.md` |

| Vuln/CVE research on a target (binary/repo/app/firmware) | `research` skill (scaffolds `raw/research/<project>/`)                       |

Vault-local skills (read file directly from `skills/`): `code-review/`, `obsidian/`, `wiki/`, `research/` (CVE-discovery loop), `disclosure/` (finding -> CVE). Workflow + hunt skills live under `skills/hunt/`: all `hunt-*` plus `wiki-arsenal` (fast PARALLEL wiki lookup engine over techniques/payloads/tools/cheatsheets; `arsenal` delegates to it), `triage`, `evidence`, `coverage`, `ingest`, `next-move`, `wiki-recon`, `nday`, `research-ingest`, `ctf-box`, `ctf-category`, `screenshot` (visual PoC capture via `scripts/shot.py`/`pocshot.sh`, chromium on Kali -> `targets/<eng>/poc/`), `screenshot-burp` (Burp Repeater request/response PoC via `scripts/burpshot.sh`), and `learn` (post-engagement knowledge harvest: diff a completed engagement against the wiki, promote the delta via the leak-gated stage->promote pipeline). The `claude-md-improver/` local copy is an offline fallback (auto-invocation disabled); prefer the `claude-md-management:claude-md-improver` plugin. For MCP setup, hooks, and plugin troubleshooting: read `skills/skills-setup.md`.

Search rule: never read `wiki/index.md` to find pages - always search first. MCP tool names: `mcp__wiki-search__qmd_query` (semantic), `mcp__wiki-search__qmd_search` (keyword).

`session/memory.md` holds long-term editorial patterns. Load it when making editorial or tagging decisions.

## Hunt Skill Auto-Triggers

Vuln-type triggers are fired deterministically by the `hunt-trigger.py` UserPromptSubmit hook, which matches the prompt against `skills/hunt/triggers.json` (single source of truth) in two tiers: `triggers` (explicit vuln-type terms -> a **MANDATORY** `Skill(<hunt>)` load-first directive) and `surface_triggers` (natural attack-surface terms like "login form"/"upload field"/"api endpoint" -> a softer "consider `Skill(...)`" line). When a hard trigger fires, treat the directive as a real instruction: load the named hunt skill before responding, unless it is genuinely irrelevant (then say why in one line). Edit `triggers.json` to change mappings, not this table. Every prompt (fire or miss) is logged leak-safe to `.trigger-fire.jsonl` (no prompt text); run `python3 scripts/trigger-stats.py` to see match rate and tune the surface tier. The table below is the human reference plus the non-keyword rows (triage/evidence) that stay model-judged.

Vuln-type rows (SSRF/XSS/SQLi/IDOR/RCE/auth/federation/injection/m365/vpn -> matching hunt skill) live in `triggers.json`, fired by the hook. Only the model-judged rows remain here:

| Condition | Skill |
|-----------|-------|
| Starting recon on target (subdomains, endpoints, surface) | wiki-recon |
| "Is this valid?", "should I report?", finding needs confirmation | triage |
| Moving finding Research -> Completed | triage then evidence |

---

## Engagement discipline (state-first, anti-loop)

**Execution loop (per offensive step, ALWAYS).** The hooks below are advisory and can misfire or go
silent (e.g. when the `wiki-search` MCP drops); THIS loop is the real enforcement because it is always
in context. On every engagement, run each step in order, do not skip under momentum:
1. **Wiki-first.** Before exploiting a fingerprinted service/class, consult the wiki for it -
   fastest path is `Skill(wiki-arsenal)` (parallel lookup across techniques/payloads/tools/cheatsheets;
   say "deep" for the 4-agent synthesized card), or directly `qmd_query`/`qmd_search` via the
   `wiki-search` OR `caveman-shrink` MCP (same index), the `qmd` CLI, or `Read` the `wiki/` page.
   MCP-independent: if one path is down, use another; never skip it.
2. **Tools, not hand-rolls.** Reach for the installed tool (nmap/ffuf/nuclei/httpx/nxc/sqlmap/borg/...),
   never a hand-rolled `curl`/`/dev/tcp` loop; if none fits, say why in one line. Enumerate NON-STANDARD
   installed tools (borg/borgmatic/restic/duplicity, backup + secret managers) as a loot/privesc lead -
   a leaked backup passphrase + a reused key beats grinding a hardened-container escape.
3. **Capture the request AND each landing, live.** `reqshot` the real request+response for every
   exploit/lead request (the thm_tricipher standard; an exploit POST auto-cards now, but reqshot the
   deliberate one), and screenshot each success to `poc/` the moment it lands (`evshot`/`pocshot`/
   `shot.py`), never at the end. NEVER hand-write / fabricate an evidence card.
4. **Persist immediately.** A host/cred/path/flag lands -> write `state.md`/`loot.md`/`paths.md` before
   the next move; a dead-end -> one `Deadends.md` line.
5. **Close out.** Both flags captured -> set `## STATUS: SOLVED` in state.md AT ONCE, then run
   `Skill(walkthrough)`, then `Skill(learn)` (harvest this box's generic lessons into `wiki/`). The
   Stop-gates fire these ONLY once SOLVED is set, so set it promptly.

Token control and real findings come from the same rule: do not repeat work.

- **Scope-first.** Read `targets/<eng>/scope.md` before acting. Never touch an out-of-scope target or use forbidden tooling (`no_bruteforce`/`no_dos`/`passive_only` flags). The `next-move` analyzer already filters out-of-scope hosts and suppresses spray/active probing per RoE; respect the same bounds in everything else.
- **State-first.** Before any recon, spray, or exploit attempt, read the active engagement `state.md`, `loot.md`, `paths.md`, and `Deadends.md`. Never re-run a documented dead-end or re-spray a known-failed cred without new input (new cred, new pivot, new payload class).
- **Stop condition.** A vector is exhausted after a bounded effort (e.g. OOB sink: ~30-40 payloads zero callbacks; spray: full user x pass matrix once). On exhaustion: append one line to `Deadends.md` + update `paths.md` status, then switch vector. Do not grind, do not re-loop.
- **Capture as you go.** After a recon/cred tool runs, extract results into `state.md`/`loot.md` immediately (the `recon-capture.py` hook nudges this). Prose in chat is lost; tables persist across sessions and devices.
- **Tooling-first.** Use the installed tool (nmap/ffuf/nuclei/nxc/linpeas), not a hand-rolled bash reimplementation - better output, fires the fingerprint router, and `recon-capture.py` snaps it to evidence. Hand-rolled bash only when no tool fits (say why). Enforced by the `ctf-box` + `hunt-*` skills, not a runtime hook.
- **OOB-gate blind bugs.** Blind SSRF/SSTI/SQLi claims need an out-of-band callback, never inference. Enforced per hunt skill.
- **Reuse loot.** Reuse captured creds across `state.md` hosts before researching new ones. Default/known creds first (look up vendor defaults via context7, see [[default-credentials]]); broad spraying of captured creds is a last resort, not an early or auto move.
- **Distill reusable knowledge.** When an engagement yields a default cred or a reusable API request pattern, add the **generic** form (product + cred / endpoint + impact, no client specifics) to `wiki/cheatsheets/default-credentials.md` or `api-request-findings.md`. Next engagement, check these first. Client specifics stay in `targets/<eng>/`. At close-out, `Skill(learn)` sweeps the whole completed engagement for any generic lesson still missing from `wiki/` and promotes the delta through the leak-gated stage (`wiki-stage.py`) -> promote (`wiki-promote.py`) pipeline; it auto-fires via the loop-driver once the engagement is `SOLVED` and its walkthrough is assembled.

## Behavior hooks

Caveman plugin installed. SessionStart hook activates full mode automatically - respond terse, drop articles/filler, fragments OK. If hooks fail, activate manually: `/caveman`.

SessionStart also auto-loads `session/hot.md`. No manual reads needed.

Engagement-state hooks (live via `~/.claude/vault-hooks` symlink -> `skills/hooks/`). All inject context (a suggestion/warning), never silently run tools; all fail open. Full mechanics in `docs/auto-triggers.md`; the behaviorally-relevant summary:

| Hook | Event | Effect |
|------|-------|--------|
| `engagement-init.py` | SessionStart | Self-heals the engagement file set; injects state summary + top next-moves + session cache + OOB HITs + drift/CVE warnings. |
| `hunt-trigger.py` | UserPromptSubmit | Routes to hunt skills from `triggers.json` (surfaces the relevant Skill; the skill carries the mandate); leak-safe telemetry to `.trigger-fire.jsonl`. Skips injected/non-prompt content. |
| `recon-capture.py` | PostToolUse/Bash | Routes detected tech -> the hunt Skill (`playbook.json`), auto-cards leads/pages, auto-correlates OOB callbacks, auto-routes SSRF sinks (RoE-gated). Capture + routing only. |
| `scope-guard.py` | PreToolUse/Bash | Warns on out-of-scope host/IP (CIDR-aware) or RoE-forbidden tooling. Advisory, never blocks. |
| `session-guard.py` | PreToolUse/Write | Warns when a write would put a client marker into a generic `session/*` file. Advisory, never blocks. |
| `loop-driver.py` | Stop | Render-only evidence drain: renders staged PoC cards (recon / leads / pages + tmux) at turn-end. Never blocks the turn or forces continuation. |

Register/repair the set per-device with `bash setup/install-hooks.sh`; `engagement-init` warns at SessionStart if a hook is unregistered (canonical set in `scripts/check-hooks.py`).

Active engagement set by `targets/active.md`. Create one with `bash setup/new-engagement.sh <name> <pentest|bugbounty|ctf>`. Per-type schema from `setup/templates/<type>/`; `engagement_type` in state.md frontmatter drives analyzer + self-heal. Files: `targets/<eng>/{state,loot,paths,log,scope,coverage,walkthrough,Vuln-index,Deadends,oob}.md` + `ingest/` + `recon/` (auto-captured scan-tool screenshot cards; deliberate exploit/PoC/flag shots go to `poc/`) (all self-healed by `engagement-init`). `walkthrough.md` = full copy-pasteable boot-to-root reproduction (distinct from the terse `log.md` audit); `log.md` doubles as the per-engagement continuity cache (its newest block is surfaced at SessionStart, so client narrative goes there, never in generic `session/hot.md`). Missing wiki pages surfaced by `scripts/wiki-gaps.py`.

Framework subsystems (each is a script + an on-demand skill; detail in `docs/auto-triggers.md`):

| Subsystem | Entry point | Key rule |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Ingest | `ingest` skill | Drop raw output in `targets/<eng>/ingest/`; the skill synthesizes -> state/loot/paths then archives. |
| Next-move | `scripts/next_move.py` / `next-move` | Ranks moves (type + scope aware). Update tables after acting so the next run re-ranks. |
| Fingerprint testing | `scripts/playbook.json` | Maps tech -> targeted tests + hunt skill + the `wiki/payloads/` arsenal. Extend both as you learn new tech. |
| Coverage | `scripts/coverage.py` / `coverage` | Per-asset untested classes. Record a tested class in `targets/<eng>/coverage.md` or the gap recurs. |
| Finding quality | `scripts/find-lint.py` | Findings scaffold from `setup/templates/_find.md`; run find-lint before /evidence and before a report. |

**Client-data boundary (hard rule):** all client/engagement specifics (hosts, IPs, creds, domains, findings, narrative) live ONLY under `targets/<eng>/` (git-ignored). Never write them into `session/*`, `wiki/`, tracked `docs/`, scripts, or commit messages; per-engagement narrative goes to `targets/<eng>/log.md` (audit + continuity cache). `session-guard.py` advises on violations; run `bash scripts/check-leaks.sh` before sharing. Full detail: `docs/sharing.md`.

## Machine-specific vault access

Per-machine hostnames and vault paths live in the git-ignored `CLAUDE.local.md`
(copy `CLAUDE.local.example.md` to create it), kept out of the published repo.
The path resolvers (`setup/vault-path.sh`) and hooks self-locate or read
`OBSIDIAN_VAULT` / `QMD_VAULT`, so a single-machine setup needs no local file.

@CLAUDE.local.md

**Rules:**
- `raw/` is read-only. Exceptions: populate `raw/git/` via git clone (WSL only), and `raw/research/<project>/` research workspaces created by `setup/new-research.sh` (the `research` skill writes loop state there). Research on public targets is not client data; client/engagement work still lives only under `targets/`.
- `wiki/` and `targets/` are fully owned by Claude. Create, update, and cross-reference freely.
- `wiki/index.md` and `session/log.md` updated after every ingest, query-that-produces-a-page, and lint pass (framework work only; client/engagement narrative goes to `targets/<eng>/log.md`).
- Update `CLAUDE.md` when vault structure changes; `docs/setup.md` for machine/path changes; `docs/conventions.md` for editorial standards changes.

Read `targets/TARGETS.md` for the engagement playbook: FIND naming, severity definitions, directory structure, and the wiki integration rule.

**Session end:** Before closing any session, run pause-work (`gsd:pause-work` if the gsd plugin is installed on this machine, else do the steps manually). Generic/framework summary -> `session/hot.md`, `session/log.md`, `session/memory.md` (no client specifics). Client/engagement narrative -> `targets/<eng>/log.md` (audit + continuity cache) ONLY.

---

## Page types and frontmatter

Full schema in `docs/page-types.md`. **Skip rule:** during ingest, read only the frontmatter first. If the ingest slug is already in `sources:`, skip the page entirely. Only read full content when you will update it.

---

## Wiki Workflows

Read `docs/workflows.md` before performing any ingest, target session, lint, or query. When a technique appears in multiple sources, synthesise all into one technique page; do not create one page per source.

---

## Output rules

- Never use em-dashes (`--`). Use a comma, semicolon, or rewrite the sentence. (`--` is permitted inside code blocks as a CLI flag.)
- Never use emojis.

---

## Image handling

Never copy image embeds (`![[Pasted image *.png]]` or `![](url)`) into wiki pages. Reconstruct commands as code blocks from context. Wiki pages must be image-free.
