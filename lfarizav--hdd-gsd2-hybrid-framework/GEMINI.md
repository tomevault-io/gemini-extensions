# AGENTS.md

> **Research-backed design** (Gloaguen et al., 2026, arXiv:2602.11988): This file intentionally
> contains only **minimal, non-redundant requirements**. The peer-reviewed study
> "Evaluating AGENTS.md: Are Repository-Level Context Files Helpful for Coding Agents?"
> evaluated 4 coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, Qwen Code, OpenAI) across 438 real-world
> tasks and found:
>
> - **LLM-generated context files reduced task success by 3%** and **increased cost by 20%+**
> - **Developer-written context files only improved success by 4%** while **increasing cost by 19%**
> - **Codebase overviews had zero effect** on agent's ability to find relevant files
> - **Agents strictly follow listed instructions** (uv: 1.6× when mentioned, 0.01× when not)
> - **Conclusion: include only minimal requirements.** Unnecessary instructions make tasks harder
>   and inflate costs, contradicting current agent-developer recommendations.

## Testing

- **Framework:** `go test` (stdlib) + `testify` for assertions
- Unit tests live in `*_test.go` files alongside source; integration and e2e tests under `tests/integration/` and `tests/e2e/`
- All tests **must pass** before a PR is merged; CI enforces this.
- Add or update tests for every code change, even when not explicitly requested.
- Never remove a failing test; fix it or open a follow-up issue.
- Coverage threshold: **80 %** (statements). Run `go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./... && go tool cover -func=coverage.out`.

---

## Code style

- **Language:** Go 1.22+
- Tabs for indentation, enforced by `gofmt` / `goimports`
- Explicit error returns; no `panic` in library code
- Descriptive names over comments — `fetchUserByID` beats `getUser` + a comment

```go
// ✅ Good
func fetchUserByID(id string) (*User, error) {
	if id == "" {
		return nil, errors.New("user ID is required")
	}
	return db.FindUser(id)
}

// ❌ Bad — vague name, swallowed error, empty interface
func getUser(id interface{}) interface{} {
	u, _ := db.FindUser(fmt.Sprint(id))
	return u
}
```

## Git workflow

- Branch naming: `feat/<slug>`, `fix/<slug>`, `chore/<slug>`, `docs/<slug>`
- PR titles follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):
  `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `refactor:`
- Squash-merge into `main`; keep a clean linear history
- **Never force-push to `main`**

## Research findings: What to include (and exclude) in AGENTS.md

**Per the peer-reviewed study (Gloaguen et al., 2026):**

### ✅ Include (minimal, specific)

- **Tool requirements**: "Use `go` module commands (not dep or glide)" — agents follow these (1.6× usage when mentioned)
- **Build/test commands**: Exact commands agents should run, nothing more
- **Code style rules**: Specific conventions (e.g., "2-space indent", "single quotes, no semicolons")
- **Critical security**: Only OWASP Top 10 or project-specific security boundaries

### ❌ Exclude (these don't help and add cost)

- **Codebase overviews**: Study found zero effect on agent discovery speed
- **Directory listings**: Agents explore automatically; descriptions waste tokens
- **General architecture**: Already in README and docs/
- **Non-critical guidance**: Duplicate what `.md` files already explain

### Why this matters

- **Unnecessary instructions increase reasoning tokens by 14-22%** (harder tasks)
- **Each extra requirement costs more** without performance gain
- **Agents respect instructions** — so make them count

---

## Environment variables

All required env vars are documented in `.env.example`.
Copy it to `.env` (never commit `.env`) and populate real values locally.
Use a secrets manager (e.g. AWS Secrets Manager, Vault) in production.

---

## Security considerations

- No secrets in source code or commit messages (pre-commit hook enforces this)
- Validate and sanitise all external input at system boundaries
- Use parameterised queries — never interpolate user input into SQL
- OWASP Top 10 is the baseline; flag security concerns in PR descriptions
