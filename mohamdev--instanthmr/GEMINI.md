# CLAUDE.md

Behavioural guidelines plus what you need to know about this repo before touching it.

**Tradeoff:** these guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

---

## 0. Never commit

**The user commits. Always.** Never run `git commit`, `git push`, `git merge`, or
`git rebase`. When work is ready, print the commands and let the user run them.
Keep commit messages to one or two short sentences.

`git add` and read-only git (`status`, `diff`, `log`, `show`) are fine.

---

## 0.5 Write for a human, not a compiler

**The user is a person reading a terminal, not a log parser.** Answers that are
technically correct and unreadable are failures. This has come up more than
once — take it seriously.

- **Define every name before you use it.** `scale_lo`, `m_noflip`, `fk_scale`,
  `n_skip_run` mean nothing to someone who has not just read that function. If
  a variable, flag or file has to appear, say what it *is* in plain words
  first, once.
- **Give commands in the form the user actually runs them.** This repo launches
  through `datasets_pipeline/jeanzay/52_train_ddp.slurm` with `RUN_NAME=... MIX=...
  EXTRA_TRAIN_ARGS=... sbatch`. Read the launcher and match it. A bare `srun
  python ...` line the user has never typed is not an answer.
- **Say what to run, in what order, and what happens next.** If a command is
  optional, say so. If you offer a check, say what a good result looks like.
- **Lead with the answer.** The finding first, the evidence after. Do not make
  the user read a derivation to learn whether it worked.
- **Explain the mechanism, don't just name it.** "The bone scales enter the
  kinematics multiplicatively, so +10 makes a 336 m skeleton" teaches
  something; "unbounded scale parameters caused divergence" does not.
- **Cut the ceremony.** No restating the request, no listing what you are about
  to do, no summary of the summary.

If the user says they cannot follow an answer, that is a defect to fix in the
next answer, not a preference to note.

## 1. Think before coding

Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.

- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them — don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity first

Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: *"Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?"* If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical changes

Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.

- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it — don't delete it.
- Remove imports and variables that *your* changes orphaned; leave pre-existing
  dead code alone unless asked.

The test: every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-driven execution

Define success criteria. Loop until verified.

- "Add validation" → "write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Change a loss" → "show the new term is numerically what you claim, on real data"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan with a verification per step.

In this repo "verify" usually means **run it on real data and show numbers**, not
read the code and assert it looks right. `data/` holds a local corpus and
`checkpoints/mhr_model.pt` is the MHR rig, so most claims about geometry, losses
or augmentation can be measured in under a minute. Do that.

---

## What the training labels are

**This is not a distillation setup.** Training is supervised by the released
ground-truth annotations of `facebook/sam-3d-body-dataset` — the human MHR fits
Meta used to build SAM 3D Body. The whole cluster corpus (`sam3d_gt_sa1b` /
`_aic` / `_harmony4d` / `_coco` / `_mpii`) and every number in this repo's result
tables are of that kind.

Distilling from the `sam-3d-body-dinov3` model is an **option**:
`tools/annotate_dataset.py` runs it over your own images and is the only thing
that writes `data/sam3d_distill_mix/`. Use it for imagery the released dataset
does not cover, and remember it caps the student at the teacher's accuracy.

Two consequences for reading this file and the code:

- **`train_distill_*.py` and `data/sam3d_distill_mix/` are historical names.**
  They say nothing about which labels a run used.
- **Where the docs say "teacher" they almost always mean "the training
  target".** Parameter ranges, oracle ablations and
  `adapter_j14_h36m_teacher.npz` were all measured against the *dataset's*
  annotations, not against model inference.

## Where to read first

Docs are the source of truth; the code is bigger than any context window.

| order | file | for |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `instanthmr_distill_train/README.md` | which training script to run, what `--preset v2` and `--losses rebalanced` change, the pair-index cache |
| 2 | `datasets_pipeline/jeanzay/STATUS.md` | Jean Zay cluster + data state, what is built, job templates *(git-excluded, local only)* |
| 3 | `datasets_pipeline/JEAN_ZAY.md` | site runbook: env, quotas, proxy quirks *(git-excluded, local only)* |
| 4 | `benchmark/README.md` | how published numbers are produced; the 3DPW GT (SMPL forward + H36M regressor), the MHR->J14 adapter, and why **J14+adapter** is the row to quote |
| 5 | `datasets_pipeline/README.md` | how the corpus is built, including the SA-1B visibility mask |
| 6 | `docs/architecture.md` | the student model |
| 7 | `docs/todo.md` | open work: reproducing the teacher's regression pathway, the crop-resolution rebuild, model selection. Cleared and rewritten 2026-09-12 |

`datasets_pipeline/jeanzay/` and `JEAN_ZAY.md` are in `.git/info/exclude` on
purpose — they carry the login name, jump host and project code. Keep
site-specific material there and portable material in the repo docs.

## Repo-specific traps

**One trainer, two layers.** `train_distill_mhr_only.py` holds the dataset,
augmentation, model and losses. `train_distill_jz.py` imports it and adds DDP,
mixture sampling, resume and 3DPW validation. Substance changes go in the base
file so both entry points get them. **Never fork the base file** — that is how
`train_distill.py` drifted until its ONNX export silently zeroed the SimCC 2D
head, with keypoints collapsing to the bbox centre and no error raised.

**`--preset baseline` and `--losses legacy` must stay bit-identical.** Runs in
flight use them as controls. The two flags are orthogonal axes — `--preset` is
the input pipeline and the absolute-pose terms, `--losses` is the loss budget —
and both default to the old behaviour. If you change the dataset or a loss, gate
it behind a config flag whose default reproduces the old behaviour, and prove it
— diff a few dozen augmented samples against `git show HEAD:<file>`. When you
do, compare **alternating** calls: the TorchScript MHR forward differs by ~5e-10
on its first invocation in a process (cold-kernel autotuning), which reads as a
regression if you only compare once.

**Know the MHR parameter layout before touching a pose loss.** From
`character_torch.parameter_transform.parameter_names`: `0:3` root translation
(always 0 in the corpus, 1 unit = 10 cm), `3:6` root rotation (extrinsic-XYZ
Euler, driving joint-parameter slots 10/11/12 *and nothing else*), `6:136` the
130 local joint angles, `136:204` 68 bone scales. Consequences that cost a
session to re-derive: `6:136` is exactly invariant to the in-plane rotation
augmentation, so it never needed the `m_ident` mask; and the 45 `shape_params`
move the 127-joint skeleton by `0.00e+00 cm`, so they are mesh-only and every
loss and metric in the trainer is blind to them.

**The teacher's root Euler triple is REVERSED relative to the rig, and its own
source hides it.** `sam_3d_body/models/heads/mhr_head.py` decodes the global
rotation with `roma.rotmat_to_euler("ZYX", R)`. roma's *uppercase* letters mean
extrinsic and it returns the triple in the order of the string, so `"ZYX"` hands
back `(theta_z, theta_y, theta_x)` -- the reverse of the rig's extrinsic-XYZ
`model_params[3:6]`. Feeding `(0.3, 0.5, 0.7)` through the teacher's own forward
returns `(0.7, 0.5, 0.3)`. Measured against `checkpoints/mhr_model.pt` (md5
8f21d804..., byte-identical to the teacher's `assets/mhr_model.pt`): drive
`3:6`, rigid-fit the 125 joints it moves, and the recovered rotation matches
`batch6DFromXYZ` to **0.00000-0.014 deg** while roma's `"ZYX"` of the same
triple is **36-92 deg away**. Do the fit about the moving sub-skeleton, not the
centroid and not joint 0 -- the root drives joint-parameter slots 10/11/12, so
joints 0 and 1 do not move and a centroid Procrustes leaves an 11 mm residual
that reads as a convention mismatch. Either convention round-trips if encode and
decode agree, so a wrong choice trains fine and only shows up as a rotation loss
measuring distance in a permuted space. `instanthmr_distill_train/mhr_cont.py`
uses the rig's and says so; do not "fix" it to match the teacher's line.

**The vertex subset now has two independent consumers, and mixing them breaks
a loss silently.** `--w-verts` skins 595 farthest-point samples; the teacher's
exact 70-landmark mapping (`--exact-landmarks`) needs the 468 vertices its first
70 rows reference. **Those two sets overlap in exactly 10 vertices** -- the 468
are not a subset of the 595, and raising `n_verts` does not reach them, because
farthest-point sampling optimises coverage, not landmark support. So
`_build_vertex_subset` skins their UNION (1053) and keeps `verts_loss_pos` /
`lm_vert_pos` to index the two consumers separately. If `loss_verts` ever
averages over the union instead of `verts_loss_pos`, it silently changes value
and stops being comparable with generations 6-8 -- no error, just a different
number. The union is free (181.2 ms for 595 alone vs 180.9 ms for 1053 at batch
64), because the cost is the forward-kinematics pass, not the vertex count.
`instanthmr_distill_train/assets/mhr_landmarks70.npz` is a new file and must be
rsynced. Scoring stays on the fitted readout by default and is now a switch
(`--landmarks exact` on `eval_3dpw_ckpt.py` / `eval_emdb_ckpt.py`,
`--val-landmarks exact` on the trainer). Measured 2026-09-22 it is worth
**0.13 mm** of 3DPW-test J14+adapter PA-MPJPE and 0.1 mm of EMDB-1 — and the
same 0.13 mm on `g7h_s0`, which trained WITHOUT `--exact-landmarks`, so it is a
property of the operator, not of the training flag. The mismatch it removes is
real (both adapters are fitted from the annotation `joints_3d`, i.e. the exact
readout), but it is an offset, not a re-ranking. `fitted` stays default so the
metric keeps measuring the deployed path and every recorded row stays
comparable; **never put fitted-scored and exact-scored rows in one table.**

**`--cont-head` adds two files that must be rsynced.**
`instanthmr_distill_train/mhr_cont.py` and
`instanthmr_distill_train/assets/mhr_cont_head.npz` (30 KB, built by
`tools/build_cont_head_assets.py` from the teacher checkpoint plus the corpus).
Neither existed before 2026-09-12 and the job dies at startup without them.
Gate any change to that head with `tools/verify_cont_head.py` (24 checks,
including GT reachability to 0.0003 mm of forward kinematics) *and*
`tools/ddp_smoke.py --cont-head`.

**The student's MHR outputs are unbounded and 77 of them are body SIZE.** The
head is a plain `nn.Linear`. `0:3` root translation (exactly `0.000e+00` in all
24,000 sampled annotations — the person is placed by `cam_trans`), `130:136`
the `*_length/_width_flexible` parameters, and `136:204` the 68 bone scales all
scale the skeleton, the last **multiplicatively along the kinematic chain**:
uniform +10 gives a 336 m skeleton, +25 gives 28,300 km. That, not the learning
rate, killed four 300-epoch runs at epochs 24-32 on 2026-09-06. Watch for the
two traps: `130:136` *look* like pose parameters (they sit inside `6:136`) but
drive joint **translation** channels, so bounding only `136:204` still reaches
375 m; and `6:130` are genuine rotations that stay at ~1.5 m at any magnitude,
so leave them alone. `--bound-scales` fixes it from
`assets/mhr_size_bounds.npz`; that file is **new and must be rsynced** or the
job dies at startup.

**The anomaly guard deletes the gradient that would fix the anomaly.** A batch
over `anomaly_loss_threshold` was skipped whole — but `loss_scale`/`loss_pose`
in that same batch are the only force pulling the sizes back, so the sample was
quarantined for good. Worse, `bad` is all-reduced with `MAX`: one bad sample in
4x64 = 256 vetoes the step for every rank, so 2% runaway samples stop 99.4% of
steps. Use `--anomaly-safe-fallback`, which steps on the non-FK terms instead
(`safe_loss_subset`, cosine +1.0000 with `teacher - prediction`). Never "fix" a
divergence here by lowering the LR alone: `OneCycleLR(pct_start=0.1)` peaks at
10% of the run, so a lower peak only moves *when* it dies.

**A single-process smoke test cannot clear a training change for the cluster.**
`52_train_ddp.slurm` wraps the student in `DistributedDataParallel` with the
default `find_unused_parameters=False`, and that Reducer exists **nowhere** in a
laptop run -- not in `train_distill_jz.py` on one GPU, not in `--self-test`, not
in `--overfit-test`. A parameter that receives no gradient therefore passes
every local check and then aborts the job on the SECOND optimiser step with
`Expected to have finished reduction in the prior iteration ... Parameter
indices which did not receive grad for rank N: <i>`, where `<i>` indexes
`list(model.parameters())`. On 2026-09-11 that burned all eight queued
generation-7 `hgnetv2_b4` links while the `repvit_m2_3` arms ran nine hours
beside them: `forward_features()` stops before the timm classifier head, and
`num_classes=0` empties that head for repvit but leaves hgnetv2_b4 a 2048x2048
`last_conv` -- 4,194,304 orphaned parameters, index 241. `InstantHMRStudent`
now replaces any head that still has parameters with `nn.Identity()` (a no-op
for a parameterless one, so every existing state_dict is byte-identical --
verified, 1542 keys, same sha256). **Run `python tools/ddp_smoke.py --backbone
<name> --w-verts <w>` before submitting any architecture change.** It builds a
real Reducer at world size 1 and takes under a minute; world 1 is enough,
because the unused-parameter check is world-size independent.

**The pair index is a host-RAM bomb, and it kills jobs with no traceback.**
Four generation-6 jobs were OOM-killed at 74-76 GiB per node between epochs 14
and 33 on 2026-09-08. Not CUDA -- `sacct` says `OUT_OF_ME+`, exit `0:125`,
`Detected N oom_kill events`, and the only Python output is a dataloader worker
dying of `ConnectionResetError`, which is the symptom. Measured: a list of
`(PosixPath, PosixPath)` pairs costs **694 bytes per pair**, so 4.2 M crops is
2.94 GB per process; `build_jz_loaders` runs `persistent_workers=True` with 9
workers per rank, i.e. 40 processes per node, and CPython writes a refcount into
an object header just to *read* it, so every worker steadily converts its
copy-on-write share into a private copy. It grows over epochs, which is why the
kill lands hours in. `PairIndex` in `train_distill_jz.py` stores the index as
three contiguous numpy byte arrays instead (87 bytes/pair, 8.0x smaller,
verified identical on all 961,139 local pairs and in iteration order). Do
**not** call `list()` on it -- `SAM3DStudentDataset` copies only real lists for
exactly this reason. Two corollaries: adding *any* per-node memory (the
`--w-verts` subset costs ~2 GiB across 4 ranks) decides only which arm dies
first, not whether one does; and `sacct` MaxRSS undersamples at ~30 s, so a
number well under the `mem=160000M` cgroup limit does not mean you are safe.

**rsync to the cluster lands files where you point it, and a misplaced trainer
fails silently.** `rsync ... a/b.py c/d.slurm host:REPO/` puts BOTH in
`REPO/`, not in `REPO/a/` and `REPO/c/`. A stray `train_distill_jz.py` in the
repo root is simply never imported, so the job runs the old code and raises
nothing -- on 2026-09-08 that silently discarded both a
`--constraint=v100-32g` fix and a logging change for a full generation. Check
the destination directory per file, and verify on the cluster with `grep -c
'<a string only the new version has>'` before submitting.

**Body shape is invisible to every geometric loss, and the fix is a vertex
term.** `MHRForwardPass.get_joints` zeroes the 45 `shape_params`, and that is
not a shortcut: they move the 127-joint skeleton by *exactly* `0.000e+00 cm`.
Measured `d(loss)/d(shape_params)` is `8.9e-03` through vertices and
`0.000e+00` through joints, so `--w-verts` is the ONLY route by which shape gets
a geometric gradient; ignoring identity costs 5.95 mm mean / 22.68 mm max PVE.
Do **not** reach for `models/mhr_assets/assets/lod6.fbx` to make it cheap — it
needs `pymomentum` (which segfaults here) and it is a different topology, so the
teacher correspondence would have to be fitted. `n_verts` instead takes a
farthest-point subset of the rig's OWN 18,439-vertex mesh and rewrites the three
flattened influence tables of the rig's own `linear_blend_skinning`; the op is
untouched, so the answer is bit-exact against the full mesh (4.6e-05 cm) and the
vertex ids match the teacher's. 595 vertices cost +0.6 ms per batch-64 step
against 16.7 ms for all 18,439. `loss_verts` belongs in `FK_LOSS_KEYS` — a
blown-up bone scale explodes vertices exactly as it explodes joints.

**`parameter_transform[:, :204]` has rank 192, not 204.** Twelve directions
move the parameters and leave the skeleton *exactly* unchanged — each
`*_flexible` parameter against its `scale_*` partner, plus the spine rotations.
Along them every geometric loss has zero gradient, so the model is regressing
12 dimensions of solver-arbitrary teacher noise that no image can determine.
Do **not** "fix" this by zeroing the `*_flexible` parameters even though the rig
pins them to `[0,0]`: the teacher genuinely uses them (`leg_length_flexible`
mean 0.32, max 1.64), so zeroing shortens every leg.

**`DistillationLoss` is never `.to(device)`'d.** `run_overfit_test`,
`run_self_tests`, `train_instant_hmr` and `train_distill_jz.train` all construct
it bare, so any buffer you register lands on the CPU and raises on step 1. Build
tensors on `mhr_module.device` instead.

**3DPW GT is the published protocol, and it is a cache on disk.** The pickles'
`jointPositions` field is the 24 SMPL *kinematic* joints, which is not what any
paper reports; `benchmark/make_3dpw_gt.py` precomputes the real reference (SMPL
forward + `J_regressor_h36m`) into `<3DPW root>/gt_h36m/`, and both the harness
and `val3dpw.py` default to it. Two consequences: a job whose 3DPW directory
lacks that cache raises at startup, and **numbers from before 2026-09-05 are ~13
mm apart from later ones** — `--val-3dpw-gt jointpositions` keeps a resumed run
on its original metric.

**Anything fitted over the 70 MHR keypoints needs float64 and a truncated
`lstsq`.** 40 of the 70 are finger joints millimetres apart, so the design
matrix is near-singular. Centring in float32 leaves a 0.04 mm residual in the
exact direction centring annihilates, `lstsq` keeps it as signal, and the J14
adapter went from 37 mm to 430 mm in-sample looking like a broken GT. Even in
float64 the unregularised fit reaches landmarks through ±2000 weights on
fingers; `RCOND` in `eval_3dpw.fit_adapter` truncates it to a rank-24 map with
weights under 1 at no measurable cost.

**The CLIFF conditioning is computed in three places and they must agree.**
`SAM3DStudentDataset.__getitem__`, `val3dpw._preprocess` and
`instanthmr.inference.InstantHMR._preprocess` each build the 3-vector
separately. Feeding a model trained on one variant with the other raises
nothing — it silently mis-places the person in depth. Since 2026-09-06 the
perspective-correct variant (`--cliff-focal`, config `cliff_focal`) is
mandatory for new runs, because the rebuilt corpus carries real per-image
focals spanning `f/diag` 0.6-1.8 where the pixel form is ambiguous; the old
corpus was constant at 1.000. See `instanthmr_distill_train/README.md`.

**Never rebuild a config from `DistillConfig()` defaults to load a checkpoint.**
Two 2026-09-06 flags make the defaults wrong, in opposite ways.
`--bound-scales` puts a `tanh` remap inside `forward()`, so a default-config
export reads the head's raw pre-`tanh` numbers as bone scales — measured 21.0
mm MPJPE / 14.4 mm PA-MPJPE of silent corruption. `--cliff-focal` changes what
the conditioning vector *means*, not the graph, so a mismatch raises nothing.
Use `T.config_from_checkpoint()`: it reads the bounds out of the weights
(`scale_lo`/`scale_hi` are the flag) and the conditioning form out of the
`run_config.json` beside the checkpoint, and `tools/pth_to_onnx.py` stamps the
latter into the ONNX metadata so `instanthmr.inference` configures itself.
Deployment has no annotation to read a focal from, so it falls back to
`1.05 x diag` for focal-aware graphs and `1.00 x diag` for pixel-conditioned
ones (that IS the old corpus's synthetic focal); `demo.py --focal` overrides.

**One reported number: J14 PA-MPJPE, adapter-applied, on the H36M GT.** The
training log, `summarize_runs.py` and `benchmark/eval_3dpw_ckpt.py` all print
it and they agree to the decimal. J12 was removed on 2026-09-06 — it was the
rig-clean row against the old GT and is not against this one. Runs started
before that date recorded J14 *without* the adapter, ~26 mm higher; do not put
old and new rows in one table.

**PA-MPJPE is blind to half of what a demo shows.** Procrustes removes
translation, rotation and scale, so `cam_trans` drift, body-size error and
temporal jitter are all invisible to it — and to root-relative MPJPE for the
first two. A change can be worth shipping on stability and move the benchmark
by 0.1 mm. Measure jitter directly (frame-to-frame acceleration on 3DPW's
consecutive frames, and the variance of rigid bone lengths within a person
track, which cannot change and so is pure noise).

**Seed spread is narrow at generation 8.** g8h_s0 vs g8h_s1 differ by 0.10 mm
on 3DPW test J14 (41.76 / 41.86) and 0.24 mm on EMDB-1 (46.93 / 46.69,
fit-free J14/H36M). The old "34–49 mm" warning was the 70-keypoint metric on
early generations and no longer applies. A seed sweep buys ~0.2 mm, so it is
not a way to gain accuracy; keep 2 seeds per arm only to tell a >0.5 mm change
from noise.

**You cannot reach Jean Zay.** No SSH, no Slurm. Print commands for the user and
read the logs they paste back. Files reach the cluster by `rsync` of *specific
files* — never the whole tree, since some files are edited on both sides.

**ONNX export constrains the model.** `torch.linalg.lstsq` and friends do not
export; use explicit small-matrix algebra. Pin `onnxruntime-gpu==1.26.0` — 1.27+
is CUDA 13 and silently falls back to CPU.

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues and specs live as local markdown files under `.scratch/<feature>/`, not GitHub Issues (the repo is public). See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

The five default roles, label string = role name (`needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, `wontfix`). See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context: one `CONTEXT.md` plus `docs/adr/` at the repo root, created lazily. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.
