# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

Matchimals.fun is an animal-matching puzzle card game shipped to iOS and the web. It's an [Expo](https://expo.dev) (SDK 56) React Native app written in TypeScript (strict mode), using [boardgame.io](https://boardgame.io) for turn-based game logic. Package manager is **bun**.

## Commands

```bash
bun install            # install deps
bun run ios            # build & run in iOS simulator (expo run:ios)
bun run web            # run web version (expo start --web)
bun run start          # expo dev server
bun run test           # jest (jest-expo preset, --passWithNoTests)
bun run typecheck      # tsc --noEmit (strict; keep this clean)
bun run format         # prettier on src/**
bun run generate:icons # re-render the app icons from the animal SVGs (outputs are committed)
bun run print:cards    # render the physical deck + DriveThruCards PDF/X-1a files (outputs in print/, gitignored)

bun run prebuild       # regenerate ios/ from app.json (expo prebuild -p ios --clean)
bun run build:web      # static web export to dist/ (expo export -p web)
bun run deploy:ios     # bump build number, archive, and upload to TestFlight (scripts/deploy-ios.sh)
```

Run a single test: `bun run test -- path/to/file.test.js` (or `-t "name"`). There is currently no test suite, so `test` passes with no tests.

Lint: `.eslintrc` extends `@react-native`; `lint-staged` runs prettier on commit (husky `precommit`).

## Continuous native generation

The `ios/` directory is **generated** from `app.json` (and the config plugins) — it is not the source of truth and is gitignored. Never hand-edit native iOS files expecting changes to persist; edit `app.json` or a config plugin and re-run `bun run prebuild`. Building requires Xcode + CocoaPods. Releases are built locally (no paid EAS): `bun run deploy:ios` auto-increments `ios.buildNumber`, archives, and uploads to TestFlight (signing and upload use the App Store Connect API key in `~/.private_keys` when present, else the Apple ID signed into Xcode — see README "Deploying to TestFlight"; key IDs and the .p8 never go in the repo); bump `version` in `app.json` manually for new releases. See the build-philosophy memory: no fastlane, no paid EAS.

`plugins/withFirebaseNoAdId.js` is a custom dangerous-mod plugin that prepends `$RNFirebaseAnalyticsWithoutAdIdSupport=true` to the Podfile so AdSupport.framework isn't linked (keeps the App Store privacy declaration clean). `plugins/withAnimalAppIcons.js` copies `assets/app-icons/animals/*.appiconset` into the asset catalog and lists them in `ASSETCATALOG_COMPILER_ALTERNATE_APPICON_NAMES` so iOS offers them as alternate app icons.

## Architecture

**Game state lives in boardgame.io, not React.** `src/Matchimals/game.ts` is the pure game definition (`setup`, `moves`, `turn.moveLimit: 1`, `endIf`), typed as boardgame.io's `Game<GameState>`; it also exports the `Card`-holding `GameState` shape. `src/App.tsx` wraps the board with `Client({ board: Matchimals, game, numPlayers })`. The board component (`src/Matchimals/index.tsx`) receives `BoardProps<GameState>` — `G` (game state), `ctx`, and `moves` — and calls `moves.placeCard(id)` / `moves.pass()` to mutate state. `G` is an Immer draft, so moves mutate it directly.

**The board model.** The play area is a fixed `columns × rows` (25 × 19, both must be odd) grid of `cells` — a flat array indexed `row * columns + col`. The first card is placed at `center`. Cards have four edges (`top/right/bottom/left`) holding animal IDs; two cards connect when touching edges share an ID. Core predicates in `game.ts`: `getNeighbors`, `isLegalMove`, `calculateScore` (sums `animals[id].score` per matching edge), `canCardsConnect`. The deck is one copy of `constants/cards.ts` per player, shuffled (lodash — there are TODOs to switch to boardgame.io's seeded RNG for future server play).

**Drag-and-drop → cell index.** Dropping a card doesn't carry a target cell; `onCardDrop` in `src/Matchimals/index.tsx` computes it geometrically from the dropped card's screen position vs. the scrollable `Table`'s offset (exposed via the typed `TableHandle` imperative API), dividing by `cardWidth`/`cardHeight` to get a `(row, col)`, then `row * columns + col`. `constants/board.ts` holds all these dimensions. If drag placement is off, this math (and the Table's measured offset) is the place to look.

**Platform splits via `.web.tsx`.** `Nameplate` has a web variant resolved automatically by Metro; the pair shares a props type in a sibling `types.ts` — when touching it, update both variants and keep the shared type honest. `Dialog` is a single Portal + Animated implementation on both platforms (RN's `Modal` collapses on Fabric, and the portal keeps native and web timings identical). (`Music` has no web variant — expo-audio works on both platforms, and `setAudioModeAsync` is a no-op on web.)

**Animals** (`src/Animals/`) are individual react-native-svg components taking `SvgProps`; `src/Animals/index.ts` is the registry, and `AnimalName` (`keyof typeof Animals`) ties it to `constants/animals.ts` and the player config. `src/hooks/players.tsx` assigns each of up to 4 players a random animal + color via a PlayerProvider context.

**App icons are the animals.** `scripts/generate-app-icons.mjs` renders every registered animal onto the table wood: the `defaultAppIcon` from `constants/appIcon.ts` becomes the primary icon (`assets/app-icons/Icon-App-1024x1024.png` + `public/icons/`), and every other animal an explicit-size `.appiconset` under `assets/app-icons/animals/` (no 1024 per alternate — each would add ~1 MB to the bundle). The iOS alternate-icon name is the `AnimalName`; `src/hooks/appIcon.ts` wraps `expo-alternate-app-icons` (null ⇄ `defaultAppIcon`), and the OS remembers the choice, so the app persists nothing. `AppIconChooser` opens from the `Settings` dialog (the cog beside the audio controls on the main menu and in the in-game menu; `Switch` is the on/off control used there), and only when `canChangeAppIcon` (iOS). Adding an animal to the registry means re-running `bun run generate:icons` and committing the output.

**Localization.** User-facing strings never appear inline: they come from `src/locales/<locale>.ts` through `t()` / `caps()` / `playersLabel()` / `animalName()` in `src/i18n.ts` (English `en.ts` defines the `Translations` interface; every locale must implement it). Titles and buttons are stored in natural case and capitalized at render with `caps()`. `AnimalName` stays the English key everywhere — translate only when rendering. Text styles spread `...displayFont` (Dimbo, or the bold platform font for Japanese/Korean/Chinese) instead of naming `"Dimbo"`. After touching strings run `bun run check:locales` (keys, Dimbo glyph coverage, measured slot widths, store-metadata limits) and regenerate `store/translations-review.md` with `bun scripts/translations-review.mjs`; `bun run screenshots:locales` photographs every language on the simulators. The marketing site's gameplay recorder (`scripts/record-gameplay/play.mjs` there) plays the web build in every storefront's language, so it finds nothing by text: the main menu's player buttons by their 128 px size and order, the nameplate avatars by their 80 px circles, and the avatar chooser's tiles by their 84 px size in `src/Animals/index.ts` registry order. Keep those stable, or update the recorder alongside.

## Conventions

- **This is a public GitHub repo.** Before every commit, review the diff for anything private — credentials, API key IDs, tokens, personal info, internal URLs. Nothing secret is needed on disk for releases; never put credentials in tracked files, commit messages, or PR descriptions.
- Prettier (default config, `.prettierrc`) — let `bun run format` handle style; don't hand-format.
- Comments only where they explain what the code can't (constraints, invariants, non-obvious "why"). Never change-relative: no references to previous behavior or why the new way differs from the old — the codebase is forward-looking; git history is the changelog.
- Components are folders with an `index.tsx`; assets (png/jpg/svg/mp4) live beside the component that uses them. Asset imports are declared in `src/declarations.d.ts`.
- TypeScript is strict (`tsconfig.json` extends Expo's base + `"strict": true`); run `bun run typecheck` before committing. Prefer narrow local types over `any`; the deliberate escape hatches (e.g. web-only CSS values cast past RN's style types) carry comments.
- The Expo config plugin (`plugins/withFirebaseNoAdId.js`) and babel/metro/jest configs stay JS — they run in Node at build time and are excluded from the TS program.
