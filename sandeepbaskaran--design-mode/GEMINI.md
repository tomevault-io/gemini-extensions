# CLAUDE.md — Project guide for Design Mode

Project-level instructions for anyone (or any AI assistant) working
on Design Mode. Personal/per-maintainer workflow preferences live
outside the repo — this file is purely about the project.

If you're a contributor using Claude Code (or any CLAUDE.md-aware
tool), these rules are read automatically at session start.

---

## Workspaces

- `packages/extension` — Chrome MV3 side-panel extension (the main
  surface). TypeScript, Vite, no framework.
- `packages/mcp-local` — Local MCP companion + WebSocket bridge.
  Node.js, TypeScript.
- `packages/mcp-cloud` — Hosted MCP relay (Vercel-deployable).
- `packages/shared` — Types, message schemas, constants. Re-exported
  via `@shared/...`.
- `website/` — Next.js 15 / React 19 / Tailwind 4 / shadcn-ui
  (new-york) marketing + docs + interactive demo site. Light mode
  only; the `dark:` variants still present in shadcn primitives
  are inert (no `.dark` class is ever added to the root).

## Default build commands

- **One build, one `dist/`, one manifest — serves BOTH Chrome and
  Firefox.** Each browser reads its own manifest keys and ignores the
  other's; the JS detects the browser at **runtime**
  (`src/platform/target.ts` → `IS_FIREFOX`, UA + `sidebarAction`
  sniff). There is no separate Firefox build or `dist-firefox/`.
- **Build the extension:** `node build.mjs` from `packages/extension/`
  (NOT from the repo root — `build.mjs` lives inside the package).
  → `dist/`.
- **Single merged manifest** (`public/manifest.json`) carries both
  browsers' keys: Chrome uses `side_panel` + `sidePanel` permission +
  `background.service_worker`; Firefox uses `sidebar_action` +
  `background.scripts` + `browser_specific_settings` (Gecko id
  `sandeepbaskaran98@gmail.com`, `strict_min_version` 121.0, and
  `data_collection_permissions: { required: ["none"] }` — AMO rejects new
  submissions without it). The
  `background` block carries **both** `service_worker` and `scripts`
  (each browser picks its own). Don't split this into per-target
  manifests.
- **API layer:** the extension calls the promise-based `browser.*`
  namespace everywhere (webextension-polyfill on Chrome, native on
  Firefox — imported first in each entry via `src/platform/polyfill.ts`).
  `browser` is typed as `typeof chrome`. A handful of Chrome-only APIs
  stay on the `chrome` global: `chrome.sidePanel` (behind the
  `platform/panel.ts` adapter), `chrome.storage.session.setAccessLevel`,
  `chrome.extension.isAllowedFileSchemeAccess`. Firefox's
  `sidebarAction` is reached via a cast in `platform/panel.ts`.
- **Pop-out floating window + Picture-in-Picture are Chrome-only**
  (Firefox has neither `sidePanel` nor Document PiP) — those controls
  are gated behind `!IS_FIREFOX` at runtime (present in the shared
  bundle but dormant on Firefox; the docked sidebar is Firefox's sole
  surface). Alt+D opens the panel on both: Chrome via the side panel,
  Firefox via `sidebarAction.open()` called synchronously in the
  command handler.
- **`IS_FIREFOX` (`src/platform/target.ts`) is the single flag for any
  Chrome/Firefox-divergent behaviour** — UI copy, links, or feature
  gating. Always branch on it; never add ad-hoc `navigator.userAgent`
  checks elsewhere. Current divergences that use it: pop-out / PiP
  (hidden on FF), the eyedropper "Pick" button (hidden on FF — no
  EyeDropper API), the side-panel open adapter (`platform/panel.ts`),
  the keyboard-shortcut open path (`background/index.ts`), the
  file-access settings button (`about:addons` vs `chrome://extensions`),
  and the Contribute panel's "Review" link + share text (AMO vs Chrome
  Web Store). New browser-specific behaviour goes through this flag.
- **Build the website:** `npm run build` from `website/`.
- **Repo-wide gate:** `npm run verify` from repo root — runs
  `scripts/prepublish-check.mjs` which chains: build extension →
  bundle integrity → manifest sanity (asserts BOTH Chrome + Firefox
  keys) → `web-ext lint` (0 errors required; the ~30 warnings —
  `innerHTML`, Chrome-only `UNSUPPORTED_API`, the ignored `sidePanel`
  permission, `BACKGROUND_SERVICE_WORKER_IGNORED`, and the advisory
  `KEY_FIREFOX_UNSUPPORTED_BY_MIN_VER` for `data_collection_permissions`
  — are expected) →
  MCP local checks → build local MCP → bundle integrity → build
  website → export integrity. CI uses the same command.
- **Two store zips, identical content, distinct names** (both under
  `packages/extension/`, both gitignored): `design-mode-extension.zip`
  (Chrome Web Store, `npm run package:extension`) and
  `design-mode-addon.zip` (Firefox / AMO + local `about:debugging`
  testing, `npm run package:extension:firefox`).
  `npm run package:extension:all` builds once and writes both.
  They're byte-for-byte the same dist — the split is purely so each
  store gets a recognisably-named file. Replace the existing zips;
  never produce per-version copies like `design-mode-v1.0.2.zip`.
  `npm run lint:extension` builds + runs `web-ext lint`.
- **TypeScript typecheck has a known pre-existing failure** because
  `packages/shared` lacks `composite: true`. `npm run verify` does
  NOT run `tsc` on shared, so CI is fine. Don't "fix" this
  incidentally.

## Code conventions

- **No comments describing WHAT the code does** — well-named
  identifiers cover that. Only add comments when WHY is non-obvious
  (hidden constraint, subtle invariant, workaround for a specific
  bug, behaviour that would surprise a reader).
- **No multi-paragraph docstrings.** One short line max.
- Don't reference the current task / fix / callers in code comments
  ("used by X", "added for the Y flow") — those belong in the PR
  description and rot fast.
- No unused / dead code. If something is unused, delete it.
- No backwards-compat shims (renaming `_var`, re-exporting old
  types, leaving "// removed" stubs).
- No error handling for impossible scenarios — trust internal calls
  and framework guarantees. Validate only at system boundaries
  (user input, external APIs).
- Three similar lines is better than a premature abstraction.

## Security & privacy baseline

- **The side panel context is privileged.** It holds `chrome.tabs`,
  `scripting`, `storage`, and the MCP bearer token. Treat every
  value flowing into it from a page as untrusted.
- **Page-derived HTML** → `sanitizeRichTextHtml`
  (`packages/extension/src/sidepanel/sidepanel.ts`). Don't ever
  interpolate raw `el.innerHTML` from an inspected page directly
  into the panel's DOM.
- **Page-derived values into HTML attributes** → `escapeAttr`
  (`packages/extension/src/content/helpers.ts`).
- **Page-derived values into CSS contexts** (inline `style="..."`)
  → `safeCssColor` (same file as the sanitizer). `escapeAttr`
  alone is NOT sufficient for CSS contexts.
- **Never add `eval`, `new Function`, inline event handlers**, or
  any dynamic-code execution path. MV3's default CSP forbids most
  of this anyway; the explicit `content_security_policy` block in
  `manifest.json` is defense in depth.
- **No new outbound network calls without an opt-in setting AND a
  note in PRIVACY.md.** Default behaviour is localhost-only.
- **No new manifest permissions without a justification.** The
  current set (activeTab, storage, scripting, tabs, sidePanel,
  host_permissions: <all_urls>) is what's reviewed by the Chrome
  Web Store; any addition needs store-listing rationale too.
- **No secrets in repo.** `.env*` are gitignored; treat anything
  else in the repo as public. The cloud bearer token (`dm_...`) is
  generated client-side and stored in `chrome.storage.local` — never
  hardcoded.
- **Licence**: MIT. Don't add deps with incompatible licences.

## Monorepo patterns

- **Shared constants** live in `packages/shared/src/constants.ts`
  (re-exported via `@shared/constants`). Things like
  `DEFAULT_SHORTCUTS`, `APP_VERSION`, animation/transition option
  arrays. Synchronise embedded constants across packages instead of
  duplicating.
- **Synthetic CSS props for non-CSS-native features** — established
  pattern for things CSS can't represent natively:
  - `__layout_guides` → `::before` overlay via the layout-guides
    module (session-only, bypasses change-tracker by design).
  - `__effect_overlay` → `::after` overlay for Noise / Texture
    (routes through change-tracker so it lands in Changes tab and
    persists).
  - `__stroke_color__N` / `__stroke_weight__N` / `__fill_color__N` /
    `__guide_*__N` — per-layer virtual props that intercept in
    `applyStyle()` (sidepanel.ts) and route to per-element stashes.

  When adding a new such feature, follow the existing pattern:
  intercept in `applyStyle`, store in a `Map<elementId, …>`,
  dispatch via either change-tracker (persistent) or a separate
  message (session-only).
- **Message routing**: side panel → background → content. The
  background script in `packages/extension/src/background/` is a
  forwarder; every new `SP_*` message needs a matching forward rule.

## Canonical URLs

- **Marketing site**: `https://designmode.app`. Never
  `design-mode.dev`, `designmode.dev`, or any hyphenated/`.dev`
  variant — those are wrong.
- **Cloud relay**: `https://mcp.designmode.app` (apex). The `www.`
  subdomain also serves the routes, but apex is canonical since
  the 307 redirect was killed at the Vercel domain layer. All
  user-facing copy + config snippets must use the apex form.

## MCP modes + agent presence

- **Three modes**: **Cloud (default)**, **Local**, **Self-hosted**.
  Fresh installs land on Cloud. Existing users keep whatever
  `dm-mcp-mode` was stored. UI order in the Settings picker and
  on the website's `/mcp` page is Cloud · Local · Self-hosted.
- **Three-state `mcpState`** (`packages/extension/src/sidepanel/sidepanel.ts`):
  - `offline` — transport (WS / SSE) is down.
  - `running` — transport up, no agent activity seen recently.
  - `connected` — transport up AND an `AGENT_PRESENCE` event was
    received within the last 5 minutes. Send-to-Agent button only
    enables in this state.
- **Local presence**: `packages/mcp-local/src/websocket-server.ts`
  sends a `HELLO` message on every WS connection with
  `agentConnected: true`. The local server is spawned by the MCP
  client process, so "WS open" ≡ "agent attached" — no separate
  presence machine.
- **Cloud / Self-hosted presence**: `packages/mcp-cloud/lib/presence.ts`
  `bumpPresence` / `getPresence` over Redis. 5-min TTL key per
  tenant (`presence:{tenantId}`). Every `/api/mcp` POST bumps the
  key; 0→1 transitions publish an inbound `AGENT_PRESENCE` event
  via `publishInbound`. The extension SSE stream
  (`api/extension/stream.ts`) sends initial presence on connect
  and polls every 30s for 1→0 (TTL expiry) edges.
- **Extension side**: `content/change-tracker.ts` owns an
  `agentConnected` boolean. The content script handles incoming
  `AGENT_PRESENCE` and `HELLO` messages and broadcasts
  `AGENT_PRESENCE_UPDATE` via `chrome.runtime.sendMessage`. The
  side panel listens for that message and re-derives `mcpState`.

## Self-hosted relay

- The `packages/mcp-cloud` code is **Node.js + Redis**, runnable
  on any host (Vercel, Railway, Fly, your own VM, etc). Don't
  write user-facing copy that names Vercel as the only target.
- The in-repo dev workflow (`npm run dev:mcp-cloud` →
  `npx vercel dev`) and the `lib/kv.ts` comment about
  `REDIS_URL` being auto-injected by the Vercel Marketplace are
  internal references — those stay Vercel-flavoured because
  that's our reference setup, but production users can deploy
  anywhere.

## Website conventions

- **Background slabs** (`website/src/components/background.tsx`):
  each page wraps ONLY its hero in `<Background>` (yellow
  gradient at top) and ONLY its final section in
  `<Background variant="bottom">`. Never wrap the whole page —
  the gradient height scales with the wrapped div, so a long page
  shows yellow far past the hero. The middle of each page renders
  in a plain `<section>` with no Background wrap.
- **Product Hunt badge**: lives in two places — the homepage
  `<Hero />` block (above the h1) and the global `<Footer />`
  block (above the h2). Single shared atom in
  `components/blocks/product-hunt.tsx`. PH re-stamps the badge URL
  with a `t=` tracking param each render — use a plain `<img>`
  (`<Image>` from next/image would need `api.producthunt.com` in
  `next.config.ts` `images.remotePatterns` for no benefit).
- **Hydration warning**: `<html lang="en" suppressHydrationWarning>`
  in `layout.tsx` is intentional. Night-mode browser extensions
  (Night Eye, Dark Reader variants) inject attributes like
  `data-nm-theme="dark"` on the root after SSR, which React would
  otherwise warn about. `suppressHydrationWarning` scopes to the
  `<html>` element's attributes only — subtree mismatches still
  fire.
- **Single shared lockfile**: only one `package-lock.json` lives
  in the repo, at the root. `npm workspaces` handles `website/`
  plus every package from there. If a workspace ever ends up with
  its own `package-lock.json` (the template bootstrap put one
  inside `website/` once), delete it before committing — Next.js's
  build warns about ambiguous workspace root.
- **Content-driven pages + LLM-SEO infra**: the `/blog`, `/compare`,
  `/docs`, and `/use-cases` index + `[slug]` routes are generated from
  `website/src/content/{blog,comparisons,docs,use-cases}.ts` — add an
  entry there rather than a new page file. The SEO surface is the Next
  metadata routes `app/{robots,sitemap,manifest}.ts`, static
  `public/llms.txt` + `public/llms-full.txt`, and per-page structured
  data via `components/site/json-ld.tsx`. When you add a content route,
  keep the slug list in `sitemap.ts` in sync. New pages still follow the
  background-slab rule above.

## Documentation conventions

- **CHANGELOG.md** — release-notes file. Add new releases at the top
  in reverse-chronological order. Format:
  `## [x.y.z] — YYYY-MM-DD` with Added / Changed / Fixed / Security
  / Internal subsections.
- **RELEASING.md** — the release procedure: version-bump
  recommendation, files a bump touches, pre-tag checklist, and
  tagging + release-zip steps. Read before cutting a release.
- **CHANGES.md** — user-facing reference for the Changes-tab UI (not
  a changelog). Don't confuse them.
- **PRIVACY.md** — source of truth for what data leaves the user's
  machine. Update on any new network call, new `chrome.storage` key,
  or new external service.
- **SECURITY.md** — disclosure process and contributor security
  expectations (no eval / `new Function`, CSP rules, page-trust
  boundary, etc.).
- **DESIGN-PANEL.md, FEATURES.md, PARITY.md** — user-facing feature
  docs. Update when a section moves / splits / renames (e.g. when
  Motion was split out of Effects in 1.0.2).
- **README.md** — non-technical install + "What is it" intro at the
  top, technical content gated behind "For contributors &
  developers". Don't merge the two audiences back together.
- **docs/e2e-testcases.md** — manual regression test plan. New
  features need new Phase rows; new shortcuts need new Phase 0.10
  rows.

## Contributor surface

- **Issue / PR templates** live in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` (YAML
  issue forms, not legacy markdown). `config.yml` disables blank
  issues, routes Security to SECURITY.md, and Q&A to /discussions.
  The bug template requires a **Diagnostics** block — produce it via
  the side panel's Help → "Copy diagnostics" button.
- **In-panel Help view** — `?` icon in the header (lucide
  `helpCircle`, already in `packages/extension/src/content/icons.ts`)
  opens a full-panel overlay mirroring the Settings pattern: state
  boolean (`helpOpen`), `renderHelpView()`, action handlers `help` /
  `back-from-help` / `copy-diagnostics`. Help and Settings are
  mutually exclusive — opening one closes the other.
- **Copy diagnostics** payload is environment metadata only
  (`APP_VERSION`, `navigator.*`, current theme). No PII, no page
  URL, no extension state. `navigator.clipboard.writeText` — no new
  permission.

## Label taxonomy

- **Triage state** (issues + PRs): `triage`, `needs-info`,
  `needs-repro`, `stale`.
- **Scope / area**: `scope:extension`, `scope:mcp-local`,
  `scope:mcp-cloud`, `scope:shared`, `scope:website`, `scope:docs`,
  `scope:build`.
- **Type** (issues): defaults (`bug`, `enhancement`,
  `documentation`, `duplicate`, `invalid`, `wontfix`, `question`,
  `good first issue`, `help wanted`) + `security`, `regression`,
  `breaking-change`.
- **PR-only**: `dependencies` (Dependabot auto-applies),
  `pinned`, `wip`.

No `priority:*` labels — premature for current volume.

## CI / dependency hygiene

- **CI gate** is `npm run verify`. `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs
  it on PRs + push to main. If `verify` passes locally, CI passes.
  Don't duplicate `verify`'s steps in the workflow — keep one
  source of truth.
- **CodeQL** runs PR / push / weekly. Non-blocking. Findings live
  in the Security tab; triage like compiler warnings.
- **Dependabot** opens weekly grouped patch/minor PRs across every
  workspace + `github-actions`. Majors stay separate. No auto-merge.
- **Stale workflow** labels inactive issues after 45 days (closes at
  52); PRs after 14 days (closes at 30, converts to draft on first
  stale-mark). Exempts `pinned`, `security`, `help wanted`,
  `good first issue`, `regression`, `wip`.
- **Release workflow** fires on `v*.*.*` tag push: builds the
  extension → zips `design-mode-extension.zip` + `design-mode-addon.zip`
  (`package:extension:all`, identical content) → creates a GitHub
  Release with both attached (Chrome Web Store + AMO). The tag push is
  the maintainer's explicit consent; the workflow only fires after it.
  Store uploads are manual (see RELEASING.md).

## Release readiness

Releases are gated on the maintainer's explicit consent — never
auto-trigger a tag or release. The full procedure — version-bump
recommendation, the files a bump touches, the pre-tag checklist, and
tagging + release-zip steps — lives in **RELEASING.md**. Read it
before cutting a release.

## GitHub Discussions

Enabled on the public repo. The "Question or discussion" contact
link in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml` points there. Default
categories (Announcements / General / Ideas / Polls / Q&A /
Show & tell) are canonical — don't customise without a reason.
