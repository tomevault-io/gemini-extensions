# AGENTS.md

## Purpose

This repository is **Airwave**: a FastAPI backend plus a Vue/Vite frontend that exposes one shared live MP3 stream for all connected clients. Users can add single YouTube URLs or playlist URLs into a shared queue, and Sonos devices consume the same stream URL as browsers.

Use this file as the default working guide for code agents in this repo. Keep changes small, targeted, and easy to verify.

## Stack

- Backend: Python 3.10+, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Jinja2, `soco`
- Frontend: Vue 3, Vue Router, Vite, `@nuxt/ui`
- Runtime tools: `yt-dlp`, `deno`, `ffmpeg`
- Storage: SQLite by default via `AIRWAVE_DB_URL`

## Repository Map

- `app/main.py`: app factory, shared service wiring, startup lifecycle
- `app/api/routes.py`: HTTP and websocket endpoints, request models, response shaping
- `app/core/config.py`: environment-backed settings and public stream URL logic
- `app/db/repository.py`: persistence and queue/history/playlist database operations
- `app/services/playlist_service.py`: URL ingestion, playlist preview/import, queue construction
- `app/services/stream_engine.py`: playback loop and shared stream state
- `app/services/yt_dlp_service.py`: YouTube metadata, playlist inspection, source resolution
- `app/services/sonos_service.py`: Sonos discovery and control
- `frontend/src/App.vue`: root UI state orchestration
- `frontend/src/components/`: UI panels and reusable Vue components
- `frontend/src/composables/useApi.js`: shared fetch helper for frontend API calls
- `app/templates/index.html`: server-rendered shell that hosts the frontend build
- `app/static/dist/`: built frontend assets served by FastAPI
- `scripts/run_dev.sh`: local dev launcher; builds frontend assets if needed, then runs `uvicorn`
- `tests/`: Python tests
- `tests_e2e/`: end-to-end browser coverage

## Working Agreements

- Preserve the shared-stream model. Do not accidentally turn `/stream/live.mp3` into a per-client stream.
- Keep route, service, and repository responsibilities separated:
  - `routes.py` should validate input, call services/repository methods, and shape API responses.
  - `services/` should contain business logic and orchestration.
  - `repository.py` should own database read/write behavior.
- Prefer extending existing helpers and serializers before adding parallel code paths.
- Avoid unrelated refactors when fixing one behavior.
- Keep API payload shapes stable unless the task explicitly requires a contract change.
- Follow existing naming and style in the touched file instead of normalizing the whole codebase.

## Run And Test

### Initial setup

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
python -m pip install ".[dev]"
npm install
./scripts/setup_yt_dlp.sh
./scripts/setup_deno.sh
```

Optional:

```bash
./scripts/setup_ffmpeg.sh
```

### Local development

```bash
./scripts/run_dev.sh
```

This script activates `.venv` when present, builds frontend assets if `app/static/dist/app.js` is missing, then starts:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:create_app --factory --reload --no-access-log
```

### Common validation

- Test execution rule (match `README.md`):
  - Activate virtualenv first: `source .venv/bin/activate`
  - Ensure dev deps are installed: `python -m pip install ".[dev]"`
  - Then run tests with venv Python: `python -m pytest`
  - Do not assume global `python`/`pytest` exists outside `.venv`.
- Backend tests: `python -m pytest`
- Frontend build check: `npm run build`
- Frontend dev server when needed: `npm run dev`
- Frontend preview when needed: `npm run preview`

If you change Vue files, composables, or router behavior, run `npm run build` so `app/static/dist` stays in sync with the served app.

## Backend Conventions

- Add new HTTP schemas near related endpoints in `app/api/routes.py` using Pydantic models.
- Reuse the existing request-app-state pattern instead of creating ad hoc globals. Routes currently access shared services through `request.app.state`.
- Keep response serialization consistent with the existing `_serialize_*` helpers in `app/api/routes.py`.
- Queue and playlist ingestion logic belongs in `PlaylistService`, not directly in route handlers.
- YouTube resolution and playlist inspection belong in `YtDlpService`.
- Database mutations should flow through `Repository` methods and typed helper objects such as `NewQueueItem` and `NewPlaylistEntry`.
- Environment-dependent behavior should be driven through `app/core/config.py` and `AIRWAVE_*` variables rather than hardcoded paths or URLs.
- Be careful with long-running or streaming code. Client disconnects and shutdown behavior are expected cases, not exceptional failures.

## Frontend Conventions

- `frontend/src/App.vue` is the main coordinator for queue, history, playlists, playback state, and Sonos state. Avoid duplicating global state in multiple components.
- Use `fetchJson` from `frontend/src/composables/useApi.js` for API requests unless there is a strong reason not to.
- Keep presentational logic inside components and shared request/state utilities inside composables.
- Prefer keeping UI action logic in the component that renders the control when behavior is local to that component; emit events when parent coordination is required for shared state, navigation, or cross-component side effects.
- Match the existing Vue style in touched files. Current code uses `<script setup>`, double quotes, and composition API primitives.
- When adding UI that depends on backend payloads, verify the shape against the API response instead of assuming fields.
- Use in-app modals (e.g. `UModal`) for confirmations and editing flows. Do not use browser `confirm()`, `alert()`, or `prompt()` so that UX stays consistent with the rest of the app.

### Frontend Theme System

- Theme styles live under `frontend/src/css/`:
  - Shared/global stylesheet: `frontend/src/css/style.css`
  - Per-theme files: `frontend/src/css/themes/*.css`
- Prefer adding a **new theme file** in `frontend/src/css/themes/` over growing one large monolithic CSS file.
- Keep each theme self-contained with variables for:
  - App shell/surfaces (`--app-*`)
  - Nuxt UI tokens (`--ui-*` and `--ui-color-*`) so `UButton`, `UTabs`, and related components change with the selected theme.
- Theme state is managed by `frontend/src/composables/useTheme.js` and persisted in local storage under `airwave:settings:theme`.
- Current theme names:
  - `night`: legacy/current theme
  - `dark`: new default theme when no saved preference exists
- Theme selection UI lives at `frontend/src/pages/settings.vue`.
- When adding a new theme:
  - Create `frontend/src/css/themes/<theme-name>.css`
  - Import it from `frontend/src/css/style.css`
  - Add it to `supportedThemes` in `frontend/src/composables/useTheme.js`
  - Expose it in the `/settings` theme selector

## Change Guidance

- For backend-only changes:
  - Prefer targeted tests in `tests/`.
  - Verify that queue, history, playlist, and stream-related payloads remain backward compatible.
- For frontend-only changes:
  - Build the frontend and check for runtime errors in the rendered app.
  - Remember that FastAPI serves built assets from `app/static/dist`, not directly from `frontend/src`.
- For cross-stack changes:
  - Update both the API contract and the consuming Vue code in the same change.
  - Manually sanity-check the user flow end to end if it touches queueing, playback state, playlists, or Sonos controls.

## Safety Checklist

Before finishing work:

- Run the smallest relevant validation command for the files you changed.
- If frontend code changed, run `npm run build`.
- If backend behavior changed, activate `.venv` and run `python -m pytest` (or a focused subset) with the virtualenv Python.
- Call out any validation you could not run.
- Do not edit generated/built output manually unless the task specifically requires it.
- Do not commit local secrets, `.env` contents, binaries, or database files unless the user explicitly asks for that.
