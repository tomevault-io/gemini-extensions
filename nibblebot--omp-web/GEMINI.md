# AGENTS.md

Orientation for agents working in this repo. Read before editing. README.md is the user-facing doc; this file is the engineering map: commands, layout, wire contract, invariants, conventions, verification.

## What this repo is

Two products in one tree, sharing one Solid.js web UI and one wire contract:

- **omp-session** (`server/`): single-session agent daemon. One process, one project dir (bound at spawn, immutable), one live agent session via the `@oh-my-pi/pi-coding-agent` SDK **in-process** (`createAgentSession`: no child process, no JSON-RPC hop). Serves the full standalone UI over SSE + POST.
- **omp-fleet** (`fleet/`): registry + supervisor + connector for N daemons (local children, external/remote). Re-exposes them to the same UI in **roster mode** and to CLI fan-out. Holds **zero agent state**. All truth lives in the omp-session processes and their `.jsonl` session logs.
- **Web UI** (`src/`): one Solid.js bundle serves both modes; mode is decided by the wire (`roster` frame ⇒ roster mode, sticky; a bare omp-session never sends it ⇒ standalone). No router.

Runtime is **Bun** (`type: module`, `bun.lock` committed). No CI. Lint runs through **oxlint** (`.oxlintrc.json`; Solid rules come from `eslint-plugin-solid` loaded as an oxlint JS plugin) and formatting through **oxfmt** (`.oxfmtrc.json`: tabs, print width 100, TS/TSX only: markdown/CSS/HTML/JSON stay hand-maintained). Comments reference audit findings as `finding #N` (numbering kept from the 2026-08 audit).

## Commands

```sh
bun install                    # once
bun run dev                    # roster mode: vite (HMR, /events+/command proxied to fleet edge) + omp-fleet, ports chosen per-run; fleet state/lock scoped per worktree under the data home (dev-fleets/<slug>-<hash8>/), so N worktrees + the user's real fleet coexist; config and managed workspaces stay shared
bun run dev:single             # standalone: omp-session (--watch) + vite (proxies /events+/command+/download), ports chosen per-run
bun run dev:server             # just the daemon, --watch
bun run dev:web                # just vite
bun run check:types            # tsgo -p tsconfig.json --noEmit  (tsgo = @typescript/native-preview, NOT tsc)
bun run lint                   # oxlint (.oxlintrc.json); warnings only don't fail the run
bun run format                 # oxfmt, writes in place (TS/TSX only)
bun run format:check           # oxfmt --check, exits nonzero on unformatted files
bun run test                   # scripts/test.ts wrapper → bun test (see Testing)
bun scripts/test.ts --bail 1   # extra args forwarded to bun test (file filters work: `bun scripts/test.ts server/omp-session.test.ts`)
bun run bench                  # scripts/bench-tests.ts: run [--runs N]|report [--last N]|flakes [--last N]|baseline; per-file stats (mean/sd/p50/p95/CV%, Welch t vs baseline), flake/broken classification, JSONL history in .bench/
bun run build                  # → dist-bundle/cli.js installable bundle (vite build → regenerate server/embedded-dist.ts → bun build, dist/ + @oh-my-pi/* external; shebang verified)
bun run build:web              # vite build → dist/ (gitignored; the UI half of `build`)
bun scripts/test-onboard.ts    # OFFLINE distribution+onboarding E2E: pack → poisoned-store pinned install → first-run config → bare serve → spawn → update round-trip (exit 0 = green)
bun run fleet -- serve|sessions|projects|spawn|add-repo|add|provision|stop|remove|rm-project|add-worktree|rm-worktree|prompt
bun run collab [-- --join|--stop]   # collab room CLI (TUI/CLI-only surface)
```

Ports: defaults vite **4713**, omp-session **4721**, omp-fleet **4722** (used by `dev:web`/`dev:server`/`fleet -- serve` run directly). The `dev`/`dev:single` runners instead pick ports per-run so parallel worktrees don't collide: backends bind port 0 (ephemeral; the real port is parsed from the `OMP_SESSION|` line / "fleet listening" banner), vite gets a probe-picked port with `--strictPort`, a pre-ready exit is retried on a fresh port (bounded), and vite learns backend ports via `OMP_DEV_FLEET_PORT`/`OMP_DEV_SESSION_PORT` env in `vite.config.ts`. Fleet state is scoped per worktree too: `OMP_FLEET_STATE` → `<config dir>/dev-fleets/<slug>-<hash8>/fleet-state.json` (slug = worktree basename, hash8 = sha256 of the worktree realpath; deterministic, so dev restarts reuse the same fleet), which also scopes the pidfile lock (`<state>.lock`), so several worktrees' dev fleets and the user's real fleet on the shared data home run side by side; nothing is written into the repo. Only the state is scoped (the lock guards just that file), so the config file (read-only) and the managed-worktree root stay shared across all fleets, workspaces coordinate at path level (`.omp-web-repo` markers, existing-target refusal, git's no-double-checkout), and any fleet can discover/manage worktrees another fleet created; orphaned `dev-fleets/` dirs left by deleted worktrees are inert (safe to delete by hand once their dev stack is stopped; no auto-GC). Dev mode: `bun run dev` sets `OMP_FLEET_LOCAL_TEMPLATE` so sidebar-spawned daemons run `bun server/index.ts` from the checkout (not `--watch`ed, restart to pick up server edits); `--host`/`--allow-hosts` bind vite to the network (backends stay loopback; see README for the tailscale host-check note).

## Repo layout

| Path | Role |
| --- | --- |
|`cli/`|Installed-entrypoint surface: `omp-web.ts` dispatcher (bare/`serve` + fleet verbs → `fleet/cli.ts`; `session` → `server/index.ts`; `update` → `cli/update.ts`), `version.ts` (define-stamped version resolution), `update.ts` (release-manifest self-update)|

| `shared/sse.ts` | SSE framing (`encodeSseEvent`/`parseSseUnits`) + byte-bounded `SseRing` replay |
| `shared/testkit.ts` | `tempDir(prefix)` tracked-tempdir helper: tests MUST use it instead of raw mkdtemp (registered `afterAll` removes every tracked dir) |
| `server/index.ts` | The daemon: bootstrap, `/events` + `/command`, dispatch + resync, `/download` jail, auth, readiness gate, idle auto-exit |
| `server/methods.ts` | `METHODS` dispatch table (61 `WebMethodName` rows) + `READ_ONLY` + `HISTORY_RELOAD` + `NOT_READY_GATED` sets |
| `server/config.ts` | Flag/env surface (`--flag` maps 1:1 to `OMP_SESSION_*` env) |
| `server/sse-delivery.ts` | Consumer registry, delta seqs, ring replay, broadcast, chunked history priming |
| `server/settings-model.ts` | TUI `/settings` parity model + side effects |

| `server/ui-context.ts` | ExtensionUIContext dialogs → `ui_request`/`ui_response` frames |
| `server/collab-*.ts` | Collab host adapter / WS relay / session port / CLI. Only WebSocket left in the daemon (non-goal of the SSE plan) |
| `server/daemon-broker.ts` | `daemons` roster broadcast (hub-launch processes), polled every 3s while streams are live |
| `server/embedded-dist.ts` | **Stub** (`{}`) checked in; `bun run build` (`scripts/build-omp-web.ts`) regenerates it with `with { type: "file" }` imports and restores the stub in a `finally`. Never hand-edit beyond the stub |
| `fleet/registry.ts` | Persistent insertion-ordered roster + registered `projects[]` (`~/.omp-web/fleet-state.json`, atomic tmp+rename; monotonic `pN` project ids) |
| `fleet/supervisor.ts` | Spawns/restarts omp-session children via templates, parses `OMP_SESSION|` lines, git polling |
| `fleet/connector.ts` | Per-daemon SSE client: status ladder, backoff, silence deadline, Last-Event-ID resume |
| `fleet/edge.ts` | Browser-facing half: `/events` downlink, `/command` uplink, per-browser daemon proxy pipes, aggregated `daemons` frame |
| `fleet/server.ts` | Loopback control plane `:4722`: `/ctl/*` routes (incl. `/ctl/projects[/:id]`, `/ctl/projects/:id/worktrees`, `/ctl/worktrees/:daemonId[/delete-info]`), wiring, boot reconcile |
| `fleet/stats/` | Read-only historical transcripts/stats API (stats.db + session `.jsonl` files), mounted at `/ctl/stats/*` by `fleet/server.ts` |
| `fleet/cli.ts` | CLI over `/ctl/*` (loopback HTTP client) |
| `fleet/spawn-parse.ts` | Template fill, `OMP_SESSION|` parsing, endpoint resolution (pure) |
| `fleet/discovery.ts` | Project/worktree discovery, git state probing |
| `fleet/worktrees.ts` | Managed-worktree path mapping + lifecycle (`slugifyWorktreeName`/`managedWorktreePath`, `.omp-web-repo` collision markers, `resolveBaseRef`/`createWorktree`/`listUnregisteredWorktrees`/`deleteWorktree` + guard evidence; `git branch -d` only) + shared roster registration (`registerWorktreeEntry`, `registerProjectMainEntry` default workspace) |
| `fleet/omp-check.ts` | First-run omp-stack probe (serve offer): `omp` binary, auth-usable providers, default-role model; SDK via lazy import (fleet stays SDK-free) |
| `fleet/selectors.ts`, `fleet/fanout.ts` | Selector grammar (`dN`, `all`, glob, `label:k=v`, `project:name`) + prompt fan-out correlation |
| `src/state.ts` | **The entire client model**: one `createStore`; chat items, streaming, session mirror, `call()`, roster, stale-frame guards |
| `src/components/` | Thin components: read `state` reactively, mutate only via exported store actions. No data props |
| `src/tx/` | Typed client for the stats surface (`api` fetch helper + transcript/format utils); also co-locates `tx.css`, the transcripts-view stylesheet |
|`scripts/dev.ts`, `scripts/test.ts`|Dev runner, test wrapper|
|`scripts/build-omp-web.ts`, `scripts/test-onboard.ts`|Installable-bundle build (dist-bundle/cli.js, embedded-dist regenerate+restore) + offline distribution/onboarding E2E (Phase 5 gate)|
|`scripts/install.sh`|Curl-pipe one-liner installer (bun-only, adapted from oh-my-pi's): resolves the release tag (GitHub API), downloads + sha256-verifies the tarball against the release manifest, installs into the pinned dir + symlinks the bin. Test-only env overrides `OMP_WEB_INSTALLER_API`/`OMP_WEB_DOWNLOAD_BASE`/`OMP_WEB_INSTALL_DIR` let the offline E2E (test-onboard step 2b) exercise it against a local fixture|
|`scripts/install-omp-web.ts`|Pinned installer: `bun add <tarball>` into `<prefix>/install/` (default `~/.omp-web`; its own node_modules = exact `@oh-my-pi/*` pins) + bin symlink; NOT `bun install -g` (flat shared store inherits the omp CLI's SDK version → skew → runtime breakage; `--prefix`/`--bin-dir` for tests). The prefix holds the CLI CODE; the DATA home is chosen independently at first run|
| `scripts/bench-tests.ts` | Suite benchmark harness: `run`/`report`/`baseline`, JSONL history in gitignored `.bench/` |
| `test/` | Stats-suite tests (14 files) for the `fleet/stats/` API; gitignored `test/.fixture/` auto-regenerated idempotently by `scripts/gen-tx-fixture.ts` (api.test.ts `beforeAll`) |
| `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/position.md`, `docs/research/` | System architecture (wire contract, module map) + audit Phase 7 strategic items (findings #71–#80) + design-audit research (committed docs) |

## The wire contract (OMP_PROTO 2)

Transport is HTTP + SSE, no WebSockets on the agent-driving path:

- **Up**: `POST /command`, one `ClientCommand` per request, answered `202`; every command carries a client-supplied `id` (dedup window `COMMAND_DEDUP_WINDOW_MS` 60s / `COMMAND_DEDUP_CAP` 64). Answers ride the SSE stream as `call_result` frames.
- **Down**: `GET /events`, SSE, `event: frame`, `id: <seq>`, `data: <JSON ServerFrame>`. Priming (seqs 1..k): `hello_ok` → `attached` → `history` → `state` → `collab_status` → `available_commands` → `ready`. Then daemon-global delta seqs ≥ `SSE_DELTA_SEQ_START` (1024) via a byte-bounded `SseRing` (8 MiB / 10k entries), resumable via `Last-Event-ID`. Past `SSE_BACKPRESSURE_BYTES` (4 MiB) the stream is terminated in-band with a `stream_reset` frame (drop-and-resume; the daemon is ALIVE; do not treat the clean close as dormant).
- **Identity**: `hello_ok` is the FIRST event on every stream open (`proto`, `name`, `cwd`, `pid`, `version`, `sessionFile`). omp-session prints `OMP_SESSION|{...}` JSON contract lines on **stdout** (`event: listening` with bind/port/url, or `endpoint`); **all logs go to stderr**.
- **Priming on a bare omp-session**: `connect = attached` (every `/events` stream is attached to the single live session from open). The fleet edge **stamps** `sessionId = daemonId` on session-scoped frames and sends `attached` itself when proxying, so roster-mode clients can guard daemon switches.

Key constants (all in `shared/protocol.ts`): `OMP_PROTO = 2`, `SSE_KEEPALIVE_MS` 15s, `SSE_SILENCE_DEADLINE_MS` 30s, `SSE_RING_CAP` 10k, `SSE_RING_BYTES` 8 MiB, `SSE_DELTA_SEQ_START` 1024, `SSE_BACKPRESSURE_BYTES` 4 MiB.

## Invariants & conventions, read before editing

### Protocol (`shared/`)
- **Additive-only.** Adding a `WebMethodName`, `ClientCommand` variant, or `ServerFrame` variant is fine; changing or removing shapes is a **breaking change** → bump `OMP_PROTO` and coordinate the fleet connector + edge proto gates (`connector.ts` hello gate, `edge.ts` pipe gate) with it.
- History over the backpressure cap ships as byte-bounded sequential `history` frames (`final: false` … `final: true`); small transcripts are one frame with no `final`. Client accumulates until `final`.

### Server
- **stdout is reserved for `OMP_SESSION|` lines; logs to stderr.** Spawners parse stdout.
- POST `/command`: `202` accept; dedup re-accepts duplicates. `READ_ONLY` methods (12 rows in `methods.ts`) skip post-mutation broadcast; `HISTORY_RELOAD` methods (`newSession`/`switchSession`/`branch`/`fork`/`handoff`) resync chunked history **before** `call_result`. `NOT_READY_GATED` = prompt-family calls fail `not_ready` until the readiness gate clears.
- Auth (R14): loopback peers exempt; off-loopback requires bearer (`Authorization: Bearer` or `?token=`); wrong credential → 401. Binding a non-loopback host without `--token` is a **startup error**.
- `/download` is realpath-jailed to cwd + tmpdir + session-file dirs, the only file-egress path. `list_files` never escapes cwd.
- Idle auto-exit (default `--idle-timeout 30m`): no attached clients, no running agent/queue, no in-flight bash/eval, no open dialog, no live collab room. `0` disables. The `.jsonl` is durable; fleet marks the entry `asleep` and respawns with `--resume`.
- One live session per process (`BOOT_HANDLE "s1"`). Mux commands (`create_session` etc.) are rejected as unknown; multiplexing lives in omp-fleet.

### Fleet
- **Zero agent state.** Fleet persists only roster metadata (endpoints, per-spawn bearer tokens, `lastSessionFile`, `sessionTitle`/`sessionEmpty` probed from the lastSessionFile JSONL title slot + messageless-ness, git branch/dirty counts) and re-derives everything else by dialing daemons. While at least one browser is attached, the fleet edge retains a connector stream to each ready daemon, derives `{streaming, blocked}` per daemon from the tapped `state`/`ui_request`/`ui_request_end` frames, and broadcasts those as additive fleet-scoped `daemon_activity` frames (never persisted, never carry tokens/endpoints); a retained stream counts as an attached client, so a ready daemon's idle auto-exit is suspended while any browser is connected and resumes after the last browser disconnects (connector idle-drop), a deliberate, user-approved deviation from the old "never invent a fleet-side frame / idle-drop" invariant. The sidebar's activity dot derives `blocked`/`in progress` from the attached session's client state (attached row) or the edge's `daemon_activity` frames (detached rows; `remote` undefined when the edge predates the feature or a daemon's stream is down → idle); the yellow unreviewed dot is attached-only and view-gated (set when a turn ends while the transcript is scrolled away, cleared on re-pin / new turn / session switch; `chatPinned`/`answerUnviewed` in `src/state.ts`), the light-blue unread dot is marked when a detached daemon's streaming flips true→false (the `daemon_activity` frame) or the user switches away mid-stream and cleared on attach (the switch-away mark is the fallback for old edges/fleets that never send `daemon_activity`; `src/fleet-ui/unread.ts`). Git dirtiness NEVER folds into the dot (uncommitted changes are the row's diffstat chips, a separate display).
- **Per-worktree session dropdown.** Clicking a roster row opens a dropdown of the worktree's last-10 sessions (newest-first) instead of attaching directly; picking one resumes it. Listing rides a new fleet-edge command `list_daemon_sessions` → unicast `daemon_sessions` (`fleet/daemon-sessions.ts` lists from disk via the SDK's `SessionManager` with a LAZY import; the fleet stays SDK-free at static load, omp-check precedent; agent dir resolves from the fleet's env, matching production spawns). Resume: `spawn_resume` carries an optional `sessionFile` (edge validates membership against that worktree's listing before `--resume <file>`, never an arbitrary path) for asleep rows; ready rows attach then `switchSession`. A row whose last session file is missing or messageless renders a "New session" title (`sessionEmpty` probe).
- **Exclusive state locks.** Fleet state and session files are pidfile-locked for the owning process's lifetime, self-healing via pid liveness: a second fleet (or a second daemon resuming the same session file) refuses to start instead of clobbering state.
- **Tokens are minted fresh per spawn/restart and must NEVER be serialized** into roster frames or `/ctl/debug` (tests enforce this: `fleet/edge-wire.test.ts` asserts `toRosterEntry` output). Same for endpoints in `/ctl/debug` snapshots.
- `dN` ids are monotonic and never reused. Registry persists atomically (tmp+rename) on every mutation.
- `pN` project ids are monotonic and never reused; projects are realpath-keyed and deduped on registration (a duplicate realpath returns the existing project). Registering a project auto-registers its **default workspace** (`registerProjectMainEntry` in `fleet/worktrees.ts`): a roster entry for the main checkout mapped to the repo CWD (NEVER a managed worktree under `workspaceDir`), asleep and wakeable via `spawn_resume` unless `start` spawns it live. `removeProject` implicitly drops provably-empty placeholder entries (the never-started default workspace: spawned/asleep, no `lastSessionFile`, no endpoint) and refuses while any real roster entry references it, naming the blockers. Projects persist in the same atomic state file as the roster, and the `registered_projects` frame must NEVER serialize tokens/endpoints (same rule as roster frames; `fleet/edge-wire.test.ts` enforces it).
- Managed worktrees live under the `workspaceDir` knob (flag `--workspace-dir` > env `OMP_FLEET_WORKSPACE_DIR` > config-file `workspaceDir` key > `~/.omp-web/workspaces`; the root is created lazily on first worktree, never at boot). Deleting one requires ownership (realpath under `workspaceDir`) AND a clean tree: no `--force` in v1; the optional branch delete is `git branch -d` only, never `-D`. Session transcripts live under the agent dir, never inside the worktree, so worktree deletion never touches them.
- Status ladder is monotonic `connecting < session < resolving < ready`; `error` is terminal (only respawn refreshes). `hello_ok` gates: `OMP_PROTO` mismatch → terminal error; registered cwd vs `hello_ok.cwd` mismatch → `error cwd mismatch` (empty registered cwd → adopt hello's).
- Endpoint resolution order (spawn): last `{event:"endpoint"}` wrapper line › template `host` + listening port › `advertise` › loopback. 30s endpoint timeout → error + kill.
- Spawn templates: `{cwd}` `{token}` `{name}` `{labels}` `{resume}` substitution, `sh -c`, no shell escaping in `fillTemplate` (caller `shellQuote`s). `OMP_FLEET_LOCAL_TEMPLATE` replaces the `local` template command outright (dev runners). `DEFAULT_LOCAL_TEMPLATE` is `omp-web session --cwd {cwd} …`; installed-mode spawns hit the single entrypoint; dev overrides via env.
- Config default is `~/.omp-web/config.json` (`resolveConfigPath`: explicit path > `OMP_FLEET_CONFIG` > default). The file is read-only-loaded and shallow-merged (unknown keys tolerated, legacy configs keep loading); **`writeConfigFile` (`fleet/cli.ts`, the serve first-run offer) is the only writer**. `fleetFacts.configPath` is null when no file exists; that + empty roster = first-run. The default **state path lives next to the config** (`<config dir>/fleet-state.json`, `resolveStatePath`; explicit/`OMP_FLEET_STATE` win) so the first-run data-home choice moves config + state + workspaces together. Bare `omp-web` = fleet serve (`cli/omp-web.ts` injects `serve` for an empty argv); the TTY-only first-run offer (no config + stdin TTY) runs the omp-stack check (`fleet/omp-check.ts`, SDK probe via LAZY import so the fleet stays SDK-free: omp binary on PATH/`~/.bun/bin`, auth-usable providers via `getApiKeyForProvider`, default-role model from `settings.modelRoles.default`), prints status + the omp-standard config advice when missing, then ONE prompt (`Data home directory [~/.omp-web]: `, Enter = default, alternate path with `~/` expansion overrides, `n` declines) writes the config. The offer is TTY-only (non-interactive spawners that parse the banner never reach it), so its status lines, prompts, and confirmations print to **stdout** normally; only errors go to stderr.
- `GET /ctl/fs/browse?path=` (edge route; `fleet/fs-browse.ts`): directory picker backend, `~`/`~/` expanded server-side, realpath-canonicalized, subdirectories only, name-sorted, 500 cap, dot-dirs skipped in listings only, 400 on missing/not-a-dir/unreadable. Projects enter the fleet ONLY by explicit registration: no root scanning, no `roots` config key.
- Spawns that arrive with just a cwd (`/ctl/spawn`, the edge `spawn` command, sidebar "start a session" action) are stamped with the owning registered project's `projectId` via `projectIdForCwd` (`fleet/worktrees.ts`: main-checkout realpath match, else linked-worktree match) so the roster groups them under the project; unregistered paths stay untagged (fallback group).
- Remote entries are dial-in only; never probed with local git (branch/dirty counts are local-cwd-only).

### Frontend (`src/`)
- **One `createStore` in `src/state.ts` is the entire client model.** Components read `state` reactively and mutate only through exported actions. Don't introduce per-component state for shared data, and don't add a state library.
- **Markdown is ALWAYS `DOMPurify.sanitize(marked.parse(...))`** (`src/text/markdown.ts`): model output is untrusted raw HTML.
- Streaming: deltas buffer in `pendingDeltas`, flushed ≤60/s via `requestAnimationFrame`; **mutate live blocks in place** (`setState('live','blocks',i,'text',…)`), replacing block objects remounts `<For>` and kills the fade/scroll behavior.
- Stale-frame guards (in the `/events` onmessage handler, `src/state.ts`): drop session-scoped frames whose `sessionId !== currentSessionId` (`attach_result` exempt); dedup ring-replay via `seenFrameSeqs` per prime window; every attach/session-switch resets `nextId = 1` and rejects in-flight calls. `daemonRoster`/`daemons` survive session resets (fleet-scoped, not session-scoped).
- `sessionMode` (`'single' | 'roster'`) is set sticky by the `roster` frame; a proxied `attached` frame must never clobber it.
- The `registered_projects` frame carries `configPath` (string | null, additive; older edges omit it → client treats missing as null); `state.fleetConfigPath` is fleet-scoped like `daemonRoster`. First-run gate: `fleetConfigPath === null && registeredProjects.length === 0 && daemons.size === 0` → the roster's FirstRunPanel (welcome + add-project CTA + "just run `omp-web`" hint). Project groups show a hover "start a session" button (G4) that calls `spawnDaemon(project.path)` while no main-checkout daemon row exists (`worktreeOf === undefined`).
- Solid gotchas: use `untrack` when reading reactive objects inside effects you don't want to re-run (roster broadcasts replace daemon entries); `<Show when={…} keyed>` for object-identity-keyed rendering; `createRenderEffect` for imperative canvas (CharacterAvatar); module-level state survives row remounts where component signals don't (e.g. `activatingIds` in DaemonSidebar).
- localStorage keys: `omp.sidebarVisible`, `omp.notifyEnabled`, `omp.sidebarGroupsCollapsed`, `omp-web:theme`, `omp-web:font-size`, `omp-web:history`.
- Module layout: logic/data modules live in feature dirs, `src/sprites/` (pixel-art sprite engine + character data), `src/prompt/` (slash commands, autocomplete, prompt history, danger-confirm), `src/text/` (markdown, diff, clipboard, images), `src/usage/` (context thresholds, usage rows, model-options), `src/fleet-ui/` (dir-picker browse model, daemon uptime + fleet-debug parsing), `src/prefs/` (client theme + settings-panel display helpers), `src/chat/` (tool-run grouping). `src/store/` holds the per-domain action modules behind the `state.ts` facade; `src/components/` is presentational only.
- Styling: one global stylesheet split by domain, `src/styles/` holds `tokens.css` (design tokens + `:root[data-theme=…]` palettes), `base.css` (reset, `.icon`, global button/focus, pointer:coarse hit-targets, badge geometry), `app.css` (shell + status bar), `chat.css` (stream/markdown), `tools.css` (tool/bash renderers), `prompt.css` (composer/autocomplete), `modals.css` (dialogs/pickers/ask), `settings.css`, `fleet.css` (sidebar/roster/projects/debug), `usage.css` (meters/breakdown), plus `src/tx/tx.css` co-located with the transcripts view. `src/styles.css` is the `@import` entry; import order encodes the original cascade and is load-bearing: new files/rules go in a position that preserves it. Plain kebab-case feature-prefixed classes (`msg-*`, `tool-*`, `bash-*`, `settings-*`, `daemon-*`…), design tokens as CSS custom properties in `:root` (`--space-1..7`, `--r-*`, `--fs-*`, `--z-*`), theme palettes override only `--*` vars. No CSS modules, no inline styles except rare one-offs.
- Dev handle: `window.__ompState` (DEV only). No router; modals keyed off `state.modal === …`.

### Tests
- `bun:test` across two trees: **co-located** `*.test.ts` next to source (`src/state.test.ts` ↔ `src/state.ts`, etc., 58 files), plus the `test/` stats suite (14 files) covering the `fleet/stats/` API. Run through `bun scripts/test.ts`, which pins `--parallel` to the machine's **physical** core count (logical-count workers oversubscribe HT/hybrid boxes and thrash the daemon-spawning suites), `--timeout 15000`, `--retry 0`. Extra args forward to `bun test`.
- `test/` spawns no daemons: it drives `createStatsApp` in-process behind a real `Bun.serve` on an ephemeral port (`test/helpers.ts`), and its gitignored `test/.fixture/` is regenerated idempotently via `scripts/gen-tx-fixture.ts` (api.test.ts `beforeAll`).
- FS-touching tests MUST create scratch dirs via `tempDir()` from `shared/testkit.ts` (tracked, auto-removed by an `afterAll` hook), never raw `mkdtempSync`, which leaks dirs on repeated runs.
- Shared test helpers must be named `*.testkit.ts` (e.g. `fleet/server.testkit.ts`) so bun test discovery (`.test.`/`_test.`/`.spec.`/`_spec.`) never picks them up.
- **Heavy (spawn real daemons/processes)**: `server/omp-session.test.ts`, `server/collab-integration.test.ts`, `fleet/integration.test.ts` (real fleet + 3 real omp-session daemons, serial, hermetic `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` → no model → prompts fail with `ok:false` by design), `fleet/supervisor.test.ts` (fake `sh` children), `fleet/server-*.test.ts`, `fleet/edge-*.test.ts`. **Light/pure**: `src/**/*.test.ts` (state tested against a `FakeEventSource` + stubbed fetch), `shared/sse.test.ts`, `fleet/spawn-parse/selectors/events/daemons-aggregator/config/discovery/registry/fanout/connector.test.ts`, `server/settings-model/collab-relay/collab-host.test.ts`.
- Tests must not need a live model/API. Timers shrunk via connector opts / `OMP_SESSION_TEST_*` knobs. Suites must run from the repo root (`fleet/integration.test.ts` needs `server/index.ts`).
- `server/collab-relay.test.ts` deliberately never calls `server.stop()` (Bun hangs closing sockets with close codes, verified against bun 1.3.14); don't "fix" that.

### Style
- Tabs for indentation (enforced by oxfmt). `verbatimModuleSyntax` is on → `import type` discipline (no value imports of types).
- **Git identity comes ONLY from the user's `.gitconfig`.** NEVER set an identity yourself: no `git config user.name`/`user.email` writes (local or global), no `-c user.name=…`/`-c user.email=…` on commands, no `--author=`/`--committer=` overrides. If a commit fails with an unknown identity, stop and report. Never invent or guess one. (Reading the resolved identity with `git config user.name`/`user.email` is fine.)
- Typecheck with `tsgo` (`bun run check:types`); the `@typescript/native-preview` version is pinned exactly. NOTE: typescript-eslint/ESLint cannot run against TS 7. That's why linting is oxlint, not ESLint.
- Comments reference audit remediation findings as `finding #N` (numbering kept from the 2026-08 audit; the strategic items live in `docs/position.md`); keep the numbering when fixing/annotating.
- `dist/`, `node_modules/` are gitignored; `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/position.md`, `docs/research/` are committed docs: update, don't delete.
- Docs and markdown prose use no em dashes (AI tell): use periods or commas instead, never en-dash or hyphen stand-ins. En dashes inside numeric ranges (12–18px) are fine. Exception: CHANGELOG.md, whose bullets mirror commit subjects verbatim and must not drift from git history or the published release notes.

## Editing workflows

**Add a web-exposed method**: 1) add to `WebMethodName` in `shared/protocol.ts`; 2) row in `METHODS` (`server/methods.ts`), classify `READ_ONLY` / `NOT_READY_GATED` / `HISTORY_RELOAD`; 3) handler in `server/index.ts` (post-mutation broadcast unless READ_ONLY; resync-before-`call_result` for HISTORY_RELOAD); 4) `call()` from `src/state.ts` + UI; 5) tests.

**Add an SSE frame**: 1) variant in `SessionScopedFrame` or `ServerFrame` (additive); 2) emit site in `server/sse-delivery.ts` broadcast path; 3) client handling in `src/state.ts` (apply stale-frame guards if session-scoped); 4) tests.

**Breaking handshake/frame change**: bump `OMP_PROTO` in `shared/protocol.ts` AND update the proto gates in `fleet/connector.ts` (hello) and `fleet/edge.ts` (pipe) so old/new peers fail loudly instead of misparsing.

**Bug fix**: reproduce first (heavy suites give you the seams: hermetic fake daemons in `fleet/`, `FakeEventSource` in `src/state.test.ts`), then fix, then confirm the reproduction no longer triggers. Don't suppress warnings/errors to make tests green: the suite uses `--retry 0` and `--timeout 15000`; flaky-by-design is not acceptable.

## Verification

After any change: run the **targeted test file(s)** (`bun scripts/test.ts <file>`), then `bun run check:types`, then the full `bun run test` when the change touches shared/daemon/edge paths. UI changes: `bun run dev` (or `dev:single`) and verify in a browser against the actual surface: roster mode on :4713 with the fleet edge, standalone against the daemon. Readiness is observable: the daemon's `OMP_SESSION|` line, vite's `Local:` line, fleet's control API answering `/ctl/sessions`. Distribution/onboarding changes (cli/, bundle, first-run config): `bun scripts/test-onboard.ts`, the offline pack → sandboxed global install → config → bare serve → spawn → update round-trip gate.
