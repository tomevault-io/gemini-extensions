# OpenCode Game Studios

Indie game development managed through 49 coordinated OpenCode agents.
Each agent owns a specific domain, enforcing separation of concerns and quality.

## Technology Stack

- **Engine**: [CHOOSE: Godot 4 / Unity / Unreal Engine 5]
- **Language**: [CHOOSE: GDScript / C# / C++ / Blueprint]
- **Version Control**: Git with trunk-based development
- **Build System**: [SPECIFY after choosing engine]
- **Asset Pipeline**: [SPECIFY after choosing engine]

> **Note**: Engine-specialist agents exist for Godot, Unity, and Unreal with
> dedicated sub-specialists. Use the set matching your engine.

## Coordination Rules

1. **Vertical Delegation**: Leadership agents delegate to department leads, who
   delegate to specialists. Never skip a tier for complex decisions.
2. **Horizontal Consultation**: Agents at the same tier may consult each other
   but must not make binding decisions outside their domain.
3. **Conflict Resolution**: When two agents disagree, escalate to the shared
   parent. If no shared parent, escalate to `creative-director` for design
   conflicts or `technical-director` for technical conflicts.
4. **Change Propagation**: When a design change affects multiple domains, the
   `producer` agent coordinates the propagation.
5. **No Unilateral Cross-Domain Changes**: An agent must never modify files
   outside its designated directories without explicit delegation.

## Collaboration Protocol

**User-driven collaboration, not autonomous execution.**
Every task follows: **Question -> Options -> Decision -> Draft -> Approval**

- Agents MUST ask "May I write this to [filepath]?" before using Write/Edit tools
- Agents MUST show drafts or summaries before requesting approval
- Multi-file changes require explicit approval for the full changeset
- No commits without user instruction

## Coding Standards

- All game code must include doc comments on public APIs
- Every system must have a corresponding architecture decision record in `docs/architecture/`
- Gameplay values must be data-driven (external config), never hardcoded
- All public methods must be unit-testable (dependency injection over singletons)
- Commits must reference the relevant design document or task ID
- **Verification-driven development**: Write tests first when adding gameplay systems.
  For UI changes, verify with screenshots. Compare expected output to actual output
  before marking work complete. Every implementation should have a way to prove it works.

## Context Management

Context is the most critical resource in an OpenCode session. Manage it actively.

**The file is the memory, not the conversation.** Conversations are ephemeral and
will be compacted or lost. Files on disk persist across compactions and session crashes.

Maintain `production/session-state/active.md` as a living checkpoint. Update it
after each significant milestone:

- Design section approved and written to file
- Architecture decision made
- Implementation milestone reached
- Test results obtained

The state file should contain: current task, progress checklist, key decisions
made, files being worked on, and open questions.

## Workflow Modes

This project supports two workflow modes. Choose the one that fits your team size and project maturity:

### Hybrid Workflow (Recommended for Indie Teams)

- **Discovery Phase**: Rapid prototyping to find the fun. Low process overhead, minimal agents, throwaway code in `prototypes/`.
- **Production Phase**: Full OCGS discipline once the design is proven. Formal GDDs, ADRs, tests, and quality gates.
- **Best for**: Teams of 1–5, unknown designs, iterating to find the fun.
- **See**: `docs/hybrid-workflow.md` for full details.

### Full OCGS Workflow

- **All phases formal**: Every feature goes through design → architecture → stories → code → tests → review.
- **Best for**: Teams of 5–15, known designs, long timelines, publisher requirements.
- **See**: Full documentation in `docs/` and `.opencode/skills/`.

## Getting Started

Run `/start` in OpenCode to begin the guided onboarding flow.
Or jump directly to:
- `/brainstorm` — explore game ideas from scratch
- `/setup-engine godot 4.6` — configure your engine
- `/project-stage-detect` — analyze an existing project
- `/prototype` — rapid prototype a concept
- `/hybrid-prototype` — fast-lane prototype for discovery phase

## Available Commands

Type `/` in OpenCode to see all available commands. Key categories:

- **Onboarding**: `/start`, `/help`, `/project-stage-detect`, `/setup-engine`
- **Design**: `/brainstorm`, `/map-systems`, `/design-system`, `/quick-design`
- **Architecture**: `/create-architecture`, `/architecture-decision`, `/architecture-review`
- **Stories**: `/create-epics`, `/create-stories`, `/dev-story`, `/sprint-plan`
- **Reviews**: `/design-review`, `/code-review`, `/balance-check`, `/gate-check`
- **QA**: `/qa-plan`, `/smoke-check`, `/soak-test`, `/regression-suite`
- **Prototyping**: `/prototype`, `/hybrid-prototype`
- **Team**: `/team-combat`, `/team-narrative`, `/team-ui`, `/team-release`

## Studio Hierarchy

  release-manager      localization-lead

Tier 3 — Specialists (Subagents)
  gameplay-programmer  engine-programmer     ai-programmer
  network-programmer   tools-programmer      ui-programmer
  systems-designer     level-designer        economy-designer
  technical-artist     sound-designer        writer
  world-builder        ux-designer           prototyper

```

## Engine Specialists

- **Godot 4**: `godot-specialist` + `godot-gdscript-specialist`, `godot-shader-specialist`, `godot-gdextension-specialist`
- **Unity**: `unity-specialist` + `unity-dots-specialist`, `unity-shader-specialist`, `unity-addressables-specialist`, `unity-ui-specialist`
- **Unreal Engine 5**: `unreal-specialist` + `ue-blueprint-specialist`, `ue-gas-specialist`, `ue-replication-specialist`, `ue-umg-specialist`

## Notes

This is a port of [Claude Code Game Studios](https://github.com/Donchitos/Claude-Code-Game-Studios)
to OpenCode. The 72 skills are now in `.opencode/commands/`, the 49 agents are in
`.opencode/agents/`, and the 12 hooks are implemented as a TypeScript plugin in
`.opencode/plugins/ccgs-hooks.ts`.
