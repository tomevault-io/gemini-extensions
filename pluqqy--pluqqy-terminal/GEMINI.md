# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Pluqqy is a terminal-based tool for managing LLM prompt pipelines. It stores everything as plain text files (Markdown and YAML) and provides both a TUI and CLI for managing contexts, prompts, and rules that can be combined into reusable pipelines.

## Development Commands

### Building and Running
```bash
# Build the application
make build

# Build and run the TUI
make run

# Install to $GOBIN or $HOME/go/bin
make install

# Run tests
make test

# Format code
make fmt

# Run go vet for static analysis
make vet

# Update dependencies
make deps

# Build for all platforms (Darwin, Linux, Windows)
make build-all
```

### Testing Commands
```bash
# Run all tests with verbose output
go test -v ./...

# Run tests for a specific package
go test -v ./pkg/files/...
go test -v ./pkg/tui/...
go test -v ./pkg/composer/...

# Run tests with coverage
go test -cover ./...

# Generate coverage report
go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...
go tool cover -html=coverage.out
```

## Architecture and Code Structure

### Package Organization

The codebase follows a clean architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **cmd/** - Entry points and CLI command definitions
  - `cmd/pluqqy/main.go` - Main entry point with root command and TUI launcher
  - `cmd/commands/` - Individual CLI command implementations (set, list, show, etc.)

- **pkg/** - Core business logic and features
  - `pkg/files/` - File operations, YAML/Markdown handling, atomic writes
  - `pkg/models/` - Data structures (Pipeline, Component, Settings, Tags)
  - `pkg/tui/` - Terminal UI components using Bubble Tea framework
  - `pkg/composer/` - Pipeline composition and output generation
  - `pkg/search/unified/` - Search engine with query parsing and filtering
  - `pkg/utils/` - Utility functions (token counting, etc.)

- **internal/** - Internal utilities not exposed as public API
  - `internal/cli/` - CLI helpers, formatters, and validators

### Key Components

#### File Storage System (`pkg/files/`)
- All data stored as plain text files in `.pluqqy/` directory
- Components are Markdown files with optional YAML frontmatter for metadata
- Pipelines are YAML files defining component composition
- Atomic file writes using temp files and rename for data safety
- Path validation to prevent directory traversal attacks

#### TUI System (`pkg/tui/`)
- Built with Bubble Tea (Model-View-Update architecture)
- Main app states: List view, Pipeline builder, Component editor, Settings
- Enhanced editor with undo, file references, token counting
- OS-aware keyboard shortcuts (different bindings for Linux/Windows vs macOS)
- Component usage tracking and visualization (Mermaid diagrams)

#### Pipeline Composition (`pkg/composer/`)
- Reads pipeline definitions and resolves component references
- Handles both active and archived components
- Generates composed output with configurable section ordering
- Supports custom output filenames and paths via settings

#### Search Engine (`pkg/search/unified/`)
- Query parser supporting field-based searches (tag:, type:, content:, status:)
- Multi-filter support with AND/OR operations
- Searches across both pipelines and components
- Handles archived items with status:archived filter

### Data Models

#### Component
- Name, Path, Type (contexts/prompts/rules)
- Content (Markdown)
- Tags (string array)
- Modified timestamp

#### Pipeline
- Name, Description, Path
- Components (array of references)
- Tags (string array)
- Created/Updated timestamps

#### Settings
- Output configuration (filename, export path)
- Section formatting and ordering
- Stored in `.pluqqy/settings.yaml`

### Testing Approach

The codebase includes comprehensive test coverage:
- Unit tests for core logic (files, models, search)
- Component tests for TUI elements
- Test helpers in `pkg/tui/testhelpers/` for TUI testing
- Mock file systems for testing file operations

## Important Patterns and Conventions

### Error Handling
- Wrap errors with context using `fmt.Errorf` with `%w` verb
- Validate inputs early (path validation, file size checks)
- Return meaningful error messages for user-facing operations

### File Operations
- Always use atomic writes (temp file + rename) for data safety
- Validate paths to prevent directory traversal
- Check file sizes before reading (10MB limit)
- Handle both forward and backward compatibility for file formats

### TUI Development
- Follow Bubble Tea patterns (Model, Update, View)
- Keep state management separate from view rendering
- Use composition for complex components
- Implement proper cleanup in component lifecycles

### CLI Commands
- Use Cobra for command structure
- Support multiple output formats (text, JSON, YAML)
- Provide clear help text and examples
- Handle ambiguous names gracefully (e.g., same component name in different types)

## Key Features to Maintain

1. **Plain Text Storage** - Everything must remain as readable text files
2. **Atomic Operations** - File writes must be atomic to prevent corruption
3. **Backward Compatibility** - Support old file formats when reading
4. **Cross-Platform Support** - Handle OS-specific keyboard shortcuts and paths
5. **Search Capabilities** - Maintain powerful query syntax for finding items
6. **Archive System** - Preserve archive/restore functionality for components and pipelines

## Common Development Tasks

### Adding a New CLI Command
1. Create new command file in `cmd/commands/`
2. Define command with Cobra structure
3. Add to `main.go` command registration
4. Use `internal/cli` helpers for formatting and validation

### Adding a New TUI View
1. Create state struct with required fields
2. Implement Init(), Update(), and View() methods
3. Add keyboard handling in Update()
4. Create helper functions for complex operations
5. Add tests using testhelpers package

### Modifying File Formats
1. Maintain backward compatibility when reading
2. Update both read and write functions in `pkg/files/`
3. Update corresponding model in `pkg/models/`
4. Add migration logic if needed
5. Update tests to cover both old and new formats
