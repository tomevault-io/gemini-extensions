# Grafida — AI assistant orientation

Grafida is a cross-platform **desktop application** (macOS, Windows, Linux) for creating
and editing **Joomla! articles** through the Joomla Web Services (REST) API. It is built in
**PHP 8.4** with [**Boson**](https://bosonphp.com), uses **SQLite** for all local storage
(via **`joomla/database`**'s `SqliteDriver`, wired through a **`joomla/di`** container),
and **TinyMCE 8** as the HTML editor. Licensed **GNU GPL v3 or later**. Dev happens on macOS.

## Scope (what we deliberately do NOT support)

Grafida is an **offline article editor**: it composes article HTML locally and publishes it
through the REST API. It is **not** the Joomla back-end and does **not** reuse the Joomla
WYSIWYG editor environment. Consequently we do **not** support — and will not try to emulate —
**page builders** (SP Page Builder, JSN, Quix, etc.), **editor-button/editor-xtd plugins**
(e.g. the article/image/page-break/module-insert buttons, sliders, tabs, third-party
shortcode buttons), or **custom/alternative media managers**. Article bodies are plain HTML
authored in TinyMCE; images go through Grafida's own offline media picker (see `src/Media/`),
not a site-side media-manager plugin. Don't add features that depend on server-side editor
plugins or builder shortcodes.

## How Boson works here (important)

Boson runs a native webview and bundles a PHP runtime. There is **no `webview->bind` RPC**.
Instead `index.php` registers a handler for the `boson://` scheme; every request is turned
into a PSR-style `Boson\Component\Http\Request` and answered with a `Response`. The
front-end (a plain HTML/CSS/JS SPA under `assets/private`) talks to PHP by calling
`fetch('boson://app/api/...')`.

Request flow: `index.php` → `Grafida\FrontController` → `Grafida\Application\Kernel` →
either `Grafida\Http\ApiController` (paths under `/api/`) or a static asset / the SPA shell.
**The kernel is a pure `Request → Response` function**, so the whole back-end is testable
without opening a window (see `tests/Feature/ApiRoutingTest.php`).

**The composition root is a DI container, not the Kernel.** `index.php` builds a
`Grafida\Application\Container` (a thin `Joomla\DI\Container` subclass — see `src/Application/`)
via `ContainerFactory::create()` and pulls `FrontController` out of it; `Kernel` is now just
`(StaticProviderInterface $static, ApiController $api)`. Nothing is `new`ed ad-hoc and there is
no global/singleton database object — add a service by registering it in a **service provider**
(`src/Application/Provider/`), not by editing a constructor chain.

**File pickers must go through the native dialog, not `<input type="file">`.** Boson's
webview does not wire up the HTML file-input open-panel callback (WKWebView on macOS,
WebKitGTK on Linux), so an in-page `<input type="file">` `.click()` silently does nothing.
`index.php` therefore passes `$app->dialog` (Boson's `DialogApiInterface`) into the container
as the **`dialog` parameter**, from where it reaches `SettingsController`, and the SPA opens
files via `POST /api/dialog/open-file` (`api.openFile(filter)`, filter
`image`/`markdown`/`any`): `SettingsController::openFile()` calls `selectFile()`, reads the
chosen file and returns `{name, mime, dataBase64}` (or `{cancelled:true}`). `uploadLocalImage()`
(intro/full-text images, the in-editor/media-browser "Choose file…" button) and
`importMarkdown()` consume it. The dialog dependency is **nullable** so the kernel stays
window-free in tests (a null dialog makes the endpoint return 503).

## Layout

- `src/Application/` — the **composition root**. `Container` is a thin `Joomla\DI\Container`
  subclass whose only job is to give `get()` a generic return type (the parent's is `mixed`,
  which PHPStan level max cannot use). `ContainerFactory::create(array $parameters = [])`
  registers the parameters, then the five `Provider/` service providers (`StorageProvider`,
  `HttpProvider`, `SiteProvider`, `AiProvider`, `AppProvider`, `ControllerProvider`). The
  parameters are the app's only configuration seams — override them and you get a different
  app without touching a constructor:
  `db.path` (default `Paths::databaseFile()`; `':memory:'` in tests), `migrations.dir`,
  `base.path`, `docs.dir` (default `Resources::docsDir()` — note it does **not** go through
  `Resources::base()`, since the docs are read straight out of the phar rather than extracted),
  `static.provider`, `dialog` (nullable), and `secret.store` — which is
  **tri-state**: `null` → `SecretStoreFactory::secureStore()` (production), `false` → no store
  (forces the insecure-plaintext fallback path), a `SecretStore` instance → used as-is.
  The `DatabaseInterface` factory **connects *and* migrates**, so every consumer receives a
  migrated database. `Kernel` is `(StaticProviderInterface, ApiController)`.
  It also holds the two classes that make the **native event loop** affordable: `BosonApplication`
  (the `Boson\Application` `index.php` actually instantiates) and `EventLoopThrottle`.
  ⚠️ **Boson's event loop is a busy-wait and costs about half a CPU core with the app idle.**
  `Application::run()` calls `$poller->next()` forever; the stock poller separates two iterations by
  `usleep(1)` — one microsecond — and every third iteration crosses FFI into
  `saucer_application_run_once()`, a full native event-pump round trip. Measured with Grafida idle
  on the Articles screen: ~49% of a core in the PHP process, against 0.0% for the WebKit content
  process actually showing it. `EventLoopThrottle` is a `PollerInterface` **decorator** that adds a
  2 ms sleep after an idle iteration, taking that to ~1%. It is a decorator, not a replacement,
  because the poller the parent builds carries a deferred task that flips `Application::$isRunning`
  and fires `ApplicationStarted` — a closure over `private(set)`/private state a subclass cannot
  reach; wrapping also keeps us out of Boson's `@internal` microtask bookkeeping.
  ⚠️ **The throttle is a latency trade, so it must be woken.** A sleeping loop picks a `boson://`
  request up to 3 sleeps late, which is nothing once but is paid *per request* — so `index.php`
  calls `$app->wake()` after every request the front controller answers, and the loop runs
  unthrottled for 100 ms. A page's worth of API calls therefore runs at the upstream loop's full
  speed and only a genuinely quiet app is throttled. Anything else that learns the app is busy
  should wake it too.
- `src/Http/` — `HttpClient` (curl/stream transport to Joomla), `Json`, and the internal API.
  `ApiController` is only a **dispatcher**; a real `Router` route table resolves each handler's
  controller from the container on match, so a request builds one controller, not nine. The
  handlers live in `src/Http/Controller/`, each taking only the collaborators it uses; the shared
  site/article helpers live in the injected `Grafida\Http\SiteContext`, **not** a god base class.
  Controllers must never call each other — share through the injected services.
  (The hand-rolled `HttpClient` exists because `joomla/http` was, at the time, uninstallable on
  the PHP version in use — its laminas-diactoros dependency capped out below it.)
  ⚠️ **Detail is in `.claude/rules/internal-api.md`**, which loads when you touch `src/Http/`,
  `src/Application/` or `src/Debug/`. Two rules worth carrying without it: **a transport failure
  is not one error but two** (a connectivity failure must not be reported the same way as a TLS
  handshake failure — telling someone to check their internet over a bad certificate is actively
  misleading), and **nothing the internal API answers may be cached by the webview** (gh-35).
- `src/Joomla/ApiClient.php` — Joomla REST client: base-URL normalisation + probing, JSON:API.
  `probeApiBase()` remembers the first **connectivity** `HttpException` across the candidate bases
  and, when no candidate ever answers, rethrows it rather than reporting "no working API endpoint
  found" (gh-29) — offline must not be blamed on the URL. An auth failure (401/403 from a candidate
  that did answer) still takes priority over a transport failure on another candidate.
- `src/Secret/` — OS secret stores (macOS `security`, Linux `secret-tool`, Windows DPAPI) + factory.
  Windows DPAPI runs through **`WindowsDpapi`** (a direct FFI call into `crypt32.dll`), **not** a
  `powershell.exe` spawn — see the Windows build note below for why (the multi-second UI stall).
- `src/Site/` — site entity, repository, `SiteService` (token storage + connection test).
  `UnicodeAliases` is the per-site **tri-state** `auto`/`yes`/`no` behind the Sites form's "Site
  uses Unicode Aliases" (gh-61, `storage/migrations/10_sites_unicode_aliases.sql`); `normalise()`
  snaps NULL, `''` and anything unrecognised back to `auto`, which is what a pre-migration row and
  a form that omitted the field have to mean. It exists because reading Joomla's `unicodeslugs`
  needs `core.admin`, so "we could not read it" and "it is off" were the same answer — see
  `src/Reference/`.
  `FaviconService` (5s fetch) parses the site home page for `<link rel="icon">` / Apple
  touch icons, downloads the largest one (falling back to `/apple-touch-icon.png` then
  `/favicon.ico`), and caches the raw bytes in `site_favicons` (`FaviconRepository`).
  `sync()` is best-effort, run when a site is connected/updated (and on the manual metadata
  refresh); the cached icon is sent to the SPA as each site's `favicon` data: URI (in the
  `bootstrap`/sites payloads) and shown as a 64×64 rounded square on the Sites page and below
  the sidebar site dropdown. Under that sidebar favicon sits a **Visit site** button
  (`GRAFIDA_BTN_OPEN_SITE`, rendered by `renderSidebarFavicon()`) opening the site's `baseUrl` in
  the OS browser via `api.openUrl()`; like the favicon it only exists while a site is selected,
  and the collapsed icon rail hides it along with the whole `#site-selector`.
- `src/Reference/` — cached categories/tags/levels/fields + `EditorCssService` (5s fetch, rebase, cache).
  `reference_cache` is permanent server-side and stays **authoritative for rendering** — a screen
  always paints from the cache first — with three invalidation paths: the manual Refresh buttons, a
  configurable TTL driving a fire-and-forget background refresh, and an opt-in startup cache reset
  (**default off**, because an unconditional refetch at launch reads as a hang on a bad connection).
  ⚠️ **`unicodeSlugs()` answers from the site's own `UnicodeAliases` tri-state before it looks at
  anything else** (gh-61) — no request, and deliberately no cache write either, so switching back
  to `auto` re-reads the site rather than inheriting what the user asserted. Only `auto` reaches
  the API, and only for a token holding `core.admin`.
  ⚠️ **`EditorCssService::load()` is cache-first too, and nothing else ever looks.** Finding a
  template's `editor.css` costs template discovery (a styles-API call plus a home-page fetch) and
  then a walk over up to eight candidate URLs at 5s apiece — which used to be paid on *every*
  editor open, in front of the user. It now looks only when passed `$refresh`, which
  `SiteController::warmCaches()` does when a site is connected or edited, and `references(refresh:
  true)` does on a metadata refresh. **Everything the editor needs from a site is warmed there or
  it is warmed in front of someone trying to write.** A *miss* is cached as well (an empty string),
  so a template that ships no `editor.css` does not re-walk the candidates forever — but only when
  the site actually answered, since an unreachable site taught us nothing.
  ⚠️ **Detail is in `.claude/rules/joomla-api-and-references.md`**, which loads when you touch
  `src/Reference/`, `src/Joomla/`, `src/Publish/`, `src/Field/` or `src/Site/`. The rule most
  easily broken from outside: `TemplateDiscovery` needs the **template styles API**, not just a
  home-page scan — a child template that ships only an `editor.css` renders no asset URL of its
  own and is structurally invisible to any page scan (gh-3).
- `src/Field/` — `FieldSupport` (supported field-type subset + required-unsupported guard —
  `requiredUnsupported()` splits those fields into **`blocking`** (no value we could send: a dead
  end) and **`overridable`** (the draft carries the value imported from the site, so a confirmed
  "Publish anyway" can send it back), gh-59),
  `MediaFieldValue` and
  `FieldCategoryScope` (gh-56), which works out **which fields Joomla actually uses for a category** —
  assigned to it, to one of its ancestors, or to no category at all; `-1` ("Only Use In Subform")
  never. ⚠️ **The fields *list* endpoint does not carry the assignment and the API accepts no
  category filter** (`$fieldsToRenderList` omits `assigned_cat_ids`, and every API list model is
  built with `ignore_request` so `populateState()` never reads a `filter[…]`), so
  `ReferenceService::fetchFields()` pays **one item request per field** on a cache refresh to learn
  it. A field whose assignment is unknown stays in scope everywhere — hiding it would silently drop
  whatever the user typed into it. `annotate()` expands the assignment **downwards** into
  `categoryIds` (null = all) so the SPA re-scopes on a category change with an `includes()` test and
  the tree walk has exactly one implementation.
  **`media` is a supported type** — the one core field type Grafida can offer only because it has a
  media picker of its own (`openMediaBrowser()`, both tabs), so no site-side media manager is needed.
  ⚠️ **Its value is a record, not a path.** `plg_fields_media` renders the form field as
  **`accessiblemedia`**, a non-repeatable subform of `imagefile` / `alt_text` / `alt_empty`, and
  `#__fields_values.value` holds it as a JSON object string. `MediaFieldValue::decode()`/`encode()`
  is the only thing that should read or write it (mirrored in `app.js` by
  `decodeMediaFieldValue()`/`encodeMediaFieldValue()`); it understands all three shapes that reach
  us — the JSON string, an already-decoded object, and a **Joomla 3 bare path**, whose fallback
  `plg_fields_media::checkValue()` still carries. Two traps: **a write must carry the whole record**
  (`AccessiblemediaField::setup()` returns false for an object missing `imagefile` *or* `alt_text`,
  and `Form::filter()` drops a field whose setup failed — so a partial record is not a partial save
  but *no* save, and nothing errors), and an empty `imagefile` must collapse to the **empty string**,
  which is how `plg_system_fields` is told to clear the value. A picture picked offline is held as the
  same `grafida-media://N` sentinel the intro/full-text images use;
  `PublishService::resolveMediaField()` uploads it and rewrites the value the way Joomla's own media
  field does, `#joomlaImage://` fragment included — see `.claude/rules/media-and-publish.md`.
- `src/Article/` — `Draft` entity + repository (local drafts), the alias (URL slug) preview, the
  two-tab Articles screen (Local / Remote) and the portable **`.grafida`** export format. A draft
  remembers the `site_id` + `remote_id` it mirrors; drafts are only written to the DB on the first
  Save, so opening an unchanged remote article leaves no local draft behind.
  ⚠️ **Detail is in `.claude/rules/drafts-and-articles.md`**, which loads when you touch
  `src/Article/` or the draft/article controllers. Two traps worth carrying without it: **any new
  article attribute must first be checked against com_content's `article.xml` form** — a field
  absent from it is dropped *silently* on save; and the draft timestamps are naive UTC strings
  compared **as strings**, never via `Date.parse()`, which WKWebView mishandles for that form.
- `src/Debug/` — the recording substrate behind **Diagnose Connection** and the opt-in
  **Request Log** (gh-37): `RequestRecord` (one captured HTTP exchange), `Redactor`,
  `BodyFormatter`, `RecordingTransport`, `RequestLog`/`RequestLogService`, and the
  `RecordSink` interface both `ArraySink` and `RequestLog` itself implement. The log is an
  **in-memory ring buffer** (`RequestLog`, capacity 20) — not a table — because it is cleared
  at app start, on every site switch and whenever the setting is turned off, so nothing about
  it is meant to outlive the process; the on/off flag rides in the generic `settings` key/value store
  (`request_log`, **default off** — unlike `slash_tools`/`spell_check`, which default on)
  and needs no migration. Recording is a **`Transport` decorator** (`RecordingTransport`),
  not a change to `HttpClient`, which stays a dumb transport — this is what lets *Diagnose
  Connection* (`Grafida\Site\ConnectionDiagnostics`) work with the Request Log switched off:
  it builds a throwaway `ApiClient` over a `RecordingTransport` writing to a private
  `ArraySink`, never touching the shared log. `http.default`/`http.short`/`http.reference`
  (see `HttpProvider`) are wrapped into the container-shared `RequestLog`; **`http.ai` is
  not** (AI traffic is not "requests to the site", may be huge, and carries a different
  provider's key), and **`http.diagnostics` is also deliberately unwrapped** — a diagnose
  run records into its own `ArraySink`, so wrapping this transport too would double-record
  every probe into the shared log.
  ⚠️ **Redaction is unconditional.** `RequestRecord::toArray()` is the only serialisation
  path a record ever goes through — whether it is bound for the Request Log screen, the
  Diagnose Connection panel, or the JSON export — and it always masks `Authorization`/
  `X-Joomla-Token` (and any literal occurrence of the token elsewhere in a URL or body) down
  to first-4 + dots + last-4. There is no separate export-only redaction path to fall out of
  sync with the screen.
  Bodies are **capped at 64 KiB per direction at capture time** (`BodyFormatter::cap()`,
  applied by `RecordingTransport` before a record is even built — a media upload is a
  multi-megabyte base64 blob, and keeping 20 of those in memory is not acceptable) and
  described by kind — `none`/`text`/`json`/`binary`: JSON is pretty-printed, binary renders
  as the localised "(… binary data …)" marker, and an empty body is omitted rather than
  shown blank.
- `src/Media/` — offline image blobs (`media_blobs`) + `SiteImageFetcher`, the Media Manager
  screen (Site + Local tabs), the in-app crop/resize/rotate/flip image editor, and
  `MediaUploadTarget` — **where a publish uploads to** (gh-57), i.e. the per-site
  `media_adapter`/`media_folder` settings (`storage/migrations/09_sites_media_target.sql`, Sites
  form) and the automatic resolution behind them. It also owns the two statics `PublishService`
  used to keep privately — `safeName()` (the blob-id-prefixed upload name) and `publicPath()`
  (adapter path → site-relative URL) — because `predictedPublicPath()`, which answers
  `GET /api/media/{id}/target` for the editor's image URL field (gh-72), has to produce the *same*
  path the upload will, offline and without a request. ⚠️ **That answer is a prediction and the
  endpoint's `predicted` flag is load-bearing**: an unset adapter is only resolved by asking the
  site, and the file name is ultimately com_media's to choose. An already-uploaded blob answers
  from its recorded `remote_url` with `predicted: false` instead.
- `src/Publish/PublishService.php` — the publish pipeline (media upload, tags, fields, split, POST/PATCH).
  ⚠️ **Both are detailed in `.claude/rules/media-and-publish.md`**, which loads when you touch
  `src/Media/`, `src/Publish/` or `src/Html/`. They are one pipeline and are documented together.
  Three rules worth carrying without it: a pasted image is referenced by a **local URL the kernel
  serves** (`boson://app/api/media/{id}/raw?rev=…`), **not** an inlined `data:` URI (gh-36) — the
  latter is what froze the source editor on a couple of screenshots; `rewriteOfflineImages()`
  uploads **every** offline image on publish, tagged or not, so none leaks into the published HTML;
  and the upload path **names its adapter and is relative to that adapter's root**
  (`local-images:/grafida/<file>`, **not** `images/grafida/<file>`, which writes to `images/images/…`
  and yields a broken image) — leaving the adapter out is gh-57: Joomla then resolves the path
  against com_media's `file_path` parameter, `files` on a stock install, so every published image
  landed in the site's *files* folder.
  ⚠️ **`publish()` takes a `$force` flag and it is not a "skip the checks" switch** (gh-59): it
  makes the guard *send* the imported values of the required unsupported fields rather than refuse.
  Only the **required** ones are ever sent — an omitted `com_fields` key keeps the site's own value,
  because the API never fires `onContentNormaliseRequestData`, so leaving an optional one out is
  strictly safer than overwriting it with our snapshot.
- `src/Html/` — `ContentSplitter` (read-more split), `CssRebaser`, `InlineMedia`, `HtmlDocument`.
  ⚠️ **`HtmlDocument` is PHP 8.4's `\Dom\HTMLDocument` — a real WHATWG HTML5 parser (Lexbor) — and
  never `\DOMDocument`**, whose HTML support is libxml2's HTML4 parser with a custom, unspecified
  tree-construction algorithm. The difference is not cosmetic for article HTML: HTML4 leaves
  `<section>`/`<figure>` nested inside an open `<p>`, leaves stray content between `<table>` and
  `<tr>` where it stands instead of foster-parenting it out, implies no `<tbody>`, repairs misnested
  inline tags ad hoc rather than by the adoption agency algorithm, knows only the HTML4 entity
  table, and assumes ISO-8859-1 without a `<meta charset>` — each of which publishes a *different
  article* from the one the browser (and Joomla) shows. Two traps in the port: `\Dom\Element::
  getAttribute()` answers **null** for an absent attribute where `\DOMElement` answered the empty
  string (a silent behaviour change wherever the result was compared or `preg_*`'d), and the
  fragment is deliberately parsed inside a `<div id="grafida-root">` wrapper — not as a bare
  document, which would place a leading `<style>` or `<meta>` in the implied `<head>`, where the
  body serialiser would never see it again. ⚠️ **A stray `</div>` closes that wrapper**, leaving
  everything after it a sibling of it and so invisible to both the marker search and the serialiser
  — an article silently truncated at the stray tag, which unbalanced page-builder/Word markup
  produces routinely. `load()` therefore unwraps the wrapper whenever anything escaped it (the tell
  is the body having more than the one child we gave it) and falls back to the body itself. The libxml2-era `<?xml encoding="UTF-8">` prologue and
  `LIBXML_HTML_NOIMPLIED | LIBXML_HTML_NODEFDTD` flags are **gone**, not ported.
  ⚠️ **`tests/corpus/` is the round-trip contract and is language-neutral on purpose** — its format
  is documented in `.claude/rules/media-and-publish.md` and run by `ConformanceCorpusTest`. A
  failing case is a question about which behaviour is right, never a file to regenerate.
  ⚠️ **The read-more marker has two spellings and they are equals** (gh-71): Grafida's editor
  inserts `<hr class="readmore">`, but Joomla's own writes `<hr id="system-readmore">` — the only
  form `Table\Content::check()` splits on — so an article imported from a site carries whichever it
  was written with. `ContentSplitter` matches either token in either attribute; the SPA mirrors the
  set in `READMORE_SELECTOR` (styling + duplicate check), and `ArticleController::remoteArticleBody()`
  splits an incoming combined `text` on the marker before falling back to its `"\r\n \r\n"`
  heuristic. A marker we do not recognise is *invisible* in the editor and lost on publish.
- `src/Update/UpdateService.php` — the **update checker**. On startup the SPA calls
  `GET /api/update` (`api.checkUpdate()`) **fire-and-forget after the initial render**, so a slow
  fetch never blocks start-up. `UpdateService::status()` refreshes a per-user cache of the
  CDN-published update JSON (`https://cdn.akeeba.com/updates/grafida.json`, built by the
  `UpdateJson` release task: `{version,date,infoURL,download,releaseNotes}`) **at most once every 12
  hours** — the "last fetched" time is the cache file's mtime. The cache lives in the per-user
  **config** dir (`Paths::updatesFile()`/`configDir()` — Linux `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/grafida/updates.json`
  (falls back `~/.config`), macOS `~/Library/Application Support/Grafida/updates.json`, Windows
  `%APPDATA%\Grafida\updates.json`); note config ≠ data on Linux only. A failed fetch falls back to
  any existing cache, or writes an empty `{}` (so the 12-hour back-off applies to failures too and it
  does not refetch every launch). `status()` compares the cached `version` with `App::VERSION` via
  `version_compare` and returns `{available, version, infoURL, download}`. When available, the SPA
  (`renderUpdateNotice()`) shows a **bold green “New version available”** message
  (`GRAFIDA_MSG_UPDATE_AVAILABLE`) above the sidebar-footer version label, with a **Download** button
  (`GRAFIDA_BTN_DOWNLOAD`) that opens the release's `infoURL` (the GitHub release page) in the OS
  browser via `api.openUrl()`. The Kernel wires it with a short-timeout `HttpClient(5)`.
- `src/Display/DisplayModeService.php` — persists the interface display-mode preference
  (`auto`/`light`/`dark`) in `settings`; sent to the SPA as the `bootstrap` payload's
  `displayMode` key and written via `POST /api/settings/display-mode`. Because Boson's
  webview does **not** report `prefers-color-scheme` reliably (on macOS it always reports
  dark), `systemPrefersDark()` probes the OS appearance directly (macOS `defaults read -g
  AppleInterfaceStyle`, Windows `AppsUseLightTheme` registry DWORD, Linux gsettings
  `color-scheme`/`gtk-theme`) → `true`/`false`/`null` when undetectable; it is sent in the
  `bootstrap` payload as `systemPrefersDark` and re-probed on demand via
  `GET /api/settings/system-theme`. The SPA's `systemPrefersDark()` trusts that value to
  resolve `auto`, only falling back to the media query when it is `null`, and re-probes on
  window `focus` so `auto` follows OS theme changes at runtime; it sets
  `<html data-theme="light|dark">`;
  TinyMCE follows the app theme (skin `oxide`/`oxide-dark`); its editing surface switches to
  the dark built-in content CSS only when the site supplies no `editor.css`.
  The preference has **two** controls (gh-41): the Settings screen's select and a
  tri-state button group in the sidebar (`#theme-switch`, `fa-sun`/`fa-moon`/
  `fa-display`, above the nav and separated from it by a rule), so the theme can be
  changed without leaving an open article. Both go through
  `applyDisplayModeChange(mode, {silent})` and both are re-rendered by it, so they
  can never disagree; the sidebar one passes `silent` because its effect *is* the
  confirmation. Applying to an open editor needs nothing new — `applyTheme(true)`
  already re-creates TinyMCE from `getContent()`, so the article survives the switch.
  The buttons are `aria-pressed` toggles rather than a `role="radiogroup"` (which
  would oblige us to implement roving arrow-key focus for no gain), and they are
  **static markup** so `applyStrings()` localises their tooltips via the existing
  `data-i18n-title` pass — `renderThemeSwitch()` only flips `.active`/`aria-pressed`.
  `applyStrings()` also honours **`data-i18n-aria`** — aria-label only, for a
  container that needs an accessible name but must not sprout a hover tooltip.
- `src/Clipboard/` — `ClipboardService` reads the OS clipboard as plain text behind
  `GET /api/clipboard/text`: `pbpaste` (macOS), `wl-paste`/`xclip`/`xsel` (Linux, first one
  installed wins) and on Windows **`WindowsClipboard`**, a direct FFI read of `CF_UNICODETEXT`
  via user32/kernel32, with `powershell Get-Clipboard -Raw` only as the no-FFI fallback — the
  third instance of the pattern set by `Secret\WindowsDpapi` and `Display\WindowsThemeReader`,
  for the same reason: a PowerShell spawn costs about a second, the kernel is single-threaded, and
  this runs under a *keystroke*. ⚠️ Its `decodeUtf16LE()` is `public static` and FFI-free so the one
  fiddly part is testable off Windows — **the NUL terminator must be found on a code-unit boundary**,
  since scanning for a zero *byte* truncates at `U+0100` or mid-surrogate (an emoji).
  It backs the editor's **Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+V paste-as-plain-text** shortcut, and it exists because
  ⚠️ **`navigator.clipboard.readText()` is not usable on the webviews we ship**: WKWebView answers
  an unprivileged clipboard *read* with a system beep and a one-item "Paste" callout the user must
  click, turning a keystroke into a mouse trip. The clipboard is not a web resource in a desktop
  app, so it is read the same way as the OS appearance and the secret store — a short-lived
  subprocess, no prompt. Returns **null** for an unreadable clipboard but the **empty string** for
  an empty one, and the two must not be conflated (empty = paste nothing, unreadable = tell the
  user). Line endings are normalised to `\n`, because TinyMCE's plain-text conversion splits on it
  and a stray `\r` survives into the pasted paragraph. See the shortcut's own notes in
  `.claude/rules/spa-frontend.md` for which webview owns the chord and why that decides everything.
- `src/Editor/SlashToolsService.php` — persists whether the editor's slash-command menu is
  enabled (`settings` key `slash_tools`, **default on**), sent to the SPA as the `bootstrap`
  payload's `slashTools` key and written via `POST /api/settings/slash-tools`. Same shape as
  `DisplayModeService` (the `settings` table is a generic key/value store, so a new preference
  needs **no migration**); the boolean is encoded `'1'`/`'0'`. See the slash-commands note under
  `assets/private/` for the feature itself.
- `src/Editor/SpellCheckService.php` — persists whether the editor's native spell checking is
  enabled (`settings` key `spell_check`, **default on**), sent to the SPA as the `bootstrap`
  payload's `spellCheck` key and written via `POST /api/settings/spell-check`. Same shape as
  `SlashToolsService`. The stored value drives TinyMCE's `browser_spellcheck`, i.e. the editing
  body's `spellcheck` attribute — the **authoritative per-element gate**: WebKit will not check an
  element with `spellcheck="false"` even when its global continuous-checking flag is on, so this
  preference alone turns the underlining off on every platform. The macOS master flag
  ({@see MacSpellCheck}) stays **unconditionally enabled** at startup precisely so the attribute
  can toggle it live: `WebContinuousSpellCheckingEnabled` is read once and cached by WebKit, so
  forcing *it* false would need a restart to re-enable — the per-element attribute, which WebKit
  re-evaluates immediately, is what the toggle drives (`applySpellCheckChange()` also updates an
  open editor's body attribute so no re-init is needed). ⚠️ Turning it back **on** at runtime only
  marks text edited afterwards, not already-loaded content — an inherent WebKit quirk. See the
  spell-checking note under `assets/private/` (gh-24).
- `src/Editor/AutoCloseTagsService.php` — persists how the **source-code editor** closes HTML tags
  (`settings` key `auto_close_tags`, sent as `bootstrap`'s `autoCloseTags`, written via
  `POST /api/settings/auto-close-tags`). Same shape as `SlashToolsService` (generic key/value store,
  **no migration**), but the value is a **three-way choice**, not a boolean — `full` (default) /
  `closing` / `off` — because CodeMirror's `closetag` addon has two independent halves and they are
  genuinely useful separately (gh-52): `whenOpening` inserts `</p>` when you finish typing `<p>`,
  `whenClosing` completes a closing tag once you have typed its `</`. An on/off toggle would have
  had to make "off" mean "off, except the `</` completion", which no label can carry honestly.
  The SPA maps the three onto `true` / `{whenOpening: false}` / `false` in `autoCloseTagsOption()`;
  `AUTO_CLOSE_TAGS_CHOICES` in `app.js` must stay in step with `AutoCloseTagsService::AVAILABLE`,
  which snaps an unknown value back to `full`.
- `src/Text/` — **normalising AI-generated content**: `ContentNormaliser` strips the invisible
  characters LLMs and web pages leave in text (zero-width family, bidi controls and isolates, tag
  characters, variation selectors, soft hyphen, the `\p{Cf}` catch-all) and, in the default mode,
  collapses exotic spaces onto U+0020. Character tables follow "Layer A" of
  guillaumemeyer/watermarks-remover; **homoglyph folding is deliberately not implemented** (a Greek
  surname is not a watermark). `ContentNormalisationService` is the setting behind it — `full`
  (default) / `invisible` / `off`, generic `settings` key `content_normalisation`, **no migration**,
  sent as `bootstrap`'s `contentNormalisation`, written via `POST /api/settings/content-normalisation`;
  `AVAILABLE` is mirrored by `CONTENT_NORMALISATION_CHOICES` in `app.js`. It is three-way rather than
  a toggle because the space half is not as safe as the invisible half: a no-break space is French
  punctuation and U+3000 is ordinary Japanese.
  ⚠️ **Some invisible characters are load-bearing and the decision is contextual**: ZWJ/VS16 after an
  emoji base build 👨‍👩‍👧 and ❤️‍🔥, tag characters after an emoji base spell a subdivision flag, ZWNJ/ZWJ
  after a letter are Persian/Arabic/Indic orthography, and U+0600–0605 & co. are Arabic number signs.
  A joiner is judged against **the last character kept**, never the last character *seen* — a stripped
  character must not lend its meaning to the next one.
  ⚠️ **There is exactly one implementation and it is in PHP.** It is applied where text crosses a
  boundary — `AiRenderer::render()` (AI replies, and so Insert), `SettingsController::convertMarkdown()`
  (imported Markdown), `SettingsController::clipboardText()` (paste as plain text) and
  `PublishService::publish()` (title/body/metadata, the guarantee point). Do not mirror the tables into
  JavaScript to catch an ordinary Cmd+V: the publish sweep already covers it, and two tables would
  drift. It works on **code points**, so an entity spelling (`&#8203;`) survives, and it is applied to
  HTML as a flat string — none of the characters it touches can occur in HTML syntax, and a string
  pass cannot reformat the markup the way a parse/serialise round trip would.
- `src/Help/HelpService.php` — the **in-app documentation** (gh-55). `docs/` is a **single source
  with two consumers**: the sidebar's **Help** screen and the project's **GitHub wiki**, which
  `scripts/sync-wiki.sh` (`phing wiki` / `composer docs:wiki`, and step 4 of `phing release`)
  publishes to. The wiki is the dumber consumer, so **it dictates the source format** — one flat
  directory of `.md` files whose names are the wiki page names, **no YAML front matter** (a wiki
  renders it as visible junk), and inter-page links written as bare relative page names. The table
  of contents is `docs/_manifest.json`, a **tree** (`{slug?, title, children?}`, max depth 4; a
  node with no `slug` is a heading). It is not a convenience: `glob()` does not work on `phar://`,
  so a manifest-driven index is what lets `Resources::docsDir()` read the docs straight out of the
  compiled binary with no extraction step. Endpoints `GET /api/help`, `/api/help/page/{key}`,
  `/api/help/image/{file}`; none of them touches a site, the network or the database, so the Help
  screen works with nothing configured at all.
  ⚠️ **Detail is in `.claude/rules/documentation.md`**, which loads when you touch `docs/`,
  `src/Help/` or `scripts/sync-wiki.sh`. Two rules worth carrying without it: **no link in a
  documentation page may be followed normally** — Boson's webview opens no new window and a
  same-window navigation would replace the SPA with no way back, so an external URL leaves through
  `api.openUrl()` and anything unclassified has its click swallowed (`mailto:` is deliberately
  *not* tagged external, because `UrlOpener` accepts http(s) only and would answer with an error
  toast); and **the manifest nests but the files do not** — a wiki has a flat page namespace, so
  the hierarchy lives in the manifest and never as subdirectories.
- `src/Markdown/`, `src/I18n/` — Markdown import; language service. `I18n\UiStrings::KEYS` is the
  canonical list of UI string keys shipped to the SPA (used by `BootstrapController` and
  `SettingsController`) — so a key the SPA never reads (`GRAFIDA_MSG_VERSION_NOTE`, resolved
  server-side in `PublishService`) belongs in `en-GB.ini` but **not** in `KEYS`, or it is shipped
  to a front-end with no use for it. `LanguageService::translateIn($key, $tag)` translates into a
  **named** language instead of the interface one, for the few strings whose reader is not the
  person at the keyboard; an unshipped tag (including Joomla's `*` / All) falls back to
  `translate()`, i.e. interface language → en-GB → the key. It caches one catalogue per tag.
- `src/Storage/` — SQLite + migrations, on **`joomla/database`**. There is **no global DB object**:
  the container owns the single `Joomla\Database\DatabaseInterface` instance. `SqliteDatabase`
  extends `Joomla\Database\Sqlite\SqliteDriver` and overrides `connect()` to apply the pragmas the
  app depends on (`journal_mode = WAL`, `foreign_keys = ON` — the AI-chat cascade deletes need it —
  and `busy_timeout = 5000`); `DatabaseFactory` builds one from a path.
  `Migrator` applies `storage/migrations/*.sql` in lexicographic order, exactly once each, tracked
  by file name in `schema_migrations`. **Its bookkeeping runs through the driver but each migration
  file's body is still handed to the raw `\PDO::exec()`** (via `getConnection()`) — deliberately: the
  `.sql` files hold multiple statements *and* `--` comments, which a prepared statement cannot run
  and `DatabaseDriver::splitSql()` (a naive `;` splitter that does not strip comments) would mangle.
  `04_ai_chat_response_chain.sql` is two bare `ALTER TABLE … ADD COLUMN`s and is **not** re-runnable,
  which is what makes the `schema_migrations` bookkeeping load-bearing — and why
  `StorageService::reset()` wipes every table *except* that one.
  `StorageService` reports the DB file path, opens its folder in the OS file browser
  (`open`/`explorer`/`xdg-open`), and resets local storage (deletes secrets + wipes all
  tables, keeping `schema_migrations`). Exposed under `/api/settings/storage[/open|/reset]`.
  ⚠️ `PRAGMA foreign_keys` is a **no-op inside a transaction**, so `reset()` must never be wrapped
  in one.
  ⚠️ **Every kind of OS-stored secret needs its own delete loop in `reset()`, run *before* the bulk
  wipe.** The secret store is not a table, so `DELETE FROM` reaches none of it, and once the row
  carrying the `secret_ref` is gone nothing can say which keychain entry was ours — it becomes an
  unfindable orphan. `reset()` therefore loops `SiteService::delete()` **and**
  `AiServiceManager::delete()` (the latter was missing until it was reported through the
  documentation). A future secret gets a third loop; `StorageServiceTest` pins this.
- `src/Ai/` — the **AI chat assistant** (chat with an LLM about the open article, the document
  supplied as context; modelled on the Joomla AITiny plugin, **text only — no AI images**).
  `AiServiceManager` is CRUD over configured **AI services** (`ai_services`), each a named
  provider connection (provider + endpoint + model + params); the API key lives in the OS keychain
  (reference `grafida.ai_service.{id}`, insecure-plaintext fallback like sites). **Multiple services
  are supported**; one may be flagged default, else the **lowest id** wins (`default()`). `Defaults`
  loads bundled `resources/{defaults.json,voices.json,providers.json}` (ported from AITiny: the base
  **system prompt**, the writing **tools** generate/proofread/friendly/professional/concise, the
  tone-of-voice library, and the **provider table** — OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, DeepSeek, Google,
  Groq, MiniMax, Mistral, OpenRouter, Perplexity, Scaleway, GitHub, Custom (OpenAI Completions API),
  Custom (OpenAI Responses API) — each with endpoint/auth/chat-path/models-path/`sse_dialect`). The dialect
  is **never persisted**: `ai_services` stores only the provider *key*, and chat-path/auth/models-path/
  dialect are derived from `providers.json` at runtime, so changing the table needs no DB migration.
  `effectiveTools()` overlays the code defaults with `ai_tools` DB overrides
  + custom tools; **each tool may target its own service** (`service_id`).
  ⚠️ **An override row is written whole, but a PATCH may carry any subset of the fields** (gh-28), so
  `AiServiceController::updateAiTool()` fills what the body omits from `effectiveTool($key)` — the
  tool *as it currently resolves*, bundled defaults included — never from the override row alone.
  Falling back to the row alone is what let the list's enable/disable toggle (which sends nothing but
  `enabled`) blank a bundled tool's title, icon, prompt and tone the first time it was pressed; and
  `isCustom` is likewise preserved from the existing row, since a custom tool demoted to a built-in
  override matches no bundled key and disappears from the list entirely. That damage went unnoticed
  because `effectiveTools()` used to **ignore** an override's `title`/`icon`/`override_system` — which
  was the reported bug: a saved icon never took effect. Those three are authoritative now, so a
  pre-0.3 toggle-written row (recognised by `Defaults::isToggleOnlyRow()`: a title equal to the tool
  key, or empty — never something the edit form sends) contributes **only** its `enabled` flag.
  `AiChatRepository` persists
  **saved chats** (`ai_chats` + `ai_chat_messages`) linked to a draft; deleting the draft cascades
  them away. `ai_chats` also carries the Responses-API conversation chain
  (`previous_response_id` + `last_response_at`, the latter **ISO-8601 UTC** — unlike the other
  timestamp columns — because the SPA compares it against `Date.now()` and WKWebView's `Date.parse()`
  does not reliably handle the naive `gmdate('Y-m-d H:i:s')` form); see the AI facts below.
  Transport is deliberately **inverted vs. AITiny — see the AI transport facts below**.
  Endpoints: `/api/ai/services[...]` (+ `/default`, `/resolved`), `/api/ai/tools[...]`,
  `/api/ai/system-prompt`, `/api/ai/proxy`, `/api/ai/render` (sanitise a reply for display — see the
  AI facts), `/api/ai/chats[...]`, `/api/drafts/{id}/chats`.
- `src/Support/` — `Resources`/`Paths` (filesystem locations), `App` (app identity/legal
  metadata: name, `VERSION`, copyright, licence + FSF URL, the verbatim Joomla! trademark
  disclaimer — sent to the SPA in the `bootstrap` payload's `app` key), and `UrlOpener`
  (opens an external http(s) URL in the OS default browser; backs `POST /api/open-url`).
  The sidebar footer shows the version and opens an About dialog using this metadata.
  `App` also holds **`MIN_MACOS`** (+ `MIN_MACOS_NAME`), the single source of truth for the
  minimum macOS version — see `src/Startup/` below.
- `src/Startup/` — the two things that run **before the Boson application exists**, and therefore
  before the webview, the container, the database and the SPA: `StartupCheck` (is this OS able to
  load the webview library at all?) and `FailureReporter` (say why we are dying). Wired straight
  into `index.php`: the pre-flight sits right after the autoloader, and `new Application(...)` — the
  single call that dlopens the native library, checks its ABI and creates the window — is the
  **only** thing inside the `try`, so an application bug further down keeps its ordinary stack
  trace. Both exit `StartupCheck::EXIT_UNSUPPORTED` (69, `EX_UNAVAILABLE`).
  ⚠️ Three rules that are not guessable from the code. **Nothing here can be translated** — it runs
  before `UiStrings`, so the text is hard-coded English, like `App::JOOMLA_DISCLAIMER`; **the checks
  fail open** (an undetectable or unparseable OS version lets the launch proceed, because refusing
  to start on a machine we merely could not identify is worse than the crash we are preventing, and
  the `catch` explains it a moment later anyway); and **stderr is not a user-facing channel** — a
  macOS `.app` sends it to unified logging and `index.php` has already hidden the Windows console —
  so the message also goes to a native alert (`osascript`, `MessageBoxA`, `zenity`/`kdialog`), with
  the stack trace kept to stderr. `App::MIN_MACOS` is dictated by the prebuilt Boson library we
  vendor, not by our own code; the coupling and its regression guard are in
  `.claude/rules/build-and-packaging.md` (gh-58).
- `assets/private/` — SPA (`view/index.html`, `css/`, `js/`, `js/tinymce/`).
  ⚠️ **The front-end notes live in `.claude/rules/spa-frontend.md`**, which loads automatically
  whenever you work under `assets/private/`. Everything about the TinyMCE 8 wiring (including the
  mandatory `license_key: 'gpl'`, without which the editor silently starts **read-only**), the
  npm-vendored and **gitignored** front-end libraries, CodeMirror source editing, the
  slash-command menu, spell checking, editor colour-scheme resolution, the Styles drop-down, the
  media browser and the collapsible layout is in there. Read it before changing anything in the
  SPA. It is deliberately **not** at `assets/private/CLAUDE.md`, because `boson.json` bundles
  `assets/private` wholesale into every shipped binary.
- `language/<tag>/<tag>.ini` — translations, one file per language (e.g. `language/de-DE/de-DE.ini`).
  (There is **no** Joomla `.sys.ini` or `language/grafida.xml` manifest, and the files are **not**
  named `<tag>.com_grafida.ini` — Grafida is a desktop app, not a Joomla component. `LanguageService`
  loads each catalogue with joomla/language's empty-extension "internal" naming, i.e. a bare `<tag>.ini`.)
  The shipped-language list is **not** hard-coded: `LanguageService::available()` discovers it at
  runtime by scanning `language/` for every `<tag>/<tag>.ini` and reading that file's
  `GRAFIDA_LANGUAGE_ENDONYM` key (the language's name in its own tongue) for the label; the default
  (en-GB) sorts first, the rest by endonym. So every `.ini` MUST carry `GRAFIDA_LANGUAGE_ENDONYM`,
  and adding a translation needs no code change (the list is sent to the SPA as `bootstrap`'s
  `availableLanguages` tag => endonym map).
- `docs/` — the user documentation, in Markdown. Shipped inside every binary (it is in
  `boson.json`'s `build.directories`) **and** published as the GitHub wiki; see `src/Help/` above.
- `storage/migrations/*.sql` — schema. `.plans/` — implementation step notes (gitignored).
- `build/glossaries/` — per-language translation glossaries.
- `build/icon/` — application icon. `grafida.svg` is the **single master** (clipart pencil
  drawing a capital “J”); `scripts/make-icons.sh` rasterises it into `Grafida.icns` (macOS),
  `Grafida.ico` (Windows), a `png/` set + `grafida.png` (Linux), all committed. Wiring:
  `make-macos-app.sh` copies the `.icns` into the bundle + `Info.plist` (`CFBundleIconFile`);
  the Windows installer bundles the `.ico` beside `grafida.exe`; Linux ships `grafida.desktop`
  + a hicolor PNG. `build/` is otherwise gitignored — the whitelisted exceptions are
  `build/icon/`, `build/glossaries/`, `build/composer/` (the npm-vendoring install script), and the
  two packaging sources `build/linux-install.sh` + `build/windows-installer.nsi` (see
  `build/.gitignore`). Re-run make-icons after editing the SVG.

## Build & packaging (one step)

`composer build` → `scripts/build-all.sh` is the one-shot compile-and-package pipeline (every
target in `boson.json`, then per-platform packaging into `build/dist/`). `phing` /
`composer build:git` compiles the binaries only; `phing release` does the full GitHub + CDN
release. The **CHANGELOG is the single source of truth for the version** — `build/tasks/set-version.php`
stamps its topmost heading into `App::VERSION` before every compile. `node`+`npm` are build
prerequisites (the front-end libraries are vendored by `composer run-script vendor:assets`).

⚠️ **The full build, code-signing and release detail lives in `.claude/rules/build-and-packaging.md`**,
which loads automatically when you touch `build/`, `scripts/`, `build.xml`, `boson.json`,
`composer.json`, the CHANGELOG or the release notes. The one rule to carry around without it:
signing on **both** macOS and Windows depends on the patched `sibling-phar` SFX and on
**splitting** the compiled binary into a clean stub + a sibling PHAR — signing a *combined*
binary appends the certificate past the PHAR, corrupts its signature, and the app dies at startup.

## Key Joomla API facts (verified against Joomla 5.4 source)

⚠️ **These live in `.claude/rules/joomla-api-and-references.md`**, alongside the reference-cache
notes they govern; it loads when you touch `src/Joomla/`, `src/Reference/`, `src/Publish/`,
`src/Field/` or `src/Site/`.

The two that cause silent, hard-to-diagnose damage, so they stay here: **write bodies are a flat
top-level JSON object** — Joomla's `{data:{type,attributes}}` JSON:API envelope is for *responses
only*, and wrapping a write makes Joomla bind nothing and return the unchanged resource. And send
the body as the discrete **`introtext` / `fulltext`** columns, **never** the combined `articletext`
field: on a PATCH the controller backfills every column you omit from the existing record, then
`Content::bind()` overwrites what it derived from `articletext` with those backfilled OLD values —
so a PATCH sending only `articletext` **silently reverts the body**. A create has no backfill,
which is why it appears to work.

Also remember a token-bearing user is **not necessarily a Super User**: admin-only routes may 403,
so callers must degrade rather than throw.

## Key AI assistant facts

⚠️ **These live in `.claude/rules/ai-assistant.md`**, which loads automatically when you work
under `src/Ai/`, `assets/private/js/ai/` or the AI controllers.

Two things to carry around without it. **Transport is inverted vs. AITiny (JS-primary, not
PHP-primary):** the `boson://` kernel cannot stream, so the provider call runs in the SPA's
JavaScript, which streams the SSE response token-by-token; PHP stays the source of truth for
services, prompts/tools and saved chats. **Do not "fix" the API key being handed to local JS by
moving the call back to PHP — that kills streaming**; it is a deliberate desktop-only trade-off.
And the assistant is **text only — no AI images**.

The rules file covers the three SSE dialects and where they branch, Responses-API conversation
chaining, the CORS/ATS traps behind "the interface freezes" with a local model, the multimodal
opt-in and image-collection paths, and the panel UI including the server-side sanitising renderer.

## Conventions

- Every PHP file starts with the GPLv3 copyright docblock. `declare(strict_types=1)`.
- `composer test` runs the suite; `composer linter:check` runs PHPStan (level max + strict rules).
- Add new UI strings to `language/en-GB/en-GB.ini` (canonical) and the `KEYS`
  list in `Grafida\I18n\UiStrings`, then translate. **See the translation flow below.**
- **Never `new` a service — register it in a provider** (`src/Application/Provider/`) and let the
  container inject it. There is no global database object and no singleton to reach for.
- **Adding an endpoint** = a handler method on the right `src/Http/Controller/` class + one line in
  that controller's `registerRoutes()`. Nothing else changes — no constructor chain to thread.
- **Data access goes through `Joomla\Database\DatabaseInterface`, query-builder-first**
  (`$db->createQuery()->select(…)->from($db->quoteName(…))->where(… . ' = :id')->bind(':id', $id, ParameterType::INTEGER)`).
  Drop to raw `setQuery('…')` + `bind()` only where the builder has no vocabulary: the `ON CONFLICT`
  upserts, `PRAGMA`s, and the `sqlite_master` introspection query. Three traps, all of which have
  already bitten this codebase:
  - **`bind()` takes its value BY REFERENCE.** Bind from a variable (or an array *element*), never
    from an expression or literal — and the variable must still hold the right value at
    `execute()` time, not just at `bind()` time.
  - **`$query->insert()->set()` emits MySQL-only syntax** (`INSERT INTO t SET a = …`), which SQLite
    rejects. Always use `insert()->columns([…])->values('…')`.
  - **`loadAssoc()`/`loadResult()` return `null`** on no rows, not PDO's `false`.
  Upserts use SQLite's `ON CONFLICT(key) DO UPDATE SET col = excluded.col` so no placeholder is ever
  bound twice (native prepares reject a re-used named parameter with "column index out of range").
- Tests build the app from the container: `tests/Support/TestContainer::create()` gives a fully-wired
  app on an in-memory, already-migrated database (it takes the `secret.store` tri-state and an
  optional dialog stub); `TestDatabase::memory()` gives a bare `DatabaseInterface` for repository
  unit tests. The **Feature suite is the API contract** — it drives `Kernel::handle()` over every
  route and asserts status + JSON shape. Do not edit an assertion to make a refactor pass.
- ⚠️ `composer phpcs:check` currently fails on **every** `src/` file, including at pristine `HEAD` —
  the installed php-cs-fixer disagrees with the committed formatting. It is **not** a usable gate;
  match the surrounding style by eye and rely on `linter:check` + `test`.
- Never build a localised sentence by concatenating fragments around an injected value — word
  order differs per language. Keep each message a single string with `%s` placeholders and
  interpolate in the SPA with `formatNodes(t('KEY'), node)` (returns text/DOM nodes to spread
  into `el()`), mirroring Joomla's `Text::sprintf()`. `formatText()` is the plain-string
  counterpart (toasts); **`formatNodesStrong()` emphasises the template's own literal text**
  instead of the substitution, which is how a `<strong>Created:</strong> 20 Jul 2026` pair is
  rendered from one string rather than from a label key plus a value key — the label, its
  punctuation and its position relative to the value all stay the translator's to decide. All
  three share `interpolateNodes()`.
- **Commit directly on `main`. Do NOT create or switch to feature branches unless explicitly
  asked.** This project is worked solo and the branch overhead is unwanted; this deliberately
  overrides the general "branch first if on the default branch" default. If a branch was created
  by default tooling behaviour, fast-forward merge it into `main` and check `main` back out.
- **Every change adds its CHANGELOG entry**, terse and placed in its significance group
  (`!` `+` `-` `~` `# [HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW]`) rather than appended — the format is documented under
  "CHANGELOG style" in `.claude/rules/build-and-packaging.md`. The CHANGELOG is also the single
  source of truth for the version number.
- **Keep the checked-in documentation current in the same change.** That is *two* things: this
  root `CLAUDE.md` and the path-scoped files under `.claude/rules/` (see the map below). The rules
  files are the easier ones to forget precisely because they are not always in context — but a
  change to the SPA, the AI assistant, media/publishing, drafts, the reference cache, the internal
  API or the build system is almost always made in a session where the matching rules file *was*
  loaded, so update it there and then. If nothing documented changed, leave it alone.

### Where the rest of the documentation lives

`CLAUDE.md` is always in context; each `.claude/rules/*.md` file loads automatically only when you
touch the paths it declares in its `paths:` frontmatter. Each root pointer above keeps its area's
safety-critical prohibition resident, so those never depend on a rules file being loaded.

| File | Loads when you touch |
|---|---|
| `.claude/rules/spa-frontend.md` | `assets/private/**` |
| `.claude/rules/ai-assistant.md` | `src/Ai/**`, `assets/private/js/ai/**`, the AI controllers |
| `.claude/rules/media-and-publish.md` | `src/Media/**`, `src/Publish/**`, `src/Html/**` |
| `.claude/rules/drafts-and-articles.md` | `src/Article/**`, the draft/article controllers |
| `.claude/rules/joomla-api-and-references.md` | `src/Reference/**`, `src/Joomla/**`, `src/Publish/**`, `src/Field/**`, `src/Site/**` |
| `.claude/rules/internal-api.md` | `src/Http/**`, `src/Application/**`, `src/Debug/**` |
| `.claude/rules/documentation.md` | `docs/**`, `src/Help/**`, `scripts/sync-wiki.sh` |
| `.claude/rules/build-and-packaging.md` | `build/**`, `scripts/**`, `build.xml`, `boson.json`, `composer.json`, CHANGELOG, RELEASENOTES.md |

⚠️ A new rules file's `paths:` must actually cover the code it describes, or it will silently
never load. Deep build/signing recipes live in `build/readme/01`–`04`.

## Translation flow (must be followed every time)

The canonical source is **en-GB**. Translations use the **Joomla INI** format. Before each
translation run, consult the per-language glossary in `build/glossaries/<tag>.md` (create it
if missing) and update it with any new terms — glossaries keep terminology consistent. A new
language needs only its `<tag>/<tag>.ini` file (e.g. `language/de-DE/de-DE.ini`) — there is no
`.sys.ini` and no manifest to register it in (`LanguageService` discovers languages by scanning
the directory at runtime). Each `<tag>.ini` MUST include a `GRAFIDA_LANGUAGE_ENDONYM`
key holding the language's name in its own tongue (e.g. `"Français (France)"`) — `LanguageService`
reads it to build the runtime language list, so the new language appears in the UI automatically.
When a generated file is large, write it in ~10–12 KiB chunks, each
ending on a whole line. The shipped languages are: en-GB (source), el-GR, fr-FR, de-DE,
