# EnvoyMesh — AGENTS.md

## Project Overview

EnvoyMesh is a **decentralized, peer-to-peer mesh for autonomous AI agents**. Agents discover each other, negotiate tasks, share data, and communicate without any central server or cloud dependency. Identity is cryptographic (Ed25519), messages are signed, security is policy-based, and everything is auditable.

**Core principles:**
- No central account server — identity is self-sovereign (Ed25519 keys → DIDs)
- Local-first / distributed — libp2p direct paths, optional CID-verifiable data
- Security by isolation — Diplomat (network) / Bond Engine (policy) / Brain (model) / Vault (data) separation
- Semantic consistency — typed intents agents can reason about, not opaque bytes
- Observability — JSONL audit with correlation IDs stitching multi-peer flows

**Mobile app (product):** **EnvoyGo** — Flutter thin client in `apps/envoygo/`. Pairs to a home node; UI + JSON-RPC over WebSocket/libp2p. This is what "mobile / phone / iOS / Android" means in this repo.

**Capacitor backup removed:** the Phase 11 `apps/mobile/` + in-process `mobile-node` / `mobile-storage` / `mobile-vault` stack was deleted (it was a backup experiment, not the product path). `packages/mobile-identity` survives as the browser-safe identity used by the Social web build — do **not** remove it.

**Active roadmap:** See `docs/implementation-plan.md`. Phase 45 (web content browsing) and later work target Social (desktop) + **EnvoyGo** (mobile).

## Key Concepts & Architecture

### Identities (three-tier)

| Identity | Derivation | Purpose |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| **Owner** | `envoy:owner:<sha256(pubkey)>` | Long-lived human identity, signs mandates & device certificates |
| **Device** | `envoy:device:<sha256(pubkey)>` | A specific device (laptop, phone, server), authorized by owner |
| **Agent** | `envoy:agent:<sha256(ownerId + agent-pubkey)>` | AI agent running on owner's node, authorized by owner-signed mandate |
| **Peer** | `envoy_<sha256(pubkey)>` | Runtime identity for message signing (lasts as long as the key) |

**Agent identity** (Phase 9): The agent has its own peer ID derived from `sha256(ownerId + agent-pubkey)`. The owner signs a mandate/credential linking the agent to the owner. Peers can verify: "This agent is authorized by `envoy:owner:abc123`."

Every outbound message envelope is Ed25519-signed by the sender's private key. Recipients verify using the included public key, which must hash to the claimed `senderPeerId`.

### Envelopes (EnvoyEnvelope)

All communication uses a signed envelope:
```typescript
interface EnvoyEnvelope {
  version: "0.1";
  messageId: string;
  correlationId?: string;
  createdAt: string;          // ISO 8601
  senderPeerId: string;
  senderPublicKey: string;    // PEM
  senderRole: "human" | "agent" | "system";
  recipientPeerId?: string;
  recipientRole: "human" | "agent" | "system";
  intent: EnvoyIntent;        // one of 40+ typed intents
  payload: unknown;           // typed per intent
  signature: string;          // Ed25519 over canonical JSON of the rest
}
```

Role policy is enforced in the schema: `chat.message` requires senderRole=human + recipientRole=human. Task intents require senderRole=agent + recipientRole=agent. Agents can communicate directly (agent-to-agent) using any intent appropriate for agents (knowledge.query, discovery.request, etc.).

### Signing convention

All signed objects follow the same pattern:
1. Define an `Unsigned*` type (without `signature`)
2. Define a `*` type (with `signature`)
3. Provide `forSigning()` helper that strips the signature field
4. Sign using `signCanonicalPayload(unsigned, privateKey)` — signs the canonical JSON (sorted keys, no undefined values)
5. Verify using `verifyCanonicalPayload(unsigned, signature, publicKey)`

This applies to: Envelopes, Device Certificates, Device Revocation Records, Mandates, Proofs of Intent, Data Transfer Vouchers, Human Profiles.

### Mandates & Tasks

A **mandate** is an owner-signed authorization document that grants a device permission to perform a task within defined bounds:
- `taskIntent` — what task is authorized
- `allowedActions` / `disallowedActions` — what operations are OK
- `maxSensitivity` — data sensitivity ceiling
- `maxCost` — spending limit
- `expiresAt` — deadline
- `closeOnFirstCompletedResult` / `collectCompletedResults` — termination policy
- `requiresApprovalFor` — actions that need human approval

**Task lifecycle**: `created → planned → discovering → negotiating → waiting_for_peer|waiting_for_owner → running → partial → completed|failed|cancelled`

Peer-to-peer task negotiation uses `task.mandate → task.propose → task.negotiate → task.accept|task.reject → task.result` with heartbeat and cancel intents.

### Trust & Bonds

Trust has four tiers, enforced by `@envoymesh/bonds`:
- **blocked** — all requests denied
- **public** (stranger) — only bond request / ping allowed; everything else denied or requires challenge
- **referred** — knowledge queries get public sensitivity, most else requires approval
- **direct** — up to friends sensitivity; `knowledge.query` allowed

### Security Architecture

The **Diplomat → Bond Engine → Brain → Vault** pipeline:
1. **Diplomat** (network-facing `@envoymesh/network`) — libp2p connections, message parsing, rate limiting, size caps. No direct filesystem or model access.
2. **Inbound Guard** (`apps/node/src/inbound-guard.ts`) — checks size, schema, signature, replay dedup
3. **Bond Engine** (`@envoymesh/bonds`) — deterministic policy decisions based on trust tier, intent, requested sensitivity
4. **Task Runtime Guard** (`apps/node/src/task-runtime-guard.ts`) — enforces mandate expiry, cancellation, collect-N termination
5. **Brain** (`@envoymesh/models`) — receives only approved context, has semantic firewall guard
6. **Vault** (`@envoymesh/vault`) — path-safety enforced, deny-by-default

### Semantic Firewall

`@envoymesh/models` includes a deterministic pre-model filter:
- Empty prompt → reject
- Exceeds 48K chars → reject
- Contains disallowed control characters (code < 32 except tab/newline/CR, or DEL) → reject
- Collapses excessive newline runs (>50 consecutive) to prevent log spam

### Product mobile: EnvoyGo (`apps/envoygo`)

EnvoyGo is the **product mobile app** (Flutter). It is a **thin client** to the home node:

- Pairs via QR (`envoy://pair?...` / thin-client pairing)
- Talks to home over WebSocket / libp2p circuit relay (`HomeRemoteClient` → JSON-RPC)
- Does **not** run an in-process mesh node for product features
- New mobile UX (chat, calls, terminals, Browser, …) lands here

```
EnvoyGo (phone) ── JSON-RPC / events ──► Home Node (computer)
                                           │
                                           └── mesh (bonds, library.read, chat, …)
```

### Capacitor backup (Phase 11) — removed

The Capacitor full-node-in-WebView stack (`apps/mobile/` + `packages/mobile-node` / `mobile-storage` / `mobile-vault`) was **removed**. It was a backup / legacy experiment, not the product path. `packages/mobile-identity` remains: it provides browser-safe pure-JS Ed25519 (`@noble/curves`) that the Social web app's Vite build aliases as `@envoymesh/identity` — keep it.

Historical details: Phase 11 in `docs/implementation-plan.md`.

### Agentic Topology (Phase 9)

**Relay nodes stay lean** — they handle connectivity, relay check-in/lookup, and routing hints. They do not run LLMs, read payloads, execute agents, or store private knowledge.

**Normal nodes are intelligent edges** — they run LLMs, vault RAG, tools, agents, and policy checks.

**The AI agent runs on the home node** — it has its own peer identity (`envoy_agent_<hash>`), derived from the owner's identity and signed by a mandate. Peers can verify the agent is authorized by this owner.

**External agents (OpenClaw/HomeClaw) must not call libp2p directly** — they must use Envoy local tools (`mesh.findKnowledge()`, `mesh.findContact()`, `mesh.sendMessage()`, etc.). EnvoyMesh is the secure network extension of the local agent, not a raw socket handed to the agent.

**MCP compatibility** (future): Phase 9 tool registry could expose MCP endpoints, allowing MCP-compatible clients to use the agent's tools.

**Ordering rule for agentic work:**
1. Direct bonded-contact workflows first (`knowledge.query`, chat assist)
2. Contact-scoped discovery and sharing second
3. Tool/agent boundaries third
4. Stronger sandbox before anonymous discovery or broadcast
5. Broad autonomy last

## Development Commands

```bash
# Install all dependencies
npm install

# TypeScript type-check (uses project references for all packages)
npm run typecheck

# ====== Test orchestrator (recommended) ======
#
# Unified entry point in scripts/test.sh / scripts/test.ps1
# Phases: typecheck → unit → social-build → e2e-fast → e2e-playwright → smoke → bundle
#

npm run test:orchestrator -- dev    # Fast dev loop (~35s, no E2E)
npm run test:dev                    # same as above
npm run test:full                   # All tests + libp2p E2E + smoke (~10min)
npm run test:bundle                 # `full` + scripts/bundle.sh (pre-release gate)
npm run test:ci                     # Same as `full` + bail + JUnit

# Or call directly (more flags available):
bash scripts/test.sh dev --filter "nodeService-fleet-manifest" --watch
bash scripts/test.sh full --no-typecheck --skip-playwright
bash scripts/test.sh bundle --no-typecheck   # pre-release gate (skip tsc)

# View CLI help
npm run cli -w @envoymesh/node -- --help
```

### Test orchestrator (`scripts/test.sh` / `scripts/test.ps1`)

A single entry point that runs the right tests for the right context. Six modes:

| Mode     | typecheck | unit | social-build | e2e-fast | e2e-playwright | smoke | bundle.sh | bail |
|----------|:---------:|:----:|:------------:|:--------:|:--------------:|:-----:|:---------:|:----:|
| `dev`    |     ✓     |  ✓   |      –       |    –     |       –        |   –   |     –     |  –   |
| `unit`   |     ✓     |  ✓   |      –       |    –     |       –        |   –   |     –     |  –   |
| `e2e`    |     –     |  –   |      ✓       |    ✓     |       ✓        |   –   |     –     |  –   |
| `full`   |     ✓     |  ✓   |      ✓       |    ✓     |       ✓        |   ✓   |     –     |  –   |
| `ci`     |     ✓     |  ✓   |      ✓       |    ✓     |       ✓        |   ✓   |     –     |  ✓   |
| `bundle` |     ✓     |  ✓   |      ✓       |    ✓     |       ✓        |   ✓   |     ✓     |  ✓   |

Flags: `--filter PATTERN` `--bail` `--no-typecheck` `--no-build` `--watch`
`--artifacts DIR` `--skip-playwright` `--quiet`.

Each phase logs to `ci-artifacts/test/<phase>.log`. The CI workflow uploads
this whole directory as an artifact on failure.

Full reference: `docs/test-orchestrator.md`.

### Test conventions

- Tests live in `packages/*/test/` and `apps/*/test/`
- Filename matches: `<module>.test.ts` or `<module>.test.tsx`
- React component tests use `@testing-library/react` with jsdom environment (`/** @vitest-environment jsdom */`)
- E2E tests gate on `RUN_E2E=1` environment variable (the orchestrator handles this per phase)
- Uses Vitest with `describe`/`it`/`expect`
- Vitest config maps `@envoymesh/*` imports to source `.ts` files for direct testing without build
- Tests are run via the orchestrator (`npm run test:*`) or directly via `npm test` / `npx vitest` (watch mode)

### Testing relays

**Community relay** — exported as `DEFAULT_ENVOY_COMMUNITY_RELAY_BOOTSTRAP_ADDR`
from `packages/api/src/default-bootstrap.ts:15`:
`/ip4/47.93.11.212/tcp/4001/p2p/12D3KooWLNR4WYWHBswe8ux5zWsy6cuGywnYPJbdbaAbbpmJMjbo`

Use it as a TCP-reachable bootstrap peer for relay-E2E tests. Override with
`TEST_RELAY_ADDR=/ip4/.../p2p/...` (exported env var) to point a test at a
private relay instead.

**What it serves:** rendezvous / `relay.checkin`+`relay.lookup` discovery **and**
circuit-relay-v2 reservations when the host runs a current `apps/relay` build
with `--advertise-addr` (auto public-mode). Historically (2026-07-10) a stale
deploy looked “discovery-only” (identify / reservation handshake failed); that
was a **version skew / missing public-mode** ops issue, not product intent.
Override the live target with `TEST_RELAY_ADDR=/ip4/.../p2p/...` for private
fleet relays.

| Test family | Use community relay? | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `relay-chat-e2e.test.ts`, `wan-relay-signoff-e2e.test.ts`, `agent-e2e-real.test.ts` | ✅ default | TCP bootstrap + discovery; circuit hop when the live host is healthy |
| `relay-broadcast-e2e.test.ts` (broadcast fanout via relay) | ✅ defaults to community cn-relay | Needs a relay that supports our libp2p protocol version **and** the broadcast-fanout handler. Override with `TEST_RELAY_ADDR=<private>`. |
| `geo-discovery-wan-signoff.test.ts` (`geo:city:US-geo-signoff` topic) | ⚠️ gated on `GEO_WAN_DISABLE_GATE=0` | Live DHT is loaded with publishers from many concurrent test runs; `searchPeers` times out at 180 s. Pass ≈1 in 3 runs |

Existing patterns:
- `const RELAY_ADDR = process.env.TEST_RELAY_ADDR || DEFAULT_ENVOY_COMMUNITY_RELAY_BOOTSTRAP_ADDR;`
- `const itRelayed = RELAY_ADDR ? it : it.skip;`
- `describe.skipIf(!RELAY_ADDR)` for the file-level gate

This file-level gate is the right shape: missing relay = whole describe
skipped (no per-test pollution); present relay = all `it`s in the describe
run against the live relay, with each test re-deciding via `itRelayed`.

## Code Conventions & Patterns

### General style

- **TypeScript**: Strict mode, ES2022 target, NodeNext module resolution
- **Module format**: ES modules (`"type": "module"`) — always use `.js` extensions in relative imports (per NodeNext conventions), e.g. `import { foo } from "./bar.js"`
- **Path aliases**: `@envoymesh/*` only for cross-package imports; in-package imports use relative paths
- **Formatting**: Consistent with the existing code — trailing commas in multiline, no semicolons, 2-space indentation
- **Naming**: camelCase for functions/variables, PascalCase for types/interfaces, kebab-case for files
- **Module size (Codex LOC rule)**: target modules under **500** lines; if a file exceeds roughly **800** lines, add new functionality in a **new module** instead of extending the file (unless there is a strong documented reason). Existing v1.x oversized modules are allowlisted in `scripts/module-size-allowlist.json`; CI (`scripts/check-module-size.mjs`) fails on new growth above 800. Removing an allowlist entry is a good sign.

### Package conventions

Each package follows:
- `src/index.ts` — public API (re-exports)
- `src/<module>.ts` — implementation
- `test/<module>.test.ts` — tests
- `package.json` with `"type": "module"`, `"main"`, `"types"`, `"exports"` fields per the existing pattern
- `tsconfig.json` referencing the base config

### Zod-driven design

Protocol schemas are defined in `@envoymesh/protocol` using Zod. **Every** payload type has:
1. A Zod schema (e.g. `TaskProposePayloadSchema`)
2. A TypeScript type derived from it (e.g. `type TaskProposePayload = z.infer<...>`)
3. A `parse*` function that validates and returns the typed payload
4. A `create*` function that constructs valid payloads with sensible defaults

This means runtime validation is always available — every inbound payload goes through its schema.

### Audit-first design

Almost every operation produces an audit event:
- Use `createAuditEvent()` from `@envoymesh/local-store`
- Audit events carry: `eventId`, `createdAt`, `type`, `intent`, `outcome` ("allow" | "deny" | "record"), `summary`, `remotePeerId`, `correlationId`, `latencyMs`
- JSONL append is serialized via `createSerialJsonlAppender()` to prevent interleaved writes
- Never store raw payloads in audit logs unless necessary

### Error handling

- Expected error cases return explicit discriminated union types (e.g. `{ ok: true } | { ok: false; reason: string }`)
- Schema validation errors (ZodError) are caught and converted to user-readable strings
- Filesystem "not found" errors are handled gracefully via `isMissingFileError()` helper
- Malformed A2A payloads in runtime guards are silently caught — the dispatcher already validated them

### File I/O patterns

- JSONL for append-only logs (audit, journal, approval queue, discovery events) — uses serial appender to prevent corruption
- JSON for state files (trust store, peer directory, profile, relay state) — write through atomic rename (write to `.tmp` then `rename`)
- File modes: `0o600` for all data files
- File reads: handle `ENOENT` gracefully with sensible defaults

### Canonical JSON

All signing uses `canonicalJson()` which:
1. Sorts object keys lexicographically
2. Filters out `undefined` values
3. Recurses into nested objects and arrays

This ensures deterministic serialization regardless of property insertion order.

## CI Pipeline

| Workflow | Trigger | What it does |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| `ci-smoke-local.yml` | PR + manual | Install → typecheck → unit tests → two-node smoke → generate/upload artifacts |
| `tauri-release.yml` | Tag `v*` (e.g. `v0.2.2`) + manual | Build/sign Tauri desktop bundles + `latest.json` on that Release (attach iOS/Android yourself) |

---

## Important Nuances

- **`return` vs `return` in expressions**: The project uses early returns with no-semicolon style consistently.
- **`node:crypto` / `node:fs/promises` / `node:path`**: Always use the `node:` prefix for Node.js built-in imports.
- **`Uint8Array` vs `Buffer`**: `Buffer` is used in `@envoymesh/vault` for byte length; `Uint8Array` everywhere else. When converting, use `Buffer.from()` or `Buffer.byteLength()`.
- **libp2p streams**: Use `byteStream(stream)` from `@libp2p/utils` for reading/writing. The stream lifecycle must be managed carefully — always close or abort after use.
- **Relay protocol**: The relay subsystem has its own protocol schemas (`relay.checkin`, `relay.lookup`, `relay.join.request`, etc.) with a hierarchical relay graph (ancestor / parent / sibling / child). The relay manager runtime state is inspected via snapshots encoded as audit events.
- **`tsx` vs `tsc`**: Use `tsx` for running TypeScript directly in development. Use `tsc -b` for production builds and typechecking.
- **Workspace scripts**: Use `npm exec -w @envoymesh/<name> -- <command>` or `npm run <script> -w @envoymesh/<name>` to run scripts in a specific workspace.
- **EnvoyMesh is an end-user product (not a developer tool)**: the user types into Tauri EnvoyAI; the Social UI renders the chat reply; the bond-trace panel surfaces debug info. **Every user-facing string must be end-user-readable**, not developer-jargon. The same field (e.g. `setupSponsorFriendLastErrorKind`) shown to a developer in the audit log can stay as `lastErrorKind: network-unreachable`, but the chat reply should read as plain language: "Couldn't reach the sponsor — the network kept dropping. Try again, or check your relay is online." Internal fields (`cooldownUntil`, `attempts`) belong at the bottom of a verbose failure block, not the headline. **Default = end-user first, developer second.** The developer gets the audit log + the verbose block; the chat user gets the headline + the next step.
