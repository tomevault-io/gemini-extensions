## RULE 0 - THE FUNDAMENTAL OVERRIDE PREROGATIVE

If I tell you to do something, even if it goes against what follows below, YOU
MUST LISTEN TO ME. I AM IN CHARGE, NOT YOU.

---

## RULE NUMBER 1: NO FILE DELETION

**YOU ARE NEVER ALLOWED TO DELETE A FILE WITHOUT EXPRESS PERMISSION.** Even a
new file that you yourself created, such as a test file. You must always ask and
receive clear, written permission before deleting a file or folder of any kind.

---

## Irreversible Git & Filesystem Actions - DO NOT EVER BREAK GLASS

1. **Absolutely forbidden commands:** `git reset --hard`, `git clean -fd`,
   `rm -rf`, or any command that can delete or overwrite code/data must never be
   run unless the user explicitly provides the exact command and states, in the
   same message, that they understand and want the irreversible consequences.
2. **No guessing:** If there is any uncertainty about what a command might
   delete or overwrite, stop immediately and ask the user for specific approval.
3. **Safer alternatives first:** When cleanup or rollbacks are needed, use
   non-destructive inspection first: `git status`, `git diff`, backups, or
   explicit hand-written patches.
4. **Mandatory explicit plan:** Even after explicit user authorization, restate
   the command verbatim, list exactly what will be affected, and wait for
   confirmation that your understanding is correct.
5. **Document the confirmation:** When running any approved destructive command,
   record the user text that authorized it, the command actually run, and the
   execution time in your final response.

---

## Git Branch: ONLY Use `main`, NEVER `master`

When this directory is a git repository, the default branch is `main`.

- All work happens on `main`.
- Never create, switch to, or push feature branches unless the user explicitly
  overrides this file.
- Never reference `master` in code or docs. If you see it, treat it as a bug.
- If the remote also needs a legacy `master` ref, synchronize it from `main`
  only when the user or project automation asks for that exact operation.

---

## RULE 2: NO GIT BRANCHES. NO GIT WORKTREES. EVER.

`main` is the one and only branch. There is no "temporary" branch, no per-agent
branch, no per-task branch, and no scratch worktree.

### FORBIDDEN

- `git branch <anything-other-than-main>`
- `git checkout -b <foo>` or `git switch -c <foo>`
- `git worktree add ...`
- Pushing non-main refs to `origin`
- Creating pull requests or draft PRs from feature branches
- Working in scratch clones at paths like `/tmp/frankensim-*`,
  `/data/projects/frankensim-*`, or `~/projects/frankensim-*` to isolate work
- Using any tool or harness that creates branches or worktrees as a side effect

### WHAT YOU DO INSTEAD

- Commit directly to `main` when the user asks for commits and the work is ready.
- Keep unfinished work in the working tree.
- Coordinate through Agent Mail reservations when multiple agents are active.
- Use Beads issue IDs and file reservations as the isolation mechanism, not git
  branches.
- If another agent changed files, do not revert or stash their work. Work with
  the current tree.

---

## Project Truth Sources

This repository is currently plan-first. The authoritative design document is:

- `COMPREHENSIVE_PLAN_FOR_FRANKENSIM.md`

Read it before broad design work. It defines the Decalogue, architecture,
roadmap, crate atlas, Gauntlet verification program, performance targets, and
flagship pipelines. This `AGENTS.md` is the operating contract for agents; the
plan is the technical constitution.

If a `README.md`, crate `CONTRACT.md`, `TESTING.md`, or `.beads/` directory is
added later, read the relevant files before making nontrivial edits.

---

## FrankenSim - This Project

FrankenSim is intended to be a single memory-safe Rust continuum for:

- computational geometry
- certified representation conversion
- physics simulation
- adjoint and derivative-free optimization
- uncertainty quantification
- rendering and scientific visualization
- replayable design ledgers and agent-native orchestration

The mission is not to wrap legacy CAD/FEM/CFD/optimization tools. The mission is
to build one typed algebra where geometry, fields, operators, derivatives, error
bounds, budgets, provenance, and cancellation travel together through every
layer.

### Load-Bearing Principles

- **Pure Rust first:** runtime dependencies are limited to `std`, asupersync,
  FrankenSQLite, FrankenNumpy, FrankenTorch, FrankenScipy, FrankenPandas, and
  FrankenNetworkx.
- **Memory safety:** default code must be safe Rust. `unsafe` is allowed only in
  narrow audited leaf modules where there is no safe alternative.
- **Determinism:** deterministic mode must be bit-stable across runs and thread
  counts on the same ISA wherever the plan claims it.
- **Cancellation-correct compute:** every unit of compute runs under explicit
  asupersync scopes and checks cancellation at bounded tile boundaries.
- **Budgets first:** accuracy, time, memory, and capability budgets are explicit
  values, not comments.
- **Certificates over vibes:** error bounds, adjoints, convergence orders,
  watertightness, topology, and stochastic claims need executable evidence.
- **One data model:** complexes and cochains are the shared substrate for
  geometry and physics.
- **Provenance-complete:** artifacts are content-addressed; operations are
  replayable through the Design Ledger.
- **Agent-first:** units, seeds, budgets, versions, and capabilities are always
  explicit.

---

## Toolchain: Rust & Cargo

Use Cargo for Rust builds. Do not introduce another package manager unless the
user explicitly asks for a non-Rust subproject.

Expected baseline when the workspace exists:

- Rust 2024 edition.
- Cargo workspace with flat `fs-*` crates.
- `#![deny(unsafe_code)]` at crate or module level wherever practical.
- Explicit feature flags for frontier/moonshot capabilities.
- Release profile changes must justify the performance, determinism, and
  cancellation tradeoffs.

### Dependency Policy

Production runtime dependencies must stay Franken-only:

- `std`
- `asupersync`
- `FrankenSQLite`
- `FrankenNumpy`
- `FrankenTorch`
- `FrankenScipy`
- `FrankenPandas`
- `FrankenNetworkx`

No BLAS, LAPACK, C, C++, Fortran, OpenCASCADE, gmsh, FEniCS, MFEM, OpenFOAM,
SU2, ParaView SDKs, Python runtime requirements, or FFI-backed numerical
shortcuts in production paths.

Development-only references and comparison oracles are acceptable only when they
are isolated, documented, and not in the production dependency graph.

### Unsafe Code

Unsafe is a last resort and must be treated as an auditable boundary:

- Prefer safe Rust, const generics, ownership, and explicit layouts first.
- Keep unsafe leaves small, local, and behind safe facades.
- Candidate unsafe zones: SIMD microkernels, arena allocation internals, memory
  mapping, architecture dispatch, exact low-level layout handling.
- Each unsafe exception needs a documented invariant, tests, and preferably a
  ledger/contract entry once the repo has the relevant artifacts.
- Never use unsafe to paper over lifetime, aliasing, cancellation, or
  synchronization design problems.

---

## Architecture

FrankenSim is organized as layers. Respect the dependency direction: lower
layers know nothing about higher layers.

| Layer | Name | Responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| L0 | SUBSTRATE | hardware topology, arenas, SIMD dispatch, two-lane execution, determinism |
| L1 | BEDROCK | dense/sparse/FFT math, certified arithmetic, AD, RNG/QMC |
| L2 | MORPH | Regions, charts, representation routing, meshing, geometry certificates |
| L3 | FLUX | FEEC/DEC physics, CutFEM, LBM, BEM/FMM, solvers, adjoints |
| L4 | ASCENT | shape/topology/global/Bayesian/multi-objective optimization |
| L5 | LUMEN | path tracing, direct chart rendering, scientific visualization |
| L6 | HELM | FrankenScript IR, sessions, capabilities, ledgers, planner, reports |

### Dependency Direction

- `fs-substrate` and `fs-exec` may depend on asupersync and low-level utility
  crates.
- BEDROCK crates can depend on SUBSTRATE but not on MORPH, FLUX, ASCENT, LUMEN,
  or HELM.
- MORPH can depend on BEDROCK and SUBSTRATE.
- FLUX can depend on MORPH, BEDROCK, and SUBSTRATE.
- ASCENT can depend on FLUX, MORPH, BEDROCK, and SUBSTRATE.
- LUMEN can depend on MORPH, FLUX field abstractions, BEDROCK, and SUBSTRATE.
- HELM can orchestrate all layers, but lower layers must not call HELM.

If you need to violate this, stop and redesign the API.

---

## Planned Workspace Crates

Appendix A of the plan is the authoritative crate atlas. The rough intended
shape is:

### L0 / L1

- `fs-substrate` - architecture detection, topology fingerprints, dispatch
- `fs-simd` - portable SIMD, NEON, AVX-512, exploratory SME2 tiers
- `fs-alloc` - scope arenas, huge pages, pools
- `fs-exec` - asupersync-backed two-lane executor and deterministic reductions
- `fs-la` - GEMM, small dense batches, TSQR, LOBPCG/Lanczos, mixed precision
- `fs-sparse` - BSR, SELL-C-sigma, SpMV/SpMM, AMG
- `fs-fft` - Stockham FFTs, real transforms, 3D pencils
- `fs-ivl` - interval, affine, Taylor models, exact predicates
- `fs-cheb` - Chebyshev/Fourier function objects and spectral eigenproblems
- `fs-ad` - duals, FrankenTorch tape bridge, adjoint support
- `fs-rand` - Philox, Sobol/Owen, distributions
- `fs-ga` - projective and conformal geometric algebra

### L2 / L3

- `fs-geom` - Regions, charts, Rep Router, sheaf certificates
- `fs-rep-sdf`, `fs-rep-frep`, `fs-rep-nurbs`, `fs-rep-mesh`,
  `fs-rep-voxel`, `fs-rep-neural`
- `fs-xform` - FFD, RBF, level-set velocity, manifold harmonics, SIMP fields
- `fs-mesh` - dual contouring, Delaunay/Ruppert, anisotropic remeshing
- `fs-feec` - FEEC families, exact sequences, DWR
- `fs-cutfem` - ghost penalty and cut quadrature
- `fs-iga` - spline elements and shells
- `fs-solid`, `fs-lbm`, `fs-bem`, `fs-fmm`, `fs-vpm`
- `fs-time`, `fs-couple`, `fs-adjoint`, `fs-uq`

### L4 / L5 / L6

- `fs-eproc` - e-processes, e-BH, conformal e-prediction
- `fs-opt` - L-BFGS, TR-Newton-Krylov, CMA-ES, BO, NSGA, PDHG
- `fs-topo` - SIMP, level-set, ground structure, homogenization, persistence
- `fs-sos` - moment/SOS, Burer-Monteiro SDP, Lyapunov certificates
- `fs-surrogate` - neural operators, POD-DEIM, Koopman, certify-or-escalate
- `fs-render`, `fs-viz`, `fs-img`
- `fs-ir` - FrankenScript, catalog, admission
- `fs-session` - capabilities, governor, idempotency
- `fs-ledger` - schema, content addressing, time travel, explain
- `fs-plan` - cost/error models, budget allocator, tropical analytics
- `fs-report` - notebooks and reports via FrankenPandas

Every crate must eventually ship:

- `CONTRACT.md` with invariants, error models, determinism class, and no-claim
  boundaries.
- Unit tests for local behavior.
- Conformance tests for cross-crate semantics.
- Golden or ledger-backed evidence for claims that need replay.

---

## Core Invariants

### Execution and Cancellation

- Every hot kernel is a tile program under an explicit `Cx`.
- Tiles are the unit of scheduling, cancellation, determinism, and NUMA
  placement.
- Kernels must poll cancellation at tile boundaries.
- Cancellation is request -> drain -> finalize, not silent drop.
- Speculative races must cancel and fully drain losing branches.
- Resumable solvers must serialize enough state to pause, migrate, resume, and
  fork deterministically.

### Determinism

- Deterministic reductions use fixed-shape trees keyed by logical tile identity.
- RNG streams are counter-based and keyed by logical identity, not worker thread.
- Tie-breaking must be deterministic.
- Fast mode may relax determinism only when the mode is part of the ledgered
  provenance.

### Geometry

- A `Region` is abstract; concrete representations are charts.
- No chart type is privileged globally.
- Conversions carry cost, error bounds, certificate availability, and
  provenance.
- Rep Router decisions must be reproducible and explainable.
- Watertightness, manifoldness, self-intersection freedom, topology, and
  chart-consistency claims require certificates or explicit no-claim language.

### Physics

- Fields are cochains on complexes where possible.
- Preserve exact discrete sequences: grad/curl/div identities must hold by
  construction for FEEC paths.
- Prefer matrix-free operators and roofline-honest kernels.
- Solvers must expose error estimates, residuals, cancellation points, and
  adjoint hooks when the layer claims gradient support.
- Goal-oriented error estimates should target the actual objective, not generic
  field accuracy.

### Optimization

- Optimization problems are data: typed objective/constraint graphs with
  manifold variables, budgets, seeds, and provenance.
- Gradients must be verified against independent checks before they are trusted.
- Surrogates operate under certify-or-escalate policy.
- Stochastic decisions use anytime-valid confidence/e-process machinery when
  optional stopping is possible.
- Returned optima need KKT/residual/certificate context or honest no-claim
  boundaries.

### Ledger and Agent Interface

- The Five Explicits are mandatory: units, seeds, budgets, versions, and
  capabilities.
- Mutating calls need idempotency keys.
- Failed admission should return structured diagnostics and ranked fixes.
- Every artifact should be content-addressed and explainable through lineage.
- Generated catalogs must come from code/contracts and must not drift by hand.

---

## Ambition Tags

The plan uses three risk tags. Preserve them in docs, feature gates, and status
reports:

- `[S] Solid` - established mathematics and engineering.
- `[F] Frontier` - research-backed, high-upside engineering risk.
- `[M] Moonshot` - novel synthesis; must stay behind feature flags until proven.

Do not promote `[F]` or `[M]` functionality into the default path without
Gauntlet evidence and explicit no-claim boundaries.

---

## The Gauntlet - Correctness Program

The Gauntlet is the definition of "done" for technical claims.

| Tier | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| G0 | property tests and algebraic laws |
| G1 | manufactured solutions and convergence-order verification |
| G2 | canonical benchmarks |
| G3 | metamorphic tests |
| G4 | chaos, cancellation storms, leak/deadlock checks |
| G5 | determinism audits |

When implementing a feature, name the relevant Gauntlet tier in the tests or
docs. If a feature cannot yet satisfy the intended tier, document exactly what
is proven and what is not.

### Certifying the Certifiers

Certificate machinery is security-critical for science:

- Interval/Taylor enclosures need high-precision or independent spot checks.
- e-process validity needs null simulations with adversarial stopping.
- Conformal prediction needs coverage tests under drift scenarios.
- Sheaf/watertightness certificates need adversarial seam tests.
- A false certificate is worse than an ordinary wrong answer.

---

## Performance Program

Performance claims must be roofline-aware and measurable. Do not write "fast"
unless there is a benchmark, target, machine fingerprint, and acceptance band.

Reference target families from the plan:

- Apple Silicon, especially M-series unified-memory machines.
- Many-core x86, especially high-core-count Threadripper/EPYC class systems.

Required habits:

- Track cache-line differences: 128 bytes on Apple aarch64, 64 bytes on x86-64.
- Design for bandwidth-rich and bandwidth-starved schedules.
- Keep CCD/L3 locality in mind on high-core-count x86.
- Resolve SIMD dispatch once, not in hot loops.
- Store performance evidence in ledger/artifacts when that infrastructure
  exists.
- Treat performance regressions as test failures once baselines exist.

---

## Code Editing Discipline

### No Script-Based Code Changes

Do not run broad regex or script-based code rewrites over source files. Make
code changes manually with focused patches. Use structured tools such as
`ast-grep` only when the pattern is genuinely syntactic and the diff can be
reviewed.

### No File Proliferation

Revise existing files in place unless a new file represents genuinely new
functionality or a required contract/test artifact.

Forbidden naming patterns:

- `main_v2.rs`
- `improved.rs`
- `new_version.rs`
- `final_final.rs`
- duplicate experimental copies of existing modules

### Backwards Compatibility

This project is early-stage. Prefer the correct design over compatibility shims.
Do not preserve bad APIs through wrappers unless the user explicitly asks for a
migration layer.

### Comments and Docs

- Document invariants, error models, determinism class, and no-claim boundaries.
- Avoid comments that merely restate code.
- In math-heavy code, include enough references or derivation notes for the next
  agent to verify signs, units, and assumptions.

---

## Output Style

Core library code should not print casually to stdout/stderr.

- Use structured tracing or ledger events for observability.
- CLI output, when added, must be deterministic and documented.
- Errors intended for agents should be structured and actionable.
- Diagnostics should include units, budgets, capability context, and suggested
  fixes when possible.

---

## Compiler Checks

After substantive Rust code changes, verify that the relevant checks pass.
DSR is the first choice for repo-level gates and release builds. Prefer RCH
only for narrow ad hoc Cargo probes or when DSR itself is unavailable.

Typical lanes once the workspace exists:

```bash
dsr quality --tool frankensim
dsr build frankensim --target darwin/arm64
```

If the workspace is still plan-only, do not invent checks. State that no Cargo
workspace exists yet and validate markdown or file presence only.

---

## DSR - Required CI and Release Runner

GitHub Actions is not the CI source of truth for this repository. The account is
throttled/cut off, so agents must always use DSR in preference to GitHub
Actions for repo-level verification, release builds, and fallback release work.

- Use `dsr` if it is on `PATH`; otherwise use
  `/Users/jemanuel/projects/doodlestein_self_releaser/dsr`.
- Run `dsr repos info frankensim` when checking the registry wiring.
- Run `dsr quality --tool frankensim` for the configured quality gate.
- Run `dsr quality --tool frankensim --dry-run` when you need to inspect the
  gate without executing the Cargo workload.
- Run `dsr build frankensim --target darwin/arm64` for the configured native
  release artifact lane. Use `--allow-dirty` only when the user explicitly
  wants a build from the current dirty tree.
- Run `dsr fallback frankensim --version <version>` only for intentional
  release fallback work.
- Use `dsr doctor` and `dsr health all` for DSR/host diagnostics.

Do not wait on, poll, or cite GitHub Actions as required proof unless the user
explicitly asks for that. The workflow files are retained as manual specs and
historical gate documentation, not as automatic merge/release criteria.

When reporting verification, include the exact DSR command, pass/fail status,
and any run log or artifact path DSR prints. If DSR is unavailable, report the
exact blocker and then use RCH or local Cargo only as a clearly labeled fallback.

---

## Testing Policy

Tests scale with risk.

### Unit Tests

Every module should include focused tests for:

- happy paths
- empty/boundary/max cases
- error conditions
- unit/dimension correctness where relevant
- deterministic tie-breaking

### Property and Metamorphic Tests

Use property tests for algebraic laws and invariants:

- chart conversion round trips within certified bounds
- adjoint identity checks
- exact-sequence identities
- rigid transform invariance
- unit-rescaling invariance
- refinement monotonicity
- interval containment under equivalent rewrites

### Concurrency and Cancellation Tests

Concurrency-sensitive code needs deterministic lab-runtime or model-checking
coverage:

- no task leaks
- no arena leaks
- loser branches drained
- cancellation latency bounded at tile boundaries
- pause/resume deterministic equivalence
- panic/fault containment propagates structured errors

### Golden Evidence

Golden artifacts should be deterministic, reproducible, and tied to contracts.
Do not regenerate golden files casually. If a golden changes, explain the
semantic reason and run the relevant verifier.

---

## Documentation and Contracts

Each crate should have a `CONTRACT.md` before it becomes a dependency target for
other crates. A contract should state:

- purpose and layer
- public types and semantics
- invariants
- error model
- determinism class
- cancellation behavior
- unsafe boundary, if any
- feature flags
- conformance tests
- no-claim boundaries

The `COMPREHENSIVE_PLAN_FOR_FRANKENSIM.md` should stay high-level. Do not turn
it into a dumping ground for implementation notes that belong in crate docs,
contracts, or issue records.

---

## Agent Workflow

### Start of Work

1. Read this file.
2. Read `COMPREHENSIVE_PLAN_FOR_FRANKENSIM.md` sections relevant to the task.
3. If present, read `README.md`, crate `CONTRACT.md`, and the relevant Beads
   issue.
4. Inspect the tree before editing.
5. Reserve files through Agent Mail if multiple agents are active and the tools
   are available.

### While Working

- Keep changes tightly scoped.
- Do not disturb unrelated files.
- Do not revert changes you did not make.
- Keep technical claims attached to tests, contracts, or no-claim language.
- Prefer small, reviewable patches.

### End of Work

Before ending a session:

1. Run applicable format/check/test lanes.
2. Report exactly what passed and what did not run.
3. If Beads is in use, update issue status and run `br sync --flush-only`.
4. Release Agent Mail file reservations if you made any.
5. Leave clear handoff notes for any blocker.

---

## MCP Agent Mail - Multi-Agent Coordination

When Agent Mail tools are available, use them for multi-agent coordination and
file reservations.

Typical same-repository flow:

1. Register identity for this project path.
2. Reserve files before editing.
3. Use the Beads issue ID or task name as the thread ID.
4. Send start/progress/completion messages for shared work.
5. Release reservations when finished.

Reservations are advisory, but in this project they are the isolation mechanism.
They replace branches and worktrees.

---

## Beads (`br`) - Issue Tracking

If `.beads/` exists, use Beads for task state and dependency tracking.

Useful commands:

```bash
br ready
br list --status=open
br show <id>
br update <id> --status=in_progress
br close <id> --reason "Completed"
br sync --flush-only
```

Conventions:

- Use Beads IDs in Agent Mail thread IDs and commit messages.
- Do not run bare interactive tools in automated sessions if robot/non-TUI
  modes exist.
- `br sync --flush-only` does not commit; stage and commit intentionally only
  when the user asks for commits or the workflow requires it.

---

## `bv` - Graph-Aware Triage

If `bv` is available and `.beads/` exists, use robot modes only. Bare `bv`
launches an interactive TUI and can block the session.

```bash
bv --robot-triage
bv --robot-next
bv --robot-plan
bv --robot-insights
```

Use `bv` for work selection and dependency insight. Use Agent Mail for
coordination and file reservations.

---

## `ubs` - Bug Scanner

Before committing code, run `ubs` on changed files when available:

```bash
ubs <changed-files>
ubs $(git diff --name-only --cached)
```

Fix true positives at the root cause and rerun on the affected files.

---

## RCH - Remote Compilation Helper

Use DSR first for repo-level gates. Use RCH for CPU-heavy Cargo probes when DSR
does not cover the needed check or when you are intentionally running a narrow
diagnostic:

```bash
rch exec -- env CARGO_TARGET_DIR="${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/rch_target_frankensim_check" cargo check --all-targets
rch exec -- env CARGO_TARGET_DIR="${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/rch_target_frankensim_test" cargo test --all-targets
```

Do not rely on local fallback for heavy builds in a shared-agent environment
unless the user explicitly authorizes it.

Quick diagnostics:

```bash
rch doctor
rch status
rch queue
```

---

## Search Tools

- Use `rg` for fast targeted text search.
- Use `rg --files` to inspect file sets.
- Use `ast-grep` when syntax matters.
- Use project-specific AI search tools only for exploratory architecture
  questions, not for exact symbol searches.

Do not use broad scripted rewrites where a hand patch is safer.

---

## Current Repository State

At the time this file was written, `/Users/jemanuel/projects/frankensim`
contained only:

- `COMPREHENSIVE_PLAN_FOR_FRANKENSIM.md`
- `AGENTS.md`

There was no git repository and no Cargo workspace yet. When those are added,
update this section or replace it with the actual workspace map.

---

## Building P0 First

The coda of the plan says: build P0. Agents should interpret that literally.

Initial implementation should prioritize:

- `fs-substrate`
- `fs-exec`
- `fs-alloc`
- `fs-la`
- `fs-sparse`
- `fs-fft`
- `fs-ivl`
- `fs-rand`
- ledger v0

P0 exit criteria from the plan:

- G0 and G4 green.
- GEMM, SpMV, and FFT within the stated target bands on both reference ISA
  families.
- deterministic mode bit-stable.

Do not start with moonshot features. Keep `[M]` work behind flags and contracts
until the solid spine exists.

<!-- bv-agent-instructions-v2 -->

---

## Beads Workflow Integration

This project uses [beads_rust](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust) (`br`) for issue tracking and [beads_viewer](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer) (`bv`) for graph-aware triage. Issues are stored in `.beads/` and tracked in git.

### Using bv as an AI sidecar

bv is a graph-aware triage engine for Beads projects (.beads/beads.jsonl). Instead of parsing JSONL or hallucinating graph traversal, use robot flags for deterministic, dependency-aware outputs with precomputed metrics (PageRank, betweenness, critical path, cycles, HITS, eigenvector, k-core).

**Scope boundary:** bv handles *what to work on* (triage, priority, planning). `br` handles creating, modifying, and closing beads.

**CRITICAL: Use ONLY --robot-* flags. Bare bv launches an interactive TUI that blocks your session.**

#### The Workflow: Start With Triage

**`bv --robot-triage` is your single entry point.** It returns everything you need in one call:
- `quick_ref`: at-a-glance counts + top 3 picks
- `recommendations`: ranked actionable items with scores, reasons, unblock info
- `quick_wins`: low-effort high-impact items
- `blockers_to_clear`: items that unblock the most downstream work
- `project_health`: status/type/priority distributions, graph metrics
- `commands`: copy-paste shell commands for next steps

```bash
bv --robot-triage        # THE MEGA-COMMAND: start here
bv --robot-next          # Minimal: just the single top pick + claim command

# Token-optimized output (TOON) for lower LLM context usage:
bv --robot-triage --format toon
```

#### Other bv Commands

| Command | Returns |
|---------|---------|
| `--robot-plan` | Parallel execution tracks with unblocks lists |
| `--robot-priority` | Priority misalignment detection with confidence |
| `--robot-insights` | Full metrics: PageRank, betweenness, HITS, eigenvector, critical path, cycles, k-core |
| `--robot-alerts` | Stale issues, blocking cascades, priority mismatches |
| `--robot-suggest` | Hygiene: duplicates, missing deps, label suggestions, cycle breaks |
| `--robot-diff --diff-since <ref>` | Changes since ref: new/closed/modified issues |
| `--robot-graph [--graph-format=json\|dot\|mermaid]` | Dependency graph export |

#### Scoping & Filtering

```bash
bv --robot-plan --label backend              # Scope to label's subgraph
bv --robot-insights --as-of HEAD~30          # Historical point-in-time
bv --recipe actionable --robot-plan          # Pre-filter: ready to work (no blockers)
bv --recipe high-impact --robot-triage       # Pre-filter: top PageRank scores
```

### br Commands for Issue Management

```bash
br ready              # Show issues ready to work (no blockers)
br list --status=open # All open issues
br show <id>          # Full issue details with dependencies
br create --title="..." --type=task --priority=2
br update <id> --status=in_progress
br close <id> --reason="Completed"
br close <id1> <id2>  # Close multiple issues at once
br sync --flush-only  # Export DB to JSONL
```

### Workflow Pattern

1. **Triage**: Run `bv --robot-triage` to find the highest-impact actionable work
2. **Claim**: Use `br update <id> --status=in_progress`
3. **Work**: Implement the task
4. **Complete**: Use `br close <id>`
5. **Sync**: Always run `br sync --flush-only` at session end

### Key Concepts

- **Dependencies**: Issues can block other issues. `br ready` shows only unblocked work.
- **Priority**: P0=critical, P1=high, P2=medium, P3=low, P4=backlog (use numbers 0-4, not words)
- **Types**: task, bug, feature, epic, chore, docs, question
- **Blocking**: `br dep add <issue> <depends-on>` to add dependencies

### Session Protocol

```bash
git status              # Check what changed
git add <files>         # Stage code changes
br sync --flush-only    # Export beads changes to JSONL
git commit -m "..."     # Commit everything
