# AGENTS.md — Working agreement for mectrics

This file is the **source of truth** for conventions in this repository. It applies to any
AI agent or human contributor. `CLAUDE.md` points here.

## 0. Golden rule: English-only repository

**Everything committed to this repo is in English** — no exceptions:

- Source code: identifiers, types, function names, variables.
- Comments and documentation comments.
- All Markdown docs (`README.md`, `docs/**`).
- Commit messages, branch names, PR titles/descriptions.
- User-facing UI strings: **English is the base/development language** (localized to other
  languages via the String Catalog — see §2).

The only place another language may appear is a live chat conversation with the user (who
may write in Turkish). Nothing from that chat leaks into the repo in another language.

## 1. Project shape

- `Packages/MetricsKit/` — UI-independent metric engine (SwiftPM). Providers, scheduler,
  ring-buffer store, engine. **No UI, no localization** (data-only, English identifiers).
  - `swift build`, `swift test`, `swift run mectrics-cli` (live terminal readout).
  - Builds in the **Swift 6 language mode** and must stay warning-free. `MetricProvider`
    requires `Sendable`; providers are `@unchecked Sendable` because the engine samples
    them on one serial queue. Guard anything read outside that queue with a lock.
- `Mectrics/` — the menu bar app (SwiftUI + AppKit).
- `project.yml` — XcodeGen project definition. **This is the source**; `Mectrics.xcodeproj`
  is generated. After editing `project.yml` **or adding/removing source files**, run
  `xcodegen generate`.
- `docs/` — the architecture deep dive, and nothing else. Contributor-facing only: planning
  notes, roadmaps, backlogs, and maintainer-only runbooks do not belong in the public
  repository. The release procedure lives in `scripts/release.sh`, which is self-documenting
  through its required environment variables.

Do **not** commit: `Mectrics.xcodeproj/`, `DerivedData/`, `.build/` (see `.gitignore`).

## 2. Internationalization (i18n)

- All user-facing strings go through `String(localized:)` or SwiftUI `Text`/`Label`.
- Never hardcode user-facing prose as a plain `String` without localization.
- App strings live in `Mectrics/Resources/Localizable.xcstrings`; widget strings live in
  `MectricsWidget/Localizable.xcstrings`. Both catalogs ship English, Turkish, Russian,
  Spanish, French, and Brazilian Portuguese.
- The General Settings language picker is backed by `AppLanguage`. Adding a language means
  adding its case and identifier there, then translating every entry in both catalogs.
- Module display names: use `MetricID.localizedName` (app layer), not the package's
  `displayName` (which is the English fallback).
- Numeric/symbolic menu-bar strings (percentages, rates, arrows) are not localized.

## 3. Menu bar rendering rules

- **Item width must be stable.** Each module reserves a fixed text width from a worst-case
  template (`MetricStatusItem.template(for:)`) and right-aligns text inside it. Item width
  must never depend on the current value's digit count — this prevents items from shifting.
- Use `NSFont.monospacedDigitSystemFont` so digits are equal width.
- If you add a module or change a format, update its template so real values never exceed
  the reserved width.
- **A module may contribute several items.** Components are independent toggles
  (`AppModel.toggleComponent(_:for:)`), so Battery can show icon + health at once.
- **Every component includes a readable value.** A chart-only item is not offered:
  a sparkline with no number cannot be read at a glance.
- **Absence is not zero.** When a reading is missing, render a dash and never fabricate
  `0%` / `0`. Do not offer a component whose data this Mac cannot report.
- Components are picked by clicking a live preview chip, not from a select box — the
  user chooses what they can see.

## 4. Surfaces and Settings

- **The menu bar is the only live surface.** The always-on-top floating panel and its
  global hotkey were removed; the optional **Compact Health** item is the supported
  overview. Do not reintroduce a second always-visible rendering surface.
- **Settings holds configuration, not routine actions.** Quit, copy, and export belong to
  the surfaces that own them (popover, Diagnostics, Attention Log), not to a preferences
  pane. The destructive, one-time app removal action is the sole exception because no
  other surface owns the app lifecycle.
- Every Settings pane uses `Form(.grouped)` and shares one window size — switching tabs
  moves the selection, never the window.
- Prefer progressive disclosure over dimmed controls: hide a control that cannot act yet
  and show its current value as text instead.

## 5. Performance & privacy invariants

- **Zero telemetry.** The only network calls allowed are (optional) update checks. No usage
  or hardware data ever leaves the device.
- Adaptive sampling: faster on AC, slower on battery; pause work that isn't visible —
  a sleeping display, a locked screen, and a switched-away session all count as invisible.
- Keep the hot path allocation-free (the ring buffer is pre-allocated).
- Targets: < 60 MB RAM, low/steady CPU, "Energy Impact: Low" in Activity Monitor.
- `cost` decides how often a provider runs: `.light` every base cycle, `.medium`
  (battery, disk) and `.heavy` (SMC/GPU/sensors) thinned by `SamplingRuntimePolicy`.
- **Never hand AppKit a menu bar image that has not changed.** Assigning `button.image`
  invalidates the status item and round trips to the window server; it costs far more
  than drawing the image did. Status items compare their render inputs first.
- Prefer `IORegistryEntryCreateCFProperty` over `IORegistryEntryCreateCFProperties`:
  copying a driver's whole property dictionary to read one key is orders of magnitude
  more expensive.

## 6. Adding a metric provider

1. Add a `MetricProvider` in `Packages/MetricsKit/Sources/MetricsKit/Providers/`.
2. Return `isAvailable = false` when the hardware/permission is absent (module auto-hides).
3. Add it to `MetricsKit.coreProviders()`.
4. Add menu-bar text in `MenuBarText` (+ a stable template in `MetricStatusItem`).
5. Add popover rows + primary value in `DetailPopoverView` (localized labels).
6. Add a sanity test in `MetricsKitTests`.

## 7. Build / test / run

```bash
# Core engine (no Xcode)
cd Packages/MetricsKit && swift test && swift run mectrics-cli

# App
xcodegen generate
xcodebuild -project Mectrics.xcodeproj -scheme Mectrics -configuration Debug build
```

## 8. Commits

- English, imperative-ish subject; concise body explaining the *why*.
- **Never add Claude (or any AI agent) as a commit contributor/author.** Do not add
  `Co-Authored-By:` trailers, `Generated with` lines, or any AI attribution. Commits are
  authored solely by the human contributor.
- Commit or push only when the user asks. Branch before committing on `main` if unsure.

## 9. Product decisions (fixed)

- Distribution: **Direct / DMG** (Developer ID + notarization).
- Minimum macOS: **15 (Sequoia)**.
- License/model: **free & open source** (no Free/Pro split, no licensing code).
- Repository: **public** since 2026-07-29 (`github.com/farukkamcici/mectrics`). Assume
  anything committed is publicly readable; never commit keys, notary credentials, or
  personal identifiers. Specifically:
  - **No Apple Developer Team ID in the repo.** `project.yml` fills `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM` from
    the `MECTRICS_TEAM_ID` environment variable at generation time; unset means unsigned.
  - **No email addresses.** Contact runs through GitHub (private security advisories, issue
    templates), not a mailbox in a Markdown file.
  - **No personal circumstances in docs.** Write for a contributor who just arrived, not
    for the maintainer. `SUPublicEDKey` in `project.yml` is a *public* key and belongs
    there — the private half never leaves the signing machine's Keychain.
- Decisions that were tried and reversed — the floating panel and its global hotkey, the
  30-day archive and CSV export, kernel memory-pressure and thermal-state alert rules —
  stay reversed. Do not reintroduce them without an explicit decision from the user.

## 10. Public-facing files

The repository is public and is presented as an open source project. Keep these in sync
with reality — a stale claim in `README.md` is a bug:

- `README.md` — **written for someone deciding whether to run the app**, not for someone
  about to work on it. What it does, what it shows, how to get it, what it promises about
  privacy. Build commands, engine internals, and conventions belong in `CONTRIBUTING.md`
  and `docs/architecture.md`; do not migrate them back into the README.
  The banner is a light/dark SVG pair in `docs/assets/` served through `<picture>`, both
  generated by `scripts/generate-banner.py` — regenerate both or neither. It inlines the
  app icon as a data URI, so **changing `AppIcon` means regenerating the banner**; GitHub
  serves the SVG through `<img>`, which blocks every external reference.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — setup, code signing, the development loop, provider and translation
  recipes. It restates the rules; **this file remains the source of truth**, so change
  rules here first.
- `docs/architecture.md` — the technical deep dive: app/engine split, technology rationale,
  the metric source map, rendering rules, performance strategy, repository layout.
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` (Contributor Covenant 2.1), `SECURITY.md` (private reporting via
  GitHub Security Advisories), `CHANGELOG.md` (Keep a Changelog format).
- `.github/` — issue forms, pull request template, Dependabot, and CI.
- `docs/README.md` — index of the docs folder.

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs three jobs on every push and pull request: SwiftPM
build and tests for MetricsKit, an unsigned `xcodebuild` of the app, and repository hygiene
(no generated output committed, no broken relative Markdown links). Adding a file that
breaks a documented link fails the build.

Docs record intent at the time of writing. Where a doc and the code disagree, the code
wins and the doc gets corrected.

## 11. Extending these rules

When the user establishes a new convention, add it here (and reflect it in `CLAUDE.md` if
Claude-specific). Keep this file the single source of truth.
