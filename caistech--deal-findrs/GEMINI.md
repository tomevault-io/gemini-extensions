## Risk Tier: REVENUE

This project holds real company data, financial assessments (property deals, development
finance packs), and Stripe billing state. Apply high read:edit discipline. Shared module
changes require review of all consumers. Deployment errors must be resolved before moving
to new features.

---

## Project Purpose

DealFindrs is a Next.js 14 SaaS for property development opportunity assessment.
Core flows: opportunity creation → AI assessment → RAG status → DevFinance (QS → Valuation
→ Feasibility → Finance Pack). Secondary: voice agent data capture (ElevenLabs), Stripe
billing, company/user management.

## Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js 14 (App Router)
- **Database/Auth:** Supabase (postgres + RLS + Supabase Auth)
- **AI:** OpenAI SDK (direct, not via MCP)
- **Voice:** ElevenLabs SDK + webhook callbacks
- **Billing:** Stripe (webhooks + checkout)
- **Deployment:** Vercel

## AUTHENTICATION CONTRACT (non-negotiable)

Every API route handler MUST call `requireAuth()` before any data operation.
The only exceptions are: `stripe/webhook` (uses Stripe signature verification instead)
and ElevenLabs webhooks (use shared secret header validation).

```typescript
// Required pattern for all API routes
import { requireAuth } from '@/lib/auth/require-auth'

export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  const { user, error } = await requireAuth(request)
  if (error) return NextResponse.json({ error }, { status: 401 })
  // ... rest of handler
}
```

Never use `request.headers.get('x-user-id')` as an auth mechanism.
Never fall back to a hardcoded user ID string.

---

## SUPABASE PATTERNS

### Client initialization
Always use the lazy-init factory pattern:
```typescript
let _client: SupabaseClient | null = null
function getSupabaseAdmin(): SupabaseClient {
  if (!_client) {
    const url = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
    const key = process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
    if (!url || !key) throw new Error('Supabase credentials not configured')
    _client = createClient(url, key)
  }
  return _client
}
```
Never initialize at module level with `!` assertions (causes silent startup failures
in edge environments where env vars may not be available at import time).

### Service role key
Used server-side only. Never import or reference in client components.
Used legitimately in: all `/api/*` route handlers, `src/lib/devfinance/db.ts`.
If you are adding a new client component that needs data, use a server action or
route handler — never pass the service role key to the client.

### RLS
All Supabase tables MUST have RLS enabled. The devfinance schema uses company-scoped
policies via `get_user_company_id()`. Follow this pattern for any new tables.
Check the devfinance-schema.sql for the canonical policy structure.

## API ROUTE CONVENTIONS

```
src/app/api/
  opportunities/         — CRUD for property opportunities
  devfinance/            — QS, valuation, feasibility, affordable gap, finance pack
  assess/                — AI assessment engine
  voice/                 — ElevenLabs voice chat
  webhooks/elevenlabs/   — Voice agent data callbacks
  stripe/                — Checkout, portal, webhook
  company/               — Company creation, invite, join
  admin/                 — User management (requires admin role check)
  site-intel/            — Address-based property intelligence
  abn-lookup/            — ABN validation
```

Route files are named `route.ts`, not `index.ts`.
Export named `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE` — no default export.
Always type the return value: `NextResponse.json<T>(...)`.

---

## DEVFINANCE MODULE ORDER

Modules are generated in strict dependency order:
1. QS Report (construction cost estimate)
2. Valuation Report (GRV, PRSV — requires QS for TDC)
3. Feasibility Study (cash flow, sensitivity — requires QS + Valuation)
4. Affordable Gap Analysis (optional — requires Feasibility)
5. Finance Pack (export — requires all above)

Never skip steps or generate a downstream module without the upstream module being present.
Use `getQSReport()` / `getValuationReport()` from `src/lib/devfinance/db.ts` to resolve
prior versions.

---

## ERROR HANDLING CONVENTIONS

### Webhook helpers
Helper functions called from webhook handlers MUST return `{ error }` or throw — never
silently swallow database operation failures. The top-level handler should surface these:
```typescript
const { error } = await supabase.from('companies').update(...).eq(...)
if (error) {
  console.error('[webhook] company update failed:', error.message)
  // decide: throw to return 500, or continue with degraded state (document why)
}
```

### Side-effect failures
If a secondary operation fails (e.g. activity log insert, profile update), document
explicitly whether this is intentionally non-fatal and why. Do not use
`// Don't fail - X was created` without a structured log.

### Async in webhooks
All webhook helper functions must be `async` and `await`ed. Never fire-and-forget
database writes inside webhook handlers.

---

## TESTING REQUIREMENTS

Zero tests currently exist. Target for any new feature:
- Unit tests for all `src/lib/` functions (assessment logic, devfinance calculations)
- Integration tests for all API routes using `vitest` + `supertest`
- Minimum 30% coverage before shipping a new module

Test files: co-locate at `src/lib/__tests__/` and `src/app/api/**/__tests__/`.

---

## PLATFORM-TRUST INTEGRATION

`src/lib/platform-trust.ts` provides rate limiting, permission gating, and audit logging.
`src/middleware.ts` applies it to all `/api/*` routes.

Platform-trust is NOT an auth layer. It does not verify user identity.
It supplements auth — do not use it as a substitute.

Required env vars (fail loudly if absent):
- `PLATFORM_TRUST_SUPABASE_URL`
- `PLATFORM_TRUST_SERVICE_KEY`
- `PLATFORM_TRUST_PROJECT_ID` (no hardcoded fallback — must be explicit)

---

## STRIPE WEBHOOK SAFETY

Stripe webhooks MUST:
1. Verify the `stripe-signature` header via `stripe.webhooks.constructEvent()` before processing
2. Return `200 OK` quickly (before long DB operations where possible)
3. Be idempotent — duplicate events should not double-write

`handleSubscriptionChange` currently has a logic gap: if `companyId` is not found in
metadata, it looks up by `stripe_customer_id` but then falls through without updating.
Fix by ensuring the resolved `companyId` is used in the final `update()` call.

---

## KNOWN GAPS (as of 2026-04-16)

These are documented here so future sessions complete them, not defer them:

1. **Login/signup not implemented** — `login/page.tsx` and `signup/page.tsx` redirect
   without calling Supabase Auth. Must be implemented before any public access.
2. **No auth middleware** — `requireAuth` helper does not exist. Must be created and
   applied to all API routes before production use.
3. **No test framework** — `vitest` not installed. Address in the next feature sprint.
4. **setup/page.tsx** — `// TODO: Save criteria to Supabase` at line 35. Incomplete feature.

These are not "future work" — they are blocking items for production readiness.

---

## STOP PHRASES (project-specific additions)

In addition to the global stop phrase list, do NOT write:
- "For demo, we'll use a placeholder"
- "In production, validate the JWT"
- "For now, simulate and redirect"
- `|| 'demo-user-id'`

These phrases signal that real auth has been deferred. If found in existing code, fix them.
