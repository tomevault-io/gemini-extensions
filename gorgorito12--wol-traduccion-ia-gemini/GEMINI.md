# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

A localization tool for the **Age of Empires III: Wars of Liberty** mod. It translates the game's
XML string tables (e.g. `stringtabley.xml`) from English into other languages via Google Gemini
(`gemini-2.5-flash`), with aggressive caching so that re-translating across mod versions costs
almost no API calls.

## Commands

```bat
pip install google-genai tqdm          REM core deps; tkinterdnd2 is optional (drag & drop)

REM CLI translation (see docs/USAGE.md for the full flag list)
python translate_gemini.py "INPUT.xml" "OUTPUT.xml" --api-key "KEY" --cache-file "wol_es.cache.json"

REM Cache-only pass: applies cache, never hits the API (preview / rebuild cache)
python translate_gemini.py "INPUT.xml" "OUTPUT.xml" --cache-file "wol_es.cache.json" --cache-only

REM Run the self-tests (the only tests in the repo) and exit
python translate_gemini.py --self-test-quality-gate
python translate_gemini.py --self-test-merge

REM Launch the GUI. Translator.bat is self-sufficient: it resolves a real Python
REM (rejecting the Microsoft Store alias stub), auto-installs Python 3.13 via winget
REM if missing, auto-installs google-genai/tqdm/tkinterdnd2, and launches with the
REM sibling pythonw.exe. Every failure path prints a message and pauses.
python translate_gui.py
```

There is no build, lint, or external test framework. "Tests" = the six `self_test_*` functions in
`translate_gemini.py`: `--self-test-quality-gate` runs four (quality gate, source casing, glossary,
user glossary) and `--self-test-merge` runs two (merge by `_locID`, cache-key parity). Both flags
work without the `input output` positionals. The API key falls back to the
`GEMINI_API_KEY` / `GOOGLE_API_KEY` env vars.

## Architecture

Two files, one engine. **`translate_gemini.py` is both the CLI and the library; `translate_gui.py`
imports it as `tg` and calls its functions directly** (`tg.translate_strings`,
`tg.parse_strings_xml`, `tg.iter_translatable_elements`, `tg.build_skip_rules`). The GUI does *not*
shell out to the CLI. **Consequence: changing the signature or behavior of `translate_strings`,
`parse_strings_xml`, or `iter_translatable_elements` will break the GUI** — check `translate_gui.py`
when touching them.

### Translation pipeline (the core flow)

`main()` → `parse_strings_xml` → `iter_translatable_elements` → `translate_strings` → write XML.

1. **Parse & preserve format.** `decode_auto` detects BOM/encoding, `DocumentFormat` captures
   encoding + newline + BOM + xml-declaration so `serialize_tree` can write the file back
   byte-faithfully. A custom `CommentedTreeBuilder` keeps XML comments. This fidelity matters — the
   game is picky about its string-table format.
2. **Select elements.** `iter_translatable_elements` yields `<string>` and `<plurals><item>` nodes.
   `should_skip_element` (driven by `SkipRules`) marks folder/path-like and user-excluded nodes as
   `skip=True`; skipped text is passed through untouched and re-verified by `assemble_full_texts`.
3. **Protect, then tokenize.** Before sending text to the model, two layers of masking are applied
   *in order*: `protect_phrases` replaces protected phrases/acronyms with `__PROTECT_#__`, then
   `protect_tokens` replaces placeholders (`%s`, `%1$s`, `\n`, …) with `__TOK#__`. After
   translation, `restore_all_tokens` reverses both. If a protected token goes missing in the output,
   the code falls back to the original source string rather than emit a corrupted string.
4. **Cache lookup.** Keyed by the *protected* source text → translated text. Misses are batched.
5. **Batch & parallelize.** `yield_batches` packs strings up to `MAX_BUDGET_BYTES`; a
   `ThreadPoolExecutor` (`--max-workers`, default 8) runs `translate_batch_with_retry` →
   `translate_batch_gemini`. The model is asked for a strict JSON array; `reconcile_batch_length`
   repairs length mismatches (pad with source / truncate) so a bad response never desyncs the list.
6. **Quality gates (Spanish-target only, applied per result).** `apply_postprocess_overrides`
   (Home City→Metrópoli, team→equipo, game ages like *National Age*→*Edad Nacional*),
   `enforce_acronym_integrity`, `apply_source_casing`, and
   `has_english_residue`. These are gated by `target_is_spanish()` so other target languages are
   unaffected. The forced-terminology rules (Home City, team, game ages) live in one place,
   `SPANISH_GLOSSARY` (a list of `GlossaryEntry`): each entry carries the `prompt_hint` fed to Gemini
   *and* the deterministic `output_fixes` applied here, so both layers share one source of truth and
   adding a term is one entry. `output_fixes` run only when the entry's `source_trigger` matches the
   English original, and are anchored to whole phrases (e.g. `(Era|Edad) Nacional`→`Edad Nacional`) —
   never a bare `Era`→`Edad`, since `Era` is also the verb *was*. Guarded by `self_test_glossary`.

   **User glossary (pair-agnostic, NOT Spanish-gated).** `glossary.txt` next to the script (or CLI
   `--glossary-file`): `source term = target term` lines, `#` comments. Loaded by
   `load_user_glossary`; same two-layer philosophy: `user_glossary_rules(batch, glossary)` injects
   prompt rules **only into batches that contain the term** (via `translate_batch_with_retry`'s
   `base_extra_rules`, composed with the strict-retry rules), and `apply_user_glossary_fixes`
   deterministically replaces a source term the model left untranslated (whole-word for Latin,
   plain replace for CJK) — it runs at both postprocess points, so it also fixes cache hits. It
   canNOT fix a wrong-but-translated synonym (that's the prompt layer's job). Glossary changes do
   not alter cache keys, so already-cached strings keep their old wording. Threaded through
   `translate_strings(user_glossary=...)`; the GUI auto-loads `glossary.txt` on each run and its
   "Glosario…" button (Avanzado) creates/opens it. Guarded by `self_test_user_glossary`.
7. **Reassemble & write.** `assemble_full_texts` merges translated + skipped text back in original
   order; `write_output_snapshot` does an atomic write. `progress_callback` writes a snapshot
   periodically so partial progress survives a crash/cancel.

### The cache contract (most important invariant)

The cache is a JSON dict `{protected_source_string: translation}` written to
`<output>.cache.json` by default, or to `--cache-file` (the recommended "one global cache per
language" pattern — see `docs/CACHE_WORKFLOW.md`).

- **Empty string `""` is a sentinel meaning "needs translation / previously failed", not a real
  translation.** Failed batches and quality-rejected strings are stored as `""` *deliberately* so a
  re-run retries them instead of caching a bad result. `_prune_empty_cache` strips these before
  writing to disk; `--retry-empty-cache` forces re-translation of them.
- **Never let a failed batch write the original English back into the cache as if translated** — that
  silently poisons future runs. The existing code guards this (`translated_batch = None` path).
- Cache writes are debounced (`CACHE_FLUSH_EVERY_N_BATCHES` / `CACHE_FLUSH_EVERY_SECONDS`) and
  atomic (`_write_cache_atomic`).

### Resumability

If the output file already exists, `load_existing_translations` re-reads it and seeds
`existing_translations`, so an interrupted run continues instead of restarting. The GUI adds a
`cancel_event` (Stop button) that cancels pending futures mid-run.

### Version updates: merge by `_locID`

The real stable key in the WoL XML is the `_locID` attribute on every `<String>` (NOT `symbol`,
which is sparse). `TranslationTarget.loc_id` carries it. `merge_by_locid(new_targets,
old_source_targets, old_trans_targets)` carries an old translation onto a new source version by
matching `_locID` (with a content/position fallback for duplicate or missing ids — there are a
handful of each). It classifies via `_classify_merge_entry` and only **seeds the cache for safe
cases**:
- `reuse-safe` — English unchanged + a real (non-English) old translation + matching `%`-format
  placeholders (`placeholders_compatible`, which is case-insensitive so `%S`≡`%s`).
- `reuse-cosmetic` — the English changed **only** in markup (`<color=...>`), case, or whitespace
  (`_normalize_for_change` ignores those); the old translation is reused as-is. The new markup is
  **not** re-applied (cosmetic). These are surfaced separately (GUI filter "Revisar formato") so
  they can be re-translated if the color formatting matters.
- `kept-as-source` — old translation equals the English **and** there is nothing translatable
  (`_has_translatable_text` false: pure markup/format/filenames); kept as-is.

Everything else is **not** seeded: `changed-needs-review` (real text change — old translation shown
as a draft, never seeded), `old-equals-source` (English left untranslated, but has real words →
flagged to translate), `new-needs-translation`, `placeholder-mismatch`, `no-old-translation`. The
seed feeds the normal engine via `seed_list_from_report` → `existing_translations`. CLI:
`--match-by-locid` + `--prev-source` + `--prev-translation` (+ optional `--report`). Self-tests:
`--self-test-merge`.

**Cache-key parity is load-bearing:** `protected_cache_key()` (and `protect_for_cache` /
`_normalize_protection`) is the single source of truth for the cache key, used both by
`translate_strings` and by external callers (merge seeding, GUI manual edits) so everyone writes
the keys the engine reads. `self_test_cache_key_parity` guards this.

### GUI: two tabs

`translate_gui.py` wraps the engine in a `ttk.Notebook` with two tabs. Its `main()` is a thin
try/except around `_run_gui()` (the real startup) that shows any startup exception in a
`messagebox` — under `pythonw.exe` there is no console, so without this a construction-time crash
would be invisible. **Tab 1 ("Traductor")** is
the original batch translator, unchanged — `_build_ui(parent)` builds it. **Tab 2 ("Comparar /
WinMerge", `_build_compare_ui`)** is the version-update view: pick new-English / old-English /
old-translation (+ optional cache), `merge_by_locid`, show a `ttk.Treeview` (columns `_locID | New
English | Old English | Translation | Status`) colored by status, edit translations by hand,
auto-translate the gaps with Gemini, then save to cache + export the adapted XML. The default filter
is `diff` ("Differences") — only rows where the English changed (status `changed`/`new`), i.e. what
actually needs work. Selecting a row renders a WinMerge-style new-vs-old English diff with per-word
`ins`/`del` highlighting (`_render_diff` via `difflib.SequenceMatcher`); `MergeEntry.english_old`
carries the old text for this. The "smart" carry-over is the content-keyed cache: unchanged English
auto-maps to its old Spanish, only changed/new strings cost work — nothing in the game XML is touched
until export. Both tabs share one background `worker` thread, `cancel_event`, log queue, and the
`is_alive()` busy-guard (one operation at a time). Note: the "Auto-traducir faltantes" finish step
only fills empty values (`old if old else new`) so it never clobbers manual edits or cache hits.

**Translator tab actions.** Two buttons drive translation: **Traducir** (`_on_run_clicked`) =
cache + Gemini, and **Solo caché** (`_on_cache_only_clicked`) = cache only, no API — both call
`_start_translation(cache_only)` (there is no "Cache only" checkbox). `_set_run_buttons(running)`
enables/disables the Traducir/Solo caché/Stop trio together. Rarely-used options (Retry empty cache,
Verbose, and the **Protected words** field) live under an **Avanzado ▾** toggle
(`_toggle_advanced`). Protected words (comma-separated, persisted in the config) become
whole-word case-sensitive regexes via `_custom_protected_regex()` — regex, not plain terms,
because `protect_phrases` exact terms match substrings ("Ram" would mask inside "Framework").
That list is passed to BOTH `translate_strings` call sites and to every GUI
`protected_cache_key` call (compare-tab prefill/save/build-cache and `_estimate_cost`) so cache
keys stay identical across tabs; adding a word changes the key of strings containing it — they
re-translate once. `_estimate_cost` subtracts strings
already in the cache the run would actually use (explicit field or the automatic per-file one, via
the same `_resolve_paths`), so the cost reflects only what would actually hit the API. Its cost
model prices input and output separately (`COST_PER_M_INPUT_TOKENS` / `COST_PER_M_OUTPUT_TOKENS` —
output is ~8× input and dominates), adds the prompt template once per estimated batch, and counts
CJK characters as ~1 token each (`_approx_tokens`).

**Language pairs.** The Settings row is a "Translate from / to" pair of editable comboboxes
(`self.source_lang` / `self.target_lang`, persisted in the config); both flow into
`translate_strings` at the two GUI call sites. Because the cache key is the source text with NO
language dimension, one cache must never serve two pairs — the GUI enforces this through naming:
`_resolve_paths(input)` (single source of truth for `_run_batch` and `_estimate_cost`) appends
`_pair_suffix()` to the automatic output name (`X_translated_zh-en.xml`, slugs from `_lang_slug` /
`LANG_SLUGS`), and the automatic cache derives from that output name, so pairs self-partition.
**Exception: the historic default pair English→Latin American Spanish keeps the legacy names**
(`X_translated.xml`, `<output>.cache.json`) so existing outputs/caches keep working. Manual
Output-folder/Cache-file fields always win. The Spanish-only quality gates are unaffected: they
key off `target_is_spanish()`, not the GUI.

**Source-language sanity check.** `_start_translation` calls `_maybe_warn_source_language()`:
it samples the first queued file and runs `_detect_language()` (module-level heuristic — Unicode
script counts decide ja/zh/ko/ru/ar; stopword votes with a 1.5× margin decide Latin-script
languages, `None` = inconclusive). On a mismatch it shows Yes/No/Cancel (Yes switches the source
combobox to the detected language). Deliberately conservative and failure-proof: inconclusive
guesses and detector exceptions never block a run. Translator tab only — the CLI and the Compare
tab are untouched.

**Build cache (no API).** The **Compare tab's** "Generar caché (sin API)…" button (`_on_build_cache`
/ `_run_build_cache`) pairs an English XML with its already-translated XML and writes the
English→Spanish cache — `merge_by_locid(eng, eng, es)` (every entry "unchanged", so `seed` = the
reusable Spanish, reusing the placeholder / not-still-English guards) then
`cache[protected_cache_key(eng)] = seed`. No Gemini. This is the robust, by-`_locID` replacement for
the fragile index-based rebuild on this tab (which needs English-in + matching translated-output and
silently discards everything on a length mismatch). Note: `_normalize_protection` now always
prepends `DEFAULT_PROTECTED_TERMS`, so `protected_cache_key()` (used by the builder and the compare
tab) yields the same key `translate_strings` consumes — Translator/CLI keys are unchanged
(`protect_phrases` is idempotent).

**Hover tooltips.** Every control in both tabs has a `Tooltip` (a hover `Toplevel`) attached via
`self._tip(widget, key)`, where the text is `lambda: self.t(key)` so it follows the language. Tooltip
text lives under `tip_*` keys in `TR`. When adding a control, attach a tooltip the same way.

**Per-user state.** `.translate_gui_config.json` (window geometry, last-used paths/languages) is
written next to the script on close and is **gitignored** — never commit it; it once shipped the
author's personal output path to every user.

**UI language (ES/EN).** All user-facing text comes from the module-level `TR` dict via `self.t(key,
**fmt)`; the language selector lives in a persistent top bar. Switching language calls
`_build_layout()`, which destroys and recreates the notebook in the new language. State survives
because every persistent var/list is created once in `_init_state()` (not in the build methods) and
the console log + comparison table are restored after the rebuild. The filter dropdown stores a
stable `cmp_filter_code` (not the translated label) so `_cmp_row_matches_filter` is language-agnostic.
When adding UI strings, add a key to BOTH `TR["es"]` and `TR["en"]` and use `self.t(...)` — a plain
literal won't follow the toggle. The engine's own stdout (from `translate_gemini.py`) stays English;
only the GUI's widgets, dialogs, status, and its own log lines are translated.

### Provider coupling

All Gemini-specific code lives in exactly two functions: `setup_gemini` (client creation) and
`translate_batch_gemini` (the API call). `DEFAULT_MODEL = "gemini-2.5-flash"` is hardcoded inside
`translate_batch_gemini` — it is not yet a CLI/GUI parameter. Everything else (caching, batching,
retries, token protection, XML I/O) is provider-agnostic. Adding another backend (e.g. an
OpenAI-compatible provider) means adding a parallel pair of functions and a `--provider` switch,
not touching the pipeline.

`translate_batch_gemini` sets `thinking_config=ThinkingConfig(thinking_budget=0)`: 2.5 Flash's
default *dynamic thinking* bills its hidden reasoning tokens at the output price and adds nothing
to mechanical translation — do not remove this without a reason (it silently multiplies cost). The
config is built in a try/except so older `google-genai` SDKs without `ThinkingConfig` still work.

## Docs

`docs/USAGE.md` (all flags), `docs/CACHE_WORKFLOW.md` (version-update strategy), and
`docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` (429s, encoding issues) are the authoritative references — prefer updating
them over duplicating flag lists here.
