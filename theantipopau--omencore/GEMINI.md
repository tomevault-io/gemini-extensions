# CLAUDE.md — OmenCore

Guidance for AI agents working in this repo. Read this first, then the current cycle's
`docs/ROADMAP_v*.md` and `docs/CHANGELOG_v*.md`.

## What this is

OmenCore is an open-source replacement for HP OMEN Gaming Hub (OGH) for HP OMEN / Victus laptops
(and some desktops): fan control and curves, performance modes, GPU power (TGP/PPAB), MUX switch,
CPU undervolt / power limits, keyboard RGB, peripheral RGB (Corsair/Logitech/Razer), telemetry.
GitHub: `theantipopau/omencore`. Maintainer: Matt (theantipopau). Users report via GitHub issues,
diagnostics exports (zip/json attached to issues), Discord, forks and PRs.

## Layout

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `src/OmenCore.Core/` | Hardware + service logic shared by all frontends (net8.0-windows) |
| `src/OmenCore.Core/Hardware/` | `HpWmiBios` (HP WMI BIOS calls), `WmiFanController`, `FanController` (EC), `ModelCapabilityDatabase`, `CapabilityDetectionService`, `DeviceCapabilities`, `HardwareWorkerClient`, PawnIO EC/MSR access |
| `src/OmenCore.Core/Services/` | `FanService`, `FanVerificationService`, `HardwareWatchdogService`, `ConfigurationService`, `KeyboardLighting/` backends (`WmiBiosBackend`, `EcDirectBackend`), power/perf services |
| `src/OmenCoreApp/` | Main WPF app (MVVM: `ViewModels/`, `Views/`, `App.xaml.cs`) |
| `src/OmenCore.HardwareWorker/` | Out-of-process LibreHardwareMonitor worker (isolates native crashes: NVML/AMD ADL) |
| `src/OmenCore.Cli/` | CLI |
| `src/OmenCore.Linux/` + `.Linux.Tests/` | Linux daemon/CLI (hp-wmi sysfs), net8.0 |
| `src/OmenCore.Avalonia/`, `src/OmenCore.Desktop/` | Cross-platform UI (Desktop csproj still on old 3.6.3 version — ignore on bumps unless asked) |
| `src/OmenCoreApp.Tests/` | xUnit tests for Core + App (~1650 tests) |
| `installer/OmenCoreInstaller.iss` | Inno Setup installer |
| `docs/` | Per-version CHANGELOG / ROADMAP, evidence docs, bug-report logs |
| `website/` | GitHub Pages site (`pages.yml`) |
| `.github/workflows/` | `ci.yml` (build+test on windows-latest, Linux job), `release.yml` (on tag), `alpha.yml`, `linux-qa.yml` |

## Build & test

```bash
dotnet build OmenCore.sln
dotnet test OmenCore.sln                       # full suite, ~7 min; run in background
dotnet test src/OmenCoreApp.Tests/OmenCoreApp.Tests.csproj --filter "FullyQualifiedName~DeviceCapabilitiesTests"
```

- The full suite must stay green before every push (last known: 1658 App tests + 30 Linux tests).
- Build should be 0 warnings / 0 errors.
- Tests that touch config use `[Collection("Config Isolation")]` and `OMENCORE_CONFIG_DIR` temp dirs.
- Shell is Windows (Git Bash / PowerShell). Repo root is `E:\OmenCore\omencore`.

## Core working discipline (non-negotiable)

1. **Evidence first.** Root-cause from real data: diagnostics exports, logs, the reporter's board ID
   and BIOS version. Download attachments (`github.com/user-attachments/...`) with curl and read them.
   Never guess a fix from the symptom alone.
2. **Evidence gate.** Distinguish clearly between *confirmed* (verified on real hardware by a
   reporter) and *implemented, pending confirmation*. Label them that way in changelogs, roadmap,
   model-database notes and GitHub replies. Never claim hardware behaviour you haven't seen evidence of.
3. **Narrow fixes.** Change only what the evidence supports. Check who else a gate/flag affects
   (e.g. every board in the DB) before broadening or narrowing it; write tests pinning both sides.
4. **Tests with every fix** where feasible — ideally one that fails on the old code.
5. **Honest replies.** When answering on GitHub, say what's fixed, what's pending, what you need from
   the reporter (usually a diagnostics export or a Guided Fan Verification run). Only claim what the
   repo actually contains (e.g. don't say "credited in changelog" before it is).
6. **Credit contributors.** If a PR/fork raised an issue first, credit it even if you reimplement it.
   Check open PRs and forks *before* implementing to avoid duplicate work.
7. **Don't release, tag, close issues or post publicly without the maintainer's go-ahead** unless
   the current instruction clearly covers it.

## Model capability database (`ModelCapabilityDatabase.cs`)

- Boards matched by exact **ProductId** (4-hex board ID, e.g. `8BBE`, `88F8`, `8C2F`).
  `ModelNamePattern` is a fallback only; `RequiredCpuVendor` prevents Intel/AMD variants inheriting
  each other's entry (cause of #115/#172). Unknown boards fall back to a family default
  (Victus family default = 1 fan, which is often wrong).
- New entries: `UserVerified = false` unless a user confirmed it; `Notes` must cite the evidence
  source (issue #, BIOS version, what was verified). Leave unproven features off (curves, GPU boost,
  undervolt) — enable later on evidence.
- Add a `ModelCapabilityDatabaseTests` test for each new entry (resolves exactly, key flags).
- `HasFourZoneRgb` does **not** control zone count; flipping it removes colour control entirely.

## Hard-won technical facts

- **HP WMI BIOS** is the primary control path; EC direct (PawnIO) is the fallback/older path.
  Firmware often *accepts* a command and ignores it (e.g. `SetFanMax`) — verify via readback and
  fall back to direct level writes. Respect each board's real `MaxFanLevel`, never hardcode.
- **Keyboard ColorTable byte 0** = declared zone count. Derived from live `GetKeyboardLightingType()`
  via `HpWmiBios.MapLightingTypeToZoneCount` (single-zone topologies → 1, else 4). #212 fix, pending
  confirmation. `EcDirectBackend` deliberately still hardcodes 4.
- **Victus GPU Power Boost**: backend (`SystemControlViewModel.DetectGpuPowerBoost`) refuses every
  Victus unless `SupportsGpuPowerBoost` is true. `DeviceCapabilities.ShowGpuPowerBoost` mirrors that.
  `HasGpuPowerControl` is set whenever WMI BIOS exists — it is NOT evidence of GPU power support.
- **Fan keepalive** (`WmiFanController.CountdownExtensionCallback`) re-applies state periodically;
  it must stand down while `FanService.IsAnyDiagnosticModeActive` (all branches: preset, Max, manual).
- **Watchdog failsafe** (`HardwareWatchdogService`): releases only after temps ≤65°C held 15s,
  re-applies every 15s while active.
- **Native crashes**: an `AccessViolationException` from NVML/P/Invoke cannot be caught in .NET Core.
  That's why telemetry runs in `OmenCore.HardwareWorker`; `HardwareWorkerClient.ShouldRecoverConnection`
  relaunches it. Skip/quarantine logic lives in the worker's `Program.cs`.
- **Shutdown**: `App.OnExit` always logs "OmenCore shutting down (restoring fans to auto control)...".
  If a user's log lacks it, the process did not exit normally.
- **Config**: `ConfigurationService` must hand out one shared `AppConfig`; `Load()` merges onto the
  existing instance (separate detached copies caused last-writer-wins data loss, #191).
- **OGH conflicts**: OGH services can reset fan/RGB state; conflict detection and cleanup services exist.

## Versioning & docs

- Current released: **4.4.0**. In progress: **4.4.1** (untagged).
- Version lives in: `VERSION.txt`, `installer/OmenCoreInstaller.iss` (`MyAppVersion`), and the
  `<Version>` in the six 4.x `.csproj` files.
- Each cycle has `docs/CHANGELOG_vX.Y.Z.md` (short, user-facing: Fixed / Added / Investigated, Not
  Fixed / Issue Housekeeping) and `docs/ROADMAP_vX.Y.Z.md` (full investigation detail, evidence
  trails, open items). Update both as work lands; keep the changelog header "Type:" summary current.
- `README.md`: download links/SHA256/version stay on the latest *released* version; unreleased work
  goes in "Current Development Focus" and "Known Limits".
- Release flow (only when asked): bump versions → full suite green → tag `vX.Y.Z` → `release.yml`
  builds/publishes → record SHA256 hashes → update README downloads + website → close issues
  earmarked "close on ship".

## Git & GitHub

- Commit directly to `main` in small, focused commits with descriptive messages referencing issues
  (e.g. `#212: declare the real zone count...`). Push after the suite is green.
- End commit messages with the attribution line required by the current session's system prompt
  (e.g. `Co-Authored-By: Claude ... <noreply@anthropic.com>`).
- Use `gh` for issues/PRs: `gh issue view N --comments`, `gh pr view N --comments`, `gh pr diff N`,
  `gh issue comment N --body-file file.md` (write long bodies to a scratch file first).
- Don't commit stray local files (e.g. untracked screenshots in `website/assets/`) unless asked.
- Reply tone on GitHub: friendly, concrete, transparent about uncertainty; ask for the specific
  artefact you need (diagnostics export, HardwareWorker.log, Guided Fan Verification export).

## Open threads (as of 2026-09-27 — verify on GitHub before acting)

- Field confirmation wanted: see "Needs Field Confirmation" in `docs/CHANGELOG_v4.4.1.md`.
- #211: quiet exits / NVML crash (awaiting HardwareWorker.log); fans-stay-high (awaiting exports).
- #213: occasional high temps at low load (awaiting export). PR #210: awaiting evidence for 8DD0.
- #149, #155, #184, #207: awaiting Guided Fan Verification exports. 8C58 curves off pending evidence.
- Discord GHOST (8BA9): keyboard colour not changing — needs an export after a colour apply.
- Close on 4.4.1 ship: #115, #172, #214, #215.
- Primax per-key: next step is an owner test, then an index map from our own source (Ohman is
  GPL-3 — use its documented facts only, never its code or key maps).

## Constraints

- No usage-billed Cloudflare products (Durable Objects, Browser Rendering) for the website or
  anything else without asking first — stay on free tier (static assets, KV, D1, plain Workers).
- Never touch real user hardware settings from tests; hardware is behind interfaces (`IHpWmiBios`,
  `IEcAccess`, `IMsrAccess`) — mock them.
