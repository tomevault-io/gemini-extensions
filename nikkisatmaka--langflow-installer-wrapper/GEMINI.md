## Design Constraints

- **No admin rights required** — everything installs under `%USERPROFILE%`
- **Idempotent** — safe to re-run; checks before acting
- **User-prompted** — script asks Install / Uninstall / Quit at startup
- **Credits banner** — GitHub + LinkedIn displayed on every run (Chris Titus style)
- **Version pinned** — Langflow `==1.11.3`; do not change without updating CONTRACT.md
- **Cross-platform** — Windows (PowerShell), macOS, and Linux (bash); platform-specific logic with shared installer flow
- **Python pinned** — 3.12 via `uv python install 3.12` (only version with pre-built wheels for all C-extensions on Windows; 3.13+ requires MSVC not available to most users)

## Key Design Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| `uv` over `pip` | Faster, self-bootstrapping, no pre-installed Python needed |
| `%USERPROFILE%\.local\bin` added to permanent PATH | uv installer puts binaries there; script ensures it persists |
| `WScript.Shell` COM for shortcut | Standard Windows method, no external deps |
| Desktop shortcut targets `uv run langflow run` | Works regardless of active venv state |
| Uninstall keeps `uv` | uv may be used for other projects |
| UTF-8 BOM required on `.ps1` | Windows PowerShell requires UTF-8 with BOM; without it, non-ASCII characters cause parser errors |
| `uv-install.ps1` fetched at package time | Eliminates `irm \| iex` pattern that heuristic AV triggers on; uses `$PSScriptRoot` to reference local file |
| Release zip structure | `Install Langflow.bat` and `LICENSE` at zip root; `install-langflow-script.ps1`, `uv-install.ps1`, and `constraints.txt` under `src/` — mirrors repo layout |
| Constraint applied by a relative, space-free name | Pins only known-breaking transitive deps instead of a full lock file. uv re-splits `--constraint`/`-c`/`--override`/`-r` values on whitespace (astral-sh/uv#12639), so a shell-quoted path with a space still truncates; installers copy `constraints.txt` into the langflow dir and pass `--constraint=constraints.txt`. See `docs/adr/0004-uv-constraint-space-free-path.md` |
| Consistent zip name for landing page | `langflow-installer-win.zip` uploaded alongside each versioned zip; landing page download link never needs updating |

## Conventions

- **PowerShell style**: Verb-Noun naming, `$true`/`$false`, `-ErrorAction Stop`, `Write-Host` for user output
- **Error handling**: try/catch with clear messages; non-fatal errors allow script to continue
- **Banner**: box-drawing characters with ANSI colors (if available), preserved as-is
- **Documentation**: markdown (this file and CONTRACT.md)
- **Bash style**: `set -euo pipefail`, `command -v` for existence checks, POSIX-friendly where feasible
- **Variable expansion**: Use `${VarName}` when the variable name boundary is ambiguous (i.e., the parser cannot tell where the variable name ends and surrounding text begins). For example, `$PythonVersion:` is misinterpreted as drive-qualified syntax in PowerShell; `${PythonVersion}:` resolves this. Automatic variables (`$_`, `$args`, `$PSScriptRoot`, `$HOME`, `$PATH`, `$?`, `$#`, etc.) are fine without braces.

## Security Rules

- Never hardcode API keys, tokens, or secrets
- Avoid `Invoke-Expression` on user-controlled or untrusted input
- The `irm ... | iex` pattern is **not used** — the uv bootstrapper is fetched from upstream at package time and invoked via `& "$PSScriptRoot\uv-install.ps1"`

## Commit Rules

- Use conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `chore:`
- **Atomic commits**: Each commit must represent one logical change. Do not bundle unrelated changes together.
- Reference CONTRACT.md sections when implementing requirements
- PR titles follow the same `<type>: <description>` format as commits

## Git Workflow

This project uses **GitHub Flow**:

- `main` — always deployable, reflects the latest released state
- Feature branches off `main` — short-lived, deleted after merge
- All changes land via Pull Request — no direct commits to `main`
- The agent may push feature branches and open (draft) PRs freely
- The user reviews, approves, and squash-merges the PR
- The agent must never push to `main` or create releases/tags without explicit instruction

## Branch Naming

Use semantic prefixes with kebab-case descriptions:

| Prefix | Purpose | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `feat/` | New feature or upgrade | `feat/upgrade-langflow-1-10-2` |
| `fix/` | Bug fix | `fix/utf8-bom-regression` |
| `docs/` | Documentation only | `docs/add-troubleshooting-section` |
| `refactor/` | Code restructuring | `refactor/extract-shortcut-logic` |
| `release/` | Release prep (version bump + changelog) | `release/v1.8.0` |
| `chore/` | Maintenance, tooling | `chore/update-verification-commands` |

Branch from `main`, open a PR, squash merge, delete branch. Keep branches short-lived (days, not weeks).

## Pull Request Workflow

1. Create a feature branch from `main` with a semantic name.
2. Make atomic commits with conventional commit messages.
3. Open a PR against `main`. Use a draft PR if the work is in progress.
4. PR title format: `<type>: <short description>` (e.g., `feat: upgrade Langflow to 1.11.3`).
5. PR description should explain **what** and **why**, not **how**.
6. Self-review the diff before marking the PR ready.
7. The user reviews, approves, and **squash merges** into `main` — this keeps main history linear and atomic.
8. Delete the feature branch after merge.
9. Update `CHANGELOG.md` as part of the PR (not a separate commit).

## Versioning

Use Semantic Versioning for releases.

| Change | Version bump |
| --- | --- |
| Bug fix, installer fix, dependency/lockfile update | Patch |
| New user-facing feature or supported capability | Minor |
| Breaking change to the installer, CLI, configuration, or supported environment | Major |
| Docs, tests, CI, refactoring with no release impact | No release |

Examples:

- `1.1.8 → 1.1.9` — bug fix or dependency update
- `1.1.8 → 1.2.0` — new user-facing feature
- `1.1.8 → 2.0.0` — breaking change

Commit prefixes (`fix:`, `feat:`, etc.) do not determine the version automatically. The release impact determines the version bump.

## Release Process

### Automated (CI/CD)

Tagging triggers the release workflow automatically:

1. Create a `release/vX.Y.Z` branch from `main`.
2. Update `$ScriptVersion` / `SCRIPT_VERSION` in the install scripts if they changed.
3. Update `CHANGELOG.md` with the new version, date, and entries.
4. Update `README.md` and `docs/index.html` if the hero message or version number changed.
5. Run `bash scripts/verify.sh` to confirm everything passes.
6. Commit with message: `docs: update changelog for vX.Y.Z`.
7. Push branch and open a draft PR against `main`.
8. User reviews, approves, and **squash merges** the PR.
9. After merge, push the tag from `main`: `git tag vX.Y.Z && git push origin vX.Y.Z`.
10. The CI workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`):
    - Runs verify checks
    - Runs the real installer scripts on the OS matrix (win-amd64, macos-arm64, linux-x64) with the pinned Langflow version and constraints
    - Confirms installed version matches the tag and script pin
    - Packages all 3 platform zips (both versioned and unversioned names)
    - Generates release notes from `CHANGELOG.md` via `scripts/release-notes.sh`
    - Creates a GitHub Release with grouped notes (Features, Bug Fixes, Documentation, Maintenance)
    - Uploads all 6 zips to the release
    - Tags containing `beta`, `rc`, or `alpha` are automatically marked as pre-release

**Do not delete and re-push the same tag name** — the CI workflow will create a new release or fail. If you need to fix a release, bump the version.

### Release Notes Standard

Release notes are auto-generated from `CHANGELOG.md` — it is the single source of truth for every release.

- Exactly one `## vX.Y.Z (YYYY-MM-DD)` heading per release.
- Each bullet must use conventional-commit format: `- type: description`.
- `scripts/release-notes.sh` groups bullets by type into headings:
  - `feat` -> **Features**
  - `fix` -> **Bug Fixes**
  - `docs` -> **Documentation**
  - `chore` / `refactor` -> **Maintenance**
- The notes body includes an **Installation** block (download table for Windows, macOS, Linux) and a **Full Changelog** comparison link.

### Zip contents

Each zip contains platform-specific files only:

**`langflow-installer-win.zip` / `langflow-installer-vX.Y.Z.zip`:**
- `Install Langflow.bat` (root)
- `Stop Langflow.bat` (root)
- `LICENSE` (root)
- `src/install-langflow-script.ps1`
- `src/stop-langflow-script.ps1`
- `src/uv-install.ps1` (fetched from upstream at package time)
- `src/constraints.txt`

**`langflow-installer-macos.zip`:**
- `Install Langflow.command` (root)
- `Stop Langflow.command` (root)
- `LICENSE` (root)
- `src/install-langflow.sh`
- `src/stop-langflow.sh`
- `src/constraints.txt`

**`langflow-installer-linux.zip`:**
- `Install Langflow.sh` (root)
- `Stop Langflow.sh` (root)
- `LICENSE` (root)
- `src/install-langflow.sh`
- `src/stop-langflow.sh`
- `src/constraints.txt`

Landing page download URLs (never changes across versions):
- Windows: `https://github.com/NikkiSatmaka/langflow-installer-wrapper/releases/latest/download/langflow-installer-win.zip`
- macOS: `https://github.com/NikkiSatmaka/langflow-installer-wrapper/releases/latest/download/langflow-installer-macos.zip`
- Linux: `https://github.com/NikkiSatmaka/langflow-installer-wrapper/releases/latest/download/langflow-installer-linux.zip`

## How to Bump Langflow Version

Update files in this order:

1. **Single source of truth**: change `$LangflowVersion` in `src/install-langflow-script.ps1`.
   - Update `LANGFLOW_VERSION` in `src/install-langflow.sh` to match.
2. Update `src/constraints.txt` if any known-breaking transitive deps need new version bounds for the new Langflow version.
3. Update plain-text references in these files to match:
   - `README.md` (hero line + what-it-does list)
   - `CONTRACT.md` (purpose + install step)
   - `AGENTS.md` (project overview + design constraints)
   - `docs/index.html` (hero + what-it-does list)
4. Run verification checks to confirm all references are consistent.
5. If the new Langflow version has pre-built wheels for Python 3.12, no Python version change needed. Otherwise reassess the Python pin in `CONTRACT.md` section 6.

## Smoke Testing

Smoke tests are automated via CI (weekly schedule + tag triggers). Before releasing, also manually verify:

- Run the script in a Windows VM or clean environment (no pre-installed Python).
- Test all 3 menu paths: Install, Uninstall, Quit.
- Confirm Install is idempotent (re-running detects existing components).
- Confirm the desktop shortcut launches Langflow and the browser opens.
- Confirm `uv pip install "langflow==X.Y.Z" --constraint=src/constraints.txt` succeeds on the pinned Python 3.12.
- Confirm Uninstall removes `%USERPROFILE%\langflow\` and the shortcut, and optionally Python 3.12.

## Assets

- `src/assets/langflow.png` and `src/assets/langflow.ico` are the desktop shortcut icons, sourced from [dashboard-icons](https://github.com/homarr-labs/dashboard-icons) by homarr-labs (MIT license). The `.ico` is generated from the `.png` via ImageMagick. Windows uses the `.ico`; Linux uses the `.png` via the `.desktop` `Icon=` field. macOS keeps the default `.command` icon by design.

## Skills

These existing skills are useful for this project. Load them via the `skill()` tool when the task matches:

| Skill | When to use |
|-------|-------------|
| `code-review` | Before merging a PR — reviews changes against AGENTS.md conventions and CONTRACT.md spec |
| `research` | Investigating platform porting (macOS/Linux), Langflow dependency changes, or uv behaviour |
| `implement` | Building the macOS/Linux installer port |
| `diagnosing-bugs` | Investigating user-reported issues, AV false positives, or runtime failures |

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues live in GitHub Issues. Use the `gh` CLI. External PRs are not a triage surface. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

Default vocabulary: `needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, `wontfix`. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context repo. One `CONTEXT.md` at root, ADRs in `docs/adr/`. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.

## Verification

Before committing (or before merging a PR), run `bash scripts/verify.sh` — it checks all the following automatically:

- **Braces balanced**: confirm `{` and `}` counts match in the PowerShell script (AVOID: `irm | iex` injection via unbalanced blocks)
- **No irm | iex**: the pattern must not exist in `src/install-langflow-script.ps1`
- **Docs up to date**: AGENTS.md and CONTRACT.md reflect any behavior changes
- **No secrets or absolute paths** in the diff
- **Consistent zip uploaded**: confirm `langflow-installer-win.zip` is attached to the release alongside the versioned zip
- **Encoding correct**: batch files use ASCII; .ps1 files are UTF-8 with BOM
- **Version consistency**: all files reference the same `$LangflowVersion`
- **No stale version refs**: after bumping, confirm no outdated version strings remain (CHANGELOG history excluded)
- **Bash script**: has `set -euo pipefail` and POSIX-friendly syntax
- **constraints.txt exists**: the constraints file must be present alongside installer scripts
- **Lint**: `mise run lint` (shellcheck + shfmt + PSScriptAnalyzer) passes

`mise` is a required contributor prerequisite. `scripts/verify.sh` runs `mise run lint` as check 12 and fails if mise is not installed. Install it with `mise install` (reads `mise.toml`), then run `mise run lint` locally or `mise run fmt` to reformat bash scripts in place. The lint gate is enforced in CI via `jdx/mise-action@v2` on every PR to `main`.

Lint config rationale:

- `.shellcheckrc` disables `SC2059` because the installer intentionally embeds ANSI colour variables in `printf` format strings for banners.
- `PSScriptAnalyzerSettings.psd1` excludes `PSAvoidUsingWriteHost`, `PSUseShouldProcessForStateChangingFunctions`, and `PSAvoidUsingEmptyCatchBlock` — these conflict with the documented conventions (Write-Host output, try/catch-continue error handling).

The CI workflow (`.github/workflows/verify.yml`) runs `scripts/verify.sh` on every PR to `main`.

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.
