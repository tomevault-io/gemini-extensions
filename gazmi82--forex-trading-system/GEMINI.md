> A multi-agent AI forex trading system using Claude API as the intelligence layer

# CLAUDE.md — Forex Trading System Project Context
# This file is for Claude Code (VS Code) to stay aligned with all decisions,
# architecture, and progress made in the main Claude.ai chat session.
# Last updated: March 28, 2026

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

A multi-agent AI forex trading system using Claude API as the intelligence layer
with rule-based Python execution. Currently in 12-month demo phase.

**Owner:** Gazmir Sulcaj (gsulcaj22@gmail.com)
**Start Date:** March 10, 2026
**Demo Period:** 12 months (ends March 10, 2027)
**Live Trading:** Not before March 2027

---

## LOCKED DECISIONS — DO NOT CHANGE

These decisions were made in the main session and are final:

| Decision | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Focus pair | EUR/USD ONLY |
| Broker | OANDA (demo) → IBKR for futures later |
| Starting capital | $5,000 (when live) |
| Demo capital | $100,000 OANDA V20 demo account ✅ ACTIVE |
| OANDA Account ID | 101-001-38764497-001 |
| Agent approach | Option 1 (System Prompt) + Option 2 (RAG) combined |
| Embedding model | all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (local, FREE) |
| Vector DB | ChromaDB (local, FREE) |
| Demo mode flag | Always TRUE until March 2027 |

---

## HARD TRADING RULES — NEVER MODIFY

These rules are embedded in the system prompt and must NEVER be changed:

```
1. Max risk per trade:     1% of account equity
2. Min Risk:Reward ratio:  1:2 (2.0)
3. Daily loss limit:       2% — triggers auto-stop of all trading
4. Confidence threshold:   <65% = NEUTRAL signal always (no trade)
5. News blackout:          30 min before NFP, CPI, FOMC, ECB decisions
6. Kill Zones only:        London (3-4 AM EST) + NY (8-10 AM EST)
7. Demo mode:              TRUE (hardcoded) until month 12
```

## ENVIRONMENT SETUP

```bash
# Navigate to project
cd ~/forex_trading_system

# Activate virtual environment (ALWAYS do this first)
source venv/bin/activate

# Required
# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
# OANDA_API_KEY
# OANDA_ACCOUNT_ID=101-001-38764497-001

# Optional live fundamentals
# FINNHUB_API_KEY
# NEWS_API_KEY
```

Fundamentals status:
- DXY is auto-fetched intraday from Yahoo Finance
- COT is auto-fetched from CFTC.gov, but remains weekly macro data
- Forex Factory provides the next high-impact USD / EUR event
- Calendar refresh is fixed to 6-hour UTC slots; cached upcoming events roll forward locally between slot refreshes
- Finnhub or NewsAPI provide the latest FX headline when configured
- USD target range is fetched from the official Fed open-market page and ECB key rates are fetched from the official ECB key-rates page
- ECB main refi, marginal lending, and deposit rates are exposed; deposit remains the EUR benchmark for the rate differential
- Retail sentiment auto-fetches from the OANDA EUR/USD position book when available
- Historical replay can load local Fed/ECB rates, DXY, EUR COT, and high-impact USD/EUR calendar CSVs from `backtest_data/fundamentals/`
- Closed trades now generate both:
  - structured feedback stored directly into the feedback RAG collection
  - readable markdown review notes in `feedback/`

## EUR/USD SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE EMBEDDED IN AGENT

The following concepts are in the system prompt (Option 1):

```
Sessions & Kill Zones:
  - Asian: 8PM-4AM EST — builds range, observe only
  - London Kill Zone: 3AM-4AM EST — sweeps Asian high/low, prime entry
  - NY Kill Zone: 8AM-10AM EST — continuation or reversal

Key Drivers of EUR/USD:
  1. Fed vs ECB interest rate differential
  2. DXY direction (inverse correlation — EUR is 57.6% of DXY)
  3. Economic data surprises (NFP, CPI, PMI, IFO)
  4. Risk sentiment (S&P500 as proxy)
  5. COT positioning (CFTC Commitments of Traders)

ICT Concepts Applied:
  - Order Blocks (OB) — institutional entry zones
  - Fair Value Gaps (FVG) — price imbalances to fill
  - Liquidity sweeps — stop hunts before real moves
  - Premium/Discount — only buy in discount, sell in premium
  - OTE (Optimal Trade Entry) — 62-79% Fibonacci retracement

Key Weekly Levels to Always Track:
  - Previous Week High (PWH) + Previous Week Low (PWL)
  - Previous Day High (PDH) + Previous Day Low (PDL)
  - Round numbers: 1.0500, 1.0600, 1.0700, 1.0800, 1.0900, 1.1000
  - Current week/day open price
```

## OANDA CONNECTOR (March 11, 2026) ✅ ACTIVE

OANDA demo account successfully created and set as the primary broker.

**Account Status:** LIVE DEMO ✅
- Account ID: `101-001-38764497-001`
- Account Type: V20 (OANDA's modern REST API)
- Balance: $100,000.00 USD
- NAV: $100,000.00
- Unrealized P/L: $0.00
- Activated: March 11, 2026

**Connector file:** `app/brokers/oanda.py`

**What it does:**
- Fetches real-time EUR/USD bid/ask/mid/spread
- Downloads OHLCV candles for 4H, 1H, Daily, Weekly timeframes
- Calculates all indicators (EMA, RSI, ADX, ATR) from real data
- Detects ICT concepts (Order Blocks, FVGs, P/D zones, liquidity sweeps)
- Identifies market structure from confirmed swing pivots across all timeframes
- Uses ATR-based tolerance to avoid treating tiny wick differences as new structure
- Keeps the same public `weekly_structure` / `*_trend` fields used by the API and frontend
- Reads account balance, equity, open positions from OANDA
- Fails closed when live broker data is unavailable

**Live fundamentals layered on top:**
- DXY intraday signal from Yahoo Finance (`DX-Y.NYB`)
- next high-impact USD / EUR event from Forex Factory
- latest FX headline from Finnhub or NewsAPI when configured
- COT positioning from CFTC.gov for delayed weekly macro bias
- retail sentiment is sourced only from the OANDA EUR/USD position book

**Auth:** Bearer token — OANDA API key in Authorization header

**Instrument name:** `EUR_USD` (OANDA format, not `EURUSD`)

**To activate:**
```bash
# 1. OANDA demo account created ✅ (March 11, 2026)
# 2. Generate API key: My Account → Manage API Access → Generate
# 3. Set in terminal (add to ~/.zshrc for persistence):
export OANDA_API_KEY="your-api-key"
export OANDA_ACCOUNT_ID="101-001-38764497-001"

# 4. Test connection:
python main.py --mode test

# 5. Run live demo:
python main.py --mode demo
```

**Failure behavior:** If OANDA credentials are not set or live market data fails,
the system stops and prints actionable warnings. It does not substitute static data.

---

## NEXT STEPS (Priority Order)

See `IMPROVEMENT_ROADMAP.md` for the full implementation history. Current
state summary below.

```
COMPLETED (March 2026):
  ✅ Build OANDA broker layer and demo runtime
  ✅ Mechanical confluence scorer + execution gate
  ✅ Weekly loss limit enforcement
  ✅ Historical data loader, replay engine, outcome simulator, and reports
  ✅ Historical fundamentals provider with local rates / DXY / COT / calendar CSVs
  ✅ Structured trade feedback + per-trade timeline logging
  ✅ TP1 partial close from config
  ✅ ATR-based trailing stop after TP1
  ✅ First-hour early momentum exit for stalled trades

CURRENT PRIORITIES:
  ⬜ Improve replay realism further
     → sequential one-account simulation
     → spread / slippage modeling
  ⬜ Continue hardening live fundamentals infrastructure
  ⬜ Add more ICT transcripts and remaining research PDFs
  ⬜ Build a cleaner performance dashboard on top of existing API/log outputs
```

## CLAUDE CODE INSTRUCTIONS

When working on this project in VS Code, follow these rules:

1. **Never change hard risk rules** — 1% max, 1:2 RR, 2% daily limit are sacred
2. **Never set demo_mode = False** — only change after March 2027
3. **Always test with --mode test before --mode demo**
4. **All new features must fail closed on missing live data** — print actionable warnings, never use example market data
5. **Never delete logs/** — every signal is training data
6. **Never delete chroma_db/** — rebuilding takes 30+ minutes
7. **Always activate venv first** — `source venv/bin/activate`
8. **Config changes go in app/core/config.py only** — not hardcoded in other files
9. **New documents go in documents/[category]/** then run --mode ingest
10. **Keep the OANDA broker layer separate** — never merge `app/brokers/oanda.py` into the CLI entrypoint
11. **New features must follow IMPROVEMENT_ROADMAP.md phase order** — do not skip phases; each builds on the last
12. **Allowed sessions are defined once** — always import `ALLOWED_ENTRY_SESSIONS` from `app/analysis/scheduler.py`, never hardcode the set
13. **Confluence scoring** — when the mechanical scorer (Phase 1) is built, it becomes the execution gate; Claude's self-reported score is logged only for comparison
