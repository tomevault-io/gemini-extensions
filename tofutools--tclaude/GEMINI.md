# tclaude agent instructions

`AGENTS.md` is a symlink to this file. Keep this file short, durable, and
useful as startup context for coding agents. Do not use it as a changelog,
implementation diary, roadmap, or project-management scratchpad.

## What tclaude is

`tclaude` is a Go CLI that wraps agentic coding harnesses in tmux and adds
session management, conversation search, usage/status reporting, worktree
helpers, and multi-agent coordination.

The project is harness-agnostic. Four harnesses are registered via
`--harness claude|codex|opencode|copilot` (Claude Code is the default); the
selected harness is persisted per conversation. The harness seam lives in
`pkg/claude/harness`.

Many identifiers still contain historical `Claude`/`claude`/`TCLAUDE_` names
even when the code is now harness-agnostic. Treat those names as historical,
not Claude-Code-only. Do not opportunistically mass-rename them; only rename at
a clean, contained rewrite point.

## Build and test

Common commands:

```bash
go build ./...
go test ./...
go test ./pkg/claude/conv/...
golangci-lint run ./...
go install . ./cmd/...
```

The repo builds two binaries: a bare `go install .` gets you only `tclaude`,
while `. ./cmd/...` adds the standalone `tclaude-agentd` daemon. See
`CONTRIBUTING.md` for why not `./...`.

CI runs `go test ./...` and `golangci-lint run ./...`. Do make sure your changes at 
least build, and run focused local tests when they help your own iteration on the code 
you are changing.

Platform target: Linux and macOS. WSL is treated as Linux for practical use.
Native Windows is not a supported development target; do not design new
features around native Windows behavior unless the operator explicitly asks.

## Where to look

- Entry points: `main.go` (the `tclaude` CLI, via `pkg/claude.Cmd()`) and
  `cmd/tclaude-agentd/main.go` (the standalone daemon, via
  `agentd.RootCmd()`). Both go through `pkg/claude/cli`, which owns the
  process-level entry sequence and the shared root-command wiring — put
  anything both binaries need there rather than duplicating it.
- Root command wiring: `pkg/claude/claude.go`.
- Harness design and capability matrix: `docs/harnesses.md`.
- Adding another harness: `docs/adding-a-harness.md`.
- Agent coordination: `docs/agents-and-groups.md` and
  `docs/spawning-and-lifecycle.md`.
- Dashboard: `docs/dashboard.md`.
- Sessions, conversations, worktrees, tasks, status bar, notifications:
  corresponding files under `docs/`.
- Flow-test helpers and simulators: `pkg/testharness/`.
- Contributing and flow-test style: `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

Avoid maintaining exhaustive package inventories here. They drift quickly; use
the code tree and focused docs as the source of truth.

## Architecture guardrails

- Commands use Cobra through Boa (`boa.CmdT[...]`) with
  `common.DefaultParamEnricher()` unless nearby code establishes another
  pattern.
- Session and conversation state lives in SQLite under
  `~/.tclaude/data/db.sqlite`. The sibling `~/.tclaude/api/` tree is reserved
  for the agent-reachable daemon socket; private daemon state stays under
  `~/.tclaude/data/`.
  Legacy JSON files may still be written for compatibility, but SQLite is the
  source of truth for tclaude.
- Harness support is capability-based. Callers should gate behavior on the
  harness descriptor (`Supports*` / `Can*`) and degrade gracefully when a
  contract is absent.
- In-pane slash-command delivery via tmux `send-keys` is an injection sink.
  Lifecycle command tokens must be compile-time constants from the harness
  lifecycle, never interpolated user input. User-controlled titles or text sent
  toward these paths must pass the existing charset/length gates.
- Platform-specific code should use Go build tags such as `_linux.go`,
  `_darwin.go`, and `_unix.go`. Treat old `_windows.go` files as vestigial
  unless the task explicitly concerns them.

## Testing guidance

Unit tests live next to the code they cover. Flow tests live under
`pkg/claude/agentd/*_flow_test.go` and run under plain `go test ./...`.

Flow tests exercise production paths through the daemon HTTP mux. Only the
external subprocess boundaries are swapped:

- `clcommon.Default` for tmux.
- `agentd.Spawn` for `tclaude session new`.
- `agentd.runPluginShell` for plugin shell execution when needed.
- `session.SetCodexEffectiveConfigProbeForTest` for the `codex app-server`
  effective-config read that resolves a filtered Codex launch's provider route.
  `agentd`'s `TestMain` installs a binary-wide default, so only tests needing a
  specific provider route swap their own.

Keep new tests focused on user-visible surfaces such as CLI/API results,
conversation listings, and dashboard snapshots. Avoid asserting on simulator
internals when a production read path can be exercised instead.

For manual dashboard visual smoke, first check that Linux-side Chrome/Chromium
exists, then run:

```bash
TCLAUDE_DASHSNAP=1 TCLAUDE_DASHSNAP_SHARD=1/4 go test ./pkg/claude/agentd/ -run TestDashSnap -v -count=1 -timeout 600s
```

Run shards `1/4` through `4/4` to cover the full matrix (each takes a few
minutes; an unsharded full run needs `-timeout 1800s`). See "Visual smoke
testing" in `docs/dashboard.md`.

The visual smoke harness is optional and environment-dependent; it is not wired
into CI.

## UI design proposals: mock, render, notify

For UI direction questions — which control type fits, competing layout ideas, a
contested visual change — do not iterate in the production frontend. The full
dev loop (edit real JS/CSS, rebuild, re-render, review) is far slower than the
decision needs. Instead:

1. Write a small standalone HTML+CSS file that mocks the alternatives side by
   side, approximating the dashboard theme. No build step, no app assets.
2. Render it with the host's Chrome:
   `google-chrome --headless=new --no-sandbox --screenshot=out.png
   --window-size=WxH --hide-scrollbars file:///path/to/mock.html`.
   Under an agent sandbox, point `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, `XDG_CACHE_HOME`, and
   `XDG_DATA_HOME` at a disposable writable directory first — Chrome's crashpad
   ignores `--user-data-dir` and aborts when `~/.config` is unwritable (same
   trick as `pkg/claude/agentd/dashsnap`).
3. Send the rendered image to the operator with
   `tclaude agent notify-human -a out.png` plus a short assessment and a
   recommendation, and let the human pick. Note that notify-human is
   permission-gated (`human.notify` slug or group ownership); an agent without
   the grant should route the image through its coordinating agent or fall
   back to `--ask-human`.
4. Only after a direction is chosen, ticket and implement it in the real
   frontend.

This keeps taste decisions with the human at the cost of minutes, and avoids
churning production code on designs that may be rejected.

The same loop works agent-to-agent. A lead can ask the implementing agent for
a mock before green-lighting implementation, or send the implementor a
rendered mock of what is wanted; either side re-renders and replies with an
updated image, passing an absolute path the peer can read in the message body
(`tclaude agent send` carries text only — attachments exist only on
notify-human), iterating on the design together before any production code is
written. Bring the human in with notify-human whenever a decision is taste 
rather than mechanics.

## Git, commits, and PRs

When making feature or fix changes as an agent, create a feature branch unless the 
operator gives different instructions. It is fine to force-push a feature branch; 
never force-push `main`.

Do not include remote-access/session links in commits, PR descriptions, or PR
comments. In particular, do not add `Claude-Session:` trailers or
`https://claude.ai/code/...` URLs. A plain `Co-Authored-By` trailer is fine.

PR descriptions should start with a short `Background / Purpose` section that
explains why the PR exists. Then summarize the implementation and list tests or
verification.

Every PR needs a real cold review, but make a commit to the feature branch first.
CodeRabbit is enough for small/routine PRs only when it produced actual review
feedback; a green CodeRabbit check that skipped because of quota is not a
review. Larger, riskier, or more judgment-heavy PRs should get an independent
fresh-agent review even if CodeRabbit commented.

An independent review must be done by a fresh agent: one uninvolved in the
work, seeing the diff cold — cold means no exposure to how the change was
built, not context-free. Give it the diff, a review instruction, and the PR
description's Background / Purpose section (the same one every PR must open
with, which is where settled operator decisions and the larger refactor a PR
belongs to are recorded). That context is what keeps a partial or incremental
step from being mistaken for reintroducing old limitations or bugs, and keeps
review effort on defects rather than relitigating direction. What stays out is
the implementation journey: what was tried, and the implementer's own
justifications beyond what Background / Purpose already states. Triage its
findings like CodeRabbit's: fix valid issues and document any deliberate
skips. Record the review status in the PR description or a PR comment,
including who reviewed and any important follow-up.

How you obtain that fresh agent is deliberately not fixed. `tclaude agent
spawn` is the preferred mechanism, because the reviewer becomes a real peer
the operator can see and talk to. It is not the only one: when spawn
permission is unavailable, an in-harness subagent of the local harness
(Claude Code's Task tool, Codex CLI's equivalent) is a valid fallback, as is
asking the operator to arrange a reviewer. What must hold is the cold and
uninvolved property described above, not the spawn path. Say which mechanism
you used when you record the review status, so a subagent review is not
mistaken for a peer-agent one.

Do not `git add -A`; stage specific paths.

## Work tracking

The external tracker and private board details are not stored in this repo. Use
operator-provided startup context or private project memory when it is available,
and do not add private tracker URLs or credentials to committed docs.

Design intent, plans, and roadmaps live in the external tracker, not in this
repo — do not commit plan or roadmap documents. The repo carries code, the user
docs under `docs/`, and inline rationale in code comments.

The one exception is `docs/v2-plan-and-ideas/`: preliminary v2 model and
architecture designs (WIP), not guidance for regular work, improvements, or features.
