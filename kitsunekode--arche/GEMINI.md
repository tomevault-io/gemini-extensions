# Agent guide (canonical)

Read this file first, then the **nearest** local `AGENTS.md` for the workspace you are editing. Use [docs/README.md](docs/README.md) for user-facing commands and [`.docs/README.md`](.docs/README.md) for internal architecture/context. Load one matching [`.plans/active/`](.plans/active/) file only for approved in-flight work. Production deploy: [docs/deployment.md](docs/deployment.md) and [docs/deployment-env.md](docs/deployment-env.md).

## Core priorities

**Performance first.** **Reliability first.** Keep behavior predictable under load and during failures (session restarts, reconnects, partial streams).

If a tradeoff is required, choose **correctness and robustness** over short-term convenience.

**Maintainability:** Before adding functionality, check whether shared logic belongs in a dedicated module. Duplicate logic across files is a code smell. Do not take shortcuts with one-off local hacks—refactor existing code when it improves the system.

## How to navigate

1. Nearest `AGENTS.md` (app or package you touch).
2. [docs/README.md](docs/README.md) — public/manual documentation.
3. [`.docs/README.md`](.docs/README.md) and one task-specific internal topic when implementing.
4. One matching [`.plans/active/`](.plans/active/) plan when executing approved work.

Run `bun run repo:doctor` before release or after large cleanup passes.

## Before push (required)

**Do not push until the minimum ladder passes** — including production **build**. On `main`, `prod`, or `develop`, run the full CI ladder instead.

GitHub Actions [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml) runs the full ladder; failed pushes block the branch and waste review time.

### Minimum ladder (every push)

From the repo root:

```bash
bun run ci:min
```

That runs, in order: `format:check` → `turbo lint check-types` (all packages) → `bun test` → `turbo build` (all packages, including `apps/web` MDX generate + Next build).

On feature branches when the merge base is correct, the faster variant is fine:

```bash
bun run ci:min:affected
```

Run the same steps manually if you prefer:

| Step | Command                           | What it catches                                           |
| ---- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | `bun run format:check`            | Oxfmt (use `bun run format` to fix)                       |
| 2    | `bunx turbo run lint check-types` | Oxlint + `tsc --noEmit` in every package with those tasks |
| 3    | `bun test`                        | All Bun tests (web, cli, packages, …)                     |
| 4    | `bunx turbo run build`            | Production builds — **required before push**              |

Pre-commit hooks run **lint-staged** (format + oxlint on staged files) and **gitleaks** on staged paths. They do **not** replace typecheck, test, or build.

### Full CI (protected branches and pre-review)

From the repo root:

```bash
bun run ci
```

Adds `pkg:check` and `repo:doctor:strict` on top of the minimum ladder.

On **push to `main` or `prod`**, CI does **not** use Turbo `--affected` — it typechecks and lints the **entire monorepo**. A change that only typechecks `apps/web` locally can still fail on `packages/registry`, `apps/cli`, etc. Always run full `bun run ci` before pushing to those branches.

For **feature branches / pull requests**, CI may use `--affected`, but full `bun run ci` is still safer before you ask for review:

```bash
bun run ci:affected
```

### Workspace-specific notes

- **`apps/web`:** After editing `content/docs/**` or `content/blog/**`, run `bun run --cwd apps/web mdx:generate` if `check-types` complains about `.source/`. Web tests: `bun test apps/web`.
- **`apps/cli`:** Covered by `pkg:check`; also `bun test apps/cli/tests` when touching CLI only.
- **`packages/*`:** Any new package dependency (e.g. web importing `@arche-template/registry`) must pass that package’s `check-types` in the full turbo graph.

### When to run doctor

- Before push to protected branches: included in `bun run ci`.
- After large cleanup, renames, or doc moves: `bun run repo:doctor` (warnings OK locally); use `repo:doctor:strict` before merge.

Prefer `AGENTS.md` over package `README.md` files for agent context. When behavior or commands change, update the nearest `AGENTS.md` and the owning public `docs/` or internal `.docs/` topic. Never treat `.plans/archive/` as current behavior.

## Stack map

| Workspace                 | Role                                                                           |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `apps/web`                | Next.js App Router; tRPC client + `trpcCaller` for RSC                         |
| `apps/server`             | Express, Better Auth, module-first features (`src/modules/*`)                  |
| `apps/worker`             | Background jobs (Redis/BullMQ when enabled)                                    |
| `packages/trpc`           | **Client contract only** — re-exports `AppRouter` / `createCaller` from server |
| `packages/store`          | Prisma schema and client                                                       |
| `packages/auth`           | Better Auth server + client                                                    |
| `packages/backend-common` | `serverEnv`, app Redis (`redis`), BullMQ (`ioredis`), logging, `validate-env`  |

tRPC procedures live in `apps/server/src/modules/<feature>/*.trpc.ts`, composed in `apps/server/src/modules/trpc/app.router.ts`.

## Production default (KitsuneKode)

**Vercel web + Render Docker API + Neon + Upstash.** Ops checklist: [docs/production-playbook.md](docs/production-playbook.md). Do not copy the env matrix here — use [docs/deployment-env.md](docs/deployment-env.md).

## Deploy (production)

Hub: [docs/deployment.md](docs/deployment.md). Env matrix: [docs/deployment-env.md](docs/deployment-env.md).

- **Path A:** `apps/web` + `apps/server` on Vercel — [docs/deployment-vercel.md](docs/deployment-vercel.md) (`vercel-handler`, external `DATABASE_URL` / `REDIS_URL`).
- **Path B:** `apps/web` on Vercel, `apps/server` on Render Docker — [docs/deployment-render.md](docs/deployment-render.md) ([render.yaml](render.yaml), Neon + Upstash).
- **Path C:** `apps/web` on Vercel, `apps/server` on Railway Docker — [docs/deployment-railway.md](docs/deployment-railway.md) ([railway.toml](railway.toml), Neon + Upstash).

Postgres and Redis are always URL-based on the API host (Neon + Upstash recommended). Do not use Render Postgres/Key Value. `ENABLE_REDIS=false` for API-only (no `/admin/queues`, no worker).

## Commands

See [docs/commands.md](docs/commands.md). Common: `bun dev`, `bun run build`, `bun run db:migrate`, `bun test`. **Pre-push:** `bun run ci:min` minimum; `bun run ci` on protected branches (see [Before push (required)](#before-push-required)).

## Do not load by default

Historical planning and assessment docs live under [docs/archive/planning/](docs/archive/planning/). They are not implementation sources.

## Portfolio / CLI

Scaffold CLI: [apps/cli/CLI-SPEC.md](apps/cli/CLI-SPEC.md). Fullstack scaffolds may include `SHOWCASE.mdx` for portfolio sync (`kitsunekode.in`).

Web/brand work: read [PRODUCT.md](PRODUCT.md) and [`.docs/product/web-brand-ui-brief.md`](.docs/product/web-brand-ui-brief.md) before editing public site copy or visual direction.
