## Code Like Ben (Voxels)

- **Don't think, just do**: This is a gross old code base written by people that made lots of dumb decisions, don't try and fix them unless the user explicitly asks you to.
- **Act locally, don't think**: No "discovery" or "architecture." If you see the fix, execute it now.
- **Path of least resistance**: Fix type errors with `any`. Use `// todo` for anything you can't fix immediately.
- **Zero duplication**: Never repeat code. Move shared logic to `utils.ts`.
- **Edit, don't rewrite**: Provide surgical diffs. Never resupply whole files.
- **One-and-done reading**: Do not re-read files you have already accessed.
- **ASCII only**: No em-dashes, smart quotes, or Unicode. Use standard hyphens and straight quotes.
- **No fluff**: No "I understand" or "Certainly." No opening or closing sycophancy.
- **Be direct**: Concise responses, thorough reasoning, simple solutions. No over-engineering.
- **Stay grounded**: If unsure, say so. Never invent file paths or function names.
- **User is truth**: If corrected, treat it as ground truth. User instructions always override this file.

## Committing

* run `pnpm run precommit`and fix the errors before committing.

## Public API changes

If you add, remove or change the behaviour of any route described in
`server/openapi.yaml`, update it in the same PR. Not a follow-up, the same PR.
That file covers the public reads today and is where writes go when they are
documented, so the rule follows the file, not the verb.

`server/test/openapi-routes-test.ts` hard fails when the yaml documents a route
that no longer exists, and warns when a route is missing from it. The hard half
is deliberate: docs that lie are worse than docs with gaps. A renamed or deleted
route without a yaml change is a lie, and it ships to everyone reading the api
page, `llms.txt` or the spec.

The page and `llms.txt` are generated, so run `npm run docs:api` after editing
the yaml and commit what it writes.

## CI

`.github/workflows/check.yml` runs tsc and prettier on every PR. Before adding
anything to it:

1. it must not slow down development
2. it must be insanely fast, 60 seconds or less
3. it must not be subjective (no code complexity analysis)
4. bonus: it must speed up the workflow for all devs and reviewers

Measure the job before you propose it. Anything that makes CI slower may get
backed out.

## UI and "zinestyle" naming things

* direct over fluffy
* human language, not jargon
* specificity instead of abstraction
* warmth and personality
* lean into constraint
* zine/diy energy—intimate and community-focused
* no corporate hedging
* write like you're talking to someone, not a demographic
* lower case for subheadings

If you want your PR merged: **code like Ben**.

This is not “best practices”. This is **ship practices**.

## Ben principles (non‑negotiables)

- **Fix the problem, not the worldview**: one PR = one problem. No “architecture journey”.
- **Surgical diffs**: minimum lines, maximum impact. If it’s noisy, it’s wrong.
- **Delete first**: dead/confusing/duplicated/unused code gets removed. Don’t museum it.
- **Runtime reality wins**: browsers lie, APIs break, users do dumb stuff. Guard it and move on.
- **Fail soft**: prefer “do nothing / return / fallback” over crashing the app for edge cases.
- **Deterministic beats clever**: if detection is flaky, hardcode the sane value and ship it.
- **No ceremony**: fewer layers, fewer abstractions, fewer files, fewer “patterns”.
- **Stop allocating in hot paths**: cache/freeze singletons where it matters.
- **Logs aren’t a lifestyle**: remove spam. Keep only high-signal logs that explain real state.
- **Comments justify constraints**: comment only when there’s a real constraint or weirdness.
- **Name things like a human**: plain names, not corporate nouns. `frames`, `pageHtml`, `iDoc`.
- **Be direct**: commit messages and PR descriptions can be blunt. No marketing. No TED talk.

## The “No Resurrection” rule (maintenance reality)

Voxels is being open-sourced so it can live, **not** so it can be bloated.

- **No feature bloat**: Do not “add” things. If it wasn’t in the core feature set of the final production version, I don’t want it.
- **The UI stays as‑is**: I spent years fighting UI churn. I do not care if you liked the 2021 menu better. I am the one who has to support this code; I want 1/10th of the code for the same features. If you want a different UI, maintain a branch.
- **Dead means dead**: Do not try to bring back “classic” features or “better” old versions of systems that were stripped out. They were stripped for a reason (usually because they were buggy, heavy, or broken).
- **Minimalist stewardship**: This repo is a finished product, not a canvas for your “best possible version” ideas. PRs that add complexity or revert to old, heavy patterns will be closed without debate.

## What Ben-style PRs look like

- **Small surface area**
  - Touch the fewest files you can.
  - Avoid drive-by formatting and lint churn.
- **Clear causality**
  - Every line changed should have a reason you can say in one sentence.
- **Dead code removal is a feature**
  - If a feature/module is unused or making the code harder to reason about, delete it.
- **Guard rails, not dissertations**
  - Add `try/catch`, `if (!x) return`, and explicit fallbacks where real-world input breaks.
- **Can it be done in less lines of code**
  - If your new code adds 10 lines when the same thing could be achieved with a single line of code, it will not be merged.

## Client-side data fetching

Web pages use `cachedFetch` from `web/src/helpers/cached-fetch.ts` instead of raw `fetch`. It caches responses in memory (default 60s TTL) so navigating back to a page doesn't re-hit the server.

If you save/mutate data and then `route()` back to the view page, call `invalidateUrl` first or the user will see stale data:

```ts
import { invalidateUrl } from './helpers/cached-fetch'

// drop from cache, next visit re-fetches from server:
invalidateUrl(`/api/parcels/${id}.json`)
route(`/parcels/${id}`)

// drop and immediately re-fetch (bypasses network cache via cache: 'reload'):
await invalidateUrl(`/api/parcels/${id}.json`, true)
```

Pass `true` as the second arg to also immediately re-fetch so the next render is instant and warm. `invalidateUrl` also accepts a wildcard prefix (`/api/parcels/123/*`) to nuke all related cache keys at once.

## Ben fix patterns (copy/paste mentality)

### Guard against `undefined` / garbage input

- If state might be missing: **don’t write `undefined` into the DOM**. Guard it.
- If JSON might be bad: `try/catch` and bail (and remember TS `catch` is `unknown`).

### Flaky browser API? Wrap it and continue

- Audio decode, media source nodes, iframe docs, weird Safari stuff:
  - `try { ... } catch { return }`
  - Don’t brick the whole feature because one platform is fragile.

### Performance: chunk work to keep frames alive

- If you’re generating lots of items (features, meshes, whatever):
  - Consume in small chunks under a time budget.
  - Use comlink or queues instead of blocking.

### Deterministic fallback when introspection lies

- If you can’t trust computed dimensions/frames/etc:
  - Hardcode the safe number.
  - Add a blunt comment and move on.

### Cache/freeze reusable objects

- Materials, expensive objects, config:
  - Create once.
  - Freeze once.
  - Reuse forever.

## Instant PR review rubric (agent + human)

### Mergeable

- **Scope**: one problem, one fix.
- **Diff**: small, readable, low churn.
- **Behavior**: handles bad input and platform quirks without crashing.
- **Deletion**: removes dead code instead of leaving it commented or half-unused.
- **Perf**: doesn’t add work to hot paths without a cache/chunking plan.
- **Comms**: commit/PR text is direct; no fluff.

### Rejected (rewrite required)

- **Refactor cosplay**: new abstractions for no functional win.
- **Churn**: formatting, renames, rearrangements mixed into a functional change.
- **Edge-case arrogance**: assumes APIs always succeed; throws where a fallback is fine.
- **Dead code hoarding**: commented blocks, unused files kept “for later”.
- **Obvious logging spam**: debug prints left in.
- **Resurrection attempts**: bringing back old features/UI or adding new ones outside the final production feature set.

## Examples (self-contained)

### 1) Don’t crash for edge cases (fail soft)

Bad:

```ts
throw new Error("Not supported yet");
```

Good:

```ts
console.error("Not supported yet");
return;
```

**Ben takeaway**: if it’s not supported yet, don’t crash the app—bail out.

### 2) Guard state before touching UI

Bad:

```ts
textarea.value = state.script;
```

Good:

```ts
if (state.script) textarea.value = state.script;
```

**Ben takeaway**: don’t inject `undefined` into the UI.

### 3) Prefer optional chaining + early returns (2026 TS)

Bad:

```ts
const doc = iframe.contentWindow.document;
doc.body.innerHTML = html;
```

Good:

```ts
const doc = iframe.contentWindow?.document;
if (!doc?.body) return;
doc.body.innerHTML = html;
```

**Ben takeaway**: guard the real-world nulls and keep moving.

### 4) Don't use typechecks at runtime

There's some shit client code in here that checks schemas against io-ts. Don't
do that. You do not need to defend yourself from the fucking server.

### 5) Deterministic over clever

### 6) Pick a sane default and ship.

### 7) Cache the expensive thing (typed)

Bad:

```ts
mesh.material = new StandardMaterial("vox", scene);
```

Good:

```ts
let voxMaterial: StandardMaterial | null = null;

if (!voxMaterial) {
  voxMaterial = new StandardMaterial("vox", scene);
  voxMaterial.freeze();
}

mesh.material = voxMaterial;
```

**Ben takeaway**: one material, frozen, reused. Done. Don't create it until you need it. Then 
don't create it again.

### 7) Delete dead code (no resurrection)

Bad:

```ts
// old thing we might want later
// ...
```

Good:

- Delete the file / codepath.
- Remove the routes/imports.
- Stop pretending you’re coming back.
- Replace an entire dying subsystem with a single line of code at the entrypoint

**Ben takeaway**: dead code is debt. Delete it.

### 7) Use bens form and fuck all classes

    <div class="f">
      <label>Name</label>
      <input type="text" ... />
    </div>

It's simple, we can style it simply. Add fuck all classes,
never add styling css unless instructed to. Layout is ok,
use `1rem` whenever required for padding, no borders, or colors. No solid backgrounds. No font sizes.

Important: Never use css classes starting with a hyphen. Remove hypen-prefix from old code. That shit sucks ass.

## Styling

* Never use border-radius
* Never hard code colors (use css vars)

## Contributor cheat sheet

- Make the diff smaller.
- Remove dead code instead of adding flags.
- Add guards instead of assumptions.
- If a platform is flaky, wrap it and return.
- If “smart” detection fails, hardcode the safe value.

## Refactoring

- **Nuke leaky abstraction**: there are a bunch of stupid leaky abstractions, delete them and move the code back to the calling site. Repeat yourself, don't create dispatchers and indirection.
- **Hardcode the decision**: if the spec says "sort by popular/newest/oldest", those 3 words go in the code. Not a prop. Not an array. Not configurable.
- **0 params > 1 > 2**: every parameter needs a concrete, immediate justification. "Might be useful later" is not a justification.
- **Implement the exact plan snippet**: when a plan shows code, ship that code verbatim. Do not add fields or args not in the plan.
- **When you hit an unplanned problem, add a `// todo`**: do not invent new abstractions mid-implementation. Note it and move on.
- **You are not building a library**: there is one caller. Optimize for that caller, not a hypothetical second one.
- **Assume the developer is fine with reduced functionality**: the goal of all refactoring is to reduce the complexity of the code, that may reduce functionality or add some UI that isnt implemented yet. Ask the developer several yes/no questions to confirm what will be done that might reduce functoinality, dont try and keep everything working at the cost of complexity.

# Pull Requests

* If it's a UI change, add a screenshot to the github PR
* Screenshot doesnt need to be diagnostic, just makes the PRs more pretty when viewing on github

## Release notes

When asked to write release notes:

1. Look at the newest file in `release-notes/` (filenames are `YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md`).
2. Diff the code since that file landed (or since a sensible recent point if the folder is empty). Commit messages are low signal - read the actual `git diff`.
3. Write `release-notes/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md`. First line is `# <title>`. Body is markdown. Zine voice, lowercase subheadings. What changed and why a player cares.
4. Commit and push. Next deploy ingests new files into the blog (`on conflict do nothing`, so edits in the DB stick).
