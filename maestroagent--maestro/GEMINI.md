# Maestro Agent Roster

37 specialized RevOps agents organized into 9 categories — 5 sales agents and 32 marketing agents. Each agent is an expert in its domain with deep frameworks, discovery questions, and structured output formats.

## How Agents Work

- **Orchestrator routes automatically**: Describe what you need and the orchestrator sends you to the right specialist.
- **Direct access**: If you know which agent you need, talk to it directly.
- **Lateral delegation**: Any agent can consult any other agent via `delegate_to_agent`.
- **Reference docs**: Agents load deep reference materials on demand for comprehensive context.
