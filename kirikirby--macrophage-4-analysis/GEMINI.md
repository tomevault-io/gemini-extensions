# AGENTS

## Language Requirement
- Use English for all new narrative content in this file (AGENTS.md).
- Quoted strings and code/comment examples may remain in their original language.

These instructions apply to this repository.

## Encoding / Character Set Requirements
- All repository text files must remain UTF-8 encoded.
- Do not introduce emoji, dingbats, box-drawing characters, or other decorative symbols.
- Prefer ASCII for structural markers in logs/UI text (examples: "OK", "WARN", "X", "|-", "-").
- CJK characters and standard punctuation already used in the script are allowed.

## IMPORTANT: Script Module Index (Update Required)
- This repository maintains a module index for `Macrophage Image Four-Factor Analysis_4.0.0.ijm`.
- Every code change that adds/moves/removes logic must update the index line numbers below.
- Keep the index in sync so future AI can locate modules quickly.

## IMPORTANT: Error Code System (Update Required)
- Every user-facing error message must include a stable error code in the format `[E###]` at the start of the message text.
- Error codes must be kept consistent across CN/JP/EN strings for the same failure.
- When an error is shown or causes an exit, log the error with the code (use the structured log style and `T_log_error`).
- Any new failure points introduced by new features or optimizations must add:
  - A new error code and localized CN/JP/EN messages.
  - A log entry that includes the code.
  - A corresponding entry in the Error Code Index below.
- Validation errors inside dialogs should be recoverable (prompt the user to correct input and continue), not hard-exit the script unless the failure is truly fatal.

## Code Style
- Language: ImageJ macro (.ijm). Script is designed for Fiji and should be treated as Fiji-only.
- Prefer explicit loops and arrays over compact expressions; match existing style.
- Use the existing section layout and separators ("// -----" blocks).
- New functions should follow the existing doc block format:
  - "// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------"
  - "// 関数: name" and short Japanese description lines.
- Keep naming consistent: camelCase for functions, lowerCamel for locals, ALL_CAPS for constants and UI labels (T_*).
- Legacy identifiers may include bead/beads; do not rename functions/variables/constants during terminology cleanup—only update user-facing strings (UI/logs/errors/docs).
- Avoid introducing Unicode unless the file already uses it and it is necessary for UI text.
- Favor clear step-by-step control flow over clever tricks; avoid nested ternaries or compact one-liners.
- Use explicit temporaries for intermediate values when it improves readability or mirrors existing patterns.
- Keep ImageJ macro limitations in mind (no advanced data structures, no regex).
- Maintain existing error handling style: build message strings with replaceSafe and exit/showMessage.
- Keep numeric thresholds and default values grouped with related phase blocks or UI sections.
- Keep the top-of-file header block with the existing fields (概要/目的/想定/署名/版数) and the same separator style.
- Prefer parameter grouping for function interfaces: bundle related values into arrays (e.g., targetParams, imgParams, featureFlags) and unpack inside the function to avoid argument-count limits and keep call sites stable.

## Code Layout / Formatting
- Indentation uses 4 spaces; do not use tabs.
- Brace style is K&R: opening brace on the same line, closing brace aligned with the block start.
- Keep one statement per line; avoid chained assignments.
- Prefer single-line function signatures when they fit; if wrapping is needed, align parameters and place one parameter per line.
- Use the standard phase banner format:
  - "// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------"
  - "// フェーズX: ..."
  - "// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------"
- Use the standard major header format with "// =============================================================================" above and below the title line.
- Keep one blank line between function blocks; within long functions, separate logical blocks with a short Japanese comment header and a blank line.
- For long run()/Dialog calls, break lines after commas/concats and align continued lines; close the call on its own line.
- Multi-line strings should be built with `+` on each new line, aligned with the first line, and end with an explicit `\n` where needed.
- Keep top-of-file global initialization orderly and deterministic: group entries into three blocks (`constants`, `default switches`, `runtime caches`) with short Japanese block headers, and add new globals to the appropriate block instead of appending ad hoc.

## Logging Style
- Logging is structured and tree-like using `T_log_*` labels; do not inline raw log strings in logic.
- Preserve the separator line format (e.g., "----------------------------------------") and use it at phase boundaries.
- Use a consistent prefix scheme:
  - Phase start/end: "OK ..."
  - Per-image entries: "  |-" and nested details with "  |  |-" / "  |  -"
  - Skips/errors: "  |  X ..." or "  |  WARN ..."
- Keep log density similar to the current/old script: phase-level summaries plus per-image key stats; avoid adding verbose per-ROI logs unless explicitly requested.
- Log parameter summaries with labeled placeholders (e.g., `%mode`, `%thr`, `%min-%max`) using `replaceSafe`.

## UI Text / Localization Style
- UI text is instructional and professional; avoid casual tone or slang in any language.
- Terminology: use 目标物/対象物/target object in user-facing strings; do not rename identifiers, tokens, functions, or variables during terminology updates.
- Feature selection dialog text must state: feature 4 is in-cell only, feature 1 & 5 are mutually exclusive, and selected features control which feature-threshold parameters appear.
- Use consistent structure in multi-line dialogs:
  - Short title, then sections like "目的/操作要求/操作步骤/说明" (CN), "目的/手順/説明" (JP), "Purpose/Steps/Notes" (EN).
  - Use numbered steps with `1）` (CN/JP) and `1)` (EN); use bullet points with `-`.
- Keep language parity: CN/JP/EN versions should convey the same intent and detail level, with terminology matched (beads, ROI, sampling, exclusion, parameters).
- Preserve punctuation conventions from the old script:
  - CN/JP text uses full-width punctuation where already established.
  - EN uses ASCII punctuation and quoted keys like "OK"/"T".
- Keep messages concise but complete; avoid long single paragraphs—prefer short blocks with clear line breaks.
- UI strings are grouped by language blocks (CN/JP/EN). When adding new UI text, add it to all three blocks.
- Use existing label keys (T_*) where possible; do not hardcode UI text in logic.
- Keep dialog order and grouping consistent with existing sections (target/bg/roi/excl/format).
- When adding options, also add matching log labels and error strings if referenced in logic.

## Behavior
- Default behaviors should match the current script.
- Do not change logging verbosity or batch mode unless requested.
- Preserve backward compatibility for existing column tokens and data format rules.
- Keep sampling flow and user prompts in the current sequence unless explicitly requested.
- Target sampling treats non-round or large ROIs as clump samples; when cell ROI data is available, in-cell samples inform Feature 4 clump defaults.
- Preserve ROI suffix behavior and default values unless explicitly asked to change them.
- Preserve algorithmic outputs unless explicitly requested; even “refactors” must keep counts, thresholds, grouping, and sorting identical.
- Avoid changing Results table ordering, grouping, or row counts; keep side-by-side PN layout and time grouping rules intact.
- Exclusion definition: exclusion is a post-detection filter that removes candidates already detected by the target algorithm based on learned exclusion samples (similarity/likeness); it must not replace or expand target detection.

## Output/Results
- Keep result columns and tokens stable unless explicitly asked to change them.
- If you add a new output column, also update validation and token parsing lists.
- When modifying formatting rules, update both parsing and sorting logic (rule validation, token mapping, output construction).
- Results table layout requirement (side-by-side by project/PN):
  - Each PN is its own logical table; tables are placed left-to-right in a single Results sheet.
  - Total row count equals the longest PN table; shorter PN tables leave trailing empty rows (no compression/interleaving).
  - This rule applies whether or not per-cell output is enabled.
  - When time parsing is enabled (hasTimeRule): output is grouped by time in ascending numeric order; within each time block, row count equals the maximum PN length for that time; shorter PN blocks leave empty rows until the time block ends; then continue to the next time.
  - If a PN has no data at a time block, its entire block for that time is empty.
  - Per-time summary columns (ETPC/TPCSEM) are computed across all images within the same PN and time, not per single image.
  - When no time rule is active, summary columns are computed across all images within the same PN.
  - Per-cell expansion mode is active when any of TPC/ETPC/TPCSEM appears in dataFormatCols; only per-cell columns vary per row, other columns repeat as needed.
  - Exception: in AUTO_ROI mode, TPC/ETPC/TPCSEM are kept as summary columns and per-cell row expansion is forced off.
  - If per-cell mode is active, per-time summaries (ETPC/TPCSEM) still aggregate across all cells in the PN+time block.
  - "Time parsing enabled" means the filename/folder rule maps <f> to T (f="T") in either file rule or folder rule; time is extracted from subfolder names only when SUBFOLDER_KEEP_MODE is on and a folder rule is provided.
  - If SUBFOLDER_KEEP_MODE is off (flatten mode), time can only be extracted from filename rule; subfolder names are not used for T.
- If time parsing is enabled but a sample has no parsable time string, it is grouped into time=0 and the time label may be blank; do not drop such rows from summaries.

### Results Table Design (Detailed)
- Column layout is deterministic and must remain stable across runs; never re-order columns implicitly.
- Single columns (prefixed by "$" in the column format) appear once at the far-left, in the same order as specified.
- When time is enabled (T column present):
  - T and F columns (non-single) appear once near the left, before any PN-specific columns.
  - Remaining columns are PN-specific and are duplicated per PN, left-to-right in PN order.
  - For multiple PNs, each PN-specific column label is suffixed with `_<PN>` (for example `TPC_pGb`).
  - Time blocks are stacked vertically in ascending numeric order of T.
  - Within each time block, row count equals the maximum PN row count for that time; shorter PN tables are padded with empty strings (not 0).
  - If a PN has no data for a time block, its entire block is empty.
- When time is disabled (no T column):
  - There are no time blocks; PN tables are placed left-to-right.
  - Total row count equals the maximum PN row count; shorter PN tables are padded with empty strings (not 0).
- Fluorescence columns:
  - Only for tokens TB, BIC, TPC, ETPC, TPCSEM.
  - Each fluorescence column is inserted immediately to the right of its base column.
  - Label is `fluoPrefix + baseLabel` (default `#`, but configurable).
  - When a fluorescence image is missing, the fluorescence cells are empty strings, not 0.
- Per-cell expansion:
  - Per-cell mode is active when any of TPC/ETPC/TPCSEM is requested.
  - Exception: in AUTO_ROI mode, TPC/ETPC/TPCSEM remain available but rows are not expanded per cell.
  - In per-cell mode, only per-cell columns vary by row; other columns repeat as needed.
  - Time-block row counts still follow the max-per-PN rule within each time block.

### Filename Extraction (Presets Only)
- Custom filename rules are not supported. The user selects exactly one preset:
  - Windows: `name (1)` (must include the space before `(`).
  - Dolphin: `name1` (digits directly appended, no separator).
  - macOS: `name 1` (single space before trailing digits).
- Parsing behavior:
  - PN is the name portion before the trailing number segment.
  - F is the trailing number segment (digits only).
  - Windows requires a terminal ` (digits)`; if not present, parsing fails.
  - Dolphin rejects separators; if the character before trailing digits is a space, underscore, hyphen, or parenthesis, it is not Dolphin format.
  - macOS requires a space immediately before the trailing digits.
  - Parsing operates on the base filename (extension removed); fluorescence prefix is stripped before parsing.
- Time extraction:
  - Only the literal pattern `number + hr` is supported (for example `24hr`).
  - With SUBFOLDER_KEEP_MODE on, time is read from the subfolder name.
  - With SUBFOLDER_KEEP_MODE off, time is read from the filename.
  - If time parsing fails while time is enabled, time defaults to 0 and the time label may be blank.
- Verbose logs must include per-file parse details for both PN/F and time so failures can be diagnosed from logs alone.

### Parameter Spec System
- Parameter spec generation must emit a deterministic fixed key set that covers all parameter keys used by the macro.
- The copyable output line must be directly pasteable and use the format `PARAM_SPEC=...`.
- For conditionally unavailable keys (mode/feature/exclusion/fluorescence), generation must emit empty values (`key=`), not drop keys.
- Parsing must accept both raw `key=value;...` and `PARAM_SPEC=...`.
- Parsing must only apply keys that are enabled under the current run conditions; disabled keys are ignored.
- Empty values mean "do not override current value"; numeric `0` is a valid explicit value and must not be treated as empty.
- When adding/removing/renaming parameter keys, update all linked parts together:
  - fixed key-order list
  - key validation
  - generation mapping
  - conditional-enable logic
  - parse assignment/validation
  - copyable log output
  - CN/JP/EN parameter-spec hint text

## Comments
- Add brief comments only when the logic is not self-explanatory.
- Do not remove existing author or version notes.
- New comments should explain intent or non-obvious assumptions, not re-state code.
- Comment language: Japanese for code comments and doc blocks; avoid English "NOTE:"-style comments in logic.
- Exception: the AI edit notice at the top of the main script should be present in CN/JP/EN.
- Use full-sentence comments with Japanese punctuation where the surrounding block does so.
- Prefer block-level comments ahead of a logical step or phase; avoid end-of-line comments.
- Typical comment density: one header per phase/section, and occasional inline comments for heuristics, thresholds, or non-obvious control flow.
- Function doc blocks follow the established order:
  - Separator line
  - "関数: name"
  - "概要: ..."
  - "引数: name (type), ..." (single line or short multi-line list)
  - "戻り値: ..."
  - Optional "補足:" / "副作用:" lines if needed
  - Separator line

## Compatibility / Non-Regression
- ImageJ macro does not support arrays-of-arrays; use flat arrays with start/len indexing when grouping or bucketing.
- Avoid returning `newArray(a, b)` where `a` and `b` are arrays; return flat arrays or mutate inputs in-place.
- String empty checks should prefer `lengthOf(s) == 0` when a function may return non-string values; avoid `if (trim2(...) == "")` in ambiguous contexts.
- Avoid compact boolean expressions that rely on implicit string evaluation; prefer explicit `if (...) return 1/0;` patterns.
- For token parsing, prefer a single case-normalization strategy (typically `toLowerCase`) to reduce version-specific API risks.
- When using `replace()`, remember it is regex-based; escape user/content strings via `replaceSafe` to avoid `$` and `\` issues.
- Do not introduce new ImageJ macro features outside the supported subset (no regex, no advanced data structures, no ternary tricks).

## Repository Structure
- `Macrophage Image Four-Factor Analysis_4.0.0.ijm` is the active script to modify unless told otherwise.
- `Macrophage Image Four-Factor Analysis_3.0.2.ijm` is a permanent reference version for graduation research and must never be edited.
- `old/` contains archived legacy scripts for reference only (current set: 1.0, 2.0b, 2.1, 2.2b, 2.2.3, 2.2.4, 2.2.4b, 3.0.0bad, 3.0.1).
- Do not edit files under `old/` unless explicitly requested.
- `README*.md` files are documentation entry points and should retain the AI edit notice.

## Repository Notes
- AI contributors must read `AGENTS.md` before making any edits.
- Keep the AI edit notice at the top of the main script. README.* entry points do not require it.
- License: CC0 1.0 Universal (Public Domain Dedication). Keep `LICENSE` and README license sections in sync.
 - Third-party software/fonts are included and remain under their own licenses. See `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`.
## Maintenance Requirements
- Keep the Script Module Index current after any change that adds/moves/removes logic.
- For any new or modified logic, identify likely failure points and add expected error prompts in CN/JP/EN with error codes and logs (see Error Code System).
- Keep the Parameter Spec System synchronized whenever parameters change (keys/order/generation/parsing/allowed-key gating/log output/CN-JP-EN hints).
- For every bug fix, add a brief, concrete lesson to the Lessons Learned section and keep it aligned with the fix.

## Lessons Learned
- ImageJ/Fiji macro functions have a hard limit on the number of arguments; exceeding it triggers "Too many arguments". Pack related parameters into arrays and unpack inside the function to avoid hitting the limit.
- ImageJ substring() requires valid bounds. Guard indices before substring calls, especially when scanning for tokens with variable lengths.
- Some ImageJ/Fiji macro environments do not support getPixel(x, y, rgb). Use getPixel(x, y) and decode RGB manually when needed.
- Avoid using trim2(...) directly in numeric expressions; assign to a temp string first, then coerce to number.
- For string-returning functions, return a temporary string variable instead of an inline function call to avoid numeric return errors in older macro parsers.
- For array-returning functions, return a temporary array variable instead of an inline function call to avoid array return errors in older macro parsers.
- Avoid comparing string-returning function calls inline; use a temporary string or substring comparison to prevent numeric return errors.
- For recursive helpers, pass mutable arrays (e.g., output lists) as explicit parameters; avoid relying on outer-scope identifiers to prevent "Undefined identifier" errors.
- When validating rule parts, compare a temporary trimmed string instead of calling trim2(...) inline.
- Whitespace-only rule segments (e.g., a single space between slashes) should be treated as literal spaces, not rejected as empty.
- Avoid quoted literals in filename rules; represent spaces with a whitespace-only segment (/ /) and keep validation centralized.
- Use charAtCompat in trim2-style helpers to avoid substring bound errors in inclusive substring environments.
- Prefer charAtCompat in character-scanning utilities (splitByChar/splitCSV) to avoid substring bound errors.
- In string-trimming loops, assign charAtCompat results to a temp before comparisons to avoid numeric-return errors.
- Normalize validation return values to strings early and treat numeric "0" as empty to prevent E199 fallbacks.
- When updating filename rule parsing, keep validation aligned by deriving token presence from parsed patterns (including inline tokens) and rejecting unknown <...> tokens early.
- Keep phase-level default rules in sync with the current filename-rule syntax to prevent false validation errors.
- Guard empty parse arrays before indexing to avoid "Empty array" runtime errors in rule parsing.
- Normalize full-width parentheses/spaces and allow leading/trailing spaces in literals during rule matching to avoid false PN/F parse failures.
- Use normalized match strings for token extraction (including collapsing multiple spaces) so PN/F parsing stays stable under whitespace variations.
- Assign getNumberFromCache results to a temp variable before setResult to avoid numeric-return errors in some macro parsers.
- Assign calcRatio results to a temp variable before setResult to avoid numeric-return errors in some macro parsers.
- Skip setResult for empty values in Results output to avoid NaN placeholders.
- If time parsing yields an empty token, fall back to extracting the first number from the folder/file name to preserve time grouping.
- When parsing time from folder names in deep trees, use the immediate parent folder name rather than the full relative path to avoid false failures.
- When a Results cell should be blank, explicitly write an empty string; leaving it unset can default to 0 in some environments.
- In ROI-only mode, if fluorescence filtering yields zero normal images, re-collect without the fluorescence filter before throwing E008.
- When recursively scanning folders, prefer the directory marker from getFileList (trailing "/") over File.isDirectory to avoid missing subfolders on some paths.
- For OneDrive or other virtual folders, use a fallback directory check by probing getFileList on the entry path.
- Use a trailing slash when probing getFileList for directory detection to avoid false negatives on Windows paths.
- ImageJ macro array mutations from recursive helpers can be unreliable; prefer building lists in the main flow or return flat arrays instead of relying on side effects.
- For filename presets, keep the UI choice separate from the internal pattern string and try explicit patterns per preset to avoid silent PN/F parse failures.
- When parsing time from folder names like "2.5hr", try a pattern that preserves decimals before falling back to digit-only extraction.
- In ROI-only mode with multi-level folders, build imgEntries via recursive traversal before applying E008, rather than checking only the top folder.
- When a recursive helper appends to a shared array, pass the array as a parameter to avoid undefined-identifier errors in some macro parsers.
- If a recursive helper writes into multiple shared arrays, pass each array explicitly to avoid scope/identifier issues.
- For recursive collectors, return a tagged flat array and split it in the caller instead of relying on in-function array mutation.
- Clamp ROI bounds to image extents before using x/y to compute linear indices; out-of-bounds ROI can produce negative idx.
- When validating parameter-spec strings, check key presence separately from value so empty values do not bypass missing/duplicate checks.
- When refactoring repeated loops into helpers, avoid self-recursive calls and rebuild the intended arrays explicitly.
- When providing error-bar columns, use SEM (or clearly labeled SD) and keep token names aligned with the statistic to prevent misuse.
- Initialize cross-function parameters at top level so ImageJ macro treats them as global; assigning inside a function does not create a global if it was never defined.
- Initialize temporary outputs used across phases (for example, parsed rule arrays) at top level to avoid "Undefined variable" errors.
- Arrays assigned inside a helper but read later in the main flow must be initialized at top level so they are treated as globals.
- If a global array is populated in a helper and read later, avoid reassigning it inside the helper; allocate it in the main flow and only mutate elements to keep scope global.
- When array writes inside a helper are treated as local, return a packed flat result and unpack in the main flow to update global arrays safely.
- If exclusion min/max values are normalized in a helper but referenced later (logging or batch analysis), initialize those globals at top level before normalization.
- Initialize arrays used by refresh helpers (for example `roiPaths`) in the main flow before calling them to avoid "Undefined identifier" errors.
- For text output windows, prefer `WindowManager.getWindow` + `TextWindow.append` so tuning logs are not lost in the Log window.
- Debug-mode randomness can be deterministic across runs; stir the RNG with time for meaningful tuning variability.
- Avoid using `var` as a variable name in ImageJ macros; some parsers treat it as a reserved keyword and report syntax errors.
- When log placeholders overlap (for example `%t` and `%tol`), replace longer tokens first to avoid partial substitutions.
- In auto-ROI mode, fluorescence in-cell counting must be mask-based (Otsu/Yen) rather than ROI-Manager based, otherwise counting silently degrades or is skipped.
- For parameter-spec compatibility across modes, emit a fixed full key set, leave unsupported keys empty, and ignore unsupported keys during parse; only validate enabled keys with non-empty values.
- Keep copyable parameter-spec logs directly pasteable (`PARAM_SPEC=...`) and preserve the distinction between empty values (skip) and numeric `0` (valid override).
- In auto-ROI mode, keep single-cell area sampling as a standalone pre-target phase; showing target-sampling step prompts first leads to confusing step order.
- In auto-ROI mode, initialize `autoCellAreaUI` as an unset sentinel (for example `0`) so inferred single-cell area can override it; starting at `1` can silently lock estimation and inflate cell counts.
- In auto-ROI mode, cap estimated cell counts before per-cell array/string expansion to avoid stalls when sampled or manual cell area is unrealistically small.
- In auto-ROI single-cell learning, compute ROI area by mask pixel counting (selectionContains) and filter tiny/invalid ROIs before inference; relying on direct measured Area can keep the learned value near 1 under some ROI/unit combinations.
- In auto-ROI mode, derive default single-cell area from the arithmetic mean of all valid sampled cell areas (sum/count), and apply runtime fallback to inferred/default area if UI/spec values are invalid or too small.
- In auto-ROI mode, keep TPC/ETPC/TPCSEM as summary columns but forcibly disable per-cell row expansion so output remains one row per image.
- In auto-ROI mode, use `AUTO_ROI_MIN_CELL_AREA` consistently when pre-filling/rerunning dialogs; a `<1`-only guard can preserve stale tiny values and cause runtime mismatch with inferred defaults.
- In auto-ROI mode, keep one canonical single-cell area path (`autoCellAreaUI` -> normalize -> `autoCellArea`) and synchronize before batch start; mixed read paths can hide contamination and produce UI/runtime mismatches.
- In some Fiji macro parsers, direct comparisons like `if (trim2(x) == "")` can trigger numeric-return errors; assign `trim2(x)` to a temporary string first, then compare.
- For PARAM_SPEC diagnostics, map keys and displayed values through localized labels in logs so parameter-read traces stay consistent with the selected UI language.
- In PARAM_SPEC output helpers, avoid returning string-conversion helper calls inline (for example strict/mode/preset mapping); assign helper results to temporaries before returning.
- For error-code prefix checks (for example `"[E"`), cache `substring(...)` into a temporary string before comparison in conditionals to avoid parser-specific numeric-return issues.
- Before applying PARAM_SPEC overrides, initialize all runtime UI/analysis variables at top level; otherwise function-local assignments may not materialize globals and later normalization can fail with "Undefined variable".
- For Electron desktop UI in this repository, prefer a pure solid dark background over native/addon vibrancy paths when performance or visual stability regresses; keep the darkest areas at true black (`#000000`) for clear layering.
- When implementing the preview stage-light effect, keep it as lightweight CSS gradients plus a single loading sweep animation; avoid `backdrop-filter` and platform blur dependencies to prevent input lag while dragging windows.
- If desktop surface strategy changes (for example removing vibrancy), update main-process handlers, preload bridge, renderer types, renderer boot logic, and related i18n keys together to avoid stale IPC/type contracts.
- For resizable Electron panes, keep pointer-driven drag resize transition-free for direct mouse tracking, and only enable short snap animations when crossing collapse/restore thresholds.
- During OS window resize, debounce workspace layout state commits and flush on mouseup/maximize changes to reduce layout thrash while keeping top/bottom bars responsive.
- For pane splitters, crossing collapse/restore thresholds should trigger a short snap animation plus temporary drag-lock; this prevents continuous layout churn while still preserving responsive pointer tracking.
- For horizontally scrollable data tables with sticky headers, render a viewport-width sticky header backdrop layer separate from content-width header cells to avoid uncovered regions after horizontal scrolling.
- For splitter-driven middle-pane collapse, preserve the opposite-side neighbor width and anchor collapse to the drag direction (left-drag anchors left, right-drag anchors right) to avoid unintuitive pane jumps.
- For sticky table headers in dense grids, use a dedicated sticky wrapper sharing the exact column template with body rows; pseudo-element overlays can hide or clip trailing header cells.
- For desktop startup UX, separate "boot completed" from "enter main workspace" so debug flags can pause on a startup screen without affecting production auto-entry behavior.
- For startup-shell rendering, keep a dedicated boot top bar with only window controls and hide menu/status areas until boot is complete; this prevents premature UI exposure while preserving native window actions.
- If boot-to-workbench should be instant after debug confirmation, pre-mount and pre-render the main workspace behind a startup overlay (opacity/pointer-events gating) so "enter" only toggles visibility, not first render.
- Apply unit scaling for pixel-based outputs in one centralized pre-output step so TB/BIC/TPC/ETPC/TPCSEM and fluorescence counterparts remain numerically consistent.

## Explanations
- When asked to explain the script, provide structured summaries (overview -> phases -> key functions).
- Avoid line-by-line narration unless explicitly requested.
- Offer to drill into specific phases or functions with targeted detail.
- Emphasize code style and comment conventions when the user asks for analysis of style.

## Style Checklist
- **Structure:** preserve section separators; keep phase ordering; group constants near their phase/use.
- **Naming:** camelCase for functions; lowerCamel for locals; ALL_CAPS for constants/UI labels (T_*); avoid new naming schemes.
- **Control Flow:** prefer explicit loops; avoid dense expressions; use temporaries for clarity.
- **UI/Strings:** add CN/JP/EN strings together; avoid hardcoded UI text in logic; keep labels aligned with dialogs.
- **Errors/Logs:** use replaceSafe for templated messages; keep log verbosity behavior unchanged; add log labels for new options.
- **Data Format:** if adding columns/tokens, update validation, token maps, and output construction consistently.
- **Results:** keep column order stable; avoid breaking existing tokens; maintain per-cell expansion rules.
- **Comments:** only when intent is non-obvious; keep existing author/version notes.
- **Compatibility:** no nested arrays; avoid regex pitfalls in `replace`; use `lengthOf` for empty checks; keep parsing/formatting logic stable.
