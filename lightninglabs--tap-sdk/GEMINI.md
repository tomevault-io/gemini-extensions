# AGENTS.md — tap-sdk

## Project Overview

`tap-sdk` is the Go source-of-truth implementation of the Taproot Assets
application SDK. It exposes typed wallet, issuer, universe, proof, burn, and
transfer surfaces over `tapd` without requiring application developers to deal
with low-level protobuf types.

**Repository:** `github.com/lightninglabs/tap-sdk`
**Language:** Go (source of truth for future language SDKs)
**Status:** Pre-v1.0 (breaking API changes possible)

### Key Design Principles

1. **SDK types are the only public surface.** Users never import `taprpc`
   or other `taproot-assets` packages.
2. **Transports are implementation details.** All proto conversions happen at
   the `grpc/` and `rest/` package boundaries.
3. **Wallet is the entrypoint.** High-level operations go through `Wallet`,
   low-level through the `Client` interface.
4. **Public types live at the root.** Fixed-size byte arrays and business
   structs are discoverable from the main `tapsdk` import.
5. **The SDK is opinionated.** The public surface should not blindly mirror
   raw `taprpc` semantics when a cleaner Taproot Assets model exists.
6. **Design docs are durable.** `docs/design/` captures accepted API and
   architecture decisions, not short-lived implementation plans.

### Asset Identity Model

The SDK must distinguish between the protocol's low-level identifiers and the
user-facing identity model:

- **Fungible assets are identified by group key** in the normal SDK surface.
  The `asset_id` is tranche-level and should not be the primary identifier
  that application developers work with for fungible assets.
- **Collectibles / non-fungible assets are identified by asset ID.** In that
  case the tranche is the asset, so exposing the asset ID is correct.
- Low-level client wrappers may still need to translate raw RPC fields, but
  high-level APIs and docs should consistently present the semantic model:
  fungible => group key, non-fungible => asset ID.

### Address Defaults

The SDK should expose an opinionated default address flow:

- **V2 addresses are the default** for the normal, high-level receive/send
  surface unless there is a concrete reason to do otherwise.
- Older address versions are considered advanced or compatibility paths and
  should remain available through lower-level client methods instead of being
  promoted in the primary UX.

## Development

### Build Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `make build` | Build the SDK |
| `make lint` | Run golangci-lint (via Docker) |
| `make fmt` | Format code (gosimports + gofmt) |
| `make unit` | Run all unit tests |
| `make unit pkg=<pkg>` | Run tests for specific package |
| `make unit pkg=<pkg> case=<test>` | Run a specific test case |
| `make itest-main` | Integration tests against tapd built from `taproot-assets` main (local-dev default) |
| `make itest` | Integration tests against the pinned released tapd image (what CI uses) |
| `make itest-run-main case=<test>` | Run a single itest against tapd-main without re-spinning the stack |

### Integration tests

Prefer `make itest-main` locally. It builds tapd from the latest
`taproot-assets` main so proto/RPC changes in tapd are exercised before
CI catches them. CI runs `make itest` (pinned released image) because
bleeding-edge tapd may not have a pre-built image yet — only reach for
plain `itest` when reproducing CI.

### Code Style

Follow Lightning Labs conventions (see `.gemini/styleguide.md`):

- **80 character line limit** (tabs count as 8 spaces)
- **Every exported function** must have a comment starting with function name
- **Comments explain "why"**, not "what"
- **Table-driven tests** with `require` assertions
- **Logical stanzas** separated by blank lines
- **No AI watermarks** — no `Co-authored-by: Claude` or similar

### Commit Style

Format: `subsystem: short description`

Keep commit messages concise. **Commits are not PR descriptions.** The
subject line should be under ~70 characters; if a body is needed, aim
for 2–4 short sentences — not paragraphs, not bulleted lists, not
design discussions. Explain the *why* when it isn't obvious from the
diff; skip the body entirely when the subject already says it.

PR descriptions belong in the PR body (with context, test plan, etc.),
not in every commit. A reader running `git log --oneline` should be
able to skim the change set without drowning.

Examples:
- `wallet: add FetchAsset request and response types`
- `grpc: wrap ListBalances RPC`
- `wallet: add high-level balance query method`
- `multi: fix lint issues across packages`

### Publishing

Do not include AI/tool attribution in branch names, PR titles, PR bodies, or
commit messages. In particular, never use `codex/` branch prefixes or
`[codex]` PR title prefixes.

Use normal repository style instead:
- Branch: plain descriptive name, e.g. `standardize-fee-rates-sat-vb`
- Commit: subsystem style, e.g. `multi: standardize fee rates on sat/vB`
- PR title: subsystem style, e.g. `multi: standardize fee rates on sat/vB`

### PR Workflow

1. Create or update a design doc under `docs/design/` only for non-trivial
   design work, architecture decisions, or API redesigns
2. Skip dedicated design docs for straightforward low-level RPC wrapper work
   that does not introduce new user-facing design
3. Implement with granular, logical commits (not incremental)
4. Force-push to keep history clean
5. All CI must pass (lint, format, compile, unit tests)
6. Wait for review before merge

### Adding New RPC Wrappers

When wrapping a new `tapd` RPC:

1. Define SDK types in the root package (request, response, domain objects)
2. Implement the gRPC call in the appropriate `grpc/` client
3. Add marshal/unmarshal functions at the `grpc/` boundary
4. Add the method to the appropriate interface in `clients.go`
5. Optionally add a convenience method on `Wallet`
6. Write unit tests with mocks + table-driven patterns
7. Add or extend integration tests when the flow is user-visible
8. Update README or docs pages when the public surface changes
9. Update CHANGELOG.md only when preparing a public release

## Dependencies

- **tapd** — Taproot Assets daemon (gRPC/REST over TLS + macaroons)
- **taproot-assets/taprpc** — gRPC service definitions (proto, lightweight module)
- **btcsuite/btcd** — Bitcoin primitives (PSBT, keys, crypto)

### Dependency Boundary

`taprpc` types must never appear in exported signatures outside transport
packages. The `grpc/` and `rest/` sub-client structs are unexported, and their
internal helpers must remain unexported to prevent `taprpc` types from leaking
through embedding into transport clients.

When adding new wrappers, ensure all proto-to-SDK conversion happens inside
transport packages and that tests outside transport packages only use root SDK
types.

## Success Metrics

The SDK is successful when:

1. Any project (lightning-terminal, loop, taproot-assets itests) can use
   `tap-sdk` instead of raw `taprpc` calls.
2. No consumer needs to import `taproot-assets` packages directly.
3. The SDK surface is opinionated with good defaults, not a 1:1 proto mirror.
4. Comprehensive test coverage exists for all wrapped RPCs.
