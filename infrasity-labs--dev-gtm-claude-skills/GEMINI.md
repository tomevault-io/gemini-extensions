# AGENTS.md — Claude Code Skills Library

This repo is a library of **Claude Code skills, agents, and extensions** — reusable AI-powered workflows for SEO, marketing, content, web design, and product management. Skills are invoked as slash commands inside Claude Code (e.g. `/seo-audit`, `/blog-write`, `/analytics`).

## How Skills Work

Each skill lives in its own directory with a single `SKILL.md` file.

### SKILL.md Format

```markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: >
  One-paragraph description used for trigger matching. This is what Claude
  reads to decide when to invoke the skill. Be specific about trigger phrases.
user-invokable: true
argument-hint: "[url] [optional-flags]"
metadata:
  category: seo | blog | marketing | web-design | pm | utility
---

# Skill Title

Skill body — instructions, frameworks, prompts, and workflow steps.
```

**Key frontmatter fields:**
- `name` — must match the directory name exactly
- `description` — trigger-matching text; include all phrases that should activate this skill
- `user-invokable` — `true` means users can call it via `/skill-name`
- `argument-hint` — shown in autocomplete to guide input format
- `metadata.category` — used for grouping and discovery

---

## How Extensions Work

Extensions add MCP server integrations on top of base skills. Each extension ships with:

```
extensions/<name>/
├── install.sh       # Installs skill, agent, and MCP config into ~/.claude/
├── uninstall.sh     # Removes all installed files and MCP config
├── install.ps1      # Windows equivalent
├── uninstall.ps1
├── README.md        # Setup guide + usage examples
├── agents/          # Agent definition(s) for this extension
├── skills/          # Skill(s) this extension provides
└── docs/            # Setup documentation
```

### Installing an extension

```bash
# From the repository root
./seo-skills/extensions/dataforseo/install.sh    # prompts for API credentials
./seo-skills/extensions/ahrefs/install.sh
./seo-skills/extensions/firecrawl/install.sh
```

The install script:
1. Copies skill files into `~/.claude/skills/`
2. Copies agent files into `~/.claude/agents/`
3. Writes MCP server config into `~/.claude/settings.json`
4. Pre-warms the npm package

### Uninstalling

```bash
./seo-skills/extensions/dataforseo/uninstall.sh
```

---

## Adding a New Skill

1. Create a directory under the appropriate cluster:
   ```bash
   mkdir seo-skills/my-new-skill
   ```

2. Create `SKILL.md` using the format above.

3. Test it in Claude Code:
   ```
   /my-new-skill
   ```

4. If the skill needs an MCP server, create an extension under `extensions/` following the existing pattern (copy `extensions/dataforseo/` as a template).

---

## Runtime Requirements

| Requirement | Version | Used By |
|------------|---------|---------|
| Node.js | 20+ | All MCP-backed extensions |
| npx | ships with npm | Extension installers |
| Python | 3.10+ | SEO scripts, PM scripts, Writing analysis |
| Claude Code CLI | latest | Running all skills |

### Python packages (SEO cluster)

```bash
pip install -r seo-skills/requirements.txt
```

### Python packages (Writing cluster)

```bash
pip install -r writing-skills/requirements.txt
```

PM scripts (`rice_prioritizer.py`, `okr_cascade_generator.py`, `user_story_generator.py`) use stdlib only — no pip install needed.

## API Credentials by Cluster

| Cluster | Credentials Required |
|---------|---------------------|
| SEO | DataForSEO, Ahrefs, Firecrawl, Bing Webmaster, Profound, SERanking, Google Search Console (OAuth), Google Analytics 4 (OAuth) |
| Writing | Ahrefs, DataForSEO, Google Search Console (OAuth), Google Analytics 4 (OAuth), NotebookLM (Google account) |
| Marketing | GA4 (OAuth), GSC (OAuth), Ahrefs, DataForSEO, Firecrawl, Bing Webmaster, Apollo.io, Slack Bot token, Figma PAT |
| Web Design | Slack Bot token |
| Product Management | Figma PAT, Canva API key, Slack Bot token, Linear API key, Notion integration token, Jira API token |
| Utility | Ahrefs, DataForSEO, Apollo.io, Slack Bot token |

Credentials are set during `install.sh` — they are stored in `~/.claude/settings.json` under `mcpServers.env`, never committed to the repo.

---

## What NOT to Do

- **Do not edit `.claude/` files directly.** They are managed by install/uninstall scripts. Manual edits will be overwritten.
- **Do not commit `~/.claude/settings.json`.** It contains API credentials.
- **Do not rename skill directories** without updating the `name:` field in `SKILL.md` — they must match exactly.
- **Do not run `install.sh` from a different working directory** — scripts resolve paths relative to their location.
- **Do not modify extension skill files in `.claude/extensions/`** — edit the source files in `seo-skills/extensions/` and re-run the install script.

| Marketing | `marketing-skills/` | ~27 | 0 (gsc-ga4, slack, apollo, figma planned) |
| Web Design | `web-design/` | 4 | 0 (slack planned) |
| Product Management | `product-management-skills/` | 8 | 0 (figma, canva, slack, linear, notion, jira planned) |
| Utility | `skills/` | ~10 | 0 (apollo, slack planned) |
