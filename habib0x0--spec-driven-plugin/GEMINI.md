# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Overview

This is a Claude Code plugin that provides spec-driven development workflows. It guides feature development through three phases: Requirements (EARS notation), Design (architecture), and Tasks (trackable implementation items).

## Plugin Structure

```
.claude-plugin/plugin.json  - Plugin manifest (name, version, metadata)
commands/                   - Slash command definitions
scripts/                    - Standalone execution scripts (spec-exec, spec-loop)
skills/spec-workflow/       - Main skill with reference docs
agents/                     - Subagent definitions
templates/                  - Document scaffolding for specs
```

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/spec-brainstorm` | Brainstorm a feature idea before spec creation |
| `/spec <name>` | Start new spec with 3-phase workflow |
| `/spec-refine` | Update existing requirements/design |
| `/spec-tasks` | Regenerate tasks from spec |
| `/spec-status` | Show progress and task completion |
| `/spec-validate` | Validate completeness and consistency |

| `/spec-docs` | Generate documentation from spec and implementation |
| `/spec-release` | Generate release notes, changelog, and deployment checklist |
| `/spec-verify` | Run post-deployment smoke tests against a live environment |
| `/spec-retro` | Run a retrospective to capture lessons learned |
| `/research` | Deep research before planning — parallel agents search docs, web, and codebase |
| `/zoom-out` | Step up a layer of abstraction and map modules, interfaces, and callers |
| `/ubiquitous-language` | Extract domain terms into a canonical glossary with flagged ambiguities |

## Model Routing

The plugin routes each agent to a **capability tier** rather than a specific model. Three tiers cover the range of work:

| Tier | Capability | Agents | Rationale |
|------|-----------|--------|-----------|
| `reasoning` | Deep reasoning, design, complex analysis | spec-planner, spec-reviewer | Requirements, architecture, and review are where subtle mistakes are most expensive |
| `standard` | Structured code production, validation, documentation | spec-tasker, spec-validator, spec-implementer, spec-tester, spec-acceptor, spec-consultant, spec-documenter, spec-scanner | Fast and accurate for well-specified work |
| `lightweight` | Targeted fixes, small patches | spec-debugger | Throughput matters more than depth when the failure is already identified |

**Claude Code** resolves these tier aliases automatically (`reasoning` → `opus`, `standard` → `sonnet`, `lightweight` → `haiku`). **Codex** and other CLIs do not resolve aliases — set `SPEC_MODEL_*` environment variables to map each agent to a model your backend supports.

The `/spec` command delegates to these agents via the Task tool. Users don't need to manually switch models unless they want to override defaults.

Each agent's model can be overridden via environment variable (e.g., `SPEC_MODEL_PLANNER=deepseek-reasoner`). See [`docs/advanced/model-routing.md`](docs/advanced/model-routing.md) for mapping tables for OpenAI, Google, DeepSeek, local routers, and per-agent override details.

For implementation after spec completion, the `standard` tier is recommended — the spec provides all the context needed for accurate code generation.

## Key Concepts

### EARS Notation
All acceptance criteria use Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax:
```
WHEN [condition/trigger]
THE SYSTEM SHALL [expected behavior]
```

Variations include `WHILE` (state-driven), `IF/WHEN` (conditional), and `SHALL NOT` (negative).

### Spec File Location
Specs are created in the target project at `.claude/specs/<feature-name>/`:
- `requirements.md` - User stories with EARS acceptance criteria
- `design.md` - Architecture, components, data models
- `tasks.md` - Implementation tasks synced to Claude Code todos

### Project Profile

The project profile (`_project-profile.md`) captures codebase intelligence that agents use to wire new code correctly. Located at `.claude/specs/_project-profile.md`, it contains six sections:

1. **Stack** - Framework, language, backend, database, styling
2. **Patterns** - Detected code patterns with confidence levels (high/medium/low)
3. **Entity Registry** - Table of domain entities and their CRUD implementation status
4. **Registration Points** - Specific `file:line` locations where new artifacts must be registered
5. **Regression Markers** - Bug fixes with affected files and regression check descriptions
6. **Manual Overrides** - User-editable section preserved across rescans

The profile is auto-created on the first `/spec` run (Phase 0 auto-scan). For large codebases or monorepos, the scanner may split profiles by domain into `_profile-<domain>.md` files with a `_profile-index.md` listing.

### Task Synchronization
Tasks in `tasks.md` sync to Claude Code's todo system via TaskCreate/TaskUpdate. Task phases: Setup, Core Implementation, Integration, Testing, Polish.

## Developing This Plugin

### Adding Commands
Create a new `.md` file in `commands/` with YAML frontmatter:
```yaml
---
name: command-name
description: What it does
allowed-tools:
  - Read
  - Write
---
```

### Adding Reference Material
Place supplementary docs in `skills/spec-workflow/references/`. The skill file references these with relative paths.

### Template Variables
Templates use `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` syntax for substitution during spec creation.

## Execution Mode

After completing the spec workflow (Requirements, Design, Tasks), use the execution scripts to implement autonomously:

- `spec-exec.sh` - Single iteration: implements one task, tests, updates spec, commits
- `spec-loop.sh` - Loops until all tasks complete or max iterations reached. Pass `--on-complete <command>` to run a custom command when the loop finishes
- `spec-complete.sh` - Full post-completion pipeline: accept -> docs -> release -> retro. Run manually after `spec-loop.sh` completes

Both scripts build a prompt from the spec files and run `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions`. The loop version re-reads spec files each iteration to pick up changes from previous runs.

Completion is detected via `<promise>COMPLETE</promise>` in Claude's output.

### Post-Implementation Scripts

After all tasks are complete, these scripts handle the remaining SDLC phases (or run automatically via `spec-complete.sh`):

- `spec-accept.sh` - User acceptance testing against requirements (outputs `ACCEPTED`/`REJECTED`)
- `spec-docs.sh` - Generate documentation from spec + code (API ref, user guide, ADR, runbook)
- `spec-release.sh` - Release notes, changelog, deployment checklist; optional `--tag` and `--release`
- `spec-verify.sh` - Post-deployment smoke test against a live URL (exits 0/1 for CI/CD)
- `spec-retro.sh` - Retrospective analysis of a completed spec; accepts `--spec-name <name>` (outputs `RETRO_COMPLETE`)

## Communication Style

When a user sends a greeting (hi, hello, etc.) with no specific request, respond briefly and ask what they'd like to work on. Do NOT analyze the project or provide unsolicited information.

## UI/TUI Development

When fixing UI/visual bugs, do NOT guess from code alone. Ask the user to describe the exact visual behavior or wait for screenshot descriptions. Make minimal, targeted changes — do not refactor surrounding code.

## Config & Dotfiles

After modifying shell configs (tmux, neovim, zsh, bash), always verify the change took effect:
- Reload or source the config file explicitly
- Test a related command to confirm the change applied
- Never report success without verification
- If a reload doesn't work, diagnose before proceeding (the file may have syntax errors)

## Languages & Build

Primary languages: Rust, TypeScript, Go, Python.

When editing Rust code, run `cargo check` after changes to catch compilation errors early. When editing TypeScript, ensure `.tsx` extension for JSX files and run `npx tsc --noEmit` to validate. When editing shell scripts, use `shellcheck $FILE` to catch issues before running.

## Validation Rules

The spec-validator agent checks:
- Requirements have proper EARS notation (no vague terms like "quickly", "properly")
- Design addresses all requirements
- Tasks trace back to requirements with valid dependencies (no cycles)
- Cross-document consistency (IDs match between files)

## Error Handling and Resilience

When running spec-loops or parallel agent tasks, follow these rules to prevent unproductive loops:

### Stop Condition for Repeated Failures
- If an API error, model access error, or tool failure occurs, stop after 2 failed attempts and report clearly
- Do NOT loop retrying the same failing approach indefinitely
- When blocked, explain: (1) the exact error, (2) your hypothesis about the root cause, (3) what information/access you'd need to fix it
- If a task is fundamentally blocked (e.g., missing git remote, model unavailable), skip it and log to progress.md

### Preflight Validation Before Large Workflows
Before launching `/spec-loop` or spawning parallel agents, run these checks:
1. Verify git remote is configured (`git remote -v`)
2. Test model access with a simple prompt (5-10 words)
3. Confirm the project builds (`npm run build`, `cargo build`, etc.)
4. List any blockers or known failures

Only proceed if all checks pass. A 2-minute preflight check saves hours if the workflow fails mid-run.

### Checkpoint and Recovery for Long Runs
- When running spec-loops with 40+ tasks, use checkpoint files to track progress
- If a loop fails or rate-limits partway through, resume from the last successful checkpoint instead of starting over
- Log each iteration's progress to progress.md with clear completion markers
- Use `spec-loop.sh --max-iterations <n>` to control batch size, not to retry failed tasks indefinitely

### Configuration and Dotfile Changes
After modifying shell configs (tmux, neovim, zsh), always verify the change took effect:
- Reload or source the config file
- Test a related command to confirm the change applied
- Never report success without verification
- If a reload doesn't work, diagnose before proceeding (the file may have a syntax error)

## Release Checklist

After any fix or feature session, before closing out, ALWAYS run the release script. Never rely on the user to remember.

```bash
# patch — bug fixes, doc corrections, small tweaks
bash scripts/spec-release.sh --version-bump patch

# minor — new commands, new agents, new behavior
bash scripts/spec-release.sh --version-bump minor

# major — breaking changes, large rewrites
bash scripts/spec-release.sh --version-bump major

# bump and push in one step
bash scripts/spec-release.sh --version-bump patch --tag
```
