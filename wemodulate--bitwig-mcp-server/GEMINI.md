# Bitwig MCP Server - Claude Code Guide

## Project Overview

This project creates a server that allows Claude to control Bitwig Studio through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It translates between MCP requests from Claude and OSC commands to Bitwig Studio's control API.

## Project-Specific Guidelines

### Development Workflow

For this project, follow these specific steps:

1. Use an incremental approach focusing on one feature at a time
2. Update/create appropriate tests for each change
3. Follow this test procedure for each change:
   - Run `pytest tests/` to verify changes
   - Run `mypy bitwig_mcp_server/` for type checking
   - Run `ruff check bitwig_mcp_server/` for linting
   - Run `black bitwig_mcp_server/` for code formatting

### MCP Implementation Guidelines

- Tools should follow the MCP Tool schema pattern
- Each tool should map to one or more OSC commands
- Error handling should be comprehensive and informative
- Consider user experience when designing tool APIs
- Resources should provide clear, structured information
- Use URIs that follow a consistent pattern
- Cache resource data appropriately to avoid excessive OSC traffic

### Priority: Song Creation and Composition Workflows

Based on review of common music production workflows, we're prioritizing song creation and composition capabilities to make Claude most useful for creative tasks. This reflects a standard progression from ideation to finalization in the music creation process.

#### Workflow-Driven Development

Our development priorities are guided by the natural progression of music creation:

1. **Ideation and Composition** - The initial creative phase where musical ideas are formed
2. **Sound Design** - The process of creating and refining the sonic palette
3. **Arrangement** - Organizing musical ideas into a coherent structure
4. **Mixing and Production** - Refining and balancing the sounds to create a polished product

By following this workflow, we ensure that Claude can assist meaningfully at each stage of the music creation process, with a focus on the creative aspects first. This approach enables users to realize their musical ideas more efficiently and effectively.

#### Critical Missing Infrastructure

For Claude to effectively assist with music production, we need to implement two critical components that are currently missing:

1. **Device Browser and Library Access**

   - A comprehensive representation of available Bitwig devices
   - Ability to browse and load devices by category
   - Access to device presets and metadata
   - Mechanism to query device capabilities and parameters
   - Device recommendation system based on semantic search

2. **Project State Representation**
   - Complete overview of the current project structure
   - Access to MIDI clip contents for analysis
   - Arrangement and scene information
   - Project metadata (tempo, key, markers, time signature changes)
   - Ability to query and modify the project state programmatically

These components form the foundation upon which all creative workflows depend, and should be prioritized in the immediate implementation phase.
