# AGENTS.md

Documentation map for RubyLens. Start with [README.md](README.md) for usage and development setup.

## Working conventions

Maintainer preferences for agents working in this repository.

Code:

- Do not introduce attributes that duplicate or are derivable from data that is already present — a stored copy can drift out of sync with its source. Derive from the single authoritative representation instead (for example, a package's declaration count is its `declarations.length`, never a separate field).
- No one-line delegator methods — inline the underlying call at each call site, even when it is wordier.
- Cheap identity markers (like the payload `schema` fields) are worth keeping, but only with their purpose documented in a correctly named home (see [docs/SCHEMAS.md](docs/SCHEMAS.md)).

Workflow:

- Never post GitHub comments, review replies, or reactions on the maintainer's behalf. Respond to review feedback with code changes and report conclusions in the conversation.
- Communicate in plain English, and be concise.
- Verification is empirical, not just green tests: prove behavior-preserving changes by generating artifacts from both versions and comparing the embedded data and rendered pixels, and prove features by running them end to end.
- Diagnose before assuming a regression — reproduce first; missing output is often environmental (for example, dependency gems not installed in the generating bundle).
- Adversarially review any complexity you add: every new guard, field, helper, or layer must survive the question of whether it needs to exist at all before it ships.

## Contracts

- [PRODUCT.md](PRODUCT.md) — the product contract: surfaces, meaning and scale, privacy, and non-goals.
- [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) — the design contract: stellar identity, Explorer interaction, motion, and Showcase rules.

## Engineering references

- [docs/SCHEMAS.md](docs/SCHEMAS.md) — the payload contract: snapshot, art, and showcase schema shapes, and when to bump their versions.
- [docs/PERFORMANCE.md](docs/PERFORMANCE.md) — scale instrumentation, complete-row artifact evidence, and the dependency-aggregation benchmark.
- [docs/EXPLORER_SHOWCASE_RENDERING.md](docs/EXPLORER_SHOWCASE_RENDERING.md) — shared renderer data and intentional Explorer/Showcase presentation differences.

## Visual design

- [docs/STELLAR_DESIGN_RESEARCH.md](docs/STELLAR_DESIGN_RESEARCH.md) — the astrophysical visual grammar: morphology, light, and performance rules the renderer follows.
- [docs/specs/2026-07-14-galaxy-morphology-design.md](docs/specs/2026-07-14-galaxy-morphology-design.md) — the accepted deterministic galaxy morphology design.

## Renderer geometry practices

Rules distilled from iterating on the deterministic galaxy recipes in
`assets/runtime/report.js`. They exist because each one was violated once and
produced a visual regression that unit tests missed.

- Judge geometry changes by renders, not code review: top-down scatter
  small-multiples for structure plus real Explorer renders, before and after,
  including dense realistic star counts — several defects only appear at
  scale or on real projects.
- Ground visual tuning in observed galaxy structure (see
  [docs/STELLAR_DESIGN_RESEARCH.md](docs/STELLAR_DESIGN_RESEARCH.md)) rather
  than iterating by taste, and prefer physics laws with closed-form
  inverse-CDF samplers; observation wins over theory when they disagree.
- Never let draws pile onto a bound: clamping radii or flattening a sweep to
  a constant concentrates stars into arcs, rings, or spokes. Respread the
  mass instead, and rely on `test/js/position_distribution.test.mjs` — when
  adding a recipe, extend it and calibrate thresholds against a known-bad
  build so the guard demonstrably fails on the defect.
- A predicate the renderer uses must be the same function any test measures;
  never let a test assert a proxy gate while the renderer adds conditions.
- Geometry shared between the project galaxy and dependency clouds must live
  in one helper; hand-copied variants have diverged before. Verify intended
  no-op refactors seed-for-seed against the previous runtime.
- `unit(seed, channel)` draws must keep channels disjoint per population, and
  `normal(seed, channel)` consumes both `channel` and `channel + 1`;
  collisions silently bias distributions. Name tuned constants and their
  channels in a frozen recipe block (see `ARM_RECIPE`) instead of inlining
  them, keeping only formula-local ratios inline.
- Ruby tests never assert on frontend asset content: everything the browser
  consumes — the runtime, shells, and stylesheets — is tested in the vitest
  suite (`test/js/`). Ruby asserts assembly and write mechanics, packaging,
  and Ruby-side constants only. Classifier knob changes still need
  `REGENERATE_FIXTURES=1 bundle exec rake` and the pinned knob rows updated.

## Indexing pipeline

`lib/rubylens/index/` splits one Rubydex run into collaborators with separate
concerns. Keep new indexing work inside whichever one already owns the concern.

- `Manifest` decides *what* is indexed: the Git-selected workspace plus the
  packages resolved from `Gemfile.lock`.
- `GitPackageSource` owns git checkouts specifically, because their gemspecs
  name their own require paths and their trees may symlink anywhere, so every
  path needs resolving and re-checking against the canonical package root. It
  reports a skip reason and lets `Manifest` keep one warning vocabulary across
  every package source. Its `NixStoreProvider` is the only reason a checkout
  resolving outside the bundle is ever trusted; widening that pattern widens
  what RubyLens will read, so `test/index/git_package_source_test.rb` pins it.
- `LocationIndex` answers per-URI questions (path, workspace membership,
  test/core scope, owning package) and memoizes them. Every other collaborator
  asks it instead of re-deriving paths, which is what makes per-definition
  questions affordable.
- `DeclarationCollector` streams `graph.declarations` once into workspace
  namespaces, category tallies, and dependency rows. `ConstantReferenceCollector`
  owns inbound counts and the bounded travel-link sample.
- `RubydexAdapter` orchestrates those and assembles the snapshot. It is the
  privacy boundary: rows leave as integers, and the only strings that survive
  are namespace, package, and project names.

Newly introduced classes here carry inline RBS signatures (`#:` above each
method, `# @rbs!` blocks for `Data` shapes), matching the style Rubydex itself
ships. No type checker runs yet, so the signatures are documentation and
nothing enforces them; treat a wrong one as a doc bug and fix it in place.
Existing untyped classes are being annotated as they are otherwise touched
rather than in one sweep.

## Rubydex 0.4.0 integration notes

Constraints observed against pinned Rubydex 0.4.0 that shape `lib/rubylens/index/`. Re-verify each one when upgrading the pin; the upstream [API reference](https://shopify.github.io/rubydex/) is the source of truth for the evolving pre-1.0 interface.

- `Graph.new` no longer accepts `workspace_path:`. RubyLens constructs a plain graph and passes absolute, Git-selected files to `Graph#index_all`. `Graph.configure_for_workspace` and `Config.load` read and validate the target repository's `rubydex.toml`; the adapter must not call either because report generation must not silently honor target exclusions.
- `Graph#index_workspace` and the upstream MCP indexer read ignored and untracked Ruby files, and since 0.3.0 also index the workspace's entire locked bundle (through Bundler) plus core RBS signatures, raising `Bundler::GemfileNotFound` outside a bundle. Private-safe indexing passes an explicit Git-selected manifest to `Graph#index_all`; `RubyLens::GitRepository` and `RubyLens::Index::Manifest` exist to build that manifest.
- `index_workspace` also discards package provenance and dependency depth. The manifest parses `Gemfile.lock` itself and joins packages to indexed documents by path.
- `Location#to_file_path` returns paths still percent-encoded, so `RubyLens::Index::SourcePath` decodes file URIs itself.
- Definitions and references expose `#document` since 0.3.0, and `document.uri` is measurably cheaper than going through a `Location`. `LocationIndex` therefore answers workspace, scope, and package questions by URI string, and collectors materialize a `Location` only for the definitions and references that contribute coordinates. `document.uri` always equals `location.uri` (verified across 144k definitions and 324k references).
- The 0.2.9 rule against visibility predicates is lifted: 0.3.0 resolves `module_function` visibility, and `visibility` no longer aborts in native code (verified over every method declaration in this repository, which uses `module_function`). Nothing in the adapter consumes visibility yet; treat it as an available signal, not a dependency.
- Method references are text occurrences with optional receiver information, not a call graph. Never present them as call edges.
- When an `rbs` gem is visible to the ambient `Gem.path`, Rubydex can add core and stdlib signature documents whose definitions merge into workspace declaration identities. RBS policy must stay a deliberate choice, not inherited from the environment.
- Since 0.4.0, RBS `attr_reader`, `attr_writer`, and `attr_accessor` entries create method declarations but not instance-variable declarations. An upgrade can therefore increase workspace and dependency method totals for unchanged RBS input.
- Since 0.3.0, a constant whose value could name a namespace (`Data.define` results, frozen collection constants, RBS-declared constants) no longer also surfaces as a spurious `Rubydex::Module` declaration; it becomes a `Todo` namespace, which `DeclarationCollector#eligible?` already filters, and RBS-declared dependency constants surface as constant declarations. On the 0.3.0 upgrade this dropped module tallies in `category_stats` and package `ruby_counts` while drawn namespaces, links, and method/constant counts were proven identical.
- `Namespace#ancestors` and `#descendants` include the declaration itself; the adapter subtracts self from both counts.
- Graph and declaration accessors (`declarations`, `definitions`, `location`, `name`, …) return fresh enumerators, wrapper objects, and strings on every call, so the adapter fetches each value once and keys its caches by URI. Iteration order is stable within a process but differs between processes, so behavior-preservation proofs must run both adapter versions against one shared graph in a single process rather than comparing artifacts from separate runs.
