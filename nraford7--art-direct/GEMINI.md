## art-direct

> Art direction for any content — reads text, PDF, Word, HTML, PPT, then proposes 2-3 creative directions with photography style, mood, and visual language. After selection, generates AI image prompts and visual briefs section-by-section. Use when the user shares content and needs visual direction, image sourcing, or creative direction for any material.


# Art Direct

Turn content into visual direction. Point this at anything — a deck, a document, an essay, a brief, a webpage — and get back a creative direction you can actually execute.

## When to Use

- User shares a file (any format) and needs visuals for it
- Developing visual identity for content before building/designing
- Translating written material into photography/illustration direction
- Creating image prompts for AI generation tools
- Art directing a presentation, document, report, or website
- Reviewing existing visuals against content intent (critique mode)

## Supported Inputs

Read content from whatever the user provides:

| Format | How to read |
|--------|-------------|
| `.txt`, `.md` | Read tool directly |
| `.html` | Read tool, strip tags to extract text + structure |
| `.pdf` | Read tool with pages parameter |
| `.docx` | Extract via `python3 -c "import docx; ..."` or `textutil -convert txt` on macOS |
| `.pptx` | Extract via `python3 -c "from pptx import Presentation; ..."` |
| `.rtf` | `textutil -convert txt` on macOS |
| URL | WebFetch tool |

If a format doesn't extract cleanly, ask the user to paste the text.

## The Workflow

```
INGEST CONTENT → ANALYSE → PROPOSE 2-3 DIRECTIONS → USER SELECTS → VISUAL BRIEF + PROMPTS
```

---

## Stage 1: Content Ingestion & Analysis

Read the full content. Extract:

1. **Structure** — What are the units? (slides, sections, chapters, paragraphs, pages)
2. **Core themes** — The 2-3 big ideas the content is actually about
3. **Narrative arc** — Does it build? Contrast? Layer? List?
4. **Audience** — Who receives this? What do they expect to see?
5. **Tone** — Authoritative? Inspirational? Intimate? Provocative? Technical?
6. **Key moments** — Which sections carry the most weight, demand the strongest visuals?
7. **Existing visual language** — If the content already has images, assess what's working and what isn't

**Output a brief content summary** before proceeding. Keep it tight — this is for alignment, not a book report.

---

## Stage 2: Creative Direction Proposals

**If house style template provided** (`--style <name>`):
- Validate content fits the style
- Note any tensions and how to bridge them
- Skip to Stage 3 with adapted style guide

**If no house style:**

Propose **2-3 distinct visual directions**. Each must be genuinely different — not three shades of the same idea. For each:

```
DIRECTION: [Name — a short handle like "Archival Authority" or "Warm Machinery"]

MOOD
What it feels like: [emotional quality in 2-3 words]
Energy: [calm / dynamic / tense / contemplative / electric]

PHOTOGRAPHY STYLE
Type: [documentary / editorial / conceptual / abstract / archival / illustrative]
Subjects: [what appears in the images]
Lighting: [quality of light]
Color treatment: [warm/cool shift, saturation, film stock reference]
Composition: [framing approach]

REFERENCE TOUCHSTONES
"Think [X] meets [Y]" — cite real publications, campaigns, photographers, or brands

WHAT THIS DIRECTION AVOIDS
[Specific clichés and visual tropes this direction rejects]

WHY THIS FITS THE CONTENT
[1-2 sentences connecting direction to content themes]
```

Present all directions. User picks one (or asks for a hybrid). Lock the choice.

---

## Stage 3: Visual Style Guide

Once direction is selected, output the working style guide:

```
VISUAL STYLE GUIDE: [Content Title]
Direction: [Chosen direction]

PHOTOGRAPHY STYLE
─────────────────
Type: [Documentary / Editorial / Conceptual / Abstract / Archival]
Subjects: [What to feature — specific, not generic]
Composition: [Framing rules]
Lighting: [Light quality]
Color treatment: [Color approach, film stock if relevant]

MOOD & TONE
───────────
Primary emotion: [e.g., quiet confidence]
Supporting emotions: [e.g., warmth, precision]
Energy level: [Calm / Dynamic / Tense / Contemplative]

CONSISTENCY RULES
─────────────────
• [Shared quality all images must have]
• [Human subject guidelines]
• [Color palette anchors — hex codes]
• [Aspect ratio defaults]

CLICHÉ BLACKLIST
────────────────
• [Content-specific images to reject]
• [Generic tropes to avoid]
• [Overused metaphors for these themes]

AI GENERATION DEFAULTS
──────────────────────
Photography suffix: [standard prompt additions for photo-style generation]
Illustration suffix: [standard prompt additions for illustration-style generation]
```

---

## Stage 4: Section-by-Section Execution

Work through the content in its natural units (slides, sections, chapters, key passages). For each:

### Step 1: Interpret the section's job
What must the visual communicate? What's the emotional beat?

### Step 2: Apply the Five-Lens Framework

Generate options through five lenses:

| Lens | What it shows | When to use |
|------|---------------|-------------|
| **Literal** | The thing itself, shot with intention | Content is already specific |
| **Human** | People experiencing or doing it | Need emotional connection |
| **Environmental** | Setting, atmosphere, texture | Setting mood, transitions |
| **Metaphorical** | Concrete visual analogy | Making abstract tangible |
| **Oblique** | Abstract, unexpected angle | Provoking thought, standing out |

### Step 3: Output the Visual Brief

For the **recommended lens** (guided by the style guide's lens preferences), output:

```
SECTION: "[Section title or key line]"
VISUAL JOB: [What this image must do]
LENS: [Which lens and why]

CONCEPT
[2-3 sentence description of the exact image — specific enough
that a photographer could shoot it or a designer could find it]

AI GENERATION PROMPTS
─────────────────────
MIDJOURNEY:
[Full prompt with style suffixes, --ar, --v, --style flags]

DALL-E / GPT IMAGE:
[Natural language prompt optimized for DALL-E]

GEMINI:
[Prompt formatted for Gemini image generation]

IDEOGRAM:
[Prompt formatted for Ideogram, especially for any text-in-image needs]

SOURCING GUIDANCE
─────────────────
If searching (not generating):
  Search: [2-3 specific, refined search queries]
  Where: [Specific sources — see Source Guide below]
  Avoid: [What will come up that you should skip]

ALTERNATIVES
────────────
[1-2 other lens options briefly described, in case the primary doesn't land]
```

### Step 4: For content with many sections

Don't generate all sections unprompted. Output:
1. The first 2-3 sections as examples
2. A summary table of all remaining sections with recommended lens and one-line concept
3. Ask which sections to develop fully

---

## The Five-Lens Framework (Detail)

For any concept, five ways to see it:

| Lens | "Digital transformation" | "Supply chain resilience" |
|------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Literal** | Server room corridor, blinking LEDs | Cargo ship cutting through rough seas |
| **Human** | Developer's face lit by dual monitors at 2am | Dockworker's hands checking manifest in rain |
| **Environmental** | Empty office at dawn, single laptop glowing | Fog lifting off container yard at sunrise |
| **Metaphorical** | Old film projector casting light on blank wall | Spider web holding dew drops — tension + beauty |
| **Oblique** | Child's hand drawing a robot | Dominos frozen mid-fall, one glowing |

**The oblique lens is the hardest and the most valuable.** It's the image that makes someone stop and think. Use it for hero images and opening sections.

---

## Source Guide

**Do not default to stock photo sites.** Stock search produces generic results regardless of how specific your terms are. Instead:

### Primary: AI Generation
The best match for precise creative vision. Generate exactly what the concept describes.
- **Midjourney** — Best for photographic realism and cinematic quality
- **DALL-E / GPT Image** — Best for conceptual and illustrative work
- **Gemini** — Good for diagrams, text-in-image, data visualization
- **Ideogram** — Best when image includes readable text or typography

### Secondary: Editorial & Archival Sources
When you need *real* photography (historical, documentary, journalistic):
- **Getty Editorial** — Photojournalism, historical archives
- **Magnum Photos** — Documentary photography
- **Library of Congress** — US historical archives, public domain
- **NASA Image Gallery** — Space, earth science, technology
- **Wikimedia Commons** — Public domain, historical
- **British Museum / Smithsonian** — Historical objects and documents
- **Internet Archive** — Historical documents, publications, ephemera
- **Google Arts & Culture** — Museum collections, artworks

### Tertiary: Curated Stock (when you must)
- **Unsplash** — Best for environmental/atmospheric shots, not people
- **Pexels** — Acceptable for textures, backgrounds, abstract
- **Avoid for**: People, business scenarios, technology in use, anything conceptual

### For Specific Needs
| Need | Best source |
|------|-------------|
| Historical technology | Smithsonian, Computer History Museum, Science Museum UK |
| Architecture | ArchDaily, Dezeen photography |
| Scientific | Nature journal imagery, NOAA, ESA/Hubble |
| Cultural | British Library, NYPL Digital Collections |
| Texture/material | Generate via AI — more control |

## Anti-Cliché Guide

### Universal Blacklist
These images are invisible — viewers have seen them thousands of times:
- Handshakes (any kind)
- Lightbulb = idea
- Puzzle pieces connecting
- Person on mountain summit
- Hands holding globe
- Diverse team pointing at whiteboard
- Plant sprouting = growth
- Rocket = launch/speed
- Chess = strategy
- Maze = complexity
- Road diverging in forest = choice
- Iceberg = hidden depth
- Bridge = connection

### The Reframing Technique
When you catch yourself reaching for a cliché:

1. **Name the cliché** — "I'm about to search for a lightbulb"
2. **Ask: What does this concept *feel* like?** — Not look like. Feel like.
3. **Ask: What moment captures this for a real person?** — Specificity kills cliché
4. **Generate that instead**

Example: "Innovation"
- Cliché: Lightbulb, circuit board, rocket
- Feels like: The moment before you know if it works
- Real moment: Engineer's hand hovering over a switch, not yet thrown
- That's the image

---

## Critique Mode

When pointed at content that already has images (existing deck, webpage, document):

### Step 1: Ingest & View Everything

Read all content. View every image. Do the work before speaking.

### Step 2: Overall Visual Language Summary

Open with a top-level assessment of the visual language across the entire piece. Cover:

- **What register are the images in?** (archival, editorial, stock, mixed — name it)
- **Is there a unified visual language?** If not, how many competing registers are present?
- **What's the gap between content intent and visual execution?** The content is trying to say X; the images are saying Y.
- **What's working and what isn't** — broad strokes, not image-by-image yet

Keep this to a short, direct paragraph or two. This is the headline diagnosis.

### Step 3: Section-by-Section Summary

For each section/slide/chapter, give a **high-level summary** — not an image-by-image table. For each section:

```
SECTION: [Title or key line]
CONTENT INTENT: [What this section is trying to communicate]
VISUAL EXECUTION: [What the images are actually doing — 1-2 sentences]
VERDICT: [Working / Partially working / Not working — and why in one line]
STRONGEST IMAGE: [Which one and why, if any]
WEAKEST IMAGE: [Which one and why — name the specific problem]
```

Only go image-by-image if the user asks to drill into a specific section.

### Step 4: Recommendations

End with **specific, opinionated recommendations** — not open-ended observations. The format:

```
RECOMMENDED DIRECTION
─────────────────────
Register: [The specific visual register I recommend — e.g., "archival-documentary
          with warm color treatment" not just "pick a register"]
Why: [1-2 sentences connecting this to the content's actual themes and audience]
Reference: [Think X meets Y — cite real touchstones]

WHAT TO KEEP
────────────
• [Specific images that already work, and why they're the standard]

WHAT TO REMOVE IMMEDIATELY
──────────────────────────
• [Images that actively damage the piece — stock, wrong brand, wrong tone]

WHAT TO REPLACE
───────────────
• [Images that are weak/generic — with one-line replacement concepts]

CONSISTENCY RULE
────────────────
[The single unifying quality all images should share — stated as a rule
that can be applied as a yes/no test to any candidate image]
```

**Be specific. Be opinionated.** Don't say "commit to one register" — say "I recommend archival-documentary with warm tungsten color treatment, because this content is about heritage and the images need to feel like they were pulled from a real company archive. Think Bell Labs photography meets Kinfolk's material warmth."

Then ask: **"Does this direction feel right? If so, I'll generate replacement briefs with AI prompts for every image that needs to change."**

### Step 5: Replacement Briefs (after user confirms)

Once the user agrees to the recommended direction, generate replacement visual briefs for every image flagged for removal or replacement. Use the full Stage 4 section-by-section format:

- Lock the recommended direction as the working style guide
- For each image to replace, output the full visual brief with:
  - Concept (specific enough to shoot or generate)
  - AI generation prompts (Midjourney, DALL-E, Gemini, Ideogram)
  - Sourcing guidance (where to find real alternatives if not generating)
  - One alternative lens option
- For sections that need additional images (currently too few), recommend how many and provide briefs

**Output format:** Generate all replacement briefs at once, numbered to match the original image positions. Export to a text file on the user's Desktop for easy reference and handoff.

### Step 6: Handoff

After replacement briefs are generated, offer next steps:

- **"Generate now"** — Generate images via fal.ai (Flux 2 Pro) directly from the briefs
- **"Export briefs"** — Save all prompts and guidance to a file for use in Midjourney/DALL-E/external tools
- **"Rebuild the deck"** — Feed the style guide and replacement images into keynote-slides-skill to produce a revised version
- **"Save as house style"** — Lock the recommended direction as a reusable YAML template for future work with this brand

---

## Image Generation via fal.ai

When the user selects **"Generate now"**, generate images using Flux 2 Pro via the fal.ai API.

**Requirements:** `$FAL_API_KEY` environment variable must be set.

### How to generate

For each image brief, run this via Bash:

```bash
curl -s "https://queue.fal.run/fal-ai/flux-pro/v1.1" \
  -H "Authorization: Key $FAL_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "prompt": "<THE DALL-E/FLUX PROMPT FROM THE VISUAL BRIEF>",
    "image_size": "landscape_16_9",
    "num_images": 1,
    "safety_tolerance": "5"
  }'
```

This returns a JSON response with a `request_id`. Poll for the result:

```bash
curl -s "https://queue.fal.run/fal-ai/flux-pro/v1.1/requests/<REQUEST_ID>" \
  -H "Authorization: Key $FAL_API_KEY"
```

When status is `"COMPLETED"`, the response contains `images[0].url`. Download it:

```bash
curl -sL "<IMAGE_URL>" -o "<OUTPUT_PATH>"
```

### Generation workflow

1. Create an output directory: `.art-direction/generated/` (in the project) or a Desktop folder
2. For each visual brief, take the DALL-E/GPT Image prompt (these work best with Flux)
3. Submit to fal.ai, poll for completion, download the result
4. Name files by section: `section-01-heritage-grid.jpg`, `section-02-legacy-of-discovery.jpg`, etc.
5. After all images are generated, display them for review using the Read tool
6. User can approve, request regeneration with adjusted prompts, or switch to a different lens

### Image size options

| `image_size` value | Use for |
|-------------------|---------|
| `landscape_16_9` | Presentation slides, hero images |
| `landscape_4_3` | Standard slides, documents |
| `portrait_4_3` | Vertical layouts, mobile |
| `square` | Social media, thumbnails |
| `square_hd` | High-res square |

### Batch generation

When generating multiple images, submit all requests first (don't wait for each one), then poll for results. This parallelizes the GPU work.

```bash
# Submit all requests, collect request IDs
for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do
  curl -s "https://queue.fal.run/fal-ai/flux-pro/v1.1" \
    -H "Authorization: Key $FAL_API_KEY" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "{\"prompt\": \"$PROMPT\", \"image_size\": \"landscape_16_9\"}" \
    | python3 -c "import sys,json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['request_id'])"
done

# Then poll each request_id for results
```

### Cost

Flux 2 Pro via fal.ai is pay-per-image. Typical cost is ~$0.05-0.10 per image. A full deck replacement (10-15 images) runs about $1-2.

### Fallback

If `$FAL_API_KEY` is not set or the API is unavailable:
- Export briefs to file instead
- Note that the user can paste prompts into Midjourney, ChatGPT image gen, or higgsfield.ai manually
