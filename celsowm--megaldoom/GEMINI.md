# AGENTS.md

Repo-wide notes for AI coding agents working on this codebase. This file is
**durable guidance**: how to measure, what the invariants are, and what not to
do. It should stay roughly this size.

Dated investigations — what was tried on a given day, with the before/after
tables and the reasoning — live in [LOG.md](LOG.md). Put new findings there and
leave only the standing rule here. If a LOG entry has no consequence for future
work, it does not need a line in this file.

## Standing rules

**Verify assembly against C, and prove the check can fail.** `renderer_pack.c`'s
`compare_stride2_column_asm` (DEBUG_PERF) runs the asm span and the per-tile C
reference into two canary-guarded scratch blocks and compares. Read back
`asm_mismatches`, `asm_canary_failures` and `asm_checked_tiles` after any change
to `src/renderer/renderer_hotpath.s`. If you touch the harness itself, also inject a
deliberate fault and confirm it reports non-zero before reverting — this harness
spent months silently comparing asm against asm and reporting success (LOG,
2026-08-04).

**Not every route is valid for an A/B comparison.** Only routes that end at the
same player pose in both builds can be compared by run average; a faster build
walks somewhere else and rasterizes a different scene. `stationary-combat`,
`checkpoints` and `slow-turn` have held pose-stable; `tour-east-combat` and
`barrel-pointblank` do not. Confirm by checking that the mixed/flat tile counts
(or billboard byte counts) are identical on both sides before believing a delta.

**The view tilemap is column-major**, `view_tile_index(tile_x, tile_y) =
tile_x * VIEW_TILE_H + tile_y`. A column's tiles are contiguous, and screen row
`y` of byte lane `L` sits at `(y>>3)*32 + (y&7)*4 + L`, which is identically
`4*y + L`. Two shipped optimizations rest on this, and one real bug came from
assuming row-major (LOG, 2026-08-03).

**Budgets: 64 KB work RAM, 4 MB ROM.** The work-RAM guardrail is the binding
one — `tools/check-rom.ps1` errors below 16 KB free and SGDK panics at boot
around 13.7 KB. ROM is *not* tight: `.text` is ~1.39 MB against a 4 MB cap, so
there is ~2.6 MB of headroom. The 1408 KB figure some notes used is just where
`sizebnd` pads `out/rom.bin`, not a limit. Check `size.exe out/rom.out` against
the 4 MB cap before ever calling a precompute-vs-compute tradeoff unaffordable.
`ENABLE_BANK_SWITCH` (SSF mapper, 12 MB) exists but its `0x300000` window is for
cold bulk assets — never put a table sampled at pixel rate behind it.

**Fidelity tradeoffs need the user judging motion.** A static screenshot
approval does not survive real gameplay; the stride-4 revert (LOG, 2026-07-27)
is the precedent.

## Dead ends — do not redo without new evidence

Each is measured and written up in [LOG.md](LOG.md); the date locates the entry.

- **Partial base-bank upload** — the 300-tile upload is ~2 vblanks of a ~12
  vblank frame; DMA-side levers cannot recover what the CPU is spending
  (2026-07-19).
- **`RAY_COL_STRIDE` 4** — shipped, then reverted. Faster, but the user rejected
  the fidelity loss in motion (2026-07-22 → 2026-07-27).
- **Billboard projection spatial pre-cull** (2026-07-21) and **visible-subsector
  billboard cull** (2026-07-29) — both cost more than they saved.
- **Normalizing `fx_sin`/`fx_cos` to unit amplitude** — renders the world ~20%
  larger and costs 2.7x in sprite rasterization. See the invariant below
  (2026-07-30).
- **Duplicating `FREEDOOM_WALL_PACKED_PAIRS` to drop `andi.w #63`** — it fits in
  ROM now, but the post loops are only ~a quarter of the pack stage, so it would
  buy ~1% for +736 KB (2026-08-04).
- **Applying the billboard gather/apply row cache unconditionally** — +44% on
  `stationary-combat`. It is gated on magnification for a reason (2026-08-04).

## How to measure renderer frame cost (headless, no BlastEm UI needed)

1. Build with perf instrumentation and the deterministic-route checkpoint hook:
   ```
   $env:EXTRA_FLAGS="-DDEBUG_BLASTEM_CHECKPOINT=1"; .\tools\build-windows.ps1 -DebugPerf
   ```
2. Resolve the perf mailbox symbol:
   ```
   python tools/resolve-symbol.py out/symbol.txt g_debug_perf_mailbox --bytes 128
   ```
3. Run the deterministic route through the custom BlastEm build and capture a report:
   ```
   .externals/blastem/build/windows/blastem.exe -b 600 out/rom.bin \
     --md-route tools/routes/checkpoints.txt --md-report out/perf.json \
     --md-perf-mailbox <ADDR>:128
   ```
   `-b <frames>` is required or BlastEm never exits and no report is written.
4. Decode the `perfMailbox` hex blob as `RendererPerfSnapshot` (see
   `src/renderer/renderer_perf.h`) using **m68000 struct alignment** (u16/u32 align to
   2 bytes, bool is 1 byte) — a plain-C decode gets the field offsets wrong.

`tools/routes/checkpoints.txt` ends in sustained movement (no combat/rotation
segment) — it is the **worst case for temporal-coherence-based optimizations**.

`tools/routes/tour-east-combat.txt` (7335 frames, run with `-b 7400`) is the
first route that actually leaves the start room: through the NE corridor, C-opens
the group-0 door at x=1536, fights past enemies into the zigzag area, ending at
(2416, 3081) angle 106 (verify via the `g_player` mailbox). Its scenes are
richer than the three start-room routes: at release speed (cadence probe,
2026-07-21) pack averages **5.58 vblanks/rebuild vs 3.0 in the start room** —
the canned routes understate pack cost by ~2x. Max frame observed: 34 vblanks.
Chained turn legs drift (turn ramp scales with elapsed_frames, which varies
with scene cost), so appending legs needs pose re-verification after EVERY leg;
do not trust dead-reckoned headings more than ~2 legs deep.

## Real release framerate (current: 2026-08-04, cadence probe)

A checkpoint-only build (no -DebugPerf) publishes a `CadenceSnapshot`
(decode with `tools/decode-cadence.py`). **This is the ground truth**, and it
differs sharply from what DEBUG_PERF builds imply — DEBUG_PERF's own
instrumentation distorts the timing it reports.

- **Idle frames hit the 2-vblank (30fps) target.** The cost is entirely in
  rebuild frames, which is why a route's average says little on its own: check
  `rebuild frames` against `iterations`.
- **Rebuild frames, per stage** (`stationary-combat` / `tour-east-combat`):
  cast 5700 / 4100, pack 2750 / 5400, projection ~1500 both, billboard 2500 /
  1600 subticks. Cast and pack are the frame; pack roughly doubles in motion
  because rotation doubles the mixed (wall) tile count.
- Divide `cast` and `pack` by `rebuild frames`, but `projection` and
  `billboard` by `scene frames` — those two run every scene frame. Getting this
  wrong understated billboard cost ~6x for weeks (LOG, 2026-08-03).
- Cast's counted workload is tiny (~50 nodes, ~55 box projections, ~30 segs
  tested, 11-16 drawn per rebuild) — per-unit constant factors dominate.
- Projection re-measures all ~112 registry objects whenever the player moves
  **or turns** (the measure cache keys on exact pose, so it misses in motion),
  which is why it is a near-constant ~1500 regardless of what is on screen.
- Anything whose cost scales with on-screen area needs its **worst frame**, not
  its mean: `bb WORST frame` exists because a point-blank sprite ran 30x the
  route average (LOG, 2026-08-04).

Consequence: DMA-side levers (sparse FB, partial uploads) can recover at most
~2 vblanks; the frame is CPU-bound in cast+pack. Smoothness work should target
those two stages or frame-pacing, not upload bytes.

### `fx_sin`/`fx_cos` carry a deliberate 1.1839 gain (fixed 2026-07-30)

`sin_quarter_q8`'s 3rd/5th Taylor coefficients were 41 and 5 — each exactly a
quarter of correct (165, 20) — so the table was a near-linear ramp peaking at 361
instead of `FX_ONE`. The view basis is `(cos, sin)` with `right =
perp(forward)`, so a magnitude error scales `depth` and `lateral` together:
screen-x stayed exact (the scale cancels in `PROJ*lateral/depth`) but wall and
sprite height go as `1/|basis|`. `|basis|/FX_ONE` swung **1.0645..1.4102** with
heading, so **every wall and sprite pulsed 32.5% with a 90° period as the player
turned** — a wall 256 units dead ahead measured 28px facing an axis and 37px
facing diagonally — and frame cost breathed with it. `tools/test-bsp-render-math.py`
reproduced the same buggy polynomial, which is why the differential model agreed
with the ROM and never caught it.

**Normalizing to unit amplitude was measured and rejected.** It shrinks
view-space depth ~17%, rendering the world ~20% larger, which costs **2.7× in
sprite rasterization**: checkpoints 11.79 → 15.50 vb/frame (5.1 → 3.9 fps), of
which +2.84 of the +3.71 vb is billboard raster alone. The wall pipeline barely
moved. So the coefficients now carry a 1.1839 gain — the old table's *mean*
magnitude — giving the same average rendered size and movement speed as before
while removing the heading-dependent variation (magnitude ratio 1.3248 → 1.0192,
heading error −3.03..+4.43° → −0.19..+1.60°).

**The gain is user-approved in motion** (2026-07-30, playing the release ROM:
"no visual problems"), which per the stride-4 lesson below is the only judgement
that qualifies a fidelity change. Treat the non-unit amplitude as intended, not
as a leftover bug.

Consequences to know before touching trig or scale:
- `fx_sin`/`fx_cos` return `1.1839*sin`, **not** `sin`; `|basis|` is ~303.
  The gain cancels in any *ratio* of two basis projections, but not where a
  projection is an absolute length: height, view-space depth, `FOG_SHIFT`
  banding, and movement thrust all carry it.
- `tools/test-world-scale.py` models thrust as `command*THRUST_SCALE`, i.e. an
  exactly-unit basis, so real movement runs ~18% above its certified
  `walk=283.6u/s`. That gap predates the gain; do not "fix" it by normalizing
  the table without re-measuring the sprite cost above.
- E1M1 starts at angle **192, exactly axis-aligned**, where the old table sat at
  its 1.4102 maximum and rendered everything at its smallest and cheapest. So
  the new table renders ~19% *larger* than before at axis-aligned headings and
  ~16% smaller at diagonals; a start-room route will show it as a small
  regression that is a wash averaged over headings. Same-pose A/B on
  stationary-combat: cast 6090 → 6070, pack 4225 → 4615.
- Both baked reciprocal LUTs stay valid — `bsp_inv_depth_lut.h` guards on
  `depth >= BSP_NEAR` and `billboard_projection_lut.h` on the `forward` value
  itself, neither on world distance.
