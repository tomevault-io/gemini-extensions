# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

```bash
# Build
cargo build
cargo build --release

# Build the React UI assets required by Rust include_str! routes
corepack enable
yarn --cwd src/design install --frozen-lockfile
yarn --cwd src/design build

# Run all Rust tests with release warning policy
RUSTFLAGS="-D warnings" cargo test

# Run a single test by name
cargo test <test_name>

# Run tests in a specific module
cargo test middleware::plugins::jwt_inspector

# Lint
cargo clippy -- -D warnings

# Run the proxy. A clean checkout will build src/design/dist automatically
# if Node/Yarn are available; explicit UI build is still faster in CI.
cargo run
```

> **Critical:** run the full test suite before release, not only `cargo test --lib`. Browser tests live under `tests/browser` and use Playwright.

## Architecture

### Three-layer separation

1. **Transport** (`main.rs`, `core/engine.rs`) — hyper accept loop, CONNECT handling, MITM TLS, reqwest forwarding  
2. **Traffic manipulation** (`middleware/`) — inspect, rewrite, throttle, pause, mock  
3. **Control plane** (`management.rs`, `api/`, `storage.rs`) — axum REST API, web UI, JSON persistence

### Request lifecycle

```
hyper accept loop (main.rs)
  ├─ CONNECT request → mitm_intercept() or TCP tunnel (copy_bidirectional)
  └─ all other requests → proxy_dispatch_layer (axum middleware)
       ├─ Host == localhost → axum router (management UI / API)
       └─ else → ProxyEngine::handle_request()
            1. Buffer body (up to max_body_bytes)
            2. Run Request Middleware Chain (insertion order)
            3. Strip internal headers, resolve target URL
            4. Forward via reqwest
            5. Run Response Middleware Chain (reverse order)
            6. Return to client
```

### Middleware system

New traffic features = implement `Middleware` trait. No engine changes needed.

```rust
#[async_trait]
pub trait Middleware: Send + Sync {
    fn name(&self) -> &str;
    async fn on_request(&self, ctx: &mut RequestContext) -> MiddlewareAction;
    async fn on_response(&self, ctx: &mut ResponseContext) -> MiddlewareAction;
}
// MiddlewareAction: Continue | StopAndReturn | Pause
```

`StopAndReturn` returns 403 by default. To return a custom response (mock, Lua abort), embed a JSON payload in `ctx.headers["x-oproxy-mock-response"]` before returning `StopAndReturn`. The engine reads and serves it.

**Middleware chain insertion order** (`runtime/state.rs`):
1. AccessControl (block/allow rules)
2. CaptureFilter (skip recording for filtered hosts)
3. DnsOverride (rewrite upstream host)
4. MapRemote (routing table)
5. Throttling (latency/bandwidth)
6. Rewrite (request/response mutations)
7. Breakpoint (pause on match)
8. JwtInspector / GraphQLInspector / GrpcInspector (payload inspection)
9. Inspection (record session)
10. MapLocal (serve local files) ← short-circuits to file instead of forwarding
11. Mock (return canned responses)
12. Lua (custom request/response logic)
13. Inspection response-pass (record response)

Plugins running before step 9 record the original request. Steps 10–12 can short-circuit with `StopAndReturn`, preventing upstream forwarding.

### Internal middleware ↔ engine side-channel

Middleware plugins exchange data with each other and the engine through **typed,
in-memory fields** on `RequestContext` / `ResponseContext` (all `#[serde(skip)]`, so
they never serialise into recordings/exports and can never leak to the upstream
server). This replaces the former `x-oproxy-*` pseudo-header protocol — there is no
JSON-in-header encoding, no base64 round-trip for binary mock bodies, and a client
can no longer spoof these by sending matching headers (the engine defensively strips
any client-supplied `x-oproxy-*` request header before forwarding).

| Field | Set by | Read by | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `RequestContext.skip_recording: bool` | CaptureFilterMiddleware | InspectionMiddleware | Skip session recording for filtered hosts |
| `RequestContext.session_id: Option<String>` | InspectionMiddleware | engine.rs | Correlate response to exact request session |
| `RequestContext.destination: Option<String>` | RoutingMiddleware / DnsOverride / MITM | engine.rs | Override upstream target URL |
| `RequestContext.inspector: InspectorData` | JWT / GraphQL / gRPC inspectors | InspectionMiddleware | Parsed inspector data → `Exchange.inspector_data` |
| `RequestContext.mock_response: Option<InterceptedResponse>` | Mock / Rewrite / Lua abort / Breakpoint timeout | engine.rs on StopAndReturn | Short-circuit response returned instead of forwarding |

`InterceptedResponse { status: u16, headers, body: Bytes, tags: Vec<String> }` carries
the body as raw `Bytes`, so binary mock payloads survive without base64. The MITM TLS
layer passes its target via `engine.handle_request_with_destination(req, dest)` rather
than a header. `ResponseContext.tags: Vec<String>` carries session tags (e.g. `"mock"`)
to attach when the exchange is recorded.

### Binary body forwarding

`RequestContext.body` is a lossy UTF-8 string. `body_bytes` holds the original bytes. If a middleware modifies `body`, it **must** set `body_bytes = None`; otherwise the engine forwards the original bytes intact (critical for images, protobuf, zip).

### AppState

`Arc<AppState>` is shared by all axum handlers. Fields:

```
proxy_engine        Arc<ProxyEngine>             — reqwest clients + middleware chain
session_manager     Arc<SessionManager>          — in-memory traffic log + SSE broadcast
storage_path        PathBuf                      — JSON persistence directory
config              Config                       — startup config (immutable after init)
webhooks            Arc<RwLock<Vec<WebhookConfig>>>
mock_rules          Arc<RwLock<Vec<MockRule>>>
lua_scripts         Arc<RwLock<Vec<LuaScript>>>
breakpoint_manager  Arc<BreakpointManager>
api_handler         Arc<ApiHandler>              — session/rewrite/breakpoint CRUD
routing_table       Arc<RwLock<HashMap<...>>>
...                 (throttling, dns_overrides, map_local, capture_filter)
```

`ProxyEngine` uses `tokio::sync::RwLock<(Client, Client)>` internally for hot-reload of the upstream proxy config. Call `engine.http_client().await` to get a clone; call `engine.set_upstream_proxy(url).await` to rebuild clients.

### Persistence

`storage.rs` contains `load_*` / `save_*` pairs for each persisted type. The `save_*` functions are **async** and write via `tokio::fs` (atomic tmp-write + rename) so config persistence from axum handlers never blocks a Tokio worker thread. The `load_*` functions remain synchronous — they only run once at startup (`runtime/state.rs`), before the server accepts connections. Session data is **in-memory only** (lost on restart unless explicitly saved via `POST /admin/sessions/save`).

Storage files in `./storage/` (default):

```
routes.json, throttle.json, rewrites.json, breakpoints.json,
header_maps.json, modifications.json, hot_config.json,
capture_filter.json, dns_overrides.json, map_local.json,
upstream_proxy.json, webhooks.json, mock_rules.json, lua_scripts.json
```

### Configuration

Priority order: env vars > YAML (`OPROXY_CONFIG` → `./configs/default.yaml`) > defaults.

Key env vars: `OPROXY_PORT`, `OPROXY_BIND_HOST`, `OPROXY_MITM_ENABLED`, `OPROXY_STORAGE_PATH`, `OPROXY_LOG_LEVEL`, `RUST_LOG`, `OPROXY_MAP_LOCAL_BASE_PATH`.

`socks5_port` and `upstream_proxy` are config fields with no env var override — set via YAML or `POST /admin/upstream-proxy`.

`map_local_base_path` (via `OPROXY_MAP_LOCAL_BASE_PATH` env var) configures the base directory for Map Local fixture files in containerized deployments. When set, relative paths in rules are resolved from it; absolute paths still work for backward compatibility.

### Session data model

`Exchange` in `session/mod.rs` holds one captured request/response pair. Key fields:
- `request: RequestContext`, `response: Option<ResponseContext>`
- `metrics: Option<InspectionMetrics>` — latency, TTFB, body time, sizes; optional DNS/TCP/TLS breakdown
- `inspector_data: Option<InspectorData>` — JWT, GraphQL, gRPC parsed data (populated by inspector middlewares via InspectionMiddleware)
- `tags`, `note` — user annotations

`SessionManager` is an `RwLock<IndexMap<String, Exchange>>` with a cap-based eviction (oldest dropped when `max_sessions` is reached) and a `broadcast::Sender<()>` that fires on every change (SSE + webhook dispatcher).

### SOCKS5 listener

`transport/socks5.rs` implements RFC 1928 no-auth handshake. Integrated in `main.rs` when `config.socks5_port` is set — second `TcpListener` calls `transport::socks5::handshake()` then either `tunnel()` (plain TCP) or MITM path.

### Lua scripting

`middleware/plugins/lua_engine.rs` creates a fresh sandboxed `Lua` state per request (no shared state). Globals `io`, `os`, `package`, `require`, `load`, `loadfile`, `dofile`, `debug` are removed. Scripts interact via `request`/`response` table globals. `abort(status, body)` sets `x-oproxy-mock-response` and returns `StopAndReturn`. mlua uses `vendored` feature (bundles Lua 5.4 — no system Lua needed).

### Map Local (file mocking)

`middleware/plugins/map_local.rs` serves static fixture files for matching requests instead of forwarding upstream. Key details:

**Rule matching:** `MapLocalRule` uses full `Location`-based matching (host, path, method, protocol, query, mode). 

**Path resolution:**
- If `OPROXY_MAP_LOCAL_BASE_PATH` is set, relative paths are joined with it
- Absolute paths (starting with `/`) bypass the base path
- Backward compatible: existing deployments with absolute paths continue to work

**File vs directory:**
- **File mode:** serves the file's contents verbatim
- **Directory mode:** appends the request path and serves the result (with path-traversal checks)

**Validation:** 
- API layer (`control_plane/policy.rs`): `validate_map_local_path()` checks at rule creation time using the base path
- Returns 422 if file doesn't exist, with a helpful error message
- Runtime checks (middleware): 502 if the file/directory becomes inaccessible

**MIME detection:** `mime_for_path()` infers `Content-Type` from file extension (20+ types supported).

**Storage:** Rules persisted in `./storage/map_local_rules.json` by `storage.rs`.

**Docker pattern:** Set `OPROXY_MAP_LOCAL_BASE_PATH=/map-local` + `-v ./my-responses:/map-local`. Users then create rules with relative paths like `api/users.json`.

## UI

The current app shell is built from `src/design` with Vite. `management.rs` serves the built files from `src/design/dist` via `include_str!`, so clean Rust builds need those assets. `build.rs` generates them automatically when missing; Docker and GitHub workflows build the UI explicitly before compiling Rust.

The legacy static files under `src/index.html`, `src/app.css`, and `src/js/` are still present for older surfaces and compatibility, but `/` serves the built design app. The design app includes Sessions, Compose, Rules, Breakpoints, Mock, Lua, Inspectors, DNS, Capture Filter, Webhooks, Root CA, Map Local, and Settings surfaces.

## Web browsing & QA

For all web browsing, QA testing, and site dogfooding, use the `/browse` skill from **gstack** (installed at `~/.claude/skills/gstack`). Never use `mcp__claude-in-chrome__*` tools.

Available gstack skills:
- `/office-hours`, `/plan-ceo-review`, `/plan-eng-review`, `/plan-design-review`, `/design-consultation`, `/design-shotgun`, `/design-html`, `/review`, `/ship`, `/land-and-deploy`, `/canary`, `/benchmark`, `/browse`, `/connect-chrome`, `/qa`, `/qa-only`, `/design-review`, `/setup-browser-cookies`, `/setup-deploy`, `/setup-gbrain`, `/retro`, `/investigate`, `/document-release`, `/document-generate`, `/codex`, `/cso`, `/autoplan`, `/plan-devex-review`, `/devex-review`, `/careful`, `/freeze`, `/guard`, `/unfreeze`, `/gstack-upgrade`, `/learn`

## Skill routing

When the user's request matches an available skill, invoke it via the Skill tool. When in doubt, invoke the skill.

Key routing rules:
- Product ideas/brainstorming → invoke /office-hours
- Strategy/scope → invoke /plan-ceo-review
- Architecture → invoke /plan-eng-review
- Design system/plan review → invoke /design-consultation or /plan-design-review
- Full review pipeline → invoke /autoplan
- Bugs/errors → invoke /investigate
- QA/testing site behavior → invoke /qa or /qa-only
- Code review/diff check → invoke /review
- Visual polish → invoke /design-review
- Ship/deploy/PR → invoke /ship or /land-and-deploy
- Save progress → invoke /context-save
- Resume context → invoke /context-restore
- Author a backlog-ready spec/issue → invoke /spec
