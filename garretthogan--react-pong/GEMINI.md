# Cursor Directive Snippet (Paste into Cursor rules)
When generating or editing code:
1. Treat all **error** rules as mandatory constraints.
2. Prefer explicit enums/state machines over booleans or implicit state.
3. Always implement loading + error + success feedback for async work.
4. Provide undo/confirm for destructive actions.
5. Never ship user-facing text that is generic or blameful.

# Game Architecture Lint Rules (GAPR) — Cursor Ruleset
Version: 0.9
Scope: All gameplay and engine code (runtime), excluding platform adapters and third-party libs.

Legend:
- MUST: required
- SHOULD: strongly recommended
- MAY: optional
- VIOLATION: what to flag
- FIX: what Cursor should do

------------------------------------------------------------
0) PROJECT STRUCTURE / LAYERING
------------------------------------------------------------

GAPR-0001 (MUST) Layered boundaries
- Rule: Platform code MUST NOT be called from Game layer directly.
- Violation: gameplay classes importing platform modules (windowing, filesystem, sockets, audio device APIs).
- Fix: introduce Engine-facing interfaces/adapters (IInput, IAudio, IClock, INet, IStorage) and inject them.

GAPR-0002 (MUST) Engine is reusable, Game is disposable
- Rule: Engine layer MUST NOT depend on game-specific modules/assets.
- Violation: Engine code importing `Game/*`, hardcoding content IDs, or referencing gameplay enums.
- Fix: move logic to Game layer or parameterize via data/config.

GAPR-0003 (SHOULD) Keep platform thin
- Rule: Platform layer SHOULD only adapt OS/browser/console APIs into Engine interfaces.
- Violation: non-trivial gameplay logic in platform adapters.
- Fix: move logic to Engine/Game; keep adapters as translation only.

------------------------------------------------------------
1) TIME / UPDATE ORDER
------------------------------------------------------------

GAPR-0101 (MUST) Single authoritative simulation tick
- Rule: Gameplay simulation MUST run from one tick source (the Game Loop).
- Violation: ad-hoc timers that mutate gameplay state outside the loop.
- Fix: schedule via SimulationScheduler / EventQueue with tick timestamps.

GAPR-0102 (SHOULD) Fixed timestep for simulation
- Rule: Core simulation SHOULD use fixed dt steps; render MAY interpolate.
- Violation: dt-scaled physics/gameplay that changes outcomes with frame rate.
- Fix: move to fixed-step accumulator; store previous/current snapshots for interpolation.

GAPR-0103 (MUST) Stable system order
- Rule: Systems that depend on one another MUST have explicit ordering.
- Violation: implicit ordering via iteration order of maps/sets or registration order.
- Fix: define SystemPipeline stages (Input, Intent, Sim, Resolve, Post, RenderPrep).

------------------------------------------------------------
2) INPUT / ACTIONS
------------------------------------------------------------

GAPR-0201 (MUST) Input produces intent, not effects
- Rule: Raw input handlers MUST NOT directly change gameplay state.
- Violation: key/mouse/touch events mutating Player/World directly.
- Fix: map inputs to Command objects or Intent structs; enqueue for simulation.

GAPR-0202 (SHOULD) Commands are recordable
- Rule: Commands SHOULD be serializable (or at least loggable deterministically).
- Violation: Commands containing non-deterministic closures, pointers, or direct object refs.
- Fix: store EntityId + parameters; resolve targets at execution time.

GAPR-0203 (MUST) No polling gameplay in render/UI
- Rule: UI/render code MUST NOT run gameplay decisions.
- Violation: UI click handlers applying damage/spawning entities.
- Fix: UI emits Commands/Events, simulation consumes them.

------------------------------------------------------------
3) BEHAVIOR / MODES
------------------------------------------------------------

GAPR-0301 (MUST) Replace branchy mode logic with State
- Rule: If behavior depends on a mode with distinct rules, it MUST be a State machine.
- Violation: long if/else or switch on “mode/state” inside Update.
- Fix: extract states (IdleState, SprintState, ReloadState, etc.) with enter/exit/update hooks.

GAPR-0302 (SHOULD) Prevent state explosion
- Rule: State machines SHOULD be hierarchical or compositional when states multiply.
- Violation: N×M state combinations (e.g., MovementState × WeaponState) as monolith states.
- Fix: split into multiple orthogonal state machines or use tags/components.

------------------------------------------------------------
4) DATA / TYPES / CONTENT
------------------------------------------------------------

GAPR-0401 (MUST) Data-driven types for large taxonomies
- Rule: If you have many “kinds” of something, you MUST use Type Object / data tables.
- Violation: many subclasses differing only by stats/config.
- Fix: introduce `TypeId` referencing config; instances hold TypeId + runtime state.

GAPR-0402 (MUST) Flyweight shared resources
- Rule: Large immutable resources MUST be shared, not duplicated per instance.
- Violation: per-entity copies of meshes, animation clips, large config blobs.
- Fix: store shared resource handle; keep instance state minimal.

GAPR-0403 (SHOULD) Instance state stays hot & small
- Rule: Per-entity runtime data SHOULD be compact and cache-friendly.
- Violation: bloated entity structs with cold data accessed rarely.
- Fix: split cold data into separate components or resource records.

------------------------------------------------------------
5) ENTITY COMPOSITION
------------------------------------------------------------

GAPR-0501 (MUST) Prefer composition over inheritance
- Rule: New gameplay capabilities MUST be components unless truly “is-a” with strict invariants.
- Violation: deep inheritance trees for entities (Enemy -> RangedEnemy -> IceRangedEnemy…).
- Fix: replace subclasses with components: Movement, Combat, Inventory, AI, Effects.

GAPR-0502 (SHOULD) Systems operate on component sets
- Rule: Systems SHOULD iterate over contiguous component collections (or stable queries).
- Violation: entity-level virtual dispatch for per-frame behavior across thousands of entities.
- Fix: move logic to systems operating on arrays/queries.

------------------------------------------------------------
6) DECOUPLING / MESSAGING
------------------------------------------------------------

GAPR-0601 (MUST) Cross-system communication via events
- Rule: One subsystem MUST NOT directly call into unrelated subsystems for side-effects.
- Violation: CombatSystem directly calling UISystem, AudioSystem, AchievementSystem.
- Fix: emit events; consumers subscribe (Observer) or consume from EventQueue.

GAPR-0602 (MUST) Use EventQueue when timing/order matters
- Rule: If processing order/timing matters, events MUST be queued with timestamps/frame ids.
- Violation: immediate broadcast for events that must be resolved later (damage resolution, spawn).
- Fix: push into EventQueue; process in designated pipeline stage.

GAPR-0603 (SHOULD) Observer is for local immediacy
- Rule: Observer SHOULD be used for local reactions without ordering constraints (UI sync, counters).
- Violation: Observer used for authoritative gameplay resolution.
- Fix: swap to EventQueue for authoritative actions.

GAPR-0604 (MUST NOT) Service Locator abuse
- Rule: Service Locator MUST NOT become implicit global state for gameplay logic.
- Violation: gameplay code fetching services everywhere (Audio, RNG, Net) without injection.
- Fix: pass services explicitly to systems; keep locator limited to bootstrapping.

------------------------------------------------------------
7) PERFORMANCE / ALLOCATIONS
------------------------------------------------------------

GAPR-0701 (MUST) No per-frame allocations in hot paths
- Rule: Hot update loops MUST NOT allocate.
- Violation: new objects, string building, per-frame array growth.
- Fix: preallocate, use pools, reuse buffers, replace strings with ids.

GAPR-0702 (MUST) Object Pool transient objects
- Rule: High-churn objects MUST use Object Pooling (bullets, particles, decals, hit markers).
- Violation: spawn/destroy every frame via heap allocations.
- Fix: implement Pool<T> with acquire/release; reset state on release.

GAPR-0703 (SHOULD) Dirty Flag expensive recompute
- Rule: Expensive derived values SHOULD use Dirty Flags (transforms, bounds, UI layout).
- Violation: recalculating every frame regardless of changes.
- Fix: mark dirty on mutation; recompute lazily.

GAPR-0704 (SHOULD) Spatial partition for proximity queries
- Rule: Collision/visibility/proximity SHOULD use partitions when N is large.
- Violation: O(n^2) naive distance checks.
- Fix: grid / quadtree / BVH; update membership when moving.

GAPR-0705 (MAY) Data locality refactor for top hotspots
- Rule: If profiling shows cache misses, MAY refactor to SoA / packed arrays.
- Violation: pointer-chasing in inner loops with measurable cost.
- Fix: move hot components to contiguous arrays; minimize indirection.

------------------------------------------------------------
8) DETERMINISM / NETWORK / REPLAY (IF APPLICABLE)
------------------------------------------------------------

GAPR-0801 (MUST) Deterministic simulation inputs
- Rule: If replay/netcode is needed, simulation MUST be driven by Commands/Intents + fixed tick ids.
- Violation: reading realtime clock or random without controlled seed in gameplay.
- Fix: use seeded RNG service; record input stream with tick index.

GAPR-0802 (SHOULD) Separate authoritative vs presentation
- Rule: Presentation effects SHOULD be derived from authoritative events, not drive them.
- Violation: particles/sounds driving gameplay outcomes.
- Fix: gameplay emits event; presentation consumes.

------------------------------------------------------------
9) CODE SMELL FLAGS (QUICK HEURISTICS)
------------------------------------------------------------

GAPR-0901 (FLAG) “Manager” classes doing everything
- Smell: God objects (GameManager, WorldManager, EntityManager) with mixed responsibilities.
- Fix: split into systems; define clear ownership.

GAPR-0902 (FLAG) Switch on type enum to emulate polymorphism
- Smell: `switch(type)` repeated across systems.
- Fix: Type Object data or component composition; move decisions into data tables.

GAPR-0903 (FLAG) Hidden ordering dependence
- Smell: bugs caused by “this must run before that” but not enforced.
- Fix: pipeline stages + explicit dependencies.

------------------------------------------------------------
10) AUTOFIX PLAYBOOK (WHAT CURSOR SHOULD DO)
------------------------------------------------------------

When a violation is found, Cursor should:
1) Identify layer boundary breach, propose interface/injection.
2) Replace direct side-effect calls across systems with EventQueue event emission + subscriber.
3) Extract branchy mode logic into State objects, add enter/exit hooks.
4) Convert repeated spawn/destroy to Pool<T>.
5) Move per-frame allocations to reused buffers; convert strings to ids.
6) Introduce TypeId + config records when taxonomy grows.
7) Add dirty flags for expensive derived properties.
8) Add spatial partition for repeated proximity queries.

------------------------------------------------------------------

# CLEAN CODE LINT CONTRACT (Cursor)
Version: 1.0  
Purpose: Enforce readability, maintainability, low cognitive load, and safe evolution of code.

**Enforcement**
- **ERROR**: Must fix before merge.
- **WARN**: Fix unless there is a strong, explicit justification.
- **INFO**: Guideline / reinforcement.

**How Cursor should use this**
- When writing or refactoring code: eliminate **ERROR** violations first, then reduce **WARN** violations.
- Prefer refactoring over comments.
- Prefer clarity over cleverness.
- Optimize for future readers.

---

## Severity Legend

- **ERROR** = Must fix
- **WARN** = Should fix
- **INFO** = Nice to have

---

# 1) Naming

### CC-NAME-001 (ERROR) — Intention-revealing identifiers
**Rule:** Names must clearly communicate purpose and behavior.  
**Ban/avoid:** `data`, `info`, `obj`, `thing`, `tmp`, `manager`, `handler`, `system` (unless narrowly correct and justified).  
**Fix:** Rename until intent is obvious (`retryPolicy`, `serializeFrame`, `userSession`).

### CC-NAME-002 (WARN) — No misleading names
**Rule:** Names must reflect type/units/behavior.  
**Fix:** Include units and specificity (`timeoutMs`, `elapsedSeconds`, `userId` not `id`).

### CC-NAME-003 (WARN) — Avoid non-standard abbreviations
**Rule:** Only use abbreviations that are domain-standard (HTTP, UI, FPS, CPU).  
**Fix:** Expand or document a local glossary.

### CC-NAME-004 (WARN) — Searchable names outside tiny scopes
**Rule:** Single-letter variables allowed only for tight loops (<10 LOC) or well-known math contexts.  
**Fix:** Use searchable names (`playerIndex`, `hitCount`, `transform`).

### CC-NAME-005 (WARN) — Consistent vocabulary
**Rule:** Don’t mix synonyms for the same concept in the same module (`fetch/get/load/retrieve`).  
**Fix:** Pick one verb per concept and standardize.

### CC-NAME-006 (WARN) — No “noise words”
**Rule:** Avoid meaningless suffixes/prefixes (`Object`, `Thing`, `Info`, `_data`).  
**Fix:** Remove noise; choose a precise noun/verb.

---

# 2) Functions

### CC-FUNC-001 (ERROR) — Single responsibility (do one thing)
**Rule:** A function must do one thing. If it has multiple conceptual phases, extract helpers.  
**Smells:** parsing + validation + persistence in one function; multiple “and then” steps; multiple blank-line “chapters.”  
**Fix:** Extract `parseX`, `validateX`, `buildX`, `persistX`.

### CC-FUNC-002 (ERROR) — One level of abstraction
**Rule:** Don’t mix high-level orchestration with low-level details.  
**Fix:** Move low-level operations to helpers; keep top-level function readable.

### CC-FUNC-003 (WARN) — Function size limits
**Rule:** Functions should be small.  
**Defaults:** WARN > 20 LOC; ERROR > 50 LOC (excluding blank lines and comments).  
**Fix:** Extract, simplify control flow, use guard clauses.

### CC-FUNC-004 (ERROR) — No flag arguments
**Rule:** Don’t pass booleans/enums that change function behavior significantly.  
**Fix:** Split into separate functions or use strategy/polymorphism.

### CC-FUNC-005 (WARN) — Limit argument count
**Rule:** Prefer 0–2 args.  
**Defaults:** WARN at 3+ args; ERROR at 5+ args.  
**Fix:** Introduce parameter object/config struct; split responsibilities.

### CC-FUNC-006 (ERROR) — No output parameters / inout mutation
**Rule:** Don’t return results by mutating arguments (exceptions only for clearly named, performance-critical inner loops).  
**Fix:** Return a value/struct/result type.

### CC-FUNC-007 (ERROR) — Avoid hidden side effects
**Rule:** Function names must reflect side effects (I/O, persistence, mutation, global state).  
**Fix:** Rename to reveal side effect (`saveX`, `loadX`, `mutateX`) or refactor side effects out.

---

# 3) Control Flow

### CC-CFLOW-001 (WARN) — Limit nesting depth
**Rule:** Avoid deep nesting.  
**Defaults:** WARN > 2; ERROR > 4.  
**Fix:** Guard clauses (early return), extract predicate methods.

### CC-CFLOW-002 (WARN) — Extract complex conditionals
**Rule:** Conditionals with more than 2 boolean operators must be extracted to named predicates.  
**Fix:** `if (isExpired(user) && isAuthorized(user))`

### CC-CFLOW-003 (WARN) — Switch statements are a smell
**Rule:** Repeated switches on type/state suggest missing polymorphism/dispatch.  
**Fix:** Replace with strategy, dispatch table, or polymorphic methods; isolate a single switch at the boundary if needed.

---

# 4) Comments

### CC-COMM-001 (ERROR) — No redundant comments
**Rule:** Comments that restate code are banned.  
**Fix:** Delete comment; improve naming and structure.

### CC-COMM-002 (WARN) — Comments explain WHY (not WHAT)
**Rule:** Comments should explain rationale, constraints, tradeoffs, consequences, or API limitations.  
**Fix:** Rewrite comment to capture intent and reasoning.

### CC-COMM-003 (ERROR) — No commented-out code
**Rule:** Dead code must be removed; rely on version control.  
**Fix:** Delete.

---

# 5) Formatting & Structure

### CC-FMT-001 (ERROR) — Use and obey an auto-formatter
**Rule:** Code must match project formatting rules (formatter is source of truth).  
**Fix:** Run formatter locally + in CI.

### CC-FMT-002 (WARN) — Vertical locality
**Rule:** Keep related concepts colocated; don’t scatter helpers across files.  
**Fix:** Move helpers near their primary caller or into a cohesive private section.

### CC-FMT-003 (WARN) — Meaningful whitespace
**Rule:** Use blank lines to separate conceptual blocks; avoid dense “wall of code.”  
**Fix:** Split into paragraphs; extract helpers.

---

# 6) Error Handling

### CC-ERR-001 (ERROR) — Don’t return null for failure
**Rule:** Use exceptions, `Result<T>`, `Optional<T>`, or language-idiomatic error types.  
**Fix:** Replace nulls with typed failure.

### CC-ERR-002 (ERROR) — Don’t use error codes for flow control
**Rule:** Avoid sentinel values (`-1`, `0`, `false`) representing failure unless domain-native and explicit.  
**Fix:** Use typed errors / exceptions / result types.

### CC-ERR-003 (WARN) — Keep happy-path dominant
**Rule:** Main logic must be visually prominent; error handling must not obscure it.  
**Fix:** Guard clauses; narrow try/catch blocks.

### CC-ERR-004 (WARN) — Wrap external errors at boundaries
**Rule:** Do not leak third-party exceptions across domain boundaries.  
**Fix:** Translate to domain-level errors in adapters.

---

# 7) Classes & OO Design

### CC-CLASS-001 (ERROR) — Single Responsibility Principle
**Rule:** A class should have one reason to change.  
**Smells:** names like `Manager`, `System`, `Processor` without clear scope; multiple unrelated responsibilities.  
**Fix:** Split by responsibility.

### CC-CLASS-002 (WARN) — High cohesion
**Rule:** If many fields are used by only some methods, cohesion is low.  
**Fix:** Extract a new class; reduce shared mutable state.

### CC-CLASS-003 (WARN) — Minimal public surface
**Rule:** Default to private; expose the smallest stable API.  
**Fix:** Encapsulate; avoid getter/setter sprawl.

### CC-OO-001 (WARN) — Law of Demeter (no “train wrecks”)
**Rule:** Avoid long chains of calls (`a.b().c().d`).  
**Fix:** Add methods to the right abstraction; pass required objects explicitly.

---

# 8) Data & Duplication

### CC-DUP-001 (ERROR) — No copy-paste duplication
**Rule:** Duplicate or near-duplicate blocks must be factored.  
**Default:** ERROR if ~6+ lines duplicated.  
**Fix:** Extract function; parameterize differences.

### CC-DATA-001 (WARN) — No magic numbers/strings
**Rule:** Literals with domain meaning must be named constants.  
**Fix:** Replace with `const` / enums / configuration values.

### CC-DATA-002 (WARN) — Avoid primitive obsession
**Rule:** Don’t represent domain concepts as raw primitives (IDs, units, states).  
**Fix:** Introduce value types (`UserId`, `Seconds`, `HealthPoints`) or constrained wrappers.

---

# 9) Boundaries & Dependencies

### CC-BOUND-001 (WARN) — Wrap third-party libraries
**Rule:** External APIs should not leak into domain logic; wrap behind internal interfaces.  
**Fix:** Adapter layer mapping external types to domain types.

### CC-BOUND-002 (WARN) — Dependency direction
**Rule:** Domain must not depend on UI/framework/infrastructure.  
**Fix:** Invert dependencies with interfaces; keep boundaries explicit.

---

# 10) Tests

### CC-TEST-001 (ERROR) — New behavior requires tests
**Rule:** Any new behavior must include tests unless explicitly exempted.  
**Fix:** Add unit/integration tests appropriate to the change.

### CC-TEST-002 (WARN) — FIRST principles
**Rule:** Tests must be Fast, Independent, Repeatable, Self-validating, Timely.  
**Fix:** Remove shared state; eliminate nondeterminism; avoid network/time.

### CC-TEST-003 (WARN) — One concept per test
**Rule:** Each test should validate one behavior.  
**Fix:** Split tests; reduce assertion scope.

### CC-TEST-004 (WARN) — Avoid logic in tests
**Rule:** Avoid loops/conditionals in tests beyond table-driven patterns.  
**Fix:** Parameterize tests; keep intent obvious.

---

# Enforcement Defaults (Recommended)

- Function length: WARN > 20 LOC; ERROR > 50 LOC
- Nesting depth: WARN > 2; ERROR > 4
- Parameter count: WARN >= 3; ERROR >= 5
- Duplication: ERROR if ~6+ lines duplicated
- Predicate complexity: WARN if boolean ops > 2

---

# Cursor Refactoring Protocol

When generating or refactoring code:

1. Remove **ERROR** violations first.
2. Reduce **WARN** violations next.
3. Refactor instead of adding comments that explain WHAT.
4. Keep happy-path logic prominent.
5. Standardize naming and vocabulary within modules.
6. Create small functions and cohesive classes.
7. Introduce boundaries to isolate third-party APIs and infrastructure.
8. Add/update tests for new or changed behavior.

If tradeoffs are necessary, state them explicitly and localize the compromise.

# META DIRECTIVE

When generating or modifying code:

- Every user-facing feature MUST pass this lint.
- Every engagement mechanic MUST map to the Hook Loop.
- Reject implementations that violate loop closure or lack internal trigger clarity.

---

# CORE LOOP DEFINITION

All engagement systems MUST implement:

Trigger → Action → Variable Reward → Investment → Next Trigger

Loop must be closed and repeatable.

---

# SECTION 1 — TRIGGER RULES

## H001 — Internal Trigger Required
FAIL if feature depends solely on external notifications.

REQUIRE:
- Define PrimaryInternalTrigger
- Map to recurring emotional state
- Occurs multiple times per week

Examples:
- boredom
- uncertainty
- anxiety
- curiosity tension
- social comparison

---

## H002 — Trigger–Relief Mapping
Each trigger must resolve a discomfort.

REQUIRE:
Trigger → Action → Emotional Relief

If relief is unclear, reject feature.

---

## H003 — External Trigger Decay
External prompts must decrease over time.

System must evolve toward:
- Internal trigger recall
- Habitual recall without prompt

---

# SECTION 2 — ACTION RULES

## H101 — Atomic Core Action
Core engagement must be:

- One clear interaction
- Minimal cognitive load
- Immediate system response

Reject multi-step friction chains before reward.

---

## H102 — Ability Over Motivation
If motivation is unknown or low:

- Reduce required steps
- Remove optional fields
- Eliminate blocking UI

Behavior = Motivation × Ability × Prompt  
Optimize Ability first.

---

## H103 — No Dead Interactions
Every action must:

- Change system state
- Reveal new information
- Advance progress
- Trigger reward pathway

Reject UI actions that produce no state transition.

---

# SECTION 3 — VARIABLE REWARD RULES

## H201 — Reward Variability Required
Static rewards are prohibited.

Each reward must include:
- Uncertainty
- Social variance
- Content unpredictability
- Progress variability

---

## H202 — Reward Classification
Each reward must map to one of:

- Tribe (social validation)
- Hunt (information/resource gain)
- Self (mastery/progression)

Reject rewards that do not clearly fit one category.

---

## H203 — Anticipation Gap
Anticipation must exceed consumption.

System must:
- Tease outcome
- Delay certainty
- Encourage checking behavior

---

## H204 — Feed Determinism Check
If feature includes a content stream:

- Must not be fully deterministic
- Must include dynamic user-influenced variance

Reject static chronological-only feeds without engagement hooks.

---

# SECTION 4 — INVESTMENT RULES

## H301 — Durable User Input Required
User must invest:

- Data
- Preferences
- Social graph
- Content
- Progress

Reject features where user effort does not persist.

---

## H302 — Investment Loads Next Trigger
Investment must generate future engagement stimulus.

Example:
User posts → responses → notification → return

Reject investments that do not create future trigger potential.

---

## H303 — Compounding Value Requirement
UserValue(t+1) > UserValue(t)

System must increase:
- Personalization
- Stored progress
- Switching cost
- Identity integration

Reject reset-heavy designs without accumulation.

---

# SECTION 5 — LOOP VALIDATION

## H401 — Full Loop Enforcement
Feature MUST define:

- Trigger
- Action
- Variable Reward
- Investment
- Next Trigger

Reject partial loops.

---

## H402 — Time-to-Reward Constraint
Time between Action and Reward should be:

< 3 seconds (ideal)

If longer:
- Provide visible progress signals
- Show advancement indicators

---

## H403 — Frequency Over Intensity
Optimize for repetition, not spectacle.

HabitStrength ∝ RepetitionCount  
NOT EmotionalSpike

Reject designs that rely on rare high-intensity events only.

---

# SECTION 6 — HABIT FORMATION TEST

## H501 — Notification Independence Test
Ask:

Would user return without push notification?

If no → habit not formed.

---

## H502 — Identity Integration Check
Feature should trend toward:

- Routine embedding
- Default behavior
- Identity reinforcement

Example:
"I check this every morning"

Reject purely novelty-driven features.

---

# SECTION 7 — ETHICAL VALIDATION

Before implementation:

- Would I use this?
- Does this improve user life?
- Would I recommend this to someone I care about?

If any answer is no → flag for review.

---

# FEATURE DESIGN TEMPLATE

When generating new feature code, require:

InternalTrigger:
CoreAction:
VariableReward(type):
InvestmentMechanic:
NextTrigger:
RepetitionFrequency:
CompoundingValue:
EthicalValidation:

If any field is undefined → reject implementation.

---

# ENGINEERING INTEGRATION DIRECTIVE

When writing code:

- Annotate loop stages in comments
- Explicitly mark reward variability logic
- Track investment persistence
- Measure repeat usage frequency
- Validate compounding value growth

If behavioral loop cannot be identified in implementation,
refactor before merge.
