# AGENTS.md — deploy (DigitalOcean + Compose)

Operator/agent contract for staging and prod. Full procedures live in [`README.md`](README.md); do not duplicate them here.

## Topology (4 droplets, NYC1)

| Host | Role | Gateway |
|------|------|---------|
| `base-staging` | staging master | yes (`role-master` + `env-staging`) |
| `base-staging-validator` | staging validator | no — VPC → staging master `:8080` |
| `base-prod` | prod master | yes (`role-master` + `env-prod`) |
| `base-prod-validator` | prod validator | no — VPC → prod master `:8080` |

Terraform: [`terraform/`](terraform/). Firewall: SSH from operator IP; CI uses ephemeral `/32` via `.github/actions/do-firewall` (always tear down). Spaces for Postgres backups (promote/restore).

## Compose matrix

`remote-deploy.sh --env staging|prod --role master|validator` stacks:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `compose/role-master.yml` | gateway profile, VPC publish; **no validator** (avoids dual CRV4 submit) |
| `compose/role-validator.yml` | no gateway; external gateway endpoint; sole on-chain submitter |
| `compose/env-staging.yml` | testnet 541, faster coordination |
| `compose/env-prod.yml` | mainnet, conservative intervals |
| `compose/env-local.yml` | **local only** — ports/smoke knobs/tunnel env; always on top of `env-staging` |

Verify: `./deploy/scripts/assert-compose-matrix.sh`.  
Root `docker-compose.staging-*.yml` overrides are **obsolete** — use `deploy/compose/` only.  
`remote-deploy.sh` never selects `env-local*.yml`.

## Postgres vs ephemeral state

Compose always runs a digest-pinned `postgres` service (`base-pgdata` volume, healthcheck, `deploy/env/postgres.env`). App `BASE_DATABASE_URL` must match that file (materialize via `./deploy/scripts/materialize-env.sh`; local-e2e also injects `LOCAL_DATABASE_URL` from it).

| Data | Store |
|------|--------|
| Design harnesses / runs / stages / artifacts metadata / admin rounds | **Postgres** (`design_*`) |
| Prism submissions / stage events | **Postgres** (`prism_*`) |
| Gateway raw weight leaves + sealed bundles | **Postgres** (`raw_weight_snapshot`, `epoch_bundle`, …) |
| Validator attestations (when DB configured) | **Postgres** |
| Design sandbox staging files | volume `${BASE_STATE_DIR}/design/staging` + `design-artifacts` |
| Gateway challenge **backend registry** | **in-memory** — re-seed after gateway restart (`remote-deploy.sh` does this on master) |
| site-api (`GET /v1/site/*`) | no DB — proxies challenge upstreams via gateway |
| Unit/integration tests | may construct `Memory*Store` directly; omit `BASE_DATABASE_URL` only there |

Migrations (`crates/db/migrations`) run on boot in gateway / design-challenge / prism-challenge when `BASE_DATABASE_URL` is set. Compose requires `deploy/env/{design,prism}-challenge.env` so challenges cannot silently boot on memory.

Verify rows (local master stack):

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml exec -T postgres \
  sh -c 'psql -U "$POSTGRES_USER" -d "$POSTGRES_DB" -c \
  "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM design_harness; SELECT COUNT(*) FROM prism_submission;"'
```

## Local testnet E2E

Full procedure: [`docs/runbooks/local-testnet-e2e.md`](../docs/runbooks/local-testnet-e2e.md).

```bash
./deploy/scripts/materialize-env.sh
./deploy/scripts/local-e2e.sh --dry-run          # plan + compose render
./deploy/scripts/local-e2e.sh --smoke            # healthz + weights seal smoke + tunnel
./deploy/scripts/local-e2e.sh --live             # owner wallet + REQUIRE_OWNER=1
./deploy/scripts/local-e2e.sh --down
```

| Prereq | smoke | live |
|--------|-------|------|
| Docker, Compose v2 | yes | yes |
| `cloudflared` (or `--no-tunnel`) | yes | yes |
| `deploy/env/*.env` (examples OK) | yes | yes |
| `gateway_sk` (seal) + `prism_sk` / `design_sk` (leaf sigs; pubs ↔ trust root) | yes (prefer `~/.base-secrets/challenge-*.sk`) | real preferred |
| `deploy/secrets/wallets/base-owner` | **no** (not needed for `/v1/weights/latest`) | **yes** (netuid 541 owner) |
| `base-validator` wallet | **no** (fetch-only) | for on-chain weight submit |
| Fresh `target/release/{gateway,validator,…}` (or `BASE_DOCKER_BUILD_FROM=source`) | recommended | **required** for real chain |

**Weights seal smoke (default on `--smoke`):** after healthz, `local-e2e.sh` runs `weights-smoke` — signed prism leaves for the live metagraph → `POST /v1/admin/seal` → assert `GET /v1/weights/latest` is **200** with **`sealed: true`**. Skip with `--no-weights-smoke`. Pre-seal, latest is **200 burn** (`sealed: false`, uid 0 = 100%) — never 404; that is unrelated to a missing gateway owner wallet. Prefer `--burn` on mainnet when sealing without real challenge scores (all `NoScore` → uid 0).

**Interim prod burn seal (until prism auto-emits):** keep a fresh sealed bundle on the master gateway so validators can Match + CRV4 submit. On the prod master this runs as a **systemd timer** (`base-burn-seal.timer`, every 21 min — above the 100-block `WeightsSetRateLimit`, inside the ~256-block Finney state-pruning window) driving [`scripts/prod-burn-seal.sh`](scripts/prod-burn-seal.sh); units live in [`systemd/`](systemd/). Install:

```bash
install -m 0755 target/release/weights-smoke /opt/base/bin/weights-smoke
install -m 0755 deploy/scripts/prod-burn-seal.sh /opt/base/deploy/scripts/prod-burn-seal.sh
install -m 0644 deploy/systemd/base-burn-seal.{service,timer} /etc/systemd/system/
systemctl daemon-reload && systemctl enable --now base-burn-seal.timer
```

Manual one-shot (from an operator host with secrets) is still:

```bash
cargo run -q --release -p weights-smoke -- \
  --gateway https://chain.joinbase.ai --burn
```

A seal older than ~256 blocks can never be verified by the validator (public RPC prunes state) — if `GET /v1/weights/latest` shows `metagraph_block` lagging tip by thousands of blocks, check `systemctl status base-burn-seal.timer` and `/var/log/base-burn-seal.log` on the master.

**Real-epoch sealer (post burn-seal retirement):** `base-real-seal.timer` (every 10 min) drives [`scripts/prod-real-seal.sh`](scripts/prod-real-seal.sh), which seals the **current chain epoch** with `block_b = LastEpochBlock` (the epoch's start block — exactly the metagraph both challenges pin their leaf sets against, so D24 participant matching holds by construction). The attempt 409s until both challenges have emitted for that epoch; that is the expected steady state. The gateway prefers chain-scale bundles over the reserved smoke range (`>= 8_000_000`), so once a real seal lands it outranks every interim burn bundle — retire the burn timer (`systemctl disable --now base-burn-seal.timer`) after the first real seal verifies end-to-end. Install:

```bash
install -m 0755 deploy/scripts/prod-real-seal.sh /opt/base/deploy/scripts/prod-real-seal.sh
install -m 0644 deploy/systemd/base-real-seal.{service,timer} /etc/systemd/system/
systemctl daemon-reload && systemctl enable --now base-real-seal.timer
```

## Chain endpoint failover (`BASE_CHAIN_ENDPOINTS`)

Public Finney RPCs rate-limit per source IP (entrypoint-finney: HTTP 429 `http_60s` policy, or HTTP 200 with `"Too many requests from this source."`). Every Rust consumer (gateway, validator, both challenges, `weights-smoke`) goes through `chain-live`, which accepts an **ordered comma-separated endpoint list** and cools a faulted endpoint (429 / `-32005` / transport error) for 60s before retrying it; request-level JSON-RPC errors never fail over.

| Knob | Where | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| `BASE_CHAIN_ENDPOINTS` | compose `env-*.yml` / host `deploy/env/*.env` | Ordered list, primary first. **Wins over** `BASE_CHAIN_ENDPOINT`; the singular var is the fallback. |
| `BASE_CHAIN_ENDPOINT` | same | Single endpoint; also accepts a comma list (legacy path). |
| Cooldown | — | Fixed 60s in `chain-live` (matches the Finney `retry_after_seconds: 60`). |

Prod (`env-prod.yml` + `base-burn-seal.service`): onfinality `public-ws` primary, entrypoint-finney fallback — entrypoint hard-429'd the prod master IP for ~3h on 2026-08-06 while onfinality only burst-429'd boot/submit spikes (free tier), which failover absorbed with zero seal/submit impact. Keep onfinality primary while entrypoint's per-IP standing is suspect — a 2026-08-07 flip-back attempt reverted within ~15 min: solo probes from the host were clean (15/15 HTTP 200 over ~2 min incl. a rapid burst) but full service load re-tripped entrypoint's http_60s budget (boot/submit storm ~385 faults over 4 min, then sustained ~1-2/min cooled-retry 429s), all absorbed by failover with zero tick/seal/submit impact. If onfinality's burst limits start failing whole ticks, flip the order (both directions are exercised in prod logs). Probe from the host: `curl -X POST -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"chain_getHeader","params":[]}' https://entrypoint-finney.opentensor.ai:443`. Failover events surface as `chain endpoint fault; failing over` WARN lines in service logs. Staging (`env-staging.yml`): each service keeps its current primary and gains the other testnet host as fallback (validator: test.finney→test.chain; gateway/challenges: reverse).

**On-chain WeightsSetRateLimit vs smoke:** validators fail fast with `RateLimited` *before* pool-submitting when the hotkey is inside its 100-block window (no doomed extrinsic, no ~45s confirm block of the async runtime). Previously a restart inside the window re-stormed every tick and wedged `/healthz` past the healthcheck's retry budget — the staging validator smoke failure mode. A validator that logs `weights rate limited; retry after N blocks` immediately after a Match is inside the window, not broken; it submits when the window opens.

Validator logs should show `Match epoch=` then `Match → submit_intent` / `submit_timelocked ok`. Keep legacy Python weight submit **stopped** to avoid double-commit.

**Sole on-chain submitter (mainnet hotkey `5Gzi…`):** Rust `base-validator-1` on **`base-prod-validator` (`192.81.218.11`) only**. `role-master.yml` profiles the validator under `never`; `remote-deploy.sh --role master` force-removes any leftover container. Do **not** run a second validator (or Python weight submitter) with the same wallet — dual submitters fight `WeightsSetRateLimit` and can leave CRV4 commits stuck while incentive still shows a prior monopoly UID.

**Legacy Python agents (mainnet):** `validator-5gzi` (`95.133.252.120`) may point `master_url` / `weights_url` / `registry_url` at `https://chain.joinbase.ai` with **`submit_on_chain_enabled: false`**. Coordination shims live in `gateway-compat` (`/v1/validators/*`, `/v1/registry`, empty assignments). `GET /v1/weights/latest` refreshes `computed_at` / `expires_at` at serve time so Python pydantic clients accept sealed vectors older than 720s. Do **not** start `base-weight-submitter-5gzi` on `validator-root` unless CR ownership is moved off Rust.

**Challenge verification:** on **master** only (validator has **no challenge exec**). Simulate submissions end-to-end — submit **baseline** + submit **cheat**, poll `/v1/runs/{id}` + `/events` + `/logs`, probe edges (bad harness, sanitize, quota, routes), then **admin winners** (`GET/POST /v1/admin/rounds/{id}/…` with bearer from `deploy/secrets/design/annotator_tokens`) and confirm leaf → seal → `GET /v1/weights/latest` **`sealed: true`**. **Never host Sim in staging/prod** (`BASE_ALLOW_HOST_SIM` / host `SimSandbox` are CI/local only). Healthz alone is insufficient.

Tunnel writes gitignored `deploy/env/local-tunnel.env` (`BASE_GATEWAY_PUBLIC_URL`). Co-located validator stays on `http://gateway:8080`; external clients use the tunnel URL. Host probe ports default to `2808x` (avoid staging SSH on `1808x`).

## CI: staging vs prod

| Lane | Trigger | Build stance |
|------|---------|--------------|
| Staging | CI green on `main` (`deploy-staging.yml`) | `--build-from source` on droplet OK for iteration |
| Images | Push to `main` (`images.yml`) | Build/push GHCR digests; promote + **commit** `deploy/pins/staging.json` + `deploy/digests/<sha>.json` |
| Prod | Tag `v*.*.*` (`deploy-prod.yml`) | **`--build-from registry` only** — promote staging→prod pins, pull GHCR digests; no Rust source build on prod hosts |

Ladder: CI → GHCR digests → `deploy/pins/staging.json` (committed by `images.yml`) → tag → preflight (CI + staging pins match tag SHA) → `promote.sh` → `remote-deploy.sh --build-from registry`. Details: [`README.md`](README.md) § Auto CI deploy and § Promotion pipeline.

## Secrets / age

- Identity OOB on host: `/etc/base/age-identity.txt` (or `AGE_IDENTITY`) — never in Terraform/cloud-init.
- Materialize: `./deploy/scripts/materialize-env.sh` → `deploy/env/*.env` mode **0600**.
- Runtime secret files (wallets, keys): mode **0400**, owner **uid 65532**.
- Helpers: `age-encrypt-env.sh`, `age-push-env.sh`. Checklist: [`docs/OPERATOR_SECURITY.md`](../docs/OPERATOR_SECURITY.md).

## First prod tag checklist

1. Staging healthy on the exact commit you will tag; `deploy/pins/staging.json` `commit_sha` matches that SHA.
2. Digests recorded / promoted for services you will ship (`promote.sh`, `verify-task-43.sh` locally if needed).
3. Age identity + env ages present on both prod hosts; wallets hotkeys under `deploy/secrets/wallets/` (0400 / 65532).
4. Mainnet owner wallet placed; set `BASE_GATEWAY_REQUIRE_OWNER=1` when ready (ops gap until then — see [`docs/COMPLETENESS.md`](../docs/COMPLETENESS.md)).
5. Cut `vX.Y.Z` on `main`, push tag; pass `deploy-prod` preflight + `environment: production` reviewers.
6. Smoke `/healthz` on both prod hosts; confirm `evil-gateway` absent.

## Out of scope for agents (ops)

- DO Spaces backup credentials — set in GitHub (repo + `production` env): `BASE_BACKUP_ENDPOINT`, `SPACES_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `SPACES_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `BASE_BACKUP_BUCKET` (bucket `base-intelligence-backups` in nyc3; name `base-backups` was globally taken). Prod promote dumps Postgres over SSH then uploads from the runner (`deploy-prod.yml`).
- GitHub `production` environment required reviewers / `main` branch protection
- Gateway in-process TLS ACME (task 42 / `rustls-acme`) — **interim:** prod `chain.joinbase.ai` HTTPS via host Caddy on `:443` (TLS-ALPN-01) → `127.0.0.1:8080`; cleartext `:80` still docker→gateway
- Terraform remote state backend (recommended, not blocking app deploy)
- Bootstrap of age/secrets on brand-new droplets (OOB)
