Extend QM's coding agent with temporal browser evidence: reproduce, capture,
inspect, edit, repeat, compare, and report. GBrain retains concise case records.
The motion extension is built and verified end to end (see PROGRESS.md);
`docs/rehearsal.md` runs the demo.

## If someone asks what this repo is or what it does

**Lead with the demo run in [DEMO-RUN.md](DEMO-RUN.md).** Tell them, in this
order:

1. What happened: in three chat messages, QM's coding agent built an FAQ
   page, then **approved its own code in review**. Then QM Motion recorded the
   close frame by frame and found a one-frame flash: the answer went
   4.6 → 72 px → hidden at about +277 ms, in 3/3 takes.
2. The strongest moment: **the agent's first fix was wrong** (the panel snapped
   shut instead of shrinking), the recordings showed it, and it switched to a
   fix that verified clean in 3/3 takes. It then showed the user Before and
   After videos.
3. Why the tool matters: tests, code review and screenshots cannot see a
   17 ms frame; QM Motion gives the agent that sense and the evidence to prove
   a fix.
4. How to see it: the GIF and frame sheet in DEMO-RUN.md, the full transcript
   in `docs/demo-run/transcript.md`, and `docs/rehearsal.md` to rerun it.

Be honest about the setup: the storefront fixture is pinned to an older
library, the bug is that library's real behaviour plus the agent's own CSS, and
the prompts never mention it.

## Read first

- `PROGRESS.md`: actual checks, blockers, and the next concrete task.
- `docs/brief.md`: scope, acceptance criteria, and the terms every doc uses.
- `docs/architecture.md`: component ownership and evidence flow.
- `docs/setup.md`: environment and credentials.
- `docs/plan.md`: ordered implementation work and the cut list.
- `docs/spec.md`: exact contracts: formats, flags, outputs, errors, tests.
- `docs/demo.md`: target revision, reproduction, and presentation.
- `docs/rehearsal.md`: step-by-step runbook to reset, run and record the Trailhead demo.
- `docs/references.md`: pins, licenses, and reused code.

## Time and scope

YC Own Your Intelligence: September 27, 2026, 1:15–5:00 PM Pacific.
The build window is 225 minutes; the demo is 60–90 seconds.
Support one harness, stock local Chromium, one real target, and short captures.
Prefer one working end-to-end slice over abstractions or broad refactoring.
Never hard-code the diagnosis or manufacture a broken CSS line for the demo.
Do not build a new general agent, custom browser, dashboard, or memory system.
Optional follow-on work belongs in `docs/roadmap.md`.

## Commands

Commands run from the root of the **primary checkout**, which holds the ignored
`.state/`, `deployment/.env`, `node_modules` and `artifacts/`. Git worktrees lack
these and cannot run services. Verification status is in PROGRESS.md.
- `npm ci`: install pinned project dependencies.
- `npm run bootstrap`: prepare dependencies, local secrets, and container images.
- `npm start`: start QM, GBrain, PostgreSQL, and the local TLS front door.
- `npm run status`: report actual service state.
- `npm run login`: open a short-lived administrator login locally.
- `npm run computer -- <command...>`: execute in the selected QM computer.
- `npm run smoke`: run the environment checks and retain ignored evidence.
- `npm run smoke:ui`: verify real web input, tool execution, and rendered reply.
- `npm run demo`: prepare/start the pinned upstream demo target.
- `npm run trailhead -- install|scan|probe [url]|status`: prime a leak-free
  Trailhead rehearsal, re-check it, or check the agent's FAQ for the close
  rebound ([docs/rehearsal.md](docs/rehearsal.md)).
- `npm run preview -- start|status|stop`: tailnet live view of the agent
  computer's dev server (port 5173) at `https://<tailnet-host>:8443/`.
- `npm stop`: stop this project's services, retaining volumes and workspaces.
- `cd deployment && npm exec qm -- check`: validate deployment configuration.
- `cd deployment && npm exec qm -- check --live`: unsupported for Docker in 0.1.12.
An exit code or filename alone is not proof of a successful agent workflow.

## How the deployment fits together

- **One Linux box runs everything in Docker.** That covers the QM containers
  (core, portal and web UI, from the pinned `qm` CLI), GBrain with its
  PostgreSQL, the Caddy TLS front door, and the **agent computer**
  (`qm-sbx-…`), which is where the agent's commands, the target app and a
  headless Chromium all run.
- **Access:** Tailscale Serve proxies `https://charlies-pc.tail1d1ed7.ts.net`
  to the portal (port 8081) for devices on the tailnet. Sign in by running
  `qm admin-login` on the Linux box and opening the link on the device
  ([setup.md](docs/setup.md#sign-in-from-your-mac)).
- **Deploying a change** means running `npm start`, which is idempotent and
  runs `qm up --build-from runtime`:
  - core patches in `deployment/runtime/patches/` are rebuilt into core;
  - skills in `deployment/sandbox/skills/` are uploaded and applied within
    30 s.
  - Sandbox image changes are different: rerun `npm run bootstrap`, then
    follow [sandbox image changes](docs/architecture.md#sandbox-image-changes).
  - During development the `motion` CLI is copied into `/root/workspace`
    ([spec §3](docs/spec.md#3-development-loop-for-the-motion-cli)).
- **The browser is headless and private to the agent computer.** Nobody can
  see or click it, and the computer publishes no ports, so its
  `localhost:4173` is unreachable from the host. Users see evidence as images
  the agent attaches to its reply.

## Repository map

- `deployment/`: CLI-managed QM config, support Compose services, runtime skills.
- `scripts/`: repeatable operator setup, access, and smoke checks.
- `src/motion/`: the `motion` CLI (capture, inspect, compare with user videos).
- `docs/`: short product, setup, implementation, and demo documentation.
- `.agents/skills/`: developer skills discovered by Codex/Astra.
- `.claude/skills/`: relative links for Claude Code/Fable discovery.
- `CLAUDE.md`: relative symlink to this authoritative file.
- `.upstream/`: ignored pinned checkouts; never mistake these for our code.
- `.state/`: ignored local credentials, TLS keys, tooling, and session state.
- `artifacts/`: ignored smoke evidence, build logs, and raw recordings.

## Ownership and secrets

The npm QM package owns the runtime and deployment CLI. The pinned QM checkout
is reference material. Track any necessary source patch explicitly, with its
base commit, and rebuild the actual service; a layer build is not deployment.
The local sandbox image must include QM's execution daemon and browser tools.
GBrain is a separate service. Agent computers get only a scoped thin client;
never give them its database credentials or administrative OAuth grants.
Use local Chromium for localhost applications; no paid remote browser fallback.
Never commit secrets, login links, browser profiles, cookies, database files,
runtime volumes, node_modules, raw videos, or private session transcripts.
The one exception is the curated demo record in `docs/demo-run/`: a transcript
exported by `scripts/export-transcript.mjs` (redacted: no reasoning, IDs,
addresses or tokens; scanned before commit) and the agent's small rendered
before/after clips.
Use ignored mode-600 files and supported provider/admin forms for credentials.
Never copy developer subscription tokens into QM as invented API credentials.
Preserve unrelated work and services. Stop retains data; destructive reset
requires an explicit user request and a precisely identified target.

## Evidence and implementation

Distinguish implemented, proposed, failed, and blocked behavior everywhere.
Verify real model output, real command execution, and actual image delivery.
A PNG path in a text tool result does not put an image in model vision context.
Retain browser/version, viewport, app revision, initial state, interaction steps,
actual timestamps, capture overhead caveats, and durable evidence references.
Align before/after takes to the trigger. Every take is a fresh take; never source-reset between before and after.
Pixel differences measure change; the agent judges whether intent is satisfied.
Do not claim smoothness from nominal FPS or filter click-induced movement away.
Memory failure must leave capture and inspection usable and visibly report failure.
Test meaningful boundaries and the happy path; avoid exhaustive tests and
mock-only integration claims. Repeat checks after relevant changes or failures.
Keep changes small and inspect the staged diff before committing or pushing.
Update PROGRESS.md at useful checkpoints so another agent can resume directly.
Do ordinary authorized work without repeatedly asking for confirmation.
Delegate independent bounded tasks only when supported and useful; assign
non-overlapping edits and verify the combined result before calling it done.
Architecture-review skills are optional aids, never mandatory kickoff ceremony.
