# PROJECT KNOWLEDGE BASE

## OVERVIEW

`kiro-lb` is a Rust gateway (axum + tokio) that exposes Kiro (Amazon Q
Developer / CodeWhisperer) through OpenAI- and Anthropic-compatible APIs, load
balances across a pool of Kiro accounts, and ships a React operations dashboard
embedded in the binary. **AGPL-3.0**: a Rust rewrite of the Python port of
`jwadow/kiro-gateway`; see `LICENSE` and `NOTICE.md` (do not relicense).

The Python implementation was removed. Its SQLite schema, `/v1` wire format,
`/api/dashboard` JSON, session cookie and scrypt key format are kept
byte-compatible, so an existing `data/dashboard.sqlite3` opens with no migration.

## CONVENTIONS

- Reasoning is forwarded only from native upstream frames. Never synthesize it
  from response text or prompt tags.
- OpenAI reasoning is emitted as `reasoning`, not `reasoning_content`; requests
  accept both.
- Any new client-visible behavior lands on OpenAI **and** Anthropic, streaming
  and non-streaming.
- `/v1/responses` is a translation facade over chat completions, not a third
  pipeline: failover, payload building and token accounting are inherited.
- The Codex CLI declares tools in an `additional_tools` input item, and its
  shell is a `custom` freeform tool. It is bridged as a function with one string
  field and unwrapped back into `custom_tool_call`. Dropping it made the model
  invent command output.
- Each protocol's usage object carries only the fields that protocol defines.
- Token counting: `cl100k_base` for Claude and unknown names, `o200k_base` for
  GPT/o-series and deepseek/qwen/minimax/glm. The CJK correction is a property of
  the script and is 1.0 for Latin text.
- Per-key token rows are keyed by the normalized model name.
- Output speed follows the benchmark definition (Artificial Analysis, IETF
  TPOT): `(output_tokens - 1) / (t_last - t_first)` between the first and last
  output event. Time to first token is stored separately (`request_logs.ttft_ms`)
  and never mixed into speed. `generation_ms` is that decode window, and
  `timed_completion_tokens` adds `completion - 1` so the `/metrics` ratio
  matches. Non-streaming responses have no per-token timing and record no speed.
- Control and data planes stay separate: dashboard sessions cannot call `/v1`,
  `/v1` keys cannot call `/api/dashboard`. `/metrics` takes a `/v1` bearer key.
- The SQLite store never holds prompts, completions or raw client keys. New
  columns arrive by additive `PRAGMA table_info` + `ALTER TABLE`.
- Request bodies have no axum size limit (`DefaultBodyLimit::disable`); the
  payload guard is the only size check.
- `web_search` auto-injection (Path B) is opt-in; native server-side
  `web_search` (Path A) always works.
- `load_balancing` defaults to `session`: one conversation stays on one account
  so Kiro's per-account prompt cache stays warm (~1.6s vs 2.4-6s to first byte).
  It falls back to weighted order when that account is unavailable.
- Frontend logic a panel derives lives in a plain module beside the component
  (eslint `react-refresh/only-export-components`). UI strings go through
  `usePreferences().t` with catalogs in `frontend/src/features/dashboard/i18n/`;
  en-US text must stay identical to what tests assert.
- Code, comments and identifiers are English only.

## ANTI-PATTERNS (THIS PROJECT)

- Editing `static/**` by hand: it is `frontend/` build output.
- Putting images into `userInputMessageContext`; they go in
  `userInputMessage.images`.
- Emitting `toolResults` without the preceding assistant `toolUses`.
- Normalizing roles after `ensure_alternating_roles()`.
- Client-specific stream mutilation in the gateway.
- Inventing a usage field (`context_usage_percentage` was reverted).
- Applying the Claude correction coefficient to prompt tokens or to Latin text.
- Measuring the payload guard as UTF-8 bytes. `CONTENT_LENGTH_EXCEEDS_THRESHOLD`
  tracks cl100k tokens of the compact JSON (claude-opus-5: 800k Hangul pass /
  1M fail, 2026-08-23). Image base64 is not part of it: the guard blanks
  `images[].source.bytes` and adds ceil(w*h/750) per image (capped at 1600),
  because upstream only enforces its own 5 MiB per-image cap (2026-09-27).
  Thinking `signature` strings are blanked the same way: they are opaque
  attestations, and one session's signatures measured 794k tokens while
  contextUsage reported ~19% (#93).
- Hoisting a mid-conversation `system`/`developer` message into the system
  prompt. The system prompt is prepended to the first history turn, so a
  message that changes every turn (Claude Code's `<total_tokens>`) changed the
  prompt prefix and defeated Kiro's per-account prompt cache. Only leading
  system messages become the system prompt; later ones stay in place as
  `<system-reminder>` user text.
- Closing idle upstream connections early. Each new TLS connection to Kiro
  costs ~340ms and a reader idles longer than 90s between prompts; the pool
  keeps connections 30 min with an HTTP/2 PING every 20s.
- Trusting the advertised context window. `claude-opus-4.7`, `-4.8`, `-5`,
  `-5.5` and `claude-sonnet-5` report 1000000 but charge against 666667.
- Rejecting unknown model names, or suggesting a model from another family.
- Labelling a Prometheus series with a raw model name.
- Sharing one machine id across accounts, or mixing CLI markers into the IDE
  user agent. Headers mirror a captured Kiro IDE (`src/utils.rs`), and each
  account's machine id derives from its login lineage (`KiroAuth::machine_id`).
- Sending Builder ID generation to `q.{region}.amazonaws.com`. Keep the
  request-scoped fallback profile out of persisted credentials.
- Weighting selection by absolute remaining quota, or letting a weight exclude
  an account. Every account keeps a nonzero chance.
- Persisting `quota_headroom`, `quota_resets_at` or `quota_overage_enabled` with
  runtime state; they are re-seeded from usage rows.
- Ending a 402 quarantine on a fixed timer; it runs to the reported reset.
- Removing the last-resort pass in account selection.
- Escalating a burst into a long exclusion: `USER_REQUEST_RATE_EXCEEDED` parks
  an account for 10s; only `MONTHLY_REQUEST_COUNT` quarantines it (6h).
- Assuming cache metadata exists.

## COMMANDS

```bash
cargo run --release -- --port 8000             # run gateway
cargo test                                     # unit + golden corpus
cargo fmt --check && cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
cd frontend && bun run lint && bun run typecheck && bun run test && bun run build
kirolb replay debug_logs/<capture>             # replay a failure capture
docker compose -p kiro-lb -f docker-compose.homelab.yml up -d --build
```

CI (`.github/workflows/build.yml`):

1. `frontend`: eslint, tsc, vitest, then build `static/`.
2. `test`: fmt, clippy and `cargo test`.
3. `binaries`: builds the release executables:
   - `kirolb-windows-x64.exe` and `kirolb-windows-arm64.exe` (static CRT);
   - `kirolb-linux-x64` and `kirolb-linux-arm64` (musl, statically linked, so they run on any distro).
4. `release`: runs on `v*` tags and attaches the binaries plus `SHA256SUMS` to a GitHub release.
5. `docker`: builds and pushes a multi-arch image from the Linux binaries.

The Docker image needs `dist/kirolb-linux-*`, so build it from CI artifacts.

## NOTES

- First run with no `.env`: `src/bootstrap.rs` writes `.env.example` (embedded
  in the binary) and a `.env` with a random `PROXY_API_KEY` and
  `DASHBOARD_PASSWORD`, then prints them. An existing `.env` is never touched.
- The gateway starts with an empty store and warns; add the first account from
  the dashboard. `/v1` answers 503 until then.
- tiktoken vocabularies are compiled into the binary; no network is needed to
  count tokens.
- `/metrics` reads only stored data, so a scrape cannot spend upstream quota.
  The homelab pushes it to Pushgateway from a workstation timer (`deploy/`).
- `deploy/grafana/kiro-lb.json` is the checked-in dashboard; edit it in the repo.
- `tools/golden/corpus` is the frozen Python oracle. The recorder was removed
  with the Python code, so the corpus can no longer be regenerated; extend Rust
  unit tests instead.
