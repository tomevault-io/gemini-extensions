# Cursor API Data Interpretation Guide

This file documents non-obvious behaviors, gotchas, and correct interpretations of data from the Cursor Enterprise APIs. Built from real-world analysis of team data and cross-referencing with Cursor docs, forum posts, and community tools.

## The Three APIs

Cursor provides three separate APIs, each with its own API key:

1. **Admin API** - Members, daily usage aggregates, spending, usage events, billing groups
2. **Analytics API** - Team-level and per-user analytics (DAU, models, agent edits, tabs, MCP, etc.)
3. **AI Code Tracking API** - Per-commit breakdown of AI vs human code (NOT currently collected by us)

We currently use Admin API + Analytics API. The AI Code Tracking API would give us per-commit granularity but we haven't integrated it yet.

## Critical: What `totalLinesAdded` Actually Measures

The Admin API's `/teams/daily-usage-data` returns `totalLinesAdded` and `totalLinesDeleted`. These are **NOT commit-based metrics**. They track all lines changed in the editor during a day, regardless of source.

This means `totalLinesAdded` includes:
- Lines written by the agent and applied to files
- Lines from tab completions
- Lines from composer suggestions
- Lines the developer typed manually
- Lines from paste operations, refactoring tools, etc.

**`acceptedLinesAdded`** is a subset - it only counts lines from explicitly accepted AI suggestions (tab accepts, composer accepts). But here's the critical gap:

### Agent Mode Does NOT Reliably Count as "Accepted Lines"

When the agent writes code directly to files (which is the default behavior in agent mode), those lines show up in `totalLinesAdded` but may NOT show up in `acceptedLinesAdded`. The agent applies changes directly to files without going through the explicit "suggest -> accept" flow that tab completions and composer use.

Evidence from our data:
- Users with 100% agent mode (0 composer, 0 tabs) show `acceptedLinesAdded` as a small fraction of `totalLinesAdded`
- Users like arielki: 77,830 lines_added, 0 accepted_lines, 171 agent_requests - impossible if agent lines counted as accepted
- The `totalApplies` and `totalAccepts` fields track the agent diff review flow (apply = agent showed a diff, accept = user accepted it), but the actual lines written by the agent to files are broader than just these diffs

**Bottom line: You CANNOT use `acceptedLinesAdded / totalLinesAdded` as "% of code written by AI" for agent-heavy users. It will massively undercount AI contribution.**

### The AI Code Tracking API Has Better Data

The separate `/analytics/ai-code/commits` endpoint (AI Code Tracking API) provides per-commit breakdown:
- `tabLinesAdded` - lines from tab completions
- `composerLinesAdded` - lines from composer/agent
- `nonAiLinesAdded` - manually written lines

These sum to `totalLinesAdded`. This is the correct way to measure AI vs human code. However:
- Only tracks code committed through Cursor's Source Control panel
- Commits made via external git tools (terminal, VS Code, etc.) are NOT tracked
- We don't currently collect this data

## What `totalApplies`, `totalAccepts`, `totalRejects` Mean

These track the **agent diff review flow**:
- `totalApplies` - Number of times the agent presented a code diff to the user
- `totalAccepts` - Number of times the user accepted the diff
- `totalRejects` - Number of times the user explicitly rejected the diff

The gap between `totalApplies` and `totalAccepts + totalRejects` represents diffs that were dismissed without explicit action (user moved on, started a new request, etc.).

Note: In YOLO/auto-apply mode, the agent writes directly to files without showing diffs. These changes may not increment `totalApplies` at all, which means some users will show low applies despite heavy agent usage.

## Request Types and Billing

### Request Fields in Daily Usage
- `agentRequests` - Number of agent mode requests (the primary interaction mode)
- `composerRequests` - Number of composer requests (older feature, being phased out)
- `chatRequests` - Number of chat/ask mode requests
- `usageBasedReqs` - Requests that consumed usage-based billing (cost real money beyond plan)
- `subscriptionIncludedReqs` - Requests covered by the subscription (we don't store this)
- `cmdkUsages` - Inline edit (Cmd+K) usages (we don't store this)
- `bugbotUsages` - Bugbot code review usages (we don't store this)

### How Billing Works
Cursor uses **token-based billing**, not fixed per-request pricing.
For current plan details and pricing, see: https://cursor.com/pricing

Key concepts that affect how we interpret the data:
- Each plan includes a monthly usage allowance per user
- Usage is calculated based on the model's public API token price plus a Cursor surcharge
- Once the included allowance is exhausted, additional usage is billed at the same rate
- `spend_cents` in the spending API = total cost including the included portion
- `included_spend_cents` = the portion covered by the plan
- Actual overage = `spend_cents - included_spend_cents`

### Model Pricing
Cursor charges at provider list prices (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, xAI) plus a Teams/Enterprise surcharge of $0.25/1M total tokens. Max mode adds +20% on top. Auto mode has fixed blended rates. There is no public API for pricing tables — the canonical source is `cursor.com/docs/models`. Per-model token prices are NOT needed in our code because `usage_events.total_cents` already has the computed cost per request.

### Model Cost Drivers
Model choice is the PRIMARY cost driver. The specific models change over time, but the cost principles are stable:

- **Standard models** - Default context window, most cost-effective
- **Thinking variants** - Generate internal reasoning tokens before responding. These count as output tokens (which cost more than input), so a thinking request can easily cost 3-5x more
- **Max mode variants** - Much larger context window (e.g. 1M vs 200k). More input tokens per request means higher cost
- **Max + thinking** - Most expensive combination

For current model list and capabilities, see: https://cursor.com/docs/models

### The `fast_premium_requests` Field
Legacy field from the old fixed-pricing model. It's NOT the current billing mechanism but is still returned by the API. Don't rely on it for cost analysis.

## What We Can and Cannot Reliably Measure

### Reliable (use with confidence)
- `agentRequests`, `composerRequests`, `chatRequests` - accurate request counts per mode
- `spend_cents` and `included_spend_cents` - accurate billing data
- `totalTabsShown` and `tabsAccepted` - accurate tab completion metrics
- `mostUsedModel` - accurate per-day model preference
- `isActive` - whether the user was active that day
- `clientVersion` - what Cursor version they're on

### Unreliable or Misleading (use with caveats)
- `totalLinesAdded` - includes ALL editor changes, not just AI or committed code
- `acceptedLinesAdded` - undercounts AI contribution for agent-mode users
- `acceptedLinesAdded / totalLinesAdded` as "AI %" - WRONG for agent users, only valid for tab/composer-heavy users
- `totalApplies` - may undercount in YOLO/auto-apply mode
- `usageBasedReqs` vs `agentRequests` - the gap between these is unclear; likely `usageBasedReqs` counts only requests that consumed usage-based billing
- `nonAiLinesAdded` from ai-code/commits - NOT "manually typed code". It's "unattributed lines" — lines where Cursor's server couldn't trace back to an AI generation event. Breaks on squash merges (attribution from individual commits is lost), initial commits to new repos (no prior AI tracking context), and code that went through review cycles. Verified against real data: a 100% agent-driven user showed 43% "nonAI" due to squash merges and initial commits. Do NOT use this as "% manual work".

### AI Code Tracking API (`/analytics/ai-code/commits`) Limitations

Investigated Feb 2026 by comparing real user data against git history and studying git-ai's approach:

1. **Squash merges lose attribution**: When a PR is squash-merged, the final commit has no record of the individual AI edits from development. All lines appear as `nonAiLinesAdded`. This is the #1 source of false "manual" attribution for teams using squash merge workflows.

2. **Initial commits to new repos**: The first commit to a new repo has no prior AI tracking context. Even if the agent wrote 100% of the code, it all shows as `nonAiLinesAdded`.

3. **Only Cursor Source Control panel commits are tracked**: Terminal `git commit`, VS Code source control, and external git tools produce no tracking data at all.

4. **git-ai (open source alternative) solves this differently**: Uses real-time IDE checkpoints (pre/post edit hooks) stored in `.git/ai/`, intersected with the actual diff at commit time. Survives rebases, squash merges, cherry-picks by rewriting authorship logs. Requires installing their tool — not replicable from API data.

5. **Industry consensus (DX Framework, Cursor's own research)**: Lines-of-code metrics are unreliable for measuring adoption. The recommended approach combines accept rate + engagement intensity + consistency. See "AI Adoption Score" in Derived Metrics.

### Now Collected
- Per-request token/cost data from `/teams/filtered-usage-events` - gives per-model cost breakdown per user. Stored in `usage_events` table. Collected incrementally (since last timestamp).
- Command adoption from `/analytics/team/commands` - team-level command usage. Stored in `analytics_commands` table.
- Plan mode adoption from `/analytics/team/plans` - plan mode usage by model. Stored in `analytics_plans` table.
- Per-user MCP tool usage from `/analytics/by-user/mcp` - which MCP tools each user uses. Stored in `analytics_user_mcp` table.
- Per-user command usage from `/analytics/by-user/commands` - which commands each user uses. Stored in `analytics_user_commands` table.
- AI Code Tracking from `/analytics/ai-code/commits` - per-commit AI vs manual line attribution. Stored in `ai_code_commits` table (aggregated per user per day per repo). Primary key is `(email, date, repo_name)`. Provides `tabLinesAdded`, `composerLinesAdded`, `nonAiLinesAdded` per commit. Used for repository code volume on insights page and per-user repo breakdown. Note: tab/composer/nonAI breakdown is unreliable (see limitations above) — only total lines and AI % are shown in the UI. Only tracks commits made through Cursor's Source Control panel — terminal git commits are not captured.

### Not Currently Collected (but available)
- Per-user breakdowns from `/analytics/by-user/*` endpoints for: agent-edits, tabs, models, plans, ask-mode, client-versions, top-file-extensions (we collect mcp and commands per-user, but not these others)
- Leaderboard from `/analytics/team/leaderboard` - ranks users by tab accepts and agent edits. We chose NOT to collect this because it introduces a third ranking system that conflicts with our own spend_rank and activity_rank, confusing stakeholders.
- `cmdkUsages`, `subscriptionIncludedReqs`, `apiKeyReqs`, `bugbotUsages` - available in daily usage but not stored
- Audit logs from `/teams/audit-logs` - login events, settings changes, security events

## Derived Metrics We Use

### $/req (Cost Per Request)
`spend_cents / agent_requests / 100`

Useful but context-dependent. High $/req can mean:
- Expensive model choice (opus-max vs opus-high) - most common cause
- Long context sessions (large codebases)
- Thinking mode usage (more output tokens)
- NOT necessarily inefficiency

### Accept Rate
`total_accepts / total_applies * 100`

What it tells you: How often the user accepts agent-suggested diffs.
What it does NOT tell you: Quality of work, developer skill, or AI effectiveness.
Low accept rate could mean: picky reviewer (good), bad prompting (fixable), or wrong tool for the task (neutral).

### Lines Per Request
`lines_added / agent_requests`

Highly task-dependent. A debugging session produces 0 lines. A scaffolding task produces 500. Not a quality metric.

### AI Adoption Score (0-100%)
Composite score from three signals in `daily_usage`, weighted:
- **Accept Rate** (40%) — `total_accepts / total_applies` — trust in AI output
- **Engagement Intensity** (40%) — `agent_requests / active_days`, normalized against team p90 — how heavily they lean on AI
- **Consistency** (20%) — `active_days / period_days` — regular usage vs sporadic

Tiers: AI-Native (80%+), High (55%+), Moderate (30%+), Low (10%+), Manual (<10%).

Why this works better than commit-based AI%:
- Available for ALL users (not just the ~18% who commit through Cursor's Source Control)
- Not affected by squash merges, initial commits, or external git tools
- Validated by Cursor's own productivity research (accept rate correlates with developer proficiency) and the DX AI Measurement Framework (combine frequency + acceptance + consistency)
- Actually differentiating: accept rate ranges 0-100% across real team data, engagement intensity ranges 2-130 reqs/day

The commit-based AI% from `ai_code_commits` is shown as a secondary "AI Code %" metric with a caveat about attribution limitations.

## Daily Spend Data Sources

`usage_events` (from `/teams/filtered-usage-events`) is the most reliable source for daily spend data. It has per-request cost (`total_cents`) with full billing cycle history and no retention window. `daily_spend` (from `/teams/groups` billing groups API) has only ~2 days retention and systematically underreports compared to `usage_events`.

The dashboard daily spend chart uses `usage_events` as the primary source, falling back to `daily_spend` only when the `usage_events` table is empty (e.g., a fresh install that hasn't collected events yet). The chart marks the last 2 days as "provisional" since spend data for today/yesterday may still be accumulating.

## Conversation Insights (Dashboard-Only)

The Cursor web dashboard has a "Conversation Insights" page (`cursor.com/dashboard?tab=conversation-insights`) that shows Work Type (KTLO/Feature/Bug), Intent Distribution (Write Code/Ask/Task Automation/Plan), Categories (Bug Fix/Configuration/Feature/Refactor), Task Complexity, and Prompt Specificity. This data is computed server-side from conversation content using AI analysis. There is NO API endpoint for it — it is a dashboard-only enterprise feature.

- `/analytics/by-user/top-file-extensions` — per-user file types (not collected)

## Critical: Billing Groups API Daily Spend Retention

The `/teams/groups` endpoint returns `dailySpend` per member, but this data has a **very short retention window — approximately 2 days**. Older daily spend data is dropped from the API response entirely.

This means:
- If you don't collect at least once per day, you will permanently lose daily spend granularity for missed days
- Early-day collections capture incomplete data (spend accumulates throughout the day)
- The `upsertDailySpend` function uses `MAX(existing, new)` to prevent regressions from partial data overwriting complete data
- Ideal collection frequency: at least twice daily (e.g. midday + end of day) to capture most of each day's spend before it falls off the API
- The dashboard marks the last 2 days as "partial (API lag)" since spend data may not be fully settled yet
