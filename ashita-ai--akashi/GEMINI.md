# ashita-ai/akashi

Decision coordination layer for multi-agent AI systems ("version control for AI decisions").

## Tech stack

- **Server:** Go 1.26, stdlib `net/http` (Go 1.22+ routing), no framework
- **Database:** PostgreSQL 18 + pgvector + TimescaleDB, Atlas for migrations
- **Auth:** Ed25519 JWT + Argon2id API keys, RBAC (platform_admin > org_owner > admin > agent > reader)
- **UI:** React 19, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS (embedded via `go:embed` with `ui` build tag)
- **SDKs:** Go, Python, TypeScript (in `sdk/`)
- **Testing:** `testing` + testify assertions, testcontainers-go for integration tests
- **Lint:** golangci-lint v2.11.0, Atlas migrate validate

## First-time setup

```sh
make install-hooks   # installs Claude Code hooks (akashi-trace reminder after git commit)
```

This registers a `PostToolUse` hook that fires after every `git commit` and reminds you to call `akashi_trace`. Run once per machine; safe to re-run.

## Commands

**Before every commit (mandatory, CI rejects failures):**
```sh
make preflight
```

This is `ci.yml`'s build job minus the tests: tidy + go.mod diff, doc/config consistency,
Atlas migration validation, `go build`, the **lite build** (`-tags lite ./cmd/akashi-local`),
lint, and vet. No Docker, no database, no API keys. The Makefile target is the only definition —
do not restate the command list here, which is how the two CI-enforced gates went missing from
it for months. The raw commands are kept as a comment above the target.

**Before every push (mandatory, CI runs with `-race`):**
```sh
go test -race -count=1 ./...                       # unit tests only (fast, no containers)
go test -race -count=1 -tags integration ./...     # full suite (unit + integration, requires Docker)
```

**Build:**
```sh
go build ./...                           # without UI
cd ui && npm ci && npm run build && cd .. # build UI assets first
go build -tags ui ./...                  # with embedded React SPA
make ci                                  # full local CI mirror
```

**If go mod tidy changes go.mod/go.sum**, stage them in the commit.
**If atlas validate fails**, run `atlas migrate hash --dir file://migrations` and stage `migrations/atlas.sum`.
**golangci-lint location:** `~/go/bin/golangci-lint` (install: `go install github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/v2/cmd/golangci-lint@v2.11.0`).

## Project structure

```
cmd/akashi/          Server entrypoint. Config loading, dependency wiring, signal handling.
cmd/akashi-local/    Local-lite MCP server (SQLite, stdio transport, zero-infra). See ADR-009.
cmd/eval-conflicts/  Evaluation harness for conflict detection precision/recall. Only
                     --mode=benchmark runs standalone; --mode=validator and --mode=scorer
                     need a running server, and --mode=gold needs AKASHI_DB_DSN plus a
                     populated conflict_gold_labels table. See docs/conflict-detection.md.
internal/
  server/            HTTP handlers (handlers*.go), middleware (middleware.go), SSE broker.
  storage/           PostgreSQL queries. One file per entity (decisions.go, agents.go, events.go...).
  storage/sqlite/    SQLite storage backend for local/lite mode. Carries NO build tag — it
                     compiles in every build and is simply not imported outside cmd/akashi-local.

```

## Architecture patterns

**Multi-tenancy via org_id.** Every query MUST include `AND org_id = $N`. There are 400+ org_id references across the storage layer. Missing one is a data leak. When adding a new query, always scope by org_id.

**Bi-temporal model.** Decisions have `valid_from`/`valid_to` (business time) and `transaction_time` (system time). Active records have `valid_to IS NULL`. Always include this filter in queries that should return current state.

**Event-sourced ingestion.** `POST /v1/trace` creates a decision through events (`DecisionMade`, `DecisionRevised`). Events flow: HTTP handler -> idempotency check -> event buffer (WAL optional) -> COPY flush to Postgres -> embedding -> conflict scoring.

**Handler pattern.** All handlers are methods on the `Handlers` struct. Routes are registered in `server.go` using Go 1.22+ `METHOD /path` syntax with middleware wrappers (`adminOnly`, `writeRole`, `readRole`).

**RBAC enforcement.** The auth middleware extracts claims. Role-based middleware (`adminOnly`, `writeRole`, `readRole`) gates route access. Within handlers, `filterDecisionsByAccess` in `server/authz.go` post-filters query results for fine-grained grant checking.

## How to add a new API endpoint

1. Add the handler method to the appropriate `handlers_*.go` file:
```go
func (h *Handlers) HandleMyThing(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    orgID := OrgIDFromContext(r.Context())   // always extract org
    claims := ClaimsFromContext(r.Context()) // caller identity: claims.ActorID(), claims.Role
    // ... business logic ...
    writeJSON(w, r, http.StatusOK, result)
}
```
There is no `AgentIDFromContext`. The caller's identity comes off `ClaimsFromContext`, whose
`ActorID()` prefers `AgentID` (API-key auth) and falls back to `Subject` (JWT auth).

2. Register the route in `server.go`:
```go
mux.Handle("GET /v1/my-thing", readRole(http.HandlerFunc(h.HandleMyThing)))
```
`adminOnly`, `orgOwnerOnly`, `writeRole` and `readRole` are local variables declared inside
`New()` (server.go:158, :172, :185, :192), not package-level functions — they exist only in that
scope. Pick the lowest role that is still correct: `readRole` (reader+) for queries, `writeRole`
(agent+) for ingestion, `adminOnly` for management, `orgOwnerOnly` for anything irreversible.
`POST /v1/decisions/{id}/erase` at server.go:173 is the worked example of the last case. The full
five-level ladder is in `docs/faq.md`; changing an existing endpoint's role is an ask-first item.

3. Add the storage query in the appropriate `internal/storage/*.go` file. Always filter by
   `org_id`, and add `valid_to IS NULL` if the query should return current state.

4. Add a cross-org test. `TestHandlersCritical_GetDecisionCrossOrgReturns404` is the template:
   a caller from org B must get 404, not 403, for a resource in org A.

5. Add the endpoint to `api/openapi.yaml`. This one is machine-checked —
   `internal/server/openapi_test.go` parses the route registrations out of server.go and fails
   on any route missing from the spec.

6. Run `make preflight`.

SDK parity is **not** required for a new endpoint. All three SDKs cover well under the spec's 86
operations and always have; adding a method is welcome, and opening a follow-up issue is the norm.

## How to add a migration

1. Create `migrations/NNN_description.sql` where NNN is the next sequential number.
2. Start with a comment: `-- NNN: Brief description of what this migration does.`
3. Rehash: `atlas migrate hash --dir file://migrations`
4. Validate: `atlas migrate validate --dir file://migrations`
5. Stage both the `.sql` file and `migrations/atlas.sum`.

## Changing existing behavior

Before modifying any function's semantics (boundary conditions, error returns, nil behavior), **read the tests for that function first**. Tests often document intentional design choices via names and assertion messages (e.g. `"confidence == 0.05 is not > 0.05, so falls to edge tier"`). If a test contradicts your planned change, the test is probably right. Understand why before overriding it.

If you still believe the behavior should change, update the tests in the same commit.

## Boundaries

**Always:**
- Scope every storage query by `org_id`
- Include `valid_to IS NULL` when querying current decision state
- Run `make preflight` + `go test -race` before pushing
- Use `require.NoError(t, err)` / `assert.*` from testify in tests
- Use `writeJSON(w, r, statusCode, payload)` for HTTP responses
- Use `slog` structured logging (never `fmt.Print` or `log.*`)

**Never:**
- Commit `.env` files, API keys, or credentials
- Add `Co-Authored-By` trailers to commits
- Skip `make preflight` ("just this once" has caused two CI failures)
- Modify already-applied migrations (create a new one instead)
- Use `os.Exit` inside `run()` (it skips defers; return an error instead)
- Remove a failing test without understanding why it fails first

**Ask first:**
- Changing RBAC role requirements on an endpoint
- Adding new direct dependencies to go.mod
- Modifying the MCP server tool definitions
- Schema changes that widen access (e.g., removing org_id filters)

## Pull requests

Every PR description MUST end with a blockquote about one of these fictional universes: **Marvel**, **DC**, **Harry Potter**, **Star Wars**, **Star Trek**, or **Tolkien** (Middle-earth: LOTR / The Hobbit / Silmarillion). Choose one of these two formats:

**Option A — Argument (2-4 sentences).** Pick a universe, defend it over one of the others.

```
> Star Trek edges out Star Wars because its vision of the future is earned —
> humanity solved poverty, disease, and war before reaching the stars. Star Wars
> just handed its heroes magic swords and hoped for the best.
```

**Option B — Haiku (5-7-5).** Write an original haiku about any one of the universes.

```
> Lightsaber hums low
> A father's hand, reaching out
> Stars hold their breath still
```

The more creative and non-obvious the connection, the better. Avoid the easy metaphors — don't reach for the Borg every time you touch audit trails, or the Prime Directive every time there's a policy constraint. Surprise us.

This is not optional. PRs missing the blockquote will be sent back.

## Conventions

- Commit messages: imperative mood, concise first line, body explains "why"
- Branch names: `feature/*`, `fix/*` for PRs against `main`
- Binary output: `bin/` (gitignored)
- Specs that drive implementation live in the sibling `internal/` repo, not here
- Migration comments start with the migration number and a brief description
- Config env vars: `AKASHI_*` prefix (see `docs/configuration.md` for full reference)
- Test files use testcontainers for integration tests (`testutil.MustStartTimescaleDB()`)
