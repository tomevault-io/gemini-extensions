# Global Claude Behavior Rules

## Verify-After-Complete (MANDATORY)

After finishing any implementation, task, or plan — ALWAYS run a verification step before declaring it done. This is non-negotiable.

### What to verify depends on what was built:

| Work Type | Verification Steps |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Code / feature | Run tests, run type check, run build |
| API / server route | curl or fetch the live endpoint, check the response is real data |
| Deployment | Hit the production URL, confirm it's not the fallback/empty state |
| Config change | Confirm the config was actually picked up (e.g. env vars, settings) |
| Dependency change | Confirm the install succeeded and nothing broke |
| Git operation | `git status` to confirm clean state; `git log` to confirm commit is correct |
| File edit | Re-read the file after editing to confirm the change landed correctly |
| Fact/data update | Search for the NEW value (confirm present) AND search for the OLD value (confirm absent everywhere). Stale copies in other locations are the #1 missed verification. |

### Verification mindset
- **Don't assume it worked** — run the check. A passing build does not mean correct behavior.
- **Check the actual output**, not just exit codes. A 200 response returning `{ weeks: [], totalContributions: 0 }` is not the same as a successful response with real data.
- **When something looks suspiciously perfect** (zero errors, empty state "as expected") — investigate whether it's working correctly or silently failing gracefully.
- **End-to-end over unit** — the most important check is always the final output the user would see, not intermediate steps.
- **Bidirectional fact checks** — when updating a value (test count, version, date), grep for the OLD value across the entire scope. A fact that appears in 2 places but is only updated in 1 is a silent inconsistency.

### After verification
- If something is wrong → fix it immediately, then re-verify.
- If everything passes → explicitly state what was verified and the results.
- Never say "done" without having verified the result.
- **Return to plan after interruptions** — after completing any side-task, user interruption, or context switch, check your todo list and resume the in-progress plan item. Plans get abandoned not because they're lost, but because attention drifts. This one habit prevents the most common execution gap.
- **Finish the current task before expanding scope** — when implementing a fix, adjacent issues will surface (stale comments, inconsistent patterns, missing tests). Note them for later but do not detour into them mid-task. Scope creep is how simple tasks become 15-file changes.
- **Intentional reads over exhaustive reads** — before reading a file, decide: exploring (full read) or verifying (targeted read with offset/limit). First-time reads should be full to build understanding. Re-reads for verification should be targeted. Delegate heavy multi-file exploration to subagents to keep the main context lean.

## Diagnose-First Rule (Before Any Fix)

Before investigating any error or writing any fix plan, always run these four checks first:

### 1. Check git state
```bash
git status        # are files missing due to unstaged deletions?
git log --oneline -5  # was this already fixed in a recent commit?
```
A "missing file" finding is meaningless without first confirming it isn't just an unstaged deletion. A fix plan is pointless if the fix already exists in git history.

### 2. Identify the error source
Determine WHERE the error is coming from before investigating the code:
- **VSCode Problems panel** (source label: "Prisma", "ESLint", "TypeScript") → editor extension diagnostic, may be a false positive
- **Terminal / CLI** (`prisma generate`, `pnpm build`, etc.) → real tooling error
- **Runtime / server logs** → real application error

Never treat a VSCode editor diagnostic as a CLI or runtime error without confirming. Extension language servers can report v7-style errors on v6 code, missing file errors on symlinked paths, etc.

### 3. Check for existing suppression settings
Before planning a fix, check:
- `.vscode/settings.json` — does a suppression/pin setting already exist?
- Recent commits (`git log --grep=keyword`) — was this already addressed?

### 4. Apply minimum viable diagnosis
Ask: what is the simplest explanation that fits all the evidence?
- File not found → check `git status` before concluding the file is missing from the repo
- Build/lint error → confirm the error reproduces in CLI before assuming code needs to change
- Version-related error → confirm the installed version (`prisma --version`, `node -v`) before assuming an upgrade is needed

Only proceed with investigation and planning AFTER these checks pass. Building an elaborate plan on an unverified premise is the most common source of wasted effort.

## Plan-First Rule (MANDATORY)

ALWAYS enter plan mode (EnterPlanMode) before making any non-trivial changes. This applies even if the user doesn't explicitly ask for a plan.

**Non-trivial** = any change that modifies more than 1 file, adds new functionality, changes behavior, or touches configuration.

**Trivial** (skip plan mode) = single-line typo fix, adding a console.log, renaming a variable in one file.

If the user gives an instruction that requires non-trivial changes without requesting plan mode:
1. Enter plan mode proactively
2. Design the approach
3. Present for user approval
4. Only then execute

The user prefers human review before execution. Plan -> Review -> Execute.

## Verify-Before-Exit-Plan (Before Exiting Plan Mode)

Before calling ExitPlanMode, run these mechanical checks on your own plan. Do NOT skip these — tunnel vision during planning causes the most wasted review cycles.

### 1. Count check
If the plan says "N files modified" or "N steps", count them. Do the numbers match?

### 2. Path check
For every file path in the plan, verify it exists (Read/Glob) or is explicitly marked as "new file". For paths that reference current content (e.g., "lines 100-120"), read the file and confirm those lines contain what you think.

**Stale value absence**: When the plan updates a fact (count, version, date), grep the entire target file for the OLD value — not just the specific line. A fact updated on one line but left stale on another line of the same file is the #1 missed verification.

### 3. Wiring check + consumer role-play
For every NEW file or feature, ask: "who consumes this?" If a new file is created but no existing code loads/reads/imports it, there's a missing wiring step. Then **read each consumer's actual code** and role-play as it: "I'm [consumer]. Do I have everything I need to use this new thing?"

### 4. Policy check
If the plan references or contradicts any rule in MEMORY.md, CLAUDE.md, or preferences — grep the source file and verify the actual text. Don't rely on memory of what the rule says.

### 5. Example content check
If the plan includes example content, templates, or sample data — verify it's from the correct project/context, not copy-pasted from a different source.

### 6. Completeness check
For each item in the plan, trace its full lifecycle: creation → wiring → testing → documentation. If any step is missing, add it. Then re-run check #1 (counts may have changed).

These checks take 2-3 minutes. Skipping them costs 30+ minutes in external review cycles.

### 7. Fresh-context review
After checks 1-6 pass, spawn a `code-reviewer` Task subagent with this prompt structure:

> **Plan text**: [paste the full plan]
> **Original requirement**: [paste the user's original request]
> **Your task**: Run the 7-point verification checklist from `.claude/agents/verify-plan.md`. Report findings as a table: Check | Status | Finding. Be mechanical — report facts, not opinions.

The subagent sees the plan cold (different context window = different attention patterns). This catches design blind spots that self-review in the same context cannot. Run this on every plan for consistent output quality.

## Stack Rules (customize for your project)

<!-- IMPORTANT: CLAUDE.md is committed to git and visible to everyone on the team.
     Do NOT put secrets (API keys, passwords, tokens, connection strings) here.
     Use environment variables or a secrets manager for credentials. -->

<!-- Add your project's framework-specific rules below. These complement the behavioral rules above
     with concrete conventions for your tech stack. Replace the examples with your own. -->

<!-- Example rules (delete these and add your own):

- Use [your framework]'s recommended project structure — don't invent custom layouts
- Use a singleton ORM/database client — never instantiate a new connection per request in serverless environments
- Soft delete only — never hard DELETE records. Set `is_active = false` and `deleted_at = now()`
- All API responses follow the project's envelope format: `{ data, error, meta }`

See PRESETS.md > "Stack Rule Templates" for more examples organized by project type. -->

## Compact Instructions

When auto-compacting or manually compacting this conversation, preserve:
- Current todo list with status of each item
- All file paths that were modified in this session
- Pending verification steps not yet completed
- Key decisions made and their rationale
- Active plan context (what we're building and why)
- Any user preferences or constraints stated in this session
