## asc skills

Agent Skills for automating `asc` workflows including builds, TestFlight, metadata sync, submissions, and signing. https://github.com/rorkai/app-store-connect-cli-skills

## Core Principles

- **Explicit flags**: Use long-form flags in docs/tests/examples (`--app`, `--output`) for clarity
- **TTY-aware output defaults**: `table` in interactive terminals, `json` for pipes/CI; use `--output` for explicit formats
- **No interactive prompts**: Use `--confirm` flags for destructive operations
- **Pagination**: `--paginate` fetches all pages automatically

## Discovering Commands

**Before implementing or testing any command, run `--help` to confirm the exact interface.** The CLI is self-documenting:

```bash
asc --help                    # List all commands
asc builds --help             # List builds subcommands
asc builds list --help        # Show all flags for a command
```

Do not memorize commands. Always check `--help` for the current interface.

## Documentation

When looking up App Store Connect API docs, prefer the `sosumi.ai` mirror instead of `developer.apple.com`.
Replace `https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi/...` with `https://sosumi.ai/documentation/appstoreconnectapi/...`.

## OpenAPI (offline)

For endpoint existence and request/response schemas, use the offline snapshot:
`docs/openapi/latest.json` and the quick index `docs/openapi/paths.txt`.
Update instructions live in `docs/openapi/README.md`.

Notes:
- Validate flags against the *request* schema for the method you're implementing (create vs update often differ).
- Validate query params against the specific endpoint (top-level vs relationship endpoints may allow different filters).

## Build & Test

```bash
make build      # Build binary
ASC_BYPASS_KEYCHAIN=1 make test  # Run tests with keychain bypass (always run before committing)
make lint       # Lint code
make format     # Format code
make install-hooks  # Install local pre-commit hook (.githooks/pre-commit)
```

Canonical test rule: all test runs must use `ASC_BYPASS_KEYCHAIN=1` to avoid host keychain prompts and profile bleed-through.

## PR Guardrails

- Before opening or merging a PR, run `make format`, `make check-command-docs`, `make lint`, and `ASC_BYPASS_KEYCHAIN=1 make test`.
- If command/help text changed, run `make generate-command-docs` and commit `docs/COMMANDS.md` before running checks.
- Use `make install-hooks` once per clone to enforce local pre-commit checks.
- CI must enforce formatting + lint + tests on both PR and `main` workflows.
- Remove unused shared wrappers/helpers when commands are refactored.

## PR Audit Workflow

- When the user says `audit the PR`, treat it as a standing workflow; do not wait for them to restate the same instructions.
- Check the PR out in an isolated git worktree (preferred) with its own local branch so the user's main checkout stays untouched.
- Audit the full PR, not just the latest commit: inspect the branch diff, review all commits on the PR, and run the relevant tests/checks.
- PR audits are fix-forward by default in this repo: if you find concrete issues, fix them, add/update tests, create a new commit, and push to the PR branch unless the user explicitly asks for review-only.
- After pushing audit fixes, inspect GitHub PR review comments/threads with `gh`, address actionable feedback, commit and push follow-up fixes, and resolve threads you fully handled.
- After the first push, keep checking for new PR comments/review threads about every minute for 5-10 minutes total, fixing and pushing follow-up changes if needed unless the user tells you to stop.
- Assume `gh` auth is already available for PR audit tasks; use `gh` directly and only stop to ask if auth actually fails.
- For all PR-audit test runs and live CLI/API verification, use `ASC_BYPASS_KEYCHAIN=1` so auth resolves from config/env instead of the macOS keychain.
- Prefer the throwaway App Store Connect app `ASC Test 20260216074703` (`6759231657`) for live mutating verification during PR audits.
- The `ASC Test` app is disposable: it is acceptable to create/cancel submissions and mutate resources there for validation, but still clean up temporary artifacts when possible.
- Avoid mutating non-throwaway apps during PR audits unless the user explicitly approves it or there is no safer way to validate the change.
- In the PR audit handoff, include the audit findings, fixes made, commits/pushes performed, commands run, test results, and any live ASC state that could not be cleaned up.

## Issue Triage & Labeling

- When creating or triaging a GitHub issue, ensure it ends the task with exactly one label
  from each of these buckets:
  - type: `bug`, `enhancement`, or `question`
  - priority: `p0`, `p1`, `p2`, or `p3`
  - difficulty: `easy`, `medium`, or `hard`
- If an issue is created without labels, add the missing labels immediately as part of the
  same task.
- Use priority for urgency and user impact, not implementation size.
- Use difficulty for implementation scope/risk, not urgency.
- Do not leave newly created issues without a type, priority, and difficulty label.
- If the exact label is ambiguous, prefer the lower priority/difficulty and note the
  assumption in the handoff.

## Testing Discipline

- Use TDD for behavior changes: bugs, refactors that alter behavior, and new features.
- Start with a failing test that captures the expected behavior and edge cases.
- For new features, begin with CLI-level tests (flags, output, errors) and add unit tests for core logic.
- Verify the test fails for the right reason before implementing; keep tests green incrementally.
- **Test realistic CLI invocation patterns**, not invented happy paths. For example, when testing argument parsing, always consider:
  - Flags before subcommands: `asc --flag subcmd` vs `asc subcmd --flag`
  - Flag values that look like subcommands: `asc --report junit completion`
  - Multiple flags with values: `asc -a val1 -b val2 subcmd`
- **Model tests on actual CLI usage**, not assumed patterns. Check `--help` output to understand real command structure before writing tests.

## Debugging & Bug Fixing

- **Reproduce first**: Before fixing, run the failing test locally to confirm the issue. Don't assume you understand the bug.
- **One change at a time**: Make one small fix, verify it works, then move to the next. Don't batch multiple changes.
- **Re-run after each fix**: Re-run the specific failing test after each fix before running the full suite.
- **One logical change per commit**: Keep commits narrowly scoped and reviewable. Avoid mixing refactor + bug fix + test rewrites in a single commit.
- **Never bypass checks**: Don't use `--no-verify`, don't push directly to `main`, don't skip tests to "get around" failures.
- **Be honest about pre-existing issues**: If a test was failing before your changes, say so. Don't claim credit for "fixing" something you didn't break.
- **Verify before claiming done**: Run the specific failing test again to confirm it's fixed, not just "all tests pass".
- **Avoid broad skip logic**: Don't skip tests with generic string matches (e.g., "Keychain Error") that can hide regressions. Match specific error codes instead.
- **Isolate test auth/env state**: Tests that touch auth must set/clear relevant env vars (`ASC_BYPASS_KEYCHAIN`, `ASC_PROFILE`, `ASC_KEY_ID`, `ASC_ISSUER_ID`, `ASC_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH`, `ASC_PRIVATE_KEY`, `ASC_PRIVATE_KEY_B64`, `ASC_STRICT_AUTH`) locally and restore exact original state.
- **Local test command**: When running repository tests manually, use `ASC_BYPASS_KEYCHAIN=1 make test` to prevent macOS keychain profile prompts from host environment bleed-through.
- **Strict skip policy**: `t.Skip` is allowed only for specific, documented, reproducible conditions (exact error code/condition). Generic skip patterns are not allowed.
- **Use proper workflow**: Branch → change → test → PR. Not: main → change → push.

## Definition of Done (Single-Pass)

- Done means checks pass, key exit-code scenarios are validated, and commands run are recorded in handoff.
- For CLI behavior changes (flags, exit codes, output/reporting), follow this sequence:
  - Add/adjust failing tests first (RED), then implement (GREEN).
  - Do not add placeholder tests; every new test must assert exit code, stderr/stdout, and/or parsed structured output.
  - For every new or changed flag, add:
    - one valid-path test
    - one invalid-value test that asserts stderr and exit code `2`
  - For argument/subcommand parsing, test edge cases: flags before subcommands, flag values that match subcommand names, mixed flag order.
  - Never silently ignore accepted flags; unsupported values must return an error.
  - For JSON/XML output tests, parse output (`json.Unmarshal`/`xml.Unmarshal`) instead of relying only on string matching.
  - For report/artifact file outputs, test both successful write and write-failure behavior.
  - Verify CLI exit behavior using a built binary (not only `go run`) for black-box checks:
    - `go build -o /tmp/asc .`
    - run `/tmp/asc ...` and assert exit code + stderr/stdout
  - For any new/changed API-facing flag (query params or request attributes), cross-check `docs/openapi/latest.json` to ensure:
    - the attribute exists in the correct request schema (create-only vs update-only is common)
    - the query parameter is permitted for that endpoint (top-level vs relationship endpoints can differ)
    - if the API doesn't support it, don't ship a flag; implement client-side behavior or document the limitation explicitly
  - If the change depends on ASC API quirks and you have credentials available locally, run a minimal live smoke test with a built binary (`/tmp/asc`).
    - Prefer read-only commands first; for write operations, use a throwaway app/resource and clean up (create-then-delete).
- Before opening/updating a PR, always run:
  - `make format`
  - `make check-command-docs`
  - `make lint`
  - `ASC_BYPASS_KEYCHAIN=1 make test`
- In the PR description or handoff, include:
  - commands run
  - key exit-code scenarios validated

## Operating Mode: Architecture-First Agent Engineering

- Default mode is architecture-first, not vibe-first.
- Before implementing any new command/flag, produce a short design note covering:
  1) command placement in existing taxonomy,
  2) OpenAPI endpoint/schema validation,
  3) UX shape (flags/output/exit codes),
  4) backward-compatibility and deprecation impact,
  5) RED -> GREEN test plan.
- If command shape is ambiguous, stop and align before coding.

## Command Lifecycle & Compatibility

- User-facing commands/flags must follow lifecycle states: `experimental`, `stable`, `deprecated`, `removed`.
- Do not delete stable commands directly; deprecate first with migration guidance.
- Deprecations must include:
  - warning text in help/output,
  - tests covering old and new behavior during transition,
  - changelog entry with upgrade path.

## Agent Explainability Contract

For each substantial change, include:
- why this approach was chosen,
- one to two alternatives considered and trade-offs,
- expected invocation examples and outputs,
- edge cases and failure modes tested.

A change is not done if the reviewer cannot explain command behavior and trade-offs from the handoff.

## Parallel Agent Policy

- Parallel agents are allowed for independent exploration or test drafting.
- Final implementation integration must be done in a single coherent pass.
- Avoid concurrent edits to the same command group.

## CLI Implementation Checklist

- Register new commands in `internal/cli/registry/registry.go`.
- Always set `UsageFunc: shared.DefaultUsageFunc` for command groups and subcommands.
- For outbound HTTP, use `shared.ContextWithTimeout` (or `shared.ContextWithUploadTimeout`) so `ASC_TIMEOUT` applies.
- Validate required flags and assert stderr error messages in tests (not just `flag.ErrHelp`).
- Add `internal/cli/cmdtest` coverage for new commands; use `httptest` for network payload tests.

## Authentication

API keys are generated at https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/access/integrations/api and stored in the system keychain (with local config fallback). Never commit keys to version control.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `ASC_KEY_ID`, `ASC_ISSUER_ID`, `ASC_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH`, `ASC_PRIVATE_KEY`, `ASC_PRIVATE_KEY_B64` | Auth fallback |
| `ASC_BYPASS_KEYCHAIN` | Ignore keychain and use config/env auth |
| `ASC_STRICT_AUTH` | Fail when credentials resolve from multiple sources (`true/false`, `1/0`, `yes/no`, `y/n`, `on/off`) |
| `ASC_APP_ID` | Default app ID |
| `ASC_VENDOR_NUMBER` | Sales/finance reports |
| `ASC_TIMEOUT` | Request timeout (e.g., `90s`, `2m`) |
| `ASC_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | Timeout in seconds (alternative) |
| `ASC_UPLOAD_TIMEOUT` | Upload timeout (e.g., `60s`, `2m`) |
| `ASC_UPLOAD_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | Upload timeout in seconds (alternative) |
| `ASC_DEBUG` | Enable debug logging (set to `api` for HTTP requests/responses) |
| `ASC_DEFAULT_OUTPUT` | Default output format: `json`, `table`, `markdown`, or `md` |

When `ASC_DEFAULT_OUTPUT` is unset, defaults are TTY-aware (`table` in terminals, `json` for non-interactive output).
Explicit `--output` flags always override `ASC_DEFAULT_OUTPUT` and TTY-aware defaults.
