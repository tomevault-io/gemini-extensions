# CodeCity

A repo rendered as a 3D city you drive through. Building = file (height = √lines, footprint ∝ bytes^0.72), district = folder, glowing windows = high-churn files (≥ p90 commits). Drive-only: arcade car with chase cam, bottom card inspects the nearest building (lines/size/commits/age/co-authors), E opens the file in-city. Three cars (coupe/racer/truck, C or the button cycles), each with its own handling and synthesized engine voice. T = git-history timelapse: auto-orbit camera + scrubber, the city grows commit by commit (playback is activity-weighted, 15s full run). P = share card: cinematic 1600×900 PNG (city + stats + contributor faces + watermark) and an 8s WebM orbit clip where the city regrows (MediaRecorder, no deps). `?shot` renders a deterministic fixed-camera still for screenshot diffing; `?nobloom` skips post-processing.

## Pipeline

```
npm install                       # once
npm run dev                       # vite on http://localhost:8137
```

Routing: `/` is a landing page that takes a GitHub URL; submitting hits `GET /analyze?url=` (middleware in `vite.config.js`) which fetches the repo into `.cache/<owner>__<repo>` (cached forever — delete to re-pull; empty dir = interrupted fetch, auto-refetched), runs the analyzer, bakes `public/cities/<repo>.json`, and the page navigates to `/<repo>`. There is NO full clone: the tree comes as a streamed tarball (codeload) and history as a parallel `--bare --filter=blob:none` clone into `<dir>/.git` (+ `core.bare false`) — commits and trees only, no file contents, since `git log --name-only --no-renames` never reads blobs. `/<name>` loads `/cities/<name>.json` and drives it; unknown names bounce back to the landing page. Local repos skip the server: `node analyze.mjs <repoPath>` bakes the same file, then open `/<name>`.

AI city plan (optional): if `GROQ_API_KEY` is set when the dev server runs, `/analyze` also asks Groq (llama-3.3-70b) to pick 4–6 landmark files + a city motto from a stats digest; baked as `city.plan`, rendered as floating golden signs + a motto at the gate. No key, any failure, or a big city (> 1500 buildings) → `plan: null`, city renders normally. The key stays server-side.

Big-repo limits (all ponytail ceilings, raise if needed): cities keep only the ~3500 biggest files (smallest pruned before layout), git history parsing caps at the 50k most recent commits, line counting is a single byte-scan (no utf8 decode), avatar API pages fetch in parallel. Repos the GitHub API reports > ~1GB skip the history download entirely (even blob-less, linux's 1.3M commits of metadata are GBs) — those cities have no glow/timelapse; clone locally + `node analyze.mjs` for a monster WITH history. The vite watcher ignores `.cache/` and `public/cities/`.

Scale guards in `/analyze` (for a public deploy): `GITHUB_TOKEN` in `.env.local` lifts the API limit 60→5000/h (unauth is per-IP, ~15 analyzes/h); in-flight dedup (concurrent hits on the same repo share one bake via an `inflight` Map); `MAX_ACTIVE=4` concurrent bakes else a 503; the analyzer runs via `node analyze.mjs --bake <dir> <name> <avatarsJson>` in a child process (execFile) so its sync git-log + walk never blocks the event loop; `MAX_CACHED=40` LRU eviction of clone dirs by mtime (baked city.json kept). Avatars are written to `<dir>/.cc-avatars.json` for the child; the analyzer's walk skips dotfiles so it never becomes a building.

The renderer never touches git or the filesystem — everything it needs is baked into the city JSON by the analyzer, including the treemap layout. Keep that boundary. Server-side pieces live only in `vite.config.js`: `/analyze` (validated owner/repo, execFile — never a shell) and `/raw?repo=&p=` (file contents for the in-city reader, whitelisted against the baked city).

## Files

- `analyze.mjs` — stdlib-only Node module: fs walk, squarified treemap, one-pass `git log` enrichment (commits + age + top-3 authors with avatar URLs per file; author identities merged across emails; timelapse data: per-building `born` + 32-bucket commit histogram `g` + `city.timeline`). Exports `analyze(repoPath, name?, emailAvatars?)` for the server; CLI bakes `public/cities/<name>.json`. No shebang — esbuild bundles it into the vite config and chokes on mid-bundle shebangs. Self-test: `node analyze.mjs --check` — must pass after any analyzer change, then rebake.
- `index.html` — markup shell only (incl. the landing modal); the renderer lives in `src/`. Head carries favicon links + Open Graph/Twitter social-card meta (`og:image` points at `/og.png` under the `https://codecity.dev` placeholder domain — change to the real domain on deploy). `#cityCred` is a minimal "built by Firas Latrach" GitHub link, shown only in `body.city`. The landing page has an `#explore` row of `data-repo` chips (one click fills the field + `requestSubmit()`s to build that public city). `#cityShare` (bottom-right, city only) holds `#starRepo` — a ★ link to `https://github.com/<city.gh>` so anyone opening a shared `/<repo>` can star the source repo — and `#copyLink` (Web Share API on mobile, clipboard + "copied" tick elsewhere). `city.gh` (`owner/repo`) is baked by the server in `bake()`; local CLI bakes omit it, so the star link is guarded on its presence.
- `public/` brand assets are generated, not hand-edited: `logo.svg`/`favicon.svg` (same file), `favicon-32.png`, `apple-touch-icon.png` (180), `logo-512.png`, and `og.png` (1200×630 social card). All produced by the scratchpad `gen.mjs` from one shared isometric-city routine and rasterized with `rsvg-convert`; re-run it to regenerate.
- `src/main.js` — entry: scene bootstrap, input, car switching, inspection card, file viewer, loop.
- `src/city.js` — city geometry from city.json (plates, buildings, beacons, labels, trees) + `setCityTime(sec)` time-scrub (instance matrices only, no rebuild).
- `src/share.js` — pure share-card composer (2D canvas over the WebGL frame).
- `public/CodeCity Trailer.mp4` — the finished promo clip (H.264 + AAC, 1080p30, ~26s), music baked in. MP4/H.264/AAC on purpose: VP9+Opus WebM won't play in macOS QuickTime/Finder or reliably on X/LinkedIn. There is deliberately NO in-app trailer generator; this single file is the trailer. Music synthesized offline (`tools/gen-trailer-music.mjs` → WAV), muxed + transcoded with ffmpeg (`libx264 -pix_fmt yuv420p -c:a aac -movflags +faststart`).
- `src/game.js` — coin-run game mode (G / left play button): 40 instanced coins on the plates, 5 hearts, hard crashes cost one (1.2s grace, `rig.hit` flag set in car.js), 0 = wrecked, all coins = win. Flat repos fall back to the root plate for coin placement.
- `src/race.js` — race mode (R / left race button): 8 checkpoint gates sampled like coins then angle-sorted into a circuit, drive through in order, 3-2-1-GO countdown (car parked until GO), timer + per-repo best in localStorage. Next gate glows green with a beacon column + a chevron over the car points at it; gates are one InstancedMesh. Game, race, and timelapse all stop each other; the #gover retry/quit buttons are claimed by whichever mode ends.
- `src/car.js` — the CARS garage (body build + handling spec + engine profile per car), arcade physics, chase cam.
- `src/faces.js` — author face sprites (drawn fallback, avatar swaps in on load).
- `src/audio.js` — synthesized engine/thump/chime, no audio files. Engine = osc pair → waveshaper growl → lowpass, pitched by a virtual gearbox (RPM climbs per gear, drops ~30% on shifts) + speed² wind-noise bed; all character comes from the per-car profile in `CARS`.
- `vite.config.js` — dev/preview server on 8137 + the `/analyze` and `/raw` endpoints.

## Rules

- Buildings and district plates are ALWAYS `InstancedMesh` — never one Mesh per building, no matter the feature.
- Layout math lives in the analyzer, not the renderer.
- Dependencies stay exactly: three, vite. No new ones for anything a few lines can do.
- New car = one entry in `CARS` (build fn + spec + engine profile). No car logic anywhere else.
- Selective glow is done with two InstancedMeshes (hot/cold materials), not per-instance emissive — per-instance emissive doesn't exist in MeshStandardMaterial.
- Thresholds (glow, hot) are relative to the analyzed repo (percentiles), never absolute constants — repos vary too much.
- Avatars: GitHub noreply emails → GitHub avatar URL, other emails → gravatar `d=404`, renderer falls back to the drawn cartoon face. All baked into city.json by the analyzer.
- Commit after every working feature.
