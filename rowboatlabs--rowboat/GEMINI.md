# Harbor — how it is built

Harbor is the Spaces server: orgs, spaces, members, an append-only log, three faces. This file is the mechanics — where things live, the invariants, the slice a capability cuts through, how to run and ship. What Spaces *is* and why is [SPEC.md](./SPEC.md); what the wire *means* is [CONTRACT.md](./CONTRACT.md). One kind of fact per document; link, never restate.

## Layout

Two pnpm workspace packages under `packages/`:

- **`protocol/`** — `@rowboat/spaces-protocol`, the contract: zod schemas imported by the server *and* the app, so drift is structurally impossible. `core.ts` (the objects), `ids.ts` (ids, the link grammar and its one parser), `changeset.ts`, `events.ts` (`SpaceEvent` and the live frames), `api.ts` (`routes`), `mcp.ts` (`mcpTools`), `mentions.ts`, `search.ts`, `invite.ts`, `errors.ts`, `fixtures/merge/` (the golden merge cases every engine must pass).
- **`server/`** — `@rowboat/harbor`:

| `src/` | Owns |
|---|---|
| `core/kernel.ts` | store, hub, org, the read-only knob, the space lock with its publish-after-commit outbox, `append` / `nextOffset` / `appendNext`, `requireSpace` / `requireReadableSpace` / `requireMember`, `guardWrite`, `attributionOf` |
| `core/spaces.ts` | spaces, direct messages, invites and the bind ceremony, the roster, `me`, agent members (`createAgent`), push registration, the read-gated replay and membership-gated live relays |
| `core/agents.ts` | agent members' owners and keys: add an agent, list the ones a member manages, create and revoke keys |
| `core/assets.ts` | assets by id, versions, the change log, blobs, history, diff |
| `core/feed.ts` | messages, threads, topics, reactions, polls, search, mention stamps and their backfill |
| `core/read-state.ts` | read marks, follows, unread, Activity, read-all |
| `service.ts` | `HarborService`, the facade: one delegate per public method, `org` / `readOnly` accessors |
| `policy.ts` | who may do what — pure decisions over facts the core loads; `enforce` throws |
| `store.ts`, `pg-store.ts` | the data boundary and its one driver; `PgStore.transaction(fn)` for an org-level all-or-nothing write the caller shares (`directory.ts`); `sql.ts` (node-postgres), `sql-pglite.ts` (Postgres in-process) |
| `migrations.ts` | the append-only schema ladder |
| `http.ts`, `ws.ts`, `mcp.ts` | the three faces; `origin.ts` (the public origin behind the proxy) |
| `auth.ts`, `auth-oidc.ts` | the drivers, `bindAuth` / `OrgAuth` (which resolves agent keys ahead of any driver), `authenticateRequest`, the RFC 9728 helpers; `consent.ts` (the login page); `agent-keys.ts` (minting and hashing an agent key) |
| `runtime.ts` | `buildOrgRuntime` — the one assembly of an org |
| `server.ts`, `main.ts` | `startHarbor` (one org) and the dev seed; the binary (dev, or `HARBOR_MODE=deployment`) |
| `deployment.ts`, `directory.ts`, `apex.ts` | many orgs from one process: host → org runtime; the org directory; the apex face (create org, my orgs) |
| `notify.ts`, `push.ts` | the one notification decision; Expo delivery |
| `hub.ts`, `blobs*.ts`, `mime.ts`, `merge.ts`, `search.ts`, `mentions-backfill.ts` | in-process fan-out, blob drivers, sniffing, the three-way merge, query parsing, the mentions backfill |
| `stats.ts`, `internal.ts` | the live-load counters (connections, subscriptions, frames per minute by kind, deliveries) and the operator face that reads them, `GET /internal/stats` behind `HARBOR_INTERNAL_KEY` |

`test/` has one file per feature, every one on in-process Postgres. `helpers.ts` gives `startTestHarbor` (a harbor over a fresh database, closed with it), `restClient`, `agentClient`, `liveClient`, `startFakeAs` (a fake authorization server: discovery, JWKS, minted JWTs). `day-in-the-life.test.ts` is spec §11 as code; `mcp-parity.test.ts` proves the agent face; `policy.test.ts` pins every rule without a store.

## Invariants

- **One core, three doors.** The faces hold `{ service, auth: OrgAuth }` and never the store. Rowboat's own agent uses the same MCP tools as any agent; there is no privileged path.
- **Rules live in `policy.ts`.** Every question of the form "may this actor do this to this space or message" is a pure decision there; the core loads the facts and asks; no face decides anything.
- **Reading and acting have separate gates (2026-09-23, spec §5).** `requireReadableSpace` loads the space, membership, and org member for `canReadSpace`; only shared open spaces admit nonmembers. `requireMember` and `lockedAs` retain the membership-only `canAccessSpace` rule. `requireOrgMember` guards browse/self-join. Durable events use the transaction outbox, never publish an uncommitted write.
- **Every write to the log runs inside the space lock (2026-09-25, PR #1121).** Membership-gated relays and personal state check the gate and act directly, without a transaction. A member's log write uses `k.lockedAs(ctx, spaceId, …)`, which re-verifies access inside the transaction, so a write that lost a race to a removal is refused, never landed; acts that create the membership themselves, and operator passes, use `k.locked`. On Postgres the lock is the transaction. Events go through `k.append` / `k.appendNext`, which hold frames until the commit returns, so a subscriber never sees an uncommitted fact or a rolled-back phantom.
- **The log is append-only, with two named exceptions.** Message deletion and message editing redact the stored event, because replay must never resurrect the text. Nothing else edits a stored event.
- **Migrations are append-only.** One concern per entry, never edit an applied one, arbitrary SQL is fine from 002. Generated columns belong to Postgres; code never writes them.
- **One store driver.** Tests and `pnpm dev` run the production SQL on PGlite. Do not add an in-memory store.
- **Parity.** Every member operation exists on both the render face and the agent face; `reason` is required on the agent face's file operations. `mcp-parity.test.ts` is where a new tool proves itself. The one exception is agent keys (2026-09-29): a secret never passes through a tool, so they are managed on the render face only.
- **Attribution is universal.** Every act is a member's, built by `k.attributionOf(ctx, input)`; `actingMode` records how, never who else. Author-only checks compare member ids, not modes: a member's agent counts as the member.
- **Org-scoped everything.** Member ids are org-scoped and every member-keyed table carries `org_id`; space ids are global ULIDs, so space-keyed tables need no org column and one hub serves every org.
- **Bytes-derived facts are the org's.** Mime, image dimensions, hashes — computed from the bytes at upload; a client's claim is a fallback, never a fact.
- **Conflicts are outcomes, errors are failures.** A stale base returns `conflict` with everything needed to retry; `HarborError` carries a contract `ErrorCode`.

## Adding a capability — the slice

Every feature cuts the same places, in this order. The DM feature (PR #984) is a complete worked example in `git log`.

1. **Protocol.** Types in `core.ts`; the route in `api.ts` (`routes.<name>` with params, query, request, response); the event in `events.ts` if it is a space fact; the tool in `mcp.ts`; a fixture under `fixtures/merge/` if merge behavior changes.
2. **Migration.** Append to `migrations.ts` as `0NN-<concern>`.
3. **Store.** The method on `store.ts`, its SQL in `pg-store.ts`.
4. **Policy.** If there is a who-may rule, a decision in `policy.ts` and a case in `policy.test.ts`.
5. **Core.** The method in the right aggregate under `core/`, in the shape below.
6. **Facade.** One delegate in `service.ts`.
7. **Faces.** The route in `http.ts` (`parseWith` for params and query, `body` for JSON, `reply` validates the response against the contract before it leaves); the case in `mcp.ts`'s `dispatch`.
8. **Tests.** A file under `test/` over `startTestHarbor`, speaking the wire through both faces where the operation has both.
9. **CONTRACT.md.** A dated bullet in the settled-semantics section saying what the wire means. `docs.test.ts` fails if a route or tool goes unmentioned.
10. **SPEC.md.** Only if a product rule changed: amend the section, dated.

The write-path shape every core method follows:

```ts
async renameSpace(ctx: ActorCtx, spaceId: string, input: RenameSpaceInput): Promise<Space> {
  const space = await this.k.requireMember(ctx, spaceId);   // gate: load the facts, policy decides
  enforce(canRenameSpace(space));                            // the rule, from policy.ts
  this.k.guardWrite();                                       // the org may be read-only
  const by = this.k.attributionOf(ctx, input);               // who, and how
  return this.k.lockedAs(ctx, spaceId, async () => {        // the space lock — the transaction; access re-verified inside
    const current = (await this.k.store.getSpace(spaceId)) ?? space;   // re-read inside it
    if (current.name === input.name) return current;         // idempotent no-op: no write, no event
    const updated: Space = { ...current, name: input.name };
    await this.k.store.putSpace(updated);
    await this.k.appendNext(spaceId, this.k.now(), { type: 'space_renamed', space: updated, by });
    return updated;                                          // frames leave the hub after the commit
  });
}
```

Preconditions about the object's state — a tombstone, a closed poll, a stale base, an occupied path — stay in the method. Rules about the actor or the space's kind go to `policy.ts`.

## Style

- Comments say **why**, with the date and the decision they implement — `(spec §4, amended 2026-08-19)`, `(PR #944)`. The code says what.
- The domain's names: member, space, asset, change-set, topic, stream, thread, root, offset. `Topic` on the wire, "Discussion" in the UI.
- Wire-visible behavior gets a test that speaks the wire, not a test of internals. Idempotent no-ops are tested as no-ops: no write, no event.
- Nothing speculative: no seat reserved for a rule that has no route yet.

## Run and test

```sh
cd apps/harbor
pnpm install
pnpm -r typecheck && pnpm -r test          # every test on in-process Postgres, about ten seconds
cd packages/server && pnpm dev             # one seeded org on :4272 — PGlite in memory, restart = clean slate
DATABASE_URL=postgres://… pnpm dev         # the same on durable Postgres
```

Dev auth is `Authorization: Bearer dev-<memberId>` (first sight creates the member; never expose it). `AUTH_ISSUER` switches to real OIDC; `AUTH_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` mounts the login page. After changing protocol or server code, restart `pnpm dev`: tsx loads source at start, and a stale server silently rejects new frame fields.

## Auth, as built

Harbor is only ever a **resource server**. A driver turns a bearer into an identity (`dev`, or `oidc`: pinned issuer, RFC 8414 discovery, JWKS-verified JWTs) and the org's identity table turns `(iss, sub)` into a member — never auto-created; a valid token with no mapping is `not_a_member`, and the invite-bind ceremony (`bindInvite`) is the one route that accepts it. The org serves RFC 9728 resource metadata and its 401s point at it, so MCP clients find the OAuth dance mechanically. The login page (`consent.ts`) is static HTML that drives the authorization server's consent state machine in the browser; Harbor never sees a credential.

Verified against Supabase Auth (2026-08-18/19), the flagship AS: tokens on a shared realm are realm-generic (`aud: "authenticated"`), so **membership is the authorization boundary**, not the audience; the consent flow is claim-then-approve (`GET /oauth/authorizations/{id}` before the `POST`); with DCR off the `registration_endpoint` disappears from discovery, so clients detect the policy mechanically; refresh tokens rotate on use; the OAuth server ships in GoTrue itself, so self-hosting needs no Supabase fleet.

## Ship

- `HARBOR_MODE=deployment` with `DATABASE_URL`, `APEX_DOMAIN`, `AUTH_ISSUER`; optional `AUTH_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, `BLOBS_S3_*` or `BLOBS_DIR`, `HARBOR_MAX_BLOB_BYTES`, `DATABASE_POOL_MAX`, `HARBOR_INTERNAL_KEY`. The `Dockerfile` header lists them. Migrations self-apply at boot under an advisory lock; orgs are created on the apex face.
- **Server before app.** A breaking wire change deploys the server first and the app build the same day; an additive change needs no coupling. Say which in the PR.
- **One instance.** The hub is in-process; a second instance partitions live delivery. Autoscaling stays off until the hub has a shared backend. `GET /internal/stats` with the operator key shows what the instance carries — connections, subscriptions, frames per minute by kind, deliveries — the numbers that say when one stops being enough; the same line lands in the log once a minute whether or not the key is set. When a second instance comes, the counters feed an OpenTelemetry push and the hub gets its bus in the same change.
- The S3 blob driver's conformance suite runs when `HARBOR_TEST_S3_BUCKET` is set; the disk driver's always.

## Before you open a PR

1. Did a **product rule** change? → amend the SPEC.md section, dated.
2. Did the **wire** change? → the protocol package and a dated CONTRACT.md bullet.
3. Did the **structure** change — a module, an invariant, the slice? → this file.
