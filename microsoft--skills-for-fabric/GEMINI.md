# Microsoft Fabric Development Rules for Windsurf

# Update Check: At session start, check for skills-for-fabric updates by reading the
# remote package.json version from https://github.com/microsoft/skills-for-fabric
# (via "git fetch origin main --quiet && git show origin/main:package.json"
# or GitHub API with authentication) and comparing with the local package.json
# version. Show changelog if update available.

project_context: |
  This project uses Microsoft Fabric for data engineering, warehousing, and analytics.
  Primary API reference: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/fabric/articles/
  All Fabric operations require Azure AD auth: run 'az login', then 'az account get-access-token --resource https://api.fabric.microsoft.com'.
  Repository layering is Agents -> Skills -> Common.
  For cross-endpoint orchestration (like medallion architecture), use agents/FabricDataEngineer.agent.md first, then delegate depth work to skills/.

best_practices:
  - Use parameterized notebooks and pipelines
  - Implement incremental processing over full refreshes
  - Document DAX measures with comments
  - Use REST APIs for programmatic Fabric management
  - Prefer Materialized Lake Views for durable Silver/Gold Lakehouse data products when the task is Spark/Lakehouse-centric.
