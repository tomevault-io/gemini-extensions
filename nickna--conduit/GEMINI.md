# ⚠️ CRITICAL: Safety First

## Commands That WILL Break Development

### ❌ FORBIDDEN WEBADMIN COMMANDS
**These commands break the development container and force a 5+ minute restart:**
- `npm run build` (anywhere in WebAdmin directory)
- `cd WebAdmin && npm run build`
- `./scripts/dev/dev-workflow.sh build-webadmin` (production testing only)

**Why?** The development container uses an isolated `.next` directory. Running `npm run build` on the host corrupts the container's build state.

### ✅ SAFE WEBADMIN VERIFICATION
Use these commands instead to verify WebAdmin changes:
- `npm run lint` - Check ESLint errors
- `npm run type-check` - Verify TypeScript types
- Hot reloading automatically validates code changes as you save files.

### ❌ FORBIDDEN DEVELOPMENT COMMANDS
- `docker compose up` for development (always use `./scripts/dev/start-dev.sh`)

**If you run forbidden commands, you will:**
1. Break the development environment.
2. Force a restart with `--clean` (which takes 5+ minutes).
3. Waste time and ignore explicit instructions.

# Quick Start Guide

## Starting Development Services

**⚠️ CANONICAL DEVELOPMENT STARTUP:**
```bash
./scripts/dev/start-dev.sh
```

### Available Flags
```bash
./scripts/dev/start-dev.sh              # Standard startup
./scripts/dev/start-dev.sh --webadmin   # Rebuild WebAdmin container
./scripts/dev/start-dev.sh --clean      # Complete reset (removes all volumes)
./scripts/dev/start-dev.sh --build      # Force rebuild with --no-cache
./scripts/dev/start-dev.sh --help       # Show usage
```

**Flag Details:**
- `--webadmin`: Restarts the WebAdmin container, which is useful for fixing Next.js issues or after adding new packages.
- `--clean`: Removes containers, volumes, `node_modules`, and build artifacts for a complete reset.
- `--build`: Rebuilds containers using the `--no-cache` flag.

## Available Services
After startup, these services are available:
- 🌐 **WebAdmin**: http://localhost:3000 (Next.js with hot reloading)
- 📚 **Gateway API Swagger**: http://localhost:5000/swagger
- 🔧 **Admin API Swagger**: http://localhost:5002/swagger
- 🐰 **RabbitMQ Management**: http://localhost:15672 (user: `conduit`, pass: `conduitpass`)

## Quick Verification
```bash
docker ps                              # Check running containers
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml logs -f [service]
```

# Development Environment

## How Development Works

### Key Features
- ✅ Node modules exist on the HOST, allowing direct `npm` command access.
- ✅ The `WebAdmin` directory is mounted for hot reloading.
- ✅ User ID mapping prevents permission issues by using your host UID/GID.
- ✅ Development containers use `node:22-alpine` directly.
- ✅ Isolated `.next` directories mean the container manages its own build state.

### Development vs Production

| Aspect | Development (`start-dev.sh`) | Production (`docker compose up`) |
|--------|------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| WebAdmin Container | `node:22-alpine` with mounted source | Built Next.js app in container |
| Hot Reloading | ✅ Enabled via volume mounts | ❌ Static build |
| User Permissions | Maps to host UID/GID | Runs as container user |
| Node Modules | Shared with host | Container-only |

## Helper Commands

### dev-workflow.sh
This script simplifies interaction with the development containers.
```bash
./scripts/dev/dev-workflow.sh logs                 # View WebAdmin logs in real-time
./scripts/dev/dev-workflow.sh shell                # Open a shell inside the WebAdmin container
./scripts/dev/dev-workflow.sh lint-fix-webadmin    # Run ESLint with --fix
./scripts/dev/dev-workflow.sh build-sdks           # Build all SDKs
./scripts/dev/dev-workflow.sh exec [command]       # Execute a custom command in the container
```

---

# Build & Verification

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Always Verify Builds

### WebAdmin Verification (SAFE)
**Never use `npm run build` in development - it breaks the container!**

```bash
cd WebAdmin
npm run lint         # Check for ESLint errors
npm run type-check   # Verify TypeScript types
```

### Backend & SDK Build Commands
```bash
# Full solution build
dotnet build

# Run all tests
dotnet test

# Build individual projects
dotnet build ConduitLLM.Gateway    # Gateway API
dotnet build ConduitLLM.Admin   # Admin API

# Build SDKs
cd SDKs/Node/Admin && npm run build
cd SDKs/Node/Core && npm run build
cd SDKs/Node/Common && npm run build
```

## Incremental Development Rules

1. **NEVER** make more than 3-5 file changes without verifying.
2. **ALWAYS** verify after **ANY** changes:
   - **WebAdmin**: `npm run lint` and `npm run type-check` ONLY.
   - **Backend/SDKs**: Use the appropriate build commands listed above.
3. **Fix ALL errors immediately** to avoid accumulating technical debt.
4. **Never commit code that doesn't verify cleanly.**

# Code Quality Standards

## WebAdmin ESLint Strict Rules

The WebAdmin enforces **very strict ESLint rules** that will cause build failures. Pay close attention to these:

### 1. Type Safety Rules
- `@typescript-eslint/no-unsafe-assignment`: Do not assign `any`/`unknown` without explicit type casting.
- `@typescript-eslint/no-unsafe-argument`: Do not pass `any`/`unknown` as function arguments.
- `@typescript-eslint/no-unsafe-member-access`: Do not access properties on `any` types.
- `@typescript-eslint/no-unsafe-return`: Do not return `any` types from functions.

### 2. Console Logging
- ✅ Only `console.warn` and `console.error` are allowed.
- ❌ `console.log` will cause build failures. Use `console.warn` for development debugging.

### 3. Type Casting Pattern
```typescript
// ❌ BAD - will fail ESLint
const data = event.data as MetricsData;

// ✅ GOOD - proper type narrowing
const data = event.data as unknown as MetricsData;

// ✅ BETTER - use a type guard
if (isMetricsData(event.data)) {
  // event.data is now correctly typed within this block
}
```

## C# Code Style Guidelines

### Naming Conventions
- Interfaces: Prefix with 'I' (e.g., `ILLMClient`).
- Async methods: Suffix with 'Async' (e.g., `GetValueAsync`).
- Private fields: Prefix with an underscore (`_logger`).
- Public members: PascalCase.
- Parameters: camelCase.

### Formatting
- Indentation: 4 spaces.
- Braces: Opening braces on a new line (Allman style).

# Architecture Essentials

## Database Migrations

**⚠️ CRITICAL: PostgreSQL Syntax ONLY**
- Use the standard EF Core workflow: `dotnet ef migrations add` → `dotnet ef database update`.
- All migration code must use PostgreSQL-compatible syntax (e.g., double quotes for identifiers, `true`/`false` for booleans).

## Provider Architecture

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: The system supports multiple providers of the same type (e.g., multiple OpenAI configurations). **Provider ID is the canonical identifier, not ProviderType.**
- **Provider ID**: The primary key for `Provider` records. Use this for all lookups and relationships.
- **ProviderType**: An enum that categorizes the provider's API type (e.g., `OpenAI`, `Groq`).

## WebAdmin API Architecture

The WebAdmin backend has a minimal API surface and relies on client-side SDK usage with ephemeral keys.
- **Only 3 API routes exist**: `/api/health`, `/api/auth/ephemeral-key`, and `/api/auth/ephemeral-master-key`.
- When creating new API routes:
    - ✅ Use `getServerAdminClient()` or `await getServerCoreClient()` to interact with backend services.
    - ✅ Wrap all SDK calls in `try/catch` and use `handleSDKError(error)`.
    - ❌ **Never** create SDK clients directly with `new ConduitAdminClient()`.
    - ❌ **Never** expose master keys or secrets to the client.

## Event-Driven Architecture

- The system uses **MassTransit** with RabbitMQ for asynchronous event processing.
- Events are used to ensure cache consistency and decouple services.

## Real-Time Updates

- **SignalR** provides real-time updates via WebSockets, with a Redis backplane for scaling.
- This is used for features like navigation state and media generation progress.
