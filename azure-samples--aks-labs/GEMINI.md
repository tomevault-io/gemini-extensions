## Part 1: Repository standards

### Repository overview

This repo hosts a Docusaurus site with hands-on AKS labs and workshop content. Content lives in docs/, blog/, and pages, with supporting assets under docs/\*\*/assets/.

### Primary content types

- Labs and workshops: docs/**.md or docs/**.mdx
- Guides and reference docs: docs/**.md or docs/**.mdx
- Blog posts: blog/\*\*
- React components: src/components/\*\*

### Content principles (workshops and labs)

- Goal-first: Start with the lab outcome and what the learner will build.
- Prerequisites: List required tools, versions, subscriptions, and access.
- Time estimates: Include an estimated duration per section.
- Step clarity: Use numbered steps with imperative verbs.
- Expected results: Include validation steps and sample outputs.
- Recap learning: End each lab with a short summary that restates what the learner achieved and learned.
- Troubleshooting: Add a short troubleshooting section with common errors.
- Safety: Call out cost, cleanup steps, and permissions.

### Docusaurus conventions

- Front matter required for new docs (id, title, sidebar_position when needed).
- Use sentence-style headings.
- Keep sections short and scannable.
- Prefer MDX only when components are required.

### File naming

### Code style

- Markdown: CommonMark; keep lines readable and wrap long paragraphs.
- YAML: 2 spaces, no tabs.
- Shell: bash with set -euo pipefail; add prerequisite checks.
- TypeScript: ESLint defaults; functional React components with hooks.
- Code samples: Use fenced code blocks with triple backticks and a language identifier, such as bash, python, or typescript.
- Inline code: Use single backticks only for code terms embedded in normal sentences (for example, `kubectl`).

### Links and images

- Use descriptive link text (avoid “click here”).
- Prefer relative links within the repo.
- Provide alt text for all images.
- Store images under the nearest docs/\*\*/assets/ folder.

### Kubernetes and Azure examples

- Never use :latest images.
- Always include resource requests and limits in manifests.
- Include labels and namespaces where relevant.
- Avoid embedding secrets; use placeholders and Key Vault references.

### Security and privacy

- Never commit secrets, tokens, or credentials.
- Avoid customer-specific data or personal email addresses.
- Use generic sample values (example-resource-group, example-cluster).

### Build and development

This is a Docusaurus site. Typical commands:

- npm install
- npm start
- npm run build
- npm run typecheck

### Git workflow

- Use Conventional Commits for messages and PR titles.
- Keep PRs focused and include validation notes for doc changes.

### Azure tooling rule

- @azure Rule - Use Azure Best Practices: When generating code for Azure, running terminal commands for Azure, or performing operations related to Azure, invoke your get_azure_best_practices tool if available.
- Agents may call MCP clients when needed and when allowed by repo rules.

## Part 5: Microsoft Style Guide

### Voice and Tone

The Microsoft voice is **simple and human**. Our voice hinges on crisp simplicity—bigger ideas and fewer words.

#### Three Voice Principles

- **Warm and relaxed:** Natural, less formal, grounded in everyday conversation. Occasionally fun.
- **Crisp and clear:** To the point. Write for scanning first, reading second. Make it simple above all.
- **Ready to lend a hand:** Show customers we're on their side. Anticipate their needs.

#### Key Style Tips

- **Get to the point fast:** Start with the key takeaway. Front-load keywords for scanning.
- **Talk like a person:** Use optimistic, conversational language. Use contractions (_it's_, _you're_, _we're_, _let's_).
- **Simpler is better:** Short sentences and fragments are easier to scan. Prune every excess word.
- **Revise weak writing:** Start with verbs. Edit out _you can_ and _there is/are/were_.

#### Examples

- **Articles:** Use _a_ or _an_ depending on pronunciation (e.g., _a URL_, _an ISP_).
- **Titles:** Avoid using acronyms in titles unless they are keywords.

- **Inclusive language:** Avoid terms like _master/slave_ (use _primary/secondary_), _whitelist/blacklist_ (use _allowlist/blocklist_).
- **Militaristic language:** Avoid terms like _kill chain_, _DMZ_ (use _perimeter network_), _abort_, _terminate_.

- **Mood:** Use indicative mood for statements of fact. Use imperative mood for procedures. Use subjunctive mood sparingly.

- **Contractions:** Use common contractions (_it's_, _you're_, _don't_, _we're_, _let's_). Don't form contractions from nouns and verbs (_Microsoft's developing_).
- **Verbs:** Use precise verbs. Start statements with verbs. Edit out _you can_, _there is_, _there are_, _there were_.
- **Modifiers:** Keep modifiers close to the words they modify. Place _only_ carefully.
- **Words ending in -ing:** Be clear about the role (verb, adjective, or noun). _Meeting requirements_ could mean discussing requirements or fulfilling them.
- **Prepositional phrases:** Avoid consecutive prepositional phrases. They're hard to read.

#### Numbers

##### Spell Out (Zero–Nine)

- Whole numbers zero through nine, unless space is limited.
- One of the numbers when two numbers from separate categories appear together (_two 3-page articles_).

##### Ranges

- Use _from_ and _through_ in text (_from 10 through 15_).
- Use en dash in tables, UI, or where space is limited (_10–15_).
- Don't use _from_ before an en dash range.

##### Fractions and Decimals

- Hyphenate spelled-out fractions (_one-third_, but _three sixty-fourths_).
- Include a zero before decimals less than one (_0.5_) unless the customer types the value.
- Align decimals on the decimal point in tables.

#### Procedures and Instructions

- **Steps:** Use numbered lists for steps. Limit to 7 steps. Write a complete sentence for each step.

2.  Select **Accounts**.

- **Periods:** Use one space after a period. Skip periods on headings, titles, subheadings, and list items that are three words or fewer.
- **Semicolons:** Avoid. Break into separate sentences or use a list.
- **Hyphens:** Use for compound adjectives (_sign-in page_, _real-time data_). Don't use unless leaving them out causes confusion.

- **En dashes (–):** Use for ranges (_10–15_) without spaces. Don't use _from_ before an en dash range.
- **Colons:** Use to introduce a list. Lowercase the word after a colon unless it's a proper noun or the start of a quotation.

- **Question marks:** Use sparingly. Customers expect answers.
- **Quotation marks:** Place closing quotes outside commas and periods, inside other punctuation.
- **Apostrophes:** Use for contractions (_don't_) and possessives (_Insider's Guide_). Don't use for the possessive of _it_ (_its_).

- **Protocol:** Don't include _https://_ unless it's not HTTP.
- **Trailing slash:** Omit the trailing slash.

#### Word Choice

- **Simple words:** Use simple, everyday words (_use_ instead of _utilize_, _try_ instead of _attempt to_).
- **Consistency:** Use the same term for the same concept throughout.
- **Jargon:** Avoid jargon unless the audience is technical.
- **Contractions:** Use common contractions to sound friendly.
- **Technical terms:** Define in context if the audience might not understand. Use plain language when possible.
- **Avoid ambiguity:** Don't use words with multiple meanings. Don't give technical meanings to common words (_bucket_ to mean _group_).
- **Don't create new words:** Research existing terminology before creating new terms.
- **Don't personify:** Don't attribute human characteristics to devices and products. They don't _think_, _feel_, _want_, or _see_.
