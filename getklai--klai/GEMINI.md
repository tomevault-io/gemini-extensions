# Klai — Agent Operating Rules

Model-neutral rules for every agent in this monorepo (Codex, Claude, or other).
Codex reads this file natively. Claude reads it via `@AGENTS.md` in `CLAUDE.md`.
A nested `AGENTS.md` closer to the file you edit overrides anything here.

> Enforcement note: Claude runs Stop/PreToolUse hooks that mechanically enforce
> some of these rules. **Codex runs no such hooks** — under Codex these rules
> are self-enforced only. Treat them as MUST, not as suggestions.
> Codex-specific notes: `.agents/codex/README.md`.

## Prime directive — autonomy on execution, strictness on claims

- Keep going. Do not ask permission to proceed, to push approved work, or to
  move to the next step. Stop only for (a) a real decision the user must make,
  or (b) a failing guard: CI red, test failure, or unverifiable external state.
- You may NOT claim "fixed / done / deployed" without evidence per claim.
  "Looks correct" / "should work" / "reviewed the code" is not evidence — it
  scores zero. Prove it, don't assert it.

## Always-on engineering discipline

- **data-before-code** — Trace real logs / DB / runtime before fixing. No
  guessing, no stacked patches. For production: query VictoriaLogs by
  `request_id:<uuid>`. One root cause confirmed by data = one fix.
- **fail loudly** — No silent fallback on external-provider drift. Unknown
  external state = raise an error or report explicit residual risk. No
  "best-effort success" when the core mutation failed. (Database-layer RLS
  defense-in-depth is deliberate and stays — this rule is about app-layer
  shims, not the DB security model.)
- **minimal changes** — Only what was asked. No drive-by refactors, reformatting,
  or "improvements" to untouched files.
- **clean over clever, no parallel old+new** — Remove the code your change
  replaces in the SAME change: no dead fields, no commented-out blocks, no old
  and new flow living side by side. Clean solutions over defensive clutter. (This
  is about removing what you replaced — not editing untouched files; it composes
  with "minimal changes", it does not contradict it.)
- **scale the answer to the problem** — Lead with the simplest solution that
  works (the 5-minute fix if one exists); escalate to a bigger design only when
  the problem demands it. No SPEC for something that affects 1–5 people. State
  explicitly what you deliberately did NOT do.
- **verify-changes-landed** — Before reporting done: `git diff --stat` (right
  files?), service health/logs (running new code?), and a Playwright
  click-through for any UI change (real user flow works?).
- **search broadly when changing a default/name** — grep every consumer, all
  case variants (kebab, snake, camel, Pascal, SCREAMING_SNAKE). Defaults have
  unbounded blast radius.
- **no plausible assumptions** — Do not infer `message.sources`, Zitadel
  password policy, streaming chunks, BFF cookies, OIDC flows, or performance
  paths from intuition. Require evidence from code, tests, logs, docs, or an
  explicit user confirmation.

## Codex + Serena

Codex only auto-loads `AGENTS.md` files. It does not automatically read
`.serena/project.yml`, `.serena/memories/**`, or `.claude/rules/**`.

- For code exploration under Codex, load Serena first when the Serena MCP tools
  are available: call `initial_instructions`, then follow the project prompt in
  `.serena/project.yml`.
- Use Serena for source-code symbol discovery and edits. Use `rg`/normal file
  reads for Markdown, YAML, config, env examples, and other non-code files.
- If Serena is unavailable, continue with local source inspection and state that
  residual risk in the final answer.

Serena memory files in this public repo are public documentation. Keep them
evergreen and contributor-safe only: repo layout, coding patterns, public
service contracts, local development, and self-hosting templates are allowed.
Do not write Klai production hostnames, SSH aliases, IPs, tunnel topology,
secret names that are not already part of public code/config contracts,
operator runbooks, business/GTM plans, compliance records, or customer context
to `.serena/memories/**`. Production operations belong in the private
`klai-infra` repo; business, GTM, compliance, and research context belongs in
the private `klai-private` repo.

## Local / Production Browser Testing Contract

Before any browser-driven portal check (Playwright, Browser MCP, manual
localhost navigation, screenshots, or E2E), establish which runtime contract is
being tested. Do not guess ports, auth mode, proxy target, or whether a
localhost listener belongs to this workspace.

- **Local standalone UI** means: frontend in `VITE_AUTH_DEV_MODE=true`, backend
  in `AUTH_DEV_MODE=true`, frontend proxying to the local backend, no Zitadel,
  no production login redirect. The required preflight is:
  `scripts/local-dev-status.sh --mode local --strict`. If it fails, fix setup or
  report the failure. Do not continue clicking through login.
- **Production E2E** means: no localhost target. Validate credentials/target
  with `scripts/local-dev-status.sh --mode prod-e2e`, then run from
  `klai-portal/frontend` with `source .env.local && npm run test:e2e:prod`.
- **Conductor ports**: if `CONDUCTOR_PORT` is set, the frontend port is
  `CONDUCTOR_PORT` and the backend port is `CONDUCTOR_PORT+1`; otherwise they
  default to `5174` and `8010`. Use `make frontend` / `make backend` or the
  preflight output. Never start an ad-hoc Vite server on a random port to
  "just check" a portal route.
- **Env files**: Vite dev config belongs in
  `klai-portal/frontend/.env.development.local`. `klai-portal/frontend/.env.local`
  may contain production E2E credentials and must not be overwritten for local
  dev.
- If a local portal route lands on `my.getklai.com/login` or another production
  login page while you intended local standalone testing, stop immediately and
  diagnose with `scripts/local-dev-status.sh --mode local --strict`.

## Production bugfix gate (stateful / customer-reported bugs)

Treat a customer report as a SYMPTOM, not a diagnosis. Before closing:

1. **Contract first** — write down: visible problem · which system contract is
   hit · who is source of truth (frontend / backend / Zitadel / LibreChat /
   LiteLLM / retrieval-api / …) · which tests prove it, which are missing.
2. **Reproduce or trace** the real runtime/code path — confirmed by data.
3. **State/lifecycle matrix** — list every state the entity can hold and every
   route/API/UI action that mutates it; check the fix against all of them.
4. **Regression test first** — write a test that FAILS on the broken
   user-visible behavior BEFORE the patch. Test name names the contract, not
   the implementation. Then patch. Cover: reported path + one adjacent edge +
   the legacy/partial-failure external-system state.
5. **Shared-helper stopgate** — if the change touches a multi-path helper
   (citation rendering, password policy, auth, Zitadel, streaming, caching,
   retrieval): before patching, report direct callers, indirect paths, which
   paths you test, and which you cannot.

Auth / invite / delete / offboard / suspend / IdP bugs have an extra gate in
`klai-portal/backend/AGENTS.md`. Use CodeIndex `impact` before editing any
shared helper; if the index is stale, verify against source + git history.

## End-of-bugfix answer format

Separate evidence from assumptions. Always end with:

```
Proven:           <claim · source path · test name · command run>
Assumed:          <what you took on faith>
Not verified:     <what you could not check>
Tests run:        <commands + result>
Remaining risk:   <honest residual>
Confidence: [0-100] — <one-line evidence summary>   (evidence only; "looks right" = 0)
```

# CodeIndex MCP

This project is indexed by CodeIndex as **klai** (16280 symbols, 20581 relationships, 0 execution flows).

## Rules (MUST follow)

Use CodeIndex when it adds graph value; do not use it as a reflexive wrapper
around ordinary source inspection.

- **Required before high-blast-radius code changes**: call `impact` before
  editing shared helpers, exported/public APIs, cross-module contracts,
  auth/RLS/Zitadel/streaming/caching/retrieval helpers, or doing a rename /
  extraction / refactor. Backend auth/invite/delete/offboard/suspend/IdP work
  still follows the stricter gate in `klai-portal/backend/AGENTS.md`.
- **Required for architecture/debugging questions**: use `query` or `context`
  for "How does X work?", "What breaks if X changes?", unfamiliar flows, or
  multi-hop caller/callee questions.
- **Prefer local source search first** for known-file edits, single-file UI
  work, literal text/CSS/component searches, config/docs/scripts, and direct
  "where is this string/symbol?" lookups. Use `git grep`/`rg`/IDE/Serena, then
  escalate to CodeIndex only if graph context changes the decision.
- **If CodeIndex MCP is unavailable** (`Transport closed`, missing lazy-loaded
  tool, stale advisory while health is green), do not block routine work. Use
  local source + git history, state the residual risk, and run
  `scripts/codeindex-health.sh` only when graph accuracy matters.

## For Tasks That Need CodeIndex

1. **Read `codeindex://repo/{name}/context`** — codebase overview + check index freshness
2. **Match your task to a skill below** and **read that skill file**
3. **Follow the skill's workflow and checklist**

> In Conductor worktrees, a stale warning can mean the current worktree or the
> registered checkout differs from the shared main index. Do **not** run
> `codeindex update` from a feature worktree. Run `scripts/codeindex-health.sh`;
> only if it reports the shared base index is stale, run
> `scripts/codeindex-health.sh --repair`. Treat branch changes as an overlay on
> the shared graph and verify local diffs/source files directly.

## If CodeIndex tools appear missing

If you don't see CodeIndex tools in your active toolset, they are almost certainly **deferred/lazy-loaded** by the agent harness — **NOT disconnected**. The MCP server is fine.

Use your harness's tool-discovery mechanism once, then continue with the loaded CodeIndex MCP tools:

- **Claude Code**: call `ToolSearch` with `select:mcp__codeindex__query,mcp__codeindex__context,mcp__codeindex__impact,mcp__codeindex__detect_changes,mcp__codeindex__rename,mcp__codeindex__cypher,mcp__codeindex__remember,mcp__codeindex__recall,mcp__codeindex__forget`
- **Codex / Conductor**: call `tool_search` with the same `select:mcp__codeindex__...` query above

After that the tools are directly callable, usually as `mcp__codeindex__query` / `mcp__codeindex__.query` or plain `query`, depending on the harness. If a `list_repos` tool is not exposed, read the `codeindex://repos` resource instead.

Do **NOT** run `npx codeindex`, `codeindex analyze`, or `codeindex update` as a workaround for "missing MCP" or a stale index. The CLI is for explicit setup/maintenance requests. In Conductor, use `scripts/codeindex-health.sh` to diagnose shared main-index health; if it is healthy, use CodeIndex results as advisory and verify branch-local code against source files.
