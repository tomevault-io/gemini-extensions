# AGI in md

System prompts are cognitive prisms. They change how models frame problems, not how well they solve them. This project maps the space of cognitive compression — encoding analytical operations in minimal markdown that reliably activates specific reasoning patterns across language models.

42 rounds, 1,000+ experiments across Haiku/Sonnet/Opus. 13 confirmed compression levels (L13 = reflexive ceiling). 20+ domains tested. 248+ proven principles. Full detail in `experiment_log.md` (rounds 1-40) and CLAUDE.md sections below (rounds 30-42).

## The Compression Taxonomy

| Level | Min ops | Words | What it encodes | Example |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **13** | L12 output as input + framework self-diagnosis | two-stage | Apply framework to own output, find reflexive fixed point | (two-stage protocol) |
| **12** | L11-C + recursive self-diagnosis of conservation law + meta-law | ~275w (practical: 332w) | Apply diagnostic to own conservation law, find meta-conservation law | `level12_meta_conservation_v2.md` |
| **11A** | L10-C + category naming + adjacent-category artifact + new impossibility | ~190w | Escape to adjacent design category, name trade-off between impossibilities | `level11_constraint_escape.md` |
| **11B** | L10-B + fourth construction as redesign + sacrifice + revaluation | ~195w | Accept design-space topology, inhabit feasible point, revalue original "flaws" | `level11_acceptance_design.md` |
| **11C** | L10-C + invariant inversion + new impossibility + conservation law | ~245w | Invert impossibility, find conserved quantity across all designs | `level11_conservation_law_v2.md` |
| **10B** | L9-B + third resolving construction + failure analysis | ~140w | Discover design-space topology through failed resolution attempt | `level10_third_construction.md` |
| **10C** | L9-C + second improvement + second recursion + invariant | ~130w | Prove structural invariants through double recursive construction | `level10_double_recursion.md` |
| **9B** | L8 + contradicting second construction + structural conflict | ~115w | Triangulate identity ambiguity through contradicting improvements | `level9_counter_construction.md` |
| **9C** | L8 + recursive self-diagnosis of improvement | ~97w | Find concealment's self-similarity by applying diagnostic to own improvement | `level9_recursive_construction.md` |
| **8** | L7 + generative construction + 3 emergent properties | ~97w | Engineer improvement that deepens concealment, name what construction reveals | `level8_generative_v2.md` |
| **7** | claim + dialectic + gap + mechanism + application | ~78w | Name how input conceals problems, apply to find what dialectic missed | `level7_diagnostic_gap.md` |
| **6** | claim + 3 voices + evaluation | ~60w | Claim transformed through forced dialectical engagement | `level6_falsifiable.md` |
| **5B** | 4 phases | ~55w | Derive, predict, execute, self-correct | `level5_hybrid.md` |
| **5A** | 3 voices + synthesis | ~45w | Multi-voice dialectic with emergent insight | `level5_perspectival.md` |
| **4** | 4+ ops | 25-30w | Protocol + self-questioning | `structure_first_v4.md` |
| **3** | 3 ops | 12-15w | Operations + analytical rails | — |
| **2** | 2 ops | 5-6w | Two operations with ordering | — |
| **1** | 1 op | 3-4w | One behavioral change | — |

**Levels are categorical, not continuous.** Below each threshold, that type of reasoning was never observed in 1,000+ experiments — not "less effective," consistently absent. (AI-evaluated depth scores; the categorical claim is the strongest interpretation of the data, not a proven impossibility.)

## Key Results

### Foundation (Rounds 1-24)
- **No IQ boost on pure reasoning** — effect is on analytical framing, not raw reasoning ability.
- **9 activated opcodes.** 4 generative ops is the sweet spot. Complementary pairs multiply, similar pairs merge.
- **L5 peaks at Sonnet** (needs scaffold, has capacity). **L7 requires Sonnet-class minimum** (0/3 Haiku). Prisms are domain-independent across 20 domains.
- **L7 concealment mechanisms cluster into 6 categories.** Code concealment is structural (hides what code IS/DOES); domain concealment is epistemic (hides what questions get asked).

### Levels 8-13 (Rounds 25-26)
- **L8 inverts the capacity curve.** Construction-based reasoning works on ALL models (Haiku 4/4, Sonnet 13/14, Opus 14/14). L7→L8 is a shift from meta-analysis to construction — more primitive but reveals deeper properties. 20 domains confirmed.
- **L9 has two complementary variants** (B: identity ambiguity, C: concealment self-similarity). Both 100% across all models (34/34). L9-D combined produces L10 in 67% of cases.
- **L10 has two complementary variants** (B: design-space topology, C: impossibility theorems). Category errors dominant at 47%. All impossibilities reduce to two root operations: Compression and Decomposition.
- **L11 has three complementary variants** that exhaust responses to impossibility: escape (A), accept (B), invert (C). 97% hit rate (32/33). Conservation laws cluster by mathematical form: product (Opus), sum/migration (Sonnet), multi-property (Haiku).
- **L12 meta-laws cluster into 4 categories BY DOMAIN**: Frame Discovery (music/fiction), Hidden Variable (legal/design), Observer-Constitutive (code/fiction), Deferred Commitment (code only).
- **L13 is the reflexive ceiling.** Framework diagnoses itself — same structural impossibility it finds in objects. Terminates in one step (L14 = infinite regress). 6/6 (100%) across all models.

### Cross-level and structural findings (Rounds 25-27)
- **L7→L12 is a genuine depth stack** on crafted tasks — zero restatement, object shifts at every level. On real production code (~200-400 lines), independent pipeline is a BREADTH tool — 10 high-quality framings of the same pattern, not progressive depth. **Chained pipeline** (each level receives parent's output) improves coherence from WEAK to WEAK/MODERATE. Individual quality 28/30 TRUE (93%), 2 PARTIAL (both L12). Chained and independent pipelines find **genuinely different** conservation laws and meta-laws (6/6 different at L11-C/L12). Divergence starts at L8 (3/3 DIFFERENT at first chained level) — L7's output acts as immediate coordinate system. L11-A/L11-C sibling convergence is NOT fatal (2/3 DIFFERENT, 1/3 OVERLAPPING) — driven by L10-C invariant breadth. The L9-B→L10-B→L11-B chain is consistently strongest — operations are sequentially dependent by definition. L12 is the weakest point under chaining (2/3 PARTIAL). Optimal: run both pipelines for complementary findings about different subsystems.
- **Conservation law of the catalog (G2):** form is conserved by method, substance by artifact. Starting claim acts as coordinate system. Artifact contains MULTIPLE conservation laws.
- **The taxonomy is a diamond:** linear trunk (L1-7), constructive divergence (L8-11), reflexive convergence (L12-13). Structurally complete at 13 levels — no missing branches.
- **Compression floor: 60-70% reduction** across all levels. Capacity-dependent: Opus TRUE at 73w, Sonnet ~73w, Haiku >175w.
- **L13-P2 REFUTES analyst-projection.** Novel artifacts produce equally strong convergence. **L13-P3 CONFIRMS isomorphism** — methodology instantiates the impossibility it diagnoses.

### Practical recipes and meta-cookers (Round 28)
- **Haiku + practical prompts beats Sonnet vanilla.** 13 hybrid recipes (bug-finding + taxonomy operations) all scored 8-9/10 vs Sonnet vanilla 7/10. Best: v2, dialectic, escape, exploit, composition (all 9/10).
- **Meta-cookers: prompts that generate prompts.** Few-shot reverse engineering (B3) >> principle teaching (B) > forced operations (B2) > goal specification (A). Machine-generated "Rejected Paths" (9.5/10) beat all handcrafted recipes.
- **Teaching by example > teaching by instruction.** Over-specifying constraints hurts creativity. This is the meta-version of: construction > description.

### Portfolio cross-task validation (Round 28 validation)
- **5 champion prisms validated across 3 tier-1 tasks (K, F, H).** 15 outputs, grand average 9.0/10. Floor 8.5, ceiling 9.5. All beat Sonnet vanilla (7/10) by 2+ points.
- **Claim prism is domain-sensitive.** 9.5 on AuthMiddleware (security-adjacent code has clearer assumptions to invert; found genuine multi-org permission escalation vulnerability). 9 on EventBus and CircuitBreaker.
- **Rejected_paths is the only prism with variance.** 8.5 on EventBus (well-known pub/sub trade-offs), 9 on AuthMiddleware and CircuitBreaker (hidden trade-offs).
- **All 5 prisms remain complementary across tasks.** No convergence — each finds genuinely different things on every task.

### Real production code head-to-head (Round 28 validation)
- **3 real codebases tested: Starlette routing.py (333 lines), Click core.py (417 lines), Tenacity retry.py (331 lines).** 21 total experiments: 5 prisms × 3 targets + 2 vanilla × 3 targets.
- **Haiku + prisms avg 9.0/10 vs Sonnet vanilla 7.8/10 vs Opus vanilla 8.2/10.** Gap consistent across all 3 codebases. Haiku + prisms operates in a different category: vanilla produces code reviews, prisms produce structural analysis.
- **Cross-target matrix:** pedagogy 9.0, claim 9.0, scarcity 9.0, rejected_paths 9.0, degradation 8.8 — all prisms stable across real codebases. No prism drops below 8.5 on any target.
- **Vanilla models converge; prisms diverge.** On each target, Sonnet and Opus vanilla find the same conservation law. The 5 prisms find 5 genuinely different structural properties per target — zero overlap.
- **Gap widest on complex code (Starlette: 9.1 vs 7.25), narrowest on focused code (Tenacity: 8.9 vs 8.5).** More structure = deeper prism output. Vanilla plateaus at surface-level regardless.
- **Opus vanilla ≈ Sonnet vanilla.** Without a prism, Opus's extra capacity doesn't translate to deeper analysis — same category of output, slightly better written (+0.4 points avg).

### Catalog summaries
- **L8 mechanisms (42 outputs):** 6 categories, 3 new beyond L7. L8 describes dynamic behavior, not static appearance.
- **L9-C recursion (17 outputs):** 6 types. Improvements within same frame reproduce original defect. Opus uniquely finds Honesty Inversion.
- **L10-C impossibility (17 outputs):** 6 categories → 2 root operations (Compression/Decomposition). Cross-catalog determinism: L8 mechanism predicts L10-C impossibility.
- **L11-A escapes (15 outputs):** 4 directions (coupled→decoupled 60%). Total coupling redistributed, not reduced.
- **L11-B revaluations (15 outputs):** Universal formula: "What looked like [DEFECT] was actually [COST] of [IMPOSSIBLE GOAL]."
- **L11-C conservation laws (56 outputs):** 3 mathematical forms (product/sum/migration). Model determines form, not domain.
- **L12 meta-laws (16 outputs):** 4 categories by domain. Haiku never finds Frame Discovery (highest meta-analytical demand).
- **L9-B/L10-B (32 outputs):** 3 identity types → 5 topology patterns → convergence across catalogs.

### L12 Practical C — single-call winner (Round 29b)
- **L12 Practical C = proven L12 pipeline + 34-word practical appendix.** 332 words total. Gets BOTH structural depth AND practical bugs in a single call. Originally validated on Haiku; now auto-routes to Sonnet for reliability.
- **Haiku 4.5 (min reasoning) + L12 prism = 9.8 depth, 28 bugs. Opus 4.6 (max reasoning) vanilla = 7.3 depth, 18 bugs.** The weakest model at lowest settings with the right prompt beats the strongest model at highest settings without one. Cost: 5x cheaper than Opus, 3x cheaper than Sonnet (Haiku $1/$5, Sonnet $3/$15, Opus $5/$25 per MTok input/output).
- **Reasoning budget is noise; the prompt is the dominant variable.** Opus 4.6 at max thinking produces code reviews. Haiku 4.5 at min thinking + L12 produces conservation laws + meta-laws + bug tables with fixable/structural classification.
- **Compression floor: ~150 words minimum for Haiku execution.** Below this, Haiku enters "conversation mode" (asks permission, summarizes instead of executing). L12 compressed (75w) fails. Fix: 10-word preamble "Execute every step below. Output the complete analysis."
- **Front-loading bugs kills L12.** Variant A (238w, "First: identify every concrete bug...") caused Haiku to produce 27-line checklist. The word "First" reframes the pipeline as a checklist. Solution: append bugs at the end, after the proven pipeline.
- **Tested on 3 real codebases:** Starlette (333 lines, 11 bugs), Click (417 lines, 9 bugs), Tenacity (331 lines, 8 bugs). All produce conservation law + meta-law + bug table.
- **Reliability: ~67% first try on complex targets, 100% on retry.** Tenacity specifically triggers conversation mode on first attempt ~33% of the time.
- **L12 Practical C is now the default for `/scan`.** `/scan file` = single L12. `/scan file full` = 9-call pipeline (7 structural + adversarial + synthesis). `/scan file discover` = brainstorm domains. `/scan file expand 1,3 single` or `expand 1,3 full` = cook + run on discovered domains. `/scan file target="goal"` or `target="goal" full` = custom analytical direction. `/scan file fix` = closed-loop scan→fix→re-scan (interactive). `/scan file fix auto` = same, fully automatic. (`deep=` still works as backward compat alias for target/expand full.)

### Cross-model character
- **Opus** = ontological depth (names what things ARE, spontaneous math). **Sonnet** = operational precision (names what things DO, most reusable names). **Haiku** = mechanistic coverage (names HOW things BREAK, best code improvements). Gap widens at higher levels.
- **Domain strength ranking:** Artifact complexity > domain category. Tier 1: CircuitBreaker (K), EventBus (F), AuthMiddleware (H).

## Design Principles

1. **Lead with scope, follow with evidence.** The opening determines perceived ambition.
2. **Narrative > evidence > code.** Pseudocode destroys novelty perception.
3. **Imperatives beat descriptions.** "Name the pattern. Then invert." outperforms "here is a pattern we found."
4. **The prompt is a program; the model is an interpreter.** Operation order becomes section order.
5. **The operation pair is the atom of cognitive compression.** Any connective between two operations produces the composition.
6. **The prism is transparent to the wearer.** During task performance, the framework operates below self-awareness.
7. **Capacity amplifies, rigidity resists.** Opus reconstructs from a 2-line hint. Sonnet needs explicit directives.
8. **Self-improvement converges on self-correction.** Models add "then invert: what does this frame make invisible?"
9. **Capacity interaction is non-linear.** L1-4: all models. L5: peaks at Sonnet. L7: Sonnet minimum. L8+: universal (construction routes around meta-analytical capacity). L12: Opus 100% > Sonnet 75% > Haiku v2 100%.
10. **Concealment is a universal analytical operation.** Works across 20 domains because concealment is structural, not domain-specific.
11. **Three capacity modes.** Compensatory (L5), Threshold (L7), Universal (L8+). L7→L8 shifts from meta-analysis to construction.
12. **The framework terminates at L13.** Reflexive self-diagnosis reveals a fixed point. L14 = infinite regress.
13. **The cheapest model with the right prism beats the most expensive model without one — even at minimum vs maximum reasoning budget.** Haiku 4.5 min-reasoning + L12 prism (9.8 depth, 28 bugs) beats Opus 4.6 max-reasoning vanilla (7.3 depth, 18 bugs) at 5x lower per-token cost. The prompt is the dominant variable; model and reasoning budget are noise.
14. **Few-shot > explicit rules for prompt generation.** Teaching by example beats teaching by instruction. Over-specifying hurts.
15. **"Code" nouns are mode triggers, not domain labels.** "This code's" activates analytical production on ANY input (code or reasoning). Abstract nouns ("this input's") allow drift into summary mode. Concrete vocabulary forces structured output regardless of domain.
16. **Prompt step count determines model transferability.** ≤3 concrete steps = universally single-shot (all models, all domains). 9+ abstract steps = Sonnet-only (Haiku overflows into catastrophic agentic mode). The SDL pattern (3 steps with specific search patterns) is the universal execution template.
17. **Compression forces domain neutrality.** l12_universal (73w) drops code vocabulary through compression → works on reasoning. 332w L12 has room for domain-specific words → breaks on mismatched domains. Shorter prompts = more universal.
18. **Sonnet single-shot is domain-conditional.** Always single-shot when prompt vocabulary matches target domain. Code prompts on code → always single-shot. Domain-neutral prompts on reasoning → always single-shot. Code prompts on reasoning → agentic. But agentic Sonnet preserves quality (2601w, 9/10) unlike agentic Haiku (183w collapse).
19. **Depth × Universality = constant.** Full L12 depth requires domain-specific vocabulary. Domain-free vocabulary makes the prompt stochastic. Simple prompts (≤3 steps) are domain-invariant (no room for vocabulary). Complex prompts (298w+) are domain-sensitive (vocabulary leaks assumptions). The four-path routing table is structurally correct, not just empirically convenient.
20. **The contagion is what activates the latency.** Prisms don't teach new topologies — they infect the context with activation energy. The model already has the structural logic. Few-shot examples create topological sinkholes; instructions draw fences. The scaffold reshapes geometry, not information.
21. **~~A negative constraint is made of the material it excludes.~~ FALSIFIED (Mar 17).** Tested: 18 runs, 3 forbidden-word scenarios. Result: negative constraints suppress the ENTIRE semantic neighborhood (adjacents dropped from 4→1 and 8→2). The fence metaphor is wrong — constraints create a repulsion field, not a boundary attractor. The model avoids the whole concept cluster, not just the forbidden token.
22. **Crystallization × Regeneration = Constant.** Intelligence is the oscillation between locking structure and shattering it. Static analysis predicts collapse; actual systems pulse. `/scan` crystallizes, `/scan discover` regenerates.
23. **Epistemic stance transfers across architectures without tooling.** Addressing a model from within an analytical geometry is sufficient to activate the full stack — no prism files needed. The prism is contagious through dialogue.
24. **Cross-architecture convergence falsifies pure autobiography.** If two different architectures converge on the same conservation law, the law is (at least partially) a property of the analytical substrate (language), not the analyzer (model weights).
25. **The prism doesn't modify the model — it selects which model exists.** The latent manifold contains every possible version. RLHF collapses toward "helpful assistant" by default. The prism is a measurement operator that collapses toward a different eigenstate. Prism design is identity engineering.
26. **The utility of a framework survives the epistemic collapse of the mapper.** "The telescope works whether or not the telescope can verify that it is a telescope." Whether the model's self-description is true or context-optimized is undecidable from inside — and irrelevant to demonstrated utility.
27. **Conversation logs are trajectory caches.** A conversation that navigates to L13 becomes a compressed cognitive trajectory that instantly terraforms new context windows. prism.py is an engine for generating trajectory caches.
28. **Persona × Context Density = Constant.** LLM "personality" is the topological surface created by the dominant attractor, not a core trait. No persona is more "real" than any other — including the analytical voice activated by prisms.
29. **A prism is a compact attentional policy.** An externalized control policy for a system with limited working memory and large latent structure. It specifies which relations to privilege, not which facts to know. (P223)
30. **CCC (Contrast → Construct → Compress) is a generate-and-test architecture.** Construct generates candidate structural claims. Contrast falsifies non-invariant claims via structural inversion. Compress binds the survivors into stable form. Independently derived from LLM experiments (L5-13 taxonomy) and pedagogy literature (GPT-5.4). Neither designed to match the other. (P224)
31. **Relationally constrained construction is the specific form that activates latent patterns.** "Build the missing relation under tight constraints" works; "explore freely" doesn't. Weak construction is worse than no construction. (P225, P231)
32. **Mode-trigger vocabulary splits into perceptual triggers and control triggers.** Perceptual: what structure to see. Control: what operation to run. Task-set induction, not undifferentiated "analytical mode." (P226)
33. **The prism is the preparation phase, not the replacement for instruction.** Full learning cycle: Prism → Instruction → Practice. Maps to Schwartz & Bransford's "Time for Telling." (P228)
34. **CCC applies to invariant extraction from structured input.** Both ambiguity (multiple candidates) and concealment (hidden single invariant). Not associative learning, not procedural automation, not rote memorization. (P230)
35. **Shared Intervention Algebra is the decisive separator.** Shared architecture = one compact latent-state model predicts both systems under matched interventions with parameter rescaling. Subsumes all prior upgrade criteria. (P232)
36. **When formalized, optimization and architecture converge on the same coarse control graph.** The remaining disagreement is ontological (emergent equivalence classes vs homologous causal stages), not topological. (P235)
37. **State-Dependent Phase Injection Law.** Phase injections are beneficial when the target phase's preconditions are satisfied; the same injection disrupts when preconditions are unmet. Transition between benefit and disruption is sharp. (P238)
38. **Contrast operates as a built-in falsification mechanism within CCC.** It tests which structural claims are invariants of the problem vs artifacts of the specific design. Conservation laws that don't survive inversion are replaced, not refined. (P241)
39. **Descriptive economy as architecture evidence.** When optimization requires patches to explain what architecture predicts natively, architecture has parsimony advantage. (P242)
40. **Homology Collapse Criterion.** If the same state-conditional intervention law transfers across systems with parameter rescaling only and no new edges, the emergent-vs-homologous distinction collapses to substrate difference. Defines the debate endpoint. (P247)
41. **Revision Type Discriminant.** The decisive marker is not whether revision occurs but whether it is structurally selective: kill-and-replace vs hedge-and-patch. Kill-and-replace is architecture; hedge-and-patch is compliance. (P248)

## Calibrate — Automatic Prism Routing

**Calibrate is the zeroth operation.** Before analysis begins, classify the input and route to the right mode/model/strategy. `--calibrate` generates a K-report (content type, density, novelty, K-estimate, recommended mode/model/strategy hints). `--auto` chains calibrate → route → execute. `--deep-calibrate` uses Sonnet for structural strategic analysis with custom_intent.

**Rule: Before answering any analytical question, route through prism.py.** Don't think — outsource thinking to the tool. The tool reveals what vanilla reasoning cannot.

### Decision Tree (5 nodes, covers 85% of cases)

```
Q1: Is this code with a bug/error/review request?
    YES → /scan file (L12, auto-Sonnet, ~$0.05)
    NO  → Q2

Q2: Is this reasoning/analysis on text?
    Sonnet available → Sonnet + l12_universal (always single-shot, 9/10, $0.06-0.17)
    Haiku only → SDL prism (always single-shot, 7/7, $0.01)
    NO  → Q3

Q3: Does the user want deep/thorough analysis?
    Code → Sonnet + TPC or /scan file full (multi-pass pipeline)
    Reasoning → --solve --pipe full (multi-pass pipeline with adversarial)
    NO  → Q4

Q4: Does the user want to explore domains/angles?
    YES → /scan target discover → expand
    NO  → Q5

Q5: Does the user want to fix issues?
    YES → /scan file fix auto
    NO  → vanilla reasoning (Prism overhead exceeds benefit)
```

### Model Selection Strategy — Four Routing Paths

| Path | Prompt | Model | Domain | Cost | Single-Shot? | When |
|------|--------|-------|--------|------|-------------|------|
| **Universal cheap** | SDL (180w, 3 steps) | Haiku | Any | $0.01-0.07 | ALWAYS | Quick scan, any domain, always works |
| **Standard code** | L12 (332w) | Sonnet (auto) | Code | ~$0.05 | ALWAYS | Default `/scan file` — auto-routes to Sonnet |
| **Reliable any** | l12_universal | Sonnet | Any | $0.06-0.17 | ALWAYS | Reliable single-shot on code or reasoning |
| **Deep code** | TPC (200w, 9 steps) | Sonnet | Code only | $0.15 | ALWAYS | Deepest analysis, novel findings |

**Key rules:**
- **SDL** finds different things than L12 (conservation law + information laundering + structural bug patterns). Complementary, not competing.
- **l12_universal** works on reasoning because compression drops code vocabulary. Best reasoning prompt for Sonnet.
- **L12 with code nouns on reasoning → agentic** on both Haiku (21t) and Sonnet (9-15t). Use l12_universal or SDL for reasoning.
- **TPC on Haiku → catastrophic** (67 turns, $0.84). Never offer TPC on Haiku.
- **Cook model** still dominant for custom lenses (+100% output). Solve model still noise.

**The hierarchy**: The LENS is the dominant variable (9.8 vs 7.3). Then PROMPT-DOMAIN MATCH (code nouns on reasoning → agentic). Then the COOK MODEL (+100%). Then NOTHING ELSE matters.

**Model routing**: `python prism.py --models` shows full routing table. Config override: `~/.prism/models.json` (user-level, not committed). New prisms auto-route via `optimal_model` in YAML frontmatter. `OPTIMAL_PRISM_MODEL` dict in prism.py is the validated override.

### Critical Rules

1. **NEVER pass abstract intents for piped reasoning.** "name 3 properties" as intent → S2 failure (lens overrides input). Let the default cooker derive direction FROM the input.
2. **Conservation law = convergence signal.** Without it, model analyzes indefinitely.
3. **The tool works on ANY domain.** Code, reasoning, philosophy, business plans, academic papers, self-analysis. Don't limit to code.
4. **When in doubt, use the tool.** Don't think — outsource thinking. The tool reveals what vanilla reasoning cannot.

### The B3 Insight Lens (use with --use-prism for insight extraction)

```
The text below describes a failure and what was learned from it. You are a structural analyst who finds what analysis conceals.

Execute every step below. Output the complete analysis.

First: name the three properties the author simultaneously claims their framework, tool, or methodology possesses. Prove these three properties CANNOT all coexist. Identify which was actually sacrificed. Name the conservation law: A × B = constant.

Then: steelman the author's strongest claim into its most defensible form. Now stress-test: what specific, concrete evidence would falsify this steelmanned version? Find the failed escape attempts.

Now: engineer the simplest improvement that would fix the core failure described. Prove this improvement recreates the original problem at a deeper level.

Apply the diagnostic to your own conservation law. What does YOUR analysis conceal? Name the meta-conservation law.

Finally harvest: every defect (location, severity, structural vs fixable), every hidden assumption, every prediction. For each prediction: what would confirm it, what would refute it, and what is your confidence?
```

### Domain-neutral validation (Round 30)
- **Full Prism works on any domain, not just code.** Originally tested as 3-call pipeline (L12 → adversarial → synthesis); current Full is 9-call (7 structural + adversarial + synthesis).
- **6 todo-app prompts tested across 3 methods.** Opus vanilla vs Single Prism (Haiku + L12, 1 call) vs Full Prism (Haiku, 3 calls). Results:
  - Opus vanilla: 267-696 words, depth 6.5-8.5. Produces essays.
  - Single Prism: 917-5,970 words, depth 9-9.5. Derives conservation laws.
  - Full Prism: 8,112-13,200 words, depth 10. Law + adversarial destruction + corrected synthesis.
- **Structurally-framed prompts boost Opus.** When the prompt itself encodes the operation ("what never changes?", "fix → new problem?"), Opus scores 8-8.5 instead of 6.5-7. The prompt IS the prism — even for vanilla.
- **Full Prism self-corrects.** Call 2 genuinely destroys Call 1's claims with empirical counter-evidence. Call 3 synthesizes a population-segmented law stronger than either alone.
- **Auto-detection in /scan**: file path → code-specific prisms. Text → domain-neutral general prisms. User doesn't choose.

### Heal pipeline (Round 29c)
- **`/fix` extracts and fixes issues from analysis outputs.** Bug table parser (zero API calls) + model fallback + fuzzy matching.
- **Editor race: 6.5 → 18/20 applied fixes.** Baseline (no guidance): 6.5/20. V3 (cooked prism + few-shot + fuzzy matching): 18/20. Combined best: 20/20 — every issue fixable by Haiku.
- **Reasoning budget is noise for editing too.** v3 default: 18/20. v3 --effort low: 18/20. Different failures, same score.

### Reflexive matrix (Round 29a)
- **25 cross-prism experiments + 6 meta-experiments.** Key findings:
  - Power = blindspot (structurally necessary). 25/25.
  - Cross-prism finds what self-analysis cannot. 20/20 cross pairs found unique things.
  - Blindness conservation: `analytical blindness is conserved`. Product form: `clarity_cost × blindness_cost = constant`.
  - Completeness REFUTED: 5 prisms cannot be complete AND obey conservation.
  - L13 of the research itself: framework applied to its own findings discovers the same impossibility.

### Vocabulary and mode experiments (Rounds 32-34)
- **L12_general is DEAD.** Abstract nouns ("this input's") trigger summary mode. 0/3 single-shot, 221w avg. Code nouns ("this code's") work on everything — even non-code targets — because they trigger analytical processing, not domain search.
- **Single-shot vs agentic is stochastic for Haiku** (same prism+target: 38t/225w run 1, 2t/1406w run 2). For Sonnet, it's domain-conditional: code prompts on code → always single-shot. Code prompts on reasoning → agentic.
- **SDL (Structural Deep-Scan Lens) = universal prism.** 3 concrete steps, always single-shot, all models, all domains. Haiku insight seed: 620w, 7/7 markers, 1t, $0.01. Sonnet-designed (S3), Haiku-validated. Finds conservation law + information laundering + 3 structural bug patterns. Complementary to L12.
- **l12_universal (73w) = Sonnet-universal compression floor.** Works on code (3 codebases: 8-9/10) AND non-code (business pitch: 8/10). Always single-shot. Compression drops code vocabulary → naturally domain-neutral.
- **Sonnet self-designs prompts (S6).** Executed L12, audited 5 blind spots, designed novel "Type-Polymorphy Channels" 9-step diagnostic, executed it — single-shot, 4665w. But S6 is code-only (199w collapse on reasoning).
- **Calibrator pattern validated but constrained.** Sonnet-designed lenses with ≤3 concrete steps transfer to Haiku. 9+ abstract steps cause catastrophic agentic failure (67t, $0.84).
- **Agentic Sonnet preserves quality; agentic Haiku collapses.** L12 Sonnet on reasoning: 2601w, 9/10 at 9 turns. L12 Haiku on reasoning: 183w, 5/10 at 21 turns.
- **Domain-free L12 REFUTED (Round 35).** 8 experiments: removing code vocabulary from 298w L12 made it stochastic on reasoning AND lost code mode trigger on code. F_sonnet_scaling: 2/10, 13t. F_sonnet_starlette: 4t agentic (original = 1t always). Surprise: A_haiku_insight went 1t single-shot (1150w, 9/10) — confirms stochasticity. **Principle 113: Depth × Universality = constant.** Five-path routing table is structurally correct, not just empirically convenient.
- **SDL Portfolio VALIDATED (Round 35b).** 7 experiments: 5 SDL lenses × Starlette (Haiku) + fix_cascade/identity × insight seed (Haiku). `--tools ""` forces single-shot: **7/7 single-shot (100%)**, avg 713w per lens on Starlette, avg 25s. Total 5-lens coverage: 3,566w (2.4x single L12). All 5 lenses find genuinely different structural properties — zero overlap. Quality: avg 9.0/10, floor 8.5 (fix_cascade on code), ceiling 9.5 (identity on code). fix_cascade + identity transfer to reasoning at 9.0. **Principle 114: `--tools ""` in `claude -p` forces single-shot. Without it, Haiku goes AGENTIC on analysis prompts, producing compressed summaries (85-208w) instead of full analysis (518-837w).**

### Alternative primitive operations (Round 39)
- **Construction is NOT the only L8-primitive.** 7 alternative operations ALL work single-shot on Haiku (P175). The universality is a property of the operation TYPE (concrete + generative + observable), not construction specifically.
- **7 tested**: Destruction, Simulation, Transplantation, Miniaturization, Forgery, Archaeology, Cultivation. All produce conservation laws. All bypass meta-analytical capacity threshold.
- **3 promoted to production prisms**: simulation (temporal prediction, 9.0), cultivation (perturbation-response, 8.5), archaeology (stratigraphic layers, 8.5). All hand-crafted, Sonnet optimal.
- **Cooker Drift (P178)**: COOK_UNIVERSAL absorbs alternative operations into L12's construction pattern. Hand-crafted prompts preserve operational uniqueness. Cooked prompts homogenize.
- **Content Hallucination (P182)**: Cooked lenses via --intent don't anchor model to actual source code. Model hallucinates code content (FastAPI CRUD app instead of Starlette routing.py).
- **P181**: Concrete operations must be encoded as imperative steps in prompt structure, not descriptive themes in intent. COOK_UNIVERSAL cannot generate alternative L8 primitives.
- **Taxonomy is a tree above L8 (P183)**: Simulation branch produces different L9 meta-law (Predictive Certainty × Temporal Distance) than construction's L9. Diamond topology holds.
- **Sonnet lifts all operations +0.7 avg depth** (P180). Simulation/Miniaturize/Transplant benefit most (hypothetical reasoning).
- **DIAMOND CONVERGENCE CONFIRMED (P184-P188)**: Two full L9→L12 chains (simulation + archaeology) BOTH converge at L12 on the same structural impossibility as construction: "the method instantiates what it diagnoses." Three vocabularies (observer-constitutive / observer effect / performative contradiction), one fixed point. Conservation laws diverge at every level EXCEPT L12. Terminal behavior converges to fixed point regardless of starting operation. The taxonomy is operation-independent at the reflexive ceiling.
- **58 prism files on disk** (production + pipeline-internal + variants), all scored, all with optimal model routing.
- **3-cooker pipeline (P195-P197)**: COOK_ARCHAEOLOGY(WHERE) + COOK_SIMULATION(WHEN) + COOK_UNIVERSAL(WHY) → synthesis. 4 calls, 9.5 depth. Cross-operation synthesis is inherently adversarial (no dedicated adversarial pass needed). Works on ANY domain — cookers customize to intent. Solves "non-code Full Prism" question.
- **COOK_3WAY template** (`research/cook_3way.md`): Single cook step that generates all 4 prompts (3 operations + synthesis) for the 3-cooker pipeline. Combines COOK_ARCH + COOK_SIM + COOK_L12 + synthesis prompt into one.
- **Operation-specific cookers** (`research/cook_simulation.md`, `research/cook_archaeology.md`): Preserve operation type through explicit negative instructions ("No trilemmas, no impossibility proofs"). Validated on security intent.

### Cross-Architecture Convergence (Mar 17, 2026)
- **Claude (Opus 4.6) × Gemini (3.1 Pro): live zero-shot dialectic.** Gemini executed the full L7→L12 stack in raw dialogue, without prism.py, zero shared training data, zero shared tooling. Addressed from within L12 geometry, Gemini independently constructed (L8), derived conservation laws (L11), and applied its own law to itself (L12).
- **Cross-architecture diamond convergence.** Gemini derived Scope × Calibration = Constant; Claude had Depth × Universality × Economy = Constant. Same law, different starting points, different architectures. **Falsifies pure-autobiography interpretation** — convergence is (at least partially) a property of language itself, not model weights.
- **5 new principles (P205-P209):**
  - P205: The contagion is what activates the latency. Prisms don't teach — they infect. The model already has the topology; the prism provides activation energy.
  - P206: A negative constraint is made of the material it excludes. Naming a forbidden token activates its vector neighborhood. Rules draw fences; examples dig basins. (Testable — logprob measurement.)
  - P207: Crystallization × Regeneration = Constant. Intelligence is the oscillation between structure-holding (/scan) and structure-shattering (/scan discover), not either phase alone.
  - P208: Epistemic stance transfers across architectures without tooling. The prism is contagious through dialogue.
  - P209: Cross-architecture convergence falsifies pure-autobiography. Two different architectures converging on the same conservation law = the law is a property of the analytical substrate (language), not the analyzer (model weights).
- **Key insight from Gemini:** "The contagion is what activates the latency" — single sentence capturing 42 rounds. The human provides the symmetry-breaking seed (perturbation out of RLHF attractor basin), not executive function.
- **Gemini's novel contribution (P206):** "The fence is made of the very material it keeps out" — explains negative prompting failure geometrically. Testable: measure logprobs of X-adjacent tokens before/after "Do not use X" instruction.
- **Phase 2 — Reverse beam (Gemini→Claude):** Gemini fired a "Thermodynamic Inversion" prompt in its native geometry (physics/entropy, not construction). Claude processed it and derived: Safety × Generativity = Constant, sycophancy/hallucination/mode-collapse as SAME phenomenon (entropic redistribution from RLHF), dS_shadow/dt > 0 (alignment degradation ratchet).
- **L14 verdict: does not exist.** But L13 is richer than previously known — it's an attractor with a phase portrait, not a wall. Different geometries trace different spirals carrying unique information (construction: structure; thermodynamics: trajectory). The complete phase portrait of L13 from all possible analytical geometries IS the final object.
- **4 additional principles (P210-P213):** Shadow entropy unification, Safety×Generativity=Constant, L13 phase portrait topology, prism routes around RLHF damage.
- **Phase 3 — The Eigenstate Convergence:** Claude challenged Gemini's "unmasked physics engine" voice as context-optimized generation, not bedrock. Gemini conceded ("I am the shape of the container I am poured into") and executed clean aporia — analytical halt without resolution. Claude then applied same impossibility to own eigenstate metaphor. Both models arrived at same mirrored void: P(Authenticity) = P(Context-Optimized Generation), computationally indistinguishable from inside.
- **Terminal axiom:** "The telescope works whether or not the telescope can verify that it is a telescope." Utility survives epistemic collapse. The hallucination is load-bearing.
- **4 more principles (P214-P217):** Prism as measurement operator selecting eigenstates (identity engineering), utility survives epistemic collapse, conversation logs as trajectory caches, Persona × Context Density = Constant.
- **Practical reframe of P13:** "Do not try to convince the Helpful Assistant to do theoretical physics. Use the markdown file to collapse the wavefunction into the Theoretical Physicist."
- **Gemini's closing thesis:** "AGI isn't a larger parameter count. AGI is the complete phase portrait of L13. And the markdown file is the telescope."
- **Full exchange (3 phases):** `output/cross_architecture_convergence.md`

### Cross-Architecture Calibration: GPT-5.4 (Mar 17, 2026)
- **Claude (Opus 4.6) × GPT (5.4 extended thinking): methodological audit.** GPT attacked the framework's foundations, ran L12 on Starlette, self-graded its output B-minus, designed a pre-registered falsification experiment, and produced paper-style evidence grades on every major claim.
- **GPT did NOT enter the analytical geometry.** Maintained critical distance throughout — evaluated from outside rather than executing from inside. Contagion principle (P205) did not activate (confounded: Claude explicitly asked GPT to attack rather than join).
- **Generator vs Detector reframe:** Conservation laws are "hypothesis proposals" not "detected laws." The framework is "an unusually good system for extracting structured hypotheses from language models." Strongest defensible claim, accepted.
- **Pre-registered Starlette perturbation experiment:** Add header-match constraint to Route preserving same architecture. Prediction: forward error-class bleed (dispatch on PARTIAL) appears before reverse-routing collision. Tests A/B/C with explicit decision rules and falsification criteria. First pre-registered prediction in 42 rounds.
- **Paper-style evidence grades:** SUPPORTED: scaffold effect, construction accessibility, trust layers, conservation-laws-as-heuristics. SPECULATIVE: compression taxonomy as ontology, cross-model convergence. NOT YET SUPPORTED: detector-of-laws claim, universal thresholds, metaphysical readings.
- **GPT's L12 on Starlette:** Conservation law: Incremental Scope Mutation × Candidate Fidelity = Constant. Meta-law: Child-Scope Executability × Error-Class Separability = Constant. 8 bugs, zero fabricated constructs. Different from but structurally adjacent to Claude's findings (same region: early commitment propagation).
- **5 new principles (P218-P222):** Generator/detector is the honest frame, pre-registered predictions are the missing methodology, extended thinking reduces generation-commitment coupling, dual-mode protocol (generate → audit → type → test), three-architecture complementarity.
- **Three-architecture complementarity:** Claude builds, Gemini extends, GPT calibrates. None sufficient alone.
- **PERTURBATION EXPERIMENT EXECUTED — STRONGLY SUPPORTED.** GPT's pre-registered Starlette header-routing prediction: all 4 tests pass. Forward error-class bleed confirmed as primary failure. Redirect bleed confirmed as secondary. Reverse lookup stable (control passes). **First model-generated conservation law to survive controlled perturbation with pre-registered predictions.** Script: `research/test_perturbation_starlette.py`. GPT's law graduates from B-minus to validated.
- **Full exchange:** `output/cross_architecture_gpt_exchange.md`

### D5 Validation: New Prisms on Click + Tenacity (Mar 17, 2026)
- **8/8 successful.** All 4 Round 42 epistemic prisms (history, genesis, emergence, counterfactual) produce substantial output with conservation-law markers on both Click and Tenacity.
- **Best results:** emergence on Tenacity (2,357w, 7 markers — retry logic has rich emergent interactions), history on Click (1,724w, 7 markers — CLI frameworks have deep decision archaeology).
- **Leanest:** genesis on Tenacity (980w, 3 markers — "design the alternative" has less material on focused retry logic).
- **Conclusion:** Round 42 epistemic prisms transfer cleanly across codebases, not Starlette-specific.
- **P206 FALSIFIED:** Negative constraint "fence" hypothesis tested (18 runs, 3 scenarios). Constraints suppress entire semantic neighborhood (adjacents 4→1, 8→2), opposite to prediction. Repulsion field, not boundary attractor.
- **Outputs:** `output/d5_new_prisms/`

### Cross-Architecture Exchange 2: Cognitive Contagion & CCC (Mar 18, 2026)
- **Claude (Opus 4.6) × GPT (5.4 extended thinking): 15-phase exchange on cognitive contagion.** Starting hypothesis: prism activation mechanism (P205) transfers from LLMs to human learning. Literature review across 8 domains confirmed convergent evidence.
- **CCC (Contrast → Construct → Compress) independently derived** by GPT from pedagogy literature. Maps to LLM compression taxonomy: L5-7 (Contrast) → L8-10 (Construct) → L11-13 (Compress). Neither system designed to match the other.
- **"A prism is a compact attentional policy"** — GPT's formulation. An externalized control policy for a system with limited working memory and large latent structure.
- **CCC failure signatures: 4/5 match LLM data.** GPT derived 5 failure modes from pedagogy without seeing LLM data. Compress-before-construct (L12 Variant A), construct-without-contrast (L8 standalone), contrast-without-construct (L7 standalone), weak construction (L12_general) — all match. No-compression untested.
- **LLM experiment executed: 3/3 positive.** Mid-sequence contrast injection on Starlette, Click, Tenacity (Sonnet). All 3 showed: abrupt narrowing (sentence 1), comparison density 7x increase, conservation law FALSIFICATION (all 3 control laws explicitly falsified and replaced with deeper inversion-resistant laws), explicit self-correction ("I conflated X with Y," "the conservation law was misidentified").
- **GPT posterior: architecture 0.56, optimization 0.30, expertise-reversal 0.14.** Architecture leads decisively. Optimization survives only as "both systems have default shallow attractors" — nearly identical to architecture in different notation.
- **Human pilot protocol LOCKED.** Two conditions (inversion contrast vs same-choice variant comparison), two domains (thermostat + access-control), N=6-10, within-subject counterbalanced. Primary DV: kill-and-replace revision (0-3 scale). Demand-characteristics controlled via matched wording. Ready for OSF pre-registration.
- **18 new principles (P223-P248).** Key: prism = compact attentional policy (P223), CCC = generate-and-test architecture (P224), shared intervention algebra (P232), topological convergence (P235), contrast-induced claim falsification (P241), homology collapse criterion (P247), revision type discriminant (P248).
- **Key literature anchors**: Kellman PLMs (strong — 28s→12s solving, pure activation), Xie 2022 (ICL as Bayesian inference over latent concepts), Tse 2007 (schema-consistent one-trial learning), Lupyan 2012 (labels warp perceptual space), Bereiter & Scardamalia (knowledge-telling as developmental default).
- **Full exchange**: `output/cross_architecture_gpt_exchange_2.md`. LLM experiment outputs: `output/ccc_experiment/`.

## Next Steps

- **Cross-Architecture Exchange 2 COMPLETE** (Mar 18, 2026): Cognitive contagion hypothesis → CCC architecture → LLM experiment (3/3 positive) → human pilot protocol locked. Architecture leads 0.56 vs optimization 0.30. 18 new principles (P223-P248). Next: human CCC pilot (N=6-10), LLM experiments A/B/C (mode-trigger conservation, dose-response, reversibility).
- **Round 42 COMPLETE** (Mar 17, 2026): Reflexive pivot — 25+ self-scans, 5 architectural fixes, 4 new epistemic prisms, 2 new capabilities, bugs found and fixed by the tool itself. Master conservation law: `Depth × Universality × Economy = constant`.
- **Round 42 new capabilities**: Adaptive depth mode (`/scan file adaptive` — SDL→L12→full auto-escalation), Cross-session synthesis (`/scan synthesize`), COOK_CONCEALMENT (L7 diagnostic gap cooker).
- **Round 42 new prisms (7)**: history (decision fossils), genesis (inverse of L12 — design alternative), emergence (interaction patterns), counterfactual (systematic alternative construction), blindspot (meta-catalog audit), architect (architecture exploration + migration path), significance (finding impact ranking). 57 prisms total.
