# LongReadAlignmentAssembler – AI contributor guide

This repo implements LRAA: isoform discovery and/or quantification from long-read RNA-seq. Use these notes to navigate architecture, workflows, and project-specific patterns quickly.

## Big picture and data flow
- Top-level entrypoint is `LRAA` (Python script, not a package). It orchestrates the run per contig and strand, and writes outputs (`LRAA.gtf`, `LRAA.quant.expr`, `LRAA.quant.tracking`, optional `LRAA.bed`, and prelim debug files prefixed by `__`).
- Core pipeline:
  1) Build splice graph from BAM alignments and genome: `pylib/Splice_graph.py` (see `Splice_graph.build_splice_graph_for_contig`). TSS/PolyA sites may be inferred; exon/intron nodes are constructed using `networkx` + `intervaltree`.
  2) Build MultiPath counts from read alignments, then a MultiPath graph: `pylib/LRAA.py` (class) → `pylib/MultiPathGraph.py`. Nodes represent read-supported simple paths over splice-graph nodes; boundaries use TSS/PolyA where present.
  3) Reconstruct isoforms via trellis search and iterative best-path selection (`pylib/LRAA.py:LRAA.reconstruct_isoforms`, `_reconstruct_isoforms_single_component`) into `Transcript` objects.
  4) Quantify isoforms with EM: `pylib/Quantify.py` assigns reads to transcripts and runs EM (configurable) to produce per-isoform counts/TPM and optional BAM tagging.

## Modes, CLI, and outputs
- CLI lives in `LRAA` (main). Key modes:
  - Discovery + quantification (default): requires `--bam` and `--genome`; optional `--gtf` to guide assembly.
  - Quantification-only: `--quant_only --gtf <targets.gtf>`; writes `*.quant.expr` and `*.quant.tracking`; optional `--tag_bam` annotates reads in the BAM.
  - Restrict by contig/region: `--contig chr2` and/or `--region chr2:12345-56789` (append `+`/`-` to fix strand).
  - Filtering switches: `--ME_only`, `--SE_only`, `--no_filter_isoforms`, `--no_norm` or `--normalize_max_cov_level N`.
  - Performance: `--CPU N` controls multiprocessing; components spawn when size ≥ `config['min_mpgn_component_size_for_spawn']`.
- Outputs per run: `LRAA.gtf` (+ `.bed`), `LRAA.quant.expr`, `LRAA.quant.tracking`; many debug artifacts when `--debug` or `LRAA_Globals.DEBUG` (files/dirs prefixed with `__`).

## Configuration conventions
- Global config is centralized in `pylib/LRAA_Globals.py` (`config` dict). The CLI updates many entries directly; see the section “update config” in `LRAA`.
- For ad-hoc overrides, `--config_update my.json` applies key:value pairs post-CLI parsing. The main script gently casts types to match existing defaults. When adding new config keys, define a default in `LRAA_Globals.config` and (optionally) surface a CLI flag.
- Splice-graph parameters are set via `Splice_graph.init_sg_params(...)` in `LRAA`; update there if adding new SG-level thresholds.

## Core modules and how they interact
- `pylib/Splice_graph.py`: Builds and holds the splice digraph; provides interval queries (exon/intron), node accessors, and component partitioning. Class variables hold tunables (set by `init_sg_params`).
- `pylib/LRAA.py` (class): Bridges splice graph → multipath graph, reconstructs isoforms, manages multiprocessing and scoring. Writes debug GTFs and component dumps when debugging.
- `pylib/MultiPathGraph.py`: Converts read-supported multipaths into a DAG of `MultiPathGraphNode` with boundary flags (TSS/PolyA). Prunes large components using `config['max_path_nodes_per_component']`.
- `pylib/Quantify.py`: Assigns reads to transcripts (exact/compatible tests) and runs EM. See `_assign_path_to_transcript` and `_estimate_isoform_read_support` for assignment logic.
- `pylib/Transcript.py`: Transcript feature container with simple-path representation, TSS/PolyA helpers, and quant fields.

## Project-specific patterns and gotchas
- Boundary nodes: TSS/PolyA affect sorting and compatibility checks; see `Transcript.get_left/right_boundary_sort_weight` and checks in `MultiPathGraph` and `Quantify`.
- Multiprocessing: Only components above a threshold spawn; jobs communicate via `MultiProcessManager.Queue`. Ensure objects passed between processes are picklable.
- Debug mode: Set via `--debug` or `LRAA_Globals.DEBUG`; expect numerous `__*` files (e.g., `__mpgns.*.gtf`, `__MPGN_components_described.*.bed`). Avoid committing these.
- BAM index: `LRAA` auto-builds a `.bai` with `samtools index` if missing. The normalization step uses `util/normalize_bam_by_strand.py` when enabled.
- Read assignment: Default requires substantial overlap (`config['fraction_read_align_overlap']`) and may weight assignments (`config['weight_reads_by_3prime_agreement']`, based on 3' end agreement). EM regularization is `config['EM_alpha']`.

## Dependencies and external tools
- Python libs: `pysam`, `networkx`, `intervaltree`, `tqdm`, plus scientific stack for utilities/tests. See `Docker/Dockerfile` for an authoritative list.
- External tools used in workflows/tests: `samtools` (indexing), `gffcompare` (evaluation in `testing/sirvs`), and `miniwdl` for WDL-based smoke tests.
- Utilities live in `util/` (Perl and Python helpers for BAM/GTF transformations) and are invoked by the main script.

## Development environment setup
For local development and testing, set up a Python virtual environment with required dependencies:

```bash
# Create and activate virtual environment (from repo root)
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
# .venv\Scripts\activate   # On Windows

# Install core Python dependencies
pip install pysam networkx intervaltree tqdm

# For testing/development, you may also need:
# pip install pytest miniwdl
```

**Important notes:**
- Python 3.10+ recommended (tested with 3.13)
- On macOS with Homebrew Python, use the full path if needed: `/opt/homebrew/bin/python3 -m venv .venv`
- If `pysam` installation fails, ensure you have build tools (Xcode on macOS, build-essential on Linux)
- The `.venv` directory is git-ignored; recreate it as needed
- Always activate the venv before running `LRAA` or utility scripts directly (e.g., `../../util/correct_bam_alignments.py`)
- For containerized environments, use `Docker/Dockerfile` which contains the complete dependency list

## Testing and examples
- End-to-end examples: `testing/Makefile` runs scenarios in subfolders (SIRVs, quant-only, etc.). The `testing/sirvs/Makefile` shows canonical invocations of `../../LRAA` and expected outputs.
- Unit tests: Pytest tests live under `pylib/` (e.g., `test_sqanti_like_annotator.py`, `test_diff_iso_tests.py`). Keep new tests colocated in `pylib/` and prefer small, deterministic fixtures.

## When adding features
- New CLI options: add to `LRAA`, update `LRAA_Globals.config` default, and ensure the option propagates into the module that consumes it (e.g., splice graph params via `init_sg_params`).
- Isoform scoring/selection: changes usually live in `pylib/LRAA.py` (trellis build/score thresholds) and must remain consistent with `Quantify` assignment logic.
- Splice-graph heuristics: prefer class-level tunables in `Splice_graph` and make them controllable via config.
- Maintain logging style (`logging` module) and avoid broad refactors; many types are shared across modules.

## WDL workflow development guidelines
When modifying or creating WDL files in `WDL/` or `WDL/subwdls/`:
- **ALWAYS run `miniwdl check <file.wdl>`** after making changes to validate syntax and catch errors early.
- **WDL does NOT support `None` as a value**. Do not use `None` in conditionals or assignments (e.g., `else None` is invalid).
- **Optional outputs (`File?`) don't require existence checks**: If a file path is declared as optional (`File?`) in the output section, it's valid for the file not to exist. The WDL runtime handles this gracefully without needing conditional logic.
- **Avoid glob() for simple optional outputs**: For straightforward optional file outputs, use `File?` directly rather than arrays with glob patterns.
- **Common WDL patterns**:
  - Use `select_first([optional_var])` to unwrap optional values when you know they're defined.
  - Use `if defined(var) then select_first([var]) else default_value` for optional inputs with defaults.
  - Use `~{if defined(optional_param) then "--flag " + optional_param else ""}` for conditional CLI arguments in bash commands.
- **Testing WDL workflows**: The `WDL/` directory contains the main workflows; `miniwdl` is available for validation and local testing. Check existing workflows for examples of proper optional handling and conditional execution.

If anything above is unclear or you need deeper examples (e.g., trellis details, EM tuning, or testing specific scenarios), ask and we'll refine this guide.
