## Plugin Architecture

```
.claude-plugin/
  marketplace.json     # Marketplace registry with plugin listings

<plugin-name>/
  .claude-plugin/
    plugin.json        # Plugin metadata (name, version, description)
  commands/            # Slash commands (*.md files)
  agents/              # Specialized agent definitions (*.md files)
  skills/              # Reusable skill documents (SKILL.md in subdirs)
  scripts/             # Shell scripts for automation
```

### Key Patterns

- **Commands**: Markdown files with YAML frontmatter (`allowed-tools`, `argument-hint`, `description`)
- **Agents**: Markdown files with YAML frontmatter defining specialized agents with specific tools and skills
- **Skills**: Best practices documents activated by agents, providing domain knowledge
- **Shell output embedding**: Commands can embed shell output using `!` backticks (e.g., `!`git branch --show-current``)
- **Arguments**: Commands accept arguments via `$1`, `$ARGUMENTS`

### Discoverability Fields

Commands and skills support optional fields for improved discoverability:

| Field | Type | Format | Purpose |
|-------|------|--------|---------|
| `keywords` | `string[]` | kebab-case lowercase | Search/taxonomy terms (e.g., `pull-request`, `code-review`) |
| `triggers` | `string[]` | Natural language | User intent phrases (e.g., `"review this PR"`, `"check my code"`) |
| `code-triggers` | `string[]` | Code identifiers | Patterns that activate skills (e.g., `BaseModel`, `Field`) |

**Example command frontmatter:**
```yaml
---
description: Comprehensive code review for a pull request
keywords:
  - pull-request
  - code-review
  - github-pr
triggers:
  - "review this PR"
  - "review pull request"
allowed-tools: [...]
---
```

**Example skill frontmatter with code-triggers:**
```yaml
---
name: pydantic
description: Data validation with Pydantic v2.
keywords:
  - pydantic-v2
  - data-validation
triggers:
  - "create data model"
  - "validate input"
code-triggers:
  - "BaseModel"
  - "Field"
  - "field_validator"
---
```

<critical_rules>

<rule id="version-bump" priority="blocking" authority="repository-standard">

## Version Management

When modifying any plugin, YOU MUST complete these steps IN ORDER:

1. **Bump the version** in the plugin's `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` file
2. **Use semantic versioning**: patch (0.0.x) for fixes, minor (0.x.0) for features, major (x.0.0) for breaking changes
3. **Update the CHANGELOG.md** in the plugin's root directory with the changes made

NEVER skip version bumping. This is a MANDATORY step that prevents version conflicts and maintains marketplace integrity. No exceptions.

</rule>

<rule id="ai-review-verification" priority="critical">

## AI Code Review Principle

AI feedback is NOT valid by default. YOU MUST verify every comment from AI reviewers against actual code before acting on it. This applies to all code review workflows.

</rule>

<rule id="prd-observable-behavior" priority="recommended">

## PRD Documentation Standard

PRDs focus on **observable behavior**, not implementation details. Describe what users can do, not how it's implemented.

</rule>

</critical_rules>
