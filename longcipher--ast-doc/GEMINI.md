# Rust Workspace Agent Instructions

## Scope

- This template targets Rust workspaces only.
- `bin/` contains CLI binary crates.
- `crates/` contains reusable library crates.
- No frontend/web-framework-specific assumptions.

## Tool Usage & Commands

- **NEVER execute `cargo` commands in parallel.** Rust's cargo uses strict file locks on the `target/` directory.
- ALWAYS run `cargo check`, `cargo build`, or `cargo test` sequentially. Wait for one to finish before starting the next.
- When fixing errors, execute the file `Write`/`Edit` tool FIRST, wait for it to succeed, and only THEN run `cargo` commands to verify. Do not parallelize file edits with cargo builds.

## Cargo Workspace Rules (Critical)

1. Never manually type dependency versions in `Cargo.toml`; use `cargo add`.
2. Add workspace-level dependencies with:

   ```bash
   cargo add <crate> --workspace
   ```

3. Add sub-crate dependencies with:

   ```bash
   cargo add <crate> -p <crate-name> --workspace
   ```

4. Root `[workspace.dependencies]` must use numeric versions only.
5. Root `[workspace.dependencies]` must not carry features by default.
6. Sub-crates must use `workspace = true` for `version`, `edition`, and shared dependencies.

## Preferred Dependencies and Versions

When introducing new dependencies, prefer these versions unless compatibility requires an upgrade:

```toml
# rust
clap = "4.6.1"
config = "0.15.23"
eyre = "0.6.12"
serde = "1.0.228"
thiserror = "2.0.18"
tokio = "1.52.3"
tracing = "0.1.44"
tracing-subscriber = "0.3.23"
tracing-opentelemetry = "0.33.0"
opentelemetry = "0.32.0"
opentelemetry-otlp = "0.32.0"
sqlx = "=0.9.0-alpha.1"
utoipa = "5.5.0"
utoipa-swagger-ui = "9.0.2"
arc-swap = "1.9.1"
hpx = "2.4.13"
scc = "3.7.1"
winnow = "1.0.3"
shadow-rs = "2.0.0"
ecdysis = "1.1.1"
```

## Dependency Priority and Forbidden Choices

- HTTP client preference: `hpx` (with `rustls`) over `reqwest`.
- Concurrent map/set preference: `scc` over `dashmap` and `RwLock<HashMap<...>>`.
- Parsing preference: `winnow` or `pest` over ad-hoc manual parsing.
- Read-heavy shared state: `arc-swap` over `RwLock`.
- Forbidden by default: `anyhow`, `log`, `reqwest`, `dashmap`.

## Engineering Principles

### Rust Implementation Guidelines

1. Error handling:
   - Application layer: `eyre`.
   - Library layer: `thiserror`.
2. Database (`sqlx`):
   - Prefer runtime queries (`sqlx::query_as`).
   - DB structs should derive `sqlx::FromRow`.
   - Avoid compile-time `sqlx::query!` macros by default.
3. Concurrency:
   - Prefer lock-free/container-first approaches (`scc`, `ArcSwap`).
   - Avoid `Arc<Mutex<T>>` when better alternatives are available.
4. Observability:
   - Logging: `tracing` only.
   - Metrics/traces: OpenTelemetry OTLP gRPC.
   - Prometheus should not be the default instrumentation path.
5. API docs:
   - Generate OpenAPI with `utoipa` when exposing HTTP APIs.
6. Configuration:
   - Use the `config` crate and external configuration files (prefer TOML).
7. Binaries:
   - Use `ecdysis` for graceful restart/reload flows in daemon/server binaries.
8. Safety:
   - Use `unsafe` only when strictly necessary and document the safety invariants.

### Key Design Principles

- Modularity: Design each crate so it can be used as a standalone library with clear boundaries and minimal hidden coupling.
- Performance: Prefer architectures that support parallelism, memory-mapped I/O for large read-heavy workloads, optimized data structures, and lock-free data types.
- Extensibility: Use traits and generic types to support multiple implementations without invasive refactors.
- Type Safety: Maintain strong static typing across interfaces and internals, with minimal use of dynamic dispatch.

### Performance Considerations

- Avoid allocations in hot paths; prefer references and borrowing to reduce allocation and copy overhead.
- Use `rayon` for CPU-bound parallel processing.
- Use `tokio` async/await for I/O-bound concurrency.

### Concurrency and Async Execution

- Prefer atomic types (`AtomicUsize`, `AtomicBool`, etc.) with explicit `Ordering` for simple shared state.
- Use `scc` for highly concurrent maps/sets; avoid `Arc<RwLock<HashMap<...>>>` and `Arc<Mutex<HashMap<...>>>` on hot paths.
- Use `moka` for concurrent caches instead of custom LRU implementations.
- Prefer `parking_lot::{Mutex, RwLock}` over `std::sync` locks for synchronous locking.
- Release `std::sync::Mutex` and `parking_lot::Mutex` guards before hitting any `.await` point.
- Use `tokio::sync::Mutex` for locks that span across `.await` points.
- Use `tokio::task::spawn_blocking` for CPU-bound work and blocking I/O.
- Batch work or use bounded worker patterns instead of spawning massive volumes of tiny Tokio tasks.
- Channel selection:
  - Async-to-Async: `tokio::sync::mpsc` / `tokio::sync::broadcast`
  - Sync/MPMC: `crossbeam-channel` or `flume`
  - Avoid `std::sync::mpsc`

### Memory and Allocation

- For binary server applications, configure `tikv-jemallocator` or `mimalloc`.
- For trusted internal hash keys, prefer `ahash` or `rustc-hash` over default SipHash-based maps.
- Use `compact_str` or `smol_str` for small-string-heavy paths.
- Prefer `beef::Cow` over `std::borrow::Cow` when minimizing footprint.
- Use `bytes::Bytes` / `bytes::BytesMut` for network buffers; pass `Bytes` instead of cloning `Vec<u8>`.
- For critical serialization hot paths, prefer `rkyv` or `zerocopy`; reserve `serde_json` for config and non-critical APIs.

### Type and Layout

- Order struct fields from largest to smallest unless stronger semantic grouping is required.
- Use `#[repr(C)]` / `#[repr(packed)]` only for FFI or fixed protocol layout requirements.
- Keep error types compact on hot paths; box large error payloads when needed to reduce `Result<T, E>` size.
- Prefer typestate-style APIs for compile-time state transitions instead of runtime state checks.

### Tooling and Hot Paths

- Keep code clean under `clippy::pedantic`, `clippy::nursery`, and `clippy::cargo` (allow `missing_errors_doc` for non-public APIs when needed).
- Use `#[inline]` for tiny methods called in hot loops or on every request, especially across crate boundaries.
- Mark cold error paths with `#[cold]` and `#[inline(never)]` when it improves hot-path instruction locality.

### Common Pitfalls

- Keep async tasks non-blocking; offload CPU-bound work to `spawn_blocking` or `rayon`.
- Handle errors explicitly and consistently with the `?` operator and concrete error types.

### What to Avoid

- Incomplete implementations: finish features before submitting.
- Large, sweeping changes: keep changes focused and reviewable.
- Mixing unrelated changes: keep one logical change per commit.

## Foundry Rules (If Solidity Exists)

- Use `soldeer` for dependencies; do not use git submodules.
- Required commands:
  - `forge soldeer install`
  - `forge soldeer update`
  - `forge build`
  - `forge test`

## Development Workflow

When fixing failures, identify root cause first, then apply idiomatic fixes instead of suppressing warnings or patching symptoms.

Use outside-in development for behavior changes:

- **Git Restrictions:** NEVER use `git worktree`. All code modifications MUST be made directly on the current branch in the existing working directory.
- drive implementation with failing crate-local unit tests and `proptest` properties in the affected crate,
- keep `proptest` in the normal `cargo test` loop instead of creating a separate property-test command,
- treat `cargo-fuzz` as conditional planning work rather than baseline template setup,

After each feature or bug fix, run:

```bash
just format
just lint
just test
just test-all
```

If any command fails, report the failure and do not claim completion.

## Testing Requirements

- Unit tests: colocate with implementation (`#[cfg(test)]`).
- Prefer example-based unit tests for named business cases and edge cases, and reserve `proptest` for invariants that should hold across many generated inputs.
- Property tests: colocate `proptest` coverage with the crate logic it exercises so it runs through the ordinary `cargo test` path.
- Benchmarks: only plan or add Criterion when the scope includes an explicit latency SLA, throughput target, or known hot path in a specific crate.
- Benchmark workflow: when benchmarking is justified, add Criterion only in the affected crate instead of pre-seeding benchmark scaffolding across the workspace.
- Fuzz tests: only plan or add `cargo-fuzz` when a crate parses hostile input, implements protocols, decodes binary formats, or contains meaningful `unsafe` code.
- Fuzz workflow: when fuzzing is justified, generate the standard layout in the affected crate with `cargo fuzz init`, then run targets with `cargo fuzz run <target>` instead of pre-seeding a `fuzz/` directory in every starter.
- For `/pb-plan` work, mark benchmarking as `conditional` or `N/A` unless the scope explicitly includes a performance requirement or hot path, and mark fuzzing as `conditional` or `N/A` unless the scope explicitly includes parser-like, protocol, binary-decoding, or `unsafe`-heavy code.
- Integration tests: place in crate-level `tests/`.
- Add tests for behavioral changes and public API changes.

## Language Requirement

- Documentation, comments, and commit messages must be English only.
