Stack Migration Status
----------------------

This project is currently in a transitional phase, migrating from an existing
Fresh + Preact stack to a new SolidStart + Solid + GraphQL + Relay stack:

 -  **Legacy Stack (web/)**: Fresh framework with Preact, JSX for templating,
    direct database queries; runs on Deno
 -  **New Stack (web-next/)**: SolidStart v2 with Solid.js, GraphQL with Relay,
    Lingui for i18n; runs on Node.js (managed via pnpm workspaces)

### Working with Both Stacks

 -  **Maintain the legacy stack** in `web/` directory for existing functionality
 -  **Develop new features** in `web-next/` directory using the new stack
 -  **Do not mix technologies** between the two directories
 -  The migration will be completed over several weeks

### When to Use Which Stack

 -  Use `web/` for:
     -  Bug fixes and maintenance of existing features
     -  Features that need immediate deployment
     -  Any work specifically requested for the legacy system

 -  Use `web-next/` for:
     -  New feature development
     -  Modern UI components and patterns (see <DESIGN.md> for the
        design system)
     -  Any new internationalization work
     -  GraphQL schema changes and Relay integration


Build/Lint/Test Commands
------------------------

Cross-stack tasks (dev, build, prod, migrate) live in `mise.toml` and are
invoked with `mise run <task>`. Run `mise tasks` to list everything that's
available. Tools (Deno, Node.js, pnpm) are pinned in the same `mise.toml`,
so `mise install` once gets you a reproducible toolchain. mise also
auto-loads `.env` so tasks pick up `DATABASE_URL` etc. without each
underlying command needing an explicit `--env-file` flag.

### Per-stack tasks (via mise)

 -  Dev server: `mise run dev:web` / `mise run dev:graphql` /
    `mise run dev:web-next`
 -  Build: `mise run build:web` / `mise run build:web-next`
 -  Production start: `mise run prod:web` / `mise run prod:graphql` /
    `mise run prod:web-next`

### Database migrations (via mise)

 -  Apply: `mise run migrate`
 -  Generate a new migration: `mise run migrate:generate`
 -  Apply against the test database: `mise run migrate:test`

### Operations (via mise)

 -  Generate an instance actor JWK (prints to stdout, paste into
    `INSTANCE_ACTOR_KEY`): `mise run keygen`
 -  Create a user account from the CLI: `mise run addaccount`

### Workspace tasks (still on `deno task`)

 -  Lint/format check: `deno task check`
 -  Run tests: `deno task test`
 -  Pre-commit hook: `deno task hooks:pre-commit`

### web-next helpers (run from `web-next/`)

 -  Relay codegen: `pnpm codegen` (Vite runs this automatically when watchman
    is installed)
 -  Extract translations: `pnpm extract`

Note: `mise run dev:web-next` requires `API_URL` set to the GraphQL endpoint
(e.g. `API_URL=http://localhost:8000/graphql` when running against the legacy
web server, or `http://localhost:8080/graphql` against the standalone GraphQL
server). web-next reads this at runtime — no rebuild needed when it changes.


Code Style Guidelines
---------------------

### General

 -  Format code with `deno fmt` before submitting PRs
 -  Use spaces for indentation (not tabs)

### Commit Messages

 -  First line should be short and concise
 -  Clearly describe the purpose of the changes
 -  When AI tools assist with a commit, include an
    `Assisted-by: AGENT_NAME:MODEL_VERSION` trailer
 -  Do not use `Co-authored-by` for AI assistants; see the
    [AI Usage Policy](AI_POLICY.md)

### Imports

 -  External imports first, internal imports second (alphabetically within
    groups)
 -  Use `type` keyword for type imports when appropriate

### Naming

 -  camelCase for variables, functions, and methods
 -  PascalCase for classes, interfaces, types, and components
 -  Files with components use PascalCase (Button.tsx)
 -  Model files use lowercase (post.ts)
 -  Tests have a `.test.ts` suffix

### TypeScript

 -  Use explicit typing for complex return types
 -  Use interfaces for component props (e.g., ButtonProps)

### Components

 -  Use functional components with props destructuring
 -  Tailwind CSS for styling
 -  Components in components/ directory
 -  Interactive components in islands/ directory (Fresh framework pattern)
 -  For visual decisions in `web-next/` (color tokens, typography, component
    patterns, brand assets), follow <DESIGN.md>

### Data Loading (web-next)

 -  For page/route-level preloaded queries, use `createStablePreloadedQuery`
    (from `~/lib/relayPreload.ts`) instead of solid-relay's
    `createPreloadedQuery` whenever the result feeds a
    `<Show keyed when={data()}>` (or any conditional that unmounts a subtree
    when the value turns falsy).
 -  Why: solid-relay can emit a transient `null`/`undefined` (when a
    query/fragment snapshot is republished inside `batch()`). If that flash
    reaches a `<Show>` while `isHydrating()` is true, the subtree remounts and
    re-enters Solid's hydration path with hydration-registry nodes that were
    already consumed; Kobalte components (rendered via `Polymorphic`/`Dynamic`)
    then crash with `TypeError: … is not a function`.
 -  How the helper behaves: it holds the last non-null value only *through
    hydration* (until `onMount`), then tracks the live store. So the subtree
    stays mounted across the hydration flash, but genuine input changes (search,
    sort, route params) are reflected immediately afterward instead of masked by
    stale data. A remount after hydration is harmless (`getNextElement()` is no
    longer on the path).
 -  Do NOT guard with `!data.pending && data()`: short-circuiting `data()`
    stops the pending resource from throwing its Promise, so the SSR
    `<Suspense>` boundary never suspends and the server streams a blank page
    (everything must then render client-side).
 -  Exceptions: keep plain `createPreloadedQuery` for:
     -  queries whose source legitimately becomes `null` (inactive) and whose
        empty state is meaningful (e.g. search keyed on the query string;
        profile pins loaded only after hydration) — the helper would hold the
        last value through the hydration window;
     -  queries read directly via `.pending` rather than gating a `<Show>`
        subtree (e.g. the root layout's signed-in account), where there is no
        remount-during-hydration risk to fix.

### Error Handling

 -  Use structured logging via LogTape
 -  Include context in error details


GraphQL Schema Documentation
----------------------------

Every element in the GraphQL schema (types, interfaces, unions, enums,
enum values, fields, arguments, and mutations) must have a `description`.
Run `deno task codegen` from the `graphql/` directory after any schema change
to regenerate `graphql/schema.graphql`.

### What to document

Write descriptions that explain **intent, usage, and gotchas**, not just
what the name already says.  A description that only restates the identifier
(e.g. “`postCount`: the count of posts”) adds no value.  Instead, cover:

 -  **Why this field/type exists** and when callers should use it vs. a
    similar alternative (e.g. `Actor.iri` vs. `Actor.url`, or `viewerFollows`
    vs. `follows(followeeId: …)`).
 -  **Visibility or auth constraints** that are not obvious from the type
    signature (e.g. “only visible to moderators”, “requires authentication”).
 -  **Behavioral edge cases**: null semantics, async population, federation
    nuances, pagination limits, or side effects on mutations.
 -  **Common mistakes**: for example, confusing `Post.uuid` (row PK) with
    the UUID embedded in `Post.url` for source-backed local posts.

### Formatting rules

 -  Write descriptions in **Markdown**.
 -  Wrap type names, field names, argument names, enum values, and `null` /
    `true` / `false` literals in backticks  (e.g. `` `Actor` ``,
    `` `Post.uuid` ``, `` `null` ``).
 -  Do not use em dashes.  Use a colon or parentheses instead.
 -  Keep descriptions concise: one to three sentences is usually enough.
    Longer explanations belong in inline code comments.

### Keeping docs in sync

When you change the **behavior** of a field, argument, or mutation, update
its description in the same commit.  Stale documentation is worse than no
documentation.

### Where descriptions live

Schema descriptions are defined in the Pothos builder calls inside
`graphql/*.ts`, not in `graphql/schema.graphql` (which is auto-generated).
Add a `description:` property to:

 -  `builder.enumType(…, { description: "…", values: { VALUE: { description: "…" } } })`
 -  `builder.drizzleNode(…, { description: "…", … })`
 -  `builder.drizzleInterface(…, { description: "…", … })`
 -  field definitions: `t.field({ description: "…", … })`,
    `t.exposeString("col", { description: "…" })`, etc.
 -  `t.arg(…, { description: "…" })` for arguments


Internationalization (i18n)
---------------------------

### Legacy Stack (web/)

 -  Uses explicit translation string IDs with JSON files
 -  Translation files: `web/locales/{locale}.json`
 -  Terminology glossary: Located at the top of each JSON file under “glossary”
    key
 -  Usage: Access translations via i18n functions with string IDs

### New Stack (web-next/)

 -  Uses Lingui with gettext-style approach (source text as key)
 -  Translation files: `web-next/src/locales/{locale}/messages.po`
 -  Terminology glossaries: `web-next/src/locales/{locale}/glossary.txt`
 -  Supported locales: en-US, ja-JP, ko-KR, zh-CN, zh-TW
 -  Language selection: URL query parameter `?lang={locale}` or Accept-Language
    header

### Translation Usage in New Stack

 -  Import: `import { msg, plural, useLingui } from "~/lib/i18n/macro.d.ts"`
 -  Simple translation: `const { t } = useLingui(); t\`Hello world\`\`
 -  With pluralization:
    `const { i18n } = useLingui(); i18n._(msg\`${plural(count, { one: “#
    follower”, other: “# followers” })}\`)\`

### Translation Guidelines for New Stack

 -  Always reference the appropriate glossary file when translating
 -  Use consistent terminology across the application as defined in glossaries
 -  For technical terms, follow the glossary mappings (e.g., “post” →
    “コンテンツ” in Japanese)
 -  Maintain proper pluralization rules in .po files
 -  Test translations with `?lang={locale}` parameter
