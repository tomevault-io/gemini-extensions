> Use Bun instead of Node.js, npm, pnpm, or vite.


Default to using Bun instead of Node.js.

- Use `bun <file>` instead of `node <file>` or `ts-node <file>`
- Use `bun test` instead of `jest` or `vitest`
- Use `bun build <file.html|file.ts|file.css>` instead of `webpack` or `esbuild`
- Use `bun install` instead of `npm install` or `yarn install` or `pnpm install`
- Use `bun run <script>` instead of `npm run <script>` or `yarn run <script>` or `pnpm run <script>`
- Use `bunx <package> <command>` instead of `npx <package> <command>`
- Bun automatically loads .env, so don't use dotenv.

## APIs

- `Bun.serve()` supports WebSockets, HTTPS, and routes. Don't use `express`.
- `bun:sqlite` for SQLite. Don't use `better-sqlite3`.
- `Bun.redis` for Redis. Don't use `ioredis`.
- `Bun.sql` for Postgres. Don't use `pg` or `postgres.js`.
- `WebSocket` is built-in. Don't use `ws`.
- Prefer `Bun.file` over `node:fs`'s readFile/writeFile
- Bun.$`ls` instead of execa.

## Testing

Use `bun test` to run tests.

```ts#index.test.ts
import { test, expect } from "bun:test";

test("hello world", () => {
  expect(1).toBe(1);
});
```

## Frontend

Use HTML imports with `Bun.serve()`. Don't use `vite`. HTML imports fully support React, CSS, Tailwind.

Server:

```ts#index.ts
import index from "./index.html"

Bun.serve({
  routes: {
    "/": index,
    "/api/users/:id": {
      GET: (req) => {
        return new Response(JSON.stringify({ id: req.params.id }));
      },
    },
  },
  // optional websocket support
  websocket: {
    open: (ws) => {
      ws.send("Hello, world!");
    },
    message: (ws, message) => {
      ws.send(message);
    },
    close: (ws) => {
      // handle close
    }
  },
  development: {
    hmr: true,
    console: true,
  }
})
```

HTML files can import .tsx, .jsx or .js files directly and Bun's bundler will transpile & bundle automatically. `<link>` tags can point to stylesheets and Bun's CSS bundler will bundle.

```html#index.html
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
    <script type="module" src="./frontend.tsx"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

With the following `frontend.tsx`:

```tsx#frontend.tsx
import React from "react";
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";

// import .css files directly and it works
import './index.css';

const root = createRoot(document.body);

export default function Frontend() {
  return <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
}

root.render(<Frontend />);
```

Then, run index.ts

```sh
bun --hot ./index.ts
```

For more information, read the Bun API docs in `node_modules/bun-types/docs/**.mdx`.

## Git workflow

- **PR-first.** Immediately after the user agrees on a scope/plan, the next action is `gh pr create --draft`. Order: branch → one initial commit → push → `gh pr create --draft` → then implement. The draft PR is the persistence anchor — without it, cron/loop-mode resumption has nothing to observe.
- The draft PR body uses this structure (so a resuming iteration knows where to pick up): `## In scope`, `## Explicitly out of scope`, `## Design rules applied`, `## Verifiability` (exact commands to run), `## Status` (Done / Remaining / Mark-ready criteria — keep this updated as work progresses via `gh pr edit`).
- Open one PR per feature. Don't bundle multiple features.
- Commit periodically — at milestones, a passing test, a working module, a completed sub-task. Don't pile up uncommitted work.
- `gh pr ready <num>` only after `bun typecheck && bun test` are green locally AND the manual verification command in the PR body succeeds.
- After marking ready in an interactive session, `gh pr view <num> --web` to open it in the user's browser for review. Skip in headless cron iterations.
- Never add `Co-Authored-By:` trailers to commits or PRs. Strip the default Claude Code co-author trailer before committing.

## Engineering rules — read every time

These rules override convenience, "best practice" muscle memory, and the urge to be thorough. Violate them and the codebase becomes the wrong thing.

### Crash over limp

When the program encounters state it doesn't expect — at any layer — **CRASH**. Do not try to recover. Do not log a warning and continue. Do not return `null` and let the next layer deal with it.

- Only catch errors you can name a specific recovery path for (`LLMRateLimit` → sleep + retry, `ToolFailure` → emit error tool_result for the model). Everything else propagates.
- Exhaustive `switch` with `assertNever` in the `default` branch.
- Invariant assertions at module entry — throw if precondition violated.
- A crash with a stack trace is infinitely cheaper to debug than a label committed with wrong data ten layers from the bug.

### No fallback values

Never invent a value to fill a missing/wrong-typed one.

- ❌ `const score = thing.score ?? 0`
- ❌ `const items = data.items ?? []`
- ❌ `const n = Number(input) || 0`
- ✅ `if (thing.score === undefined) throw new Error(...)` then `const score = thing.score`
- ✅ Schema-validate at boundaries (`zod.parse`), trust types internally
- ✅ Optional values get explicit `if (x === undefined)` branches — a real branch, not a silent substitute

### Single source of truth — never duplicate defaults

NEVER do this:
```ts
function foo(value = 20) { ... }     // default here
const value = 20                      // ALSO here
foo(value)                            // AND passed redundantly
```

Define the constant once, drop the parameter default, pass explicitly. Three places saying `20` means refactor will miss one.

### Always simplest

Always implement the most simplistic version that satisfies the CURRENT requirement.

- No speculative abstractions. No `interface` until 2+ implementers exist AND callers benefit from the abstraction.
- No options-object fields that nobody sets to non-default.
- No factory / strategy / mediator patterns until the codebase TODAY has 3+ instances of the pattern.
- Inline values used in one place. Extract on the third occurrence, not the second.
- Procedural code is fine; classes only when state + behavior cohere.
- Speed comes from writing less.
- **Tiebreaker:** when simplest-thing conflicts with single-source-of-truth, pick single-source. Duplicate truths rot; one extra `import` does not.

### No backward compatibility

When goals change or an approach is wrong: **delete the old code, rewrite, update every caller in the same PR.**

- No `legacy_*` aliases, no `v2_*` flags, no re-export shims, no commented-out "previous implementation" blocks.
- No translation layers that convert old config/data shapes to new.
- The codebase reflects the CURRENT correct design at all times, not a fossil record.
- Pre-v1 means no external API consumers — internal back-compat is pure cost.

### Always buildable + concentric

- Every commit: `bun typecheck && bun test` passes; the product runs end-to-end.
- Grow concentrically — smallest working core first, then rings outward. Each ring is small, additive, runnable, tested.
- No "half-landed and broken; will fix in next commit." If a change would break the build, land it complete or don't land it.
- When tempted to write a 600-LOC PR: split into 3-5 PRs that each leave the system runnable.

### Production bar only

Don't ship non-production-ready code or anything carrying major security risk.

- No `TODO: replace this in prod` stubs in live code paths.
- No disabled TLS, no hardcoded keys, no `eval` of user input.
- No bypassing `Redacted<T>`, `permission.assert()`, schema validation, audit logging, or output bounding "to make the test pass."
- If a piece can't meet the bar in scope, STOP and surface it; don't half-land it.

### No emoji

No emoji anywhere — not in code, comments, commit messages, PR titles/bodies, docs, ASCII diagrams, or chat output. Use plain text words instead (`done`, `in progress`, `warning:`, etc.). Only exception: when the user explicitly asks for them in a specific context.

### Tests pair with implementation

Tests are how we keep the codebase maintainable, understandable, and reliable. They ship in the same PR as the code they test.

- Every PR that adds behavior adds tests for that behavior. Not "TODO: test later."
- Tests document — names are sentences (`"commits when 2/3 verifiers agree"` not `"test1"`).
- Test against real implementations: `:memory:` SQLite, real Zod schemas, real workflow runner. Avoid mocks (per `TESTING.md`).
- Test behavior at boundaries, not internal helpers / call counts / private state.
- Tests are deterministic: no `Date.now()` in test bodies (use `BASELINE_TIME = 1700000000000`), no network in unit tests (use cassettes for LLM).
- When fixing a bug: write the failing test FIRST that reproduces it, then fix.
- One assertion per `it()` is a good default; multiple OK when they describe one coherent claim.
- If a test is hard to write, the implementation interface is wrong — simplify before forcing the test.
