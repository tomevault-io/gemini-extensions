# Prototype Instructions

Run the local server yourself and open the preview in the browser available to this environment. Do not give the user server-start instructions when you can run it.

Before making substantial visual changes, use the Product Design plugin's `get-context` skill when the visual source is unclear or no longer matches the current goal. When the user gives durable prototype-specific design feedback, preferences, or decisions, record them in `AGENTS.md`.

When implementing from a selected generated mock, treat that image as the source of truth for layout, component anatomy, density, spacing, color, typography, visible content, and hierarchy.

The selected visual direction is the first generated option: a warm off-white, single-column Spotlight-style clipboard overlay with muted sage accents, lightweight list separators, text and image history rows, and keyboard-first controls.

Pasting must feel immediate: keep the local click-to-paste path free of per-action process startup and target roughly 35ms before sending Ctrl+V. Remote-control windows may use a separate longer synchronization delay so their compatibility does not slow normal local pasting.

Screenshot workflow: triggering capture freezes the current mouse display and creates a compact cursor-centered preselection on the full-screen canvas. That preselection remains freely movable, resizable from edges/corners, or replaceable until the user chooses an annotation tool or executes save/copy/pin. Ctrl+C copies, Ctrl+P pins, Enter saves. Capture, quick capture-and-pin, and screenshot-history global shortcuts are user-configurable and must be visible at the top of settings with a labeled main-window entry.

Initial selection tracking: while the cursor-centered preselection is still only a suggestion, it follows the live mouse position and clamps to the captured display edges. The first normal left-button press stops tracking; dragging from that press replaces the suggestion with a custom rectangle, while a click without a meaningful drag keeps the current rectangle fixed. Returning to the automatic suggestion with right-click resumes tracking.

Snipaste-style reference interaction: capture must start with a cursor-centered 520 × 320 preselection and must not auto-select the foreground window. Keep the selection freely replaceable before annotation, support 1px arrow-key movement and Shift+arrow resizing, show live pixel color and selection dimensions, and provide pen, arrow, rectangle, ellipse, color, width, undo, and redo controls. Enter or double-click copies and finishes; F4 copies and pins; right-click steps back. Follow the interaction model without copying Snipaste branding or assets.

Selection correction: the automatic selection is only a starting suggestion. A normal left-button drag anywhere on the frozen screen, including inside the suggested selection, must start a new rectangle from that pointer position. Edge and corner drags resize; Alt+drag inside moves the whole selection. F4 must both copy the final crop to the clipboard and pin it to the desktop.

Exact pin fidelity: a newly captured F4 pin must place its image content at the original selection's desktop x/y and logical width/height, converting from captured physical pixels using the active display bounds. A transparent outer margin may hold the distinguishing shadow only when the pin window is offset and expanded by the same margin, so the image pixels still visually complete the frozen source page at 1:1 desktop scale. Never use contain-fit letterboxing. After creation, the mouse wheel zooms around the pointer while preserving aspect ratio, and dragging moves the pin.

Screenshot launch performance: keep the screenshot editor window preloaded and hidden between captures. Do not query foreground-window bounds for initial selection. Skip the hide delay when Pasty UI is already hidden, use only one compositor frame when visible Pasty UI must be removed, and never show the editor until the frozen image has decoded and rendered. Saving or F4 pinning must render the crop directly from the frozen image and annotations without waiting for selection-overlay animation frames. Pins may use a subtle shadow margin only if the image content retains its original position and size.

Reliability correction: the preloaded screenshot renderer must explicitly announce readiness only after its `screenshot:begin` listener is registered; main must queue the latest capture payload until that handshake arrives. For exact pins, use Electron content bounds at the mapped selection rectangle rather than compensating with a CSS shadow margin or assuming frameless resizable window bounds equal web-content bounds.

Hidden-renderer correction: the preloaded screenshot window must set `backgroundThrottling: false`, because its image-ready handshake uses render frames while the window is hidden. Keep a short idempotent timer fallback so capture cannot remain invisible if the compositor does not schedule a hidden frame.

F4 reliability: explicit screenshot save/pin actions must bypass clipboard-poll duplicate suppression. Repeating the same crop is still a deliberate user action and must create or resolve a valid screenshot entry, copy it, and open a pin instead of returning “截图没有变化”.

F4 input ownership: register native global F4 as soon as a screenshot editor task is queued, forward it to the editor as `screenshot:pin-request` while visible, and unregister it immediately when the editor hides. Keep the renderer key handler only as a fallback. This prevents focus, IME, registration latency, or embedded-page keyboard delivery from silently dropping the pin action.

Pin visibility ordering: after F4 has copied the crop, hide the fullscreen screenshot editor before creating or revealing the pin. Show the pin as an activated window, reassert the highest appropriate always-on-top level, call `moveTop`, and check the pin creation result. Never use `showInactive` for the just-created F4 pin because it may remain visually behind the capture layer or source app.

Pin launch performance: keep one hidden pin renderer preloaded at application startup. F4 should assign the saved image to this warm window and reveal it as soon as the image reports ready, while a replacement shell is warmed in the background. Do not create and load the first visible pin window from scratch after F4.

Screenshot persistence performance: explicit screenshot save/pin may reuse the renderer-provided PNG bytes instead of re-encoding through `nativeImage.toPNG`. Persist new screenshot files and the JSON store asynchronously, serialize store writes by revision, and cache history thumbnails. The pin must not wait for disk persistence or a full-history thumbnail rebuild; perform a synchronous store flush only during shutdown.

Shortcut settings use key-recording controls rather than editable text. While a recorder is focused, configurable global shortcuts are suspended so the pressed chord cannot hide or switch the window. Save the application shortcut, three screenshot global shortcuts, and the screenshot-history local pin action atomically, show conflicts inline, and keep the Save action visible in a fixed dialog footer. The history pin action may use a single key such as Enter and must never be registered globally.

Desktop screenshot pins are session-only windows. Never persist or automatically restore pinned screenshot windows across app restarts; screenshot history remains durable and users can pin an older screenshot again from history when needed.

Pinned screenshot context actions: every desktop pin must keep its hover close button and expose a native right-click menu that works outside the pin's clipped content bounds. The menu provides save-to-file, reopen annotation, rotate left/right, horizontal/vertical mirror, zoom in/out/reset, and close. Image transforms are session-local, preserve the pin center and aspect ratio, invalidate OCR for the old raster, and all later OCR, save, or annotation work must use the currently transformed image. Secondary annotation opens at the pin's current desktop x/y and logical width/height without fit-to-screen upscaling, adds only a transparent outer margin for a soft source-image shadow, and defaults to the pen tool. Canceling returns to the unchanged pin and completing replaces the current session pin raster. A pin's hover close button must close on pointer-down through a sender-window IPC that does not depend on the pin ID or a completed click; Escape closes a pin outside text mode. The native context-menu close action remains a direct main-process window destroy.

Pinned screenshot text selection: a stationary left-button hold on a desktop pin enters an offline OCR-backed text mode; it must not copy the entire recognized image by default. Text mode overlays character-level hit boxes at the original image coordinates, supports press-drag selection with browser-like blue highlighting, double-click word selection, Ctrl+C or a compact action to copy only the selected Chinese, English, numbers, and punctuation, and Escape/Done to return to pin dragging. OCR loads lazily so pin creation remains fast, reuses one worker, and stays aligned through pin zoom without changing the pin's position or size.

Pinned text rendering fidelity: OCR text is coordinate and clipboard data only. Never redraw recognized characters over the pinned image; the selection layer must use empty hit boxes with a translucent blue highlight so the original screenshot text remains visible even when OCR is imperfect.

Pinned text gesture and copy fidelity: text selection should feel like selecting in an ordinary document. Start OCR on the first pointer press, enter selection after a light hold of roughly 180ms, preserve the press anchor and latest pointer position while OCR is pending, and apply the selection even if the pointer is released before recognition completes. Keep fast drags available for moving the pin. While text mode is active, only direct OCR character-box hits select text; dragging a blank image area exits text mode and moves the pin. A successful copy also exits text mode immediately so normal dragging resumes. When copying, remove OCR-invented spaces between adjacent Chinese characters and around punctuation without collapsing meaningful Latin/number spacing.

Pinned OCR cache and quality: after a pin image is visibly ready, begin OCR in the background and share a bounded session LRU cache between pre-recognition and user-triggered selection so each image is recognized only once. Keep pin reveal non-blocking. Upscale small images for OCR, and when the primary Chinese/English pass has low confidence, retry with an alternate page-segmentation mode and retain the stronger selectable result.

Pinned Chinese OCR engine: use the bundled offline PaddleOCR/ONNX model as the primary recognizer for Chinese screenshot pins, with Tesseract only as a failure fallback. Filter isolated low-confidence Paddle lines when stronger lines exist, preserve Paddle reading order, and derive selectable character hit boxes from its line polygons. High numeric confidence alone is not proof of correct Chinese; verify representative text content such as 滑动 and 质量 directly.

Screenshot text annotation: the annotation toolbar includes a text tool alongside pen, arrow, rectangle, and ellipse. Drag inside the selected screenshot to define a text box; a click creates a sensible default-sized box. The editor must focus immediately, preserve Chinese/Latin text and line breaks, use Enter for a new line, Ctrl+Enter to commit, and Escape to cancel only the active text box. Switching tools or executing save/copy/pin commits non-empty text as a rasterized, undoable annotation using the selected color and size.

Build app UI in `src/`. Keep `.openai/hosting.json`, `worker/index.js`, `scripts/prepare-sites-build.mjs`, and `tests/sites-worker.test.mjs` intact so the same local prototype can be handed to Sites. Before a Sites handoff, run `npm run build` and `npm run test:sites`; the build must leave `dist/client/index.html`, `dist/server/index.js`, and `dist/.openai/hosting.json`.

Windows distribution and background presence: ship Pasty as an installable NSIS `.exe` with its own application icon. While the app is running in the background, keep a visible Windows system-tray icon with actions for opening Pasty, capture, quick capture-and-pin, screenshot history, and a real application exit. Closing or blurring the floating window continues to hide it without terminating the background process.

Main-window close affordance: keep a visible close button at the top-right of the main clipboard window beside Add. Activating it must hide the floating window exactly like Escape or window close, while leaving the tray icon, clipboard monitor, and global shortcuts running; only the tray Exit action or settings Quit may terminate the application.
