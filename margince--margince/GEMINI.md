> **This is the only copy of the repository-wide rules.** Every harness reads it:

# AGENTS.md — the rulebook

**This is the only copy of the repository-wide rules.** Every harness reads it:
`AGENTS.md` is the convention Codex and the others look for, and Claude Code
reaches it through a one-line `CLAUDE.md` that imports it. Do not add a second
copy — `backend/gates/rulebookdelegation_test.go` fails one.

A directory may carry its own `AGENTS.md` for rules that bind only inside it —
`frontend/AGENTS.md` does. Such a file only ADDS: it states what is true in that
directory and nothing more, never overriding a rule here and never restating one.
A rule that binds the whole tree belongs in this file instead.

**Rules live here; everything else lives in [docs/](docs/README.md).** Every line
here is paid for by every session — the right price for a rule that binds a change,
the wrong one for a procedure, a catalog or an explanation. `cli/craft` feeds this
file's `## Craftsmanship` section into its gate prompt, so that section must stay.
Links point one way: down into `docs/`, never back up.

Margince CRM: the running Go software, its contract, its tests and its docs are
the product, and no separate specification outranks them.

## What decides a question

1. The current request from Lars or the team.
2. Code, tests, migrations and `backend/api/crm.yaml` — what the product does today.
3. Guardrails: security, privacy, agent authority, auditability, public contract
   compatibility, licensing, data durability. Each is enforced by a gate; read the
   gate, because it states the obligation in a form that fails.
4. [docs/](docs/README.md) — how the product is built and operated.

Do not refuse or narrow ordinary product evolution because an older document
disagrees. Name the conflict, say what it costs, and keep going. If the call is
genuinely someone else's, say whose and open an issue labelled
`status: needs-decision`.

The product is **Margince**. Older documents say "Gradion CRM" — same product.

## This repository is public

- **Never name a private repository, document, path or link** — not in code,
  comments, tests, docs, issues, commits or PR bodies. A public contributor must
  be able to follow every instruction here. Write the rule out instead of citing
  somewhere they cannot reach.
- **Never commit a local machine path or a secret.**

`backend/gates/publicreferences_test.go` catches what a test can: a private repo name,
a `specs/` path, a `foundation#NNNN` reference. It does not read commit messages
or PR bodies and has no pattern for a secret — those are your judgement.

A decision number (`ADR-0054`) may appear as a label. Never cite it as though a
reader could open it; the records are not in this tree.

## How you work here

**Fix it, don't file it.** Default: fix what you find, in the same change. Open an
issue only when the fix lives in another module, needs a product or architecture
decision, or would double the diff. Say in the PR body what you fixed along the
way.

**One PR per piece of work.** Do not split related work across several small PRs
— each one costs a full CI run. One branch, one PR.

**Clean up when you are done.** Remove your worktree, delete the branch local and
remote, and stop your dev stack (`make dev-stop`).

**Start in `docs/`.** To learn how something works, read `docs/` first — it is
written for you as much as for a human. The code is still the authority on
current behaviour, so check the code before you rely on a doc for anything a
patch depends on.

**A security hole is never a public issue.** [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) routes an
exploitable weakness to a private advisory. The test: if you can write the
reproduction, it belongs in an advisory, not here.

Every issue you do open carries exactly one `priority:` and exactly one `area:`,
plus `status:` when it is not yet workable. Unlabelled means nobody has looked at
it yet, so filing without labels tells the next reader something false. The full
taxonomy: [docs/reference/issue-labels.md](docs/reference/issue-labels.md).

## Build and test

`make check` is the merge gate (`check-backend` + `check-fe`). Run it before you
push. `make test-integration` is the real-Postgres lane and needs `make db-up`;
it fails loudly without a database rather than skipping, because a skipped
security gate looks exactly like a passing one.

**While you iterate, run the narrowest lane that can fail**: `make check-go` for
backend Go, `make check-gates` for a gate under `backend/gates/`, `make check-fe`
or one leg (`fe-unit`, `fe-lint`) for `frontend/`, `make test-it DIR=<pkg>
[RUN=<Test>]` for one integration package. That is the inner loop and never a
substitute — a narrow run proves the part you looked at, not the part you forgot,
and `make check` prints where its time went when you want to make it faster.

All Go lives under `backend/` (one module); the root Makefile delegates there.
Three binaries, all wired through `internal/compose`: `cmd/api`, `cmd/worker`,
`cmd/migrate`.

Commands and flags: [docs/reference/make-targets.md](docs/reference/make-targets.md).
Config and endpoints: [docs/reference/configuration.md](docs/reference/configuration.md).
CI: [infra/ci-pipeline.md](infra/ci-pipeline.md).

## One dev stack per worktree

`make dev` starts a stack for THIS worktree and touches nobody else's: a linked
worktree claims its own database, Redis logical database, port pair and object
bucket, with no flag to remember. The primary worktree keeps `:8080` and the
shared `margince` database, which is what `make migrate` and `make seed-dev`
target. `make dev-stop` stops this worktree's; `make dev-sweep` clears every
stack on the machine and is the only thing that does.

**The API does not hot-reload.** Vite does, so the frontend is live as you type;
the API is a compiled binary and every backend change needs `make dev` again. A
stale one keeps answering happily, so the app breaks exactly like your own bug.

Before you trust any manual test, confirm both: `git branch --show-current` is
the branch you think it is, and the **API process** was started after your last
backend change — not the app port, which is Vite and hot-reloads. The API is
behind it on the port the startup banner prints.

## Shipping a change

Direct pushes to `main` are blocked. There is no other path to merge.

**Run git and `gh` with host access.** In a sandboxed session `gh auth status` is
not authoritative — the sandbox may not see the host keychain. Every remote
mutation needs host escalation: branch, commit, rebase, push, PR create/edit/merge,
check monitoring. Read-only inspection (`git status`, `diff`, `log`) can stay
sandboxed.

1. Branch off `main`: `git switch -c <type>/<slug> origin/main`.
2. Sign off every commit (`git commit -s`) — the DCO gate rejects any commit
   without a `Signed-off-by` trailer.
3. Run `make check` before pushing — it is both halves, `frontend/` included,
   with nothing to add on top. The pre-push hook runs `craft static --strict`
   diff-scoped too — fix what it finds, never bypass it; install it via `make hooks`.
4. Push and open a PR.
5. CI, DCO, CodeRabbit and SonarCloud must all pass. Address review findings
   rather than dismissing them.
6. Merge only when everything is green: `gh pr merge <n> --squash`, never with a
   replaced body — it drops the commits' sign-off. Then delete the branch.

**Commit only product.** Before `git add`, check `git status` for build caches
(`node_modules/`, `.pnpm-store/`, binaries), working notes — those go in the
session scratchpad, not the repo — and screenshots. `.gitignore` catches the known
offenders; a new debris path is still yours to keep out, and to add there.

## Layout

The DAG is `shared → platform → modules → compose → cmd`, enforced three ways
(depguard, go-arch-lint, `backend/gates/arch_test.go`). Four rules bind a diff:

1. **A module never imports a sibling, and never `compose`.** If A needs B,
   `compose` injects the edge. Your own copy will always look cheaper.
2. **A module writes only the tables it owns**, declared in its `doc.go` and gated
   by `backend/gates/tableownership_test.go`.
3. **Two spine shapes, and only two** — *Handlers→Store* for CRUD modules,
   *Handlers→Service* for engine modules. Do not invent a third.
4. **`internal/contracts/` and `*_gen.go` are generated** from
   `backend/api/crm.yaml`. Never hand-edit; the drift gate fails it.

`extensions/<name>/` is the extension tier: each unit is its own Go module
importing only the allowlisted `backend/pkg/**` surface, and presence under
`extensions/` is the enablement.

Working in `frontend/`? It has its own [AGENTS.md](frontend/AGENTS.md), which
opens with the design-system catalog. Read that catalog before building anything
visible — nothing automated can tell that the component you just wrote already
existed under another name, which is how this tree twice grew a second spelling
of a card.

Where each directory and module sits:
[docs/explanation/architecture.md](docs/explanation/architecture.md) and
[docs/reference/modules.md](docs/reference/modules.md). Read the latter to place a
change rather than guessing from the package name.

## Do not touch

- **A shipped migration in `migrations/core/`** — additive only. An applied
  version never re-runs, so editing one changes what FRESH installations get
  while deployed databases keep the old behaviour, and the two diverge silently.
  A new migration goes after the `0001` baseline, named for the unix second it
  was written, and updates `migrations/testdata/head_catalog.txt` in the same
  commit. Why the two historical exceptions were safe, and why neither
  generalizes: [docs/how-to/apply-migrations.md](docs/how-to/apply-migrations.md).
- **The `database.WithWorkspaceTx` contract** — every tenant query goes through
  it; there is no raw-pool path for tenant data. Held by
  `scripts/check-rls-store-path.sh`. No table carries row-level security: a unit
  table declares no `workspace_id` and no policy; `extmigrategate` refuses one.
- **`internal/shared/apperrors`** — a fixed sentinel registry. Extend it only
  alongside the error contract it implements, never for one call site.

## The write shape

Every mutation commits domain row + `audit_log` row + `event_outbox` row in ONE
transaction, spelled once in `platform/database/storekit` (`Audit` + `Emit`) and
called by every module store. `captured_by` comes from the authenticated
principal, never the request body. The HTTP layer mints one `correlation_id` per
request and `Emit` links it to the audit row id, so one request's domain change,
audit entry and event are recoverable as one trace. Publishing is always through
the outbox (`platform/events.Relay`) — no direct XADD from domain code — and
consumers wrap handlers in `events.Dedupe` because the bus is at-least-once.

Every store entry point is RBAC-gated (`auth.Require`, `auth.EnsureVisible`, and
the list scope clauses in `platform/auth`): object denial →
`apperrors.ErrPermissionDenied` (403); row-scope miss → `apperrors.ErrNotFound`
(404, so existence stays hidden).

## Reuse before you build

A second implementation of one capability is two answers to one question, and the
two drift until they disagree in front of a user.

1. **Search the whole tree, not your directory.** Grep the capability's nouns
   across `backend/`, `frontend/src/` and `extensions/` first. The duplicate is
   almost never in the package you are editing.
2. **The tool surface and the web surface share ONE engine.** An MCP tool never
   re-derives what an HTTP handler computes; the binding is a `compose/*seam*.go`
   file. If no seam exists, write the seam — do not write a second assembler.
3. **Never hand-type a SQL placeholder.** Derive `$N` from the argument slice, or
   use `storekit.InsertFragments`. Nothing checks that a statement's column,
   placeholder and argument counts agree. Only identifiers are ever formatted in,
   and only as a compile-time literal or a catalog name through
   `pgx.Identifier.Sanitize` — never a string off a request body.
4. **A comment may not claim to be the only implementation unless a test holds
   it.** If no test fails when a second appears, delete the claim or write the
   test. Nine of ten such claims in this tree were false, and a false one is
   worse than silence: the next author greps, finds it, and stops looking.
5. **A gate that hard-codes part of its subject has become a second copy of it.**
   Derive the gate's corpus from the owner it protects, or say in the test why you
   cannot.

**Two writers of one invariant either share a helper or say why they do not** —
in the code beside it, not in the PR where the next reader will not see it.

The incidents behind these, and the scan for auditing a subsystem:
[docs/principles/one-source-of-truth.md](docs/principles/one-source-of-truth.md).

## Craftsmanship

The rule under every rule: **code that reads best to a human reads best to the
next agent that edits it.** Legibility is the product.

The standard the gate applies is `cli/craft/rubric/rubric.json` — anti-tells
T1–T11 plus positive rules P1–P5 (idiomatic, small-focused, tests-as-spec,
pr-tells-story, restraint). When this prose and the rubric disagree, the rubric is
what blocked your push.

- Comments say *why*, not *what* (T1). Domain names, not `data`/`tmp`/`helper` (T4).
- **Never swallow an error** (T2) — no `_ = f()`, no empty `catch`, no ignored
  return. Errors flow through the sentinels; messages say what went wrong and what
  to do, and never leak internals (no stack, SQL or table names to a client).
- No `any`, `as`, or unchecked assertions (T6). No dead or speculative code, no
  abstraction without a second caller today, no `TODO` without an issue (T3/T8).
- **Search the tree before you add a capability** (T11) — *Reuse before you
  build*, asked of a reviewer. MAJOR, never BLOCKER: a reviewer sees the diff
  and not the tree, so it raises the question rather than vetoing.
- Handle the honest hard cases (T7): empty page, version skew, cross-tenant,
  GUC unset.
- **Tests prove behaviour or they are noise** (P3): no assertion-free test, no
  `time.Sleep` or real-clock or real-network flakiness, no over-mocking that
  asserts call order. Mock only true boundaries (DB, HTTP, clock, queue) and
  inject a `Clock`. Tests read as specs.
- Before you submit: would a senior write it this way? Does it match the
  surrounding file? Is it the smallest diff that does the job?

**The gate runs before every push, diff-scoped, and it is strict.**
`.githooks/pre-push` runs `craft static --strict` over the Go files this push
changes vs `origin/main`, across `backend/`, `extensions/`, `fixtures/` and
`desktop/`. There is no backlog to exempt — the tree was cleared to zero before
this bar was armed, so the rule is simply that touched code is clean.

- `BLOCKER` and `MAJOR` both block; `MINOR` is advisory.
- Size ceilings: 80 code lines per function and 500 per file; 160 and 1000 for
  `*_test.go`. A comment-only line is not length for the function ceiling — it
  asks how much a reader must hold at once, and an explanation reduces that.
- Waive a genuine false positive in source, with a reason:
  `//craft:ignore <check> <reason>`. A reasonless waiver is itself a finding.
- Whole-tree sweep: `make craft-static`. CI runs the same bar.

## License headers

Every hand-written `*.go` file starts with these two lines, above `package`,
followed by a blank line:

```go
// SPDX-License-Identifier: BUSL-1.1
// SPDX-FileCopyrightText: 2026 Gradion
```

Exempt: `*_gen.go` and `internal/contracts/`. Keep the year as `2026` — it names
the release year, not the current one. `backend/gates/license_test.go` derives the file
list from the tree, so a new file that skips the header fails the gate. This is
the licence model's honest-labelling obligation:
[docs/reference/license-release-rule.md](docs/reference/license-release-rule.md).

## Rules learned from the review loop

1. **Fix the invariant, not the call site.** Grep every read and write of the same
   column, constraint or record and fix them as one change. The recurring
   reviewer catch here was "fixed the case under review, missed the sibling copy".
2. **Prefer a fitness function to a point fix.** Derive the obligation from the
   system rather than maintaining it as a list.
3. **Anything that returns a record is a read**, and carries the row-scope gate —
   including replay, conflict and error paths.
4. **No build-process residue in comments.** No ticket numbers, no fix narration.
   State the invariant so it stands alone. History belongs to git. Same for test
   names.
5. **Never rationalise a known gap in a comment.** Restructure it away or gate it
   with a test.
6. **A test that supplies its own version of production proves nothing about
   production.** Seed through the real writer; if a test needs the wiring, reach
   for the wiring. An unexpectedly uncovered new file usually means a test double
   stands where the real thing should.
7. **One invariant spelled on both sides of a wire is ONE item.** Fixing one side
   alone can be a regression rather than half a fix: a money scale wrong in both
   directions cancels, the screen agrees with itself, and making the server
   correct by itself prints a hundred times the price on the offer a buyer signs.
   Land both sides in one change, then make one a declared mirror of the other
   held by a gate that fails in both directions — `values.MinorUnitExceptions()`
   against `frontend/src/format/minorunits.ts`, in
   `backend/gates/frontendminorunits_test.go`, is the worked example.
8. **A census that can fail short has already failed.** Under-recognition is the
   one way a gate must not break: it reads a smaller tree, reports PASS, and there
   is no failing assertion to notice. No prefilter or skip-list in front of a scan
   unless you have measured that it buys something; match statements, not lines;
   and once it is green, ask what shape of the defect it cannot see and plant that
   case.
