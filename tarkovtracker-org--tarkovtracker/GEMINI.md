# GitHub Copilot Instructions for TarkovTracker

## Project Overview

TarkovTracker is a Nuxt 4 Single Page Application (SPA) for tracking Escape from Tarkov game progress. The app runs client-side only (`ssr: false`) with Nitro server routes for API proxying.

**Tech Stack:**

- Nuxt 4 with Vue 3 Composition API
- TypeScript (strict mode)
- Pinia for state management
- Supabase for auth, database, and realtime
- Cloudflare Pages/Workers for deployment
- Tailwind CSS v4 (no SCSS/scoped styles)
- Vitest + Vue Test Utils for testing

## Commands

**Prerequisites:** Node.js >=24.12.0 and npm >=11.6.2 (see `package.json` engines). No additional environment variables are required for local development.

```bash
npm run dev             # Dev server at localhost:3000
npm run build           # Production SPA build
npm run lint            # ESLint with zero warnings (enforced by CI/pre-commit hooks)
npm run lint:fix        # Auto-fix lint issues
npm run format          # Prettier + ESLint fix (run before lint to auto-fix formatting)
npx vitest              # Run unit tests
npx vitest --ui         # Tests with dashboard
```

**Recommended workflow:** Run `npm run format` before `npm run lint` to auto-fix formatting issues. The lint step enforces zero warnings as a hard requirement in CI and pre-commit hooks.

## Code Style Requirements

### Formatting (Prettier)

- 2-space indentation
- 100-character line width
- Single quotes for strings
- Semicolons required
- Trailing commas (es5 style)
- LF line endings

### Vue Single File Components

Always use this structure:

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
  // Indented script content (vueIndentScriptAndStyle: true)
</script>

<template>
  <!-- Template content with Tailwind classes -->
</template>
```

**No `<style>` blocks.** Use Tailwind CSS v4 utilities exclusively. For complex animations or utilities not available in Tailwind, add them to `app/assets/css/tailwind.css`.

### Import Rules (Critical)

1. **Never use parent-relative imports** - Use `@/` or `~/` aliases instead

   ```typescript
   // WRONG
   import { foo } from '../../utils/foo';

   // CORRECT
   import { foo } from '@/utils/foo';
   ```

2. **No blank lines between import groups**
3. **Alphabetically sorted imports** (case-insensitive)
4. **Import group order:** builtin → external → internal → parent → sibling → index → object → type

### TypeScript Guidelines

- Prefer explicit types for exported functions, stores, and composables
- Avoid `any`; use `unknown` with type narrowing
- Use union/string literal types for constrained values
- Use `as const` for literal inference
- Keep types close to usage; reuse existing types

### Naming Conventions

- **Components:** PascalCase (`TaskCard.vue`)
- **Composables:** camelCase with `use` prefix (`useTaskFiltering.ts`)
- **Stores:** `useXStore` pattern (`useProgress.ts`)
- **Routes/files:** kebab-case (`needed-items.vue`)
- **Test files:** `*.test.ts` in `__tests__/` folders
- **Constants:** UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for globals

## State Management (Three-Store Architecture)

```typescript
// useMetadata - Static game data from tarkov.dev API
const metadata = useMetadata();

// useProgress - User progress state (completions, objectives)
const progress = useProgress();

// usePreferences - User settings with localStorage persistence
const preferences = usePreferences();
```

## Key Patterns

### Dual Game Mode

The app tracks PvP and PvE progress separately. Always consider both modes when working with progress data.

### Tarkov.dev Import and Linking

- Persist a single linked `tarkovUid` only.
- Do not add or depend on a persisted linked-mode/imported-mode field.
- Treat PvP/PvE choice for tarkov.dev imports as temporary UI state that decides where imported
  progress is written.
- Accept full tarkov.dev player profile URLs for imports, fetch profile JSON through the local
  `/api/tarkov-dev/profile` route, and reuse the canonical Tarkov.dev profile parser.
- Remind users to open their tarkov.dev profile page before importing because that page visit
  refreshes the public profile JSON.
- Build tarkov.dev profile links from the currently viewed or selected mode to choose the
  `regular` or `pve` URL slug.

### Team System

Real-time sync via Supabase Broadcast. Team/token mutations run through Supabase Edge Functions.

### XP System

Dynamic calculation from tasks with `xpOffset` for manual adjustments.

### Error Handling

```typescript
import { logger } from '@/utils/logger';

try {
  await someAsyncOperation();
} catch (error) {
  logger.error('Feature:Action failed', { context, error });
  // Surface user-friendly message in UI
}
```

## Testing Requirements

- Test files: `*.test.ts` in `__tests__/` folders next to source
- Environment: `nuxt` (handles DOM setup automatically)
- Mock all network/Supabase calls
- Keep tests deterministic and focused

```typescript
import { describe, it, expect, vi } from 'vitest';
import { mountSuspended } from '@nuxt/test-utils/runtime';

describe('ComponentName', () => {
  it('should do something', async () => {
    const wrapper = await mountSuspended(ComponentName);
    expect(wrapper.text()).toContain('expected');
  });
});
```

## Styling Guidelines

- **Tailwind v4 only**—no `<style>` blocks, SCSS, or scoped CSS in components
- Use Tailwind theme layer for colors—no hex values in templates
- For complex animations, define them in `app/assets/css/tailwind.css` using `@theme` or `@keyframes`
- Tailwind classes are auto-sorted by Prettier
- Use `@nuxt/ui` components consistently with existing patterns
- Inline styles are acceptable only for truly dynamic values (e.g., computed positions)

## Localization

- Locale files: `app/locales/*.json`
- `app/locales/en.json` is the source locale and should be reviewed for key structure, placeholders, and source copy.
- Non-English locale files are Crowdin-owned generated exports. Do not review placeholder or untranslated values there unless the PR is explicitly fixing a Crowdin export problem.
- Add keys consistently with existing namespace patterns
- Never hard-code user-facing strings in components
- Provide safe fallback strings

## Server Routes (Nitro)

Server handlers live in `app/server/api/`. Keep them small and composable.

```typescript
// app/server/api/example.get.ts
export default defineEventHandler(async (event) => {
  // Handler logic
});
```

## Security Considerations

- Never expose secrets in client code
- Use `useRuntimeConfig()` for environment values
- Keep secrets out of the repo
- Validate all user inputs on server routes

## Files to Ignore

- `supabase/functions/**` - Deno code with different lint rules
- `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `.nuxt/`

## Agent Rules

- **No over-thinking in responses**. Sacrifice explanatory language for brevity—layman's terms only when necessary.
- **Be concise**. Direct responses only: "Fixed X by changing Y to Z." Minimize explanation unless asked. Use file references for context.
- **No comments** unless explicitly requested. Comments are token overhead.
- **Run `npm run format` once** before leaving code. It handles both formatting and linting. Only show errors, skip success output.
- **Own all issues**. Fix formatting, linting, and pre-existing bugs without being asked. Don't deflect with "these are from earlier changes."
- **Self-assess code**. Don't ask "what does this do?" Read and understand it. Only clarify ambiguous intent ("Is this supposed to do X or Y?").
- **Ask before acting on complex requests**. Clarify ambiguous or multi-interpretation tasks before proceeding—it's better to ask one question than redo work.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. Using SSR-only features (app is SPA-only)
2. Parent-relative imports (`../..`) - blocked by lint
3. Adding blank lines between imports
4. Using hex colors instead of Tailwind theme
5. Forgetting to mock network calls in tests
6. Adding new global state without necessity
7. Deep nesting - prefer early returns
