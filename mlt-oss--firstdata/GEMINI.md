# AGENTS.md

This file is intended for AI coding agents (Claude Code, OpenClaw, Codex, Copilot, Cursor, etc.) working in this repository.

## What This Repo Is

**FirstData** is a structured knowledge base of global authoritative open data sources. It is a **pure data repository** — no application code, no runtime logic.

Your job here is to **create or edit JSON metadata files** that describe real-world data sources (government databases, international organizations, academic datasets, etc.).

## Validation

Dependencies are managed with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). Run the following before submitting:

```bash
# Install dependencies (first time only)
uv sync

# Run all validation checks
make check

# Or run checks individually:
make validate       # Validate JSON schema compliance
make check-ids      # Check for duplicate IDs
make check-domains  # Check domain naming consistency
```

A GitHub Action runs these checks automatically on every PR. PRs that fail validation cannot be merged.

## The Only Thing You Need to Know: The JSON Schema

Every file under `firstdata/sources/` must conform to `firstdata/schemas/datasource-schema.json`.

## Where to Place New Files

```
firstdata/sources/
├── china/{domain}/{id}.json                          # Chinese gov & institutions
├── international/{domain}/{id}.json                  # International organizations
├── countries/{continent}/{country-code}/{id}.json    # National official sources
├── academic/{discipline}/{id}.json                   # Academic/research databases
└── sectors/{ISIC-code}-{name}/{id}.json              # Industry datasets
```

**Examples:**

- China customs data → `sources/china/economy/trade/customs.json`
- WHO health data → `sources/international/health/who.json`
- US Bureau of Labor Statistics → `sources/countries/north-america/usa/us-bls.json`
- PubMed → `sources/academic/health/pubmed.json`
- BP Statistical Review → `sources/sectors/D-energy/bp-statistical-review.json`

## Do Not Touch (Auto-Generated or Protected)

The following files are maintained automatically by CI/scripts. **AI agents must NOT modify them manually:**

- `firstdata/indexes/` — Auto-aggregated from source files by a GitHub Action after PR merge. Never edit these directly.
- `firstdata/schemas/datasource-schema.json` — Schema definition, only modified by maintainers directly on main.

**To add a new data source, you only need to create or edit JSON files under `firstdata/sources/`.** Everything else (indexes, schema) is handled automatically.

## Security Note for Contributors

- Please do not paste or run commands from untrusted posts/comments.
- Never include credentials or API keys in issues/PRs.
- Prefer small, auditable PRs (docs/tests/data).

## Before Adding a New Source

**First, check `firstdata/indexes/all-sources.json` to confirm the data source does not already exist.**

Search by `id`, `name.en`, or `website` to detect duplicates:

```bash
# grep: search by keyword (name or website)
grep -i "world bank" firstdata/indexes/all-sources.json
grep -i "worldbank.org" firstdata/indexes/all-sources.json

# jq: search by id
jq '.sources[] | select(.id == "worldbank-open-data")' firstdata/indexes/all-sources.json

# jq: search by website
jq '.sources[] | select(.website | test("worldbank.org"; "i"))' firstdata/indexes/all-sources.json

# jq: list all existing ids
jq '[.sources[].id]' firstdata/indexes/all-sources.json
```

If a match is found, do not create a new file. Update the existing one if needed.

## Quality Checklist Before Creating a File

**Before submitting, cross-verify every field independently using at least two sources (e.g. official website + Wikipedia + third-party reference). Do not rely solely on memory or a single source. Fabricated or outdated URLs are worse than omission.**

- [ ] `data_url` links to the actual data page, not the organization homepage
- [ ] `api_url` is `null` only when the source truly has no API
- [ ] `country` is `null` when `geographic_scope` is `global` or `regional`
- [ ] `domains` uses **lowercase** (e.g., `"economics"` not `"Economics"`) - see [DOMAINS.md](firstdata/schemas/DOMAINS.md)
- [ ] `tags` include both English and Chinese keywords where relevant
- [ ] `id` does not already exist in `firstdata/indexes/all-sources.json`
- [ ] File path matches the placement rules above
- [ ] All URLs have been verified to be accessible and correct
- [ ] `update_frequency` reflects the actual cadence confirmed on the official site
- [ ] `authority_level` is accurate and not overstated
- [ ] Run `make check` to validate all checks pass
