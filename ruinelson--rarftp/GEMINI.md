# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

`rarftp` streams the contents of a RAR, ZIP, 7z or tar archive to an FTP server without extracting to disk (C++17, CMake). See `README.md` for options and behaviour. `rarftp-gui` is a desktop front-end for the same engine (Tauri 2 + vanilla HTML/CSS/JS in `gui/`) that talks to it through the `rarftpcore` shared library.

## Build and test

UnRAR sources are **not in the repo** (license) and must exist in `unrarsrc/` (gitignored) or CMake fails at configure time; the exact `curl` + `tar` commands are in `README.md`.

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release   # add -DRARFTP_BUNDLED_CURL=ON to build FTP-only libcurl from source (what CI does)
                                                           # add -DRARFTP_BUILD_LIBRARY=ON for the shared library the GUI links
cmake --build build                                        # produces build/rarftp (and build/librarftpcore.{dylib,so} / rarftpcore.dll)
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure                 # unit tests (doctest); with the library also the C API smoke test (tests/test_capi.cpp)
build/tests/rarftp_tests -tc="*pipe*"                      # single unit test case, doctest filter
python3 tests/integration/run.py --rarftp build/rarftp --rar /path/to/rar [--7z /path/to/7zz] [-k NAME] [--big] [--lib build/librarftpcore.dylib]   # e2e
cd gui && cargo tauri build                                # GUI bundle (macOS: gui/src-tauri/target/release/bundle/macos/rarftp-gui.app); `cargo tauri dev` runs it
cargo test --manifest-path gui/src-tauri/Cargo.toml        # Rust tests (memory file, FFI wrapper)
```

- Integration tests need Docker (vsftpd via `delfer/alpine-ftp-server`), RARLAB's `rar`, and Python 3.9+ stdlib only (ZIP fixtures come from `zipfile`; the Zstandard one needs 3.14+). 7-Zip (`7zz`, for 7z, AES/split/Deflate64 ZIP) and Info-ZIP `zip` are optional: tests whose archive could not be made are skipped (`env.require`). `-k` filters tests by name substring. Active-mode tests only work on Linux. `--lib` adds the `lib_*` tests (`-k lib_`), which drive the C API with `ctypes` and check the JSON contract at every poll; they are skipped without it.
- The GUI build needs Rust, `cargo install tauri-cli --version "^2" --locked` and the library already built: `gui/src-tauri/build.rs` looks for it in `build/` (or `RARFTP_LIB_DIR`) and fails with the CMake command otherwise. The bundle configs (`tauri.macos.conf.json`, `tauri.linux.conf.json`; Windows has none, it is built with `--no-bundle`) hard-code `../../build/...` (the macOS one is read even without bundling); with another `RARFTP_LIB_DIR` override them with `cargo tauri build --config '<json>'` (the CLI exports it to the build script as `TAURI_CONFIG`; setting `TAURI_CONFIG` by hand reaches only the build script, not the bundler).
- Formatting: `.clang-format` (Google style, 115 columns, left pointer alignment). Warnings are strict (`-Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic -Wshadow -Wconversion`; `/W4` on MSVC).
- Dependencies (fmt, CLI11, FTXUI, doctest, optionally curl) are fetched by `FetchContent` with pinned URL + SHA-256 in `cmake/Dependencies.cmake`; bump the hash together with the version. UnRAR is built from `unrarsrc/` by `cmake/UnRAR.cmake` as a static library using the DLL API (`RAR_TEST` mode). libarchive and its dependencies (zlib with prefixed symbols, bzip2 via our `cmake/bzip2/CMakeLists.txt`, xz, zstd, lz4, mbed TLS on Linux only) are `ExternalProject`s in `cmake/LibArchive.cmake` (libarchive's configure links test programs against them, so FetchContent cannot work), always Release, installed into `build/archive-deps`, toolchain settings forwarded through `build/archive-deps-cache.cmake`; the imported target is `rarftp::libarchive`, whose system libs (iconv on macOS, bcrypt on Windows) are listed by hand. Rust crates are pinned by `gui/src-tauri/Cargo.lock`; new ones must be added to `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`.

## Architecture

`rarftp_core` (static library) is the engine only: archive reading, plan, FTP, transfer pipeline, progress/log, JSON and text helpers. It has no CLI11/FTXUI. It is linked into the `rarftp` executable (`src/main.cpp`, `options.cpp`, `ui_plain.cpp`, `ui_tui.cpp`: the only code using CLI11 and FTXUI), into `tests/`, and into the `rarftpcore` shared library (only with `RARFTP_BUILD_LIBRARY`).

Pipeline (`src/transfer.cpp`), two threads joined by a bounded `Pipe` (`src/pipe.hpp`):

1. **Extractor thread**: an `Archive` (`src/archive.hpp`) decompresses and verifies each entry in memory and feeds `on_data`, which pushes `PipeMessage`s (`EnsureDir`, `FileBegin`, `Data`, `FileEnd`, `End`).
2. **Uploader thread**: pops messages and streams `Data` to a single libcurl FTP `STOR` on one control connection (`src/ftp_client.cpp`).

Key invariants:
- The `Pipe` capacity counts only `Data` bytes; that is what couples decompression speed to upload speed (`--buffer`, default 64 MiB). Oversized messages are accepted when the queue is empty.
- A file counts as uploaded only after the extractor reports `FileEnd` with `ok` (checksum verified). On any error the pipeline is **fail-fast**: both threads stop and the partial remote file is deleted.
- Cancellation (`Transfer::cancel`) is thread-safe and callable from the UI thread or the signal watcher.

Archives: `open_archive()` (`src/archive.cpp`) picks the backend by content, not extension, and has no signatures of its own: `libarchive_format()` asks libarchive's own detection (bidding), opening the parts with one format reader at a time (ZIP, 7z, tar) → `LibArchiveReader` (`src/libarchive_reader.cpp`, seekable ZIP reader, split `.001` parts opened together with `archive_read_open_filenames`); the tar probe includes libarchive's gzip/bzip2/xz/lzma/zstd/lz4 filters (registered only if `ARCHIVE_OK`: `ARCHIVE_WARN` means libarchive would run an external program); anything else → `RarArchive` (`src/rar_archive.cpp`, UnRAR, which also handles SFX). Both throw `ArchiveError` with a `Kind` (`MissingPassword`, `BadPassword`, `Other`) instead of returning codes. libarchive specifics: every call runs under a thread-local UTF-8 locale (`Utf8Locale`: `uselocale` on POSIX, per-thread CRT locale `.UTF8` on Windows); data-read warnings are failures (7z reports a bad CRC as `ARCHIVE_WARN`); the passphrase callback answers once per archive object (libarchive keeps asking after a wrong one); in `List` mode the first encrypted ZIP entry is partly read so a wrong password fails the listing (GUI re-prompt); names without a declared charset (unflagged ZIP, tar without pax) come as raw bytes on every OS (`compat-2x` format option) and are read as UTF-8 if valid, else CP437 (ZIP) or Latin-1 (tar); names are NFC (`to_nfc` on macOS, where libarchive gives NFD); 7z with a password is rejected; tar has `ArchiveFlags::checksums = false` (no data checksum: `list_archive` warns), and sparse holes are filled from the block offsets (the EOF offset is the real size). `ArchiveFlags::skip_decompresses` (solid RAR, every 7z, compressed tar) makes `Transfer` skip already-uploaded files with `test()` + discard.

Streamed archives (`ArchiveFlags::stream_only`: compressed tar, decompressed only once): `list_archive` only opens it (no entries), `build_plan` returns an empty plan with `streamed`, and the probe phase is skipped. `Transfer::extract_streamed` plans each entry with `Planner` (shared with `build_plan`) into a `std::deque` (references stay valid), and the uploader asks `RemoteProbe` (shared with `probe_remote`: one directory check + listing per directory, then SIZE) before each file; a file already there is drained with `discard_file()`. `Progress` starts with `totals_known = false` (totals grow as the uploader decides; `End` makes them known) and tracks `archive_read`/`archive_size` (`Archive::bytes_read()` = `archive_filter_bytes(-1)`), from which the UIs and the JSON derive the archive-level percentage and ETA. Skipped/ignored counts live in `TransferResult` (summary_lines takes only the result).

Before transfer (`main.cpp` orchestration, repeated by `Job` in `src/capi/job.cpp`): `list_archive` reads all headers of all volumes → `plan.cpp` sanitizes names (UnRAR-style: no `..`, absolute paths or control chars), detects duplicates/case collisions, ignores links, and builds a `TransferPlan` → `probe_remote` marks files already on the server with the same size as `Skip` (this is what makes re-runs resumable at file granularity).

CLI UI: `ui.hpp` declares two front-ends, `run_tui` (FTXUI full-screen, `ui_tui.cpp`) and `run_plain` (`ui_plain.cpp`, for `--no-tui` or non-terminals). Both observe `Progress` (thread-safe counters/speeds/ETAs) and `Logger` (log lines plus a bounded list of warnings/errors reprinted in the final summary). `summary.cpp` builds the final summary lines shared with the GUI. Platform/text helpers live in `src/util/`.

Exit codes: `0` ok, `1` error, `2` usage, `130` cancelled.

### Shared library and GUI

- `rarftpcore` (`src/capi/`): C API in `rarftp.h` (`rarftp_job_start/poll/answer_password/cancel/free`, `rarftp_version`, `rarftp_free`). `Job` (`job.cpp`) runs what `main.cpp` does (list archive → FTP login and destination check → plan and probe → `Transfer`) on its own controller thread, with GUI wording in its messages (no `--mkdir` etc.), and `poll()` returns the whole state as JSON (`src/util/json.hpp`): every key always present, `null` when not applicable, log lines numbered with a cursor (last 5000 kept). Only `rarftp_*` is exported (`-exported_symbol`, ELF version script, `dllexport`); UnRAR, libarchive (and its libraries), libcurl and fmt are static inside it.
- GUI backend (`gui/src-tauri`, Rust): `ffi.rs` (bindings + safe `Job` wrapper), `memory.rs` (Memory Save/Recall/Clear in `~/.config/rarftp-gui/memory.ini`, plain text, the archive password is never stored), `lib.rs` (Tauri commands: `start_transfer`, `poll_transfer`, `answer_password`, `cancel_transfer`, `close_transfer`, `memory_*`, `app_info`; one job at a time, dropped on exit). `build.rs` links the library and sets rpaths.
- GUI frontend (`gui/ui`, vanilla JS, no npm, `withGlobalTauri`): polls `poll_transfer` every ~200 ms and renders the JSON (`archive.format` is "RAR", "ZIP", "7z" or "tar", `archive.compression` null or the tar compression, `archive.files/bytes/bytes_text` null for a streamed archive; `progress.totals_known`, `archive_read`, `archive_size`; the prompt kind is `archive_password`). `tests/test_capi.cpp` and the `lib_*` integration tests check the same JSON, so change it in all three places. ZIP/7z/tar test archives for the C++ tests are byte arrays in `tests/archive_fixtures.hpp`.

More invariants:
- `--archive-password` (CLI) / `archive_password` (C API, GUI) is the archive password; `--rar-password` is a hidden alias (both together is a usage error).
- `PasswordSource` takes a prompt function (terminal in the CLI, GUI dialog in `Job`) and asks at most once per instance. `Job::read_archive` builds a new one and re-asks on `ArchivePasswordError` (prompt error `Wrong password`), and calls `disable_prompt()` before the transfer threads start.
- `FtpClient::set_cancel_check` lets `Job::cancel` interrupt a server that does not answer; `FtpConfig::mention_flags = false` keeps CLI options out of FTP error hints.
- `poll()` copies the log while holding the state lock, so a snapshot saying `finished` already has every log line.
- The CLI must never link the shared library (UnRAR and libarchive stay static in `rarftp`). `src/version.hpp` must not exist: it would shadow UnRAR's `version.hpp`, included as `<version.hpp>` by `rar_archive.cpp`; hence `app_version.hpp`.

## CI

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` builds Linux/macOS/Windows with bundled static libcurl, downloads UnRAR sources (pinned SHA-256), runs the unit tests only (the Docker integration tests are local-only), and publishes a `.rar` per platform as an artifact (RARLAB's `rar` is used only to create those archives). A `gui` job builds `rarftpcore` (bundled curl, its `capi` test), runs `cargo test` and builds the GUI: AppImage (Linux x64/arm64, checks the library resolves inside it), universal `.app` (macOS, ad-hoc signed), `rarftp-gui.exe` + `rarftpcore.dll` with static CRTs (Windows, `--no-bundle`); the `package` job makes `rarftp-gui-<platform>.rar` too.

## Releases

Use the CI-generated artifacts to get the RAR files for binary distribution.

The macOS artifacts must be signed with the maintainer's Developer ID and notarized before they are published (CI only signs ad hoc); the Linux and Windows ones are uploaded as CI made them. Steps:

1. Tag `vX.X.X` on `main`, wait for the CI run on the tag, and `gh run download` its 8 `.rar` artifacts.
2. Extract `rarftp-macos-universal.rar` and `rarftp-gui-macos-universal.rar` (with RARLAB's `rar`).
3. Sign with `codesign --force --options runtime --timestamp --sign "<Developer ID Application identity>"`: the CLI binary with `--identifier io.github.ruinelson.rarftp`; for the app, `Contents/Frameworks/librarftpcore.dylib` first, then `rarftp-gui.app` (no entitlements needed).
4. Notarize: `ditto -c -k` each into a zip (`--keepParent` for the `.app`), then `xcrun notarytool submit <zip> --keychain-profile <notary profile> --wait`.
5. `xcrun stapler staple rarftp-gui.app` (a bare CLI binary cannot be stapled). Check with `spctl -a -vv` (the CLI with `-t open --context context:primary-signature`).
6. Repack each with `rar a -r -m5 -ma5` (same file names and contents as the CI archives, `LICENSE`, `README.md` and `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` included).
7. `gh release create vX.X.X --title "Version X.X.X"` with the 6 Linux/Windows archives from CI and the 2 signed macOS ones.

The project uses semantic versioning, tag the repository (`vX.X.X`), the GitHub version name follows the format `Version X.X.X`

Release notes format is a list of what's new for the user (do not include changes not relevant to the end user such as documentation, CI, etc.), ordered by significance.
