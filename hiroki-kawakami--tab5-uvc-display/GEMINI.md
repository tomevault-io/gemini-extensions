# Tab5-UVC-Display — Claude notes

ESP32-P4 (M5Stack Tab5) project that pulls 1280×720 MJPEG from a USB UVC camera,
hardware-decodes it, and displays it rotated 90° on a 720×1280 MIPI-DSI panel.

## Build / flash / monitor

The dev environment lives in a Nix flake; **always use `nix develop`** instead
of sourcing `export.sh` directly:

```sh
nix develop --command idf.py -C esp32p4 build
nix develop --command idf.py -C esp32p4 flash monitor   # needs a TTY
```

When `idf.py monitor` can't attach (no TTY in non-interactive shell), drive
the serial directly with PySerial:

```sh
nix develop --command python3 -u -c "
import subprocess, serial, time, sys
subprocess.run(['python', '-m', 'esptool', '--chip', 'esp32p4', '-p',
    '/dev/cu.usbmodem114201', '-b', '460800', '--before=default_reset',
    '--after=hard_reset', 'write_flash', '--flash_mode', 'dio',
    '--flash_freq', '80m', '--flash_size', '16MB',
    '0x10000', 'esp32p4/build/tab5-uvc-display.bin'])
ser = serial.Serial('/dev/cu.usbmodem114201', 115200, timeout=0.2)
end = time.time() + 15
while time.time() < end:
    data = ser.read(4096)
    if data: sys.stdout.write(data.decode('utf-8', errors='replace')); sys.stdout.flush()
"
```

Note: the second `/dev/cu.usbmodem*` enumerator is the JTAG/console port we
flash on; the first one is busy if the user already has a monitor open.
**ESP32-P4 only prints logs once after reset** — capture during the boot
sequence, don't expect output later.

ESP-IDF v5.4.3 lives at `/nix/store/1jf3iqwyp77i8y54cgn6qxbrwl3wx5mz-esp-idf-v5.4.3/`.

## Layout

- `app/` — `PreviewScreen` (UVC frame → pipeline → display), `uvc_display.cpp`.
- `components/{lvgl++,screen_manager}/` — shared UI helpers.
- `idf-components/main/` — IDF entry (`main.cpp`), `platform_port_*` adapters
  for JPEG/PPA, USB host wrappers. **No explicit `REQUIRES`** — the absence
  is intentional so that the implicit "all-components-available" mode stays
  on; adding `REQUIRES`/`PRIV_REQUIRES` here breaks transitive header lookup
  (e.g. `bsp_tab5.h`, `esp_timer.h`).
- `idf-components/m5tab5-bsp/` — vendored BSP for the panel + touch +
  audio. `inc/audio_eq.h` + `src/audio_eq.c` is the cascaded-biquad EQ /
  software fader / mono-mix DSP block that sits inside
  `bsp_tab5_audio_write` (see the audio section below).
- `idf-components/jpeg_decode_enhanced/` — reusable strip-pipelined JPEG
  decode (+ optional PPA) component, all C. Full documentation (usage,
  config reference, tuning, 2D-DMA internals) lives in its `README.md`.
  Two layers:
  - `jpeg_decode_enhanced.h` — Layer 1: strip decoder
    (`jpeg_enh_strip_decoder_*`) + whole-frame convenience decode
    (`jpeg_enh_decoder_process`). PPA-free; full-range YUV→RGB capable.
  - `jpeg_ppa_pipeline.h` — Layer 2: `jpeg_ppa_pipeline_*`, drives Layer 1
    strips through PPA SRM with a per-frame transform (rotation / scale /
    mirror / crop / output offset).
  Bypasses IDF's `jpeg_decoder_process()` by reaching into ESP-IDF private
  headers; do **not** override `esp_driver_jpeg` (the user explicitly rejected
  that approach). The component's CMakeLists adds private include paths via
  `target_include_directories(... PRIVATE $ENV{IDF_PATH}/components/esp_driver_jpeg{,/private})`,
  and `jpeg_decode_enhanced.c` has an `ESP_IDF_VERSION` guard (validated on
  v5.4.x only) because it touches `jpeg_private.h` struct layout.

`esp32p4/CMakeLists.txt` wires both `components/` and `idf-components/` via
`EXTRA_COMPONENT_DIRS`. The `main` component's CMake also globs `app/` and
`components/*/` into the main source list.

## jpeg_decode_enhanced — design summary

Why it exists: JPEG-codec alone can do 60fps@1280×720; with the stock
`jpeg_decoder_process` → PSRAM → PPA SRM → PSRAM-FB chain, PSRAM bandwidth
caps throughput at ~20fps. Decoding into a ring of **internal SRAM** strip
buffers and feeding each strip through PPA SRM in parallel removes the
PSRAM-read leg and brings the system back to camera-saturating 30fps.
(`strip_alloc_caps = MALLOC_CAP_SPIRAM` keeps the ring in PSRAM instead —
slower, but useful when the goal is just a small intermediate buffer; the
component handles the cache purge at alloc time and CPU consumers must call
`jpeg_enh_strip_decoder_sync_strip_for_cpu` before reading a strip.)

Frame geometry is re-derived from the JPEG header every frame: any size up
to `max_pic_w/max_pic_h` decodes without reconfiguration, `strip_h_hint` is
rounded to the frame's MCU height, the final strip may be shorter, and
non-MCU-aligned image heights are decoded padded then cropped by the PPA
stage (strip events carry `rows` = valid vs `padded_rows`). The only hard
constraint left is hardware: strip boundaries sit on MCU-row boundaries
because the 2D-DMA RX reorder works in JPEG-sampling-sized macro blocks and
one MCU row cannot span two descriptors.

`yuv_full_range` (Layer 1 cfg / pipeline cfg) switches the decode CSC from
IDF's stock limited-range matrix to the JFIF full-range one (BT601 and BT709
tables both provided). Default **false** = IDF-compatible limited range;
the Tab5 app sets **true** — forgetting it washes out blacks.

Key implementation decisions that were learned the hard way:

1. **Owner-bit backpressure does NOT work for JPEG-RX.** Setting `owner=CPU`
   on a descriptor with `in_check_owner_chn=1` raises `RX_DSCR_ERROR` and
   ends the transaction; it does not pause. (See `dma2d_struct.h`,
   `in_dscr_err_chn_int_raw` doc: "including owner error".)
2. **End-of-chain (`next=NULL`) raises `IN_DSCR_EMPTY` and ends the
   transaction** — also not a pause mechanism.
3. The only viable backpressure is **dynamic chain extension via
   `dma2d_append()`**: pre-link only `ring_count` descriptors with the last
   one's `.next=NULL`, and splice in descriptor `i + ring_count` only after
   PPA finishes strip `i`. `release_strip()` does the splice + cache-msync
   + `dma2d_append`. The DMA never sees a CPU-owned descriptor and never
   reaches the chain end as long as `PPA-strip-time < (ring_count - 1) ×
   JPEG-strip-time`.
4. **`suc_eof=0` on every descriptor**. The JPEG↔DMA bridge fires `SUC_EOF`
   off the JPEG hardware's frame-done signal, not off the descriptor's eof
   bit. Setting `suc_eof=1` somewhere in the chain causes a spurious EOF and
   triggers the `dma2d_ll_rx_is_fsm_idle` assert in the dma2d ISR.
5. The `on_recv_eof` callback must **post `JPEG_DMA2D_RX_EOF` into the
   engine's `evt_queue`** to unblock our wait loop (mirroring IDF's
   `jpeg_rx_eof`); just releasing the semaphore wasn't enough and led to
   `decode timeout` errors.
6. `on_desc_done` does **not** populate `event_data->rx_eof_desc_addr` (only
   `on_recv_eof` does). Track strip index with a counter, not by inspecting
   the descriptor address from the event.
7. **Do not register `on_desc_empty`.** Registering it newly enables the
   DESC_EMPTY interrupt, which the dma2d ISR handles by freeing the pooled
   channels (plus an FSM-idle assert) — and whether the raw bit also raises
   at a *normal* frame end is unverified, so enabling it risks breaking
   every frame. A mid-frame ring underrun is instead diagnosed at decode
   timeout from the signature `isr_next_strip == chain_tail + 1` (DMA
   consumed every linked descriptor and stalled at the unspliced one).
8. `release_strip()` splices/appends under a spinlock gated by
   `frame_active`; the gate closes before `dma2d_force_end` on error paths
   so a late release can't poke a freed (possibly reassigned) DMA channel.
   On clean frames the gate is provably irrelevant: EOF implies every
   mid-frame splice already happened, and post-EOF releases are no-ops
   (`strip_idx + ring_count >= strip_count`).

## Tuning (preview_screen.cpp)

```cpp
constexpr int STRIP_H = 16;       // strip_h_hint; rounded to mcu_y per frame
constexpr int RING_COUNT = 5;     // SRAM ring depth
```

Constraints to satisfy:

- `STRIP_H` is a hint: the pipeline rounds it down to the frame's `mcu_y`
  (8 for the YUV422 this camera emits, 16 for YUV420). Keeping it a
  multiple of 16 also guarantees the per-strip scale placement check passes
  for any scale factor (16 × any 1/16-quantized scale is an integer).
- `RING_COUNT * STRIP_H * pic_w * bytes_per_pixel < ~300 KiB` of available
  `MALLOC_CAP_INTERNAL`. After IDF + USB + LVGL + FreeRTOS overhead, the
  largest free SRAM region is the 384 KiB pool at `0x4FF40000` (boot log
  `heap_init: At 4FF40000 len 00060000 (384 KiB): RAM`).
- `RING_COUNT - 1 ≥ PPA-strip-time / JPEG-strip-time`. With STRIP_H=16,
  ring=5 has worked in practice for both RGB565 and RGB888 intermediates at
  30fps.
- **Smaller STRIP_H is not free.** Halving STRIP_H doubles the per-frame
  PPA `ppa_do_scale_rotate_mirror` call count; the per-call validation +
  cache-msync overhead drops total throughput (observed 30fps → 24fps
  going from STRIP_H=16 to STRIP_H=8 with RGB888).

## Output-FB strip placement

`s_strip_out_rect` (jpeg_ppa_pipeline.c) maps each strip's crop-relative,
scaled row band `[A, B)` into the output through rotate → mirror → offset.
Pre-mirror placement (empirically matches PPA hardware; strip 0 = image
top):

| rotation | rect (x, y, w, h) |
|---|---|
| 0   | (0, A, scaled_w, B−A)            |
| 90  | (A, 0, B−A, scaled_w)            |
| 180 | (0, scaled_h−B, scaled_w, B−A)   |
| 270 | (scaled_h−B, 0, B−A, scaled_w)   |

If output looks mirrored, swap the 90/270 formulas. `mirror_x/_y` flip the
rect across the scaled-rotated extent (PPA mirrors the pixels inside each
block; the placement flip completes the global mirror) — **assumed
output-space mirror semantics, not yet verified on hardware** since the Tab5
app doesn't use mirror.

Because every strip is an independent PPA block, each interior strip
boundary must scale to a whole output row; `s_on_frame_start` validates
`(boundary_rel × scale_y_sixteenths) % 16 == 0` per frame and rejects the
transform otherwise.

## Camera (UVC) notes

- Camera advertises `1280x720@30fps`. Asking for 60fps fails with
  `Could not find frame format 1280x720@60.0FPS`.
- The JPEG stream from this camera is **YUV422** (`mcu_y=8`), NOT YUV420.
  YUV420 SRM input (which could halve intermediate strip size) is therefore
  not directly usable — JPEG hardware can't transcode 422→420. Use RGB565
  or RGB888 intermediate instead.

## Audio (ES8388 speaker + UAC RX)

Tab5 has an ES8388 codec driving the on-board speaker. The
`idf-components/m5tab5-bsp/devices/es8388/` wrapper sets up
`I2S0 std mode TX` (mclk=30, bclk=27, ws=29, dout=26, din=28, 48kHz/16bit
stereo by default) plus `esp_codec_dev` in DAC mode. The speaker amp gate
(`PI4IOE1.SPK_EN`, bit 1) is driven by the speaker-mode policy described
below — **not** raised at pi4io init time. After init the codec is pinned
at max output (`es8388_set_volume(es8388, 100)`); user-facing volume is
delivered by the software fader in `audio_eq` instead of the codec's
volume register. Only the TX path is wired up — RX TDM (mic capture) can
be added later if needed.

Public API surface (`bsp_tab5.h`):
- `bsp_tab5_audio_{open,close,reconfig,write,set_volume,set_mute,get_volume}`
- `bsp_tab5_audio_eq_{set_enabled,is_enabled,set_biquads,handle}` — runtime EQ control
- `bsp_tab5_audio_{set,get}_speaker_mode` + `bsp_tab5_audio_headphone_inserted`
- `bsp_tab5_audio_set_headphone_callback(cb, user)` — fired on HP plug/unplug
- `bsp_tab5_audio_{set,get}_mono_mix` — stereo→mono downmix for L-only speaker

```

Key implementation decisions:

1. **Decouple RX_DONE from the codec write via a StreamBuffer + dedicated
   consumer task.** If `esp_codec_dev_write` blocks on I2S DMA inside the
   RX_DONE callback, the UAC driver task can't service the next RX_DONE
   and the UAC ring buffer overruns — audible as periodic dropouts. Splitting
   the two means I2S blocking only stalls the consumer, never the UAC
   driver task.
2. **Non-blocking push, drop on overflow.** `xStreamBufferSend` uses
   `timeout=0`; if the buffer is full we drop the tail of the current chunk.
   Back-pressuring into UAC's internal ring would lose samples *anyway* and
   accumulate drift, so a brief audible glitch is preferable.
3. **Consumer pinned to core 1, priority 10.** UVC frame callbacks +
   JPEG/PPA renderer are on core 0; keeping audio on core 1 avoids
   contention with the 30fps render loop. Priority 10 > UAC driver (5) so
   the buffer drains promptly once data lands, but < renderer (16) so we
   never starve video.
4. **Catmull–Rom cubic Hermite resampler in the consumer with
   stream-buffer-fill feedback (drift correction).** Each iteration reads
   the StreamBuffer bytes still queued *after* the receive, computes
   `step = 1 + Kp·(fill_ratio − 0.5)` clamped to [0.99, 1.01], and
   resamples the chunk by `step` before handing it to the codec. The
   buffer fill is the only drift signal we have between the USB SOF and
   I2S MCLK clock domains (DMA-side "remaining" is mathematically the
   same signal, since `esp_codec_dev_write` blocks and keeps the DMA
   queue full by construction). Continuous fractional resampling avoids
   discrete sample insert/drop; the worst-case audible effect is a ±1%
   pitch shift that only exists transiently while the loop pulls fill
   back toward target. Catmull–Rom uses a sliding 4-sample window
   (3 history samples per channel kept across chunk boundaries via
   `hist_l[3]`/`hist_r[3]`) and Horner-evaluates a cubic that's exact at
   `t=0` and `t=1`; coefficients depend only on the window so we compute
   them once per input frame and reuse for all outputs that fall inside.
   Output must be saturated — cubic Hermite can overshoot the input
   range, unlike linear.
5. **Frame alignment is the consumer's job.** `xStreamBufferReceive` is
   byte-oriented and may return non-multiples of `FRAME_BYTES=4`. The
   consumer carries up to 3 leftover bytes between iterations so the
   resampler always sees whole stereo-16 frames. The byte stream is
   treated as 48 kHz stereo 16-bit regardless of how UAC labelled it
   (the MS2109 quirk — see below — funnels through the same path).

UAC device detection is driven by the `uac_host` driver callback in
`usb_host::UAC::driverEventCb`; the first `RX_CONNECTED` interface latches
its `(addr, iface_num)` and gives a semaphore. `openRx()` blocks on that
semaphore with a timeout, then allocates the PSRAM RX buffer + stream
buffer + consumer task before calling `uac_host_device_open`.

### MS2109 quirk (HDMI→USB capture, VID=0x534D PID=0x2109)

The device **descriptor-advertises 96 kHz mono 16-bit but actually streams
48 kHz stereo 16-bit on the wire** — same byte rate, mis-labelled format.
`PreviewScreen::onEnter` calls `uac_host_device_start(96000, 1, 16)`
(matching the lie in the descriptor) while leaving ES8388 open at
48000/2/16 (matching the real wire format). The bytes line up and stereo
plays correctly. **Do NOT** "fix" this by reconfiguring ES8388 to
96k/mono — that would honour the false descriptor and break playback.
Preserve the asymmetric configuration for any device matching that VID/PID.

### Clock-domain drift

USB SOF (UAC supply rate) and ES8388 I2S MCLK are independent clock
domains — typically a few hundred ppm apart, which would otherwise show
up on multi-minute streams as the StreamBuffer slowly filling
(→ tail-drop glitches) or emptying (→ DMA underrun, silent because of
`auto_clear_after_cb=true`).

The consumer task corrects for this with a software resampler driven by
the buffer-fill signal — see decision #4 above for the loop math. The
resampler bounds the correction to ±1% (`STEP_MIN=0.99`, `STEP_MAX=1.01`)
which is far above any realistic clock drift but well below audibility,
so steady-state behaviour is "buffer parks near half-full, pitch shift
is imperceptibly small". The `xStreamBufferSend` drop-on-overflow path in
`handleRxDone` is now strictly a backstop — if it ever fires in steady
state, either Kp is too small to track the drift or the loop is being
starved.

### Audio DSP block (`audio_eq` component)

`idf-components/m5tab5-bsp/{inc/audio_eq.h,src/audio_eq.c}` — a small DSP
block plumbed into `bsp_tab5_audio_write`. Three concerns share a single
per-buffer pass:

1. **Cascaded biquads.** RBJ "Audio EQ Cookbook" designers (`peaking`,
   `low_shelf`, `high_shelf`, `lowpass`, `highpass`) emit
   `audio_eq_biquad_t` structs that get copied into the chain via
   `audio_eq_set_biquads`. Direct-form II transposed, normalised to
   `a0=1`, up to `max_stages` (default 8). State is per-channel.
2. **Software gain with per-frame fade.** `audio_eq_set_gain(target,
   fade_ms)` updates the cursor; the per-frame loop interpolates
   `current_gain` toward `target_gain` over `fade_ms`. Volume control
   was moved off the ES8388 hardware volume register (which clicks on
   every step) onto this fader — the codec is pinned at `vol=100`
   forever after init.
3. **Stereo→mono downmix.** When enabled, the output of each frame is
   replaced by `(L+R)/2` on both channels. Tab5 only wires L into the
   speaker amp, so this is the only way R-side content reaches the
   speaker.

Pipeline order inside the loop: per-channel biquads → per-channel gain →
optional mono mix → saturate to int16. Gain comes **after** biquads so
changing it doesn't disturb the filter memory (= no transient on
volume slides). Mono mix is the last step so per-channel EQ still runs
on the original stereo image before being collapsed.

**Lock-snapshot pattern in `audio_eq_process`.** The mutex is taken only
to snapshot `{biquad coefficients, channels, gain cursor, fade params,
mono_mix flag}`, then the per-sample loop runs lock-free. State writeback
(advanced `current_gain` / `fade_remaining`) happens under another short
critical section that *only* writes back if `target_gain` hasn't been
touched meanwhile, so a concurrent `set_gain` from UI doesn't get
clobbered. Earlier the mutex was held across the whole ~1–2 ms loop and
rapid slider drags caused observable stalls on the LVGL/UVC paths on the
same core.

`audio_eq_set_biquads` resets filter state (the new coefficients have no
meaningful history), so swapping presets on HP plug doesn't produce a
zip click — the gain stage continues smoothly.

### Speaker amp gate + headphone detect

Tab5's speaker amp is gated by `PI4IOE1` pin 1 (`SPK_EN`), and the
3.5 mm jack's detect switch is on `PI4IOE1` pin 7 (`HP_DET`). HP_DET is
pulled up externally, the jack's NC switch shorts the line to GND when
no plug is inserted, so **`HP_DET=1` means headphones inserted**.

`bsp_speaker_mode_t` selects the policy applied to SPK_EN:

- `BSP_SPEAKER_MODE_ON` (= 0; default for zero-init configs)
- `BSP_SPEAKER_MODE_AUTO` — amp on only while HP is *not* inserted
- `BSP_SPEAKER_MODE_OFF`

A dedicated task `bsp_spk` (prio 1, stack 2 KiB) owns SPK_EN. The task
**is only spawned when needed** — i.e. when mode = AUTO or when an app
registered a HP callback. For OFF/ON modes with no callback, SPK_EN is
set once in `bsp_tab5_init` and we're done; no task overhead.

`bsp_tab5_audio_set_headphone_callback(cb, user)` registers a single
callback fired on every HP state change (~200 ms granularity from the
AUTO poll). The callback runs from the `bsp_spk` task — UI/LVGL work
must be bounced via `lv_async_call`. Registration captures the current
HP state into `s_hp_last`, so the callback never fires a "stale"
notification at registration time.

**Anti-pop init order** (this matters — the user notices each ms of
remaining click):

1. `pi4io_init` with SPK_EN initial value = **false** (amp stays off)
2. (display, touch, codec configuration — amp off the whole time)
3. `es8388_init` — codec configured, muted
4. `audio_eq_init` → `audio_eq_set_gain(0, 0)` (silent gain)
5. `es8388_set_volume(100)` — codec unmuted, but SPK_EN is still LOW so
   the unmute click never reaches the speaker
6. `vTaskDelay(50 ms)` — DAC analog stage settles
7. `apply_speaker_pin(s_speaker_mode)` — SPK_EN finally goes high with
   a silent, stable input

Steps 1–5 cleanly eliminate the codec-unmute pop. The amp's own
power-on transient at step 7 is the only remaining click source
(HW-level event, can't be suppressed entirely in software).

### Per-output audio policy (`preview_screen`)

Three things differ between speaker output and headphone output, all
switched together by the HP callback registered in `PreviewScreen::build`:

| | Speaker (`hp_connected_=false`) | Headphone (`hp_connected_=true`) |
|---|---|---|
| Volume | NVS key `"vol"` | NVS key `"hp_vol"` |
| EQ preset | `speaker_eq_stages()` | `headphone_eq_stages()` |
| Mono mix | ON, `(L+R)/2` | OFF (stereo) |
| Slider label | "Volume (Speaker)" | "Volume (Headphones)" |

`apply_active_volume`, `apply_active_eq`, `apply_active_mono_mix` are
the three "push current mode → BSP" helpers; the HP callback dispatches
all three through `lv_async_call`. The two EQ-stage arrays are
function-local `static const` arrays (the cookbook designers run once on
first call and the coefficients are cached for the lifetime of the
process).

Volume → gain curve: `gain_db = (vol-100) × 0.4` → −40 dB at vol=1,
0 dB at vol=100. `vol=0` is a hard zero (true silence). All transitions
fade over 100 ms (`BSP_VOLUME_FADE_MS`). `bsp_tab5_audio_set_volume`
short-circuits when the value hasn't changed so LVGL slider event
duplicates don't churn the fader.

Current speaker preset is **bass-only** (HPF 80 Hz + low-shelf +7 dB
@300 Hz + peaking +3 dB @150 Hz, mid/high left flat). The small 1 W /
8 Ω driver responded badly to mid/high EQ in all the variations we
tried — perceptually worse than no EQ — so we stopped fighting it. The
150 Hz peaking sits on top of the shelf to put extra punch near the
driver's Fs where it actually radiates efficiently; the shelf alone
wastes energy on the 50–100 Hz range the cone can't reproduce. The
HP preset is a leftover V-shape from earlier experiments and is the
right next thing to tune separately.

## Things to check before changing the pipeline

- `conv_std` (pipeline cfg) chooses BT601 vs BT709 for the YUV→RGB CSC done
  inside the JPEG decode 2D-DMA path; `yuv_full_range` switches the matrix
  to JFIF full range (the Tab5 app needs `true`).
- `strip_color_mode` is the **intermediate strip format**, not the JPEG
  input format. It controls both the JPEG codec output format
  (`s_jpeg_out_for_strip_cm`) and the PPA SRM input color mode. RGB565
  saves SRAM at the cost of color depth; RGB888 preserves precision.
- Strip buffers are sized with bit-depth math (`bits / 8` on the *total*),
  so YUV420 (12bpp → 1.5 B/px) sizes correctly; do not switch back to
  truncated `bytes_per_pixel` arithmetic.
- Transform parameters (rotation/scale/mirror/crop/out offset) are
  per-frame — only sizes, formats and ring memory are fixed at
  `jpeg_ppa_pipeline_new` time.

## Risk / unfinished

- Ring underrun (PPA falling more than `RING_COUNT-1` strips behind) ends
  the DMA transaction and surfaces as `ESP_ERR_TIMEOUT` ~200 ms later with
  a "strip ring underrun" log (diagnosed from chain bookkeeping at timeout;
  the DESC_EMPTY interrupt is deliberately left disabled — see design
  summary #7). Detection is post-hoc, not preventive.
- `mirror_x/_y` placement math assumes PPA mirrors in output space; not yet
  verified on hardware (unused by the Tab5 app).
- The whole-frame `jpeg_enh_decoder_process` path and PSRAM strip rings
  (`strip_alloc_caps = MALLOC_CAP_SPIRAM`) are implemented per the design
  but have no in-tree user yet, so they're untested on hardware.
