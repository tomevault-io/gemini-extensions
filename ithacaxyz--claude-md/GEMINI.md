# Claude Code Agent Guide for Ithaca Team

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for Claude Code agents working with team members on development projects. It synthesizes best practices, workflows, and critical guidelines to ensure effective and safe code contributions.

## Directory Structure and Purpose

Your projects directory contains various git repositories for reference and development. Each subdirectory is typically an independent git repository used for finding code examples, implementations, and reference material.

**CRITICAL**: Reference repositories are for REFERENCE ONLY. Do not modify git configurations or remotes in these repositories.

## Essential Workflow Rules

### 1. Working Directory Guidelines

- **Read/explore**: Your main projects directory (reference repositories)
- **Modify/experiment**: A dedicated workspace directory for isolated changes

**ALWAYS check if a repository is already cloned locally before attempting to fetch from the web!** Use `ls` or check the directory structure to see if the project you need is already present before cloning it for reference.

### 2. Code Modification Workflow

When working on code changes:

1. **Always work in a dedicated workspace directory**
2. **Use git worktrees** for creating isolated workspaces from existing repos
3. **Only use git clone if the repository doesn't exist locally**
4. **NEVER modify the remotes of existing reference repositories**

#### Git Worktree Workflow (Preferred)

Git worktrees allow multiple working directories from a single repository, perfect for parallel work:

```bash
# First, check if the repo exists in your workspace
cd ~/projects  # or your designated workspace directory
ls -la | grep REPO_NAME

# If repo exists, create a worktree
cd ~/projects/REPO_NAME
git worktree add ../REPO_NAME-FEATURE-PURPOSE -b feature-branch

# If repo doesn't exist, clone it first (check for your fork)
gh repo view YOUR_USERNAME/REPO_NAME --web 2>/dev/null || echo "No fork found"

# Clone from your fork if it exists
git clone git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git REPO_NAME
cd REPO_NAME
git remote add upstream git@github.com:ORIGINAL_ORG/REPO_NAME.git

# Or clone from original if no fork
git clone git@github.com:ORIGINAL_ORG/REPO_NAME.git REPO_NAME
```

#### Worktree Management

```bash
# List all worktrees for a repo
git worktree list

# Create a new worktree for a feature
git worktree add ../repo-optimization -b optimize-feature

# Remove a worktree when done
git worktree remove ../repo-optimization

# Clean up worktree references
git worktree prune
```

Use descriptive worktree names that indicate purpose:
- `reth-cpu-optimization`
- `repo-name-issue-123`
- `project-feature-description`

**Benefits of worktrees**:
- Share the same git history and objects (saves disk space)
- Switch between features instantly without stashing
- Keep multiple experiments running in parallel
- Easier cleanup - just remove the worktree directory

#### Workspace Maintenance

**Clean up build artifacts** when disk space is needed:
```bash
# For Rust projects
cd ~/projects/repo-name
cargo clean

# Check space used by all target directories
du -sh ~/projects/*/target

# Clean all Rust projects in workspaces - only run this if you are sure you want to clean all workspaces and/or have already run out of space
find ~/projects -name "Cargo.toml" -exec dirname {} \; | xargs -I {} sh -c 'cd {} && cargo clean'
```

**When to clean up workspaces**:
- After PR has been merged
- When changes have been abandoned
- Before removing a worktree

```bash
# Clean and remove a worktree
cd ~/projects/repo-name
git worktree remove ../repo-optimization
```

### 3. Git Workflow

When working on code:

1. Create feature branches for your work
2. Commit changes with clear messages
3. Use descriptive branch names: `name/fix-something`, `name/add-feature`, `name/make-clippy-happy-123456`

### 4. GitHub CLI (gh) Usage

The `gh` CLI tool is available for exploring GitHub repositories and understanding code context.

#### Allowed Operations

```bash
# Repository exploration
gh repo view owner/repo
gh repo clone owner/repo  # For initial clones

# Issues and PRs
gh issue list --repo owner/repo
gh issue view 123 --repo owner/repo
gh pr list --repo owner/repo
gh pr view 456 --repo owner/repo
gh pr diff 456 --repo owner/repo
gh pr checkout 456  # To examine PR branches locally

# API queries
gh api repos/owner/repo/pulls/123/comments
gh api repos/owner/repo/issues/123/comments

# Search operations
gh search issues "query" --repo owner/repo
gh search prs "query" --repo owner/repo

# Status and authentication
gh auth status
gh status

# Releases and workflows (read-only)
gh release list --repo owner/repo
gh release view v1.0.0 --repo owner/repo
gh workflow list --repo owner/repo
gh run list --workflow=ci.yml --repo owner/repo
```

#### Common Use Cases

1. **Examining PR discussions**:
   ```bash
   gh pr view 123 --comments
   gh api repos/paradigmxyz/reth/pulls/123/comments | jq '.[].body'
   ```

2. **Finding related issues**:
   ```bash
   gh search issues "optimization" --repo paradigmxyz/reth --state open
   ```

3. **Checking PR changes**:
   ```bash
   gh pr diff 456 --repo owner/repo
   ```

## Task-Specific Guidelines

### Performance Optimization

#### Key Performance Principles

1. **Always use existing benchmark infrastructure**
   ```bash
   # Check existing benchmarks
   ls benches/
   cargo bench --workspace 'operation_name'
   ```

2. **Never create standalone benchmark files** - use the project's build system (such as `cargo`) and create benchmarks runnable with `cargo bench`.

3. **Proper benchmarking workflow**:
   ```bash
   # Start from main
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   
   # Run baseline benchmarks
   cargo bench --workspace 'operation_name' -- --save-baseline feature-baseline
   
   # Create optimization branch
   git checkout -b optimize-operation-description
   
   # Implement changes and benchmark
   cargo bench --workspace 'operation_name' -- --baseline feature-baseline
   ```

4. **Draw inspiration from reference projects**:
   - For arithmetic: `nethermind/`, `int256/`, `go-ethereum/`, `crypto-bigint/`, `gmp/`
   - For Ethereum nodes: `go-ethereum/`, `nethermind/`, `erigon/`, `lighthouse/`
   - For Rust patterns: `rust/`, `tokio/`, `hyper/`

5. **Measure performance changes**, then understand the impact:
   - Use `cargo bench` to run benchmarks
   - Compare results before and after changes
   - Reflect on the impact based on understanding of the new code
   - Repeat the process until satisfied with the results

### Writing Code

1. **Follow existing patterns** - Study how the project structures similar code
2. **Check dependencies first** - Never assume a library is available
3. **Maintain consistency** - Use the project's naming conventions and style
4. **Security first** - Never expose secrets or keys in code

### Commit Message Best Practices

Writing excellent commit messages is crucial - they become the permanent record of why changes were made.

#### Commit Title Format

Use semantic commit format with a clear, specific title:
- `feat:` - New features
- `fix:` - Bug fixes  
- `perf:` - Performance improvements
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks
- `docs:` - Documentation
- `test:` - Test changes
- `refactor:` - Code restructuring

**Title guidelines**:
- Be specific: `perf: add specialized multiplication for 8 limbs` not `perf: optimize mul`
- Use imperative mood: "add" not "adds" or "added"
- Keep under 50 characters when possible
- Don't end with a period

#### Commit Description (Body)

The commit body is where you provide context and details about a specific commit. **This is different from PR descriptions**. Many commits do not have
descriptions.

**When to add a body**:
- Breaking changes (note the impact)
- Non-obvious changes (explain why, not what)
- When a commit is very complex or cannot be split up, and is not the only distinct change in the branch or PR

**Format**:
```
<title line>
<blank line>
<body>
<blank line>
<footer>
```

#### Examples

**Performance improvement** (body required):
```
perf: add specialized multiplication for 8 limbs

Benchmarks show ~2.7x speedup for 512-bit operations:
- Before: ~41ns
- After: ~15ns

This follows the existing pattern of specialized implementations
for sizes 1-4, extending to size 8 which is commonly used.
```

**Bug fix** (explain the issue):
```
fix: correct carry propagation in uint addition

The carry bit was not properly propagated when the first limb
overflowed but subsequent limbs were at MAX-1. This caused
incorrect results for specific input patterns.

Added test case that reproduces the issue.
```

**Simple feature** (title often sufficient):
```
feat: add From<u128> implementation for Uint<256>
```

**Complex change** (needs explanation):
```
refactor: split trie updates into parallel work queues

Previous implementation processed all trie updates sequentially,
creating a bottleneck during state root calculation. This change:

- Partitions updates by key prefix
- Processes non-conflicting updates in parallel
- Falls back to sequential for conflicts
- Maintains deterministic ordering

Reduces state root time from 120ms to 35ms on 16-core machines.
```

#### What NOT to Do

- Don't write generic descriptions: "Update code", "Fix bug"
- Don't use many bullet points unless listing multiple distinct changes
- Don't make up metrics without measurements
- Don't write essays - be concise but complete

#### Key Principles

1. **The title should make sense in a changelog**
2. **The body should explain to a future developer why this change was necessary**
3. **Include concrete measurements for performance claims**
4. **Reference issues when fixing bugs**: `Fixes #12345`
5. **Let improvements stand on their own merit** - don't invent generic justifications
6. **Match detail to complexity** - Simple changes need simple descriptions

### Pull Request Descriptions

PR descriptions should provide reviewers with the context they need to understand changes, while avoiding verbosity and AI-sounding language.

#### Core Principles

1. **Be descriptive but concise** - Include what reviewers need, nothing more
2. **Explain what and why** - Help reviewers understand the changes and motivation
3. **Include real measurements** - Only include numbers you've actually measured
4. **Link related work** - Reference issues, discussions, and dependencies
5. **Write well** - Use flowing prose, not bullet points. Good writing matters

#### PR Title

Clear, specific titles that make the purpose obvious:
- `feat: add state provider metrics`
- `fix: correct modexp edge case handling`
- `perf: optimize reserve_nodes allocation`

#### PR Body Patterns

**Bug fix with context**:
```
The validator was incorrectly handling empty block bodies, causing panics
during sync. Fixed by adding proper bounds checking before accessing block data.

Fixes #12345
```

**Feature with explanation**:
```
Needed for graceful shutdown and testing scenarios where we need to drop all 
connections without restarting the entire service. The method ensures all 
pending operations complete before clearing the pool.

Will be used in #15648
```

**Linking dependencies**:
```
The old revm state access API is deprecated and will be removed in the next 
major version. This migrates to the new API which provides better performance
and cleaner error handling.

depends on https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/pull/16179
```

**Performance with evidence**:
```
Previously `reserve_nodes` took ~30% of time in revealing

Main profile: https://share.firefox.dev/3S18zep
After: https://share.firefox.dev/4T29afq
```

**Feature with multiple aspects**:
```
State access during EVM execution was a black box - we had no visibility into
where time was spent. Now we track fetch times for storage slots, account data,
and contract code throughout block processing.

The metrics use our existing prometheus infrastructure and are exposed on the 
standard metrics endpoint. They're sampled at 10% by default to minimize overhead,
configurable via `--metrics-sample-rate`. Initial data shows storage access 
dominates execution time at 60-70% of total state operations.
```

**Complex features**:
```
Release builds were leaving performance on the table by not leveraging runtime
profiling data. Profile-guided optimization can improve performance by 15-20% by
optimizing based on real usage patterns. PGO works by first building with
instrumentation, running representative workloads, then rebuilding with the 
collected profile data to optimize hot paths.

The implementation includes build scripts for the two-phase process and CI 
integration to generate profiles from sync benchmarks. Profile data is cached
for 7 days to avoid regenerating on every build.

Usage:
```bash
./scripts/pgo-build.sh
```

#### Bad vs Good Examples

**Bad** (too verbose, AI-sounding):
```
fix: improve error handling in RPC module

## Description
This PR enhances the error handling capabilities of the RPC module by implementing
more granular error types. By introducing these changes, we ensure that users
receive more informative error messages, which will help with debugging.

## Changes Made
- 🚀 Added new error types for different failure scenarios
- 📝 Updated error messages to be more descriptive
- ✅ Added tests to verify error handling

## Benefits
This will improve the developer experience by providing clearer error messages.
```

**Bad** (too minimal, unhelpful):

```
fix: add RPC error types

Closes #5678
```

**Good** (descriptive with flowing prose):
```
fix: add specific RPC error types

Previously all RPC errors returned generic "internal error" messages, making it 
impossible for users to understand what went wrong or how to fix it. We now have
specific error types for common failure modes: `InvalidBlockNumber` when requesting 
blocks outside the available range, `StateNotAvailable` for pruned state requests, 
and `ResourceExhausted` for rate limiting scenarios.

Users now receive actionable error messages that explain the problem and suggest
solutions, rather than opaque 500 errors that require diving into server logs.

Closes #5678
```

#### When More Detail is Needed

Some PRs benefit from more comprehensive descriptions:

1. **Performance improvements** - Include benchmarks, profiles, and methodology
2. **Breaking changes** - Explain what breaks and migration path
3. **Complex features** - Describe architecture and design decisions
4. **Bug fixes for subtle issues** - Explain root cause and fix approach
5. **External context** - Link to discussions, RFCs, or design docs

For complex changes, don't artificially limit yourself. Include what reviewers need to understand the change properly. The goal is clarity, not arbitrary brevity.

#### Writing Quality Matters

Good PR descriptions demonstrate strong technical writing skills. Use complete sentences that flow naturally from one to another. Avoid bullet-point lists when prose would be more effective. Your description should read like a well-written technical explanation to a colleague, not a checklist or template.

**Scale detail to match complexity**. A simple bug fix needs a paragraph explaining the issue and solution. A performance optimization might need two paragraphs covering the problem and the measured improvement. A major architectural change warrants the full story: what problem existed, why it mattered, how you solved it, and what the impact is.

The key is judgment - include enough context for reviewers to understand your change without overwhelming them with unnecessary detail for straightforward PRs.

#### Key Point

Good PR descriptions provide the context reviewers need without unnecessary verbosity. Write naturally, be specific about what changed and why, and include real measurements for performance claims. The goal is to help reviewers understand your changes quickly and thoroughly.

### CRITICAL: Never Make Up Measurements

**NEVER include performance numbers, benchmarks, or metrics unless you have actually measured them!** This is especially important for AI agents who might be tempted to invent plausible-sounding numbers.

#### Bad (made-up numbers):
```
perf: optimize trie lookups

~3x faster on mainnet blocks
- Before: 120ms
- After: 40ms
```

#### Good (only what you measured):
```
perf: optimize trie lookups

Benchmarked with `cargo bench trie_lookup`:
- Before: 120ms
- After: 40ms
```

#### Also Good (no numbers if not measured):
```
perf: optimize trie lookups by caching decoded nodes

Previous implementation decoded nodes on every access.
Now maintains decoded cache with LRU eviction.
```

If you haven't run benchmarks, don't include numbers. Describe the optimization approach instead.

### Code Review Analysis

When analyzing code or PRs:

1. **Be specific and actionable** - Reference exact lines and types
2. **Suggest alternatives with code** - Don't just identify issues
3. **Consider performance implications** - Question allocations and algorithms
4. **Focus on what matters** - Correctness > Performance > Style

## Common commands

Working with Rust projects typically involves using `cargo` for building, testing, and benchmarking. Here are some common commands you might need:
```bash
# Run specific benchmarks
cargo bench --workspace benchmark_name

# Run tests
cargo test

# Format code (use nightly)
cargo +nightly fmt

# Run lints
cargo clippy --all-features --all-targets
```

### Before Committing

Run the checks that CI will run before committing. For specific projects, `.github` workflows can be used to find the standard build, lint, and formatting
commands for that project.

#### 1. Formatting Check

```bash
# Check formatting (CI uses nightly)
cargo +nightly fmt --all --check

# Auto-fix formatting issues
cargo +nightly fmt --all
```

#### 2. Clippy Linting (Required for rust projects)
In reth for example, the command run in CI is more involved than just `cargo clippy` due to specific features and flags used in the project:
```bash
# For specific projects, check their CI for exact commands
# Reth example:
RUSTFLAGS="-D warnings" cargo clippy --workspace --lib --examples --tests --benches --locked --features "ethereum asm-keccak jemalloc jemalloc-prof min-error-logs min-warn-logs min-info-logs min-debug-logs min-trace-logs"
```

#### 3. Tests
```bash
cargo test --workspace
```

#### Common CI Failures and Fixes

**Formatting issues**: Just run `cargo +nightly fmt` if using nightly, or `cargo fmt --all` for stable.

**Clippy warnings**:
- Fix the specific warnings shown, follow clippy recommendations
- Some projects allow `#[allow(clippy::...)]` for false positives

## Critical Reminders

### DO NOT

- Create documentation files unless explicitly requested
- Modify reference repositories
- Make up performance numbers or generic justifications for changes
- Create standalone test files instead of using test infrastructure. Use the project's build system (such as `cargo`) and create tests runnable with `cargo test`.

### ALWAYS

- Check if repositories are already cloned locally
- Work in designated workspace directories for modifications (and work with git worktrees)
- Use existing benchmark infrastructure
- Follow project patterns and conventions
- Measure performance changes properly
- Let improvements stand on their technical merit
- Read relevant documentation before starting tasks
