# Agent Guidelines for FF-WebHID

Before you act, read `CONTRIBUTING.md` for the project's design principles. They apply to you too.

## Terminology

- **FF**: Firefox, the project's target browser.
- **HID**: Human Interface Device (USB/Bluetooth input devices).
- **WS / WT / NM**: WebSocket / WebTransport / Native Messaging, the three data-plane transports of the `dataPlane` setting.
- **SAB**: SharedArrayBuffer (removed from the data plane in 2026-07, see below).
- **TLV**: Type-Length-Value, the binary wire format for packed NM messages and collections.
- **VID / PID**: Vendor ID / Product ID (USB device identifiers).
- **COOP / COEP**: Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy / Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy.
- **IPC**: Inter-Process Communication. **GC**: Garbage Collection.

## Architecture decisions

### Verify "ceilings" before accepting them

Bugs have repeatedly been mistaken for architectural ceilings. Check logs/behavior first. Past false ceilings (each cost a debug cycle):

- "Worker + SAB at the performance ceiling": Worker+SAB never engaged; everything silently fell back to NM.
- "SAB push must run on a Worker to avoid blocking via `Atomics.wait`": false after the drain moved to non-blocking `Atomics.waitAsync`; that mechanism was never in the flow.
- "SAB is zero-copy, so it must be fastest": false by half. SAB write is zero-copy but drain still copies once (`HIDInputReportEvent` needs exclusive ownership). The no-SAB path (`postMessage` + Transferable) is zero-copy end to end.
- "Transfer the whole WS frame buffer instead of copying the payload" broke Chromium WebHID semantics: pages do `new Uint8Array(event.data.buffer)`, so `event.data.buffer.byteLength` must equal `event.data.byteLength` (`byteOffset === 0`). Reverted (saved ~30-50µs/report). Lesson: count copies and shape changes to the consumer; the `.buffer` contract is part of the journey.

### WS data plane runs in a dedicated Worker

Profiler-confirmed: WS receive/parse on the content main thread competes with page rendering (510 vs 681 msg/s late-phase under render load); NM is CPU-isolated (subprocess).

**Final WS architecture**: `daemon <-WS-> Worker (no SAB) <-MessageChannel port, transferred once at setup-> page`.

- The Worker owns the WS connection and posts each report directly to the page via the transferred port. One hop per report, zero copies.
- The bridge only spawns/despawns workers and relays the port once; it sits on no per-message hot path. Data worker is per-device, spawned on `open()`, killed on close.
- Fallback: 2-hop relay (worker → bridge → page, both Transferable) if direct port transfer fails.
- Data plane switches mid-session (WS ↔ NM) via one control-plane command; a duplicated/dropped report in the switch instant is accepted as user-caused.

### SAB removed entirely (2026-07)

After the ring-buffer alloc bug was fixed, SAB lost to the simpler no-SAB path while carrying ongoing costs (COOP/COEP, Atomics/ring-buffer complexity). It was a necessary rung: it found the alloc bug and the CPU contention. Ring buffer detail: 8192 slots sized by an _estimated_ max report size was a 16MB init allocation; exact per-report size at parse time + 64 slots fixed it (later removed with SAB). Drain never needed >1 occupied slot, even at 8000Hz.

### Rate-gated WS batching (2026-08)

Under a render-saturated main thread, WS loses ~1.6-4.3% of input reports at >= ~3kHz (source-verified in mozilla-central: WS-to-worker delivery crosses the content main thread via PWebSocket IPC → `RecvOnBinaryMessageAvailable` → unbounded `ChannelEventQueue`; no drop mechanism, just late delivery counted as lost after the drain window). NM drops 0. Drop curve scales with frame rate (~1-4% at 1000-8000 frames/s, 0 at 125/s): queuing delay, not per-frame probability.

Fix: `run_sender` (`crates/webhid-daemon/src/batching.rs`) tracks reports flushed per 4ms window; at 12 reports/4ms (~3kHz) it accumulates ~8ms frames instead of flushing per ~1ms. Sparse traffic keeps the 25µs coalesce path (p50 unchanged, 0.86-0.92ms). Render-load loss: 4.32% worst-run → 0.000-0.583%. WT shares `run_sender` (loss 0.000). Tradeoff: >= ~3kHz streams pay up to 8ms delivery latency (chunked, in order). Knobs: `WEBHID_WS_HIGH_RATE_MS` (8), `WEBHID_WS_RATE_WINDOW_MS` (4), `WEBHID_WS_HIGH_RATE_COUNT` (12); fixed `WEBHID_WS_BATCH_MS` path also exists. Do not remove the rate gate: idle benchmarks never see the drop; repro needs the 8000Hz loss workload on a render-saturated page.

### Tradeoffs without a universally correct answer become settings

Single `dataPlane` setting (`ws` / `wt` / `nm`). Control plane (handshake, open/close, setDataPlane) always goes over the NM port in the background: NM control verifies the peer at OS level (SO_PEERCRED + webhid group on the abstract socket) on top of the session token; ws control was token-only and removed (c964326, 2026-07-22). Default is `wt` (profiler: ~18pp less content main-thread CPU, 3.8x less main-thread IPC under render load; WT reads a DataPipe on the worker with zero WebSocket IPC), `ws` on older Firefox; WS is the fallback when the WT port is not offered or page CSP forces NM.

## Project facts

### Benchmarks

- The `open` metric (38-58ms) is NOT a daemon regression: `open()` itself ~15ms (worker spawn + NM control round trip + collections) plus a one-time ~25ms first-WS-message penalty in Firefox's WS IPC (later sends ~0.7ms round trip). Older docs numbers (20-23ms) measured a phase without the penalty.
- Cold-start methodology: local sayodevice.com clone removes network variance; Playwright-driven removes click timing; Chromium grants via policy.
- Image-pipeline benchmark (`tests/benchmark/`, see [docs/BENCHMARK.md](docs/BENCHMARK.md)): bursts of ~330 consecutive reports drop on the page side (ws 30-36, nm 7-37 mid-session); the FIRST burst after cold start or a data-plane switch is the lossiest. Benchmark invalidates dropped runs, retries, and runs an unmeasured warm-up burst per cold-start spec. Normal-rate e2e is drop-free; do not extrapolate burst loss to normal use.
- Benchmark chunking protocols differ per harness on purpose: the image pipeline chunks a 62-byte payload + 2-byte sequence (tests/pages/benchmark-image.html + benchmark-utils PAYLOAD), the loss harness uses a 63-byte payload + 3-byte sequence (loss-utils). The page-side decoders match their own harness; keep them in sync pairwise, not across harnesses.

- Hung-ack fix (2026-08): the data worker never settled in-flight send promises when WS dropped. `onClosed` rejects and clears `pending`; the page gets a fast `'ws closed'` rejection. Benchmark pitfalls: prime with an awaited 96-report burst, time-boxed per send (fire-and-forget inflates ws total ~2s; a single global gate falsely fails slow primes).

### Test harness traps

- e2e devices (`tests/helpers/e2e-devices.ts`, VID 0x16c0): vendor=0x0001 (report ID 1, 64-byte in/out; primary chain + feature reports; send-side rejects report types the descriptor does not declare, matching Chromium's `max_*_report_size() == 0` gates), gamepad=0x0002 (no report ID, 5-byte input; WS-data-plane-with-URL-fragment + fresh-pairing gates), mouse=0x0003, keyboard=0x0004. Lazy spawn, reused across the serial chain.
- `hidreport` rejects "Missing Usages for main item" when reportCount exceeds declared usages on a Data/Variable item; const items sidestep the check.
- Concurrent-run WS drop: running the e2e and forwarder configs concurrently occasionally drops a vendor input report (WS CPU contention). Each config runs the e2e dir (32 tests) with `workers: 1` baked in.
- Firefox 150+ LNA (`network.lna.blocking`, default true) gates page-context WebTransport to loopback: a public origin hitting localhost gets a one-time "Allow" prompt; loopback-origin pages and worker-context WT are exempt. Page-context WT cannot survive Juggler interception (`context.route('**/*')` → `SetupReplacementChannel` → `NS_ERROR_NOT_AVAILABLE`, bridge falls back to NM after 10s): no catch-all route in `tests/helpers/e2e.ts`, ever.
- Browser-harness limitations: each Playwright page runs in its own Firefox window (a popup opened via `newPage()` never sees another page's tab as active in its window); visually hidden toggle inputs need `check({ force: true })`; `storage.local.get(null)` throws `EmptyDatabaseError` (keyed `get` works). These blocked a Playwright spec for the popup origin picker; it was verified manually.
- OS permissions: macOS needs Input Monitoring (TCC) granted manually; Windows none (`HidD_*`); Linux `udev`/`eudev` (Alpine `mdev`).

### Daemon deployment

Two modes, both must keep working: (1) persistent root daemon + thin NM-host forwarder over Unix socket (no udev rules); (2) daemon-as-NM-host spawned by Firefox running as the user (needs udev rules).

### Blocklist (verified 1:1 vs Chromium/WICG, 2026-08-03)

Two layers, always-on like Chromium:

1. Device-level (`hid.rs`): FIDO usage page 0xF1D0 + per-product security-key list (Chromium `kStaticEntries`); hidden from enumeration.
2. Report-level (`blocklist.rs`/`report_blocking.rs`): WICG `blocklist.txt` entry-for-entry (FIDO, GD Mouse/Keyboard/Keypad/SystemControl, Jabra, OnlyKey). Any-match per (report_id, type) over a report→collection map where each report carries every ancestor collection's usage (a Mouse report in a Physical child IS blocked); plus hardcoded always-protected usages (page 0x07; GD Pointer/Mouse/Keyboard/Keypad; GD SystemControl 0x80-0x8f, 0xa0-0xb6); plus an undocumented-report-ID fallback (blocks when the device has an always-protected top-level). Unparseable/empty descriptors fail closed: the device is hidden from enumeration and `open()` refuses it, since there is no collection tree to classify reports against (2026-08-20 audit fix; the `dump` subcommand still lists it with the parse error). Input dropped at the reader; output/feature rejected; sends pre-checked like Chromium's `HidConnection::Write` / `GetFeatureReport` / `SendFeatureReport` gates (a report type the descriptor does not declare, `max_*_report_size() == 0`, is rejected). Blocked reports pruned from page-visible `collections` (`prune_device_info`); all-empty devices hidden. SayoDevice config uses distinct report IDs, so only its keyboard report 1 is blocked. Keep fixtures off Mouse/Keyboard/Keypad usages if they must receive reports.

### Consent model (2026-08-06)

A page cannot grant itself a device or see the full inventory. `pairDevice`/`recordGrantGroup`/`getGrantGroups`/`getAllPairedDevices`/`revokeDevice`/`getDeviceCache`/`getDeviceInfo`/`showPicker`/`pickerResult` are blocked from page ports (`PAGE_BLOCKED_ACTIONS`, 403). Page `enumerate` is rewritten to `enumeratePaired`; the background filters to the requesting origin's paired hashes (chooser/extension pages call `enumerate` directly). Pairing runs in the bridge after chooser selection (`grantSelectedDevices`); `pickerResult` rejected unless `sender.url` is the picker page. Devices granted together form a grant group (IndexedDB `grantGroups`); revoking any member cascades to the group; affected page devices settle pending sends with `AbortError` via the `revoked` event. Polyfill `forget()` un-pairs its device.

### Permissions Policy trust (2026-08-09)

`hasAllowAttr` comes from the requesting port's source `Window` (engine-set `event.source`) matched against `iframe[allow*="hid"]`, cross-checked with the port's `event.origin`; the forwarded URL is that port origin, never a MAIN-world document URL. The MAIN-world `getCallerFrameUrl()` (stack parsing) was removed: `window.Error`/`location` are page-overridable in the MAIN world, letting a cross-origin iframe forge a sibling's `allow="hid"`. Regression: forge test in `tests/browser/permissions-policy.spec.ts`.

### Worker polyfill init (2026-08-09)

The worker polyfill creates its own bridge port; no page-side init decision. On load, the injected bundle (webRequest gate: global `workerPolyfillEnabled` or the per-site key for the WORKER SCRIPT's origin) snapshots `MessageChannel` (before page code can patch it), keeps one end as its bridge port, posts `null` + the other end to the page; `PatchedWorker`'s instance listener swallows that message and forwards the port via `workerPort`. Plain/blob/data workers never post, so never receive a spurious init message. It also wraps `navigator.permissions.query({name:'hid'})`. Shadow-URL interception: the MAIN world requests `armShadowSpawn` (tab+document keyed, one-shot, 3s TTL backstop, fail-open after 2s) before spawning the data worker from `new Worker(location.href)`; the webRequest handler serves the worker bundle only when armed, consumed on the real worker fetch. `shadowRedirectTargets` tracks redirect hops without the arm. The data bundle's `null`+port `'ready'` reply branch was removed; production workers spawn via `NativeWorker` in `handleSpawnWorkerRequest`, driven by `setPorts`, ready via `onReady`. Cross-origin worker scripts can't be exercised in the browser harness (network bridge re-serves without CORS headers). Regression: `tests/browser/worker.spec.ts`.

### Polyfill realm and MessagePort gotchas

The polyfill runs in the MAIN world and pre-claims pristine `MessagePort`/`MessageChannel`/`Worker.prototype.postMessage`/`window.postMessage` at document_start. Gotchas: (1) `addEventListener` does not implicitly start a `MessagePort`; call `start()` or responses never dispatch (30s sendRequest timeouts). (2) `window.postMessage` targets `this`; never bind it when an iframe polyfill posts to `window.top` (cross-origin iframe tests catch this). Regression: `tests/e2e/picker-bypass.spec.ts`.

Polyfill-polyfill port race (2026-07): same-origin iframes each run a polyfill; request IDs start at 0 and collide in the bridge's numeric `requestPortMap` (wrong-frame delivery). Fix: prefix with a per-polyfill `crypto.randomUUID()` nonce (`frameNonce + ':' + ++nextReqId`).

### NM wire format

Hot-path reports: packed binary TLVs (`PKG_SEND_REPORT` 0x02, `PKG_SEND_FEATURE_REPORT` 0x04, `PKG_INPUT_REPORT` 0x01) as base64 in one JSON field `{"d":"<b64>"}`. Collections: TLV module (`crates/webhid/src/collections_tlv.rs`, `[tag:u8][len:varint][value]`, unknown-tag skip; JS decoder `addon/js/utils/descriptor-tlv.js`). Compression rejected (CPU/alloc > savings at this size). NM has a real 1MB message ceiling (app→browser).

### CSP relaxation and MV3

MV2 may fully replace/strip a page's CSP ([bug 1635781](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1635781)); MV3 is "strengthen only", always cumulative ([bug 1785821](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1785821), header merging [bug 1462989](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1462989)); no MV3 full-override permission exists ([bug 1787155](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1787155), open). Default manifest is MV3: blob-URL workers + CSP rewriting cannot work there (only `manifest.v2.json`). Content scripts cannot spawn workers from `moz-extension://` URLs. When page CSP blocks the shadow worker, the only MV3 fallback is NM. The background does CSP pre-flight (`getCspInfo`) so the bridge skips doomed spawns.

### Popup origin picker (2026-08)

The popup's site label is a custom dropdown (no `<select>`) listing the active tab's top-level origin first, then distinct http(s) origins of frames running the polyfill. Origins come from the top-frame bridge's `portOrigin` map (engine-set `event.origin` per page port) via a `getFrameOrigins` message; frames that never run the polyfill (sandboxed without scripts, blob/data frames, CSP-blocked contexts) are absent. Selecting an origin re-runs settings load/save against that origin's `siteSettingKey` keys and re-renders devices/status. The popup re-resolves the active tab on `tabs.onActivated`; when it is itself open as a tab whose window's active tab is itself (dev/testing), it falls back to the active http(s) tab of any window (never in production: the action popup is not a tab).

### Exploratory branches (curiosity-driven, not benchmark-justified)

- **WT/QUIC data plane** (`dataPlane: "wt"`): daemon WT server at boot (self-signed ECDSA P-256, SAN 127.0.0.1, ≤14-day validity, pinned via `serverCertificateHashes`); auth via URL path; one persistent bidirectional stream with `[len_u32 LE]` frame prefix; data worker auto-reconnects post-ready (500ms→5s exponential backoff, same as WS); cert renewal rotates to a fresh port with drain. p50 0.85ms vs ws 0.78ms / nm 1.77ms (loopback): TLS/QUIC costs ~+0.07ms/report; ws remains the fastest Firefox path. Seccomp needed `SYS_fcntl` + `SYS_recvmmsg`. Covered by `tests/e2e/wt.spec.ts` + `tests/benchmark/benchmark-wt.spec.ts`.
- **Chromium native-WebHID benchmark** (`chromium-benchmark`, headless): mock pre-granted via `WebHidAllowDevicesForUrls` policy; fixed port 8123 (policy matches origins including port); `channel: 'chromium'` required (chrome-headless-shell has no udev/HID layer); never `--no-sandbox` (breaks udev). Finding: `vendor.bin`'s report ID 1 sat between two top-level collections, which Chromium's HID parser does not carry across; the ID now lives inside the vendor collection. Chromium p50 ~0.3-0.4ms; its `performance.now()` is clamped to 100µs, benchmark page uses COOP/COEP for 5µs precision.
- **Chromium testbed** (`chromium-testbed` branch): runs the addon itself on Chromium via `TARGET=chromium npm run build:addon` (unpacked `dist/chromium/`) to measure addon overhead vs native WebHID in the same runtime. Conventions:
  - Daemon `detect_nm_host_mode` also accepts Chrome's launch convention: one arg, the caller origin (`chrome-extension://<id>/`), instead of Firefox's manifest path + id. The tuple's first slot is only for logging.
  - Chrome for Testing (Playwright's `channel: 'chromium'`, v151, strace-verified) reads native messaging manifests from `<userDataDir>/NativeMessagingHosts/`, not `~/.config/*`. `tests/helpers/chromium-addon.ts` installs the daemon manifest there per test.
  - Chromium MV3 cannot share `globalThis` across multi-file script arrays (one SW file, content-script arrays), so the build bundles each world (background, MAIN, ISOLATED) into one file from the `addon/manifest.json` lists, prepending `js/utils/browser-shim.js` (`browser = chrome`) only where the chrome API exists (background SW and ISOLATED world, derived from each content script's `world` field; the MAIN world has no extension API (`browser.*` / `chrome.runtime`), so the alias would be useless there and is skipped). The shim is also injected into extension page HTMLs (they call `browser.*` and Chromium page realms have no `browser`). Firefox is unaffected (shim is a no-op; the chromium target skips web-ext).
  - `registerWebRequestHandlers` early-returns on the shared `isChromium` flag (exported from `js/utils/bootstrap.js`, post-alias URL-scheme check): MV3 webRequest is observational only. The gate disables the shadow-URL spawn, so blob is the only functional spawn mode on Chromium: `GLOBAL_DEFAULTS.workerSpawnMode` defaults to `'blob'` there, `resolveSpawnMode` forces blob, and the Worker Spawn Mode setting is hidden from the popup/settings UI. The pageAction picker mode is likewise not offered (no pageAction API; a saved `'pageAction'` value is coerced to modal at the bridge, and the background's `openPickerPageAction`, including its inactive-tab notification, is gated to Firefox). The benchmark page has no CSP, so ws/wt spawn their worker via the blob path. Without the gate the blocking listener registration throws and breaks boot.
  - The testbed runs all four data planes (`tests/benchmark/chromium-addon/`): nm, ws, wt (blob worker), wt-inpage (`useWorker: false`). Run it on its own: one early wt execution ran alongside other benchmarks and showed ~4.7ms p50, sequential runs are stable at ~0.6ms.
  - Chromium does not render SVG extension icons; `addon/icons/*.png` are rasterized from the SVGs.
  - Chromium extension messaging uses structured clone via `"message_serialization": "structured_clone"` in `manifest.chromium.json` (Chrome 148+ per `minimum_chrome_version`); Firefox's extension messaging is always structured clone, so TypedArrays survive every extension-messaging hop on both engines with no boundary rebuild. Native messaging is always JSON regardless of the key; report payloads cross it as base64 strings, decoded/encoded at the daemon edge, so no TypedArray ever touches NM.
  - On Chromium, `dialog.showModal()` inside the closed picker shadow root does not move focus into it. Pairing focuses the dialog with a header click, waits for the item to render (the modal opens before the enumerate round trip finishes), then drives Tab/Enter (tab stops: item, item's radio, Cancel, Connect).

## Not every change needs a benchmark-driven justification

Some changes were made because they were interesting to try (binary-packed collections, WebTransport exploration). Don't retroactively invent a performance rationale; note it as such.

## Writing style: no em-dashes

Don't use em-dashes ("—") anywhere in this document or in any writing produced for this project. Rewrite with smoother sentence flow (subordinate clauses, "since"/"so"/"which", or splitting into two sentences), or fall back to a comma, colon, semicolon, or parentheses when a harder break is actually needed. Em-dash is a style tic to actively avoid, not just deprioritize.
