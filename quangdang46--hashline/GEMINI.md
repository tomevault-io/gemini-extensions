## hashline — Hash-Anchored File Editing

`hashline` is a file editing tool that uses content-hashed line anchors (`12:ab3f`) instead of fragile exact-text matching. It's designed for agent-driven editing where concurrent changes are expected and edit safety is critical.

### Why It's Useful

- **Stable anchors:** Uses `line:hash` format that survives nearby edits—line numbers shift but hashes stay valid
- **Concurrent-safe:** Detects stale anchors when content changed; fails explicitly instead of guessing
- **Audit trail:** Optional `--receipt` and `--audit-log` for tracking edit history
- **No merge conflicts:** Each edit is independent; no patch files that conflict
- **Works with any text:** Language-agnostic; no parsing required

### The Anchor Format

Anchors are `line_number:content_hash` pairs like `42:a3f2`:

- **line_number**: 1-based line number (for human readability)
- **content_hash**: First 4+ chars of SHA-256 of line content (for stability)

Example output from `hashline read`:
```
  1:a1b2  fn main() {
  2:c3d4      println!("hello");
  3:e5f6  }
```

### Command Reference

### Typical Agent Workflow

1. **Read file with anchors:**
   ```bash
   hashline read src/main.rs
   ```

2. **Find specific content:**
   ```bash
   hashline grep src/main.rs "fn process" --json
   ```

3. **Apply targeted edit:**
   ```bash
   hashline edit src/main.rs 42:a3f2 "fn process_data(input: &str) -> Result<()> {"
   ```

4. **Verify change:**
   ```bash
   hashline read src/main.rs --anchor 42:a3f2
   ```

5. **If anchor is stale, re-read and retry:**
   ```bash
   hashline read src/main.rs  # Get fresh anchors
   hashline edit src/main.rs 42:new_hash "..."
   ```

### Range Edits

Replace multiple lines with range syntax:

```bash
# Replace lines 10-15
hashline edit src/main.rs 10:a1b2..15:c3d4 "new content\nspanning\nmultiple lines"

# Delete lines 20-25
hashline delete src/main.rs 20:e5f6..25:g7h8
```

### Multi-Line Patches (USE STDIN — never create .patch files)

For multi-op patches, use `hashline patch` with stdin. **Never** write a `.patch` file to disk first:

```bash
# ✅ CORRECT — stdin via heredoc, no disk I/O
hashline patch src/main.rs - <<'EOF'
*** Begin Patch
SWAP 42:a3f2:
+fn process_data(input: &str) -> Result<()> {
+    todo!()
+}
SWAP 45:1a2b:
+    Ok(())
*** End Patch
EOF

# ❌ WRONG — creates a stale .patch file littering /tmp
cat > /tmp/something.patch <<'EOF'
...patch content...
EOF
hashline patch src/main.rs @/tmp/something.patch
```

**Why stdin wins:**
- No intermediate file on disk (no cleanup needed, no `/tmp` litter)
- 1 process spawn vs 1 spawn + 1 file write + 1 file read
- ~3x faster for typical patches
- Atomic — patch content is bound to the command, not a stale file

**`hashline patch <file> <patch>` argument modes:**
- `hashline patch file -` → read from stdin
- `hashline patch file @/path/to/file` → read from a file (only when patch is reused or pre-existing)
- `hashline patch file "literal text"` → use the argument as-is (no newlines in shell-safe form)

When in doubt: **stdin first, `@path` only if you already have a patch file on disk for another reason**.

### Safety Features

**Stale anchor detection:**
```
Error: anchor 42:a3f2 is stale (line content changed)
Hint: re-run `hashline read src/main.rs` to get fresh anchors
```

**Ambiguous anchor detection:**
```
Error: anchor 42:a3 matches multiple lines
Hint: use more hash characters: 42:a3f2e1
```

**Dry-run mode:**
```bash
hashline edit src/main.rs 42:a3f2 "new content" --dry-run
```

**Audit logging:**
```bash
hashline edit src/main.rs 42:a3f2 "new content" --receipt --audit-log edits.jsonl
```

### JSON Output

All commands support `--json` for machine-readable output:

```bash
hashline read src/main.rs --json
hashline grep src/main.rs "fn " --json
hashline edit src/main.rs 42:a3f2 "new" --json
```

### Common Pitfalls

- **Stale anchor:** Content changed since last read → re-run `hashline read`
- **Ambiguous anchor:** Hash too short → use more characters from original hash
- **Line shifted:** Nearby edits changed line numbers → hash still works, just re-read
- **File deleted:** Obviously fails → check file exists before editing
- **Binary file:** Only works on text files → don't use on binaries
- **`.patch` file litter:** If you find yourself writing `cat > /tmp/foo.patch` before `hashline patch file @foo.patch` — STOP. Use stdin (`hashline patch file - <<'EOF' ... EOF`) instead. Creating the file is ~3x slower, leaves debris in `/tmp`, and gives you a stale-file footgun if the patch drifts before apply.

### Rules for Agents (MANDATORY — Philosophy of hashline)

hashline is NOT str_replace. It is NOT sed. It is NOT fuzzy matching. These rules are MANDATORY — they define what hashline IS and what it IS NOT.

**Core identity — the read→patch cycle is a feature, not a bug:**
- `hashline read` provides content-hash anchors (`42:a3`). `hashline patch` targets those anchors. This cycle is what makes edits **verifiable** and **safe**.
- **Do NOT attempt to eliminate the read→patch cycle.** Every extra round-trip is intentional safety. The 200ms read cost is negligible vs a corrupted file that takes minutes to debug.
- **hashline's value is safety through verifiability.** If the agent wants str_replace semantics (fuzzy matching, no pre-read), it should use `str_replace` directly. hashline will not degrade itself to compete on speed.

**Stale-anchor handling:**
- **Treat stale-anchor failures as safety signals, NEVER as errors to bypass.**
- **Never force an edit, never auto-re-read, never fuzzy match.** The only correct response to `StaleAnchor` is: `hashline read <file>` to get fresh anchors, then retry.
- **hashline rejects stale edits before they corrupt your file.** That is the WHOLE POINT.

**Usage discipline:**
- **Always `hashline read <file>` before `hashline patch <file>`**. The read must be the latest — don't use cached hashes.
- **Use `--dry-run` first** when editing critical files.
- **Use `--json` output** for parsing in scripts.
- **Never modify a file with hashline without having called `hashline read` on it first in the same logical edit session.**
- **For multi-line patches, ALWAYS use stdin** (`hashline patch file - <<'EOF' ... EOF`). Never write a `.patch` file to disk first — it adds ~3x latency, clutters `/tmp`, and creates stale-file risk. `@path` is only for the rare case where a patch file already exists for another reason (e.g. test fixtures, version-controlled patches).

**What hashline is NOT for:**
- **Fuzzy replacement:** That's `str_replace`. hashline is anchor-based, not content-based.
- **Whole-file rewrites:** Use the `write` tool or `std::fs::write`.
- **Binary files:** hashline only works on UTF-8 text.
- **Complex refactors:** Use tree-sitter based tools for AST-aware changes.
- **Bulk multi-edit optimization:** If you need to make 10 edits, call `hashline read` once, then call `hashline patch` 10 times. Each patch returns the new file hash. The next patch verifies against that hash. This is the safety model — do not try to batch or collapse it.

**If you find the read→patch cycle "friction":**
1. You are using hashline for a task better suited to another tool.
2. Use `str_replace` or `write` for that task instead.
3. Do not ask hashline to compromise its safety model.

## MCP Agent Mail — Multi-Agent Coordination

A mail-like layer that lets coding agents coordinate asynchronously via MCP tools and resources. Provides identities, inbox/outbox, searchable threads, and advisory file reservations with human-auditable artifacts in Git.

### Why It's Useful

- **Prevents conflicts:** Explicit file reservations (leases) for files/globs
- **Token-efficient:** Messages stored in per-project archive, not in context
- **Quick reads:** `resource://inbox/...`, `resource://thread/...`

### Same Repository Workflow

1. **Register identity:**
   ```
   ensure_project(project_key=<abs-path>)
   register_agent(project_key, program, model)
   ```

2. **Reserve files before editing:**
   ```
   file_reservation_paths(project_key, agent_name, ["src/**"], ttl_seconds=3600, exclusive=true)
   ```

3. **Communicate with threads:**
   ```
   send_message(..., thread_id="FEAT-123")
   fetch_inbox(project_key, agent_name)
   acknowledge_message(project_key, agent_name, message_id)
   ```

4. **Quick reads:**
   ```
   resource://inbox/{Agent}?project=<abs-path>&limit=20
   resource://thread/{id}?project=<abs-path>&include_bodies=true
   ```

### Macros vs Granular Tools

- **Prefer macros for speed:** `macro_start_session`, `macro_prepare_thread`, `macro_file_reservation_cycle`, `macro_contact_handshake`
- **Use granular tools for control:** `register_agent`, `file_reservation_paths`, `send_message`, `fetch_inbox`, `acknowledge_message`

### Common Pitfalls

- `"from_agent not registered"`: Always `register_agent` in the correct `project_key` first
- `"FILE_RESERVATION_CONFLICT"`: Adjust patterns, wait for expiry, or use non-exclusive reservation
- **Auth errors:** If JWT+JWKS enabled, include bearer token with matching `kid`

## Beads (br) — Dependency-Aware Issue Tracking

Beads provides a lightweight, dependency-aware issue database and CLI (`br` - beads_rust) for selecting "ready work," setting priorities, and tracking status. It complements MCP Agent Mail's messaging and file reservations.

**Important:** `br` is non-invasive—it NEVER runs git commands automatically. You must manually commit changes after `br sync --flush-only`.

### Conventions

- **Single source of truth:** Beads for task status/priority/dependencies; Agent Mail for conversation and audit
- **Shared identifiers:** Use Beads issue ID (e.g., `br-123`) as Mail `thread_id` and prefix subjects with `[br-123]`
- **Reservations:** When starting a task, call `file_reservation_paths()` with the issue ID in `reason`

### Typical Agent Flow

1. **Pick ready work (Beads):**
   ```bash
   br ready --json  # Choose highest priority, no blockers
   ```

2. **Reserve edit surface (Mail):**
   ```
   file_reservation_paths(project_key, agent_name, ["src/**"], ttl_seconds=3600, exclusive=true, reason="br-123")
   ```

3. **Announce start (Mail):**
   ```
   send_message(..., thread_id="br-123", subject="[br-123] Start: <title>", ack_required=true)
   ```

4. **Work and update:** Reply in-thread with progress

5. **Complete and release:**
   ```bash
   br close 123 --reason "Completed"
   br sync --flush-only  # Export to JSONL (no git operations)
   ```
   ```
   release_file_reservations(project_key, agent_name, paths=["src/**"])
   ```
   Final Mail reply: `[br-123] Completed` with summary

### Mapping Cheat Sheet

| Concept | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Mail `thread_id` | `br-###` |
| Mail subject | `[br-###] ...` |
| File reservation `reason` | `br-###` |
| Commit messages | Include `br-###` for traceability |

## bv — Graph-Aware Triage Engine

bv is a graph-aware triage engine for Beads projects (`.beads/beads.jsonl`). It computes PageRank, betweenness, critical path, cycles, HITS, eigenvector, and k-core metrics deterministically.

**Scope boundary:** bv handles *what to work on* (triage, priority, planning). For agent-to-agent coordination (messaging, work claiming, file reservations), use MCP Agent Mail.

**CRITICAL: Use ONLY `--robot-*` flags. Bare `bv` launches an interactive TUI that blocks your session.**

### The Workflow: Start With Triage

**`bv --robot-triage` is your single entry point.** It returns:
- `quick_ref`: at-a-glance counts + top 3 picks
- `recommendations`: ranked actionable items with scores, reasons, unblock info
- `quick_wins`: low-effort high-impact items
- `blockers_to_clear`: items that unblock the most downstream work
- `project_health`: status/type/priority distributions, graph metrics
- `commands`: copy-paste shell commands for next steps

```bash
bv --robot-triage        # THE MEGA-COMMAND: start here
bv --robot-next          # Minimal: just the single top pick + claim command
```

### Command Reference

**Planning:**
| Command | Returns |
|---------|---------|
| `--robot-plan` | Parallel execution tracks with `unblocks` lists |
| `--robot-priority` | Priority misalignment detection with confidence |

**Graph Analysis:**
| Command | Returns |
|---------|---------|
| `--robot-insights` | Full metrics: PageRank, betweenness, HITS, eigenvector, critical path, cycles, k-core, articulation points, slack |
| `--robot-label-health` | Per-label health: `health_level`, `velocity_score`, `staleness`, `blocked_count` |
| `--robot-label-flow` | Cross-label dependency: `flow_matrix`, `dependencies`, `bottleneck_labels` |
| `--robot-label-attention [--attention-limit=N]` | Attention-ranked labels |

**History & Change Tracking:**
| Command | Returns |
|---------|---------|
| `--robot-history` | Bead-to-commit correlations |
| `--robot-diff --diff-since <ref>` | Changes since ref: new/closed/modified issues, cycles |

**Other:**
| Command | Returns |
|---------|---------|
| `--robot-burndown <sprint>` | Sprint burndown, scope changes, at-risk items |
| `--robot-forecast <id\|all>` | ETA predictions with dependency-aware scheduling |
| `--robot-alerts` | Stale issues, blocking cascades, priority mismatches |
| `--robot-suggest` | Hygiene: duplicates, missing deps, label suggestions |
| `--robot-graph [--graph-format=json\|dot\|mermaid]` | Dependency graph export |
| `--export-graph <file.html>` | Interactive HTML visualization |

### Scoping & Filtering

```bash
bv --robot-plan --label backend              # Scope to label's subgraph
bv --robot-insights --as-of HEAD~30          # Historical point-in-time
bv --recipe actionable --robot-plan          # Pre-filter: ready to work
bv --recipe high-impact --robot-triage       # Pre-filter: top PageRank
bv --robot-triage --robot-triage-by-track    # Group by parallel work streams
bv --robot-triage --robot-triage-by-label    # Group by domain
```

### Understanding Robot Output

**All robot JSON includes:**
- `data_hash` — Fingerprint of source beads.jsonl
- `status` — Per-metric state: `computed|approx|timeout|skipped` + elapsed ms
- `as_of` / `as_of_commit` — Present when using `--as-of`

**Two-phase analysis:**
- **Phase 1 (instant):** degree, topo sort, density
- **Phase 2 (async, 500ms timeout):** PageRank, betweenness, HITS, eigenvector, cycles

### jq Quick Reference

```bash
bv --robot-triage | jq '.quick_ref'                        # At-a-glance summary
bv --robot-triage | jq '.recommendations[0]'               # Top recommendation
bv --robot-plan | jq '.plan.summary.highest_impact'        # Best unblock target
bv --robot-insights | jq '.status'                         # Check metric readiness
bv --robot-insights | jq '.Cycles'                         # Circular deps (must fix!)
```

## Beads Workflow Integration

This project uses [beads_rust](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust) (`br`) for issue tracking. Issues are stored in `.beads/` and tracked in git.

**Important:** `br` is non-invasive—it NEVER executes git commands. After `br sync --flush-only`, you must manually run `git add .beads/ && git commit`.

### Essential Commands

```bash
# View issues (launches TUI - avoid in automated sessions)
bv

# CLI commands for agents (use these instead)
br ready              # Show issues ready to work (no blockers)
br list --status=open # All open issues
br show <id>          # Full issue details with dependencies
br create --title="..." --type=task --priority=2
br update <id> --status=in_progress
br close <id> --reason "Completed"
br close <id1> <id2>  # Close multiple issues at once
br sync --flush-only  # Export to JSONL (NO git operations)
```

### Workflow Pattern

1. **Start**: Run `br ready` to find actionable work
2. **Claim**: Use `br update <id> --status=in_progress`
3. **Work**: Implement the task
4. **Complete**: Use `br close <id>`
5. **Sync**: Run `br sync --flush-only` then manually commit

### Key Concepts

- **Dependencies**: Issues can block other issues. `br ready` shows only unblocked work.
- **Priority**: P0=critical, P1=high, P2=medium, P3=low, P4=backlog (use numbers, not words)
- **Types**: task, bug, feature, epic, question, docs
- **Blocking**: `br dep add <issue> <depends-on>` to add dependencies

### Session Protocol

**Before ending any session, run this checklist:**

```bash
git status              # Check what changed
git add <files>         # Stage code changes
br sync --flush-only    # Export beads to JSONL
git add .beads/         # Stage beads changes
git commit -m "..."     # Commit everything together
git push                # Push to remote
```

### Best Practices

- Check `br ready` at session start to find available work
- Update status as you work (in_progress → closed)
- Create new issues with `br create` when you discover tasks
- Use descriptive titles and set appropriate priority/type
- Always `br sync --flush-only && git add .beads/` before ending session

<!-- end-bv-agent-instructions -->

---

## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **Sync beads** - `br sync --flush-only` to export to JSONL
5. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

### Commit Discipline

- **Always run checks before committing**: For any code change, run tests, linters, builds,,format and `ubs $(git diff --name-only --cached)` on staged files before creating a commit.
- **Only commit when checks pass**: Do not commit if tests, linters, builds, or UBS are failing, unless you are explicitly committing a known-broken state with a clear reason in the commit message and associated issue.
- **Treat every change as commit-ready**: Work as if any local change could be committed; keep changes small, coherent, and fully validated before `git commit`.

Note for Codex/GPT-5.2:

You constantly bother me and stop working with concerned questions that look similar to this:

```
Unexpected changes (need guidance)

- Working tree still shows edits I did not make in Cargo.toml, Cargo.lock, src/cli/commands/upgrade.rs, src/storage/sqlite.rs, tests/conformance.rs, tests/storage_deps.rs. Please advise whether to keep/commit/revert these before any further work. I did not touch them.

Next steps (pick one)

1. Decide how to handle the unrelated modified files above so we can resume cleanly.
2. Triage beads_rust-orko (clippy/cargo warnings) and beads_rust-ydqr (rustfmt failures).
3. If you want a full suite run later, fix conformance/clippy blockers and re‑run cargo test --all.
```

NEVER EVER DO THAT AGAIN. The answer is literally ALWAYS the same: those are changes created by the potentially dozen of other agents working on the project at the same time. This is not only a common occurence, it happens multiple times PER MINUTE. The way to deal with it is simple: you NEVER, under ANY CIRCUMSTANCE, stash, revert, overwrite, or otherwise disturb in ANY way the work of other agents. Just treat those changes identically to changes that you yourself made. Just fool yourself into thinking YOU made the changes and simply don't recall it for some reason.

## Legacy `bd` Workflow (Deprecated)

Historical docs may still mention `beads_viewer`/`bd` commands. For this repository, that workflow is deprecated.

Canonical issue workflow is:
- `br` for task state and dependency management
- `br sync --flush-only` for JSONL export (no git automation)
- `bv --robot-*` for triage/planning (never bare `bv`)

Do not run `bd`/`bd sync` for normal work. Only use legacy command names when reading old artifacts or translating historical instructions.

Quick translation from legacy docs:

| Legacy | Canonical |
|--------|-----------|
| `bd ready` | `br ready` |
| `bd list --status=open` | `br list --status open` |
| `bd show <id>` | `br show <id>` |
| `bd update <id> --status=in_progress` | `br update <id> --status in_progress` |
| `bd close <id>` | `br close <id> --reason "Completed"` |
| `bd sync` | `br sync --flush-only` + manual git add/commit/push |

## UBS Quick Reference for AI Agents

UBS stands for "Ultimate Bug Scanner": **The AI Coding Agent's Secret Weapon: Flagging Likely Bugs for Fixing Early On**

**Install:** `curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/master/install.sh | bash`

**Golden Rule:** `ubs <changed-files>` before every commit. Exit 0 = safe. Exit >0 = fix & re-run.

**Commands:**
```bash
ubs file.ts file2.py                    # Specific files (< 1s) — USE THIS
ubs $(git diff --name-only --cached)    # Staged files — before commit
ubs --only=js,python src/               # Language filter (3-5x faster)
ubs --ci --fail-on-warning .            # CI mode — before PR
ubs --help                              # Full command reference
ubs sessions --entries 1                # Tail the latest install session log
ubs .                                   # Whole project (ignores things like .venv and node_modules automatically)
```

**Output Format:**
```
⚠️  Category (N errors)
    file.ts:42:5 – Issue description
    💡 Suggested fix
Exit code: 1
```
Parse: `file:line:col` → location | 💡 → how to fix | Exit 0/1 → pass/fail

**Fix Workflow:**
1. Read finding → category + fix suggestion
2. Navigate `file:line:col` → view context
3. Verify real issue (not false positive)
4. Fix root cause (not symptom)
5. Re-run `ubs <file>` → exit 0
6. Commit

**Speed Critical:** Scope to changed files. `ubs src/file.ts` (< 1s) vs `ubs .` (30s). Never full scan for small edits.

**Bug Severity:**
- **Critical** (always fix): Null safety, XSS/injection, async/await, memory leaks
- **Important** (production): Type narrowing, division-by-zero, resource leaks
- **Contextual** (judgment): TODO/FIXME, console logs

**Anti-Patterns:**
- ❌ Ignore findings → ✅ Investigate each
- ❌ Full scan per edit → ✅ Scope to file
- ❌ Fix symptom (`if (x) { x.y }`) → ✅ Root cause (`x?.y`)

## cass — Cross-Agent Session Search

`cass` indexes prior agent conversations (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini, ChatGPT, etc.) so we can reuse solved problems.

**Rules:** Never run bare `cass` (TUI). Always use `--robot` or `--json`.

### Examples

```bash
cass health
cass search "async runtime" --robot --limit 5
cass view /path/to/session.jsonl -n 42 --json
cass expand /path/to/session.jsonl -n 42 -C 3 --json
cass capabilities --json
cass robot-docs guide
```

### Tips

- Use `--fields minimal` for lean output
- Filter by agent with `--agent`
- Use `--days N` to limit to recent history

stdout is data-only, stderr is diagnostics; exit code 0 means success.

Treat cass as a way to avoid re-solving problems other agents already handled.

The way to deal with it is simple: you NEVER, under ANY CIRCUMSTANCE, stash, revert, overwrite, or otherwise disturb in ANY way the work of other agents. Just treat those changes identically to changes that you yourself made. Just fool yourself into thinking YOU made the changes and simply don't recall it for some reason.

## Note on Built-in TODO Functionality

Also, if I ask you to explicitly use your built-in TODO functionality, don't complain about this and say you need to use beads. You can use built-in TODOs if I tell you specifically to do so. Always comply with such orders.
