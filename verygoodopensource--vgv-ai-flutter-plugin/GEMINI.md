# VGV AI Flutter Plugin

## Project Overview

VGV AI Flutter Plugin provides best-practices skills for Flutter and Dart development. It is a **documentation-only repository** — there is no Dart/Flutter source code, no `pubspec.yaml`, and no tests. All value lives in the markdown skill files.

## Skill File Format

Every `SKILL.md` follows this structure:

1. **YAML frontmatter** with the following fields:
   - `name` _(required)_ — must match the skill's folder name exactly; lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only (e.g., `bloc`)
   - `description` _(required)_ — when the skill should be triggered
   - `allowed-tools` _(optional)_ — space-separated list of tools the skill may use (e.g., `Read Glob Grep`)
   - `argument-hint` _(optional)_ — placeholder hint shown to the user (e.g., `"[file-or-directory]"`)
2. **H1 title** — human-readable skill name
3. **Core Standards** — enforced constraints, always first
4. **Content sections** — architecture, code examples, workflows, anti-patterns

Every skill also ships a Codex sidecar at `agents/openai.yaml` beside its `SKILL.md`, holding the skill-picker metadata `interface.display_name` and `interface.short_description`. Every skill in this plugin is **model-invoked** (the model may auto-activate it), so no skill sets `disable-model-invocation` or a Codex `policy` block; a user-invoked-only skill would set both, kept in sync. See `CONTRIBUTING.md` → Cross-harness portability.

## Writing Conventions

- Frame standards as clear directives — no soft language ("consider", "prefer")
- Use fenced code blocks with language identifiers for all examples
- Provide complete, copy-pasteable snippets, not fragments
- Reference packages by full name (e.g., `package:mocktail`)
- Include anti-patterns alongside correct patterns when helpful
- Align pipe characters vertically in all markdown tables (enforced by markdownlint MD060)

## Adding a New Skill

1. Create `skills/<skill_name>/SKILL.md` following the format above, plus the Codex sidecar
   `skills/<skill_name>/agents/openai.yaml` (`interface.display_name` + `interface.short_description`)
2. Create `evals/tests/<skill_name>.yaml` — eval cases with one prompt per major
   workflow the skill covers, a `skill-used` assertion on each, and one
   `not-skill-used` negative control. Routing assertions carry `weight: 3` so a routing
   miss cannot clear the per-case threshold. Register the file under `tests:` in
   `evals/promptfooconfig.yaml`. See `evals/README.md` for the format
3. Update `keywords` **and** the `description` (marketplace text) in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
4. Update the skills table in `README.md` (skill name must link to the `SKILL.md` file)
5. Add the skill's slash command (e.g., `/<skill-name>`) to the **Usage** list in `README.md`
6. Add any new domain terms to the `words` list in `config/cspell.json`
7. Update the repository structure in `AGENTS.md`

## Adding a New Agent

Agents are subagents that Claude Code dispatches as isolated, specialized helpers (e.g., reviewers).
They live in `agents/<name>.md` at the plugin root and are **auto-discovered** — unlike skills, no
`.claude-plugin/plugin.json` change is required. An `agents/<name>.md` file registers as
`vgv-ai-flutter-plugin:<name>`.

1. Create `agents/<agent_name>.md` with YAML frontmatter:
   - `name` _(required)_ — must match the file name; lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only
   - `description` _(required)_ — when Claude should dispatch the agent
   - `tools` _(optional)_ — comma-separated bare tool names. The `tools` field cannot scope Bash by
     command; for a read-only agent, omit write tools (`Edit`, `Write`, `NotebookEdit`) and restrict
     Bash with an agent-scoped PreToolUse hook (see `flutter-reviewer.md`)
   - `skills` _(optional)_ — bare skill names to preload at startup (full skill content is injected)
   - `model` _(optional)_ — `inherit` to use the session model
   - `hooks` _(optional)_ — agent-scoped hooks, e.g. a PreToolUse `Bash` hook
2. Add an **Agents** table row in `README.md` (agent name links to the `agents/<name>.md` file)
3. Add any new domain terms to the `words` list in `config/cspell.json`
4. Update the repository structure in `AGENTS.md`

## Maintaining Existing Skills, Hooks, and MCP Tools

Most documentation drift comes from changing existing assets without updating the
docs that describe them. When you touch any of the following, update the matching
documentation in the same change:

- **Updating a skill's scope or description** — update the matching row in the
  `README.md` skills table and the `interface.short_description` in the skill's
  `agents/openai.yaml`, so all three stay in sync. Nothing checks them against
  each other. `description` also carries every trigger phrase and is capped at
  1024 characters, which `validate-skill` enforces as an error. Keep it to
  triggers and scope, leaving pure teaching material to the body. Do not cut a
  sentence just because the body repeats it — routing happens before the body
  loads — and re-run the skill's eval cases after any trim.
- **Changing what a skill teaches** — run the skill's eval cases to confirm the new
  guidance actually lands in the model's output, and update any case that asserted
  the old behavior. A failing case after a deliberate change means the case needs
  updating; a failing case after a Claude Code or MCP server change means the skill
  does.
- **Restructuring a skill's reference files** (`reference.md` ↔ `references/`) —
  update the repository structure block in `AGENTS.md` to match the new layout, and
  update every markdown link pointing at the moved file. Nothing checks these links
  automatically, so verify each one by hand.
- **Adding or changing a hook** in `hooks/hooks.json` — update the **Hooks**
  section in `README.md` (and the `## Hooks` section in `CLAUDE.md` if behavior
  changes).
- **Adding or changing an MCP tool** — update the **MCP Integration** tools table
  in `README.md`, and check whether any skill's `allowed-tools` names a tool that
  was renamed or removed. Nothing validates those names.

## Evals

Evals ask whether Claude routes to a skill and follows it. `evals/README.md` is the
single source of truth for the case format, the assertion reference, prerequisites,
and what makes a case worth having — read it before writing a case, and put new eval
documentation there rather than here.

[promptfoo](https://www.promptfoo.dev) over the Claude Agent SDK; config
`evals/promptfooconfig.yaml`, cases `evals/tests/<skill>.yaml`. Run with
`npx promptfoo@latest eval -c evals/promptfooconfig.yaml`. Uses the local Claude
Code session, so no API key. Read the per-column split, not the total: the
`sealed-baseline` column is supposed to fail.

Run them by hand before opening a PR. They do **not** run on a pull request, because they
call real models; `.github/workflows/evals.yaml` runs them after a merge to `main`, scoped
to the changed skills, `with-skill` column only, and always non-blocking. A full run is
manual (`workflow_dispatch`) and is the expensive one.

Isolation between the two columns is held by the provider keys in `promptfooconfig.yaml`
and nothing checks it automatically, so treat any change to `tools`, `working_dir`,
`setting_sources` or `plugins` as invalidating earlier numbers.

## Commits

Use conventional commits: `type(scope): description`

Examples: `feat: add bloc skill`, `chore: add logo to README`
