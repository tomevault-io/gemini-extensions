# The Development Workflow

This document outlines the standard, iterative process for all development work. Following this workflow is **mandatory** to ensure consistency, quality, and effective collaboration across the project.

## The Core Development Loop

All work, from new features to bug fixes, follows this fundamental three-phase cycle:

**REMEMBER: This repository uses `main` as the default branch. NEVER commit directly to `main`!**

1.  **Phase 1: Planning & Alignment**
    -   Select an issue from the backlog.
    -   Switch to the `main` branch and pull the latest changes.
    -   **Create a dedicated feature branch from `main`** (NEVER work directly on `main`).
    -   Explore the codebase to create a detailed implementation strategy.

2.  **Phase 2: Iterative Implementation**
    -   **Log your plan first.** Document your intended changes in the relevant issue *before* writing code.
    -   Implement the changes, adhering to the project's architectural guidelines.
    -   Continuously log progress, discoveries, and setbacks as you work to create a rich history of the task.

3.  **Phase 3: Finalization & Committing**
    -   Write and pass all required tests.
    -   Format your code according to project standards.
    -   Update any relevant project rules based on your changes.
    -   Commit your work using a structured, conventional commit message.
    -   Push your branch and create a PR.

## Phase 1: Planning & Alignment

Before writing a single line of implementation code, you must have a clear plan and be working on the correct branch.

### 1.1. Select an Issue & State Your Intent

1.  **List Open Issues:** Use `mcp_github_list_issues` to see available tasks for `giantswarm/mcp-debug`.
2.  **Choose an Issue:** Select the highest-priority issue you are able to work on.
3.  **Get Details:** Use `mcp_github_get_issue` to retrieve its full details.
4.  **Announce Your Plan:** In the chat, you **MUST** summarize the issue (title, number) and your intended high-level approach.
    -   **Example:** *"I am starting work on issue #37: Refactor Capability API. My plan is to start by defining the new interfaces in the API package..."*

### 1.2. Create a Dedicated Git Branch

**CRITICAL: NEVER COMMIT DIRECTLY TO THE `main` BRANCH!**

The repository uses `main` as the default branch (NOT `master`). All work MUST be done in feature branches.

1.  **Check Your Current Branch:** Run `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`.
2.  **STOP if on `main`:** If you are on `main`, you MUST create a new branch immediately. DO NOT make any commits to `main`.
3.  **Branch Naming Convention:** Branch names **MUST** follow this format:
    > `<type>/issue-<number>-<kebab-case-title>`
4.  **Branch Types:** `feature`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `chore`.
5.  **Example:** `git checkout -b feature/issue-42-add-prometheus-provider`

**Workflow Summary:**
- Always switch to `main` and pull latest changes first
- Always create a branch from `main`
- Make all commits to your feature branch
- Push your branch and create a Pull Request
- Merge to `main` only via Pull Request
- NEVER `git commit` while on `main`
- NEVER `git push origin main`

### 1.3. Explore and Plan

This is a critical step to ensure your implementation is well-considered.

1.  **Explore the Codebase:** Identify the specific files, functions, and lines of code that need to be added, removed, or changed.
2.  **Formulate a Detailed Plan:** Based on your exploration, create a precise implementation plan. What is the exact diff you intend to apply? What potential challenges do you foresee? This plan will be logged in the next step.

---

## Phase 2: Iterative Implementation & Logging

This cycle is the heart of the workflow. It's designed to build a rich, contextual history of the implementation, which is invaluable for debugging, collaboration, and future reference.

### 2.1. Log Your Plan *Before* Coding

1.  Before you start implementing, log the detailed plan you created in step 1.3.
2.  Always update the description of the existing issue with your plan.
3.  Verify that the plan was successfully logged by viewing the issue details again.

### 2.2. Implement & Log Progress

1.  **Set Issue Status:** Mark the issue as `in-progress`.
2.  **Write Code:** Begin writing code according to your plan and the project's [architecture.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/architecture.mdc).
3.  **Log Continuously:** As you work, you will learn things. **You must log them.** Regularly update the issue to append new findings.
    -   **What Worked:** Confirmed approaches, "fundamental truths."
    -   **What Didn't Work:** Dead ends, failed experiments, and why.
    -   **Specifics:** Successful code snippets, configurations, or commands.
    -   **Decisions:** Any choices made, especially if confirmed with the user.

## Phase 3: Finalization & Committing

### 3.1. Pre-Commit Quality Check

Before **every** commit, you **MUST** perform these checks:

1.  **Format Code:**
    ```bash
    goimports -w .
    go fmt ./...
    ```

2.  **Lint Code:**
    ```bash
    make lint
    ```
    -   **CRITICAL:** Fix ALL linter errors before committing.
    -   Linter failures in CI will block your PR from being merged.

3.  **Run All Tests:**
    ```bash
    make test
    ```
    -   **DO NOT** commit if any tests are failing. Fix the tests first.
    -   Code must meet the test coverage minimums defined in [architecture.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/architecture.mdc).

4.  **Update TUI Snapshots (if applicable):**
    -   If you made changes to the TUI, update the golden files: `NO_COLOR=true go test ./internal/tui/view/... -update`.
    -   Review the changes to ensure they are intentional.

### 3.2. Review & Update Rules

1.  Review your implementation and the chat history.
2.  Identify any new patterns, conventions, or best practices that emerged.
3.  Update existing rules in `.cursor/rules/` if you discovered new patterns that should be followed. This is a critical step for our collective improvement.

### 3.3. Craft the Commit Message

Commit messages are vital documentation. They **MUST** follow the [Conventional Commits](mdc:https:/www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0) specification.

**Structure:**
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```
-   **Type:** `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `chore`, `style`, `perf`, `ci`, `build`.
-   **Scope (Optional):** The area of the codebase affected (e.g., `api`, `tui`, `capability`).
-   **Subject:** A short, imperative-tense summary. No period at the end.
-   **Body (Recommended):** Explain the *what* and *why* of the change.
-   **Footer:** Reference the issue being closed using `Closes #<issue_number>`. This automatically links the commit to the issue and closes it. Include `BREAKING CHANGE:` for any backward-incompatible changes.

**Example:**
```
feat(api): Add GetWorkflow handler

Implement the GetWorkflow function in the API layer to allow services
to retrieve workflow definitions by name. This is a prerequisite
for the workflow execution engine.

Closes #52
```

### 3.4. Commit, Push, and Create Pull Request

**VERIFICATION: Before committing, ensure you are NOT on the `main` branch!**

1.  **Verify Branch:** Run `git branch --show-current` - it MUST NOT be `main`

2.  **Commit Changes:**
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "..."
    ```

3.  **Never Amend Commits**: Amend is very difficult to handle with multiple people and with gitops. So avoid using this.

4.  **Push Branch:**
    ```bash
    git push -u origin <your-branch-name>
    ```

5.  **Create Pull Request:** Use `gh pr create` to create a PR targeting the `main` branch.

6.  **Mark Issue Done:** Set the task status to `done`.

7.  **Announce Completion:** Inform the user that your changes have been pushed to a branch and a PR has been created.

### 3.5. Monitor CI Checks (MANDATORY)

After creating a PR or pushing new commits to an existing PR, you **MUST** actively monitor the CI checks:

1.  **Wait for Checks to Start:**
    ```bash
    # Wait 20-30 seconds for checks to initialize
    sleep 20
    gh pr checks
    ```

2.  **Monitor Until All Checks Pass:**
    - **DO NOT** walk away after pushing.
    - Check status every 30-60 seconds until all checks complete.
    - Exit code 8 means checks are still running (this is normal).
    - Exit code 1 means checks failed (action required).
    - Exit code 0 means all checks passed (success!).

3.  **If Checks Fail - Immediate Action Required:**
    ```bash
    # View failed check logs
    gh pr checks
    gh run view <run-id> --log-failed
    ```
    
    **Common Failures:**
    - **Lint failures:** Run `make lint` locally, fix issues, commit, push.
    - **Build failures:** Run `go build ./...` locally, fix, commit, push.
    - **Test failures:** Run `make test` locally, fix, commit, push.

4.  **Fix and Re-push:**
    ```bash
    # Fix the issue locally
    make lint  # or whatever failed
    
    # Commit the fix
    git add .
    git commit -m "fix(ci): resolve <check-name> failure"
    
    # Push and monitor again
    git push
    sleep 20
    gh pr checks
    ```

5.  **Keep Monitoring:** After fixing, continue monitoring until ALL checks are green.

**Why This Matters:**
- Failed CI checks block PR merges.
- Quick fixes prevent blocking other developers.
- Demonstrates professional development practices.
- Ensures code quality before review.

**NEVER:**
- Push and walk away without checking CI.
- Leave failing checks for others to discover.
- Assume checks will pass because local tests passed.
- Wait for PR review before fixing obvious CI failures.

**ALWAYS:**
- Monitor checks immediately after pushing.
- Fix CI failures within minutes, not hours.
- Re-check after every fix until all green.
- Only request review when all checks pass.
