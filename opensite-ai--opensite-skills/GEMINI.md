# OpenSite Agent Skills — Claude Code Context

This `CLAUDE.md` is the root context file for Claude Code sessions in this skills repo.
It covers the memory workflow, available skills, and model routing guidance.

## 🧠 Memory System — Core Workflow

This repo ships a four-skill persistent memory engine. **Use it every session, without
exception.** It is your primary mechanism for maintaining continuity across conversations.

### Session Protocol

```
START OF SESSION         →  /memory-recall
  ↓ (work happens)
END OF SESSION           →  /memory-write
  ↓ (weekly or after bulk writes)
MAINTENANCE              →  /memory-consolidate
```

**Never start non-trivial work without running `/memory-recall` first.** It loads your
working memory handoff, project context, architecture decisions, conventions, and recent
session history before a single line of code is touched.

**Never end a session without running `/memory-write`.** It extracts decisions, facts,
and outcomes from the conversation and writes them to the correct memory layer so the
next session can pick up exactly where this one left off.

### Memory Skills

| Skill | Role | Invoke When |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `memory` | Core store — schema, scripts, direct read/write/search | Anytime you need raw memory access |
| `memory-recall` | Context retrieval — loads all relevant history before work | **Every session start** / "do you remember" |
| `memory-write` | Session capture — extracts and persists session learnings | **Every session end** / "save this" / "remember this" |
| `memory-consolidate` | Maintenance — decay, dedup, compress old sessions | Weekly or after bulk writes |

### Memory Layers

| Layer | Path | What Goes Here |
|-------|------|----------------|
| Episodic | `memory/store/episodic/` | Session summaries, milestones, breakthroughs |
| Semantic | `memory/store/semantic/` | Project facts, tech notes, user preferences, domain knowledge |
| Procedural | `memory/store/procedural/` | ADRs, workflows, code conventions |
| Working | `memory/store/working/active.md` | Hot context handoff between sessions |

### Inline Memory Commands

You can also trigger memory operations mid-session:

```
"save this"              →  /memory-write   (captures current conversation state)
"remember this"          →  /memory-write
"do you remember X?"     →  /memory-recall  (targeted recall for X)
"store to memory"        →  /memory-write
```

### What to Write

**Always write:**
- Architecture decisions with rationale (ADRs) — even small ones
- Non-trivial bugs: root cause + fix + why it happened
- New file paths, data models, or API contracts established in this session
- User preferences expressed explicitly ("always use X over Y")
- Repeatable workflows or processes established this session

**Write selectively:**
- Technology facts (version numbers, library gotchas, confirmed behaviors)
- Project-specific knowledge that won't be obvious from the code

**Never write:**
- Trivial edits (typo fixes, formatting)
- Facts already in the codebase and easily found by grep
- Duplicates — always run `search_memory.py` before writing

### Data Privacy

The memory store (`memory/store/`) is gitignored and lives only on this machine. It is
never committed. Only the skill instruction files and Python scripts are versioned.

## Available Skills

Skills are available in `.claude/skills/`. Load with `/skill-name` or let Claude trigger
them automatically based on context.

### Memory (Core — Use Every Session)

| Skill | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|
| `memory-recall` | **Start of every session** — loads full context before work begins |
| `memory-write` | **End of every session** — persists decisions, facts, and outcomes |
| `memory` | Direct memory store access — search, read, or write entries manually |
| `memory-consolidate` | Weekly maintenance — decay, dedup, compress old sessions |

### Context Management

| Skill | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|
| `context-management` | Long sessions, large tool outputs, after compaction, context window running low. FTS5 indexing, BM25 search, output compression, session checkpointing. |

### Rust + Axum

| Skill | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|
| `octane-rust-axum` | Axum routes, handlers, middleware, and service patterns |
| `octane-soc2-hipaa` | Compliance, audit logging, PHI handling |
| `octane-llm-engine` | Self-hosted LLM service (vLLM, Llama, routing traits) |
| `octane-embedding-pipeline` | BGE-M3, Qwen3, Milvus vector search |

### Frontend

| Skill | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|
| `opensite-ui-components` | Component library development |
| `tailwind4-shadcn` | Tailwind v4 config, ShadCN customization, theming |
| `page-speed-library` | `@page-speed/*` sub-library development |
| `semantic-ui-builder` | AI-powered site builder patterns |

### Backend

| Skill | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|
| `rails-api-patterns` | Rails API design, service layer, and background job patterns |
| `deploy-fly-io` | Fly.io deployments, Tigris, GPU machines |
| `sentry-monitoring` | Error tracking integration across services |
| `git-workflow` | Branch naming, commits, PRs, CI conventions |

## Model Routing Guide

| Task | Model | Why |
|------|-------|-----|
| Deep research, analysis, architecture review | Opus 4.6 | 1M context, strong reasoning, web search |
| Report generation, structured output | Sonnet 4.6 | Near-Opus performance, 5× cheaper |
| Security audits, high-stakes decisions | Opus 4.6 | Deep reasoning required |
| Standard coding — bug fixes, features | Sonnet 4.6 | Near-parity for most coding tasks |
| Self-hosted inference | Llama 3.3 70B | SOC2/HIPAA compliant, low cost |

## Cloud Skill Sync

Skills in this repo are the source of truth. Claude Code reads them via symlinks
(changes are instant). Cloud platforms require a re-upload after edits:

```bash
./sync-perplexity.sh    # Perplexity Computer — perplexity.ai/account/org/skills
./sync-claude.sh        # Claude Desktop     — claude.ai/customize/skills
```

Both scripts open a **visible Brave browser window** and automate the upload UI.
Credentials live in `.env` (gitignored):

```bash
PERPLEXITY_SESSION_COOKIE=...   # from perplexity.ai cookies: __Secure-next-auth.session-token
CLAUDE_SESSION_COOKIE=...       # from claude.ai cookies: sessionKey
```

**Important implementation notes (do not regress):**

- Both scripts use the real Brave binary (`/Applications/Brave Browser.app`) in headed
  (visible) mode — Playwright's bundled headless Chromium is detected and blocked by
  Cloudflare on both sites
- File upload uses Playwright's `filechooser` event interception after clicking the
  upload zone — directly setting `input.files` via the DOM does not trigger React's
  `onChange` and silently fails
- Both scripts create a fresh browser context (not your existing Brave profile) and
  inject only the session cookie

**Update strategies differ between platforms:**

- **Perplexity** (`sync-perplexity.sh`): searches the skill list first; if found, opens
  the skill's `⋮` menu and clicks the update option; if not found, clicks "Upload skill".
  Drop-zone element: `div[role="button"]` with text "Drag your file here or click to upload".
- **Claude** (`sync-claude.sh`): always runs the same "new skill" flow (`+` button →
  "Upload a skill"); if the skill exists Claude shows "Replace [name] skill?" — the script
  clicks "Upload and replace". No search or `⋮` menu needed.
  Drop-zone element: `<button>` with text "Drag and drop or click to upload".
