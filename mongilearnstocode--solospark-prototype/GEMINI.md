## 5. Key Design Features
SoloSpark’s interface is modern and responsive, with subtle enhancements that boost usability without compromising speed (Frontend Guidelines and UI Prototype Prompt):

- **Minimal Card Shadows**: Soft shadows (0, 2px, 4px, rgba(0,0,0,0.1)) for depth (UI Prototype Prompt), styled via Tailwind CSS.
- **Rounded Corners**: 8px border-radius on buttons, cards, and inputs (UI Prototype Prompt), creating an approachable feel.
- **Micro-Interactions**:
  - Button hovers scale to 1.05x (UI Prototype Prompt).
  - Fade-in alerts (e.g., “Post Scheduled!”) and smooth drag-and-drop transitions (PRD’s visual calendar), powered by Framer Motion with 300ms durations (Frontend Guidelines).
- **Icon Style**: Outline-based Heroicons (Technical Stack Overview), filled for active states, ensuring clarity (UI Prototype Prompt).
- **Glassmorphism for Modals**: Frosted-glass effect (backdrop-blur) for popups like the post editor (UI Prototype Prompt), implemented via Tailwind.
- **Motion**: Subtle animations (max 300ms) to avoid distraction (Frontend Guidelines), enhancing the PRD’s focus on efficiency.

## 6. Grid & Layout System
SoloSpark’s responsive grid ensures consistency and adaptability, aligning with the UI Prototype Prompt’s layout guidelines and Frontend Guidelines’ Tailwind integration.

- **Breakpoints**:
  - Mobile: <768px — Single-column, full-width cards, stacked navigation (PRD’s mobile-first focus).
  - Tablet: 768–1024px — Dual-column, compact views, collapsed sidebar (UI Prototype Prompt).
  - Desktop: >1024px — Multi-column dashboard, persistent sidebar, expanded calendar (UI Prototype Prompt).
- **Spacing System**:
  - Base Unit: 8px, aligning with Tailwind’s scale (Frontend Guidelines, UI Prototype Prompt).
  - Scale: 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px, 40px for margins, paddings, gaps.
  - Implementation: CSS variables (e.g., `--spacing-1: 8px`) or Tailwind classes (e.g., `p-2`, `m-4`) (Frontend Guidelines).
  - Examples:
    - Card padding: 16px (2x base).
    - Section gaps: 24px (3x base).
    - Margins: 8px (1x base).
- **Grid**:
  - 12-column grid with 16px gutters (UI Prototype Prompt).
  - Max width: 1280px (desktop), centered (UI Prototype Prompt).
  - Mobile: Full-width with 16px side padding for breathing room.

## Alignment with PRD
SoloSpark’s design system directly supports the PRD’s goals and user needs:

- **Purpose**: Saves time and boosts confidence with a clear, fast interface (PRD Objectives). The warm tone and intuitive layout make every action effortless.
- **Audience**: Tailored for the “solo chaos gremlin,” the mobile-first design and bold CTAs cater to their sporadic, multitasking habits (PRD User Persona).
- **User Journeys**:
  - “Post Once, Tweak Everywhere”: The post editor’s platform toggles and previews streamline multi-platform posting (PRD Workflow).
  - Visual Calendar: Drag-and-drop simplicity via Framer Motion supports quick scheduling (PRD Core Features).
  - Analytics: Tweet-sized insights (e.g., “Your post doubled your reach!”) deliver instant wins (PRD Basic Analytics).
