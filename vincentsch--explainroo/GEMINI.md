# explainroo for coding agents

This file tells you, the coding agent, how to make a video with explainroo.
The user usually gives you a topic, and maybe a length or a style. You write
the words and the pictures. explainroo makes the video.

explainroo turns two files into an MP4 video with narration. `script.md`
holds what the voice says. `scenes.js` draws what the viewer sees. Every
drawing can appear on a word the voice says. A voice model (Kokoro) reads the
script on this computer. Whisper listens to the recording and writes down
when each word is spoken. Chrome draws the frames in the background.
explainroo adds music and sound effects, and ffmpeg makes the MP4. You need
no API key unless the user wants AI images.

The full documentation for people is at https://www.explainroo.com/docs/.

## Before you start

Maybe the user pasted the prompt from the README or from explainroo.com, and
you are not in an explainroo folder yet. Then clone it into the current
folder first. If the user named another place, use that.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vincentsch/explainroo.git
cd explainroo
```

Run this once in the explainroo folder:

```bash
npm install
node bin/explainroo.js doctor --fetch
```

`doctor` checks Node, ffmpeg and Chrome. It also downloads the speech models,
about 400 MB, the first time only. If the user ran `npm link`, you can write
`explainroo` instead of `node bin/explainroo.js` in the commands below. Every
command takes the project folder first and accepts `--json`.

### When to ask the user

Decide the normal things yourself, like the look, the length, the voice, the
layout and the wording. Ask only when you cannot go on without an answer.
When you ask, put everything you need in one message. Typical reasons to ask:

- The topic is unclear, or you need a fact you cannot check.
- The user wants AI images and there is no OpenRouter key (see Images).
- The user wants something explainroo cannot do, like video shot with a
  camera.

## Making a video, step by step

1. **Learn the subject.** Read the code, docs or pages the user points to.
   Write down the facts you will use. Never make up numbers, quotes or claims.
   If a number matters and you cannot check it, leave it out.

2. **Create the project.**

   ```bash
   node bin/explainroo.js init videos/<name> --theme paper --title "..."
   ```

   Projects go in `videos/`. Git ignores that folder. Pick the look that fits
   the audience: `paper` (friendly, hand drawn, the default), `clean`
   (products and business), `chalk` (teaching), `blueprint` (engineering) or
   `midnight` (developer tools). Pick the size for the place the video goes,
   for example `--size tiktok` or `--size linkedin`. The sizes are listed in
   "Sizes for each platform" below. Add `--pace 1.2` when the user wants a
   quicker video.

3. **Write `script.md`.** The narration comes first. It sets the timing for
   everything else. See "How to write the narration" below.

4. **Make the voice.**

   ```bash
   node bin/explainroo.js voice videos/<name>
   ```

   The command prints how long each scene is and how many words the speech
   check confirmed. If a word is not confirmed, the voice probably said it
   wrong. Fix it with `{shown|spoken}` in the script and run the command
   again. Only the scenes you changed are made again.

5. **Plan the pictures.** For each scene, decide what is on screen when each
   marker or important word is spoken. Decide where each thing sits and what
   leaves the screen. Keep things in the same place from scene to scene.

6. **Make images, if the video needs them.** Icons and diagrams cover most
   technical topics. Everyday how-to topics like cooking, cars or gardening
   work better with pictures. See "Images" below.

7. **Write `scenes.js`.** Write one function per scene. Tie every picture to
   the narration with `at: 'word'` or `at: '#marker'`. The scene API is at
   the end of this file.

8. **Check.**

   ```bash
   node bin/explainroo.js check videos/<name>
   ```

   Fix every error and every warning. You decide what to do with the hints.

9. **Look at the frames.** You cannot watch the video, so this is how you see
   it.

   ```bash
   node bin/explainroo.js still videos/<name>                 # the end of each scene
   node bin/explainroo.js still videos/<name> intro@2.5 12.0  # any moment
   node bin/explainroo.js sheet videos/<name> --scene intro   # one scene over time
   node bin/explainroo.js sheet videos/<name>                 # the whole video
   ```

   Open the images and judge them like a viewer would. Is the text big
   enough? Is anything cut off or on top of something else? Is half the frame
   empty? Does the sheet show something new every few seconds? Fix what is
   wrong and look again.

10. **Make the video and check the file.**

    ```bash
    node bin/explainroo.js render videos/<name> --draft   # quick half-size version
    node bin/explainroo.js render videos/<name>           # final video
    node bin/explainroo.js verify videos/<name>
    ```

    `render` makes the video. `verify` measures the loudness and looks for
    black frames and silence. It also runs the speech check on the finished
    sound to make sure the voice is still clear over the music.

11. **Tell the user** where `out/video.mp4` is, how long it is, what verify
    said, and what you could not check.

## How to write the narration

Unless the user asks for another style, write the way a person explains
something to a friend at a table.

- Use regular, down-to-earth English and everyday words. Explain things in
  simple terms. If you need a technical word, say what it means the first
  time.
- Keep sentences short, about 8 to 18 words, one idea each.
- Say who does what: "The browser asks a resolver."
- Every sentence adds a fact. Cut half sentences that repeat something.
- Do not use em dashes or dashes between phrases. Use a comma or a new
  sentence.
- Leave out slogans and punchlines ("Just code."), "not X, but Y" twists,
  colon reveals, chains of three short sentences, metaphors, and filler words
  like "just", "simply", "really", "actually" and "exactly".
- Do not tell the viewer to do obvious things ("Let's dive in", "Stay tuned").
- End with a plain sentence that sums up the main point.

Length and pace:

- Aim for 45 to 120 seconds unless the user says otherwise. A finished video
  has about 150 words a minute, pauses included.
- Start with the question or problem. Explain it in small steps. Give one
  concrete example, then sum up.
- One idea per scene, usually 1 to 3 sentences (4 to 15 seconds).
- Lists read aloud ("A, B, C and D") only work when each item appears on
  screen.

Script syntax:

```markdown
# Title of the video

## scene-id {hold=1.5}
Narration for this scene. [#marker] A marker names a moment you can animate on.
[pause 0.6] adds silence. {SQL|sequel} shows "SQL" in captions but says "sequel".
> Lines starting with > are notes for you and are not spoken.
```

- `## scene-id` starts a scene. The id must match a function in `scenes.js`.
- Put a `[#marker]` wherever a picture should change. Every sentence should
  trigger at least one picture.
- Use `{shown|spoken}` for anything the voice may misread: acronyms
  (`{CLI|C L I}`), versions (`{v2.1|version two point one}`), symbols and
  domains (`{example.com|example dot com}`, otherwise the voice says "example
  comm").
- A scene can have these settings in the braces after its id: `hold`
  (seconds after the voice, default 0.7), `min` (the shortest the scene can
  be, in seconds), `lead` (seconds before the voice, default 0.35) and
  `transition` (`fade`, `slide`, `wipe`, `zoom`, `brush`, `cut`).
- A scene without narration lasts `min` seconds (default 3).

## What makes the pictures good

- **Show it when it is said.** A picture appears as the voice mentions it.
  Use word cues.
- **Something changes every 2 to 4 seconds.** A new element, an arrow, a
  highlight or a camera move. `check` points out long stretches where nothing
  moves.
- **Short screen text.** Labels, numbers and key phrases of a few words. The
  whole narration never goes on screen. When the narration should be readable,
  turn on captions (`"captions": true`). Then do not also show the sentence
  the voice is saying as text.
- **Few things at once.** At most five or six elements. Take things off the
  screen with `out` before the next idea.
- **Big and readable.** Titles 80 to 110 px, labels 40 to 56 px, small text
  at least 32 px on a 1920 x 1080 canvas. Stay inside `s.safe`.
- **Same meaning, same color.** Give each thing one color and one place and
  keep them. Use the accent color for the one thing that matters most.
- **Real examples.** A command you can run, a number with its source or a
  picture of the real screen is better than three boxes with general words.
- **A clear last frame** that shows the main point.

## Images

explainroo can make illustrations with AI image models through OpenRouter.
This is optional. It costs money on the user's OpenRouter account, roughly 7
to 13 cents per image at the time of writing.

If the user wants images and there is no key, ask them for an OpenRouter API
key (from openrouter.ai/keys). Save it in a `.env` file in the explainroo
folder as `OPENROUTER_API_KEY=...`, or set it as an environment variable. Git
ignores `.env`. Never print the key, and never put it in a script, a commit
or a log.

```bash
node bin/explainroo.js image videos/<name> cables "Two cars parked nose to nose with their hoods open, jumper cables between the batteries"
node bin/explainroo.js images videos/<name>    # what was made and what it cost
```

This saves `assets/cables.png`. Use it in a scene with
`s.image('assets/cables.png', { w: 1100, frame: 'card', at: 'cables' })`.

- `--model best` (default) uses OpenAI GPT Image 2. It does what you ask and
  is worth the price for most images.
- `--model cheap` uses Google Gemini 3.1 Flash Image. It costs about half,
  but it often ignores parts of the prompt.
- `--aspect` sets the shape of the image: `16:9` (default for landscape
  videos), `9:16`, `1:1`, `4:3`, `3:2` and their portrait forms.
- `--ref assets/a.png` sends an earlier image along, so a person or object
  keeps the same look. Separate several files with commas.
- Every image gets a default style (flat, soft colors, no text). Set your own
  in `video.json` with `"images": { "style": "...", "model": "best" }`, or
  turn the style off with `--no-style`.

**Always open every image and check it.** Image models get details wrong:
extra fingers, cables on the wrong terminal, text that looks like writing but
is not. If anything is wrong, change the prompt and make the image again.
Keep text out of images. Put words on screen with `s.text` instead. Use
images for things icons cannot show, and keep one style through the whole
video.

## Product demos

A product demo is the kind of video software companies make to show their
app. You rebuild the app's screens with `s.ui`, which has cards, fields,
buttons, dropdowns, toggles and status labels in the app's colors and fonts.
A mouse pointer clicks through the screens and types into the fields, and the
camera zooms in on what the voice talks about. `examples/unspar-demo` is a
complete one.

**Keep it true.** A demo is advertising, so everything in it has to be right.

- Take the wording from the app itself: its templates and language files
  (for example `lang/en/*.php`, `locales/`, or the components). Copy labels,
  buttons and status names exactly.
- Show only features that exist and that customers can use. Leave out admin
  screens, debug views and plans that are not built yet.
- Example data must look like example data: `example.com`, a made up project,
  a made up article title. Never invent customers, numbers or results.
- Claims in the narration come from the product's live website. Show prices
  only if the website shows them.
- Ask the user if the website and the app say different things.

**Set up the brand** in `video.json`. Use the `clean` look.

```json
{
  "theme": "clean",
  "brand": {
    "accent": "#245cff",
    "background": "#f8f6f1",
    "font": "Figtree",
    "headline": "Instrument Serif",
    "logo": "assets/logo.svg"
  },
  "fonts": [
    { "family": "Figtree", "src": "assets/fonts/Figtree-600.woff2", "weight": 600 }
  ]
}
```

- `accent` is the main button color. Find it in the app's Tailwind config or
  CSS. `background` is the color behind the screens, `ink` the color of text
  drawn right on it.
- `font` is the app's font. Inter is built in; other fonts go in
  `assets/fonts/` and in `fonts` (`.woff2`, `.woff`, `.ttf` or `.otf`, one
  entry per weight, or `"weight": "100 900"` for a variable font, and
  `"style": "italic"`). Copy the font's license file next to it.
- `headline` is the font for big headlines. Instrument Serif is built in. If
  the brand has no serif, use its own font and pass `{ weight: 700,
  italic: false }` to `u.headline()`.
- `logo` is the product's logo from the app or website, best as SVG.

**Build a scene** in this order: background, camera, headline, screens,
cursor last so it stays on top.

```js
hook(s) {
  const u = s.ui;
  u.backdrop();
  u.floaters();
  s.camera([{ at: '#site', x: 900, y: 600, zoom: 1.3 }]);
  u.headline('Tell it what to *write about*', s.W / 2, 178, { size: 84, at: 0.15 });
  u.panel(410, 270, 1100, 600, { at: 0.3 }, (x, y, w, h) => {
    u.input(x + 56, y + 296, 560, 62, { label: 'Website URL', value: u.typed('https://example.com', '#site', 24), focus: 1, caret: true });
    u.button('Get ideas', x + 760, y + 516, 280, 60, { press: u.press('#go') });
  });
  u.cursor([
    { at: 0.5, x: 1500, y: 900 },
    { at: s.time('#site') - 0.7, x: 740, y: 596 },
    { at: '#site', click: true },
  ]);
}
```

Draw the headline after `s.camera()`, or the zoomed screens slide under it.
When the camera zooms in, either keep the headline fully in view (zoom up to
about 1.1) or zoom far enough that it leaves the frame (about 1.3 and more).
In between it gets cut in half.

Time every click to a `[#mark]` in the script, so it happens when the voice
says it. A cursor move starts at its `at` and arrives `dur` seconds later
(0.7 by default), so start the move a little more than `dur` before the
click. The first 0.7 seconds of a scene are covered by the transition from
the scene before, so put no clicks there.

The watermark sits in the bottom right corner. When the camera zooms in, it
can cover what is there, so keep important text out of that corner.

Use the product's name as plain text in the first frame. The first frame is
also the video's cover.

**`s.ui` reference.** Positions are in the frame (1920 wide for 16:9). Times
take seconds, spoken words or `"#marks"`, like everywhere else.

| Call | What it draws |
|---|---|
| `u.backdrop(color?)`, `u.floaters({ alpha, tint })` | the brand background, and faint cards drifting around the edges (`tint: 'white'` on a colored background) |
| `u.panel(x, y, w, h, { at, out, from, rise, sfx, fill, border, lift }, fn)` | a card that pops in at `at`; `fn(x, y, w, h)` draws inside it |
| `u.card(x, y, w, h, o)` | a card without an entrance |
| `u.browser(x, y, w, h, { url, at }, fn)` | a panel with a browser bar; `fn` gets the page area |
| `u.modal(x, y, w, h, { at, out }, fn)`, `u.over(fn)` | a dialog over a dimmed frame, and a layer for your own menus or popups; `check` does not report text in one layer as overlapping text in another |
| `u.toast(text, { at, out, icon, tone })` | a message that slides up, with a chime |
| `u.headline(text, x, y, { size, at, out, align, weight, italic, color, accent, tracking })` | big text that blurs in word by word; `*stars*` mark words in the `accent` color |
| `u.text(text, x, y, { size, weight, color, align, base, font, italic, tracking, alpha, maxW, check })`, `u.para(text, x, y, maxW, o)`, `u.eyebrow(text, x, y)` | text, wrapped text (`\n` starts a new line), and a small uppercase label; `font` is `'ui'`, `'headline'` or a family; `check: false` hides text from `check`; `u.measure(text, size, weight)` gives the width |
| `u.button(label, x, y, w, h, { variant, press, icon, loading, color, caps })` | `primary`, `secondary` or `ghost` |
| `u.input(x, y, w, h, { label, value, placeholder, focus, caret, icon })`, `u.textarea(x, y, w, h, o)` | a text field, and a taller one where the text wraps |
| `u.select(x, y, w, h, { label, value, open, options, hover, selected })` | a dropdown; returns the y of each option row |
| `u.toggle(x, y, on)`, `u.checkbox(x, y, on)`, `u.radio(x, y, on)` | `on` goes from 0 to 1, so it can animate |
| `u.chip(label, x, y, { selected })`, `u.chipWidth(label, o, selected)` | option chips; a selected chip grows by its check mark, so leave room |
| `u.pill(label, x, y, tone, { align, dot, pulse })` | a status badge: `gray`, `blue`, `yellow`, `green`, `red`, `purple` or `accent` |
| `u.spinner(x, y, r)`, `u.progress(x, y, w, p)`, `u.avatar(x, y, r, initials, { image })`, `u.icon(name, x, y, size, color)`, `u.lines(x, y, w, n)`, `u.logo(x, y, w)` | small parts; `lines` draws grey bars in place of body text |
| `u.pop(at, cx, cy, fn, { sfx })` | pops anything in around a point |
| `u.wipe(at, { color })` | the accent color spreads out until it fills the frame |
| `u.cursor(keys, { out })` | the mouse; a key `{ at, x, y, dur, arc }` moves it (`arc` bends the path, 0 is straight), `{ at, click: true }` clicks with a sound |
| `u.press(at)`, `u.typed(text, at, cps, { gain, sfx })`, `u.stream(text, at, wps)`, `u.count(to, at, dur)` | a button press (0 to 1 and back), text typed so far with typing sounds, text appearing word by word like an AI reply, a number counting up |
| `u.colors` | `accent`, `accentDark`, `accentTint`, `background`, `ink`, `text`, `soft`, `muted`, `faint`, `line`, `field`, `surface`, `panel`; `brand.colors` in `video.json` replaces the grays, for example `{ "text": "#141413", "line": "#e8e6dc" }` for a warm brand |

`check` sees the text of `s.ui` too. It reports text that runs off the frame
(not while the camera zooms in), text that is too small and text that
overlaps. A dropdown or dialog may cover what is under it. Look at stills at
the moments the camera is zoomed in, and check the cursor does not hide the
word it points at.

Panels and headlines from `s.ui` make no sound unless you pass `sfx`.
`check` does not see clipping: text you hide by clipping still counts, so
do not draw text that should not show. Try a product name with its plain
spelling first; only respell it when the speech check mishears it.

Many sounds under the voice make it hard to follow, and `verify` then
understands less of it. Keep long typing quiet (`u.typed(text, at, cps, {
gain: 0.25 })`) and give each moment one sound, not three.

A blur filter on every frame makes rendering slow. The kit blurs things once
and reuses them. Do the same if you add your own blur.

## Sizes for each platform

Set `size` to the place the video goes. `explainroo formats` lists the sizes.

| Size | Pixels | For |
|---|---|---|
| `youtube` (or `16:9`) | 1920 x 1080 | YouTube and other wide players |
| `shorts` | 1080 x 1920 | YouTube Shorts |
| `tiktok` | 1080 x 1920 | TikTok |
| `reels` | 1080 x 1920 | Instagram and Facebook Reels |
| `vertical` | 1080 x 1920 | one file for Shorts, TikTok and Reels |
| `instagram` | 1080 x 1350 | Instagram and Facebook feed posts |
| `linkedin` | 1080 x 1350 | the LinkedIn feed |
| `square` (or `1:1`) | 1080 x 1080 | square posts on X, LinkedIn and Facebook |

`9:16`, `4:5` and `WIDTHxHEIGHT` also work.

Shorts, TikTok and Reels put their own buttons, the account name and the post
text on top of the video. With `shorts`, `tiktok`, `reels` and `vertical`,
explainroo keeps your content away from those spots. `s.safe` is the part the
app leaves free, and `s.cx` and `s.cy` are its center. The captions sit right
above the app's bottom band, and the watermark moves to the top right corner.
`check` warns about any text outside that area. Plain `9:16` has no such
margins, so use it only when the video is not meant for those apps.

Vertical videos have little room. Stack things instead of putting them side
by side, use fewer words on screen, and place everything from `s.safe`.
`explainroo formats` prints the content area of each size in pixels, for
example 745 x 746 on TikTok.

### Where the captions sit

Captions are on by default for vertical, 4:5 and square videos. On Shorts,
TikTok and Reels they sit right above the app's bottom band. On 4:5, square
and wide videos they sit at the bottom, above the watermark. On a plain
`9:16` video they sit about a quarter of the way up. In every case `s.safe`
ends above them. So anything placed inside `s.safe` stays clear of them, and
`check` warns about text in the caption band. Do not put the same sentence on
screen as text while the captions show it.

The first frame is often the cover picture on social apps. When the first
elements draw themselves in, frame one is empty. Give the title
`enter: 'none'` so it is there from the first frame, or pick another cover
frame in the app.

## Pace

`pace` makes the whole video quicker or slower. At 1.3 the voice speaks 30%
faster. The pauses, the time before and after each scene, the transitions and
every animation also get 30% shorter. Word and marker cues follow the voice.
So if you tie pictures to words, the rhythm stays right at any pace. Times in
seconds are real seconds of the scene, like `s.t` and `s.cue()`. So
`at: s.cue('word') + 0.3` means 0.3 seconds after the word at any pace. A
fixed time like `at: 4` does not move with the pace. That is one more reason
to use cues. 1 is the normal pace. 1.15 to 1.3 suits social media and viewers
who know the topic. Above 1.4 the video gets hard to follow. `speed` changes
only the voice.

## The watermark

Every video gets a small "explainroo.com" in the bottom right corner. On
Shorts, TikTok and Reels it sits in the top right corner, because the app
covers the bottom one. The user can turn it off with `"watermark": false` in
`video.json`, or change it to their own text. If the user asks about it, tell
them it is their choice, and that keeping it helps more people find this free
project.

| `render [project]` | the MP4 (`--draft`, `--from`, `--to`, `--workers`, `--out`) |
| `verify [project]` | checks the finished file: loudness, black frames, silence, clear voice |
| `image [project] <name> "<prompt>"` | makes an illustration with OpenRouter |
| `images [project]` | lists the images and what they cost |
| `voices`, `say "text"` | lists the 28 voices, or makes a sample |
| `themes`, `formats`, `icons <word>` | lists the looks and the sizes, searches the 1,854 icons |
| `doctor` | checks the setup (`--fetch` downloads the speech models) |

## Scene API

Each scene function draws one frame. explainroo calls it for every frame with
a fresh `s`, so everything in the scene depends only on the time. Do not keep
values between calls and do not use timers. Give each element an `at` time,
and the look animates it in. Give it an `out` time, and the look animates it
out.

```js
export default {
  intro(s) {
    s.title('How DNS works', { at: 0 });
    s.icon('globe', { y: 700, at: 'browser' });
  },
};
```

The canvas is 1920 x 1080 for 16:9. It is 1080 x 1920 for the vertical sizes,
1080 x 1080 for square, and 1080 x 1350 for `instagram`, `linkedin` and 4:5.
Positions are in pixels, counted from the top left corner. `x` and `y` are
the center of an element unless the method says otherwise.

### Time

| Member | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `s.t` | seconds since the scene started |
| `s.T` | seconds since the video started |
| `s.dur` | length of the scene in seconds |
| `s.voice` | `{ start, end }` of the narration in the scene |
| `s.words` | the spoken words: `{ text, start, end }` in scene seconds |
| `s.cue(word, n = 1)` | when the n-th time a word or phrase is spoken starts |
| `s.cueEnd(word, n = 1)` | when it ends |
| `s.mark(name)` | the time of a `[#name]` marker |
| `s.time(v)` | turns a number, a word or `"#marker"` into seconds |
| `s.pace` | the video's pace (1 is normal) |
| `s.p(at, dur = 0.6, ease = 'inOut')` | 0 to 1 progress for your own animation |
| `s.since(at)`, `s.between(a, b)` | seconds since a time, or whether now is between two times |
| `s.video` | `{ duration, frames, fps, width, height, scenes }` of the whole video |

Every `at` and `out` accepts seconds (`2.4`), a spoken word (`'resolver'`) or
a marker (`'#ask'`). Word cues ignore case and punctuation. A phrase works
too. A wrong word or marker stops with an error that lists the closest words.

An easing sets how a movement speeds up and slows down. The easing names are
`linear`, `in`, `out`, `inOut`, `outBack`, `outElastic`, `outQuart` and
`inOutSine`. `s.ease.out(p)`, `s.lerp(a, b, p)` and `s.clamp(v, lo, hi)` are
there for your own math.

### Layout

| Member | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `s.W`, `s.H`, `s.cx`, `s.cy` | canvas size and its center (on Shorts, TikTok and Reels the center of `s.safe`) |
| `s.safe` | `{ x, y, w, h, left, top, right, bottom }`: the area for content (a 7% margin, or the part a platform leaves free) |
| `s.row(n, { width, x })` | n x positions spread over a width |
| `s.col(n, { height, y })` | n y positions spread over a height, centered in `s.safe` |
| `s.grid(cols, rows, { x, y, w, h, gap })` | cells `{ x, y, w, h }`, row by row, filling `s.safe` |
| `s.get(id)` | size and position of an element drawn earlier with that `id` |

Most elements return `{ x, y, w, h, left, right, top, bottom }`, so you can
place the next thing below or beside them.

### Options most elements take

| Option | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `at`, `out` | when it appears and when it leaves |
| `enter` | `draw`, `write`, `type`, `words`, `sync`, `pop`, `rise`, `fade`, `zoom`, `drop`, `slide-left`, `slide-right`, `slide-up`, `slide-down`, `none` |
| `exit` | `fade`, `pop`, `rise`, `drop`, `slide-left`, `slide-right`, `none` |
| `dur` | length of the entrance in seconds (shortened by the pace) |
| `outDur` | length of the exit in seconds (0.45) |
| `id` | a name for arrows, `annotate` and `s.get` |
| `color` | a color name (`blue`, `accent`, `ink`, `muted`, ...) or any CSS color |
| `opacity`, `scale`, `rotate` | extra changes, `rotate` in degrees |
| `float` | pixels of slow drift that keeps a still element alive |
| `sfx` | the sound on entrance, or `false` |

In `paper`, `chalk` and `blueprint`, shapes are drawn line by line and text
is written out. In `clean` and `midnight`, shapes pop and text rises. Use
`at: -1` for things that were already on screen in the previous scene. They
are there from the start and make no sound.

### Text

```js
s.title('How DNS works', { at: 0 });                     // display font, 104 px, at 44% height
s.subtitle('the phone book of the internet', { at: 1 }); // 46 px, muted, at 60% height
s.text('Every site has an *address*', { y: 300, size: 64, at: 'address' });
s.note('about 20 ms', { x: 1400, y: 820, at: 3 });        // 32 px, muted
```

`s.text(str, options)` takes these options: `x`, `y`, `size` (48), `font`
(`display`, `body`, `hand`, `mono`), `weight` or `bold: true`, `align`
(`left` means x is the left edge), `valign` (`top` means y is the top),
`maxWidth`, `lineHeight`, `color`, `mark` (color of `*starred*` words), `bg`
(a card behind the text), `padding`, `radius`, `border`. Text can also enter
with `write`, `type` (with `cps`), `words` and `sync`. `sync` shows each word
as the voice says it. Words in `*stars*` get the accent color. `\n` starts a
new line.

### Shapes and arrows

```js
s.box('Resolver', { id: 'res', x: 960, y: 540, icon: 'server', color: 'blue', at: 'resolver' });
s.circle({ id: 'you', x: 400, y: 540, r: 90, label: 'You', at: 0.5 });
s.arrow('you', 'res', { label: 'asks', at: 'asks' });
s.arrow([300, 900], [1600, 900], { bend: 0.3, dashed: true, at: 5 });
s.line([[200, 800], [900, 700]], { color: 'accent', at: 2 });
s.path('M0 0 C 200 -150 400 150 600 0', { x: 660, y: 540, at: 3 });
```

`s.box(label, options)` is a card that fits its label. Options: `w`, `h`,
`minW`, `minH`, `size`, `font`, `icon`, `iconSize`, `iconColor`, `color`
(outline and a light fill), `fill`, `stroke`, `width`, `dashed`,
`border: false`, `radius`, `shape: 'ellipse'`, `textColor`, `fillStyle`
(hand-drawn looks: `solid`, `hachure`, `cross-hatch`, `zigzag`, `dots`).
`s.circle({ r, label })` takes the same options.

`s.arrow(from, to, options)` draws an arrow. `from` and `to` are `[x, y]`,
`{ x, y }` or the `id` of an element drawn earlier. With an `id`, the arrow
stops at the edge of that element. Options: `bend` (about -1 to 1), `head`
(`end`, `start`, `both`, `none`), `label`, `labelSize`, `labelColor`,
`labelFont` (the handwritten font by default; `'body'` suits `clean`),
`labelOffset`, `gap`, `dashed`, `width`, `headSize`. `s.connect` does the
same.

### Icons and images

```js
s.icon('database', { x: 1500, y: 540, size: 140, color: 'purple', at: 'database' });
s.icon('lock', { bg: 'circle', color: 'green', label: 'Encrypted', at: 4 });
s.image('assets/app.png', { w: 1100, frame: 'browser', url: 'app.example.com', at: 0.5 });
s.image('assets/cables.png', { w: 1000, frame: 'card', at: 'cables', kenburns: true });
```

The 1,854 icons come from Lucide. Search them with `explainroo icons <word>`.
Old Lucide names work too. Icon options: `size` (120), `color`, `weight` (2),
`bg` (`true`, `'circle'`, `'square'` or a color), `bgScale`, `label`,
`labelSize`, `labelColor`, `labelFont`.

`s.image(src, options)` draws a file from `assets/`. Options: `w` and/or `h`
(the image keeps its shape), `fit` (`cover` or `contain`), `radius`, `frame`
(`none`, `card`, `browser`, `window`, `phone`), `url` (for the browser frame),
`border`, `shadow: false`, `kenburns: true` for a slow zoom.

### Pointing things out

```js
s.text('It is *not* magic', { id: 'claim', y: 400, at: 0 });
s.annotate('claim', { type: 'underline', at: 'magic' });
s.annotate({ x: 960, y: 700, w: 400, h: 90 }, { type: 'circle', color: 'red', at: 3 });
```

`s.annotate(target, options)` marks an element or a box. `type` is
`underline`, `circle`, `box`, `highlight`, `strike`, `cross` or `bracket`.
Options: `color`, `padding`, `width`, `dur`.

### Lists, numbers and charts

```js
s.list(['Browser cache', 'Resolver', 'Root server'], { x: 360, y: 280, at: 'first', stagger: 1.1 });
s.number(1500000, { suffix: ' requests', at: 'million', y: 480 });
s.bars([{ label: '2023', value: 19 }, { label: '2024', value: 31 }], { at: 1, suffix: 'k' });
s.lineChart([3, 5, 4, 8, 13, 21], { labels: ['M', 'T', 'W', 'T', 'F', 'S'], at: 1 });
s.pie([{ label: 'Images', value: 55 }, { label: 'Other', value: 45 }], { donut: 0.55, at: 1 });
```

- `s.list(items, options)`: items are text or `{ text, at, icon, color, out }`.
  `x` is the left edge and `y` the top. Options: `size` (50), `width`, `gap`,
  `bullet` (`dot`, `dash`, `number`, `check`, `arrow` or an icon name),
  `bulletColor`, `at` (a start time or a list of times), `stagger` (0.7),
  `enter`.
- `s.number(value, options)` counts up with ticking sounds. Options: `from`,
  `dur` (1.4), `prefix`, `suffix`, `decimals`, `separator`, `group: false`,
  plus the text options.
- `s.bars(data, options)`: items are `{ label, value, color, at }`. A bar
  with its own `at` grows when that word is spoken. Options: `x`, `y`, `w`,
  `h`, `max`, `stagger`, `growDur`, `values: false`, `prefix`, `suffix`,
  `format(v)`, `labelSize`, `valueSize`, `fillStyle`.
- `s.lineChart(values, options)`: `x`, `y`, `w`, `h`, `min`, `max`,
  `labels`, `dots: false`, `area: false`, `color`, `dur`.
- `s.pie(data, options)`: `x`, `y`, `r`, `donut` (0 to 0.8), `labels: false`,
  `labelOffset`, `dur`.

### Code and terminal

```js
s.code("const res = await fetch(url);", { lang: 'js', title: 'app.js', at: 0.5 });
s.terminal(['$ npm install', 'added 42 packages in 3s'], { at: 1 });
```

`s.code(source, options)` shows code. Options: `lang` (`js`, `ts`, `py`,
`go`, `rust`, `php`, `sh`, `sql`, `json`, `md`), `size` (32), `w`, `title`
(or `false`), `lineNumbers: false`, `reveal` (`type`, `lines`, `none`),
`cps`, `lineDelay`, `highlight` (line numbers) and `highlightAt`. `check`
reports lines that are wider than the window.

`s.terminal(lines, options)` shows a terminal. Lines that start with `$ ` are
typed as commands. Other lines are output. A line can also be `{ cmd, at }`
or `{ out, at, color }`. Options: `w`, `size`, `rows`, `title`, `prompt`,
`cps` (22), `outputDelay`, `lineGap`.

### Camera, groups and your own drawing

- `s.camera([{ at, x, y, zoom, dur, rotate }])` moves the view. Call it first
  in the scene function.
- `s.group({ x, y, scale, rotate, at, out, enter }, () => { ... })` moves a
  set of elements together. Inside the group, positions count from `x`, `y`.
- `s.draw({ x, y, at, out }, (ctx, life) => { ... })` gives you the canvas 2D
  context, so you can draw anything the other methods cannot. `life.p` is the
  entrance progress from 0 to 1. `s.ctx` is also available.
- `s.burst({ x, y, at, count, colors })` fires confetti.
- `s.bg(color)` paints over the background.
- `s.rand(i)`, `s.noise(x)` and `s.wiggle(amount, speed)` give random values
  that come out the same every time you render.

### Sound

Elements make a sound when they enter. The look picks the sound. Drawn lines
scribble, cards pop, arrows whoosh, list items play rising notes, numbers
tick, typing clicks, and scenes change with a swipe. `sfx: false` silences
one element. `"sfx": "minimal"` in `video.json` keeps only the transitions
and the sounds you add yourself.

`s.sfx(name, at, { gain, dur, pitch })` adds a sound: `pop`, `click`,
`whoosh`, `swipe`, `tick`, `type`, `ding`, `chime`, `thud`, `scribble`,
`chalk`, `rise`, `sparkle`, `blip`, `error`. `dur` sets the length of `type`,
`scribble`, `chalk` and `rise` (`rise` ends at `at + dur`). The music is made
to fit the video, and it gets quieter while the voice speaks.

### Colors and fonts

For product demos in a brand's own colors and fonts, see
[Product demos](#product-demos).

Color names: `accent`, `ink`, `muted`, `bg`, `surface`, `red`, `orange`,
`yellow`, `green`, `teal`, `blue`, `purple`, `pink`, `gray`. Each look has its
own version of each color, so scenes keep working when you change the look.
`s.color(name)` returns the CSS color and `s.tint(name)` the light fill. The
font roles are `display`, `body`, `hand` and `mono`.

## Things that break

- Calling an element only sometimes, like `if (s.t > 3) s.box(...)`. Always
  call it, and use `at` and `out` for the timing. The sound effects and the
  checks depend on this.
- An arrow or annotation that points to an `id` drawn later in the function.
- `s.camera()` after other elements. It has to come first.
- An `at` later than the end of the scene. Make the scene longer with
  `{hold=2}` or `{min=6}` in the script.
- Random values from anything other than `s.rand()`, `s.noise()` or
  `Math.random()` inside the scene function. Only those three come out the
  same on every render.
- Text in AI images. Put words on screen with `s.text`.
- A cue word that is spoken twice. `at: 'writes'` means the first time. Use
  `s.cue('writes', 2)` or a `[#marker]` for a later one. `check` lists such
  words as hints.
- Apostrophes in cue words. Cues ignore punctuation, so "visitor's" is heard
  as "visitors". `at: 'visitor'` then waits for the next plain "visitor".
  Use a `[#marker]` there.
- Elements inside `s.group`. Each one makes its sound at its own `at`, even
  while the group is still hidden. Give them the group's `at`, or
  `sfx: false`.
- Words that sound like other words. The speech check hears "won" as "one"
  and "plain" as "plane", and `{shown|spoken}` cannot fix that. Reword the
  sentence. For acronyms that are spelled out letter by letter, write
  `{API|A, P, I}`. Do not write `A.P.I.`, because the voice reads the dots
  like a web address.
- Growing a shape by changing `w` or `h` over time in the hand-drawn looks.
  The outline is drawn fresh every frame, so it wobbles. Animate `scale`
  instead.
- A scene change in the middle of one diagram. The default transition of
  `clean` slides the whole frame. Give scenes that share a diagram
  `{transition=fade}` or `{transition=cut}`.
- Arrows from an icon that has a label. The `id` of an icon covers the icon
  only, not its label, so an arrow that leaves downward crosses the label.
- Colored text in `paper` and `clean`. Green, orange and red are light enough
  for shapes but often too light for text. `check` warns about low contrast.
  Use `ink`, `accent` or a darker hex color for text.

`check` looks at text only. It finds text off the frame, too close to the
edge (3.5%), too small, with low contrast (against the page, or against the
text's own `bg`), on top of other text, or under the captions. It does not
see shapes, arrows and icons, or drawings made with `s.draw`. Look at the
stills for those.

## Working on explainroo itself

- `src/` is the part that runs in Node: script, voice, word timing, timeline,
  server, rendering, checks and images. `engine/` is the part that runs in
  the browser page: the scene API (`stage.js`), drawing (`pen.js`), looks,
  transitions, captions and audio (`engine/audio/`).
- Run `npm test` after changes. After engine changes, also render the videos
  in `examples/` and look at their stills and sheets.
- `dev/audio-lab.mjs` renders every music style and sound and measures them.
- `npm run build:icons` rebuilds the icons from `lucide-static`, and
  `npm run build:fonts` downloads the fonts again.
