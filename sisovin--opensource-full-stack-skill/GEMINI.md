# Full-Stack UI/UX + PHP Skill

This repository contains two major capability sets:

1. UI/UX intelligence driven by searchable design datasets and generation scripts.
2. Native PHP full-stack engineering guidance for production-grade apps.

This file consolidates both into one operating guide.

## When to apply

Use this skill whenever the task changes how the product looks, behaves, or works.

### Must use

- New screens: landing pages, dashboards, admin panels, SaaS views, app interfaces.
- UI component work: buttons, cards, forms, tables, dialogs, navigation, charts.
- Design decisions: style, palette, typography, spacing, interaction, motion.
- Frontend implementation: HTML5, Tailwind CSS v4, vanilla JS patterns.
- Backend implementation in PHP: routing, MVC, services, repositories, APIs.
- Data/auth/security work: PDO queries, transactions, sessions, CSRF, JWT, RBAC.
- Full-stack feature delivery that crosses UI and backend boundaries.

### Recommended

- UI looks inconsistent or low-quality but root cause is unclear.
- Users report usability, accessibility, or interaction friction.
- Auth flows need hardening, cleanup, or modernization.
- You need consistent rules for both design and implementation.

### Skip

- Pure infrastructure or DevOps tasks with no product/UI/backend code changes.
- Tasks unrelated to web app behavior.

## Core operating model

### Track A: UI/UX intelligence

Use data-backed search and design-system generation to pick style direction,
colors, typography, UX rules, and stack-specific guidance.

### Track B: PHP full-stack engineering

Use the references for architecture, secure auth, authorization, and MySQL/PDO
implementation details in a framework-free PHP 8.5 codebase.

### Track C: Integrated execution

For real features, run both tracks in order:

1. Define UX and visual rules.
2. Implement frontend structure and interactions.
3. Build backend routes, services, and persistence.
4. Apply security and access controls.
5. Verify quality with UX + security checklists.

## Rule categories by priority (long-form)

Use this matrix to decide validation order before implementation and before release.

| Priority | Category | Impact | Domain | Key checks (must have) | Anti-patterns (avoid) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Accessibility | CRITICAL | ux | Contrast 4.5:1, alt text, keyboard nav, aria labels | Hidden focus, icon-only controls without labels |
| 2 | Touch and interaction | CRITICAL | ux | Min target 44x44, 8px spacing, loading feedback | Hover-only behavior, instant unannounced state jumps |
| 3 | Performance | HIGH | ux | WebP/AVIF, lazy loading, reserve layout space | Layout thrashing, cumulative layout shift |
| 4 | Style selection | HIGH | style, product | Product-fit style, consistency, SVG icons | Random style mixing, emoji-as-icon structure |
| 5 | Layout and responsive | HIGH | ux | Mobile-first, viewport meta, no horizontal scroll | Fixed narrow desktop assumptions on mobile |
| 6 | Typography and color | MEDIUM | typography, color | 16px base, line-height 1.5+, semantic tokens | Tiny body text, gray-on-gray, raw ad-hoc hex values |
| 7 | Animation | MEDIUM | ux | 150-300ms timing, meaningful motion, continuity | Decorative-only motion, width/height animation |
| 8 | Forms and feedback | MEDIUM | ux | Visible labels, inline errors, helper text | Placeholder-only labels, delayed ambiguous errors |
| 9 | Navigation patterns | HIGH | ux | Predictable back, max 5 bottom tabs, deep links | Overloaded nav, broken back stack |
| 10 | Charts and data | LOW | chart | Correct chart type, legend/tooltips, accessible colors | Color-only encoding, unreadable dense charts |

```

### scripts/rg.*

Pinned ripgrep wrappers for environments where `rg` is unavailable globally:

- scripts/rg.cjs
- scripts/rg.cmd
- scripts/rg.ps1

## Engineering references in references/

Read only what matches the task, but use all relevant files for multi-layer work.

| File | Use for |
|---|---|
| references/php-core.md | PHP 8.5 language features, strict typing, enums, OOP patterns, errors, CLI |
| references/pdo-mysql.md | PDO config, prepared queries, CRUD, transactions, migrations, indexing |
| references/frontend.md | HTML5 semantics, Tailwind v4.2.2, responsive UI, forms, vanilla JS |
| references/architecture.md | Front controller, router, request lifecycle, sessions, REST endpoints |
| references/security.md | Validation, escaping, SQLi/XSS/CSRF prevention, headers, session hardening |
| references/authentication.md | Session auth, Argon2id, JWT access tokens, refresh token rotation |
| references/authorization.md | RBAC, permissions, policy checks, route guards, JWT scope decisions |
| references/auth-schema.md | Migration-ready auth schema, constraints, index strategy, seed order |
| references/middleware.md | AuthMiddleware, PermissionMiddleware, JwtMiddleware integration |

## Non-negotiable implementation rules

### UI/UX quality

1. Accessibility first: contrast, focus visibility, keyboard and screen-reader support.
2. Touch-safe interactions: minimum target sizing and clear feedback.
3. Responsive behavior without horizontal overflow.
4. Motion used meaningfully; respect reduced-motion.
5. Use semantic color and typography systems, not ad-hoc values.

### PHP/backend quality

1. Every PHP file starts with `declare(strict_types=1);`.
2. Use typed signatures and properties wherever practical.
3. Controllers remain thin; business logic belongs in services.
4. Use prepared statements only for external input.
5. Use transactions for multi-step writes.
6. Hash passwords with Argon2id via `password_hash` and verify with `password_verify`.
7. Regenerate session ID on login and enforce CSRF on state-changing browser requests.
8. Escape output at render time with `htmlspecialchars`.
9. Enforce authorization server-side; UI visibility is never a permission check.
10. Keep secrets in env files, not source control.

## Decision flow

Use this quick routing before implementation:

1. If the task is visual or interaction-heavy:
	- Run `scripts/search.py` for domain and stack guidance.
	- Use generated style/color/typography/pattern decisions.
2. If the task is backend/data/auth-heavy:
	- Read matching files under references/.
	- Implement with strict typing, PDO patterns, and security defaults.
3. If the task is full feature delivery:
	- Start with product + style + UX search.
	- Implement frontend structure from references/frontend.md.
	- Implement backend flow from architecture + PDO + auth refs.
	- Final pass with security.md and UX checklist.

## Default stack assumptions

Unless the repository explicitly overrides them:

- PHP 8.5
- Native MVC-style structure with public web root
- PDO + MySQL with utf8mb4
- Tailwind CSS 4.2.2
- Vanilla JS modules
- Session auth for web and JWT for APIs where needed

## Expected output behavior when this skill is used

Responses and code should be:

- Concrete and implementation-ready.
- Security-aware by default.
- UX-aware by default.
- Consistent across UI and backend layers.
- Minimal in abstraction and rich in practical choices.

## Quick examples

### Example: New SaaS dashboard

1. `python scripts/search.py "saas dashboard" --design-system -p "Project"`
2. `python scripts/search.py "dashboard table interactions" --domain ux`
3. Implement UI with `references/frontend.md`.
4. Add routes/controllers/services using `references/architecture.md`.
5. Add secure data flows using `references/pdo-mysql.md` and `references/security.md`.

### Example: Login + admin permissions

1. Build auth flow using `references/authentication.md`.
2. Build RBAC and guards with `references/authorization.md` and `references/middleware.md`.
3. Validate schema and indexes with `references/auth-schema.md`.
4. Verify CSRF/session/password/security headers with `references/security.md`.

## Deep pre-delivery checklist (long-form)

Use these final checks in addition to backend security checks.

### Visual quality

- No emoji used as structural icons.
- Icon family, stroke, and visual style are consistent.
- Brand assets use official ratios and clear-space rules.
- Press states do not cause layout shifts or jitter.
- Semantic theme tokens are used consistently.

### Interaction quality

- All tappable controls provide clear press feedback.
- Touch targets meet minimum size guidance.
- Micro-interactions are in the 150-300ms range.
- Disabled states are clearly non-interactive.
- Screen-reader labels and focus order are valid.
- Gestures do not conflict with each other or OS navigation.

### Light and dark mode quality

- Primary text contrast is >= 4.5:1 in both themes.
- Secondary text contrast is >= 3:1 in both themes.
- Dividers and control states remain visible in both themes.
- Modal and drawer scrim preserves foreground legibility.
- Both themes are tested directly; no inferred parity.

### Layout quality

- Safe areas are respected for fixed top/bottom bars.
- Scroll content is not hidden behind fixed elements.
- Verified across small phone, large phone, tablet, and landscape.
- Gutters and insets adapt across breakpoints.
- 4/8 spacing rhythm is consistent.
- Long-form text remains readable on wide screens.

### Accessibility quality

- All meaningful media and controls have accessible names.
- Form labels, hints, and errors are explicit and local.
- Color is not the only encoding channel.
- Reduced motion and text scaling do not break layout.
- Selected, disabled, and expanded states are announced correctly.

### Backend and security quality

- SQL is parameterized and query paths are indexed.
- Auth flow regenerates sessions and validates CSRF.
- Permission checks are enforced server-side.
- Error states are useful for users and safe for logs.
- Feature behavior is consistent across browser and API paths.
