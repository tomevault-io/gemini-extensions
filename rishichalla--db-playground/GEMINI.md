# AGENTS.md

Guidance for coding agents working in this repository.

## What this project is

A from-scratch, educational implementation of database internals in Rust. The
goal is to understand how real databases work under the hood — not to build a
production datastore. Currently the codebase implements a **disk-backed,
paged B+ Tree index**, plus the trait skeleton for a `Database` that will
eventually sit on top of it.

## Layout

```
src/
  lib.rs        - Crate root. Declares `pub mod btree` and the `Database<Key, Record>`
                   trait (insert/remove/update/lookup), which nothing implements yet.
  btree/mod.rs   - The entire B+ Tree implementation and its tests (~650 lines,
                   single file, no submodules).
```

Everything currently lives in `src/btree/mod.rs`: key types, page/serialization
logic, the tree node structure, insertion/traversal logic, and tests. There is
no separate `Database` implementation yet — `lookup_record`/`insert_record`/etc.
are not wired to `BPlusTree` yet.

## Core architecture (src/btree/mod.rs)

**Paging model**
- The index is a single flat file split into fixed-size `PAGE_SIZE` (4096-byte)
  pages, addressed by `PageOffset(usize)` (a page number, not a byte offset).
- Page 0 is reserved for `BPlusTreeInner` (tree metadata: root offset, size,
  depth, next free page, free list). `PageOffset::inner()` returns this
  reserved offset, and writing/reading a `TreeNode` there is treated as a bug
  (`IndexingError::MetadataOverwrite`).
- `PageOffset::default()` is `1`, since page 0 is metadata.
- New pages come from `BPlusTree::get_insertion_point`, which prefers reusing
  freed pages (`inner.free_list`) before bumping `inner.next_page`.

**Serialization**
- `bincode` 2.x is used directly (not serde) via manual `Encode`/`Decode`
  impls where custom framing is needed (see `StringKey`). Standard
  `#[derive(Encode, Decode)]` is used everywhere else.
- Encoding uses a fixed configuration: little-endian, fixed-width ints, capped
  at `PAGE_SIZE` (`PageOffset::bincode_config()`). Writes that would exceed a
  page are rejected (`IndexingError::WritePageOverflow`) rather than spanning
  multiple pages.
- `PageOffset::write_page` / `read_page` are the only places that touch the
  file directly (seek to `offset * PAGE_SIZE`, encode/pad/write, or read/decode).

**Caching**
- `BPlusTree.node_cache` is an `LruCache<PageOffset, TreeNode<Key>>` sized to
  hold ~4MB of pages (`LRU_CACHE_SIZE`), wrapped in a `RefCell` since lookups
  need mutable cache access (to record recency) through a `&self` API.
- `PageOffset::load_node` is the single entry point for fetching a node: check
  cache, else read from disk and populate the cache.

**Tree structure**
- `TreeNode<Key>` is generic over the key type and used for both branch and
  leaf nodes; `variant: TreeNodeVariant` (`Leaf` | `Branch`) distinguishes
  them. `splits: Vec<TreeNodeChild<Key>>` holds `(key, child)` pairs, where
  `child` is a `RecordRow` (leaf) or `PageOffset` (branch) stored as a raw
  `usize` (no enum — the variant on the node tells you how to interpret it).
- Nodes carry `left`/`right` sibling pointers (for sequential leaf traversal)
  and a `parent` pointer (for upward traversal on split/insert).
- `TreeNode::max_splits()` computes fan-out from `PAGE_SIZE` and
  `size_of::<Key>()`, so bigger keys (e.g. `StringKey<512>`) yield shallower
  fan-out and deeper trees — this is deliberately exploited in
  `test_deep_tree` to force multi-level splits.
- `IndexKey` is a marker trait (`Debug + Ord + Encode + Decode<()> + Clone`)
  blanket-implemented for anything that satisfies the bounds, used to keep
  trait bounds short elsewhere.
- `StringKey<const MAX_SIZE: usize>` wraps `arrayvec::ArrayString` to give a
  fixed-size, `Ord`-able string key, with hand-written `Encode`/`Decode` that
  writes a length prefix followed by a zero-padded fixed-size buffer (needed
  because `bincode`/`ArrayString` don't support this framing out of the box).

**Transactional writes**
- Mutations (insert, and future remove) never touch disk or the live cache
  directly. They operate on cloned/loaded nodes and accumulate results in a
  `HashMap<PageOffset, TreeNode<Key>>` (`mutated_nodes`) plus a modified copy
  of `BPlusTreeInner`. Using a `HashMap` keyed by `PageOffset` guarantees at
  most one final version per page per transaction.
- `BPlusTree::commit_transaction` is the only place that performs the actual
  disk writes for a set of changes: it checkpoints the previous state,
  attempts all writes, and rolls back to the checkpoint on any failure. Only
  on full success are the in-RAM `inner` and node cache updated. See the
  `IndexingError` variants (`Reversion`, `Io`, etc.) for the failure/rollback
  contract.
- `TreeNode::insert_item` implements the recursive insert/split/promote logic
  entirely against `mutated_nodes` and a mutable `inner`, so it can be unit
  tested and reasoned about without any I/O.

## Coding style conventions to follow

- **Extensive doc comments (`///`) on nearly every item** — structs, fields,
  enum variants, and functions all get a comment explaining *why*/*what it
  guarantees*, not just a restatement of the name. Match this density when
  adding new code; a new public/private item without a doc comment is the
  exception, not the norm.
- Error handling is done through dedicated `enum ... Error` types (see
  `IndexingError`) with `Debug` derived, and doc comments on variants that
  spell out disk/RAM consistency guarantees after that error occurs (e.g.
  "The Disk and RAM state is guaranteed to be stable, even if this error
  occurs."). Preserve or update these guarantees precisely when touching
  error paths — they're load-bearing documentation, not filler.
- Prefer explicit `Result<_, IndexingError>` returns and `.map_err(...)` over
  `unwrap`/`panic!` outside of tests. `todo!()` is used as an explicit
  placeholder for genuinely unimplemented functionality (e.g. `BPlusTree::remove`).
- Generic bounds are consolidated into marker traits (`IndexKey`) rather than
  repeated inline everywhere.
- Mutation is modeled explicitly as "operate on owned/cloned data, collect
  changes into a map, commit atomically" rather than mutating in place —
  preserve this pattern for any new tree operation (e.g. `remove`) instead of
  mutating cached/disk nodes directly.
- No `unsafe`, no external async runtime, no logging framework — this is a
  synchronous, single-threaded, dependency-light implementation
  (`arrayvec`, `bincode`, `lru` are the only runtime deps).

## Tests

- All tests live inline in `src/btree/mod.rs` under `#[cfg(test)] mod test`.
- Tests write real files under `test-data/` (created/cleared via
  `reset_db_file`), exercising real disk I/O rather than mocking the
  filesystem — keep new tests consistent with this (real file per test, unique
  filename per test to avoid collisions).
- The common test helper `test_records` inserts a set of `(Key, RecordRow)`
  pairs (optionally shuffled), verifies lookups during and after insertion,
  then **drops and reloads** the `BPlusTree` from disk to confirm persistence
  actually round-trips. New tree operations should have a test that follows
  this same insert → verify → reload → verify shape.
- Run tests with `cargo test`.

## When extending this codebase

- If implementing `Database` for `BPlusTree` (per `src/lib.rs`), keep the
  atomic-commit pattern (build up mutated state, then call
  `commit_transaction` once) rather than mutating incrementally.
- If implementing `BPlusTree::remove`, mirror the structure of `insert`/
  `insert_item`: compute all changes against loaded/cloned nodes into a
  `mutated_nodes` map and a modified `inner`, then commit once at the end.
- Any new on-disk format (new node type, new metadata field) must go through
  `Encode`/`Decode` and respect `PAGE_SIZE` — check `WritePageOverflow`
  handling if it might not fit.
