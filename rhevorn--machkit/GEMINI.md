# MachKit H5 Tool Development Rules

This file applies to everything under `Tool/`. MachKit H5 tools run inside a
native macOS `WKWebView`; they must feel like one product with the SwiftUI shell,
not like unrelated web pages.

## Priorities

When requirements conflict, use this order:

1. Preserve correctness, user data, native capability boundaries, and accessibility.
2. Preserve the requested layout and behavior unless the task explicitly changes them.
3. Keep all tools visually consistent with MachKit and with each other.
4. Prefer shared components and semantic tokens over tool-specific styling.
5. Keep the bundled web payload and runtime work proportional to the tool.

## Architecture

- Use React, Vite, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS as configured in this project.
- Source files use `.ts` / `.tsx`. Import specifiers keep the TypeScript ESM
  convention of `.js` (resolved to the `.ts` / `.tsx` implementation). HTML
  entry scripts and module workers point at the real `.tsx` / `.worker.ts` paths.
- Mount every tool with `mountTool()`.
- Use `ToolPage` and `ToolContent` for the common page shell and content geometry.
- Keep one `index.html` entry per tool under `tools/<tool-id>/`.
- Keep pure transformation logic separate from React, normally in a sibling module
  such as `json.ts`, and test it with Node's test runner via `tsx`
  (`npm test` / `node --import tsx --test`).
- Use `@/runtime/machkit.js` as the only boundary for native operations.
- Use relative asset paths. Bundled tools are loaded from local files with Vite
  `base: "./"`.

## Component Library

The repository-owned shadcn/ui component layer in `src/ui` is the standard for
all user-facing H5 controls. Radix Primitives provide accessible behavior,
Tailwind CSS provides styling, and CVA defines shared variants.

- Import shared controls from `@/ui/index.js`.
- Reuse `ToolPage`, `ToolContent`, `Section`, `Field`, `Input`, `Textarea`,
  `CheckboxField`, `Button`, `SelectControl`, `SegmentedControl`, `ValueField`,
  `InlineMessage`, and the other shared exports before adding a component.
- Use standard DOM/shadcn props such as `onClick`, `disabled`, `aria-invalid`,
  and the component's documented Radix state props.
- Use Phosphor icons. Do not introduce a second general icon library.
- CodeMirror, canvas, charts, image editors, and other specialized workspaces may
  use purpose-built libraries when the shared layer has no equivalent. Their
  surrounding controls must still use the shared shadcn/ui layer.
- Do not create a local imitation of a shared control with raw `<button>`,
  `<input>`, or a large Tailwind class string.
- Semantic HTML used only for structure (`main`, `section`, `header`, `div`,
  `code`, `pre`) does not need a component wrapper.
- Do not add HeroUI, MUI, Ant Design, Chakra, Mantine, or another competing
  general-purpose component library.

### Legacy components

Some existing tools still contain ad-hoc raw controls or tool-specific component
styles. Treat those implementations as legacy:

- Do not add new ad-hoc control styles when a shared component exists.
- Do not perform an unrelated repository-wide migration while fixing one tool.
- When a task explicitly migrates a tool, migrate all visible controls in that
  tool so the page does not mix two button, field, card, or feedback systems.
- Move reusable variants and theme adaptations into `src/ui`, not into a tool
  folder.

### Imports and bundle size

- Import components through `@/ui/index.js`; avoid deep imports from individual
  UI files outside `src/ui`.
- Use `components.json` and the shadcn workflow when a missing primitive should
  be added. Adapt generated code to the repository's tokens, naming, and
  Phosphor icon language before use.
- Keep one source file per shared component and export it from `src/ui/index.ts`.
- Before adding a dependency, confirm that the shared layer, Radix, the platform,
  or an existing dependency cannot already handle the requirement.
- Commit `package.json` and `package-lock.json` together.

### Product-pattern components

Shared shadcn primitives are the base layer. Repeated tool workflows belong in a
second repository-owned product-pattern layer under `src/ui`.

- Prefer shared patterns such as `ToolToolbar`, `ExampleChips`, `PropertyList`,
  `PropertyRow`, `StatusStrip`, `ResultPanel`, `SplitWorkspace`, `ToolSidebar`,
  `EditorPane`, `ActionGroup`, `RadioDot`, and `Slider` when they are available.
- If the same composition is needed by two or more tools, add or extend a shared
  pattern instead of copying markup and Tailwind classes into each tool.
- Product-pattern components own common geometry, density, state presentation,
  responsive behavior, and accessibility. Tool pages supply content and business
  behavior.
- Export shared patterns from `@/ui/index.js`. Do not deep-import them or create a
  parallel `components` folder inside a tool.
- A shared pattern must remain general enough for its named workflow. Do not add
  tool-specific business rules or native capabilities to the UI layer.

## Themes

MachKit has exactly two resolved visual themes: light and dark.

- `appearance="system"` is a preference mode, not a third theme. It must resolve
  to the same light or dark tokens according to the operating system.
- The native shell and browser development dock set `data-appearance`. Do not add
  an independent per-tool theme state.
- `src/ui/ui.css` is the single source of truth for MachKit tokens, shadcn CSS
  variables, and light/dark mappings.
- Shared components must consume semantic roles such as background, surface,
  field, border, secondary text, accent, danger, and focus. Do not fork the
  palette for an individual tool.
- Use system UI fonts and the shared monospace stack.
- Use semantic color variables. Hard-coded colors are allowed only for data
  visualization or protocol-specific syntax, and must have an intentional dark
  theme value.

### MachKit brand character

Every H5 tool should feel like a focused pane inside the native MachKit app, not
an independent website.

- Calm: neutral backgrounds and surfaces dominate; decorative effects do not
  compete with the task.
- Precise: alignment, labels, numeric values, and state changes are unambiguous.
- Compact: controls and spacing use desktop density, with no mobile-sized fields
  or oversized cards.
- Native: typography, focus, menus, shortcuts, and interaction rhythm should feel
  at home on macOS.
- Professional: one clear hierarchy, restrained emphasis, and predictable states
  take priority over novelty.
- Use blue only for primary actions, selection, focus, links, and useful data
  emphasis. Do not tint every panel or heading with the accent color.
- Use the shared monospace stack for source text, structured data, addresses,
  identifiers, byte values, code, and other machine-readable output. Keep labels
  and ordinary prose in the system UI font.

### Design token contract

Use semantic CSS variables from `src/ui/ui.css`; these values define the initial
MachKit rhythm and should only change as a deliberate system-wide design decision.

- Spacing scale: `0`, `4`, `8`, `12`, `16`, `24`, and `32` px.
- Radius scale: `4` px for tiny elements, `6` px for internal elements, `8` px
  for controls, `10` px for panels, and `12` px for overlays. Pill radii are only
  for semantic chips, segmented controls, and status badges.
- Control heights: `28` px for compact chips, `34` px for default fields, selects,
  segmented controls, and toolbar buttons. The standard tool toolbar is `54` px
  high. Keep Input / Select / Segmented / Button `sm` on the same `34` px token.
- Icon sizes: `14`, `16`, and `18` px. Typography sizes: `11` px caption, `12` px
  label, `13` px body/control, and `14` px compact title.
- Standard content padding is `16` px on the sides and bottom via `ToolContent`,
  with `4` px on top. Do not override `p` / `pt` / `pb` / `px` on `ToolContent`,
  and do not use negative margins to pull blocks to the window edge. Inner spacing
  uses `gap` and section spacing. Registry `height` is the viewport (Dev dock H);
  budget content as viewport minus top padding minus bottom padding.
- Standard borders are `1` px. The focus-visible ring is `3` px. Disabled opacity
  is `0.45` unless contrast or platform behavior requires a documented exception.
- Motion durations are `120`, `180`, and `240` ms with
  `cubic-bezier(0.2, 0, 0, 1)`. Respect reduced-motion preferences and avoid motion
  that does not communicate state or spatial continuity.
- The semantic color model includes canvas; surface, muted surface, and elevated
  surface; field; primary, secondary, and tertiary text; subtle, normal, and
  strong border; accent and accent-soft; info, success, warning, and danger with
  soft variants; and a focus ring.
- Retain the existing MachKit neutral and blue palette unless the task explicitly
  changes the brand system. Define both light and dark mappings together.
- Do not use arbitrary Tailwind values for shared spacing, radii, control heights,
  font sizes, shadows, or colors. Add a global token to `src/ui/ui.css` when a
  genuinely reusable value is missing.

### Visual consistency

- Use a clean native surface for the page background. Do not add gradients,
  tinted canvases, glass effects, decorative blobs, or patterned backgrounds
  unless the product requirement explicitly calls for them.
- Do not add large shadows to ordinary panels. Use borders and subtle shared
  elevation tokens; dark mode generally uses borders instead of shadows.
- Controls, panels, popovers, and result cards must use the shared radius,
  border, focus, and spacing tokens.
- Do not globally restyle shared shadcn components from inside one tool. Shared
  design decisions go into `src/ui`; tool CSS is for unique layout and
  specialized visualization only.
- A page should have at most one visually primary action in a toolbar. Secondary
  transformations use secondary/outline emphasis; copy, clear, and help actions
  use ghost or icon-only emphasis.
- Disabled, hover, pressed, focus-visible, pending, invalid, success, and danger
  states must remain distinguishable in both themes.

## Standard page templates

Every tool should use the closest established page family. Preserve an existing
layout unless the task explicitly migrates it; when migrating, keep the workflow
and information architecture intact.

1. **Editor/transform** — a toolbar above one or two editor panes, with examples,
   format actions, status, and copy behavior. Use for JSON and text transforms.
2. **Form/structured result** — compact labeled inputs followed by a stable result
   region composed from property rows or result panels. Use for IP, CIDR, and
   calculator-style tools.
3. **Sidebar workbench** — a narrow mode/navigation sidebar plus a primary editor
   or output workspace. Use for codec and unit-converter tools with multiple modes.
4. **Task/progress** — explicit inputs and primary action followed by progress,
   cancellation, partial results, completion, and error states. Use for scans and
   other asynchronous native operations.

- Select one primary template before writing tool-specific CSS.
- Compose the template from `ToolPage`, `ToolContent`, shared primitives, and
  product-pattern components. Tool CSS should describe only unique workspace
  layout or specialized visualization.
- Do not introduce a new page family because one screen needs a small variation;
  extend the closest shared template or pattern first.

## Layout and content

- Tool titles live in the native compact title bar. Do not repeat a large title
  or marketing subtitle inside the H5 page.
- Start with the task controls and working content. Do not add in-page title
  banners or info/exclamation buttons for tool introductions.
- Preserve the existing tool layout unless the user explicitly asks to change it.
  A visual refresh is not authorization to rearrange controls or workflows.
- Keep desktop tool density compact and macOS-like. Avoid mobile-sized controls,
  oversized cards, excessive rounding, and large empty decorative spacing.
- Use responsive rules for the actual minimum window size. Essential actions must
  remain available at narrow widths; labels may collapse before icons disappear.
- Long localized text, paths, JSON, URLs, and error messages must wrap or truncate
  deliberately without expanding the window unexpectedly.
- Results that appear conditionally must not cause avoidable layout jumps.

### Native window size

Each tool declares fixed metrics in `DeveloperToolRegistry`:
- `width`: `WebToolWidth.compact` (720) / `.regular` (840) / `.wide` (1040)
- `height`: H5 viewport height in points (Dev dock `H` = `window.innerHeight`;
  outer macOS window is taller by the titlebar)

Page edge inset is only `ToolContent` (`16` px sides/bottom, `4` px top). When
sizing a layout, budget content height as `viewport − 4 − 16`. Do not add
extra page-edge padding inside the tool.

Shared floors: `WebToolWidth.minimumWidth` (640) and `.minimumHeight` (360).
The window opens at `width × height` and does not auto-resize; the user can drag
to change size afterward. Design the H5 layout to fill that viewport (`h-full`).

## Accessibility and interaction

- Every icon-only action needs an `aria-label` and a useful tooltip or popover when
  its meaning is not universal.
- Associate labels and descriptions with fields through the shared Field/Label
  components and Radix accessibility APIs.
- Preserve keyboard navigation, focus-visible rings, Escape behavior, and logical
  tab order.
- Never rely on color alone for validation or status. Use `InlineMessage`, text,
  and an icon/indicator as appropriate.
- Use `machkit.copy()` for copy actions so native acknowledgement and shared copy
  feedback continue to work.
- Do not read the clipboard on an incidental render. Read only on tool open when
  the behavior is expected, or after an explicit user action.
- Do not disable the browser context menu unless the native interaction design
  explicitly requires it.

## Localization

- Put all user-facing strings in the tool's `messages.ts`.
- Do not hard-code fallback English in TSX when a message key can be provided.
- Keep every supported locale structurally complete and non-empty.
- Preserve punctuation and interpolation semantics across locales.
- Test at least one compact Latin locale and Simplified Chinese. For layout-sensitive
  changes, also inspect a locale likely to produce longer labels.

## Native bridge and security

- A tool may call only capabilities granted in `DeveloperToolRegistry`.
- Request the smallest native capability set needed by the tool.
- Do not call WebKit message handlers directly; go through `machkit` APIs so
  requests remain versioned, acknowledged, and time-bounded.
- Do not load remote scripts, fonts, trackers, or executable content.
- Do not place secrets, tokens, or privileged file paths in a web bundle.
- Treat pasted or opened content as untrusted. Escape output and avoid injecting
  user content with `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.
- Enforce input, output, batch, and file-size caps before allocating large buffers.

## Performance

- Keep typing responsive. Debounce non-trivial analysis and cancel or ignore stale
  results.
- Move CPU-heavy parsing, formatting, encoding, diffing, and image work to a module
  worker when it can block the main thread.
- Avoid re-parsing the same large input during render.
- Revoke object URLs and terminate workers during cleanup.
- Prefer tree-shaken imports and selective component styles.

## Adding a tool

1. Run `npm run new -- <kebab-case-tool-id>`.
2. Implement the pure logic and tests before or alongside the UI.
3. Add localized messages for every supported locale.
4. Register the tool in `DeveloperToolRegistry` with the appropriate width class
   and minimum native capabilities.
5. Add or update catalog metadata and ordering only when required.
6. Select the closest standard page template and reuse the corresponding shared
   product-pattern components.
7. Use the shared shadcn/ui controls, semantic tokens, and MachKit theme from the
   first version.
8. Run the verification checklist below.

Do not manually edit generated `Resources/WebTools` output. `npm run build:app`
regenerates it when app integration needs to be tested.

## Verification

Before handing off a tool change:

1. Run `npm test` from `Tool/`.
2. Run `npm run build` from `Tool/`.
3. Run `git diff --check`.
4. Inspect the tool in light and dark appearances.
5. Inspect the minimum/narrow window and a normal desktop window.
6. Exercise a real successful workflow, not only the empty state.
7. Inspect disabled, focus, invalid/error, success, loading, and conditional-result
   states affected by the change.
8. Check keyboard navigation and icon-only accessible names.
9. Confirm unrelated tools did not change because of shared CSS or theme edits.

For visual changes, screenshots must be taken from the running implementation;
do not judge the result only from CSS or TSX. Browser-only screenshots include a
development dock that is not present in the embedded MachKit view.

## Definition of done

A tool change is done only when:

- behavior and layout match the request;
- visible controls use the designated component system consistently;
- the page follows the closest standard template and reuses shared product
  patterns where applicable;
- colors, spacing, radii, control heights, borders, typography, focus, elevation,
  and motion come from shared semantic tokens rather than one-off values;
- both resolved themes align with MachKit;
- localization and accessibility are complete;
- heavy work and large inputs are bounded;
- tests and the production build pass; and
- the actual rendered result has been inspected in representative states.
