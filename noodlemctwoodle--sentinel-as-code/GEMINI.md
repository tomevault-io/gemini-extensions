# GitHub Copilot Instructions — Sentinel-As-Code

Repo-wide guidance for GitHub Copilot. Loaded automatically by Copilot
(VS Code, GitHub.com cloud agent, code review) on every chat request
in this workspace. Path-scoped instructions live under
[`.github/instructions/`](./instructions/) and stack on top of this file.

For the full Copilot setup map (agents, prompts, instructions),
see [`Docs/Development/GitHub-Copilot.md`](../Docs/Development/GitHub-Copilot.md).

## What this repo is

Sentinel-As-Code is a complete CI/CD solution for deploying Microsoft
Sentinel and Defender XDR content from a Git repo. It provisions
infrastructure (Bicep), deploys Content Hub solutions, custom analytical
rules, hunting queries, watchlists, playbooks, workbooks, parsers,
automation rules, summary rules, and Defender XDR custom detections.

Two equivalent CI/CD platforms are supported:

- **GitHub Actions** — under `.github/workflows/`
- **Azure DevOps Pipelines** — under `Pipelines/` (the source of truth
  the GitHub workflows mirror)

Start any unfamiliar task by reading [`Docs/README.md`](../Docs/README.md).

## Conventions you must follow

### Language and style

- **Spelling**: en-GB throughout (analyse, behaviour, customise,
  organisation, prioritise, recognise). Existing tooling produces en-US
  output — when editing tool output that uses en-US, leave the existing
  text alone but write any new prose in en-GB.
- **No em-dashes** (`—`) in user-visible prose unless they already
  exist in the file you're editing. Prefer hyphens (`-`) or
  parenthetical phrasing.
- **No emojis** in code, commit messages, or files unless the file
  already uses them. Documentation can use them sparingly when they
  add real meaning (e.g. status icons in tables).

### File headers

Every new PowerShell / Bicep / YAML / JSON file should carry a header
that includes the full repo-relative path and a creation date in
DD/MM/YYYY format. Example:

```powershell
#
# Sentinel-As-Code/Scripts/Foo.ps1
#
# Created by <author> on DD/MM/YYYY.
#
```

For YAML / JSON files where a comment header isn't natural (e.g. data
files), skip the header — but for hand-authored content like analytical
rules, include a brief metadata block at the top of the file.

### Commit messages

Conventional commit format: `type(scope): brief description`.

- **Types**: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `perf`, `style`, `docs`,
  `test`, `chore`, `ci`, `build`, `revert`
- **Scope examples**: `(modules)`, `(scripts)`, `(workflows)`,
  `(deps)`, `(rules)`, `(playbooks)`, `(testing)`, `(deploy)`,
  `(drift)`
- **Body**: explain *why* (business / technical justification), *what*
  changed (file list with reasons), how it was tested. Multi-paragraph
  bodies are normal here; trivial one-liners are not.

**Never include in a commit message**:
- References to Claude, Anthropic, AI assistance, ChatGPT, Copilot, or
  any LLM. Including a `Co-Authored-By` trailer for an AI tool.
- "Generated with..." or similar phrases.
- Emojis (unless the existing log already uses them — it doesn't here).

### Pull requests

- Keep PRs small and atomic. Multiple related commits in one PR is
  fine; multiple unrelated changes is not.
- PR titles follow the same conventional-commit format as commit
  messages.
- The five-job PR-validation gate must pass: `validate`, `bicep-build`,
  `arm-validate`, `kql-validate`, `dependency-manifest`. See
  [Docs/Development/Pester-Tests.md](../Docs/Development/Pester-Tests.md).

## Hard rules (do not break)

1. **Never push to `main` directly.** All changes go through PRs.
2. **Never push to `auto/*` rolling branches.** Those are bot-managed
   (drift sync, dependency-manifest sync) and `--force-with-lease`
   pushed by their workflows.
3. **Never modify `dependencies.json` by hand.** It is auto-derived.
   To update it, edit the content that generates it and run
   `./Scripts/Build-DependencyManifest.ps1 -Mode Generate`. The
   PR-validation `dependency-manifest` job will fail any hand-edit.
4. **Don't commit secrets.** Use OIDC federated credentials for Azure
   auth (already configured); use Key Vault references for runtime
   secrets in Logic App playbooks.
5. **Don't bypass the merge gate.** No `--no-verify` on commit, no
   `git push --force` on `main`.
6. **Don't widen role assignments without justification.** The deploy
   SP runs with `Contributor` + ABAC-conditioned `User Access
   Administrator`. Adding broader roles requires a documented reason.

## Testing

Every PR runs the full Pester suite (~6,000 assertions across 17
files) plus the Wave 3 schema gates. To run locally before pushing:

```powershell
./Scripts/Invoke-PRValidation.ps1 -RepoPath .
```

To run a specific suite:

```powershell
Invoke-Pester -Path Tests/Test-AnalyticalRuleYaml.Tests.ps1
```

Test-authoring conventions live in
[Docs/Development/Pester-Tests.md](../Docs/Development/Pester-Tests.md).
The repo uses an AST-extraction pattern (functions are extracted from
scripts and dot-sourced into the test scope) rather than running scripts
end-to-end. Read that doc before adding tests.

## When you're unsure

- For schema questions: read the relevant `Docs/Content/<Type>.md` first.
- For deploy-pipeline questions: read [Docs/Deployment/Pipelines.md](../Docs/Deployment/Pipelines.md).
- For test-authoring questions: read [Docs/Development/Pester-Tests.md](../Docs/Development/Pester-Tests.md).
- For dependency / discovery questions: read [Docs/Operations/Dependency-Manifest.md](../Docs/Operations/Dependency-Manifest.md).

If the docs disagree with the code, **the code is the source of
truth** and the docs need updating — flag it in your PR.
