# A11 Engineering Guide

## Source of truth and layout

- `a11/` defines the current Python API and behavioural contract. `cpp/` is
  its native implementation and should converge on the same semantics.
  `actionengine/` is historical reference material, not the source of truth.
- Keep independently linkable C++ components (`core`, `data`, `concurrency`,
  `stores`, `net`, `nodes`, `actions`, and `service`). Each `cpp/a11/<part>/`
  owns its source list in its local `CMakeLists.txt`; the target and dependency
  graph remain visible in `cpp/CMakeLists.txt`.
- Concurrency types live directly in `namespace a11`, even though their files
  remain under `a11/concurrency/`. Do not recreate `a11::concurrency`.
- Byte-level primitives that several unrelated components need are **header-only
  inline** functions, so sharing them costs no link dependency: `a11/utf8.h`
  (`IsContinuation`, `SequenceWidth`, `Utf16Units`, `IsValid`) and
  `a11/percent.h` (`HexDigit`, `Decode`, `DecodeStrict`, `Encode`). That is what
  lets `a11::flow_lang`, which links nothing but Abseil and nlohmann, use the
  same UTF-8 rules as the serializer. Reach for these rather than open-coding a
  lead-byte ladder or a `%xx` loop, and add new ones to
  `cpp/tests/header_canary.cc`. The strict UTF-8 validator has one home,
  `a11::IsValidUtf8` in `a11/json_codec.h`; `FindUnencodableString` beside it is
  iterative on purpose, because fiber stacks are small and fixed.
- Public stateful Python runtime types reuse the bound native class objects;
  do not add shadow Python implementations or facade subclasses for concrete
  native types. Attach thin, asynchronous, idiomatic protocols to the bound
  classes, while retaining deliberate virtual adapters such as
  `LocalChunkStore` where Python subclass overrides must cross into C++.
- Pydantic-style validation, JSON, copy, and schema helpers augment native
  binary and schema values; they must not introduce a second public data model.
  Python serializers and deserializers continue to operate on those native
  values.
- A Python reimplementation of logic the native library already has needs a
  reason a caller can feel: pydantic and `IntEnum` ergonomics, the exception a
  Python developer expects, duck typing a C++ signature cannot express. Parity
  is not a reason. Where the only difference is language, delegate to the
  binding and delete the copy — a second implementation is one that falls
  behind, and the fix is to remove it rather than to test it. This does not
  license collapsing the per-language *data tables* below (serial tags, status
  chunks): those exist once per language because each language needs its own
  literals, and `testdata/` pins them to each other.
- Flow is the language whose programs are compositions of actions that are
  themselves actions. **The language lives in `cpp/a11/flow/`**: the lexer, the
  highlighter, the parser, the resolver, the inspector, the formatter, the
  completion **and the runtime** are native, and every surface is a frontend over
  them — the `a11 flow` CLI, the `a11._native.flow` bindings, the standalone
  `a11-flow` binary, and the IntelliJ plugin. Nothing about the language is
  implemented in Python: `a11/flow/plan.py` and `a11/flow/runtime.py` are glue over
  `a11._native.flow`, and `flow.loads` is the strict door onto it.
    - The point of the move is that there is **one** implementation of each language
      judgement. There is no lexer, parser, resolver, inspector or word list in
      Kotlin, Python or a grammar file any more, and there must not be one again: a
      second copy is a copy that falls behind, and the fix is to delete it rather
      than test it. `a11/flow/tests/test_editor_support.py` now holds the *absence*
      of those copies.
    - The language tooling is `a11::flow_lang`, and it links **nothing but Abseil and
      nlohmann**. No sockets, no nodes, no OpenSSL. That is what lets it ship as
      `a11-flow` (a few megabytes, `A11_BUILD_FLOW_TOOL`) on platforms where the full
      runtime is not built, so keep it that way. The executing half is the separate
      `a11::flow_runtime` (`values.cc`, `runtime.cc`), which does link the node and
      action layers — and `a11_flow_test`'s link line is the proof the language does
      not.
    - The runtime is **fibers over one monitor**: `thread::` primitives only (never
      `std::mutex`), one lock and one condition variable per run, and blocking work
      done with the lock released. That is what makes giving up on a run possible at
      all — a pump waiting for a reader that will never come has to be woken. Every
      fiber gets a stack an interpreter frame chain fits in, because any of them can
      reach the `HostBridge`.
    - `HostBridge` is the three questions only the host can answer: coerce a value
      into a registered type, read one out of a chunk, write one into a chunk. The
      Python bindings answer them against the Python registry -- which is where a
      pydantic model actually lives -- and the standalone tool answers them with the
      C++ registry. A `Value` the language cannot take apart is carried as an opaque
      host object; the language only ever renders, indexes, compares or truth-tests
      one.
    - `cpp/a11/flow/service.cc` is the one service: a method name, a document, and an
      envelope back. `a11-flow serve --protocol json|lsp`, `a11 flow serve` and
      `a11._native.flow.request` are adapters over it, so a capability added there
      reaches all of them. Add a method there rather than a special case in one
      frontend.
    - Problems are **diagnostics, not exceptions**: the parser and resolver collect
      and recover, because an editor is looking at a file somebody is in the middle
      of typing. A strict entry point turns the first error into the
      `FlowSyntaxError` Python has always raised, with the same line, column and
      message. Every code is published in `testdata/flow/codes.json`, generated from
      the C++ table; the envelopes (`flow.diagnostics/v1` and friends, documented in
      `doc/docs/guides/flow-tooling.md`) are additive — adding a field is not a
      version change, and a reader must ignore what it does not know.
    - A fix travels **with** the diagnostic, as edits. A frontend applies them blind;
      nothing downstream re-derives what a repair should be.
- Flow must stay a layer *on* the public
  A11 surface, adding no runtime behaviour A11 does not already expose. A flow's
  semantics are the language's contract: steps run concurrently, every called
  output is drained, a local call's nodes stay off the wire, a stream read inside
  a loop or branch is materialised once and replayed, and a stream is produced
  only once something reads it (reading a status waits, and may end a node).
  Status codes are Abseil's canonical ones; every significant word is accepted in
  lower or upper case but never mixed. Changing any of that is a language change,
  so keep `a11/flow/tests/`, the grammar and `REFERENCE` in
  `a11/flow/__init__.py`, and `cpp/a11/flow/vocabulary.cc` in step with it.
  An editor that can run a process asks the language (`a11-flow serve`); one that
  cannot — a static grammar file — is **generated** from the vocabulary by
  `a11 flow syntax --target sublime --generate`, and `a11 flow syntax` fails when
  the checked-in file is not what the generator would write.
- A chunk's metadata is the only thing that says how to read its bytes. The
  media type is the representation; a `type` parameter names the value when the
  format does not already describe it. The seven JSON-native shapes (`object`,
  `array`, `string`, `integer`, `number`, `boolean`, `null`) carry no parameter,
  so a bare `application/json` or `application/x-msgpack` is complete and
  decodes to a dict / `nlohmann::json` / plain object / map. Nothing inside a
  payload names a type: a declared model's fields say what they hold, and
  schemaless data is just data. A caller naming an `obj_type` gets a best effort
  and a real deserialization error when the data will not fit.
- A serializable type carries the *same* wire tag in every language:
  `a11.<Class>` for the runtime's own types, `a11.sdk.<Class>` for the SDKs,
  subpackages omitted and the name chosen for what the type is. The table lives
  once per language — `a11/data/serial_tags.py` (an `A11_SERIAL_TAG` ClassVar
  per class), `cpp/a11/data/serial_tags.h` (returned by the `A11SerialTag` ADL
  point), `js/src/serial_tags.ts`, `kotlin/.../SerialTags.kt` — and
  `testdata/serial_tags.json` pins all four, with each suite asserting its own
  constants against it. Renaming a tag is a wire change: add the old spelling to
  the legacy alias map so readers keep accepting it, and never emit it again.
- A status carried as data is a *status chunk*: mimetype
  `application/x-a11-status`, payload the concatenated-MessagePack
  `(code, message, details)` record, built in one place per language
  (`a11::data::MakeStatusChunk`, `statusToChunk`, `status_to_chunk`) and read
  back through that language's decoder. Action dispatch/completion statuses,
  node aborts and the closure marker a drained writer tees all use that one
  shape; `testdata/status_chunk.json` pins the mimetype, the `a11-close`
  marker attribute and the payload bytes, with each suite asserting its own
  helpers against it. It stays outside the serialization registry on purpose:
  `StatusOr` cannot carry a non-OK status as a *value*, which is what the
  dedicated helpers and the `DecodedStatus` box exist for.

## Concurrency architecture

- Thread is A11's scheduling substrate. In A11 code, explicitly spell
  `thread::Mutex`, `thread::MutexLock`, `thread::CondVar`, and
  `thread::SleepFor`. Mutex members are `mu`/`mu_`; condition variables are
  `cv`/`cv_`.
- Protect shared state with Abseil annotations (`ABSL_GUARDED_BY`,
  `ABSL_EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED`, and `ABSL_LOCKS_EXCLUDED`) and keep
  `-Wthread-safety` clean.
- Boost.Context/Fiber is an implementation detail of Thread. No header may
  include or expose a Boost type. Fixed, stack-resident opaque storage is
  preferred for small Boost-backed primitives; implementation size/alignment
  assertions must guard it.
- The native `std::mutex`/`std::condition_variable` pair in Thread's Boost
  scheduler is deliberate: it parks an OS worker when no fiber is runnable.
  Do not replace that scheduler-internal pair with fiber-aware primitives.
  A11 state and ordinary Thread APIs must use the fiber-aware primitives.
- Use fibers near user-facing synchronous-looking APIs where they improve
  clarity. Use fair, bounded, stackless callback pumps for high-cardinality
  internal state machines. `ChunkStoreReader` and `ChunkStoreWriter` share
  stackless schedulers; never add a permanently allocated fiber per instance.
- Root-fiber stack size is configurable through
  `THREAD_DEFAULT_FIBER_STACK_SIZE` and `thread::TreeOptions::stack_size`.
  Avoid extra context switches and do not introduce unbounded queues.
- Thread changes require cooperative-concurrency tests: cancellation and tree
  propagation, `Select`/`SelectUntil`, `SleepFor`, timed waits, FIFO behaviour,
  deadlock resistance, waiter cleanup, and joined/detached fiber lifetime.
- **Debug a hang with `thread/introspect.h` before anything else.** A11's own
  `.claude/settings.json` enforces this: `scripts/hook_fiber_debugging.sh` puts
  the procedure in context at session start and on any prompt about a hang,
  deadlock or timeout. Do not add print statements, raise a timeout, or read
  code speculatively until a fiber report has been read.
- Prose rules are enforced too. `scripts/hook_writing_style.sh context` states
  the writing style at session start, with examples and counterexamples;
  `... filter` refuses a Write or Edit carrying the phrases it names. In short:
  describe the artefact in a present-tense factual verb; delete history,
  counterfactual warnings, intent emphasis and value framing rather than
  rephrasing them; lead documentation with what the reader can do; and compare
  to a named product by granting its strengths and stating A11's own limits,
  never with a superlative. Commits `14c8e9ba`, `bac44c5` and `76499e8` are
  where the rules were applied wholesale.
- A blocked fiber's stack is parked where no OS thread points at it, so `bt` and
  a core dump miss the frames that explain a hang. `thread/introspect.h` records
  each fiber's wait kind, wait object and frame pointer when it blocks, and
  unwinds the parked stacks from those frame pointers on request:
  `A11_FIBER_WATCHDOG=<seconds>`, `kill -USR2`, `thread::FormatFiberReport()`,
  `a11.debug.fiber_report()`, or `scripts/a11_fibers.py` under LLDB or GDB for a
  core file. The repo's `.lldbinit` and `.gdbinit` load that script; both
  debuggers need a one-line opt-in before reading a directory-local init
  file. A new blocking path in Thread needs a `THREAD_WAIT_SCOPE` where it
  blocks, or it appears in reports as `running`. The walk requires the frame
  pointers `A11_FRAME_POINTERS` keeps. See
  `doc/docs/guides/debugging-concurrency.md`.

## C++ API and implementation rules

- Model ownership with `std::unique_ptr` and `std::shared_ptr`; use raw pointers
  for temporary non-owning access. Prefer `make_unique`/`make_shared`, write
  `ptr == nullptr` or `ptr != nullptr`, and apply `absl_nonnull`,
  `absl_nullable`, or `absl_nullability_unknown` to raw-pointer contracts.
- Avoid reference counting where ownership is singular or scope-bound. Prefer
  inline storage, contiguous data, `absl::InlinedVector`, bounded arenas, or a
  stack-optimised pImpl when lifetime and size justify them.
- Thread is an accepted public A11 dependency. Keep direct members and inline
  implementations when Thread was the only reason for a pImpl. Hide other
  third-party implementation types with forward declarations or pImpl unless
  they are intrinsically part of a public data contract.
- Use `absl::flat_hash_map` and `absl::flat_hash_set`. Use
  `absl::node_hash_map` only when mapped-value addresses truly must remain
  stable; pointer-valued flat maps already have stable pointees. Test lookup
  iterators instead of using `.contains()`.
- Use unqualified `size_t`, not `std::size_t`.
- Virtual functions have no default arguments. Provide non-virtual convenience
  overloads when defaults are useful.
- Initialise every aggregate field deliberately. Treat use-after-move,
  implicit narrowing, and partially initialised state as correctness bugs.

## Exceptions

- **A11 does not throw.** Every A11 library is compiled `-fno-exceptions`, so a
  `throw` or a `try` in A11's own code is a compile error. Errors are
  `absl::Status`; a violated invariant is a `CHECK`. **There is no build option
  for this** -- it is what A11 is, not how it happens to be configured, and a
  half nobody compiles is the half that rots. It constrains A11's own translation
  units only: a consumer compiles its own with exceptions if it likes, links
  normally, and throws freely in its own frames.
- Exceptions survive in exactly the translation units that *call* code which can
  throw, and each one names itself in the exception policy block of
  `cpp/CMakeLists.txt`: boost fiber's internals, libdatachannel's `rtc::` API,
  whisper.cpp, nlohmann's two entry points with no non-throwing overload
  (`a11/json_codec.cc`), and the per-library `boundary.cc` files. Adding to that
  list needs a throwing callee to point at; wanting to catch something A11 would
  have raised is not a reason, because A11 raises nothing.
- A callable a *caller* hands us is the one real boundary. Wrap it with
  `a11::exception_guard::Wrap` where A11 adopts it -- where `on_message` is
  stored, where a codec is registered -- never with a `try` at the call. A `try`
  in one of A11's own frames protects nothing: the exception would have to unwind
  through a `-fno-exceptions` frame first, which is undefined and skips its
  destructors.
  `a11/exception_guard.h` explains this in full, including
  `exception_guard::Attempt`, which is the form for a template in a header.
- Implementations of A11's interfaces -- `WireStream`, `ChunkStore` -- report
  through their `Status` return and must not throw. The Python trampolines
  already convert (`cpp/python/interop.cc`); a C++ implementation that calls a
  throwing library is expected to catch in its own translation unit.
- nlohmann defines `JSON_NOEXCEPTION` under `-fno-exceptions`, which turns its
  throws into `std::abort()`. Parse untrusted text and dump arbitrary bytes
  through `a11/json_codec.h`, which returns `Status`; everywhere else, precede a
  `get<T>()` or a subscript with the `is_*()`/`find()` check that makes it
  well-typed, as the existing JSON code does.
- Public headers must compile both ways. `tests/header_canary.cc` compiles every
  installed header with exceptions disabled; add new ones to it.
- **A header containing a `try` may only be included where exceptions are on, and
  do not rely on the compiler to tell you.** `a11/internal/exception_guard_impl.h`
  is the one such header; it carries an `#error` for the no-exceptions case
  because whether a `try` in an *uninstantiated* template body is a diagnostic is
  compiler-dependent -- GCC and clang up to ~17 reject it at parse time, Apple
  clang 21 accepts it. `a11/exception_guard.cc` included it for years of nothing
  and then broke only on the CI macOS runner. If you need the `Failure` trait
  without the wrappers, include `a11/internal/exception_guard_failure.h`, which
  has no `try` and needs no opt-out.

## Abseil conventions

- Abseil `Status`, `StatusOr`, `Time`, and `Duration` are the native error and
  timing types. Prefer `ABSL_RETURN_IF_ERROR` and `ABSL_ASSIGN_OR_RETURN`.
- For `absl::StatusOr<absl::Status>`, use `AssignStatus` to represent an outer
  error; do not add a wrapper type or conflate it with the inner status value.
- Log through Abseil (`LOG(ERROR)`, `DLOG`, and checks), never `std::cerr`.
  Add `AbslStringify` to custom value types used in diagnostics.
- Preserve structured A11 status details across C++, MessagePack/JSON, and
  Python. Python callers must receive `a11.status.StatusException`, not a
  generic or pybind11-specific exception.

## Networking

- WebSocket transport and WebSocket signalling use A11's nghttp2/HTTP2 stack.
  libdatachannel is reserved for WebRTC data channels and peer connections.
- All channel transports use the Action Engine-compatible byte-chunking wire
  format. Keep `ChannelFramingOptions` aligned with `ByteChunkingOptions`,
  enforce message and pending-byte bounds, and retain out-of-order/interleaved
  reassembly tests. WebRTC chunk sizes must remain below SCTP limits;
  WebSocket chunking also prevents large messages from monopolising a stream.

## Python boundary

- Python-specific policy belongs only in `cpp/python/` and thin Python facade
  modules. Core A11 and Thread must not know about the GIL, asyncio, pybind11,
  or Python exception classes.
- Binding callbacks may arrive from fibers, libuv, or libdatachannel threads.
  Acquire the GIL before touching Python, release it around blocking native
  waits, marshal coroutine work to its captured asyncio loop, and retain Python
  objects until completion without leaking references.
- Native `absl::Time`, `absl::Duration`, and `absl::Status` may back Python
  convenience types, but arithmetic, exceptions, reprs, and async methods must
  continue to feel native to Python.
- Synchronous binding methods returning `absl::Status` or `StatusOr` must use
  the shared status boundary so failures raise `a11.status.StatusException`;
  never expose a raw Abseil or pybind11 status exception to callers.
- Attach the Python protocol as a readable `class` body and copy it onto the
  bound native class with `a11._native_protocol.attach_protocol`, rather than a
  flat list of `NativeClass.method = _fn` assignments. Keep native descriptor
  captures (`_native_x = NativeClass.x`) as module globals before the attach,
  and keep truly-internal helpers module-level so they stay out of the stub.
  Export the public native classes with `from a11._native import X` (an import
  alias griffe and type checkers resolve to the class), not `X = _native.X`
  (an opaque attribute assignment). Field-driven option structs stay with
  `a11._native_options.install_native_options`.
- An LLM SDK client (`a11/sdk/<backend>/interact_with_*.py`) owns exactly what is
  specific to its backend: the wire shapes, the streaming accumulator that
  rebuilds a tool call from that SDK's events, and the request it builds. The
  action-call bridge is **shared** and lives in `a11/sdk/llm.py` —
  `ToolCall`, `ActionCallAdapter`, `add_tool_calls_to_interaction`,
  `decode_action_output_fragments`, `build_tool_results`, `stringify_content`,
  `encode_backend_value`. Turning a model's tool call into A11 action inputs, and
  action outputs back into text, is not a per-backend judgement, and three copies
  of it drifted apart before this was written down. A backend that shapes its
  result message differently passes a formatter to `build_tool_results` rather
  than reimplementing the loop.

## Documentation

- Docs live in `doc/` and build to `doc/site` via `doc/build.sh` (see
  `doc/README.md`): MkDocs Material + `mkdocstrings` for the Python API and
  guides, Doxygen + doxygen-awesome-css for the C++ API. The Python site
  is static — `griffe` reads `a11/` and the `a11/_native/` stubs, so no native
  build is needed to generate it. CI builds and deploys it
  (`.github/workflows/docs.yml`).
- One griffe extension in `doc/` makes the generated stubs documentable:
  `griffe_overloads.py` keeps overload-only members. A native submodule is a
  file of the stub package (`a11/_native/flow.pyi`), so
  `from a11._native.flow import X` resolves with nothing added.
- Python: Google-style docstrings. Write for a developer *building an AI agent* —
  explain the asynchronous, streaming intent and when to reach for a thing, not
  just its mechanics. Keep symbols briefly but accurately
  documented.
- C++ / pybind11: give every `.def*` real parameter names (`py::arg("...")`, not
  `arg0`) and a docstring. Keep them brief and accurate. After changing
  bindings, rebuild the extension and regenerate the `a11/_native/` stubs with
  `scripts/generate_stubs.py`; `--check` gates it in CI.
- Implementation comments are at most three lines and exist only for
  unconventional code paths or complex decisions. API docstrings retain useful
  parameter descriptions, nuanced behaviour, and in-context examples, and may
  be longer when that material cannot be stated clearly in three lines. Delete
  historical explanations and counterfactual warnings; state current
  constraints directly. All comment lines stay within 80 columns. Preserve
  licence headers verbatim, even when their required form exceeds these limits.
  Keep namespace and header-guard closing comments.
- Preserve operational comments that prevent misuse or wasted work: generated
  file warnings, regeneration commands, required call ordering, ignored-work
  explanations, and non-obvious usage constraints. These may exceed three lines
  when the complete instructions need the space, but remain within 80 columns.

## Dependencies, installation, and wheels

- Non-system C++ dependencies are statically linked. Shared objects are allowed
  only where a runtime/module boundary requires them; any such dependency must
  use loader-relative RPATH/RUNPATH and never an absolute build-machine path.
- Abseil is pinned and fetched from upstream because A11 depends on current
  status macros. Boost, OpenSSL, nghttp2, uvw/libuv, and libdatachannel targets
  must pass the static-target checks. Installed CMake targets must pass the
  out-of-tree smoke test.
- `scripts/build_wheels.py` builds architecture-specific CPython 3.11-3.14
  wheels for macOS x86_64/arm64 and Linux x86_64/aarch64. Do not emit
  `universal2` wheels: Boost.Context contains architecture-specific assembly.
- On macOS, build both macOS and Linux matrices; on Linux, Linux-only is valid.
  The dependency bootstrap builds static archives per target architecture and
  deployment target. scikit-build outputs stay in ABI-specific build trees;
  generated extensions must never enter the sdist or leak into another ABI's
  wheel.
- Every wheel must contain exactly one `a11/_native` extension and pass
  `scripts/audit_wheel.py`, which rejects non-system loader dependencies,
  absolute RPATH/RUNPATH entries, and universal wheels.

## Verification

- Build the native tree through the CMake presets (see BUILDING.md); export
  `A11_DEPS_PREFIX` first:

  ```sh
  cmake --preset debug
  cmake --build --preset debug -j 8
  ctest --preset debug
  .venv/bin/pytest -q
  scripts/smoke_cmake_install.sh
  ```

- Format C++ with the root `.clang-format`; run the configured `.clang-tidy`
  checks when the tool is available. Keep Python formatted with Black/Ruff and
  regenerate `uv.lock` after dependency or Python-version changes.
- Add regression tests at the lowest useful layer. Remove or update tests that
  assert obsolete pure-Python internals, while retaining language-native public
  behaviour and cross-language callback/error tests.
