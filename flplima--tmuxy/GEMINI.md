## CLI Usage

The `tmuxy` CLI is a noun-verb dispatcher at `bin/tmuxy-cli`, symlinked as `~/.local/bin/tmuxy`.
All mutating commands route through `tmux run-shell` for safety with control mode.

```bash
# Pane operations
tmuxy pane list [--json] [--all]       # List panes
tmuxy pane split [-h|-v]               # Split current pane
tmuxy pane kill [%id]                  # Kill pane
tmuxy pane select [-U|-D|-L|-R|%id]    # Select pane
tmuxy pane resize [-U|-D|-L|-R] [n]    # Resize pane
tmuxy pane swap %0 %1                  # Swap two panes
tmuxy pane zoom                        # Toggle zoom
tmuxy pane break                       # Break pane into own tab
tmuxy pane capture [%id] [--json]      # Capture pane content
tmuxy pane send ls Enter               # Send keys to pane
tmuxy pane paste "some text"           # Paste text into pane
tmuxy pane float [cmd args...]         # Create a float pane
tmuxy pane group add                   # Add pane to a group
tmuxy pane group close [%id]           # Close pane from group
tmuxy pane group switch %5             # Switch to pane in group
tmuxy pane group next                  # Next pane in group
tmuxy pane group prev                  # Previous pane in group

# Tab operations
tmuxy tab list [--json]                # List tabs
tmuxy tab create [name]                # Create tab (safe splitw+breakp)
tmuxy tab kill [@id]                   # Kill tab
tmuxy tab select <index|@id>           # Switch to tab
tmuxy tab next                         # Next tab
tmuxy tab prev                         # Previous tab
tmuxy tab rename <name>                # Rename current tab
tmuxy tab layout [next|even-h|...]     # Change pane layout

# Widgets
tmuxy widget image /path/to/img.png    # Display image widget
tmuxy widget markdown README.md        # Display markdown widget
echo "# Hello" | tmuxy widget markdown - # Markdown from stdin

# Event queue (inter-agent coordination)
tmuxy event emit <name> <msg|->        # Publish message (- for stdin)
tmuxy event wait <name>                # Block until message arrives
tmuxy event list                       # Show pending events

# Escape hatch (routes safely through run-shell)
tmuxy run swap-pane -s %0 -t %1       # Run any tmux command safely
tmuxy run new-window                   # Intercepted → splitw+breakp
tmuxy run resize-window                # Blocked (crashes control mode)

# Server
tmuxy server                           # Start production server
tmuxy server stop                      # Stop production server
```

Run `tmuxy --help`, `tmuxy <command> --help`, or `tmuxy <command> <subcommand> --help` for details.

## Development

```bash
npm start               # Start dev server (pm2 + cargo-watch)
npm run stop            # Stop dev server
npm test                # Unit tests (Vitest)
npm run test:e2e        # E2E tests (requires server + Chrome CDP)
```

## Devcontainer

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `CONTAINER_NAME` | Container name (e.g., `tmuxy-worktree-1`) |
| `HOST_PORT` | Port exposed on the host (e.g., `14089`) |
| `PORT` | Internal server port (`9000`) |

## Coding Guidelines

### General

1. **No legacy code** - Remove dead code immediately. No commented-out code, no unused imports.
2. **No "not doing" comments** - Comments explain what code does, not what it doesn't do.
3. **DRY** - Extract repeated logic. If you write similar code twice, refactor it.
4. **Modular helpers** - Test helpers in `helpers/` directory, organized by domain.
5. **Never modify ESLint rules** - Do not disable, remove, or weaken any ESLint rule. Do not add `eslint-disable` comments. If the user asks to disable or remove a rule, ask "Are you sure?" before proceeding.

### React + XState

1. **Avoid `useEffect`** - Side effects belong in the state machine, not components.
2. **Components are for rendering** - Business logic goes in XState machines.
3. **Derive, don't sync** - Derive values from state instead of syncing with `useEffect`.

### Tmux Control Mode (Critical)

**All tmux commands must go through the control mode stdin connection**, not via external subprocess calls. Running external `tmux` commands while control mode is attached crashes tmux 3.5a. See [docs/TMUX.md](docs/TMUX.md) for version-specific workarounds.

Use short command forms: `splitw`, `selectp`, `killp`, `resizep`, etc. **Exception:** `neww` crashes tmux 3.5a — always use `splitw ; breakp` instead (the server rewrites this automatically).

Use `adapter.invoke('run_tmux_command', { command: '...' })` for all tmux operations from the frontend. See `tmuxy-ui/src/tmux/adapters.ts` for the adapter implementations and [docs/DATA-FLOW.md](docs/DATA-FLOW.md) for the SSE/HTTP protocol details.

## Test Guidelines

**Read [docs/TESTS.md](docs/TESTS.md) before writing, reviewing, or modifying any test.** Every time you touch test code, check your work against those guidelines. Flag any test that violates them — even pre-existing tests. If you see a test asserting DOM state without visual verification, or using adapter calls instead of user paths, call it out and suggest a fix.

Key rules:

- **Test what the user sees, not what the DOM contains.** An element in the DOM but clipped by `overflow: hidden` is not visible. Always verify bounding rects, not just element existence or `textContent`.
- **Use real user paths.** If a user creates a float by typing `tmuxy pane float`, the test should type that command — not call `_exec('break-pane')`. Adapter calls skip the entire chain where bugs live.
- **One feature, one test.** Cover create → verify visible → interact → close in a single test. Do not split into separate "check state" and "check DOM" tests.
- **Never install Playwright browsers** (`npx playwright install`). Tests connect to Chrome via CDP on port 9222.
- All E2E tests run **sequentially** (`maxWorkers: 1`) — they share one tmux server.
- Copy mode is a client-side reimplementation — test it via browser keyboard events and `getCopyModeState()`, not `send-keys -X` tmux commands.

## Testing & Bug Fixes (Critical)

**ALWAYS fix any test failure or bug you encounter, even if it is unrelated to your current task or predates your changes.** Do not skip, ignore, or defer broken tests. If CI is red, make it green before moving on. A failing test is never "someone else's problem" — if you see it, you own it. This applies to unit tests, E2E tests, linting errors, type errors, and any other validation failures.

**NEVER commit skipped tests** (`it.skip`, `test.skip`, `describe.skip`, `xit`, `xtest`, `xdescribe`). If a test is failing, either fix the test, fix the underlying bug, or ask the user whether to remove the test entirely. ESLint enforces this via `jest/no-disabled-tests` (error) — the pre-commit hook and CI will reject skipped tests.

## Documentation

The `docs/` directory contains architectural and design documentation. **Review relevant docs before and after working on a task** — they provide critical context (especially `TMUX.md`, `STATE-MANAGEMENT.md`, `DATA-FLOW.md`, and `COPY-MODE.md`).

- **Before starting**: read docs related to the area you're changing. Flag any misalignment between the docs and the user's request before proceeding.
- **After finishing**: if your changes affect behavior described in docs, suggest updates to the user.
- **No project-specific code in docs**: docs should describe architecture, protocols, and conventions in prose and tables — not inline code snippets from the codebase. Code is fragile and changes constantly; docs that embed it go stale immediately. Reference file paths instead (e.g., "see `tmuxy-server/src/state.rs`").
- **Use ASCII diagrams, not Mermaid**: diagrams in docs should use plain ASCII art inside fenced code blocks. Mermaid requires a renderer and is not universally supported by all markdown viewers or AI agents.

## Git

When working on a branch other than `main`, always `git merge main` before starting work to avoid future conflicts.
