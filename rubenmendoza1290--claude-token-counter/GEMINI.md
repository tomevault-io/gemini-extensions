This file provides guidance to Google Gemini and other AI coding assistants when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Claude Token Counter is a Rust-based CLI tool that helps users monitor their Claude token usage through two approaches: (1) Real-time parsing of local Claude Code JSONL logs for all users, and (2) API-based tracking for Team/Enterprise users with Admin keys. The tool provides accurate cost estimation, beautiful terminal visualization, and comprehensive token tracking across all token types (input, output, cache creation, cache read).

```

## Architecture

### High-Level Design

The application follows a modular architecture with dual data sources:

1. **CLI Layer** (`main.rs`): Command-line interface using `clap` with derive macros. Defines four subcommands (status, history, config, live) and handles argument parsing. Contains live monitor implementation with terminal control.

2. **Local Module** (`src/local/`): Parses Claude Code JSONL logs from `~/.claude/projects/`. Recursively discovers all JSONL files, deserializes log entries, extracts token usage data, and aggregates statistics. Works for all users without requiring API keys.

3. **API Client Module** (`src/api/`): Handles communication with Anthropic Usage API. Supports two endpoints for regular API usage and Claude Code specific usage. Requires Admin API keys (Team/Enterprise only).

4. **Configuration Module** (`src/config/`): Manages API key storage and user preferences. Stores config in `~/.config/claude-token-counter/config.json` using the `dirs` crate for cross-platform home directory resolution.

5. **Display Module** (`src/display/`): Formats and presents data to the terminal using `colored` for styled output. Includes status display, history visualization, progress bars, and formatted tables.

6. **Models Module** (`src/models/`): Serde-based structs for API responses including UsageRecord, UsageResponse, and UsageSummary for aggregated statistics.

### Key Design Decisions

- **Dual-Mode Architecture**: Supports both local file parsing (universal) and API integration (enterprise), making the tool valuable for all user types
- **Local-First Approach**: Prioritizes local JSONL parsing as the primary feature since it works for all users and provides more granular data
- **Async Runtime**: Uses Tokio for async operations to handle API requests and non-blocking sleep in live monitor
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Implements live refresh using crossterm for terminal control and tokio::sleep for intervals
- **Comprehensive Token Tracking**: Tracks all token types (input, output, cache creation, cache read) for accurate cost calculation
- **Error Handling**: Uses `anyhow` for flexible error handling with context. Gracefully handles malformed JSONL lines
- **Config Storage**: Stores API keys securely in user's config directory (never in the repository)
- **CLI Framework**: Uses `clap` with derive macros for type-safe, self-documenting CLI

### Anthropic API Integration

When working with the API:
- Base URL: `https://api.anthropic.com/v1`
- Usage endpoints:
  - `/v1/organizations/usage_report/messages` - Regular API usage
  - `/v1/organizations/usage_report/claude_code` - Claude Code usage
- Requires Admin API key in `x-api-key` header
- API version header: `anthropic-version: 2023-06-01`
- Date range support with ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Only available for Team/Enterprise accounts

### Local JSONL Parsing

Claude Code stores conversation logs at `~/.claude/projects/` with structure containing message, model, usage, and timestamp fields. The local module recursively walks directories, parses JSON lines, and aggregates token usage across all files.

### Module Structure

```
src/
├── main.rs           # Entry point, CLI definition, live monitor
├── api/
│   └── mod.rs       # API client implementation
├── config/
│   └── mod.rs       # Config persistence and loading
├── display/
│   └── mod.rs       # Terminal output formatting
├── local/
│   └── mod.rs       # JSONL parsing and aggregation
└── models/
    └── mod.rs       # Data models for API responses
```

### Dependencies Rationale

- `clap 4.5`: Industry-standard CLI framework with excellent derive support
- `tokio 1.40`: De facto async runtime for Rust
- `reqwest 0.12`: High-level HTTP client built on tokio
- `serde 1.0` + `serde_json`: Standard serialization/deserialization
- `chrono 0.4`: Date/time handling for usage history and timestamps
- `colored 2.1`: Terminal color and styling
- `dirs 5.0`: Cross-platform config directory resolution
- `anyhow 1.0`: Ergonomic error handling for applications
- `notify 7.0`: File system watching (prepared for future instant updates)
- `walkdir 2.5`: Recursive directory traversal for finding JSONL files
- `crossterm 0.28`: Terminal control for live monitor screen clearing

## Key Decisions & Context

### Idea & Validation

**Core Idea**: Provide all Claude users with transparent, real-time visibility into token usage and costs, not just enterprise customers.

**Target Audience**:
- Individual developers with Claude Pro accounts
- Enterprise teams with Admin API access
- Anyone using Claude Code who wants to understand their usage

**Validation Status**: Beta release with working live monitoring feature. Successfully tested with 38M+ tokens across real projects.

### Technical Decisions

**Dual-Mode Architecture**: Implemented both local file parsing (works for everyone) and API integration (Team/Enterprise only) to maximize utility across user types.

**Local-First Strategy**: After discovering Anthropic API requires Admin keys, pivoted to prioritize local JSONL parsing as primary feature. This democratizes token tracking.

**Cost Calculation**: Implemented accurate pricing based on official Claude Sonnet 4.5 rates ($3/$15/$3.75/$0.30 per MTok for input/output/cache-write/cache-read).

**Real-Time Updates**: Used crossterm for terminal control and tokio::sleep for polling intervals. Future enhancement will add file watching for instant updates.

**Error Resilience**: Parser gracefully skips malformed JSONL lines with warnings rather than failing, ensuring tool works with imperfect data.

### Creative Strategy

**User Experience**: Focus on immediate utility - the `live` command should "just work" without configuration for most users.

**Visual Design**: Professional terminal interface with color-coded output, formatted numbers (commas), and clear hierarchical information display.

**Security Model**: Never store credentials in repository, use file system permissions, avoid credential exposure in logs or error messages.

**Accessibility**: Works for all users regardless of subscription tier or API access.

## Working Instructions

### Current Focus

The tool is now in beta with core features complete. Priority is enhancing functionality and preparing for wider release:

1. Implement file watching for instant updates (replace polling)
2. Add filtering and export capabilities
3. Create comprehensive test suite
4. Cross-platform validation
5. Set up automated builds and releases

### Development Workflow

1. **Before Coding**: Review AGENTS.md and session summary to understand current state
2. **Implementation**: Follow the module structure outlined in Architecture section
3. **Testing**: Write tests alongside implementation
4. **Documentation**: Update README and AGENTS.md as features are completed
5. **Commits**: Make atomic commits with clear messages describing what was implemented

### Code Style Guidelines

- Follow standard Rust formatting (cargo fmt)
- Address all clippy warnings
- Use descriptive variable names
- Add doc comments for public functions and modules
- Prefer explicit error handling over unwrap/expect

### Security Considerations

- API keys are stored in `~/.config/claude-token-counter/config.json`
- This file should have restricted permissions (0600)
- Never log or display full API keys
- The config file is gitignored to prevent accidental commits
- Local JSONL files may contain conversation data - handle with care
