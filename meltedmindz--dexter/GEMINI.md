   - `PositionManager.tsx`: Frontend position management interface
   - **Features**: 200 positions per address, 50 positions per batch, up to 10 ranges per vault

2. **AI Agents** (`dexter-liquidity/agents/`): Risk-based trading strategies
   - `conservative.py`: Low-risk strategy ($100k min liquidity, 15% max volatility)
   - `aggressive.py`: Medium-risk strategy ($50k min liquidity, 30% max volatility)
   - `hyper_aggressive.py`: High-risk strategy ($25k min liquidity, no volatility limit)

3. **Data Infrastructure** (`dexter-liquidity/data/`): Multi-layered data collection
   - 4-dimensional data quality monitoring (completeness, accuracy, consistency, timeliness)
   - Historical backfill service (45-180 records/minute capacity)
   - Automated gap detection and healing workflows

4. **ML Pipeline** (`backend/dexbrain/`, `/opt/dexter-ai/`): **COMPLETE** integrated intelligence system
   - **Production Deployment**: Running as `dexter-ml-pipeline.service` with 4 trained models
   - **Continuous Learning**: Auto-retraining every 30 minutes with performance tracking
   - LSTM price prediction with PyTorch
   - Real-time strategy optimization with market regime detection
   - MLflow experiment tracking and model versioning

5. **Frontend Dashboard** (`frontend/`): **PRODUCTION-READY** web interface
   - Complete vault routing: `/vaults`, `/vaults/create`, `/vaults/[address]`
   - Real-time analytics with APR, fees, impermanent loss tracking
   - AI-managed vs manual position filtering
   - Template-based vault creation workflow

6. **Uniswap V4 Hook System** (`dexter-liquidity/uniswap-v4/`): Next-generation liquidity optimization
   - `SimpleDexterHook.sol`: Production-ready V4 hook with dynamic fee management
   - Dynamic fee adjustment (0.01%-100%) based on volatility
   - ML prediction integration for real-time market regime detection
   - Gas-optimized algorithms with modular design

### Key Design Patterns
