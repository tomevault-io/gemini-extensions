## pcxa-skill

> PCXA construction intelligence platform CLI. Search/read files, manage tags and folders, manage activities/steps/progress/dependencies, manage form templates/fields/submissions, manage resources/timesheets/cost-codes/budgets, manage entity links between objects, and chat with the project's AI assistant. Use when the user asks about project files, documents, tasks, activities, forms, resources, timesheets, entity links, project management, or wants to send messages to the AI chatbot.


# PCXA CLI

**Tool:** `pcxa`

All commands output JSON by default. Use `-f table` for human-readable. Use `--dry-run` on write operations. Run `pcxa <command> --help` for full options.

When installed as a Claude Code plugin, `pcxa` is provided by the plugin `bin/` directory. For direct terminal use outside Claude Code, ask the user to install it once with:
```
pipx install git+https://github.com/PCX-Analytics/pcxa-skill.git
```
Then `pcxa update` self-upgrades from GitHub. The CLI prints a one-line notice to stderr (max once per 24h) when a newer release is available.


## Setup & Authentication

Always start by running `pcxa whoami` to see the current state. The output tells you whether the user is authenticated and whether a project is set. Only run setup steps that are actually missing.

### Step 1 — Authentication (drive it yourself, don't punt to a terminal)

If `whoami` says "No profiles configured" or a command fails with "Profile not found":

```bash
pcxa login --no-setup
```

The `--no-setup` flag is required when you (the agent) drive login: it skips the interactive company/project picker that reads stdin, which would otherwise hang. The CLI prints two lines immediately:

```
Opening browser to authenticate...
  If your browser does not open automatically, visit:
  https://www.pcxa.app/auth/cli-auth?port=PORT&state=STATE
```

**Read those lines from stdout, then surface the URL to the user as a clickable markdown link.** The CLI tries `webbrowser.open()` but that's usually a no-op in WSL/headless — the user opening the link manually is the normal path. They sign in (MFA/SSO supported), the page redirects to a localhost callback, the CLI captures tokens, the command exits.

Run with a generous bash timeout (e.g., 180s) since the user may take a moment to sign in. The CLI's own `--timeout` defaults to 120s; pass `--timeout 300` if you want longer.

If browser login isn't viable (rare — only if the host can't reach `pcxa.app`), fall back to password login: `pcxa setup -u USER_EMAIL` (prompts for password — only works if the user can run it themselves).

### Step 2 — Pick a project

After login (or if `whoami` shows `Project: not set`), drive the project picker yourself:

```bash
pcxa projects -f table       # list all (company_id, project_id) the user has access to
```

Show that list to the user, ask which project they want, then:

```bash
# When the conversation/CWD is inside a repo that maps 1:1 to a PCXA project,
# pin it locally so future runs in this repo are auto-scoped:
pcxa set-project PROJECT_ID --company COMPANY_ID --local

# Otherwise, set the global default for this user:
pcxa set-project PROJECT_ID --company COMPANY_ID
```

Always pass `--company` when picking — `--local` writes a `.pcxa` file in CWD; without `--local`, the choice is saved in the global profile.

### How resolution works

Project scope resolves in this order: **repo `.pcxa` file** > **active profile default**. `.pcxa` is committed (no secrets — just `{ "company": 4, "project": 10, "user": "alice@example.com" }`). Different repos can pin different accounts via the `user` field; the CLI matches it against profile usernames in the active credentials file.

Credentials resolve **folder-first**: a `.pcxa-credentials.json` found by walking up from CWD is used for both reads and writes (token refresh included); otherwise the global `~/.pcxa/credentials.json` is used. So `pcxa login` from inside a repo writes that repo's own `.pcxa-credentials.json` (at the git root, gitignored) and can't clobber another repo's tokens — pass `--global` to write the shared global file instead. Pre-0.3 global creds at `~/.file_explorer/config.json` are auto-migrated to `~/.pcxa/credentials.json` on first run.

State to surface to the user on the first turn: `whoami` shows `Active profile`, `User`, `Company`, `Project` (with `(from .pcxa)` annotation when applicable), `Creds:`, and `Repo pin:`. If you ran setup steps, echo the resulting scope back ("Operating on project Acme Tower (4)") so the user can correct you before any writes.

## Project Metadata

```bash
pcxa project get                                              # view project details
pcxa project members                                          # list members (name → user ID)
pcxa project members --search "John"                          # search by name/username
pcxa project update --name "New Name"                         # update name
pcxa project update --description "..." --scope-statement "..." # set description & scope
pcxa project update --code "T-FAB1" --industry "Construction" # set code & industry
pcxa project update --start-date 2025-12-03 --end-date 2026-08-10
pcxa project update --rollup-method equal                     # equal|duration|cost|labor
pcxa project update --progress-input-method percentage        # status|percentage
```

Fields: `name`, `code` (max 20), `description`, `scope-statement`, `industry`, `life-cycle`, `start-date`, `end-date`, `progress-input-method`, `rollup-method`.

## File Search & Reading

```bash
pcxa files list --ext PDF --search "keyword" --limit 50  # title trigram (fuzzy by default; exact first)
pcxa files list --search "concret" --exact               # tight substring only — `concret` will NOT match `Concrete`
pcxa files list --tags "urgent,review" --tags-mode all   # AND: files with ALL tags
pcxa files search "natural language query"                    # hybrid BM25 + semantic (same endpoint as the web UI)
pcxa files search "query" --scope file,activity               # restrict source types (csv: file,activity,drawing,photo)
pcxa files search "query" --ext PDF --limit 25                # narrow to file type, page-size up to 50
pcxa files content "BRG report" --ext PDF                     # alias of `files search` scoped to files (same hybrid endpoint)
pcxa files read FILE_ID --outline                             # section map
pcxa files read FILE_ID                                       # first 5 chunks
pcxa files read FILE_ID --start 5                             # next window
pcxa files batch-read 423 511 612 --window 3                  # multi-file in one call
pcxa files batch-read --chunk 423:7 --chunk 511:12            # excerpts at specific chunks
pcxa files batch-read 423 511 --outline                       # outlines, multi-file
pcxa files info FILE_ID                                       # metadata + versions
pcxa files stats                                              # project-wide counts
pcxa files aggregate file_type                                # group by dimension
pcxa files recent --limit 30
pcxa files download FILE_ID                              # download to current dir
pcxa files download FILE_ID -o report.pdf                # custom output path
pcxa files upload /path/to/file.pdf --folder 5 --title "Report" --tags "final,2026"
pcxa files upload /path/to/dir/ --folder 5               # bulk upload all files in dir (flat)
pcxa files sync /path/to/tree --folder 5                 # recursive mirror; creates subfolders; idempotent
pcxa files sync /path/to/tree --folder 5 --manifest .pcxa-sync.json   # persist upload log for fast re-runs
pcxa files sync /path/to/tree --folder 5 --include "*.pdf" --exclude "draft_*" --concurrency 16
pcxa files delete 123 124 --yes                          # mark for deletion (adds 'to_delete' tag)
pcxa files restore 123 124                               # remove 'to_delete' tag (undo)
pcxa files list --tags to_delete                         # list everything pending deletion
```

**Upload storage:** Small files are uploaded through the API. Larger files use a presigned upload flow handled by the CLI and API.

**Bulk tree sync (`files sync`):** Mirrors a local directory tree under a PCXA folder. Walks the tree, creates any missing subfolders to match, and uploads files in parallel via the same presign+PUT/multipart path as `files upload`. Idempotent two ways: it lists each target folder once and skips local files whose name already exists there, and an optional `--manifest <path>` persists `{relative_path → {size, file_id}}` so re-runs skip without hitting the API. Failures (network, register errors) are listed at the end and counted toward `error` rate. Progress is rendered live on stderr: a bar plus files-done, bytes-done/total, throughput, current concurrency (`c=N`), elapsed, ETA, and error count. Filters: `--include` and `--exclude` accept repeatable globs against filenames; dotfiles/dot-dirs are skipped by default (`--include-hidden` opts in).

**Designed for TB-scale runs:**
- **Auto-tuning concurrency** (default ON): an AIMD controller samples throughput and error rate every 10s and adjusts active workers via a runtime-resizable semaphore. Errors halve concurrency with a 30s cooldown; clean windows with rising throughput step it up. Bound by `--min-concurrency` / `--max-concurrency` (default 1 / 32). Pass `--no-auto-tune` to pin concurrency at `--concurrency` for the whole run. Tuner decisions print above the progress line so you can see what's happening.
- **Failure-budget circuit breaker** (`--max-failures`, default 100): aborts the run cleanly if cumulative errors hit the budget, so a misconfigured target folder doesn't burn hours of bandwidth. Set `0` to disable.
- **Pre-flight folder check**: `GET /folders/{id}/` runs before walking, so an inaccessible target ID fails fast instead of mid-run.
- **Adaptive multipart part-size**: per-file `part_size` is bumped automatically if the file would exceed R2's 10000-part cap (relevant for files > ~160 GB at the 16 MB default).
- **Time-based manifest checkpoints**: manifest flushes every 50 uploads *or* every 30s, whichever comes first — a crash mid-run loses at most ~30s of progress.
- **Resume messaging**: when the manifest already has entries, the run prints "Resuming from manifest: N files already recorded." up front.
- **`--part-concurrency`** (default 4) decouples parts-per-file parallelism from files-in-flight parallelism, so 16 concurrent multipart files don't spawn 16 × 16 = 256 PUTs.
- **`--limit N`** stops after queueing N files (post-filtering). Useful for graduated smoke tests before committing to a multi-hour run; the manifest is still written so the next run resumes exactly where this one stopped.

**Deletion convention:** `pcxa files delete <ids>` marks files for deletion by applying the `to_delete` tag. Use `pcxa files restore <ids>` to undo before cleanup runs. Without `--yes`, `delete` prompts for confirmation.

Search results include `url` fields — always show these to users for document links.

**`--search` is fuzzy by default (`files list`, `files aggregate`, `activities list`).** Backend uses PostgreSQL trigram similarity: exact substring matches surface first (similarity ~1.0), then typo-tolerant matches ranked by similarity DESC, in a single paginated response. `concret` finds `Concrete Pour`; `0314` ranks `RFI-0314` above `Document-031499`. Pass `--exact` to opt back into tight substring matching (rejects typos — useful when the query is a known-correct identifier and you don't want fuzzy noise). The backend rate-limits fuzzy search to 100/min per user; not normally a concern for agent use.

**Search response shape:** `pcxa files search` returns `{query, total_results, results, hybrid_enabled}` — a top-N reranked list (server-capped at 50). Each row carries `score`, `file_id`/`activity_id`, `file_name`/`title`, `folder_path`, `page_number`, `chunk_position`, and a `url`. Hybrid means the result is the union of Pinecone semantic similarity and BM25 over the project's chunk text, RRF-fused and Cohere-reranked — the same path the web UI's search bar uses.

**After search → read in batch.** Once `files search` returns the rows, prefer `files batch-read --chunk file_id:chunk_position` over N single `files read` calls. Each row carries a `chunk_position` — pass `file_id:chunk_position` as `--chunk` to read just the relevant excerpt + neighbors. One round trip instead of N. Use `--outline` for section maps when files are large and you need to plan further reads.

For folder-scoped browsing, use `pcxa files list --folder <id>`.

## Tags & Folders

```bash
pcxa tags list                                                # all tags with counts
pcxa tags add 1 2 3 --tags urgent,review                      # add (preserves existing)
pcxa tags remove 1 2 --tags draft                             # remove specific tags
pcxa tags set 1 2 --tags final,approved                       # replace all tags
pcxa folders tree --depth 2                                   # hierarchy
pcxa folders create "Contracts" --parent 5                    # new folder
pcxa folders rename 5 "Legal"                                 # rename
pcxa folders move 5 --parent 10                               # reparent
pcxa folders contents 5                                       # subfolders + files (paginated; --timeout for slow folders)
pcxa folders subfolders 5                                     # lightweight [{id,name}] list (fast on large folders)
pcxa folders delete 5                                         # delete + all contents
pcxa move 10 11 12 --folder 5                                 # bulk move files
pcxa categorize 10 11 --category "Submittal"                  # bulk set category
pcxa files update 10 --title "New" --tags a,b --folder 5      # single file update
```

## Activities

```bash
pcxa activities list --status in_progress --priority 3,4
pcxa activities list --search "foundation" --assignee 5 --sort -due_date  # fuzzy by default; add --exact for tight
pcxa activities list --tags "structural,review" --tags-mode all  # AND mode
pcxa activities list --after 2026-03-01 --before 2026-03-31       # updated in date range
pcxa activities list --after last_month                          # relative dates supported
pcxa activities list --created-after 2026-01-01 --created-before 2026-03-31
pcxa activities list --assignee 5 --after 2026-03-01 --before 2026-03-31  # user's work in period
pcxa activities get 123                                       # detail + steps + deps
pcxa activities create --title "Review" --priority 3 --type 5 --assignees 1,2
pcxa activities update 123 --status completed --percent 100
pcxa activities delete 123 456                                # bulk delete
pcxa activities bulk-update 1 2 3 --status in_progress
pcxa activities types                                         # list templates
```

**Statuses:** `not_started`, `in_progress`, `completed` | **Priority:** 0=none, 1=low, 2=med, 3=high, 4=critical

**Descriptions support Markdown** (headings, tables, bold, lists). Keep descriptions focused on:
- **Scope/objective** — what the activity is and what it produces
- **Requestor** — who asked for it, with reference to source communication (e.g., `file:247764`)
- **Business justification** — why this work exists

Do NOT put in descriptions: processing details, scripts, output file lists, status updates, or progress notes. Those belong in **comments** (`pcxa comments add`) as dated narrative entries.

**Date filters:** `--after`/`--before` filter by last updated; `--created-after`/`--created-before` filter by creation date. Accepts `YYYY-MM-DD` or relative keywords: `today`, `last_7_days`, `this_month`, `last_quarter`, etc.

**Name resolution:** `--assignee` and `--owner` accept user IDs or names. Names are fuzzy-matched against project members:
- Exact/substring match → resolves automatically with confirmation message
- Multiple close matches → lists candidates with IDs for you to pick
- No match → suggests `pcxa project members` to list all

**Invoicing workflow:** Query a user's activity in a billing period by name — no `--status` filter needed since `--after`/`--before` captures any work (started, progressed, or completed):
```bash
pcxa activities list --assignee "John" --after 2026-03-01 --before 2026-03-31
```

## Steps (Subtasks)

When steps exist, activity progress auto-calculates from weighted step completion.

```bash
pcxa steps list 123                                           # list steps
pcxa steps create 123 --name "Draft review" --weight 40
pcxa steps update 123 45 --percent 100                        # mark step complete
pcxa steps delete 123 45                                      # weights rebalance
pcxa steps from-template 123                                  # create from type template
```

## Progress

```bash
pcxa progress list 123                                        # progress timeline
pcxa progress add 123 --percent 50 --notes "Halfway"
pcxa progress add 123 --percent 25 --date 2026-03-15          # backdate
pcxa progress delete 123 789                                  # manual entries only
```

## Comments

```bash
pcxa comments list 3712                                       # list comments on activity
pcxa comments add 3712 --content "[2026-03-16] Drafting initiated..."
pcxa comments delete 3712 2952                                # delete comment by ID
pcxa comments bulk 3712 --file comments.json                  # bulk add from JSON file
```

**Bulk JSON format** (`comments.json`):
```json
[
  {"content": "[2026-03-16] Drafting initiated per weekly report #12"},
  {"content": "[2026-03-23] Internal review completed, minor revisions needed"}
]
```

Supports both bare list and wrapper object with `"comments"` key.

## Dependencies (CPM)

Types: `FS` (finish-to-start), `SS`, `FF`, `SF`. Lag in days (negative = lead).

```bash
pcxa deps list --predecessor 10
pcxa deps create --predecessor 10 --successor 20 --type FS --lag 2
pcxa deps delete 456
```

## Gantt & WBS Tree

```bash
pcxa gantt --status in_progress
pcxa tree --max-depth 3
```

## Forms (Templates)

Form templates define reusable forms with typed fields. Submissions are instances of a form.

```bash
pcxa forms list --category Safety                     # list templates
pcxa forms list --scope project --search "inspection"
pcxa forms get 1                                      # detail + fields
pcxa forms create --name "Safety Inspection" --category Safety --code-prefix SI --code-padding 3
pcxa forms update 1 --description "Updated desc" --reviewers 3,5
pcxa forms delete 1
```

**Scope:** `project` (default) or `company`. **Code settings:** `code-prefix` (e.g. RFI), `code-scope` (project/company), `code-separator` (default: -), `code-padding` (3=001).

## Fields (Form Fields)

Fields define the structure of a form template. Field values are referenced by field ID in submissions.

```bash
pcxa fields list 1                                    # list fields for form 1
pcxa fields create 1 --label "Inspector" --type text --required --order 1
pcxa fields create 1 --label "Severity" --type select --options '{"choices":["Low","Med","High"]}'
pcxa fields create 1 --label "Date" --type date --required --order 2
pcxa fields update 1 5 --label "New Label" --required true
pcxa fields delete 1 5
```

**Field types:** `text`, `textarea`, `date`, `select`, `checkbox`, `number`, `email`, `phone`, `url`, `file`, `signature`, etc.

## Submissions (Form Submissions)

Submissions are instances of a form template, with field values keyed by field ID.

```bash
pcxa submissions list --form 1                        # list for a specific form
pcxa submissions list --status draft                  # filter by status
pcxa submissions get 1 42                             # detail (form_id submission_id)
pcxa submissions create 1 --code SI-001 --values '{"1":"John","2":"2026-03-24","3":"High"}'
pcxa submissions update 1 42 --values '{"3":"Critical"}' --tags urgent
pcxa submissions delete 1 42
```

**Statuses:** `draft`, `submitted`, `closed`. Values are JSON objects mapping field IDs to values.

## Resources

Resources represent people, equipment, consumables, or subcontractors assigned to activities.

```bash
pcxa resources list --type personnel --active true
pcxa resources get 1                                  # detail with rates
pcxa resources create --name "John Smith" --type personnel --user 5
pcxa resources create --name "Crane #3" --type equipment --unit hours --capacity 10
pcxa resources update 1 --name "John D. Smith" --active false
pcxa resources delete 1
```

**Types:** `personnel`, `equipment`, `consumable`, `subcontractor` | **Units:** `hours`, `days`, `each`, `lump_sum`

Only `personnel` resources can link to a user (`--user`). Use `--user 0` to unlink.

## Rates (Resource Rates)

Append-only rate history. Create new rates with new effective dates — no updates/deletes.

```bash
pcxa rates list 1                                     # rates for resource 1
pcxa rates create 1 --effective-date 2026-04-01 --standard-rate 75 --cost-rate 50 --bill-rate 100
pcxa rates create 1 --effective-date 2026-04-01 --standard-rate 75 --cost-rate 50 --bill-rate 100 --overtime-rate 112.50
```

## Assignments (Resource → Activity)

```bash
pcxa assignments list 123                             # list for activity 123
pcxa assignments create 123 --resource 5 --planned-units 40 --role "Lead Engineer"
pcxa assignments create 123 --resource 8 --planned-units 80 --curve front_loaded --driving
pcxa assignments update 123 45 --remaining 20 --at-completion 50
pcxa assignments delete 123 45
```

**Curves:** `uniform`, `front_loaded`, `back_loaded`, `bell`

## Cost Codes (Company-Scoped)

Hierarchical cost tracking codes shared across all projects.

```bash
pcxa cost-codes list --root-only
pcxa cost-codes get 1                                 # detail with children
pcxa cost-codes create --code "03.300" --name "Cast-in-Place Concrete"
pcxa cost-codes create --code "03.310" --name "Structural" --parent 1
pcxa cost-codes update 1 --active false
pcxa cost-codes delete 1
```

## Budgets (Cost Code Budgets)

```bash
pcxa budgets list
pcxa budgets create --cost-code 1 --amount 50000 --units 200
pcxa budgets update 1 --amount 75000
pcxa budgets delete 1
```

## Timesheets

Time/cost tracking per resource with approval workflow: `draft` → `submitted` → `approved` | `rejected` → `draft`.

```bash
pcxa timesheets list --status draft --resource 5
pcxa timesheets list --after 2026-03-01 --before 2026-03-31
pcxa timesheets get 1                                 # detail with all entries
pcxa timesheets create --resource 5 --period-start 2026-03-24 --period-end 2026-03-30 --period-type weekly
pcxa timesheets update 1 --period-end 2026-03-31
pcxa timesheets delete 1
pcxa timesheets submit 1                              # draft → submitted
pcxa timesheets approve 1                             # submitted → approved
pcxa timesheets reject 1 --reason "Missing entries"   # submitted → rejected
pcxa timesheets reopen 1                              # rejected → draft
```

**Period types:** `weekly`, `biweekly`, `monthly`. Only draft/rejected timesheets are editable.

## Time Entries (nested under timesheets)

```bash
pcxa entries list 1                                   # entries for timesheet 1
pcxa entries list 1 --date 2026-03-25 --activity 123
pcxa entries create 1 --activity 123 --date 2026-03-25 --hours 8
pcxa entries create 1 --activity 123 --date 2026-03-25 --hours 2 --type overtime --cost-code 5
pcxa entries update 1 42 --hours 6 --description "Half day"
pcxa entries delete 1 42
```

**Types:** `regular`, `overtime`, `double_time` | Hours: 0.01–24

## Cost Entries (nested under timesheets)

```bash
pcxa cost-entries list 1
pcxa cost-entries create 1 --resource 8 --activity 123 --date 2026-03-25 --quantity 5 --unit-cost 200
pcxa cost-entries update 1 42 --quantity 10
pcxa cost-entries delete 1 42
```

`total_cost` auto-computed: `quantity × unit_cost`.

## Time Period Locks

Lock date ranges to prevent edits.

```bash
pcxa locks list
pcxa locks create --period-start 2026-03-01 --period-end 2026-03-15 --reason "Month closed"
pcxa locks delete 1
```

## Links (Entity Links)

Connect any two objects (files, activities, photos, drawings) with contextual descriptions. Object references use `type:id` format.

**Types:** `file`, `activity`, `photo`, `drawing`, `source_document`, `project`

```bash
pcxa links list --source file:170106                  # links from a file
pcxa links list --target activity:3710                # links to an activity
pcxa links list --source file:170106 --target activity:3710  # specific pair
pcxa links create --source file:170106 --target file:170107 --type attachment
pcxa links create --source activity:3710 --target file:170106 --type deliverable
pcxa links create --source file:170129 --target file:170100 --type "supersedes" --description "Corrected analysis"
pcxa links delete 42
pcxa links bulk --file links.json                     # bulk create from JSON
```

**Bulk JSON format** (`links.json`):
```json
[
  {"source": "file:170106", "target": "file:170107", "type": "attachment"},
  {"source": "activity:3710", "target": "file:170106", "description": "RFI analysis deliverable"},
  {"source_type": "file", "source_id": 170129, "target_type": "file", "target_id": 170100, "type": "supersedes"}
]
```

The `--type` flag sets the description field (the backend doesn't enforce typed relationships). Use `--description` for longer context. Both shorthand (`"source": "file:123"`) and explicit (`"source_type": "file", "source_id": 123`) formats work in bulk JSON.

## AI Chat

Send messages to the project's AI assistant and read back its replies. Useful for ad-hoc probing and for letting an agent evaluate chatbot response quality. Project-scoped — uses the `.pcxa` company/project.

```bash
pcxa chat send "What is the status of the foundation work?"          # uses current conversation, waits for reply
pcxa chat send "..." --new --title "Eval run 1"                      # fresh conversation
pcxa chat send "..." --conversation 123                              # continue an existing thread
pcxa chat send "..." --research                                      # enable file-search tools (research_mode)
pcxa chat send "..." --model gemini-2.5-pro                          # override model (see chat models)
pcxa chat send "..." --no-wait                                       # fire-and-forget; returns agent_task_id
pcxa chat send "..." --timeout 300                                   # polling timeout (default 180s)

pcxa chat ls --search "RFI"                                          # list conversations
pcxa chat get [ID]                                                    # show full transcript (default: current)
pcxa chat get 123 --show-tools                                        # include tool calls
pcxa chat new --title "Probe"                                         # create empty conversation
pcxa chat delete 123                                                  # soft-delete (archive)
pcxa chat models                                                      # list available models
```

**Default JSON output** (from `chat send`):
```json
{
  "conversation_id": 42,
  "agent_task_id": 9001,
  "agent_task_status": "completed",
  "elapsed_seconds": 14.2,
  "timed_out": false,
  "user_message": {"id": 500, "content": "..."},
  "assistant_message": {
    "id": 501, "role": "assistant", "content": "...",
    "tool_steps": [...], "thinking_steps": [...], "action_cards": [...]
  }
}
```

**How it works:** `chat send` submits a message, waits for the platform's assistant task to finish, and returns the assistant response. Exit code 2 means the task failed. `--no-wait` skips polling and returns the task ID immediately.

## Reporting API errors

When a PCXa CLI command returns a non-2xx API response, surface the endpoint, status code, and response body to the user. Do not invent alternate data paths; ask the user how they want to proceed.

## Invocation

`/pcxa $ARGUMENTS` → `pcxa $ARGUMENTS` (if installed via pipx) or `python .claude/skills/pcxa/pcxa.py $ARGUMENTS`
