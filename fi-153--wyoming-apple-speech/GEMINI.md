# Wyoming Apple Speech

A Wyoming protocol STT + TTS server that bridges macOS on-device speech recognition (Apple's
Speech framework) and Siri text-to-speech to Home Assistant's Voice pipeline.

## Project Components

- **swift/Sources/AppleSTT/** — Swift CLI tool (`apple-stt`) that reads PCM audio from stdin and
  outputs transcribed text as JSON.
  Uses SpeechAnalyzer on macOS 26+ and SFSpeechRecognizer on older systems.
  With `--worker` it runs as a persistent streaming worker instead: framed JSON commands on
  stdin (`transcribe` → `audio`+PCM payload → `stop`), `ready`/`partial`/`final`/`error`
  JSON lines on stdout (`WorkerMode.swift`, `StreamingSession.swift`). The binary must be
  re-signed after building (`codesign -f -s -`, done by the Makefile) so the embedded
  Info.plist's speech-recognition usage description is bound into the signature — TCC
  SIGABRTs the process otherwise. When launched from a terminal/IDE shell, TCC attributes
  the speech-recognition request to the *responsible process* (the terminal), so test
  worker mode via launchd (`launchctl submit`) or the installed service.
  - `LocaleMatching.swift` — pure function `bestMatchingLocale(for:in:)` for resolving bare
    language codes (e.g. "en") to full locales (e.g. "en-US") against `SpeechTranscriber.supportedLocales`.
  - `SupportedLanguages.swift` — pure function `languageCodes(from:)` for extracting deduplicated,
    sorted short language codes from a list of locales. Used by `--list-languages` CLI flag.
  - `swift/Tests/AppleSTTTests/` — Swift unit tests (Swift Testing framework).
- **swift/Sources/AppleTTS/** — Swift CLI tool (`apple-tts`) exposing the private Siri synthesis
  engine (`SiriTTSService.framework`). Runs as a long-lived worker: JSON commands on stdin,
  JSON-header + binary PCM frames on stdout. `--list-voices` prints the system-managed Siri
  voices (the only ones that reliably load; see `context/planning/add-siri-tts-streaming.md`
  for the engine's lifecycle constraints — engines are never deallocated, init failures are
  process-fatal by design).
  - `swift/Tests/AppleTTSTests/` — voice-specifier parsing and asset-discovery tests.
- **wyoming_apple_speech/** — Python Wyoming protocol server. Handles TCP connections from Home
  Assistant. For STT, `stt.py` keeps a pool of pre-warmed `apple-stt --worker` processes
  (mirroring the TTS pool design); the handler streams audio chunks into a worker session as
  they arrive, forwards partial transcripts as `transcript-chunk` events, and emits the final
  transcript right after `audio-stop`. Any streaming failure falls back to the buffered
  one-shot transcription path (audio is always buffered in parallel). For TTS, `tts.py`
  keeps a pool of pre-warmed `apple-tts` workers (acquire triggers a background replacement
  spawn) and the handler serves both legacy `synthesize` and streaming
  `synthesize-start/chunk/stop` with sentence-level incremental synthesis.
- **scripts/** — Install and uninstall scripts for the launchd service.
- **packaging/** — Release tooling: `build-release-tarball.sh` produces the
  GitHub release artifact; `formula.rb.template` + `python-resources.rb` are
  rendered by CI into the Homebrew formula.

## Key References

- **Code style:** [`context/styling/formatting.md`](context/styling/formatting.md) — naming, formatting, docstrings for Swift and Python

## Make Targets

All development commands go through the Makefile. **Always use `make` commands** instead of
invoking tools directly.

```bash
make            # Show help with all available targets
make venv       # Create Python venv and install dev dependencies
make build      # Build the Swift CLI binary
make test       # Run Python tests (creates venv if needed)
make swift-test # Run Swift unit tests (LocaleMatching, etc.)
make run        # Run the server locally (builds everything first)
make stop       # Stop the server running on PORT
make install    # Install as launchd service
make uninstall  # Remove the launchd service and files
make clean      # Remove build artifacts and venv
```

**Important**: Never run `pytest`, `swift build`, or `pip install` directly. Always use the
corresponding `make` target. This ensures the correct venv, paths, and build flags are used.

## Planning Workflow

All plans live under `context/planning/`. The design plan and implementation plan for a given task
**must** be in the same file — design first, implementation checklist appended below after approval.

Whenever the user asks Claude to plan a task, Claude **must** write the plan as a `.md` file inside
`context/planning/` before doing any implementation work. File names must be descriptive kebab-case
(e.g., `implement-upload-endpoint.md`). After writing the plan, Claude notifies the user of the file
path and waits for explicit approval before proceeding. The user may edit the plan file directly
using `/user <comment>` annotations; When new additions to the plan are made in response to comments
mark them with `/new`; Delete all the `/new` already present in a plan when updating or adding the
todo list; implementation begins only after the user explicitly approves. Plans are kept locally
and excluded from git via .gitignore.

**Asking Questions** ALWAYS ask any clarifying questions you need and avoid assumptions unless
asked otherwise.

**Important**: When writing a plan, include ONLY the architectural design and approach — no
implementation checklists or checkboxes. The user will ask for implementation steps separately
after approving the plan. Do not add execution details, step numbering, or checkbox lists unless
the user explicitly requests them.

Once a plan is approved and the user asks for implementation steps, Claude must create an
implementation checklist in the plan file. After implementation begins, Claude must follow the
checklist in order, checking each box (`- [x]`) immediately upon completing the corresponding task.

When implementing new methods always add docstrings in accordance to the directives under
the context/styling guidelines.

**Test-Driven Development**: Always write tests before implementation code. Write a failing test
first, then write the minimal code to make it pass, then refactor. This applies to all new
Python server-side functionality. Swift CLI code is tested independently with PCM fixture files.
Use the `superpowers:test-driven-development` skill when implementing features or bugfixes.

**No Auto-Commits**: Never run `git commit`, `git push`, or any git write operations unless
the user explicitly asks. Stage and commit decisions are always the user's to make.

## Releasing

Releases are tag-driven and split into two channels by the tag's shape. To cut a
**stable** release:

```bash
git tag v<major>.<minor>.<patch>
git push origin v<major>.<minor>.<patch>
```

To cut a **beta** release, add a `-beta.<n>` suffix:

```bash
git tag v<major>.<minor>.<patch>-beta.<n>   # e.g. v1.2.0-beta.1
git push origin v<major>.<minor>.<patch>-beta.<n>
```

Both match the same `v*` trigger; the workflow branches on the `-beta` suffix.

The `.github/workflows/release.yml` workflow then:

1. Runs `make swift-test` and aborts on failure.
2. Builds the universal Swift binary via `packaging/build-release-tarball.sh` and
   assembles `wyoming-apple-speech-<version>.tar.gz`.
3. Creates a GitHub release named after the tag and uploads the tarball as the
   sole asset — marked as a **prerelease** for beta tags.
4. Renders `packaging/formula.rb.template` with the new version, URL, sha256, class
   name, and a `conflicts_with` directive (emitted only when the other channel's
   formula exists in the tap — brew warns on conflicts with unknown formulae), then
   pushes the result to
   `FI-153/homebrew-tap`. Stable tags write `Formula/wyoming-apple-speech.rb` (class
   `WyomingAppleSpeech`); beta tags write a separate `Formula/wyoming-apple-speech-beta.rb`
   (class `WyomingAppleSpeechBeta`), so the two channels coexist in the tap and never
   overwrite each other.

The beta uses a `-beta` suffix rather than `@beta` because Homebrew derives a formula's
Ruby class name from its filename and only maps `@` to `AT` before a digit
(`python@3.12`), so `wyoming-apple-speech@beta` would be an invalid class. Users install the
beta with `brew install FI-153/tap/wyoming-apple-speech-beta`; the two formulae
`conflicts_with` each other, so only one channel is active at a time.

Requirements:

- The `TAP_PUSH_TOKEN` secret must be configured in repo **Settings → Secrets and
  variables → Actions**. It is a fine-grained PAT scoped to `FI-153/homebrew-tap`
  with `contents: write`. Never commit the token to the repo.
- Python `resource` blocks live in `packaging/python-resources.rb`. When
  `pyproject.toml` runtime dependencies change, regenerate that file:

  ```bash
  python3 -m venv /tmp/poet-venv
  /tmp/poet-venv/bin/pip install homebrew-pypi-poet wyoming
  /tmp/poet-venv/bin/poet wyoming > packaging/python-resources.rb
  rm -rf /tmp/poet-venv
  ```

- No file in the repo carries a version. The git tag is the single source of truth;
  `pyproject.toml`'s `version` is static at `0.0.0` and cosmetic only.
