subrouter is like OpenRouter, but for **personal AI subscriptions**. Most users pay for several subscriptions (Claude Pro/Max, ChatGPT Plus/Pro, SuperGrok / Grok Build, Cursor, opencode Go). When one runs out of credits, the user has to stop working, switch models in every harness, and re-login constantly. subrouter fixes both problems:

- it cycles through multiple subscriptions when one runs out of credits
- it cycles between subscriptions of **different providers**, following the user's preferred ranking, and only errors when every subscription is exhausted

**Personal use only.** Using subrouter to serve tenant/third-party traffic is against the terms of use of most (if not all) subscription providers. Never add features that encourage multi-tenant serving.

## Core design principle: transparent API passthrough

subrouter must **never translate between AI wire formats**. This is the main robustness property of the project; protect it in every change.

- The router (`RouterModel`) delegates `doGenerate`/`doStream` directly to official `@ai-sdk/*` provider packages (`@ai-sdk/anthropic`, `@ai-sdk/openai`, `@ai-sdk/xai`, `@ai-sdk/openai-compatible`). The result streams/objects are returned to the harness **untouched**.
- Format understanding is the harness's job, wired through `@subrouter/opencode` and `@subrouter/pi`. OpenCode uses the AI SDK. Pi uses its native provider streams. Subrouter only picks *which* subscription serves the request.
- Adapters only touch requests where the subscription gateway **requires** it, and any rewrite must be reversed on the way out:
  - anthropic: OAuth traffic must look like Claude Code CLI (identity system block, tool-name renames, beta headers). The response stream maps tool names **back** to the originals, so the harness never sees the spoofing.
  - openai (Codex backend): `store: false` forced, `max_output_tokens` stripped, URL rewritten to `chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex/responses`. These are hard endpoint requirements (verified against the real API), not conveniences. Codex is stream-only.
  - xai / opencode zen / poe / minimax / kimi / zai / alibaba: bearer injection only.
  - github-copilot: bearer injection, API-family routing, and removal of the unsupported Anthropic tool-streaming field.
- The Pi plugin does not use these AI SDK request adapters. It supplies the selected account token to Pi's matching native provider, which owns the required request shape and returns native Pi events.
- Never add "smart" body transformations, prompt mutation, output post-processing, or cross-format proxying (no anthropic→openai translation like generic LLM proxies do). If a provider needs a new quirk, implement the **minimal** request patch in that provider's adapter fetch, document why, and keep everything else byte-transparent.

### Why protocol ownership stays in the harness

Subrouter is a **transparent subscription router**, not a general-purpose compatibility API. It chooses an account and model, then delegates the complete request and stream lifecycle to the protocol implementation that the harness already uses:

- OpenCode delegates through the matching official AI SDK provider. Subrouter returns the provider's `LanguageModelV3` result without converting it to another provider format.
- Pi delegates through `@earendil-works/pi-ai`'s matching native provider. Pi builds the provider request, parses SSE or WebSocket responses, and emits native Pi events. Subrouter forwards those events unchanged.

Do not add a unified message, tool, reasoning, usage, or streaming protocol inside Subrouter. General API gateways such as OpenRouter and CLIProxyAPI need bidirectional translators because they let one client protocol call many different provider protocols. That broader goal requires request converters, response converters, and stateful stream parsers for every supported format pair.

Subrouter deliberately avoids that translation matrix. Reusing the harness's provider implementations keeps the package small and removes whole classes of bugs involving tool calls, reasoning blocks, media, usage accounting, event ordering, and new provider fields. A provider-specific gateway requirement is still allowed, but patch only that requirement and never turn the adapter into a general format converter.

## Repo layout

pnpm workspace, flat `./*` packages. **One root README only, no per-package READMEs.**

- `cli/` — npm package `@subrouter/cli`. Everything lives here:
  - `src/store.ts` — accounts, presets, cooldown state under `~/.subrouter` (override: `SUBROUTER_HOME`). JSON files, 0600, lock-dir locking.
  - `src/adapters/` — one adapter per provider (login flow, token refresh, fetch wrapper, `createModel`). Shared failure classification in `adapters/index.ts`.
  - `src/router.ts` — `RouterModel` (AI SDK `LanguageModelV3`) + `createSubrouter` provider factory. Resolves a preset to ranked candidates, skips cooldowns, fails over on rotate-worthy errors.
  - `src/cli.ts` — goke CLI (`login`, `logout`, `account`, `preset`, `status`, `cooldown clear`).
- `opencode/` — npm package `@subrouter/opencode`. Plugin `config` hook injects a `subrouter` provider whose `npm` field is a `file://` URL to the bundled `provider.js`; every preset becomes a model (`subrouter/<preset>`). Only plugin initializers may be exported from `src/index.ts` (opencode calls every export as a plugin).
- `pi/` — npm package `@subrouter/pi`. Registers one native Pi provider and one logical model per preset. It selects accounts, then delegates to Pi's built-in provider streams without translating events.
- `website/` — Holocron docs site deployed to subrouter.org.

## npm package naming: everything lives in the @subrouter scope

**Every published package MUST be scoped under `@subrouter`.** There is no exception.

The unscoped name `subrouter` on npm is **not ours**. It belongs to a third party:

```
$ npm view subrouter maintainers repository.url
maintainers = 'lawrencechen <lawrencechen2002@gmail.com>'
repository.url = 'git+https://github.com/manaflow-ai/subrouter.git'
```

That package is unrelated to this repo. We can never publish to it, and we must never tell users to install it.

### Rules

- **Never write `npm i -g subrouter`** or `npx subrouter` in a README, docs page, error message, or CLI output. It installs a stranger's package.
- **Never name a workspace package `subrouter`** (unscoped) in `package.json`.
- New packages get `@subrouter/<name>`, matching their folder where possible.

### Naming is separate from the binary and the provider id

Scoping the package does not change any user-facing identifier. Keep these as the bare word `subrouter`:

| Thing | Value | Where |
|---|---|---|
| CLI binary | `subrouter` | `bin` field, so `subrouter login` keeps working |
| opencode provider id | `subrouter` | `cli/src/router.ts` |
| state directory | `~/.subrouter` | `SUBROUTER_HOME` |
| env var prefix | `SUBROUTER_*` | adapters |

Only the **npm package name** must be scoped.

### The bin field must use the object form

Scoped packages derive the binary name from the package name with the scope stripped, so the string form (`"bin": "dist/cli.js"`) would install a binary called `cli`:

```json
"bin": {
  "subrouter": "dist/cli.js"
}
```

### Renaming touches three importers at once

`@subrouter/opencode` resolves the engine by package name:

```
opencode/package.json      "@subrouter/cli": "workspace:^"
opencode/src/provider.ts   export { createSubrouter } from '@subrouter/cli'
opencode/src/index.ts      import { DEFAULT_PRESET_NAME, loadPresets } from '@subrouter/cli'
```

The harness packages depend on `@subrouter/cli` with `workspace:^`.

## Config is implicit and machine-only

Users never hand-edit config files. All state is created through the CLI (`subrouter login`, `subrouter preset create`). Do not add a user-facing editable config file. The `default` preset is built in: a hardcoded ranking of the newest model per provider, filtered to providers with accounts. A user preset named `default` overrides the builtin. Presets appear in both harnesses as `subrouter/<name>`.

## Cooldowns are global machine scope

Rate-limit state lives in `~/.subrouter/state.json`, shared by every process and harness on the machine, so a rate-limited subscription is not retried per-session. Never shorten an existing cooldown. 429 honors `retry-after` (min 5 minutes); 402 (balance exhausted) cools down 6 hours.

## Harness plugins

- **opencode** (`@subrouter/opencode`): done. Users register it in the `plugin` array in `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`. It exports two plugins: `subrouterPlugin` (config hook, registers the provider) and `subrouterAuthPlugin` (auth hook, drives login).
- **pi** (`@subrouter/pi`): registers logical preset models through the current `@earendil-works/pi-*` APIs. It forwards native Pi stream events unchanged. It retries another candidate only before output starts and never reads Pi's auth store.
- **kimaki**: registers `@subrouter/opencode` next to its own legacy rotation plugins and lists `subrouter` first in Discord `/login`. Its legacy anthropic/openai/xai plugins are marked LEGACY but not deleted, because opencode ships no Claude Pro/Max auth of its own and plain `anthropic/*` model ids would break.

## Login is split into begin/complete

Adapters expose `beginLogin()` returning a `LoginSession`, not a blocking `login()`. Harnesses that cannot sit on a TTY (opencode's auth hook, and through it a Discord bot) need to show `url` + `instructions` immediately and finish later. `runLogin()` in `adapters/index.ts` is the blocking wrapper the CLI uses; never reintroduce a blocking `login` on the adapter interface.

Two contracts to protect:

- **`instructions` is parsed, not just displayed.** Device flows must embed the code as `code: XXXX-XXXX` (uppercase alphanumeric plus dashes). Harnesses regex it out to render the code on its own line. `cli/src/adapters/login.test.ts` asserts this with the same regex kimaki uses.
- **`complete()` is memoized.** Harnesses retry the callback. A second call must return the in-flight promise, not start a second device poll or a second token exchange.

`cancel()` releases anything the session holds, which for anthropic is a listening callback server on port 53692. Call it on any abandoned flow.

## AI SDK version pinning

`@ai-sdk/*` and `@ai-sdk/provider` versions are pinned to match what opencode bundles (provider spec `LanguageModelV3`). When bumping, check opencode's `packages/opencode/package.json` first; a spec mismatch breaks model loading inside opencode.

## Docs site

`website/` is a Holocron site. `website/src/index.mdx` imports the repo `README.md`, so **the README is the docs home page**. Editing the README changes subrouter.org.

Consequences to respect when editing `README.md`:

- **No MDX JSX components** in the README. GitHub renders them as raw text.
- ASCII diagrams must use the ` ```diagram ` fence so Holocron styles them.
- After editing any diagram or table, run the fixer. LLMs cannot count padding.

```bash
npx -y "@holocron.so/cli" diagrams fix README.md
```

Build before deploying; the build reports broken links and MDX errors.

```bash
cd website
pnpm build
pnpm deploy:prod
```

The site is served from two Cloudflare custom domains, `subrouter.org` and `www.subrouter.org`, configured in `website/wrangler.jsonc`.

**Deploy after changing the README.** The site does not rebuild on its own, so an uncorrected README stays live until someone runs `pnpm deploy:prod`.

**Deploy after every npm publish too.** A package release is not complete until the current docs are live on subrouter.org.

## Testing rules

- **No real API calls in tests.** Fake provider endpoints with local HTTP servers; every adapter has a matching `SUBROUTER_<PROVIDER>_BASE_URL` override.
- `cli/src/router.test.ts` covers rotation order, cooldown recording, non-rotate errors passing through, exhaustion errors.
- `opencode/src/opencode-e2e.test.ts` boots a real `opencode serve` (devDep `opencode-ai`) with fake endpoints and asserts a 429 provider is cycled to the fallback through the whole pipeline. It loads `opencode/dist/provider.js`, so run `pnpm build` before tests.
- `pi/src/pi-e2e.test.ts` loads `pi/dist/index.js` through Pi's real `ResourceLoader`, uses in-memory Pi stores and local HTTP endpoints, and covers account rotation, cross-provider fallback, non-rotate errors, and partial-stream safety.
- Tests use temp `SUBROUTER_HOME` dirs; never touch the real `~/.subrouter`.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build      # required before opencode e2e
pnpm test
```

## Conventions

- errore error handling everywhere (`errore.createTaggedError`, errors as values, `instanceof Error` early returns).
- goke for the CLI (vendored `colors`, `isAgent` guards, clack prompts only in TTY, `.completions()` registered).
- TypeScript per the npm-package template: `rootDir: src`, `.ts` import extensions with `rewriteRelativeImportExtensions`, `type: module`, exports map with `./src` source exports.
- Run `lintcn lint` inside each edited package before finishing a session.

## Real-world validation notes (2026-02)

Verified with a real Claude Pro/Max + ChatGPT login (browser flows driven end to end):

- anthropic PKCE login can hit an **hCaptcha** on the authorize click; the flow still completes after solving it. Identity endpoint returns the email.
- openai Codex device-code flow works as ported from opencode.
- A real cross-provider failover was observed: Codex returned "The usage limit has been reached" → account cooled down → the same request completed on anthropic. The classifier matches that message via the "usage limit" text check.
