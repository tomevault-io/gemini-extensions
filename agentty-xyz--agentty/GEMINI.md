# Agentty

TUI tool to manage agents.

# MANDATORY

> **STOP! Read this section before proceeding.**
> These rules are absolute and take precedence over all others.

- **Document Code:** Document all added or updated code using docstrings. When touching existing code, add or refresh docstrings so the changed behavior is clearly described.
- **Update AGENTS.md:** Update the relevant `AGENTS.md` file only when a user instruction establishes a critical, persistent preference, convention, or workflow rule. Do not update it for one-off tasks.
- **Semantic Guidance Only:** Keep `AGENTS.md` files focused on purpose, entry points, invariants, change routing, and docs-sync notes. Do not maintain exhaustive per-directory file inventories.
- **Local Paths Only:** In `AGENTS.md`, do not use parent-directory relative paths. Each file should describe only its own directory or module boundary.
- **Context First:** Before broad exploration, read the nearest available `AGENTS.md`. If the current directory does not have one, fall back to the closest ancestor guide and the architecture docs in `docs/site/content/docs/architecture/`.
- **Context7 First:** If Context7 is connected as an MCP server, use it to retrieve the latest documentation and API details for the tools and libraries used in the task.
- **Test Isolation for External Commands:** Keep isolated single-command tests real when they validate one external command call, but for higher-level flows that involve multiple external command calls, always extract trait boundaries and mock them with `mockall` (`#[cfg_attr(test, mockall::automock)]`) to reduce runtime and flakiness.

## Project Facts

- Project is a Rust workspace.
- The `crates/` directory contains all workspace members.
- All workspace crates use the `ag-` prefix (e.g., `ag-xtask`).
- `agentty`: A binary crate providing the CLI interface using Ratatui.
- **Workflow**: Agents are run in isolated git worktrees.
- **Review**: Users review changes using the Diff view (`d` key in chat) which shows the output of `git diff` in the session's worktree.
- **Output**: Agent `stdout` and `stderr` are captured in parallel using `tokio` tasks to ensure prompts and errors are visible.

## Product-vs-Repository Prompt Scope

Agentty is developed with Agentty, so prompts often describe developer workflows
that should become Agentty product behavior rather than instructions to operate on
this repository's current session.

- Treat workflow prompts about branches, worktrees, commits, reviews, sessions,
  agent prompts, or agent behavior as requirements for Agentty's user-facing
  functionality by default.
- Apply those prompts to the projects that Agentty manages for its users, not to
  the local Agentty development checkout, unless the user explicitly names this
  repository, this worktree, or the current branch/session.
- If a prompt could require a mutating action against the local repository, first
  reinterpret it as a product requirement. Ask for clarification only when the
  requested scope still remains ambiguous after that reinterpretation.
- Example: `make sure main branch is always up-to-date` means Agentty should
  provide behavior that keeps users' project `main` branches current for managed
  workflows; it does not mean this repository's local `main` branch should be
  updated.

## Rust Project Style Guide

- **Dependency Management:** ALL dependencies (including `dev-dependencies` and `build-dependencies`) must be defined in the root `Cargo.toml` under `[workspace.dependencies]`.
- All workspace crates must use `workspace = true` for shared package metadata and dependencies. Never define a version number inside a crate's `Cargo.toml`.
- **Release Profile:** Maintain optimized release settings in `Cargo.toml` (`codegen-units=1`, `lto=true`, `opt-level="s"`, `strip=true`) to minimize binary size.
- Use `ratatui` for terminal UI development.
- **Constructors:** Only add `new()` and `Default` when there is actual initialization logic or fields with meaningful defaults. For unit structs or zero-field structs, construct directly (e.g., `MyStruct`) — do not add boilerplate `new()` / `Default` impls.
- **Constructors:** Prefer `Type::new(...)` associated constructors over standalone helper functions when constructing that type.
- **Function Ordering:** Order functions to allow reading from top to bottom (caller before callee):
  - Public functions first.
  - Followed by less public functions (e.g., `pub(crate)`).
  - Private functions last.
  - If a function has multiple callees, they should appear in the order they are first called within that function.
- **File Naming:** Use **singular** names for Rust source files (e.g., `model.rs`, `icon.rs`, `agent.rs`). Do not use plural forms.
- **Module Layout:** Prefer `module.rs` paired with `module/` for modules that have child modules. Do not introduce new `mod.rs` files.
- **Parent Module Router Rule:** For every `module.rs` file paired with a `module/` directory, keep `module.rs` router-only. It may declare child modules and re-export child APIs, but must not define runtime logic, functions, structs, enums, traits, impl blocks, or constants.
- **Imports:** Always place imports at the top of the file. Do not use local `use` statements within functions or other blocks.
  - For internal crate paths, prefer module-oriented imports and namespace usage by default (for example, `use crate::infra::agent;` and `agent::create_backend(...)`).
  - Use direct item imports only when they materially improve readability (for example, frequently used traits/types like `AppMode`, `PathBuf`, `Arc`, or small focused groups in braces).
  - Do not mix styles for the same module in one file. If a module is imported, use that module alias/path consistently instead of also using fully-qualified `crate::...` paths.
  - Use fully-qualified `crate::...` references only when needed for disambiguation, explicit UFCS trait calls, or rustdoc links.
  - In test modules, prefer `use super::*;` where practical.
- **Test-only code placement:** Never introduce `#[cfg(test)]` in production code outside `#[cfg(test)] mod tests`. Keep test-only helpers, imports, and support code inside test modules instead (duplicate code there if needed). The only exception is `#[cfg_attr(test, mockall::automock)]` on traits used for mocking.
- **Struct Fields:** Order fields in structs as follows:
  - Public fields first.
  - Private fields second.
  - Within each group, sort fields alphabetically.
- **Clippy Compliance:** Do not bypass clippy rules with `#[allow()]`. Adopt the solution that complies with the rule.
- **Code Grouping:** Within functions, separate related code blocks with empty lines. Group lines that belong together logically and add blank lines between distinct groups.
- **Return Spacing:** Always add an empty line before return statements, both explicit (`return`) and implicit (last expression). Exception: single-line blocks where the return is the only statement.
- **Impl Placement:** Place each standalone/inherent `impl StructName { ... }` block immediately below its `struct` declaration, then place trait impls (e.g., `impl Trait for StructName`) after it.
- **Helper Placement:** Place helper functions used by only one struct inside that struct’s `impl`; keep only shared helpers at file scope.
- **Testability via DI:** Prefer trait-based dependency injection for external boundaries (terminal events, git/process calls, clocks/timers, filesystem, network) so logic can be tested deterministically.
  - Keep runtime wiring in production implementations and inject trait objects/generics into orchestration functions.
  - Use `#[cfg_attr(test, mockall::automock)]` on internal traits where mocking is needed.
  - Prefer testing behavior through injected fakes/mocks over end-to-end terminal/process dependencies when unit coverage is the goal.

## Database Standards (SQLx + SQLite)

### 1. Stack & Pattern

- **Driver:** `sqlx` (Feature: `sqlite`).
- **Runtime:** `tokio`.
- **Pattern:** Repository pattern or direct service-layer queries. **No ORM**.
- **Safety:** Prefer compile-time checked macros (`query!`, `query_as!`).
  - *Requirement:* `.sqlx` directory must be committed for offline compilation (CI/CD).
- **Concurrency:** Must enable **WAL Mode** (Write-Ahead Logging) for concurrent readers/writers.

### 2. Naming Conventions (Strict)

- **Tables:** `snake_case`, **SINGULAR** (e.g., `user`, `order_item`).
  - *Rationale:* Matches Rust struct names exactly (`User` -> `user`).
- **Columns:** `snake_case`.
  - **PK:** `id` (`INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT`).
  - **FK:** `{table}_id` (e.g., `user_id`).
  - **Booleans:** Prefix with `is_`, `has_` (Stored as `INTEGER`, mapped to `bool`).
  - **Timestamps:** `{action}_at` (Stored as `INTEGER` (Unix) or `TEXT` (ISO8601)).
- **Rust Structs:**
  - Name: Singular, PascalCase (e.g., `User`).
  - Fields: `snake_case` (Matches DB columns 1:1).

### 3. Implementation Guidelines

1. **Configuration:**
   - Set `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON;` (SQLite defaults to OFF).
   - Set `PRAGMA journal_mode = WAL;` (Crucial for performance).
1. **Migrations:** Embedded at compile time via `sqlx::migrate!()`.
   - Place SQL files in `crates/<crate>/migrations/` named `NNN_description.sql`.
   - Migrations run automatically on database open; no external CLI required.
   - Never modify existing migration files. Always add a new migration file for every schema change.
   - If `SQLite` cannot alter a structure in place (for example, changing a primary key), use a new migration that drops and recreates the table.
1. **Dependency Injection:** Pass `&sqlx::SqlitePool` to functions.
   - *Note:* SQLite handles cloning the pool cheaply.
1. **Error Handling:** Map `sqlx::Error` to domain-specific errors.

## Async Runtime (Tokio)

The project uses `tokio` as its async runtime. The binary entry point uses `#[tokio::main]` and all I/O-bound operations are async.

### Feature Selection

- **NEVER** use `features = ["full"]`. The project optimizes for binary size — only enable the specific features you need.
- When adding a new tokio API, check which feature flag it requires and add only that flag.

### Mutex Selection: `std::sync::Mutex` vs `tokio::sync::Mutex`

- **Default to `std::sync::Mutex`** unless you need to hold the lock across an `.await` point.
- `tokio::sync::Mutex` is only needed when the critical section itself contains `.await` calls (e.g., async file I/O, async network calls).
- If the critical section is purely synchronous (e.g., `writeln!` to a `std::fs::File`, pushing to a `String`), use `std::sync::Mutex` even inside async functions. It is cheaper and avoids unnecessary async overhead.
- **Wrong:** `Arc<tokio::sync::Mutex<std::fs::File>>` with `file.lock().await` followed by sync `writeln!`.
- **Right:** `Arc<std::sync::Mutex<std::fs::File>>` with `file.lock().ok()` followed by sync `writeln!`.

### Blocking Operations

- Use `tokio::task::spawn_blocking` for operations that block the thread (e.g., shelling out to `git` via `std::process::Command`).
- Do **not** call blocking functions directly in async contexts — it starves the tokio worker threads.
- For subprocess management where you need async streaming of stdout/stderr, use `tokio::process::Command` instead.

### Variable Cloning for `move` Closures

- When cloning variables for `spawn_blocking` or `tokio::spawn` closures, prefer **variable shadowing** or **scoped blocks** over `_clone` suffixes.
- **Wrong:** `let folder_clone = folder.clone(); let root_clone = root.clone();`
- **Right (shadowing):** `let folder = folder.clone();`
- **Right (scoped block):** Wrap the `spawn_blocking` call in a block so the originals remain available after:
  ```rust
  {
      let source = source_branch.clone();
      tokio::task::spawn_blocking(move || do_work(&source)).await??;
  }
  // source_branch is still usable here
  ```

### Tests

- Use `#[tokio::test]` for async test functions, not `#[test]`.
- All `sqlx` operations are async and require `.await`.
- For sleep/delays in tests, use `tokio::time::sleep` instead of `std::thread::sleep`.
- Prefer tests to follow the same order as the functions they cover when practical.

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **No sync wrappers:** Do not wrap async code in `Runtime::new()` + `block_on()`. The codebase is fully async — keep it that way.
- **No `features = ["full"]`:** Always specify individual tokio features.
- **No `tokio::sync::Mutex` for sync-only guards:** Only use it when the critical section contains `.await`.

### UI Render Hot Paths

- In per-frame UI paths (`App::draw()`, `ui::render()`, and page/component `render()` helpers), avoid cloning large `String`, `Vec`, or `HashMap` values just to satisfy borrow scopes. Prefer borrow splitting, small frame snapshots, or other designs that keep render inputs shared.
- When adding cached derived UI data (markdown lines, diff layout, lookup maps, wrapped text), keep the cache bounded and document the cache key plus invalidation trigger in code comments or docstrings.
- If a layout/count helper and the final paint path need the same expensive derived data, route both through the same cache or shared snapshot instead of recomputing the full render twice per frame.

## Quality Gates

Use a tiered validation flow so local iteration stays fast without lowering the
final quality bar.

### Inner Loop

Use these while iterating on a change:

1. **Autofix:** `prek run rustfmt-fix --all-files --hook-stage manual`
1. **Compile:** `prek run cargo-check --all-files`
1. **Focused Tests:** Run the narrowest matching hook from the `prek` hook catalog when one exists (for example `prek run test-agentty-e2e --all-files --hook-stage manual`).

### Final Local Validation

`prek` runs the repository hook catalog from `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, which is
the executable source of truth for validation commands. Keep agent workflows
and CI invoking hook IDs from that file instead of re-encoding cargo or Zola
commands elsewhere.

Run this sequence before handoff, commit, or opening a review:

1. **Autofix:** `prek run rustfmt-fix --all-files --hook-stage manual && prek run clippy-fix --all-files --hook-stage manual`
1. **Validate:** `prek run --all-files`
1. **Lint:** `prek run clippy --all-files --hook-stage manual`
1. **Test:** `prek run test-workspace --all-files --hook-stage manual`

Focused tests are allowed during development, but they do not replace the final
full-suite run.

### Periodic / CI

Use these slower hygiene checks in CI or when making broader changes:

1. **Coverage Summary:** `prek run coverage --all-files --hook-stage manual`
1. **Coverage Upload:** `prek run coverage-lcov --all-files --hook-stage manual`
1. **Docs Site:** `prek run zola-check --all-files --hook-stage manual`
1. **Dependency Hygiene:** `prek run cargo-shear --all-files --hook-stage manual`

The manual-stage autofix hooks apply formatting and fixable clippy lints. The
default validation command keeps feedback relatively fast, while the explicit
manual-stage hooks keep slower lint, test, docs, and coverage checks available
through the same hook catalog.

### Test Failure Protocol

- **Stuck tests:** If a test produces no output for 5 minutes, kill it and report the test name and last output to the user immediately.
- **Failing tests:** Attempt to fix the failing test up to 3 times. After 3 failed attempts, stop and report the test name, error output, and what was tried to the user.
- **Do not skip or ignore:** Never mark a failing test as `#[ignore]`, delete it, or bypass it to unblock progress.

### Manual Verification

- **Test Style:** Verify *every* test function uses explicit `// Arrange`, `// Act`, and `// Assert` comments.
  - Combining `Arrange`, `Act`, and `Assert` is allowed when it improves clarity (for very small tests).
- **Dependencies:** Verify all dependencies (including dev/build) are defined in the root `Cargo.toml` and referenced via `workspace = true`.
- **Boundary Governance:** In `app/` and `runtime/` orchestration code, reject direct `Command::new`, `Instant::now`, `SystemTime::now`, and direct filesystem/process calls unless they are routed behind an explicit trait boundary.
  - Treat directory walking, `Path::exists`, `Path::is_dir`, `Path::is_file`, `std::fs`, `tokio::fs`, and path canonicalization or copy helpers as filesystem boundary calls too; keep them in `infra/` and inject traits into orchestration layers.

## Documentation Conventions

- **Code Element Formatting:** Always wrap code elements in backticks (\`) when referencing them in documentation, commit messages, PR descriptions, or bullet points:
  - Enum variants: `Sessions`, `Roadmap`
  - Struct/Type names: `RoadmapPage`, `Tab`, `AppMode`
  - Function names: `next_tab()`, `render()`
  - Field names: `current_tab`, `table_state`
  - Key bindings: `Tab`, `Enter`, `Esc`
  - File names: `model.rs`, `AGENTS.md`
  - Configuration values: `workspace = true`
- This improves readability and clearly distinguishes code from prose.
- **Rust Docs:** Add `///` doc comments to structs and all public functions/types in touched Rust files.
- **Contextual Docs:** When touching a file for code changes and updating docs, also add or refresh missing/stale doc comments for related sibling and parent elements (for example `struct`, `enum`, `impl`, and closely related items) when needed for clarity.

## Documentation Sync

When adding, removing, or changing user-facing features (agent backends, models, keybindings, session states, UI pages), update the corresponding documentation page in `docs/site/content/docs/`. Source-side `AGENTS.md` files indicate which doc pages track their area.

| Doc Page | Covers |
|----------|--------|
| `docs/site/content/docs/agents/backends.md` | Agent backends and models. |
| `docs/site/content/docs/usage/workflow.md` | Session lifecycle, workflow, slash commands, and data location. |
| `docs/site/content/docs/usage/keybindings.md` | Keybindings across lists, session view, diff mode, and prompt input. |
| `docs/site/content/docs/getting-started/overview.md` | High-level concepts and worktree isolation. |
| `docs/site/content/docs/architecture/runtime-flow.md` | Architecture goals, workspace map, runtime flow, and channel transport model. |
| `docs/site/content/docs/architecture/module-map.md` | Module boundaries and path ownership across layers. |
| `docs/site/content/docs/architecture/change-recipes.md` | Change-path recipes and architecture-safe contributor checklist. |
| `docs/site/content/docs/architecture/testability-boundaries.md` | Trait boundaries and testability guidance for external integrations. |
| `docs/site/content/docs/contributing/managing-docs-with-zola.md` | Conventions for maintaining docs with Zola. |

Update architecture docs whenever you change:

- Module boundaries (`app`, `domain`, `infra`, `runtime`, `ui`) or add/remove/rename modules (`docs/site/content/docs/architecture/module-map.md`).
- Runtime or control flow between layers (event loop, mode dispatch, app orchestration) (`docs/site/content/docs/architecture/runtime-flow.md`).
- Trait-based external boundaries (`GitClient`, `AppServerClient`, `EventSource`) (`docs/site/content/docs/architecture/testability-boundaries.md`).
- Workspace crate ownership or add/remove workspace members (`docs/site/content/docs/architecture/module-map.md`).
- Canonical change-path guidance (`docs/site/content/docs/architecture/change-recipes.md`) when contribution workflows change.

### Docs Site Integrity

- Every feature page under `docs/site/content/features/` that declares
  `[extra].gif` must have the matching GIF committed under
  `docs/site/static/features/`; if GIF generation is skipped locally, do not
  add or keep the feature page yet.
- When keybindings or visible shortcut labels change, verify
  `docs/site/content/docs/usage/keybindings.md` and
  `docs/site/content/docs/usage/workflow.md` against the runtime mode handlers
  and `crates/agentty/src/ui/state/help_action.rs`.
- When forge review-request support changes, keep the docs phrasing aligned
  with all supported forge families and their CLIs, including GitHub/`gh` and
  GitLab/`glab`.

## Git Conventions

- For all commit preparation and commit message work, use `skills/git-commit/SKILL.md`.
- **Tagging:** Always use the `v` prefix for version tags (e.g., `v0.1.0`).
- **Never bypass `prek`-managed hooks:** Do not use `--no-verify`, `--no-gpg-sign`, or any other flag that skips or disables git hooks managed by `prek`. If a hook fails, investigate and fix the underlying issue instead of bypassing it.

## Release Automation

- Treat `.github/workflows/release.yml` as generated output from `dist`. Do not edit this workflow file manually.
- To upgrade `cargo-dist`, update `cargo-dist-version` in `dist-workspace.toml`, then rerun `dist init` from the repository root so `dist` regenerates `.github/workflows/release.yml` and any related release automation changes.
- When updating `cargo-dist`, review and commit the generated changes in `dist-workspace.toml` and `.github/workflows/release.yml` together.

## Git Worktree Integration

Agentty automatically creates isolated git worktrees for sessions when launched from within a git repository:

- **Automatic Behavior:** When `agentty` is launched from a git repository, each new session automatically gets its own git worktree with a dedicated branch.
- **Branch Naming:** Worktree branches follow the pattern `wt/<hash>`, where `<hash>` is the first 8 characters of the session UUID (e.g., `wt/a1b2c3d4`).
- **Base Branch:** The worktree is based on the branch that was active when `agentty` was launched.
- **Location:** Worktrees are created in the session folder (under `~/.agentty/wt/<hash>/` by default, or the location specified by `AGENTTY_ROOT`), separate from the main repository.
- **Session Creation:** If worktree creation fails (e.g., git not installed, permission errors), session creation fails atomically and displays an error message.
- **Cleanup:** When a session is deleted, its worktree is automatically removed using `git worktree remove --force` and the corresponding branch is deleted.
- **Non-Git Directories:** Sessions in non-git directories work normally without worktrees.

## Agent Instructions

- **Pragmatic Abstractions:** Introduce new abstractions only when they provide clear payoff (reuse, reduced complexity, or materially better testability). For straightforward changes, prefer direct in-place edits with minimal diff.
- **No Pass-Through Wrappers:** Do not introduce functions whose body only forwards to another function call. Inline the call instead unless the wrapper adds real behavior, a meaningful boundary, or clear naming value that justifies the extra indirection.
- **Test Coverage:** Try to maintain 100% test coverage when it makes sense. Ensure critical logic is always covered, but pragmatic exceptions are allowed for boilerplate or untestable I/O.
- **Feature Test Gate:** Every user-visible feature (new UI page, keybinding, overlay, session state, prompt mode, or visual behavior change) must ship with a corresponding E2E feature test in `crates/agentty/tests/e2e/` using the `FeatureTest` builder from `common.rs`. Internal refactoring, protocol changes, and non-visual behavior do not require feature tests. Use the `FeatureTest` builder exclusively for new tests — do not use the legacy `save_feature_gif` pattern. When a feature test is blocked on missing infrastructure (e.g., mock agent channel for stateful session flows), queue a feature test card in `docs/plan/roadmap.md` instead of skipping coverage. Features that landed before this gate was established are tracked as backlog quality cards in the roadmap and do not block new work.
- **Readability:** Use descriptive variable names. Do NOT use single-letter variables (e.g., `f`, `p`, `c`) or single-letter prefixes. Code should be self-documenting.
- **Legacy Retention Approval:** Prefer removing legacy code/behavior during development. If retaining legacy code/behavior for any reason, obtain explicit user approval first.
- **Diff-First Verification:** In every non-`main` branch, when a user asks for something that is not currently present on `main`, always inspect the full worktree diff against the branch base/fork point (typically `main`) before concluding what changed or what still needs to be implemented. This check must include committed and uncommitted changes, include untracked files, and avoid counting commits already applied to the base branch (for example via squash merge or cherry-pick).
- Always cover all touched code with auto tests to prevent regressions and ensure stability.
- When removing behavior, do not add tests or assertions that only verify the removed shortcut, label, or action is absent. Prefer tests that cover the remaining supported behavior.
- Structure tests using "Arrange, Act, Assert" comments to clearly separate setup, execution, and verification phases.
- When creating a new `AGENTS.md` file in any directory, always create corresponding symlinks: `ln -s AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md && ln -s AGENTS.md GEMINI.md` in the same directory.
- Keep the root `README.md` up to date whenever new information is relevant to end users (e.g., new crates, features, usage instructions, or prerequisites).
- **Changelog:** Update `CHANGELOG.md` when releasing a new version. Follow the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) format.

## Skills

- Skills are available under `skills/`, with the summary catalog in `skills/AGENTS.md`.
- Read `skills/AGENTS.md` to discover available skills before selecting one.
- Activate a skill when the user explicitly names it or the task intent matches the skill description.
- Use the minimal set of skills needed for the current turn.
- Do not carry a skill across turns unless it is explicitly requested again or clearly re-triggered by intent.

## Meta-Agent Inventory

The project uses two layers of prompt-driven meta-agents that shape agent behavior:

### Interactive Skills (`skills/`)

User- or AI-triggered workflow guides invoked via slash commands. Pure markdown with numbered steps.

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [`git-commit`](skills/git-commit/SKILL.md) | Gather context, write commit messages following repo conventions. |
| [`review`](skills/review/SKILL.md) | Structured code review with severity-categorized report output. |
| [`implementation-plan`](skills/implementation-plan/SKILL.md) | Create iterative execution plans in `docs/plan/` with size budgeting. |
| [`release`](skills/release/SKILL.md) | Version bump, changelog, tagging, and push workflow. |
| [`feature-test`](skills/feature-test/SKILL.md) | Create E2E feature tests with VHS GIF generation and Zola page auto-discovery. |

### Analysis Skills (`skills/`)

Agent-driven analysis skills that review a codebase and return findings as prioritized markdown task lists in the `answer` field. Discovered organically via `AGENTS.md`.

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [`security-audit`](skills/security-audit/SKILL.md) | Audit subprocess execution, path handling, SQL queries, panic conditions, and dependency risks. |
| [`tech-debt`](skills/tech-debt/SKILL.md) | Sweep for TODOs, stale patterns, missing docs, and dead code. |

### Runtime Prompt Templates (`crates/agentty/src/infra/agent/template/`)

Askama templates compiled into the binary that are sent to agent backends automatically during session workflows.

| Template | Rust Struct | Trigger | Job |
|----------|-------------|---------|-----|
| `session_title_generation_prompt.md` | `SessionTitleGenerationPromptTemplate` | New session | Generate a concise session title from the user's first prompt. |
| `session_commit_message_prompt.md` | `SessionCommitMessagePromptTemplate` | Auto-commit | Generate or refine commit messages from the cumulative session diff. |
| `review_assist_prompt.md` | `ReviewAssistPromptTemplate` | Diff view (`d` key) | Read-only code review producing `## Review` → `### Project Impact` → `### Suggestions`. |
| `auto_commit_assist_prompt.md` | `AutoCommitAssistPromptTemplate` | Commit failure | Fix code so a follow-up commit can succeed (no git commands allowed). |
| `rebase_assist_prompt.md` | `RebaseAssistPromptTemplate` | Rebase conflict | Resolve conflict markers using read-only git analysis. |
| `protocol_instruction_prompt.md` | `ProtocolInstructionPromptTemplate` | Every agent turn | Wrap prompts with structured JSON response protocol and file-path rules. |
| `resume_with_session_output_prompt.md` | `ResumeWithSessionOutputPromptTemplate` | Model switch | Replay prior session transcript for context continuity. |
