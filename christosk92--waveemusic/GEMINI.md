This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository at a glance

WaveeMusic is a clean-room Spotify desktop client for Windows: a .NET 10 reimplementation of Spotify's Access Point, Mercury, Connect (Dealer WebSocket), SpClient (protobuf/HTTPS), and Pathfinder (GraphQL) protocols, wrapped in a WinUI 3 app. Requires a Spotify Premium account.

Top-level project READMEs are the canonical source of architectural detail — they're already detailed and current. Read them before invasive changes:

- `README.md` — features, project layout, gabo events surface, what's excluded from public source.
- `src/Wavee/README.md` — core protocol library entry points (`Session`, `DealerClient`, `PlaybackOrchestrator`, `SpClient`, `PathfinderClient`, `AudioKeyManager`).
- `src/Wavee.UI/README.md` — framework-neutral UI service layer.
- `src/Wavee.UI.WinUI/README.md` — desktop app composition, services, custom MSBuild targets, on-device AI plumbing.
- `src/Wavee.AudioHost/README.md` — out-of-process audio runtime (x64-only).
- `src/Wavee.Playback.Contracts/README.md` — IPC wire format.
- `src/Wavee.Console/README.md` — AOT CLI client (Linux/Docker friendly).
- `src/Wavee.Controls.Lyrics/README.md` — lyrics rendering control library.
- `src/Wavee/Connect/DEALER_PROTOCOL.md` and `DEALER_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` — wire-level Dealer reference.
- `src/Wavee/OAuth/OAUTH_FLOWS.md` — Spotify OAuth analysis.

## High-level architecture

### Process model

The desktop app runs as **two processes** that talk over a named pipe:

```
Wavee.UI.WinUI  (any arch)  ◄── named pipe ──►  Wavee.AudioHost  (x64-only)
```

`Wavee.UI.WinUI`'s `BuildAudioHost` MSBuild target spawns an **isolated** `dotnet build` subprocess for `Wavee.AudioHost` on every WinUI build (with `Platform=x64` forced). This is deliberate, not a quirk: an in-process MSBuild reference would inherit the parent build's project-evaluation cache and could land an ARM64 NVorbis.dll next to AudioHost's x64 exe. The fresh subprocess prevents that whole class of bug. Cost: a few seconds per launch.

AudioHost is x64-only because it `LoadLibrary`s `Spotify.dll` (x86_64-native) for PlayPlay key derivation. On ARM64 Windows it runs under built-in x64 emulation. The WinUI process can be any arch.

### Why a separate audio process

1. Audio engine crashes don't take the UI down; UI can respawn the host.
2. Audio doesn't pay for the WinUI process's reflection-heavy MVVM heap; UI doesn't pay for native audio buffers.
3. Per-process arch isolation (see above).

### IPC contract

Length-prefixed JSON over named pipe: `[4 bytes big-endian length][UTF-8 JSON payload]`. Each `IpcMessage` carries `type` (kebab-case discriminator), `id` (request correlation), and `payload` (free-form `JsonElement`).

`Wavee.Playback.Contracts` is consumed two different ways on purpose:
- **Project reference** by `Wavee` and (transitively) `Wavee.UI.WinUI`.
- **Source-included** by `Wavee.AudioHost` (`<Compile Include="..\Wavee.Playback.Contracts\IpcMessages.cs">`). AudioHost has **zero project references on Wavee\* assemblies** so a stale `Wavee.Playback.Contracts.dll` can never land alongside `Wavee.AudioHost.exe` and break startup. JSON wire format means type identity across assemblies doesn't matter.

When adding a new IPC command/event: edit `src/Wavee.Playback.Contracts/IpcMessages.cs` only. Both sides pick it up automatically.

### Project layering

```
Wavee.UI.WinUI  ──►  Wavee.UI            (framework-neutral, plain C# — testable without WinUI)
                ──►  Wavee                (core protocol library, no UI)
                ──►  Wavee.Playback.Contracts
                ──►  Wavee.Controls.Lyrics
                ──►  Lyricify.Lyrics.Helper (vendored)

Wavee  ──►  Wavee.Playback.Contracts
       ──►  NVorbis (vendored Ogg decoder)

Wavee.AudioHost  ──►  NVorbis only (no Wavee* refs — see IPC section)
```

`Wavee.UI` exists so anything that doesn't strictly need WinUI can be tested directly via `Wavee.UI.Tests` without booting the UI framework. Both `Wavee.UI` and `Wavee.UI.WinUI` get `InternalsVisibleTo` from `Wavee.UI`.

### Core library entry point — `Session`

`src/Wavee/Core/Session/Session.cs` is the anchor of everything: AP TCP+TLS connect, authenticate, then **lazy-init** of every subsystem (Dealer, Mercury, Pathfinder, AudioKeyManager, EventService) on first access. A consumer that only needs metadata (`pathfinder.SearchAsync(...)`) never opens a Dealer WebSocket or audio key channel. Use `ISession` in DI; the WinUI app registers a singleton wired with `SessionConfig`, `IHttpClientFactory`, `ILogger<Session>`, and an optional `IRemoteStateRecorder` (off by default; toggled from the Debug page).

Most state across the protocol layer is exposed as `IObservable<T>` — `System.Reactive` is used heavily.

### WinUI app composition

`App.OnLaunched` → `AppLifecycleHelper.ConfigureHost()` builds an `IHost` (Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting) → `Ioc.Default.ConfigureServices(...)` wires CommunityToolkit MVVM `Ioc` to the same container → force-resolve `IMetadataDatabase` to run schema migrations before first paint → start `CacheCleanupService` → activate `MainWindow` → `InitializeApplicationAsync` runs deferred init (login state, library sync). Crash handlers are wired at three levels (XAML, AppDomain, unobserved-task scheduler) and funnel through `LogUnhandledException` → `PiiRedactor` → `AppPaths.CrashLogPath`.

### Spotify Connect / Dealer

`src/Wavee/Connect/` implements the full Dealer WebSocket protocol (cluster state, transfer, volume, remote commands). `DealerClient` exposes `IObservable<DealerMessage>` and `Requests`. `DeviceStateManager` announces this device and handles `PutState`. `PlaybackStateManager` is the reactive view of remote cluster state. `ConnectCommandClient` issues commands with ack tracking. The desktop client works as both controller and target.

### Telemetry (gabo events)

Wavee posts the bare minimum playback events Spotify needs to credit Recently Played and play counts. All events go to `https://spclient.wg.spotify.com/gabo-receiver-service/v3/events/`. The legacy `event-service/v1/events` path returns 404 — gabo is the only working transport.

The `GaboEnvelopeFactory` mimics the C++ desktop client's context block (SDK strings, app version `1.2.88.483`, real BIOS manufacturer/model + Windows machine SID) to clear Spotify's anti-fraud pipeline. Anti-fraud silently drops batches whose context block doesn't look first-party. **If you change SDK strings, version code, or the device-context fragments, expect Recently Played to silently stop working.** The breakthrough is documented inline in `src/Wavee/Connect/Events/GaboEnvelopeFactory.cs`.

### AOT / trimming

`Wavee` and `Wavee.Console` are **strict AOT-compatible**: every IL2xxx/IL3xxx warning is escalated to an error. Adding reflection-based code will fail the build until it's annotated or refactored. Public types in `Wavee` are kept (no runtime reflection codegen). Protobuf-generated code is `Access="Public"` and excluded from default `Compile` to avoid duplication.

`Wavee.UI.WinUI` is **not** AOT/trim — it's framework-dependent, and re-enabling either would need `<SelfContained>true</>` (~70-100 MB AppX bloat) plus trim-validation across WinUI/ReactiveUI/MVVM Toolkit/ComputeSharp.

## What's excluded from the public source tree (proprietary)

Three Spotify-property files are gitignored. The build still compiles via stub fallbacks; specific features degrade.

| File | Effect when missing |
|---|---|
| `src/Wavee/Core/Crypto/AudioDecryptStream.cs` | No stub — file simply absent. Cannot decrypt encrypted Spotify Ogg streams in this repo's open form. Test fixtures in `test/Wavee.Tests/Core/Crypto/` document what *would* be tested. |
| `src/Wavee/Core/Audio/PlayPlayConstants.cs` | `PlayPlayConstants.Stub.cs` is used (csproj swaps via `Condition="Exists(...)"`). PlayPlay key fallback disabled at runtime; `AudioKeyManager` falls back to AP-only key resolution. |
| `src/Wavee.AudioHost/PlayPlay/PlayPlayKeyEmulator.cs` | `PlayPlayKeyEmulator.Stub.cs` ships in its place. `Wavee.PlayPlay.Tests` runs against the stub and skips real test vectors. |
| `test/test/Wavee.PlayPlay.Tests/Program.cs` | `Program.Stub.cs` ships in its place; the harness builds and runs but doesn't exercise PlayPlay end-to-end. |

Everything else works without these: auth, session management, Spotify Connect (controller + target), all metadata APIs, UI, library sync, search, lyrics, music videos via PlayReady, Connect commands, telemetry.

## Custom MSBuild targets to be aware of

In `Wavee.UI.WinUI.csproj`:

- **`BuildAudioHost`** — see "Process model" above. Spawns an isolated `dotnet build` for `Wavee.AudioHost` with `Platform=x64`. Required.
- **`RemoveDuplicateReferencedProjectAssets`** — WinUI AppX packaging copies `<Content>` from referenced projects twice. This deletes specific orphan duplicates (~14.6 MB for `Wiki82.profile.xml` alone). **Do not** widen the deletion to the full `AppX\Wavee.Controls.Lyrics\` folder — it also contains compiled `.xbf` per-assembly XAML that WinUI resolves at runtime.
- **`StripUnusedWindowsAiPayload`** — currently a no-op; ships the full Windows AI payload (~42 MB) until safe-to-strip DLLs are empirically verified on a real Copilot+ PC.
- **`IncludeWindowsAiProjectionAssembliesInMsixPayload` / `CopyWindowsAiProjectionAssembliesToAppxLayout(AfterPri)` / `PreserveWindowsAiManifestMaxVersionTested`** — workaround a WinAppSDK 2.0.1 regression that doesn't deploy `Microsoft.Windows.AI.*.Projection.dll` into AppX, plus an MSIX tooling bug that rewrites manifest `MaxVersionTested` back to the installed Windows SDK version. **Delete these targets when WinAppSDK / MSIX tooling fixes both.**

## On-device AI (Phi Silica)

The desktop app uses Microsoft's NPU-tuned Phi Silica via `Microsoft.Windows.AI.Text.LanguageModel` for opt-in lyrics features (explain a line, summarize meaning). All inference is on-device.

- **Hardware-gated**: Copilot+ PC required. Hidden everywhere else; model never downloaded.
- **Opt-in by default**: master toggle in Settings → On-device AI is OFF. Until flipped, no AI affordance renders and no Phi Silica calls are made.
- **Region-gated**: not available in China; Settings shows "Not available in your region" and affordances stay hidden.
- **Limited Access Feature**: production builds need an LAF unlock token in `Package.appxmanifest`. Without it, `LanguageModel.CreateAsync()` throws — `AiCapabilities` swallows that and affordances stay hidden.
- **Single decision point**: `src/Wavee.UI.WinUI/Services/AiCapabilities.cs` composes hardware + region + opt-in. Every AI affordance binds against it.

## Testing

| Suite | What | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `Wavee.Tests` | Core protocol library (`Wavee`) | xUnit v3 + FluentAssertions + Moq. `AnyCPU;x64;ARM64`. `DynamicProxyGenAssembly2` has `InternalsVisibleTo` for Castle proxy mocks. |
| `Wavee.UI.Tests` | Framework-neutral UI service layer (`Wavee.UI`) | xUnit v3 + FluentAssertions + Moq. Doesn't reference WinUI deliberately — that would drag in MSIX/RID complexity. |
| `Wavee.PlayPlay.Tests` | PlayPlay key emulator | Plain `Exe` harness, **not** xUnit; exits non-zero on failure. x64-only because it loads `Spotify.dll`. |

Crypto primitives (`ShannonCipher`, `AudioDecryptStream`) are validated against librespot vectors — see `test/Wavee.Tests/Core/Crypto/README.md` for how to regenerate.

## Conventions worth knowing

- **`InternalsVisibleTo` is part of the contract.** `Wavee` exposes internals to `Wavee.Tests`; `Wavee.UI` exposes to `Wavee.UI.WinUI` and `Wavee.UI.Tests`; `Wavee.UI.WinUI` exposes to `Wavee.Tests`. Marking something `internal` here is intentional, not a leak.
- **`IRemoteStateRecorder`** is threaded through `Session`, `DealerClient`, `DeviceStateManager`, `PlaybackStateManager`, and HTTP clients. Pass `null` for "no recording"; pass a real implementation (the WinUI app's `RemoteStateRecorder`, capped at 500 entries) to capture every dealer message + HTTP call for the Debug page.
- **Workstation GC** is intentional in `Wavee.UI.WinUI` (`<ServerGarbageCollection>false</>`). Image-heavy navigation UI doesn't want server GC's per-core heaps and aggressive working set growth — and the audio pipeline is out-of-process so playback latency doesn't need protecting.
- **C# preview language version** in `Wavee.UI.WinUI` (required for CommunityToolkit.Mvvm 8.4.x on .NET 10).
- **Protobuf code generation** runs at build time (`Grpc.Tools` 2.80.0). Generated files land in `src/Wavee/Protocol/Generated/`, are excluded from default `Compile`, and the `Protobuf` ItemGroup re-includes them with `Access="Public"`.
