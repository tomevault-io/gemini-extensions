# hipEngine - Agent Guide

hipEngine is a ROCm-native inference engine built around a clean Python host and the proven gfx1100 kernel lineage from `nano-vllm-amd`. See [docs/PLAN.md](docs/PLAN.md) for architecture, phase roadmap, and LoC budgets.

This `AGENTS.md` (`CLAUDE.md` symlinked) is read every session. It covers only ground rules that apply to every review / coding / benchmarking task. Activity-specific playbooks live in `docs/`.

Instruction precedence: if this file conflicts with platform / system / developer instructions, follow those first.

## Summary

- **Source of truth:** [docs/PLAN.md](docs/PLAN.md). Update it when architecture or phase plans move.
- **Cross-session handoff:** `WORKLOG.md`. Append-only, chronological; log decisions, commands, measurements, and next actions as they happen.
- **Testing discipline:** math changes are guilty until proven correct. Follow RED/GREEN where practical, and use `docs/TESTING.md` for fixture/oracle/gate details.
- **Evidence policy:** every performance claim carries model + quant + workload shape + hardware + exact command + result + correctness gate. No exceptions (see `docs/PLAN.md` "Evidence Policy" and `docs/BENCHMARK.md`).
- **Benchmark rollup stays current.** Every retained benchmark updates `benchmarks/README.md` (`Last updated` plus table row), `benchmarks/CHANGELOG.md` (dated one-liner with old→new metric, % delta, reason, artifact/source), and a compact artifact under `benchmarks/results/`.
- **Correctness gate for any new/ported kernel:** KL ≤ 0.05 AND top-1 agreement ≥ 90% vs `kernels/cpu_reference/` on fixture inputs.
- **Default hardware:** AMD Radeon Pro W7900, gfx1100/RDNA3. Claims about other backends require the corresponding hardware or are marked explicitly unverified.
- **Kernel R&D lives in `~/amd-gpu-tuning/`**, not here. hipEngine ingests *stable* kernels via port; micro-tuning, `rocprofv3` iteration loops, and the device-code gotcha catalog stay in the parent workspace.
- **Kernel catalog must stay current.** Before any kernel port, check `docs/KERNELS.md` and run `scripts/check_lineage.py`; update the catalog/path map if parent kernels or dispatch changed.

## Architectural Invariants

Do not drift these casually. They define what hipEngine is.

- **Torch-free runtime.** `import torch` is **not** allowed in any module reached by `hipengine.LLM.generate()`. Torch lives behind the optional `hipengine[torch]` extra and appears only as a dlpack bridge at the user boundary. Adding `import torch` anywhere on the hot path is an architectural change, not a refactor.
- **Four-axis plugin registry.** Kernels are keyed by `(backend, layer, quant, variant)`. Models, quant schemes, and layers are plugins. **Never** add `if backend == "hip_gfx1100"` or `if quant == "..."` branches in dispatch / engine / model code; register against a registry key instead. See `docs/PLAN.md` "Extensibility Design" for mechanics.
- **Fused kernels require an unfused fallback.** Every fused composite (`rmsnorm+rotate`, `gate_combine_residual`, …) must have a numerically-equivalent unfused chain registered under its primitives.
- **Kernel bodies take raw device pointers.** `__global__` signatures use `void*` / typed pointers, never `torch::Tensor`. Only the host-side launch wrappers convert.
- **`KVLiveSpans` is the attention kernel ABI, not a DMS-only concept.** Every paged-KV-write and attention-decode kernel reads `(base_offsets, live_counts, token_positions, evict_mask)`. Dense policies fill it uniformly; DMS/H2O/SnapKV fill it variably. Do not shortcut to `(block_table, context_len)`.
- **Backend tree is a peer structure.** `kernels/hip_gfx1100/`, `kernels/hip_gfx1151/`, `kernels/cuda_sm86/`, `kernels/cpu_reference/` are siblings. There is no "AMD directory".

## Workflow

### Before Starting

1. `git status -sb` — note unrelated changes and leave them alone.
2. Read the relevant section of [docs/PLAN.md](docs/PLAN.md) and the `WORKLOG.md` tail.
3. For kernel / GPU work, confirm ROCm is alive:
   ```bash
   python3 -c "import ctypes; ctypes.CDLL('libamdhip64.so'); print('hip OK')"
   rocminfo | grep -E 'Name:|gfx'
   ```
4. Before any kernel port, read `docs/KERNELS.md` for the current catalog/path map and run `python3 scripts/check_lineage.py --kind kernel --diff stat` (or a narrower `--file` filter). Inspect DRIFT commits/diffs and parent WORKLOG/OPTIMAL evidence before copying code.
5. For a perf claim, define the baseline (model, quant, workload shape, hardware, command) from `docs/BENCHMARK.md` and `benchmarks/README.md` before making the change.

### During Work

- Keep changes scoped to one logical unit (one kernel family, one plugin, one doc, one phase milestone).
- Write or update the targeted test/fixture before implementation when behavior or math changes. If RED-first is impractical, record why in `WORKLOG.md`.
- Log non-trivial decisions, measurements, and dependency additions in `WORKLOG.md` as they happen.
- When profiling Python/ctypes JIT-built kernels with `rocprofv3`, prebuild the `.so` outside the profiler and run the profiled command with a precomputed compiler-version file plus `require_cached`; do not let the profiled process spawn `hipcc`/clang.
- Do not silently add `import torch`, `flash_attn`, or other CUDA-only deps to hot-path modules.
- Do not add `if backend == "..."` or `if quant == "..."` branches in engine / dispatch / model code.

### After Changes (before claiming done)

- Run the narrowest relevant test, then the applicable `docs/TESTING.md` gate before claiming done.
- For a new / ported kernel: correctness gate vs `kernels/cpu_reference/` + a `rocprofv3 --kernel-trace` entry showing the kernel ran under the expected name with plausible duration (`DurationNs` or `End_Timestamp - Start_Timestamp`). See `docs/KERNELS.md`.
- For a perf change: record baseline + new measurements in `WORKLOG.md` with exact commands, emit/update the JSON artifact under `benchmarks/results/`, update `benchmarks/README.md` with the retained row and `Last updated` date, and add a dated changelog one-liner with old→new metric, % delta, reason, and artifact/source.
- Update `docs/PLAN.md` if architectural plans shifted.
- **Commit immediately** when the logical unit is complete and validation passes.

### Verification tiers

Run the narrowest tier for your change; escalate at milestone boundaries.

| Scope | What to run |
| --- | --- |
| Docs / process | Re-read the changed file end-to-end; no GPU run needed. |
| Code / registry / dispatch | The narrowest relevant `pytest` + applicable CPU deterministic bundle (see `docs/TESTING.md`). |
| New or ported kernel | CPU-reference correctness gate + `rocprofv3 --kernel-trace` smoke (see `docs/KERNELS.md` and `docs/TESTING.md`). |
| Perf claim | Re-run the exact benchmark command from `docs/BENCHMARK.md` on stated hardware; record both runs in `WORKLOG.md`. |
| Milestone closure | Full `uv run pytest -v` + the phase's named perf target vs prior baseline. |

## Git Discipline

Explicit, auto-commit-after-validation. Many small, atomic, working-state commits with clear provenance — not fewer larger ones.

### Commit Timing

- **Commit immediately** after a logical unit is complete and validation passes. Do not ask, do not wait to be asked, and do not start the next logical task until the previous validated unit is committed.
- Include related handoff docs in the same unit (a change that needed a `WORKLOG.md` entry or a `docs/PLAN.md` update commits them together).
- Always commit `WORKLOG.md` with the logical unit that required it. Re-read the live tail before appending/staging; same-file append contention is expected, but stop for conflict markers or garbled interleaving.
- Do not commit mid-task while exploring, debugging, or in a broken state.
- Docs, plans, repo-setup, and dependency additions are first-class logical units.

### Commit Mechanics (hard rules)

- **Never** use `git add .`, `git add -A`, or `git commit -a`.
- **Never** revert, checkout, or restore files you did not modify for the current task.
- **Always** stage files explicitly: `git add <path1> <path2> …`.
- **Always** verify before committing:
  ```bash
  git status -sb
  git diff --staged --name-only
  git diff --staged
  ```
- If unrelated changes or staged files you didn't create exist, leave them alone — another agent or the human owns them.

### Commit Messages

```
type: short summary (imperative, ≤ 72 chars)

- Non-obvious context
- Source commit when porting (e.g. nano-vllm-amd@f3a1c2e)
- Correctness / perf evidence when relevant
```

Prefixes: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `refactor:`, `chore:`, `perf:`, `port:` (upstream lineage), `kernel:` (kernel edits). **No bylines** — no `Co-authored-by`, no agent attribution, no generated-by footers.

### Never Committed

- Model weights, `*.safetensors` outside fixtures
- Compiled `.so` / JIT caches, `rocprofv3` dumps, raw benchmark logs
- Local env / secrets, Python caches
- Vendored upstream repos (nano-vllm-amd, FastDMS, etc. — referenced by absolute path)

### Never Discard Others' Work

Do not run `git restore`, `git checkout --`, `git reset --hard`, `git clean -fd`, `rm -rf` across tracked paths, or bulk rewrites (aggressive formatters, mass import reordering) unless the user explicitly asks.

## Coordination

Working tree is shared state. Other agents or the human may be editing concurrently.

- **High-conflict files:** `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/PLAN.md`, `docs/BENCHMARK.md`, `docs/TESTING.md`, `docs/KERNELS.md`, `docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md`, `WORKLOG.md`, `pyproject.toml`, `hipengine/kernels/registry.py`, `hipengine/quant/registry.py`, `hipengine/models/registry.py`, `hipengine/dispatch/fusion.py`, `hipengine/core/*`.
- Same-file contention: stop and coordinate. The designated agent stages and commits their scoped hunks first to unblock others.
- `WORKLOG.md` appends are expected and not a conflict unless there are actual conflict markers or interleaved garbled lines. Re-read the live tail, append after it, commit with your logical unit.
- Do not clean up another agent's benchmark outputs, staged files, or local artifacts unless the task explicitly asks for that cleanup.

## External Reference Repos

Read-only peers under `/home/lhl/`. Do not edit as part of a hipEngine task. When porting, record source file + commit in the commit message. If an external reference disagrees with `docs/PLAN.md`, `docs/PLAN.md` wins unless we explicitly decide the reference is correct and update `docs/PLAN.md`.

- `~/amd-gpu-tuning/` — parent workspace; **kernel R&D home**, benchmark history, `LESSONS-LEARNED.md`.
- `~/amd-gpu-tuning/nano-vllm-amd/` — kernel source of truth for the Phase-0 port.
- `~/FastDMS/` — DMS reference (Phase 4).
- `~/FastKMS/` — DFlash speculative decode reference.
- `~/kvcache-quantization-research/` — AQUA / HIGGS / DMS stacking research.

## Handling Blockers

| Situation | Action |
| --- | --- |
| ROCm env appears corrupted | Record symptoms in `WORKLOG.md` before any restore; follow the `~/amd-gpu-tuning` `therock` restore commands if clearly required. |
| Kernel hangs with GPU at 0%, no error | Stale JIT cache. See `docs/KERNELS.md` "JIT cache gotcha". |
| `rocprofv3` reports unexpected kernel | Registry / dispatch bug, not a kernel bug. Check `fusion.plan()` output before touching the kernel. |
| Math change lacks an oracle/test | Stop and add a CPU-reference/golden fixture first, or record an explicit no-RED rationale in `WORKLOG.md`. |
| KL / top-1 regression after a kernel edit | Revert, add a correctness fixture that captures the failure, then re-try. Never land a perf win that regresses correctness. |
| Kernel micro-opt shows neutral / negative results | Re-run the pre-optimization audit in `~/amd-gpu-tuning/`; do not keep tweaking. |
| Merge conflict in a high-conflict file | Stop and coordinate. Do not force-stage or revert. |
| Unclear whether a change crosses a plugin-registry boundary | Check `docs/PLAN.md` "Extensibility Design" first; if still unclear, ask the human lead. |
| Unrelated files changed in the worktree | Leave them. Another agent or the human owns them. |

## Communication

- Lead with the substantive finding or result, not just what command was run.
- Distinguish measured from inferred: "measured X tok/s on Y hardware with Z command" vs "expected to be X based on Y".
- If work is still in progress, state the current concrete result or explicitly say there is no result yet.
