# Build: Execute Plan with Quality Gates

**Goal:** Implement the approved plan, task by task, with TDD and graduated quality gates.

## Active Skills

- **Context Engineering** — load hierarchical context at stage start (rules → arch → source → errors, under 2K lines/task)
- **Temper Core** — stack detection, pack resolution, quality gates
- **Source-Driven Development** — before writing framework-specific code: detect installed version → fetch current docs → cite sources → surface API conflicts. Skip for plain logic or known patterns

## Prerequisites

- Approved plan exists (from `/temper:plan`)
- OR: user provides inline instructions for trivial tasks

## Execution

### Context Loading

This stage may run in two modes:
- **Standalone** (`/temper:build`) — runs in current context, handles its own gate
- **Agent subprocess** (from `/temper`) — starts with CLEAN context, only loads what's listed below

**Subprocess mode override:** When running as an Agent subprocess, do NOT show AskUserQuestion gates or clear context. Return the build summary to the orchestrator. The orchestrator handles all gate decisions and context transitions.

In both modes, the build methodology is identical.

Files to load at start:
1. `.temper/specs/{feature}/tasks.md`
2. `.temper/specs/{feature}/intent.md` (if exists)
3. `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/.claude-plugin/reference/build.md` (this file)
4. `.temper/specs/{feature}/review-context.json` (if exists — loaded when re-entering from feedback loop)
5. `.temper/specs/{feature}/check-context.json` (if exists — loaded when re-entering from Check failure)

### Step 1: Load Plan

```
1. Check for .temper/build-state.json
   - If found: Validate it before offering resume:
     a. Parseable JSON — if malformed, warn and offer "Start over / Delete / Cancel"
     b. Valid stage — must be "plan_complete" or "build_complete" (with last_task_completed)
     c. Spec directory exists — .temper/specs/{spec}/ must exist on disk
     d. Artifacts exist — tasks.md and intent.md (if listed) must exist
     e. Timestamp — if updated > 30 days ago, warn about staleness
   - If valid: Ask user "Resume from Task {last_task_completed + 1}? [Y/n]" (skip in subprocess mode — use build-state.json directly)
   - If invalid: Show what's wrong, offer "Start over / Delete saved state / Cancel"
2. Check for active plan in .temper/specs/*/tasks.md
3. If multiple specs exist, ask user which to execute (skip in subprocess mode — use spec from build-state.json or orchestrator args)
4. Load tasks.md + quickstart.md (quickstart.md may not exist for Simple features — skip if absent)
5. Read plan.md for architecture decisions and blast radius (skip if no plan.md — Simple/Medium features)
6. Read all files listed in plan's "Prerequisites" or "Must Read" sections (skip if no plan.md)
7. Read active pack rules from .claude/packs/ (enabled packs only, skip if directory doesn't exist)
8. Read stack file from .claude/packs/stacks/{detected-stack}.md (skip if file doesn't exist)
9. Load .temper/specs/{feature}/intent.md if it exists
   - Parse scenario names and Given/When/Then blocks
   - If no intent.md: proceed with current behavior (unchanged)
```

**Build State Schema:**

```json
{
  "stage": "build_complete",
  "spec": "{feature-name}",
  "spec_path": ".temper/specs/{feature-name}",
  "original_args": "{user's original feature description}",
  "next_stage": "review",
  "artifacts": ["intent.md", "tasks.md"],
  "started": "2026-03-10T10:00:00Z",
  "last_task_completed": 3,
  "tasks": [
    { "id": 1, "status": "completed", "timestamp": "..." },
    { "id": 2, "status": "completed", "timestamp": "..." },
    { "id": 3, "status": "in_progress", "timestamp": "..." }
  ],
  "deviations": {
    "unplanned_files": [],
    "skipped_tasks": [],
    "approach_changes": []
  },
  "updated": "{ISO timestamp}"
}
```

**If no plan exists (trivial task):**

```
1. User gave direct instructions → treat as single-task build
2. Detect stack (same as /temper:check Step 1)
3. Read active pack rules
4. Read related existing code before implementing
5. Skip Step 2 (branch) — user decides if feature branch needed
```

### Step 2: Verify Branch

> Note: When running as an Agent subprocess from `/temper`, the orchestrator may have already created the branch at the plan gate. `git branch --show-current` will confirm.

```
1. Run: git branch --show-current
2. If on main/master:
   - Check if git pack is enabled in .claude/temper.config
   - If git pack enabled: auto-create feature/{spec-slug} branch
   - If no git pack: ask user to create feature branch
   - Suggest name: feature/{ticket}-{description}
3. If already on feature branch: proceed
```

### Step 3: Execute Tasks (in order)

For each task in tasks.md:

**a. Read context** - Read existing files, understand patterns, check adjacent code
**b. Write test first (priority order — first match wins)**

   1. **intent.md exists** → scenario-driven testing (regardless of TDD pack)
      - Each test maps to a Gherkin scenario by name
      - Given block → test setup
      - When block → action under test
      - Then block → assertions
      - One test per scenario minimum (some scenarios may need multiple tests)
      - When both intent.md AND TDD pack exist: intent.md drives WHAT to test, TDD pack enforces HOW (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR discipline, test conventions)
   2. **TDD pack enabled, no intent.md** → RED-GREEN-REFACTOR from pack rules
   3. **Neither** → implement without enforced test-first
**c. Implement** - Write minimal code to pass the test or fulfill spec
**d. Validate** - Run test → GREEN, run task validation command
**e. Checkpoint + deviation tracking** - Write to `.temper/build-state.json`:

   ```json
   {
     "stage": "build_complete",
     "spec": "{feature-name}",
     "spec_path": ".temper/specs/{feature-name}",
     "original_args": "{from prior state}",
     "next_stage": "review",
     "artifacts": ["intent.md", "tasks.md"],
     "last_task_completed": {task_number},
     "tasks": [...],
     "deviations": {
       "unplanned_files": ["path/to/file — reason"],
       "skipped_tasks": [{ "id": 3, "name": "...", "reason": "..." }],
       "approach_changes": [{ "id": 2, "planned": "...", "actual": "...", "reason": "..." }]
     },
     "started": "{from prior state or current timestamp on first checkpoint}",
     "updated": "{timestamp}"
   }
   ```

   **Deviation tracking rules:**
   - Files created/modified that are NOT listed in tasks.md → add to "unplanned_files" with one-line reason
   - Tasks skipped or failed → add to "skipped_tasks" with reason
   - Tasks where approach materially differs from plan (e.g., different library, different pattern) → add to "approach_changes"
   - Only track if tasks.md exists (trivial builds have no plan to deviate from)
   - Step 3.75 (Traceability Check) will reconcile these deviations against tasks.md "Traced to:" fields

**f. Simplify** - After each task, if the `code-simplifier:code-simplifier` agent is available, run it on changed files:
   - This agent is optional — not all installations have it
   - If available: run on files you created or modified during this task
   - Focus on clarity, consistency, and maintainability
   - Preserve all functionality — simplification must not change behavior
   - Only simplify files you touched in the current task, not the entire codebase
   - If not available: skip this step, continue to checkpoint

### Step 3.5: Scenario Coverage Gate (BDD Enforcement)

After all tasks complete, before Step 4:

```
If intent.md exists:
  1. Read all scenarios from intent.md
  2. For each scenario:
     a. Find test(s) by name/description match
     b. If no test found → write test + implement if needed
     c. Run the test → must PASS
  3. If any scenario has no passing test → build cannot proceed
  4. Report:
     "Scenario Coverage: X/Y scenarios covered
      ✅ Scenario: User resets password → PasswordResetTest.test_successful_reset
      ✅ Scenario: Expired token → PasswordResetTest.test_expired_token
      ❌ Scenario: Rate limiting → MISSING — writing test..."

If no intent.md:
  Skip gate, proceed to Step 4 as before
```

### Step 3.6: Success Criteria Validation (IDD Enforcement)

After scenario coverage gate, validate code-based success criteria:

```
If intent.md exists and has success criteria with Validate: code:
  1. For each success criterion with Validate: code — {pattern}:
     a. Grep for the specified pattern/endpoint/config
     b. If found → ✅ Success criterion met
     c. If not found → ❌ WARN: "Success criterion not met: {criterion}"
  2. Report:
     "Success Criteria Validation: X/Y code criteria met
      ✅ POST /api/reset exists → found in src/routes/auth.ts:45
      ❌ Rate limit middleware applied → NOT found"
  3. Non-blocking — WARN only, does not block build

For Validate: scenario → already covered by Step 3.5
For Validate: metric/manual → deferred to /temper:review
```

**Populate Scenario Coverage Checklist in intent.md:**
After reporting coverage, write the results back to intent.md's "## Scenario Coverage Checklist" section:

```
1. Find the "## Scenario Coverage Checklist" section in intent.md
2. Replace placeholder lines with actual scenario-to-test mappings:
   - [x] {Scenario Name} → {TestClassName.test_method_name} (for passing tests)
   - [ ] {Scenario Name} → NO TEST (for missing tests - should never occur if gate passed; indicates gate logic bug)
3. Keep the section header and any existing content, only update the checklist items
```

This makes intent.md a complete record of what was planned AND what was delivered.

**Scenario-to-test mapping rules:**

- Test name should contain scenario name (snake_case or camelCase)
- Test description/docstring should reference the Gherkin scenario
- Multiple tests can map to one scenario (e.g., happy path + variant)
- One test cannot satisfy multiple scenarios

**Scenario Note handling:**
Each scenario in intent.md may have a `Note:` field specifying the testing approach:

- `Note: unit` → standard unit test (default if no Note specified)
- `Note: mock` → test with mocked external dependency, verify interaction
- `Note: integration` → write integration test if test infra exists, otherwise mock
- `Note: manual` → skip from automated coverage gate, log as "requires manual verification"

Scenarios marked `manual` count as covered in the gate but are flagged in the report:

```
Scenario Coverage: 5/5 (4 automated, 1 manual verification needed)
  ✅ Scenario: User submits form → FormTest.test_submission (automated)
  ⚠️  Scenario: Email delivered → MANUAL VERIFICATION NEEDED
```

### Step 3.7: Context Output

After all tasks complete and scenario coverage gate passes, write `build-context.json` to the spec directory:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "stage": "build",
  "timestamp": "{ISO timestamp}",
  "files_created": ["list of files created"],
  "files_modified": ["list of files modified"],
  "test_results": {
    "total": {N},
    "passed": {N},
    "failed": {N}
  },
  "deviations": {
    "unplanned_files": ["list"],
    "skipped_tasks": ["list"],
    "approach_changes": ["list"]
  },
  "scenarios_covered": ["list of covered scenario names"],
  "tasks_completed": {N},
  "tasks_total": {N}
}
```

### Feedback Re-entry (when entering from Review or Check loop)

If `review-context.json` exists in the spec directory:
1. Read it to understand what issues were found
2. Focus fixes on the specific files/issues listed
3. After fixing, delete review-context.json (stale)

If `check-context.json` exists in the spec directory:
1. Read it to understand what test failures occurred
2. For each test failure in `test_failures` array:
   - Read the failing test file
   - Read the implementation file referenced
   - Fix the issue (test or implementation, as appropriate)
3. After fixing, delete check-context.json (stale)

### "Revise Plan" Option

At the build gate (Step 4), add a third option when feedback is enabled:

If the build encounters an infeasible plan (e.g., API doesn't exist, architecture incompatible):
- Add "Revise plan" to the gate options
- Write build-context.json with infeasibility reasons
- The orchestrator handles routing back to Plan stage

### Step 3.75: Traceability Check

After scenario coverage gate passes, verify file-to-scenario traceability:

```
If tasks.md has "Traced to:" fields:
  1. Read deviations from build-state.json (populated during Step 3e checkpoints)
     - If "deviations" key missing or empty → skip deviation reconciliation, report "Traceability: no deviations to reconcile"
  2. For each unplanned file:
     → Check if it has a "Traced to:" justification. If not:
     → WARN: "Unplanned file {path} created. Trace to scenario or mark as infrastructure."
  3. For each planned file not changed:
     → WARN: "Planned file {path} was not modified. Is the task complete?"
  4. Report: "Traceability: {N}/{M} files match plan ({D} deviations tracked)"

If no "Traced to:" fields: skip (backward compatible)
```

Non-blocking — warnings only. The scenario coverage gate is the hard gate.

### Step 4: Post-Implementation

**If running as Agent subprocess:** Skip the AskUserQuestion gate. Return the build summary to the orchestrator. The orchestrator handles all gate decisions.

**If running standalone:** Show the summary and gate below.

After all tasks complete:

1. Run full test suite → all must pass
2. Show build summary:

```

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

3. Use AskUserQuestion with these options:

```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "What next?"
  options:
    - label: "Continue to Review (Recommended)"
      description: "Proceed to review. Context will be cleared, loading changed files."
    - label: "Save for later"
      description: "Save state to .temper/build-state.json and stop."
  multiSelect: false
  Note: When feedback.enabled is true in temper.config, an additional "Revise plan" option
  may be offered if build encountered infeasible design. This is at the orchestrator's discretion.
```

4. On Continue to Review (first option):
   - Signal:
     "✅ Continuing to REVIEW...
      📂 Loading: changed files only"
   - If running standalone: Load ONLY changed files (git diff --name-only).
     Focus on these files and minimize references to prior build context.
   - If running as Agent subprocess: The orchestrator handles context — return summary and stop.
   - Proceed to /temper:review

5. On Change (via "Other" free-text input):
   - User types their change request in the "Other" field
   - Make the change
   - ⚠️ MANDATORY: Re-show AskUserQuestion with same options

   GATE ENFORCEMENT: The user's change input is NOT approval to proceed.
   Do NOT skip to review after making changes. The user MUST explicitly
   select "Continue to Review" from the gate to proceed.

6. On Save for later (second option):
   - Save state to .temper/build-state.json (preserving existing deviations/started/tasks fields):
     ```json
     {
       "stage": "build_complete",
       "spec": "{feature-slug}",
       "spec_path": ".temper/specs/{feature-slug}",
       "original_args": "{from prior state}",
       "next_stage": "review",
       "artifacts": ["intent.md", "tasks.md"],
       "deviations": "{from current state}",
       "last_task_completed": "{from current state}",
       "tasks": "{from current state}",
       "started": "{from current state}",
       "updated": "{ISO timestamp}"
     }
     ```
   - Report: "✅ Saved. Run /temper when ready to continue."

7. (Cleanup is handled by check.md after commit — do NOT delete build-state.json here)
8. Mark spec as completed:
   - If intent.md exists: add `**Status:** completed` and `**Completed:** {date}` to header

## Quality Gates

For quality gate definitions, apply the temper-core skill.

**Pattern-to-rule mapping:**

| Code Pattern | Pack Rule | Level |
|--------------|-----------|-------|
| SQL string concatenation | security: no SQL concat | BLOCK |
| Hardcoded API keys/passwords | security: no secrets | BLOCK |
| DB access from controller | architecture: use service layer | BLOCK |
| Public method without test | tdd: test all public methods | WARN |
| Method > 30 lines | quality: method length | WARN |
| Magic numbers | quality: named constants | SUGGEST |
| 4+ nesting levels | quality: max 3 nesting | WARN |
| Empty catch block | quality: no swallowed exceptions | WARN |

## Error Recovery

```
COMPILATION ERROR: Read full error → identify type → fix → retry (max 3)
TEST FAILURE (new test): Test may be wrong OR implementation wrong → investigate
TEST FAILURE (existing test): REGRESSION → your code broke something → fix your code
STUCK: Re-read plan → re-read similar code → break down task → ask user if needed
```
