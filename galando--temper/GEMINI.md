# Plan: Feature Planning with Impact Analysis

**Goal:** Transform feature request into implementation plan with blast radius analysis and risk assessment.

## Active Skills

- **Context Engineering** — load hierarchical context at stage start (rules → arch → source → errors, under 2K lines/task)
- **Temper Core** — stack detection, pack resolution, quality gates

## Usage

```
/temper:plan "feature description"
/temper:plan "JIRA-123"
/temper:plan "#123"
/temper:plan --full "feature"    # Force full spec-kit even for simple tasks
/temper:plan --quick "feature"   # Force lightweight plan
/temper:plan --reindex "feature" # Force full semantic index rebuild
```

## Feature: $ARGUMENTS

## Execution

### Context Loading

This stage may run in two modes:
- **Standalone** (`/temper:plan`) — runs in current context, handles its own gate
- **Agent subprocess** (from `/temper`) — runs in clean context, returns summary to orchestrator

**Subprocess mode override:** When running as an Agent subprocess, do NOT show AskUserQuestion gates or clear context. Return the plan summary to the orchestrator. The orchestrator handles all gate decisions and context transitions.

In both modes, the planning methodology is identical.

**Context loading strategy:** Apply the context-engineering skill for hierarchical loading (rules -> arch -> source -> errors, under 2K lines/task). The file list below specifies WHAT to load; the skill specifies HOW and WHEN.

### Phase 0: Detect Input Type

Determine what the user provided:

- Starts with a project prefix + numbers (e.g., `BKNG-1234`, `PROJ-567`) → fetch from Jira API using `gh` or `curl`
- Starts with `#` + numbers (e.g., `#1234`) → fetch from GitHub Issues using `gh issue view`
- URL containing `github.com` → fetch from GitHub using `gh`
- URL containing `atlassian.net` or `jira` → fetch from Jira API
- Everything else → use as direct feature description

**If issue tracker fetch fails:** Fall back to using the raw text as description. Never block on API failures.

### Phase 0.5: Initial File Count Estimate

Before launching the Explore subagent, make a rough estimate to guide planning depth:

```
ESTIMATION HEURISTIC:

| Feature Type | Typical Files | Complexity |
|-------------|---------------|------------|
| Single endpoint/page/handler | 3-5 | Simple |
| New domain/module | 7-12 | Medium-Complex |
| Cross-cutting (auth, middleware) | 10-25 | Complex |
| External service integration | 5-8 | Medium |
```

Pre-estimate only. Explore subagent refines with actual codebase knowledge.

### Phase 1: Auto-Prime (via Explore subagent)

Launch an Explore subagent with this prompt:

```
Scan this project to build a reference map for planning a new feature.

0. CODE REVIEW GRAPH MCP (PRIMARY exploration method)
   If code-review-graph MCP tools are available:
   a. Call build_or_update_graph_tool to ensure the graph is up-to-date
   b. Call get_architecture_overview_tool for high-level codebase structure
   c. Call list_communities_tool to understand code grouping
   d. Call list_flows_tool (limit 20) to identify key execution paths
   e. Call semantic_search_nodes_tool with keywords from the feature description
   f. Call get_minimal_context_tool with the feature description for a quick overview
   → Use these results as the PRIMARY source for dependency maps, patterns, and similar code
   → Still verify with direct file reads where needed
   If MCP is unavailable, proceed with grep/read steps below as fallback.

1. DETECT STACK
   - Look for: package.json, pom.xml, build.gradle, pyproject.toml, go.mod, Cargo.toml
   - Read the detected manifest to understand dependencies
   - Check for temper.config (stack override)

2. SCAN PROJECT STRUCTURE
   - List top-level directories
   - Identify source roots (src/, app/, lib/, etc.)
   - Count files by type to understand project scale

3. MAP PATTERNS
   For each layer found, note 1-2 example files:
   - Controllers/routes (API layer)
   - Services (business logic)
   - Repositories/DAOs (data access)
   - Models/entities
   - DTOs/schemas
   - Tests (unit + integration)
   - Configuration files

4. FIND SIMILAR IMPLEMENTATIONS
   Search for existing code similar to the planned feature.
   First try semantic_search_nodes_tool with feature keywords (if MCP available).
   Then grep for keywords from the feature description.

5. CHECK FOR COMPANY PRESET
   - Read .claude/temper.config if exists
   - Read .claude/presets/*.yaml if exists
   - Read enabled pack rules from .claude/packs/

6. READ SEMANTIC INDEX (if exists)
   - Read .temper/index/modules.json for dependency graph
   - Read .temper/index/api-surface.json for API map
   - If index doesn't exist or is stale, build it:
     - Map all imports/requires across the project
     - List all API endpoints with their handler functions
     - List all test files and what they test

Return a reference map in this format (max 60 lines):

STACK: {detected stack}
PRESET: {preset name or "none"}
PACKS: {enabled packs}

PROJECT STRUCTURE:
  {directory tree, 2 levels deep}

PATTERNS:
  Controllers: {pattern + example file}
  Services: {pattern + example file}
  Repositories: {pattern + example file}
  Tests: {pattern + example file}

SIMILAR CODE:
  {1-3 similar implementations found, with file paths}

DEPENDENCY MAP (relevant to this feature):
  {which modules would be affected}

TEST COVERAGE:
  {files related to this feature and whether they have tests}
```

### Phase 1.5: Validate Subagent Results

```
Missing sections:
  - No controllers → look for entry points, exported functions, main files
  - No tests → TDD creates from scratch; lower coverage expectations; flag in risk
  - No similar code → new capability, higher risk, more questions in Phase 5
  - Stack detection failed → ask user, or check Makefile/Dockerfile/CI config

Reference map too large (>60 lines) → keep only sections relevant to feature
Subagent timeout/failure → fall back to manual exploration, flag lower confidence
```

### Phase 1.6: Semantic Index (Optional Enhancement)

The semantic index accelerates blast radius analysis by pre-computing dependency graphs. It's optional — if missing, the Explore subagent builds equivalent knowledge ad-hoc.

**Index files:**

```
.temper/index/
├── modules.json      # Import/dependency graph
└── api-surface.json  # API endpoints and handlers
```

**modules.json schema:**

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "last_built": "2026-03-15T10:00:00Z",
  "modules": {
    "src/services/AuthService.ts": {
      "imports": ["src/models/User.ts", "src/utils/jwt.ts"],
      "imported_by": ["src/controllers/AuthController.ts", "src/middleware/auth.ts"],
      "exports": ["AuthService", "verifyToken"]
    }
  }
}
```

**api-surface.json schema:**

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "last_built": "2026-03-15T10:00:00Z",
  "endpoints": [
    {
      "method": "POST",
      "path": "/api/auth/login",
      "handler": "src/controllers/AuthController.ts:login",
      "middleware": ["src/middleware/rateLimit.ts"]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Index staleness detection:**

- Compare `last_built` timestamp to git's last commit timestamp
- If `last_built` < last commit → rebuild (or use `--reindex` flag)

**Index building (if needed):**

```
1. Find all source files (exclude node_modules, vendor, dist)
2. For each file:
   a. Parse imports/requires
   b. Parse exports
   c. Build reverse dependency map
3. For API routes:
   a. Detect framework (Express, Fastify, Spring, etc.)
   b. Parse route definitions
   c. Map to handler functions
4. Write to .temper/index/
```

**Skip index if:**

- Project < 50 files (ad-hoc analysis is fast enough)
- No .temper/ directory exists yet
- User passed `--quick` flag

### Phase 2: Research (via Research subagent, if needed)

Only launch if the feature involves external libraries or APIs not already in the project:

```
Research the following for implementation guidance:
- {library/API name} documentation
- Known issues and gotchas
- Code examples for {specific use case}

Return only the relevant snippets (max 30 lines).
```

### Phase 3: Assess Complexity + Risk

Based on the reference map, determine:

**File count estimate:**

- How many files need to be created?
- How many files need to be modified?
- Total = created + modified

**Complexity level:**

| Files | Level |
|-------|-------|
| <3 | Trivial → skip planning, just implement |
| 3-5 | Simple → inline plan in conversation |
| 5-10 | Medium → tasks.md + quickstart.md |
| 10+ | Complex → full spec/plan/tasks/quickstart |

**Risk multipliers** (each adds +1 to complexity level):

- Touches payment, auth, or security code
- Modifies shared library consumed by 5+ other modules
- Changes database schema
- Module has historically high defect rate (check .temper/metrics.json if exists)
- Security hot path detected (Phase 4.1 sensitivity CRITICAL or HIGH)

**Override:** If user passed `--full`, use Complex. If `--quick`, use Simple.

### Phase 4: Blast Radius Analysis

Using the reference map and semantic index:

MCP BLAST RADIUS (before grep-based steps):
  If code-review-graph MCP server is available and tools.mode is not heuristic-only:
  1. Call get_impact_radius_tool with the planned file list
  2. Returns [PROVEN]:
     - Direct consumers (files importing planned files)
     - Transitive impact (files depending on consumers)
     - Risk scores per file
     - Fan-in / fan-out metrics
  3. If MCP available: SKIP grep-based steps 2-3 below (MCP provides superior results)
     Always run steps 4-5 (contract changes, architectural drift) — MCP doesn't detect these
  4. Evidence label: [PROVEN] on all MCP-sourced findings
  If MCP unavailable:
     Proceed with grep-based steps 1-5 as [HEURISTIC]

1. List files that will likely be changed (preliminary — refined after scenarios in Phase 4.5)
2. For each changed file, find all importers/consumers
3. For each consumer, check if it has test coverage for the affected code path
4. Flag any contract changes (API response shapes, event payloads, DB schemas)
5. Flag any architectural drift (new code bypassing established patterns)

**Output format (included in plan and review):**

```
BLAST RADIUS — {feature-name}

  Direct impact:
    {File} ({action}) → used by {N} consumers
    {File} ({action}) → no existing consumers yet

  Transitive impact:
    {Module} → calls {changed-function}()
    {Module} → subscribes to {event}()

  Risk areas:
    {Module} has {X}% test coverage for {path}
    {Module} handler not updated for new payload shape

  Architectural compliance:
    ✅ {pattern} followed
    ✅ {pattern} followed
    ⚠️ {concern}
```

### Phase 4.1: Security Hot Path Detection

During blast radius analysis, classify changed files by security sensitivity and trace call chains to entry points. This proactively identifies security risks before code is written.

**Security sensitivity classification:**

| Level | Keywords/Patterns | Examples |
|-------|-------------------|----------|
| CRITICAL | auth, crypto, payment, secret, password, token, encrypt, decrypt, PII | AuthService, PaymentService, TokenService |
| HIGH | session, permission, role, rate-limit, validate, sanitize, admin | SessionManager, PermissionGuard, RateLimiter |
| MEDIUM | logging, error-handling, api-route, handler, middleware | ErrorHandler, RequestLogger, ApiMiddleware |
| LOW | config, constants, types, helpers, utils, DTOs | AppConfig, Constants, Types |

**Detection steps:**

```
1. CLASSIFY each file in the blast radius by sensitivity:
   - Match file path + function names against the classification table
   - File inherits the HIGHEST sensitivity of any function it contains
   - Default: LOW (unknown files)

2. For CRITICAL and HIGH files, trace call chains to entry points:
   a. Find all IMPORTERS of the changed file:
      grep "from.*{file}" OR "require.*{file}" OR import("{file}")
   b. For each importer, determine if it's an ENTRY POINT:
      - HTTP handler/controller/route → Web entry point
      - CLI command/main function → CLI entry point
      - Worker/job processor → Background entry point
      - WebSocket handler → Real-time entry point
      - Event subscriber → Async entry point
   c. Build call chain: Entry Point → Intermediate → Changed Code

3. ASSESS security exposure per call chain:
   - Reachable from UNAUTHENTICATED endpoint → exposure: PUBLIC
   - Reachable from AUTHENTICATED endpoint → exposure: AUTHENTICATED
   - Reachable from ADMIN-only endpoint → exposure: ADMIN
   - Not reachable from any entry point → exposure: INTERNAL

4. FLAG security risks:
   - CRITICAL file reachable from PUBLIC endpoint → CRITICAL risk
   - CRITICAL file reachable from AUTHENTICATED endpoint → HIGH risk
   - HIGH file without test coverage → HIGH risk
   - Any sensitive file with no entry point trace → MEDIUM risk (dead code or missing integration)
```

**Output — add to blast radius section:**

```
SECURITY IMPACT:
  {File} ({function}) → {CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM}
    Reachable from: {entry point} ({exposure level})
    Risk: {specific risk description}
    Recommendation: {actionable suggestion}
```

**Example output:**

```
SECURITY IMPACT:
  src/services/PaymentService.ts (processRefund) → CRITICAL
    Reachable from: POST /api/refunds (AUTHENTICATED)
    Risk: User could refund any payment if authorization check missing
    Recommendation: Add scenario "User can only refund own payments"

  src/middleware/auth.ts (verifyToken) → HIGH
    Reachable from: 47 endpoints (PUBLIC + AUTHENTICATED)
    Risk: Token validation bug affects all authenticated endpoints
    Recommendation: Add integration test for expired/invalid tokens

  src/utils/logger.ts (formatLogEntry) → LOW
    Reachable from: Internal only
    Risk: No security impact
```

**Integration with risk assessment:**
- Security hot path findings add to the Phase 3 risk multipliers
- Each CRITICAL finding → +1 complexity level
- Each HIGH finding → consider adding security-focused scenario in Phase 4.5
- Security findings persist to `.temper/security-map.json` for use in review and check phases

**State:** Creates `.temper/security-map.json`:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "last_updated": "{ISO timestamp}",
  "hot_paths": [
    {
      "file": "src/services/PaymentService.ts",
      "function": "processRefund",
      "sensitivity": "CRITICAL",
      "entry_points": [
        {
          "route": "POST /api/refunds",
          "exposure": "AUTHENTICATED",
          "has_auth_middleware": true,
          "has_authorization_check": false
        }
      ],
      "last_reviewed": "{ISO timestamp}"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Phase 4.5: Derive Scenarios (BDD — before architecture)

**Why before architecture:** Scenarios define the behaviors the system must support. Architecture decisions should be driven by these behaviors, not the other way around. This prevents over-engineering (planning files no scenario needs) and scope gaps (missing behaviors that blast radius revealed).

**Skip for Trivial/Simple** — no intent.md generated for these levels.

For Medium and Complex, generate Gherkin scenarios from:

```
SOURCE                              BECOMES
------                              -------
User's feature description    →     Happy path scenarios
Acceptance criteria (issue)   →     Happy path + validation scenarios
Blast radius: risk areas      →     Edge case / error scenarios
Blast radius: affected consumers →  Regression guard scenarios ("existing X still works")
```

**Scenario derivation rules:**

```
Every blast radius risk area → at least one scenario
Every acceptance criterion → at least one scenario
Every affected consumer → a regression guard scenario
Scenarios must be concrete: specific inputs, specific expected outputs
Each scenario must be testable (no "system works correctly")
```

**Scenario count:**

- Medium: 3-8 scenarios (happy path, error path, edge case)
- Complex: 5-15 scenarios (happy path, error paths, edge cases, regression guards)

**Assign testing approach (Note field) per scenario:**

| Behavior Type | Note | When to Use |
|--------------|------|-------------|
| `unit` | Default | Pure logic, no external dependencies |
| `mock` | External dependency | Calls API, sends email, writes to queue |
| `integration` | Cross-boundary | Database queries, multi-service flow |
| `manual` | Non-automatable | UI/UX verification, visual output, email delivery confirmation |

**Output:** A draft list of scenarios that will be written into intent.md in Phase 6. These scenarios now inform Phase 5 (questions) and Phase 6 (architecture/file planning).

**Reconcile with Phase 4 file list:**
After deriving scenarios, check if new files are needed that weren't in the Phase 4 preliminary list — add them. Also check if any Phase 4 files have no scenario or infrastructure justification — flag for removal or justify as infrastructure.

### Phase 5: Ask Clarifying Questions (if ambiguous)

Only ask when genuinely ambiguous — don't ask for the sake of asking. Use AskUserQuestion with concrete options:

Good: "Should this integrate with existing PaymentService or create a new one?"
Bad: "What should the architecture be?"

Scenarios from Phase 4.5 may reveal ambiguities that weren't visible from the feature description alone. Maximum 2-3 questions. If requirements are clear, skip this phase entirely.

### Phase 6: Generate Plan Artifacts

**ENFORCEMENT OVERRIDE (when running from `/temper` unified command):** Always generate the full artifact set regardless of complexity level. Always create: intent.md, tasks.md, plan.md with mermaid diagram, blast radius analysis. Present the full 4-option approval gate with walkthrough. This overrides the complexity-tiered rules below.

**Complexity-tiered rules (for standalone `/temper:plan` only):**

**For Trivial:** No artifacts. Tell user: "Small change. I'll implement directly."

**For Simple:** Inline plan in conversation. No files created:

```
Plan: {feature name}
Files to create: {list}
Files to modify: {list}
Tasks:
1. {task} → validate: {command}
2. {task} → validate: {command}
```

**For Medium:** Create `.temper/specs/{feature-slug}/`:

- `intent.md` — WHY + WHAT: Intent section (problem, success criteria, constraints) + Gherkin scenarios
- `tasks.md` — ordered implementation steps
- `quickstart.md` — 10-line summary

**For Complex:** Create `.temper/specs/{feature-slug}/`:

- `spec.md` — WHAT: requirements, acceptance criteria, edge cases
- `intent.md` — WHY + WHAT: Intent section (problem, success criteria, constraints) + Gherkin scenarios
- `plan.md` — HOW: architecture, file changes, patterns, blast radius
- `tasks.md` — DO: ordered steps with validation command per task
- `quickstart.md` — TLDR: 10-line summary

**For Trivial/Simple:** No intent.md

#### intent.md Generation

The intent.md file combines IDD (Intent-Driven Development) and BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) in one artifact:

**Intent Section (IDD):**

- Problem: derived from user's feature description + linked issue
- Success criteria: measurable outcomes from acceptance criteria, each with a `Validate:` field
- Constraints: technical/business limitations from blast radius + pack rules
- Target users: who benefits from this feature

**For Complex features (spec.md + intent.md both exist):**

- `spec.md` = WHAT (requirements from stakeholder perspective, acceptance criteria)
- `intent.md` = WHY + HOW TO VERIFY (success criteria, scenarios for validation)
- Derive intent.md success criteria FROM spec.md acceptance criteria
- Each spec.md acceptance criterion → at least one intent.md scenario
- spec.md edge cases → intent.md edge case scenarios

**Success criteria validation types:**

| Type | When to Use | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| `scenario` | Criterion maps to a Gherkin scenario | `Validate: scenario — covered by "User resets password"` |
| `code` | Criterion verifiable by checking code exists | `Validate: code — endpoint exists at POST /api/reset` |
| `metric` | Criterion requires post-deploy measurement | `Validate: metric — measure support ticket volume post-deploy` |
| `manual` | Criterion requires human judgment | `Validate: manual — UX review needed` |

Prefer `scenario` and `code` — these are mechanically verifiable. Use `metric` and `manual` only when mechanical validation is impossible.

**Scenarios Section (BDD):**
Scenarios are derived in Phase 4.5 (before architecture). Write them into intent.md here.

Use templates from `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/templates/` (spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md, quickstart.md) as the base structure. Fill in from reference map and blast radius analysis.

#### Diagram Generation (Mermaid + ASCII)

For Medium and Complex features, generate a mermaid diagram in the plan.md `## Diagram` section. Choose the diagram type based on what best communicates the feature:

| Situation | Diagram Type | When to Use |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Component interactions | `flowchart` | Multiple modules/services communicating |
| Data flow | `flowchart` with subgraphs | Data moves through layers or boundaries |
| State machines | `stateDiagram-v2` | Entities with lifecycle states |
| Cross-boundary sequences | `sequenceDiagram` | API calls, service-to-service, user journeys |
| Type hierarchies | `classDiagram` | New types with inheritance or composition |

**When running from `/temper` (unified command):** Always generate a diagram. Even for Simple features, a minimal diagram showing the files and their relationships adds value.

**When running standalone `/temper:plan`:** Skip diagram for single-file changes or config-only changes only.

**Guidelines:**
- Keep diagrams under 30 nodes — split into multiple diagrams if needed
- Use descriptive node names (not abbreviations)
- Color-code with mermaid `classDef` when distinguishing new vs existing components:
  ```
  classDef new fill:#e1f5fe,stroke:#0288d1
  classDef existing fill:#f5f5f5,stroke:#9e9e9e
  classDef modified fill:#fff3e0,stroke:#f57c00
  ```
- Include a legend note above the diagram when using colors

**Example flowchart:**
```
flowchart TD
    A[Client Request] --> B[API Controller]
    B --> C[Service Layer]
    C --> D[(Database)]
    C --> E[Cache]

    class A,B,C new
    class D,E existing
```

**Example sequenceDiagram:**
```
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant API as AuthController
    participant S as AuthService
    participant DB as Database

    U->>API: POST /login
    API->>S: authenticate(credentials)
    S->>DB: findUser(email)
    DB-->>S: user record
    S-->>API: token or error
    API-->>U: 200 or 401
```

#### ASCII Art Generation (alongside mermaid)

For every mermaid diagram generated, also produce an ASCII art equivalent and write it to plan.md **below** the mermaid block, inside a ` ```text ` fence.

**Why:** The terminal cannot render mermaid markdown. ASCII art is readable without any tooling.

**ASCII art rules by diagram type:**

| Diagram Type | ASCII Style |
|-------------|-------------|
| `flowchart` | `+---+` boxes connected with `-->` arrows, vertical flow |
| `sequenceDiagram` | Vertical participant lanes (`|`), horizontal `-->` messages |
| `stateDiagram-v2` | `+---+` state boxes, `-->` transitions with labels |
| `classDiagram` | `+---+` class boxes with `|---|` attribute dividers |

**General rules:**
- Box corners: `+`, walls: `|` (vertical), `-` (horizontal)
- Forward arrow: `-->`, backward: `<--`, bidirectional: `<-->`
- Labels on edges: place above or beside the arrow line
- Max width: 80 columns; abbreviate node labels if needed
- Subgraphs: indent contained nodes by 2 spaces
- Use blank lines to separate groups

**Example flowchart ASCII:**
```text
+----------+       +----------+       +----------+
| NodeA    | --->  | NodeB    | --->  | NodeC    |
+----------+       +----------+       +----------+
```

**Example sequenceDiagram ASCII:**
```text
  User          API          Database
   |             |              |
   |-- request ->|              |
   |             |-- query ---> |
   |             |<-- result ---|
   |<-- response-|              |
```

**Output in plan.md `## Diagram` section:**
```
\`\`\`mermaid
{mermaid diagram content}
\`\`\`

\`\`\`text
{ASCII art equivalent}
\`\`\`
```

**Populate `Traced to:` in tasks.md:**
When generating tasks.md, fill the `Traced to:` field for each task:

- If the task creates/modifies a file needed by a scenario → `Traced to: Scenario: "scenario name"`
- If a task covers multiple scenarios → list all: `Traced to: Scenario: "name1", "name2"`
- If the task is infrastructure (config, migration, build setup) → `Traced to: Infrastructure: required by {module/file}`
- If a task cannot be traced → question whether it's needed (see File-to-Scenario Traceability)

#### File-to-Scenario Traceability

Every file in the plan must justify its existence. Files fall into two categories:

```
Scenario-traced files (must link to at least one scenario):
  src/services/PasswordResetService.ts  → Scenario: "User resets password"
  src/middleware/RateLimiter.ts          → Scenario: "Rate limiting enforced"

Infrastructure files (no scenario required, but must state dependency):
  db/migrations/001_add_reset_tokens.sql → Required by PasswordResetService
  config/email.ts                        → Required by PasswordResetService
```

If a planned file cannot be traced to any scenario AND is not infrastructure:

- Question whether it's needed
- If it is needed, a scenario is missing — add one in Phase 4.5

This prevents over-engineering: no file exists without a behavioral or infrastructural reason.

#### Task Ordering in tasks.md

Order tasks by layer (dependencies first):

```
1. Infrastructure (config, DB migrations, build setup)
2. Core (models, services, business logic)
3. Integration (controllers, routes, API endpoints)
4. Tests (integration tests, E2E)
```

#### Parallel Task Detection

Analyze task pairs for file independence. Mark independent tasks with `[PARALLEL: with Task X]`:

```
ANALYSIS RULES:

Two tasks CAN run in parallel if:
- They modify different files (no overlap)
- Neither depends on the other's output
- No shared mutable state

Two tasks MUST be sequential if:
- Task B imports from Task A's file
- Task B tests Task A's code
- Task B depends on Task A's config changes

MARKING FORMAT:
- Sequential: `## Task 1 — {title} [SEQUENTIAL]`
- Sequential after another: `## Task 2 — {title} [SEQUENTIAL: after Task 1]`
- Parallel with another: `## Task 3 — {title} [PARALLEL: with Task 4]`

GUARD: When in doubt, keep sequential. Parallel marking is an optimization, not a requirement.
```

### Phase 7: Present for Approval

Show a summary box, then offer two ways to proceed: the quick summary (current behavior) or an interactive step-by-step walkthrough.

**For Medium/Complex features:**

```

#### Approval Gate

Use AskUserQuestion with these options:

```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "What would you like to do with this plan?"
  options:
    - label: "Continue to Build (Recommended)"
      description: "Proceed to build. Context will be cleared, loading tasks.md + intent.md."
    - label: "Walk through plan step by step"
      description: "Interactive walkthrough: each step explained in detail with Q&A at each point."
    - label: "Save for later"
      description: "Save state to .temper/build-state.json and stop."
  multiSelect: false
```

| Response | Action |
|----------|--------|
| **Continue** (first option) | Proceed to build. Signal context clear, load tasks.md + intent.md |
| **Walk through** (second option) | Enter interactive step-by-step mode (see below) |
| **Save** (third option) | Save state to .temper/build-state.json, stop here |
| **Other** (built-in free-text) | Type a change request. Edits are made, gate re-appears. See "On Change" section below. |

#### Step-by-Step Walkthrough Mode

When the user selects "Walk through plan step by step", present the plan as an interactive flow:

**Structure the walkthrough as these sections (one at a time):**

1. **Intent Deep Dive** — Full problem statement, success criteria with validation methods, constraints
2. **Diagram Walkthrough** — Show the diagram and explain each node/edge, what's new vs existing vs modified
3. **Scenario Review** — For each BDD scenario: show the Gherkin, explain why it exists (which blast radius risk or acceptance criterion it addresses)
4. **Architecture Details** — For each file to create/modify: what it does, which patterns it follows, which scenarios it traces to
5. **Blast Radius Review** — Each impacted consumer, whether tests exist for that path, what regression guards are in place
6. **Task Walkthrough** — For each task in tasks.md: what it does, validation command, dependencies on prior tasks, parallel opportunities

**Interactive flow per section:**

```
After presenting each section, use AskUserQuestion:

AskUserQuestion:
  question: "What would you like to do?"
  options:
    - label: "Next step"
      description: "Continue to {next section name}."
    - label: "Ask a question"
      description: "Type your question about this section."
  multiSelect: false
```

**Handling user interactions during walkthrough:**

- **"Ask a question"**: Answer the question, then re-show the same section's AskUserQuestion
- **"Next step"**: Advance to the next section. After the last section (Task Walkthrough), transition to the final gate:

**Final walkthrough gate (after all sections):**

```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "Walkthrough complete. What next?"
  options:
    - label: "Continue to Build (Recommended)"
      description: "Proceed to build. Context will be cleared, loading tasks.md + intent.md."
    - label: "Save for later"
      description: "Save state to .temper/build-state.json and stop."
  multiSelect: false
```

**ENFORCEMENT OVERRIDE (when running from `/temper` unified command):** Always use the full 6-section walkthrough and the full 4-option approval gate. No complexity-based shortcuts. This overrides the rules below.

**Complexity-tiered rules (for standalone `/temper:plan` only):**

**For Trivial features:** No walkthrough — these show a "Small change — implementing directly" box with no gate. Trivial features skip the AskUserQuestion entirely.

**For Simple features:** Walkthrough has only 2 sections: Architecture Details (files to create/modify) + Blast Radius Review (risk level and justification).

**On Continue (first option):**

```
1. Write to .temper/build-state.json:
   {
     "stage": "plan_complete",
     "spec": "{feature-slug}",
     "spec_path": ".temper/specs/{feature-slug}",
     "original_args": "{user's original feature description}",
     "next_stage": "build",
     "artifacts": ["intent.md", "tasks.md"],
     "updated": "{ISO timestamp}"
   }

2. If running standalone (/temper:plan):
   Signal context transition:
   "✅ Continuing to BUILD...
    📂 Loading: tasks.md + intent.md only"

   Note: In standalone mode, context is shared. Load ONLY what's needed for build:
   - .temper/specs/{feature}/tasks.md
   - .temper/specs/{feature}/intent.md (if exists)
   Focus on these files and minimize references to prior planning context.

3. If running as Agent subprocess (from /temper):
   The orchestrator handles context — return summary and stop.

4. Proceed to /temper:build (or continue if using unified /temper)
```

**On Change (via "Other" free-text input):**

```
1. User types their change request in the "Other" field
2. Make the change
3. ⚠️ MANDATORY: Re-show AskUserQuestion with same options

GATE ENFORCEMENT: The user's change input is NOT approval to proceed.
Do NOT skip to the next stage after making changes. The user MUST
explicitly select "Continue to Build" from the gate to proceed.
```

**On Save for later (third option):**

```
1. Save state to .temper/build-state.json:
   ```json
   {
     "stage": "plan_complete",
     "spec": "{feature-slug}",
     "spec_path": ".temper/specs/{feature-slug}",
     "original_args": "{user's original feature description}",
     "next_stage": "build",
     "artifacts": ["intent.md", "tasks.md"],
     "updated": "{ISO timestamp}"
   }
   ```
2. Report: "✅ Saved. Run /temper when ready to continue."
```

### Context Accumulation

The planning stage produces the foundational artifacts (intent.md, tasks.md, plan.md) that all downstream stages consume. These artifacts serve as the plan context for the context accumulation system (v4.0.0).

No additional context file is needed from the Plan stage — intent.md, tasks.md, and plan.md ARE the plan context. Downstream stages read these directly.

See orchestrator-patterns.md → "Context Accumulation Patterns" for the full context schema and loading rules.

### Edge Cases

```
Vague feature description ("improve performance"):
  → Ask with AskUserQuestion: "Which part? API response times, page load, DB queries, background jobs?"
  → Narrow scope before exploring

No tests in project:
  → Flag in risk assessment, lower coverage expectations
  → Add Task 0 to plan: "Set up test infrastructure"
  → Focus on testing NEW code only

Monorepo (multiple manifests found):
  → Ask user which package/module to plan for
  → Still check blast radius across packages (shared libraries)

Database migration needed:
  → Add migration as Task 1 (before code depending on schema)
  → +1 risk multiplier for schema changes
  → Note rollback migration in plan

Feature already partially exists:
  → Reference map shows similar code → build on it, don't duplicate
  → Flag in plan: "Extending existing {module}, not creating from scratch"
```
