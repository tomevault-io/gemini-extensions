# Review: Confidence-Scored Code Review

**Goal:** Review recent changes with high signal-to-noise ratio. Parallel subagent review, confidence scoring, review memory, and intent validation.

## Active Skills

- **Context Engineering** — load hierarchical context at stage start (rules → arch → source → errors, under 2K lines/task)
- **Temper Core** — stack detection, pack resolution, quality gates

## Prerequisites

**DO NOT RUN if:**

- Code does not compile
- Tests are failing
- Build is broken

**RUN ONLY AFTER:**

- Build succeeds
- All tests pass
- Or: auto-chained from /temper:build (which already validated)

For confidence scoring and review memory, apply the temper-core skill.

## Execution

### Context Loading

This stage may run in two modes:
- **Standalone** (`/temper:review`) — runs in current context, handles its own gate
- **Agent subprocess** (from `/temper`) — starts with CLEAN context, only loads what's listed below

**Subprocess mode override:** When running as an Agent subprocess, do NOT show AskUserQuestion gates or clear context. Return the review summary to the orchestrator. The orchestrator handles all gate decisions and context transitions.

In both modes, the review methodology is identical.

Files to load at start:
1. Run `git diff --name-only` to identify changed files
2. `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/.claude-plugin/reference/review.md` (this file)
3. `.temper/specs/{feature}/intent.md` (for intent validation, if exists)
4. `.temper/specs/{feature}/build-context.json` (if exists — build deviations and test results)

### Step 1: Gather Context

```bash
# 1. Get changed files
git diff --name-only HEAD~1..HEAD  # if committed
git diff --name-only               # if uncommitted

# 2. Get diff statistics
git diff --stat HEAD

# 3. Read temper.config for review settings
# - block-on: which severities block
# - confidence-threshold: minimum confidence to show
# - auto-fix: whether to auto-fix

# 4. Read active pack rules
# - Load enabled packs from .claude/packs/
# - Load stack-specific rules from .claude/packs/stacks/{detected-stack}.md

# 5. Read review memory
# - Load .temper/review-memory.json if exists
# - Contains: dismissed patterns, accepted patterns, auto-rules

# 6. Find active intent.md
# - If chained from /temper:build: use the same spec (build context contains: spec name, feature path)
# - If single spec in .temper/specs/: use that intent.md
# - If multiple specs: check git branch name for match, or ask user which spec to review
# - If no specs: skip intent validation (existing behavior)
```

### Step 1.5: Diff-Aware Fingerprinting

Before launching subagents, build a diff fingerprint that classifies each changed region by risk level. This focuses review energy where it matters most.

```
1. Extract unified diff with context:
   git diff -U5 HEAD~1..HEAD  # if committed
   git diff -U5               # if uncommitted

2. For each changed file, classify the change:
   a. Change type:
      - ADDITION: New file (git status shows "??")
      - MODIFICATION: Existing file with hunks
      - DELETION: File removed
      - RENAME: File moved (git status shows "RNN")

   b. For MODIFICATION files, parse each hunk:
      - Identify the function/method containing the change
        (parse upward from hunk for def, function, class, const, etc.)
      - Classify the change:
        LOGIC — business logic, conditionals, calculations
        STRUCTURE — new class, new method, refactored signature
        CONFIG — settings, environment, feature flags
        TEST — test files, test helpers, fixtures
        IMPORT — import/require changes only

   c. Detect risk signals per hunk:
      - SECURITY: password, token, jwt, encrypt, decrypt, hash, auth,
        secret, credential, api-key, session
      - DATA_MUTATION: insert, update, delete, create, drop, alter,
        save, persist, remove
      - ERROR_HANDLING: throw, catch, error, exception, reject, fail
      - CONCURRENCY: async, await, promise, spawn, thread, goroutine,
        channel, mutex, lock
      - EXTERNAL_API: fetch, http, request, client, axios, curl, grpc

3. Build the fingerprint (ephemeral — not persisted):

   DIFF FINGERPRINT:
     Files: {N} changed ({A} additions, {M} modifications, {D} deletions)
     Hunks: {N} total ({L} logic, {S} structure, {C} config, {T} test, {I} import)
     High-risk regions: {N}
       - {file}:{hunk} — {risk signals}
       - {file}:{hunk} — {risk signals}
     Security sensitivity: {N} CRITICAL, {N} HIGH, {N} MEDIUM, {N} LOW
```

Pass this fingerprint to all subagents in Step 2. Subagents must:
- Focus 80% of attention on hunks with risk signals
- Review remaining changed lines at standard depth
- Include fingerprint summary in their findings

### Step 2: Launch Parallel Review Subagents

**If changed files span multiple domains (e.g., backend + frontend), launch parallel subagents.**

Each subagent receives:

```
Review the following files for issues. For each issue found, provide:
1. Severity: CRITICAL / HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW
2. Confidence: 0.0-1.0 (how certain you are this is a real issue)
3. Category: logic / security / performance / quality / standards / architecture / test-gap
4. Location: file:line
5. Description: what the issue is
6. Suggestion: how to fix it

Rules to enforce:
{content of active pack rules}

Stack-specific patterns:
{content of detected stack file}

Review these files:
{list of files in this subagent's domain}

For each file, read the ENTIRE file (not just the diff) to understand full context.

IMPORTANT:
- Only flag issues you are confident about (>0.5 confidence; Step 4 applies user-configured threshold, default 0.7)
- Do not flag style preferences unless they violate pack rules
- Do not flag patterns that are consistent with the rest of the codebase
- Focus on: logic errors, security, performance, missing tests, architectural drift

DIFF-AWARE REVIEW:
For each issue, classify as:
- REGRESSION: Code that was working before, now broken by these changes (highest priority)
- NEW ISSUE: Problem introduced by this change
- PRE-EXISTING: Issue existed before this change (lower priority, optional to fix)
Weight your focus: 80% on changed lines, 20% on context verification.

PERFORMANCE PATTERNS to check:
- N+1 queries: Loops making database/API calls
- Unbounded results: Queries without LIMIT, recursive calls without depth check
- Sync I/O in hot path: Blocking operations in request handlers, event loops
- Large objects in memory: Loading full datasets, unprocessed batch operations
- Missing pagination: Endpoints returning unbounded lists
- Inefficient data structures: Array.includes/find in loops (should be Set/Map)

PERFORMANCE ANTI-PATTERN DETECTION (for each changed file):

1. N+1 QUERY DETECTION:
   - Find loops (for/forEach/while) containing database/API calls
   - Pattern: loop body has db.query, Model.find, fetch, axios, http.request
   - FLAG as HIGH if: loop count is unbounded (user-provided data), no batching
   - Suggestion: "Move query outside loop or use batch/join"

2. MISSING PAGINATION:
   - Find endpoints returning lists: return [], map(), filter(), findAll()
   - Check for pagination parameters: limit, offset, page, cursor, take, skip
   - FLAG as HIGH if: dataset could grow + no max result size enforced
   - Suggestion: "Add limit/offset parameters and LIMIT clause"

3. UNBOUNDED OPERATIONS:
   - Recursion without depth limit
   - Operations on unbounded user input (loops over user arrays, regex without timeout)
   - FLAG as MEDIUM if: no max size enforced or no timeout/deadline

4. SYNC I/O IN HOT PATH:
   - fs.readFileSync, sync.* methods in HTTP handlers/event-loop contexts
   - FLAG as HIGH if: in request handler with no async alternative

5. INEFFICIENT DATA STRUCTURES:
   - Array.includes() or Array.find() inside loops (O(n²))
   - FLAG as MEDIUM if: loop over >10 items or called multiple times per request
   - Suggestion: "Convert to Set/Map for O(1) lookups"

Report format:
  [HIGH] N+1 query — {file}:{line}: forEach loop with {Model.find()}
    Impact: N database queries for N items
    Suggestion: Use batch query with $in/IN clause

MCP SECURITY SCAN (before SECURITY HOT PATH REVIEW):
  If semgrep MCP server is available and tools.mode is not heuristic-only:
  1. Call semgrep security_check on all changed files
  2. Map severity:
     - semgrep error → CRITICAL
     - semgrep warning → HIGH
     - semgrep info → MEDIUM
  3. SAST findings bypass confidence filtering — always shown regardless of threshold
  4. Evidence label: [PROVEN] (tool output)
  5. Add findings to the issues list before Step 4 filtering
  If semgrep MCP unavailable:
     Fall back to OWASP pattern-matching in SECURITY HOT PATH REVIEW → [HEURISTIC]

SECURITY HOT PATH REVIEW (for files flagged CRITICAL/HIGH in diff fingerprint):

For any file with security sensitivity CRITICAL or HIGH:

1. TRACE all call chains:
   a. Read the changed function/method
   b. Grep for all usages of the function across the codebase
   c. For each usage, determine if it's an entry point:
      - HTTP handler → check if auth middleware applied
      - Background job → check if inputs validated
      - Library function → check if caller sanitizes inputs

2. CHECK security boundaries:
   - UNAUTHENTICATED code → must have rate limiting
   - AUTHENTICATED code → must verify user owns resource (authorization)
   - ADMIN code → must verify admin role
   - INPUT handling → must validate/sanitize
   - OUTPUT handling → must escape/redact sensitive data

3. VERIFY tests cover security boundaries:
   - Find test files for each entry point
   - Check for tests covering: unauthorized access, boundary violations,
     input validation, error handling (no stack traces leaked)

4. FLAG severity:
   CRITICAL: Security bug reachable from unauthenticated input
             Missing authorization check on privileged operation
             Sensitive data leaked in error messages/logs
   HIGH:     Security boundary untested
             Input validation missing
             Error handling exposes system details

IMPORTANT: Security findings ALWAYS bypass confidence filtering.
Report them regardless of confidence threshold.

AI-CODE DETECTION (apply to all files):
- Hallucinated APIs: verify function calls exist in dependencies
- Plausible but wrong: compare against project's existing usage of same library
- Over-engineering: abstractions used only once, premature generalization
- Copy-paste drift: similar blocks with subtle inconsistencies
- Missing integration: new code not wired into routing/DI/config
- Stale patterns: using deprecated APIs when project has migrated
- Incomplete error paths: generic catch blocks without specific handling
```

**Subagent split strategy:**

- If all files are same domain: single review subagent
- If backend + frontend: 2 parallel subagents
- If >20 changed files: split into groups of ~10 per subagent (max 3 parallel)

### Step 3: Intent Validation (IDD + BDD)

> **Method disclaimer:** Intent validation has two layers — **mechanical** (provable by tools) and **semantic** (Claude's judgment). The review clearly labels which is which. Mechanical checks (test exists, test passes, code grep) are reliable. Semantic checks (assertion quality, problem-solution alignment) are Claude's best-effort analysis — they catch obvious problems but cannot guarantee correctness. No amount of reading code replaces running it.

If `.temper/specs/{feature}/intent.md` exists, validate at TWO levels:

**BDD Level (mechanical):**

- Each scenario in intent.md → has a corresponding test → test passes
- Report as checklist in review

**IDD Level (structured validation):**

- Read the Intent section (problem, success criteria, constraints)
- Each success criterion has a `Validate:` field specifying how to check it:

| Validate Type | How to Check | Result |
|---------------|-------------|--------|
| `scenario` | Linked scenario's test passes | Mechanical — ✅/❌ |
| `code` | Grep for specified code/endpoint/config | Mechanical — ✅/❌ |
| `metric` | Cannot verify pre-deploy | Deferred — 📊 "Post-deploy monitoring required" |
| `manual` | Requires human judgment | Flagged — 🔍 "Manual check needed" |

- For each success criterion, execute its validation method:
  - ✅ Met: validation method confirms (scenario passes, code exists)
  - ❌ Not met: validation method fails (scenario fails, code missing)
  - 📊 Deferred: metric-based criterion, requires post-deploy measurement
  - 🔍 Manual: qualitative criterion, flagged for human review
- For each constraint: was it respected?
- Overall: "Intent satisfied" / "Intent partially satisfied — gaps: X, Y" / "Intent not satisfied"
- Count: "{N} mechanical, {N} deferred, {N} manual" — higher mechanical ratio = higher confidence

If no intent.md: fall back to checking linked issue (Jira/GitHub) as before.

### Step 3a: Semantic Test Validation (if intent.md exists)

> **Method disclaimer:** Reading test code and judging assertion quality is Claude's semantic analysis, not mechanical proof. A STRONG label means Claude believes the assertions cover the Then clause — but Claude cannot execute the test with a mutated implementation to prove it would fail. Use STRONG/WEAK/TRIVIAL as directional guidance, not guarantees.

After the mechanical BDD/IDD check in Step 3, validate that tests actually prove what they claim.

**Part 1: MECHANICAL checks (provable via tools):**

```
For each scenario with a passing test, run these checks that DON'T require judgment:

0. LOCATE the test file for each scenario:
   a. Check intent.md's Scenario Coverage Checklist for test name mapping
   b. Grep test files for the scenario name or Gherkin annotations (e.g., @scenario-name)
   c. If not found → flag as "test not locatable" and skip to next scenario

1. ASSERTION COUNT CHECK:
   a. Read the test function body
   b. Count assertion statements (assert*, expect*, should*, assertEquals, etc.)
   c. If ZERO assertions → TRIVIAL (mechanically proven — no judgment needed)
   d. If assertions exist → proceed to Part 2

2. ASSERTION TARGET CHECK (mechanical):
   a. Extract the variable/value being asserted from each assertion
   b. Extract the Then clause expected values from Gherkin
   c. Check: does ANY asserted variable name appear in the Then clause?
      - Then says "response.status equals 400" → grep test for "status" and "400"
      - Then says "error message contains 'invalid'" → grep test for "error" or "invalid"
   d. If NO assertion variable matches any Then clause keyword → WEAK (mechanical mismatch)
   e. If at least one assertion targets a Then clause keyword → proceed to Part 2
```

**Part 2: SEMANTIC checks (Claude's best-effort judgment):**

```
For scenarios that passed Part 1 mechanical checks:

3. Verify structural alignment with Gherkin:
   - Given → test sets up preconditions (fixtures, mocks, data)
   - When → test invokes the action under test
   - Then → test asserts the expected outcomes
4. Check assertion depth (judgment-based):
   - Flag incomplete assertions: Then says "response contains token" but test only asserts status code
   - Flag catch-all assertions: assert response != null without checking specific fields
   - Accept indirect assertions (helper methods, custom matchers) if they semantically cover the Then clause
   - If unsure whether an assertion covers a Then clause, do NOT flag
5. Report per-scenario:
   ✅ Scenario: "User logs in" — structurally aligned (Given/When/Then mapped)
   ⚠️ Scenario: "Rate limiting" — trivial assertion detected (assertTrue(true))
   ⚠️ Scenario: "Token returned" — incomplete: Then expects "token field" but test only asserts status 200
```

**Assertion quality labels:**
- STRONG — test sets up Given, invokes When, asserts Then with meaningful, specific assertions
- WEAK — test has incomplete assertions (Then expects "token" but only asserts status code); flagged as MEDIUM issue. Accept indirect assertions (helper methods, custom matchers) if they semantically cover the Then clause. If unsure whether an assertion covers a Then clause, do NOT flag.
- TRIVIAL — test has assertions that always pass (assertTrue(true), no assertions); flagged as LOW issue

These labels feed into the INTENT VERDICT evidence count: STRONG scenarios count toward the numerator, TRIVIAL scenarios do not, WEAK count as half.

**This step is additive** — existing mechanical checks still run first. Only runs when intent.md exists (backward compatible). Test body reading happens in the main review context, which already has access to changed files.

### Step 3b: Problem Statement Traceback (if intent.md exists)

> **Method disclaimer:** This step is entirely semantic — Claude compares the Problem statement against implementation code and judges whether they match. This catches obvious mismatches (building "password change" when the problem says "password reset") but cannot detect subtle functional gaps. No substitute for acceptance testing.

After validating individual scenarios, step back and assess the BIG picture:

```
1. Re-read the Problem: field from intent.md
2. Read the implementation code (changed files)
3. Ask: "Does this implementation actually solve the stated problem?"
4. Check for implementation drift:
   - Problem says "password reset" but code implements "password change" → drift detected
   - Problem says "caching" but code implements "prefetching" → partial match (different strategies)
   - Problem says "multi-user" but code handles single user → gap detected

5. Report:
   ✅ Intent satisfied — implementation addresses: {list of problem aspects covered}
   ⚠️ Intent partially satisfied — gaps: {list of uncovered aspects}
   ❌ Intent not satisfied — implementation doesn't address the stated problem

6. This produces the SEMANTIC intent verdict (distinct from Step 3's mechanical verdict)
```

**Verdict reconciliation:** When both Step 3 (mechanical) and Step 3b (semantic) produce verdicts, use the most conservative:
- If only one verdict is available, use that verdict directly
- If both are available: any "Not satisfied" → final verdict is "Not satisfied"; all "Satisfied" → "Satisfied"; otherwise → "Partially satisfied"
The INTENT VERDICT in the summary always reflects this reconciled verdict.

**This is the "semantic bridge"** — it requires understanding the relationship between problem and solution. When the review runs as a subagent, it has access to changed files, so it can read them.

### Step 3c: Decision Point Coverage (if intent.md exists)

Check whether the code's decision points have corresponding scenarios:

```
1. Scan changed files for decision points:
   - if/else branches (especially in business logic)
   - try/catch blocks with different error types
   - switch/case statements
   - Early returns with different outcomes
   - Error response variations

   EXCLUDE (do not flag):
   - Input validation guards (null/undefined checks)
   - Logging branches (if (logger.isDebugEnabled()))
   - Single-line early returns with no business logic
   - Standard framework patterns (auth middleware redirects, etc.)

   FOCUS ON:
   - Business logic conditionals (different user types, states, outcomes)
   - Multi-branch error handling (different error types → different responses)
   - Branches that produce different user-visible outcomes

2. For each decision point:
   - Does a scenario in intent.md cover this branch?
   - If no scenario → flag as potential gap

3. Report:
   ✅ All decision points covered by scenarios
   ⚠️ Uncovered decision points:
     - auth.ts:42 — branch for "email not verified" → no matching scenario
     - payment.ts:89 — catch StripeCardError → no matching scenario

4. Severity: LOW (informational) — the developer decides whether to add scenarios
```

This catches missing scenarios that the plan phase didn't anticipate. Only scans changed files (not entire codebase) to keep scope reasonable. Low severity by default — it's a suggestion, not a blocker.

### Step 3d: Live Mutation Spot-Check (if tests exist)

> **This is the ONLY step that actually PROVES tests catch bugs.** All other validation steps read code and form opinions. This step modifies code, runs tests, and checks the result. It's limited to 2-3 spot-checks (not full mutation testing) to keep review fast.

**Purpose:** Prove that at least some tests actually fail when the implementation breaks.

**When to run:** Only if Level 2 (unit tests) passed. Skip if no tests exist.

**How (concrete, executable steps):**

```
For each CRITICAL or HIGH security-sensitivity file that has tests (max 3 files):

1. PICK one assertion in the test file to spot-check:
   - Prefer: assertions on business logic (not framework plumbing)
   - Prefer: assertions that the STRONG/WEAK analysis flagged as uncertain

2. RUN the test once to confirm it passes (baseline):
   {test command for this specific test file}
   → Must PASS. If fails, there's already a bug — report it and stop.

3. MUTATE the implementation (one line only):
   Pick the simplest mutation that should break the tested behavior:
   - Change a return value: return true → return false
   - Change a comparison: if (amount > 0) → if (amount > 100)
   - Remove a required side effect: delete the database insert line
   - Change an error code: throw new Error("not found") → throw new Error("server error")
   Write the mutation to disk.

4. RUN the test again:
   {same test command}
   → If test FAILS → ✅ MUTATION CAUGHT — restore implementation, mark test as PROVEN
   → If test PASSES → ❌ MUTATION MISSED — restore implementation, flag test as UNVERIFIED

5. RESTORE the original implementation immediately (no matter what):
   git checkout -- {mutated file}
   Or: manually revert the single changed line

6. REPORT:
   ✅ PasswordResetTest.test_successful_reset — PROVEN
      Mutation: changed reset token expiry from 15min to 0min
      Test failed as expected — assertion catches this mutation
   ❌ RefundTest.test_process_refund — UNVERIFIED
      Mutation: changed authorization check from userId === owner to userId !== owner
      Test still passed — test does not verify authorization boundary
   ⏭️  Skipped (no test file found for AuthService.generateToken)
```

**Gate behavior:**
- UNVERIFIED on a security-critical function → CRITICAL issue
- UNVERIFIED on a regular function → HIGH issue (suggestion to strengthen test)
- Max 3 spot-checks per review (keeps review under 2 minutes extra)

**Important constraints:**
- ALWAYS restore the original code after mutation — never leave broken code on disk
- Only mutate CHANGED files (not entire codebase)
- If the test command isn't runnable (missing deps, env) → SKIP with note
- This is a SAMPLE, not exhaustive — it proves specific assertions work, not all of them
```

### Step 3.5: Cross-File Pattern Consistency Check

Detect when a changed file introduces a pattern that contradicts established patterns in similar files. This prevents "pattern drift" where codebases slowly accumulate inconsistent approaches.

**Pattern extraction (from changed files):**

```
For each changed file, extract key patterns:

1. ERROR HANDLING PATTERNS:
   - How are errors caught? (try/catch, if err, .catch, Result<> types)
   - How are errors raised? (throw, return error, reject, Error())
   - How are errors logged? (logger.error, console.error, log.error)

2. API RESPONSE PATTERNS:
   - Response structure (e.g., { data, error, meta })
   - Status code usage (200 vs 201, 400 vs 422)
   - Error response format (e.g., { code, message, details })

3. VALIDATION PATTERNS:
   - Input validation approach (schema library, manual checks, class validators)
   - Validation error format

4. ASYNC PATTERNS:
   - Promise handling (async/await, .then(), callbacks)
   - Error propagation in async contexts
```

**Consistency check:**

```
For each extracted pattern:
  1. Grep for the same pattern in OTHER files of the same type:
     - Changed file is a service? → grep src/services/
     - Changed file is a controller? → grep src/controllers/
     - Changed file is a test? → grep tests/
     - No same-type files? → skip (no comparison baseline)

  2. Compare the pattern:
     - Is the new pattern CONSISTENT with existing files?
     - Or does it introduce a NEW pattern that differs?

  3. If NEW pattern detected:
     a. Check intent.md and tasks.md — is this an intentional improvement?
     b. Or is this INCONSISTENT drift? (same concept, different approach)

  4. Flag inconsistencies:
     - Severity: MEDIUM (not blocking, but should be intentional)
     - Confidence: 0.6 (lower threshold — pattern matching is heuristic)
     - Description: "Pattern drift: {changed_file} uses {new_pattern}
       but {other_files} use {established_pattern}"
     - Suggestion: "Align with established pattern OR document why new
       pattern is better in intent.md"
```

**Example detection:**

```
Changed file: src/services/PaymentService.ts
  - Uses try/catch for error handling
  - Returns { success, data, error } objects

Existing: src/services/UserService.ts, src/services/OrderService.ts
  - Use Result<Ok, Err> type for error handling
  - Never use try/catch at service layer

FINDING: [MEDIUM] PaymentService introduces try/catch error handling
         but other services use Result<> types.
         Suggestion: Consider aligning for consistency.
```

**State update:** Extends `.temper/review-memory.json` with a `patterns` section:

```json
{
  "patterns": {
    "error_handling": {
      "dominant_pattern": "Result<Ok, Err>",
      "dominant_count": 8,
      "exceptions": [
        {
          "file": "src/services/PaymentService.ts",
          "pattern": "try/catch",
          "first_seen": "{date}",
          "intentional": false
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

After 3+ dismissals of same pattern type → auto-suppress consistency warnings for that pattern.

### Step 3.6: API Contract Validation

Detect API contract changes and verify consumers are updated. Catches breaking changes before they reach staging/production.

**Only runs when changed files include API boundary files:**

```
Trigger detection — run Step 3.6 if ANY changed file matches:
- src/controllers/**, src/routes/**, api/**
- Files ending in: *Controller.*, *Routes.*, *Dto.*, *Request.*, *Response.*
- Files in types/ or interfaces/ that export shared types
- OpenAPI/Swagger spec files
- GraphQL schema files (.graphql, .gql)
```

**Contract change analysis:**

```
1. EXTRACT the old contract (from git diff — removals):
   - Old endpoint path and HTTP method
   - Old request structure (fields, types, required/optional)
   - Old response structure (fields, types)
   - Old error codes

2. EXTRACT the new contract (from current code):
   - New endpoint path and HTTP method
   - New request structure
   - New response structure
   - New error codes

3. CLASSIFY change type:
   - ADDITIVE: New field, new endpoint, new optional parameter → LOW risk
   - MODIFIED: Field type changed, required → optional → HIGH risk
   - BREAKING: Required field removed, endpoint renamed,
     type changed incompatibly → CRITICAL

4. FIND consumers:
   a. Grep test files: grep -r "{endpoint_path}" tests/ --include="*.ts|*.js|*.py|*.java"
   b. Grep frontend code (if monorepo): grep -r "fetch.*{endpoint}" frontend/
   c. Grep for DTO/type imports: grep -r "import.*{TypeName}" --include="*.ts|*.js"
   d. Check for webhook/event subscribers: grep -r "{event_name}" src/

5. VERIFY consumers are updated:
   - For BREAKING changes: ALL consumers must be updated → BLOCK if any aren't
   - For MODIFIED changes: consumers handling old format must be updated → WARN
   - For ADDITIVE changes: consumers should be backward compatible → INFO
```

**Report format:**

```
CONTRACT CHANGES:
  ✅ GET /api/users — ADDITIVE (new field: emailVerified)
    Consumers: 3 test files, 1 frontend component
    All consumers backward compatible ✅

  ❌ POST /api/auth/login — BREAKING (response.token removed,
                                    response.access_token added)
    Consumers: 2 test files, 1 frontend component
    Tests updated ✅, Frontend NOT updated ❌
    BLOCKING: Frontend will break on deploy

  ⚠️ PaymentRequest.amount type changed (number → string)
    BREAKING type change but stringified in handler
    Risk: Runtime error if non-numeric string passed
    Suggestion: Keep as number or add runtime validation

CONTRACT VERDICT:
  {N} contract changes detected
  {N} breaking with unverified consumers → BLOCK
  {N} high-risk type changes → WARN
```

**Integration with review findings:**
- CRITICAL contract findings → added to CRITICAL issues count, bypass confidence filter
- HIGH contract findings → added to HIGH issues count
- All findings include: file, line, change type, affected consumers, suggested fix

**If a Jira ticket or GitHub issue was linked (legacy mode):**

```
1. Re-read the original issue/ticket requirements
2. For each requirement, check if the implementation addresses it:
   - ✅ Requirement met
   - ⚠️ Partially met (explain what's missing)
   - ❌ Not addressed
3. Check edge cases mentioned in the issue/ticket comments
4. Flag any requirements that were not implemented
```

### Step 4: Apply Confidence Filtering

Combine results from all subagents. For each finding:

```
ORDERING: Pack rules (step 3) override confidence filtering (step 1). A BLOCK pack rule
finding is ALWAYS shown, even if confidence is below threshold.

1. Check confidence score against threshold (default 0.7)
   - Below threshold → DISCARD entirely (not shown, not counted in metrics, not stored in memory)
   - Above threshold → include in report

2. Check review memory (.temper/review-memory.json)
   - Finding pattern dismissed 5+ times → SUPPRESS
   - Finding pattern dismissed 3-4 times → downgrade severity by 1 level
   - Finding pattern consistently accepted → keep as-is

3. Apply severity classification from pack rules
   - BLOCK rules → always CRITICAL regardless of confidence
   - WARN rules → HIGH or MEDIUM
   - SUGGEST rules → LOW
```

### Step 5: Nice Summary + Stage Gate

**If running as Agent subprocess:** Skip the AskUserQuestion gate. Return the review summary to the orchestrator. The orchestrator handles all gate decisions.

**If running standalone:** Show the summary and gate below.

After review completes, show a nice summary:

```

Use AskUserQuestion with these options:

```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "What next?"
  options:
    - label: "Fix all & continue to Check (Recommended)"
      description: "Apply ALL fixes (including low severity), clear context, proceed to check."
    - label: "Save for later"
      description: "Skip review fixes and save state."
  multiSelect: false
```

| Response | Action |
|----------|--------|
| **Fix all & continue to Check** (first option) | Apply ALL fixes (including low severity), clear context, proceed to check |
| **Save for later** (second option) | Skip fixes, save state |

**On Fix all & continue to Check (first option):**

```
1. If auto-fixable issues exist: apply fixes (see Step 6 for auto-fix loop details)
2. Save state to .temper/build-state.json
3. If running standalone:
   Signal:
   "✅ Continuing to CHECK...
    📂 Check needs no additional context — running validation pipeline."
   If running as Agent subprocess: The orchestrator handles context — return summary and stop.
4. If fixes applied: Re-run review (single pass, no subagents) — max 1 additional loop
   - If new issues found: show updated summary, ask again (this is the final loop)
   - If clean: proceed to /temper:check
5. If no fixes needed: proceed directly to /temper:check
```

**On Change (via "Other" free-text input):**

```
1. User types their change request in the "Other" field
2. Make the change
3. ⚠️ MANDATORY: Re-show AskUserQuestion with same options

GATE ENFORCEMENT: The user's change input is NOT approval to proceed.
Do NOT skip to check after making changes. The user MUST explicitly
select "Fix all & continue to Check" from the gate to proceed.
```

**On Save for later (second option):**

```
1. Skip review fixes
2. Save state to .temper/build-state.json:
   {
     "stage": "review_complete",
     "spec": "{feature-slug}",
     "spec_path": ".temper/specs/{feature-slug}",
     "original_args": "{from prior state}",
     "next_stage": "check",
     "artifacts": ["intent.md", "tasks.md"],
     "updated": "{ISO timestamp}"
   }
3. Report: "✅ Saved. Run /temper when ready to continue."
```

### Step 6: Auto-Fix (if enabled)

This step runs ONLY when invoked from Step 5's "Fix all" flow or when running standalone with auto-fix enabled. Do NOT run auto-fix independently.

```
1. For each HIGH+ issue marked as auto-fixable:
   - Apply the suggested fix
   - Run relevant tests to verify fix doesn't break anything

2. After all auto-fixes applied:
   - Re-run review (single pass, no subagents) to verify fixes
   - Total auto-fix loops across Step 5 + Step 6: max 2
   - If issues persist after max loops → show to user

3. Update review report with fix status
```

### Step 7.5: Context Output

After review completes and before updating metrics, write `review-context.json` to the spec directory:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "stage": "review",
  "timestamp": "{ISO timestamp}",
  "findings_summary": {
    "critical": {N},
    "high": {N},
    "medium": {N},
    "low": {N},
    "auto_fixed": {N}
  },
  "intent_verdict": "{satisfied|partial|not_met}",
  "security_hot_paths": ["list of flagged paths"],
  "contract_changes": ["list of contract changes"],
  "scenario_coverage": {
    "total": {N},
    "strong": {N},
    "weak": {N},
    "trivial": {N},
    "uncovered": {N}
  }
}
```

### Feedback Loop to Build

When `feedback.enabled: true` in temper.config and auto-fixable issues are found:

1. After applying fixes (Step 6), check if issues persist
2. If issues persist AND iteration < max-loops (default 2):
   - Write review-context.json with remaining issues
   - Signal orchestrator to loop back to Build
3. If issues persist AND iteration >= max-loops:
   - Stop and show remaining issues to user
   - Offer "Save for later" or "Manual fix"
4. Circuit breaker: same issue found in 2 consecutive loops → stop immediately

The feedback loop counter is tracked in `.temper/feedback-loops.json`.

### Step 7: Update Metrics

Append to `.temper/metrics.json`:

```json
{
  "reviews": {
    "total": "+1",
    "issues_found": "+{count}",
    "by_severity": { "critical": "+X", "high": "+Y", ... },
    "by_category": { "security": "+X", "performance": "+Y", ... },
    "auto_fixed": "+{count}",
    "confidence_avg": "{avg score of all findings}"
  }
}
```

### Step 8: Update Review Memory

```json
// .temper/review-memory.json
// For each finding that was shown to user, track their response in next session
{
  "patterns": {
    "{pattern-key}": {
      "total_shown": 14,
      "accepted": 12,
      "dismissed": 2,
      "last_seen": "2026-03-09",
      "auto_rule": false,
      "context_variants": {}
    }
  }
}
```

When a pattern reaches 3+ accepted: suggest auto-rule in `/temper:status`.
When a pattern reaches 5+ dismissed: auto-suppress.

### Context-Dependent Dismissals

Findings can be valid in general but invalid in specific contexts. Track per-context in review-memory.json `context_variants`.

**Context detection:**

| Context | Detection | Why Dismissed |
|---------|-----------|---------------|
| Config loader | Path contains `config/` or class has `Config` | Validated at startup |
| Test fixtures | Path contains `test/`, `spec/`, `__tests__/` | Controlled data |
| DTOs | Class has `DTO`, `Request`, `Response` | Framework-validated |
| Legacy | Listed in `.temper/legacy-modules.json` | Known exception |
| Generated | Header contains `@generated` | Not editable |

**Suppression rules:**

```
- Context-specific dismissal >= 3 times → SUPPRESS in that context only
- Context dismissals are ISOLATED: dismissed in auth ≠ dismissed in payments
- On dismissal: ask "Dismiss for this file only, or all {context} files?"
```

### Multi-Agent Severity Consensus

```
1. Same severity from all agents → use that severity
2. Mixed severities → use highest (conservative)
3. One agent finds CRITICAL and ALL other agents find NO issues on the same code → downgrade to HIGH (single-agent CRITICAL is unreliable)
4. Disagreement on category → use "quality" as default
```

### AI-Code Detection Checklist (reference for standalone review)

(Expanded version of the inline checklist in Step 2 — subagents use the inline version; this section is reference for standalone review runs.)

When reviewing code, actively check for these AI-specific failure patterns:

```
1. HALLUCINATED APIS:
   - For each method/function call, verify the function EXISTS in the project's dependencies
   - Check: Does the imported module actually export this function?
   - Red flag: function name looks plausible but isn't in the library's API docs
   - How to detect: grep for the function definition. If not found in project or node_modules/vendor → flag as HIGH

2. PLAUSIBLE BUT WRONG:
   - Code uses the correct library but wrong parameters, wrong order, or wrong context
   - Red flag: async function called without await, callback passed to promise-based API
   - How to detect: compare against library's actual API signature in node_modules/vendor
   - Fallback (subagent context without dependency access): compare against the project's existing usage patterns of the same library. If the new call differs from established patterns, flag as MEDIUM.

3. OVER-ENGINEERING:
   - Unnecessary abstractions (interface for single implementation, factory for single product)
   - Helper utilities used only once
   - Premature generalization (type parameters never varied, strategy pattern with one strategy)
   - How to detect: count usages. If abstraction used once → flag as LOW

4. COPY-PASTE DRIFT:
   - Similar code blocks with subtle inconsistencies
   - Red flag: two blocks that look identical except one variable name, but the logic differs
   - How to detect: look for duplicated patterns in changed files, compare variable names and logic

5. MISSING INTEGRATION:
   - New code exists but isn't wired into routing, DI container, event handlers, or config
   - Red flag: new service class never registered, new route never mounted
   - How to detect: grep for imports/usage of the new module in existing wiring files

6. STALE PATTERNS:
   - Using deprecated APIs when the project has already migrated to newer ones
   - Red flag: new code uses patterns that old code used before a migration
   - How to detect: compare new code patterns against recent code in same directory

7. INCOMPLETE ERROR PATHS:
   - Happy path works, error handling is placeholder or generic
   - Red flag: catch blocks that just log or rethrow without meaningful handling
   - How to detect: for each try/catch, check if the catch block does something specific to the error type
```

These checks integrate into the existing parallel review subagents (Step 2). Each subagent runs the checklist on the files in its domain. The checklist doesn't create new subagents — it enhances the prompts for existing ones. All flags follow existing severity rules: hallucinated APIs = HIGH, over-engineering = LOW, etc.

### Automatic Next Step

- If CRITICAL or HIGH issues remain after auto-fix → show report, ask user
- If all clean → auto-chain to `/temper:check`
- If called manually (not from /temper:build) → show report, ask user for next action
