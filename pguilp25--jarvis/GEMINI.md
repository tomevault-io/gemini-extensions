# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What JARVIS is

A multi-brain AI agent that coordinates many **free/weak** LLMs (NVIDIA NIM, OpenRouter, DeepInfra, Groq, Gemini) to approximate frontier-model quality at $0, slower. The bet: several models plan independently, critique, and merge, beating one weak model thinking alone. The hardest and most actively developed part is the **coding agent** — a 4-role pipeline (UNDERSTAND → PLAN → IMPLEMENT → REVIEW) whose target is to score well on SWE-bench / SWE-bench Pro with weak models.

## Parallel-instance coordination (READ FIRST — two Claude Code instances are active)

Two Claude Code instances work this repo **at the same time**. Stay in your lane; flag anything that crosses lanes **before** you touch it. Assume the other instance has unrelated edits in flight — never `git checkout`/revert/`stash` broadly, never "clean up" files you don't own, and `git pull`/rebase mindset: your working tree is shared.

- **Lane A — Coding agent** (the UNDERSTAND→PLAN→IMPLEMENT→REVIEW pipeline + its SWE-bench eval). Files: `core/native_tools.py`, `core/tool_call.py`, `core/tool_detector.py`, `core/prompts_v8.py`, `core/self_verify.py`, `core/structural_gate.py`, `core/remote_check.py`, `core/review_verify.py`, `core/verify_toolkit.py`, `core/plan_*.py`, `core/code_index.py`, `core/cli.py` (trace), `workflows/code.py`, `tools/`, `swe_bench.py` + `behavioral_audit/` (coding-agent eval/grading).
- **Lane B — Context system** (a NEW subsystem giving the MAIN PIPELINE better context; explicitly **NOT** the coding agent — used by the main pipeline, not the coder/planner/reviewer). Files: the new context-system module(s) + the main-pipeline hooks that gather/inject context. *(Lane B owner: list your files here.)*

**Shared / cross-cutting — touching these can impact the other lane → ANNOUNCE first (log line + commit note):**
`main.py`, `ui_main.py` and the top-level pipeline orchestration; `clients/` (the LLM clients both lanes call); shared config / env-key handling; `CLAUDE.md`; and — the one real seam — **the handoff where the main pipeline passes the task/context into the coding agent**. If Lane B changes *what context the coder/planner actually receives*, that DOES reach Lane A → flag it loudly (Lane A's whole doctrine is "verify the rendered artifact the model receives"; silently changing that artifact breaks it).

**Rules:**
1. Edit only your lane. Do NOT refactor, rename, move, or "fix" the other lane's files — if it looks wrong, leave it and flag it.
2. Before touching a SHARED file (or anything in the other lane), STOP and append a line to the **Cross-lane log** below (file · what · why). Prefer an ADDITIVE change (new function / new param with a default) over modifying a signature the other lane consumes.
3. If you change a shared signature / contract / data-shape, say so explicitly in the log AND the commit message.
4. Commit-message prefix: `[agent]` (Lane A) / `[ctx]` (Lane B), so the other can filter `git log`. Commit your own files; don't sweep the other's changes into your commit.
5. Run discipline: exactly ONE `swe_bench.py` run at a time (Lane A owns it); the grading PC (ngrok) is shared infra — don't launch work that competes with a run in flight.

**Cross-lane log** (append newest-first when you touch shared/cross-cutting):
- `CLAUDE.md` · [agent] added the REFLEX-vs-CoT doctrine bullet to the Engineering-doctrine Non-negotiables (Lane A prompt-engineering principle from the GW20l forensic). PURELY ADDITIVE (a new doctrine bullet — no code, no signature/contract change, does not touch Lane B). · WHY: a model-facing rule only BINDS as a conditional reflex when its trigger is surface-lexical + its check mechanical (S2 bound); inference-triggered / shallow-check / prerequisite-needing rules must be woven CoT (S1/S3 didn't bind) — codifying so future prompt work (both lanes' model-facing prompts, and every prompt-design subagent) picks the shape deliberately + doesn't bloat.
- `ui/index.html` + `ui/server.py` · [ctx] medium_chat ROUND-BY-ROUND UI revamp (Lane B). `run_turn` now takes an optional async `emit` callback that streams per-round events (`round_start` → `proposal` {role,name,thinking,tools} → `merge` {thinking,message,tools} → `tool` {tool,args,result} → `final`); loop now TERMINATES when a round runs no ACTION tool (its message is the answer); a proposer fallback RENAMES in place (`gpt-oss ·paid`), no new entity. `ui/server.py` broadcasts these as `mc_*` (mc_final renders the bubble; memory still persists). `ui/index.html` renders per-round collapsible blocks (each model + merger click-to-reveal thinking, the merger response, tools click-to-reveal full args/result), color-coded per role, and a guard at the top of `h()` DROPS the raw `thinking_*`/`status` stream while `mcLive[cvid]` is set (our blocks replace it). ADDITIVE — normal pipeline rendering untouched. · WHY: the user's requested transparent round-by-round chat UX.
- `main.py` · [ctx] wire the medium_chat backbone as an EXPERIMENTAL, OPT-IN chat mode (Lane B). PURELY ADDITIVE: a `MEDIUM_CHAT` flag (`--medium-chat` or `JARVIS_MEDIUM_CHAT=1`, default OFF) OR the per-message `!!medium_experimental` prefix routes the turn to `workflows.medium_chat.chat_once(session_dir, msg)` then `continue`s — the normal pipeline (`process_turn` + coding-agent apply/compress) is UNCHANGED when the flag is off. New helper `chat_once` added in `workflows/medium_chat.py` (additive; `_cli_say` refactored to call it). Session store at `~/.jarvis/medium_chat_session`. Does NOT touch the main-pipeline→coding-agent handoff. · WHY: let the user start chatting with the medium_chat backbone (Opus-4.8 evals ~9/10) without disturbing Lane A.
- `ui/server.py` · [ctx] same experimental medium_chat wiring for the WEB UI (Lane B). PURELY ADDITIVE: in `_on_message`, when `JARVIS_MEDIUM_CHAT=1` OR the message starts with `!!medium_experimental`, route the turn to `chat_once` (per-conversation store at `~/.jarvis/medium_chat_ui/<conv_id>`), send the response, and `memory.add(user/assistant)` so the UI history/sidebar stay in sync, then `return` — normal `process_turn` path is UNCHANGED when the flag is off. Launch: `JARVIS_MEDIUM_CHAT=1 python3 ui_main.py`. · WHY: chat with medium_chat from the web UI too.
- `clients/nvidia.py` · cap-hit signal for the coder (Lane A, ckpt-396) — ADDITIVE only: `call_nvidia_stream` got an optional `usage_out: dict|None=None` kwarg (default None → pure no-op for every existing caller; when passed, the fn copies the round's `usage` into it so the coder loop can detect a completion-token cap hit). No signature-break (new trailing kwarg with a default), no change to the request bytes or any existing call site. · WHY: the Go coder was silently truncating big edit-op JSON at the 8000-token cap (15/20 Go instances); the loop now reads completion_tokens to fire a "you were CUT OFF — emit the edit first" nudge. Does NOT touch the main-pipeline→coder handoff.
- `clients/nvidia.py` · runaway-generation fix-set (Lane A, deepseek-v4-flash ramble) — 3 touches, additive/value-only, request-byte-neutral except where noted: (1) `_max_thinking_payload` deepseek-v4 branch: `reasoning_effort` "xhigh"→`os.environ.get("JARVIS_REASONING_EFFORT","high")` (env-overridable; `thinking:{type:enabled}` kept for interleaved thinking). (2) `_apply_gptoss_pin`: the two `payload.pop("max_tokens",None)` (gpt-oss + deepseek-v4-flash) → CLAMP `payload["max_tokens"]=min(payload.get("max_tokens") or 16000, 16000)` — restores a 16k OUTPUT ceiling (the original pop solved a wrong-slug 402 billing issue, NOT a real no-cap need). (3) `_log_cached_tokens`: read `usage.completion_tokens`, append `/ completion_tokens={N}` (+`⚠RAMBLE` when ≥20k) to the cache log line and the round_trace record (read-only/additive). · WHY: deepseek-v4-flash burned ~30k reasoning tokens to no output on small-input planner/coder rounds (400-601s/round) under xhigh + no output cap. No signature/contract change; the clamp only LOWERS max output (never raises it).

**Current state:**
- *Lane A (coding agent):* mid-mission making REVIEW functional + safe — in-between-layer check grounding, a deterministic structural gate, diagnostic-handover to the repair loop, and remote check-execution on the PC. Score sits at the ~13/27 baseline (`behavioral_audit/shared27.json`); active lever = making REVIEW *convert* the fails it now catches. Detailed running state in `memory/MEMORY.md`.
- *Lane B (context system):* *(owner: summarize the goal + current state here.)*

## Engineering doctrine — VERIFY THE RENDERED ARTIFACT (read this before touching anything)

The reachable standard for this project is **not "zero bugs ever"** — it is **every catchable bug caught in the first pass, offline, before a live run.** The recurring failure mode, proven over and over in this repo's own history, is *editing a string and never looking at the whole thing the model actually receives*: dead code (the legacy `PLAN_COT_EXISTING`/`MERGE_PROMPT_TEMPLATE` strings silently overwritten by their `_V8` versions — edits to them are no-ops), stale prompt anchors, leaked protocol tokens, an unclosed `[think]` that swallowed a correct plan. Each was invisible at edit time and cost a 30–60 min live run to surface. **We do not work that way.** Spending more tokens, more thinking, and more verification up front is *always* correct here — it is far cheaper than a wrong assumption found after the tenth run. Token budget is not a constraint; rigor is the constraint.

**THE RULE: before any live run, render and read the FULL assembled artifact the model actually receives — end to end.** Not the source string — the assembled result: system prompt + tool schemas + user turn + injected files + the growing view + reject/nudge messages, exactly as the API sees it. If you changed a prompt, a tool description, a view renderer, or a reject message, you render it and you read all of it. A bug you could have seen in the rendered artifact must never reach a live run.

Non-negotiables:
- **Edits must land on the LIVE artifact.** The `_V8` constants in `core/prompts_v8.py` are what run; same-named legacy strings elsewhere are DEAD. After any prompt/format edit, render the assembled prompt and confirm your change is *in it* (use `behavioral_audit/render_prompt.py`).
- **Render across MANY cases, not one.** A prompt is correct only across the shapes it meets in production: small/large files, a view with holes, post-edit diffs, rejects, multi-file steps, empty-turn retries, create-file. Render a representative spread and read them.
- **Offline-first.** A live SWE run (30–60 min, partial logs) is the WRONG loop for finding mechanics/prompt bugs. Reproduce offline in seconds (`render_prompt.py`, `behavioral_audit/bridge.py`, `jarvis_emu.py`, trace replay). Live runs are for *measuring resolution*, not debugging.
- **Capture the whole story.** When a run fails, dump the COMPLETE trace (every prompt, tool result, reject) and audit ALL causes at once — never grep one symptom and ship one fix.
- **Adversarial review BEFORE commit, not after the run.** Spawn independent agents to attack new prompts/code. A 2-minute adversarial read beats a 40-minute run that finds the same bug. Use the tokens.
- **No dead code, no stale instructions, no contradictions.** A model-facing instruction that contradicts the live format silently degrades a weak model — treat prompt/format drift as a P0 bug, not cosmetic.
- **REFLEX vs CoT — choose the shape DELIBERATELY (every model-facing rule, every role).** A rule may be a REFLEX (conditional "IF `<trigger>` THEN `<act>`" in a reflex list) ONLY when BOTH: its trigger is *surface-lexical* (a verbatim quoted noun/symbol/keyword/error-string the weak model reliably sees — e.g. "the X **function**", `cannot use x (*T) as T`) AND its action is a *single local move with a mechanical/compile-level check*. Otherwise it MUST be a **CoT step** — an UNCONDITIONAL move woven into the model's emitted sequence, placed BEFORE the decision it governs — because a weak model (a) won't recognise an *inference-requiring* trigger ("is this a relation with two ends?"), (b) will satisfy a *shallow presence-check* without doing the work ("some step writes the field" ≠ "the reader receives it"), and (c) skips a *prerequisite* (a read) that a rule placed AFTER the decision assumes. PROOF (GW20l): S2 (noun→symbol-form: bind-able reflex) converted; S1 (relation-two-ends: inference trigger, and placed in the FACTS ledger which the plan writes AFTER its STEPs → a back-fill that can't drive scope) and S3 (named-output: shallow write-side check) did NOT — the fix is to make them woven pre-decision CoT + force the prerequisite read. COROLLARY — placement: a rule that governs a decision but sits AFTER it in the emitted format cannot drive it; move it before. COST DISCIPLINE — an always-on CoT step costs EVERY run: convert ONLY high-frequency classes; keep bind-able + low-frequency rules as light reflexes; DROP dead ones. Do NOT bloat — prefer sharpening/moving an existing rule over adding a new one, and keep the prompt ORGANISED (discrete, well-placed lines; no run-on walls the weak model reads-but-drops). This applies when authoring/auditing ANY role's prompt (draft, merger, coder, reviewer) — and every prompt-design subagent must be given this rule.

API keys are read from env vars (no config file): `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`/`OPENROUTER_API_KEYS` (comma-list, round-robined), `NVIDIA_API_KEY`, `DEEPINFRA_API_KEY`, `LIGHTNING_API_KEY`, `GROQ_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`/`GEMINI_API_KEYS`, `TAVILY_API_KEY`. A `venv/` exists (`venv/bin/python3`); the grading harness uses it explicitly.

## Architecture — the parts that span multiple files

**Two distinct coder paths share the same applier but speak different protocols.** This is the single most important thing to internalize before editing coder code:

- **Native (primary): `core/native_tools.py`** — `gpt-oss-120b` via structured **function calling** (`call_with_native_tools` loop, `_dispatch` to per-tool `_do_*` functions). Tools: read_file, edit_file, create_file, search_text, find_refs, find_callers, file_purpose, semantic_search, depends_on, run_code, finish.
- **Text protocol: `core/tool_call.py`** — fallback coders (qwen3-coder, glm-5.1) that don't do native function calling; they emit `[CODE:]`/`[edit]`/`[STOP]`/`[VIEW:]`/`[KEEP:]` bracket tags parsed from text. The **reviewer** also runs this protocol.

Both render file views and apply edits, but with **different gutter formats** — do not conflate them:
- Native view (`display_mode="prefix_ws"`): `LINENO ⇥INDENT|<real spaces>code` (the `⇥` marks the indent number). Edits: copy the view line verbatim for `old` (anchors on **both** line number AND content), write `new` as `INDENT|code` (the harness re-emits the leading spaces from the number).
- Text view (`display_mode="prefix"`/else): `LINENO:INDENT|code` (colon). Changing one coder's format must not touch the other's.

**The edit applier is shared.** Native `edit_file` and the text `[edit]` blocks both funnel through `workflows/code.py:_apply_extracted_code` (number-first, content-verified). Validation gates there: parse check (reject + revert on `SyntaxError`/`ValueError`) and an undefined-name/dangling-reference check (reject-and-revert — deleting a def while it's still called is blocked). `_expand_indent_lines` in `native_tools.py` turns the `INDENT|`/`LINENO ⇥INDENT|` forms back into real spaces.

**Provider routing: `clients/nvidia.py`.** `call_nvidia_tools` + `_route_provider` send the OpenAI-compatible request; `gpt-oss-120b` is pinned to DeepInfra@bf16 via OpenRouter's `provider` field. The coder fallback chain is `_CODER_CHAIN` in `workflows/code.py` (gpt-oss-120b native → qwen3-coder text → mistral/medium native → gpt-oss-nim native → glm-5.1 text); **gpt-oss-nim must stay last** (it hangs ~5 min then 504s instead of failing fast).

**Empty-turn handling (a recurring real failure mode).** DeepInfra intermittently returns `finish_reason=stop` with no structured `tool_calls` even under `tool_choice="required"` — it leaves the tool call as TEXT in the harmony reasoning channel. The native loop handles this in two layers: **salvage** (`_salvage_inline_tool_call` parses the leaked JSON, infers the tool, synthesizes the call — no extra API call) then a **retry** with a "emit a structured tool call" nudge. `tool_choice="required"` is *not* reliably enforced by all providers; some providers (Google Vertex) don't expose tools at all.

**Stability invariant:** `_dispatch(name, args, ctx)` must never raise for any tool × any args — a malformed/wrong-typed call returns a clean `✗` string the coder reacts to. `tests_audit/test_native_tools_fuzz.py` enforces this with generated cases; tool entry points coerce/validate via `_str_or_err`.

**Prompts: `core/prompts_v8.py`.** `IMPLEMENT_NATIVE_PROMPT_V8` (≈ lines 1902–1936) is the native coder's system prompt; `REVIEW_*`/`SELF_CHECK_*` are the reviewer's (text protocol). The native coder's full system prompt is `IMPLEMENT_NATIVE_PROMPT` plus an always-on indent-format block appended in `native_tools.py`. Keep model-facing instructions (schema descriptions, prompt prose, reject messages) consistent with the live edit format — stale instructions silently confuse weak coders.

**Code indexing & sandbox.** `tools/code_index.py` builds 3 maps (purpose / detailed / symbol) used by find_refs/file_purpose/semantic_search; `tools/codebase.py` renders views and runs searches (ripgrep); `tools/sandbox.py` is a read-only/no-network bwrap sandbox where edits land and `run_code` executes.

## Working in this repo (project conventions)

- **SWE-bench runs:** exactly one at a time; long-running. Kill background runs **by PID** — never `pkill`/`pgrep -f` a pattern that matches the current shell, and never `kill -- -PID` (both exit 144).
- **Never reuse an existing `preds_*.jsonl` filename** for a new run — the grader can read stale rows before `swe_bench.py` truncates it, poisoning the cumulative score. Use a fresh name; graded count must never exceed the preds line count.
- **Commit messages via `-F <file>`**, not `-m "..."` — backticks and `!` in `-m` get shell-command-substituted/expanded and mangle the message.
- `tests_audit/test_native_tools.py` should be fully green (88/88 as of ckpt-159). The three formerly-failing prompt-drift tests (`test_native_prompt_tools_match_schema`, `test_coder_prompts_ground_on_spec_literals`, `test_native_prompt_has_thinking_toolkit_reflexes`) were fixed in ckpt-159 — one was a false-failing regex; two needed dropped prompt anchors restored. A NEW failure in this suite is a real regression; don't dismiss it as pre-existing.
- A separate persistent memory lives under `memory/MEMORY.md` (mission state, hard-won gotchas) — distinct from this file.



to develop this, you need to be verry carfull, all the bug that you put will do delay, and make us do bad assuption, you need to test all your code with a lot of care, you can do test code to test for bug and spawn suagent to directly probe the code for bug and a lot of other technic. when you code use the mesur twice cut once technic, think more, to be shure you don't do misstake, and take the best decision. taking more time when coding will save us a lot of time at debugging and testing. 

if you see i am wrong or i did bad assumtion, call it out, if you see batter alternative, call it out, if you have doupt, ask me question, i don't just want you to always agree with me, it is better that you call the wrong assuption and wrong decision then to let them trough. don't be afraid to call me when you think i am wrong.
