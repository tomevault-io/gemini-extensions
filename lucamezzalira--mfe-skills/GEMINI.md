## mfe-boundary-review

> Reviews and generates micro-frontend code against eight boundary rules from Building Micro-Frontends (O'Reilly), plus governance extensions for feature-flag scope, edge strategy, SSR ownership, and boundary fitness functions. Use when a user says "review my shell code", "is this a boundary violation?", "generate a Module Federation shell", "how do I mount this MFE?", "review my micro-frontend architecture", "set up event communication between MFEs", "create a new micro-frontend", "how should we use edge with MFEs?", "where should feature flags live?", or "how do I enforce boundaries in a monorepo?". Loads automatically when the user pastes shell integration code, Module Federation config, Single SPA registration, or Native Federation routes. Does not activate for component-level code within a single deployed unit, or for generic React, Vue, or Angular questions with no cross-team deployment angle.


# MFE boundary health

Reviews and generates micro-frontend code against the eight boundary rules from *Building Micro-Frontends* (O'Reilly). All rules are tool-agnostic. Full rule definitions, violation signals, and code-checkable patterns are in `references/rules.md` — load it when you need the detail for a specific rule.

**On every activation, apply this summary table directly — no file load needed:**

| Rule | What to check in code | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| 1 — Business subdomain | Name reflects a business capability, not a UI element | High |
| 2 — Minimal API surface | Fewer than 5 props; no full domain objects passed | Critical |
| 3 — Hide implementation details | No direct imports from another MFE's internals | Critical |
| 4 — Events not shared state | No shared store; shell handles `shell:*` only; domain events peer-to-peer or URL | Critical |
| 5 — Independent deployment | No versioned URLs in shell config; no build-time MFE imports; no CI pipeline coupling | High |
| 6 — Isolate failure | Every remote mount has a fallback in the shell | High |
| 7 — Coarse-grained | Nesting depth > 1 (MFE inside MFE); more than 3 MFEs per view | High |
| 8 — Single-team ownership | One team in CODEOWNERS; no cross-team sign-off on internals | High |

For full rule definitions and violation signals: load `references/rules-core.md`.
For framework-specific patterns (MF v2, Angular/Native Federation, Single SPA): load `references/rules-toolchain.md`.
For URL routing ownership (shell first segment, MFE deeper paths): load `references/routing-ownership.md`.
For fix patterns and step-by-step remediation: load `references/remediation.md` when the user asks how to fix a violation or requests a migration plan.

## Cold start: new project

If no boundaries exist yet, ask about the highest-priority unknown first — one question per turn. Do not generate implementation code until each check is resolved.

**Check 1 — Team ownership**
Ask: "Which team will own this micro-frontend end-to-end — design, development, deployment, and operations?"
**If unresolved:** do not generate implementation code. Ask the user to install the **micro-frontend-canvas** skill and complete a canvas iteration (see https://github.com/lucamezzalira/mfe-canvas).

**Check 2 — Domain identification**
Ask: "What business capability does this represent? What user journey step does it enable?"
**If unclear:** recommend the **micro-frontend-canvas** skill before implementation. Do not generate a full Canvas worksheet from this skill. A boundary without a named domain is not ready for code.

**Check 3 — Decisions framework**
Ask: "Is this a vertical or horizontal split, and how will it be composed — client-side or server-side?"
**If unresolved:** generate a skeleton with a placeholder composition comment and note which decision is still needed.

Once all three are confirmed, apply the rules as design constraints from the first line of code — retrofitting is significantly more expensive than designing correctly upfront.

## Code generation defaults

When generating any MFE code, apply these defaults without being asked. Examples are shown per toolchain — apply the pattern that matches the user's stack.

**URL routing — shell first segment only; MFE owns depth below (Rule 7):**

- **Shell**: load **only** first-level paths from a runtime manifest (`routes.json` + `remotes.json`) so adding/removing an MFE does not require shell code changes or redeploy for MFE-internal pages
- **MFE**: hardcoded internal routes are expected (`/product/:id` under `/catalog`); new sub-pages are MFE-only deploys
- **Navigation implementation**: flexible (`<a>`, `<Link>`, `navigate()`, etc.) — enforce URL depth ownership, not a specific router API
- **Cross-area navigation**: change the first URL segment; deeper segments stay inside the owning MFE

```tsx
// ✓ Shell — manifest-driven first segment (wildcard → remote)
// routes.json: { "path": "/catalog/*", "scope": "catalog_mfe", "module": "./CatalogApp" }
routes.map((r) => <Route key={r.scope} path={r.path} element={<RemoteMount ... />} />)

// ✓ Catalog MFE — hardcoded routes under basename (no shell change when adding pages)
<BrowserRouter basename="/catalog">
  <Routes>
    <Route path="/product/:productId" element={<ProductDetail />} />
  </Routes>
</BrowserRouter>

// ✗ Shell — domain sub-route
<Route path="/catalog/product/:productId" element={...} />
```

**Shell platform events — allowed; domain events in shell — not (Rules 4, 7):**

- Shell **may** handle platform/chrome events: alerts, toasts, modals, global loading chrome
- Shell **must not** subscribe to domain namespaces (`catalog:*`, `checkout:*`, `cart:*`)
- MFEs emit `shell:alert`, `shell:modal:open`, etc.; horizontal peers may use domain events MFE-to-MFE, not via shell handlers

```javascript
// ✓ MFE → shell chrome
platformBus.emit('shell:alert', { message: 'Saved', variant: 'success' })

// ✗ Shell listens to business events
platformBus.on('catalog:productSelected', handler)
```

Load `references/routing-ownership.md` for full patterns.

**Shell mounting — always include a fallback in the shell, not inside the micro-frontend (Rule 6):**

```jsx
{/* React / Module Federation */}
<ErrorBoundary fallback={<CheckoutFallback />}>
  <CheckoutMicrofrontend userId={userId} cartId={cartId} />
</ErrorBoundary>
```

```typescript
// Angular / Native Federation — shell route with fallback on load failure
{
  path: 'checkout',
  loadComponent: () =>
    loadRemoteModule('checkout', './CheckoutComponent')
      .then(m => m.CheckoutComponent)
      .catch(() => CheckoutFallbackComponent)  // fallback defined in shell
}
```

```javascript
// Single SPA — catch mount errors at the shell level
const parcel = mountRootParcel(checkoutConfig, { domElement })
parcel.mountPromise.catch(() => renderCheckoutFallback())
```

**Props — pass identifiers, not domain objects (Rule 2):**

```jsx
{/* React — identifiers only */}
<CheckoutMicrofrontend userId={userId} cartId={cartId} />
{/* ✗ Never: user={fullUserObject} cart={fullCartObject} */}
```

```typescript
// Angular — route param carries the identifier; remote reads ActivatedRoute itself
// ✓ { path: 'checkout/:cartId', loadComponent: () => loadRemoteModule(...) }
// ✗ resolve: { cart: CartResolver, user: UserResolver } — container owns context
```

```javascript
// Single SPA — customProps with identifiers only
registerApplication({
  name: 'checkout',
  app: () => import('checkout/main'),
  activeWhen: '/checkout',
  customProps: { userId, cartId }  // ✓ identifiers only
})
```

**Same-page communication (horizontal split) — event emitter between peers, never shared state (Rule 4):**

```javascript
// MFE-to-MFE on the same page — domain events OK between peers, not in shell
eventBus.emit('catalog:filterChanged', { category: 'audio' })

// ✗ Never: import { checkoutStore } from '@org/checkout-mfe/store'
```

**Shell platform bus — chrome only (Rules 4, 7):**

```javascript
// ✓ MFE requests shell-owned UI
platformBus.emit('shell:modal:open', { id: 'confirm', title: 'Continue?' })

// ✗ Shell must not own domain reactions
platformBus.on('checkout:completed', ({ orderId }) => { ... })
```

**Cross-area navigation and data — first segment switches MFE; depth stays in MFE (Rules 4, 7):**

```javascript
// ✓ Any style that changes the first segment — implementation is flexible
navigate('/catalog')
// <Link to="/catalog"> or <a href="/catalog">

// ✓ Deeper path owned by catalog MFE — no shell redeploy when this route is added
navigate(`/catalog/product/${productId}`)

// ✓ Store a token; receiving MFE retrieves it independently
sessionStorage.setItem('auth_token', token)

// ✗ window.history.pushState({ user: fullUserObject }, '', '/catalog')
```

## Boundary health check

Quick checklist for validity questions — no file load needed.

1. API surface minimal — fewer than 5 props to the container?
2. Context-aware — retrieves its own data given minimal input?
3. Less extensible than a component — not reused across domains?
4. Coarse-grained — not fine enough to require constant coordination?
5. Deploys without coordinating with other teams?
6. Graceful fallback if it fails to load?
7. Single team owns it end-to-end?

If any answer is no, the boundary needs to be revisited before implementation begins.

---

## Reviewing existing code

Scan in this order — most impactful violations first:

1. **Rule 3** — any import where the source path is another MFE's internal module. One cross-boundary import can invalidate independent deployment for the entire boundary. Load `references/rules-core.md` for full patterns.
2. **Rule 2** — count props at the mount site. Flag if more than 5, or if any prop is a full domain object.
3. **Rule 4** — shared state imports, global store references, callbacks as the primary coordination mechanism.
4. **Rule 6** — every remote mount point in the shell. If no fallback is present, flag it.
5. **Rule 7** — count MFEs in the view (flag above 3, hard violation above 5); check nesting depth (any MFE rendered inside another MFE is a violation regardless of count); check whether the container is accumulating coordination logic; check routing — shell must not own paths below the first segment (load `references/routing-ownership.md`).
6. **Rule 5** — if webpack/vite config or CI/CD is in scope, look for versioned remote URLs in the shell config, build-time MFE imports, or `needs:` coupling in pipelines.
7. **Rules 1 and 8** — naming and ownership: does the name reflect a business capability? Is there a clear owning team?
8. **Governance extensions** — feature flags inside MFEs (not shell orchestration), edge rationale (latency/routing/canary), SSR route ownership, and architecture fitness functions (for example `ts-arch` + `jest`) for monorepos.

## Reporting violations

**For a full boundary audit**: lead with violations in severity order. For each violation, name the rule, identify the specific code location, and explain the consequence in one sentence. End with a brief list of rules that are satisfied, then the highest-impact fixes in order. For single-violation reviews, inline annotation is preferable to a full report.

**Inline annotation format** (use during code review for individual violations):
```javascript
// ✗ Rule 3 CRITICAL — direct import from another MFE's internals
// bypasses the API contract; defeats independent deployment
import { userStore } from '@org/auth-mfe/store'
```

**Boundary note format** (use after generating code with a necessary rule trade-off):
```text
Boundary note: Rule 2 relaxed — 6 props passed per user constraint.
Consequence: the container owns more context than the micro-frontend should require.
Watch for: increasing coordination as props evolve; consider whether this boundary is in the right place.
```

## Examples

**Example 1 — shell generation**
User says: "Generate the shell code to mount our CheckoutMFE using Module Federation. It needs the user ID and cart ID."
Expected: Generate shell with `React.lazy` dynamic import, `ErrorBoundary` wrapping in shell, identifiers only as props. No static import, no domain objects.

**Example 2 — violation review**
User says: "Review this code" + pastes shell with `import { useAuthStore } from '@org/auth-mfe/store'`
Expected: Flag Rule 3 Critical violation. Explain alias does not fix coupling. Recommend sessionStorage or InjectionToken pattern.

**Example 3 — new project**
User says: "Help me create a micro-frontend for the loyalty points feature."
Expected: Trigger cold start. Ask team ownership first. Do not generate code until all three checks resolved.

---

## Troubleshooting

**No framework context provided**
User pastes code with no identifiable toolchain (no `ModuleFederationPlugin`, no `loadRemoteModule`, no `registerApplication`).
Action: Apply rules at the principle level using framework-agnostic patterns. Ask one question: "Which toolchain are you using — Module Federation, Native Federation, or Single SPA?" before generating toolchain-specific code.

**Boundary fails multiple rules simultaneously**
User code violates Rules 2, 3, and 4 at once (too many props, cross-boundary import, and shared store).
Action: Report Critical violations first (Rules 3 and 4), then High (Rule 2). Do not bundle into a single issue. Each violation has a distinct root cause and fix. Load `references/remediation.md`.

**User asks for a decision requiring team context**
User asks "how many MFEs should we have?" or "is this the right boundary?" without team information.
Action: Do not give a number or validate the boundary. Ask the team ownership and domain question from Check 1 and Check 2 first. The answer depends entirely on team structure, not on the code.

_Reference detail is split into separate rules in `.cursor/rules/` — load on demand._
