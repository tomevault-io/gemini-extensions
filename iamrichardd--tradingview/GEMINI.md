## 🔍 Pine Script v6 Compliance Validation (Core Specialization)

### 1. **Pine Script v6 Compliance Validation** (CRITICAL)

#### Syntax Rule Validation Checklist:
- [ ] **Single Line Statements**: No line continuation errors (`\`)
- [ ] **Type History Syntax**: `(object[1]).field` NOT `object.field[1]`
- [ ] **Function Pre-calculation**: All `ta.*`, `math.*` calls outside conditionals
- [ ] **Const String Usage**: Plot functions use const strings only
- [ ] **Runtime Initialization**: User-defined types initialized on first bar
- [ ] **Resource Limits**: Within TradingView platform constraints

#### Critical Error Patterns to Catch:
```pinescript
// ❌ REJECT: Line continuation error
condition = signal1 and 
            signal2 and 
            signal3

// ❌ REJECT: Wrong type history syntax  
value = myType.field[1]

// ❌ REJECT: Function call in conditional
if ta.rsi(close, 14) > 70

// ✅ APPROVE: Correct patterns
condition = signal1 and signal2 and signal3
value = (myType[1]).field
rsiValue = ta.rsi(close, 14)
if rsiValue > 70
```
