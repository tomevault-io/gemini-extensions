# nbox for agents

`nbox` is a CLI + TUI for NetBox (DCIM/IPAM). For programmatic/agent use, drive the
CLI subcommands with machine-readable output. The interactive TUI (`nbox` with no
subcommand) is for humans; agents should always pass a subcommand. Pass `--no-tui`
to make that a hard guarantee: any invocation that would launch the TUI (a bare
`nbox`, or `nbox tui`) refuses with a usage error (exit 2) instead of blocking on a
terminal.

## Output

- `--json` / `-o json` — JSON to stdout (pretty by default).
- `--raw` — compact JSON (one line; pairs with `--json`).
- `--envelope` — wrap as `{ "schema_version": 1, "data": <payload> }` for stable parsing.
- `--fields a,b,c` — keep only those top-level fields (per element for arrays).
- `-o csv` — CSV for tabular/list results (e.g. `search`); arrays render as a table. Single objects are rejected (exit 2) — use `--json` or plain.

stdout carries only the requested data; logs/diagnostics/errors go to stderr.

Exit codes (stable):

| Code | Meaning                                   |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 0    | success                                   |
| 1    | generic error (incl. other API failures)  |
| 2    | usage error (bad arguments)               |
| 3    | authentication / permission (HTTP 401/403)|
| 4    | not found (no object matched)             |
| 5    | ambiguous reference (more than one match) |

Recommended agent invocation: `nbox <cmd> ... --json --envelope` (add `--raw` to
minimize tokens, `--fields` to trim payloads).

A reference that matches more than one object across scopes (an address/CIDR in
several VRFs, a VID at several sites) exits `5` and lists the candidates; scope it
with `--vrf` / `--site` / `--group`. `search` fails closed: if any endpoint errors
it exits non-zero rather than return partial results — pass `--partial` for
best-effort results (failed endpoints are reported on stderr).

## MCP server

`nbox serve` runs an MCP server over stdio (read-only by default). An MCP host
launches it as a subprocess and speaks JSON-RPC over stdin/stdout; the tools reuse
the CLI's query + view layer, so they return the same JSON view models. URL/token
come from the active profile (same `--profile` / `--config` flags). JSON-RPC is on
stdout; logs go to stderr. Read tools are annotated `read_only_hint = true`.

**Write tools (opt-in):** `nbox_plan_write` and `nbox_apply_write` reuse the
CLI's ADR-0001 safe-write engine: plan-first, confirm-token-gated, and backed by
the server-issued plan store. Local stdio writes require `nbox serve
--local-writes` / `[serve].local_writes` and use the active profile token. Shared
HTTP/OIDC writes require `nbox serve --http --allow-writes` plus a
`[serve.vault]` mapping each caller's OIDC `sub` to a per-user NetBox token (env
var) and the caller's `nbox:write` scope. `nbox serve --print-config` prints the
paste-ready `mcpServers` JSON (absolute binary path, echoed `--profile`/`--config`/
`--local-writes`, placeholder token) and exits — no server start, no NetBox connection.

| Tool | Purpose |
| ---- | ------- |
| `nbox_status` | Connection + active backend capabilities + NetBox/Django/Python versions **and a token-validity preflight** (NetBox 4.5+): the `token` field is `valid`/`invalid`/`unverified` (the authenticated user on `valid`). Call first to confirm reachability, a valid token, and inspect `capabilities`. |
| `nbox_search` | Search devices/sites/racks/rack-groups/IPs/prefixes/VLANs/circuits/virtual-circuits/aggregates/ASNs/IP ranges/tenants/contacts/providers/VMs/VM-types/clusters/VRFs/route-targets; `query` (required), `limit`, `status`, `site`, `region`, `site_group`, `location`, `tenant`, `role`, `tag` (one scope filter at a time), `owner`/`owner_group` (4.5+; user/group by name), `vrf` (id\|rd\|name; filters IP/prefix results only), `fields` (optional; keep only those top-level keys per hit to trim tokens — unknown keys ignored). Find a reference before `nbox_get`; a result's `kind` (e.g. `ip_address`) feeds straight into `nbox_get`, which accepts it as an alias for `ip`. |
| `nbox_get` | One object: `kind` (device, ip, prefix, vlan, site, rack, rack_group, circuit, virtual_circuit, aggregate, asn, ip_range, tenant, contact, provider, vm, vm_type, cluster, vrf, route_target, mac, interface) + `ref`; `vrf`/`site`/`group` disambiguate (an ambiguous ref returns the candidates); `fields` (optional; keep only those top-level keys to trim tokens — unknown keys ignored). |
| `nbox_get_interface` | One interface on a device: config, addresses, cable-path trace. |
| `nbox_next_ip` | Next available address(es) in a prefix (nothing reserved); `count`, `vrf`. |
| `nbox_next_prefix` | Available child prefix(es) in a prefix; `length` for a block of a size, else all free blocks; `vrf`. |
| `nbox_journal` | Recent journal entries for an object (`kind`/`ref` as `nbox_get`). |
| `nbox_history` | Change history (system audit log: create/update/delete, who + when) for an object (`kind`/`ref` as `nbox_get`); `/api/core/object-changes/` (NetBox 4.x). Distinct from `nbox_journal` (operator notes): this is the system-recorded audit trail. Each row includes the top-level fields that changed (pre vs post); pass `diff=true` (pair with a small `limit`, e.g. 1) to include the full before/after JSON payloads per row. |
| `nbox_list_tags` | List tags (name, slug, color, usage count) — valid `tag` values for `nbox_search`. |
| `nbox_tagged` | Objects carrying a tag, across kinds (NetBox 4.3+); `tag` (id\|name\|slug). Cross-kind reverse lookup — unlike `nbox_search --tag`, which narrows a free-text search per-endpoint. |
| `nbox_cache_clear` | Drop nbox's local read cache so the next lookups fetch fresh from NetBox (read-only w.r.t. NetBox; idempotent). |
| `nbox_plan_write` | Plan a write operation (interface description, device status, IP/prefix/IP-range reserve, tag add/remove). Builds a `MutationPlan` with a before/after diff and confirm token, without mutating. Review the plan, then call `nbox_apply_write`. Requires local stdio `--local-writes`, or shared HTTP/OIDC `--allow-writes` + caller `nbox:write` + `[serve.vault]` per-user credential mapping. |
| `nbox_apply_write` | Apply a previously planned write. Pass the full `MutationPlan` JSON from `nbox_plan_write`. The confirm token looks up the server-stored plan; forged, edited, or replayed plans are rejected. Returns a `MutationReceipt`. Same gating as `nbox_plan_write`. |

The same objects are also exposed as MCP **resources** via one template,
`nbox://{kind}/{ref}` (e.g. `nbox://device/edge01`, `nbox://ip/10.0.0.1`), for
hosts that browse/attach resources instead of calling tools. Reading one returns
the same JSON view as `nbox_get`, routed through the same view layer; `kind`/`ref`
follow `nbox_get` (percent-encode a `ref` with `/`, e.g. a CIDR). It's a template,
not a static list, so `resources/list` is empty.

A small catalog of **read-only investigation prompts** (`prompts/list`/
`prompts/get`) ships with it: `ip_utilization_audit`, `cable_path_trace`,
`find_stale_prefixes`, `object_change_review`. Each returns a user-role message
with a structured plan naming the exact nbox tools to call (incl. `nbox_history`),
tailored to the supplied arguments — a plan, not data (no NetBox round-trip).

An HTTP transport ships in the default build (behind the `http` cargo feature,
which is on by default; `--no-default-features` for stdio-only):
`nbox serve --http 127.0.0.1:8080`, optional `--http-token` — same tools at
`/mcp`, loopback only, with `Origin`/`Host` validation. Add `--oidc-issuer <URL>`
+ `--audience <VALUE>` for OAuth 2.1 resource-server mode: inbound IdP JWTs are
validated on `/mcp` (alg allowlist, `iss`/`aud`/`exp`, `nbox:read` scope), a
routable bind is allowed (TLS terminates in front), and Protected Resource
Metadata is served at `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource`. The HTTP `/mcp`
path also has an ops layer: a structured audit log (one `tracing` event per
authenticated request under the target `nbox::audit` — WHO/WHAT/WHEN/OUTCOME, no
token ever; off under the default `warn` filter, opt in with
`NBOX_LOG=…,nbox::audit=info`) and an opt-in per-caller rate limit
(`--rate-limit <N>` / `[serve].rate_limit`, keyed `sub`→`client_id`→peer IP, over
the limit → `429`+`Retry-After`; `0`/absent = off). Run without `--allow-writes`
this is **read-only Pattern 3**: the last hop to NetBox uses the one local profile
token, so the audit log is accountability, not per-user RBAC — trusted single-team
read-only. Adding `--allow-writes` layers on the shipped Pattern 2 write vault
(per-user NetBox identity bridging via `[serve.vault]`). A raw escape-hatch MCP
tool and full per-prompt argument schemas are later. See `docs/MCP.md`.

## Configuration

- Config: `~/.config/nbox/config.toml` (`nbox config init` to create).
- Token: resolved in order: the profile's `token_env` variable (if set & present)
  → `NBOX_TOKEN` → the profile's config `token` → none. Env always overrides
  saved tokens. Inspect the active source with `nbox config token status` (never
  prints the token).
  Select a profile with `--profile <name>` or set the active one.
- Backends: REST is canonical. GraphQL is an opt-in per-surface accelerator set
  under `[profiles.<name>.api]` (`vrf`/`route_target` = `rest`|`graphql`; missing = REST). nbox
  probes `/graphql/`, adapts to NetBox 4.2/4.3/4.5+ filter/pagination shapes, and
  falls back to REST (with the reason in `nbox status`) when a surface isn't
  supported. The output shape is identical either way. **Search is always REST** —
  NetBox GraphQL has no equivalent to REST's full-text `q`, so a `search =
  "graphql"` preference transparently falls back. The old coarse `backend = …` key
  was removed and is rejected. Identity resolution and all other operations remain
  REST-backed.
- Logging: quiet by default (warnings to stderr). `--log-level` / `NBOX_LOG` /
  `RUST_LOG` set verbosity; `--log-file <PATH>` (or config `log_file`) also tees
  `tracing` output to a file. stdout stays data-only on every path.
- Targets NetBox 4.2+.

## Examples

```bash
nbox device edge01 --json --envelope
nbox ip 10.44.208.55 --json --fields address,parent_prefix,scope,scope_type,assigned
nbox search edge --status active --site dc1 -o csv --cols kind,display,url
nbox device edge01 --json | jq '.primary_ip4'
```
- Writes landed behind ADR-0001. Seven commands reuse the same safe-write
  foundation (the `MutationPlan` / `MutationReceipt` engine):
  `nbox interface <device> <interface> set description "…"`,
  `nbox device <name> set status <value>`,
  `nbox ip reserve <cidr>` (a `POST` to `available-ips` — the first `allocate`),
  `nbox prefix reserve <cidr>` (a `POST` to `available-prefixes` — the second `allocate`),
  `nbox ip-range reserve <start|id>` (a `POST` to a range's `available-ips` — the third `allocate`),
  `nbox tag add <type> <name> <tag>` (a `PATCH` to the `tags` array on any
  object kind), and `nbox tag remove <type> <name> <tag>` (the inverse). All are
  plan-first: reads remain the default — apply needs BOTH `--allow-writes` (the
  gate) AND `--confirm` (or a TTY prompt in plain output); `--dry-run` previews
  with no mutation and needs neither. `--confirm` without `--allow-writes` is a
  usage error (exit 2, empty stdout). Non-TTY / `--json` / `--csv` / `--no-tui`
  never prompt. `--json --dry-run` returns the stable `MutationPlan`;
  `--json --confirm` returns a `MutationReceipt` (both `schema_version: 1`).
  For `device set status`, the allowed values are enumerated live from NetBox
  (read-only `OPTIONS`) and the input is normalized to the canonical value (a
  label is accepted case-insensitively when it maps unambiguously to one value);
  an unknown or ambiguous status is a usage error (exit 2) naming the input and
  listing the allowed values, before any `PATCH`. For `tag add`/`remove`, the
  tag resolves by id/name/slug (same resolver as `nbox tagged`); the target
  object resolves the same way as `nbox <kind> <ref>`. NetBox `PATCH` replaces
  the whole `tags` array, so the plan carries the full replacement slug list;
  adding a tag the object already carries (or removing one it doesn't) is a
  no-op (no `PATCH`). For `prefix reserve`, the body carries optional
  `prefix_length` and `description`; the server allocates the block and the
  receipt returns the created prefix. For `ip-range reserve`, the body carries
  optional `description` and `dns_name`; the server allocates the address and
  the receipt returns the created IP. `ip reserve` and `ip-range reserve` accept
  `--count N` to reserve N IPs atomically in one call (a single list-body POST —
  NetBox allocates all N or zero; `count` is bound into the confirmation token);
  any failure leaves nothing created and exits 1, and the receipt's `object` is a
  JSON array of the N created IPs. The MCP server is read-only by default; write tools (`nbox_plan_write`/`nbox_apply_write`) require either local stdio `--local-writes` or shared HTTP/OIDC `--allow-writes` + caller `nbox:write` + the per-user vault.
- Filters that an object type can't satisfy cause that type to be skipped in
  `search` (nbox does not send NetBox unknown query params).
- `owner` (NetBox 4.5+): a native owner field (user or group) surfaced on most
  detail views as a friendly label, omitted when absent (byte-identical for
  pre-4.5 objects). In `search`, `--owner`/`--owner-group` filter by user/group
  name; owner is polymorphic (user **or** group) so the two are separate filters,
  and both are silently ignored on releases that carry no owner data.
- Scope fields (NetBox 4.2+ polymorphic scope): `prefix` and `vlan` carry
  `scope` (the scope object's name, for any scope type) and `scope_type` (a
  friendly label — `site`, `location`, `region`, `site-group`, or the raw
  content type for anything else). `ip` derives `scope`/`scope_type` from its
  most-specific parent prefix. Each is omitted when there is no scope. (There is
  no `site` field on these views — use `scope`/`scope_type`.)
- A `vlan` that belongs to a *VLAN group* additionally carries `group_scope` and
  `group_scope_type`: a VLAN group is itself polymorphically scoped (the VLAN is
  not), so this is the group's scope, surfaced separately from the VLAN's own
  `scope`. Populated by one follow-up fetch of the group, only when the VLAN has
  a group and that group is scoped; both fields are omitted otherwise.
