# Development Guidelines

## Rules

These are non-negotiable. Every rule applies to all communication: responses, commits, docs, code comments.

1. **Plain, factual writing**. Applies everywhere: responses, commits, code comments, docs, PR bodies, issue descriptions.
   - **Banned superlatives and marketing speak**: comprehensive, critical, major, robust, powerful, extensively, thoroughly, excellent, amazing, significant, seamless, intuitive, user-friendly, modern, cutting-edge, state-of-the-art, best-in-class, ground-up rewrite, world-class, blazingly fast.
   - **Banned AI slop and storytelling**: "Let's...", "As you can see", "It's important to note", "Imagine you have...", "In the real world", "Key Takeaways" or "Summary" sections that restate what was already said, multi-paragraph "why we did it this way" essays.
   - **Banned hand-wavy claims**: "designed to scale", "built for the modern web", "production-ready". State the specific fact (e.g. "handles 50k events/min on a Pi 4") or cut the claim.
   - **No em-dashes** (—). Use a period, comma, colon, or rephrase. Example: replace "Token refresh runs every 60s — checks expiry and refreshes if within leeway" with "Token refresh runs every 60s. It checks expiry and refreshes if within leeway."
   - First-person honesty is fine ("this was primarily to educate me as I did not have React experience"). Don't sand it off.
2. **Issues first**: create a GitHub issue before implementing features or fixing bugs. If an issue already exists, refer to it. 
3. **Test first, verify before commit**: write tests first, run `npm test` + `tsc --noEmit` + `npm run build` + relevant e2e tests before every commit. Build passing is not proof code works. **Always run `npm run build` (not just `tsc --noEmit`) as the final check**: `tsc -b` used by the build catches stricter errors (unused variables, type narrowing) that `tsc --noEmit` misses. Never commit if the build fails.
4. **Update docs**: update `docs/developer-guide/` in the same session when adding new APIs, components, utilities, or hooks and/or `docs/user-guide` for changed/updated or new functionality
5. **i18n all languages**: never hardcode user-facing strings. Update ALL translation files: en, de, es, fr, zh.
6. **Cross-platform**: test on iOS, Android, Electron desktop, phone portrait + landscape. Device e2e tests (`ios-phone`, `android`, etc.) are manual-invoke-only. Only `npm run test:e2e` (web) runs in the automated workflow.
7. **Profile-scoped settings**: read/write via `getProfileSettings`/`updateProfileSettings`. Never use global singletons.
8. **Bandwidth settings**: all polling/refresh features must use `useBandwidthSettings()` (or `getBandwidthSettings()` outside React). Never hardcode polling intervals.
9. **Logging**: use `log.*` component helpers with explicit LogLevel, never `console.*`. See `lib/logger.ts` for available helpers.
10. **HTTP**: use `lib/http.ts` abstractions (`httpGet`, `httpPost`, etc.), never raw `fetch()` or `axios`.
11. **Text overflow**: use `truncate` + `min-w-0` in flex containers; add `title` for tooltips. Multi-line: `line-clamp-N`.
12. **Small files**: DRY, ~400 LOC max, extract complex logic to separate modules.
13. **`data-testid`**: add `data-testid="kebab-case-name"` to all interactive elements. Required for e2e tests.
14. **Capacitor plugins**: dynamic imports only with platform checks. Never static imports. Match `@capacitor/core` major version. Add mock to `tests/setup.ts`.
15. **Mobile downloads**: use CapacitorHttp base64 directly. Never convert to Blob on mobile (OOM risk).
16. **No plan files in git**: delete `.md` plan files once the feature is complete.
17. **Complete features fully**: don't leave features half-implemented.
18. **User approval before merge**: never merge to main without user approval.
19. **One logical change per commit**: use conventional format: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`. Reference issues with `refs #<id>` or `fixes #<id>`.
20. **Don't batch unrelated changes**: split into separate commits.
21. **Analyze test failures**: read error output and fix systematically. Don't retry blindly.
22. **Concise i18n labels**: button, tab, and action labels must be short across all languages. Prefer single-word synonyms (ES: "Ajustes" not "Configuración", DE: "Speichern" not "Änderungen speichern", FR: "Enregistrer" not "Enregistrer les modifications"). Test translations fit on a 320px-wide phone screen. Add `min-w-0` + `truncate` to flex containers with translated button text as a safety net.
23. **Date/time formatting**: all user-facing date/time display must use `useDateTimeFormat()` hook (or `formatAppDate`/`formatAppTime`/`formatAppDateTime` from `lib/format-date-time.ts` outside React). Never hardcode date-fns `format()` with literal patterns for user-visible output. This includes canvas rendering, tooltips, labels, and scrubber overlays.
24. **Self-correcting rules**: this file is a living guardrail set; keep it current in the same session. Add or tighten a rule whenever (a) the user gives guidance that establishes a general pattern (e.g., "all X should use Y"), or (b) a bug, regression, or mistake surfaces that a rule could have prevented, including ones you introduced. Write the smallest general rule that would have caught it, plus the why in a few words. Prefer a one-line rule to a retelling of the incident. When the lesson is a one-off fact tied to specific code rather than a general pattern, put it in a code comment at that site instead of here.
25. **Centralized constants**: every named constant (timeouts, thresholds, storage keys, animation durations, magic numbers with semantic meaning) lives in `lib/zmninja-ng-constants.ts` (app-level) or `lib/zm-constants.ts` (ZoneMinder protocol-level). Import from there; do not redeclare per file. CSS pixel values inline in JSX/styles are fine; ad-hoc numbers used once with no semantic name are fine.
26. **Identify yourself on GitHub**: whenever you post a comment on a GitHub issue or PR, identify yourself as Claude assisting @pliablepixels. End the comment with a line such as `Posted by Claude, assisting @pliablepixels.` This line is only for GitHub comments. Never put it in git commit messages: commits use the usual `Co-Authored-By: Claude ...` signature and nothing else.
27. **Hardening must not silently break a feature**: a security or behavioral change on a native or CI-untestable path (TLS/cert handling, WebView, native plugins, Electron) is not done until the affected feature is verified on a real device. Prefer the least-breaking option. If a finding can only be resolved by breaking a working feature (trust-on-first-use has to accept a cert before it can pin it; ZoneMinder authenticates go2rtc via the credentials embedded in its URL), document it as accepted risk instead of shipping the break. Flag every native/Electron change as needing a manual device pass before merge.
28. **Don't commit incidental build artifacts**: `npm run build` bumps native build numbers (`app/android/app/build.gradle` `versionCode`, `app/ios/App/App.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION`). Revert them with `git checkout --` before committing a feature or fix; only ever commit a bump in a dedicated `chore:` commit.

---

## Working Directory

All `npm` commands must be run from the `app/` directory.

Structure:
- `./`: workspace root (AGENTS.md, docs/, scripts/)
- `app/`: main application (run npm commands here)
- `app/src/`: source code
- `app/tests/`: e2e test features and helpers

---

## Testing

### Philosophy: Be a Human Tester
Every test must verify what a real human would verify: "Can I accomplish this task? Does this look right? Does the data make sense?"

- Verify outcomes (data changed, navigation happened, file downloaded), not just element presence
- Fill forms and verify data persists after refresh or navigation
- Test error states, edge cases, and device-specific layout behavior
- Add `@visual` screenshots to catch layout regressions
- Never write "check heading is visible" as a test. That's not testing anything
- Never mock the thing you're testing

### Test-First Workflow
1. Understand the bug/feature requirement
2. Write a failing test that reproduces the issue
3. Implement the fix/feature
4. Run tests, verify they pass
5. Run full test suite to check for regressions
6. Commit

### Unit Tests
**Location**: Next to source in `__tests__/` subdirectory (e.g., `lib/crypto.ts` → `lib/__tests__/crypto.test.ts`)

**What to test**: Happy path, edge cases (empty/null/undefined), error cases, state changes

**Run**: `npm test`

### E2E Tests
**When required**: UI changes, navigation changes, interaction changes, new workflows

**Location**: `app/tests/features/*.feature` (Gherkin format, never .spec.ts directly)

**Step definitions**: `app/tests/steps/<screen>.steps.ts` (one file per screen, not one monolith)

**Run**: `npm run test:e2e -- <feature>.feature`

### Cross-Platform E2E Tests
Tests run on 4 platform profiles using two drivers. Playwright drives Chromium-based platforms (web, Android) via CDP. WebDriverIO + Appium drives WebKit-based iOS platforms via XCUITest. A shared `TestActions` abstraction keeps step definitions driver-agnostic.

| Profile | Device | Driver | Connection |
|---|---|---|---|
| `web-chromium` | Desktop browser | Playwright | Direct launch |
| `android-phone` | Pixel 7 Emulator | Playwright | ADB port-forward to CDP |
| `ios-phone` | iPhone 15 Simulator | WebDriverIO + Appium XCUITest | WebView context switch |
| `ios-tablet` | iPad Air Simulator | WebDriverIO + Appium XCUITest | WebView context switch |

### Platform Tags
- `@all`: every platform | `@android`: Android only | `@ios`: iPhone + iPad
- `@ios-phone` / `@ios-tablet`: specific iOS form factor
- `@web`: browser only
- `@visual`: comparison screenshots | `@native`: requires Appium

### Test Commands
```bash
# Unit tests
npm test                                # Unit tests
npm test -- --coverage                  # With coverage

# E2E tests (web browser only - fast)
npm run test:e2e                        # All web e2e tests
npm run test:e2e -- <feature>.feature   # Specific feature
npm run test:e2e -- --headed            # See browser

# Cross-platform e2e (requires simulators/emulators)
npm run test:e2e:android                # Android emulator
npm run test:e2e:ios-phone              # iPhone simulator
npm run test:e2e:ios-tablet             # iPad simulator
npm run test:e2e:all-platforms          # All platforms sequentially

# Visual regression
npm run test:e2e:visual-update          # Regenerate all baselines
npm run test:e2e:android -- --update-snapshots  # Platform-specific

# Native-only (Appium): PiP, biometrics, push, downloads
npm run test:native

# Setup verification
npm run test:platform:setup             # Check tools, simulators, ports
```

### Platform Test Configuration
Simulator names, ports, and timeouts are in `app/tests/platforms.config.defaults.ts`. To customize for your machine, copy to `platforms.config.local.ts` (gitignored) and edit.

Server credentials in `.env`:
```bash
ZM_HOST_1=http://your-server:port
ZM_USER_1=admin
ZM_PASSWORD_1=password
```

### Visual Regression
Scenarios tagged `@visual` capture screenshots and compare against per-platform baselines in `app/tests/screenshots/<platform>/`. Threshold: 0.2% pixel diff. First run on a new platform: use `--update-snapshots` to generate baselines.

### Writing Good E2E Tests

Ask: "If I were a human QA tester with this feature on 5 devices, what would I check?"

**Good** (tests a user goal with interaction + outcome verification):
```gherkin
@all @visual
Scenario: Create and verify a new widget
  Given I am logged into zmNinjaNg
  When I navigate to the "Dashboard" page
  And I open the Add Widget dialog
  And I select widget type "My New Widget"
  And I enter the title "Test Widget"
  And I save the widget
  Then the widget "Test Widget" should appear on the dashboard
  And the widget should display real data
  When I refresh the page
  Then the widget "Test Widget" should still be present
  And the page should match the visual baseline
```

- One scenario per user goal, not per element
- Add `@ios-phone @android` for phone layout, `@ios-tablet` for tablet
- Step definitions in `app/tests/steps/<screen>.steps.ts` using `TestActions` (not raw Playwright/WebDriverIO)
- Run `--update-snapshots` on each platform for visual baselines

### Conditional Testing Pattern
For features depending on dynamic content:
```typescript
let actionPerformed = false;

When('I click download if exists', async ({ page }) => {
  const button = page.getByTestId('download-button');
  if (await button.isVisible({ timeout: 1000 })) {
    await button.click();
    actionPerformed = true;
  }
});

Then('I should see progress if started', async ({ page }) => {
  if (!actionPerformed) return;
  await expect(page.getByTestId('progress')).toBeVisible();
});
```

### Native-Only Tests (Appium)
For flows requiring native OS interaction (PiP, biometric auth, push, native file downloads, share sheet, app lifecycle): `app/tests/native/specs/<feature>.spec.ts`

---

## Verification & Commits

For every code change, execute in order:

1. `npm test`: must pass
2. `npx tsc --noEmit`: must pass
3. `npm run build`: must succeed
4. `npm run test:e2e -- <feature>.feature` (if UI/navigation changed)
5. Commit only after all pass

State which tests were run: "Tests verified: npm test ✓, tsc --noEmit ✓, build ✓, test:e2e -- dashboard.feature ✓"

**UI changes also require**: `data-testid` on new elements, e2e tests in `.feature` file with platform tags, visual baselines updated, all language files updated.

**Native plugin changes also require**: Appium test in `app/tests/native/specs/`.

**Never commit if**: tests are failing, tests don't exist for new functionality, you haven't actually run the tests, or you wrote a scenario that only checks element presence without interaction.

### Feature Workflow
1. Create GitHub issue: `gh issue create --title "feat: Description" --body "..." --label "enhancement"` (or `--label "bug"` for bugs)
2. Create branch: `git checkout -b feature/<short-description>` (no branch needed for bug fixes)
3. Implement with tests
4. Request user approval before merging
5. Tag commits: `refs #<id>`, use `fixes #<id>` in final commit only after user confirms the fix works

---

## Code Patterns

### Internationalization
```typescript
const { t } = useTranslation();
<Text>{t('setup.title')}</Text>
toast.error(t('montage.screen_too_small'));
```
Location: `app/src/locales/{lang}/translation.json`: update all 5 languages.

### Logging
```typescript
import { log, LogLevel } from '../lib/logger';
log.secureStorage('Value encrypted', LogLevel.DEBUG, { key });
log.profileForm('Testing connection', LogLevel.INFO, { portalUrl });
log.download('Failed to download', LogLevel.ERROR, { url }, error);
```
See `lib/logger.ts` for the full list of component-specific helpers (e.g., `log.auth`, `log.notifications`, `log.http`, etc.).

### HTTP Requests
```typescript
import { httpGet, httpPost, httpPut, httpDelete } from '../lib/http';
const data = await httpGet<MonitorData>('/api/monitors.json');
await httpPost('/api/states/change.json', { monitorId: '1', newState: 'Alert' });
```
Handles platform differences (Capacitor HTTP on mobile, fetch on web), logging, and authentication automatically.

### Date/Time Formatting
```typescript
// In React components
import { useDateTimeFormat } from '../hooks/useDateTimeFormat';
const { fmtDate, fmtTime, fmtTimeShort, fmtDateTime, fmtDateTimeShort } = useDateTimeFormat();
<span>{fmtDateTime(new Date())}</span>

// Outside React (services, renderers, canvas)
import { formatAppDate, formatAppTimeShort, type FormatSettings } from '../lib/format-date-time';
formatAppTimeShort(date, settings);
```
Never use `format(date, 'HH:mm')` or similar hardcoded patterns for user-visible output.

### Text Overflow
```tsx
<div className="flex items-center gap-2">
  <span className="truncate min-w-0" title={text}>{text}</span>
</div>
```

### Capacitor Dynamic Imports
```typescript
// Good
if (Capacitor.isNativePlatform()) {
  try {
    const { Haptics, ImpactStyle } = await import('@capacitor/haptics');
    await Haptics.impact({ style: ImpactStyle.Light });
  } catch { /* not available */ }
}
// Bad: static import breaks on web
import { Haptics } from '@capacitor/haptics';
```

### Background Tasks & Downloads
```typescript
const taskStore = useBackgroundTasks.getState();
const taskId = taskStore.addTask({
  type: 'download',
  metadata: { title: 'Video.mp4', description: 'Event 12345' },
  cancelFn: () => abortController.abort(),
});
taskStore.updateProgress(taskId, percentage, bytesProcessed);
taskStore.completeTask(taskId);
```
On mobile, use CapacitorHttp base64 directly. Never convert to Blob (OOM risk).

### Bandwidth Settings
Use `useBandwidthSettings()` in React components or `getBandwidthSettings(mode)` in services. See `BandwidthSettings` interface in `lib/zmninja-ng-constants.ts` for available properties.

```typescript
import { useBandwidthSettings } from '../hooks/useBandwidthSettings';
const bandwidth = useBandwidthSettings();

const { data } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ['monitors'],
  queryFn: getMonitors,
  refetchInterval: bandwidth.monitorStatusInterval,
});
```

To add a new polling property: add to the `BandwidthSettings` interface and both `normal`/`low` objects in `BANDWIDTH_SETTINGS` (low mode should be ~2x slower).

### Settings & Data Management
Settings must be profile-scoped via `getProfileSettings`/`updateProfileSettings`. Detect version/structure changes in stored data. If incompatible, prompt user to reset (don't crash).

### Adding Dependencies
1. Check compatibility: `npm info <package> peerDependencies`
2. For Capacitor plugins: match `@capacitor/core` major version
3. Update test mocks in `app/src/tests/setup.ts` if needed
4. Verify: `npm test && npm run build`

---

## Documentation

### Where things go

Update `docs/developer-guide/` when adding:
- API modules (`api/*.ts`) → `07-api-and-data-fetching.rst`
- Components (`components/*.tsx`) → `05-component-architecture.rst`
- Utilities (`lib/*.ts`) → `12-shared-services-and-components.rst`
- Hooks (`hooks/*.ts`) → `05-component-architecture.rst` or relevant chapter

Document purpose, usage examples, key functions/props, integration patterns, and platform-specific gotchas.

### Style

The tone target is `docs/developer-guide/01-introduction.rst`. Match it.

In addition to rule 1 above:

- **No top-of-file Table of Contents.** Sphinx generates one from headings.
- **No "Next Steps" / "Continue to chapter X" sections.** The TOC handles forward navigation.
- **No "Key Takeaways" or "Summary" recaps.** If a fact is worth restating, put it in the body. Don't restate the chapter at the end of the chapter.
- **Don't reword passages already concise and factual.** Three similar lines beats a forced rewrite. Edit only what's wrong, padded, or unclear.
- **Code examples must come from the actual codebase.** Verify with `grep` before writing or editing: function names get renamed, constants change values, files move. The doc must match `app/src/` as it stands today.
- **Cite specific values, not ranges.** Read the constant from `lib/zmninja-ng-constants.ts` and write that. "Refreshes within 30 minutes of expiry" beats "refreshes shortly before expiry".
- **Cross-references**: `:doc:\`relative-path\`` in RST, `{doc}\`relative-path\`` in Markdown. Verify the target file exists.
- **Honest first-person framing is welcome** when it's accurate ("I built this to learn React"). Don't replace it with corporate voice.
- **Trim around code, not the code itself.** When tightening, cut the prose paragraphs around an example before touching the example.
- **Match the canonical file shape**: title with section underline (RST) or `# Title` (Markdown), one-paragraph framing (or none), then sections. No preamble blocks announcing what the chapter will cover.

When adding a new chapter or rewriting an existing one, run a banned-words grep before committing:

```bash
grep -niE "\b(comprehensive|robust|powerful|extensively|thoroughly|excellent|amazing|seamless|cutting.edge|state.of.the.art|user.friendly|ground.up rewrite)\b" <file>
grep -n "—" <file>   # em-dashes
```

Both should return zero hits.

---

## Code Quality

- DRY, modular code. Three similar lines > premature abstraction.
- Target ~400 LOC max per file. Extract cohesive blocks to separate modules.
- Delete old code completely when replacing functionality. Don't leave unused files or commented code.
- For complex features with multiple approaches or UX changes: present options and get user approval before implementing.
