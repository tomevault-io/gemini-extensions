# Klangk agent instructions

Project-specific guidance for coding agents working in this repo.

## Prefix most commands with `devenv --quiet -O dotenv.enable:bool false shell --`

Klangk uses [devenv](https://devenv.sh) (Nix-based) for its dev environment. **Every command that touches the project toolchain must be run through the devenv shell**, including git. The toolchain — Python venv, Node, Dart/Flutter, podman, pre-commit hooks, etc. — only exists inside the shell.

```bash
devenv --quiet -O dotenv.enable:bool false shell -- git commit -m "..."
devenv --quiet -O dotenv.enable:bool false shell -- pytest
```

The flags: `--quiet` suppresses noisy devenv output; `-O dotenv.enable:bool false` prevents devenv from loading `.env` (which can interfere with test environments that set their own env vars via monkeypatch). `shell --` launches an ephemeral shell with the full environment, runs the command, and exits — this is the pattern agents should use for one-off commands. (`devenv shell` with no `--` drops into an interactive shell; not useful for non-interactive agents.) This applies to **all** commands: builds, tests, lint, `git`, `podman`, `flutter`, `gh`.

A long-running interactive `devenv up` (backend + nginx + workspace image build) is a human-facing workflow; agents generally don't run it. If you need the backend up for something, ask.

## Running tests (match CI)

Always run the test suites **the way CI runs them**. The exact invocations
are:

```bash
# Backend (100% coverage gate)
devenv --quiet -O dotenv.enable:bool false shell -- python -m pytest src/backend/tests -v -n auto

# CLI (100% coverage gate)
devenv --quiet -O dotenv.enable:bool false shell -- python -m pytest src/cli/tests -v -n auto

# Frontend
devenv --quiet -O dotenv.enable:bool false shell -- flutter test --coverage
```

`-n auto` (pytest-xdist) is **not optional** for the Python suites — it's how
CI runs them, and for the backend it is the difference between a real and a
bogus coverage number. The backend `conftest.py` sets
`COVERAGE_CORE=sysmon` specifically so that code executed inside
SQLAlchemy's greenlet context is tracked **in each xdist worker**; without
`-n` (a single-process run) that tracking under-counts and you'll see a
false ~93% total with heavy files like `api/auth.py` reported at ~55%.
Run with `-n auto` and coverage matches CI (100%, every module). Don't try
to "reproduce" a coverage drop from a single-process run — re-run with
`-n auto` first.

The 100% coverage gate is enforced in both Python suites; a new code path
with no test will fail the build. When iterating fast on one file you can
scope with `-k` / a path and add `--no-cov`, but re-run the full suite
**with** coverage (and `-n auto`) before committing.

## Process manager: devenv 2.x native (not process-compose)

`devenv processes up` / `devenv up` use **devenv 2.x's built-in process manager**,
not process-compose. Consequences when debugging a managed stack:

- `devenv processes list|status|logs|restart <NAME>` work without a separate
  `process-compose` daemon running — there is no `process-compose` binary or
  socket to look for. `ps` will **not** show a `process-compose` process; the
  manager is devenv itself.
- A crashed process is restarted by devenv's own supervisor (the journal shows
  `Process exited (Failure), restarting` / `Restarted (attempt N)`), and after
  enough attempts the whole `devenv processes up` invocation exits.
- On hosts that run the stack under systemd, the unit's `ExecStart` is
  `devenv processes up` (foreground, `DEVENV_TUI=false`); a crash loop in one
  process takes the unit down. Debug by running the suspect process directly
  under the devenv shell (bypassing the supervisor) to see its real stderr.

## Changelog (`docs/changes.md`)

`docs/changes.md` is the single source of truth for human-authored release notes,
formatted as [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). It has two
rendering surfaces:

- **Docs site** — the whole file renders as one page at `/changes/`, sidebar entry
  "Changelog" (nav is in `zensical.toml`). Includes the `## [Unreleased]`
  section, so in-flight work is visible.
- **Release tab** — when a `v*` tag is pushed, `release.yml` checks out the code
  **at the tag**, extracts that version's `## [<version>]` section, and prepends it
  to GitHub's auto-generated notes (PR list + compare link).

### When to add an entry

Add a bullet under `## [Unreleased]` **in the same PR that introduces the change**
(not as an afterthought, not after merge). Use the matching subsection:

- **Added** — new feature, config var, CLI flag, endpoint.
- **Changed** — change to existing behavior, default, or signature.
- **Deprecated** — soon-to-be-removed.
- **Removed** — now removed.
- **Fixed** — notable bug fix.
- **Security** — vulnerability fix.
- **Breaking** — sub-section under any version for changes requiring operator/integrator
  action on upgrade. Call out the migration.

Each entry: one line, reference the issue/PR (`(#1375)`), enough context that an
operator skimming the changelog understands the impact.

Add an entry for anything an **operator, integrator, or end user** would notice:
new/changed config or defaults, behavior changes, security fixes, notable fixes,
new features.

**Skip** entries for: pure internal refactors, test/CI/doc churn with no user-visible
effect, dependency bumps that don't change behavior. If in doubt, add it — it's easier
to trim at release time than to reconstruct.

### When to garden for a release

Right before pushing the tag — do this as its own commit on `main`:

1. Rename `## [Unreleased]` → `## [vX.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD`
   (today's date). The `v` prefix and bracket form **must match the tag exactly**;
   the `- YYYY-MM-DD` date suffix is optional but conventional. The workflow matches the section
   heading as a prefix, so `## [v1.0.5] - 2026-07-07` matches tag `v1.0.5`.
2. Insert a fresh, empty `## [Unreleased]` heading directly above it.
3. Commit, e.g. `chore(changelog): cut vX.Y.Z`.
4. Tag and push: `devenv --quiet -O dotenv.enable:bool false shell -- git tag vX.Y.Z && devenv --quiet -O dotenv.enable:bool false shell -- git push origin vX.Y.Z`.

**Critical sequencing:** `release.yml` checks out `docs/changes.md` at the tagged
commit, so the `[Unreleased]` → `[vX.Y.Z]` rename **must land in (or before) the
commit you tag**. If you tag a commit that still has the changes under
`[Unreleased]`, the workflow finds no `## [vX.Y.Z]` section and the release body
falls back to pure auto-generated notes — the human-authored section is silently lost.

### After a release

Nothing to do in `docs/changes.md` itself — the `[Unreleased]` heading you created
at cut time is already in place for the next cycle's entries. Just start adding new
entries under it.

## Demo video recording

Before **every** full recording run (CLI + browser scenes, or a re-run of just
the browser half), you MUST first destroy the hero account so all its
workspaces + containers cascade-delete with it. This is the only reliable way
to get a clean slate — a prior interrupted run or a browser-only re-run leaves
stale workspaces/tabs that corrupt the continuity later scenes assume.

Do it as an explicit step 0 before `record-cli.sh`, using the seed's reset
(which deletes the hero via `DELETE /admin/users/<id>` → cascades, then
recreates the hero + Potemkin workspaces):

```bash
devenv --quiet -O dotenv.enable:bool false shell -- node --experimental-strip-types \
  src/frontend/e2e-tests/demo/demo-seed.ts --reset
```

`record-cli.sh`'s Scene 2 prep also calls `--reset`, but do NOT rely on that
alone — run the destroy consciously and explicitly every time.
