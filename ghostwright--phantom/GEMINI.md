## The Cardinal Rule

**TypeScript is plumbing. The Agent SDK is the brain.**

The Agent SDK (Opus 4.7) has full computer access: Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep, WebSearch, Agent tools. It can understand natural language, read code, explore repos, detect tech stacks, clone repos, install packages, write configs, and reason about anything.

TypeScript handles: starting processes, routing messages, managing sessions, storing data, serving HTTP endpoints, tracking state. Mechanical, deterministic work.

If you find yourself writing a function that does something the agent can do better - STOP. Write a prompt instead.

**Anti-patterns (never do these):**
- `detectJsFrameworks()` - the agent reads package.json and knows
- `parseRepoUrls()` with regex - the agent understands natural language
- `classifyUserIntent()` - the agent understands context
- `extractFactsFromText()` as regex - use LLM judges (already built)
- Structured question state machines - the agent has natural conversations
- Hardcoded detection of languages/databases/tools - the agent reads code

**The only exception:** heuristic fallbacks for when the LLM is unavailable (API down). These are clearly marked with "HEURISTIC FALLBACK" comments in the codebase.

## Architecture Overview

Message flow: Slack message -> SlackChannel adapter -> ChannelRouter -> SessionManager (find/create session) -> PromptAssembler (base + role + evolved config + memory context) -> AgentRuntime.query() (Opus 4.7 with full tools) -> response -> ChannelRouter -> Slack thread reply. Web chat uses the same flow: POST /chat/sessions/:id/message -> SSE stream of wire frames -> React client renders in real time. Two separate transcripts (wire-format message store for the client, SDK conversation for the agent) are kept in sync.

After each session: EvolutionEngine runs 6-step reflection pipeline -> 5-gate validation -> approved changes applied to phantom-config/ -> version bumped.

MCP flow: External client -> /mcp endpoint -> bearer auth -> MCP Server -> tool execution (some route through AgentRuntime for full Opus brain).

## Key Design Decisions

**Qdrant over LanceDB:** WAL durability with crash recovery. Native hybrid search (dense + BM25 sparse vectors). Named vectors for separate embedding spaces. Mmap mode for low memory. TypeScript REST client works with Bun (no NAPI addon risk).

**Sonnet as default judge model:** The evolution pipeline uses Sonnet as the default judge model for safety-critical gates. Cross-model evaluation avoids self-enhancement bias: the main agent runs on Opus, so judges run on Sonnet. Operators may opt into Opus judges for deeper reasoning at higher cost. Safety/constitution gates use triple-judge minority veto (one dissent blocks the change).

**Factory pattern for MCP servers:** The SDK connects each MCP server instance to one transport and rejects reuse. In-process MCP servers must be recreated per query() call. The registries they wrap are singletons, but the MCP server wrapper is new each time.

**Docker socket mount (not DinD):** Agent creates sibling containers via the host Docker daemon. Docker-in-Docker requires --privileged mode. This matches CI systems (GitHub Actions, Jenkins). The socket is root-equivalent access, which is acceptable because the agent already has full shell access.

**Tailwind v4 Browser CDN:** No build step for agent-generated pages. The agent creates HTML files in public/ and they render immediately. Theme variable declarations go in `<style type="text/tailwindcss">`, custom CSS referencing those variables goes in a plain `<style>` block.

**Non-root Docker user:** Claude Code CLI hard-exits when --dangerously-skip-permissions is used by a root process. The container runs as the phantom user with Docker socket access via group_add.

## Development Standards

- TypeScript strict mode. No `any`. No `@ts-ignore`.
- Biome for lint and format. Run `bun run lint` before committing.
- Files under 300 lines. Split if approaching 250.
- Named exports only. No default exports. No barrel files.
- Explicit return types on all public functions.
- Zod for all external input validation.
- Tests with bun:test and mocked dependencies for unit tests.
- Error messages must be human-readable and actionable.
- Comments explain WHY, never WHAT.
- No em dashes in any text, copy, or output. Use commas, periods, or regular dashes.
- No unnecessary abstractions. No premature optimization.

## Deployment

**Docker (recommended for new installs):**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ghostwright/phantom.git && cd phantom
cp .env.example .env   # add ANTHROPIC_API_KEY + Slack tokens
docker compose up -d
```

**Bare metal (Specter VMs, production):**
```bash
rsync -az --exclude='config' --exclude='phantom-config' --exclude='data' --exclude='.env*' --exclude='*.db' src/ config/ package.json specter@<IP>:/home/specter/phantom/
ssh specter@<IP> "cd /home/specter/phantom && bun install --production"
# Restart the process (systemd or nohup)
```

Full checklist at `docs/deploy-checklist.md`. Both modes are first-class.

Production deployments are managed internally. Do NOT modify production deployments without explicit approval. Code-only updates use rsync with --exclude for config/phantom-config/data.

### Deploy gotchas (read before any Docker redeploy or fresh VM provision)

For a **fresh VM from scratch with the latest local source**, follow `docs/deploy-new-phantom.md`. It captures every trap we have hit including stale SSH host keys, the `phantom-config/` build-context requirement on first deploy, pre-chowning ALL named volumes to uid 999 before the first `docker compose up`, the `claude login` flow over docker exec, the iTerm paste-into-TUI workaround, and the Slack token sharing trap.

For an **update to an existing Docker deployment**, three specific traps to never repeat:

**1. rsync with multiple trailing-slash sources merges into the target root.** Do NOT pass several `dir/` sources to a single target. The contents collapse together and `--delete` then wipes the original directory names. Always one rsync per source directory:

```bash
rsync -az --delete src/     specter@<IP>:/home/specter/phantom/src/
rsync -az --delete public/  specter@<IP>:/home/specter/phantom/public/
rsync -az --delete scripts/ specter@<IP>:/home/specter/phantom/scripts/
```

**2. Alpine overlays into the `phantom_public` (or any phantom) volume must chown to uid 999.** Phantom inside the container runs as `uid=999(phantom)`. The host source files are owned by `specter` at uid 1000, and `cp -av` preserves numeric ownership. Without the chown, the volume ends up owned by uid 1000 and the phantom container cannot write to `/app/public` (or wherever the volume mounts). Bake the chown into the overlay:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -v phantom_phantom_public:/dst \
  -v /home/specter/phantom/public:/src \
  alpine sh -c 'cp -av /src/. /dst/ && chown -R 999:999 /dst'
```

**3. New Docker volumes are root-owned by default.** When `docker compose up` creates a fresh named volume, the volume root is owned by `root:root`, not by the container's user. Phantom's first-boot entrypoint then crashes with `Permission denied` when it tries to seed skills, plugins, or phantom-config into the volume. **Pre-create and pre-chown every named volume BEFORE the first `docker compose up`** on a fresh VM:

```bash
for vol in phantom_phantom_claude phantom_phantom_evolved phantom_phantom_data phantom_phantom_public; do
  docker volume create $vol
  docker run --rm -v $vol:/dst alpine chown -R 999:999 /dst
done
```

Verify after every deploy with `docker exec phantom sh -c 'touch /app/public/_w && rm /app/public/_w && echo OK'`. If write fails, repeat the chown step on the affected volume.

## Known Bugs

1. **Onboarding re-fires on restart (LOW):** When evolution generation is 0, the intro DM sends again on restart. Needs an "intro_sent" flag in SQLite.

## Key Files to Read First

| File | Why |
|------|-----|
| `src/index.ts` | Main wiring. How everything connects. |
| `src/agent/prompt-assembler.ts` | The system prompt. How identity, role, evolved config, and memory are composed. |
| `src/agent/runtime.ts` | How the Agent SDK is called. Session management, hooks, cost tracking. |
| `src/evolution/engine.ts` | The self-evolution pipeline. The core differentiator. |
| `src/channels/slack.ts` | Primary channel. Owner access control, threading, reactions. |
| `src/mcp/server.ts` | MCP server setup. Tool registration, auth integration. |
| `src/memory/system.ts` | Memory coordinator. How the three tiers connect. |
| `src/chat/http.ts` | Web chat backend. SSE streaming, session routing, API handlers. |
| `src/core/server.ts` | HTTP server. Routes, health endpoint, version. |
| `config/roles/swe.yaml` | SWE role template. Onboarding questions, tools, evolution focus. |
| `phantom-config/constitution.md` | Immutable principles the evolution engine cannot modify. |
| `Dockerfile` | Multi-stage build, non-root user, tini, health check. |
| `docker-compose.yaml` | Three-service stack with named volumes and socket mount. |

## What NOT to Do

- **Don't hardcode what the agent can do.** This is the Cardinal Rule. If TypeScript is doing something the agent can do (detect frameworks, parse URLs, classify intent), you are violating the core principle.
- **Don't modify frozen Specter templates.** The cloud-init, systemd unit, and Caddyfile in Specter are shared across all deployments. Changes there affect every VM.
- **Don't run as root in Docker.** Claude Code CLI rejects --dangerously-skip-permissions as root. The non-root phantom user with group_add for Docker socket is the correct pattern.
- **Don't use inline handlers for dynamic tools.** The "inline" handler type (new Function) was removed in Phase A for RCE prevention. Only "shell" and "script" handlers are allowed.
- **Don't store secrets in phantom-config/ or memory.** Evolved config is version-controlled and visible. Secrets go in .env files only.
- **Don't commit .env files.** All .env variants are gitignored. Use .env.example as reference.
- **Don't put var() references in text/tailwindcss blocks.** Tailwind v4 Browser CDN's parser breaks on var(--color-*) inside complex CSS values like linear-gradient(). Declarations go in tailwindcss, references go in plain CSS.
- **Don't reuse MCP server instances across query() calls.** The SDK connects each instance to one transport. Create fresh instances per call (factory pattern).
- **Don't leak process.env to subprocesses.** Dynamic tool handlers use buildSafeEnv() which passes only PATH, HOME, LANG, TERM, TOOL_INPUT. Never pass API keys to child processes.
- **Don't modify docker-compose.yaml or Dockerfile from inside the agent.** That is infrastructure managed by the operator.
