# Reels To Knowledge Base

Turns saved Instagram reels and carousels, and saved X posts, into a
searchable, actionable knowledge base: SQLite + FTS5 for the pipeline, an
Obsidian vault as the readable view.

## Why the pipeline is split

Everything mechanical runs locally and free — download, frame sampling,
transcription, OCR. Only the judgement step needs a model, and it runs on the
Claude Code subscription rather than per-token API billing.

```
1. rkb prepare   download, sample frames, transcribe, OCR      (plain Python)
2. extraction    read the context, write structure back        (you)
3. rkb vault     render the database as markdown               (plain Python)
```

SQLite is the source of truth. The vault is a generated view, so `rkb vault` is
safe to re-run after every batch.

## Where posts come from

Three doors, all landing in the same `posts` table at status `new`:

```
rkb import      the Meta export           (Instagram, bulk backfill)
rkb bookmarks   the live X bookmark feed  (X, bulk, needs cookies)
rkb add <url>   one link, any platform    (either; also what the bot calls)
```

Two front doors put `add` within reach of your phone, both landing in the same
place. `rkb telegram` runs a bot (stdlib only, no library): forward a post from
the share sheet and it lands here. `rkb ingest --serve` is the same thing over
HTTP, for an iOS Shortcut or a curl.

**A front door is not a stage.** Neither one downloads, transcribes or reads
anything. Saving costs milliseconds; preparing costs a video download, ffmpeg,
whisper and OCR on this machine — so they are separate acts with separate
triggers. A forwarded link lands at `new` and waits. Draining the queue is
deliberate: `rkb prepare`, `/prepare` in the chat, or the button the bot puts
on its reply. The extraction pass is still yours in Claude Code, on the
subscription, rather than an LLM provider billing per token.

One batch runs at a time (`worker.run_batch`). Two would fight over the same
rows and fetch in parallel, which is what `prepare`'s sleep exists to prevent.

`rkb/platforms.py` is the only place a platform is described. Adding a third
source is a row in that table plus a branch in `acquire`, not a new pipeline.

## Your job: the extraction pass

When asked to extract, process or ingest a batch:

1. `./bin/rkb pending -n 25` — list posts awaiting extraction.
2. For each, read `<media_dir>/context.md`. It contains the caption, the
   transcript, and **the verbatim OCR text of every frame or slide**. A
   text-only X post has none of those: `media_kind` is `text`, and the tweet
   text under `## Tweet text` is the entire post. There are no frames to open
   and nothing is missing — do not file it as under-prepared.
3. Read images from `<media_dir>/frames/` only when the OCR is ambiguous — a
   blurred URL, a layout you can't reconstruct from text alone. OCR is cheaper
   and more literal than a vision read; prefer it.
4. Emit one JSON object per post and write them back in one call:
   `./bin/rkb record batch.json`
5. `./bin/rkb vault` to refresh Obsidian.
6. `./bin/rkb triage` to see what carries no payload — anything without a link
   lands in the user's review queue, which is theirs to decide, not yours.

### Output schema

```json
[
  {
    "shortcode": "Dbm7X5IAuEe",
    "summary": "one line — what this post is actually about",
    "detail": "2–4 sentences: what the tool/technique does and how it was used",
    "tools": ["Claude Code", "mlx-whisper"],
    "links": ["https://github.com/owner/repo"],
    "prompt": null,
    "tags": ["agents", "local-llm"],
    "actionable": "clone the repo and run the example, or null",
    "confidence": "high"
  }
]
```

## Rules that matter

**The link is the payload.** Hunt for the repo or URL before anything else —
check the OCR text, every frame including the last, and the caption. Every post
you leave without a link goes to the user's review queue, where they read the
raw OCR themselves, so an empty `links` is a claim that you looked and found
nothing.

**Do not compose prompts.** The verbatim on-screen text is already captured in
`ocr_text` and rendered in full on every vault note and dashboard card — the
user reads it there and lifts what they want. Leave `prompt` null. Do not
rewrite a checklist into a "drill", add framing, reorder items, or drop half of
it to make a nicer artefact. Your job is to find the link and describe the post,
not to design study material out of it.

**When the address bar is covered, read the chrome around it.** A screen
recording usually leaks the repo owner somewhere else in the frame: a browser
tab title, an adjacent tab, a window title, a terminal prompt, a git remote, a
Docker image name, a GitHub sidebar avatar. This is a real miss from the first
pass — FreeLLMAPI's owner (`tashfeenahmed`) was legible in a neighbouring tab
while the URL bar sat behind a caption overlay, and the post was filed as "no
link". Exhaust the frame before declaring a link unrecoverable.

**Resolve a named tool to its canonical repo** when you are certain
(`Appsmith` → `https://github.com/appsmithorg/appsmith`). If you are not
certain, leave `links` empty and set `confidence: medium`.

**Never invent.** A missing link is recoverable from the review dashboard; a
wrong one silently sends the user nowhere. `rkb record` HEAD-checks every URL,
repairs OCR truncations (`.../network/dependen` → `.../network/dependents`) and
drops dead ones — but it only proves a URL *resolves*, not that it points at the
right project. That part is still on you.

**A comment-wall is not automatically a dead end.** "Comment X and I'll send the
link" often gates a *guide* while the tool itself is public. Appsmith's setup
guide was gated; Appsmith is a 40k-star public repo. Judge what is actually
withheld.

**Trust OCR over the transcript for names.** Whisper mis-hears tool names — it
rendered `ntfy` as "Notify". When the two disagree on a name or URL, the frames
win.

**`tools` and `tags` are graph vocabulary, not description.** They become hub
notes, and the hubs link to each other by co-occurrence — that concept map is
the point of the vault (`rkb/concepts.py` builds it; the graph view shows only
`Tools/` and `Topics/`). Three consequences for how you write them:

- **Spell them the same way every time.** A name only becomes a hub once two
  posts share it, so "Claude Code" spelled two ways is two singletons and
  therefore no hub at all — the connection is silently lost, not merely
  mis-styled. Check what already exists: `ls vault/Tools vault/Topics`.
- **Reuse tags across the library.** `rag`, `agents`, `mcp`, `local-llm`,
  `evals`, `prompt-engineering`, `automation`, `self-hosted` earn their place; a
  phrase that describes one post contributes nothing to a map.
  `sqlite3 data/reels.db "SELECT DISTINCT value FROM extractions, json_each(tags)"`
- **Don't reach for the near-universal one.** A tag on more than half the
  library is dropped from the graph as a stopword — it co-occurs with everything
  and so separates nothing. `open-source` already went that way here; tagging
  everything `ai` would too.

**Respect the user's own filing.** `collection` is a category they assigned by
hand in Instagram; let it inform tags rather than contradict it.

**`actionable` is the payoff field.** The concrete next step ("clone X and run
the demo notebook", "sign up for the beta"), or null if the post is commentary.

Batch 20–30 posts per session.

## Notes

- **The Telegram bot's allowlist is not optional.** Anyone who finds the bot's
  username can message it, and ingesting starts downloads on this machine, so
  an unset `RKB_TELEGRAM_ALLOW` refuses everything and replies with the chat id
  to add. Do not default it open.
- **On X, cookies are not optional.** X serves a logged-out client almost
  nothing, so `bookmarks` refuses to run without them and `prepare` fails with
  that hint rather than a generic download error. `RKB_X_BROWSER` /
  `RKB_X_COOKIES` override the Instagram settings for X only, which is what you
  want when the two accounts live in different browsers; unset, they fall back
  to `RKB_BROWSER` / `RKB_COOKIES`.
- **A tweet with no media is not a failed download.** `media_kind='text'`, no
  frames, no transcript, no OCR — the text is the post. `prepare` only raises
  when a tweet has neither media nor text.
- **Instagram cookies are opt-in and usually unnecessary.** Reels download anonymously,
  which keeps the account out of the loop entirely. Image and carousel `/p/`
  posts do hit a login wall — for those, grant the terminal Full Disk Access and
  use `RKB_BROWSER=safari`. No browser extension needed.
- `prepare` sleeps between downloads on purpose. Bulk-hammering Instagram is
  what gets accounts flagged.
- Failures never abort a batch; they're recorded on the row and retried with
  `prepare --retry`.
- Vault images are hard links in `vault/attachments/<shortcode>-NN.jpg`, one per
  slide or keyframe, embedded as `![[<shortcode>-NN.jpg|300]]`. The filename is
  the only join back to the post; there is no attachments table. Do not go back
  to a symlink — Obsidian does not index through one, and every embed silently
  breaks. A carousel's gallery comes from the downloaded slides, never from
  `frames/`, which is capped at `MAX_FRAMES` and would drop over half the
  slides on the longer listicle posts.
- **Source notes are filed by platform**: `vault/Reels/` for Instagram,
  `vault/Tweets/` for X, from `platforms.folders()`. The split is cosmetic —
  `Tools/` and `Topics/` hubs span both, so the concept map stays one map. Note
  titles are unique across the whole library, not per folder. Every post note
  still carries `reel: true`, which is what `Library.base` filters on; read it
  as "an rkb post note", and filter on `platform` when you want one source.
- `vault/Repos.md` and `vault/Prompts.md` are derived views, not stores.
  `Repos.md` normalises every `github.com` URL to `owner/repo`, so a repo seen
  in three posts is one row. `Prompts.md` is *kept, and carrying no payload
  link* — there is no `prompt` flag to read, because `extractions.prompt` is
  null by contract and the dashboard writes the same `reviewed='kept'` for
  "prompt is the payload" as for a plain keep. Do not invent a flag to make the
  set narrower; change the rule in `vault.prompt_posts()` if it needs changing.
- `rkb vault` regenerates every note it owns; never hand-edit one. Fix the
  database or the renderer. `rkb graph` is only needed when the vocabulary
  shifts enough to change the clusters, not after every batch.
- **Never edit `.obsidian/*.json` while Obsidian is running.** It holds that
  state in memory and writes it back on exit, discarding the edit without a
  word. `rkb graph` refuses to run in that situation; do the same by hand.
- Anything typed below the `rkb:end` marker in a vault note survives
  regeneration. Notes rkb didn't write are never touched.
- **The review queue is the HTML dashboard**, `rkb dashboard --serve`. The vault
  can host the same queue as note properties (`RKB_VAULT_REVIEW=1`, then
  `rkb sync`), but it is off by default: two surfaces for one decision is one
  too many. Do not turn it on unprompted.
- **Never record a review decision yourself.** The queue exists for questions
  you already declined to guess at. A link you found goes through `rkb record`.
