# CLAUDE.md

Context for future Claude sessions working on this repo.

**Keep this file SHORT.** It is loaded into every session's context, so it holds
only operational rules and pointers. Deep dives — postmortems, design rationale,
annotated source trees — live in `docs/dev/` and in the specs. When a change
earns a written lesson, add it to the matching `docs/dev/*.md` file (or the
feature's spec), never here; this file grew to 2,456 lines once and was cut back
to what you are reading. A new section here needs a reason a pointer cannot serve.

## What this is

`platypusgit` — cross-platform, developer-focused git desktop app. Tauri 2 (Rust) backend + React/TS frontend. Dev-first TortoiseGit alternative with "extreme usability" as north star. Standalone GUI only — shell integration (Finder/Explorer overlays) out of scope.

## Detailed docs — read the matching one BEFORE working in its area

- `docs/dev/architecture.md` — the annotated backend + frontend source trees:
  every module, command, feature directory, and the traps between them. The map
  of the codebase; start here for any non-trivial change.
- `docs/dev/testing.md` — the four test layers, headless e2e in Docker, CI
  workflows and gates, e2e sharding, the `test/` doc invariants.
- `docs/dev/frontend.md` — diff rendering, the paged log, navigation model,
  state management (multi-repo tabs), styling/design system, PGSelect,
  resizable panes, dialogs, file lists, drag and drop.
- `docs/dev/backend.md` — errors, forge tokens, the rebase engine, network ops
  and credentials, signing, stash, spawning processes, bisect, async/threading.
- `docs/dev/distribution.md` — `pgit` CLI packaging per channel, the launch
  detach, Tauri permissions.
- `docs/dev/releasing.md` — what a version number means and when to bump which
  part, the cut-a-release runbook (changelog lands on `main` FIRST), and the
  prerelease-promotion traps. Read it before tagging anything.
- `docs/superpowers/specs/` + `docs/superpowers/plans/` — approved design docs
  and implementation plans per feature (`ls` for the current set). New feature
  beyond MVP slice → write new spec + plan there first.

`test/docs.test.ts` fails the build when the doc set falls behind the tree
(commands, backend modules, feature directories) — see `docs/dev/testing.md`.

## Toolchain

- **Node 22** + **pnpm** (at `~/Library/pnpm`). Not npm, not yarn.
- **Rust stable** via rustup (`~/.cargo/bin`).
- Assistant's Bash tool does not inherit interactive shell rc → prepend `export PATH="$HOME/Library/pnpm:$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"` when running `pnpm` or `cargo`.

## Common commands

```bash
pnpm install                                # frontend + tauri-cli deps
pnpm tauri dev                              # run app (first build ~2 min, reruns ~10s)
pnpm tsc --noEmit                           # type-check
pnpm vite build                             # bundle frontend only
cargo check --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml
cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml
pnpm tauri build                            # production bundle (.msi/.dmg/.deb/.AppImage)
pnpm tauri build --no-sign                  # ...without updater signing (see note below)
pnpm test                                   # vitest (unit logic + component tests + doc invariants)
pnpm test:e2e:docker                        # e2e — THE way to run e2e (headless, same stack as CI)
pnpm test:e2e:docker run --spec e2e/specs/X.e2e.ts   # ...one spec against this worktree's snapshot
pnpm exec tsc -p e2e/tsconfig.json --noEmit # e2e typecheck gate (root tsc excludes e2e/)
```

**Local production builds need the updater signing key.** `tauri.conf.json`
sets an updater pubkey + `createUpdaterArtifacts`, and a pubkey with no private
key is a **hard error** on any target producing an updater artifact. Export
`TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY` (+ `_PASSWORD`) or build with `--no-sign`. CI passes
both from repo secrets.

## Testing — the operational rules

Four layers (details + CI shape in `docs/dev/testing.md`):

- **Rust backend integration** — `cargo test` against real temp repos.
- **Frontend pure logic + component tests** — `pnpm test` (vitest project
  `unit`, jsdom + mocks from `src/test/setup.ts`).
- **Doc/tree invariants** — `pnpm test` (vitest project `docs`, node env,
  reads `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/dev/`, `src-tauri/`, `e2e/`, `.github/`).
- **E2E** — WebdriverIO specs in `e2e/specs/` driving the real binary.

**E2E always runs in Docker (`pnpm test:e2e:docker …`) — never natively, never
in a UI window.** A native run pops a real WKWebView window, steals focus, is
flaky and slow, and does not predict the CI gate. The one exception is a
genuinely WKWebView-specific question the user explicitly asks for. Run e2e
only when DONE developing a change, and only the spec file(s) relevant to what
you touched — CI runs the full suite. After a `src/` or `src-tauri/` change,
rebuild the snapshot first: `pnpm test:e2e:docker build`, then
`pnpm test:e2e:docker run --spec e2e/specs/<file>.e2e.ts`. Never rely on a
stale snapshot. One cold container build at a time across ALL worktrees
(memory), different worktrees may otherwise run concurrently.

**Before writing or debugging any e2e spec, read the `e2e-testing` project
skill** (`.claude/skills/e2e-testing/SKILL.md`).

## Architecture in one screen

Backend (`src-tauri/src/`): thin Tauri command handlers (`commands/`, one file
per area) over a `GitBackend` trait (`git/mod.rs`) implemented by
`Libgit2Backend` (`git/libgit2.rs`, shelling out to real git where libgit2
falls short). One error type crosses IPC (`error.rs::AppError`). Process
spawning only via `proc.rs`; forge (GitHub/GitLab) integration under `forge/`.

Frontend (`src/`): screens (`screens/`) + per-feature Zustand stores and
components (`features/*/`), an in-house design system (`design/`, NOT
`components/ui/`), shared logic in `lib/` (typed `invoke` wrappers in
`lib/tauri.ts` — never call `invoke` directly). `@/` → `src/` path alias; use it.

**Four near-identical filename pairs do different jobs** — check before
editing: `git/signing.rs` (cryptography) vs `git/signature.rs` (identity/
sign-off); `src-tauri/src/update.rs` (engine) vs `commands/update.rs`
(handlers); `src-tauri/src/cli.rs` (pgit launch) vs `git/cli.rs` (CliBackend);
`src-tauri/src/terminal.rs` (pty sessions) vs `commands/terminal.rs` (handlers).

The full annotated trees are in `docs/dev/architecture.md`.

### Adding a new git op (standard path)

1. Add method to `GitBackend` trait (`src-tauri/src/git/mod.rs`).
2. Implement in `Libgit2Backend` (`libgit2.rs`). Stub in `CliBackend` too (`NotImplemented`) — keeps trait shape exercised.
3. Tauri command in right `commands/<area>.rs`. Keep thin. Wrap git2 calls in `tokio::task::spawn_blocking` (libgit2 is sync).
4. Register command name in `invoke_handler![…]` in `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`.
5. Add TS type to `src/lib/types.ts`, wrapper to `src/lib/tauri.ts`.
6. Wire into relevant feature's Zustand store.
7. Add it to the `commands/<area>.rs` entry in the backend tree in
   `docs/dev/architecture.md` — `test/docs.test.ts` fails the build otherwise,
   and a command nobody can find is a command that gets written twice.

## Conventions — the load-bearing rules

Each rule's full story (why, traps, tests that pin it) is in the named doc.

- **Errors:** every IPC-crossing fn returns `AppResult<T>`; add `AppError`
  variants, never stringify. TS `AppError` union stays 1:1 with the Rust enum,
  updated in the same commit — and a UNIT variant needs prose in
  `appErrorDetail`, or a banner shows the enum's own spelling.
  `test/appErrors.test.ts` fails the build for both. (`docs/dev/backend.md`)
- **One error banner — `PGErrorBanner`** from `@/design`. A user never reads a
  `kind`: the bold prefix is written prose or nothing (`errorBannerLabel` is
  `Partial` on purpose), and the text is `pre-wrap` so git's multi-line advice
  survives. `test/appErrors.test.ts` + `error-banner.test.tsx` fail the build
  for a new surface that spells the enum. (`docs/dev/frontend.md`)
- **One issue reporter — `features/report/`.** `report.ts` stays PURE and
  `fileReport.ts` owns the side effects, because `PGErrorBoundary` mounts ABOVE
  `PGDialogHost` and therefore CANNOT open the dialog — it takes an `onReport`
  callback wired in `main.tsx`, and `PGErrorBanner` takes one for the same
  reason (`src/design/` imports no `@/lib/tauri`). The log travels by
  CLIPBOARD, never in the URL (`issues/new?body=` 414s far below
  `TAIL_CAP_BYTES`, so `issueUrl` caps at `MAX_URL_LEN` by trimming the
  summary), copy happens strictly BEFORE open, and the preview shows the exact
  string that will be copied — the opt-out checkboxes filter the clipboard, not
  just the display. Nothing is ever sent: the app writes the clipboard and
  hands a URL to the user's browser. (`docs/dev/frontend.md`)
- **Never `Command::new` outside `src-tauri/src/proc.rs`** — a guard test
  fails the build. Use the `proc::git*`/`proc::program*` constructors.
  (`docs/dev/backend.md`)
- **One credential path.** Network git ops go through
  `commands::net::run_git_authenticated`; frontend retries via `useRepoStore`'s
  exported `withAuthRetry`. Never a second auth path. Secrets travel in env,
  never argv; end option parsing with `--` before user-supplied values.
  (`docs/dev/backend.md`)
- **Forge tokens are NOT git credentials** — separate storage, separate types
  (`Secret`), no command returns a token. (`docs/dev/backend.md`)
- **"No telemetry, no account" is a build gate, not prose.** No analytics
  package in either dependency tree, no network call from `src/`, `ureq` only in
  the two disclosed call sites, and every hard-coded hostname on an allow-list
  with a written reason — `test/privacy.test.ts` +
  `src-tauri/tests/no_telemetry.rs`. Tripping one means changing what the README
  promises; do that deliberately, in the same commit. (`docs/dev/backend.md`)
- **A Microsoft Store install has NO update surface** — no check, no chip, no
  panel, no release link, no Settings control. `StoreManaged` gates the CHECK,
  not just the install: Store policy 10.2.5 makes *notifying* the violation, and
  v0.4.0 failed certification on it. Anything new that reads `UpdateCapability`
  gates on `may_check_for_updates` / `updatesManagedExternally`.
  (`docs/dev/distribution.md`)
- **One signing chain** (`libgit2.rs::sign_payload`) for commits AND tags; a
  signing failure creates nothing. (`docs/dev/backend.md`)
- **Never `window.confirm`/`window.prompt`** — `pgConfirm`/`pgPrompt`/`pgChoose`
  from `@/design`; every one of them reads a dismissal as "no answer", never as a
  choice. (`docs/dev/frontend.md`)
- **No native `<select>`/`<option>` in shipped `src/`** — `PGSelect`; a guard
  test enforces it. (`docs/dev/frontend.md`)
- **Design system lives in `src/design/`**, imported from `@/design`. Do NOT
  add `src/components/ui/`. Never hardcode the accent hue — CSS vars/theme
  tokens only. New list-row surfaces opt into UI density (`var(--row-step)`).
  (`docs/dev/frontend.md`)
- **Icons are `lucide-react` behind `PGIcon`** — `src/design/icons.tsx` is the
  ONLY file that may import it, and `PGIcon`'s `strokeWidth` is on a 16-unit
  grid (scaled to lucide's 24), so changing that scale re-weights every icon at
  once. `name` is `IconName | string` so a typo type-checks and renders a dashed
  square; `test/iconSet.test.ts` fails the build for a stray import AND for a
  call-site literal the union does not declare. (`docs/dev/frontend.md`)
- **Zustand per feature.** `useRepoStore` holds exactly ONE repository's state
  (the active tab's); a new per-repo field must join `RepoSlice`/`emptySlice`
  or tab switches leak state. Danger-op catch arms: `refreshAll()` first,
  `set({ error })` last. (`docs/dev/frontend.md`)
- **A new `NavIntent` kind must be routed in `AppShell`** — compile-enforced
  (`assertNever`) + `AppShell.navroutes.test.tsx`. (`docs/dev/frontend.md`)
- **A new long-running op joins `RepoActivity`**, and one that can raise a
  credential challenge lets `withAuthRetry` own its label (pass `{ key, label }`,
  never a `finally` at the call site — that clears while the password dialog is
  still open). `RepoActivity` is what produces the status line, the progress bar
  and the Cancel button; a private `busy` field only says which row is busy.
  It has TWO surfaces — the status bar and the history strip — and both render
  from `useActivityView`, which owns every decision about what is said; a third
  one lays out that hook rather than reading `activity` itself.
  (`docs/dev/frontend.md`)
- **Diff surfaces:** one row model (`flattenDiffRows`); gate text rendering on
  `isTextualDiff`, scroll by offset (never `scrollIntoView` under windowing),
  measure viewports with `lib/useViewportH`/`useElementSize` (read first,
  observe second — WebKitGTK has no `ResizeObserver`). New row markup keeps the
  selection split: code cell `.pg-selectable`, line numbers and `+`/`−` marker
  `user-select: none`. A selection cannot leave the rendered window, so copying a
  long range goes through `lib/diffCopy.ts` (`diff.copy` / the right-click menu),
  and `Mod+C` must keep declining to the native copy. The over-ceiling notice's
  SENTENCE and its ACTION are both shared (`oversizedDiffNotice` +
  `OversizedDiffAction`/`useDiffAnyway`) — a pane that grows its own is how a
  file starts behaving differently depending on where you opened it; the blob
  ceiling is `blob_ceiling`, raised per file and never removed.
  (`docs/dev/frontend.md`, `docs/dev/backend.md`)
- **One commit-message composition surface** — `features/commits/message/`
  (`useCommitComposer` + `CommitMessageBar`). A new way to compose message text
  joins it; it never grows a second surface beside it. The box stays plain text
  (the picker parses it back out), git's cleanup decides what is sent AND
  whether Commit is enabled, and nothing overwrites what the user typed.
  Comment stripping is SCOPED the way git scopes it: the box is `git commit -m`
  (a typed `#123 fix` commits as written) until `commit.template` seeds it.
  (`docs/dev/frontend.md`)
- **One committer-identity surface** — `features/commits/identity/`, rendered by
  Settings and by the commit panel. `NoSignature` is a FORM, not a banner: it
  lands in `useRepoStore`'s per-repo `noSignature`, and saving retries the
  commit. The write is global and the form names the file; per-repo identities
  (#233) add a scope control there, never a second form.
  (`docs/dev/frontend.md`)
- **Settings is a registry, not a screen** — every page under
  `features/settings/pages/` exports pure `meta` beside its component, so search
  matches without rendering. A new setting joins its page's `meta.cards[].rows`
  or `settings.index.test.tsx` fails the build; a word that lives only in a
  `hint` goes in `keywords`, because hints are `ReactNode` and are NOT indexed.
  The index reads `UpdateCapability`, so it gates on `updatesManagedExternally`
  like every other update surface. (`docs/dev/frontend.md`)
- **The log is paged** — `s.commits` is a prefix of history, never the answer
  to "does X exist / is X an ancestor"; ask the backend.
  (`docs/dev/frontend.md`)
- **Drag and drop:** pointer events via `features/dnd`, never HTML5 dnd; every
  drag has a keyboard equivalent. (`docs/dev/frontend.md`)
- **`git2::Repository` is `Send` not `Sync`** — wrap git2 work in
  `spawn_blocking`. Per-repo WRITES serialize on one cached handle; reads run
  concurrently on private handles (`git/repo_locks.rs`). `with_repo` is the
  exclusive/write path and `with_repo_read` the shared one — the `_mut` suffix
  is about libgit2's C signatures, NOT reads vs writes, and `with_repo` carries
  most of this backend's writes. An op joins the `_read` helpers only once
  established to write nothing. Verify and mutate under ONE lock acquisition
  (stash TOCTOU); never nest two lock helpers on one repository.
  (`docs/dev/backend.md`)
- **Tauri permissions:** shared set in `capabilities/default.json`; privileged
  ones (updater, e2e) stay in their scoped capability files. A new window label
  must match a pattern in that file's `windows` list (`pg-*` since #256) or the
  window silently has no permissions at all.
  (`docs/dev/distribution.md`)
- **There can be several repository windows** (`main`, `pg-1`, …) — so anything
  that is "the one live X on the ACTIVE repository" is keyed by WINDOW LABEL,
  never global, and anything the backend emits to "the app" picks a window
  instead of broadcasting. Two windows on one repository get two `RepoId`s on
  purpose; per-window session state hangs off `openReposKey`.
  (`docs/dev/frontend.md`)
- **The main window starts HIDDEN** (`"visible": false`) and the frontend shows
  it on React's first commit (`src/lib/revealWindow.tsx`) — that is what makes
  the app open already-drawn instead of flashing white. Delete the reveal and
  you ship a process with no UI, and **e2e cannot catch it**: WebDriver attaches
  to the webview, not the window, so the suite passes green against an invisible
  app. `test/startupPaint.test.ts` plus a `SHOW_WINDOW_FALLBACK_MS` thread in
  `lib.rs` are the guards; the window and document background colours track
  `--bg-0` and fail the build when they drift. Startup slowness is NOT the
  bundle — the 1.4 MB entry compiles in ~15ms. (`docs/dev/distribution.md`)

## Things deliberately NOT in codebase

- Shell integration / Finder / Explorer overlays (out of scope).
- Custom icons — Tauri defaults for now. Replace before first release.
- Code signing config for bundles (distinct from the *updater* signing key
  above, and from git object signing, which is a feature).

## Known placeholders

- **Bundle identifier** in `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` is `com.platypusgit.app` — placeholder. User will finalize; changing later orphans installed instances, so don't auto-change without asking.

## Commit style

Match existing log:
- `feat(scope): …` / `fix(scope): …` / `test: …` / `docs: …` / `chore: …`
- Short imperative subject, under 72 chars.
- Optional body with **Why:** for non-obvious decisions.
- Trailing `Co-Authored-By: Claude …` when assistant drove the commit.

Do not create empty / merge commits — a rebase merge can replay neither. Every
commit on a branch lands on `main` as written, so no `wip` / `fixup!` subjects
survive to the PR. Do not amend published commits without asking.

## Branching & merge workflow

- **Never commit directly to `main`.** Branch first: `feat/...`, `fix/...`, `chore/...`, `docs/...`.
- **Always work in a dedicated git worktree, never the primary checkout.** Multiple assistant sessions run against this repo at once; sharing one working directory collides (competing index/HEAD, a rebase-in-progress from another session, `localStorage`-clearing e2e runs). Create the branch and its worktree together off latest `main`: `git fetch origin && git worktree add -b <type>/<slug> .claude/worktrees/<slug> origin/main`. Do all edits, builds, and tests there; remove it with `git worktree remove` when the PR is merged. Read-only analysis still gets its own worktree (`--detach origin/main`) so it never touches another session's state.
- Work as a series of small, focused commits on the feature branch (Conventional Commits throughout). **Each one lands on `main` on its own** — see the next bullets — so every commit is a public commit.
- When the branch does need updating, **rebase onto `main`**, not merge `main` in — no merge commits on the branch. Rebase-and-merge cannot replay a merge commit, so the merge itself now enforces what used to be convention.
- Integrate via **rebase and merge** (`gh pr merge <N> --rebase`) — the `main` ruleset (id `18319179`) gates the method through `allowed_merge_methods`, which must list `rebase` (verify with `gh api repos/:owner/:repo/rulesets/18319179`), alongside `required_linear_history`, `non_fast_forward`, and no branch deletion. GitHub replays every commit on the branch onto the `main` tip, so `main` gets **N commits per PR** with fresh SHAs — linear by construction.
- **Curate the branch's commits before merging; do NOT squash them into one.** `git rebase -i <pinned origin/main sha>` to fold fixups, drop `wip`, and reword subjects — what that list shows is exactly what `main` will read, and there is no second chance to clean it up. The old `git reset --soft origin/main` squash-to-one step is gone, and with it the trap of that reset reading an `origin/main` another session had already advanced.
- **The PR title is no longer a commit message.** A rebase merge writes no merge commit, so nothing carries the PR title and GitHub appends no `(#N)`; `gh pr merge`'s `--subject`/`--body` have nothing to title. Reference the PR/issue in the commit bodies you write on the branch if you want that link in `git log` — the PR title and body still drive the PR page and issue auto-closing.
- **No rebase-before-merge requirement.** `required_linear_history` is satisfied by the rebase merge itself (GitHub replays the commits onto the current `main` tip), and the required `e2e-linux` check is non-strict, so a branch that is merely *behind* `main` merges fine. **Merge as soon as GitHub reports the PR mergeable** (`gh pr view <N> --json mergeable,mergeStateStatus`). Rebase locally only when there's a reason: GitHub reports conflicts (`mergeable: CONFLICTING`), or your change interacts with something that landed on `main` since and you want CI to run against it.
- Resolve conflicts by rebasing onto `origin/main` (`git fetch origin && git rebase origin/main`), then force-push (`--force-with-lease`).
- Branch and open a PR even for assistant-driven work — don't push straight to `main`.
- `main` may be checked out by a worktree under `.claude/worktrees/` (other assistant sessions). Then `git checkout main` and `gh pr merge --delete-branch`'s local cleanup fail with "'main' is already used by worktree" — the remote merge still succeeds. Recover with `git checkout --detach origin/main`, delete the branch manually, and leave the other worktree alone.
