# Conducty

AI Workflow Orchestrator for Claude Code — systems-level orchestration of agents with per-plan cycles, tracer-first execution, calibrated review, and continuous improvement. **The context engine is an Obsidian vault.**

## The Context Engine

Conducty's plans, designs, project context, improvements, failure patterns, metrics, and prompt logs all live in an **Obsidian vault** at `$CONDUCTY_VAULT` (default `~/Obsidian/Conducty/`). Every note is wikilinked to its peers — designs link to the plans that consume them, plans link to the context they loaded and the improvements they're testing, failure patterns link to the prompts that surfaced them. Future plans navigate this graph rather than re-grepping a flat history.

**Read [[conducty-obsidian]] before reading or writing any state.** It defines the vault location, naming, frontmatter, link conventions, and indexes.

> [!important] Per plan, not per day
> Conducty runs **per plan**, not per day. Multiple plans per day are normal. Plan notes are timestamped: `Plan YYYY-MM-DD HHmm [Topic].md`. The same applies to designs and improvements. Accumulating notes (`Failure Patterns`, `Metrics`, `Prompt Log`) are singular files appended to over time.

## Skills

Claude Code discovers Conducty skills from `~/.claude/skills/` after running `./install-claude-code.sh`. Each skill is a folder with a `SKILL.md` file that Claude loads on demand based on its `description` trigger.

| [[conducty-vault-graph]] | maintenance | "vault audit", "vault health", weekly hygiene |

## Vault Layout (recap)

Vault is **nested by category** — per-instance notes get a directory, per-project context lives under `Context/{Project}/`, accumulators live under `Accumulators/`. Wikilinks resolve by basename across all subfolders, so directory placement is purely organizational. See [[conducty-obsidian]] for the full layout reference.

Per-instance notes (timestamped) — directory + filename pattern:

- `Plans/Plan YYYY-MM-DD HHmm [Topic].md`
- `Designs/Design YYYY-MM-DD HHmm {Topic}.md`
- `Improvements/Improvement YYYY-MM-DD HHmm.md`
- `Code Reviews/Code Review YYYY-MM-DD HHmm.md`
- `Ship Reports/Ship Report YYYY-MM-DD HHmm.md`

Project context is a **sub-graph** under `Context/{Project}/` — one hub plus several slices (see [[conducty-context]]):

- `Context/{Project}/Context {Project}.md` (hub)
- `Context/{Project}/Context {Project} Architecture.md`, `... Conventions.md`, `... Invariants.md`, `... Hotspots.md`, `... Tests.md`, `... Glossary.md`
- `Context/{Project}/Modules/Context {Project} {Module}.md` (per bounded-context, optional)
- `Context/{Project}/Refreshes/Context Refresh {Project} YYYY-MM-DD HHmm.md` (per refresh)

Indexes:

- `Conducty Index.md` (vault root)
- `Indexes/Plans Index.md`, `Indexes/Designs Index.md`, `Indexes/Context Index.md`, `Indexes/Improvements Index.md`

Accumulating notes (singular files, prepend new entries):

- `Accumulators/Failure Patterns.md`
- `Accumulators/Metrics.md`
- `Accumulators/Prompt Log.md`

## Claude Code Tooling

Conducty skills assume Claude Code's native tools:

- **Task tool** — dispatch implementer/reviewer subagents (used by [[conducty-execute]]). Pass `isolation: "worktree"` for automatic worktree handling, or use [[conducty-worktrees]] for explicit named worktrees.
- **Read / Write / Edit** — file operations (prefer Edit on existing notes; Write only for new ones)
- **Bash** — verification commands, git, test runners, `mkdir`/`ls` against the vault
- **Grep / Glob** — codebase exploration during [[conducty-context]] and [[conducty-debug]], vault navigation in [[conducty-plan]]
- **TaskCreate / TaskUpdate** — in-session progress tracking (separate from vault plan notes)

## Configuration

The vault path is resolved from `$CONDUCTY_VAULT`, falling back to `~/Obsidian/Conducty/`. Set the env var in your shell profile if you keep your vault elsewhere:

```bash
export CONDUCTY_VAULT="$HOME/Documents/Obsidian Vault/Conducty"
```

The installer (`install-claude-code.sh`) seeds the vault and indexes on first run. If the vault doesn't exist yet, [[conducty-obsidian]] will lazily create it and the seed indexes on first write.

## Rules

The following rules apply to all Conducty workflows. They are appended to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` by `install-claude-code.sh`.


# Conducty Quality Principles

**Appetite before plan.** Define the time budget before planning. The plan fits the appetite. A prompt that exceeds its time budget triggers a circuit breaker — stop and re-evaluate, don't spiral.

**Tracer before volley.** Run one prompt end-to-end before parallel execution. If the tracer fails, fix the plan — not just the prompt. Plan assumptions are hypotheses until a tracer validates them.

**Prompt quality is leverage.** Everything downstream compensates for bad prompts. Invest upstream: clear acceptance criteria, scoped context, concrete verification. Check for prompt smells before finalizing any plan.

**Evidence before claims.** No completion claims without fresh verification output. Use [[conducty-verify]]. Rigor scales with risk: verify-only for low, spec review for medium, full two-stage for high.

**Root cause before fixes.** When a prompt fails, ask WHERE the leverage point is: prompt quality, plan quality, or code quality. Fix at the highest level. Use [[conducty-debug]]. Three failures on the same prompt = circuit breaker — escalate.

**Design before implementation.** For non-trivial goals, use [[conducty-shape]] to define appetite, boundaries, and no-go zones before writing prompts. Skipping design wastes parallel execution slots.

**Characterize before changing.** Before modifying existing code, verify current behavior first. Every refactor starts with characterization, not transformation.

**Learn or repeat.** End every plan with [[conducty-improve]]: target vs. actual, failure patterns, experiments for the next plan. History that doesn't change behavior is just a log.



**Red flags — STOP if you catch yourself thinking:** "should work", "probably fine", "just this once", "too simple to verify", "I'll check later", "the agent said it passed". Run the verification.


# Conducty Workflow

Conducty follows a per-plan cycle: **Shape → Plan → Trace → Execute → Verify → Improve**. Each phase has a dedicated skill. You are always somewhere in this cycle. Multiple plans per day are normal — each plan note is timestamped (`Plan YYYY-MM-DD HHmm [Topic].md`).

All Conducty state — plans, designs, context, improvements, failure patterns, metrics, prompt logs — lives in an **Obsidian vault** at `$CONDUCTY_VAULT` (default `~/Obsidian/Conducty/`). Read [[conducty-obsidian]] before any state I/O.

Before starting work, list the vault for the latest `Plans/Plan *.md` note (sort by `date` then `time` frontmatter). If one is active, reference it to understand the current prompt, its scoped context, time budget, and verification step.

**Shape:** For non-trivial goals, use [[conducty-shape]] to define appetite, scope, no-go zones, and design before planning. For architectural decisions, use [[conducty-dialectic]].

**Plan:** Use [[conducty-plan]] to decompose goals into time-budgeted prompts with parallel groups, tracer markers, and calibrated review levels.

**Trace + Execute:** Use [[conducty-execute]] to run prompts. The first prompt in each group is a tracer — if it fails, re-evaluate the plan before running the rest. Review rigor scales with risk: verify-only for low, spec review for medium, full two-stage for high.

**Verify:** Use [[conducty-checkpoint]] between groups. It measures health metrics (first-attempt pass rate, retries, blocked count) and updates hill chart positions — not just pass/fail.

**Improve:** At the end of every plan, use [[conducty-review]] then [[conducty-improve]] to extract failure patterns, update `[[Metrics]]`, and shape the next plan's approach. History feeds forward — learn or repeat.

When finishing a task: (1) run the prompt's verification command via [[conducty-verify]], (2) mark the prompt complete in the plan note, (3) run [[conducty-checkpoint]] when the group is finished. Log outcomes to `[[Prompt Log]]` in the vault.
