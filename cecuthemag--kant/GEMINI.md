# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

Kant is a serverless, end-to-end encrypted P2P messenger built on libp2p + libsodium. There is no central message store: peers connect directly (or via a stateless circuit-relay v2 bootstrap node when NAT/firewalls block direct dialing). The relay only ever sees encrypted noise packets and signed registry records — never plaintext.

pnpm monorepo, workspaces defined in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` (`packages/*` + `tests/lab`).

## Commands

Install (from repo root):
```bash
npx pnpm install
```

Typecheck (root `tsc --noEmit` over the whole `packages/**` tree, per `tsconfig.json` `paths` mapping `@kant/*` → `packages/*/src`):
```bash
pnpm run typecheck   # == pnpm run lint
```

Run the app in dev (Vite dev server only — relay must be started separately, see below):
```bash
pnpm run dev
# or: ./start.sh [--relay <url>] [--port <port>]
```

Build the web app:
```bash
pnpm run build
```

### Per-package builds/dev
Most packages are plain `tsc` builds; run from repo root with `pnpm --dir packages/<name> <script>` or `cd` into the package:
- `packages/core` — `pnpm run build` / `build:test` (see tests below)
- `packages/relay` — `pnpm run build`, `pnpm run dev` (runs TS directly via `ts-node/esm`), `pnpm run start` (runs compiled `dist/`)
- `packages/app` — `pnpm run dev`, `pnpm run build` (`tsc && vite build`), `pnpm run build:electron`, `pnpm run build:android[:debug]`
- `packages/cli` — `pnpm run build`, `pnpm run start`
- `packages/push-proxy` — `pnpm run build`, `pnpm run dev`, `pnpm run start`
- `packages/desktop` — Electron packaging; `pnpm run dev` runs the app + electron concurrently; `pnpm run build:*` variants bundle a `relay-runtime` deploy of `@kant/relay` plus the built app
- `packages/admin` — placeholder, not an active product surface

### Core package tests
`packages/core` has its own Node test suite (no framework — `node --test` + a libsodium loader shim). From `packages/core`:
```bash
pnpm test              # build, build:test, then run keypair/x3dh/groups/files tests
pnpm test:coverage      # same, with node --experimental-test-coverage and coverage thresholds
```
To run a single compiled test file directly (after `pnpm run build && pnpm run build:test`):
```bash
node --loader ./sodium-loader.mjs --import ./sodium-loader.mjs --test ./dist-test/groups.test.js
```
Test sources are colocated as `*.test.ts` next to the module under test (e.g. `groups.ts` / `groups.test.ts`) and compiled via `tsconfig.test.json` into `dist-test/`.

### Root-level lab / E2E tests
`tests/lab` is a disposable Docker-based lab (protocol, relay, network, browser UI, desktop smoke tests) — **not** run locally by default, designed to run on a dedicated test node:
```bash
pnpm run test:lab            # pnpm --dir tests/lab test (Playwright)
pnpm run test:lab:ui         # Playwright UI mode
pnpm run test:lab:preflight  # bash tests/lab/scripts/preflight.sh
```
See `tests/lab/README.md` for the Docker-compose based workflow (`tests/lab/scripts/run.sh lan|nat`). The lab never uses production identity/relay data and its ports must not be exposed to the Internet.

## Architecture

### Packages
| Package | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `packages/core` (`@kant/core`) | All crypto and protocol logic: identity, X3DH handshake + double-ratchet, group messaging, file transfer, onion routing, prekeys, contacts, IndexedDB-backed message/queue storage, Tor SOCKS5 transport, licensing. This is the shared library consumed by app/cli/desktop. |
| `packages/relay` (`@kant/relay`) | Stateless libp2p circuit-relay-v2 bootstrap node. Plain Node `http` server (no framework) exposing `/relay-info`, `/healthz`, `/readyz`, `/metrics` (Prometheus via `prom-client`), `/register`, `/lookup`, `/admin/*` (bearer-token gated), `/push/*`. Deterministic relay identity derived from a seed so its multiaddr is stable across restarts. |
| `packages/app` (`@kant/app`) | React 18 + Vite web client. Also the base for the Electron desktop build (`build:electron`) and Capacitor Android build (`build:android`). |
| `packages/desktop` | Electron shell wrapping `packages/app`'s build output plus a bundled `relay-runtime` (a `pnpm deploy` of `@kant/relay`), and an MCP/AI server (`ai-server.ts`, `mcp-server.ts`). |
| `packages/cli` (`@kant/cli`) | Terminal client (`blessed`-based TUI) using `@kant/core` directly, with an IndexedDB shim (`idb-shim.ts`) since there's no browser. |
| `packages/push-proxy` | Small service holding Firebase credentials; relays wake-up push pings from relay operators without giving relays access to Firebase creds directly. |
| `packages/admin` | Placeholder — part of the paid "corporate bundle" per the licensing model, not implemented in the free/community build. |

### Networking model (core)
- `createNode()` in `packages/core/src/index.ts` builds a libp2p node (WebSockets transport, noise encryption, yamux muxing, circuit-relay-v2 transport) with a deterministic Ed25519 keypair derived from the user's identity seed, so PeerID/circuit address are stable across restarts.
- Peers register their circuit address with the relay's `/register` endpoint (signed with the identity key) and discover each other via `/lookup`. The relay is a rendezvous/relay point only — never a message store.
- Direct peer messaging uses a custom length-prefixed framing protocol over two libp2p protocols: `PING_PROTOCOL` (`/kant/ping/1.0.0`, encrypted payloads/group messages) and `RECEIPT_PROTOCOL` (`/kant/receipt/1.0.0`, delivery/read receipts). Frames are unidirectional — the sender closes the write side rather than expecting a reply.
- `transportManager.faultTolerance = NO_FATAL` is deliberate: circuit-relay reservation handshakes are intermittently flaky, and letting a single failed reservation abort startup would drop the whole node to "Offline"; the reservation store keeps retrying in the background instead.
- Group messaging, file transfer (chunked, encrypted, resumable), and onion routing (`onion.ts`, cover traffic via `COVER_TYPE`) are each separate protocols/handlers registered on the same node, all exported from `packages/core/src/index.ts`.
- All core logging goes through `clog()` / `setCoreLogger()` so the app can surface low-level transport events (dial retries, onion forwarding, inbound frames) in its in-app `DebugLog` component, not just the browser devtools console.

### App layer (`packages/app`)
- `useKant.ts` (`packages/app/src/hooks/useKant.ts`) is the central state hook — screen/navigation state, node lifecycle, contacts, per-contact message threads, unread counts — and is the main integration point between the UI and `@kant/core`. It's large; when touching messaging/contact/group flows, start there.
- `App.tsx` composes screens (`relay` setup → `setup`/`unlock` identity → `app`) and components in `src/components/` (ChatArea, GroupChatArea, ContactList, GroupList, Sidebar, RelaySettings/RelaySetupScreen, DebugLog, AiSettings).
- `src/design/` holds a separate design-system exploration (components/core/directions/shell) distinct from `src/components/`.
- Relay URL resolution: `VITE_RELAY_URL` (preferred) or legacy `VITE_RELAY_HTTP_PORT`, see `packages/app/.env.example`.

### Licensing / feature gating
`packages/core/src/license.ts` defines `COMMUNITY_FEATURES` / `PROFESSIONAL_FEATURES` / `ENTERPRISE_FEATURES` and gating helpers (`isFeatureAvailable`, `getLicenseTier`, etc.). The repo's free/community build vs. paid "corporate bundle" (admin, governance, audit tooling) split described in `README.md` and `LICENSE` is implemented through this module — the `packages/admin` package is intentionally a placeholder that only ships in the paid bundle.

## Deployment
Two deployment patterns, both centered on `packages/relay` sitting behind a TLS terminator (Caddy config at repo root: `Caddyfile`, `Dockerfile.caddy`):
- `docker-compose.https.yml` — public relay behind TLS
- `docker-compose.http.yml` — local/LAN relay over plain HTTP
- `docker-compose.push-proxy.yml` — the push-proxy service

Runtime env vars for the relay (`packages/relay/src/index.ts`): `RELAY_PORT`, `RELAY_PUBLIC_PORT`, `RELAY_INFO_PORT`, `RELAY_PUBLIC_HOST`, `RELAY_HTTP_BIND`, `RELAY_DATA_DIR`, `RELAY_SECURE`, `RELAY_LAB_CONTROL_TOKEN`. Operational runbooks live under `docs/runbooks/` (deploy, monitoring, incident response, backup/recovery, secrets rotation, release process).

## Security-sensitive context
- `docs/security/threat-model.md` and `docs/security/privacy-data-policy.md` describe the security posture; read these before changing crypto, relay trust boundaries, or data-retention behavior.
- The relay is explicitly designed to never hold plaintext or persistent message data — treat any change that would let it retain/observe message content as a regression against the core design goal, not just a feature.
