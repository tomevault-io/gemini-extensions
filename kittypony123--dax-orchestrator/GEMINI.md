## Essential Commands

### Development & Build
```bash
# Build the project (required for web server)
npm run build

# Development mode CLI
npm run cli <command>

# Run tests
npm run test

# Type checking and linting
npm run typecheck
npm run lint:check
```

### CLI Usage Patterns
```bash
# Full 7-agent pipeline analysis (recommended)
npm run cli orchestrate ./sample-data/test2

# Limit measures for faster testing
npm run cli orchestrate ./sample-data/test2 --max-measures 5

# Legacy single DAX analysis (still supported)
npm run cli analyze 'SUM(Sales[Amount])' --name 'Total Sales'

# File discovery and validation
npm run cli discover ./sample-data/test2 --preview

# Process single CSV (legacy compatibility)
npm run cli process-csv measures.csv --output documentation.md

# Generate sample test data
npm run cli create-samples
```

### Web Application
```bash
# Start both server and client (from web-app directory)
cd web-app && npm run dev

# Individual components
cd web-app && npm run server  # Express server (dynamic port, starts at :3001)
cd web-app/client && npm start  # React client on :3000

# Production mode (build + serve)
cd web-app && npm run build && npm start  # Built React app + server
```

## Architecture Overview

### 7-Agent AI Pipeline Architecture
The core innovation is a sophisticated agent orchestration system that processes Power BI data through specialized AI agents:

**Pipeline Flow:**
```
Agent 0 (CSV Parser) → Agent 1 (Domain Classifier) → [Agents 2,3,4 Parallel] → Agent 5 (Report Synthesis) → Agent 6 (Content Polish)
```

**Agent 0 (CSV Parser)**: Data ingestion and validation
- Parses INFO.VIEW exports with dynamic content detection
- Schema enrichment with format string inference and role detection
- Filters out INFO.VIEW metadata tables (Measures_Table, Column_Table, etc.)
- Builds dynamic ID mappings for relationships

**Agent 1 (Domain Classifier)**: Business context identification with confidence gating
- Identifies industry domain (transportation, finance, compliance, etc.)
- **NEW**: Falls back to "Analytics Model" with generic stakeholders when uncertain
- Determines key stakeholders and regulatory context
- Sets context for subsequent agents

**Agents 2, 3, 4 (Parallel Processing)** with concurrency limiting:
- **Agent 2**: Business glossary and terminology extraction
- **Agent 3**: Data architecture transformation to business processes  
- **Agent 4**: DAX analysis with **NEW** generic DAX linting and business explanations

**Agent 5 (Report Synthesis)**: Unified documentation generation
- Integrates heuristic measure descriptions for complete coverage
- Merges parallel agent outputs into coherent documentation

**Agent 6 (Content Polish & Review)**: Publication-ready content creation
- Comprehensive grammar, style, and readability review
- Professional tone optimization for stakeholders
- Single-page formatted output for immediate sharing
- Quality assurance and consistency validation

### Domain-Agnostic Improvements
- **DAX Linting**: Pattern-based technical analysis (division operators, AVERAGEX issues, etc.)
- **Confidence Gating**: Generic fallbacks prevent hallucination
- **Schema Enrichment**: Smart format detection and role inference
- **No-Fabrication Guardrails**: All agents instructed not to invent domain-specific content
- **Enhanced Logging**: Real-time Claude API call timing and progress visibility

### Key Components

**AgentOrchestrator** (`src/agent-orchestrator.ts`)
- Coordinates the 7-agent pipeline with concurrency limiting (p-limit)
- Manages shared Claude client for API efficiency
- Handles parallel processing of Agents 2, 3, 4
- **NEW**: Artifact versioning with metadata (schema v1.0.0)
- Provides progress callbacks for web UI

**InfoViewParser** (`src/csv-parser.ts`)
- Robust CSV parsing with filename-agnostic detection
- **NEW**: Schema enrichment with format string inference
- Dynamic table/column ID mapping for relationships
- INFO.VIEW metadata filtering to exclude utility tables
- Handles Power BI relationship string parsing

**ClaudeClient** (`src/claude-config.ts`)
- Anthropic API integration with error handling
- **NEW**: Enhanced logging with request timing
- Retry logic and timeout management
- Shared across all agents for efficiency

**Domain-Agnostic Libraries** (`src/lib/`)
- `dax-lint.ts`: Generic DAX pattern analysis (technical, not domain-specific)
- `format-defaults.ts`: Smart schema enrichment and format inference
- `measure-heuristics.ts`: Model-agnostic measure classification
- `measure-enricher.ts`: Business context merging without domain assumptions

### Web Application Architecture

**Server** (`web-app/server.js`)
- Express server with file upload handling
- WebSocket support for real-time progress updates
- Agent orchestration integration
- Temporary file management

**Client** (`web-app/client/src/`)
- React application with file drop interface
- Smart file detection (content-based, not filename-dependent)
- Real-time progress tracking via WebSocket
- Results viewer with formatted documentation

## Critical Implementation Details

### CSV File Processing
The parser must handle any Power BI INFO.VIEW export format:
- Files can have any names (input1.csv, data.csv, etc.)
- Content-based detection determines file types
- Dynamic ID mapping resolves relationships between tables/columns
- INFO.VIEW metadata tables are automatically filtered

### Agent Context Passing
```typescript
interface AgentContext {
  measures?: any[];
  tables?: any[];
  columns?: any[];
  relationships?: any[];
  domain?: string;          // Set by Agent 1
  stakeholders?: string[];  // Set by Agent 1
  businessContext?: string; // User-provided context
}
```

### Data Quality Assurance
The system automatically filters INFO.VIEW metadata including:
- `Measures_Table`, `Column_Table`, `Relationship_table`, `Tables_table`
- Tables with `_TABLE` suffix
- Any table containing INFO.VIEW expressions

## Environment Requirements

### Required Environment Variables
```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_claude_api_key  # Required for AI analysis
```

### API Configuration
- Model: `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` (latest Sonnet 4)
- Default timeout: 60 seconds
- Max tokens: 2000-2500 depending on agent

## Testing Strategy

### Test Data Structure
```
sample-data/
├── test2/    # Sales Analytics domain (working dataset) - 7 measures, 6 tables
├── test3/    # Transportation domain - bike share analytics
├── test9/    # Empty dataset - tests domain fallback to "Analytics Model"
└── *.csv     # Legacy root-level exports (measures.csv, tables.csv, etc.)
```

### Test Commands
```bash
# Unit tests
npm run test

# Agent orchestration testing
npm run test:agents

# Legacy CLI testing
npm run test:legacy
```

## Web Deployment Considerations

### Build Dependencies
The web server depends on compiled TypeScript:
1. Run `npm run build` in main directory
2. Web server imports from `../dist/agent-orchestrator`
3. Any source changes require rebuild for web app

### File Upload Handling
- Supports drag-and-drop of any 4 CSV files
- Automatic content-type detection
- Temporary file cleanup after processing
- WebSocket progress updates during analysis

## Common Troubleshooting

### CSV Parser Issues
- Ensure all 4 file types present (measures, tables, columns, relationships)
- Check for INFO.VIEW metadata contamination
- Verify column headers match Power BI export format

### Agent Pipeline Failures
- Confirm ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is set
- Check API rate limits and timeout settings
- Review agent confidence scores for quality assessment

### Web Application Issues
- Ensure main project is built (`npm run build`)
- Check WebSocket connection on port 3003
- Verify file upload size limits (10MB default)

## Domain Intelligence

The system is **designed to be domain-agnostic** and has proven performance across:
- **Sales Analytics**: E-commerce revenue and customer insights (test2 dataset)  
- **Transportation**: Bike share operations (4.8M trips)
- **Compliance**: UK social housing fire safety regulations
- **Finance**: Any DAX-based financial reporting
- **Generic Analytics**: Falls back gracefully for unknown domains

**Domain-Agnostic Design Principles:**
- Agent 1 classifies domains but falls back to generic "Analytics Model" when uncertain
- All agents avoid inventing domain-specific terminology or business processes
- Heuristic analysis works with any DAX formula regardless of business context
- Technical linting focuses on DAX patterns, not business rules
- Confidence gating prevents hallucination across all domains

## File Organization Patterns

### Source Structure  
- `src/agents/`: Specialized AI agent implementations (0-6)
- `src/lib/`: Domain-agnostic utility libraries
- `src/helpers/`: Shared utilities (retry logic, etc.)
- `src/types.ts`: Core data type definitions
- `src/csv-parser.ts`: Power BI data ingestion
- `src/claude-config.ts`: API client management
- `src/agent-orchestrator.ts`: Pipeline coordination
- `docs/`: Organized documentation and test outputs
- `sample-data/`: Clean test datasets with output directories

### Output Patterns & Artifacts
The system generates comprehensive artifacts in `{dataset}/out/`:
- `final_report.json`: Complete analysis results with lint findings
- `meta.json`: Schema v1.0.0 metadata with generation timestamp
- `model_documentation.html`: Formatted HTML for immediate sharing
- `model_documentation.md`: Markdown for technical teams
- `model_kpis.csv`: Structured data export
- `synthesis.json`: Pre-polish intermediate analysis

**Each output includes:**
- Business-friendly language optimized for stakeholders
- Executive summaries with key insights and confidence scores
- Technical DAX analysis with generic pattern-based linting
- Domain-appropriate stakeholder identification (or generic fallback)
- Immediate sharing capability without additional editing
