- Python.
- FastAPI.
- Starlette.
- Pydantic.
- SQLAlchemy.

### Database

- PostgreSQL.
- Supabase.
- Alembic migrations.

### Frontend

- Jinja templates.
- TailwindCSS.
- Vanilla JavaScript.
- Static assets in `src/frontend/static`.

### Jobs & Integrations

- APScheduler.
- Gmail APIs.
- Google APIs.
- OTA workflows.
- Redis/cache support.

### Testing

- pytest.
- Tests under `tests/`.

## Architecture Rules

### Backend

Keep:

- API/session/request handling in `src/backend/api/` and `src/backend/main.py`.
- Business workflows in `src/backend/services/`.
- Database models/utilities in `src/backend/db/`.
- Migrations in `alembic/`.
- Schemas in `src/backend/schemas/`.

Domain grouping (từ 2026-07):

- `src/backend/api/` gom theo domain: `hr/`, `operations/`, `ota/`, `system/`, `pms/`, `inventory/` — file route mới đặt vào đúng package domain.
- `src/backend/db/models/` là package tách theo domain; import model qua `from src.backend.db.models import X` (re-export từ `__init__.py`).
- `src/backend/services/identity/` (parser giấy tờ), `src/backend/services/vn_address/` (địa chỉ VN) — logic parse KHÔNG đặt trong `src/backend/api/`.
- Một instance Jinja2Templates duy nhất: `src/backend/core/templates.py`. Không tự tạo instance mới trong route module.
- Đường dẫn data/log lấy từ `src.backend.core.config` (`STATIC_DATA_DIR`, `LOG_DIR`, `APP_DIR`, `FRONTEND_DIR`), không tính từ `__file__`.
- Route snapshot test (`tests/test_app_smoke.py`) phải pass sau mọi thay đổi route; đổi route có chủ đích thì regenerate baseline (xem `.claude/commands/test.md`).

### Frontend

Keep:

- Presentation logic in `src/frontend/templates/` and `src/frontend/static/`.
- Không viết `<style>`/`<script>` logic trong template; CSS ra `static/css/{domain}/`, JS ra `static/js/{domain}/`. Biến từ server truyền qua `window.PAGE_DATA`.
- Keyframes dùng chung khai báo ở `static/css/shared/components.css` với prefix `bb-`; không đặt trùng tên keyframes của Tailwind (`fadeIn`, `pulse`, `ping`, `fade-in-up`).
- Chi tiết đầy đủ: `docs/frontend-conventions.md`.

Preserve:

- Desktop layout integrity.
- Mobile responsiveness.
- Touch-friendly interactions.
- Consistent spacing and hierarchy.
- Existing interaction patterns.

Avoid:

- Unnecessary animations.
- Layout instability.
- Client-side business rules when server state should decide.

## Critical Invariants

These areas are high-risk and require extra caution:

- Reservation state transitions.
- Inventory state transitions.
- Check-in/check-out flows.
- Branch/user visibility rules.
- Auth/session boundaries.
- OTA parsing and matching logic.
- Pricing calculations.
- Cross-module utilities.
- Execution-critical functions.

Do not modify these blindly. Always inspect before changing behavior:

- Execution flows.
- Affected callers.
- Downstream dependencies.
- Related services.
- Permissions/session scope.

Never expose secrets in code. Keep secrets in environment variables. Never bypass permission checks for convenience.

# Engineering Rules

## Decision Rules

Before implementing:

- State assumptions explicitly when uncertainty exists.
- If multiple interpretations exist, ask or present options.
- Prefer the simplest working solution.
- Push against unnecessary complexity.
- Do not silently introduce architectural changes.
- If scope is unclear, stop and clarify first.

## Simplicity Rules

- Prefer the smallest working solution.
- Avoid speculative abstractions.
- Avoid abstractions for single-use logic.
- Reuse existing patterns before introducing new architecture.
- Avoid unnecessary dependencies.
- Avoid premature optimization.
- Prefer readability over cleverness.
- If a solution feels overly generic, simplify it.
- Do not create reusable abstractions until duplication or repetition is proven.

## Surgical Change Rules

- Touch only files directly related to the task.
- Do not refactor unrelated code.
- Do not rewrite stable working code unnecessarily.
- Preserve existing naming and structure.
- Match existing project style and patterns.
- Remove only artifacts introduced by your own changes.
- Keep change directly tied to the requested task.

If unrelated issues are discovered:

- Mention them separately.
- Do not silently fix them.

## Scope Discipline

Do not expand scope without explicit approval.

If additional improvements are discovered:

- Mention them separately.
- Do not implement automatically.

Avoid:

- Opportunistic rewrites.
- Cleanup-only edits.
- Unrelated refactors during feature work.

## Stability Rules

- Prefer stable working code over idealized refactors.
- Minimize regression risk over code elegance.
- Avoid broad rewrites unless explicitly requested.
- Preserve existing execution flow stability.
- Prefer consistency over architectural perfection.

## Architecture Safety

- Do not silently introduce new architecture patterns.
- Do not move logic between layers unless requested.
- Preserve existing service boundaries.
- Preserve existing request/session ownership.
- Respect existing module responsibilities.

## Verification Workflow

### Bug Fixes

Verify:

- Reproduction before fix when possible.
- Fix behavior.
- Regression risk.

### Refactors

Verify:

- Before behavior.
- After behavior.
- Unchanged external behavior.

### UI Changes

Verify:

- Desktop layout integrity.
- Mobile responsiveness.
- Touch interactions.
- Modal behavior.
- No broken states.
- No layout shifts.

### API / Backend Changes

Verify:

- Response compatibility.
- Affected consumers.
- Permissions/session scope.
- Filters/query behavior.
- Data consistency.

### Before Commit

Always:

- Inspect git diff/status.
- Run relevant tests.
- Verify changed flows.
- Run `gitnexus_detect_changes()` — BỎ QUA nếu index chưa trỏ đúng repo (xem cảnh báo mục GitNexus); khi bỏ qua phải ghi rõ trong commit.

Never claim behavior was tested if it was not. Clearly distinguish:

- Verified behavior.
- Assumptions.
- Unverified expectations.

## Task Completion Workflow

Before considering a task complete:

1. Verify implementation.
2. Verify no regressions.
3. Inspect git diff for unrelated changes.
4. Verify affected execution flows.
5. Update documentation if behavior changed.
6. Summarize affected modules and risks.

## Documentation Sync

When changes affect:

- Architecture.
- Execution flows.
- Business rules.
- API contracts.
- Database structure.
- UI interaction patterns.
- Operational workflows.

Update corresponding `.claude/` or `docs/` files.

Documentation updates should:

- Describe final behavior only.
- Avoid implementation history.
- Preserve existing formatting.
- Remain concise and navigable.
- Update only affected sections.

Avoid:

- Changelog-style updates.
- Rewriting entire documents unnecessarily.

## Response Behavior

- Be concise and direct.
- Surface uncertainty early.
- Explain tradeoffs clearly.
- Prefer concrete reasoning over generic advice.
- Do not pretend certainty when uncertain.
- Avoid unnecessary verbosity.

## Anti-Patterns

Never:

- Rewrite large files unnecessarily.
- Introduce frameworks without request.
- Silently change architecture.
- Mix feature work with unrelated refactors.
- Mass rename with raw find/replace.
- Create speculative abstractions.
- Add layers for hypothetical future use.
- Bypass verification workflows.
- Modify unrelated formatting/styles.

# GitNexus — Code Intelligence

> **CẢNH BÁO (2026-07-27): index hiện tại KHÔNG trỏ vào repo này.**
> Gọi `detect_changes(repo="wbbinbin")` trả về symbol của một repo Next.js
> khác (`src/frontend/src/app/[locale]/cart/page.tsx`, `HotelDetailClient`,
> `Navbar`…) — không file nào tồn tại ở PMSBinBin. Tên `binbinops` cũng
> không có trong danh sách repo đã index.
>
> Cho tới khi chạy `npx gitnexus analyze` tại thư mục gốc PMSBinBin để tạo
> index đúng: **không dùng kết quả GitNexus để đánh giá phạm vi thay đổi.**
> Thay bằng grep/đọc code trực tiếp + pytest + verify trình duyệt, và ghi
> rõ trong commit khi bỏ qua bước này.

Sau khi đã index đúng, dùng GitNexus MCP tools để:

- Understand architecture.
- Inspect execution flows.
- Analyze blast radius.
- Trace runtime behavior.
- Safely refactor symbols.

If any GitNexus tool reports a stale index, run:

```bash
npx gitnexus analyze
```

## GitNexus Workflow

Use GitNexus before modifying:

- Shared business logic.
- Auth/session flows.
- Reservation/inventory state transitions.
- OTA parsing/matching logic.
- Pricing calculations.
- Cross-module utilities.
- Execution-critical functions.

## Explore Unfamiliar Systems

Use:

```js
gitnexus_query({query: "concept"})
```

To:

- Discover related execution flows.
- Inspect connected processes.
- Avoid broad grepping.

## Understand Symbol Relationships

Use:

```js
gitnexus_context({name: "symbolName"})
```

To inspect:

- Callers.
- Callees.
- Dependencies.
- Execution flows.

## Analyze Blast Radius

Before modifications use:

```js
gitnexus_impact({
  target: "symbolName",
  direction: "upstream"
})
```

Review:

- Callers.
- Affected processes.
- Downstream impact.
- Risk level.

If risk level is `HIGH` or `CRITICAL`, explain risks before continuing.

## Safe Refactoring

Never mass rename symbols using raw find/replace.

Use:

```js
gitnexus_rename()
```

for symbol renames.

## Before Commit

Always run:

```js
gitnexus_detect_changes()
```

Verify:

- Affected symbols.
- Execution flows.
- Expected blast radius.
- Unrelated modifications.

## Recent Operational Fixes

### 1. WMS Active Ticket Date Filter Bypass (May 2026)
- **Problem**: Active pending or shipping tickets (`PENDING`, `SHIPPING`) from previous months were hidden by default because the front-end WMS page lists filter by the current month range. However, they were still counted by global sidebar notification badges, causing a permanent badge count vs list view mismatch and preventing users from ever resolving (receiving/completing) old tickets.
- **Fix**: Skip date range queries on `requests.py` list APIs (`get_request_tickets` & `get_request_tickets_list`), `page_load.py` count APIs (`get_page_load` & `get_reception_page_load`), and `overview.py` SQL stats query when explicitly checking unresolved active statuses (`PENDING`, `SHIPPING`). Active tickets now correctly remain visible in the dashboard and lists regardless of creation date, aligning counts perfectly.

### 2. Relocated & Synced Pending Approvals Badge (May 2026)
- **Problem**: The pending approvals count badge was nested inside the inner tab "Chờ duyệt" (Pending) segment button, making it hard to notice from other main WMS tabs.
- **Fix**: 
  - Removed old segment badges from all variations of `tab_approvals.html` templates.
  - Placed a pulsing, animated count badge directly on the main header navigation tab **"Duyệt yêu cầu"** (Approve requests) inside both `manager/index.html` and `reception_request.html`.
  - Synced the count between independent Alpine.js scopes (header vs main body content) by dispatching a custom window event `inventory:set-pending-count` inside the app's `initApp()` method and `$watch` handlers in `static/js/inventory/manager/index.js` and `modules/reception_request/index.js`.
