# Pix3 Editor - AI Agent Guidelines

Authoritative instructions for Pix3 development. These guidelines ensure consistent code generation and adherence to project architecture patterns.

## Project Overview

- **Pix3** is a browser-based editor for HTML5 scenes blending 2D and 3D layers.
- **Stack**: TypeScript + Vite, Lit web components, Valtio state, Three.js, Golden Layout.
- **Architecture**: Operations-first with `OperationService` as mutation gateway.
- **Source of Truth**: `docs/pix3-specification.md` (version is the number in its own title — don't cite one here).
- **Capabilities catalog**: `docs/nodes-and-systems.md` — the inventory of every node, `core:*` behavior, system, and scripts-facing runtime API (and how to use each). **Check it before writing custom game logic**; it also carries the engine-vs-game decision. For agents building on the engine, the `pix3-game-dev` skill is the entry point.

## Essential Architecture Patterns

### Component System (Lit)

- **Base Class**: Extend `ComponentBase` from `@/fw` (not raw `LitElement`).
- **DOM Mode**: Default to **Light DOM** for global style integration.
- **Shadow DOM**: Use only when explicitly needed: `static useShadowDom = true`.
- **Styling**:
  - Separate CSS files: `[component].ts.css`.
  - Light DOM: `import './component.ts.css';`
  - Shadow DOM: `import styles from './component.ts.css?raw';` + `static styles = css`${unsafeCSS(styles)}`;`
- **Accent Color**: Use CSS variables `--pix3-accent-color` (#ffcf33) and `--pix3-accent-rgb`.
- **Icons**: Use **vector icons via `IconService`** (`@inject(IconService)` → `getIcon(name, IconSize.*)`), never emoji or Unicode symbol glyphs (📎🔑✕✓📄↻●⏸). Register a custom SVG in `IconService` if the icon isn't in Feather. Emoji belong only in user-authored content, never in UI chrome.

### Dependency Injection

- **Decorators**: Use `@injectable()` for services and `@inject(ServiceClass)` for injection.
- **Container**: Register services in `ServiceContainer` (singleton by default).
- **Lifecycle**: Services must implement `dispose()` if they hold resources or subscriptions.
- **Lazy injection**: `@injectLazy(() => import('…').then(m => m.ServiceClass))` makes the property a `LazyService<T>` async accessor — the module is `import()`-ed once (cached), and the service is resolved through the container on every `await this.foo()` call, so re-registration is observed and singleton/transient lifetimes behave exactly like `@inject`. Keeps heavy modules out of the eager bundle. Use **sparingly** for heavy, rarely-used services whose consumers only touch them inside async flows (e.g. Monaco IntelliSense, playable export); `@inject` remains the default.
- **Collab CRDT stack is lazy**: the ~140 KB `yjs`/`@hocuspocus/provider` stack loads only when `CollaborationService.connect()` runs (`connect()` is `async` and `import()`s it on first collab connect), so solo/local sessions never pull it — new code must NOT add eager top-level `yjs`/`@hocuspocus` value imports anywhere except `src/services/collab/SceneCRDTBinding.ts` (itself reached only via dynamic `import()`); use `import type` for CRDT types elsewhere.

### State Management (Valtio)

- **Global State**: `appState` proxy in `src/state/AppState.ts`. **Never mutate directly**.
- **Gateway scope**: The Command→Operation gateway governs **document state** — the scene graph, node properties, and project files, i.e. anything undoable/saveable. **Session/UI/infrastructure state** in `appState` (auth, collab connection/presence, router, project open/close lifecycle, script-load status, error surfacing, tab management, refresh signals) is owned by its dedicated service and may be written by that service directly, outside the gateway. (Audit 2026-07-22: every current direct `appState` writer falls in this second category.)
- **Nodes & State**: Nodes live in `SceneGraph` (managed by `SceneManager`), **not in reactive state**.
- **Sync**: State tracks node IDs for selection and hierarchy. UI subscribes via `subscribe(appState.section, callback)`.
- **Cleanup**: Always dispose subscriptions in `disconnectedCallback` or `dispose`.

### Scripting & Component System

- **Unified Components**: All scripts are `Script` instances in `node.components` (Unity-style).
- **Base Class**: Extend `Script` from `@pix3/runtime` (provides `onAttach`, `onStart`, `onUpdate`, `onDetach`).
- **Registration**: Register new script types in `ScriptRegistry`.
- **Mutations**: Use `AddComponentCommand` / `RemoveComponentCommand` for management.

### Commands and Operations

- **Operations**: Encapsulate mutation logic. Implement `perform()` returning `undo`/`redo` closures.
- **Commands**: Thin wrappers around operations. Validate state in `preconditions()`.
- **Dispatcher**: All actions **MUST** flow through `CommandDispatcher.execute(CommandClass, args)`.
- **Menu System**: Commands opt-in via metadata: `menuPath`, `shortcut`, `addToMenu`. Register in `CommandRegistry`.

### Property Schema System

- **Metadata**: Node/Script classes implement `static getPropertySchema()`.
- **Dynamic UI**: Inspector consumes schemas to render property editors (Vector2, Color, Enum, etc.).
- **Updates**: All property changes use `UpdateObjectPropertyOperation`.

## File Structure Conventions

### Core & Runtime

- `packages/pix3-runtime/src/`: Core engine logic (Nodes, SceneManager, Script base).
- `src/core/`: Editor-specific logic (HistoryManager, LayoutManager, Keybindings).
- `src/fw/`: Framework utilities (DI, ComponentBase, Property Schema).

### Features (Commands & Operations)

- `src/features/scene/`: Node creation, deletion, reparenting, prefabs.
- `src/features/scripts/`: Script management, play mode control.
- `src/features/properties/`: Object property updates.
- `src/features/selection/`: Selection logic.

### UI & Services

- `src/ui/`: Lit components organized by panel (viewport, inspector, assets, etc.).
- `src/services/`: Injectable services, grouped into domain subdirectories: `core`, `scene`, `project`, `cloud`, `collab`, `assets`, `scripting`, `play`, `export`, `editor`, `animation`, `localization`, `image-gen`, `bg-removal`, `library`, `viewport`, `agent`, `llm`, `ao-bake`, `atlas`. A new service goes into the fitting domain folder; there are no loose files at the `src/services/` root.
- `src/state/`: Valtio state definitions.

**Imports**: `src/services` has no barrel — always deep-import a service directly from its domain folder (`@/services/<domain>/FooService`). `src/state/index.ts` is a real module (it owns the `appState` singleton), so import state from `@/state`. `packages/pix3-runtime/src/index.ts` is a published package boundary and stays.

## Critical Rules for AI Agents

1. **Mutation Gate**: Never mutate `appState` or `Node` properties directly. Use `CommandDispatcher`.
2. **Aliases**: Always use `@/` (for `src`) and `@pix3/runtime` (for packages) aliases.
3. **Types**: Never use `any`. Use explicit types or `unknown` with type guards.
4. **Selection**: When creating nodes, update both `selection.nodeIds` and `selection.primaryNodeId`.
5. **Portals**: Use `DropdownPortal` for floating UI (dropdowns, tooltips) to avoid clipping.
   5a. **Icons**: All UI icons render through `IconService.getIcon(...)` (vector SVG). Never hardcode emoji/glyphs as icons.
6. **Async Safety**: Use `CommandDispatcher` to handle command execution flow and errors.
7. **Proactiveness**: If a command requires a service, check its availability and register if necessary.
8. **Documentation**: Keep the canonical doc set current; do **not** add new `.md` files. The set is `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and under `docs/`: `pix3-specification.md`, `nodes-and-systems.md`, `node-types-reference.md`, `property-schema-reference.md`, `architecture.md`. New material = a section in one of these + a row in CLAUDE.md's doc router (not a new file).
9. **Plans**: Planning documents are the one exception to rule 8, and they all live in `.plans/` — active plans plus the operational `TODO.md` in the folder root, finished ones moved to `.plans/done/` via `git mv`. Never create a plan/TODO file at the repository root.
10. **A green test suite is not verification.** Tests catch what someone thought to assert; they do not catch paint order, a dead affordance, or a gate nobody wrote. Anything user-facing gets checked in the running editor (chrome-devtools MCP), judged by state — `window.__PIX3_DEBUG__`, node/document properties, DOM measurements — with a screenshot only for genuinely visual questions. Clean up afterwards and confirm `git status samples/` is empty.
11. **Verify against an independent measurement, not the tool's own output.** A restamped anchor satisfying the equation the restamp was derived from proves nothing; decode the source file and compute the answer another way. Real examples from this repo: the trim tool's anchor was confirmed by computing the PNG's alpha bounding box separately, the chroma key by predicting the affected pixel count from the source pixels, a bulk flip by comparing the output against a mirrored read of its input, and the video importer against a clip authored so a failed seek would show up as repeated pixels.
12. **Suspect the harness before declaring a bug.** Measurement mistakes outnumber real regressions here: a wrong property name, `display: contents` reporting 0×0, a reading taken after playback ended, or dispatching only `change` at a control that reads its value in `@input`. Re-check how you measured, then report.
13. **An implementation contract is derived, not authoritative.** A `.plans/` contract section can be incomplete or can have drifted from the product spec it was written against. Before implementing, read the source-of-truth section it derives from (a decision table, a drag matrix) and say so when the two disagree — implementing the contract literally and silently is how a row of a matrix ends up as a dead affordance.
