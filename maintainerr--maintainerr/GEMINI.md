# Translations (Lingui + Weblate)

Read this before adding or changing any user-facing text in `apps/ui`.
Catalogs live in `apps/ui/src/locales/*.po` and are translated on
[Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/maintainerr/).

## A translation must never change behavior

Translate text the user reads, and nothing else. A string that is displayed
*and* used for something else stops being display text: switching language then
changes what the app does, and no test written in English can see it.

Before wrapping a string, follow where the value goes. It must not reach:

- **Anything persisted or sent to a server.** A default collection name built
  from a translated word is stored on Plex in whatever language the form was
  submitted in.
- **Anything parsed or compared.** `startsWith`, `includes`, `===`, a `switch`,
  `.toLowerCase()` - a prefix agreed between two functions must be a constant
  they share, never a message.
- **Any key or identifier.** Grouping keys, `Map`/`Set` members, TanStack Query
  keys, React keys, DOM `id`/`name`. Key on the enum or id the label was
  derived from, and translate only at the point of display.
- **Any hook dependency array that guards work.** See below.

Sorting a list by its displayed labels is fine - that is display order, and it
is *meant* to follow the language.

## Where a translation resolves

`useLingui()`'s `t` is a render-scoped value: it changes when the locale
changes, which is exactly why a component re-renders in the new language. That
also makes it a dependency.

- **In render** - use the hook's `t`. The component re-renders on a language
  switch and the text follows.
- **In an effect, an async callback, or an event handler** - use `t` from
  `@lingui/core/macro`, aliased as `globalT` when the file also uses the hook.
  It resolves against the active locale when it runs, and it is not reactive,
  so it stays out of the dependency array.

When aliasing an existing file to `globalT`, rename the call sites by hand.
A blind replace of ``t` `` also rewrites the `t` that ends a message
(``t`Delete Soonest` `` becomes ``globalT`Delete SoonesglobalT` ``), which still
compiles and still renders text. Diff the message strings against the previous
revision afterwards.

Putting the hook's `t` in an effect's dependencies makes that effect re-run on
every language switch: re-fetching data, re-firing toasts, and in one case
reloading a form and discarding the user's unsaved edits.

A component that renders translated text must consume the i18n context, or a
language switch will not reach it. `I18nProvider` re-renders context consumers
only - React reuses the untouched children subtree - so a component that calls
core-macro `t` in its render path and never calls `useLingui()` keeps the
language it first mounted with. Navigation hides this by remounting the page;
anything mounted during the switch shows it.

## Which macro

| Where | Import | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Inside a React component | `@lingui/react/macro` | `<Trans>` for JSX text, `` t` ` `` from `useLingui()` for attributes, toasts, handlers, `<Plural>` for counts |
| Plain module (`utils/`, `api/`, helpers) | `@lingui/core/macro` | `` t` ` `` / `plural()` - resolves when the function runs |
| A value held before render | `@lingui/core/macro` | `msg` descriptor, translated at the call site with `t(descriptor)` |

Never call the runtime `i18n._()` directly - `useLingui()`'s `t` resolves a
descriptor just as well and keeps the underscore API out of the codebase.

## Module scope freezes a translation

A `const` holding `` t` ` `` is evaluated once, at import, in whichever locale
loaded first. Anything defined outside a render must be either a `msg`
descriptor or a builder function called during render:

```ts
// wrong - frozen at import
const OPTIONS = [{ value: 'movie', label: t`Movies` }]

// right - resolved per render
const buildOptions = () => [{ value: 'movie', label: t`Movies` }]
```

The same applies to **default parameter values**, which run before
`useLingui()`. Resolve them in the body instead: `const label = props.label ?? t\`Save\``.

## Placeholders

- Give every placeholder a name. Hoist member expressions into a local, or use
  the labelled form: `` t`Failed to reach ${{ serverName }}` ``. An unnamed
  `{0}` tells a translator nothing. Keep the **whole** expression when you
  hoist - `props.collection.title`, never `props.collection`.
- **A single quote is an ICU escape character.** `'{name}'` renders the literal
  text `{name}` and eats the quotes, silently dropping the value. Write a
  literal apostrophe beside a placeholder as `''` (`&apos;&apos;` in JSX). A
  lone apostrophe not touching a brace ("don't") is fine.
- `<Plural one="... {name}">` does **not** bind `name`. Use `plural()` from the
  core macro with the placeholder inside each choice instead.

## Counted text

Never build a plural by appending `s`. `${n} item${n === 1 ? '' : 's'}` is
wrong in most languages - use `plural()` or `<Plural>` so translators can
supply their own forms.

## Whole sentences, not fragments

A sentence split across several messages cannot be reordered by a translator.
Keep inline markup and values inside one `<Trans>`. Where the original built a
sentence from a ternary (`Unmonitor this ${type}`), spell out one complete
message per branch rather than interpolating a bare noun.

## Translations never change behavior

A translation may change display text and nothing else. Hard rules, in
priority order:

- Nothing translated may feed logic: no comparisons (`===`, `startsWith`),
  no object/map/query/React keys, no DOM ids or `name` attributes, no sort
  values, no storage, no API payloads, and never data persisted anywhere.
- Wrapping a string is outcome-identical. The English output stays
  byte-for-byte what it was, and the surrounding code keeps its shape: do
  not add or remove memoization, change dependency arrays, or reword copy
  to make a message "translate better". The code is the fixed point;
  translations adapt to it.
- Tokens a translator must not be able to alter live outside the message.
  Units are assembled in code (`` label={`${t`Max Size`} (MB)`} ``); cron
  expressions, file extensions, example values and domain names arrive as
  named placeholders fed from the same constant the logic uses, so message
  and behavior cannot disagree.
- One source of truth for label maps. Lingui only extracts literal
  descriptors, so a `msg` map in the UI replaces a shared string map -
  delete the old constant rather than mirroring it.
- Dates and times come from `Intl` with `i18n.locale`, not from catalog
  messages. Local formats are wanted; hand-rolled month or weekday
  messages are not.

## Security: translator input is untrusted

Weblate translators are third parties, and a `msgstr` ships to every
user's browser after an automated merge pipeline.

- URLs and domains are never translatable. `href`s live in code only;
  visible link text and domain mentions ride through as named placeholders
  (`{tmdbDomain}`), so no translation can display a target the link does
  not open.
- A checker is only worth what it reads. Lingui's PO parser is more forgiving
  than ours, and two shapes once slipped a translation past every content
  check while Lingui still bound it to a live message: an obsolete `#~` block
  (skipped here as a comment, restored by Lingui onto the live id) and a
  `msgstr` written above its `msgid`. The validator now rejects both outright
  rather than trying to mirror Lingui's leniency - the catalogs are
  machine-written, so any deviation from canonical form is either corruption
  or hand-shaping. Keep it that way, and when adding a content check ask first
  whether the entry it inspects is the one the app will render.
- The integrity check is keyed on the pull request's **author**, never its
  branch name: a contributor picks their own branch name, so matching
  `weblate-*` would let anyone switch off the check that judges their
  translations.
- `yarn i18n:validate` is the deterministic gate and a required check on
  every PR. Beyond placeholder parity it rejects the Trojan Source bidi
  set (overrides, embeddings and isolates), invisible characters (zero
  width space, word joiner, soft hyphen, Braille blank, BOM, interlinear
  annotation, the Tags block), Zalgo combining runs, entries over 1000
  characters, any message that does not compile as ICU MessageFormat, any
  translation that keeps an argument's name but changes its structure (a
  plural rewritten as a plain value, a plural category the locale needs
  dropped, a number format stripped, a select branch dropped or added),
  any translation that introduces a URL marker (`://`, the
  fullwidth-colon homoglyph, `www.`, `mailto:`, `tel:`) absent from its
  source, and any source message containing a URL marker at all. Do not
  weaken it: it is the line that holds even if Weblate-side checks are
  reconfigured or a commit lands between review approval and the
  automated merge.

## Do NOT translate

Every message costs translator budget, and some translations actively cause
harm by disagreeing with the value beside them.

- URLs and domains, in any form - see the security section above.

- Product names on their own: Plex, Jellyfin, Emby, Radarr, Sonarr, Sportarr,
  Seerr, Tautulli, Streamystats, Tracearr, Maintainerr, TMDB, TVDB,
  qBittorrent. A *phrase* containing one is translated (`Plex Settings`).
- Universal acronyms and notation: `URL`, `TLS`, `API`, geometry labels
  (`X`, `Y`, `W`, `H`).
- Units and the sizes built from them: `MB`, `GB`, `ms`, `N/A`, `< 1 MB`. A
  translated unit can contradict the number printed next to it.
- CSS classes, design tokens, colours, cron expressions, file paths, example
  values and placeholders (`http://localhost:8080`).
- Image `alt` text - it is not worth the catalog budget.
- Strings that never reach the screen: `console.*`, thrown `Error` messages
  that are caught internally, `errorContext` telemetry, and **the summary
  passed to `logClientError`**, which is a server log line.
- Overlay template seed content (`New Text`, `in {0} days`) - that is stored
  data a user edits, not UI chrome.

## Tests

- Specs must import `render`/`renderHook` from `src/test-utils/render`, which
  supplies the i18n context. `src/test-utils/i18n.tsx` is also listed in
  `setupFiles`, so plain modules translate in specs too. An empty catalog makes
  Lingui fall back to the message id, i.e. the English source - existing
  assertions keep working.
- `src/locales/catalog-icu.spec.tsx` renders both the source text and every
  non-empty translation in all 13 catalogs through the real `<Trans>` runtime
  with a sentinel per argument. If a value stops reaching the screen, it fails.
  Translations are checked because the realistic ICU-quoting bug arrives from
  Weblate, and placeholder-parity validation cannot see it - a quoted
  `'{name}'` is still textually present. Keep both halves.
- `src/locales/core-macro.spec.ts` proves a plain-module string resolves
  through the catalog. Without it nothing would catch a `t` that stopped
  being compiled, because an untransformed macro returns the source string
  and every other assertion still passes.
- **A catalog is keyed by a generated message id, not by the source text.**
  Loading `{ 'Delete Soonest': '...' }` in a spec silently matches nothing.
  Derive the key instead - `` const m = msg`Delete Soonest` `` gives the same
  id the macro emits, so load `{ [m.id]: '...' }`. Placeholders are part of
  the id, so the labelled names must match the source exactly.

## Before you push

```bash
yarn workspace @maintainerr/ui i18n:extract   # catalogs follow the source
yarn i18n:validate                            # placeholder parity across locales
yarn workspace @maintainerr/ui i18n:check     # catalog is current
yarn i18n:verify                              # against a running app (see below)
```

`i18n:verify` writes a sentinel into `sv.po`, drives the running app in Swedish,
checks the sentinel reaches the screen for each macro form, and restores the
catalog - including on failure. It needs Playwright, which is deliberately not
a repo dependency because it downloads browser binaries; the script prints the
install command. `--dry-run` exercises the catalog round trip without a
browser.

Never hand-edit a `msgstr` in a catalog to "fix" something - that is Weblate's
job, and the next sync will overwrite it. CI enforces this: `yarn i18n:validate`
by default fails if a translated `msgstr` was altered or added versus the base
branch, so a code PR can only add empty entries for new source strings, never
touch a translation. Weblate syncs opt out with `--no-base`.

## Reviewing an i18n change

Do not review only the happy path. Wrapping a string can change what the user
sees even when the diff looks mechanical, and the compiler cannot see any of
it. Each item below has bitten this codebase at least once:

**1. A quoted value silently disappears.** `You are cloning the rule group
'{name}'.` renders the literal text `{name}` - the apostrophes make ICU quote
the braces. Grep the diff for a quote or apostrophe next to a placeholder.
`catalog-icu.spec.tsx` fails on this, so if that spec is weakened or deleted,
push back.

**2. A value is dropped while hoisting.** Placeholders need names, so
`{collection.title}` usually becomes a local. Check the local holds the
**whole** expression - `props.collection.title`, not `props.collection`. A
truncated hoist still compiles and still renders *something*.

**3. A sentence loses a fragment.** Where copy was assembled from a ternary or
a trailing conditional, confirm every branch survived as its own message.
Count the interpolations in the original and in the new message.

**4. Strings that were never wrapped at all.** JSX text is the easy half.
Copy also hides in shapes a naive scan misses: `setError({ message })`,
`showSuccess(\`...\`)`, zod `.min(1, 'msg')`, object literals, and default
parameter values. Assume some are still unwrapped. Sweep the touched files for
every string and template literal rather than trusting the JSX was the job.

**5. Something got translated that must not be.** See the do-not-translate
list above. Units, notation and anything whose translation could disagree with
a number beside it are the dangerous ones.

**6. A translation frozen at import.** Anything computed outside render, in a
default parameter, or inside a `useMemo` whose deps do not change with the
locale will keep serving the first language loaded.

**7. A translation that changes what the app does.** The rule at the top of
this file. Trace each newly wrapped value: stored, sent, parsed, compared, used
as a key, or listed in a hook's dependencies means the wrap is wrong, however
right the rendered text looks. English hides all of it, so every spec still
passes.

**8. A message shape that will be expensive to change.** A msgid is the
contract translators work against. Renaming a placeholder, splitting a
fragment, or merging duplicates after the fact discards the translations
already made for the old shape across every locale, and a plural rewrite will
not even fuzzy-match. Get the shape right before it ships; adding a missed
string later costs nothing.

**9. A test that cannot fail.** A spec asserting English text passes whether
or not the string is wired up, because an untransformed macro and an empty
catalog both yield the source. Before trusting a new i18n guard, break the
thing it guards and watch it go red.

**Verify in the browser, not only in specs.** A spec proves a string resolves
against a catalog it built itself; only the app proves the shipped catalogs,
the `.po` compilation and the locale switch work together. Put a sentinel in a
`msgstr` in `sv.po`, switch the language in Settings, confirm it renders, then
restore the catalog. `yarn i18n:verify` automates that round trip.
