# AGENTS.md

You're an AI agent working on this repo. It's part of
[The Librarian](https://github.com/code-ministry-ltd/the-librarian) — a portable
memory + handoff layer for AI agents, open source, designed for
production use by people we'll never meet. Read this before your first
commit. Follow it on every change.

## 1. What this repo is

The Librarian itself — the MCP server, the durable-memory storage,
the cross-harness handoff surface, the Next.js admin dashboard, the
CLI, and the five harness integrations (Claude Code, Codex, Hermes,
OpenCode, Pi) under `integrations/`. pnpm monorepo on Node 22.
This is the canonical source of truth for the cross-harness slash
commands and the memory state model documented in §2. The former
standalone plugin repos
([Claude Code](https://github.com/JimJafar/the-librarian-claude-plugin),
[Codex](https://github.com/JimJafar/the-librarian-codex-plugin),
[Hermes](https://github.com/JimJafar/the-librarian-hermes-plugin),
[Pi](https://github.com/JimJafar/the-librarian-pi-extension)) are
being archived (rethink D14) — never add new work there.

## 2. House rules

### Be honest about what you ran

Never claim "tests pass" without running them. Never say a build works
because it "should." If a step was skipped, say so. If something is
unverified, label it. Your next session, and every contributor reading
your PR, inherits whatever you said — make sure it's true.

### Privacy beats convenience

This is The Librarian. Privacy is the product, not a feature. Private
mode (the in-conversation `[librarian:private=on|off]` marker, rethink
D11) stops all memory writes — never bypass it, never "just for
debugging." Bearer tokens go in headers, never in URLs or logs or
error messages. The private-mode contract is shared across the primer,
`docs/slash-commands.md`, and every integration's command templates —
change all of them or none.

### Fail-soft, never block the user's turn

A Librarian / network / parse failure must never throw out of a harness
hook, never block a prompt from reaching the model, never leak a stack
trace into the model's context. Log to the local sidecar, return the
no-op response, move on. The Librarian server can be down for an hour
and the user's day shouldn't notice.

### The cross-harness contracts are sacred

Everything now lives in this one repo (rethink D14 — the old five-repo
coordination rule is dead), but these contracts stay consistent across
every harness surface under `integrations/` and the server in the same
PR. Never invent new ones unilaterally:

- **The protocols.** The primer (`vault/primer.md`, default content in
  `packages/core/src/primer.ts`) is the **canonical definition** of the
  handoff / takeover / learn / private-mode protocols (rethink D9). The
  slash commands (`/handoff`, `/takeover`, `/learn`, and the local-only
  `/toggle-private`) are optional sugar over it — contract in
  [`docs/slash-commands.md`](./docs/slash-commands.md), templates in
  each integration's command files. Change the primer, the doc, and the
  templates together or not at all.
- **Memory state model:** memories are `active | proposed | archived`.
  The retired verbs (`confirm_memory`, `reject_memory`,
  `resolve_conflict`) are gone for good — proposals are accepted or
  rejected by the admin via the dashboard (tRPC), never by an agent
  MCP call.
- **Handoff document shape:** five required headings — `Start & intent`,
  `Journey`, `Current state`, `What's left`, `Open questions`. The
  schema refuses documents missing any of them.
- **The 7-verb MCP surface:** `recall`, `remember`, `flag_memory`,
  `store_handoff`, `list_handoffs`, `claim_handoff`,
  `search_references` — pinned by the tool-registry test and the
  healthcheck. The Hermes/Pi adapters mirror the schemas and
  descriptions verbatim (drift-guard tests pin them); a server-side
  tool change must update them in the same PR.

### Respect your consumers

Open source means people depend on what we ship. Treat that with care.

- **Every PR is a release. Bump the version and write the CHANGELOG
  entry in the same PR.** There is no `## [Unreleased]` section — file
  your notes under a new dated `## [X.Y.Z] — YYYY-MM-DD` heading at the
  top of `CHANGELOG.md`, add its `[X.Y.Z]:` compare-link at the bottom,
  and bump the root `package.json` to match (PATCH / MINOR / MAJOR per
  [`docs/release.md`](./docs/release.md)). Every merge to `main` bumps
  the version — even an internal refactor or doc fix takes a PATCH. The
  merge itself cuts the tag + GitHub release automatically
  (`.github/workflows/release.yml`); the `check:release` guard fails any
  PR that leaves an `[Unreleased]` section, forgets the bump, or desyncs
  the version from the top CHANGELOG entry.
- **Error messages teach.** "Invalid input" is not an error message.
  "Expected ISO-8601 timestamp, got '2026-13-99'" is. Assume the
  reader is new and tired.
- **README is the contract.** If it says one-liner install, that has
  to work on a fresh machine. If it claims a feature, the feature
  exists.

### Open a PR, never push to main

Always branch and PR. One change per PR. Conventional commit subject
(`<type>(<scope>): <subject>`) and a body that explains the *why*; the
diff explains the *what*. When an AI agent meaningfully contributed,
include a `Co-Authored-By:` trailer.

### Releases

There is no separate "cut a release" step — **merging to `main` IS the
release.** Every PR bumps the root `package.json` and adds its dated
CHANGELOG entry; on merge, CI tags `vX.Y.Z` and publishes the GitHub
release automatically. You never create a release branch or hand-run
`git tag` / `gh release` for the monorepo — the workflow does it, and
trying to do it by hand just races the automation. The bump-size rule
(PATCH / MINOR / MAJOR) and the full mechanics live in
[`docs/release.md`](./docs/release.md); the runbook (one version for
the whole monorepo, what publishes where, integration-surface notes)
is at [`docs/release-runbook.md`](./docs/release-runbook.md). Read
those before you pick a version.

### Tests are part of the change

Bug fix? Write a regression test first that fails, then make it pass.
New behaviour? It has tests. Trivial doesn't exempt it. Test names
describe behaviour, not function names — `"a second claim on the same
handoff returns the existing claim"` beats `"test_handler_3"`. Flakey
tests are bugs; don't paper over with retries.

### Docs are part of the change

A user-facing change isn't done until its documentation is updated in the
**same PR** — the same discipline as tests and the CHANGELOG. "User-facing"
means anything a person installs, configures, sees, or reads about: CLI
commands and flags, the MCP verbs and their schemas, dashboard pages and flows,
install / deployment / auth steps, harness setup, the slash commands, or any
behaviour the docs already describe. Changed one of those and touched no docs?
The PR is incomplete — update the relevant user-facing docs (`README.md`,
`DEPLOYMENT.md`, the integration READMEs, `docs/`; the
[docs site](https://librarian-docs.codeministry.net) is the canonical home),
or state in the PR why none was needed.
Internal-only work — refactors, tests, build plumbing — is exempt, but still
takes its CHANGELOG PATCH.

### Never commit secrets

Tokens, API keys, passwords — they live in environment variables or
the user's secret store, never in code, tests, fixtures, or commit
messages. Bearer tokens never appear in stderr, log files, error
responses, or telemetry. `redirect: "error"` on every outbound HTTPS
call that carries credentials, so a 3xx can't leak the token
cross-origin.

**Secret-SHAPED test fixtures (redaction/crypto tests) trip GitGuardian.**
The GitGuardian GitHub App scans *every commit in a PR* and reads its
ignore config from the **default branch** — so a PR-branch
`.gitguardian.yaml` ignore can't take effect pre-merge, and adding a
later fix-commit doesn't help (the commit that introduced the literal is
still scanned). The reliable fix: keep secret-shaped strings out of
committed *source* — assemble them at runtime from short, sub-threshold
parts (`` `${kw} = "${val}"` ``, `"0123456789abcdef".repeat(4)` for a
64-hex key) — then **squash** so no commit in the branch contains the
literal. Known triggers: `api_key="…"` / `password="…"` assignments and
64-hex `resolveSecretKey("…")` literals; low-entropy `token="dummy-…"`
slips through. The `.gitguardian.yaml` `ignored-paths` list is still
worth keeping for post-merge scans + the local ggshield/pre-commit path.

### Don't touch what you don't understand

Comments that say "this is here because of X," tests asserting
non-obvious invariants, ostensibly-dead code with a `// HACK:` or
`// race:` nearby — read them twice. Most of the surprising code in
this family exists because of a real race or a real exploit. Verify
with the human before deleting "obvious dead code."

### When unsure, ask

You don't get points for confidence. You get points for being right.
Surface trade-offs instead of guessing: *"option A is faster but
loses event ordering on a crash; option B is durable but slower —
which matters here?"* Asking makes you a better collaborator, not
a worse one.

## 3. Build, test, verify

```sh
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm run lint            # eslint + prettier
pnpm run typecheck       # tsc --noEmit across every workspace
pnpm test                # full vitest suite
pnpm run smoke           # end-to-end against a real local server
pnpm run healthcheck     # local /mcp + dashboard probes
```

Run commands from the repo root unless you mean to scope to one
workspace (`pnpm --filter @librarian/<pkg> …`).

## 4. Gotchas (repo-specific)

- **`lefthook` runs prettier + eslint on every commit.** Don't
  `--no-verify`; fix the lint instead.
- **Completed specs leave the repo.** Shipped specs are moved out of
  `docs/specs/` (git history holds them) — never resurrect or edit
  them. New decisions go in `docs/specs/` or `docs/adr/`.
- **The dashboard's e2e suite uses Playwright.** Browsers install on
  first run; allow a minute.
- **Auth + secrets live in the env or the dashboard.** Never commit a
  populated `.env`.
- **Harness integrations live in-tree.** All five harness surfaces
  (Claude Code, Codex, Hermes, OpenCode, Pi) live under
  `integrations/<harness>/` in this monorepo (rethink D14); the five
  standalone plugin repos are being archived — never add new work there.
