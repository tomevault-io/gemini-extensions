## nostube

> nostube is a Nostr-based video platform built with React 18, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Vite, and shadcn/ui. Applesauce (core, relay, loaders, accounts, factory, signers) provides Nostr storage, relay pools, and signing. React Router powers navigation and Observable hooks manage Applesauce streams. Keep a single `EventStore` and `RelayPool` instance (see `src/nostr`), and wrap the app with `AccountsProvider → EventStoreProvider → FactoryProvider` as shown below:

## Project Overview & Stack

nostube is a Nostr-based video platform built with React 18, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Vite, and shadcn/ui. Applesauce (core, relay, loaders, accounts, factory, signers) provides Nostr storage, relay pools, and signing. React Router powers navigation and Observable hooks manage Applesauce streams. Keep a single `EventStore` and `RelayPool` instance (see `src/nostr`), and wrap the app with `AccountsProvider → EventStoreProvider → FactoryProvider` as shown below:

```tsx
<AccountsProvider manager={accountManager}>
  <EventStoreProvider eventStore={eventStore}>
    <FactoryProvider factory={factory}>{children}</FactoryProvider>
  </EventStoreProvider>
</AccountsProvider>
```

## Project Structure & Modules

`src/components/` hosts UI, with reusable primitives in `components/ui/`. Hooks live in `src/hooks/`, shared helpers in `src/lib/`, and nostr-specific logic in `src/nostr/` plus background work in `src/workers/`. Routing is in `AppRouter.tsx` and `src/pages/`, state providers in `src/providers/` and `src/contexts/`. Tests sit in `src/test/` and alongside modules as `*.test.ts(x)`. Static assets live under `public/`, custom ESLint rules under `eslint-rules/`, and production bundles go to `dist/`.

## Applesauce Patterns & Custom Hooks

Use `createTimelineLoader`, `createEventLoader`, or `createAddressLoader` for relay queries and always observe via `useObservableMemo` to auto-dispose subscriptions. Favor built hooks such as `useEventStore`, `useCurrentUser`, `useAuthor`, `useUploadFile`, `useNostrPublish`, and `useUserBlossomServers`. Cache-first loading and singleton access keep relay usage predictable; avoid spinning up redundant pools or stores. For profile data, rely on `eventStore.profile(pubkey)` plus a blurhash fallback, and for uploads call `useUploadFile` so Blossom auth, chunking, and mirroring stay centralized.

## MCP & Reference Docs

Context7 indexes Applesauce docs (111k+ tokens) and exposes them over MCP for in-editor lookup.

```bash
# Remote (recommended)
claude mcp add --transport http context7 https://mcp.context7.com/mcp

# Local with API key (higher rate limit)
claude mcp add context7 -- npx -y @upstash/context7-mcp --api-key YOUR_API_KEY
```

## Build, Test & Development Commands

- `npm run dev` – installs if needed and launches Vite with HMR.
- `npm run build` – runs TypeScript type checking, ESLint validation, optimized Vite bundle, plus `dist/404.html` copy for static hosts. ESLint errors will fail the build.
- `npm run test` – installs, runs `tsc --noEmit`, ESLint, Vitest, and a production build.
- `npm run typecheck`, `npm run format`, `npm run format:check` – targeted verifications.
- `npm run start` previews the build on port 8080; `npm run deploy` publishes via Surge.

## Coding Style & Naming

Use two-space indentation, TypeScript + JSX, and Tailwind utilities. Components/providers are `PascalCase`, hooks follow `useCamelCase`, helpers in `lib/` or `utils/` stay in lower camel case. Prefer `const`, arrow functions, and pure render logic. Run ESLint (`eslint.config.js` + `eslint-rules/`) and Prettier before pushing to keep imports ordered and Tailwind classes normalized.

## Testing Guidelines

Vitest with React Testing Library backs unit and interaction tests. Place files next to the code under test (`*.test.tsx`) or in `src/test/` for shared helpers. Focus on upload flows, relay interactions, cache invalidation, and rendering edge cases. Use user-focused test names, mock network calls sparingly, and run `npm run test` before every PR; `vitest --watch` is ideal for local iteration.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

Follow Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`) with ≤72 char subjects (“feat: improve playlist paging”). PRs should explain motivation, link relevant issues or nostr events, attach desktop/mobile screenshots for UI tweaks, and list the tests executed. Keep changes scoped—small, reviewable diffs merge faster.

## Security & Configuration Tips

Never log secrets; debug output is already gated by `import.meta.env.DEV`. Inject relay/storage endpoints via Vite env vars or Applesauce config rather than hardcoding them in shared modules. Use helpers such as `lib/blossom-upload.ts` for chunking and signing, update relay allowlists under `src/nostr/` when infra changes, and ensure mirroring honors existing hash + size metadata before uploading.

- When you are done with work: 1. make sure it builds. 2. run `npm run format` for prettier. 3. update the @CHANGELOG.md and 4. commmit the changes

## Behavioral Principles

### Think Before Coding

Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.

Before implementing:

- State assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them — don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

### Simplicity First

Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

### Surgical Changes

Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.

When editing existing code:

- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it — don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:

- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

### Goal-Driven Execution

Define success criteria. Loop until verified.

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:

- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:

```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```
