# AGENTS.md

Agent instructions for `terminal-weather`, an animated Rust terminal weather app with both an interactive TUI and a `--one-shot` CLI mode.

---

## Project Overview

This is a single-binary Rust 2024 project built around:

- `ratatui` + `crossterm` for terminal rendering and input
- `tokio` for async tasks and timers
- `reqwest` + `serde` for Open-Meteo, geocoding, geo-IP, and update-check HTTP calls
- `clap` for CLI parsing
- `anyhow` + `thiserror` for error handling
- Test tooling: `insta`, `proptest`, `wiremock`
- Optional local analysis tooling: `jq`, `rust-code-analysis-cli` `0.0.25`, `cargo-dupes` `0.2.1`, `cargo-llvm-cov` `0.8.5`

Two runtime paths matter:

- Interactive TUI: launched normally, with async event loop, rendering, overlays, settings persistence, and background update checks
- One-shot mode: `--one-shot`, which resolves a location, fetches a forecast, prints to stdout, and exits without entering the TUI

---

## Commands

Run this before calling work complete:

```bash
./scripts/check.sh
```

Useful variants:

```bash
./scripts/check.sh --verbose
cargo check --all-targets --all-features
cargo test --all --all-features
cargo run -- Stockholm
cargo run -- --demo
cargo run -- --one-shot Stockholm
```

Install optional tooling once for full local coverage:

```bash
cargo install --locked rust-code-analysis-cli --version 0.0.25
cargo install --locked cargo-dupes --version 0.2.1
cargo install --locked cargo-llvm-cov --version 0.8.5
# install jq via brew/apt/etc.
```

`./scripts/check.sh` classifications:

| Step | Classification |
|------|---------------|
| `cargo fmt --all -- --check` | REQUIRED |
| `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings` | REQUIRED |
| `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings -D clippy::pedantic ...` | REQUIRED |
| `scripts/complexity-gate.sh` | REQUIRED |
| `cargo check --all-targets --all-features` | REQUIRED |
| `cargo test --all --all-features` | REQUIRED |
| `cargo build --release` | REQUIRED |
| `scripts/duplication-gate.sh` | RECOMMENDED |
| `scripts/complexity-audit.sh` | RECOMMENDED |
| `scripts/coverage.sh` | RECOMMENDED |
| `scripts/file-length-audit.sh` | RECOMMENDED |

Checks that require optional tooling auto-skip with install hints.

Current local thresholds:

- Complexity gate: cyclomatic `< 20`, cognitive `< 30`, MI `>= 30`
- Complexity audit: file NLOC medium `> 500`, critical `> 1000`; function NLOC medium `> 50`, critical `> 100`
- Duplication gate: advisory by default unless `TW_DUPES_ENFORCE=1`
- Coverage gate: line `>= 85%`, function `>= 85%`, branch `>= 75%`
- File-length audit: warns on Rust files over `500` lines

Update snapshots only when UI changes are intentional:

```bash
INSTA_UPDATE=always cargo test --all --all-features
```

Do not mirror this tree mechanically in new docs or comments. It changes often.

## Architecture Contracts

State machine:

- `Loading` -> `SelectingLocation` -> `Ready` -> `Error` -> `Quit`

Core event model:

- `Bootstrap`
- `TickFrame`
- `TickRefresh`
- `ForceRedraw`
- `Input`
- `FetchStarted`
- `GeocodeResolved`
- `FetchSucceeded`
- `FetchFailed`
- `UpdateCheckFinished`
- `Demo`
- `Quit`

Important boundaries:

- `src/data/` owns HTTP DTO parsing and external API interactions
- `src/domain/` owns app-facing weather and alert types
- `src/ui/` should consume domain/app state, not raw API DTOs
- `src/update.rs` is separate from forecast fetching; do not couple update-check behavior into weather clients
- `src/lib.rs` is the split point between interactive mode and `--one-shot`

Rendering model:

- `ui::render` composes the main panels, status badge, footer/command bar, and modal overlays
- Hero rendering owns its background gradient and particle paint path
- Overlays include selector, settings, city picker, and help

Persistence/config:

- Runtime settings live in `settings.json`
- Config path precedence is `TERMINAL_WEATHER_CONFIG_DIR` -> legacy `ATMOS_TUI_CONFIG_DIR` -> `~/.config/terminal-weather/settings.json`

---

## Code Style

Match the surrounding file before introducing new patterns.

Prefer:

- typed enums over stringly flags
- `thiserror` for domain-level errors and `anyhow` for app-level propagation
- small, direct helpers over speculative abstractions
- borrowing over unnecessary cloning
- descriptive names over short names

Avoid:

- `unwrap()` / `expect()` outside tests
- dead code
- dependency additions for trivial needs
- manual snapshot editing
- mixing unrelated refactors into a focused fix

Naming:

- types: `PascalCase`
- files/modules: `snake_case`
- keep naming aligned with adjacent modules

---

## Testing

- Every non-trivial behavior change needs a test, or an intentional snapshot update
- Prefer local unit tests in the same file unless the module is already split into a dedicated `tests.rs`
- Integration flows belong in `tests/`
- Snapshot coverage lives in `tests/render_snapshots.rs`
- Do not delete tests to get green; fix the behavior or the expectation

When a UI change is intentional, update snapshots with `INSTA_UPDATE=always cargo test --all --all-features` and review the diff.

---

## Git Workflow

- Work on `main`
- Keep commits atomic
- Use commit subjects like `feat: ...`, `fix: ...`, `refactor: ...`, `chore: ...`, `docs: ...`, `test: ...`
- Never force-push unless explicitly told
- Never commit secrets, `.env`, `target/`, `.claude/`, or `.agent/`
- Run the full quality gate before committing

---

## Boundaries

Do not change these without explicit instruction:

- `Cargo.lock` version pins
- release profile tuning in `Cargo.toml`
- committed snapshots in `tests/snapshots/` unless produced and reviewed through the test flow
- real user config under `~/.config/terminal-weather/`

---

## Working Rules

For multi-step work:

- make a short plan before editing
- verify facts against the repo before changing docs or architecture-sensitive code
- prefer the smallest change that solves the real problem
- use subagents selectively for focused exploration or parallel analysis
- state assumptions and proceed unless the missing information is risky or product-significant
- fix root causes, not symptoms

Before calling work done:

- run `./scripts/check.sh`
- mention any skipped checks or missing optional tooling
- summarize behavior changes and verification clearly

If something in these instructions conflicts with the repository as checked into source, trust the source and update this file.
