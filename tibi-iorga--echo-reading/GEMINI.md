# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Echo is a Vite + React SPA — an AI reading companion for PDFs. Users open PDFs, annotate them, chat with LLMs (OpenAI/Anthropic) about document content, write structured notes in a Canvas editor, and export everything. Data is persisted to Neon Postgres (via Drizzle ORM) and Cloudflare R2 (file storage), with Clerk for authentication.

## Repository Layout

The app source lives in `app/`. All npm commands must be run from the `app/` directory.

- `app/src/App.tsx` — Main component (~670 lines), manages top-level state and orchestrates the split-view layout (PDF left, notes panel right)
- `app/src/components/` — React components organized by feature (PDFViewer/, NotesPanel/, FileSelector/, Library/, SelectionActions/, auth/, landing/, layout/, reading/, modals)
- `app/src/hooks/` — Custom hooks: `usePDF`, `useAnnotations`, `useCanvas`, `useKeyboardShortcuts`, `useLibrary`, `useUploadBook`, `useSystemSettings`
- `app/src/pages/` — Route-level pages: `SystemSettings.tsx`, `PrivacyPolicy.tsx`
- `app/src/services/` — Business logic layer:
  - `api/` — API service (`apiService.ts`) and types — all CRUD operations via Vercel serverless functions
  - `llm/` — Multi-provider LLM abstraction (`llmService.ts`, `providers.ts`, `errorSanitizer.ts`)
  - `storage/` — localStorage persistence + encrypted IndexedDB for API keys (`secureKeyStorage.ts`)
  - `dictionary/` — Dictionary lookup service
- `app/api/` — Vercel serverless API routes (books, annotations, canvas, chat, progress, settings, storage, health)
  - `_lib/` — Shared utilities (auth, db, r2, schema, casing, validate)
- `app/src/types/index.ts` — All shared TypeScript types
- `app/src/constants/version.ts` — App version constant
- `app/src/utils/` — Export (MD/PDF/TXT), PDF text extraction, filename parsing, markdown rendering
- `app/src/contexts/ThemeContext.tsx` — Dark/light mode via CSS class
- `product-context/` — Project requirements and documentation (not committed to git)

## Commands

All commands run from the `app/` directory:

```bash
npm run dev              # SPA + local API server (port 5173, with /api/* working)
npm run dev:vite-only    # SPA only (no /api/*) — useful for pure UI work
npm run build            # TypeScript check + Vite production build
npm run lint             # ESLint (errors on unused vars, warns on react-refresh)
npm run test:run         # Unit tests (Vitest, single run)
npm run test             # Unit tests in watch mode
npm run test:coverage    # Unit tests with coverage report
npm run test:e2e         # Full Playwright E2E suite
npx playwright test tests/e2e/deployment-critical.spec.ts  # Stable E2E subset (preferred pre-deploy)
npm run version:patch    # Bump patch version (also minor, major)
```

### Local dev architecture

`npm run dev` runs two processes concurrently:

- **Vite** on `localhost:5173` — serves the SPA.
- **Local API server** on `localhost:4000` — `dev/server.ts` mounts every `app/api/**/*.ts` handler as an Express route. Vite's dev server proxies `/api/*` to it (configured in `vite.config.ts`), so the SPA can call the API on the same origin just like in production.

The local API server reads env vars from `.env*` files using Vite's precedence:
`.env.development.local` > `.env.local` > `.env.development` > `.env`. Use `.env.development.local` for local-only overrides (e.g. test Clerk instance instead of production).

We do **not** use `vercel dev`. Vercel still deploys `app/api/*` as serverless functions to production unchanged; the local Express server is a dev-only mirror. This keeps local dev fast (no cold starts) and avoids env-injection conflicts with Vercel cloud env vars.

Run a single test file: `npx vitest run src/utils/filenameParser.test.ts`

Run a single E2E test: `npx playwright test tests/e2e/deployment-critical.spec.ts`

## Architecture Notes

**State management**: No Redux/Zustand — state lives in custom hooks (`usePDF`, `useAnnotations`, `useCanvas`) called from `App.tsx` and passed down via props. ThemeContext is the only React Context.

**LLM abstraction**: `services/llm/providers.ts` defines provider implementations (OpenAI, Anthropic); `llmService.ts` exposes a unified interface. `errorSanitizer.ts` strips API keys from error messages. Adding a new LLM provider means adding a provider class and registering it. API calls are made directly from the browser (client-side keys stored in encrypted IndexedDB).

**Backend**: Vercel serverless functions (`app/api/`) with Clerk JWT auth, Neon Postgres via Drizzle ORM, and Cloudflare R2 for PDF/cover storage (presigned URLs for direct browser upload/download). All API route inputs are validated with Zod schemas (`app/api/_lib/validate.ts`) — bookId params are UUID-checked, request bodies are parsed via `parseBody()`.

**Storage tiers**: (1) Neon Postgres for all structured data (books, annotations, progress, settings); (2) Cloudflare R2 for file storage (PDFs, covers); (3) IndexedDB with encryption for LLM API keys (`secureKeyStorage.ts`); (4) localStorage as a fast cache.

**Canvas editor**: Built on TipTap (rich text). Supports slash commands — `/notes` pulls in highlights from the current document.

**Path alias**: `@/` maps to `app/src/` (configured in both `tsconfig.json` and `vite.config.ts`).

## Conventions

- **Commit messages**: Conventional format — `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `chore:`, `security:`, `test:`
- **Unused variables**: Prefix with `_` to suppress ESLint errors (e.g., `_selectedText`)
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode enabled with `noUnusedLocals` and `noUnusedParameters`
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS; dark mode via class strategy
- **Install flag**: Use `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` (React 19 peer dep compatibility)

## Deployment

Pushes to `master` auto-deploy to Vercel. Always run build, lint, and tests before pushing. The `app/vercel.json` configures SPA routing (non-API routes rewrite to `index.html`) and asset caching. API routes are served as Vercel serverless functions from `app/api/`.

**Environment variables** (Vercel Production): `DATABASE_URL`, `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`, `R2_ENDPOINT`, `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `R2_BUCKET_NAME`, `VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`.

**Database schema**: Managed via Drizzle ORM (`app/api/_lib/schema.ts`). Use `npx drizzle-kit push` from `app/` to sync schema to Neon.

## Testing

- **Unit tests**: Vitest + React Testing Library. Test files colocated with source (`*.test.ts`, `*.test.tsx`). Setup in `src/test/setup.ts` mocks browser APIs (matchMedia, IntersectionObserver, ResizeObserver). Custom render with ThemeProvider in `src/test/utils.tsx`.
- **E2E tests**: Playwright in `tests/e2e/`. `deployment-critical.spec.ts` is the stable subset without external API calls.
- **Test fixtures**: `tests/fixtures/` (sample PDFs — not committed to git)
