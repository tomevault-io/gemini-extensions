# AGENTS.md

## Purpose

This document defines how **automated coding assistants** (e.g. ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, Codex-like tools) should operate within the **DocStack** monorepo.

It covers:

* Where things live (packages and responsibilities)
* How to write and document code
* How to run tests and builds safely
* What *not* to do automatically (especially cross-package tests and release builds)

The goal is to keep automated changes **consistent, safe, and idiomatic** to the existing codebase.

## Monorepo Layout & Responsibilities

DocStack is a TypeScript monorepo built around [PouchDB](https://pouchdb.com/), providing a full stack for NoSQL data management.

Automated tools should assume the following package structure and responsibilities:

### `@docstack/shared`

**Purpose:**
Shared dependencies, utilities, and types used across the monorepo.

**Guidelines for tools:**

* Place **shared logic, types, helpers and constants** here when they are used by more than one package.
* Do **not** put cross-package tests here. Shared test utilities are fine, but **test suites should live in the consuming package**.
* When updating shared types, consider the impact on:

  * `@docstack/client`
  * `@docstack/server`
  * `@docstack/react`
  * `@docstack/ui`

---

### `@docstack/client`

**Purpose:**
The bridge to the data layer for both **browser** and **Node.js** contexts.

This package includes:

* A **browser client** that can run directly in a web page and talk to the DocStack server.
* A **client node** that runs in the browser using the **same underlying technology as the server**, not only as a thin communication layer.

**Guidelines for tools:**

* Keep APIs consistent across browser and node environments where possible.
* When adding features, consider whether they must:

  * Work in browser only
  * Work in Node only
  * Or be shared between both variants
* Use `@docstack/shared` for shared types/utilities between client and server.

---

### `@docstack/server`

**Purpose:**
The backend for database management, replication, schema, and security policies.

**Guidelines for tools:**

* When changing server request/response shapes, update related types in `@docstack/shared` and consumers in `@docstack/client`.
* Do not couple server internals directly to the React or UI packages; communicate via typed contracts.

---

### `@docstack/react`

**Purpose:**
A set of production-ready **React components** built on top of `@docstack/client`.

**Build:** Webpack

**Guidelines for tools:**

* Consume only the **public API** from `@docstack/client` and types from `@docstack/shared`.
* Avoid importing server internals here.
* Make sure components remain reusable and composable; keep DocStack-specific logic in hooks/utilities.

---

### `@docstack/ui`

**Purpose:**
A standalone graphical application: the “workbench” for exploring databases, schemas, and queries.

**Build:** Webpack

**Guidelines for tools:**

* Use `@docstack/react` components and `@docstack/client` as the integration points.
* Avoid introducing direct dependencies on `@docstack/server` internals.

---

## Language & Tooling Standards

All code in DocStack is written in **TypeScript**, built with:

* **Rollup** for most libraries
* **Webpack** for `@docstack/react` and `@docstack/ui`
* **Jest** for testing

Automated tools must respect the following:

### TypeScript & Types

* Prefer **strict, explicit types**.
* Shared types belong in `@docstack/shared` when used in multiple packages.
* **Important**: For TypeScript types, interfaces and their properties, **write comments on the line immediately before the property**, not inline, to ensure IDE highlighting:

```ts
interface User {
  /** Unique identifier of the user */
  id: string;

  /** Human-readable display name */
  name: string;
}
```

### JSDoc & Comments

* All **public methods, classes, and exported objects** should have JSDoc.
* Complex procedures must document **which pattern** they apply (e.g. Strategy, Factory, Adapter, Observer):

```ts
/**
 * Resolves and executes the appropriate sync strategy for the given context.
 *
 * Pattern: Strategy
 *
 * @param {SyncContext} context - Context describing the current sync state.
 * @returns {Promise<SyncResult>} Result of the executed sync strategy.
 */
async function runSyncStrategy(context) { /* ... */ }
```

### ES Comments for IDE Rich Highlights

Where types are imported via JSDoc ES comments (for JS files or special cases), use:

```ts
/** @type {import('@docstack/shared').DatabaseConnection} */
let connection;
```

Use these where needed to enhance IDE completion, especially in non-TS contexts.

## Testing Guidelines for Automated Tools

**Test runner:** Jest

Automated tools should follow these rules:

### What to Run by Default

When modifying code in a package:

* Prefer running **only the tests relevant to that package**, for example:

  * `@docstack/client` → run its Jest suite
  * `@docstack/server` → run its Jest suite

Do **not** assume that cross-package tests should be run automatically.

### Cross-Package Tests

Tests that exercise behavior across multiple packages (e.g. client + server + UI):

* **Must NOT be run automatically by tools** unless the user explicitly asks for it.
* Tools can:

  * Suggest running these tests
  * Outline which commands to run
  * But must not trigger them by default

### Test Expectations

When adding or changing behavior:

* Extend existing Jest test suites or add new tests for:

  * New functions
  * New branches or conditions
  * Bug fixes (regressions must get tests)
* Use realistic behavior where possible; over-mocking core libraries should be avoided.

---

## Build & Release Guidelines for Automated Tools

DocStack uses:

* **Rollup** for most library packages
* **Webpack** for `@docstack/react` and `@docstack/ui`

Automated tools must respect:

### Package Builds

* When changes are made, it’s acceptable to:

  * Adjust Rollup or Webpack configs (if required by the change)
  * Ensure that the configuration remains consistent with existing patterns

### Release & Production Builds

* **Do NOT automatically produce a full release or run production builds** unless explicitly instructed by the user.
* This includes:

  * Full monorepo build
  * Version bumping
  * Packaging/publishing processes
* Tools may:

  * Generate or update build scripts
  * Provide instructions on how to run release builds
  * But leave actual execution to the human unless asked.

### Build Output Directories

* **Do NOT parse, read, or modify anything under `lib/` directories** in any package.
* The `lib/` folders contain build artifacts generated by the build pipeline (Rollup, Webpack, etc.).
* Automated tools should:

  * **Ignore** all files matching the pattern `**/lib/**/*`
  * Work only with **source files** in `src/` directories
  * Let the build pipelines handle compilation and output generation
* If you need to understand compiled output, examine the source TypeScript files instead.

## Behavioral Rules for Coding Assistants

When operating on this repository, automated tools should:

1. **Locate the right package first**

   * Changes to shared behavior → `@docstack/shared`
   * Client logic or browser/server communication gateway → `@docstack/client`
   * Backend node.js implementation logic → `@docstack/server`
   * Reusable React components → `@docstack/react`
   * End-user GUI/workbench → `@docstack/ui`

2. **Respect the architecture**

   * Do not introduce tight coupling across packages where contracts/types should be used instead.
   * Prefer sharing via `@docstack/shared`.

3. **Follow code standards by default**

   * TypeScript, JSDoc, line-above property comments, ES-type comments where needed.

4. **Be conservative with side effects**

   * Do not automatically:

     * Run cross-package tests
     * Run full production builds
     * Modify version numbers
   * Only do these when the user explicitly requests it.

5. **Keep changes localized and well-tested**

   * When you modify a function, add or update tests in the same package.
   * When you change a shared type, ensure all direct consumers compile and are updated.

This file is the source of truth for how automated coding tools should behave in the DocStack monorepo. If in doubt, prefer:

* **Local, focused changes**
* **Clear documentation**
* **Minimal unexpected automation**
