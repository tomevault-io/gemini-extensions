Operational notes for working in this repo as an autonomous agent (Claude
Code or otherwise). Designed as a load-bearing playbook: read it before
your first commit, link it from PRs that follow non-obvious workflows.

## Validation tier model

Three tiers, additive (`tier3 ⊃ tier2 ⊃ tier1`). Wall-clock + exact bug
coverage are documented in [`scripts/validate-timings.md`](scripts/validate-timings.md).
Short version:

| Tier  | When to run                                | Wall clock      | Run command                                       |
|-------|--------------------------------------------|------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| tier1 | After every code change                    | ~10s             | `make validate TIER=tier1`                        |
| tier2 | Before commit / before PR                  | ~6m              | `make validate TIER=tier2 PAHO=/tmp/paho-testing` |
| tier3 | Before tag / weekly nightly                | ~12–18m          | `make validate TIER=tier3 PAHO=/tmp/paho-testing` |

What each tier closes that the prior tier misses:

- **tier1** — compile / vet / race-light unit tests / chart lint+template.
  Catches static bugs, helm rendering issues (typoed values keys, scientific-
  notation in int fields), small-package data races.
- **tier2** — full unit suite against a testcontainer Postgres + paho v3+v5
  conformance against a single broker. Catches SQL path regressions and
  MQTT protocol shape bugs (reason codes, retain, will-delay, takeover
  ordering).
- **tier3** — multi-broker paho via kind + 60s soak smoke. Catches cross-
  pod fanout bugs, deploy-shape regressions (helm-rendered manifests
  applied to a real apiserver), sustained-load issues.

In CI:

- `ci.yml` — covers tier1's surface on every PR (vet, govulncheck, test,
  test-race, helm lint, kind-based smoke). Already green is your gate to
  merge.
- `conformance-nightly.yml` — runs tier2 daily at 03:00 UTC. Doesn't gate
  PRs; informational regression detector.
- `soak-weekly.yml` — runs an in-cluster soak (and tier3 paho multi-broker,
  best-effort) Mondays 04:00 UTC. Fails on any QoS≥1 loss/dups.

## Worktree-based parallel agent workflow

This codebase has been built with parallel agents on a worktree-per-task
model. The pattern:

1. Each task gets its own git worktree under `.claude/worktrees/agent-<short-id>/`,
   on a branch named `worktree-agent-<short-id>`. This means N agents can
   `cd` into N different working copies and edit / build / test in parallel
   without stepping on each other's files.
2. Each worktree commits independently. The parent agent merges back to
   `main` via `git merge --no-ff worktree-agent-<id>` (see commits prefixed
   `merge worktree-agent-…` in the history).
3. Boundaries between worktrees are enforced by *task scope*, not by file:
   a worktree may touch any file relevant to its task, but the parent
   agent is responsible for sequencing merges so two worktrees aren't
   both modifying overlapping hot files concurrently.

Why this pattern works for this codebase:

- pgmqtt has a small set of dense files (engine, conn, janitor) and a long
  tail of small files (helm templates, tests, docs). Mechanical work on
  the tail (helm schema additions, doc fixes, lint passes) parallelises
  cleanly. Dense files are typically owned by one agent at a time.
- The merge cost is low: most worktrees touch ≤3 files outside their core
  task. Conflicts when they do happen are usually in `internal/engine/conn.go`,
  which we treat as a critical-section file: only one in-flight worktree
  may modify it.
- Each worktree's commits stay coherent — the merge commit on main names
  what each agent landed and why.

When NOT to use it:

- If the task is "make these three changes that all touch `engine.go`":
  that's a single-agent serial task. Don't spawn three worktrees that all
  fight for the same hot file.
- If the task crosses an architectural seam (e.g. "rip out the leader and
  go leaderless"): one agent, one branch. Coordinated rewrites lose
  coherence under parallelism.

## Common pitfalls observed

These have all bitten this codebase at least once. Listed here so future
agents can pattern-match instead of re-discovering.

### Helm scientific-notation rendering of int fields

Helm renders very large ints (≥10^7) in scientific notation when the
template doesn't force an explicit string conversion. This silently
truncated `maxPacketSize: 16777216` → `1.6777216e+07` → broker parsed
as `1` due to an Atoi tolerant cast that accepted the `1` prefix and
dropped the rest.

Fix: strict `strconv.ParseUint` in `internal/config/config.go` + helm
templates that pass numeric values through `int` (not `printf`'s default).
Caught by tier1 helm template + a parsing test; both are now part of
the standard validation run.

### kubectl port-forward instability under sustained load

`kubectl port-forward` uses an in-process userland forwarder that stalls
under backpressure. Symptoms in this repo:
- Paho conformance tests against a multi-broker kind cluster flake mid-run
  with `ConnectionRefused` on every fourth or fifth re-connect.
- `cmd/soak` reports loss / dups for QoS≥1 even when the broker is healthy,
  because the publisher's PUBLISH backs up against the forwarder, then the
  forwarder closes the socket.

Fix: don't port-forward. Either:
- Run the test client *inside* the cluster (`scripts/soak-incluster.sh`).
- For local single-broker work, run the broker directly on the host
  (`cmd/pgmqttd` against a docker postgres) — no kind, no forwarder.

The in-cluster soak rig (`scripts/soak-incluster.sh`) is the canonical
way to soak-test against a kind cluster. It builds a tiny distroless
image with the soak binary, side-loads it into kind, and runs the soak
as a Pod that connects to the Service VIP directly.

### Agent over-claiming completeness

When an agent declares a task "done", that's a *claim*, not a *fact*.
This codebase has had at least three regressions where an earlier agent
asserted "tests pass" without re-running them after a refactor, including
the migration 0010 packet-cap=1 bug.

Two practices that actually help:
- The `validate.sh` tier model exists specifically so "I made a change"
  has an obvious answer to "what do I run now?". Use it. Don't substitute
  reasoning for a green tier2 run.
- "Production-ready means state, not list-cleared." When a TODO is empty,
  audit the repo for what's still rough — don't declare done just because
  the file has no unchecked boxes. (See the agent's
  [feedback memory](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code) on this if
  you have access; the rule of thumb is: if you can't articulate the bug
  class your last commit catches, you didn't actually validate.)

### Janitor tick interval changes break paho

`PGMQTT_JANITOR_INTERVAL_MS` controls how often the janitor sweeps. The
paho conformance suite has timing-sensitive tests (notably `test_will_delay`)
that assume a default tick at or below 1s. Bumping the default tick to
5s landed once and was reverted within the same session because
`test_will_delay` regressed.

Fix: keep the default at 1s. Operators who want longer intervals set the
env explicitly.

### Paho conformance flakes hide real signal in tier3

`scripts/paho-conformance.py` runs the upstream Eclipse Paho test suite.
A handful of tests are documented-flaky upstream (`test_request_response`,
`test_subscribe_options` — both have a `waitfor` race that fires on
timing) and a handful are out-of-scope for v1 (`test_subscribe_failure`
needs ACLs, `test_shared_subscriptions` is documented-out-of-scope).
Fail-fasting on any of these blocks the rest of tier3 (multi-broker
paho + soak smoke).

Fix: pass `--known-flaky` to the wrapper. The default list (set in the
script) covers the documented flakes and out-of-scope tests. Tests in
that set that fail emit a `FAIL(known-flaky)` line and are excluded
from the wrapper's exit-code calculation. Override with
`--known-flaky ''` if you want every test to be hard.

The summary line reads `v5: 24/27 passing (+3 known-flaky)` so operators
see the real signal at a glance.
