Native macOS AppKit GUI client for remote [Herdr](https://herdr.dev) servers. The chrome is cmux-like (sidebar, attention rings, GPU terminal) and maps 1:1 onto Herdr's own nouns: **sidebar folders are hosts, their children are spaces (Herdr workspaces), the strip above the terminal is the space's tabs, and a tab's panes are drawn as splits.** Herdr stays the multiplexer; this app owns no panes, agents, or layouts of its own — it renders what the server reports and asks the server to change it.

[cmux](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux) (AGPL). Rendering uses [libghostty](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty) (MIT), built by `Scripts/libghostty.sh` from the commit pinned in `Vendor/ghostty` and linked as the `GhosttyKit` binary target. The AppKit glue in `Sources/Herdglass/Ghostty/` started as [GhosttyKit](https://github.com/briannadoubt/GhosttyKit) (MIT) and is ours now.

## Layout

- `Sources/HerdrClient/` — SSH attach, Unix JSON-RPC, `terminal session control` bridge, models, split-layout tree (`Layout.swift`)
- `Sources/Herdglass/` — AppKit window, sidebar (hosts → spaces), tab strip, split container, connect sheet, Ghostty host view, ghostty-config reader (`GhosttyConfig.swift`), the chrome's type scale (`ChromeMetrics.swift`), the opt-in space keys (`SpaceKeys.swift`), settings window and macOS notifications (`AgentNotifications.swift`)
- `Sources/Herdglass/Ghostty/` — the libghostty glue: `TerminalHost` (the `ghostty_app_t` and its callbacks), `TerminalSession` (one surface), `TerminalSurfaceView` (the `NSView` and its input)
- `Tests/HerdrClientTests/` — parsing, framing, and RPC-transport tests
- `Scripts/libghostty.sh` — build `Vendor/GhosttyKit.xcframework` from the pinned ghostty; `--check` compares it with the pin
- `Scripts/dev.sh` — build `.build/Herdglass.app` and optionally `--run` (extra args pass through)
- `Scripts/release.sh` — optimized build at `.build/release-app/Herdglass.app`, `--install` to `/Applications`, optionally `--run`
- `Scripts/appicon.swift` — draws `Resources/Herdglass.icns` with CoreGraphics; the `.icns` is in git, so this runs only when the icon design changes

Entry: `HerdglassMain.swift`. Flags: `--bridge` (PTY child for libghostty), `--connect <host>` (skip the connect sheet), `--self-test <host>`, `--show-ghostty-config` (what the app took from the user's ghostty config, and the menu it produced).

## Architecture

```
GUI  --session.snapshot / events.subscribe / pane.focus-->  forwarded herdr.sock (API)
GUI  --spawns-->  Herdglass --bridge  --herdr terminal session control-->  forwarded herdr-client.sock
```

`herdr --remote` is TUI-only (cannot prefix CLI subcommands). Attach is our SSH ControlMaster:

1. `BatchMode` SSH (key must already be in `ssh-agent`)
2. Find remote `herdr` at Homebrew/mise/Nix/`~/.local/bin` — non-interactive PATH has no Homebrew
3. Ensure `herdr server`, parse `socket:` from `herdr status server`
4. Forward **both** `herdr.sock` (API) and `herdr-client.sock` (direct terminal attach)
5. Focused pane: Ghostty launches `Herdglass --bridge --target <pane> …`, which speaks NDJSON `terminal.frame` / `terminal.input` / `terminal.resize` / `terminal.scroll` / `terminal.release`
6. Scroll wheel: the GUI writes `terminal.scroll` to a per-pane FIFO (`PaneControlChannel`, path passed as `--control-pipe`) that the bridge forwards

The app is a ghostty client as much as a Herdr one, so it reads the user's own
`ghostty` config rather than inventing settings of its own: `GhosttyConfig`
snapshots the keys that describe a *window* — colours, opacity, titlebar,
`window-theme`, `confirm-close-surface`, `focus-follows-mouse` — plus the
`keybind`s for the actions this app can perform, and `GhosttyRuntime` owns the
`ghostty_config_t` everything reads from. `--show-ghostty-config` prints the lot,
including which menu shortcuts came from the config and which are ours.

`ConnectionsController` owns the window's hosts — one `SessionController` per host, each with its own SSH master, event stream and selection (space → tab → pane). Only the selected host is `isVisible`, so only its panes have bridges. `MainWindowController` turns all of that into a `SidebarModel`, a `TabBarModel` and a `SplitContainerView.Model`; `StatusStyle` is the only place agent status becomes a color or a word.

A tab's panes are all live at once: `SplitContainerView` builds nested `NSSplitView`s from the tab's split tree, one `TerminalPaneView` (and one bridge) per pane. Dragging a divider is a `layout.set_split_ratio` on the server, so the TUI and every other client see the same geometry. ⌘D / ⇧⌘D are `pane.split`, ⇧⌘arrows are `pane.focus_direction` — the GUI never computes geometry itself.

## Constraints agents should not re-break

The first four interact, and together they produced a pane that visibly reloaded
every two seconds while the window still read as "connected". Read all four
before touching `HerdrRPC` or `SessionController`.

- **The API socket is one request per connection.** Herdr answers `session.snapshot` (etc.) and immediately hangs up, so `HerdrRPC` dials a fresh socket per call. Caching it makes every request after the first throw, which the UI reads as a dropped session and reconnects. Covered by `repeatedRequestsSurviveAServerThatHangsUpEachTime`.
- **`events.subscribe` is all-or-nothing, and pane-scoped types poison it.** `pane.agent_status_changed`, `pane.scroll_changed` and `pane.output_matched` each require a `pane_id`. Including one without it makes Herdr reject the *entire* call, so the client gets no events whatsoever. Keep `HerdrRPC.eventTypes` to session-wide types only — `subscriptionListOmitsPaneScopedEvents` guards this. Check any new type against the schema first:

  ```bash
  herdr api schema --json | python3 -c "import json,sys; \
    [print(v['properties']['type']['const'], [r for r in v.get('required',[]) if r!='type']) \
     for v in json.load(sys.stdin)['schemas']['request']['\$defs']['Subscription']['oneOf']]"
  ```

- **A rejected subscription arrives as a line on the stream, not as a thrown error.** `subscribe` therefore reads the `subscription_started` acknowledgement synchronously and throws on anything else. Without that, a rejection is indistinguishable from a quiet session: the stream stays open, no event ever lands, and the poll fallback never engages. Covered by `subscribeThrowsWhenTheServerRejectsTheSubscription`.
- **Keep the poll behind the event stream.** It is not redundant: agent status is only pushed by the pane-scoped `pane.agent_status_changed`, which a session-wide client cannot subscribe to, so attention rings would otherwise depend on some other event happening to fire. `SessionController` polls every 2 s alongside events, and every 0.9 s when the server refuses to subscribe us.
- **One request at a time, on one queue, and never more than a few a second.** Every RPC a session makes goes through `SessionController.work`, a serial queue of its own, and `refreshSnapshot` coalesces: one in flight, one queued at most, and a `minimumSnapshotInterval` floor between them. Both halves are load bearing, and neither shows up locally. `DispatchQueue.global` plus one blocking request per event looks free until the socket is a forwarded one — a request then costs a round trip, `pane.updated` arrives faster than that while a pane is printing, and dispatch answers a blocked block by starting another thread. All 64 of the global pool's threads ended up parked in `HerdrRPC.request`, and the damage was nothing like a slow update: the `pane.focus` for a space the user had just clicked waited behind dozens of stale snapshots, and `⌘Q` sat for the best part of a minute in `-[NSPersistentUIManager _waitForPendingChangesToFinish]`, which needs a pool thread of its own and could not get one. `sample`ing the app during the hang says so in one line: "Dispatch Thread Soft Limit: 64 reached ... too many dispatch threads blocked in synchronous operations". Anything new that talks to the server belongs on `work` too, and `HerdrRPC`'s read timeout is what keeps one stuck reply from stopping the queue for good (`aServerThatNeverAnswersTimesOutRatherThanParkingTheCaller`).
- **`NSOutlineView` reports a selection *after* the click, not during it.** So a flag set around `selectRowIndexes` cannot tell our own push apart from the user's click: the notification for the click arrives later, finds the flag raised, and is dropped — while the snapshot that raised it has already put the selection back on the row the model still pointed at. That is the whole of "picking a space works only sometimes", and it got worse the more snapshots landed per second. `SidebarView` therefore keeps `appliedSelectionId` — the row it last selected itself — reports anything else as the user's, and refuses to push while the outline is sitting on a row it has not reported yet. Anything that syncs a view's selection from the model needs the same shape, not a flag.
- **`ssh` may not run unbounded, least of all on the main thread.** `RemoteConnection.close()` is called from `windowWillClose`, so `ssh -O exit` gets three seconds and then the app stops caring — `ControlPersist` reaps the master anyway. `ProcessRunner.run` takes a `timeout` for the same reason (`aCommandThatOutlivesItsTimeoutIsKilledRatherThanWaitedOut`).
- **An action from libghostty must have its session resolved before the hop to the main actor, not inside it.** `terminalHostAction` runs on libghostty's thread and hops with `Task { @MainActor }`; resolving `terminalSession(for:)` inside that hop is a use-after-free, because `Unmanaged.takeUnretainedValue()` is a +0 read and the tab can close in between. Closing a tab is how you hit it: an action is queued, `TerminalSession.deinit` frees the surface, and the hop then writes to a freed session's `state` — `EXC_BAD_ACCESS` at a small address in `TerminalSession.handle`, one `surface closed` line later in libghostty's log, and no crash report. Resolve it in the callback and let the resulting strong reference carry the session across the hop, which is what `terminalHostCloseSurface` twenty lines below already does.
- **libghostty ignores a surface's `command` and `env_vars`.** `ghostty_surface_config_s` has both fields, `TerminalSession.createSurface` fills them in, and libghostty drops them: the surface runs the login shell instead, so the pane showed a fresh local zsh and no bridge ever started — which reads as "my herdr session was not restored" *and* as "scrolling is broken", because the wheel handler is redirected to a FIFO nothing is reading. It is not an ABI mismatch (`working_directory`, the field before `command` in the same struct, is honoured, and the pointer is non-null at the `ghostty_surface_new` call) and not version specific (GhosttyKit 0.8.0's libghostty and every rebuild since, up to the commit in `Vendor/libghostty.version`, all drop it). The app-level config *is* honoured, so `GhosttyRuntime.useSurfaceCommand` clones the config we loaded, appends `command = shell:…`, and pushes it with `ghostty_app_update_config` before the surface exists. Everything the bridge needs therefore travels in that command line (`BridgeOptions.argv`), never in the surface environment.
- **A surface can fail to be created, and it says so by being null.** `ghostty_surface_new` returns null when the view has no screen — libghostty builds a `CVDisplayLink` from it, and `CVDisplayLinkCreateWithCGDisplays error -6661 ... display count (0)` surfaces as `error.OutOfMemory` in libghostty's log. A locked screen is enough to trigger it. So attach the view to the window *before* `session.attach`, and check `session.surface` afterwards: an unchecked nil renders as a working-but-empty terminal.
- **Scrolling cannot ride the PTY.** Everything the surface writes to the bridge's stdin becomes `terminal.input`, i.e. keystrokes for the program in the pane, and libghostty's own scrollback is empty because it only ever sees full viewport frames. Herdr owns the history and moves it only for `{"type":"terminal.scroll","direction":"up"|"down","lines":>0,"source":"wheel"|"page_key"}` — hence the FIFO side channel, and hence `TerminalPaneView` replacing the view's `scrollWheel` handler instead of letting libghostty handle the wheel. Both ends open the FIFO `O_RDWR` so an idle peer never reads as EOF. `controlChannelFramesScrollCommandsAsNDJSON` covers the framing; `lines: 0` and a bad `direction` make Herdr drop the command.
- **The bridge must put its PTY into raw mode.** libghostty hands the child a cooked terminal: `icanon` holds keystrokes until Enter (a TUI in the pane never sees an arrow key, or anything else, until you hit return), `echo` paints them locally over Herdr's frames, `isig` turns ^C into a signal that kills the bridge — its `herdr terminal session control` child then dies writing frames and prints `BrokenPipe` into the pane — and `ixon` eats ^S/^Q. `ControlBridge.enterRawMode()` does this before spawning herdr and restores the old settings afterwards. `stty -f /dev/ttysNN -a` on the bridge's tty must show `-icanon -isig -echo`.
- **The first resize of a pane arrives before the bridge can hear it, and SIGWINCH is not queued.** libghostty offers no way to say how big a new surface is — `ghostty_surface_config_s` has no size field, every surface is born 800x600 px, and the real size only reaches it when `TerminalSurfaceView.layout` pushes it, a few milliseconds after libghostty has already forked the bridge against that 800x600 grid. So the *first* thing that happens to a new pane's PTY is a resize, and it lands while the bridge is somewhere between its `TIOCGWINSZ` and arming its SIGWINCH source — a window where the signal's default action discards it. Nothing ever asks again: herdr keeps the `--cols/--rows` the bridge spawned it with, the program in the pane wraps at 47 columns, the pane draws a 400x300pt terminal in the corner of a full-size one, and only resizing the window puts it right. That is the whole of "switching spaces sometimes shrinks the terminal" — a space whose panes are no longer warm attaches new bridges, so the race is rerun on every switch that misses the cache. `ControlBridge.run` therefore reads the size once more after `startWinch`, and sends a `terminal.resize` if it has moved: a change earlier than that read is caught by the read, a change later by the source. Reproduces with a PTY child and a stand-in `herdr`: resize the PTY ~5 ms after the fork and the size is lost about half the time without that read. `bridgeResendsThePTYSizeOnlyWhenItMovedSinceTheSpawn` pins what gets sent.
- **An `NSSplitView` must never be its own delegate.** AppKit's `NSSplitViewSidebar` category answers `respondsToSelector:` by asking the delegate, so `delegate = self` recurses until the stack guard is hit — `EXC_BAD_ACCESS` in `objc_loadWeakRetained` under `-[NSSplitView respondsToSelector:]`, on a timer, from toolbar validation. `SplitNodeView` therefore keeps a separate `SplitNodeDelegate` (and must retain it: `delegate` is weak).
- **The split tree comes from `layout.export`, not from the snapshot.** `session.snapshot` has a `layouts` array, but it is flat — cell rectangles plus a list of splits — and reconstructing the nesting from rounded cell rects is guesswork. `layout.export` returns `first`/`second`/`direction`/`ratio` directly. It is a second round trip, so `SessionController` only asks when `LayoutSummary.signature` for the tab changes; polling the tree every 2 s would double the request rate for nothing.
- **Switching is not reattaching, and the difference is deliberate.** A tab or space the user picks must not respawn bridges, because a respawn *is* a reconnect: new `herdr terminal session control`, new PTY, a full repaint. Two caches make a switch a reparent instead, and both are load-bearing:
  - `SessionController.layoutTrees` keeps one `layout.export` tree per tab, and `prefetchLayouts` fills in the rest of the selected space plus where each other space would land (`preferredTab`, the same choice `selectSpace` makes), one request at a time behind the selected tab's own fetch and chained rather than one per poll. Without a tree the window draws the active pane alone and re-splits a round trip later — two rebuilds and a visible reflow for one click. A stale tree is still drawn while the refetch is in flight; a tree with a pane that has since closed is not (`usableTree`), or the pane would be a leaf with no bridge behind it.
  - `SplitContainerView` parks the panes that leave the tree instead of tearing them down: unparented, `setOnScreen(false)` so libghostty stops drawing them, bridge and terminal state intact. Bounded by `maxWarmPanes` (LRU by when the pane was last on screen), by `knownPaneIds` (a pane the server stopped reporting is gone), and by the host — `sessionKey` changing drops the lot, because only the selected host renders. `paneViews` therefore holds panes that are *not* on screen: anything counting it to decide "is this a split" or "who needs attaching" has to count the tree's panes instead.
- **`layout.set_split_ratio` addresses a divider by path, not by id.** `path` is one bool per descent from the tab's root split, `false` into `first` and `true` into `second`; `[]` is the root. `splitRatioPathsAreFirstFalseSecondTrue` pins the mapping, because a wrong path silently resizes a different divider.
- **A divider ratio may only be published from the drag itself.** `NSSplitView` reports every resize through `didResizeSubviews`, window resizes included — the same trap as the sidebar width. `SplitNodeView` instead reads the ratio after `super.mouseDown` returns, which is exactly the span of the divider's tracking loop, and re-applies the model ratio in `layout()` only when it differs from what was last applied (otherwise the layout pass fights the drag).
- **Rebuild the pane hierarchy on structure, not on ratios.** `LayoutNode.structureSignature` omits ratios; keying the rebuild on the full tree would tear down and respawn every bridge in the tab on each divider drag. `TerminalPaneView`s are cached by pane id and moved between hierarchies; a pane that left the tree is parked, not torn down.
- **The per-surface command is global, and that is still safe for several panes.** `GhosttyRuntime.useSurfaceCommand` pushes the bridge command through the *app* config before each `ghostty_surface_new`, so attaching N panes in one pass looks like a race. It is not: `ghostty_app_update_config` takes effect before the next surface is created, and a four-pane split really does produce four bridges with four distinct `--target`s (`pgrep -fl 'Herdglass --bridge'`). Attach panes on the main thread, one after another, and do not "optimise" this into anything concurrent.
- **`ghostty_config_get` writes through a `void*`, so the Swift type has to match the Zig field.** libghostty decides the type from the config field (`src/config/c_get.zig`): `bool`, `c_uint` for `u8`/`u32`, `c_short` for `i16`, `f64`, `ghostty_config_color_s` for a colour, and `const char*` for both strings *and* enum tags. Read a key into something smaller than it writes and you corrupt the stack, silently. It returns false — writing nothing — for a key the C API does not expose and for an optional that is unset, which is how `split-divider-color` says "derive one". Plain Zig structs with no `cval` are simply unreachable: that is why `mouse-scroll-multiplier` and `config-file` are not honoured, and why `theme` has to be spotted by reading the config text.
- **The config is `GhosttyRuntime`'s, and nothing else may add to it.** It builds it itself (`ghostty_config_new` → `load_default_files` → `load_recursive_files` → `finalize`) and hands it to `TerminalHost(config:)`, which is why `TerminalHost` has no config loading of its own. This is the one thing the GhosttyKit wrapper was replaced over: its host wrote a Rosé Pine theme into Application Support and loaded it *after* the user's config whenever no file in the ghostty config directory had a `theme =` line, silently overriding `background`, `foreground`, `palette`, `background-opacity` and `background-blur` — so an app reading those back got the library's opinion, not the user's. Anything that injects a default here reintroduces exactly that. `ghostty_config_load_cli_args` stays out too: our argv is `--connect`/`--bridge`, not ghostty flags.
- **A light/dark `theme` pair cannot be resolved through the C API.** libghostty chooses between the halves with its *conditional* config state, which has no C entry point, so `ghostty_config_get` always answers from the default state — `light`. `background` and `foreground` are then the light half whatever the terminal is drawing, which is why `GhosttyConfig.hasLightDarkTheme` (a text scan of the config for a `theme =` with a comma, colon or equals) switches the chrome to AppKit's semantic colours instead of guessing. The appearance is safe without it: ghostty's own `finalize` rewrites `window-theme = auto` to `system` for a pair (`Config.zig`, "theme specifying light/dark changes window-theme from auto").
- **A menu key equivalent is consumed before the surface sees the key.** So a `keybind` trigger with no ⌘/⌃/⌥ must never become one: honouring `keybind = a=…` would stop the user typing that letter anywhere in the app, and libghostty already handles those inside the surface. `GhosttyConfig.shortcut(_:_:)` drops them, along with `catch_all` and the physical keys that depend on the keyboard layout. An unbound action comes back as a zeroed trigger, i.e. physical `unidentified`.
- **`ghostty_surface_read_selection` is the untrimmed dump, not the copy action.** It reaches `Screen.selectionString` with `trim = false` (`Surface.dumpTextLocked`), so it hands back every blank cell that pads a row out to the pane's width — a paste full of trailing spaces. The clipboard belongs to libghostty's own `copy_to_clipboard` action, which formats with `clipboard-trim-trailing-spaces` (default true) and calls back into `TerminalHost`'s write-clipboard callback; `TerminalSession.copySelection` runs it as `copy_to_clipboard:plain` because the bare action defaults to `mixed` and generates an HTML payload the callback discards anyway.
- **`quit-after-last-window-closed` is deliberately not honoured.** It is readable, but ghostty's macOS default is *false* while this app has always terminated with its last window, and the C API cannot tell a default apart from a value the user typed — so honouring it would leave a Dock icon behind for everyone who never set it. Anything else with that shape (a ghostty default that disagrees with an existing deliberate choice here) needs the same judgement, not a reflex.
- **`NSSplitView.dividerColor` has no setter.** `split-divider-color` is applied by overriding the property on `SplitNodeView`, which is how AppKit intends it; assigning to it does not compile.
- Remote scripts must go to `ssh host bash -s` on **stdin**. Extra argv after the host is joined with spaces and executed by zsh, which splits on `;`.
- `HERDR_SOCKET_PATH=.../herdr.sock` makes `herdr terminal session control` open `.../herdr-client.sock`. Forward both or control fails with "No such file or directory".
- Never `FileHandle.write` to a pipe that a child may have closed; EPIPE becomes an ObjC exception and `abort()`s. Use `writeIgnoringBrokenPipe` and keep `HerdrProcess.setUp()` (SIGPIPE ignored) on every entry point.
- Never read a subprocess pipe only after `waitUntilExit()`; that deadlocks past the ~64 KB pipe buffer. `ProcessRunner` drains both streams concurrently — see `processRunnerSurvivesOutputLargerThanThePipeBuffer`.
- `LineBuffer` yields `Data`, not `String`. A non-UTF-8 frame must not end the drain loop while complete records are still queued.
- Launch from a shell (`./Scripts/dev.sh --run` or `swift run Herdglass`), not `open` / Finder, or `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` is missing.
- libghostty is arm64 macOS 14+ and an unstable C API — the pin is the `Vendor/ghostty` gitlink, and moving it is its own commit, with `Scripts/libghostty.sh` rerun and `--show-ghostty-config` diffed before and after. Building it needs Xcode's Metal toolchain (`xcodebuild -downloadComponent MetalToolchain`); zig comes down at the version ghostty pins, which is rarely the one Homebrew has.

## UI conventions

- No hardcoded colors. There are exactly two sources: the user's ghostty palette for the *terminal area* (`GhosttyConfig.terminalBackground` / `.terminalForeground`, the split divider and the unfocused-split scrim), and semantic `NSColor`s plus `StatusStyle` for everything else. The chrome stays semantic on purpose — ghostty has no opinion about a sidebar — and `window-theme` is the lever that makes it light or dark, which is why forcing the appearance is enough and tinting the sidebar is not. The sidebar's translucency comes from `NSSplitViewItem(sidebarWithViewController:)`.
- A translucent window is `background-opacity`/`background-blur`, and it only works if *everything* behind the surface is translucent too: `window.isOpaque = false`, the window background and the pane layer carry the alpha, and the blur is an `NSVisualEffectView` pinned to raw bounds so it reaches under the toolbar. An opaque layer anywhere in that stack paints the desktop back out and the setting looks ignored.
- Ghostty settings that describe a *window* are honoured; ones that describe a *pane* usually belong to Herdr instead. `confirm-close-surface` and `focus-follows-mouse` are ours to act on; scrollback, padding, fonts and splits are libghostty's or the server's. When in doubt, ask whether the GUI is the only thing that could implement it.
- The content pane is pinned to `safeAreaLayoutGuide`, not raw bounds — the window uses `.fullSizeContentView` and content would otherwise sit under the toolbar.
- Nothing inside the sidebar may have an opinion about its width. A subview pinned to both edges hugs at 250, which ties with `NSSplitViewItem.holdingPriority`, and the divider then silently refuses to drag at all — that is how `emptyLabel` froze the sidebar at `minimumThickness`. Give any such view hugging and compression resistance of 1.
- `NSSplitViewController` ignores `splitView.autosaveName`: on launch it lays the sidebar out at AppKit's default thickness and autosaves *that* over the width the user dragged to. `SidebarSplitViewController` persists the width itself, and both halves are load-bearing — it restores only once the window has a frame wide enough to honour the stored width (the first layout pass runs narrower than the restored frame and would clamp it to `minimumThickness`), and it saves only when the mouse is down with the pointer on the divider, because `didResizeSubviewsNotification` also fires for a window resize that squeezes the sidebar.
- The app's own settings are the ones neither ghostty nor Herdr can express — how this behaves as a *macOS app*. That is two today (notifications, and the size of the chrome) and should stay small: a setting that describes a terminal belongs in the ghostty config, and one that describes a pane belongs to the server.
- **No hardcoded font sizes either, and a size is never only a font.** Every font in the chrome is `ChromeMetrics.font(_:weight:)` and every length that has to keep step with one is `ChromeMetrics.length(_:)` — a sidebar row's height, a tab's fixed width, a status dot, an SF Symbol's point size. The numbers at the call sites are still the ones the app was designed with, relative to a base of 12 (the sidebar title), so the type scale stays readable in the code. Scaling the text alone is what makes the setting look broken: 20pt titles in a 42pt row clip their own subtitles, and a tab pinned at 172pt fits four characters. Views that outlive a snapshot (`SidebarView`, `TabBarView`, `PlaceholderView`) re-read on `ChromeMetrics.didChangeNotification` — an `NSOutlineView` recycles its cells by identifier, so a cell that sets its fonts only in `init` never hears about the change.
- **⌘W closes the pane in a split and the tab otherwise, and that is `close_surface`, not `close_tab`.** Both ghostty actions are honoured, on ghostty's own keys (⌘W and ⌥⌘W), because they do different things: Close is "what is in front of me" and Close Tab is the whole tab either way. `MainWindowController.closePane` is the one place that decides, from the pane count of the selected tab, and both routes confirm on `confirm-close-surface` — `unlessTrivial` asks about an agent and lets a bare shell go. Nothing moves the selection or the split tree afterwards: `pane.close` takes the pane out of the next snapshot, `settleSelection` follows whatever Herdr focused instead, and the tree is refetched because its signature moved. Herdr closes the tab itself when the pane was its last, so the GUI never has to work out which happened.
- One vocabulary, everywhere: **host** (a connection), **space** (Herdr workspace), **tab**, **pane**. The sidebar is hosts → spaces, the strip is tabs, the panes are the splits. Menu items and labels use those words, not "workspace".
- **A space and a tab are named after what is running in them, and the name Herdr reports is not enough on its own.** `SessionSnapshot.title(ofTab:)` / `title(ofWorkspace:)` are the only places that decide, and both have a trap:
  - **The agent's *name* is on `agents`, not on the pane.** A pane carries the agent *kind* (`agent: "claude"`) and `display_agent` is simply absent; the name somebody gave it (`herdr agent start reviewer …`, `herdr agent rename`) lives on `AgentInfo.name` alone, keyed by `pane_id`. A title that reads `PaneInfo` on its own can therefore only ever say "claude" — hence `agentName(forPane:)`, and hence `paneTitle(_:)` rather than `PaneInfo.displayName` wherever a title is user-facing.
  - **`TabInfo.number` is not the tab's position.** It is a stable ordinal with gaps — close the first of three tabs and the survivors read 3 and 4 while their *labels* renumber to 1 and 2 — so position is `index + 1` in `tabs(in:)` (`SessionSnapshot.position(ofTab:)`) and nothing else. Getting this wrong is not cosmetic: Herdr labels an unnamed tab with its position, so testing `label != "\(number)"` read `"2" != "3"` as "somebody named this tab", and every tab but the first stopped taking a title. Nothing draws a position any more — the strip, a sidebar row's tab list and the keyboard are all free of tab numbers — but `title(ofTab:)` still needs it to recognise Herdr's own label, so the rule outlives the numbering that motivated it. `tabPositionIgnoresTheGapsInHerdrsNumbering` and `aTabPastTheFirstStillFollowsWhatIsRunningInIt` pin it.
  - **A space says where, a tab says what.** Naming a space after the agent inside it was tried first and reads badly — the one row that should anchor you in a host becomes a second copy of the tab strip, and a space with three tabs picks one of them arbitrarily. So `title(ofWorkspace:)` is a place (a name somebody typed, else the live directory) and `tabSummaries(inWorkspace:)` is what is running, one entry per tab, on the row's second line.
  - **A space's default label cannot be told from a chosen one, only guessed at.** Herdr names a space after the directory it was created in (`herdr workspace create --cwd ~/projects/app` with no `--label` gives `app`; a home directory gives `~`), so the only test is whether the label still matches a directory the space is in (`labelLooksChosen`). It fails one way on purpose: a space still on its default label whose panes have `cd`'d elsewhere reads as hand-named and keeps the directory it started in — that is where it already was. Guessing the other way would throw away a name the user typed with no way to get it back. `aSpaceThatHasMovedKeepsTheLabelItCannotVerify` pins it so it stays a decision.
  - The cwd beats `terminal_title_stripped` in `PaneInfo.displayName` because a shell's own OSC title is `user@host:~`, which says nothing the window does not. The OSC title is a last resort, not the name.
- **A tab in the strip is a fixed width, and its close button is not in the stack.** Both are what stop the strip shuffling. An `NSStackView` drops a hidden view from its layout, so a `close` inside it made a tab 17pt wider the instant the pointer touched it and shoved every tab after it sideways — it is pinned to the trailing edge instead, and faded rather than hidden (and disabled with it, or an invisible close button is still hit-tested). And a width that follows the text moved the whole strip every time a title changed, which is now, by design, whenever an agent starts or a pane changes directory. `TabItemView.width` is the one number; the label truncates against the close button.
- **A sidebar subtitle truncates at the tail.** It is a space's tabs in order, and the first is the one most likely wanted. `.byTruncatingHead` was right when the line was a path (`…/projects/app` keeps what identifies it) and is exactly wrong for a list.
- `SidebarView.apply` and `TabBarView.apply` reload only when row identity changes and reconfigure cells in place otherwise; a full `reloadData` on every snapshot would throw away scroll position and the user's collapsed hosts.
- A sidebar row is a host or a space, and each says its state one way only: a host gets an icon (tinted when something inside wants attention) and a spinner while it dials, a space gets the status dot. A remembered but unattached host is dimmed, not hidden — selecting it is how the user dials it.
- Pane borders mean two different things: the loud ring is attention (pulsing while blocked), the quiet accent border says which pane of a *split* holds the keyboard. A tab with one pane never draws the quiet one.
- Only the selected host renders. A pane counts as read when it is on screen, i.e. in the selected tab of the visible host (`SessionController.isVisible`), so a split of four panes clears four attention flags.
- **A pane off screen says so through macOS, not through a blinking toolbar.** Herdr's own notion of a notification is a background agent changing state, and its config picks the delivery (`[ui.toast] delivery`: an in-app toast, the outer terminal, the OS, or nothing). A GUI client has no toast layer and no outer terminal, so `AgentNotifications` takes the OS route on Herdr's behalf. Three rules keep it quiet, and they are why the toolbar bell is gone rather than merely hidden: notify on the *transition* into `blocked`/`done`, never on a state that is merely still true; skip a reason a pane has already been notified about (`SessionController.notifiedReasons` — Herdr's detection genuinely flaps `blocked → working → blocked` inside a second while an agent redraws its prompt, and the bell flickering at that rate is what the notification replaces); and withdraw the notification the moment the pane is read, so `markRead` and Notification Center say the same thing. One identifier per pane (`pane-<id>`) is what makes the last two possible.
- **One window, one instance, and both halves are load bearing.** `AppDelegate` holds a single `MainWindowController` and has no action that makes another; `HerdglassMain` turns a second *process* away by handing the screen back to the `NSRunningApplication` already registered for the bundle. Neither half is enough alone: the Finder refuses a second launch but `open -n` and the binary run out of `.build` do not, and no amount of process checking stops a ⌘N. Two of anything here means two clients dialling the same remembered hosts — two SSH masters and two sets of bridges per host, disagreeing about what Herdr last said. The `--bridge` children exec the same binary and return before the check; they never build an `NSApplication`, so LaunchServices does not register them and they cannot be mistaken for a second app (`--show-ghostty-config` and `--self-test` return before it too, and stay runnable while the app is up). `new_window` and `close_all_windows` are gone from `GhosttyConfig.Action` for the same reason: a keybind cannot move a menu item that does not exist.
- **A ghostty *default* does not move a menu item that shipped with a key of its own; a `keybind` the user wrote does.** `ghostty_config_trigger` answers from the merged config and cannot say where a trigger came from, so `GhosttyConfig.isRebound` asks a second, unloaded `ghostty_config_new` for the stock trigger and compares — the same "tell a default from a typed value" problem `quit-after-last-window-closed` gave up on, solved for keybinds because there is a config to diff against. It is what lets ⌥⌘↑/⌥⌘↓ be Previous/Next Space here: ghostty's defaults put `goto_split:up`/`down` on those keys, and this window has spaces in it that ghostty has no action for, so the splits take ⇧⌘arrows instead. What a *typed* `keybind` claims, it gets — and `surrenderShortcuts` then takes that combination off whatever item was still wearing it as our own default, ghostty action or not, because two items on one key is one item silently dead. An item with *no* built-in key (Open Terminal Config) still takes ghostty's default, which is how ⌘, keeps working. A config that re-types a ghostty default cannot be told from the default, and that is the one case this gets wrong on purpose.
- Two shortcuts wanted `⌘,`: ghostty's `open_config` default and the macOS Settings key. A duplicate key equivalent in one menu is silently given to whichever item comes first, so `NSMenu.applyGhosttyShortcuts` collects what the keybinds claimed and makes anything else holding that shortcut surrender it — the user's own config wins, and Settings… goes shortcutless unless they move `open_config`. Anything new with a built-in key equivalent inherits that rule for free.
- libghostty's tick is reference counted by attached panes (`GhosttyRuntime`), not left running at 60 Hz forever.
- **A number on a row has to be a key that answers it.** Space rows used to print `WorkspaceInfo.number` in front of the name, and it decayed into noise from both ends: every host numbers its own spaces from 1, so three attached hosts drew three columns of 1, 2, 3 while only the selected host's block answered the key and the row said nothing about which block that was; and the monitor matched `number` before falling back to position, so a host whose spaces read 2, 7, 9 answered ⌥⌘3 with the row printed 9. Now `SidebarModel.Row.shortcut` carries the key already rendered, `MainWindowController` fills it in for the first nine rows of the sidebar as a whole — the running `rowsAbove` counter and `orderedSpaces` walk `connections.connections` the same way, so the nth hint and the nth key are one row by construction — both sides read the modifiers from `SpaceKeys.modifiers`, and the monitor indexes by row alone. The hint is dim and right-aligned, and `BadgeView` takes that corner when there is unread — the tooltip is where the key goes then. Anything that wants to draw a number on a row of chrome answers this first: which key is it, and does that key reach this row right now?
- **The prefix is the level.** ⌥⌘ is tabs and spaces (⌥⌘arrows to step, ⌥⌘1…⌥⌘9 to jump, ⌥⌘T for a new space, ⌥⌘W to close a tab), ⇧⌘ is the splits inside a tab, and a key that means "space" on one keystroke and "split" on the next is worse than either. The digits went to ⇧⌘ once and came back: ⇧⌘3…⇧⌘6 are the system's screenshot hotkeys, taken above the app on a stock Mac, so four of the nine answered only where Screenshots had been cleared in System Settings — the monitor was correct and looked broken, the `⌃⌥⌘arrows` lesson with a known cause. ⌥⌘ digits are the app's to take.
- **Tabs have no number, anywhere.** Not in the strip, not in a sidebar row's list of them, and no key selects one by position — `goto_tab` is no longer even read out of the ghostty config. A tab is named after what is running in it and reached by clicking it or with ⌥⌘←/→. Numbering only pays for itself when a key answers it, and once the sidebar's own numbers had to be earned that way, a strip whose fourth tab is unlabelled could not earn ⌘4.
- **⌥⌘1…⌥⌘9 are off until Settings turns them on**, and that is `SpaceKeys` — the modifiers, the nine positions, the `isEnabled` default and the notification that redraws the hints. Nine chords a client swallows before the pane sees them, and nine numbers drawn on the sidebar, both bought by a feature not every user wants; ⌥⌘↑/↓ reach the same rows, so the default costs a keystroke rather than a capability. The monitor asks `isEnabled` per keystroke instead of installing and removing itself — one answer to "is this key mine", and no window left holding a stale one — and `buildSidebarModel` asks once per model so the hints cannot start at 4. Turning it on has to number the rows in front of the user: that is what `SpaceKeys.didChangeNotification` and the `refresh` observer are for.
- Window-scoped key monitors must be removed in `windowWillClose`, or a closed window keeps swallowing ⌥⌘1…⌥⌘9.
- **A structural change takes the first responder with it, so something has to put it back.** `rebuild` unparents every pane view to re-nest it, and a closed pane or tab tears its view down; AppKit answers both by making the *window* the first responder, which is nowhere. That is one bug wearing three faces — open a split, close a split, close a tab — and in each the accent border pointed at a pane that could not take a keystroke. `SplitContainerView.restoreFocusIfLost` fills the vacancy, and only a vacancy: anything still a real view in a window keeps the keyboard, which is what stops it fighting "arrow keys browse the sidebar without stealing focus". It runs on a rebuild or a moved active pane, never on the two-second poll — on every snapshot it would pull the keyboard out of the chrome a second after the user put it there.
- **Moving between splits has to move *this client*, not just the server.** `pane.focus_direction` changes Herdr's focus and answers with the pane it landed on (`PaneFocus.focusedPaneId`); `settleSelection` only ever fills a selection that has gone *missing*, so a client that throws the answer away keeps its accent border and its keyboard exactly where they were. The keystroke then does nothing visible, and the next press asks the same question from the same pane — which is how ⇧⌘arrows looked fine for as long as nobody watched what it did. `focusNeighbour` adopts the id through `selectPane`; `no_neighbor` answers with the pane it started from, so an edge press lands on itself. Same shape as `pendingPaneId` below, and for the same reason.
- **A split has to land on the pane it just made.** `pane.split` is sent with `focus: true`, so the *server* focuses the new pane, but `settleSelection` keeps this client's selection on the pane that was split — it still exists — and the two then disagree: the border on one pane, the split the user asked for on the other. `splitSelectedPane` therefore adopts the returned id through `pendingPaneId`, the same shape as `pendingTabId` and for the same reason (the pane is in no snapshot yet).
- A bridge that exits on its own must **not** be re-attached automatically (`TerminalPaneView.detachedPaneId`); refresh would immediately respawn it and spin. Re-attaching is permission the user grants by picking the pane again, which routes through `MainWindowController.select`.
- **The sidebar's order is a rule at both levels, and neither level is "most recent" or the server's array order.** Hosts are `ConnectTarget.precedes`: `local` first — it is the one host that is not somewhere else, so it does not get shuffled in among the remotes by whatever letter it starts with — then every remote by `localizedStandardCompare`, which is alphanumeric rather than alphabetical (`box2` before `box10`, case deciding nothing) and then by session, so a host with several named sessions is one block. Computed on the way out of `RecentsStore.load()` rather than stored, so it is the same on every launch; the *stored* list stays in the order hosts were added, and `remember`'s 12-host cap is the only thing that may read it (`stored()`), because "which one falls off the end" is an age question the sidebar's order can no longer answer. `ConnectionsController.connect` inserts a new row at its place rather than appending, or a host added mid-session obeys the rule only after a restart. Spaces are `SessionSnapshot.orderedWorkspaces`, by `number` (Herdr's own stable ordinal) with the id breaking ties, because `sorted` is not stable and a tie that lands differently on each poll is the same shuffle two seconds apart. `number` is the sort key and *only* the sort key: it has gaps, so the rows are named by position the way the tab strip is, and ⌥⌘1…⌥⌘9 count rows when they are on. `localLeadsAndRemotesSortByName`, `hostOrderCountsDigitsRatherThanSpellingThem`, `sessionsOnOneHostStayTogether`, `spacesComeBackInHerdrsOwnOrder`, `spacesSharingANumberStillHaveOneOrder` and `spacePositionIgnoresTheGapsInHerdrsNumbering` pin the lot. The connect sheet's prefill is the one place that still wants "most recent", and it takes `RecentsStore.selectedHost()` rather than the head of the list.
- **A restored selection is one snapshot's worth of intent, and it belongs to `settleSelection`.** `RecentsStore.Selection` remembers the space, tab and pane per host (ids, so a server that has restarted simply misses and falls through to its own focus), plus one `selectedHost` for which host the window was showing — only one renders, so without it a relaunch restores every host's selection and then shows whichever is first. `finishConnect` reads the record into `restoring`, and the first `settleSelection` after that consumes it and clears it whether the ids fitted or not: a record that outlived one snapshot would keep pulling the window off whatever the user had since clicked. It is written from every place the selection moves (the `select*` methods *and* the settle after each snapshot), because quitting and closing the window announce themselves to nothing — and it never writes an empty selection over a real one. Restoring also pushes `pane.focus`, but only for a pane it really restored and only on the visible host: four hosts coming back at launch must not move the focus on three servers where somebody may be working in the TUI.
- **The hosts to dial at launch are written when a host comes up, never when one goes down.** `RecentsStore.attached()` is a second list beside the recents, added to by `SessionController.finishConnect` and removed from only by `ConnectionsController.disconnect` and `forget` — the two places the *user* detaches a host. It cannot be a flag that `SessionController.disconnect()` clears, because closing the window and quitting the app both tear every session down through `disconnectAll`, so the flag would be cleared by the very quit it exists to survive. Restoring also belongs to a launch with nothing named on the command line (`MainWindowController(restoringHosts:)`): `--connect somewhere` asked for one host, not for the remembered ones alongside it. Each dial carries an empty completion on purpose — a host that has gone away reports itself by its sidebar row going to `failed`, and four restored hosts must not open four modal sheets over a window nobody has touched yet.

## Verify

```bash
swift test --filter HerdrClientTests
swift build --product Herdglass
.build/debug/Herdglass --show-ghostty-config
# needs a running herdr server:
.build/debug/Herdglass --self-test local
./Scripts/dev.sh --run --connect local
```

`--show-ghostty-config` is the whole ghostty-config surface in one screen: every
key we read with the value we resolved, and every menu shortcut with whether it
came from a `keybind` or from this app. Point it at a scratch config rather than
editing the user's — ghostty honours `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`:

```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/ghosttytest/ghostty
printf 'background = #101820\nwindow-theme = light\nkeybind = cmd+e=new_split:right\n' \
  > /tmp/ghosttytest/ghostty/config
XDG_CONFIG_HOME=/tmp/ghosttytest .build/debug/Herdglass --show-ghostty-config
```

A config key that reads back as its default when the file clearly sets it is
either unexposed by the C API (`ghostty_config_get` returned false) or being
overridden by a theme loaded after it — check `ghostty +show-config` for what
ghostty itself ended up with.

A pane showing a local shell prompt (rather than the remote pane's content)
means the bridge never started. `pgrep -f 'Herdglass --bridge'` is empty and the
app has a `/usr/bin/login … /bin/zsh` child instead; libghostty's own log
(`log show --predicate 'subsystem BEGINSWITH "com.mitchellh"'`) shows
`config: default shell source=env`.

In a split, every visible pane must have its own bridge with its own
`--target` and `--control-pipe`:

```bash
pgrep -fl 'Herdglass --bridge'
pgrep -fl 'terminal session control'
```

Switching tabs must *keep* the previous tab's bridges — up to
`SplitContainerView.maxWarmPanes` of them — so coming back is a reparent and not
a reconnect. Sample `pgrep` across a few tab switches (⌥⌘←/→): the pids stay put, and
`grep -c 'terminal attach client connected' ~/.config/herdr/herdr-server.log`
does not move. A pid that changes on every switch is the old behaviour back.
What must still drop panes: closing the tab on the server, switching hosts,
Disconnect, and going past the warm cap. After any of those,
`pgrep -f 'terminal session control'` has to come back down.

Notifications need an agent status to move, and no CLI sets one — Herdr detects
it from the pane's process name and its output (`herdr agent explain <pane>`
prints the rule that fired). A fake agent is enough to drive the whole path:

```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/fakeagent
printf '#!/bin/bash\necho "Bash command"\necho "Do you want to proceed?"\necho "  1. Yes"\necho "  2. No"\nread -r _\n' \
  > /tmp/fakeagent/claude && chmod +x /tmp/fakeagent/claude
# in a space the window is NOT showing:
herdr pane run <pane> 'PATH=/tmp/fakeagent:$PATH claude'
herdr agent explain <pane>   # state: blocked, rule: bash_permission_prompt
```

The pane then goes `blocked`, one notification is posted, and switching the
window to that space withdraws it. `UNUserNotificationCenter.getDeliveredNotifications`
is the check that macOS really took it — a banner may be suppressed by a Focus
mode while the notification is still delivered.

The base font size has to move boxes as well as text, and the only way to see
that is to walk it to both ends of `ChromeMetrics.range` in Settings and look:
sidebar subtitles must not clip, tab titles must not truncate at four
characters, dots and icons must stay beside the text they belong to, and the
strip must not overlap the terminal.

Closing is two paths, and the split one is the new one:

```bash
herdr pane list | python3 -c 'import json,sys; [print(p["pane_id"], p["tab_id"]) for p in json.load(sys.stdin)["result"]["panes"]]'
```

⌘D then ⌘W must leave the tab with one pane, not close the tab; ⌘W again must
close the tab. ⌥⌘W must close the tab from a split too.

Navigation is four arrows on two levels, and `--show-ghostty-config` prints what
the menu ended up with without launching anything: ⌥⌘←/→ walk the tab strip,
⌥⌘↑/↓ walk every attached host's spaces as one list — the last space of one
host steps into the first of the next, and the sidebar selection follows — and
⇧⌘arrows move the keyboard between the panes of a split, one level down. A
`keybind` of the user's that lands on those arrows takes them, and the split
item then has no key at all rather than a key it shares — `super+shift+right=next_tab`
is the collision to try in a real config.
⌥⌘T makes a space on the selected host, and `--show-ghostty-config` is the
check that it is still the only item wearing that key. ⌥⌘1…⌥⌘9 pick a space by
its row down the *whole* sidebar, hosts included, once Settings has turned them
on, and the hint the row draws is the check: switch them on and watch the rows
number themselves, press what one says and land on it, with two hosts attached,
and see the hints run 1…9 straight through the host boundary and stop. Switch
them off and the hints go and the digit reaches the pane again.
With two hosts attached and one merely remembered, the walk must skip the
parked one rather than dialling it.

**A shortcut the menu carries is not a shortcut the app receives.** The splits
were on ⌃⌥⌘arrows first, and that combination never reached the app from a real
keyboard, though the menu held it, AppKit matched it, and synthetic key events
drove it end to end — something above the app was taking it. Synthetic events
are how the *action* gets tested here; only a hand on the keyboard tests the
*key*. Anything moved onto a new combination needs both.

Restoring hosts is a two-launch check, and `disconnect` is the half that is easy
to get wrong:

```bash
# The key prefix predates the Herdglass rename and was kept so existing
# installs keep their state; see the note in RecentsStore.swift.
defaults read dev.herdr.term herdr-term.attached   # the hosts the next launch dials
defaults read dev.herdr.term herdr-term.recents    # every host, oldest added first
```

Attach a host, quit, relaunch with no `--connect`: it comes back attached. Then
**Disconnect** it and read the key again — it must be gone, and the launch after
that must leave the row parked.

`herdr-term.recents` is *not* the sidebar's order — that is computed from it, so
the check is the sidebar itself: `local` at the top and the remotes alphanumeric
under it, the same on every launch however the hosts were added. Attaching a new
host mid-session must put its row in that order straight away, not at the bottom
until the next launch.

Coming back to the same screen is the two-launch check next to it:

```bash
defaults read dev.herdr.term herdr-term.selection      # space/tab/pane per host
defaults read dev.herdr.term herdr-term.selected-host  # the host that renders
```

Pick a space that is not the first, a tab that is not the first, and a pane that
is not the first of a split; quit; relaunch. All three come back, the keyboard is
in that pane, and `herdr pane list | grep focused` agrees. Then move Herdr's own
focus elsewhere from the TUI (or `herdr pane focus <other>`) while the app is
down: the relaunch must still land where the *app* was, and the pane it lands on
must become the focused one on the server. With two hosts restored, only the
visible one may push that focus — check the background host's `focused_pane_id`
did not move.

A pane that visibly reloads on a timer means the session is reconnecting, not
that rendering is slow. Distinguish the two:

- `~/.config/herdr/herdr-server.log` — repeated `terminal attach client connected` means the pane is being respawned.
- `pgrep -f 'terminal session control'` sampled once a second — a changing PID confirms it.
- The sidebar not reacting to `herdr workspace create` within ~2 s means events are not arriving.
