# tokf — Development Guidelines

## Project Philosophy

tokf is an open source project built for the community. We are not looking for profits — this exists for open source sake. Every decision should prioritize:

- **End-user experience** — whether the user is a human or an LLM, the tool should be intuitive, fast, and transparent about what it's doing.
- **Visibility** — users should always understand what tokf is doing. Stderr notes, `--timing`, `--verbose` flags. Never hide behavior.
- **Transparency** — clear error messages, honest documentation, no dark patterns.

## Commits

Use **Conventional Commits** strictly:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `test`, `docs`, `chore`, `ci`, `perf`, `build`

Scopes: `config`, `filter`, `runner`, `output`, `cli`, `hook`, `tracking`, `history`

Examples:
- `feat(filter): implement skip/keep line filtering`
- `fix(config): handle missing optional fields in git-status.toml`
- `test(filter): add fixtures for cargo-test failure case`
- `ci: add clippy and fmt checks to GitHub Actions`

Keep commits atomic — one logical change per commit. Don't bundle unrelated changes.

## Code Quality

### Testing
- **Minimum 80% coverage, target 90%.**
- Every module gets unit tests. Every filter gets integration tests with fixture data.
- Fixture-driven: save real command outputs as `.txt` files in `tests/fixtures/`. Tests load fixtures, apply filters, assert on output. No dependency on external tools in tests.
- **Declarative filter tests**: place test cases in a `<stem>_test/` directory adjacent to the filter TOML (e.g. `filters/git/push_test/` next to `filters/git/push.toml`). Each case is a TOML file with `name`, `inline` or `fixture`, `exit_code`, and `[[expect]]` blocks. Run with `tokf verify`. Every filter in the stdlib **must** have a `_test/` suite — CI enforces this with `tokf verify --require-all`.
- Run `cargo test` after every meaningful change. Tests must pass before committing.

### Pragmatism

We are pragmatic. The limits below are guidelines that produce better code in the vast majority of cases. When a limit actively harms readability or forces an awkward split, it can be exceeded — but this requires explicit approval from the maintainer. Document the reason in a code comment when overriding.

### Linting & Formatting
- `cargo fmt` before every commit. No exceptions.
- `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` must pass clean.
- Functions should stay under 60 lines (enforced via `clippy.toml`). Can be overridden with `#[allow()]` when approved.
- Source files:
  - **Soft limit: 500 lines** — aim to split before this. CI warns.
  - **Hard limit: 700 lines** — CI fails. Requires approval to override.

### Duplication
- Keep duplication low. If you see the same logic in two places, extract it — but only when it's genuinely the same concern, not just superficially similar.
- DRY applies to logic, not to test setup. Test clarity beats test brevity.

### Dependencies
- Use reputable, well-maintained crates instead of reinventing. Check download counts, maintenance activity, and dependency footprint before adding.
- Keep the dependency tree tight. Don't add a crate for something the standard library handles.
- Pin versions in `Cargo.toml`. Review what transitive dependencies you're pulling in.

### Design Decisions (Do Not Revisit)
- **TOML** for config. Not YAML, not JSON.
- **Capture then process**, not streaming.
- **First match wins** for config resolution. No merging, no inheritance.
- **Passthrough on missing filter.** Never block a command because a filter doesn't exist.
- **Exit code masking (default on).** tokf exits 0 and prepends `Error: Exit code N` on failure, to avoid output duplication in Claude Code. Use `--no-mask-exit-code` to propagate the real exit code.
- **Variant delegation, not inheritance.** Parent filters delegate to child filters via `[[variant]]` — the child filter replaces the parent entirely, it doesn't inherit or merge fields.
- **Two-phase variant detection.** File detection (pre-execution) takes priority; output-pattern matching (post-execution) is the fallback. Parent config applies when no variant matches.

## Build & Run

```sh
cargo build              # Build
cargo test               # Run all tests
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings  # Lint
cargo fmt -- --check     # Format check
```

### Database & end-to-end tests

`tokf-server` uses CockroachDB. DB integration tests and end-to-end tests are `#[ignore]`d by default — they require `DATABASE_URL` and the `--ignored` flag.

Copy `.env.example` → `.env` to configure `CONTAINER_RUNTIME` (`podman` or `docker`) and `DATABASE_URL`.

```sh
just db-start                  # start CockroachDB
just db-status                 # check if running
just db-setup                  # create tokf_test database
just test-db                   # tokf-server integration tests
just test-e2e                  # end-to-end tests
just test-all                  # unit + DB + e2e
just db-reset                  # wipe and restart fresh
```

Or manually:

```sh
podman compose -f crates/tokf-server/docker-compose.yml up -d
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://root@localhost:26257/tokf_test?sslmode=disable"
psql "postgresql://root@localhost:26257/defaultdb?sslmode=disable" \
  -c "CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS tokf_test"
cargo test -p tokf-server -- --ignored
cargo test -p e2e-tests -- --ignored
```

Each `#[crdb_test]` creates an isolated database per test with fresh migrations — no manual migration step needed.

## Documentation

**Every user-facing feature or behaviour change must be documented in the same PR.**

### README generation

`README.md` is **generated** — do not edit it directly. Changes made directly to `README.md` will be overwritten by the pre-commit hook.

The source files live in `docs/`:
- `docs/_readme/header.md` — top of the README (badges, intro)
- `docs/_readme/footer.md` — bottom of the README (acknowledgements, licence)
- `docs/*.md` — individual sections, ordered by `order:` frontmatter

To update documentation, edit the appropriate file in `docs/` and then regenerate:

```sh
bash scripts/generate-readme.sh   # regenerate README.md
```

The pre-commit hook runs this automatically on every commit, so staged changes to `docs/` will be reflected in `README.md` in the same commit.

### What to document

- New filter fields → add to `docs/writing-filters.md`.
- New CLI flags or subcommands → add to the relevant `docs/*.md` section.
- Changed behaviour (e.g. how piped commands are handled) → update the relevant `docs/*.md`.
- New runtime behaviours visible to LLMs or end-users → document with a concrete example showing input and output.
- Significant new features → consider adding a dedicated section with a short explanation and a code/shell example.

Documentation lives in `docs/` (end-user reference) and `CONTRIBUTING.md` (contributor guide). Do not open a PR that adds or changes behaviour without also updating these files.

## What Not To Do

- Don't add features beyond what the current issue asks for.
- Don't implement streaming, hot-reloading, HTTP registries, GUIs, parallel execution, output caching, or advanced linting. These are explicitly deferred.
- Don't sacrifice user experience for implementation convenience.
