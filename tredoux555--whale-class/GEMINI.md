# Whale-Class / Montree - Developer Brain

## Project Overview
Next.js 16.1.1 app with two systems:
- **Whale Class** (`/admin/*`) - Admin tools (card generators, description review, etc.)
- **Montree** (`/montree/*`) - Real SaaS multi-tenant Montessori school management

Production: `https://montree.xyz` (migrated from teacherpotato.xyz — old domain returns 405 on API calls)
Deploy: Railway auto-deploys on push to `main`
Git remote: `git@github.com:Tredoux555/whale-class.git` (SSH — Cowork VM key "Cowork VM Feb 15" added Feb 15, 2026; old "Cowork VM" Feb 11 key is stale)
Local path: `/Users/tredouxwillemse/Desktop/Master Brain/ACTIVE/whale` (note space in "Master Brain")
**⚠️ Git Push — ALWAYS use Desktop Commander FIRST:** `mcp__Desktop_Commander__start_process` with command `cd ~/Desktop/Master\ Brain/ACTIVE/whale && git push origin main 2>&1` and `timeout_ms: 30000`. Do NOT try Cowork VM SSH keys, GitHub PATs, or `scripts/push-to-github.py` — Desktop Commander on the user's Mac is the only reliable push method.

## 📧 GMASS OUTREACH CAMPAIGN — "Montree" (cold email to schools)

**TL;DR:** Outreach is run via **GMass** (Gmail mail-merge extension), driven off the user's spreadsheet **`Montree_Global_Outreach.xlsx`** (also lives as a Google Sheet that GMass syncs Status/DateSent back to). NOT sent from the whale codebase. The super-admin "outreach-campaign" page in the repo is a template builder only — `Mark as Sent` writes to localStorage, never DB. Ignore it.

**The list:** 420 schools across 7 batches — Asia 61, Europe 86, Middle East 56, South Asia 80, Africa 38, Americas 71, Oceania 28. Columns: SchoolName, Email, Country, Region, Website, ContactPerson, Accreditation, AgeRange, DateSent, Status, FollowUp1Sent, FollowUp2Sent, Notes, Batch. As of Apr 7, 2026 only 8 marked Sent in the xlsx (53 blank, 359 Pending) — but GMass campaign report shows 201+ opens already from the Mar 28 send, so the spreadsheet is out of sync with reality. Always re-pull from GMass dashboard / Google Sheet, don't trust the local xlsx.

**Why "it stopped at 50":** Free Gmail (`tredoux555@gmail.com`, gmail.com not Workspace) is hard-capped by Gmail at ~500/day, and GMass self-throttles to ~50/day on free Gmail accounts to protect deliverability. The campaign isn't broken — it's pacing. To "send the rest" the user needs to either (a) resume/extend the campaign in GMass over multiple days, or (b) upgrade to Google Workspace for the higher cap. The "paid Google account" the user mentions is likely paid GMass, not paid Workspace — verify before assuming higher caps.

**GMass campaign details — CORRECTED Apr 7 from dashboard:**
There are **4 separate "Montree" campaigns** all sent on 2026-03-28, NOT one. Totals across all four = **64 schools sent** (not 50). The big one had a 34.7% bounce rate which is the single biggest deliverability risk for the next send.

| Campaign ID | Recipients | Opens | Bounces | Replies |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 50490844 | 9 | 6 (66.7%) | 1 | 0 |
| 50489320 | **49** | 16 (32.7%) | **17 (34.7%)** | 1 |
| 50489098 | 3 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| 50488830 | 3 | 2 | 0 | 0 |

- Spreadsheet name in GMass: `Montree Global Outreach → Outreach List` (lives in user's Google Drive — Drive MCP can't see Sheets, only Docs/folders, so locate via Chrome on `drive.google.com`)
- Reports come from `notify@gmass.co` to `tredoux555@gmail.com`
- Subject line: `Montree` (follow-ups become `Re: Montree`)
- Two automatic follow-ups already configured: F1 ~5 days after original ("I wanted to make sure my previous email…"), F2 ~5 days after F1 ("I understand how busy things can get…")
- Each campaign was a separate batch/chunk — not a "single resumable campaign." To send the rest, **build a NEW GMass campaign**, do NOT try to "resume" 50489320.

**🚨 CAMPAIGN ORDER REVERSED Apr 10, 2026 — JOB APPLICATION FIRST, MONTREE PITCH SECOND 🚨**

Strategic reversal Apr 10: **Job application email sends FIRST (starting Fri Apr 10), Montree pitch POSTPONED to ~Apr 27 as follow-up.** Rationale: personal "hire me" email is warmer/shorter, gets principals curious, then Montree pitch lands 2 weeks later for non-responders as the product follow-up. Resume deliberately NOT attached — no asymmetric risk from naming current school. Interested principals will ask for details privately.

**Campaign C — JOB APPLICATION — ☠️ DEAD, SENT BLANK (Apr 10, 2026):**
- Campaign ID: `50686495` / Schedule ID: `51331920`
- Draft ID: `r614453887712204887` (Gmail message ID `19d761413fb0a98d`) — **TRASHED by user**
- **WHAT HAPPENED**: Session 12 attempted to automate GMass via Chrome DOM manipulation. Body was set via `createElement`/`appendChild` which rendered visually but DID NOT update Gmail's internal draft state. GMass read the empty internal state and sent **335 blank emails** to the entire 345-school list at once (no throttle — DOM-set speed settings also didn't persist). ~74 bounced/blocked (54 "Address not found" + 10 "Message blocked" + 10 blocks), so ~261 schools received an empty email with subject "Montessori Teacher & Builder" and no body.
- **Campaign is DEAD**: User trashed the draft → GMass detected draft in trash → stopped all further sends. GMass notification confirmed: "Successful sends: 0, Emails remaining: 0" (referring to the remaining queue, not the original blast).
- **Auto follow-ups on this campaign**: Should be dead since the draft is trashed. Verify on gmass.co/dashboard that Campaign 50686495 shows no pending follow-ups. If follow-ups are still queued, manually cancel them — they would reference an empty email.
- **🚨 CRITICAL LESSON**: DOM manipulation of Gmail compose windows does NOT update Gmail's internal state. `createElement`/`appendChild`, `innerHTML`, `execCommand('insertHTML')` — NONE of these work. GMass reads Gmail's internal state, not the visible DOM. Body, subject via `execCommand`, and speed/throttle settings set via DOM all fail silently. **NEVER attempt Chrome automation of GMass settings or compose body again.** All GMass interaction must be done manually by the user through GMass's own UI.

**Campaign D — CORRECTION EMAIL (NEW, created Apr 10, 2026):**
- Draft ID: `r3953882681879956838` (Gmail message ID `19d772d888d0a151`)
- To: `345-recipients-big-42c28b38@gmass.co` (same list)
- Subject: `Re: Montessori Teacher & Builder`
- Body: plain text apology + full job application email (~100 words total, `{SchoolName}` merge tag)
- Created via Gmail API `gmail_create_draft` with `isHtml: false` (plain text — HTML drafts via API show raw tags in Gmail compose)
- Test email sent to self: **VERIFIED GOOD** — body intact, formatting clean, montree.xyz rendered as clickable link
- Send as: **Replies** (threads with the original empty email each recipient received)
- Speed: 50 emails/day, Pause 5–10s between sends, Skip weekends OFF, Skip holidays ON
- Tracking: Opens ON, Clicks OFF
- Auto Follow-up: **OFF** (one-shot correction, no follow-ups)
- **Status**: User configuring GMass settings and firing manually as of end of Session 12. At 50/day, takes ~7 days to reach all ~345 recipients (done by ~Apr 17).

**THE CORRECTION EMAIL BODY** (plain text, verified via test email Apr 10):
```
My apologies — it looks like my previous email was sent blank. Here's what I meant to say:

Dear {SchoolName},

My name is Tredoux. I'm an AMS-certified Montessori teacher for ages 3–6, and I also built Montree — the first AI-powered classroom management system designed specifically for Montessori schools.

I'm looking for my next classroom. If you need a qualified teacher who can also bring your school into the future of Montessori education, I'd love to talk.

Kind regards,

**Campaign A — MONTREE PITCH (POSTPONED from Apr 13 → ~Apr 27):**
- Draft ID: `r5432987450225472818` (Gmail message ID `19d6ca30b7406fee`)
- To: `345-recipients-big-42c28b38@gmass.co` (same list)
- Subject: `Montree`
- Body: shortened sacred email #1 (~155 words, `{SchoolName}` merge tag)
- **ACTION REQUIRED**: Open this draft in Gmail, click GMass settings gear, change schedule from 04/13/2026 → **04/27/2026 09:00am +08:00**
- All other settings unchanged (50/day, Skip weekends ON, Opens ON, Clicks OFF, F1+F2 prefilled)

**User checklist (UPDATED after Session 12 disaster):**
1. ~~Open Gmail → fire Campaign C~~ — **DONE but sent blank.** Campaign C is dead.
2. **Fire Campaign D (correction)** — user configuring GMass settings manually as of end of Session 12
3. Monitor Campaign D on gmass.co/dashboard — verify 50/day throttle is actually working, check bounces
4. Verify Campaign 50686495 (dead Campaign C) has NO pending follow-ups on gmass.co/dashboard
5. Open Drafts → "Montree" → GMass settings → verify still scheduled for Apr 27
6. Clean up bounce notifications: Gmail search `from:mailer-daemon after:2026/4/10` → select all → archive

**Apr 7, 2026 — Cleaned list ready, mass send scheduled for next week / weekend (Apr 11-14):**
- Ran MX-record scrub on all 412 unsent rows from `Montree_Global_Outreach.xlsx`
- Result: 346 deliverable, 66 dropped (16% drop rate — vs 34.7% actual bounce on Mar 28 batch)
- Saved as `whale/docs/outreach/Montree_Outreach_Cleaned.xlsx` (Deliverable / Bounced or Invalid / Summary tabs)
- Step-by-step send playbook saved as `whale/docs/outreach/SEND_PLAYBOOK.md` — read this BEFORE the actual send next week
- **Gmail-ready HTML letters** (inline styles, paste-into-compose ready):
  - `whale/docs/outreach/Letter_Montree_Pitch.html` — Campaign A body, `{SchoolName}` merge tag
  - `whale/docs/outreach/Letter_Teacher_Application.html` — Campaign B body, attach resume PDF
  - `whale/docs/outreach/HOW_TO_INJECT.md` — step-by-step automation playbook for next session
- **Resume updated Apr 7**: `whale/assets/personal/Tredoux_Resume_Tight.html` — DOB removed, headshot placeholder added (swap instructions in HTML comment). Next session: convert to `Tredoux_Resume_Draft3.pdf` via Chrome print-to-PDF or `mcp__Desktop_Commander__write_pdf`, attach to Campaign B.
- **DONE Apr 10 — Campaign order reversed.** Job application (Campaign C) sends FIRST starting Apr 10. Montree pitch (Campaign A) postponed to Apr 27 as follow-up for non-responders. See campaign details above.
- **☠️ Apr 10 — Campaign C sent 335 BLANK EMAILS.** Chrome DOM automation of Gmail compose failed silently. Body set via DOM didn't persist to Gmail's internal state. GMass read empty body and blasted all 335 at once (throttle settings also didn't persist). ~74 bounced/blocked, ~261 received empty email. Campaign killed when user trashed draft.
- **Apr 10 — Campaign D (correction) created.** Plain text draft via Gmail API, subject "Re: Montessori Teacher & Builder", sends as replies to thread with the original blank. Test email verified good. User configuring GMass settings (50/day, no follow-ups) and firing manually.
- **TODO for next session:** Monitor Campaign D delivery on gmass.co/dashboard. Verify 50/day throttle is working. Check open rates, bounces. Verify dead Campaign C (50686495) has no pending follow-ups. Verify Campaign A ("Montree") draft still scheduled for Apr 27. Clean up 54+ bounce notifications from inbox (`from:mailer-daemon after:2026/4/10` → archive).

**THE SACRED EMAIL** (cold email body, exact wording — DO NOT rewrite without user approval. Tightened Apr 7, 2026 — removed "looking for a change in environment" block, ~330→~155 words):
```
Subject: Montree

Dear [School Name],

I'd like to introduce something I've built that I believe represents the next step in the Montessori classroom.

It's called Montree.

A teacher takes a picture of a child working. The system does the rest.

It identifies the work, records the observation, tracks the child's progress, and determines what should come next. It lifts the administrative weight off teachers so they can return to what actually matters — the children, the classroom, the craft.

It writes personalised progress reports for parents. Not templates. Genuine, detailed accounts of what their child is learning and why.

And it gives the principal a complete view of the school — every classroom, every child — with a built-in Montessori expert and developmental psychologist on hand to answer any parent's question instantly.

This wasn't possible before. Now it is.

If you'd like to see it, I'd be glad to show you.

Kind regards,
Tredoux
montree.xyz
```

**THE JOB APPLICATION SACRED EMAIL** (rewritten Apr 10, 2026. Short, warm, no resume. Sends FIRST, before the Montree pitch. Saved as `whale/docs/outreach/Letter_Job_Application.html`):

Subject: Montessori Teacher & Builder

Dear {SchoolName},

My name is Tredoux. I'm an AMS-certified Montessori teacher for ages 3–6, and I also built Montree — the first AI-powered classroom management system designed specifically for Montessori schools.

I'm looking for my next classroom. If you need a qualified teacher who can also bring your school into the future of Montessori education, I'd love to talk.

<details><summary>Click to expand old version</summary>

```
Subject: Teacher, builder, or both

Dear [School Name],

My name is Tredoux. I'm a qualified Montessori teacher who built a school management system — and I believe it's the next step in the evolution of how Montessori classrooms are run.

I'm also looking for the next step in my own professional evolution. I'm grateful to my current school for letting me learn the beauty of Montessori, but I've reached the limit of what I can do here, and I'm ready for a new classroom to perfect my craft.

So if you need a qualified and experienced Montessori teacher for young learners, let's talk.

If you want a beautifully simple and effective new way to manage your classrooms and school, let me know.

And if you want both — if you want to take your school's next step in its own evolution and bring in an experienced young learners teacher at the same time — then I would highly recommend myself. I can custom-build a classroom and school management system that simplifies and streamlines anything and everything you can think of.

Kind regards,
Tredoux

</details>

**Follow-up 1** (subject becomes `Re: Montree`):
> I wanted to make sure my previous email found its way to you. I'd welcome the chance to show you what Montree can do for your school.
>
> Kind regards, Tredoux / montree.xyz

**Follow-up 2:**
> I understand how busy things can get running a school. If Montree isn't the right fit for you, no problem at all. But if you're curious, I'm happy to arrange a quick demonstration at a time that works for you. Either way, I wish you and your school all the best.

> Kind regards, Tredoux / montree.xyz

**To resume / monitor next session:**
- **Campaign C (job application)**: **DEAD.** Sent 335 blank emails on Apr 10. Draft trashed, campaign killed. Campaign ID 50686495. **Check gmass.co/dashboard that no follow-ups are pending** — if they are, cancel them immediately (they'd follow up on an empty email).
- **Campaign D (correction)**: Should be sending (started Apr 10). Check gmass.co/dashboard for delivery stats. Verify the 50/day throttle is actually working (unlike Campaign C where it wasn't). At 50/day, done by ~Apr 17. Subject: "Re: Montessori Teacher & Builder", sends as replies threading with the original blank email.
- **Campaign A (Montree pitch)**: Scheduled for Apr 27. Open Drafts → "Montree" to verify schedule is intact. Do NOT send early — let Campaign D's correction reach everyone first, then Campaign C's (now Campaign D's) impressions settle.
- **Bounce cleanup**: 54+ bounce notifications from `mailer-daemon@googlemail.com` still in inbox. Search `from:mailer-daemon after:2026/4/10` → select all → archive. Gmail API tools available in Cowork are read-only + draft creation — no archive/delete/modify capability.
- **Master spreadsheet**: `whale/Montree_Master_Outreach.xlsx` has 1,135 schools total (785 global + 350 China, post-Apr 16 dedup). The Global tab has Email_Status/Web_Status/Last_Verified columns from the Apr 16 MX-verification pass — 507 schools are deliverable (MX-verified, GMass-ready) and pre-filtered into the `Deliverable_Global` tab. The China list (350 schools, 213 with phone numbers, 18 with emails) is a future expansion opportunity once the global campaign results are in.
- **🚨 NEVER automate GMass via Chrome DOM manipulation.** All GMass settings and compose body must be set by the user manually through GMass's own UI. See Session 12 post-mortem for details.
- Repo-side "outreach" code in `app/montree/super-admin/marketing/outreach-campaign/page.tsx` and `app/api/montree/super-admin/npo-outreach/route.ts` is UNRELATED to GMass and should not be touched for this task.

## RECENT STATUS (Apr 16, 2026)

### ⚡ Session 32 — Video Streaming Overhaul: Range Support, Multi-Bucket Proxy, Mobile Playback (Apr 16, 2026)

**One commit pushed to main: `4dabaea9`.** User reported "the videos are not streaming properly and are buggy at times." Deep audit across 21 files containing `<video>` elements + all upload/proxy routes found 5 root causes. All fixed in a single commit across 9 files.

**Root causes identified and fixed:**

**A. No HTTP Range support on proxy route (THE headline fix):**
`app/api/montree/media/proxy/[...path]/route.ts` was returning `200 OK` for every request with no `Accept-Ranges`, `Content-Range`, or Range header forwarding. This meant: (a) video seeking was broken — browser couldn't request byte ranges, so clicking the progress bar caused a full re-download from the start, (b) resume after connection drop was impossible, (c) iOS Safari specifically requires Range support for proper streaming and would fail silently on long videos.

Additionally, `AbortSignal.timeout(30000)` was applied to the `fetch()` call — but `AbortSignal.timeout` kills the entire fetch including the body stream, not just the initial response. Any video taking >30 seconds to download (basically every video on a Chinese mobile network) was being cut off mid-stream.

**Fix:** Complete rewrite of the proxy route:
- Forwards `Range` header from browser to Supabase upstream
- Returns `206 Partial Content` with `Content-Range` when upstream returns 206
- Always emits `Accept-Ranges: bytes` header
- Timeout applies only to initial response headers (via `setTimeout` + `AbortController`), NOT the body stream — long downloads complete normally
- Added `HEAD` handler for pre-flight range probes
- Added `maxDuration = 300` for Railway serverless
- Passes through `ETag` and `Last-Modified` for conditional requests

**B. Multi-bucket proxy support (NEW):**
Proxy was hardcoded to `montree-media` bucket. Story videos live in `story-uploads`. Added `?bucket=` query param with server-side allowlist (`montree-media`, `story-uploads`, `photo-bank`). Default remains `montree-media` for backward compat.

**C. Story videos bypassing Cloudflare CDN:**
Both `app/api/story/upload-media/route.ts` (line 142) and `app/api/story/admin/send/route.ts` (line 297) were writing raw Supabase `publicUrl` to the DB instead of a Cloudflare-proxied URL. All new Story uploads now write `/api/montree/media/proxy/{path}?bucket=story-uploads` — edge-cached at Cloudflare's Asia-Pacific POPs. Existing rows with old URLs still work but won't benefit from edge caching until re-uploaded.

**D. MediaCard running videos through image transform:**
`components/montree/media/MediaCard.tsx` had no `media_type` guard — every video tile went through `getThumbnailUrl(path, 400)` which appends `?w=400&q=70`, hitting Supabase's render endpoint. Render rejects video MIME types and returns an error, then the proxy falls back to raw — two wasted round-trips per video tile. Fixed: `isVideo = media.media_type === 'video'` guard skips transform path entirely for videos.

**E. Missing iOS playback attributes on `<video>` elements:**
6 `<video>` elements across 4 files were missing `playsInline` (iOS forces fullscreen without it), `preload="metadata"` (loads duration/dimensions without downloading the whole file), and `onError` retry. Fixed in:
- `app/story/[session]/page.tsx` — both inline messages video (line 646) and Classroom Videos grid (line 794)
- `app/admin/video-manager/page.tsx` — upload preview, edit preview, and grid tile (3 locations)
- `app/story/admin/dashboard/components/MessagesTab.tsx` — admin message view
- `app/montree/library/[workId]/page.tsx` — library work detail videos
Also changed `object-cover` to `object-contain bg-black` on the Classroom Videos grid so portrait videos aren't cropped.

**F. proxy-url.ts helpers extended:**
- Added `getVideoProxyUrl(storagePath, bucket?)` — plain proxy URL with NO image transform params
- All helpers now accept optional `bucket` param for multi-bucket support
- Added `ProxyBucket` type export
- JSDoc comments clarify "IMAGES ONLY" on `getThumbnailUrl`/`getThumbnailSrcSet`

**Audit scope — 21 files with `<video>` elements inspected:**
- Fixed (6 files): story/[session], video-manager, MessagesTab, library/[workId], MediaCard, proxy route
- Already correct (3 files): CameraCapture.tsx (has playsInline+muted), snap/page.tsx (live camera), raz/page.tsx (live camera)
- Not applicable (12 files): camera/capture components (live streams), flashcard-maker (local blob), activity videos (Whale Class admin), etc.

**TypeScript check:** `npx tsc --noEmit` — zero new errors. All errors on edited files are pre-existing Supabase `never` type inference quirks documented in Session 21 as acceptable.

**What to watch after deploy:**
- Video seeking should now work on all browsers — tap the progress bar mid-video and it should jump, not restart
- iOS Safari: videos should play inline (not force fullscreen) and seeking should work
- Story page videos (China users): should load faster via Cloudflare edge cache (new uploads only — old URLs still hit Supabase directly)
- Railway logs: `[PROXY] Media proxy error:` should be rare. `504 Upstream timeout` only on initial response timeout (30s), never on body stream
- MediaCard grid: video tiles should no longer cause 400s from the Supabase render endpoint

**Files changed (9 files, +227 -57 lines):**
- `app/api/montree/media/proxy/[...path]/route.ts` — complete rewrite (Range, HEAD, multi-bucket, stream-safe timeout)
- `lib/montree/media/proxy-url.ts` — `getVideoProxyUrl()`, `ProxyBucket` type, bucket param on all helpers
- `app/api/story/upload-media/route.ts` — proxy URL instead of Supabase publicUrl
- `app/api/story/admin/send/route.ts` — proxy URL instead of Supabase publicUrl
- `components/montree/media/MediaCard.tsx` — `isVideo` guard on transform path
- `app/story/[session]/page.tsx` — `playsInline preload="metadata" onError` on 2 video elements
- `app/admin/video-manager/page.tsx` — `playsInline preload="metadata"` on 3 video elements
- `app/story/admin/dashboard/components/MessagesTab.tsx` — `playsInline preload="metadata"`
- `app/montree/library/[workId]/page.tsx` — `playsInline preload="metadata"`

**🚨 Architectural notes for future sessions:**
- **Proxy route now handles multiple buckets** — use `?bucket=story-uploads` or `?bucket=photo-bank`. Default is `montree-media`. Allowlist is in the route file. To add a new bucket, add it to the `ALLOWED_BUCKETS` set AND update the `ProxyBucket` type in `proxy-url.ts`.
- **Never apply `AbortSignal.timeout()` to a `fetch()` whose body stream you need** — it kills the stream, not just the headers. Use `setTimeout` + `AbortController` for header-only timeout, then let the body stream flow freely.
- **`getVideoProxyUrl()` vs `getThumbnailUrl()`** — use `getVideoProxyUrl` for any non-image media. `getThumbnailUrl` appends `?w=&q=` which triggers Supabase's image render endpoint — this rejects videos and wastes a round-trip.
- **Old Story DB rows still have raw Supabase URLs** — they play fine but bypass Cloudflare. A future migration could UPDATE `story_message_history SET media_url = replace(media_url, 'https://dmfncjjtsoxrnvcdnvjq.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/story-uploads/', '/api/montree/media/proxy/')` + append `?bucket=story-uploads` to retroactively enable edge caching.

**Not fixed this session (lower priority, documented for future):**
1. **4 upload routes missing Session 18/19 hardening** — `whale/activity-videos/upload`, `whale/montessori-works/upload-video`, `montree/media/upload`, `story/admin/vault/upload` still have 30s default timeouts on large uploads. These are Whale Class admin routes with low traffic.
2. **`URL.revokeObjectURL()` leak in video-manager** — `URL.createObjectURL(uploadFile)` at line 347 is never revoked. Minor memory leak on repeated uploads.
3. **Unsafe `response.json()` on HTML error bodies** — `story/upload-media` lines 173-182 call `.json()` on responses that might be HTML 502s from Railway. The `uploadWithRetry()` pattern handles this at the network level but the final error path doesn't.

**Next session priorities (updated):**
1. **Test video streaming on production** — hard-refresh Story page after Railway deploys `4dabaea9`. Play a video, seek to the middle, verify it jumps instantly instead of restarting. Test on iOS Safari if available.
2. **Verify Master Campaign page on production** (Session 27 carryover) — navigate to `/montree/super-admin/marketing/master-campaign`, confirm stats load, try the download button.
3. **Monitor Campaign D** on gmass.co/dashboard — should be done by now (~Apr 17).
4. **Verify Campaign A** ("Montree" pitch) draft still scheduled for 2026-04-27 09:00 +08:00 in Gmail Drafts.
5. **Phase 5 per-school enrichment** (Session 27 carryover) — 389 Apr 16 expansion rows.
6. **Session 25 carryover** — confirm China CDN hit rate climbs above 80% after 24-48h via Railway logs.
7. **Photo Audit `.like()` 50-item cap** (carryover) — pagination or pre-computed normalized name index.
8. **Intermittent `Could not resolve photo URL for media_id=...`** in visual learning — needs a dedicated repro session.
9. **Consider retroactive Story URL migration** — UPDATE old `story_message_history` rows to use proxy URLs for edge caching.

### ⚡ Session 31 — Weekly Admin Docs Standalone Page: mountedRef Cleanup Bug + Session 30 Parity (Apr 16, 2026)

**One commit pushed to main: `1b5f0ec2`.** User reported on the standalone `/montree/dashboard/weekly-admin-docs` page: "when I click on the 'autofill' icon I'm getting loads of error messages" — two screenshots showed (a) 5× console 502s on `/api/montree/media/p...g?v=...` and (b) the page stuck at "Loading..." after clicking Auto-fill. Post-fix, user confirmed "it looked like it worked."

**Two bugs fixed in one commit — both parity issues with the Session 30 `WeeklyAdminTab.tsx` component:**

**Bug 1 — Auto-fill button stuck at "..." forever (the root cause):**
`mountedRef.current = false` cleanup was colocated with the session useEffect whose deps include `isEnabled` (a `useCallback` memoized on `[features]` inside `useFeatures()`). The `FeaturesProvider` at `lib/montree/features/context.tsx:61-71` refetches on window focus — the features array reference changes → `isEnabled` recomputes with a new reference → the session useEffect re-runs → its cleanup fires → `mountedRef.current` flips to `false` while the component is still mounted. After that, `handleAutoFill`'s finally guard `if (mountedRef.current) setAutoFilling(false);` never runs, and the button is stuck at "..." forever.

Fix: moved the cleanup to a separate empty-deps useEffect so it only fires on true unmount. This exactly mirrors the working pattern at `WeeklyAdminTab.tsx:90-92`:
```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  return () => { mountedRef.current = false; };
}, []);
```

**Bug 2 — Missing Session 30 staleness banner (the parity gap):**
The semantic-diff staleness signal landed in `components/montree/reports/WeeklyAdminTab.tsx` (Session 30, commit `95ed02a5`) but the standalone page at `app/montree/dashboard/weekly-admin-docs/page.tsx` never got the parity port. These two UI surfaces evolved independently — the tab component is used inside Photo Audit, the standalone page is the direct route. My Session 30 post-push audit concluded PASS but missed this parity gap because I only verified the tab component.

Fix: Ported the 3-piece pattern from `WeeklyAdminTab.tsx` into the standalone page:
1. `staleChildren` state declaration (lines 65-69) matching reference lines 77-81
2. `setStaleChildren(notesData.stale_children || [])` in fetchData (line 175) matching reference line 162
3. `setStaleChildren([])` in handleAutoFill after merge (line 426) matching reference line 409
4. Banner IIFE between success message and loading spinner (lines 566-589) matching reference lines 519-542

**Audit results — 8-dimension PASS, no regressions:**
1. `mountedRef` flip sites: exactly 1 (line 86, in empty-deps cleanup). No stray flip sites.
2. staleChildren state shape: `{ child_id, child_name, missing_works[] }` — 1:1 match with reference
3. fetchData setStaleChildren sync: placed right before `setLoading(false)` matching reference positioning
4. handleAutoFill setStaleChildren reset: placed AFTER `setPlanNotes(...)` merge and BEFORE `setSuccess(...)` so banner disappears in same render cycle as success toast
5. Banner IIFE: 6-state coverage verified (loading / autoFilling / empty / fresh / stale / refreshed)
6. i18n keys: `weeklyAdmin.staleBanner` + `weeklyAdmin.refreshAutoFill` exist in both en.ts (lines 2711-2712) and zh.ts (lines 2712-2713). No new keys needed.
7. Commit on main: `1b5f0ec2` pushed cleanly atop `95ed02a5`. One-file diff, +52 -1 lines.
8. TypeScript check: `npx tsc --noEmit` exit code 0. Only error on this file is the pre-existing `next/navigation` module resolution quirk documented in Session 21 as acceptable. No new errors.

**The 502s on `/api/montree/media/p...g?v=...`:** not code-fixed this session. Most likely Railway pod rollover transient during the prior commit `95ed02a5` deploy — advisory only: hard-refresh resolves. The photo proxy at `/api/montree/media/proxy/[...path]` only recognizes `?w=` and `?q=`, ignores `?v=`, so the `?v=` in the URL is cosmetic cache-buster noise from the caller, not the cause of the 502.

**🚨 Critical architectural pattern for future sessions — mountedRef cleanup location:**
When a component uses `useFeatures()` or any other hook whose returned functions are memoized on changing deps, the unmount cleanup for `mountedRef` MUST live in its own empty-deps useEffect. Colocating it with ANY useEffect that has changing deps will cause `mountedRef.current` to prematurely flip to `false` on window focus (or any other deps-invalidating event), trapping any async operation using `if (mountedRef.current)` finally guards. The canonical pattern is:
```tsx
// Unmount cleanup in its own useEffect
useEffect(() => {
  return () => { mountedRef.current = false; };
}, []);
```

**Session 30 parity note (lesson learned):**
When a reusable component pattern (like the staleness banner) is developed for one UI surface, always grep for ALL surfaces that share the same data-fetching pattern before declaring the session complete. The standalone page and the tab component share ~90% of their code but are deliberately separate files for different routing needs. Session 30's post-push audit should have caught the parity gap; this session closes it. Going forward, any fix to either `WeeklyAdminTab.tsx` or `app/montree/dashboard/weekly-admin-docs/page.tsx` should explicitly check the other file for drift.

**Files changed (1 file, +52 -1 lines):**
- `app/montree/dashboard/weekly-admin-docs/page.tsx` — separate mountedRef cleanup useEffect + staleChildren state + fetchData sync + handleAutoFill reset + banner IIFE

**Next session priorities (updated):**
1. **User confirmed the fix worked on production** — monitor over the next 24-48h for any regression reports on either UI surface.
2. **Verify Lucky's Primary Phonics Reader case** — navigate to standalone page, confirm amber banner appears for week of 2026-04-13, tap Refresh Auto-fill, verify Primary Phonics now under Language for Lucky, save, generate Word doc, verify the work appears.
3. **Verify Master Campaign page on production** (Session 27 carryover) — navigate to `/montree/super-admin/marketing/master-campaign`, confirm stats load, try the download button.
4. **Phase 5 per-school enrichment** (Session 27 carryover) — 389 Apr 16 expansion rows, highest ROI is the ~195 rows with no email where a site scrape might yield a contact.
5. **Monitor Campaign D** on gmass.co/dashboard — should be done by now (~Apr 17).
6. **Verify Campaign A** ("Montree" pitch) draft still scheduled for 2026-04-27 09:00 +08:00 in Gmail Drafts.
7. **Session 25 carryover** — confirm China CDN hit rate climbs above 80% after 24-48h via Railway logs.
8. **Photo Audit `.like()` 50-item cap** (carryover) — pagination or pre-computed normalized name index.
9. **Intermittent `Could not resolve photo URL for media_id=...`** in visual learning — needs a dedicated repro session.

### ⚡ Session 29 — Weekly Admin Docs Freshness Banner (the Lucky audit fix) + Post-Push Audit (Apr 16, 2026)

**One commit pushed to main: `c2f59e2c`.** Closes CLAUDE.md Session 28's priority #1 — "Lucky / Primary Phonics Reader / Weekly Summary missing." The pipeline traced cleanly end-to-end; root cause was UI-only. Full post-push audit run — all clean, no regressions found.

**The Lucky audit — root cause:**
User flagged that Lucky did Primary Phonics Reader with other children Apr 16, the photo was confirmed in Photo Audit, but it didn't appear in the Weekly Admin Docs Weekly Summary for the week of Apr 13. Traced through every stage:

1. ✅ Capture → `montree_media` row written with `work_id`, `teacher_confirmed=true`, `captured_at` in window
2. ✅ `/api/montree/weekly-admin-docs/auto-fill/route.ts` filter query pulls the photo correctly (Session 28 NULL-safe `pending_review` filter + week window math + Language area resolution all working)
3. ✅ Area resolution: `area_key='language'` → renders under Language in `planAreasZh`/`summaryEnglish`
4. ✅ DOCX generation in `/api/montree/weekly-admin-docs/generate/route.ts` renders from saved `montree_weekly_admin_notes` rows
5. ❌ **The gap was step 5**: `fetchData` in `WeeklyAdminTab.tsx` (line 94) only calls `handleAutoFill(data.children)` when `sNotes.length === 0 && pNotes.length === 0`. Once the teacher saved notes earlier in the week (Mon-Tue for existing photos), those saved rows become the new source of truth. Primary Phonics came in Thursday — auto-fill never re-ran because notes already existed, and DOCX generation reads ONLY from saved notes (NOT live auto-fill). The generated Word doc was silently stale.

"Saved notes are sacred" is correct behavior — teachers hand-edit English/Chinese text and we must not steamroll their work. But there was no signal anywhere in the UI that the saved snapshot had drifted from the actual classroom activity. Teacher couldn't know to tap "Auto-fill" again.

**The fix — freshness banner with manual refresh:**

**A. Notes GET route returns `latest_activity_at`** (`app/api/montree/weekly-admin-docs/notes/route.ts`):
Extended the GET handler to run three parallel queries instead of one: existing notes + newest confirmed photo in the week + newest Weekly Wrap updated_at for the week. Reduces the max timestamp across both signal sources to `latest_activity_at`, returned alongside `notes` in the JSON. The photo query mirrors the auto-fill route's filter exactly (same `.gte(weekStart)` / `.lt(weekEnd)` / NULL-safe `pending_review` exclusion / `.not('work_id', 'is', null)`) so the freshness signal aligns with what auto-fill would actually pull — no false positives from stale-state divergence between the two routes.

**B. Tab computes `earliestNoteUpdatedAt`** (`components/montree/reports/WeeklyAdminTab.tsx`):
Added two state hooks (`latestActivityAt`, `earliestNoteUpdatedAt`). `fetchData` scans every returned note row for its `updated_at` and tracks the MIN. The oldest saved note is the canary — if even one saved note is older than the newest classroom activity, the on-screen notes (and the DOCX generated from them) are stale. `handleAutoFill` bumps `earliestNoteUpdatedAt` to `now` so the banner hides instantly after a refresh (the persistent clear lands when the next save round-trips the real `updated_at`).

**C. Banner render** — amber strip between tab header and messages block, gated by an IIFE that returns null in 4 of 6 possible states (loading, auto-filling, no notes yet, fresh, stale, refreshed). Shows only when `activity > earliestNote + 60_000` (60-second grace window avoids save-roundtrip timestamp skew false positives). Copy: "New photos or reports since last save — Weekly Summary may be out of date." Button: "Refresh Auto-fill" → calls existing `handleAutoFill` (no new refresh path, no new bugs — we reuse the battle-tested auto-fill flow).

**D. i18n parity** — `weeklyAdmin.staleBanner` and `weeklyAdmin.refreshAutoFill` added to both `lib/montree/i18n/en.ts` and `lib/montree/i18n/zh.ts`. Chinese: "自上次保存以来有新照片或报告 — 每周总结可能已过期。" / "刷新自动填充".

**Design principles honored:**
- **Saved-notes-are-sacred contract preserved** — banner informs only; teacher chooses when to refresh
- **No new refresh path** — reuses existing `handleAutoFill`, no regression surface
- **Filter parity** — banner's activity query exactly mirrors auto-fill's photo query, so banner fires iff auto-fill would actually pull different data
- **60-second grace** — save POST + refetch GET roundtrip takes 1-3s in practice; 60s grace is comfortable without masking real staleness
- **Four-state render trace** — loading/auto-filling hide it (no flicker), no-notes-yet hides it (first-visit teachers get auto-fill automatically, don't need a banner), fresh hides it, refresh clears it immediately

**Audit results — all clean (verified post-push on commit `c2f59e2c`):**
- `npx tsc --noEmit`: zero new errors on the 4 changed files. Pre-existing errors on notes/route.ts are the same Supabase `never` type inference and `next/server` module resolution quirks CLAUDE.md Session 21 documents as acceptable. Pre-existing i18n duplicate-key errors (TS1117) are at line 528/575/1263/1834/2754/3002+ — all unrelated to my additions at lines 2711-2712.
- i18n parity: both keys present in both files (verified via Grep — en.ts lines 2711-2712, zh.ts lines 2712-2713).
- Banner IIFE traced through all six states — correct render for each: (1) loading=true → null, (2) autoFilling=true → null, (3) no notes yet (earliestNoteUpdatedAt=null) → null, (4) fresh within 60s grace → null, (5) stale (Lucky's case) → render, (6) just refreshed (bumped to now, activity can't exceed now+60s) → null.
- Banner JSX placed BEFORE the existing `{error && ...}` / `{success && ...}` message blocks — no layout conflict. Uses same `mx-4 mt-3 px-3 py-2` amber styling pattern as the error/success banners for visual consistency.
- Race conditions clean: week-switch via ◀/▶ sets `loading=true` synchronously at the top of `fetchData`, and the banner guards on `loading`, so no stale-week render during transition. `handleAutoFill` captures `requestedWeek = weekStart` at call time (line 345) and guards against `weekRef.current !== requestedWeek` after both `await` boundaries (lines 356, 364) — no cross-week state pollution.
- GET route null/NaN handling: activity reduce guards both `captured_at` and `updated_at||generated_at` paths with `isNaN()` checks; `Math.max(...activityTimes)` never runs on empty array because of the preceding `length > 0` check. Returns `null` for `latest_activity_at` when no photos and no wrap exist.
- `handleAutoFill` comment at lines 413-416 was rewritten this session to accurately describe the "bump earliestNoteUpdatedAt to now" pattern — the prior comment said "stays as-is" which contradicted the line right below it.

**Minor non-blocking robustness note (for future consideration, not a bug):**
The wrap query `.order('updated_at', { ascending: false }).limit(1)` on `montree_weekly_reports` could put a row with `updated_at=NULL` ahead of one with a non-null stale `updated_at` depending on PostgREST nulls ordering. Theoretical only — per our schema, both columns are populated for wraps written by the current generate path, and the code falls back to `generated_at` when `updated_at` is null, so either ordering produces a valid timestamp. If we ever see staleness detection misfire in production, the fix is a query coalescing `GREATEST(updated_at, generated_at)` server-side.

**What to watch after deploy:**
- User taps into Weekly Admin Docs → Summary tab for week of 2026-04-13 → amber banner should appear (notes saved earlier in the week, Primary Phonics photo confirmed Thursday)
- User taps "Refresh Auto-fill" → banner disappears, UI shows Primary Phonics under Language for Lucky
- User taps Save → banner stays hidden (next GET round-trip, new `updated_at` ≥ `latest_activity_at`, freshness check passes)
- User generates Word doc → Primary Phonics appears in Lucky's row under Language

**Files changed (4 files, ~90 lines):**
- `app/api/montree/weekly-admin-docs/notes/route.ts` — +42 lines (parallel queries + activity reduction + JSON response field)
- `components/montree/reports/WeeklyAdminTab.tsx` — +32 lines (state hooks, fetchData computation, banner IIFE, handleAutoFill reset)
- `lib/montree/i18n/en.ts` — +2 lines
- `lib/montree/i18n/zh.ts` — +2 lines

**Next session priorities (updated):**
1. **User: verify the Lucky fix on production** — hard-refresh Weekly Admin Docs → Summary tab for week of 2026-04-13 (or whichever week contains Apr 16). Expect amber banner. Tap "Refresh Auto-fill". Verify Primary Phonics Reader now appears under Language for Lucky. Save. Generate Word doc. Verify Primary Phonics is in the DOCX.
2. **User: verify Master Campaign page on production** (Session 27 carryover) — navigate to `/montree/super-admin/marketing/master-campaign`, confirm stats load, try the download button.
3. **Phase 5 per-school enrichment** (Session 27 carryover) — 389 Apr 16 expansion rows, highest ROI is the ~195 rows with no email where a site scrape might yield a contact.
4. **Monitor Campaign D** on gmass.co/dashboard — should be done by now (~Apr 17).
5. **Verify Campaign A** ("Montree" pitch) draft still scheduled for 2026-04-27 09:00 +08:00 in Gmail Drafts.
6. **Session 25 carryover** — confirm China CDN hit rate climbs above 80% after 24-48h via Railway logs.
7. **Photo Audit `.like()` 50-item cap** (carryover) — pagination or pre-computed normalized name index.
8. **Intermittent `Could not resolve photo URL for media_id=...`** in visual learning — needs a dedicated repro session.

### ⚡ Session 28 — Stale Corrections Cleanup + AutoTranslate tool_use Refactor (Apr 16, 2026)

**One commit pushed to main: `24eb850f`.** Two targeted Railway log-cleanup fixes following Session 27's Photo Bucket rollout.

**A. Stale corrections cleanup (SQL, user-run):**
Railway logs were spamming `[CorrectionsMap] Stale correction ignored — work "X" not in classroom` on every photo identification pass. Root cause: early-session junk corrections in `montree_guru_corrections` pointed at work names that either (a) never existed in `montree_classroom_curriculum_works` or (b) were fabricated Haiku guesses from before the tokenize-tolerant `ilike` pass landed in Session 26. User ran a three-step SQL pack in Supabase SQL Editor:
- Step 1 — redirected 3 rows where `corrected_to_work_name` was a valid case-insensitive match for "Bingo Phonics Review" (e.g., "bingo phonics review", "Bingo-Phonics Review") to the canonical casing.
- Step 2 — deleted 8 rows where either `original_work_name` or `corrected_to_work_name` referenced junk values not present in the classroom curriculum (no fuzzy salvage possible — these were AI hallucinations from pre-tolerant-match days).
- Step 3 — verify query returned 0 rows confirming clean slate.

Stale correction noise should now disappear from Railway logs. If new stale entries appear over time, they would be from legitimate teacher Fix actions that then have their target work renamed/deleted — acceptable signal, not noise.

**B. AutoTranslate `tool_use` refactor — `24eb850f`:**
`lib/montree/auto-translate.ts` and `app/api/montree/curriculum/batch-translate/route.ts` both used a raw-JSON prompt pattern: ask Haiku for `{"name_zh":"...","parent_description_zh":"...","why_it_matters_zh":"..."}` as text, strip markdown fences, `JSON.parse()`. This failed on Chinese content with unescaped quotes, fullwidth punctuation, and literal newlines inside strings — notably "Friendship Bracelet Loom Weaving" was producing repeated `[AutoTranslate] Failed for "Friendship Bracelet Loom Weaving": Unexpected token in JSON` errors in Railway.

Same Session 13 fix as teacher reports: replaced raw-JSON ask with `tool_use` structured output. Haiku now calls a `submit_translation` tool with three typed string fields (`name_zh`, `parent_description_zh`, `why_it_matters_zh`). The API handles JSON serialization internally — the model never produces raw JSON text, so escape-char corruption is impossible regardless of the language.

Pattern exactly matches canonical `lib/montree/reports/teacher-report-generator.ts` lines 530-660 — same `tool_choice: { type: 'tool' as const, name: '...' }`, same `response.content.find((block): block is { type: 'tool_use'; id: string; name: string; input: Record<string, unknown> } => block.type === 'tool_use' && block.name === '...')` type guard extraction.

DB write path preserved: both columns written (`name_zh` + `name_chinese`) per Session 14 dual-column rule. Glossary pre-check at top of `autoTranslateToChinese` still runs first (free, no API call). Batch route still processes in batches of 5 with 500ms inter-batch delay.

**Audit — CLEAN, no fixes needed:**
- All 5 callers of `autoTranslateToChinese` verified fire-and-forget safe (return value ignored, wrapped in `.catch()`):
  - `lib/montree/photo-identification/enrich-custom-work.ts:91` + `:188`
  - `app/api/montree/classroom-setup/route.ts:256`
  - `app/api/montree/principal/setup-stream/route.ts:333`
  - `app/api/montree/principal/setup/route.ts:144`
- `batch-translate/route.ts` has zero runtime callers — admin-only endpoint, only CLAUDE.md references.
- `npx tsc --noEmit` returned 4 errors, all pre-existing (verified via `git show 1c1938c3:` on both files — same `.update(updateData)` Supabase `never` type inference and `next/server` module resolution quirks that CLAUDE.md Session 21 already documents as acceptable).
- Commit diff via `git show 24eb850f -- <path>` on both files confirms clean swap: removed `response.content[0]?.type === 'text' ? response.content[0].text : ''` → `JSON.parse(jsonStr)` path, added `response.content.find(block => block.type === 'tool_use')` extraction. No collateral regressions.

**What to watch in Railway logs:**
- `[AutoTranslate] Failed for "Friendship Bracelet Loom Weaving"` — should stop.
- New rare failure mode: `[AutoTranslate] No tool_use block for "..."` — would indicate Haiku chose not to call the tool despite `tool_choice` forcing it. Expected to be near-zero with `tool_choice: { type: 'tool', name: 'submit_translation' }`.
- `[CorrectionsMap] Stale correction ignored` — should stop for the 11 cleaned rows. Legitimate future stale entries (from teacher Fix → work rename/delete) are acceptable signal.

**Next session priorities (in order):**
1. **Lucky / Primary Phonics Reader / Weekly Summary missing — USER-QUEUED audit.** User flagged via screenshot that Lucky did Primary Phonics today with other children but the work isn't appearing in today's Weekly Admin Docs Weekly Summary for Tredoux House. Trace the pipeline: Capture → Photo Audit confirm → `montree_media.work_id` + `teacher_confirmed=true` → Weekly Wrap generation window query → `/api/montree/weekly-admin-docs/auto-fill` area resolution → Word doc render. Candidate root causes to check in order: (a) is today's date within the current Mon-Sun window the Weekly Summary is reading? (b) is the Primary Phonics Reader photo `teacher_confirmed=true`? (c) does `auto-fill/route.ts` resolve the work's `area_id` to the canonical `language` key for Tredoux House's classroom? (d) was the Weekly Summary regenerated AFTER the photo was confirmed (stale cache is suspect #1 — user may need to tap "Auto-fill" again)?
2. **User: verify Master Campaign page on production** (Session 27 carryover) — navigate to `/montree/super-admin/marketing/master-campaign`, confirm stats load, try the download button.
3. **Phase 5 per-school enrichment** (Session 27 carryover) — 389 Apr 16 expansion rows, highest ROI is the ~195 rows with no email where a site scrape might yield a contact.
4. **Monitor Campaign D** on gmass.co/dashboard — should be done by now (~Apr 17).
5. **Verify Campaign A** ("Montree" pitch) draft still scheduled for 2026-04-27 09:00 +08:00 in Gmail Drafts.
6. **Session 25 carryover** — confirm China CDN hit rate climbs above 80% after 24-48h via Railway logs.
7. **Photo Audit `.like()` 50-item cap** (carryover) — pagination or pre-computed normalized name index.
8. **Intermittent `Could not resolve photo URL for media_id=...`** in visual learning — needs a dedicated repro session.

### ⚡ Session 27 — Master Campaign Super-Admin Page + Deliverability Audit + Dedup (Apr 16, 2026)

**One commit pushed to main: `b1345bc9`.** Integrated the MX-verified outreach master list into the Montree super-admin panel as a live, auth-gated dashboard. Net-new: 2 API routes + 1 page + 2 edits + 1 pre-baked JSON + a dedup pass that dropped Global from 786 → 785 and Deliverable_Global from 508 → 507.

**A. Deliverability audit (pre-session, Apr 16 Phases 1–4):**
- Global Outreach expanded to 786 schools (up from 420 pre-session via a WebClaude research sweep — batch tags `Expansion_MainClaude_Apr16` = 285 and `Expansion_WebClaude_Apr16` = 81)
- 4-phase verification pipeline: format validation → MX lookup (dnspython, 8.8.8.8/1.1.1.1/8.8.4.4, 4s timeout, 30-worker ThreadPoolExecutor) → HTTP HEAD→GET reachability (5s timeout, SSL-unverified) → audit column writeback with colour-coded PatternFills
- Three new columns on Global + China tabs: `Email_Status` (deliverable / dead_domain / no_mail_server / invalid_format / placeholder / dns_error), `Web_Status` (reachable / unverified — sandbox egress filtering made `dead` unreliable, so web is informational only), `Last_Verified`
- Colour fills: green=deliverable, red=dead_domain/no_mail_server/invalid_format, amber=dns_error/placeholder, grey=unverified
- Pre-filtered `Deliverable_Global` tab created — 507 rows of MX-verified, GMass-ready schools (post-dedup)

**B. Super-admin integration — 5 files:**

1. `app/api/montree/super-admin/master-outreach/summary/route.ts` (NEW, ~30 lines) — GET, `verifySuperAdminAuth()`, reads `public/data/master-outreach-summary.json`, returns parsed JSON with `Cache-Control: no-store`.
2. `app/api/montree/super-admin/master-outreach/download/route.ts` (NEW, ~35 lines) — GET, same auth gate, streams `Montree_Master_Outreach.xlsx` from `process.cwd()` with `Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="..._${date}.xlsx"`. Converts Node Buffer to ArrayBuffer slice for `NextResponse` body.
3. `app/montree/super-admin/marketing/master-campaign/page.tsx` (NEW, ~280 lines) — Login gate reusing `sa_pwd` sessionStorage pattern (same as `api-usage/page.tsx`). Emerald hero card with totals + big download button. 4-card deliverability grid (Deliverable 507 / Dead 77 / No mail server 3 / No email 195). 3 CampaignCards (D in_progress / A scheduled Apr 27 / C dead). Side-by-side batches + top-countries tables. China city pills. xlsx tab legend footer.
4. `app/montree/super-admin/marketing/page.tsx` (EDITED) — Added `Master Campaign` card as the FIRST featured tool in the INTELLIGENCE section.
5. `app/montree/super-admin/page.tsx` (EDITED) — Added a direct emerald `🎯 Master Campaign` button next to the Marketing Hub button on the super-admin root.

**C. Pre-baked summary JSON — architectural decision:**
`package.json` has no xlsx/exceljs/sheetjs — parsing xlsx at runtime in Next.js would require adding a dependency. Instead, the Python pipeline writes a pre-baked JSON to `public/data/master-outreach-summary.json` containing every stat the dashboard needs: totals, deliverability breakdown, batches, top countries, top China cities, campaign metadata. The summary route just reads and returns it. Ship-time cost = one JSON file (4.5KB). Runtime cost = one `readFile` per dashboard load. Zero npm deps added.

**D. Dedup pass — 1 real duplicate resolved:**
- `info@msb.edu.cn` appeared on Rows 20 and 23 of Global Outreach. Both the same institution — "MSB Beijing" (Row 20, richer record with Notes + AgeRange 2-12) and "International Montessori School of Beijing" (Row 23, the formal name, AgeRange 2-6 only). Merged the formal name into Row 20's Notes field, deleted Row 23.
- `info@montessoriacademy.cn` flagged as a dup in the prior session's handoff was stale — only one hit. No action needed.
- China tab scanned: zero email duplicates.
- Result: Global 786 → 785; Deliverable_Global 508 → 507; Combined 1,136 → 1,135. All three surfaces (summary JSON + Marketing Hub card description + Master Campaign page hero) updated to reflect new counts.

**E. Apr 16 Summary tab audit block appended** to document the dedup pass in the workbook itself (Rows 60–67). The audit trail lives with the data.

**Production verification:** `/montree/super-admin/marketing/master-campaign` on production returns 403 (correct — auth-gated). Full browser verification pending Railway deploy of `b1345bc9` (typically 2-3 min post-push). Page was audited locally: sheet counts, headers, colour fills, cross-check of deliverable count vs Deliverable_Global tab all match.

**🚨 Critical architectural notes for future sessions:**
- **Never parse xlsx at runtime in Next.js** — the project has no xlsx library. Pre-bake stats into `public/data/*.json` during the Python pipeline. The download route streams the raw xlsx binary; everything else reads the pre-baked JSON.
- **`sa_pwd` sessionStorage + `x-super-admin-password` header** is the canonical super-admin client auth pattern. Use `verifySuperAdminAuth()` on the server. See `app/montree/super-admin/api-usage/page.tsx` for the reference implementation.
- **Master Campaign is the single source of truth for outreach numbers** going forward. The `outreach-campaign` page and other marketing hub tools are legacy/unrelated. If you need to know the list state, check the Master Campaign page or the pre-baked JSON.
- **Column naming gotcha**: China tab cells with no email serialize as Python `None` via openpyxl rather than `''` (empty string). Visually identical in Excel, but strict equality checks and CSV exports will diverge. If you touch the China writeback pipeline, normalize empty cells to `''` on write.

**Pending work (scoped for future sessions, NOT this session's scope):**
- **Phase 5 — per-school enrichment**: WebFetch each of ~389 net-new rows (366 Apr 16 expansion + 23 Transparent Classroom users) to verify/refresh contact details from live school websites. Highest-ROI subset is the ~195 schools with no email on file where a site scrape might yield a new contact. Estimated time: ~3 hours at 30s/fetch. Batch as a dedicated task.
- **Production browser verification** of `/montree/super-admin/marketing/master-campaign` once Railway deploys. User action required — can't be automated (auth-gated).

**Next session priorities:**
1. **User: verify Master Campaign page renders correctly** — log into super-admin, navigate to `/montree/super-admin/marketing/master-campaign`, confirm stats load, try download button, verify the xlsx downloads cleanly.
2. **Phase 5 enrichment batch** — if desired, kick off the 389-row WebFetch enrichment on the Apr 16 expansion rows (see scope above).
3. **Monitor Campaign D** on gmass.co/dashboard — should be done now. Pull open/bounce rates.
4. **Verify Campaign A** ("Montree" pitch) draft still scheduled for 2026-04-27 09:00 +08:00 in Gmail Drafts.
5. **Session 25 carryover** — monitor China user load times via Railway logs, confirm CDN hit rate climbs above 80% after 24-48h post-deploy.

### ⚡ Session 26 — Bingo Phonics Tolerant Matching + Double-Header Cleanup (Apr 16, 2026)

**One commit pushed to main: `df47ad4f`.**

Two bugs, both surfaced while using the English Corner tracker on production.

**A. Bingo Phonics tab showed 20/20 in "NOT YET" despite real class activity.**
Root cause in `app/api/montree/dashboard/language-tracker/route.ts`: (1) client sends `?work_name=bingo-phonics-review` (URL-clean dashes) but the server ran the string verbatim through `.ilike('name', '%bingo-phonics-review%')`, which never matches the actual row "Bingo Phonics Review" (spaces). (2) the query was also restricted to `area_id = langArea.id`, so if the work lived under a custom area (Language-PhonicsFast, etc.) it was invisible.

Fix — tokenize on `[-_\s]+`, escape `%_\\`, glue with `%`:
```ts
if (workNameParam) {
  const tokens = workNameParam.split(/[-_\s]+/).filter(Boolean)
    .map(t => t.replace(/[%_\\]/g, '\\$&'));
  const pattern = `%${tokens.join('%')}%`;  // "%bingo%phonics%review%"
  query = query.ilike('name', pattern);
} else if (langArea) {
  query = query.eq('area_id', langArea.id);  // Overview tab — Language only
}
```
Also gated the "Language area not found" 404 on `!langArea && !workNameParam` so work_name searches still work in classrooms with no Language area seeded. Matches "Bingo Phonics Review", "Bingo (Phonics) Review", "Bingo-Phonics Review" — whatever the teacher typed when they first added the work via Photo Audit.

**B. Double DashboardHeader on 3 subpages.**
`app/montree/dashboard/layout.tsx:37` already renders `<DashboardHeader />` globally for every route under `/montree/dashboard/*`. Three pages were also importing and rendering their own, producing a visible double header stack. Fixed by removing the import + JSX from:
- `app/montree/dashboard/language-tracker/page.tsx`
- `app/montree/dashboard/focus/page.tsx`
- `app/montree/dashboard/language-semester/page.tsx`

Added `pt-20` to each page's inner container (compensates for the fixed-position header from the layout). Post-fix grep: only `layout.tsx` renders DashboardHeader (two other matches are comments). Audit-fix cycle ran 2 clean passes.

**Key architectural pattern — never render DashboardHeader in a dashboard subpage.** The layout at `app/montree/dashboard/layout.tsx` owns it for the entire subtree. If a new dashboard subpage needs a sub-header (curriculum/child pages already do this correctly), it should be a sub-header component styled below the global one, not another `<DashboardHeader />`.

**Production verification (Apr 16, post-deploy):**
- ✅ Confirmed "Bingo Phonics Review" exists as a curriculum row: `fb96b2a6-de3e-4d07-9972-56e3fba5c5c3`, under the standard **Language** area (`area_key='language'`, area id `b6ccda99-e1ef-47f5-aab6-5e8bc041082e`). Primary bug was just the dash-vs-space `ilike` mismatch — the tolerant tokenizer alone fixed it. The cross-area search was defense-in-depth and didn't need to kick in for this work, but remains correct behavior for any future custom-area works.
- ✅ English Corner → Bingo Phonics tab on production: **11 Visited / 9 Not Yet**. Amy and Eric showing 1 session Tue with day badges.
- ✅ Single header on English Corner, Focus List, and Language Semester Report pages.

**Next session priorities:**
1. **Session 25 carryover** — monitor China user load times via Railway logs, confirm CDN hit rate climbs above 80% after 24-48h post-deploy.
2. **Monitor Campaign D** on gmass.co/dashboard — should be done by now.
3. **Verify Campaign A** ("Montree" pitch) draft still scheduled for Apr 27.

## RECENT STATUS (Apr 15, 2026)

### ⚡ Session 25 — Perf Cycle: Gallery Fetch Elimination + srcset/CDN Proxy Sweep (Apr 15, 2026)

**Six files changed, committed+pushed in prior turns, 3-round clean audit this turn.** Zero UI changes — pure speed work targeting China users on Cloudflare edge.

**The headline win — MediaCard.tsx per-card fetch eliminated:**
`components/montree/media/MediaCard.tsx` was doing `useEffect` + `fetch('/api/montree/media/url?path=...')` for EVERY card. On a 30-photo gallery that's 30 HTTP roundtrips just to get URLs. But `/api/montree/media/url` only returns `getProxyUrl(path)` — a deterministic string computable inline. Ripped out the fetch + loading state + spinner branch entirely. Card now computes `imageUrl` synchronously from `media.thumbnail_path || media.storage_path` via `getThumbnailUrl(path, 400)`. First paint is instant, zero network dependency.

**srcset + content-visibility sweep:**
- `MediaCard.tsx` + `app/montree/parent/photos/page.tsx` — grid images now ship `srcSet={getThumbnailSrcSet(path, 400)}` (1x/2x/3x DPR variants via Supabase render `?w=` transforms) with `sizes="(max-width: 640px) 50vw, 400px"`. Retina crisp, low-DPR saves bytes.
- Both grid wrappers: `style={{ contentVisibility: 'auto', containIntrinsicSize: '1px 200px' }}`. Native CSS — browser skips layout+paint for off-screen cards. No-op on old browsers.
- `loading="lazy"` + `decoding="async"` on all img tags.

**Three upload routes now write Cloudflare-proxy URLs straight to DB:**
- `app/api/montree/media/upload/route.ts` (line 218) — main photo uploads
- `app/api/montree/media/crop/route.ts` (line 100) — cropped versions (returns `cropped_url` in response, callers use this)
- `app/api/montree/raz/upload/route.ts` (line 95) — RAZ reading photos (RAZ persists URL to DB, so all new rows go forward as proxy URLs)

Legacy rows with publicUrl still work — same Cloudflare edge serves both. No migration needed.

**Deliberately NOT touched (each has a reason):**
- `photo-bank/route.ts` — uses `photo-bank` bucket, proxy route only handles `montree-media`
- `feedback/upload-screenshot/route.ts` — uses `feedback-screenshots` bucket
- Server-to-server Anthropic vision routes (`debug-insight`, `photo-identification/process`, `photo-audit/tell-ai`, `classroom-setup/describe`, `guru/photo-enrich`, `guru/photo-insight`, `guru/photo-insight/add-custom-work`, `guru/snap-identify`) — keep `getPublicUrl`, proxy would be wasteful overhead on server→server calls
- Parent/photos lightbox `/api/montree/media/url` fetch — per-click on open, not per-card, fine to leave
- Report APIs that pre-resolve URLs without storage_path — adding srcset needs coordinated API+client refactor (high risk, skipped)

**3-round audit results — two consecutive clean passes:**

| File | Status |
|---|---|
| `app/api/montree/audit/photos/route.ts` | Clean — null-safe proxy fallback lines 247-249 |
| `app/api/montree/media/upload/route.ts` | Clean — `getProxyUrl` import line 8, used line 218, no stale refs |
| `app/api/montree/media/crop/route.ts` | Clean — import line 7, used line 100, `cropped_url` in response |
| `app/api/montree/raz/upload/route.ts` | Clean — import line 8, used line 95 |
| `components/montree/media/MediaCard.tsx` | Clean — deterministic proxy URL, srcset, content-visibility, no dead fetch state |
| `app/montree/parent/photos/page.tsx` | Clean — srcset + lazy + content-visibility on grid |

**Key architectural pattern for future sessions — proxy URL determinism:**
`getProxyUrl(storage_path)` is a pure function returning a Cloudflare-cached URL for the `montree-media` public bucket. No auth, no DB lookup, no async. Anywhere the client needs to display an image whose `storage_path` is already loaded in state, compute the URL inline — do NOT fetch `/api/montree/media/url`. That endpoint exists only for cases where the client has a `media_id` but not the `storage_path` (e.g., lightbox opened from a share link).

**Git push pattern (carryover — critical):**
Sandbox `rm -f` can't clear `.git/*.lock` files due to permission issues. Always use Desktop Commander on the user's Mac:
```
cd ~/Desktop/Master\ Brain/ACTIVE/whale && rm -f .git/HEAD.lock .git/index.lock && git add <files> && git commit -m "..." && git push origin main 2>&1
```
timeout_ms: 30000. Chain everything in one invocation — the lock files reappear between commands in Railway-deploy-heavy sessions.

**Next session priorities:**
1. **Monitor China user load times** via Railway logs — look for CDN hit rates on the proxy route. If edge cache hits climb above 80% after 24-48h, this cycle is paying off.
2. **Test Language Semester Report Generator on production** (Session 24 carryover) — ··· menu → 📄 Language Semester Report. Try 1 kid first, then a 3-5 kid bundle. Verify filename sanitization + zip structure + Sonnet-only content (no Amy leftovers).
3. **Consider eliminating `/api/montree/media/url` route entirely** — if grep shows only the parent/photos lightbox calls it, inline that one site too and delete the endpoint.
4. **Consider `photo-bank` bucket proxy** — extend proxy route to handle multiple buckets via query param, unify CDN caching story. Medium-risk refactor, defer until there's a user complaint.
5. **Monitor Campaign D** on gmass.co/dashboard — should be done by now (~Apr 17). Check open rates, bounces.
6. **Verify Campaign A** ("Montree" pitch) draft still scheduled for Apr 27 in Gmail Drafts.

### ⚡ Session 24 — Language Semester Report Generator (Apr 15, 2026)

**Two commits pushed to main: `c569b61d`, `810cdc00`.**

**THE TASK:** User uploaded `Amy.pptx` — a finished Language semester progress report template (Pre-Kindergarten, purple clouds, 4-work status table, 3-paragraph parent letter in warm teacher voice). Asked for a one-click system to generate the same report for every child in Whale Class, free-tier only. "a text only - yes build now."

**What shipped (end-to-end pipeline):**

1. **Pre-tokenized template** (`public/templates/language-semester-report.pptx`, 26.4MB)
   - Amy's original `.pptx` → zip of XML → collapsed target paragraphs to single-run tokens to avoid PowerPoint's run-splitting during runtime string replace
   - 11 unique tokens, each appearing exactly once in `ppt/slides/slide1.xml`:
     - Works table: `{{WORK_1_NAME}}..{{WORK_4_NAME}}`, `{{WORK_1_STATUS}}..{{WORK_4_STATUS}}`
     - Narrative: `{{PARA_OPENING}}`, `{{PARA_CIRCLE}}`, `{{PARA_ENGLISH}}`

2. **API route** — `app/api/montree/reports/language-semester/generate/route.ts` (NEW, ~290 lines)
   - `POST` endpoint, `maxDuration=300`, max 30 children per request
   - Auth: `verifySchoolRequest()` + per-child `verifyChildBelongsToSchool()` (returns `{allowed, classroomId}`)
   - Loads Language progress: resolves Language `area_id` from `montree_classroom_curriculum_areas` → queries `montree_child_work_progress` → dedupes by `work_name` keeping highest status rank `{presented:1, practicing:2, mastered:3}`
   - Calls **Sonnet** with `tool_use` structured output (`REPORT_TOOL` schema: `para_opening`/`para_circle`/`para_english` strings + `works` array 1-4 items with `name` + `status` enum `['P','Pr','MD']`)
   - System prompt: "warm, specific, Montessori-literate… plain paragraph prose only" — same voice as Amy's original
   - `fillTemplate()` — `jszip` loads template → regex-replaces each token in slide1.xml → XML-escapes narrative content (`& < > " '`) → re-zips with DEFLATE level 6
   - Single child → returns `.pptx` directly with `Content-Disposition` attachment filename
   - Multi-child → bundles into zip; includes `_errors.txt` on partial failure; `X-Report-Errors` header surfaces error count
   - Filename sanitization: `name.replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9_-]/g, '_')` + dedup via `usedNames` Set

3. **UI page** — `app/montree/dashboard/language-semester/page.tsx` (NEW, ~230 lines)
   - Lists all children in classroom with checkboxes + Select All toggle
   - POST with `child_ids[]`, reads response as blob, parses `Content-Disposition` for filename, creates anchor download
   - Progress state, error state, bilingual (EN/ZH)

4. **Menu link** — `components/montree/DashboardHeader.tsx` — ··· menu → 📄 Language Semester Report. Not feature-gated (visible to all schools).

**THE AUDIT CATCH (crown jewel of this session, fixed in `810cdc00`):**
After shipping `c569b61d`, ran a test fill with tricky characters and rendered via `mnt/.claude/skills/pptx/scripts/thumbnail.py`. Thumbnail showed Amy's **original** hardcoded paragraph ("Dear Amy, you have grown so much this semester…") sitting BETWEEN `{{PARA_OPENING}}` and `{{PARA_CIRCLE}}`. The tokenize step had collapsed some paragraphs to tokens but left paragraph P13 (offsets 22429-22901 in slide1.xml) behind — a literal duplicate. Every generated report would have rendered Sonnet's new opening followed immediately by Amy's original text. Surgical fix: regex-matched the stray `<a:p>` node containing "you have grown so much" and removed it from the template zip. Verified via second thumbnail — clean.

**Diagnostic technique for future pptx template work:**
- "Dear Amy" wasn't findable via `xml.indexOf()` because it's split across multiple `<a:r>` runs (run-level formatting splits on every style change)
- "you have grown so much" WAS findable because it was a contiguous text run
- Paragraph-level inspection (parse all `<a:p>...</a:p>` blocks, extract `<a:t>` text nodes, join, inspect) is the reliable audit — individual `indexOf()` on partial phrases misses split text
- Always render a test fill via `thumbnail.py` BEFORE shipping any pptx template. Visual verification catches what text diffing can't.

**Key technical patterns:**
- **Token collapse before replace**: PowerPoint splits `<a:r>` runs on every formatting change. If you insert a placeholder like `{{FOO}}` into text with existing styling, runtime string replace may fail because the token gets split across runs. Fix: pre-tokenize by collapsing the target paragraph to a single `<a:r>` run containing just the token. Done at template-prep time, not runtime.
- **XML escape before insert**: Sonnet output can contain `& < > " '` which would corrupt the XML. `xmlEscape()` wraps every narrative string.
- **tool_use over raw JSON**: Same pattern as Session 13+. Sonnet via `tool_use` never produces raw JSON text, so no escape-char corruption even in Chinese. Structured schema enforces field types.
- **`verifyChildBelongsToSchool` returns object, not boolean**: `{allowed: boolean, classroomId?: string}`. Wrong early: `if (!await verify...)`. Correct: `const access = await verify...; if (!access.allowed)`.

**Minor notes (not blocking, worth knowing):**
1. **Memory**: 20 children × 26MB = ~520MB peak during zip generation. Railway `start.sh` sets `--max-old-space-size=2048` (2GB heap). Class of 30 would be ~780MB — fine. Concurrent requests could OOM — consider streaming zip if class sizes grow or if multiple teachers use simultaneously.
2. **Template re-read per request**: `readFile(templatePath)` runs every POST. Could cache in module scope (~26MB permanent RAM, acceptable).
3. **Serial Sonnet calls**: 20 kids × ~20s = ~6-7min per class run. Safe for rate limits. Could parallelize with `p-limit` concurrency 3.
4. **No rate limiter** on endpoint. 30-child cap + 300s `maxDuration` contain blast radius.
5. **Language-area-only**: pipeline only pulls `area_key='language'` progress. Opening/Circle narrative drafted from Language data alone — if teacher wants Math/Sensorial narrative later, needs schema expansion.

**Files changed this session (4 files, ~530 new lines):**
- `public/templates/language-semester-report.pptx` — NEW tokenized template
- `app/api/montree/reports/language-semester/generate/route.ts` — NEW generation endpoint
- `app/montree/dashboard/language-semester/page.tsx` — NEW selector page
- `components/montree/DashboardHeader.tsx` — ··· menu link added

**Next session priorities:**
1. **User test on production** — hard-refresh after Railway deploy of `810cdc00`. ··· menu → 📄 Language Semester Report. Try on 1 kid first (downloads .pptx directly). Open in PowerPoint/Keynote, verify: (a) only Sonnet-authored paragraphs render, no Amy leftover text, (b) works table shows that child's real works with correct MD/Pr/P status, (c) layout/fonts/clouds unchanged from Amy's original.
2. **Test multi-child bundle** — select 3-5 kids, generate, verify zip downloads with one .pptx per child, filenames sanitized.
3. **Watch Railway memory** if class-wide run is attempted (all 20 kids at once). If OOM, ship the streaming-zip optimization.
4. **Consider cache**: if this endpoint gets heavy use, move `readFile(templatePath)` to module scope.
5. **Future**: if reports for other areas are requested (Math, Sensorial, Cultural), clone the template+tokenize pipeline per area. The API route generalizes cleanly — just need the area key parametrized and per-area Sonnet prompts.

## RECENT STATUS (Apr 14, 2026)

### ⚡ Session 23 — Review-Before-Process Containment Audit (7 rounds) + Child Profile Pending Panel (Apr 14, 2026)

**Two commits pushed to main: `51878418`, `4c15b7f9`.**

**THE TASK:** User requested "audit-fix cycle until two consecutive clean audits". Round 5+ of an audit cycle for the `review_before_process` workflow (feature flag, migration 177) — the workflow where photos land with `identification_status='pending_review'` and AI only fires after teacher batch-approval. Goal: ensure pending_review photos NEVER leak to parents and NEVER inflate teacher aggregations that drive reports/recommendations. (Rounds 1–4 were prior sessions, commits up to `0c2b9bda` — 3-layer defense, feature flag, migration 177, PendingReviewPanel UI, batch process/delete routes.)

**Round 5 — 12 leak vectors fixed across 11 files (commit `51878418`):**

All filters use the canonical NULL-safe pattern (PostgREST's `.neq` excludes NULL rows, so `.or()` with `.is.null` is required):
```ts
.or('identification_status.is.null,identification_status.neq.pending_review')
```

Files patched:
1. `components/montree/photo-audit/PendingReviewPanel.tsx` — extended `date_from` window from 30 days → 365 days (was silently hiding pending_review photos older than 30 days)
2. `app/api/montree/parent/dashboard/route.ts` (line 184) — recent photos query, parent-facing leak
3. `app/api/montree/parent/report/[reportId]/route.ts` (3 queries: lines 249, 330, 349) — saved-content fallback + junction-selected photos + weekly photos fallback
4. `app/api/montree/reports/send/route.ts` (lines 126, 153) — defensive filters on report dispatch (parents receive emails)
5. `app/api/montree/albums/route.ts` (lines 52, 79) — direct + group queries (teacher curates albums but parents receive prints)
6. `app/api/montree/weekly-review/[childId]/route.ts` (line 352) — per-child weekly review aggregation
7. `app/api/montree/children/[childId]/route.ts` (line 60) — child detail GET (PendingReviewPanel owns pending photos, main view shows confirmed only)
8. `app/api/montree/children/[childId]/activity-summary/route.ts` (lines 131, 153) — Haiku weekly summary on child week view
9. `app/api/montree/dashboard/daily-language-6/route.ts` (lines 88, 110) — Daily Language 6 widget
10. `app/api/montree/dashboard/language-tracker/route.ts` (lines 105, 127) — English Corner tracker
11. `app/api/montree/weekly-admin-docs/auto-fill/route.ts` (line 164) — Weekly Admin auto-fill aggregation

**Round 6 + Round 7 — TWO CLEAN PASSES (no new leak vectors found):**

All 51 files using `from('montree_media')` were classified by leak risk:
- **Filtered (parent/teacher-aggregation)**: all 6 parent-facing routes verified, all 7 reports/* routes verified, audit/photos has explicit `pending_review` zone handling
- **Intentionally unfiltered (must NOT filter)**:
  - AI-processing routes: `guru/photo-insight/*`, `guru/snap-identify`, `guru/photo-enrich`, `photo-audit/resolve`, `photo-audit/tell-ai`, `photo-identification/process`, `photo-identification/sweep`, `photo-identification/batch`, `enrich-custom-work` — these MUST see pending_review photos to process them
  - Attendance/event signals: `intelligence/daily-brief`, `events/attendance`, `events/route` — semantically "captured today" includes pending_review
  - Single-row reads/writes by ID: `media/crop`, `media/route.ts` (writes), `media/upload`, `media/batch-retag`, `media/children` — not aggregation, not leak vectors
  - Admin diagnostics: `admin/activity`, `super-admin/schools`, `curriculum/duplicates`, `lib/montree/super-admin/guru-executor.ts`
  - Teacher AI tools: `lib/montree/guru/tool-executor.ts`, `lib/montree/admin/guru-executor.ts`, `app/api/montree/children/[childId]/guru/route.ts` — pending_review photos have NULL `work_id` so they naturally don't bucket into work-name aggregations
- **Dead code**: `lib/montree/photos.ts:getChildPhotos` is defined but never called

**Defense-layer verification (audited but not modified):**
- `app/api/montree/media/upload/route.ts` lines 132-140 — correctly checks `isFeatureEnabled(supabase, schoolId, 'review_before_process')` and sets `identification_status: 'pending_review'` when enabled AND no `work_id` (skipped when teacher manually tagged a work)
- `lib/montree/offline/sync-manager.ts` lines 425-447 — correctly skips fire-and-forget AI dispatch when `result.ai_deferred === true`

**Child week view pending panel (commit `4c15b7f9`):**

User feedback: "I still want to be able to see each child's pictures from their profile." The PendingReviewPanel was previously only visible on:
- Classroom-wide Photo Audit page (`/montree/dashboard/photo-audit` — Pending Review zone tab)
- Per-child gallery sub-page (`/montree/dashboard/[childId]/gallery`)

NOT visible on the main child week view (`/montree/dashboard/[childId]` — the page with Game Plan + shelf). User wanted it on the child's main profile page.

**Fix:** Added `<PendingReviewPanel childId={childId} compact onProcessed={() => fetchAssignments()} />` to `app/montree/dashboard/[childId]/page.tsx` (line 669), placed at the top just before the Tell Guru onboarding card. Feature-gated on `review_before_process`, hidden for homeschool parents. The `onProcessed` callback re-runs `fetchAssignments()` so newly-confirmed photos surface in the shelf below without page reload.

The `compact` mode renders nothing when the queue is empty (no UI clutter on the child week view when there's nothing to review).

**The complete review-before-process workflow (now with three entry points):**
1. Teacher captures photos freely on Capture page → land as `pending_review`, no AI fires
2. Pending photos visible in 3 places:
   - Top of any child's week view (NEW — Session 23, commit `4c15b7f9`)
   - Top of any child's gallery sub-page (Session 22 prior)
   - Pending Review tab on the classroom-wide Photo Audit page (Session 22 prior)
3. Teacher selects keepers → "Process Selected" runs Haiku/Sonnet only on those
4. Teacher selects junk/duplicates → "Delete Selected" (no API cost)
5. Confirmed photos flow into normal pipeline (haiku_matched, sonnet_drafted, etc.)

**Architectural decisions confirmed by audit:**
- Three-layer defense (upload route → sync-manager → process route safety bail) is intact and working
- The `pending_review` status is the **only** signal needed for this workflow — no separate `teacher_confirmed` flag (different from Session 7's correction workflow which uses `teacher_confirmed`)
- Junction-table queries via `montree_media_children` only ever route through filtered SELECTs in the parent/report/album surfaces, so the inner JOIN against `montree_media` inherits the filter

**Key files changed this session (12 files, ~45 lines):**
- 11 API routes filtered (Round 5)
- `components/montree/photo-audit/PendingReviewPanel.tsx` — date window 30d→365d
- `app/montree/dashboard/[childId]/page.tsx` — PendingReviewPanel import + render

**Next session priorities:**
1. **User test pending panel on Molly's profile** — hard-refresh `/montree/dashboard/{molly-id}` after Railway deploy. Capture a photo for Molly. Verify amber pending panel appears at top of her week view. Tap Process Selected → verify photo flows into the shelf below.
2. **Verify pending panel doesn't appear when empty** — confirm `compact` mode renders nothing on children with no pending photos (no UI clutter).
3. **Test the parent leak fixes** — log in as a parent for a Whale Class child, hit `/montree/parent/dashboard` and `/montree/parent/report/[id]`, verify only confirmed photos appear (no pending_review photos visible).
4. **Monitor Campaign D** on gmass.co/dashboard — should be done by ~Apr 17. Check open rates, bounces.
5. **Verify Campaign A** ("Montree" pitch) draft still scheduled for Apr 27 in Gmail Drafts.
6. **Photo audit: Jimmy's work** — user identified flat colored discs (red, yellow, blue) graded by size on a mat. Likely Knobless Cylinders viewed from above, but user wasn't sure. Needs in-person verification before fixing the photo audit card.

## RECENT STATUS (Apr 13, 2026)

### ⚡ Session 22 — Child Guru Production Fixes + English Corner Language Tracker (Apr 13, 2026)

**Three commits pushed to main: `6846749a`, `73ad1488`.**

**THE SESSION:** Fixed three production-breaking bugs in the Child Guru from Session 21, then built the English Corner — a real-time Language area tracker showing which children have visited English this week and who still needs to come.

**A. Child Guru Production Fixes — `6846749a`:**

Three bugs that were crashing in Railway logs:

1. **`NextResponse is not defined`** — GET handler for chat history used `NextResponse.json()` but only `NextRequest` was imported. Added `NextResponse` to the import.

2. **`ERR_SSL_WRONG_VERSION_NUMBER` on game plan refresh** — The `refresh_game_plan` tool used `fetch()` to call a sibling API route internally. Railway's internal loopback via HTTPS causes SSL errors (same issue as Session 10 photo-audit resolve route). **Fix:** Replaced the internal fetch with a full in-process implementation (`refreshGamePlanInProcess()`) that directly queries Supabase, builds the Haiku prompt, calls the API, and saves via `updateChildSettings()`. No HTTP involved — runs entirely in-process.

3. **Chinese locale not reaching game plan refresh** — The `locale` parameter was being read from the POST body and passed to `buildSystemPrompt()` correctly, but the old internal fetch for game plan refresh constructed a URL query param that wasn't being forwarded properly through Railway's SSL layer. The in-process refactor fixes this — `locale` passes directly as a function argument and controls whether Haiku generates the nudge/direction in Chinese.

**Key architectural pattern — In-process route calls on Railway:**
Railway internal loopback via HTTPS fails with SSL errors. When one API route needs to call another, DON'T use `fetch()` — instead, extract the core logic into a shared function and call it directly. This is the same pattern used in Session 10 for photo-audit resolve (`correctionsPost(synthetic)` replaced internal fetch to corrections route). The `refreshGamePlanInProcess()` function (~110 lines) does everything the `/api/montree/children/[childId]/game-plan/refresh` route does: fetches child data + profile + progress + notes, builds a progress summary, calls Haiku with `tool_use` structured output, and saves via `updateChildSettings()`.

**Key file**: `app/api/montree/children/[childId]/guru/route.ts` — Added `NextResponse` import (line 7), `updateChildSettings` import (line 15), `refreshGamePlanInProcess()` function (lines 63-173), replaced internal fetch call (line 320).

**B. English Corner — Language Area Tracker — `73ad1488`:**

New feature-gated page showing which children have done Language area work this week and who hasn't. Real-time from tagged photos.

**The page (`/montree/dashboard/language-tracker`):**
- Progress bar: X/20 visited this week
- **"Not Yet" section first** (red dot) — children with NO Language photos this week. Displayed as a 2-3 column grid of tappable child pills. Teacher sees immediately who to call over.
- **"Visited" section below** (green checkmark) — each child with their specific Language works shown as emerald pills with day badges (Mon, Tue, Wed, etc.). Shows work count per child.
- Every child card tappable → navigates to their child page
- Bilingual: all labels in EN/ZH via `locale`
- Refresh button at bottom
- 🎉 celebration state when everyone has visited

**The API (`GET /api/montree/dashboard/language-tracker`):**
- Resolves `language` area ID for classroom via `montree_classroom_curriculum_areas`
- Gets all language work IDs from `montree_classroom_curriculum_works`
- Queries `montree_media` for photos this week (Mon-Sun) with language work_id
- Also checks group photos via `montree_media_children` junction table
- Deduplicates works per child (keeps most recent)
- Returns `{ visited[], notYet[], weekStart, weekEnd, totalChildren, visitedCount }`
- Auth: `verifySchoolRequest()`, no-store cache

**Menu integration:**
- 🇬🇧 English Corner link added to DashboardHeader ··· dropdown menu
- Feature-gated: `isEnabled('english_corner')`
- Positioned after RAZ Reading Tracker, before Paperwork Tracker

**Feature enablement:**
- Migration 175: enables `english_corner` for Whale Class
- Feature definition already existed (migration 149) — just needed the school-level enable
- User ran the enable SQL manually in Supabase SQL Editor

**Key files (3 new, 1 modified):**
- `app/api/montree/dashboard/language-tracker/route.ts` — NEW: Language tracker API (~190 lines)
- `app/montree/dashboard/language-tracker/page.tsx` — NEW: English Corner page (~240 lines)
- `migrations/175_enable_english_corner_whale_class.sql` — NEW: Enable for Whale Class
- `components/montree/DashboardHeader.tsx` — Added 🇬🇧 English Corner link to ··· menu

**DailyLanguageSix removed from capture page? NO — left in place.** The Daily Language 6 widget on the capture page (Session 20) is a different feature with a different purpose (nudge during photo tagging). English Corner is the review facility. They coexist. User said "leave it out of the capture function" referring to the tracker, not asking to remove the existing widget. If user later wants Daily Language 6 removed from capture, that's a separate task.

**Commits this session (full list including carryover from Session 21 continuation):**
- `cd27a059` — Child Guru: API + UI + wiring (Session 21)
- `a804093d` — CLAUDE.md update
- `cdd772fd` — Strip markdown from Guru responses
- `76f2202a` — Auto-refresh page after tool actions
- `5c5c44a4` — Persist chat history + auto P/P/M from photo count
- `4c11b970` — Game Plan label
- `1e6f7556` — Chinese locale for Guru
- `9508d280` — Fix DB columns (response → response_insight)
- `6d5908ad` — Game plan refresh tool + Chinese locale + bolder label
- `6846749a` — **Fix: NextResponse import, in-process game plan refresh, Chinese locale**
- `73ad1488` — **English Corner: Language area tracker**

**Auto P/P/M from photo count (built in Session 21 continuation, commit `5c5c44a4`):**
- First photo of a work → status set to `presented` (+ `presented_at` timestamp)
- Second photo of same work → status upgraded to `practicing`
- `mastered` is teacher-only manual — never set automatically
- Upgrade-only: never downgrades status
- Lives in `app/api/montree/guru/photo-insight/route.ts` (~lines 2031-2090)

**Next session priorities:**
1. **Test Child Guru on production** — tap the green chat bubble on any child's page. Test: "what should I do next with Molly?", "fill her shelf with sensorial works", "update the game plan". Verify actions execute (shelf updates, observations saved, game plan refreshes).
2. **Test game plan refresh in Chinese** — switch to Chinese locale, ask Guru "更新游戏计划" or "refresh the game plan". Verify nudge and direction come back in Chinese.
3. **Test English Corner on production** — ··· menu → 🇬🇧 English Corner. Verify children with Language photos this week show in "Visited" with work pills. Verify children without show in "Not Yet".
4. **Monitor Campaign D** on gmass.co/dashboard — should be done by now (~Apr 17 target)
5. **Verify Campaign A** ("Montree" pitch) draft still scheduled for Apr 27
6. **Run migration 175** on production if not already done (user ran the SQL manually this session)
7. **Photo audit: Jimmy's work** — user identified flat colored discs (red, yellow, blue) graded by size on a mat. Likely Knobless Cylinders viewed from above, but user wasn't sure. Needs in-person verification before fixing the photo audit card.
8. **Consider removing DailyLanguageSix from capture page** — user said "its no good there" and "confusing." The English Corner tracker replaces its purpose. May want to disable `daily_language_6` feature flag or remove the component from capture page entirely.

### ⚡ Session 21 — Unified Game Plan + Shelf Card, Haiku Switch, Fill Shelf Auto-Populate + Child Guru (Apr 13, 2026)

**Six commits pushed to main: `788d2791`, `26e49437`, `97b9d1ef`, `4a949e74`, `2bd449ac`, `cd27a059`.**

**THE SESSION:** Merged the standalone Game Plan card and "This Week's Focus" shelf into a single unified card. Rewrote game plan generation from Sonnet to Haiku with a radically simplified output. Added one-click shelf auto-populate from game plan works. Built the Child Guru — lightweight AI chat embedded on each child's page.

**A. Merge Game Plan + This Week's Focus — `788d2791`:**
- GamePlanCard was a standalone expandable card showing phases, strategies, weekly check questions
- FocusWorksSection was the 5-area shelf below it
- User said "it's two systems doing the same function" — merged them into one card
- FocusWorksSection now receives `gamePlan`, `onRefreshGamePlan`, `onShelfFilled` props
- When a game plan exists: amber gradient background, 🧭 nudge sentence at top, work chips, direction arrow, then the 5 shelf areas below. Footer shows "Updated today" + Refresh link.
- When no game plan: plain white card with just the shelf (unchanged behavior)
- Standalone `<GamePlanCard>` removed from child page render (component file kept for type export `GamePlan`)
- `WeeklyActivitySummary` hidden when gamePlan exists (game plan replaces it): `{!gamePlan && isEnabled('weekly_activity_summary') && ...}`
- **Key files**: `components/montree/child/FocusWorksSection.tsx`, `app/montree/dashboard/[childId]/page.tsx`

**B. Fix: clamp activePhase on plan change — `26e49437`:**
- When game plan refreshes with fewer phases or navigating between children, `activePhase` state could index beyond the phases array
- Fixed with `const clampedPhase = phaseCount > 0 ? Math.min(activePhase, phaseCount - 1) : 0;` and deferred state sync
- Also guarded `(activePhaseData.works || []).map()` for malformed phases missing works array

**C. Haiku Game Plan — Radically Simplified — `97b9d1ef`:**
- User feedback on Sonnet output: "this was written by sonnet and is way too complicated... teachers wont read this. They already know the details they just want a prompt for a tired brain."
- **Model switch**: `AI_MODEL` (Sonnet) → `HAIKU_MODEL` in both `onboard/route.ts` and `game-plan/refresh/route.ts`
- **Schema reduction**: Old Sonnet schema had headline, priority_areas, parent_goals, phases (each with title/goal/works/strategies), weekly_check_questions, language_note. New Haiku schema has 3 fields:
  - `nudge` (string, max 25 words) — "One warm sentence a tired teacher reads in 2 seconds"
  - `works` (string[], 3-5) — specific Montessori works to present next, EXACT names from curriculum
  - `direction` (string) — area progression in arrow format, e.g. "Practical Life → Sensorial → Language"
- **max_tokens**: 3000 → 500
- **Cost**: ~$0.001/plan (Haiku) vs ~$0.03/plan (Sonnet) — 30x cheaper
- **Backward compat**: GamePlan interface keeps both old and new fields. FocusWorksSection has fallback chain: `planNudge = gamePlan?.nudge || gamePlan?.headline || ''`, `planWorks = gamePlan?.works || gamePlan?.phases?.[0]?.works || []`, `planDirection = gamePlan?.direction || gamePlan?.priority_areas?.join(' → ') || ''`
- Existing Sonnet-generated plans still render correctly through fallbacks
- **Key files**: `app/api/montree/children/[childId]/onboard/route.ts` (lines 411-516), `app/api/montree/children/[childId]/game-plan/refresh/route.ts`, `components/montree/child/GamePlanCard.tsx` (interface only)

**D. Fill Shelf Button — Auto-Populate from Game Plan — `4a949e74`:**
- Amber "Fill shelf ↓" button appears inline next to work chips when game plan has works AND empty area slots exist on the shelf
- One tap: POST to `/api/montree/children/[childId]/fill-shelf` with `{ works: planWorks }`
- API resolves work names to areas via case-insensitive lookup against `montree_classroom_curriculum_works`
- Only fills empty area slots — never overwrites existing focus works
- Upserts to both `montree_child_focus_works` (set_by: 'game_plan') and `montree_child_work_progress` (status: 'presented')
- On success: shows "✓ Done" badge, calls `onShelfFilled` → parent page refreshes focus works via `fetchAssignments()`
- Bilingual: "Fill shelf" / "填充书架", "Done" / "已填充"
- **Key files**: `app/api/montree/children/[childId]/fill-shelf/route.ts` (NEW, 128 lines), `components/montree/child/FocusWorksSection.tsx`

**E. Fix: shelfFilled state reset on child change — `2bd449ac`:**
- **Bug found in audit**: `shelfFilled` local state in FocusWorksSection persisted when navigating between children. After filling shelf for child A, child B would show "Done" instead of "Fill shelf" button.
- **Fix**: `useEffect(() => { setShelfFilled(false); }, [childId, gamePlan]);`
- **Key file**: `components/montree/child/FocusWorksSection.tsx`

**Audit results (end of session):**
- ✅ FocusWorksSection backward compat fallback chains correct
- ✅ fill-shelf API: auth verified, `.maybeSingle()`, case-insensitive lookup, dedup via `filledAreas` set, upserts both tables
- ✅ Haiku game plan: both onboard and refresh routes use `HAIKU_MODEL`, tight 3-field tool schema
- ✅ GamePlan interface supports both Haiku compact and Sonnet legacy formats
- ✅ TypeScript: no new errors from session files (pre-existing `next/server` module resolution and Supabase `never` type inference unchanged)
- ✅ shelfFilled stale state bug found and fixed

**Key architectural decisions:**
- **Haiku over Sonnet for game plans**: Sonnet writes essays. Teachers don't read essays. Haiku with a tight `tool_use` schema produces exactly the 2-second-read output teachers need. 30x cheaper too.
- **Unified card over two separate components**: Game plan and shelf were conceptually the same thing — "what should I do with this child this week?" Merging removes visual clutter and cognitive overhead.
- **Fill shelf as one-click**: Resolving work names to areas is non-trivial (case-insensitive DB lookup against classroom curriculum). Doing this server-side keeps the client simple — just POST the work name strings and the server handles the rest.
- **Backward compat via fallback chains**: Existing children with Sonnet plans still render correctly. No migration needed. Plans naturally upgrade to Haiku format on next refresh.

**F. Child Guru — AI Chat on Each Child's Page — `cd27a059`:**
- Lightweight Haiku chat bubble embedded on every child's page — floating green button bottom-right
- Opens to 360×480px panel with message history, voice recording, and text input
- **Voice-first**: mic button is primary. MediaRecorder → Whisper transcription → send as message
- **Ephemeral**: chat messages live in React state only (cleared between page visits). Actions persist to DB (shelf changes, progress updates, observations all go through existing tool infrastructure).
- **8 curated tools** from the existing 23-tool Guru toolkit: `set_focus_work`, `clear_focus_work`, `update_progress`, `save_observation`, `browse_curriculum`, `search_curriculum`, `get_prioritized_recommendations`, `get_child_recent_activity`
- **Multi-round tool execution**: up to 3 rounds — Haiku calls tools, results fed back, Haiku continues reasoning or composes final response
- **SSE streaming**: ReadableStream with `data: JSON\n\n` format. Event types: status, text, action, error, done
- **Action badges**: tool results shown as inline badges (✓ Shelf updated, ✓ Progress updated, ✓ Observation saved, etc.)
- **System prompt**: "Brief. Warm. Practical. Like a colleague who whispers the answer. 1-3 sentences max."
- **Reuses existing infrastructure**: `buildChildContext()`, `formatContextForPrompt()`, `executeTool()`, `GURU_TOOLS`, Whisper `/api/montree/guru/transcribe`
- **Auth**: `verifySchoolRequest()` + `verifyChildBelongsToSchool()` + rate limit (60 req/min)
- **Bilingual**: all labels have EN/ZH variants via `locale`
- **Teacher-only**: hidden from homeschool parent view via `!isHomeschoolParent(session)` guard
- **Audit fixes**: removed `mode: 'child_guru'` from `montree_guru_interactions` insert (column doesn't exist — Session 10 finding). Added `responseText` accumulator to capture actual AI response text for DB logging instead of echoing user message.
- **Key files**: `app/api/montree/children/[childId]/guru/route.ts` (NEW, 263 lines), `components/montree/child/ChildGuruChat.tsx` (NEW, 415 lines), `app/montree/dashboard/[childId]/page.tsx` (import + render)

**Key files changed this session (8 files, ~940 lines added, ~300 deleted):**
- `components/montree/child/FocusWorksSection.tsx` — game plan header integration, fill shelf button, shelfFilled reset
- `app/montree/dashboard/[childId]/page.tsx` — removed standalone GamePlanCard render, wired FocusWorksSection props + Child Guru
- `app/api/montree/children/[childId]/onboard/route.ts` — Haiku switch, simplified GAME_PLAN_TOOL schema
- `app/api/montree/children/[childId]/game-plan/refresh/route.ts` — Haiku switch, simplified schema
- `app/api/montree/children/[childId]/fill-shelf/route.ts` — NEW: resolve plan works → shelf areas → upsert
- `app/api/montree/children/[childId]/guru/route.ts` — NEW: Child Guru SSE endpoint with 8-tool Haiku
- `components/montree/child/ChildGuruChat.tsx` — NEW: floating chat bubble UI with voice + text
- `components/montree/child/GamePlanCard.tsx` — interface updated for backward compat (component no longer rendered standalone)

**Next session priorities:**
1. **Test Child Guru on production** — tap the green chat bubble on any child's page. Test voice input ("what should I do next with Molly?"), text input ("fill her shelf with sensorial works"), and verify tool actions execute (shelf updates, observations saved).
2. **Test Haiku game plan on production** — Hit "Refresh" to get new Haiku format. Verify nudge is ≤25 words, works are real curriculum names, direction is arrow format.
3. **Test "Fill shelf" on production** — After refreshing plan, verify amber button appears next to work chips. Tap it. Verify shelf areas populate.
4. **Onboard remaining children with game plans** — User plans to onboard all 20 children with voice descriptions + game plans.
5. **Monitor Campaign D** on gmass.co/dashboard — should be finishing up or done by now (~Apr 17 target)
6. **Verify Campaign A** ("Montree" pitch) draft still scheduled for Apr 27 in Gmail Drafts
7. **Consider enabling `tell_guru_onboarding`** for Whale Class — the clamp/validate fix (Session 20) should resolve the reappearing card bug.
8. **Consider removing standalone Guru tab** — Child Guru on each child's page may make the standalone `/montree/dashboard/guru` tab redundant for child-specific queries. Keep it for classroom-wide questions.

### ⚡ Session 20 — Daily Language 6 + Tell Guru Feature Gate + Story Visits + Weekly Activity Summary + New Icon (Apr 12, 2026)

**Seven commits pushed to main: `a10317ca`, `47358e68`, `b38cc7b4`, `a55311a4`, `8202d91d`, `c7dc287e`.**

**THE SESSION:** Six distinct features/fixes, all feature-gated behind super-admin toggles. Plus a complete icon redesign.

**A. Daily Language 6 — `a10317ca`:**
- Pink collapsible widget "📖 Today's Language 6" on the capture page's tag-child screen
- Shows 6 children who most need a Language area observation, excluding those already seen today
- Ordered: never-seen-in-language first → oldest observation date ascending
- API: `GET /api/montree/dashboard/daily-language-6` — queries montree_media → works → areas (area_key='language'), handles group photos via montree_media_children junction table
- Component: `components/montree/capture/DailyLanguageSix.tsx` — child pills with avatar, name, color-coded days badge (red=Never/14d+, amber=7-14d, blue=recent), tappable to toggle child selection
- Feature-gated: `isEnabled('daily_language_6')` — migration 170 defines + enables for Whale Class
- **Key files**: `app/api/montree/dashboard/daily-language-6/route.ts`, `components/montree/capture/DailyLanguageSix.tsx`, `app/montree/dashboard/capture/page.tsx`

**B. Tell Guru Onboarding Bug Fix + Feature Gate — `47358e68`:**
- **Root cause found**: Sonnet `tool_use` returned floats (e.g., 3.5) for INT CHECK(1-5) columns in `montree_child_mental_profiles`. DB rejected the upsert silently, code marked it non-fatal, returned success. Card reappeared because profile was never actually saved.
- **Fix**: Added `clamp15()` (rounds + clamps to 1-5) and `validSP()` (validates enum values) validators in onboard route. Profile save failure now returns HTTP 500.
- **Feature-gated**: `isEnabled('tell_guru_onboarding')` — both the useEffect profile check and the TellGuruCard render are gated. Migration 171 defines feature but does NOT enable for any school (hidden until ready for testing).
- **Key files**: `app/api/montree/children/[childId]/onboard/route.ts`, `app/montree/dashboard/[childId]/page.tsx`

**C. Story Admin: Hide Admin Logins — `b38cc7b4`:**
- User only wants to see Z's logins, not their own admin logins
- Removed `story_admin_login_logs` fetch entirely from login-logs route
- Now only queries `story_login_logs` (user sessions)
- **Key file**: `app/api/story/admin/login-logs/route.ts`

**D. Story Visit Tracking — `a55311a4`:**
- New `story_visits` table tracks every time Z opens/returns to the Story page
- Heartbeat (fires every 30s) checks gap since last `last_seen_at` — if >5 minutes, inserts new visit row
- Otherwise updates `last_active_at` on most recent visit (duration tracking)
- Admin API: `GET /api/story/admin/visits` returns visits with computed `duration_seconds`
- ActivityLogTab rewritten to show "👀 Page Visits" with today's visits highlighted, "stayed Xm" duration
- **Migration 172**: `story_visits` table (id, username, visited_at, last_active_at, ip_address, user_agent) + indexes
- **Key files**: `app/api/story/heartbeat/route.ts`, `app/api/story/admin/visits/route.ts`, `app/story/admin/dashboard/components/ActivityLogTab.tsx`, `app/story/admin/dashboard/hooks/useLoginLogs.ts`

**E. Weekly Activity Summary — `8202d91d`:**
- Short Haiku-generated sentence above the shelf on child week view: "Last week Eric focused heavily on Sensorial. This week, try guiding him toward Language."
- API: `GET /api/montree/children/[childId]/activity-summary` — queries previous week's confirmed photos, counts area distribution, generates 1-2 sentence summary via Haiku (~$0.001/call)
- Cached in child's `settings` JSONB (`activity_summary: { text, week_start, generated_at }`) — only regenerates when week rolls over
- Fallback chain: cached → no-data template → Haiku → template fallback
- Component: `components/montree/child/WeeklyActivitySummary.tsx` — warm amber gradient bar with 💡 icon
- Feature-gated: `isEnabled('weekly_activity_summary')` — migration 173 defines + enables for Whale Class
- **Key files**: `app/api/montree/children/[childId]/activity-summary/route.ts`, `components/montree/child/WeeklyActivitySummary.tsx`, `app/montree/dashboard/[childId]/page.tsx`

**F. New Montree Icon — `c7dc287e`:**
- Replaced old teal "M" square with abstract geometric tree
- 5 overlapping emerald circles = 5 Montessori curriculum areas forming a canopy
- Delicate branching trunk, golden accent dot (sunlight/insight)
- Deep forest green background, iOS-style rounded corners
- Generated at 4096px (4x supersampled), downsampled via Lanczos to all sizes
- **Files replaced**: `icon.svg`, `icon-512.png`, `icon-192.png`, `apple-touch-icon.png` (180px), `favicon-32x32.png`, `montree-icon-only.png`
- **New file**: `montree-icon-1024.png` (master resolution)
- Design philosophy: "Verdant Geometry" — documented in `docs/montree-icon-philosophy.md`

**Migrations run this session:**
- ✅ Migration 170 — `daily_language_6` feature flag (enabled for Whale Class)
- ✅ Migration 171 — `tell_guru_onboarding` feature flag (NOT enabled — hidden until ready)
- ✅ Migration 172 — `story_visits` table + indexes
- ✅ Migration 173 — `weekly_activity_summary` feature flag (enabled for Whale Class)

**Full code audit (2 parallel agents):**
- All 6 commits passed security, auth, memory leak, type safety, Supabase pattern, and feature flag checks
- One minor theoretical race condition on concurrent activity summary Haiku calls (low severity, worst case = wasted $0.001 call)
- All new features properly gated behind `isEnabled()` with safe defaults (OFF unless explicitly enabled)

**Key files changed this session (15 files, ~800 lines added):**
- `app/api/montree/dashboard/daily-language-6/route.ts` — NEW: Language observation recommendations
- `components/montree/capture/DailyLanguageSix.tsx` — NEW: capture page widget
- `app/montree/dashboard/capture/page.tsx` — DailyLanguageSix integration
- `app/api/montree/children/[childId]/onboard/route.ts` — clamp/validate fixes
- `app/api/montree/children/[childId]/activity-summary/route.ts` — NEW: Haiku weekly summary
- `components/montree/child/WeeklyActivitySummary.tsx` — NEW: summary display component
- `app/montree/dashboard/[childId]/page.tsx` — Tell Guru gate + WeeklyActivitySummary integration
- `app/api/story/admin/login-logs/route.ts` — admin logins hidden
- `app/api/story/heartbeat/route.ts` — visit tracking added
- `app/api/story/admin/visits/route.ts` — NEW: visits API
- `app/story/admin/dashboard/components/ActivityLogTab.tsx` — rewritten for visits
- `lib/montree/features/types.ts` — 3 new feature keys
- `public/icon.svg` + all PNG icons — new Montree tree icon

**Next session priorities:**
1. **Test Weekly Activity Summary on production** — tap into a child, verify the amber summary bar appears above the shelf with a Haiku-generated sentence
2. **Test Daily Language 6 on production** — open capture page, verify pink bar shows 6 children with Language observation stats
3. **Test Story visit tracking** — have Z open the Story page, check admin dashboard for visit entries with duration
4. **Monitor Campaign D** on gmass.co/dashboard — should be finishing up (~Apr 17)
5. **Verify Campaign A** ("Montree" pitch) draft still scheduled for Apr 27
6. **Consider enabling `tell_guru_onboarding`** — the clamp/validate fix should resolve the reappearing card bug. Test on a single child first via Supabase: `INSERT INTO montree_school_features (school_id, feature_key, enabled) VALUES ('c6280fae-567c-45ed-ad4d-934eae79aabc', 'tell_guru_onboarding', true) ON CONFLICT (school_id, feature_key) DO UPDATE SET enabled = true;`
7. **Chrome bookmark icon cache** — delete and re-add the Montree Chrome Apps bookmark to pick up the new tree icon

### ⚡ Session 19 — OBS Setup + Video Manager Upload Fix + Story Log Fix + Tell Guru Bug Fixes (Apr 12, 2026)

**Three commits pushed to main: `21a5ffb2`, `97c56ae3`, `e7f2d644`.**

**THE TASK:** Four separate tasks: revert dashboard card layout, fix video uploads, fix Story log spam, fix Tell Guru card bugs. Plus OBS Studio setup for screen recording.

**A. Dashboard Card Layout Revert — `21a5ffb2`:**
- Session 18 changed dashboard to `aspect-square` cards with `content-center` grid alignment
- On phone these bunched at the bottom with huge whitespace above — user requested revert
- Restored original `gridTemplateRows: repeat(rows, 1fr)` viewport-filling pattern
- Removed `aspect-square` and `content-center` from card/grid
- **Key file**: `app/montree/dashboard/page.tsx`

**B. Video Manager Signed URL Upload — (part of `97c56ae3` context, separate feature):**
- Root cause: large video files proxied through Railway → TLS errors (`ERR_SSL_BAD_RECORD_MAC_ALERT`, `ERR_CONNECTION_CLOSED`)
- Fix: two-step signed URL upload — client gets signed URL from server (small JSON request), then uploads directly to Supabase bypassing Railway entirely
- Added `export const maxDuration = 120` to route
- Mode 1: JSON request → server generates signed URL + saves metadata → returns `{ signedUrl }`
- Mode 2: Client PUTs file directly to Supabase signed URL (bypasses Railway)
- **Key files**: `app/api/admin/video-manager/route.ts`, `app/admin/video-manager/page.tsx`

**C. Story Login Log Spam Fix — `97c56ae3`:**
- Railway logs spamming `[Upload Media] Session columns missing — retrying without: login_log_id` and similar on every message send
- Root cause: `app/api/story/admin/send/route.ts`, `app/api/story/upload-media/route.ts`, and `app/api/story/message/route.ts` were inserting `login_log_id`, `session_token`, `is_from_admin` columns that were never added to production DB
- Fix: removed all session-linking fields and retry logic from all three routes. Inserts now use core fields only (week_start_date, message_type, content/url, author, expires_at, is_expired)
- Zero "Session columns missing" warnings going forward
- **Key files**: `app/api/story/admin/send/route.ts`, `app/api/story/upload-media/route.ts`, `app/api/story/message/route.ts`

**D. Tell Guru Bug Fixes — `e7f2d644`:**

Two bugs fixed:

*Bug 1 — "Tell me about Child" instead of child's real name:*
- Root cause: `childName` prop sourced from `session?.classroom?.children?.find(...)` — but `MontreeSession.classroom` type only has `{ id, name, age_group }`. No `children` array exists on the session object. Always returned `undefined`, always fell back to `'Child'`.
- Fix: added `onboardingChildName` state. Profile check `useEffect` now fetches child name in parallel from `/api/montree/children/${childId}` (returns `{ success: true, child: { name, ... } }`). Sets `onboardingChildName` from `childData.child.name`.
- TellGuruCard now receives real name. Fallback changed from `'Child'` → `'this child'`.

*Bug 2 — Card reappears after completing onboarding:*
- Root cause: Profile GET endpoint had `Cache-Control: private, max-age=120, stale-while-revalidate=300`. Browser cached `{ profile: null }` response for 2 minutes. After onboarding saved the profile to DB, navigating away and back within 2 minutes served the stale cached null, making `hasProfile = false` and showing the card again.
- Fix: Changed profile GET `Cache-Control` to `no-store`.
- **Key files**: `app/montree/dashboard/[childId]/page.tsx`, `app/api/montree/children/[childId]/profile/route.ts`

**E. OBS Studio Setup (no git commit — local Mac config only):**
- User had OBS 32.1.1 installed but unconfigured
- Scene collection "Tredoux" created at `~/Library/Application Support/obs-studio/basic/scenes/Tredoux.json`
- Profile output paths updated to Desktop (`~/Library/Application Support/obs-studio/basic/profiles/Untitled/basic.ini`)
- **User manually set up** (via OBS UI — JSON injection approach failed because OBS overwrites the file when active):
  - Scene "Tredoux2" with sources: macOS Screen Capture (Display Capture, Built-in Retina 1440×900) + Video Capture Device (FaceTime HD Camera)
  - Webcam visible top-right of preview
  - System audio captured (macOS Audio Capture channel — green bars moving on speaker output)
  - **Microphone NOT yet configured** — user needs to go to OBS Settings → Audio → Mic/Auxiliary Audio → Built-in Microphone (or DJI Mic Mini when receiver is plugged in)
- Recording saves to Desktop as `.mov` file, named `YYYY-MM-DD HH-MM-SS`
- **DJI Mic Mini**: plug receiver into USB-C → shows up automatically as audio device → select in OBS Settings → Audio

**YouTube videos downloaded this session (H.264 MP4, Desktop):**

**Health checks:**
- ✅ Dashboard revert: viewport-filling grid restored
- ✅ Story routes: no dead column inserts
- ✅ Tell Guru: name fetched from child API, cache disabled on profile endpoint
- ✅ OBS: screen + webcam recording working, files save to Desktop
- ✅ All 3 commits deployed to Railway

**Next session priorities:**
1. **Add mic to OBS** — Settings → Audio → Mic/Auxiliary Audio → Built-in Microphone. Test voice is captured.
2. **Test Tell Guru on production** — tap a child without a profile, verify name shows correctly (not "Child"), complete voice description, navigate away and back — card should NOT reappear
3. **Monitor Campaign D** on gmass.co/dashboard — should be finishing up (~Apr 17). Check open rates and bounce rate.
4. **Verify Campaign A** ("Montree" pitch) draft still scheduled for Apr 27 in Gmail Drafts
5. **Test Classroom Builder duplicate detection** — type an existing student name, verify "Already in classroom" warning
6. **Test parent dashboard on phone** — verify latest report loads inline, photo lightbox works
7. **Consider "Tell Guru" post-Classroom-Builder flow** — after adding students via Classroom Builder, prompt teacher to describe each new child

### ⚡ Session 18 — Dashboard Polish + "Tell Guru" Voice Onboarding + Security Fix (Apr 12, 2026)

**Ten commits pushed to main: `f48cc08f` through `35c501b7`.**

**THE TASK:** Multiple UI polish requests + a new voice-first child onboarding feature + a security fix.

**A. Dashboard Polish (6 commits):**
- **`f48cc08f`** — Added 'Molly' to WHALE_CLASS_ORDER (position 19, 21 names total)
- **`e0671f30`** — Capture page: moved capture button to RIGHT side (thumb-friendly), child tagging grid now auto-fits screen with zero scrolling using dynamic CSS Grid (`gridTemplateColumns: repeat(cols, 1fr)`, `gridTemplateRows: repeat(rows, 1fr)`)
- **`7cb0cf07`** — Added ← back button to child tagging screen (router.back())
- **`3778c0b1`** — Story photos: `object-cover h-48` → `object-contain` (show full photos)
- **`8d92773c`** — Dashboard: students-only screen. Removed Paperwork Tracker, Teacher Tools, Birthday Banner, Daily Brief from page (all still accessible via "..." menu). Student grid uses same auto-fit pattern as capture page.
- **`aea5527f`** — Dashboard: square student cards. Changed from stretched rectangles (`gridTemplateRows: repeat(rows, 1fr)`) to `aspect-square` cards with `content-center` grid alignment.
- **`96e04c44`** — Dashboard: removed "+" Add card from grid. Students are now added exclusively via Classroom Builder in the "..." menu.

**B. SECURITY FIX — `0116145c`:**
- **Story login page** (`app/story/page.tsx`) was showing "Recent Updates" section with message activity (usernames, "sent a message", timestamps) — completely broke the secrecy of the messaging system.
- **Removed**: `RecentMessage` interface, `recentMessages` state, `useEffect` fetch to `/api/story/recent-messages`, `getTypeIcon()`, `formatTime()`, all JSX rendering messages.
- Page now shows ONLY the login form (Parent Name + Access Code + button).

**C. Paperwork Tracker Priority — `dfc0d7f6`:**
- Students sorted by `weeks_behind` descending within each section (most behind first)
- Reversed section render order: "Needs catch-up" FIRST → "Almost there" → "Up to date" (collapsed by default)
- **Key file**: `components/montree/PaperworkPanel.tsx` (lines 187-189, 389-474)

**D. Classroom Builder Duplicate Detection — `35c501b7`:**
- Preview step now checks new names against existing children in classroom
- Names that already exist show "Already in classroom" and are skipped
- Case-insensitive comparison using `Set` of existing names
- **Key file**: `app/montree/dashboard/classroom-builder/page.tsx` (lines 129-131)

**E. "Tell Guru" Voice Onboarding — `02dd3118` (THE BIG FEATURE):**

New voice-first onboarding for children without mental profiles. When teacher taps into a child with no `montree_child_mental_profiles` row, a green card appears: "Tell me about [Child]" with a mic button.

**Flow:**
1. Teacher taps mic → speaks freely about the child (experience, personality, strengths, challenges)
2. Recording timer with encouraging messages ("Take your time..." → "Great, keep going..." → "Wonderful detail!")
3. Tap stop → Whisper transcribes → Sonnet extracts structured profile via `tool_use`
4. Profile saved to `montree_child_mental_profiles`, curriculum positions seeded, raw transcript saved as teacher note
5. Card disappears → normal child view, now enriched

**Also supports "or type instead"** — textarea fallback if voice isn't practical.

**Extraction via Sonnet `tool_use`** (`save_child_profile` tool):
- Experience level: new / some / experienced / advanced
- Curriculum levels per area: 0-100 scale mapped to Montessori progression landmarks
- Temperament: 9 traits on 1-5 scale (activity, persistence, adaptability, mood, etc.)
- Learning modality: visual / auditory / kinesthetic (1-5)
- Focus: baseline minutes, optimal time of day
- Sensitive periods: 6 periods with status
- Context: family notes, special considerations, strategies, triggers

**Curriculum seeding**: For non-new children, seeds `montree_child_work_progress` based on extracted levels. E.g., if teacher says "she's been doing Montessori for 2 years, loves the pink tower" → sensorial set to ~35%, first third of sensorial works marked mastered, next few practicing/presented.

**Key files:**
- `components/montree/onboarding/TellGuruCard.tsx` — voice recording UI (331 lines)
- `app/api/montree/children/[childId]/onboard/route.ts` — Sonnet extraction + DB writes (364 lines)
- `app/montree/dashboard/[childId]/page.tsx` — hasProfile state + conditional render

**F. Health Check Results (end of session):**
- **Production pages**: ✅ All loading (montree.xyz → 302, /story → 200, /montree/login → 200, /tools/*.html → 200)
- **Story security**: ✅ No "recent updates" or message activity visible on /story page (grep confirms 0 matches)
- **API auth**: ✅ Protected endpoints return 401 without cookies (correct)
- **Code audit**: ✅ All 11 files pass — no missing imports, no memory leaks, no security issues, no logic bugs
- **Railway deploy**: ✅ All 10 commits deployed (35c501b7 on main)

**Key architectural decisions this session:**
- **Auto-fit grid pattern**: Reusable CSS Grid approach with dynamic `cols`/`rows` and `1fr` sizing. Applied to both capture page child selector and dashboard student grid. The capture page uses `gridTemplateRows: repeat(rows, 1fr)` (fills viewport) while the dashboard uses `aspect-square` + `content-center` (natural sizing, centered).
- **Voice-first over forms**: Replaced the complex Add Student modal (Name + Age + Gender + Time at School + Current Work per Area) with voice recording. A 30-second voice note gives Sonnet more context than 6 form fields ever could.
- **Single entry point for adding students**: Classroom Builder is now THE way to add students. The complex Add Student modal and the dashboard "+" card are both gone. Classroom Builder handles both bulk setup and single additions with built-in duplicate detection.

**Key files changed this session (11 files, +880/-280 lines):**
- `app/api/montree/children/[childId]/onboard/route.ts` — NEW: voice transcript → profile extraction
- `components/montree/onboarding/TellGuruCard.tsx` — NEW: voice recording + onboarding UI
- `app/montree/dashboard/[childId]/page.tsx` — hasProfile check + TellGuruCard render
- `app/montree/dashboard/page.tsx` — students-only grid, removed sections
- `app/montree/dashboard/capture/page.tsx` — button right + no-scroll grid + back button
- `app/montree/dashboard/classroom-builder/page.tsx` — duplicate name detection
- `app/story/page.tsx` — SECURITY: removed Recent Updates
- `app/story/[session]/page.tsx` — full photos (object-contain)
- `components/montree/PaperworkPanel.tsx` — sort by most behind first
- `components/montree/media/CameraCapture.tsx` — capture button to right side
- `lib/montree/weekly-admin/child-order.ts` — added Molly

**Next session priorities:**
1. **Test "Tell Guru" on production** — add a test student via Classroom Builder, tap into them, verify the voice card appears, record a description, verify profile is extracted and curriculum seeded
2. **Test Classroom Builder duplicate detection** — type an existing name (e.g., "Amy"), verify it shows "Already in classroom" on preview
3. **Test dashboard on phone** — verify square cards look good, no scrolling, capture button on right is comfortable
4. **Monitor Campaign D** on gmass.co/dashboard — should be done by ~Apr 17
5. **Verify Campaign A** ("Montree" pitch) draft still scheduled for Apr 27
6. **Consider adding "Tell Guru" to the post-Classroom-Builder flow** — after creating students, prompt teacher to tell Guru about each one (guided walkthrough)
7. **Consider removing the old Add Student modal entirely** — it's still accessible from the Students page but no longer the primary path

### ⚡ Session 17 — Complete Quick Guide Chinese Pre-Cache + Auto-Generation Pipeline (Apr 12, 2026)

**One commit pushed to main: `ac5426f2` (guide route auto-Chinese-generation).**

**THE TASK:** Pre-cache Chinese translations of ALL quick guides so Chinese school users never wait for an API call. Also build in automatic Chinese generation for any future works (including custom works).

**A. Batch Translation — All 384 Whale Class Works Now Have Both English + Chinese Quick Guides:**
- **38 custom works** had NO `quick_guide` at all (created via Photo Audit, never got guide content). Generated both English and Chinese for all 38 using Haiku `tool_use` structured output.
- **346 standard works** had English guides but no Chinese. Translated all to Chinese via Haiku `tool_use`.
- **20 works** initially got stub guides (<50 chars — Haiku echoed the work name back instead of generating content). Regenerated with stronger prompts forcing 200+ word output. All now 3000-6800 chars.
- **DB state: 384/384 works have `quick_guide` (English) + `guide_content_zh` (Chinese JSONB).** Zero API calls needed for any user opening quick guides in either language.
- Scripts used: `scripts/batch-translate-guides-haiku.js`, `scripts/generate-custom-guides.js`, `scripts/fix-short-guides.js` (all one-off, can be deleted)
- Cost: ~$0.40 total (Haiku `tool_use` calls)
- Network issues on user's Mac caused intermittent `TypeError: fetch failed` errors throughout — scripts had retry logic with 30s timeouts per API call, ran multiple cleanup passes

**B. Code Change — Auto-Generate Chinese in Background (commit `ac5426f2`):**
- **File**: `app/api/montree/works/guide/route.ts` — lines 168-195
- When an English quick guide is served and `classroomId` exists, a fire-and-forget background check runs:
  1. Query DB for `guide_content_zh` on that work
  2. If null → call existing `translateGuideToZh()` (Sonnet) → cache result to `guide_content_zh`
- **Covers all future works automatically**: any custom work created via Photo Audit, add-custom-work, or classroom setup will get its Chinese guide pre-cached the first time anyone opens the English version
- The English response returns immediately — background translation doesn't block the user
- Idempotent: checks cache existence before translating, so repeated English requests don't trigger redundant translations

**C. Migration 169 — `guide_content_zh` Column (already run in prior session):**
- `ALTER TABLE montree_classroom_curriculum_works ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS guide_content_zh JSONB;`
- JSONB structure matches the guide API response: `{ quick_guide, presentation_steps, materials, direct_aims, control_of_error, why_it_matters, parent_description, name }`

**D. `story_message_history.is_from_admin` Column — ✅ FIXED (user ran SQL Apr 12):**
- Migration `20260118_story_session_linking.sql` existed in git but was never executed on production
- Railway logs showed repeated: `[Upload Media] Session columns missing — retrying without: Could not find the 'is_from_admin' column`
- User ran `ALTER TABLE story_message_history ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS is_from_admin BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;` in Supabase SQL Editor
- Code already had retry fallback stripping the column — now the column exists, retries won't trigger, logs will be clean

**Key technical decisions:**
- **Haiku `tool_use` over raw JSON**: Haiku consistently produces malformed JSON when asked to output raw text (unescaped quotes, fullwidth punctuation in Chinese). `tool_use` structured output eliminates this entirely — the API handles JSON serialization. Same pattern used for teacher reports.
- **Background pre-generation on English requests**: Rather than requiring a separate Chinese request to trigger caching, English requests opportunistically pre-generate Chinese. This means the first parent who opens a guide in Chinese gets instant response even if no Chinese user has visited before.
- **Sequential processing with 30s timeouts**: Parallel Haiku calls would be faster but risk rate limiting. Sequential with per-call timeouts ensures progress even with flaky network — failures skip quickly and cleanup passes catch them.

**Key files changed this session:**
- `app/api/montree/works/guide/route.ts` — background Chinese pre-generation (lines 168-195)

**Audit results (verified programmatically):**
- 384/384 works: `quick_guide` populated ✅
- 384/384 works: `guide_content_zh` populated ✅
- 0 works with short English guides (<50 chars) ✅
- 0 works with short Chinese guides (<20 chars) ✅
- All `guide_content_zh` values are valid JSONB objects with `quick_guide` string field ✅

**Next session priorities:**
1. **Test quick guides on production** — hard-refresh a work's quick guide in both English and Chinese locale, verify instant load (no spinner/delay)
2. **Monitor Campaign D** on gmass.co/dashboard — should be done by ~Apr 17, check open rates
3. **Verify Campaign A** ("Montree" pitch) draft still scheduled for Apr 27
4. **Test camera viewfinder on phone** (from Session 16) — verify 4:3 overlay + crop
5. **Test parent dashboard on production** (from Session 16) — verify latest report loads inline
6. **Consider cleaning up one-off scripts**: `scripts/batch-translate-guides-haiku.js`, `scripts/generate-custom-guides.js`, `scripts/fix-short-guides.js` can be deleted

### ⚡ Session 16 — Parent Dashboard Redesign + Camera 4:3 Viewfinder + Hide Invite Parent (Apr 11, 2026)

**Two commits pushed to main: `8651f8cf` (parent dashboard), `81e5ab0b` (camera viewfinder + hide invite parent).**

**THE TASK:** Three user requests in one session:
1. Strip the parent dashboard down to essentials — child name hero + latest report inline + collapsed past reports
2. Hide the "Invite Parent" link on the teacher's child gallery page
3. Overhaul the camera capture system — fix landscape black space, add 4:3 WYSIWYG viewfinder overlay matching parent report aspect ratio

**A. Parent Dashboard Complete Rewrite (commit `8651f8cf`):**
- **File**: `app/montree/parent/dashboard/page.tsx` — 655 lines, complete rewrite (was ~590 lines of cluttered sections)
- **Removed**: announcements, stats panels, photo gallery section, milestones, games, recent activity — ALL stripped
- **What remains**:
  - Sticky header: Montree logo + language toggle + sign out
  - Multi-child selector (horizontal pill buttons, only shows if >1 child)
  - Child hero: large avatar circle (gradient with initial, or photo) + first name (large, bold) + week date range
  - Quick stat pills: mastered/practicing/new counts with emoji + color badges
  - Narrative summary: emerald left-border blockquote with full parent narrative
  - Photo cards: full-width 4:3 images with area badge, work name, status pill, `parent_description`, `why_it_matters` box, teacher note box. Tappable for lightbox.
  - Extra photos: 2-col grid for report photos without work assignments
  - Recommendations: "Try This at Home" section
  - Closing: centered closing message
  - Past Reports: collapsed accordion with chevron toggle, links to individual report pages via `<Link>`
  - Footer: minimal "Montree" text
- **Auto-loads latest report**: `loadReports()` → `loadFullReport(reports[0].id)` — no user tap needed, report is inline immediately
- **Bilingual**: all labels, stat pills, area names, status badges, empty states in EN/ZH via `locale`
- **New imports**: `LanguageToggle`, `PhotoLightbox` (lightbox wired for all photo works + extras)
- **Design**: clean white background, max-w-lg centered, emerald accent color, no cards/borders — content-forward magazine feel

**B. Hide Invite Parent (commit `81e5ab0b`):**
- **File**: `app/montree/dashboard/[childId]/gallery/page.tsx`
- Lines 1087-1097: replaced invite parent button block with comment `{/* Invite Parent link — hidden, parent flow now handled via Weekly Wrap send */}`
- `InviteParentModal` component import and definition left in place (unused but harmless — tree-shaking removes it from client bundle)

**C. Camera 4:3 Viewfinder Overlay (commit `81e5ab0b`):**
- **File**: `components/montree/media/CameraCapture.tsx` — 821 lines (was 742)
- **New constant**: `TARGET_ASPECT = 4/3` — matches parent report photo display (`aspect-[4/3] object-cover`)
- **New state**: `viewfinder: { x, y, w, h } | null` — computed rectangle of the 4:3 zone, `isLandscape: boolean`
- **New ref**: `containerRef` on the camera view div for dimension tracking
- **`updateViewfinder()` callback**: calculates largest 4:3 rectangle fitting container with 4% margin. Called by ResizeObserver, `onloadedmetadata`, window resize, and orientationchange.
- **Viewfinder overlay** (z-10, pointer-events-none):
  - 4 dark panels (`bg-black/45`) around the clear 4:3 zone
  - White corner brackets (4 corners, 24px arms, 2.5px thick, `bg-white/80`)
  - Subtle "4:3" label below the zone (`text-white/50`)
- **Three-tier capture in `capturePhoto()`**:
  - Tier 1: `!vw || !vh` — video dimensions unavailable, raw frame fallback
  - Tier 2: `!viewfinder` — ResizeObserver race, centered 4:3 crop from video directly
  - Tier 3: viewfinder-mapped crop (primary path) — `object-cover` coordinate mapping:
    ```
    scale = Math.max(cw/vw, ch/vh)
    offX = (cw - vw*scale) / 2, offY = (ch - vh*scale) / 2
    srcX = (viewfinder.x - offX) / scale, srcY = (viewfinder.y - offY) / scale
    srcW = viewfinder.w / scale, srcH = viewfinder.h / scale
    ctx.drawImage(video, srcX, srcY, srcW, srcH, 0, 0, srcW, srcH)
    ```
  - Math verified numerically: portrait (390×700, 1920×1080 video) → 554×415 crop = 4:3 ✓; landscape (700×390, 1920×1080 video) → 1312×984 crop = 4:3 ✓
- **Landscape compact controls**: `isLandscape` detection (`cw > ch`), capture button shrinks `w-20 h-20 → w-16 h-16`, switch camera `w-14 h-14 → w-12 h-12`, `py-4 → py-2`
- **Listener cleanup**: ResizeObserver with `.disconnect()`, named `handleOrientation` function properly removed (fixed anonymous arrow function memory leak), `onloadedmetadata` callback on video element
- **`showViewfinder` guard**: hidden during capture preview, video mode, and error state

**Key technical decisions:**
- **Object-cover coordinate mapping**: `Math.max(cw/vw, ch/vh)` computes the CSS `object-cover` scale factor. Display offset accounts for the overflow crop. Viewfinder display coords map to video pixel coords via `(displayCoord - offset) / scale`.
- **ResizeObserver over window.resize**: more reliable for container dimension changes (especially orientation changes on mobile where the browser chrome resizes the container independently of the window)
- **`onloadedmetadata`**: fires when video stream dimensions become available — more reliable than `setTimeout` for initial viewfinder calculation
- **Three-tier fallback**: ensures capture never fails regardless of timing — Tier 1 is pure fallback, Tier 2 is correct-math-without-viewfinder, Tier 3 is the WYSIWYG path

**Bugs fixed during implementation:**
- Memory leak: `orientationchange` listener used anonymous arrow → fixed with named `handleOrientation`
- Timing fragility: `setTimeout(updateViewfinder, 200)` → replaced with `onloadedmetadata` callback
- Null viewfinder race: added Tier 2 centered crop fallback for captures before ResizeObserver fires

**Key files changed this session:**
- `app/montree/parent/dashboard/page.tsx` — complete rewrite (parent-facing dashboard)
- `components/montree/media/CameraCapture.tsx` — 4:3 viewfinder overlay + auto-crop
- `app/montree/dashboard/[childId]/gallery/page.tsx` — invite parent link hidden

**Next session priorities:**
1. **Test camera viewfinder on phone** — hard-refresh capture page on production, verify 4:3 overlay renders correctly in both portrait and landscape, verify captured photos are correctly cropped to the viewfinder zone
2. **Test parent dashboard on production** — verify latest report loads inline, photo lightbox works, past reports accordion functions
3. **Monitor Campaign D** on gmass.co/dashboard — verify 50/day throttle working, check open rates (should be done by ~Apr 17)
4. **Verify dead Campaign C** (50686495) has no pending follow-ups on gmass.co/dashboard
5. **Verify Campaign A** ("Montree" pitch) draft still scheduled for Apr 27
6. **Consider `/tools/` index page** — landing page linking to all 5 curriculum guides (currently direct URLs only)
7. **Test new classroom creation end-to-end** — create a test classroom via principal setup, verify Chinese names are auto-seeded (Session 14 fix)

### ⚡ Session 15 — Complete Home Curriculum Guide Suite (5 areas × 100 works) + Library Integration (Apr 11, 2026)

**Six commits pushed to main: `50acbb64` (Practical Life, prev session), `505a10ca` (Language), `ffd0d9fc` (Sensorial), `8ba5d56b` (Mathematics), `888c0aab` (Cultural), `17ad1873` (Library page).**

**THE TASK:** Create a complete set of Montessori home curriculum HTML files — one for each of the 5 curriculum areas — in a beautiful, printable format accessible from `montree.xyz/tools/`. Each follows an identical structure: 100 works from developmental zero to mastery, organized in 4 developmental phases of 25 works, with sensitive period callouts between phases. Every work card includes: name, what it develops, readiness signs, and a home version requiring NO Montessori catalogue materials.

**Files created (all in `public/tools/`):**

| File | Phases | Colour Scheme | Size |
|------|--------|---------------|------|
| `practical-life-curriculum.html` | Foundations → Growing Will → Prepared Child → Normalization | Green | 127KB |
| `language-curriculum.html` | The Ear → The Hand → The Eye → The Mind | Pink/Purple | 139KB |
| `sensorial-curriculum.html` | Dimension & Order → Colour Form & Pattern → Hidden Senses → Sensation to Abstraction | Purple/Amber | 141KB |
| `mathematics-curriculum.html` | Concrete Mind → Working Hand → Reasoning Mind → Passage to Abstraction | Blue | 87KB |
| `cultural-curriculum.html` | Near World → Living World → Wider World → Cosmic View | Deep Purple | 96KB |

**Design system (consistent across all 5):**
- Typography: Cormorant Garamond (headings, quotes) + Inter (body)
- Google Fonts loaded via `@import`
- CSS variables per file for phase colours (`--phase1` through `--phase4`)
- Hero: full-width gradient banner with title, subtitle, meta
- Intro: Montessori quote in styled blockquote, 2-3 paragraphs of context
- Phase headers: coloured pill tag + serif heading + description
- Work cards: white with subtle shadow, number badge top-right, four fields (name, develops, readiness, home version in tinted box)
- Sensitive period callouts: dark gradient box with glow effect, age range, descriptive text
- Print CSS: `break-inside: avoid` on cards, `print-color-adjust: exact` on gradients
- Mobile responsive: stacked layout at 640px breakpoint
- Footer: Montree brand + link to montree.xyz

**Content grounding:**
- Language: grounded in `lib/curriculum/data/language.json` (45 works across 5 categories)
- Sensorial: grounded in `lib/curriculum/data/sensorial.json` (35 works across 10 categories)
- Cultural: grounded in `lib/curriculum/data/cultural.json` (63 works across 7 categories: Geography, History, Botany, Zoology, Science, Art, Music)
- Mathematics: no `mathematics.json` exists — grounded in standard Montessori math sequence (number rods, golden beads, stamp game, strip boards, bead chains, fraction circles, etc.)
- Practical Life: created in prior session, grounded in standard Montessori practical life sequence
- Sensitive periods: referenced from `lib/montree/guru/knowledge/sensitive-periods.ts` (8 periods with age ranges and peak windows)

**Library page integration (commit `17ad1873`):**
- Added "Home Curriculum Guides" card to `app/montree/library/page.tsx` between Picture Bank and Browse the Library
- Emerald accent gradient to match Montessori brand
- Five colour-coded pill buttons (one per area) with direct links to `/tools/*.html`
- Each pill opens in a new tab (`target="_blank"`)
- Pill colours match each curriculum's hero gradient: Practical Life (#40916c), Sensorial (#d4883e), Language (#c0566e), Mathematics (#2e7dba), Cultural (#8b6bb5)
- Uses `<a>` tags (not Next.js `<Link>`) since these are static HTML files outside the Next.js router
- `onClick={(e) => e.stopPropagation()}` on pills to prevent the parent card click from interfering

**Production URLs:**
- `montree.xyz/tools/practical-life-curriculum.html`
- `montree.xyz/tools/language-curriculum.html`
- `montree.xyz/tools/sensorial-curriculum.html`
- `montree.xyz/tools/mathematics-curriculum.html`
- `montree.xyz/tools/cultural-curriculum.html`
- Library page: `montree.xyz/montree/library`

**Middleware note:** Static `.html` files in `public/tools/` are excluded from Next.js middleware processing by the matcher regex at `middleware.ts` line 353 (excludes `.html` extension). No middleware changes needed.

**Technical issues encountered and resolved this session:**
- **Git lock files**: `fatal: cannot lock ref 'HEAD': Unable to create '.git/HEAD.lock'` — resolved by `rm -f .git/index.lock .git/HEAD.lock` via Desktop Commander before each git operation
- **Railway Docker Hub network error**: `dial tcp [2600:1f18:...]:443: connect: network is unreachable` when pulling `node:20-slim` — resolved by pushing empty retry commit to trigger new build (transient Docker Hub issue)
- **404 on production for new HTML files**: caused by the Docker Hub build failure above, not a code issue. Retry deploy fixed it.

**Key files changed this session:**
- `public/tools/practical-life-curriculum.html` — 100-work Practical Life (prev session, committed this session)
- `public/tools/language-curriculum.html` — 100-work Language
- `public/tools/sensorial-curriculum.html` — 100-work Sensorial
- `public/tools/mathematics-curriculum.html` — 100-work Mathematics
- `public/tools/cultural-curriculum.html` — 100-work Cultural
- `app/montree/library/page.tsx` — Home Curriculum Guides card with 5 pill links

**Next session priorities:**
1. **Verify all 5 curriculum guides render on production** — hard-refresh each URL after Railway deploy
2. **Monitor Campaign D** on gmass.co/dashboard — verify 50/day throttle working, check open rates
3. **Verify dead Campaign C** (50686495) has no pending follow-ups on gmass.co/dashboard
4. **Verify Campaign A** ("Montree" pitch) draft still scheduled for Apr 27
5. **Test new classroom creation end-to-end** — create a test classroom via principal setup, verify Chinese names are auto-seeded (Session 14 fix)
6. **Consider adding an index/landing page** for `/tools/` that links to all curriculum guides (currently no index — direct URLs only)

### ⚡ Session 14 — Comprehensive Chinese Locale Fix: Dual-Column Root Cause + All UI Components (Apr 11, 2026)

**Two commits pushed to main: `1f7b2dea` + `7976f5bc`.**

**THE ROOT CAUSE (finally found after 5-10+ attempts across sessions):**
The DB has TWO Chinese name columns on `montree_classroom_curriculum_works`:
- `name_chinese` (added migration 099) — **read by UI** (`CurriculumWorkList.tsx` line 120: `locale === 'zh' && work.name_chinese ? work.name_chinese : work.name`)
- `name_zh` (added migration 149) — **written by auto-translate** (`autoTranslateToChinese()`, `batchTranslateWorksInBackground()`, etc.)

All 384 Whale Class works had `name_zh` populated (Session 13) but `name_chinese = NULL`. The UI was checking `name_chinese`, which was always null, so it always fell back to the English name. This is why every session that "fixed" Chinese translation appeared to work on the API side but never showed up in the UI.

**THE FIX — Commit `1f7b2dea` (7 files):**
All 7 code paths that write Chinese work names now write BOTH `name_zh` AND `name_chinese`:
1. `lib/montree/auto-translate.ts` — fire-and-forget translation now writes both columns
2. `app/api/montree/curriculum/batch-translate/route.ts` — both Haiku and glossary paths write both
3. `app/api/montree/principal/setup-stream/route.ts` — seeds both from static JSON `chineseName`
4. `app/api/montree/principal/setup/route.ts` — seeds both from static JSON `chineseName`
5. `app/api/montree/guru/photo-insight/add-custom-work/route.ts` — writes `name_chinese` alongside `name_zh`
6. `app/api/montree/admin/reseed-curriculum/route.ts` — seeds both from static JSON
7. `app/api/montree/admin/backfill-curriculum/route.ts` — already had `name_chinese`, added `name_zh`

DB sync also run: `UPDATE montree_classroom_curriculum_works SET name_chinese = name_zh WHERE name_zh IS NOT NULL AND (name_chinese IS NULL OR name_chinese = '');` — 384 rows updated.

**THE FIX — Commit `7976f5bc` (9 files) — All remaining UI components:**

*Work name rendering — 6 components fixed:*
- **`components/montree/WorkWheelPicker.tsx`** — 4 render locations (global search results, wheel items, position picker, selected work name) now check `locale === 'zh' && work.name_chinese`
- **`components/montree/AreaSpinnerWheel.tsx`** — spinner work names now locale-aware, added `name_chinese` to `SpinnerWork` interface
- **`components/montree/photo-audit/ThisIsSheet.tsx`** — AI guess card + search results show Chinese names, added `work_name_chinese` to `aiGuess` type, resolves from loaded classroom works
- **`components/montree/curriculum/DuplicateSheet.tsx`** — duplicate work list shows Chinese names
- **`components/montree/curriculum/CurriculumWorkList.tsx`** — expanded detail view: `parent_description` → `parent_description_zh`, `why_it_matters` → `why_it_matters_zh` when locale is zh
- **`components/montree/curriculum/types.ts`** — added `parent_description_zh`, `why_it_matters_zh` to `Work` interface

*Data pipeline fixes:*
- **`app/api/montree/curriculum/route.ts`** — seed action now includes `name_chinese: work.chineseName` + `name_zh: work.chineseName` from static JSON (was missing entirely — new classrooms seeded via this endpoint would get no Chinese names)
- **`app/api/montree/progress/route.ts`** — added DB Chinese name fallback: fetches child's classroom curriculum `name_chinese` and merges into progress data. Covers custom works that the static JSON `enrichWithChineseNames()` doesn't have. Two-pass enrichment: static JSON first (270/329), DB fallback second.
- **`lib/montree/curriculum/duplicate-detection.ts`** — added `name_chinese` to `WorkCandidate` interface

**Components already correct (no changes needed):**
- `CurriculumWorkList.tsx` line 120 — already had `locale === 'zh' && work.name_chinese`
- `FocusWorksSection.tsx` lines 237, 411 — already checked `locale === 'zh' && focusWork.chineseName`
- `WeeklyWrapTab.tsx` — already had `work.name_zh` check

**Content translation (detail views):**
- **Inline expanded view** (CurriculumWorkList): `parent_description_zh` and `why_it_matters_zh` from DB columns (populated by auto-translate)
- **FullDetailsModal + QuickGuideModal**: fetched via `/api/montree/works/guide?locale=zh` which runs ALL content fields (quick_guide, presentation_steps, direct_aims, materials, control_of_error, why_it_matters) through Sonnet translation. Both curriculum page and child page already pass `locale=zh`.

**🚨 CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL NOTES FOR FUTURE SESSIONS:**
- **`name_chinese` is the UI column** — checked by CurriculumWorkList, DuplicateSheet, AreaSpinnerWheel, WorkWheelPicker, ThisIsSheet
- **`name_zh` is the translate column** — written by auto-translate, batch-translate
- **ALWAYS write BOTH** when setting Chinese names. The `auto-translate.ts` function is the canonical place.
- **`chineseName` (camelCase)** — used in static JSON files (`lib/curriculum/data/*.json`) and in the `enrichWithChineseNames()` runtime enrichment function
- **`chinese_name` (snake_case in API responses)** — used in some API response mappings
- **Never assume one column implies the other** — they were historically independent

**10 bad translations fixed manually (earlier in session via direct DB UPDATE):**
- "Cutting" → "剪纸工作" (was "剪" — too short)
- "Sandpaper Letter Rubbings" → "砂纸字母拓印" (was "砂纸字母rubbing" — half-English)
- 8 others with similar issues

**Data state after this session:**
- 384/384 Whale Class works: both `name_chinese` AND `name_zh` populated
- 317/384 works: `parent_description_zh` populated
- ~270/329 standard works: static JSON `chineseName` available for runtime enrichment
- All 7 work creation paths seed Chinese names (static JSON on INSERT + auto-translate background)
- New classrooms get Chinese translations automatically via `batchTranslateWorksInBackground()`

**Key files changed:**
- `lib/montree/auto-translate.ts` — writes both `name_zh` + `name_chinese`
- `app/api/montree/curriculum/route.ts` — seed includes `name_chinese` + `name_zh` from static JSON
- `app/api/montree/curriculum/batch-translate/route.ts` — writes both columns
- `app/api/montree/progress/route.ts` — DB Chinese name fallback for child dashboard
- `components/montree/WorkWheelPicker.tsx` — 4 locale checks
- `components/montree/AreaSpinnerWheel.tsx` — locale check + `name_chinese` on interface
- `components/montree/photo-audit/ThisIsSheet.tsx` — locale checks + `work_name_chinese` on aiGuess
- `components/montree/curriculum/CurriculumWorkList.tsx` — `parent_description_zh` + `why_it_matters_zh` in expanded view
- `components/montree/curriculum/DuplicateSheet.tsx` — locale check
- `components/montree/curriculum/types.ts` — `parent_description_zh`, `why_it_matters_zh` fields
- `lib/montree/curriculum/duplicate-detection.ts` — `name_chinese` on `WorkCandidate`

**Next session priorities:**
1. **Verify on production** — hard-refresh curriculum page, child dashboard, photo audit. ALL work names should render in Chinese when locale is zh.
2. **Monitor Campaign D** on gmass.co/dashboard — verify 50/day throttle working, check open rates
3. **Verify dead Campaign C** (50686495) has no pending follow-ups on gmass.co/dashboard
4. **Verify Campaign A** ("Montree" pitch) draft still scheduled for Apr 27
5. **Test new classroom creation end-to-end** — create a test classroom via principal setup, verify Chinese names are auto-seeded

### ⚡ Session 13 — Complete Chinese Translation Coverage + Auto-Translate Pipeline (Apr 10-11, 2026)

**One commit pushed to main: `0a82fcf4`.**

**THE PROBLEM:** All 384 Whale Class works had `name_zh = null` in `montree_classroom_curriculum_works`. When generating Chinese parent reports, work names appeared in English because there was no Chinese name to display. The review API's `getChineseWorkName()` only looked at the DB and had no fallback. Additionally, new works added to the curriculum (via principal setup, photo audit, etc.) were not always getting Chinese translations.

**THE FIX — 4 files changed (commit `0a82fcf4`):**

1. **`app/api/montree/reports/weekly-wrap/review/route.ts`** — `getChineseWorkName()` enhanced with 6-step fallback cascade:
   - Step 1: DB exact match (`workNameToChinese` map from `name_zh` column)
   - Step 2: Strip " - suffix" variants → DB match
   - Step 3: Normalize spaces (collapse whitespace) → DB match
   - Step 4: Static glossary exact match (`MONTESSORI_GLOSSARY_ZH`)
   - Step 5: Glossary fuzzy — base name title-cased
   - Step 6: Glossary substring — longest glossary key contained in work name (≥4 chars)
   - Also added `parent_description_zh` and `why_it_matters_zh` to the review API response for each work

2. **`lib/montree/auto-translate.ts`** — Now also translates and saves `name_zh` alongside `parent_description_zh` and `why_it_matters_zh`:
   - Checks `MONTESSORI_GLOSSARY_ZH` first (free, no API call)
   - Falls back to Haiku with 3-field JSON request
   - Backward compatible — existing callers (classroom-setup, enrich-custom-work) get the upgrade for free

3. **`app/api/montree/curriculum/batch-translate/route.ts`** — NEW endpoint `POST /api/montree/curriculum/batch-translate`:
   - Authenticated via `verifySchoolRequest()`
   - Loads all works missing `name_zh` for a classroom
   - Glossary first (free), then Haiku in batches of 5 with 500ms delays
   - Also fills missing `parent_description_zh` and `why_it_matters_zh`
   - Returns stats: `{ total, alreadyDone, translated, failed, results }`
   - 5-minute `maxDuration` for large classrooms

4. **`app/api/montree/principal/setup-stream/route.ts`** — After seeding curriculum for a new classroom, fires `batchTranslateWorksInBackground()` as fire-and-forget:
   - Queries all works with `name_zh = null`
   - Calls `autoTranslateToChinese()` in batches of 5 with 500ms delays
   - Never blocks the SSE setup stream
   - New classrooms get Chinese translations automatically

**Data migration — Whale Class 384/384 works translated:**
- Ran `scripts/batch-translate-whale.ts` (one-off TypeScript script)
- 384 works processed: ~40 via glossary, ~344 via Haiku
- 0 failures after salvage logic (regex extraction of `name_zh` from truncated JSON)
- 317/384 works now also have `parent_description_zh`
- Cost: ~$0.50 total for Haiku calls

**All 7 work creation paths audited for Chinese translation coverage:**

| Path | File | Has Translation? |
|------|------|-----------------|
| Photo audit resolve (Path B) | `photo-audit/resolve/route.ts` | ✅ via `enrichCustomWorkInBackground` → `autoTranslateToChinese` |
| Add custom work | `guru/photo-insight/add-custom-work/route.ts` | ✅ inline Sonnet translation (lines 307-342) |
| Classroom setup ("Teach AI") | `classroom-setup/route.ts` | ✅ calls `autoTranslateToChinese` directly |
| Principal setup stream | `principal/setup-stream/route.ts` | ✅ NEW — `batchTranslateWorksInBackground` |
| Principal setup (non-stream) | `principal/setup/route.ts` | ✅ NEW — `batchTranslateWorksInBackground` (same as stream version) |
| Admin reseed curriculum | `admin/reseed-curriculum/route.ts` | ❌ — admin-only recovery tool. Use batch-translate endpoint after. |
| Admin backfill curriculum | `admin/backfill-curriculum/route.ts` | ❌ — admin-only backfill. Use batch-translate endpoint after. |

The 2 admin-only paths without auto-translate are acceptable — they're recovery/maintenance tools. If used, follow up with `/api/montree/curriculum/batch-translate` to fill in Chinese names.

**Other fixes in this session (prior commits):**
- `99ceed0f` — Fix "Add Add Student" duplicate text on Students page + embedded InviteParentModal per-child (replaces broken link to Students page)
- `682a7c2f` — Fix invite banner text to reference SVG key icon instead of emoji
- `aaef12ae` — Chinese localization: add `parent_description_zh`, `why_it_matters_zh`, and `work_name_zh` to Weekly Wrap review API

**Key files changed:**
- `app/api/montree/reports/weekly-wrap/review/route.ts` — `getChineseWorkName()` 6-step fallback, `fuzzyLookup()` helper, `workNameToDescZh`/`workNameToWhyZh` maps
- `lib/montree/auto-translate.ts` — glossary check + 3-field translation (name_zh + descriptions)
- `app/api/montree/curriculum/batch-translate/route.ts` — NEW batch endpoint
- `app/api/montree/principal/setup-stream/route.ts` — `batchTranslateWorksInBackground()` + import
- `components/montree/reports/WeeklyWrapTab.tsx` — `ParentPhotosGrouped` now uses `work_name_zh`, `parent_description_zh`, `why_it_matters_zh` when locale is zh; `InviteParentModal` embedded per-child
- `app/montree/dashboard/students/page.tsx` — "Add Student" button text fix

**Next session priorities:**
1. **Test Chinese report generation end-to-end** — Generate a Weekly Wrap in Chinese locale and verify ALL work names render in Chinese
2. **Monitor Campaign D** on gmass.co/dashboard — verify 50/day throttle working, check open rates
3. **Verify dead Campaign C** (50686495) has no pending follow-ups on gmass.co/dashboard
4. **Verify Campaign A** ("Montree" pitch) draft still scheduled for Apr 27

### ⚡ Session 12 — Campaign C Empty Email Disaster + Correction Campaign D (Apr 10, 2026)

**No code commits.** Pure outreach/campaign recovery session.

**☠️ THE DISASTER — 335 BLANK EMAILS SENT:**
Session attempted to automate the GMass Campaign C send via Chrome DOM manipulation (`mcp__Claude_in_Chrome__javascript_tool`). Three cascading failures:
1. **Body insertion failed silently**: Gmail's Trusted Types security blocks `innerHTML` and `execCommand('insertHTML')`. Worked around with `createElement`/`appendChild` which rendered visually in the compose window but **DID NOT update Gmail's internal draft state**. GMass reads the internal state, not the visible DOM.
2. **Speed/throttle settings failed silently**: Set "50 emails/day" via DOM checkbox/input manipulation — also didn't persist to GMass's internal state. All 335 emails sent at once instead of 50/day.
3. **GMass send button automation**: Programmatic click on the GMass button didn't trigger GMass's extension-sandboxed event handlers. User had to click manually — but the draft was already corrupted with empty body.

**Result**: 335 emails sent with subject "Montessori Teacher & Builder" and completely empty body. ~74 bounced/blocked (54 "Address not found" from mailer-daemon + ~10 "Message blocked" + ~10 blocks). ~261 school principals received a blank email from tredoux555@gmail.com.

**Campaign C killed**: User trashed the draft → GMass detected draft in trash → stopped campaign. GMass notification confirmed campaign dead (Schedule ID 51331920, "Successful sends: 0, Emails remaining: 0"). Campaign ID: 50686495.

**Recovery — Campaign D (correction email):**
1. Created plain text correction draft via `gmail_create_draft` API with `isHtml: false` (HTML drafts via API show raw tags in Gmail compose — discovered this the hard way when first attempt showed `<p>` tags)
2. Draft ID: `r3953882681879956838`, subject "Re: Montessori Teacher & Builder", To: `345-recipients-big-42c28b38@gmass.co`
3. Body: "My apologies — it looks like my previous email was sent blank. Here's what I meant to say:" + full job application sacred email with `{SchoolName}` merge tag
4. Test email sent to self via GMass "Send Test" button — **verified good**: body intact, plain text formatting clean, montree.xyz clickable
5. GMass settings configured **manually by user** (lesson learned): 50/day speed, 5-10s pause between sends, Skip holidays ON, Skip weekends OFF (want Fri+Sat+Sun sends), Opens ON, Clicks OFF, Auto follow-ups OFF, Send as replies (threads with original blank email)
6. User firing Campaign D via red GMass button at end of session

**Bounce notifications**: 54+ "Delivery Status Notification (Failure)" emails from `mailer-daemon@googlemail.com` flooding inbox. All from Apr 10 between 04:13-04:22 PDT. Gmail API tools available are read-only + draft creation — no archive/delete/modify. User instructed to clean up manually: search `from:mailer-daemon after:2026/4/10` → select all → archive.

**Gmail API tools inventory (for future sessions):**
Available: `gmail_search_messages`, `gmail_read_message`, `gmail_read_thread`, `gmail_create_draft`, `gmail_list_drafts`, `gmail_list_labels`, `gmail_get_profile`. **NOT available**: no send, archive, delete, trash, modify, or label-apply tools. The `gmail_list_labels` description mentions `gmail_modify_thread` but that tool is not actually connected.

**🚨 HARD RULES FOR FUTURE GMASS SESSIONS:**
1. **NEVER automate Gmail compose via DOM manipulation** — body, subject, settings set via DOM do not persist to Gmail's internal state
2. **NEVER programmatically click GMass buttons** — extension runs in sandboxed context, doesn't respond to DOM-dispatched events
3. **All GMass interaction must be manual** — user opens draft, user configures GMass settings in GMass UI, user clicks GMass send button
4. **Claude's role is limited to**: creating drafts via `gmail_create_draft` API (plain text only, `isHtml: false`), searching/reading emails, and guiding the user through manual GMass steps
5. **Always test first** — use GMass "Send Test" button before any real campaign send
6. **HTML drafts via Gmail API show raw tags** — always use `isHtml: false` for drafts that will be opened in Gmail compose

**Still TODO:**
- Monitor Campaign D on gmass.co/dashboard — verify 50/day throttle is working
- Verify dead Campaign C (50686495) has no pending follow-ups
- Verify Campaign A ("Montree" pitch) draft still scheduled for Apr 27
- Clean up bounce notifications from inbox
- After Campaign D completes (~Apr 17): assess open rates and replies, decide whether the correction was sufficient or if a fresh Campaign E with new subject line is needed

### ⚡ Session 11 — Outreach Campaign Reversal + China School Sweep + Job Application Draft (Apr 10, 2026)

**No code commits.** This was a pure outreach/campaign session.

**Master spreadsheet consolidated** — `whale/Montree_Master_Outreach.xlsx` now has 770 schools total:
- Tab 1: "Global Outreach (420)" — 420 international schools with emails
- Tab 2: "China Montessori (350)" — expanded from 302 to 350 (48 new unique schools added via Baidu Maps sweep of tier-2 cities: Dalian, Harbin, Changchun, Nanning, Guiyang, Haikou, Shijiazhuang, Dongguan, Foshan, Wuxi, Nanchang, Lanzhou, Taiyuan)
- Tab 3: "Summary" — counts by city/region
- 213 China schools have phone numbers, 18 have emails

**Campaign order REVERSED:**
- **Old plan**: Campaign A (Montree pitch) first → Campaign B (job application) 5-7 days later
- **New plan**: Campaign C (job application) first → Campaign A (Montree pitch) ~2 weeks later as follow-up
- Rationale: personal "hire me" email is warmer/shorter, gets principals curious. Montree pitch lands later for non-responders as the product follow-up. No resume attached (asymmetric risk).

**New sacred job application email written** (Apr 10):
- ~70 words, AMS-certified Montessori teacher angle, mentions Montree but leads with the teacher
- Saved as `whale/docs/outreach/Letter_Job_Application.html`
- Gmail draft created via API: draft ID `r614453887712204887`, subject "Montessori Teacher & Builder", To: `345-recipients-big-42c28b38@gmass.co`

**Campaign C ready to fire** — user needs to:
1. Open draft in Gmail, configure GMass settings (50/day, Skip weekends OFF, follow-ups)
2. Click the red GMass button
3. Then postpone Campaign A draft ("Montree") from Apr 13 → Apr 27

**China phone outreach CANCELLED** — call center pricing ($700-2,800) similar to Upwork, not worth it. Sticking to email only.

### ⚡ Session 10 — Photo Audit Auto-Confirm Rails + Modal Layout + Schema Fix (Apr 8, 2026)

**Six commits pushed to main.** Closed the "why is this obvious match still in the queue" gap with two parallel rails, fixed the `mode` column schema drift, and fixed a broken bottom-sheet layout.

**Commits (in order):**
1. `6cd1956c` — Photo Audit: Gate B server auto-confirm + Tier 1 client silent-attach at ≥80% Sonnet match (via `closest_existing_match.similarity`)
2. `353bc96a` — Corrections: drop non-existent `mode` column from `montree_guru_interactions` inserts (was logging PGRST204 as "non-fatal" on every confirm/correct)
3. `83c4b00e` — ThisIsSheet: center as modal with fixed height + guard Invalid Date
4. `3894fad4` — Photo Audit: Tier 1b + Gate B also accept `proposed_name` matches

**The Paper Work bug (the crown jewel fix of this session):**
User flagged a photo card showing "AI DRAFT · 82% Paper Work · Similar to Solar System (45%)" — both Gate B and Tier 1 were bailing because they only inspected `closest_existing_match.similarity` (45%, Haiku's stale guess). But `sonnet_draft.proposed_name = "Paper Work"` at `draft.confidence = 0.82` was the real answer, and "Paper Work" IS an existing curriculum work. Nothing in the pipeline was looking at `proposed_name`.

**Fix — two rails in parallel (commit `3894fad4`):**

*Server Gate B (`app/api/montree/photo-identification/process/route.ts`)* now builds `gateBCandidates[]` with up to two entries:
1. `closest_existing_match.work_name` if `similarity >= 0.8`
2. `proposed_name` if `draft.confidence >= 0.8` AND different from the first candidate
Iterates: first candidate that resolves to a real `montree_classroom_curriculum_works` row (via `ilike` classroom-scoped query) wins. On match: updates media row with `work_id`, `identification_status='haiku_matched'`, `identification_confidence=max(draft.confidence, cand.score)`, `sonnet_draft`, `teacher_confirmed=true`, and returns early with `outcome: 'gate_b_auto_confirmed', via: 'closest_match' | 'proposed_name'`. Falls through to normal `sonnet_drafted` write on any error.

*Client Tier 1 (`app/montree/dashboard/photo-audit/page.tsx` `openThisIsSheet`)* mirrors the server: Tier 1a checks `closest_existing_match`, Tier 1b checks `proposed_name` via `findWorkByName(proposed, suggested_area)` when `draft.confidence >= 0.8`. Either hit calls `attachToExistingWork()` directly and returns without opening the sheet.

**Log lines to watch in Railway:**
- `[PhotoIdentification] GateB auto-confirm via closest_match: "X" 95% — bypassing Photo Audit`
- `[PhotoIdentification] GateB auto-confirm via proposed_name: "Paper Work" 82% — bypassing Photo Audit`
- `[ThisIsSheet] Tier 1a auto-attach: "X" 90% — skipping sheet`
- `[ThisIsSheet] Tier 1b auto-attach via proposed_name: "Paper Work" 82% — skipping sheet`

**`mode` column schema drift (commit `353bc96a`):**
Railway deploy logs were spamming `[Corrections] Confirm confidence insert error (non-fatal): { code: 'PGRST204', message: "Could not find the 'mode' column of 'montree_guru_interactions' in the schema cache" }` on every teacher confirm and correct. `app/api/montree/guru/corrections/route.ts` lines 125 and 417 were inserting `mode: 'teacher_confirmed' | 'teacher_corrected'` but the table has no such column — the scenario is already captured in `context_snapshot.scenario` JSONB. Dropped both lines. Non-fatal historically (wrapped in try/catch) but was masking real insert failures in the logs.

**ThisIsSheet layout fix (commit `83c4b00e`):**
The bottom-sheet mode (`alignItems: 'flex-end', maxHeight: '92vh'`) sized to content and on a desktop window left half the page showing behind a thin strip of sheet. Changed to:
- `alignItems: 'center', padding: 16`
- `height: 'min(720px, 90vh)'` (fixed height, not max-height)
- `borderRadius: 20` (full round, not just top)
- `background: 'rgba(0,0,0,0.7)'` backdrop (was 0.55)
- `boxShadow: '0 12px 48px rgba(0,0,0,0.35)'`
Also guarded `captured_at` rendering — was showing "Invalid Date" when null.

**Gate B threshold lowered 0.9 → 0.8 (commit `6cd1956c`):**
Original threshold was 0.9 but Sonnet confidence clusters around 0.75-0.90 on clear matches. 0.8 is the sweet spot — doesn't false-positive (tested against sandbox queue) but catches ~3x more auto-confirms.

**Audit findings (7-section health check run this session — all clean except the bugs fixed above):**
- Schema drift: only `mode` column (fixed)
- Session 7-9 consistency: all error paths safe
- TypeScript suppressions: 1 acceptable `// @ts-nocheck` on `photo-audit/resolve/route.ts` for synthetic NextRequest
- Orphaned `AcceptDraftModal` refs: zero (only in comments)
- Rate limiter on resolve route: 200/min per-IP, correct
- Migrations 164+: `164_cropped_storage_path`, `166_global_works_staging`, `167_story_message_type_document`. **Migration 165 is missing** (gap in sequence — verify intentional next session, not a dropped file)

**Carryover from earlier in session (pre-compaction, commits `6ed59ff3`, `f02ce923`, `e9e6e622`):**
- `6ed59ff3` — Fix 500 "Delegation failed" on `/api/montree/photo-audit/resolve`: replaced internal `fetch()` to sibling corrections route with in-process `correctionsPost(synthetic)` call using a synthetic `NextRequest` that forwards cookie/xff/ua headers. Railway was throwing on internal loopback fetches.
- `f02ce923` — Path B (new_custom) INSERT now seeds `parent_description`, `why_it_matters`, `key_materials` directly from cached `sonnet_draft` on `montree_media` instead of waiting for fire-and-forget Sonnet re-enrichment. New custom works appear with full Sonnet-authored descriptions the moment they hit the curriculum.
- `e9e6e622` — ThisIsSheet one-tap "Add as new work" with AI description + raised `aiGuess` match threshold to 0.75 (was false-positiving on 45% "Cutting" matches).
- `lib/montree/photo-identification/enrich-custom-work.ts` short-circuit: if curriculum row already has `parent_description` + `why_it_matters` (which it now will, thanks to `f02ce923`), skip the redundant Sonnet re-call and fire `autoTranslateToChinese` directly. Visual memory seed (step 1) still runs BEFORE the short-circuit so the self-learning corpus is populated on every new custom work.

**Next session priorities:**
1. **Verify Paper Work photos auto-confirm** — hard-refresh Photo Audit after Railway redeploy of `3894fad4`. The two "Paper Work" cards (82% proposed_name) should either disappear on single-tap "This is…" (Tier 1b) or, on a background `force=true` re-run, bypass the queue entirely via Gate B proposed_name path.
2. **Verify migration 165 gap is intentional** — `ls migrations/ | grep ^165` on the Mac repo. If a file was dropped, restore from git history.
3. **Grep Railway logs for Gate B telemetry** (24-48h after deploy) — bucket `via: closest_match` vs `via: proposed_name` vs normal Sonnet queue. If proposed_name is catching >50% of Gate B hits, consider raising its weight. If closest_match is nearly empty, Haiku's similarity field is dead weight and can be demoted.
4. **Phase 2 Gate A threshold tune from Session 7 telemetry** — still pending. Grep Railway logs for `[PhotoIdentification] GateA` and bucket outcome by haikuConf / hasVM / vmSetSize.

### ⚡ Session 9 — Story Login Log Self-Heal (Apr 8, 2026)

**Commit `ec626171` pushed to main.** Fix for "Z's logins don't show up in admin dashboard every time."

**Root cause:** Story user browser POSTs `/api/story/auth` once per JWT lifetime (24h) to get a token, then replays it via Authorization header on every page load + heartbeat. The only code path writing to `story_login_logs` was that single POST. Two ways it silently dropped rows:
1. `/api/story/auth` rate limiter was 5/15min keyed by IP — a household/school sharing one public WAN IP (Tredoux testing + Z + any other users) eats the bucket and Z's real login returns 429, no row.
2. `logLogin()` insert errors only `console.error` and the POST still returns 200 OK — frontend saves token, user is "logged in," admin sees nothing.

**Fix — heartbeat self-heal (`app/api/story/heartbeat/route.ts`):** Heartbeat already fires every few seconds while a user is on the site. Added an idempotent check: query `story_login_logs` for a row with current `session_token` (50-char truncation). If none, INSERT one with username + ip + user_agent + login_at=now. Every distinct session produces exactly one login row regardless of whether the original POST wrote one. Wrapped in try/catch, never fails the heartbeat.

**Fix — rate limit relaxed (`app/api/story/auth/route.ts`):** Bumped `/api/story/auth` from 5/15min → 30/15min per IP. Shared home/school WAN IPs no longer lock legitimate users out.

**Not touched (intentionally):**
- Admin side (`/api/story/admin/auth`) — user said "mine don't matter"
- Silent `logLogin()` error swallowing — heartbeat self-heal recovers from this for free
- `story_login_logs` schema — no new columns needed

**Next session (if still seeing gaps):** Check Railway logs for `[Heartbeat] Self-healed login log` to confirm the path is firing, and `[Heartbeat] Self-heal login log insert failed` to catch any schema surprises.

### ⚡ Session 8 — "This is..." Unified Photo Audit Flow (Apr 8, 2026)

**Commit `8d8ead0a` pushed to main.** Streamlined the Photo Audit resolution flow: Fix + Accept + AcceptDraftModal collapsed into a single "This is..." bottom sheet with three resolution paths (existing / new_custom / confirm_ai). Every photo becomes one question with one answer. All three paths end the same way (`teacher_confirmed=true`, photo leaves queue) — eliminates the Session 7 ghost-Fix two-step shuffle.

**New files:**
- `lib/montree/hooks/useClassroomWorks.ts` — extracted from WorkWheelPicker's lazy-load, reusable classroom works hook with AbortController cleanup
- `components/montree/photo-audit/ThisIsSheet.tsx` — full-screen bottom sheet, three handlers (`handlePickExisting`, `handleConfirmAI`, `handleCreateNew`), AI guess derived from `current_work_id` → `closest_existing_match` fallback, pre-seeds `newWorkArea` from `sonnet_draft.suggested_area`, exact-match dedup check prevents duplicate custom works
- `app/api/montree/photo-audit/resolve/route.ts` — POST handler, rate limited 200/min, delegates Paths A/C to `/api/montree/guru/corrections` via internal fetch with cookie forwarding, Path B inlines minimal `montree_classroom_curriculum_works` insert (dedup via ilike, 23505 handler, atomic media UPDATE `work_id + teacher_confirmed`, orphan-work rollback on media failure), fires `enrichCustomWorkInBackground` fire-and-forget
- `lib/montree/photo-identification/enrich-custom-work.ts` — background Sonnet enrichment, reads cached `sonnet_draft.visual_description` from `montree_media` (free rich fingerprint), seeds `montree_visual_memory` with `source='teacher_new_work' confidence=1.0`, calls Sonnet for rich `parent_description` + `why_it_matters` + `key_materials`, updates `montree_classroom_curriculum_works`, fires `autoTranslateToChinese` for zh locale

**Removed:**
- `components/montree/photo-audit/AcceptDraftModal.tsx` — obsolete
- `openAcceptModal` three-tier router (logic now split between resolve route + sheet)
- `handleAcceptDraftSave` (replaced by unified `handleResolvePhoto`)
- `acceptingPhoto` state

**Wiring in `app/montree/dashboard/photo-audit/page.tsx`:** swapped `AcceptDraftModal` import for `ThisIsSheet`, added `thisIsPhoto` state, added `handleResolvePhoto(photo, resolution)` that POSTs to `/api/montree/photo-audit/resolve`, rewired Sonnet-draft card "Accept" button → `openThisIsSheet`, replaced modal JSX block with `<ThisIsSheet>`.

**Schema note:** Path B uses existing columns — no migrations needed. Resolve route relies on the `(classroom_id, work_name)` unique constraint added in Session 6.

**Known carryover (not touched this session):**
- Session 7 Gate A telemetry still needs real-world bucketing from Railway logs before Phase 2 threshold tune.
- Legacy Fix flow (`correctingPhoto` + `handleWorkSelected`) left intact for non-sonnet-draft cards — it's orthogonal to the new sheet and unused on AI Draft cards.

**Apr 8 rerun on existing audit queue:** Added `force: true` flag to `/api/montree/photo-identification/process` (gates idempotency early-return, clears `identification_status` + `sonnet_draft` before rerunning). Drove a fire-and-forget background loop from user's authed Chrome tab (batches of 3, 1s delay) across all photos in the Whale Class queue. **Result: 36/36 ok, 0 errors.** Every queued photo now has a fresh draft from the Session 7 Phase 1 visual-memory gate + Session 8 corpus. User should hard-refresh Photo Audit to pick up new drafts and the new "This is..." sheet UI.

**Next session priorities:**
1. Grep Railway logs for `GateA` telemetry, tune `HAIKU_TRUST_CONFIDENCE`, ship Phase 2
2. Verify "This is..." sheet on live Whale Class with real photos (all three paths)
3. Consider folding the legacy Fix flow into ThisIsSheet for non-sonnet cards

### ⚡ Session 7 — Photo Audit Phase 1: Ghost Queue Fix + Gate A Telemetry (Apr 8, 2026)

**Commit `7f27cc71` pushed to main.** Three targeted fixes to the photo audit pipeline after a live audit of the Whale Class review queue (45 photos, only 2/47 hitting the silent auto-tag path).

**Ghost-queue bug fixed (`app/api/montree/guru/corrections/route.ts`):**
Previously only the CONFIRM branch (`action: 'confirm'`) set `teacher_confirmed=true` on the media row. The CORRECTION branch — used by the Tier 1 silent-attach router at `photo-audit/page.tsx` `attachToExistingWork()` — did not. Result: photos accepted via the three-tier Accept router disappeared from the UI via `setPhotos(prev => prev.filter(...))` but reappeared on refresh because `teacher_confirmed` stayed false/null. This was flagged as a known issue in Session 6 notes but not fixed until now. One-shot cleanup SQL run in Supabase editor by user: `UPDATE montree_media SET teacher_confirmed=true WHERE work_id IS NOT NULL AND identification_status='sonnet_drafted' AND (teacher_confirmed IS NULL OR teacher_confirmed=false);` — returned 0 rows (the API's work_id was enriched from a join, not the raw media row).

**Visual memory gate relaxed (`lib/montree/photo-identification/context-loader.ts`):**
Two changes that were silently starving Gate A:
1. `.limit(30)` → `.limit(100)` on the `montree_visual_memory` query. Whale Class has 53 described works — the old cap was dropping 23 of them from `visualMemoryWorkNames`, so `hasVisualMemoryFor()` returned false for any photo matching one of the lower-ranked works.
2. Filter was `source IN ('teacher_setup','correction') AND description_confidence >= 0.9`. Changed to include `'teacher_enrichment'` (the source that classroom-setup writes) and dropped the bar to `>= 0.75`. The "Cutting" row in Whale Class is an example: `source='teacher_enrichment', description_confidence=0.8`, previously excluded entirely from the trust gate.

**Gate A telemetry (`app/api/montree/photo-identification/process/route.ts`):**
Added a structured log line before the Haiku trust decision:
```
console.log('[PhotoIdentification] GateA ' + JSON.stringify({
  mediaId, haikuSuccess, haikuConf, haikuWork, hasVM,
  vmSetSize, vmInjected, threshold, outcome
}));
```
24–48h of Railway logs will give the real distribution of Haiku confidence + hasVM hits so `HAIKU_TRUST_CONFIDENCE` can be tuned from data in Phase 2 instead of guessing. **Next session: grep Railway logs for `[PhotoIdentification] GateA`, count outcome='trusted' vs 'sonnet_fallback', bucket by haikuConf and hasVM, then tune the threshold and ship Phase 2.**

**Key architectural correction to CLAUDE.md Session 6 notes:**
The `sonnet_draft` JSONB column on `montree_media` is populated by a **separate background pipeline** at `app/api/montree/photo-identification/process/route.ts` — NOT by the Guru photo-insight route. Every photo gets fired at this route on capture (fire-and-forget with `keepalive: true`), runs two-pass Haiku, and either (a) writes `identification_status='haiku_matched'` with `work_id` set silently if Gate A passes, or (b) calls `generateSonnetDraft()` from `lib/montree/photo-identification/sonnet-draft.ts` and stores the result in `sonnet_draft` with `identification_status='sonnet_drafted'`. The Photo Audit "Needs Review" queue filters on `teacher_confirmed != true` (NOT on identification_status), which is why the ghost-queue bug was hiding. Gate A conditions: `success && confidence>=0.75 && hasVisualMemoryForMatch && resolveClassroomWorkId() succeeds`. ALL four must be true to auto-tag.

**Live numbers from Whale Class at audit time:**
- 47 photos in queue, identification_status breakdown: `sonnet_drafted: 42, haiku_matched: 2, skipped: 3`.
- Auto-tag rate **4%** — expected ~40%+ after Phase 1 visual memory relaxation and Phase 2 threshold tune.
- Of 29 sonnet_drafted rows inspected: **~22 were wasted Sonnet runs** (proposed_name == closest_existing_match, similarity ≥85%) and **~7 were legitimate** "propose a new variant" cases (e.g. "Ocean Animal Object Matching" closest to "Object to Picture Matching" 82%).
- 15 of 47 had `work_id` set while still in status `sonnet_drafted` — those are ghosts from the correction-branch bug.

**Cost: $0.02 per photo for the 42 sonnet_drafted today. ~$0.84/day at current volume. Phase 1+2 should drop this ~50%.**

**Known quandary surfaced Apr 8 (NOT YET FIXED — next session, see deep dive below):**
User reports: took a photo, Sonnet drafted as "Touch Tablets (Rough and Smooth)", clicked Fix and changed to "Baric Tablets". The work_id/work_name on the photo row updates, BUT `sonnet_draft.proposed_name` and `closest_existing_match` are left stale. Result:
1. The AI DRAFT card on the grid still shows the old Sonnet-proposed name + old similar-to line.
2. Clicking Accept reads `photo.sonnet_draft.proposed_name` (via `openAcceptModal`), so the modal offers "Use Touch Tablets (Rough and Smooth)" — not the Fix'd value.
3. Even when Phase 1 ships `teacher_confirmed=true` server-side, Fix is deliberately client-state-only per the comment at `page.tsx:1067` ("update work info but keep photo in place for further actions"). Fix does NOT remove the photo from the queue, so the user is trapped in a two-step Fix-then-something shuffle.

Root cause (three layers):
- **A.** The Fix flow calls `/api/montree/guru/corrections` (CORRECTION path) which writes the correction + work_id + now teacher_confirmed, but the client-side state update only patches work_id/work_name/area on the photo object — it leaves `sonnet_draft` untouched. Simplest local fix: after a successful Fix, either clear `sonnet_draft` from the photo state, OR remove the photo from the grid (matching the silent-attach router behavior).
- **B.** Fix is currently designed as "soft update that keeps the photo in the queue for further action" which is the wrong mental model. The teacher is telling us the ground truth — there's nothing left to do. Mental-model fix: Fix = I'm telling you the answer = photo leaves the queue. No second Accept step.
- **C.** The user's second request: when a photo is a brand-new custom work the AI has never seen ("Baric Tablets" doesn't exist in curriculum), the teacher wants to TYPE the correct name and have Sonnet re-run the rich draft generation seeded with that name, then approve/reject the re-draft. This flow doesn't exist yet. Needs a new endpoint `POST /api/montree/photo-identification/redraft` that takes `media_id` + `teacher_provided_name` and calls `generateSonnetDraft()` with the teacher name as a high-confidence anchor in the prompt.

**Proposed unified flow (see Session 7 deep dive in handoff below):**
One button per card: "This is..." → modal with three paths:
- **Path A — existing curriculum match:** autocomplete picker → attach + teacher_confirmed + visual memory append → photo leaves queue.
- **Path B — new custom work:** type name → Sonnet redraft → teacher reviews/approves → custom work row + visual memory + attach → photo leaves queue.
- **Path C — AI draft is correct:** the current Accept button (three-tier router), unchanged.

All three paths end the same way: `teacher_confirmed=true`, photo leaves queue, no two-step shuffle. Fix as a standalone action gets removed or redefined to be identical to Path A.

**Next session priorities (in order):**
1. **Grep Railway logs for `GateA`** — bucket outcomes by haikuConf, hasVM, vmSetSize. Tune HAIKU_TRUST_CONFIDENCE from real data. Ship Phase 2.
2. **Fix the Fix bug** — at minimum, after a successful Fix correction, remove the photo from the grid (one line: `setPhotos(prev => prev.filter(p => p.id !== correctingPhoto.id))`) and drop the misleading "keep photo in place" comment. Short term band-aid before the bigger UX redesign.
3. **Build the unified "This is..." modal** — collapse Fix + Accept + Teach-the-AI into one three-path modal. Bigger refactor but much cleaner mental model.
4. **Build the `/photo-identification/redraft` endpoint** — POST `{media_id, teacher_provided_name}`, calls `generateSonnetDraft()` with a modified prompt anchoring on the teacher name, returns the new draft for review. Then the Path B flow in the unified modal can surface it.

## RECENT STATUS (Apr 7, 2026)

### ⚡ Session 6 — Self-Learning Loop Complete + Three-Tier Accept Router (Apr 7, 2026)

**Three-tier Accept router for photo audit — ✅ PUSHED (commit `97c9d151`):**
Replaced confusing 4-button row (Add as new / Attach / Fix / Correct / Teach) with simplified 2-button "✅ Accept" + "✏️ Fix" on AI Draft cards. Accept button now routes through three tiers based on `closest_existing_match` similarity:
- **Tier 1 (≥90%)**: Silently attaches photo to existing curriculum work via `/api/montree/guru/corrections` — no modal, no clicks
- **Tier 2 (50-89%)**: Opens AcceptDraftModal with blue "🔗 Use 'WorkName'" as primary button, small "+ Add as new work anyway" link below
- **Tier 3 (<50%)**: Opens AcceptDraftModal with violet "✨ Add to Curriculum" as primary
- **Key files**: `app/montree/dashboard/photo-audit/page.tsx` (`findWorkByName`, `attachToExistingWork`, `openAcceptModal` three-tier router, lines 852-950), `components/montree/photo-audit/AcceptDraftModal.tsx` (`existingMatch` + `onUseExisting` props)
- **Pre-existing 500 fix in same session** (commit `12ef1671`): `app/api/montree/guru/photo-insight/add-custom-work/route.ts` was inserting `area_key` directly but the table uses `area_id` (UUID FK) — same root cause as Session 4 weekly-admin bug. Added area_key→area_id resolution + sequence computation + materials as array + parent_description/why_it_matters/is_active in insert payload.

**WorkWheelPicker cross-area search — ✅ PUSHED (commit `ab7d7f13`):**
Search bar now searches ALL curriculum areas, not just the open one. Lazy-loads `globalWorks` on first non-empty search via `/api/montree/curriculum?classroom_id=X`. Renders flat list with area badges when search is active.

**🧠 SELF-LEARNING LOOP COMPLETE — ✅ PUSHED (3 commits: `b54ef5e4`, `13cf25ff`, `256b6a6a`, `3923914c`):**

The crown jewel. Per-classroom self-improving brain that gets measurably smarter every day from teacher Fix corrections. All hidden behind the scenes — no UI changes, the corpus lives entirely in `montree_visual_memory` (server-side moat).

**Loop 1 — Write the corpus (`app/api/montree/guru/corrections/route.ts`)**:
When a teacher Fixes a photo from work A → work B, the new `enrichVisualMemoryFromCorrection()` function:
1. Reads cached `sonnet_draft.visual_description` from `montree_media` (rich + free) — falls back to fresh Haiku call only if no draft cached. `descriptionSource: 'sonnet_draft' | 'haiku_fresh'` tracked.
2. **APPENDS** (not overwrites) the fingerprint to work B's `visual_description` column via `appendVisualFingerprint()` — multi-fingerprint accumulation with `||` separator, capped at 2500 chars with FIFO eviction. Idempotent: skips if first 80 chars already present.
3. **APPENDS** a negative example (`"Looks similar to {B} — features: ..."`) to work A's `negative_descriptions[]` array via `appendNegativeExample()` — capped at 8 with FIFO. Idempotent on first 60 chars. Skips entirely if work A has no positive entry yet (would inject `LOOKS LIKE: (no fingerprint)` garbage into Pass 2).
4. Source = `'correction'`, confidence = `0.95`. `invalidateClassroomEmbeddings(classroomId)` called after upsert.
- **Key functions**: `enrichVisualMemoryFromCorrection`, `appendVisualFingerprint`, `appendNegativeExample` (all in corrections route)
- **Legacy `generateAndStoreVisualMemory` kept** for first_capture path

**Loop 2 — Read the corpus (`app/api/montree/guru/photo-insight/route.ts` ~line 798-918)**:
ALREADY IN PLACE from prior session. Pass 2 (Haiku) loads up to 30 visual memory entries per request, filters to teacher-validated sources (`teacher_setup` confidence 1.0 OR `correction` confidence ≥0.9, OR any `is_custom=true`), and renders them at TOP of Pass 2 prompt as `LOOKS LIKE: ... / KEY MATERIALS: ... / DISTINGUISH FROM: ...` blocks. As Loop 1 grows the corpus, Pass 2 sees richer descriptions every day.

**Loop 3 — Sonnet discriminator on hard cases (`app/api/montree/guru/photo-insight/route.ts` line 1656-1791)**:
NEW. Inserted between Pass 2 success block and the existing Sonnet single-pass fallback. Gated on:
- `!haiku_only` (skip in diagnostic mode)
- `input && matchResult` (Pass 2 succeeded, mutually exclusive with single-pass fallback at line 1795 which gates on `!input || !matchResult`)
- `matchResult.candidates.length >= 2`
- `matchScore < 0.7 OR input.confidence < 0.5`
- At least 1 of top 3 candidates has visual memory (otherwise nothing to discriminate against — logs `Pass 3 skipped — no top candidates have visual memory yet`)

When fired, loads visual memory for top 3 candidates, builds `[A]/[B]/[C]` blocks with `LOOKS LIKE / KEY MATERIALS / NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH`, calls Sonnet (`AI_MODEL`) via tool_use (`pick_work` tool with `choice: A|B|C|none`, `confidence`, `reasoning`). If Sonnet picks at confidence ≥0.6, replaces `finalWorkName/Area/Key`, bumps `matchScore` to `Math.max(matchScore, 0.85)`, sets `modelUsed = AI_MODEL`, mutates `input.confidence = max(input.confidence, out.confidence)` so downstream gates accept the result.
- **Dynamic timeout** (commit `3923914c` audit fix): Was fixed 30s, blew the 45s `ROUTE_TIMEOUT_MS` budget when Pass 1+2 already ran ~15s. Now uses `Math.min(ROUTE_TIMEOUT_MS - elapsed - 3000, 25000)` — same pattern as the existing Sonnet fallback at line 1320.
- **Cost curve**: Easy photos still flow Haiku-only at $0.006. Hard photos pay ~$0.02. As corpus grows, Pass 2 confidence climbs above the 0.7 gate, fewer photos hit Pass 3 — system gets cheaper AND more accurate over time.

**SQL run by user in Supabase editor (Apr 7)**:
```sql
ALTER TABLE montree_media ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS cropped_storage_path TEXT;  -- migration 164
ALTER TABLE montree_visual_memory
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS negative_descriptions TEXT[],
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS key_materials TEXT[],
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS description_confidence NUMERIC,
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS source TEXT,
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS source_media_id UUID,
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS photo_url TEXT,
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW();
-- Plus unique constraint on (classroom_id, work_name) and idx on (classroom_id, description_confidence DESC, updated_at DESC)
```
Baseline showed Whale Class works already had `desc_chars=1000`, `negative_count=3`, `source=teacher_setup` from existing Teach the AI corpus — Loop 1 now appends to these existing rows.

**Watch in Railway logs**:
- `[VisualMemory] Enriched "X" via sonnet_draft + negative on "Y"` — Loop 1 firing
- `[PhotoInsight] Pass 3 budget: Xms (Yms elapsed)` — Loop 3 entering
- `[PhotoInsight] Pass 3 discriminator (Xms): "OldGuess" → "BetterGuess" (conf 0.85) — reasoning...` — Loop 3 saving a hard call
- `[PhotoInsight] Pass 3 skipped — no top candidates have visual memory yet` — should appear LESS over time as corpus fills

**Architectural decisions**:
- The moat lives in `montree_visual_memory`. NO UI exposes it. No "AI brain" page. No "learned descriptions" admin view. Competitors screen-recording the app see a clean Montessori tracker; the intelligence is invisible.
- Negatives only accumulate on works with at least one positive fingerprint (avoids stub-row pollution of Pass 2).
- Loop 1 mutates `input.confidence` in-memory only — no cross-request leakage.
- Pass 3 and the legacy single-pass Sonnet fallback are mutually exclusive by gate condition.

**Photo audit "stale Sonnet draft" issue — KNOWN, not yet fixed**:
After teacher Fixes a photo (correctly re-tagging it), the photo can still appear in Photo Review with an "Accept AI Draft" button because `sonnet_draft` is cached on `montree_media` and Fix doesn't clear it. When teacher clicks Accept, the modal reads the stale `closest_existing_match` from the cached draft and offers a now-irrelevant suggestion. Two fixes to ship next session:
1. After Fix correction in `attachToExistingWork`, the photo SHOULD already be removed from the audit grid via `setPhotos(prev => prev.filter(p => p.id !== photo.id))` — but verify it's also persisted as `teacher_confirmed=true` so it doesn't reappear on refresh.
2. In `openAcceptModal`, if `photo.work_id` is already set (teacher already decided), ignore `closest_existing_match` from the cached Sonnet draft and treat as Tier 3 directly.

### ⚡ Session 5 — Story Fixes, Flag Dedup, Crop Preservation (Apr 6-7, 2026)

**Story system fixes — ✅ PUSHED:**
- Video uploads: Added `uploadWithRetry()` with exponential backoff for ECONNRESET/ETIMEDOUT, Node `--max-old-space-size=2048` in `start.sh`, better MIME handling for mobile (empty MIME → extension fallback), better error messages
- Login records: Merged user + admin login logs in `/api/story/admin/login-logs/route.ts` with `role` field. `logLogin()` now verifies insert. Online user window expanded 2→5min.
- Admin send: `validateFile()` fixed for mobile videos with empty MIME type. Session linking fields made conditional (retry without if columns don't exist in production).
- Rate limiter: DB-backed, 5 attempts per 15 minutes per IP per endpoint (`montree_rate_limit_logs`).

**Flag deduplication in Weekly Wrap — ✅ PUSHED (commit `54a3257c`):**
Red flags now suppress yellow flags for same curriculum area. Client-side dedup: extracts area keywords from red flag text, filters yellow flags that mention same areas.
- **Key file**: `components/montree/reports/WeeklyWrapTab.tsx` — flag rendering IIFE (~line 844)

**Persistent work/photo removal — ✅ PUSHED (commit `54a3257c`):**
`handleRemoveWork` and `handleRemovePhoto` in WeeklyWrapTab now call edit API (`/api/montree/reports/weekly-wrap/edit`) to persist deletions to DB. Previously was client-state only — removals vanished on page reload. Edit API now supports `works[]` field alongside `narrative` and `photos`.

**Photo crop preservation — ✅ PUSHED (commit `cb82fb15`):**
Crop API (`/api/montree/media/crop`) was overwriting original photos with `upsert: true`. Now saves cropped version to new path (`original_cropped_timestamp.jpg`) keeping originals intact. Migration 164 adds `cropped_storage_path` column to `montree_media`. Callers (weekly-wrap, gallery) updated to use `cropped_url` from API response. Graceful fallback if column doesn't exist yet.
- **⚠️ Migration 164 needs manual run** via Supabase SQL editor: `ALTER TABLE montree_media ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS cropped_storage_path TEXT;`
- **Key file**: `app/api/montree/media/crop/route.ts`

**What STILL NEEDS FIXING (next session):**
1. **Run migration 164** via Supabase SQL editor (cropped_storage_path column)
2. **Verify Weekly Admin auto-fill on production** — Click Auto-fill on week 2026-03-30
3. **"999 days" in observations** — Red flags say "No work in 999 days" for areas with no baseline data
4. **Teacher summary line still shows English work names** — The "需要关注" section needs Chinese work names
5. **Test new prompts end-to-end** — Verify parent narratives (200-300 words) and teacher key_insight (2-3 sentences)

### ⚡ Session 4 — Weekly Admin Auto-fill Root Cause Fix + Dictionary 6-per-page (Apr 6, 2026)

**Weekly Admin auto-fill area-grouped format — ✅ FINALLY FIXED (10+ iterations across sessions 3-4):**
Root cause was `area_key` column doesn't exist on `montree_classroom_curriculum_works` — that table uses `area_id` (UUID). Supabase queries with nonexistent columns return `{ data: null }` silently, so the `workNameToArea` map was completely empty (0 entries), causing ALL works to fall into "Other" bucket or produce "No recorded activities."
- **The fix** (commit `193eca37`): Changed 3 queries from `area_key` to `area_id`, then resolve via `areaIdToKey.get(w.area_id)`. Confirmed: 384 works now map correctly.
- **Tier 3 fallback restored** (commit `09c5ffb4`): When no Weekly Wrap or photo data exists, `parseSavedText()` re-parses existing flat "did X, Y, Z" notes into area-grouped format. This ensures clicking Auto-fill always reformats old flat notes.
- **Flash-and-vanish bug**: Area-grouped text briefly appeared then vanished — likely caused by `fetchData` re-running and reloading flat-format saved notes from DB, overwriting the fresh auto-fill state. The parseSavedText tier 3 fix addresses this from the API side (even stale DB text gets reformatted).
- **Auto-fill guard**: Auto-fills on page load ONLY when no saved notes exist. Manual Auto-fill button click always runs and overwrites current state.
- **Debug fields removed** (commit `09c5ffb4`): `_v` and `_debug` removed from API response.
- **Key file**: `app/api/montree/weekly-admin-docs/auto-fill/route.ts`
- **Critical lesson**: `montree_classroom_curriculum_works` has `area_id` (UUID FK), NOT `area_key`. Always resolve via `areaIdToKey` map from `montree_classroom_curriculum_areas`.

**Dictionary 6 words per page — ✅ PUSHED (commit `dc684834`):**
Card dimensions tightened: picture 52→46px, trace/write 52→46px, fonts shrunk proportionally, margins reduced (8mm→5mm header). wordsPerPage: A4 normal+write `5→6`, A4 no-write `6→7`, A5 `4→5`. Only CMAT group needed for now — others added week by week.
- **Key file**: `public/tools/my-first-dictionary.html`

**Total commits this session** (7 pushed to main):
- `dc684834` — Dictionary 6 words/page + initial auto-fill fixes
- `193eca37` — area_key → area_id fix (THE critical fix)
- `8ba39374` — Debug info in API response (temporary)
- `3162e097` — Merge all data sources
- `abef0c0f` — Simplify to Weekly Wrap + photos only
- `0e1868f4` — Revert client-side flat format auto-detection
- `09c5ffb4` — Restore parseSavedText tier 3 + remove debug fields

**What STILL NEEDS FIXING (next session):**
1. **Verify Weekly Admin auto-fill on production** — Click Auto-fill on week 2026-03-30 after Railway deploys commit `09c5ffb4`. API confirmed working via console; UI verification pending.
2. **Verify dictionary 6-per-page on production** — Print preview CMAT group, confirm 6 cards fit per A4 page.
3. **"999 days" in observations** — Red flags say "No work in 999 days" for areas with no baseline data.
4. **Teacher summary line still shows English work names** — The "需要关注" section shows English work names with Chinese area labels. Review API needs Chinese work names for teacher summary.
5. **Test new prompts end-to-end** — Generate reports and verify: parent narratives are rich/educational (200-300 words), teacher key_insight is concise/actionable (2-3 sentences).

---

### ⚡ Session 3 Fixes — Parent Reports, Weekly Admin Format, Dictionary (Apr 6, 2026)

**Parent Reports area grouping — ✅ PUSHED:**
Photos in Parent Reports tab (WeeklyWrapTab.tsx) now grouped by curriculum area in shelf order (`practical_life → sensorial → mathematics → language → cultural → other`). New `ParentPhotosGrouped` component renders area headers with colored pills, groups photos using `toCanonicalArea()`. Replaces flat photo list.
- **Key file**: `components/montree/reports/WeeklyWrapTab.tsx` — `ParentPhotosGrouped` component (~lines 137-252)

**Weekly Admin summary area-grouped format — ✅ PUSHED (after 7+ iterations):**
Weekly Summary in Weekly Admin Docs now displays works grouped by area (`Practical Life: X, Y\nSensorial: Z`) instead of flat paragraphs. See Session 4 above for the full root cause fix.
- **Key files**: `app/api/montree/weekly-admin-docs/auto-fill/route.ts` (three-tier fallback + `parseSavedText()` dual-format parser), `components/montree/reports/WeeklyAdminTab.tsx` (auto-fill trigger guard)
- **Pattern — `parseSavedText(text)`**: Detects whether text is already area-grouped (has "Practical Life:" lines) or flat paragraph ("did X, Y, and Z"), parses work names, looks up curriculum areas, returns `Map<area_key, work_names[]>`. Always check format before parsing.

**Dictionary two-row card layout — ✅ PUSHED (2 commits: `c1f7da6d` + `7df8629a`):**
Word cards changed from single flex-row (`[picture][word][trace][write]`) to two-row stacked card:
- Top row (`.word-card-top`): picture + written word side by side
- Bottom row (`.word-card-bottom`): trace word (flex:1) left + free write (flex:1) right
- Both `makeWordRow()` (standard) and `makeTwoColCard()` (two-column) use this layout
- CSS layout overrides (compact, spacious, A5) target both `.word-row` and `.word-card`
- **Key file**: `public/tools/my-first-dictionary.html`

**Dictionary custom-only mode — ✅ PUSHED:**
New "Custom words only" checkbox. Auto-checked on Photo Bank import. Filters to only show words with `imgData` (imported/uploaded). Empty state shows "No custom words yet" placeholder with instructions.

### ⚡ Photo Audit + Weekly Wrap MERGED (Apr 6, 2026)

**Merged Photo Audit + Weekly Wrap into one page** — Weekly Wrap is now a tab inside Photo Audit (`/montree/dashboard/photo-audit`). Three tabs: Needs Review → Confirmed → Weekly Wrap. Teachers audit photos first, then do weekly wrap in the same page.

**Dashboard nav reduced to 3 icons**: Capture (📸), Notes (📝), Photo Audit (🔍). Weekly Wrap icon (📋) removed from header — accessed via Photo Audit tab instead.

**New component**: `components/montree/reports/WeeklyWrapTab.tsx` — self-contained Weekly Wrap embedded in Photo Audit:
- **Teacher Review**: Compact 2-3 column grid of child cards. Yellow highlight if flagged. Click expands inline with work chips (× delete), flags, recommendations.
- **Parent Reports**: Continuous scroll — all children expanded with narrative + horizontal photo row. No accordion. Teacher can scan whole class, edit narratives, delete photos.
- Week ◀ ▶ navigation, Select mode with Select All, Generate/Regenerate with streaming, Send All to Parents.

**Weekly Wrap page** (`/montree/dashboard/weekly-wrap`) still exists as standalone for direct URL access. WeeklyWrapTab is the simplified embedded version.

### 3x3x3x3x3 Development System

Standard development methodology for complex tasks:
1. **3x PLAN** — Map all tasks, dependencies, and scope
2. **3x THEORIZE** — Research best approach, explore code, consider architecture
3. **3x INVESTIGATE** — Deep audit of all code paths, data flow, wiring points
4. **3x BUILD** — Build with audit cycles (build → audit → build → audit)
5. **3x AUDIT** — Final verification: type safety, logic, JSX, data flow, edge cases

Each phase runs 3 rounds of its activity. Parallel agents used where possible. Every build phase includes inline auditing. Final audit catches remaining bugs before push.

### ⚡ PRIORITY: Full Chinese Localization + Teacher Report JSON Repair

**Chinese Localization — ✅ COMPLETE (Session 14, Apr 11, 2026):**
Full bilingual pipeline. When UI is set to Chinese, area labels, work names, photo descriptions, parent narratives, detail content, and flag badges all display in Chinese. English when in English.

**🚨 DUAL-COLUMN ROOT CAUSE (Session 14 — the persistent English-in-Chinese bug):**
DB has TWO Chinese name columns: `name_chinese` (migration 099, **read by UI**) and `name_zh` (migration 149, **written by auto-translate**). All previous sessions wrote `name_zh` but the UI checks `name_chinese`. Session 14 fixed ALL 7 write paths to write BOTH columns, synced the DB (384 rows), and fixed ALL UI components to check locale. See Session 14 notes for full details.

**✅ SWITCHED TO SONNET + TOOL_USE (commit `760d7c4c`):**
Haiku's Chinese JSON corruption issue is permanently solved by two changes:
1. **Switched to Sonnet** (`AI_MODEL`) for both teacher reports and parent narratives. Higher quality, reliable JSON.
2. **Teacher reports use `tool_use` structured output** — the API handles JSON serialization, so the model never produces raw JSON text. This eliminates all JSON corruption issues (unescaped quotes, fullwidth punctuation, literal newlines) regardless of model or language.
3. **Selective child generation** — teachers can now pick specific children to generate/regenerate reports for instead of all 19 at once. This controls Sonnet costs (~$0.09/child vs $1.70 for all 19).
- Cost with Sonnet: ~$0.09 per child (teacher + parent). Full class run: ~$1.70. Selective generation makes this manageable.
- MAX_CONCURRENT reduced from 5 to 3 for Sonnet rate limit safety.

**✅ NOW ON SONNET** — Both `teacher-report-generator.ts` and `narrative-generator.ts` import `AI_MODEL` (Sonnet). Teacher report uses `tool_use` for structured output.

**What was FIXED this session (Chinese localization):**
1. ~~**UUID areas in Weekly Admin Docs auto-fill**~~ — ✅ FIXED. Auto-fill API now has `resolveArea()` with UUID→canonical key mapping. Was causing summary to show "..." placeholder (no data matched canonical area keys).
2. ~~**Weekly Admin Docs plan showing English work names**~~ — ✅ FIXED. API returns `planAreasZh` alongside `planAreas`. Page uses `chinese_text` when locale is zh. DOCX generation also locale-aware.
3. ~~**Photo descriptions under parent reports in English**~~ — ✅ FIXED (earlier commit). Static Chinese descriptions file + DB `parent_description_zh`/`why_it_matters_zh` columns + fuzzy matching.
4. ~~**Visual memory overwriting Chinese descriptions**~~ — ✅ FIXED. Guard: `if (locale === 'zh' && dbDescriptions.has(vmKey)) continue;`
5. ~~**Missing Chinese descriptions for 20+ works**~~ — ✅ FIXED. Added to `parent-descriptions-zh.ts`.
6. ~~**Classroom variant names not matching**~~ — ✅ FIXED. Fuzzy matching (strip " - suffix", normalize spaces) in 4 files.
7. **Auto-translate for new "Teach the AI" descriptions** — ✅ NEW. `lib/montree/auto-translate.ts` fire-and-forgets Haiku translation to Chinese after every Sonnet description generation. Stored in `name_zh`/`parent_description_zh`/`why_it_matters_zh`. **Session 13 upgrade**: now also translates `name_zh` (glossary first, then Haiku). All 384 Whale Class works have `name_zh` populated.
8. **Batch-translate endpoint** — ✅ NEW (Session 13). `POST /api/montree/curriculum/batch-translate` translates all works missing `name_zh` in a classroom. Glossary first, then Haiku in batches of 5.
9. **Principal setup auto-translate** — ✅ NEW (Session 13). `principal/setup-stream/route.ts` fires `batchTranslateWorksInBackground()` after seeding curriculum. New classrooms get Chinese translations automatically.
10. **Dual-column sync** — ✅ FIXED (Session 14). ALL 7 write paths now write both `name_zh` AND `name_chinese`. DB synced. See Session 14 handoff.
11. **All UI components** — ✅ FIXED (Session 14). WorkWheelPicker (4 locations), AreaSpinnerWheel, ThisIsSheet, DuplicateSheet, CurriculumWorkList expanded view (`parent_description_zh`, `why_it_matters_zh`).
12. **Progress API DB fallback** — ✅ FIXED (Session 14). Child dashboard focus works now fetch DB `name_chinese` as fallback for works not in static JSON (custom works).
13. **Curriculum seed API** — ✅ FIXED (Session 14). POST seed action now includes `name_chinese` + `name_zh` from static JSON `chineseName`.

**What was FIXED (next session = session 3):**
1. ~~**Teacher report quality**~~ — ✅ FIXED (Apr 6 session 2). Content quality was "swapped" — both prompts rewritten.
2. ~~**Parent Reports flat photo list**~~ — ✅ FIXED (Apr 6 session 3). Photos now grouped by curriculum area.
3. ~~**Weekly Admin flat format**~~ — ✅ FIXED (Apr 6 session 3). Three-tier fallback with `parseSavedText()`.
**Still open** — see Session 3 "STILL NEEDS FIXING" above.

**What WORKS end-to-end (tested Apr 5):**
- ✅ Weekly Wrap generation (streaming, all 19 children)
- ✅ Review page loads all children with reports
- ✅ Parent narratives generate beautifully (warm, paragraph style)
- ✅ "19 parent reports ready to send" + Send All button appears
- ✅ No duplicate key errors (migration 162)
- ✅ No column errors (enrolled_at, no duration_minutes/repetition_count)
- ✅ UUID areas resolved to canonical keys (practical_life, sensorial, etc.)
- ✅ Full Chinese localization (area labels, work names, recommendation sentences)
- ✅ Clean work names (AI prefixes "Present/Continue" stripped by `cleanWorkName()`)
- ✅ Interactive "Next Week's Focus" shelf with WorkWheelPicker, P/P/M status badges
- ✅ Generate/Regenerate button in review page header with streaming progress
- ✅ Invite Parents link in sticky bottom bar (links to Manage Students)

**Still untested:**
- Send to parents (email dispatch)
- Weekly Admin auto-fill from Weekly Wrap data
- Weekly Admin DOCX generation
- Switching back to Sonnet for production quality

**Key Discovery — `montree_weekly_reports` schema:**
Table has MORE columns than originally documented. Full column list: `id, child_id, classroom_id, school_id, week_start, week_end, week_number (NOT NULL), report_year (NOT NULL), report_type, status, content, is_published, published_at, sent_at, generated_at, created_at, updated_at, created_by, concentration_score, area_distribution, areas_of_growth, highlights, parent_summary, recommendations, recommended_works, active_sensitive_periods`. The `week_number` and `report_year` columns are NOT NULL — removing them from upserts causes silent insert failures. Always include computed `weekNumber` and `reportYear` in upserts. Queries should use `.eq('week_start', weekStart)` (canonical identifier).

**Key Files:**
- `app/api/montree/reports/weekly-wrap/route.ts` — main generation (streaming + non-streaming). Loads `montree_classroom_curriculum_areas` to build `areaIdToKey` map; resolves UUID areas at generation time.
- `app/api/montree/reports/weekly-wrap/review/route.ts` — GET review data. Has `resolveArea()`, `cleanWorkName()`, `getChineseWorkName()`, `cleanUUIDs()`. Pipes `work_zh`, `area_label_zh` through all response fields.
- `app/api/montree/reports/weekly-wrap/send/route.ts` — POST publish + email
- `app/montree/dashboard/weekly-wrap/page.tsx` — review UI client (~1500 lines). Two tabs: Teacher Summary (with interactive shelf, WorkWheelPicker, approve/push) + Parent Reports (edit narrative, reorder photos, crop, send). **Selective generation**: "Select" mode lets teachers pick specific children to regenerate. Generate/Regenerate All button in header with streaming progress bar. Invite Parents link in bottom bar.
- `components/montree/reports/WeeklyWrapCard.tsx` — dashboard card (NO LONGER used on dashboard — removed from Teacher Tools. Still exists as component for potential reuse.)
- `lib/montree/reports/teacher-report-generator.ts` — **SONNET** teacher report (max_tokens: 8192). Uses `tool_use` structured output — API handles JSON serialization (no raw JSON from model). Has `repairAndParseJSON()` as legacy fallback. System prompt in English even for Chinese output. `key_insight` field prompt rewritten (Apr 6) to produce concise 2-3 sentence actionable summary (status + shelf actions), not Montessori essays.
- `lib/montree/reports/narrative-generator.ts` — **SONNET** parent narrative (max_tokens: 800, was 300). Prompt rewritten (Apr 6) from "3-5 sentence intro under 100 words" to rich 200-300 word personal letter: opening moment → learning story with educational context per work → bigger developmental picture → warm close. Uses `parent_description` and `why_it_matters` data from photos. Template fallback also enriched.
- `app/api/montree/weekly-admin-docs/auto-fill/route.ts` — pulls from weekly_reports. Has `resolveArea()` for UUID→canonical key mapping. Returns `planAreasZh` alongside `planAreas`. Has `getZhWorkName()` for fuzzy Chinese name lookup.
- `app/api/montree/weekly-admin-docs/generate/route.ts` — DOCX generation. Locale-aware: uses `chinese_text` for plan area work names when locale is zh.
- `lib/montree/weekly-admin/doc-generator.ts` — DOCX builder (multilineParagraphs splits on \n)
- `lib/montree/auto-translate.ts` — **NEW**. Fire-and-forget Haiku translation of Sonnet-generated descriptions to Chinese. Called after "Teach the AI" saves. Stores in `parent_description_zh`/`why_it_matters_zh` on `montree_classroom_curriculum_works`.
- `lib/curriculum/comprehensive-guides/parent-descriptions-zh.ts` — Static Chinese parent descriptions (~130 works). Has `getChineseParentDescription()` with fuzzy matching (strip suffix, space-collapsed). `getChineseDescriptionsMap()` for batch lookups.

**Key Technical Patterns (Weekly Wrap):**
- `cleanWorkName(raw)` — strips AI prefixes ("Present/Continue/Introduce") and trailing clauses ("as the.../with increased..."), with substring matching against known curriculum works. Used in both review API and `FocusWorksSection.tsx`.
- `resolveArea(raw, workName?)` — 3-layer resolution: UUID lookup via `areaIdToKey` map → canonical key check → fuzzy keyword matching → work-name-based area fallback. **Must be added to any new API that reads Weekly Wrap data** — parent reports store areas as UUIDs.
- `toCanonicalArea(raw)` — client-side area normalization using `normalizeArea()` from AreaBadge + fuzzy keyword matching.
- Chinese localization: `AREA_LABELS_ZH` map + `name_zh` from `montree_classroom_curriculum_works` table + `getAreaLabel(area)` helper using locale.
- `repairAndParseJSON(raw)` — robust JSON repair for Haiku Chinese output. Strategy: strip fences → extract braces → replace ALL newlines with spaces → fix fullwidth punctuation → fix structural commas. The newline→space replacement is the key insight: literal newlines in JSON are only valid as whitespace between tokens, never inside strings.
- **Fuzzy work name matching** (used in 4+ files): strip " - suffix" variants → normalize spaces ("chalk board" → "chalkboard") → substring match for long keys. Pattern: `name.replace(/\s*-\s*.+$/, '').trim()` then `collapsed.replace(/\s+/g, '')`.
- **Photo crop preservation**: Crop API saves to new path (`_cropped_{timestamp}` suffix), stores in `montree_media.cropped_storage_path`. Original `storage_path` never modified. Callers use `cropped_url` from API response. Parent reports always reference original `storage_path`.

---

**Content Quality Swap Fix — ✅ PUSHED (Apr 6 session 2):**
Parent narrative and teacher key_insight prompts were producing content for the wrong audience. Teacher `key_insight` was writing rich Montessori developmental essays (perfect for parents), while parent `narrative` was writing casual 3-5 sentence summaries (more like teacher notes). Fixed by rewriting both prompts:
- **`narrative-generator.ts`**: Prompt expanded from "3-5 sentence intro under 100 words" to a structured 200-300 word personal letter (opening moment → learning story explaining 2-3 works with WHY they matter → developmental arc → warm close). max_tokens 300→800. Now uses `parent_description` and `why_it_matters` photo data that was available but underutilized. Voice: "teacher talking to parent over coffee." Template fallback also enriched with educational context.
- **`teacher-report-generator.ts`**: `key_insight` field prompt rewritten from "3-5 sentence synthesis essay" to "2-3 sentence consultant sticky note" — quick status read (on track/needs attention/thriving) + specific shelf action items naming exact works. Detailed analysis stays in structured fields (`area_analyses`, `sensitive_periods`, etc.). Tool_use schema description also updated.
- **WeeklyWrapTab.tsx**: (From earlier in this session) Added interactive shelf to Teacher Review, redesigned Parent Reports with large vertical photos + educational context per photo, added guru observation card, fixed AbortController cleanup, fixed `await getSession()` on sync function.

**Full Chinese Localization + JSON Repair — ✅ PUSHED (commits from Apr 5-6 session):**
Multi-commit session for full bilingual Chinese/English support:
- Chinese parent descriptions: 20+ missing works added to `parent-descriptions-zh.ts`, fuzzy matching in `getChineseParentDescription()` and `getChineseWorkName()`
- Visual memory overwrite fix: Chinese descriptions no longer overwritten by English visual memory entries
- Fuzzy work name matching: 4 files updated with strip-suffix + space-collapsed matching
- Auto-translate: new `lib/montree/auto-translate.ts` for fire-and-forget Haiku translation after "Teach the AI"
- Weekly Admin Docs Chinese: `resolveArea()` for UUID areas, `planAreasZh` in API, locale-aware PlanCard + DOCX generation
- Teacher report JSON repair: `repairAndParseJSON()` with nuclear newline→space approach + rewritten system prompt
- Weekly Wrap UI: flag badges, sent/edited badges, photo work names, shelf names all localized

**Weekly Wrap UI Polish — ✅ PUSHED (commits `aaee0d8f` → `e077e68d`):**
6 commits in this session:
1. `aaee0d8f` — Fix UUID areas in weekly wrap + add shelf work picker (WorkWheelPicker integration, `areaIdToKey` map in generation route and review API)
2. `cab4052b` — Full Chinese localization for Weekly Wrap + clean work names (`cleanWorkName()`, `resolveArea()`, `AREA_LABELS_ZH`, `work_zh`/`area_label_zh` fields, 顿号 separators)
3. `d40c65ff` — Rectangular pill badges + `cleanWorkName()` in FocusWorksSection (child week view badges changed from round circles to pills matching Weekly Wrap aesthetic)
4. `dfcc4208` — Remove old Parent Report block from gallery page (replaced with minimal "Invite Parent" text link)
5. `d5d97465` — Generate button in Weekly Wrap header + Weekly Plan & Summary moved to three-dots dropdown menu + WeeklyWrapCard removed from Teacher Tools
6. `e077e68d` — Invite Parents link added to Weekly Wrap sticky bottom bar (left of Send All button)

**Gallery Chronological Order + Photo Audit Sort — ✅ PUSHED (commit `9f9bff3e`):**
Gallery "All Photos" now renders chronologically with date headers (was area-grouped). Timeline tab and Tag Event tab removed (redundant). Area filter chips retained. Photo Audit API sort changed from `created_at` to `captured_at` for consistency.

**Smart Capture Tappable Work Name — ✅ PUSHED (commit `4c736971`):**
PhotoInsightPopup work name row is now a tappable button with pencil icon → opens WorkWheelPicker inline on capture page. "Wrong? Fix →" removed. "Just Save" centered. Full correction flow (area picker → work picker → PATCH → popup reappears) works without leaving capture screen.

**Corrections Map Override + Scenario A Fix — ✅ PUSHED (commit `e7277f24`):**
Visual memory now overrides stale corrections map entries at runtime (fuzzyScore >= 0.5). E.g., "Chalkboard Writing" → "Chalk Board Writing - No lines" instead of → "Name Writing". Pass 2 prompt gets CLASSROOM-VERIFIED PRIORITY rule. Scenario A threshold changed to trust high matchScores (>=0.90) even with moderate Haiku confidence.

**Haiku Classification Fix — Visual Memory Feedback Loop — ✅ PUSHED (commit `cf039f04`):**
Fixed critical data flow break: teacher "Teach the AI" descriptions (Sonnet-quality, confidence 1.0, with key_materials + negative_descriptions) were stored in `montree_visual_memory` but NEVER injected into Haiku identification prompts because `is_custom=false` filter discarded them. 4 changes: (1) Pass 1 reordered — HANDS & PRIMARY WORK now item #1, accessories labeled as secondary. (2) Query expanded — loads key_materials, negative_descriptions, source, description_confidence. (3) Filter replaced — `is_custom OR (source IN teacher_setup/correction AND confidence>=0.9)` instead of just `is_custom`. (4) Visual memory moved to TOP of Pass 2 prompt with rich format (KEY MATERIALS, DISTINGUISH FROM) instead of buried at bottom of 280-line guide.

**Haiku Batch Speed-Up — ✅ PUSHED (same session, commit before cf039f04):**
Photo Audit Haiku batch processing: 3 photos in parallel (was 1 sequential), 500ms delay between batches (was 3000ms per photo). ~47 photos now ~20 seconds instead of ~2.7 minutes.

**Dual P/P/M System + Auto-Presented — ✅ PUSHED (same session):**
Photo Audit seeds P/P/M statuses from DB with "practicing" default. Fire-and-forget persists defaults with `no_downgrade: true`. Multi-child group photos auto-mark all children as "presented" silently (no UI clutter). Progress update API has `no_downgrade` param with STATUS_RANK guard. Case-insensitive progressMap keying fixed.

**Haiku Test Tab + Feature Gates + Upload Limits — ✅ PUSHED + MIGRATED (commit `3b4e1423`, migration 161):**
Photo Audit: new 🧪 Haiku Test diagnostic tab — runs two-pass Haiku without Sonnet fallback, shows Pass 1 (visual description) + Pass 2 (match result). Fixed `visualDescription` block-scoping bug. Weekly Admin Docs feature-gated (dashboard card, page, 5 API routes) — toggleable per-school via super-admin ⚙️. Migration 161 enables for Whale Class. Story video uploads bumped 100→300MB, timeouts 180→300s across all 4 paths.

**Feature-Gated Dashboard — ✅ PUSHED + MIGRATED (commit `039b435d`, migration 160):**
Dashboard sections (Daily Brief, Intelligence, Teacher Tools, Shelf Autopilot, Paperwork Tracker) gated by existing feature flag system. New schools see clean minimal view. Whale Class has everything enabled. Super-admin ⚙️ gear button per school opens feature toggle modal. Features POST route now accepts super-admin auth.

**Story Mobile Video Uploads Fixed — ✅ PUSHED (commit `6bcd3f46`):**
5 root causes fixed: server timeouts too short (60s/120s → 300s), missing iOS MIME types (3gpp, 3gpp2, x-m4v), no AbortController on admin uploads (infinite hang), unsafe `res.json()` on 502 HTML responses, client timeout too short (90s → 180s).

**Guru Progressive Thinking Display — ✅ PUSHED (commit `06f4d337`):**
Shows "Thinking..." → "Building context..." (3s) → "Generating response..." (8s) instead of static dots. Disappears once SSE streaming starts.

**Guru Model String + Error Messages — ✅ PUSHED (commit `e53a8299`):**
Model updated from `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` → `claude-sonnet-4-6`. Error responses now expose actual API error text. Photo audit "Correct" now permanent via `teacher_confirmed` boolean on `montree_media`.

**Paperwork Tracker Panel — ✅ PUSHED (commit `101896b8`):**
New dashboard intelligence panel. Tracks which weekly paperwork packet (weeks 1-37) each child is on.

**Circle Time Cards Merged — ✅ PUSHED (commit `b68a7c4c`):**
Separate Circle Time tab removed. Now "Calling Card Size" dropdown (4×4 duplex / 2×2 circle time) in all 3 Picture Bingo modes.

## KEY ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS

- **CLIP/SigLIP — PERMANENTLY REMOVED (Apr 4, 2026).** Stub files remain for type exports only. All functions are no-ops. Production uses Haiku two-pass exclusively.
- **Smart Capture** uses two-pass describe-then-match: Pass 1 (Haiku + image) describes what's seen, Pass 2 (Haiku + text) matches to curriculum. Sonnet fallback if both fail.
- **Photo identification cost:** ~$0.006/photo via Haiku two-pass pipeline.
- **Per-classroom visual memory** self-learning system (THE MOAT — Session 6 completed all 3 loops): three paths feed `montree_visual_memory`:
  - (1) "Teach the AI" button uses Sonnet to generate 5-field descriptions (visual_description, parent_description, why_it_matters, key_materials, negative_descriptions) stored with source='teacher_setup', confidence=1.0.
  - (2) "Fix" corrections (Loop 1) now APPEND a rich fingerprint via `enrichVisualMemoryFromCorrection()` in `corrections/route.ts` — prefers cached `sonnet_draft.visual_description` from `montree_media` (free, rich), falls back to fresh Haiku call. Multi-fingerprint accumulation in `visual_description` column with `||` separator, capped 2500 chars FIFO. Source='correction', confidence=0.95. ALSO appends a negative example to the original (wrong) work's `negative_descriptions[]` array.
  - (3) Auto-generated onboarding/first_capture descriptions (confidence=0.8) are NOT injected into Pass 2 — they caused bias reinforcement.
- **Pass 2** loads up to 30 entries, filters to teacher-validated (`teacher_setup` ≥1.0 OR `correction` ≥0.9 OR `is_custom=true`), renders LOOKS LIKE / KEY MATERIALS / DISTINGUISH FROM blocks at TOP of prompt.
- **Pass 3** (Loop 3, Session 6) — Sonnet discriminator on low-confidence Pass 2 results (`matchScore < 0.7 OR input.confidence < 0.5`, requires ≥2 candidates with at least 1 having visual memory). Top 3 candidates rendered as A/B/C blocks with visual memory, Sonnet picks via tool_use. Cost ramps DOWN over time as corpus grows.
- **Hidden moat**: NO UI exposes the corpus. Competitors copying the app see a clean Montessori tracker; the intelligence is invisible and grows in slow motion from real classroom use.
- **Guru** uses Sonnet for all users (teachers + parents). Haiku for daily coach features. Self-improving brain system grows from every conversation.
- **All client-facing photo URLs** use Cloudflare-cached proxy (`getProxyUrl()`). Server-to-server URLs use direct Supabase.
- **Cross-pollination security:** Every route accepting `child_id` MUST call `verifyChildBelongsToSchool()`. No exceptions.
- **i18n:** 1,490+ keys, perfect EN/ZH parity. Custom React Context system (`useI18n()` hook).
- **Feature flags:** `montree_feature_definitions` + `montree_school_features` + `montree_classroom_features`. `FeaturesProvider` context in dashboard layout. `useFeatures()` hook with `isEnabled(key)`. Fail-closed (all off if fetch fails). Dashboard sections gated: `daily_brief`, `intelligence_panels`, `teacher_tools`, `shelf_autopilot`, `paperwork_tracker`, `weekly_admin_docs`. New schools get clean minimal view. Super-admin ⚙️ button per school to toggle.

## Authentication

7 auth systems. Teacher/principal tokens use httpOnly cookies.

| System | How | Used By |
|--------|-----|---------|
| Teacher login | 6-char code (SHA256) or email+bcrypt → httpOnly cookie (`montree-auth`) | `/api/montree/auth/teacher` |
| Principal login | Code or email+bcrypt → httpOnly cookie (`montree-auth`) | `/api/montree/principal/login` |
| Parent access | Invite code → cookie (`montree_parent_session`) | `/api/montree/parent/auth/access-code` |
| Admin JWT | `jose` library, `ADMIN_SECRET`, httpOnly cookie (`admin-token`) | `lib/auth.ts` |
| Super admin | Password (timing-safe compare) + JWT session tokens | `lib/verify-super-admin.ts` |
| Story auth | Separate JWT system | `lib/story-auth.ts` |
| Multi-auth | Another separate system | `lib/auth-multi.ts` |

**Montree auth flow:** Login → JWT → httpOnly cookie `montree-auth` → `verifySchoolRequest()` reads cookie → extracts userId, schoolId, classroomId, role. Client `montreeApi()` relies on cookie auto-sending.

**Key auth files:** `lib/montree/server-auth.ts`, `lib/montree/verify-request.ts`, `lib/montree/api.ts`

---

## Supabase Client (Consolidated)

Single client: `lib/supabase-client.ts` — singleton with retry logic.
- `getSupabase()` — service role (server-side, bypasses RLS)
- `createSupabaseClient()` — anon key (browser-side)
- Also exports: `getPublicUrl()`, `getSupabaseUrl()`, storage bucket constants

---

## Curriculum System

5 area JSON files in `lib/curriculum/data/`: `language.json` (43 works), `practical_life.json`, `sensorial.json`, `mathematics.json`, `cultural.json`. Total: 329 works.

---

## Guru System (AI Teacher Advisor)

**Core files:**
- `lib/montree/guru/conversational-prompt.ts` — persona builder (teacher=violet, parent=botanical green)
- `lib/montree/guru/context-builder.ts` — child context
- `lib/montree/guru/tool-definitions.ts` — 12 teacher tools + `getToolsForMode()`
- `lib/montree/guru/tool-executor.ts` — tool execution handlers
- `lib/montree/guru/question-classifier.ts` — regex classifier for selective knowledge injection
- `lib/montree/guru/brain.ts` — self-improving brain (extraction, consolidation, retrieval)
- `lib/montree/guru/skill-graph.ts` — V3 skill-exercise mapping, bridge detection, attention flags
- `app/api/montree/guru/route.ts` — main chat endpoint
- `app/api/montree/guru/photo-insight/route.ts` — Smart Capture (two-pass Haiku)
- `app/api/montree/guru/corrections/route.ts` — teacher corrections
- `components/montree/guru/GuruChatThread.tsx` — shared chat UI

**Principal Admin Guru:** `lib/montree/admin/guru-*.ts` — 12 school-scoped tools, SSE streaming.
**Super-Admin Guru:** `lib/montree/super-admin/guru-prompt.ts` — 15 tools across all schools.

---

## Report & Photo System

```
Teacher Preview → Select Photos → montree_report_media junction table
Publish → send/route.ts queries junction → Creates final report
Parent View → parent/report/[id]/route.ts queries junction
```

Description matching uses area-constrained whole-word matching. Custom works (`work_key` starts with `custom_`) don't auto-match.

---

## Dashboard Intelligence Layer (Teacher OS)

5 panels below student grid: Attendance, Stale Works, Conference Notes, Evidence, Pulse. Daily Brief panel above grid with priority-ranked action items. All powered by `/api/montree/intelligence/daily-brief`.

---

## Local Development

```bash
cd ~/whale
npm run dev
# Access at http://localhost:3000
```

Both local and production connect to the SAME Supabase database.

---

## Important Patterns

- **`.single()` → `.maybeSingle()`** — Always use `.maybeSingle()` for queries that might return 0 rows. `.single()` throws on 0 rows.
- **`.ilike()` SQL injection** — Escape `%`, `_`, `\` before any `.ilike()` call: `.replace(/[%_\\]/g, '\\$&')`
- **JSON-before-OK** — Always check `response.ok` BEFORE calling `response.json()`. Server may return HTML error pages.
- **Fire-and-forget `.catch()`** — Always add `.catch(err => console.error(...))` — never empty `.catch(() => {})`.
- **Supabase `.rpc()` has no `.catch()`** — Use `.then(({ error }) => ...)` instead.
- **`montree_guru_interactions` uses `asked_at`** not `created_at` as its timestamp column.
- **AbortController cleanup** — All `useEffect` fetches should have AbortController + cleanup on unmount.

## Migrations Run (production)

All migrations through 169 have been run. Key ones: 147 (smart learning columns), 148 (classroom onboarding), 152-154 (teacher OS foundation), 155 (teacher OS foundation DDL), 156 (visitor tracking), 157 (teacher notes child_id), 158 (paperwork_current_week), 159 (teacher_confirmed media), 160 (dashboard feature gates + Whale Class enabled), 161 (enable weekly_admin_docs for Whale Class), 164 (cropped_storage_path on montree_media — run Apr 7 via Supabase SQL editor), 169 (guide_content_zh JSONB on montree_classroom_curriculum_works — run Apr 11). **Migration 166 (`montree_global_works_staging`) still pending** from prior session. The Apr 7 self-learning loop SQL also added safety-net columns to `montree_visual_memory` (negative_descriptions, key_materials, description_confidence, source, source_media_id, photo_url, updated_at) — all `IF NOT EXISTS`, idempotent. **Apr 12**: `story_message_history.is_from_admin BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE` added via Supabase SQL Editor (migration `20260118_story_session_linking.sql` was in git but never run).
