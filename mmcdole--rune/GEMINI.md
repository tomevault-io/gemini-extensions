# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Build and Test

```bash
go build ./cmd/rune/    # build
go test ./...           # tests
```

## Architecture

Rune is a MUD client: Go is the kernel (I/O, memory, concurrency), Lua is user space (logic, features, presentation). A single Orchestrator goroutine (the Session) owns the Lua state and processes all events sequentially via channels — thread safety through message passing, not mutexes.

**`docs/architecture.md` is the canonical architecture doc** (system overview, push-model UI, picker, directory structure). Read it before structural changes.

### Event Flow

```
User Submission -> UI input chan -> Session -> rune.hooks.call("input", text, {mode}) -> network
Server Line -> net output   -> Session -> rune.hooks.call("output") -> UI print
Server Prompt -> net output -> Session -> rune.hooks.call("prompt") -> UI prompt overlay
Timer fire -> timer events  -> Session -> rune.timer._fire(id)
Key bind -> UI outbound     -> Session -> rune.binds._dispatch(key)
Bar tick (250ms)            -> Session -> rune.bars._render_all(width) -> UI bars
```

### Go/Lua Boundary Conventions

These rules keep the boundary consistent; follow them when adding APIs:

- **Go registers only `rune._*` primitives** (`_send_raw`, `_timer`, `_input`, `_ui`, ...). Every public name (`rune.send`, `rune.input.get`, `rune.ui.bar`, ...) is defined in Lua, even when the wrapper is thin. The Lua core in `lua/core/` IS the public API surface (loaded in numeric order; each file's header comment states its charter). The only non-underscore fields Go sets are `rune.config_dir` and `rune.version` (data, not API; version is single-sourced from the `version` package so TTYPE/MNES cannot drift from `/version`).
- **Registries live in Lua** on the shared factory (`rune.registry.new`, `15_registry.lua`). Hooks, timers, aliases, triggers, binds, bars, and slash commands all get handles, upsert-by-name, groups, priorities, source attribution, and failure quarantine from one implementation. Go dispatches through internal entry points (`rune.hooks.call`, `rune.binds._dispatch`, `rune.bars._render_all`, `rune.timer._fire`). Dispatch loops that keep iterating after a user callback runs iterate `Registry:snapshot()`, so callbacks may add/remove entries mid-dispatch safely.
- **Presentation belongs to Lua** via `rune.style` (`05_style.lua`). Even the local-echo styling (`"> "` prefix) is a Lua handler on the `"echo"` hook. Go colors only its last-resort degraded-path messages, through `text.Red`/`text.Green` - raw escape codes live in exactly one file per language.
- **Key policy**: Go owns atomic bracketed paste, `Ctrl+Enter`/`Ctrl+J` newline insertion, Enter-to-submit, and editing/cancel keys while a UI-internal mode is active (picker or lossless composer). The ordinary one-line view stays unchanged and has no mode chrome. Application actions remain Lua binds; the composer delegates unhandled chords such as `Ctrl+E`. In normal input, bound printable keys fire only when the input is empty; Go's scroll-key handler is a fallback for unbound keys (keeps degraded mode scrollable).
- **Error convention**: Go primitives return `nil, err` for recoverable failures (send while disconnected, missing file, bad pattern); raising is reserved for programmer errors (wrong argument types).

### Script Robustness

- **Watchdog**: every Go→Lua entry runs under `Engine.guard` with a deadline (`Engine.CallTimeout`, default 5s). Runaway scripts are interrupted with an error; the VM stays usable. Nested entries share the outermost deadline. Host calls that legitimately block on the user (e.g. `open_editor` running `$EDITOR`) run under `Engine.pauseWatchdog`, which detaches the deadline and re-arms a fresh one.
- **Handler isolation**: `rune.hooks.call` runs each handler under `pcall`; a throwing handler is reported and skipped, not allowed to abort the chain.
- **Failure quarantine**: `rune.guarded_call(label, data, fn, ...)` tracks consecutive failures on a registry entry and disables it after 3 in a row. Used by hooks, triggers, aliases, timers, binds, bar renderers, and slash commands. Commands are quarantined individually (`rune.command.dispatch`), so a broken user command can never disable the core input hook.
- **Degraded mode**: if `rune.hooks.call` is unavailable (core script failed, or a user script clobbered `rune.hooks`), the client degrades to a plain telnet client instead of crashing - output passes through raw, input goes to the server, and `/quit` + `/reload` still work.
- **Source attribution**: registrations record the registering script's `file:line` (`rune.caller_source`); it appears in error messages and the `/hooks`, `/triggers`, `/aliases`, `/timers`, `/binds`, `/bars` listings.
- **Engine-level failures** route through `Engine.reportError` → the Lua `"error"` event, with a re-entrancy guard that falls back to direct printing.

### Hook Event Semantics

Data-flow: `"output"`, `"prompt"`, `"echo"` support returning `false` to gag or a string to rewrite (rewrites CHAIN to subsequent handlers; the core `"echo"` handler adds the `"> "` styling). Every `"input"` handler receives `(text, context)` exactly once per submission, with read-only `context.mode` always `"command"` or `"verbatim"`; verbatim `text` may contain LF. Input supports only `false` (consume) - string returns are ignored, and the core input handler at priority 100 always consumes, so custom input handlers must register below 100.

## Lua API

Full reference: `website/src/content/docs/reference/api/` (one page per namespace; published at runemud.com/reference/api/). It is mechanically complete: a new public `rune.*` function must be added there or `lua/api_docs_coverage_test.go` fails. Go primitives (`rune._*`) are internal. Slash commands are registry-based; `/help` is generated from the registry.

User scripts auto-load from `<config-dir>/init.lua` at startup. The default is
`~/.config/rune`; `--config-dir` overrides `RUNE_CONFIG_DIR`, which overrides
the platform default.

## Testing

**`docs/testing.md` is the canonical decision guide** - read it before adding tests. The skeleton: (1) test at the lowest layer that can express the failure (Go unit → Lua layer against MockHost → session synchronous → e2e scenario JSON → e2e imperative Go); (2) table-driven Go everywhere in-process, JSON only at the e2e scenario layer and only within the existing step vocabulary. When a bug is reported, FIRST add a failing `test/e2e/scenarios/regressions/` scenario, then fix.

## Telnet Notes

The default compatibility table advertises ONLY implemented options: Echo, SGA, EOR, TTYPE/MTTS, NAWS, CHARSET, NEW-ENVIRON/MNES (identity responders in `network/negotiate.go` - pure functions, byte-exact tests), MCCP2 (zlib read path in client.go; the source is a byte-exact `bufio.Reader`, so a clean stream end resumes plain telnet), and GMCP (option 201; framing in Go, policy in `70_gmcp.lua`). Never `Support()` an option without implementing its behavior - agreeing to an option without honoring its subnegotiations breaks real servers (MCCP3, MSSP, ZMP, Linemode stay refused). All socket writes go through the connection's single writeLoop. The parser accepts subnegotiations for options enabled on either side (server-offered GMCP/MCCP are remote; client-answered TTYPE/NAWS are local).

## Releasing

Versions come from git tags: `git tag vX.Y.Z && git push --tags` runs the release workflow (goreleaser), which builds linux/darwin/windows binaries and stamps `version.Number` via ldflags. The in-repo default (`X.Y.Z-dev`) marks untagged builds.
