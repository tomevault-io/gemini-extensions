# Agent notes — DevCake

Instructions for coding agents (Claude, Cursor, Grok, Codex, etc.) working in this repo.
These rules are **mandatory** unless the user explicitly overrides them for a task.

For setting up or operating a deployment, read the agent-neutral
[`skills/devcake-ops/SKILL.md`](skills/devcake-ops/SKILL.md). It explains the
product, configuration, diagnostics, and recovery workflow for an operator's helper.

## Security / product claims

The **product security contract** is [`docs/14-security.md`](docs/14-security.md).
Do not write docs, README, or PR copy that claims a stronger posture (multi-tenant
sandbox, secrets never leave the host under injection, hard-gated branch
protection) than that file. Do not treat staffing a different Dev Type for
REVIEW as a security control — the security-relevant second identity is the
**reviewer token** (app-only); REVIEW is always a pipeline stage. Design choices
(dedicated host, adult-operator prompt trust, warnings vs gates) are intentional.

## Admin SPA design system (mandatory)

Any change under `admin/spa/` that affects look, feel, copy, or interaction
**must follow [`admin/spa/DESIGN.md`](admin/spa/DESIGN.md)** — the decided
design guideline (identity, tokens, layout idioms, action hierarchy, dialogs,
copy voice, evidence loop). Read it before touching the SPA. Iron rules:

- Colors come from the `@theme` tokens in `admin/spa/src/index.css` — never raw
  hex or new color families in components. `accent-*` is the only brand accent.
- Scalar settings are `SettingRow`s; record lists are real tables styled like
  the Runs table; Fleet (`#/fleet/<section>`) and Settings (`#/settings/<section>`)
  each render one section per view (Limits carries the merged Limits + Traffic
  cards); Repositories, PMO, and Skill sources are draft-editing pages under
  the sidebar's Connections item — not Fleet/Settings sections.
- One primary action per header/card; secondary/rare/destructive actions go in
  a `MoreMenu` (⋯) with honest one-line consequence descriptions — but never a
  one-item menu when it's the element's only action.
- Native `window.confirm/prompt/alert` are banned — use `Modal.jsx` dialogs.
- Draft semantics are untouchable: config edits ride `useConfigDraft`; anything
  immediate is wrapped in `InstantZone`.

## Always Works™ (mandatory before done)

**"Should work" ≠ "does work."** Before marking any change complete, prove it with evidence you personally observed — not assumptions.

| Change type | Minimum proof |
|---|---|
| Docker / Bake / Compose | `docker buildx bake …` succeeds **and** `docker compose up -d` + healthchecks pass |
| App / API | **`./scripts/pytest_app.sh`** (always rebuilds `app-test` via Bake or Dockerfile `--target test`, then pytest), **or** `docker buildx bake app-test` then pytest in that image, **or** `PYTHONPATH=app` on Python **3.12** against the working tree; **and** bake/restart prod `app` when the run path changed |
| Admin SPA | `bake admin` **and** load UI / nginx-health |
| Dev harness / entrypoint | `bake images` (or affected target) **and** smoke CLI + import entrypoint |
| Docs-only | No runtime required; still re-read for accuracy |

**Stale `app-test` trap:** the `devcake/app-test` image **COPY**s `app/devcake` and `app/tests` at bake time. Re-running pytest on an old `devcake/app-test:latest` grades the last bake, not your working tree — a silent false green. Always rebake after `app/` edits, or use `PYTHONPATH=app` on 3.12, or `./scripts/pytest_app.sh` (always rebuilds first via `scripts/lib/bake_app_test.sh`: Docker Buildx bake when available, else `docker build -f app/Dockerfile --target test`). CI rebakes on every run; local agent loops often forget.

Never claim done from "build succeeded" alone when the user-facing path is run/up. Name anything still unproven.

## Engineering standards (mandatory for new work)

### TDD for new implementations

**New behavior is test-first.** Do not implement production code for a new feature, bug fix with a known reproduction, or new module until a failing test exists.

| Rule | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Red → green → (then ship)** | Write a failing test that names the behavior; write the minimum code to pass; only then refactor. |
| **Vertical slices** | One seam / one behavior at a time. Do **not** bulk-write a suite of imagined tests then implement everything. |
| **Agree the seam first** | Before the first test: state the public interface under test (function, port Protocol, HTTP path). Tests hit that seam only. |
| **No private tests** | Do not assert on private helpers, call counts of internal collaborators, or implementation structure. Prefer fakes at **port** seams (`ports/*`). |
| **Independent expected values** | Assertions use known literals / domain rules — not recomputing the same algorithm as production. |
| **Where tests live** | `app/tests/test_*.py`. Run with Python **3.12** (prod image). Prefer `./scripts/pytest_app.sh` (rebakes `app-test` then pytest), or `PYTHONPATH=app` locally on 3.12. |
| **When TDD does not apply** | Pure renames, docs-only, config/copy, or mechanical follow-the-existing-pattern refactors with no behavior change — still run existing tests (Always Works™). |

### SOLID (always)

Design and refactors must respect SOLID. Prefer **deep modules** (small interface, large behavior) over shallow pass-through wrappers. Domain vocabulary: see `docs/01-architecture.md` and `docs/02-domain-model.md`. Architecture terms for structure: **module, interface, implementation, depth, seam, adapter, leverage, locality** (not “service/API/boundary” as design words).

| Principle | In this codebase |
|---|---|
| **S** — Single responsibility | One reason to change per module. Dispatch spine → `RunBootstrap`; mission transitions → orchestrator; vendor HTTP → adapters. |
| **O** — Open/closed | Extend via new adapters / new callers of a deep module; do not fork copy-paste spines. |
| **L** — Liskov | Port adapters are substitutable (prod + test fakes). Fakes must honor the Protocol contract. |
| **I** — Interface segregation | Prefer focused Protocols (`ports/*`) over god objects callers only use 10% of. |
| **D** — Dependency inversion | Domain depends on **ports**, not `adapters/*`. Composition root: `api/services.build_services()` (ADR-0028; `api/main.py` is wiring + ≤4-statement route forwards). Inject dependencies; do not construct infrastructure inside domain logic. The domain→adapters ban is now test-enforced (`test_structure_guards.test_domain_never_imports_adapters`, ADR-0034), with two allowlisted seams. |

**Deletion test:** if deleting a module only moves lines around (no complexity concentrates), it was shallow — do not add more of those.

### Python best practices

| Area | Expectation |
|---|---|
| **Version** | Target **Python 3.12** (matches `app/Dockerfile`). Avoid 3.13+–only syntax unless the image moves. |
| **Style** | Match surrounding code: existing imports, naming, logging, async patterns. Prefer `from __future__ import annotations` where the file already uses it. |
| **Types** | Annotate public functions and Protocol methods. Use `Protocol` for seams (`ports/`). Prefer `X \| None` over `Optional[X]` in new code when consistent with the file. |
| **Async** | Domain I/O is async. Tests: use a dedicated event loop helper (`asyncio.new_event_loop().run_until_complete`) — do not rely on deprecated implicit loops. |
| **Errors** | Raise domain/port exceptions (`PMOTransient`, `ForgeError`, …); do not leak `httpx`/`redis` types upward. |
| **Secrets** | Never log or persist credentials. Redact via `security.redact` at PMO/forge egress. No secrets in tests beyond obvious fakes. |
| **Pydantic** | Config and DTOs stay pydantic models; keep field names aligned with `docs/02-domain-model.md`. |
| **No drive-by** | Do not reformat unrelated files, rename widely without need, or expand scope beyond the task. |
| **Docs drift** | If you change a public seam (ports, dispatch spine, lifecycle), update the matching `docs/*` in the same change (zero-drift with `docs/01`–`04` and ADRs). |

### Quick anti-patterns (reject these)

- Leftover ≠ decided. If a locked decision is unimplemented, implement it or refuse the PR. Do not comment the gap.
- Implementing a feature then “adding tests later”
- Typing domain code against concrete `DaguExecutor` / `Messaging` / `RunStore` instead of ports
- Duplicating the ACL → digest → save → start spine outside `RunBootstrap`
- Giant untested functions in `orchestrator.py` without a public-seam test
- `except Exception: pass` that swallows real failures without logging — lint-enforced: ruff `BLE001`; every production blanket catch is narrowed, carries `# noqa: BLE001 — <justification>` naming its contract, or is a logged handler under a sanctioned docs/15 §7 contract (ruff accepts the logged arm without noqa; prefer an explicit noqa at long-lived seams)
- Mutating production modules only “to make the test pass” by weakening invariants
- New endpoint bodies in `api/main.py` or new attributes bound onto `MissionManager` after its class body — main.py is wiring + ≤4-statement route forwards (composition happens in `api/services.build_services()`, ADR-0028), orchestrator behavior lives in module functions taking `mgr` (ADR-0015; enforced by `tests/test_structure_guards.py`)
- New checkpoint-step key literals — every `finalized_steps`/`_checkpoint` key registers in `domain/orchestrator/steps.py` (ADR-0034; the AST guard in `test_structure_guards` rejects bare literals). Same file forbids a domain module importing `adapters/*` outside the two allowlisted seams.

## Docker images: Bake only

**DevCake images are built only with Docker Bake.** Compose never builds them.

| Command | What it builds |
|---|---|
| `docker buildx bake all` | Everything — **use this on first setup and full upgrades** |
| `docker buildx bake` | Control plane only: `app` + `admin` (prod — **no** pytest) |
| `docker buildx bake app-test` | App + pytest + `tests/` for CI (`devcake/app-test`) |
| `docker buildx bake images` | Dev harnesses + hello stub (shared `base` stage) |
| `docker buildx bake ci` | `app` + `app-test` + `admin` + `hello` (PR loop without full harness matrix) |
| `docker compose up -d` | **Run** the stack (requires images already baked) |

**Build cache:** opt-in — `BAKE_LOCAL_CACHE=1` exports to `.buildx-cache/` (gitignored), but needs a docker-container builder or the containerd image store; the default `docker` driver refuses cache export, so plain `bake` commands stay cache-less and work on a stock Docker Engine. On GitHub Actions, workflows bake `docker-bake.hcl` only and apply `type=gha` cache via bake-action `set:` with a **per-workflow** scope (`devcake-ci` / `devcake-images` / `devcake-publish`) and `ignore-error=true` on cache-to.

**GitHub Actions** (`.github/workflows/`):

| Workflow | When | What |
|---|---|---|
| `ci.yml` | every PR + `main` | Pin gate → admin npm checks → bake group `ci` (sbom:false) → ruff → pip-audit → Redis + fresh `app-test` pytest → compose via `scripts/ci_compose_for_dispatch.sh` **with Gitea** (`CI_COMPOSE_WITH_GITEA=1`) → `scripts/ci_dispatch_hello.sh` → forge/PMO contract batteries. Permissions: `contents: read` only. |
| `docker-images.yml` | `images/**` changes + `main` + manual | Bake group `images` → harness CLI smoke + hello redis-import smoke (layer only; full dispatch is `ci.yml`). No SBOM. |
| `docker-publish.yml` | **manual** (`workflow_dispatch`) | Bake `all` + push to GHCR (`ghcr.io/<owner>/devcake/<name>`); `packages: write`; SBOM + provenance on this bake only — not a tree-wide SBOM program. |

**Local unit path:** `./scripts/pytest_app.sh` — always rebuilds `app-test` (Buildx bake preferred; Dockerfile `--target test` fallback when bake is missing, e.g. buildah), then pytest.  
**Local suite:** `scripts/ci_suite.sh` — pin gate + rebuild app-test + ruff + pytest + forge/PMO contracts + dispatch-hello; requires a **healthy stack already up**; not a full GHA clone (no npm/pip-audit, no control-plane rebake); mixed-version live stack prints a loud banner and is not tree evidence.  
**Clean-room dispatch compose:** `scripts/ci_compose_for_dispatch.sh` (default without Gitea; set `CI_COMPOSE_WITH_GITEA=1` for contracts). `CI_COMPOSE_WRITE_ENV=1` / `GITHUB_ACTIONS=true` **overwrites `.env`**.

### Do

- Build/rebuild with `docker buildx bake` / `bake all` / `bake images` (see `docker-bake.hcl`).
- After changing `app/`, `admin/`, or `images/`, rebake the affected targets (or `bake all`).
- Keep app/admin tags aligned with compose: `DEVCAKE_TAG` in bake and compose — the checkout's `VERSION` file pins it (bumped with the changelog at every release; CI refuses a drift), `devcake up` writes it into `.env`.
- For **new behavior**: red→green TDD first (see **Engineering standards**), then bake/prove Always Works™.

### Do not

- Do **not** add `build:` back to `docker-compose.yml` for DevCake images.
- Do **not** use `docker compose build` or `docker compose --profile images build` — those paths are gone.
- Do **not** expect `docker compose up --build` to build `devcake/*` images (`pull_policy: never`).
- Do **not** invent per-harness Dockerfiles under `images/<harness>/` — use multi-target `images/Dockerfile` + a target in `docker-bake.hcl`.

### Layout

| Path | Role |
|---|---|
| `docker-bake.hcl` | **Single source of truth** for image builds and tags |
| `docker-compose.yml` | Runtime only (networks, volumes, third-party images) |
| `app/Dockerfile` | Multi-stage FastAPI app → tag `devcake/app:${TAG}` |
| `admin/Dockerfile` | Multi-stage SPA + nginx → tag `devcake/admin:${TAG}` |
| `images/Dockerfile` | Multi-target Dev harnesses (`base`, `hello`, `claude-code`, `codex`, `grok-build`, `pi`, `opencode`, `qwen-code`) |
| `app/devcake/harness.py` | Runtime image names for Dagu dispatch (`devcake/dev-*:${DEVCAKE_TAG}`, default `latest`) |

### Typical agent workflows

```bash
# After editing orchestrator / API
docker buildx bake app && docker compose up -d app

# After editing admin SPA
docker buildx bake admin && docker compose up -d admin

# After editing images/common/dev_entrypoint.py or a harness
docker buildx bake images

# Full lockstep (app + admin + all Dev images) — required when protocol/entrypoint changes
docker buildx bake all && docker compose up -d

# ADR-0025: dev-run.yaml + compose + .env (DEVCAKE_WS_HOST) also deploy in
# lockstep. dagu/dags is a LIVE :ro bind, so a new DAG goes live at `git pull`
# before devcake up — stop dagu first: docker compose stop dagu && devcake up --bake
```

The tag pin (bake and compose must match) is the checkout's `VERSION` file;
a development build overrides it from the process environment:

```bash
DEVCAKE_TAG=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD) devcake up --bake   # scratch build (control plane; Dev images are the baker's)
devcake up --bake                # a release checkout: VERSION pins the tag
devcake up --release             # a host re-pin: newest v* tag, control plane bake, up, image tidy-up
# or without devcake up:
export DEVCAKE_TAG=$(cat VERSION); docker buildx bake all; docker compose up -d
```

`devcake up` resolves `DEVCAKE_TAG` once (process env > `VERSION` > `latest`;
`.env` is never a source), exports it for bake + compose, and **writes it into
`.env`** so a later plain `docker compose up -d` stays lockstep. Compose passes the pin into the app
container, and **dispatch derives the harness image tags from it**
(`app/devcake/harness.py`). An app container recreated with neither export nor
`.env` pin falls back to `:latest` for app, admin, *and* dispatched harnesses.

### Third-party images

Redis, Dagu, OpenObserve, Fluent Bit still come from registries via compose (`docker compose pull`). Only **DevCake-built** images go through bake.
