# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

GEM (GPU-accelerated Emulator-inspired RTL simulation) is a GPU-accelerated RTL logic simulator originally developed by NVIDIA Research. It works like an FPGA-based RTL emulator: it synthesizes designs into an and-inverter graph (AIG), maps them to a virtual manycore Boolean processor, then emulates on GPUs for 5-40X speedup over CPU-based simulators.

Supports three GPU backends: **CUDA** (NVIDIA GPUs), **HIP** (AMD GPUs via ROCm), and **Metal** (Apple Silicon Macs).

**Key limitation**: Synchronous logic only — no latches or async sequential logic. The `sim` command takes a static input VCD; the `cosim` command runs reactive peripheral models (SPI flash, UART, Wishbone bus trace) as GPU kernels alongside the design, so inputs can depend on design outputs cycle-by-cycle.

## Build Commands

Requires Rust toolchain (via rustup.rs) and either CUDA, HIP (ROCm), or Metal support.

```bash
# Initialize submodules (required first time)
git submodule update --init --recursive

# Build and run mapping tool (no GPU features needed)
cargo run -r --bin jacquard -- map --help

# Metal simulation (macOS)
cargo run -r --features metal --bin jacquard -- sim --help

# CUDA simulation (Linux/NVIDIA)
cargo run -r --features cuda --bin jacquard -- sim --help

# HIP simulation (Linux/AMD)
cargo run -r --features hip --bin jacquard -- sim --help
```

## Typical Workflow

1. **Memory synthesis** (Yosys): Map memories using `memlib_yosys.txt` → outputs `memory_mapped.v`
2. **Logic synthesis** (DC or Yosys): Synthesize to `aigpdk.lib` cells → outputs `gatelevel.gv`
3. **Simulation**: `jacquard sim gatelevel.gv input.vcd output.vcd NUM_BLOCKS`

Partitioning happens automatically at simulation start. Set `NUM_BLOCKS` to 2× the number of GPU streaming multiprocessors (SMs) for CUDA, 2× the number of Compute Units (CUs) for HIP/AMD, or 1 for Metal.

## Architecture

### Core Pipeline

```
NetlistDB (Verilog) → AIG → StagedAIG → Partitions → FlattenedScript → GPU Kernel (CUDA or Metal)
```

### Key Modules (`src/`)

- **`aigpdk.rs`**: Defines the AIGPDK standard cell library interface (AND gates, DFFs, clock gates, SRAMs)
- **`aig.rs`**: And-inverter graph representation. Converts NetlistDB to AIG with DriverType (AndGate, DFF, RAMBlock, etc.) and EndpointGroup abstractions
- **`staging.rs`**: Splits AIG into pipeline stages based on `--level-split` thresholds for deep circuits
- **`repcut.rs`**: Hypergraph partitioning using mt-kahypar for mapping to GPU blocks
- **`pe.rs`**: Partition executor - builds BoomerangStage structures (hierarchical 8192→1 reduction) that map to GPU block resources
- **`flatten.rs`**: Generates FlattenedScriptV1 - the final GPU execution script with packed instructions

### GPU Kernels (`csrc/`)

- **`kernel_v1.cu`/`kernel_v1_impl.cuh`**: CUDA simulation kernel implementing the Boolean processor
- **`kernel_v1.hip.cpp`**: HIP simulation kernel (AMD GPUs via ROCm) — shares `kernel_v1_impl.cuh` with CUDA
- **`kernel_v1.metal`**: Metal simulation kernel (macOS Apple Silicon)

### Binary Tools (`src/bin/`)

- **`jacquard.rs`**: Unified CLI — `jacquard sim` (GPU simulation), `jacquard cosim` (co-simulation)
- **`timing_analysis.rs`**: Static timing analysis utility (development tool)

### Dependencies (`vendor/eda-infra-rs` submodule)

Open-source Rust gate-level EDA infrastructure (https://github.com/gzz2000/eda-infra-rs):

- **`netlistdb`**: Flattened gate-level circuit netlist database. Stores cells, pins, nets with `Direction` (I/O), hierarchical names (`HierName`), and CSR-based connectivity (`VecCSR`). Created via `NetlistDB::from_sverilog_file()`.
- **`sverilogparse`**: Structural Verilog parser. Parses modules, wire definitions, assigns, and cell instantiations. Use `SVerilog::parse_str()`. Supports wire expressions including bit selects, slices, and concatenations.
- **`vcd-ng`**: VCD (Value Change Dump) reader/writer. `Parser` for reading with `FastFlow` for high-performance streaming. `Writer` for output generation.
- **`ulib`**: Universal computing library for heterogeneous CPU/GPU memory. Key types: `UVec<T>` (universal vector with automatic host/device sync), `Device` enum (CPU, CUDA(id), or Metal), `AsUPtrMut` trait. Enable with `--features cuda` or `--features metal`.
- **`ucc`**: Build system for Rust-C++-CUDA interop. Manages C++ header dependencies between crates (`export_csrc`/`import_csrc`), compiles CUDA sources (`cl_cuda()`), generates FFI bindings (`bindgen()`), and creates `compile_commands.json` for LSP.
- **`clilog`**: Logging wrapper over `log` crate with message type tagging and automatic suppression. Macros: `clilog::info!()`, `clilog::debug!()`, `clilog::warn!()`. Timer support via `clilog::stimer!()`/`clilog::finish!()`.

### AIG PDK Files (`aigpdk/`)

- `aigpdk.lib`/`aigpdk.db`: Liberty library for DC synthesis
- `aigpdk_nomem.lib`: Library without memory cells (for Yosys)
- `aigpdk.v`: Verilog models including `CKLNQD` clock gate
- `memlib_yosys.txt`: Memory mapping rules for Yosys

## Key Constraints

GPU block resource limits (from `pe.rs`):
- Max 8191 unique inputs per partition
- Max 8191 unique outputs per partition
- Max 4095 intermediate pins alive per stage
- Max 64 SRAM output groups

If mapping fails with "single endpoint cannot map", use `--level-split` to force stage splits (e.g., `--level-split 30` or `--level-split 20,40`).

## Testing

```bash
# Run with CPU baseline verification (CUDA)
cargo run -r --features cuda --bin jacquard -- sim ... --check-with-cpu

# Limit simulation cycles (CUDA)
cargo run -r --features cuda --bin jacquard -- sim ... --max-cycles 1000

# HIP equivalent (AMD)
cargo run -r --features hip --bin jacquard -- sim ... --max-cycles 1000

# Metal equivalent
cargo run -r --features metal --bin jacquard -- sim ... --max-cycles 1000
```

## Benchmarks

Pre-synthesized benchmark designs are in `benchmarks/dataset/` (git submodule). See `benchmarks/README.md` for full instructions.

```bash
# Run Metal simulation benchmark (NVDLA - smallest, good for testing)
cargo run -r --features metal --bin jacquard -- sim \
    benchmarks/dataset/nvdlaAIG.gv \
    benchmarks/dataset/nvdla.pdp_16x6x16_4x2_split_max_int8_0.vcd \
    benchmarks/nvdla_output.vcd \
    1

# Criterion micro-benchmarks (no GPU required)
cargo bench --bench event_buffer
```

Available designs: NVDLA (254 MB), Rocket (124 MB), Gemmini (165 MB).

## Debugging Tools

### Netlist Graph Analysis (`scripts/netlist_graph/`)

**IMPORTANT**: Use this tool for tracing signal paths in post-synthesis netlists. It's much faster than manual grep-based analysis.

Install via `uv sync --group dev` from repo root — `netlist-graph` is a workspace member, so the console script is on the workspace's `uv run` path. No `cd` required.

```bash
# Trace what drives a signal (backwards through logic)
uv run netlist-graph drivers <netlist.v> "<signal>" -d 8

# Trace where a signal goes (forwards through logic)
uv run netlist-graph loads <netlist.v> "<signal>" -d 5

# Find path between two signals
uv run netlist-graph path <netlist.v> "<source>" "<target>"

# Search for nets matching pattern
uv run netlist-graph search <netlist.v> "<pattern>"

# Generate watchlist JSON for signal monitoring
uv run netlist-graph watchlist <netlist.v> output.json signal1 signal2 ...

# Generate SRAM port trace file for --trace-signals
uv run netlist-graph sram-ports <netlist.v> --manifest lib.cells.toml -o sram_trace.txt
uv run netlist-graph sram-ports <netlist.v> --cell-type SRAM  # auto-detect by name

# Interactive mode for exploration
uv run netlist-graph interactive <netlist.v>
```

Example debugging session:
```bash
# Why isn't flash_ack being asserted?
uv run netlist-graph drivers tests/timing_test/minimal_build/6_final.v "spiflash.ctrl.wb_bus__ack" -d 5

# Trace reset path to CPU
uv run netlist-graph path tests/timing_test/minimal_build/6_final.v "gpio_in[40]" "ibus__cyc"

# SRAM observability: discover port wires, then trace them
uv run netlist-graph sram-ports design.v --cell-type SRAM -o sram_trace.txt
jacquard cosim design.v --config sim.json --trace-signals sram_trace.txt --timing-vcd out.vcd
```

### In-Design Signal Tracing (`--trace-signals`)

The `--trace-signals <PATH>` flag on `jacquard sim` and `jacquard cosim` surfaces user-selected internal nets in the output VCD alongside top-level IO. The trace file is one hierarchical signal name per line (`#` comments and blank lines ignored). Signal names are resolved against `netlistdb` using a multi-candidate parser that handles Yosys-flattened, scalar-expanded, and structurally-hierarchical naming conventions. Full user guide: `docs/signal-tracing.md`.

The recommended workflow for SRAM observability is wire-level tracing via `--trace-signals` rather than the env-var-gated `JACQUARD_SRAM_DUMP`:
1. `netlist-graph sram-ports` discovers SRAM port wire names from the netlist
2. `--trace-signals` surfaces them in the VCD with full per-tick accuracy (via GPU ring buffer)
3. Post-process the VCD to reconstruct bus values (future: wire-bundle scripting)

**Open question**: is it worth porting `netlist-graph` to Rust? The Python tool handles large netlists (40K cells in ~1s) but shares no code with the Rust `netlistdb`/`sverilogparse` parsers. A Rust port could reuse `sverilogparse` directly and integrate with `jacquard` as a subcommand.

### Bus Transaction Tracing (`--bus-trace-csv`)

The structured, protocol-aware counterpart to `--trace-signals`: instead
of raw per-cycle wires, it decodes on-chip bus transfers into
transaction records (`WR 0x10 <= 0xCAFEBABE`). Buses are declared via
`bus_traces` in `sim_config.json`; cosim observes the pins on the GPU and
runs the protocol FSM on the CPU. **APB3** is supported; AHB-Lite/AHB5
are planned. See `docs/bus-tracing.md` for the full guide,
`docs/adr/0013-plural-peripheral-configs.md` for the architecture, and
`tests/apb_trace/` for a worked example.

### Timing Violation Detection

See `docs/timing-violations.md` for the full guide on enabling GPU-side setup/hold violation checks, interpreting violation reports, and tracing violations back to source signals using `netlist_graph`.

### X-value Debugging (`xsources` + `xroots`)

When `cosim --xprop` produces an `x` on a signal, find *why* statically
instead of trace→guess→re-run. `jacquard xsources <netlist> --config
sim.json -o xsources.json` enumerates the design's X-sources (unreset DFFs,
SRAM reads, undriven inputs) as JSON; `netlist-graph xroots <netlist>
<signal> --xsources xsources.json` reverse-walks the signal's cone and reports
the nearest X-source frontier, with `--emit-trace` writing a `--trace-signals`
list for a confirming run. Full guide: `docs/x-debugging.md`.

## Python tooling

Python tools (PDK fetchers, build scripts, harness utilities) belong in
the workspace's `uv` dev dependency group, not as ad-hoc system pip
installs. Add them under `[dependency-groups].dev` in the root
`pyproject.toml`; install with `uv sync --group dev`; invoke via
`uv run <tool>`. CI mirrors this — see the dev group declarations and
PDK install steps in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

PDK Liberty / tech files are fetched via **volare** (pinned in
`[tool.jacquard.pdks.*]` in the root `pyproject.toml`, hashes mirrored
into `crates/opensta-to-ir/tests/opensta_integration.rs`). Volare has
been renamed to **ciel** upstream
(<https://github.com/fossi-foundation/ciel>) — the existing `volare`
PyPI package still works at the pinned version, but a migration to the
`ciel` package is open follow-up.

## Releases

Cutting a release is a lightweight, manual procedure: roll the
`[Unreleased]` block in `CHANGELOG.md`, bump `Cargo.toml::version`,
tag, push. Full procedure plus the pre-release checklist (still-open
items before the first numbered release) is in
`docs/release-process.md`. Stable contracts (`--timing-report` JSON
schema, timing IR FlatBuffers schema) are governed by their own ADRs
and bump separately from the binary version.

## Handoffs

This project treats handoffs as ephemeral working memory, not historical record. When you write one, follow `docs/handoff-discipline.md` — markdown at `docs/handoffs/<topic>-handoff.md` (sibling to `docs/plans/`, deliberately separate so the persistent plan docs aren't mixed with in-flight working memory). At resolution, fold the content into ADRs / design docs / plan docs, then delete the handoff file. Exactly one handoff exists at a time; resolved ones are removed, not archived. The `git log -- docs/handoffs/` history is the audit trail.

Skill activations for `create_handoff` / `resume_handoff` from external Claude Code toolkits will sometimes default to YAML under `thoughts/shared/handoffs/` with database indexing — that doesn't apply here. Override and follow the project convention.
