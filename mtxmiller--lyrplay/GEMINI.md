## Project Identity

**LyrPlay** is an iOS SwiftUI app that implements a SlimProto client for streaming audio from Logitech Media Server (LMS). It's essentially a **Swift version of squeezelite** — a Squeezebox player replacement with native FLAC support, CarPlay, Siri, and gapless playback.

- **Version state**: build/version live in `LMS_StreamTest.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` (`MARKETING_VERSION`, `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION`). Per-release status (in dev / submitted / live) tracked in the Obsidian wiki under `Releases/`.
- **Bundle ID**: `elm.LMS-StreamTest` (preserved for App Store continuity — never change this)
- **Display Name**: LyrPlay
- **Local Folder**: `LMS_StreamTest` (intentional — don't rename)
- **GitHub**: https://github.com/mtxmiller/LyrPlay
- **Deployment Target**: iOS 15.6+ (affects which APIs are available)

## Build Commands

```bash
pod install                          # Install dependencies (required after clone)
xcodebuild -workspace LMS_StreamTest.xcworkspace -scheme LMS_StreamTest -configuration Debug build
xcodebuild -workspace LMS_StreamTest.xcworkspace -scheme LMS_StreamTest clean
```

**Always use `LMS_StreamTest.xcworkspace`**, never `.xcodeproj` (CocoaPods requirement).

For the CLI build → install → launch loop on a connected iPhone, see the wiki at `Setup/iPhone Build Workflow.md`. Personal device IDs are kept in user-local Claude memory, not committed.

**Test LMS server**: `192.168.1.8` (default ports — 9000 JSON-RPC, 3483 SlimProto) is available on-network for debugging and exercising new features.

## Testing & Verification

Unit test targets exist on both platforms (Swift Testing + XCTest). Run them before claiming a change works:

```bash
# tvOS — use -only-testing: the UITests runner has a known dlopen failure (bd LMS_StreamTest-39m)
xcodebuild test -workspace LMS_StreamTest.xcworkspace -scheme LMS_StreamTest-tvOS \
  -destination 'platform=tvOS Simulator,name=Apple TV 4K (3rd generation)' \
  -only-testing:LMS_StreamTest-tvOSTests

# iOS — device name must exist on the LATEST installed iOS runtime
# (xcodebuild implies OS:latest; a name that only exists on an older runtime
# fails with "Unable to find a device matching"). Check: xcrun simctl list devices available
xcodebuild test -workspace LMS_StreamTest.xcworkspace -scheme LMS_StreamTest \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17' \
  -only-testing:LMS_StreamTestTests
```

The full iOS unit suite passes. (The 3 `PlaybackSessionControllerTests` interruption/route-change tests that used to fail were stale assertions of pre-BASS-migration behavior — local pause/play + manual `setActive` — not an iOS 26 issue; rewritten to assert the current server-command behavior. bd `LMS_StreamTest-u91`, closed.) If unit tests fail, investigate — don't pre-attribute to a known-failing list.

Changes to shared files (`LMS_StreamTest/*.swift` compiled into both targets) must be verified on **both** platforms.

**Server-as-oracle verification**: LyrPlay is a client of an observable server — playback health is machine-checkable over JSON-RPC against the test LMS, no listening required. A healthy pipeline shows: player present in `serverstatus`, `mode == play`, `time` advancing at ~1x wall clock, `playlist_cur_index` changing at expected track boundaries (not early/late). Use these signals to verify playback-adjacent changes end-to-end. Full scenario catalog + assertion library spec: `scripts/smoke/README.md` (implementation tracked in bd epic `LMS_StreamTest-6b1`).

**Still human-only**: audible quality (gapless seams, audio bursts, clicks), CarPlay hardware behavior, real phone-call interruptions, lock-screen timing. Don't claim these verified from a simulator.

**Autonomous pilot loop**: `/pilot` (`.claude/commands/pilot.md`) runs one bd-issue → draft-PR iteration scoped to tvOS/UI work (audio pipeline and recovery files are off-limits to it); `/loop /pilot` keeps it running. It never merges, never closes bd issues, and caps at 3 open draft PRs.

## Issue Tracking

This project uses [bd (beads)](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) for issue tracking. Use `bd` commands, not markdown TODOs. Run `bd ready --json` for available work, `bd create "title" -t bug|feature|task -p 0-4 --json` to file issues, `bd close <id>` to complete.

## Critical Rules

1. **NO ASSUMPTIONS** — Verify everything against the code and reference repos. Use adversarial review when making changes to critical systems (audio pipeline, SlimProto, recovery).
2. **Never manually manage AVAudioSession** — BASS handles all session lifecycle via `BASS_CONFIG_IOS_SESSION`. Manual management causes silent audio failures and conflicts.
3. **Never add an Intents Extension for Siri** — INPlayMediaIntent is handled in the main app via `SiriMediaHandler` in AppDelegate. This is an App Store validation constraint.
4. **Never simplify playlist jump recovery to a simple seek** — Playlist jump is atomic (track index + time offset). Simple seek breaks when the playlist position has changed during backgrounding. Always use noplay=0 (start playing), then pause in callback if needed — noplay=1 breaks position recovery after server timeout.
5. **Never change the bundle ID** — `elm.LMS-StreamTest` is locked for App Store continuity.
6. **Don't add logic to InterruptionManager** — It's a legacy stub. All interruption handling lives in `PlaybackSessionController`.
7. **Don't refactor singletons** — `AudioManager.shared` and `SettingsManager.shared` are singletons by design. CarPlay and main app share the same instances.
8. **Never create a new SlimProtoCoordinator when one exists** — CarPlay and main app share the same coordinator via `AudioManager.shared`. Creating a second one stops playback. See `ContentView.init()` for the reuse pattern.
9. **The 45-second background threshold** governs recovery strategy (quick resume vs full reconnect). Test both paths if changing it.
10. **BASS error checking** — Most BASS functions return 0/FALSE on failure. Call `BASS_ErrorGetCode()` immediately after — errors are thread-local and get overwritten by the next BASS call. BASS callbacks run on arbitrary threads — always marshal to main thread with `DispatchQueue.main.async`.
11. **ICY metadata requires duration > 0** — Sending ICY metadata for infinite streams (radio, duration=0) crashes the LMS server. Always check duration before sending.
12. **Silent recovery muting** — When recovering from backgrounding without playing (app-open recovery), mute BEFORE the stream is created via `enableSilentRecoveryMode()`. Late muting causes audio bursts.

## Architecture & Key Files

### Entry Points
- `SlimProtoCoordinator.swift` — Main orchestrator. Start here.
- `AppDelegate.swift` — Scene routing (CarPlay) and Siri handler
- `ContentView.swift` — Main SwiftUI view with Material WebView

### Audio Pipeline
- `AudioPlayer.swift` — BASS integration, push stream logic, gapless transitions
- `AudioManager.swift` — Singleton coordinating audio components
- `PlaybackSessionController.swift` — Interruptions, remote commands, CarPlay/lock screen commands, position saving

### SlimProto & Networking
- `SlimProtoClient.swift` — Binary protocol over TCP (CocoaAsyncSocket). Big-endian network byte order. Messages: 2-byte length prefix + 4-char command tag.
- `SlimProtoCommandHandler.swift` — Command processing (STRM, STAT, SETD, etc.)
- `SlimProtoConnectionManager.swift` — Connection state, retry logic

### Two Communication Channels with LMS
1. **SlimProto (binary TCP)**: Player registration, streaming commands, STAT responses — persistent connection
2. **JSON-RPC (HTTP)**: Metadata queries, playlist operations, browse commands — stateless requests. Don't mix these up.

### Push Stream Data Flow (Gapless)
Network data → `SlimProtoCommandHandler` → `AudioPlayer.pushStreamProc` (BASS push stream buffer) → BASS pulls and decodes → sync callback fires at track boundary → next track loads. Write position tracking drives boundary detection.

### Playlist Jump Recovery
Atomic track+position recovery via JSON-RPC `playlist jump` with `timeOffset`. Used for all reconnection scenarios (lock screen, CarPlay, backgrounding). Position saved to UserDefaults on pause, route change, disconnect, and backgrounding. See `performPlaylistRecovery()` in `SlimProtoCoordinator.swift`.

### CarPlay & UI
- `CarPlaySceneDelegate.swift` — CarPlay UI (CPTemplateApplicationSceneDelegate)
- `NowPlayingManager.swift` — Lock screen / Control Center metadata
- `SettingsView.swift` / `SettingsManager.swift` — Configuration

## Coding Patterns

- **Logging**: OSLog with subsystem `"com.lmsstream"` — not `print()`, not `Logger`
- **State**: `@Published` properties on `ObservableObject` conforming managers for SwiftUI reactivity
- **New features**: Route through `SlimProtoCoordinator`, not direct component access
- **Error handling**: Handle with recovery — this is a production app with real users. Don't just log errors.
- **Audio formats**: FLAC, WAV, AAC, MP4A, MP3, Opus, OGG via BASS xcframeworks + bridging header
- **IAP**: `PurchaseManager.swift` has StoreKit 2 with an icon pack product. Don't gate features behind IAP without explicit direction.

## Known Limitations

- **FLAC seeking** — Was broken but now-functional with BASS push stream architecture. MP3, AAC, Opus, OGG, WAV seeking. Mitigation: [MobileTranscode](https://github.com/mtxmiller/MobileTranscode) LMS plugin provides server-side transcode rules for mobile clients — converts FLAC to seekable formats (AAC, MP3) and re-encodes FLAC with proper headers that enable seeking.
- **FLAC push stream data** — BASSFLAC 2.4.17.1 fixed `max_framesize=0` early termination via dedicated threading, but edge cases may remain.

## Reference Sources

We're building a Swift squeezelite. Always consult these when implementing or debugging:

| Task | Primary Reference |
|------|-------------------|
| SlimProto messages, HELO/STAT/STRm | `./squeezelite/slimproto.c` |
| Audio buffer, decode/output pipeline | `./squeezelite/output.c`, `decode.c` |
| Server-side playlist/streaming logic | `./slimserver/Slim/Player/Squeezebox.pm` |
| JSON-RPC API calls, browse patterns | `~/Downloads/lms-material/MaterialSkin/HTML/material/` |
| WebView JavaScript injection | `lms-material` JS APIs |
| BASS API functions and configs | `./docs/bass_documentation/` (HTML reference) |

## Current Work

For open work and what's in flight: run `bd ready` for the issue queue and read the latest `Releases/v1.7.X.md` in the wiki for the in-progress release's scope and status. Don't rely on a hardcoded "current work" list here — it rots.

## Deep Documentation

**Read the matching `Architecture/*.md` BEFORE grepping Swift source for any debug or design task in an architecture-touching area.** It gives you the trigger taxonomy, gating logic, and flow diagrams without having to reconstruct them.

The wiki lives in a local Obsidian vault outside the repo (path stored in user-local Claude memory, not committed). Architecture topics: Audio Pipeline, CarPlay, Gapless Playback, Position Recovery, SlimProto Protocol, Material WebView Injection, Server Failover, Reconnection.

Also: `Releases/` for shipped-feature changelogs, `Decisions/` for architectural decision records.

## Skill routing

When the user's request matches an available skill, ALWAYS invoke it using the Skill
tool as your FIRST action. Do NOT answer directly, do NOT use other tools first.
The skill has specialized workflows that produce better results than ad-hoc answers.

Key routing rules:
- Product ideas, "is this worth building", brainstorming → invoke office-hours
- Bugs, errors, "why is this broken", 500 errors → invoke investigate
- Ship, deploy, push, create PR → invoke ship
- QA, test the site, find bugs → invoke qa
- Code review, check my diff → invoke review
- Update docs after shipping → invoke document-release
- Weekly retro → invoke retro
- Design system, brand → invoke design-consultation
- Visual audit, design polish → invoke design-review
- Architecture review → invoke plan-eng-review
- Save progress, checkpoint, resume → invoke checkpoint
- Code quality, health check → invoke health

# Coding 

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

---

**These guidelines are working if:** fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.
