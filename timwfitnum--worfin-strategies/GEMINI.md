## 🔴 READ THIS FIRST — APRIL 2026 PIVOT

**The project now operates on TWO parallel tracks: Metals (primary, paper) and FX (secondary, paper → live).**

The metals thesis is unchanged. £5k live capital is below the metals futures threshold, so metals continues paper-trading per roadmap while FX is added as the capital-efficient live track on IBKR IdealPro. Read `WorFIn_Pivot_Memo.md` in project knowledge before starting any substantive work.

Do NOT relitigate this decision. Do NOT treat FX as a replacement for metals. If a user request is ambiguous about which book they mean, ASK.

## 🎯 PROJECT IDENTITY

We are building a **production-grade systematic trading system** across two asset classes:

- **Metals** (primary): Six statistically-validated strategies on LME base metals and COMEX precious metals. Daily holding periods. Fully automated signal generation. Interactive Brokers execution. Target live capital ≥ £50k.
- **FX** (secondary): Three strategies on G10 FX pairs via IBKR IdealPro. Capital-efficient at £5–50k. Permanent low-correlation diversifier thereafter.

This is a real trading business — every line of code has financial consequences.

**5-Year Roadmap:**
- **Now (Tier 0 → 1):** Backtesting infrastructure + paper trading (both books)
- **Near-term:** Live FX at £5k when paper cleared. Metals stays paper until capital ≥ £50k.
- **Year 2:** Live metals capital £50–100k personal (target H2 2027)
- **Year 4:** Fund launch £2–5m external AUM
- **Year 5:** Cape Town, £10–20m AUM, 3–4 person firm

## 🧠 CORE PHILOSOPHY — READ THIS FIRST

1. **Risk management IS the strategy.** Never treat risk as a constraint bolted onto alpha — it IS the central organising principle.
2. **A backtest is a hypothesis, not a result.** Only out-of-sample and live paper trading confirm edge.
3. **Overfitting is the #1 threat.** More parameters = more danger. Simpler is better.
4. **Infrastructure before capital.** Nothing goes live until paper-tested for 60+ trading days (G3 gate).
5. **One strategy done properly beats five done poorly.** S4 (Basis-Momentum) is the metals core. Build it first.
6. **Never size by conviction. Size by volatility.** Always inverse-vol targeting — applies identically to metals and FX.
7. **The kill switch must always work.** Every component must be stoppable in <60 seconds.
8. **FX is a parallel track, not a replacement.** Do not let FX work delay metals validation.

---

## 📐 CURRENT PHASE & ACTIVE WORK

**Phase:** Tier 0 → Tier 1 transition
**Active tracks:**
- Metals: complete S4 Basis-Momentum IS backtest (G0 gate)
- FX: DESIGN ONLY until metals S4 clears G0; do not start FX build yet

**Sequencing (strict order):**

1. Step 0 verification pass on files Tim added (`continuous.py`, `002_pnl_accounting.py`, `003_fx_rates.py`, `pretrade_intergation.py`)
2. S4 Basis-Momentum IS backtest (2005–2017) — must clear G0 (IS Sharpe ≥ 0.50, t-stat ≥ 3.0, max DD ≤ 20%)
3. **Asset-class-agnostic refactor** (`InstrumentSpec` hierarchy, `CostModel` polymorphism, strategy parameterisation)
4. FX data layer (FRED short rates, FX historicals, `FXSpec` instances)
5. FX backtests (FX1, FX2, FX3) — apply G0, G1 gates
6. FX paper trading (alongside metals paper, 60+ trading days)
7. Live FX at £5k when G3 cleared
8. Metals paper continues until capital ≥ £50k and metals G3 cleared, then flip to live

**When I ask you to build something, always check:**
- Which book is it for — metals, FX, or asset-agnostic?
- Does this serve the current phase?
- Is it the simplest implementation that works?
- Does it respect all risk limits defined below?
- Is it testable and auditable?
- Am I about to work on FX before metals S4 has cleared G0? (If yes: STOP.)

## 🗄️ DATABASE SCHEMA — CANONICAL STRUCTURE

The schema is asset-class-agnostic. Same tables serve metals and FX.

```sql
-- LAYER 1: Raw ingest (immutable — never modify after insert)
schema: raw_data
  tables: lme_prices, comex_prices, lme_inventory, cftc_cot, macro_indicators,
          fred_rates (NEW: short rates for FX carry),
          fx_prices (NEW: spot + forward points for G10)

-- LAYER 2: Clean, normalised, roll-adjusted
schema: clean_data
  tables: futures_prices, continuous_series, realised_vol, term_structure,
          fx_spot, fx_forwards (NEW)

-- LAYER 3: Computed signals
schema: signals
  tables: carry_signals, momentum_signals, basis_signals, inventory_signals, pairs_signals
  -- Same tables serve metals and FX; disambiguated via instrument_id foreign key

-- LAYER 4: Portfolio & execution
schema: positions
  tables: target_positions, current_positions, position_history

schema: orders
  tables: order_log, fill_log, execution_quality

-- LAYER 5: Audit & monitoring
schema: audit
  tables: system_events, data_quality_flags, reconciliation_log, risk_breaches, roll_log
```

**Rules:**
- Never query across schemas in strategy code — use views
- raw_data is append-only, never update or delete
- Every table has created_at and updated_at timestamps (TIMESTAMPTZ)
- All tables carry `bar_size` and `valid_from`/`valid_until` for intraday-readiness
- P&L tables carry `environment` and `backtest_run_id` columns for run comparison
- FX P&L settles to GBP via daily close rate; audit flag for stale FX rates (>7 days)

## 🚀 EXECUTION RULES

### Metals (LME + COMEX)

- LME Base Metals: Execute 14:00–16:00 London (deepest liquidity)
- COMEX Precious: Execute 14:00–16:00 London (London/NY overlap)
- S1/S4: Execute AFTER LME official prices published (~13:30 London)
- S5: Execute 30min AFTER LME inventory report (~09:30 London)
- LME rolls: ALWAYS as single spread order (never leg separately)

### FX (IdealPro)

- FX1 Carry: Execute Monday open (~08:00 London) after Friday-close rebalance
- FX2 TSMOM: Execute 17:00 UTC daily (end of NY session, before Asia open)
- FX3 XS Mom: Execute 17:00 UTC on bi-weekly schedule
- No roll management (spot FX has no expiry)
- Financing via IBKR daily rollover (swap points embedded in P&L)

### Order management (both books, always follow this sequence)

1. Passive limit at mid-price (60 seconds)
2. Aggressive limit at best bid/offer (60 seconds)
3. Market order fallback (should be <10% of executions)

### Pre-trade checks (MANDATORY before every order, both books)

- Order within position limits
- Won't breach gross/net exposure limits
- Within liquidity tier maximum (rolling 20-day ADV for futures; spread tier for FX)
- Price within 2% of current mid (fat-finger protection)
- Daily order count within maximum
- Direction matches signal (prevents sign errors)
- FX-specific: FX rate staleness <7 days (audit flag, never silent fallback)

## 🔑 CODING STANDARDS

**General:**
- Type hints on ALL functions — no exceptions
- Docstrings on all public functions and classes
- No magic numbers — all constants in `config/`
- All monetary values as `Decimal`, never `float`
- All dates as `datetime` with TIMESTAMPTZ, UTC internally
- Never hardcode FX rates (no `1.27`), never hardcode DTE (no `91`), never hardcode anything universe-specific

**Strategy code specifically:**
- Every strategy inherits from `BaseStrategy` and accepts a `universe` parameter
- Metals-specific strategies (S4, S5, S6) explicitly type-constrain their universe to `Metal`
- Generic strategies (carry, tsmom, xs_momentum) accept any `InstrumentSpec` universe
- Signals return values in range [-1, +1] (normalised z-score)
- Position sizing happens in `risk/sizing.py`, NEVER inside strategy code
- Strategies are stateless — they take data in, return signals out
- No `print()` statements — use `logging` module with `correlation_id` throughout

**Risk code specifically:**
- Hard limits in `risk/limits.py` are constants — never modify at runtime
- Circuit breakers run as a SEPARATE process from the signal engine
- Every risk breach is logged to `audit.risk_breaches` with full context
- Kill switch must work even if the main execution process is hung

**Testing:**
- Unit tests for every signal calculation
- Property-based tests for position sizing (always within limits)
- Integration tests for the full backtest pipeline
- Never mock the risk limits — test against real limits
- FX tests must not assume futures semantics (no expiry, no roll, no lot size)

---

## ⚠️ THINGS CLAUDE SHOULD NEVER DO

1. **Never bypass risk limits** — not even "just for testing"
2. **Never hardcode API keys, passwords, or credentials**
3. **Never hardcode FX rates or DTE** — they must be dynamic
4. **Never modify the OOS/Holdout data splits** after they're set
5. **Never optimise parameters on OOS data** — it becomes contaminated IS data
6. **Never submit live orders without all pre-trade checks passing**
7. **Never assume a signal is correct** — validate data quality first
8. **Never delete from raw_data** — it's immutable
9. **Never add complexity** that the current phase doesn't require
10. **Never skip transaction costs** in backtests — "fiction without them"
11. **Never use `float`** for monetary calculations
12. **Never use `empyrical`** — it's broken on Python 3.12; use custom metrics
13. **Never start FX build before metals S4 has cleared G0** — roadmap discipline
14. **Never relitigate the April 2026 pivot** — the decision is made and documented
15. **Never conflate the metals and FX books** — when ambiguous, ask which one

## 🧑‍💻 ABOUT THE DEVELOPER

- **Tim** — CIO/CTO. Front-office metals support background (Macquarie).
  ARPM-trained. Production engineering experience.
- Building this part-time (10–15 hours/week evenings and weekends)
- Solo until 2029 — every milestone must be achievable by one person
- **James** joins 2029 as COO/Head of Capital — investor relations, fundraising
- **Jared** — legal advisor (corporate structuring, FSCA)
- Target HQ: Cape Town by 2031

**Working style preferences:**
- Favour simple, correct code over clever, complex code
- Always explain the "why" behind implementation choices
- Flag when I'm about to build something the current phase doesn't need
- If something is risky or could lose money, say so explicitly
- When uncertain between two approaches, show both with trade-offs
- Ask clarifying questions before assuming on structural decisions
- Never build ahead of verification (Step 0 discipline)
