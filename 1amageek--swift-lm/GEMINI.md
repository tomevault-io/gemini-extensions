# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to Codex (Codex.ai/code) when working in this repository.

## Global Instructions

These repository instructions are cumulative with `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` and the
repository-local `CLAUDE.md`. When one of these documents changes, keep the
shared rules aligned here as well.

### Trust and ownership

- Trust is the highest-priority value. Investigate suspicious or ambiguous
  content before acting.
- Assume repository ownership and GitHub operations are tied to
  `https://github.com/1amageek`.

### Commit, documentation, and language rules

- Never include Claude or AI promotion in git commit messages.
- Never add `Co-Authored-By: Claude` or similar signatures.
- When reading Apple documentation on `developer.apple.com/documentation`, use
  `remark`.
- Keep user-facing conversation in Japanese.
- Keep code comments, identifiers, `MARK` sections, and documentation comments
  in English.

### Prompt and coding rules

- Do not include few-shot examples in prompts sent to LLMs. Describe the schema
  and constraints without example answers.
- Follow SOLID, value types first, protocol-oriented design, one primary type
  per file, dependency injection, and explicit typed error handling.
- Do not use `try?`.
- Set timeouts on test commands and run tests in focused scopes.
- Before fixing code, read the related area, understand the impact, and prefer
  root-cause fixes over symptom patches.
- Do not silence compiler or type errors with casts whose only purpose is to
  make the error disappear.
- Do not mix unrelated changes into a bug fix.
- Never introduce silent fallback behavior. Report failures explicitly and let
  callers decide.
- Wrap synchronous AI-model load and inference boundaries in
  `autoreleasepool` when Metal-backed objects would otherwise outlive the
  needed scope.

## Project Goal

`swift-lm` is a Core AI-first declarative model authoring and export package for
macOS and iOS 27+. It provides the graph and runtime foundation for Core
AI-backed language-model applications on Apple platforms.

The core thesis is to describe model families once in Swift, normalize them to
backend-independent IR, and emit a validated Core AI export contract. Apple's
official exporter owns deployment asset generation for supported models. Custom
stateful families use the low-level Core AI Torch converter and Swift runtime
wrapper.

The direct Metal compiler and `SwiftLM` runtime remain as the 0.10 compatibility
path. They are not the default target for new public APIs or model support.

The consumer input contract is a HuggingFace bundle
(`config.json`, `safetensors`, `tokenizer.json`, and related metadata), not a
model-specific Swift type.

## Project Overview

`swift-lm` is a Swift package for declarative model graphs, Core AI export, and
Core AI runtime integration on Apple platforms.

The current repository is not a GGUF/MLX runtime. The active architecture is:

- HuggingFace model bundles as input: `config.json`, `tokenizer.json`, `tokenizer_config.json`, `chat_template.jinja`, `*.safetensors`
- `safetensors` as the source of truth for weights
- STAF as a regenerable GPU execution cache for the 0.10 compatibility path
- a backend-independent IR and model-declaration DSL
- a versioned Core AI export-document format
- Apple's Core AI model exporter for standard Transformer models
- a low-level Core AI program exporter for custom stateful families
- direct Metal compilation and execution for the 0.10 compatibility path

Core AI consumers start with `CoreAIExportDocument` or the `swiftlm-ir` tool,
validate the document with `swiftlm-coreai`, and produce an `.aimodel` through
Apple's exporter. `SwiftLMFoundationModels` adapts Apple's high-level language
bundle API, while `SwiftLMCoreAI` owns low-level asset and stateful execution.
`SwiftLM.ModelBundleLoader` remains the direct Metal compatibility entry point.

## Build & Test

```bash
# Build
swift build

# Run all tests
xcodebuild test -scheme swift-lm-Package -destination 'platform=macOS'

# Run one test target
xcodebuild test -scheme swift-lm-Package -destination 'platform=macOS' -only-testing:ModelsTests
xcodebuild test -scheme swift-lm-Package -destination 'platform=macOS' -only-testing:SwiftLMTests
xcodebuild test -scheme swift-lm-Package -destination 'platform=macOS' -only-testing:MetalCompilerTests
```

Important:

- Prefer `xcodebuild test` over `swift test` for this repository.
- For the Qwen3.5+ multimodal suites, prefer [`scripts/benchmarks/run-qwen35-vision-tests.sh`](/Users/1amageek/Desktop/swift-lm/scripts/benchmarks/run-qwen35-vision-tests.sh) over a single large `xcodebuild test` invocation. It uses `build-for-testing` once and then runs `test-without-building` suite-by-suite to reduce peak memory pressure.
- For generation benchmarks, prefer [`scripts/benchmarks/run-generation-pipeline.sh`](/Users/1amageek/Desktop/swift-lm/scripts/benchmarks/run-generation-pipeline.sh) over running the full benchmark file in one `xcodebuild test` process. It builds once and then runs the split benchmark suites sequentially.
- Generation benchmark suites are intentionally split by cost:
  - `SwiftLMTests/GenerationThroughputBenchmarkTests`
  - `SwiftLMTests/GenerationScalingBenchmarkTests` for `50/128/256`
  - `SwiftLMTests/GenerationScalingLongBenchmarkTests` for `512`
  - `SwiftLMTests/GenerationStreamingBenchmarkTests`
- Keep `512`-token scaling isolated in its own suite. Combining it with shorter scaling cases can exceed the 120-second outer timeout even when individual cases are healthy.
- For very long generation-length benchmarks such as `512`, reduce benchmark repetitions before raising the outer timeout. Prefer fewer iterations over a larger timeout so failures still surface quickly.
- For real-model / Metal-heavy / large-bundle tests, do not batch multiple expensive cases into one long `xcodebuild test` process when you are debugging correctness. Prefer `build-for-testing` once, then `test-without-building` one test at a time. This avoids cumulative GPU memory pressure, repeated model loads in a single process, and hard-to-diagnose xctest crashes.
- When validating output quality for a specific model/policy combination, prefer one focused test per invocation over a whole suite. If you need multiple policy comparisons, run them as separate `test-without-building` invocations.
- For repeated real-model loads inside tests/helpers, explicitly scope temporary objects tightly and prefer `autoreleasepool` on synchronous helper boundaries when possible. Do not keep multiple large `LanguageModelContext` / `TextEmbeddingContext` / tokenizer / bundle instances alive longer than needed.
- When `xcodebuild` reports `unexpected exit`, `Restarting after unexpected exit`, or flaky suite-level process failure, rerun with [`scripts/xcodebuild/test-timeout.sh`](/Users/1amageek/Desktop/swift-lm/scripts/xcodebuild/test-timeout.sh) or [`scripts/xcodebuild/test-hang-guard.sh`](/Users/1amageek/Desktop/swift-lm/scripts/xcodebuild/test-hang-guard.sh) before changing inference code.
- Metal-dependent tests and generated libraries are exercised via the package Xcode scheme.
- Repository targets currently declare Swift tools `6.4` and platforms `.macOS(.v27)`, `.iOS(.v27)` in [Package.swift](/Users/1amageek/Desktop/swift-lm/Package.swift).
- Core AI products require Xcode 27 and the matching Core AI beta SDK.

### Crash-Resistant Real-Model Test Procedure

When correctness work touches Metal execution, real bundles, or large references, use this procedure instead of ad hoc suite runs:

1. Build once with a hard timeout:
   `perl -e 'alarm shift; exec @ARGV' 120 xcodebuild build-for-testing -scheme swift-lm-Package -destination 'platform=macOS'`
2. Run one focused suite or one focused test process at a time:
   `perl -e 'alarm shift; exec @ARGV' 120 xcodebuild test-without-building -scheme swift-lm-Package -destination 'platform=macOS' -only-testing:<Target>/<SuiteOrCase>`
3. After each heavy invocation, inspect whether the process completed normally before starting the next one. Do not queue multiple `xcodebuild` test processes in parallel.
4. If a suite restarts, crashes, or prints `unexpected exit`, stop batching immediately and reduce scope further.
5. Do not add whole-plan snapshot capture to a heavy real-model test unless the narrow failure cannot be localized any other way.
6. If a full suite is still unstable, split it into smaller `@Suite` groups by concern such as output, prompt-state, and capability so `-only-testing:<Target>/<Suite>` remains usable with Swift Testing.

Rules:

- Outer timeout must stay at `120` seconds or less. Prefer `30-60` seconds for lighter checks.
- For correctness debugging, prefer this order:
  1. contract test
  2. focused real-model output test
  3. optimizer equivalence test
- If a suite is known to allocate large intermediates or many snapshots, split it before changing inference code.
- If repeated synchronous helper loops load large models, add `autoreleasepool` boundaries before expanding test coverage.

### Output-Correctness-First Procedure

For Metal / compiler / runtime changes, validate in this order:

1. fragment and planner contracts
2. focused real-model output correctness
3. regression tests across optimizer modes
4. benchmark tests

Rules:

- Do not treat benchmark improvements as success unless output quality is already confirmed for the same model and prompt class.
- If a model emits incorrect text, investigate correctness first. Performance numbers from that build are not meaningful.
- For output verification, prefer deterministic or near-deterministic settings first (`temperature = 0` or fixed sampling state) before broader sampling checks.
- When a bug appears only under sampling, inspect the host-sampling path separately from the argmax path. CPU-readable/shared logits and GPU-only/private logits must not be conflated.
- Compare optimizer modes explicitly (`none`, `standard`, `aggressive` or their effective fallback) before concluding that a fragment or kernel is correct.

### Fragment / Compiler Debugging Procedure

`swift-lm` is assembled from fragments and compiler routing. A single broken fragment contract can corrupt the full model.

When debugging model corruption:

1. verify the declaration-level structure
2. verify fragment expansion for the affected primitive
3. verify dispatch-entry routing and output marking
4. verify prefill and decode buffer-source selection
5. verify shared/private CPU/GPU ownership assumptions
6. only then inspect model-family specific logic

Checklist:

- Sibling projections that are conceptually parallel (`q_proj` / `k_proj` / `v_proj`, `gate_proj` / `up_proj`) must read from the same pre-projection source unless the design explicitly says otherwise.
- Do not assume sequential dispatch entries imply sequential dataflow. The compiler must preserve graph semantics, not emission order.
- Any CPU read path must use CPU-readable storage. `MTLBuffer.contents()` on `storageModePrivate` is invalid.
- Scratch-slot routing must be validated with explicit stride/offset assertions. Hidden-size stride and slot-dimension stride are not interchangeable.
- Residency, ownership, and submission are separate concerns. Do not hide resource lifetime assumptions inside unrelated runtime types.

### Probe and Regression Guidance

- Long-lived probes must be gated by `ENABLE_METAL_PROBES`. Do not tie production diagnostics to `DEBUG`.
- Prefer probes at fragment boundaries, dispatch-entry routing boundaries, hidden/logits transfer points, and sampling entry points so corruption can be localized quickly.
- Add a narrow regression test for every bug that crosses a layer boundary:
  - fragment contract test
  - optimizer-independence test
  - buffer ownership or residency test
  - real-model output test if the bug escaped unit coverage

## Module Structure

The repository is intentionally split into Core AI layers and a preserved direct
Metal compatibility layer.

- `LMIR`
  - Backend-independent data model.
  - Defines `ModelGraph`, `Region`, `Operation`, `OperationKind`, `OperationAttributes`, `ParameterBinding`, `ModelConfig`.
  - Normalizes Hugging Face `config.json` metadata through the shared
    `HuggingFaceConfigDecoder`.
  - Contains no Metal code and no DSL knowledge.

- `LMArchitecture`
  - Declarative model DSL and validation layer.
  - Defines `ModelComponent`, `PrimitiveComponent`, structural components such as `Residual`, `Parallel`, `Repeat`, `LayerStack`.
  - Normalizes model declarations into `LMIR.ModelGraph`.

- `ModelDeclarations`
  - Product/model-family declarations built on `LMArchitecture`.
  - Current declarations include `Transformer`, `Qwen35`, `LFM2`, and `Cohere`.
  - `ModelFamilyRegistry` is the shared graph and weight-naming routing point.
  - This layer decides which computation graph to build from `ModelConfig`.

- `CoreAIExport`
  - Validates normalized graphs and emits a versioned, backend-neutral Core AI
    export document with explicit parameter bindings.

- `SwiftLMCoreAI`
  - Validates `.aimodel` assets, specializes `AIModel` instances, and executes
    low-level `InferenceFunction` calls. Dynamic state descriptors require
    explicit resolved shapes at session creation; dynamic outputs require
    explicit shapes for each call.

- `SwiftLMFoundationModels`
  - Adapts Apple's `CoreAILanguageModels` package for supported language bundles.

- `SwiftLMIR`
  - Converts local HuggingFace `config.json` metadata into a Core AI export
    document using the declarative model declarations.

- `python/`
  - Validates Swift export documents and invokes Apple's official Core AI
    exporter or low-level Torch converter.

- `MetalCompiler`
  - Direct Metal backend for `LMIR`, retained for the 0.10 compatibility path.
  - Walks IR, lowers primitive attributes into fragment trees, runs dispatch optimization, compiles kernels, allocates buffers, and produces an opaque `MetalCompiledModel` containing decode/prefill runtime state.
  - Also owns STAF, safetensors conversion/loading, weight naming resolution, and execution-side buffer formats.

- `SwiftLM`
  - Direct Metal compatibility API for loading, tokenization, prompt formatting,
    and generation.
  - `ModelBundleLoader` is the main loader.
  - `LanguageModelContainer` is the primary public entry point for language generation.
  - `LanguageModelContext` exposes mutable runtime state, prompt staging, prompt snapshots, and cache control.
  - `TextEmbeddingContainer` is the primary public entry point for text embeddings.
  - `TextEmbeddingContext` exposes mutable runtime state for reusable embedding execution.

Dependency direction:

```text
LMIR  ←──  LMArchitecture  ←──  ModelDeclarations
  │                                     │
  ├──────  CoreAIExport  ──── SwiftLMIR
  │             │
  │             ├──────────── SwiftLMCoreAI
  │             └──────────── SwiftLMFoundationModels
  │
  └──────  MetalCompiler  ─── SwiftLM (0.10 compatibility)
```

Rules:

- `LMArchitecture` must not depend on `MetalCompiler`.
- `MetalCompiler` must not depend on `LMArchitecture`; both meet at `LMIR`.
- Backend-specific behavior belongs in backend layers by extending IR attribute types, not by leaking backend details into `LMIR`.

## Runtime Data Flow

Core AI export path:

```text
HF bundle/config.json
  ├─ ConfigDecoder              → ModelConfig
  ├─ model declaration          → ModelGraph
  ├─ ParameterResolver          → parameter bindings
  ├─ CoreAIModelExporter        → CoreAIExportDocument
  ├─ swiftlm-coreai             → Apple Core AI exporter
  └─ .aimodel                   → AIModel / CoreAILanguageModel
```

The legacy direct Metal path additionally converts safetensors to STAF, builds
decode/prefill plans, and exposes `LanguageModelContainer`. Keep that path
isolated from Core AI export contracts.

GenerationEvent path:

```text
ModelInput
  ├─ await context.prepare(...)               → PreparedPrompt
  ├─ ExecutablePrompt(preparedPrompt:using:)  → ExecutablePrompt
  ├─ context.generate(from:...)               → prefill + decode stream
  └─ PromptSnapshot(from:using:)              → reusable prefixed state
```

## Design Principles

### 1. IR is semantic, not backend-specific

`LMIR` describes graph structure and value flow, not execution details.

- `OperationAttributes` are opaque to the IR.
- Backends interpret the same IR attributes through protocol conformances and lowering logic.
- Do not add Metal-only fields to `LMIR` types just because the current backend needs them.

### 2. Model declarations describe families, not execution tricks

`ModelDeclarations` should express the computation graph in family-level terms:

- `Attention`
- `MLP`
- `MoE`
- `DeltaNet`
- `ShortConv`
- `RMSNorm` / `LayerNorm`

Do not encode backend shortcuts or weight-layout assumptions in the declaration layer.

### 3. Missing required config is an error

`ModelConfig` is the normalized input contract for graph construction.

- If a model family requires metadata, validate it and throw.
- Do not silently invent defaults for runtime-critical fields.
- Distinguish clearly between:
  - true architectural defaults
  - derived values
  - missing metadata

### 4. safetensors is canonical, STAF is executable cache

The source of truth is the HuggingFace safetensors bundle.

- STAF is a regenerable cache optimized for GPU execution.
- Conversion bugs should be fixed by improving the converter or loader, not by making STAF authoritative.
- Do not add design assumptions that require STAF to become the canonical storage format.

### 5. Decode hot path matters more than convenience abstractions

The current product center is Core AI asset generation and execution on Apple
platforms. Direct Metal decode performance remains important only for the 0.10
compatibility path.

Prefer changes that improve:

- native execution of packed/quantized weights
- lower decode overhead per token
- safe reuse of KV and convolution state
- fused or batched execution for MoE / DeltaNet / hybrid models

Avoid designs that:

- dequantize large weight sets eagerly into dense temporary buffers on the hot path
- add Swift-side per-token graph walking or dynamic branching
- move runtime-critical work from GPU kernels into host loops

### 6. HuggingFace references are authoritative

Treat HuggingFace `modeling_*.py` `forward()` implementations as the source of
truth for model behavior.

- Validate each model family independently. Do not copy assumptions across
  Gemma, Qwen, LFM2, Cohere, or other families without checking the actual
  reference implementation.
- For new support or bug work, obtain Python-side reference values first, then
  compare `swift-lm` intermediates against those values before patching.
- Do not assume existing `swift-lm` code or tests are correct until they have
  been compared against the HuggingFace reference.
- Keep all model computation on the intended path:
  `ModelComponent -> LMIR -> CoreAIExport -> Core AI`. Do not add a pure Swift
  CPU fallback for production model math. The legacy path is
  `ModelComponent -> LMIR -> MetalCompiler -> Metal GPU`.

## Model Family Boundary

Treat architecture concepts as reusable families and keep product names local to model declarations.

Family-level concepts:

- `Transformer`
- `MoE`
- `DeltaNet`
- `ShortConv`
- `parallel attention + MLP`
- state-space / recurrent layers

Product/model names:

- `Qwen35`
- `LFM2`
- `Cohere`
- `Llama`
- `Gemma`
- `Mixtral`

Repository rules:

- `Sources/LMArchitecture/**` should contain family-level building blocks only.
- `Sources/LMIR/**` should remain product-agnostic.
- `Sources/Models/**` may contain model/product-specific declarations.
- `Sources/MetalCompiler/**` may contain backend-specific lowering and kernels, but family names are still preferred over product names unless the behavior is truly product-specific.

When adding support for a new model:

1. Identify whether it fits an existing family.
2. If not, add the missing family-level component or IR contract first.
3. Enumerate required config fields in `ModelConfig` and validate them explicitly.
4. Only then add the product-specific declaration in `Sources/Models/**`.

## Current Supported Declaration Families

These are the major declaration paths visible in the repository today.

- `Transformer`
  - Standard pre-norm decoder transformer.
  - Covers dense and MoE variants when the graph shape is still transformer-compatible.

- `Qwen35`
  - Hybrid DeltaNet + full-attention stack.
  - Uses explicit scheduling and hybrid-only config fields such as partial rotary and state-space head dimensions.

- `LFM2`
  - Hybrid short-convolution + attention stack.
  - Supports dense and MoE variants, per-layer schedules, and Core AI mutable
    KV/convolution state export from config.

- `Cohere`
  - Transformer variant with LayerNorm and QK normalization.

## Public API Notes

Current `SwiftLM` public API is intentionally thin.

- `ModelBundleLoader.load(repo:)` and `load(directory:)` return a `LanguageModelContainer`.
- `ModelBundleLoader.loadTextEmbeddings(repo:)` and `loadTextEmbeddings(directory:)` return a `TextEmbeddingContainer`.
- `LanguageModelContainer` is the primary public entry point for language generation.
- `LanguageModelContext` is the mutable runtime state for explicit context ownership, prompt snapshots, or staged execution.
- `TextEmbeddingContainer` is the primary public entry point for text embeddings.
- `TextEmbeddingContext` is the mutable runtime state for explicit embedding-context ownership.
- `ModelInput` is the primary public request value for language-model APIs.
- `TextEmbeddingInput` is the primary public request value for embedding APIs.
- `PromptPreparationOptions` holds prompt/render-time configuration only.
- `GenerationParameters` holds generation/output-time configuration only.
- `PreparedPrompt` carries rendered prompt text, token IDs, and optional multimodal prompt metadata.
- `ExecutablePrompt` carries the validated runtime input accepted by the current Metal execution path, including Qwen-style multimodal execution payloads when supported by the loaded bundle.

Public API design rules:

- Prefer `Container -> Context` as the top-level shape of the API.
- Use the container as the recommended entry point for most app code.
- Use the context when the caller explicitly needs mutable runtime ownership.
- Prefer request-value types over parallel argument lists.
  - language generation uses `ModelInput`
  - embeddings use `TextEmbeddingInput`
- Keep prompt/render-time options separate from generation-time options.
  - prompt/template controls belong in `PromptPreparationOptions`
  - sampling and output controls belong in `GenerationParameters`
- Keep staged APIs available, but treat them as advanced APIs.
  - `PreparedPrompt` and `ExecutablePrompt` are not the default path
  - one-shot container APIs should remain the easiest path to use
- When adding new options, first decide whether they are:
  - structural request data
  - prompt/render-time options
  - generation/output-time options
  - advanced staged/runtime-only details
- Do not add public APIs that leak backend-specific Metal execution details into `SwiftLM`.
- Keep language-model APIs and embedding APIs directionally aligned unless there is a clear reason not to.

Do not reintroduce stale assumptions from older designs:

- no GGUF loader types
- no MLX execution engine
- no `InferenceSession`
- no async `preparePrefix`
- no `perform(values:operation:)`

If such functionality is reintroduced later, document it from the actual implementation rather than from prior repository history.

## Metal Backend Notes (0.10 Compatibility)

The preserved 0.10 backend is direct Metal compute. Core AI is the primary
backend for new work; changes here must not leak legacy execution details into
Core AI products or the backend-independent IR.

- Decode uses a compiled dispatch plan with preallocated buffers.
- Prefill uses a separate sequence-oriented plan.
- `MetalInferenceModel` owns command queue execution and mutable decode position.
- Prefill and decode have different precision/buffering tradeoffs.

The repository also contains active design work for Metal 4 / MPP-based prefill improvements in [docs/design/metal4.md](/Users/1amageek/Desktop/swift-lm/docs/design/metal4.md). Treat that document as forward-looking design, not as a statement that the codebase has already switched to that implementation.

## Compiler and Fragment Contracts

- Bridge `OperationAttributes` to backend execution through
  `MetalCompilable` retroactive conformances in `MetalCompiler`. Do not make
  the compiler switch on model-specific attribute types.
- `MetalCompilable` must return an already-optimized fragment tree for its own
  component. Component-local optimizations such as Q/K/V batching or SwiGLU
  fusion belong there, not in a generic post-pass.
- Fragments are self-describing. Compiler code should rely on fragment
  contracts rather than handwritten special cases for concrete fragment types.
- Do not add handwritten `generateFused...` kernel generators when a fusion can
  be expressed by fragment contracts and synthesized kernel bodies.
- When adding a new primitive:
  1. add the IR attributes
  2. add the `MetalCompilable` conformance
  3. add a `PrimitiveMetalKernelFragment` only when needed
  4. declare `FusionContract` and `writeBufferIndices` precisely
- Runtime-critical settings such as `KVCacheSpecification.maximumSequenceLength`
  must not gain silent defaults.

## Vision and Multimodal Notes

- Qwen3.5 is a vision-language model, not a text-only model by default. Treat
  `model_type: "qwen3_5"` with `vision_config`, image/video token ids, and
  processor metadata as multimodal unless an explicit language-only mode is
  being implemented.
- Vision encoders and text decoders are separate graphs and should be modeled
  as such.
- For Gemma4 vision support:
  - derive the projection output dimension from `text_config.hidden_size`
  - resolve `processor_class` from processor or tokenizer config files
  - read vision RoPE theta from config instead of hardcoding it

## Metal 4 Priority

- Metal 4 is the primary target for new backend work when the deployment
  environment supports it.
- Prefer `MTL4CommandBuffer` and allocator reuse, stage-to-stage barriers, and
  argument tables before adding Metal 3-only machinery.
- Decode performance is dominated by dispatch and barrier overhead more than
  individual kernel math. Prioritize dispatch-count reduction and automatic
  fusion before micro-optimizing a single kernel.

## Testing Expectations

Use tests appropriate to the layer being changed.

- `ModelsTests`
  - graph construction validity
  - determinism
  - required metadata failures
  - family-specific structural expectations

- `SwiftLMTests`
  - loading pipeline
  - config decoding
  - safetensors/STAF integration
  - end-to-end graph construction and compile entry points
  - Qwen3.5+ multimodal coverage is split into focused suites:
    - `QwenVisionCapabilityTests`
    - `QwenVisionPromptProcessorTests`
    - `QwenVisionExecutionLayoutTests`
    - `QwenVisionEncoderTests`
    - `QwenVisionExecutionTests`
    - `QwenVisionIntegrationTests`
    - `QwenVisionRealBundleImageTests`
    - `QwenVisionRealBundleVideoTests`
    - `QwenVisionRealBundleMixedTests`
    - `QwenVisionRealBundlePromptStateTests` for optional local snapshot coverage

- `MetalCompilerTests`
  - lowering
  - source generation
  - dispatch planning
  - diagnostics
  - reference comparisons against Python dumps when available

For performance or correctness work on Metal execution:

- prefer focused target/test execution over full-suite runs
- for crash-prone real-bundle checks, prefer `xcodebuild build-for-testing` once and then `xcodebuild test-without-building` per test case
- for the Qwen3.5+ multimodal path, prefer the focused `SwiftLMTests` suites above over `-only-testing:SwiftLMTests`
- keep timeouts in mind
- when a test hangs, suspect cache/state completion, synchronization, or unfinished stream/state transitions before assuming the compiler is wrong
- if a real-model test crashes or exhausts memory, reduce scope further before changing code: one bundle, one suite, one case per process
- use `autoreleasepool` or tighter object lifetimes around repeated bundle loads and synchronous helper loops to avoid misleading crash signatures from retained GPU resources
- add small contract tests for fragments, routing, stride/layout, and ownership rules; do not rely only on end-to-end text assertions
- weak assertions such as `contains("tokyo")` are insufficient for correctness-sensitive regressions; prefer token IDs, exact prefix, or reference-aligned expectations where feasible

## Production Readiness Gates

Do not describe `swift-lm` as production-ready unless all of the following are true.

### 1. Output correctness is stable

- Major supported model families have focused real-model output tests.
- Reference-aligned or exact-prefix assertions exist for critical prompts.
- Output quality is confirmed before any benchmark result is treated as meaningful.
- Inference-policy differences (`none`, `standard`, `aggressive`, RotorQuant, fallback paths) are checked for behavioral equivalence where they should match.

### 2. Crash and memory behavior are understood

- Repeated model load / generate / reset / snapshot-restore loops have been exercised without xctest restarts or unexplained process exits.
- Heavy real-model tests are split into focused invocations to avoid false confidence from suite-level batching.
- Large synchronous helper loops use tight lifetimes and `autoreleasepool` boundaries where appropriate.
- Known crash-prone paths have probes or diagnostics that make the failure boundary obvious.

### 3. Performance is measured only after correctness

- Baseline benchmark numbers are recorded for representative models and policies.
- Regressions are judged on both total tok/s and decode tok/s.
- Benchmark diagnostics confirm that expected optimizer features remain active.
- Performance claims are not made from builds that have unresolved output-quality issues.

### 4. Public API direction is stable

- `Container -> Context` remains the top-level API shape.
- Request-value types remain the preferred public request shape.
- Prompt/render options remain separate from generation/output options.
- Advanced staged APIs remain available but are not the default recommended path.
- New public APIs are reviewed against these rules before being added.

### 5. Capability reporting is accurate

- `ModelConfiguration.inputCapabilities` and `executionCapabilities` reflect actual supported behavior.
- Unsupported modalities or template configurations fail with explicit errors.
- README, DocC, tests, and actual runtime behavior stay aligned.

### 6. Release process is repeatable

- Focused correctness suites and smoke benchmarks are runnable with documented commands.
- Supported-model notes and known limitations are updated for each release.
- A release should not be cut while correctness regressions, unexplained crashes, or broken focused suites remain open.

Recommended execution order for readiness work:

1. narrow contract tests
2. focused real-model correctness tests
3. policy / optimizer equivalence checks
4. smoke benchmarks
5. longer benchmarks and release validation

### Production Validation Matrix

Use the following matrix as the default readiness checklist. Prefer focused
`build-for-testing` once, then `test-without-building` per suite or per case.

- LFM2 / LFM2.5
  - declaration / graph validity
    - `ModelsTests/ModelDeclarationTests`
  - compiler / fragment / routing contracts
    - `MetalCompilerTests/ComponentDispatchTests`
    - `MetalCompilerTests/BarrierOptimizationTests`

Suggested command pattern:

1. `perl -e 'alarm shift; exec @ARGV' 120 xcodebuild build-for-testing -scheme swift-lm-Package -destination 'platform=macOS'`
2. `perl -e 'alarm shift; exec @ARGV' 120 xcodebuild test-without-building -scheme swift-lm-Package -destination 'platform=macOS' -only-testing:<Target>/<SuiteOrCase>`

When running release validation, do not batch multiple heavy real-bundle suites in
one test process. Run them one at a time and inspect the result before starting the
next suite.

### Readiness Tracking Rules

When reporting current readiness status, classify each area as exactly one of:

- `done`
- `partial`
- `missing`

Status rules:

- `done`
  - there is direct evidence from recent test or benchmark execution
  - the relevant focused suites or cases passed
  - no known open correctness or crash issue blocks the claim
- `partial`
  - some coverage or evidence exists, but not enough to make a production claim
  - local-asset-dependent suites were skipped or not all focused suites were run
  - performance data exists without complete correctness evidence, or vice versa
- `missing`
  - no current evidence exists
  - the required suite, benchmark, or real-bundle check has not been run
  - the area is still design-only or known-broken

Evidence rules:

- Do not mark an area `done` from code inspection alone.
- Do not mark an area `done` from benchmark numbers alone.
- Do not use passing unit tests to claim real-model correctness.
- Do not use a suite-level green result if the intended case did not actually run.
- If a real-bundle suite skips because assets are absent, record that as `partial`, not `done`.
- If output correctness is unresolved, benchmark evidence can only raise an area to `partial`.
- For thinking/reasoning models, do not accept tests that only assert non-empty
  reasoning. A release-valid E2E must also assert non-empty final answer text,
  expected answer content or reference-aligned token/prefix output, and no
  reasoning tags leaked into the answer.
- Validate each thinking-capable model family independently. Passing Qwen output
  does not prove LFM or Gemma output, and passing `generate` does not prove
  streaming.
- Stop release validation if streaming emits reasoning deltas but never emits a
  text delta, or if the accumulated answer is empty/whitespace-only.

Recommended reporting format:

- area
  - status: `done|partial|missing`
  - evidence: concrete suite or benchmark names
  - gap: the next missing check required to reach `done`

## Editing Guidance

When updating architecture support:

- start from `ModelConfig` and declaration requirements
- keep `ModelGraph` backend-independent
- keep naming resolution and weight-layout handling in `MetalCompiler`
- avoid leaking safetensors/STAF details into declaration code

When updating docs:

- prefer describing what the current code does, not what a predecessor repository used to do
- if a design doc is aspirational, mark it as such
- keep README, `AGENTS.md`, and `CLAUDE.md` aligned with `Package.swift` and the code under `Sources/**`
