# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a multi-service application called "ServiceNow Helper" that provides an AI-powered interface for ServiceNow assistance featuring **multi-agent AI architecture**. The entire system is containerized using Docker Compose.

The core components are:
- **Next.js 16.0.0 Frontend**: A web application for user interaction, authentication, and displaying results with agent model configuration, knowledge store management, and multimodal capabilities.
- **n8n Workflow Engine (1.118.2)**: Handles the backend AI processing with multi-agent support, integrating with services like Anthropic Claude.
- **PostgreSQL Database (15.x with pgvector 0.8.1)**: Provides data storage for n8n, session storage, agent model configurations, and knowledge store for the Next.js app.
- **ServiceNow Helper Companion App**: A ServiceNow application that facilitates integration using staging table architecture for secure data synchronization.

## Architecture

The application follows a containerized, multi-service architecture orchestrated by Docker Compose.

### Authentication System
- JWT-based authentication using httpOnly cookies.
- Auth middleware in `src/lib/auth-middleware.ts` verifies tokens server-side.
- `AuthContext` provides client-side authentication state management.

### API Integration & Data Flow (Multi-Agent Streaming Architecture)
1.  User submits a question via the `SearchInterface` in the Next.js app.
2.  The request is sent to `/api/submit-question-stream`, which is protected by JWT authentication and includes agent model configurations.
3.  The Next.js API establishes a **Server-Sent Events (SSE) streaming connection** to the n8n webhook with agent-specific model settings.
4.  **Real-time streaming**: Response chunks are streamed back immediately as n8n generates them using configured agent models (Orchestration, Business Rule, Client Script).
5.  The UI updates in real-time, displaying content as it streams, similar to ChatGPT/Claude interfaces.
6.  Enhanced cancellation system allows users to stop streaming requests at any time.
7.  **Script Deployment**: Users can deploy generated scripts directly to ServiceNow via `/api/send-script` endpoint, which uses the N8NClient server-side to communicate with N8N workflows.

### Settings System
- **User Settings Management**: Persistent user preferences stored in PostgreSQL database
- **Agent Model Configuration**: Individual AI model selection per specialized agent with expandable UI cards
- **AI Model Management**: Comprehensive AI model management with capabilities tracking (text, image, audio)
- **Settings Context**: React context providing settings state management and API integration
- **AgentModelContext**: Dedicated React context for multi-agent model state management
- **AIModelContext**: React context for AI model state and configuration management
- **ThemeContext**: Dark/light theme management with persistent user preferences

## UI Design Principles

This project follows a modern, cohesive design system with consistent styling across all components. **All UI changes must maintain this consistency.**

### Design System Standards

#### Chip-Style Buttons
- **Border Radius**: Use `rounded-full` for all primary and secondary buttons
- **Gradients**: Primary buttons use `bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-indigo-600` with hover states `hover:from-blue-600 hover:to-indigo-700`
- **Shadows**: Apply colored shadows with opacity variants: `shadow-md shadow-blue-500/25 hover:shadow-lg hover:shadow-blue-500/30`
- **Animations**: Always include `hover:scale-105 active:scale-95` for tactile feedback
- **Disabled States**: Use `disabled:from-gray-400 disabled:to-gray-400 disabled:hover:scale-100`
- **Font Weight**: Use `font-medium` for button text

#### Pill-Style Badges
- **Shape**: Use `rounded-full` for all badges and status indicators
- **Padding**: Apply `px-2.5 py-1` for consistent sizing
- **Typography**: Use `text-xs font-medium` for badge text
- **Colors**: Use semantic colors with dark mode variants (e.g., `bg-green-100 text-green-800 dark:bg-green-900/30 dark:text-green-400`)

#### Modern Cards & Containers
- **Border Radius**: Use `rounded-2xl` or `rounded-3xl` for cards
- **Glassmorphism**: Apply `bg-white/95 dark:bg-gray-800/95 backdrop-blur-xl` for semi-transparent backgrounds
- **Borders**: Use semi-transparent borders: `border border-gray-200/50 dark:border-gray-700/50`
- **Shadows**: Apply colored shadows for depth: `shadow-lg shadow-blue-500/5` or `shadow-2xl shadow-blue-500/10`
- **Hover Effects**: Cards should have `hover:shadow-xl hover:shadow-blue-500/10` transitions

#### Modal Overlays
- **Backdrop**: Use `backdrop-blur-md bg-black/40` for modal overlays
- **Animations**: Include `animate-in fade-in-0 duration-200` for overlay entrance
- **Modal Container**: Apply glassmorphism with `bg-white/95 dark:bg-gray-800/95 backdrop-blur-xl`
- **Modal Animation**: Use `animate-in slide-in-from-bottom-4 duration-300` for modal entrance

#### Interactive Elements
- **Scale Animations**: All clickable elements should have `hover:scale-110 active:scale-95` (small elements) or `hover:scale-105 active:scale-95` (buttons)
- **Transitions**: Use `transition-all duration-200` for smooth animations
- **Hover Backgrounds**: Apply `hover:bg-gray-100 dark:hover:bg-gray-700` for icon buttons
- **Icon Sizes**: Standard icon size is `w-5 h-5` for most UI elements, `w-4 h-4` for smaller contexts

#### Close Buttons
- **Styling**: Use `p-2 text-gray-400 hover:text-gray-600 dark:hover:text-gray-300 rounded-lg`
- **Animations**: Include `hover:scale-110 active:scale-95 hover:bg-gray-100 dark:hover:bg-gray-700`
- **Transitions**: Apply `transition-all duration-200`

#### Color System
- **Primary**: Blue-to-indigo gradients (`from-blue-500 to-indigo-600`)
- **Shadows**: Use opacity variants `/5`, `/10`, `/25`, `/30` for colored shadows
- **Borders**: Semi-transparent borders with `/50` opacity
- **Backgrounds**: Use `/95` opacity for glassmorphism effects

### Component-Specific Patterns

#### Forms & Inputs
- Use `border-2` for input borders to create stronger visual hierarchy
- Apply `focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-500 focus:border-transparent` for focus states
- Secondary buttons should have `border-2 border-gray-300 dark:border-gray-600`

#### Navigation & Menus
- Back buttons and navigation icons should have `hover:scale-110 active:scale-95`
- Menu items should include smooth hover backgrounds

#### Status Indicators
- Use pill-style badges with semantic colors
- Include appropriate icons from `lucide-react`

### Accessibility Requirements
- All interactive elements must have proper `aria-label` and `title` attributes
- Maintain color contrast ratios (WCAG AA minimum)
- Ensure keyboard navigation works with visible focus states
- Disabled states must be visually distinct and include `disabled:cursor-not-allowed`

### Dark Mode Support
- All components must support dark mode with appropriate `dark:` variants
- Use semantic color classes that work in both light and dark themes
- Test all UI changes in both light and dark modes

### Consistency Enforcement
When creating or modifying UI components:
1. **Reference existing components** (e.g., `AIModelModal`, `FilterModal`, `SendScriptModal`) as examples
2. **Apply all design patterns** listed above consistently
3. **Test hover states, animations, and transitions** thoroughly
4. **Verify dark mode** appearance
5. **Check accessibility** with keyboard navigation

## Documentation & Best Practices

### Context7 Tool for Latest Documentation
When working with libraries or frameworks, **use the Context7 tool (via MCP)** to access the latest documentation and best practice information. The Context7 tool provides:
- **Up-to-date documentation** for libraries like Next.js, React, TailwindCSS, TypeScript, and more
- **Code examples** and implementation patterns
- **Best practices** and recommended approaches
- **Version-specific information** to ensure compatibility

**Example usage**: Before implementing new features or making significant changes to existing libraries, use Context7 to:
1. Verify current best practices for the library version in use
2. Check for new features or patterns that might improve the implementation
3. Ensure compatibility with the project's tech stack
4. Access code examples for reference

This ensures that all code follows current best practices and takes advantage of the latest library features.

## Playwright Testing Best Practices

Based on Playwright documentation and successful test implementations:

### Key Principles
1. **Use Web-First Assertions**: Prefer `await expect(locator).toBeVisible()` over manual waits
2. **Prioritize User-Facing Selectors**: Use `getByRole()`, `getByText()`, and `getByPlaceholder()` over CSS selectors
3. **Handle Strict Mode**: When multiple elements match, use more specific selectors like `getByRole('button', { name: 'Text' })`
4. **Test User Behavior**: Focus on what users see and do, not implementation details

### React-Specific Considerations
- **State Updates**: React state may not update immediately with `fill()`. Use `dispatchEvent()` if needed
- **Form Submission**: Test actual user interactions (clicking buttons, pressing keys) rather than forcing form submission
- **Component Interactions**: Use semantic selectors that match how users interact with the interface

### Common Patterns
```javascript
// Good: Specific, user-facing selector
await expect(page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Get Help' })).toBeVisible();

// Good: Wait for authentication completion
await page.waitForFunction(() => !!document.querySelector('textarea'), { timeout: 10000 });

// Good: Web-first assertion with timeout
await expect(element).toBeEnabled({ timeout: 10000 });
```

### Testing Strategy
- Test authentication flows and basic UI interactions
- Verify interface elements are present and accessible
- Focus on user-visible behavior rather than internal state
- Use mocking for external API calls to ensure test reliability
