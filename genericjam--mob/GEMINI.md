# Mob — Agent Instructions

See [`guides/agentic_coding.md`](guides/agentic_coding.md) for a full guide on the
agent round-trip workflow: how to connect to the running Erlang node, when to use
`Mob.Test` vs MCP platform tools, and how to avoid the instinct to reach for
`xcrun simctl` screenshots.

## Standard debugging workflow

The preferred tool is `mix mob.connect` (from `mob_dev` package):

```bash
cd ~/code/mob_demo
mix mob.connect          # discover all devices, tunnel, restart, connect IEx
mix mob.connect --no-iex # same but print node names instead of starting IEx
mix mob.devices          # list connected devices and their status
```

Node names are platform-specific:
- iOS simulator:    `mob_demo_ios@127.0.0.1`
- Android emulator: `mob_demo_android@127.0.0.1`

### EPMD tunneling

iOS simulator shares the Mac's network stack — the iOS BEAM registers directly in
the Mac's EPMD on port 4369. No forwarding needed.

Android is a separate network namespace. `mob_dev` sets up adb tunnels automatically:

```
adb reverse tcp:4369 tcp:4369   # EPMD: device → Mac (Android BEAM registers in Mac EPMD)
adb forward tcp:9100 tcp:9100   # dist:  Mac → device
```

### Port assignment (handled by mob_dev)

Devices are assigned dist ports by index to avoid conflicts:
- Device 0 (Android): port 9100
- Device 1 (iOS sim): port 9101

iOS dist port is passed via `SIMCTL_CHILD_MOB_DIST_PORT` env var; `mob_beam.m` reads
`MOB_DIST_PORT` at startup. Android dist port is passed as an intent extra (`mob_dist_port`);
**`MainActivity.java` does NOT yet read this — multi-Android support is pending.**

Both iOS and Android end up registered in the same Mac EPMD. `mix mob.connect` sets
up all tunnels automatically.

## Day-to-day development loop

```bash
# Edit Elixir code, then:
mix mob.deploy          # compile + push BEAMs + restart apps
mix mob.connect         # tunnel + wait for nodes + drop into IEx

# In IEx (after mob.connect):
mix compile && nl(MobDemo.CounterScreen)   # hot-push one module without restart
Node.list()                                # verify both devices connected
:rpc.call(:"mob_demo_android@127.0.0.1", MobDemo.CounterScreen, :some_fn, [])
```

### Reading live screen state

```elixir
# Screen pid is logged at app start: "[mob] step 5 => {ok,<0.92.0>}"
pid = :rpc.call(:"mob_demo_android@127.0.0.1", :erlang, :list_to_pid, [~c"<0.92.0>"])
socket = :rpc.call(:"mob_demo_android@127.0.0.1", Mob.Screen, :get_socket, [pid])
socket.assigns   # live assigns
```

### Hot code push

```bash
# After editing a screen (from the terminal):
mix mob.push          # compile + push all changed modules to all connected devices
mix mob.push --all    # force-push every module

# Or from inside IEx (after mob.connect), one module at a time:
nl(MobDemo.CounterScreen)
# Returns: {:ok, [{:"mob_demo@127.0.0.1", :loaded, MobDemo.CounterScreen}]}
```

### Android distribution

Android cannot start distribution at BEAM launch (races with hwui thread pool, causes
SIGABRT via FORTIFY `pthread_mutex_lock on destroyed mutex`). Instead, `Mob.Dist.ensure_started/1`
defers `Node.start/2` by 3 seconds after app startup. This is handled in the mob library —
app code just calls `Mob.Dist.ensure_started(node: :"my_app_android@127.0.0.1", cookie: :my_secret)`.

ERTS helper binaries (`erl_child_setup`, `inet_gethost`, `epmd`) cannot be exec'd from the
app data directory (SELinux `app_data_file` blocks `execute_no_trans`). They are packaged in
the APK as `lib*.so` in `jniLibs/arm64-v8a/` (gets `apk_data_file` label, which allows exec).
`mob_beam.c` symlinks `BINDIR/<name>` → `<nativeLibraryDir>/lib<name>.so` before `erl_start`.

## Agent round-trip workflow

The standard loop for AI-assisted feature development or debugging. Use all three
layers in order — BEAM state first, then visual verification only when needed.

### 1. Edit and deploy

```bash
mix mob.push            # compile + push changed BEAMs to all connected nodes
# or for a native rebuild (e.g. after NIF or Swift/Kotlin change):
mix mob.deploy --native
```

### 2. Inspect BEAM state via IEx or Mob.Test

Connect (or use an already-open IEx session from `mix mob.connect`):

```bash
mix mob.connect --no-iex   # sets up tunnels, prints node names, exits
```

Then from a separate IEx session or script:

```elixir
node = :"mob_demo_ios@127.0.0.1"
Mob.Test.screen(node)    # which screen is showing?
Mob.Test.assigns(node)   # live assigns — count, selected items, etc.
Mob.Test.tap(node, :some_button)   # drive a tap programmatically
Mob.Test.find(node, "Submit")      # locate a widget by visible text
```

This is the fastest path. BEAM state is exact and doesn't require image decoding.

### 3. Visual verification via MCP tools

When you need to confirm rendering, layout, or animations — use the platform MCP
servers. These are available as tools in the agent environment.

**iOS Simulator** (`mcp__ios-simulator__*`):

| Tool | When to use |
|------|-------------|
| `screenshot` | Capture the current simulator frame |
| `ui_tap` | Tap at x,y coordinates |
| `ui_type` | Type text into focused input |
| `ui_swipe` | Swipe gesture |
| `ui_view` | Inspect the accessibility tree |
| `ui_describe_point` | What element is at this coordinate? |
| `ui_describe_all` | Full accessibility dump |
| `record_video` / `stop_recording` | Record an interaction sequence |

**Android** (`mcp__adb__*`):

| Tool | When to use |
|------|-------------|
| `dump_image` | Screenshot from the connected device/emulator |
| `inspect_ui` | XML accessibility dump of the current view |
| `adb_shell` | Run arbitrary shell commands on the device |
| `adb_logcat` | Tail logcat (Elixir logs appear under the `Elixir` tag) |

### Typical round-trip

```
1. Edit Elixir code
2. mix mob.push
3. Mob.Test.screen(node)   ← confirm navigation / state
4. mcp__ios-simulator__screenshot  ← visual sanity check
5. Mob.Test.tap(node, :button)     ← drive interaction
6. Mob.Test.assigns(node)  ← confirm state updated correctly
7. repeat
```

Use `Mob.Test` for assertions (exact, fast, no image parsing). Use MCP screenshot/UI
tools for layout checks, animation spot-checks, or when a bug is only visible
in the rendered output.

## Device automation with Mob.Test

After connecting via `mix mob.connect`, use `Mob.Test` to inspect and drive the
running app without touching the native UI. Prefer this over screenshot-based
inspection — it gives exact state, not a visual approximation.

```elixir
node = :"mob_demo_ios@127.0.0.1"   # or mob_demo_android@127.0.0.1

# What screen is showing and what state is it in?
Mob.Test.screen(node)    #=> MobDemo.NavScreen
Mob.Test.assigns(node)   #=> %{depth: 0, safe_area: %{top: 62.0, ...}}

# Find a node by visible text
Mob.Test.find(node, "Device APIs")
#=> [{[0, 0, 9], %{"type" => "button", ...}}]

# Trigger a tap by the tag atom used in on_tap: {self(), tag}
Mob.Test.tap(node, :open_device)

# Full snapshot for debugging
Mob.Test.inspect(node)
# %{screen: MobDemo.NavScreen, assigns: ..., nav_history: [...], tree: ...}
```

Tag atoms come from `on_tap: {self(), :tag_atom}` in the render tree. Check the
screen's `render/1` to find them. After a tap, call `Mob.Test.screen/1` again to
confirm the navigation happened.

## Running tests

```bash
mix test          # from ~/code/mob
```

### Onboarding integration tests

The `test/onboarding/` suite verifies the full first-run flow end-to-end: archive
install, project generation, `mix mob.install`, `mix mob.doctor`, and failure modes.
These tests are **excluded from `mix test` by default** (they take minutes and require
Hex/network access). Run them explicitly:

```bash
# Fast subset — no simulator needed (~3 min, suitable for PR gating)
MIX_ENV=test mix test --only generator

# Failure-mode checks — no simulator needed (~2 min)
MIX_ENV=test mix test --only pre_device

# Everything above in one pass
MIX_ENV=test mix test --only onboarding

# Full suite including post-device tests (requires a booted iOS simulator)
MIX_ENV=test mix test --only failure_modes
```

Run one file at a time with `--max-cases 1` to avoid workspace ID collisions between
concurrent tests:

```bash
MIX_ENV=test mix test test/onboarding/generator_test.exs --only generator --max-cases 1
MIX_ENV=test mix test test/onboarding/failure_modes_test.exs --only pre_device --max-cases 1
```

**What they test:**

| Tag | File | Covers |
|-----|------|--------|
| `:generator` | `generator_test.exs` | Archive install, `mix mob.new`, `mix mob.install`, `mix mob.doctor` |
| `:pre_device` | `failure_modes_test.exs` | Failure modes that don't need a running simulator |
| `:post_device` | `failure_modes_test.exs` | Failures requiring a live iOS simulator |

**Preserved workspaces:** When a test fails, its workspace is kept at
`/tmp/mob_onboarding/run_<PID>/<test_id>/`. Inspect `logs/` for per-step output.
Workspaces from passing tests are deleted automatically.

**Known limitations (published `mob_dev 0.1.7`):**

- `MOB_OTP_BASE_URL` is not respected — OTP download URL cannot be overridden for
  failure injection. Network failure tests verify OTP reporting format instead.
- `check_elixir` reads `System.version()` (the running BEAM) — PATH-based fake Elixir
  versions have no effect. The Elixir version test verifies the check produces clear output.
- `check_java` ignores exit code (`{out, _}` pattern) — a fake java always shows ✓.
  The java test verifies the check is present and reports useful version info.
- `xcrun` and `java` share `/usr/bin` with `dirname`/`basename` used by mise/asdf elixir
  launcher scripts. Filtering `/usr/bin` from PATH crashes the subprocess. Tests for these
  tools verify the success path format instead of injecting a missing-tool failure.

## Common pitfalls

See [`common_fixes.md`](common_fixes.md) for a running log of diagnosed bugs and their
fixes — consult it first when hitting silent crashes or unexpected BEAM behavior.

## User issues log

See [`user_issues.md`](user_issues.md) for a record of real issues encountered by
beta users, their root causes, and fixes applied. Read this before working on setup,
deployment, or tooling problems — the same issues recur, especially for Nix users.
User alias "Nova" = macOS + Nix-managed toolchain throughout.
