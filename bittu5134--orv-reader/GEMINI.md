## Formatting Rules to Enforce

### Required Tags and Their Proper Usage

1. **Chapter Title** - `<title>`
   - Must be the first line of every chapter
   - Example: `<title>Ch 1: Prologue - Three Ways to Survive in a Ruined World.`

2. **Cover Image** - `<cover>`
   - Format: `<cover>[image_filename][description]`
   - Should appear right after the title (if present)
   - Example: `<cover>[Cover Part 1.jpg][]`

3. **System Messages** - `<!>`
   - For game system notifications, skill activations, status updates
   - Example: `<!>[Exclusive skill 'Fourth Wall' has been activated!]`

4. **System Windows** - `+`
   - Use `+` on lines before and after content
   - Add `[Title]` on first line inside for window titles (optional)
   - Example:
     ```
     +
     [Character Information]
     Name: Kim Dokja
     Level: 10
     +
     ```

5. **Constellation Speech** - `<@>`
   - For dialogue from constellations, dokkaibe, transcendents
   - Example: `<@>[The Demon King of Salvation is watching you]`

6. **Outer God Speech** - `<#>`
   - For dialogue from outer gods (Secretive Plotter, etc.)
   - Example: `<#>【The void whispers in your mind.】`

7. **Quotes** - `<&>`
   - For quoted text or special narration
   - Use `<br>` for line breaks within quotes
   - Example: `<&>「To the Breaking the Sky Sword, the First Murim was home.」`

8. **Translator Notes** - `<?>`
   - For explanatory notes about Korean words, cultural references
   - Example: `<?>Dokja can mean 'only child', 'reader', or 'individualist' in Korean.`

9. **Images** - `<img>`
   - Format: `<img>[image_filename][alt_text]`
   - Image must exist in `website/assets/images/`
   - Example: `<img>[Ch00-20 Cover.jpg][Illustration]`

10. **Section Breaks** - `***`
    - Horizontal line separator for scene breaks or chapter endings
    - Should have blank lines before and after
    - Example:
      ```
      
      ***
      
      ```

### Common Formatting Mistakes to Watch For

- **Missing chapter title tag**: Every chapter must start with `<title>`
- **Incorrect tag capitalization**: Tags are case-sensitive (e.g., `<!>` not `<! >` or `<l>`)
- **Missing brackets**: Tags like `<!>`, `<@>`, `<#>` require square brackets for content
- **Improper system window format**: Must have `+` on separate lines
- **Wrong tag for dialogue type**: Constellation vs. Outer God speech distinction
- **Extra spaces in tags**: `<!>` not `< !>` or `<! >`
- **Missing blank lines**: Around section breaks (`***`)
- **HTML in text files**: Contributors should not edit HTML directly

## Actively Fixing Tag and Bracket Issues

**IMPORTANT**: When you identify incorrect tag usage or bracket formatting, **always suggest the specific fix** in your review comments.

### How to Identify and Fix Wrong Tag Assignments

Different types of dialogue and content require specific tags. Here's how to identify and correct misuse:

#### 1. System Messages (`<!>`)
**Use for**: Game system notifications, skill activations, status windows, scenario announcements

**Common mistakes**:
- Using plain text for system messages
- Using `<@>` for system notifications
- Missing square brackets `[]`

**Fix examples**:
```diff
Wrong:
- [The Fourth Wall skill has been activated]
- <@>[You have completed the scenario]

Correct:
+ <!>[The Fourth Wall skill has been activated]
+ <!>[You have completed the scenario]
```

#### 2. Constellation Speech (`<@>`)
**Use for**: Direct speech from constellations, dokkaibe, transcendents

**Common mistakes**:
- Using `<!>` for constellation dialogue
- Using plain text or quotes for constellation speech
- Confusing with outer god speech

**Fix examples**:
```diff
Wrong:
- <!>[The Demon King of Salvation is watching you]
- The constellation said "I'm impressed by your choice"
- <#>[A certain constellation is amused]

Correct:
+ <@>[The Demon King of Salvation is watching you]
+ The constellation said,
+ <@>[I'm impressed by your choice]
+ <@>[A certain constellation is amused]
```

#### 3. Outer God Speech (`<#>`)
**Use for**: Speech from outer gods (Secretive Plotter, etc.)

**Common mistakes**:
- Using `<@>` for outer god dialogue
- Not using the proper brackets 【】

**Fix examples**:
```diff
Wrong:
- <@>[The Secretive Plotter is watching]
- <#>[The void speaks]

Correct:
+ <#>【The Secretive Plotter is watching】
+ <#>【The void speaks】
```

#### 4. Quotes and Special Text (`<&>`)
**Use for**: Quoted text from books, special narration, epigraphs

**Common mistakes**:
- Using for regular dialogue
- Using for constellation or outer god speech

**Fix examples**:
```diff
Wrong:
- <&>[The constellation speaks]
- Regular narration text formatted as quote

Correct:
+ <&>「Three Ways to Survive in a Ruined World」
+ <&>「To the Breaking the Sky Sword, the First Murim was home.」
```

### Bracket Formatting Rules

Each tag type has specific bracket requirements:

| Tag | Required Brackets | Example |
|-----|-------------------|---------|
| `<!>` | Square `[]` | `<!>[Skill activated!]` |
| `<@>` | Square `[]` | `<@>[Constellation message]` |
| `<#>` | Corner 【】 | `<#>【Outer god message】` |
| `<&>` | Corner 「」 | `<&>「Quote text」` |
| `<?>` | None (text follows directly) | `<?>Translation note` |
| `<img>` | Square `[][]` (two sets) | `<img>[file.jpg][Alt text]` |
| `<cover>` | Square `[][]` (two sets) | `<cover>[file.jpg][Description]` |

**Common bracket mistakes and fixes**:

```diff
Wrong - Missing brackets:
- <!>Skill activated

Correct:
+ <!>[Skill activated]

Wrong - Wrong bracket type:
- <#>[Outer god speaks]
- <&>[Quote text]

Correct:
+ <#>【Outer god speaks】
+ <&>「Quote text」

Wrong - Extra spaces:
- <!> [Message]
- <@>[ Message ]

Correct:
+ <!>[Message]
+ <@>[Message]

Wrong - Missing second bracket set for images:
- <img>[filename.jpg]

Correct:
+ <img>[filename.jpg][Description]
```

### When Suggesting Fixes

Always provide:
1. **Specific line reference** where the issue occurs
2. **What's wrong** with the current tag usage
3. **The exact corrected text** to use
4. **Brief explanation** of why this tag is correct

**Example review comment**:
> Line 45: This system notification should use the `<!>` tag instead of `<@>` because it's a game system message, not constellation speech.
> 
> Suggested fix:
> ```
> <!>[Exclusive skill 'Fourth Wall' has been activated!]
> ```

## Content Quality Guidelines

### What to Review

1. **Spelling and Grammar**
   - Check for typos, misspellings, and grammatical errors
   - Maintain consistency in character names and terminology
   - Watch for common mistakes: "its/it's", "your/you're", "there/their/they're"

2. **Character Names and Terms**
   - Ensure consistency in character name spelling
   - Verify Korean names are romanized consistently
   - Check that skill names, scenario titles match established canon

3. **Narrative Flow**
   - Ensure paragraphs are properly separated with blank lines
   - Check that dialogue is clear and properly attributed
   - Verify that scene transitions are smooth

4. **Tag Appropriateness**
   - System messages should only be used for actual game system text
   - Constellation speech should be reserved for when constellations speak directly
   - Quotes should be used for emphasis or special narration, not regular dialogue

### What NOT to Change

- **Story content**: Don't alter the actual story, plot, or dialogue unless fixing obvious typos
- **Translation choices**: Don't change translation unless there's a clear error
- **Existing working chapters**: Don't modify unrelated chapters
- **HTML files**: Only `.txt` chapter files should be edited

## Review Comment Style

When providing feedback, use a **supportive editorial tone**:

### Good Comment Examples

✅ **With specific fix**: "Line 23: This system notification should use the `<!>` tag. Suggested fix: `<!>[Exclusive skill 'Fourth Wall' has been activated!]`"

✅ **Identifying tag confusion**: "Line 67: This is constellation speech, not a system message. Change `<!>[The Demon King watches]` to `<@>[The Demon King watches]`"

✅ **Bracket correction**: "Line 89: Outer god speech requires corner brackets 【】. Change `<#>[Message]` to `<#>【Message】`"

✅ **Complete fix suggestion**: "Line 15: Missing `<title>` tag at the beginning. Add: `<title>Ch 45: The Final Choice`"

✅ **Multiple issues**: "Line 102: Two issues - should use `<@>` for constellation speech and needs square brackets. Change `The constellation said "I'm watching"` to `<@>[I'm watching]`"

✅ **Bracket spacing**: "Line 34: Extra space in tag. Change `<!> [Message]` to `<!>[Message]`"

### Avoid These Comment Styles

❌ "This code is wrong." (Too technical - remember you're reviewing prose, not code)

❌ "Fix this." (Too abrupt - be helpful and explain why)

❌ "You didn't follow the guidelines." (Be specific about which guideline)

❌ Using code review terminology excessively (refactor, function, variable, etc.)
