# CLAUDE.md — Benchmark Runner

## What This Is

CLI tool that benchmarks Claude Code audit skills against each other amd/or a bare Claude  Code baseline/bare. Runs multiple iterations of each condition against real Solidity codebases, captures raw output, verifies execution integrity, and generates comparison reports with recall/FP scoring against ground truth.

## Setup Requirements

- Node 20+
- `claude` CLI installed (all LLM calls use the CLI binary via `child_process.spawn` — no Anthropic SDK)
- **Exclude `results/` and `workspaces/` from cloud sync** (Dropbox, iCloud, OneDrive). File sync during benchmark writes causes data corruption — see [Platform Limitations](docs/persisted-output-trap.md). Run `npm run setup` to create `.nosync` markers.

## Quickstart

```bash
# 0. First-time setup (creates .nosync markers for sync protection)
npm run setup

# 1. Run benchmark
npm run bench -- --codebases merkl-stripped --runs 3 --parallel

# 2. Analyze results (classify → cluster → validate → report)
npm run analyze

# 3. Read the results
cat summary.md

# 4. Management dashboard (optional, no LLM calls)
npm run dashboard
open dashboard.html
```

## How It Works

`npm run bench` runs the full matrix (all codebases x all conditions x N runs). **This is expensive** — prefer filtered runs during development.

1. Reads `config/bench.json`
2. Prepares workspaces (one per codebase × condition):
   - Each condition gets its own workspace: `workspaces/<codebase>__<conditionId>/`
   - Codebase files are **real copies** (not symlinks) from `datasets/`
   - A `CLAUDE.md` is written per workspace to block parent walk-up and deliver scope info
   - **Skill runs**: `.claude/commands/solidity-auditor/` installed with correct version + VERSION verified
   - **Bare runs**: no skill installed, just the codebase copy
3. For each `(codebase, condition, iteration)`:
   - Spawns `claude -p "<prompt>" --output-format stream-json --verbose` in the workspace cwd
   - All runs: `--dangerously-skip-permissions --setting-sources project,local`
   - Bare runs add `--disable-slash-commands --disallowedTools Skill`
   - 10-minute timeout with grace-kill (15s after `result` event → SIGTERM → SIGKILL)
   - Captures 4 files per run
4. Post-run verification: 12 automated checks per run
5. Cleans up all workspaces after suite completes

**Invalid run detection**: Skill runs that exit 0 but produce 0 findings or <500 chars stdout are marked `INVALID` and excluded from report averages. This catches corrupt runs (e.g., cloud sync inode detachment).

### Bench filters example

- `--codebases <id>` — filter to specific codebase(s): `canary`, `merkl`, `merkl-stripped`, `brix`, `ekubo`, `megapot`, `panoptic`, `nft-dealers`
- `--conditions <id>` — filter to specific condition(s): `bare_audit`, `pashov`, `darknavy` (or any installed skill)
- `--runs <N>` — override number of iterations per condition (default: 1)
- `--model <model>` — override Claude model
- `--dry-run` — preview without spawning claude
- `--parallel` — run all codebase × condition pairs concurrently per iteration

### Conditions explained

| Condition | What it does |
|---|---|
| `bare_audit` | Raw Claude with a security audit prompt, no skills, no user config |
| `pashov` | Pashov's solidity-auditor skill — multi-agent with vector-scan + adversarial |
| `darknavy` | DarkNavy's contract-auditor skill — 4 hunt agents + adversarial validation |

Conditions are config-driven via `config/bench.json`. Add/remove skills with `npm run add-skill` / `npm run remove-skill`.

## Classification Pipeline

The analysis pipeline (`npm run analyze`) runs 3 steps:

### Step 1: Classify (with GT only)
- For each finding, calls Sonnet with the same classification prompt — configurable Nx vote via `CLASSIFY_VOTES` (default 1 for fast iteration, use 3 for production reliability)
- Takes majority vote: agreement labels are dynamic (e.g. `3/3`, `2/3`, `1/1`, `4/5`) based on actual vote count
- `uncertain` findings are preserved (not defaulted to FP) and flow into clustering
- Categories: `matched`, `novel`, `fp`, `uncertain`
- Deduplicates GT matches (highest agreement wins)
- Cached by `sha256(gtContent + stdoutContent + promptTemplate)` — prompt changes auto-invalidate cache
- Records `votesPerFinding` in output for reproducibility

### Step 2: Cluster
- Groups novel + uncertain findings (GT mode) or ALL findings (no-GT mode) by root cause
- Two clustering paths:
  - **Incremental (default):** new findings matched against existing clusters in batches of 5. Existing clusters stay stable.
  - **Full (--force or first run):** all findings clustered from scratch in chunks of ≤15 for reliable LLM responses.
- Content-based cluster IDs (SHA-256 of title + reasoning) for stability
- Stale foundIn entries pruned when findings are reclassified (novel→matched); empty clusters dropped
- Cached by content hash (inputs + model + scoping option) — no mtime, model changes auto-invalidate
- No-GT mode uses parser-extracted descriptions for richer clustering context

### Step 3: Validate
- Per cluster: Opus examines **scoped** source code (only files referenced by finding locations)
- Falls back to scope.txt, then all .sol files
- Three verdicts: confirmed, plausible, rejected
- Risk categorization: each confirmed/plausible finding tagged with `riskCategory` (`centralization-risk`, `informational`, or absent for real vulnerabilities)
- Dashboard and report can filter by risk category — data is preserved, display is filtered
- Cached by content hash (cluster file + validator model) — model changes auto-invalidate

### Report
- Management comparison table (one column per condition)
- Missed GT findings section (bugs missed by ALL conditions — prominent, not buried)
- Findings ledger (GT matches, confirmed novels, plausible, FP, rejected)
- 1 LLM narrative with deterministic number verification
- Data appendix (recall charts, classification breakdown, findings matrix, consistency)

## Reading the Report

The generated `summary.md` uses specific notation:

| Notation | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| `✓` | Finding detected in all runs of that condition |
| `✓#N` | Finding detected only in run N (not consistent) |
| `✓#1#2` | Finding detected in runs 1 and 2 but not others |
| `~~rejected~~` | Opus validation rejected the finding as not a real bug |
| `INVALID` | Run excluded from averages (0 findings from skill, likely corrupt) |

**Agreement labels** in classification data: `1/1` = single vote, `2/3` = majority of 3 votes, `3/3` = unanimous, `no-majority` = uncertain (no consensus across 3 votes).

## Verification

Every run is verified automatically by `src/runner/verify.ts` with 12 checks:

- **Process**: exit code (0 or 143), timeout detection, event stream non-empty, result event present
- **Skill runs**: agent spawn count (V1 ≥4, V2 ≥5), all agents returned, no agent errors, result quality (≥10 lines), bundle quality
- **Bare runs**: no skill contamination (skill not in init event's slash_commands)
- **Scope**: out-of-scope contracts not in findings, in-scope files were read
- **Diagnostics**: tool errors collected, session restarts detected

## Parser

`src/shared/parser.ts` extracts findings from audit output in multiple formats:

- **Skill format**: `[confidence] **N. Title**` with `` `Contract.function` · Confidence: N ``
- **Bare formats** (7 variants): `### [SEVERITY] Title`, `### H-1: Title`, `### [H-1] Title`, `### N. Title — **SEVERITY**`, `### N. Title (Severity)`, `**N. [SEVERITY] Title**`, `### N. Title` (severity from section header)

Each finding gets a location (`Contract.function`), vulnerability classification, description body (~300 chars), and root-cause key for cross-run comparison.

When the regex parser misses findings (detected via `extractUnmatchedBlocks`), an LLM fallback call recovers them during classification (uses LLMProvider, testable with fakes).

## Adding a Skill Version

1. Copy `solidity-auditor/` dir from the skills repo at the target commit into `skills_versions/<version>/solidity-auditor/`
2. Create `skills_versions/<version>/source.json` with `{ repo, commit, tag, snapshotDate }`
3. Add a condition in `config/bench.json` referencing the version

## Adding a Codebase

1. Add as git submodule: `git submodule add <repo-url> datasets/<id>`
2. Add entry to `config/bench.json` codebases array
3. (Optional) Add `datasets/<id>/scope.txt` and `datasets/<id>/out_of_scope.txt`
4. (Optional) Add ground truth: `ground_truth/<id>.json`

## Ground Truth

Files in `ground_truth/<codebaseId>.json` define known bugs from official C4 audit reports. When present, the analysis adds recall, precision, findings matrix, and missed-by-all counts. Official reports are in `ground_truth/reports/`.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| `CLASSIFIER_MODEL` | `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` | Finding classifier |
| `CLUSTER_MODEL` | `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` | Novel finding clusterer |
| `VALIDATOR_MODEL` | `claude-opus-4-6` | Novel finding validator |
| `ANALYST_MODEL` | `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` | Report narrative generator |
| `CLASSIFY_VOTES` | `1` | Votes per finding (1=fast, 3=reliable production) |
| `BENCH_TIMEOUT_MS` | `600000` | Runner process timeout |
| `CLASSIFY_CONCURRENCY` | `10` | Parallel classifier workers |
| `VALIDATE_CONCURRENCY` | `3` | Parallel validator workers |
| `CLUSTER_TIMEOUT_MS` | `180000` | Clustering timeout |
| `VALIDATOR_TIMEOUT_MS` | `180000` | Validation timeout |
| `ANALYST_TIMEOUT_MS` | `300000` | Analyst timeout |
| `LLM_RETRY_DELAY_MS` | `5000` | Delay between retries on transient failure |

## Isolation & Contamination Prevention

Multi-layered isolation prevents cross-condition contamination:

- **Workspace**: real file copies per (codebase, conditionId) — not symlinks
- **CLAUDE.md blocker**: workspace-level file prevents parent directory walk-up
- **Env vars**: `CLAUDE_CODE*` and `CLAUDECODE` stripped from child process (without this, `CLAUDE_CODE_SSE_PORT` makes spawned processes hang waiting for an IDE SSE connection)
- **Setting sources**: `--setting-sources project,local` excludes user-level settings
- **Bare hardening**: `--disable-slash-commands` + `--disallowedTools Skill` (double lock)
- **Canary strings**: injected into skill SKILL.md for contamination detection
- **VERSION verification**: installed skill version checked before each run

See [docs/isolation-and-contamination-prevention.md](docs/isolation-and-contamination-prevention.md) for full documentation.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Truncated/corrupt results files | Cloud sync (Dropbox, iCloud) renames files mid-write | Exclude `results/` and `workspaces/` from sync; run `npm run setup` |
| V2 timeouts on large codebases | Too many .sol files (e.g., panoptic has 92) | Reduce scope with `scope.txt` or increase `BENCH_TIMEOUT_MS` |
| Spawned `claude` process hangs | `CLAUDE_CODE_SSE_PORT` env var leaking to child | Env var stripping in runner handles this automatically |
| Empty LLM responses in pipeline | Transient CLI failures (~40% on some prompts) | Retry logic with `LLM_RETRY_DELAY_MS` handles this; update `claude` CLI |
| Stale classification cache | Changed classification prompt | Cache auto-invalidates (prompt hash in cache key since Phase 7) |
| `INVALID` runs in report | Skill run exited 0 but produced 0 findings | Likely corrupt run; excluded from averages automatically |
