This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

R3D-cs is a .NET/C# binding library for [r3d](https://github.com/Bigfoot71/r3d), an advanced 3D rendering library built on top of raylib. The project consists of:

1. **R3D-cs** - The main bindings library (auto-generated + manual utilities)
2. **R3D-cs.GenerateBindings** - Tool to generate C# bindings from r3d C headers
3. **Examples** - Sample applications demonstrating r3d features

## Critical Architecture Concepts

### Bindings Generation Architecture

The bindings are **partially auto-generated** from the r3d C headers:

- **Auto-generated files** (`.g.cs` suffix):
  - `enums/**/*.g.cs` - C enums mapped to C# enums
  - `types/**/*.g.cs` - C structs mapped to C# structs
  - `interop/**/*.g.cs` - P/Invoke declarations for C functions
  - These files have "Do not edit manually" headers

- **Hand-written files** (no `.g.cs` suffix):
  - `R3D-cs/interop/R3D.Utilities.cs` - Helper methods, constants, and convenience wrappers
  - Contains `MATERIAL_BASE`, `DECAL_BASE`, `PROCEDURAL_SKY_BASE` constants
  - Contains `MapInstances<T>()`, `SetEnvironmentEx()`, `CreateMeshData()` utility methods

**IMPORTANT**: When r3d structs change (like `Material` or `InstanceBuffer`), you MUST update:
1. Auto-generated files via bindings generator
2. `R3D.Utilities.cs` constants manually (they won't auto-update)
3. Native DLLs in `runtimes/win-x64/native/`

### Struct Marshaling with DisableRuntimeMarshalling

The project uses `[assembly: DisableRuntimeMarshalling]` in `R3D.core.g.cs` for performance. This means:

- Structs must have `[StructLayout(LayoutKind.Sequential)]`
- Fixed buffers work correctly with `LibraryImport` (preferred over `DllImport`)
- Structs with complex layouts may need special handling

**Known Issue**: Functions returning structs by value with fixed buffers may fail if the native DLL is out of sync with C# struct definitions. Symptoms: fields appear to have wrong values (e.g., `Capacity` reads from wrong offset).

### Native Library Synchronization

The C# bindings and native DLLs (`r3d.dll`, `raylib.dll`, `assimp-vc145-mt.dll`) MUST match:

```
C# Binding (*.g.cs) <---> C Header (*.h) <---> Compiled DLL (*.dll)
     ^                        ^                      ^
     |                        |                      |
  Generated from          Source of truth        Built from
```

**Production**: CI automatically builds matching DLLs for all platforms during release.
**Development**: You may need to build DLLs locally to test binding changes before CI runs.

If they don't match, you'll see:
- Crashes with access violations (`0xC0000005`)
- Struct fields containing garbage data
- Wrong function signatures causing stack corruption

## Building and Development

### Build the main library
```bash
dotnet build R3D-cs.sln
```

### Run examples
```bash
# Run specific example
cd Examples
dotnet run -- <example-name>  # e.g., shader, lights, transparency

# Run all examples sequentially
dotnet run
```

### Update r3d upstream

The r3d source is pinned as a git submodule at `External/r3d`. To update:

```bash
cd External/r3d
git fetch origin
git checkout <new-tag-or-commit>   # e.g. git checkout v0.9
cd ../..
git add External/r3d
```

After updating you should regenerate bindings and rebuild native libraries (see below).

### Regenerate bindings from r3d source

**When to regenerate**:
- r3d library updates its C API
- New functions/structs/enums are added
- Existing struct layouts change

**Steps**:
```bash
cd R3D-cs.GenerateBindings

# Uses External/r3d submodule by default (no -p needed)
dotnet run

# Or specify a different r3d repository path
dotnet run -- -p /path/to/r3d

# Override version detection
dotnet run -- -v 0.8.0
```

**After regeneration**, you MUST:
1. Update `R3D.Utilities.cs` if `Material`, `Decal`, or other constants changed
2. Rebuild r3d native library for local development/testing (see below)

### Rebuild r3d native library (Development Only)

**Important**: Building native libraries is only needed for local development and testing.

- **DO NOT commit** DLLs in `runtimes/` folder to git
- **CI builds them automatically** for all platforms during release
- Only build locally when you need to test bindings changes immediately

```bash
# Build from the submodule
cd External/r3d
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON \
      -DR3D_ASSIMP_VENDORED=ON -DR3D_RAYLIB_VENDORED=ON ..
cmake --build . --config Release -j8

# Copy DLLs to R3D-cs for local testing (DO NOT COMMIT)
cp bin/Release/*.dll ../../../R3D-cs/runtimes/win-x64/native/
```

**Note**: Native DLLs in `runtimes/*/native/` are already in `.gitignore` and will not be committed. CI automatically builds and packages them for all platforms during the release process.

## Code Generation Internals

### TypeMapper.cs - Type Translation Rules

Maps C types to C# equivalents:

- Primitives: `int` → `int`, `float` → `float`, `bool` → `bool`
- Pointers: `Type*` → `Type*` (unsafe), `const char*` → `string`
- **Pointer-to-pointer**: `Type**` → `Type**` (NOT `ref Type`)
- **`const char**`** / `const char*[]` → `byte**`
- **Function pointers** (`void (*)()`) → `IntPtr`
- Arrays: `Type[N]` → `fixed Type Field[N]`
- **`char[N]`** → `internal fixed byte _field[N]` + `string` property (auto UTF-8)
- Opaque types: Empty structs or unions with no fields (e.g., `ScreenShader`, `AnimationTreeNode`)

**GetParameterModifier()** logic:
- `Get*` functions with primitive pointers → `out` parameters
- Single pointers to structs → `ref` parameters
- Pointer-to-pointer (`**`) → kept as-is (raw pointer)
- Opaque handles → kept as pointers

### CommentGenerator.cs

Extracts Doxygen-style comments from C headers and converts to C# XML doc comments:
- `@brief` → `<summary>`
- `@param` → `<param>`
- `@return` → `<returns>`
- `@warning` → `<remarks><b>Warning:</b>`

### CodeGenerator.cs

Generates four file types:
1. **Enums** (`enums/`) - Strips `R3D_` prefix, converts to PascalCase, strips `Mode`/`Type`/`Status` suffixes from values
2. **Structs** (`types/`) - Adds `unsafe` if contains pointers/fixed buffers
   - Typed pointer + count/capacity pairs → internal pointer + public `Span<T>` property (prefers `Capacity` over `Count`)
   - `char[N]` fixed buffers → internal backing field + public `string` property with UTF-8 get/set
   - Callback fields (ending in `Callback`) → `IntPtr`
3. **Misc** (`types/`) - Callback delegates (`[UnmanagedFunctionPointer]`), opaque handle types, macro-based enums
4. **P/Invoke** (`interop/`) - Groups by C header file, uses `LibraryImport`

## Common Pitfalls

### When MATERIAL_BASE causes rendering issues
**Symptom**: Objects don't render or render incorrectly after r3d update
**Cause**: `Material` struct changed but `MATERIAL_BASE` in `R3D.Utilities.cs` wasn't updated
**Fix**: Compare `Material.g.cs` with `MATERIAL_BASE` and add missing fields with defaults

### When pointer-to-pointer functions crash
**Symptom**: Crash when calling functions like `SetScreenShaderChain`
**Cause**: Bindings generator converted `Type**` to `ref Type`
**Fix**: Should be auto-fixed by TypeMapper.cs check for `EndsWith("**")`, but verify binding

### When InstanceBuffer.Capacity is wrong
**Symptom**: Capacity shows 1 or garbage value instead of expected count
**Cause**: Native DLL built with different `R3D_INSTANCE_ATTRIBUTE_COUNT` than C# bindings
**Fix**: Rebuild r3d library and update DLLs

### When MapInstances crashes with IndexOutOfRangeException
**Symptom**: Accessing positions array throws index out of bounds
**Cause**: Span constructor was given byte count instead of element count
**Fix**: `new Span<T>(ptr, buffer.Capacity)` NOT `buffer.Capacity * sizeof(T)`

## Updating to a New r3d Version

End-to-end checklist for updating bindings when a new r3d version is released:

### 1. Update submodule
```bash
cd External/r3d
git fetch origin --tags
git checkout <new-tag>   # e.g. git checkout v0.9
cd ../..
```

### 2. Review header changes
Compare headers between versions to understand API changes:
```bash
cd External/r3d
git diff <old-tag>..<new-tag> --stat -- 'include/*.h'
```
Look for: new headers, removed headers, renamed types/functions, changed struct layouts.

### 3. Fix generator if needed
Common issues when new C patterns appear:
- **New opaque types**: unions or empty structs auto-detected, but verify
- **New callback typedefs**: auto-generated as delegates; parameter names that are C# keywords need `EscapeIdentifier`
- **New type patterns**: e.g., `char**`, function pointer params — check TypeMapper handles them

### 4. Regenerate bindings
```bash
cd R3D-cs.GenerateBindings
dotnet run -- -v <version>   # e.g. -v 0.9.0
```

### 5. Update hand-written code
- **`R3D.Utilities.cs`**: Update constants (`MATERIAL_BASE`, `PROCEDURAL_SKY_BASE`, `DECAL_BASE`) if struct layouts changed. Add convenience overloads for new shader types (e.g., `SetSkyShaderUniform<T>`).
- **Examples**: Update for any renamed APIs. Port new upstream examples from `External/r3d/examples/`. Copy any new resources (models, shaders) from upstream.

### 6. Build and verify
```bash
dotnet build R3D-cs.sln
```
Fix any compilation errors from API renames in examples or utilities.

### 7. Commit, tag, and push
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Update bindings to r3d <version>"
git tag v<version>
git push origin master --tags
```

### 8. Create GitHub release
After CI passes (builds native DLLs and publishes NuGet package):
```bash
gh release create v<version> --title "v<version>" --notes "<release notes>"
```
Follow the format of previous releases (see `gh release view v0.8.2` for reference). Include: what changed, breaking changes, install instructions, commit list, and full changelog link.

### 9. Notify upstream
Update the binding version in the [r3d README bindings table](https://github.com/Bigfoot71/r3d#bindings):
1. Update `README.md` in your fork (`graphnode/r3d`) with the new version number
2. Open a PR to `Bigfoot71/r3d` (see [PR #193](https://github.com/Bigfoot71/r3d/pull/193) as reference)

## Dependencies

- **Raylib-cs** (7.0.2): C# bindings for raylib, required dependency
- **CppAst** (0.24.0): C/C++ parser for header files (bindings generator only)
- **r3d native libraries**: Included in `runtimes/`, built from r3d source (pinned via `External/r3d` submodule)
