# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working in this repository.

## This repo

**Claude Code Development Framework** — a reusable `.claude/` directory with 23 skills, context files, hooks, and documentation that structures Claude Code into a disciplined spec → implement → review → fix → test pipeline with built-in learning.

The `src/` directory contains the **AI Maturity Score** demo app — a working example of the framework applied to a real Next.js/TypeScript project.

To use the framework in a new project: copy the `.claude/` directory into your repo and update `CLAUDE.md` for your tech stack.

Full framework docs: `.claude/docs/README.md`

## Demo app tech stack

| Layer     | Technology                           |
| --------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Framework | Next.js 14 (App Router) + TypeScript |
| Styling   | Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui             |
| State     | Zustand                              |
| Charts    | Recharts                             |
| Testing   | Vitest + React Testing Library       |
| Deploy    | Vercel                               |

## Demo app commands

```bash
npm run dev        # Start dev server
npm run build      # Production build (also catches TS errors in JSX)
npm run lint       # ESLint
npx tsc --noEmit   # Typecheck only
npx vitest run     # Run all tests
```

## Demo app architecture

```
src/
  lib/scoring/      # Pure TS scoring engine — no React dependencies
  components/       # assessment/ + results/ UI
  app/              # Next.js App Router pages
  store/            # Zustand state
```

IMPORTANT: `src/lib/scoring/` must remain framework-agnostic pure functions — do not add React dependencies.

## Framework skills

### Core pipeline

| Skill                 | Purpose                                                                                                             |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/decompose`          | Break a concept doc or product brief into independent PRDs, then ship each through the pipeline                     |
| `/fleet`              | Ship decomposed PRDs in parallel — conflict analysis, batched worktrees, concurrent `/ship` runs, merge to main    |
| `/ship <feature>`     | Full pipeline orchestrator — spec → implement → review → fix → commit. `--dry-run` runs spec only and reports scope |
| `/0_spec <feature>`   | Write a structured spec from requirements in `.claude/input/`                                                       |
| `/1_implement <spec>` | Implement with mandatory plan approval, TDD enforcement, and impact analysis                                        |
| `/2_review [spec]`    | 9-lens code review with severity classification and spec completeness check                                         |
| `/3_fix [review]`     | Fix issues by severity (critical → major → minor) with circuit breaker                                              |
| `/test [file]`        | Run typecheck → lint → tests → build (report only, no fixes)                                                        |

### Development tools

| Skill                 | Purpose                                                                            |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/commit`             | Atomic conventional commits with multi-concern detection                           |
| `/debug`              | Diagnose and fix a failing test, type error, or runtime error                      |
| `/impact <function>`  | Blast radius analysis — find all call sites, test mocks, and consumers (read-only) |
| `/smoke [spec]`       | Write and run smoke tests against a Docker stack from a spec                       |
| `/audit`              | Find and fix vulnerable dependencies across package managers                       |
| `/healthcheck`        | Scan Docker container logs for errors, crashes, and warnings                       |
| `/create-hook`        | Scaffold a Claude Code lifecycle hook                                              |
| `/harvest <repo-url>` | Clone and analyze a repo's Claude Code setup; generate adoption proposals          |
| `/deploy <path>`      | Deploy framework to a project via symlinks (junctions on Windows)                  |

### Knowledge & session management
