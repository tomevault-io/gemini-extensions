## START HERE — Onboarding

All authoritative engineering reasoning memory lives in:

ob_vault/

This vault is the architecture intent layer for the system.

Treat:

repo = implementation truth
ob_vault = reasoning truth

Agents must consult the vault before modifying lifecycle behavior, architecture, orchestration logic, or execution semantics.

Start with:

ob_vault/00 - Home.md
ob_vault/Handoff/Agent Handoff.md
ob_vault/Project/State.md
ob_vault/Architecture/core/
ob_vault/Phases/Phase N - *.md

---

## Project

**thekedar** is a Go-based agent orchestrator (AGPL-3.0) that manages AI coding agents (Claude Code, Codex) through a central manager. The manager analyzes tasks using an LLM, spawns agents (dev/qa/review), and coordinates them via native agent-teams and terminal polling. v1 runs locally via tmux. Single project per instance.

**Core Value:** Autonomous dev loop coordination — from task intake through agent spawning, feedback routing, and PR merge — without human intervention beyond initial task assignment.

## Build & Test

```bash
go build ./...                                 # Build all packages
go test ./...                                  # Run all tests
go test -race -count=1 ./...                   # Full suite with race detection
go test ./internal/storage -run TestName -v    # Single test
go vet ./...                                   # Static analysis
golangci-lint run ./...                        # Lint (v2 config in .golangci.yml)
```

---

## Constraints

- **Language:** Go, idiomatic, standard layout (`cmd/`, `internal/`)
- **License:** AGPL-3.0
- **v1 runtime:** tmux only (no K8s/Docker)
- **v1 agents:** Claude Code + Codex CLI only
- **v1 scope:** Single project per instance
- **Testing:** TDD mandatory — write failing test first, then implement. Table-driven tests with testify.
- **API contract:** JSON envelope `{"data": ...}` or `{"error": {"code": N, "message": "..."}}` (see `internal/api/response.go`)
- **Handlers must be thin.** Business logic lives in domain packages (runtime, state, storage), not in HTTP handlers.

## Known Residual Issues

1. **Spawn route mismatch:** `POST /api/v1/agents/{id}/spawn` ignores the URL `{id}`. Fix: change route to `POST /api/v1/agents/spawn`.
2. **Poller doesn't emit `terminal_update`:** WebSocket transport works but Poller doesn't publish `terminal_update` events to EventBus. Fix: add `EventBus.Publish` in Poller when content changes.

---

## Working Conventions

- Use idiomatic Go — explicit, no magic
- Keep handlers thin — business logic in domain packages
- Preserve the shared response envelope (`internal/api/response.go`)
- TDD: failing test first, then implement
- Do not silently change API contracts without updating tests
- Do not revert unrelated work
- Keep branch state green after each commit
- Update `ob_vault/Project/State.md` when phases complete
- Update the Obsidian vault continuously as work progresses. Conversations, decisions, context, research, findings, implementation notes, caveats, gaps, and phase status changes should be captured in `ob_vault/` so future Codex/Claude sessions can recover project state without re-discovery.
- Prefer updating the most relevant existing vault note first; create a new vault note only when the information does not fit an established document cleanly.

---

## Agent Operating Modes

Agents operate in one of three modes:

Planner Mode
Executor Mode
Reviewer Mode

Agents must determine their operating mode based on task intent before selecting vault context.

---

## Planner Mode

Planner Mode applies when:

creating plans
extending roadmap
designing architecture
coordinating agents
changing lifecycle logic
introducing orchestration behavior

Planner Mode MUST read:

Runtime Model/
Architecture/Core/
Decisions/
Planning/
Phases/

Planner Mode MUST align plans with:

Task lifecycle
Execution lifecycle
Agent lifecycle
Transition model
Event semantics

Planner Mode MUST NOT violate accepted ADR decisions.

### Planner Diagram Rule

Planner Mode requires diagram updates.

When introducing:

new lifecycle state
new transition
new execution phase
new orchestration path

agents MUST update:

Task Lifecycle FSM.excalidraw
Agent Lifecycle FSM.excalidraw
Manager Execution Loop.excalidraw

before implementation begins.

---

## Executor Mode

Executor Mode applies when:

writing code
implementing handlers
adding runtime logic
editing FSM transitions
changing agent execution behavior

Executor Mode MUST read:

Runtime Model/Task.md
Runtime Model/Event.md
Runtime Model/Execution.md
Runtime Model/Transitions.md

If modifying agent runtime:

Runtime Model/Agent.md
Runtime Model/Agent Contract.md

If modifying orchestration:

Architecture/Core/Manager.md
Architecture/Core/Planner.md

Executor Mode MUST NOT introduce undocumented lifecycle states.

Executor Mode MUST NOT introduce implicit transitions.

---

## Reviewer Mode

Reviewer Mode applies when:

reviewing PRs
validating architecture alignment
checking lifecycle correctness
evaluating orchestration safety

Reviewer Mode MUST read:

Runtime Model/
Architecture/Core/
Decisions/

Reviewer Mode MUST reject:

undocumented transitions
new lifecycle states
ADR conflicts
component boundary violations

---

## Deterministic Context Routing

Lifecycle changes:

Runtime Model/Task.md
Runtime Model/Event.md
Runtime Model/Execution.md
Runtime Model/Transitions.md

Agent runtime changes:

Runtime Model/Agent.md
Runtime Model/Agent Contract.md

Architecture changes:

Architecture/Core/System Map.md
Architecture/Core/*

Planner logic:

Runtime Model/Plan.md

---

## Metadata Aware Context Selection

Vault documents contain metadata:

type
object
used_by
stability
phase

Prefer:

stability: core

documents over:

stability: draft

---

## ADR Authority Rule

Before proposing architecture changes:

consult:

Decisions/

Accepted ADR decisions must not be overridden silently.

---

## Lifecycle Integrity Rule

Before modifying lifecycle behavior:

consult:

Runtime Model/Transitions.md
Runtime Model/Event.md
Runtime Model/Task.md
Runtime Model/Agent.md

Never introduce implicit transitions.

---

## Vocabulary Enforcement

Use terminology defined inside:

Runtime Model/
Architecture/Core/
Glossary/

Canonical entities:

Task
Execution
Agent
Plan
Transition
Event
Policy

Do not introduce synonyms.

---

## Architecture Drift Protection

Before modifying component structure:

consult:

Architecture/Core/System Map.md
Architecture/Core/*

Maintain component boundary integrity.

---

## Mismatch Detection Rule

If implementation conflicts with vault definitions:

report mismatch
describe difference
propose reconciliation

Do not silently resolve inconsistencies.

---

## Project

thekedar is a Go based agent orchestrator coordinating Claude Code and Codex agents via a manager driven lifecycle loop.

v1 runtime:

local
tmux only
single project per instance

---

## Build & Test

go build ./...
go test ./...
go test -race -count=1 ./...
go test ./internal/storage -run TestName -v
go vet ./...
golangci-lint run ./...

---

## Commits

Always sign commits:

git commit -s -S -m "message"

Never bypass signing.

Author:

Arush Salil [me@aru.sh](mailto:me@aru.sh)

---

## Vault Memory Rule

Continuously update:

ob_vault/

Capture:

decisions
research
implementation notes
phase completion
context changes

Prefer updating existing documents before creating new ones.

---

## Agent Orchestrator Session

Metadata updates automatically via:

~/.ao/bin/ao-metadata-helper.sh

---

## Diagram Maintenance Rule (Excalidraw)

Architecture diagrams inside:

ob_vault/Architecture/Diagrams/

are authoritative visual specifications.

When modifying:

lifecycle behavior
execution flow
event routing
planner pipeline
agent coordination

agents MUST update the corresponding Excalidraw diagram.

If diagram does not exist:

create it.

If diagram conflicts with implementation:

report mismatch.

---

## Template Usage Rule (Templater)

New vault documents MUST be created using templates located in:

ob_vault/templates/

Valid templates include:

runtime-object.md
ADR.md
task-spec.md

Agents must not create freeform documentation outside templates unless explicitly instructed.

---

## Metadata Indexing Rule (Dataview)

Vault navigation dashboards are generated using Dataview queries.

Agents MUST maintain YAML metadata headers in all vault documents.

Required metadata fields:

type
object
used_by
stability
phase

Agents must update metadata when document purpose changes.

---

## Template Selection Rule

Agents must select templates automatically:

runtime behavior change → runtime-object.md
architecture decision → ADR.md
execution task specification → task-spec.md

Template selection ensures vault consistency across sessions.

---

## Knowledge Index Automation Rule

Knowledge Index files are generated via Dataview queries.

Agents must update metadata rather than editing index files manually.

Indexes update automatically from metadata changes.

---

## Diagram Consistency Rule

Reviewer Mode must validate:

Excalidraw diagrams match lifecycle implementation.

If mismatch exists:

report discrepancy
do not approve implementation

Diagrams represent lifecycle intent.
