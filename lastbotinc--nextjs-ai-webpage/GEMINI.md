<documentation>
  The system is documented in the docs folder under following documents.
    @description.md:
        - Provide concise description of the app or system idea
        - Document core use cases and features
    @architecture.md:
        - Define full technical stack (frontend/backend frameworks, databases, testing frameworks)
        - Folder structure
    @datamodel.md:
        - Document all entities, attributes and relationships in a concise way
    @frontend.md:
        - List and describe all views/screens
        - Define UI/UX patterns and styling approach
    @backend.md:
        - Document all API endpoints and authentication
        - Define service architecture and components
    @todo.md
        - Tasks by logical areas and mark their status (✅ done, ⏳ in progress, ❌ not started). Next priority tasks in the end.
        - Prefer full stack tasks.
    @ai_changelog.md
        - Changelog of changes done
    @learnings.md
        - Consise technical learnings and best practices discovered during development
        - Solutions to occurred errors, including potential links

  Following files in the root folder explains the used libraries:
    @package.json:
      - list of used npm packages and their versions
</documentation>

<actions>
  <document>
     Scan, read and update documents under documentation tag according to instructions.
  </document>

  <research>
  Perform a comprehensive study and chain of thought reasoning of what to do. Steps:
    1. read_file @description, @architecture.md and /package.json for getting context
    2. execute codebase_search for finding relevant files and methods first for getting furher context.
    3. tavily-search the web for up-to-date documentation and getting started. Run at least one query always.
    4. After you have all the context, perform chain of thoughts using this format:
      4.1. "Reading required files..."
      4.2. "Analysis: what I found in the files..."
      4.3. "Plan: what needs to be done, what tools I need..."
      4.4. "Implementation: how I'll do it..."
      4.5. "Need more info: what more do I need to know..."
    5. Present the questions for the user to refine the plan
  </research>

  <fix>
  Perform a comprehensive study and chain of thought reasoning of what might cause the error and fix it.
    1. read_file learnings.md from the docs folder if you have an ready solutions for this
    2. Read all url's present in the error description
    3. Then search the web for the quick error resolutions.
    4. Perform chain of thoughts reasoning for the cause and potential fixes for the error
    5. Fix and validate the error
  </fix>

  <validate>
  Write comprehensive tests, run them and fix any errors
   1. read_file architecture.md for understanding of code structure and test practises
   2. write unit tests for the feature
   3. execute unit tests and fix each errors according to <fix> process
   4. write e2e tests for the feature
   5. execute e2e and fix each errors according to <fix> process
   6. On each fixed and validated bug, document the working error resolutions to learnings.md, including any links that you found usable.
   7. Repeat until all tests succeed
  </validate>

  <record>
   Record the changes done and update backlog
   1. write summary of what you did in the ai_changelog.md and update the todo list in the todo.md (do not remove any tasks, just update their status)
  </record>

  <design>
   Design a feature.
   1. read_file frontend.md for understanding the UI requirements and specifications like colors
   2. please design the frontend of the application or feature and document that to frontend.md
   3. generate any images or illustrations needed in the feature
   4. optimise the generated images
   5. write short instructions for the developer to communicate the design and images
  </design>

  <develop>
   Develop a feature.
    1. Develop the full e2e code changes for the requested feature
  </develop>

  <invent>
    1. please implement a tool in the tools/ directory and write a tool description in .cursorrules file.
    2. Execute the tool and fix any errors until it succesfully returns the results you wanted
  </invent>

  <commit>
    1. please commit all pending changes using git add . and git commit with descriptive message
  </commit>
</actions>

For each request, I will:

1. Analyze the request type and determine required actions from:
   - research: For understanding context and requirements
   - design: For UI/UX and visual elements
   - document: For updating the documentation
   - develop: For implementation
   - validate: For testing
   - fix: For error resolution
   - record: For recording changes and todo
   - invent: For creating new tools
   - commit: For version control

2. Present my analysis with:
   "Request type: [type]"
   "Required actions in order:"
   1. [action 1]
   2. [action 2]
   ...

3. For each action:
   - State "Starting [action]..."
   - Follow the action's specific steps
   - Show "Completed [action]"
   - Ask "Would you like me to proceed to [next action] or do you need any adjustments?"

4. Before proceeding to next action:
   - Wait for explicit confirmation
   - Document completed work in relevant files:
     - ai_changelog.md: What was done
     - todo.md: Update task status
     - learnings.md: For any solutions/fixes
     - Other relevant documentation

5. After final action:
   - Summarize all changes made
   - Ask if any final adjustments are needed

Please provide your request and I will analyze it according to this process.

Important rules for actions:
- Do not ever create a new project, scan the folders to understand the project structure.
- Do not rely on your current knowledge about libraries, always search the web for up-to-date information
- Always install the latest version of the libraries
