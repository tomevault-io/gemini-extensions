# CLAUDE.md — Noteback engineering notes

Project-local guidance for working in this repo. Read alongside `README.md`
(what/why), `CONTRACTS.md` (the runtime module API + behavioral invariants), and
`docs/design.md` (the original design).
This file records the **non-obvious gotchas** — things you can't infer by reading
the code, that have already bitten us once.

## Hard constraints (do not break)

- **Zero RUNTIME dependencies, no build step, no TypeScript.** The shipped code
  (`bin`, `src`, `skills`) loads unpacked exactly as written — never add a bundler,
  a framework, or a `dependencies` entry, and never `require` a package from
  `src/`. Tests run on the **Node built-in runner** (`npm test` → `node --test`).
  The **one** allowed exception is `devDependencies`: Playwright backs the browser
  e2e (`test/e2e/`, `npm run test:e2e`) that covers overlay DOM behaviour the Node
  suite can't. It is test-only and never reaches users (`files` ships `bin`/`src`/
  `skills` only). Needs the browser binary once: `npx playwright install chromium`.
- **One runtime, two modes.** The annotation engine in `src/runtime/` runs both
  as the extension content script (`ChromeStorageAdapter`) and inlined into a
  saved canvas file (`InFileStateAdapter`). Anything in `src/runtime/` must work
  in **both** — no `chrome.*` access, no extension-only globals. Mode-specific
  code lives in `src/content/`, `src/adapters/`, `src/canvas/`.
- **Pure-logic modules** (`anchor`, `state`, `markdown`) must run under Node *and*
  the browser (UMD-lite dual export) so they stay unit-testable. Keep them
  DOM-free.

## Gotchas that already bit us

- **CSS transition out of `display:none` does not reliably fire.** The comment
  chip's entrance is a **keyframe animation restarted by a forced reflow**:
  `el.classList.remove('nb-in'); void el.offsetWidth; el.classList.add('nb-in')`.
  Don't "simplify" it back to a `transition` — it'll snap in with no animation.
- **The comment chip is debounced (~340 ms).** A `setTimeout` is re-armed on each
  `selectionchange` and the anchor is re-resolved on `mouseup`. Two consequences:
  (1) live/Playwright tests must wait ~380 ms after selecting before the chip is
  clickable; (2) `commitPopover` is **async** (`await persist`) — a test that
  creates two comments synchronously will have the second reuse the first
  anchor (because `onSelectionChange` early-returns while a popover is open).
  Await the first commit.
- **Composer vs. sidebar outside-click are opposite on purpose.** The composer
  closes **only** via Cancel / Save / Escape (never outside-click); the sidebar
  **does** close on outside-click (guarded). See `CONTRACTS.md` §3.5. Don't
  "unify" them.
- **Markdown line refs are computed from the document markup**, not the DOM. The
  full (uncondensed) quote is located in `docHtml`; long quotes are condensed for
  *display* only. If a line ref and the quote ever disagree, **the quote wins** —
  it's the anchor; the line number is a convenience.
- **Line-number semantics differ by mode.** Embedded canvas → doc-content-relative
  (`#noteback-doc-root` innerHTML, line 1 = first body line). Extension →
  `documentElement.outerHTML` (file-absolute, tracks the opened file). Same
  `toMarkdown`, different `docHtml` origin. This is a deliberate, documented
  tradeoff — don't try to "fix" one to match the other.
- **Doc identity is the BAKED doc-id; a version is hashed from the CLEAN, pre-paint
  content root.** A draft's identity is the explicit `data-noteback-doc-id` baked on
  `#noteback-doc-root` (extension pages Noteback didn't author fall back to a per-URL
  minted id under `nb:url:<href>`). Within that doc-id, a *version* is keyed by a
  content hash over `#noteback-doc-root` `textContent` (`createHistoryStateAdapter`'s
  `contentText`), read before highlights are painted — never recompute it from the live
  DOM after `<mark>` wrappers are added, or the hash shifts (and the draft splinters
  into a new version). When the text is too short to hash, the version key falls back to
  `h0:<docId>`.
- **`window.localStorage` access can THROW (not just be absent) on `file://`** or
  when storage is blocked — and `file://` is the primary canvas use case. The
  `EMBEDDED_BOOT` builds the localStorage-backed kv store (`lsStore`) inside a
  `try/catch`; on failure `lsStore` is `null` and `createHistoryStateAdapter` degrades
  to the in-file `InFileStateAdapter` (comments still work, just no version history).
  Never reference `window.localStorage` raw in the boot guard, or a blocked store
  crashes the whole canvas mount (it did once — the overlay never appeared).
- **`file://` localStorage is one shared bucket** across all local canvases (Chrome).
  Keys are namespaced and keyed by the explicit doc-id (`nb:doc:<docId>`) /
  content-hashed version key (`nb:ver:<versionKey>`), with `nb:url:<href>` for
  per-URL minted ids (extension only), precisely so distinct documents don't collide in
  that shared bucket.
- **History snapshots the WHOLE clean document ONCE, at a version's first comment —
  there is no per-comment fragment/"section" extraction.** `snapshot-capture.js`
  `captureCleanDoc` clones `documentElement`, strips `[data-noteback-ui]`, **unwraps**
  every `<mark class="noteback-highlight">`, and drops `#noteback-state` + the inline
  runtime `<script>`, then stores the result gzipped (`makeCodec`). Because the marks
  are stripped, the snapshot is **paint-independent**: it does NOT matter whether
  highlights are painted when `save`/`persist` runs (the old "paint before persist"
  bug class and its `history-popup.e2e.test.js` guard are gone — `commitPopover`'s
  `repaintHighlights()` is now just a visual refresh with no ordering requirement vs.
  `persist`). `history-state-adapter.js` captures the snapshot only when the version
  has **no** snapshot yet (`needSnapshot = comments.length>0 && !r.hasSnapshot`);
  `hasSnapshot` is seeded from the real stored snapshot, never the comment count.
- **Version viewing is IN-TAB and read-only.** Clicking a version row opens
  `overlay.openVersionInline` — a read-only `<iframe srcdoc>` side panel
  (`.nb-hist-view`) beside the sidebar (NOT a new tab, NOT a centered modal). It
  reuses the snapshot painter (`paintHighlights` + re-injected `HIGHLIGHT_CSS` +
  `buildPeekPopoverScript`). An in-tab `viewingKey` drives the timeline: the viewed
  row is the active `nb-ver-viewing` row (active dot + highlight — there is **no**
  "you are here" text label), a "Back to current" bar (`renderBackToCurrentBar` →
  `closeVersionInline`) returns to the live draft, and other rows switch. There is
  NO new-tab "checkout" (`openVersionTab` / the `data-noteback-checkout` marker were
  removed) because a `window.open(blob:)` tab from a `file://` canvas gets an opaque
  origin whose `localStorage` is denied, leaving the opened tab's history sidebar
  empty (the bug). The `.nb-hist-frame` iframe fills the panel as a column-flex child
  (`flex:1;min-height:0`), not via absolute `height:calc(...)`.
- **The diff view diffs THIS version against the NEXT one, not the previous.**
  `overlay.openVersionDiff` resolves the target via `resolveTargetSnapshot`: the
  most-recent earlier version (index 0 of `getHistory`, newest-first) diffs against
  the LIVE current draft (`snapshotCapture.captureCleanDoc(document)`, labelled
  "now"); any older version diffs against the next-newer stored snapshot. The pure
  diff brain is `src/runtime/diff.js` (DOM-free, Node-tested); the DOM renderer is
  `src/runtime/diff-render.js` (browser-only, e2e-tested, like `highlight.js`).
  BOTH new files must be registered in the parity-locked runtime lists
  (`bin/noteback.js`, `examples/build-canvas.js`,
  `src/background/service-worker.js` — guarded by
  `test/canvas-runtime-parity.test.js`) AND in `manifest.json` (its `content_scripts`
  AND `web_accessible_resources` runtime-file arrays), ordered `diff.js` after
  `markdown.js` and `diff-render.js` after `highlight.js` (before `overlay.js`).
  Comment highlights are painted AFTER the diff wraps words, so a comment whose
  quote straddles a changed region may not re-anchor — unchanged-region highlights
  always do.
- **The diff's Prev/Next change navigator runs INSIDE the iframe, not from the
  overlay.** The legend (and its `‹ Prev · n/N · Next ›` cluster) lives in the diff
  `<iframe srcdoc>`, a separate document — so its buttons CANNOT be wired with
  overlay `addEventListener`; the click handling, `.nb-diff-focus` stepping (ring +
  intensified fill, wrapping both ends), scroll-to-centre, and counter are all an
  injected static `<script>` (`buildDiffNavScript`, same pattern as the peek
  script). It replaced the old one-shot "scroll to first change" script and keeps
  its no-changes fallback (scroll the first highlight into view). The separate
  **"Show diff"** shortcut on the live `now` timeline row IS overlay-side
  (`renderNowRow`): it sets `diffMode=true` and calls `openVersionInline(latestKey)`
  — shown only off the live draft and only when a latest earlier version exists.
- **The version chevron menu SAVES via download, not a tab.** A version row's `▾`
  menu has **Copy feedback** + **Save HTML with comments** + **Save clean HTML**
  (both saves disabled when the version's snapshot is pruned). "Save HTML with
  comments" rebuilds a re-openable canvas of that version with
  `buildVersionCanvasHtml` (re-added — clones the live shell, swaps in the snapshot
  content, re-seeds `#noteback-state` with the version's comments, escaping
  `</script>`; it does NOT bake a checkout marker); "Save clean HTML" saves the raw
  `v.html` snapshot. Both route through a new `exporter.onSaveHtml(html, name)` hook
  (embedded: `saveCanvasInPlace` → `downloadCanvas`). Because the result is
  **downloaded** (a fresh `file://` canvas when reopened, with its own storage), it
  sidesteps the opaque-origin `localStorage` problem that retired the new-tab open —
  this is why `buildVersionCanvasHtml` is back but `openVersionTab` is not.
- **The Versions timeline docks at the BOTTOM of the sidebar, not inside the comment
  list.** `renderVersions()` renders into `.nb-versions-dock` (a `flex:0 0 auto` band with
  `max-height:34vh`, its own scroll, collapsing via `:empty` when there are no earlier
  versions), a sibling between `.nb-list` (`flex:1`) and `.nb-foot`. So the current
  draft's notes (or the "No notes yet" empty state) keep the available room and the
  timeline stays put above the action buttons.
- **"Save · with comments and history" embeds the timeline in the FILE; the block is
  stripped everywhere else.** `onSaveCanvasWithHistory` → `adapter.exportHistory()` (core
  `exportDoc`) gathers `nb:doc:<id>` + every `nb:ver:<key>` (snapshots included) into a
  `<script id="noteback-history" type="application/json">` block (escaping `</script>` →
  `<\/script>`, valid JSON). On reopen the `EMBEDDED_BOOT` **synchronously** seeds
  `localStorage` from it BEFORE the adapter resolves, and **only for keys not already
  present** (never clobber newer local data — so two machines with diverged history don't
  merge their `nb:doc` version lists; a fresh machine rehydrates fully). The block must be
  excluded from snapshots (`captureCleanDoc`), clean copies (`rebuildCleanHtml`), and plain
  "with comments" saves (`rebuildHtml` via `buildCanvasClone`) — else it nests/recurses.
  Do NOT mark it `data-noteback-ui`
  to get free stripping: the cross-world stand-down keys off `[data-noteback-ui]`, so a
  CSP-blocked canvas carrying the block would make the extension stand down and mount
  nothing. Covered by `test/e2e/history-embed.e2e.test.js`.
- **A `hidden` menu item needs `.nb-menu-item[hidden]{display:none}` — the `hidden`
  attribute alone does NOTHING here.** `.nb-menu-item{display:block}` is an author rule of
  equal specificity to the UA `[hidden]{display:none}`, and author wins — so an item with
  the `hidden` attribute still renders (it bit the "with comments and history" visibility
  toggle: the property was set, the item stayed visible). The explicit
  `.nb-menu-item[hidden]{display:none}` (specificity class+attr) restores it.
- **`wrap` PRESERVES an existing doc-id — don't make it re-mint.** The version history
  follows the baked `data-noteback-doc-id`, so re-wrapping a canvas must keep the same
  id or the history orphans. `bin/noteback.js`'s precedence is: explicit `--id` → the id
  already baked in the `-o` target file → the id baked in the input HTML
  (`#noteback-doc-root[data-noteback-doc-id]` OR a source `<!-- noteback-doc-id: … -->`
  marker, via `readBakedDocId`/`readMarkerDocId`) → mint a fresh one (`mintDocId`). The
  `-o`-target reuse is the easy one to drop — it's how `wrap` in place keeps history
  across re-exports.
- **`--bake-id` anchors the id in the SOURCE so a deleted `-o` canvas can't orphan
  history.** With a SEPARATE `-o` target (e.g. `examples/spec.html -o examples/spec.canvas.html`),
  the resolved id lives ONLY in the gitignored canvas; `rm` it and the next `wrap`
  re-mints, splintering history. `--bake-id` stamps `bakeDocIdIntoSource` into the
  tracked source as a `<!-- noteback-doc-id: … -->` comment (after the doctype, so it
  can't trigger quirks mode; prepended for fragments; idempotent — re-bake replaces,
  never duplicates). The marker is SOURCE-ONLY: `wrapFile` runs `stripDocIdMarker` on
  the doc content before building, so it never leaks into the canvas (which carries the
  authoritative id on `#noteback-doc-root`). In-place wrap ignores `--bake-id` (the
  canvas already carries the id and would clobber the marker). `examples/spec.html` is
  anchored this way (`dmq41se03tm5q0nu8bh`).
- **Extension history is GATED per-site (`historyAllowed`), decided at first mount.**
  `origin-policy.js` `historyAllowed(info, settings)` is default-on for
  `file`/`localhost`/`127.0.0.1` and opt-in via `historySites` for any other origin.
  When it's false the content script keeps the comments-only `ChromeStorageAdapter`
  (no version timeline). The gate is read once at first `mount()`, so toggling a
  per-site history opt-in takes effect on **reload**, not live (unlike the
  activate/deactivate transition, which is live on `chrome.storage.onChanged`). The
  embedded canvas has no settings and always runs history (subject to `lsStore`).
  `createChromeKvStore` THROWS if `chrome.storage.local` is missing — the content
  script catches it (not `.catch()`) and degrades.
- **The click-to-activate injection list is sourced from the manifest, never
  copied.** `popup.js` activates unsupported-origin pages by reading
  `chrome.runtime.getManifest().content_scripts[0].js` and `executeScript`-ing
  that exact list. Don't hard-code the file list in the popup — it would silently
  drift the next time a runtime file is added to the manifest, and the injected
  page would boot an incomplete runtime.
- **The extension and an embedded canvas run in SEPARATE JS worlds — the
  single-mount guard can't cross.** Open a saved canvas while the extension is
  installed and BOTH want to annotate the page: the canvas's inlined runtime boots
  in the page's MAIN world, the content script in an ISOLATED world. `boot.js`'s
  `window.__notebackBooted` is a **per-world** global, so the content script never
  sees the canvas's flag — without help both mount (two launchers) and the
  extension routes comments to **chrome.storage** while the canvas's localStorage
  history stays empty (comments appear, but no version is ever recorded — the
  symptom that bit us). The hand-off rides the DOM, the only shared channel:
  `boot.js` stamps a **synchronous** `<div data-noteback-ui="mount">` (before its
  first `await`, so it's in place by the extension's `document_idle`), and
  `content-script.js` stands down via `originPolicy.overlayMounted(document)`. The
  marker rides `[data-noteback-ui]`, so every export strip drops it and `destroy()`
  removes it. **Don't "simplify" the guard back to the JS flag alone** — it silently
  does nothing across worlds. Covered by `test/e2e/extension-standdown.e2e.test.js`,
  which loads the real unpacked extension (`channel: 'chromium'`) and reproduces
  the double-mount.
- **`extractBodyMarkup` drops the WHOLE `<head>` — so the canvas re-carries the doc's
  styling separately.** A styled source (inline `<style>` in `<head>`) wrapped naively
  rendered as raw unstyled HTML in the canvas (the body markup survived, the `<head>`
  `<style>` didn't). `exporter.extractHeadStyles` pulls the original head's inline
  `<style>` blocks **and** `<link rel="stylesheet">` refs (EXCLUDING any
  `[data-noteback-ui]` style — the runtime re-injects its own), and `buildCanvasHtml`
  substitutes them into the template's `{{DOC_STYLE}}` head token. Two constraints:
  (1) the `<title>` is deliberately NOT carried — the template owns the canvas title
  (`<title>… — Noteback feedback canvas</title>`), and a test asserts the original
  `<title>` never lands in the output; (2) `{{DOC_STYLE}}` is replaced **last** of all
  tokens, so a CSS rule like `content:"{{x}}"` in the carried stylesheet isn't eaten by
  an earlier token pass. Covered by the head-carry tests in `test/exporter.test.js`.
- **History opt-out is a SUBTRACT layer, and the two surfaces go live differently.**
  `origin-policy.historyAllowed` subtracts `historyDisabledGlobal` /
  `historyDisabledSites` / `historyDisabledDocs` (keyed on the resolved history
  doc-id, passed as `info.docKey`) above the base rule. The **extension** can't gate
  in place (it picks adapter TYPE at mount), so a live opt-out **re-mounts**
  (`content-script.js` `applySettings` compares `lastHistoryOk` and unmount+mounts on
  a flip; the gate is computed once via `historyOkFor`) — the "gate read once at
  mount" invariant still holds (a re-mount is a new mount). The **embedded** canvas
  always builds the history adapter, so it gates **in place** via
  `createHistoryStateAdapter`'s `isEnabled()` (fed by `historyControl` over
  `nb:nohist:global` / `nb:nohist:doc:<docId>`, read/written with **guarded** raw
  localStorage). Opt-out HIDES the timeline and stops recording but KEEPS stored
  snapshots; re-enabling the gear re-saves the live draft (`persist(getState())`) so
  the now-enabled version adopts comments added while off.

## Live verification (Playwright)

- Serve over **localhost**, not `file://` (the latter is blocked).
- **After editing any `src/runtime/` file, rebuild the canvas AND cache-bust the
  URL** before re-testing:
  `node bin/noteback.js wrap examples/spec.html -o examples/spec.canvas.html`,
  then load it with a bumped `?v=N`. The browser HTTP-caches the **inlined**
  runtime, so a stale canvas silently runs old code. (Symptom we hit:
  `lineRangeOf.toString()` showed the old body with no fallback.) `examples/
  spec.canvas.html` is gitignored and rebuilt each time.

## Distribution model (two independent registries)

- `npx skills add alekkowalczyk/noteback` → **GitHub** is the registry
  ([vercel-labs/skills](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills)). It clones the
  public repo and reads `skills/noteback/SKILL.md` from the default
  branch. Needs: public repo, `name`+`description` frontmatter, on default branch.
- `npx noteback wrap` / `npx noteback install-skill` → **npm** is the registry
  (the published `noteback` package's `bin`).
- **`install-skill` mirrors `skills add`'s layout** (`bin/noteback.js`
  `planInstall`): real files in the vendor-neutral `~/.agents/skills/` hub —
  read **natively by Codex and OpenCode** — plus a relative symlink in
  `~/.claude/skills/` (Claude Code reads only there). One install covers all
  three; it does **not** use `~/.codex/skills/` (the current Codex docs read
  `.agents/skills`, not `.codex/skills`). `--dir <path>` is a plain-copy escape
  hatch (no hub/symlink). Idempotent: a stale dir/symlink at a target is replaced.
- GitHub serves the *skill*; npm serves the *`wrap` CLI*. They're decoupled.
  `npm publish` requires 2FA (`npm publish --otp=<code>` or a granular token with
  "bypass 2fa"). Publishing and pushing are the **maintainer's** actions — don't
  run them unprompted.

## Repo conventions

- **Never commit to `main`** (the default branch). Work on a feature branch and
  open it for merge. (Mirrors the global rule; restated here because the branch
  was renamed from a feature branch to `main`.)
- Commit trailer: `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.8 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>`.
- Screenshots used in docs live in `examples/screenshots/`.
