## What this project is

One sentence: *Stop loading your team's knowledge into every prompt. Compile only what
the task needs.*

Teams working on many projects in one domain keep shared knowledge (conventions, ADRs,
specs, decisions) as Markdown in a **knowledge git repo**. This service indexes it and
serves task-relevant, token-budgeted context bundles to AI coding agents (Claude Code,
Cursor, Codex) over **MCP** and REST.

## Locked architecture decisions — do NOT revisit without an ADR

These were decided after research. Do not "improve" them mid-task. If you believe one is
wrong, stop and propose an ADR instead of changing code.

1. **Language: Go** (>= 1.26). Single static binary. Official MCP Go SDK
   (`modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk`, v1.x).
2. **Storage: SQLite only** (WAL mode). One `.db` file holds documents, chunks,
   embeddings, usage events, bundle cache, sync state.
3. **Search: hybrid** — SQLite **FTS5 (BM25)** + **brute-force cosine over vectors stored
   in SQLite** (in-memory scan in Go, see ADR-0002) fused with **RRF, k=60**. No ANN
   libraries, no vector extensions. BM25-only mode must remain available via config
   (`embeddings.enabled=false`).
4. **Embeddings: local by default** — `multilingual-e5-small` (384-dim, 100+ languages;
   ADR-0006) or `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (English, faster) run by our pure-Go encoder
   (ADR-0003; weights downloaded once, no ONNX runtime, no CGO), pluggable adapters:
   `ollama`, `openai-compatible`, `none`. Adapter interface first, implementations
   behind it.
5. **Git is the source of truth. The index is a disposable cache.** The service must be
   able to rebuild the entire index from a fresh clone. Never store knowledge that exists
   only in SQLite.
6. **Agents never write to the index directly.** `propose_update` creates a git
   branch/commit (PR-based review). Merge → sync → reindex is the only write path.
7. **Deployment: one container, zero external services.** Never add Redis, Postgres,
   Elasticsearch, Qdrant, or any message queue. Caching is in-process LRU + SQLite tables.
8. **Token budget is a hard constraint.** Any API that returns context accepts
   `max_tokens` and must never exceed it. Truncation strategy lives in the bundle
   packer, nowhere else.
9. **License: Apache-2.0.** No AGPL/GPL/SSPL dependencies. Check licenses before adding
   any dependency.

```

## Workflow rules

- **Read `SPEC.md` before implementing any feature.** If the spec is silent or
  ambiguous, ask; do not invent behavior.
- Work in **small vertical slices** that end in something runnable (see PROMPTS.md
  milestones). Do not scaffold all packages upfront.
- Every non-obvious technical decision gets an ADR in `docs/adr/` in the same PR.
- Conventional commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `refactor:`).
- Update `SPEC.md` when implemented behavior legitimately diverges from it — spec and
  code must not drift.

## Coding conventions

- Standard Go style; `gofmt` + `golangci-lint` clean.
- Errors: wrap with context (`fmt.Errorf("indexing %s: %w", path, err)`); no panics
  outside `main`.
- No premature abstraction: interfaces only where a second implementation exists or is
  specced (Embedder is the canonical example).
- The whole binary is pure Go: SQLite via `ncruces/go-sqlite3` (ADR-0002), embeddings via
  `internal/embed/minilm` (ADR-0003). Do not introduce CGO without an ADR.
- All SQL lives in `internal/store`. No SQL strings elsewhere.
- Config precedence: flags > env (`BRIEFD_*`) > yaml > defaults.

## Testing rules

Two mandatory layers — a feature is not done without both where applicable:

1. **Deterministic tests** (`go test ./...`):
   - Chunking: heading hierarchy preserved, size limits respected, stable chunk IDs.
   - Git sync: changed/deleted files trigger incremental reindex; full rebuild from
     clean clone produces identical index.
   - RRF: pure-function table-driven tests.
   - Budget packer: output never exceeds `max_tokens` (property-style test with random
     inputs).
2. **Retrieval quality eval** (`briefd eval`):
   - Golden dataset in `eval/` (corpus + queries + expected chunk IDs).
   - Metrics: **Recall@5, Recall@10, MRR**.
   - CI gate: fail if Recall@5 drops below the threshold in `eval/thresholds.yaml`.
   - Any change to chunking, embeddings, or fusion MUST run the eval and report
     before/after numbers in the PR description.

## Off limits

- Do not add external service dependencies (see locked decision #7).
- Do not modify `eval/golden/*` to make a failing eval pass.
- Do not bypass the git write path with direct index mutations.
- Do not add telemetry/phone-home of any kind.
