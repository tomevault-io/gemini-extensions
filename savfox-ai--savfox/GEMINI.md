# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to Codex and other coding agents working in this repository.

## Scope

- This is the root guide for the whole workspace.
- Directory-specific `AGENTS.md` files take precedence for their subtree.
- Today the main local override is `crates/tui/src/bottom_pane/AGENTS.md`, which adds doc-sync requirements for bottom-pane state machines.

## Source Of Truth

- Prefer `Cargo.toml`, `Justfile`, crate `README.md` files, and current source code over older prose docs when they disagree.
- Some docs still reference older names such as `codex-api` or `OpenClaw`; do not copy those names into new code or new documentation unless you are intentionally documenting compatibility behavior.

## Build And Test Commands

### Workspace-wide

```bash
cargo build --workspace
cargo test --workspace
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo fmt --all
cargo fmt --all -- --check
```

### Common targeted test commands

```bash
cargo test -p savfox-core
cargo test -p savfox-tui
cargo test -p savfox-exec
cargo test -p savfox-app-server
cargo test -p savfox-app-server-protocol
cargo test -p savfox-gateway-server
cargo test -p savfox-api-client
cargo test -p savfox-mcp-server
```

### CLI install

```bash
cargo install --path crates/savfox-cli
```

### `just` shortcuts

```bash
just check
just lint
just test
just fmt
just gateway
just gateway-release
just gateway-skip-web
just gateway-backend
just gateway-frontend
just web-build
just web-build-release
just web-serve
```

Notes:

- `just gateway` and `just gateway-release` run `scripts/build-web.ps1` before starting the gateway.
- `just gateway-backend` runs only the gateway server on the fixed dev port `18881` and is meant to pair with `just gateway-frontend`.
- `just gateway-frontend` runs `dx serve --web` for the Dioxus app; its dev server proxies `/api`, `/health`, and `/ws` back to the local gateway backend on port `18881`.
- `just gateway-skip-web` and `just web-serve` remain available as compatibility aliases for the split backend/frontend dev loop.

## Workspace Architecture

Savfox is a large Rust workspace centered on `savfox-core`, with multiple product surfaces layered on top of it.

```

### Main crates

- `crates/savfox-cli`: the `savfox` binary. It dispatches to the interactive TUI when no subcommand is given and exposes commands like `exec`, `review`, `login`, `gateway`, `app-server`, `mcp`, `sessions`, `skills`, `daemon`, `cron`, `doctor`, and `sandbox`.
- `crates/exec`: powers `savfox exec` and `savfox review`. In normal mode stdout is reserved for final user-facing output; in `--json` mode stdout must remain valid JSONL.
- `crates/tui`: the interactive Ratatui/Crossterm UI. This crate has extensive snapshot coverage and its style guide lives in `crates/tui/styles.md`.
- `crates/core`: the main agent engine. It owns config loading, auth, session management, tool orchestration, sandboxing, MCP integration, skills, memory, review flow, rollouts, and shared session behavior used by all frontends.
- `crates/protocol`: shared protocol and event types used across `core`, `exec`, `tui`, and app/gateway surfaces. Keep business logic light here.
- `crates/api-client` and `crates/http-client`: typed wire/API layer for model providers and streaming responses. `core` consumes these rather than embedding HTTP protocol details directly.
- `crates/app-server` and `crates/app-server-protocol`: stdio JSON-RPC server and protocol types for IDE/editor integrations. Current exported protocol types are generated from `src/protocol/common.rs`, `src/protocol/session_history.rs`, and `src/protocol/v1.rs`.
- `crates/mcp-server` and `crates/rmcp-client`: Savfox as an MCP server plus support for external MCP servers/tools.
- `crates/gateway-server`: the remote HTTP/WebSocket gateway built on Salvo. It owns ws-rpc dispatch, auth, cron jobs, channel routing, webchat, browser/voice helpers, session bridging, and gateway-side state.
- `crates/gateway-dioxus` and `crates/gateway-shared`: the web frontend and its shared serde types. The built frontend is copied into `crates/gateway-server/static`.
- `crates/channels`: channel implementations for external platforms such as Discord, Telegram, Slack, Matrix, Mattermost, Feishu, IRC, Webhook, and others used by the gateway.
- `crates/memory`, `crates/skill-registry`, `crates/browser-automation`, `crates/network-proxy`, `crates/linux-sandbox`, and `crates/windows-sandbox`: supporting subsystems for long-term memory, skills, browser tooling, network policy, and platform sandboxing.
- `apps/` and `apps/shared/SavfoxKit`: Apple and Android client surfaces that talk to Savfox services rather than reimplementing the core agent stack.

## Project Conventions

- Rust edition is `2024`; workspace `rust-version` is `1.98`.
- Crate names are consistently prefixed with `savfox-`.
- Prefer workspace dependency declarations: add shared deps to `[workspace.dependencies]` and reference them with `{ workspace = true }`.
- Workspace lints matter here:
  - `unsafe_code = "deny"`
  - `unreachable_pub = "deny"`
  - many Clippy lints are enabled as warnings, and normal contributor workflow runs Clippy with `-D warnings`
- Many library crates deny direct stdout/stderr printing. Keep user-visible output in binaries, the TUI, or gateway/web layers; use tracing/logging elsewhere.
- Tests across the workspace commonly use `pretty_assertions::assert_eq`; prefer that style for new equality-heavy tests.
- Prefer targeted crate tests first, then broader workspace runs when touching shared behavior.

## TUI And UI Rules

- Follow `crates/tui/styles.md` for terminal color/styling choices.
- If you change TUI rendering or visible TUI text, expect to update snapshot files under `crates/tui/src/**/snapshots` or `crates/tui/src/snapshots`.
- Review snapshot diffs intentionally; do not treat them as noise.
- If you edit `crates/tui/src/bottom_pane/*`, also follow `crates/tui/src/bottom_pane/AGENTS.md`:
  - keep `chat_composer.rs` / `paste_burst.rs` module docs aligned
  - update `docs/tui-chat-composer.md` when behavior changes

## Gateway And Frontend Notes

- `scripts/build-web.ps1` is the canonical frontend build/sync script.
- That script fingerprints frontend inputs, skips unnecessary rebuilds, and syncs Dioxus output into both the frontend `out_dir` and `crates/gateway-server/static`.
- When you change `crates/gateway-dioxus` or `crates/gateway-shared`, verify the web build still succeeds and that the gateway can serve the updated static assets.
- `crates/gateway-server/src/ws_rpc` carries a large compatibility-heavy JSON-RPC surface. Preserve existing method names and aliases unless the change explicitly intends to break or version the protocol.

### Icons (Lucide)

The web frontend (`gateway-dioxus`) uses [Lucide](https://lucide.dev) icons via the [`lucide-dioxus`](https://crates.io/crates/lucide-dioxus) crate (MIT license). This replaces all previous text/emoji/unicode character icons.

- **Dependency**: `lucide-dioxus` with `all-icons` feature in workspace `Cargo.toml`.
- **Usage**: Import individual icon components and use them in `rsx!`:
  ```rust
  use lucide_dioxus::{Home, Settings, Bot};
  rsx! { Home { size: 16 } }
  ```
- **Props**: `size` (usize, default 24), `color` (String, default "currentColor"), `stroke_width` (usize, default 2), `class`, `style`.
- **Convention**: Navigation icons use `size: 16`, page header icons use `size: 20`, inline status icons use `size: 14`.
- **Do not** reintroduce text characters, unicode escapes, or emoji as icons. All new icons must use Lucide components.
- Browse available icons at [lucide.dev/icons](https://lucide.dev/icons).

## Generated Artifacts

- If you change config schema-bearing types in `savfox-core` or `savfox-config`, regenerate `crates/core/config.schema.json`:

```bash
cargo run -p savfox-core --bin savfox-write-config-schema
```

- If you change app-server protocol shapes, validate them with:

```bash
cargo test -p savfox-app-server-protocol
```

- When you need fresh exported protocol artifacts for inspection or downstream consumers, use one of:

```bash
cargo run --bin savfox -- app-server generate-ts --out <DIR>
cargo run --bin savfox -- app-server generate-json-schema --out <DIR>
cargo run -p savfox-app-server-protocol --bin write_schema_fixtures -- --schema-root <DIR>
```

## Docs

- Update nearby docs or README files when behavior changes are user-visible or contract-visible, especially for:
  - CLI commands and flags
  - gateway HTTP/WebSocket behavior
  - app-server protocol behavior
  - config shape and config semantics
  - TUI interaction model
- The repo has both English and Chinese docs under `docs/en` and `docs/zh`. If you touch a documented public surface, keep the relevant documentation aligned rather than leaving the change implicit in code.
