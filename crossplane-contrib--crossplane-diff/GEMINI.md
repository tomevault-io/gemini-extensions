# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Development Commands

### Building and Testing

```bash
# Build the binary for your platform
earthly +build

# Run unit and integration tests (fast, ~7s)
# Direct go test - fastest, immediate output
cd cmd/diff
go test ./...

# Via Earthly (ensures consistent environment, caches dependencies)
earthly +go-test

# Run a specific test
go test ./cmd/diff/diffprocessor -run TestCachedFunctionProvider -v

# Run a single test file
go test ./cmd/diff/diffprocessor/diff_processor_test.go -v

# Check test coverage
go test -cover ./cmd/diff/diffprocessor/... -coverprofile=/tmp/coverage.out
go tool cover -func=/tmp/coverage.out

# Pre-PR checks: linting, tests, generation (requires long timeout, can take several minutes)
earthly -P +reviewable

# Fetch Crossplane cluster CRDs (required after Crossplane API changes or for integration tests)
earthly +fetch-crossplane-cluster --CROSSPLANE_IMAGE_TAG=main

# Tidy go modules
earthly +generate
```

**Earthly Output Notes:**
- By default, Earthly buffers stdout and stderr separately, which can cause interleaved output
- Use `2>&1` to merge streams for chronological output: `earthly +go-test 2>&1 | tee output.log`

### End-to-End Tests

E2E tests run against real kind clusters with Crossplane installed. They can take several minutes to complete.

```bash
# Full E2E matrix against multiple Crossplane versions (slow, runs serially)
earthly -P +e2e-matrix

# Single E2E test against specific Crossplane version
earthly +e2e --CROSSPLANE_IMAGE_TAG=main

# Run specific E2E test with verbose logging
earthly -P +e2e --FLAGS="-v=4 -test.run ^TestCompositionDiff"

# Debug E2E: stop on first failure and preserve kind cluster
earthly -i -P +e2e --FLAGS="-test.failfast -fail-fast -destroy-kind-cluster=false"

# Run E2E tests directly (without Earthly wrapper for easier debugging)
go test -c -o e2e ./test/e2e
./e2e -v=4 -test.v -test.failfast -destroy-kind-cluster=false -test.run ^TestSpecificTest
```

**IMPORTANT**: Never interrupt running tests to try a simpler approach. E2E tests take a long time but that's expected. Killing them wastes the effort up to that point.

**Test Output Management**: Tests can take several minutes to run. Always save test output to an intermediate file before processing:
```bash
# Good: Save to file first, then query
earthly -P +e2e --test_name=TestFoo 2>&1 | tee /tmp/test-output.log
grep -A50 "FAIL" /tmp/test-output.log

# Bad: Pipe directly to grep (wastes test run if you need different info)
earthly -P +e2e --test_name=TestFoo 2>&1 | grep "FAIL"
```

**Debugging Test Failures**: When E2E tests fail, check `_output/tests/e2e-tests.xml` for complete, un-truncated failure output:
```bash
# Extract specific test failure from XML (includes full output)
grep -A 100 "TestDiffCompositionWithGetComposedResource" _output/tests/e2e-tests.xml

# Note: Earthly output quirks
# - First emits the failure
# - Then emits the log of the run
# - Finally repeats the failure with "*failed*" prepended to each line
```

### Running the CLI

```bash
# Build and run locally
earthly +build
./_output/bin/darwin_arm64/crossplane-diff xr test-xr.yaml

# XR diff - compare XR against cluster state
crossplane-diff xr my-xr.yaml
crossplane-diff xr my-xr.yaml --compact --no-color

# Composition diff - see impact of composition changes on existing XRs
crossplane-diff comp updated-composition.yaml
crossplane-diff comp updated-composition.yaml -n production --include-manual
```

## Architecture

```

### Key Architectural Patterns

1. **Dependency Injection via Factory Pattern**
   - Processors are configured using functional options pattern (`ProcessorOption`)
   - Dependencies flow inward: CLI layer → Application layer → Domain layer → Client layer
   - Factories at top level (CLI) control construction strategies (e.g., cached vs. default function providers)

2. **Interface-Based Design**
   - All major components defined as interfaces (`DiffProcessor`, `CompDiffProcessor`, `FunctionProvider`, etc.)
   - Enables easy mocking for unit tests via `testutils/mock_builder.go`
   - Mock builders use fluent API: `tu.NewMockFunctionClient().WithSuccessfulFunctionsFetch(fns).Build()`

3. **Lazy Loading and Caching**
   - `CachedFunctionProvider`: Lazy-loads functions per composition, caches by composition name
   - Docker container reuse: Adds annotations to enable container reuse across renders
   - Caching decisions made at CLI layer, not embedded in processors

4. **Composition Pipeline**
   - XR diff: Processes single XRs or multiple XRs independently
   - Comp diff: Finds all XRs using a composition, diffs each against updated composition
   - Nested XRs: Recursive processing with configurable depth limit (`--max-nested-depth`)
   - Requirements: Iterative rendering to resolve environment configs and external dependencies

### Critical Implementation Details

**Function Pipeline Integration**
- Functions fetched from cluster or provided via factory
- Docker containers may be orphaned after diff (TODO: cleanup mechanism)
- Functions are tied to compositions; cached provider reuses containers across XR renders

**Resource Validation**
- Schema validation against CRDs/XRDs before diffing
- Scope validation: Namespaced XRs cannot own cluster-scoped resources (except Claims)
- Namespace propagation: XR namespace propagates to managed resources in Crossplane v2

**Claim Label Behavior (Empirically Verified)**
Crossplane ALWAYS uses the XR name for the `crossplane.io/composite` label on composed resources, even when rendering from a Claim.

Evidence from empirical testing (2025-11-18):
```yaml
# Claim: my-test-claim (namespace: claim-test-ns)
# XR: my-test-claim-mjwln (cluster-scoped, auto-generated suffix)
# Composed NopResource labels:
labels:
  crossplane.io/claim-name: my-test-claim           # Points to Claim
  crossplane.io/claim-namespace: claim-test-ns      # Claim namespace
  crossplane.io/composite: my-test-claim-mjwln      # Points to XR, NOT Claim!
```

Key implications:
- When diffing Claims, the `crossplane.io/composite` label should NOT change between renders
- Crossplane templates use `{{ .observed.composite.resource.metadata.name }}` which is the XR name
- The XR is the actual composite owner; the Claim just references it via `spec.resourceRef`
- Test expectations must reflect this: NO label changes when modifying existing Claims
- This behavior is consistent across Crossplane versions

**New Claim Handling with spec.claimRef**
When diffing a new Claim (one that doesn't exist in the cluster yet), compositions may reference `spec.claimRef` fields like `{{ .observed.composite.resource.spec.claimRef.name }}`. Since `claimRef` is only populated by Crossplane on the backing XR at runtime, we synthesize a dummy backing XR with:
- The XR kind/apiVersion derived from the XRD
- A synthesized `spec.claimRef` containing the claim's apiVersion, kind, name, and namespace
- All spec fields from the claim copied to the XR
- A generated UID for the dummy XR

This allows compositions using claimRef to render correctly during diff operations for new claims.

**Diff Calculation**
- Compares rendered resources against cluster state via server-side dry-run
- Detects additions, modifications, and removals
- Handles `generateName` by matching via labels/annotations (`crossplane.io/composition-resource-name`)
- Uses two-phase approach to correctly handle nested XRs:
  1. **Phase 1 - Non-removal diffs**: `CalculateNonRemovalDiffs` computes diffs for all rendered resources
  2. **Phase 2 - Removal detection**: `CalculateRemovedResourceDiffs` identifies resources to be removed
  - This separation is critical because nested XRs must be processed before detecting removals
  - Nested XRs may render additional composed resources that shouldn't be marked as removals

**Resource Management**
- `ResourceManager` handles all resource fetching and cluster state operations
- Key responsibilities:
  - `FetchCurrentObject`: Retrieves existing resource from cluster (for identity preservation)
  - `FetchObservedResources`: Fetches resource tree to find all composed resources (including nested)
  - `UpdateOwnerReferences`: Updates owner references with dry-run annotations
- Separation of concerns: `DiffCalculator` focuses on diff logic, `ResourceManager` handles cluster I/O
- Identity preservation: Fetches existing nested XRs to maintain their cluster identity across renders

## Design Principles

### Accuracy Above All Else

The tool prioritizes **accuracy over convenience**:

- Never silently continues in the face of failures
- Avoids making best-guesses that could compromise accuracy
- Fails completely rather than emit potentially incorrect partial results
- For multiple XRs: Emit results only for those that succeed, call attention to failures
- Reaches extensively into cluster for all information needed (functions, compositions, requirements, CRDs)
- Caches resources only to avoid API throttling

### Error Handling Philosophy

- All errors should cause complete failure of the diff
- Emit useful logging with appropriate contextual objects attached
- Do not emit partial results for a given XR
- When diffing multiple resources, it's acceptable to emit results for successful ones while reporting failures for others

### Machine-Readable Error Handling

When using structured output (`--output json` or `--output yaml`):

1. **Errors go to BOTH places**: Write errors to stderr (for human visibility) AND include them in the structured output (for machine parsing). This ensures:
   - CI/CD tools can parse errors programmatically from stdout
   - Humans see errors immediately in stderr
   - The structured output is always valid JSON/YAML, even when errors occur

2. **Consistent error structure**: Use the same `OutputError` type (defined in `renderer/types/types.go`) across all commands:
   ```go
   type OutputError struct {
       ResourceID string `json:"resourceID,omitempty"` // optional - identifies which resource failed
       Message    string `json:"message"`              // required - the error message
   }
   ```
   Note: Only JSON tags are used because `sigs.k8s.io/yaml` uses JSON tags for YAML serialization.

3. **Always render output**: Even if all operations fail, render valid structured output with errors. Never return before rendering in structured output mode.

### Testing Requirements

**E2E Test Composition Structure**
- Every test composition MUST end with `function-auto-ready`
- This causes status conditions to bubble up from child resources
- Required for proper setup and teardown to work correctly

**Test Coverage Expectations**
- New code should have comprehensive unit test coverage
- Use table-driven tests for multiple scenarios
- Mock external dependencies using `testutils/mock_builder.go`
- Integration tests use `envtest` for realistic cluster interactions

**Working with ANSI Escape Codes in Test Expectations**

E2E test expectation files (`.ansi` files) contain actual ANSI escape sequences as binary data. These are extremely fragile when editing with shell tools.

**CRITICAL**: Never use `sed`, `perl`, or other shell text tools to directly edit ANSI codes in expectation files. They often:
- Double or triple escape sequences (e.g., `\x1b\x1b\x1b[32m` instead of `\x1b[32m`)
- Convert binary escape bytes to literal text (e.g., `[32m` instead of `\x1b[32m`)
- Corrupt the files in hard-to-debug ways

**Recommended Approach**: Use the Python script approach for reliable ANSI code manipulation:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# Script: scripts/fix-ansi-codes.py
import sys

def fix_ansi_codes(filepath):
    """Fix ANSI escape codes by removing duplicate escape bytes."""
    with open(filepath, 'rb') as f:
        content = f.read()

    # Replace triple/double escapes with single
    content = content.replace(b'\x1b\x1b\x1b[', b'\x1b[')
    content = content.replace(b'\x1b\x1b[', b'\x1b[')

    with open(filepath, 'wb') as f:
        f.write(content)
    print(f"Fixed {filepath}")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    for filepath in sys.argv[1:]:
        fix_ansi_codes(filepath)
```

Usage:
```bash
# Fix ANSI codes in test expectation files
python3 scripts/fix-ansi-codes.py test/e2e/manifests/beta/diff/main/*/expect/*.ansi

# Verify ANSI codes are correct (should show single \x1b before each [)
hexdump -C test/e2e/manifests/beta/diff/main/comp/expect/existing-xr.ansi | grep "1b 5b 33"
```

**Better Alternative**: Use `E2E_DUMP_EXPECTED=1` to auto-generate correct expectation files:
```bash
# Run tests with auto-dump to regenerate expectation files
earthly -P +e2e --FLAGS="-test.run TestSpecificTest" --E2E_DUMP_EXPECTED=1
```

**Structured JSON Testing (Preferred for New Tests)**

For semantic validation of diff output, prefer structured JSON assertions over ANSI golden files. JSON assertions:
- Eliminate ANSI escape code fragility
- Enable field-level assertions with exact old/new values
- Provide clearer error messages (e.g., `spec.forProvider.configData: expected 'old', got 'new'`)
- Support array indexing via k8s jsonpath syntax (e.g., `spec.pipeline[0].functionRef.name`)

The test helpers in `cmd/diff/testutils/structured_assertions.go` provide a fluent builder API:

```go
// XR diff assertions
tu.AssertStructuredDiff(t, jsonOutput, tu.ExpectDiff().
    WithSummary(1, 0, 0).  // added, modified, removed
    WithAddedResource("XNopResource", "test-resource", "default").
    WithField("spec.forProvider.configData", "new-value").
    And())

// Composition diff assertions with downstream field-level changes
tu.AssertStructuredCompDiff(t, jsonOutput, tu.ExpectCompDiff().
    WithComposition("xbuckets.example.org").
    WithCompositionModified().  // Assert composition itself is modified
    WithAffectedResources(2, 2, 0, 0).  // total, changed, unchanged, errors
    WithXRImpact("XBucket", "test-xr", "", "changed").
    WithDownstreamSummary(0, 1, 0).  // downstream adds, mods, removes
    WithDownstreamResource("modified", "Bucket", "", "").
    WithAnyName().  // Generated names with random suffix
    WithFieldChange("spec.forProvider.region", "us-east-1", "us-west-2").
    WithFieldAdded("spec.newSetting", "value").      // Field was added
    WithFieldRemoved("spec.deprecatedSetting", "old-value").  // Field was removed
    // Use bracket notation for keys with dots (like Kubernetes annotations)
    WithFieldValuePattern("metadata.annotations['example.org/ref']", `resource-[a-z0-9]+`).
    AndXR().
    AndComp().
    And())
```

**When to use which approach:**
- **JSON assertions**: Semantic tests (add/modify/remove resources, field-level changes, composition diffs)
- **ANSI golden files**: Visual formatting tests (color codes, `+++`/`~~~`/`---` markers, compact mode)

Keep a small set of ANSI tests (~5-7) to smoke test visual output formatting.

## Code Modification Guidelines

### Minimizing Change Footprint
- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- When refactoring, back out changes that don't directly support the new architecture
- Keep processors simple: inject dependencies rather than constructing them internally
- Reuse injected instances (e.g., single `DiffProcessor` for all XRs) rather than creating new ones per operation

### Backwards Compatibility
- Support both Crossplane v1 and v2 API structures
- Handle both `spec.compositionUpdatePolicy` (v1) and `spec.crossplane.compositionUpdatePolicy` (v2)
- Default to `Automatic` update policy when not specified

### Correctness and Edge Cases
- Ensure every code modification strictly preserves correctness
- Robustly handle edge/corner cases related to the problem statement
- Avoid blanket or "quick fix" solutions that might hide errors
- Always strive to diagnose and address root causes, not symptoms
- Empty strings, nil maps, missing fields must all be handled correctly

## Upstream Dependencies

### Crossplane Render Nested XR Fix (Resolved)

**Upstream PR:** https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/pull/6957 (backported to v2.1.4 via #6974)

**Issue:** `crossplane render`'s `SetComposedResourceMetadata` function didn't properly propagate the root composite's identity through nested XR trees. It always used `xr.GetName()` for the `crossplane.io/composite` label instead of checking if the XR already has the label set.

**Resolution:** This was fixed upstream and backported to Crossplane v2.1.4. The fix checks `xr.GetLabels()[AnnotationKeyCompositeName]` before falling back to `xr.GetName()`, mirroring the behavior in Crossplane's actual `RenderComposedResourceMetadata` function.

As of crossplane-diff's update to Crossplane v2.1.4, no workarounds are needed - the render pipeline correctly propagates composite labels through nested XR trees.
