# Working in this repository

This is a Home Assistant custom integration for DHL eCommerce NL parcel
tracking. Distributed via HACS; not part of HA core.

## Always consult HA developer documentation

Home Assistant's integration patterns evolve continuously. **Do not rely
on memory of past patterns** — fetch the canonical page before changing
a topic area, and check the developer blog before introducing anything
you only "know" from training data.

| When you change | Fetch first |
|---|---|
| Entity properties, naming, lifecycle, attributes | https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/core/entity/ |
| Sensor specifics (state/device classes, units) | https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/core/entity/sensor |
| Config flow, options flow, reauth, reconfigure | https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/config_entries_config_flow_handler |
| DataUpdateCoordinator pattern | https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/integration_fetching_data |

| Diagnostics | https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/core/integration/diagnostics |
| Translations | https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/internationalization/core |

Branding is handled by the local `brand/` folder (HACS reads `icon.png`
from it). The official `home-assistant/brands` repo is for HA Core
integrations and does not apply here.

### Recent developer-facing changes

Before introducing patterns you only know from training data, check:

- https://developers.home-assistant.io/blog — API deprecations, new
  patterns, breaking changes. Recent posts trump older recollection.
- https://github.com/home-assistant/architecture/discussions — design
  decisions in flight that have not made it into stable docs yet.

## What is already in place

The integration is aligned with the **silver** quality scale tier. Don't
re-propose these as improvements:

- `quality_scale: "silver"` in manifest, minimum HA version `2024.7.0`
- `ConfigEntry.runtime_data` (typed dataclass `DhlData`)
- `PARALLEL_UPDATES = 0` in `sensor.py`
- Coordinator takes `config_entry=entry` so `self.config_entry` is
  available on the base class
- Per-parcel sensors are removed by the summary sensor
  (`DhlIncomingParcelsSensor`) via `entity_registry.async_remove(entity_id)`
  when a barcode drops out of the coordinator data. The earlier
  self-remove pattern raced with coordinator-listener cleanup and left
  ghost entities behind — do not revert.
- Reauth flow uses `async_update_reload_and_abort` (one helper call
  instead of update + reload + abort). The confirm step also guards with
  `async_set_unique_id` + `_abort_if_unique_id_mismatch` so entering a
  *different* DHL account's credentials aborts instead of silently
  rebinding the entry to another account.
- **Auth-error split in `api.py`**: `async_login` raises `DhlAuthError`
  only on 401/403; any other non-200 (a 5xx outage) raises `DhlApiError`.
  Setup maps `DhlAuthError → ConfigEntryAuthFailed` (starts reauth) and
  `DhlApiError`/`ClientError → ConfigEntryNotReady` (retry with backoff).
  Do not collapse these again — a DHL outage must never push users into
  reauth.
- **First refresh runs in `__init__.py`, before `async_forward_entry_setups`.**
  Both coordinators call `async_config_entry_first_refresh()` in
  `async_setup_entry` (not in the `sensor.py` platform). Raising
  `ConfigEntryNotReady` from a *forwarded* platform is too late for HA to
  catch — it logs a warning and half-sets-up the entry (users saw only the
  button/calendar entities and no sensors). Doing the first refresh in
  `__init__` makes a transient fetch failure (e.g. a DHL **429**) fail the
  whole entry cleanly so HA retries with backoff. Do not move the first
  refresh back into a platform.
- The per-entry `ClientSession` is closed on every failed-setup path
  (login failure, a failing first refresh, and a failing platform forward)
  — without this each setup retry leaks a session.
- Diagnostics redact person/shop names: `name` (raw payloads) and the
  normalized top-level `receiver` are in `TO_REDACT`.
- `aiohttp.ClientError` is intentionally not caught in the coordinator —
  `DataUpdateCoordinator` wraps it automatically
- Diagnostics handler in `diagnostics.py` with credential and PII
  redaction
- Tests cover config flow, sensor, coordinator (incl. event firing),
  diagnostics, and setup/unload lifecycle
- `_unrecorded_attributes` on every summary sensor — parcel/shipment
  lists are kept out of the recorder long-term tables
- `_attr_attribution = "Data provided by DHL"` per entity

### Adopted in 2.0.0 (do not refactor away)

- **`ParcelStatus` enum** in `const.py` — canonical
  carrier-agnostic statuses. `normalize_parcel` maps the raw DHL
  status/category via `map_parcel_status` and reports `ParcelStatus.UNKNOWN`
  (with one-shot info log) for anything not yet in the map. The original
  DHL status string lives on the parcel's `raw_status` field; do not
  re-introduce it on `status`.
- **Events**: the coordinator fires `dhl_nl_parcel_registered`,
  `dhl_nl_parcel_status_changed` and `dhl_nl_parcel_delivery_time_changed`
  on the HA event bus. Events are suppressed on the very first refresh
  so we do not flood users with "registered" events for parcels that
  already existed. ``delivery_time_changed`` only fires when at least
  one of ``planned_from`` / ``planned_to`` ends up with a non-null
  value that differs from the previous one — ``value → null`` drops
  the ETA and is intentionally silent (carrier just lost the window;
  not worth a notification).
- **`has_entity_name = True`** on every entity, with `translation_key`
  routing names through `strings.json` and the language files. Drop
  `_attr_name` is the rule — translations are the source of truth.
- **Translated unit-of-measurement** (`entity.sensor.<key>.unit_of_measurement`
  in strings/translations). `_attr_native_unit_of_measurement` is
  intentionally absent.
- **`icons.json`** holds all sensor icons via the `translation_key`. Do
  not re-introduce `_attr_icon` on the sensor classes.
- **Device name pattern**: `"DHL (<email>)"`. Sensors auto-prefix with
  this, yielding friendly names like
  `DHL (account@example.com) Incoming parcels`.

### Adopted in 2.1.0 (do not refactor away)

- **Carrier-agnostic `receiver`, `weight`, `dimensions`** on every
  parcel. `receiver` is sourced from DHL's `receiver.name`; `weight` and
  `dimensions` stay `None` here because DHL's consumer API does not
  expose them — kept on the shape for parity with DPD and PostNL so the
  aggregator and cross-carrier dashboards can read every carrier the
  same way.
- **Configurable refresh interval** via the options flow
  (`CONF_REFRESH_INTERVAL`; 15, 30, 60, 120 or 240 minutes; default 30).
  The form is split into `delivered` and `polling` sections via
  `data_entry_flow.section`. **Deliberate divergence** from the
  `ha-integration-knowledge` skill rule "polling intervals are NOT
  user-configurable": that rule targets HA Core integrations; this is a
  HACS integration where a user-tunable poll cadence is a wanted feature.
  Do not "fix" this to match the core rule.
- **No `entry.add_update_listener`** — the OptionsFlow calls
  `self.hass.config_entries.async_schedule_reload(entry.entry_id)` on
  submit so a changed refresh interval takes effect immediately. Reauth
  still reloads via `async_update_reload_and_abort` (that is correct and
  unrelated). Combining an update listener with a reload-on-update flow
  is logged as a deprecation today and becomes an error in HA 2026.12+ —
  see the
  [config_entry_listener deprecation](https://developers.home-assistant.io/blog/2026/05/07/config-entry-listener-together-with-reloading-methods/).

### Adopted in 2.3.0 — history (do not refactor away)

- **Per-parcel `history`** — a new top-level canonical field (alongside
  `status`, `raw_status`, …): an ordered list (oldest → newest) of
  `{timestamp, status, raw_status}` events, capped to the most recent
  `HISTORY_MAX_EVENTS` (20). DHL has no human event text, so a history
  entry's `raw_status` is the event **`key`** (a code), mirroring how the
  parcel-level `raw_status` is the carrier's own status string. Kept
  identical across DHL / DPD / PostNL; top-level (not under `raw`) so it
  survives the aggregator's `strip_raw()`.
- **New API call** — history is NOT on the parcels list endpoint. It
  comes from the track-trace endpoint (`TRACK_TRACE_URL`), added as
  `DhlApiClient.async_get_track_trace(barcode, postal_code, parcel_id)`.
  Query: `key={barcode}+{postalCode}` (yarl encodes `+` → `%2B`),
  `role=consumer-receiver`, `uuid={parcelId}`. The postcode is the
  **receiver's** (`parcel.receiver.address.postalCode`), the uuid is
  `parcel.parcelId` — both from the list endpoint. The response is
  `text/plain`, so the client parses with `json.loads(await r.text())`,
  not `r.json()`. Best-effort: any failure returns `None` and never
  breaks the poll.
- **Opt-in, default OFF.** Options-flow boolean `CONF_INCLUDE_HISTORY`
  in its own `history` section, `async_schedule_reload` on submit (same
  pattern as `CONF_REFRESH_INTERVAL`). When off, `history` is `None` —
  the key is never omitted.
- **Cost control via `_history_cache`** (`barcode -> {history,
  _raw_status}`). `_enrich_history` runs only when the option is on, for
  **active + delivered** incoming parcels, and only calls track-trace on
  first sight of a barcode or when its raw `status` changes (history
  grows on a status change). Mirrors DPD's detail-cache thinking; the
  cache lives for the integration's lifetime (resets on HA restart). The
  sent-shipments coordinator does NOT fetch history — track-trace is a
  receiver-role endpoint; outgoing shipments keep `history = None`.
- **Per-event status reuses the parcel maps.** `map_event_status(key,
  phase)` tries `_STATUS_MAP[key]` (granular, more specific) then
  `_CATEGORY_MAP[phase]` (the DHL `phase` shares the `category`
  vocabulary). The phase fallback covers essentially every event, so we
  did NOT extend `_STATUS_MAP` with granular per-event keys (keeps
  `map_parcel_status` untouched). Unmapped → `null` (history) + one-shot
  warning.
- **Feature B — unknown-status warnings.** Both `map_parcel_status`
  (`[parcel] status=… category=…`) and `map_event_status` (`[history]
  key=… phase=…`) log **once per distinct unmapped value** at **WARNING**
  with a copy-paste `issues/new` link (`_NEW_ISSUE_URL`). Replaced the
  old terse info log. Two one-shot sets: `_unmapped_statuses_logged`,
  `_unmapped_event_keys_logged`.
- **Recorder:** `history` is in `_unrecorded_attributes` on
  `DhlParcelSensor`. Summary sensors already keep the parcel list out of
  the recorder via the `parcels` attribute. Observed event-key catalogue
  lives in `docs/api/track_trace.md` (local-only).

### Adopted in 2.4.0 — device triggers + refresh button (do not refactor away)

- **`device_id` on every fired event.** `_fire_change_events` resolves the
  account's device id once (cached in `self._cached_device_id`, looked up
  via `dr.async_entries_for_config_entry`) and adds `device_id` to all
  three event payloads. Stays `None` until the device exists, which is
  fine — events are suppressed on the first refresh anyway. This is the
  key that lets device triggers filter per-account.
- **`device_trigger.py`** exposes the three bus events
  (`parcel_registered` / `parcel_status_changed` /
  `parcel_delivery_time_changed`) as no-code device triggers. It delegates
  to `homeassistant.components.homeassistant.triggers.event`, filtering on
  `CONF_EVENT_DATA={device_id: ...}`. Trigger-type names live under
  `device_automation.trigger_type` in strings/translations. The `BUTTON`
  platform addition does **not** change the device-trigger wiring.
- **Refresh `button`** (`Platform.BUTTON` in `PLATFORMS`, `button.py`).
  One `DhlRefreshButton` per account, unique_id `{user_id}_refresh`,
  `translation_key="refresh"`. `async_press` calls
  `async_request_refresh()` on **both** the incoming and sent
  coordinators. Lands on the same `DHL (<email>)` device.
- **Sensor cleanup is now sensor-scoped.** The setup-time stale-entity
  loop in `sensor.py` filters on `entity_entry.domain == "sensor"` before
  treating a `{user_id}_*` unique_id as a per-parcel barcode. Without this
  guard it deletes the refresh button (`{user_id}_refresh`) on every
  setup, mistaking it for a delivered parcel. Do not drop the domain
  check.
- **Diagnostic `last_update` sensor** (`DhlLastUpdateSensor`, unique_id
  `{user_id}_last_update`, `EntityCategory.DIAGNOSTIC`, device class
  TIMESTAMP). Reads `coordinator.last_success_time`, which the incoming
  `DhlCoordinator` stamps with `datetime.now(timezone.utc)` at the end of
  every successful `_async_update_data`. Lets users alert on a silently
  stale integration (the count sensors only change on a value change).
  **Must be in `non_parcel_unique_ids`** in `sensor.py` — it is a sensor
  whose unique_id starts with `{user_id}_`, so without the exclusion the
  setup cleanup loop deletes it as a stale parcel.
- **Deliveries `calendar`** (`Platform.CALENDAR` in `PLATFORMS`,
  `calendar.py`). One `DhlDeliveriesCalendar` per account, unique_id
  `{user_id}_deliveries`, `translation_key="deliveries"`. Read-only view
  over `coordinator.data` — **no extra API calls**, so it is enabled by
  default (no options toggle — it is a pure read-only view over data we
  already have). One `CalendarEvent` per active incoming parcel that
  has a `planned_from`; `end` is `planned_to` or `planned_from + 1h` when
  only a moment is known. `event` returns the soonest event whose `end >
  dt_util.now()`. Summary = sender (falls back to barcode); pickup
  parcels set `location` to the ServicePoint name. A combined cross-carrier
  calendar belongs in the **aggregator**, not here (carrier repos stay
  independent).

### Adopted in 2.5.0 — return parcels folded into "outgoing" (do not refactor away)

- **Returns come from the parcels list, not the sent-shipments endpoint.**
  A return label generated by a webshop makes the account holder the
  *receiver* of the original parcel, not the sender of record — so it
  never appears via `async_get_sent_shipments()` /
  `DhlSentShipmentsCoordinator`. It does appear in the same
  `async_get_parcels()` payload as incoming parcels, tagged
  `isReturn: true`. `filter_active_returns()` / `filter_delivered_returns()`
  in `coordinator.py` split those out of the raw parcels list by category,
  mirroring `filter_active_parcels()` / `filter_delivered_parcels()` (which
  now explicitly exclude them — they always did, this just gives the
  excluded set somewhere to go instead of being silently dropped). Stored
  as `DhlCoordinator.returning` / `.delivered_outgoing`.
- **`isReturn` is an internal filter only — it does not leak into entity
  names.** A DHL-specific `returning_parcels` sensor was tried and
  deliberately reverted: externally a return is just one more way a
  parcel becomes *outgoing*, exactly like PostNL's model. Do not
  reintroduce a separate "return" sensor — merge new return-adjacent data
  into the existing outgoing sensors instead.
- **`DhlSentShipmentsSensor` (`{user_id}_outgoing_parcels`) now merges two
  sources**: `sent_coordinator.data` (own-sender shipments — almost always
  empty, see above) and `coordinator.returning`, combined and re-sorted
  with `sort_parcels_by_ts`. It is a `CoordinatorEntity[DhlCoordinator]`
  but **also subscribes to `sent_coordinator`** in `async_added_to_hass`
  (`async_on_remove(sent_coordinator.async_add_listener(...))`) so an
  update from either coordinator refreshes the sensor — do not drop this,
  reading a second coordinator's data without subscribing would leave the
  sensor stale until the main coordinator next polls.
- **New `DhlOutgoingDeliveredSensor` (`{user_id}_outgoing_delivered_parcels`)**
  merges `sent_coordinator.delivered` with `coordinator.delivered_outgoing`
  the same way. `DhlSentShipmentsCoordinator` gained a `delivered`
  attribute and `filter_delivered_sent_shipments()` for this — previously
  it only ever tracked active shipments and threw delivered ones away.
- **`_apply_delivered_filter` / `_delivery_dt` are now module-level
  functions** (`_apply_delivered_filter(parcels, entry)`) instead of
  `DhlCoordinator` methods, so `DhlSentShipmentsCoordinator` can reuse the
  same days/count delivered-filter option. `DhlCoordinator._apply_delivered_filter`
  still exists as a thin instance-method wrapper — do not remove it, tests
  call it directly.
- Both `outgoing_parcels` and `outgoing_delivered_parcels` **must** stay in
  `non_parcel_unique_ids` in `sensor.py` (the first already did).
- **No history for returns.** `_enrich_history` is still called only with
  `active + delivered` (incoming); track-trace is a receiver-role endpoint
  and returns keep `history: None`.

### Adopted after 2.5.0 — outgoing events (do not refactor away)

- **Two outgoing events fire from `DhlCoordinator`**:
  `dhl_nl_outgoing_parcel_status_changed` and
  `dhl_nl_outgoing_parcel_delivered`, via `_fire_outgoing_change_events`,
  over the combined `returning + delivered_outgoing` set (so a hop from
  in-transit to delivered is visible in one set). State tracked in
  `_known_outgoing_state` (barcode → ParcelStatus), `None` on the first
  refresh for the same suppression reason as `_known_state`.
- **`delivered` takes precedence over `status_changed`** for the terminal
  transition: a change **to** `ParcelStatus.DELIVERED` fires only
  `_delivered`, every other change fires only `_status_changed`. So the
  final hop fires exactly one (dedicated) event, never both.
- **No outgoing `registered` and no outgoing `delivery_time_changed`** —
  deliberately out of scope. A return seen for the first time (not yet in
  `_known_outgoing_state`) fires nothing; it can only fire once a later
  refresh sees it change. An already-delivered return never fires (its
  status did not change).
- **Source is `DhlCoordinator` (returns), not `DhlSentShipmentsCoordinator`.**
  Own-sender shipments are ~always empty for DHL consumers (see above), so
  the sent-shipments coordinator does not fire events — the meaningful
  outgoing data is the returns list. Both events carry `device_id` and are
  wired into `device_trigger.py` (`outgoing_parcel_status_changed` /
  `outgoing_parcel_delivered`) with labels under
  `device_automation.trigger_type` in strings/translations.

## Planned for the next major bump

- **Exception translations** (Gold-tier rule). `UpdateFailed(f"...")`
  still uses f-strings; the Gold push will move to `translation_key` +
  `translation_placeholders`.

## Deliberately skipped (no plan to change)

- **Slimming `extra_state_attributes`** on summary sensors. The full
  parcel list stays; `_unrecorded_attributes` handles the recorder side.
- **`async-dependency` / `inject-websession`** (Platinum). The DHL API
  client is already async and accepts an injected session — no further
  work needed there. Listed for completeness.

## Repo-specific quirks

- Each config entry uses its **own aiohttp `CookieJar`** (see
  `__init__.py`) so two DHL accounts don't overwrite each other's auth
  cookies. Do not refactor this to share the HA-managed session's jar.
- `_get_en_route_parcels` / `_get_pickup_parcels` filter on
  `ParcelStatus.AT_PICKUP_POINT`. The DHL-specific raw status that maps
  to that value is `NOTIFICATION_FOR_PARCELSHOP_COLLECTION_HAS_BEEN_SENT`
  — kept as `STATUS_AT_SERVICE_POINT` in `const.py` for the mapping
  table in `coordinator.py`.
- Network calls return raw JSON dicts; there is no DTO layer.

## Running tests

```
python -m pytest tests/ --cov=custom_components.dhl_nl
```

Coverage must stay **above 95%** (the silver `test-coverage` rule on
developers.home-assistant.io). Run before committing.
