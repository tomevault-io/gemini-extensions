# Agent Notes

This repository is intended to stay easy to launch for contributors evaluating the idea.

The sections below are the quick reference. They summarize the boundaries; the detailed sections later in this file (Development, Modules, Database, UI) and the docs in `docs/` remain authoritative.

## Always

- Match the task to the **Task Router** below and read the relevant `docs/` guide before researching or coding. A task can match multiple rows — read all of them.
- Run `yarn check` and `yarn test` before handing work back; add `yarn typecheck` whenever TypeScript, API contracts, server code, or React behavior changes. Auto-fix formatting first with `yarn biome check --write .`. For a full repo health check before handoff, run the single command: `yarn validate:all`.
- Run `yarn generate` after changing module files or `solivio.config.ts` — the generated registries and app-router stubs are how module code reaches the app. (`yarn dev` keeps a generator watcher running for you.)
- Keep feature code in modules (`modules/<id>/src/`); modules depend only on `@solivio/sdk` and the shared packages (`@solivio/ui`, `@solivio/theme`, `@solivio/domain`), and reach shared infrastructure only through `@solivio/sdk/runtime` accessors.
- Read each module's own `AGENTS.md` (e.g. `modules/customers/AGENTS.md`) before changing it; `modules/products-sync` is the reference example exercising every module surface.
- Change database schema only through committed Drizzle migrations in the owning journal (`yarn db:generate` for core, `yarn db:generate <moduleId>` for a module) and verify with `yarn db:check`.
- Build UI from the shared shadcn/ui kit in `packages/ui` and Tailwind utilities; check https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components before writing a new component.
- Use mocks until the data model and integration boundaries are clear, and keep setup commands simple and documented.
- After a correction, record a rule in `docs/lessons.md` (see **Self-improvement**) so the same mistake cannot recur.

## Ask First

- Before changing architecture, the public `@solivio/sdk` contract surface, or the module/SDK boundary (`docs/contracts.md`).
- Before changing the generator (`scripts/generate/`) or the shape of its emitted artifacts (`docs/codegen.md`).
- Before adding a required external service to the default demo path, or adding a production dependency.
- Before applying migrations in any shared or non-local environment.
- Before reducing scope or changing behavior the user or a doc did not explicitly ask to change.

## Never

- Never edit `apps/solivio/src/generated/` or the generated app trees (`apps/solivio/src/app/(protected)/(gen)/`, `(gen-public)/`, `api/(gen)/`) — they are generator-owned, gitignored, and overwritten by `yarn generate`.
- Never import another module at runtime — cross-module calls go through `getService()` and typed events only. The one sanctioned exception is a **type-only** import of a dependency module's `services.ts` (erased at runtime) to pull its `Services` augmentation into the typecheck.
- Never make a module import app internals (`@/...`, `@solivio/app`) — modules depend only on `@solivio/sdk` and the shared packages.
- Never SQL-join another module's tables. Cross-module references are id-only columns (no FK constraints); fetch display data through batch service lookups (`findByIds`-style).
- Never name a module table anything other than `<module_id>` or `<module_id>_*` (snake_case, hyphens in the module id become underscores; see `docs/database.md`).
- Never run module code at import time that touches the runtime (`getDb()`, `getService()`, `getAi()`, …) — instantiate agents and resolve services lazily inside handlers/factories; the runtime boots in `instrumentation.ts` after modules are imported.
- Never import the Drizzle client (`apps/solivio/src/server/database/db.ts`) outside `apps/solivio/src/server/` or `apps/solivio/src/app/api/`; module code uses `getDb()`/`db` from `@solivio/sdk/runtime` with its own `data/schema.ts` tables.
- Never write custom CSS classes or add rules to `globals.css` beyond the allowed blocks, and never hard-code theme colors — use the theme tokens.
- Never add required external services to the default demo path.

## Validation Commands

Choose the smallest relevant set for the change:

```bash
yarn validate:all            # full repo health/handoff suite: env, immutable install, validate, db:check, build, setup, e2e
yarn validate                # the PR gate: generate --check + biome/boundaries + typecheck + Vitest
yarn biome check --write .   # format, sort imports, apply safe lint fixes
yarn generate                # regenerate module wiring (add --check to validate only)
yarn check                   # Biome quality gate + module boundary checker (CI runs this)
yarn test                    # Vitest suite
yarn typecheck               # when TS, API contracts, server code, or React behavior changes
yarn dedupe --check          # verify lockfile deduplication after dependency changes (`yarn dedupe` fixes it)
yarn db:check                # journals match schemas (core + every module journal)
yarn e2e                     # Playwright against http://localhost:3000 (yarn setup first)
```

Scaffold a new module with `yarn create-module <id>`; load demo data with `yarn seed`.

## Task Router — Where to Find Detailed Guidance

Before research or coding, match the task to a row and read the linked guide. A single task often matches multiple rows — read all of them.

| Task | Guide |
|------|-------|
| Building or changing a module — anatomy, services/events, pages/API routes, jobs, capabilities, boundaries | `docs/module-system.md` + the module's own `AGENTS.md` + this file → **Modules** |
| The generator (`yarn generate`) — inputs, emitted artifacts, validations, watch/check modes | `docs/codegen.md` |
| What the public SDK/module contract surface is — what is stable and what modules may import | `docs/contracts.md` |
| AI agents — which module owns which agent, agent tools, per-role models | `docs/agents.md` |
| Overall architecture, layering, and module boundaries | `docs/architecture.md` |
| Database schema, per-owner migration journals, or the entity-relationship model | `docs/database.md` + `docs/erd.md` |
| HTTP API routes and their conventions | `docs/api.md` |
| Operator overlays — running custom modules without forking (`yarn overlay`) | `docs/codegen.md` → Config resolution + public guide `apps/docs/.../guides/extending.md` |
| Building/publishing images, deployment | `docs/publishing.md` + this file → **Build** / **Deploy** |
| Product scope and what the MVP includes | `docs/mvp-scope.md` |
| Testing strategy, unit/module tests, E2E scope, or CI validation | `docs/testing.md` |
| Why a load-bearing technical decision was made | `docs/adr/` |

## Working with Subagents

Offload research and parallel analysis to subagents to keep the main context clean. Give each subagent a single, focused task. Prefer subagents for broad searches across many files where you only need the conclusion.

## Self-improvement

After the user corrects you, append a dated entry to `docs/lessons.md`. If the lesson is a durable rule, also fold it into the relevant **Always** / **Never** list above or the matching `docs/` guide, written so the same mistake cannot repeat.

## Development

```bash
yarn install
cp apps/solivio/.env.example apps/solivio/.env.local   # set BETTER_AUTH_SECRET via `openssl rand -base64 32`
yarn setup                                              # docker compose up db, wait for it, generate module wiring, run migrations
yarn dev                                                # generator in watch mode + Next.js on :3000
```

`yarn setup` must run on a fresh checkout before `yarn dev`, and again whenever new Drizzle migrations are added. `yarn db:migrate` applies pending migrations (the core journal plus every enabled module's journal) without restarting the database.

`yarn generate` reads `solivio.config.ts`, discovers each enabled module's files by convention, validates the module graph, and emits the registries and app-router stubs the app builds against. It runs inside `yarn setup`, `yarn dev` (watch mode), and `yarn build`, so it rarely needs to be invoked by hand — but stale wiring after a manual module change is fixed by running it.

## Code Quality

Biome is the single formatting, linting, and import-organization tool for this repository.

Agents may ignore formatting noise while actively editing, but must normalize and verify their work before handing it back:

```bash
yarn biome check --write .   # formats, sorts imports, and applies safe lint fixes
yarn check                   # Biome + scripts/check-boundaries.mts (module import boundaries)
```

Use `yarn check` as the single repository quality gate. It includes the module boundary checker: modules may not import other modules or app internals, and handwritten app code may not import `@solivio/module-*` directly (only the generated registries do). Use `yarn test` for the Vitest suite.

Run `yarn typecheck` as well whenever TypeScript, API contracts, server code, or React component behavior changes. Run `yarn db:check` after schema work.

For final handoff or whenever you want to know whether the repository is healthy, use `yarn validate:all` instead of composing separate commands. It creates the ignored local validation env if missing, verifies the lockfile, checks formatting and generated wiring, runs the static gates, checks database drift, builds the app and docs, prepares the local database, and runs Playwright. It should not rewrite tracked source files; use `yarn biome check --write .` and `yarn generate` separately when you intentionally want fixes.

Playwright e2e tests use the normal local app path: `yarn setup` prepares Postgres, module wiring, and migrations, and `yarn e2e` runs against `http://localhost:3000` while starting `yarn dev` if needed. Do not add separate e2e setup scripts. CI (`.github/workflows/quality.yml`) runs `yarn generate`, `yarn check`, `yarn typecheck`, `yarn db:check`, prepares `.env.local`, runs `yarn setup`, and then runs `yarn e2e`.

## Build

Production images are produced via `docker-compose.build.yml`:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.build.yml build         # builds the app image
docker compose -f docker-compose.build.yml push          # pushes to GHCR (requires `docker login ghcr.io`)
```

This produces `ghcr.io/solivio-ai/solivio-app`, a Next.js standalone runtime. The Dockerfile runs `yarn generate` before `next build`, so the modules enabled in `solivio.config.ts` are compiled into the app. On startup the container applies committed Drizzle migrations — the core journal plus every enabled module's journal — before starting the server.

CI (`.github/workflows/build-image.yml`) runs the same commands on every push to `main` and tags the image with `:latest` and `:<commit-sha>`.

## Deploy

The demo runs on a single OVH VPS at `demo.solivio.ai` as three containers via `docker-compose.prod.yml`: Traefik (TLS), Postgres+pgvector, and the app. Manual deploy:

```bash
ssh ovh
cd /opt/solivio && git pull
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml pull
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

## Modules

Solivio is a modular monolith. A module is a TypeScript **source package** under `modules/<id>/` (no build step of its own); `yarn generate` discovers its files by convention and emits the wiring — registries under `apps/solivio/src/generated/` and Next.js app-router stubs under the `(gen)` trees — that compiles the module into the app. Enabling or disabling a module means editing `solivio.config.ts` and regenerating; there is no runtime loading. Out-of-tree modules are npm packages with `"solivio": { "module": true }` in `package.json`, enabled by adding the package name to `solivio.config.ts`.

Module anatomy (all parts optional; discovery is by file path):

| File | Contributes |
|------|-------------|
| `src/index.ts` | Manifest — default export `defineModule({ id, title, version, optionsSchema?, dependsOn?, routeGroup? })` |
| `src/services.ts` | `export const services` factories + `declare module "@solivio/sdk"` augmentation of `Services` |
| `src/events.ts` | Declaration-merged `Events` map (`<moduleId>.<entity>.<action>`) |
| `src/data/schema.ts` + `src/data/migrations/` | Module-owned Drizzle tables and the module's own migration journal |
| `src/api/**/route.ts` | HTTP routes under `/api/...` (stubbed into the app router) |
| `src/pages/**/page.tsx` | Pages (session-guarded by default; `routeGroup: "public"` opts out) |
| `src/components/` | Module-private React components |
| `src/subscribers/*.ts` | Event subscribers (`defineSubscriber`; `persistent: true` runs via the job queue) |
| `src/jobs/*.ts` | Background jobs (`defineJob`; optional cron schedule resolved at boot) |
| `src/ai/tools.ts`, `src/ai/importers.ts` | Agent tools and importer capabilities |
| `src/channels.ts` | Channel declarations — marks the module as a destination for a finalized entity; it receives the entity through slots and acts through its own routes/subscribers |
| `src/contracts/routes.ts` | OpenAPI route contracts merged into the API docs |
| `src/i18n/<locale>.json` | Translations, namespaced under the module id |
| `src/nav.tsx`, `src/slots.tsx` | Sidebar nav entries and slot contributions (client-safe) |
| `src/acl.ts` | `export const permissions` (must be `<moduleId>.`-prefixed) |
| `AGENTS.md` | The module's own working notes — read it first |

To add a module: create `modules/<id>/` with `package.json` (name `@solivio/module-<id>`, `"solivio": { "module": true }`), `tsconfig.json`, and `src/index.ts`; add the id to `solivio.config.ts` `modules`; run `yarn generate`. Mirror `modules/products-sync/` — it exercises every surface. Full details: `docs/module-system.md` and `docs/codegen.md`.

## Architecture

- `apps/solivio` owns the single Next.js app — the core: auth + `/admin/users`, the app shell and sidebar, runtime boot (`src/server/runtime/`, `instrumentation.ts`), the pg-boss jobs engine, `/api/health`, and the generated wiring.
- `modules/` owns the feature modules: `catalog`, `customers`, `offers`, `offer-chat`, `order-history`, `knowledge-base`, `csv-import`, `products-sync`.
- `sdk/` owns `@solivio/sdk` — the only contract modules build against (manifest types, registries, runtime accessors).
- `packages/domain` owns shared types, workflow constants, and mock fixtures; `packages/ui` the shared shadcn/ui kit; `packages/theme` the design tokens.
- `scripts/generate` owns the module generator; `scripts/check-boundaries.mts` enforces import boundaries.
- `infra/postgres` owns local database bootstrap files.

Module dependency direction (declared via `dependsOn`, validated acyclic): `catalog` and `customers` are leaves; `offers` depends on both; `offer-chat` depends on `offers`; `order-history` depends on `offers`; `products-sync` depends on `catalog`; `csv-import` and `knowledge-base` are headless/standalone (no deps).

## Current Product Shape

Solivio should help a sales team convert raw customer input into a reviewed offer:

1. Customer sends a request.
2. The system extracts requirements.
3. Product search and matching finds candidates.
4. A draft offer is generated.
5. A salesperson reviews, edits, validates, and accepts it.

## Database

Each schema owner has its **own Drizzle journal**: the core schema (`apps/solivio/src/server/database/schema.ts` — auth/users tables) migrates from `apps/solivio/drizzle/`, and each module's `src/data/schema.ts` migrates from its `src/data/migrations/` (tracked in its own `drizzle_migrations_<module>` table). `yarn db:migrate` applies the core journal, then every enabled module's journal, under an advisory lock — the same runner the production container executes at startup.

Schema changes:

1. Edit the owning schema file (core, or `modules/<id>/src/data/schema.ts`).
2. Run `yarn db:generate` (core) or `yarn db:generate <moduleId>` (module).
3. Review the generated SQL in the owning journal.
4. Run `yarn db:migrate` locally and `yarn db:check` to confirm no drift.

Module tables must be named `<module_id>` or `<module_id>_*` (snake_case); cross-module references are id-only columns without FK constraints.

## UI

The app uses **shadcn/ui** components with **Tailwind CSS v4**.

- Public copy should come from the README and user-facing guides.
- The shared component kit lives in `packages/ui` (`@solivio/ui`); both the app and modules import from it: `import { Button } from "@solivio/ui/components/button.tsx"`.
- Use shadcn primitives (`Button`, `Card`, `Badge`, `Textarea`, etc.) for all UI — do not write custom CSS classes. Before building any UI element, check https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components; new primitives go into `packages/ui/src/components/`.
- Style layout and spacing with Tailwind utility classes only; avoid adding rules to `globals.css`. Module sources are picked up by Tailwind via the generated `@source` list (`apps/solivio/src/generated/tailwind.css`).
- Module pages render inside the app shell automatically (protected route group); modules host or fill UI injection points via `<Slot id="..." />` from `@solivio/slots` and `src/slots.tsx`.
- Theme tokens live in `packages/theme/src/tokens.css` and are mapped in `apps/solivio/src/app/globals.css` inside `@layer base`. The theme is light-first (Solivio brand: yellow primary `#F6C215`, teal secondary `#134E4A`) with dark mode kept as an optional `.dark` / `data-theme="dark"` variant.
- `globals.css` must stay clean: Tailwind imports, the generated `@source` import, `@theme inline` token mapping, and the `@layer base` theme block only.
