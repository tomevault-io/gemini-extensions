## Project

Standboy is a VSCode/Cursor extension that auto-expands a Game Boy emulator panel while an AI coding agent is generating, and auto-collapses when it stops. The product is the shell + behavior — agent-activity detection, the auto-show/hide UX, brand chrome — wrapped around a third-party emulator (EmulatorJS).

**Read first:** `SPECS.md` (product spec), `design.html` (visual identity), `media/icon.svg` (canonical icon; rendered to `media/icon-{128,512,1024}.png`).

## Tech stack

- TypeScript (strict), VSCode Extension API ≥1.95, esbuild (extension host CJS + webview IIFE).
- React 19 + Tailwind v4 in the webview. `lucide-react` for iconography.
- EmulatorJS as npm deps (`@emulatorjs/emulatorjs` + `core-gambatte` + `core-mgba`). `scripts/vendor-emulatorjs.mjs` copies from `node_modules/@emulatorjs/*` into `vendor/emulatorjs/` before every `compile` / `build` / `watch`. `vendor/` is gitignored but ships in the `.vsix`.
- **No-Intro ROM database** (`scripts/build-rom-db.mjs`) fetches DATs from a pinned commit of `libretro/libretro-database`, parses to compact `sha1 → canonical name` JSON. Output at `data/rom-db/{gb,gbc,gba}.json` is **committed** (not gitignored, unlike `vendor/`) so builds are deterministic and offline. Refresh by bumping the SHA in the script and running `npm run rom-db`; commit the resulting JSON diff alongside the SHA bump.
- Vitest, Prettier, ESLint, GitHub Actions (build / format / test / release).

## Architecture

- Single-package flat repo. Extension host code under `src/` (Node), webview code under `webview/` (browser). Both share `src/messages.ts` as the postMessage type contract.
- Palette via four CSS custom properties (`--sb-c0..c3`). Switching palette updates the four variables — no React re-render of chrome.
- **ROM library (`src/library.ts`).** All persistent user data lives under one root, pointable at iCloud/Dropbox/etc. via `standboy.libraryDirectory`:
  - `<libraryRoot>/library.json` — index. Each entry: `name` (original filename), `canonicalName?` (No-Intro from rom-db), `ext`, `size`, `addedAt`, `lastPlayedAt`. `lastPlayedHash` at top level for auto-resume.
  - `<libraryRoot>/config.json` — user settings (key bindings today; future global prefs). Versioned envelope.
  - `<libraryRoot>/roms/<hash>.<ext>` — ROM file, content-addressed by SHA-256 first 16 hex (rename-resilient).
  - `<libraryRoot>/saves/<hash>.sav` — battery save mirror.
  - `<libraryRoot>/covers/<hash>.png` (or `.miss` marker) — fetched libretro box art.
- **Hash-based ROM identification (`src/database.ts`).** On import, the full SHA-1 of ROM bytes is matched against the bundled No-Intro DBs. Hits give us the canonical filename, used for (a) friendly display title (`friendlyName()` strips region/revision tags) and (b) the cover lookup against libretro-thumbnails. ROMs not in the DB (homebrew, hacks) fall back to the user's filename. `extension.ts` runs a one-time `backfillCanonicalNames()` on activate to retroactively identify pre-database imports.
- **Save persistence.** EmulatorJS auto-persists SRAM to the browser's IndexedDB via IDBFS (`autoPersist: true` in `vendor/emulatorjs/data/src/GameManager.js`) — that's why "Continue" works even if our disk file is empty. Our `<hash>.sav` is a portable mirror, written **event-driven, no polling** — on `visibilitychange→hidden`, `pagehide`/`beforeunload`, EmulatorHost cleanup, and force-flushed before Export Save / Import Save (via `window.__standboyFlushSave`). The extension serializes all webview→host messages through a single promise chain so a save's `writeFile` always completes before the next dependent read (auto-resume metadata, save round-trips, etc).
- **ROM byte delivery.** ROM bytes do **not** travel through `postMessage`. A 32MB GBA ROM serialised via `Array.from(uint8)` produced a ~128MB smi array plus a JSON string of similar size and would OOM the extension host on import. Instead, `loadAndPostRom` (`src/extension.ts`) `access()`-checks the ROM file at `library.romFilePath(hash, ext)`, builds a webview-resource URI via `provider.asWebviewFileUri`, and posts only the URI — `<libraryRoot>` is already in `localResourceRoots` so the webview can `fetch()` the bytes directly into a `Blob` and hand EJS a `blob:` URL. Saves stay inline (≤128KB, harmless). The webview revokes the blob URL inside `EJS_onGameStart` so the ROM-sized Blob is released as soon as EJS has copied it into its Emscripten FS.
- **Cover fetcher (`src/covers.ts`).** Tries the canonical name first, then progressively-stripped variants of the user's filename. Network calls happen in the extension host; webview only loads cached files via `asWebviewUri`. CSP stays locked-down. Concurrency 4, `coverUpdate` messages stream back to the grid as art lands.
- **Auto-show.** Sidebar `WebviewViewProvider` in primary activity bar with `retainContextWhenHidden: true`. Auto-expand on activity = `vscode.commands.executeCommand("standboy.gameView.focus")`; auto-collapse = focus `workbench.view.explorer`. Gated by the `standboy.autoShow` boolean setting (default `true`); when off, the activity dot still pulses but no focus events fire. The setting is exposed both in VSCode's Settings UI and as a one-click pill in the menu drawer's **Auto-show** section — webview reads the current value from the host's `autoShow` message (sent on `ready` and after every config change), writes via `setAutoShow` webview→host. The host does **not** optimistically echo `setAutoShow`; it lets `onAutoShowChange` deliver the persisted value, so the pill's state is always disk-derived (a failed `writeAutoShow` simply leaves the pill on its prior value rather than fooling the user into thinking the change took). Writes target whichever scope already owns the value (`cfg.inspect()` → workspace folder / workspace / global) so an in-app toggle never silently no-ops against a workspace override. State is driven by `ActivityDetector` (`src/activity.ts`), which OR's two independent signals:
  - **Override (authoritative).** A sentinel file at `~/.standboy/agent-active`, written/deleted by the user's agent via lifecycle hooks. `src/agent.ts` watches it and parses its `<kind>:<ts>` content (`kind ∈ {prompt, tool}`). Trusted when fresh; **both edges are debounced** (`showDelayMs: 5000`, `hideDelayMs: 5000`) so trivial agent turns never strobe the panel and back-to-back turns hold it open without flicker. The watcher is strictly event-driven — `fs.watch` on the parent dir handles transitions, and a single `setTimeout` (armed when the sentinel is fresh, reset on each fresh write) handles the timestamp-aging check. **No polling**, no `setInterval`. Two failure modes the watcher reconciles past the hooks:
    - **Stale-timestamp TTL.** A sentinel whose recorded timestamp is older than `STALE_THRESHOLD_MS` (5 min) is treated as absent. Catches the "Stop hook didn't fire on user interrupt" case — Claude Code's `Stop` doesn't run on interrupt, so the sentinel would otherwise stay pinned until the next activation. The one-shot stale timer (armed inside the watcher's `check()` whenever the sentinel is fresh, cleared when it's absent) fires once after the TTL with no refresh and triggers a re-check; nothing is scheduled while the sentinel is idle. The threshold doubles as the on-activate cleanup window (`cleanupStaleSentinel`); one constant for both is enough since they're the same concept (sentinel age check).
    - **Prompt-ping for re-show.** Watcher emits `onPromptPing` when a fresh `prompt`-kind write lands while it was already in the active state — i.e., a new user turn during an ongoing run. Extension wires this to the focus command (gated on `isVisible()`), so a manually-closed panel re-opens on the next prompt. `tool`-kind refreshes deliberately don't fire it — that way mid-run tool activity doesn't fight a user's deliberate close.

    Detector exposes a separate `onSchedule` callback that fires when a hide is queued (with `durationMs`) so the webview can render a countdown progress bar and the user isn't surprised by the focus shift.

  - **Burst (heuristic fallback).** Edit-burst detector — multi-character changes within a 1.5s window — for users who haven't connected an agent in the Detection menu, or for agents we don't have specific hook support for.

- **Agent-detection setup (`src/hooks.ts`).** Lives entirely in the menu drawer's **Detection** section — there is no command-palette entry (`contributes.commands` is empty). Host exposes `getAgentStatus()` (returns `{ claude: { detected, connected }, cursor: { detected, connected } }`) and `setExclusiveAgent(agent, enabled)`. **Mutually exclusive by design**: connecting one agent disconnects the other so the two never share the sentinel file at `~/.standboy/agent-active` — a stop hook from agent A can't race a start hook from agent B and prematurely hide the panel. Internal helpers `setClaudeHooks` / `setCursorHooks` are exported for tests; production code goes through `setExclusiveAgent`. The webview pulls status on `ready` (and after every toggle) via the `agentStatus` host→webview message, sends `setAgent` webview→host to flip a single agent. Detection logic: Claude Code present if `~/.claude/settings.json` or `~/.claude/projects/` exists; Cursor present if `vscode.env.appName.toLowerCase().includes("cursor")`. When neither is detected, the section renders an empty-state line; Standboy still works as a manual emulator, auto-show just stays off.
  - **Claude Code** → `~/.claude/settings.json`. Events: `UserPromptSubmit` (`marker.cjs prompt`), `PreToolUse` (`marker.cjs tool`), `Stop` (`marker.cjs stop`). Schema is `{ hooks: { <event>: [{ matcher?, hooks: [{type:"command", command}] }] } }`. We identify our entries by `command` containing the absolute marker path. **Install wipes ours-entries before re-adding** so users on the old single-`start`-command schema get migrated to the prompt/tool split on the next reinstall (driven by an activate-time idempotent re-install — see `extension.ts`).
  - **Cursor** → `~/.cursor/hooks/hooks.json`. Events: `beforeSubmitPrompt` (`marker.cjs prompt`), `afterAgentResponse` + `sessionEnd` (`marker.cjs stop`, the second is a safety-net). Schema is `{ version, hooks: { <event>: { command } | [{ command }] } }` — single object becomes an array if a user hook is already present so both fire. Install also wipes ours-entries first for the same migration reason as Claude.
  - The marker script (`~/.standboy/marker.cjs`) is **embedded as a string constant** in `src/agent.ts` and written out at activation. Doing it that way means uninstalling the extension can't leave hook commands pointing at a vanished `extensionPath/...` script. `extension.ts` calls `ensureMarkerInstalled()` at activation regardless of whether the user has connected an agent, so the FileSystemWatcher's parent dir always exists on first install.
  - Both install and uninstall are **idempotent and no-op-when-nothing-changed** (a `mutated` flag avoids spurious atomic writes).
  - **No automatic cleanup on extension uninstall.** VSCode's `vscode:uninstall` lifecycle is unreliable (microsoft/vscode#155561, #102260 — extension dir is deleted before the hook script runs; both still open as of 2026), and there is no other API that distinguishes uninstall from quit in `deactivate()`. Every comparable extension (Continue.dev, Cline, etc.) takes the same approach.
  - **First-run + onboarding.** On fresh install, `maybeRevealPanelOnFirstRun` (gated by `standboy.firstRunCompleted` in globalState) just focuses the panel — no modal. Onboarding instead lives inside the panel as two transient components rendered between the rounded header section and `LibraryGrid` (`webview/components/connect-cta.tsx`, `webview/components/cleanup-tip-toast.tsx`):
    - **`ConnectCta`** appears whenever `pickCtaAgents(status, dismissed)` returns a non-empty array — i.e. at least one agent is detected, neither is connected, and the user hasn't dismissed via the X. The card renders one Connect button per detected agent so the user picks (running in Cursor _with_ Claude Code installed is a real combo). When both are detected, Cursor comes first since `cursor.detected` only goes true when the host process literally is Cursor — they're presumably using it as their primary. Dismissal persists in `standboy.connectCtaDismissed`.
    - **`CleanupTipToast`** is a one-shot 9-second auto-dismissing footnote that surfaces the "disconnect from Detection menu before uninstalling" convention at the moment the user first connects an agent (from CTA _or_ Detection menu). Gated by `standboy.cleanupTipShown`. Mutually exclusive with the CTA in the render slot — toast preempts CTA to avoid a one-frame race after a CTA-initiated connect.
    - First successful connect also flips `connectCtaDismissed=true` so the CTA can't re-pop if the user later disconnects.
    - Upgrade-cohort backfill: on `ready`, if either agent is connected and `cleanupTipShown` is unset (i.e. the user connected via the old install-time modal that predated this flag), the tip fires once.
    - Message contract: host→webview `connectCta: { agents }` and `cleanupTip`; webview→host `dismissConnectCta`. `postAgentStatus` co-locates the `agentStatus` and `connectCta` posts so the two can't drift.

## Code conventions

- **Filenames: kebab-case.** e.g. `webview/components/standby-dot.tsx`, `scripts/vendor-emulatorjs.js`. Exceptions: conventional uppercase docs (`README.md`, `LICENSE`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `SPECS.md`) — external tooling expects those names.
- **Prefer single-word filenames in `src/`.** `agent.ts`, not `agent-detection.ts`; `hooks.ts`, not `setup-hooks.ts`; `database.ts`, not `rom-db.ts`. If a single word collides with another module (e.g. `library-root` next to `library`), pick a different single word that captures the file's role (`root.ts`). Multi-word kebab-case is fine in `webview/components/` where compound names communicate the UI element.
- **Identifiers: PascalCase** for React components and classes (`StandbyDot`, `ActivityDetector`); camelCase for functions and variables.
- **Tests co-located** with source: `src/activity.test.ts` lives next to `src/activity.ts`. Vitest picks up `src/**/*.test.ts`. Tests do not ship in the `.vsix` (`.vscodeignore` excludes `src/**`).
- Strict TypeScript. No `any`; prefer `unknown` at boundaries.
- **Comments: single-line `//` only, never `/** _/`or`/_ _/`.** Multi-line context uses consecutive `//`lines. Default is no comment — write one only when the WHY is non-obvious (hidden constraint, subtle invariant, workaround for a specific bug). Don't restate what the code already says. Drop`@param`/`@returns`JSDoc tags entirely — TypeScript types are the documentation. CSS files are the only exception (CSS only supports`/_ \*/`).
- **Never put comments before imports.** Imports come first at the top of the file (after a shebang line if present). Any file-level explanation goes _after_ the import block. The very first non-shebang line is `import` or a top-of-file declaration, never a comment.

## Hard rules

- **Never bundle ROMs.** ROMs are user-supplied via file picker. No README links to ROM sources. (The bundled No-Intro DB only stores `sha1 → canonical filename` mappings — metadata, not ROM bytes.)
- **No Cursor-specific APIs.** Same `.vsix` ships to both VSCode and Cursor.
- **Don't touch game output colors.** The palette system applies only to chrome (panel background, dot, borders, buttons, frame). The emulator renders native fidelity.
- **Avoid Ctrl+ key bindings.** VSCode reserves many globally; they won't reach the webview.
- **Never run `git commit` or `git push`.** Read/staging commands are fine; the user controls commits.

## Brand / visual

- **Icon and brand mark are fixed Kirokaze:** `#332c50` (purple), `#e2f3e4` (cream), `#94e344` (green). Source: `media/icon.svg` (1024×1024, 225px corner radius). Never recolored, never effected (no shadows, glows, gradients).
- **In-product chrome palette is user-configurable** via `standboy.palette` (kirokaze / dmg / pocket / bgb / mist) or `standboy.customPalette` (4 hex codes). The brand mark stays Kirokaze regardless of user palette.
- **Type:** system-default sans-serif stack (`-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", system-ui, sans-serif`). No pixel fonts anywhere.
- **Voice:** refer to Standboy as "he" where it sounds natural. Sentence case in all UI copy. Required disclaimer in README and marketplace listing: "Standboy is not affiliated with or endorsed by Nintendo. Game Boy is a trademark of Nintendo Co., Ltd."

## Working principles

Minimum code to solve the problem. No abstractions for single-use code. No defensive code for impossible scenarios. Surgical changes — touch only what the task requires. When uncertain, ask before assuming.
