# Knowledge Base — Agent Instructions

A personal knowledge engine that transforms passive reading into structured understanding of the AI field. Ingests sources (papers, articles, videos, podcasts), extracts claims with evidence, discovers connections, generates ideas through multi-agent debate, and maintains a living model of the current state of AI — tracking capabilities, limitations, bottlenecks, breakthroughs, and anticipations across thematic areas.

## Architecture

Local-first. PostgreSQL + pgvector + FTS as the single database. Markdown memory files (human-auditable). SQLite job queue. Telegram interface via long polling. File-based library (`library/{source_id}/`). Gateway → Adapters (Telegram, CLI, Heartbeat) → Skills Registry → Agent Executor → Storage. No cloud dependencies.

## The Three Layers

- **Knowledge graph** — what sources say. Claims, concepts, edges, evidence. Every claim links back to a verbatim snippet.
- **Landscape model** — what is true about AI right now. Themes (DAG), capabilities (with maturity), limitations (with type and trajectory), bottlenecks (with resolution horizon), breakthroughs (with implication cascades), anticipations (trackable predictions), cross-theme implications.
- **Belief system** — what you think about what is true. Tracked positions with confidence, evidence for/against, landscape links, history. The system surfaces conflicts and challenges stale positions.

## Core Principles

- **Evidence-traced.** Every claim links back to a verbatim snippet. Every edge has evidence from both sides.
- **Temporally aware.** The landscape model is a trajectory, not a snapshot. State summaries describe evolution, momentum, and stalling.
- **Human-enriched.** Automated extraction detects what's explicit and implicit. Highest-value insights come from the user via `/enrich`, `/implications`, and `/challenge`.
- **Limitations are the most valuable signal.** The system extracts implicit limitations alongside explicit ones, classifies them by type and severity, and links them to bottlenecks.

## Generated Wiki Indexes

Do not hand-edit generated wiki index rows in `wiki/index.md` or `wiki/*/index.md`. Index display rows are derived artifacts built from canonical page frontmatter/body. If an index row is wrong, fix the underlying page or metadata, then rebuild the index with `retrieval.wiki_index.rebuild_index()` or the relevant narrower rebuild helper. If an index shows mojibake, regenerate it from clean pages; do not copy terminal output back into Markdown.

## How to Invoke Skills

All skills can be invoked via the test harness:

```bash
python scripts/test_skill_harness.py <skill_name> "<slash_command>"
```

**Requirements:** PostgreSQL must be running with the knowledge base schema. Environment variables in `.env` must be configured (see `.env.example`).

**What to expect:** The harness imports the handler, constructs a job object, and executes it. Output is printed to stdout. Some skills stream progress updates. Long-running skills (save, reflect deep, synthesis) may take several minutes.

Alternatively, read the skill's prompt file at `skills/prompts/<skill_name>.md` and follow the instructions directly using your own tools to query the database.

## Special Cases

### Synthesis Prefetch

The `/synthesis` skill requires context prefetch that the test harness does **not** handle automatically. The harness will work but produce less comprehensive results.

**For full results, use direct Python invocation:**

```bash
python -c "
import sys; sys.path.insert(0, '.')
from dotenv import load_dotenv; load_dotenv()
from reading_app.db import ensure_pool; ensure_pool()
from retrieval.topic_synthesis import gather_synthesis_context, gather_merge_context
# Topic mode:
ctx = gather_synthesis_context('scaling laws')
# Merge mode:
# ctx = gather_merge_context(['01HQ3X', '01HRA2'])
print(ctx)
"
```

Then pass the context to your LLM along with the prompt at `skills/prompts/synthesis.md`.

**Or use Codex directly:** Read `skills/prompts/synthesis.md` and follow the instructions — Codex's tools can query the database and gather context natively.
