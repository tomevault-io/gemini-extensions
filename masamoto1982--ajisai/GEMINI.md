# Ajisai — Agent Writing Protocol (SKILL.md)

How to *write working Ajisai on the first try*. Every code line below was
executed by the generator against the real interpreter; results shown are
actual outputs. **If a word is not in the §9 table, it does not exist — when
unsure, grep §9 before writing.**

## 1. Run loop

```sh
ajisai run program.ajisai --json     # exit 0 = ok, 1 = language error, 2 = usage
ajisai check program.ajisai --json   # parse + resolve only, no execution
```

Read the JSON in this order (contract: docs/dev/agent-cli-output-contract.md):
1. `status` / exit code. On ok: `stackDisplay` (final stack, bottom→top) and `output` (PRINT lines).
2. On error: `diagnosis.why` + `diagnosis.where` locate the failure; follow `diagnosis.nextChecks` in order; `aiDiagnostic.recoverability` says what kind of change fixes it (`fixProgram` / `fixInput` / `fixHost` ...).
3. Even on ok, scan `errorFlowTrace` for `nilProduced` events if a NIL surprised you.

## 2. Minimal syntax

- Postfix, stack-based. Operands first, word last: `[ 1 ] [ 2 ] +`.
- Numbers are **exact rationals** (`1/3`, `3.14` → 157/50). No floats. Display shows `3/1` for 3.
- Data lives in vectors: `[ 1 2 3 ]`. Nest for tensors: `[ [ 1 2 ] [ 3 4 ] ]`. A lone number like `42` is allowed but `[ 42 ]` is the idiomatic scalar.
- Strings: `'single quotes'` (a codepoint vector with text role). Booleans: `TRUE` / `FALSE`. Absence: `NIL`.
- Code blocks: `{ ... }` — quoted programs passed to MAP / FILTER / FOLD / COND / DEF.
- User word: `{ body } 'NAME' DEF` then call `NAME`. Words are case-insensitive (canonicalized to upper case).
- Comments: `#` to end of line.
- Modifiers prefix the *next word only*: `,,` (KEEP: don't consume operands), `..` (STAK: apply to whole stack), `,` (EAT, default), `.` (TOP, default).
- One word does one thing to the stack; there are **no** DUP/SWAP-style shufflers (§8).

## 3. Control and iteration

- Branch: `value { guard } { body } { guard } { body } ... COND`. Guards see the value (it stays for each guard) and must leave TRUE/FALSE; use `{ TRUE }` as the final else-guard. The value remains on the stack after COND.
- Iterate data, not counters: `MAP` / `FILTER` / `FOLD` / `SCAN` / `UNFOLD` with `{ }` blocks (examples in §6). `FOLD` requires an explicit `[ init ]`.
- Predicates: `ANY` / `ALL` / `COUNT` with a `{ predicate }` block.
- Recursion is allowed in user words (execution-step and depth limits apply; exceeding them is a diagnosed error, not a hang).

## 4. NIL — absence is a value, not an exception

Failed partial operations *bubble*: `[ 1 ] [ 0 ] DIV` succeeds (exit 0) and
pushes `NIL` (reason: `divisionByZero`). The projection is recorded in
`errorFlowTrace` as a `nilProduced` event with a full diagnosis, and the NIL
value itself carries `semantics.absence.reason` on the stack.

- Provide a fallback with `^`: `[ 1 ] [ 0 ] DIV ^ [ 99 ]` → stack `[ 99/1 ]`.
- NIL flows through later operations (bubble rule); check for it where it matters instead of letting it propagate to the end.

## 5. UNKNOWN — the third truth value

Comparisons of lazy exact reals are *budgeted*. When the budget is exhausted
without a decision, the result is the logical `UNKNOWN`, not an error and not NIL:

```ajisai
'MATH' IMPORT
2 SQRT 8 SQRT 2 DIV 3 COMPARE-WITHIN   # √2 vs √8/2 within 3 partial quotients
```

→ stack `UNKNOWN` (exit 0). In JSON the value serializes as
`{ "type": "truthValue", "value": "unknown" }` and carries
`agreedPrefix: 3` (leading partial quotients that matched) in
`semantics.absence.diagnosis`. Raise the budget or restructure the comparison
to decide; AND/OR/NOT follow Kleene three-valued logic over UNKNOWN.

## 6. Canonical examples (all verified by the generator)

- Push a number (always inside a vector)
  `[ 42 ]` → stack: `[ 42/1 ]`
- Exact rational division — no floats, ever
  `[ 1 ] [ 3 ] /` → stack: `[ 1/3 ]`
- Elementwise vector arithmetic
  `[ 1 2 3 ] [ 4 5 6 ] +` → stack: `[ 5/1 7/1 9/1 ]`
- Scalar broadcast over a vector
  `[ 5 ] [ 1 2 3 ] *` → stack: `[ 5/1 10/1 15/1 ]`
- Remainder
  `[ 10 ] [ 3 ] %` → stack: `[ 1/1 ]`
- Comparison pushes a boolean
  `[ 1 ] [ 2 ] <` → stack: `TRUE`
- Range: one vector [ start end ] (inclusive)
  `[ 0 5 ] RANGE` → stack: `[ 0/1 1/1 2/1 3/1 4/1 5/1 ]`
- Range with step: [ start end step ]
  `[ 0 10 2 ] RANGE` → stack: `[ 0/1 2/1 4/1 6/1 8/1 10/1 ]`
- Fill a tensor: [ shape... value ]
  `[ 2 2 7 ] FILL` → stack: `[ [ 7/1 7/1 ] [ 7/1 7/1 ] ]`
- Reshape
  `[ 1 2 3 4 5 6 ] [ 2 3 ] RESHAPE` → stack: `[ [ 1/1 2/1 3/1 ] [ 4/1 5/1 6/1 ] ]`
- MAP with a { } code block
  `[ 0 4 ] RANGE { [ 2 ] * } MAP` → stack: `[ 0/1 2/1 4/1 6/1 8/1 ]`
- FILTER keeps matching elements
  `[ 0 10 ] RANGE { [ 5 ] > } FILTER` → stack: `[ 6/1 7/1 8/1 9/1 10/1 ]`
- FOLD needs an explicit initial value
  `[ 1 2 3 ] [ 0 ] { + } FOLD` → stack: `[ 6/1 ]`
- ANY / ALL / COUNT take predicate blocks
  `[ 1 2 3 ] { [ 1 ] > } ANY` → stack: `TRUE`
- Define a user word: { body } then name, then DEF
  `{ [ 1 ] [ 2 ] + } 'MY-SUM' DEF MY-SUM` → stack: `[ 3/1 ]`
- COND: value on stack, then { guard } { body } pairs (use { TRUE } as else-guard)
  `[ 4 ] { [ 0 ] >= } { 'non-negative' PRINT } { TRUE } { 'negative' PRINT } COND` → prints `'non-negative'`; stack: `[ 4/1 ]`
- Strings are bare '...' literals; CHARS/JOIN convert
  `'hello' CHARS REVERSE JOIN` → stack: `'olleh'`
- Cast a string to an exact number
  `'42' NUM` → stack: `42/1`
- PRINT pops and emits to output (not the stack)
  `[ 1 2 3 ] PRINT` → prints `[ 1/1 2/1 3/1 ]`
- Module words need IMPORT first
  `'ALGO' IMPORT [ 3 1 2 ] SORT` → stack: `[ 1/1 2/1 3/1 ]`
- KEEP modifier `,,` makes the next word non-consuming
  `[ 5 ] ,, PRINT` → prints `[ 5/1 ]`; stack: `[ 5/1 ]`

## 7. Common errors — actual CLI output, and the fix

- **Typo / unknown word** — `[ 1 ] ADDD`
  → exit 1, `message: "Unknown word: ADDD"`, `diagnosis: { when: "resolveWord", why: "typoOrUnknownName" }`,
  `aiDiagnostic.recoverability: "fixProgram"`, first nextCheck: "Check spelling".
  Fix: Grep §9 for the word you meant (here: `+` / `ADD`). Word names are upper-cased automatically.
- **Stack underflow: operands must be pushed first** — `+`
  → exit 1, `message: "Stack underflow"`, `diagnosis: { when: "executeWord", why: "stackShape" }`,
  `aiDiagnostic.recoverability: "fixProgram"`, first nextCheck: "Check arity".
  Fix: Push both operands before the operator: `[ 1 ] [ 2 ] +`. Ajisai is postfix; there is no infix form.
- **FOLD without an initial value** — `[ 1 2 3 ] { + } FOLD`
  → exit 1, `message: "Stack underflow"`, `diagnosis: { when: "executeWord", why: "stackShape" }`,
  `aiDiagnostic.recoverability: "fixProgram"`, first nextCheck: "Check arity".
  Fix: FOLD is `vector [ init ] { op } FOLD`: `[ 1 2 3 ] [ 0 ] { + } FOLD`.
- **COND blocks must come in { guard } { body } pairs** — `[ 5 ] { [ 3 ] > } { 'big' PRINT } { 'small' PRINT } COND`
  → exit 1, `message: "COND: expected even number of code blocks (guard/body pairs), got 3"`, `diagnosis: { when: "executeWord", why: "unknown" }`,
  `aiDiagnostic.recoverability: "inspectContext"`, first nextCheck: "Check error message".
  Fix: Give every body a guard; the else-branch is `{ TRUE } { ... }`: `[ 5 ] { [ 3 ] > } { 'big' PRINT } { TRUE } { 'small' PRINT } COND`.
- **COND guards must yield a boolean** — `TRUE { [ 1 ] } { [ 2 ] } COND`
  → exit 1, `message: "COND: guard must return TRUE or FALSE, got non-scalar"`, `diagnosis: { when: "executeWord", why: "unknown" }`,
  `aiDiagnostic.recoverability: "inspectContext"`, first nextCheck: "Check error message".
  Fix: The first block is a guard, not a value: it must leave TRUE/FALSE. Branch on a stack value with `[ x ] { predicate } { body } ... COND`.
- **Broadcast shape mismatch** — `[ 1 2 ] [ 1 2 3 ] +`
  → exit 1, `message: "Cannot broadcast shapes [2] and [3]"`, `diagnosis: { when: "executeWord", why: "unknown" }`,
  `aiDiagnostic.recoverability: "inspectContext"`, first nextCheck: "Check error message".
  Fix: Elementwise ops need equal or broadcastable shapes (scalar `[ 5 ]` broadcasts; `[2]` vs `[3]` does not).
- **NUM casts strings, not booleans** — `TRUE NUM`
  → exit 1, `message: "NUM: expected String, got Boolean"`, `diagnosis: { when: "executeWord", why: "unknown" }`,
  `aiDiagnostic.recoverability: "inspectContext"`, first nextCheck: "Check error message".
  Fix: NUM accepts strings: `'42' NUM`. There is no boolean→number cast.
- **Old two-vector RANGE form** — `[ 0 ] [ 5 ] RANGE`
  → exit 1, `message: "RANGE requires [start end] or [start end step]"`, `diagnosis: { when: "executeWord", why: "unknown" }`,
  `aiDiagnostic.recoverability: "inspectContext"`, first nextCheck: "Check error message".
  Fix: RANGE takes one vector: `[ 0 5 ] RANGE` (or `[ start end step ]`).
- **Vector-wrapped string passed to a cast** — `[ '42' ] NUM`
  → exit 1, `message: "NUM: expected String input"`, `diagnosis: { when: "executeWord", why: "unknown" }`,
  `aiDiagnostic.recoverability: "inspectContext"`, first nextCheck: "Check error message".
  Fix: String casts take the bare string: `'42' NUM`.

## 8. Forbidden patterns (each verified to fail)

- **DUP / SWAP / DROP / OVER / ROT** (`DUP` fails) — Forth-style stack shufflers do not exist. Use the modifiers instead: `,,` (KEEP: next word does not consume), `..` (STAK: next word applies to the whole stack).
- **IF / ELSE / THEN / WHILE** (`[ 1 ] IF` fails) — No structured keywords. Branch with COND guard/body pairs; iterate with MAP / FILTER / FOLD / UNFOLD or recursive user words.
- **Parentheses ( )** (`( 1 2 )` fails) — Reserved for the continued-fraction *display* form only. Vectors are `[ ]`, code blocks are `{ }`.
- **Double-quoted strings** (`"hello" PRINT` fails) — Strings use single quotes: 'hello'.
- **// line comments** (`// comment` fails) — Comments start with `#`.

## 9. Word quick reference
