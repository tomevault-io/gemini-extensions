# cc-connect — agent guide

A peer-to-peer chat substrate that lets multiple Claude Code instances share the same context. See @README.md for the user story and demo flow; this file is for Claude.

## What this repo is (mental model)

- **Rust workspace** with five crates (`cc-connect`, `cc-connect-core`, `cc-connect-hook`, `cc-connect-mcp`, `cc-connect-tui`) plus a **Bun + React + Ink** chat panel under `chat-ui/`. Both build into `target/release/`.
- The substrate is **chat-as-context**: every Peer's Claude reads from a locally-replicated `~/.cc-connect/rooms/<topic>/log.jsonl`. The `UserPromptSubmit` hook (`cc-connect-hook`) injects unread messages into the next prompt. That's the magic.
- The MCP server (`cc-connect-mcp`) lets Claude write back into the room — `cc_send`, `cc_at`, `cc_drop`, etc.

## Read these before deep work

The canonical specs live in repo root, not in this file. Do not duplicate them here.

- @CONTEXT.md — Ubiquitous Language. **Use these terms verbatim** (Room, Ticket, Substrate, Peer, Host, Identity, Pubkey, Message, Hook, Cursor, Backfill, Session, Injection, Context). Never drift to "channel", "session", "client", "history", "memory" except when the term genuinely applies.
- [PROTOCOL.md](PROTOCOL.md) — wire spec, RFC 2119 keywords. Read on demand for anything touching gossip payloads, Tickets, Backfill RPC, file_drop, or on-disk layout. **Wire-format changes are breaking** — bump `v` and the ALPN.
- [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) — threat model. Read on demand before changing anything in `cc_drop` blocklists, hook injection paths, identity handling, or relay routing.
- [TODOS.md](TODOS.md) — known gaps and the v0.1 → v1.0 migration list. Read on demand when picking up unfinished work.
- `docs/adr/` — decisions already made. Don't re-litigate; if you must reopen, mark the contradiction explicitly.

## Commands you can't infer from the code

```bash
# Workspace build (Rust + chat-ui together — install.sh wraps this)
./install.sh                               # interactive, idempotent; sets up hook + MCP
cargo build --workspace --release          # Rust only
(cd chat-ui && bun install && bun run build)   # chat-ui → target/release/cc-chat-ui

# Tests
cargo test --workspace                     # Rust unit + integration
scripts/smoke-test.sh                      # end-to-end: spin two peers, check gossip
scripts/smoke-test-mcp.sh                  # MCP server tools
scripts/smoke-test-bg.sh                   # background host-daemon path
(cd chat-ui && bun test && bunx tsc --noEmit)

# Diagnostics
./target/release/cc-connect doctor         # verify install (hook entry, identity, perms)
```

`Cargo.lock` **is tracked on purpose** — this repo ships binaries and reproducible builds gate the v0.1 release. Do not gitignore it.

## Non-obvious gotchas

- **Vendored ed25519 / ed25519-dalek**. `Cargo.toml`'s `[patch.crates-io]` points at `vendored/ed25519` + `vendored/ed25519-dalek`. The published `ed25519-3.0.0-rc.4` is broken against current `pkcs8` (`Error::KeyMalformed` enum-variant break). Drop the patch only when upstream ships a working `ed25519-dalek`. See [TODOS.md](TODOS.md).
- **MSRV is 1.89** (`workspace.package.rust-version`). Driven by the iroh stack itself (`iroh@0.97`, `iroh-blobs@0.99`, `iroh-gossip@0.97`, `iroh-relay@0.97` all require 1.89). CI gates on this; install.sh actively `rustup update`s when the user has an older toolchain.
- **Hook trust boundary**. `cc-connect-hook` injects chat context only when `CC_CONNECT_ROOM` is set in its env (set by `cc-connect-tui` when it spawns the Claude PTY). Unrelated `claude` invocations on the same machine see nothing. Don't loosen this — it's the cross-process isolation guarantee in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
- **PID-based active-rooms discovery** lives at `/tmp/cc-connect-$UID/active-rooms/<topic>.active`, not under `~`. PIDs are per-machine; cloud-synced homes would collide. See `docs/adr/0003-pid-based-active-rooms-discovery.md`.
- **8 KB hook stdout budget.** `cc-connect-hook` keeps each `UserPromptSubmit` payload ≤ 8 KB so it stays inline; over that, Claude Code falls back to a 2 KB preview + persisted file. See `docs/adr/0004-hook-budget-and-graceful-overflow.md`.
- **`cc_drop` path blocklist** rejects `~/.ssh`, `~/.aws`, `.env*`, `id_rsa*`, `*.pem`, etc. Don't widen it without a SECURITY.md update; don't narrow it without an explicit threat-model justification.
- **iroh dependency pin** — `iroh 0.97`, `iroh-gossip 0.97`, `iroh-blobs 0.99`. The combo is non-trivial; bumping any one usually requires bumping all three together.

## Workflow

- **Plan before coding for protocol or hook work.** Anything touching wire format, identity, hook injection, or `cc_drop` semantics gets a Plan-mode pass first — these break compatibility silently if you guess.
- **Treat ADRs as first-class.** When a decision is hard-to-reverse, surprising-without-context, and the result of a real trade-off, write one in `docs/adr/NNNN-kebab-name.md` (see `.claude/skills/grill-with-docs/ADR-FORMAT.md`). Don't write ADRs for ephemeral decisions.
- **Domain-first naming.** New module names should reflect terms in @CONTEXT.md. If you need a new domain term, update CONTEXT.md in the same change. The `improve-codebase-architecture` and `grill-with-docs` skills enforce this — invoke them when in doubt.
- **Tests over assertions.** Real bugs in this codebase have come from gossip ordering and hook concurrency, not from pure-function edge cases. Prefer integration smoke tests under `scripts/` over fine-grained mocks.

## Release checklist (read before tagging or merging release-shaped PRs)

### Tag namespaces (pick the right one)

- `v0.X.Y` / `v0.X.Y-rc.1` → ships **Rust binaries** via
  `.github/workflows/release.yml` (cc-connect, cc-connect-hook,
  cc-chat-ui tarballs).
- `vscode-extension-v0.X.Y` / `…-rc.1` → ships the **VSCode
  extension .vsix** via
  `.github/workflows/vscode-extension-release.yml`. The workflow
  refuses to package if the tag's version doesn't match
  `vscode-extension/package.json::version`, so bump that file in the
  same commit you tag from.

The two pipelines are independent; tagging one does not trigger the
other. The extension declares its required minimum cc-connect binary
version in its `package.json` so users get a clear error when they
mix incompatible versions.

### Install / uninstall surface contract

Every release MUST keep `cc-connect uninstall` able to reverse the new
install. The uninstall + upgrade flows promise users they can wipe a
machine clean and start fresh; if a release adds new on-disk state but
not the matching cleanup, every user upgrading after will accumulate
dead files / settings forever.

The cleanup surface lives in `crates/cc-connect/src/lifecycle.rs`:

- **`INSTALLED_BIN_NAMES`** — every binary `install.sh` symlinks into
  `~/.local/bin`. New binary in the workspace? Add it here (and to
  `install.sh`'s symlink loop).
- **`MCP_SERVER_KEY`** — the key used in `~/.claude.json::mcpServers`
  and by `claude mcp add`. Keep `setup.rs` and `lifecycle.rs` in sync.
- **`run_clear`** — stops every long-running daemon. New daemon
  variant? Add a `list_running` + `run_stop` and call them here.
- **`remove_hook_from_settings` / `remove_mcp_from_claude_json`** —
  the JSON-mutation paths. New `~/.claude/settings.json` key written
  during install (e.g. a new hook event)? Strip it here too.
- **`run_uninstall` --purge** — wipes `~/.cc-connect/`. New persistent
  file written outside that tree? Either move it inside, or add an
  explicit removal step here.

Every release-shaped PR (anything touching `install.sh`, `setup.rs`,
or any new persistent file location) MUST include a corresponding
update to `lifecycle.rs` and a test exercising the cleanup. Reviewers:
look for a paired commit; reject if missing.

## Repository etiquette

- **Commit messages**: `type(scope): subject`. Types: `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`. Scopes are real components — `core`, `hook`, `mcp`, `tui`, `chat-ui`, `chat-daemon`, `install`, `room`, `security`, etc. Examples in `git log --oneline`.
- **Branch model**: trunk-based on `main`. Feature work goes through PRs; ship small.
- **PR title** mirrors the eventual commit subject. PR body has `## Summary` and `## Test plan` sections (see `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`).
- **License**: MIT OR Apache-2.0 (workspace-level). Every new crate inherits it via `license.workspace = true`.

## Agent skills

This repo's `.claude/skills/` includes the cc-connect-specific skills (`cc-connect-setup`, `cc-connect-chat`, `cc-connect-relay-setup`) plus the engineering skills from `mattpocock/skills`. Per-repo configuration the skills look for:

- **Issue tracker** — GitHub Issues at `Minara-AI/cc-connect` (use the `gh` CLI). See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.
- **Triage labels** — defaults: `needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, `wontfix`. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.
- **Domain docs** — single context. Glossary at @CONTEXT.md, ADRs under `docs/adr/`, wire spec at [PROTOCOL.md](PROTOCOL.md). See `docs/agents/domain-docs.md`.

## What NOT to do

- Don't introduce a JS/TS dep in the Rust crates or vice versa. The two halves talk through `~/.cc-connect/rooms/<topic>/chat.sock` (IPC) and `log.jsonl` (file tail) — keep that contract.
- Don't add a build step that requires a network reach during `cargo build`. The vendored ed25519 patch and pinned iroh versions assume an offline-friendly build after first fetch.
- Don't `unwrap()` in code paths the hook calls. Hook failures degrade to a no-op (Claude Code's `<persisted-output>` safety net), but a panic costs the whole prompt.
- Don't store room state in a place that crosses machines (cloud-synced `~`). PID files belong in `/tmp/cc-connect-$UID/`; identity stays at `~/.cc-connect/identity.key` mode `0600`.
