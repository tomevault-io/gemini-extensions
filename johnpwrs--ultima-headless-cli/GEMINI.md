# ClassicUO Headless Client — Agent Guide

A headless Ultima Online client that speaks the full UO network protocol with no window, no rendering, and no audio. Designed to be controlled by an agent (human or AI) through a CLI or daemon interface.

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Configure credentials

Edit `headless/.env`:

```env
UO_HOST=login.uorenaissance.com
UO_PORT=2593
UO_USER=youraccount
UO_PASS=yourpassword
UO_VERSION=5.0.8.3
UO_SERVER=0        # auto-select server index (comment out to pick manually)
UO_CHAR=0          # auto-select character index (comment out to pick manually)
```

### 2. Build

```bash
cd headless
dotnet build
```

### 3. Run — Interactive mode

```bash
dotnet run
```

You get a `cuo>` prompt. The client auto-connects and logs in using `.env`. Type `help` for all commands.

### 4. Run — Daemon mode (recommended for agents)

```bash
dotnet run -- --daemon &
```

- Commands go to: `echo "command" >> /tmp/cuocmd`
- All output goes to: `tail -f /tmp/cuolog`
- The session stays alive. Send commands at any time without restarting.

```bash
# Send a command
echo "status" >> /tmp/cuocmd

# Watch output live
tail -f /tmp/cuolog

# Read last N lines
tail -20 /tmp/cuolog
```

path 1500 1700              # get directions to walk there

## Daemon mode workflow (agent usage)

```bash
# Start daemon (stays alive, logs everything)
cd headless
dotnet run -- --daemon &

# Wait for login (~15s), then interact
sleep 16

# Load map data for pathfinding and LOS
echo "loadmap" >> /tmp/cuocmd
sleep 10

# Check state
echo "status" >> /tmp/cuocmd && sleep 0.5 && tail -5 /tmp/cuolog
echo "skills" >> /tmp/cuocmd && sleep 0.5 && tail -20 /tmp/cuolog

# Check line of sight before attacking
echo "los" >> /tmp/cuocmd && sleep 0.5 && tail -20 /tmp/cuolog

# Attack nearest grey/red target with clear LOS
echo "an" >> /tmp/cuocmd && sleep 0.5 && tail -3 /tmp/cuolog

# Walk toward mobs
echo "walk n" >> /tmp/cuocmd && sleep 0.5

# Check for skill gains (printed automatically when they happen)
grep "SKILL" /tmp/cuolog | tail -10
```

---

## Game state in real time

The daemon logs key events automatically:

```
[INFO ] [SKILL] Archery: 2.1 ↑        ← skill gain
[INFO ] War mode: True                  ← war mode change

System: Welcome to UO Renaissance...   ← server messages
passenger: Hello!                       ← speech heard in range
*** Entered the world! ***              ← character entered world
```

Monitor with:
```bash
tail -f /tmp/cuolog                     # live stream
grep "SKILL" /tmp/cuolog               # all skill gains
grep "System:" /tmp/cuolog             # server messages
grep "Archery" /tmp/cuolog             # archery-specific events
```

## Serials

All UO entities have a unique 32-bit serial number shown as hex:

```
< 0x40000000  →  mobile (player or NPC)
≥ 0x40000000  →  item
```

Serials appear in `mobiles` and `items` output as `[XXXXXXXX]`. Use them with `attack`, `click`, `use`, `wear`, `unequip`.

```bash
# Example: attack the first mobile in the list
echo "mobiles" >> /tmp/cuocmd
sleep 1
# See: [00012F0D] Dog  →  then:
echo "attack 12F0D" >> /tmp/cuocmd
```

---

## Notes for agents

- **Always check LOS before attacking** with ranged weapons (`los` command or `an` which checks automatically)
- **Skill lock status** shown in `skills` output: `↑up` = gaining, `■locked` = cannot gain
- **Crossbow swing timer** is ~6 seconds — don't send attacks faster than that
- **Encryption** is off for UO Renaissance (`useEncryption = false` in HeadlessClient.cs)
- **Map data** must be loaded with `loadmap` for pathfinding and LOS to work
- **Daemon PID**: kill with `pkill -f cuoheadless`
