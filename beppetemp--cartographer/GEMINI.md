# AGENTS.md — Cartographer

Go MCP server for the *Agentic Wiki* (Karpathy pattern + OKF). The agent never touches files directly: it operates via MCP tools; the server enforces the invariants. → `docs/overview.md`

**Where to look for what** (not duplicated here):

| Need | Source of truth |
|---|---|
| Full doc map + reading paths | `docs/index.md` (read that first, then only the relevant pages) |
| Project status and milestones | `docs/roadmap.md` |
| Why behind a choice (AD/D entries) | `docs/decisions.md` — Grep for the entry (`## D<n>`), never read in full |
| List of MCP tools | `docs/control-plane.md` §API MCP |
| `CARTOGRAPHER_*` env vars, YAML config, deploy | `docs/deployment.md` |
| Client subcommands / TUI | `docs/configurator.md` |
| Test strategy and pre-release checklist | `docs/testing.md` |
| Go conventions | `docs/conventions.md` |

## Commands

```
make build           # → bin/cartographer
make test            # go test ./...
make vet             # go vet ./...
make fmt             # gofmt -w .
make run             # stdio with demo KB
make run-http        # HTTP on :8080 with demo KB
make smoke           # build + quick stdio test
make smoke-http      # operator-level HTTP smoke test (creates temp KBs via curl)
make docker          # build Docker image
make clean           # removes bin/ and demo-kb/
```

```bash
./bin/cartographer serve --kb /path/to/kb --init      # local stdio server
./bin/cartographer serve --config config.yaml         # HTTP/stdio server (YAML, see config.example.yaml)
./bin/cartographer connect|disconnect|status|sync     # multi-provider client (HTTP)
./bin/cartographer                                    # TUI dashboard (if TTY), otherwise usage
```

Protocol: JSON-RPC 2.0. Stdio = newline-delimited. HTTP = POST /mcp. Logs on stderr.

## Code navigation

graphify graph in `graphify-out/` (not versioned). Structural questions about the code (where does X live, who calls Y, what does Z depend on) are answered by querying **the graph first** — `graphify query "<question>" --budget <n>`, `graphify path "<A>" "<B>"`, `graphify explain "<node>"` — then reading only the indicated `file:line` locations. No broad Grep/Explore if the graph can answer (for an exact, already-known symbol a targeted grep is equivalent); the `/graphify` skill is only for building/updating the graph, never for queries. Specific rules:

- the graph gives the **where/how it connects**; the **why** lives in `docs/decisions.md` (Grep the entry), current status in `docs/` (map in `docs/index.md`);
- in mandates to `dev`/OpenCode include the `file:line` pointers already derived from the graph: the subagent should not re-explore from scratch;
- the graph realigns itself via the post-commit hook (`graphify hook status`); it reflects the last build: for just-modified files, trust the disk.

## Adding an MCP tool

1. `func toolName(k *kb.KB) Tool` in the relevant `internal/mcpserver/tools_<domain>.go` file.
2. Handler: deserialize args → call `kb`/`okf` → `textResult`/`errorResult`.
3. Register in `RegisterKBTools` (`tools.go`).
4. Test in `internal/mcpserver/server_test.go`.
5. `make vet && make test` green.
6. Update `docs/control-plane.md` §API MCP and `docs/decisions.md` if it's a non-obvious choice.

## Workflow and documentation

- All changes land via PR: `main` is protected (required `test` check, squash-merge only, no direct pushes). Branch `feat/<slug>` → `gh pr create` → merge on green CI. PR titles are conventional commits (linted in CI): release-please computes the semver bump from them.
- Isolable code may be delegated to a coding subagent (maintainer setup: `dev` agent, or OpenCode for mechanical work); the coordinator verifies `make vet && make test`.
- Analysis/design and implementation often happen in separate sessions: the handoff is a **plan issue** — a self-contained GitHub issue from the `Plan` template, label `plan` (procedure and self-sufficiency test in `CONTRIBUTING.md` §Plan issues). The implementing session reads it with `gh issue view <n>` and the implementation PR closes it (`Closes #<n>`).
- Server and client releases (release-please PR merge, pipeline, rollout, local client update) → maintainer-local tooling, not versioned here.
- **Documentation is updated in the same session in which the code is changed — never afterward.** The "what changes → which file to update" table is in `docs/index.md` §Maintenance rules: use it for every change.
- Conventions → `docs/conventions.md`. Every non-obvious choice → a D entry in `docs/decisions.md`.
- Milestone completed → `docs/roadmap.md`.
- **This file is stable imprinting**: no mutable state, versions, counts or changelog here — those live in `docs/roadmap.md` and `docs/decisions.md`. The docs describe the **current state**, not history: "how we got here" lives only in `decisions.md` and the git log.
