# App Store Connect — Full Management Skill

Complete App Store Connect management via REST API and xcodebuild CLI.

## Credentials

Load credentials from `config/credentials.local.md` (gitignored). That file contains:
- Key ID, Issuer ID, Private Key path, Team ID
- Default contact info (company, email, phone, copyright)

## Authentication (Required for All API Calls)

```python
import jwt, time, requests

# Load these values from config/credentials.local.md
KEY_ID = "YOUR_KEY_ID"           # See config/credentials.local.md
ISSUER_ID = "YOUR_ISSUER_ID"    # See config/credentials.local.md
KEY_PATH = "/path/to/AuthKey.p8" # See config/credentials.local.md

with open(KEY_PATH, 'r') as f:
    private_key = f.read()

payload = {"iss": ISSUER_ID, "iat": int(time.time()), "exp": int(time.time()) + 1200, "aud": "appstoreconnect-v1"}
token = jwt.encode(payload, private_key, algorithm="ES256", headers={"kid": KEY_ID})
headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {token}", "Content-Type": "application/json"}
```

## Core ID Resolution (Always Do First)

Most operations require these IDs. Resolve them before any update:

```python
# 1. Get APP_ID
response = requests.get("https://api.appstoreconnect.apple.com/v1/apps", headers=headers)
for app in response.json()['data']:
    print(f"{app['attributes']['name']} - {app['attributes']['bundleId']} (ID: {app['id']})")
APP_ID = "the-app-id"

# 2. Get VERSION_ID
response = requests.get(f"https://api.appstoreconnect.apple.com/v1/apps/{APP_ID}/appStoreVersions", headers=headers)
VERSION_ID = response.json()['data'][0]['id']

# 3. Get LOCALIZATION_ID (for version-level metadata)
response = requests.get(f"https://api.appstoreconnect.apple.com/v1/appStoreVersions/{VERSION_ID}/appStoreVersionLocalizations", headers=headers)
LOCALIZATION_ID = response.json()['data'][0]['id']

# 4. Get APP_INFO_ID and APP_INFO_LOC_ID (for app-level metadata)
response = requests.get(f"https://api.appstoreconnect.apple.com/v1/apps/{APP_ID}/appInfos", headers=headers)
APP_INFO_ID = response.json()['data'][0]['id']
response = requests.get(f"https://api.appstoreconnect.apple.com/v1/appInfos/{APP_INFO_ID}/appInfoLocalizations", headers=headers)
APP_INFO_LOC_ID = response.json()['data'][0]['id']
```

## API Permissions

- GET apps, versions, localizations, reviews, builds, reports
- UPDATE metadata, screenshots, categories, reviews, TestFlight, releases
- CREATE versions, localizations, screenshots, IAPs, subscriptions, events

## Hard Limitations (Cannot Be Done via API)

These operations are **confirmed impossible** via the App Store Connect REST API as of April 2026.
Do NOT attempt these programmatically — they will fail or have no endpoint.

| Operation | Why Not | What to Do Instead |
|-----------|---------|-------------------|
| **Create a new app** | No `POST /v1/apps` endpoint exists. API keys get `403 FORBIDDEN`. Fastlane `produce` also cannot do this with API keys. | Create manually at https://appstoreconnect.apple.com -> Apps -> + -> New App |
| **Configure App Privacy** | No API endpoints exist for the privacy questionnaire (data collection types, tracking declarations). Apple provides only a web-based wizard. | Configure manually: ASC -> Apps -> [App] -> App Privacy -> Get Started |
| **Upload or change app icon** | Icons are embedded in the Xcode asset catalog and bundled into the binary. There is no separate icon upload endpoint. Changing an icon requires a new build. | Set icon in Xcode: Assets.xcassets -> AppIcon, then archive and upload a new build |
| **Retrieve app icon image** | Limited: `iconAssetToken` on build resources may return icon URLs, but there is no dedicated icon download endpoint. Results vary. | Best approach: extract from the Xcode project asset catalog, or use the App Store marketing artwork URL |
| **Delete an app** | Apps cannot be deleted via API. They can be removed from sale or fully removed (if never published). | Remove manually: ASC -> Apps -> [App] -> Remove App (see [Apple docs](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/create-an-app-record/remove-an-app/)) |
| **Transfer an app** | App transfers are a multi-step manual process between two developer accounts. No API support. | Initiate manually: ASC -> Apps -> [App] -> Transfer App |
| **Manage agreements/contracts** | Paid/free app agreements, tax forms, and banking details have no API. | Manage at https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/agreements/ |
| **Configure Privacy Manifests** | PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy files are part of the Xcode project, not ASC metadata. | Add PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy to Xcode project before building |

**Note on age rating:** Despite being listed as "manual" in some guides, age ratings CAN be configured via API using `PATCH /v1/ageRatingDeclarations/{id}`. This skill covers it in `references/metadata-and-localization.md`.

## Common Errors

| Error | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| `whatsNew cannot be edited` | Remove whatsNew for new apps (only available for updates) |
| `403 FORBIDDEN on CREATE apps` | This is a hard API limitation, not a permissions issue. Create app manually in ASC portal |
| `Invalid bundle ID` | Ensure bundle ID is registered in Developer portal first |
| `JWT expired` | Tokens last 20 minutes max; regenerate before each session |
| `ENTITY_ERROR.RELATIONSHIP` | Check that relationship IDs exist and are correct type |
| `Pending Agreements` | Accept latest agreements at https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/agreements/ |
