## Project

**ALYNXDJ** — an LSDJ-inspired music tracker for the **Atari Lynx**, the third
tracker in the author's family after **SMSGGDJ** (Master System / Game Gear,
`/Users/a1106632/Documents/sms_tracker`) and **GENMDDJ** (Mega Drive,
`/Users/a1106632/Documents/genmddj`). The brief is `task.txt`: port as much of the
design, control scheme, command set, and GUI feel of SMSGGDJ/GENMDDJ as makes sense,
while exploiting everything unique to the Lynx sound hardware (Mikey's 4 channels of
LFSR/polynomial-counter synthesis, per-channel 8-bit DAC access, stereo panning on
later hardware). The ROM and project name is **ALYNXDJ**.

**DESIGN.md is the contract** (with a §0 decision log — read it before design
decisions, don't re-litigate settled ones); **PLAN.md** holds the milestone
history through M48. Key settled decisions: 4 identical
tracks each playing LFSR/WAV/KIT (D1/D35), cc65 C editor + ca65 asm
driver/IRQ/render (D2), 59.9 Hz VBlank engine tick with no region split (D3),
flat RAM song block but **packed/RLE EEPROM save — 2 KB 93C86 is the whole
persistence budget** (D4/D10), per-channel timer-IRQ PCM capped at 2 voices
(D5/D6), 4×6 font on a 40×17 grid (D7). KIT and table-WAV dynamically
target the owning channel A–D; there are no fixed sample buses. LFSR patches
(including legacy stored type `$01`) persist TSP/SWP/VIB/TRM plus TBS in
save-format v6 (D15–D17/D35); WAV retains signed TSP, while KIT reuses byte
15 as D48's source RATE (`FF` 0.5×, `00`–`03` 1×–4×). VIB is a
centred ~0.47–7.49 Hz sine whose phase free-runs across notes and resets at
the transport boundary. TBS 0 is a per-note table cycle and TBS 1–F are
tick-clocked; every mode wraps `0F→00`, while `H` sets a custom loop. KIT VOL
is D36's static foreground PCM gain:
high nibble `6`–`7` full, `2`–`5` signed `>>1`, `1` signed `>>2`, and `0`
mute; its low nibble is ignored and blocked in the UI, while the DAC IRQ
remains unchanged. D19/D20 add receive-only ComLynx MIDI takeover and
clock sync: full-status MIDI channels 1–4 route to tracks A–D/instruments
00–03. The UART IRQ buffers bytes continuously and the 59.9 Hz engine tick
drains complete messages before voice processing, so redraw cannot delay MIDI
and serial receive stays live while a multi-channel chord is applied. The Pico
emits an immediate `IN24` row grant after Start/Continue, then divides USB
or serial MIDI's 24 PPQN into one pulse per following tracker row. `IN` and `IN24` arm
locally at the cued row as `WAIT`; their first row pulse starts that row and
changes the transport to `PLAY`. MIDI CC74 enters the shared `N` executor path
as a note-local LFSR taps byte; Pitch Bend enters shared `F` as a held absolute
±2-semitone target at 1/16-semitone resolution. There is no heartbeat.
For legacy Lynx-to-Lynx OUT/IN, D55 makes the single `$02` START byte the
downbeat/first-row grant; later rows use `$01`. Do not send START+ROW adjacent:
legacy IN is polled and Mikey has only a one-byte receive holding register.
The companion bridge also accepts opto-isolated 31,250-baud serial MIDI on
GP13, expands running status, and routes it through the same dispatcher as USB
MIDI. Use one MIDI source at a time. The Chipbridge RP2040-Zero build follows
the PCB exactly: ComLynx `DATA1` = GP1, MIDI RX = GP13, and ready LED = GP7;
`DATA0`/GP0 is unused. Its Lynx cable is ring-to-ring plus sleeve-to-sleeve
only, with both tips disconnected and insulated because the Lynx tip is +5 V.
The separate D56 `pico-gg-sync` image keeps that hardware fixed: SMSGGDJ OUT
enters the Type-A MIDI optocoupler on GP13, whose differential ring/bit1 and
tip/bit0 input exposes only counter state 2. It measures the one-low/three-high
marker, reconstructs an equal row grid, and emits legacy START/ROW/STOP on GP1.
Flat GG rows are exact; arbitrary swing cannot survive the one-bit collapse.
The complete unchanged path is hardware-verified as of 2026-08-27. This repo
owns the translator firmware and tests; the cross-linked Chipbridge repo owns
the PCB, GG adapter, and shared connector hardware.
KIT bank follows D38: it is always `00`–`07`, selecting KIT or viewing an old
invalid KIT value normalizes it to `00`, and only WAV may display `--`.
KIT sample banks follow D39: the one supported `PL` format uses rate ID `1`,
5,208.333 Hz signed 8-bit PCM (timer reload 191), with up to ~12.58 seconds
per u16-sized slot. The builder handles 8/16/24/32-bit integer WAV sources;
older experimental rate IDs are intentionally rejected. D40 factory
conversion peak-normalizes, then applies +12.00 dB into a tanh soft limiter
before signed 8-bit quantization; the processing is baked into the bank.
KIT RATE repeats or skips ring bytes while keeping reload 191, so 2×–4× do
not raise IRQ frequency. `Sxx` is D47's bounded KIT source-rate override:
its low two bits select 1×/2×/4×/0.5× without changing the timer, and every
note/`R` restores the instrument stride. KIT pad selection ignores instrument
TSP/RATE but still follows phrase/chain note transpose.
Command values retain their historical/save-format IDs. PHRASE steps through
all implemented letters alphabetically; TABLE exposes only
`B C E F G H K N O P R S T V W X` and rejects `A D I J L Z` in both
directions and command recall (D21). Editing a PHRASE/TABLE command pair
updates one global recall latch, and tapping physical B on an empty
command-letter cell inserts both remembered bytes without overwriting
occupied data. Repeated phrase `Axx` targets preserve a TBS 0 playhead;
changed targets restart. DCY 0 is immediate and HOLD F is the sole indefinite
patch sustain (D45). `E` restarts attack at its new live rates, `N` is
note-local without overwriting G/B tap state, `P` follows SWP's sign
direction, and `R` continues clocking after natural envelope end (D50).
`Jxy` follows the sibling mask-first order: x is the
four-pass mask and y is signed transpose (D41). PAN is universal across
LFSR/WAV/KIT: byte `xy` gives left/right output level, and existing command
`Oxy` applies the same encoding live until the next note restores patch PAN
(D42). Zero PAN nibbles also set MSTEREO's per-side hard-disable bit, making
`00` silent and `F0`/`0F` exact endpoints even when fractional ATTEN/MPAN is
not honored (D44). The standalone patcher's Slice-to-kit path keeps one long WAV
unnormalized through shared gain/tanh, maps 1–8 equal slices to unique pads,
and leaves optional per-slice micro fades off by default so continuous
boundaries remain exact. It directly parses the WAV rate and uses band-limited
5,208.333 Hz conversion so duration/pitch are browser-independent; each
numbered waveform slice is directly clickable for preview/stop (D43).
The patcher always exposes zero-based KIT `00`–`07`; source banks with fewer
kits gain empty, fillable one-byte-silent pads on export, subject to the shared
pool capacity (D25).
A clean Option-1 tap stops PLAY/WAIT or, while
stopped,
starts all four tracks from the selected SONG/CHAIN/PHRASE context; its held
mute/solo layer remains unchanged (D28). Phrase `H` is a pre-row branch and
`H00` advances to the next chain phrase when present; each track loops only its
current contiguous vertical SONG group (D29). D31 adds a nine-page,
build-validated HELP screen above TABLE; it stops transport and cold-loads over
the idle PCM rings. D32 adds deterministic row-00 hierarchy entry, an in-page
INSTR selector, and field-safe TABLE command deletion. D18's B command is a
cumulative signed taps accumulator; B00 restores the active patch. D33 gives
TABLE a playhead for the explicitly selected top-bar track without adding
engine-tick work.

```

Python tools require `requirements.txt`; set `PYTHON=/path/to/python` when
using a virtual environment.

- Toolchain: **cc65** (Homebrew). `src/lowcode.s` works around a cc65 2.18
  lynx.cfg bug (optional LOWCODE segment vs defdir.s's unconditional
  `__LOWCODE_SIZE__` import) — keep it linked.
- `tools/emu/retroshot` (harness.c, ported from GENMDDJ) drives
  `handy_libretro.dylib` with **no lynxboot.img** — Handy HLE-boots the cart
  and logs a harmless BIOS warning. It captures the last frame (PPM→PNG) and
  the full audio (WAV) — the WAV is how sound milestones get FFT-verified.
- The core dylib is **repo-built from libretro-handy master +
  `tools/emu/handy-alynxdj.patch`** (two fixes: EEPROM file loads truncated
  to 1024 bytes at eeprom.cpp:59, and `handy_comlynx_*` C exports for the
  bridge). Rebuild: clone libretro-handy, `git apply` the patch,
  `make platform=osx`, copy the dylib into tools/emu/. Both fixes are
  upstream-PR-worthy (the EEPROM one especially).
- `tools/emu/duoshot` runs **two bridged core instances** (ComLynx
  cross-wired TX→RX) for two-unit sync tests: needs two *file copies* of
  the dylib (dlopen dedups identical paths). Per-unit scripts, WAV/PPM/RAM
  outputs. Verified: OUT→IN lock at −1.4 ms envelope lag.
- **cc65 lynx.h bug:** `_UART_TIMER` points at $FD14 = **timer 5**; timer 4
  (the real UART clock) is $FD10 — use explicit addresses (src/sync.c).
- BTN mask bits (RetroPad→Lynx, probed at M2): `$100`=A, `$1`=B, `$400`=Opt1,
  `$800`=Opt2, `$10`=Up, `$20`=Down, `$40`=Left, `$80`=Right, `$8`=Pause
  (START; lands in `SUZY.switches` bit 0, not the joystick byte).
- **A/B are swapped in firmware** (main.c reads `SUZY.joystick` then exchanges
  bits 0/1 — hardware ergonomics fix): the app's edit/insert (internal "A")
  fires on the *physical B* button = harness mask `$1`, and back/nav
  (internal "B") on *physical A* = `$100`. So in scripts the transport
  gesture is now **physical A-held then B** (`100@n,101@n,...`), the inverse
  of the old B-then-A. MANUAL/README control tables use physical labels.
- `RETROSHOT_RAM_OUT=<path>` dumps the full 64 KB RAM after a run — read any
  fixed address (e.g. debug mirrors) instead of scraping pixels.
- Regression artifacts live under `build/tests/<suite>/`; each suite clears
  and replaces only its own directory before running. Keep the top level of
  `build/` for canonical build products and compiler-generated inputs.
- RAM pressure is explicit: cart blocks 40/42/44 cold-load code to `$C900`,
  `$F600`, and `$F320`; the sample bank occupies blocks 45–249. HELP code is
  cart block 250 and its `AHD1` text is blocks 251–253; MIDI remains 254–255.
  The C stack is 512 bytes and `$D000-$D3FF` is normally two 512-byte rings.
  The 32 bytes beyond the visible framebuffer at `$BFE0-$BFFF` are PADRAM
  editor state; APPZP also owns compact editor flags, the four PCM heads,
  cart-reader scratch, the VBlank guard/counter, and the draw X offset.
  APPZP is not zeroed by crt0 on real hardware: every APPZP field that needs
  a defined boot value must be initialized explicitly. `vbl_install()` must
  clear the VBlank re-entry guard before enabling timer 2; otherwise a dirty
  guard leaves the UI alive but suppresses every sequencer tick.
  Entering HELP stops transport and cold-loads its renderer at `$D004` over
  those idle rings; FILES PURGE shares that stopped-only code overlay, and
  its scratch buffers are `$D3B0-$D3FF`. Keep
  `alynxdj.cfg`, `Makefile`, `src/main.c`, `src/pool.c`, and
  `sample-patch-browser.html` aligned.
- MIDI/sync, contextual-play, and editor cold code is packed into cart blocks
  254–255 and linked at `$C100-$C8FC`, overlaying the EEPROM pack buffer
  between SAVE/LOAD calls. `save_pack()`/runtime `save_load()` must mark the
  shared VBlank guard before the first buffer access. `midi_overlay_load()`
  reuses that byte as its 64-chunk countdown, so VBlank acknowledges and
  advances frames but skips the entire engine tick until both helper blocks
  are restored; never publish the overlay early.
  The MIDI RX ring overlays phrase pass counters at `$C048-$C087`, valid only
  because takeover stops the sequencer. `IN24` must retain those counters, so
  it has a separate 64-byte IRQ ring over the phrase clipboard at
  `$C088-$C0C7` with state at
  `$C0F9-$C0FB`; `$C0FC-$C0FF` holds the four per-track G countdowns.
  `$C8FD` is the HELP page; `$C8FE-$C8FF` hold the transient first/last
  visible block-selection rows. Reloading the full two-block helper window
  resets all three bytes; the selection bounds are ignored while SELECT is
  inactive.
  MIDI takeover reuses the four otherwise-zero `eng_walk[].active` bytes as
  absolute Pitch Bend targets; `engine_stop()` clears them on panic/mode
  changes, and the stopped-sequencer ownership makes this mutually exclusive
  with hierarchy walking.
  Fixed live bytes occupy `$C004-$C01F`; `$C01E/$C01F` hold the two KIT
  stream gain shifts. Preserve the post-pack
  reloads and these mutual-exclusion rules.
- Cart sample seeks use a software 16-bit bytes-remaining counter. Its low
  byte must be tested before decrement so `$0400` borrows to `$03FF`; getting
  that order wrong replays the preceding page at every 1 KB sample boundary.
  The kit-00 F4 ring regression in `test_hardware_fixes.py` covers two crosses.
- Sample refills retain the physical cart cursor while one voice owns it;
  directory reads invalidate `$C029`, and alternating voices re-seek. Refill
  in 64-byte pieces, publish every piece atomically, continue across the ring
  wrap in the same pump, and top up after playhead redraws. Full screen paints
  must yield every four glyphs, and `clear_grid()` must stay split into sixteen
  six-pixel bands; otherwise rendering can starve a pending trigger or ring.
  KIT gain shifts each signed 64-byte piece before its atomic publication;
  never move this work into the DAC IRQ. A trigger starts after a 384-byte
  cushion (~73.7 ms at D39's rate) and the caller's next pump tops up the
  remaining ring headroom.
  Same-track KIT retriggers leave the old stream live until `do_trigger()` has
  prepared the replacement. A single long chunk or a one-sided ring refill
  causes the IRQ to hold the last DAC value.
  KIT source RATE reuses the slot's WAV position/step bytes: step `0` repeats
  each byte once, while `1`–`4` advances normally or skips source bytes.
  The frame pump and render-time service points sustain 4×'s ~20.8 KB/s
  source consumption in short six-piece refill bursts. The IRQ clamps a
  stride that would cross `pcm_head`, so odd 3× steps and live rate changes
  cannot leap into unpublished/stale bytes.
  `$C027/$C028` are saturating slot-underrun counters; isolated and sustained
  sample/redraw rigs must complete at `00/00` in `test_hardware_fixes.py`;
  `$C02E/$C02F` count successfully started streams.
- `pico-midi-comlynx/` is the companion RP2040 USB/TRS-MIDI firmware. Its PIO
  output is open-drain (output-low/input only), 62.5 kbaud, start + 8 data +
  fixed-Space ninth + stop. It forwards channel 1–4 messages, divides every
  six source `F8` clocks into one row-rate `F8`, emits the first row grant
  immediately after `FA`/`FB`, and forwards `FC/FF`; ordinary forwarded
  channel traffic already includes CC74 and Pitch Bend, so those controls need
  no Pico-private protocol. UART0 on GP13 accepts an opto-isolated 31.25-kbaud
  serial MIDI source, expands running status, and shares the USB dispatcher;
  simultaneous sources are unsupported. `make pico-chipbridge` selects the
  Waveshare RP2040-Zero plus GP1 ComLynx and GP7 ready LED. It deliberately has
  no heartbeat and is not a USB host.
- Handy is dev-speed, not silicon: its LFSR-timbre and DAC-timing fidelity is
  suspect (DESIGN.md Q4) — hardware passes at M6/M7. **Measured 2026-07-16:
  this core renders every FEEDBACK/tap config identically** (static square
  vs noise FFTs are bit-identical, cosine 1.0000) — it does not emulate the
  LFSR feedback at all. So TAPS, the `N` override, and the `G` tap-glide
  can't be heard or FFT-verified in Handy; verify them at the register level
  (dump the voice shadow / `sh_feedback`) and on real hardware only.
- **cc65 comparison gotcha:** `int_var > uchar_var` can compile as an
  *unsigned* compare — a negative int silently becomes huge (bit the L
  slide: it diverged an octave down). Cast explicitly:
  `int r = (int)uchar_var;` then compare against `r`.
- Boot starts with `song_clear()` and **autoloads** a valid EEPROM save over
  it; the factory `song_demo()` is loaded only through FILES → DEMO. Use a
  unique ROM basename for save/demo/rig tests to isolate the emulator EEPROM
  namespace. With no valid machine config the default palette is `01`; a valid
  stored OPTIONS palette still overrides it.
- **ElCheapoSD for Lynx is not song-save compatible:** it contains a physical
  128-byte 93C46 only, while ALYNXDJ requires a 2 KB 93C86. It can run the ROM
  but cannot persist a full song, and its cart API is menu-oriented rather
  than general SD file access. A 128-byte `.sav` cannot be padded or migrated.
  The **RetroHQ Lynx GameDrive is hardware-verified** for SAVE, LOAD, and
  non-volatile ALYNXDJ song recovery with the complete EEPROM backing size.

## The reference projects (read before designing anything)

The sibling trackers are the specification for how ALYNXDJ should *feel*. Their
AGENTS.md, `DESIGN.md`, `PLAN.md`, and `SAVEFORMAT.md` files are the reference:

- **`/Users/a1106632/Documents/sms_tracker`** (SMSGGDJ) — the original, shipped and
  hardware-verified. Source of the data model (phrase → chain → song + pools),
  the command set, grooves/tables, the flat contiguous save image, and the
  **control-scheme contract**: two modifier buttons (project-level and item-level),
  "the button already held when another arrives selects the action", **no
  simultaneous-press timing windows** (only paste double-taps).
- **`/Users/a1106632/Documents/genmddj`** (GENMDDJ) — the first port; its AGENTS.md
  §"What ports verbatim vs what's new" is the template for the same analysis here.
  Its `tools/emu/retroshot` libretro screenshot harness is the model for headless
  verification (a Lynx libretro core such as handy/mednafen-lynx should slot into
  the same pattern), and its Makefile + Python tool pipeline (makefont.py,
  maketables.py, sample conversion) is the model for the build.

Process discipline inherited from both: **DESIGN.md is the contract** once written
(with a decision log — don't re-litigate settled decisions), SAVEFORMAT.md stays in
sync with any RAM-layout change, work proceeds in milestones from PLAN.md with a
commit at each boundary, a git-hash **build stamp on the boot splash** to catch
stale flashes, and per-region timing tables where applicable.

## Assets already present

- `samples/` — WAV source material for the sample pool, organised as 8-slot kits,
  mirroring the sibling projects' sample pipeline:
  - `01 808`, `02 909`, `03 C78`, `04 606` — drum-machine kits, 8 one-shots each,
    named `NN XX.wav` (BD/SD/HH/…).
  - `05 speech 1` … `08 speech 4` — speech/phoneme banks (AA.wav, AE.wav, …).
  - `alynxdj-factory-samples.bin` is the portable, build-ready 64-slot factory
    bank. `tools/alynxdj_pool.py` rebuilds/validates it; the browser imports and
    exports the same rate-ID-1 `PL` format. Slots are u16-sized (65,535 bytes,
    ~12.58 seconds at 5,208.333 Hz), and the 256 KB ROM reserves 209,920 bytes
    for the complete bank.
- `artwork/` — empty; destined for logo/splash art (siblings use an `art/` dir with
  a makelogo.py-style pipeline).
- `task.txt` — the original project brief.

## Hardware quick facts (full picture: DESIGN.md §1)

65C02 @ ~4 MHz, **64 KB unified RAM — code, song, and framebuffer all live in
it** (the cart is a block-serial device, streamed not mapped). Video 160×102
4bpp framebuffer, ~59.9 Hz with the current crt0 timing. Mikey audio: 4 identical channels ($FD20+8n), each
a 12-bit LFSR polynomial counter = square / pitched noise / integrate ramps,
**or a directly-written 8-bit signed DAC** (the PCM path). Stereo ATTEN on
Lynx II only (write-always, D8). ComLynx UART = the sync bus. Saves go to a
93Cxx EEPROM, **2 KB max** — the design's tightest constraint. cc65's
`_mikey.h`/`_suzy.h` (in `/opt/homebrew/share/cc65/include/`) are the local
authoritative register maps.
