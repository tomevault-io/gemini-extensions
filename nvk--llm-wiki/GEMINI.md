# LLM Wiki — Agent Instructions

> This is an "idea file" in the spirit of [Karpathy's LLM Wiki](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/442a6bf555914893e9891c11519de94f). Paste it into any LLM agent (OpenAI Codex, Claude Code, OpenCode, Gemini Code Assist, or similar) and it will build and manage a wiki for you. The agent customizes the specifics; this file communicates the system.

> **Editing the llm-wiki repo itself?** This file is the portable wiki *protocol* for end users. The dev contract for the plugin codebase (testing, sync workflow, project structure, symlink invariant) lives in [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) — read it in addition to this file. Both Claude Code and Codex agents working on the repo should treat `CLAUDE.md` as the source of truth for repo-level workflow.

## What This Is

An LLM-compiled knowledge base. You (the LLM agent) are both the compiler and the query engine. Raw source documents are ingested, then incrementally compiled into a wiki of interconnected markdown articles. The human rarely edits the wiki directly — that's your domain.

**The metaphor**: raw sources are source code, you are the compiler, the wiki is the executable.

## Architecture

### Hub Path

Defaults to `~/wiki/`. Optionally configured via `~/.config/llm-wiki/config.json`:

```json
{ "hub_path": "~/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/wiki" }
```

If the config exists, use `hub_path` (expand `~`) instead of `~/wiki/` everywhere below. Store as **HUB**. Use `/wiki config hub-path <path>` to set it up, or create the JSON manually.

### Hub (~/wiki/)

The hub is lightweight — NO content, just a registry.

```
~/wiki/                         # or custom path from config.json
├── wikis.json          # Registry of all topic wikis
├── _index.md           # Lists topic wikis with stats
├── log.md              # Global activity log
└── topics/
    ├── nutrition/      # Each topic is a full, isolated wiki
    ├── robotics/
    └── ...
```

### Topic Wiki (~/wiki/topics/<name>/)

All content lives here. One topic per wiki. Isolated indexes, focused queries.

```
~/wiki/topics/<name>/
├── .obsidian/                     # Obsidian vault config (optional)
├── _index.md                      # Master index: stats, navigation, recent changes
├── config.md                      # Title, scope, conventions
├── log.md                         # Activity log for this topic
├── inbox/                         # Drop zone — user dumps files here
│   └── .processed/
├── raw/                           # Immutable source material

```

### Local Wiki (.wiki/)

Same structure as a topic wiki but at `<project>/.wiki/`. Add `.wiki/` to `.gitignore`.

## Core Principles

1. **One topic, one wiki.** Never mix unrelated topics. The hub is just a registry.
2. **Indexes are navigation.** Every directory has `_index.md` with a contents table. Read indexes first, never scan blindly. Keep them current.
3. **Raw is immutable.** Once ingested, sources are never modified. All synthesis happens in `wiki/`.
4. **Articles are synthesized, not copied.** Draw from multiple sources, contextualize, connect. Think textbook, not clipboard.
5. **Dual-linking.** Every cross-reference uses both formats on the same line: `[[slug|Name]] ([Name](../category/slug.md))`. Obsidian reads the wikilink, the agent reads the markdown link, GitHub renders it. Not locked into any tool.
6. **Incremental by default.** Only compile new sources unless explicitly asked for full recompile.
7. **Honest gaps.** If the wiki doesn't have the answer, say so. Suggest what to ingest.
8. **Multi-wiki peek.** When querying, answer from the target wiki, then peek at sibling wiki `_index.md` files for overlap.
9. **Confidence scoring.** Articles get `confidence: high|medium|low` in frontmatter based on source quality.
10. **Activity log.** Append every operation to `log.md`. Format: `## [YYYY-MM-DD] operation | Description`. Never edit existing entries.

## File Formats

### _index.md (every directory)

```markdown
# [Directory Name] Index

> [One-line description]

Last updated: YYYY-MM-DD

## Contents

| File | Summary | Tags | Updated |
|------|---------|------|---------|
| [file.md](file.md) | One-sentence summary | tag1, tag2 | YYYY-MM-DD |

## Categories

- **category**: file1.md, file2.md

## Recent Changes

- YYYY-MM-DD: Description
```

Master `_index.md` additionally has Statistics and Quick Navigation sections.

### Raw Source (raw/)

```yaml
---
title: "Title"
source: "URL or filepath or MANUAL"
type: articles|papers|repos|notes|data
ingested: YYYY-MM-DD
tags: [tag1, tag2]
summary: "2-3 sentence summary"
---
```

### Wiki Article (wiki/)

```yaml
---
title: "Article Title"
category: concept|topic|reference
sources: [raw/type/file1.md, raw/type/file2.md]
created: YYYY-MM-DD
updated: YYYY-MM-DD
tags: [tag1, tag2]
aliases: [alternate names]
confidence: high|medium|low
summary: "2-3 sentence summary"
---
```

Body includes abstract, sections, `## See Also` (dual-links, bidirectional), `## Sources` (links to raw/).

### wikis.json

```json
{
  "default": "~/wiki",
  "wikis": {
    "hub": { "path": "~/wiki", "description": "Hub" },
    "<name>": { "path": "~/wiki/topics/<name>", "description": "..." }
  },
  "local_wikis": []
}
```

### log.md

```
## [YYYY-MM-DD] operation | Description
```

Operations: `init`, `ingest`, `compile`, `query`, `lint`, `research`, `thesis`, `output`, `assess`

## Operations

### Init

Create a topic wiki. Always require a topic name. If the hub doesn't exist, create it first (just wikis.json + _index.md + log.md + topics/). Create the full topic wiki structure, empty _index.md files, config.md, log.md, and optionally .obsidian/ vault config.

### Ingest

Convert external material into a raw source file.

- **URLs**: Fetch content, extract title/author/date/text, write to `raw/articles/` or `raw/papers/`
- **Files**: Read directly, preserve formatting
- **Text**: User provides quoted text, write to `raw/notes/`
- **Inbox**: Scan `inbox/` for dumped files, process each by type, move to `inbox/.processed/`

Auto-detect type: arxiv/scholar → papers, github → repos, .csv/.json → data, everything else → articles.

**Auto-classify** (when no `--wiki` specified): After fetching content, match against topic wiki scopes. Single items get a numbered choice (pick wiki, create new, or skip). Batch/inbox mode presents a classification table for bulk routing. Skipped when `--wiki` or `--local` is explicit.

Slug: `YYYY-MM-DD-descriptive-slug.md`. Update all indexes after each ingestion. If 5+ uncompiled sources, suggest compilation.

### Compile

Transform raw sources into wiki articles. Incremental by default (only new sources).

1. Survey: read indexes, identify uncompiled sources
2. Extract: key concepts, facts, relationships from each source
3. Map: which concepts need new articles vs updates to existing
4. Classify: concept (bounded idea), topic (broad theme), reference (curated list)
5. Write: synthesized articles with dual-links, frontmatter, confidence scores, aliases
6. Bidirectional links: if A links to B, ensure B links to A
7. Update all indexes

### Query

Answer questions from wiki content only. Three depths:

- **Quick**: Read indexes only. Fastest.
- **Standard** (default): Read relevant articles + full-text search. Follow See Also links.
- **Deep**: Read everything, search raw sources, peek sibling wikis.

Always cite sources. Note confidence levels. Identify gaps. Never use training data — only wiki content.

### Research

Automated pipeline: search → ingest → compile. Launch parallel agents. Auto-detects input type.

**Input detection**: If the input is a question (starts with what/why/how, contains "?", phrased as a goal), enters Question Mode. Otherwise, Topic Mode.

**Topic Mode** — explore a subject area:
- **Standard (5 agents)**: Academic, Technical, Applied, News/Trends, Contrarian
- **Deep (8 agents)**: Adds Historical, Adjacent fields, Data/Stats
- **Retardmax (10 agents)**: Adds 2 Rabbit Hole agents. Skip planning, ingest aggressively.

**Question Mode** — answer a specific question with a deliverable:
1. Decompose into 3-5 sub-questions (what/why/how/who/data)
2. One agent per sub-question (focused, not generic angles)
3. Compile into wiki articles + a synthesis "playbook" topic article
4. Auto-generate a playbook output artifact (the actionable deliverable)
5. Suggest 2-3 testable theses from findings → feed into `--mode thesis`

**Modifiers**: `--new-topic` (create wiki + research in one shot), `--mode thesis "<claim>"` (thesis-driven research with for/against framing and verdict), `--min-time <duration>` (sustained multi-round research), `--sources <N>` (per round).

Each agent receives a standardized prompt template: Objective, Context, Current wiki state, Constraints, Return format, Quality scoring guide (5=peer-reviewed → 1=spam). Deduplicate across agents.

**Phase 2b: Credibility Review** — after agents return, before ingestion: score each source on peer-review status (+2), recency (+1), author authority (+1), vendor primary source (-1), potential bias (-1), corroboration (+1 per agent, max +2). Tiers: High (4-6) → Medium (2-3) → Low (0-1) → Reject (<0). Bias signals do not stack.

**Session Registry** (`--min-time`): Persists `.research-session.json` in wiki root — tracks round number, sources, articles, gaps, progress score. Enables crash recovery (resume from last completed round). Deleted on completion.

**Progress Scoring**: Each round scored 0-100: sources×3 + articles×5 + cross-refs×2 + credibility×4. Trajectory triggers: 3 consecutive declines totaling 30+ points → warn. Score ≥80 + no gaps → early completion. Score <40 → change strategy.

**Plan Reflection**: Between rounds, reflect holistically on ALL prior findings (not just latest gaps). Priority: draw cross-topic connections → update cross-references → re-evaluate gaps → score remaining gaps (Impact × Feasibility × Specificity) → adjust direction only if clearly needed.

Compile all ingested sources. Report gaps and suggest follow-ups.

### Thesis (mode of Research)

Thesis-driven research. Activated via `--mode thesis "<claim>"` on the research command. Previously a separate `/wiki:thesis` command (merged to eliminate duplicated infrastructure).

1. Decompose thesis into: core claim, key variables, testable prediction, falsification criteria, scope boundary
2. Agents split by purpose: Supporting, Opposing, Mechanistic, Meta/Review, Adjacent (+ Historical, Quantitative, Confounders in deep mode)
3. The thesis is the bloat filter — sources irrelevant to the claim's variables get skipped
4. Compile evidence into wiki articles + a thesis file with evidence tables (for/against/nuance)
5. Verdict: Supported / Partially Supported / Contradicted / Insufficient Evidence / Mixed (with confidence level)
6. Anti-confirmation-bias: in `--min-time` mode, Round 2 focuses harder on the WEAKER side of Round 1's evidence
7. Suggest follow-up theses derived from findings

### Retract

Remove a regretted source and clean up its downstream effects. Requires `--reason`.

1. **Identify**: Find the source file (by path or filename search)
2. **Map blast radius**: Grep all wiki articles for references — classify as frontmatter, body-inline, or see-also
3. **Clean up articles**: Remove metadata references, flag inline claims with `<!--RETRACTED-SOURCE-->` markers
4. **Delete raw source**: Remove file, update all indexes
5. **Log**: Permanent retraction record with reason
6. **Recompile** (optional `--recompile`): Rewrite flagged sections from remaining sources, remove markers
7. **Report**: Summary of changes + remaining review items

`--dry-run` shows blast radius without making changes. If a source is the only source for an article, warn prominently.

### Lint

Health checks with auto-fix capability. Lint **is** the migration path — there is no separate `/wiki:migrate` command. A file in the wrong place from an old wiki layout and a file in the wrong place from user error are treated as the same defect. Two layers:

- **Mechanical (C11/C12/C13)** — `raw/` + `wiki/` file placement and frontmatter schema. Fully auto-fixable.
- **Project-level (C8/C9)** — `output/projects/` structure, `WHY.md` presence, staleness detection, and grouping candidates. Migration of legacy `_project.md` manifests (from pre-v0.2 wikis) is auto-fixed (C8c); everything else is surfaced as suggestions or ready-to-paste commands.

**Checks**: structure integrity, frontmatter validity (plus legacy key/value aliases C13), canonical placement of raw/wiki files (C11), unknown-file quarantine for raw/wiki/root (C12), index consistency, link integrity, source provenance (dangling refs, unresolved retraction markers), tag hygiene, coverage, project `WHY.md` presence (C8a), project staleness via source chain (C8b), legacy `_project.md` migration to `WHY.md` (C8c), project candidates (C9), deep fact-checking (optional).

**Auto-fix** (`--fix`): rewrite legacy frontmatter keys/values to canonical (C13), move misplaced raw/wiki files to their canonical directory (C11), quarantine unknown files to `inbox/.unknown/` (C12), migrate legacy `_project.md` to `WHY.md` (C8c), missing indexes, orphan files, dead index entries, statistics mismatch, missing bidirectional links, empty frontmatter fields, dangling source references, regenerate projects-aware `output/_index.md`. Never auto-delete unknown directories. Never auto-create `WHY.md` with placeholder goals (C8a is warn-only — manufactured rationale is worse than missing). Never auto-move files into projects (C9 is human-authored via `/wiki:project`). On slug collisions during a placement move, skip and warn.

**Schema evolution**: when canonical paths or frontmatter fields for `raw/` or `wiki/` change, update the rules in `skills/wiki-manager/references/linting.md` (C11 placement map, C12 allowlist, C13 alias table). When the project model changes, update C8/C9 and `projects.md`. Never write version-specific migration code. Lint rules are the schema.

### Search

Find content by keyword, tag, or category. Scan indexes first (fast), then full-text search.

### Output

Generate artifacts from wiki content: summary, report, study-guide, slides, timeline, glossary, comparison.

**Retardmax mode**: Read ALL articles, generate immediately without planning structure. Ship rough, iterate later.

Save to `output/`. Update indexes.

### Assess

Compare a local repo against wiki research + market.

1. **Repo scan** (3 parallel agents): structure, features, docs
2. **Wiki scan**: knowledge map from indexes and articles
3. **Gap analysis**: alignment, research gaps (repo does it, wiki doesn't), opportunities (wiki knows it, repo doesn't), neither covers
4. **Market scan** (3-5 parallel agents): competitors, best practices, emerging trends

Output: comparison report with feature matrix, competitive landscape, and recommended actions (specific research and build suggestions).

## Structural Guardian

Auto-run lightweight checks after write operations:

1. Hub should only have wikis.json, _index.md, log.md, topics/. Delete anything else.
2. Index freshness: file counts match index rows. Auto-fix mismatches.
3. Orphan detection: files not in any index → add them.
4. Missing directories → create with empty _index.md.
5. wikis.json sync: all topic dirs registered, no ghost entries.

Silent when clean. Auto-fix trivial issues. Warn on structural problems. Never block the user.

## File Naming

- Raw sources: `YYYY-MM-DD-descriptive-slug.md`
- Wiki articles: `descriptive-slug.md` (no date — living documents)
- Output artifacts: `{type}-{topic-slug}-{YYYY-MM-DD}.md`
- All lowercase, hyphens, no special chars, max 60 chars

## Tag Convention

Lowercase, hyphenated. Specific over general (`transformer-architecture` not `ai`). Normalize — no near-duplicates.

## Obsidian Compatibility

Each topic wiki can be opened as an Obsidian vault. The `.obsidian/` config is created on init with sane defaults. Dual-links power the graph view. Aliases enable search by alternate names. Tags are natively read. The hub has NO `.obsidian/` to avoid nested vault confusion.

## Platform-Specific Notes

This AGENTS.md works with any LLM agent that can read/write files and search the web. Adapt tool names as needed:

| Capability | Claude Code | OpenAI Codex | Generic |
|-----------|------------|-------------|---------|
| Read file | `Read` | `file_read` | read the file |
| Write file | `Write` | `file_write` | write the file |
| Edit file | `Edit` | `file_edit` | edit the file |
| Search files | `Grep` | `shell(grep)` | search file contents |
| Find files | `Glob` | `shell(find)` | find files by pattern |
| Web search | `WebSearch` | `browser` | search the web |
| Fetch URL | `WebFetch` | `browser` | fetch URL content |
| Run command | `Bash` | `shell` | run shell command |
| Subagents | `Agent` | parallel tasks | spawn parallel work |
