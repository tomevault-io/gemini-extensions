# OKF Studio

A cross-platform **desktop workspace** (Windows + Ubuntu, macOS for free) that autodetects OKF bundles, renders their connected concepts as a graph and reader, and lets the user connect an external ACP agent or Studio Agent to create, curate, and query knowledge through explicit context and reviewed writes. Built with **Tauri 2.0** — a Rust core plus the system webview.

## How it's put together

The **Rust core** (`crates/okf-core` + `src-tauri/`) owns filesystem, process, and network mediation: it [scans a folder for bundles](docs/architecture/bundle-detection.md), [parses concepts/links/backlinks](docs/architecture/okf-parsing.md), [validates](docs/features/validation.md), [watches for changes](docs/features/live-reload.md), and hosts explicit [agent connections](docs/architecture/agent-system.md). Its typed [command/event surface](docs/architecture/ipc-and-security.md) hands the **React 19 + TypeScript frontend** (`src/`, Vite, React Compiler enabled — no manual memoization) ready-to-render state. The frontend combines the [graph](docs/features/graph-view.md), [concept reader](docs/features/concept-reader.md), [search](docs/features/search-and-filter.md), [navigation](docs/features/navigation.md), and [Agent Panel](docs/features/agent-panel.md). Folder opening remains read-only; agent processes and network actions start only after explicit user actions.

```

```

**The spec in [`docs/`](docs/) is the source of truth.** Read it before changing behavior, and keep it in sync when you do. Start at [`docs/index.md`](docs/index.md):

- **What it is / why:** [`docs/product/overview.md`](docs/product/overview.md), [`docs/product/principles.md`](docs/product/principles.md), [`docs/product/scope-and-non-goals.md`](docs/product/scope-and-non-goals.md)
- **What it does:** the [`docs/features/`](docs/features/) concepts — folder autodetect, bundle browser, graph view, concept reader, search & filter, navigation, validation, live reload.
- **How it feels:** [`docs/ux/`](docs/ux/) — first run, browsing layout, keyboard shortcuts, theming.
- **How it's built:** [`docs/architecture/`](docs/architecture/) — tech stack, bundle detection, OKF parsing, data model, IPC & security.
- **External specs:** [`docs/reference/`](docs/reference/) — OKF spec summary, Tauri 2.0 notes, glossary.

If anything in this file conflicts with the bundle, the bundle wins; update this file to match.

## Where code lives (folder structure)

Both the frontend and the agent backend are organized **domain-first**: the domain is the top-level unit, and narrower separation (`components/`, sub-parsers) nests *inside* it. Group by feature first, then by kind — never a global `components/` tree beside a parallel utilities tree. When you add a file, place it in its domain, not at the root.

**Frontend (`src/`).** Domains live under `src/features/<domain>/`, each owning a `components/` folder beside its own logic:

- `agent/` — ACP client (connection, catalog, install, threads, local models, custom profiles) + agent-panel components + staged-write review previews
- `git/` — repository snapshot and diff state + Git panel, focus contract, and dedicated diff workspace
- `viz/` — the graph engine (`graph/`), chart helpers, and every graph/chart component
- `reader/` — concept reader, prefs, lineage panel, peek card + lineage derivation
- `bundle/` — Bundle Home, bundle details and sharing, bundle browsing, and open-from-URL (`remoteSource` parser)
- `navigation/` — sidebar, index tree, tag browser, type filters
- `shell/` — window frame and global overlays (top/status/activity bar, tabs, command palette, settings, validation/log panels)

Cross-cutting code lives in `src/shared/`: `ipc`, `store`, `types`, `query`, `selectors`, `odsf`, `theme`, `render/` (markdown/math/mermaid/highlight), `platform/` (native/window/updater/platform), and `styles/` (`baseui.css`, `chrome.css`). Only the composition root stays at the `src/` top level — `App`, `main`, `keys` — plus `mock/` and `test/` infrastructure and the `integration/` lane. Full-app journeys live in `src/integration/`, named for the surface they cover (`connections.test.tsx`, `shell.test.tsx`), because they belong to no single domain; the directory, not a filename infix, is what puts them in that lane. A component's own `.css` and `.test` file sit beside it.

**Imports use the `@/` alias** (`@/*` → `src/*`, set in `tsconfig.json` `paths` + Vite `resolve.alias`), never relative `../../` chains. Alias paths are location-independent, so moving a file only repoints references instead of rewriting relative paths — new code should import via `@/…`. Per-component `.css` imports stay relative (`./Name.css`) so they follow the component.

**Backend (`src-tauri/src/`).** Agent code is grouped under `src/agent/` by domain: `host/` (protocol, process, sandbox, mcp, transcript), `registry/` (catalog, install, runtime, custom), `provider/` (local, native sources/stage, studio, credentials), and `sources/` (pdf, csv, json, url). Rust modules are relocated with `#[path]` attributes so a file move doesn't force a module rename. Note the frontend's `src/features/agent/catalog.json` is read by Rust via `include_str!` in `src-tauri/src/agent/registry/agent_catalog.rs` — if you move it, update that path (and re-run `cargo check -p okf-viewer`).

The layout is documented in [`docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md`](docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md); keep it in sync when the structure changes.

## Dev commands

Prerequisites (see [`docs/reference/tauri-2.md`](docs/reference/tauri-2.md)): rustup, which installs the toolchain pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml`, + Node.js with pnpm. On Ubuntu also `webkit2gtk` (4.1) dev libs, `build-essential`, `libssl-dev`, `librsvg2-dev`; on Windows the WebView2 runtime + MSVC build tools; on macOS the Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`).

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev            # frontend only, in a browser (mock bundle) — fastest for UI work
pnpm storybook      # component playground on :6006 — per-component states on the app's real tokens
pnpm tauri dev      # the full app with hot reload
pnpm tauri build    # installers: .msi/.exe (Windows), .deb/AppImage (Ubuntu), .app/.dmg (macOS)
```

**Storybook is also an agent surface.** The dev server mounts `@storybook/addon-mcp` at `http://localhost:6006/mcp` (registered in the repo-root `.mcp.json`): with it running you can enumerate components/stories and author new ones through the addon's tools. Stories are colocated `src/**/*.stories.tsx`; a new or restyled component state gets a story there, not another ad-hoc fixture (`?agent-gallery` stays for whole-panel compositions). **Stories are tests**: interactive ones carry `play` functions, and `pnpm test:stories` runs every story headless in Chromium — run it when components or stories change. Store-bound components wrap in the `WithStore` harness (`src/mock/withStore.tsx`), which boots the real `AppProvider` over the browser mock. Per-story screenshots come from `http://localhost:6006/iframe.html?id=<story-id>`. Keep ad hoc captures outside the repository; add an image to `docs/ux/` only when a named Markdown concept links it as curated evidence. See [`docs/architecture/testing.md`](docs/architecture/testing.md).

## A user-facing feature ships on three surfaces

Every user-facing change lands on **code, spec, and site in the same change** — never code alone:

1. **Code** (`src/`, `crates/`, `src-tauri/`) — the behavior itself, plus the mock fixture (`src/mock/fixture.ts`) exercising it.
2. **Spec** (`docs/`) — the matching concept(s) and a `log.md` entry ([details below](#always-read-docs-and-keep-it-in-sync)).
3. **Site** (`site/`) — the marketing copy a visitor reads ([details below](#keep-the-marketing-site-in-sync-it-is-the-products-shop-window)).

A feature that exists only in code is invisible to the spec and unsold to visitors; treat a missing surface as an unfinished change.

## Always read `docs/`, and keep it in sync

`docs/` is the source of truth — an OKF bundle that specifies what the app does and why, and which the app renders as its built-in sample. This is a standing rule for every change, by humans and agents alike:

1. **Read the relevant concept(s) before you change behavior.** The reasoning for features, flows, and architecture lives in `docs/`, not in code comments. Start at [`docs/index.md`](docs/index.md) and follow the map above.
2. **Update the spec in the same change.** Any new or changed feature, flow, or decision updates the matching concept(s) so the spec never drifts from the code. On conflict, the bundle wins — change the code or the bundle so they agree.
3. **Record decisions in the bundle, not just the commit message.** A notable choice (a stack decision, a non-goal, a tradeoff) belongs in the relevant concept and a dated [`docs/log.md`](docs/log.md) entry.
4. **Leave it conformant.** Follow the checklist in [Keep the `docs/` bundle in sync](#keep-the-docs-bundle-in-sync-it-is-an-okf-v01-bundle) below and run `node scripts/okf-validate.mjs docs` (0 errors) before finishing.

## Keep the marketing site in sync (it is the product's shop window)

[`site/`](site/) is the landing/download page. It must always reflect what the product actually does — feature copy that lags the app undersells it, and copy that leads the app lies:

- **When a user-facing feature ships, update the site's copy in the same change** (the feature cards and showcase sections in `site/src/pages/index.astro`), the way `docs/` is updated in the same change.
- **Never describe what the screenshots don't show.** Screenshot-adjacent copy is bound to the image next to it; feature-card copy is not. When the app's look changes materially, recapture the shots (`site/public/`, 1760×1117, hand-captured from the desktop app).
- **Respect the site's own contract** ([`site/README.md`](site/README.md)): visual language comes from the [`design-system/`](design-system/) ODSF bundle via `sync-ds.mjs` — never edit `site/src/styles/design-system/*` by hand; copy is plain and concrete, no em dashes.
- **The site is its own pnpm project**, with its own lockfile and its own pinned pnpm. `site/pnpm-workspace.yaml` marks it as a workspace root so pnpm stops walking up to the app's; without it the app's workspace captures the site and installs nothing there, and the Pages build fails on a missing `astro`.
- **Gate it separately:** `pnpm --dir site build` (it deploys via the [Pages workflow](.github/workflows/pages.yml), not the app CI). The bundle's own conformance check, `node .claude/skills/odsf/odsf-validate.mjs design-system`, **now runs in app CI** rather than only here: since its brand roles are declared to track `src/styles.css`, an app theme change can break it, so the two are no longer separable.
- **A theme change is two changes.** [`design-system/`](design-system/) was derived from the app's dark theme, and its brand roles — `primary`, `primary-hover`, `focus`, `error`, `warning`, `success` — are declared to track `src/styles.css`. **Touching a color role in the app means updating the bundle in the same change**, or moving the row into the "deliberately differ" table in [`foundations/color.md`](design-system/foundations/color.md) with the reason. Its surfaces and text roles are deliberately not shared: a marketing page is one scroll on a near-black canvas, the app is a dense tool window with five stacked surfaces. `pnpm check:ds` enforces the tracking table, the frontmatter-to-`tokens.css` projection, and the documented contrast ratios, so this is a gate rather than a note.

## Writing for the repository, not for the thread

Everything published to GitHub is read by strangers, months later, with no access to the conversation that produced it: commit messages, pull request titles and descriptions, issue text, review comments, release notes, **and everything that ships inside the code itself, including comments, test names, error strings, and log messages**. Write for that reader. This is a public repository, and the working session is not part of the record. The **`no-slop`** skill applies to all of it.

1. **Address the change, never a person.** No second person, no "yours to do", no offers or questions directed at whoever opens the page. A requirement is stated as a requirement ("Requires a new `APT_GPG_PRIVATE_KEY` repository secret"), not as an instruction to a reader. Work that needs a human decision is a stated prerequisite or an issue, not a question in a description.
2. **A comment explains the code, never the change.** This is the one that gets violated most, because the reasoning is freshest while the change is being made. A comment that says what a line used to do, which bug it replaced, what an earlier draft got wrong, or what a past investigation measured is written for a reviewer who reads it once, and then it is stranded in a file that outlives the review and goes stale where nobody is looking. That reasoning goes in the commit message. What stays in the file is the durable *why*: a non-obvious constraint, a platform quirk, a spec or security reason, stated in the present tense about the code as it now is. If a comment only makes sense to someone who saw the diff, delete it. After any change, the file should carry no more comments than before unless the code itself got harder to follow.
3. **Keep the session out of it.** Nothing that only parses from inside the working context: no "as discussed", "as I mentioned", "I ran it four times", "fails here", "on this machine", "still running". A local observation is either generalized into a fact about the repository or dropped. A check that fails for reasons specific to one developer's machine is not pull-request material at all.
4. **A description is not a transcript.** A pull request answers four things: what changed, why, what a reviewer should check, and what is not covered. Investigation narrative, every alternative weighed in order, and everything learned along the way are not part of that. A rejected alternative gets one line and its reason, not a section. Reasoning that deserves to survive belongs in the relevant `docs/` concept and a `log.md` entry, which the description links to; that split is the one this repo already uses (see [Always read `docs/`](#always-read-docs-and-keep-it-in-sync)).
5. **Write what stays true after the merge.** A description is a permanent record, not a status bulletin. Drop anything that expires: what is currently running, what was just fixed mid-review, what happens next in the session. Prerequisites and follow-up work are fine when phrased as standing facts rather than as this moment's state.
6. **Claims name their evidence.** "Verified" means the command and its result, so a reader can rerun it. Not "I tested it", not "works as expected". State what is not covered with the same directness.
7. **Release notes are written for users.** They describe what a person can now do, what visibly changed, and what upgrading requires. They are not the commit list, not internal module names, and not the build's own history. Version numbers follow semver against user-visible impact, and a release that reorders results or changes an exported format says so under upgrading.

House style for all of it: conventional-commit titles (`feat(reader): …`, `fix(agent): …`), plain and concrete prose, no em dashes, no marketing register, no emoji headings, no badge walls, and no bold-everything. A pull request description fits this shape:

```markdown
One or two sentences: what this changes and why it exists.

## Background            # only when the reason is not obvious from the title
## Implementation        # behaviour and structure, not a diff walkthrough
## Verification          # commands run and their results; what is not covered
## Prerequisites         # secrets, migrations, ordering; only if any exist
```

## Reviewing your own work (be the critic, not the cheerleader)

Default stance: **assume the first attempt is mediocre** — code and UI both regress to the mean of training data — until proven otherwise against explicit criteria. The job of review is to find what is wrong, not to confirm what is right. A first-pass review that finds nothing is itself suspect; scan again.

1. **No vibe sign-offs.** "Looks clean / good / modern / polished / production-ready" is banned as evidence. "Clean" is a conclusion earned *after* a scan, never a first impression. Every claim about the UI must cite either a specific check that passed or a screenshot examined against named criteria.
2. **Run the skills, and treat their findings as a gate.** Before calling any UI change done:
   - **`visual-consistency`** — the measurable half of this catalog now runs as an assertion after **every** story (`.storybook/visualConsistency.ts`, enforced by `pnpm test:stories`): off-scale gaps, prose with no reading measure, repeated rows that disagree on height, hit targets under 24px, and content clipped with no affordance. Each finding names an element and a number. It found 86 of 297 stories failing on its first run; keep it at zero rather than re-deriving it by eye. Then scan the changed surface for what it cannot measure: spacing on a 4/8 scale via tokens, a bounded type scale with paired line-heights, alignment, repeated-element consistency (button size, radius, elevation), focus rings, touch targets, overflow, tables. Read the catalog first.
   - **`theme-colors`** — no hex/`rgba()`/`hsl()` literals in components; every color from a token. Literals live only in the theme definition (`src/styles.css` palette, `src/shared/theme.ts`). Run **`pnpm check:theme`** with it: `check:tokens` catches `var(--nope)`, which is invalid at computed-value time and fails silently (it found 40 on its first run, including a focus ring that never drew); `check:contrast` re-derives all 108 AA pairings per theme, including ink on the state fills, which a hand-check kept missing; `check:ds` keeps the design-system bundle in step.
   - **`react-stinky`** — component/hook/TS smells and semantic markup (roles, labels, keyboard).
   - **`no-slop`** — for any human-facing prose (UI copy, docs, commit messages).
   Apply Safe findings; surface Judgment ones. Do not report "done" with an unaddressed Glaring finding.
3. **Verify with evidence, at two widths.** Screenshot the rendered screen at narrow (~360px) and wide, and check the loading, empty, and error states — not just the happy path. A green build is not visual proof. Prefer the real screen over reasoning about the code. (Fast path: `pnpm dev` + the `agent-browser` skill — see the visual-verification note. For a single component's states, `pnpm storybook` and screenshot the story iframe.)
4. **Measure against modern UX floors, not the training average.** Spacing from `--space-*` tokens (4/8); a bounded type scale (≤ ~7 sizes) with paired line-heights from tokens; WCAG AA contrast (4.5:1 text, 3:1 UI); one visible, consistent focus-ring token; touch targets ≥ 24px; `prefers-reduced-motion` respected; one radius and one elevation scale; empty/loading/error states actually designed. If you cannot point to the token or the criterion, it is not done.
5. **Pressure-test design calls — including the user's.** Name the tradeoffs and risks before implementing a direction; do not just agree. Reasoned disagreement is more useful than assent.
6. **Report the defects, not just the wins.** End a UI review with the findings list — each rated severity (Glaring/Untidy/Nitpick) and autonomy (Safe/Judgment) — what was fixed, and what remains. Honesty about what is still rough beats a clean-sounding summary.

## Before you finish: run the checks locally (they mirror CI)

Do not push and let CI find failures you could have caught. Before committing or reporting a change done, run the same gate the [CI workflow](.github/workflows/ci.yml) runs, from the repo root, and get each to pass:

```bash
pnpm lint        # eslint . (type-aware: parse, type, and a11y issues)
pnpm check:theme # undefined custom properties · 108 AA pairings/theme · design-system sync
pnpm check:version # the release version agrees across all nine places that carry it
pnpm typecheck   # tsc --noEmit
pnpm test        # fast Node unit + jsdom component lanes
pnpm test:integration # full-app and axe journeys (bounded two-worker lane)
pnpm test:stories # story tests headless in Chromium — run when components or stories changed
pnpm test:agent-benchmarks # frozen task, capability, and provider contracts
pnpm check:capabilities # capability pins still match the vendored okf skill
pnpm build       # tsc --noEmit && vite build
cargo fmt --all -- --check   # CI gates this before clippy; nothing else catches it
cargo clippy -p okf-core --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test -p okf-core
cargo clippy -p okf-viewer --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test -p okf-viewer --no-fail-fast
```

`pnpm lint` is the one that most often breaks on *new* files: a directory the root `tsconfig` does not cover, or an unignored config the type-aware parser cannot place. Run it after adding or moving files, not only after editing existing ones; if a new sub-project does not belong to the app's `tsconfig`, add it to `ignores` in `eslint.config.mjs`.

Separate sub-projects carry their own gate — see [the marketing-site section](#keep-the-marketing-site-in-sync-it-is-the-products-shop-window) for `site/` and the design system.

## Dogfood / test fixture

`docs/` is a real, conformant OKF bundle. Use it as the **primary test fixture**: a correct build, pointed at the repo root or at `docs/`, must detect this bundle and render the very spec it was built from. The OKF reference repo's sample bundles (GA4, Stack Overflow, Bitcoin) are good additional fixtures. For fast UI iteration, `pnpm dev` in a browser serves a mock bundle (`src/mock/fixture.ts`) — keep it exercising new reader features so they stay visually verifiable.

## Keep the `docs/` bundle in sync (it is an OKF v0.1 bundle)

When you add or change a feature, decision, or flow, update the bundle **in the same change** so the spec never drifts from the code:

- Every concept needs frontmatter with a non-empty `type` (the one hard OKF rule).
- Refresh the concept's `timestamp` on meaningful edits.
- Append a dated entry to [`docs/log.md`](docs/log.md) (newest first, `## YYYY-MM-DD`, lead with **Creation**/**Update**/**Deprecation**).
- Regenerate the affected `index.md` when you add, rename, remove, or re-describe a concept.
- Link related concepts with bundle-relative markdown links, naming the relationship in prose; keep one fact in one place.
- **Validate before finishing:** `node scripts/okf-validate.mjs docs` must report **0 errors** (warnings are advisory).

## Conventions

- **Rust owns the filesystem; the frontend owns rendering.** The webview gets no direct fs/network access — only [commands/events](docs/architecture/ipc-and-security.md).
- **Read-only folder opening and explicit external activity** (see [principles](docs/product/principles.md)). Opening an untrusted bundle must be safe. Agent processes and network requests start only from a named user action. Bundle writes require an explicit thread grant, staged revision, validation, review, and Apply.
- **Tolerant consumer:** never refuse a bundle for soft issues (missing fields, unknown `type`, broken links, missing `index.md`); surface them via [Validation](docs/features/validation.md) instead.
- **Capabilities stay least-privilege** (`src-tauri/capabilities/`): the webview receives typed commands rather than direct filesystem or provider access. Rust owns explicit updater, remote-bundle, source-fetch, installer, ACP, and configured-model network paths; adding another path requires a principle-level decision and a bounded user action.
