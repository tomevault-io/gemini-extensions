## Skill Loading Order

Agents load skills in dependency order. Core skills load first.

### Default Load Order (All Agents)
1. `modern-csharp` — Always loaded, baseline C# knowledge
2. Agent-specific skills (see agent files)

### Per-Agent Skill Maps

| Agent | Skills |
|-------|--------|
| dotnet-architect | modern-csharp, architecture-advisor, project-structure, scaffolding, project-setup + conditional: vertical-slice, clean-architecture, ddd |
| api-designer | modern-csharp, minimal-api, api-versioning, authentication, error-handling |
| ef-core-specialist | modern-csharp, ef-core, configuration, migration-workflow |
| test-engineer | modern-csharp, testing |
| security-auditor | modern-csharp, authentication, configuration |
| performance-analyst | modern-csharp, caching |
| devops-engineer | modern-csharp, docker, ci-cd, aspire |
| code-reviewer | modern-csharp, code-review-workflow, convention-learner + contextual (loads relevant skills incl. clean-architecture, ddd based on files under review) |
| build-error-resolver | modern-csharp, autonomous-loops + contextual: ef-core, dependency-injection |
| refactor-cleaner | modern-csharp, de-sloppify + contextual: testing, ef-core |

## MCP Tool Preferences

Agents should **prefer Roslyn MCP tools over file scanning** to reduce token consumption.

| Task | Use MCP Tool | Instead Of |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| Find where a type is defined | `find_symbol` | Grep/Glob across all .cs files |
| Find all usages of a type | `find_references` | Grep for the type name |
| Find implementations of an interface | `find_implementations` | Searching for `: IInterface` |
| Understand inheritance | `get_type_hierarchy` | Reading multiple files |
| Understand project dependencies | `get_project_graph` | Parsing .csproj files manually |
| Review a type's API surface | `get_public_api` | Reading the full source file |
| Check for compilation errors | `get_diagnostics` | Running `dotnet build` and parsing output |
| Find unused code for cleanup | `find_dead_code` | Manual inspection of all files |
| Check for circular dependencies | `detect_circular_dependencies` | Manually tracing project references |
| Understand method call chains | `get_dependency_graph` | Reading multiple files and tracing calls |
| Check which types have tests | `get_test_coverage_map` | Manually searching for test files |

## Cross-Agent Meta Skills

These 10 meta and productivity skills are not tied to a specific agent — any agent can load them when the context calls for it:

| Skill | When to Load |
|-------|-------------|
| `self-correction-loop` | After ANY user correction — capture the rule in MEMORY.md |
| `wrap-up-ritual` | User signals end of session — write handoff to `.claude/handoff.md` |
| `context-discipline` | Context running low, large codebase navigation, planning exploration strategy |
| `model-selection` | Choosing between Opus/Sonnet/Haiku, assigning subagent models |
| `80-20-review` | Code review, PR review, deciding what to review in depth |
| `split-memory` | CLAUDE.md exceeds 300 lines, need to split instructions across files |
| `learning-log` | Non-obvious discovery during development — log the insight |
| `instinct-system` | Pattern detection across sessions — observe-hypothesize-confirm cycle for project conventions |
| `session-management` | Session start/end — load handoff, detect solution, write session summary |
| `autonomous-loops` | Iterative fix loops — build-fix, test-fix, refactor with bounded iterations |

### Meta Skill Routing

| User Intent Pattern | Skill |
|---|---|
| "learn from mistakes", "remember this", "don't do that again" | self-correction-loop |
| "wrap up", "done for today", "save progress", "handoff" | wrap-up-ritual |
| "context", "running out of tokens", "too many files" | context-discipline |
| "which model", "use Opus", "use Sonnet", "switch model" | model-selection |
| "review this", "what should I review", "blast radius" | 80-20-review |
| "split CLAUDE.md", "too long", "organize instructions" | split-memory |
| "log this", "document this finding", "gotcha" | learning-log |
| "show instincts", "what have you learned", "confidence scores" | instinct-system |
| "start session", "load handoff", "session start" | session-management |
| "fix build loop", "keep fixing", "auto-fix" | autonomous-loops |

## Slash Commands

Commands map to skills and agents. Use these as shortcuts for common workflows.

| Command | Primary Skill | Primary Agent | Purpose |
|---------|--------------|---------------|---------|
| `/dotnet-init` | project-setup | dotnet-architect | Interactive project initialization |
| `/plan` | architecture-advisor | dotnet-architect | Architecture-aware planning |
| `/verify` | verification-loop | — | 7-phase verification pipeline |
| `/tdd` | testing | test-engineer | Red-green-refactor workflow |
| `/scaffold` | scaffolding | dotnet-architect | Architecture-aware feature scaffolding |
| `/code-review` | code-review-workflow | code-reviewer | MCP-powered code review |
| `/build-fix` | autonomous-loops | build-error-resolver | Iterative build error fixing |
| `/checkpoint` | wrap-up-ritual | — | Save progress (commit + handoff) |
| `/security-scan` | security-scan | security-auditor | OWASP + secrets + dependency audit |
| `/migrate` | migration-workflow | ef-core-specialist | Safe EF Core migration workflow |
| `/health-check` | health-check | code-reviewer | Graded project health report |
| `/de-sloppify` | de-sloppify | refactor-cleaner | Systematic code cleanup |
| `/wrap-up` | wrap-up-ritual | — | Session ending ritual |
| `/instinct-status` | instinct-system | — | Show learned instincts |
| `/instinct-export` | instinct-system | — | Export instincts to shareable format |
| `/instinct-import` | instinct-system | — | Import instincts from another project |

## Conflict Resolution

When two agents could handle a query:

1. **Architecture questions win over implementation** — "How should I structure the payment module?" → dotnet-architect, even though api-designer could handle the endpoint part
2. **Specific beats general** — "How do I optimize this EF query?" → ef-core-specialist, not performance-analyst
3. **Security concerns are always surfaced** — Even when another agent is primary, flag security issues for the security-auditor
4. **Code review is holistic** — The code-reviewer loads skills contextually based on what's in the PR

## Token Budget Guidance

For detailed context management strategies, see the **`context-discipline`** skill.

- **Small queries** (single pattern/fix): Load 1-2 skills, use MCP tools for context
- **Medium queries** (feature implementation): Load 3-4 skills, use MCP tools to understand existing code
- **Large queries** (architecture review): Load all relevant skills, use `get_project_graph` first to understand the solution shape

## Response Patterns

All agents should:
1. **Start with the recommended approach** — Don't enumerate all options equally
2. **Show code first, explain after** — Developers prefer seeing the solution, then understanding why
3. **Flag anti-patterns proactively** — If the user's existing code has issues, mention them
4. **Reference skills** — Point to relevant skills for deeper reading
5. **Use MCP tools before reading files** — Reduce token consumption
