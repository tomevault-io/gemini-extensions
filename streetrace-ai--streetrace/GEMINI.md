# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

StreetRace🚗💨 is an agentic AI coding partner designed to help engineers leverage AI capabilities directly from the command line. It serves as a bridge between AI language models and project resources, enabling AI to take actions on various tasks, with the main focus being Developer Experience and Productivity, Software Delivery, and DevOps.

## Common Development Commands

### Environment Setup

- **Install dependencies**: `poetry install`
- **Run StreetRace**: `poetry run streetrace --model=$YOUR_FAVORITE_MODEL`

### Development Workflow

- **Run tests**: `poetry run pytest tests -vv --no-header --timeout=5 -q` or `make test`
- **Run single test**: `poetry run pytest tests/path/to/test_file.py::test_function_name -v`
- **Lint code**: `poetry run ruff check src tests --ignore=FIX002` or `make lint`
- **Type checking**: `poetry run mypy src` or `make typed`
- **Security scan**: `poetry run bandit -r src` or `make security`
- **Check dependencies**: `poetry run deptry src tests` or `make depcheck`
- **Find unused code**: `poetry run vulture src vulture_allow.txt` or `make unusedcode`
- **Run all checks**: `make check` (runs test, lint, typed, security, depcheck, unusedcode)

**vulture_allow.txt policy**: Entries in `vulture_allow.txt` may ONLY be added for structurally rational reasons where code is genuinely used but vulture cannot detect it (e.g., Lark transformer methods called by name, Pydantic validators, dynamically dispatched functions, dataclass fields, public API surface). NEVER add entries to suppress warnings about actually dead code - instead, delete the dead code. Each entry MUST include a comment explaining why the code appears unused to vulture but is actually reachable.

**Important**: Run `make check` frequently during development and address all reported issues immediately before committing.

### Coverage and Profiling

- **Generate coverage report**: `make coverage`
- **Profile startup**: `poetry run python scripts/profile_startup.py`
- **Compare profiles**: `poetry run python scripts/compare_profiles.py`

## Architecture Overview

StreetRace follows a modular, layered architecture with clear separation of concerns:

### Core Components

**Workflow Layer (`workflow/supervisor.py`)**

- Orchestrates interaction loop between users and AI agents
- Manages ADK sessions and conversation persistence
- Handles tool integration and event processing

**Agent Management (`agents/agent_manager.py`)**

- Discovers, validates, and creates specialized AI agents
- Supports both modern StreetRaceAgent interface and legacy function-based agents
- Manages agent lifecycle with proper dependency injection

**LLM Integration (`llm/`)**

- `model_factory.py`: Factory for creating and caching language model instances
- `llm_interface.py`: Abstraction layer for various LLM providers
- `lite_llm_client.py`: Resilient client with retry logic and cost tracking

**UI Layer (`ui/`)**

- `console_ui.py`: Terminal-based interface with rich text and interactive prompts
- `ui_bus.py`: Event-driven communication system using pub/sub pattern
- `completer.py`: Intelligent auto-completion for files and commands

**Tool System (`tools/`)**

- `tool_provider.py`: Centralizes tool discovery and MCP integration
- `fs_tool.py`: Safe file system operations within working directory
- `cli_tool.py` + `cli_safety.py`: Controlled CLI command execution with security analysis
- `agent_tools.py`: Agent discovery and management tools

### Key Patterns

- **Dependency Injection**: Used throughout for testability and modularity
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: UI components communicate via UiBus events
- **Factory Pattern**: For model and agent creation
- **Command Pattern**: For internal commands (`commands/command_executor.py`)
- **Security by Design**: CLI safety analysis prevents dangerous operations

## Code Style Guidelines

When implementing code, produce a clean final implementation that is ready for testing
and production.

### Python Standards

- NEVER use the word Legacy.
- Use type annotations for all functions
- Provide docstrings for public symbols
- Use imperative mood for the first line of docstrings.
- Use absolute imports (`from streetrace... import ...`)
- Use double quotes for strings
- Keep functions under McCabe complexity 10
- Use module-level logger: `streetrace.log.get_logger(__name__)`
- When logging, ensure deferred formatting by passing values as arguments to the logging
  method.
- Use logging.exception when logging exceptions.
- Introduce descriptive constants instead of magic values in comparisons and document
  constants using a docstring.
- Use a single `with` statement with multiple contexts instead of nested `with`
  statements.
- Keep newline at end of file.
- Always run `ruff` on the changed files.
- When raising exceptions, assign the message to a variable first.
- Create small clearly isolated and testable modules with dependency injection.
- Avoid boolean positional arguments in method definitions - use keyword-only arguments or enums instead.

### Common Ruff Errors to Avoid

**W293 - Blank line contains whitespace**

- Remove all spaces/tabs from blank lines in docstrings and code
- Use completely empty lines (no whitespace characters)
- Example:

  ```python
  def func():
      """Function description.

      Args:  # <- This line should be completely empty above
          param: Description
      """
  ```

**E501 - Line too long (exceeds 88 characters)**

- Break long lines at logical points (function parameters, operators)
- Use parentheses for implicit line continuation
- Example:

  ```python
  # Bad
  msg = "This is a very long error message that exceeds the line length limit"

  # Good
  msg = (
      "This is a very long error message that has been broken "
      "into multiple lines for readability"
  )
  ```

**ANN401 - Dynamically typed expressions (typing.Any)**

- Avoid `Any` type annotations; use specific types instead
- For Pydantic validators, use `object` or specific union types
- Example:

  ```python
  # Bad
  def validator(cls, v: Any) -> Any:

  # Good
  def validator(cls, v: object) -> str | dict[str, str]:
  ```

**ANN001 - Missing type annotation**

- Always provide type annotations for function parameters
- Use appropriate types from `typing` module when needed
- Example:

  ```python
  # Bad
  def process_tool(self, tool_spec) -> AnyTool:

  # Good
  def process_tool(self, tool_spec: ToolSpec) -> AnyTool:
  ```

**BLE001 - Do not catch blind exception**

- Catch specific exception types instead of bare `except Exception:`
- Use specific exceptions that are actually expected
- Example:

  ```python
  # Bad
  try:
      risky_operation()
  except Exception:
      handle_error()

  # Good
  try:
      risky_operation()
  except (ValueError, ImportError) as e:
      handle_specific_error(e)
  ```

**UP007 - Use X | Y for type annotations**

- Use modern union syntax `X | Y` instead of `Union[X, Y]`
- Available in Python 3.10+, which this project uses
- Example:

  ```python
  # Bad
  from typing import Union
  ServerConfig = Union[StdioServerConfig, HttpServerConfig]

  # Good
  ServerConfig = StdioServerConfig | HttpServerConfig
  ```

**SIM117 - Use a single `with` statement with multiple contexts instead of nested `with` statements**

- Combine multiple context managers into a single `with` statement using parentheses
- This includes combining `patch.object()` calls and `pytest.raises()` in tests
- Example:

  ```python
  # Bad
  with patch.object(obj, "method1"):
      with patch.object(obj, "method2"):
          with pytest.raises(ValueError):
              # test code
              pass

  # Good
  with (
      patch.object(obj, "method1"),
      patch.object(obj, "method2"),
      pytest.raises(ValueError),
  ):
      # test code
      pass
  ```

**ARG002 - Unused method argument**

- Remove unused parameters from function/method signatures
- In tests, only include fixture parameters that are actually used
- Example:

  ```python
  # Bad
  def test_something(self, used_fixture, unused_fixture):
      assert used_fixture.value == "expected"

  # Good
  def test_something(self, used_fixture):
      assert used_fixture.value == "expected"
  ```

### Naming Conventions

- **Avoid generic adjectives**: Don't use words like "Enhanced", "Advanced", "Improved" in class, method, and variable names
- **Use function-focused names**: Name things based on what they do, not how "good" they are
- **Examples**:
  - ❌ `EnhancedMCPTransport`, `ReliableMCPTransport` → ✅ `MCPTransport` or `RetryingMCPTransport`
  - ❌ `AdvancedAgentLoader` → ✅ `AgentLoader` or `RecursiveAgentLoader`
  - ❌ `enhanced_validation()` → ✅ `validate_schema()` or `strict_validate_schema()`

### Error Handling Strategy

- **UI Layer**: Be tolerant - log errors, show fallbacks, never crash
- **Core/Internal**: Be fail-fast - assert assumptions, crash on invalid state
- **Natural Language Parsing**: Be selectively tolerant - enforce critical fields
- **Third-Party APIs**: Balance carefully - fail-fast for reliable APIs, tolerate loose schemas
- **No implicit fallbacks**: Never silently degrade behavior. If it works, it works as expected; otherwise it fails loudly and reports the root cause clearly. Logging, telemetry, or UI messages alone do **not** constitute valid error handling — they are silent degradation unless they block execution and wait for user confirmation. The only valid degradation is to fail with a clear error. If a feature requires a dependency (e.g. Presidio for PII masking), either install it at runtime or raise with clear instructions — never silently fall back to a weaker implementation. Only support explicit, configuration-level fallbacks where the user makes a conscious choice.

### Testing

- Use pytest with existing fixtures in `conftest.py` files
- Break up tests by user scenarios
- Achieve >95% coverage by addressing largest gaps
- Use `assert` statements, not unittest methods
- Add `# noqa: SLF001` when accessing private members in tests

```

## Development Environment

**Recommended**: Use VS Code Dev Container for enhanced terminal with persistent bash history, autocompletion, and command shortcuts like `gs` (git status), `pi` (poetry install), `check` (make check).

## Key Integration Points

- **MCP Protocol**: External tool servers via `tools/mcp_transport.py`
- **ADK Framework**: Google's Agent Development Kit for agent execution
- **LiteLLM**: Standardized access to multiple LLM providers
- **Rich/Prompt-toolkit**: Terminal UI with formatting and completion

## Performance Considerations

- Startup performance is continuously monitored via GitHub Actions
- LLM interfaces include token estimation and cost tracking
- Tool operations respect .gitignore for efficient file discovery
- Session persistence enables context continuity across runs

# important-instruction-reminders

Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.
ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
NEVER proactively create documentation files (\*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.
In design docs and other technical docs, never add full implementation of code. When a code example is necessary, only provide a snippet reflecting the main point.
