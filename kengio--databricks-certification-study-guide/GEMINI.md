Each certification folder contains numbered topic folders (`01-topic/`, `02-topic/`, …) with a `README.md` index and individual `.md` topic files. Each also has `resources/` with `exam-tips.md`, `official-links.md`, `practice-questions/`, `mock-exam/`, and `mock-exam-2/`.

## Translations

- **English** is the canonical source. All content edits land in English first.
- **Thai** is the only in-tree translation, at `i18n/th/`. The maintainer reads Thai and reviews Thai PRs.
- **Other languages** use the fork model — community forks register themselves in `i18n/README.md`. We don't merge non-Thai translations into upstream.
- Translation policy is in `TRANSLATING.md`; the Thai glossary is `i18n/th/glossary.md`. Thai translations must conform to the glossary.
- Product names (Delta Lake, Unity Catalog, Lakeflow Jobs, MLflow, etc.) and code blocks stay in English in all translations.
- When English content changes that has a Thai counterpart, mark the Thai file 🔄 in `i18n/th/STATUS.md` until re-synced.

## Content Guidelines

### Content Placement

- **Check `shared/` first** — if content applies to multiple certifications, put it there
- **Reference, don't duplicate** shared content across certifications

### Code Examples

- **Always `.md` files**, never `.py` or `.sql` — store in `shared/code-examples/python/` or `sql/`
- Fenced code blocks with language tags; group related snippets under `##` headings; add YAML frontmatter with `tags`

### File Size

- **Target: 300–600 lines**; hard limit: ~800 lines (~20–25 KB)
- **Exception:** `mock-exam/questions.md` files — do not split
- **Split** when 2+ distinct sub-topics can stand alone → `03-topic-part1.md` + `03-topic-part2.md`:
  1. Same number prefix; append `-part1` / `-part2`
  2. Each part gets own YAML frontmatter and intro
  3. Terminal sections (Use Cases → Official Docs) go in **Part 2 only**; Part 1 ends with forward link
  4. Update topic `README.md` index; delete original; fix all links repo-wide

### Markdown Conventions

- Run markdownlint on every modified file; blank lines before/after headings (MD022)
- Language tags on all code blocks (`sql`, `python`, `scala`)
- **One `#` H1 per file (the title).** Exception: the top-level `README.md` uses a centered `<h1 align="center">` HTML block instead of a markdown `#` to render the banner — this is intentional; do not "fix" it
- **Callout type names are lowercase**: `> [!note]`, `> [!important]`, `> [!warning]`, `> [!tip]`, `> [!success]-`, `> [!abstract]`, `> [!info]`
- **Topic-file preamble callouts** (after the `## Overview`): two standard callouts in this order:
  1. `> [!abstract]` — 2–4 bullets summarising the topic's key concepts (the "what")
  2. `> [!tip] What the Exam Tests` — 2–4 bullets framing what an exam taker should learn from the topic (the "why study this")

  These are *preamble* / orientation callouts. The terminal `## Exam Tips` section (between Common Issues & Errors and Key Takeaways) is for *cram-style* advice consumed right before the exam, and serves a distinct purpose.
- **Use a non-breaking space before `%`** in weights and percentages (e.g., `24 %`, not `24%`) for visual consistency across cert READMEs
- **Multi-line Python:** parenthesized expressions, not backslash continuations:

  ```python
  df = (spark.read.format("delta")
      .option("key", "value")
      .load("/path"))
  ```

- **Practice answers:** Obsidian foldable `> [!success]- Answer` callout
- **Practice choices:** A/B/C/D on separate lines (no bullets); two trailing spaces for line breaks

### Diagrams & Images

- **Architecture diagrams:** Mermaid (`flowchart`, `sequenceDiagram`, `graph`)
- **Directory trees:** ASCII text, not Mermaid
- **Screenshots:** `images/databricks-ui/<feature>/`; standard markdown `![Alt](path)` with caption; ≤800 px wide

### Links

- **Link to files, not folders** (`path/to/README.md`, not `path/to/`)
- **Always `./README.md`** for local READMEs — bare `README.md` resolves ambiguously in Obsidian
- Verify target files exist after edits

### Section Ordering (End of Topic Files)

Terminal sections in this exact order:

1. `## Use Cases`
2. `## Common Issues & Errors`
3. `## Best Practices` *(optional)*
4. `## Exam Tips`
5. `## Key Takeaways`
6. `## Related Topics`
7. `## Official Documentation`
8. `---` separator + navigation link (always last)

**Lab files** (`type: lab` under `labs/`) are exercises, not topic files. They follow a different terminal pattern: `## Verification` (or fold verification into the last numbered step) → `## Cleanup` → `## Related Study Material` → `---` + nav. The Use Cases / Common Issues / Exam Tips / Key Takeaways sections do not apply.

**Final-review files** (`type: final-review` under each cert's `resources/final-review.md`) are exam-morning cram scans, also not topic files. Standard structure: a `> [!important]` framing callout (optional), `## 2-minute facts ...`, `## 5-minute per-domain quick-fire`, `## Common-trap reminders` (table), `## Today's exam — <N>-minute time budget`, optional motivational close, `---` + nav. No Use Cases / Common Issues / Key Takeaways terminal sections — the whole file IS the cram material.

**Nav format:** end each topic file with a three-segment bold line — Previous file link, Back-to-Section link to `./README.md`, Next file link — separated by ` | `. Schematic (replace `<prev>` and `<next>` with the actual sibling filenames):

```text
**[← Previous: <Prev Topic>](<prev>.md) | [↑ Back to Section](README.md) | [Next: <Next Topic> →](<next>.md)**
```

- Part 1 files: end with only forward link to Part 2
- Part 2 files: full three-way nav

## PR Workflow

This repo uses a **3-round self-review** before squash-merge. Full process in [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

| Round | Focus |
| :---: | :--- |
| **1** | Technical correctness — links resolve, code runs, markdownlint passes |
| **2** | Factual / blueprint accuracy — every change cites a Databricks source |
| **3** | Style & conventions — terminal sections, callouts, A/B/C/D formatting |

- Branch off `main` with a descriptive name (`fix/`, `feat/`, `docs/`, `chore/`)
- Commit prefixes: `docs:`, `fix:`, `feat:`, `chore:`, `review(roundN):` for review passes
- **Squash-merge only.** Merge commits and rebase merges are disabled at the repo level
- Branch protection: linear history required, force pushes and deletions blocked

## README & CLAUDE.md Sync Rule

Every PR that changes content **must** keep `README.md` and `CLAUDE.md` in sync.

| If the PR… | …also update |
| :--- | :--- |
| Adds a new certification | top-level `README.md` (certs table, exam-at-a-glance), `CLAUDE.md` (Repository Structure, Certification Topic Folders) |
| Renames or restructures a topic folder | `CLAUDE.md` (Certification Topic Folders), the cert's `README.md` (Study Topics table) |
| Adds a new cheat sheet, interview-prep file, fundamental, code example, or appendix entry | `CLAUDE.md` (Shared Content) |
| Changes domain weights, fee, duration, or question count | top-level `README.md` (per-cert exam-at-a-glance) AND the cert's `README.md` |
| Bumps the exam-guide version date for a cert | top-level `README.md` (table + "What changed" callout), `CHANGELOG.md`, the cert's `README.md` |
| Touches a convention or layout rule | `CLAUDE.md` (Content Guidelines) |
| Edits an English file that has a Thai counterpart under `i18n/th/` | mark the counterpart 🔄 in `i18n/th/STATUS.md` (don't translate in the same PR — Thai catch-up is a separate PR) |
| Adds a new Databricks-adjacent term to a Thai translation | also add it to `i18n/th/glossary.md` in the same PR |
| Adds or modifies an Anki deck under `anki/decks/` | update the "Available decks" table in `anki/README.md`; run `python3 anki/build.py --check` before committing |
| Edits a `certifications/<cert>/resources/practice-questions/*.md` file | re-run `python3 practice/build.py --cert <cert>` and commit the regenerated `practice/data/<cert>.json` in the same PR |
| Adds a new cert to the practice quiz | run `python3 practice/build.py`, update the "Available banks" table in `practice/README.md`, and add the cert to `KNOWN_BANKS` in `practice/app.js` |

The PR template checkbox enforces this. Do not check the box unless the update is actually in the diff.

## Currency Policy

When Databricks updates the exam guide for any certification:

1. Update the exam-guide version date in the cert's `README.md` Exam Overview table
2. Update any changed domain weights (Mermaid pie + Study Topics table)
3. Update / add the "What changed in the latest blueprint" callout at the top of that cert's `README.md`
4. Update the matching cert row in the top-level `README.md` certifications table and the "What changed in the 2025–2026 exam guides" section
5. Add an entry to [`CHANGELOG.md`](./CHANGELOG.md) describing the refresh
6. Mark new practice questions targeting the updated skills with a `*(YYYY blueprint)*` suffix in the question heading

Always cite the new exam-guide PDF URL in the PR description.
