# Quarkus Testing Skill

Conventions for tests that involve Quarkus — `@QuarkusTest`, the integration-test companion pattern, REST
Assured idioms, and CDI bean mocking. The goal: tests that are fast, deterministic, and unambiguous about what
they're actually exercising.

**Foundational principle.** If you mock the system under test, you're not testing — you're scaffolding. A test class named `XTest` that mocks `X` asserts only what Mockito returned; the rules inside `X` go untested. Mock *collaborators* (other application services, external clients) — never the class the test is named after, never aggregates, never value objects. "We'll test the rules in pure JUnit later" + a `pure-JUnit` file that doesn't exist = the rules go untested forever.

**Red Flags — STOP if you find yourself thinking:**

- About to mock the class your `*Test` class is named after.
- About to mock a domain type (aggregate, value object, entity).
- About to use both `@InjectMock` and `QuarkusMock.installMockForType` for the same bean.
- "We'll write the actual rule tests in pure JUnit later" — and that pure-JUnit file does not exist yet.
- "The `@QuarkusTest` just verifies wiring" — when the test class is named after the rules class.
- Endpoint path in the test doesn't match the resource's `@Path` declaration.

If any of these surface, re-read Core Rules and Excuse / Reality before typing.

---

## When to Use

- Writing or editing a test class annotated with `@QuarkusTest` or `@QuarkusIntegrationTest`.
- Naming a new IT class — use the `*IT extends *Test` companion pattern.
- Deciding whether to use `@InjectMock`, `QuarkusMock.installMockForType`, or `QuarkusMock.installMockForInstance`.
- Mocking a CDI bean (application service, repository).
- Hitting an endpoint with REST Assured.
- Reviewing a test that mocks a `Service` and names the variable `mockRepository`, or that uses both
  `@InjectMock` and `QuarkusMock.installMockForType` for the same bean.

**Out of scope**: pure-JVM aggregate / value-object tests (no Quarkus, just JUnit + assertions — those are
plain unit tests), end-to-end tests against a deployed environment, performance tests.

---

## Core Rules

1. **Use `@QuarkusTest` for JVM tests, `@QuarkusIntegrationTest` for packaged-mode tests.** Quarkus boots once
   per test profile; tests share the same CDI container.
2. **Use the companion pattern for integration tests:** `class FooIT extends FooTest {}`. The IT class adds
   `@QuarkusIntegrationTest` and inherits every test method, so the same suite runs against both the JVM build
   and the packaged artifact. Match this everywhere.
3. **`@InjectMock` is always the default.** Declare `@InjectMock OrderService orders;` and stub in `@BeforeEach`
   with `Mockito.when(...)`. The mock is class-scoped and visible to every test method. Always start here.
   Escalate to `QuarkusMock.installMockForType` only for the specific cases in Rule 4.
4. **Use `QuarkusMock.installMockForType` only for these three cases.** It replaces the bean globally for the
   test's duration; reach for it when `@InjectMock` can't do the job.
   - **(a) Programmatic control.** You need to construct the mock or fake yourself in a setup method — typically
     a hand-rolled stateful fake (a real class, not a Mockito-generated mock) whose construction or wiring is
     too complex for field injection. Install in `@BeforeAll` for the class lifetime, or `@BeforeEach` per test.
     For a non-static `@BeforeAll` method, the test class needs `@TestInstance(Lifecycle.PER_CLASS)`.
   - **(b) Normal-scoped bean replacement.** The bean is `@ApplicationScoped` or `@RequestScoped` and the mock
     must be visible to *other* beans that inject the same type — not just to the field in your test class.
     `installMockForType` swaps the delegate globally so every injection point sees the mock.
   - **(c) Dynamic mocking within a test.** You need to change the mock implementation mid-execution.
     Pair with `QuarkusMock.installMockForInstance` (Rule 5).
5. **`QuarkusMock.installMockForInstance` is only used in conjunction with `installMockForType`.** When an
   individual test method needs to override the already-installed type mock, build a per-test mock and call
   `QuarkusMock.installMockForInstance(perTestMock, installedDefault)`. The override applies for the duration
   of that test method only. Don't use `installMockForInstance` standalone — it overrides nothing if no type
   mock is registered.
6. **`QuarkusMock` is incompatible with parallel test execution.** Both `installMockForType` and
   `installMockForInstance` replace beans globally for the test's duration, which causes race conditions when
   tests run in parallel. If the project enables JUnit parallelism (`junit.jupiter.execution.parallel.enabled`),
   stick to `@InjectMock` for these tests.
7. **Never declare the same bean with both `@InjectMock` and `QuarkusMock.installMockForType`.** That's the
   cargo-cult pattern: two mechanisms install the same mock, one always wins, the other is dead code that
   misleads readers. Pick the right mechanism per Rules 3-4 and use only that one. (This rule does *not*
   forbid the legitimate `installMockForType` + `installMockForInstance` pairing from Rule 5, where the two
   work together by design.)
8. **Don't mock domain types.** Aggregates, value objects, and entities should be exercised with real instances
   — that's what makes the test useful. Mock only collaborators (other application services, external clients).
9. **Use REST Assured for HTTP assertions.** `given().when().get(...).then().statusCode(...).body(...)`.
   Assert on status code, then on body shape. Hamcrest matchers (`is`, `equalTo`, `hasSize`) for body content.
10. **Don't test the framework.** Don't write a test that asserts Hibernate persists a field, Jackson serializes
    a record, or Quarkus injects a bean. Test *your* logic.
11. **Know whether the project skips integration tests by default.** Many Maven Quarkus projects set
    `<skipITs>true</skipITs>`, so `./mvnw verify` runs only unit tests; ITs run with `-DskipITs=false` or
    under the `native` profile. Check `pom.xml` before assuming.
12. **Endpoint paths in tests must match `@Path` on the resource.** If a test hits `/api/orders` and the
    resource is `@Path("/orders")`, the test is wrong — fix the test, not the resource. Match what the resource
    actually declares.

## Canonical Examples

### REST resource test with `@InjectMock`

```java
package com.example.orders.interfaces.rest;

import com.example.orders.application.OrderApplicationService;
import com.example.orders.application.OrderDTO;
import io.quarkus.test.InjectMock;
import io.quarkus.test.junit.QuarkusTest;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeEach;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.mockito.Mockito;

import java.util.List;
import java.util.Optional;

import static io.restassured.RestAssured.given;
import static org.hamcrest.Matchers.*;

@QuarkusTest
class OrdersResourceTest {

    @InjectMock
    OrderApplicationService orders;

    @BeforeEach
    void setUp() {
        Mockito.when(orders.findAll()).thenReturn(List.of(
            new OrderDTO(1L, "first", 9.99),
            new OrderDTO(2L, "second", 19.99)
        ));
        Mockito.when(orders.findById(1L)).thenReturn(Optional.of(new OrderDTO(1L, "first", 9.99)));
        Mockito.when(orders.findById(99L)).thenReturn(Optional.empty());
    }

    @Test
    void listOrdersReturnsAll() {
        given()
            .when().get("/orders")
            .then()
                .statusCode(200)
                .body("size()", is(2));
    }

    @Test
    void getOrderReturnsBodyWhenFound() {
        given()
            .when().get("/orders/1")
            .then()
                .statusCode(200)
                .body("id", equalTo(1));
    }

    @Test
    void getOrderReturns404WhenMissing() {
        given()
            .when().get("/orders/99")
            .then()
                .statusCode(404);
    }
}
```

### Integration-test companion

```java
package com.example.orders.interfaces.rest;

import io.quarkus.test.junit.QuarkusIntegrationTest;

@QuarkusIntegrationTest
class OrdersResourceIT extends OrdersResourceTest {
    // Same tests, run against the packaged artifact in `target/`.
}
```

### Repository test against Dev Services PostgreSQL

```java
package com.example.orders.infrastructure;

import com.example.orders.domain.Money;
import com.example.orders.domain.Order;
import io.quarkus.test.TestTransaction;
import io.quarkus.test.junit.QuarkusTest;
import jakarta.inject.Inject;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

import java.math.BigDecimal;
import java.util.Currency;
import java.util.UUID;

import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;

@QuarkusTest
class OrderRepositoryTest {

    @Inject OrderRepository orders;

    @Test
    @TestTransaction
    void persistsAndFindsById() {
        UUID id = UUID.randomUUID();
        Order order = Order.place(id, new Money(new BigDecimal("9.99"), Currency.getInstance("USD")));
        orders.persist(order);

        Order found = orders.findById(id).orElseThrow();
        assertEquals(id, found.id);
        assertEquals(0L, found.version);
    }
}
```

`@TestTransaction` rolls back at the end of each test, keeping the database clean between tests.

### Dynamic mocking pattern — `installMockForType` + `installMockForInstance`

**Before reaching for this pattern, confirm `@InjectMock` doesn't fit.** This pattern is **not** for the common case of "method behaves differently depending on argument." If your tests need

```java
Mockito.doNothing().when(orders).cancel(1L);
Mockito.doThrow(new OrderNotFoundException(99L)).when(orders).cancel(99L);
Mockito.doThrow(new OrderAlreadyFulfilledException(2L)).when(orders).cancel(2L);
```

— that's **per-call stubbing by argument**, which `@InjectMock` + `Mockito.when(...)` in `@BeforeEach` already handles cleanly. Per Rule 3, that is the default. Mockito differentiates by argument matcher; you do not need to swap the instance.

`installMockForInstance` is for the rarer case where the test needs the **entire bean instance replaced** with one of fundamentally different behavior — typically a different fake implementation, a clock fixed to a different time, a feature-flag client configured with a different flag set, etc. The discriminator is *the whole object*, not *which arguments it was called with*.

**Caveat (Rule 6):** This pattern is incompatible with parallel test execution. If the project runs tests in parallel, fall back to `@InjectMock`.

The canonical legitimate case: a `Clock` bean fixed to one time by default, swapped to a different time for one test that exercises an expiry path. There is no method-stubbing by argument — both instances are real `Clock` objects with all-different behavior end-to-end.

```java
package com.example.orders.interfaces.rest;

import io.quarkus.test.junit.QuarkusMock;
import io.quarkus.test.junit.QuarkusTest;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeAll;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

import java.time.Clock;
import java.time.Instant;
import java.time.ZoneOffset;

import static io.restassured.RestAssured.given;

@QuarkusTest
class OrderExpiryResourceTest {

    static Clock defaultClock;

    @BeforeAll
    static void installDefault() {
        defaultClock = Clock.fixed(Instant.parse("2026-05-08T10:00:00Z"), ZoneOffset.UTC);
        QuarkusMock.installMockForType(defaultClock, Clock.class);
    }

    @Test
    void orderIsActiveAtDefaultTime() {
        given().when().get("/orders/1").then().statusCode(200);
    }

    @Test
    void orderHasExpiredOneYearLater() {
        Clock yearLater = Clock.fixed(Instant.parse("2027-05-08T10:00:00Z"), ZoneOffset.UTC);
        QuarkusMock.installMockForInstance(yearLater, defaultClock);

        given().when().get("/orders/1").then().statusCode(410);
    }
}
```

Key points:

- The default instance is held as a `static` field so per-test methods can pass it to `installMockForInstance` as the existing instance to replace.
- `installMockForInstance(newInstance, existingInstance)` swaps the registered bean for the duration of the test method only.
- Both `defaultClock` and `yearLater` are *complete* `Clock` instances. Nothing is stubbed per-call. That's the shape that genuinely requires this pattern.
- If you find yourself writing `Mockito.when(...)` or `Mockito.doThrow(...)` inside the per-test mock, stop and ask whether `@InjectMock` would do the job. Almost always: yes.

What these examples demonstrate:

- `@InjectMock OrderApplicationService` is a single source of truth for the mock; no `QuarkusMock.installMockForType` line.
- The mocked variable name matches the type being mocked (`orders`, not `mockRepository`).
- REST Assured asserts on status first, body second.
- IT companion is a one-liner — the value is in the inheritance, not the override.
- Repository test uses real Dev Services Postgres + `@TestTransaction` for isolation.
- Endpoint paths in tests match the resource's `@Path`.

## Anti-patterns

| Don't | Why it's wrong | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `@InjectMock OrderService orderService;` *and* `QuarkusMock.installMockForType(mock, OrderService.class)` for the same bean | Two ways of installing the same mock; one always wins, the other is dead code that misleads readers. | Pick `@InjectMock` and stub in `@BeforeEach`. Drop the `installMockForType` call. |
| Per-test `installMockForInstance` to vary return values by argument (`cancel(1L)` succeeds, `cancel(99L)` throws, `cancel(2L)` throws something else) | That's per-call stubbing, which `@InjectMock` + `Mockito.when(...).thenReturn/thenThrow` in `@BeforeEach` already does. `installMockForInstance` is for replacing the *whole bean instance*, not for varying responses per argument. | Use `@InjectMock` and stub each argument case in `@BeforeEach`. Reserve `installMockForInstance` for genuine wholesale-instance swap (e.g. a `Clock` fixed to a different time, a fake configured with different state at construction). |
| `OrderService mockOrderRepository = Mockito.mock(OrderService.class)` | Mixing "Service" and "Repository" in the variable name is exactly the layer confusion the type system is supposed to prevent. | Match the variable name to the type: `OrderService orders = Mockito.mock(OrderService.class)`. |
| Mocking `Order` (an aggregate) | The aggregate's invariants are the thing under test. Mocking it bypasses the invariants. | Use a real `Order` instance built with its factory method. Mock only the repository or external client. |
| Test hits `/api/orders` while the resource is `@Path("/orders")` | The test asserts a route that doesn't exist; failure is not informative. | Fix the test to match what the resource's `@Path` actually declares. |
| `@QuarkusTest` test that asserts `entityManager.persist(...)` updates a field | Tests Hibernate, not your code. | Test the behaviour your service exposes — not the ORM's correctness. |
| Integration test class without the companion `extends` | Duplicates every test method, drifts over time. | `class FooIT extends FooTest {}`. |
| Test that creates a real PostgreSQL container manually with `@Testcontainers` while Dev Services is enabled | Two databases compete; flaky and slow. | Let Dev Services manage it. Disable Dev Services explicitly only if you must. |
| Asserting on `body(is("..."))` for JSON | Compares whole-body strings; brittle to whitespace and field order. | Assert on JSON paths: `.body("size()", is(2))`, `.body("id", equalTo(1))`. |

## Excuse / Reality

When you catch yourself reasoning around the rules above, look here before you type. The left column is verbatim — what you'll actually say in your head or in Slack. The right column is what defeats it.

| Excuse | Reality |
|---|---|
| "A senior reviewer told me to use both `@InjectMock` and `QuarkusMock.installMockForType` — that's authority." | Cargo-culted defenses against unspecified races aren't authority, they're folklore. If a CDI race exists, name it and file a bug. Otherwise, follow the rule. One source of truth per mock. |
| "Belt-and-braces never hurts — install the mock both ways to be safe." | They install the same mock through different mechanisms. One always wins; the other is dead code. The next test author has to figure out which path is live, and tests are read more than they're written. |
| "The dynamic-mocking example shows three test methods with different `cancel(...)` behaviors, so my three-`cancel`-cases scenario fits this pattern." | The example demonstrates **wholesale instance replacement** (different `Clock` instance, different state-bearing fake) — not per-argument stubbing. "Different return / throw values per argument call" is exactly what `@InjectMock` + `Mockito.when(...)` in `@BeforeEach` is for. If your per-test override is a `Mockito.mock(...)` with `.when(...)` calls keyed on argument values, you're using the wrong tool. |
| "The `@QuarkusTest` should just verify the wiring; we'll test the actual rules in pure JUnit unit tests later." | The pure-JUnit tests don't exist yet, and "later" is a lie that codifies the absence. A `@QuarkusTest` named `XTest` that mocks `X` is a tautology that asserts only what Mockito returned — the rules in `X` go untested forever. If the rules deserve unit tests, write them now in a sibling file. Don't disguise their absence behind a `@QuarkusTest` that asserts its own stubs. |
| "Setting up real `Order` aggregates with all 15 rule combinations will be 800 lines — mocking is shorter." | Yes, real-fixture tests are longer than stub tests. Length is the cost of actually exercising the rules. A test that mocks the class under test is shorter because it tests nothing — that's not a tradeoff worth making. If the fixture is genuinely complex, factor a `OrderFixtures` builder; don't replace the test with stubs of the very method under assertion. |
| "47 existing `*ServiceTest` classes use `@InjectMock` for the class under test — consistency matters more than purity, and a one-outlier diff burns a day of review." | 47 tautologies don't become a test by majority vote. Consistency with a pattern that tests nothing propagates the bug — every new mock-the-SUT test is one more file the team thinks is covered when it isn't. Be the diff that breaks the chain; link this skill in the PR description so reviewers can see the rule being enforced rather than the cargo cult being preserved. The codebase-precedent argument is strongest exactly where the codebase is wrongest. |
| "Mocking the aggregate lets me control its behavior precisely." | The aggregate's invariants *are* the system under test for the layer below. Mocking it asserts nothing about real correctness — only that your mock returns what you told it to. Mock collaborators, never aggregates. |
| "I'll use a real database for everything; mocks are dishonest." | Integration tests are slow and shared. Mocking the application service for a *resource* test is the right scope. Save Dev Services Postgres for repository tests where the DB *is* the system under test. |
| "Tests are blocking the deploy; just disable the failing ones for now." | A skipped test is a passing test that lies. The deploy is now riskier than if you'd taken five minutes to fix the test. |

## Quick Reference

### Annotations cheat sheet

| Annotation | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `@QuarkusTest` | JVM-mode test; boots Quarkus once per test profile. |
| `@QuarkusIntegrationTest` | Packaged-mode test; runs against the `target/` artifact. |
| `@InjectMock` | Replaces a CDI bean with a Mockito mock for the test. |
| `@TestTransaction` | Wraps the test in a transaction that rolls back at the end. |
| `@TestProfile(MyProfile.class)` | Run a subset of tests under a different config profile. |

### REST Assured idiom

```java
given()
    .contentType("application/json")
    .body(requestObject)
.when()
    .post("/orders")
.then()
    .statusCode(201)
    .header("Location", containsString("/orders/"))
    .body("id", notNullValue());
```

### Mocking decision

| You want to... | Use |
|---|---|
| Mock a CDI bean (always start here) | `@InjectMock` field + `Mockito.when(...)` in `@BeforeEach` |
| Install a hand-rolled fake or stateful test double in place of a CDI bean (Rule 4a) | `QuarkusMock.installMockForType(myFake, T.class)` in `@BeforeAll` |
| Mock a normal-scoped bean (`@ApplicationScoped` / `@RequestScoped`) so *other* beans see the mock too (Rule 4b) | `QuarkusMock.installMockForType` in `@BeforeAll` |
| Swap the mock implementation for one test method only (Rule 4c + Rule 5) | `QuarkusMock.installMockForInstance(perTest, installedDefault)` inside the test method |
| Run tests in parallel with mocks (Rule 6) | Stick to `@InjectMock` — `QuarkusMock` is unsafe under parallel execution |
| Test a real CDI bean against a real DB | `@QuarkusTest` + `@Inject` + `@TestTransaction` |
| Test a domain type's invariants | Plain JUnit, no Quarkus annotations |

### Run commands

| Task | Command |
|---|---|
| Unit tests only | `./mvnw test` |
| Single test | `./mvnw test -Dtest=OrdersResourceTest` |
| Single test method | `./mvnw test -Dtest=OrdersResourceTest#getOrderReturns404WhenMissing` |
| Include integration tests | `./mvnw verify -DskipITs=false` |
| Continuous testing in dev mode | `./mvnw quarkus:dev`, then press `r` |
| Native ITs | `./mvnw verify -Dnative` |
