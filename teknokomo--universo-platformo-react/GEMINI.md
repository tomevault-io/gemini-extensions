# Runtime UI UX Quality Gate

When work touches MUI runtime screens, app-template dashboards, metahub template UI metadata, CRUD dialogs, DataGrid/table/card displays, relation builders, resource-source fields, or UI E2E flows, use the project-local skills `.agents/skills/mui-runtime-ux-patterns` and `.agents/skills/runtime-ux-qa`.

Non-negotiable runtime UI rules:

-   No raw user-facing IDs or hidden-knowledge workflows on normal user surfaces.
-   No raw JSON, `[object Object]`, or object cells in normal tables/cards.
-   Semantic long-text fields are multiline by default.
-   Validation messages are localized and user-facing.
-   Reuse existing MUI dashboard/app-template primitives before creating new UI.
-   Implemented UI needs browser UX evidence, including no page-level horizontal overflow.

# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- Monorepo with feature apps under `packages/`.
  - Examples: `packages/publish-frontend` (React front end), `packages/publish-backend` (Node/Express back end), `packages/updl` (UPDL tools).
  - Each app contains a `base/` directory for the default implementation.
- Front-end apps include `i18n/` with default locales `en/` and `ru/`.
- Context docs and planning live in `memory-bank/` (`productContext`, `techContext`, `progress`, `tasks`).
- **Template system**: Two built-in metahub templates — `basic` (minimal widgets) and `basic-demo` (full demo with sample entities). Template data lives in `packages/metahubs-backend/base/src/domains/templates/data/`.
- **Create options**: `POST /metahubs` accepts optional `createOptions` (`createHub`, `createCatalog`, `createSet`, `createEnumeration` — all default true) to control which default entities are seeded.
- **Entity settings**: Five entity detail views (Hub, Catalog, Set, Enumeration, Publication) include a "Settings" tab that opens an edit dialog overlay via `EntityFormDialog`.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `pnpm install`: Install workspace dependencies.
- `pnpm dev`: Start development servers (run from the target app directory when applicable). Important: due to repo size and resource usage, only the user should run this locally; agents must not run it automatically.
- `pnpm --filter <package> build`: Build a single package to validate it quickly (e.g., lint/type errors). Note: changes are fully applied across the workspace only after a full root rebuild.
- `pnpm build` (root): Full workspace rebuild; required to propagate changes (even for a single package) and ensure cross-dependency consistency.
- `pnpm start`: Run production server(s) for built apps.
- `pnpm lint`: Run ESLint across the workspace. For checking specific packages, use `pnpm --filter <package> lint` (e.g., `pnpm --filter publish-frontend lint`) to avoid long execution times. Run global lint only when necessary and with user approval.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Prefer TypeScript where present; otherwise modern ES modules.
- Indentation: 2 spaces; avoid trailing whitespace.
- React: `PascalCase` components, `camelCase` hooks/utils, `kebab-case` folders/files.
- i18n keys use dot notation (e.g., `auth.login.button`).
- Branch names use English only (e.g., `feature/publish-workflow`, `fix/updl-parser`).

## Testing Guidelines
- Tests live near code in `__tests__/` or `tests/` when present.
- Write unit tests for utilities and integration tests for API routes.
- Run via `pnpm test` if configured in the target app; otherwise document manual steps in the PR.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Use Conventional Commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`, with optional scope (e.g., `feat(publish-frontend): add i18n loader`).
- PRs include: clear description, linked issues, screenshots for UI, and notes on env vars or migrations.
- Small, focused PRs are preferred; include `packages/*/base` paths in the scope when relevant.

## Security & Configuration Tips
- Never commit secrets. Use `.env`/`.env.local` and keep Supabase keys private.
- If provided, copy example envs (e.g., `cp .env.example .env`) and update per app.

# Recommendations

## 1. General Principles

1.  **Review Local READMEs**: Before starting a task, always review the `README.md` in the relevant package's directory (e.g., `packages/profile-frontend/base/README.md`).
2.  **Adhere to Linters**: Always follow the project's configured linters when writing code to ensure consistency and quality. For linting, use `pnpm --filter <package> lint` instead of global `pnpm lint` to optimize execution time in the large workspace.
3.  **Language**: Respond to the user in Russian. However, all code comments and all information in the `memory-bank` folder must be written in English only.

## 2. Creating New Packages in `packages/<package-name>`

### 2.1. Workspace Imports

*   **DO**: When importing from another local package in the monorepo, always use the full PNPM workspace package name as defined in its `package.json` (e.g., `import { something } from '@universo/types'`).
*   **DO NOT**: Never use relative paths (`../`) to import across package boundaries.
*   **WHY**: This ensures correct module resolution via PNPM workspaces, prevents circular dependencies, and is critical for eventually extracting packages into separate repositories.

### 2.2. Frontend Packages (TSX)

*   **Technology**: New frontend packages must be written in **TypeScript (TSX)**.
*   **Build System**: Each new package must feature a dual-build system (similar to `packages/space-builder-frontend`) to compile TSX into both **CommonJS** and **ES Modules**.
    *   Use two `tsconfig.json` files (`tsconfig.json` for CJS, `tsconfig.esm.json` for ESM).
    *   The compiled JavaScript output must be placed in a `dist/` directory within the package.
*   **Integration**: The package's `package.json` must correctly specify the `main` (for CJS) and `module` (for ESM) entry points, pointing to the compiled files in `dist/`. This allows new TSX components to be directly imported into the existing codebase (`packages/universo-core-frontend/base`) as standard dependencies.

### 2.3. Backend Packages (Knex + SQL Migrations)

*   **Data Access Pattern**: Direct database calls (e.g., to the Supabase client) are forbidden. All database interaction **must** go through **store modules** that use `DbExecutor.query()` with raw SQL.
*   **Database Target**: Currently, all schemas and migrations should be written for **PostgreSQL**, as it is the only database in use (via Supabase).
*   **Three-Tier Rule**: Tier 1 uses request-scoped executors for authenticated RLS flows, Tier 2 uses `getPoolExecutor()` for admin/bootstrap/public non-RLS work, and Tier 3 raw Knex is allowed only inside infrastructure, migrations, or explicit package-local DDL boundaries.
*   **Knex Boundary Rule**: Domain route handlers, stores, and services must not import `knex`, `KnexClient`, or call `getKnex()` directly. If a package needs DDL/runtime schema work, isolate it behind a dedicated boundary such as `src/ddl/index.ts`.
*   **SQL Safety Rule**: Domain SQL must be schema-qualified, parameterized with `$1`, `$2`, and use `qSchema`, `qTable`, `qSchemaTable`, or `qColumn` for every dynamic identifier.
*   **Mutation Rule**: UPDATE and DELETE flows should use `RETURNING` when row confirmation matters and must fail closed on zero-row results instead of silently succeeding.
*   **Testing Rule**: Critical SQL-first stores and service-level mutation contracts need direct tests, not only route-level mocks.
*   **Creating a New Service**: When creating a new backend service in `packages/` that requires database access, you must:
    1.  **Define SQL Migrations**: Create platform migration definitions in your package's `src/migrations/` directory using `createSchemaMigrationDefinition()` from `@universo/schema-ddl`.
    2.  **Register Migrations**: Import your migration definition into `packages/universo-migrations-platform/base/src/platformMigrations.ts` and add it to the `platformMigrations` array.
    3.  **Create Store Modules**: Write store files (e.g., `myStore.ts`) that accept a `DbExecutor` and run SQL queries via `executor.query(sql, params)`. Use `$1`, `$2`, etc. for PostgreSQL bind parameters.
    4.  **Use Request Executor**: In route handlers, obtain the request-scoped executor via `getRequestDbExecutor(req, getDbExecutor())` from `@universo/utils`. This ensures RLS context is applied.
