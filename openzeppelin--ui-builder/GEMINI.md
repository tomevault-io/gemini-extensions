# Framework-Specific Rules

When working with React components:

- Use functional components with hooks
- Prefer destructuring props
- Keep components focused on a single responsibility
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
- Use memoization (useMemo, useCallback) for expensive operations
- Use React.ComponentRef instead of React.ElementRef

# Monorepo Architecture

Workspace structure (selected):

- **packages/builder** - Main application with builder UI and export system
- **packages/renderer** - Shared rendering library
- **packages/ui** - Shared UI components
- **packages/types** - Shared types
- **packages/styles** - Centralized styles
- **packages/utils** - Utilities
- **packages/react-core** - React providers/hooks
- **packages/storage** - IndexedDB storage
- **packages/adapter-\*** - Chain‑specific adapters

Guidelines for monorepo development:

- Keep core rendering logic in the renderer package
- The builder app imports shared libraries by published package names (no cross‑package source imports outside configured aliases/virtual modules)
- Each package has its own tsconfig.json extending from the root tsconfig.base.json
- Run commands with package filtering: `pnpm --filter=@openzeppelin/ui-builder-app <command>`
- Use workspace-level commands when applicable: `pnpm -r <command>` (runs in all packages)
- Keep package.json scripts synchronized between packages for consistency

# Frontend Architecture

Architecture patterns:

- Component-driven development with composition patterns
- Separation of UI components from business logic
- Headless UI pattern (shadcn/ui + Radix) for accessibility and customization
- Atomic design principles for component organization
- Custom hooks for shared stateful logic
- Utility functions for shared stateless logic
- Shared form rendering logic in the form-renderer package

# TypeScript

[tsconfig.json](mdc:packages/builder/tsconfig.json)
[tsconfig.json](mdc:packages/renderer/tsconfig.json)
[tsconfig.base.json](mdc:tsconfig.base.json)
[tsconfig.json](mdc:tsconfig.json)

When writing TypeScript:

- Use explicit return types for functions and React components
- Prefer interfaces for public APIs and types for internal usage
- Use proper type narrowing instead of type assertions (avoid `as` casts)
- Leverage TypeScript's utility types (Partial, Pick, Omit, etc.)
- Prefer readonly arrays and properties when data shouldn't change
- Use discriminated unions for state management
- Ensure strict null checks by avoiding `!` assertions
- Use path aliases for imports between packages:
  - Within builder: `@/` for src directory
  - Use published package imports (e.g., `@openzeppelin/ui-builder-renderer`) and configured aliases

# Tailwind CSS v4

[tailwind.config.cjs](mdc:packages/builder/tailwind.config.cjs)
[postcss.config.cjs](mdc:postcss.config.cjs)
[index.css](mdc:packages/builder/src/index.css)

When using Tailwind CSS v4:

- Use centralized `@styles/global.css` and semantic classes (`bg-primary`, etc.)
- Use simplified class names like `bg-primary` instead of verbose `bg-[hsl(var(--color))]` syntax
- Define colors using OKLCH format for better color reproduction (e.g., `--color-primary: oklch(0.5 0.2 120)`)
- Use Tailwind's built-in dark mode with the 'class' strategy
- Use component composition rather than extending with apply when possible
- For complex UI patterns, create reusable components instead of utility classes
- Follow the container pattern for responsive layouts
- Use responsive variants (sm:, md:, lg:) consistently
- Import Tailwind with `@import "tailwindcss";` instead of the older directive syntax

# Component Variants

[button-variants.ts](mdc:packages/builder/src/core/utils/button-variants.ts)

When working with component variants:

- Use the `cva` function from class-variance-authority for defining variant styles
- Organize variants in dedicated files (e.g., `button-variants.ts`)
- Follow a consistent pattern for variant definitions:
  - Define a base style that applies to all variants
  - Group related variants (e.g., size, color, shape)
  - Include default variants where appropriate
- Compose variants from other variants when possible for consistency
- Use the shadcn/ui configuration in components.json for style customization
- Update the Tailwind theme when adding new design tokens
- Use variant props with TypeScript's template literal types for type safety

# Vite

[vite.config.ts](mdc:packages/builder/vite.config.ts)

When configuring Vite:

- Use path aliases for cleaner imports (e.g., '@/' for src directory)
- Configure cross-package imports with proper aliases
- Leverage Vite plugins for additional functionality
- Configure build optimization settings for production builds
- Use environment variables with import.meta.env
- Consider chunk splitting strategies for larger applications
- Use the correct file extensions (.js for ESM, .cjs for CommonJS)

# Testing

[vitest.config.ts](mdc:packages/builder/vitest.config.ts)
[setup.ts](mdc:packages/builder/test/setup.ts)

Testing strategy:

- Use Vitest for unit and integration testing
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Mock external dependencies using vi.mock()
- Use Testing Library's user-event for simulating interactions
- Test component behavior, not implementation details
- Use test coverage reporting to identify untested code
- Create test fixtures for reusable test data
- For complex UI, prefer focused component tests with Testing Library
- Test cross-package integration points

# Quality & Standards

[eslint.config.cjs](mdc:packages/builder/eslint.config.cjs)
[commitlint.config.js](mdc:commitlint.config.js)

Coding standards:

- Follow ESLint configuration rules for consistent code style
- Use simple-import-sort plugin to organize imports in a standard order
- Follow Conventional Commits format: type(scope): subject
- Valid scopes include: ui, api, auth, builder, export, deps, config, ci, renderer, react-core, types, transaction, utils, docs, tests, release, adapter, adapter-evm, adapter-solana, adapter-stellar, adapter-midnight, styles, storage, common
- Run 'pnpm fix-all' before pushing to fix linting and formatting issues
- Keep components focused with single responsibility principle
- Limit component complexity (max ~150 lines, extract as needed)

# Build & Deploy

[ci.yml](mdc:.github/workflows/ci.yml)
[publish.yml](mdc:.github/workflows/publish.yml)

CI/CD configuration:

- GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipelines
- Changesets for versioning and release PRs
- Coverage reports and badges generated via Vitest
- ESM syntax is used throughout the codebase
- Use 'type: module' in package.json with .cjs extension for CommonJS files
- PR checks ensure code quality before merging
- Husky bypassed in CI environment to avoid conflicts
- Monorepo builds are orchestrated with proper dependencies

# Package Management

[package.json](mdc:package.json)
[pnpm-workspace.yaml](mdc:pnpm-workspace.yaml)
[package.json](mdc:packages/builder/package.json)
[package.json](mdc:packages/renderer/package.json)

Dependencies management:

- Use pnpm for package management (9.x+)
- Use pnpm workspaces for monorepo management
- Run 'pnpm outdated' to check for outdated dependencies
- Use scripts in package.json for common development tasks
- Follow semantic versioning for dependencies
- Use script aliases for complex commands
- Prefer devDependencies for build-time dependencies
- Keep dependencies lean to minimize bundle size
- Ensure proper cross-package dependencies in workspace packages

# Git Workflow

[pre-commit](mdc:.husky/pre-commit)
[commit-msg](mdc:.husky/commit-msg)
[pre-push](mdc:.husky/pre-push)

Development workflow:

- Husky hooks ensure code quality before commits and pushes
- Commit messages must follow Conventional Commits standard
- Commit message scope must be one of [ui, api, auth, builder, export, deps, config, ci, renderer, react-core, types, transaction, utils, docs, tests, release, adapter, adapter-evm, adapter-solana, adapter-stellar, adapter-midnight, styles, storage, common]
- Pre-push runs linting, formatting, and tests
- Use 'pnpm commit' for guided commit message creation with commitizen
- Create feature branches for new work
- Keep commits focused and atomic
- Document breaking changes in commit messages
