# AGENTS.md - Codex-Synaptic Agent System Architecture

## Overview

The Codex-Synaptic system enhances OpenAI's Codex with advanced multi-agent capabilities, featuring MCP/A2A bridging, neural meshes, swarm coordination, topological constraints, and various consensus mechanisms. This document outlines the comprehensive agent architecture and deployment strategies.

## Operator Notes — 2025-11-05

- **Consensus gating:** ✅ **RESOLVED** — Hive-mind runs now automatically deploy 3+ voting agents (consensus_coordinator, review_worker, planning_worker) to ensure RAFT consensus quorum is reached. The quorum threshold has been adjusted to 2 votes minimum (40% quorum factor) for improved availability while maintaining consensus integrity.
- **Autoscaler behaviour:** With the background daemon disabled, idle worker retirement requests cannot execute. Expect scale-down warnings in logs and manually right-size replicas after experiments. See `docs/runbooks/autoscaler-daemon-coordination.md` for operational guidance.
- **Repository hygiene:** Active development is running from the local `codex-synaptic-clone` directory, but upstream pushes must target `github.com/clduab11/codex-synaptic`. Align the folder/remote names before release packaging so automation recipes resolve assets correctly. See `docs/runbooks/workspace-rename-guide.md` for the step-by-step procedure.

## Startup Gate (Codex For macOS)

- Run `codex-synaptic launch --json` before repository work whenever the user asks to launch or verify readiness first.
- Treat launch as a hard gate: if `ok` is `false` (or the command exits non-zero), stop and only return remediation commands.
- Proceed with repository changes only when launch returns `ok=true` and `nextAction="continue"`.
- Default launch gate profiles are `mcp-filesystem`, `mcp-playwright`, and `mcp-desktop-commander`.

### 4. Platform Capabilities

- **Auto-scaling Manager** – monitors CPU/memory and triggers balanced worker scale-up/down, persisting events to `autoscaler_events`.
- **Self-Healing Mesh** – repairs topology gaps automatically and logs activity to `mesh_events`.
- **Vector Memory Service** – optional local/Qdrant/Redis vector store for knowledge retrieval; managed via `vector` config.
- **Cheat Code Catalog** – consult `docs/codex-synaptic-cheat-codes.md` for command combos.
- **Observability Toolkit** – see `docs/observability/README.md` for dashboard + metrics wiring.
- **Consensus Telemetry** – decisions are archived under `consensus_events` for audit trails.

#### Consensus Voting Roles

The Codex-Synaptic consensus system employs **distributed decision-making** where multiple agent types participate in voting to ensure decisions benefit from diverse domain expertise:

**Voting Agent Types:**
- **ConsensusCoordinator** – Specialized in consensus protocols and quorum management
- **ReviewWorker** – Provides quality assurance and code review perspective
- **PlanningWorker** – Contributes strategic planning and roadmap considerations

**Rationale:**  
By enabling three distinct agent types to vote, the system achieves more balanced decision-making. Review and planning agents bring domain-specific context that complements pure consensus coordination, reducing the risk of overlooking quality or strategic concerns during approval gates.

**Configuration:**  
The quorum requirements are defined in `config/system.json` under the `consensus` section:
- `minVotes`: Minimum number of votes required (default: 2)
- `quorumFactor`: Fraction of available voting agents needed (default: 0.4 or 40%)
- With 3+ voting agents deployed by default, this ensures at least 2-of-3 quorum for reliability

**Deployment:**  
The system automatically deploys voting agents during bootstrap (`bootstrapDefaultAgents()`) and hive-mind spawns (`analyzePromptForAgents()`), ensuring consensus workflows never timeout due to insufficient quorum.

### 2. Coordinator Agents
Higher-level agents that manage and orchestrate worker agents.

#### SwarmCoordinator
- **Purpose**: Multi-agent task distribution and synchronization
- **Capabilities**: Load balancing, task scheduling, resource optimization
- **Interface**: Agent registry, task queue management
- **Deployment**: Central coordination nodes

#### ConsensusCoordinator
- **Purpose**: Distributed decision making and agreement protocols
- **Capabilities**: Byzantine fault tolerance, RAFT consensus, voting mechanisms
- **Interface**: Peer-to-peer communication, state synchronization
- **Deployment**: Distributed consensus network

#### TopologyCoordinator
- **Purpose**: Network structure management and optimization
- **Capabilities**: Dynamic topology adjustment, path optimization, load distribution
- **Interface**: Network graph management, routing protocols
- **Deployment**: Edge and core network positions

### 3. Bridge Agents
Specialized agents for inter-system communication and protocol translation.

#### MCPBridge (Model Control Protocol)
- **Purpose**: Seamless integration between different AI models and systems
- **Capabilities**: Protocol translation, model orchestration, API abstraction
- **Interface**: Multi-model API support, standardized communication protocols
- **Deployment**: Gateway and proxy configurations

## Agent Development Playbook

This section provides operational guidance for working with agents inside Codex-Synaptic, including how to reason about the orchestration runtime and extend the system safely. Use it alongside the CLI help output and the module-level documentation in `src/`.

### Runtime Overview

The `CodexSynapticSystem` (see `src/core/system.ts`) coordinates several subsystems:

- **Agent Registry (`src/agents/registry.ts`)** – Tracks lifecycle, status, capabilities, and resource usage for every agent instance.
- **Task Scheduler (`src/core/scheduler.ts`)** – Assigns queued work to available agents based on capabilities and priority.
- **Neural Mesh (`src/mesh`)** – Maintains graph-based connectivity, enforces topology constraints, and exposes metrics for telemetry.
- **Swarm Coordinator (`src/swarm`)** – Runs PSO/ACO/flocking optimisers for collaborative problem solving and hive-mind scenarios.
- **Consensus Manager (`src/consensus`)** – Manages proposals, votes, and quorum checks for distributed decisions.
- **Bridges (`src/bridging`, `src/mcp`)** – Provide controlled ingress/egress for MCP and A2A messaging.
- **Memory System (`src/memory/memory-system.ts`)** – SQLite-backed persistent storage for agent interactions and artefacts under `~/.codex-synaptic/memory.db`.
- **Telemetry & Health (`src/core/health.ts`, `src/core/resources.ts`)** – Surfaced via CLI commands and used to gate scaling/auto-healing decisions.

### Built-in Agent Roles

| Agent Type | Purpose | Key Implementation |
|------------|---------|--------------------| 
| `code_worker` | Code generation, refactoring, and implementation tasks | `src/agents/code_worker.ts` |
| `data_worker` | Data preparation, analysis, and transformation | `src/agents/data_worker.ts` |
| `validation_worker` | Verification, linting, and quality gates | `src/agents/validation_worker.ts` |
| `swarm_coordinator` | Supervises swarm objectives and metrics | `src/agents/swarm_coordinator.ts` |
| `consensus_coordinator` | Runs vote aggregation and conflict resolution | `src/agents/consensus_coordinator.ts` |
| `topology_coordinator` | Adjusts mesh connectivity and constraints | `src/agents/topology_coordinator.ts` |
| `mcp_bridge` / `a2a_bridge` | Translate external requests into internal tasks | `src/agents/mcp_bridge_agent.ts`, `src/agents/a2a_bridge_agent.ts` |

### Execution Flow

1. **System start** – `codex-synaptic system start` boots the orchestrator, loads configuration, and initialises telemetry, GPU probes, and memory storage.
2. **Agent bootstrap** – Default agents are registered; additional replicas can be deployed via `codex-synaptic agent deploy`.
3. **Mesh configuration** – Mesh defaults can be tuned (`codex-synaptic mesh configure --nodes 8 --topology mesh`) before dispatching complex tasks.
4. **Swarm activation** – `codex-synaptic swarm start --algorithm pso` enables collaborative optimisation loops used by hive-mind workflows.
5. **Task dispatch** – Tasks submitted through the CLI or API enter the scheduler queue, receive capability-matched agents, and stream status events.
6. **Consensus checks** – Critical decisions (e.g., promotion of artefacts) can be gated behind proposals/votes via `codex-synaptic consensus ...` commands.
7. **Telemetry + persistence** – Health snapshots, resource metrics, and memory entries are persisted so the background daemon and CLI can resume seamlessly.

### Agent Development Guidelines

- **Keep responsibilities focused.** New agent types should expose clear capabilities and register them through the agent registry utilities.
- **Instrument long running tasks.** Emit progress and heartbeat events so the scheduler keeps accurate status and the telemetry surface stays fresh.
- **Respect resource limits.** Read limits from `ResourceManager` and avoid allocating beyond configured CPU/memory bounds.
- **Integrate with memory.** Use `CodexMemorySystem` to store durable artefacts or contextual knowledge shared across runs.
- **Participate in consensus when required.** Agents that introduce risky changes should submit proposals or votes with enough context for auditability.

### CLI Workflow Tips

- Run `codex-synaptic system monitor` in a dedicated terminal when developing new agent logic.
- Use the `background` commands to keep long-running coordination alive between sessions.
- Combine `mesh` and `swarm` commands to stress-test new strategies before exposing them to production tasks.
- Query `codex-synaptic task recent` to audit how prompts flow through the system and to inspect generated artefacts.

### Extending the Platform

1. Scaffold a new agent under `src/agents/` and register it with the agent registry.
2. Add capabilities and resource requirements so the scheduler can route work correctly.
3. Update CLI help (if you expose new coordination primitives) in `src/cli/index.ts`.
4. Document the new workflow in `docs/` or the README so operators understand how to invoke it.
5. Add corresponding Vitest coverage under `tests/` to lock in behaviour.

Following these conventions keeps the Codex-Synaptic ecosystem consistent and makes it easier for the CLI, telemetry, and automation hooks to reason about every agent in the mesh.

## Conclusion

The Codex-Synaptic agent system provides a comprehensive framework for enhancing OpenAI's Codex with advanced distributed computing capabilities. Through careful orchestration of various agent types, consensus mechanisms, and coordination patterns, the system can tackle complex computational challenges that require distributed intelligence, fault tolerance, and scalable coordination.
