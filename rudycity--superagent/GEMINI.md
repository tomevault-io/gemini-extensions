# Project Specifications (agents.md) 

This file contains key information about the project for AI agents to study and align with when working on Superagent.

## Project Overview
- **Name**: Superagent
- **Description**: An interactive, terminal-based AI coding assistant featuring a cyberpunk style terminal UI, context token tracking, and a 3-tier multi-agent orchestration system (Master Agent → Superagent → Subagent).
- **Technology Stack**: Node.js, TypeScript, React, Ink (Terminal UI Components), Vercel AI SDK, Execa, Vitest
- **Desktop Client Integration (t-line)**: Superagent integrates with [t-line](file:///D:/backup%20from%20pc%20asus/Documents%20Development/t-line), which is the desktop version of the superagent CLI. This is supported via a client/server bridge mode (`superagent --server [port] --client-mode tline`).

## 3-Tier Multi-Agent Architecture

Superagent supports a full 3-tier agent hierarchy activated via `superagent --multi`:

```
Master Agent  (orchestrator)
  └── Superagent  (per-feature, isolated in git worktree)
        └── Subagent  (atomic ops, ephemeral)
```

### Tier Responsibilities
| Tier | Role | Toolset | Isolation |
|------|------|---------|-----------|
| **Master Agent** | Orchestration, planning, result merging | `invokeSuperagentTool`, `awaitSuperagentsTool`, `mergeSuperagentsTool`, `manageSuperagentsTool`, `manageSubagentsTool`, `gitWorktreeTool` | Main repo |
| **Superagent** | Feature-level development | Shell + File tools + `invokeSubagentTool`, `manageSubagentsTool`, `gitWorktreeTool` | Isolated git worktree (`~/.superagent-r/worktrees/<name>`) |
| **Subagent** | Ephemeral subagent types (e.g. `researcher`, `coder`, `reviewer`, `software-tester`, `chrome-agent`). Note that Chrome/browser control is isolated to `chrome-agent`. | Tools allowed per subagent type | Ephemeral, within parent worktree |

### Key Files

- `src/core/tools/types.ts` — Shared types: `AgentTier`, `SubagentInstance`, `ToolSet`
- `src/core/tools/toolsets.ts` — ToolSet definitions keyed per tier (`masterToolset`, `superagentToolsets`, `subagentToolsets`)
- `src/core/tools/prompts.ts` — System prompts per tier with dynamic context injection
- `src/core/tools/state.ts` — Shared subagent registry, instances map, event emitters
- `src/core/tools/superagentTools.ts` — Master tier tools: invoke/list/merge/manage Superagents
- `src/core/tools/subagentTools.ts` — Superagent tier tools: spawn ephemeral Subagents
- `src/core/context/ContextManager.ts` — Central orchestrator for context window management (state machine, strategy selection, recovery)
- `src/core/context/TokenTracker.ts` — Model-specific token counting via tiktoken (includes tool calls/results)

- `chrome-extension-remote/` — Standalone lightweight Chrome Extension (Manifest V3) for remote-controlling any Chrome profile/browser from Superagent CLI via serverless WebSocket bridge (port 9223). No sidepanel GUI; minimal footprint, multi-profile capable.
- `chrome-extension/` — Full Superagent AI assistant Chrome Extension (Manifest V3) with sidepanel GUI for browser control, tab/DOM management, text/markdown extraction, console/network logs, storage/cookies management, device emulation, and more. Installed directly in target browser it controls.
- `src/core/tools/remoteChromeBridge.ts` — Serverless WebSocket server (port 9223) auto-initialized on-demand by Superagent CLI; communication backbone for `chrome-extension-remote/`.

## Coding Guidelines & Constraints
- **Language — English Only**: All user-facing text strings, UI labels, log messages, comments, variable names, documentation, and any other text content MUST be written in English. No exceptions.
- **Shell Commands**: On Windows, the actual shell is auto-detected (Git Bash is preferred over PowerShell). If using PowerShell, use `;` to separate commands instead of `&&`. Git Bash supports `&&` normally. The system prompt reports the detected shell accurately.
- **Strict Naming Rules**: Do NOT mention proprietary brand names like "Claude Code" or generic "CLI" terms in user-facing documentation or UI descriptions. Refer to the project as a terminal-based AI coding assistant.
- **Workspace Isolation & Database**: Session history, metadata, and cross-session search are indexed using SQLite (`~/.superagent-r/history.db` via `src/core/storage/historyDb.ts`). **SQLite is the single source of truth for chat transcripts** — messages are stored in the `messages` table with FTS5 full-text search. Artifacts (plans, tasks, walkthroughs) are stored in `~/.superagent-r/history/<mode>/<sessionId>/`. Superagent worktrees are stored under `~/.superagent-r/worktrees/<name>`. Configuration (`model-config.json`) and logs (`superagent.log`) remain in `~/.superagent-r/`.
  - **IMPORTANT**: The `.json` file at `~/.superagent-r/history/<mode>/<sessionId>/sess_*.json` is **NOT** a transcript storage file. It is a **0-byte placeholder** — its filePath is used only as a session key/identifier and for deriving plan/task/walkthrough file paths. **Do NOT read or write transcript data to/from the JSON file.** Always use SQLite (`loadSessionFromDb()` / `saveSessionToDb()` from `src/core/storage/historyDb.ts`) for chat transcript operations.
- **Model Config & Credentials — JSON ONLY, NO process.env**: All provider credentials, model configurations, active presets, tier models, profiles, and system settings are stored exclusively in `~/.superagent-r/model-config.json`. There is **NO** use of `process.env` for model, provider, or settings data anywhere in production code. This is a hard rule with NO exceptions:
  - **Reading models**: Use helper functions from `src/core/config/providers.ts`:
    - `getEffectiveMasterModel(mode)` — returns the primary model name for the given mode (`"multi"`, `"single"`, or `"auto"`)
    - `getTierModel(mode, tier)` — returns a specific tier's model (`tier`: `"master"`, `"superagent"`, `"subagent"`, `"researcher"`, `"coder"`, `"reviewer"`, or any custom subagent name)
    - `getAllTierModels(mode)` — returns a `Record<string, string>` of all tier models including subagent details
  - **Writing models**: Use helper functions from `src/core/config/providers.ts`:
    - `setTierModel(mode, tier, modelName, providerProfileId?)` — writes a specific tier's model to JSON and persists
    - `setAllTierModels(mode, modelName, providerProfileId?)` — writes ALL tiers at once to JSON and persists
    - `clearTierModel(mode, tier)` — clears a tier's model override
  - **Provider info**: Use `getActiveProviderName()` and `getConfiguredProviders()` — both read from JSON, never from env vars.
  - **System settings** (concurrency, rate limit, streaming, context window, max iterations): Use `getSettings()` to read and `updateSettings()` to write — both from `src/core/config/jsonConfig.ts`. These functions read/write directly to `model-config.json`. **NEVER use `process.env` to read or write settings.**
  - `/login` (add provider wizard): use `addProvider()` to save to JSON, then `switchActiveProvider()` to activate.
  - `/model` (model/preset wizard): use `savePreset()`, `applyModelPreset()`, `setTierModel()`, `setAllTierModels()` — all JSON.
  - `/settings` (settings commands): use `getSettings()` to display and `updateSettings()` to persist — all JSON.
  - **NEVER read or write `process.env.MODEL`, `process.env.MODEL_*`, `process.env.ACTIVE_PROVIDER`, `process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `process.env.CUSTOM_BASE_URL`, `process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY`, `process.env.SUPERAGENT_MAX_CONCURRENCY`, `process.env.SUPERAGENT_RATE_LIMIT_*`, `process.env.DISABLE_STREAMING`, `process.env.CONTEXT_WINDOW_LIMIT`, or `process.env.MAX_ITERATIONS`** — all of these have been fully migrated to JSON config helpers (`getSettings()`, `getTierModel()`, `getConfiguredProviders()`, etc.).
  - **`updateEnvFile()` has been removed** — it no longer exists. The file `src/core/config/env.ts` has been deleted. All config flows through `jsonConfig.ts` functions.
- **Interactive Prompts**: Ensure any executed shell command processes are monitored for interactive inputs (such as asking for yes/no confirmation) to alert the user rather than hanging in the background.
- **Test Location**: Always create and place all test files inside the `tests/` directory at the project root. Do not place test files under the `src/` directory.
- **Circular Dependency Prevention**: `toolsets.ts` and `prompts.ts` are imported by multiple tool files. Any tool file that needs to import from `toolsets.ts` or `prompts.ts` MUST use dynamic `import()` inside the `execute()` function body — never a top-level static import — to avoid circular module dependency errors.
- **Tier Enforcement**: Do NOT add orchestration tools (e.g., `invokeSubagentTool`) to Superagent or Subagent toolsets. Each tier must only have the tools listed in `toolsets.ts` for that tier.
- **Master Agent Planning**: The Master Agent is restricted from directly modifying codebase files and MUST delegate all feature implementation to Superagents. Therefore, the Master Agent's Implementation Plan and Task Tracking files MUST explicitly focus on spawning, monitoring, and merging Superagents (specifying their roles, git branches, and feature tasks) rather than detailing direct file edits as if it were performing them itself.
- **Commit, Versioning, and Changelog**: Every change, task, or completed feature must be staged and committed to the git repository. You must also bump the package version in `package.json` and document the changes in `CHANGELOG.md`.
- **Code Limits & Architecture**: Keep all code files strictly under 1000 lines to ensure readability. Always design with a single source of truth, focus on modularity, maintainability, scalability, optimization, and strictly adhere to industry best practices.
- **Best Practices, Maintainability, Scalability, and Modularity**: Follow industry best practices. Design codebase changes to be maintainable, scalable, and modular. Maintain separation of concerns, maximize code reuse, eliminate duplication, and document code effectively.
- **Exploration & Research**: When performing codebase exploration, investigation, or research, always spawn a subagent to handle the task.
- **Mandatory Skill Reading**: At the very start of the workflow to solve any user request (such as debugging, testing, QA, refactoring, new feature development, or any other task supported by our comprehensive skills), you MUST identify all relevant skills and read their `SKILL.md` instructions using the `view_file` tool before making plans or taking action.
- **Terminal Preset Names**: When creating or setting up terminal presets (e.g. via `/terminal init` or by writing to `terminal-presets.json`), preset names (keys in the JSON configuration) MUST be short, simple, lowercase, alphanumeric characters, and may use hyphens or underscores (e.g., `'dev'`, `'build'`, `'start'`, `'test'`). Emojis are strictly prohibited in preset names to ensure they are easy for users to type in the terminal when running `/terminal <preset_name>` or `/terminal preset <preset_name>`.
- **Chrome Extension Styling (chrome-extension/)**: The sidepanel GUI in `chrome-extension/` MUST adhere strictly to a clean, premium Material-inspired Design style (similar to modern cloud consoles) with light and dark theme options. This includes using modern styling: light theme with clean cool white/grey backgrounds (#ffffff, #f0f4f9, #f8f9fa), dark theme with dark grey/charcoal backgrounds (#1e1f20, #0f0f0f, #2d2f31), clean Material blue buttons/accents (#1a73e8 or #0b57d0 in light mode, #8ab4f8 or #a8c7fa in dark mode), Outfit or Product Sans/Roboto typography for UI elements (fallback to Inter/Segoe UI), and JetBrains Mono/Roboto Mono for terminal or code outputs. Interactive elements must use soft box-shadows, modern flat styles, and generous rounded corners (typically 8px to 16px, or rounded pills for buttons) to achieve a modern, premium look.

## System Prompt Guidelines (Concept A, B, and C)
All system prompts in the codebase (e.g., in [prompts.ts](file:///d:/backup%20from%20pc%20asus/Documents%20Development/superagent/src/core/prompts.ts)) must be designed and optimized using the following guidelines:
- **Concept A: Telegraphic English (Minified Prose)**
  - Remove conversational filler, pronouns, polite phrasing, and redundant verbs.
  - Use brief, direct imperative statements.
- **Concept B: Markdown Structure**
  - Organize rules, context, workflows, and rules under clear Markdown headers (e.g., `# ROLE`, `# CRITICAL RULES`, `# WORKFLOW`).
  - Use bullet points and lists to establish a clean hierarchy.
- **Concept C: Pseudocode & Logic Gates**
  - Structure conditional flows, decision gates, or self-verification routines using programming-like logic statements (e.g., `if decision_point: CALL ask_question()`).
  - Avoid verbose natural language paragraphs for branching paths.

## Verification Checklist
- Run `bun test` to verify that all unit tests pass before committing.
- Build the project using `bun run build` to verify there are no TypeScript compilation errors.
- **Build After Changes**: Always run `bun run build` immediately after making any changes to the source files to ensure the compiled outputs in `dist/` are up to date and there are no compilation errors.
- After adding new tools, verify they are added to the correct tier toolset in `toolsets.ts` and not to other tiers.
- After modifying `subagentTools.ts` or `superagentTools.ts`, check for circular dependency issues — imports of `toolsets.ts`/`prompts.ts` must be dynamic.
