# Chapter 2: APIDataModels (Pydantic)

In Chapter 1, we explored the [FastAPIServerEndpoints](fastapiserverendpoints.mdc), which define the HTTP API for `llm-food`. We saw how endpoints like `/convert` and `/batch` use `response_model` to specify the structure of their responses. This chapter delves into those Pydantic models, collectively referred to as `APIDataModels`, which are crucial for defining and enforcing data structures for API requests and responses.

## Motivation and Purpose

The primary technical problem `APIDataModels` solve is ensuring **type safety, data validation, and a clear contract** for data exchanged between the client and the server. Without well-defined data models, APIs are prone to errors caused by mismatched data formats, missing fields, or incorrect data types. This can lead to runtime failures, difficult debugging, and a brittle system.

`APIDataModels` in `llm-food` implement the Data Transfer Object (DTO) pattern. They serve as:
-   **A source of truth** for the structure of API payloads.
-   **Automatic validators** for incoming and outgoing data (leveraging FastAPI's Pydantic integration).
-   **Serializers/Deserializers** that convert Python objects to JSON and vice-versa.
-   **Clear documentation** for API consumers about expected data formats.

**Central Use Case:** When a client requests a file conversion via the `POST /convert` endpoint (as discussed in [FastAPIServerEndpoints](fastapiserverendpoints.mdc)), the server processes the file and returns a JSON response. This response must conform to the `ConversionResponse` model. If it does, the client can reliably parse it. If the server attempts to return data in a different structure, FastAPI (using Pydantic) will raise an error, preventing malformed data from being sent.

All these models are defined in `llm_food/models.py`.

## What are Pydantic Models?

Pydantic is a Python library for data validation and settings management using Python type annotations. A Pydantic model is a class that inherits from `pydantic.BaseModel`. You define the fields of your data structure as class attributes with type hints.

```python
# llm_food/models.py (Conceptual Example)
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import List

class MySimpleModel(BaseModel):
    name: str
    count: int
    tags: List[str] = [] # Optional field with a default value
```
Pydantic will automatically:
-   Validate that data provided to create an instance of `MySimpleModel` matches the types (e.g., `name` is a string, `count` is an integer).
-   Convert types where possible (e.g., a string `"5"` to an integer `5` for `count`).
-   Provide default values if data for a field is not supplied.
-   Raise validation errors if data is incorrect or missing for required fields.

FastAPI uses these models extensively. When you declare a Pydantic model as a `response_model` for an endpoint, FastAPI ensures the returned data conforms to this model and serializes it to JSON. If used for request bodies, FastAPI validates incoming JSON data against the model.

## Key API Data Models in `llm-food`

Let's examine the core Pydantic models used in `llm-food` for API communication.

### 1. `ConversionResponse`

This model defines the structure of the JSON response for synchronous conversion requests (e.g., `POST /convert` and `GET /convert` endpoints).

**Purpose:** To return the converted text content along with metadata about the original file.

**Structure (`llm_food/models.py`):**
```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import List

class ConversionResponse(BaseModel):
    filename: str
    content_hash: str
    texts: List[str]
```
-   `filename`: The name of the original file or a derived name from the URL.
-   `content_hash`: A SHA256 hash of the original file content.
-   `texts`: A list of strings, where each string typically represents a page or a section of the converted document (e.g., Markdown content).

**Example JSON Response (for `/convert`):**
```json
{
  "filename": "mydocument.docx",
  "content_hash": "a1b2c3d4e5f6...",
  "texts": ["Converted page 1 content...", "Converted page 2 content..."]
}
```

### 2. Batch Processing Models

Batch processing involves multiple files and asynchronous operations, requiring more complex data models for status updates and results.

#### `FileTaskDetail`

This sub-model provides details about the processing status of an individual file (or a part of it, like a PDF page) within a batch job.

**Purpose:** To give granular status updates for each item in a batch.

**Structure (`llm_food/models.py`):**
```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import Optional

class FileTaskDetail(BaseModel):
    original_filename: str
    file_type: str
    status: str # e.g., "pending", "processing", "completed", "failed"
    gcs_output_markdown_uri: Optional[str] = None
    error_message: Optional[str] = None
    page_number: Optional[int] = None # For PDF pages
```
-   `original_filename`: The name of the file this task pertains to.
-   `file_type`: The extension or type of the file (e.g., ".docx", "pdf_page").
-   `status`: Current processing state of this file/page.
-   `gcs_output_markdown_uri`: If completed, the GCS URI of the output Markdown.
-   `error_message`: If failed, details about the error.
-   `page_number`: If the task is for a specific page of a PDF.

#### `GeminiPDFSubJobDetail`

This sub-model tracks the status of a batch processing sub-job specifically handled by the Gemini API (typically for PDF OCR).

**Purpose:** To monitor the state of an external Gemini batch operation.

**Structure (`llm_food/models.py`):**
```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import Optional, List
from datetime import datetime

class GeminiPDFSubJobDetail(BaseModel):
    gemini_batch_sub_job_id: str
    batch_job_id: str # Main llm-food batch job ID
    gemini_api_job_name: Optional[str] = None
    status: str # e.g., "pending_preparation", "submitting_to_gemini", "JOB_STATE_SUCCEEDED"
    # ... other fields like payload_gcs_uri, counts, error_message ...
    total_pdf_pages_for_batch: Optional[int] = 0
    processed_pdf_pages_count: Optional[int] = 0
    failed_pdf_pages_count: Optional[int] = 0
    created_at: datetime
    updated_at: Optional[datetime] = None
```
-   `gemini_batch_sub_job_id`: Unique ID for this specific Gemini sub-task.
-   `gemini_api_job_name`: The job name returned by the Gemini API.
-   `status`: Current status of the Gemini batch job, often reflecting Gemini's own job states.
-   Other fields track GCS URIs, page counts, and timestamps.

#### `BatchJobStatusResponse`

This model defines the structure for the `/status/{task_id}` endpoint, providing a comprehensive overview of a batch job's progress.

**Purpose:** To allow clients to poll for the status of an ongoing batch job.

**Structure (`llm_food/models.py`):**
```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import List, Optional
from datetime import datetime
# Ensure FileTaskDetail and GeminiPDFSubJobDetail are defined or imported

class BatchJobStatusResponse(BaseModel):
    job_id: str
    output_gcs_path: str
    status: str # Overall status of the llm-food batch job
    submitted_at: datetime
    total_input_files: int
    overall_processed_count: Optional[int] = 0
    overall_failed_count: Optional[int] = 0
    last_updated_at: Optional[datetime] = None
    gemini_pdf_processing_details: List[GeminiPDFSubJobDetail] = []
    file_processing_details: List[FileTaskDetail] = []
```
-   It aggregates overall job status (`job_id`, `status`, counts) with lists of `GeminiPDFSubJobDetail` (for PDF batches) and `FileTaskDetail` (for individual file/page statuses).

#### `BatchOutputItem`

This sub-model represents a successfully processed file's output within a batch job result.

**Purpose:** To deliver the content of a successfully converted file from a batch.

**Structure (`llm_food/models.py`):**
```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class BatchOutputItem(BaseModel):
    original_filename: str
    markdown_content: str
    gcs_output_uri: str
```
-   `original_filename`: Name of the source file.
-   `markdown_content`: The converted Markdown text.
-   `gcs_output_uri`: The GCS URI where the Markdown file is stored.

#### `BatchJobFailedFileOutput`

This sub-model details an error encountered for a specific file during batch processing.

**Purpose:** To report failures for individual files within a batch.

**Structure (`llm_food/models.py`):**
```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import Optional

class BatchJobFailedFileOutput(BaseModel):
    original_filename: str
    file_type: str
    page_number: Optional[int] = None # If failure is page-specific
    error_message: Optional[str] = None
    status: str # Specific status like "failed", "retrieval_error"
```
-   Provides context for the failure, including filename, type, and error message.

#### `BatchJobOutputResponse`

This model defines the structure for the `/batch/{task_id}` endpoint when a job is completed (or completed with errors), providing the actual conversion results.

**Purpose:** To deliver the final outputs and error summaries of a completed batch job.

**Structure (`llm_food/models.py`):**
```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import List, Optional
# Ensure BatchOutputItem and BatchJobFailedFileOutput are defined/imported

class BatchJobOutputResponse(BaseModel):
    job_id: str
    status: str # e.g., "completed", "completed_with_errors"
    outputs: List[BatchOutputItem] = []
    errors: List[BatchJobFailedFileOutput] = []
    message: Optional[str] = None
```
-   Contains the `job_id` and final `status`.
-   `outputs`: A list of `BatchOutputItem` for successfully processed files.
-   `errors`: A list of `BatchJobFailedFileOutput` for files that failed.
-   `message`: An optional summary message.

## How FastAPI Leverages These Models

As seen in [FastAPIServerEndpoints](fastapiserverendpoints.mdc), FastAPI integrates seamlessly with Pydantic models.

**1. Response Serialization and Validation:**
When you define `response_model` in an endpoint decorator, FastAPI uses it to:
-   **Validate** the data returned by your path operation function. If the data doesn't match the `response_model`'s schema (e.g., missing required field, wrong type), FastAPI raises a server-side error.
-   **Serialize** the Python object (instance of the Pydantic model) into a JSON response.
-   **Document** the response structure in the automatically generated OpenAPI (Swagger UI) documentation.

```python
# llm_food/app.py (Simplified snippet from Chapter 1)
from .models import ConversionResponse # Our Pydantic model

@app.post("/convert", response_model=ConversionResponse)
async def convert_file_upload(file: UploadFile = File(...)):
    # ... processing logic ...
    texts_list = ["Processed content"]
    # The returned dict will be validated against ConversionResponse
    return {
        "filename": file.filename,
        "content_hash": "some_hash",
        "texts": texts_list
    }
    # Alternatively, return an instance:
    # return ConversionResponse(filename=file.filename, ...)
```

**2. Request Body Validation (Less common in `llm-food` direct file uploads):**
While `llm-food` primarily uses `File(...)` and `Form(...)` for uploads, if an endpoint expected a JSON request body, you could type-hint a Pydantic model:

```python
# Conceptual example, not directly in llm-food's current app.py
# from .models import SomeRequestModel # Assume this Pydantic model exists

# @app.post("/some_json_endpoint")
# async def process_json_data(data: SomeRequestModel):
#     # FastAPI automatically parses and validates the JSON body into 'data'
#     # If validation fails, a 422 Unprocessable Entity error is sent.
#     return {"message": f"Received name: {data.name}"}
```

## Benefits for Client-Side Development

These Pydantic models are not just for the server. They provide a clear, machine-readable contract for API clients:
-   **Predictable Responses:** Clients know exactly what data structure to expect for each endpoint.
-   **Structured Deserialization:** Client libraries (like the [LLMFoodClient](llmfoodclient.mdc)) can use these same model definitions (or equivalent structures) to parse JSON responses into typed objects, making client-side data handling safer and more convenient.
-   **Reduced Integration Errors:** Strong typing and clear schemas minimize misunderstandings about data formats, reducing integration issues between client and server.

## Conclusion

`APIDataModels` (Pydantic models) are a cornerstone of the `llm-food` API's robustness and maintainability. They enforce data consistency, provide automatic validation and serialization, and serve as clear DTOs for all client-server communication. By defining the "shape" of our data, we prevent a wide class of common API errors and make the system easier to understand and extend.

In the next chapter, we'll see how these models are utilized by the [LLMFoodClient](llmfoodclient.mdc) to interact with the server API in a structured way.
