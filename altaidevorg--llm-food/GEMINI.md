# Chapter 4: SynchronousConversionService

In the [LLMFoodClient](llmfoodclient.mdc) chapter, we saw how a client application can make requests to the `llm-food` server for document conversion. This chapter dives into the server-side component responsible for handling these immediate, single-file conversion requests: the `SynchronousConversionService`.

## Motivation and Purpose

The `SynchronousConversionService` addresses the need for a centralized, reusable, and testable component that performs on-demand conversion of single documents or URL content to Markdown. When a client sends a file or URL to the `/convert` endpoints (detailed in [FastAPIServerEndpoints](fastapiserverendpoints.mdc)) and expects an immediate Markdown response, this service's logic is invoked.

Its key characteristics include:
- **Synchronous Interaction Model:** Clients make a request and block (wait) until the conversion is complete and the Markdown result is returned. This is suitable for interactive use cases or scenarios where immediate processing is required.
- **Dynamic Processor Selection:** It intelligently chooses the correct parsing/conversion library based on the input file's extension (e.g., PDF, DOCX, HTML).
- **Configurable PDF Strategy:** For PDF documents, it employs a specific [PDFProcessingStrategy (Synchronous)](pdfprocessingstrategy__synchronous_.mdc), which can be configured (e.g., Gemini, pymupdf4llm, pypdf2).
- **File Size Validation:** It incorporates logic to check file sizes against configured limits.
- **Centralized Logic:** It encapsulates the core single-file transformation logic, making the API endpoints cleaner and the conversion process itself easier to manage and test.

This service contrasts with the [BatchJobOrchestrator](batchjoborchestrator.mdc), which is designed for asynchronous processing of multiple files.

**Central Use Case:** A user uploads a `.docx` file via a web interface that calls the `POST /convert` API endpoint. The `FastAPIServerEndpoints` layer receives the request, validates the file size, and then invokes the `SynchronousConversionService` logic with the file content. The service identifies it as a DOCX file, uses the `mammoth` library to convert it to HTML, then `markdownify` to convert HTML to Markdown, and returns the Markdown text. The client receives this Markdown in the HTTP response.

While not a standalone class in the current codebase, the logic for the `SynchronousConversionService` is primarily encapsulated within the `_process_file_content` function and its helper processing functions (e.g., `_process_docx_sync`, `_process_pdf_pymupdf4llm_sync`) found in `llm_food/app.py`.

## Key Responsibilities and Mechanisms

### 1. Content Handling and Initial Processing
The service logic is typically invoked after the [FastAPIServerEndpoints](fastapiserverendpoints.mdc) layer has received an uploaded file or fetched content from a URL.

For file uploads (`POST /convert`):
```python
# llm_food/app.py (Simplified from convert_file_upload)
# async def convert_file_upload(file: UploadFile = File(...)):
#     ext = os.path.splitext(file.filename)[1].lower()
#     content = await file.read() # Read file content into bytes

#     # File size validation (see below)
#     # ...

#     pdf_backend_choice = get_pdf_backend() # Get configured PDF strategy

#     # Invoke the core service logic
#     texts_list = await _process_file_content(ext, content, pdf_backend_choice)

#     # Return ConversionResponse (see APIDataModels (Pydantic))
#     # ...
```
- The endpoint reads the file content into `bytes`.
- It determines the file extension and configured PDF backend.
- It then calls `_process_file_content`, which embodies the core of the `SynchronousConversionService`.

For URL conversions (`GET /convert`):
```python
# llm_food/app.py (Simplified from convert_url)
# async def convert_url(url: str = Query(...)):
#     # ... (fetch URL content into content_bytes using httpx) ...
#     # content_bytes = html_content.encode("utf-8")

#     # For HTML, trafilatura is used directly in the endpoint handler
#     # or _process_file_content could be extended for URLs.
#     extracted_text = trafilatura.extract(html_content, output_format="markdown")
#     texts_list = [extracted_text if extracted_text is not None else ""]
#     # ... return ConversionResponse ...
```
- The `/convert` GET endpoint currently handles HTML URL conversion directly using `trafilatura`. The `_process_file_content` function also includes logic for HTML files if they were uploaded.

### 2. File Size Validation
Before processing, file sizes are validated (primarily for uploads) to prevent resource exhaustion. This check occurs in the API endpoint handler before delegating to the core conversion logic.

```python
# llm_food/app.py (within convert_file_upload)
max_size = get_max_file_size_bytes() # From config
if max_size is not None and len(content) > max_size:
    raise HTTPException(
        status_code=413,
        detail=f"File size exceeds maximum allowed: {max_size / (1024 * 1024):.2f}MB."
    )
```
- `get_max_file_size_bytes()` retrieves the configured limit.
- If the `content` length exceeds this, an `HTTPException` is raised.

### 3. Dynamic Processor Selection and Execution (`_process_file_content`)
The heart of the service is the `_process_file_content` function. It acts as a dispatcher, selecting the appropriate processing function based on the file extension.

**Input:**
- `ext: str`: The file extension (e.g., `".pdf"`, `".docx"`).
- `content: bytes`: The raw byte content of the file.
- `pdf_backend_choice: str`: The configured PDF processing strategy (e.g., `"gemini"`, `"pymupdf4llm"`, `"pypdf2"`).

**Output:**
- `List[str]`: A list of strings, where each string is a chunk of converted Markdown (often one string per page for multi-page documents, or a single string for others).

**Simplified Structure of `_process_file_content`:**
```python
# llm_food/app.py
async def _process_file_content(
    ext: str, content: bytes, pdf_backend_choice: str
) -> List[str]:
    texts_list: List[str] = []
    if ext == ".pdf":
        # PDF processing logic (see details below)
        # ...
    elif ext == ".docx":
        texts_list = await asyncio.to_thread(_process_docx_sync, content)
    elif ext == ".rtf":
        texts_list = await asyncio.to_thread(_process_rtf_sync, content)
    elif ext == ".pptx":
        texts_list = await asyncio.to_thread(_process_pptx_sync, content)
    elif ext in [".html", ".htm"]:
        texts_list = await asyncio.to_thread(_process_html_sync, content)
    else:
        texts_list = ["Unsupported file type for synchronous conversion."]
    return texts_list
```
- The function uses `if/elif` to route based on `ext`.
- For most non-PDF types, it calls a specific synchronous processing helper function (e.g., `_process_docx_sync`) using `await asyncio.to_thread(...)`. This is crucial because FastAPI is an asynchronous framework, and running blocking I/O-bound or CPU-bound synchronous code directly in an `async` function would block the server's event loop. `asyncio.to_thread` executes the synchronous function in a separate thread pool.

#### Specific File Type Processors:

- **DOCX (`_process_docx_sync`):**
  ```python
  # llm_food/app.py
  def _process_docx_sync(content_bytes: bytes) -> List[str]:
      try:
          doc = BytesIO(content_bytes)
          doc_html = mammoth.convert_to_html(doc).value # mammoth converts DOCX to HTML
          doc_md = markdownify(doc_html).strip() # markdownify converts HTML to Markdown
          return [doc_md]
      except Exception as e:
          return [f"Error processing DOCX: {str(e)}"]
  ```
  - Uses `mammoth` to convert DOCX to HTML, then `markdownify` to get Markdown.

- **RTF (`_process_rtf_sync`):**
  ```python
  # llm_food/app.py
  def _process_rtf_sync(content_bytes: bytes) -> List[str]:
      try:
          # striprtf decodes and converts RTF to plain text
          return [rtf_to_text(content_bytes.decode("utf-8", errors="ignore"))]
      except Exception as e:
          return [f"Error processing RTF: {str(e)}"]
  ```
  - Uses `striprtf` to convert RTF to plain text.

- **PPTX (`_process_pptx_sync`):**
  ```python
  # llm_food/app.py
  def _process_pptx_sync(content_bytes: bytes) -> List[str]:
      try:
          prs = Presentation(BytesIO(content_bytes)) # python-pptx library
          slide_texts = []
          for slide in prs.slides: # Iterate through slides
              text_on_slide = "\n".join(
                  shape.text for shape in slide.shapes if hasattr(shape, "text") # Extract text from shapes
              )
              if text_on_slide: slide_texts.append(text_on_slide)
          return slide_texts if slide_texts else [""] # List of text content per slide
      except Exception as e:
          return [f"Error processing PPTX: {str(e)}"]
  ```
  - Uses `python-pptx` to extract text from each slide.

- **HTML (`_process_html_sync`):**
  ```python
  # llm_food/app.py
  def _process_html_sync(content_bytes: bytes) -> List[str]:
      try:
          # trafilatura extracts main content and converts to Markdown
          extracted_text = trafilatura.extract(
              content_bytes.decode("utf-8", errors="ignore"), output_format="markdown"
          )
          return [extracted_text if extracted_text is not None else ""]
      except Exception as e:
          return [f"Error processing HTML: {str(e)}"]
  ```
  - Uses `trafilatura` to extract the main content from HTML and convert it to Markdown.

### 4. PDF Processing Strategy Integration
For PDF files, `_process_file_content` delegates to a specific strategy based on `pdf_backend_choice`. This choice is determined by the `PDF_BACKEND` environment variable (see `llm_food/config.py`). The actual implementation of these strategies is covered in more detail in [PDFProcessingStrategy (Synchronous)](pdfprocessingstrategy__synchronous_.mdc).

```python
# llm_food/app.py (within _process_file_content for ext == ".pdf")
if pdf_backend_choice == "pymupdf4llm":
    texts_list = await asyncio.to_thread(_process_pdf_pymupdf4llm_sync, content)
elif pdf_backend_choice == "pypdf2":
    texts_list = await asyncio.to_thread(_process_pdf_pypdf2_sync, content)
elif pdf_backend_choice == "gemini":
    # Gemini strategy (async, involves API calls)
    pages = convert_from_bytes(content) # pdf2image
    # ... (prepare image data for Gemini) ...
    # ... (make async calls to Gemini API using client.aio.models.generate_content) ...
    # texts_list = [result.text for result in results]
    # (Simplified - see app.py for full Gemini logic)
else:
    texts_list = ["Invalid PDF backend specified."]
```
- **`pymupdf4llm` and `pypdf2`:** These use synchronous libraries, so their respective helper functions (`_process_pdf_pymupdf4llm_sync`, `_process_pdf_pypdf2_sync`) are called via `asyncio.to_thread`.
  ```python
  # llm_food/app.py
  def _process_pdf_pymupdf4llm_sync(content_bytes: bytes) -> List[str]:
      try:
          # pymupdf4llm processes PDF to Markdown page by page
          pymupdf_doc = pymupdf.Document(stream=content_bytes, filetype="pdf")
          page_data_list = to_markdown(pymupdf_doc, page_chunks=True)
          return [page_dict.get("text", "") for page_dict in page_data_list]
      except Exception as e:
          return [f"Error processing PDF with pymupdf4llm: {str(e)}"]
  ```
- **`gemini`:** This strategy is inherently asynchronous as it involves network calls to the Google Gemini API. The logic uses `pdf2image` to convert PDF pages to images, then makes asynchronous calls to Gemini for OCR and content generation for each page. This part of `_process_file_content` is `async` native.

The output `texts_list` (a list of strings) is then packaged into a `ConversionResponse` model (see [APIDataModels (Pydantic)](apidatamodels__pydantic_.mdc)) by the calling endpoint.

## Reusability and Testability

Although implemented as a collection of functions within `llm_food/app.py`, this "service" logic is designed for reusability.
- The main `_process_file_content` function can be called from anywhere that needs to convert file content synchronously. For instance, the [BatchJobOrchestrator](batchjoborchestrator.mdc) might use it for converting non-PDF files within a batch job.
- Each specific processing function (e.g., `_process_docx_sync`) is self-contained for its file type, making it individually testable with known inputs and outputs.

This encapsulation of conversion logic is a key design principle of the `llm-food` project, promoting modularity even within a single application file.

## Conclusion

The `SynchronousConversionService`, primarily embodied by the `_process_file_content` function and its helpers in `llm_food/app.py`, is the workhorse for all on-demand, single-file conversions in `llm-food`. It handles file type detection, dynamic selection of conversion tools (including configurable PDF strategies), and manages the execution of these tools in a way that's compatible with the FastAPI asynchronous environment. Its output is directly used to form the response for the `/convert` API endpoints.

Understanding this service is crucial for comprehending how `llm-food` performs its core task of transforming various document formats into Markdown for immediate consumption.

Next, we will explore how `llm-food` handles more complex, multi-file asynchronous operations with the [BatchJobOrchestrator](batchjoborchestrator.mdc).
