# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Development Workflow

Follow these steps in order when working on a task:

1. **Design** — Explore the codebase, understand the problem, and plan the implementation approach. Use plan mode for non-trivial tasks.
2. **Implement** — Write the code changes. Keep changes focused and avoid over-engineering.
3. **Run tests** — Run `./gradlew check` to verify all tests pass. *(Optional when running as Claude Code on web, since CI will catch failures.)*
4. **Commit** — Always show a summary of changes and wait for explicit user confirmation before committing.
5. **Squash commits and submit PR** — Squash all commits on the branch into a single commit, push, and create a PR via `gh pr create`.
6. **Watch CI build result** — CI posts build results as PR comments on failure. If the build fails, read the failure comment, fix the issue, and repeat from step 3.
7. **Ask user to approve and merge** — Once CI passes, ask the user to review, approve, and merge the PR.
8. **Publish** — NEVER publish via local `./gradlew publish*` commands. ALWAYS publish by creating and pushing a git tag, which triggers GitHub Actions to publish automatically: `git tag vX.Y.Z && git push origin vX.Y.Z`. Before publishing:
   1. Check existing versions: `gh api /users/johnsonlee/packages/maven/io.johnsonlee.graphite.graphite-cli/versions --jq '.[].name' | head -5`
   2. Determine the next version number based on existing versions
   3. Show the user the current latest version and proposed new version for confirmation
9. **Update docs** — After tagging a release, update documentation (README version references, etc.) to reflect the new version. This is a docs-only change — commit and push directly to `main` without a PR.

## Project Overview

Graphite is a graph-based static analysis framework for JVM bytecode. It provides a clean abstraction layer over [SootUp](https://github.com/soot-oss/SootUp) for building custom program analyses.

## Test Coverage Requirements

**Unit test line coverage for the entire project MUST be >= 98%.** When adding or modifying code, ensure sufficient tests are written to maintain this threshold.

## Build Commands

```bash
# Build all modules
./gradlew build

# Build specific module
./gradlew :graphite-core:build

# Run tests
./gradlew check

# Run a specific test class
./gradlew :graphite-sootup:test --tests "io.johnsonlee.graphite.sootup.UseCaseValidationTest"
```

## Key Abstractions

| Abstraction | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `Node` | Program element: constant, variable, parameter, return value, call site |
| `Edge` | Relationship: dataflow, call, type hierarchy |
| `Graph` | Unified program representation, supports traversal and queries |
| `ProjectLoader` | Interface for loading bytecode into Graph |
| `DataFlowAnalysis` | Backward/forward slice analysis |
| `GraphiteQuery` | Declarative query DSL |

## Usage

```kotlin
// Load bytecode
val graph = JavaProjectLoader(LoaderConfig(
    includePackages = listOf("com.example")
)).load(Path.of("/path/to/app.jar"))

// Query: find constants passed to specific methods
Graphite.from(graph).query {
    findArgumentConstants {
        method {
            declaringClass = "com.example.SomeClass"
            name = "someMethod"
            parameterTypes = listOf("java.lang.Integer")
        }
        argumentIndex = 0
    }
}

// Dataflow: backward slice from a node
val analysis = DataFlowAnalysis(graph)
val result = analysis.backwardSlice(nodeId)
result.constants()  // all constant values that flow to this node
```

## Dependency Management

Dependencies are managed via version catalog (`gradle/libs.versions.toml`).

## Publishing

This project publishes artifacts to GitHub Packages. Both manual and automated publishing are supported.

### Prerequisites

Configure GitHub credentials in `~/.gradle/gradle.properties`:

```properties
gpr.user=your-github-username
gpr.key=your-github-token
```

Token requires `write:packages` permission.

### Manual Publishing

Specify the version via command line property:

```bash
# Publish alpha version
./gradlew clean publishAllPublicationsToGitHubPackagesRepository -Pversion=1.1.1-alpha.1

# Publish release version
./gradlew clean publishAllPublicationsToGitHubPackagesRepository -Pversion=1.1.0
```

### Automated Publishing (GitHub Actions)

Publishing is triggered by creating a git tag. GitHub Actions automatically derives the version number from the tag name.

```bash
# Create and push a tag to trigger release
git tag v1.1.0
git push origin v1.1.0
```

### Using Published Artifacts

Add GitHub Packages repository to your project:

```kotlin
repositories {
    maven {
        url = uri("https://maven.pkg.github.com/johnsonlee/graphite")
        credentials {
            username = project.findProperty("gpr.user") as String? ?: System.getenv("GITHUB_ACTOR")
            password = project.findProperty("gpr.key") as String? ?: System.getenv("GITHUB_TOKEN")
        }
    }
}

dependencies {
    implementation("io.johnsonlee.graphite:graphite-core:1.2.0-beta.1")
    implementation("io.johnsonlee.graphite:graphite-sootup:1.2.0-beta.1")
}
```

### Release Workflow

Follow this progression when releasing versions:

| Stage | Version Format | Purpose |
|-------|----------------|---------|
| 1. Alpha | `x.y.z-alpha.n` | Internal testing during active development |
| 2. Beta | `x.y.z-beta.n` | Limited testing with early adopters |
| 3. RC | `x.y.z-rc.n` | Public testing, feature-complete |
| 4. Release | `x.y.z` | Production-ready stable release |

Example version progression:
```
0.0.1-alpha.2 → 0.0.1-beta.1 → 0.0.1-rc.1 → 0.0.1
```

## Implementation Learnings

### Type Hierarchy Analysis & Generic Type Tracking

When implementing nested generic type analysis (e.g., `ApiResponse<PageData<User>>`), several key insights emerged:

#### 1. JVM Type Erasure Requires Constructor Analysis
- Generic type information is erased at runtime in JVM bytecode
- To discover actual type arguments, analyze **constructor calls** and trace argument types
- Example: `new L1<>(l2)` where `l2` is type `L2` → infer `L1<L2>`

#### 2. Depth Budget Management
- Multiple analysis phases (field analysis, generic analysis) consume depth budget
- Each level of nesting consumes ~2x depth (once for fields, once for generics)
- **Rule of thumb**: Set `maxDepth ≈ 2.5 × desired_nesting_levels`
- Default `maxDepth=10` supports ~5 levels; use `maxDepth=25` for 10 levels

#### 3. Caching Considerations
- Type structure caching uses `"${className}:${methodSignature}"` as key
- Cache doesn't include depth, so early analysis at higher depth can affect later queries
- Be careful with analysis order when multiple methods analyze the same types

#### 4. Cross-Method Field Tracking
- Fields assigned in one method may be returned in another
- Build a global field assignment map at initialization: `Map<"class#field", Set<assignedTypes>>`
- Scan all `CallSiteNode` for setter patterns and `FieldNode` for direct assignments

#### 5. Inheritance Hierarchy for Object Fields
- Child classes may assign to parent class Object fields
- Use heuristics when type hierarchy edges aren't available:
  - Same package suggests possible inheritance
  - Check for setter calls from child to parent's methods

#### 6. Test Depth Verification
- When testing N-level nesting, create wrapper classes L1 through LN
- Measure actual depth reached vs expected to catch depth budget issues early
- Example test pattern:
  ```kotlin
  val maxDepthReached = measureTypeDepth(result.returnStructures.first())
  assertTrue(maxDepthReached >= 10, "Should reach 10 levels")
  ```

### Memory Optimization with Primitive Collections

When optimizing for memory efficiency in graph-based data structures:

#### 1. NodeId: String → Int
- String-based IDs use ~40 bytes per node (object header + char array + length)
- Int-based IDs use 4 bytes per node
- **Savings: 90% reduction in NodeId storage**

#### 2. Graph Maps: HashMap → Fastutil Int2ObjectOpenHashMap
- HashMap<Integer, V> uses ~64 bytes per entry (Entry object + boxing)
- Int2ObjectOpenHashMap uses ~24-32 bytes per entry (no boxing, open addressing)
- **Savings: 50-60% reduction in map overhead**

#### 3. Benchmark Results (500K nodes)
```
NodeId:     40 bytes → 20 bytes per node (50% savings)
Graph maps: 64 bytes → 31 bytes per entry (51% savings)
Total:      63% memory reduction for large applications
```

### Feature Flags & Special Case Handling Anti-Patterns

When adding special handling for specific cases (like collection factory methods), several pitfalls emerged:

#### 1. Testing "Bug as Feature" Trap
- A test that validates "feature X disabled should NOT find results" may actually be testing broken behavior
- **Correct approach**: Regression tests should verify "scenarios that worked before still work after changes"
- Example: Testing `expandCollections=false` shouldn't find constants was actually validating a bug

#### 2. Early Return Breaks Generic Traversal
```kotlin
// BAD: Special case with early return breaks default behavior
if (isSpecialCase) {
    if (config.enableSpecialHandling) {
        // do special handling
    }
    return  // <- This breaks normal traversal when flag is false!
}

// GOOD: Special case only adds behavior, doesn't remove default
if (isSpecialCase && config.enableSpecialHandling) {
    // do special handling
    return  // Return only when special handling is active
}
// Default traversal continues for all other cases
```

#### 3. Config Flags Add Complexity Without Value
- Before adding a config flag, verify the default behavior actually needs changing
- The original backward slice already traversed all incoming edges correctly
- Adding `expandCollections` flag created complexity and introduced bugs
- **Rule**: If the default behavior is correct, don't add flags to disable it

#### 4. Test Coverage Blind Spots
- Original `FeatureFlagAnalysisTest` tested direct constant passing: `getOption(1001)`
- Real-world usage included collection patterns: `getOption(List.of(AbKey.KEY))`
- Bug only surfaced in production use, not in tests
- **Rule**: Test coverage should mirror real-world usage patterns

### Why `buildGraph()` Is Not Parallelized

After reducing `SootUpAdapter.buildGraph()` from 6 passes to 2, parallel processing of classes within each pass was evaluated and rejected.

#### Where time is spent

| Phase | Per-class cost | Notes |
|-------|---------------|-------|
| `processTypeHierarchyForClass` | Trivial | A few map insertions per class |
| `extractEnumValues` | Moderate | `<clinit>` parsing, enum classes only |
| `processMethod` | **Heavy** | Statement graph traversal, node/edge creation — the bottleneck |
| `processClassFieldsForClass` | Light | Iterate declared fields |
| `processEndpointsForClass` | Light | Annotation reflection |
| `processJacksonAnnotationsForClass` | Light | Annotation reflection |

#### Why not parallel

1. **The bottleneck is upstream.** SootUp's `JavaView` construction (class resolution, body interception) dominates total load time. `buildGraph()` itself is a small fraction — parallelizing it yields marginal wall-clock improvement.

2. **Memory regression.** `DefaultGraph.Builder` uses fastutil `Int2ObjectOpenHashMap` for nodes and edges (51% memory savings over `HashMap`). There is no concurrent fastutil equivalent — parallelism would require falling back to `ConcurrentHashMap<Int, *>`, undoing the memory optimization that matters most for large applications.

3. **Shared mutable state.** Six adapter-level maps (`localNodes`, `fieldNodes`, `parameterNodes`, `constantNodes`, `methodReturnNodes`, `allocationNodes`) are written during method processing. `constantNodes` deduplication (`getOrPut` + `graphBuilder.addNode` side-effect) is particularly hard to make atomic without locking.

4. **Complexity vs. gain.** Thread-safe constant deduplication, concurrent edge list building, and race condition testing add significant complexity for a phase that processes ~200 filtered classes in under a second on typical workloads.

#### If revisited

If profiling reveals `buildGraph()` as a bottleneck on very large codebases, the preferred approach would be **per-class builders merged at end** (each class gets an independent builder, results merged sequentially after all classes are processed) rather than concurrent shared state. This avoids thread-safety issues but requires handling cross-class constant deduplication at merge time.
