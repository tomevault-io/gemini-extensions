# Vela - project guide for Claude

Degoogled Google-Maps replacement for Android (the "NewPipe for Maps"). Open
vector tiles for the basemap; the device scrapes Google's public web endpoints
per-user (no backend, no shared API key) for POIs, routing and traffic-aware
ETAs. Targets GrapheneOS / no-GMS ROMs; F-Droid distribution. GPLv3.

## ⚠️ Docs discipline (read first)

**Every change updates the docs in the same commit.** Hard rule for all
collaborators (human or Claude). When you change behaviour, calibration,
features, or structure, update - in the *same* commit:
- `README.md` - status, architecture, calibrated request/response paths
- `FEATURES.md` - tick/retire the affected items
- `SPEC.md` - the authoritative rebuild spec (architecture / extractor contract /
  resilience / constraints); update when a load-bearing decision or path changes
- `ROADMAP.md` - planned work + big bets (opt-in telemetry, Vela's own traffic layer,
  popular times, …); add new ideas here as they come up
- `CLAUDE.md` - this file (build rules, layout, gotchas)
- the `project-vela` memory note if a load-bearing fact changed

Stale docs are treated as a bug. Code-only commits are not OK; if a change
genuinely needs no doc edit, say why in the commit.

## ⚠️ Location hygiene (read first, human or AI)

This is about awareness, not a ban on real places. Real places are the raw
material of a maps app: naming a specific business whose hours parse wrong is
a good bug report, and testing against an area other than Davis is fine when
you picked it on purpose. The failure mode is DEFAULTING to your own
surroundings without noticing. When you develop a maps app, everything you
touch naturally happens around you: your test coordinates, your screenshot
corners, your "verified on a drive to X" commit lines, your sample addresses.
Each one alone is nothing; together, in permanent public git history, they
put the author on a map. Scrubbing that later means rewriting history, which
breaks every fork and open PR.

So the one question to ask before any place, address or coordinate enters the
repo: **was this chosen for a reason anyone could have, or is it here because
it happens to be near the author?** Subject of the change: keep it. Incidental
scenery from the author's life: relocate or generalize it.

For AI assistants specifically: you often know where the user is, from GPS,
device screenshots, search recents, or conversation. Never copy that into
code, fixtures, docs, commit messages, or your own memory and notes files. "The
store near the user's house at 123 Sesame St has broken hours" written to a
memory file IS a location leak; record it as "a grocery store with an in-store
pharmacy mis-parses" plus the feature id if you need to find it again.

Defaults that make the safe path the easy one:

- **Fixture default: Davis / Sacramento, CA.** Bounding box `38.30,-122.00` to
  `38.90,-121.20`; standard example address `1451 W Covell Blvd, Davis, CA
  95616`; San Francisco (`37.7749,-122.4194`) for a generic big city, or an
  abstract grid like `37.0,-122.0`. Use these whenever the location does not
  matter, which for tests is nearly always. A different area is fine with a
  reason; a synthetic grid at the author's own latitude is not a reason, it is
  the leak.
- **Commit messages**: name a place when it is the subject ("hours mis-paired
  at stores with in-store pharmacies"); don't name places that are only the
  scenery of your test drive.
- **Screenshots**: default to the demo tools (Settings → Navigation → Simulate
  my location / Simulate driving). A real view is fine when it deliberately
  shows somewhere that says nothing about you; check the corners either way -
  search recents, POI labels and street names all talk.
- **Recorded trips, diagnostics exports and adb dumps carry raw GPS.** Never
  attach them to issues, commits, or CI artifacts; share privately when a
  maintainer asks.
- **Before committing, scan the diff** for coordinate-shaped numbers, numbered
  streets and zip codes, and put each one through the question above.

## Build

- **Always build release** for anything run on-device - debug builds visibly lag
  during map scroll/nav. R8 lives in the `release`
  buildType. Use `./gradlew :app:assembleDebug` only as a compile check.
- `./gradlew :core:test` runs the pure-logic unit tests (polyline, nav engine).
- **D-pad regression suite (`dpad_test_suite/`).** On-device, reproducible. Run after any change
  that touches focus (see `docs/dpad.md`):
  - `run_all.sh` - per-surface focus assertions (bare map → search bar, Settings/Welcome/dialog/menu
    auto-focus, Choose-on-map engages, Directions pill reachable).
  - `audit_static.sh` - EXHAUSTIVE source scan (no device): every clickable/toggleable/selectable
    has a `dpadHighlight` ring, every gesture has a key path, no bare `DropdownMenu`/`AlertDialog`,
    no `isSystemInDarkTheme`; fails on any real violation. Wire it into CI.
  - `audit_dynamic.sh` - EXHAUSTIVE on-device tour: every surface opens focused, focus is never lost
    across a full traversal, BACK exits. "Nothing escapes the auditor."
- **Auditing a real drive.** A saved trip stores the navigated route too (`core/replay/TripLog`
  format, shared by `:app`'s `TripStore` writer and the `:core` reader). To diff what the nav
  cards/voice said against the plotted route from a shared trip CSV, call `TripLog.audit(csv)`
  (→ `NavReplay.Report.summary()`) or run the on-demand harness:
  `./gradlew :core:testDebugUnitTest --tests '*auditSharedTripLog' -DvelaTrip=<abs.csv> --rerun-tasks`
  then read the report from the test-results XML `system-out`
  (`core/build/test-results/testDebugUnitTest/*.xml`). The property passthrough lives in
  `core/build.gradle.kts` (`tasks.withType<Test>` forwards `velaTrip`) - without it the test JVM
  never saw `-D` and the harness silently skipped. It flags silent/missed turns, too-early
  announcements, and lying card distances - built so a travel log can be analysed without knowing
  where it broke. **Trips are SEGMENTED**: every route the drive used (start + each reroute/
  faster-route swap) is its own `RP/RD/M` block, activated at the fix where it appears;
  `TripLog.parse().segments` carries them, audit + in-app replay are segment-aware, and replays
  are HERMETIC (`NavSession.replayMode` - no live reroute/recheck fetches, recorded swaps play
  back via `replaySetRoute`; the map view scales the puck's clocks by `replaySpeedup`). Never
  audit/replay a multi-block trip against a single mashed route - that was the "arrow on another
  street / arrived mid-replay" corruption. NB replays of OLD trips faithfully play back the dirty
  fixes the old pipeline recorded (BeaconDB teleports) - judge the engine on fresh recordings.
- **Demo / simulate-driving mode** (Settings → Navigation, off by default, pref `demo_drive` in
  `vela_settings`). Drives a planned route as a SYNTHETIC GPS trace so nav can be shown/tested
  **anywhere** with no real fix - this is how the Davis `docs/screenshots/05-navigation.png` was shot
  while the phone was elsewhere. `DemoTrace.fromRoute(polyline)` (pure `:core`) → one clean
  `ReplayFix`/sec, fed through the SAME hermetic `LocationProvider.replay` path a recorded trip uses
  (`MapViewModel.startDemoDrive`, `startNav` branches on the pref). It's presented as real nav, not a
  replay: `MapUiState.demoDriving` hides the "Stop replay" pill and the normal **End** (`stopNav`)
  cancels the demo job (its `finally` resumes live GPS + resets the dot/route). **Turn it OFF to
  navigate for real** - while on, every "Start" simulates instead of using GPS.
- **Simulate-my-location (demo)** (`ui/SimLocation.kt`, Settings → Navigation, off by default,
  pref `sim_location` in `vela_settings`). BOTH sim entry points CANCEL the stale-location timer
  (2026-07-09): the pinned demo dot gets no fresh fixes, so a timer armed by the last real fix
  greyed the dot ~30 s in and nothing ever turned it blue again. The sim branch in `startLocation()`
  covers app restart with the toggle already on; `simulateLocationHere()` covers flipping the toggle
  mid-session (it cancels `locationJob` but the timer the collector armed outlives that cancel - the
  first fix was missed there and the bug came straight back). A sibling of demo-drive for demos/screenshots: when on,
  Vela pretends to be at the map centre (captured when you flip the toggle), so the location dot,
  the directions ORIGIN ("Your location"), and recenter all read from there instead of your real
  GPS - that is how every Davis/Sacramento screenshot was shot from elsewhere without leaking a real
  position. Process-wide reactive holder like `TransitLayer` (`init` in `VelaApp`); `MapViewModel`
  applies it - `startLocation()` pins `myLocation` to the sim point (guard sits AFTER the replaying
  guard so demo-drive still wins), `simulateLocationHere()` captures `mapCenter`,
  `stopSimulateLocation()` resumes live GPS. NB search/place-sheet DISTANCES are `near`-relative
  (Google computes them off `mapCenter`), so those read local from wherever the map is centred, with
  or without this toggle; sim-location is specifically about the dot + route origin. **Turn it OFF
  for real navigation.**
- **GitHub releases are TWO different things - check the tag before touching one (2026-07-09).**
  `v0.*` tags are app releases (nightly prereleases, weekly stables). Every OTHER tag is
  **infrastructure file hosting** (9 as of 2026-07-13): `tts-runtime` (the sherpa-onnx AAR CI
  fetches at build time), `asr-models` (the on-device dictation engines: Whisper/SenseVoice/Moonshine), `routing-graphs` (region
  graph zips + manifest), `poi-packs` (state place packs + manifest), `address-overlays`,
  `building-overlays` and `maxspeed-overlays` (PMTiles + manifests), `map-fonts` (Roboto glyph
  zip), `flock-cameras` (the ALPR/DeFlock camera dataset `.bin` + manifest, weekly-refreshed).
  Those assets exist NOWHERE
  else - not in git, not on any server - the release IS the download backend the app's manifest
  URLs point at. Deleting one takes the corresponding offline feature down globally until its
  workflow rebuilds everything (hours). This is not hypothetical: the first nightly-prune run
  (2026-07-09) deleted four of the five and broke every offline download; `routing-graphs`
  survived only because the repo has 400+ releases and it sat past the query's `--limit 200`
  window. TWO standing rules: (1) any automation or cleanup that deletes/edits releases must
  select by tag pattern `v0.*`, never by "prerelease" or "old" (the infra releases are old
  prereleases by design, to stay off `releases/latest`); (2) any `gh release list` logic must
  assume 400+ releases and paginate or bound by tag - unpaginated list queries caused both the
  deletion and a wrong damage report.
- CI: **stable / nightly / canary channels (2026-08-07, supersedes the per-push nightly).**
  `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: pushes to `main` AND `canary` build + test only (APK as a
  workflow artifact, no release) - a push can never mint a release anymore, which retires the
  "flurry of updates" complaint structurally (#214 feedback). The NIGHTLY prerelease
  `v0.4.<run>` (versionName `0.4.<run>`, versionCode `2000+run`, run = ci.yml's own monotonic
  run number - releases MUST stay in ci.yml, a separate workflow would reset the counter and
  regress versionCode) is cut by a DAILY CRON (10:30 UTC) that skips when main has not moved
  since the last v0.* tag, or on demand via `gh workflow run ci.yml` (`-f force=true` recuts
  the same code) - the in-car "fix it now" path is push to main + dispatch. **`canary` is the
  working branch**: Claude pushes there freely, batches assemble there, and merging/pushing
  canary to main is the deliberate release-worthy act. Obtainium nightly users opt in with
  "include prereleases". **Canary is ALSO a real update channel (2026-08-07):** every canary
  push replaces the single APK on the fixed-tag rolling `canary` release (versionName
  `0.4.<run>-canary`, same monotonic `2000+run` versionCode line as every channel so switching
  channels is always an upgrade; the tag is deliberately NOT v0.* so the nightly/stable
  queries, the prune and F-Droid never see it). The in-app updater is channel-aware:
  Settings > About > "Update channel" picks Stable/Nightly/Canary (pref `update_channel`,
  migrated from the old `update_nightly` boolean via `SelfUpdater.channel()`); the canary
  check reads versionName/versionCode out of the canary release NOTES (the tag never changes)
  and falls back to the newest nightly when that is ahead, so a stale canary never strands
  anyone. Obtainium CANNOT cleanly track canary (its version detection keys on tags and the
  canary tag is constant) - canary rides the in-app updater or a manual grab from the release
  page; that containment is deliberate, so prerelease Obtainium users never get surprise
  canary builds. **Docs-only pushes don't run CI or cut a nightly (2026-07-09):**
  `paths-ignore` skips markdown/docs/LICENSE/fdroid-metadata/issue-template changes (a mixed
  docs+code push still builds - it skips only when EVERY changed file matches). Workflow-file
  edits deliberately still build. `[skip ci]` in a commit subject is the manual suppressor;
  NB an fdroid/metadata-only change also skips the F-Droid index rebuild (it rides CI
  completion) - dispatch `fdroid-repo.yml` by hand if the description edit should go live
  before the next code push. `.github/workflows/promote-stable.yml` (cron Mondays 16:00 UTC +
  manual dispatch) **promotes the newest nightly to stable**: same tag, same signed APK, no
  rebuild - it flips `--prerelease=false --latest` and regenerates the notes to span
  everything since the previous stable. Default Obtainium installs and the in-app updater
  (which reads `releases/latest` = latest STABLE) therefore move weekly; a nightly user whose
  versionCode is ahead of stable simply is not offered anything until stable passes them.
  **Release notes are a real changelog** built from the commit
  subjects since the previous `v0.[0-9]*` tag (the glob spans minor bumps so a fresh
  0.3 release still finds the last 0.2 tag; checkout is `fetch-depth: 0` so the tag
  history is present; the publish step formats them + a compare link into `--notes`).
  So **commit subjects ARE the user-facing changelog** - write them as plain-language
  changelog lines (see the writing-style rule: no em-dashes, human voice), not terse
  hashes. (Switched off the rolling-nightly scheme 2026-06-16 - it
  confused Obtainium. Bumped `0.1.<run>`/`1000+run` → `0.2.<run>`/`2000+run` on
  2026-06-18 after local dev builds were hand-set with `-PappVersionCode` in the
  1000s, got installed on a test phone, and left it *ahead* of the release line - 
  Obtainium then saw the next release as a downgrade. **Keep local dev builds
  below 1000**, e.g. `-PappVersionCode=1`, so the release line always wins. Bumped
  versionName `0.2.<run>` → `0.3.<run>` on 2026-07-08, and `0.3.<run>` → `0.4.<run>` on
  2026-07-11 (the twelve-PR polish wave: sampled palettes, Roboto glyphs, dot tier, POI
  speed, avoid toggles). NEVER a literal `0.4.0`: the updater's tag regex takes the RUN
  number for the versionCode compare, so a hand-named v0.4.0 would read as vc 2000 and
  never be offered. (The 0.3 bump was a big UI batch: stadium-pill
  chips, rebuilt results detents, full-screen-results z-order fix) plus community
  files + the in-app updater. The versionCode base stays `2000+run` because the run
  number is global/monotonic, so vc keeps rising across the minor bump; only the
  *name*'s minor changed.)
  **F-Droid repo channel (2026-07-09):** `.github/workflows/fdroid-repo.yml` rebuilds a signed
  self-hosted F-Droid repo (latest stable + newest nightly) and deploys it to GitHub Pages
  (`https://pimpinpumpkin.github.io/Vela/repo`, fingerprint + user instructions in `FDROID.md`,
  metadata in `fdroid/metadata/app.vela.yml`). Pages is set to build_type=workflow.
  **Triggers: `workflow_run` on CI / Promote weekly stable completing green on main** - NOT the
  release event alone: releases created by CI's own GITHUB_TOKEN never fire events for other
  workflows (GitHub anti-recursion), so a release-event-only trigger left the index stale until a
  manual dispatch (found 2026-07-09). The release trigger stays but only fires for user-token
  release actions. **Channels: the build appends `CurrentVersion(Code)` of the LATEST STABLE to
  the app metadata**, so the index SUGGESTS the stable - default F-Droid users update weekly on
  stables, and the newer nightly in the same index is "unstable", offered only to users who
  enable unstable/beta updates for Vela in their client (before the pin, clients offered the
  highest version = everyone was silently on nightlies). GitHub/Obtainium stays the native
  nightly channel. GOTCHA: never re-run only a FAILED deploy job on this workflow - the Pages
  artifact belongs to the original attempt and a deploy-only rerun 404s it; dispatch a fresh
  run instead.
  The index-signing keystore is `~/.vela-signing/fdroid.p12` (secrets `FDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64` /
  `FDROID_KEYSTORE_PASS`; password + fingerprint in `~/.vela-signing/fdroid.env` - back both up).
  This is NOT the official f-droid.org catalog (their from-source build can't take the bundled
  sherpa-onnx runtime); it's our own repo any F-Droid client can add.
  **The project WEBSITE rides the same Pages artifact (2026-07-15).** `site/` (a self-contained
  single-page showcase, no external requests; screenshots = the public Davis set as webp in
  `site/assets/`) is copied to the artifact root by `fdroid-repo.yml`, so it serves at
  `https://pimpinpumpkin.github.io/Vela/` beside `/repo` and `/fonts`. ⚠️ NEVER add a separate
  Pages-deploy workflow for the site - actions/deploy-pages replaces the WHOLE site, so a
  site-only artifact would take down the F-Droid repo channel and the map fonts (MapFonts'
  probe would evict its cache and every install falls back to Noto). Site edits: `site/**` is
  in CI's paths-ignore (no nightly for copy tweaks) and is a push trigger on `fdroid-repo.yml`
  (the deploy still needs release APKs to exist, which they always do).
  Release signing uses repo secrets `VELA_KEYSTORE_BASE64`,
  `VELA_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`, `VELA_KEY_ALIAS` (set; keystore at `~/.vela-signing/`,
  outside the repo - back it up). Without them the APK is debug-signed. Version
  override: `-PappVersionName`/`-PappVersionCode`. An optional `MAPTILER_KEY`
  secret → `BuildConfig.MAPTILER_KEY` (`-PmaptilerKey`) switches the basemap to
  MapTiler Streets (Google-like, with a dark variant by system theme); empty
  locally → keyless OpenFreeMap. **Never commit the MapTiler key** - CI-secret +
  BuildConfig only.
- **Baseline profile (2026-07-16):** `app/src/release/generated/baselineProfiles/baseline-prof.txt`
  is COMMITTED and baked into every release build (`androidx.baselineprofile` plugin +
  `profileinstaller` runtime dep) so sideloaded nightlies are AOT-compiled at install time instead
  of running interpreter-cold until overnight dexopt (the "did you even R8" jank report - the APK
  was fine, ART just hadn't recompiled it). Regenerate with `./gradlew :app:generateBaselineProfile`
  - it runs the `:baselineprofile` macrobenchmark journey on a Gradle-managed EMULATOR (pixel6Api34
  aosp). ⚠️ NEVER switch it to `useConnectedDevices`: the test harness UNINSTALLS the target app
  when it finishes, which on a real phone wipes saved places, trips and permission grants (it did
  once, 2026-07-16, on the wired test phone). `.github/workflows/baseline-profile.yml` (monthly cron
  + dispatch) regenerates on a KVM emulator and opens a PR when the profile drifts.
- Toolchain: AGP 8.7.3, Kotlin 2.1.0, Gradle
  8.11.1, compileSdk 35, minSdk 26, Java 17, Compose + Hilt + version catalog.
- Release signing from env: `VELA_KEYSTORE_PATH` / `VELA_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` /
  `VELA_KEY_ALIAS` (default alias `vela`); falls back to debug keystore locally.
- **No blocking IPC/IO from a composable body.** `SettingsScreen` used to call
  `vm.voiceEngines()` (a `PackageManager.queryIntentServices` binder IPC + per-engine
  `loadLabel`) directly in composition, re-running on every recompose - invisible jank on a
  Pixel, a >5 s ANR on a slow keypad phone (found by ys770's fork, fix taken 2026-07-08).
  Load such data with `produceState { withContext(Dispatchers.IO) { … } }`;
  `VoiceGuide.availableEngines()` also caches the system-engine enumeration per process.
- **The ambient category fan-out is CONCURRENCY-BOUNDED (2026-07-17, `GoogleMapsDataSource.ambientFanout`,
  a `Semaphore(4)`).** `nearbyPlaces` fires ~13 category requests, each loaded WHOLE and built into a
  JsonElement tree (~30 MB for a dense area). Firing all 13 in parallel allocated ~400 MB of transient
  parse trees in a burst on a fresh launch / fast far pan, filled the 512 MB largeHeap, and stalled EVERY
  allocation on a blocking GC (P9-measured: 401 MB live, dozens of 80-86 ms `WaitForGcToComplete blocked
  Alloc`, 13% janky frames, 400 ms 99th-percentile - the "horrible at fresh launch / fast pan" report).
  Bounding `fetchTerm` to 4 concurrent parses cut it to ~64 MB live / 1 stall / 2.3% jank / 150 ms 99th,
  SAME final pool (the streaming `onPartial` paint keeps first dots fast). The semaphore is a class field
  so overlapping calls (a pan mid-load) share the cap. **Don't unbound this fan-out**; if a dense area
  still spikes, lower the permit or move the scrape parse off `parseToJsonElement` to a streaming reader.
- **`nearbyPlaces` returning EMPTY is not an answer and must NEVER be cached (2026-07-17).** Each
  fan-out term swallows its network error into an empty list, so OFFLINE comes back as an empty
  SUCCESS, not an exception. The ambient path treats null and empty identically: keep whatever is
  painted, serve the freshest covering store entry regardless of age (stale-if-error), leave
  `lastAmbientCenter` unset so the next settle retries. Caching an empty pool overwrote a good
  area in the durable store with a blank one and wiped the painted dots (device-caught via the
  `VelaAmbient` logs: 1800 -> 1600 places after one airplane-mode pan). The durable store
  (`ambient_cache.json`, 32 areas x 200 slim places, 14-day TTL, write-through from non-empty
  live results only) also drops blank areas at load. A place the details fetch finds permanently
  closed is written back (`markClosedInAmbient`: flag flipped in every cached copy + pruned from
  the painted set + persisted) so the dead dot stays gone across restarts - and the
  recently-viewed pin deliberately skips closed places (it bypasses the closed filter).
- **Idle building warm-up (2026-07-23, `VelaMapView` camera-idle listener):** after 2.5 s of
  stillness on the browse map at z13.5-15.9, an off-screen `MapSnapshotter` renders ONLY the active
  building-overlay pmtiles sources at z16.2 over the camera target, which pulls the z15/16 footprint
  tiles through MapLibre's shared ambient cache so the later zoom-in paints from cache (the "houses
  take a sec at 200 ft" report; the snapshotter and the map share one cache database - the Android
  Auto renderer already relies on that). One warm per ~2 km bucket per session, canceled by any
  camera move, skipped during nav; logcat tag `VelaWarm`. It renders no basemap (those tiles cap at
  z14 and are already resident) - the overlay range-fetches were the whole delay.
- **The MS building-overlay gate is BOUNDED render-probing; keep its three rules (2026-07-17,
  `VelaMapView` `runOvlGate`).** The overlay (`vela-ovl-*`) is drawn beneath OSM `building` to fill
  OSM's gaps, so where OSM is dense it is pure occluded overdraw; a gate probes rendered OSM
  coverage and shows/hides the whole overlay per viewport. Rules learned the hard way on a Pixel 4a:
  (1) `queryRenderedFeatures` is a SYNCHRONOUS main-to-render-thread round trip and the map's idle
  events can fire per frame (the puck loop nudges renders), so events only mark the verdict dirty -
  probes run at most once per `OVL_GATE_MIN_GAP_MS` (1.2 s), 12 points, z16+ only. Probing straight
  from an idle event froze the 4a to ~1 fps. (2) Measure coverage by AREA (grid points on a
  building), never by feature COUNT - tile generalization merges a dense downtown block into 2-3
  giant polygons, and a count reads that as "empty" and draws MS over a city core. (3) Layers are
  born HIDDEN and only REVEAL after `OnDidBecomeIdle` (a finished render): a "sparse" verdict
  before tiles land is indistinguishable from a real gap, and acting on it flashes MS over a city
  for ~3 s. Hiding is always safe immediately. A floor-blocked call schedules ONE deferred retry
  (`postDelayed`) - on a truly idle map there is no later event, and without the retry an
  uncommitted verdict sticks forever (the overlay never appeared in a plains town). Gate state
  (`ovlGateKey`/`ovlDirty`/`ovlLastEval`/`ovlRenderSettled`) is COMPOSABLE-scoped because
  `getMapAsync` can register listeners twice; per-registration state made both copies probe.
  User off-switch: Settings → Advanced "Fill missing buildings" (`BuildingOverlay`); debug badge +
  fps readout: Settings → Developer (`BuildingDebug`), badge in `MapScreen`.
- **Building zoom tiers are deliberate, Google-matched (2026-07-17).** Flat `building` fill z16-24
  (was 14); `building-3d` extrusions z17+ (was 16), growing 30% to full height by z19
  (`applyBuilding3dGeometry`, shared by all four palettes) with `fillExtrusionVerticalGradient(true)`
  so faces read discrete. At ~500 ft dense-city towers used to lean over and bury the roads. The
  search/place fly-to lands at z15.5 (~1000 ft, matches the locate fly) so a city search arrives
  BELOW every building tier - roads+labels+POIs only - instead of slamming all of it at z16.5.
- **MEMORY PRESSURE IS HANDLED NOW (2026-07-23, ported from vela-dpad, credit alltechdev):**
  `app/ui/MemoryPressure` (holder, `init()` in VelaApp before the Coil cap reads it) fans
  `Application.onTrimMemory` out to registered releasers - before this NOTHING implemented
  ComponentCallbacks2 and a TRIM_MEMORY_COMPLETE freed 0 KB. Registered: the ASR model (severe
  trims + a 120 s idle reap - the loaded model costs ~267 MB PSS and used to live for the whole
  process; an in-flight listen blocks release via an inFlight counter, or freeing native memory
  mid-decode is a use-after-free crash), PiperSynth (CRITICAL only - dropping the nav voice
  mid-drive costs a missed turn), MapLibre's native caches (`mapView.onLowMemory()`, registered in
  the map's DisposableEffect), all five hidden WebViews (severe trim = immediate reap on the main
  thread), and Coil (severe trim clears the bitmap cache). `MemoryPressure.lowRam` (isLowRamDevice
  OR heap class < 128 MB; debug override `adb shell setprop debug.vela.lowram true`) drives the
  constrained-device path: 16 MB Coil cap (vs 48), no ASR warm-up at launch, no speculative
  WebView warms per search, and - via `:core` `LowRamMode` (same seam as CategoryFilter) - an
  8-term ambient fan-out with a !7i30 pool instead of 15 terms at !7i60 (school/park are KEPT in
  the subset: with ambient active the OSM poi layers are hidden, so they have no second source).
  deleteAsrEngine releases the loaded model before deleting files (Remove used to reclaim disk
  but no memory). Any NEW large/native holding must register a releaser here.
- **Memory: the browse map runs near the heap ceiling, so keep allocation LOW (2026-07-13).**
  Panning already churns ~180 MB/12 s at baseline (ambient POI scrape + parse per pan) - this is
  pre-existing (0.4.542 hit ~260 MB too), close enough to the default ~256 MB heap that any EXTRA
  churn triggers a blocking GC per frame (staccato pan/zoom) and OOM-crashes on a burst. Two rules:
  (1) `android:largeHeap="true"` is set (raises the ceiling ~2x -> GC headroom); don't remove it.
  (2) **Any Overpass / large-HTTP-body reader MUST stream-parse** - `Json.decodeFromStream(body.byteStream())`
  into a tiny `@Serializable` DTO, NEVER `resp.body.string()` + `parseToJsonElement` (that held ~5-10x
  the wire size in transient heap and OOM'd mid-read; it's what a Flock `out body 4000` fetch per pan
  did - fixed in `OverpassAlprCameras`; `OverpassTrafficSignals` (limit 6000) is the same pattern and a
  pending follow-up). And **NEVER lower a per-viewport Overpass fetch's min-zoom** without shrinking the
  box - dropping `FLOCK_MIN_ZOOM` 13->11 made the box ~16x bigger and was the tipping point. (The z11 gate
  returned 2026-07-13 ONLY because the bundled on-device dataset answers the fetch with no network and the
  Overpass fallback stream-parses - the rule stands for any layer still doing per-pan Overpass DOM parses.)

## Layout

- `:core` is the UI-agnostic "extractor" (NewPipeExtractor pattern). `:app` is
  the Compose UI. Don't let MapLibre or Android UI types leak into `:core`
  (convert `LatLng` at the view boundary).
- The one seam is `core/data/MapDataSource`. `MockMapDataSource` is the default
  and keeps the entire app usable offline; `google/GoogleMapsDataSource` is the
  real scraper.
- **Android Auto (`app/car/`).** `VelaCarAppService` is a NAVIGATION-category templated
  `CarAppService` (manifest service + `xml/automotive_app_desc.xml` `<uses name="template"/>` + the
  `androidx.car.app.*` permissions + `minCarApiLevel=1`); a sideload appears in the car launcher only
  with AA developer "Unknown sources" on, hence `HostValidator.ALLOW_ALL_HOSTS_VALIDATOR`.
  **Full car-side nav** via a `screen/` package: `MainCarScreen` (Home/Work/recent/saved,
  `PlaceListNavigationTemplate`) → `SearchCarScreen` (`SearchTemplate`) → `RoutePreviewCarScreen`
  (`RoutePreviewNavigationTemplate`, alternates) → `ActiveNavCarScreen` (`NavigationTemplate`).
  `VelaCarSession` owns its OWN AOSP LocationManager feed into the shared `NavSession` (nav runs with
  the phone UI closed) and handles `action.NAVIGATE` geo intents (assistant "navigate to X").
  **Map rendering = `CarMapRenderer`** (MapLibre's public `MapSnapshotter` → Bitmap → the car surface;
  NOT the old VirtualDisplay+Presentation path). It snaps the puck to the route (map-matching), gates
  the location feed to GPS-only (drops coarse network/fused fixes that jumped the puck), and eases the
  puck/heading between the ~1 Hz fixes so the map glides rather than lurches.
  **Turn card requirements (per the Android for Cars docs):** `ActiveNavCarScreen` calls
  `NavigationManager.navigationStarted()` AND `updateTrip()` - both are needed for the RoutingInfo turn
  card + the cluster/HUD nav data; `ManeuverMapper` maps Vela maneuvers → car `Maneuver`/`Step`/`Trip`.
  Manifest also declares `FEATURE_CLUSTER` (instrument-cluster nav) and `CAR_INFO` (AAOS car speed).
  The PHONE also feeds NavSession when not projecting; the car and phone share the one nav loop.
- **Picture-in-picture nav (2026-07-25):** MainActivity carries `supportsPictureInPicture` +
  autoEnter params kept in lockstep with `vm.state.navigating` (Android 12+; pre-12 enters in
  onUserLeaveHint). `PipMode.active` (ui/PipMode.kt) is flipped by onPictureInPictureModeChanged
  and MapScreen wraps EVERYTHING after the VelaMapView call in one `if (!pipUi)` gate, plus a
  tiny distance-and-turn strip for the small window - any NEW map chrome must live inside that
  gate or it will render wall-to-wall in the mini map. The turn heads-up (NavigationService's
  `vela_nav_turns` channel) deliberately stays quiet while PiP is up: the activity is still
  STARTED in PiP, so AppVisibility.foreground remains true and the alert gate sees "visible".
- **Long downloads NEVER ride viewModelScope (issue #212, 2026-07-23).** Every multi-MB download
  (voice model, ASR engine, region graph, place pack, overlay, update APK, offline place data)
  launches through `MapViewModel.downloadLaunch(label) { ... }`: the work runs on the app-lifetime
  `DownloadWork.scope` (Main.immediate, byte-identical threading to viewModelScope) and a
  refcounted `dataSync` foreground service (`app/download/DownloadService`, quiet notification)
  holds the process alive for its duration - viewModelScope is cancelled the moment the task is
  swiped, and without the FGS an OEM background killer (the issue's Galaxy) reaps the process
  seconds after Home. Labeled returns inside those blocks are `return@downloadLaunch`. Progress
  writes to a cleared ViewModel are inert by design; installed-ness is derived from disk at next
  init. When adding a NEW download, use downloadLaunch, not a bare scope.
  **And every download is CANCELLABLE (2026-07-23):** the store download fns take an
  `active: () -> Boolean` polled per chunk (abort flows into the normal failure cleanup); the VM
  holds per-kind AtomicBoolean cancel flags + cancelXxxDownload() fns, resets each flag at download
  START, and suppresses the "failed" toast when the flag is set (a cancel is not a failure). The
  map-area TILE save is the exception (MapLibre's own machinery): cancel = detach observer +
  STATE_INACTIVE + delete the partial region (`cancelAreaDownload`), and its progress is
  STATE-DRIVEN (`areaDownloadPct` -> the area variant of RegionDownloadCard) - OfflineMaps.download
  takes structured callbacks now, NEVER a status-string spam callback (per-tick flashes stacked a
  second banner with raw coords over the progress card, user 2026-07-23; the stored region name
  keeps the coords - it is what tells saved areas apart in Settings - but no banner shows it).
  A new download UI site must show a Cancel wherever it shows progress (skip it during the
  unpack/install phase - the bytes are already down).
- **Settings is HUB-AND-SPOKE (2026-07-23, ported from alltechdev/vela-dpad; supersedes the
  2026-07-10 single-page order):** `ui/settings/` = `SettingsScreen` (a plain hoisted-state
  dispatcher over the `SettingsSection` enum, no nav library; BACK peels spoke -> hub -> map),
  `SettingsHub` (category rows + the SETTINGS SEARCH, a static `SEARCH_INDEX` of label-resource ->
  section where a match OPENS THE SPOKE - the old measured scroll-to-Y died with the long page;
  add new row labels to the index), `SettingsScaffold` (the one place all the Settings D-pad focus
  plumbing lives - every page builds on it, see docs/dpad.md) and `SettingsComponents`
  (SettingsGroup/ToggleRow/SelectableRow/GroupDivider/PageIntro/Hint), with one file per spoke in
  `ui/settings/sections/`. Spoke contents: Appearance (theme incl. the new AMOLED true-black
  ThemeMode, interface size, map colors, Material You, units, follow-system language toggle),
  Map (layer toggles + 3D + missing-building fill + the Places-on-the-map group), Offline maps
  (moved up between Map and Place pages 2026-07-23 - people reach it often, same reasoning as the
  old single-page order), Place pages,
  Navigation (keep-screen-on, traffic lights, vibrate chips, demo drive, sim location, parking
  history), Voice (spoken-directions master switch, engine list, inline collapsible Voice library
  - the separate VoiceBrowseScreen route is gone, `openVoiceLibrary` deep-links to the VOICE spoke
  with the library expanded), Search (ASR engines + provider picker), Saved places
  (saved + lists export/import), Data & privacy (privacy link, live rechecks), Diagnostics
  (share-diagnostics, texture render, building debug, trip recording, crash card), About
  (support, version tap-to-copy, auto-update, nightly toggle, check now). ⚠️ The vela-dpad fork
  DROPPED many mainline settings in its redesign (Material You, map colors, UI scale, POI sizing,
  parking, lists export, nightly, spoken-directions toggle, live rechecks, building overlay/debug,
  trip tools); they were all restored during the port - when cherry-picking future settings work
  from that fork, diff the feature surface, not just the files. (Old single-page order note:
  OLD: **Settings ORDER is deliberate (declutter reorg 2026-07-10):** Appearance →
  Map style → Units → Language → **Offline maps** → Search → Map (traffic/transit) → **Place pages**
  (ShowReviews / read-all-reviews / LoadPhotos / hide-adult / hide-external-links) → Navigation (keep-screen-on, vibrate-on-turns as
  FilterChips one per mode, parking history) → Voice → Saved places → Lists → Data & privacy →
  Diagnostics (share-diagnostics + the crash card) → **Advanced** → **Developer** → About/Support/
  Version(+updater). Two **collapsible buckets at the bottom** hold the rarely-touched toggles, moved
  out of their old sections: **Advanced** = 3D buildings + traffic-light guidance; **Developer** =
  demo drive, simulate location, trip recording (each "turn off for real use"). The two **content
  filters (hide-adult, hide-external-links) stay in Place pages** with the other place-content
  toggles (user 2026-07-10), NOT Advanced. **Offline maps** (renamed from "Offline") sits right below Language, ABOVE Search (people reach it often, user 2026-07-10). Its two subheads were reframed 2026-07-10 (user: region vs routing region read confusing): **"Local area"** (the viewport download: map + roads + addresses for where you are) and **"States & countries"** (renamed from "Routing regions": the whole-region graph + place pack, framed as "everything to get around a state/province/country offline"). The region filter field just says "Search" (the old "Filter N regions…" wrapped to multiple lines). **Language is a "Follow
  system language" ToggleRow** that reveals the language picker (all supported languages) only when OFF (seeded with
  `AppLocale.deviceDefaultSupported()`); most people never see the list. **The Voice library is a
  DEDICATED screen** (`VoiceBrowseScreen`, reached by the "Browse voices" `OutlinedButton` in the
  Voice section) not an inline accordion - `SettingsScreen` early-returns to it when
  `showVoiceLibrary`; its own Back returns to Settings. Put a new setting in the section it serves;
  niche/experimental → Advanced, demo/test tools → Developer, place-content → Place pages not Map.)
- **Route-row traffic words GRADE with the ETA colour (2026-07-10):** the "live traffic" tag in
  RouteOption's via line is now "light/moderate/heavy traffic", switched on `trafficRatio` at the
  SAME thresholds `trafficEtaColor` uses (>1.4 heavy red, >1.15 moderate amber, else light green) -
  words back up the colour for colour-blind users. Ratio-less live routes keep the plain "live
  traffic"; keep the thresholds in lockstep if either side changes.
- **Guidance volume (2026-08-08, issue #245):** Settings > Voice "Guidance volume" chips
  (Softer 0.6 / Normal 1.0 / Louder 1.6 / Loudest 2.2; pref `voice_volume`). The neural voice
  applies it as a plain gain over its float PCM hard-clipped at full scale (speech rarely peaks
  there, so the boost stays clean); the system-TTS path takes `KEY_PARAM_VOLUME` capped at 1.0 -
  Android can only ATTENUATE system voices, which the hint says. `MapViewModel.setVoiceVolume`
  persists + relays + auditions the nav sample; init relays the saved value.
- **Voice install/fallback never auto-speaks (2026-07-10):** `selectVoice(id, audition)` only
  auditions the nav sample on an EXPLICIT library pick ("Use" button); the download-completion
  (firstEver) and delete-fallback paths pass audition=false - a phone that starts talking on its
  own right after an install reads as a bug (user report). The Test button is the on-demand way.
- **Voice download shows a distinct "Installing…" after 100% (2026-07-19):** a voice download hits
  100% and then spends ~15 s unpacking the ~67 MB archive; the map card already flips to
  `voiceInstalling` ("Installing Vela Voice…"), but the three SETTINGS progress sites (the Voice
  section install line, the Voice-library reinstall line, and each `VoiceRow`) kept printing
  "Downloading … 100%" through the unpack and read as a hang (user report). They now switch to
  `settings_voice_search_installing` ("Installing…") with an indeterminate bar while
  `state.voiceInstalling`. Any new voice-download progress UI must read `voiceInstalling`, not just
  `voiceDownloadPct`.
- **Depart at / Arrive by is confirm-driven (2026-07-11):** a time change re-routes TRANSIT
  ONLY (`setDirectionsTime`) - the keyless drive/walk/bike request has no departure field, so
  refetching it returned identical routes and just flickered the list; the chooser's arrival
  window math is what actually changes. The Depart-at/Arrive-by chips open the time picker
  DIRECTLY and NOTHING emits until a picker confirms (the old flow fetched on the bare chip
  tap with an unpicked "now", then again per dial); the default time rounds to the next 5
  minutes. Pickers are Material 3 TimePicker/DatePicker in `PickerDialog` (a raw-Dialog Vela
  shell, D-pad rule compliant; NB DatePicker's selectedDateMillis is UTC midnight - decode
  with UTC or picks land a day early). The old android.app Holo dialogs are gone. The chooser's single-estimate
  fallback shows the plain time (the "~" prefix read as clutter, user 2026-07-11), and every
  OutlinedButton on the directions family (Steps, the time/date fields, transit Back) is a
  FilledTonalButton stadium pill - outlined was the last dated control there. The
  search-along-route chips are SOLID tonal (they are one-shot actions; a permanently
  unselected FilterChip read as disabled) while the REAL selection groups (travel mode,
  leave/depart/arrive) keep the M3 filled-when-selected contrast on purpose - filling those
  would erase the selection signal. Past picks are impossible: the date picker greys out days
  before today and a confirmed past time clamps to the next 5-minute mark now, WITH a toast
  (`place_time_past_toast`, all locales): the pill shows a different time than the pick,
  and a silent rewrite of explicit input reads as a bug.
- **The directions ENDPOINTS live in a TOP card now (`RouteTopCard`, 2026-07-13):** while the
  chooser is open the search bar swaps for a Google-style card at the top of the screen - origin /
  stops / destination rows down a glyph rail (teal ring = your location, connector dots, red pin =
  destination, matching PoiIcons.RESULT_RED), back arrow left, swap right, an Add stop row when no
  stops exist; rows tap through to the same beginPickOrigin/openStopsEditor actions. The bottom
  DirectionsPanel LOST its header (and the originName/onEdit*/stops/onSwap/onClose params) - it
  keeps mode chips / time chooser / routes / Start, so collapsing it to the Start bar no longer
  hides the endpoints (Google's layout, better on small screens). The card hides while the search
  overlay, steps preview or stops editor own the screen; chrome colours (colorScheme tokens, NOT
  SheetPalette - it replaces the search bar). Device-verified: card, edit rows, swap-reroutes,
  collapse-keeps-card. **Minimizing the chooser re-frames the route closer (2026-07-14):** the
  panel reports its collapsed state up (DirectionsPanel `onCollapsedChange` -> MapScreen
  `dirMinimized`), the camera bottom inset drops 0.58 -> 0.14 of the screen, and the route fit
  in VelaMapView keys on the insets as well as the geometry so the inset change re-runs it -
  with only the Start bar left, the route gets nearly the whole map. Deliberately NOT
  auto-minimized after a beat: the list is what you're choosing from, and surprise motion
  right after opening reads as the UI fighting you; one flick down now has a real payoff.
- **The directions chooser drags like the other sheets (2026-07-11):** its settle flips
  `collapsed` AFTER the glide, never before - flipping first fired `LaunchedEffect(collapsed)`
  into a SECOND animateTo racing the decay (the "bounces off the top" on swipe-up-to-reopen,
  fixed 2026-07-11); it also pan-minimizes via `minimizeTick`/`dirPanTick` (consume-once
  guard) like the place + results sheets. the drag detector sits
  on the WHOLE panel column, not the handle (finger anywhere grows/shrinks it; inner clickables
  keep their taps, the scrolling body keeps its nested-scroll path). Travel mode is STICKY
  (pref `travel_mode`, set in `setTravelMode`, restored by `routeToSelected` - the pick is the
  default next session; parking still forces WALK). The directions X wears the place-sheet
  circle; the swap glyph deliberately stays bare. Save is a BOOKMARK icon, not a star (a star
  reads "rate it"; matches the saved-places map button). Search span: `SearchPb.build` takes
  the caller's real viewport height and stretches the template's baked ~25 km `!1d` window
  (floor 3 km, cap 500 km) - zoomed-out searches used to keep a city-sized net; the VM threads
  its live viewport span into the main + category-chip searches. Results-sheet FILTERS drop
  MAP PINS too: SearchResults reports surviving ids via onShownChange -> MapScreen's
  filteredResultIds -> markersOf (null = filters off).
 its body height is a
  hand-driven Animatable (0 = minimized, ~0.58 screen = open) - handle AND body-at-top drags
  move it 1:1, release rides the throw's decay to an end (the shared grammar). The body and
  the minimized Start bar both fold with that height (SheetFold, inverse fractions), so the
  collapsed flip swaps nothing visible; the old collapse was a 6px-threshold boolean flip.
- **Directions "Leave now" ETA line (2026-07-10):** "Arrive at 5:30 PM" renders titleMedium
  SemiBold in ink - the small dim line with a "current traffic" note under it was clutter (the
  traffic-coloured per-route ETAs already carry that signal); the "Usually X-Y min" typical-range
  note stays. `place_current_traffic` was deleted from all locales.
- **The sheet physics recipe is SHARED (2026-07-11):** the place sheet, the search-results sheet
  and the DirectionsPanel body all use the same grammar - a hand-driven `Animatable` (height for
  the sheets, a 0..1 body FRACTION for the chooser) dragged 1:1 (handle + content-at-top nested
  scroll), settled by `exponentialDecay(1.6)` picking the nearest detent from the natural coast
  endpoint with a bounds-clamped `animateDecay` ride (spring only when the throw doesn't carry),
  and the animated value read in a LAYOUT modifier so frames never recompose content. Port this
  recipe to any new sheet; don't invent a fourth gesture system.
- **Place-sheet drag physics are CONTINUOUS (2026-07-10):** the sheet height is a hand-driven
  `Animatable` - drags (handle or body-at-top) move it 1:1 with the finger, release projects the
  fling and RIDES THE THROW'S OWN INERTIA to the nearest detent: the landing point comes from
  `exponentialDecay(friction 1.6).calculateTargetValue` (friction 1.6 = the same eagerness as the
  earlier linear 0.15 factor, coast = v/(4.2*friction) - it's the one tuning knob), and when the
  natural coast reaches the detent the settle IS `animateDecay` clamped by Animatable bounds at
  the detent - no spring snap, the detent just stops the coast (Google's feel, user 2026-07-10).
  Only throws that don't carry (gentle drops, releases against the velocity) glide on the spring
  (NoBouncy/350f). The animated height is read
  in the LAYOUT modifier on the Card, NEVER in composition - a composition read recomposed the
  entire sheet every animation frame (the tap-to-expand dropped-frames report). The old grammar flipped a whole detent at a pixel
  threshold and hopped there - the "staccato" feel. State flips from taps / the reviews panel /
  auto-expand still animate via a LaunchedEffect that SKIPS when a settle is already targeting
  that detent (restarting would zero the coast velocity). A swipe still never CLOSES the sheet.
- **In-nav search along route (2026-07-13, map-FAB layout 2026-07-14):** a right-edge FAB STACK
  on the nav map (recenter-when-detached + volume + search - the bottom bar was cramming four
  controls, and Google floats these) arms `NavSearchChips` (a free-text field + Gas/Food/Coffee/
  Groceries chips, `NavOverlays.kt`) above the bar; the bar itself is ETA + Steps + End only; a pick runs the normal
  `searchAlongRoute` (which skips stashing `alongRouteDest` while navigating), the nav branch of
  MapScreen's bottom `when` steps aside while `state.results` is non-empty so the results sheet
  shows, and `selectPlace` gates on `navigating` -> `addStopDuringNav` -> `NavSession.addStop`
  (user-ordered replan: the pick becomes the NEXT stop, marks null until the new route lands so
  a failed fetch keeps the stop for the next reroute/recheck; no back-on-course discard, no
  cooldown). BACK order: results list, then the chip row, then end-nav - browsing gas stations
  must never end the drive. **Only a RESULTS pick adds a stop (2026-07-14):** every map tap
  during a drive funnels into selectPlace too (ambient dots, resolved POIs), and a stray tap
  used to silently pin itself onto the route - selectPlace's nav gate now requires the results
  list to be open, and onPoiTap / onMapLongPress / onAddressLabelTap / onTransitStopTap
  early-return while navigating (their invisible selection popped up as a ghost sheet when
  the drive ended).
- **Nav declutter is MODE-AWARE (2026-07-16):** the aggressive strip (basemap shields, bike/trails,
  hillshade, transit lines, vela-addr numbers, gas-stations-only POIs, addr-refresh pause) keys on
  navMode && navDriveMode (DRIVE routes only) - walking/biking keeps all of it (a bike route needs
  the bike accents). The nav label bubbles show ONLY streets that geometrically CROSS the route ahead (a
  quantized pass: querySourceFeatures over transportation_name with a class filter + segment
  intersection against the route window, re-run once per 400 m quantum of progress or when the
  upcoming turn targets change - NEVER on a short timer, the 4 s version was itself a
  frame-hitch: main-thread feature materialization + placement churn per filter change). Since 2026-07-21 the crossing test ALSO counts
  T-JUNCTIONS (touchesWindow: either endpoint of a street within ~25 m of the route window) - on
  arterials most side streets END at your road instead of crossing it, the strict-inequality
  crossing test read their shared endpoint as exactly zero, and the tightened filter came back
  EMPTY = the whole bubble layer went mute on T-heavy roads (real-drive report; grid downtowns
  were where the layer was originally verified). Endpoints only, never every vertex - a parallel
  road must not label itself. And the MINOR tier now arms at z15 (fade 15.2-15.7, was 16/16.2-16.8)
  so cross-street bubbles survive highway-speed zoom (~15.8 floor) instead of fading out above
  town speed (user ask, same day). Roads
  already DRIVEN are excluded per step (navLabelExclude - excluding the whole route hid the turn
  target's label), the next turns' targets are force-included (a turn target meets the route at
  a shared vertex, which a proper-crossing test can miss); ensureNavRoadLabels self-gates on (on, dark, exclude) with lastNavLabelKey nulled
  on style reload. The current-road shield chip lives on the TOP banner card (currentRef =
  maneuvers[liveStep-1].ref; the exit fold adopts the folded branch's road/ref so it survives
  on-ramps). Rerouting plays a two-note earcon (VoiceGuide.reroutingChime, in-process synth,
  muted-gated) before the throttled spoken word.
  **Nav UI style (2026-07-08):** ManeuverBanner + NavControls are RoundedCornerShape(24/28dp)
  Cards with elevation 6dp, 54dp turn glyph, headlineMedium-bold distance, titleMedium-medium road
  name, FilledTonalIconButton for mute/steps. Keep new nav chrome on this treatment (no flat
  default-radius cards, no OutlinedIconButton circles - that was the "dated" look).
- **Place-sheet surface language (2026-07-10):** header icon buttons (Save/Share/more/close) are
  40dp icons in `dim.copy(alpha = 0.12f)` CIRCLES with 5dp gaps (Google's treatment); ActionPill
  and the "All reviews" button are CircleShape stadium pills (the outlined button was the last
  outlined control on the sheet); the reviews summary block is LEFT-ALIGNED (displaySmall number
  + stars/count stacked beside it), not centered; the MINIMIZED card is NOT a separate surface
  (2026-07-10 refactor, height-locked 2026-07-11): the body is a SKELETON (name row, rating, the
  full action-pill row) plus `SheetFold` sections (photos / status+hours / address+tabs; the
  shared primitive in `ui/SheetFold.kt`, also used by the results sheet's chips) whose
  height+alpha are a FRACTION of natural = the sheet height's own position between the
  minimized floor and peek, read per frame in the layout/graphicsLayer phase. While the fold is
  engaged (fraction < 1) the CARD FLOORS AT THE MINIMIZED DETENT (as a measurement minHeight,
  never just the reported layout size - report-only flooring left the card surface short and a
  strip of map showed under the minimized card, user 2026-07-11): the folding content dips just
  under minH near the floor (the skeleton is a touch shorter than the detent) and the wrap-cap
  card used to dive that last slack in a blink - the end-of-fold hop (user 2026-07-11); at rest
  with fraction = 1 the card still hugs short content (dropped pins, parked car). Landing
  minimized also rescrolls a scrolled body to its top. The fold is
  therefore byte-locked to whatever moves the height (pan glide, a slow drag folds them WITH the
  finger, the release settle) - a separately-clocked exit animation (the first cut used tweens)
  could not stay in step with the height spring and read as staccato. Extras stay composed while
  any part shows and unmount at the settled floor (`derivedStateOf` gate, one recomposition at
  the flip), keeping zero-height controls out of D-pad focus search; the old swap-to-a-mini-card
  popped. A tap anywhere on the minimized body restores peek (a `clickable(enabled = minimized)`
  on the body Column); parking (singleDetent) keeps its extras. Keep new sheet content inside
  one of the extras sections unless it genuinely belongs in the minimized card. **The
  full-screen reviews page closes by pull alone (2026-07-11):** the top-edge pull follows the
  finger; in fullScreen a STARTED pull owns every move until finger-up (the ownership clause
  sits OUTSIDE ReviewsPanel's verticality test - a sideways wobble used to trip the
  boundary-exit end and close mid-drag), and release closes on DISTANCE ONLY (> 120dp) with a
  spring-back below it - the photo viewer's judge-at-release grammar; the old vel > 2500 px/s
  flick escape read as a hair trigger. Keep new sheet controls on this language. NB `RatingHistogram` in
  PlaceSheet is ORPHANED (its per-star counts only exist in the live panel DOM) - wire it or
  delete it, don't duplicate it. **The MENU TAB (2026-07-10)** appears beside Reviews/About when
  `photoCategories` carries a menu-named category (`MENU_TAB_WORDS`, lowercase contains-match on
  Google's LOCALIZED gallery-tab name, which is reused as the tab title); content = the tagged
  photos as a chunked 2-up grid (`MenuTab`) into the shared PhotoGallery; each tile stamps the
  photo's UPLOAD DATE in a corner scrim so a menu's age reads at a glance (user 2026-07-11).
  **Gallery dates are a JOIN of two keyless sources (2026-07-11):** the WebView page walk has
  the CATEGORY tags but no dates, the hspqX RPC has each photo's date but no categories - so
  `fetchPhotos` fires the cheap RPC alongside the walk and joins dates by the stable image id
  (URL up to the size suffix). There is NO uploader/author keyless (the RPC documents it;
  mining the page DOM for it was judged not worth the walking - user leaned that way too).
  **The inline Reviews tab renders a NATIVE RATING HISTOGRAM (2026-07-11):**
  `Place.ratingHistogram` ([5-star..1-star] counts) is scraped IN PASSING by the photo walk
  from the place page's aria-label star rows (the same rows the full-screen panel carves),
  bridged via `WebPhotoFetcher.fetch(onHistogram=...)`, cached per feature id beside the photo
  LRU, and drawn by `RatingHistogram` beside the big rating number; absent = no bars, no cost. **Menu photo DATES are BLOCKED - and it is NOT a calibration drift (proven 2026-07-11, desktop capture):** the hspqX
  placePhotos RPC returns 0 photos now (logcat tag `VelaPhotoDates`: rpc=0). The "recapture
  photosProto from a desktop gallery RPC" route the earlier note left open is now CLOSED. A live
  desktop `maps.google.com` capture of the on-load `hspqX` (`/MapsPhotoService.ListEntityPhotos`
  via `batchexecute?rpcids=hspqX`) shows the endpoint AND the field-index matrix
  (`[[[1,0,3],[2,1,2],[2,0,3],[8,0,3],[10,0,3],[10,1,2],[10,0,4],[9,1,2]],1]`) are BYTE-IDENTICAL
  to `calibration.json`'s `photosProto` - nothing drifted, so a version bump would be a no-op.
  The real blocker is **bot-gating on the photos RPC**: replaying the request three ways from an
  automated browser - Vela's ftid-in-`[2][0]` form, the captured per-page photo-token form
  (`0qlSas...`, `["<tok>",...,81,...,16698]`), AND the genuine page's OWN fresh-token on-load
  request - all returned `[null,0,null,"<ei>"]` = zero photos (0 `googleusercontent` in the body).
  Same TLS/behavioural degradation that gives OkHttp the Street-View-only reply; the live gallery
  the app DOES show comes from the WebView DOM WALK, which has categories but no per-photo dates.
  So dates need the RPC to answer inside a trusted (non-automated, non-keyless) session, which the
  keyless model can't mint. The date-join plumbing stays correct + inert (stamps render only when a
  date exists). **Don't recalibrate photosProto (it already matches) and don't re-run a desktop
  capture (proven bot-gated to empty). Don't chase it in-app.**
  **Menu-tab reliability hardening (2026-07-11):** the walk's tab wait
  counts from the GALLERY OPENING (6 ticks after open, hard cap 20) instead of 8 ticks from
  script start - cold-WebView loads ate the old window and real tabs got skipped; a late-tab
  rescue in the All sweep walks tabs that appear after phase 0 gave up; every walk reports
  {tabs, opened, openedAt, rescued, ticks} via `VelaBridge.onInfo` (logcat tag
  `VelaPhotoWalk`); and a TAB-LESS cached gallery self-heals with ONE fresh walk per session
  (`retriedTabless`) instead of being served forever - one flaky fetch used to hide a menu all
  session. Walk cap 70 ticks, Kotlin timeout 48 s. There is NO keyless
  menu URL (probed 2026-07-10: search payload [38] empty, zero menu links) - don't chase the
  link; the quality follow-up is making WebPhotoFetcher scrape the menu TAB exhaustively. The
  inline review search hides behind a circled magnifier beside the All-reviews pill
  (`reviewSearchOpen`; toggling closed clears the query so a hidden filter can't keep filtering).
- **Chip style = stadium pills (2026-07-08):** EVERY chip (map CategoryChips, results-panel filter
  chips Open-now/top-rated/price/sort + the collapsed "N results" pill, PlaceSheet travel-mode chips
  now with a leading `Icons.Default.Directions*` glyph, Settings vibrate-on-turns FilterChips) sets
  `shape = androidx.compose.foundation.shape.CircleShape` - full-radius pills, Google-style. The M3
  default 8dp-corner chip read "dated" (user 2026-07-08). Keep any new chip on CircleShape; monochrome
  leading icons (tint `onSurface`, not the teal primary) so it reads single-ink like Google's.
- **Search-results sheet - BOTTOM sheet with drag detents (`MapScreen.SearchResults`, 2026-07-08).**
  After one day as a top sheet the user flipped it: results now rise from the BOTTOM, Google-style
  (the top-of-menu grab pill read clunky). It renders with the other bottom surfaces in MapScreen's
  bottom `when` (nav / directions / place sheet win the slot first) and shares the place sheet's
  detent grammar: **MINIMIZED** (a short "N results" bar; = the VM's `resultsCollapsed`, so the back
  gesture and the sheet agree) ↔ **PEEK** (~0.42 list cap) ↔ **EXPANDED** (~0.82, fills the screen).
  Handle TAP steps up; drag UP grows a detent, DOWN shrinks one; the nested-scroll connection steps
  ONE detent per gesture (re-armed in `onPreFling`) with an up-drag into the list expanding - a hard
  fling can cross two detents, which matches Google. **BACK also steps one detent** - `resultsExpanded`
  is HOISTED to MapScreen so the BackHandler does expanded → peek → minimized → CLEARED (a back on the
  minimized bar used to exit the app; now it runs `clearSearch()` to the bare map); and the sheet
  modifier carries `statusBarsPadding()` so the expanded handle pill stops below the clock / camera
  cutout instead of sliding under it (all user 2026-07-09). **Camera frames the result CLUSTER:** the
  marker-fit branch in VelaMapView median-centers the pins and drops outliers past 4x the median
  spread (min 40 km) so one stray far hit can't zoom the map to a continental view; it fits with the
  results-sheet bottom inset (0.50 screen) so pins sit above the sheet; `lastFittedMarkersKey` re-arms
  while the sheet is minimized so expanding re-frames; and the fit CONSUMES `lastCameraTarget` - the
  inset-grow nulls it, and with it null the else-recenter branch re-fired on the STALE VM center one
  recomposition later and yanked the camera back to wherever you were before the search (device-found
  2026-07-09, the "search framed then snapped home" bug). There is **NO "hide results" button**. **Grabbing the map minimizes the sheets (2026-07-10):**
  `VelaMapView.onUserPan` (fired from the camera-move-started listener on REASON_API_GESTURE,
  the same signal "Search this area" keys off) → MapScreen collapses the results sheet to its
  bar while `resultsShown` AND bumps `sheetPanTick` → PlaceSheet's `minimizeTick` effect glides
  an open place card to its minimized detent - Google's behaviour; programmatic framing (a
  different move reason) never triggers it. Both drops use a SOFT spring (stiffness 140f, vs
  the 350f settle). Flip order differs BY DESIGN: the RESULTS sheet still GLIDES FIRST and flips
  `resultsCollapsed` after; its FILTER CHIPS + divider fold with the list height over its last
  140dp of travel (`SheetFold`, and the bar's bottom padding is constant), so by the flip they
  are zero-height and nothing visible pops - they used to pop out after the sheet had already
  stopped moving (user 2026-07-11). The PLACE sheet flips `minimizedState` FIRST so its
  SheetFold extras run concurrently with the height glide (no swap anymore, see the place-sheet
  surface-language bullet) - the same order its drag-release path uses. The minimized results bar leads with the QUERY (or list name) in ink +
  SemiBold with the dim count on its OWN LINE under it (the inline "title · count" floated
  awkwardly against the right-side buttons) - the bare dim count was easy to miss. BOTH pan-tick
  effects carry a **seenTick consume-once guard** (initialized to the tick's mount-time value):
  a LaunchedEffect fires on FIRST composition too, so a remounted sheet (pick a place from the
  list, or return from one) used to replay the stale tick and open pre-minimized (user
  2026-07-10). Any new tick-style signal into a sheet needs the same guard. **Filter
  chips are `ElevatedFilterChip` with an explicit filled `chipColors`** (subtle alpha tint off, solid
  `primary` teal + check on, `border = null`). **Rating/Price/Sort are VelaMenu chips (2026-07-10)**
  (tiers 3.5+/4.0+/4.5+, price levels, Relevance/Rating/Distance) - blind cycling hid the options;
  plus a "Wheelchair accessible" toggle chip filtering `Place.wheelchairAccessible`, parsed in
  SearchParser off the LANGUAGE-NEUTRAL attribute id `has_wheelchair_accessible_entrance` in the
  `[1][100][1]` attribute block (labels arrive localized, ids don't; unit-tested). That block is
  the ONE attribute family the keyless search ships per result - vegetarian/reservations/etc.
  exist only in per-place About data, so result-list filtering on them is not feasible keyless
  (don't re-chase). Filters stay LOCAL to the fetched results by design; no cuisine facets (the
  query is the cuisine filter). **Chrome:** `resultsShown` (peek/expanded) hides the
  scale bar / locate FAB / "Search this area"; `resultsMinimized` shows them again but LIFTED by
  `chromeLift` (76dp) so nothing sits on the minimized bar. The compass is MapLibre's built-in
  (`setCompassMargins`), which fades facing north (Google's behaviour) and reappears when
  rotated/tilted or during heading-up nav - never removed, just north-hidden on the browse map.
  Its browse-mode top margin is statusBar + 122dp so it sits BELOW the floating search bar and the
  category chips (8dp under the status bar put it exactly behind the bar - a half-hidden circle, 2026-07-09).
  **With the LAYERS button enabled the browse margin is statusBar + 200dp instead (2026-07-15):** the
  layers circle owns statusBar+128dp in the same corner and its IconButton touch overflow reaches
  ~190dp, which sat exactly on the compass (user report); 200dp clears the touch target, not just
  the visible circle. Keyed on `LayersButton.on` (the pref), not the button's transient visibility,
  so the compass doesn't jump around as sheets open.
  **Landscape panel width is HALF THE SCREEN, floored 400dp / capped 520dp (`sidePanelWidth()`,
  2026-07-23)** - the fixed 400 read too narrow; every consumer (both sheets' widthIn, the camera
  left inset, the attribution pad) reads the computed value. **Sheet heights RE-SNAP on rotation:**
  the place-sheet and results-sheet settle effects key on screenH/landscape too - without that the
  Animatable kept the old orientation's pixel height and an expanded portrait card came into
  landscape over the search bar. **Chrome hides are MEASURED, not logical (2026-07-23):** a
  short-content place flips expandedState while its wrap-capped card never grows, so the search-bar
  hide requires placeSheetTopPx < 0.40*screen and the layers button relies on the measured
  clearOfPlaceSheet gate alone - never re-add a bare placeSheetExpanded gate on map chrome.
  **LANDSCAPE (width > height) collapses the browse chrome to ONE line (2026-07-15, Google's
  landscape layout, device-verified on the 4a):** `landscapeChrome` in MapScreen puts the search
  bar at half width with the category chips scrolling beside it (`landscapeOneLine` Row), the
  layers button rises to statusBar+74dp and the compass margins drop to 140dp (layers on) / 95dp -
  on a phone's ~390dp landscape height the stacked offsets pushed the compass down into the
  parking/locate FABs. TRAP: the one-line condition must NOT include `!searchOpen` - focusing the
  bar flips searchOpen, and moving the SearchBar to a different subtree REMOUNTS it, which blurs
  the field, which flips searchOpen back: the search page could never open (first build had it;
  caught on-device). Instead the Row always renders in the landscape bare-map state and only
  MODIFIERS change with searchOpen (bar Box weight(1f) -> fillMaxWidth, chips drop out after it),
  so the field node never moves. The keypad-phone D-pad devices are portrait, so AdaptiveDensity
  targets never see this layout.
- **Search-result markers are Google's result treatment (2026-07-10, `PoiIcons` result section +
  the `vela-markers`/`vela-markers-dots` layers in `VelaMapView`).** Every result keeps the app's own
  marker language - grey teardrop, circle, white glyph - with the circle RED (`resultPin`,
  drawn a step smaller than the ambient icons' backing); rated FOOD results get the wide rating
  "speech bubble": the same red circle + white glyph beside the rating in plain ink, NO star
  glyph (`ratingBubble`, label passed as a string so non-rating labels can ride the same bubble;
  theme-surfaced, regenerated per style load because bitmaps can't theme).
  Bitmaps are generated ON DEMAND in applyData's marker loop (`ensureResultIcon` - bubble keys
  carry the rating tenths, so only the ratings actually on screen get bitmaps). The pin layer
  COLLIDES by rank (`symbolSortKey` = result order, allowOverlap false): in a dense downtown the
  best results keep pins and the rest draw as the small red dots of `vela-markers-dots` (same
  source, below, allowOverlap+ignorePlacement true), expanding back into pins on zoom - never a
  pile of overlapping icons. Pins anchor BOTTOM (tip = the place), labels try UNDER the pin,
  then its right, then its left (variableAnchor TOP/LEFT/RIGHT, radialOffset 0.7 - below-only
  dropped labels in crowded views, user 2026-07-10) in NEUTRAL ink both themes. The AMBIENT and
  OSM poi layers got the same treatment (2026-07-10): four anchor slots (RIGHT/LEFT/TOP/BOTTOM,
  = left of icon / right of it / below / above) instead of the old two - icons still collide by
  design, but a rendered icon's label now finds a clear side instead of dropping or sitting on a
  neighbour's dot - Google doesn't category-tint result labels,
  only ambient POI labels take the tint. resultPin's GEOMETRY is marker()'s exact proportions at
  0.86 scale (a taller-tailed variant read as a different species of pin, user 2026-07-10) -
  keep the two in lockstep. **OSM POIs hide by COVERAGE, not ambient non-emptiness (2026-07-10):**
  `MapUiState.ambientCoversView` (computed each onViewport settle: ambient non-empty AND centre
  within 0.35x of `lastAmbientSpan` of the fetch centre AND viewRadius ≤ 0.55x span; forced true
  when a fresh fetch lands, false under z14) drives the poi_r* visibility - blanket-hiding left
  the outskirts iconless because one fetch only covers ~3.5-9 km (user 2026-07-10). Controls
  (signs/lights) render from z17.5 on the browse map but z15.4 during nav (set in the nav
  declutter effect; 15.4 sits just under the nav camera's 15.5 zoom floor so they can't blink
  out at highway speed - half of issue #248). While a result SET is on the map (markers.size > 1) the basemap
  poi_r1/r7/r20 icons hide too, AND the traffic-control layers (stop signs + lights,
  `lastControlsVis` - controls stay up beside the ambient dots on the browse map, so their
  predicate is the result set alone). Own identity gates, NOT inside the ambient gate -
  results can appear/clear while ambient stays empty; a single selected place keeps both. Dots
  carry the same MARKER_INDEX_PROP feature prop, so a collapsed result is still tappable.
  **Gas stations put their LIVE PRICE in the bubble** (2026-07-10): `Place.fuelPrice`
  ("$5.34/Regular") parses off the place node at `[88][0]` (calibration `paths.fuelPrice`,
  remote-recalibratable, digit-gated in SearchParser so a shape drift can't show a label as a
  price; calibration.json is at **v14** for it), the bubble shows the short "$5.34"
  (`PoiIcons.fuelShort`), and the full string renders BOLD - its own pump-glyph line under the
  address in the result row (glyph + text in title ink, theme-responsive) and bold inline on the
  place sheet's price/category line (user 2026-07-10). EV chargers carry NO detail in the
  keyless response (probed 2026-07-10 - type marker only, no price/kW/availability); see ROADMAP.
- **Typed coordinates drop a pin (2026-07-13):** pasting "37.77, -122.42" (or a geo: string) into
  the search box goes through `MapLinkParser.parseBareCoordinate` (strict whole-string match, both
  halves need a decimal point, range-checked, unit-tested) -> the same reverse-geocoded pin a
  long-press drops, instead of hitting the search endpoint as text. Addresses with numbers still
  search normally. External geo:/Maps links were already handled (`openDeepLink`).
- **Map tap resolution order (`VelaMapView` click listener, 2026-07-08; nearest-to-finger 2026-07-14).**
  Every candidate class picks the feature NEAREST the tap in SCREEN pixels (`screenDist2`) - every
  pick used to be `firstOrNull` on `queryRenderedFeatures`, which returns RENDER-STACK order, so
  the generous 48dp hit box at street zoom handed the tap to whichever neighbour the renderer
  listed first (the dense-strip-mall wrong-POI reports). A single tap resolves, in priority:
  (1) our search-result pin → `onMarkerTap`; (2) a canonical GTFS stop icon; (3) a greyed
  alternate route line → `onSelectAlternate`; (4) a BUSINESS - the ambient Google POI dots/icons
  and the NAMED basemap POIs compete BY DISTANCE, not by class (absolute ambient priority let a
  few-px ambient dot anywhere in the box steal a tap landed dead on a basemap icon): nearest of
  the two → `onAmbientTap` / `onPoiTap`; (5) a **HOUSE-NUMBER label** (basemap `vela-housenumber` `housenumber`
  or the address overlay `vela-addr-*` `number`, queried by layer id) → `onAddressLabelTap(number,
  labelPoint)`; (6) an unnamed POI icon (has `class`, no name) → reverse-geocode at the tap; (7) a
  **BUILDING footprint** (`building`/`building-3d` basemap fill or the `vela-ovl-*` overlay fill,
  queried by layer id) → reverse-geocode at the tap; else nothing (only a long-press drops a raw
  coordinate pin on empty land, as before). NB the long-press-while-planning "route through here"
  add-stop no longer flashes a heads-up banner (2026-07-13): the route refetch reset `status` a beat
  later so it blinked unreadably, and the stop appearing in the chooser + the route redrawing IS the
  feedback (`mapvm_stop_added` string removed from all locales). **And it only fires while the chooser
  is MINIMIZED to its Start bar with the steps viewer closed (2026-07-15, device-verified):**
  building/unnamed-POI TAPS funnel into the same handler, so with the full picker (or the step list)
  covering the map a stray tap on the visible strip silently added a stop and rerouted; suppressed
  presses do nothing at all (a dropped pin would be an invisible sheet under the open chooser). The
  chooser's collapsed state reaches the VM via `MapViewModel.onDirectionsCollapsed` (mirrored from
  MapScreen's dirMinimized); a house-number-label tap while planning delegates to the same gate. The
  deliberate flows (Add stop -> choose on map, the origin picker) are ungated. The STEPS SHEET also
  dismisses by a swipe down anywhere on the body once its list is at the top - a nested-scroll
  connection feeding the card's existing drag offset (the place-sheet dismissConn grammar); mid-list
  swipes still scroll. **The named-POI resolve is
  NAME-AGREEING first (2026-07-14):** onPoiTap searches the tapped name, but the pick used to
  ignore it - bare `nearest` plus the 35 m most-reviewed override let a strip mall's popular
  NEIGHBOUR steal the tap (Google's per-listing pins in a shared building are loose; a sushi
  tap opened the dessert shop two doors down). The pick pool is now the listings whose name
  shares the tapped label's words (`nameAgrees`, word-set overlap needing the shorter name's
  tokens, cap 2); only an EMPTY pool (renamed/closed business) falls back to all results. The
  clear-dominance duplicate override still runs WITHIN the pool (a co-brand's two profiles both
  agree with the tapped label, and the rich one should win). **The house-number case must SNAP to the tapped number:**
  `MapViewModel.onAddressLabelTap` LEADS the pin with the label's own number and uses the reverse-
  geocode only for the street/city, replacing whatever house number the geocode led with (a regex
  strips `^\s*\d+\S*\s+` then prepends the tapped number). Reason: Google's reverse-geocode snaps to
  the nearest ADDRESSABLE point, which for a tapped OSM label routinely returns a NEIGHBOUR (device:
  tapped 1020, raw reverse-geocode said 1040) - exactly the "doesn't snap to the house number"
  complaint. A real business sitting on the point still wins (if the geocode has a rating/category it's
  shown as-is). Device-verified: tapping a numbered house label opens exactly that number, not the
  neighbour the raw geocode returned; a bare footprint resolves to the building's own address.
- **Place-content toggles (2026-07-08):** `ShowReviews` / `LoadPhotos` reactive holders
  (`ui/PlaceContent.kt`, same shape as `LiveReviews`, init in VelaApp, rows in Settings → Map).
  They gate BOTH fetch (`fetchReviews`/`fetchPhotos` first line) and render (PlaceSheet `hasReviews`
  + the photo-hero `if`), so off = zero scrape traffic. Keep any new review/photo surface behind them.
- **"Hide adult categories" toggle (2026-07-08):** `HideAdult` holder (`ui/PlaceContent.kt`, default
  **off**, init in VelaApp, row in Settings → Map). It flips `CategoryFilter.enabled` (a `:core` flag) - 
  `:core`'s `data/CategoryFilter` filters adult/nightlife/alcohol/gambling/smoking places at the
  `GoogleMapsDataSource.search`/`nearbyPlaces` seam. Match is CATEGORY-only (never name) and PRECISE
  (`EXACT`/`PHRASE`, food "…bar" kept); the keyword lists are **multilingual** (categories arrive
  localized via `hl=<lang>`, so the filter must too). Unit-tested (`CategoryFilterTest`). NB the `:core`
  flag pattern (not reading the app holder from `:core`) is deliberate - mirror it for any future
  content gate that must act inside `:core`.
- **"Hide website & external links" toggle (2026-07-08):** `HideExternalLinks` holder
  (`ui/PlaceContent.kt`, default **off**, init in VelaApp, row in Settings → Map). Gates the Website
  pill/row, the Street View pano and the Book/Reserve/Order action in `PlaceSheet`. Taken from PR #14
  WITHOUT the restricted build flavor (user's call, 2026-07-08) - the flavor/LockableToggle machinery
  was deliberately dropped, keep holders in the plain `ShowReviews` shape. Gate any new external-link
  surface on a place page behind this holder.
- **Full-screen viewers = VISIBLE bars + gradient, NOT hidden bars (2026-07-10).** After many
  rounds fighting a Compose Dialog window to COVER the system bars (window dumps proved it
  re-asserts inset-fitted params and refuses), the working recipe is Google's own: NO_LIMITS +
  TRANSPARENT status/nav bar colors + `Modifier.requiredFullScreen()` on the content root (sizes
  to the true display so it fills UNDER the transparent bars) + a top gradient scrim so the
  status bar reads over the photo. Applies to `PhotoGalleryContent`-era gallery + `FullScreenReviews`.
  Don't reach for hide-bars/dim/decor tricks again - they leave strips. The reviews page uses an
  X (left, matching the gallery) and a top-edge pull-down (panel `onOverscroll`/`onOverscrollEnd`
  → `offset` the Surface → dismiss past 120dp).
- **In-app updater (`app/update/SelfUpdater.kt`, 2026-07-08).** GitHub releases/latest → tag
  `v0.<minor>.<run>` → versionCode `2000+run` compared to BuildConfig; newer → `MapUiState.updateInfo`
  card on the bare map. Download = no-call-timeout client (~80 MB APK) + zip-magic check →
  `filesDir/updates/` (FileProvider `updates` path) → ACTION_VIEW package-archive; the OS verifies
  same package + signature. Launch check ~daily behind `self_update_check` (Settings → Version,
  default on); manual Check-for-updates button there too. "Not now" stores `update_dismissed_code`
  (only a NEWER release re-offers). The tag parse is **minor-agnostic** (`^v0\.\d+\.(\d+)$` - it
  survived the 0.2→0.3 bump untouched), taking only the run number for the versionCode; it still
  assumes the `2000+run` base, so update `SelfUpdater.check` if the versionCode base ever changes.
- **POI-speed trio (2026-07-11):** (1) `nearbyPlaces` STREAMS its category fan-out via an
  `onPartial` callback (paints throttled to >=10 new places + 500 ms apart; the final
  return is still the complete ranked pool) so first dots stop waiting on the SLOWEST of
  ~13 requests; (2) `prefetchAmbientNeighbours` warms the 4 view-sized neighbour areas
  into the ambient LRU after each idle fetch - UNMETERED network only (4 extra fan-outs),
  sequential with 700 ms gaps, skips cached areas, bails on any non-bare-map state; (3)
  the ambient LRU PERSISTS to `ambient_cache.json` (newest 8 areas x 200 slim places via
  :core `AmbientDiskCache` - the app module stays OUT of kotlinx.serialization, the same
  boundary TransitParser keeps; 24 h validity, loaded stamps read as fresh because the
  moved-gate refetches the first real view anyway = paint-then-refine, never
  paint-and-trust). Device-measured on the 4a: cold-launch home-area dots at ~3.0 s
  (bounded by app+map startup, proven the disk path - no network paint can land by then)
  vs ~4.0 s fetch-bound before; the streaming win grows on slow links.
  **Cache-hit fixes (2026-07-11, the P9 "POIs don't stick around / tap-back wipes the map"
  report):** (a) entries carry their fetch SPAN (`AmbientEntry`; disk `AmbientCachedArea.spanM`,
  defaulted so old files decode) and `cachedAmbientNear` hits within `span*0.45` - the old FIXED
  900 m radius missed most legitimate revisits (a z14 fetch covers ~9 km) and forced a full
  refetch; (b) the pre-fetch cache REPAINT is UNCONDITIONAL - the old `ambientPois.isEmpty()`
  gate meant panning BACK to a cached area kept the previous area's dots (non-empty, filtered
  to nothing in view) and never consulted the cache = bare map for the whole refetch; (c) a
  PARTIAL paint never SHRINKS the painted set (after a cache repaint the early pool is leaner
  than the cached set and replacing blinked dots off/on; the final ranked pool still replaces
  outright). Don't re-tighten any of the three.
  **Tap-a-POI-and-exit stability (2026-07-15, device-verified before/after):** TWO more rules. (d)
  The ambient layer STAYS UP while a single place sheet is open - `ambientShownOf` in MapScreen
  (used by BOTH the marker upload and onAmbientTap so the AMBIENT_INDEX_PROP indices align) only
  drops the selected place's own copy (name-equal within 150 m, so its icon/label don't double-draw
  under the red pin); the old `selected == null` gate emptied the whole source on every tap and
  re-placed the entire layer on close ("POIs reload when I tap one then exit"). Still hidden while
  results / a route preview / nav / replay own the map. (e) A fetch under `AMBIENT_FRESH_MS` (3 min)
  old that still COVERS the view (the ambientCoversView predicate) is served AS-IS - no network
  refetch: the tap-frame camera shift trips the 180 m moved-gate, and Google's ranking JITTERS
  between identical same-area requests, so the post-close refetch randomly swapped/dropped icons
  (proven on-device: Chipotle vanished, two places flipped to generic pins, ~2 s after closing a
  sheet). Disk-loaded entries are backdated past the window on purpose - they stay paint-then-refine.
- **Zoomed-in pan perf (2026-07-08):** (1) `reportScale` (fires per camera-move FRAME) only pushes
  to compose when mpp moved >1% - an unconditional write recomposed the scale bar every pan frame;
  keep the gate. (2) Both house-number layers (`vela-housenumber` basemap + `vela-addr-N` overlay)
  carry `textIgnorePlacement(true)`: they still YIELD to icons (allow-overlap stays false) but never
  enter the collision index - cheaper placement at street zoom and numbers can't evict icons
  whatever the layer order. (3) `ui/Buildings3d` holder + Settings → Map "3D buildings" toggle sets
  visibility on the basemap `building-3d` fill-extrusion layer (a LaunchedEffect in VelaMapView owns
  visibility; applyLight/applyDark only colour it) - extrusion is the fragment-heavy layer, the
  documented 5a-class stutter source at z16+.
- **Light/dark is `AppTheme` (`ui/theme/AppTheme.kt`), not the OS.** Read the
  in-app theme with the composable **`isAppInDarkTheme()`** - never call
  `isSystemInDarkTheme()` directly in app UI (it ignores the user's Light/Dark/
  System choice in Settings → Appearance). `AppTheme.mode` is a process-wide
  reactive `mutableStateOf` (same shape as `ui/Units`), persisted to
  `vela_settings`, `init()`-ed in `VelaApp`; flipping it recomposes the theme and
  reloads the map style (`VelaMapView`'s styleKey carries `dark=`).
- **List membership matches on featureId, not the volatile place id (2026-07-09).** A Place's `id`
  is `"g:" + name hash + coarse lat` - for a multi-listing chain (Safeway + its pharmacy/bakery
  listings) the tap-resolve can pick a different co-located listing next visit, so the id changes
  and anything keyed on it silently misses (the "note kept not saving" bug). `ListPlace.matches`
  (id OR stable Google featureId) is the ONE membership predicate - PlaceListStore add/remove/
  setNote/listsContaining, the sheet's containingLists and MapViewModel's withListNote all use it.
  Never compare bare `it.id == place.id` for list/saved semantics on Google-backed places.
- **LocationListener must be an explicit object, never the SAM lambda (2026-07-09).** The lambda
  implements ONLY onLocationChanged; onProviderEnabled/onProviderDisabled/onStatusChanged got
  default bodies in the Android 11 SDK, so it compiles clean - but on Android 10 and below the
  framework interface has no defaults and the OS calls onProviderDisabled the moment a registered
  provider is off (degoogled devices often carry a present-but-disabled NETWORK provider) ->
  AbstractMethodError, crash on every launch (user report, Android 10/Adreno 308). Override all
  four callbacks explicitly in any android.location.LocationListener implementation.
- **SavedPlace carries an optional address (2026-07-10).** `SavedPlace.address` (defaulted null, so
  pre-existing payloads decode; every store's Json sets ignoreUnknownKeys so downgrades survive too)
  is filled by `SavedPlace.of(Place)` - recents rows show it as a sublabel and the Home/Work rows
  show it as their subtext. Recents also support PER-ROW removal (`RecentSearchStore.remove(query)`
  / `RecentPlaceStore.remove(placeId)` -> the X in `SuggestionRow(onRemove=...)`, its own D-pad
  focus stop with a ring).
- **Recents stores are timestamped under NEW pref keys (2026-07-09).** `RecentQuery`/`RecentPlace`
  carry `at` (epoch ms) so the search page can interleave queries and places chronologically.
  They persist under `queries2`/`places2`; the legacy `queries`/`places` payloads are READ ONCE
  for migration (synthesized descending stamps) and then LEFT IN PLACE - a downgraded build
  reads its old keys untouched instead of hitting a format it can't decode and wiping the data.
  Follow the same new-key pattern for any future store format change.
- **Material You participation is a hard SPLIT - know which side a surface is on (2026-07-09,
  issue #15).** `DynamicColor` (Settings -> Appearance, off by default, Android 12+) makes
  `VelaTheme` use the wallpaper scheme, so EVERYTHING drawn from `MaterialTheme.colorScheme`
  tints for free: the search bar (surfaceContainerLow), VelaMenu popups (surfaceContainerHigh),
  chips, FABs, dialogs, Settings, the dpadHighlight ring, and the nav notification accent
  (NavigationService reads system_accent1_600 when the pref is on). PINNED NEUTRAL on purpose:
  the place/results sheets (SheetPalette's fixed greys - they're reading surfaces dense with
  meaning-bearing colour: open/closed green/red, star gold, note quotes, photos - and several
  solids were hand-composited against those exact greys, e.g. the opaque filter-chip containers)
  and every map-drawn colour (tiles, route blue, puck). Rules when adding UI: new chrome or
  transient surfaces take colorScheme tokens (they'll theme themselves); content inside a sheet
  takes SheetPalette; don't mix the two on one surface or one of the theme x dynamic combos
  will look wrong. AND pick token pairs whose contrast the scheme GUARANTEES: on a coloured
  container, buttons must use that container's own on-colour, never a default from a different
  role - the faster-route card's default-primary TextButton all but vanished on its
  tertiaryContainer under a wallpaper scheme (both roles derive from the same wallpaper hues;
  fixed 2026-07-14 with onTertiaryContainer text + an inverse-fill confirm). The dynamic scheme is luminance-sanity-checked in VelaTheme (a ROM handing a
  light background for the dark scheme falls back to Vela colours - seen on GrapheneOS). NB
  Google Maps itself is a dynamic-colour HOLDOUT (M3 components, zero wallpaper tinting) -
  Vela tinting its chrome already exceeds it; the split is our own design call.
- **Basemap layer gotchas (`VelaMapView.ensureLayers`/`applyLight`/`applyDark`, OpenFreeMap Liberty).**
  (1) **`maxzoom` is EXCLUSIVE** - the bundled `building` FILL layer is `minzoom 13 / maxzoom 14`, so
  `setMinZoom(14f)` alone collapses its range to empty and the flat footprints never paint (you'd see only
  the faint `building-3d` extrusion). The fill needs a matching **`setMaxZoom(24f)`** to re-open the top;
  keep it. `building-3d` (fill-extrusion) is gated to **z16+** on purpose (the flat fill carries the
  browse-zoom footprint look; extrusion is the per-pixel-expensive part on a Pixel 5a). (2) **House
  numbers** render via the runtime `vela-housenumber` SymbolLayer (OMT `housenumber` source-layer, `minZoom 19` - numbers only at the ~50 ft scale-bar view; 17.5 still carpeted whole blocks, user 2026-07-13) - 
  OpenFreeMap **does** serve that source-layer (verified vs the live TileJSON + z14 tiles), so it works;
  coverage is OSM `addr:housenumber` (partial), not a render bug. The `vela-addr-*` overlay number
  layers anchor to `CONTROLS_CLAIM_LAYER` (above basemap labels, below the ambient icons) - NOT the
  visible `CONTROLS_LAYER`, which lives at the BOTTOM of the symbol stack since 2026-07-09; anchoring
  there sank the numbers under the building extrusions and every basemap label (the "numbers under
  the buildings" regression). (3) The runtime loads the style from the **LIVE** URL `MapStyle.LIBERTY.uri =
  https://tiles.openfreemap.org/styles/liberty` (`fromUri`), and offline downloads use the same URL - both
  **auto-follow OpenFreeMap's current tile snapshot**, so there is NO dated-path/blank-basemap risk. The
  bundled `liberty-roboto.json` asset (which DOES pin a dated `planet/<snapshot>` path) is **parked +
  unused** - the `asset://`/`fromJson` path in `VelaMapView` is dead code kept only as reference (a bundled
  copy blanked the vector tiles on-device; see the project memory). Don't be misled by the stale path in
  that asset. Verify basemap edits on-device in **both** themes. (3b) **Satellite deep zoom (2026-08-06, issue #244):** the base World_Imagery raster source is
  capped at `maxZoom 19` (Esri's safe global max) and MapLibre STRETCHES the z19 tile past that -
  the "blurry satellite" report. `MapViewModel.refreshSatDeep` probes Esri's `tilemap` availability
  index (1x1 cell at the view centre, levels 22→21→20, area-cached box, fetch-fail caches nothing)
  into `MapUiState.satDeep` (0 none / 20..22 Esri native level / -1 fallback), and
  `ensureSatelliteDeep` in VelaMapView adds ONE extra raster layer above the base imagery:
  Esri at its probed native level, or Google's `mt1.google.com/vt/lyrs=s` tiles (maxZoom 21) only
  where Esri tops out at 19 - Esri is deliberately the primary everywhere it has data (user call).
  The deep source id carries provider+level so an area change swaps the source instead of
  stretching a stale cap; Google upsamples rather than 404s outside cities (probed), so the
  fallback can't paint holes, and open-ocean 404s fall back to the overzoomed parent like any
  failed raster tile. The deep layer CROSS-FADES in (rasterOpacity 0 at z18.6 -> 1 at z19.6):
  Esri's z20+ metro tiles are a different capture program than the z17-19 mosaic, so the
  handover is an era/lighting flip in the DATA - the fade blends the seam like Google does
  (user noticed the pop, 2026-08-08). (4) **Road-name halos are
  WIDER than the blanket** (2026-07-09): applyDark/applyLight give the three `highway-name-*`
  symbol layers `textHaloWidth 1.9` vs the 1.1 every other label gets - route lines and the
  dotted walking line run right under street names and made them unreadable; the fatter halo
  is the "underlay tint" (Google does the same). Keep the exception if the blanket pass changes.
- **Voice search mic is tier-2 intent handoff, not in-process recording (2026-07-10).**
  `VoiceSearch` (reactive holder, pref `voice_search_button`) + a mic in `SearchBar` (param `onMic`,
  shown only when query is empty and `onMic != null`). MapScreen computes `onMic` = toggle on AND
  `VoiceSearch.hasProvider()` (a `queryIntentActivities(ACTION_RECOGNIZE_SPEECH)` check; needs the
  `<queries>` entry in the manifest for Android 11+ visibility). The tap fires
  `startActivityForResult(ACTION_RECOGNIZE_SPEECH)` and reads `EXTRA_RESULTS` into the query -
  **the provider records, so Vela needs NO RECORD_AUDIO for this tier.** KEY DISTINCTION verified
  2026-07-10: only apps that register the RECOGNIZE_SPEECH **activity** count (FUTO Voice Input
  does - confirmed in its manifest). **With several voice apps installed the launch resolution
  is a LADDER** (2026-07-10): the user's Settings pick (persisted as a flattened ComponentName,
  `voice_search_provider`) pins the intent; with no pick, the intent stays IMPLICIT so Android's
  own default-app choice routes it (a default set outside Vela is respected); only when Android
  has no default either (`resolveActivity` returns the package-"android" resolver) does Vela pin
  the FIRST installed app, so the system chooser can never interrupt a dictation. The Settings
  picker mirrors the ladder EXPLICITLY (2026-07-10): Vela Voice, then an "Android default" row
  (= the no-pick state, `clearProvider`), then every installed app BY NAME as manual overrides
  (`VoiceSearch.providers()`); an uninstalled pick degrades down the same ladder, never a dead
  mic. Legacy `Engine.LOCAL` pins migrate to AUTO at init (a LOCAL pin hid the mic entirely once
  the model was deleted, and the UI stopped offering LOCAL when the picker shipped). Keyboard/IME voice (Sayboard, FUTO Keyboard) provides a
  RecognitionService or in-IME mic, NOT the activity, so `queryIntentActivities` returns empty and
  the mic correctly hides - Vela can't `startActivityForResult` to them. That's intended: those
  users use the keyboard mic, and tier-1 (on-device Whisper) serves everyone regardless.
- **Voice search TIER-1 is on-device Whisper, in-process (2026-07-10, device-verified end to end).**
  The second path: Vela's own model records + transcribes on the phone, no other app. `WhisperRecognizer`
  (`:app/voice`) loads **Whisper tiny int8 multilingual + Silero VAD** through the bundled sherpa-onnx
  runtime (same AAR as Piper TTS - `OfflineRecognizer(config=...)` with `assetManager` defaulting null
  = filesystem load; VAD via `Vad(config=...)`), records with `AudioRecord` (VOICE_RECOGNITION, 16 kHz
  mono), feeds the VAD in 512-sample windows, and transcribes the detected speech segment. `AsrModel`
  (`:app/voice`) is the descriptor + install check (`filesDir/asr/whisper-tiny/`, 4 files present =
  installed). The **~47 MB model is a download-on-demand from the `asr-models` release** (built by
  `tools/build-asr-model.sh` = slim the upstream sherpa whisper-tiny to int8 + silero, tar.bz2;
  reuses `KokoroInstaller.download` + its no-call-timeout client). RECORD_AUDIO is asked **at point
  of use** (first mic tap), never for tier-2. `VoiceSearch.resolvedMode(context)` picks LOCAL / SYSTEM
  / NONE from the `voice_search_engine` pref (AUTO=on-device-wins / LOCAL / SYSTEM) x availability;
  MapScreen mirrors it reactively (keyed on `state.asrInstalled` so a fresh download flips the mic
  without relaunch). The capture UI is `VoiceCaptureDialog` (listening sheet, level ring, auto-focus
  Done - VelaDialog D-pad pattern). Settings -> Search has the download/remove + the engine picker
  (shown only when BOTH model and a provider exist). R8 keeps `com.k2fsa.sherpa.onnx.**` (already for
  Piper). Verified: download+install, mic appears, POU permission, VAD auto-stop, transcript -> query;
  Auto uses on-device, "Other voice app" launches the provider. **User-facing name is "Vela voice"**
  (2026-07-10): the model row, hint and picker all say Vela voice, and the picker is TWO options
  (Vela voice = AUTO, Other voice app = SYSTEM) - the explicit local-only third choice was dropped as
  jargon (Engine.LOCAL still exists, just not offered). **Whisper is PINNED to the app language**
  (`whisperLang()` = `AppLocale.effective().language` when in SUPPORTED, else auto; recognizer
  rebuilds if the language changes) - auto-detect transcribed a noisy far-field capture into
  CYRILLIC, don't revert to `language = ""`. **Transcripts are cleaned** (`cleanTranscript`): Whisper
  writes prose ("Coffee shops near me.") so terminal ./!/?/,/;/: and wrapping quotes are stripped;
  inner periods stay (St. Paul). The listening pulse uses tween(90) + 1.4x ring travel + a 7x RMS
  gain - the default spring smoothed the ~32 ms level updates into near-stillness. **The mic always shows when the toggle is on** (2026-07-10): with neither the model nor a provider, tapping it OFFERS the Vela voice download (VelaDialog in MapScreen -> `downloadAsrModel()`, the map shows the same VoiceDownloadCard) - a hidden mic made the feature undiscoverable. **The archive is tar.GZIP on `asr-models`** (58 MB vs 47 bz2): bzip2 unpacked at ~15 MB/s on-device (a ~30 s hang); gzip installs in ~2 s. `KokoroInstaller.extractTar` picks the decompressor by magic bytes (upstream Piper voices are still bz2). Accuracy of
  tiny-int8 is the known tradeoff for size/speed; a larger model could be a future catalog entry.
  **Pauses playing media while listening (2026-07-12):** `WhisperRecognizer.listen` takes
  `AUDIOFOCUS_GAIN_TRANSIENT` (an `AudioFocusRequest` with `USAGE_ASSISTANT`/`CONTENT_TYPE_SPEECH`)
  right before `audio.startRecording()` and abandons it in the `finally` after `audio.stop()`, so
  music/podcasts PAUSE (not just duck - `_TRANSIENT`, not `_MAY_DUCK`) while dictating and resume the
  instant the utterance ends. Only the in-process path needs it; tier-2 (SYSTEM) hands off to an
  external recognizer that manages its own focus. Recording itself (an input `AudioRecord`) is
  unaffected by the output-focus request.
- **ASR is CRASH-SENTINELED and voice failures EXPLAIN THEMSELVES (2026-07-23, ported from
  vela-dpad, credit ars18/alltechdev):** a truncated/corrupt engine archive makes sherpa-onnx ABORT
  natively (uncatchable - the process dies), and warmUp() runs at startup, so a bad model was an
  unrecoverable crash loop. `AsrRecognizer` bumps `asr_load_strikes_<id>` before every native load
  and zeroes it after; TWO stranded loads in a row latch `asr_model_bad_<id>`, delete THAT engine's
  dir only, and report not-installed (one stranded load is forgiven - a mid-load process kill
  strands the counter exactly like a crash, and must not delete a healthy 154 MB download). A fresh
  download clears its own quarantine (`clearQuarantine(engine)` in downloadAsrEngine). And
  `listen()` returns a `VoiceResult` (Text/NoSpeech/Failed(reason)) instead of String? - the seven
  failure exits used to collapse into one silent null; MapScreen now explains MODEL / PERMISSION /
  VAD / AUDIO_INIT / RECORDING in a VelaDialog with retry, and a DENIED mic prompt surfaces too.
  Transcript cleanup moved to `SpeechText.cleanSearchTranscript` (:core, unit-tested): strips
  Whisper's bracket tags ("[music]", incl. a truncated trailing "[musi") so junk collapses to
  no-speech instead of searching for the literal tag. Logcat tag `VELAASR` names every failure.
- **Tier-1 ASR is now a PICKABLE ENGINE, not Whisper-only (2026-07-20, device-verified on the P4a).**
  `WhisperRecognizer`→**`AsrRecognizer`** and `AsrModel`→**`AsrEngine`** (an enum catalog): three
  on-device engines share the sherpa-onnx runtime - **Whisper tiny** (`whisper`, multilingual default,
  58 MB), **SenseVoice** (`sense_voice`, en/zh/ja/ko/yue, 154 MB, `OfflineSenseVoiceModelConfig`
  useInverseTextNormalization=true), **Moonshine** (`moonshine`, English-only, 101 MB,
  `OfflineMoonshineModelConfig` 4-onnx). `AsrRecognizer.ensureRecognizer` builds the right
  `OfflineModelConfig` per engine and caches on `loadedKey="<engineId>|<lang>"` (rebuilds on engine OR
  language switch). Each archive is SELF-CONTAINED - `silero_vad.onnx` ships inside every
  `<id>/` folder, so the VAD travels with the engine. **Whisper stays `AsrEngine.DEFAULT`** so no
  language regresses; SenseVoice/Moonshine are opt-in. `AsrEngine.active(ctx)` = the picked engine if
  installed, else the first installed, else DEFAULT (pref `asr_engine` in `vela_settings`). Selection
  degrades gracefully: deleting the active engine falls back. State is `asrInstalledIds:Set<String>` +
  `asrActiveId` + `asrDownloadingId` (not the old `asrInstalled:Boolean`). Settings → Search now shows
  a **per-engine list** (each row: name, languages, size, Download/Use/Active/Remove), always visible
  (not gated on "model AND provider"). Models built by **`scripts/build-asr-model.sh <id>`** (repackage
  the upstream k2-fsa sherpa int8 prebuilt + inject the VAD from the Whisper archive → `vela-asr-<id>.tar.gz`
  on the `asr-models` release). The map's one-tap mic offer still installs the DEFAULT (Whisper). Note:
  SenseVoice pins the app language only when it's in {zh,en,ja,ko,yue}, else "auto"; Moonshine ignores
  language. Older single-model details above (WhisperRecognizer/AsrModel/asrInstalled) are superseded.
- **Location is requested in onboarding, NOT on map load (2026-07-10).** `MapScreen`'s
  `LaunchedEffect` only STARTS location when it's already granted; it no longer fires the raw
  system dialog. The first ask lives in `VelaRoot`: when onboarding reaches the location step
  (`Onboarding.showLocationPrompt`, armed by `completeWelcome`) a `LaunchedEffect` fires the raw
  Android permission dialog **directly** - no separate rationale screen, the `WelcomeScreen` is
  context enough for a maps app (user call 2026-07-10: one less thing to tap through). The result
  callback arms the voice step. Order: welcome → system location dialog → voice. A denial leaves
  search/browse working (the locate FAB `onRecenter` re-requests on tap); a **coarse-only** grant
  drives an approximate dot via the NETWORK provider (device-verified: COARSE granted / FINE denied
  advances the flow and the coarse fix path handles it). The `PermissionRationale` composable is
  kept (it's still the reusable pre-permission screen the **PR3 voice-search mic** uses at
  point-of-use for RECORD_AUDIO) - it's just no longer used for location. Don't re-request location
  straight from the map.
- **ONE stacked notification area on the map (2026-07-10).** The heads-up flash, download
  progress cards, the update card and pushed notices all render in the SAME TopCenter Column in
  MapScreen (each with its own dismiss) - the old separate status card sat on the category chips
  and painted over the update card. Position: browse = statusBar + 132dp (just under search bar +
  chips); during nav it hangs off the turn card's MEASURED bottom edge (`navBannerBottomPx`, the
  same onGloballyPositioned report the compass uses) + 10dp, so it slides with lane rows / the
  "then" row instead of a guessed fixed offset. AUDITED COMPLETE 2026-07-10: the FASTER-ROUTE
  offer during nav renders IN the column too (it used to sit at a fixed 96dp under the turn card),
  and the bottom PSDS tip is gated to the bare map + yields to the resume-nav card - every
  top-of-map card is in the one column; bottom cards (PSDS tip, resume-nav) are bare-map-only.
  The flash (`MapUiState.status`) shows in ANY map state; the other cards stay gated to the bare
  map, which INCLUDES during nav - a mid-drive voice/region download or update offer stacks under
  the faster-route/status cards instead of hiding. `statusVoiceAction` on the state marks a
  voice-problem flash: `InfoCard` then adds a filled **"Get a voice" pill** (UpdateCard layout)
  that deep-links Settings -> voice library (`MapScreen.onOpenVoiceSettings` -> VelaRoot ->
  `SettingsScreen(openVoiceLibrary = true)`). Both the no-engine warning and the
  missing-language hint carry it.
- **Spoken directions are a persistent toggle (2026-07-10).** Settings -> Voice top row
  ("Spoken directions", pref `spoken_directions` in vela_settings, default on) and the in-nav
  speaker button share ONE state: `MapViewModel.setSpokenDirections` writes the pref + `voice.muted`;
  `toggleVoice` routes through it; init applies the pref at startup. When it's OFF the no-voice-
  engine warning is suppressed (silence is chosen, don't nag).
- **Closing-time warning at nav start (2026-07-10).** `MapViewModel.maybeWarnClosingSoon` (called
  in `startNav` before launch/demo): when the drive's arrival (now + in-traffic ETA) lands within
  an hour of the destination's closing time, or past it, it warns ONCE - `flashStatus` heads-up
  card + `voice.speak` - "X closes at 9:00 PM and you arrive around 8:40 PM". Closing time is
  parsed from the place's own localized STATUS TEXT by `:core`'s `data/ClosingTime`
  (unit-tested): 12h and 24h shapes, last-time-token-wins, and it ONLY parses an OPEN place -
  a closed status carries opening times ("Closed - Opens 9 AM"), the classic mistake. A "12 AM"/
  "00:00" closing returns 1440 (tonight's midnight) so plain arithmetic works; a closing that
  reads earlier than now is treated as past-midnight (+24 h). Guards: the selected place must sit
  within 200 m of the route end (multi-stop trips whose last stop isn't the selected place skip
  the warning). NB on a device with NO TTS voice the later "no voice engine" hint overwrites the
  flash (single status slot) - with any voice installed the warning shows and is spoken.
- **Location-permission UX gates (2026-07-10).** Turn-by-turn REQUIRES precise location (coarse
  fixes are ~2 km; the nav fix discipline correctly refuses non-GPS and >50 m fixes, so nav on
  coarse sat at "Searching for GPS" forever with no explanation). `onStartNav` in MapScreen now
  gates on FINE: without it (and demo-drive off - `vm.demoDriveOn()` skips the gate since demo
  simulates), a VelaDialog explains and "Allow precise" fires the FINE+COARSE request, which Android
  renders as its approximate-to-precise UPGRADE dialog; on grant it starts location + continues
  through the notification gate into nav. Declining the upgrade toasts `nav_precise_toast`. The
  locate FAB's re-request now also handles the DEAD-BUTTON case: a fully-denied result (including
  Android's instant deny after "don't ask again") opens a dialog with an Open-settings deep link
  (ACTION_APPLICATION_DETAILS_SETTINGS). Device-verified end to end: Start on coarse -> gate ->
  upgrade dialog -> precise -> notification permission -> nav running.
- **Vague fixes draw an ACCURACY HALO (2026-07-10).** `MapUiState.myAccuracyM` carries the live
  fix's reported accuracy (null for sim/unknown); `applyData` draws a translucent meter-true disc
  (`ACCURACY_LAYER`, a 64-point polygon from `accuracyCircle`, fill #4285F4 at 0.22 + a 1.5 px edge
  LineLayer - 0.12-0.15 vanished into the dark basemap's own blue) under the dot
  when accuracy > `ACCURACY_HALO_MIN_M` (100 m) and NOT navigating. With a COARSE-ONLY permission
  MapScreen falls back to 2000 m when the fix hasn't reported accuracy yet (Android hands coarse
  apps a fix only every few minutes), and the recenter tap ZOOM-FITS the circle (at street zoom a
  2 km halo covers the whole screen as an invisible uniform wash; the blob only reads when its edge
  is on screen). **The fit works in DENSITY-INDEPENDENT px with the 512-tile constant
  (78271.517*cos(lat)/2^z m/dp, 2026-07-10)** - the first cut used physical px + the 256-tile
  constant, landed ~2.5 levels too close on a 2.75x-density phone, and the circle still overflowed
  the screen as the invisible wash (why "i am not seeing a large blob" persisted through a whole
  build). Device-verified: locate on coarse-only now frames the disc at ~70% of screen width with
  its edge line visible - so an approximate-only
  permission or a weak network fix reads as "somewhere in this blob" instead of a falsely precise
  dot, and ordinary GPS (3-30 m) stays a plain dot. Identity-gated like the other applyData uploads.
  Render verified on-device via a temporary forced-1500 m build (a real coarse fix is
  interval-throttled by Android, too slow to wait out in a test loop).
- **Onboarding is deliberately SHORT - four steps, no more (declutter 2026-07-10).** Welcome →
  location → notifications → voice, then the map. The notification step (2026-07-10, Android 13+
  only, `Onboarding.showNotifPrompt`) fires the raw POST_NOTIFICATIONS dialog right after the
  location result so turn-by-turn's next-turn notification works on the first drive; a denial gets
  ONE plain-words "Skip notifications?" are-you-sure (re-request on Allow, move on on Skip), and
  the nav-start point-of-use gate stays as the fallback for skippers/existing installs. The
  location step also grew a COARSE-ONLY branch: granting approximate pops an "Approximate
  location" dialog (what it means, nav won't work) whose "Allow precise" re-runs the request as
  Android's upgrade choice - asked ONCE (`approxAsked`), keeping it never nags again. The locate
  FAB's re-ask does the same via `showApproxNotice` in MapScreen. The old **offline-maps** onboarding prompt and the **diagnostics/
  trip-recording** onboarding prompt were CUT (they made a long wall of asks a first-run user has no
  context for). Both settings still exist, off by default, in Settings → Diagnostics + Offline; the
  diagnostics ask now surfaces **in context** on the crash-report card (Settings → Diagnostics only
  renders the card when a crash is pending) - a "Turn on diagnostics" button appears there when a
  crash is pending AND diagnostics is off, routing through the same `showDiagConsent` VelaDialog the
  toggle uses. `Onboarding` no longer has `showOfflinePrompt`/`showDiagPrompt` - don't re-add
  onboarding steps; if a feature needs a first-run nudge, prefer a contextual in-place ask like the
  crash card. NO Material You toggle in onboarding either (it's a Settings → Appearance opt-in).
- **VelaDialog: confirm is a filled pill, dismiss is a text button (2026-07-10).** The `DialogButton`
  `filled` flag (set on the confirm button in `VelaDialog`) draws the higher-emphasis action as a
  primary `CircleShape` pill (onPrimary text); the dismiss stays a plain text button, quieted further
  to `onSurfaceVariant` when `dismissLowEmphasis`. One change in `VelaDialog`, so EVERY dialog (voice,
  location, diagnostics consent, trip consent, …) gets the pill - don't hand-roll per-dialog buttons.
  The map's UpdateCard uses the same treatment (2026-07-10): its Update action is a filled primary
  CircleShape `Button` beside a plain "Not now" text button, so the action reads by shape and fill,
  not text colour alone (colour-blind safe). Give any future card's primary action the same pill.
  The button row is a **`FlowRow`** (not `Row`): when the two labels don't fit on one line (a long
  "Download Vela voice" pill beside "Use system voice", or a small/feature-phone screen) the confirm
  pill wraps to its OWN full-width line instead of being squeezed and breaking mid-word. Both buttons
  keep the D-pad ring/focus (dismiss auto-focuses, confirm by arrow); the pill ring follows CircleShape.
- **D-pad-only operation is a hard UI rule (2026-07-07, `docs/dpad.md`).** The whole app
  works with a 5-key D-pad and NO touchscreen (touch is a bonus). Helpers in
  `app/ui/DpadFocus.kt` (`rememberDpadMode`/`rememberNoTouchDevice`/`Modifier.dpadHighlight`/
  `Modifier.dpadFieldEscape` - makes a text field's UP/DOWN escape it instead of
  being swallowed as a cursor move, so controls below the field stay reachable - and
  `rememberDpadAutoFocus()` - attach its `FocusRequester` to a screen's primary element so
  focus is PLACED on appearance, no wake-up keypress; retries because the node isn't attached
  on frame 1);
  the map is key-driven via `app/ui/map/MapDpadController.kt` (wired in `VelaMapView`, key
  handling + crosshair + zoom buttons in `MapScreen`).
  **AdaptiveDensity (2026-07-13, from the vela-dpad fork by ars18/alltechdev):** `ui/AdaptiveDensity.wrap`
  (chained FIRST in both `attachBaseContext`s) shrinks the app's effective density so tiny feature-phone
  screens report >= 360dp of logical width - chips/dialogs/rows fit instead of clipping. It is a HARD
  NO-OP at >= 360dp (ordinary phones byte-identical); tuned visually on 240x320-class flip phones by the
  fork author. Same commit brought `Modifier.dpadAutoFocus(requester)` (confirm-until-landed retry on a
  caller-owned requester - the weak rememberDpadAutoFocus can bail before focus actually lands) and the
  Settings DOWN-from-Back bridge (TopAppBar -> content Column crossing clears focus otherwise).
  **Detection is CONSERVATIVE - do not loosen it (fixed 2026-07-08).** `rememberDpadFirstDevice`
  (`detectDpadFirst`) returns true ONLY for a genuinely touchless device (`!FEATURE_TOUCHSCREEN`)
  or a PHYSICAL (non-virtual) `InputDevice` with `SOURCE_DPAD`. It must NOT count the framework's
  Virtual aggregate device (id −1): it reports `KEYBOARD | DPAD` on essentially every phone
  (verified on a Pixel 9 via `dumpsys input`), so counting it made `dpadMode` always-true on
  ordinary phones and BROKE the search bar (a tap no longer opened the field / raised the keyboard;
  the `+`/`−` zoom buttons showed under touch). A fake-touchscreen keypad phone is NOT D-pad-first
  then; it gets full D-pad operation reactively on the first key via `rememberDpadMode`
  (`dpadFirst || inputMode == Keyboard`). The soft keyboard in `SearchBar` is likewise keyed off the
  LIVE `inputMode`, not the static device type, so a touch tap raises it even on a hybrid phone. See
  docs/dpad.md. Rules when touching UI: (1) every new
  interactive element must be focusable with a visible ring (`dpadHighlight`) and every new
  gesture needs a key alternative; (2) D-pad code CALLS THE TOUCH PATHS (the named `handleTap`
  lambda, `gestureMove`, `navUserZoom`) - never fork them; (3) all D-pad affordances gate on
  `dpadMode`/`noTouch` so touch UX stays byte-identical; (4) keep the diff merge-friendly - 
  new behaviour in new files, shared-file edits as small anchored insertions (the one
  commented import block per file). Search-overlay focus is subtle (armed field + explicit
  `searchExpanded` flag - THREE traps documented in docs/dpad.md: opens-on-focus,
  can't-BACK-out, and DOWN-must-escape-into-the-suggestions); don't "simplify" it back to
  bare field-focus. The full-app D-pad sweep (2026-07-07) also made Choose-on-map keep the
  map pannable to place the pin (a `pickOnMap` exception in `mapTargetHidden`) and scroll-cap
  the directions panel so **Start** is reachable with 4 alternates (helps touch too). The one
  raw WebView in the app - the full-screen "Read all reviews" panel (`ReviewsPanel`,
  `fullScreen`) - maps ↑/↓ to `pageUp`/`pageDown` + `requestFocus()`es so it scrolls by D-pad
  (a WebView's default is to hop focus between links, not scroll); reach/exit are proven, exit
  is always hardware BACK via the `Dialog`'s `BackHandler`. **D-pad-FIRST initial focus is a
  hard rule (sweep 2026-07-07): NO screen/view may open with nothing focused** - a wasted
  first keypress is the bug. Compose doesn't give this for free (focus recovery is
  nondeterministic - the place sheet landed on a photo / the search bar / nowhere), so every
  screen attaches `rememberDpadAutoFocus()` to a primary element (Settings→back, Welcome→Get
  started, place sheet→handle, directions→Drive tab, steps→first row, reviews→back arrow);
  the map + photo gallery already self-focus. When adding a screen, give it an auto-focus
  target. **Menus & dialogs (the hard one): a Compose `DropdownMenu` Popup / `AlertDialog` can
  NOT be pre-focused (~10 approaches proven to fail - requestFocus/moveFocus/synthetic KeyEvent);
  only a hand-built RAW `Dialog` with an explicit `.focusable()` element auto-focuses.** So use
  **`VelaMenu`** (`ui/VelaMenu.kt`, drop-in DropdownMenu: anchored DropdownMenu under touch,
  auto-focusing raw-Dialog chooser under D-pad) and **`VelaDialog`** (`ui/VelaDialog.kt`, drop-in
  two-button AlertDialog that auto-focuses its dismiss button) - NEVER a bare `DropdownMenu`/
  `AlertDialog` for new D-pad UI. Their buttons/items focus via `.focusable()`+`.onKeyEvent`
  (OK) + `pointerInput` (touch), NOT `.clickable` (whose nested focusable won't take requestFocus
  in a Dialog window).
- **Localization (i18n) is three layers, one control (`AppLocale`, `ui/`, same process-wide reactive
  holder shape as `AppTheme`).** `AppLocale.language` = "" (follow system) or a code; Settings → Language
  picks it. (1) **Spoken nav** - the GENERATED turn-by-turn text is a per-language `NavStrings` table in
  `:core` (`core/i18n`), switched by `NavStringsRegistry`; `AppLocale.apply()` drives it. **BOTH routers feed
  it:** `RouteGeometry.osrmPhrase` (online OSRM) AND `GraphHopperRouteEngine.ghPhrase` (offline) map their
  maneuvers to the OSRM `(type, mod)` token pair and call `NavStringsRegistry.current().phrase(...)`, so
  offline routes localize through the same 11 tables (ghPhrase used to hardcode English - audit 2026-07-06).
  **The chosen neural
  voice must actually speak that language** - `VoiceGuide` guards on `NeuralSynth.voiceLanguage` and, on a
  mismatch, falls back to a system TTS in the target language (or stays silent + fires a "get a matching voice"
  hint) rather than reading, e.g., Russian nav text through the English Piper model (see the voice bullet under
  Degoogled constraints). **Foreign NAME romanizing (issue #184, 2026-07-20):** a road NAME can be in a
  different script than the guidance language (Hebrew name inside English guidance), and a single-language
  voice drops those glyphs. `SpokenScript.forVoice(text, voiceLang)` romanizes to Latin (android.icu
  `Any-Latin; Latin-ASCII`) any run in a script the SPEAKING voice can't read, applied around `forSpeech()`
  in BOTH speak paths; SPOKEN string only, the banner keeps the local script. **Latin is the universal
  fallback for EVERY voice, not just Latin-script ones (un-scoped 2026-07-19, user: a Chinese driver in
  Israel wants Latin, not dropped Hebrew - that is what Google does):** each voice keeps only its OWN
  native script (`VOICE_SCRIPT` maps he/ar/ru/el/th/hi/ko/zh/ja to their script; everything else = Latin),
  so a Russian voice keeps Cyrillic but romanizes Hebrew, and a Chinese voice keeps Han but romanizes
  Hebrew/Cyrillic. CJK Han/kana are the ONE exception - never romanized for any voice (ICU reads Han as
  Chinese pinyin, "明治通り"->"ming zhitongri" not "Meiji-dori"), left to the native CJK voices. NB a
  CJK/Cyrillic voice reading romanized Latin is rough (their G2P is not built for Latin), but audible beats
  dropped; the clean win is the DISPLAY side (name:latin), pending. Logic is unit-tested with an injected
  romanizer (android.icu is JVM-stubbed in unit tests); real ICU output validated via `uconv` (same libicu).
  **REAL romanized names beat ICU (2026-07-19, tiles phase):** ICU on an abjad like Hebrew is a vowel-less
  skeleton ("רחוב הרצל"->"rhwb hrzl"), unpronounceable. Real names are DATA: the OpenMapTiles
  basemap carries `name:en`/`name:latin` per road. `VelaMapView`'s existing nav-label pass
  (querySourceFeatures over `transportation_name`) also records `localName -> latinAliasOf(feature)`
  and reports it via `onNavRoadLatin` -> `MapViewModel.onNavRoadLatin` -> `MapUiState.roadNameLatin` +
  `VoiceGuide.roadNameLatin`, growing as tiles load, reset on nav end. **The dict query is WARMUP-paced,
  NOT the per-400 m quantum the label pass uses:** a drive STARTS with only the route-overview (low-zoom)
  tiles loaded, which carry ONLY major road names (device-proven: dict=19 major roads at nav start), so the
  first turn onto a minor road spoke the ICU skeleton. The loop now re-queries the dict every 2 s tick WHILE
  it is still growing (`dictStaleTicks < 3`, reset on each quantum), so a local road's real name lands within
  a couple seconds of its nav-zoom tile loading (device-proven: dict jumped 19 -> 404 as local streets
  resolved to real romanized names with vowels, not the consonant skeleton, on both the banner and the
  voice). The expensive crossing geometry stays per-quantum, so this never puts a heavy pass on the
  every-frame path. The nav-start OPENER ("Starting navigation. Head ... on <road>") is spoken via
  `VoiceGuide.speakOpener` (not `speak`): it HOLDS the opener up to `OPENER_MAX_WAIT_MS` (2.5 s), retrying
  every 200 ms until the road it names is covered by `roadNameLatin` (or the text has no foreign run), then
  speaks - the drive begins before nav-zoom tiles load, so speaking at T=0 read the ICU skeleton; the wait
  lets the dict fill so the opener says the real name (device-proven: opener spoke the real romanized road,
  not the skeleton, once the dict reached ~400). `stop()` bumps `openerToken` to cancel a still-waiting
  opener. An English opener never waits (hasForeignRun false).
  **On-MAP labels romanize too (2026-07-19):** the maneuver banner/voice were romanized, but the nav
  road-name BUBBLES (`ensureNavRoadLabels`, `textField(get("name"))`) and the browse basemap street
  labels (`highway-name-*` in all four `applyLight`/`applyDark`/classic palette fns) still drew the
  local script (user: "why are the street name bubbles in jew still when we have english set"). Both now
  use `roadLabelTextField()` = `coalesce(get("name:en"), get("name:latin"), get("name"))` for a
  Latin-script UI (gate `uiWantsLatinLabels()` / `NON_LATIN_UI_LANGS`; a Hebrew/Russian/etc UI keeps the
  local `name`). Same name:latin tile data as the voice/banner, so labels + guidance agree. The nav-bubble
  filter still matches on the canonical `name` (Hebrew) - display latin, filter on name. NB the search-result
  markers + transit-stop labels stay on `name` (those are place-name DATA, not streets - a Hebrew business
  keeps its Hebrew name like Google).
  `SpokenScript.forVoice(text, lang, dict)` swaps a known local name for its real Latin form FIRST, ICU only
  for the rest; `SpokenScript.forDisplay(text, uiLang, dict)` does the same for the banner + steps but with
  NO ICU fallback (a skeleton on a sign reads broken - why the earlier ICU display romanization was
  reverted; an unmapped name keeps local script). Both gate on the UI/voice's own script (a Hebrew UI keeps
  Hebrew). Works ONLINE and in a downloaded map AREA (both carry name:latin tiles). Quality tracks OSM
  name:en coverage (Israel well-tagged -> real names; sparse areas keep local script on display / ICU by
  voice), same as Google.
  **OFFLINE across a whole state = a ROMANIZED-NAME SIDECAR next to the routing graph (2026-07-19,
  branch offline-roadnames; chosen over baking into the GraphHopper graph, which GraphHopper can't do
  natively without version-locked internals + a full re-download):** `scripts/roadnames_build.py` extracts
  `<local>\t<English>` for every road with name:en/name:latin from the region PBF (name:en wins; validated
  Latin-script, != local); `scripts/build-routing-region.sh` gzips it to `<id>-names.tsv.gz`, uploads it
  beside the graph on the `routing-graphs` release, and adds `namesUrl`/`namesSizeKb` to the manifest
  entry (merge script carries extra fields as-is; old apps ignore them). App: `RoutingGraphStore.download`
  pulls the sidecar into `graphs/<id>/names.tsv.gz` (best-effort, never fails the graph); `roadNames()`
  merges all installed regions' sidecars; `MapViewModel.offlineRoadNames` loads it at init / after a
  region download or delete and is the BASE for `roadNameLatin` (voice + state) that the online tiles
  merge ON TOP of, reset to on nav-end. So the graph is UNCHANGED (additive, existing downloads keep
  working, users grab a small extra file, not a new graph). Memory note: the merged map is held in
  memory while installed - a whole COUNTRY download could be tens of MB; per-route region loading is a
  future optimization. **The sidecars only exist after a `routing-graphs.yml` rebake is dispatched** (the
  bake is user-triggered; until then offline nav keeps the local script / ICU).
  (2) **UI chrome** - 
  all ~330 user-facing `:app` strings live in `res/values/strings.xml` (English) + `res/values-<lang>/` for
  the 14 translated languages (fr de es it pt nl ru pl sv uk iw + zh zh-rTW ja; CJK added 2026-07-11, Hebrew 2026-07-13),
  referenced via `stringResource`/`getString`. **CJK notes (2026-07-11):** Chinese ships as
  `values-zh` (Simplified, also the fallback for any zh region without its own folder) +
  `values-zh-rTW` (Traditional, Taiwan wording - issue #55); the in-app picker codes are "zh",
  "zh-TW" and "ja" and hyphenated codes MUST resolve via `Locale.forLanguageTag` (a `Locale("zh-TW")`
  constructor makes a bogus lowercase LANGUAGE and matches nothing - AppLocale.effective/wrap do this).
  `NavStringsRegistry.tagOf(locale)` splits Chinese by SCRIPT (Hant script or TW/HK/MO country ->
  the zh-tw table, else zh); `localized()` mirrors it for the scrape (`hl=zh-TW` vs `hl=zh-CN` -
  bare hl=zh is Simplified). `parseOpenNow` keys stay the bare "zh" with BOTH scripts' keywords in
  one table. TTS: ONE Mandarin Piper voice (`zh_CN-huayan-medium`, langCode "zh") pairs with both
  Chinese tables; **Japanese has NO Piper voice** - ja spoken guidance rides VoiceGuide's
  system-TTS-in-target-language fallback (silent + hint when none installed); a non-Piper sherpa
  ja model is the follow-up (needs PiperSynth config work, see ROADMAP). Whisper dictation pins
  zh/ja automatically (multilingual tiny; whisperLang reads `.language`, so zh-TW dictates as zh).
  **TWO CJK build traps that a warm Gradle daemon HIDES locally but CI catches (2026-07-11):**
  (1) in a Kotlin string template, `"$road出发"` parses `road出发` as ONE identifier (CJK chars
  are valid in Kotlin identifiers) -> "unresolved reference"; ALWAYS brace a `$var` that touches a
  CJK char: `"${road}出发"`. (2) in strings.xml a raw apostrophe (`app's`, `l'ancien`) is an AAPT
  error the RELEASE resource merge rejects even though a cached debug build passed; escape as `\'`
  (the whole file already does). Both slipped a local `:core:test`/`assembleDebug` because the
  daemon reused stale outputs - trust CI, or `--rerun-tasks` when touching these.
  The runtime switch is `AppLocale.wrap(context)` (overrides the Configuration locale; when FOLLOWING
  the system it also RESTORES `Locale.setDefault` to the captured device locale - the override is
  process-global and survived the recreate, so switching Russian back to English left
  `Locale.getDefault()`-driven surfaces (parking/trip dates via SimpleDateFormat, `effective()`,
  the scrape `hl=`) stuck in Russian until the process died; fixed 2026-07-10) applied in **both** `MainActivity.attachBaseContext` (Compose
  UI) and `VelaApp.attachBaseContext` (ViewModel/notification `getString`); changing the language calls
  `recreate()`. (3) **Google POI content** - the scrape's `hl=en` is rewritten to the app/system language
  at request time (`GoogleMapsDataSource.localized()`, no-op for English) so categories/hours/status/price
  come back localized. **The rewrite is GATED to `SearchParser.STATUS_LANGS` (= the 11 keyword-table
  languages, keyed off `CLOSED_WORDS`)** - for any OTHER locale the scrape stays `hl=en`, because a
  status string in a language `parseOpenNow` can't read leaves openNow null forever and the UI can't
  colour open/closed; English text the English table handles is the safer fallback (audit 2026-07-06).
  The **open/closed BOOLEAN is parsed from the localized status TEXT against a
  per-language keyword table** (`SearchParser.parseOpenNow(status, lang)`, `lang` = the same
  `Locale.getDefault()` that set `hl=`; CLOSED words are matched FIRST - "Opens 5 AM" / "Ouvre à 07:00" /
  "Fechado" / "Opent om 9:00" are prefix-cousins of the open words, and open-first matching is exactly
  what painted a closed Starbucks green). **Do NOT resurrect the numeric status-code path**
  (`openFromCode`, paths `statusCodeRich`/`statusCodeSimple`, removed 2026-07-04): a live EN capture
  proved those ints are span/style markers, not open/closed codes (closed pharmacies carried "open" 6,
  an Open-24-hours place carried 13/4 and rendered red) - the hl=fr pin agreeing was a coincidence.
  `placeStatusColor(status, openNow)` colours from the boolean and refuses to green English text that
  literally reads closed even if fed `openNow=true`. **`gl` (region) follows the PHONE's region
  (2026-07-14):** `GoogleMapsDataSource.glRegion` (set by the VM at init from the cell network's
  country, locale fallback) rewrites `gl=us` in `regionalized()` - clean 2-letter codes only, US
  phones byte-identical; region tunes ranking/bias, not response shape. **Dual-purpose literals
  stay inline on purpose** (NB the REVIEW SORT menu + the place-sheet TAB titles were split
  2026-07-14: localized display labels over English logic keys - the sort KEY must stay English
  because it drives the live hl=en Google panel by clicking the matching option) - 
  strings that double as a logic key (place "Open"/"Closed" → status-colour parser, the map category chips /
  search-along-route chips are also the query, review sort/tab labels branch a `when`) are NOT in strings.xml;
  they localize only once display text is split from the logic key. **Names/addresses/reviews are DATA - never
  translated.** **Translations flow through WEBLATE now (2026-07-14, docs/TRANSLATING.md):** adding a
  user-facing string means adding it to the ENGLISH base `values/strings.xml` only - translators fill the
  locales via hosted Weblate (its PRs are reviewed like any other; the em-dash + placeholder rules are the
  review checklist) and a missing translation falls back to English. Hand-filling every `values-<lang>/` in
  the same commit (the old rule) is still fine for small batches but no longer required. Match the
  `%1$s`/`%2$d` placeholder TYPE to the arg (Int → `%d`, else `%s`; a `%d` fed a String crashes).
  **Count strings use `<plurals>`, not a bare `%d X` (2026-07-11, issue #56 "1 results"):** the
  results-count bar is a `<plurals name="mapscreen_results_count">` read via `pluralStringResource(...,
  n, n)`. Use the CORRECT CLDR categories PER LANGUAGE - en/de/es/it/pt/nl/sv/fr = `one`+`other`
  (sv "resultat" is invariable); ru/uk/pl need `one`+`few`+`many`+`other` (e.g. ru результат/
  результата/результатов/результата). Any NEW "N &lt;noun&gt;" that can equal 1 (reviews, stops,
  places) should become a plural the same way; `place_review_count`/`place_transit_stops` are still
  bare and are the follow-up.
  **No em dashes in translations** (swept 2026-07-10): the 10 locale files carried 100+ of them as
  clause glue (plus German/Swedish spaced en dashes used the same way) - they read as machine-
  translation tells. Use a comma, a colon, or rephrase; the one legitimate dash is the numeric
  range in `place_usually_range`. Same rule as the rest of the repo.

- **README voice demo (`docs/voice-demo.mp4`, 2026-07-10).** A ~5.5 s clip of the ACTUAL nav
  voice linked from README's "What you get": generated OFF-DEVICE with the same engine + model +
  pace the app uses (pip `sherpa-onnx`, upstream `vits-piper-en_US-hfc_female-medium`,
  `length_scale=1.25` = the app's 0.8x default), then muxed to MP4 as a SHORT BLACK 640x120 STRIP
  (ffmpeg lavfi color source + aac) - a black frame keeps the README player compact and makes the
  controls (especially unmute) obvious; the earlier nav-screenshot poster rendered picture-sized. The render uses the app's PiperSynth OVERRIDES
  (noiseScale 0.45, noiseScaleW 0.55, speed 0.8) - the library-default noise scales sounded
  audibly different from the app (user caught it). MP4 not wav ON PURPOSE: GitHub's blob viewer renders a
  real PLAYER for mp4 but only a download link for wav (user hit that), and in-repo media in
  README markdown NEVER embeds inline (verified empirically on a test branch - bare raw/blob mp4
  URLs render as plain <a> links; only user-attachments URLs inline). The README NOW embeds an
  INLINE PLAYER via a user-attachments URL minted PROGRAMMATICALLY (2026-07-10): on the
  github.com new-issue page, same-origin fetch the repo's own raw mp4 into an ArrayBuffer, build
  a File + DataTransfer, dispatch a synthetic ClipboardEvent('paste') on the "Markdown value"
  textarea - GitHub's uploader consumes it and inserts the permanent
  github.com/user-attachments/assets/<uuid> URL (draft abandoned, nothing posted). If the demo is
  ever regenerated, repeat that mint and swap the URL in README - the old attachment URL keeps
  serving the OLD audio forever. The
  line is deliberately spelled/punctuated for the TTS ("in a quarter mile, turn right onto main
  street; then, at the roundabout, download vella!" - "vella" so espeak says the name right, the
  semicolon for the pause contour). Regenerate the same way if the default voice/pace changes. README feature copy rule: "What you get" is
  the HUMAN-GLANCE list (what people care about, plain sentences); FEATURES.md is the complete
  record; the README Roadmap holds only OPEN items. Screenshot rules (user 2026-07-10): the NAV
  shot leads the table, the transit shot shows the SCHEDULE BOARD with the ambient
  transit-lines layer toggled OFF for the shot (the purple lines over the map read as ugly; the
  schedules themselves are liked), and Install sits directly UNDER
  the screenshots. **Full retake 2026-07-16 (supersedes the Pixel 9 browse shots):** all 11
  shots (incl. the new 11-stop-list.png bus route timeline) shot on the 4a 5G with SystemUI
  demo mode (clock 1200, battery 100, icons hidden) and sim-location at the Davis fixture
  spots. **Shoot AFTER 11:30 AM Pacific**: the open/closed badge is decided by Google's
  servers at request time, so a spoofed clock can't make a closed Mikuni read "Open" - the
  demo clock only needs to AGREE with real time (noon clock, midday shoot, arrival times and
  departure boards all stay coherent). Camera counts on the route picker need Avoid
  surveillance cameras ON for the shot (restore OFF after). The site (site/assets/*.webp)
  carries the same shots at 720px q82. Site assets are ALL bundled locally (no hotlinks -
  the page makes zero external requests): the Obtainium/F-Droid badges are committed copies
  in site/assets/, and site/assets/voice-demo.m4a is the audio track extracted from
  docs/voice-demo.mp4 (`ffmpeg -vn -c:a copy`) - regenerate it whenever the voice demo is
  re-rendered. No Android Auto on the site yet (user 2026-07-16, not confident it works).

## Brand assets (2026-07-23)

One mark everywhere: the two-tone NAV CHEVRON (notched arrowhead, white left
half + `#39e0c8` right half) on the `#0d3d43` to `#149387` gradient. The
user's explicit pick (2026-07-23) after three rounds: sailboat variants, a
pin, a route-V, a constellation and a puck-in-circle were all considered and
rejected; they wanted the nav-arrow paradigm, two-toned, with NO circle, NO
star, NO pin. Canonical file is `docs/logo.svg` (512, rounded square). Derived copies that must stay in sync
when the mark changes: the launcher adaptive icon
(`drawable/ic_launcher_foreground.xml` + `ic_launcher_background.xml` gradient +
`ic_launcher_monochrome.xml` for themed icons - a hollow OUTLINE stroke, not a
fill, per the user 2026-07-23; the old
`@color/ic_launcher_background` is gone), the site navbar mark + favicon data
URI (`site/index.html`), and the README hero. The README hero also carries the
shields badge row + quick-nav links + website button (bambuddy-style); badge
URLs are shields.io (README only - the SITE stays zero-external-requests).
The GitHub social-preview image is uploaded manually in repo Settings and does
NOT live in the repo - re-upload it if the mark changes.

## README layout rule (2026-07-11)

The README stays SHORT: pitch, screenshots, install, what-you-get, the **privacy comparison
matrix** (kept IN the README - user 2026-07-11, it's the sharpest one-glance pitch), build.
Deep dives live in docs/ and get a pointer line, not a section: the capability/method
**how-it-works table lives in `docs/HOW-IT-WORKS.md`** (moved out 2026-07-11, README just links
it), alongside CALIBRATION.md, MAP-STYLE.md, dpad.md. The Roadmap section carries a "Not going
to happen" split for login/backend features - keep new won't-dos there AND in ROADMAP.md.
Remote calibration is a HEADLINE feature in What-you-get (the self-healing pitch), not just an
architecture note.

- **Calibration word-table overrides were DEAD until 2026-07-19:** `Calibration` had
  statusClosedWords/statusOpenWords/transitCategoryWords/transitExcludeWords/stopBoardIndices
  and the app pushed them into the parsers, but `CalibrationStore.parse()` never read them from
  JSON, so every remote bundle silently dropped them. Wired now (lenient like tuning), BUT any
  build released before this date cannot take a word-table override - a keyword fix for the
  installed fleet still needs an app release until those builds age out. When adding a new
  Calibration field, the parse() wiring is a separate step that WILL be forgotten unless you
  grep for the field name in CalibrationStore.
- **Hebrew status strings are "המקום"-prefixed (2026-07-19):** Google serves "המקום סגור ..."
  ("the place is closed"), not bare "סגור", so parseOpenNow's startsWith needed the prefixed
  forms in CLOSED_WORDS/OPEN_WORDS (keys "iw" AND "he"). Pinned by PlaceStatusTest with live
  strings from an il-device diag. If another language shows openNow=null on every place, check
  the real status text for a carrier phrase before its keyword.
- **Search bias sanity (2026-07-19):** a no-GPS device (WiFi tablet) never moves the camera off
  MapLibre's 0,0 default, and search/suggest biased to null island. `plausibleBias()` in
  MapViewModel discards any bias point within ~50 km of 0,0 - keep new "near" consumers behind
  it. **Rank-from-you (2026-08-08, the "results ordered around some weird point" report):**
  `MapDataSource.search` grew `rankFrom` - the point the result ORDER and shown distances are
  computed from; the pb REQUEST bias stays `near` (the viewport is still the search area).
  `MapViewModel.rankBias(near)` passes the user's location when it is within ~50 km of the
  viewport, so a local search sorts and labels distances from YOU instead of reshuffling
  around wherever the screen is centred; browsing a far city keeps viewport-centre ranking.
  Wired at runSearch + the suggest fetch; searchAlongRoute keeps its route-midpoint bias.
- **Local suggestions (issue #180, 2026-07-19):** `onQueryChange` sets `localSuggestions` from
  `localMatches()` SYNCHRONOUSLY (recents searches + viewed places + list/saved places, substring
  match; min 2 chars) BEFORE the debounced network fetch. **+ CONTACTS (issue #243, 2026-08-08,
  device-verified):** opt-in Settings > Search toggle (`ContactsSearch` holder, pref
  `contacts_search`, OFF by default; READ_CONTACTS asked at the point of use, flipping the toggle
  on, from SearchSettings). `app/data/ContactAddresses` loads ALL address-bearing contacts into
  memory ONCE (VM init + toggle-on, off-main) because localMatches runs synchronously per
  keystroke and a ContactsProvider binder query there would jank; the match is against that cache.
  A CONTACT suggestion carries the ADDRESS as its `query`, so picking it rides the normal
  searchRecent path (address searched exactly as if typed - the contact list itself never leaves
  the phone; PRIVACY.md has the user-facing wording). Kind.CONTACT icon = person - that is why they are instant and the only thing that
  shows offline. `LocalSuggestion` (kind RECENT_QUERY / RECENT_PLACE / SAVED_PLACE) renders above
  the network rows in `SearchEntryContent`. Dedup of network vs local is by `nameLocKey` (name +
  coarse location), NOT feature id - SavedPlace-backed locals carry no id, so an id-only compare
  double-shows them. Clear `localSuggestions` everywhere `suggestions` clears. **Press-hold / ⋮
  menu on a suggestion (issue #180, 2026-07-19):** every suggestion row (local AND network) now
  has a trailing ⋮ overflow plus a long-press (`SuggestionRow` gained `onLongClick` + a `trailing`
  slot; the row uses `combinedClickable`), both opening a `VelaMenu` via `SuggestionOverflow` -
  "Save to list" for any place-backed row (reuses PlaceSheet's `SaveToListSheet`, made `internal`)
  and "Remove from history" for removable rows. The ⋮ is the D-pad key path for the long-press
  (touch-only), so it stays D-pad-legal. The ⋮ REPLACES the bare X on local rows; the empty-query
  recents list keeps its own X. Menu open-state is `remember(suggestion)`-keyed so a keystroke
  that rebuilds the list closes a stranded menu.

- **Interface size (2026-07-11):** `UiScale` holder (pref `ui_scale`, chips 90/100/115/130% in
  Settings -> Appearance) applied as a LocalDensity override around VelaRoot's whole tree - all
  Compose UI scales, the map AndroidView keeps native size (built for car/vertical screens).
- **Map colours are Google-verbatim (2026-07-11):** greens/water/land sampled from
  maps.google.com at the arboretum. LIGHT: park/grass `#d3f8e2`, wood `#c9f2da`, water
  `#90daee`, land `#f2f1ee` - opaque (the old 0.3-0.7 over land washed them olive). DARK: park
  green was `#1c3326`, DARKER than the `#242f3e` navy land so it vanished (user 2026-07-11) -
  now `#2c4a34`/`#274330`, opaque, clearly readable. Re-sample the same way if either drifts.
  The **Map style Settings row was removed** (only one style ships; MapStyle/setStyle plumbing
  kept for a future re-add). Nav card trip time is a `FitText` (shrinks to fit, never wraps/
  ellipsises) so the 54dp buttons + Interface-size scale can't clip the arrival time.
- **Map COLOUR SETS (2026-07-11): Settings -> Appearance -> "Map colors" picks Modern or
  Classic.** `ui/MapColors` holder (pref `map_palette`; init in VelaApp); `applyMapTheme`
  dispatches to `applyLight`/`applyDark` (Modern, the pixel-sampled palette) or
  `applyClassicLight`/`applyClassicDark` (the archived 071c6c3 look from docs/MAP-STYLE.md -
  white roads, faded casings, yellow motorways, true greens). The styleKey carries
  `|pal=` so a switch reloads the style like a theme flip. Post-archive twin layers
  (trails/bikeroutes/pitch/commercial) get harmonious colours in the classic fns - they exist
  in ensureLayers regardless of palette, and an unstyled LineLayer renders BLACK, so any NEW
  twin layer must be coloured in ALL FOUR apply fns. **Same trap bit the maxspeed "Speed B" query
  layer (fixed 2026-07-13):** its `lineColor("#00000000")` 8-digit-hex string was REJECTED by
  MapLibre's colour parser and fell back to the default OPAQUE BLACK - a 12dp black stripe over
  every road on the browse map (device report). **BUT opacity 0 kills the query (2026-07-13, found by ars18 in the
  vela-dpad fork, A/B-proven on device):** MapLibre skips fully transparent features at render
  time and queryRenderedFeatures only sees rendered features, so the transparent Speed B layer
  returned NOTHING and the badge was dead from the moment the black-roads fix landed. An
  invisible-but-queryable layer needs `lineColor(Color.BLACK)` + `lineOpacity(0.004f)` (one alpha
  step - invisible on any basemap, still queryable), and only ADD it while it's needed. **`speedOverlayOn` is MOTION-ARMED (`speedOverlayArmed` in MapScreen, 2026-07-13):**
  armed the moment `navigating || mySpeed > 3 m/s`, disarmed after 2 min of stillness - NEVER keyed on
  `driveFollowing` alone. driveFollowing is true on the bare browse map (followMe defaults on), and
  keying the overlay off it mounted the PMTiles sources while browsing AND removed them from the style
  MID-GESTURE when the first pan dropped followMe - that native style churn was the post-0.4.542
  "atrocious panning" regression (user device A/B: 542 smooth, wave janky). The hysteresis also stops
  stoplight churn. The scale bar hides only while `driveFollowing && speedOverlayArmed` (actually
  free-driving) - `!driveFollowing` alone had it hidden on the whole browse map.
  Never trust an 8-hex colour STRING for transparency. The FLEET DEFAULT is remote:
  `calibration.json` `defaultMapPalette` (v15) -> `Calibration.defaultMapPalette` -> the VM
  pushes it into `MapColors.remoteDefault` at init + after refresh; a user's explicit pick
  always wins. Changing everyone's default = edit the field, bump version, re-sign, commit
  (same channel as defaultVoiceId). Adding a whole NEW named set still needs an app release
  (palettes are compiled); make the apply fns data-driven if sets ever multiply.

- **The reviews RPC is DEAD, do not re-calibrate it (proven 2026-07-19):** the
  `listentitiesreviews` endpoint 404s for EVERYONE now - verified with a valid live feature id
  from both a raw client and a real logged-out Chromium session. Nothing calls
  `GoogleMapsDataSource.reviews()` anymore; ALL review content comes from the WebReviewsFetcher
  DOM scrape. If reviews ever break, debug the scrape (selectors, virtualized-list
  accumulation), not the RPC, and don't burn time trying to "fix" reviewsPb.
- **Review scrape accumulation replaces on LONGER TEXT (2026-07-19, issue #181):** a card is
  often harvested on the tick its More toggle was clicked, before Google's async re-render
  swaps in the full body - first-capture-wins turned that race into permanent "…" truncation.
  The accumulator keeps the longest text per review id, and expand() clicks the `.w8nwRe`
  class hook (language-independent) with the English label regex as fallback only. Keep both
  invariants if the scraper script is reworked.
- **Flat vegetation (2026-07-11):** fill-pattern CANNOT be cleared once a style layer ships
  with one (empty-literal unset no-ops on device) - `ensureLayers` hides `landcover_wetland` +
  `road_area_pattern` and adds flat twins `vela-wetland`/`vela-plaza` that applyLight/applyDark
  colour; the OSM poi tiers' filters exclude vegetation classes (park/garden/wood/tree/...) so
  forests read as flat green like Google, not icon confetti. Nav mute/steps/End are 54dp.
  The search bar hides while an expanded place sheet covers it (its sliver still took taps).

- **Photo DATES: every keyless in-page route is DEAD (probed exhaustively 2026-07-11).** The
  place page's APP_INITIALIZATION_STATE carries NO photo urls at walk time (census: one big
  string leaf, zero googleusercontent, zero "ago") - photos are id-referenced and urls come
  from lazy responses. The walk's `aisDates()`/`onDates` plumbing stays (inert, one-shot,
  lights up if Google ever re-embeds it), and `fetchPhotos` still merges any mined/RPC dates
  into the join. The ONE live route is recalibrating the hspqX RPC from a desktop capture
  (remote-fixable via calibration.json, see ROADMAP) - do NOT re-probe AIS. Review photos are
  a SEPARATE pipeline (author + date come from the review itself) and already show dates.
- **Flick = commit (2026-07-11):** a release faster than `FLING_COMMIT_DPS` (450 dp/s, shared
  const in PlaceSheet) advances AT LEAST one detent in the flick's direction on all three
  sheets (place/results/directions) - the pure coast projection needed the throw to cross half
  the gap and made short flicks feel dead, worst on the two-detent chooser. Hard throws still
  cross two detents via the projection.
- **Map palette matched to the GOOGLE APP screenshots (2026-07-11):** DARK vegetation is TEAL
  (#1a4a4d park/grass, #17434a wood, #194247 wetland) - the app's dark green, clearly lighter
  than the #242f3e land; LIGHT roads are FILLED blue-grey (#cbd9e3 minor, #c3d3e0 secondary,
  #bfd0de trunk/primary, casing #bccbd8) - the APP fills roads solid where the web uses
  white-with-a-grey-frame; light vegetation #d4edd5/#c8e6cb (app mint), land #f2f1ee, water
  #90daee. The map-style Settings row is REMOVED (single style; plumbing kept). Nav-card trip
  time is a FitText (shrinks to fit, floor 55%, never wraps/ellipsises).

- **Sheet flick velocity is measured on INTEGRATED deltas (2026-07-11):** the manual
  VelocityTrackers (place handle, results handle, the drag-anywhere directions panel) fed
  change.position, which is local to a node that MOVES as the sheet resizes - measured
  velocity ~0, flicks read as slow drags and never committed. They now feed a running sum of
  the drag deltas. `FLING_COMMIT_DPS` dropped 450 -> 260. The nested-scroll body paths were
  never affected (Compose computes those velocities properly), which is why the place sheet
  body always felt right.
- **DARK palette is PIXEL-SAMPLED from Google Maps on the attached Pixel 9 (2026-07-11,
  definitive - supersedes the eyedrop):** land #162640, other-landuse #1c2638, water #000d2a
  (DARKER than land, the inverted relationship matters), vegetation #0d3847 (teal), buildings
  #1c3b69 w/ outline #2e3d6d (Google's own second shade), minor roads #3d5a77,
  arterials/trunk/motorway #476789, casings = land, service/alley tier #2a4056 (Google
  draws alleys DARKER than streets - second P9 side-by-side 2026-07-11). Both former deltas are APPLIED (user 2026-07-11): `vela-trails` (LineLayer twin,
  class=path subclass path/cycleway/bridleway ONLY - footway/steps/pedestrian stay hidden,
  that was the June "weird walking tracks" clutter; inserted BELOW road_minor, minZoom 14)
  draws the trail network green (dark #167055 sampled); `vela-pitch` (landuse
  pitch/playground/track/stadium, above park) tints sports fields (dark #0d4956 sampled)
  - AND Liberty's own `landuse_pitch`/`landuse_track` layers (they sit ABOVE the twin) are
  coloured directly + exempted from the landuse-neutralise loops, else the tint never showed
  (found at a park with ball courts).
  Trail light = #7fcdb0 (P9-SAMPLED); pitch light = #a9eac2 (P9-SAMPLED at Toomey Field,
  no estimates left); campuses (landuse_school) = #f0eded warm grey (sampled at UC Davis,
  light only - dark keeps the neutralised land).
- **LIGHT palette is PIXEL-SAMPLED from the Google app on the P9 (2026-07-11, definitive,
  supersedes every earlier light set):** land #f8f7f7 (the app is cooler than the web's
  #f6f6f6 and the user's kept #f2f1ee - verbatim wins per user "all of it"), roads are ONE
  blue-grey fill #aab9c9 for streets AND arterials with NO casings (casings = land),
  driveways/service #9bacbc, motorway #8aa4c0, buildings #e8e9ed w/ outline #d6d9e6
  (extrusion = fill, light killed), vegetation #d3f8e1 (park/grass/wood/wetland all one
  mint), water #90daee (unchanged), plaza/parking surface #dbe0e8, trails #7fcdb0,
  COMMERCIAL/RETAIL blocks cream #fdf9ef via the `vela-commercial` twin (Liberty ships no
  layer for those classes; dark paints the twin #1c2638 = the other-landuse navy so dark
  is unchanged).
- **Glyph ink rule (2026-07-11): leading/functional GLYPHS wear the SOFT ink, text keeps
  the strong ink.** Solid Material icons read heavier than text at the same colour, and
  several sites were outright BLACK (an untinted Icon on a non-Surface container falls
  back to LocalContentColor black - the search page is a plain Box). Fixed sites: search
  bar gear (now onSurfaceVariant, matches the mic), map category chips
  (leadingIconContentColor onSurfaceVariant), the lists-bookmark ribbon circle
  (onSurfaceVariant both modes), ShortcutRow unset Home/Work (onSurfaceVariant, was
  SheetPalette.dim and mismatched the recents pin), the chooser Steps glyph + the
  search-along-route chip icons (SheetPalette dim beside ink labels). Give any NEW
  glyph-next-to-text the same treatment. **Bike routes: DEDICATED bike paths (OSM highway=cycleway,
  OMT subclass=cycleway) now draw in Google's teal #007b8b (light) / #1f8f9c (dark) via the
  `vela-bikeroutes` LineLayer, split OUT of `vela-trails` (which keeps foot subclass path/bridleway
  green) - 2026-07-11.** ON-STREET painted lanes (`cycleway=lane`/`cycleway:left/right` tagged on a
  road way) are NOT in the keyless OMT tile schema, so they still aren't drawn; that needs an
  Overpass layer (sibling of `OverpassTrafficSignals`) - see ROADMAP.
- **Ambient POI DOT TIER (2026-07-11):** `vela-ambient-dots`, a CircleLayer UNDER the
  ambient icon layer on the same source - every ambient place draws a small category-
  coloured circle (`dotColor` prop from PoiIcons.colorFor; radius 2.6-4.2 by prominence,
  ring = land colour per theme). Icons still collide; the losers now stay visible as dots
  and upgrade to icons as slots free up while zooming - Google's tiering. Circles skip the
  collision engine (cheap on the 5a/4a class GPUs); taps work through the same
  AMBIENT_INDEX_PROP rect query. Don't gate the dots on zoom - the ambient FETCH gate
  (z>=14) already bounds them. **The icon layer's `sort` (collision priority) is
  PROMINENCE-based, never the list index (2026-07-14):** the streamed pool RE-RANKS as terms
  land, so an index-based key changed every place's priority on each partial upload and the
  whole layer's placement reshuffled (the cold-load "icons consolidate and pop into each
  other"). `(10 - prominence) * 1000 + i` holds priorities still across uploads; the streamed
  partial paints also ESCALATE their batch (10 places first, 25 once >=60 painted,
  GoogleMapsDataSource) - each partial re-runs whole-layer placement, and halving the passes
  is most of the dense-area cold-load frame recovery. **Ambient LABELS are tiered by
  zoom x prominence (2026-07-14, copies Google):** textField is a step expression - <z15.5
  only prominence>=6.0 named, z15.5+ >=5.0, z16.5+ >=3.0, z17.5+ all (thresholds map through
  ambientProminence: 6.0 ~ 400+ reviews, 3.0 ~ 20+). An EMPTY textField skips that symbol's
  label placement entirely (textOpacity 0 would still place + collide invisibly), so this is
  also a placement-cost win. NOTE our MapLibre zoom reads ~1 lower than Google's for the same
  view extent (512px tiles) - A/B against gmaps by matching the VISIBLE AREA, not the z number.
  **SLIM-FLAVOR HEAL (2026-07-14, GoogleMapsDataSource.nearbyPlaces):** Google's first ~3 s of
  a fresh session serve a stripped per-place block (rating yes, reviewCount NO; same query+pb
  is rich seconds later - live-bisected on device). The cold-start fan-out lands entirely in
  that window, so the pool parsed with reviewCount=null and prominence ranking / dot sizing /
  label tiers all silently ran on zeros (and AmbientDiskCache persisted the zeroed pool).
  nearbyPlaces detects the flavor (>=3 rated, majority of rated missing counts) and refetches
  the fan-out once ~1.2 s later; healed places are prepended so distinctBy keeps the rich
  copy. Don't "fix" a flat-looking ambient layer by touching the expressions before checking
  whether the pool's counts are null. 3D extrusions = the flat colour at
  opacity 1f (the 0.9f translucency was the "3d buildings render slightly different" wonk)
  AND the style light at intensity 0 + fillExtrusionVerticalGradient(false) - MapLibre's
  default light (0.5) brightens extrusion tops ~40% at z16+ (#1c3b69 rendered #2e5590; the
  side-by-side P9 sample proved Google keeps buildings one colour at every zoom, 2026-07-11).
  Sampling recipe: screencap Google Maps on the Pixel 9 over the target area, Counter the
  band, probe specifics. **Flick velocity, final form:** all manual trackers integrate
  deltas AND take max(tracked, plain travel/time average) at release - a flick can never
  measure ~zero; FLING_COMMIT_DPS = 180. **The whole gesture lives in ONE helper now
  (`sheetDragGestures` in PlaceSheet.kt, 2026-07-11)** used by every hand-driven drag
  surface: place handle, minimized place body, directions panel, results handle (MapScreen
  imports it) - the velocity subtleties are too easy to fork-and-drift as copies.
- **The MINIMIZED place-card body is its own drag surface (2026-07-11):** minimized, the
  skeleton fits inside the floor height, so the body's verticalScroll has NO range - and an
  unscrollable scrollable never engages a drag, so nothing reached dismissConn: a flick on
  the minimized card read as dead while the same flick on the handle worked (device-proven
  both ways). A `pointerInput(minimizedState, singleDetent)` on the body Column runs
  `sheetDragGestures` ONLY while minimized (keyed remount hands drags back to the
  nested-scroll path when the full body shows); tap-to-restore still wins bare taps (a drag
  claims the pointer only past slop). Same class of hole the directions panel had ("finger
  basically right on the pull bar") - if a sheet region ever feels drag-dead, check whether
  its scrollable has zero range there.
- **(older eyedrop note)** **Map palette is USER-EYEDROPPED from the Google app (2026-07-11, supersedes my web/screen
  estimates):** DARK land #111c31, buildings #172b56 (outline #243970), roads #304864 (trunk
  #3d5878, casings = land), vegetation #0d2b38. LIGHT vegetation #caf8dc, buildings #e2e3e9,
  roads #b0c1d4 (secondary #aabdd0, trunk #a4b8cd, casings #a2b4c9); light land stays #f2f1ee
  (user prefers it over Google's #f6f6f6). Their eyedrop had macOS colour-shift on - expect a
  fine-tune pass.
- **Basemap labels are ROBOTO via self-hosted glyphs (built 2026-07-11, device-verified;
  dark-launched pending infra).** OpenFreeMap's glyph server is Noto-only (every Roboto stack
  404s), so Vela hosts its own set on the repo's GitHub Pages at `/Vela/fonts`:
  `scripts/build-map-fonts.sh` composites Roboto OVER OpenFreeMap's live Noto PER GLYPH
  (`scripts/composite_glyphs.py`, pure-python protobuf; Roboto wins its 896
  Latin/Cyrillic/Greek glyphs per stack, Noto keeps every other script - Shinjuku CJK
  device-verified intact), and the folders KEEP the "Noto Sans Regular/Bold/Italic" names so
  the ONLY style change is the `glyphs` URL (zero layer edits; the runtime textFont sites
  stay untouched; the inner PBF name field is decorative - OFM's own files carry a 23-font
  composite name). `ui/map/MapFonts` (init in VelaApp) fetches the LIVE Liberty JSON at
  launch - tile paths keep auto-following OFM's snapshot rotation, the property the old
  bundled asset lost - patches `glyphs`, caches to `filesDir/style/liberty-roboto.json`,
  and MapScreen swaps it in via `MapFonts.effective` (VelaMapView reads `file://` styles
  itself and falls back to the plain URL on a bad file). GUARDS, each device-proven: the
  font host is PROBED (range 0-255) and an unreachable host EVICTS the cache - a style
  whose glyph URLs fail renders NO labels, and the evicted fallback is byte-identical to
  the pre-font map (RMS 0.0 vs a Noto reference shot); a style-fetch failure keeps the
  last-good cache max 7 days (snapshot-rot guard), then the live URL wins. Offline REGION
  DEFINITIONS keep the plain Liberty URL on purpose (a definition outlives file paths, and
  its download caches Noto glyphs as the offline floor; the patched style's offline labels
  ride the ambient cache warmed by browsing). Local test loop: `python3 -m http.server` on
  the glyph dir + `adb reverse tcp:8099 tcp:8099` + `-PmapFontsUrl=http://127.0.0.1:8099`.
  NB `InputStream.readNBytes` is API 33+ (minSdk 26) - the probe reads manually. The
  ANDROID AUTO snapshotter resolves the same style (CarMapRenderer reads the patched
  file + `withStyleJson`; a plain `.withStyle(LIBERTY.uri)` kept the car on Noto).
  **ROLLOUT GATE (until all three land, every install just stays on Noto):** (1) publish
  the glyph zip: `gh release create map-fonts <zip> --prerelease` (staged at
  `build/map-fonts.zip`, or rebuild with the script - and it joins the DO-NOT-DELETE infra
  releases); (2) merge so `fdroid-repo.yml` carries the unpack-to-Pages step; (3) an
  fdroid-repo.yml run deploys the site. Then MapFonts' probe starts passing and Roboto
  lights up on next app launch, no app release needed.
- **Two-finger tilt: shove detector widened** (maxShoveAngle 55, pixelDeltaThreshold 8) - the
  stock 20-degree parallel requirement made tilt nearly impossible. **Photo viewer:**
  double-tap zooms 2.5x at the tap point / back out (a tap-detector pointerInput layered
  before the custom pinch/dismiss loop, which never consumes bare taps).
- **"Also at this location" is ALIVE (`placesHere`/`othersAt`)** - it fills only when the
  selected place resolves alongside OTHER listings at the same address (strip malls, tapping
  an address). Rarely seeing it = data-dependent, not removed. "People also search for"
  (`similarPlaces`) is the different, related-places row.

## Working on the scraper

- The `pb` request *grammar* (`PbBuilder`) and `PolylineCodec` are correct and
  stable. The **field numbers, response array indices, and session regexes are
  NOT** - they're marked `CALIBRATE:` and must be pinned from a live capture of
  `maps.google.com` (devtools/mitmproxy). Never trust a remembered `pb` layout.
- Turn the real source on with `VelaConfig.USE_GOOGLE_SOURCE = true` after
  calibrating. Parsers throw `CalibrationNeededException` (routine, non-fatal)
  when shapes drift; the UI surfaces it as a notice.
- **Never embed a static Google API key.** Per-user `GoogleSession` bootstrap
  only - that's what keeps the NewPipe legal footing.
- **Remote calibration (`calibration.json` at the repo root).** The `pb`/proto
  templates and endpoint URLs (search, directions, reviews, **photos** - 
  `photosEndpoint`/`photosProto` for the `hspqX` gallery RPC) are remotely
  updatable: `CalibrationStore` (in `:core`,
  `config/`) fetches `calibration.json` from the repo's raw URL at launch and
  adopts it when its `version` is higher than the bundled `Calibration.DEFAULT`,
  provided every endpoint host is on the allowlist (`www.google.com`/`google.com`).
  The bundle also carries the **language-keyword tables (v16, 2026-07-13)**: `transitCategoryWords`
  (the transit-category gate's regex terms - joined into one case-insensitive alternation, adopted
  by `MapViewModel.adoptKeywordTables` at init + after refresh, compiled regex as fallback) and
  `statusClosedWords`/`statusOpenWords` (per-language maps that REPLACE SearchParser's compiled
  open/closed tables when present - absent in the shipped json on purpose, the field support is
  the hot-fix path). These are the one part of the localized scrape that reads localized TEXT to
  decide something, so a wrong or missing word in a language nobody on the project speaks is a
  config edit + version bump + re-sign, not an app release (issue #71 was exactly this class of
  bug). The bundle also carries **`defaultVoiceId`** (String - the Piper voice a fresh install
  downloads + activates), **`defaultVoiceSpeaker`** (int - only tunes libritts_r's 904
  variants) and **`defaultVoiceSpeed`** (float - spoken-directions speed), so a favourite
  voice/speaker/pace can be pushed as everyone's default with a version bump + re-sign, no
  app release (a user's own `voice_model`/`voice_speaker`/`voice_speed` pick still wins).
  Shipped defaults (calibration **v13**): voice **HFC Female** (`en_US-hfc_female-medium`),
  speaker 14 (libritts only), speed **0.8×** (the user's preferred cadence; briefly 0.72 on 2026-07-06,
  reverted 2026-07-07) - matched in the compiled `Calibration.DEFAULT`
  + `VelaPiper.DEFAULT_VOICE_ID`. NB the neural voice lengthens pauses at periods by
  **splitting the utterance on sentence boundaries and splicing silence in-app**
  (`PiperSynth.splitSentences`/`joinWithGaps`) - sherpa-onnx's `silenceScale` config is
  a measured no-op on the Piper/VITS path, don't reach for it. **Every fragment gets terminal
  punctuation before synthesis (`PiperSynth`, 2026-07-07):** a bare-ending fragment ("turn left") gives
  the model no final prosody contour, so it trailed off and swallowed the last consonant - the real-drive
  "lef" instead of "left". A `;` is appended to any fragment ending in a letter/digit (the same
  semicolon-contour finding the user A/B'd on "You have arrived;"); punctuation is language-neutral, so
  it's safe for every Piper voice. Spoken text also runs through
  `SpeechText.spokenNumbers` in `EnNavStrings.expandForSpeech` - 3-digit **street ordinals** ("120th" →
  "one twenty eighth", **space not hyphen** - the hyphenated compound got a reduced/flapped "-ty" from
  the neural voice, "152nd" came out sounding like "one fifth second" in testing) are
  pre-expanded so the neural G2P doesn't mangle them into "one, hundred
  and 28th" (only 100–999; 1–2 digit + 4-digit+ are left for espeak). And `NavEngine` **does not
  announce the DEPART maneuver** - `NavSession.start` speaks it once ("Starting navigation. Head
  east on F St"); the engine skips it (it's at distance ≈ 0) and advances silently, else the opener
  gets clipped by a re-announced "head out".
  **Multiple downloadable voices (voice browser, 2026-07-03).** `VelaPiper` is no longer one hardcoded
  model - it's one engine (`ENGINE_ID = "vela.piper"`) that holds ANY of many Piper voices, each in its
  own `filesDir/piper/<id>/` dir (`<id>.onnx` + `tokens.txt` + `espeak-ng-data/`, the sherpa
  `vits-piper-<id>` archive layout). The **installed set is derived from the filesystem** (`installedVoiceIds`,
  keeps only complete dirs → a partial download self-heals), the pick persists in **`voice_model`**, and
  **speaker choice is per-voice** (`voice_speaker_<id>`; the legacy global `voice_speaker` is migrated onto
  libritts_r). The browsable catalog is `PiperCatalog` in `:core` (pure data, unit-tested, ~40 curated
  voices across the languages Piper covers (en_US/en_GB, the 10 original i18n languages, Mandarin; ja/he have NO Piper voice and ride the system-TTS fallback); URL = `…/tts-models/vits-piper-<id>.tar.bz2`). `PiperSynth.ensureLoaded` reloads when
  the selected voice changes; `PiperSynth.reloadVoice()` is the SINGLE switch trigger - it bumps the
  generation counter (aborting any in-flight utterance) then tears down + rebuilds on the same serial
  worker, so `tts` is never freed mid-`generate()`. `MapViewModel.migrateFlatLayoutIfNeeded` (first thing
  in `init`) relocates the old flat single-voice install in place (rename, copy-fallback, verify-gated,
  re-runnable) - never re-downloads. **Any large download (voice model, routing graph, building overlay)
  MUST NOT use the shared OkHttp client** - its `callTimeout(12s)` (scrape-bounding) aborts the body read
  mid-stream, `runCatching` eats it, and the asset SILENTLY never installs (this is exactly what hid the
  197 MB overlay for a whole debug cycle - no crash, no log, just no footprints). `KokoroInstaller`,
  `RoutingGraphStore`, `OverlayTileStore` **and `VoiceInstaller`** (the TTS-engine APK download - added
  2026-07-06 audit; a >12 s APK fetch silently fell back to the F-Droid web page) each derive a
  `downloadHttp` with `callTimeout(0)` + `readTimeout(60s)` for the body; only the tiny manifest/version
  fetch stays on the shared short-timeout client. `OverlayTileStore.download` is also serialized behind a
  `Mutex` (+ a first-line "already installed" re-check) so two callers for the same region can't interleave
  writes into the one `.tmp` (whose 7-byte magic check could then pass on a corrupt archive).
  Settings → Voice → **Voice library** is the browser; the
  multi-speaker variant picker (Advanced) only shows when the SELECTED catalog voice has >1 speaker.
  **To ship a pb/endpoint fix WITHOUT an app release:** edit the drifted field in
  `calibration.json`, **bump `version`**, **re-sign** (`./scripts/sign-calibration.sh`),
  commit `calibration.json` + `calibration.json.sig` to `main` - users pick it up on
  their next launch (raw.githubusercontent caches ~5 min). Keep the compiled
  `Calibration.DEFAULT`'s field VALUES (paths, endpoints, voice defaults) in sync with
  `calibration.json` when you cut a release - but `DEFAULT.version` intentionally STAYS `1` (the
  remote bundle's higher `version` must always win the adopt-if-newer check; the shipped
  `calibration.json` is at v13, `DEFAULT.version` at 1 - that gap is by design, not drift). **Phase 2 (done): the search parser's positional
  field-index paths are remote too** - the `paths` object in `calibration.json`
  (`name`, `address`, `rating`, `photos`, `featureId`, … as `[i,j,…]` arrays,
  relative to a result entry whose place node is `[1]`; `results`/`single` are
  root-relative). So a "Google moved field X to a new index" fix is also just an
  edit + version bump. **All three result-shape gates now follow `paths.name`** - `singleResultEntry`,
  `atThisPlaceEntries` and `findResultsArray` wrap the candidate as `[null, node]` and validate through
  `pathOf(paths,"name")` instead of a hard-coded `at(11)`, so a `paths.name` recalibration reaches the
  single-result / address-snap / fallback paths too (they used to silently keep dropping results at the
  old index). And the WebView details/popular-times path (`PopularTimesParser.parse`) threads the LIVE
  `cal.paths` through `SearchParser.parse`/`parsePopularTimes` rather than pinning `DEFAULT_PATHS` (audit 2026-07-06).
- **Fleet tuning dials (2026-07-18): `tuning` in `calibration.json`** - a flat name->number map
  read through `Calibration.tune(key, compiledDefault)`; a missing key means the compiled
  default and a non-numeric value is skipped, so old/new bundles and apps never break each
  other. Adding a dial is a config edit, not a schema change. Current dials: `browseZoom` /
  `browseZoomWide` / `browseZoomFocus` (the browse fly-to zooms, 15.5/14.5/16.5),
  `overlayCoverFrac` (the MS building-overlay hide threshold, 0.18), `ambientFanoutPermits`
  (parallel scrape parses, 4; read at construction so it applies on the next process start),
  `ambientCapMin`/`ambientCapMax` (the zoom-tiered on-screen POI cap, 45/140). View-layer
  consumers read `CalibrationStore.latest` (a static of the last verified bundle) since
  composables can't inject the store. Same edit+bump+re-sign flow as everything else.
- **Signed channel (mandatory).** The bundle is **ECDSA-P256/SHA-256 signed**
  (`calibration.json.sig`, detached, base64) and the app verifies it against the
  **public key pinned in `CalibrationStore.PINNED_PUBLIC_KEY`** before adopting - 
  so a repo/CDN compromise can't push config *or code* to devices. The private key
  lives at `~/.vela-signing/vela-calibration.key` (**never commit it**; the public
  half is safe to embed). `scripts/sign-calibration.sh` signs + self-verifies;
  `BundleSignature.verify` (`:core`) is the unit-tested verifier. A bundle that
  fails verification is ignored (app keeps the last-good config). An unsigned/older
  cached copy falls back to the compiled `DEFAULT` for one launch.
- **Notices.** `calibration.json` carries a `notices` array (`id`/`level`/`title`/
  `body`/`url`) shown as dismissable cards on the bare map; **level "urgent" (2026-07-10)
  renders as a MODAL VelaDialog instead** (OK dismisses; a `url` adds a Learn-more button)  - 
  for pushed announcements that must be seen. Cards for routine notes, urgent sparingly. (`MapViewModel.refreshNotices`,
  dismissed ids in `vela_notices` prefs) - push "search is down, fix coming" with no
  app update. Rides the same signed channel.
- **Phase 3 (done): remote parse *logic*** via `transformsJs` - a signed JS bundle
  run in a **Rhino sandbox** (`JsSandbox`, interpreted/`optimizationLevel=-1` for ART,
  `initSafeStandardObjects` so it can't reach Java/IO; a private `ContextFactory` arms Rhino's
  instruction observer as a **2 s wall-clock kill switch** - a runaway `while(true)` in a pushed
  `transforms.js` throws an `Error` (which JS can't `catch`) → the `runCatching` becomes the
  compiled-Kotlin fallback, so it can't hang search or, via `synchronized(this)`, wedge every later
  transform (audit 2026-07-06, unit-tested); `org.mozilla:rhino-runtime`,
  R8-keep in `core/consumer-rules.pro`). `JsTransforms` exposes two search hooks - 
  `parseSearch(rawResponse)` (full re-parse of a reshaped response) and
  `transformPlaces(placesJson)` (post-process) - over the flat `PlaceJson` contract;
  **compiled Kotlin is always the fallback** (no script / missing fn / any error →
  unchanged). So a *response-shape* change can be hot-fixed too, not just a moved
  field. Wired in `GoogleMapsDataSource.search`. Verified on-device (a pushed
  `transformPlaces` marked the first result; cleared after).

## Degoogled constraints (hard rules)

- Location: AOSP `LocationManager` only - never `FusedLocationProviderClient`. **Fix discipline
  (2026-07-04 audit, don't regress):** NETWORK (BeaconDB) fixes are DROPPED during nav and used in
  browse only when GPS has been quiet ≥12 s (`NETWORK_FIX_QUIET_MS`, OsmAnd's `useOnlyGPS` pattern) - 
  they're 100-1000 m off and teleported the dot/reroutes; inter-fix `dt` comes from
  `loc.elapsedRealtimeNanos` (monotonic - `loc.time` mixes GNSS UTC with the network system clock and
  a negative dt bypassed the outlier gate); fixes with accuracy >50 m never feed `NavSession`; the
  `minDistanceM=0f` registration MUST stay 0 (a distance filter starves fixes at a standstill - the
  frozen-speedo/creeping-puck bug). Measured speeds pass a SYMMETRIC accel-bounded gate against the
  last ACCEPTED value (`gateMeasuredSpeed`, 2-fix persistence escape, shared with replay) - one-sided
  spike filters self-latch (a down-glitch to 0 then rejects every real speed as an up-spike forever).
- **Avoid tolls / avoid highways (2026-07-11):** two sticky FilterChips in the route
  chooser (DRIVE only; prefs `avoid_tolls`/`avoid_highways`, seeded in routeToSelected like
  the sticky mode). **2026-08-08 (Reddit reports "just sat there" / "still routed through the
  motorway"):** the on-device avoid attempt is BOUNDED (`AVOID_ONDEVICE_TIMEOUT_MS` 4 s, an
  UNSTRUCTURED async on purpose - a structured child would pin coroutineScope open until the
  non-cancellable native compute ends and defeat the timeout; the orphan finishes and is
  discarded) because the obf engine can spend many seconds on a long route; and routes the
  online chain produced while a toggle was on carry `Route.avoidNotHonored` (set in both the
  single-dest and multi-stop paths, never on the on-device result) - DirectionsPanel shows
  `place_avoid_not_honored` under the chips when EVERY route carries it, so a toggled avoid is
  never silently ignored. PLUMBING: `MapDataSource.directions`/`nameRoute` + `RouteEngine.route`
  carry the flags end to end. The public FOSSGIS OSRM REJECTS `exclude=` (probed 2026-07-11:
  InvalidValue - its profiles lack excludable classes; routeOsrm bails on any 4xx instead
  of retrying, AND `OSRM_SUPPORTS_EXCLUDE=false` keeps the param OFF entirely - sending it
  400'd the whole request and lost the clean named-turn route while a chip was on, a worse
  route than just not honouring avoid online; flip the const on a self-hosted OSRM), so the AUTHORITATIVE avoid router is the ON-DEVICE graph: `GraphBuilder` bakes
  `car_avoid_toll`/`car_avoid_motorway` CH profiles (EV string grew `toll, road_class` - a
  BREAKING graph change; the engine try-loads the v2 EV string then the old one so existing
  graphs keep working, minus avoid) and `GraphHopperRouteEngine` mirrors the blocking
  weightings (Toll.ALL / RoadClass.MOTORWAY -> infinite weight; tolls wins when both toggles
  are on). directions() tries the on-device avoid route FIRST when a toggle is on; a graph
  without the profiles returns EMPTY (never silently routes through a toll) and the online
  chain falls back to a NORMAL route. **LIVE since 2026-07-11: all 135 regions are rebaked as the v2 generation**
  (`<id>-v2.zip` + `routing-manifest-v2.json` beside the v1 assets (v1 was deleted 2026-07-13 after the cutover; v2 is the only live generation) on the
  `routing-graphs` release - the workflow's `variant` input publishes parallel generations)
  and the app's `ROUTING_MANIFEST_URL` default points at the v2 manifest; rollback = revert
  that one build.gradle.kts line. Graphs installed before the cutover keep working (the
  engine try-loads the v2 EV string then legacy) but lack the avoid profiles until
  re-downloaded. Device-verified: Dover-Smyrna with Avoid tolls swung off the DE-1 toll road
  onto the free route, single on-device route, no live-traffic tag.
- Nav guidance discipline (2026-07-04 audit): prompt/turn-now distances SCALE WITH SPEED in
  `NavEngine` (max(fixed, v×T), T=35/10 s since 2026-07-17; `spoken` stores band SLOTS not metres), one prompt per update speaking
  the TRUE distance, REPEATS TRIMMED (2026-07-17: a step's non-first prompts speak
  `NavStrings.repeatShort` - EN drops the " toward ..." sign tail, other languages default to
  full until they override - and a MERGE skips the far band entirely; a long on-ramp narrated
  the same road 3-4 times in declining counts, real-drive report), silent catch-up past maneuvers >75 m behind, proximity arrival (crow ≤40 m) +
  no rerouting within 150 m of the destination or while stationary (EXCEPT a FAR deviation:
  `FAR_OFF_M` 90 m counts at ANY speed since 2026-07-14 - parking-lot creep sits under the 2 m/s
  moving floor forever and the reroute/redrawn line never came; since 2026-07-15 a moving fix
  past FAR_OFF_M also counts DOUBLE, and `OFF_ROUTE_M` is 40 m / `OFF_ROUTE_HITS` 3 (were 45/4) -
  the user's wrong turns rerouted too slowly, and the corridor width plus the debounce were the
  lag; don't loosen these back without a false-reroute report. The off-route corridor + far distance
  are ACCURACY-SCALED and mode-relative since 2026-07-15: `NavEngine.update` takes `offRouteM`/`farOffM`
  params (defaulting to the flat 40/90 so tests + `NavReplay` are unchanged), and `NavSession` computes
  them per fix via the pure `NavEngine.offRouteCorridor(mode, accuracyM)` / `farOffDistance(mode, off)`.
  The corridor = `base + K*accuracy` clamped per mode (OsmAnd-style: tight on a clean fix, wide on a
  noisy one so urban-canyon multipath can't false-reroute), foot < bike < drive because the PATH is
  narrow. Driving self-tightens below the old flat 40 m when GPS is clean - which is the "40 is too
  high" the user hit - without inviting false reroutes when GPS degrades. `MapViewModel` feeds
  `loc.accuracy` (null → a typical-GPS default; the dead-reckoning path passes null). Don't reintroduce
  a fixed sub-30 m distance - it was rejected as extreme (2026-07-15), the whole point is it scales.
  HEADING TERM (2026-07-16): distance alone can't catch a wrong turn onto a road that runs INSIDE the
  corridor of the planned one - the projection kept snapping the driver onto the OLD route, guidance
  carried on with its turns, no reroute, no redrawn line (the "not even rerouting" report). A moving
  fix coursing >HEADING_OFF_DEG (60) against the route's local bearing counts as an off-route hit even
  inside the corridor (`bearingDeg` rides onLocation -> update; null in replays/tests = unchanged), and
  a heading-diverged fix never counts toward onRouteStreak (else back-on-course would discard the
  legit wrong-way reroute mid-fetch). The 3-hit debounce absorbs turn transients/lane changes),
  off-route measured on the
  windowed/anchored projection (never whole-polyline min), reroutes are single-flight + cooldown +
  latch-clear-on-failure (a failed fetch must NOT kill rerouting - the event is edge-triggered), and
  since 2026-07-21 the fetch has a HARD 20 s deadline (REROUTE_FETCH_TIMEOUT_MS): the retry
  ladders inside directions() could hold the single-flight latch for a minute on a flaky cell
  link, silently dropping every new RerouteNeeded (a real-drive hang); past the deadline it
  fails into the same retry-while-deviated path so the next fix fires a fresh request. And
  since 2026-08-04 the reroute fetch is URGENT (`directions(urgent = true)`, issues #185/#236):
  single-shot OSRM + Google (no 3x ladders), no divergence snap - the full planning ladder
  regularly outlived the deadline on a weak link, so the timeout cancelled fetches that were
  about to succeed (the reporter's "context canceled then 200 OK" logcat) and the driver sat
  unrerouted through repeated 20 s attempts. A lean route lands in seconds; maybeRecheck's
  stepsUpgrade/trafficUpgrade heal restores quality minutes later. Planning fetches keep the
  full ladder + snap, and
  ETA sums the remaining STEP durations × traffic ratio (never remaining/avg-speed), and since
  2026-07-14 that ratio is LIVE-CALIBRATED: the ~2-min recheck's candidate, when it follows the
  CURRENT course (`RouteGeometry.divergent` under `SAME_COURSE_M` = 250 m), resets `etaScale`
  (NavSession, multiplicative, clamped 0.5-2.5, applied at the publish site only - the engine's
  own value stays pristine; reset to 1.0 on every route swap) so the shown arrival time follows
  evolving traffic instead of the ratio frozen at the last route fetch. **TUNNEL DEAD RECKONING
  (2026-07-14, `MapViewModel.tunnelDeadReckonLoop`):** the engine only advances on fixes, so a
  GPS outage froze the whole stack; when the guidance feed goes quiet >3.5 s while navigating,
  on-route, not replaying and not from a standstill, the VM synthesizes 1 Hz fixes ALONG the
  route at the last speed (decay tau 60 s, floor 1.5 m/s, cap 3 km) through the NORMAL
  `navSession.onLocation` path - puck/banner/voice keep working, `navStarved` keeps the
  "Searching for GPS" chip up for honesty, the first real fix re-anchors (route-plausible
  synthetics pass the outlier gate). Never feeds `tripStore.record` (no fake points in trips).
  Nav zoom range is 18.0→15.5 (2026-07-14, was 17.3→15.0). **DEMO DRIVES RAN THE PUCK CLOCKS AT 3x (issue #251, fixed 2026-08-10 - the
  dominant cause of the "record needle" swim).** `startDemoDrive` feeds
  `locationProvider.replay(fixes, speedup = 1f)` - REAL-TIME fixes - but it also sets
  `replaying`, and MapScreen keyed `replaySpeedup` off that flag alone, so a demo drive
  inherited the recorded-trip 3x clock scaling. The puck then dead-reckoned 3x too far between
  fixes, the monotonic clamp stalled it until the next fix caught up, and its route bearing
  jumped on every surge. Instrumented on-device (temporary `VelaBrg` log, 60 Hz):
  progress stalled on **54.7%** of frames with 2.4 m lurches, chord-bearing wiggle **1.74 deg**,
  camera yaw wiggle **0.83 deg** - which the 55 deg tilt smears into 15-50 px of horizontal swim
  across the TOP of the screen while the puck sits rock steady (screen-space proof: top-band
  motion 6x the bottom band = rotation, not translation). After gating the scaling on
  `!demoDriving`: 0% stalled, chord wiggle **0.53**, camera wiggle **0.29** deg, on-screen top-band
  motion halved. The gate is `state.replaying && !state.demoDriving` - a genuine trip REPLAY still
  emits fixes at 3x and MUST keep the scaling. **Nav-camera eases also use a CAPPED time
  step (`dtEase` <= 65 ms, same issue, video-diagnosed):** a main-thread hitch (the
  400 m road-label pass lands near junctions) used to deliver one frame whose exponential eases
  jumped 45-70% of their error at once - the map lurched sideways under a rock-steady puck.
  Integration (Kalman/reckoning) keeps real dtT; only the cosmetic eases (progress, bearing,
  camera pos/brg/zoom/tilt/padding) use dtEase, spreading a hitch's catch-up over ~6 frames.
  At smooth 60 fps the math is unchanged (16 ms << cap). A pinch during nav sets a zoom
  override WITHOUT detaching the follow camera (deliberate), which meant no Re-center path back
  to auto-zoom existed (issue #238) - since 2026-08-04 VelaMapView reports the override up
  (onNavZoomOverride) so MapScreen shows the nav Re-center FAB for it, and the button bumps
  navRecenterTick which clears navUserZoom/navUserTilt back to auto; GTFS stop icons hide during nav
  (declutter effect + the VM skips the fetch). The route line's
  driven/ahead cut is a GEOMETRY split (`ROUTE_AHEAD_LAYER` suffix over a traversed-grey full line) - 
  MapLibre bakes line-gradients into a 256-texel texture, so a gradient stop can never render a crisp
  cut and there is no `line-trim-offset` in MapLibre; don't "simplify" it back to a gradient.
- Nav drive-report fixes (2026-07-05): (1) **Route line z-order** - the route line inserts BELOW the first
  symbol layer, but Liberty's first symbol is `road_one_way_arrow` (~idx 61) which sits UNDER the `bridge_*`
  layers (~63-82) → bridges painted over the route on bridges (it "vanished"). `VelaMapView.ensureLayers`
  anchors instead to the first symbol AFTER the last `bridge_*` layer (a real label), so the route draws above
  all road+bridge geometry, still below text. (2) **Exit consolidation** - OSRM splits one exit into ramp +
  fork/merge steps, each spoken separately ("Take exit 15"…"Keep right"…"Merge"). `RouteGeometry.consolidateExits`
  folds a ramp's immediately-following, <500 m-gapped FORK/MERGE run into the ramp maneuver (sums distances so
  they still tile the polyline; stops at any real turn / far gap) → one prompt. Unit-tested. **Cousin `rampReclass` (2026-07-21):** a SIGNLESS
  dead-straight "on ramp" (dual-carriageway rename transitions get tagged *_link in OSM, so OSRM
  calls them ramps) reclassifies to "new name" before typing/phrasing - silent CONTINUE, never
  "Take the ramp" on a road that just renames; narrow on purpose (straight/null modifier only,
  destinations present always keeps the ramp). **Sibling
  `RouteGeometry.foldRenames` (2026-07-06)** folds a pure-rename CONTINUE (OSRM `continue`/`new name` going
  straight, no genuine fork - "Olive Dr becomes Richards Blvd") into the PRECEDING maneuver so it's not its own
  banner card / step at all - NavEngine already SILENCED its voice, but it still showed a silly "Continue onto X"
  card where Google shows nothing (user report). Applied on BOTH routers (OSRM `parseOsrmRoute` + GraphHopper
  `toRoute`); a genuine-fork CONTINUE (`continueHasGenuineFork`, spoken) and STRAIGHT (a junction straight-through)
  are left alone. Unit-tested. (3) **Feet steps**
 - `formatDistance` (banner) + every `NavStrings.spokenDistance` table (voice) round feet Google-style: 50 ft at/above
  100 ft, 10 ft below. (4) **Voice K/C** - `EnNavStrings.expandForSpeech` rewrites `<XX>-<n>` (CA-99, SR-99) →
  "State Route n" so espeak's G2P doesn't mangle the bare 2-letter code's onset. **(4b) "take" → "tyke"
  (2026-07-11):** espeak's G2P is context-sensitive - on a full "take the ramp toward Woodland" it
  mis-voweled "take", but "take the ramp" alone was correct (user A/B). `expandForSpeech` now inserts a
  comma before " toward " (`", toward "`), which is a `SpeechText.speechFragments` boundary, so the model
  phonemizes "take the ramp" in isolation and reads the sign destination as its own beat (Google pauses
  there too). "toward" only appears on ramp/exit/highway-sign steps, so plain "onto" turns are untouched;
  unit-tested, EAR-VERIFIED by the user 2026-07-11. Related but NOT actionable: proper-noun prosody
  wobbles ("San Francisco" reads flat/off depending on the FOLLOWING words; appending an "h" happened
  to help one sentence, but the trigger context varies) - that's VITS prosody, not a text bug; no
  reliable text-level fix, don't chase per-word respellings. (6) **Continue/straight lane silence** - a CONTINUE/STRAIGHT speaks its lane preface ONLY for a GENUINE fork (an "off" lane whose OWN indication is an explicit `straight`/`slight*` arrow, e.g. "use the left 2 lanes to stay on I-80"); a plain turn bay at an intersection (off lane marked only `left`/`right`, OR **`none`** = OSRM's "no painted arrow" sentinel, which is NOT "goes straight") while you sail straight through is silenced (`Route.continueHasGenuineFork` gates `NavEngine`'s escape hatch; it matches only `straight`/`slight*` on an off lane - `none`/`through` are excluded) - Google stays silent there and the road-just-renames case had been over-speaking. (5) **Traffic-light landmarks
  ("pass the light, then turn") - BUILT (Settings → Navigation → "Traffic-light guidance", OFF by default,
  English-only):** `RouteGeometry.enrichWithLights` folds a "pass the light, then …" clause into a surface-street
  TURN when 1–2 signals fall on the approach (`NavStrings.passLights`); signals from `OverpassTrafficSignals.fetchAlong`
  (keyless Overpass). **Two audit-2026-07-06 refinements (unit-tested):** it EXCLUDES a signal AT the turn vertex
  itself (that's the light you turn at, not one you pass first - `distanceTo(turnPt) >= LIGHT_SNAP_M`), and it
  CLUSTERS matched signals within `LIGHT_CLUSTER_M` (30 m) before counting, because OSM maps one `traffic_signals`
  node per approach/carriageway at a junction - raw-node counting said "pass 2 lights" for one intersection. Still
  needs a real-drive calibration of the thresholds. The neural voice's occasional attack-clip at sentence starts is
  a model-level Piper limit, separate from the CA-99 fix.
- **Free-drive follow (2026-07-11, user request).** Browsing without a route, the camera now tracks the fix and the
  heading beam is smoothed the way nav is. Implemented as a SECOND per-frame ticker in `VelaMapView`
  (`LaunchedEffect(navMode, driveFollowing)`, sibling of the nav `LaunchedEffect(navMode, routePolyline)`): when
  `driveFollowing` it eases `browseBeam` toward `compassHeading ?: myBearing` (tau 0.15 s) and eases `browseCam`
  toward `myLocation` north-up (k = 1-exp(-dt/**0.22** s), loosened from 0.16 2026-07-13 so the camera keeps
  CHASING between the ~1 Hz fixes instead of coasting to each and stopping = a continuous glide, nearer the nav
  feel), driving the ME source (`setMeSource`) + `moveCamera` each frame, with an idle-skip when neither moved
  (a settled follow doesn't re-upload 60x/s). **NORTH-UP is ENFORCED, not assumed (2026-07-14):**
  `moveCamera(newLatLng)` moves only the target, so a leftover bearing/tilt (a previous nav's heading-up
  camera, an old manual rotate) survived into the follow and a drive tracked DOWN the screen -
  `browseAtt` now eases both back to 0 with the same k (zoom stays untouched, so a pinch level
  survives), and the nav-exit teardown also levels bearing/tilt (+ resets the sticky puck-low camera
  padding) for the not-following case. A manual rotate is a gesture, which drops follow - never fight it.
  **DRIVING mode = HEADING-UP like nav (2026-07-15, supersedes north-up FOR DRIVING):** the north-up
  ask was made from a car and what actually felt wrong was sideways puck motion. `browseDrive`
  ([smoothedSpeed, engagedFlag, courseTarget, lookaheadM]) latches driving on above 2.5 m/s
  (smoothed) with a known course; while engaged the ticker eases the LIVE camera bearing toward
  the GPS course (course target updates only >2 m/s - never trust a crawl), tilt toward nav's 55,
  and aims the camera at a point `speed*5` m (cap 250) AHEAD of the puck along course - the nav
  puck-low framing WITHOUT sticky padding (nothing to un-stick when follow drops; the puck itself
  still draws at `browseCam`). A red light HOLDS the attitude (engaged releases only when the
  follow ends via the effect reset). The beam prefers GPS course over compass while engaged (car
  bodies wreck magnetometers). North-up flat enforcement still runs for the NOT-engaged regime
  (walking/slow browse). Don't re-add north-up for driving without re-reading this.
  **The follow target DEAD-RECKONS between fixes (2026-07-14):** easing toward the raw ~1 Hz fix
  chased a target that jumps then sits - the per-second surge-and-stall jitter (user report). The
  ticker now projects the last fix forward along its own speed + course every frame (constant
  velocity, gated to >1.5 m/s with a known course, capped 2.5 s blind) and eases toward THAT, so
  the camera chases a target moving like the car - the nav glide, no route needed. The next fix
  re-anchors and the ease absorbs the correction. This CLOSES the "fuller dead-reckon is the next
  step" note above; tuning (the 2.5 s cap, the 1.5 m/s gate) still wants a real drive.
  **Drive-verified follow-ups (2026-07-14 evening):** (1) the DOT still jolted 1 Hz after the
  camera went smooth - applyData's recomposition paint used the RAW fix while the ticker drew the
  eased point, the exact bug the meBearing guard fixed for the ANGLE; `mePaint` (the eased point
  while following) is the position twin - any new me-source writer must respect the ticker's
  ownership of BOTH. (2) north-up is enforced against the LIVE camera bearing/tilt each frame,
  not a copy seeded at engage - the shadow copy went blind to any rotation arriving from outside
  the ticker and the map stayed rotated. **The PUCK draws at the EASED position (`browseCam`), not the raw
  fix (2026-07-13):** at the raw fix the dot teleported forward on the map each fix while the camera eased to
  catch up (the visible hop); at the eased position it stays centred and glides with the map, the locked
  puck+camera the nav follow has. (A fuller constant-velocity dead-reckon between fixes is the next step if it
  still isn't smooth enough - needs a real drive to tune.) It OWNS the location
  source while running, so `applyData` must NOT repaint the raw compass over it - the call sites pass `meBearing`
  (= smoothed `browseBeam` when following, else `displayBearing`). The camera `when` block has a guard branch
  (`!navMode && driveFollowing && myLocation != null`) so a new fix's recomposition can't fire an `animateCamera`
  that fights the glide. Gate lives in `MapScreen` (`followMe`, default true; a `onUserPan` drops it, the locate FAB
  re-arms it; suppressed while search/place/directions/results own the camera). **A programmatic
  jump > 1 km from the fix ALSO drops it (2026-07-13):** a recents pick / search hit / pasted
  coordinate only SUSPENDED follow while the sheet owned the camera, so closing the sheet resumed
  it and glided the map all the way home (device report). A LaunchedEffect on `state.center`
  disarms follow when the new center lands far from `myLocation`; a nearby POI tap keeps it. Feel constants unverified on a real
  drive - revertible.
- Nav fixes (2026-07-05, round 2): (1) **Replay arrow** - the replay puck showed only the DOT, never the
  directional arrow. The arrow's visibility keys on the `displayBearing` passed to `applyData`
  (`VelaMapView` ~730), which prefers snap/compass/`myBearing`; recorded traces often carry no per-fix bearing,
  so with no route snap it went null and hid the arrow. Now falls back to the engaged puck's OWN route-derived
  heading (`navPuck.displayBearing`, seeded from the road segment by the motion ticker) while navigating.
  (2) **Replay GPS snap-back** - the puck kept jumping from the trace to the user's REAL GPS. `replayTrip`
  cancels+nulls `locationJob`, but `startLocation()` is guarded only by `locationJob != null`, so a permission
  callback / MapScreen effect re-started the live collector mid-replay and its real fixes overwrote
  `myLocation`+`center`. Fixed with two guards: `startLocation()` no-ops while `replaying`, and the live
  collector drops every fix while `replaying` (belt-and-suspenders). Replay's `finally` still resumes live GPS
  once `replaying=false`. (2b) **Replay teardown** (stop or natural end) - the blue line stayed drawn and the
  dot stuck at the trace's end point. The `navSession→state` observer keeps `activeRoute` once nav stops
  (`else it.activeRoute`), so the `finally` must explicitly null `activeRoute`/`routes`/`directionsOpen`/step
  preview; and it now snaps `myLocation`/`center` back to the user's real PRE-replay location (`resumeLoc`,
  captured in `replayTrip`) so the dot leaves the trace end - resumed live GPS refines it on the next fix.
  Gated on `ownedNav` (a replay riding an already-active nav leaves that route/location alone). (3) **U-turn / back-on-course** - a U-turn strays >45 m → `RerouteNeeded` → async
  directions fetch (~1-3 s); but the U-turn outlasts the fetch, and by the time it lands the driver has
  rejoined the ORIGINAL line and the engine cleared the `offRoute` latch - yet `reroute()` adopted the fresh
  route anyway, yanking a self-corrected driver onto a different path. Now `reroute()` captures `fromRoute` and,
  before adopting, discards the result if the driver is SOLIDLY back on it - `route === fromRoute &&
  nav.onRouteStreak >= BACK_ON_COURSE_HITS(2)` - Google's "you're back on course, carry on". **NOT bare
  `!offRoute`**: an adversarial review showed the offRoute latch clears on a SINGLE grazing fix (and `offDist`
  can match a parallel/overlapping leg), so one spurious graze would kill a legit missed-turn reroute. So
  `NavState.onRouteStreak` (consecutive on-corridor+moving fixes, computed in `NavEngine` beside `offRouteHits`,
  reset the instant off) gates it - a graze can't reach 2, a real rejoin does. Self-healing (a re-deviation
  re-fires the edge; no cooldown charged). Threshold tunable from a real-drive U-turn capture. (4) **Traffic incidents** - re-investigated + DEFERRED
  (user, 2026-07-05): no keyless real-time source (Google keyless response carries none; incident tiles are
  proprietary binary; OSM has only stale roadworks; DOT/511 needs a token + is per-state). Congestion colouring
  already shows where it's slow. See ROADMAP.
- Heading (browse-cone facing direction when stopped, where GPS course is noise): raw
  `SensorManager` `TYPE_ROTATION_VECTOR` (`core/location/HeadingProvider`) - a plain
  Android sensor, not GMS. **Navigation never uses it** (the nav heading comes from the
  matched road); it's pushed to state only in browse + only on a real change, so it can't
  spam recomposition during nav.
- Nav-puck speed fusion: raw `TYPE_LINEAR_ACCELERATION` + `TYPE_ROTATION_VECTOR`
  (`core/location/MotionProvider` → world-frame accel; `core/location/SpeedKalman` fuses it
  with GPS speed - accel predicts between fixes, each fix measures). Collected ONLY during
  nav, written into a plain array (never compose state - sensor-rate recomposition). Missing
  sensors degrade to `a = 0` = the old constant-speed dead reckoning.
- Voice: AOSP `TextToSpeech`, engine-selectable - never hard-depend on Google TTS. **Plus an
  in-process neural option (Piper):** Vela bundles the **sherpa-onnx** runtime (arm64 `.so`, from the
  `tts-runtime` release AAR - gitignored, fetched in CI, NOT committed) and downloads a **Piper VITS**
  voice into `filesDir/piper/<id>/`, run in-process by `app/voice/PiperSynth` (sherpa `OfflineTts` +
  `AudioTrack`) behind the `:core` `voice/NeuralSynth` seam (the AAR can't live in the `:core` library
  module). The default is **HFC Female** (`en_US-hfc_female-medium`, ~67 MB); it becomes the default
  voice once present. **Non-obvious, all device-only (compiler-clean):** R8 MUST `-keep class
  com.k2fsa.sherpa.onnx.**` (JNI resolves classes by original name); and you must generate the WHOLE
  utterance before `AudioTrack.play()` (streaming underruns → AudioFlinger drops the track → SIGABRT).
  The whole utterance is generated, but it's **written to the track in ~200 ms chunks with a `generation`
  check between them** (`PiperSynth`, audit 2026-07-06) so an interrupt (turn-now/rerouting/stop) takes
  effect within ~200 ms instead of blocking for the full utterance - safe against the SIGABRT rule because
  back-to-back chunk writes keep the buffer full (no underrun). **Audio-focus is refcounted via the
  utterance callbacks; two audit-2026-07-06 leaks closed:** a system-TTS `speak()` returning `ERROR`
  enqueues no utterance so no callback ever fires - `VoiceGuide.speakViaSystem` now rolls back the focus
  acquire on `ERROR`; and a failed system-TTS `onInit` used to queue every prompt into `pending` forever
  (unbounded, replayed stale on a later init) - it now clears `pending`, latches `systemInitFailed`, and
  fires `langUnavailable` instead of queueing into a void.
  **A Piper voice is a SINGLE-language model** - reading another language's nav text through it is
  gibberish (the "English voice read Russian after a language override" bug). `NeuralSynth.voiceLanguage`
  exposes the loaded voice's lang (id prefix, `en_US-hfc_female` → "en"); `VoiceGuide.speakNow` compares it
  to the language the nav text is GENERATED in (`NavStringsRegistry.current().locale`) and, on a mismatch,
  routes to **Android `TextToSpeech` in the target language instead** (`speakViaSystem`, lazily creating a
  default engine as the fallback - the system `tts` is NOT shut down when the neural voice is active). If the
  system TTS has no voice for that language either, guidance stays **silent** (never mangles it through the
  wrong voice) and fires `langUnavailable(lang)` → `MapViewModel` flashes a "get a &lt;language&gt; voice in
  Settings → Voice" hint. So switching the app/system language to one whose voice isn't downloaded degrades
  gracefully, it doesn't read the new language through the old model.
  **(History: earlier iterations bundled Kokoro (`KokoroSynth`) and Matcha; both were removed after
  on-device A/B - Kokoro was ~0.4× realtime even on a Pixel 9. `MapViewModel` reclaims their old model
  dirs and sanitizes stale `vela.kokoro`/`vela.matcha` prefs to Piper. `project_vela_kokoro_tts` memory
  is that historical record, not the current design.)**
- Nav feedback: spoken guidance (`VoiceGuide`) + **direction-coded haptic turn cues**
  (`core/feedback/Haptics`, `NavEvent.Haptic`); toggle in Settings → Navigation. **Reroute buzzes
  too (2026-07-10):** `Haptics.reroute(mode)` (three ticks + a long buzz, distinct from every turn
  pattern) fires beside the throttled spoken "Rerouting" in `NavSession.reroute` - same per-mode
  setting, works muted. Demo drives pass `travelMode` into `navSession.start` so per-mode haptics
  behave in a simulation like the real ride (they used to default to DRIVE = silent).
- EU consent: `InMemoryCookieJar` (CoreModule) pre-seeds Google's `SOCS`/`CONSENT`
  cookies so a cookieless EU session isn't bounced to `consent.google.com` - don't
  strip those, and don't let a `Set-Cookie` downgrade `CONSENT` to `PENDING`.
- No GMS: no FCM/Firebase/Play Integrity/Fused. If push is needed later, use
  UnifiedPush; crash reporting via ACRA/self-hosted Sentry.
- **Photos use a hidden WebView** (`app/web/WebPhotoFetcher`). The full gallery RPC
  (`hspqX`) serves real photos only to a real browser engine - OkHttp gets a
  bot-degraded Street-View-only reply (TLS-fingerprint detection, not headers).
  The WebView loads `maps.google.com` **anonymously (no login)** and same-origin-
  fetches the RPC. This is the one place we run Google's JS - an accepted tradeoff
  for richer photos (lazy, best-effort, OkHttp fallback). Gotchas: **desktop UA**
  (mobile UA → Google deep-links to `intent://`), block non-http(s) redirects, and
  use a `Handler` not `View.postDelayed` (a headless WebView never attaches).
- **Street View is IN-APP + keyless (2026-07-15, `streetview-inapp`).** We render the panorama
  OURSELVES rather than embed Google's WebGL page (which serves a stripped shell → black on ANGLE,
  the reason the old attempt was reverted - do NOT retry the WebView-embed path). Pipeline: (1)
  metadata via `MapDataSource.streetView` → `GoogleMapsDataSource` hits the keyless JS-API
  `GeoPhotoService.SingleImageSearch` (pb in `calibration.streetViewMetaUrl`, `{LAT}`/`{LNG}`;
  the `get()` helper's `Referer: https://www.google.com/maps/` is what authorises it), parsed by
  `:core` `StreetViewParser` (address/copyright/position live INSIDE the pano node `root[1]`, not
  root - the off-by-one trap the unit test locks; copyright is `[1][4][0][0][0]`, one deeper than
  it looks). Returns null = no coverage. (2) tiles via `MapDataSource.streetViewTile` (fixed
  template `streetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com/v1/tile`, keyless, JPEG bytes, same Google referer;
  NB `/v1/thumbnail` 403s but `/v1/tile` works - the old note tested the wrong endpoint). (3) `:app`
  `StreetViewTiles.load` stitches a zoom level's grid (v1 = zoom 2 = 2048×1024, 8 tiles, ~8 MB POT
  texture; NEVER the full 16384×8192 ≈ 400 MB), and `PanoramaView` (GLES2, `app/streetview`) textures
  it onto a sphere - drag = yaw/pitch, pinch = FOV. GL gotchas, device-proven: view from INSIDE (cull
  off), and use NATURAL U (`uv = u`, NO flip). Looking down -Z, screen-right is world +X = theta
  increasing = u increasing, so texU must increase left-to-right or the whole pano mirrors (backwards
  signage + reversed © Google watermark). An earlier `1 - u` was itself the mirror and mis-verified;
  plain `u` reads correct AND keeps drag grab-pull + the walk-arrow bearings consistent (user 2026-07-15,
  caught the mirror off the watermarks; don't reintroduce a U flip). The VM owns the bitmap lifecycle (the
  renderer does NOT recycle after `texImage2D` - texImage2D copies, so recycling there would double-free
  the state's reference); the screen feeds it once via LaunchedEffect, not the AndroidView update lambda.
  Pill is in `PlaceSheet` (no longer gated by HideExternalLinks - it's a first-class in-app surface now),
  overlay in MapScreen keyed on `state.streetView != null || streetViewLoading`. **v2 (2026-07-15):**
  zoom 3 tiles (4096×2048, sharper), 1.7x drag sensitivity, capture date (`panoNode[6][7]` = [year,month],
  shown in the attribution), **walk arrows** (`StreetViewPano.neighbors` = the local pano graph
  `[5][0][3][0]` de-cluttered to nearest-per-direction, excluding same-spot <4 m; the overlay projects
  each onto screen by `bearing - cameraYaw` within the FOV, polled each frame), and **time travel**
  (`StreetViewPano.history` = `[5][0][8]` `[neighbourIndex,[yr,mo]]` resolved through the graph + this
  pano, newest-first; a clock chip switches captures via `timeTravelStreetView`, which loads tiles by
  pano id and keeps the base metadata so the arrows/dates return). **Two gotchas, both device-caught:**
  (1) walking fetches the neighbour BY PANO ID (`streetViewByPano` -> `photometa/v1`, keyless, node
  nested one deeper at `root[1][0]` with a `)]}'` guard - the parser handles both), NOT by nearest-
  location: a location lookup snapped to a different-year same-spot capture (green May imagery under a
  "December 2022" label). (2) the `PanoramaView` must NOT be `remember`ed keyed on panoId - `AndroidView`
  runs its factory once, so a new per-pano view instance leaves the OLD view (old texture) on screen
  after a walk while the date updates (new date, stale imagery); use ONE view for the viewer's life and
  feed it new bitmaps. **Opening pano = COPY GOOGLE (2026-07-16):** the search response's SV thumbnail URL
  (`streetviewpixels-pa…/thumbnail?panoid=…&yaw=…`) carries the exact pano id + camera yaw the Google app
  opens; `SearchParser.svThumb` regexes it out of the serialized entry (a distinctive constant, drift-proof
  vs a pb path) into `Place.svPanoId`/`svYawDeg`, and `openStreetView` uses them verbatim via
  `streetViewByPano`. The heuristics (nearest pano; street-of-address match; perpendicular probes for
  set-back geocodes whose alley cluster isn't graph-connected to the frontage; perpendicular-facing with a
  ±40° nudge) are the FALLBACK for entries with no thumbnail - don't re-order that ladder: geometry alone
  provably mis-picks (the 2005-address alley saga, 3 attempts before copying Google won). **COMPASS FRAME
  (2026-07-16, the root of every "faces the wrong way"):** Google's equirect puts the CAPTURE heading at
  the texture CENTRE (u=0.5, verified by stitching a pano), while PanoramaView's yaw=0 looks at u=0.75 -
  so compass B = renderer yaw `B - captureHeading - 90`. Use `setCompass(panoHeading, faceCompass)` /
  compass-space `currentYawDeg()`; NEVER feed a compass bearing in as raw yaw, and never overwrite
  `StreetViewPano.headingDeg` (the texture reference) with a desired facing - that's `initialFacingDeg`.
  **OLD-PYRAMID GOTCHA (2026-07-16, device report "black panel on time travel"):** the tile pyramid
  is NOT one fixed shape - modern panos are 512·2^z wide but pre-2016 captures are 416·2^z (13312
  max, the 2007 gen sometimes only 4 levels), so the loader MUST size its grid from the pano's own
  `levelDims` (parsed per level from `[2][3][0]`); assuming 512·2^z requested tiles past the old
  grid's edge → black bands. `StreetViewTiles` picks the highest level ≤4096 wide, crops padded edge
  tiles, and scales a non-4096×2048 stitch up to it (GL needs POT for the 360° wrap; an old equirect
  still covers 360°×180° so scaling is exact). Time travel fetches the historical pano's OWN metadata
  by id (pyramid + heading - epochs differ by up to 180°!) and adopts its headingDeg into the shown
  pano; the screen's re-aim effect keys on headingDeg too, keeping the user's compass yaw across the
  swap. Verified live: a 2012 capture (416-pyramid) renders the full sphere.
  **Half-screen (2026-07-16):** StreetViewScreen is a top-aligned PANE (55% height, fullscreen toggle,
  Back exits fullscreen first), not a Dialog - the map stays live underneath. The viewer reports
  `onPose(lat,lng,compassYaw)` (throttled to ~per-degree) → MapScreen's `svPose: DoubleArray?` →
  VelaMapView draws the NAV PUCK + view cone (SV_SRC/SV_LAYER, data-driven `iconRotate` off the
  feature's "yaw" so a drag is one setGeoJson, identity-gated like the parking pin) and eases the
  camera to the pano on each HOP only (never per yaw frame), with `svTopInsetPx` (pane height) as
  camera TOP padding so the puck centres in the VISIBLE strip - the sheet-inset block must not
  clobber that padding while SV is open (it's gated on svPose==null; the SV close path restores it).
  PlaceSheet yields while SV is up (the bottom half must stay pure map). Mini-map TAP = pegman-drop:
  handleTap in VelaMapView pre-empts ALL other tap resolution while `svActive` and hands the LatLng to
  `onSvMapTap` → `moveStreetViewTo` (nearest pano, faceToward the tap; <8 m from the pano → down-street).
  FULLSCREEN GOTCHA (device-caught 2026-07-16): a SurfaceView's window hole does NOT follow a
  pure-Compose resize - the GL render grew but stayed cropped in the old half-screen hole. The
  PanoramaView is `remember(full)` (recreated on toggle) wrapped in `key(view) { AndroidView(...) }`
  (key() forces AndroidView to actually swap instances), with view-keyed effects re-feeding the texture
  and the CURRENT yaw (seenPano tracks pano-change vs view-change so a toggle keeps your look direction
  and a walk faces the new pano's initialFacing). The renderer's zoom is
  canonically the HORIZONTAL fov (fovX) - a fixed vertical fov made fullscreen NARROW the view
  ("it just zoomed"); holding fovX keeps framing and reveals more sky/ground, and fovX is also what
  the arrow overlay projects across the screen width. Remaining:
  walking can cross capture epochs (Google stays in-epoch; the neighbour entries carry no date to filter
  on), higher-zoom on pinch.
- **Routing is OPEN, not Google (2026-06-28).** Turn-by-turn comes from **FOSSGIS OSRM**
  (`RouteGeometry.route`, `steps=true`, per-mode `routed-car`/`-bike`/`-foot`) - complete,
  street-named maneuvers + real geometry. **Highways identify by `ref` not `name`** - `parseOsrmRoute`
  captures `ref`/`destinations`/`exits` (not just `name`) and `osrmPhrase` uses them ("Take exit 72B
  toward …"); `Maneuver.ref` feeds the banner shield even when the text shows a name (fixed 2026-06-30 - 
  before, highway steps were nameless + shield-less). **`routeOsrm` retries 3× w/ backoff** - a transient
  community-server blip otherwise drops nav to Google's abbreviated (nameless) steps. **And
  `googleDirectionsRetried` gives the GOOGLE side the same 3-attempt backoff (2026-07-14):** it had
  ONE shot, and a single degraded/empty keyless reply cost the whole fetch its traffic ratio,
  jam-snap and alternates - the picker then led with white-ETA free-flow OSRM routes that read
  minutes faster than the traffic-aware set and varied wildly between restarts (real-drive report).
  **Abbreviated fallback routes are TAGGED (`Route.abbreviatedSteps`, set on the OSRM-down branches
  + the nameRoute failure path) and SELF-HEAL:** `maybeRecheck` silently adopts a full-stepped
  same-course candidate over an adopted abbreviated route (same 250 m divergence test the ETA
  calibration uses), so a mid-drive OSRM blip no longer leaves the banner disagreeing with the
  blue line for the rest of the drive. **Since 2026-07-15 the same heal restores LIVE TRAFFIC
  (trafficUpgrade beside stepsUpgrade, no-downgrade guard on both); since 2026-08-04 a DEGRADED
  route also SHORTENS the recheck cadence (DEGRADED_RECHECK_INTERVAL_MS 20 s, capped at
  DEGRADED_FAST_TRIES=6 per route then back to ~2 min, issue #237) so the heal lands seconds
  after the open router recovers instead of leaving the nameless banner up for minutes, and a degraded candidate is
  FENCED OUT of everything ETA-comparative in maybeRecheck: trafficless never calibrates etaScale
  and trafficless-or-abbreviated is never OFFERED as a faster route - free-flow vs traffic-aware
  always "wins", which was the real-drive white-ETA/no-lanes/"suspiciously fast" incident (lanes
  come from OSRM steps, so an accepted abbreviated route also silently loses lane guidance).** Google's keyless
  `/maps/preview/directions` returns
  **abbreviated** steps for longer routes (a 6-mi route came back with 2 of ~10 turns), so it's
  demoted to (a) the **live-traffic source** - `GoogleMapsDataSource.applyTraffic` scales OSRM's
  free-flow duration by Google's in-traffic/typical ratio and maps its congestion spans onto the
  OSRM geometry - and (b) the **fallback router** when OSRM is unreachable. The two are fetched in
  parallel. Rationale: routing is a solved open-data problem; Google's edge is traffic/POIs/hours/
  reviews, not routing. **`OSRM_BASE` is the FOSSGIS community server (fair-use) - point at a
  self-hosted OSRM/Valhalla before any real release.** (This retired the keyless-step parsing as the
  primary path + the Nominatim "fill the missing road name" hack.)
- **Traffic-AWARE routing (option 3, 2026-06-28).** OSRM's free-flow route ignores live traffic, so
  when Google *rerouted around a jam* its path differs from OSRM's. `directions()` detects this
  (`RouteGeometry.divergent` - sample Google's polyline, true if any point strays >700 m from OSRM's
  line) and, only then, re-runs OSRM **through ~12 points sampled off Google's polyline**
  (`sampleVias` → `routeVia`) so we follow Google's jam-avoiding path *with* full OSRM street-named
  steps. Multi-waypoint OSRM returns one leg per via with spurious `arrive`+`depart` at each boundary
 - `parseOsrmRoute` filters all but the true first-depart/last-arrive. Free-flow routes (the common
  case) stay pure OSRM, untouched. The traffic-snapped route leads **only when it earns it** - its live
  ETA must be ≤ OSRM free-flow best × `SNAP_ETA_MARGIN` (1.2), else a divergent-but-not-faster snap steps
  aside for OSRM's clean route (fixed 2026-06-30 - the old code always led with the snap on divergence, the
  "fucky reroute"). The `directions` diag logs `snapKept`/`gEta`/`osrmFF` to tune the margin from real
  side-by-side data. **Per-alternate re-rank (2026-07-01):** each Google route in `root[0][1]` carries its
  OWN `duration_in_traffic` (`parseRoute` reads `summary[10][0][0]` per route), so the returned list is now
  **sorted by live in-traffic ETA - fastest leads, Google-style.** (Earlier note that this was "impossible"
  was wrong: it's only true for the OSRM-only alts, which share `gTop`'s ratio; Google's alts carry real
  per-route traffic.) **Sort key = the EXACT value the picker shows (2026-07-05, supersedes the earlier
  `* gRatio` "common-axis" attempt):** `compareBy({ durationInTrafficSeconds ?: durationSeconds }, { provisional })`.
  `RouteOption` displays `durationInTrafficSeconds ?: durationSeconds` and tags the min-SHOWN route "Fastest", so
  the sort MUST use the same expression - else (as `* gRatio` did) the top/selected route and the "Fastest"-tagged
  route diverge and the fastest-shown route isn't at the top (a real-drive bug, fixed). The axis is already fair
  without the fudge factor: PRIMARY routes go through `applyTraffic` (their `durationInTrafficSeconds` = free-flow
  × the top Google route's ratio) and Google's alternates carry their own per-route `duration_in_traffic`, so a
  route only falls back to raw `durationSeconds` when there's genuinely no traffic signal for it - and then
  sorting/showing that free-flow time is self-consistent. Do NOT bake an estimate onto `durationInTrafficSeconds`
  to "fix the axis" - `Route.hasLiveTraffic` keys off its nullness. Provisional routes are the stable tie-break.
  **Alternates = GOOGLE's own alternate routes, NAME-ON-PICK (2026-06-30):** we fetch all of Google's
  routes but used only the top; `directions()` now returns the named primary + each distinct Google route
  as a **provisional** `Route` (`Route.provisional` - polyline + live ETA now, turn-by-turn deferred),
  `dedupeRoutes`, prefers them over OSRM's free-flow alts, caps at `MAX_ROUTES`=4. Picking a provisional
  alternate (`MapViewModel.selectRoute` → `MapDataSource.nameRoute`, also on `startNav` as a safety) NAMES
  it - currently by snapping its polyline through OSRM (`routeVia`, guarded to reach dest) + re-applying
  Google's traffic. So only the route you drive gets snapped, and the picker loads fast. **Next = swap
  `nameRoute`'s snap for on-device GraphHopper MAP-MATCH where the region's downloaded** (wobble-free); the
  snap stays the fallback. (NB: MapLibre vector tiles only cover the on-screen area, so they can't name a
  whole long route - a universal-clean version would need fetching+decoding the route's MVT tiles.)
- **Why not "always snap to Google's path"?** (measured 2026-06-28, the serverless question.) Google's
  keyless **polyline is complete** (decoded from `root[0][7][i]`) even though its *step text* is
  abbreviated - so we *can* always trace it. But doing it cleanly needs **map-matching**, and the
  public infra won't reliably give it: FOSSGIS **`/match` caps at 10 trace coords** (11+ → `TooBig`;
  confidence ~0.01 at that sparsity) and public **Valhalla `/trace_route` times out**. The serverless
  fallback - dense-waypoint `/route` (40–100 vias, no cap) - *does* reproduce Google's path exactly,
  **but a via landing on a turn gets swallowed into a via arrive/depart → ~1-in-10 named turns lost**
  (measured: dropped "turn right onto Village Green Drive"). That turn-loss is the exact bug we fixed,
  so we do **not** always-snap. Clean always-snap (and offline routing) is gated on an **on-device
  engine** - see the next bullet. Option 3 is the public-server stopgap and stays as the online/fallback
  path. **No backend needed for any of this** (the serverless constraint holds).
- **OBF MIGRATION IN PROGRESS (2026-07-23, issue #214; user sold on the format;
  DEVICE-VERIFIED on the 4a in airplane mode - see the canary numbers below).** Offline
  routing's successor is OsmAnd's `.obf`: `ObfRouteEngine` (:core) routes with OsmAnd's pure-Java
  router (GPLv3, vendored jars in `core/libs/` - gitignored, CI fetches from the `obf-runtime`
  release like the sherpa AAR; locally copy osmand-java.jar / osmand-shared-jvm.jar /
  gnu-trove-osmand.jar / kxml2-vela.jar from that release). MEASURED WHY: Berlin from the same PBF = GraphHopper
  graph 105 MB vs obf routing section 26.9 MB (3.9x); a target-sections obf (routing+address+POI,
  NO map/transport - `scripts/VelaObfShim.java` sets the IndexCreatorSettings booleans the CLI
  lacks) makes Germany ~2 GB where graph+pack was ~8. `OfflineRouteEngine` (CoreModule) tries obf
  then GraphHopper, so pre-cutover graphs keep working; avoids (toll/motorway) are DYNAMIC
  routing.xml params (`avoid_toll`/`avoid_highway`) so they work offline with no baked profiles,
  and bicycle/pedestrian profiles come free. Turn mapping pinned by ObfRouteEngineTest (CONTINUE
  is voice-silent - a mis-mapped u-turn gets swallowed; instruction text reuses ghPhrase so all
  languages come along). Bake: `scripts/build-obf-region.sh` + `merge-obf-manifest.sh` +
  `.github/workflows/obf-regions.yml` (matrix clone; the MapCreator tool is pinned on the
  `obf-tools` release); assets are RAW .obf (already deflate-compressed inside; download size ==
  installed size). CUTOVER = the manifest, and the world bake STAGES it (2026-08-03): dispatching obf-regions
  with the default staging=true merges entries into `obf-manifest-staging.json`, which the app
  never reads - bake every group there, then ONE `gh release download/upload` copy of staging
  over the live name flips the whole catalog atomically (region-by-region merging into the live
  manifest would have shown early updaters a half-empty region list while the legacy catalog
  vanished). CUTOVER = the manifest: `refreshRoutingRegions` serves the obf catalog
  (`OBF_MANIFEST_URL`, `-PobfManifestUrl=` override) whenever obf-manifest.json has entries, else
  the legacy graph catalog - dispatching the obf-regions workflow IS the switch, no app release.
  The trade: no precomputed shortcuts, so a cross-city route costs seconds not ~200 ms (offline is
  the FALLBACK router, so size beats speed - user call); OsmAnd's HH precomputed mode is the
  follow-up if long routes measure slow on-device. **4a canary numbers (2026-07-23, release build,
  airplane mode, Berlin obf):** 1.6 km drive = 288 ms; 21 km cross-city drive = 9.1 s (252
  segments); same trip walking = 15.9 s. Steps carry names + B-road shields + sign destinations;
  delete via Settings removes the region and the engine drops its readers. **THREE ANDROID
  RUNTIME TRAPS, all invisible until the engine LOGGED its failures (tag `VelaObf` - the first
  canary swallowed them silently and read as "No drive route found"):** (1) commons-logging picks
  LogFactoryImpl by REFLECTIVE discovery, so R8 strips it and BinaryMapIndexReader's static init
  dies - consumer-rules keeps `org.apache.commons.logging.**`, and the discovery itself NPEs on
  ART anyway, so ObfRouteEngine's init pins `org.apache.commons.logging.Log` ->
  SimpleLog before any OsmAnd class loads. (2) OsmAnd instantiates `org.kxml2.io.KXmlParser`
  directly (a desktop-classpath assumption; modern Android hides its platform copy from apps) -
  `kxml2-vela.jar` on the obf-runtime release is upstream kxml2 2.3.0 with its bundled
  org/xmlpull/** deleted, because the stock Maven jar duplicates the platform XmlPullParser
  interfaces and R8 hard-fails ("Library class ... implements program class"). (3)
  `searchRoute` UNCONDITIONALLY lazy-loads the world-regions index (its missing-maps suggestion
  feature) from the working directory, which on Android is / and read-only -> EROFS on every
  route; the init pre-seeds `PlatformUtil.setOsmandRegions(OsmandRegions(false))` (the no-file
  ctor) and turns `RoutePlannerFrontEnd.CALCULATE_MISSING_MAPS` off (the flag alone does NOT
  skip the load - the getOsmandRegions call sits before the flag check). STILL GH-ONLY: the speed-limit badge
  (currentRoadLimit) and the romanized-names sidecar (obf carries multilingual names natively,
  wired later). Place packs still download alongside obf regions until POI/address search moves
  onto the obf (phase 2). COUNTRY + SUB-AREA both (2026-08-03, the #214 reporter's ask): the unsplit
  country stays the headline row, and big countries ALSO offer first-level sub-areas as smaller
  optional rows - tools/routing-regions.json carries the 16 `de-*` Bundesland rows (group
  `germany-sub`, named "<Land> (Germany)") beside the whole-Germany row (group `europe`,
  big:true), so the obf bake can produce both; nobody is forced into fragments and a city user
  grabs ~130 MB instead of ~2 GB. Extend the same pattern (fr-sub etc.) only when a country's
  obf actually lands huge.
- **On-device routing engine = GraphHopper (`core/data/RouteEngine` + `GraphHopperRouteEngine`).**
  Pure-JVM, runs on ART - **validated end-to-end on a Pixel 5a** (`:ghprobe`, a throwaway instrumented
  probe - the routing shipped long ago; the module is safe to delete whenever). Chosen over Valhalla (no maintained Android map-matching binding) /
  BRouter (no street names) / Mapbox (token-gated). It's wired as a `:core` dep
  (`libs.graphhopper.mapmatching`, **OSM-import deps excluded** - osmosis/protobuf/woodstox/xmlgraphics
  are Android-hostile + only needed to *build* graphs, which we do off-device). **Three ART workarounds,
  all in `GraphHopperRouteEngine` - don't remove:** (1) **`graph.dataaccess=MMAP`** (default RAMDataAccess
  static-inits a JDK-16 `VarHandle` method ART lacks); (2) **override `createWeightingFactory()`** to a
  hand-rolled `SpeedWeighting`+access-block (v11 compiles custom models via **Janino** → JVM bytecode ART
  can't load); (3) **swallow `close()`** (MMAP unmap uses `Unsafe.invokeCleaner`, absent on Android - keep
  one engine for the process lifetime). **Three MORE ART gaps, all pre-API-34, all fixed so offline graphs
  LOAD below Android 14 (contributed by ars18, ported 2026-07-17 - before this, a downloaded graph loaded on
  API 34+ ONLY; the `:ghprobe` device was on 14 so it was never caught):** (4) the custom model is built
  PROGRAMMATICALLY via `carModel()` instead of `GHUtility.loadCustomModelFromJar("car.json")` - the jar's
  loader makes Jackson bean-introspect `Statement` (a Java 17 record), which needs `Class.getRecordComponents`
  (ART API 34+); record CONSTRUCTORS work everywhere, only the reflection probe is missing. `carModel()` MUST
  mirror the jar's `car.json` exactly (the CH profile version hashes are keyed on the model) - `GraphHopperRouterTest.carModelMatchesJar` asserts it and fails on any GraphHopper-upgrade drift; (5) profiles are
  set AFTER `init()` via `hopper.setProfiles`/`chPreparationHandler.setCHProfiles`, never inside the cfg -
  `init()` force-round-trips every profile's model through Jackson (same record probe); (6) `MMapDataAccess`
  reads graph segments with the JDK-13 absolute-bulk `ByteBuffer.get/put(int,byte[],int,int)` (ART API 34+),
  so a **buildSrc artifact transform** (`GraphHopperByteBufferPatch`, ASM) rewrites exactly those 6 call
  sites in `graphhopper-core-*.jar` to `app.vela.core.util.ByteBufferCompat` (`duplicate()+position()`,
  API 1, byte-identical). `buildSrc` carries NO AGP dep (AGP there splits the plugin classloaders). **R8:** `consumer-rules.pro` keeps `com.graphhopper.**` + hppc/jts/
  jackson wholesale (GraphHopper resolves a lot reflectively) and `-dontwarn`s the excluded/absent refs - 
  release build is clean (**but +~10 MB APK; tighter keeps / on-demand delivery is a later optimisation**).
  Graphs are built off-device, one per region, and (Phase 1b) downloaded alongside the offline tiles;
  `RouteEngine` is selected by connectivity + graph-presence. **Speed needs Contraction Hierarchies:**
  plain flexible A* with the interpreted `SpeedWeighting` was **7.6 s** for a 24-mi trip on a Pixel 5a;
  **CH prepared on the SAME `SpeedWeighting`** (the engine declares `setCHProfiles`, `tools/graphbuilder`
  builds it) → **188 ms**. Graphs MUST be built with CH on that weighting (CH bakes the build-time
  weighting), to **internal** storage (FUSE external was I/O-bound). **`SpeedWeighting` ETA gotcha:** it
  reports time as `distance_m/speed` as if `car_average_speed` (km/h) were m/s - 3.6× too fast - so the
  engine AND `graphbuilder` override `calcEdgeMillis` to `distance_m·3600/kmh`; keep them identical.
  **Encoded values = `car_access, car_average_speed, road_access, max_speed`** - the string is byte-identical
  in `GraphBuilder.java` and `GraphHopperRouteEngine.kt` (a mismatch fails graph load); keep it so.
  **Highway refs/destinations are NOT encoded values (learned 2026-07-13, saved a world rebake):** GraphHopper
  stores `street_ref`/`street_destination`/`street_destination_ref`/`motorway_junction` as per-edge KEY-VALUES
  whenever `parseWayNames` is on - and it defaults ON and GraphBuilder never disabled it, so every graph ever
  shipped already carries them (same storage that makes `Instruction.getName()` work offline).
  `InstructionsFromEdges` copies them onto each instruction's `extraInfoJSON`; `toRoute` reads them so offline
  steps get shields (`Maneuver.ref`), "toward" sign text and "Take exit N" phrasing like the OSRM path
  (`road = name ?: ref`; a fork/ramp carrying `motorway_junction` uses the off-ramp phrase). NB GraphHopper
  joins a multi-ref with ", " where OSRM keeps ";" - the shield pick splits on both. Verified against a fresh
  unchanged-config bake: refs/destinations present on a 47 mi toll-road route's instructions. `max_speed`
  (added 2026-07-04) is the OSM `maxspeed` posted limit (km/h), a **passive stored column** (`OSMMaxSpeedParser`
  auto-registers; NOT in the weighting/CH, so it doesn't change routes) read by the speed-limit badge via
  `GraphHopperRouteEngine.currentRoadLimit(lat,lng)` - a `LocationIndex` snap + `EdgeIteratorState.get` off the
  **base graph** (CH-safe). **Adding/removing an encoded value is a BREAKING graph-format change**: old graphs
  lack the EV and `getDecimalEncodedValue` THROWS - `currentRoadLimit` swallows it (badge hidden, no crash),
  but to actually light the badge up you must **re-bake + re-host every region graph** via `routing-graphs.yml`
  (verified: a Monaco rebuild carries `max_speed` + CH cleanly). Existing installs keep their old graphs until
  re-downloaded (no version-discriminator yet - a manifest `schema` bump so they auto-update is a follow-up).
  **Status: DONE end-to-end, on-device verified, graphs HOSTED + multi-region.** `RoutingGraphStore` (`:app`)
  downloads region CH graphs from a manifest (`BuildConfig.ROUTING_MANIFEST_URL`, override `-ProutingManifestUrl=`
  for local testing) into `filesDir/graphs/<id>/`, merging each into `filesDir/graphs/index.json`
  (`[{id,bbox:[S,W,N,E]}]`); `GraphHopperRouteEngine` lazy-loads a `GraphHopper` per region and routes a trip on
  the **smallest region whose bbox covers BOTH endpoints**, falling through to the next-smallest if that
  graph can't make the trip (`inBox`, unit-tested). Smallest-first because Geofabrik extract boxes carry a
  buffer that spills across borders (British Columbia's box dips into the metro) - the same rule drives the
  picker's "covers your location" label + the tiles→routing combine, so all three agree. Settings → **Offline** (one
  section: a **Map area** subhead = viewport tile download, and a **Routing regions** subhead = the picker) is
  a location-aware picker (regions covering the GPS fix sort first + flag "covers your location"; a name
  filter appears once the catalog is large); downloading
  offline map *tiles* for an area ALSO pulls that area's routing region (`MapViewModel.downloadRoutingForArea`).
  `directions()` uses the engine when OSRM is empty. A trip must fit ONE region's monolithic graph (cross-region
  → online).
  **Hosting + world catalog (DONE 2026-06-30):** graphs + `routing-manifest.json` are assets on the
  **`routing-graphs` GitHub release** (fixed-tag prerelease, never the "Latest" the APK tracks). The catalog is
  **`tools/routing-regions.json`** (135 regions, grouped by continent; `big:true` = country-sized). CI
  **`.github/workflows/routing-graphs.yml`** is a **race-safe matrix**: `prep` (group/ids → matrix) → parallel
  `build` (each region: `graphbuilder` CH graph → upload its own `<id>.zip` + emit a manifest *entry* artifact,
  via `scripts/build-routing-region.sh MANIFEST_MODE=emit`) → one `merge` (`scripts/merge-routing-manifest.sh`
  folds all entries into the manifest in a single replace-by-id upload - parallel jobs never clobber it; a
  `concurrency: routing-graphs-manifest` guard also serializes whole runs so back-to-back dispatches queue
  instead of racing two merge jobs). Public
  -repo Actions minutes are free, so a continent builds per dispatch. **bbox MUST come from `osmium -g
  header.boxes`** (declared extract region) - `data.bbox` (node extent) is polluted by outlier nodes and made
  Oregon falsely cover WA. Build one region locally: `scripts/build-routing-region.sh <id> "<name>" <pbf-url>`
  (all-in-one), or the graph alone: `./gradlew :tools:graphbuilder:run --args="region.osm.pbf out-dir"`. Local
  manifest test: serve a manifest+graph, `adb reverse tcp:8099 tcp:8099`, build with
  `-ProutingManifestUrl=http://127.0.0.1:8099/manifest.json` (localhost cleartext allowed by
  `res/xml/network_security_config.xml`; all other traffic stays HTTPS).
- **Offline PLACE packs - whole-region POI/address search, Organic-Maps-style (`app/offline/PoiPackStore` +
  `core/data/OfflinePacks`, DONE 2026-07-07, device-verified: a misspelled offline search ("pel meni") from the
  downloaded test suburb → the intended dumpling restaurant in a city across the state, with address).** Downloading a state (routing region) also pulls its place pack - a
  per-region SQLite db baked by CI from the SAME Geofabrik PBF (`scripts/build-poi-region.sh`: osmium
  tags-filter → export geojsonseq → `poipack_build.py` → SQLite → zip; workflow `poi-packs.yml`, a matrix clone
  of routing-graphs.yml with `merge-poi-manifest.sh`; release tag `poi-packs`, manifest
  `poi-pack-manifest.json`, `POI_PACK_MANIFEST_URL` / `-PpoiPackManifestUrl=`). **Pack schema is NORMALIZED,
  not the app stores' own schema** (that naive shape was 761 MB for WA): `poi(id,name,lat,lng,category,address,
  phone,website,hours)` + `streetname(sid,street,street_norm)` + `addr(hn,sid,city,lat,lng)` +
  `streetpt(sid,lat,lng)` → WA = 335 MB raw / **143 MB zipped** (163k POIs, 2.8M addrs, 1.2M street pts, 92k
  street names). The normalization is also the QUERY strategy: match street names first (~90k-row scan), hit
  the big tables only through sid/hn/lat indexes - never a LIKE scan of millions of rows. `OfflinePacks`
  (:core singleton) holds the opened read-only dbs; `OfflinePoiStore.search` runs its same SQL on each pack
  (identical poi columns), `OfflineAddressStore` has dedicated pack paths (`packSids`/`packQuery`/
  `packStreetGeom` + reverse-geocode JOINs) merged into query()/streetGeom()/reverseGeocode(); counts include
  packs. `poipack_build.py` PORTS `normalizeStreet`'s ABBREV and OverpassPois' category formatting - keep them
  in sync. Lifecycle: pack downloads after its region's graph (`downloadPoiPack`), deletes with it
  (`deleteRoutingGraph`), `registerPacks()` at VM init; graphs installed before packs get a **"Get places"**
  button on the Settings row (`downloadPoiPackFor`, with a "no pack published yet" status when the manifest
  lacks the region). **Heads-up progress:** `RegionDownloadCard` in MapScreen mirrors the voice card - 
  `routingDownloadingId`/`routingDownloadPct` then `poiPackDownloadingId`/`poiPackDownloadPct`, named by
  `regionDownloadName`. Local pack test: build one with the script's osmium+python steps, serve manifest+zip
  on :8099, `adb reverse`, `-PpoiPackManifestUrl=http://127.0.0.1:8099/poi-pack-manifest.json`. **After
  pushing, dispatch Actions → "Build offline place packs"** (group=us etc.) to publish packs + manifest - 
  until then "Get places" reports no pack available.
  **Pack freshness (2026-07-07): rev + monthly cron + row-level deltas.** Manifest rows carry
  `rev`/`updatedAt`/`counts{poi,addr,streetpt,streetname}` and optionally `delta{fromRev,url,sizeMb}`;
  `poi-packs.yml` has a monthly `schedule` cron (3rd, 07:15 UTC) whose prep step selects ALL catalog regions.
  `build-poi-region.sh` reads the LIVE manifest for the old rev, downloads the previous zip BEFORE clobbering
  it, builds the delta (`scripts/poipack_delta.py`, SQL EXCEPT per table into del_/ins_ tables), and publishes
  it only when it is under half the full size. App: installed revs in `poipacks/revs.json`
  (`PoiPackStore.installedRev`); Settings shows "Update available" + an **Update places** button when the
  manifest rev is newer; `MapViewModel.downloadPoiPack(update=true)` applies the delta via
  `PoiPackStore.applyDelta` ONLY when installedRev == deltaFromRev, else full download. applyDelta runs one
  transaction (delete-by-full-row via a rowid JOIN with NULL-safe `IS` matching, then insert), verifies every
  table count against the manifest before committing, and re-registers packs on both success and failure.
  **sids are STABLE content hashes** - SHA-1 of `street_norm` truncated to a positive 63-bit int, collision
  fails the build; NEVER a counter (a counter renumbers millions of rows on one mid-order insertion and the
  delta balloons to pack size). `TABLE_COLUMNS` in PoiPackStore mirrors `poipack_build.py` +
  `poipack_delta.py` - keep all three in sync (`PRAGMA user_version=2`). Gotcha: KDoc in PoiPackStore must
  not contain a literal `del_*/ins_*` (the `*/` ends the comment). `OfflinePoiStore.search` orders
  whole-query name matches first so they survive the internal 400-row cap (thousands of category hits used
  to crowd out an exact name match in a state pack; found live while verifying deltas). v1-format packs
  (published before rev existed) have no rev; their first v2 rebuild yields no usable delta so clients just
  full-download once, then deltas kick in.
- **Offline forward geocoder - typed address → coordinate, no signal (`core/data/OfflineAddressStore` +
  `OverpassPois.fetchAddresses`/`fetchStreets`, DONE 2026-07-07, device-verified in the test suburb).** So an arbitrary
  typed street address routes offline (not only addresses that are an indexed POI). Populated when a map area is
  downloaded (`MapViewModel.downloadOfflinePois`) from keyless Overpass over a bbox **padded to a ~15 km min span
  around the viewport centre** (`GEOCODE_PAD_DEG=0.09`, so a saved area covers the surrounding metro, not the few
  on-screen tiles - the tile-viewport bbox gave only 8 addresses; the padded box gave **8591 addresses + 1466
  streets**). TWO OSM sources into ONE SQLite db (`vela_offline_addr.db`, v2): **`addr:housenumber` points**
  (`addr` table) for house-precise hits, and **named road centrelines** (`street` table, thinned to ~1 pt/120 m
  by `toStreetPts`) for a street-level fallback where OSM has the road but no house numbers (the US-suburb
  reality - this is the SAME gap the OpenAddresses/Microsoft *render* overlays fill, but those are PMTiles, not
  queryable as a geocoder, so the geocoder uses OSM). `geocode()` is layered: (1) exact house number, (2)
  **interpolate** between the two bracketing mapped numbers, (3) nearest mapped house on the street, (4) nearest
  point on the street centreline. `normalizeStreet` expands abbreviations both ways ("Pl"↔"place", "SE"↔
  "southeast") so all spellings hit the same rows. Wired into the offline search branch (`MapViewModel`, gated by
  `OfflineAddressStore.looksLikeAddress` so "coffee" doesn't hit it) AND the network-error fallback; `haveArea`
  counts `count()`+`streetCount()` so a street-only suburb isn't misreported "no data". Big Overpass bodies → the
  no-call-timeout `offlineDownloadHttp` (same rule as the graph/overlay downloads). The result Place routes
  through the normal GraphHopper offline engine. Device-verified wifi-off: a typed nearby street address → *5 min
  · 1.5 mi* through the offline engine. **Reverse-geocode backfill for offline POIs:** most US chains have no OSM
  `addr:*` (Applebee's came back as bare "WA"), so `MapViewModel.backfillOfflineAddress` - on selecting a place
  while offline, when its address has no house number (`.none { isDigit() }`) - calls
  `OfflineAddressStore.reverseGeocode(loc)` (nearest mapped house ≤60 m, else nearest street ≤150 m, bounded
  lat/lng box scan) and fills `selected.address` if still selected. Device-verified: the offline Applebee's
  card backfilled to its full street address. **Quiet offline indicator (no banner):** `MapUiState.offline` (a reactive
  `ConnectivityManager` default-network callback, `observeConnectivity`, fails safe to online) drives a greyed
  globe-slash + "Offline" in `SearchBar` (bare map only) and a globe-slash chip **inline under the category
  chips** in `MapScreen`'s top Column (gated to the same bare-map state the chips show in, so it never trails a
  results list) - the old "Offline results" status line and the old bottom-left chip are gone. **The directions
  ETA subtitle** (`PlaceSheet.DepartTimeChooser`) only says "current traffic" when `route.hasLiveTraffic`; an
  offline (traffic-less) route shows the arrival time with no traffic note. **Upgrade nudge:** the address
  index is built at download time, so areas saved before the geocoder have tiles+POIs but no addresses.
  Settings → Offline shows a "Update saved areas" card when `regions.isNotEmpty() && offlineAddressCount == 0`
  (via `MapViewModel.offlineAddressCount`); tapping it runs `refreshOfflineDataForSavedAreas` - iterates every
  saved `OfflineRegion`, reads its `OfflineMaps.boundsOf` and re-runs `downloadOfflinePois` over each box.
- **Open building-footprint overlay (`app/offline/OverlayTileStore` + `VelaMapView`, DONE 2026-07-04,
  device-verified in the test suburb).** Fills the map's building gaps where OSM is thin (a suburb the
  Microsoft→OSM import never reached) with **Microsoft US Building Footprints (ODbL)**. Off-device, CI bakes
  ONE `.pmtiles` per US state (`scripts/build-overlay-region.sh` → tippecanoe `-l building -Z14 -z16
  --drop-densest-as-needed`; `-Z14` not `-Z12` - starting at z12 ballooned WA to 271 MB, z14 → 197 MB) →
  `building-overlays` GitHub release + `building-overlay-manifest.json`, matrix workflow
  `.github/workflows/building-overlays.yml` (clone of the routing one, `MANIFEST_MODE=emit` +
  `scripts/merge-overlay-manifest.sh`), catalog `tools/overlay-regions.json`. In-app: `OverlayTileStore` is a
  single-file sibling of `RoutingGraphStore` (`filesDir/overlays/<id>.pmtiles` + `index.json`; PMTiles-magic
  guard). **The overlay STREAMS online - no download needed to see houses (2026-07-05).** `refreshBuildingOverlays`
  runs on every camera-idle (`onViewport`) and emits, per view, a list of full `pmtiles://` URIs: a
  **`pmtiles://file://<abs-path>`** for any DOWNLOADED region (offline), and **`pmtiles://https://…<region>.pmtiles`**
  for the covering regions in view that AREN'T downloaded - the **UNION of up to the 3 smallest covering
  boxes, NOT just the single smallest (2026-07-06)**: a neighbour's rectangular bbox can spill across an
  irregular border AND be smaller - Kansas's box crosses the Missouri River, covers all of NW Missouri
  (St Joseph) and beats Missouri's box, but kansas.pmtiles is EMPTY east of the river, so the old
  single-pick rendered NO footprints there (probed: the doll-museum z15 tile has 413 features in
  missouri.pmtiles vs 36 river-bank scraps in kansas's; the data was never the problem). Streaming the
  union lets whichever archive has the data paint; an empty region's range requests cost ~nothing - MapLibre 11.7+ reads that hosted archive by
  **HTTP range requests** (verified: GitHub release assets 302→release-assets host with `accept-ranges: bytes`,
  MapLibre follows the redirect), fetching only the visible tiles, so footprints appear as you pan. The manual
  **`MapViewModel.downloadOverlayForArea`** (still smallest-covering-box, pulled alongside the area's tiles) is now
  ONLY for going fully offline. Render: `VelaMapView`'s `LaunchedEffect(buildingOverlays, styleRef, darkTheme)`
  adds each URI as a `VectorSource` (used verbatim - the URI already carries `pmtiles://file://` or
  `pmtiles://https://`) + a `FillLayer` `setSourceLayer("building")` **`addLayerBelow` the OSM `building` layer**,
  themed to the exact OSM building fill/outline (`#323f54`/`#3f4e66` dark, `#dde1e7`/`#c4c9d1` light) so overlay
  footprints are indistinguishable from real OSM ones and OSM still wins wherever it has data. `buildingOverlays`
  is de-duped so panning within one region doesn't churn the map sources. **The load-bearing DOWNLOAD bug was NOT
  the render** - it was the `callTimeout(0)` rule above: the 197 MB body aborted at the shared client's 12 s cap,
  silently (that only ever mattered for the offline download; streaming reads a few KB/tile). Device-verified:
  the downloaded test suburb from the local file + downtown/suburban Reno (Nevada, not downloaded) streamed from the hosted
  `nevada.pmtiles` (131 range requests, no PMTiles errors). NB GitHub release hosting works but isn't a CDN - a
  real deployment should host the PMTiles behind a CDN for snappier range reads. `OVERLAY_MANIFEST_URL`
  BuildConfig overridable `-PoverlayManifestUrl=` like routing. BREAKING-ish: an overlay is DATA (ODbL), orthogonal
  to the app's GPLv3, obligation met by tippecanoe `--attribution` + the release publishing derived tiles under ODbL.
  **World catalog (`tools/overlay-regions.json`, 361 rows - ~250 base regions plus chunk pieces):** TWO Microsoft sources picked by each row's
  `source`, both handled by the ONE build script (`SOURCE` env): **`us-legacy`** = a US state's single
  `.geojson.zip` (Microsoft US Building Footprints, 51 states+DC); **`ms-global`** = a world country's
  quadkey-partitioned GeoJSONL from Microsoft's **Global ML Building Footprints** (`global-buildings/dataset-links.csv`
  → `awk` the country's `Location` rows → curl+gunzip each `.csv.gz` into one ndjson → tippecanoe `-P`; ~199
  countries). Country **bboxes are the union of the dataset's own z9 quadkey tiles** (self-consistent with where
  footprints exist); US-state bboxes are Geofabrik extract bounds. **Big countries are CHUNKED** (>1500 MB
  compressed source → India, Brazil, Russia, Germany, Japan, …18 of them): the catalog splits each into
  sub-national pieces by **quadkey PREFIX** (`qkprefix`; adaptive recursive split until each chunk ≤ ~1500 MB - 
  India → 24 pieces), the build script's awk filters the country's rows to that prefix, and each chunk gets its
  own union bbox so the **app's smallest-covering-box rule picks the piece covering the user** (no app change,
  and it fits CI disk + hosts under GitHub's 2 GB/asset limit). Only the whole-US aggregate + continental
  aggregates + duplicate Locations (CzechRepublic→Czechia, DemocraticRepublicoftheCongo→CongoDRC) are dropped.
  The catalog is 361 regions - **over GitHub's 256-job matrix cap** - so each row carries a `group` (`us` / `world`
  / `chunk`) and dispatch is **one group at a time** (`-f group=world`); run-level concurrency is OFF so groups
  build concurrently, only the merge job serialises. The app/manifest are source-AGNOSTIC - the emitted manifest
  row is always `{id,name,url(asset),sizeMb,bbox}`, so no app change was needed for countries OR chunks.
- **Open house-number overlay (`VelaMapView` + `scripts/build-address-region.sh`, DONE 2026-07-05,
  device-verified in the test suburb).** Microsoft footprints have geometry but **no addresses**, so house numbers
  come from a SECOND overlay: **OpenAddresses** address POINTS → per-state `.pmtiles` (`-l address`, keep the
  `number` prop) → `address-overlays` GitHub release + `address-overlay-manifest.json` (`ADDRESS_MANIFEST_URL`,
  `-PaddressManifestUrl=`). **The bake DEDUPES per-unit/parcel repeats (2026-07-10, `scripts/dedup-addresses.py`):**
  OpenAddresses carries one row per unit/parcel, so a complex repeated its number all over its
  footprint on the map; the build keeps one point per (number, street, ~150 m cell). Takes
  effect per region on the next `address-overlays` workflow run (streamed tiles pick it up
  automatically; a LOCALLY DOWNLOADED overlay keeps the old points until re-downloaded).
  Data source = OpenAddresses batch API: `/api/data?source=us/<st>/statewide&layer=addresses`
  → its current `job` → `https://v2.openaddresses.io/batch-prod/job/<job>/source.geojson.gz` (GeoJSONL of Points
  with `number`/`street`; **42 US states have a `statewide` source**, the rest are county-only). Render:
  `VelaMapView`'s `LaunchedEffect(addressOverlays, …)` adds a `VectorSource` (the URI) + a **`SymbolLayer`**
  `setSourceLayer("address")`, `textField(get("number"))`, `textFont(["Noto Sans Regular"])`, size 10, grey +
  white halo, **minZoom 17 + stepped textOpacity (0 below z19, 1 at 19+)** - the visible behaviour is
  still numbers-only-at-the-~50-ft-view (17.5 carpeted whole blocks, user 2026-07-13), but the zoom gate
  CANNOT live in the layer's minZoom: the address archives carry tiles **only at z16-17**, and **MapLibre's
  pmtiles path never cold-fetches a tile clamped 2+ levels below the camera on a cold source** - minZoom 19
  meant a fresh launch that zoomed straight in fetched nothing, silently (`querySourceFeatures` = 0 forever),
  and it *looked* intermittent because tiles resident from a lower-zoom browse overzoom fine. The layer
  arms at 17 (being in zoom range is what drives tile fetching, even with the text invisible) and the 50 ft
  gate is the opacity step (found + fixed by alltechdev in the vela-dpad fork, ported 2026-07-13; issue #131).
  Residual edge: a session whose camera STARTS past ~z19 without ever dipping lower still fetches nothing - rare,
  the camera restores to browse zoom. NB the opacity-0 = invisible-to-queryRenderedFeatures gotcha (PR #125)
  doesn't bite here: below z19 the numbers were never tappable anyway - 
  inserted below `vela-controls` (see the LAYER ORDER warning below). **Streams online exactly like buildings**
  (`MapViewModel.refreshAddressOverlays(center)` on every camera-idle → the union of up to the 3
  smallest covering regions' `pmtiles://https://…` URIs - same spilled-bbox shadowing fix as the building
  overlay, see above; reuses `overlayStore.manifest()` which is manifest-URL-agnostic).
  **⚠️ LAYER ORDER (2026-07-06, device-verified fix):** the addr layers are inserted **BELOW `vela-controls`**
  (→ below the ambient POI icons), NOT `addLayer`/top - MapLibre places symbols TOPMOST-FIRST, so numbers
  stacked above the ambient layer grabbed collision boxes before the business icons placed and **EVICTED them
  at z16+** (the "Applebee's icon disappears on zoom-in" bug: reproduced on a big storefront building -
  prominence-scaled icons collide the most; small neighbours survived). Below the icons, numbers place last
  and yield - Google's behaviour. Also: while the overlay is active the basemap `vela-housenumber` layer is
  hidden (visibility NONE in the same LaunchedEffect) - both drew the SAME address at a slight offset
  (device-seen: the same number doubled at a slight offset). **NOT** the
  building overlay (different data + a Symbol not Fill layer + its own release/manifest). CI:
  `.github/workflows/address-overlays.yml` (clone of building-overlays), catalog `tools/address-regions.json`.
  **The house numbers fill the exact gap the basemap `vela-housenumber` (OSM `addr:housenumber`) leaves in new
  suburbs** - verified real house numbers in the test suburb rendered over the MS footprints.
- **Traffic lights + stop signs drawn on the map (`OverpassTrafficSignals.fetchControlsInBox` + `VelaMapView`,
  2026-07-05). + STATIC ROAD AIDS (2026-08-08, device-verified crossbuck at a Davis spur crossing):**
  `railway=level_crossing` (dark disc + white crossbuck X, RAILX_IMG) and `traffic_calming`
  bump/hump/table/cushion (amber disc + bump glyph, HUMP_IMG - only the shapes a driver FEELS;
  island/chicane/choker are lane geometry, excluded) ride the SAME pipeline: `TrafficControl.kind`
  (enum SIGNAL/STOP/RAIL_CROSSING/SPEED_HUMP, replaced the old stop boolean), one shared
  `controlSelectors()` in both the viewport-box and route-corridor queries, per-kind 30 m
  clustering, same layers/zoom gates/caps. Built as the buildable subset of "aids on the road"
  after every LIVE incident source proved dead (see ROADMAP: Google=binary vt tiles,
  Waze=reCAPTCHA-gated). OSM `highway=traffic_signals` (a stoplight icon) and `highway=stop` (a red STOP octagon) as a
  non-interactive `SymbolLayer` (`vela-controls`, icons `vela-signal`/`vela-stop`) drawn **beneath** the POI dots
  + pins, `minZoom 16`. **CLUSTERED PER INTERSECTION (2026-07-25):** OSM maps one control node per APPROACH (a
  four-way stop = four `highway=stop` nodes), so `refreshTrafficControls` merges same-type nodes
  within 30 m (`MapDeclutter.cluster`, the same radius the spoken pass-the-light counting uses)
  to their centroid before the cap - one drawn glyph per junction, like Google, and fewer
  allowOverlap symbols to render. **Icon sizing/visibility (2026-07-06, device-verified in downtown Davis):** `iconSize`
  is a zoom-interpolated expression (~0.75 at z15.5 → 1.05 at z17 → 1.5 at z19) - the flat 0.55 was too small to
  spot, especially tilted in nav; and `iconAllowOverlap(true)`+`iconIgnorePlacement(true)` so they ALWAYS draw
  (controls are sparse - one per junction - and the earlier collision-off-below-POIs was culling them away on the
  browse map, so the user couldn't see them; Google shows all of them at street zoom).
  **Z-ORDER (2026-07-09, device-verified downtown Davis):** the VISIBLE controls layer inserts at the very
  BOTTOM of the symbol stack (below the first basemap SymbolLayer), so a stop sign can never cover a street
  name, city label, or POI icon/text - they were stomping labels when the layer sat above the basemap. An
  INVISIBLE claim twin (`vela-controls-claim`, iconOpacity 0, allowOverlap true + ignorePlacement FALSE)
  stays at the old spot above the basemap labels: it places first and claims a collision box, so street
  names shift away from sign positions instead of printing on/next to one. Vela's own layers sit above the
  claim and place before it, so it can never evict a POI. Don't collapse the two layers back into one -
  draw order and placement order are the same thing in MapLibre, so "draws under labels" and "labels avoid
  it" genuinely need two layers. Data is keyless Overpass (sibling of the
  `fetchAlong` nav-landmark fetch + `OverpassPois`), fetched by `MapViewModel.refreshTrafficControls` from
  `onViewport` **only at z ≥ `CONTROLS_MIN_ZOOM` (16)**. Controls are STATIC, so it fetches a box padded 50%
  beyond the viewport and **reuses it while the center stays in the inner half** (`controlsBox`) - panning/driving
  through an area triggers no refetch, sparing the fair-use Overpass server; only nearing the box edge refetches
  (single-flight + 350 ms settle). The layer/updater are identity-gated like markers/ambient (`lastAppliedControls`)
  so a nav speedo tick doesn't re-tessellate them. No app setting (zoom-gated); no PMTiles/CI (live Overpass, unlike
  the building/address overlays). NB the `TRAFFIC_*` constants in `VelaMapView` are a DIFFERENT thing - Google's
  live-traffic raster overlay; the controls use `CONTROLS_*`. **DURING NAV the layer is fed by ONE
  ROUTE-CORRIDOR fetch per driven route instead (issue #248, 2026-08-08):** the moving camera crossed the
  cached box edge constantly, so the viewport path refetched over and over against sometimes-dead mirrors
  and the icons showed rarely / vanished quickly mid-drive. `refreshNavRouteControls` (hooked into the
  navSession observer at nav start + every reroute/faster-route swap, keyed on endpoints+length so a
  same-course stepsUpgrade/trafficUpgrade heal never refetches; skipped during hermetic replays) calls
  `OverpassTrafficSignals.fetchControlsAlongCorridor` - Overpass `around:` LINESTRING form, polyline
  sampled to ≤250 points to keep the GET URL mirror-safe, ~120 m corridor - then the same
  cluster-per-intersection pass, cap `CONTROLS_ROUTE_CAP` (800, nearest-to-start). While the corridor set
  is loaded, `refreshTrafficControls` returns early (it must neither refetch NOR run its z<16 clear
  branch, which would blank the layer at the 15.5 nav zoom floor); a FAILED corridor fetch leaves the
  key unset so the viewport path stays the fallback, and nav-end (`clearNavRouteControls`) nulls
  `controlsBox` so the next browse settle repaints. Needs a real-drive glance to confirm density/size feel.
- **Surveillance-camera (Flock / ALPR) layer (`OverpassAlprCameras` + `refreshFlock` + `FLOCK_LAYER`, device-verified
  2026-07-12).** Settings > Map > "Surveillance cameras" (`app.vela.ui.Flock` holder, **ON by default since 2026-07-13** -
  it's a headline feature and the bundled dataset makes it free to draw; `FlockRouteAlert` route-avoid stays
  OFF by default since it changes route choice) draws the
  community DeFlock project's `node["surveillance:type"="ALPR"]` OSM nodes as a purple camera badge, keyless via
  Overpass, sibling of the traffic-controls layer (per-viewport, area-cached `flockBox`, 350 ms settle, `FLOCK_MIN_ZOOM`
  **11** fetch AND layer minZoom **11** - route-overview visibility, re-landed 2026-07-13 now that the bundled
  dataset + stream-parse killed the giant-box OOM that reverted the first z11 try; keep the two gates IN LOCKSTEP,
  the 13 fetch / 13.5 layer era proved a fetch-without-draw dead band, vela-dpad issue #131). **TWO bugs found in device verification (both fixed):** (1) the Overpass `out`
  statement was `out tags`, which for a NODE returns id + tags but **omits lat/lon** - so `OverpassAlprCameras` parsed
  every element to null (no coords) and the layer was ALWAYS empty (this is why it "never drew"); fixed to `out body`
  (verified: Atlanta Ponce City Market went 0 -> 5 cameras, purple badges visible). (2) `Flock.init` was NOT called in
  `VelaApp.onCreate` (unlike `Traffic`/`TransitLayer`), so the persisted toggle read `false` on EVERY launch - the
  layer silently turned itself off after a restart; fixed by initialising it there. Real DeFlock nodes tag the vendor
  as `manufacturer` ("Flock Safety"), not `operator`, so the parser falls back to it. Coverage is OSM's - dense in US
  metros (Atlanta metro ~1571 nodes, a mid-size suburban metro ~200), sparse in a given ~1 km high-zoom box, so cameras show
  best around arterials at a neighbourhood zoom, not a quiet residential block. NB you can't browse to a far city and
  see them if free-drive-follow keeps recentering on your GPS - it fetches YOUR viewport (fine for the real use case:
  you driving through a covered area). **THIRD bug found 2026-07-13 (device): the fetch used a SINGLE hardcoded
  endpoint `overpass-api.de`, which regularly answers HTTP 504 "dispatcher" under load - so a fetch over a box that
  genuinely HAS cameras failed and the layer silently stayed empty, on BOTH the map AND the route-count path (both
  call `fetchInBox`).** Fixed with **`OverpassEndpoints`** (`core/data`): a shared endpoint list (primary +
  `kumi.systems` / `maps.mail.ru` / `private.coffee` mirrors) and a `run(http, query){ onBody }` failover runner
  that tries each endpoint in turn, uses the FIRST 2xx, and returns null only when EVERY endpoint fails. **All three
  keyless Overpass callers route through it** (`OverpassAlprCameras`, `OverpassTrafficSignals`, `OverpassPois`), so
  one overloaded instance no longer blanks flock cameras, stop signs/lights, or the offline OSM POI/address index.
  Proven: `overpass-api.de` was 504-ing while `maps.mail.ru` returned 16 Flock nodes over the same box.
  **Any NEW keyless Overpass fetch MUST go through `OverpassEndpoints.run`, never a bare hardcoded endpoint.**
  **BUNDLED + HOSTED on-device dataset (2026-07-13, supersedes the live Overpass path for cameras):** the
  whole global DeFlock set is tiny (~124k points), so it's baked into a gzipped TSV `lat<TAB>lon<TAB>operator<TAB>direction` (4th col = facing degrees since 2026-07-21, cardinals normalized at bake, empty untagged; the app decodes 3-col files too, and a facing CONE layer `vela-flock-dir` draws under the badge for tagged nodes)
  (~1.3 MB) by `scripts/build-flock-cameras.py` and queried on-device by **`app/data/FlockCameras`** (flat
  lat/lng arrays + a 0.1 deg grid index, parsed once off the main thread in `VelaApp`). Map layer draws
  INSTANTLY (no per-viewport network - the "why an API not a tile" report); route "passes N cameras" count
  is instant + RELIABLE (the live Overpass fan-out per tile was slow and often returned 0, so the avoid
  re-rank had no data). `refreshFlock`/`refreshFlockOnRoute` use `FlockCameras.inBox`/`.along` when
  `isLoaded`, falling back to `OverpassAlprCameras` only in the ~seconds before load (or if unreadable).
  **TWO tiers, newest wins BY VERSION, enforced in the loader (2026-07-23):** `ensureLoaded` compares the downloaded copy's version against the bundled floor's and loads the higher, deleting a download the bundled floor has passed - preferring any existing download served a pre-direction 3-column file over the newer 4-column bundled data, and the facing cones drew at launch (Overpass fallback) then vanished on the first viewport refresh. The tiers:  a **bundled floor** (`assets/flock_cameras.bin` + `assets/flock_cameras_version.txt`)
  so a fresh install has cameras instantly + offline; and a **hosted copy** on the `flock-cameras` INFRA
  release that `FlockCameras.refresh` downloads to `filesDir/flock/cameras.bin` when the manifest version
  beats what's on disk (`FLOCK_MANIFEST_URL`, `-PflockManifestUrl=` override) - so **camera data updates
  WITHOUT an app release** (the user's ask). CI **`.github/workflows/flock-cameras.yml`** (weekly Monday
  cron + dispatch) re-bakes + re-hosts the `.bin` + `flock-manifest.json`; version is a `YYYYMMDD` int
  (bundled floor = 20260713). **`.bin` NOT `.gz` on purpose:** aapt special-cases a `.gz` asset and silently
  un-gzips + renames it at build time (broke `open("...tsv.gz")`); a neutral extension is left intact and we
  gunzip it ourselves. Device-verified 2026-07-13: 124,406 loaded, purple badge drew with no network wait,
  route counts `[10,10,11]`, AND the hosted refresh downloaded a newer version (20260714) + hot-swapped +
  is idempotent on relaunch. **DRAWN badges cluster below street zoom (2026-07-25):** a Flock corner mounts several
  single-direction heads, so `vela-flock-cluster` (own source, 40 m `MapDeclutter` merge computed
  at upload time in VelaMapView) draws ONE badge per install from z11/13 up to z16, where the raw
  per-camera layer + facing cones take over; the browse-13/route-11 minZoom gate now lives on the
  cluster layer. Route camera COUNTS stay per-head on purpose. NB "avoid" still only RE-RANKS the alternates Google/OSRM offer (fewest-camera
  within a small detour); it does NOT graph-route around cameras. **To publish the first hosted copy, dispatch
  Actions -> "Flock cameras" once** (until then every install just uses the bundled floor).
- **Transitous is the PRIMARY departure-board source (2026-07-13, phase 1 of the GTFS adoption).**
  `core/data/transit/Transitous` talks to the community MOTIS instance at `api.transitous.org` - the
  open-GTFS + GTFS-Realtime aggregator (transit's FOSSGIS-OSRM: keyless, fair-use, identifying UA sent).
  `fetchStopDepartures` now calls `Transitous.board(lat,lng)` FIRST for any transit-category or
  Intersection place: `map/stops` finds the stop by PROXIMITY (no Google/OSM name correlation at all),
  and `stoptimes` on the nearest stop's PARENT station id returns EVERY route with realtime flags and
  the agency's own route colours - a hub's bays merge for free (device-verified: a corner that gave 1
  route via the Google blob shows 6 lines with official pill colours + live countdowns). The result maps
  into the SAME StopDepartures model, so the whole board UI renders unchanged. **Transitous boards
  REFRESH every 30 s while the sheet is open (2026-07-13):** `startBoardRefresh` re-queries the open
  feed on the countdown clock's cadence and swaps the board in place, self-cancelling the moment the
  selection changes; Google-fallback boards stay one-shot on purpose (a refresh there is a whole
  WebView load). The Google blob paths
  (fetchBoardFrom / resolveIntersectionStopBoard) remain the FALLBACK where Transitous lacks coverage.
  `buildBoard` is pure + unit-tested (TransitousTest). Remaining phase-2 candidate: transit
  directions via `/api/v1/plan` as a FALLBACK only - Google stays the primary transit router on
  purpose (its ETAs are traffic/history-aware; GTFS-RT only knows current lateness).
- **Canonical GTFS stops drawn on the map (2026-07-13, phase 2 of the Transitous adoption,
  device-verified).** At z >= 15 (`TRANSIT_STOPS_MIN_ZOOM`) the viewport's transit stops come from
  `Transitous.stopsInBox` (`map/stops`) and draw as a blue bus badge + stop-name label
  (`TRANSIT_STOPS_LAYER` in VelaMapView, sibling of the flock layer: area-cached box in the VM,
  350 ms settle, identity-gated source upload). One icon per STATION - bays dedupe onto their
  `parentId` in the VM, matching how the board queries the parent. **Tapping an icon opens the
  board DIRECTLY by stop id** (`onTransitStopTap` -> a lightweight `gtfs:<stopId>` place +
  `Transitous.boardFor` - zero Google resolution, zero name correlation; device-verified: tap ->
  named stop sheet + live board in one hop). **Wherever this layer has coverage the basemap's OSM
  bus icons hide** (applyData flips `poi_transit`'s filter to exclude class "bus", restoring the
  captured original filter when coverage goes - rail/airport stay basemap) so a stop can't draw
  twice at slightly different corners. **Offline floor = `app/data/TransitStopCache`**: every
  successful viewport fetch overwrites its area in a 24-area LRU JSON on disk, so the places a
  user actually visits keep fresh canonical stops with no extra machinery (the flock-dataset
  freshness property; global GTFS is too big to bundle, the visited-area cache is the
  equivalent). Offline/fetch-failure reads the covering cached area; a never-visited area falls
  back to the OSM basemap icons (filter restored). A fetch blip never blanks drawn stops.
  Regional GTFS stop packs (whole-state stops baked into the poi-pack pipeline) are the future
  hard-offline version - see task/ROADMAP.
- **Directional curb pairs merge into ONE icon (2026-07-13, device-verified).** US GTFS names both
  curbs of an intersection identically and carries NO direction field (verified against the raw
  `map/stops` JSON), so the map drew two overlapping same-named badges and each tap showed only
  half the departures. `Transitous.mergeDirectionalPairs` (same NAME within `PAIR_MERGE_M` = 160 m,
  proximity-clustered) collapses a pair to one representative at the pair's midpoint carrying the
  other ids in `MapStop.siblingIds`; the VM applies it after the parentId dedupe, and
  `TransitStopCache` persists `sib` so offline redraws keep the merge. `boardFor` (badge tap) and
  `board(lat,lng)` (proximity/Google-place path) merge stoptimes across representative + siblings,
  and `buildBoard`'s (route, headsign) grouping naturally shows both directions as separate rows.
  Direction-suffixed names (BRT-style "NB Station"/"SB Station") differ as strings so they never
  merge; geometry-based direction labels were rejected because the feed has no bearing data and
  street diagonals make guessing unreliable. Transit directions are untouched - they walk to the
  itinerary's exact boarding coordinate. Unit-tested (pair -> midpoint + sibling; same name across
  town stays separate; NB/SB stays separate).
- **Constrained / satellite networks (issue #235).** The manifest carries
  `PROPERTY_SATELLITE_DATA_OPTIMIZED` (value = the PACKAGE NAME, not a boolean - Android's docs
  are explicit; added 2901e0af 2026-08-04), which is what lets carriers who gate satellite service
  (Rogers/AT&T/KDDI) pass Vela's traffic at all. **The declaration is only half the contract** -
  Android requires a self-declared satellite-optimized app to ADAPT on such a link, which is the
  half added 2026-08-10: `app/ui/ConstrainedNetwork` reads `NET_CAPABILITY_NOT_BANDWIDTH_CONSTRAINED`
  (API 36) and `TRANSPORT_SATELLITE` (API 35) BY NAME through reflection - compileSdk is 35 and
  minSdk 26, so hardcoding either framework integer would be a guess that could silently mean
  something else on another release; absent constants yield null and the answer is false, because
  absence of the signal is not evidence of a constrained link. Detection rides the EXISTING
  `observeConnectivity` default-network callback (it already fires on capability changes, exactly
  when a handset falls back to satellite) -> `MapUiState.lowData` + the `:core` `LowDataMode.enabled`
  flag (same app-writes-a-core-flag seam as `LowRamMode`, which `:core` cannot read a holder for).
  What actually changes on a constrained link: the per-place PHOTO walk is skipped (the heaviest
  single transfer) and the ambient fan-out takes the LEAN path (8 terms at `!7i30` instead of
  15 at `!7i60`) - the same trade LowRamMode makes, for bytes rather than heap. NOT verifiable
  without a real satellite link; the plumbing is what was tested.
- **Nav smoothness trace (`app/diag/NavTrace`, Settings > Diagnostics, OFF by default, issue #251
  2026-08-10).** One row per nav frame - t, along-route progress, speed, bearing WINDOW, chordBrg,
  displayBearing, live camera bearing, frame dt - into a bounded 72k ring (oldest dropped), written
  to a CSV only on export. Recorded from the VelaMapView motion ticker, gated on the toggle so it
  costs nothing off. **It deliberately carries NO position data** (no lat/lng, no street, no
  wall-clock): every column is a bearing, an along-route distance, a speed or a timing, which is
  what separates the three jitter causes (frame drops vs route geometry vs fix cadence) while
  staying safe to attach to a public issue - unlike a recorded TRIP, which is raw GPS and must
  never be posted. Built because demo-drive measurements proved a bad proxy for real drives (the
  demo path had its own 3x clock bug, see the nav-camera notes).
- **Share diagnostics is functional now (2026-07-13):** `DiagLog` (opt-in breadcrumb ring, :core)
  PERSISTS to a bounded `filesDir/diag_log.jsonl` (appended per event, reloaded at init, deleted on
  opt-out) - it was in-memory only, and since the bug being reported usually killed or preceded a
  process restart, the export was empty essentially every time. `DiagExporter` SCRUBS the export:
  coordinate-looking decimals (3+ places) round to 2 (~1 km) so the JSON is safe to post publicly,
  with a header note saying so. Still no backend, still user-routed via the share sheet.
- **Public transit uses the same hidden WebView** (`app/web/WebDirectionsFetcher`).
  A plain `/maps/preview/directions` GET with the transit flag (`!3e3`) is silently
  downgraded to a *driving* reply (same TLS-fingerprint bot-detection as photos), so
  the WebView instead navigates the `/maps/dir/<olat>,<olng>/<dlat>,<dlng>/data=!4m2!4m1!3e3`
  page and reads the itinerary set out of `APP_INITIALIZATION_STATE`. **Depart/arrive time:** the
  board is time-dependent, so a scheduled request replaces the plain `!4m2!4m1!3e3` with Google's
  time block - `!4m6!4m5!2m3!6e{0=depart,1=arrive,2=last}!7e2!8j<unix-seconds>!3e3` (the `!4m` numbers
  are DESCENDANT counts, so the inner group grows `4m1`→`4m5` and the outer `4m2`→`4m6`; verified
  against a real Google transit-with-time URL - an earlier `!4m8!4m7` guess had the wrong counts and
  Google silently fell back to "now"). **Gotchas:**
  the directions payload is the **longest** `)]}'`-guarded string under slot `[3]`
  (a ~1.7 KB stub sits alongside the ~165 KB real one - take the longest, and poll
  for it: the SPA fills it a beat after page-finish). `TransitParser` (`:core`,
  takes the raw string so `:app` stays out of kotlinx.serialization, like
  `PhotosParser`) reads `root[0][1]` = trips, each trip's **summary at `trip[0]`**;
  `trip[1][0][1]` is the per-stop leg tree. Calibrated + device-verified Davis→Sacramento
  2026-06-18. **Full stop detail (2026-07-07, Miami→Aventura capture, unit-tested):** a RIDE
  leg carries its stop block at **`leg[5]`** - board `[5][0]`, alight `[5][1]`, **stop count
  `[5][2]`**, intermediate list `[5][7]` (each stop node: name `[0]`, agency code `[1]`, and
  time tuples - real-time arr/dep at `[2]`/`[3]`, timetable at `[7]`/`[8]`, so RT-vs-timetable
  epochs give "N min late"); **headsign `leg[0][14][2][1][0]`**, agency phone `leg[0][6][4][0][4]`,
  service alerts `leg[0][9][k][2]`. Fare is scanned defensively from the trip summary (usually
  absent - most US agencies send none). NB `parseLines` allows a **1-char** line name (single-digit
  bus routes like "9" are real; the old ≥2 guard dropped their pill). Each stop node's **coordinates
  are `[4][2]` (lat) / `[4][3]` (lng)** - `parseStopTime` reads them into `TransitStopTime.location`,
  and `assignWalkEndpoints` wires each WALK leg's `walkFrom`/`walkTo` from the adjacent ride's
  alight/board stop (falling back to the trip origin/dest, which `parse(raw, origin, dest)` threads
  through). The UI then fetches that walk leg's turn-by-turn steps **on demand** via the normal walk
  router (`MapViewModel.walkDirections` → OSRM foot) - no extra transit RPC. **The expanded
  itinerary DRAWS ON THE MAP (issue #233, 2026-08-08, device-verified):** expanding a chooser row
  sets `MapUiState.transitPreview` (`onTransitRowExpanded`; cleared on refetch, and collapsing only
  clears it if that row still owns it) -> `ensureTransitPreview` in VelaMapView draws ride legs as
  agency-coloured lines THROUGH the stops (board + intermediates + alight coordinates from the same
  payload; stop-to-stop chords - the keyless data carries no track geometry) with white stop dots on
  top (board/alight large, in-between small) and walk legs as dotted grey links, all inserted below
  the route line layer (empty in transit mode) so the drawing sits above roads + the satellite
  raster and below labels; a camera-fit branch (sibling of the route fit, keyed on coords + insets)
  frames the trip between the endpoints card and the chooser. MapScreen gates the param to the
  open, non-navigating TRANSIT chooser - OR to step-by-step transit nav (issue #232, 2026-08-08,
  device-verified): there the WHOLE guided itinerary draws and `transitNavLeg` (the guided leg's
  index) narrows the camera fit to THAT leg's coords, re-framing on every Next/auto-advance;
  `TransitNavSheet` became a BOTTOM PANE (48% height, rounded top, Street-View-pane grammar) so
  the map is actually visible during guidance - it was a full-screen Surface and the guidance
  read as a bare text list (the reporter's complaint); `cameraBottomInsetPx` has a transitNav
  case (0.48 screen) so the leg frames in the visible strip, `fabChromeOk` gained a transitNav
  gate (the P/locate FABs, scale bar and satellite attribution drew OVER the pane), and the
  top search-bar chrome hides during guidance too. **Step-by-step transit
  guidance** (Moovit-style, `TransitNavState` + `startTransitNav`/`advance`/`back`/`endTransitNav` in
  `MapViewModel`, `TransitNavSheet` in `PlaceSheet`) walks the itinerary leg by leg, speaking each
  cue (`transitStepSpoken` → the `transit_nav_*` strings; the walk cue's Google-abbreviated
  duration expands via `SpeechText.spokenEnUnits` — "10 min" was READ as the literal "min",
  user 2026-08-08; digit-anchored regexes + unit-tested so names like "M St" never rewrite;
  English guidance only, other locales keep their own hl= abbreviations) and auto-advancing when GPS reaches the leg
  end. The auto-advance is **latched** (`maybeAdvanceTransitNav`, `TRANSIT_ARM_M=90`/`TRANSIT_ARRIVE_M=40`):
  a leg only advances once it's been ARMED by being >ARM_M from its end, so a transfer hub can't cascade
  through legs and a short final walk can't fire a premature arrival.
- **Live stop departure board (`WebStopDeparturesFetcher` + `core/.../StopDeparturesParser`,
  2026-07-12, keyless + device-verified).** Tapping a transit STATION shows Google's "See departure
  board" in the place sheet. The board is embedded in the station's OWN place page's
  `APP_INITIALIZATION_STATE` (opening the button fires NO data RPC - only a gen_204 beacon) and
  SURVIVES a logged-out session (proven anonymous in Chrome + on-device; NOT login-gated like popular
  times), so it rides the SAME hidden-WebView `?cid=` channel as photos/reviews (desktop UA, anonymous)
  and reuses the longest-`)]}'`-string extract. **Schema (calibrated NYC subway hub 2026-07-12):**
  place `root[6]`, transit node `place[62]` = `["<station>", [ <groups> ]]`; group `[null,"<Subway
  services>", [ <lines> ], … "<mode>"]`; line `[null, [ <directions> ], … ftid]`; direction
  `["<headsign>", null,null, [ <departures> ]]`; a departure time tuple `[rtEpoch,"<tz>","4:35
  AM",offset,schedEpoch]` (realtime when rt≠sched); frequency `[<sec>,"20 min"]`. **TWO layouts
  (2026-07-12):** a station/subway groups entries by line -> direction -> departures (above), but a busy
  BUS stop lists every upcoming departure FLAT, each tagged with its own route pill at `entry[5][1]`
  shaped `["<label>", <int>, "#fill", "#text"]` (the same badge the itinerary line pills use). So the
  parser doesn't assume one shape: it reads the badge (route number + colours) + headsign + times off
  each entry and GROUPS by (route, direction) - the 25 separate "route 14" departures collapse into one
  "14" row with its next few times, in its line colour, and lines sort soonest-first. The container path
  is positional; the LEAF details (time tuples, frequency, the route badge) are matched by SHAPE, and
  `place[62]` is validated with a shape-search fallback - a moved leaf/field index degrades one line, not
  the board. `parse` returns **null** for a non-station (routine - most
  places have no transit node) and throws `CalibrationNeededException` only when a transit node yields
  0 lines. **Coverage is AGENCY-DEPENDENT** (only agencies that feed Google real-time embed it): NYC
  MTA + SF BART carry it, SacRT (small light rail) does NOT - `MapViewModel.fetchStopDepartures` is
  gated to transit-category places (`TRANSIT_CAT` regex) so it never fires on a business, and an empty
  result just shows no board. **INTERSECTION-named stops (2026-07-13):** a bus stop named by its corner
  ("Main St & 1st Ave" style) often resolves to Google's "Intersection" entity, whose OWN page has NO
  board (device-confirmed: the "some stops on a state-route corridor show no buses" report). `fetchStopDepartures` now, for an
  "Intersection" category, RE-RESOLVES to the co-located stop (`resolveIntersectionStopBoard`: search
  "<name> bus stop", take the nearest LIVE `TRANSIT_CAT` listing within **250 m**: a REAL co-located stop
  measured **89 m** from its junction point (device 2026-07-13) - just past the OLD 80 m cut, which is exactly
  why boards never showed at these corners; another junction's stops sit ~575 m out, so 250 m catches the
  right one only) and pulls ITS board onto the intersection sheet. No co-located Google
  listing (a rare OSM-only stop) -> no board, correctly. **The transit gate needs the EXCLUSION list too (2026-07-13):** "Gas station" /
  "Charging station" / "Fire station" all contain "station", and boards fetch by PROXIMITY now, so
  the fuel stop beside a bus stop showed that stop's departures (device report). `isTransitCategory`
  = gate word matches AND no NON_TRANSIT_CAT word does (fuel/EV/emergency/broadcast, localized);
  both regexes remote-overridable (`transitCategoryWords` / `transitExcludeWords`, calibration v17).
  v17 ALSO guards the shipped word list itself (lookbehind/lookahead on station/stazione/estaci/
  станц/תחנ) so pre-exclusion installs get the fix remotely - a unit test reads the REAL
  calibration.json and asserts the fuel/EV/emergency categories are rejected while every real
  transit category still matches (a broken edit fails CI, not the fleet). **The transit gates are MULTILINGUAL (issue #71, 2026-07-13):** categories arrive in the
  device language (hl=), so TRANSIT_CAT carries keyword stems for all 15 app languages - Hebrew was
  missing entirely, which made every stop tap in a Hebrew-locale install dead-end as a name-only
  sheet (the reporter's Jerusalem screenshot: no category match -> no live-stop pick -> no board,
  and a bare placeholder hugs its content so there's nothing to swipe to). And a HINTED tap (the
  basemap class says transit, language-independent) that resolves to NO Google stop listing now
  falls back to `Transitous.board` at the tapped coordinate directly - proximity only, no category,
  no feature id (the Google-page fallback is impossible without one anyway). Verified against live
  Transitous data at the reporter's exact stop (Israel MOT GTFS is in Transitous). **BOTH paths are name-first with a bare
  PROXIMITY fallback (2026-07-13):** OSM and Google often NAME the same stop differently ("A & B" vs
  "B & A", Hwy vs road name), so when the "<name> bus stop" search yields no live transit hit within
  250 m, a second location-biased query for just the mode word ("bus stop") runs and the nearest live
  listing wins (`nearestLiveStop` is the one shared predicate). **After-midnight departures carry a
  localized short-weekday marker** ("5:48 AM · Mon") via `departureDayLabel` in PlaceSheet - epoch vs
  now compared on the LOCAL calendar day, SimpleDateFormat("EEE") localizes free, no strings.xml.
  **TRANSIT HUBS are a keyless DATA LIMIT, not a parser bug (proven 2026-07-13 with a saved blob):**
  a major transit center's anonymous place page embedded exactly ONE route's departures (25 times,
  one headsign) - none of the other routes serving the hub appear ANYWHERE in the 156 KB payload
  (Google's app board comes from its first-party transit backend). The parser + grouping are correct.
  The follow-up design (task): a hub's BAYS each have their own Google listing ("<Hub> Bay A1"...)
  with their own boards - fetch the nearest few bay boards and MERGE them into the hub sheet. Fetch pinned `hl=en&gl=us` like `WebDirectionsFetcher` (12-hour clock
  the TIME regex reads). UI: `PlaceSheet.StopDepartureBoard` (one shared 30 s countdown clock, reuses
  `departsInLabel` + the `place_transit_*` strings + `place_departures`/`place_every`).
  **Departs-in countdown (2026-07-12):** `TransitBoard` runs ONE shared `produceState` clock (30 s
  tick) and each `TransitRow` shows a leading "Departing"/"in N min" from `departureEpochSec`
  (`departsInLabel`, hidden when >90 min out or already gone); the countdown reads GREEN with a
  "Live" dot when any leg carries real-time (`delayText` or a `boardStop.scheduledText` differing
  from the timetable), and the boarding leg's "N min late/early" is surfaced in the header. Pure
  render off already-parsed fields, no extra fetch. `delayText` is English-computed in `:core` (as
  in the drill-down); the countdown wrapper strings ARE localized (`place_transit_now`/`_in_min`/
  `_live`, invariable "min" abbreviation per locale like `place_delta_min`).
- **Tap-through route stop timeline (2026-07-12, keyless + device-verified).** Every `DepartureLineRow`
  on the board is `clickable` (a trailing `>` chevron hints it) -> `MapViewModel.openRouteDetail(line)`.
  There is NO new endpoint: the route's stop SEQUENCE is a lazy fetch NOT in the place blob, so this
  REUSES the proven transit-itinerary parser. `openRouteDetail` geocodes the line's headsign (biased to
  transit terminals - it prefers a candidate whose `category` matches station/airport/terminal/bart/…
  nearest the stop, because a bare "Richmond" resolves to a city district not the BART terminal), runs
  `webDirections.transit(stop, terminal)`, and among the ride legs picks the one on the tapped line
  (label match) else the leg whose `boardStop` is nearest the stop (the direction tapped) else the
  first - that `TransitStep` already carries `boardStop`/`intermediateStops`/`alightStop` with per-stop
  times. Rendered by `PlaceSheet.RouteDetailSheet` (full-screen `Surface`, `MapScreen` draws it over the
  place sheet when `state.routeDetail != null || routeDetailLoading`): a vertical rail in the line colour,
  board + alight bold, each `TransitStopTime` row `clickable` -> `openRouteStop(stop)` which
  `closeRouteDetail()` + `onPoiTap(stop.name, stop.location, "transit stop")` - so tapping a stop opens
  ITS board and the tap-through continues. **The transit KIND is load-bearing (fixed 2026-07-13):**
  without it `onPoiTap` searched the bare name, which Google resolves to the road JUNCTION, so
  tap-through threw you to a corner. `onPoiTap`'s pick is now TRANSIT-AWARE when a transit hint is set
  (map tap on a stop icon OR this tap-through): it takes the nearest LIVE `TRANSIT_CAT` listing within
  **250 m** (widened from 80 m 2026-07-13: the OSM icon and Google's stop listing routinely sit on different
  corners of the junction - a real pair measured 89 m apart; nearest-wins keeps the wide radius safe),
  EXCLUDES `permanentlyClosed`, and SKIPS the most-reviewed-canonical override (a defunct-but-
  reviewed old shelter was beating the live stop - the "tapped stop shows Permanently
  closed" device report). No live stop listing at the coordinate -> the lightweight name+location
  placeholder stays (a stop name beats an Intersection card; no board without a real stop listing, which
  is correct). Best-effort: an ungeocodable headsign / no ride leg flashes
  `route_detail_unavailable` (localized in all supported languages) and the overlay closes. State on `MapUiState`:
  `routeDetail: TransitStep?`, `routeDetailTitle`, `routeDetailLoading`, guarded by `routeDetailJob`.
  The board cap was raised 8 -> 24 lines (`StopDepartureBoard` + parser `MAX_LINES`) so busy stops show
  more routes. **Timeline rows are Google's treatment (2026-07-13):** taller rows with a hairline
  between stops (drawn INSIDE the row's bottom edge, inset 40dp past the rail - an item-level divider
  opens a visible gap in the connector line), call times in normal ink with the BOARDING stop's time
  a step bigger (titleMedium SemiBold), and a small status word under every time: dim "Scheduled"
  (`place_transit_scheduled`, all 15 locales) or green "Live" when the stop's realtime differs from
  its timetable (`scheduledText != timeText`). **The timeline's PRIMARY source is the GTFS trip itself
  (2026-07-13, device-verified):** Transitous boards stamp every departure with its `tripId`
  (`StopDeparture.tripId`), and `Transitous.tripStops` (`/api/v1/trip`) returns that run's REAL stop
  sequence - per-stop realtime vs timetable times AND per-stop/-run CANCELLED flags straight from the
  agency feed (`TransitStopTime.cancelled` renders a red "Cancelled" + struck-through time,
  `place_transit_cancelled` in all 15 locales). `buildTripStep` (pure, unit-tested) BOARDS at the tapped stop
  (nearest to the tapped coordinate; a terminus tap boards at the origin) and puts the stops the
  run already called at into `TransitStep.priorStops` - the sheet renders them GREYED above with a
  grey rail (the coloured rail starts at your stop, Google's treatment) and opens scrolled to the
  boarding stop (`rememberLazyListState(initialFirstVisibleItemIndex = priors)`). A moved time
  renders the timetable time struck through beside the live one - red when late, green when early
  or on time (`TransitStopTime.delayMin`, signed; the feed carries EARLY runs too, verified live). The headsign-geocode + itinerary-reuse path (`itineraryStep`) remains the FALLBACK for
  Google-fallback boards (their departures carry no tripId) and trip-fetch failures. NB transit
  DIRECTIONS still ride Google on purpose (traffic-aware ETAs) - this moved only the stops list.
  Boards still DROP fully-cancelled runs (`cancelled`/`tripCancelled`/`place.cancelled`); showing
  them struck-through on the board is an open option. **Device-verified: Powell St -> Yellow-S -> 11 stops (Powell…SFO, 12:23-12:54 PM), then
  tapping 16th St Mission opened that bus stop's own board.** **Per-line arrival depth raised 4 -> 8
  (2026-07-13, user report "only shows the next 4 or so arrivals"):** parser `MAX_TIMES` was 4, AND
  `DepartureLineRow` only rendered `upcoming.first()` + `drop(1).take(3)` = 4 total; both were the cap.
  Now `MAX_TIMES` = 8 and the trailing times render in a **`FlowRow`** so a busy stop's extra departures
  WRAP to more rows instead of overflowing the single Row (which is why they were capped at 3). **Superseded 2026-07-13: per-line depth is now a VERTICAL LIST of every embedded time** (parser `MAX_TIMES` = 30 ceiling; `DepartureLineRow` stacks the trailing departures one-per-row, each with its own "in N min" countdown, instead of the wrapping FlowRow). The board blob only carries the next several, so the list length is data-driven, not the cap. **Refined same day:** an agency can embed 25+ times and the
  full wall scrolled the route pill + headsign out of view (read as "the bus number is missing") - the
  list shows 5 + an "N more" expander (`place_transit_more_times`, all locales). Countdown past the hour
  reads hours+minutes via `formatDuration` ("in 1 h 6 min", `place_transit_in_duration`); after-midnight
  rows carry a localized short-weekday marker. **The TIME regex matches Unicode spaces explicitly**
  (`[\s\u00A0\u202F]`): some agencies put a NARROW NO-BREAK SPACE before AM/PM, which Android's ICU
  regex counts as `\s` but the JVM does NOT - unit tests silently diverged from device behaviour until
  a dumped blob exposed it. **Debug builds keep the last raw board payload** at `filesDir/depdump.txt`
  (WebStopDeparturesFetcher, BuildConfig.DEBUG only) - the schema is agency-shaped, so wrong-parse
  reports are only diagnosable from the actual blob. **The board renders FIRST in the sheet body**
  (above the address; renders nothing for non-transit places). **Badge matcher admits NAMED lines** (8-24
  chars when BOTH colours are hex - branded BRT lines carry a name, not a number; verified against
  a device blob). **Each row carries an explicit "Stops ›" action** (`place_transit_view_stops`, all
  locales) - the bare ripple wasn't discoverable as "tap to see the route's stops" (user 2026-07-13,
  overruling the earlier chevron removal in #168).
