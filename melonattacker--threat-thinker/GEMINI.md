# Threat Thinker Agent Guide

This document describes how human contributors and AI assistants should operate inside this repository. Follow it whenever crafting code, tests, docs, or analyses so that new work is aligned with the architecture, workflows, and security expectations of Threat Thinker.

## 1. Mission & Scope
- Automate threat modeling from system diagrams (Mermaid, draw.io, raster images) and produce concise reports referencing OWASP ASVS/CWE items.
- Provide CLI, Web UI, and API entry points, plus a local RAG layer for augmenting LLM reasoning with curated documents.
- Support Threat Dragon JSON round-trips and HTML/Markdown/JSON report surfaces for reviewers and automation.
- Favor small, reviewable pull requests that include documentation and automated tests relevant to the change.

## 2. Repository Map & Architecture
- `src/threat_thinker/`
  - `main.py`: CLI parser/subcommands (`think`, `diff`, `kb`, `webui`, `serve`, `worker`), orchestrates parsers → hint processor → LLM adapters → analyzers → exporters.
  - `cliui.py`: lightweight UI helpers and verbose logging toggles used by CLI and tests.
  - `webui.py`: Gradio-based UI wiring.
  - `parsers/`: diagram ingestion (`mermaid_parser.py`, `drawio_parser.py`, `threat_dragon_parser.py`, `image_parser.py`) plus helpers — keep deterministic and side-effect free.
  - `hint_processor.py`: merges user hints with LLM-generated attributes.
  - `llm/`: provider-specific adapters, prompt builders, throttling/retry logic (`providers/`, `client.py`, `inference.py`).
  - `threat_analyzer.py`: deduplicates/denoises threats, filters via thresholds, ensures ASVS references as requested.
  - `exporters.py`: Markdown/JSON/HTML exporters and diff helpers (`diff_reports`, `export_diff_md`), including Threat Dragon JSON round-trip support.
  - `rag/`: local KB management (`local.py`) for chunking, embedding, semantic retrieval.
  - `serve/`: FastAPI service entry (`api.py`) and infrastructure (`auth.py`, `ratelimit.py`, `jobstore.py`, `schemas.py`, `config.py`).
  - `worker/`: background analysis runner for the `serve` job queue.
  - `service/`: service-layer helpers that connect analyzers and adapters.
  - `models.py`, `constants.py`, `zone_utils.py`: shared dataclasses, enums, and zone utilities (keep type hints updated when contracts change).
- `tests/`: mirrors `src/` package structure with pytest suites, fixtures, and golden files; includes `tests/serve/` for API/worker behaviors.
- `docs/`: architecture notes, tutorials, and specs (keep rationale here, not operational findings).
- `examples/`: canonical diagrams (`.mmd`, `.xml`, `.png`) and sample reports under `examples/**/reports/`.
- `reports/`: generated analysis artifacts in Markdown/JSON/HTML; never hand-edit these.
- `benchmarking/`: notebooks/scripts for perf or accuracy comparisons.
- `examples/demo-app/`: sample service configuration and Docker Compose setup.
- Root configuration: `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`, `pytest.ini` (Ruff config lives in `pyproject.toml`).
- `dist/`: built artifacts; do not edit by hand.

## 3. Execution Modes & Entry Points
- **CLI**: `think`, `diff`, `kb` for local usage and automation.
- **Web UI**: `webui` launches Gradio (default `http://localhost:7860`).
- **API service**: `serve` runs a FastAPI server configured via YAML (`examples/demo-app/serve.example.yaml`).
- **Worker**: `worker` processes queued analysis jobs for the API service.

## 4. Development Workflow
1. **Environment**
   ```bash
   uv venv                         # create .venv if absent
   source .venv/bin/activate
   uv sync --extra dev
   uv sync --extra dev --frozen    # reproduce the reviewed dependency set
   ```
   Use `pip install -e .[dev]` as a fallback if `uv` is unavailable.
2. **Credentials**: export one or more of `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, or configure AWS credentials (`aws configure --profile ...` or `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID/...`) before running CLI/web UI/API features that contact LLMs.
3. **Iterate**
   - Run `ruff check src tests` and `ruff format` before committing.
   - Execute targeted pytest nodes during development (`pytest tests/parsers/test_mermaid_parser.py -k trust_boundary`) but always run `pytest` at the end.
   - When editing CLI flows, add fixtures to `tests/fixtures/` (e.g., diagrams, YAML hints) so regressions are reproducible offline.
4. **Artifacts**
   - CLI run:
     ```bash
     threat-thinker think \
         --mermaid examples/web/system.mmd \
         --infer-hints --topn 5 \
         --llm-api openai --llm-model gpt-4.1 \
         --format both \
         --out-md reports/web-report.md \
         --out-json reports/web-report.json
     ```
   - Diffing two reports:
     ```bash
     threat-thinker diff \
         --after reports/new-report.json \
         --before reports/old-report.json \
         --llm-api openai --llm-model gpt-4.1 \
         --out-md reports/diff.md --out-json reports/diff.json
     ```
   - RAG KB maintenance:
     ```bash
     threat-thinker kb build <kb_name> \
         --embedder openai:text-embedding-3-small \
         --chunk-tokens 800 --chunk-overlap 80
     threat-thinker kb search <kb_name> "lateral movement" --topk 5 --show
     threat-thinker think ... --rag --kb <kb_name> --rag-topk 8
     ```
   - Web UI launches via `threat-thinker webui` (Gradio on `http://localhost:7860`).
5. **Documentation & PRs**
   - Update `docs/` when interfaces, prompts, or architecture flows change.
   - Include CLI output screenshots or Markdown excerpts when UX is affected.
   - Commit messages stay short & imperative (`add kb search tests`, `fix drawio parser bounds`).

## 5. Coding Standards & Patterns
- Python 3.11+ with four-space indentation and full typing; prefer dataclasses for request/response payloads.
- Use descriptive `snake_case` for functions/variables and `PascalCase` for classes. Module docstrings summarize intent and key interactions.
- Keep prompt-building helpers pure – no file I/O or network calls in `llm/` prompt modules.
- Minimal but meaningful inline comments (e.g., explain unusual filtering logic or boundary conditions).
- Imports are auto-sorted by Ruff. Avoid wildcard imports.
- When adding new CLI options, update both `main.py` and README/tutorials for discoverability.
- Keep threat ranking logic deterministic: use sorted operations and explicit random seeds if randomness is unavoidable.
- Sanitize logs and outputs: never echo secrets, diagram contents, or user data unnecessarily; redact when in doubt.

## 6. Testing Expectations
- Align new tests under `tests/<package>/test_<module>.py`. Mirror class/function names to ease tracing.
- Favor small deterministic fixtures under `tests/fixtures/` or `examples/`. Store diagram snippets, hints YAML, and stub LLM responses there.
- Mock network/LLM calls; integration tests should rely on recorded outputs instead of live providers.
- When modifying exporters/analyzers, verify Markdown/JSON snapshots (e.g., load fixture report and assert on sections/keys rather than entire files).
- Always run `pytest` before opening a PR; document any intentionally skipped tests with reasons.
- If changing HTML or Threat Dragon outputs, add/update representative fixtures and assert on key sections/fields rather than entire documents.

## 7. Agent Behavior Guidelines
- **Understand before editing**: inspect relevant modules/tests prior to modification; summarize findings in PRs or assistant messages before proposing code.
- **Respect existing work**: never revert unrelated local changes. When encountering dirty files, coordinate with the author.
- **Safe command usage**: avoid destructive shell commands (`git reset --hard`, `rm -rf`, etc.) unless explicitly requested. Prefer `rg`, `pytest -k`, and targeted scripts.
- **Explain reasoning**: when proposing non-trivial code, provide rationale, risk assessment, and verification steps.
- **Validation first**: run local lint/tests whenever feasible; describe any gaps (e.g., network limits) so reviewers know what remains unverified.
- **Security & privacy**: never log or commit API keys, secrets, or sensitive diagram content. Generated threat reports belong in `reports/`, not `docs/`, unless sanitized for sharing.
- **CLI/Web/API parity**: when adding behavior to CLI flows, determine whether Web UI or API endpoints need matching controls and update `webui.py` or `serve/` as needed.
- **Snapshot sensitivity**: avoid making needless formatting/output changes that churn golden files unless they deliver clear value.

## 8. Tooling & Integrations
- **LLM Providers**: support `openai`, `anthropic`, `bedrock`, and local `ollama` (text-only). Ensure CLI defaults are sensible per provider (`llama3.1` for Ollama) unless the user specifies `--llm-model`. When adding providers/models, document credential requirements and update inference adapters; Ollama host defaults to `http://localhost:11434` (env `OLLAMA_HOST`).
- **Knowledge Base (RAG)**: data lives under `~/.threat-thinker/kb/<name>/{raw,chunks,index}` (see `rag/`). Guard against corrupt KBs by raising `KnowledgeBaseError`.
- **Export Surfaces**: Markdown/HTML outputs are reviewer-friendly; JSON feeds automation and diffing. Maintain schema stability: version keys in JSON and reflect changes in tests.
- **Threat Dragon**: import v2 JSON with `--threat-dragon` and export updated Threat Dragon JSON; keep layout metadata intact.
- **API Service**: configuration is YAML-driven (see `examples/demo-app/serve.example.yaml`), and the worker is required to process queued analysis jobs.
- **Docker**: `examples/demo-app/compose.yaml` and `examples/demo-app/.env` exist for service-oriented setups; keep secrets out of version control. The Dockerfile lives at `Dockerfile`.
- **Benchmarks**: store notebooks/scripts in `benchmarking/` and keep dependencies optional; document reproduction steps if numbers appear in README/docs.

## 9. Examples & Playbooks
- **Add parser support for a new diagram property**
  1. Extend parser module (`src/threat_thinker/parsers/...`) with deterministic extraction logic.
  2. Update relevant dataclasses in `models.py`.
  3. Adapt hint merging logic (`hint_processor.py`) to respect the new property.
  4. Write parser + analyzer tests plus an exporter snapshot if output changes.
  5. Document the property in README/tutorials.
- **Create a new RAG knowledge base**
  1. Place PDFs/Markdown in `~/.threat-thinker/kb/<kb_name>/raw/`.
  2. Run `threat-thinker kb build <kb_name> --embedder openai:text-embedding-3-small`.
  3. Validate with `threat-thinker kb search`.
  4. Reference it via `--rag --kb <kb_name> --rag-topk <n>` in CLI commands.
- **Threat Dragon round-trip**
  1. Import a Threat Dragon v2 JSON diagram with `--threat-dragon` or via Web UI upload.
  2. Run `think` with desired flags to enrich threats.
  3. Export Threat Dragon JSON alongside Markdown/JSON/HTML; verify positions/metadata remain unchanged.
  4. Re-open the exported JSON in Threat Dragon to validate rendered cells and embedded threats.
- **Compare two threat runs**
  1. Collect JSON outputs for both versions.
  2. Run `threat-thinker diff --after ... --before ... --out-md ... --out-json ...`.
  3. Review Markdown diff for narrative, JSON for automation/regression detection.
- **Add or change API/worker behavior**
  1. Update `serve/` schemas or handlers and keep `service/` helpers deterministic.
  2. Extend `worker/` only for queue-driven analysis logic.
  3. Add tests under `tests/serve/` and update docs if request/response shapes change.

## 10. Anti-Patterns & Failure Modes
- Skipping lint/tests before submitting (CI will fail and wastes reviewer time).
- Bypassing hint merging/denoising layers and sending raw diagram data directly to LLM adapters.
- Adding prompts or export templates with hidden coupling (e.g., referencing non-existent fields) without corresponding tests.
- Hardcoding provider credentials or embedding sample API keys anywhere in the repo.
- Generating reports or fixtures outside repo boundaries; tests need deterministic, versioned assets inside `tests/fixtures/` or `examples/`.
