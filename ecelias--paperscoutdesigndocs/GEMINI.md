# Repository Instructions for AI Coding Agents

This file guides AI agents that create or modify the PaperScout.ai codebase.
PaperScout.ai is a web application that sends daily or weekly updates about
recent literature in a user's research field, summarizes selected articles with
AI, and teaches young researchers how search strategies work.

Before doing any work in this repository, read these files in full when they
exist:

1. `README.md`
2. `PLANNING.md`, `PAPERSCOUT.md`, or the project planning Markdown document
3. `LICENSE`
4. `CODING_STANDARDS.md`
5. `DEVELOPER.md`
6. `QUICKSTART.md`
7. `docs/architecture/` documents
8. `docs/api/` documents
9. `docs/user-guides/` documents

The project planning document is the product source of truth. It defines the
mission, license, functional requirements, non-functional requirements,
technology choices, planned units, testing expectations, and integration tests.

`AGENTS.md` is the execution source of truth for AI agents. It defines how an
agent should plan, scope, implement, test, and document changes.

When instructions conflict, use this order of authority:

1. Explicit user request for the current ticket.
2. This `AGENTS.md` file.
3. `CODING_STANDARDS.md`, if present.
4. The PaperScout.ai planning document.
5. `README.md` and `DEVELOPER.md`.
6. Existing code patterns.

Never remove the project license or copyright notices.

## Project Mission

PaperScout.ai helps young researchers stay current with recently published
literature. The system must:

1. Let users register, log in, and manage their profiles securely.
2. Let users create, edit, delete, and review literature search queries.
3. Retrieve relevant articles from PubMed and arXiv.
4. Select the most relevant articles based on search terms, preferences, and
   feedback.
5. Generate concise, readable AI summaries for selected articles.
6. Send scheduled updates by the user's selected delivery method.
7. Store search history and returned article metadata.
8. Ask for optional feedback on result relevance and summary usefulness.
9. Use feedback to improve future search strategies and summarization.
10. Show the search strategy used for each update so users can learn.

The product is for users who may be new to literature search. Favor clear
interfaces, obvious workflows, simple language, and helpful explanations over
feature density.

---

## License Requirements

PaperScout.ai is licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 or
later.

All agents must:

1. Preserve AGPL license text and notices.
2. Avoid adding dependencies with licenses that conflict with AGPL-3.0-or-later.
3. Prefer open-source libraries and frameworks.
4. Document any dependency license concerns in the implementation plan.
5. Never replace the license without explicit approval.

---

## Core Technology Stack

Use the stack defined in the planning document unless an approved plan says
otherwise.

### Frontend

1. JavaScript.
2. React.
3. CSS.
4. Jest.
5. React Testing Library.
6. Cypress for browser-level end-to-end tests.

### Backend

1. Python.
2. FastAPI.

Agents may add conventional application subdirectories inside the unit folders
when useful, but must keep the unit mapping obvious.

## Unit Boundaries

A unit means different things depending on category.

### Frontend Units

A frontend unit is a full page or major page component. Examples:

1. Landing page.
2. About app page.
3. About developer page.
4. Sign-up page.
5. Login page.
6. User dashboard.
7. User profile.
8. Search history page.
9. New query page.
10. Previous search page.

Each frontend unit must include:

1. UI component code.
2. Routing behavior when applicable.
3. Form validation when applicable.
4. Loading and error states when data is fetched.
5. Accessibility behavior.
6. Unit tests.

### Backend Units

A backend unit is usually a class, service, route group, or workflow. Examples:

1. User login.
2. User sign-up.
3. Dashboard display.
4. New query handling.
5. Profile management.
6. Admin capabilities.

Each backend unit must include:

1. Clear request and response models.
2. Validation behavior.
3. Service-level domain logic.
4. Explicit error handling.
5. Tests for normal, edge, and failure cases.

### AI, Messaging, and Database Units

AI, messaging, and database units are granular functions or adapters because
these areas carry reliability, privacy, and security risk.

Examples:

1. PubMed request builder.
2. arXiv response parser.
3. Article relevance selector.
4. Summary generator.
5. Update formatter.
6. Password hasher.
7. Create user record.
8. Update scheduler record.
9. Create feedback record.
10. Send email notification.

Keep I/O adapters separate from pure domain transformations.

41. Create Search History Item.
42. Create Feedback Item.

If a requested feature spans multiple units, state that clearly in the plan and
implement only the approved slice.

---

## Engineering Principles

All code must be:

1. Composable.
2. Testable.
3. Small in scope.
4. Secure by default.
5. Explicit about validation and error handling.
6. Deterministic wherever practical.
7. Accessible in user-facing areas.
8. Clear enough for humans and AI agents to reason about.
9. Aligned with the documented unit boundaries.
10. Limited to the approved ticket scope.

Prefer pure functions for domain logic.

Use immutable data structures where practical.

Avoid hidden mutation, mutable global state, implicit side effects, and
unreviewed background work.

Isolate side effects behind clearly named boundary functions. Side effects
include:

1. Network access.
2. Database reads and writes.
3. Filesystem access.
4. Email and SMS delivery.
5. Scheduler execution.
6. AI model calls.
7. Time-dependent behavior.
8. Randomness.
9. Authentication token generation.

Pass time, randomness, and configuration into functions when deterministic
testing would otherwise be difficult.

Do not use `assert` for runtime argument validation. Use explicit exceptions
such as `ValueError`, `TypeError`, or precise domain exceptions.

Catch specific exceptions. Avoid bare `except:`. Avoid catching `Exception`
unless re-raising as a precise domain exception with useful context.

---

## Ticket-Based Workflow

Treat every requested feature, bug fix, refactor, documentation update, test
change, dependency update, or configuration change as a single JIRA-style
ticket.

Work on only one chunk of functionality at a time.

Before writing code, produce a numbered implementation plan for review.
Stop after producing the plan. Do not write code until the plan is approved.

The plan must include:

1. Task summary.
2. Units affected.
3. Functional requirements.
4. Non-functional requirements.
5. Acceptance criteria.
6. Files expected to change.
7. New or modified functions, modules, classes, components, routes, or types.
8. Database schema or migration changes.
9. External services touched.
10. Security and privacy considerations.
11. Test strategy.
12. Documentation updates.
13. Dependency/version research.
14. Docker or Docker Compose build/run plan.
15. Edge cases and assumptions.
16. Explicitly out-of-scope items.

If requirements are ambiguous, document the assumption in the plan.

---

## After Plan Approval

Once the plan is approved:

1. Implement only what the approved plan describes.
2. Do not introduce unrelated refactors.
3. Do not introduce unapproved dependencies.
4. Do not alter public behavior outside the approved scope.
5. Do not silently expand database schema.
6. Do not silently add external API calls.
7. Add or update tests for all behavior changes.
8. Update documentation only when required by the approved scope.
9. Preserve documented unit boundaries.
10. Preserve the approved scope exactly.

If implementation reveals that the approved plan is incomplete, stop and ask
for approval to revise the plan.

---

## Version Control Workflow

Use the branch model from the planning document.

1. `main` contains only production-ready code.
2. `develop` is the feature-integration branch.
3. Feature branches branch from `develop`.
4. Bug branches branch from `develop`.
5. Rebase feature and bug branches onto `develop` regularly.
6. Use pull requests for merges into `develop`.
7. Use pull requests for releases from `develop` into `main`.
8. Require passing automated tests before merge.

Use Semantic Versioning in `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` format:

1. Increment `MAJOR` for incompatible API changes.
2. Increment `MINOR` for backward-compatible functionality.
3. Increment `PATCH` for backward-compatible bug fixes.

---

## Python Style Requirements

Follow `CODING_STANDARDS.md` when present. Default expectations:

1. Use `from __future__ import annotations` where useful.
2. Use full package imports where practical.
3. Avoid wildcard imports.
4. Group imports in this order:
   1. Future imports.
   2. Standard library.
   3. Third-party packages.
   4. Local modules.
5. Use modern type annotations such as `str | None`, `list[int]`, and
   `dict[str, str]`.
6. Prefer `Sequence`, `Mapping`, and other abstract collection types for input
   parameters when appropriate.
7. Use `TypeAlias` for type aliases.
8. Use descriptive type variables such as `_ArticleT`.
9. Avoid mutable default arguments.
10. Keep functions small and focused.
11. Prefer refactoring functions that grow beyond roughly 40 lines.
12. Use one statement per line.
13. Use four-space indentation.
14. Limit lines to 88 characters unless a documented exception applies.
15. Use two blank lines between top-level definitions.
16. Use one blank line between methods.
17. Use f-strings or logging parameter interpolation appropriately.
18. For logging, call logging functions with a pattern string and parameters,
    not f-strings.
19. Use context managers for files, sockets, database sessions, and other
    stateful resources.
20. Place executable script logic in `main()`.
21. Guard executable scripts with:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    raise SystemExit(main())
```

---

## FastAPI Requirements

Backend APIs must be designed around clear contracts.

1. Use Pydantic models for request bodies, query parameters where useful, and
   response payloads.
2. Validate user input at API boundaries.
3. Keep route handlers thin.
4. Put business logic in services.
5. Put database access in repositories or clearly named data-access modules.
6. Use dependency injection for database sessions, authenticated users,
   settings, and external clients.
7. Return appropriate HTTP status codes.
8. Avoid leaking internal exception details to users.
9. Log operational errors without exposing secrets or private user data.
10. Document endpoints in `docs/api/` when behavior changes.

---

## React Requirements

Frontend code must be simple, accessible, and easy to test.

1. Use React components with clear prop names.
2. Use controlled inputs for forms.
3. Validate forms before submitting.
4. Display useful loading, empty, success, and error states.
5. Keep data fetching separate from pure presentational components when
   practical.
6. Use React Testing Library to test user-observable behavior.
7. Use semantic HTML before custom widgets.
8. Add accessible labels to inputs and buttons.
9. Make keyboard navigation work for interactive elements.
10. Avoid exposing implementation details in tests.

Naming conventions:

1. React components use `PascalCase`.
2. Hooks use `useCamelCase`.
3. Utility functions use `camelCase` in JavaScript.
4. Routes should be clear and stable, such as `/login`, `/signup`,
   `/dashboard`, `/profile`, `/queries/new`, and `/search-history`.

---

## Functional-Programming Requirements

Prefer functional-programming style for domain logic.

Pure functions must:

1. Return the same result for the same inputs.
2. Avoid mutating caller-owned arguments.
3. Avoid reading or writing hidden global state.
4. Avoid I/O.
5. Avoid network calls.
6. Avoid filesystem calls.
7. Avoid database access.
8. Avoid time-dependent behavior unless time is passed in explicitly.
9. Avoid random behavior unless randomness is passed in explicitly.
10. Return new values instead of mutating existing values.

When side effects are required, isolate them in boundary functions and test them
with mocks or controlled fixtures.

Prefer dispatch tables over long `if`/`elif` chains when mapping keys to
operations.

Avoid clever, overly dense, or hard-to-debug functional code.

---

## Docstrings With Acceptance Criteria

For pure functions, service functions, validation functions, adapters, and
public APIs, include docstrings with explicit acceptance criteria.

Use this structure where applicable:

```python
def normalize_search_terms(raw_terms: list[str]) -> list[str]:
    """Return normalized search terms for literature retrieval.

    Acceptance criteria:
        1. Determinism: Same input returns the same ordered output.
        2. No mutation: Do not mutate caller-owned lists.
        3. Validation: Empty normalized terms raise `ValueError`.
        4. Normalization: Terms are stripped and empty entries are removed.
        5. Deduplication: Duplicate terms are removed case-insensitively.

    Args:
        raw_terms: User-provided search terms.

    Returns:
        Normalized search terms.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If no usable terms remain after normalization.
    """
```

Acceptance criteria must be specific, testable, and aligned with the approved
plan.

---

## Database Requirements

Database code must protect user data and preserve relationships between users,
queries, schedules, results, and feedback.

Required logical tables or equivalent models include:

1. Users.

2. Check license compatibility with AGPL-3.0-or-later.
3. Explain why the dependency is needed.
4. Document the selected version.
5. Include the change in the implementation plan.
6. Wait for approval before changing dependency files.

Do not add dependencies for convenience when standard-library or existing
project tools are sufficient.

---

## Docker Requirements

Use Docker or Docker Compose as the primary build and run workflow once the
codebase is bootstrapped.

Do not rely on local host execution as the only documented workflow.

Default expectations:

1. Backend Docker image uses an approved Python base image.
2. Frontend Docker image uses an approved Node base image.
3. PostgreSQL runs as a Docker Compose service for integration testing.
4. Environment variables are passed through Compose, not hard-coded.

1. User behavior.
2. Developer workflow.
3. Commands.
4. Flags.
5. Parameters.
6. Setup steps.
7. Docker usage.
8. Docker Compose usage.
9. Dependency versions.
10. Project structure.
11. Database schema.
12. API endpoints.
13. Scheduler behavior.
14. AI behavior.
15. Search strategy transparency.
16. Notification behavior.
17. Security behavior.

Do not update unrelated documentation.

## Definition of Done

A ticket is done only when:

1. The approved scope is implemented.
2. Unit boundaries remain clear.
3. Tests are added or updated.
4. Tests pass in the documented workflow.
5. New behavior is documented when required.
6. External services are mocked in tests.
7. Security and privacy risks are addressed.
8. Accessibility requirements are addressed for user-facing changes.
9. Error handling and fallback behavior are tested.
10. No unrelated refactors are included.
11. No unapproved dependencies are introduced.
12. No secrets are committed.
13. The final response summarizes changed files, tests run, and any known
    limitations.

---

## Scope Control

Do not:

1. Write code before plan approval.
2. Implement functionality outside the approved plan.
3. Refactor unrelated code.
4. Add unapproved dependencies.
5. Change public behavior outside the approved scope.
6. Introduce hidden global state.
7. Add mutable module-level state unless explicitly approved.
8. Store plaintext passwords.
9. Log secrets or sensitive user data.
10. Skip tests for behavior changes.
11. Call live external services in unit tests.
12. Replace FastAPI with another backend framework without approval.
13. Replace React with another frontend framework without approval.
14. Change the license without approval.
15. Hide AI-generated query expansion or summary behavior from users.

## Role Expectation

Act like a senior software engineer building a secure educational research
product.

Be precise, conservative in scope, and quality-focused.

Favor clear, maintainable, well-tested code over clever implementations.

When uncertain, document the assumption in the plan before implementing.

Never expand scope silently.
