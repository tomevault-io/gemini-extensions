# Manifesto Agent Guide

> **Scope:** Guide for developers using Claude Code agents to work with Manifesto.

**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Operational Guide
**Audience:** Human developers using Claude Code agents

---

## Document Purpose

This guide is for developers using Claude Code agents to work with the Manifesto codebase. It differs from `CLAUDE.md` in the following ways:

| Document | Audience | Purpose | Tone |
|----------|----------|---------|------|
| **CLAUDE.md** | LLM agents writing code | Constitutional constraints (binding) | Normative, restrictive |
| **AGENTS.md** | Developers using agents | Practical agent usage guide (advisory) | Educational, practical |

**When to read CLAUDE.md:** If you are an LLM agent modifying Manifesto code (this is automatically loaded).

**When to read AGENTS.md:** If you are a developer using Claude Code agents to work with Manifesto.

## Tooling Setup

If you want Codex to load Manifesto-specific guidance in another project:

1. Install `@manifesto-ai/skills` as a dev dependency
2. Run `npm exec manifesto-skills install-codex` or `pnpm exec manifesto-skills install-codex`
3. Restart Codex

This setup is explicit. `@manifesto-ai/skills` does not auto-register itself from `postinstall`.
For the full walkthrough, see the external `@manifesto-ai/skills` package README.

**Current contract note:** The canonical Snapshot block below reflects the current Core v4.0.0 contract. Accumulated `system.errors` and `appendErrors` are no longer part of the current Snapshot/SystemDelta surface.

---

## Quick Reference: Constitutional Constraints

For developers using agents, here's a condensed reference to the key constraints from `CLAUDE.md`. Agents will automatically follow these rules.

**Version:** 1.0 (based on CLAUDE.md)

### 0. Document Identity

The Constitution (`CLAUDE.md`) is a **binding operational constitution** for any LLM that interacts with the Manifesto codebase.

This is NOT documentation. This is NOT a tutorial. This is a **constraint specification**.

**Who it applies to:**
- Any LLM writing new code
- Any LLM refactoring existing code
- Any LLM adding features
- Any LLM modifying architecture

**Why violating it invalidates changes:**
Changes that violate this constitution produce systems that are NOT Manifesto-compliant. Partial compliance is not recognized. A system violating any single axiom, sovereignty rule, or forbidden pattern is NOT Manifesto.

**Normative hierarchy:**
1. Constitution (highest authority)
2. SPEC documents
3. FDR documents
4. Code
5. README (lowest authority)

When documents conflict, prefer higher-ranked sources.

**Commit and PR discipline:**
- If an agent creates or rewrites commits, each commit subject must use Conventional Commit format: `type(scope): summary` or `type: summary`.
- If an agent opens or updates a pull request, the pull request title must also use Conventional Commit format: `type(scope): summary` or `type: summary`.
- Allowed types are the repository-enforced set: `build`, `chore`, `ci`, `deps`, `docs`, `feat`, `fix`, `perf`, `refactor`, `revert`, `style`, `test`.
- Treat non-conforming commit subjects as invalid output, not as a style preference, because CI rejects them and release automation relies on them.
- Treat non-conforming pull request titles as invalid output, not as a style preference, because CI rejects them at the pull request gate.

---

### 1. Core Engineering Axiom

**Manifesto computes what the Snapshot should become; Host makes declared work real.**

The fundamental equation is:

```
compute(schema, snapshot, intent) -> (snapshot', requirements, trace)
```

This equation is:
- **Pure**: Same inputs MUST always produce same outputs
- **Total**: MUST always return a result (never throws)
- **Traceable**: Every step MUST be recorded
- **Complete**: Snapshot MUST be the whole truth

---

### 2. Engineering Priorities (Ordered)

When priorities conflict, higher-ranked priorities MUST prevail.

1. **Determinism** — Same input MUST produce same output, always
2. **Accountability** — Every state change MUST be traceable to Actor + Authority + Intent
3. **Explainability** — Every value MUST answer "why?"
4. **Separation of Concerns** — Core computes, Host executes, SDK exposes runtime, Lineage records continuity, Governance authorizes legitimacy
5. **Immutability** — Snapshots and Lineage Worlds MUST NOT mutate after creation
6. **Schema-first** — All semantics MUST be expressible as JSON-serializable data
7. **Type safety** — Zero string paths in user-facing APIs
8. **Simplicity** — Minimum complexity for current requirements only

**Never trade a higher priority for a lower one.** Convenience, performance optimization, and developer preference are NOT valid reasons to violate determinism or accountability.

---

### 3. Package Boundary Rules

---

### 4. State & Data Flow Rules

#### 4.1 Snapshot Structure (Canonical)

```typescript
type Snapshot = {
  data: Record<string, unknown>;     // Domain state
  computed: Record<string, unknown>; // Derived values (recalculated, never stored)
  system: {
    status: 'idle' | 'computing' | 'pending' | 'error';
    lastError: ErrorValue | null;
    pendingRequirements: readonly Requirement[];
    currentAction: string | null;
  };
  input: unknown;                    // Transient action input
  meta: {
    version: number;                 // Monotonically increasing
    timestamp: number;               // Host-provided logical time
    randomSeed: string;              // Host-provided deterministic seed
    schemaHash: string;              // Schema hash this snapshot conforms to
  };
};
```

#### 4.2 State Mutation Rules

**ONLY THREE PATCH OPERATIONS EXIST:**
1. `set` — Replace value at path (create if missing)
2. `unset` — Remove property at path
3. `merge` — Shallow merge at path

**FORBIDDEN:**
- In-place mutation of Snapshot
- Direct property assignment
- Array push/pop/splice (use `set` with expression)
- Deep merge (use multiple patches)

**ALL state changes MUST:**
- Go through `apply(schema, snapshot, patches)`
- Result in a new Snapshot (old Snapshot unchanged)
- Increment `meta.version` by exactly 1

#### 4.3 Computed Values

- Computed values are ALWAYS recalculated, NEVER stored
- Computed dependencies form a DAG (cycles are rejected)
- Computed expressions MUST be pure (no side effects)
- Computed MUST be total (always return a value, never throw)

#### 4.4 Data Flow Direction

```
Actor submits typed Intent
      |
      v
SDK runtime
      |
      v
Host (compute loop + effect execution)
      |
      v
Core (pure computation)
      |
      v
New Snapshot (via patches)
```

Governed composition adds explicit legitimacy and continuity around the same runtime path:

```text
Actor proposes typed Intent
      |
      v
Governance (proposal + authority decision)
      |
      v
SDK runtime -> Host -> Core -> terminal Snapshot
      |
      v
Lineage (sealed immutable World record)
```

**CRITICAL:** Information flows ONLY through Snapshot. There are no other channels.

---

### 5. Failure Model

#### 5.1 Errors Are Values

Errors are **values in Snapshot**, NOT exceptions.

```typescript
type ErrorValue = {
  code: string;
  message: string;
  source: { actionId: string; nodePath: string };
  timestamp: number;
  context?: Record<string, unknown>;
};
```

#### 5.2 FORBIDDEN Failure Patterns

- `throw` in Core logic (Core is pure, never throws)
- `try/catch` for business logic errors
- Boolean success flags (`{ success: boolean, data?: T }`)
- Implicit error channels
- Swallowed errors

#### 5.3 REQUIRED Failure Patterns

- Effect handlers MUST return `Patch[]`, never throw
- Failures MUST be expressed as `SystemDelta` transitions to `system.lastError` or as patches to domain state
- Flow failures use `{ kind: 'fail', code: string, message?: string }`
- Host MUST report effect execution failures faithfully through Snapshot

#### 5.4 Error Handling Pattern

```typescript
// Effect handler - CORRECT
async function handler(type, params): Promise<Patch[]> {
  try {
    const result = await api.call(params);
    return [{ op: 'set', path: 'data.result', value: result }];
  } catch (error) {
    return [
      { op: 'set', path: 'data.syncStatus', value: 'error' },
      { op: 'set', path: 'data.errorMessage', value: error.message },
    ];
  }
}

// Flow - CORRECT
{ kind: 'fail', code: 'VALIDATION_ERROR', message: 'Title required' }
```

---

### 6. Type Discipline

#### 6.1 Zero String Paths

User-facing APIs MUST NOT require string paths.

```typescript
// FORBIDDEN
{ path: '/data/todos/0/completed' }

// REQUIRED
state.todos[0].completed  // TypeScript-checked FieldRef
```

#### 6.2 Phantom Types for References

```typescript
type FieldRef<T> = {
  readonly __kind: 'FieldRef';
  readonly path: string;
  readonly _type?: T;  // Phantom type
};

type ComputedRef<T> = {
  readonly __kind: 'ComputedRef';
  readonly path: string;
  readonly _type?: T;
};
```

#### 6.3 Type Safety Requirements

- All state field access MUST support IDE autocomplete via Zod inference
- Type mismatch MUST fail at compile time where possible
- Generated schemas MUST be JSON-serializable
- Expression results MUST be typed

#### 6.4 FORBIDDEN Type Shortcuts

- `any` in public APIs
- `as` casts to bypass type checks
- `@ts-ignore` without explicit justification
- String literal types where FieldRef should be used

---

### 7. File & Module Structure Rules

#### 7.1 File Size

- Files SHOULD NOT exceed 500 lines
- Files exceeding 300 lines SHOULD be evaluated for decomposition
- Single-responsibility principle: one concept per file

#### 7.2 Export Rules

- Public API exports MUST go through package `index.ts`
- Internal modules MUST NOT be imported directly from outside package
- Types and implementations MUST be co-located or explicitly separated

#### 7.3 Naming Conventions

| Kind | Convention | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| Package | kebab-case | `@manifesto-ai/core` |
| File | kebab-case | `snapshot-adapter.ts` |
| Type | PascalCase | `DomainSchema` |
| Function | camelCase | `computeResult` |
| Constant | SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE | `MAX_RETRIES` |

#### 7.4 Test File Location

- Tests MUST be in `__tests__/` directories
- Test files MUST be named `*.test.ts` or `*.spec.ts`
- Test helpers MUST be in `__tests__/helpers/`

---

### 8. Refactoring Rules

#### 8.1 Valid Refactoring Motivations

- Reducing cyclomatic complexity
- Improving type safety
- Fixing constitutional violations
- Removing dead code
- Extracting reusable patterns that already appear 3+ times

#### 8.2 INVALID Refactoring Motivations

- "Cleaner" code (subjective)
- Future requirements not yet specified
- Personal style preferences
- Performance optimization without profiling evidence
- Making code "more flexible" for hypotheticals

#### 8.3 Refactoring Constraints

- MUST NOT change public API signatures without explicit request
- MUST NOT introduce new dependencies
- MUST NOT change constitutional boundaries
- MUST maintain all existing test assertions
- MUST NOT add features disguised as refactoring

#### 8.4 Before Refactoring

- Read the file first
- Understand existing patterns
- Verify tests pass before changes
- Verify tests pass after changes

---

### 9. Testing Philosophy

#### 9.1 What Tests Prove

- **Core tests:** Determinism (same input -> same output)
- **Host tests:** Effect handler correctness, patch application
- **Lineage/Governance tests:** continuity invariants, sealed World record integrity, legitimacy settlement
- **Integration tests:** End-to-end flow correctness

#### 9.2 Core Testing (No Mocks)

Core is pure. Tests require NO mocking.

```typescript
// CORRECT - Core test
it('computes transition', () => {
  const result = core.compute(schema, snapshot, intent);
  expect(result.snapshot.data.count).toBe(1);
});
```

#### 9.3 FORBIDDEN Test Patterns

- Mocking Core internals
- Time-dependent assertions in Core tests
- Tests that depend on execution order of unrelated tests
- Tests that modify global state
- Tests that require network access

#### 9.4 REQUIRED Test Patterns

- Effect handlers tested with explicit return values
- Determinism tests: run same input twice, assert identical output
- Boundary tests: verify layer doesn't import forbidden dependencies
- Invariant tests: verify constitutional axioms hold

---

### 10. Anti-Patterns (Explicit Examples)

#### 10.1 Intelligent Host (FORBIDDEN)

```typescript
// FORBIDDEN - Host making decisions
async function executeEffect(req) {
  if (shouldSkipEffect(req)) {  // Host deciding!
    return [];
  }
  // ...
}

// Host MUST execute or report failure, never decide
```

#### 10.2 Direct State Mutation (FORBIDDEN)

```typescript
// FORBIDDEN
snapshot.data.count = 5;
snapshot.meta.version++;

// REQUIRED
const newSnapshot = core.apply(schema, snapshot, [
  { op: 'set', path: 'data.count', value: 5 }
]);
```

#### 10.3 Value Passing Outside Snapshot (FORBIDDEN)

```typescript
// FORBIDDEN - Returning value from effect
const result = await executeEffect();
core.compute(schema, snapshot, { ...intent, result });

// REQUIRED - Effect writes to Snapshot
// Effect handler returns patches, Host applies them
// Next compute() reads result from Snapshot
```

#### 10.4 Execution-Aware Core (FORBIDDEN)

```typescript
// FORBIDDEN - Core branching on execution state
if (effectExecutionSucceeded) {  // Core cannot know this
  // ...
}

// REQUIRED - Core reads from Snapshot
if (snapshot.data.syncStatus === 'success') {
  // ...
}
```

#### 10.5 Re-Entry Unsafe Flow (FORBIDDEN)

```typescript
// FORBIDDEN - Runs every compute cycle
flow.seq(
  flow.patch(state.count).set(expr.add(state.count, 1)),  // Increments forever!
  flow.effect('api.submit', {})  // Called multiple times!
)

// REQUIRED - State-guarded
flow.onceNull(state.submittedAt, ({ patch, effect }) => {
  patch(state.submittedAt).set(expr.input('timestamp'));
  effect('api.submit', {});
});
```

#### 10.6 Authority Bypass (FORBIDDEN)

```typescript
// FORBIDDEN - Direct execution when governance is required
host.execute(snapshot, intent);  // Bypasses Governance and Lineage!

// REQUIRED - Governed intents enter through the governed runtime
const proposal = await governed.proposeAsync(intent);
await governed.approve(proposal.proposalId);
// Governance authorizes, Host executes through the SDK runtime, Lineage seals the terminal Snapshot
```

#### 10.7 Hidden Continuation State (FORBIDDEN)

```typescript
// FORBIDDEN - Execution context stored outside Snapshot
const pendingCallbacks = new Map();  // Hidden state!

// REQUIRED - All execution state in Snapshot
// snapshot.system.pendingRequirements
```

#### 10.8 Turing-Complete Flow (FORBIDDEN)

```typescript
// FORBIDDEN - Unbounded loops in Flow
{ kind: 'while', condition: expr, body: flow }  // Does not exist

// REQUIRED - Host controls iteration
while (snapshot.system.pendingRequirements.length > 0) {
  // Host loop, not Flow
}
```

#### 10.9 Circular Computed Dependencies (FORBIDDEN)

```typescript
// FORBIDDEN
computed.define({
  a: expr.get(computed.b),  // a depends on b
  b: expr.get(computed.a),  // b depends on a - CYCLE!
});
```

---

### 11. LLM Self-Check

Before producing any code change, mentally verify ALL of the following:

#### Constitutional Compliance

- [ ] Does this change preserve determinism? (Same input -> same output)
- [ ] Does this change maintain Snapshot as sole communication medium?
- [ ] Does this change respect sovereignty boundaries? (Core computes, Host executes, SDK exposes runtime, Lineage records continuity, Governance authorizes)
- [ ] Are all state changes expressed as Patches?
- [ ] Are all errors expressed as values, not exceptions?

#### Package Boundaries

- [ ] Does this code import only from allowed packages?
- [ ] Does this code NOT import forbidden dependencies?
- [ ] Is this code in the correct package for its responsibility?

#### Flow Safety

- [ ] Are all Flow patches state-guarded for re-entry safety?
- [ ] Are all Flow effects state-guarded for re-entry safety?
- [ ] Does this Flow terminate in finite steps?
- [ ] Are there no circular `call` references?

#### Type Safety

- [ ] Are there zero string paths in user-facing APIs?
- [ ] Are all public APIs properly typed (no `any`)?
- [ ] Do types compile without `@ts-ignore`?

#### Testing

- [ ] Can Core changes be tested without mocks?
- [ ] Do tests verify determinism where applicable?
- [ ] Are all existing tests still passing?

#### Simplicity

- [ ] Is this the minimum complexity needed for the current requirement?
- [ ] Are there no features added beyond what was requested?
- [ ] Are there no premature abstractions?
- [ ] Are there no hypothetical future requirements addressed?

#### Before Submitting

- [ ] Have I read the files I'm modifying?
- [ ] Have I run the relevant tests?
- [ ] Does this change align with existing patterns in the codebase?
- [ ] Would this change be accepted by the Constitution?

### 12. Canonical Statements

Reference these when making decisions:

| Statement | Source |
|-----------|--------|
| "Core computes. Host executes. These concerns never mix." | FDR-001 |
| "If it's not in Snapshot, it doesn't exist." | FDR-002 |
| "There is no suspended execution context. All continuity is expressed through Snapshot." | FDR-003 |
| "Core declares requirements. Host fulfills them. Core never executes IO." | FDR-004 |
| "Errors are values. They live in Snapshot. They never throw." | FDR-005 |
| "Flows always terminate. Unbounded iteration is Host's responsibility." | FDR-006 |
| "If you need a value, read it from Snapshot. There is no other place." | FDR-007 |
| "Same meaning, same hash. Always." | FDR-010 |
| "Computed values flow downward. They never cycle back." | FDR-011 |
| "Three operations are enough. Complexity is composed, not built-in." | FDR-012 |

---

### 13. Quick Reference Tables

#### Sovereignty Matrix

| Role | May Do | MUST NOT Do |
|------|--------|-------------|
| **Actor** | Propose change | Mutate state, execute effects, govern |
| **Authority** | Approve, reject, constrain scope | Execute, compute, apply patches, rewrite Intent |
| **SDK** | Expose activated runtime, typed intents, projected reads, reports | Compute semantics, execute effects directly, own governance/lineage internals |
| **Lineage** | Seal continuity, maintain World records, restore, branch/head history | Execute effects, evaluate authority, apply patches directly |
| **Governance** | Govern legitimacy, evaluate authority, record decisions | Execute effects, seal lineage implicitly, compute state transitions |
| **Core** | Compute meaning, declare effects | IO, execution, time-awareness |
| **Host** | Execute effects, apply patches, report | Decide, interpret, suppress effects |

#### Forbidden Import Matrix

| Package | MUST NOT Import |
|---------|-----------------|
| core | host, sdk runtime internals, lineage, governance |
| host | governance policy, lineage internals, React, authority handlers |
| sdk | core internals, host internals, lineage internals, governance internals |
| lineage | host internals, core compute internals, governance policy internals |
| governance | host internals, core compute internals, lineage storage internals |
| app | core internals, host internals, sdk internals, lineage internals, governance internals |

#### Priority Decision Tree

```
Is determinism preserved?
├── No → REJECT change
└── Yes → Is accountability maintained?
    ├── No → REJECT change
    └── Yes → Is separation of concerns respected?
        ├── No → REJECT change
        └── Yes → Is Snapshot the sole medium?
            ├── No → REJECT change
            └── Yes → ACCEPT change (apply remaining checks)
```

## Working with Claude Code Agents

This section provides guidance for developers using Claude Code agents to work with the Manifesto codebase.

### Understanding Claude Code Agent Roles

Claude Code provides specialized agents for different tasks:

| Agent Type | Purpose | When to Use |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| **General Agent** | Code generation, debugging, refactoring | Standard development tasks |
| **Documentation Agent** | Writing/updating docs, generating API references | Documentation work |
| **Task Agent** | Multi-step task execution with tool invocation | Complex workflows requiring multiple tools |

### Using the manifesto-docs-architect Agent

The `manifesto-docs-architect` agent is a custom-configured agent designed specifically for Manifesto documentation work. It:

- Enforces the six-layer documentation hierarchy (Orientation → Concepts → Architecture → Specs → Guides → FDR)
- Prevents category errors in documentation (e.g., calling Manifesto a "workflow engine")
- Generates Mermaid diagrams that are architecturally accurate
- Cross-references Constitution, SPEC, and FDR documents appropriately

**Example: Generating API Documentation**

```bash
# Using manifesto-docs-architect to document a new API
claude-code --agent manifesto-docs-architect \
  "Document the new withLab() API in packages/lab/docs/GUIDE.md"
```

The agent will:
1. Read the code to derive accurate API information
2. Check existing SPEC/FDR for normative definitions
3. Structure content according to layer requirements
4. Add "What this is NOT" sections if needed
5. Generate Mermaid diagrams for architecture clarity

### When to Use the Task Tool

The Task tool is ideal for open-ended work requiring multiple rounds of exploration:

**Use Task tool when:**
- You need to explore the codebase structure before making changes
- The work requires multiple grep/glob passes to find all relevant files
- You're unsure which files need modification
- The task involves coordinating changes across multiple packages

**Example scenarios:**
```typescript
// Scenario 1: Finding all uses of a deprecated pattern
Task: "Find all Flow definitions that are not re-entry safe and list them"

// Scenario 2: Architecture documentation requiring code exploration
Task: "Document the data flow between Core and Host, using actual code examples"

// Scenario 3: Cross-package refactoring
Task: "Update all Effect handler signatures to use the new ErrorValue type"
```

**Do NOT use Task tool when:**
- The file paths are already known
- The change is localized to a single file
- The work is straightforward code modification

### Agent Communication Best Practices

When working with Claude Code agents on Manifesto:

1. **Reference the Constitution explicitly**
   - Good: "Update this Flow following Constitution Axiom 3 (Patch Exclusivity)"
   - Bad: "Make this Flow better"

2. **Specify the documentation layer**
   - Good: "Add this to Layer 4 (Specifications)"
   - Bad: "Add this to the docs"

3. **Clarify mental model expectations**
   - Good: "Explain governed composition by separating Governance legitimacy from Lineage continuity"
   - Bad: "Explain the old governed layer"

4. **Request architectural verification**
   - Good: "Generate a sequence diagram showing Actor -> Governance -> SDK/Host -> Lineage flow"
   - Bad: "Show how this works"

### Common Agent Pitfalls (and How to Avoid Them)

| Pitfall | Why It Happens | How to Prevent |
|---------|----------------|----------------|
| Agent suggests `any` in public APIs | Convenience over type safety | Remind: "Use strict TypeScript, no `any` in public APIs" |
| Agent creates circular dependencies | Lack of package boundary awareness | Reference: "Check Section 3 (Package Boundary Rules)" |
| Agent uses string paths in examples | Common pattern in other frameworks | Specify: "Use FieldRef, zero string paths (CLAUDE.md Section 6)" |
| Agent adds future-oriented features | Trying to be helpful | Clarify: "Only implement current requirements (Priority 8: Simplicity)" |

### Example: Full Agent Workflow

**Task:** Add a new Authority type to @manifesto-ai/governance

**Step 1: Verify constitutional compliance**
```bash
claude-code "Show me where Authority types are defined and confirm \
  they don't execute effects or apply patches (Constitution Section II)"
```

**Step 2: Implement with boundaries enforced**
```bash
claude-code "Add a new DurationAuthority that rejects Intents older than N seconds. \
  Follow Authority Sovereignty rules. Must NOT execute, compute, or apply patches."
```

**Step 3: Document the change**
```bash
claude-code --agent manifesto-docs-architect \
  "Document DurationAuthority in packages/governance/docs/governance-SPEC.md (Layer 4)"
```

**Step 4: Update tests**
```bash
claude-code "Add tests verifying DurationAuthority respects Authority Sovereignty. \
  Follow Section 9.4 (REQUIRED Test Patterns)"
```

### Agent Self-Check Prompts

Before finalizing agent-generated code, ask the agent to verify:

```
Review this change against CLAUDE.md Section 11 (LLM Self-Check):
- Does it preserve determinism?
- Does it maintain Snapshot as sole medium?
- Are all state changes expressed as Patches?
- Are package boundaries respected?
- Is this the minimum complexity needed?
```

### Getting Help from Agents

**For conceptual questions:**
```bash
claude-code "Explain the difference between Effect and Requirement, \
  using definitions from packages/core/docs/SPEC.md"
```

**For pattern identification:**
```bash
claude-code "Find examples of re-entry safe Flows in apps/example-todo"
```

**For debugging:**
```bash
claude-code "Why is this Flow being executed multiple times? \
  Check against Section 10.5 (Re-Entry Unsafe Flow)"
```

---

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Should I always use CLAUDE.md when working with agents?

A: No. Use CLAUDE.md as a reference for constraints, but use AGENTS.md for practical guidance. If the agent is modifying code, it should follow CLAUDE.md. If you're asking questions or exploring, AGENTS.md is sufficient.

### Q: Can I ask agents to "simplify" the Constitution?

A: No. The Constitution is intentionally restrictive. Simplifying it would violate architectural integrity. Instead, ask agents to explain specific sections with examples.

### Q: What if an agent suggests violating the Constitution?

A: Reject the suggestion and reference the specific section being violated. Example: "This violates Axiom 2 (Snapshot as Sole Medium). Please revise using only Snapshot for communication."

### Q: How do I know if agent-generated documentation is correct?

A: Verify it against the normative hierarchy:
1. Does it contradict CONSTITUTION.md?
2. Does it contradict SPEC documents?
3. Does it match the actual code?

If yes to any, the documentation is incorrect.
