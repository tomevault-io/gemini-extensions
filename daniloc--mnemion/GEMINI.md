## Current state

Deploys as a single Cloudflare Worker that exposes MCP at `/mcp`. Cross-surface data sharing proven (Claude Code + Claude.ai reading/writing the same store).

### Architecture

Two Durable Objects:
- **SessionDO** (`McpAgent`) — one per MCP session, handles protocol, proxies to hive via RPC
- **HiveDO** — one per user, holds all SQLite data. Keyed by `user:{userId}` (currently always `"owner"`)

HiveDO is a thin wiring shell. Domain logic lives in pure-function modules with `db`/context injected:
- **`data.ts`** — query, mutate, search (DataContext)
- **`evolution.ts`** — schema evolution via `CHANGE_TYPES` declaration table (EvolutionContext)
- **`credentials.ts`** — passkey + token operations (db)
- **`kernel.ts`** — pre-mutation hooks, immutable fields, scope matching
- **`schema.ts`** — DDL, migrations, kernel table declarations, audit triggers

### Auth

Layered auth behind OAuth 2.1. The `workers-oauth-provider` package wraps the worker and handles the OAuth flow (DCR, tokens).

- **Master secret** (`MNEMION_SECRET`): High-entropy random hex, set via `npm run setup`. Root of trust — used to bootstrap the owner passkey and as fallback for headless agents. The user's Cloudflare login is the true credential; the secret is ephemeral and replaceable. Master-secret logins resolve to the `owner` actor.
- **Passkey** (WebAuthn): Optional convenience layer for browser-based OAuth. Registered via one-time setup URL. Stored in HiveDO `_passkeys` table — **one credential per member** (re-registering a member replaces only that member's row). If any passkey is registered, `/authorize` shows passkey-first UI with secret fallback. Authentication offers all members' credentials and resolves the actor from the one used.
- **Access tokens** (`_access_tokens`): Scoped bearer tokens for remote agents, uploads, marketplace, and federated access. Created via `mutate`. Scope matching is hierarchical prefix-based. Optional `member` column attributes a token to a member; the OAuth external-token path resolves the session's actor from it (member-less → `owner` sentinel; suspended/archived member → refused).
- **No secret configured** = dev mode (auto-approves).

### Shared hive (multi-member)

One hive, several people. Hive identity (which Durable Object) is decoupled from actor identity (which person): `HIVE_ID` (`src/constants.ts`, literal `"user:owner"` — a rename for clarity, not a re-key) names the single store every member authenticates into; the authenticated member's label rides in the OAuth session props as `actor`, separate from `hiveId`. Design doc: `project-docs/active/shared-hive.md`.

- **Members** (`_members` kernel pattern): the roster. `label` (immutable handle, the join key for passkeys/tokens), `display_name`, `role` (`owner`|`member`), `status` (`active`|`suspended`). The `owner` member is seeded on boot and reserved. Creating a member is consent-gated at the MCP layer (it grants standing access to the whole hive).
- **Invite flow**: (1) create the `_members` row with `label` + `display_name` (the inviting agent names them); (2) mint a `register`-scoped access token with `member: "<label>"` (forced single-use; the hook refuses `owner` and any non-active-roster member); (3) the token is minted **inert** — an existing member must approve it in person at `/invite/{token}` via passkey (master-secret fallback) before it works; (4) once approved, give the invitee its `/setup?token=...` URL, where they register their own passkey, bound to that member. The setup endpoints accept either the master secret (owner bootstrap) or an **approved** `register` token (invitee). The passkey approval — not the agent-satisfiable mutate round-trip — is the real human-consent gate: `approved_at` is IMMUTABLE on the mutate path and set only by the approval endpoint, so an agent acting on injected content can mint an invite but never activate it.
- **Revocation**: suspend (`status: suspended`) or archive a member → their passkey logins and tokens stop resolving; also archive their `_access_tokens` rows. The global session epoch (`/sessions/revoke`) remains the all-at-once panic button.
- **Attribution** (per-entry `created_by`/`updated_by`): every write stamps the session actor onto the entry. `created_by`/`updated_by` are kernel columns (auto-provided on every pattern, like `created_at`; not facets), set by the mutate engine from the actor — MCP writes from the session props (`session.ts`), browser writes from the session cookie (which now carries the member, backward-compatibly), internal/ingress writes default to the `owner` sentinel. Caller-supplied `created_by`/`updated_by` are stripped (`executeMutate`) so attribution can't be forged. Surfaced automatically in `query`/`resolve`/prime row reads.

### Vocabulary

Mnemion uses biological vocabulary at every layer — API parameters, URIs, JSON response keys, and docs: **hive** (the whole store), **pattern** (organizing structure), **entry** (instance within a pattern), **facet** (dimension of an entry), **link** (connection between entries). Internal SQL tables (`_objects`, `_fields`) keep implementation names but are never exposed to agents.

### Resources (stable, cacheable, subscribable)

- `mnemion://index` — master index
- `mnemion://schema/{pattern_name}` — facet definitions for a pattern
- `mnemion://history` — schema evolution history (supports `?limit=N`)
- `mnemion://entry/{pattern}/{id}` — individual entry by URI
- `mnemion://stale` — entries past their staleness horizon (supports `?days=N`); review surface for maintenance passes

### Tools (7 total)

Tool metadata is centralized in `src/tools.ts` (SSOT for `session.ts` MCP registration + `/api/tools` frontend):

- `prime` — auto-associative recall: pass conversational context, get semantically-nearest entries + one-hop links. Workers AI embeds entries on write, Vectorize indexes them, prime queries KNN. Relevance is weighted at read time: superseded entries demoted ×0.3 + annotated `superseded_by`; patterns with a memory-policy half-life decay by `0.5^(age/half_life)` where age runs from the later of `updated_at` and the last prime hit (`_entry_access_log` — recall is rehearsal). `raw_similarity` is kept alongside weighted `relevance`. A `maintenance` field appears when a cleanup pass is overdue.
- `resolve` — read anything by `mnemion://` URI, including federated cross-hive URIs and `mnemion://web/<https-url>` for adapter-cached web fetches (escape hatch for platforms without resource support)
- `query` — filtered, sorted, paginated reads (supports `count_only` mode). Filter operators: `= != > < >= <= ~` (LIKE) and `|=` (IN, comma-separated values — e.g. `id|=1,3,7` for batched multi-id lookups)
- `search` — cross-pattern full-text search across text facets
- `mutate` — create, update, or archive entries. Single creates in user patterns run a policy-gated write-time conflict check (synchronous embed + KNN ≥0.80 same-pattern; the vector is reused for the post-write upsert) and return `possible_overlap` advisories; exclusive-facet duplicates advise via cheap SQL (batch included). Advisory only — never blocks.
- `propose_change` — propose schema evolution (preview, no commit)
- `apply_change` — commit proposed change (fires resource update notifications)

### HTTP I/O & Federation

Agent-defined HTTP endpoints, configured as entries:
- **Shared entries** (`_shared`): `GET /o/entry/{pattern}/{id}` — serve entries marked public or unlisted
- **Egress** (`_outputs`): `GET /o/{path}` — serve agent-constructed content at arbitrary paths
- **Documents** (`_documents`): R2-backed file store. `_documents` entry holds agent metadata (title/description/tags/visibility) + system-managed blob bookkeeping (`r2_key`/`size`/`content_type`/`stored_at`, IMMUTABLE); bytes live in R2 (`DOCUMENTS` binding), never the hive. Two-step: `mutate _documents create` auto-mints a single-use `document`-scoped token and returns `upload_url`; `POST /f/{token}` streams to R2 (≤25 MB) and records the key. Served at `GET /f/{id}`, visibility-gated like `_shared` (private 404 / unlisted token `read:document:{id}` / public edge-cached). Archiving the entry deletes the R2 object (waitUntil). Non-private visibility is consent-gated (visibility-aware, like set_sharing). R2 key is fully random (non-enumerable). On upload, text is extracted into `extracted_text` (text-family inline via `src/extract.ts`; PDF via `unpdf` in `ctx.waitUntil`) and the entry re-embedded, so document contents are searchable (`search`) and recallable (`prime` — `_documents` is in prime's KERNEL_INCLUDE); `extraction_status` reports done/pending/failed/unsupported. Chunked embeddings for long docs are a future seam.
- **Publications** (`_publications`): `GET /p/{path}` — live pattern projections rendered at request time (never stored). Formats: html (default styles + owner `css` override), rss, json, markdown (YAML frontmatter). Source query reuses the data.ts query engine (filters/facets/sort/limit pass through); superseded entries excluded by default. Per-entry `template` seam: `{{facet}}` + `{{_label}}`/`{{_uri}}`/`{{_id}}`/`{{_updated_at}}` — template text raw, substituted values HTML-escaped in html/rss. Source must be a user pattern (kernel patterns never publishable). Creation is consent-gated at the MCP layer like `_shared`. ETag = max(publication, served entries) `updated_at`; public responses edge-cached 60s.
- **Ingress** (`_inputs`): `POST /i/{path}` — accept inbound data, create entries in target patterns with optional transform DSL

**Federation**: `resolve` recognizes foreign URIs by a dot in the first path segment (hostname). `mnemion://other.hive.dev/entry/axioms/7` → `GET https://other.hive.dev/o/entry/axioms/7`. Private access via `?token=<auth_code>` → Bearer header. Public responses edge-cached. No federation protocol — sovereign hives, voluntary connections.

Federation is gated by a consent allow-list (`_federation_hosts` kernel pattern): `resolve` refuses any cross-hive URI — and never sends a token — unless the target host has an active entry there. Loopback/private/link-local/internal hosts (incl. cloud metadata) are blocked outright and can't be allow-listed (`isBlockedFederationHost` in kernel.ts). Adding a host is consent-gated at the MCP `mutate` layer (confirmation round-trip, also blocked inside batches), so an agent acting on untrusted content can't silently leak the owner's token to an attacker host.

### Memory maintenance (contradiction management + decay)

All read-time-derived, owner-ratified, never auto-deleting:

- **Supersession**: a `supersedes`-labeled `_links` row (source supersedes target). Prime demotes + annotates; entry resolution and the stale view annotate `superseded_by`. Entries are never hidden.
- **Memory policy**: `memory_policy` JSON column on `_objects` (beside `doctrine`), set via the `set_memory_policy` change type. Shape: `{half_life_days?: number|null, conflict_check?: "annotate"|"off", exclusive_facets?: string[]}`. Defaults when unset: conflict check on, decay off. Surfaced per-pattern in the index. Kernel patterns can't carry policy.
- **Decay**: `decayMultiplier` in prime.ts — `max(0.05, 0.5^(age/half_life))`, ranking only, never data. `_entry_access_log` records prime hits on user-pattern entries.
- **Stale view**: `mnemion://stale` — per-pattern horizon of 3× half-life (90 days without a policy).
- **Maintenance passes**: `_maintenance_passes` kernel pattern. Days-since derived from the latest row; interval from charter key `maintenance_interval_days` (default 14). Overdue status injected into MCP init instructions (session.ts) AND the prime response (web clients never see init instructions).
- Agent protocol lives in `src/system-docs/memory-maintenance.md`.

### Entry sharing

Entry-level visibility via the `_shared` kernel pattern. Controlled through `propose_change` with `set_sharing` type:
- **public** — openly readable at `/o/entry/{pattern}/{id}`, edge-cached
- **unlisted** — readable with valid access token (anyone-with-the-link)
- **private** — not served (default; removes sharing)

### Access tokens

Unified `_access_tokens` kernel pattern (replaced `_auth_codes`, `_upload_tokens`, `_marketplace_tokens`). Hierarchical scope matching via `scopeMatches()` (kernel.ts, re-exported by credentials.ts):
- `*` — full access (OAuth, session login, all reads/writes)
- `read` — read any shared entry or output (matches `read:entry:axioms:7`)
- `upload` — write via `/upload/{token}` (constraints JSON: `{target_pattern, target_id, target_facet, mode}`)
- `marketplace` — private marketplace git access (constraints JSON: `{plugins: [...]}`)
- `register` — one-time passkey-registration link for inviting a member (constraints JSON: `{member}`; forced single-use). Minted **inert**; requires a member's passkey approval at `/invite/{token}` (sets `approved_at`) before `/setup` accepts it. Not usable as an API token (doesn't match `*`); rejects `owner` and non-roster members.

### Internal tables

- `_schema_history` — log of all schema changes
- `_pending_changes` — proposed but uncommitted changes
- `_access_tokens` — unified scoped access tokens (optional `member` attribution)
- `_members` — roster of people sharing the hive (label/display_name/role/status); `owner` seeded + reserved. See "Shared hive" under Auth.
- `_passkeys` — WebAuthn credentials, one row per member (`member` column; NULL = owner bootstrap). Not agent-facing (created via the setup flow, not `mutate`).
- `_shared` — entry-level sharing for HTTP access
- `_outputs` / `_inputs` — HTTP I/O endpoint definitions
- `_publications` — declarative outbound projections served at `/p/{path}`; rendering is always derived, never stored
- `_documents` — file-store metadata (title/tags/visibility + system-managed r2_key/size/content_type/stored_at); bytes live in R2, served at `/f/{id}`
- `_system_docs` — agent orientation docs (seeded from `src/system-docs/*.md`)
- `_web_cache` — adapter-fetched web content (Bluesky threads 24h, browser-rendered markdown 30d). TTL = re-fetch horizon, not eviction: active content is retained indefinitely as memory; only superseded duplicates are GC'd (7-day grace, pinned excluded). A re-fetch that returns empty keeps the existing snapshot (snapshot protection in web.ts). `pinned` column + `resolve(retain: true)` freeze a snapshot forever (always served, never re-fetched/GC'd) until `retain: false`; pinning stays system-managed (`_web_cache` is INTERNAL_WRITE_PROTECTED — driven only through resolve, never agent mutate)
- `_canvases` — tldraw document snapshots for the Canvas spatial-thinking UI (full document state in the `snapshot` facet — do not modify directly; mutate via canvas tools/UI). Entry-type shapes inside the snapshot store **only references** (`{type: 'entry', pattern, entryId, x, y, w, h}`) — display label and facet preview are hydrated at render time from the live entry. Do not denormalize entry data into the snapshot; it goes stale.
- `_fragment_access_log` — append-only log of prime hits per short-term fragment. Promotion to `_long_term_fragments` is COUNT(*)-derived from this log, not a stored counter. GC'd alongside fragments. Audit-exempt (high-frequency append-only).
- `_entry_access_log` — append-only log of prime hits per user-pattern entry. Feeds decay (`last_touch`) and the stale view. Audit-exempt, write-protected, GC'd at 90 days.
- `_maintenance_passes` — record of completed memory-maintenance passes; days-since-last-pass is derived from the latest row, never stored.

## Tech stack

- **Runtime**: Cloudflare Workers + Durable Objects (SQLite storage)
- **MCP**: `agents` npm package (`McpAgent` class), `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`
- **Auth**: `@cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider` (OAuth 2.1 + PKCE + DCR), `@simplewebauthn/server` for passkeys
- **AI**: Workers AI (embeddings) + Vectorize (KNN index, `mnemion-vectors` / per-env `*-vectors`)
- **Validation**: Zod for tool parameter schemas
- **Storage**: KV for OAuth tokens, DO SQLite for all user data
- **Frontend**: Svelte 5 (component framework only, no SvelteKit), Vite for SSR + client builds

### Wrangler bindings

- `MCP_OBJECT` — SessionDO binding (required name; `McpAgent.serve()` expects it)
- `MNEMION_HIVE` — HiveDO binding
- `OAUTH_KV` — OAuth token storage
- `AI` — Workers AI for embeddings
- `VECTORIZE` — Vectorize index for prime KNN
- `DOCUMENTS` — R2 bucket for document blobs (`mnemion-documents`; bytes for the `_documents` store). **Optional**: ships commented out in `wrangler.toml` (a binding to a non-existent bucket fails deploy), and `Env.DOCUMENTS` is optional. Mnemion runs fully without R2 — only `/f` upload/serve degrade (create returns a `documents_note`; `POST /f` → 503). Enable via dashboard → Storage & databases → R2, then `npm run enable-documents` (creates the bucket + uncomments the binding) and `npm run deploy`. When R2 is off, the index annotates `_documents` with an `unavailable` note and the MCP init message flags it so agents can tell the user. Document *contents* are not yet indexed for search/prime (metadata is); text extraction is the future seam.

### Environments

- Default — production deploy (host comes from your CF account's `workers.dev` subdomain, or a custom route).
- `[env.test]` — `Auth.DEV` mode, no secret. Used as a federation peer / test target. Provision with `wrangler deploy --env test` after the main env exists.

## Key conventions

- The `agents` package bundles its own `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`. Pin the top-level dep to match (currently 1.26.0) to avoid type conflicts.
- McpAgent's base class has a `sql` tagged template property. Use `db` as the name for the raw `ctx.storage.sql` accessor in HiveDO.
- The DO binding must be named `MCP_OBJECT` — the `McpAgent.serve()` method expects this.
- `wrangler.toml` requires `compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]` for the agents package.
- Kernel columns (`id`, `version`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `archived_at`, `created_by`, `updated_by`) are auto-provided on every pattern. They cannot be defined via `propose_change`. `created_by`/`updated_by` are set by the mutate engine from the session actor (not facets, not caller-settable).
- Structure is resources, operations are tools. If it describes what the organism is, it's a resource. If it changes what the organism is or retrieves dynamic content, it's a tool.
- Product name and URI scheme are defined in `src/constants.ts`. Import `PRODUCT_NAME`, `URI_SCHEME`, `uri()` from there — never hardcode `"mnemion://"` in source.
- `@simplewebauthn/server` is lazy-imported in `routes/auth.ts` to avoid `tslib` resolution issues in the vitest/workerd test environment.
- System docs live in `src/system-docs/*.md` with YAML frontmatter (`slug`, `title`). Placeholders (`{{PRODUCT_NAME}}`, `{{uri:path}}`) are resolved at runtime by `resolveDocPlaceholders()` in schema.ts.
- `wrangler.toml` has a `[[rules]]` entry to import `.md` files as text modules.

## Design principle: data is destiny

`project-docs/data-is-destiny.md` is doctrine. Operational rules derived from it:

- **Store truth once, derive its consequences.** Counts, summaries, labels, and previews are computed at read time, not stored as columns. The `entry_count`/`latest_activity` on `/api/index` are SQL-computed every call. Entry labels are derived via `src/labels.ts` (`deriveLabel`) wherever they're needed; never persisted.
- **Snapshots store references, not denormalized data.** Canvas entry shapes hold `{pattern, entryId}` and hydrate from the live entry; `_fragment_access_log` is the source of promotion eligibility, not a stored counter.
- **Audit logs are exempt** — `_mutation_log`, `_schema_history`, `_pending_changes` are point-in-time records on purpose.
- **Caches are bounded with explicit invalidation policy** — `_web_cache` has per-adapter TTLs (re-fetch horizon) with superseded-duplicate GC; resolved content is retained as durable memory, not evicted on TTL. Vectorize embeddings are re-upserted on every mutate via `embedAfterMutate`.
- **Schema integrity is checked at boot.** `verifyFieldsIntegrity` in `schema.ts` walks every pattern and warns on drift between actual table DDL and the `_fields` metadata table — guards against migration mistakes producing lying agent-facing schemas. `_fields` is the long-standing partial duplication that justifies the check; full deduplication (deriving facet metadata from PRAGMA) is a future cleanup.
- **`WORKER_HOST` is derived at runtime.** HiveDO records the inbound `Host` header in `fetch()`; `_system/instance` doc is regenerated on every read from that, with `env.WORKER_HOST` as cold-start fallback only.

## Design principle: code as schematic

Structure code as declarative, scannable tables — not procedural chains. A reader should grasp the system's shape from the declarations alone, without tracing control flow. Enums for categories, typed records for configuration, implementation in focused single-purpose files.

The route table in `index.ts` is the reference example: method, pattern, auth gate, and handler on one line per route. The full routing surface is visible in 15 lines. The `CHANGE_TYPES` table in `evolution.ts` follows the same pattern: validate, preview, apply per change type — the full schema evolution surface scannable in one table.

Domain logic lives in pure-function modules with context injected. HiveDO builds context objects (`dataCtx()`, `evoCtx()`) and delegates. No God objects — each module owns one concern.

## Router architecture

Declarative dispatch table in `src/router.ts`. Routes are matched in declaration order.

- **`Method`** enum: `GET`, `POST`, `ANY`
- **`Auth`** enum: `NONE` (default), `DEV` (no secret configured), `CONFIGURED` (secret required to exist), `SECRET` (Basic auth against master secret)
- **`where`** constraints: regex validation on extracted params (e.g. `{ token: /^[a-fA-F0-9]+$/ }`)
- **`RouteContext`**: `request`, `url`, `env`, `params`, `store` — passed to every handler

Route handlers are grouped by domain in `src/routes/`. OAuthProvider intercepts `/mcp`, `/token`, `/register` before the dispatch table runs.

## Svelte frontend

- **No SvelteKit** — Svelte as component framework only, worker serves pages.
- Three Vite builds (chained in `npm run build:pages`): main client + canvas client (`vite.canvas.ts`) + SSR server bundle. Each emits `.client.txt` text modules consumed by route handlers via wrangler `[[rules]]`.
- Session cookies (HMAC-SHA256) via `Auth.SESSION` gate for browser pages.
- Pages:
  - **SchemaViewer** — pattern browser + entry editor (extracted detail logic into `EntryDetail.svelte`)
  - **HiveMap** — force-directed pattern visualization
  - **LinkMap** — cross-pattern reference graph
  - **Canvas** (`/canvas`) — tldraw-based infinite canvas for spatial thinking; persists snapshots to `_canvases` via `/api/canvas`. Murderboard-style: drag pattern instances, group/note/link elements, draw connections.
- WebSocket live updates via Hibernatable API on HiveDO.
- Test environment configured as `[env.test]` in wrangler.toml (Auth.DEV mode).

## Development

```bash
cd mnemion-js
npm install
npm run dev          # build:pages + wrangler dev on :8787 (dev mode, no secret needed)
npm run preview      # vite dev with mock data (frontend-only iteration, no worker)
npm run build:pages  # main client + canvas client + SSR — all required before dev/deploy
npm run types        # regenerate worker-configuration.d.ts from wrangler.toml
```

## Testing

```bash
cd mnemion-js
npm test             # vitest run — full suite
npm run test:watch   # vitest in watch mode
npx vitest run path/to/file.test.ts                 # single test file
npx vitest run -t "name of test"                    # tests matching a name
```

Tests live in `mnemion-js/src/__tests__/` and run inside `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers` (workerd runtime). `isolatedStorage: true` rolls back DO SQLite between tests. `tsconfig` excludes `src/__tests__` because tests import the `cloudflare:test` virtual module. Use `fetchMock` from `cloudflare:test` to mock outbound HTTP in DO tests (`activate()`/`deactivate()` per test).

## First-time setup

```bash
cd mnemion-js
npm run setup    # generates secret, deploys, prints passkey registration URL
```

This generates a 256-bit random master secret, sets it via wrangler, deploys, and opens the passkey registration page. Run again anytime to rotate the secret and re-register.

## Deploy

```bash
cd mnemion-js
npm run deploy   # deploy code changes (does not rotate secret)
```
