## youtube-to-markdown

> Convert a YouTube URL into a markdown file that combines a faster-whisper transcript with Claude-vision descriptions of keyframes (on-screen text, chart data, slide contents). Output is written in the source language of the video. Use when the user gives a YouTube link and asks for a transcript, notes, a markdown file, or on-screen visual information captured — especially for talk-style videos with slides or charts.


# youtube-to-markdown

Convert a YouTube URL into a single markdown file containing:
1. Video metadata
2. A table of keyframes (thumbnail + one-line caption)
3. Per-keyframe detailed visual description (OCR of on-screen text)
4. The full transcript with timestamps, keyframe markers inlined at their moments

**Output language matches the source language of the video** (detected by whisper).

## Inputs

Positional: `<url>`

Flags (optional):
- `--slug <name>` — filename slug. Default: auto-derived as `<YYYY-MM-DD>-<title-slug>` from metadata (publish date prepended; CJK preserved; unsafe chars stripped; title portion capped at 60 chars).
- `--lang <code>` — force whisper language (e.g. `zh`, `en`, `ja`). Default: auto-detect.
- `--interval <sec>` — keyframe sampling interval. Default: `60`.
- `--out-dir <path>` — root directory for per-video folders. Default: `./raw/youtube` (CWD-relative).
- `--img-dir <path>` — override images subfolder. Default: `<out-dir>/<slug>/images`.

**Default output layout** (with no flags): `./raw/youtube/<slug>/<slug>.md` and `./raw/youtube/<slug>/images/*.jpg`. Each video is a self-contained bundle.

## Pipeline — execute these steps in order

### 1. Prep

Derive a staging dir: `/tmp/ytmd-<video_id>` (extract the `v=` param from the URL; if the URL is `youtu.be/X`, that's the id).

Run:
```bash
~/.claude/skills/youtube-to-markdown/scripts/prep.sh <url> /tmp/ytmd-<video_id> [--interval N] [--lang X]
```

If it exits non-zero, surface the stderr tail and stop. Common failures:
- Missing `~/.local/share/whisper-venv` → tell user to create the venv and `pip install faster-whisper`
- `yt-dlp` failure → URL invalid or network issue
- `ffmpeg` missing → `apt install ffmpeg`

After success the staging dir contains: `metadata.json`, `audio.mp3`, `video.mp4`, `transcript.json`, `frames/t0001.jpg ...`, `frames.json`.

### 2. Read frames

Read `transcript.json` first to learn `info.language` — you will write descriptions in that language.

Then use the `Read` tool on each file in `frames/`. Call Read on **up to 12 frames in a single message** (parallel tool calls) to keep the turn short. If there are more than 12, do it across multiple messages.

For each frame, mentally note:
- What type of content it shows (talking head, chart, slide, code, screenshot, etc.)
- Any on-screen text — transcribe it (prices, axis labels, slide titles, bullet points, table values). This is the high-value part; the transcript already has what the speaker *said*.
- Whether it's a near-duplicate of the previous frame (same slide held across a 60s window)

### 3. Write descriptions.json

Save to `/tmp/ytmd-<video_id>/descriptions.json` a JSON array where each element has:

```json
{
  "index": 1,                          // frame number (matches t0001.jpg)
  "t_sec": 0,                          // (index - 1) * interval
  "keep": true,                        // false for near-duplicates
  "slug": "01-spx-overview",           // short kebab-case label, prefix with index for ordering
  "description": "标普500日K图..."      // 1-3 sentences in the source language
}
```

Rules:
- Mark `keep: false` when the current frame is visually near-identical to the previously kept frame (same slide, same chart with only cursor moved). Aim for roughly 40–70% of frames kept on average for slide-heavy videos.
- `description` must be in the video's source language. Include specific on-screen numbers and text — this is what makes the output useful. Don't just say "a chart is shown" — say *what* the chart shows.
- `slug` should be unique and descriptive. Prefix with a two-digit index so filenames sort chronologically.

### 4. Assemble

Just point `assemble.py` at the staging dir — it derives the slug and all output paths automatically:

```bash
~/.claude/skills/youtube-to-markdown/scripts/assemble.py /tmp/ytmd-<video_id>
```

Only pass flags if the user provided overrides:
```bash
~/.claude/skills/youtube-to-markdown/scripts/assemble.py /tmp/ytmd-<video_id> \
  [--out-dir <path>] [--slug <name>] [--img-dir <path>]
```

It prints a JSON summary on stdout with: `output_md`, `images_dir`, `bundle_dir`, `slug`, detected language, kept/total frame counts, paragraph count. Image references inside the written `.md` are `images/<frame-slug>.jpg` (relative to the `.md`).

### 5. Report

Tell the user in a short message:
- Path to the markdown file
- Path to the images directory
- Detected language
- Kept / total frame count
- Any notable signals (e.g. "transcript is 45 minutes, you may want to skim")

### 6. Cleanup (optional)

Leave `/tmp/ytmd-<video_id>` in place so the user can inspect intermediate artifacts. Only delete if they ask.

## Failure modes and fallbacks

| Symptom | Cause | What to try |
|---|---|---|
| `cuda failed` in transcribe log | GPU busy or no CUDA libs | Script auto-falls back to CPU int8 — warn user this will be slower (10–30 min for a 1h video) |
| `yt-dlp did not produce audio.mp3` | Video is age-gated or region-blocked | Ask user to confirm they can watch it; suggest `--cookies-from-browser` |
| Empty `frames/` dir after ffmpeg | Video is audio-only | Re-run `assemble.py` with an empty descriptions.json `[]` — you'll get a transcript-only markdown |
| Transcript has one huge segment | VAD disabled, or very long silences | Try `--prompt` env var `YTMD_PROMPT` to bias segmentation |
| Descriptions out-of-language | Whisper misdetected language (rare for mixed-language videos) | Re-run with `--lang <correct-code>` |

## Design notes (for maintenance)

- **Why whisper large-v3 and not small/medium?** Chinese and Japanese especially benefit from the larger model. On the 5080 it transcribes a 22-minute video in ~1 minute. CPU fallback path uses int8 quantization to stay usable.
- **Why 60s intervals and not scene detection?** Tested both on the smoke-test video (talking-head with slide overlays). Scene detection at threshold 0.15 produced only 7 frames over 22 minutes; fixed 60s gives even coverage and catches slide changes that scene detection misses because the background (speaker's face) is mostly static.
- **Why dedup in Claude, not ffmpeg?** Perceptual hash dedup is fragile when slides have moving cursors or animated elements. Claude's visual judgment is more robust; the cost is one extra turn of work.
- **Why separate scripts + SKILL.md?** `prep.sh` and `assemble.py` are deterministic — no LLM needed. The two steps that require Claude's judgment (visual description, dedup decisions) happen in the turn, between the two scripts. This minimizes token usage and makes failures easy to reproduce.
