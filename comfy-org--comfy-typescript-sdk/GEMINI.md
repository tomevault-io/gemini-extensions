Notes for automated contributors (and humans) working in this repo. Everything
here is enforced by CI — see `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and `scripts/`.

## 1. Never hand-edit a generated file

This is the trap that costs a round trip: a hand-edit to generated code reads
fine in review, passes lint/typecheck/tests, and then fails the CI step
`Check the code coupled to spec/ is in sync with it`.

Generated, do **not** edit by hand:

| Path                             | Produced by                                    |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `src/low/generated/types.gen.ts` | `pnpm generate` (`@hey-api/openapi-ts`)        |
| `src/low/generated/zod.gen.ts`   | `pnpm generate`                                |
| `src/low/generated/index.ts`     | `pnpm generate`                                |
| `src/low/version.ts`             | `scripts/gen-version.mjs`, run by `pnpm build` |
| `parity/python-surface.json`     | `pnpm sync:python-surface` (see section 6)     |

`spec/openapi.yaml` is also off-limits: it is a vendored, one-way sync of the
canonical Comfy API v2 contract with internal operations stripped (see
`spec/README.md`). Fix the contract upstream; do not patch the vendored copy to
make codegen emit what you want. The same goes for `spec/router-openapi.yaml`,
the vendored Comfy Router contract — nothing is generated from it, but
`src/sdk/routerErrors.ts` is checked against it (section 2).

Everything else under `src/` is hand-written — including `src/low/index.ts`,
which is the aggregator for the whole low layer, **not** codegen output. Note
that `openapi-ts.config.ts` sets `clean: true` on the output directory, so any
file you add under `src/low/generated/` is deleted on the next regeneration.
That directory is also excluded from `oxlint` (`.oxlintrc.json`
`ignorePatterns`) and from `oxfmt` (`.prettierignore`); leave both exclusions
alone. Reformatting generated output makes it differ byte-for-byte from a fresh
generation, which is exactly what the drift check compares.

### Regenerating

```bash
pnpm generate          # rewrites src/low/generated/* from spec/openapi.yaml
pnpm check:spec-drift  # same check CI runs (node scripts/check-spec-drift.mjs)
```

`scripts/check-spec-drift.mjs` regenerates into a temp directory using the same
`openapi-ts.config.ts` and compares the three files above byte-for-byte against
what is committed. There is no tolerance for whitespace or ordering. It then
runs a second, unrelated check that needs no codegen — the Router route against
`spec/router-openapi.yaml` (section 2) — and reports both, so a stale
regeneration cannot hide a moved route.

## 2. Spec-coupled hand-written code

Seven hand-written things must be updated in lockstep when a vendored spec
changes. Three are coupled to `spec/openapi.yaml` and fail
`src/low/spec-coverage.test.ts`; the other four are coupled to
`spec/router-openapi.yaml` and fail `src/sdk/router-spec-coverage.test.ts` and
`src/sdk/router-spec-contract.test.ts` respectively. Only the route check and
the collect check (fourth and sixth below) name the constant to fix; for the
rest the failure message will not tell you this:

- **`src/low/transport.ts` — `OPERATION_IDS`.** Must equal, as a set, the
  `operationId` of every non-internal operation in `spec/openapi.yaml`. A spec
  sync that adds an operation is not done until a transport method exists for
  it.
- **`src/low/transport.ts` — `OPERATION_METHODS`.** Maps every operation ID to
  a method name that must actually exist on `ComfyLow.prototype`. The test
  checks both directions of the mapping and the method's existence.
- **`src/sdk/routerErrors.ts` — the closed `error_type` set.** Checked against
  a _different_ spec: `spec/router-openapi.yaml`, whose
  `components.schemas.RouterErrorType.x-comfy-error-types` names every bucket,
  its tier and its meaning. `src/sdk/router-spec-coverage.test.ts` asserts the
  buckets, their order, their tier split and the class per bucket in both
  directions. Nothing is generated from that spec, so this test is its drift
  check — a Router spec sync that adds a bucket is not done until a
  `RouterError` subclass exists for it, named the PascalCase of the wire value.
  Adding one usually also needs a `routerErrorClassesAheadOfPython` entry in
  `src/sdk/surface-parity.test.ts` until the Python twin lands (section 6).
- **`src/sdk/models.ts` — `RUN_ROUTE_TEMPLATE`, and `src/sdk/credentials.ts` —
  `COMFY_ROUTER_BASE_URL`.** The path `comfy.models.run` posts to and the host
  it posts to by default, checked against `spec/router-openapi.yaml`'s
  `runRouterModel` path, its path parameters and its `servers[0].url`. Checked
  in two places on purpose: `src/sdk/router-spec-contract.test.ts` compares the
  live constants in `pnpm test`, and `scripts/check-spec-drift.mjs` compares
  the same constants read out of their source text (plain Node, no TypeScript
  loader) so `pnpm check:spec-drift` reddens too. Both messages name the
  constant to update. The vendored spec is the side that is right — a Router
  sync that moves the route is not done until the constant follows, and until
  it does `comfy.models.run` 404s. The shared spec reader is
  `scripts/router-route-contract.mjs`. The ID parsing those routes depend on
  (`parseModelId`, `parseRequestId`, `fillRoute`) lives in
  `src/sdk/modelRoutes.ts`, a leaf both `models.ts` and `modelRequests.ts`
  import so that neither has to import the other for it.
- **`src/sdk/modelRequests.ts` — the four `MODEL_REQUEST*` route templates.**
  The queued surface (`comfy.models.submit` / `subscribe` / `handle`) addresses
  a `requests` collection under the run route. Those four operations are **not
  in `spec/router-openapi.yaml` yet** — they are authored upstream but held,
  and the one-way sync strips a held operation — so there is nothing to compare
  them against and the pin is a RELATION instead: `router-spec-contract.test.ts`
  asserts each template is the run route plus its fixed suffix, which is what
  makes a sync that moves the run route move these too. That block ends with a
  rot guard that fails the day the vendored contract DOES declare the
  collection; when it fires, read those paths out of the spec the way
  `readRouterRouteContract` reads `runRouterModel`'s and compare against them
  instead. The Python SDK binds the same four the same way.
- **`src/sdk/retry.ts` — `isCollectable`.** The statuses on which
  `comfy.models.run` re-sends the SAME `Idempotency-Key` to collect a
  generation already running. That set is not this SDK's to choose: Router
  sends `Retry-After` only where it holds a handle to collect from, so
  `src/sdk/router-spec-contract.test.ts` reads which `runRouterModel` responses
  declare that header and asserts the predicate accepts exactly those. A sync
  that moved the header — onto a `429`, or off the `409` — would otherwise
  leave the SDK re-sending an answer nothing blesses, or refusing to collect a
  generation Comfy is still holding.
- **`src/low/models.ts`.** Holds four schemas codegen cannot reach, because
  `@hey-api/openapi-ts` only emits types reachable from an operation's
  request/response: `StatusEvent`, `PreviewEvent`, `LogEvent` (reachable only
  via the `x-sse-events` vendor extension) and `AssetReference` (the
  `core/ASSET` object embedded in workflow JSON). The test asserts their
  property lists match `components.schemas` in the spec exactly.

## 3. Public repo hygiene

This repo is public and `scripts/check-public-repo-hygiene.mjs` runs as its own
CI job. It scans every tracked text file (`git ls-files`), excluding only its
own source and `src/low/generated/`. **This file is scanned too**, as is any
doc, comment, test fixture, or commit-message-turned-doc you add. Three
categories fail the build:

1. **Ticket-shaped identifiers** — anything matching
   `\b[A-Z]{2,6}-\d{2,6}\b`. Note this is a shape, not a list of real team
   keys, so an innocent-looking token can trip it; the allowlist covers only
   things like `UTF-8`, `SHA-256`, `ISO-8601` and three specific RFC numbers.
   Branch names in this repo use ticket-shaped prefixes — do not carry one into
   a file.
2. **Internal collaboration-tool links** — Notion, Slack archive/client
   permalinks, Google Docs and Drive, Datadog, PostHog project URLs, the Linear
   app domain, and `incident-<number>` markers. Link to the public docs site,
   the GitHub issue, or nothing.
3. **References to org repos or teams outside the known-public allowlist.**
   `Comfy-Org/<name>` is default-deny: only the repos listed in the script are
   accepted, and `@Comfy-Org/<team>` handles are limited to the two teams in
   `.github/CODEOWNERS`. A new sibling repo needs an allowlist entry (with a
   comment saying it is public) before you can reference it.

A genuine false positive is fixed by extending the allowlist in the script with
a comment explaining why — not by deleting the check or excluding the file.

Keep this script in sync with `scripts/check_public_repo_hygiene.py` in the
Python SDK, per the note at the top of the file.

## 4. Checks a PR must pass

CI runs the `test` job on Node 22 **and** 24, plus two standalone jobs. Locally:

```bash
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm lint             # oxlint .
pnpm format:check     # oxfmt --check .
pnpm typecheck        # tsc --noEmit
pnpm check:spec-drift # node scripts/check-spec-drift.mjs
pnpm check:sdk-parity # node scripts/sync-python-surface.mjs (needs network)
pnpm test             # vitest run
pnpm build            # gen-version + tsc -> dist/
```

The three other jobs:

- **`build-check`** — `pnpm build`, then `pnpm pack`, then asserts the tarball
  contains `package/dist/index.js` and `package/dist/index.d.ts`. Touching
  `files`, `exports`, `main`, `types`, or `outDir` can break this while every
  other check stays green. Reproduce with
  `pnpm build && pnpm pack --pack-destination /tmp/pack-check && tar tzf /tmp/pack-check/*.tgz`.
- **`public-repo-hygiene`** — `node scripts/check-public-repo-hygiene.mjs`.
  Pure Node, no dependencies, so you can run it in a clean checkout without
  installing anything.
- **`sdk-parity`** — `node scripts/sync-python-surface.mjs`. The only job that
  reaches the network. See section 6.

A CLA check (`.github/workflows/cla.yml`) also runs; only the PR author needs
to sign. `.github/CODEOWNERS` makes every file require review from
`@Comfy-Org/comfy-cloud-team` or `@Comfy-Org/core-engine-team`.

## 5. Non-obvious conventions

- **`tsc --noEmit` does not check test files.** `tsconfig.json` excludes
  `src/**/*.test.ts`, and Vitest does not typecheck. A type error inside a test
  is caught by no gate in this repo — read your test code carefully.
- **Relative imports must carry a `.js` extension**, including from a `.ts`
  source (`./transport.js`, `./generated/types.gen.js`). The package is ESM
  with `moduleResolution: NodeNext`. Every relative import in `src/` follows
  this; an extensionless one will not resolve at runtime.
- **Do not bump `version` in `package.json`.** Releases are tag-driven:
  `.github/workflows/publish.yml` injects the release tag's version at build
  time, so the committed value is a placeholder. `pnpm build` regenerates
  `src/low/version.ts` from whatever `package.json` says, so a version edit
  shows up as an unexpected dirty file.
- **`oxfmt` formats Markdown, not just TypeScript.** `pnpm format:check` fails
  on an unformatted `.md` file, so a docs-only PR can fail the `test` job. Run
  `pnpm format` after editing any Markdown.
- **Tests are colocated** (`src/**/*.test.ts`) and run against
  `test/support/stub-server.ts`, a real Node `http` stub of the v2 API — there
  is no request-mocking library. Add a scenario to `ServerState` rather than
  intercepting `fetch`.
- **`src/` ships in the published package**, not just `dist/` — see the `files`
  field in `package.json` — so source comments are published too.
- This SDK deliberately mirrors the Python SDK's structure (stub server, drift
  check, hygiene check, generated/hand-written split). When changing one of
  those shared mechanisms, check whether the sibling needs the same change.

## 6. Cross-SDK surface parity

`src/sdk/surface-parity.test.ts` diffs this SDK's public surface against the
Python SDK's and fails naming the symbol that diverged: the public method names
under `models`, the router error class names, the `error_type` each of those
classes maps to, and the error classes the package root re-exports.

The Python side is read from `parity/python-surface.json`, a **committed
snapshot** — generated, do not hand-edit. `parity/README.md` has the full
mechanism; the short version is that the assertion runs offline against the
snapshot in `pnpm test`, and the `sdk-parity` CI job re-derives the snapshot
from the Python SDK's default branch over HTTPS so it cannot go quietly stale.

Two things to know before you touch it:

- **A `sdk-parity` failure is usually not about your branch.** It means the
  Python SDK's surface moved. Run `pnpm sync:python-surface`, commit the
  refreshed snapshot, then run `pnpm test` to see which symbols diverged.
- **Deliberate divergences go in the `INTENTIONAL_ASYMMETRIES` allowlist** at
  the top of the test, each with a stated reason. Four are declared today (the
  result envelope, credential resolution, the absence of a sync variant, and
  the router buckets this SDK currently leads on). Anything not declared there
  fails. Adding an entry is a design decision — the test also fails on an entry
  that no longer applies, so the list cannot rot into a blanket exemption.
- **A LEAD is not an asymmetry, and has its own field.** The two SDKs ship on
  separate pull requests, so one of them carries a new Router bucket — or a new
  `models` method — first. `routerErrorClassesAheadOfPython` and
  `modelsMethodsAheadOfPython` tolerate that in ONE direction — TypeScript may
  lead, never lag — and each has a rot guard that fails the moment the Python
  snapshot grows the same name, which is the signal to delete the entry rather
  than to grow it. `modelsMethodsAheadOfPython` carries `submit`, `subscribe`
  and `handle` today, because the queued surface landed here while the Python
  twin was still on an open pull request; run `pnpm sync:python-surface` once
  that change is on the Python default branch and delete the entry the rot
  guard then names. Do not reach for either field to excuse something this SDK
  invented: `router-spec-coverage.test.ts` only passes for a bucket the
  vendored Router contract actually declares.
