# knowing

Self-adapting code intelligence engine. Single Go binary, zero runtime deps.
Gets smarter with scale, not dumber: observes its own graph density and adjusts
retrieval strategy automatically. 38 edge types, 23 extractors, 28 MCP tools.

## Build & Test

```bash
GOWORK=off go build ./...           # build (GOWORK=off required: go.work refs missing module)
GOWORK=off go test ./internal/...   # unit tests
GOWORK=off go test ./cmd/...        # CLI tests
GOWORK=off go test ./bench/...      # benchmark harnesses (some need pre-indexed repos)
```

## Benchmark (P@10 evaluation)

```bash
# Full corpus, sequential (official numbers, ~20 min with pre-embedded vectors)

```

## Testing Methodology

Django is the acid test repo for retrieval experiments:
- 33 tasks (largest single-repo fixture set)
- 42% zero-rate problem (vocabulary gaps), so improvements that move Django are structural
- Where adaptive seeds showed +14.2%, bidirectional inheritance showed -2.5%, gap injection +3.2%

**Protocol:**
1. **Django only, no embeddings (~30s):** quick signal on structural changes
   ```bash
   BENCH_REPOS=django BENCH_ADAPTERS=knowing GOWORK=off go test ./bench/cross-system/ -run TestCrossSystem -v -timeout 10m
   ```
2. **Django with embeddings (~7min):** confirms interaction with re-ranker
   ```bash
   BENCH_EMBEDDINGS=1 BENCH_REPOS=django BENCH_ADAPTERS=knowing GOWORK=off go test ./bench/cross-system/ -run TestCrossSystem -v -timeout 30m
   ```
3. **Full corpus with embeddings (~80min):** only if Django moves positively
   ```bash
   BENCH_EMBEDDINGS=1 BENCH_ADAPTERS=knowing GOWORK=off go test ./bench/cross-system/ -run TestCrossSystem -v -timeout 0
   ```

If Django is neutral or negative, don't run the full corpus. If Django is positive,
the full corpus confirms whether it generalizes or gets absorbed by run variance.

**Important:** Not all experiments affect Django. Check graph density first:
```bash
sqlite3 <repo>/.knowing/graph.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM edges; SELECT COUNT(*) FROM nodes;"
```
Density = edges/nodes. Current densities: cargo 13.5, kafka 12.5, terraform 9.5,
ocelot 8.3, spark-java 7.7, kubernetes 6.2, flask 5.9, vscode 4.7, django 2.8.
If the experiment only affects dense graphs (like adaptive alpha), test on dense repos
(flask, cargo, kafka) instead of Django.

**Output capture:** Always capture full output to a file (`2>&1 | tee /tmp/file.log`
or `> /tmp/file.log 2>&1`). Never pipe through `tail` as it loses early output.

## When Benchmark Numbers Change

After any P@10 improvement, these files ALL need updating with the new aggregate,
per-repo breakdown, and competitive ratios. This is a standard procedure:

1. **bench/cross-system/FINDINGS.md** — executive summary, per-repo table, competitive advantages
2. **bench/CONTEXT-PACKING-STUDY.md** — Dimension 1, competitive summary, run history
3. **bench/README.md** — cross-system row in summary table
4. **docs/guide/introduction.md** — operational characteristics, measured performance table
5. **docs/architecture/retrieval-pipeline.md** — eval baseline line
6. **docs/architecture/system-overview.md** — benchmark section
7. **docs/architecture/design-principles.md** — benchmark results
8. **docs/architecture/context-engine.md** — current performance
9. **docs/architecture/embedding-reranker.md** — impact numbers
10. **docs/roadmap.md** — retrieval pipeline section
11. **docs/research/cross-system-benchmark.md** — key results table
12. **Blog post** (`/Users/dayna.blackwell/code/blog/content/posts/ai-code-context-tools-benchmark.md`) — headline table, per-repo, ratios
13. **npm/knowing/README.md** — package description on npmjs.com
14. **pypi/README.md** — package description on PyPI
15. **CLAUDE.md** — this file, Current State section
16. **README.md** — Numbers table

Competitive ratios to recalculate from new P@10:
- vs codegraph: P@10 / 0.135
- vs codebase-memory: P@10 / 0.137
- vs GitNexus: P@10 / 0.075
- vs Gortex: P@10 / 0.063
- vs grep: P@10 / 0.013

## Current State (session 17, 2026-05-27)

- **P@10 = 0.223 cold start, 0.249 with compounding** (222 tasks, 12 repos, 7 languages, 38 edge types)
- **Self-adapting compounding:** +11.5% P@10 from passive task memory (round 1 to round 2)
- **Density-adaptive:** PreferTypeSeeds >40K nodes, adaptive seed count >10K nodes
- **Embedding re-ranker:** +17% P@10, pure re-rank (weight=0.0), vector cache 220ms
- **LSP enrichment:** strongly positive. Go: k8s 0.000->0.232, terraform ~0.095->0.275. Python: +0.040
- **Competitive (cold):** 1.65x codegraph, 1.63x codebase-memory, 2.97x GitNexus, 3.54x Gortex, 17.2x grep
- **Competitive (warm):** 1.84x codegraph, 1.82x codebase-memory, 3.32x GitNexus, 3.95x Gortex, 19.2x grep
- **Supply chain:** 1.0% FP on 200 clean packages (package-level verdict)
- **Identity:** "self-adapting code intelligence engine that gets smarter with scale"

## Key Findings (inform all future retrieval work)

1. **P@10 is reachability-determined.** 32-config parameter sweep + seed count sweep (10-50) proved zero variance. Only new edges or new seed sources move the metric. Don't tune weights.
2. **Dense graph dilution is a seed selection problem.** Edge exclusion, BFS depth, hub dampening all tested neutral. Fix: density-adaptive seed selection (PreferTypeSeeds + adaptive seed count).
3. **Embedding architecture > model.** Three models neutral as Channel 3 (independent search). Same models +17% as re-ranker. The integration point matters, not the model.
4. **Enrichment is strongly positive for retrieval.** Session 13 found neutral (tested confidence upgrades only). Session 17 revised: Go enrichment k8s 0.000->0.232, terraform ~0.095->0.275. Python +0.040. Phantom nodes + type_hint_of edges create shared-type reachability paths. Neither works alone.
5. **42% of Django tasks score zero.** Vocabulary gaps: ground truth symbols share no keywords with task. No parameter tuning fixes this. Need new candidate sources.
6. **Gap injection concept is sound but BM25 is too noisy.** Embedding-filtered BM25 gap candidates: Django +3.2% but aggregate neutral. Need higher-precision candidate source.
7. **Coherence packing, bidirectional inheritance: both harmful.** Greedy density packing is near-optimal. Reverse inherits edges add noise without reachability.

## Experiment Summary (44 total across sessions 8-17)

### What works
| Experiment | Impact | Session |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Inheritance propagation | +29% | 13 |
| Embedding re-ranker (pure, weight=0.0) | +17% | 15 |
| Adaptive seed count (>40K: 25, >10K: 20) | Django +14.2%, corpus +1.7% | 16 |
| PreferTypeSeeds (>40K nodes) | VS Code +44% | 14 |
| Docstring FTS indexing | +12.2% | 13 |
| Task memory compounding | +11.5% P@10 round-over-round | 17 |
| Go enrichment (two-phase warmup) | k8s 0.000->0.232, terraform ~0.095->0.275 | 17 |
| Equivalence classes (115 concepts) | +8pp hard tier | 14 |
| Vector cache (SQLite) | 660ms -> 220ms | 16 |
| Dangling type_hint_of resolution | 3,836 edges fixed across 4 repos | 17 |

### What doesn't work
Embeddings as Channel 3, blended re-rank, call-chain seeding, hub dampening, BFS depth reduction, framework thesaurus, coherence packing, bidirectional inheritance, raw BM25 gap injection, seed count tuning (10-50), gap parameter sweep (15 configs), density-adaptive RWR alpha, density-adaptive inherits weight, interface type hint propagation (edge structure mismatch), GraphNodeCount excluding phantoms (phantoms are valid density signal). All neutral or harmful. See docs/roadmap.md for details.

## Repos

- `blackwell-systems/knowing` — OSS engine (MIT, public)
- `blackwell-systems/knowing-supply-scan` — GHA action (MIT, public, v1.0.0)
- `blackwell-systems/platform` — API server (private, scaffold)

## Next Priorities

1. **Embedding gap-fill seeds** (HIGH): when BM25 returns < 5 seeds, query sqlite-vec ANN for supplemental candidates. Targets django's 42% zero-rate without regressing strong repos. Prerequisites: sqlite-vec + pre-embed all nodes.
2. **Deploy platform API** (DigitalOcean Droplet + Cloudflare Tunnel). DEPLOY.md and deploy.sh ready.
3. **Update all benchmark docs** with 12-repo/222-task/0.223 cold/0.249 warm numbers.
4. **Publish benchmark paper** on Zenodo (docs/research/whitepapers/code-context-retrieval-benchmark.md)
5. **v0.11.0 release**: 50+ unreleased commits
6. **Zig extractor**: tree-sitter-zig grammar exists, vendor parser.c. LinkedIn interest.
7. **Re-test hub dampening, coherence, BFS depth** on enriched graphs (may flip post-enrichment)
8. **Org conversion** (blackwell-systems user -> org for Marketplace)

## Common Pitfalls

- **Persistent pack cache masks experiments.** `DisablePersistentCache()` is required in benchmark adapter or results are stale. The notes-table cache returns previous run's output.
- **BENCH_EMBEDDINGS=1 required for re-ranker.** Without it, embeddings don't load and P@10 stays at ~0.207 (no re-ranker). With it, P@10=0.242.
- **Django has 33 tasks in bench.** Consistently 33 fixtures on disk.
- **Kubernetes P@10 varies +-0.05 between runs.** High variance from 19-22 task subset loading and embedding non-determinism. Don't chase k8s fluctuations.
- **`knowing index` runs LSP enrichment by default.** Use `-no-enrich` when you only need tree-sitter edges (supply chain scanning, quick benchmarks). Saves ~14s per package.
- **The knowing binary on PATH may be stale.** After code changes, rebuild with `GOWORK=off go build -o /tmp/knowing-test ./cmd/knowing/` for testing. Or `go install`.
- **`command npm` not `npm`.** nvm shell hook interferes. Always use `command npm`.
- **Don't use `timeout` on long-running commands.** Let indexing, enrichment, and benchmarks run until they finish. Kill manually if they go too long. `timeout` causes premature kills on processes that are legitimately slow (gopls loading, tsserver type-checking, kafka authorship).
- **Never delete benchmark corpus DBs.** The DBs at `bench/cross-system/corpus/repos/<repo>/.knowing/graph.db` are gitignored and can't be restored from git. Enrichment status: Python (django, flask, fastapi) enriched with pyright. Java (spark-java, kafka) enriched with jdtls. TypeScript (vscode) enriched with tsserver. Go (terraform, kubernetes, caddy) enriched with gopls (two-phase warmup). Rust (cargo) enriched with rust-analyzer. C# (ocelot) enriched with csharp-ls. All 12 repos are enriched. If you need to test with modified indexing, copy the DB first.

## Debugging Hung Processes

When a process appears stuck, use these tools to diagnose instead of guessing:

- **`sample <pid> 1`** (macOS): samples native call stacks for 1 second. Shows where threads are spending time (active CPU work vs idle waits). If all threads are in `pthread_cond_wait`, the process is blocked on I/O, not CPU-bound.
- **`kill -SIGQUIT <pid>`** (Go processes): dumps all goroutine stacks to stderr. Shows the exact function and line where each goroutine is blocked. Go's built-in equivalent of strace for goroutines. The process exits after the dump.
- **`ps aux | grep <name> | awk '{print "CPU:", $3"%", "TIME:", $10}'`**: quick check whether a process is actively working (high CPU) or idle (low CPU with high wall clock time).

Example workflow from session 17:
1. `sample` showed gopls threads idle in `pthread_cond_wait` while enricher also idle: both waiting for each other, not CPU-bound.
2. `SIGQUIT` goroutine dump showed 8 goroutines blocked in `sendRequest -> selectgo -> GetDefinition`: enricher sending requests gopls wasn't answering.
3. `sample` on tsserver showed `StringIndexOf` and `GarbageCollection`: actively type-checking, not stuck.

These tools turn "it's hanging" into "here's exactly where and why."

## Conventions

- Always use `GOWORK=off` (go.work references shelfctl which may not be present)
- Run benchmark before AND after shipping any retrieval/engine changes
- Do NOT use em dashes in prose or documentation
- Use `command npm` to bypass nvm shell hook
- Check CI: `gh run list --limit 5`
- Commit messages: conventional commits (feat:, fix:, docs:)
- Do not commit CLAUDE.md to git (it's in .gitignore)
