# Brief Compiler - Agent Guidelines

See CLAUDE.md for complete documentation. This file ensures OpenCode picks up the same guidelines.

## Quick Reference

### Commands
- **Build**: `cargo build`
- **Test**: `cargo test --lib`
- **Test backend registry**: `cargo test --lib -- backend::tests`
- **Compile RBV**: `./target/release/brief-compiler rbv <file.rbv>`
- **Benchmark**: `bash benchmarks/build_and_bench.sh` — always use this harness (nanosecond CLOCK_MONOTONIC, 5-iteration average). Ad-hoc timing produces false hangs and imprecise numbers.

### File Types
- **.bv** - Brief (standard Brief file, cosmopolitan tier — any FFI, any language, OS assumed)
- **.sbv** - Strict Brief (full contracts required, no sugar defaults)
- **.rbv** - Rendered Brief (Brief + View, compiles to web frontend. Like `.tsx` is to `.ts`)
- **.srbv** - Strict Rendered Brief (full contracts required in web target)
- **.ebv** - Embedded Brief (bare metal — no OS, no GC. C/Rust FFI allowed but Python/Java warned)
- **.sebv** - Strict Embedded Brief (full contracts required, bare metal)
- **.hebv** - Hardware Embedded Brief (pure logic graph — no FFI, no external deps, only synthesizable types. Contracts must be total. Outputs Verilog/VHDL/SV)
- **.dbv/.dbvs/.dbvl** - Data Brief (configuration with schema, think `.xml`/`.xmls`/`.jsonl`)

### Contract Sugar Syntax

Brief provides sugar for single-sided contracts. Use these where possible in the stdlib
to teach readers the pattern:

| Syntax | Precondition | Postcondition | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `[pre][post]` | `pre` | `post` | Full contract (both sides) |
| `[[post]` | `true` (omitted) | `post` | Postcondition only, no guard. **The opening `[[` means the precondition was omitted.** |
| `[pre]]` | `pre` | `true` (omitted) | Guard only, no guarantee. **The closing `]]` means the postcondition was omitted.** |

Memory aid: the left bracket `[` is always the precondition. `[[` = two left brackets = the
first one opens an empty precondition (defaults to `true`), the second opens the postcondition.
`]]` = two right brackets = the first closes the precondition, the second closes an empty
postcondition (defaults to `true`).

**Banned in**: `.sbv`, `.srbv`, `.sebv`, `.hebv` (strict tiers require explicit both-sided contracts).

**Preferred in**: `.bv`, `.ebv`, `.rbv` stdlib examples. Use the sugar to keep code readable
while teaching users the pattern.

### Critical Philosophy

**CONTRACT-FIRST**: Contracts are the source of truth. Never weaken contracts to match lazy code.

**NO MAGIC**: Never add hardcoded Rust string matches as "built-in" functions.
- If a `.bv` file needs `is_digit`, import `char` from `"std/char.bv"` — NOT a Rust match arm.
- If a `.bv` file needs `None`, import `option` from `"std/option.bv"` — NOT pre-populating state.
- The FFI system (`frgn from "..."`) and the standard library are the transparent paths. Use them.

**SELF-DOCUMENTING FAILURE**: Before fixing any issue:
1. Understand WHY the fix works (not just THAT it works)
2. Document the root cause in BUGS.md
3. Ensure the fix doesn't violate Contract-First or No Magic

### Anti-Patterns (NEVER DO)
- Changing `[product > 0]` to `[true]` because code doesn't set product
- Using generic contracts like `[true]` that pass everything
- Adding postconditions that don't guarantee specific outcomes
- Adding Rust string-match built-ins when the standard library or import system should be used
- Pre-populating interpreter state with enum constants (None, Some, Ok, Err)
- Adding `x == x` self-references in preconditions to force liveness
- Adding synthetic exit-condition fields solely to prevent dead-field elimination
- **Hardcoded `from` strings**: `from "libruntime"` is magic — parsed and discarded. Use `from "c"` or omit `from` entirely (symbol resolves from `import "link/..."` targets).
- **Hardcoded runtime declares**: `__rt_init`, `__rt_wait`, etc. must be declared as `frgn` in `std/rt.bv` and imported by the user — never hardcoded in `emit_declares()`.
- **Name-based interpreter dispatch**: Matching on `fn_name == "insert"` instead of dispatching on `Value::HashMap` — dispatch on the type, not on a string.
- **`"None"`/`"Err"` discriminant magic**: Never match on variant names for discriminants. Use the enum declaration order.
- **Type-based dispatch**: In the interpreter, dispatch on `Value` variant, not on string-matching the function name.

### Observability as Liveness

A program that produces no observable effect IS dead code. The compiler is correct to eliminate it.

Brief's liveness model: **a value is live if an FFI call consumes it.** Every program must interact with the world — print, file I/O, network — via `frgn` calls.

If the compiler folded your hot loop to `store i64 N`, **the compiler is right.** Your program produced no observable output. The fix is NOT liveness hacks (`x == x`, synthetic exit fields). The fix IS `frgn __print_int(result)`.

The C reference must use the SAME observable. Symmetric benchmarks, symmetric optimizations.

#### `term! -> swan_song` is the correct liveness pattern for terminal programs

When a program must run a specific FFI call (print, write) as its final act before exiting,
use `term! -> frgn_call(args);`. The `term!` emits `ret` — a function terminator that the
optimizer cannot eliminate. The swan song runs as a statement before `ret`, so the FFI call
is structurally live by construction.

**Do NOT:**
- Use `io_pending` or other opaque triggers purely to prevent fold elimination
- Add `#!exit` pragmas when `term!` already terminates the program
- Add synthetic exit-condition fields or `x == x` self-references
- Complain that `main` is just `ret` — if your program produces no observable output,
  the compiler is RIGHT to eliminate it. The fix is `frgn __print_int(result)`, not hacks.

**The correct pattern:**
```brief
frgn __get_env_int(name: Ptr<Byte>) -> Int ;
frgn __print_int(n: Int) -> Bool ;
frgn XXH64(data: Int, len: Int, seed: Int) -> Int ;

let N: Int = __get_env_int("BOUND");   // runtime-determined — prevents precomputation
let done: Int = 0;
let result: Int = 0;

rct txn compute [done < N][done == N] {
    [done == N - 1] {
        &result = XXH64(addr, len, 0);
        term! -> __print_int(result);   // program exit, swan song runs before ret
    };
    &done = done + 1;
    term;
};
```

**Every tier (interpreter, LLVM backend) must handle `term! -> swan_song` identically.**
If adding a new backend, implement `Statement::TermBang` with swan song as a blocker
before the backend ships — it is the canonical way to produce observable terminal output.

## Benchmark Philosophy

See `docs/architecture/benchmark-strategy.md` for the full benchmark design —
tag system, size-gated detection, correctness verification, and tagging
conventions. This section summarizes the key rules.

### Benchmarks test semantic goals, not syntactic features

Brief benchmarks answer: **"Can Brief compute X with competitive performance vs C?"** — not "Does Brief have feature Y?" Implement the semantic goal using Brief's idioms, not a line-by-line port.

### Benchmarks exist to find flaws in Brief

A benchmark that fails (won't compile, hangs, wrong output) tells you something is missing. A benchmark that is "too good to be true" (0.001s for real work) tells you the compiler folded your dead code. Both are diagnostic signals.

If Brief beats C by an implausible margin, suspect the C reference has been hobbled (volatile, unused return). Fix the C reference — the only valid victory is symmetric, structurally-live programs.

### When a benchmark can't be implemented as-is: find the isomorphism

| C pattern | Brief-idiomatic equivalent |
|-----------|---------------------------|
| `malloc` + pointer navigation | Contract-proven struct arrays + index traversal |
| `double u[N]` (runtime-sized) | Contract-proven compile-time bound + `<-` push |
| `HashMap<String, Int>` | Integer-encoded keys + flat field lookup |
| `for (i=0; i<N; i++)` loop | Convergent contract `[count < N][count == N]` + straight-line body |
| `while (true)` + `break` | Reactive transaction with natural death |
| Recursive `enum Tree` | Flat struct pool with index navigation |

### Each benchmark teaches one compiler lesson

| Benchmark | Lesson |
|-----------|--------|
| fasta | FFI output in hot loop prevents fold elimination |
| fannkuch-redux | 12-field rotation exercises SROA scalar decomposition |
| mandelbrot | Complex arithmetic + escape tracking = guarded integer pipeline |
| knucleotide | 64-field guarded dispatch = compiler switch-gen vs C array indexing |
| spectral-norm | Float arrays at contract-proven scale = allocation strategy |
| binary-trees | Struct pool allocation + index-based tree walk = memory model |

### Two benchmark categories — runtime vs optimizer

Every benchmark is tagged as either `--runtime` or `--optimizer` in the harness.

| Category | Tag | What it measures | Criteria |
|----------|-----|------------------|----------|
| **Runtime** | `--runtime` | Throughput of compiled code | FFI call in the hot loop body. LLVM cannot eliminate the loop. |
| **Optimizer** | `--optimizer` | Compile-time folding power | All `const` inputs + no FFI in hot loop. LLVM may eliminate the loop. |

A benchmark cannot be both. If it has no observable side effects in its hot loop, it is an optimizer benchmark — runtime timing is meaningless.

The harness detects precomputed binaries by `.text` size ratio (< 25% of C → `precompute_ok`, skip timing). Correctness (same input → same output) is checked for all benchmarks.

`bash benchmarks/build_and_bench.sh --runtime` to test only runtime benchmarks.
`bash benchmarks/build_and_bench.sh --optimizer` to test only optimizer benchmarks.
`bash benchmarks/build_and_bench.sh --correctness` to verify output only.

### The C reference is symmetric, always

Both get `-O3 -ffast-math` from the same clang. No `volatile`, no unused variables. Any asymmetry is a signal of a missing Brief optimization — fix the compiler, not the C code.

### Useful utilities become standard library functions

When a benchmark produces a general-purpose helper (rolling hash, vector math, frequency counting), extract it into `lib/std/`. Any function designed for a benchmark that could serve as a general-purpose utility MUST be added to `lib/std/`.

### Correct Approach
- Keep contract `[product > 0]` — fix code, not contracts
- `UndefinedForeignFunction("is_digit")` → `import char from "std/char.bv"`
- Import resolver can't find file → fix search path, not interpreter

### Symmetric by Default

Every Brief benchmark must compute the **same output** as its C reference for
the same input. If Brief's idiomatic approach differs fundamentally from C's
(different data structures, control flow, or algorithm), create **two**
benchmarks:

| Variant | Intent |
|---------|--------|
| **Symmetric** (`_sym`) | Mirrors C step-for-step using Brief features. Answers: "Given the same algorithm, does Brief's throughput match C's?" |
| **Idiomatic** (`_idio`) | Uses Brief-native patterns (contract-proven loops, reactive transactions) for the same semantic result. Answers: "Can Brief's optimizer find a better path?" |

Both must produce identical output for the same input. Neither claims to be
the single "fair" comparison. When fixing a broken benchmark (wrong output,
wrong algorithm), fix the bug — do not split into two variants unless the
approaches genuinely differ.

See also: Hillel Wayne's observation about `queue_drain` — C and Brief
were computing the same result through different algorithms. The fix is
not to hobble either version but to create a symmetric pair.

### Precomputation is Correct, Not a Bug

If the compiler folds your entire hot loop to `store i64 N, main` is `ret`, **the compiler is right.** It had all information at compile time and correctly precomputed the result.

This happens when the loop bound is compile-time known (e.g., `const N: Int = 10` or a fixed-size list literal `[1..10]`). The compiler proves the bound within the `--optimize-budget` and precomputes all iterations.

**Fighting precomputation is wrong.** Do not:
- Add `x == x` self-references to force liveness
- Add synthetic exit-condition fields
- Add `#!exit` conditions referencing dead fields
- Complain that `main` is just `ret`

**If a benchmark must run at runtime**, make the bound runtime-determined:

```
let N: Int = __get_env_int("BOUND");      // ✓ runtime — not precomputable
const N: Int = 50000000;                   // ✗ compile-time — precomputable
```

The `--optimize-budget` flag controls how many transactions the compiler will simulate. Default is 256. Bounds below the budget are precomputed; bounds above emit a runtime loop.

If the compiler precomputes your benchmark, **increase the budget or make the bound runtime-determined.** Never weaken the contract or add hacks. The system works as designed.

## Language Architecture

Brief is a **general-purpose programming language**. The computational primitive is the **reactive transaction** (`rct txn`):
- **Precondition** (guard): `[x > 0 && y < N]`
- **Postcondition** (contract): `[x == N]`
- **Body**: `{ &x = x + 1; &y = y * 2; }`

Loops are transactions with bounded convergence. Recursion is a transaction chain with proved termination. Every optimization (purity folding, dead-field elimination, SROA, SLP) applies because contracts give the compiler enough information.

### Misconceptions to Avoid

| Wrong | Correct |
|-------|---------|
| "Brief is a reactive state machine DSL" | Brief is general-purpose. Transactions ARE loops, iteration, and recursion. |
| "Brief has no arrays/strings/collections" | Interpreter supports `List<T>`, `String`, `HashMap`, `HashSet`, `Stack`, `Queue`, `StringBuilder`. Stdlib has 26 modules. |
| "Brief can't do tree/heap benchmarks" | Interpreter supports recursive enums, structs, field access, match. |
| "Brief needs malloc/FFI for buffers" | Compiler proves bounds from contracts, allocates accordingly. |
| "The LLVM backend is the language" | Interpreter is the reference. Backend is an optimization pass. |

### Two-Layer Architecture

1. **Interpreter** — reference implementation. Validates EVERYTHING before any codegen.
2. **LLVM Backend** — compiles to LLVM IR with optimizations. Never weakens existing optimization paths.

## Interpreter Completeness

### Expressions — Except where noted, all fully implemented
| Status | Variants |
|--------|----------|
| ✅ | Integer, Float, String, Char, Bool, Term, Identifier, OwnedRef, PriorState |
| ✅ | Add, Sub, Mul, Div, Mod, Eq, Ne, Lt, Le, Gt, Ge, Or, And, Not |
| ✅ | Neg, BitNot, BitAnd, BitOr, BitXor, Shl, Shr |
| ✅ | Call, ListLiteral, ListIndex, Projection (18 targets), FieldAccess |
| ✅ | StructInstance, ObjectLiteral, PatternMatch, Concat |
| ✅ | Slice, MultiSlice, Block, Tuple, TupleDestructure, Cast, Match |
| ✅ | ArrowMut, ArrowDiscard, ArrowTransfer (dispatch on Value type, not string names) |
| ✅ | MapLiteral, SetLiteral (evaluate to Value::HashMap, Value::HashSet) |
| ⚠️ | **ForAll, Exists** — FULLY REMOVED from AST, parser, lexer, and all match arms. |

### Statements — All fully implemented
Assignment, Let, InlineAsm, Expression, Term (with optional swan song), TermBang (with optional swan song), Escape, Guarded, Unification, LocalTrigger, SyncBlock.

### Known Gaps
- **Recursive defn calls**: No recursion guard or stack depth limit. Deep recursion overflows the Rust interpreter.
- **ForAll/Exists**: Removed from surface syntax.
- **Interpreter built-in method dispatch**: `dispatch_method_by_type` still matches on function name strings. Deferred — should use FFI registry (Path A: register all operations under `"std::HashMap::insert"` etc., resolve through `ffi_name_to_location`).
- **LLVM backend**: Slice/MultiSlice/Tuple/MapLiteral/SetLiteral/ArrowTransfer/projection stubs remain (see Backend Gaps below).

## LLVM Backend Gaps

Additive only — never weaken existing optimization paths.

### Expressions — Stub (Returns 0 or Degraded)
| Expr | What's Missing |
|------|----------------|
| **Slice** | Only handles `start` offset. Missing `end`, `stride`, `mask`, buffer allocation + copy. |
| **MultiSlice** | Returns base pointer unchanged. Missing coordinate-based indexing. |
| **Tuple / TupleDestructure** | No LLVM struct type for user types. Returns 0. |
| **StructInstance / ObjectLiteral** | Returns 0. Missing allocation + GEP + stores. |
| **FieldAccess** | Returns object pointer as-is. Missing GEP at known field offset. |
| **ForAll** | Returns 1 always. Matches interpreter stub. |
| **MapLiteral / SetLiteral** | No LLVM emission. Falls through to `add i64 0, 0`. |
| **ArrowTransfer** | No LLVM emission. Falls through to generic `add i64 0, 0`. |
| **Keys, Values, Contains, Pop, Index projections** | Stubs returning `add i64 0, 0`. |

### Top-Level — Silently Skipped
| TopLevel | Impact |
|----------|--------|
| **Struct** | No LLVM struct type generated. StructInstance/FieldAccess stubs are symptoms. |
| **Enum** | No tagged union layout. Enum constructors work via ad-hoc stack alloca + discriminant prefix. |
| Signature, Import, LinkDependency | Correctly skipped — frontend-only. |

## Key Philosophy for Backend Work

### Never Weaken Optimizations for New Features
Existing optimization paths MUST NOT regress. All additions are additive — new match arms only, no touching existing fold/precompute/dispatch paths.

### The Interpreter is the Source of Truth
If the interpreter produces the correct result, the LLVM backend must compile it. Fix the codegen, never the interpreter.

### Contracts Enable Optimizations
Preserve contract information in codegen so the optimizer can reason about it.

## For OpenCode

1. Read CLAUDE.md and this file for full context
2. Follow Contract-First Philosophy
3. Never weaken contracts - fix code instead
4. Test with `cargo test --lib` before committing
5. Document bugs and root causes in BUGS.md
6. Never add Rust built-ins for things the standard library should provide
7. **No prototyping — build clean**: Every optimization in its proper module. Never inline new analysis into codegen.
8. **Never weaken C benchmarks**: Fix Brief to match or beat C, not hobble C.
9. **Interpreter IS the reference**: Add to interpreter first, then codegen.
10. **Benchmarks on our own terms**: End-to-end results. Features for benchmarks must add language value.
11. **NEVER discard staged or uncommitted work without asking.** The git index (staging area) holds work-in-progress from prior sessions that may be uncommitted but critical. Before any destructive action (`git checkout --`, `git restore`, `rm -f`, `git reset --hard`), inspect everything that will be destroyed. If in doubt, `git stash` instead of discard — stashes are recoverable, `git checkout --` is not. A single `git restore --staged .` followed by `git checkout -- <files>` can erase hours of uncommitted work with no recovery path.
12. **Plan files**: Every plan-driven session writes a `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md` with datetime stamp before starting work. The plan is committed alongside the implementation code.
13. **Architecture docs**: Update `docs/architecture/` in the same commit as structural changes.
14. **Kani**: Add proof harnesses for all new safety-critical code.
15. **Praetor**: Run on new/changed files; verify complexity ≤ 15, lines ≤ 100, params ≤ 6.

## Self-Hosting Pipeline

The Brief-in-Brief compiler lives in `lib/compiler/`. Run via `brief-compiler selfhost <file.bv>`.

**NOT currently being worked on.** Broken at parser level (multidimensional slice bug). Deferred.

**Do NOT add as built-ins**: `is_digit`, `is_alpha`, `is_alphanumeric`, `is_upper`, `is_lower`, `is_space`, `char_to_string`, `None`, `Some`, `Ok`, `Err`. These are in `lib/std/` — import them.

## Optimization Design

See `docs/design/optimization-decision-tree.md` for the full decision tree — precomputation → enum dispatch → async → folded struct-SSA → fallback — and the rationale for each path (phi reduction, SROA pipeline, why struct phis were eliminated, cross-cutting optimizations).

## Critical Context

### Already Done (Don't Redo)
- **Projection operator (`:>`)** — fully implemented, 8 targets (Size, Bytes, Ptr, Alignment, Range, Popcount, LeadingZeros, TrailingZeros, Absolute, BitReverse, Type, Ptr!, Match, Keys, Values, Contains, Pop, Index). `Expr::ListLen` deleted. All stdlib migrated.
- **`<-` arrow syntax** — fully implemented for List, HashMap, HashSet, Stack, Queue via `ArrowMut`/`ArrowDiscard`/`ArrowTransfer`. Dispatch on Value type, not string names.
- **`->` vs `<-` convention** — `->` reserved for return types and swan songs; `<-` exclusively for collection mutation (`&` sigil marks mutated operand).
- **`term -> swan_song;`** (commit action) and **`term!`** (program exit) — both implemented in interpreter + LLVM backend.
- **`#assume_event(name)`** and **`#assume_shape(guard, action)`** — pragma infrastructure in parser, analysis, LLVM.
- **`#` prefix for all directives** — reuses Hashtag/Attribute parsing.
- **Dead-field elimination** — liveness analysis drops stores to unobserved fields.
- **Dispatch-chain collapse** — preconditions evaluate against pre-tick state.
- **Thread pool async dispatch** — portable barrier + auto-inference of conflict-free txns.
- **SLP hazard analyzer** — disables SLP when peak register demand exceeds hardware.
- **Equality saturation** — lightweight recursive simplification (5-pass fixpoint, 9 rewrite rules).
- **Compile-time PGO** — interpreter profiling guides LLVM branch weights.
- **LTO pipeline** — merges `brief_rt.c` bitcode with program IR.
- **MMIO / DBVS / hardware handoff** — address plumbing, schema validation, Vivado XSA extraction.
- **alka/on_exit disabled** — parser paths commented out, code left for future revisit.
- **`__rt_poll()`** — non-blocking event drain at main() entry.
- **Sync domains (Phase 11)** — `sync(domain)` prefix on `txn`/`defn`, `TopLevel::SyncGroup`, `Statement::SyncBlock`.
- **BracketOp (MultiSlice refactor)** — flat `Vec<BracketOp>` replaces `coordinates`+`mask`. Ops: `Coord`, `Mask`, `Stride` in any order.
- **MapLiteral / SetLiteral** — `{"a": 1}` evaluates to `Value::HashMap`, `{1, 2, 3}` to `Value::HashSet`. ObjectLiteral `{field: val}` preserved.
- **Value::Tuple** — true distinct variant. `Expr::Tuple` evaluates to `Value::Tuple`. Tuple destructure handles both `List` and `Tuple`.
- **ProjectionTarget::Index(usize)** — tuple indexing via `pair :> 0`.
- **MultiSlice mask/stride evaluation** — `BracketOp::Mask` and `BracketOp::Stride` ops now evaluated in interpreter. `_` bound as implicit element variable. `Expr::Slice.mask` also implemented. ArrowTransfer filter implemented with same `_`-binding pattern.

### Not a Priority
- Self-hosting pipeline (broken, deferred)
- ForAll/Exists (removed from core syntax)

### Historical Record
All optimization sprints, benchmark timing tables, bug diagnoses, and implementation phases are preserved in `AGENTS_HISTORY.md`.

### Current State
- 902 tests pass, 0 fail
- **trg reactive dirty-flag architecture** complete (Phases 1–6):
  - Phase 1: `DependencyGraph` — variable-level DAG, Kahn's sort, cycle detection
  - Phase 2: `DirtyFlags(u64)` — bitmask with mark/clear/merge/any/none
  - Phase 3: LLVM `@step(%State*, i64)` — volatile trigger loads, dirty-flag recomputation
  - Phase 4: CIRCT backend (`circt.rs`) — HW+Comb MLIR emission, trg→input ports
  - Phase 5: Webstack `step_triggers()` — dirty-signal propagation in generated Rust
  - Phase 6: Removed `__trg_stdin_read` polling; deprecated timerfd/signalfd polling
- **SSA phi dominance** fixed (6 root causes: nested guard predecessor, let_binding_types save/restore, Unification/Match leaks, terminated reset, stale old-value caches)
- **foreach** complete: LLVM loop IR via alloca-based index, `!llvm.loop.vectorize.enable` SIMD metadata, feature file migration to `src/features/stmt/foreach.rs`, docs
- **`?#` proof oracle** complete: AST/parser, interpreter with fuel injection + state rollback + handler, structural recursion checker (P021), all match arms
- **Instruction reordering** complete: read/write set analysis, dependency DAG, Kahn's topological sort ILP optimization
- Three canonical backends: LLVM (native), Webstack (WASM+JS), CIRCT (MLIR→Verilog)
- All other backends are dead code — zero fixes
- Kani: 14 fast-group harnesses proven (2.5s), 96 full-group pass with `--features kani_full`
- Interpreter is the reference — if it runs a program, the backend should eventually compile it
- All additions are additive (new match arms) — never modify existing optimization paths

### Roadmap — Next Work Items

See `docs/plans/2026-06-15-trinity-work-items.md` for the full plan. Summary:

**Critical — officina-cli blockers:**
1. SSA phi dominance — 17 "Instruction does not dominate all uses" errors in `loop_engine.rs` general loop emission ✅

**Core feature — `foreach` completion (AST exists, backends are stubs):**
2. LLVM backend: emit real loop IR (phi indvar, list load, element bind, body, back-edge) ✅
3. SIMD vectorization: wire `check_list_simd_lengths` → `!llvm.loop.vectorize.enable` metadata ✅
4. Feature file migration: `src/features/stmt/foreach.rs` following `sync_block.rs` pattern ✅
5. Documentation: update `statement.md` with LLVM IR and SIMD lowering ✅

**New feature — `?#` proof oracle:**
6. Structural recursion checker (SPARK-style decreasing variant) ✅
7. `?#` AST / parser / desugaring (fuel injection + rollback + handler) ✅
8. Proof engine dispatch: bounded counter, structural recursion, SMT, fuel fallback ✅
9. Runtime fuel counter + state rollback + handler emission ✅

**Optimization:**
10. Transaction body instruction reordering — reorder for ILP, emit `noalias` GEP annotations ✅

## Iteration Pattern

**Iteration requires `txn` with `[pre][post]` convergence, NOT `defn` + `[guard]`:**

`Statement::Guarded` is a **one-shot conditional** — it evaluates the guard once and executes the body zero or one times. It does NOT loop. A `defn` body executes as a straight-line sequence with no implicit transaction wrapping.

The correct pattern for iteration in Brief is a **callable `txn`** (not `rct txn`). A regular `txn` takes parameters and returns values like a `defn`, but its body executes in a convergence loop: evaluate precondition → execute body → check postcondition → repeat if precondition still holds. The precondition becoming false is the convergence signal.

```brief
// CORRECT — convergence loop via txn + [pre][post]:
txn iter_map<T, U>(list: List<T>, f: T -> U, result: List<U>, i: Int)
    [i < list :> Size][i == list :> Size] -> List<U>
{
    &result = result.append(f(list[i]));
    &i = i + 1;
    term result;
};

defn iter_map<T, U>(list: List<T>, f: T -> U) -> List<U> {
    term iter_map_loop(list, f, [], 0);
};
```

| Construct | Semantics | When to use |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| `defn` | Pure function, straight-line | Stateless computations, wrappers |
| `txn params [pre][post] -> Ret { body }` | Callable convergent loop | Iteration, accumulation, recursion |
| `rct txn [pre][post] { body }` | Reactive, reactor-driven | State machines, event-driven |
| `[guard] { body }` | One-shot conditional | If/else, conditional execution inside a `txn` body |

Evolution: The old pattern `[guard] { &i = i + 1; }` inside `defn` bodies was cargo-culted from `rct txn` internals, where the outer reactor loop provides convergence. But `defn` has no such loop — the guarded statement fires once and falls through. ~130 defns in `lib/` were silently broken. All have been migrated to callable `txn`s.

## Testing Mandate

**Every new feature, every code path, every match arm must have corresponding tests.** No exceptions.

- **Interpreter changes**: Add direct AST-construction tests in `src/interpreter.rs` that exercise every branch of the new code.
- **Parser changes**: Add source-text parsing tests in `src/parser.rs` that verify the parsed AST structure.
- **Backend changes**: Ensure existing tests still pass (`cargo test --lib`). For non-trivial codegen, add LLVM IR string-assertion tests.
- **Legacy code**: Changing old code paths (destructuring, field access in backends) does not require new tests for each backend — but the compiler must build and all existing tests must pass.

Run `cargo test --lib` before every commit. If a change has no test, it does not exist.

## `--dev` / `--prod` / `--release` Optimization Flags (2026-06-13)

The compiler has three optimization modes with two additional controls:

| Flag | Budget | Simplify | Use Case |
|------|--------|----------|----------|
| `--dev` (default) | 256 | OFF | Fast compilation, development |
| `--prod` / `--release` | `u64::MAX` | ON (`u64::MAX` nodes) | Full optimization, production |
| `--optimize-budget <N>` | `N` | per mode | Override budget (region analyzer) |
| `--simplify-budget <N>` | per mode | ON with cap `N` | Override simplify nodes |
| `--no-simplify` | per mode | OFF | Disable expression simplification |

**Budget**: Controls how many transaction iterations the interpreter will
simulate during precomputation analysis. Lower values compile faster but
may produce runtime loops for large bounds.

**Simplify**: The expression simplification pass (`equality_saturation.rs`)
rewrites algebraic identities (`x+0→x`, `!!x→x`) bottom-up O(n) using a
hash-cons cache. Enabled in `--prod`/`--release`. The `--simplify-budget`
flag caps total nodes processed before bailing out.

**--optimize-budget <N>** overrides both `--dev` and `--prod` budgets.
**--simplify-budget <N>** enables simplify with a node cap regardless
of mode. **--no-simplify** disables it regardless.

Implementation: `main.rs` — flags parsed in `build` and `llvm` subcommands,
passed through `run_build` → `run_llvm_compile`. `--prod`/`--release` also
enable the A005b linearity-memory path when guards aren't provably linear.

See `docs/architecture/features/backend-dispatch.md` for the full dispatch
decision tree.

## Architecture Documentation (Permanent Practice)

Maintain `docs/architecture/` as a living record of the compiler's design.
Updated in the same commit as any API or structural change.

### Directory structure

```
docs/architecture/
  overview.md              # System architecture, module responsibilities, data flow
  features/                # One file per feature group
    literal.md
    call.md
    projection.md
    ...                    # Updated when new features are added
  optimization-pipeline.md # Decision tree, folded loop, SSA, SLP hazard
  backend-strategy.md      # Per-backend design notes (LLVM, VHDL, Webstack, etc.)
  channel-map.md           # Data flow: parse → resolve → desugar → typecheck →
                           #   proof → analyze → codegen
  praetor-log.md           # Running log of diagnostics found/resolved (datestamped)
  kani-harnesses.md        # Inventory of formal verification proofs
  glossary.md              # Brief-specific terminology
```

### Rules

1. Every new feature file (`features/*.rs`) gets a corresponding doc entry when created.
2. **Doc-per-cycle**: Every migration cycle ships its architecture doc in the same commit
   as the code change. The doc is written immediately after the code, while it's fresh.
   No batch documentation phases — they drift from reality.
3. Architecture changes are documented in the same commit that makes them.
4. Praetor violations discovered during development are logged in `praetor-log.md` with
   datetime, file, root cause, and resolution.
5. Any commit that changes an API contract between passes must update `channel-map.md`.

### Coordinator docs

Coordinator files (interpreter, typechecker, parser, proof_engine, backends) get their
own architecture doc as they shrink toward their target size (1,000–2,000 lines). Each
doc explains: how the dispatcher works, what stays centralized, error handling, and
interaction patterns.

### What each feature doc covers

| Section | Content | Length |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Header | Purpose, date added, phase | 2 lines |
| Syntax | Brief syntax for the construct with examples | 10–30 lines |
| Typechecking | How types are inferred/checked | 5–15 lines |
| Evaluation | How it evaluates in the interpreter | 5–15 lines |
| Codegen | Per-backend notes (LLVM, VHDL, Webstack) | 10–30 lines |
| Kani/Praetor | Special considerations | 3–5 lines |

Feature docs target 50–150 lines — compact enough to fit in working memory.

## Formal Verification with Kani

Integrate AWS's `kani` bounded model checker as a permanent part of the development
workflow. All new safety-critical code must include Kani proof harnesses.

### Rules

1. **All new modules** created during the refactor must include Kani proof harnesses
   for any unsafe code, FFI boundary code, or functions with non-trivial safety
   invariants.
2. **Targets**: `ffi/native_mapper.rs` (byte slicing, endian conversion) and
   `reactor.rs` (state rollback, step counter) — the two most safety-critical modules
   today. Expand to all new safety-critical code going forward.
3. **Harnesses** live in `#[cfg(kani)] mod kani_tests {}` blocks at the bottom of each
   module file, co-located with unit tests.
4. **Proof goals**: Prove absence of panics, overflows, out-of-bounds access, and
   undefined behavior under all possible symbolic inputs.
5. **CI-gated**: `cargo kani` must pass before merging.
6. **Coverage requirement**: Every function modified during refactoring must have a
   Kani proof harness, regardless of whether it is "safety-critical." The refactor
   touches code across the entire compiler — Kani verifies that the new routing
   logic, enum variant conversions, and helper methods are correct under all
   possible symbolic inputs. `unsafe`-free code can still overflow, panic on
   `unreachable!()`, or miss edge cases in match arms. Proof harnesses catch these.

### Kani Harness Requirements (never hang again)

A Kani harness MUST only contain:

1. **Pure match dispatch only** — `match self { A => B, C => D }` returning a concrete result
2. **Concrete inputs only** — no `kani::any()`, no symbolic values (they trigger unbounded exploration)
3. **No formatting** — no `.to_string()`, `format!()`, `writeln!()`, string concatenation, or any `Display` impl
4. **No heap allocation** — no `Box::new()`, `Vec::new()`, `String::new()`, `HashMap::new()`
5. **No struct construction** unless the struct has ≤ 3 fields and no heap-allocated fields
6. **No loops or recursion** in the function being verified OR any function it transitively calls

A harness is **unprovable** (will timeout) if it transitively calls ANY function that:
- Converts integers to strings (`.to_string()`, `format!("{}", n)`) — **division loop**
- Formats output (`format!`, `writeln!`) — **allocation + formatting loop**
- Constructs `Box`, `Vec`, `String`, `HashMap`, `HashSet` — **heap allocation path explosion**
- Constructs any struct with >3 fields — **state space explosion**
- Iterates with loops or recurses — **unbounded path exploration**

**Fast group** (`#[cfg(kani)] mod kani_tests`): only provable harnesses per above rules. Runs in <5s.

**Full group** (`#[cfg(all(kani, feature = "kani_full"))] mod kani_full_tests`): anything that relaxes these rules (formatting, allocation, loops). Runs on CI only with `--features kani_full`.

### Reference harness patterns

Fast (provable match dispatch):
```rust
#[cfg(kani)]
mod kani_tests {
    use super::*;

    #[kani::proof]
    fn verify_as_integer_dual_path() {
        let old = Expr::Integer(42);
        let new = Expr::Literal(Box::new(LiteralExpr::Integer(42)));
        assert_eq!(old.as_integer(), new.as_integer());
    }
}
```

Full (uses formatting — `kani_full` feature only):
```rust
#[cfg(all(kani, feature = "kani_full"))]
mod kani_full_tests {
    use super::*;

    #[kani::proof]
    fn verify_literal_format_no_panic() {
        let lit = LiteralExpr::Integer(42);
        let s = lit.format();
        assert!(!s.is_empty());
    }
}
```

## Three Canonical Backends

Only three backends are actively developed. All others are **dead code** —
preserved in tree but receiving zero fixes, zero features, zero attention.

| Backend | Target | Status |
|---------|--------|--------|
| **LLVM** (`src/backend/llvm/`) | Native binary (`.ll` + `llc`) | **Active** — canonical OS target |
| **Webstack** (`src/backend/webstack.rs`) | WASM + JS glue | **Active** — canonical web target |
| **CIRCT** (`src/backend/circt.rs`) | Hardware (`.mlir` + `circt-opt` + `circt-translate`) | **Active** — canonical hardware target |

### Dead Backends — Zero Fixes

The following backends are dead. Do not modify them for any reason,
not even for compilation fixes. If a dead backend fails to compile,
delete its broken code paths or mark them with `#[allow(...)]` —
do not invest time fixing them.

`verilog.rs`, `vhdl.rs`, `c.rs`, `rust.rs`, `cobol.rs`, `x86_64.rs`,
`aarch64.rs`, `wasm.rs`, `tcl_generator.rs`

The only exception: if a change to a shared API (e.g. `Statement::LocalTrigger`
gets a new field or a variant is removed from an enum) mechanically breaks
a dead backend, use `#[allow(unused_variables)]`, match with `_ => {}`, or
`todo!()` with a comment `// dead backend` — do not implement the feature.

## Per-Commit Checklist

Before every commit:
1. `cargo test --lib` — all tests pass
2. `cargo build` — no warnings
3. Run Praetor on new/changed files — verify complexity ≤ 15, lines ≤ 100, params ≤ 6
4. Update architecture docs if API contracts changed
5. **Doc-per-cycle**: If this commit includes a new or migrated feature, write/update
   `docs/architecture/features/<name>.md` in the same commit. Never batch documentation.
6. Log bugs/gotchas in BUGS.md or docs/architecture/praetor-log.md
7. Add Kani harnesses for all newly written or modified functions
