## Technology Stack

- **Language**: Lua (Roblox Luau)
- **Platform**: Roblox

- **Design Pattern**: Object-oriented with manager classes

## Core Game Systems

1. **Multiplayer Support**: Up to 8 players, real-time cooperative gameplay
2. **Wave-Based Combat**: Progressive difficulty scaling, zombie AI with pathfinding
3. **Cure-Crafting Puzzle**: 5 unique components, each requiring 5 pieces
4. **Alliance System**: Team-up mechanics with betrayal options
5. **Weapon & Upgrade System**: Server-authoritative raycast weapons, shop system
6. **Inventory & Resource Loop**: Server-tracked inventory, resource spawns
7. **Dynamic Map Support**: MapManager with zombie/resource spawn points

## Coding Standards

### General Principles

1. **Server Authority**: All game logic MUST be server-authoritative for multiplayer safety
   - Never trust client for damage, currency, cure progress, or alliances
   - Validate all client inputs on the server
   - Use RemoteEvents/RemoteFunctions for client-server communication

2. **Modular Design**: Use ModuleScripts for configuration and reusable logic
   - Keep scripts self-contained and independent
   - Create folders/instances at runtime if they don't exist
   - Use clear manager classes for each system

3. **Modern Lua Practices**:
   - Use `task.wait()` instead of `wait()`
   - Use attributes (`Instance:SetAttribute`) for tagging and simple flags
   - Use `task.spawn()` for concurrent operations
   - Prefer descriptive variable names

4. **Documentation**:
   - Add clear comments explaining what each script does
   - Document how systems interact with each other
   - Reference related systems in comments

### Code Style

```lua
-- Use PascalCase for classes/modules
local PlayerManager = {}

-- Use camelCase for functions and variables
function PlayerManager:getPlayerHealth(player)
    local health = player.Character.Humanoid.Health
    return health
end

-- Use UPPER_CASE for constants
local MAX_PLAYERS = 8
local BASE_HEALTH = 1000

-- Always validate inputs
function PlayerManager:dealDamage(player, amount)
    assert(typeof(player) == "Instance", "Invalid player")
    assert(typeof(amount) == "number" and amount > 0, "Invalid damage amount")
    
    -- Implementation...
end
```

### Remote Event Naming

Use descriptive names that indicate direction and purpose:
- `DealDamage` (client → server)
- `WaveAnnounce` (server → client)
- `RequestAlliance` (client → server)
- `UpdateCureProgress` (server → client)

## Key Configuration Files

- `src/shared/GameConfig.lua` - Game tuning parameters
- `src/shared/ZombieTypes.lua` - Zombie definitions and stats
- `src/shared/WaveConfig.lua` - Wave progression settings

## Important Documentation

Before making changes, consult these files:
- `INSTALLATION.md` - Complete setup guide for Roblox Studio
- `GAME_DESIGN.md` - Game design document and mechanics
- `API_DOCUMENTATION.md` - API reference and system interactions
- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - Implementation details and progress

## Development Workflow

### Phase-Based Development

The project follows a phased development approach:
1. **Phase 1**: Core Loop (GameManager, Spawner, ZombieBrain, Waves)
2. **Phase 2**: Weapons & Damage (Raycast weapons, kill rewards)
3. **Phase 3**: Cure System (CureService, puzzle interactions)
4. **Phase 4**: Alliances (AllianceService, UI interactions)
5. **Phase 5**: Polish & Balancing (Tuning, sounds, UI improvements)

### Testing in Roblox

- Changes must be tested in Roblox Studio
- Test in multiplayer mode when possible
- Verify server-client synchronization
- Check for exploits and validation gaps

## Common Patterns

### Creating a Manager Script

```lua
local ManagerName = {}
ManagerName.__index = ManagerName

-- Dependencies
local ReplicatedStorage = game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage")
local Config = require(ReplicatedStorage.Shared.GameConfig)

function ManagerName.new()
    local self = setmetatable({}, ManagerName)
    -- Initialize state
    return self
end

function ManagerName:initialize()
    -- Setup logic
end

return ManagerName
```

### Remote Event Pattern

```lua
-- Server-side
local RemoteEvents = game.ReplicatedStorage:WaitForChild("RemoteEvents")
local ActionEvent = RemoteEvents:WaitForChild("ActionName")

ActionEvent.OnServerEvent:Connect(function(player, ...)
    -- Validate player
    if not player or not player.Character then return end
    
    -- Validate inputs
    -- Process action
    -- Update game state
end)
```

### Client UI Pattern

```lua
-- Client-side
local Players = game:GetService("Players")
local Player = Players.LocalPlayer

local RemoteEvents = game.ReplicatedStorage:WaitForChild("RemoteEvents")
local UpdateEvent = RemoteEvents:WaitForChild("UpdateName")

UpdateEvent.OnClientEvent:Connect(function(data)
    -- Update UI based on server data
end)
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Never trust client data** - Always validate on server
2. **Rate limiting** - Implement cooldowns for player actions
3. **Sanity checks** - Verify all calculations and state changes
4. **Anti-exploit measures** - Use server-side raycasting for weapons
5. **Data validation** - Check types, ranges, and permissions

## Win/Lose Conditions

**Victory**: Cure reaches 100% completion before base is destroyed

**Defeat**: 
- Base health reaches zero
- All players are eliminated

## Multiplayer Considerations

- Assume multiple players can interact with systems simultaneously
- Use proper locking/queueing for shared resources
- Broadcast important state changes to all clients
- Handle player disconnections gracefully
- Test edge cases with player death/respawn

## When Making Changes

1. **Understand the context**: Review related documentation and code
2. **Maintain server authority**: Keep game logic on the server
3. **Preserve existing patterns**: Follow established code style
4. **Test multiplayer scenarios**: Consider race conditions and edge cases
5. **Document changes**: Update relevant documentation files
6. **Minimal modifications**: Make surgical, focused changes
