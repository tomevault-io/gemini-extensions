## Custom Preset Rule (MANDATORY — Enforced Before All Other Rules)

**Every custom preset MUST populate ALL 33 token categories and ALL ~519 fields.**

- The canonical template is `packages/presets/src/_template.ts`.
- When creating a custom preset: copy `_template.ts` or spread it as a base. Change values, never delete fields.
- No partial presets. If a field exists in `_template.ts`, it must exist in your preset.
- The 33 required categories: `colors`, `typography`, `spacing`, `layout`, `sigil`, `radius`, `shadows`, `motion`, `borders`, `buttons`, `cards`, `headings`, `navigation`, `backgrounds`, `code`, `inputs`, `cursor`, `scrollbar`, `alignment`, `sections`, `dividers`, `gridVisuals`, `focus`, `overlays`, `dataViz`, `media`, `controls`, `componentSurfaces`, `hero`, `cta`, `footer`, `banner`, `pageRhythm`.
- Read `skills/sigil-preset/SKILL.md` before creating any preset.

## Color Rules

- OKLCH for all authored palettes. Use `oklch(L C H)` — L=lightness (0-1), C=chroma (0-0.37), H=hue (0-360).
- At most 3 active colors plus neutrals per preset.
- Rich Black (oklch ~0.08) for dark mode page backgrounds, never pure #000000.
- Five text hierarchy levels: `--s-text`, `--s-text-secondary`, `--s-text-muted`, `--s-text-subtle`, `--s-text-disabled`. Always use the right level.
- Four border levels: `--s-border`, `--s-border-muted`, `--s-border-strong`, `--s-border-interactive`.
- BANNED: Hardcoded hex colors in components. All colors must reference `var(--s-*)` tokens.
- BANNED: Gradients with no material logic. Every gradient must have a reason (glow, light, depth, brand).

## Contrast Rules (WCAG AA)

All presets MUST pass WCAG 2.0 AA contrast requirements. Run `pnpm audit:contrast` before shipping any preset change.

| Pair | Minimum Ratio | WCAG Category |
|------|:---:|---|
| Normal text on background/surface | 4.5:1 | AA normal text |
| Large text (>= 18pt) on background | 3:1 | AA large text |
| UI components (borders, icons, form controls) on background | 3:1 | AA UI components |
| Button text (`primary-contrast`) on `primary` | 4.5:1 | AA normal text |
| Status colors (success/warning/error/info) on background | 3:1 | AA UI components |

Rules:
- `text-muted` on `background` must have >= 4.5:1 contrast ratio in BOTH light and dark modes.
- `text-subtle` is decorative/large text — >= 3:1 minimum.
- `border` and `border-strong` on `background` must have >= 3:1 for visibility.
- When `primary` is light (L > 0.55 in OKLCH), `primary-contrast` MUST be black (`oklch(0 0 0)` or `#000000`).
- When `primary` is dark (L <= 0.55), `primary-contrast` MUST be white (`oklch(1 0 0)` or `#ffffff`).
- Never assume white text on colored backgrounds — always check the contrast ratio.
- The audit script checks 30 color pairs per preset across both modes (930 checks total).

## Typography Rules

- Font triad: display face for headlines only, body face for everything else, mono for code/labels/data.
- Do not let all three compete equally in a single view.
- `text-wrap: balance` on all short headings and marketing copy.
- `-webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased` is set globally — never override to `auto`.
- `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` for all changing/comparative numeric UI (counters, KPIs, prices, dates, timers).
- Avoid Inter/Roboto when creating a new visual language — use the self-hosted PP Pangram collection.

## Spacing Rules

- 4px granularity for component internals (padding, gaps within a component).
- 8px granularity for layout rhythm (section spacing, card grids, page margins).
- Canonical ladder: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 72, 80, 96.
- BANNED: Arbitrary spacing like `37px`, `13px`, `7px`. Every value must be on the scale or derived from a token.

## Structural Band Heights — No Border-Compensation Math In Components (MANDATORY)

When a component renders a horizontal band that aligns to the grid (navbar inner row, banner, divider), its height must INCLUDE the structural border. The pixel math for that compensation lives in the **preset**, never in the component.

**The tokens (defined in `sigil` group, emitted as `--s-*`):**

| Token | Value (default preset, `grid-cell = 50px`) | Formula | Use for |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--s-band-height` | `50px` | `grid-cell` | Single-bordered bands (navbar inner row, release banner). |
| `--s-divider-thickness-sm` | `25px` | `grid-cell / 2` | `<Divider size="xs"\|"sm">` w/ `showBorders` |
| `--s-divider-thickness-md` | `50px` | `grid-cell` | `<Divider size="md">` w/ `showBorders` |
| `--s-divider-thickness-lg` | `100px` | `grid-cell × 2` | `<Divider size="lg">` w/ `showBorders` |
| `--s-divider-thickness-xl` | `150px` | `grid-cell × 3` | `<Divider size="xl">` w/ `showBorders` |

**Why the formulas match:**

All horizontal structural bands, including dividers, advance the layout by exact
multiples of `grid-cell`. Borders are included inside the band via
`box-sizing: border-box`, which avoids cumulative `+1px` drift between adjacent
sections and dividers.

**Do not** add `+1px` to divider thickness. The divider's outer box must advance
by exact full-cell multiples; the 1px borders live inside that box.

**Rail / gutter pattern convention (enforced in `getSigilPatternStyles`):**

The page rail's repeating horizontal-line patterns place the 1px line at the **END of each tile** (the bottom). The flavors:

- `horizontal` — 1 line per `cell` (`linear-gradient(to top, COLOR 1px, transparent 1px)` with `background-size: 100% cell`).
- `horizontal-thin` — **3 lines per `cell`** (instrument ruling, dedalus reticle).
- `horizontal-fine` — **5 lines per `cell`** (denser ruler ticks).
- `horizontal-wide` — 1 line per `3 × cell`.
- The horizontal axis of `grid` follows the same `to top, COLOR 1px, transparent 1px` convention.

For multi-line variants (`horizontal-thin` / `horizontal-fine`), the engine emits a single `repeating-linear-gradient` whose final stop lands exactly on the cell boundary, so even fractional inner stops (e.g. `50/3` for cell=50) render at consistent positions and the bottom-most line always coincides with the next cell line. Without this, browser per-tile subpixel rounding accumulates ~2px of drift per ~13k px scrolled.

With the line at the bottom of every cell:

- For tile N at `[N × cell, (N+1) × cell)`, the rail line occupies `[(N+1)·cell − 1, (N+1)·cell)`.
- A `box-sizing: border-box` band of `height = cell` and `border-bottom: 1px` placed at the top of tile N has its bottom border at `[N·cell + cell − 1, N·cell + cell)` — which is exactly the rail line position. ✓

If the rail line were at the top of each tile (`to bottom`), there would be a fundamental 1px gap: the band's bottom border would land 1px BEFORE the next rail line, leaving a visible misalignment. Always use `to top` (or `to left` for vertical gutters) for these patterns. Any new pattern with a 1px line repeated every cell must follow this convention.

**Hero / section padding:**

When a section's bottom should land on a rail grid line, calibrate the section's `padding-y` token in the preset, not in the component. The default landing-page hero uses `--s-hero-padding-y` (set in `default.ts` `hero.padding-y`) so it can be tuned independently of `--s-section-padding-y`.

**Rules:**

- Components consume these vars directly: `height: var(--s-band-height)`. Use the matching CSS token, not raw `var(--s-grid-cell)` plus inline math.
- BANNED inside components: `calc(var(--s-grid-cell) + 1px)`, `calc(var(--s-grid-cell) - 1px)`, `thickness + 2`, or any `+ 1px` / `- 1px` height fudge. If you find yourself writing one, you're patching what the preset should provide.
- If a band needs a different visual height (e.g. half-cell + single border), add a new `sigil.<name>-height` token in `packages/tokens/src/types.ts` + `tokens.ts`, ship it in `packages/presets/src/default.ts`, and consume `var(--s-<name>-height)`.
- Box-sizing on these bands is always `border-box`, so the token value IS the outer box height.
- The page hero / sections do NOT get pixel shaves like `calc(var(--s-section-padding-y) - 1.5px)` to "fix" rail alignment. If a section appears off-grid, the band, divider, or section padding TOKEN is wrong — fix the token, not the page-level styling.

## Radius Rules

- Concentric rule: outer radius = inner radius + padding. When nesting rounded elements, the outer must be larger by exactly the padding amount.
- Choose one radius family per preset and stay consistent: brutalist (0-4px), structural (4-8px), editorial (6-12px), premium (12-20px), playful (20-28px).
- BANNED: `rounded-lg`, `rounded-xl` Tailwind classes. Use `rounded-[var(--s-radius-md)]` etc.

## Depth Strategy

- Primary structural cue: borders. Grid lines, cross marks, and rail marks make the layout visible.
- Secondary: layered shadows for elevation. Use the `--s-shadow-*` scale.
- Low-opacity edge outlines on images/media: `outline: 1px solid rgb(0 0 0 / 0.1); outline-offset: -1px`.
- BANNED: Fake 3D from stacking drop shadows. BANNED: Glassmorphism on white for no reason.

## Shadow Rules

- All shadows must use token variables: `shadow-[var(--s-shadow-sm)]`, never Tailwind `shadow-sm`.
- Prefer subtle layered shadows over hard borders when the goal is depth.
- Shadow formula for elevated surfaces:
  ```
  0 0 0 1px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.06),
  0 1px 2px -1px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.06),
  0 2px 4px 0 rgb(0 0 0 / 0.04)
  ```

## Border Rules

- All border styles must use `border-[style:var(--s-border-style,solid)]` — never hardcode `solid`.
- All border widths must use token variables: `var(--s-border-thin)`, `var(--s-border-medium)`, `var(--s-border-thick)`.
- Border style is preset-driven: solid, dashed, dotted, double, or none. Components must read the token.

## Motion Rules

- Every animation must have a purpose: feedback, spatial consistency, explanation, or delight.
- If an animation has no purpose, delete it.
- UI animations: under 300ms. Interactive elements: 150-200ms. Larger transitions: 250-300ms.
- High-frequency interactions (command palettes, keyboard nav): ZERO animation.
- Litmus test: will the user see this animation >10 times per session? If yes, make it instant.
- All durations must use token variables: `duration-[var(--s-duration-fast,150ms)]`, never `duration-150`.

### Seven Motion Rules

1. Scale buttons on press: `scale(0.97)` on `:active`. Instant on press, optional short transition on release.
2. Never animate from `scale(0)`. Use `scale(0.93)` minimum.
3. Skip delay on subsequent tooltips — once any tooltip is open, adjacent ones open instantly.
4. Use ease-out for entering/exiting. Built-in CSS easings are too subtle; use custom cubic-bezier.
5. Set `transform-origin` to the trigger's position, not center. Center is wrong for anchored elements.
6. Shorten duration before tweaking easing.
7. Use `blur(2px)` to mask crossfade imperfections.

### Enter/Exit Asymmetry

- Enters are chunked and staggered (60-100ms between sections).
- Exits have reduced travel distance compared to enters.
- Exits are faster than enters.

## Component Token Consumption

Every component MUST read from token CSS variables. Hardcoded values are banned:

| Property | Must Use | Banned |
|----------|----------|--------|
| Colors | `var(--s-*)` | `#hex`, `rgb()`, Tailwind color classes |
| Shadows | `shadow-[var(--s-shadow-*)]` | `shadow-sm`, `shadow-md` |
| Duration | `duration-[var(--s-duration-*)]` | `duration-150`, `duration-200` |
| Border style | `border-[style:var(--s-border-style,solid)]` | `border` (implies solid) |
| Radius | `rounded-[var(--s-radius-*)]` | `rounded-lg`, `rounded-xl` |
| Height (inputs) | `h-[var(--s-input-height,*)]` | `h-10`, `h-12` |
| Navbar height | `h-[var(--s-navbar-height,*)]` | `h-16`, `h-14` |
| Sidebar width | `w-[var(--s-sidebar-width,*)]` | `w-[280px]` |

## Token Architecture (Three Layers)

1. **Primitive**: `color.gray.950`, `space.4`, `radius.12`, `font.display`, `shadow.xl`, `ease.fluid`.
2. **Semantic**: `color.surface.page`, `color.text.primary`, `motion.duration.fast`.
3. **Component**: Only when truly needed: `button.primary.bg`, `card.hero.radius`.

Tokenize: colors, spacing, radii, typography, shadow, blur, border widths, z-index, motion durations, easings. Anything repeatedly hardcoded is a system failure.

## Aesthetic Direction

The Sigil aesthetic: structural visibility inspired by engineering instruments. Grid lines, margin rails, cross marks at intersections make the underlying layout visible as a design element.

### Style Variables (lock before designing any preset)

- Contrast level: low / medium / high
- Depth level: flat / layered / scene-led
- Type voice: engineered / editorial / luxurious / brutal
- Surface finish: paper / glass / metal / grain / plastic / shader
- Motion appetite: restrained / assertive / theatrical
- Density: open / balanced / packed

### Composition Rules

- Hero must have one primary focal object.
- Supporting objects frame the focal point or reinforce scale.
- Repeat a visual angle consistently.
- If using glow, pair it with darkness and empty space.
- Let logos, proof bars, and stats inherit the same spacing logic as the hero.
- A strong motif must repeat with variation, not appear once and disappear.
- Most premium pages are built on restraint, not abundance.

### Things Banned by Default

- Random gradients with no material logic
- Generic centered hero + dashboard + blur blobs
- 3 equal cards in a row for feature sections (use bento, zig-zag, or asymmetric grid)
- Too many font families (max: the triad)
- Pill buttons everywhere with no hierarchy
- Glassmorphism on white for no reason
- Fake 3D from stacking drop shadows
- Inter / Roboto / Open Sans as primary typeface for a new visual language
- Pure `#000000` for backgrounds or text
- AI copywriting clichés: "Elevate", "Seamless", "Unleash", "Next-Gen", "Delve"
- Generic placeholder content: "John Doe", "Acme Corp", lorem ipsum, `99.99%`
- `h-screen` for full-height sections (use `min-h-[100dvh]`)
- Emojis in code, markup, headings, or alt text

> See [taste-enforcement.mdc](./taste-enforcement.mdc) for the complete banned-patterns list with variance dials, creative arsenal, and performance guardrails.

## Accessibility Rules

- `prefers-reduced-motion`: keep opacity/color transitions, remove movement/transform animations.
- Gate hover effects behind `@media (hover: hover) and (pointer: fine)`.
- 44px minimum hit area on touch targets (use Tailwind `before:` pseudo for expansion — see `css-ui-enforcement.mdc`).
- WCAG AA contrast on all text/UI pairs (see Contrast Rules above).
- All interactive components must be keyboard-accessible.
- Focus rings use `--s-focus-*` tokens, never browser defaults.

## Gesture Rules

- Momentum-based dismissal: calculate velocity (`distance / time`). If > 0.11, dismiss.
- Damping at boundaries: the more they drag past the edge, the less it moves.
- Pointer capture once dragging starts (`setPointerCapture`).
- Multi-touch protection: ignore additional touch points after initial drag.
- Friction instead of hard stops.
- See `design-animation-rules.mdc` for full gesture and spring animation guidance.

## React Rules

- Hooks at top level only — never inside conditions, loops, or callbacks.
- Exhaustive dependency arrays — never suppress `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps`.
- `forwardRef` on every component that wraps a DOM element.
- Accept `className` prop on every component for Tailwind overrides.
- Use `cn()` from utils for class merging (clsx + tailwind-merge).
- Named exports, never default exports for components.
- Self-closing components: `<Foo />` not `<Foo></Foo>`.

## TypeScript Rules

- `type` over `interface` unless declaration merging is needed.
- `unknown` over `any`. If `any` is unavoidable, add justification comment.
- Use `satisfies` to validate shapes without widening.
- Import types with `import type`.
- Derive types from values with `as const`.
- Early returns over deeply nested conditionals.
- No ternaries for control flow — only for value selection.
