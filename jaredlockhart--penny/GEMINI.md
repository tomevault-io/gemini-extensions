# CLAUDE.md — Penny Project

## What Is Penny

Penny is a local-first AI agent that communicates via Signal, Discord, or a Firefox browser extension. Users send messages, Penny searches the web through the browser extension, reasons using a local LLM (Ollama by default, accessed via the OpenAI Python SDK against any OpenAI-compatible endpoint), and replies in a casual, relaxed style. It runs in Docker with host networking.

Penny is single-user — a personal assistant deployed locally for one person. Multiple devices (Signal phone, browser instances) connect as different devices of the same user, sharing a single conversation history.

Penny also has an autonomous development team (`penny-team/`) — Claude CLI agents that process GitHub Issues on a schedule, handling requirements, architecture, and implementation.

## Environment Notes

- **Logs**: Runtime logs are written to `data/penny/logs/penny.log`; agent logs are in `data/penny-team/logs/` (not docker compose logs)

## Git Workflow

Branch protection is enabled on `main`. All changes must go through pull requests.

- **Never push directly to `main`** — always create a feature branch
- Create a descriptive branch name (e.g., `add-codeowners-filtering`, `fix-scheduler-bug`)
- Commit changes to the branch, then push and create a PR
- **Use `make token` for GitHub operations** (host only): `GH_TOKEN=$(make token) gh pr create ...`
  - This generates a GitHub App installation token for authenticated `gh` CLI access
  - Agent containers already have `GH_TOKEN` set by the orchestrator — just use `gh` directly
- The user will review and merge the PR

## Documentation Maintenance

**IMPORTANT**: Always update CLAUDE.md and README.md after making significant changes to the codebase. This includes:
- New features or modules
- Architecture changes
- Configuration changes
- API changes
- Directory structure changes

Each sub-project has its own CLAUDE.md — update the relevant one(s).

## Running

The project runs inside Docker Compose. A top-level Makefile wraps all commands:

```bash
make up               # Start all services (penny + team) with Docker Compose
make prod             # Deploy penny only (no team, no override)
make kill             # Tear down containers and remove local images
make build            # Build the penny Docker image
make team-build       # Build the penny-team Docker image
make token            # Generate GitHub App installation token for gh CLI
make check            # Format check, lint, typecheck, and run tests (penny + penny-team)
make pytest           # Run integration tests
make fmt              # Format with ruff (penny + penny-team)
make lint             # Lint with ruff (penny + penny-team)
make fix              # Format + autofix lint issues (penny + penny-team)
make typecheck        # Type check with ty (penny + penny-team)
make migrate-test     # Test database migrations against a copy of prod DB
make migrate-validate # Check for duplicate migration number prefixes
make signal-avatar    # Set Penny's Signal profile picture from penny.png
```

### Browser Extension Development

```bash
cd browser
npm install            # Install dependencies
npm run build          # Build TypeScript + bundle content script
npm run dev            # Build, watch, and launch Firefox with auto-reload
npm run ext            # Launch Firefox with web-ext (no build/watch)
```

`npm run dev` uses `web-ext` with `--firefox-profile=default-release --keep-profile-changes` to run in the user's real Firefox profile. The background script owns the WebSocket connection; the sidebar communicates via `browser.runtime` messaging.

On the host, dev tool commands run via `docker compose run --rm` in a temporary container (penny service for `penny/`, team service for `penny-team/`). Inside agent containers (where `LOCAL=1` is set), the same `make` targets run tools directly — no Docker-in-Docker needed.

`make prod` starts the penny service only (skips `docker-compose.override.yml` and the `team` profile). The watcher container handles auto-deploy when running the full stack via `make up`.

Prerequisites: signal-cli-rest-api on :8080 (for Signal), Ollama on :11434, browser extension for web search.

## CI

GitHub Actions runs `make check` (format, lint, typecheck, tests) on every push to `main` and on pull requests. The workflow builds the Docker images and runs all checks inside containers, same as local dev. Config is in `.github/workflows/check.yml`. Both penny and penny-team code are checked in CI.

## Testing Philosophy

- **Always use `make fix check`**: The only way to run tests is `make fix check 2>&1 | tee /tmp/check-output.txt; echo "EXIT_CODE=$pipestatus[1]" >> /tmp/check-output.txt`. Never use `make pytest`, `make check` alone, `docker compose run`, or any other ad-hoc invocation. Read `/tmp/check-output.txt` to inspect results afterward — check EXIT_CODE first, then grep for FAILED or `error\[` as needed.
- **Strongly prefer integration tests**: Test through public entry points (e.g., `agent.run()`, `has_work()`, full message flow) rather than testing internal functions in isolation
- **Fold assertions into existing tests**: Prefer adding assertions to an existing test that covers the relevant code path over creating a new test function
- **Unit tests only for pure utility functions**: CODEOWNERS parsing, config loading, and similar pure functions with many edge cases are acceptable as unit tests
- **Mock at system boundaries**: Mock external services (Ollama, Signal, GitHub CLI, Claude CLI) but let internal code execute end-to-end
- **Never rely on real timers**: Use `wait_until(condition)` instead of `asyncio.sleep(N)` — poll for the expected side effect (DB state, message count, etc.) with a generous timeout. Fixed sleeps are fragile on slow CI and waste time on fast machines

## Design Principles

- **Python-space over model-space**: When an action can be handled deterministically in Python (e.g., posting a comment, creating a label, validating output), do it in the orchestrator rather than relying on the model to use the right tool. Model-space logic is non-deterministic and harder to test. Reserve model-space for tasks that genuinely need reasoning (writing specs, analyzing code, generating responses).
- **Pass parameters, don't swap state**: Never temporarily swap instance state (e.g., `self.db`) to change behavior. Pass the dependency as a parameter through the call chain. Refactor interfaces to accept parameters rather than mutating shared state.
- **Capture static data at build time**: Data that doesn't change during a session (e.g., git commit info) should be captured at Docker build time via build args and environment variables, not parsed at runtime via subprocess calls.
- **Initialize at startup, not in handlers**: Heavyweight setup (copying databases, creating resources) belongs at startup (entrypoint scripts, Makefile, build steps), not lazily inside message or request handlers.
- **Template method over conditionals**: When a parent class has multiple modes or variants, define building blocks on the parent and let each variant compose them explicitly — no flags or if/else chains. Examples: agent system prompts (building blocks like `_identity_section()`, `_profile_section()`), notification modes (`NotificationMode` subclasses declare tools/prompt/context), preference commands (`ValenceConfig` NamedTuple).

## Code Style

- **Pydantic for all structured data**: All structured data (API payloads, config, internal messages) must be brokered through Pydantic models — no raw dicts. This includes tool call arguments: every `Tool.execute(**kwargs)` must validate through a Pydantic args model (e.g., `SearchArgs(**kwargs)`) as its first line, and return structured Pydantic results where applicable
- **Constants for string literals**: All string literals must be defined as constants or enums — no magic strings in logic
- **Prefer f-strings**: Always use f-strings over string concatenation with `+`
- **Datetime columns for ordering, IDs for joining**: Always use datetime columns (`created_at`, `timestamp`, `learned_at`, etc.) for recency ordering in queries. Never use auto-increment IDs (`id`) to infer chronological order — IDs are for joins and lookups only
- **Always use foreign keys**: Never denormalize by storing copies of data that exists in another table. Use proper FK references (e.g., `preference_id REFERENCES preference(id)`) instead of duplicating column values
- **Short methods (10-20 lines)**: Every method should be roughly 10-20 lines (hard max ~25). Break long methods into named steps via extraction — don't add new abstractions, just decompose
- **Summary method at top**: Every class should have a summary method (after `__init__`) that composes calls to other methods, reading like a table of contents. This gives a bird's-eye view of the class's behavior from the top of its definition
- **Database stores pattern**: Database access is organized into domain-specific store classes (`db.messages`, `db.preferences`, `db.thoughts`, etc.). The `Database` class is a thin facade that creates and exposes stores. Access data via `self.db.messages.log_message(...)`, not `self.db.log_message(...)`

## PR Review Checklist

The canonical, exhaustive PR review checklist lives in [`docs/pr-review-guide.md`](docs/pr-review-guide.md). It's the source of truth for every rule the project enforces — code style, error handling, forbidden patterns, async patterns, testing discipline, prompt engineering. The `/quality` slash command reviews the current branch against it.

The Code Style and Design Principles sections above are the quick reference; the PR review guide is the full rulebook.
