# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

`src/` contains the Rust application code. Keep responsibilities separated:

- `src/cli/` defines Clap command trees, flags, and CLI parsing tests under
  `src/cli/tests/`.
- `src/app/` contains app runtime bootstrap and command handlers. Keep command
  logic under `src/app/commands/` and keep lifecycle concerns in
  `src/app/daemon/`, `src/app/runtime_service/`, and `src/xray/process_mgmt/`.
- `src/app/events.rs` records structured operational events. Event recording is
  best-effort and must not make the primary operation fail.
- `src/app/context/`, `src/app/config/`, and `src/app/paths/` contain
  application bootstrap, path resolution, and command-specific runtime settings.
- `src/config/` contains import, parsing, normalization, and protocol link
  support. Keep external input parsing separate from runtime config generation.
- `src/xray/` contains Xray parsing, generated runtime config builders, and
  process management.
- `src/singbox/` contains sing-box parsing/translation support.
- `src/prober/` contains connection test runners for TCP, ICMP, download,
  upload, and real-delay flows.
- `src/db/` contains database wiring, schema helpers, records, and repositories,
  split across `src/db/database/`, `src/db/record/`, and `src/db/repository/`.
  Keep event persistence in the existing `events` database/repository modules.
- `src/model/` contains shared domain types.
- `src/server/` contains HTTP API routes, auth, response, and server state.
- `src/tui/` contains terminal UI state, views, keymaps, and data adapters.
- `src/support/` contains small shared helpers for decode, GeoIP, cancellation,
  network, time, and URL handling.
- `migrations/sqlite/` and `migrations/postgres/` hold ordered SQL migrations.
- `docs/src/` holds user-facing documentation.
- `packaging/systemd/` holds user-service templates used by
  `xrat daemon install`; `packaging/desktop/` holds desktop entry and icon
  packaging assets.
- `install.sh` installs release archives from GitHub and runs optional first-run
  setup.
- `.github/workflows/` contains CI and release automation, including musl
  release builds, generated man pages/completions, GitHub releases, Docker image
  publishing, and crates.io publishing.
- `Dockerfile` builds the container image published to GitHub Container
  Registry.
- `testdata/` holds local fixtures such as GeoIP data.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

- Prefer common commands from `Justfile` over manually spelling out equivalent
  `cargo`, formatting, test, Docker, docs, or packaging commands.
- `cargo build` — compile the project.
- `cargo fmt` — format Rust code.
- `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` — run the same lint gate used by
  CI.
- `cargo test -q --locked` — run the test suite quietly with the locked
  dependency graph.
- `cargo run -- <command>` — run the CLI locally, for example:
  - `cargo run --` (defaults to the TUI)
  - `cargo run -- init`
  - `cargo run -- import <input>`
  - `cargo run -- list`
  - `cargo run -- show config <config-id>`
  - `cargo run -- show subscription <subscription-id>`
  - `cargo run -- parse <config-id>`
  - `cargo run -- test <config-id>`
  - `cargo run -- scan`
  - `cargo run -- connect <config-id>`
  - `cargo run -- disconnect`
  - `cargo run -- logs`
  - `cargo run -- serve`
  - `cargo run -- tui`
  - `cargo run -- status`
  - `cargo run -- delete config <config-id>`
  - `cargo run -- delete subscription <subscription-id>`
  - `cargo run -- purge`
  - `cargo run -- daemon install --start`
  - `cargo run -- upgrade`
  - `cargo run -- version`
  - `cargo run -- geoip status`
  - `cargo run -- manpage --output <dir>`
  - `cargo run -- completions <shell>`

Run `just fmt ci` before committing.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

Use standard Rust formatting via `cargo fmt` (4-space indentation, rustfmt
defaults). Prefer small modules over large files, and split by capability when
files begin mixing CLI parsing, command orchestration, and domain logic.

Naming:

- files/modules: `snake_case`
- functions: `snake_case`
- structs/enums: `PascalCase`
- CLI flags: long, explicit names such as `--database`, `--include-geoip`, and
  `--format`

Avoid one-letter variable names. Do not add code comments unless they are truly
necessary to explain non-obvious intent or constraints. A short top-of-file
comment in `mod.rs` is acceptable when it clarifies what the module is
responsible for.

## Testing Guidelines

Use Rust’s built-in test framework with `#[test]` and `#[tokio::test]`.

- Keep tests close to the code they validate.
- Prefer focused unit tests for parser/config normalization, CLI parsing, DB
  repositories, and runtime lifecycle transitions.
- Add regression tests when fixing parsing, dedup, scanner, or runtime-session
  edge cases.
- For CLI changes, add or update parser tests in `src/cli/tests/` when behavior
  can be validated without starting external services.
- For repository changes, prefer database tests that exercise both SQLite and
  Postgres paths when the existing helpers make that practical.
- Name tests descriptively, e.g. `parses_list_config_filters`.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

Follow conventional commit style seen in history:

- `feat: add scanner command with cf_scan persistence`
- `feat: complete managed runtime service`
- `refactor: split modules into subfiles`
- `test: expand runtime lifecycle coverage`

Keep commits focused and descriptive. PRs should summarize behavior changes,
mention schema or CLI changes, and include example commands/output when
relevant.

## Release Guidelines

Releases are driven by `.github/workflows/release.yml` and run on pushed tags
matching `v*`.

- Before preparing a release commit, run `just fmt ci`.
- Update the package version in `Cargo.toml`; the release workflow rejects tags
  whose version does not match the tag without the leading `v`.
- Use an annotated or signed version tag such as `v0.3.0`, matching `Cargo.toml`
  version `0.3.0`.
- Do not edit released migrations. Add a new ordered migration for database
  changes that ship after a release.
- Confirm release-facing assets still work when touched: `install.sh`,
  `Dockerfile`, `.github/workflows/release.yml`, packaging files, generated man
  pages, completions, and user docs.
- The release workflow builds Linux musl archives, bundles man pages,
  completions, and desktop assets, creates `SHASUMS256.txt`, publishes the
  GitHub release, publishes Docker images to GHCR, and publishes the crate to
  crates.io.
- Prepare or inspect release notes with `gh` when publishing or validating a
  release, keeping notes focused on user-visible changes, fixes, packaging
  changes, and upgrade notes.
- Release notes come from `.github/RELEASE_NOTE.md` when that file is present:
  the workflow passes it to `gh release create --notes-file`, and its Markdown
  becomes the release body verbatim (replacing the auto-generated commit list).
  Update it before tagging; if it is absent the workflow falls back to
  `--generate-notes`.
- If release automation changes, update docs under `docs/src/` and prefer a
  focused commit separate from feature work.

## Architecture Notes

Keep `src/main.rs` thin and route behavior through `src/cli` and `src/app`.

For new CLI behavior, usually add:

- a new or extended command file in `src/cli/`
- a matching handler under `src/app/commands/`
- repository/model updates in `src/db/` when persistence is required
- documentation under `docs/src/02-cli/` or the relevant feature page when user
  behavior changes
- packaging or installer updates when behavior changes generated service
  templates, Docker images, desktop assets, release extras, self-upgrade, or
  first-run installation flow

Design constraints from current implementation direction:

- Do not persist full root-level Xray JSON in the database; generate runtime
  config on demand from stored normalized data.
- Do not reintroduce config selection state. The old `configs.is_selected`
  column and `select` command were removed; use enabled/deleted config state and
  persisted runtime session state instead.
- Keep managed runtime lifecycle behavior explicit and observable (start/status/
  stop flow, persisted runtime session state).
- Record daemon, runtime, rotation, health, and test events through
  `src/app/events.rs` when behavior should appear in `xrat logs`. These events
  are diagnostic records, so failures to write them should be logged and
  swallowed.
- Keep parser and runtime-generation concerns decoupled so parse/test/scan flows
  can evolve without rewriting CLI glue.
- Keep CLI parsing, command orchestration, persistence, and external process
  control in separate layers. Avoid command handlers that directly parse raw
  subscription formats or manually assemble database rows when reusable services
  already exist.
- Reuse shared CLI output helpers in `src/app/commands/output.rs` and existing
  `--format` conventions (`table`, `tsv`, `json`, plus `csv` where already used)
  instead of adding ad hoc terminal formatting.
- Prefer typed domain records and repository methods over passing raw JSON or
  loosely structured maps between layers.

## Agent Behavioral Guidelines

Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes. Merge with
project-specific instructions as needed.

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial
tasks, use judgment.

### Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:

- State assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them instead of picking silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop, name what is confusing, and ask.

### Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- Do not add features beyond what was asked.
- Do not add abstractions for single-use code.
- Do not add flexibility or configurability that was not requested.
- Do not add error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If a change grows far beyond the requested scope, pause and simplify.

Ask: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

### Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:

- Do not improve adjacent code, comments, or formatting unless required.
- Do not refactor things that are not broken.
- Match existing style, even if you would do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it instead of deleting it.

When changes create orphans:

- Remove imports, variables, functions, and tests that your changes made unused.
- Do not remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

### Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:

- "Add validation" means write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass.
- "Fix the bug" means write or identify a reproduction, then make it pass.
- "Refactor X" means preserve behavior and run relevant tests before finishing.

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:

```text
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria such as "make
it work" require clarification.

These guidelines are working if diffs contain fewer unnecessary changes, fewer
rewrites are needed due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions come
before implementation rather than after mistakes.

## Backlog.md Workflow

This project uses Backlog.md for task and project management.

**For every user request in this project, run `backlog instructions overview` before answering or taking action.**

Use the overview to decide whether to search, read, create, or update Backlog tasks.

Use the detailed guides when needed:
- `backlog instructions task-creation` for creating or splitting tasks
- `backlog instructions task-execution` for planning and implementation workflow
- `backlog instructions task-finalization` for completion and handoff

Use `backlog <command> --help` before running unfamiliar commands. Help shows options, fields, and examples.

Do not edit Backlog task, draft, document, decision, or milestone markdown files directly. Use the `backlog` CLI so metadata, relationships, and history stay consistent.
