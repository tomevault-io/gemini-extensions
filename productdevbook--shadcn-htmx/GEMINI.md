# Agent Guide

This repository builds a **shadcn-style component library for htmx v4 + Tailwind CSS v4**, anchored to **web standards**. The goal is components that work because the platform supports them — no hacks, no userland reinvention of features the browser already ships.

To make that possible, this repo vendors the source code and documentation of the libraries and specs we depend on under `repos/`. **You should read those vendored sources before you write or modify code.** They are not training data; they are the current, authoritative ground truth for this project.

---

## Hard rules

1. **`repos/` is read-only reference material.** Never import from it, bundle it, or copy code out of it into `src/`. If you need something from a vendored repo in our shipped code, rewrite it in our style — don't transplant.
2. **Do not commit changes inside `repos/`.** It is managed by `scripts/sync-repos.sh`. Local edits there will be wiped on the next sync.
3. **Prefer reading `repos/` over recalling from training data.** Your training cutoff predates current htmx v4 and Tailwind v4 details. When the vendored source disagrees with what you remember, the vendored source wins.
4. **No hacks.** If a feature requires polyfills, runtime feature-detection branches, or workarounds for "browsers don't do this yet," stop and ask. This project ships only what the platform supports natively today. Progressive enhancement is fine; emulation is not.
5. **Cite what you read.** When you make a non-obvious decision, mention which file under `repos/` justified it (e.g., `repos/htmx/src/htmx.js:1234`). This lets reviewers verify against the source.

## What's vendored, and when to read each

### `repos/htmx/` — htmx v4 source (branch: `four-dev`)

The htmx v4 development branch. **This is the version we target.** v3 syntax and behaviors are not authoritative here.

- **Read for:** attribute names and semantics (`hx-*`), event names, the request/swap lifecycle, extension API, behavioral differences from v3.
- **Best entry points:**
  - `repos/htmx/src/` — core implementation. `htmx.js` is the main file.
  - `repos/htmx/www/src/content/` — official docs (Astro content). Markdown reference for every attribute and concept.
  - `repos/htmx/www/reference.md` — single-file API reference.
  - `repos/htmx/CHANGELOG.md` — what changed from v3 to v4.
  - `repos/htmx/test/` — behavioral specifications by example.
- **Do not assume v3 behavior.** If you're not sure whether something changed in v4, grep the source.

### `repos/tailwindcss/` — Tailwind CSS v4 source (branch: `main`)

Tailwind v4 with the Oxide engine. CSS-first config (`@theme`, `@layer`, no `tailwind.config.js` by default), new variant syntax.

- **Read for:** v4 directives, default theme tokens, how `@theme` and `@utility` work, plugin authoring, container queries, the new color system.
- **Best entry points:**
  - `repos/tailwindcss/packages/tailwindcss/` — core engine.
  - `repos/tailwindcss/packages/tailwindcss/src/` — implementation of `@theme`, `@apply`, variants.
  - `repos/tailwindcss/packages/tailwindcss/preflight.css` and `theme.css` — what ships by default.
- **Do not write Tailwind v3 config files** (`tailwind.config.js` with `content:` arrays). Use the v4 CSS-first approach.

### `repos/shadcn-ui/` — shadcn/ui source (branch: `main`)

The original React/Radix-based shadcn. **We do not copy its code** (different stack), but we mirror its philosophy and component anatomy.

- **Read for:** which components a "shadcn-style library" should ship, what each component's API surface looks like, accessibility considerations baked into Radix, naming conventions, documentation structure.
- **Best entry points:**
  - `repos/shadcn-ui/apps/v4/registry/` — current v4 component registry. Source of truth for what to build and how to structure each component.
  - `repos/shadcn-ui/apps/v4/content/docs/components/` — per-component docs. Mirror this structure for our docs.
  - `repos/shadcn-ui/packages/shadcn/` — the CLI. Useful if we ever ship our own.
- **Do not copy React code into our htmx components.** Read for *intent and anatomy*, then translate to htmx + server-rendered HTML.

### `repos/mdn/` — MDN Web Docs (trimmed to `web/html`, `web/css`, `web/accessibility`, `web/api`)

The reference for what the platform actually does. Trimmed to the parts that matter for us.

- **Read for:** semantic HTML element behavior, ARIA roles and properties, CSS property/selector specifics, DOM and Web API contracts.
- **Best entry points:**
  - `repos/mdn/files/en-us/web/html/reference/elements/` — every HTML element.
  - `repos/mdn/files/en-us/web/css/` — every CSS property, selector, and at-rule.
  - `repos/mdn/files/en-us/web/accessibility/` — ARIA, WCAG, accessible UI patterns.
  - `repos/mdn/files/en-us/web/api/` — DOM, Fetch, Web Components, etc.
- **When in doubt about a native element or attribute, check MDN before reaching for JS or a Tailwind plugin.**

### `repos/web.dev/` — Google web.dev articles and Learn courses

Modern best-practice guidance from Chrome DX team (Una Kravets, Adam Argyle, Jecelyn Yeen, et al).

- **Read for:** "Learn HTML", "Learn CSS", "Learn Accessibility", "Learn Forms", "Learn Performance" courses. Core Web Vitals. Form best practices. CSS layout patterns.
- **Best entry points:**
  - `repos/web.dev/src/site/content/en/learn/` — the structured Learn courses.
  - `repos/web.dev/src/site/content/en/blog/` — articles on new platform features.
  - `repos/web.dev/src/site/content/en/patterns/` — copy-pastable HTML/CSS patterns.
- **Treat web.dev as opinionated.** It tells you the *recommended* way, but always cross-check with MDN for the *specified* behavior.

### `repos/aria-practices/` — WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices Guide (APG)

The W3C reference for *accessible component patterns*. This is the single most important resource for shadcn-htmx component design.

- **Read for:** keyboard interaction contracts, ARIA role compositions, focus management for every interactive component (combobox, dialog, listbox, menu, menubar, slider, tabs, tooltip, tree, etc.).
- **Best entry points:**
  - `repos/aria-practices/content/patterns/` — one folder per pattern, each with a spec and an example.
  - `repos/aria-practices/content/practices/` — cross-cutting practices (keyboard, focus, structural).
- **Every interactive component we ship must align with the matching APG pattern.** If APG says "Down Arrow moves focus to the next option," that is the contract.

## External references (not vendored)

### WHATWG HTML Standard

The HTML living standard is ~1 GB of git history, so we don't vendor it. When you need the **specified** behavior of an HTML element, parser, or DOM interface, fetch from:

- <https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/> — the multi-page version, friendly for targeted fetches.
- <https://html.spec.whatwg.org/> — the single-page version, definitive.

Prefer MDN for everyday HTML questions; reach for WHATWG only when MDN is ambiguous or you need to cite normative wording.

### Other professional voices

When the vendored sources don't cover a topic, the following authors are worth searching the open web for:

- **Heydon Pickering** — accessible component patterns, `inclusive-components.design`, *Every Layout*.
- **Hidde de Vries** — accessibility and semantics, hidde.blog.
- **Adrian Roselli** — practical ARIA, form controls, table accessibility.
- **Manuel Matuzović** — HTML and a11y, htmhell.dev.
- **Sara Soueidan** — accessible interactive components.
- **Josh W. Comeau** — modern CSS techniques (use sparingly; cross-check with platform docs).
- **Andy Bell / Set Studio** — CSS architecture, intrinsic design, *Every Layout*.
- **Stephanie Eckles** — modern CSS, smolcss.dev, moderncss.dev.

If you cite one of these, link to the specific article — don't paraphrase from memory.

## How to use this material in practice

Before building or modifying a component:

1. **APG first.** Find the matching pattern in `repos/aria-practices/content/patterns/`. That defines the contract.
2. **MDN second.** Confirm the native elements and ARIA attributes you'll need in `repos/mdn/files/en-us/web/`.
3. **htmx third.** Check `repos/htmx/www/src/content/` for any attribute or pattern you're reaching for. Confirm it exists in v4.
4. **Tailwind fourth.** Verify class names and `@theme` tokens against `repos/tailwindcss/packages/tailwindcss/`.
5. **shadcn last.** Cross-check API shape and component anatomy against `repos/shadcn-ui/apps/v4/registry/`.

If steps 1–4 don't justify a feature, **the feature doesn't ship.** No emulating things the platform doesn't support.

## Keeping vendored sources fresh

```sh
# sync everything
./scripts/sync-repos.sh

# sync one or more
./scripts/sync-repos.sh htmx tailwindcss
```

The script runs `git subtree pull --squash` against each upstream and re-applies local trims (htmx media folders, MDN non-web subtrees). It refuses to run with a dirty working tree.
