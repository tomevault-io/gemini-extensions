## orchestra-skills

> This repository is documentation and workflow instructions for AI agents, not an application runtime. It is distributed as a plugin marketplace: the single `orchestra` plugin bundles every skill, and both Claude Code and Cursor install it from the manifests at the repo root (`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, `.cursor-plugin/marketplace.json`). Skills live under `skills/orchestra/skills/` (single source of truth — no generated copies). Shared Orchestra material lives under `skills/orchestra/references/orchestra/`, inside the plugin bundle so a marketplace install carries it along.

# Agent guide — orchestra-skills

This repository is documentation and workflow instructions for AI agents, not an application runtime. It is distributed as a plugin marketplace: the single `orchestra` plugin bundles every skill, and both Claude Code and Cursor install it from the manifests at the repo root (`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, `.cursor-plugin/marketplace.json`). Skills live under `skills/orchestra/skills/` (single source of truth — no generated copies). Shared Orchestra material lives under `skills/orchestra/references/orchestra/`, inside the plugin bundle so a marketplace install carries it along.

## Choose a skill first

| User intent | Skill | Path |
|-------------|-------|------|
| Author a new pipeline YAML | `create-orchestra-pipeline` | `skills/orchestra/skills/create-orchestra-pipeline/SKILL.md` |
| **Fix anything in a pipeline (entry point)** — identify the failing task and cause, then route | `identify-pipeline-error` | `skills/orchestra/skills/identify-pipeline-error/SKILL.md` |
| Fix a dbt task already identified as a dbt code/config issue | `fix-pipeline-dbt-task` | `skills/orchestra/skills/fix-pipeline-dbt-task/SKILL.md` |
| Fix a Python task already identified as a code/dependency/schema issue | `fix-pipeline-python-task` | `skills/orchestra/skills/fix-pipeline-python-task/SKILL.md` |
| Fix an Orchestra-platform/config issue (or repo code fix with no dedicated skill); retry/explain a failure without a merge gate | `fix-orchestra-pipeline` | `skills/orchestra/skills/fix-orchestra-pipeline/SKILL.md` |
| Prepare a fix on a branch, validate, summarize, and stop for approval | `triage-orchestra-pipeline` | `skills/orchestra/skills/triage-orchestra-pipeline/SKILL.md` |
| Downstream symptom with no obvious pipeline error | `triage-orchestra-pipeline` (symptom-first path) | same |
| Set up dbt Slim CI in Orchestra on an existing production pipeline | `orchestra-dbt-slim-ci-setup` | `skills/orchestra/skills/orchestra-dbt-slim-ci-setup/SKILL.md` |

Read the full `SKILL.md` for the matching skill before changing pipelines, opening pull requests, or calling external APIs.

## Reference index

Skill `SKILL.md` files reference shared docs with paths relative to the skill folder (`../../references/orchestra/...`, which resolves to the plugin's `references/orchestra/`). From the repository root, use `skills/orchestra/references/orchestra/`.

| Topic | File |
|-------|------|
| Index | `skills/orchestra/references/orchestra/README.md` |
| YAML authoring schema & validation | `pipeline/yaml-authoring.md` |
| Pipeline pattern examples | `pipeline/examples.md` |
| Failure classification | `pipeline/diagnosis-patterns.md` |
| Remediation actions | `pipeline/remediation-playbooks.md` |
| Past fixes and failure profile | `pipeline/knowledge-store.md` |
| MCP tool names and arguments | `mcp/tools-quick-ref.md` |

## Operating rules

1. **MCP** — Use Orchestra MCP for all operations: listing runs, task runs, logs, artifacts, operations, retries, and reading a pipeline's full definition (`get_pipeline`). The Orchestra MCP server is assumed connected.
2. **Parse input early** — Orchestra UI URLs, bare UUIDs, pipeline aliases, pasted errors, and alert text are all valid entry points; the fix skill documents extraction rules.
3. **Evidence before theory** — Prefer `list_task_run_logs`, `download_task_run_log`, artifacts, and `list_operations` over guessing from status fields alone.
4. **Learning is optional** — Recording fixes is deferred to the calling client's persistent memory; never commit workspace-specific fix history. Add only generic, reusable patterns to `pipeline/diagnosis-patterns.md`.
5. **Triage gate** — The triage skill must not merge to the default branch without explicit user approval (`merge`, `yes`, `approve`, and similar).

## Editing this repository

- Change skill workflows directly in `skills/orchestra/skills/*/SKILL.md` — there is a single skill tree, no generation step. Write skills client-agnostically: describe a capability ("if your client can schedule a wake-up…") rather than naming a specific tool.
- Change shared playbooks and tool notes under `skills/orchestra/references/orchestra/`.
- Adding a skill: create `skills/orchestra/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`; it is exposed automatically by the `orchestra` plugin (no manifest edit needed unless you add a new plugin). Bump the `version` in both `skills/orchestra/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json`. Also add the skill's path to the `skills` array in `.tessl-plugin/plugin.json` and bump its `version` — `tessl-publish.yml` no longer auto-bumps this on every push (see PR #27), so it now needs the same manual bump as the other two manifests or Tessl publishing silently stops reflecting new skills.
- Keep user-facing overview in `README.md` and agent routing in this file.
- Never commit secrets or workspace-specific credentials.

## Out of scope

This repo does not ship the Orchestra MCP server implementation, customer pipeline YAML, or integration credentials. Clone [orchestra-mcp](https://github.com/orchestra-hq/orchestra-mcp) and configure MCP separately.
