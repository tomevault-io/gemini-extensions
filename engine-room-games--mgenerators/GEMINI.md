# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project intent

A Unity package of Roslyn **source generators** plus a Unity project that consumes and tests them. Authoritative intent lives in `docs/Directives.md` — read it before structural decisions. `README.md` is the user-facing pitch and is the closest thing to a spec for the `[Singleton]` / `[Dependency]` semantics.

Currently shipped: `[Singleton]` (with optional interface arg, `[SingletonInclude]`, `[SingletonIgnore]`) and `[Dependency]`. Each generator has a companion analyzer that surfaces misuse as diagnostics.

## Repository layout

Two **independently-versioned** but tightly-coupled trees:

- `src/generators-src/EngineRoom.Generators.sln` — the Roslyn generator project (`netstandard2.0`). Source lives under `EngineRoom.Generators/{Singleton,Dependency,Helpers,Templates}/`. Templates are embedded `.cs.txt` resources, loaded by `Helpers/TemplateLoader`.
- `src/generators-unity/` — Unity 6 project (`6000.4.0f1`, URP). Two roles:
  - `Packages/games.engine-room.generators/` — the **UPM package** that ships to consumers. Contains `Runtime/Singleton/Attributes/*.cs` (the public attribute types, plus `ISingleton<T>`), and `Runtime/Plugins/EngineRoom.Generators.dll` (the built generator, with checked-in `.dll.meta`).
  - `Assets/Demo/Singletons/` — demo + tests that exercise the generators against the package. Two asmdefs: `EngineRoom.Demo.Singletons` (the demo MonoBehaviours) and `EngineRoom.Demo.Singletons.Tests` (NUnit, Editor-only, gated by `UNITY_INCLUDE_TESTS`).
- `tests/generators-tests-2022-3-62/` — a **second Unity project on Unity 2022.3.62** purely to verify the package still loads on the older supported version (README declares Unity 2022.3+).
- `docs/Directives.md` — the non-obvious rules:
  - Templates ship as **embedded text resources** inside the dll (not string literals in code).
  - Placeholders use `%%Name%%` (double percent), e.g. `%%ClassName%%`.
  - When something a generator needs looks reusable, extract it to `Helpers/` **immediately** — don't wait for the second caller.
- `docs/Coding Conventions.md` — naming/formatting rules for **both** generator C# and Unity C#. The ones that bite:
  - Allman braces, always present (even one-liners).
  - Private fields `_camelCase`; serialized private fields `[SerializeField] private`; **no public fields ever** — expose serialized values via `[field: SerializeField]` properties, never auto-properties.
  - File member order: constants → static → events → properties → fields → readonly → ctors → public methods → private methods → Dispose/OnDestroy → destructor → nested types. Within each, public → protected → private.
  - Flags enums: plural name, `1 << n`, `0 = None`. Non-flags: singular, reserve `0` for None/Empty.
  - No `#region`. No abbreviations (except math). `nameof()` for member references; interpolation over concatenation.
  - **Comments are rare** — default to none. Only when the WHY is non-obvious.

## Two halves, one source of truth for attributes

The generator project and the Unity runtime package both need to know about the attribute types (`SingletonAttribute`, `DependencyAttribute`, `SingletonIncludeAttribute`, `SingletonIgnoreAttribute`). To avoid drift, the attributes live **once**, as plain `.cs` in the UPM package under `Packages/games.engine-room.generators/Runtime/Singleton/Attributes/`, and the generator csproj **links them into its own compilation** via `<Compile Include="..\..\generators-unity\Packages\...\*.cs" Link="..." />`.

Consequence: **adding a new public attribute type means adding a new `<Compile Include>` line** in `src/generators-src/EngineRoom.Generators/EngineRoom.Generators.csproj`. Otherwise the generator references it textually only (via constants in `*Constants.cs`) and you lose the `typeof()` safety the csproj is set up for.

`ISingleton<T>` is intentionally NOT linked: it uses static interface members that `netstandard2.0` can't compile. The generator references it textually in templates only.

## Build & run

No top-level build script. Two independent toolchains:

- **Generator:** `dotnet build src/generators-src/EngineRoom.Generators.sln -c Release`. A post-build target (`CopyToUnityPackage`, Release-only) drops the dll into `src/generators-unity/Packages/games.engine-room.generators/Runtime/Plugins/EngineRoom.Generators.dll` automatically. Debug builds do not copy — if you're iterating on the generator and want Unity to pick it up, build Release. After the copy, Unity needs an asset refresh (it usually happens on focus; if not, right-click → Reimport on the dll, or use Assets → Refresh).
- **Unity project:** open `src/generators-unity/` in Unity `6000.4.0f1` (match `ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt` or Unity will silently upgrade). The `.sln`/`.csproj` files in this folder are **Unity-generated** — never hand-edit.
- **2022 compat check:** open `tests/generators-tests-2022-3-62/` in Unity 2022.3.62 to confirm the package still loads/compiles on the older floor.

## Unity source-generator requirements (do not deviate)

Per Unity's [docs](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/create-source-generator.html), the generator project **must**:

- Target `netstandard2.0`.
- Reference `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp` at **`4.3.0`**. Newer versions compile against Roslyn APIs the in-Editor compiler doesn't ship and the generator will silently fail to load. **Do not bump** unless verifying against the Roslyn version Unity actually ships.
- Use `PrivateAssets="all"` on the Roslyn package reference, so analyzer dlls aren't copied into the output (Unity provides them).

The `.dll.meta` checked in alongside the dll captures: no platforms enabled + `RoslynAnalyzer` label. **Do not delete or regenerate that meta** — if Unity writes a default one, the generator stops loading and you get no diagnostics about why.

Templates are embedded via `<EmbeddedResource Include="Templates/**/*.cs.txt" WithCulture="false" Type="Non-Resx" />`. The `WithCulture="false"` is load-bearing: without it MSBuild parses the `.cs` in `.cs.txt` as a Czech culture code and bundles the templates into a satellite assembly instead of the main dll.

## Generator architecture

Each generator lives in its own folder (`Singleton/`, `Dependency/`) with a consistent shape:

- `*Generator.cs` — the `IIncrementalGenerator` itself.
- `*Analyzer.cs` — the companion `DiagnosticAnalyzer` that catches misuse before the generator runs.
- `*Diagnostics.cs` — `DiagnosticDescriptor` declarations (IDs, messages, severities).
- `*Constants.cs` — string constants and `typeof()` references to the linked attribute types.
- `*Info.cs` / `*FieldEntry.cs` / `*AttributeReader.cs` — value types and parsing logic that turn syntax into the data the generator emits from.

Shared utilities go in `Helpers/`:
- `TemplateLoader` — reads embedded `.cs.txt` resources and substitutes `%%Name%%` placeholders.
- `SourceFileBuilder`, `SymbolFormatter`, `SymbolInspector` — emit/inspect helpers reused across generators.

When extending: keep the same file shape, and extract anything reusable into `Helpers/` on first sight (per Directives), not on second use.

## Testing

Tests run in the Unity Editor (NUnit, EditMode). They live alongside the demo at `src/generators-unity/Assets/Demo/Singletons/Tests/`, gated by `UNITY_INCLUDE_TESTS` so they don't ship with player builds.

Run via **Window → General → Test Runner**, or headless:

```
/Applications/Unity/Hub/Editor/6000.4.0f1/Unity.app/Contents/MacOS/Unity \
  -batchmode -nographics -projectPath src/generators-unity \
  -runTests -testPlatform EditMode -logFile -
```

If you're adding tests for a new generator: create a parallel `Assets/Demo/<GeneratorName>/{Code,Tests}/` with two asmdefs (demo + tests), mirroring the Singletons layout. The tests asmdef should reference the demo asmdef plus `EngineRoom.Generators.Runtime`, `UnityEngine.TestRunner`, `UnityEditor.TestRunner`, include only `Editor`, set `defineConstraints: ["UNITY_INCLUDE_TESTS"]`, and `autoReferenced: false`.

## Release flow

Two paired workflows in `.github/workflows/`:

- `release.yml` (manual `workflow_dispatch` from `main`): bumps `package.json` version + `EngineRoom.Generators.csproj` `<Version>` in lockstep, builds Release (which lands the dll in the package), commits to a `release/<version>` branch, opens a PR.
- `tag-release.yml`: on merge of that PR, tags the merge commit `v<version>`.

So **`package.json` version and the csproj `<Version>` must always match** — the release workflow enforces this, and the rest of the build assumes it.

## Conventions worth re-stating

- One MonoBehaviour per file; MonoBehaviour class name **must** match the filename.
- Namespaces mirror assembly namespace + folder structure.
- Don't reach for `var` when the right-hand side doesn't make the type obvious.
- Events: present participle = about to happen (`OpeningDoor`), past participle = just happened (`DoorOpened`); handlers prefix with `On`.
- **Comments are rare.** Default to none. Add one only when the WHY is non-obvious — a hidden constraint, a workaround, behavior that would surprise the next reader. Don't write XML doc summaries that restate the type/method name, and don't narrate what well-named code already says.
