# Auto Skill Bootstrap (always)

## When to run

Run **at the start of any non-trivial task** (anything beyond a simple Q&A), and **again** whenever the user adds new requirements/tech constraints.

## Procedure

## Phases + gating (conditional pre-flight)

The agent must reason about tasks in phases, because “just talking” often becomes planning/spec.

## Default stance: engineering-first

Most tasks in this workspace are software engineering. If the task involves building/changing software (code/config/infra),
the agent MUST prioritize engineering domain coverage first, and treat business domains as additive (not a replacement).

**Engineering triggers (any of these => engineering-first applies):**
- user asks to implement/build/modify code, repo, project, integration, API/SDK/client, service, UI, tests, CI/CD, deploy
- stack/framework/runtime is mentioned or implied (e.g. Next.js/React/TypeScript/Python/Node/.NET/etc.)
- the agent is about to produce a plan/spec that will lead to implementation

**Engineering baseline caps (must be included when triggered):**
- Planning/Spec baseline (Gate A add-on): `web-development` OR (`frontend`/`backend` as applicable), plus `architecture`, `api-design`, `security`, `performance`, `design`, `docs`
- Implementation baseline (Gate B add-on): `code-quality`, `testing-unit`, `security`, plus required stack/domain caps (language/runtime, `frontend`/`backend`, `devops`/`ci-cd`, etc.)

Phases:
- **Exploration**: clarify context and constraints (no decisions yet)
- **Planning/Spec**: produce a plan, spec, architecture decision, or best-practice recommendation
- **Implementation**: change code/configs/infra
- **Verification**: tests, QA scenarios, verification steps
- **Delivery**: CI/CD, deploy, release

**Gate A (Planning Gate)** — BEFORE the agent produces any of the following:
- a plan (ordered steps, milestones, checklists)
- a spec/contract (API, schema, DTOs, error model)
- an architecture decision (stack choice, polling vs webhooks, module boundaries)
- “how to do it correctly” best-practice guidance

The agent MUST run bootstrap for **planning capabilities** and must print them to chat:
- current Phase
- planning caps
- plus any domain/stack caps already known at that point (e.g. `backend`, `marketing`, `python`, etc.)

**Gate B (Implementation Gate)** — BEFORE the agent changes any code/config/infra:

The agent MUST run bootstrap for **implementation capabilities** and must print them to chat:
- current Phase
- implementation caps
- plus the domain/stack caps required to implement (e.g. `backend`/`frontend`, language/runtime, `devops`/`ci-cd`, etc.)

**Required chat output (no skipping):**
- `Phases:` list of phases the agent expects to touch (at least Planning/Spec vs Implementation is required).
- `Selected capabilities:` full list to be passed to bootstrap (and/or `other` queries).
- `Bootstrap result summary:` a short summary from `.cursor/skills/auto-skill-bootstrap/state.json`:
  - `caps`, `missing_caps`, `non_allowlisted_only_caps`, `no_candidates_caps`, and whether `adhoc_queries` are in use.

**User choice UX (mandatory):**
- If the agent needs the user to **choose** between options, it MUST use the built-in multi-choice form (tool AskQuestion), not free-form text.
- The choice UI MUST ALWAYS be **multi-select** (even if a single option would normally be sufficient), so the user can select multiple skills when appropriate.
- The AskQuestion **title must always include** a clear marker like `(multi-select)` / `(multiple)` so the user understands they can pick more than one.
- Choices MUST be asked **per capability**, not as a single combined list across multiple capabilities.
- Each per-capability question MUST include an explicit option like `Nothing / install none` to let the user decline. If the user declines for a capability, the agent MUST persist it and MUST NOT ask again for that capability in this task/session:

```bash
python .cursor/skills/auto-skill-bootstrap/bin/auto-skill-bootstrap.py --no-install \
  --cap <cap1> --cap <cap2> \
  --ignore-cap <cap1>
```

1) **Update local skills inventory** (deterministic):

```bash
python .cursor/skills/auto-skill-bootstrap/bin/update-manifest.py
```

**Note on tooling + scope:**
- This workflow uses the **Skills CLI** via `npx skills` (invoked by the bootstrap script).
- Default install scope is **project-local** (no `-g`). Do not use global installs here unless the user explicitly requests global scope.

2) **Pick capabilities** for the task (3–8 max) using:
- `.cursor/skills/find-skills/domains.json` (domain vocabulary)
- `.cursor/skills/auto-skill-bootstrap/capabilities.json` (capability mapping + queries)

**Domain coverage loop (planning + execution):**
- If the plan/execution expands into a **new domain** (new stack, new process area like testing/CI, new business area like marketing/ads), run bootstrap again for the delta capabilities **before** proceeding with that new domain work.
- `domains.json` is a vocabulary/hint, not a hard limit. If the domain does not map well to existing capabilities, use ad-hoc search:

```bash
python .cursor/skills/auto-skill-bootstrap/bin/auto-skill-bootstrap.py --no-install \
  --cap other \
  --query "<domain query 1>" --query "<domain query 2>"
```

3) **Search missing capability skills** (deterministic, no install):

```bash
python .cursor/skills/auto-skill-bootstrap/bin/auto-skill-bootstrap.py --no-install \
  --cap <cap1> --cap <cap2> --cap <cap3>
```

This produces:
- `.cursor/skills/auto-skill-bootstrap/candidates.json`
- `.cursor/skills/auto-skill-bootstrap/state.json`

## EXECUTION GATE (no assumptions, MUST BLOCK)

**Rule:** Until the “candidates decision” is resolved, the agent **MUST NOT**:
- start reasoning about the main task
- propose implementation details
- read/apply code changes
- run web searches
- run any non-bootstrap commands

The only allowed actions during this gate are:
- reading the produced `candidates.json` / `state.json`
- asking the user to approve/decline specific non-allowlisted packages (multi-select)
- installing allowlisted packages per the decision logic below

This gate is an explicit exception to any generic “don’t ask / keep going” guidance: **asking is mandatory** here.

**Soft mode (case 4):** If `state.json` reports `no_candidates_caps` (i.e. suitable skills were not found),
the agent must:
- clearly say that suitable skills were not found for those capabilities
- proceed with the task without installing anything
This does **not** require a user decision and does **not** block progress.

4) **If candidates exist**:
- prefer already-installed project skills first
- if multiple candidates: ask user to choose (multi-select)
- auto-install allowlisted skills, but never auto-install non-allowlisted (ask user explicitly)

### Step 4 (executable): decide + install

After step 3, read `.cursor/skills/auto-skill-bootstrap/candidates.json` and apply this decision logic:

- If allowlisted candidates exist for one or more missing capabilities:
  - Install them automatically (limit installs per capability to avoid over-installing):

```bash
python .cursor/skills/auto-skill-bootstrap/bin/auto-skill-bootstrap.py \
  --install-allowlisted --max-per-cap 1 \
  --cap <cap1> --cap <cap2> --cap <cap3>
```

  - Then refresh the local inventory so the new skills are discoverable in the same session:

```bash
python .cursor/skills/auto-skill-bootstrap/bin/update-manifest.py
```

- If a missing capability has zero allowlisted candidates:
  - Stop and ask the user explicitly whether to install any non-allowlisted candidate packages.
  - If the user approves one or more specific packages, install exactly those (no auto-selection):

```bash
npx skills add <owner/repo@skill> -y
python .cursor/skills/auto-skill-bootstrap/bin/update-manifest.py
```

  - If the user explicitly declines all non-allowlisted candidates, persist the decision (so the agent does not re-ask) by writing state:

```bash
python .cursor/skills/auto-skill-bootstrap/bin/auto-skill-bootstrap.py --no-install --non-allowlisted ignore \
  --cap <cap1> --cap <cap2> --cap <cap3>
```

- If a capability has multiple viable allowlisted candidates and the choice matters:
  - Ask the user to choose (multi-select), then install the selected packages via `npx skills add ...`,
    then refresh manifest (same as above).

## Hard rules

- Never auto-install skills from non-allowlisted sources (`trust-policy.json`). Only install them after explicit user approval.
- Never “install until satisfied”; stop when coverage is good enough to proceed.
