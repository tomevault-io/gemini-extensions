## Agent Quick Start

- Default to `rg` for searching and keep edits ASCII unless the file already uses non-ASCII, especially when touching old .java files, they may contain Chinese logging strings and hardcoded UI strings.

## Project Overview

ZUX-ZTool is an Android/Xposed tool project. The current refactor direction is a UI-layer migration from traditional XML/View/Fragment screens to Jetpack Compose, while preserving Hook, service, utility, configuration, and runtime asset behavior.

The preferred boundary is:

- Refactor UI, navigation, state handling, dialogs, and theme/design-system code.
- Keep `hook/**`, Xposed metadata, module assets, shell behavior, service behavior, existing preference keys, and existing launch entry points intact unless explicitly requested.
- Do not turn the migration into a mixed View/Compose layout swap when a screen contains business logic that should first be separated into state and reusable logic.

## Architecture Direction

Use Compose as the long-term UI layer.

- Use `ComposeRefactor.md` as the detailed migration plan and status log. Before selecting the next migration target, consult the latest plan and verification notes there; keep this file as the concise operating guide.
- `MainActivity` should move toward only hosting `setContent { ZToolApp() }`.
- Screens should become composable screen implementations.
- XML Navigation has been replaced by `navigation-compose`; do not reintroduce XML navigation.
- Existing `settingactivity/**` Activities may be migrated gradually, but new UI should not expand the old one-Activity-per-setting pattern unless compatibility requires preserving an entry point.
- Business pages should consume stable state rather than directly running shell commands, starting raw threads, showing imperative dialogs, or reading/writing preferences inline.
- Phase 7 cleanup may replace temporary Fragment/AppCompat/dialog compatibility wrappers after their Hook or API compatibility target has a stable replacement.

Preferred state shape:

- `ViewModel`
- `UiState`
- `StateFlow`
- Repository/Manager wrappers for shell, logs, config, preferences, update checks, and system services.

For example, logic from `HomeFragment` should be modeled around:

- `HomeViewModel`
- `HomeUiState`
- `EnvironmentRepository`
- `UpdateRepository`

For Phase 7, avoid adding new dependencies on `HomeFragment`; use the replacement Hook compatibility target documented in `ComposeRefactor.md` once it exists.

## Compose And Design-System Rules

Phase 3 is centered on a project-level theme settings model and a component adapter layer. Business screens should stay style-agnostic and consume project components.

Theme settings should be modeled and persisted outside feature screens. The durable shape should cover:

- Frontend style: Material 3 Expressive, Miuix, and future styles.
- Theme mode: follow system, light, and dark.
- Android 12+ Monet dynamic color.
- Manual seed color.
- AMOLED pure black mode.

Keep theme preference keys scoped to app UI preferences. Do not reuse or alter Hook/module preference keys for theme UI settings.

`ZToolTheme` should resolve the final theme from settings:

- Use Monet only when dynamic color is enabled, the device supports it, and manual color is disabled.
- Manual color should derive a complete Material 3 `ColorScheme`, not only replace `primary`.
- AMOLED black should be a dark-theme post-processing step that consistently overrides `background`, `surface`, and `surfaceContainer*`.
- Semantic data colors, such as log severity and user-selected color previews, may remain explicit.

Avoid placing frontend-style conditionals directly in business screens.

Do not scatter code like:

```kotlin
if (style == FrontendStyle.Miuix) { ... }
```

inside feature screens. Instead, prefer project-level UI components and theme adapters:

- `ZToolTheme`
- `ZToolScaffold`
- `ZToolTopAppBar`
- `ZToolNavigationRail`
- `ZToolCard`
- `ZToolDropdownField`
- `ZToolSwitchRow`
- `ZListItem`
- `ZDialog`

Business screens should call project components and let the component/theme layer choose the Material 3 Expressive, Miuix, or future ZUX/ZUI rendering.

Material 3 Expressive should be the first complete and verified style path. Add and wire Miuix only after the Material 3 theme settings path is working for theme mode, Monet, manual color, and AMOLED black. Miuix rendering belongs inside shared components and theme adapters, not in separate business-screen implementations.

Keep these conventions when editing Compose UI:

- Use `MaterialTheme.colorScheme` for normal UI colors.
- Avoid hard-coded background/surface colors unless the color has semantic meaning, such as log severity or user-selected color preview.
- Root screen containers should use the theme background/surface consistently.
- Prefer shared components in `ui/components` over repeated local implementations.
- Route direct Material 3 primitives such as `Scaffold`, `TopAppBar`, `NavigationRail`, `Switch`, `Card`, and dialogs behind shared ZTool components when touching a screen for Phase 3 work.
- Use stable layout dimensions for grids, cards, controls, and rows to prevent text or state changes from shifting the UI unexpectedly.
- For dropdowns, prefer a shared `ZToolDropdownField` using the current Material3 `menuAnchor(type = ExposedDropdownMenuAnchorType.PrimaryNotEditable, enabled = true)` pattern.

## Build System Notes

Compose support requires:

- Kotlin Android plugin
- `buildFeatures { compose = true }`
- Compose BOM
- `androidx.activity:activity-compose`
- `androidx.navigation:navigation-compose`
- `androidx.compose.material3:material3`

Material 3 Expressive is provided through the Compose Material3 family; some APIs may require experimental opt-ins and version pinning based on AndroidX Material3 release notes.

Miuix can be introduced as a Compose UI library. The official project is `compose-miuix-ui/miuix`, with Android dependency forms such as `top.yukonga.miuix.kmp:miuix-ui-android`.

## Migration Rules

When changing UI, navigation, theme, design-system, or Compose migration code:

1. Preserve the original class name, package name, Manifest entry, and external launch contract unless the user explicitly approves a breaking change.
2. Preserve all existing SharedPreferences/config keys used by Hook modules.
3. Preserve root shell behavior, restart scope behavior, and system package names exactly unless intentionally changing the behavior.
4. Preserve Xposed metadata and `assets/xposed_init`.
5. Preserve `assets/embedding/**`.
6. Prefer small, reviewable patches and avoid coupling unrelated screen, theme, and build-system changes.
7. Do not reintroduce XML layouts, XML menus, XML navigation, old adapters, RecyclerView UI, Fragment Navigation, or View-based screen scaffolding during ordinary UI/theme work.
8. After UI, theme, shared-component, or navigation changes, run `.\gradlew.bat assembleDebug`.
9. Document the completed task, verification result, and next step in `ComposeRefactor.md`.
10. When a planned task is completed, update the corresponding task entry in `ComposeRefactor.md`; if the task entry is empty or stale, generate new tasks to push the refactor forward.
11. Commit your changes after documenting them. When committing, include only the current scoped refactor and related documentation. Do not include build outputs, IDE files, Gradle caches, or unrelated untracked files.

## Areas To Preserve

Do not casually refactor these as part of UI migration:

- `app/src/main/java/com/qimian233/ztool/hook/**`
- `app/src/main/java/com/qimian233/ztool/service/**`
- `app/src/main/java/com/qimian233/ztool/config/**`
- `app/src/main/java/com/qimian233/ztool/EnhancedShellExecutor.java`
- `app/src/main/java/com/qimian233/ztool/utils/MagiskModuleManager.java`
- `app/src/main/java/com/qimian233/ztool/utils/EmbeddingConfigManager.java`
- `app/src/main/assets/embedding/**`
- `app/src/main/assets/xposed_init`
- Xposed-related `AndroidManifest.xml` metadata

These may be wrapped behind repositories or state holders, but behavior must remain compatible.

## Phase 7 Compatibility Cleanup

The remaining Compose cleanup may remove compatibility wrappers when replacement targets are in place:

- `HomeFragment.isModuleActive()` may be replaced by a stable non-Fragment Hook target before deleting `HomeFragment`.
- Inactive main Fragment wrappers may be deleted after Hook, route, reflection, and documentation references are audited.
- `AppCompatActivity`, AppCompat `AlertDialog`, and `MaterialAlertDialogBuilder` bridges may be migrated to Compose-owned state/components while preserving public APIs and launch contracts.
- AppCompat or Material Components dependencies may be removed only after source references are gone and `.\gradlew.bat assembleDebug` succeeds.

## Current Follow-Up Priorities

Use `ComposeRefactor.md` as the source of truth for the detailed migration order, rationale, completed work log, and next-step notes.

- Keep all follow-up plans only in `ComposeRefactor.md`.
- Do not record work completion progress in `AGENTS.MD`.
- Keep `AGENTS.MD` stable as an operating guide; update it only for durable workflow rules, preservation boundaries, or project-wide instructions.

## Current Working Branch

The historical refactor notes refer to branch `compose-refactor`. Confirm the active branch with Git before committing.

## Verification Command

Use this command after UI migrations:

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat assembleDebug
```

The command is expected to build successfully even if the known deprecated warnings listed above remain.

If gradle reaches timeout, stop workflow and ask user to manually trigger gradle sync and build in Android Studio for once.
