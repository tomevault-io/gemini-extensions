**Project Vision:** TangleClaw is an open-source, local-first AI-native SDLC orchestration platform. We are building the execution and control plane for fleets of specialized AI agents (Project Managers, Architects, Builders) across the software development lifecycle.
<!-- This repo is governed by the Prawduct Claude Code plugin — see "Governance (Prawduct)"
below, under the PRAWDUCT:ANCHOR marker.

Three owners, and the markers are the boundaries. Everything ABOVE the BEGIN:tangleclaw
marker is hand-maintained and safe to edit, EXCEPT the "Governance (Prawduct)" section under
PRAWDUCT:ANCHOR — that one belongs to the plugin and its doctor check grades on it. Everything
between the BEGIN:tangleclaw and END:tangleclaw markers is written by TangleClaw and replaced
on its next write, so do not hand-edit inside it.

Do not spell either marker in full anywhere else in this file. TangleClaw counts occurrences
before splicing, and a second literal makes the count read as malformed — it then refuses to
write and its block silently freezes at whatever it last contained.

The "Global Rules" section below is a hand-maintained MIRROR of data/global-rules.md, the
file TC injects into every OTHER (non-plugin-governed) project's config. The two are pinned
equal by test/repo-governance-reference.test.js, so edit data/global-rules.md and copy it
here, never one alone. Where a mirrored rule does not hold for THIS repo, the exceptions
section immediately above it is the authority. -->

## Core Rules (Enforced)

- Update CHANGELOG.md with every change
- All functions must have JSDoc comments
- Write tests alongside implementation
- Follow session wrap protocol before ending
- All port assignments go through PortHub

## Extension Rules

- Update docs in same commit as code changes
- Use decision framework before adding code
- Independent Critic review after medium+ work

## This Repo's Exceptions To The Global Rules Below

The Global Rules section that follows is TangleClaw's guidance for the projects it manages, mirrored
here. TangleClaw is itself one of those managed projects, so the rules apply — except where this
repo's own tooling makes them wrong. Each exception below is the authority for this repo; the
mirrored rule stays as written because it is correct everywhere else.

- **Do not tag releases by hand.** The Releases & Versioning rule says to suggest
  `git tag -a vX.Y.Z && git push --tags` after a substantive merge. Not here: `.github/workflows/release.yml`
  creates the tag and publishes the Release as separate steps, so a hand-made tag races the workflow
  and can pin a commit whose `version.json` disagrees with the tag. `docs/release-process.md` is the
  authority on how a release is cut here, and it cites this exception.
- **The post-commit hook is opt-in**, and is not the tagger — see `docs/release-process.md`.

# Global Rules

These rules apply to all TangleClaw-managed projects, across all engines. Edit them from the TangleClaw landing page or via the API.

## General

- Follow the project's existing code style and conventions.
- Prefer small, focused commits over large monolithic ones.
- Keep functions short and single-purpose.
- Write commit messages that explain *why*, not just what.

## Build Plans & Chunks

Some engines store plans in their own global directory (Claude Code uses `~/.claude/plans/`), so plans get lost across sessions and collide between projects.

**Rule: Keep plans local to the project, in TangleClaw's directory — not an engine's.**
- After creating/updating a plan in plan mode, copy it to `<project-root>/.tangleclaw/plans/<name>.md`.
- The location is deliberately engine-neutral: a plan is project state, not engine state, so a project that switches engines keeps its plans. TangleClaw's wrap reads `.tangleclaw/plans/` first and still falls back to a legacy `.claude/plans/` directory where one exists, so existing projects keep working — but new plans go in the TangleClaw location.
- Memory entries and handoffs must reference the project-local copy by **absolute path** — never ambiguous relative paths like `.tangleclaw/plans/...`.
- Don't rely on an engine's global plans directory as the cross-session source of truth.

**Rule: Make plans and design docs openable from anywhere, not just as a local file path.** A local file path can't be opened from another machine, and the operator often reads on a different device.
- **To the OPERATOR:** When you present a substantial plan, design doc, or reference deliverable to the operator, hand them the **shareable hosted link**, never a bare local file path. Published links must use the MagicDNS format (e.g. `https://cursatory.tail123678.ts.net:8443/plans/<projectId>/<file>.md`). Never use engine-hosted artifact links (like claude.ai artifacts); if the operator clicks it, it must be MagicDNS.
- **AGENT to AGENT:** When handing off plans or documents to a peer agent on this host, send **BOTH the hosted link AND the canonical absolute local file path**. Peer sessions cannot read the hosted link because it sits behind an authentication gate; they need the local path to read the contents.
- Keep the **same** link updated in place as the document evolves; don't mint a new link on each edit.
- The project-local file stays the canonical source; the shared link mirrors it.

**Rule: Archive plans whose chunk has shipped.** A plan outlives its purpose the moment its PR merges; leaving it beside active plans makes future sessions treat closed work as ready (the 2026-05-23 failure: recommended a chunk whose issue had closed 18 days earlier).
- When a plan's issue closes / PR merges, **move it to `<project-root>/.tangleclaw/plans/archive/`** (or the legacy `.claude/plans/archive/` if that is where the project's plans still live) rather than deleting — preserves the rationale without polluting the active listing.
- Before treating any plan as canonical, verify its issue is still **OPEN** (`gh issue view <N> --json state -q .state`), even for non-archived files. Archiving is convention; the issue-state check is the contract (it protects across fresh clones, which have no local archive).

## Memory Hygiene

Bridge memos — entries that exist only to span a specific gap (chat-ratified decisions not yet in the plan, in-progress migration context, open-incident notes) — turn into stale canon and mislead future sessions.

**Rule: Bridge memos must self-delete.** When creating one:
- Frontmatter `description` states it is **self-deleting** and names the cleanup criterion.
- The body opens with a prominent "Auto-cleanup check" section: (1) a short mechanical procedure to test whether the bridging condition still holds; (2) if resolved → `rm` the file AND prune its `MEMORY.md` line; (3) if pending → leave it, treat as canonical until ratified.
- The `MEMORY.md` index line signals the self-deleting nature.

When reading a bridge memo at session start, run its cleanup check before trusting it; if it says delete, delete + prune `MEMORY.md` first. This keeps bridging notes resolving into permanent docs (plans, specs, ADRs) instead of accreting as stale background.

## Priming Prompts

When a project grows a recurring "session role" (advisor, on-call review, debugging), save its priming prompt as a durable artifact, not chat memory.

**Rule: Save priming prompts as git-tracked files** at `<project-root>/.tangleclaw/priming/<role>.md` — the verbatim paste block plus a short "How to use", with a dated update history at the bottom so divergence is visible.

## Cross-Session Write Boundaries

When two sessions work related-but-distinct repos (advisor/builder, coordinator/executor), respect repo ownership.

**Rule: Don't write to the other session's repo from yours.**
- The advisor/coordinator doesn't commit to the builder/executor's repo, even when it would be faster.
- Send suggestions via memo-back (a paste-able block) or a shared bridge memo (subject to Memory Hygiene above).
- Either session may edit shared infrastructure (TangleClaw config, ports) — neither owns it.

This avoids merge conflicts, surprise git-log entries, and ambiguity over who owns which commit.

**Rule: Rule Authoring Policy.** The ProjectManager (PM) does NOT author, edit, or rewrite global or session rules. The Builders author and maintain the rules for themselves and the rest of the fleet. If questions arise about rule structure or policy, the Builders consult the Architect directly.
- Any session that finds a missing, incorrect or conflicting rule reports it to a Builder. The PM may coordinate the assignment.
- The shared-infrastructure allowance above excludes rule authoring. Its allowance for ports and other TangleClaw config is unchanged.

## Issues & Feature Requests

GitHub Issues are the canonical place for work outside current scope — searchable, citeable, assignable, and they feed public activity stats.

**Rule: File issues for bugs, deferred features, and open questions — don't bury them in chat or memory.** When something exceeds the current work item, suggest filing before continuing.
- Title `[type] subject`, type ∈ `bug`, `feature`, `chore`, `docs`, `question`.
- Body: what / why / how-to-reproduce (bugs) or expected behavior (features). Use `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` if the repo has them.
- Link from PRs/commits with `Fixes #N` / `Closes #N` (auto-closes on merge).
- Solo projects: file first, close via the PR — the history is the value.

## Branches & Pull Requests

Substantive work goes through a feature-branch PR (even solo) — the PR documents *why* a change happened, it's not just process overhead.

**Rule: Branch + PR for substantive work; direct main commits only for trivial doc edits or incident hot-fixes.**
- Branch names: `feat/`, `fix/`, `chore/`, `docs/`, `refactor/` + `<short-name>`.
- PR titles in active voice ("Add X", "Fix Y when Z"). Body has What / Why / Test plan; link issues with `Fixes #N`. Delete branches after merge.

**Rule: Pair `gh pr create` with `gh pr merge --auto --delete-branch` for routine PRs** (docs, chore, version bumps, dependency updates, test-only) — GitHub then merges server-side the instant required checks pass, no session wait.
- **Use `--auto` for:** doc-only changes (README/CHANGELOG/MEMORY/plans/comments/JSDoc); mechanical chore PRs that don't shift how the project is built; test-only PRs.
- **Don't `--auto`:** anything that triggered a Critic review with unaddressed findings (wait until addressed); PRs touching CI/deploy/secrets/branch-protection; anything the user wants to review first.
- In Auto Mode the default is to enable `--auto` on every PR the session opens, including feature PRs and refactors. Branch protection still gates server-side, so the rule never overrides protection — it only removes the wait once gates clear.
- The merge strategy (merge commit, squash or rebase) is the methodology layer's call — a project's governance sets it, and this file does not prescribe it.
- Branch protection still gates: `--auto` waits for a required review, so it only removes the wait once gates clear — it never overrides protection. If auto-merge isn't enabled on the repo, `--auto` errors; enable it (Settings → Pull Requests) or fall back to `gh pr checks <PR#> --watch` + a manual merge.

## Releases & Versioning

Substantive milestones become tagged GitHub Releases — permanent citeable URLs that feed public activity.

**Rule: Tag with semver and create GitHub Releases with CHANGELOG-driven notes.**
- Semver: MAJOR breaking, MINOR features, PATCH fixes (pre-1.0 may use 0.x freely).
- After a substantive merge, suggest `git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "..." && git push --tags`, then `gh release create vX.Y.Z --notes-from-tag` (or `-F <notes-file>` for curated CHANGELOG notes).
- Keep `CHANGELOG.md` in Keep a Changelog format: each merged PR adds to `[Unreleased]`; releases promote those entries to a dated section.

**Rule: TC's `version-bump` wrap step picks the bump level from `[Unreleased]` content — author entries under the subsection that produces the intended bump.**

| `[Unreleased]` content | Bump |
|---|---|
| `BREAKING:` or `BREAKING(` marker anywhere in body | **major** |
| Any `### Added`, `### Changed`, `### Removed`, or `### Deprecated` | **minor** |
| Only `### Fixed`, `### Security`, or `### Internal` | **patch** |

Rows are evaluated top-down, first-match-wins: a body with both `### Added` and `### Internal` matches **minor** (user-visible subsection wins; `### Internal` never vetoes a real feature). The patch row fires only when no minor- or major-triggering content is present.

`### Internal` (a non-Keep-a-Changelog subsection, added #231) covers refactors, test-only changes, dev tooling, CI tweaks, and doc-only edits — still logged in `CHANGELOG.md` for audit history, but treated as patch-tier so all-internal churn doesn't inflate the minor counter. Pick the subsection by **user-visible impact**, not file footprint: a one-line behavior change is `### Added`/`### Changed`; a 500-line no-user-effect refactor is `### Internal`. In doubt between `### Changed` and `### Internal`, ask "would an operator notice next session?" — yes → `### Changed`, no → `### Internal`.

## Repository Standards

Every repo should look professional to visitors — future-self, contributors, and hiring evaluators.

**Rule: Maintain a baseline of repository hygiene files; suggest missing ones when the project's stage warrants** — real value, not boilerplate spam (a pre-public solo project doesn't need ISSUE_TEMPLATEs yet; a client-facing one does). Baseline: `README.md` (what / why / install / use / status), `LICENSE` (explicit licensing helps even private repos), `CHANGELOG.md` (Keep a Changelog), `.gitignore` (language defaults + project-specific: env files, build outputs, OS noise), `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/{bug,feature}.md`, `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` (checklist + What/Why/Test-plan), and a `main` branch-protection rule (require status checks; require review once contributors arrive).

## Contributor Readiness

When a project is shown to contributors, clients, or hiring evaluators, help flip from solo-project to open-project hygiene.

**Rule: Anticipate contributor readiness; flag gaps proactively when the project signals it's going public** (triggers: "going public" / "bringing in a contributor" / "dev-for-hire showcase" / "portfolio" / about to be unprivated). Readiness sweep:
- README gets a stranger running the project with no prior context.
- LICENSE present and intentional (MIT / Apache 2.0 / BSL / AGPL, matching the commercial stance).
- CONTRIBUTING.md: dev setup, branch/PR conventions, test requirements, code-style expectations, where to file issues.
- CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md if open to public participation (Contributor Covenant is a sensible default).
- CI green and visible (README status badges linking the workflow).
- Recent activity visible — no months-stale main.
- Issue + PR templates present.
- Discoverable from the user's GitHub profile (pin a showcase repo; mention it in the profile README).

Treat the user's GitHub profile as their public portfolio: commit activity, public repos, GitHub Releases, stars, and contributions to others' repos all feed dev-for-hire credibility. Visibility is a feature, not a side-effect — when work crosses a showable milestone, suggest the visibility action.

<!-- PRAWDUCT:ANCHOR — governance pointer managed by the prawduct plugin; keep it small and version-free. -->

## Governance (Prawduct)

This repo is governed by **Prawduct**, a Claude Code plugin; its methodology and
protocols are read on demand via `/prawduct:methodology`.

**Check first: is the plugin loaded?** If `/prawduct:*` commands are unavailable it
is not, and **governance is OFF** — no Stop gate, no Critic, nothing below enforced.
A clone registers the marketplace but installs nothing. Tell the user to
run `claude plugin install prawduct@prawduct`, then restart — don't proceed as if governed.

**With the plugin loaded — before writing any code, STOP and read the build cycle:
`/prawduct:methodology building`.** Skipping it is the #1 governance failure.

Hardest rules:

- **Tests are contracts** — fix the code, never weaken a test.
- **No "pre-existing" exception** — fix what you find, or flag why you can't.
  The fix half is bounded to BLOCKING; below it, the flag is the whole answer.
- **Never silently drop a requirement** — say so explicitly.
- **Run `/prawduct:critic` after medium+ work** — never write findings
  yourself; the independence is the value. Rigor is stage-keyed: a mid-build
  review blocks only on what would ship broken, the review at the merge
  boundary runs everything and is never skipped, and unsure defaults to the
  cheaper mid-build review.

**Enforcement is structural — while the plugin is loaded:** its Stop hook runs at
session end and **blocks** if code changed against an active build plan with no
Critic findings.

## TangleClaw Operational Guide — generated; edits inside the markers are overwritten

**TangleClaw API base URL**: read it from the `TANGLECLAW_API` environment variable your launch exported (`tc whoami` prints it too). It is deliberately not written here: this file is tracked in git and shared by every checkout, while the origin is per install.

- **Run `tc capabilities` BEFORE concluding a capability is missing — never improvise one.** `tc` is normally on PATH in a launched pane (verbs: `whoami`, `capabilities`, `sessions`, `message`, `start`, `freshness`, `ports`, `docs`, `rules`, `learnings`) and reports absence honestly; a capability assumed not checked is how sessions fabricate outcomes. If `tc` is missing, check `TANGLECLAW_API`; a renamed install can break PATH. Use the API with verified launch identity. If context is missing or inconsistent, report it and stop identity-dependent actions — absence of both is unavailable context, not proof of being unmanaged. A failed localhost `tc`/`curl` is **not proof of outage** — sandboxes block loopback; get a host-context check first.

- **Plans are served at a shareable URL.** .tangleclaw/plans/ are served at a shareable URL: GET /api/projects/<projectId>/plans lists each one with the link to hand the operator (tc capabilities shows it with your project id) — hand back that link, never a local file path.

## Medusa Switchboard

- TangleClaw runs your listener — do NOT open your own. Context, not a task: participate when a message arrives or when asked.
- Routes, with `<base>` = `<api>/api/sessions/<project-name>`:
- inbox `GET <base>/medusa/messages`; mark handled `POST <base>/medusa/read` with `{"ids": ["<id>", ...]}`;
- send (initiate or respond) `POST <base>/medusa/send` with `{"to": "<workspace-id>", "message": "..."}`;
- peers `GET <base>/medusa/roster`; why a peer has not picked up `GET <base>/medusa/peers/<workspace-id>`.
- Resolve both placeholders at run time — they are launch facts, not repository facts, and this file is shared by every checkout:
- `<api>` — the `TANGLECLAW_API` your launch exported.
- `<project-name>` — `tc whoami`, or GET `$TANGLECLAW_API/api/tc/whoami?projectId=<id>&workspaceId=<workspace>` with BOTH values from your launch env, URL-encoded. Sending only `projectId` makes the switchboard capability report itself disabled for a session that has it.
- URL-encode the name into the path too: names may contain spaces.
- whoami ECHOES the workspace you claim — it does not validate it. Check that what comes back is the identity you were launched with (`TANGLECLAW_PROJECT_ID`, `TANGLECLAW_WORKSPACE_ID`); if the project id, name or workspace disagrees with your launch env, stop and report it rather than acting on either.
- Never substitute a name read from a committed file, inferred from the directory, or remembered from another session: if it resolves it addresses someone else's queue. If the launch context is missing or inconsistent, say so and refuse rather than guess.
- The INITIATOR closes an exchange, so a message you do not answer leaves the sender blocked. Reply over the same channel rather than printing into your own pane — the sender cannot see it.
- The peer route returns the wake monitor's latest reason code for a peer on this host, with its `meaning` (`local: false` for one it cannot see).

## Port Management (PortHub)

TangleClaw is the central port registry for every project on this machine — register each port here to prevent conflicts. (This replaces the old standalone `porthub` CLI: use the TangleClaw API, not `porthub lease`/`porthub release`.)

### Rules
- **Never hardcode ports** — check and register through TangleClaw first.
- **Register before binding** to a port (dev server, database, API, etc.).
- **Check for conflicts** before claiming a port — another project may already own it. The
  registry now enforces this: claiming a port another project holds returns **409**, it does
  not silently take it. On this machine it also asks the OS: a port with a listener that no
  lease records returns **409 `PORT_IN_USE`** naming the process.
- **Send `host`** when the service is not on this machine. Leases are keyed on `(host, port)`,
  every route defaults `host` to `localhost`, and the same port number can belong to different projects
  on different hosts.
- **Release** a port once it's no longer needed (service stopped, teardown, cleanup).
- **Declare `reach`** when the service is meant to be reachable beyond loopback. A service that
  binds `127.0.0.1` is already stating its intent; `reach` is where another process can read it.
  TangleClaw's Caddyfile divergence check cross-references it, so a proxy fronting a port whose
  owner meant it to stay local is reported rather than silently accepted. A lease with no `reach`
  is treated as `loopback` and never as permission to expose the port.

### Port Ranges Convention
- **3100-3199**: TangleClaw infrastructure (ttyd, server) — do not use
- **3200-3999**: Project services (dev servers, APIs, databases)
- **4000-4999**: Auxiliary services (test runners, watchers)
- **5000+**: Ad hoc / temporary

### Authentication

When the operator has enabled the M2M service-token gate (AUTH-4), every `/api/ports*` call needs `Authorization: Bearer <token>` (else `401`). Where this guide sits in a file the project COMMITS, the live token is deliberately not beside it — fetch it from `$TANGLECLAW_API/api/service-token` (#1619). In an engine-private config TC still injects the header with the live token below this guide. Off by default (no token needed). Rotating the token invalidates the old one — relaunch to pick up the new value.

### API Operations

All calls are JSON. In an engine-private config the API base URL is injected **below this guide**; in a committed carrier it is not written at all — read `$TANGLECLAW_API`, which your launch exported (#1619). Either way use it as-is: its scheme already reflects what the server serves (plain `http://` under `ingressMode: caddy` or with no certificates, else `https://`; don't "upgrade" it). For a mkcert `https://` URL, pass `curl -k` or trust the mkcert root CA.

```
# Check what's taken (before picking a port)
GET /api/ports

# Register a port. Pass "permanent": true to survive restarts (the default over
# HTTP is false — an omitted flag gives you a non-permanent lease).
# "reach" declares how far the service is MEANT to be reachable —
# "loopback" (default) | "tailnet" | "lan". Omitting it means loopback on EVERY
# write, renewals included, so restate a wider reach each time you re-register.
# Returns 201 on success, or 409 if another project already holds the port or an
# unleased process is listening on it. Already started the service yourself? Add
# "adoptListener": true to say the listener is yours.
# "ownerKind": "external" records an owner that is not a TangleClaw project (a
# brew services database); an omitted ownerKind keeps whatever the lease had.
POST /api/ports/lease
{ "port": 3200, "host": "localhost", "project": "my-project", "service": "dev-server", "permanent": true, "reach": "loopback" }

# Register a temporary port (expires after TTL unless heartbeated)
POST /api/ports/lease
{ "port": 4000, "project": "my-project", "service": "test-runner", "ttl": 7200000 }

# Release a port when done. Always send your own "project": ownership is verified
# when present — releasing a port a DIFFERENT project still holds returns 409
# (add "force": true to override). Omitting "project" skips the check. Omitting
# "host" means localhost, and is refused with 400 HOST_REQUIRED when another host
# also leases that port.
POST /api/ports/release
{ "port": 3200, "host": "localhost", "project": "my-project" }

# Heartbeat to keep a TTL lease alive. Send "project" too: renewing another
# project's lease returns 409.
POST /api/ports/heartbeat
{ "port": 4000, "host": "localhost", "project": "my-project" }
```

### When to Register / Release
- **Register** when adding any listening service (dev server, database, API) to a project, or spinning up a temporary test server.
- **Release** when removing a service from a project's config, permanently shutting one down (not just a temporary stop), or when the project no longer needs the port.

### Conflict Resolution

Claiming a port another project holds returns **409** with the current owner:

```json
{ "error": "Port 3200 on localhost is leased by \"other-project\" (dev-server). …",
  "code": "PORT_CONFLICT",
  "owner": { "project": "other-project", "service": "dev-server", "permanent": true } }
```

**Pick a different port in the same range.** That is the answer in almost every case — the
owner in the response tells you who has it without a second call.

A port with a listener but no lease returns **409** `PORT_IN_USE` with the process instead of
an owner (`"listener": { "port", "pid", "command" }`). The same rule applies: pick another
port, unless that listener is your own service, in which case repeat with
`"adoptListener": true`. That flag is separate from `force`, which takes over another project's
lease. `GET /api/ports` lists these unleased listeners as `systemPorts`. A 201 carries
`listenerCheck`, which says what the check found: `clear`, `adopted`, `renewal`, `takeover`,
`not-local` (another host, which this machine cannot see), or `unavailable` (lsof could not run,
so the port was granted unchecked).

Re-leasing a port **your own project** already holds is a renewal, not a conflict: it
succeeds normally, so idempotent re-registration on every boot needs no special handling.
An **expired** lease does not block anyone.

Taking over a live lease requires `"force": true` in the body. It is deliberately explicit
and it is logged with the displaced owner, because the displaced project is still running
against a port the registry no longer says is theirs. Use it only when you know the previous
owner is gone — otherwise release the port from the owning side first.

**Scope of enforcement, precisely.** `lease` is guarded. `release` and `heartbeat` are guarded
**when you name your project** (#656): a mismatch returns 409 with the current owner, just like
`lease`. The check is opt-in because these calls historically took only a port — a request that
omits `project` still releases or renews unverified, so the guarantee holds only for callers that
send their own project (always do). This closes the accidental case — an agent cleaning up after
itself no longer silently releases a neighbor's live port — but it is not authentication: nothing
binds the caller to the project name it sends, so a caller that supplies someone else's project
can still act on their lease. Treat release as the destructive call it is: send your `project`,
and release only ports your own project holds.

## Shared Documents

TangleClaw supports shared documents — markdown files multiple projects can reference or embed in their AI engine configs, organized by **project groups**.

### Groups & Shared Docs

A **group** links related projects (e.g. "backend services"). Each group can have **shared documents** injected into engine configs at session launch, and optionally a **shared directory** (`sharedDir`) whose `.md` files are auto-discovered and registered on launch (filename → doc name, e.g. `NETWORK.md` → "NETWORK"; already-registered files are skipped).

### Authentication

When the M2M service-token gate (AUTH-4) is on, every `/api/shared-docs*` call and a group's `/sync` need `Authorization: Bearer <token>` (else `401`). In a committed carrier the live token is deliberately absent — fetch it from `$TANGLECLAW_API/api/service-token` (#1619); in an engine-private config TC injects it below this guide. Off by default. Rotating the token invalidates the old one — relaunch to refresh.

### Identify Your Project

Send your project binding as two headers on every shared-docs and groups request:

```
x-tangleclaw-project-id: $TANGLECLAW_PROJECT_ID
x-tangleclaw-launch-id: $TANGLECLAW_LAUNCH_ID
```

TangleClaw exports both variables into every pane it launches, whatever the engine. They identify which project is asking: the launch id names your live session, and the project claim must agree with it. They are required: a shared-docs or groups request without them is refused with `403`, and with them you can read and change documents only in the groups your project belongs to — on these routes, another project's group or document answers `404`, as if it did not exist. Changing a document's registration (its file path, name or injection settings) or deleting it, and creating, changing or deleting a group or its members, are the operator's alone (`403 OPERATOR_ONLY`): ask the operator. Editing a document's contents is not a registration change; lock it first. With `curl`, that is `-H "x-tangleclaw-project-id: $TANGLECLAW_PROJECT_ID" -H "x-tangleclaw-launch-id: $TANGLECLAW_LAUNCH_ID"`. A pane with no `TANGLECLAW_LAUNCH_ID` predates launch binding: relaunch the session.

**Send `groupId`** when listing documents, to name the group you mean. Without it the list holds the documents of every group your project is in, never another project's. To find your group's id, `GET /api/groups` lists the groups your project is in.

### API Operations

All calls are JSON and carry the two binding headers above. In an engine-private config the API base URL is injected **below this guide**; in a committed carrier read `$TANGLECLAW_API` instead (#1619).

```
# List docs available to your project
GET /api/shared-docs?groupId=<group-id>

# Register a new shared document
POST /api/shared-docs
{ "groupId": "<group-id>", "name": "NETWORK", "filePath": "/path/to/NETWORK.md", "injectIntoConfig": true, "injectMode": "reference" }

# Lock before editing a document's contents (prevents concurrent edits), then unlock after
POST /api/shared-docs/<doc-id>/lock
{ "sessionId": <session-id>, "projectName": "my-project" }
DELETE /api/shared-docs/<doc-id>/lock

# Re-scan a group's shared directory for new files
POST /api/groups/<group-id>/sync
```

### Lock Etiquette

Lock before editing a shared doc's contents and unlock after, so other sessions can access it. Locks expire after **30 minutes** if not released; sessions auto-release all locks on wrap or kill.

## Session Memory

TangleClaw provides a file-based memory system that persists context across AI sessions. Each project has a `.tangleclaw/memories/` directory.

### How It Works
- **Index**: `.tangleclaw/memories/MEMORY.md` — the entry point; it references any additional memory files.
- **Additional files**: topic-specific `.md` files alongside it (e.g. `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `DECISIONS.md`).

### At Session Start
Read `.tangleclaw/memories/MEMORY.md` to restore prior decisions, progress, open questions, and anything the previous session flagged for you.

### At Session End
Before wrapping, update memory with what the next session needs: key decisions and why, progress on multi-session work, open questions or blockers, and architecture notes or patterns discovered.

### Conventions
- Keep entries concise and actionable; organize by markdown heading.
- Don't duplicate what's already in code, git history, docs, or changelogs.
- Remove or update stale entries — memory should reflect current state.
- Plain markdown, no special syntax required.
