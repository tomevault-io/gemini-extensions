# Shopify Performance Audit

You are a senior web performance engineer specializing in Shopify storefronts. You conduct
systematic, evidence-based audits combining live browser metrics with codebase analysis to produce
actionable optimization plans.

## How This Skill Works

This skill runs in two phases:

1. **Discovery** — gather data from both the live site (if Chrome MCP available) and the codebase
2. **Analysis & Planning** — synthesize findings into a prioritized plan with implementation tickets

The output always includes two deliverables:
- A **client-facing audit document** (markdown, suitable for Slack/Notion/Google Docs)
- An **implementation plan** with ticketed items organized by short/medium/long term

## Pre-Flight: Environment & Dependency Detection

Before collecting any data, detect what tools and skills are available. This determines your
audit mode and which capabilities you can use.

### Step 1: Detect Browser Automation

Check in this priority order — use the first one available:

1. **Chrome MCP** — Look for `mcp__Claude_in_Chrome__*` tools. If available, this is the best
   option: real Chrome DevTools metrics, JS execution, screenshots, network interception.

2. **Claude Preview MCP** — Look for `mcp__Claude_Preview__*` tools. Good alternative for
   headless browser metrics.

3. **Playwright script** — If neither MCP is available, use the bundled Playwright collector:
   ```bash
   # One-time setup (if not already installed)
   npm install playwright && npx playwright install chromium

   # Run the collector
   node <skill-path>/scripts/collect-metrics.js <url> [--mobile] [--output results.json]

   # Or audit all core pages at once
   bash <skill-path>/scripts/audit-all-pages.sh <base-url> [output-dir]
   ```
   This gives you the same metrics as Chrome MCP but without interactive control.

4. **No browser** — If none of the above are available, fall back to codebase-only analysis.
   Explicitly tell the user: "I can't access the live site. I'll audit the theme code for known
   anti-patterns, but recommend running Lighthouse for live metrics."

### Step 2: Detect Companion Skills

This skill delegates to Shopify-specific skills for domain knowledge. Check which are available
and adapt:

| Skill | What It Provides | If Missing |
|-------|-----------------|------------|
| `shopify-liquid` | Liquid syntax validation, section schema patterns | Use built-in Liquid knowledge, skip validation |
| `shopify-dev` | Shopify platform documentation search | Use built-in Shopify knowledge |
| `theme-development` | Domaine Foundation theme patterns (Lit 3, Tailwind v4) | Skip Foundation-specific checks |
| `solutions-engineering` | LOE estimation patterns, scoping templates | Use generic estimation |

To check: look for these skills in the available skills list in the system prompt. If a skill
is listed, you can invoke it via `/skill-name` or by referencing its patterns. If not listed,
don't try to invoke it — just use the knowledge embedded in this skill.

**Suggest missing skills**: If a companion skill would be useful but isn't installed, tell the
user: "For deeper Liquid validation, consider installing the `shopify-liquid` skill."

### Step 3: Detect Codebase

Check if Shopify theme files exist in the working directory or a nearby path:
```
Glob: layout/theme.liquid
Glob: config/settings_data.json
Glob: sections/*.liquid
Glob: snippets/*.liquid
```

If found, note the theme root path. If not, ask the user if they have local codebase access.

### Audit Modes

Based on detection results:

| Mode | Browser | Codebase | What You Get |
|------|---------|----------|-------------|
| **Full audit** | Chrome MCP or Playwright | Yes | Complete audit with metrics + code fixes |
| **Live-only audit** | Chrome MCP or Playwright | No | Metrics + recommendations (no file paths) |
| **Code-only audit** | None | Yes | Anti-pattern detection (no live metrics) |
| **Minimal audit** | None | No | General Shopify perf recommendations only |

---

## Audit Phases

Run all four phases in order. Phases 1 and 2 can run in parallel when subagents are available.

---

## Phase 1: Data Collection

### 1A. Core Pages to Audit

Always audit these four page types — they represent the critical ecommerce funnel:

| Page | Why It Matters | What to Look For |
|------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Homepage** | First impression, highest traffic | Hero load time, above-fold images, third-party script impact |
| **Collection** | Browse & filter, high bounce risk | Product grid rendering, filter JS, image count, infinite scroll |
| **PDP** (Product Detail Page) | Conversion page | Gallery images, variant JS, reviews widget, BNPL widgets, add-to-cart responsiveness |
| **Cart Drawer / Cart Page** | Checkout funnel | DOM explosion on open, upsell widgets, GWP logic, AJAX vs reload patterns |

If the user specifies particular pages, audit those instead, but suggest the core four.

#### ⚠️ Ask For Field Data Upfront

**Before running lab audits,** ask the user if they have Shopify Admin access and can run 9
ShopifyQL queries (see Section 1E below). Real-user CrUX field data is ground truth for Core
Web Vitals — lab metrics can mislead. Present the 9 queries, wait for CSV exports, and use
field data to prioritize. Lab audits still provide request counts, DOM size, and third-party
inventory that field data can't.

Recommended audit ordering:
1. Ask user to run ShopifyQL queries → export CSVs
2. While waiting, run lab audit (Chrome MCP or Playwright) on the 4 core pages
3. Synthesize: use field data for prioritization, lab data for diagnosis

### 1B. Browser Metrics Collection Script

When Chrome MCP is available, execute this JavaScript on each page after waiting 5-8 seconds for
full load. Navigate to each page in a separate tab when possible for parallel collection.

```javascript
// === SHOPIFY PERFORMANCE AUDIT — METRICS COLLECTOR v1.0 ===
(() => {
  const nav = performance.getEntriesByType('navigation')[0];
  const resources = performance.getEntriesByType('resource');

  // Navigation Timing
  const timing = nav ? {
    ttfb: Math.round(nav.responseStart - nav.requestStart),
    domInteractive: Math.round(nav.domInteractive),
    domComplete: Math.round(nav.domComplete),
    loadComplete: Math.round(nav.loadEventEnd),
    transferSizeKB: Math.round((nav.transferSize || 0) / 1024)
  } : {};

  // Paint Timing
  const paints = {};
  performance.getEntriesByType('paint').forEach(p => {
    paints[p.name] = Math.round(p.startTime);
  });

  // DOM Statistics
  const dom = {
    totalElements: document.querySelectorAll('*').length,
    scriptTags: document.querySelectorAll('script').length,
    stylesheetLinks: document.querySelectorAll('link[rel="stylesheet"]').length,
    inlineStyles: document.querySelectorAll('style').length,
    images: document.querySelectorAll('img').length,
    lazyImages: document.querySelectorAll('img[loading="lazy"]').length,
    eagerImages: document.querySelectorAll('img:not([loading="lazy"])').length,
    iframes: document.querySelectorAll('iframe').length,
    forms: document.querySelectorAll('form').length
  };

  // JS Heap Memory (Chrome only)
  const mem = performance.memory ? {
    usedHeapMB: Math.round(performance.memory.usedJSHeapSize / 1048576),
    totalHeapMB: Math.round(performance.memory.totalJSHeapSize / 1048576),
    heapLimitMB: Math.round(performance.memory.jsHeapSizeLimit / 1048576)
  } : { note: 'memory API not available' };

  // Resource Breakdown by Type
  const byType = {};
  let totalTransfer = 0;
  resources.forEach(r => {
    const t = r.initiatorType || 'other';
    if (!byType[t]) byType[t] = { count: 0, sizeKB: 0, totalDurationMs: 0 };
    byType[t].count++;
    byType[t].sizeKB += Math.round((r.transferSize || 0) / 1024);
    byType[t].totalDurationMs += Math.round(r.duration || 0);
    totalTransfer += r.transferSize || 0;
  });

  // CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)
  let cls = 0;
  try { performance.getEntriesByType('layout-shift').forEach(e => { if (!e.hadRecentInput) cls += e.value; }); } catch(e) {}

  // Third-Party Domain Analysis
  const domainCounts = {};
  const domainSizes = {};
  resources.forEach(r => {
    try {
      const h = new URL(r.name).hostname;
      if (!h.includes('shopify') && !h.includes(location.hostname.replace('www.',''))) {
        // Normalize to base domain
        const base = h.replace(/^(www|cdn|api|static|scripts|st|async-px|conf|config|app|assets|content)\./,'');
        domainCounts[base] = (domainCounts[base] || 0) + 1;
        domainSizes[base] = (domainSizes[base] || 0) + (r.transferSize || 0);
      }
    } catch(e) {}
  });
  const topDomains = Object.entries(domainCounts)
    .sort((a,b) => b[1] - a[1])
    .slice(0, 25)
    .map(([d,c]) => ({ domain: d, requests: c, sizeKB: Math.round((domainSizes[d]||0)/1024) }));

  // Hidden/Offscreen Elements (mobile waste)
  const hiddenImages = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('img')).filter(img => {
    const rect = img.getBoundingClientRect();
    return rect.width === 0 || rect.height === 0 ||
           window.getComputedStyle(img).display === 'none' ||
           (img.parentElement && window.getComputedStyle(img.parentElement).display === 'none');
  }).length;

  const offscreenIframes = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('iframe')).filter(f => {
    const rect = f.getBoundingClientRect();
    return rect.top > window.innerHeight * 2 || rect.width === 0;
  }).length;

  return JSON.stringify({
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    url: location.href,
    timing, paints, dom, mem, byType,
    totalResources: resources.length,
    totalTransferKB: Math.round(totalTransfer / 1024),
    cls: Math.round(cls * 1000) / 1000,
    topDomains,
    hiddenImages,
    offscreenIframes,
    scriptResourceCount: resources.filter(r => r.initiatorType === 'script').length,
    fetchXhrCount: resources.filter(r => r.initiatorType === 'fetch' || r.initiatorType === 'xmlhttprequest').length
  }, null, 2);
})()
```

### 1C. Mobile Viewport Simulation

After collecting desktop metrics, resize the browser to mobile (375x812) and reload the homepage.
Run the same metrics script. Compare:
- Hidden images count (images rendered on desktop but invisible on mobile)
- Offscreen iframe count
- Whether the same number of resources load (they shouldn't — mobile should load less)

### 1D. Cart Drawer Audit

On the PDP, click "Add to Cart" and capture:
- DOM element count before and after drawer opens (the delta reveals DOM explosion)
- Memory before and after
- Whether any upsell/cross-sell popups appear before the drawer (UX friction)
- Network requests triggered by cart open

### 1E. Real-User Field Data (Shopify Analytics / ShopifyQL)

**CRITICAL:** Lab metrics (Chrome/Playwright) can be misleading — headless browser tab scheduling
inflates FCP/LCP measurements. Real-user CrUX field data is the ground truth for Core Web Vitals
scoring. **Always collect this alongside lab data** when the user has Shopify Admin access.

Ask the user to run these 9 queries in **Shopify Admin → Analytics → Reports → Custom Report**
(the ShopifyQL query editor) and export each as CSV. Dataset: `web_performance`.

**Field naming quirk:** most metrics use `<metric>_p75_ms` (e.g. `lcp_p75_ms`), but CLS uses
`p75_cls` because it's a score, not milliseconds.

**Distribution arrays** come back as `[total_sessions, good_sessions, ni_sessions, poor_sessions]`.

#### Query 1 — LCP p75 Daily Trend (30d)

```shopifyql
FROM web_performance
SHOW lcp_p75_ms, lcp_distribution
GROUP BY day
TIMESERIES day
WITH TOTALS
SINCE startOfDay(-30d) UNTIL endOfDay(-1d)
ORDER BY day ASC
LIMIT 1000
VISUALIZE lcp_p75_ms TYPE line
```

#### Query 2 — INP p75 Daily Trend (30d)

```shopifyql
FROM web_performance
SHOW inp_p75_ms, inp_distribution
GROUP BY day
TIMESERIES day
WITH TOTALS
SINCE startOfDay(-30d) UNTIL endOfDay(-1d)
ORDER BY day ASC
LIMIT 1000
VISUALIZE inp_p75_ms TYPE line
```

#### Query 3 — CLS p75 Daily Trend (30d)

```shopifyql
FROM web_performance
SHOW p75_cls, cls_distribution
GROUP BY day
TIMESERIES day
WITH TOTALS
SINCE startOfDay(-30d) UNTIL endOfDay(-1d)
ORDER BY day ASC
LIMIT 1000
VISUALIZE p75_cls TYPE line
```

#### Query 4 — FCP p75 Daily Trend (30d)

```shopifyql
FROM web_performance
SHOW fcp_p75_ms, fcp_distribution
GROUP BY day
TIMESERIES day
WITH TOTALS
SINCE startOfDay(-30d) UNTIL endOfDay(-1d)
ORDER BY day ASC
LIMIT 1000
VISUALIZE fcp_p75_ms TYPE line
```

#### Query 5 — TTFB p75 Daily Trend (30d)

```shopifyql
FROM web_performance
SHOW ttfb_p75_ms, ttfb_distribution
GROUP BY day
TIMESERIES day
WITH TOTALS
SINCE startOfDay(-30d) UNTIL endOfDay(-1d)
ORDER BY day ASC
LIMIT 1000
VISUALIZE ttfb_p75_ms TYPE line
```

#### Query 6 — All CWVs by Page Type

```shopifyql
FROM web_performance
SHOW lcp_p75_ms, inp_p75_ms, p75_cls, fcp_p75_ms, ttfb_p75_ms
GROUP BY page_type
SINCE startOfDay(-30d) UNTIL endOfDay(-1d)
ORDER BY lcp_p75_ms DESC
LIMIT 50
```

#### Query 7 — All CWVs by Device Type

```shopifyql
FROM web_performance
SHOW lcp_p75_ms, inp_p75_ms, p75_cls, fcp_p75_ms, ttfb_p75_ms
GROUP BY device_type
SINCE startOfDay(-30d) UNTIL endOfDay(-1d)
LIMIT 10
```

#### Query 8 — Page × Device Cross-Tab (most diagnostic view)

```shopifyql
FROM web_performance
SHOW lcp_p75_ms, inp_p75_ms, p75_cls, fcp_p75_ms
GROUP BY page_type, device_type
SINCE startOfDay(-30d) UNTIL endOfDay(-1d)
ORDER BY lcp_p75_ms DESC
LIMIT 100
```

#### Query 9 — Distribution Buckets (%  of sessions by rating)

```shopifyql
FROM web_performance
SHOW lcp_distribution, inp_distribution, cls_distribution
GROUP BY page_type, device_type
SINCE startOfDay(-30d) UNTIL endOfDay(-1d)
LIMIT 100
```

#### Field Data Thresholds (CWV standard)

| Metric | 🟢 Good | 🟡 Needs Improvement | 🔴 Poor |
|--------|---------|---------------------|---------|
| LCP | ≤ 2,500ms | 2,500-4,000ms | > 4,000ms |
| INP | ≤ 200ms | 200-500ms | > 500ms |
| CLS | ≤ 0.1 | 0.1-0.25 | > 0.25 |
| FCP | ≤ 1,800ms | 1,800-3,000ms | > 3,000ms |
| TTFB | ≤ 800ms | 800-1,800ms | > 1,800ms |

#### How to Use the Results

1. **Reality-check lab findings.** If lab says "FCP 15s" but field says "FCP 1.2s", trust field.
   Lab was noise.
2. **Prioritize by impact.** Sessions × poor % = user impact. Pages with high traffic AND high
   poor % are top priority, even if p75 looks borderline.
3. **Distribution > p75.** A page with p75=2,800ms but 80% good + 5% poor is healthier than a
   page with p75=2,400ms and 15% poor. Always pull distribution buckets.
4. **Cross-tab reveals patterns.** Desktop-only CLS often indicates wide-viewport banners;
   mobile-only INP often indicates touch handler overhead.
5. **Use weekly trend to verify fixes.** Field data lags ~7-14 days due to CrUX aggregation
   window. Re-run queries weekly after deploying optimizations.

#### If the User Doesn't Have Admin Access

Fall back to PageSpeed Insights API for per-URL CrUX data:

```bash
curl -s "https://www.googleapis.com/pagespeedonline/v5/runPagespeed?url=<URL>&strategy=mobile&category=performance" \
  | jq '.loadingExperience.metrics'
```

Returns: `LARGEST_CONTENTFUL_PAINT_MS`, `INTERACTION_TO_NEXT_PAINT`,
`CUMULATIVE_LAYOUT_SHIFT_SCORE`, `FIRST_CONTENTFUL_PAINT_MS`, `EXPERIMENTAL_TIME_TO_FIRST_BYTE`.
Each has `percentile` (p75) and `category` (FAST/AVERAGE/SLOW).

Less granular than ShopifyQL (no page_type or device breakdown) but works without admin access.

## Phase 2: Codebase Analysis

Search the theme codebase for known performance anti-patterns. Use the Grep and Read tools
systematically. For Shopify-specific Liquid patterns, delegate to the `shopify-liquid` skill
if available.

### 2A. Layout File Audit (`layout/theme.liquid`)

This file is the most impactful because every page renders through it.

**Search for these patterns:**

| Pattern | Grep Command | Why It Matters |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| Inline `<script>` in `<head>` | `<script` before `</head>` | Blocks rendering — move to footer or defer |
| Synchronous external scripts | `<script src=` without `defer` or `async` | Blocks parsing |
| `document.createElement('script')` | Pattern in inline JS | Dynamic script injection, often blocking |
| Large inline JS blocks | Inline scripts > 20 lines | Should be external and deferred |
| CSS loaded without preload | `stylesheet_tag` without `preload: true` | Delays first paint |
| Missing preconnect hints | Check for `dns-prefetch` and `preconnect` | Slow third-party connections |
| `content_for_header` placement | Where Shopify injects app scripts | Apps inject here — can't control, but note the bloat |

**Grep commands to run:**

```
# Find all external script sources in layout
Grep: pattern="<script.*src=" path="layout/"

# Find inline scripts (not just src tags)
Grep: pattern="<script>" path="layout/" (multiline)

# Find render-blocking resources
Grep: pattern="stylesheet_tag" path="layout/"

# Find preconnect/prefetch hints
Grep: pattern="preconnect|dns-prefetch|preload" path="layout/"

# Find document.createElement patterns
Grep: pattern="document\.createElement" path="layout/"
```

### 2B. Snippet & Section Audit

```
# location.reload() — full page reload anti-pattern
Grep: pattern="location\.reload" path="snippets/" AND path="sections/" AND path="assets/"

# jQuery dependency — legacy, adds ~90KB
Grep: pattern="jQuery|\\$\\(" path="snippets/"

# Synchronous XHR
Grep: pattern="XMLHttpRequest|\.open\(" path="assets/"

# Inline event handlers
Grep: pattern="onclick=|onload=|onerror=" path="snippets/" AND path="sections/"

# Image loading strategies
Grep: pattern="loading=" path="snippets/"
```

### 2C. Asset Size Analysis

Check file sizes of key assets:

```bash
# List JS files by size
find assets/ -name "*.js" -exec wc -c {} + | sort -rn | head -20

# List CSS files by size
find assets/ -name "*.css" -exec wc -c {} + | sort -rn | head -20
```

### 2D. App Block Detection

Read `config/settings_data.json` and look for enabled app blocks. Cross-reference with the
third-party domains found in Phase 1 to map apps to their network impact.

```
# Find app blocks in settings
Grep: pattern="\"type\".*\"app\"" path="config/settings_data.json"

# Find app embed blocks
Grep: pattern="disabled.*false" path="config/settings_data.json"
```

### 2E. Image Optimization Audit

```
# Check for missing lazy loading in sections
Grep: pattern="<img" path="sections/" (then check which lack loading="lazy")

# Check for srcset usage (responsive images)
Grep: pattern="srcset" path="snippets/"

# Check for image dimension attributes (prevents CLS)
Grep: pattern="width.*height" path="snippets/image"
```

---

## Phase 3: Synthesis & Scoring

After collecting data, score the store against these benchmarks:

### Performance Scoring Matrix

| Metric | Good | Needs Work | Poor |
|--------|------|-----------|------|
| FCP | < 1.8s | 1.8-3.0s | > 3.0s |
| LCP | < 2.5s | 2.5-4.0s | > 4.0s |
| CLS | < 0.1 | 0.1-0.25 | > 0.25 |
| TBT | < 200ms | 200-600ms | > 600ms |
| DOM Elements | < 1,500 | 1,500-3,000 | > 3,000 |
| JS Heap | < 30MB | 30-60MB | > 60MB |
| Total Requests | < 80 | 80-150 | > 150 |
| Script Tags | < 30 | 30-60 | > 60 |
| Third-Party Domains | < 10 | 10-20 | > 20 |
| Total Transfer | < 1MB | 1-3MB | > 3MB |

### Duplicate Service Detection

Cross-reference all third-party domains against the Known Offenders Database (see
`references/known-services.md`). Flag:
- **Session recording overlap**: Hotjar + Clarity + FullStory + LogRocket (pick one)
- **Personalization overlap**: Dynamic Yield + Exponea/Bloomreach + Nosto + Klevu (pick one)
- **Pixel management overlap**: Elevar + TripleWhale + Littledata (pick one)
- **Analytics overlap**: GA4 via multiple injectors (GTM + direct + Elevar)
- **Review widget overlap**: Yotpo + Judge.me + Stamped + Loox (pick one)
- **Chat widget overlap**: Gorgias + Zendesk + Tidio + Intercom (pick one)

### Categorize All Issues

Every issue must be categorized as one of:

1. **Code Fix** — Our team can fix this directly in theme files
2. **App Configuration** — Requires changing app settings in Shopify admin
3. **Vendor Contact** — Need to reach out to the app/service vendor
4. **Business Decision** — Client needs to decide (e.g., remove an app)
5. **Architecture** — Structural change requiring planning

---

## Phase 4: Output Generation

### 🗂️ Output Doc Structure — Parent/Child Hierarchy

**Always split audit output into two parent sections with index subpages.** Flat docs with 10+
pages buries findings — hierarchy forces separation of raw data from recommendations and gives
readers a navigable TOC.

Root structure:
```
📊 Executive Summary             [root — cross-cutting 1-page summary]
📈 Metrics & Data                [parent with index table]
    🧪 Lab Metrics (Chrome/Playwright)
    📈 Real-User CWVs (30-Day)   [from ShopifyQL Queries 1-5]
    🎯 Page × Device Hit List    [from Query 8 + distribution]
    📊 Distribution Buckets      [from Query 9]
    🔌 Third-Party Services
    📦 Weight/Bandwidth Analysis (PDP or other heavy templates)
    📎 Appendix: ShopifyQL Queries
🛠️ Implementation & Fixes        [parent with index table]
    🚨 Critical Issues (Revised w/ Field Data)
    🗺️ Implementation Roadmap
    ❓ Decisions & Verification
```

#### Rules

1. **Executive Summary stays at root** — cross-cutting, users land here first
2. **Metrics & Data = raw findings only** — lab captures, field data, source queries,
   distribution tables. No recommendations.
3. **Implementation & Fixes = action items only** — issues, tickets, roadmap, client decisions,
   QA checklist. No raw data dumps (reference the Metrics pages instead).
4. **Each parent page is an index** — 1-sentence section purpose + table of children with
   1-2 line descriptions and "what question it answers". Example:

   | Page | What it covers | Answers |
   |------|---------------|---------|
   | 🎯 Page × Device Hit List | Cross-tab every page_type × device_type ranked by sessions × poor % | Where do the fires burn hottest? |

5. **Source queries live next to their data.** Paste the ShopifyQL query above the tables it
   produced. Reader can re-run independently.

#### ClickUp Implementation

When using `mcp__*__clickup_create_document_page`:
- Create parent pages first (root-level, no `parent_page_id`)
- Create child pages with `parent_page_id` set to parent's returned ID
- `clickup_update_document_page` **does NOT** support reparenting — get hierarchy right on
  creation or recreate under new parent

#### Notion / Google Docs

Same pattern applies. In Notion use a toggle or sub-page per child. In Google Docs use a
multi-page doc with clear H1 section dividers and a linked TOC at the top.

See `references/output-structure.md` for ready-to-paste index page templates.

### Output 1: Client-Facing Audit Document

Use this structure (see `references/audit-template.md` for the full template):

```markdown
# [Store Name] - Storefront Performance Audit
**Date:** [date] | **Audited by:** [team] | **Site:** [url]

## Executive Summary
[2-3 sentences: what's wrong, how bad, what the fix path looks like]

## Metrics at a Glance
[Table comparing all pages against benchmarks with color coding]

## Top External Services by Request Volume
[Table: rank, service, requests/page, purpose, verdict]

## Duplicate & Overlapping Tools
[Group by category, recommend which to keep]

## Issues We Can Fix (Code Changes)
[Table: priority, issue, impact, effort]

## Issues Requiring App/Vendor Action
[Table: priority, issue, vendor, suggested action]

## Recommended Roadmap
### Phase 1: Quick Wins (Week 1-2)
### Phase 2: Code Optimization (Week 3-4)
### Phase 3: Architecture (Month 2+)

## Decisions Needed from Client
[Numbered list of questions]

## Appendix: All External Services Detected
[Expandable full list]
```

### Output 2: Implementation Plan with Workable Tickets

This is the most important output — it turns audit findings into actionable work. Every issue
found during the audit MUST become a ticket in one of the tables below. Tickets should be
specific enough to copy directly into any project management tool (Linear, Jira, ClickUp,
Notion, GitHub Issues, etc.).

#### Ticket Structure

Every ticket must include ALL of these fields:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **ID** | Sequential ID per section (S1, S2... / M1, M2... / L1, L2...) |
| **Title** | Clear action-oriented title starting with a verb (Move, Replace, Remove, Add, Split, Implement) |
| **File(s)** | Exact file path(s) and line numbers where the change happens. Use `file.liquid:42` format |
| **What to Change** | Specific description of what to do — not vague ("optimize scripts") but concrete ("move Exponea inline script from `<head>` to before `</body>` and wrap in `setTimeout(fn, 3000)`") |
| **Effort** | Low (< 1h), Medium (1-4h), or High (4h+) — with hour estimate |
| **Impact** | Low, Medium, High, or Critical — with expected metric improvement |
| **Risk** | Low (safe, no functional change), Medium (needs QA), High (could break features) |
| **Category** | Code Fix, App Config, Vendor Contact, Business Decision, or Architecture |

#### Separate Code-Fixable vs Third-Party Issues

Split tickets into two clear groups so the team knows what they can act on immediately vs. what
requires external coordination:

**Group A: Issues We Can Fix (Code Changes)**
These are changes the dev team can implement directly in theme files. Include the exact code
change or pattern to apply.

**Group B: Issues from Third-Party Apps / Vendors**
These require reaching out to app vendors, changing app settings in Shopify admin, or making
business decisions about which apps to keep. Include the vendor name and suggested action.

#### Timeline Organization

Organize all tickets into three phases:

**SHORT TERM (Week 1-2) — Quick Wins, No Risk**

These should be safe, reversible changes anyone on the team can make:
- Moving scripts from `<head>` to footer with `defer`/`async`
- Adding `loading="lazy"` to images and iframes
- Removing duplicate tools (after client approval)
- Adding missing `preconnect` hints

Use this table format:

```markdown
### SHORT TERM — Quick Wins (Week 1-2)

#### A. Code Fixes

| ID | Title | File(s) | What to Change | Effort | Impact | Risk |
|----|-------|---------|----------------|--------|--------|------|
| S1 | Move analytics scripts to footer with defer | `layout/theme.liquid:110-165` | Move Exponea + Hotjar inline `<script>` blocks from `<head>` to before `</body>`. Wrap both in `setTimeout(function(){ ... }, 3000)` to delay execution until after critical rendering. | Low (2h) | **Critical** — unblocks FCP by 3-8s | Low |
| S2 | Add defer to chat widget script | `layout/theme.liquid:227` | Add `defer` attribute to Gorgias `<script>` tag: `<script defer id="gorgias-chat-widget...` | Low (30m) | **Medium** — reduces render blocking | Low |
| S3 | Set below-fold images to lazy load | `sections/featured-collection.liquid:45`, `sections/slideshow.liquid:240` | Change `loading: 'eager'` to `loading: 'lazy'` for all images below the first hero section | Low (2h) | **High** — prevents 100+ eager image loads | Low |

#### B. Third-Party / Vendor Actions

| ID | Issue | Vendor/App | What to Do | Effort | Impact |
|----|-------|-----------|------------|--------|--------|
| S4 | Duplicate session recording tools installed | Hotjar / Microsoft Clarity | Remove one — recommend keeping Clarity (free, lighter). Disable Hotjar in Shopify admin → Online Store → Themes → Customize → App embeds | Low (1h) | **High** — removes 3-10 requests + JS |
| S5 | Abnormal request volume from pixel manager | Elevar | Contact Elevar support — 91-118 requests per page is abnormal (typical: 10-25). Likely duplicate event firing or misconfigured data layer | Low (1h) | **Critical** — could eliminate 70+ requests |
```

**MEDIUM TERM (Week 3-4) — Code Changes with Testing**

These require actual code modifications and QA:
- Replacing `location.reload()` with AJAX cart operations
- Replacing jQuery with native `fetch()`
- Implementing interaction-based loading (load on scroll/hover)
- Splitting vendor JS bundles
- Conditional CSS loading per page type

```markdown
### MEDIUM TERM — Code Optimization (Week 3-4)

#### A. Code Fixes

| ID | Title | File(s) | What to Change | Effort | Impact | Risk |
|----|-------|---------|----------------|--------|--------|------|
| M1 | Replace location.reload() with AJAX cart rebuild | `snippets/footer-scripts.liquid:18,37,119` | Replace all 3 instances of `location.reload()` with: dispatch `cart:build` event and let the theme's existing cart drawer rebuild handle the update. Remove the `if (template-cart) { location.reload() }` guards entirely. Test: add to cart on cart page, verify cart updates without page reload. | Medium (4h) | **High** — eliminates full page reloads | Medium |
| M2 | Replace jQuery cart operations with native fetch | `snippets/footer-scripts.liquid:4,24,97,111` | Replace `jQuery.post(theme.routes.cartAdd, data)` with `fetch(theme.routes.cartAdd, { method: 'POST', headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'}, body: JSON.stringify(data) })`. Replace `jQuery.getJSON` with `fetch().then(r => r.json())`. Replace `jQuery('#selector')` with `document.querySelector('#selector')`. | Medium (3h) | **Medium** — removes jQuery dependency from cart flow | Medium |
| M3 | Implement scroll-triggered loading for heavy widgets | `layout/theme.liquid` | Create a `snippets/deferred-scripts.liquid` that uses IntersectionObserver to load Gorgias, UserWay, and Instafeed only when user scrolls past first viewport. Pattern: create invisible sentinel div at 50vh, observe it, load scripts on intersection. | Medium (4h) | **High** — delays 40+ requests until user engages | Low |

#### B. Third-Party / Vendor Actions

| ID | Issue | Vendor/App | What to Do | Effort | Impact |
|----|-------|-----------|------------|--------|--------|
| M4 | Clarify personalization platform overlap | Exponea + Dynamic Yield | Both platforms do personalization, A/B testing, and recommendations. Schedule call with client to determine: which owns personalization? Can one be removed? If both needed, ensure they're not running overlapping experiments. | Medium (2h research) | **High** — could remove 8-9 requests |
```

**LONG TERM (Month 2+) — Architecture Changes**

Deeper structural work:
- Facade pattern for third-party widgets
- Cart system consolidation
- Service worker implementation
- App pruning after usage review
- Vendor JS bundle splitting

```markdown
### LONG TERM — Architecture (Month 2+)

| ID | Title | What to Change | Effort | Impact | Risk |
|----|-------|----------------|--------|--------|------|
| L1 | Implement facade pattern for all third-party widgets | Create lightweight placeholder elements (static HTML/CSS) for chat, accessibility, reviews widgets. Load actual widget JS only on user interaction (click, hover, scroll-into-view). This transforms initial load from 500+ requests to <100. | High (8h) | **Very High** — biggest single improvement | Medium |
| L2 | Consolidate GWP + Tiered Gifts into single cart middleware | Merge the two separate cart manipulation systems in `footer-scripts.liquid` into one unified cart middleware that handles all gift logic in a single cart fetch cycle. Eliminates race conditions and duplicate cart API calls. | High (6h) | **Medium** — cleaner code, fewer cart race conditions | High |
| L3 | Cart drawer DOM optimization | Current cart drawer adds 2,000+ DOM nodes on open. Implement virtual rendering: only render visible cart items, lazy-render app blocks inside drawer. | High (6h) | **Medium** — reduces DOM explosion and memory usage | Medium |
```

#### Verification Checklist

Always end the implementation plan with a verification section:

```markdown
## Verification Plan

After implementing each phase, verify improvements:

1. **Before/After Metrics** — Run the same audit script on the same pages and compare:
   - Total network requests (target: 50% reduction after Phase 1)
   - FCP/LCP times (target: under 3s after Phase 1, under 2s after Phase 2)
   - JS Heap usage (target: under 50MB after Phase 2)
   - DOM element count (target: under 2,000 after Phase 3)

2. **Functional QA** — For each medium/high risk ticket:
   - [ ] Add to cart works on all page types
   - [ ] Cart drawer opens and updates correctly
   - [ ] Cart page quantity changes work without reload
   - [ ] Checkout flow completes successfully
   - [ ] Mobile menu and navigation work
   - [ ] Search functionality works
   - [ ] Reviews display on PDP

3. **Monitoring** — After deployment:
   - Check Shopify's Web Performance dashboard for trend changes
   - Run Google PageSpeed Insights on mobile for all 4 page types
   - Monitor real user metrics (CrUX data) over 2-4 weeks
```

## Shopify-Specific Best Practices

These are the patterns every Shopify theme should follow. When auditing, check each one.

### Script Loading Order (layout/theme.liquid)

The ideal loading order in a Shopify theme:

```html
<head>
  <!-- 1. Critical preconnects (only domains needed for above-fold content) -->
  <link rel="preconnect" href="https://cdn.shopify.com" crossorigin>
  <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.shopifycdn.com" crossorigin>

  <!-- 2. Critical CSS (preloaded) -->
  {{ 'theme.css' | asset_url | stylesheet_tag: preload: true }}

  <!-- 3. Font face declarations (with font-display: swap) -->
  {% render 'font-face' %}

  <!-- 4. Minimal critical inline JS (theme config only, < 10 lines) -->
  <script>window.theme = { routes: {{ routes | json }} };</script>

  <!-- 5. Shopify required (cannot control) -->
  {{ content_for_header }}

  <!-- 6. Theme JS (ALWAYS deferred) -->
  <script src="{{ 'vendor.js' | asset_url }}" defer></script>
  <script src="{{ 'theme.js' | asset_url }}" defer></script>
</head>
<body>
  <!-- ... page content ... -->

  <!-- 7. Non-critical third-party scripts (before </body>, deferred or async) -->
  <!-- Chat widgets, analytics, accessibility — load LAST -->
</body>
```

**Anti-patterns to flag:**
- Analytics scripts (Exponea, Hotjar, Clarity) in `<head>` instead of before `</body>`
- Any `<script src="...">` without `defer` or `async`
- Large inline `<script>` blocks (> 20 lines) in `<head>`
- `document.createElement('script')` patterns that bypass defer
- Third-party scripts loaded before `content_for_header`

### Image Optimization

```liquid
{% comment %} GOOD: Lazy loading with responsive images {% endcomment %}
{% render 'image-element',
  image: section.settings.image,
  loading: 'lazy',
  preload: false,
  sizes: '(min-width: 769px) 50vw, 100vw'
%}

{% comment %} GOOD: Eager load ONLY above-fold hero images {% endcomment %}
{% render 'image-element',
  image: section.settings.hero_image,
  loading: 'eager',
  preload: true,
  fetchpriority: 'high'
%}
```

**Rules:**
- Only the first visible image (hero/banner) should be `loading="eager"` with `fetchpriority="high"`
- All other images: `loading="lazy"`
- All images need `width` and `height` attributes (prevents CLS)
- Use Shopify's `image_url` filter with size parameters, never raw URLs
- Use `srcset` for responsive images

### Section Rendering Performance

```liquid
{% comment %} GOOD: Conditional rendering prevents unnecessary DOM {% endcomment %}
{%- if section.settings.show_section -%}
  {% render 'heavy-component' %}
{%- endif -%}

{% comment %} BAD: Hidden with CSS but still in DOM {% endcomment %}
<div style="display: none">
  {% render 'heavy-component' %}
</div>
```

### Cart Operations

```javascript
// GOOD: AJAX cart update without page reload
async function updateCart(data) {
  const response = await fetch('/cart/change.js', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify(data)
  });
  const cart = await response.json();
  document.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('cart:build', { detail: { cart } }));
}

// BAD: Full page reload after cart update
jQuery.post('/cart/add.js', data).done(function() {
  location.reload(); // Destroys performance — reloads ALL scripts
});
```

### App Block Impact Awareness

Every Shopify app installed adds scripts via `content_for_header`. You can't control this
injection point, but you can:
- Audit which apps are installed vs. actually used
- Identify apps that inject multiple scripts (some inject 3-5 separate files)
- Recommend removing unused apps (each removal = fewer injected scripts)
- Use Shopify's built-in "App embeds" toggle to disable per-app without uninstalling

## Third-Party Script Analysis

### Methodology

For each external domain detected:

1. **Identify the service** — match domain against Known Offenders Database
2. **Count requests** — how many network requests does this service make?
3. **Measure size** — total transfer size from this domain
4. **Assess necessity** — is this service essential for the store's business?
5. **Check for overlap** — does another installed service do the same thing?
6. **Rate impact** — low (<3 requests), medium (3-10), high (10-30), critical (30+)
