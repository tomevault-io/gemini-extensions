# Repository Guidelines

## Maintenance & Documentation

- Keep AGENTS.md and README.md in lockstep with any meaningful behavior or UX change; prune stale details to keep both compact.
- Keep BENCHMARK.md aligned with benchmark suites, metrics, and snapshot tables. README should carry only the simplified benchmark summary and one link out to the full benchmark doc.
- Keep ARCHITECTURE.md aligned with the actual code structure. README should keep only the simplified architecture diagram and link out to the fuller developer-oriented architecture doc.
- Keep the architecture diagram in README.md aligned with the actual code at all times. Direction is always code -> diagram: update the diagram after any factual architecture change, never the other way around.
- Prioritize clear UX and documentation for a global audience (not just native English readers); keep CLI/report text transparent.
- Write all user-facing text for a global audience. Prefer short, plain English over dense prose, idioms, or culture-specific phrasing.
- When any doc, README section, benchmark note, or user-facing explanation makes claims about external models, tools, metrics, benchmarks, or research, cite primary sources inline near the exact claim and do not make the wording stronger than the source supports.
- In summaries, prefer one clear link to the deeper document instead of repeating the same link multiple times in nearby text.
- Keep README.md easy to scan and easy to understand. If something can be explained simply, write it simply.
- Keep README.md limited to the text users actually need. Push deeper methodology, edge cases, long rationale, and benchmark detail into separate docs instead of bloating the README.
- Treat README.md like product-facing documentation: short, clear, practical. Treat detailed reference material the same way as code structure: move it into focused files when depth is required.
- When you need external library/tool details, fetch official docs via the Context7 tool instead of ad-hoc searches.

## Tool Purpose & Problem Domain

**duplicalis** is a CLI tool for detecting duplicate and near-duplicate React components in large codebases. It addresses a common problem in component libraries: Developer A creates ComponentA, then Developer B creates ComponentB that is 80–95% similar in behavior, structure, and styling but not textually identical.

### Primary Goals

- Identify duplicate or near-duplicate React components using semantic analysis (embeddings + AST).
- Surface components that are almost identical and could be unified via props/configuration.
- Detect copy-paste patterns where reuse of the original would be preferable.

### Duplication Patterns Detected

The tool labels similarity matches with specific duplication classes:

| Label                  | Description                                                                      |
| :--------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `prop-parameterizable` | Components differ mainly by prop values/sets; could be unified via props.        |
| `copy-paste-variant`   | Very high semantic + textual similarity; looks like copy with small edits.       |
| `logic-duplicate`      | Internal logic (hooks, handlers) is similar even if JSX/styles differ.           |
| `style-duplicate`      | Styles are nearly identical even if component code differs.                      |
| `forked-clone`         | High similarity but larger uneven differences; suggest canonical implementation. |
| `wrapper-duplicate`    | Many thin wrappers around the same base component.                               |

### Key Design Decisions

- **Imports treated as low-signal**: Import statements are normalized/summarized; they don't dominate similarity scores.
- **Component as primary unit**: One component = one chunk. Multi-component files are handled separately.
- **Semantic representation over raw text**: AST-based extraction preserves structure while ignoring irrelevant whitespace/comments.
- **Parser mode is extension-aware and decorator-aware**: Rust-backed SWC parsing keeps `.ts` files out of JSX mode to avoid angle-bracket TypeScript syntax being misread as JSX; `.tsx/.jsx/.js` keep JSX enabled, and parser decorators stay on so MobX-style fields and other decorated classes do not break scans.
- **Parser walk is single-pass**: Style imports and component metadata are collected in one SWC AST walk, and component source slices come from normalized node spans instead of repeated line splitting.
- **Parsed analysis is cached persistently**: Parsed component metadata plus semantic representations are stored in a file-aware cache and invalidated when source files or dependent stylesheets change.
- **Path-agnostic embeddings**: File-system paths are excluded from the embedded representation so similarity scores reflect code/style only, not folder layout.
- **Pluggable embedding backend**: Local model by default; remote API opt-in via env vars.
- **Remote trust boundary is explicit**: Remote mode sends component representations to the configured embeddings endpoint; local mode keeps analysis on-box.
- **O(n²) similarity acceptable**: For up to a few thousand components; basic mitigations (top-N neighbors, early pruning) applied.
- **Similarity inner loop is cached**: Pair scoring reuses precomputed vector norms and per-component metadata so repeated comparisons do less work.
- **Exact similarity can parallelize**: Larger scans can shard the exact O(n²) pair evaluation across worker threads while keeping merge order and final reports deterministic.
- **Style signals are scoped**: CSS is included only when we can map it to detected class names (including `styles.foo`/`styles['foo']`), keeping full matching rule blocks (selectors + declarations) plus CSS-in-JS snippets. Plain imports without class usage are ignored, style weights are zeroed when no style signal exists, and `style-duplicate` labels are skipped when similarity is explained solely by a shared stylesheet with no inline/unique styles.
- **Cache cleanup is file-aware**: Cache entries keep the originating file path; cleanup removes only entries whose source files are gone and tolerates malformed cache keys.
- **Style reads are memoized per run**: Stylesheets are read once per absolute path to keep scans fast when many components share the same CSS.
- **Embedding work is memoized per run**: Identical component representations reuse the same in-memory embedding request within a single scan, reducing duplicate backend work before cache persistence.
- **Bundled benchmark suite**: `benchmark` reuses the same component-analysis pipeline on a curated suite of positive pairs and hard negatives so embedding comparisons stay grounded in duplicate detection, not generic retrieval.
- **Benchmark metrics separate raw ranking from reported output**: AP/MRR/Recall@K and separation gap (`min positive - max hard negative`) score the raw embedding space, while best-F1 threshold and hard-negative false positives are measured through the real similarity pipeline after suppression rules.
- **Benchmark score balances threshold and ranking metrics**: The composite score weights F1 at 45%, AP at 30%, and hard-negative precision at 25% to avoid cliff effects on small test sets where a single pair crossing a threshold can swing F1 disproportionately.
- **Wrapper specializations stay out of benchmark positives**: The current report pipeline intentionally suppresses thin wrapper specializations before labeling, so benchmark positives focus on pairs the CLI is actually expected to surface.
- **Benchmark cache is isolated**: Benchmark runs store cache files under `.cache/duplicalis/benchmarks/<suite>/` by default so scan caches stay clean.
- **File discovery is deterministic**: Scans normalize, deduplicate, and sort discovered files so reports and cache behavior stay stable across runs.
- **Stats favor signal over noise**: Console table highlights match coverage, reported/suppressed pairs (with top reasons), timings, and cache activity; low-value noise metrics stay out.
- **Console banners**: Runs print a centered pixel banner plus a wordmark banner before the report; they are console-only and never written to output files.
- **Compare mode**: `--compare <globs...>` marks “target” files; only target-vs-non-target pairs are reported (no target-vs-target or baseline-vs-baseline).
- **Writes are atomic**: Cache/config/report files and downloaded model artifacts are written via temp-file swap, reducing partial-file corruption on interrupted runs.

## Project Structure & Module Organization

- `bin/duplicalis.js` wires the executable and hands off to `src/cli.js`; `src/index.js` orchestrates scans, embeddings, similarity, and reporting.
- Core modules live in `src/` (e.g., `scanner.js` for file discovery, `parser.js` for component extraction, `embedding/` for local/remote backends, `similarity.js` for scoring, `output.js` for report emission, `benchmark*.js` for suite loading/metrics/reporting). Keep new utilities in this folder and favor single-purpose files.
- Keep code files under 500 lines of cohesive code. Split by responsibility before files become long, mixed, or hard to scan.
- Tests sit in `test/*.test.js` and mirror module names. Use `examples/` as fixtures for scan behavior and `benchmarks/react-component-duplicates-v1/` for benchmark corpus coverage. `coverage/` is generated output; `models/` stores the default ONNX embedding model.
- Keep test files and test groupings under 500 lines of cohesive code as well; split oversized suites by behavior or module seam.
- Runtime artifacts land in `.cache/duplicalis/embeddings.json`, `.cache/duplicalis/analysis.msgpack`, and `.cache/duplicalis/benchmarks/<suite>/`; keep them untracked. Configuration is read from `duplicalis.config.json` when present.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

- `npm install` to bootstrap.
- `npm start` shows CLI help; typical local run: `node ./bin/duplicalis.js scan examples --threshold 0.9`.
- `npm run benchmark -- --api-url https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/embeddings --no-progress` runs the bundled benchmark against the default local + remote shortlist. Use `--models <list...>` or `--manifest <path>` to narrow or replace the suite.
- `npm run lint` (ESLint rules + complexity guard), `npm run format` / `npm run format:check` (Prettier over `src/**/*.js`).
- `npm test` or `npm run coverage` runs Vitest with V8 coverage thresholds enforced.
- Tests must stay self-contained in CI; do not rely on a pre-downloaded `models/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` tree when a temporary fixture or mock is enough.
- Use `--save-config [path]` to persist the current run options into `duplicalis.config.json` (or another path) so future runs inherit them.
- npm publishing is automated by `.github/workflows/publish-npm.yml` on tag pushes through Trusted Publisher with GitHub Actions OIDC. Do not add `NPM_TOKEN` to the workflow. The npm trusted publisher must target `pfrankov/duplicalis`, workflow filename `publish-npm.yml`, with `npm publish` allowed. Repository history uses `v`-prefixed tags (`v1.0.1`, `v1.1.0`), so `vX.Y.Z` is the canonical release format even though the workflow still accepts both styles.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

- ES modules only (`type: module`); keep imports relative and explicit. Prefer kebab-case filenames in `src/` and lowerCamelCase symbols.
- Prettier settings: 2-space indent, single quotes, trailing commas (es5), `printWidth: 100`. `.prettierignore` skips heavy assets (`models/`, `coverage/`, JSON).
- ESLint: `eslint:recommended` plus `complexity` <= 10, `max-lines` <= 500 for code/test files (ignoring blank lines and comments), and unused-arg ignore pattern `^_`. Console use is allowed.
- Husky + lint-staged auto-format `src/**/*.js` on commit; run format manually if touching other paths.
- Add brief JSDoc on exported functions when behavior is non-obvious.

## Testing Guidelines

- Framework: Vitest (`test/*.test.js`). Coverage gates are 100% for lines/branches/functions/statements; add or adjust tests before merging.
- Keep test names descriptive (`<module>.test.js` with `describe`/`it` mirroring public API). Use `examples/` components as fixtures instead of synthetic strings when possible.
- Prefer unit-level assertions; mock network/model downloads where needed. Include regression cases when fixing bugs.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

- Use short, imperative commit messages (e.g., `fix: tighten embedding cache handling`). Squash optional; keep history readable.
- PRs should summarize intent, list key changes, and call out config/env impacts (`MODEL`, `API_KEY`, paths). Attach relevant CLI or test output when behavior changes.
- Ensure lint, format:check, and test commands pass before requesting review; avoid committing generated artifacts (`coverage/`, `.cache/`, downloaded `models/`).

## Configuration & Model Handling

- `dotenv` loads `.env`; notable vars: `MODEL` (`local|remote|mock`), `MODEL_PATH`, `MODEL_REPO`, `API_KEY`, `API_URL`, `API_MODEL`, `API_TIMEOUT`. Prefer `duplicalis.config.json` for repo-shared defaults, env vars for secrets.
- Output language is set via `--lang` or `language` in `duplicalis.config.json` (`en`, `ru`, `es`, `fr`, `de`, `zh`).
- Models are auto-downloaded when missing (`AUTO_DOWNLOAD_MODEL` true by default) and the download is memoized per process. When disabling auto-download, make sure a usable ONNX file lives under `<model>/onnx/`.
- `--save-config` merges resolved run settings into the target config file (defaults to `<root>/duplicalis.config.json`) but intentionally does not persist the resolved `root` or default derived `cachePath`, keeping saved configs portable across machines and worktrees.
- `benchmark` defaults to the bundled `react-component-duplicates-v1` suite and the curated shortlist `local`, `text-embedding-3-small`, `text-embedding-3-large`, `gemini-embedding-001`, `qwen3-embedding-8b`, `bge-m3`, `multilingual-e5-large`, and `all-mpnet-base-v2`.

### Embedding Backend Selection

| Mode              | Description                                                                                                         | When to use                                      |
| :---------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `local` (default) | Uses local ONNX model (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`). No network calls.                                                       | Offline/privacy-sensitive environments.          |
| `remote`          | OpenAI-compatible API. Defaults to OpenAI `/v1/embeddings`; local Ollama-style endpoints can run without `API_KEY`. | Better accuracy or when local model is too slow. |
| `mock`            | Returns deterministic vectors.                                                                                      | Testing only.                                    |

### Remote API Configuration

```bash
export MODEL=remote
export API_KEY=sk-...                    # Required for OpenAI
export API_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1/embeddings  # Optional, defaults to OpenAI embeddings endpoint
export API_MODEL=text-embedding-3-small  # Optional
export API_TIMEOUT=30000                 # Optional, milliseconds
```

## Autonomous Review & Refactor Workflow

- Prefer first-party installed review workflows (`security-best-practices`, `security-threat-model`, `security-ownership-map`) when changes touch remote I/O, model fetching, or other trust boundaries.
- Preserve CLI flags, config schema, output shape, and duplication labels unless the user explicitly asks for an API change.
- Fix declared guardrails first: failing lint, excessive complexity, misleading docs, or behavior that contradicts README.md/AGENTS.md.
- Treat `MODEL=remote`, `API_URL`, `API_KEY`, `MODEL_REPO`, and model auto-download as trust boundaries; document any code-egress or supply-chain impact before changing them.
- Prefer OpenAI-compatible `/v1/embeddings` endpoints for remote providers; local Ollama endpoints may be unauthenticated.

---

## Ignore Mechanisms

### CLI-Level Ignores

- `--exclude <globs>`: Skip paths matching patterns (e.g., `**/*.test.tsx`).
- Specific duplication classes can be disabled in `duplicalis.config.json`.

### File-Level Ignores (Comment Syntax)

- `// duplicalis-ignore-file` — Place at top of file to skip entire file.
- `// duplicalis-ignore-next` — Place before a component definition to skip that component.

---

## Component Representation Strategy

Each component is converted to a semantic text representation before embedding:

```
// COMPONENT: Button
// PROPS: variant: primary|secondary; disabled?: boolean
// HOOKS: useState, useEffect(dataFetch)
// LOGIC: handles submit, validates form, shows error
// JSX TREE: Button -> Icon + Label
// STYLES: classNames [button, button-primary]; key rules [background, color, padding]
```

Key principles:

- **Strip comments and irrelevant whitespace**; normalize formatting.
- **Summarize imports**: Only structural info (which external components are used), not raw import lines.
- **Associate styles** via imports of `.css/.scss/.module.css` or CSS-in-JS in the same file.
- **If representation is too large**: Summarize/compress structure instead of blind truncation.

---

## Code Quality Principles

- Remove unnecessary abstractions, checks, branching, and code paths when they do not protect a real requirement.
- Functions should usually be extracted only when logic is used more than once or when a dense concept becomes materially easier to read as a named unit.
- Avoid over-abstraction and "layers for the sake of layers"; prefer direct, readable code paths.
- Variable and function names should be short, clear, logical, and appropriate to their scope.
- Cyclomatic complexity ≤ 10 per function (enforced via ESLint `complexity` rule).
- 100% test coverage (lines, branches, functions, statements) enforced via Vitest + V8.
