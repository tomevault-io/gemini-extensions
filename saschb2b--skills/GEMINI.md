# Skills Repo Conventions

This repo is a collection of agent skills. Each skill is one self-contained folder under `skills/<bucket>/<slug>/` with a `SKILL.md` inside. Skills work with any coding agent that supports the [skills.sh](https://skills.sh) installer (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Cline, Windsurf, OpenCode).

## Layout

```
skills/
  engineering/
    <slug>/SKILL.md
  productivity/
    <slug>/SKILL.md
```

Buckets in use:

- `engineering/` for code-adjacent practice (audits, scaffolds, refactors)
- `productivity/` for process and discipline (planning, writing, design)

The two folders are the on-disk split (operates on a codebase vs operates on a process). They do not affect discovery: the agent auto-invokes a skill by reading its `description`, and skills install by slug. So the folder is just a maintenance home. The root `README.md` browse view groups skills by **domain** instead (Frontend/UI/UX, Game, AI & agents, Writing & workflow, Mobile, Security), which is how a human actually looks for one, and each `SKILL.md` carries a `tags:` facet (see the format below) for finer slicing. At ~16 skills this shallow tree is deliberate. Do not add domain folders until a cluster reaches roughly five skills sharing a tag; grow a folder from an earned tag cluster, not a guess.

## Adding a skill

When you add a new skill, touch five places. Forgetting any of them silently degrades the install experience or leaves the skill untested for invocation.

1. `skills/<bucket>/<slug>/SKILL.md` plus `skills/<bucket>/<slug>/permissions.yaml`. The skill itself. Every skill folder carries a `permissions.yaml` capability manifest (the card's `bom` counts it, so a missing one desyncs the card). For a pure-knowledge skill it is the five-line block used by `no-slop` and `autopilot`. `model: knowledge`, `executes: false`, `network: none`, `shell: false`, `filesystem_writes: false`. Those stay `false` even when the skill's guidance has the agent write files, because that is the agent's capability, not the shipped artifact's.
2. `README.md`. Add a line under the matching **domain group** in the Skill reference section (the listing groups by domain, not by bucket). Link the slug to its SKILL.md.
3. `skills/<bucket>/README.md`. Add a line in the bucket index.
4. `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`. Add `./skills/<bucket>/<slug>` to the `skills` array.
5. `evals/cases/<slug>.yaml`. Invocation eval cases: a few `should_fire` prompts, a couple `should_not_fire`, and `route_to_sibling` cases for any skill it overlaps with. See [evals/README.md](evals/README.md).

Then run `pnpm check` (which runs `node scripts/check-skills.mjs`) and `pnpm eval:validate`. The first enforces every skill rule below (the `: ` and ` #` frontmatter traps, `name` matching the folder, the 1024-char description cap, plugin.json registration, that every relative link inside the skill resolves, and that any `references/` directory is a conformant OKF bundle). The second checks the invocation cases are valid YAML, match the schema, and cover every skill. Both exit non-zero on any failure. Run them before you commit.

The `javascript-ecosystem` skill is a dated snapshot of a fast-moving ecosystem, so it carries extra anti-staleness machinery: a snapshot `date`, a per-notes-file `**Verified YYYY-MM-DD**` stamp, a freshness section in its `SKILL.md`, and `skills/engineering/javascript-ecosystem/MAINTENANCE.md`. Run `node scripts/check-freshness.mjs` to list the oldest entries due for a re-verify against official docs.

## Trust cards (re-signing a changed skill)

Most skills carry a `CARD.md` (a `trust-card` OKF concept binding the skill's content digest, signature, and capability manifest) plus a rendered `CARD.svg`. `cards.json` at the repo root is the aggregate render feed. `pnpm cards:check` gates CI: it rebuilds every card and fails if any is stale, so a skill whose files changed must have its card regenerated, rebuilt, and re-signed before merge.

The lifecycle when you edit a skill's content, in order (finish all content edits first, since the digest is computed over the bundle):

1. **Regenerate the card** so its `target_digest` matches the new content:
   ```sh
   python3 skills/engineering/trust-card/scripts/card.py generate skills/<bucket>/<slug> \
       --identity did:web:saschb2b.com --expires <YYYY-MM-DD>
   ```
   This rewrites `<slug>/CARD.md` and `<slug>/CARD.manifest.json`. Convention for `--expires` is roughly one year out (the existing cards were minted with a 2027-06-29 horizon).
2. **Rebuild the render feed** for that skill: `pnpm cards <slug>` (updates `cards.json` and `<slug>/CARD.svg`). Run bare `pnpm cards` to rebuild all.
3. **Sign the bound digest.** This is Sascha's interactive step and cannot be done from an agent session:
   ```sh
   python3 skills/engineering/trust-card/scripts/card.py sign skills/<bucket>/<slug>/CARD.md
   ```
   With `cosign` on PATH this runs the keyless Sigstore + Rekor flow, which opens a browser for OIDC login and writes `<slug>/CARD.md.sigstore` with the Rekor entry stapled. Add `--key ~/keys/card.key` to use the local ed25519 fallback instead. Card artifacts (`CARD.md`, `CARD.svg`, `CARD.md.sigstore`, hero art) are excluded from the content digest, so signing never re-stales the thing it signs.
4. **Verify and commit the signature separately.** Sascha commits it as `chore: sign <slug> changes` (a distinct commit before merge, per the git workflow):
   ```sh
   python3 skills/engineering/trust-card/scripts/card.py verify skills/<bucket>/<slug>/CARD.md \
       --bundle skills/<bucket>/<slug>
   pnpm cards:check   # what CI enforces; stays red until the signed card is committed
   ```

The full command reference and the layer-by-layer trust model live in `skills/engineering/trust-card/SKILL.md` and its `references/layers.md`.

## Skill-invocation evals

The `description` is the only field the agent reads when deciding to auto-invoke a skill, so a reword can silently stop the agent reaching for it, or make it grab a sibling instead. The harness in `evals/` is the regression test. Run it on your own whenever you touch a skill:

- After adding a skill or editing any `description`, run `pnpm eval:validate`. It is fast, needs no model and no key, and fails on a broken case file or a skill with no cases.
- When a `description` changed, also run the full invocation eval to confirm the model still routes correctly. It needs no API key, because the classification is an agent text run. `pnpm eval` validates and writes `evals/results/manifest.json`; classify the prompts with a subagent (blind, against a stripped `{id, prompt}` view so the answers do not leak) writing `evals/results/answers.json`; then `pnpm eval:score` prints recall, specificity, disambiguation, and a findings list. Steps are in [evals/README.md](evals/README.md).

A 100% table means the descriptions separate cleanly under a focused router, not that auto-invocation is guaranteed mid-conversation. Treat the disambiguation column (does the intended sibling win on an overlapping prompt) as the signal that two descriptions have clean boundaries.

## SKILL.md format

```markdown
---
name: <slug>
description: <one or two sentences. Lead with what the skill does, then explicit "Use when ..." triggers. This is the only field the agent reads when deciding to load the skill.>
tags: [<domain>, <task-type>]
date: 2026-05-12
source_post: <blog-slug>
---

# <Display Title>

## <Section>

...
```

Rules:

- Keep the body under ~100 lines. If it grows past that, move the detail into a `references/` subdirectory and link to it from SKILL.md. The agent reads SKILL.md eagerly and the reference files only when it needs them. This is "progressive disclosure". That `references/` directory is a vendored OKF bundle (see "Vendored knowledge as OKF bundles" below), so it ships in the same install and adds no dependency.
- The `description` field is critical and capped at 1024 characters. It must include trigger phrases the agent will recognize in user prompts.
- **Never put `: ` (colon followed by a space) inside any frontmatter value.** YAML parses it as a key/value separator inside a plain scalar, gray-matter throws, and the skill is silently dropped from the build. Use a period, semicolon, dash, or rephrase. Colons in URLs, code (`docker:latest`), or compound words without trailing space are fine.
- **Never put ` #` (a space followed by `#`) inside any frontmatter value.** YAML treats `#` as a comment marker when preceded by whitespace; the rest of the line is silently dropped from the parsed value. If you must mention hex codes in a description, do it in the body of SKILL.md instead.
- `name` in frontmatter must match the folder name.
- The H1 in the body is the human-facing title. The `name` in frontmatter is the slug used everywhere else.
- Dates are ISO 8601 (`YYYY-MM-DD`).
- `source_post` is a blog slug under `saschb2b.com/blog/<slug>` when the skill was distilled from a post. Optional.
- `tags` is an optional inline list of lowercase-hyphen facets, domain first then task-type (`tags: [frontend, react, review]`). It is advisory metadata for browsing and for deciding when a cluster has earned its own folder, not something the agent reads to route. Use the inline flow form `[a, b, c]` (a block list of `- item` lines also parses, since the frontmatter checker skips indented lines); the `: ` and ` #` traps still apply, so keep tag values plain.

## Vendored knowledge as OKF bundles

When a skill carries substantial reference knowledge (detection catalogs, per-area notes, before/after guidance), that knowledge lives in `<skill>/references/` as a conformant [Open Knowledge Format](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/knowledge-catalog) bundle. SKILL.md stays the thin procedure and links into it.

Why a bundle, not loose files. A bundle is just markdown with frontmatter, so it ships inside the skill with no extra install and no dependency. Formatting the knowledge as OKF makes it navigable (progressive disclosure via `index.md`), portable (any agent or viewer reads it, no SDK), and citable, and it lets the knowledge be promoted to a standalone bundle later without a rewrite. Use it when the reference material is big enough to bloat SKILL.md or is reused; a small skill keeps its knowledge inline.

**Always work on a bundle through the `okf` skill, never freehand.** This is a standing instruction for any agent in this repo, covering every `references/` bundle and any standalone bundle authored here:

- **Creation.** New bundle or new concept file: invoke the `okf` skill and follow its `init`/`add` playbooks (descriptive `type`, recommended frontmatter, structural body, the sharpest markdown form per fact).
- **Enrichment.** Growing a bundle from a source or deepening one: run the skill's `enrich` flow including the entity pass, so every load-bearing name the documents mention but never explain gets its own linked concept.
- **Editing.** Any edit to an existing bundle triggers the skill's implicit-mode bookkeeping: refresh the concept's `timestamp`, append a dated `log.md` entry (heading is the bare ISO date), regenerate the affected `index.md`, and add a link with the relationship named in prose whenever an edit creates one.
- **Validation.** Finish every bundle-touching change with the skill's `validate` command in strict mode (the producer gate: zero orphans, zero broken links), not just the default conformance check that CI runs. `pnpm check` passing is necessary, not sufficient.

Rules for a `references/` bundle:

- Every concept file carries YAML frontmatter with a non-empty `type` (the one hard OKF requirement). Recommended: `title`, a one-sentence `description`, `tags`, and an ISO 8601 `timestamp`. The `: ` and ` #` frontmatter traps apply here too, so quote any value that needs them.
- A root `references/index.md` declares `okf_version: "0.1"` and lists each concept with its description. It is the only `index.md` in the bundle allowed frontmatter.
- Reserved filenames `index.md` and `log.md` are never concept files.
- Cross-link with relative or bundle-absolute (`/foo.md`) paths, and name the relationship in the prose, not the link.

Validate one bundle directly with the vendored checker; after producing or editing a bundle, run it with `--strict` (the producer gate, turning orphans and broken concept links into failures):

```sh
node skills/engineering/okf/okf-validate.mjs skills/<bucket>/<slug>/references --strict
```

`check-skills.mjs` runs the non-strict form for every skill that has a `references/` directory and fails on a non-conformant bundle, so the hard rule is enforced on every commit; the strict pass is the agent's own bar when touching a bundle.

`javascript-ecosystem` follows this layout too: its ~90 per-tool notes live under `references/<category>/`. On top of the OKF bundle it carries the dated-snapshot machinery (a per-note `**Verified YYYY-MM-DD**` stamp, `scripts/check-freshness.mjs`, and `MAINTENANCE.md`), because a fast-moving ecosystem snapshot needs explicit re-verification.

## Style

- Tables for decision matrices. Lists for sequential steps. Headings for sections the agent will need to jump to.
- Lead each section with what the agent should do, not background motivation. Background goes after the action.
- Never em or en dashes. Write natural prose with periods, commas, colons, parentheses.
