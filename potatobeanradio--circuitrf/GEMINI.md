# circuitRF

Lightweight cross-platform RF circuit simulator (DC, S-parameters, harmonic balance,
loadpull/sourcepull). **NOT a SPICE simulator.** See `docs/PRD.md` for scope, the five
hero circuits, and non-goals. This file is standing project memory — keep it current.

## Searching this repo

**Use `grep` (or ripgrep) directly whenever possible instead of spawning a search agent.** This
repo's structure is well-known and its files are plain text — a targeted `grep -n` finds a
symbol, class, or XAML control faster and far cheaper than delegating a "find X" task to an
agent. Reach for an agent only when the search genuinely needs multi-step reasoning across many
unrelated locations, not for straightforward lookups.

## Resolving Issues
If significant findings were found during bug fixes or changes, write to the relevant RESOLVED.md 
files never CLAUDE.md. This helps keep the CLAUDE.md files small.

## Stack
- .NET 10 (LTS), C# 14
- Avalonia 12 (UI), SkiaSharp (canvas rendering), CommunityToolkit.MVVM (MVVM)
- CSparse.NET (sparse complex LU for large MNA), NumFlat (dense linear algebra)
- `RfCore` (Touchstone I/O, network params, the `DataSet`/`DataCube` result types, interpolation,
  renormalization, plotting) is **a first-class project of this repository, exactly like `Core`,
  `Engine`, and `Ui`** — `src/RfCore/` with its tests at `tests/RfCore.Tests/`, both listed in
  `circuitrf.slnx`, referenced via ordinary `ProjectReference`.

  **It is NOT a subtree, and there is nothing left to "un-subtree" (2026-07-30).** It arrived via
  `git subtree add` on 2026-07-29 purely to preserve history
  (brief-housekeeping-tearoff-palette-repo.md §6 — splotRF, the other consumer of the standalone
  RfCore repo, was being retired). **"Being a subtree" is not a persistent state in git**: there is
  no `.gitmodules`, no config, no live link to anything. RfCore's 24 original commits are a
  permanent *second parent* of merge `0bd04db`, and `git blame` on any file under `src/RfCore/`
  still resolves to its original author and date. The only residue is a three-line
  `git-subtree-dir/-mainline/-split` trailer in that one old commit message, which is inert unless
  someone runs `git subtree pull` — **so don't.** Treat `src/RfCore/` as ordinary first-party code.

  *Known git wrinkle, not a history loss:* `git log --follow <path>` does not cross the merge (a
  documented `--follow`-vs-merges limitation). `git blame` does. To read the pre-merge history
  directly: `git log 0bd04db^2 -- src/Data/DataCube.cs` (the *old* path, on the pre-merge parent).

  **The architectural boundary is unchanged and does not depend on directory placement** — it is
  enforced by assembly-reference checks in `tests/Firewall.Tests`, which is why moving RfCore under
  `src/` cost nothing. RfCore still references no UI framework, and nothing in it may.

## Build / test / run
- Build:   `dotnet build`
- Test:    `dotnet test`
- Run CLI: `dotnet run --project src/Cli -- <args>`
  Verbs: `sparam`, `dc`, **`hb`**, `elab`. `hb` runs the netlist's harmonic-balance analysis —
  single- or multi-tone — and runs the whole sweep when a `parametric_sweep` wraps it (naming the
  inner HB is promoted to its wrapper, since running the inner alone silently drops the sweep axis).
  It evaluates the TestBench's `measure` lines exactly as the GUI does, so a `.cnl` that works
  headless works when opened. `--set var=expr` overrides a global before elaboration;
  `-o out.{mat,npy,txt}` exports.
- Package: one script per platform, all writing to `dist/` — `packaging/windows/build-msi.ps1`
  (.msi, x64/arm64/x86), `packaging/macos/build-dmg.sh` (.dmg, Apple Silicon; wraps the existing
  `src/Ui/bundleFor*MacOS.sh`), `packaging/linux/build-deb.sh` (.deb, x64/arm64, needs `fpm`).
  **Each must run ON its own platform** (WiX is Windows-only, `codesign`/`hdiutil` macOS-only, and
  the Windows PE icon is only embedded when the publish happens on Windows). Step-by-step
  instructions live in `BUILDING.md`, which `README.md` links to; keep the two in step.
  App icons (`.icns`/`.ico`/`.png`) are **build products** rasterised from the committed brand SVGs
  by `dotnet run --project tools/IconGen`, which every packaging script runs first — no icon binary
  is ever committed.

  **Two packaging rules exist because breaking either fails silently** (both held by
  `tests/Ui.Tests/PackagingScriptTests.cs`, both learned from a real Windows build, 2026-08-18):
  - **Every `.ps1` under `packaging/` must be pure ASCII.** Windows PowerShell 5.1 reads a BOM-less
    `.ps1` as cp1252, so a UTF-8 emoji or box-drawing char decodes to bytes 0x93/0x94 — the curly
    quotes `“ ”`, which PowerShell honours as string delimiters. Nothing errors: the parser swallows
    everything to the next quote-class byte, PRINTS it instead of running it, and continues. One `📦`
    turned the whole `dotnet publish` block into a string literal (verified against the AST, lines
    48-54), and the first visible symptom was a `Get-ChildItem` "cannot find path …\publish\win-x64"
    from a *later* step. A BOM also fixes it and is the wrong fix — invisible, and it does not
    survive an editor round-trip anyone would notice.
  - **What ships is named after the APPLICATION, not the assembly**: `circuitRF(.exe)`,
    `harmonicaRF(.exe)`, `wBond(.exe)`. The assembly stays `CircuitRF.Ui` (RfCore's
    `InternalsVisibleTo` — WB40), and .NET names the published host after the assembly with no
    property to separate them, so `src/Ui/CircuitRF.Ui.csproj`'s `CrfRenameApphost` target renames it
    **after publish only** — a plain `dotnet build`/`dotnet run` is untouched. Five packaging files
    repeat that name as a literal and must be changed together (the `.wxs` + `build-msi.ps1`, the
    Debian `postinst` + `.desktop`, the three `bundleFor*MacOS.sh` + their `Info.plist`s).
- **The version number is written in exactly one place: the repo-root `VERSION` file** (one line,
  e.g. `0.9.0-beta.1`). `Directory.Build.props` reads it into every assembly's
  `Version`/`InformationalVersion` — which is what the About box renders via `src/Ui/AppVersion.cs`
  — and `packaging/version.{sh,ps1}` derive from it the installer file names, the MSI
  ProductVersion, the stamped `CFBundleShortVersionString`/`CFBundleVersion`, and dpkg's `~`
  spelling. Nothing is generated or rewritten; the version strings in `Assets/macOS/*.plist` are
  placeholders the bundle scripts overwrite. **Never hard-code a version anywhere else** — three
  copies had already drifted (About said 0.9.0, the plists 0.1.0, the assembly the 1.0.0 default),
  which is what `tests/Ui.Tests/VersionSingleSourceTests.cs` now holds shut.

### `dotnet test` is fast by default (brief-test-default-fast.md, 2026-07-28)

**Plain `dotnet test`, with no flags, is the routine gate — it is fast by construction, not by
convention.** Repo-root `circuitrf.runsettings` (`TestCaseFilter: Category!=Benchmark`) is wired in via
`Directory.Build.props`'s `RunSettingsFilePath`, so every invocation — `dotnet test` at the root,
`dotnet test tests/Ui.Tests`, an IDE test run, CI — inherits the exclusion automatically. There is
nothing to type and nothing to forget. This supersedes the prior two-tag, filter-must-be-typed schemes
from brief-benchmark-gate-split.md and brief-test-suite-fast-loop.md: `Category=Nightly` is retired
and `Category=Slow` is gone as a category (its former members are either untagged, having been
measured under the threshold, or folded into `Benchmark`).

- **Repo root, no flags: 7,482 tests in ~4 min** (measured 2026-08-06). This is what "build+test
  green" means in every brief from here on, unless that brief's own text says otherwise.
  **`Engine.Tests` is ~3 min 24 s of that on its own** — measured alone, with `--no-build`, so it is
  the suite's own cost and not parallel contention. It grew there gradually across the L8/L9
  electromagnetic phases (65 s at L9b, ~2 min at the ground-via work) and no single test crosses the
  ~5 s `Category=Benchmark` threshold; ~1,000 tests averaging ~0.2 s each simply add up. **The
  earlier "5,169 tests in ~30 s" figure recorded here was stale by roughly an order of magnitude** —
  do not quote it. The other projects are still genuinely fast on their own: `Ui.Tests` ~27 s
  (5,075 tests), `Core.Tests` ~1 s, `RfCore.Tests` ~6 s, `Firewall.Tests` instant, so **scope the
  gate to the projects your change can reach** and keep the full-solution run for phase boundaries.
- **`RfCore.Tests` IS in `circuitrf.slnx` and IS covered by a plain `dotnet test`** (2026-07-30; it was
  not, until then — an older note in `src/Ui/CLAUDE.md` says otherwise and is marked superseded). 281
  routine tests, ~4 s. Its proprietary loadpull fixtures are git-ignored, so on a fresh clone 56 of them
  report **Skipped with a reason** via `FixtureFact`/`FixtureTheory` rather than failing — do not
  "repair" those skips by committing lab data.
- **`Category=Benchmark`** is the *only* opt-in tag. Applied mechanically wherever a test's measured
  wall-clock exceeds ~5 s — and, since 2026-07-30, also to a test that is *fast but wall-clock-sensitive*
  and therefore cannot survive the parallel-start burst of a full-solution run (`RfCore.Tests`'
  `Rbf2DPerfTests`, 4 methods: millisecond-fast, but a ~0.3 ms operation reads ~10 ms per sample under
  full-suite load, so even a best-of-20 gate flaked). **Do not untag those on the grounds that they run
  quickly** — they are tagged for the purpose the mechanism serves, not the letter of the ~5 s rule.
  Currently **122 test methods** repo-wide, counted rather than estimated (91 in `Engine.Tests`, 24 in
  `Ui.Tests`, 6 in `Harmonica.Tests`, 1 in `RfCore.Tests`); `brief-em-sweep-performance`'s own
  milestones account for much of the growth past the ~81 recorded below, and M5's accelerator adds the
  last 5 (`AimAccuracyTests`, 5.8 min) — the earlier count of 74 omitted `Harmonica.Tests`'
  own tier entirely; H6 added `InverseSolveCostTests` (3 methods, ~5 s) and
  `HarmonicaDragCostTests` (1 method, ~2 s), and H7 added `HarmonicaGridDragCostTests` (1 method,
  the 61-point grid measurement) and `HarmonicaTestbenchCliTests` (1 method, which launches the real
  `Cli hb` process) — **~5 s together**. The L8/L9 full-wave phases are where nearly all of them came from, because a
  single de-embedded full-wave point costs ~48 s one level and 71.9 s two (and **149.9 s** at the
  two-level-with-vias mesh L9's own phase gate runs on, N = 1,023), so none of those measurements can
  live in the routine tier. **L9's phase gate added 2** (`L9PhaseGateTests.Gate1` 5 m 28 s and
  `Gate2` 6 m 29 s, **11.97 min together, measured alone** — the via-carries-current comparison and the
  two-level degeneracy; their routine counterparts, the three `Gate3Wiring_…` tests, stay in the
  default gate at ~25 ms). **L9e added 7** (`ViaPhysicsTests.T3_1` 54 s — the ℓ/w
  error curve and its convergence sweeps; `AdaptiveSweepTests.T1_2` 16 s / `T4_1` and `T4_2` ~3-4 min
  each — the tolerance curve, the sweep-time measurement and D3's interpolant comparison;
  `PlanarBudgetTests.T4_3` 68 s / `T4_4` ~1 min / `T5_1` 6 s — the run-level memory arithmetic, its
  working-set cross-check and ACA's compression measurement), bringing the opt-in tier to roughly
  40 minutes in total. **The via z-integral follow-up added 3** (`ViaPhysicsTests.T3_1b` 24 s and
  `T3_1c` 1 m 37 s — the subdivision-invariance ladder and the n_z convergence table; `M1_1` 23 s —
  the cost measurement that decided the design), and **re-pointed `T3_1`** from measuring the midpoint
  rule's error to gating the fill's, at 16 s instead of 54 s. **Net ~+2 min.** The older, named ones are: the L8 phase gate
  (`L8PhaseGateTests.Gate1/Gate2/Gate3` × 2 starters, plus
  `EmAcceptanceBudgetTests.R18_WhatTheUserWaitsForAfterSimulate_AtTheShippingMesh`, ~8.5 min together
  — its routine counterpart `Gate3Wiring` stays in the default gate at 2.5 s); the
  500,000-shape `LayoutPerf` TIMED sweeps
  (`LayoutPerformanceBaselineTests.Baseline_500k`/`Baseline_50k` + `R8bCrossoverExperiment`,
  `LayoutLodMergeCacheBenchmarkTests.{LodOnly,Final}_FullExtent_500k` +
  `PathCache_500k_MemoryStaysUnderCap_TimeAndMemoryReported`,
  `LayoutSpatialIndexPerfTests.BulkLoad_500k_BuildTimeRecorded`,
  `LayoutInstanceArrayPerfTests`'s 500k case) plus the handful of `Engine.Tests` loadpull/pursuit
  methods whose individual runtime crosses the threshold (most loadpull/pursuit tests do not and stay
  untagged and routine).
- **Opt in with `dotnet test --settings circuitrf.benchmark.runsettings`, not `--filter`.** This
  SDK's VSTest version ANDs a command-line `--filter` with the project's own `TestCaseFilter` rather
  than overriding it, so `--filter "Category=Benchmark"` resolves to the impossible AND of
  `Category!=Benchmark` and `Category=Benchmark` and silently matches nothing — verified directly, not
  assumed. Passing `--settings` on the command line does override the project-level
  `RunSettingsFilePath` cleanly, so `circuitrf.benchmark.runsettings` (`TestCaseFilter:
  Category=Benchmark`) is the actual one-liner opt-in path. Run it (~5 min) when touching rendering,
  the spatial index, the path/instance caches, or LOD, and at any performance-phase boundary.
- **500k's COUNTER coverage stays in the default gate**, at negligible cost (~5 s total) — this is the
  part that actually catches an algorithmic regression (an accidental O(n)/O(n²) scan that bypasses
  the spatial index): `LayoutSpatialIndexPerfTests.Gated500k_CullingCountersStayCorrect` (one shared
  500k layout PER PROFILE, reused across a full-extent AND a zoomed-in assertion — no timing, no
  warm-up sweep). Verified to actually catch a regression, not just assumed: temporarily disabling the
  spatial-index culling query in `LayoutRenderer.Draw` turns this test red immediately.
- **Tagging a new slow test:** measure it (a TRX run reports per-test duration); if it is at or above
  ~5 s, add `[Trait("Category", "Benchmark")]`. Below that, leave it untagged — it belongs in the
  default gate. A `[Theory]`'s `InlineData` cases can't be tagged individually, so a mixed-cost Theory
  (e.g. `LayoutPerformanceBaselineTests`'s former combined `Baseline`) should be split into separate
  `[Theory]` methods by cost tier so only the slow tier carries the tag.

**Deferred, on purpose, and it must stay visible rather than quietly becoming permanent:** §5.1's 500k
**timing** target is unmet and lives only in `Category=Benchmark` now. L2c's own measured shortfall
(13-15× over the 50 ms floor at full extent) is the reason — closing it needs the tiled raster cache
(L2d), not more per-shape optimization (see L2c's own completion note above). **Re-enabling routine
500k timing coverage is part of L2d's own gate**, when that phase lands; until then,
`Category=Benchmark` via `--settings circuitrf.benchmark.runsettings` is how anyone actively working on
performance checks it.

**Layout/UI work** — the only projects layout work can plausibly touch or break (every layout brief since
L0a carries the guardrail "don't touch `src/Core`, `src/Engine`, `RfCore`"):
```
dotnet test tests/Ui.Tests --no-build
dotnet test tests/Firewall.Tests --no-build
```
Run as two commands — this SDK's `dotnet test` rejects more than one explicit project path in a single
invocation (`MSB1008: Only one project can be specified`).

**The full unfiltered suite still exists** (bypass the default filter with an empty override
`--settings` file, or `--filter "Category=Benchmark|Category!=Benchmark"`) — reach for it only at
genuine phase boundaries, or whenever the complete picture (including the 500k timing sweep) is
actually wanted. It is not what routine `dotnet test` runs, and does not need to be.

Moving `Benchmark` tests to a separate runner outside `dotnet test` discovery entirely (so they
wouldn't even need an opt-in filter) was considered and not done — restructuring the ~19 tagged methods
across 3 files into a standalone project/entry point is more than the brief's "stop and report if not
cheap" threshold, and the `--settings` opt-in already satisfies the brief's gates without it.

Add `--no-build` after the first build of a session.

## Architecture — three layers, kept separate
1. **Design layer** (`src/Core`): Cells (Symbol/Schematic/Layout views), instances, nets,
   parameters, libraries — editable, serialized, human-readable. Layout view is a v1 placeholder.
2. **Elaboration layer** (`src/Core`): flatten hierarchy, resolve parameters/sweeps top-down,
   number nodes → an *elaborated netlist*. This is what the engine consumes.
3. **Numeric layer** (`src/Engine`): matrices, unknown vectors, the `DataSet`/`DataCube` result
   model. No UI, no domain types.

Source map: `src/Core` (layers 1–2 + the expression engine), `src/Engine` (layer 3 + analyses),
`src/RfCore` (Touchstone I/O, network params, `DataSet`/`DataCube`, `.npy` export), `src/Ui`
(Avalonia), `src/Cli` (headless driver + test harness). `RfCore` is an ordinary first-party project
alongside the rest — see §Stack for why it is no longer at the repo root, and why that changed
nothing architecturally.

`tools/` holds programs that are not part of the application. **A program in there that exists to be
tested against deliberately references no other project in this repo** — an independent
implementation of a contract, not a mirror of ours, since a second copy of our own code agreeing with
itself proves nothing:
- `tools/DeviceWorkerExample` — a reference **device worker**, the kind of separate process circuitRF
  runs to evaluate an externally-supplied device model. See its own `README.md` for the protocol and
  for how a kit declares its worker.
- `tools/senior-worker` — the worker circuitRF actually ships, for compiled vendor model libraries.
  One C source file, three products (a Linux executable; on Windows a DLL holding the callbacks plus
  a launcher stub, because a Windows model imports its host callbacks from a *named module*).
- `tools/fake-model-lib` — a test-only library mimicking that model ABI, so the worker can be driven
  end to end on a machine with no vendor kit on it. Not built by `dotnet build`.
- `tools/IconGen` — rasterises `src/Ui/Assets/artwork/*-app-icon.svg` into the `.icns`/`.ico`/`.png`
  containers the three operating systems read. Writes both containers itself (no `iconutil`, no
  ImageMagick), which is what makes packaging work identically on all three. Not in `circuitRF.slnx`,
  so a plain `dotnet build` neither builds it nor restores its `Svg.Skia` dependency.

**UI firewall:** `RfCore`, `src/Core`, `src/Engine`, `src/Cli` must reference **no UI framework**
(no Avalonia) — all UI-framework code lives in `src/Ui`, so circuitRF can be re-skinned by replacing
`src/Ui` only. This is an **enforced** invariant (a CI assembly-reference check fails the build if the
core references Avalonia). Contract across the boundary: design model down, `DataSet` up. See
`docs/design/ui-architecture.md`.

## Invariants — do not violate
- Node 0 is ground.
- All AC / HB signal quantities (voltages, currents, spectra) are `System.Numerics.Complex`
  (double precision). Resolved parameter *values* are kinded **Real or Complex** (not forced
  complex); result cubes are likewise single-kind (`DataKind` Real or Complex).
- **The GUI never simulates the design layer directly — always elaborate first.**
- Never break the linear/nonlinear partition abstraction in the HB engine.
- Every analysis run returns a **`DataSet`** (a named collection of single-kind `DataCube`s);
  nothing invents its own result type. Measurements are added to the DataSet as named cubes.
- The numeric layer sees only fully-resolved parameter values (no expressions, no unbound vars).
- **Analyses attach to a `TestBench`, never to a `Cell`. Measurements also attach to the
  `TestBench`** and reference circuit quantities by absolute downward path (`V(X1.drain)`).

## Expressions, variables & cell parameters
One expression engine (tokenize → Pratt-parse → AST → evaluate; **never string substitution**)
serves global variables, cell parameters, SDD device equations, and measurements. See
`docs/design/expressions.md`.
- Cell parameters pass **top-down**: an instance binds overrides in the parent scope; the cell
  evaluates its own component values and its sub-cell passes in its scope.
- **Cycle detection is mandatory** across variables, cell-parameter defaults, and overrides.
- v1 language: variable refs; `+ - * / ^ ( )`; standard functions (`tan`, `tanh`, …);
  **conditionals** (`< <= > >= == !=`, `&& || !`, `if(cond,then,else)`); user-defined expression
  functions with arbitrary parameters. Values are kinded Real/Complex/Bool. Built to extend
  without breaking v1 files.
- The SDD's equations must stay expressible in an ordinary equation-defined-device form (hero references depend on it).

## How to add a component type
Derive from `ComponentModel` (the single base for passive **and** active parts — "Device" is
reserved for its RF meaning, an active part): declare ports + params, then `Stamp(...)` (linear
contribution — the model *contributes* stamps; the engine *owns* the matrix) and/or `Evaluate(...)`
(nonlinear: returns `i`, `q`, `dg`, `dc`). Register it in the component-model factory. Add a
golden-reference test. See `docs/design/data-model.md` §5.
**The base type must already accommodate the v2 ASM-HEMT/Verilog-A path:** a thermal/self-heating
node, collapsible internal nodes, terminal current, and charge-based capacitances (`q(v)` with
`dq/dv`). The external-device path exercises all four today (`ExternalDeviceModel`, `VerilogA`);
`FetModelBase` does not carry a thermal node of its own.

**Nonlinear devices that exist today: five native large-signal FETs (`FET_Angelov`, `FET_Curtice`,
`FET_CurticeCubic`, `FET_Materka`, `FET_Statz`, all on `FetModelBase` in `src/Core/Devices/Fet/`,
with selectable gate charge via `CapModel` — 0 none, 1 constant Cgs/Cgd, 2 junction), plus `SDD`,
`NonlinearC`, `Diode`, and any externally-supplied model through `ExtDevice`/`VerilogA`.**

> **Corrected 2026-08-06** (brief-harmonicarf-h0-h3 §0.3 item 1 / M6). This paragraph used to say
> that `FetModel` "is a plan, not code" and that a FET in a schematic is an SDD carrying FET
> equations. That has been stale since the FET family landed on 2026-08-02 — the models are
> placeable, have analytic derivatives, their own parameter sets, and 23 gate tests of their own.
> `BjtModel` genuinely does not exist and is deliberately not planned: the bipolar path stays on the
> compiled/external route, because a native implementation is permanent maintenance of someone
> else's physics (see `src/Core/CLAUDE.md`).

## Validation expectations
Numerical changes require a `testdata/` regression test within the tolerance in the PRD.
The five heroes are the acceptance anchors (S-params 1e-6; HB Pout/gain ±0.01 dB, eff/PAE ±0.1 pp;
loadpull contours; two-tone IM2–IM5). References are **externally generated** — produced
independently of circuitRF, then committed as fixed data — with the **identical SDD FET definition
on both sides**, so HB comparisons test our math, not a different transistor. CI runs the
suite on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Ask before
- Adding native (non-managed) dependencies (cross-platform risk).
- Anything marked out-of-scope for v1 in `docs/PRD.md` (transient, full Verilog-A/ASM-HEMT,
  a third-party cell database, layout view).

## Licensing
Core is **MIT**. Never ingest GPL code (some third-party simulators are GPL — learn from, never copy).
Keep a clean extension boundary so a future commercial **circuitRF+** can layer on without forking.

## Glossary
MNA, S-parameters, harmonic balance (HB), conversion matrix, loadpull/sourcepull, APFT, IMn,
DUT, Touchstone/SNP, SDD, OSDI/Verilog-A, `DataSet`/`DataCube`. Terms are defined where they
first appear in `docs/PRD.md` and the `docs/design/` notes.
