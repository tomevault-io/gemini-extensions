## 1. Mathematical Foundations

### 1.1 Ownership Basics

At its core, a cap table is a list of ownership stakes. For any stakeholder:

```
ownershipPct = shares / totalShares
```

All percentages in the library are expressed as decimals (e.g., `0.45` = 45%).

### 1.2 Pre-Money vs Post-Money Valuation

When a priced round occurs, two valuations matter:

- **Pre-money valuation** = The value of the company *before* the new investment.
- **Post-money valuation** = Pre-money + total new investment.

The **price per share (PPS)** for the Series round is derived from the post-money:

```
PPS = postMoneyValuation / totalPostMoneyShares
```

Where `totalPostMoneyShares` includes:
- All existing common shares (founders + issued options)
- Any new shares issued to SAFE investors upon conversion
- Any increase in the options pool (the "refresh")
- Series investor shares

### 1.3 SAFE Conversion Mechanics

A SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity) converts to shares at a priced round. The conversion depends on three variables:

1. **Cap** — the maximum valuation used for conversion
2. **Discount** — a percentage reduction off the Series PPS
3. **Conversion type** — whether the cap applies to pre-money or post-money share count

#### 1.3.1 Pre-Money SAFE

A pre-money SAFE converts based on the pre-money share count:

```
capPPS = cap / preMoneyShares
shares = investment / capPPS
```

Equivalently:

```
shares = (investment / cap) * preMoneyShares
```

The investor's ownership is dilutive — they get shares *before* the new money comes in, so the Series investors dilute them too.

#### 1.3.2 Post-Money SAFE

A post-money SAFE (the Y Combinator standard) guarantees a fixed ownership percentage of the *post-money* cap table:

```
ownershipPct = investment / cap
```

This means the SAFE investor's stake is calculated *after* all conversions but *before* the Series round. Critically, post-money SAFEs are **not diluted** by the Series investors — their ownership percentage is locked in at conversion.

#### 1.3.3 Discount

A discount gives the SAFE investor a lower PPS than the Series investors:

```
discountPPS = (1 - discount) * seriesPPS
```

For example, a 20% discount means `discountPPS = 0.80 * seriesPPS`.

#### 1.3.4 Effective Conversion Price

The SAFE investor always gets the **better** of the cap or the discount:

```
effectivePPS = min(discountPPS, capPPS)
shares = investment / effectivePPS
```

If the cap is `0` (uncapped), only the discount applies:

```
effectivePPS = (1 - discount) * seriesPPS
```

#### 1.3.5 MFN (Most Favored Nation)

An MFN SAFE has no explicit cap but receives the **lowest cap** of any subsequent capped SAFE. This is implemented by scanning all SAFEs that come *after* the MFN SAFE in the list and taking the minimum non-zero cap among post-money SAFEs.

```
mfnCap = min(cap of all subsequent post-money SAFEs where cap > 0)
```

If no subsequent capped SAFE exists, the MFN remains uncapped until one is added.

#### 1.3.6 YC 7% Post-Money

A special case: guarantees exactly 7% ownership post-conversion:

```
ownershipPct = 0.07
```

This is treated as a post-money SAFE with `cap = investment / 0.07`.


### 1.4 The Iterative Solver (`fitConversion`)

The central challenge in cap table math is that **SAFE conversions depend on the total share count, but the total share count depends on SAFE conversions**. This is a circular dependency that requires an iterative solver.

#### Why It's Circular

Consider a post-money SAFE:

```
ownershipPct = investment / cap   // fixed
shares = ownershipPct * totalShares // depends on totalShares
totalShares = commonShares + safeShares + seriesShares + optionsPool // depends on shares
```

You can't solve for `totalShares` algebraically in one step because of rounding and the interaction between pre-money and post-money SAFEs.

#### The Iteration

The solver starts with an initial guess:

```
totalShares = commonShares + unusedOptions
```

Then it repeatedly computes what the total shares *should* be given that guess, and uses the result as the next guess. The iteration converges when the guess stabilizes.

At each iteration, given a `totalShares` guess:

1. **Compute the refreshed options pool:**
   ```
   optionsPool = max(totalShares * targetOptionsPct, unusedOptions)
   ```
   The pool can't shrink below existing unused options.

2. **Compute the increase in the options pool:**
   ```
   increaseInOptionsPool = optionsPool - unusedOptions
   ```

3. **Compute the Series PPS:**
   ```
   seriesPPS = (preMoneyValuation + totalSeriesInvestment) / totalShares
   ```
   Note: the numerator is the post-money valuation.

4. **Compute Series shares (per investor, rounded):**
   ```
   seriesShares_i = round(seriesInvestment_i / seriesPPS)
   totalSeriesShares = sum(seriesShares_i)
   ```

5. **Compute pre-money and post-money share counts:**
   ```
   preMoneyShares = commonShares + unusedOptions + increaseInOptionsPool
   postMoneyShares = totalShares - totalSeriesShares - increaseInOptionsPool
   ```

6. **Convert each SAFE:**
   For each SAFE, compute `effectivePPS` using `safeConvert()` (see §1.3.4), then:
   ```
   safeShares_i = round(investment_i / effectivePPS_i)
   totalSafeShares = sum(safeShares_i)
   ```

7. **Recompute total shares:**
   ```
   newTotalShares = totalSeriesShares + commonShares + optionsPool + totalSafeShares
   ```

8. **Check convergence:**
   If `newTotalShares == totalShares`, the model is stable. Otherwise, set `totalShares = newTotalShares` and repeat.

The loop has a hard cap of 100 iterations. In practice, it converges in 5–15 iterations.

#### Why It Converges

Each iteration adds the missing SAFE shares to the total. Because all share counts are positive and bounded above by the uncapped case, the sequence is monotonically increasing and bounded, so it must converge. Rounding can cause minor oscillation, but once two consecutive iterations produce the same integer share count, convergence is guaranteed.

### 1.5 Option Pool Refresh

The option pool is refreshed to hit a target percentage of the *post-money fully diluted* cap table:

```
targetOptionsPool = totalPostMoneyShares * targetOptionsPct
```

If the existing unused options are already larger than the target, no refresh occurs:

```
actualOptionsPool = max(targetOptionsPool, unusedOptions)
additionalOptions = actualOptionsPool - unusedOptions
```

These additional options dilute everyone (founders, SAFEs, Series investors) proportionally because they're added *before* the Series round but *after* SAFE conversions.

### 1.6 Rounding

Legal cap tables use specific rounding conventions:

- **Share counts** are floored (`Math.floor`) by default. You can't issue fractional shares.
- **Price per share (PPS)** is rounded **up** to a configurable number of decimal places (default: 5). This slightly favors the company by making each share more expensive, reducing the number of shares issued.

These rounding choices affect the iteration because a small change in PPS can change the floored share count, which changes the total, which changes the PPS.

### 1.7 Cap Table Workflows Summary

| Workflow | When to Use | Key Function |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| **Existing shareholders only** | No SAFEs, no priced round | `buildExistingShareholderCapTable` |
| **Estimated pre-round** | SAFEs exist but no priced round yet | `buildEstimatedPreRoundCapTable` |
| **Solved pre-round** | Priced round known, show pre-money ownership | `buildPreRoundCapTable` |
| **Full priced round** | Complete cap table after Series A | `buildPricedRoundCapTable` |

### 2.2 Rounding Utilities (`src/utils/rounding.ts`)

```typescript
export type RoundingStrategy = {
  roundDownShares?: boolean;   // true = floor shares (legal default)
  roundShares?: boolean;       // true = round to nearest (alternative)
  roundPPSPlaces: number;      // Decimal places for PPS; -1 = no rounding
};

// Legal convention: round DOWN shares so you never over-issue
export const roundShares = (num: number, strategy: RoundingStrategy): number => {
  if (strategy.roundDownShares) {
    return Math.floor(num);
  } else if (strategy.roundShares) {
    return Math.round(num);
  }
  return num
}

// Legal convention: round UP PPS so each share costs slightly more,
// reducing the number of shares issued to investors
export const roundPPSToPlaces = (num: number, places: number): number => {
  if (places < 0) {
    return num;
  }
  const factor = Math.pow(10, places);
  return Math.ceil(num * factor) / factor;
};

// General rounding utility (used for output formatting, not calculations)
export const roundToPlaces = (num: number, places: number): number => {
  if (places < 0) {
    return num;
  }
  const factor = Math.pow(10, places);
  return Math.round(num * factor) / factor;
};
```

### 2.3 Number Formatting (`src/utils/numberFormatting.ts`)

```typescript
// Parses strings like "$1.5M", "1,000,000", "$50K" into numbers
export const stringToNumber = (value: string | number): number => {
  if (typeof value === "number") {
    return value;
  } else {
    // Strip non-numeric characters except decimal and negative
    const cleanedValue = value.replace(/[^-\d.]/g, "");
    return cleanedValue.includes(".")
      ? parseFloat(cleanedValue)
      : parseInt(cleanedValue, 10);
  }
};

// Formats as "$1,234,567" or "$1,500.50"
export const formatUSDWithCommas = (value: number | string) => {
  if (typeof value === "string") {
    value = stringToNumber(value);
  }
  const maximumFractionDigits = value < 1000 ? 2 : 0
  return value.toLocaleString("en-US", {
    style: "currency",
    currency: "USD",
    maximumFractionDigits,
  });
};

// Formats as "$1.5M" or "$50K"
export const shortenedUSD = (value: number | string) => {
  if (typeof value === "string") {
    value = stringToNumber(value);
  }
  if (value >= 1_000_000) {
    return "$" + (value / 1_000_000).toFixed(1) + "M";
  } else if (value >= 1_000) {

## 3. Building the Conversational Tool

### 3.1 Conversation Architecture

The tool should branch based on the user's goal. Here's the decision tree:

```
User asks about cap table
│
├─→ "Do you want to model an existing cap table, or a future priced round?"
│   │
│   ├─→ "Existing only" → buildExistingShareholderCapTable
│   │
│   ├─→ "Future priced round" → "Do you know the pre-money valuation?"
│   │   │
│   │   ├─→ "No" → buildEstimatedPreRoundCapTable (SAFEs only, no pricing)
│   │   │
│   │   └─→ "Yes" → fitConversion → buildPreRoundCapTable OR buildPricedRoundCapTable
│   │       │
│   │       ├─→ "Show me pre-money ownership" → buildPreRoundCapTable
│   │       │
│   │       └─→ "Show me the full priced round" → buildPricedRoundCapTable
│   │
│   └─→ "I have SAFEs but no priced round yet" → buildEstimatedPreRoundCapTable
```



### 3.2 Input Gathering Strategy

Use a **hybrid approach**: ask the high-level branching question first, then provide a compact JSON template for bulk data entry.

#### Step 1: Branching Question

> "I can help you model your cap table. Are you looking to:  
> (a) See ownership for existing shareholders only,  
> (b) Model SAFE ownership before a priced round, or  
> (c) Model a full Series A priced round?"

#### Step 2: JSON Template (for bulk entry)

For **existing shareholders only**:
```json
{
  "common": [
    { "name": "Founder 1", "shares": 4500000 },
    { "name": "Founder 2", "shares": 4500000 },
    { "name": "Options Pool", "shares": 1000000, "commonType": "unusedOptions" }
  ]
}
```

For **SAFE modeling** (priced or pre-round):
```json
{
  "common": [
    { "name": "Founder 1", "shares": 4500000 },
    { "name": "Founder 2", "shares": 4500000 },
    { "name": "Issued Options", "shares": 400000 },
    { "name": "Unused Options", "shares": 600000, "commonType": "unusedOptions" }
  ],
  "safes": [
    {
      "name": "Seed SAFE",
      "investment": 1000000,
      "cap": 10000000,
      "discount": 0,
      "conversionType": "post"
    }
  ]
}
```

For **priced round**:
```json
{
  "preMoneyValuation": 25000000,
  "targetOptionsPct": 0.10,
  "seriesInvestments": [3000000, 1000000],
  "common": [ ... ],
  "safes": [ ... ]
}
```

#### Step 3: Interactive follow-ups for complex items

- **MFN ordering**: "You have an MFN SAFE. The order matters — it looks at subsequent SAFEs for the lowest cap. Is this the correct order? [list SAFEs]"
- **Option pool**: "What target option pool % do you want post-round? (Common: 10%)"
- **Discounts**: "I see a discount on a SAFE. Note: I can flag this, but exact ownership requires a priced round."

### 3.3 Error Handling Strategy

#### Pre-validate before calling the library

Check these conditions and refuse to proceed with a clear message:

| Check | Error Message |
|-------|--------------|
| Investment ≥ cap (and cap ≠ 0) | "A SAFE's investment ($X) can't equal or exceed its cap ($Y). Please fix this and try again." |
| Negative shares | "Share counts must be positive." |
| Negative investment | "Investment amounts must be positive." |
| Empty cap table | "Please add at least one shareholder." |
| Target options % > 1 | "Option pool percentage should be a decimal (e.g., 0.10 for 10%)." |

#### Translate library error states conversationally

When the library returns `tbd` or `caveat`, don't crash — explain:

- **`tbd`**: "I can't calculate exact ownership yet because one or more SAFEs don't have a cap. Add a cap or a priced round to see precise numbers."
- **`caveat`**: "This ownership is an estimate. [reason from library]. For exact numbers, add a priced round with a pre-money valuation."
- **`error`**: "There's a problem with the input: [reason]. Please fix it and I'll recalculate."



### 3.4 Output Formatting

#### Default: Markdown Table

```
| Stakeholder | Shares | Investment | Ownership |
|-------------|--------|------------|-----------|
| Founder 1 | 4,500,000 | — | 45.00% |
| Seed SAFE | 555,556 | $1,000,000 | 5.56% |
| Series A | 1,230,769 | $4,000,000 | 12.31% |
| **Total** | **10,000,000** | **$5,000,000** | **100.00%** |
```

#### Alternative: Compact JSON

For users who want raw data:
```json
{
  "common": [...],
  "safes": [...],
  "series": [...],
  "refreshedOptionsPool": {...},
  "total": {...}
}
```

#### Key Stats Summary

Always include a human-readable summary:

> **Summary:**
> - Pre-money valuation: $25M
> - Post-money valuation: $29M
> - Series PPS: $3.25
> - Total fully diluted shares: 10,000,000
> - New options issued: 400,000

### 3.5 Quick Reference: Function Call Cheat Sheet

| Goal | Call This | With These Inputs |
|------|-----------|-------------------|
| Existing ownership only | `buildExistingShareholderCapTable(commonStockholders)` | Array of `CommonStockholder` |
| Estimate SAFE ownership | `buildEstimatedPreRoundCapTable(stakeHolders)` | Array of `CommonStockholder` + `SAFENote` |
| Exact pre-round ownership | `buildPreRoundCapTable(bestFit, stakeHolders)` | Output of `fitConversion` + stakeholders |
| Full priced round | `buildPricedRoundCapTable(bestFit, stakeHolders)` | Output of `fitConversion` + stakeholders |

**To get a `BestFit`:**
```typescript
const bestFit = fitConversion(
  preMoneyValuation,      // e.g., 25_000_000
  commonShares,           // e.g., 9_000_000 (excludes unused options)
  safes,                  // Array of SAFENote
  unusedOptions,          // e.g., 1_000_000
  targetOptionsPct,       // e.g., 0.10
  seriesInvestments       // e.g., [3_000_000, 1_000_000]
);
```

### 3.6 Edge Cases to Handle in Conversation

1. **All uncapped SAFEs**: The estimated pre-round will return `tbd`. Tell the user: "I need at least one capped SAFE or a priced round to estimate ownership."

2. **Zero founders**: Unusual but valid. The entire company is owned by SAFE/series investors.

3. **100% option pool**: Mathematically possible but practically suspicious. Flag it.

4. **Very small cap relative to investment**: Will trigger `error`. Catch it early.

5. **Multiple Series rounds**: The library supports `round: number` on `SeriesInvestor`. Most chat tools will only model round 0 (the immediate next round).

6. **Re-ordering SAFEs for MFN**: If the user has MFNs, ask them to confirm the chronological order. The MFN looks at *subsequent* SAFEs only.
