# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working with Founder OS.

## Project Overview

Founder OS is a single-plugin AI automation ecosystem for SMB founders, built on Claude Code using the official Anthropic plugin format. 32 command namespaces cover email triage, meeting prep, report generation, CRM sync, and more — all invoked as `/founder-os:namespace:action`.

## Architecture

### Single Plugin Structure

Founder OS ships as one Anthropic-compatible plugin at the repository root:
```
founderOS/
├── .claude-plugin/
│   └── plugin.json           # Single plugin manifest
├── .mcp.json                 # MCP server connections
├── commands/
│   └── [namespace]/          # One directory per namespace
│       └── [action].md       # Slash command (e.g., commands/inbox/triage.md)
├── skills/
│   └── [namespace]/
│       └── [skill-name]/
│           └── SKILL.md      # Domain knowledge
├── agents/
│   └── [namespace]/          # Agent Teams (Priority 5 namespaces)
│       └── *.md
├── _infrastructure/          # Shared skills, templates, MCP configs
└── _templates/               # Scaffolding and examples
```

Commands are invoked as `/founder-os:namespace:action` (e.g., `/founder-os:inbox:triage`).

### Four Pillars

| Pillar | Emoji | Namespaces | Focus |
|--------|-------|---------|-------|
| Daily Work | 📧 | #01-#08 | Email, meetings, reviews |
| Code Without Coding | 🛠️ | #09-#16 | Reports, invoices, contracts |
| MCP & Integrations | 🔌 | #17-#24 | Notion, Drive, Slack, CRM |
| Meta & Growth | 📈 | #25-#32 | ROI, workflows, templates, memory, intelligence |

### Platform

All 32 namespaces run as a single plugin on **Claude Code**. The `"platform": "claude-code"` field in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` confirms this.

### Agent Teams Patterns (Priority 5 namespaces)

| Pattern | Used By | How It Works |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| Pipeline | #01 Inbox Zero, #09 Report Gen | Sequential: Input → Agent A → Agent B → Output |
| Parallel Gathering | #02 Daily Briefing, #03 Meeting Prep, #20 Client Context | All agents fetch simultaneously, lead merges |
| Pipeline + Batch | #11 Invoice Processor | Pipeline per item, batch across items |
| Competing Hypotheses | #14 SOW Generator | Multiple agents propose, lead synthesizes |

### Autonomous Spectrum

Namespaces operate at different autonomy levels:

| Level | Trigger | Examples |
|-------|---------|---------|
| Interactive | User runs command | All 32 namespaces (default) |
| Scheduled | Cron/timer | P02, P05, P06, P10, P18, P19, P21, P22, P29 (via `--schedule`) |
| Workflow | P27 orchestration | Any namespace via `/founder-os:workflow:create` |

## MCP Servers & External Tools

The plugin uses these MCP servers and tools (install in priority order):

1. **Notion** MCP (21 namespaces) - CRM backbone, task tracking, output storage
2. **gws CLI** (20 namespaces) - Gmail, Calendar, and Drive access via `gws` CLI tool. Install once, authenticate with `gws auth login`. No per-namespace config needed.
3. **Filesystem** MCP (8 namespaces) - Local file processing, document generation
4. **Slack** MCP (2 namespaces) - Team communication digests
5. **Web Search** MCP (1 namespace) - Competitive research

### MCP Package Names
- Notion: `@modelcontextprotocol/server-notion`
- Filesystem: `@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem`
- Gmail/Calendar/Drive: **Use `gws` CLI** (not MCP servers). See `_infrastructure/gws-skills/`.

## Key Decisions

| Topic | Decision |
|-------|----------|
| CRM | Notion (not HubSpot/Pipedrive) |
| Voice transcription | Whisper (local, free, privacy-first) |
| Morning sync tools | Gmail + Calendar + Notion + Slack + Drive |
| Time savings tracking | Pre-defined task type estimates (not manual input) |
| Client health metrics | 5 scores 0-100: contact, response, tasks, payment, sentiment |

## Namespace Quick Reference (all 32 namespaces)

Each namespace's own files (SKILL.md, commands/, agents/) contain full implementation details. Read those when working with a specific namespace.

## Infrastructure Commands

Shared commands that live under `_infrastructure/`. Discovered via this section (not via plugin manifests).

| Command | File | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| `/context:setup` | `_infrastructure/context/commands/context-setup.md` | Set up business context files via guided interview |
| `/audit:scan` | `_infrastructure/automation-audit/commands/audit-scan.md` | Scan plugin deployment and coverage |
| `/audit:report` | `_infrastructure/automation-audit/commands/audit-report.md` | Generate detailed automation scorecard |

## Conventions

- Commands: `commands/[namespace]/[action].md` invoked as `/founder-os:namespace:action`
- Skills: `skills/[namespace]/[skill-name]/SKILL.md`
- Agents: `agents/[namespace]/*.md`
- Slash commands: `/founder-os:namespace:action` (e.g., `/founder-os:inbox:triage`, `/founder-os:client:load`)
- Skills are markdown files describing domain knowledge
- Commands are markdown files describing slash command behavior
- Agent definitions are markdown files with role, tools, and instructions

### Universal Patterns (apply to ALL namespaces)
- **HQ DB discovery** — search "[FOS] [Name]" first, then "Founder OS HQ - [Name]", then namespace-specific legacy DB name (backward compat)
- **No lazy DB creation** — databases are pre-created in the HQ template; only fall back to lazy creation for non-HQ users
- **Type column** — every write to a merged DB MUST include the correct Type value (e.g., Type="Email Task" for P01 → Tasks DB)
- **Company relation** — populate when client context is available (email domain match, user input, CRM lookup)
- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` for all file paths in plugin markdown (portability)
- Graceful degradation — optional MCP sources return `status: "unavailable"`, never error
- Dual-mode commands — default fast single-agent mode + `--team` flag for full agent pipeline
- Idempotent re-runs — update existing output, never duplicate; add Type to compound keys for merged DBs
- `status: "complete"` standardized across all agent outputs
- **Business context loading** — all 32 namespaces check `_infrastructure/context/active/` for business context files at command start. See `_infrastructure/context/SKILL.md`.
- **Scheduling support** — 9 namespaces accept `--schedule "expression"` flag for recurring execution. Generates P27 workflows automatically. Supported: P02, P05, P06, P10, P18, P19, P21, P22, P29. See `_infrastructure/scheduling/SKILL.md`.
- **Memory integration** — all 32 namespaces inject relevant memories at start (Step 0) and log observations at end (Final step). See `_infrastructure/memory/SKILL.md`.

## Memory Engine

Cross-namespace shared memory with adaptive behavior. Two components:

- **Infrastructure** (`_infrastructure/memory/`): 3 shared skills — core memory API, context injection, pattern detection
- **Commands**: User-facing commands `/founder-os:memory:show`, `/founder-os:memory:teach`, `/founder-os:memory:forget`, `/founder-os:memory:sync`
- **Notion DB**: `[FOS] Memory` in HQ template — syncs with local SQLite store

**How it works**: Before any command runs, the context-injection skill queries the local memory store and injects the top 5 relevant memories. After execution, the pattern-detection skill logs observations and promotes patterns to memories when confidence reaches threshold. Auto-adaptations apply after 3+ confirmations and notify the user.

**Local store**: `.memory/memory.db` (SQLite + HNSW). Auto-initializes on first use.

## Notion HQ Template

The Founder OS HQ is a consolidated Notion workspace template with 22 interconnected databases. CRM Companies is the central hub — all client-facing databases relate back to it.

### Workspace Structure
```
Founder OS HQ
├── Command Center (Dashboard)
├── CRM: Companies, Contacts, Deals, Communications
├── Operations: Tasks, Meetings, Finance
├── Intelligence: Briefings, Knowledge Base, Research, Reports
├── Content & Deliverables: Content, Deliverables, Prompts
└── Growth & Meta: Goals, Milestones, Learnings, Weekly Insights, Workflows, Activity Log, Memory
```

### Database Consolidation Map
