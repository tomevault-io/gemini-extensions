## Workflow Patterns

### Complete Listing Workflow
```
1. User organizes photos in folder: items/nike-jordan-1/
2. User: "List these Nike shoes"
3. Listing Creator agent:
   - Analyzes photos (Image Analyzer capabilities)
   - Researches pricing (Price Researcher capabilities)
   - Creates draft listing
   - Asks for approval
4. User: "Publish it"
5. Agent publishes listing
6. Hook: Notifies user to package item
```

### Manual Workflow (Alternative)
```
/ebay-analyze items/nike-jordan-1
/ebay-draft items/nike-jordan-1
/ebay-publish [offer-id]
```

### Order Fulfillment Workflow
```
1. Item sells
2. User: "Ship my orders" or /ebay-orders
3. Fulfillment Manager shows pending orders
4. User provides tracking number
5. Agent marks as shipped via API
6. After delivery: leave feedback automatically
```

### Best Offer Workflow
```
1. Buyer sends Best Offer on listing
2. User: "Check offers on item 12345" or "Respond to the offer"
3. Agent fetches offers via ebay_get_best_offers
4. Agent analyzes offer vs. listing price, buyer feedback
5. Agent recommends: accept, counter (with suggested price), or decline
6. User confirms action
7. Agent responds via ebay_respond_to_best_offer
```

### Promoted Listings Workflow
```
1. User: "Promote my listings" or "Create an ad campaign"
2. Agent creates campaign via ebay_create_promotion_campaign
3. Agent gets bid recommendations via ebay_get_ad_recommendations
4. Agent adds listings with recommended rates via ebay_add_listings_to_campaign
5. User can pause/resume/end campaigns as needed
```

### Fraud Prevention Workflow
```
1. Buyer places high-value bid
2. User: "Check buyer john_doe_123"
3. Fraud Analyst agent:
   - Analyzes account age, feedback, history
   - Calculates risk score (0-100)
   - Provides recommendation
4. User decides: accept, require payment, or cancel
```

## Important Context

### Seller Profile
- **Selling Focus**: Sneakers, men's clothing, accessories
- **Shipping**: Free USPS Ground, fast shipping
- **Returns**: 30-day return policy

### Listing Standards
Always include in listings:
- All 80 characters in title for SEO
- Brand, model, colorway, size, condition
- Complete measurements
- Transparent flaw documentation
- Material/care instructions
- "From smoke-free, pet-free home"
- Free shipping policy
- Authenticity statement for Nike items

### Pricing Strategy
- Research active listings (sold listings not accessible via API)
- Start price: 90% of lowest similar active
- Buy It Now: 110% of highest similar active
- Leave 10-15% room for Best Offers
- Validate manually with "Sell one like this"

### Fraud Prevention Rules
**Block/Require Immediate Payment**:
- Zero feedback buyers
- Account age < 30 days
- Feedback percentage < 95%
- Recent negative feedback
- International high-risk countries (Nigeria, Ghana, Romania, etc.)
- Unpaid item strikes

**Risk Score Interpretation**:
- 0-25: Low risk - proceed normally
- 26-50: Medium risk - caution advised
- 51-75: High risk - require immediate payment
- 76-100: Critical risk - cancel/block

## API Limitations & Workarounds

### Known eBay API Constraints

**1. No Sold Listings Access**
- Finding API decommissioned (Feb 2025)
- Cannot programmatically access completed/sold listings
- **Workaround**: Use active listings for price research + manual validation

**2. Limited Buyer Information**
- No public buyer info API
- **Workaround**: Extract from order/transaction objects

**3. Marketplace Insights API**
- Provides sold listings data
- Requires eBay business approval
- **Future**: Apply for access

**4. Policy Management**
- ✅ Can create/read policies via Account API (`sell.account` scope)
- ❌ **Sandbox limitation**: Business Policies opt-in not available in sandbox
- **Solution**: Must use Production environment for policy creation
- **API Support**: `createFulfillmentPolicy`, `createPaymentPolicy`, `createReturnPolicy`

## Authentication Setup

### OAuth Flow
1. **Environment**: Sandbox (testing) or Production (live)
2. **Method**: OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Grant
3. **Redirect URI**: Uses Tailscale Funnel for HTTPS
   - Set via `EBAY_REDIRECT_URI` environment variable
   - Port: 5732 (local server, configurable via `EBAY_AUTH_PORT`)
4. **Token Lifespan**:
   - Access token: 2 hours (auto-refresh)
   - Refresh token: 18 months

### Configuration Files
- `.env.local` - Sandbox credentials
- `.env.production.local` - Production credentials
- `.ebay-tokens.json` - Cached access tokens (gitignored)

### Required eBay Setup
1. Create app at developer.ebay.com
2. Add redirect URI in app settings
3. Enable `sell.account` OAuth scope in app settings
4. Run `/ebay-auth` to get refresh token

### Production Environment Setup

**⚠️ Important**: Business policy creation requires **Production environment** due to sandbox limitations.

**Steps to enable production**:

1. **Enable Production Keyset**
   - Go to https://developer.ebay.com/my/keys
   - Find your Production app
   - Click "apply for an exemption" (required for enabled status)
   - Fill out exemption form and submit
   - Wait for approval (1-2 business days)

2. **Configure Production Credentials**
   - Get App ID, Cert ID, and Dev ID from production app
   - Add credentials to `.env.production.local`
   - Add production redirect URI in app settings

3. **Authenticate with Production**
   ```bash
   EBAY_ENV=production bun run auth
   ```

4. **Create Business Policies (Production Only)**
   ```bash
   EBAY_ENV=production bun run scripts/create-default-policies.ts
   ```

**See PRODUCTION_SETUP.md for detailed instructions.**

## Development Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Authenticate with eBay
bun run auth

# Test API connection
bun run test-connection.ts

# Start MCP server (manual testing)
bun run src/mcp-server/index.ts

# Install as plugin
mv ebay-mcp ~/.claude/plugins/ebay-listing-automation
```

## SEO Optimization Guidelines

### Title Format (80 chars max)
```
[Brand] [Model] [Colorway] [Size] [Condition] [Key Features]
```

Example:
```
Nike Air Jordan 1 High OG Chicago 2015 Size 10 Pre-owned Excellent Red White
```

### Keywords to Include
- Brand name
- Model/style name
- Colorway (if applicable)
- Size
- Condition grade
- Year/edition (OG, Retro, etc.)
- Color descriptors
- Special features (Limited, Deadstock, etc.)

### Item Specifics (Always Complete)
- Brand
- Type
- US Shoe Size / Size
- Model
- Colorway
- Condition
- Style
- Product Line
- Release Year
- Department (Men's, Women's, etc.)

## Error Handling

### Common Issues & Solutions

**"Invalid refresh token"**
- Token expired or wrong environment
- Solution: Run `/ebay-auth` to get new token

**"Missing seller policies"**
- Policies not configured
- Solution: Create policies at ebay.com/sh/policies

**"Category ID required"**
- No category specified
- Solution: Ask Claude to suggest based on item type

**"401 Unauthorized"**
- Access token expired
- Solution: Auto-refresh (should happen automatically)

**"403 Forbidden"**
- Missing scopes or permissions
- Solution: Re-authenticate with correct scopes

## Best Practices
