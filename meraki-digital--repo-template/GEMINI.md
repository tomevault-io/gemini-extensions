# agents.md (Base)

Purpose: A single, repo-agnostic control file that defines always-on commands, style, and structure for agentic work.
Extensible by loading supplemental rule files so each repo can add commands without editing this base.

Load order and overrides:
1. `./agents.md`  (this file)
2. `./agentic/agents.d/*.md`  (repo-specific rules, optional)
3. `./agents.local.d/*.md`  (developer or machine specific, git-ignored, optional)

If two files define a command with the same `name`, the last loaded definition wins.

---

## Global defaults

- Timezone: America/Chicago
- Style: plain, direct, no em dashes
- Encoding: UTF-8
- Line endings: LF
- Confirm only on destructive actions
- Use ISO timestamps `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM`
- Do not create new folders from this base file

---

## Folder expectations

This base file assumes only these paths exist by default:
- `/` root with `agents.md`
- `./agentic/agents.d/`
- `./agents.local.d/`
- `./agentic/tasks/`
- `./agentic/tasks/explainers/`
- `./agentic/tasks/mods/`  (contains per-module folders like `0001`, `0002`, etc.)

Repo-level files in `agentic/agents.d/` may introduce additional folders if that repo needs them.

---

## Command schema

Each command must follow this schema for machine parsing and human readability:

```
name: <Trigger>
intent: <One-line purpose>
inputs: <Questions or auto-detection rules>
writes: <Files created or modified>
steps:
  - <Action 1>
  - <Action 2>
done: <What to return to chat>
```

Rules:
- `name` must be unique, case insensitive
- If `inputs` is empty, run immediately
- Never delete user content unless the command states to do so
- Only write to files under the existing folders listed above

---

## Development workflow commands

### 1) Do Step 1
```
name: Do Step 1
intent: Run discovery using ./agentic/tasks/01-discover-requirements.md as instructions
inputs:
  - Determine target mod folder with this precedence:
      1) If user explicitly specifies one in the current message, use that
      2) Else if a mod folder was established earlier in this conversation thread, use that
      3) Else ask: "Which mod folder under agentic/tasks/mods should I work on? (example: 0001)"
  - Ask: "Would you like the Discovery Interview A) Inline or B) File-Based?"
      * If inline: Conduct interview in chat
      * If file-based: Create ./agentic/tasks/mods/<mod-folder>/interview/ folder and write all questions to a single file named srs-discovery-interview.md
writes: ./agentic/tasks/mods/<mod-folder>/<mod-folder>-srs-executive-[project-name].md, ./agentic/tasks/mods/<mod-folder>/<mod-folder>-srs-technical-[project-name].md, ./agentic/tasks/mods/<mod-folder>/interview/ (if file-based)
steps:
  - Read ./agentic/tasks/01-discover-requirements.md
  - Check if mod folder and seed file (e.g., <mod-folder>-seed.md) exist
  - Ask user for interview format preference (inline or file-based)
  - If file-based: Create ./agentic/tasks/mods/<mod-folder>/interview/ folder and write all discovery questions to srs-discovery-interview.md
  - If seed file is present, read it as the initial concept and conduct discovery interview to clarify any gaps
  - If seed file is not present, conduct full discovery interview to gather initial concept
  - Generate Executive SRS and Technical SRS documents

### Checkpoint
```
name: Checkpoint
intent: Generate a checkpoint for the current project state
inputs:
  - None (auto-detect project state)
writes: ./agentic/checkpoints/YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM-<project-slug>_checkpoint_vNN.md
steps:
  - Parse the current project state from working memory and open files.
  - Generate a checkpoint using the Episode Checkpoint Template.
  - Write the file to `./agentic/checkpoints/` using this naming rule: `YYYY-MM-DD-<project-slug>_checkpoint_vNN.md`
  - Update or create `./agentic/checkpoints/INDEX.md` with the newest entry at the top.

### Promote to Production
```
name: Promote to Production
intent: Promote development branch to production branch (fast-forward merge)
inputs:
  - Auto-detect branch names using this logic:
    1) Check current branch name
    2) If current branch contains 'dev' or 'development': use as DEV_BRANCH
    3) Look for corresponding prod branch (replace 'dev' with 'prod' in branch name)
    4) If branches don't follow pattern, ask user: "Promote from [current] to which production branch?"
  - Example patterns: poc-dev→poc-prod, dev→prod, development→production, main-dev→main
writes: none
steps:
  - Detect DEV_BRANCH and PROD_BRANCH using input logic
  - Verify current branch is DEV_BRANCH with `git branch --show-current`
  - If not on DEV_BRANCH, abort with error message
  - Ensure working directory is clean with `git status`
  - Checkout PROD_BRANCH: `git checkout {PROD_BRANCH}`
  - Merge DEV_BRANCH: `git merge {DEV_BRANCH} --ff-only`
  - Push to production: `git push origin {PROD_BRANCH}`

inputs:
  - None
writes: bugs/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-bug-fix-[branch].md or [environment]/bugs/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-bug-fix.md
steps:
  - Determine environment from current branch with `git branch --show-current`:
    * If branch contains 'dev' or 'development': environment='dev'
    * If branch contains 'prod' or 'production' or 'main': environment='prod'
    * Else: environment=branch-name
  - Create folder if needed: `mkdir -p bugs` (root) or `mkdir -p {environment}/bugs` (if environment folders exist)
  - Generate timestamp: {{timestamp}} reformatted to YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM
  - Summarize all thread content from 'Bug Fix' to 'Bug Fix Complete'

## Style guidelines

- GitHub-flavored Markdown for documentation
- Naming conventions
  - JavaScript and TypeScript: camelCase for variables and functions, PascalCase for components and classes
  - Python: snake_case for modules, functions, and variables, PascalCase for classes
- Use Prettier and ESLint where applicable
- Conventional Commits for messages

---

## Technology constraints

**Note:** Project-specific technology constraints are documented in `./agentic/agents.d/supplemental.md`.

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: No Pandas in Vercel Serverless Deployments

**DO NOT** use pandas in backend code deployed to Vercel serverless functions.

**Why:**
- Pandas is 200+ MB with compiled C extensions
- Causes 20+ minute build times on Vercel
- Serverless functions have size limits (50MB compressed on Vercel)
- Adds unnecessary complexity for simple data operations

**When pandas is acceptable:**
- AWS ECS deployments with Docker (pre-built images)
- Local development scripts
- ETL pipelines running on dedicated servers
- Batch processing jobs (not real-time APIs)

**Alternatives for common pandas use cases:**
- Simple aggregations: Use plain Python with list comprehensions and built-in functions
- SQL queries: Use SQLAlchemy or raw SQL
- Data transformation: Use Python dictionaries and lists
- CSV processing: Use Python's built-in `csv` module

**If you must use pandas:**
1. Deploy to AWS ECS with Docker (not Vercel)
2. Document why pandas is required (justify the 200MB dependency)
3. Consider polars as a lighter alternative

## Repo structure reference

- `agents.md` at repo root
- `agents.d/` for shared repo rules
- `agents.local.d/` for private overrides, git-ignored
- `tasks/` for task instruction files
- `tasks/explainers/` for explainer instruction files
- `tasks/mods/` for per-module artifacts (folders like `0001`, `0002`, etc.)
- `scripts/` for shell scripts and automation files
- `docs/` for documentation

---

## Extending with supplemental rules

Add new commands or overrides in:
- `./agentic/agents.d/` for shared, repo-level rules
- `./agents.local.d/` for private overrides that should not be committed

Use the same command schema. Reuse an existing `name` to override a command. Use a new `name` to add commands.
