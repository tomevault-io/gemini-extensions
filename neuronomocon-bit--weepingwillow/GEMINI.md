# WEEPING WILLOW — PROJECT STATUS & CONTEXT

## What This Project Is

A horror/sci-fi novel series called **Weeping Willow**. First three books:
- **Weeping Willow: The Absence** (Book 1)
- **Weeping Willow: The Hunger** (Book 2)
- **Weeping Willow: The Silence** (Book 3)

Series name is "Weeping Willow" — NOT "trilogy." Keeps the door open for future books.

## Workflow

- **Claude** handles: planning, scaffolding, series bible, chapter drafting (Book 2 onward), chapter review/audit, continuity tracking
- **Book 1** prose was drafted by ChatGPT. As of Book 2 (2026-05-14), ChatGPT was dropped — it could not reliably hold the prose hard rules — and **Claude drafts the chapters directly.** `series-bible/12-chatgpt-system-prompt.md` is retained as a consolidated rules reference.
- **Process:** Claude drafts a chapter into `chapter_review.md` → author proofreads/edits → on approval the final is saved to `chapters-book2/` and an "As Written" block is added to the brief.

**Book 1 — The Absence: COMPLETE (23,405 words / novella)**

**Book 1 — Full proofread/polish pass: COMPLETE (2026-04-04)**
- Question mark convention enforced: Iris/Taken characters use periods on questions (flat affect), warm characters (Rourke, Kade, Lena, Leah) use question marks. Pre-Taking Caleb Ch11 intentionally uses periods as foreshadowing.
- "Not X. Not Y. Z." pattern varied in densest stretch (Ch19-21)
- Duplicate phrase ("She held the contradiction") fixed in Ch15
- Fear-check formula trimmed from 5 to 2 full instances in Act III (Ch17 + Ch22 final); 3 middle instances varied
- Ch19 tightened (~90 lines consolidated)
- Ch7 As Written block reconciled with actual prose

**Book 1 — Deep audit pass: COMPLETE (2026-04-08)**
- 1 typo fixed (Ch1 "dim" → "Dim")
- Lila (Ch4) question mark corrected to period (Taken convention)
- Pre-Taking Caleb Ch11: 5 remaining question marks converted to periods (foreshadowing)
- Kade question marks fixed in Ch7 (3), Ch8 (3), Ch16 (1) — warm character convention
- Ch19 triplet density reduced: removed "Not inferred. Not concluded." (two full triplets within 6 lines → one)
- Ch22 duplicate phrasing varied: "The delay reduced. / Not removed. / Reduced." (identical to Ch21) → "The delay loosened. / Still present. / Less."
- Ch22 restored "alive" in "closer to Willow than anyone else alive" per brief
- Ch22 added missing brief beat: "She did not know which of those should frighten her."
- As Written blocks corrected: Ch20 head-tilt quote, Ch21 phantom negations removed, Ch19 device vibration attribution clarified, Ch22 updated to match new prose
- Individual chapter files saved in `chapters/` folder

**Book 1 — Chapter file review pass: COMPLETE (2026-04-10)**
Reviewing individual chapter files against briefs, audit notes, and conventions. Fixes applied to both `chapters/` files and `chapter_review.md`.
- Punctuation convention refined: full-sentence questions now use question marks for all characters (including flat-affect); short/tonal probes ("How." / "Why." / "Pain.") keep periods. Dialogue tags use "said" not "asked" for flat-affect characters.
- Device/terminal readouts reformatted: inline with colon + italic, not stacked on separate lines
- Ch1: continuity fix ("drove out through the gap in the fence" → "pulled out onto the road" — van parked outside perimeter), scene break added, 5 device readouts inlined
- Ch2: job spec inlined, scene break added, "Local copies," she asked → she said
- Ch3: case file inlined, scene break added, 6 "asked"→"said" fixes, 9 full-sentence questions got question marks, Kade "What."→"What?"
- Ch4: 30 punctuation fixes (full-sentence questions + asked→said + Lila "Yes?"→"Yes."), no scene break needed
- Ch5: 2 full-sentence questions got question marks, 1 split-dialogue question mark, 2 asked→said fixes
- Ch6: 3 full-sentence questions got question marks, 3 asked→said fixes, 1 short/tonal tag removed ("Why," she asked. → "Why.")
- Ch7: "What am I looking at?"→"What are you seeing?" (audio-only call fix), removed ACT II header from chapter file
- Ch8: 2 Iris full-sentence questions got question marks ("What is it?" "What was it?"), 2 Kade questions got question marks ("Alone?" "What?")
- Ch9: 1 fix — "one asked"→"one said" (unnamed flat character). Flat periods on ambient dialogue left intentionally (city-flattening effect)
- Ch10: clean — no fixes needed
- Ch11: 3 asked→said fixes (2 pre-Taking Caleb foreshadowing, 1 Iris), removed malformed "He asked." tag
- Ch12: 1 fix — device readout inlined (Caleb's post-Taking log note)
- Ch13: 3 full-sentence questions got question marks, 1 asked→said, "Just present."→"Functional." (avoided Ch10 repetition)
- Ch14: clean — no fixes needed
- Ch15: clean — no fixes needed
- Ch16: 2 Kade questions got question marks ("And that makes this one thing?" "Where?"), removed ACT III header from chapter file

## Book 2 — "The Hunger"

**Status:** Drafting. Outline in `series-bible/06-book2-outline.md`; 22 chapter briefs in `series-bible/08-book2-chapter-briefs.md`. Per-chapter draft/review status tracked in `review-progress.md`. Approved chapter files saved to `chapters-book2/`.

**Prose pivot (adopted 2026-05-14):** Book 2 onward follows the **SENTENCE VARIETY** and **PROSE CONVENTIONS (HARD RULES)** sections in `series-bible/03-themes-and-tone.md` (mirrored in `12-chatgpt-system-prompt.md`). This is a deliberate craft step up from Book 1: no default single-line fragmentation, no "Not X. Just Y." contrast cadence, no "wrong"/"off" as shorthand, no "nodded once," no labeled pauses, no em dashes, no AI-writing tics, no repeated comparative crutches ("the way…"). Rule set ported from the `deadtransit` project. Book 1 — The Absence is published and stays as written; do not retro-edit it.

**Current state:** Ch1 — Aftermath drafted by Claude, in `chapter_review.md`, awaiting author proofread. Next: author proofreads Ch1 → on approval, save to `chapters-book2/01-aftermath.md` + add As Written block → draft Ch2 — Pattern Shift.

## How to Review a Chapter

When user says a chapter is in `chapter_review.md`:

1. Read the chapter
2. Read the corresponding brief in `series-bible/05-book1-chapter-briefs.md` (or 08/09 for Books 2/3)
3. Audit against:
   - Brief compliance (POV, location, goal, conflict, outcome, emotional beat)
   - Tone compliance (see `03-themes-and-tone.md`: grounded, quiet, absence-as-horror, no spectacle)
   - Character voice consistency (see `02-characters.md`)
   - Willow's physical rules (if applicable)
   - Continuity with prior chapters (check "As Written" blocks in earlier briefs)
   - **PROSE HARD RULES check (Book 2 onward):** Audit against every item in `03-themes-and-tone.md` → PROSE CONVENTIONS (HARD RULES). Sweep explicitly for: AI-writing tics, "it's not X, it's Y" contrast framing, "wrong"/"off" as atmospheric shorthand, "the kind of…" / appositive-as-thesis, labeled silences, "nodded once," narrator editorializing.
   - **Sentence variety check (Book 2 onward):** Flag pages where single-line fragments stack as default prose, or environmental description reads as a checklist instead of flowing sentences. Fragments are emphasis only. Apply the read-aloud test.
   - **Bloat & repetition pass:** Flag prose that doesn't earn its space, and any image/observation/thesis that lands twice without evolution. Recurring beats (fear-checks, "Expected/Observed" logs) must vary or advance — never repeat verbatim.
4. Flag any issues: name conflicts, tone drift, missing beats, continuity breaks, hard-rule violations
5. After approval, add an "As Written" block to the chapter brief with key prose details
6. Commit and push when asked

> **Book 1 note:** The Absence was written before the hard rules and is published — its sparser, more fragmented voice is intentional and stays. The PROSE HARD RULES and sentence-variety checks apply to Book 2 onward only.

## Editing Passes

Each book runs five passes after drafting (the structure Book 1 used, now codified):

1. **First-pass revision** — general quality. Tone drift, pacing, scene-level issues.
2. **Continuity check** — cross-reference all chapters against briefs, bible, and "As Written" blocks. Character knowledge state, timeline, location consistency.
3. **Proofread/polish pass** — punctuation convention enforcement, recurring-pattern variation, duplicate-phrase detection, density trimming.
4. **Deep audit pass** — typo sweep, convention enforcement, PROSE HARD RULES enforcement, "As Written" blocks reconciled.
5. **Chapter file review pass** — individual chapter files reviewed against briefs, final formatting, saved to `chapters/`.

## Drift Corrections

Common drift patterns when ChatGPT drafts, and the correction to give:

- **Too dramatic:** "Pull back. Flatter. Iris doesn't feel this intensely. Underplay it."
- **Too much dialogue:** "Less talking. More silence. Let the scene sit."
- **Too explanatory:** "Cut the exposition. Trust the reader."
- **Willow too villainous:** "Willow is calm. Observational. She believes she's right."
- **Too much action:** "Slow this down. The tension is in proximity, not movement."
- **Purple prose:** "Simpler language. Observations, not performances."
- **Fragmented / staccato prose (CRITICAL):** "Stop writing in single-line fragments as default. Descriptions and environments need full, joined, varied sentences. Fragments are emphasis only. If a page reads like a list, rewrite it."
- **"It's not X, it's Y" framing:** "Retired. State the affirmation directly. Don't set it up with negations."
- **"Wrong"/"off" as shorthand:** "Show the specific discrepancy. The reader names the wrongness, not the prose."
- **AI-writing tics:** "Read `03-themes-and-tone.md` → PROSE HARD RULES. Strip every tic. Replace with direct observation."
- **Duplicate reflection blocks:** "Don't repeat internal monologue verbatim across chapters. Compress or evolve the callback — one sentence."

## Key Continuity Notes

- **Question mark convention:** Iris and Taken characters use periods on dialogue questions (flat affect). Warm/emotional characters (Rourke, Kade, Lena, Leah, pre-Taking Caleb) use question marks. Exception: pre-Taking Caleb in Ch11 uses periods as deliberate foreshadowing of his Taking in Ch12.
- Sister is **Lena Vale** (was originally "Mara" in early planning — all refs updated)
- Ch3 victim's wife is **Leah** (renamed from Mara to avoid overlap)
- Ch3 victim is **Joel**, case ref K-01
- Willow's face description template: "Features learned from observation rather than born to them"
- Ch1 Taking memories: kitchen at 19, yellow mug, hospital corridor, red scarf on winter beach, two girls on a staircase
- Ch1 time gap: 14:07 to 14:41
- Caleb's key line: "You don't have to optimize the answer"
- Iris's report to Kade: "Something has been removed"
- Ch5 Kade's office: second floor, repurposed building, keypad entry, layered maps on wall, boxes with site codes
- Ch5 Meridian scope: multiple sites (primary, secondary storage, offsite data mirrors), six confirmed adjacent locations in Iris's folder
- Ch5 Meridian risk management: sites spread deliberately — "From themselves"
- Ch5 Iris total time inside Meridian: three hours (34-minute gap within that)
- Ch5 Iris self-description: works "more efficiently" now — Kade notes she would have "pushed harder" before Meridian
- Ch5 Iris's closing assessment: "It's moving"
- Ch5 Terms: "Access, retrieval, no questions that get written down"
- Ch6 Rourke's dataset: hundreds of cases, classified as "behavioral flattening, dissociative presentation, emotional attenuation"
- Ch6 Neural imaging: reduced activity in specific emotional processing centers — "not uniform, targeted"
- Ch6 No cases recover fully — treatment is "management"
- Ch6 Rourke detects Iris presenting with same markers (flattened affect, delayed response, reduced emotional variance)
- Ch6 Rourke gives Iris redacted case summaries on tablet — pragmatic, not alliance
- Ch6 Iris emotional check: "Expected: frustration. Observed: none."
- Ch7 Analysis method: time-filtered gradient, directional path (not cluster), infrastructure overlay filtered to Meridian-adjacent systems
- Ch7 Transcript structure: "Question → Answer → Stop" — "Different words. Same shape."
- Ch7 Proximity sense at map: "Location: frontal. Duration: brief. Intensity: minimal."
- Ch7 Act I turn spoken aloud: "It's not a condition." "It's not environmental." "Something is moving." "And it touches people."
- Ch8 Kade's Meridian access codes still work — clearance never revoked
- Ch8 Site types: relay point (data movement), transfer point (equipment) — Kade recognized both from his logistics work
- Ch8 Kade's guilt: "I moved things through here. Crates. Equipment. Data units. Didn't ask what was in them." "Didn't ask why."
- Ch8 Proximity sense at third site: faint shift, doesn't resolve, fades — "Something" / "Nothing"
- Ch8 Iris erosion: watches Kade's pauses, notes them structurally not emotionally, recognizes the gap, does not feel the need to close it
- Ch4 revision: added recovery exchange ("To return to a previous state of function") and "Do you feel like anything is missing" / "No"
- Ch9 City flattening: fewer exchanges, interactions complete and stop, no extension, no overlap
- Ch9 Rourke's notes shifting: fewer qualifiers, shorter, more direct
- Ch9 Iris delays worsening: "duration longer than prior instances" — response to Kade's message delayed
- Ch9 Faulty decision: chose farther site over closer one, couldn't reconstruct the logic, reversed
- Ch9 Memory at intersection: image held, identity did not — can't tell if difference is the city or her
- Ch10 Iris performs throughout — not transparent about the gap, constructs appropriate responses
- Ch10 Key performances: "I still care" (clean, no hesitation), "In the ways that matter," "Showing up. Staying in contact. Maintaining—" (builds from a list)
- Ch10 "I love you" exchange: words matched, tone aligned, no delay — Lena "almost convinced. Then not."
- Ch10 Lena consulted a doctor — described Iris's behavior, told stress or dissociation
- Ch11 Caleb micro-delays: pause a fraction too long, smile stays then drops, answer lands slightly late
- Ch11 Caleb describes the site: "Nothing's broken. Everything's just… off." "Like the system's thinking about it before it does anything."
- Ch11 Iris summary: "Function intact. Continuity intact. Something else — slightly displaced."
- Ch11 Past-tense beat: "He had been the most alive person she knew. The tense registered. Past. She corrected it. He is. The correction held. Not fully."
- Ch12 Caleb's POV — only chapter from his perspective. First on-page Taking.
- Ch12 Taking memories: running as a kid, coffee on a late shift ("the warmth of it, the fact that they had noticed"), job gone wrong (improvised solution)
- Ch12 Taking mechanism: feeling separates from image, then image follows. "Gone."
- Ch12 Final memory: not an event but a state — "the sense that things mattered"
- Ch12 Post-Taking: logs "Response timing remains inconsistent. No confirmed failure." — processes event through reduced framework
- Ch12 Willow silent throughout. Hand on chest, flat, no pressure. Face not retained.
- Ch12 "Nothing in him marked the change. Nothing in him noted the absence."
- Ch13 Post-Taking Caleb: answers clean, immediate, correct — no excess, no deviation, just acceptance
- Ch13 Joke test: "I don't recall" → when prompted, "That's consistent" — not the same as the original, filled with something sufficient
- Ch13 Key test: "If everything went wrong at once" — old Caleb would improvise, this Caleb gives textbook crisis management
- Ch13 "The difference between them was not direction. Only distance."
- Ch14 Rourke scene: 63 new cases, no recoveries, says "No" faster than before. "You used to elaborate" / "The data doesn't require elaboration." Steadiness tightened, not cracked.
- Ch14 Retrieval lag: site address delayed 3-4 seconds. "Duration: longer than prior instances. Category: retrieval lag."
- Ch14 Performing grief: Kade asks "Does it bother you" — Iris says "Yes" with correct tone, no internal state. "She had not been describing a condition. She had been answering."
- Ch14 Two possibilities: dishonest, or she had forgotten to continue. Cannot determine which.
- Ch15 False certainties: phantom case (certain she marked it, no record), false site memory (interior doesn't match exterior), unrecalled conversation with Kade
- Ch15 Burned contact: flagged Iris to Kade, "said you came in wrong" — messages same but order shifted, something missing between
- Ch15 Self-note: "Do not trust sequence." Later reopens — understands words, not the conclusion. Continues without verification.
- Ch15 Map corruption: adjusts marker to fit path, coordinates don't match, leaves it
- Ch15 "Certain. Incorrect. Continuing."
- Ch16 Rebuilds map from verified record only — removes prior adjustments, path remains: one line, no branches
- Ch16 "It's one." — single moving point of contact, selectively affecting individuals
- Ch16 Iris maps her own symptoms onto the path (delay, retrieval lag, performance) — doesn't say it out loud
- Ch16 Kade: "If you're right, we're not tracking something that happened. We're tracking something that's still happening."
- Ch16 "The system had simplified. One."
- Ch16 "She was the only one who could sense it. That was not an advantage. It was a limitation."
- Ch16 "The door had closed."
- Willow reference images: `C:\Users\kriss\Dropbox\weepingwillow\` (true form + human form)
- Image style: dark gothic painterly, near-monochrome, NOT photorealism — Beksinski-adjacent
