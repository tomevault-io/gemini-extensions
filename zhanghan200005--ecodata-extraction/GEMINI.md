# EcoEvidence repository instructions

## Scope and instruction priority

This file applies to the entire repository. A more specific `AGENTS.md` or
`AGENTS.override.md` in a subdirectory may refine these rules for that subtree.

## Project mission

Build **EcoEvidence / EcoData Extraction**, a Literature-to-Data system that
turns scientific PDFs into structured, reviewable records while preserving a
traceable link from every extracted field to its source document, page, and
evidence block.

The target workflow is:

```text
literature discovery -> PDF acquisition -> text/OCR/table parsing
-> embedding and vector retrieval -> schema-guided RAG extraction
-> rule-based quality checks -> human review -> traceable export
```

The public repository must distinguish verified implementation from plans.
Never describe a capability as complete unless code, a runnable path, and
proportionate tests support the claim. Label incomplete work `Planned`,
`Prototype`, or `Experimental` in public documentation.

## Authoritative checkout

- GitHub repository: `ZhangHan200005/EcoData_Extraction`
- Owner's normal local checkout: `/Users/zhanghan/Documents/dataFetching`
- Treat the Git root as the project root. Do not create nested clones or extra
  manually managed copies inside the repository.
- Default to the normal local checkout. Do not create or remove worktrees unless
  the user explicitly requests parallel work.
- Never let two active tasks modify the same checkout at the same time. If
  parallel implementation is explicitly requested, use separate managed
  worktrees and separate branches.

## Required start-of-task routine

Before editing:

1. Run `git status -sb` and identify the current branch and upstream.
2. Read `README.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, and the files and
   tests relevant to the requested milestone.
3. Inspect existing behavior before proposing replacement code.
4. Report the verified current state, the active milestone, the intended scope,
   and measurable acceptance criteria.
5. If the worktree contains unrelated changes, preserve them and do not stage
   them. Ask only when safe separation is impossible.

## Milestone discipline

- Work on one independently verifiable milestone at a time.
- Use `docs/ROADMAP.md` as the source of truth for milestone status and scope.
- Keep changes small enough to review in one pull request where practical.
- Prefer vertical slices that leave a runnable user path over disconnected
  scaffolding.
- Do not silently expand a milestone into product redesign, paid services, or
  unrelated cleanup.
- At milestone completion, update the Roadmap, architecture documentation,
  public feature-status wording, evaluation results, and known limitations.

## Branch, commit, and PR workflow

- `main` must remain runnable, explainable, and suitable for portfolio review.
- Do not implement directly on `main`.
- Create one branch per milestone from the latest `main`.
- Do not use `codex` in branch names. Prefer:
  - `feature/<milestone>` for product work
  - `fix/<short-description>` for defects
  - `docs/<short-description>` for documentation-only work
- Use concise semantic commit messages such as
  `feat: add versioned embedding retrieval` or
  `docs: define project roadmap and agent rules`.
- Review the final diff before staging. Stage only files belonging to the
  milestone.
- Push the branch and open a Draft PR. All changes enter `main` through a PR and
  passing CI.
- Do not force-push, rewrite shared history, delete branches or data, bypass CI,
  or directly overwrite `main` without explicit user confirmation.

## Repository map

```text
app/              frontend evidence-review workbench
backend/          FastAPI, parsing, retrieval, screening, evaluation, storage
backend_tests/    backend unit and integration tests
demo/             public synthetic PDF and expected evidence
docs/             architecture, Roadmap, and learning documentation
tests/            frontend build and rendered-page tests
data/             local runtime data; database files must remain untracked
```

Keep HTTP routing in `backend/api.py`, workflow orchestration in
`backend/services.py`, data access in `backend/database.py`, and contracts in
`backend/schemas.py`. Avoid putting business logic into the frontend or API
route layer.

## Verification commands

From the repository root, run all of the following before publishing a
milestone unless the change is demonstrably documentation-only:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run test:backend
npm test
git diff --check
```

`npm test` includes a production build and rendered-page tests. When changing
retrieval, extraction, validation, or provenance behavior, add focused backend
tests and at least one end-to-end fixture assertion. Do not weaken or skip tests
to make a change pass.

For documentation-only changes, at minimum run `git diff --check`, validate all
referenced commands and paths against the repository, and confirm the working
tree contains only intended files.

## Data, secrets, and dependency safety

- Never commit API keys, tokens, `.env` files, SQLite databases, caches, logs,
  model artifacts, build output, or local absolute paths containing private
  data.
- Never commit private or copyrighted papers. Public tests and demos must use
  synthetic, openly licensed, or otherwise redistributable fixtures with their
  provenance documented.
- Keep live LLM or embedding credentials optional. Automated tests must run
  without paid API access by using deterministic fixtures, mocks, or a local
  baseline.
- Ask before adding a paid service, requiring a new secret, or making a major
  production dependency/model choice with material size, license, privacy, or
  operating-cost consequences.
- Do not report invented evaluation numbers. Every published metric must name
  the dataset or fixture, query count, metric definition, configuration, and
  retrieval/extraction version.

## Architecture and provenance contracts

- Preserve the existing lightweight retrieval baseline as a measurable control
  when adding neural embeddings or rerankers.
- Version parser, retrieval, embedding, prompt, schema, and extraction behavior
  when their outputs can change.
- Every final field must be able to reference at least:
  `document_id`, document hash, page, evidence block ID, evidence text, and
  extraction/review status. Preserve bounding boxes when available.
- Keep machine predictions distinct from human verification. Do not overwrite
  source evidence or verified labels with model output.
- Validate structured extraction against an explicit schema. Record missing,
  conflicting, excluded, and failed states instead of silently dropping them.
- Retrieval evaluation should include Hit@K, Recall@K, and MRR. Extraction and
  review evaluation should include field accuracy, evidence hit rate, human
  modification rate, and processing time when the relevant stage exists.

## Definition of done

A milestone is complete only when:

- a new user can follow the README for the affected path;
- the implemented behavior has proportionate automated tests;
- relevant provenance remains inspectable from output to source evidence;
- evaluation or acceptance evidence is recorded without exaggeration;
- lint, tests, build, and CI pass as applicable;
- the diff contains no secrets, private papers, databases, or generated cache;
- `docs/ROADMAP.md` and public status wording reflect reality;
- the branch has a clear commit and a Draft PR against `main`.

## When to pause for the user

Continue autonomously within an accepted milestone. Pause only when progress
requires one of the following:

- a product-direction choice with meaningfully different user outcomes;
- external payment, a new secret/API key, or an account authorization;
- deletion of user data or remote history;
- force push, history rewrite, branch deletion, or another high-risk Git action;
- use of private/copyright-sensitive data;
- a major dependency or model choice with unresolved license, privacy, download,
  or recurring-cost implications.

Otherwise, make the safest reasonable assumption, document it, implement the
smallest verifiable slice, and continue.
