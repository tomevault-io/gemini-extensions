# Core Patterns

- Token data managed via `useTokenData` context (centralized balance management)
- API routes follow `/api/[resource]/[action]` pattern
- All addresses lowercase in API calls and subgraph queries
- Token amounts use BigInt for contract interactions
- Timestamps use Firestore format (`_seconds`, `_nanoseconds`) for Firebase data
- Superfluid flow rates are in wei/second, convert using `flowRateToTokensPerDay()`
- Real-time animations use `useStreamingNumber` hook
- Farcaster user data fetched via Neynar API
- Safe image loading with fallback using `SafeImage` component
- StreamingBalance component shows real-time STREME balance with 4 decimals, USD value, and monthly flow rates

# Key Hooks

- `useTokenData` - Centralized token balance management
- `useWallet` - **NEW**: Unified wallet connection hook for both browser and mini-app contexts
- `useUnifiedWallet` - **NEW**: Advanced unified wallet hook with stable address management and auto-connection
- `useAppFrameLogic` - Farcaster mini-app detection and context
- `useStremeBalance` - User's STREME token balance
- `useStremeFlowRate` - User's STREME staking rewards flow rate
- `useCFAFlowRate` - User's net CFA flow rate (incoming - outgoing)
- `useStreamingNumber` - Animated number display for streaming values
- `useDistributionPool` - GDA pool management
- `useCheckin` - Daily check-in functionality (auto-claim after staking)
- `useCheckinModal` - Check-in modal state management
- `useStremeStakingContract` - STREME staking operations (deposit, withdraw, approve)
- `useBestFriendsStreaming` - Farcaster best friends integration

# Mini-App Detection

The app uses a **centralized mini-app detection system** to ensure consistent behavior across all components:

## Detection Utilities (`/src/lib/miniAppDetection.ts`)

- `detectEnvironmentForProviders()` - Early detection for ClientLayout provider selection
- `detectMiniAppWithContext()` - Enhanced detection with Farcaster context for app logic
- `detectMiniApp()` - Core detection function with wallet browser exclusion, then clientFid checks

## Detection Methods (in priority order):
1. **Wallet Browser Exclusion** - Forces desktop mode for all wallet browsers:
   - Coinbase Wallet
   - Rainbow Wallet
   - MetaMask
   - Rabby Wallet
   - Trust Wallet
   - Brave Wallet
   - Opera Crypto Browser
   - OKX Wallet
   - Zerion Wallet
   - 1inch Wallet
2. **Base App clientFid** - Checks for `clientFid === 309857`
3. **Other Farcaster clientFid** - Any other valid Farcaster client

Note: URL-based detection (checking for `/mini` path or `?miniApp=true`) is not used due to reliability concerns - these can be easily manipulated and are not consistently set across different Farcaster clients.

**Important**: All wallet browsers are explicitly excluded from mini-app mode to ensure proper wallet functionality and prevent conflicts.

## Usage Pattern:
- **ClientLayout**: Uses `detectEnvironmentForProviders()` to choose provider stack
- **useAppFrameLogic**: Uses `detectMiniAppWithContext()` with FrameProvider context
- **Consistent logging**: All detection includes method and clientFid for debugging

# Superfluid Integration

## Subgraph Queries
- Endpoint: `https://subgraph-endpoints.superfluid.dev/base-mainnet/protocol-v1`
- Key entities: `streams`, `pools`, `poolMembers`, `accountTokenSnapshots`
- Always use lowercase addresses in queries
- Token address must be embedded in query string, not as variable

## Flow Rate Calculations
- Flow rates stored as wei/second in contracts
- Convert to tokens/day: `flowRateToTokensPerDay(flowRate)`
- Convert from tokens/day: `tokensPerDayToFlowRate(tokensPerDay)`

## Common Issues
- Use `accountTokenSnapshots` for net flow rate, not individual streams
- Stream IDs format: `sender-receiver-token-userData`
- Extract receiver from stream ID if not in response

# UI Guidelines

- Use DaisyUI defaults for consistent theming
- Dark mode: use `base-100`, `base-200`, `base-300` instead of `gray-X`
- Loading states: use DaisyUI's `loading` classes
- Modals: use DaisyUI modal patterns with proper backdrop
- Forms: use DaisyUI form controls with proper validation states
- Avatars: use `SafeImage` component for user profile pictures
- Real-time values: use `font-mono` for numbers that update
- Success/error states: use DaisyUI alerts or toast notifications

# Authentication / Wallet Connection

The app uses a **unified wallet architecture** that seamlessly handles both browser and mini-app contexts:

- **Browser Mode**: Privy authentication + wagmi for blockchain operations
- **Mini-App Mode**: Direct wagmi connection with Farcaster connector only
- **Automatic Context Detection**: WagmiProvider detects environment and configures appropriate connectors
- **Wallet Override Prevention**: Browser wallets are automatically disconnected in mini-app context
- **Smart Wallet Switching**: Browser extension wallet changes are detected and synced with Privy

## Mini-App Wallet Connection Guidelines

**ALWAYS** reference the official Farcaster Mini-App documentation at https://miniapps.farcaster.xyz/llms-full.txt for wallet connection patterns.

### Key Principles:
1. **No Auto-Connection**: Never force wallet connections - the Farcaster Mini App connector will automatically connect if a user already has a wallet
2. **User-Initiated Connection**: Only connect when user explicitly clicks a connect button
3. **Standard Wagmi Pattern**: Use standard wagmi `connect()` with proper connector selection
4. **Respect User Choice**: Let users decide when to connect their wallet

### Correct Connection Pattern:
```tsx
function ConnectWallet() {
  const { isConnected, address, connect } = useWallet()

  if (isConnected) {
    return <div>Connected: {address}</div>
  }

  return <button onClick={connect}>Connect Wallet</button>
}
```

### Legacy Pattern (deprecated):
```tsx
function ConnectWallet() {
  const { isConnected, address } = useAccount()
  const { connect, connectors } = useConnect()

  const handleConnect = () => {
    const farcasterConnector = connectors.find(c => c.id === 'farcasterMiniApp')
    if (farcasterConnector) {
      connect({ connector: farcasterConnector })
    }
  }

  return <button onClick={handleConnect}>Connect Wallet</button>
}
```

### What NOT to do:
- Force auto-connection on page load
- Override user's wallet choice
- Skip the connect button for mini-app users

### useUnifiedWallet Pattern (Recommended):
```tsx
function ConnectWallet() {
  const {
    isConnected: unifiedIsConnected,
    address: unifiedAddress,
    connect: unifiedConnect,
    isEffectivelyMiniApp: unifiedIsMiniApp,
  } = useUnifiedWallet();

  if (unifiedIsConnected) {
    return <div>Connected: {unifiedAddress}</div>
  }

  return <button onClick={unifiedConnect}>Connect Wallet</button>
}
```

**Benefits of useUnifiedWallet:**
- Stable address management prevents flickering during navigation
- Automatic environment detection (mini-app vs browser)
- Built-in auto-connection logic for mini-apps
- Consistent behavior across all pages

## Provider Architecture

The app uses a **dual provider architecture** that selects the appropriate stack based on environment detection:

### Mini-App Stack:
```tsx
<FrameProvider>
  <MiniAppWagmiProvider>  // QueryClient → Wagmi (Farcaster connector only)
    <TokenDataProvider>
```

### Browser Stack:
```tsx
<PrivyProviderWrapper>
  <FrameProvider>
    <BrowserWagmiProvider>  // QueryClient → Wagmi (multiple connectors)
      <TokenDataProvider>
```

**Critical**: QueryClientProvider must wrap WagmiProvider - this is the correct order despite some documentation showing it reversed.

## Mini-App Transaction Best Practices

When implementing transactions in mini-app context (via `eth_sendTransaction`), always include:

```typescript
const txHash = await ethProvider.request({
  method: "eth_sendTransaction",
  params: [{
    to: contractAddress,
    from: userAddress,
    data: encodedData,
    chainId: "0x2105", // Base mainnet chain ID (8453 in hex) - REQUIRED
    // ... other params
  }],
});
```

**Critical**: Missing `chainId` parameter causes transactions to execute on whatever network the wallet is connected to, not Base. This affects all components that use `eth_sendTransaction` including:
- StakeButton (Now uses StakingHelper with direct send())
- UnstakeButton, SwapButton
- TopUpAllStakesButton
- StakeAllButton (Now uses StakingHelper with direct send())
- ClaimFeesButton, ZapStakeButton
- ConnectPoolButton, UnstakedTokensModal
- StakerLeaderboardEmbed

# Testing

- Jest + React Testing Library
- Test files in `__tests__/`
- Mock handlers in `__tests__/utils/`
- Run specific test: `npm test -- path/to/test`

# Key Environment Variables

- `NEYNAR_API_KEY` - Farcaster API access
- `ZEROX_API_KEY` - 0x swaps

# Documentation

- **Farcaster Mini App Docs (always updated)**: https://miniapps.farcaster.xyz/llms-full.txt

# Bash Commands

- npm run check:all: Check for all errors (do this when you're done making changes)
- npm run lint: Run the linter
- npm run typecheck: Check for type errors
- npm run build: Build the project
- npm test: Run tests
- npm run dev: Start development server

# Common Development Tasks

## Adding a New Page
1. Create page in `src/app/[page-name]/page.tsx`
2. Add navigation link if needed
3. Follow existing page patterns (loading states, error handling)
4. Use proper TypeScript types
5. Use `useUnifiedWallet` for consistent wallet connection behavior

## Adding StreamingBalance Component
The `StreamingBalance` component can be used to display real-time STREME balance:
- Shows balance with 4 decimal precision
- Displays USD value and monthly flow rate
- Only renders when user has balance or active flow rate
- Clickable to navigate to STREME token page
- Uses `useStreamingNumber` for smooth real-time animation
- Follows StakedBalance.tsx pattern for data fetching

## Working with Superfluid Streams
1. Use existing hooks (`useCFAFlowRate`, `useDistributionPool`)
2. Always handle BigInt conversions properly
3. Show real-time animations with `useStreamingNumber`
4. Include proper error handling for failed transactions

## Staking Implementation
1. **Direct Staking**: Use StakingHelper contract (0x1738e0Fed480b04968A3B7b14086EAF4fDB685A3)
   - Send SuperTokens directly using `send(recipient, amount, userData)` 
   - No approval needed - StakingHelper auto-stakes on receipt
   - Always include empty userData parameter: `"0x"`
2. **Legacy Staking**: Individual token staking contracts still exist but require approve+stake

## API Route Best Practices
1. Follow `/api/[resource]/[action]` pattern
2. Return consistent error responses
3. Validate input parameters
4. Handle missing environment variables gracefully

# Debug Mode Features

The app includes a debug menu (bottom-right corner) with:
- CFA Page - Individual streaming interface
- GDA Page - Group distribution interface
- Network switching
- Wallet connection info
- Performance metrics

Enable debug mode by clicking the floating button in development.

# Workflow

- Be sure to typecheck and lint when you're done making a series of code changes
- Prefer running single tests, and not the whole test suite, for performance
- Check balance call tracking in console during development
- Use existing patterns when adding features
- Update types in `/src/app/types/` when modifying data structures

# Important Notes

- `params` needs to be awaited in Next.js 15 (e.g., `const params = await props.params`)
- Images: Next.js warns about `<img>` tags, but they're acceptable for user avatars
- React Hook dependencies: Some are intentionally omitted to prevent re-render loops
- Superfluid queries: The subgraph sometimes returns incomplete data, always validate
- Flow rates: Can be negative (net outflow), handle UI accordingly
- Mini-app transactions: ALWAYS include `chainId: "0x2105"` in `eth_sendTransaction` calls
- CFA streams: Don't have automatic end dates - require manual termination or Flow Scheduler
- Mini-app detection: Uses `clientFid` presence as the primary detection method for reliability
- Checkin flow: Users with STREME balance must stake before claiming daily rewards (enforced in CheckinModal)
- STREME staking: Direct send to StakingHelper (0x1738e0Fed480b04968A3B7b14086EAF4fDB685A3) auto-stakes tokens

# Troubleshooting

## Network Issues
- **Transactions on wrong network**: Check `chainId` parameter in `eth_sendTransaction` calls
- **Mini-app wallet conflicts**: Fixed with new unified WagmiProvider architecture
- **Stream not starting**: Ensure all required Superfluid contract addresses are correct

## Wallet Connection Issues
- **Browser wallet not updating when switched**: Fixed with automatic sync in `useWallet` hook
- **Mini-app stuck in connection loop**: Fixed with improved disconnect logic and single detection
- **Wallet override in mini-app**: Browser wallets automatically disconnected in mini-app context
- **Debug wallet state**: Use `/debug-wallet` page to monitor all wallet states in development
- **Address flickering during navigation**: Use `useUnifiedWallet` for stable address management
- **Inconsistent auto-connection**: Use `useUnifiedWallet` pattern across all pages for consistent behavior

## Superfluid Issues  
- **Active streams not showing**: Use token address directly in query, not as variable
- **Incorrect flow rates**: Use `accountTokenSnapshots` for net rates, not individual streams
- **Missing receiver data**: Extract from stream ID format `sender-receiver-token-userData`

## Balance Issues
- **Streaming balance shows 0**: Use `balanceOf` instead of `realtimeBalanceOfNow` for actual balance
- **Animation not updating**: Check `useStreamingNumber` configuration and flow rate calculations
- **CheckinSuccessModal flow rate wrong**: Ensure STREME staking pool address matches token data (0xa040a8564c433970d7919c441104b1d25b9eaa1c)
- **StreamingBalance not showing**: Component only renders when user has STREME balance or active flow rate
- **StreamingBalance animation issues**: Follow StakedBalance.tsx pattern with proper flow rate conversion (monthly rate ÷ (86400 * 30) for per-second)

## Token Display Issues
- **Duplicate tokens in /tokens page**: 
  - Stakes are deduplicated by token address (keeps highest stake if multiple pools)
  - SuperTokens are deduplicated by token address
  - React keys use `stake-${tokenAddress}-${index}` and `supertoken-${tokenAddress}-${index}`
  - Debug logs available for STREME token to track data flow
