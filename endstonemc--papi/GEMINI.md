This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Endstone PAPI is a native C++20 PlaceholderAPI framework for
[Endstone](https://github.com/EndstoneMC/endstone) and Minecraft Bedrock Dedicated
Server. It provides a bracket placeholder parser, an owner-aware expansion registry,
and a service that resolves `{identifier:params}` placeholders through expansions
supplied by C++ or Python plugins.

PAPI is a **framework**, not a placeholder provider. The core contains **no** business
placeholders—no player name, ping, coordinates, online count, time, economy,
permissions, prefix, or similar values. Every value comes from a PlaceholderExpansion
registered by a plugin.

Architecture B is frozen: the native C++ core owns the parser, registry, service,
lifecycle, ownership, relational dispatch, and error containment. Python is a consumer,
a PlaceholderExpansion provider, and the binding/package layer. Python must never
become the PlaceholderAPI core.

## Build Commands

### Prerequisites

- CMake 3.29 or newer
- Ninja
- Conan 2
- Windows: LLVM clang-cl 20, the MSVC x64 build environment, and the Windows SDK
- Linux: Clang 20 with libc++ and libc++abi
- Python 3.10+ for the package and test tooling

The repository owns `.conan2/profiles/default` and `.conanrc`. The profile selects
RelWithDebInfo, C++20, Ninja, clang-cl on Windows, and Clang with libc++ on Linux. Do
not run `conan profile detect`, because that would replace the project profile.

### Configure and build

Run Windows commands from an x64 MSVC developer environment with LLVM's `clang-cl`
on `PATH`.

```shell
python -m pip install "conan==2.30.0"
conan install . --build=missing
cmake --preset papi-dev
cmake --build --preset papi-dev
```

The main outputs are:

- Windows: `build/RelWithDebInfo/_papi.cp314-win_amd64.pyd`
- Linux: `build/RelWithDebInfo/_papi.cpython-3xx-linux.so` (suffix varies by Python)
- Test binary: `build/RelWithDebInfo/tests/papi_test.exe` (or `.bin`)

For local Endstone development, CMake accepts
`-DFETCHCONTENT_SOURCE_DIR_ENDSTONE=<path>` to use an existing Endstone checkout.
Otherwise it fetches Endstone `v0.11.8`.

```

## Code Style

### C++ (clang-format + clang-tidy)

- Follow the repository `.clang-format` and `.clang-tidy` configuration.
- The formatting style is based on Microsoft style with Stroustrup braces.
- Naming conventions:
  - Classes, structs, and enums: `CamelCase`.
  - Methods: `camelBack`.
  - Private and protected members: `lower_case_`.
  - Local variables and parameters: `lower_case`.
  - Macros: `UPPER_CASE`.
- Formatting is mechanically enforced; do not hand-format around the formatter.
- Use C++20 with extensions disabled.
- Use `[[nodiscard]]` where ignoring a returned query or result would likely be a
  caller mistake.

### Python (ruff)

- Follow the repository Ruff configuration.
- The line length is 120 characters.
- Enabled rule families include:
  - `I` — isort.
  - `F` — pyflakes.
- Use `snake_case` for methods, functions, variables, and properties unless an
  external framework API requires otherwise.
- Preserve Endstone plugin metadata conventions where applicable.

### Comments (all languages)

- Keep comments terse and human. Default to no comment.
- For internal implementation code, when a comment is genuinely warranted, prefer
  one short line describing only a non-obvious constraint.
- Do not write multi-line explanations, rationale, design-decision narration,
  historical background, or parenthetical asides in implementation code.
- Do not leave "LLM notes": no comments explaining why a change was made, referring
  to the development, audit, or review process, or restating what the code plainly
  does.
- Do not translate obvious code into prose.
- Match the comment density and verbosity of the surrounding or original code. A
  port should remain as terse as its upstream unless a local contract genuinely
  differs.
- Comments should describe stable code constraints, not the history of how the
  implementation arrived there.

### Public API documentation

Public API documentation is a deliberate exception to the implementation-comment
brevity rule.

Project-owned public APIs should have concise documentation when callers need
information that cannot be inferred safely from the signature alone.

Document caller-visible contract only, including where relevant:

- Purpose and observable semantics.
- Parameter meaning.
- `nullptr` / `None` behavior.
- Return-value and failure semantics.
- Ownership and lifetime.
- Thread-affinity and thread-safety requirements.
- Callback or event behavior.
- Mutation and state preconditions.
- Guarantees callers may rely on.

Do not document:

- Private implementation details.
- Internal data structures.
- Historical reasons for a change.
- Review, audit, or remediation history.
- Obvious facts already expressed by the signature.

Public API documentation may use short multi-line Doxygen comments or docstrings only
when necessary to express the public contract clearly. Keep it concise; do not turn
API comments into design documents.

General rule: internal comments explain only a necessary non-obvious constraint.
Public API documentation explains only what callers may rely on.

### Include conventions

Internal headers use paths relative to `src/`:

```cpp
#include "core/parser/identifier.h"
#include "core/registry/expansion_manager.h"
#include "platform/endstone/server_platform.h"
```

Public headers use the `endstone_papi/` prefix and never include internal headers.

## Architecture

### Directory layout

```
include/endstone_papi/   # Public SDK headers (installed with the wheel)
src/
  core/                  # Framework core (no Python, no Endstone server impl)
    parser/              # Bracket scanner and identifier grammar
    registry/            # Owner-aware ExpansionManager
    service/             # Concrete PlaceholderAPI implementation
    diagnostics/         # Error throttling
    platform.h           # Abstract platform interface
  platform/
    endstone/            # Endstone-specific adapters
      bootstrap.cpp      # Service lifecycle: create, register, shut down
      server_platform.*  # Platform impl forwarding to endstone::Server
  python/                # Python bindings (depends on core, never vice versa)
    module.cpp           # pybind11 module definition
    expansion_trampoline.*  # Python-to-native expansion trampoline
    gil_safe_proxy.*     # GIL-acquiring wrapper for Python-backed expansions
tests/
  cpp/                   # Native C++ tests (GoogleTest)
  python/                # Python tests (pytest)
  test_architecture_boundaries.py
tools/
  release_changelog.py   # Deterministic changelog/release-note generation
  run_clang_tidy.py      # Static analysis runner
  test_release_changelog.py
```

### Dependency direction

```
core/parser          → (no internal deps, only public headers)
core/diagnostics     → (no internal deps)
core/registry        → core/diagnostics, core/platform.h, public headers
core/service         → core/parser, core/registry, core/diagnostics, core/platform.h
platform/endstone    → core/service, core/platform.h, Endstone API
python               → core/service, platform/endstone, Endstone API, pybind11
```

Nothing in `core/` may include Endstone server headers, Python headers, or
`platform/endstone/` headers. Nothing in `platform/endstone/` may include `python/`
headers. The dependency direction is enforced by `tests/test_architecture_boundaries.py`.

## Public API Boundaries

### C++ public types (`include/endstone_papi/`)

- `ExpansionInfo` — immutable copied metadata, safe to retain after unregister.
- `UnregisterReason` — enum: Explicit, OwnerDisabled, RequiredPluginDisabled, PapiShutdown.
- `PlaceholderExpansion` — abstract extension point for providers.
- `PlaceholderAPI` — abstract service contract, derives from `endstone::Service`.
- `ExpansionRegisteredEvent` / `ExpansionUnregisteredEvent` — metadata-only events.
- `papi::getVersion()` — build version string.

### What must not leak into public headers

- Python/pybind11 headers.
- Internal registry types (`ExpansionManager`, entries, call leases).
- Private implementation details (locks, maps, throttle state).
- Endstone server implementation headers (only `endstone::Plugin`, `endstone::Player`,
  `endstone::OfflinePlayer`, `endstone::Service` are acceptable).

### Python public surface

- `PlaceholderAPI` — native, final, non-subclassable. Loaded from the service manager.
- `PlaceholderExpansion` — subclassable. Uses pybind11 3 `py::smart_holder` and
  `py::trampoline_self_life_support`.
- `ExpansionInfo`, `UnregisterReason`, events — value/enum types.
- `_PapiBootstrap` — internal native lifecycle state owned by the PAPI plugin.

## C++/Python Interop

### Four provider/consumer paths

All four paths share one native registry:

1. C++ expansion → C++ consumer (direct native dispatch)
2. C++ expansion → Python consumer (Python loads native service)
3. Python expansion → C++ consumer (trampoline + GIL proxy)
4. Python expansion → Python consumer (full round-trip)

### Trampoline dispatch safety

The trampoline resolves overridden members by walking the Python type's MRO **above**
the pybind base class. A plain `hasattr` or `self.attr(name)` on the instance re-enters
the base binding's property or method, which dispatches back into the trampoline,
causing unbounded native↔Python recursion. This was a real incident that consumed 18 GB
of RAM in seconds. The regression is covered by tests that assert bounded behavior via a
lowered recursion limit and exact dispatch counts.

### GIL rules

- Every Python callback and every final release of a Python-backed expansion **must**
  acquire the GIL.
- Never release the GIL while holding the registry lock.
- Never let a Python exception cross into Endstone command/event/service code.
- Null C++ `OfflinePlayer*` maps to Python `None`; never dereference before binding.
- Python return values: only `None` or exact `str` are accepted. Wrong types are
  contained provider errors, never coerced with `str()`.

## Ownership and Lifecycle

### Ownership graph

```
Endstone ServiceManager --shared--> native PlaceholderApiImpl
consumer               --shared-------------^
PAPI bootstrap         --shared-------------^

PlaceholderApiImpl --owns--> ExpansionManager
ExpansionManager   --shared--> ExpansionEntry
Entry              --shared--> C++ expansion
or Entry           --shared--> GIL-safe proxy --owns-under-GIL--> Python trampoline
```

`Plugin*` is identity-only, valid while the record is active, and cleared at retirement.

### Lifecycle invariants

- Registration is atomic: validate metadata/owner/dependency/preflight first, then
  commit under a lock. A failed registration leaves no partial state.
- Owner disable removes every owned expansion before module unload. Required-plugin
  disable removes dependents even if owned elsewhere.
- PAPI's own `onDisable` drives teardown directly: transition inactive, unregister the
  named service, remove all entries, release providers, clear platform references.
- Explicit unregister marks the entry retired immediately; cleanup waits for any
  in-flight callback to return (call lease mechanism).
- A retained `shared_ptr<PlaceholderAPI>` after PAPI shutdown is permanently inert:
  `isActive()` returns false, parsing returns input unchanged, queries return empty,
  mutations fail, no method touches any plugin, server, or provider state.
- Shutdown is idempotent: calling it twice does not re-run callbacks or events.

### Cleanup ordering

- `PluginDisableEvent` fires after `onDisable`/`setEnabled(false)` but before
  task/listener cleanup and module unload. PAPI's cleanup must complete at this point.
- PAPI's own `onDisable` must not rely on receiving its own `PluginDisableEvent`,
  because its listeners may already be disabled.
- `PapiShutdown` bulk teardown suppresses unregister events because the event system
  is itself shutting down.

## Parser Semantics

### Ordinary syntax

`{identifier:params}` — first colon splits; identifier is ASCII-lowercased;
params preserve exact case/content, including underscores, dots, and later colons; no
recursion/nesting/regex.

- No colon → literal (e.g., `{player}` and `{player_name}` stay unchanged).
- Unknown/error/null → original token unchanged.
- Replacement text is never reparsed.
- Space before the separator invalidates the token (e.g., `{ player:x}`, `{play er:x}`).
- First closing brace ends the candidate; nesting is not recognized.

### Relational syntax

`{rel:identifier:params}` — processed only by `setRelationalPlaceholders`. The generic
parser first splits `rel` from `identifier:params` at the first colon; the relational
resolver then splits that remainder at the next colon. Everything after the second
colon is passed to the expansion unchanged, including underscores, dots, later colons,
case, spaces, and an empty value. Only expansions with
`supportsRelationalPlaceholders() == true` are consulted. Ordinary parsing never
invokes relational callbacks. `rel` is reserved and cannot be registered as an ordinary
expansion identifier.

### Contains semantics

`containsPlaceholders(text)` is a cheap lexical check: true when `{` has a later `}`.
Does not require a colon, valid identifier, or registration. Pure and safe from any
thread.

### Registration grammar

`[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9-]*`, canonicalized with ASCII lowercase. Reject dot,
underscore, colon, braces, percent, whitespace, and non-ASCII. `rel` is additionally
reserved by relational syntax.

## Threading

- Parsing, registration, unregister, and lifecycle transitions require
  `Server::isPrimaryThread()`. Off-thread use is a caller bug, reported once per 60
  seconds and then suppressed.
- `containsPlaceholders`, `isActive`, and copied metadata queries are thread-safe and
  may run from any thread.
- Never hold a registry lock while invoking provider code, Python/GIL work, logging,
  Endstone events, scheduler, or PluginManager calls.
- Never transparently schedule or defer; the caller's thread is the dispatch thread.

## Error Containment

- Catch `std::exception`, unknown C++ exceptions, and `py::error_already_set` at the
  provider boundary. An exception, wrong Python return type, or null/None result
  preserves the exact original placeholder.
- Log the first failure with identifier, owner, operation, and useful traceback/message.
  Suppress matching repeats for 60 seconds per entry generation and operation. On the
  next permitted message, include the suppression count.
- Error tracking is bounded and removed with the entry. Injectable monotonic clock
  enables deterministic tests.
- Do not claim to catch access violations, signals, or undefined behavior.

## Packaging

### Wheel contents

- `endstone_papi/_papi.*.pyd` (or `.so`) — native extension module
- `endstone_papi/__init__.py` — public re-exports
- `endstone_papi/plugin.py` — thin Endstone plugin bootstrap
- `endstone_papi/_papi.pyi` — type stubs
- `endstone_papi/include/endstone_papi/*.h` — public C++ headers
- `LICENSE`
- Entry point: `endstone` → `endstone_papi:PlaceholderAPIPlugin`

### Supported matrix

- CPython 3.10–3.14 (`cp310`–`cp314`)
- Windows x86-64 (`win_amd64`)
- manylinux x86-64 (`manylinux_x86_64`)

### ABI

- Tied to Endstone 0.11, C++20, target architecture, standard library, compiler runtime,
  and Python minor wheel.
- C++ providers must use a toolchain compatible with the running Endstone/PAPI build.
- Implementation/private locks/maps/pybind types must not leak into public headers.

## Release Workflow

The canonical implementation is `.github/workflows/release.yml`. Do not replace or bypass
it with manual version commits, tags, or GitHub Releases.

### Prepare `develop`

1. Finish all release changes as focused commits on `develop`.
2. Keep release notes under `## [Unreleased]` in `CHANGELOG.md`.
3. Keep the current released version unchanged in `CMakeLists.txt`.
   The wheel version in `pyproject.toml` is derived dynamically from
   `CMakeLists.txt` via the scikit-build regex metadata provider, and the
   C++ `getVersion()` is generated from `cmake/version.h.in` at configure time.
4. Run tests, build, and the self-test.
5. Ensure CI passes for the pre-release commit.

### Synchronize the pre-release commit

The non-dry-run workflow requires official `main` and `develop` to point to the same
commit. After CI passes:

1. Fetch the official refs and verify ancestry.
2. Fast-forward the pre-release commit to official `main` and `develop`.
3. Wait for official CI.

### Preview

```shell
gh workflow run release.yml --repo EndstoneMC/papi --ref main -f version=X.Y.Z -f dry_run=true
```

### Publish

```shell
gh workflow run release.yml --repo EndstoneMC/papi --ref main -f version=X.Y.Z -f dry_run=false
```

The workflow validates the version and prepares an immutable, base-keyed release-candidate
ref. It builds and runtime-validates Windows/Linux wheels and the sdist from that candidate,
then atomically advances `main`, `develop`, and the production tag only after the complete
artifact set is accepted. A retry reuses the candidate and can finish a GitHub Release after
refs were already finalized without rewriting history.

### Final synchronization

After the release workflow passes, synchronize all branches and verify that main,
develop, and the tag all point to the same commit.

## Git Conventions

- Normal development is performed on `develop`. Do not create another branch unless the
  user explicitly asks.
- Keep commits focused, independently buildable, and easy to revert.
- Never add a `Co-Authored-By` line for Claude.
- Do not force-push or rewrite published branch history.
- Unpublished local history may be rewritten when explicitly requested. Use
  `--force-with-lease` for any remote rewrite; never use an unguarded force push.
- Once a commit is covered by an official branch or a public release tag, preserve it.

## Changelog

`CHANGELOG.md` follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/):

- Add unreleased user-visible and protocol/API changes only under `## [Unreleased]`.
- Use Added, Changed, Deprecated, Removed, Fixed, Security headings.
- Write for server administrators and plugin users. Omit internal refactoring details.
- Prefix breaking changes with `**BREAKING**:`.
- The Release workflow handles section movement, dating, and comparison links.

## Clean-Room GPL Rule

Java PlaceholderAPI is GPL. Endstone PAPI is MIT. Use the frozen Java tree only to
confirm architecture, observable inputs/outputs, and edge cases. Never copy source,
comments, private control flow, or mechanically translate methods. Implement
independently from the documented specifications. When clarification is required,
study behavior and state the result in input/output/invariant terms.

## Deferred Features

The following are explicitly **not** implemented in v1 and must not be added without
architectural review:

- Core `config.toml` or `/papi reload` command
- Standalone expansion loader / jar/whl discovery
- eCloud, marketplace, or network distribution
- Business placeholder implementations in core
- Configurable recursion depth or nested placeholder parsing
- RTTI/dynamic_cast-based relational capability detection
- Public mutable registry/manager handle
- Python `PlaceholderAPI` subclassing or constructor
