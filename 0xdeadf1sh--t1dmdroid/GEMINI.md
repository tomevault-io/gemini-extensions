# T1DMDROID — local rules

## Orient before you edit

The suite's shared rules and this project's accumulated working knowledge live
one directory up, in `../T1DMCOMMON`. Read them first; nothing they hold is
restated here, and this file is only what is local and operational.

- `../T1DMCOMMON/CLAUDE.md` — the suite map, the never-a-second-copy rule, the
  branch policy this file implements, and what may never be published.
- `../T1DMCOMMON/SPEC/invariants.md` — the five-minute grid, `tz_offset`, units
  and sign conventions, **the two risk spaces**, curve semantics, the forecast
  layout, authority and ordering. Normative: where this repository's code
  disagrees with it, one of the two is a defect and neither may be assumed right.
- `../T1DMCOMMON/PROJECTS/T1DMDROID.md` — the target device, the HyperOS traps,
  the build traps, the debugging discipline, the watch link.

`docs/` is the interface documentation — `CGM.md`, `INFERENCE.md`,
`WATCH_BLE.md`, `T1DMSERVER_API.md`. Read the one your change touches, and keep
it true afterwards.

## The skills are gates, not suggestions

Read the description of each before starting, not after being blocked.

- **`publish-audit`** — before `git push`, before adding a remote, before
  creating the repository. Non-negotiable: this repository has been deleted twice
  after private content reached GitHub, and a push cannot be retracted.
- **`terse-ui-text`** — before writing or editing any string a user will see.
- **`android-device-testing`** — the build → deploy → observe loop, the `android`
  CLI, and the `dumpsys`/database patterns that verify behaviour rather than
  pixels.

## Two branches, one body of work

`main` is public and reads the sensor by passive advertisement only. `private` is
local-only and adds everything that is not merely listening: its `:cgm` sources
and their Rust counterpart, the debug bring-up surfaces they need, and the
unredacted sections of `docs/CGM.md`. Only `main` may ever be pushed;
`.git/hooks/pre-push` enforces that as an allowlist, and `publish-audit` greps for
the private symbols by name — so do not name them in a file that lives on `main`,
this one included.

**Everything outside that seam belongs on both branches** — see *T1DMDROID has
two branches, and most work belongs on both* in `../T1DMCOMMON/CLAUDE.md`.
Inference, calculators, alarms, storage, sync, the watch, the UI, the build: a
change to any of it applies to `main` as much as to `private`. Land it as its own
commit on each branch. Never merge or cherry-pick across the seam — that is
precisely how private content reached `main` the first time.

Some differences are **not** drift and must not be reconciled. Diff a file before
mirroring it if it is one of these:

- `.github/workflows/*` — the workflows fire on `push` only on `private`. On
  `main` they are `pull_request`-only, and `publish-audit` fails the push if that
  changes: a `push` trigger there made GitHub build an APK on every push.
- `LICENSE` — carried on `main`, the branch that is published.
- The `:cgm` module's architecture, and every file that plugs into it.

## Build both branches, every time

Both branches get built, every time, and the same invocation serves both:

```sh
PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH" env -u JAVA_HOME ./gradlew :app:assemblePersonalRelease
```

The prefixes are load-bearing. Without `PATH=`, `cargo-ndk` is off the path and
Gradle silently repackages a **stale** `.so` against fresh bindings; without
`env -u JAVA_HOME`, AGP picks up the too-new system JDK. Neither failure is loud.

What differs is the purpose, and therefore what you do with the result.

**`main` — proof that it still compiles.** The public branch has no connected CGM
path, so a change written against `private` can reference a class that does not
exist there, and nothing will notice until the day it is pushed. Build it, read
the result, discard the APK. Add `:app:assemblePublicRelease` when the change
touches flavour-gated code: the `public` flavour compiles a different
`Disclaimer.kt` and stubs the fail-open override out entirely
(`DeathFlavor.SUPPORTED = false`), so it is the only build exercising those paths.

**`private` — the artifact that goes on the phone.** Fully optimized: R8-minified
and resource-shrunk, the variant the user actually runs. This one gets installed.

### Bump the version when it matters

`versionCode` and `versionName` in `app/build.gradle.kts`. Bump both whenever the
build you are about to install differs from the one on the phone in anything the
user would notice — a feature, a fix, a behaviour change — so that the About
screen names what is actually running. A pure refactor that
changes nothing observable does not need one. The bump is its own commit, on both
branches: `Bump to 0.21.4 (versionCode 56).`

### Install it

Check `adb devices` first. If nothing is attached, build anyway, say the install
was skipped, and do not treat an absent phone as a failed task.

If it is attached, locate the APK with `android describe --project_dir .` rather
than guessing the path, then deploy and launch it as `android-device-testing`
describes. Worth knowing before the first install of a session: without a
`keystore.properties` the release build is signed with the **debug** key, so it
installs straight over an existing debug build rather than failing on a signature
mismatch.

The phone is the user's daily driver and this app is its CGM monitor. An install
stops the foreground service and the passive scan until the app is relaunched, so
make it the last step of a task, relaunch, and confirm the service came back
(`adb shell dumpsys activity services com.t1dm.app | grep isForeground`).

## Gates

CI runs `assemblePersonalDebug` + `assemblePublicDebug`, `cargo test --all-targets`,
`:calc:testDebugUnitTest` (the dose-calculator rail invariants — a blocking safety
gate), and `cargo test -p t1dm-core` (bit-for-bit golden vectors). Run the ones
your change touches locally; the golden vectors and the rail invariants are cheap
and catch the errors that matter most.

For the Rust core, run **both** `cargo test` and `cargo build --release`; see
*Build traps* in `../T1DMCOMMON/PROJECTS/T1DMDROID.md` for why the first alone
lets a broken release through.

## Keep `T1DMCOMMON` true

If a change here falsifies something written up there — a backend that no longer
exists, a constant now read from the descriptor, a gate that moved — update
`T1DMCOMMON` in the same task, deleting what is no longer so rather than
annotating it. If it is not yours to change, say which file and which claim is
now wrong. See *Keeping this repository true* in `../T1DMCOMMON/CLAUDE.md`.
