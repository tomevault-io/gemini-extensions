Operating rules for AI agents working in this repository (`AGENTS.md` is a symlink to this file). Process rules live here; durable knowledge in `docs/MEMORY.md`, structure in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## Build & Test Commands

The mod targets `netstandard2.1` (C# 12). Game assemblies are resolved via `ManagedPath` — auto-detected from common Steam install paths, or pass explicitly:

```powershell
# Build the mod (Debug, auto-copies to BepInEx/plugins/ if game found)
dotnet build src/BazaarPlusPlus/BazaarPlusPlus.csproj

# Build with explicit game assembly path
dotnet build src/BazaarPlusPlus/BazaarPlusPlus.csproj -p:ManagedPath="D:\Steam\steamapps\common\The Bazaar\TheBazaar_Data\Managed"

# Build both Debug + Release (Release copies to installer repo if present)
dotnet build src/BazaarPlusPlus/BazaarPlusPlus.csproj -t:BuildAll

# Run a single xUnit test project (has Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk)
dotnet test tests\Architecture.Tests\Architecture.Tests.csproj

# Run an exe-runner test project (no Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk)
dotnet run --project tests\ChoiceScreenPedestalResolver.Tests\ChoiceScreenPedestalResolver.Tests.csproj

# Format with the repo-pinned CSharpier version
./run.sh format
```

`run.sh` works on macOS and Windows (Git Bash). Subcommands:

- `./run.sh build [--with-bazaaragent] [--fast]` — Debug build (`--fast` skips NuGet restore)
- `./run.sh publish [--with-bazaaragent] [-p:Name=Value ...]` — production build: fetch remote embedded data, run seed gates, then `-t:BuildAll` (Debug + Release) with installer packaging
- `./run.sh fetch-data [-p:Name=Value ...]` — refresh remote embedded data
- `./run.sh restore-locks` — refresh committed NuGet lock files for the six published assemblies
- `./run.sh restore-locked` — validate published-assembly restores in locked mode without updating lock files
- `./run.sh test` — run all test projects under `tests/`
- `./run.sh format` — restore the repo-pinned CSharpier tool and format the source tree
- `./run.sh format-check` — restore the repo-pinned CSharpier tool and fail on unformatted files
- `./run.sh decompile [DllName]` — decompile a single game DLL (default: Assembly-CSharp)
- `./run.sh decompile-all` — decompile all tracked game DLLs
- `./run.sh decompile-ptr [DllName]` — decompile a single PTR game DLL into `decompiled-vptr/`
- `./run.sh decompile-all-ptr` — decompile all tracked PTR game DLLs
- `./run.sh snapshot-managed` — archive the installed Managed dir under `game-libs/`
- `./run.sh build-matrix` — build the source tree against every archived Managed snapshot

Test projects under `tests/` are split per-feature. Some use xUnit + `Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk` (run via `dotnet test`), others are executable (run via `dotnet run --project`). Check whether the csproj has `Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk` to determine which.

When changing a direct dependency, edit `Directory.Packages.props`, run `./run.sh restore-locks`, and review the six changed `src/**/packages.lock.json` files with the version change. Do not generate lock files for test projects. Before committing, run `./run.sh restore-locked` so dependency graph drift fails locally, then run the standard build and test commands.

## Logs & Debugging

This mod is a **BepInEx 5.x plugin** (`BepInEx.Core` 5.\*). At runtime, BepInEx writes all console output to disk at `<GameDir>\BepInEx\LogOutput.log` — the sibling of the `BepInEx\plugins\` folder the build copies into. To debug, read that file; mod log lines are structured events shaped `[BPP][<Scope>] event=<id> field=value ...` (logged via `BppLog` → BepInEx `ManualLogSource`). `Debug`-level events only emit from Debug builds; `Info`/`Warning`/`Error` always emit.

For runtime validation that needs launching the game, always launch The Bazaar through Steam (App ID 1617400) so Steam runtime state is present. On macOS: `open "steam://run/1617400"`. On Windows: `start steam://run/1617400`. Do not launch `TheBazaar.app` directly or use `run_bepinex.sh` on macOS — these bypass Steam runtime and cause subtle failures.

## Architecture

Structure lives in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`; durable knowledge in `docs/MEMORY.md` (load first); vocabulary in `CONTEXT.md`; rationale in `docs/adr/`. This section keeps only the layering rules — traps, not maps:

- Put reusable adapters over The Bazaar/Unity runtime surfaces in `GameInterop/`. Keep feature workflows, UI state, product policy, filtering/classification rules, upload decisions, and storage orchestration in `Game/`. Do not move logic into `GameInterop/` only because it mentions game enums or DTOs.
- If two features need the same runtime/prefab/static-data behavior, extract the adapter to `GameInterop/<Concept>/` and have both features consume that seam. Do not make one feature import another feature's internal implementation only to reuse a game-runtime adapter.
- Patches may target feature services through `BppPatchHost` (the static service locator; never constructor injection), but shared Harmony reflection helpers or native runtime adapters live in `GameInterop/` or `Infrastructure/`, not inside a feature directory.
- Add or extend architecture tests when establishing a new boundary that the compiler cannot enforce.

# Project Rules

- Do not edit files under `decompiled/`; treat them as read-only reference code for understanding game behavior and APIs
- When a model is serialized with MessagePack in the Unity/Mono runtime, keep the serialized DTO graph `public`
- Treat the current repo code and `decompiled/` as the source of truth; other design docs are reference and may be stale — re-review them against live code, and ground conclusions in `file:line` citations rather than prose reasoning
- For game-behavior bugs, root-cause against the decompiled game source before forming a hypothesis or writing a fix; do not trust draft specs or memory, do not ship a surface fix, and when the obvious fix fails enumerate alternative cause mechanisms instead of writing another speculative patch
- Key game entities (cards, merchants, trainers) by their stable template ID.
- When the user says a problem has failed repeatedly, stop spelunking implementation/decompiled source and first write a doc capturing background, the current problem, candidate approaches, and the verification method
- Run an independent red-team review of a large refactor/design plan before implementing, and revise from it; keep such a review strictly review-only — surface weaknesses/risks/bad assumptions with `file:line` evidence and apply no patches
- After revising a design (or receiving a review), send the revised plan back for confirmation before implementing.
- When replacing a subsystem or migrating to a prototype, remove the old implementation entirely and ship only the new version in-place — do not leave the old path as a fallback or stand up a merged build chain that runs both
- Do not build standalone probe/diagnostic scaffolding to validate a hypothesis — add a temporary probe on the main path (the user builds + reloads to verify), or drop it and record it as a to-verify item in the design doc, then ship
- When CJK text renders as tofu boxes, route the text to a CJK-capable font; do not "fix" it by editing the copy
- Touch only the named target of a delete/change request; do not opportunistically widen scope or adjust unrelated config
- Reuse the game's native UI components and the codebase's established prior-art patterns  instead of hand-rolling a new render/upload chain
- After invoking a native Unity `Button.onClick` programmatically, verify the expected game-state transition before treating the action as successful — native listeners may return silently through interaction gates such as `AllowInteraction` without throwing
- On completion, follow the settled wrap-up: review your own diff, commit, merge the working branch to `master`, push, then delete branches already merged; do not commit before reviewing or when not asked
- Format every Git commit message as Conventional Commits: `<type>(<scope>): <description>`.
- Keep commits scoped: when `./run.sh format`/csharpier reformats files outside your change.
- A long-running automation task must self-heal — auto-relaunch the game process on crash/exit and continue until the goal is met, rather than stopping on the first failure
- Never build mod file-write paths from `Application.dataPath` — on macOS its parent is the `.app` bundle root, and unsealed writes there break `codesign` re-signing and the trampoline repair (blocking `./run.sh build` after every game update). Anchor writes on `BepInEx.Paths.GameRootPath` / the `<GameRoot>/BazaarPlusPlusV4/` data dir, which BepInEx special-cases on macOS to the directory containing the `.app`

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues live in this repo's GitHub Issues (`cauyxy/bazaarplusplus-mod`), operated via the `gh` CLI. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

The five canonical triage labels are used as-is: `needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, `wontfix`. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context: vocabulary in `CONTEXT.md` at the root, decisions in `docs/adr/`. See `docs/agents/domain.md`. The full documentation map is `docs/README.md`.

Durable project knowledge lives in `docs/MEMORY.md` (load first) with detail in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (the structure/overview layer); historical working documents live only in git history. Task plans, feature requests, and bugs are GitHub issues (see Issue tracker above) — not repo docs; `docs/drafts/` is the temporary write buffer for knowledge documents only (design records, root-cause analyses, decision analyses). Consolidation promotes durable outcomes into MEMORY/ADR/ARCHITECTURE, moves actionable work to issues, and deletes the spent draft. Day-to-day edit policy: `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` and `docs/adr/` may be corrected anytime; `MEMORY.md` and `docs/README.md` are curated ONLY by consolidation runs — new knowledge goes to `drafts/`, not into them directly. Rationale lives only in `docs/adr/`; elsewhere link, don't restate. Keep `MEMORY.md` under 200 lines: merge, don't append. Boundaries: AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md = process, MEMORY.md = knowledge, ARCHITECTURE.md = structure, issues = work.

# Rules Hygiene

These rules are read by every agent session. Keep them high-signal.

## After any agentic session

If you discover a non-obvious pattern that would help future sessions, include a **"Suggested rule additions"** heading in your wrap-up summary (or the commit message) with the proposed text. Do **not** edit these rules inline during normal feature or fix work. The user decides what gets added.

## High bar for new rules

Editing or clarifying existing rules is always welcome. New rules must meet all three criteria:

1. Non-obvious — someone familiar with the codebase would still get it wrong without the rule
2. Repeatedly encountered — it came up more than once (multiple hits in one session counts)
3. Specific enough to act on — a concrete instruction, not a vague principle

Rules that apply to a single module or feature area belong in that area's own rules file, not the repo root.

## What not to put in these rules

Avoid architectural descriptions of a module or feature area. Rules should be traps to avoid, not maps to follow.

## No drive-by additions

Rules emerge from validated patterns, not one-off observations. The workflow is:

1. Agent notes a pattern during a session
2. Team validates the pattern in code review
3. A dedicated commit adds the rule with context on why it exists
