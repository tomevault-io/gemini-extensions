# Guard - AI Agent Instructions

## Project Overview

Guard is a Go CLI/TUI tool that protects files from unwanted modifications by AI coding agents. It manages Unix file permissions, ownership, and immutable flags via a `.guardfile` registry.

## Build & Run

```bash
just build          # Build binary to ./bin/guard
just install        # Install to $GOPATH/bin (DO NOT use during development — see warning below)
just test           # Format, build, install, run all tests
just ci             # Full CI pipeline with minimal output
just fmt            # Format Go code
just lint           # Run linter (golangci-lint or go vet fallback)
just clean          # Remove build artifacts
```

### Development builds

**Do NOT run `just install` during development.** It overwrites the latest stable release in `$GOPATH/bin` with the in-development build. Instead, build the binary and use it directly:

```bash
just build                  # Builds to ./bin/guard
cp bin/guard ./guard        # Copy to project root for test scripts
./guard -i                  # Run directly
tests/test-tui-search-001.sh  # Test scripts find ./guard automatically
```

Only use `just install` when you intentionally want to update the system-wide binary (e.g., after merging to main).

## Testing

### Test types
- **Go unit tests**: `go test -v ./...` (internal packages)
- **CLI integration tests**: `tests/run-cli-tests-sequential.sh` (shell-based, test real CLI behavior)
- **TUI integration tests**: `tests/run-tui-tests-parallel.sh` (tmux-based, requires `tmux` installed)

### Test conventions
- CLI tests source `tests/helpers-cli.sh` for assertions and setup
- TUI tests source `tests/helpers-tui.sh` for tmux session management and screenshots
- Test files follow the pattern `test-<category>-<number>.sh`
- TUI tests use tmux to spawn sessions, send keystrokes, capture screen output, and assert content
- Each test creates its own temp directory and cleans up after itself
- Always run `just test` or `just ci` to verify changes before claiming they work
- **Tests in `tests/` are acceptance tests — do NOT modify existing test files.** Add new test files to cover new or additional requirements instead.

### Writing tests
- CLI tests: use `assert_output_contains`, `assert_exit_code`, `assert_file_mode` etc. from `helpers-cli.sh`
- TUI tests: use `tui_start`, `tui_send_keys`, `tui_assert_screen_contains` etc. from `helpers-tui.sh`
- Keep individual TUI tests under 30 seconds (parallel runner timeout)

## Architecture

```
cmd/guard/commands/  CLI layer (Cobra) - parsing, output formatting
internal/tui/        TUI layer (Bubble Tea) - terminal UI
internal/manager/    Orchestration - business logic, sequencing
internal/filesystem/ OS operations - chmod/chown, immutable flags
internal/security/   Path validation, tamper detection
internal/registry/   Data model, YAML serialization (.guardfile)
```

### Dependency rules (strictly enforced via `internal/architecture/layers_test.go`)
- `cmd/guard/*` -> `internal/manager` only
- `internal/tui/*` -> `internal/manager` only
- `internal/manager/*` -> `internal/security` + `internal/filesystem`
- `internal/security/*` -> `internal/registry`
- **Never**: UI layers directly importing filesystem, registry, or security

### Key design principles
- Manager owns all mutation sequencing and persistence
- UI layers (CLI and TUI) are pure clients of manager - they call use-cases and render results
- The manager never prints to stdout/stderr; it returns structured results and warnings
- Registry stores relative paths; filesystem operations use absolute paths
- Platform-specific code lives in `filesystem_darwin.go` / `filesystem_linux.go`

## Git Rules

- **Never use `git -C <path>`** to operate on other worktrees. Always use the full `git` command from the current working directory.

## Code Style

- Go standard formatting (`go fmt`)
- No direct `fmt.Print*` in manager/filesystem/registry/security layers
- Errors are returned, not printed - the CLI/TUI layer decides how to present them
- Prefer typed errors for special cases (e.g., root-required operations)

## Files to never edit directly

- `.guardfile` - managed by the guard tool at runtime
- `reports/` - generated test artifacts (gitignored)

## Common workflows

### Adding a new CLI command
1. Create `cmd/guard/commands/<command>.go` with Cobra command definition
2. Add corresponding manager method in `internal/manager/`
3. Write shell test in `tests/test-<command>-001.sh`
4. Run `just test` to verify

### Adding a TUI feature
1. Modify relevant files in `internal/tui/` (Bubble Tea Model/Update/View)
2. If new data is needed, add a manager query method - do not access filesystem or registry directly
3. Write tmux-based test in `tests/test-tui-<feature>-001.sh`
4. Run `just test` to verify

### Fixing a bug
1. Write a failing test first (`tests/test-bug-<area>-<number>.sh`)
2. Verify it fails with `just test`
3. Implement the fix
4. Verify it passes with `just test`

## Ticket Management

Every feature request or bug fix must have a corresponding test ticket that blocks it. The test ticket describes how to write a failing test that confirms the feature is not yet implemented or the bug still exists. The implementation ticket depends on the test ticket — no implementation work begins until the failing test is written and verified.

### Workflow
1. Create a test ticket: "Write acceptance tests for: \<feature/bug summary\>"
2. Create the implementation ticket: "\<feature/bug summary\>"
3. Ensure the test ticket is closed before implementation begins (implementation is blocked by test)
4. Write the failing test first, verify it fails
5. Close the test ticket
6. Implement the feature/fix, verify the test passes
7. Close the implementation ticket

### Rules
- **No implementation without a failing test** — every implementation ticket must be blocked by a test ticket
- **Tests must fail first** — a test ticket is only closed once the test exists and fails against current code
- **Test describes the "what", not the "how"** — test tickets describe observable behavior to assert, not implementation details

## Session Completion

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds
