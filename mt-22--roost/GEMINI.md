# AGENTS.md — Roost

## Project Overview

**Roost** is a terminal-based dotfile manager written in Rust. It moves application config files into a central `~/.roost/` directory organized by device-specific **profiles**, creates **symlinks** back to original locations, and uses git for cross-device sync.

- **Version:** 0.2.0
- **Edition:** Rust 2024, MSRV 1.85+
- **Binary:** Single binary, no runtime assets (data embedded via `include_str!`)
- **No async** — blocking I/O, suspend TUI for external tools

### Data Models

**`SharedAppConfig`** (`roost.toml`, git-tracked):
- `remote: Option<String>`
- `profiles: BTreeMap<String, Profile>`
- `apps: BTreeMap<String, Application>`
- `ignored: BTreeSet<String>`

**`LocalAppConfig`** (`local.toml`, git-ignored):
- `active_profile: String`
- `os_info: OsInfo`
- `link_paths: BTreeMap<String, PathBuf>`

**`Application`**:
- `primary_config: Option<PathBuf>`
- `on_profiles: BTreeSet<String>`
- `is_dir: bool`
- `ignore: Vec<String>`

**`Profile`**:
- `apps: BTreeSet<String>`
- `app_sources: BTreeMap<String, String>` (app -> source_profile for cross-profile symlinks)

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Two-config split:** `roost.toml` shared via git, `local.toml` per-device gitignored.
2. **Same backend for CLI and TUI:** All logic in `app/`, `linker/`, `scanner/`, `git/`. Both interfaces must call the same domain operations; duplication is a bug. See [R-9].
3. **Cross-platform symlinks:** `#[cfg]` branches for Unix/Windows. Cross-platform claims require passing platform-specific tests; see [R-11].
4. **Suspend/resume for external tools:** TUI must drop to regular terminal for `$EDITOR`, `$PAGER`, `git`.
5. **Auto-commit batching:** State mutations set `pending_auto_commit`, processed after event loop.
6. **Atomic writes:** Config files are written to a unique temp file then renamed for concurrency safety.
7. **Path validation:** `validate_path_in_home()` prevents ingest of paths outside `~` or containing `..`. This is mandatory at all mutation boundaries; see [R-1] and [R-2].

## Build & Test

```bash
# Full test suite
cargo test

# Release build
cargo build --release

# Environment override
ROOST_DIR=/tmp/test-roost cargo run -- init
```

**Dev dependencies:** `assert_cmd`, `predicates`, `tempfile`
**Runtime external:** `git` CLI, `$EDITOR` (default `vi`), `$PAGER` (default `less`)

**Test targets:** ~184 tests total (~112 unit + ~71 integration + 1 doctest). All CLI commands have integration test coverage except init. Rollback and sync tests included.

---

## UI Style (Preserve Verbatim)

- **Color palette:** Cyan (focused borders), Yellow (key labels, dialog borders), DarkGray (unfocused, hints), Red (destructive confirms), Green (affirmative, active profile), White (bold highlights)
- **Highlight:** `bg(DarkGray) + bold` for cursor
- **Status bar:** Yellow keys, e.g. `j/k nav  Tab focus  / search  ...`
- **Miller columns:** Responsive: 3 equal thirds >=100w, 2-col >=55w, vertical stack < 55w
- **Symbols:** `*` primary, `>>` cursor, `<-` sourced, `check` selected, `bullet` bullet
- **Dialog overlays:** Centered, bordered block with `Clear` widget behind

### Key Bindings (Complete Map)

**Base:** `j/k` nav, `Tab` focus, `h/l` miller, `/` search, `?` help, `q` quit
**Apps panel:** `o` open primary, `x` remove, `f` import-from, `m` paste-into
**Files panel:** `e/Enter` edit, `p` set primary
**Actions:** `s` save, `S` sync, `a` add app, `i` ignore, `P` profile, `g` git log, `d` diff, `u` undo
**Dialogs:** `y/n` confirm, `Tab` cycle modes, `Esc` cancel, `j/k` navigate, typing for search

## Coding Conventions

- **Error handling:** Use `color_eyre::Result` and `eyre::bail!` for errors.
- **Collections:** Prefer `BTreeMap`/`BTreeSet` over `HashMap`/`HashSet` for deterministic ordering.
- **Tests:** Unit tests co-located in `src/*/tests.rs`. Integration tests in `tests/*.rs` using `assert_cmd` subprocess pattern.
- **UI:** Follow the SPEC palette and symbols exactly. No deviation without user approval.
- **Architecture:** Elm-style for TUI: `State` + `handle_event(&mut State, KeyEvent) -> Action` + `render(&mut State, Frame)`. No retained widgets.
- **No async:** Blocking I/O throughout.
- **No secrets in git:** `local.toml` is gitignored by design.

## Engineering Principles

These principles guide all design and implementation decisions. They are aspirational values that shape how we build; the Enforceable Rules below make specific requirements mandatory.

1. **Safety over convenience.** Every filesystem mutation is conservative, validated, and reversible. We prefer failing loudly to silently corrupting user data.
2. **One source of truth for business logic.** CLI and TUI must call the same domain-level operations. Duplication between interfaces is a reliability bug, not a cleanliness issue.
3. **Fail loud, never silent.** Suppressed errors (`let _ = ...`) on filesystem or config operations are treated as state-corruption hazards. Every ignored result must be justified.
4. **Product claims must match implementation exactly.** No feature is documented or exposed in the UI until it is fully implemented and tested. Over-promising destroys trust.
5. **Path safety is non-negotiable.** All paths used in mutations must be validated before use. This applies to user-provided paths, config-derived paths, and dynamically constructed paths alike.
6. **Backup fidelity: preserve type and shape.** Backups must replicate file, directory, and symlink structure faithfully. Following symlinks during backup destroys reversibility.
7. **Config-filesystem coherence.** Never commit when config state and filesystem state disagree. A commit that claims success while symlinks are wrong is worse than no commit.

## Enforceable Rules

These rules are binding constraints on all code changes. Violations must be fixed before merge.

### Path Safety
- **[R-1]** All mutation entry points (`ingest`, `restore`, `unlink`, `ensure_links`, `switch_profile`) MUST validate their origin path via `validate_path_in_home()` (or an equivalent hardened validator) before touching the filesystem.
- **[R-2]** Profile names and app names MUST be sanitized before use in `profile_dir()` or `app_dest()`. Names that contain path separators, parent-dir references, or null bytes MUST be rejected at config creation time.

### Backup & Conflict Handling
- **[R-3]** Backup logic MUST distinguish file, directory, and symlink. Use type-specific helpers; never assume a path is a directory.
- **[R-4]** Backups MUST preserve symlinks as symlinks, not copy their targets. Do not use `copy_dir_recursive` on paths that may contain symlinks.
- **[R-5]** Removal MUST match the type being removed: `remove_file` for files/symlinks, `remove_dir_all` for directories. Type-blind removal is forbidden.

### Error Handling
- **[R-6]** `let _ = ...` on filesystem or config operations is FORBIDDEN unless accompanied by a comment justifying why the error is safe to ignore. Prefer `if let Err(e) = ...` with explicit logging or propagation.
- **[R-7]** Repair and rollback operations MUST fail hard on critical relinking failure. Warnings are acceptable only for non-critical cleanup (e.g., empty directory removal). Never commit after a critical repair failure.

### UI/UX Consistency
- **[R-8]** Unimplemented TUI features MUST be hidden or clearly marked unavailable. No placeholder status messages like "not yet implemented."
- **[R-9]** CLI and TUI MUST share the same mutation layer. New domain operations (`add_app`, `remove_app`, `create_profile`, `delete_profile`, `rename_profile`, `switch_profile`) live in `src/ops.rs`. `main.rs` and `tui/` are thin input/output adapters only.

### Documentation Honesty
- **[R-10]** Every README claim MUST be verified against actual CLI/TUI behavior before release. Documentation that describes stronger behavior than implemented is a bug.
- **[R-11]** Cross-platform claims require platform-specific tests. Do not claim Windows support unless all symlink creation, removal, and scanner paths are verified on Windows.

### Testing
- **[R-12]** New filesystem mutation paths MUST include invariant tests: path rejection, backup fidelity (file/dir/symlink), and failure-path assertions that verify no partial success is reported.

## Dependency Notes

Already in `Cargo.toml`:
- `ratatui = "0.30"`, `crossterm = "0.29"`, `color-eyre = "0.6"`, `dialoguer = "0.12"`, `dirs = "6"`, `serde = "1"`, `toml = "0.8"`, `clap = "4"`, `time = "0.3"`
- `clap_complete = "4"`, `ctrlc = "3"`

---

## Environment Notes

- `ROOST_DIR` env var overrides the default `~/.roost` directory.
- Integration tests use `tempfile` to create isolated roost directories.
