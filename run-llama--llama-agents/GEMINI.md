# LlamaIndex Workflows - Claude Development Guide

## Project Overview
This is the LlamaIndex Workflows library - an event-driven, async-first framework for orchestrating complex AI applications and multi-step processes.

## Key Technologies
- Python 3.9+
- AsyncIO (async/await)
- Pydantic for data models
- Starlette for web server
- Uvicorn for ASGI serving

## Setup
- Install uv: `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`
- Install deps (dev): `uv sync --all-packages --all-extras`

## Development Commands

### Testing

Use the `dev` CLI to run tests:

```bash
# Run all package tests
uv run dev

# Filter by substring match
uv run dev -p workflows
uv run dev -p server -p client

# Pass pytest args after --
uv run dev -- -k test_name
```

For more advanced scenarios, you can always `cd packages/some-package` and use pytest directly. The dev tool just provides additional package level test parallelism, and more curated cross package test output to avoid context bloat.

Several packages have Docker integration tests (requires Docker running) marked with `@pytest.mark.docker`. Run them with:

```bash
cd packages/<package> && uv run pytest -m docker -s -n0
```


### Linting & Formatting
```bash
uv run pre-commit run -a
```

If type checkers (ty, basedpyright) fail with unresolved imports, you likely need all packages installed: `uv sync --all-packages --all-extras`

## Architecture

See `architecture-docs/` for high-level architectural overviews:
- [`core-overview.md`](architecture-docs/core-overview.md) — Workflow, Context, Runtime, and event flow
- [`control-loop.md`](architecture-docs/control-loop.md) — The reducer-based execution engine
- [`server-architecture.md`](architecture-docs/server-architecture.md) — HTTP server, persistence, and runtime decorators
- [`overall-architecture.md`](architecture-docs/overall-architecture.md) — Cloud platform architecture (operator, control plane, appserver)
- [`build-api.md`](architecture-docs/build-api.md) — Build API for deployment creation
- [`quick-reference.md`](architecture-docs/quick-reference.md) — Code navigation guide and key constants

The DBOS package has its own architecture doc explaining the distributed model (process boundaries, adapter rules, idle release):
- [`packages/llama-agents-dbos/ARCHITECTURE.md`](packages/llama-agents-dbos/ARCHITECTURE.md)

## Key Components
- **Workflow** - Main orchestration class
- **Context** - State management across workflow steps
- **Events** - Event-driven communication between steps
- **WorkflowServer** - HTTP server for serving workflows as web services

## Versioning with Changesets

```bash
npx changeset              # Add a changeset
npx changeset status       # Check pending changes
```

Changeset descriptions should be a single line in plain English. Keep it short and simple. Do not use conventional-commit prefixes (no `fix(scope):`, `feat(scope):`, etc.).

## Development Environment

```bash
uv run operator/dev.py up             # Set up kind cluster and start development
uv run operator/dev.py down           # Clean up deployed resources
uv run operator/dev.py down --delete  # Delete the kind cluster
uv run operator/dev.py status         # Show cluster status
```

## Other Components

For Operator/Helm details, see `operator/AGENTS.md` and `charts/AGENTS.md`.

## Notes for Claude
- Always run tests after making changes: `uv run dev`
- Never use classes for tests, only use pytest functions
- Always annotate with types function arguments and return values
- The project uses async/await extensively
- Context serialization requires specific JSON format for globals

## Autonomous Operation

The following rules apply if you are running in an isolated sandbox environment and have tools to commit and push changes to git

Make sure to install uv as the package manager. Development commands rely on it.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Always run tests and pre-commit before committing:

```bash
uv run dev
uv run pre-commit run -a
```

## Testing Patterns

We use **pytest** with idiomatic pytest patterns. Follow these guidelines:

- **No Test Classes**: Do not use test classes to organize tests. Write tests as standalone functions. Achieve organization through descriptive function names (e.g., `test_create_job_with_invalid_input_raises_error`) or by splitting into separate test files.
- **Pytest Fixtures**: Use fixtures for setup/teardown and shared test dependencies. Prefer fixtures over manual setup code repeated across tests.
- **Prefer Real Objects Over Mocks**: Use simple dataclasses and real objects directly when available rather than mocking them. Only mock external dependencies or things that are truly difficult to instantiate.
- **DRY Test Setup**: Do not repeat patches or setup code. Create reusable abstractions—fixtures, helper functions, or module-level constants—that can be shared across tests. Tests can easily be overwhelmed with setup; start from a rich suite of testing utilities to enable many small, expressive tests.
- **Simple Testing Utilities**: Testing utilities should be basic—just functions, fixtures, and global variables. Avoid over-engineering test infrastructure.

## Coding Style

- Always use `from __future__ import annotations` at the top of each test file. Never use string annotations.
- Include the standard SPDX license header at the top of each file:
  ```python
  # SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
  # Copyright (c) 2026 LlamaIndex Inc.
  ```
- Comments are useful, but avoid fluff.
- Import etiquette
  - **Do not use inline imports.** This is the default rule. Do not move imports into functions just to make an edit work quickly, avoid a top-level import conflict, or silence a linter/type checker.
  - Inline imports are allowed only for two accepted conditions: circular import chokepoints and known startup-time deferrals.
  - Circular import deferrals must have a well-defined chokepoint that owns the inline import burden. Prefer the high-level orchestration module that closes the loop, such as `workflow.py`; keep low-level leaf modules on normal top-level imports.
  - Startup-time deferrals are only acceptable for known, measured import costs on latency-sensitive surfaces, such as fast CLI startup. Do not invent new startup deferrals casually.
  - If a change appears to need a new inline import, first look for a normal top-level import, a better module boundary, or an existing chokepoint. Treat adding an inline import as a design exception, not a convenience.
  - When an inline import is truly warranted, it must carry a short comment explaining the deferral reason: which cycle it breaks, or what startup cost it avoids. No naked inline imports.
  - Put inline imports at the very beginning of the function that uses them, before other executable logic.
  - `if TYPE_CHECKING` imports may only be used alongside one of the accepted inline-import patterns above, so the runtime import stays deferred while annotations remain typed.
  - Do not wrap deferred-only types in string annotations. Use `from __future__ import annotations` instead.
- Only add `__init__.py` `__all__` exports when a file is legitimately needed for public library consumption. Module level imports should not be used internally. For the most part you should never do this unless explicitly requested to do so
