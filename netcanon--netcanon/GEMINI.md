# Netcanon — Contributor Directives

These directives govern all development in this repository.  Follow them in
every session without being asked.

**Project orientation:** if this is your first read, also skim
[`README.md`](README.md) for the quickstart and
[`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) for the 4-layer design.
[`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) is the authoritative current-state
shipping log; [`translator-plans.txt`](translator-plans.txt) is the
slower-changing architectural sketch (most R / GAP / Phase items
now `[SHIPPED]`).  [`tests/fixtures/real/RESULTS.md`](tests/fixtures/real/RESULTS.md)
tracks per-codec certification state.

## Two concerns, one FastAPI app

Netcanon handles two independent (but co-hosted) concerns:

1. **Backup** — `netcanon/collectors/` + `netcanon/api/routes/backups.py`.
   Pulls raw `running-config` (or vendor equivalent) from devices over
   SSH / NETCONF / REST and stores in `configs/<host>.<ext>`.  Mocked in
   tests at a single entry point: `get_collector`.
2. **Migration** — `netcanon/migration/`.  Translates a stored backup
   from one vendor's native config to another through a shared
   `CanonicalIntent` tree.  Per-vendor codecs under
   `netcanon/migration/codecs/` — see
   [`netcanon/migration/codecs/README.md`](netcanon/migration/codecs/README.md)
   for authorship guide.

A change to one concern rarely touches the other.  When in doubt about
where code belongs, ask: "does this fetch bytes off a device?" → backup.
"Does this translate canonical representation?" → migration.

---

## Parallel Platform Development

Netcanon ships on two platforms.  Both must always be kept at feature parity.

| Platform | Package | Entry point |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| Web (browser) | `netcanon/` | `uvicorn netcanon.main:app` |
| Desktop (Windows) | `netcanon_desktop/` | `python -m netcanon_desktop` |

**Distribution variants — NOT separate platforms.**  Docker
(`ghcr.io/netcanon/netcanon` GHCR primary + `docker.io/netcanon/netcanon`
Docker Hub mirror), `pip install netcanon`, and the Windows MSI are
all distribution methods, not platforms.  Docker and pip both produce
a **web-platform** install (the container's entrypoint is
`uvicorn netcanon.main:app` — same code path as host-installed web);
the MSI produces a **desktop-platform** install.  None of them require
their own parity test row; a feature that lands on the web platform
automatically reaches Docker + pip users on the next release tag.
The doc-sync table below has a "packaging / distribution workflow
changes" row covering edits to `Dockerfile`, the publish workflows,
and the supply-chain attestation surfaces.

**Rule:** whenever a functional feature is added or changed on one platform, the
equivalent must be implemented on the other platform in the same commit (or the
same branch, if it spans multiple commits).  Never leave one platform behind.

This applies to:
- New API endpoints
- New UI pages or views
- New device definition schema fields
- New collector strategies
- New storage backends
- New application settings that affect behaviour

---

## Platform-Specific Exceptions

The following are intentionally platform-specific and do **not** require
cross-platform equivalents:

**Desktop only**
- System tray icon (Show / Preferences… / Open configs folder / Quit menu)
- MSI installer, Start Menu shortcut, taskbar pinning
- Embedded WebView window management (hide-to-tray on close, restore on show)
- Native window chrome (title bar, window icon via `.ico`)
- `setup_desktop.py` build script and `netcanon_desktop/` package
- **Open in text editor** (`config-open-btn`, `POST /api/v1/configs/{filename}/open`) —
  calls `os.startfile()` on the local filesystem.  Only meaningful when the server runs
  on the same machine as the user.  Enabled via `Settings.open_in_editor = True` in
  `netcanon_desktop/settings.py`.  The web platform equivalent is the existing
  **View** button (`config-view-link`) which renders the file in the browser.
- **Preferences dialog** (`netcanon_desktop/preferences_dialog.py`) — operator-
  configurable paths (configs / definitions / data dir), embedded-server port,
  and toggles.  Persisted to `%APPDATA%\Netcanon\preferences.json`.  Equivalent
  to the web platform's `NETCANON_*` env-var / `.env` configuration surface;
  desktop operators have no shell-level knob, so the dialog is the equivalent
  affordance.  PySide6 widgets carry `setObjectName()` IDs following the
  `pref-dialog-<field>-<action>` convention (the desktop equivalent of
  `data-testid` since Qt has no native test-id attribute).
- **Single-instance enforcement** (`netcanon_desktop/single_instance.py`) —
  Windows named mutex (`Global\NetcanonSingleInstance_v1`) refuses to launch a
  second copy.  Without this guard the duplicate process fails to bind the
  embedded server's TCP port and surfaces as a confusing fatal-error MessageBox;
  the friendly "already running" hint is much more discoverable.  No-op on
  non-Windows platforms.

**Web only**
- Interactive Swagger API docs at `/docs` — the web browser opens this freely;
  it is accessible from the desktop too but not surfaced in the desktop UI
- `--host` / `--port` flags for public network binding — the desktop always
  binds on `127.0.0.1` with a fixed internal port and is never exposed on LAN

**Deliberately omitted (preventive)**

The following are explicitly OUT OF SCOPE for the desktop platform.  They
are listed here so a future contributor doesn't add them speculatively
without an explicit product decision to reverse the call:

- **Telemetry / usage analytics** — no phone-home, no opt-in tracking.
  The desktop is a single-user local utility; analytics would add no
  product value and would surprise privacy-conscious operators.
- **Auto-update** — updates are delivered via fresh MSI download +
  reinstall.  Auto-update would require a code-signing infrastructure
  and persistent background scheduler we deliberately don't ship.
- **File associations** — no `.cfg` → Netcanon handler.  Operators
  open files via the in-app **View** / **Open in editor** affordances
  rather than from File Explorer.
- **Crash reporting** — fatal errors surface via MessageBoxW and the
  log file under `%APPDATA%\Netcanon\netcanon.log`; users can attach
  the log to a bug report.  No automatic crash uploads.

## Feature Parity Checklist

When adding a feature, verify all of the following before committing:

- [ ] `netcanon/` — new route, service logic, or model implemented
- [ ] `netcanon/templates/` — new template has `data-testid` on every
      interactive element (buttons, inputs, links, table rows)
- [ ] `netcanon_desktop/` — any new server behaviour is exercised through
      the embedded server (pure UI pages require no extra desktop work)
- [ ] `tests/unit/` — pure-function tests cover new logic
- [ ] `tests/integration/` — API-level tests cover new endpoints
- [ ] `tests/e2e/` — Playwright tests cover new UI flows (web platform)
- [ ] `tests/desktop/` — new server or app behaviour mocked and tested

---

## Documentation Sync Checklist

Code and docs drift silently — the only reliable defence is to treat
docs as part of the definition of "done".  When you change something,
update its documentation in the SAME commit, not a follow-up.  The
mapping below is concrete; audit every applicable row before you run
`git commit`.

| If you change / add … | Then touch … |
|---|---|
| A new interactive HTML element (button, input, link, row, `<select>`, `<option>` inside a form) | `tests/testid_reference.md` — document the new `data-testid` in the appropriate page section.  **Self-check:** run `grep -r 'data-testid="<new-id>"' tests/testid_reference.md` before committing; if it returns nothing, you haven't done the update. |
| A new Jinja partial (`templates/_partials/<name>.js`) | The file-level comment block in the parent template (e.g. `migrate.html`'s "Contents map" comment) **and** the "Template organisation" section of `ARCHITECTURE.md` if the partial introduces a new pattern |
| A new file under `netcanon/templates/` with a non-`.html` extension OR in a new subdirectory not covered by the existing globs | `pyproject.toml` `[tool.setuptools.package-data]` — extend the `netcanon = [...]` list with a glob covering the new pattern (e.g. `templates/_partials/*.js`, `templates/_components/*.svg`).  Editable installs (`pip install -e`) hide this because they import from the source tree directly; production wheels do not.  Missing template files in the wheel result in `jinja2.exceptions.TemplateNotFound` 500-on-render at runtime — the bug that broke v0.1.0-rc1 / rc2.  The CI `docker-build-smoke` job catches dashboard-rendering regressions of this class but only for the dashboard page; if your new pattern only affects a different page, also add a smoke-test step that visits that page. |
| A new codec under `netcanon/migration/codecs/<vendor>/` | `netcanon/migration/codecs/README.md` — update the "Shape of a codec" codec count + wire-format table; add the vendor to `ARCHITECTURE.md` if it's a new wire-format class |
| A new module inside an existing codec (e.g. `port_names.py`, `vlan_heuristics.py`, `_svi_absorption.py`) | `netcanon/migration/codecs/README.md` "Module layout" section if the pattern is worth propagating to other codecs |
| A new target-profile YAML under `netcanon/definitions/library/target_profiles/` | Per-profile unit test in `tests/unit/migration/test_target_profile_shipped.py` asserting exact port-name list + count (regression guard against copy-paste mistakes) |
| A target-profile gains `modules:` (migrates to module-variant shape) | Add its `{vendor}/{model}` key to the canonical allowlist at `tests/fixtures/module_variants.py`.  Both the unit-tier and integration-tier tests import from there; a CI-guard (`test_module_variant_allowlist_shared_with_integration_tier`) enforces the single-source invariant so no manual sync is required. |
| A new canonical field on `CanonicalIntent` / `CanonicalInterface` / etc. | `docs/adding-a-canonical-field.md` — the MTU wire-through is the reference worked example |
| A new route, endpoint, or public function in a module whose top-of-file docstring enumerates contents (e.g. `netcanon/api/routes/migration.py`, `netcanon/services/migration_pipeline.py`) | The module docstring itself — if it lists endpoints / phases / public surface, your addition changes that list.  "Phase 2 *will* add …" comments become lies the instant Phase 2 lands.  Module docstrings that describe *intent* rather than *inventory* are unaffected. |
| A new hard rule / cross-cutting invariant surfaced by a bug | This file (`AGENTS.md`) — add to the "Hard Rules (Never Break)" section with a one-line rationale pointing at the failure mode |
| A codec is promoted to `best_effort` or `certified` | `tests/fixtures/real/RESULTS.md` — update the coverage matrix and certification decision; ARCHITECTURE.md's cert paragraph intentionally defers to RESULTS.md as source of truth |
| A new real-capture fixture under `tests/fixtures/real/<vendor>/` | (1) `tests/fixtures/real/NOTICE.md` — provenance + attribution row; (2) `tests/fixtures/real/RESULTS.md` — per-codec coverage matrix row + Summary table count refresh; (3) `tests/fixtures/real/WANTED.md` — "Current corpus snapshot" count if the new fixture changes it; (4) `docs/vendors/<vendor>.md` — fixtures-section enumeration (if the new fixture exercises a notable grammar surface — e.g. a new VRRP form, a new EVPN type, the first MSI-build example).  The 2026-05-21 docs-audit caught 5 fixtures landed in NOTICE/RESULTS without propagating to vendor pages, surfacing this gap; this row was extended to close it. |
| A new pytest marker in `pyproject.toml` (`[tool.pytest.ini_options] markers = [...]`) or a new conftest fixture that meaningfully changes how a whole test tier runs | `tests/README.md` — the markers table and/or the "How to run" section.  Markers without doc entries are invisible to contributors running `pytest -m <name>`. |
| A file-tree listing or "contents map" in any doc (`ARCHITECTURE.md` partial inventories, `definitions.html` header comment, sub-README directory trees) | Either update the listing in the same commit as the new file, OR convert the listing to a pointer ("see `netcanon/templates/_partials/` for the current set").  Exhaustive inventories that enumerate every file become a maintenance tax — prefer one-line pointers unless the enumeration carries load-bearing explanation. |
| A fourth or subsequent commit shipping pieces of the *same* new conceptual subsystem (e.g. target profiles, module variants, per-pane overrides, cross-mesh validation) | `ARCHITECTURE.md` — at the Nth commit of a thematic series, ask: "does the architecture doc have a section describing this concept, or only the piecemeal mechanics?"  If the concept is absent, add a short section in that same commit.  N is a judgement call but 3-5 commits is the rough threshold. |
| A function gains a new parameter or changes return shape | Its docstring (Google-style sections for Args / Returns / Raises) |
| A pipeline-stage signature (anywhere in `migration_pipeline.py`) | **DON'T.**  These are frozen (see Hard Rules).  Add a NEW function instead; the module docstring tracks which are frozen |
| The module-variant schema gets a new field on `TargetProfile` / `TargetModule` | The class docstring in `netcanon/migration/target_profiles.py` — it includes a worked YAML example that must stay accurate |
| In-file references like "see commit abc1234" in a partial or module comment | Fine to include for load-bearing rationale; don't rely on them for discoverability — put the same info in a nearby README if other contributors need it |
| A new CSS colour added to `base.html` (or any template's `<style>` block) | Use `var(--token)` referencing the theme-token set at the top of `base.html`'s `<style>` block.  Add a new token to BOTH the `:root` (light) and `[data-theme="dark"]` (dark) blocks if no existing token fits — a new raw hex that only works in light mode WILL look wrong in dark mode.  See ARCHITECTURE.md "Theming (dark mode)" for the three load-bearing rules |
| A capability-matrix change on a codec (xpath flips between supported / lossy / unsupported) | The matching expectation YAML under `tests/fixtures/cross_vendor_expectations/` for every pair the codec participates in, AND a regen commit for `CROSS_MESH_RESULTS.md` + `PHASE4_RECONCILIATION.md` + `latest.json` (run `python tools/run_full_mesh.py --matrix` followed by `python tools/run_phase4_reconciliation.py --write-baseline` — the `--write-baseline` flag is REQUIRED to overwrite the committed `latest.json` + `PHASE4_RECONCILIATION.md`; a bare run writes only the gitignored timestamped archive so inspecting drift never silently moves the ratchet) |
| A user-facing feature ships or changes (new codec, capability-matrix delta, sanitization rule, CLI subcommand, HTTP endpoint, supported-vendor list change, UI behaviour change) | The operator-facing docs that describe it: per-vendor page under [`docs/vendors/<vendor>.md`](docs/vendors/) (if vendor-specific), [`docs/CAPABILITIES.md`](docs/CAPABILITIES.md) (if capability-matrix delta), [`BUG_REPORTING.md`](BUG_REPORTING.md) (if the sanitiser / submission flow changes), [`docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) (if a new failure mode), [`docs/HOW_WE_TEST.md`](docs/HOW_WE_TEST.md) (if a new test layer or audit category).  Operator-facing prose drifts faster than code; "the docs lied to me" is the failure mode this row prevents and the matrix-honesty discipline depends on |
| A new variance class added to `tools/run_phase4_reconciliation.py` | `ARCHITECTURE.md` "Cross-mesh fidelity audit harness" subsection — the bullet list of variance classes is exhaustive, not illustrative; missing entries become drift |
| A new backup-side device definition under `netcanon/definitions/library/<vendor>/<os>/<ver>.yaml` | Per-vendor unit definition test under `tests/unit/definitions/`, per-vendor integration test, per-vendor desktop test (each pinning schema, probe regexes, codec round-trip).  See BD-Aruba (`7b3d7ed`) / BD-Junos (`271f196`) / BD-Arista (`a5441b9`) for the established three-test recipe |
| Render-side codec changes touching field xpaths the matrix declares as `supported` | After landing the code change, regen the cross-mesh artefacts (`CROSS_MESH_RESULTS.md` + `PHASE4_RECONCILIATION.md`) in a separate commit so the diff narrates "codec change" → "matrix delta" cleanly |
| A codec change affects translation behaviour for a pair covered by [`tools/demo.py`](tools/demo.py) (current pairs: `cisco_iosxe_cli` ↔ `juniper_junos`, `fortigate_cli` ↔ `mikrotik_routeros`, `aruba_aoss` ↔ `arista_eos`, `opnsense` ↔ `juniper_junos`) | Re-run `python tools/demo.py --pair <affected>` to verify the embedded synthetic config still translates cleanly.  If the rendered output's *shape* changed (added / dropped / reformatted lines that operators see), update the embedded source in `netcanon/tools/demo.py` to match what the codec now models, and update the paired walkthrough at [`docs/walkthroughs/<source>_to_<target>.md`](docs/walkthroughs/) — specifically the "What Netcanon does for you", "Tier-3 boundary", and "Manual review checklist" sections.  Operators reading the walkthrough should see what's new, what's gone, and what they should re-verify on devices already migrated under the previous wave's behaviour |
| A new codec ships that opens a narratively-distinct translation pair (different paradigm, different scope, or different operator workflow vs the existing four scenarios) | Add a new scenario to `netcanon/tools/demo.py` (`SCENARIOS` dict) AND a paired walkthrough at `docs/walkthroughs/<source>_to_<target>.md` in the same wave.  Update [`docs/walkthroughs/README.md`](docs/walkthroughs/README.md)'s table.  The 30-second "show me what this does" path Phase 4 established only stays valuable if the demo set keeps pace with the codec set |
| A change to the canonical model (`netcanon/migration/canonical/intent.py`) that adds a field demos *should* exercise | Update at least one `netcanon/tools/demo.py` scenario's embedded synthetic config to include the new field, so the demo output visibly shows the new translation surface.  Without this, operators running the demo see translations that look like they did before the canonical-field landed — the "show me what's new" surface goes stale |
| A demo-scenario change alters the rendered OUTPUT of `demo --pair cisco__junos` or `demo --pair fortigate__mikrotik` (the two landing-page hero pairs) | Regenerate the hero panes in [`site/index.html`](site/index.html) from the real command output AND re-author `site/og.png` as a crop of the default pane with the Tier-3 banner visible.  The landing page prints "this pane is the unedited output of" above a reproduce command — that sentence is only true while the panes track the scenarios, and `printed-commands-smoke.yml` re-proves it against `:latest` on every release publish |
| A packaging / distribution workflow change (`Dockerfile`, `.dockerignore`, `.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml`, `.github/workflows/pypi-publish.yml`, base-image bump, action-version bump, registry namespace change, signing / SBOM / attestation surface change, **new supply-chain integrity control such as a scanner, signing tool, allowlist, or workflow-hardening control**) | (1) [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) — verify every item in its own [§ "Updating This Document"](SECURITY.md#updating-this-document) trigger list: new dependency with security relevance → Dependency Supply Chain table; new untrusted-input handling → Input Validation section; new redaction category → Sanitiser section; new supply-chain integrity control → Supply-Chain Integrity section + Distribution channels sub-table.  Round-tripping SECURITY.md after release is the most common drift class — the v0.1.2 audit (`docs/docs-audit/2026-05-21/`) found 3 of 7 triggers met without SECURITY.md being updated.  (2) [`docs/IDENTITY.md`](docs/IDENTITY.md) "Distribution surfaces" table — every registry / namespace change has to update this canonical inventory.  (3) [`README.md`](README.md) Install section — Docker / pip / MSI examples have to match what the workflows actually publish.  (4) If the change adds a NEW Python version to the matrix in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, also add the matching `Programming Language :: Python :: X.Y` classifier in `pyproject.toml` so package metadata is consistent with what's tested.  (5) [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) Evolution roadmap "What's shipped" — add a release-anchored bullet when the change ships as part of a tagged release.  Distribution variants (Docker / pip / MSI) are not separate platforms (see "Parallel Platform Development" above), but their publish surface is operator-trust-load-bearing and drifts faster than the platform code itself |
| Cutting a new release | **Tag, push, done.**  No manual `pyproject.toml` version bump required — `setuptools_scm` derives the package version from the git tag automatically (`v0.1.0-rc5` → package version `0.1.0rc5` per PEP 440 normalization).  The publishing workflows pass the metadata-action's parsed version into the Docker builder stage as a `SETUPTOOLS_SCM_PRETEND_VERSION_FOR_NETCANON` build-arg so the container build doesn't need `.git/` in its context.  PyPI publish runs `python -m build` against the checked-out source tree (with `fetch-depth: 0` for the tag history) so setuptools_scm reads the tag directly there.  If a CI checkout step is added that runs `pip install -e .` or `python -m build`, it MUST set `fetch-depth: 0` — default shallow checkouts have no tags and setuptools_scm will fall back to `0.0.0`, which is a misleading silent-degradation rather than a loud failure.  The auto-generated `netcanon/_version.py` file is gitignored — never commit it. |
| A new wave of GitHub Code Scanning / Dependabot / secret-scanning alerts arrives (e.g. new scanner enabled, scanner version bump surfaces newly-covered rules, > 10 new alerts since last triage, pre-release gate) | Run a triage cycle per [`docs/security-triage/README.md`](docs/security-triage/README.md).  The process is dated-folder scaffolded so verdicts are reproducible: snapshot → cluster → parallel read-only agents → orchestrator synthesis → dismissals applied via `gh api` with `dismissed_reason` + `dismissed_comment`.  For one-off alerts arriving during normal development, fix or dismiss inline — don't spin up the full process.  Always set a free-text `dismissed_comment` so the next reader sees *why*; "won't fix" alone is opaque six months later |
| A sustained run of substantive change waves has landed (security cycle, codec wave, canonical-model expansion) or > 1 quarter has passed since the last hygiene pass, OR a release is being prepared and the "did the docs keep up" question is live | Run a documentation hygiene audit per [`docs/docs-audit/README.md`](docs/docs-audit/README.md).  Same scaffolding shape as `docs/security-triage/`: snapshot → 6-cluster taxonomy (interlinking / user-docs / developer-docs / codec-docstrings / platform-docstrings / tests-changelog) → parallel read-only Opus 4.7 1M agents → orchestrator synthesis → Stage 2 fix execution commit-by-commit.  Cluster labels are stable across runs so future-you searching for "the codec-docstring audit pattern" finds prior investigations under the same name.  For one-off doc updates landing alongside their code change, just use the rows in this Documentation Sync Checklist — don't spin up the full process |
| A new redaction category lands in `netcanon/tools/sanitize.py` (a new canonical field added to `_SubstitutionTable` + matching `sanitize_intent` walk + corresponding `_REDACTION_RULES` entry) | (1) [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) § "Sanitiser (Bug-Reporting Workflow)" — list the new category in the redaction-rule table; (2) [`BUG_REPORTING.md`](BUG_REPORTING.md) § "What gets sanitised" — operator-facing rule list + per-category counter scheme; (3) [`docs/CAPABILITIES.md`](docs/CAPABILITIES.md) if the category exposes a new sanitised surface operators see in the migrate-page banners.  This row exists because SECURITY.md's own "Updating This Document" trigger list demands it but the round-trip through SECURITY.md is brittle — contributors find this row in the doc-sync table first |
| A new shared transform under `netcanon/migration/canonical/transforms.py` (e.g. `project_svi_to_vlan`, `_natural_port_sort_key`) | (1) [`netcanon/migration/codecs/README.md`](netcanon/migration/codecs/README.md) "Cross-codec shared utilities" — every codec that consumes the transform should be greppable from one place; (2) [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) "Cross-cutting render-time policies" — add a one-paragraph entry if the transform introduces a new policy class (rather than a per-codec utility).  Pattern: this row exists because transforms.py additions have shipped in Wave 7c + Wave 10γ-3 with codecs/README updates but no doc-sync row demanding it; the next addition shouldn't need maintainer memory to keep the chain intact |
| A new top-level migration-package sibling at `netcanon/migration/_*.py` (e.g. `_user_secrets.py`, `_naming.py`, `_tier3_detection.py`) | (1) [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) "Cross-cutting render-time policies" — add a one-paragraph entry naming the new sibling + its rationale; (2) [`netcanon/migration/codecs/README.md`](netcanon/migration/codecs/README.md) "Cross-codec shared utilities" if codecs consume the new sibling.  All three current siblings (`_user_secrets.py`, `_naming.py`, `_tier3_detection.py`) ARE documented but the row that demands it has been absent — close that gap |
| A codec gains an entry in `unsupported_rename_categories` (a Tier-2 category that the codec's parse + render don't yet round-trip end-to-end, surfacing as a per-pane-overrides banner for that codec as target) | (1) [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) "Per-pane overrides" § "Current state" — list the codec + category + reason (parse doesn't capture / render doesn't emit / both); (2) The codec's own `__init__.py` or `codec.py` module docstring — note the limitation so contributors reading the codec see it without round-tripping through ARCHITECTURE.md.  The 2026-05-21 audit caught OPNsense + Cisco IOS-XE NETCONF declaring `{"snmpv3"}` while ARCHITECTURE.md claimed every codec was empty post-Option-A; this row exists so the next addition doesn't repeat the drift |
| A new fixture-research catalogue lands at `docs/fixture-research-<year>/` or a substantial WANTED.md update marks new shipped / closed items | (1) [`README.md`](README.md) "What's next" section — pointer to the catalogue if it's load-bearing for the v0.X.Y backlog; (2) [`docs/RELEASE_PLAN.md`](docs/RELEASE_PLAN.md) Status block — mark items shipped that have actually shipped (don't carry "Next: v0.1.0 final" forward after v0.1.1 / v0.1.2 / etc. tag).  Low-priority row: typically the v0.X.Y-planning folder is the source of truth and updates land via cluster-C dev-doc audits |

Rule of thumb: if a future contributor could plausibly search for the
thing you just added and not find its rationale, there's a doc gap
to close.

---

## Cross-reference discipline

Every doc in `tests/`, `docs/`, and top-level `*.md` should open with
(or end with) a "See also" line pointing to its two or three closest
peers.  Concretely:

* `tests/README.md` → `testid_reference.md`, `fixtures/real/RESULTS.md`,
  `fixtures/real/NOTICE.md`
* `ARCHITECTURE.md` → `netcanon/definitions/library/README.md`,
  `netcanon/migration/codecs/README.md`,
  `netcanon/migration/canonical/README.md`,
  `tests/fixtures/real/RESULTS.md`
* `README.md` → `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `tests/README.md`

A contributor who lands on one doc should be one hop from the others.
When you add a new sibling doc, add the reciprocal link in the
existing peers in the same commit — one-way cross-references rot
faster than numbers do.

---

## Code Organisation

See [`tests/README.md`](tests/README.md) for the full test-tier
layout (sub-trees under `tests/unit/` for `audit/`, `api/`,
`definitions/`, `migration/`, `tools/`, plus the integration / e2e /
desktop tiers) and the top-level repo tree
(`netcanon/`, `netcanon_desktop/`, `netcanon/definitions/library/target_profiles/`,
`tools/`).  Top-level orientation lives in
[`README.md`](README.md)'s "Layout" section.

---

## Selectors

All interactive HTML elements **must** carry `data-testid` attributes.  E2E
tests use these exclusively — never CSS classes or element structure.  See
`tests/testid_reference.md` for the full inventory.

---

## Hard Rules (Never Break)

- **Never** add a feature to one platform without adding it to the other
  (unless explicitly listed under Platform-Specific Exceptions above).
- **Never** use `terminal length 0` for Cisco paging.  Use space-injection
  via `connection.cisco_more_paging: true` in the YAML definition.
- **Never** commit real credentials, device IPs, or secrets.
- **Never** skip `data-testid` attributes on new interactive template elements.
- **Never** author a `type_key` containing `_` or `.` in a device-definition
  YAML.  These characters are the separators the file-store filename grammar
  uses (`{type_key}_{safe_host}_{ts}.{ext}`), so an underscore or dot inside
  `type_key` makes the filename parse mathematically ambiguous (the lazy
  `.+?` would absorb only the leading token, mis-locating the file on
  `resolve_path`).  Use a single-token CamelCase vendor key like `Cisco`,
  `Aruba`, `Juniper`.  Enforced by `DeviceDefinition.type_key_filename_safe`
  at load time and by the file-store regex at parse time — both BD-Aruba
  and BD-Arista independently rediscovered this trap before the validator
  existed (commit `ba72502`), which is why the rule lives here now.
- **Never** land a code change without updating the docs it renders stale.
  The "Documentation Sync Checklist" above is concrete — if a row applies
  to your change, touch the listed doc in the same commit.  Follow-up
  doc-only commits are acceptable for retroactive audits of pre-existing
  drift (e.g. the audit that added this rule), NOT for fresh code that
  shipped without its docs.  Stale docs are a bug; they just don't crash
  loud enough to be caught by CI, which is why the discipline has to live
  in the workflow.
- **Never** hard-code a count, LOC figure, or test tally in prose
  documentation (`README.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, sub-READMEs) unless the
  same commit adds a CI or test guard that keeps the number honest.
  Use qualitative phrasing ("the largest template in the app", "dozens
  of target profiles across six vendors") or link to the authoritative
  source (`pytest --collect-only`, the file itself, `RESULTS.md`).
  Numbers in *test assertions* fail loudly and are fine; numbers in
  *prose* rot silently.  Retroactive purge of existing stale numbers is
  encouraged — removal counts as fixing.  Archival records in
  `CHANGELOG.md` (as-of-this-commit pass counts, historical LOC deltas)
  are exempt — they're timestamps, not current-state claims.
- **Never** patch `ConnectHandler` or `paramiko.SSHClient` directly in tests —
  patch `netcanon.api.routes.backups.get_collector` instead (the single
  factory used by the backup route).
- **Never** assert on the POST `/api/v1/backups` response body for final job
  state — it always returns `pending` (the job runs in the background).  Since
  #27 the job runs on a dedicated executor (`backup_runner.submit_backup_job`),
  NOT synchronously before the response — even under `TestClient` — so do not
  assume it has finished the instant the POST returns.  **Poll** `GET /{id}`
  until the status is terminal (`completed`/`partial`/`failed`): use the
  `wait_for_job(client, job_id)` helper in `tests/conftest.py` (the integration
  `client` fixture applies it automatically after a backups POST).
- **Never** change the signatures of the existing pipeline-stage functions
  in `netcanon/services/migration_pipeline.py`.  API routes and dozens of
  tests depend on their exact shape.  Later phases add NEW public
  functions; existing stages stay frozen.  See the module docstring.
- **Never** commit real credential hashes to test fixtures.  Synthetic
  hashes in test input should LOOK like real hashes but be obviously
  fake (e.g. `$9$fake$hash`, `ENC fakeEncodedHash==`).  Third-party
  real captures from published repos are OK — their hashes are already
  public.  See `tests/fixtures/real/NOTICE.md` for provenance conventions.
- **Never** ship a user-facing feature or capability change without
  updating the operator-facing docs that describe it.  The doc-sync
  table's "user-facing feature ships or changes" row enumerates the
  targets: `docs/vendors/<vendor>.md`, `docs/CAPABILITIES.md`,
  `BUG_REPORTING.md`, `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`, `docs/HOW_WE_TEST.md`.
  Touch every one that's affected in the same commit / wave as the
  feature — operator-facing prose drifts faster than code, and
  "the docs lied to me" is what differentiates Netcanon's
  matrix-honesty discipline from the over-claiming alternatives in
  this space.
- **Never** let a failable step sit between publishing an artifact and
  signing it.  `Build and push` in `docker-publish.yml` makes every tag
  live — `:latest` included — the instant it completes, and a failing step
  aborts the job *with the tag still moved*, so the unsigned window is
  permanent rather than transient.  Install prerequisite tooling BEFORE the
  push; put sign / SBOM / attest / verify immediately after it; demote
  scanning and reporting to the end and mark them `continue-on-error`.
  Failure mode: three failable steps once sat in that window and a GitHub
  Code Scanning outage alone was sufficient to ship an unsigned release
  (#441).  Note `if: always()` does NOT make a step non-fatal — it governs
  whether the step RUNS after an earlier failure, not whether its own
  failure propagates.  This rule is GENERAL, not about one file:
  `demo-publish.yml` had drifted into all three violations while the
  guard named only `docker-publish.yml`, so nothing caught it.  Guarded
  by `tests/unit/test_docker_publish_signing_window.py`, which is
  parametrised over both workflows — add any new publishing workflow to
  its `_CASES` table in the same PR that creates it.
- **Never** let an unrecognised secret classify as plaintext.  A classifier
  whose final branch is "anything I don't recognise is a literal password"
  fails OPEN on credential material: the digest is then re-emitted under the
  target's cleartext marker and BECOMES the password.  A bare crypt string
  carrying no algorithm tag — the form VyOS stores natively — did exactly
  this on 14 of 14 records, while both capability matrices declared the
  field SUPPORTED so the migration reported no loss at all.  Classify
  structured secrets by prefix, and make the default for an unmodelled
  `$id$` shape REFUSE migration.  Order matters when fixing this: recognise
  the known forms FIRST, then close the default — flipping the default
  first refuses every real record at once, which is a false-positive blast
  rather than a fix.  Note that refusing a secret drops the whole account,
  so the paired expectation YAMLs must be re-authored in the same change
  (doc-sync 178).  Guarded by
  `tests/unit/migration/test_secret_fail_open.py`.
  Classification is only half of it: **every codec that renders a local
  user must call `is_migratable()`**.  Four did not until #461, and two of
  them wrote foreign digests behind a cleartext marker regardless of how
  well the secret was classified.  A new user-rendering codec goes in
  `_USER_RENDERING_TARGETS` in that test file, which fails for any render
  path that skips the gate.
  And never let a TAG decide the algorithm when the tag cannot be trusted:
  a vendor envelope (`junos:`) or a parser that tags everything one way
  (OPNsense `bcrypt:` over a `$6$` body) must defer to the payload's own
  crypt(3) id (#462).  Fails closed, but refuses every account it mislabels.
- **Never** express a CI tool version as a RANGE and call it pinned, and
  never repeat that version in a second file.  CI installs fresh on every
  run and pip resolves to the newest match, so a range silently adopts
  releases: `ruff>=0.15,<0.16` took 0.15.18 through 0.15.22 with no PR and
  no review (#442).  Pin exactly, in the manifest Dependabot watches
  (`pyproject.toml` — a pin buried in a workflow `run:` block is invisible
  to it and freezes the tool instead), and have the workflow DERIVE the
  value rather than restate it — a duplicated constraint is what makes a
  dependency-bump PR inert, since the gate and the declared dependency can
  disagree with nothing noticing.  Guarded by
  `tests/unit/test_ruff_pin_is_exact.py`.
- **Never** author or change a codec's `device_classes[0]` without applying
  the scope test.  A codec's **first** entry in `device_classes` — declared in
  `netcanon/migration/vendors/<vendor>.yaml` and mirrored in its
  `CapabilityMatrix` — is its **primary device class**, and that single field
  is the project's authoritative scope declaration for the platform.  Order is
  therefore load-bearing: re-ordering an existing codec's classes is a scope
  change, not a tidy-up.

  A platform is **`firewall`-primary** when **both** hold:
  **(a)** the modal *real* config of that platform is majority Tier-3 by
  volume — the canonical model covers a minority of what an operator actually
  wrote; **and**
  **(b)** the platform is not deployed as a switching or routing NOS in its own
  right, so its L2/L3 surface is incidental rather than the reason the box
  exists.

  Both clauses are required.  Clause (a) alone would take `cisco_iosxr`
  (MPLS / IS-IS / route-policy dominate real SP configs) — clause (b) saves it.
  Clause (b) alone would take nothing.  Junos is the worked example of why the
  test is two-clause and not one: Junos ships on SRX firewalls and declares
  `firewall`, but it is `switch`-primary because EX / QFX / MX are Junos boxes
  in their own right.

  **What `firewall`-primary means, operationally.**  Netcanon translates that
  platform's L2/L3 layer only.  Such a codec **must not** be a landing-page
  hero pane, **must not** be the landing-page capability-matrix excerpt, and
  **must not** be more than one of the four `netcanon/tools/demo.py` scenarios.
  It **may** ship, be certified, hold fixtures, be auto-detected, be
  sanitisable, and participate fully in the cross-mesh audit as a source.
  Enforced by [`tests/unit/migration/test_scope_boundary.py`](tests/unit/migration/test_scope_boundary.py),
  which pins the roster, asserts the codec ↔ vendor-YAML agreement, and
  ratchets the demo-scenario count.  ⚠️ The scenario clause is **not yet met**:
  HEAD carries two firewall-primary scenarios (`fortigate__mikrotik`,
  `opnsense__junos`) and the guard ratchets at 2 with a target of 1, because
  closing it re-authors a demo scenario and drags the hero pane, `og.png` and
  the paired walkthrough with it.  Lower the ratchet when that wave lands;
  never raise it.

  Rationale: the scope complaint this rule answers was *perception weight*,
  not correctness — nothing over-claimed, but two of twelve codecs held a
  disproportionate share of the product's shop window.  Encoding the answer in
  `device_classes[0]` means it is read from a declaration rather than
  re-derived from a measurement every time someone asks.  Full workings in
  `docs/reviews/2026-08-10-firewall-scope-exit/`.
- **Never** push to an online / public repository (GitHub, GitLab,
  Bitbucket, GHCR, Docker Hub, PyPI, or any other off-machine
  destination — including private repos that may later go public,
  including container images and PyPI distributions) without first
  explicitly reviewing the diff for PII and identifying network
  information.  Scope of review:
  * **Operator personal data** — emails, names, geographic
    identifiers in author / committer metadata; banner / comment /
    description text; hostname patterns tied to the operator
    (`<operator-id>-fortigate`, `<operator-domain>.lan`).
  * **Real-world network identifiers** — public WAN IPs, real
    device hostnames, real MAC addresses, real serial numbers,
    internal-domain references.
  * **Encrypted secrets and key material** — `ENC <base64>` blobs,
    `$9$` / `$5$` / `$6$` / `$2y$` hashes, SSH public/private keys,
    certificate chains.  These are **operator-traceable even when
    encrypted** — never assume "encrypted" = safe to publish.
  * **Accidentally-tracked operator backups** under `configs/` /
    `devices/` / `schedules/` / `jobs/` (gitignore is not
    retroactive — files added before the ignore rule landed stay
    tracked).
  * **Narrative-exposure** — docs / CHANGELOG / NOTICE prose that
    describes what was sanitised by *naming* the real value
    (`real WAN IP <X> replaced with...`).  The sanitisation
    narrative itself must not leak the value it claims to redact.

  Sanitise via the Phase 4.5 helper (`netcanon sanitize` or
  `POST /api/v1/sanitize`) where the operator-data shape applies;
  hand-redact narrative / metadata refs the helper doesn't cover;
  use `git filter-repo` to scrub history when a secret has already
  been committed (Phase 1 wave is the reference workflow — see the
  `[Unreleased]` CHANGELOG entry for the four-pass recipe).

  After sanitisation, **judge whether a test re-run is warranted**:
  if the changes touched code or fixtures the test suite exercises,
  re-run the affected tier (`pytest tests/unit` for code-only
  changes; `pytest tests/integration` if API surface is touched;
  full suite for substantive changes).  Sanitisation edits can
  break tests in subtle ways (renamed fields, redacted-marker
  introduction in narrative-asserting tests).  Always verify
  rather than assume.

## Ultracode runs (multi-agent reviews)

Multi-agent reviews, audits, and research follow netcanon's two-stage process:
**read-only agents each write one report into `docs/reviews/<UTC-date>-<slug>/`
→ the main thread reconciles into a synthesis + fix-plan and is the sole actor
that verifies and commits.** The full process, run-folder convention, seed
template, cluster taxonomy, and dispatch heuristics live in
[`docs/agent-workflow.md`](docs/agent-workflow.md) (the
[`docs/security-triage/`](docs/security-triage/) and
[`docs/docs-audit/`](docs/docs-audit/) processes are worked instances).

**Ultracode runs use the reusable file-per-agent blackboard runner**
([`.claude/workflows/blackboard.js`](.claude/workflows/blackboard.js), via the
`Workflow` tool with `scriptPath: .claude/workflows/blackboard.js`) — never
hand-rolled. Each agent writes ONE long-form report under the run dir, reads
peers' reports for cross-phase comms, and returns only a short pointer/summary;
the main thread writes the `00-blackboard.md` seed up front and the
`99-synthesis.md` reconciliation after, then actuates under the Hard Rules
above (pseudonym identity, explicit staging, the cross-mesh proof bar,
confirm-before-merge). The runner bakes the read-only contract in so it can't
drift. See [`docs/agent-workflow.md`](docs/agent-workflow.md) § Ultracode runs.
