# AGENTS.md

Guidance for coding agents working in `reticulum_mobile_emergency_management`.

## Project Snapshot

- This repository is a mixed workspace:
  - `apps/mobile`: Vue 3 + Vite + Capacitor mobile/web client
  - `packages/node-client`: TypeScript bridge used by the app to talk to the native plugin surface
  - `crates/reticulum_mobile`: Rust runtime, UniFFI bridge, and LXMF/Reticulum integration
  - `tools/codegen`: UniFFI binding generation scripts
  - `e2e`: Playwright end-to-end coverage
- Primary product focus is emergency coordination over Reticulum mesh networking, including peer discovery, action messages, event replication, and telemetry.

## Working Rules

- Start from the repo root unless a package-specific command clearly belongs elsewhere.
- Check `git status` before editing. This repo often has generated Android/Rust artifacts in the worktree.
- Do not hand-edit generated or build output unless the task is explicitly about generated artifacts or native packaging.
- Keep fixes scoped. A UI change should not casually rewrite transport or runtime behavior.
- Prefer updating the real source of truth rather than patching copied artifacts.
- Use the compiled `LXMF-rs` implementation through the existing Rust bridge and generated bindings. Do not recreate LXMF protocol functionality in TypeScript, Vue stores, or ad hoc Rust compatibility code when the compiled library already provides it.

## High-Value Directories

- `apps/mobile/src/views`: route-level screens
- `apps/mobile/src/components`: reusable UI pieces
- `apps/mobile/src/stores`: Pinia stores; most app behavior lives here
- `apps/mobile/src/utils`: protocol helpers, peer parsing, replication helpers, mission sync helpers
- `apps/mobile/src/services`: platform-facing helpers such as sharing, notifications, telemetry helpers
- `apps/mobile/src/types/domain.ts`: shared app domain types
- `packages/node-client/src/index.ts`: TS client boundary for the native bridge
- `crates/reticulum_mobile/src/runtime.rs`: main Rust runtime behavior
- `crates/reticulum_mobile/src/sdk_bridge.rs`: SDK-facing LXMF bridge layer
- `crates/reticulum_mobile/src/jni_bridge.rs`: native boundary used by the mobile side
- `crates/reticulum_mobile/src/reticulum_mobile.udl`: UniFFI interface definition
- `docs/architecture.md`: transport and replication architecture notes

## Generated And Volatile Paths

Treat these as generated or disposable unless the task explicitly targets them:

- `node_modules/`
- `target/`
- `playwright-report/`
- `test-results/`
- `tmp/`
- `apps/tmp-playwright-ui.err`
- `apps/mobile/tmp-playwright-ui.err`
- `apps/mobile/android/app/build/`
- `apps/mobile/android/app/src/main/jniLibs/`
- `apps/mobile/android/uniffi/`
- `apps/mobile/ios/uniffi/`

On Windows, broad recursive directory scans can fail inside Android build intermediates. Prefer scoped searches over targeted source directories instead of walking the entire repo.

## Expected App Conventions

- Vue code is written with Vue 3 Composition API and `<script setup lang="ts">`.
- TypeScript is `strict` in both the app and `packages/node-client`.
- Pinia stores hold most stateful behavior. Keep business logic in stores and utilities, not inside view templates.
- Reuse existing domain types from `apps/mobile/src/types/domain.ts` before inventing near-duplicates.
- Keep wire/protocol helpers centralized in `apps/mobile/src/utils` and Rust runtime files rather than scattering message-shape logic across components.
- App-wide button press feedback is defined on global `button` rules in `apps/mobile/src/styles.css`; component buttons should set the existing CSS custom properties rather than adding one-off `:active` behavior.
- Maintain the existing style conventions in touched files:
  - double quotes
  - semicolons
  - explicit typing when it improves clarity at boundaries

## Rust Skills Integration

Apply these additional rules whenever a task touches Rust code, `Cargo.toml`, or the UniFFI/native bridge:

- Treat the installed Rust skills bundle as the default routing layer for Rust work:
  - general Rust questions or ambiguous Rust tasks: `rust-router`
  - ownership, borrowing, lifetimes, and move errors: `m01-ownership`
  - smart pointers and resource ownership patterns: `m02-resource`
  - error modeling and propagation: `m06-error-handling`
  - async, `Send`/`Sync`, threading, and channels: `m07-concurrency`
  - `unsafe`, FFI, raw pointers, JNI, and bridge boundary reviews: `unsafe-checker`
- For new Rust crates or new `Cargo.toml` package sections created in this repo, default to:
  - `edition = "2024"`
  - `rust-version = "1.85"`
  - `[lints.rust] unsafe_code = "warn"`
  - `[lints.clippy] all = "warn"` and `pedantic = "warn"`
- Prefer domain-correct design fixes over borrow-checker workarounds. Do not reach for cloning or ownership duplication until the ownership model is justified by the runtime and protocol design.
- Use `?` and typed error propagation in library/runtime code instead of `unwrap()` or `expect()`, unless a crash is intentionally part of the boundary behavior.
- Every `unsafe` block must carry a nearby `// SAFETY:` comment that states the invariant making the block sound.
- Keep Rust changes aligned with the existing project architecture in this file, especially the rules about using the compiled `LXMF-rs` implementation through the current bridge instead of recreating protocol behavior in higher layers.

## Change Routing

Use this map to decide where a change belongs:

- UI layout, forms, route behavior:
  - `apps/mobile/src/views`
  - `apps/mobile/src/components`
- Persisted app state, peer lists, message/event/telemetry workflows:
  - `apps/mobile/src/stores`
- Wire format, mission sync, peer parsing, announce capability logic:
  - `apps/mobile/src/utils`
- Capacitor-facing TypeScript API surface:
  - `packages/node-client/src/index.ts`
- Native runtime behavior, packet/LXMF handling, delivery tracking:
  - `crates/reticulum_mobile/src/runtime.rs`
  - `crates/reticulum_mobile/src/sdk_bridge.rs`
  - `crates/reticulum_mobile/src/jni_bridge.rs`
- UniFFI interface or generated mobile bindings:
  - `crates/reticulum_mobile/src/reticulum_mobile.udl`
  - then run the appropriate `tools/codegen` script instead of editing copied bindings by hand

## Build And Verification Commands

Run the narrowest command set that proves the change:

- Install JS dependencies:
  - `npm install`
- App development:
  - `npm run web:dev`
  - `npm run mobile:dev`
- Builds:
  - `npm run web:build`
  - `npm run mobile:build`
  - `npm --workspace packages/node-client run build`
- Capacitor native workflow:
  - `npm --workspace apps/mobile run sync`
  - `npm --workspace apps/mobile run android`
  - `npm --workspace apps/mobile run ios`
  - Current project release work does not target iOS compilation. For Android packaging, prefer `npx cap sync android` from `apps/mobile` instead of full `npm --workspace apps/mobile run sync`, because full sync also tries the iOS CocoaPods step.
- Type checking:
  - `npm --workspace apps/mobile run typecheck`
- E2E:
  - `npx playwright install chromium`
  - `npm run test:e2e`
  - `npm run test:e2e:headed`
  - `npm run test:e2e:debug`
- Rust:
  - `cargo test --manifest-path crates/reticulum_mobile/Cargo.toml`
- UniFFI code generation:
  - PowerShell: `./tools/codegen/generate-uniffi-bindings.ps1 -Language kotlin`
  - PowerShell: `./tools/codegen/generate-uniffi-bindings.ps1 -Language swift`
  - Shell: `./tools/codegen/generate-uniffi-bindings.sh kotlin`
  - Shell: `./tools/codegen/generate-uniffi-bindings.sh swift`
- Android release artifacts:
  - From `apps/mobile/android`: `cmd /c gradlew.bat assembleRelease bundleRelease`

There is no dedicated root lint script at the moment. For most app changes, `typecheck` + the relevant build + the closest Playwright spec is the minimum useful validation.

## Cross-Layer Change Rules

- If you change a payload shape or delivery flow in TypeScript, verify whether the same change must be reflected in:
  - `apps/mobile/src/utils/missionSync.ts`
  - `apps/mobile/src/utils/replicationParser.ts`
  - `packages/node-client/src/index.ts`
  - `crates/reticulum_mobile/src/jni_bridge.rs`
  - `crates/reticulum_mobile/src/runtime.rs`
  - `docs/architecture.md`
- Preserve the current architecture where LXMF behavior comes from compiled `LXMF-rs` code. Extend the bridge or SDK integration when needed, but do not duplicate encoding, delivery tracking, or protocol logic in higher layers just to bypass the compiled library.
- If you change the UniFFI contract, regenerate bindings instead of editing generated outputs manually.
- If you change event or telemetry behavior, update or add the closest Playwright coverage in `e2e/`.
- If transport behavior changes, document the new flow in `docs/architecture.md` or the relevant README.

## Environment Notes

- `crates/reticulum_mobile/Cargo.toml` currently points `lxmf` and `lxmf-sdk` to local path dependencies. Do not replace those paths casually; they reflect this workspace's current development setup.
- Android signing uses local, ignored configuration under `apps/mobile/android/keystore.properties`.
- This project currently does not try to compile for iOS. Do not treat iOS build or CocoaPods failures as release blockers unless the user explicitly asks for iOS work.
- Root Playwright config starts the web app and exercises the app through the browser at `/dashboard`.

## Definition Of Done

Before finishing, make sure you can state:

- what changed
- which layer(s) were touched
- which verification commands were run
- whether any generated artifacts were intentionally updated
- whether docs or tests were updated to match behavior changes
