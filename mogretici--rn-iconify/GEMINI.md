# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

rn-iconify is a React Native library providing 268,000+ Iconify icons with native MMKV caching and full TypeScript autocomplete. It supports 200+ icon sets and includes features like animation presets, theme providers, and React Navigation integration.

## Build & Development Commands

```bash
# Build the library (outputs to lib/)
npm run build

# Type checking
npm run typecheck

# Linting
npm run lint
npm run lint:fix

# Format code
npm run format
npm run format:check

# Run all tests
npm run test

# Run a single test file
npm test -- src/__tests__/CacheManager.test.ts

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Generate icon set components from Iconify registry
npm run generate-components
```

## Architecture

### Core Icon Rendering Flow

1. **Icon Components** (`src/components/*.tsx`) - 200+ auto-generated components (e.g., `Mdi`, `Heroicons`, `Lucide`) created via `createIconSet()` factory
2. **createIconSet** (`src/createIconSet.tsx`) - Factory that creates typed icon components with theme integration
3. **IconRenderer** (`src/IconRenderer.tsx`) - Core rendering component that handles cache lookup, network fetching, placeholders, and SVG rendering via react-native-svg

### Multi-Layer Cache System

Located in `src/cache/`, the cache follows this priority:

1. **MemoryCache** - In-memory Map, instant access (~0ms)
2. **Bundled Icons** - Pre-bundled at build time via Babel plugin
3. **DiskCache** - MMKV-based persistent storage (~1-5ms via JSI)
4. **Native Cache** - Optional native module for background prefetching
5. **Network** - Fetches from Iconify API as last resort

`CacheManager.ts` orchestrates all cache layers and promotes items up the chain for faster subsequent access.

### Babel Plugin (`src/babel/`)

Build-time optimization that:

- Scans JSX for icon component usage and `prefetchIcons()` calls
- Collects icon names during Metro bundling
- Generates offline icon bundles with pre-fetched SVG data

Key files:

- `plugin.ts` - Main visitor that detects icon usage
- `collector.ts` - Aggregates found icons across files
- `cache-writer.ts` - Generates the bundle file

### CLI (`src/cli/`)

Commands available via `npx rn-iconify`:

- `bundle` - Generate offline icon bundles from source analysis
- `analyze` - Analyze icon usage and output reports

### Module Exports

The package exports multiple entry points:

- `rn-iconify` - Main entry with all icon components and utilities
- `rn-iconify/babel` - Babel plugin for build-time optimization
- `rn-iconify/navigation` - React Navigation helpers (tab icons, drawer icons, header icons)
- `rn-iconify/animated` - Animation presets and utilities

### Key Subsystems

- **Theme** (`src/theme/`) - Global icon styling via `IconThemeProvider`
- **Alias** (`src/alias/`) - Custom icon name mapping via `IconAliasProvider`
- **Animation** (`src/animated/`) - 6 animation presets (spin, pulse, bounce, etc.)
- **Accessibility** (`src/accessibility/`) - A11y utilities and high contrast support
- **Placeholder** (`src/placeholder/`) - Loading states (skeleton, pulse, shimmer)
- **Explorer** (`src/explorer/`) - Dev-mode icon browser component

### Component Generation

`scripts/generate-components.ts` fetches icon metadata from Iconify API and generates typed components in `src/components/`. Each component exports icon names as a const object for TypeScript autocomplete.

**Every generated key is public API.** An application can pass any of them to
`name=`, so removing one is a breaking change — and it is invisible inside a
diff of thousands of generated lines.

Iconify renames icons regularly and keeps the old name as an alias:
`pinhead:five` became `pinhead:5`, `fluent:text-add-28-filled` became
`text-add-t-28-filled`. Generating from the icon list alone drops those names
here for a rename this package never made. One sync did exactly that to 76
names while describing itself as a feature, which would have shipped as a
minor release.

Two things keep that from happening again:

- `scripts/icon-aliases.ts` keeps renamed names, emitting them as
  `oldName: 'currentName'`. `createIconSet` resolves a string value to the icon
  it points at, so the old name keeps working. It also keeps icons Iconify has
  *hidden* — those left the listing but the API still serves valid SVG for
  them, so removing them takes working icons away for a decision upstream did
  not make. One sync would have dropped 152 of them from `solar` alone.
- `scripts/report-icon-changes.ts` compares the names before and after a run.
  The sync workflow puts the summary on the pull request and, if anything was
  removed, marks the commit `feat!:` so semantic-release cuts a major.

Both are pure and unit-tested in `scripts/__tests__/`; the runtime half is
covered by the `mapped names` tests in `src/__tests__/createIconSet.test.tsx`.

## Bundle size

Applications import from the barrel — `import { Mdi } from 'rn-iconify'` — and
tree-shaking is what keeps that from pulling in all 226 icon sets. Two things
have to hold for it to work, and both have been broken before:

- The root `package.json` declares `sideEffects: false`.
- The build writes that **into `lib/module/package.json`** as well. A bundler
  resolving `lib/module/index.js` reads the nearest manifest, which is that
  file — not the one at the root. It once contained only `{"type":"module"}`,
  so every module counted as side-effectful and one icon set cost 792 kB
  instead of 36 kB.

`size-limit` measures an actual import (`{ Mdi }`), not the whole barrel.
Measuring the barrel says nothing useful: nobody imports every set, the figure
grows on every icon sync, and the limit would simply be raised until it stopped
catching anything. `src/__tests__/packaging.test.ts` guards the manifest.

## Testing

Tests use Jest with react-native preset. Test files are in `src/__tests__/`.

Coverage thresholds are not a single number — `jest.config.js` sets branches
69, functions 83, lines 80, statements 80. They sit just under the current
figures on purpose, so a drop fails the run rather than going unnoticed.

Jest runs on Node, which has web globals that Hermes does not. A test that
reaches for one of those passes here and fails on a device — `DOMException`
did exactly that. When testing behaviour around an API the runtime may not
have, delete the global for the duration of the test rather than trusting the
environment.

## Peer Dependencies

Requires: `react`, `react-native`, `react-native-mmkv`, `react-native-svg`
