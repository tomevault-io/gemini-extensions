# Agent Guidelines for solid-ml-server

## Hard Constraints

**NEVER use opam commands or access .opam or _opam folders, except inside `examples/ssr_api_app/Dockerfile` when installing Melange for the Docker build.**

This project builds with `/home/sabine/.opam/landing-pages-build/bin/dune` (dune 3.20.2) which is configured to work with the system OCaml installation. Do not use `opam` commands or reference any packages in `.opam/` or `_opam/` directories, except for the Dockerfile exception above. Always use the dune binary specified in the Makefile's `DUNE` variable.

**Git workflow:** Always use rebase (not merge) when integrating remote changes before pushing.

**Branch/PR workflow:** Work in a feature branch (not `main`) and open a pull request for each session's feature/fix. Do not stack PRs: keep exactly one active PR per session and wait for it to be merged (or explicitly closed) before starting another PR branch.

**Examples policy:** When adding a user-facing feature, update all relevant examples in the same session/PR to demonstrate the new capability. Do not defer example updates to a later stacked PR.

## Product Stage Policy

This project is still in an early stage. Prioritize DX and simplicity over API stability.

- Prefer simple, obvious, ergonomic solutions over complex compatibility layers.
- It is acceptable to change APIs when it meaningfully improves usability.
- Do not block improvements for backward compatibility concerns at this stage.
- When you introduce a breaking change, update docs/tests in the same change so migration is clear.

## Architecture

### Shared Core (`solid-ml-internal`)

The project uses a **functor-based architecture** to share reactive algorithms between server and browser:

```
solid-ml-internal/
├── types.ml           # Internal types (Obj.t for type erasure, phantom types for safety)
├── backend.ml         # Backend.S module type + Backend.Global implementation
├── reactive_functor.ml # Make(Backend) functor with all reactive algorithms
└── solid_ml_internal.ml
```

**Key insight:** The only platform difference is how the current runtime is stored:
- Server: Domain-local storage (thread-safe isolation per domain)
- Browser: Global ref (safe in single-threaded JS)

### Server (`solid-ml-server`)

```ocaml
(* Defines DLS backend and instantiates functor *)
module Backend_DLS : Internal.Backend.S = struct
  let runtime_key = Domain.DLS.new_key (fun () -> None)
  let get_runtime () = Domain.DLS.get runtime_key
  let set_runtime rt = Domain.DLS.set runtime_key rt
  let handle_error exn _ = raise exn
end

module R = Internal.Reactive_functor.Make(Backend_DLS)
```

### Browser (`solid-ml-browser`)

```ocaml
(* Defines global ref backend with console.error *)
module Backend_Browser : Internal.Backend.S = struct
  let current_runtime = ref None
  let get_runtime () = !current_runtime
  let set_runtime rt = current_runtime := rt
  let handle_error exn context =
    console_error ("solid-ml-server: Error in " ^ context ^ ": " ^ Printexc.to_string exn)
end

module R = Internal.Reactive_functor.Make(Backend_Browser)
```

### Type Safety

The internal types use `Obj.t` for type erasure (needed for heterogeneous collections), but expose type-safe APIs via phantom types:

```ocaml
(* Internal: untyped *)
type signal_state = { mutable value: Obj.t; ... }

(* Public: typed via phantom type parameter *)
type 'a signal = signal_state  (* 'a is phantom *)

let create_typed_signal (type a) ?equals (initial : a) : a signal =
  { value = Obj.repr initial; ... }

let read_typed_signal (type a) (s : a signal) : a =
  Obj.obj s.value
```

- Keep implementations simple - optimize later

## Design Principles

1. **Fine-grained reactivity** - No virtual DOM, signals update only what depends on them
2. **Automatic tracking** - Reading a signal inside an effect/memo auto-subscribes
3. **Server/client isomorphism** - Same component code works on server (HTML) and client (DOM)
4. **Type safety** - Full OCaml type checking for UI code
5. **Shared core** - One implementation of reactive algorithms, platform-specific backends
6. **MLX syntax** - JSX-like templates via the mlx package

## Known Limitations

- Browser: Multiple independent apps on same page share global state
- Server: Each `Runtime.run` is fully isolated

**Important:** Signals should not be shared across runtimes or domains.

## Differences from SolidJS

solid-ml-server aims to match SolidJS semantics closely. Here are the known differences:

### Implemented Features Matching SolidJS

| Feature | solid-ml-server | SolidJS | Notes |
|---------|----------|---------|-------|
| Signal equality | Physical (`!=`) | Reference (`===`) | Matches - both skip updates for same reference |
| Memo equality | Structural (`=`) | Reference (`===`) | solid-ml-server uses structural by default (customizable) |
| createSelector | `create_selector` | `createSelector` | Returns `(k -> bool)` with auto-cleanup |
| Effect.on | `Effect.on` | `on()` | Explicit deps, untracked body, `~defer` option |
| catchError | `Owner.catch_error` | `catchError` | Sync error handling (no setter reset) |
| Batch | `Batch.run` | `batch` | Groups updates, defers effects |
| Context | `Context.create/provide/use` | `createContext/useContext` | Owner-tree based lookup |
| Suspense | `Suspense.boundary` | `<Suspense>` | Counter-based, shows fallback while loading |
| ErrorBoundary | `ErrorBoundary.make` | `<ErrorBoundary>` | Catches errors with reset capability |
| createUniqueId | `Unique_id.create` | `createUniqueId` | SSR-safe unique ID generation |

### Features NOT Implemented (Intentionally Omitted)

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| `createResource` | Use `Resource` module in router for async data |
| `createDeferred` | No microtask scheduling in OCaml |
| `createReaction` | Use `Effect.on` for explicit tracking |
| `createRenderEffect` | Effects run synchronously already |
| Transitions API | Requires concurrent rendering not available in OCaml |
| `startTransition` | No concurrent mode |
| `useTransition` | No concurrent mode |
| `SuspenseList` | Experimental in SolidJS, doesn't fully support SSR |
| `children` helper | Use direct children access |
| `lazy` | Use OCaml's native `lazy` |
| Event delegation | Implemented globally (matches SolidJS behavior) |

### Semantic Differences

1. **Effect scheduling**: solid-ml-server effects run synchronously during `run_updates`. SolidJS sometimes defers to microtasks. This rarely matters in practice.

2. **Error boundaries**: `Owner.catch_error` catches synchronously thrown exceptions. SolidJS's `catchError` provides a setter to reset; solid-ml-server returns the fallback value directly since OCaml exceptions are sync.

3. **Context ID generation**: Not thread-safe (uses `ref`, not `Atomic`). Create contexts at module init time before spawning domains.

4. **No JSX compiler**: solid-ml-server requires manual DOM/HTML construction or use of MLX syntax. There's no Babel-like transform.

5. **Memo evaluation**: solid-ml-server memos are eager (computed immediately on creation). SolidJS memos are also eager but may defer in some cases.

### Browser-specific Notes

- `create_selector` auto-cleans up when the owning computation is disposed (via `Owner.on_cleanup`)
- No manual `unsubscribe` needed (unlike earlier versions)
- Multiple apps on same page share the global runtime ref
