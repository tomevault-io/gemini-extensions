# Agent Guide

## Scope
- `projmux` is a standalone tmux session-management application.
- Keep portable session-management behavior in `projmux`.
- Keep machine-local policy outside the application unless the migration plan explicitly calls for it.
- Keep `AGENTS.md` focused on repo contract. Personal agent recipes, reverse-engineering notes, and machine-local operating memos belong in external local docs (Obsidian/dotfiles anchors), not this tracked file.
- Local-only agent overlays may live in an untracked `AGENTS.local.md` anchored via dotfiles. This tracked file stays shareable and tool-agnostic.

## Startup Checks
- Confirm you are in the intended checkout/worktree with `pwd`.
- Check local state with `git status --short`.

## Branch And Checkout Rules
- Use one branch per task. Preferred names: `feat/<topic>`, `fix/<topic>`, `docs/<topic>`, `refactor/<topic>`, `chore/<topic>`.
- Use a dedicated checkout/worktree per task when parallel work would otherwise collide.
- Keep one agent per checkout/worktree. Do not share a dirty checkout across agents.
- If another agent owns a file, do not overwrite their changes. Adjust around them or coordinate a handoff.
- Keep changes narrow. Split docs, bootstrap, migration, and feature work into separate branches unless they are inseparable.

## Branch Protection And PR Flow
- `main` is protected by the repository ruleset `main-protect`. Direct pushes to `main` are blocked even for repository admins.
- Every change ships through a pull request. The required status check is the CI `Test` job.
- Admin bypass mode is `pull_request`: the admin can self-merge a PR without approvals, but the PR itself is mandatory.
- Default merge method is **squash**. The PR title becomes the squash commit subject and is what release-please parses, so write it as a Conventional Commit. Follow [docs/pr-guideline.md](docs/pr-guideline.md) for full conventions.
- `make install` cannot run before the PR is merged into `main`. The full team-lead loop is: push branch → open PR → wait for CI → merge → `git pull --ff-only` → `make install`.

## Standard Dev Flow
- Make targets are the contract for local validation. Keep them stable and predictable.
- Run work in this order before opening a PR:
  1. `make fmt`
  2. `make fix`
  3. `make test`
  4. `make test-integration`
  5. `make test-e2e`
- Then push and open the PR:
  6. `git push -u origin <branch>`
  7. `gh pr create --title ... --body ...` (Conventional Commit title; see [docs/pr-guideline.md](docs/pr-guideline.md)).
  8. Wait for the `Test` check to turn green (`gh pr checks <num> --watch`). Use `--auto` on `gh pr merge` if you want it queued.
  9. `gh pr merge <num> --squash --delete-branch`.
- Promote the build only after merge:
  10. `git -C <repo> pull --ff-only`
  11. `make install` — atomic replace of `$(go env GOPATH)/bin/projmux` plus `projmux tmux apply`. **Never run it before step 10**; pre-merge state has not cleared CI yet and may not match what `main` will hold.
  12. Retire the merged checkout/worktree with your local tooling if you used one.
- If a target is missing for the area you are changing, add it or leave the repository in a state where the gap is explicit in docs and review notes.
- If behavior changes, update the maintained test list in [docs/agent-workflow.md](docs/agent-workflow.md) in the same branch.
- Do not skip `fmt` or `fix` because tests passed. Formatting, automatic fixes, and test execution are separate gates.

## Hook Contract Stability
- The post-create hook contract (path `~/.config/projmux/hooks/post-create`, `PROJMUX_*` env vars, 5s timeout) is part of the public API. Adding, removing, or renaming any `PROJMUX_*` env var, or moving the hook path, requires at minimum a minor version bump.

## Release Flow
- `release-please-action` watches `main`, accumulates Conventional Commit subjects, and opens or refreshes a "chore(main): release X.Y.Z" PR. That PR contains the version bump (`internal/version/version.go` + `.release-please-manifest.json`), `CHANGELOG.md` updates, and the release notes.
- Merging the release PR pushes the `vX.Y.Z` tag and creates the GitHub Release with auto-generated notes.
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` triggers on the tag push, builds the linux/darwin × amd64/arm64 matrix, and uploads tarballs to the release that already exists (`gh release upload --clobber`). Do not add hardcoded notes back to that workflow — release-please owns the notes.
- Non-Conventional commit subjects on `main` are silently skipped by release-please. Keep PR titles strict; squash merge ensures the PR title is the only subject that lands.

## Configuration And Environment

Project root and discovery:

- `PROJMUX_PROJDIR` is the canonical project-root env. It accepts an OS-native PATH-style multi-value (`filepath.SplitList`): the first non-empty entry is the primary repo root (memoized to `~/.config/projmux/projdir`), and any additional entries are prepended to managed roots. The legacy `PROJDIR`/`RP` env vars are no longer honored.
- `PROJMUX_MANAGED_ROOTS` is the colon-separated search-root override (priority: env > saved file > defaults). Legacy alias `TMUX_SESSIONIZER_ROOTS` is still honored at runtime.
- `~/.config/projmux/workdirs` stores the cumulative workdirs list managed via the Settings UX. It is read only when no env list is set.
- `tmux set-option -g @projmux_projdir <path>` is a declarative source for `PROJMUX_PROJDIR` that the switch command reads through `tmuxProjdirOption`.

Notifications:

- `PROJMUX_NOTIFY_HOOK` — external executable that receives AI desktop notifications instead of the built-in sender. The hook is invoked with positional arguments: summary, body, OS urgency, app name, tag, group, icon path. The urgency argument is the transient OS notification urgency, not the persistent notify-queue severity. When unset, projmux uses `notify-send` on Linux and PowerShell toasts on WSL.
- `PROJMUX_NOTIFY_EXPIRE_MS` — AI desktop notification expiration in milliseconds. Defaults to `5000`; unset, zero, negative, and non-numeric values fall back to the default.
- `PROJMUX_WSL_TOAST_ICON_DIR` — override directory for the icon copied into a Windows-readable path before the WSL toast call.

Usage tracking:

- `PROJMUX_USAGE_STATE_DIR` — override for the snapshot cache directory. Defaults to `<state>/projmux/usage`. Point at a synced location (Dropbox, iCloud Drive) to share authoritative usage between machines. Resolved verbatim, no `~` expansion.
- `PROJMUX_USAGE_DEBUG` — when non-empty, surfaces adapter errors from `projmux status usage` to stderr instead of swallowing them.
- `PROJMUX_USAGE_LIMITS_PATH` — deprecated. v2 takes limits straight from the upstream APIs; the variable is read but ignored.

Focus:

- `PROJMUX_FOCUS_DEBUG` — when non-empty, `projmux focus` prints a one-line telemetry record (target/session/window/pane/socket/source/kind) to stderr.

Hook contract environment (passed to `~/.config/projmux/hooks/post-create`):

- `PROJMUX_SESSION` — session name being created.
- `PROJMUX_CWD` — absolute path of the project directory.
- `PROJMUX_SESSION_KIND` — `persistent` or `ephemeral`.
- `PROJMUX_SOCKET` — tmux socket path when projmux is running on a non-default `-L` socket; absent on the default socket.
- `PROJMUX_VERSION` — the binary's `internal/version` string.

Tunables (rarely touched):

- `PROJMUX_TMUX_NOTIFY_DEDUPE_SECONDS` — top-level override for the AI desktop notification dedupe window; Settings saved value and default are used only when this env is unset or invalid.
- `PROJMUX_CODEX_TITLE_WATCH_INTERVAL`, `PROJMUX_CODEX_REPLY_SETTLE_LOOPS` — pacing knobs for the AI title-watch loop.
- `TMUX_KUBE_CACHE_TTL`, `TMUX_KUBE_TIMEOUT` — knob for the kube status segment cache and the kubectl invocation budget.

## Review Expectations
- Reviews should be small enough to reason about quickly.
- Include the command list you ran, especially the `make` targets and any parity checks.
- Call out behavior changes separately from refactors.
- Flag unverified areas instead of implying coverage you did not run.
- If migration parity is incomplete, state the exact gap and the follow-up branch or issue.

## Migration Discipline
- Port one stable slice at a time. Do not mix bootstrap, feature redesign, and parity fixes in one change without a strong reason.
- Match existing behavior first, then simplify or redesign in a later change.
- When replacing shell logic with Go, keep the user-facing entrypoints stable until the adapter layer is intentionally updated.
- Compare new behavior against the maintained parity tests whenever the migrated feature already has coverage.
- Record intentional behavior differences in docs and review notes.

## Testing Policy
- Unit tests cover pure naming, selection, parsing, and state logic.
- Integration tests cover tmux command orchestration, config loading, and state file interactions.
- End-to-end tests cover full session flows against real tmux behavior.
- When adding a feature, decide where it belongs in that stack and add or update the corresponding test entry.

## Communication
- Use concise progress updates.
- Report blockers early, especially if they involve parity uncertainty or overlap with another agent's files.
- When handing off, state the branch, checkout/worktree path, changed files, and remaining risks.
