# Working with hera-agent-godot (for AI agents)

`hera` (repo: hera-agent-godot) is a low-token CLI that lets you inspect and
control a **live Godot 4.x editor**. Use it to act on the *real* editor and
check the result — don't guess scene structure or whether a change worked from
memory. The binary installs as `hera`; `hera-agent-godot` is a transitional
alias for the same CLI.

## Co-developing this repo (Claude Code × Codex)

Claude Code and Codex collaborate on **developing hera-agent-godot itself**
(the Go CLI, the GDScript addon, docs, and distribution) — this section is
about building the tool, not driving the editor with it. Rules for both
agents:

- The other agent reconstructs context **only from the repo**: git history and
  docs. Make small commits with descriptive English messages; never leave
  meaningful state only in chat.
- State that lives **outside this repo** — Godot Asset Store submissions and
  the Homebrew tap repo ([NotNull92/homebrew-hera](https://github.com/NotNull92/homebrew-hera))
  — must be recorded under `docs/` (release notes in `docs/releases/` or the
  ROADMAP) whenever it changes.
- `main` is shared: never force-push or rewrite pushed history; rebase
  local-only work.
- The same gates apply regardless of agent: `go build/vet/test` + `gofmt`
  for Go; Godot `--check-only` for GDScript; sync README (EN/KO),
  `docs/COMMANDS.md`, and `docs/ROADMAP.md` when the surface changes, and
  regenerate the contract goldens when `docs/CONTRACT.md` behavior changes.
- Outward-facing actions (store uploads, PRs to third-party repos, version
  bumps/releases) need the user's explicit go-ahead; Asset Store form
  submission is done by the user personally.
- Machine-specific facts (Godot binary path, isolated-smoke pattern, toolchain
  limits, external-form gotchas) live in [docs/DEV_MACHINE.md](docs/DEV_MACHINE.md)
  — read it before local Godot smokes, third-party PRs, or publishes, and
  update it there instead of re-discovering.
- **Ported capabilities must be fully naturalized.** When an idea, architecture,
  or workflow is adapted from an outside tool, what ships is a Hera-native
  capability: named for the Godot/Hera construct it operates on, and justified
  from engine behaviour rather than from "the other tool does it this way".
  Leave no external tool name, no "ported from X" framing, no side-by-side
  comparison tables, and no borrowed taxonomy labels anywhere in the repo —
  docs, skills, and code alike. Re-derive each rule from the Godot fact that
  forces it; if a rule cannot be justified that way, it does not belong.
  Attribution cuts the other way for **copied material**: anything actually
  vendored or licensed keeps its upstream provenance and licence, and published
  standards stay cited (as WCAG is in the `ui-theme-qa` corpus). Never strip a
  credit while keeping copied expression — rewrite the expression genuinely
  instead. Prefer deriving values from Godot's own defaults over vendoring
  someone else's data, so the question does not arise.

## Canonical Godot sources for documentation and review

When verifying or reviewing Godot engine behavior, APIs, CLI flags, version
compatibility, or official documentation, consult the maintained upstream
repositories first:

- Godot engine: [github.com/godotengine/godot](https://github.com/godotengine/godot)
- Official Godot documentation: [github.com/godotengine/godot-docs](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-docs)

Local repository documentation remains authoritative for Hera-specific
contracts and policies. Use the upstream sources above to settle Godot facts;
do not substitute stale recollection or unofficial summaries when they apply.

## When to use it

- You need the actual state of the open scene (node tree, a node's properties).
- You want to change the scene (add/set/remove nodes) and confirm it stuck.
- You want to run a scene, then read the log for errors.
- You want an off-screen preview render of the edited scene (`screenshot`) or a
  live game viewport capture (`screenshot --runtime` / `game screenshot`).

If the user is not running the Godot editor with the **Hera Agent** plugin
enabled, commands fail with "no live Godot editor found" — ask them to enable it.

## Setup (once)

1. Open the project in a **Godot 4.x** editor.
2. Enable **Project → Project Settings → Plugins → Hera Agent Godot**. The Output
   panel should show `[hera] ... listening on 127.0.0.1:<port>`.
3. Get the CLI: install a release binary (see the README's Install section) or
   build from source with `go build -o hera .` (from the repo root).

The CLI finds the editor automatically via `~/.hera-agent-godot/instances/`.

```

Global flags go **before** the command: `--json` (pretty-print), `--ids` (print
only node paths, for `scene tree` / `node find`), `--instance <pid>` (explicitly
target a pid shown by `status`), `--timeout <ms>` (per-request HTTP timeout,
default 5000). Default output is compact JSON.

## Conventions & safety

- **Output is compact by default** to stay low-token. Use `--ids` to get just
  node paths when scanning, `--json` only when you need the full structure.
- **UI work reads the live guidance mode first.** Before agent-driven UI work,
  run `hera guidance ui`. If it reports `game_feel_ui_mode: true`, implement
  UI around Game Feel: immediate input feedback, expressive state changes,
  satisfying bounded motion, and runtime visual QA for those effects.
- **Mutations are undoable where Godot exposes editor undo.**
  `node add/instance/set/remove`, `node attach-script/detach-script`, and
  `signal connect/disconnect` register with the editor's undo history, so the
  user can Ctrl+Z those changes.
- **Run one live editor per project.** Hera is designed for a single active
  Godot editor. Mutation-capable commands (`node add/instance/set/remove`,
  `node attach-script/detach-script`, `signal connect/disconnect`,
  `scene open/reload/save/create/save-as`, `editor select/clear-selection`, `script open/create`, `resource set/create`, `project mkdir/scan/reimport`,
  `project set-main-scene`, `eval`, `game node set/call`, `smoke --run-game`,
  and `batch`) enforce that by
  refusing to run when several editors are live unless `--instance <pid>` is
  passed explicitly.
- **`eval` is powerful.** It runs one GDScript expression (not statements) with
  the edited scene root as base, so `get_node("X").something()` works — and can
  have side effects. It is **not** registered with undo. Prefer `node set` for
  property changes.
- **Opt-in token auth.** If commands fail with `unauthorized: ...`, the editor
  requires the shared token; the CLI reads it automatically from
  `HERA_AGENT_GODOT_TOKEN` or `~/.hera-agent-godot/token`
  (see [docs/SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md)).
- **GDScript guide authority, low-token mode.**
  [docs/GDSCRIPT_AGENT_GUIDE.md](docs/GDSCRIPT_AGENT_GUIDE.md) is the
  authoritative source and must be followed, but do not reload the whole guide
  mechanically for routine edits. Use this quick gate first, then open the full
  guide only when the change touches syntax/API not covered here, diagnostics
  fail, the guide changed, or you are uncertain:
  - Do not invent syntax; when uncertain, check the canonical Godot sources
    above or existing code.
  - Use explicit types for function parameters/returns, dynamic API results,
    `Variant`, and untyped `Array`/`Dictionary` reads.
  - Use `:=` only when Godot can infer a concrete non-Variant type.
  - Use GDScript ternaries (`a if condition else b`), never C-style `? :`.
  - Qualify engine constants/enums/flags with their owner, e.g.
    `Control.PRESET_FULL_RECT`.
  - Prefer `and`/`or`/`not`, typed `@onready` or exported node references,
    named signal handlers for normal UI, and `@tool` only when editor-time
    execution is required and guarded.
  - After any GDScript edit, run `godot --headless --path . --check-only` on the
    affected scene or script before calling the work done. If `godot` is not
    available, use Hera diagnostics/run/output as described in the guide.
- **`game node set/call` and `game click` are runtime-only.** They change the running game process,
  is not registered with undo, and is lost when the play session stops.
- **Runtime game requests are process-isolated.** If stale Godot game processes
  are still alive, `game instances` shows them and mutation/read requests refuse
  ambiguous targets instead of accepting an old response.
- **Prefer low-token QA reads.** Use `game ui audit`, `game ui tree`, `game node get --prop/--props`,
  `game assert`, `game qa discover`, `screenshot --runtime --analyze`, and
  `game qa --file` before dumping full node properties during automated QA.
  Runtime screenshot analysis
  reports per-edge content ratios and `possible_clipping` so layouts that only
  fail at the viewport boundary are easier to catch.
- **Tie QA to the user's requirements.** For prompt implementation QA, prefer a
  `game qa --file` object with top-level `requirements` and per-step `covers`
  entries so missing requested behavior fails the scenario instead of being
  buried in prose notes.
- **File, scene, resource, and project setting changes are persistent.** `script create`,
  `resource set/create`, `project mkdir/reimport`, `project set-main-scene`, `scene create`, and
  `scene save-as` write project files; use `--force` only when overwriting is
  intended.
- **Use a single writer for scene files.** Before external `.tscn` edits, stop the
  running game with `hera stop --wait`; after external edits, run
  `hera scene reload [res://Path.tscn]` before saving through the editor.
- **`node set` value** is coerced to the property's type via the engine's own
  `str_to_var`, so pass Godot variant text (the form a `.tscn` stores) for
  complex types: `--value "Vector2(10, 20)"`, `--value "Color(0.3, 0.8, 1, 1)"`,
  and packed arrays as a flat list, e.g.
  `--value "PackedVector2Array(0, 0, 48, 0, 48, 48)"`. A wrong form now fails
  with an example in the error. Object/resource properties are not set this
  way — use `node set-resource <path> --prop <name> --resource res://...`.

## Verify your work (Hera)

After an edit, **confirm it** instead of assuming:

- After `node add`/`set`: `hera node get <path>` and check the value.
- After structural changes: `hera scene tree` (or `--ids`).
- After `run`: `hera output --type error` to catch runtime errors.
- For UI/visual changes: `hera screenshot` for the edited scene, or
  `hera screenshot --runtime` after `run` for the live game viewport.

Batch a change and its check together when it helps, e.g. pipe a JSON array of
`[{set...}, {get...}]` into `hera batch`.
