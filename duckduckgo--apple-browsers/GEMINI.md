# Pull Request Guidelines & Workflow

## 🚨 CRITICAL: Required Information and Approval Before Creating PR

**MANDATORY**: Before creating any PR, you MUST:

### Step 1: Gather Required Information

### 1. Task/Issue URL
**Ask**: "What is the Asana task URL for this PR?"
- **NEVER proceed** with placeholder text like `[TASK_ID]` or `[INSERT_URL]`
- **NEVER assume** you can skip this step
- **ONLY proceed** if user explicitly says to omit it or provides the URL

### 2. PR Reviewer Assignment (CRITICAL for Asana Integration)
**Ask**: "Who should review this PR?"
- Ask if they want to:
  - Assign a specific reviewer (get their GitHub username for `--reviewer` flag)
  - Use auto-assignment (`--reviewer Apple-dev` team)
  - Handle it themselves after PR creation
- **NEVER proceed** without understanding the reviewer assignment strategy
- **ONLY proceed** if user explicitly provides the information or strategy

**WHY THIS MATTERS**: 
- GitHub Action only creates Asana subtask when reviewer is **assigned via GitHub's reviewer mechanism**
- Using `--reviewer` flag triggers the `review_requested` event that runs the Asana integration
- Without reviewer assignment, no Asana subtask is created automatically

### 3. Tech Design URL (For Significant Changes)
- **Default to "N/A"** for minor changes and bug fixes
- **ASK for significant changes** (new features, architectural changes)
- **Can be omitted** if user doesn't explicitly provide one - use "N/A"
- Unlike Task/Issue URL, this is **optional** and can default to "N/A"

### 4. Exception: User Explicitly Opts Out
The **ONLY** acceptable reason to skip asking for Task URL and Reviewer is if the user explicitly states:
- "Skip Asana task" or "No Asana task"
- "I'll assign reviewer myself" or "Use auto-assignment"

**Failure to ask for Task URL and Reviewer = violation of PR workflow.**

---

### Step 2: Get User Approval Before Creating PR

**MANDATORY**: After gathering all information, you MUST:

1. **Present the complete PR body text** to the user for review and approval
2. **Include the reviewer name** that will be assigned
3. **Show the exact text** that will be used in the PR body (not the command)
4. **Wait for explicit approval** before proceeding
5. **ONLY after approval**: Execute the `gh pr create` command

**Do NOT create the PR without showing the user the exact PR body text first.**

**Format for approval request:**
```
Here's the PR I'm about to create:
**Title:** [PR title]

**Reviewer:** @username

**PR Body:**
[Show complete PR body text here]

Proceed with creating the PR?
```

After user approves, then execute the `gh pr create` command.

## 🚨 CRITICAL: Always Open PR URL After Creation

**MANDATORY**: After creating or updating a PR, **IMMEDIATELY** run:
```bash
open <PR_URL>
```

This ensures the PR is accessible and properly formatted in the browser.

## Objective

- **Maintain a clear and maintainable list** of open PRs in the Apple repositories
- **Improve PR review turnaround time** through proper assignment and notification processes
- **Establish clear rules** for internal (Apple team) and external (FrontEnd, etc.) contributions
- **Remove PR assignment** as part of the Apple Weekly process

## PR Types and Assignment Strategy

We have **two different types** of code contributions:

### **Projects**
Large features or significant changes with designated technical reviewers.

### **Tasks** 
Small improvements or bug fixes that require flexible reviewer assignment.

**Key Principle**: A PR **assignee** is the PR author, a PR **reviewer** is whoever will review it.

## Assignment Workflows

### Projects Workflow

For significant features and planned work:

1. **Use Technical Reviewer**: The technical reviewer should be the default person to assign the PR review
2. **No MM Posting**: There's no need to post the PR link on MM (Mattermost)
3. **Review Assignment Process**:
   - Create PR with: `gh pr create --reviewer TECHNICAL_REVIEWER_USERNAME`
   - This automatically creates Asana subtask and assigns it to the reviewer
   - No need to manually ping on Asana (automation handles it)
4. **Shared Responsibility**: Both the technical reviewer and developer are responsible for staying in sync
5. **Fallback**: If the technical reviewer can't review the PR, request different reviewer in GitHub UI (triggers new Asana assignment)

### Tasks Workflow

For bug fixes and small improvements:

1. **Pre-Agreement**: Think about who's the best person to review this task and **agree with them to be the reviewer even before posting the PR** (similar to choosing technical reviewer for projects)

2. **When Uncertain**: If you don't know who would be the best person, or the problem is generic and doesn't require domain knowledge, use **GitHub auto assignment** with `--reviewer Apple-dev`

3. **Assignment Process**:
   - Create PR with: `gh pr create --reviewer USERNAME` (or `--reviewer Apple-dev` for auto)
   - Asana subtask is automatically created and assigned
   - No need to manually ping on Asana (automation notifies them)
   - If reviewer is AFK, request different reviewer in GitHub UI (triggers new assignment)

4. **Availability Management**:
   - Set your GitHub to "away" to prevent auto-selection if unavailable
   - Use your best judgment for availability

5. **Reviewer Flexibility**: If assigned as reviewer but can't review or don't feel comfortable with the area, discuss reassignment with the PR author

## Auto Review Assignment

**Algorithm**: Load balance routing to equally distribute review work

**Process**:
1. Use `gh pr create --reviewer Apple-dev` OR manually select the **"Apple-dev" team** as reviewer in GitHub UI
2. GitHub will automatically assign an individual based on load balancing
3. Asana workflow automatically creates subtask and assigns to the selected reviewer's Asana account

### Assignment on Asana

**AUTOMATED**: When you assign a reviewer on GitHub (via `--reviewer` or UI), the workflow automatically:
- Extracts Asana task ID from PR body
- Creates a "Code Review" subtask in that Asana task
- Assigns the subtask to the GitHub reviewer's Asana account

**Manual steps (if needed):**
- If automation fails or reviewer doesn't match, manually create subtask in Asana
- **Reviewer completes** the code review subtask once review is finished
- **Communication**: Use best judgment to contact PR author via Asana, MM, or PR comments for review feedback

## Draft PRs

**Purpose**: Share in-progress work for early feedback

**Guidelines**:
- Use Draft PRs for work-in-progress sharing
- **Your responsibility**: Don't let drafts stay around for long periods
- **No rigid timeframes**: Use best judgment on when to close drafts
- **Goal**: Keep open PR list as clean as possible

## PR Labels

Use pre-defined labels to classify PR intention/state:

### Current Available Labels

- **`[Hacktoberfest]` & `[hacktoberfest-accepted]`**: For PRs related to Hacktoberfest event
- **`[Pending Product Review]`**: PR is being reviewed in Ship Reviews - **NEVER merge** if this tag is present
- **`[dependencies]`**: Automatically used by Dependabot

**Adding New Labels**: Discuss with the team before creating new labels

## Auto-Merge on Approval

**Feature**: Automatically merge PR after review approval

**Setup Process**:
1. Set PR to auto-merge using GitHub's built-in functionality
2. No specific labels required
3. **Documentation**: [GitHub Auto-merge Guide](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/automatically-merging-a-pull-request)

**Requirement**: At least one green review is required due to branch protection

## Branch Protection

**Requirement**: **At least one green review** is required to merge any PR

## Feature Flags & PR Size Guidelines

### PR Size Best Practices

- **Keep PRs as short as possible** for efficiency and respectful time management
- **Use feature flags** (static or dynamic) so changes can be merged without affecting the final product
- **Smaller PRs = better feedback**: More likely to receive constructive review comments

### When Uncertain

- **Talk with technical reviewer** and/or project advisor about breaking down PRs
- **Use feature flags** to enable gradual rollout and safe merging

## Pull Request Template

**MANDATORY**: When creating Pull Requests, ALWAYS follow this template structure:

```markdown
Task/Issue URL: [MUST ASK USER - Do not proceed with placeholder]
Tech Design URL: [ASK USER for significant changes; can default to N/A if not provided]
CC: [ASK USER for stakeholders; can default to N/A if not provided]

### Description
[Provide a clear and concise description of the changes as a bulleted list. List changes in order of significance - most impactful/critical changes first, implementation details last. Be brief and omit small changes that are not directly related to the core issue being fixed. Format as bullet points without subsection titles]

### Testing Steps
[List detailed manual testing steps only. Do not include "run tests" or similar - CI runs automated tests. Focus on manual verification steps that require human interaction]

### Impact and Risks
**Impact Level: [Assess as High, Medium, Low, or None]**

#### What could go wrong?
[List potential risks and mitigation strategies]

### Quality Considerations
[Include relevant considerations for edge cases, performance, monitoring, documentation, and privacy/security]

### Notes to Reviewer
[Include any specific notes for the reviewer, if applicable]
```

### Template Guidelines

#### Required Information
- **Task/Issue URL**: **MUST ASK USER** - Always obtain the actual Asana task URL, never use placeholders
- **Tech Design URL**: **ASK USER** for significant changes; can be omitted and default to "N/A" if not explicitly provided
- **CC**: **ASK USER** for relevant stakeholders; can default to "N/A" if not explicitly provided
- **Description**: Clear, concise bulleted list of changes in order of significance - most critical/impactful changes first, implementation details last. Be brief and omit small changes not directly related to the core issue. No subsection titles
- **Testing Steps**: Manual testing steps only (CI runs automated tests). Focus on human verification steps
- **Impact Assessment**: Use guidelines below
- **Risk Analysis**: Potential issues and mitigation strategies
- **Quality Considerations**: Edge cases, performance, monitoring, documentation, privacy/security

#### Impact Level Assessment

- **High**: Changes affecting user privacy/security, data loss potential, core functionality breaks, billing impacts, significant performance effects
- **Medium**: Feature disruption, user flow changes, significant UI changes, analytics/tracking impacts
- **Low**: Minor bug fixes, small UI adjustments, existing feature improvements, non-critical feature additions
- **None**: Internal tooling, documentation, refactoring without behavior changes, test improvements

#### Quality Considerations Checklist

- **Edge cases** that have been considered
- **Performance impacts** and optimizations made
- **Monitoring and analytics** additions or changes
- **Documentation updates** required
- **Privacy and security** considerations, if applicable

## PR Creation Workflow

**CRITICAL**: After creating or updating a PR, **ALWAYS open the PR URL** in the browser immediately.

### Steps:
1. **Create PR with reviewer assignment**:
   ```bash
   # For specific reviewer
   gh pr create --reviewer USERNAME
   
   # For auto-assignment (Apple-dev team)
   gh pr create --reviewer Apple-dev
   ```
   
2. **Immediately run**: `open <PR_URL>` (the URL returned by gh command)
3. Verify the PR appears correctly in the browser

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Reviewer Assignment Requirement

**The Asana integration ONLY works when reviewers are assigned via GitHub's reviewer mechanism.**

**How it works:**
- GitHub Action `.github/workflows/create_asana_pr_subtask.yml` triggers on `review_requested` event
- Extracts Asana task ID from PR body (looks for `Task/Issue URL: https://app.asana.com/...`)
- Creates subtask in Asana and assigns it to the GitHub reviewer

**This means:**
- ✅ **CORRECT**: `gh pr create --reviewer USERNAME` (triggers Asana assignment)
- ✅ **CORRECT**: Manually request reviewer in GitHub UI (triggers Asana assignment)
- ❌ **WRONG**: Only mentioning reviewer in PR description (does NOT trigger Asana assignment)
- ❌ **WRONG**: Creating PR without `--reviewer` flag (does NOT trigger Asana assignment)

**If you forget to assign reviewer during creation:**
1. Request reviewer manually in GitHub UI
2. This will trigger the workflow and create the Asana subtask

## Review Process Best Practices

### For PR Authors
1. **Pre-review checklist**: Ensure all template sections are complete
2. **Self-review**: Review your own changes before requesting review
3. **Context**: Provide sufficient context for reviewers
4. **Responsive**: Address review comments promptly
5. **Asana updates**: Keep related Asana tasks updated

### For PR Reviewers
1. **Timely reviews**: Prioritize PR reviews to maintain good turnaround time
2. **Thorough but efficient**: Balance thoroughness with review speed
3. **Constructive feedback**: Provide actionable suggestions
4. **Asana completion**: Mark code review subtasks as complete
5. **Communication**: Use appropriate channels (Asana, MM, PR comments) for feedback

## Workflow Summary

### For Projects:
1. Technical reviewer assigned by default
2. Ready for review → **Use `gh pr create --reviewer USERNAME`** → Asana subtask auto-created
3. No MM posting required (Asana handles it)
4. **Open PR URL in browser**

### For Tasks:
1. Pre-agree on reviewer OR use auto-assignment
2. **Use `gh pr create --reviewer USERNAME`** or `--reviewer Apple-dev` for auto-assignment
3. Asana subtask is automatically created and assigned to reviewer
4. Handle AFK reviewers by requesting different reviewer in GitHub (triggers new Asana assignment)
5. **Open PR URL in browser**

### For All PRs:
1. **CRITICAL**: Use `--reviewer` flag when creating PR (enables Asana integration)
2. Include valid Asana task URL in PR body (required for automation)
3. Use feature flags for safe merging
4. Keep PRs small and focused
5. Apply appropriate labels
6. Set auto-merge if desired
7. Follow template requirements
8. Maintain clean draft PR list
9. **ALWAYS open PR URL after creation/update**
