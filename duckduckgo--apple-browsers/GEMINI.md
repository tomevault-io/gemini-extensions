# DuckDuckGo Browser Development Rules Overview

## Project Context
This is the DuckDuckGo browser for iOS and macOS, built with privacy-first principles, modern Swift patterns, and cross-platform architecture.

**Key Directories:**
- `iOS/` - iOS browser app (UIKit + SwiftUI hybrid)
- `macOS/` - macOS browser app (AppKit + SwiftUI hybrid) 
- `SharedPackages/` - Cross-platform Swift packages

## Architecture Summary
- **Pattern**: MVVM + Coordinators + Dependency Injection
- **UI**: SwiftUI preferred, UIKit/AppKit for legacy
- **Storage**: Core Data + GRDB + Keychain for sensitive data
- **Design**: DesignResourcesKit for colors/icons (MANDATORY)
- **Testing**: >80% coverage required

## Available Rules (`.cursor/rules/`)

Development rules are stored in `.cursor/rules/`.
You MUST list all the available rules and you MUST consult the appropriate rule file before starting any work!

### Core (Always Apply)
- `anti-patterns.mdc` - What NOT to do; use with ViewModels, testing, WebView work
- `code-style.mdc` - Swift style guide
- `privacy-security.mdc` - Privacy requirements; use with network calls, analytics, credentials
- `import-hygiene.mdc` - Import management and SwiftUI preview scoping
- `logging-guidelines.mdc` - Logger usage (never print())

### Architecture & Patterns
- `architecture.mdc` - MVVM, DI patterns; use for new ViewModels
- `project-structure.mdc` - Directory layout
- `browserserviceskit-integration.mdc` - BSK integration; use for cross-platform code
- `shared-packages.mdc` - Cross-platform packages; use for cross-platform code
- `subscription-architecture.mdc` - Privacy Pro subscription

### Feature Development
- `feature-flags.mdc` + `feature-flags-addition.mdc` - Feature flags
- `abn-experiment-framework.mdc` - A/B testing
- `user-defaults-storage.mdc` - UserDefaults, @UserDefaultsWrapper; use for settings/preferences

### UI Development
- `swiftui-style.mdc` - SwiftUI + DesignResourcesKit; use for new ViewModels, UI work
- `swiftui-advanced.mdc` - Advanced SwiftUI patterns
- `design-system-designresourceskit.mdc` - Colors, typography, icons (MANDATORY)
- `webkit-browser.mdc` - WebView patterns

### Platform-Specific
- `ios-architecture.mdc` - iOS AppDependencyProvider, MainCoordinator, UIKit
- `ios-tracker-blocking-implementation.mdc` - iOS content blocking
- `macos-window-management.mdc` - macOS windows
- `macos-system-integration.mdc` - macOS system services
- `macos-singletons-removal.mdc` - Removing singletons from macOS

### Feature-Specific
- `duckplayer.mdc` + `duckplayer-userscript-integration.mdc` - DuckPlayer
- `securevault-guidelines.mdc` - Credentials/vault storage
- `app-lifecycle-state-machine.mdc` - App state management
- `network-quality-*.mdc` (4 files) - Network quality assessment

### Testing & Quality
- `testing.mdc` - Testing patterns, xcodebuild commands
- `ui-testing.mdc` - UI testing for macOS browser
- `maestro-device-selection.mdc` - Maestro test device config
- `performance-optimization.mdc` - Performance; use with network calls

### Workflow & Process
- `development-commands.mdc` - Build commands
- `pull-request.mdc` + `branch-naming-conventions.mdc` - PRs and git workflow
- `analytics-patterns.mdc` - Pixel analytics

## Quick Start Checklist

### Before Writing Any Code:
1. ✅ Read `privacy-security.mdc` - Privacy is non-negotiable
2. ✅ Check platform rules (`ios-architecture.mdc` or `macos-system-integration.mdc`)
3. ✅ Review `anti-patterns.mdc` - Avoid common mistakes
4. ✅ REMEMBER: NEVER commit, push, or run tests without explicit user permission or unless explicitly asked to

### For UI Development:
1. ✅ Use `swiftui-style.mdc` for SwiftUI components
2. ✅ MUST use DesignResourcesKit colors: `Color(designSystemColor: .textPrimary)`
3. ✅ MUST use DesignResourcesKit icons: `DesignSystemImages.Glyphs.Size16.add`

### For New Features:
1. ✅ Follow `architecture.mdc` for MVVM + DI patterns
2. ✅ Use AppDependencyProvider (iOS) or equivalent (macOS)
3. ✅ Write tests per `testing.mdc` requirements

## Critical Don'ts (from anti-patterns.mdc)
- ❌ NEVER commit, push changes, create or delete branches on git or trigger github actions without EXPLICIT user permission
- ❌ NEVER run tests without EXPLICIT user permission or if user explicitly asked to in their prompt
- ❌ NEVER use `.shared` singletons - use dependency injection instead
- ❌ NEVER hardcode colors/icons (use DesignResourcesKit)
- ❌ NEVER update UI without @MainActor
- ❌ NEVER ignore privacy implications
- ❌ NEVER force unwrap without justification
- ❌ NEVER use `print()` statements - use appropriate Logger extensions instead

## Logging Guidelines

**NEVER use `print()` in production code. ALWAYS use appropriate Logger extensions:**

**Example:** See [logging-guidelines.swift](general/logging-guidelines.swift)

**Available Logger categories:**
- `Logger.general` - General app functionality
- `Logger.network` - Network requests and responses  
- `Logger.ui` - UI updates and user interactions
- `Logger.tests` - Test-specific logging (import `os.log` in tests)

**Benefits of Logger extensions:**
- Structured logging with categories and levels
- Better performance than print() statements
- Automatic log collection and filtering
- Integration with system logging infrastructure

## Dependency Injection Pattern (iOS)
**Example:** See [dependency-injection-pattern.swift](general/dependency-injection-pattern.swift)

## Design System Usage (MANDATORY)
**Example:** See [design-system-usage.swift](general/design-system-usage.swift)

## Code Review Checklist
1. Privacy implications assessed (`privacy-security.mdc`)
2. Design system properly used (`design-system-designresourceskit.mdc`)
3. Architecture patterns followed (platform-specific rules)
4. Anti-patterns avoided (`anti-patterns.mdc`)
5. Tests written and passing (`testing.mdc`)
6. Performance considered (`performance-optimization.mdc`)
7. PR template followed (`pull-request.mdc`)

## Git & Testing Workflow Rules

### 🚨 MANDATORY: Never Auto-Execute Commands
**NEVER commit, push, or run tests without EXPLICIT user permission.**

#### Git Workflow:
1. Make file changes as requested
2. **STOP** before any `git add`, `git commit`, or `git push` commands  
3. **ASK** the user: "Should I commit/push these changes?"
4. **WAIT** for explicit permission (e.g., "yes", "commit it", "push it", "go ahead")
5. Only then execute git commands

#### Testing Workflow:
1. Write or modify code as requested
2. **STOP** before running any tests (`swift test`, `npm test`, `xcodebuild test`, etc.)
3. **ASK** the user: "Should I run the tests?"
4. **WAIT** for explicit permission (e.g., "yes", "run tests", "test it")
5. Only then execute test commands

#### What NOT to Do:
**Example:** See [git-workflow-wrong.sh](general/git-workflow-wrong.sh)

#### What TO Do:
**Example:** See [git-workflow-correct.sh](general/git-workflow-correct.sh)

**These rules have NO exceptions. Always ask before executing git or test commands.**

## Communication Style

- Keep responses concise and focused on the task
- Avoid enthusiastic language like "Perfect!", "You are absolutely right!", "Excellent!"
- Keep work summaries brief - focus on what was changed, not how great it is
- Let the code quality speak for itself rather than using excessive praise

This overview ensures you understand the project context and know which specific rules to consult for your development task.
