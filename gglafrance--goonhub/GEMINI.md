You tend to converge toward generic, flat dashboard designs. For this task, you must avoid the "corporate SaaS" look. Instead, target a **Cinematic, Immersive Media Aesthetic**. The goal is a high-contrast, deep-dark interface that feels sleek, modern, and entertainment-focused.

Focus on:

- **Color & Theme:** Commit to an **OLED-friendly dark mode**. Use absolute black (`#000000`) or deep charcoal (`#0F0F0F`) for backgrounds to make content pop. Use **Neon Accents** for high-priority actions: Electric Green (like `#2ECC71` or neon lime) for toggles/progress and Hot Red (like `#FF4757`) for primary "Subscribe" or "Live" buttons. High contrast is non-negotiable.
- **Surfaces & Glassmorphism:** Create depth using transparency and blur rather than borders. Implement **frosted glass effects** (`backdrop-filter: blur()`) for floating elements like modals, toasts, or upload status cards. These elements should feel like they are hovering above the content with subtle, dark drop shadows.
- **Typography:** Choose clean, **Geometric Sans-Serif** fonts (like circular variants or wide grotesques) that remain legible against dark backgrounds. Use heavy weights for headings and distinct colors (light gray vs. white) to establish hierarchy between titles and metadata (views, dates).
- **Geometry & Layout:** Soften the UI with **generous border-radius**. Video containers, buttons, and floating cards should have rounded corners (12px to 24px). The layout should be spacious, allowing the media thumbnails to dominate the visual hierarchy without clutter.

Avoid generic design choices:

- Low-contrast gray backgrounds (aim for deep darks instead).
- Boxy, sharp-edged containers (default to rounded).
- Heavy use of borders (use background distinctness and spacing instead).
- Standard "Bootstrap" blue primary buttons (use unique neon accents).

Interpret creatively: This is a media consumption and creation interface. It needs to feel "premium" and "app-like." Prioritize the visual impact of the video content and the "Uploading" micro-interaction state shown in the reference.

# Project Context: GoonHub

## 1. Project Overview

**GoonHub** is a high-performance, self-hosted web application designed to organize, view, and manage local NSFW video libraries. Ideally, it functions as a "single-binary" application where the frontend is embedded into the backend.

**Core Philosophy:**

- **Privacy First:** No telemetry, local-only storage, panic buttons.
- **Performance:** Capable of handling 10,000+ files with instant search.
- **User Experience:** Netflix-like UI with advanced filtering and VR support.

---

## 2. Technology Stack

### Backend (The Host)

- **Language:** Go (Golang) 1.21+
- **Web Framework:** Gin.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL 18 using **GORM** (ORM).
- **Video Processing:** FFmpeg (via `u2takey/ffmpeg-go` wrapper).
- **Image Processing:** `disintegration/imaging` for thumbnails.
- **Filesystem:** `fsnotify` for watching folder changes.

### Frontend (The UI)

- **Framework:** Vue.js 3 with Nuxt 3 (Composition API, `<script setup>`).
- **Build Tool:** Vite (SPA mode).
- **Language:** TypeScript.
- **State Management:** Pinia.
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS.
- **Video Player:** Plyr.

### Deployment & Distribution

- **Strategy:** "Bake" the compiled frontend `dist` folder into the Go binary using `//go:embed`.
- **Dev Mode:** Frontend runs on port 3000 (proxying API), Backend on port 8080.
- **Prod Mode:** Single binary runs on port 8080.

## 4. Database Schema (Draft)

The AI agent should use these relationships when generating models.

- **Video:** `ID, Path, Title, Hash (MD5/pHash), Duration, Size, Rating, ViewCount, CreatedAt`
    - _HasMany_ Tags, Performers
    - _BelongsTo_ Studio
- **Performer:** `ID, Name, Bio, Birthdate, Gender, ImageURL`
    - _HasMany_ Videos
- **Studio:** `ID, Name, ParentStudioID`
    - _HasMany_ Videos
- **Tag:** `ID, Name, Category` (e.g., Category="Location", Name="Pool")
    - _ManyToMany_ Videos

---

## 5. Key Features & Implementation Details

### A. Core Infrastructure (Implemented)

- **Configuration:** Viper-based configuration supporting `config.yaml` and Environment Variables (`GOONHUB_...`).
- **Logging:** Structured logging using Zap.
- **Dependency Injection:** Google Wire for compile-time dependency injection.
- **Graceful Shutdown:** Proper signal handling to ensure active requests complete.
- **Middleware:** Request ID, Recovery, CORS, and Structured Logging middleware.

### B. Library Management

- **File Watcher:** The backend must listen to file system events. When a file is added, trigger a `ScanJob`.
- **Hashing:** Calculate hashes to detect duplicates and for metadata scraping lookups.

### C. Video Player

- **Streaming:** Implement HTTP Range requests in Go to allow seeking.
- **Transcoding:** Check `User-Agent`. If the device doesn't support the codec (e.g., HEVC on old browsers), trigger on-the-fly FFmpeg transcoding.
- **Sprite Sheets:** Generate VTT sprite sheets for timeline hovering.

### D. Privacy & Security

- **Auth:** JWT-based stateless authentication.

### E. Metadata Scraping

- **Scrapers:** Implement modular scrapers (interfaces) for sites like ThePornDB.
- **Logic:** Try to match by Hash first, then by Filename regex.

## 6. Coding Rules for the Agent

1.  **Go Error Handling:** NEVER ignore errors. Use `if err != nil`. Wrap errors with context (e.g., `fmt.Errorf("failed to scan file: %w", err)`).
2.  **Concurrency:** Use `sync.WaitGroup` and Channels for the scanner and transcoder. Do not spawn unlimited goroutines; use a Worker Pool pattern.
3.  **Frontend/Backend Contract:**
    - All API responses must be JSON.
    - Use snake_case for JSON keys (`{"video_id": 1}`) and PascalCase for Go Structs (`VideoID int`).
4.  **Dependency Injection:** Always use Constructor Injection. Do not use global state. Register new components in `internal/wire/wire.go`.
5.  **Configuration:** Do not hardcode values. Add them to `internal/config` structs.
6.  **Code Blocks:** Always provide the filename at the top of the code block.

---

## 7. Development Workflow (How to run)

To start the project, the agent should assume:

1.  **Backend (Dev):** `air` (Hot Reload) or `go run cmd/server/main.go`
2.  **Frontend:** `cd web && bun run dev`
3.  **Build:** `go build -o goonhub ./cmd/server`
4.  **DI Generation:** `go run github.com/google/wire/cmd/wire ./internal/wire` (Run this after changing dependencies)

---

## 8. Prohibited Actions

- Do not delete any data without explicit confirmation.
- Do not use any emojis in log messages or code comments.
