> handles the same mutation having different approved drugs by tumour type (BRAF V600E

# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

OpenOncology ranks cancer drugs against a patient's mutation profile. A VCF goes in;
a ranked list of approved drugs, repurposing candidates, or a custom-discovery brief
comes out. Three parts: a FastAPI backend (`api/`), a Next.js 14 frontend (`web/`),
and a Nextflow genomics pipeline (`pipeline/`). Celery workers chain
`genomic_worker` to `ai_worker` to `notify_worker`; Postgres, Redis, and MinIO back them.

The output is clinical evidence, so the ranking path is treated as scientific code
rather than application code. That distinction drives most of the rules below.

## Commands

`make help` lists the task runner. Targets are POSIX-sh friendly and this project is
developed on Git Bash under Windows.

```bash
make test              # backend + frontend unit + E2E
make test-backend      # both pytest suites with the coverage gate
make test-frontend     # Vitest
make test-e2e          # Playwright (boots the app in demo mode)
make lint              # ruff + eslint + tsc
```

Running services locally:

```bash
cd api && uvicorn main:app --reload     # API on :8000, docs at /docs
cd web && npm run dev                    # frontend on :3000
docker-compose up --build                # full stack
```

### The two pytest suites are not one suite

Both the top-level `ai/` package and the app's `api/ai/` package claim the import
name `ai`. One interpreter can bind that name to exactly one of them, so the suites
run as **separate pytest invocations** and coverage is stitched together with
`--cov-append`:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. pytest api/tests/    # FastAPI app + services (49 modules)
PYTHONPATH=. pytest ai/tests/     # top-level ai/ package
```

Always run from the repo root with `PYTHONPATH=.` and an explicit path.
`pyproject.toml` sets `testpaths = ["api/tests"]` so a bare `pytest` can never drag
both `ai` packages into one process, and `--import-mode=importlib` sits in `addopts`
because collecting `ai/tests/*` fails without it.

Single test: `PYTHONPATH=. pytest api/tests/test_ranking.py::test_name -v`

### Coverage gate

**52**, declared once in `pyproject.toml` under `[tool.coverage.report] fail_under`.
`Makefile` and `.github/workflows/ci.yml` inherit it by omitting `--cov-fail-under` on
the ai-suite invocation. The api-suite invocation passes an explicit
`--cov-fail-under=0`, because coverage is only complete after the second run appends
to it.

Do not put the number back on a command line. It lived in two files before, drifted to
62 against 63, and a local `make test-backend` passed what CI rejected.
`api/tests/test_coverage_threshold_consistency.py` now fails the build if the README
badge, the `CONTRIBUTING.md` prose, or a `--cov-fail-under` literal disagrees with the
config.

The threshold dropped from 69 to 52 when `*/tests/*` was omitted from coverage: a test
module is ~100% covered by the act of running it, and 34 of them were inflating the
headline. Coverage did not regress. The comment in `pyproject.toml` still cites 53.93%
over 8,353 statements; the suite has grown since and now measures about 61% over
8,798, so the gate has more slack than that comment implies.

One trap this creates. Any `pytest --cov=...` run inherits the gate unless it opts
out, so running a single suite alone measures only that suite: `pytest ai/tests/
--cov=ai --cov=api` reports about 14% and exits non-zero with all 42 tests passing.
Add `--cov-fail-under=0`, or drop `--cov`, when you only want to know if tests pass.

### Import paths

Backend modules import as if `api/` were the root: `from database import get_db`, not
`from api.database import ...`. That is how it runs in production (`api/` on
sys.path), and `api/tests/conftest.py` reproduces it with a `sys.path.insert`. Scripts
under `scripts/` put both the repo root and `api/` on the path, so they use
`from api.services.benchmark import ...` instead.

## Protected paths, read before editing

A `PreToolUse` hook (`.claude/hooks/guard_protected.py`, patterns in
`.claude/protected-paths.json`) hard-blocks writes to the ranking and validation
pipeline: `api/ai/**`, `api/services/benchmark.py`, `scripts/**`, `data/**`,
`validation_results/**`, `test-fixtures/**`, `artifacts/**`, the benchmark JSON files,
the ranking test modules, and `PAPER.md`.

The hook is code, not advice. It exists because this repo's four real defects, a
deduplication bug in the holdout sampler, leakage between tuning and evaluation sets,
a live CIViC call during evaluation, and set-iteration order changing output, all
passed the test suite. An agent optimizing for green tests reproduces that class of
bug, and the reported Hit@3 and MRR move without anyone noticing.

If the hook fires: record the proposed change in `BACKLOG.md` under
`## Needs human decision` and move on to other work. Do not route around it with Bash,
sed, a script, or a copy. Routing around it is worse than not making the change.
Humans edit these files in an interactive session with `OO_GUARD_OFF=1`.

Know its one hole before relying on it. The hook derives the repo root from where the
script itself lives, and `relative()` returns `None` for any path outside that root,
which `main()` treats as allow. A protected file reached through a git worktree, a
second clone, or an agent running with `isolation: "worktree"` is therefore not
guarded: the same `api/ai/ranking.py` exits 2 inside the checkout and 0 outside it.
`.claude/` is also untracked, so a fresh clone carries no hook at all. Work in the
primary checkout when touching anything the guard covers.

## Quality gates that block CI

- **Hard clinical benchmark** (`scripts/hard_benchmark_gate.py`). Locked primary
  metric is standard P@3 at 0.65 or better, with Hit@3 at 0.90 or better and zero
  false positives. Never lower a threshold to make it pass.
- **Migration chain** (`scripts/check_migration_chain.py`). One head, one root, no
  duplicate revision ids, no dangling `down_revision`. A fork breaks
  `alembic upgrade head` for every deployment and looks clean in review.
- **`alembic check`**, no uncommitted model changes.
- ESLint at `--max-warnings 0` and `tsc --noEmit`.

Tests must be hermetic. Service tests mock the HTTP layer; OncoKB, OpenTargets,
ChEMBL, and cBioPortal are never called from the default CI path. The slower
live-API benchmark suite is deliberately off the PR path.

## Ranking architecture

`api/ai/ranking.py` holds the logic and `api/ai/ranking_config.py` holds every tunable
number: weights, thresholds, boosts. No magic numbers in the logic file. This split is
what makes ablation studies possible (`scripts/run_ablation.py` swaps in a config with
one source zeroed) and it should be preserved. `EvidenceWeights` must sum to 1.0; call
`RankingConfig.validate()` on any custom instance. When a source is missing its weight
is redistributed proportionally, so a nominal weight is an intent, not a guarantee.

`rank_candidates()` computes a weighted composite, then applies post-hoc rules in
order: resistance gate (EGFR T790M blocks erlotinib, which never ranks positively),
source-diversity penalty, co-mutation penalties, clinical priority boost, tie
annotation. Read `docs/METHODS.md` before touching any of it.

Evidence lookup is `_LEVEL_TABLE` in `api/services/oncokb_evidence.py`, a dict keyed
by `(gene_upper, normalised_alteration)` mapping to `{drug: oncokb_level}`.
`_normalise_alteration()` strips `p.`, converts 3-letter amino acid codes to 1-letter,
strips separators, and consults `_ALTERATION_ALIASES`. `_CANCER_CONTEXT_OVERRIDES`
handles the same mutation having different approved drugs by tumour type (BRAF V600E
in melanoma vs CRC vs NSCLC). Unmatched variants fall through direct lookup, then
fuzzy substring, then gene-level, then `{}`, and an empty result escalates to
Tier 2/3.

Adding an evidence entry means updating `_LEVEL_TABLE`, adding the benchmark case, and
confirming the gate still passes; the full recipe is in `CONTRIBUTING.md`. OncoKB
LEVEL_1/2 map to tier `fda_approved`, LEVEL_3A/3B/4 to `repurposed`, R1/R2 block the
drug. Withdrawn drugs (mobocertinib) must not be added.

Without `ONCOKB_API_TOKEN` the system uses the curated static table rather than the
live API, which is a supported mode, not a degraded one.

## Frontend

Next.js 14 App Router. `web/lib/api.ts` is the typed client; `web/lib/demo-data.ts`
carries the KRAS G12C demo case.

Demo mode (`NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_DEMO_AUTH=1`) bypasses Keycloak and serves that demo
case from local data, so Playwright E2E needs no backend, database, or auth server.
The Playwright config builds and serves a production bundle on :3100 because
`next dev` boots less deterministically in CI.

## Autonomous work

`BACKLOG.md` is git-tracked project state. Read it at session start and update it at
session end, so work survives compaction and restarts. `/groom "<objective>"` fills
it, `/next` takes the top `## Ready` entry through implementer, validator, reviewer,
and PR, and `/standup` reports status. Subagent definitions live in `.claude/agents/`.

`loop.ps1` is meant to run `/next` headlessly until the backlog drains, but it invokes
`claude -p` without `--permission-mode`. In print mode nothing can approve a tool call,
so the first one that needs approval blocks instead of failing: one run sat 22 minutes
on 18 seconds of CPU, having finished the implementer and stalled the moment the
validator reached for Bash. A hung iteration is indistinguishable from a slow one from
outside. Run `/next` interactively, or pass a permission mode deliberately.

Suitable for unattended work: frontend, docs, CI, type coverage, error handling, dead
code, dependency hygiene. Not suitable: anything reachable from the ranking path,
holdout composition, metric reporting, or the claims in the preprint. Those are
`Risk: scientific` and stay in `## Needs human decision`.

**Merging is never automated.** Never open stacked PRs here; twice a child PR merged
into an orphaned branch and the work vanished. Branch from `main`.

## Style

Code without comments unless the surrounding file comments. Complete blocks, not
fragments. Match the style already in the file.
