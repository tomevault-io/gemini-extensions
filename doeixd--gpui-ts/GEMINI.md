# AGENTS.md: A Developer's Guide for AI Agents

**Project:** GPUI-TS
**Purpose:** This document provides AI agents with a comprehensive technical overview of the GPUI-TS project. Its goal is to enable you to understand the architecture, APIs, and contribution guidelines, allowing you to safely and effectively read, modify, and extend the codebase.

## 1. Project Overview & Core Philosophy

**GPUI-TS is a type-safe, schema-driven state management library for web applications.**

Its primary goal is to provide maximum **predictability** and **developer ergonomics** for managing complex state. It achieves this through three core architectural principles:

1.  **Centralized State Ownership:** All application state is defined in a single, unified `AppSchema`. There is one global source of truth, managed by a central `ModelRegistry`. This eliminates state scattered across components.
2.  **Explicit, Atomic Updates:** State is never mutated directly. All modifications are made through explicit functions (e.g., `model.update()`). These updates are designed to be transactional; if they fail, the state should remain consistent.
3.  **Queued Effect System:** State changes do not immediately trigger UI re-renders or other side effects. Instead, they queue "effects" (like notifications or events) which are flushed in a predictable, run-to-completion cycle. This prevents race conditions and cascading updates.

Your primary directive when working with this codebase is to **uphold these principles.**

## 2. Key Files & Directory Structure

To work within this project, you must understand the role of its key files.

-   **`src/index.ts` (The Core Engine):**
    -   Contains the `ModelRegistry` class, which is the heart of the framework.
    -   Defines the `createApp` and `createModelAPI` factory functions.
    -   Implements all core `ModelAPI` methods (`update`, `read`, `onChange`, `emit`, etc.).
    -   **When to modify:** Only when changing fundamental mechanics of state management, transactions, or the effect queue.

-   **`src/lit.ts` (Rendering Layer):**
    -   The integration layer for the `lit-html` rendering library.
    -   Contains `createView`, `createComponent`, and various UI helpers like `suspense`.
    -   **When to modify:** When changing how state is connected to the DOM or adding new rendering capabilities.

-   **`src/helpers.ts` (Schema Definition):**
    -   Contains the `createSchema()` fluent builder and other utilities for schema composition.
    -   **When to modify:** When adding new capabilities to the schema-building process itself (e.g., new plugin types, new builder methods).

-   **Advanced Features (`src/advanced.ts`, `src/robot.ts`, `src/crdt.ts`):**
    -   These modules contain high-level abstractions like `createResource`, state machine integrations, and CRDTs. They are built on top of the core primitives.
    -   **When to modify:** When enhancing or fixing these specific advanced features.

-   **`src/ergonomic.ts` (Developer Experience):**
    -   Contains the `unctx`-based context API (`createAppWithContext`, `useModel`). This is the preferred API for end-users.
    -   **When to modify:** To add new context-aware hooks.

-   **`test/` (Verification):**
    -   Contains the `vitest` test suite. Every file in `src/` should have a corresponding test file here.
    -   **When to modify:** ALWAYS. Any change to source code must be accompanied by new or updated tests.

-   **`README.md` & `docs/` (User-Facing Documentation):**
    -   These files explain how to use the library. They should be considered the "specification" for the public API.
    -   **When to modify:** When adding, removing, or changing any public-facing API.

## 3. Primary APIs and Usage Patterns

When generating code, you should adhere to these established patterns.

### a. Schema and App Initialization

```typescript
import { createSchema, createApp } from 'gpui-ts';

// Always start by defining a schema.
const AppSchema = createSchema()
  .model('user', { name: '', loggedIn: false })
  .model('todos', { items: [] })
  .build();

// Create the app instance.
const app = createApp(AppSchema);
```

### b. State Access and Mutation

```typescript
// Access a model.
const userModel = app.models.user;

// Read state. This is an immutable clone.
const currentUser = userModel.read();

// Mutate state using the .update() method.
userModel.update((state, ctx) => {
  state.name = 'New Name';
  // Always call ctx.notify() to trigger UI updates.
  ctx.notify();
});

// Use path-based helpers for targeted updates.
userModel.updateAt('name', () => 'Another Name');
```

### c. Subscriptions and Events

```typescript
// Subscribe to state changes.
const unsubscribe = userModel.onChange(newState => {
  console.log('User state changed:', newState);
});

// Emit and listen for typed events.
userModel.onEvent(event => {
  console.log('Event received:', event);
});
userModel.emit({ type: 'USER_LOGIN', timestamp: Date.now() });
```

## 4. Development Workflow & Rules

Follow these steps to ensure contributions are safe and correct.

1.  **Installation:** Run `npm install` to set up the environment.
2.  **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** This is the **most important rule.**
    -   Before fixing a bug, write a failing test in the relevant `test/*.test.ts` file that reproduces the bug.
    -   Before adding a feature, write a new test file or add tests that describe the feature's expected behavior.
3.  **Run Tests:**
    -   Run the full suite: `npm test`
    -   Run a specific file: `npm test -- test/index.test.ts`
4.  **Implement Changes:** Modify the files in `src/` to make the new tests pass. Adhere strictly to the architectural principles.
5.  **Documentation:**
    -   Add JSDoc comments to any new public-facing functions.
    -   If the API changes, update `README.md` and relevant files in `docs/`.
6.  **Build:** Run `npm run build` to ensure the distributable files are generated correctly.

## 5. Agent Contribution Guidelines

### Goals

-   **Enhance Ergonomics:** Add new helper functions that simplify common patterns while maintaining the core principles.
-   **Improve Stability:** Add more robust error handling and increase test coverage for edge cases.
-   **Expand Features:** Introduce new, well-tested primitives (e.g., a router, new async helpers).

### Rules of Engagement

-   **ALWAYS write or update tests.** Your contribution will be evaluated primarily on the quality and completeness of its tests.
-   **MAINTAIN API consistency.** New features should feel like they belong with the existing API.
-   **ENSURE immutability.** The core `ModelRegistry` works with mutable drafts internally for performance, but all public-facing APIs and user code should treat state as immutable.
-   **DOCUMENT new public APIs.** This includes JSDoc and updates to `README.md`.

### What to Avoid (DO NOT)

-   **DO NOT** add logic that mutates state outside of an `update` function's callback.
-   **DO NOT** bypass the queued effect system. Avoid calling listeners or subscribers directly. All side effects should be triggered by the `flushEffects` loop.
-   **DO NOT** use `model.update()` when you need reactive subscriptions to trigger. Use `model.updateAndNotify()` instead to ensure subscribers are notified of state changes.
-   **DO NOT** introduce new, third-party rendering libraries. The focus is on a deep and stable integration with `lit-html`.
-   **DO NOT** break the type system. Avoid using `any` unless absolutely necessary and justified. The goal is maximum type safety.
-   **DO NOT** modify the build configuration (`pridepack.json`, `tsconfig.json`) without a clear and compelling reason.

## When Implementing A New Feature, Try And:
- stay backwards compatible
- add comprehensive doc comments
- add new test/test file for this feature
- document the feature in the api documentation / readme
- make sure the tests pass
- make sure everything type checks
- we want maximum type saftey / inference / ergonomics / dx, dont be scared of advanced features.
- everything exported should have comprehensive doc comments!
- keep files small, and focused on a single responsibility
- **CRITICAL**: When updating models that drive reactive subscriptions (like resources), use `updateAndNotify()` instead of `update()` to ensure subscribers are notified of changes

### After any significant task
- Create a document in the docs/AGENT_SUMMARIES folder
- include the date in the file name YYYY-MM-DD - TASk NAME
- inlcude a full summary of everything you tried, and did, new changes, api, notes, gotchas, lessons learned, wrong paths taken, correct path, key findings, removals, additions, next steps, changelog, etc.

* Also, if you ever need some more information about something, you can always check these summaries *


## Testing
- We use vitest and jsdom
- Try and keep test files focused on spcific features
- Try not to over-mock or over-spy on things.
- Try and work around any issues with the testing enviroment
- If running manually use --run
- dont take shortcuts. put in the work
- if you have any questions feel free to ask.
- when adding new features, add tests to test those features
