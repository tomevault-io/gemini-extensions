# Tempo — Agent Instructions

Tempo is a personal time-tracking single-page app. This file orients any
coding agent (GitHub Copilot, etc.) working in this repository.

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: React 19 + TypeScript + Vite SPA, hosted as an **Azure Static
  Web App**. Deployed from repo root (`app_location: /`, `output_location:
  dist`) — there is no `react-app/` subfolder, everything lives at repo root.
- **Backend**: Azure Functions (Node/TypeScript, managed Functions integrated
  with the Static Web App) in `api/`, providing the `/api/*` routes.
- **Storage**: a single Azure Storage account (`<your-storage-account>`) with two
  blob containers:
  - `state` — one JSON blob (`state/tempo.json`) holding the entire app state
    (`customers[]`, `projects[]`, `entries[]`). Synced via optimistic
    concurrency using the blob's ETag (`If-Match` header on writes; a 412
    response means someone else wrote first — client refetches and re-applies).
  - `attachments` — files attached to time entries (e.g. receipts),
    addressed as `<entryId>/<attachmentId>`. Upload/download use short-lived
    SAS URLs issued by the Functions API so file bytes never pass through the
    Function itself.
- **Auth**: GitHub sign-in via Azure Static Web Apps built-in auth
  (`/.auth/login/github`). Access is restricted to a single invited identity
  assigned the custom `owner` role (via `az staticwebapp users invite`, not
  via the Standard-plan password-protection feature). `staticwebapp.config.json`
  gates **every** route (`/*` and `/api/*`) behind `allowedRoles: ["owner"]`.
  There is intentionally no multi-tenant/multi-user support.
- **CI/CD**: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` builds and deploys on every push
  to `main` (and manages PR preview environments) via
  `Azure/static-web-apps-deploy@v1`. It requires the
  `AZURE_STATIC_WEB_APPS_API_TOKEN` repo secret (the SWA deployment token).

This is a **single-user prototype**. Don't add multi-tenant auth, database
migrations, or backwards-compat data migration logic unless explicitly asked
— simplicity is preferred over generality at this stage.

```

## Feature authoring pattern

Every feature that changes behaviour (not just style) follows this three-step
sequence — **in order**, to keep TypeScript happy throughout:

1. **`src/types.ts`** — add/extend the domain type and the view-model
   interface for the affected component(s). Both sides of the state boundary
   must agree before either compiles cleanly.

2. **`src/hooks/useTempoState.ts`** — implement the business logic and extend
   the view-model builder (`useMemo` block) to populate the new fields. This
   file is the *only* place that reads or mutates domain state; components
   never import from `store.ts` or access raw domain arrays.

3. **The component** (`src/components/*.tsx`) — consume the new view-model
   props. Accept data as props, render it, call callbacks. Done.

Always run `npx tsc -b` after each step and fix errors before moving to the
next. This prevents misleading type errors that look like step-3 bugs but are
actually step-1 omissions.

## Styling conventions

Structural styles (dimensions, flex, colour, typography, spacing) live as
**inline `style` props** (`CSSProperties` objects) in the TSX files and in
`useTempoState.ts`. This is consistent throughout the codebase — do not
introduce CSS modules, styled-components, or Tailwind.

Anything requiring `@media`, `:hover`, `:active`, `transition`, `animation`,
or `z-index` stacking belongs in **`src/index.css`** as a named CSS class.
Components opt in via `className`.

When adding a new page or panel that needs mobile adaptations, add the
corresponding `@media (max-width: 767px)` block to `index.css`. The
breakpoint values match the CSS custom properties:
`--bp-mobile: 767px` / `--bp-tablet: 1023px`.

## Mobile checklist

Before considering any UI task complete, verify:

- Tested at **375px viewport width** (iPhone SE / 14 Mini — the historically broken breakpoint)
- All interactive elements have `min-height: 44px` (touch target minimum)
- No `font-size` smaller than `16px` on `input`/`select`/`textarea` (prevents iOS Safari auto-zoom)
- Full-height containers use `height: 100dvh` (with `100vh` fallback), not bare `100vh`
- Sidebar drawer, FAB, and `isMobile` conditional rendering are all consistent for the affected page
- Table-style list views have a `@media (max-width: 767px)` collapse rule in `index.css`

Run `npm run test:e2e` — the Playwright suite includes viewport tests.

See also: `.github/skills/tempo-mobile-layout/SKILL.md` for the full mobile
contract including CSS class names, FAB rules, and common mistakes.

## Key conventions

- **Domain types live in `src/types.ts`** — keep it in sync with both
  `useTempoState.ts` (state/business logic) and the presentational components
  that consume the resulting view models. Don't duplicate shape definitions.
- **Entry kinds and earnings**: three `Entry.kind` values exist — `'project'`,
  `'service'`, and `'customer'`. The earnings formula for each differs. Always
  use `entryEarnValue()` from `src/lib/earnings.ts` — never duplicate the
  formula inline. `customerId` is `null` on `'project'` entries (reach it via
  `project.customerId`); it is set directly on `'service'` and `'customer'`
  entries.

- **New entries get their `id` assigned immediately** in `openEntry()` (not at
  save time), so attachments can be uploaded to `{entryId}/...` before the
  entry itself is persisted.
- **Sync conflicts** surface as `ConflictError` thrown from `store.saveState()`
  on an HTTP 412; the hook handles this by refetching remote state rather than
  clobbering it.
- **Attachment blob paths** are `{entryId}/{attachmentId}` — no filename in
  the path. Filename/contentType are stored as blob metadata / in the
  `AttachmentRef` record, not encoded in the path.
- **Demo mode** is toggled via `store.getDemoModeFlag()` (a `localStorage`
  boolean). When active, all reads/writes use the `tempo.demo.v1` localStorage
  key and remote sync is fully bypassed. Any code path that reads or modifies
  data must check `current.demoMode` and skip remote I/O, exactly as
  `pushStateNow()` does.

- **Delete cascades**: deleting a customer must also delete its projects and
  all entries referencing those projects or the customer directly. Deleting a
  project or service must also delete its entries. See `deleteCustomerById`,
  `deleteProjectDraft`, and `deleteServiceDraft` in `useTempoState.ts` for the
  pattern.

- **SAS generation** in `api/src/functions/attachments.ts` uses a shared-key
  credential (`TEMPO_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME` / `TEMPO_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_KEY` app
  settings) because **managed Functions in Azure Static Web Apps do not
  support system-assigned managed identity** — only "bring your own Functions"
  does. Don't try to switch this to `DefaultAzureCredential` without first
  moving off managed Functions.
- **Local API dev**: `api/src/auth.ts` supports a `TEMPO_SKIP_AUTH_CHECK=1`
  env var escape hatch, since there's no SWA auth proxy in front of Functions
  during local `func start` / Azurite testing.
- **Timesheet export** (`src/components/ExportView.tsx`, `src/lib/timesheetExport.ts`)
  generates a branded PDF (styled after the IT depends offering documents —
  logo, near-black/gray palette) and a zip of attachments for a customer or
  project + date range, entirely client-side using `pdf-lib` and `jszip`
  (lazy-loaded via `React.lazy` so they don't bloat the main bundle). Entry
  data comes straight from state already in memory; attachment bytes are
  fetched directly from Blob Storage via the existing SAS download URLs. This
  requires **CORS enabled on the storage account's blob service** (GET/HEAD)
  for the app's origins — see the CORS rule note below.

## Build, lint, and test commands

Run all commands from the **repo root** (no subfolder):

- Frontend type-check: `npx tsc -b`
- Frontend build: `npm run build` (runs `tsc -b && vite build`)
- Frontend lint: `npm run lint` (oxlint)
- Frontend unit tests: `npx vitest run`
- E2E tests: `npm run test:e2e` (Playwright)
- API type-check/build: `cd api && npx tsc -p tsconfig.json`
- API install: `cd api && npm install`

Always run the type-check and relevant test suite after changes before
considering a task done.

## Azure resources (for reference, not to be recreated blindly)

- Subscription: set the correct subscription with `az account set --subscription <your-subscription>` before touching these resources with the CLI.
- Resource group: `<your-resource-group>` (e.g. West Europe)
- Storage account: `<your-storage-account>` (Standard_LRS, blob versioning enabled)
  - CORS (blob service): GET/HEAD allowed for your custom domain,
    the default `*.azurestaticapps.net` hostname, and `http://localhost:5173`
    (local Vite dev) — required for client-side attachment zip downloads in
    the timesheet export feature. Update this rule if the app's origins
    change (e.g. new custom domain, different local dev port).
- Static Web App: `<your-swa-resource>` (Free tier), custom domain `<your-custom-domain>`
- Containers: `state`, `attachments`

If you need to change app settings, roles, or redeploy infra, prefer
`az staticwebapp` / `az storage` CLI commands over manual portal changes so
the setup stays reproducible and documented.

## Agent routing

Use the appropriate specialised skill or sub-agent for the following task types:

| Task type | Skill / agent | Notes |
|-----------|--------------|-------|
| Any feature touching `useTempoState.ts`, `types.ts`, earnings, sync | `.github/skills/tempo-state-machine` | 3-file contract; ETag rules; `entryEarnValue()` |
| Any UI / layout / CSS change | `.github/skills/tempo-mobile-layout` | Mobile checklist; FAB rules; breakpoints |
| PDF export, `timesheetExport.ts`, IT depends branding | `.github/skills/tempo-pdf-export` | Brand palette constants; lazy-load rules; CORS |
| Azure CLI operations (storage, SWA, CORS, roles) | `.github/skills/tempo-azure-ops` | **Set `az account set --subscription MVP` first** |
| SWA configuration, deployment, auth setup | `.github/skills/azure-static-web-apps` | General SWA reference (already in repo) |
| Mobile visual verification / screenshots | `agent-browser` skill at 375×812px | Before and after the change |
| Security audit (auth rules, secrets, CORS headers) | `ce-security-sentinel` compound agent | Runs independently; do not modify code |
