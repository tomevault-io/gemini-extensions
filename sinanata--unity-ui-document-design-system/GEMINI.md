## What this project is

A drop-in design system for **Unity 6 UI Toolkit** (UIDocument and PanelRenderer, UXML and USS). It ships design tokens, 42 components, 120 SVG icons, a Google Fonts typography system, a one-class mobile flip, and a small auto-attaching C# runtime. Everything is themed dark and editable from a single stylesheet. Package id: `com.sinanata.designsystem`. License: MIT. The same components render on flat screens and, on Unity 6000.5+, in world space. Both `UIDocument` and `PanelRenderer` can host flat or world-space UI; the showcase uses `PanelRenderer` for its world-space gallery, and Unity now lists `UIDocument` under UI Toolkit > Legacy while keeping it fully supported (not `[Obsolete]`, still world-space capable). Prefer `PanelRenderer` for new work.

## Golden rules (do not violate)

1. **Style with tokens and classes, never hardcoded values.** Every color, radius, spacing, and motion value comes from a `var(--...)` token in `DesignTokens.uss`. Do not write raw hex, px, or ms in component rules. If a value you need has no token, add the token first, then reference it.
2. **Never put `var(...)` in an inline UXML `style="..."` attribute.** Unity 6's clone-time `StyleVariableResolver` throws and the whole `VisualTreeAsset` fails to clone ("The UXML file set for the UIDocument could not be cloned"). Author a USS class and add the class in UXML instead. `var(...)` is fine inside `.uss` files.
3. **Class naming is BEM with a `ds-` prefix.** Block `.ds-btn`, element `.ds-btn__icon` (double underscore), modifier `.ds-btn--primary` (double hyphen), state `.is-active` / `.is-open` / `.is-spinning` (prefixed `is-`). Do not invent a new prefix or fork an existing component under a new name.
4. **The showcase is the test suite.** Every component, state, and variant must appear in `Assets/Showcase/Resources/DesignSystemShowcase.uxml`. A rule change that does not update the showcase is incomplete.
5. **`.meta` files are tracked on purpose.** Do not add them to `.gitignore`. They carry `svgType: 3` for icons and the asmdef import settings consumers rely on.
6. **A font with no fallback chain is a bug, not a default.** Unity silently serves missing glyphs from an OS font, so Arabic renders as Arial and Japanese as Microsoft YaHei *in the Editor* and as empty boxes in a WebGL build, with no warning in either. Never judge multilingual text by what the Editor shows. `DsFonts.Coverage` resolves through the explicit chain only; `Design System > Showcase > Verify Fonts` fails loudly on a gap.
7. **A fallback chain is still not enough for CJK.** Chinese, Japanese and Korean share codepoints they *draw differently*, and a chain resolves per codepoint, not per language — so the first CJK font in it wins all the shared Han and Chinese comes out in Japanese letterforms. Nothing is missing, so coverage passes and the verifier goes green. Name the face with `DsFonts.ApplyFace` when you know the language. See `docs/FONTS.md`.
8. **Every material family's solid branch starts with `dsfx_ownGeometry(f)`.** Unity 6000.5 batches *descendant* quads into an ancestor's custom-material draw, so a plain solid child (a swatch, a status dot, an active-row background) arrives in your family's fragment shader; shade it and it renders as an invisible chip of your material. Everything failing the test takes `dsfx_passthrough`. This is the single easiest thing in the FX system to regress, and it fails as a rendering oddity rather than an error. Related and equally load-bearing: call `dsfx_wellShade` **unconditionally**, never from inside a profile branch — from inside one it crashes FXC with no message. See `docs/MATERIALS.md`.
9. **Material markers are `ds-fx-` prefixed and are not styling classes.** They carry no USS rules; they are instructions read by C# (`DsFxSpec`). Rule 3's BEM grammar governs component classes — do not try to make markers obey it, and do not add USS rules for them.

## Use the design system in your project

1. Install one of three ways (README, "Installation"): copy `Assets/DesignSystem/` into your project, add it as a git submodule plus an OS-level link, or add the UPM git URL `https://github.com/sinanata/unity-ui-toolkit-design-system.git?path=/Assets/DesignSystem`.
2. Attach the master stylesheet to your UIDocument's UXML and put `ds-root` on the top element:
   ```xml
   <Style src="project://database/Assets/DesignSystem/Resources/UI/Styles/DesignSystem/DesignSystem.uss" />
   <ui:VisualElement class="ds-root">
     <ui:Button text="Get started" class="ds-btn ds-btn--primary" />
   </ui:VisualElement>
   ```
3. Build screens by composing `ds-*` classes. The canonical list of every class, its DOM, and its states is `docs/COMPONENTS.md`; the showcase UXML is the second source of truth.
4. For touch layouts, add `mobile` to the screen root (`root.AddToClassList("mobile")`). Same UXML, same classes, flipped sizing.
5. **Theme with a `ThemeData` asset, not by hand-writing a token block.** Duplicate `Resources/UI/Themes/Dark`, edit it in `Design System > Theme Configurator`, and add a `ThemeApplier` to your `UIDocument` or `PanelRenderer`. The asset bakes its tokens into a real stylesheet and the applier adds that one sheet to the root; the `var()` cascade does the rest. Set `scopeSelector` to `:root` to theme the whole panel, or to a class (`.theme-night`) to theme only a subtree — that is how the shipped `Light` theme works. A hand-written token block attached after `DesignSystem.uss` still works and is what `ShowcaseTheme.uss` does, but the asset is the supported path. See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
6. You do not wire the runtime. `DesignSystemBehaviour` auto-attaches to every UIDocument (and every PanelRenderer on 6000.5+) and injects toggle knobs, drives spinner rotation, animates skeleton shimmer, and wires drag and drop. If you clone templates lazily and want to avoid a one-frame flat-toggle flash, call the runtime's `EnsureToggleKnobs(root)` helper after the clone (see `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`).

## Repository layout

- `Assets/DesignSystem/` is the shippable package, and the only folder a consumer copies.
  - `Resources/UI/Styles/DesignSystem/`: 14 USS files. `DesignSystem.uss` is the master that `@import`s the rest in a load-bearing order.
  - `Resources/Textures/Icons/`: 120 white-fill SVGs.
  - `Resources/UI/Themes/`: the `Dark` and `Light` `ThemeData` assets the package ships. Regenerate with `Design System > Generate Built-in Themes`; `Dark` must stay identical to `DesignTokens.uss`.
  - `Runtime/Behaviour/`: `DesignSystemBehaviourBase<TComponent>` plus `UIDocument/` and `PanelRenderer/` backends.
  - `Runtime/Theme/`: `ThemeData` (the token store and USS generator) and `ThemeRuntime` + `ThemeApplierBase<T>` + two concrete backends. Runtime only — no editor code lives under `Runtime/`.
  - `Runtime/Typography/`: `OpenTypeFace` (a `name`/`OS2`/`head`/`fvar` reader — pure C#, no Unity API, because the same code runs in the editor importer AND in a player that just downloaded a font), `DsFontFamily`, `DsFonts`, and `DsGoogleFonts` (runtime download, behind the `DS_WEBREQUEST` version define).
  - `Runtime/Fx/`: the material FX pipeline, entirely behind `#if UNITY_6000_5_OR_NEWER` (it is built on `style.unityMaterial`). `DsFxRegistry`/`DsFxFamily` (the OPEN family table — there is no built-in list of materials to edit; a family registers itself), `DsFxSpec` (the `ds-fx-` grammar), `DsFxSkin` (translates element facts into uniforms; every push builds a FRESH `MaterialDefinition`, and that is correctness, not style — see its header), `DsFxManager` (one global float per frame is the whole runtime; also `RunAfter`, a scheduler-independent deferral used because world-space panels do not tick their per-panel scheduler in a player), `DsFxPalette` (tone ladder, enamel ink, contrast floors), `DsFxTheme` (the role mapper: what a `ds-btn` or a `ds-input` IS, plus the readability rules), `DsFxBlueprintFamily`. Materials also render on world-space panels; a WebGL player needs two engine workarounds (a geometry-buffer overrun patched by `Tools/UirStagingPatch`, and a RenderTexture-per-panel fallback in the showcase for a native draw-path gap) — `docs/MATERIALS.md` has the full account. Do not "fix" the RT fallback or the `RunAfter` deferral back onto a panel scheduler; both exist for world-space players.
  - `Resources/Fx/Shaders/`: `DsFx.cginc` (the shader foundation every family builds on) and `DsFxBlueprint.shader` (the shipped family and the worked example — read it before writing your own). Shaders live under `Resources/` because a player build strips shaders nothing references, and a runtime-built material references none.
  - `Editor/`: `EditorHelpers.cs` (a menu action that attaches the stylesheet), `Theme/` (the Theme Configurator, the baker, the preset generators), `Typography/` (the Google Fonts window, catalogue, importer, `FontAssetFactory`, `FontUssWriter`), and `Fx/DsFxCompileCheck.cs` (`Design System > FX > Compile Check` — use it; importing a shader only parses it, and the first real compile otherwise happens at first draw in play mode).
- `Assets/Showcase/`, `Assets/Editor/`, `Assets/WebGLTemplates/`, and `Tools/` are the **host project** that builds the live web demo. They are not part of the package. Do not copy them into a consuming project, and do not add product-specific dependencies to the package's own C#.
- `docs/`: ARCHITECTURE.md, COMPONENTS.md, FONTS.md, ICONS.md, MATERIALS.md, MOBILE.md.

## Conventions when editing the system

- **File-load order is load-bearing.** `DesignSystem.uss` imports Tokens, Typography, Icons, Buttons, Inputs, TabsAndFilters, Cards, Navigation, Badges, Controls, Overlays, Feedback, then **Mobile last**. Specificity ties resolve by source order, so a later file specializes an earlier one (for example `.ds-search__icon` at 18px wins over `.ds-icon` at 20px). Mobile loads last so `.mobile` overrides always win. Do not reorder without reading the comments.
- **Where a rule lives:** tokens in `DesignTokens.uss`, text in `Typography.uss`, icons in `Icons.uss`, and so on. The full routing table is in `CONTRIBUTING.md`. A new component family gets a new `<Family>.uss` appended to the import chain before `Mobile.uss`.
- **Icons are white-fill SVGs** imported as `svgType: 3` (Texture) and tinted via `-unity-background-image-tint-color`. Black-fill SVGs render black regardless of tint. To add one, drop the SVG in `Resources/Textures/Icons/`, set SVG Type to Texture, and add one line to `Icons.uss`: `.ds-icon--name { background-image: resource("Textures/Icons/name"); }` (the class uses hyphens, the file uses underscores).
- **No `Resources.Load<Texture2D>` for icons in C#.** Icons resolve via USS `resource(...)`.
- **No `using LeapOfLegends.*` or other product-specific imports** in the package's C#.
- Comments explain **why**, not what (for example, why 18px and not 16).

## Build, preview, and validate

Windows-first Unity 6 project (host editor 6000.5.2f1). There is no unit-test suite; validation is visual, through the showcase.

- **Editor preview:** open the project in Unity Hub, open `Assets/Showcase/Showcase.unity`, press Play. USS edits show on the next frame. Hover any element to read its selector chain.
- **WebGL build (what visitors see), from the repo root in PowerShell:**
  ```powershell
  git submodule update --init --recursive   # first time: the build orchestrator is a submodule
  .\Tools\Build\Build-Showcase.ps1 -Serve   # builds to build/WebGL/ and serves http://localhost:3000
  ```
  `-Serve` runs a local server, `-Deploy` force-pushes a single commit to `gh-pages`, `-ClearCache` recovers from a stale Burst cache. First build is about 5 minutes; warm builds about 2.
- **Verify UI changes at both desktop and `.mobile` widths**, and confirm the WebGL build matches the editor. That is what catches the `var()`-in-inline-UXML crash and mobile-breakpoint regressions.
