# DeskMadeline contribution rules

## Exact-port requirement

DeskMadeline is an exact behavioral and audiovisual port, not a Celeste-inspired
reimplementation. Every change must be cross-checked against the original Celeste
source and assets in `celeste_reference/` and `celeste_graphics_dump/` (neither is in
the repository; `SETUP.md` says how to make them), or against the named mod's upstream
source when implementing mod functionality.

- Port the original constants, state transitions, update order, collision checks,
  input buffers, timers, animation frame timing, particles, colors, compositing,
  sound event paths, sound parameters, and event timing.
- Preserve frame-order details, including freeze frames, component/state-machine
  ordering, coroutine delays, and when effects are created relative to rendering.
- Use the original sprites and original FMOD events. Never add synthesized,
  approximate, placeholder, or "similar" assets or behavior.
- Do not guess when source material can answer the question. Inspect the source and
  document any desktop-specific adaptation in code beside the adaptation.
- Keep desktop-only policy choices (focus gating, monitor boundaries, menus, and
  persistence) separate from the ported gameplay logic.
- If an exact port is blocked by a missing dependency or asset, leave that portion
  disabled and report the limitation instead of silently substituting behavior.
- Verify changes with frame-level or state-level regression checks where practical,
  build Release with zero warnings/errors, and compare observable behavior with the
  original implementation before considering the work complete.

## Behavior is emergent; never special-case it

Most of what a player recognizes as Celeste is not named anywhere in Celeste's source.
Supers, hypers, wavedashes, ultras, cornerboosts, wallbounces and the dream double jump
have no code of their own: they fall out of ordinary systems interacting. Reproduce the
systems and the tech appears by itself.

- When a behavior is missing or feels wrong, find the mismatch in the underlying system
  and fix that. Never add a mechanism whose only purpose is to reproduce an observation.
  A special case reproduces one symptom and diverges everywhere else that system is used.
- Never shadow a vanilla variable with a parallel one. Every site that clears the original
  must also clear the shadow, and a single missed site is a new exploit. Port the vanilla
  field, with the vanilla name, lifetime and clear sites.
- If vanilla stores something as a flag, port it as a flag. Widening it into a timer
  invents a window that vanilla does not have.
- Worked example: the dream double jump is `DreamDashEnd` re-granting the ordinary
  `jumpGraceTimer` on a horizontal exit, even though the exit-frame jump just consumed it.
  `dreamJump` is only a sound selector. An added parallel "dream grace timer" reproduced
  the double jump and simultaneously handed out free mid-air jumps after wall jumps,
  because the wall-jump paths only cleared the vanilla timer.

## The engine is part of the port

Frame counts come from Monocle, not from Celeste's entity code. Porting a `Player` method
without its engine context silently changes input windows.

- `StateMachine.Update` runs the state update *before* the state coroutine, so a state's
  update method runs one extra time on the frame its coroutine finishes.
- `Coroutine.orig_Update` tests the wait timer *before* decrementing it, so a wait ends on
  the frame the timer is no longer positive, not the frame it reaches zero.
- `yield return null` costs a real frame, with the state update running during it.
- Consequence: the dash Super/Hyper window is 12 `DashUpdate` frames. Rewriting
  `DashCoroutine` as a plain countdown loses two of them.
- Update order inside `Player.orig_Update` is load-bearing: the wall boost reads the
  previous frame's `moveX`, retained wall speed is restored before the state machine, and
  the dash floor snap runs after the state machine and before `MoveH`.
- Guard conditions are as much a part of the port as the numbers. `onGround` is only
  evaluated while `Speed.Y >= 0`; `lastClimbMove` is sampled before the slip override.
- Some correct behaviour looks like a bug from the outside. A dream hyper comes out a super
  whenever she reached the block already crouched, because `DashBegin` stands up an airborne
  crouched player and its `else if` cannot crouch her again — which is the whole reason
  Celeste players say not to demo-dash into the block. Forcing the crouch there would "fix"
  the report and break the rule. `DreamHyperChecks` pins both outcomes.
- *When* input is sampled is itself a mechanic. Vanilla refreshes `lastAim` every frame and
  `DashCoroutine` reads it when it resumes, after the freeze - so the aim held about four
  frames *after* the dash press is the one that counts. Latching input at the press frame
  looks like a harmless simplification and silently deletes the hand demo dash: press down
  with dash to duck at `DashBegin`, then swap to a horizontal aim before it is sampled.
  Never snapshot input early "to keep it stable"; sample it where vanilla samples it.

## Constants

- Trace a constant to where vanilla actually sets it, not to a similar-looking neighbour.
  Input buffers come from `VirtualButton(binding, pad, bufferTime, triggerThreshold)`:
  Jump, Dash and CrouchDash all buffer 0.08s, which is not the 0.1s `JumpGraceTime`.
- Vanilla often reads one binding through several differently tuned accessors.
  `Input.MoveX`, `MoveY`, `GliderMoveY` and `Aim` are the same buttons at 0.3, 0.7, 0.3 and
  0.25. Collapsing them is invisible on a keyboard and wrong on a controller: at full
  diagonal deflection a stick reads ~0.61 after deadzone rescaling, so an up-diagonal dash
  is impossible if dash aim is gated at the 0.7 movement threshold.
- Port vanilla's default bindings, including the ones deliberately left unbound.

## Verifying movement

- Prefer a headless harness that drives `Player.Update` at a fixed 60Hz over synthetic
  `Solid`s and asserts vanilla's numbers: 260/-105 super, 325/-52.5 hyper, 1.2x ultra,
  170/-160 wallbounce, 130/-105 wall jump, 0.1s coyote, 12-frame dash window, 10/s climb
  still cost. Frame-level assertions catch what play testing cannot.
- Feed the harness the same input contract the app uses, or the test measures nothing:
  `PetWindow.SampleInput` re-derives `JumpPressed`/`DashPressed` from the buffers every
  frame.
- Assert a window in the unit the source uses (seconds, or a counted frame span), not a
  guessed frame index. When a measurement disagrees with expectation, re-derive the
  expectation from the reference before changing code.
- The checks live in `tests/DeskMadeline.Tests`; add to them rather than starting over.

## Sound

- Sounds are the original Celeste FMOD events, played from an installed copy of the game.
  There are no substitute samples, so an event path is either vanilla's or nothing.
- Which events fire, and in what order, is part of the port. `Play` calls in the reference
  are as load-bearing as the numbers beside them: `SuperJump` plays `jump` *and then* its
  `jump_super` / `jump_superslide` layer, and a move that plays one of a pair plays both.
- `Player.PlaySound` only queues onto `SoundEvents`, which `PetWindow` drains. That makes
  sound headless-testable: drive the move and read the queue, exactly as `SoundChecks` does.
  Assert what was heard *and* how many times, since a doubled sound is as wrong as a missing
  one.
- Watch for effects vanilla fires from two places. `CallDashEvents` is reached by
  `DashCoroutine` on the dash's second frame *and* by `DashEnd`, guarded by
  `calledDashEvents`, precisely so a dash cut short on frame one still sounds. Any move that
  leaves a state early is a candidate for this; port the End callback, not just the
  coroutine.
- Sound is gated on state that is easy to get subtly wrong: `orig_Update` sounds a duck
  wherever it happens but a stand only while `onGround`. Read the guard, not just the call.
- A missing event is silent rather than loud: `SoundEffects.Play` logs and swallows. Nothing
  will look broken, so verify against the queue, and use the opt-in bank check
  (`SFXCHECK=1`) when an event path itself is in question.
