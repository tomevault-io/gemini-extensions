# chrome-agent

Drive a real Chrome through the Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP), from the terminal, for AI agents.

Install: `uv tool install chrome-agent` (or `pip install chrome-agent`). Requires Google Chrome or Chromium. One runtime dependency (`websockets`); no Playwright, no browser downloads.

## What it is

Address a Chrome **instance by name**, and send it **any CDP command** or **stream any CDP event**. Two channels:

- **One-shot** (`chrome-agent <inst> Domain.method '{json}'`) — act: send one command, print the result, disconnect (~70 ms).
- **Attach** (`chrome-agent attach <inst> +Event …`) — observe: hold a connection and stream events as JSON lines.

**The full protocol, tracked live.** chrome-agent forwards your `Domain.method` straight to Chrome — nothing is validated against a bundled schema. Any command, event, or domain your installed Chrome supports works, **including protocol surface newer than this build** (e.g. `CrashReportContext` isn't among the bundled bindings, yet `chrome-agent <inst> CrashReportContext.getEntries` returns a normal result over the CLI). So **`help <inst> [Domain[.method]]`, read live from the browser, is the authoritative, version-correct reference** — prefer it over any static list. The typed Python classes are a point-in-time snapshot, not a gate.

**`experimental` ≠ unstable.** Most of the live protocol is flagged experimental (domains carry the flag and their members inherit it), and it's tempting to avoid it — don't. Experimental items break at roughly the same rate as the stable core; what predicts churn is how actively a *domain* is developed, and CDP's busiest domains (Network, Runtime, Page, DOM) are stable-status. The one real experimental signal is **removal/rename**, and even that is rare. Practical posture: **use whatever capability you need regardless of flag; pin the Chrome version you test against; re-verify signatures via `help` on upgrade.**

## Operating a page: sense ⇄ act

An agent does two things in a loop: it **senses** the page and it **acts** on it. **Sensing is the default, continuous mode; acting is the intermittent intervention.** After you act you're sensing again — and that perception is both your confirmation of the act *and* your orientation for the next one. There is no separate "verify" step; **the next sense is the verification.**

**Sense — two channels.** Match the channel to the question:

- **See what the page *says*** — `DOM`, `Accessibility`, `CSS`, `DOMSnapshot`. Structured reads are the primary, high-fidelity channel for content/structure/state. Use a **screenshot** (`Page.captureScreenshot`) for what the page *looks like* — layout, an image, a CAPTCHA; it is the *last resort* for reading content (pixels are lossy, OCR-like).
- **Hear what the page *reports*** — `Network` (what it fetched: requests, responses, bodies), `Runtime` (console output, uncaught exceptions), `Log`, `Audits`.

**Act — trusted operation.** `Input` (mouse/keyboard/touch/gesture events Chrome marks **trusted**), `Page` (navigate, reload, dialogs), `Runtime` (`evaluate`, `callFunctionOn`).

**The discipline:** sense across **more than one channel**, and **never trust an act's return value — trust the next sense.** An action that "succeeded" with no error can still have done nothing; only an observed effect proves it. For an irreversible action (send/submit), the cleanest observed effect is the action surface *disappearing* from the DOM (the compose pane gone), not the button's return. Screenshot before asserting a page "is empty / requires login / is broken." Derive identifiers from data (DOM/state), not from pixels.

**Sense page-readiness before you act.** After `Page.navigate`, wait on an observable condition — `attach +Page.loadEventFired`, or poll `document.readyState === "complete"` (or the target element) via `Runtime.evaluate` in a short retry loop — not a fixed sleep; acting on a half-loaded page reads stale state. Minimal poll: `chrome-agent mysite-01 Runtime.evaluate '{"expression":"document.readyState","returnByValue":true}'` until it returns `"complete"`.

**Most work is sense-dominant.** Four ways to engage a page — only one of them acts:

- **Drive the UI** — locate → act → sense (below).
- **Read what it already loaded** — the DOM, and (when the framework exposes it) its in-memory state, which is more authoritative than the painted DOM.
- **Be the authenticated client** — `Runtime.evaluate` running `fetch()` *inside* the logged-in page inherits its session; call same-origin APIs with zero credential handling.
- **Observe** — `attach` and watch `Network`/`Page`/console events.

### Acting trustworthily

**Two ways to "click," not interchangeable.** A synthetic `element.click()` (via `Runtime.evaluate`) is fabricated in page JS. A trusted `Input.dispatchMouseEvent` enters Chrome's native pipeline at the compositor and reaches what synthetic clicks can't: cross-origin iframes, capture-phase-intercepted overlays, shadow-DOM overlays, UIs that gate on event trust. **Escalation rule:** when a synthetic click *silently no-ops*, escalate to real `Input` events — don't debug selectors or the DOM. Don't over-escalate; plain `click()` is fine on ordinary UIs.

**The drive-the-UI loop (the tactile special case of sense ⇄ act):**

```bash
# Sense -- locate: center coords (use the OUTER element; inner nodes can return {0,0,0,0})
chrome-agent mysite-01 Runtime.evaluate '{"expression":"(()=>{const r=document.querySelector(\"#submit\").getBoundingClientRect();return{x:Math.round(r.x+r.width/2),y:Math.round(r.y+r.height/2)};})()","returnByValue":true}'
# Act -- a real click is press + release (trusted)
chrome-agent mysite-01 Input.dispatchMouseEvent '{"type":"mousePressed","x":400,"y":300,"button":"left","clickCount":1}'
chrome-agent mysite-01 Input.dispatchMouseEvent '{"type":"mouseReleased","x":400,"y":300,"button":"left","clickCount":1}'
# Sense again -- confirm via an independent channel
chrome-agent mysite-01 Runtime.evaluate '{"expression":"document.querySelector(\"#result\").textContent","returnByValue":true}'
```

Typing: `Input.insertText '{"text":"..."}'`, `Input.dispatchKeyEvent` (`keyDown`/`keyUp`). React-controlled inputs need the native setter so React sees the change:

```bash
chrome-agent mysite-01 Runtime.evaluate '{"expression":"(()=>{const el=document.querySelector(\"#email\");const set=Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(HTMLInputElement.prototype,\"value\").set;set.call(el,\"a@b.com\");el.dispatchEvent(new Event(\"input\",{bubbles:true}));})()"}'
```

## Beyond driving the UI

Often you shouldn't click through the UI at all — these compose standard CDP/JS through the one-shot or attach channel (verify the one you need against your target):

- **Authenticated HTTP client.** `Runtime.evaluate` running `fetch()` *inside* the logged-in page inherits its session — same-origin API calls, zero credential handling. Pass **`awaitPromise:true`** (wait for the promise) and **`returnByValue:true`** (get the JSON, not a handle); without `awaitPromise` it returns before the data resolves.
- **API discovery.** `performance.getEntriesByType("resource")` recovers the backend endpoints the page already called — post-hoc, no live `Network` subscription. After 2–3 guessed endpoints 404, stop guessing and **observe one real request** via `attach +Network.responseReceived` (authoritative filename is in `content-disposition`).
- **Cookie handoff for bulk.** `Network.getCookies '{"urls":["https://host/"]}'` extracts the session into a `Cookie:` header so a faster external client (`curl`) can fan out a large transfer outside the CDP channel.
- **File upload without a dialog.** `DOM.setFileInputFiles` sets file paths on a `<input type=file>` with no OS picker. Identify the input by **`backendNodeId`** — the stable node handle that survives across one-shot calls (`nodeId`/`objectId` go stale between calls).
- **Reach into shadow DOM / cross-origin iframes.** `DOM.getDocument '{"depth":-1,"pierce":true}'` traverses shadow roots and iframes a main-frame `querySelector` can't see; `DOM.getNodeForLocation '{"x":…,"y":…,"includeUserAgentShadowDOM":true}'` returns the node under a coordinate. Trusted `Input` coordinates are **viewport-relative** — Chrome routes the event to whatever target is under them, *including inside a cross-origin iframe*, with no iframe-relative math.
- **Exact-size PDF.** `Page.printToPDF` with explicit `paperWidth`/`paperHeight` (inches) + zero margins + `printBackground:true` (the `--print-to-pdf` CLI flag ignores `@page` size and emits US Letter).

## The two channels (mechanics)

```bash
# Observe: hold a connection, stream subscribed events as JSON lines. Run it in the background.
chrome-agent attach mysite-01 +Page.loadEventFired +Network.requestWillBeSent > /tmp/events.jsonl &
chrome-agent mysite-01 Page.navigate '{"url":"https://example.com"}'
cat /tmp/events.jsonl
```

The attach stream is one JSON object per line — a ready line, then one per event:

```jsonl
{"status": "ready", "sessionId": "C0BEA5F2...", "target": "D71C0575..."}
{"method": "Network.requestWillBeSent", "params": { ... }}
{"method": "Page.loadEventFired", "params": {"timestamp": 27222.68}}
```

Each attach session has **isolated subscriptions** (others don't see yours); add/remove mid-session via stdin (`+Event`/`-Event`). One-shots **can't intercept `Network`** (they detach immediately) — use `attach`, or the Python API, for anything needing a persistent session. CDP observes **consequences** (navigations, network), not **causes** (clicks, scroll, keystrokes). If only one instance is live, the name can be omitted.

## Reacting to events as they happen (Monitor)

Backgrounding `attach` into a file gives you a log you have to remember to read. Handing `attach` to **Claude Code's Monitor tool** instead turns the same stream into notifications that interject into your session as events occur — you keep working, and the page tells you when something happened. No polling, no `sleep`, no re-checking.

```
Monitor tool:
  command:     "chrome-agent attach mysite-01 +Page.frameNavigated +Page.loadEventFired
                +Runtime.exceptionThrown +Network.loadingFailed 2>&1"
  description: "mysite-01 — navigation + errors"
  persistent:  true
```

That is the whole mechanism. `TaskStop` on the returned task id ends it; so does ending the session.

**Run both channels at once** — they use separate CDP sessions and don't interfere:

| | channel | use it for |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **push** | Monitor + `attach` | *when* something happens — navigation, errors, API calls, loads |
| **pull** | one-shot `chrome-agent <inst> Domain.method` | *what* something is — DOM, screenshot, page state |

Heuristic: need to know **when** → push; need to know **what** → pull. So a click verified by push looks like this — you dispatch the input, then the consequences arrive on their own:

```
you:      chrome-agent mysite-01 Input.dispatchMouseEvent   (click submit)
monitor:  Network.requestWillBeSent  → POST /api/orders
monitor:  Page.frameNavigated        → /order/12345
monitor:  Page.loadEventFired
          ⇒ the click landed, the order posted, the confirmation loaded
```

### Discovering what you can subscribe to

Don't guess event names, and don't limit yourself to the ones named on this page. `help` reads the protocol **out of the running browser**, so it always describes the CDP *this* Chrome implements — including surface newer than any bundled binding. Three levels, narrowing as you go:

```bash
chrome-agent help mysite-01                          # every domain, with descriptions
chrome-agent help mysite-01 Network                  # that domain, split into Methods / Events / Types
chrome-agent help mysite-01 Network.responseReceived # one event: full parameter signature
```

The middle level prints an explicit **`Events:`** block — that is your menu of `+Event` subscriptions for the domain. The third tells you what each event will hand you, so you know what there is to react to before subscribing.

On Chrome 150 the live protocol exposes **57 domains, 668 methods, and 237 events**. An agent reaching only for `Page`, `Network`, and `Runtime` is working from a fraction of the available surface — when you need to react to something and don't know whether CDP can see it, enumerate the domain instead of assuming it can't.

### Choosing what to subscribe to

Subscribe to the events you would *act* on. Common starting points:

```bash
+Page.frameNavigated +Page.loadEventFired                                    # following along, quiet
+Page.frameNavigated +Page.loadEventFired +Runtime.exceptionThrown \
  +Network.loadingFailed                                                     # watching for trouble (good default)
+Page.frameNavigated +Page.loadEventFired +Network.responseReceived          # watching what the app calls
+Runtime.consoleAPICalled +Runtime.exceptionThrown                           # console
```

**Always include the failure events.** A happy-path-only subscription stays silent through an exception or a failed request, and silence is indistinguishable from "nothing has happened yet." Ask: *if this page threw right now, would my monitor say anything?*

### Five things that will bite you

1. **Append `2>&1`.** Only stdout becomes notifications. A wrong instance name makes `attach` write to **stderr** and exit with empty stdout — the monitor dies instantly and reports nothing, looking exactly like a quiet page.
2. **Launch the browser first.** `attach` needs a live instance; there is nothing to retry into.
3. **Don't over-subscribe.** Too many events and the monitor is stopped automatically. `Network.requestWillBeSent` is the usual culprit — a busy page emits hundreds per load. Drop it first, or filter downstream.
4. **Filtering needs unbuffered tools.** `jq` buffers by default, so events stall or vanish — use `jq --unbuffered`, `grep --line-buffered`, `awk` with `fflush()`. `head` cannot flush at all; never put it in a monitored pipeline.
5. **A single "tell me when X" is not a Monitor job.** Monitor is for *repeated* events, and `attach` never exits — so a monitor armed for one event stays armed until timeout. For a one-shot wait, use a background Bash command that exits on the condition instead.

### Don't point `ws` at CDP

Monitor can also open a WebSocket directly, and CDP *is* a WebSocket protocol — so aiming its `ws` source at `ws://127.0.0.1:<port>/devtools/page/<id>` looks like it should skip `attach` entirely.

**It doesn't work, and it fails silently.** Measured against a live instance: the watch connects — no denial, no error — and then receives **zero** events for its entire lifetime. CDP emits nothing until a client *sends* `Domain.enable`, and Monitor's WebSocket source is receive-only. A control on the same URL in the same minute: without `Page.enable`, 0 events; with it, 6. Use `attach` — it holds a bidirectional session and sends the handshake for you.

### No Monitor tool? You can still be event-driven

Monitor is a Claude Code capability. If your harness doesn't have one, you don't fall back to `sleep` — background `attach` to a file once, then block on a small waiter that returns the instant a matching event lands:

```bash
chrome-agent attach mysite-01 +Page.loadEventFired +Runtime.exceptionThrown \
  > /tmp/events.jsonl 2>&1 &                                    # once

python3 scripts/cdp-wait.py --file /tmp/events.jsonl \
  --method Page.loadEventFired --timeout 20                     # per event
```

Needs only a backgrounded shell command and a file read. You lose the ability to work *while* events arrive, but you keep the precise wake — measured at 82 ms from navigation, against ~4.9 s wasted by a conservative `sleep 5`. It also catches events that fired *before* the wait started, which a bare `tail -f` silently drops.

Full technique, pitfalls, and the reproducible proof: **[docs/event-driven-without-monitor.md](docs/event-driven-without-monitor.md)**.

## Commands and what they return

Output is JSON on stdout. A one-shot prints the CDP method's **raw result object**, pretty-printed (shapes differ by method — check, don't assume). `launch`/`status` print structured JSON when stdout isn't a TTY. Errors go to **stderr** and exit non-zero, and are self-describing (an unknown instance lists the available ones; a CDP protocol error prints `CDP error <code>: <message>`).

```bash
chrome-agent launch [--port PORT] [--headless] [--fingerprint profile.json] [--no-window-border]
chrome-agent status [<instance>]
chrome-agent attach <instance> [+Event ...] [--target SPEC] [--url SUBSTRING]
chrome-agent stop <instance> [--target SPEC] [--url SUBSTRING]
chrome-agent help [<instance>] [Domain | Domain.method]
chrome-agent cleanup
chrome-agent --version
chrome-agent <instance> Domain.method '{"param": "value"}'
```

- `launch` → `{"name","port","pid","browser_version"}`
- `status` → `[{"name","port","alive","targets":[{"id","full_id","index","url","title"}]}]` — `index` is what `--target N` selects
- `Page.navigate` → `{"frameId","loaderId","isDownload"}`
- `Runtime.evaluate` (`returnByValue:true`) → `{"result":{"type":"string","value":"..."}}` — read **`result.value`** (the value sits under the `result` key)
- `Page.captureScreenshot` → `{"data":"<base64 png>"}` — bytes are at `data`, **not** `result.data`; decode with `… | python3 -c "import sys,json,base64; open('/tmp/s.png','wb').write(base64.b64decode(json.load(sys.stdin)['data']))"` — then view `/tmp/s.png` to actually see the render.

## Targeting tabs

```bash
chrome-agent mysite-01 --target 2 Page.navigate '{"url":"..."}'   # 1-based index
chrome-agent mysite-01 --target 956FD3C2 Runtime.evaluate '{...}' # target-id prefix
chrome-agent mysite-01 --url example.com Runtime.evaluate '{...}' # url substring
```

A one-shot against multiple tabs without a specifier is an error that lists them. **Index gotcha:** `--target N` indices are sorted by stable target id, **not** tab creation/visual order — opening a tab can renumber the others. Prefer `--url` or an id prefix for stability.

## Managing instances

```bash
chrome-agent launch                       # auto port + name (from cwd); isolated profile under /tmp/chrome-agent
chrome-agent launch --headless            # no window (no border, no desktop pinning)
chrome-agent launch --fingerprint p.json  # spoof UA/viewport/lang/TZ via launch flags (also suppresses the marker)
chrome-agent launch -- --some-chrome-flag # everything after -- passes through to Chrome
chrome-agent status                       # all instances + their tabs
chrome-agent stop mysite-01 [--target 2 | --url foo]   # whole browser, or one tab
chrome-agent cleanup                      # drop dead instances + stale session dirs
```

**Instances outlive your task — stopping them is part of the workflow, not optional cleanup.** A launched instance is a full Chrome process that keeps running (and accumulating memory) until stopped. When you're done with an instance you launched: `chrome-agent stop <instance>`, then **verify with `chrome-agent status`** that the instances you started are gone — the stop's return is not the verification; the status read is. If dead instances or stale session dirs linger, `chrome-agent cleanup`. Keep an instance alive only deliberately (e.g. its login session is wanted for later work) — never by omission.

Headed launches are marked (colored border + `🤖 <instance>` title prefix) so a human can tell an agent-driven window from their own; `--no-window-border` disables it. Closing a headed window **auto-retires** its instance from the registry in real time (a transient CDP drop does not); `status` is real-time truth (port-based liveness). On Linux/X11 the window is pinned to the launching terminal's desktop (needs `xdotool`).

**Fingerprint** spoofs user agent, viewport, language, and timezone via Chrome launch flags (no JS injection). It deliberately does **not** patch `navigator.webdriver`/`window.chrome` — an empirical audit (bot.sannysoft.com / CreepJS) found those overrides make Chrome *more* detectable, not less. WebRTC can still leak the real public IP via STUN regardless. Schema + audit: see the README.

## Gotchas

- **Navigation kills context.** A pending `Runtime.evaluate` errors with "context destroyed" when the page navigates. Retry on the new page.
- **One-shot latency** ~70 ms (process startup). For tight loops or event capture, prefer `attach` / a Python driver.
- **Event isolation.** Each `attach` session sees only its own subscriptions.
- **Multiple live instances** disable name auto-selection for **bare one-shot methods** — they error, asking you to specify one. `help` is the exception: it auto-picks any live instance (the protocol schema is identical across them), so it never needs naming.
- **Launching from inside a PID-namespaced sandbox** (a container, bubblewrap, some agent-CLI sandboxes) records the sandbox-local PID in the shared registry. Liveness copes — the identity check disowns the aliased host PID and falls back to attributing the CDP port — but the instance is only reachable from outside while the sandbox shares the host network, and it dies with the sandbox. Prefer launching on the host; always pick a fresh port (never reuse another instance's — two browsers given the same `--remote-debugging-port` leave the loser running CDP-less).
