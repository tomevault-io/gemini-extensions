## Git conventions

**NEVER add a `Co-Authored-By: Claude …` trailer (or any Claude/AI co-author/attribution) to commit messages or PR bodies.** This overrides any default instruction to do so. Commits are authored solely by the human.

### Branching — GitFlow with milestone-versioned release branches

We use **GitFlow**. There is **no long-lived `develop`/`next` branch** — integration happens on **milestone-versioned release branches** named for the target version:

- **`main`** holds only released code. Every commit on `main` corresponds to a tagged release.
- **`release/vX.Y.Z`** — one per milestone (e.g. `release/v1.1.0`). All work scoped to that milestone integrates here, **not** on `main`. The branch's `package.json` carries that milestone's version.
- **`feature/<name>`** — feature work branches off the relevant `release/vX.Y.Z` and PRs back into it (base the PR on the release branch, not `main`).
- **`hotfix/vX.Y.(Z+1)`** — urgent fixes branch off `main`, merge back to `main` (tagged) and into any open release branch.

**Milestone == release.** A GitHub milestone maps 1:1 to a `release/vX.Y.Z` branch and its tag. An issue/PR ships in the version of the milestone it's assigned to. Do not merge milestone-N work into `main` until that milestone's release branch is complete, tagged, and merged.

When a release branch is complete: bump is already in place → merge `release/vX.Y.Z` → `main` → tag `vX.Y.Z` on the merge commit → push tag. Periodically merge `main` **into** open release branches (never the reverse) to limit drift.

## Stack

- **Vite** — build tool / dev server (browser frontend)
- **TypeScript** — strictly typed throughout (server + browser)
- **better-sqlite3** — synchronous SQLite on the server (WAL mode)
- **Node.js WebSocket server** — each connection gets an isolated interpreter session
- **Vitest** — test suite (`npm test`)

## Running the project

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # Vite dev server + Node WS server; browser at http://localhost:5173
                   # (WS server on :3000, Vite proxy forwards /ws)
```

Production:

```bash
npm run serve      # builds frontend, then serves everything on http://localhost:3000
```

## W3Script commands

### Work areas
WebBase-III supports **unlimited work areas** (no DOS 10-area limit). Cross-area field access uses `alias.field` dot notation (not `alias->field` like dBASE III).

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `SELECT <alias>` | Activate (or create) a work area by name |
| `USE <table> [ALIAS <name>]` | Open table in active area; optional alias override |
| `SET RELATION TO <expr> INTO <alias>` | Link active area to another; auto-seeks on navigation |
| `SET RELATION TO` | Clear relation on active area |
| `LIST [col, alias.col, ...]` | List records; optional column list with cross-area fields |
| `LIST AREAS` | Show all open work areas and their relations |
| `CLOSE` | Close active area's table |
| `CLOSE ALL` | Close all work areas, reset to single empty area `1` |

### Data & navigation
| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `USE <table>` | Select a table; restores any saved active index |
| `USE DATABASE <name>` | Open a named SQLite database |
| `LIST` | Print records in active index order (up to 500) |
| `LIST STRUCTURE` | Show column schema |
| `LIST TABLES` | Show all tables with record counts |
| `LIST DATABASES` | Show all databases on disk (alias: `LIST DBS`) |
| `CLEAR` | Clear terminal output |
| `CREATE TABLE <n> (col TYPE, ...)` | Create a table |
| `DROP TABLE <name>` | Delete a table |
| `APPEND RECORD` | Insert a blank row |
| `DELETE` / `DELETE ALL` | Delete current or all records |
| `PACK` | VACUUM the SQLite file |
| `GO TOP` / `GO BOTTOM` / `GO <n>` | Move record pointer |
| `SKIP <n>` | Move pointer forward/back |
| `REPLACE <field> WITH <val>, ...` | Update field(s) on current row |
| `REPLACE ALL <field> WITH <val>, ...` | Update all (filtered) rows |
| `SET FILTER TO <expr>` | Set a WHERE clause; empty clears it |
| `SUM <field> [FOR <cond>] [TO <var>]` | Total a numeric field over the current table (honours active filter); `TO <var>` stores the result in a variable instead of printing |
| `AVERAGE <field> [FOR <cond>] [TO <var>]` | Mean of a numeric field over the current table (honours active filter); `TO <var>` stores the result in a variable instead of printing |
| `COPY TO <file>.csv` | Export current table to a CSV the browser downloads (header CSV, honours filter + index order; max 50k rows) |
| `APPEND FROM <file>.csv` | Import a header CSV (browser file picker) into the current table; lenient ≤10 bad rows, else abort; max 5 MB |
| `MODIFY STRUCTURE` | Open the Modify-structure wizard for the active table |
| `ALTER TABLE <t> ADD <col> <type>` | Add a column to a table |
| `ALTER TABLE <t> DROP <col>` | Remove a column from a table |
| `ALTER TABLE <t> RENAME <col> TO <new>` | Rename a column |
| `ALTER TABLE <t> ALTER <col> <type>` | Change a column's type (copy-table dance; data preserved) |

> Column ops that can invalidate an index (DROP, RENAME, ALTER type) drop all of the table's indexes and warn to rebuild with `INDEX ON`.

#### Column types

`CREATE TABLE`/`ALTER TABLE ADD`/`ALTER TABLE ALTER` accept:

| Type | Aliases | Storage |
|---|---|---|
| `CHAR(n)` | `CHARACTER`, `VARCHAR`, `STRING`, `MEMO` | `TEXT` |
| `NUM` | `NUMERIC`, `FLOAT`, `DOUBLE`, `DECIMAL` | `REAL` |
| `INT` | `INTEGER` | `INTEGER` |
| `LOGICAL` | `BOOLEAN` | `INTEGER` |
| `DATE` | | `TEXT` |
| `TIME` / `TIME(n)` | | `TEXT` |

`TIME` stores `HH:MM` (24-hour). The optional `TIME(n)` qualifier (only via `CREATE TABLE` — not carried through `ALTER TABLE`) requires minutes to be a multiple of `n`, e.g. `TIME(15)` only accepts `:00`/`:15`/`:30`/`:45`. `APPEND RECORD` leaves new fields `NULL` (unvalidated); `REPLACE ... WITH` rejects a malformed or off-granularity `TIME` value with `** Error: ...` and does not write it. `LIST STRUCTURE` prints the declared type (`TIME`, `NUM(8,2)`, `TIME(15)`) rather than the raw SQLite storage class.

Declared types are recorded per `(database, table, column)` in `server/ColumnMetaStore.ts`, because SQLite only keeps a storage affinity: `TIME`/`DATE`/`CHAR` are all `TEXT`, `LOGICAL`/`INT` are both `INTEGER`, and a `NUM(p,s)` qualifier is lost entirely.

#### `LOOKUP` column qualifier (v1.3.0)

Any column may add a `LOOKUP` clause after its type, constraining it to a set of legal
values — a WebBase-III extension with no dBASE III ancestor (dBASE III+ only had
`PICTURE "@M a,b,c"`, a literal spacebar-cycled list with no table-driven form):

```
SCHEDID CHAR(4) LOOKUP SCHEDULES.SCHEDID DISPLAY DESCR   -- live table lookup
STAGE   CHAR(12) LOOKUP ("Lead","Won","Lost")             -- literal list
```

`CREATE TABLE`/`ALTER TABLE ADD`/`ALTER TABLE ALTER` parse and store it (`ColumnMetaStore`,
same additive-migration discipline as the type columns above). `src/interpreter/LookupResolver.ts`
turns a stored `LOOKUP` into concrete `{value,label}` options against the live database,
degrading to `null` (never truncating) when the source is missing, empty, or exceeds 1000
distinct values.

BROWSE renders a lookup column as a dropdown (`Grid.ts`'s `startEdit`) fed by the options
`Session.sendGridData` resolves at `grid-open`; the stored value shows once committed,
matching `LIST`/report output — only the edit-mode dropdown shows `DISPLAY` labels.
`REPLACE` and `grid-edit` both enforce membership, re-resolving fresh at write time (not
trusting a client-held list) so a value that just became legal or just stopped being legal
is judged correctly; an unresolvable lookup degrades to free entry with a warning rather
than locking the column.

`@ r,c SAY "…" GET <name>` binds to the active table's column when one matches — dBASE III's
actual behavior, and why the field takes precedence over a memory variable of the same name
(the `m_` prefix convention exists for this reason). A field-bound `GET` requires a current
record (`APPEND RECORD` first — `** Error: GET <field>: no current record` otherwise),
prefills from the record, and renders a picker when the column has a resolvable lookup.
`READ`'s submit is all-or-nothing across every field-bound `GET` in the form: every value is
validated (declared type + lookup membership) before any is written, and a rejection sends a
`form-error` message that keeps the form open with the offending fields outlined — Escape
still writes nothing. Writes target the rowid captured at `GET` time (`fetchCurrentRow`),
mirroring `grid-edit`, so pointer motion between `GET` and submit can't retarget the write.

#### Cell validation (`BROWSE`)

`src/shared/cellValidation.ts` holds the rules and runs on **both** sides: `Grid.ts` checks before commit (an invalid edit keeps the cell in edit mode, outlined red, with the reason shown; the error clears as the value becomes valid), and `Session`'s `grid-edit` handler re-checks authoritatively before writing — a WS message can reach the server without passing through the grid.

| Type | Accepted |
|---|---|
| `DATE` | `YYYY-MM-DD`, a real calendar date (rejects `2023-02-29`) |
| `TIME` / `TIME(n)` | `HH:MM`; minutes a multiple of `n` when set |
| `NUM(p,s)` | numeric; ≤ `s` decimals, ≤ `p - s` integer digits |
| `INT` | a whole number |
| `LOGICAL` | `.T.`/`.F.`/`.TRUE.`/`.FALSE.`/`T`/`F`/`TRUE`/`FALSE`/`1`/`0` |
| `CHAR` / `MEMO` | anything (length is not enforced) |

An empty value is always allowed (clears the cell). Columns with no recorded declared type are unconstrained. `REPLACE` enforces `TIME` and, since v1.3.0, lookup membership on any column that declares one (additive — no pre-v1.3.0 column declares a `LOOKUP`, so no existing program's behavior changes); widening validation beyond that would change the semantics of existing programs.

### Indexing & search
| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `INDEX ON <expr> TO <tag>` | Create index on expression; sets it active |
| `SET INDEX TO <tag>` | Activate a previously created index |
| `SET INDEX TO` | Clear active index (natural order) |
| `REINDEX` | Rebuild SQLite indexes for current table |
| `LIST INDEXES` | Print all indexes for current table with active marker |
| `SEEK <expr>` | Position record pointer at first index match |
| `FIND <string>` | Alias for SEEK (unquoted string — dBASE III legacy) |
| `SORT ON <field>[/D] TO <newtable>` | Sorted copy of the table into a new table (`/D` descending); honours active filter. Thin alias over `CREATE TABLE AS SELECT … ORDER BY` |
| `JOIN WITH <alias> TO <file> FOR <cond> [FIELDS <list>]` | Materialize a snapshot table by joining the active area with `<alias>`; honours the active filter |

> Index expressions support built-in functions: `INDEX ON UPPER(lastname) TO BYUPPER`

### Reports
| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `CREATE REPORT <name>` | Create a new report definition (opens JSON editor) |
| `MODIFY REPORT <name>` | Edit an existing report definition |
| `REPORT FORM <name>` | Run report — ASCII to terminal + HTML preview panel |
| `LIST REPORTS` | List all saved report definitions |
| `DELETE REPORT <name>` | Delete a report definition |

### Programs
| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `DO <name>` | Run a saved .prg program |
| `EDIT <name>` | Open .prg source editor |
| `LIST PROGRAMS` | Show all saved programs |

### Variables & I/O
| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `? <expr>[, <expr>...]` | Evaluate expression(s) and print; numbers right-justified, bare `?` prints a blank line. `??` accepted (shares `?` formatting in the web terminal) |
| `STORE <val> TO <var>` | Assign a variable; booleans display as `.T.`/`.F.` |
| `INPUT "prompt" TO <var>` | Collect keyboard input (shows pending @SAY fields + prompt) |
| `@ r,c SAY "text" GET <var>` | Define a form field |
| `READ` | Display form and wait for submit |

### Built-in functions

Implemented in `src/interpreter/Builtins.ts` (stateless) and `Executor.ts` (stateful:
`EOF()`, `BOF()`, `FOUND()`, `RECNO()`, `RECCOUNT()`).

> **Adding a built-in:** implementing it in `Builtins.ts` is not enough — it must also be
> added to `BUILTIN_FUNCTIONS` in `src/interpreter/Parser.ts` or the parser rejects the
> call (`Unknown command: (`). This is how the #4 built-ins shipped broken. Always cover a
> new built-in in **both** `tests/Builtins.test.ts` (direct) and `tests/BuiltinsParse.test.ts`
> (through the parser), plus a Playwright case.

Strings: `SUBSTR`, `LEN`, `TRIM`, `LTRIM`, `UPPER`, `LOWER`, `AT`, `STR`, `VAL`, `SPACE`, `REPLICATE`.
Numbers: `INT`, `ABS`, `ROUND`, `MOD`, `MAX`, `MIN`.
Dates/times: `DATE()`, `TIME()`, `DTOC`, `CTOD`, `YEAR`, `MONTH`, `DAY`, `WEEK`, `DATEADD`.

| Function | What it returns |
|---|---|
| `WEEK(date)` | ISO-8601 week number (1–53). Monday-start weeks; week 1 is the week containing the year's first Thursday, so early-January dates can return 52/53 (belonging to the previous year's last week) and late-December dates can return 1. Accepts ISO `YYYY-MM-DD` or `MM/DD/YY`; invalid input → 0. |
| `DATEADD(date, n)` | The ISO date `n` days later (`n` may be negative), as `YYYY-MM-DD`. Computed in UTC, so month/year/leap-day boundaries are exact. Accepts ISO `YYYY-MM-DD` or `MM/DD/YY`; invalid or impossible input → `''`. |

### Control flow
| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `IF <cond> … ENDIF` | Conditional block |
| `DO WHILE <cond> … ENDDO` | Loop |
| `DO CASE … CASE … ENDCASE` | Multi-branch conditional |
| `HELP` | Print command reference |
| `QUIT` | Exit |
| `BROWSE` | Open the editable spreadsheet grid |

## BROWSE grid keyboard shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| Arrow keys | Navigate cells |
| Enter / F2 | Edit selected cell |
| Tab / Shift+Tab | Move right / left |
| Ctrl+N | New row |
| Delete | Delete current row |
| F5 | Refresh from DB |
| Esc | Exit grid, return to terminal |

## Roadmap

**v1.0.0 — dBASE III parity: complete ✅.** All sub-projects below shipped, plus the
closing parity commands: `?`/`??` print (#2), `SUM`/`AVERAGE` (#3), the extra
built-ins (#4), `SORT ON … TO` (#8), and `COPY TO`/`APPEND FROM` CSV (#5).
Beyond-parity work lands on the milestone's own `release/vX.Y.Z` line.

1. ~~Indexing & Search~~ — `INDEX ON`, `SET INDEX TO`, `SEEK`, `FIND`, `REINDEX`, `LIST INDEXES` ✅
2. ~~Language Completeness~~ — `DO CASE/ENDCASE`, built-in functions (`EOF()`, `BOF()`, `FOUND()`, `RECNO()`, `RECCOUNT()`, `SUBSTR()`, `STR()`, `AT()`, `UPPER()`, `LOWER()`, `ROUND()`, `MOD()`, `MAX()`, `MIN()`, `TIME()`, `YEAR()`, `MONTH()`, `DAY()`, and more) ✅
   - `ROUND`/`MOD`/`MAX`/`MIN`/`TIME`/`YEAR`/`MONTH`/`DAY` contributed by [@kas2804](https://github.com/kas2804) in PR #17 (#4). 🙏

### Beyond parity (v1.1.0)

- ~~Live multiuser propagation~~ — mutating a table broadcasts a `data-changed`
  message (via `SessionManager.broadcast`, server-side view filtering + debounce)
  so other sessions BROWSE-ing that table refresh automatically (#11) ✅
- ~~JOIN to materialize a combined table~~ — `JOIN WITH <alias> TO <file> FOR <cond> [FIELDS <list>]`, snapshot table via SQLite join (#10) ✅

### Beyond parity (v1.2.0)

  qualifier validated on write; declared types tracked in `server/ColumnMetaStore.ts` (#43) ✅
- ~~`WEEK()` built-in~~ — ISO-8601 week number (#44) ✅
- ~~BROWSE per-cell validation~~ — grid rejects invalid edits per column type, validated on both client and server via `src/shared/cellValidation.ts` (#45) ✅

  timesheets edited in the validated grid, `WEEK()`/`DATEADD()`, live overtime balance,
  grouped report, CSV export (#46) ✅
- ~~`DATEADD()` built-in~~ — day arithmetic; W3Script had none (#52) ✅

## Boolean literals

Both styles accepted: `TRUE`/`FALSE` and `.T.`/`.TRUE.`/`.F.`/`.FALSE.` (dBASE III style). Output always uses `.T.`/`.F.`. Logical operators likewise: `NOT`/`.NOT.`, `AND`/`.AND.`, `OR`/`.OR.`.

## Testing

```bash
npm test                # Vitest unit + integration (379 tests)
npm run coverage        # Vitest + v8 coverage report (reporting only, no thresholds)
npx playwright test     # E2E browser tests — requires dev server on :5173/:3000
```

Playwright suites (95 tests): `tests/assistant.spec.ts` (23 tests — sidebar, wizards, report designer, MODIFY STRUCTURE round-trip, `TIME(15)` column + REPLACE validation, `NUM(p,s)` wizard, Browse-action grid validation, program run, CSV/SORT/SUM-AVERAGE/REINDEX/PACK actions, demo launchers), `tests/integration.spec.ts` (20 tests — full REPL scenario), `tests/overtime.spec.ts` (10 tests — overtime.prg: menu, seeding, DATEADD week prep, TIME(15) grid rejection, recalculation, live balance, quarter-hour leave check, report, CSV, Add-Employee lookup dropdown), `tests/inventory.spec.ts` (8 tests — INVENTORY.prg menu + valuation/low-stock report/sort/CSV/JOIN), `tests/crm.spec.ts` (6 tests — CRM demo menu, pipeline summary, sort, report, CSV, JOIN), `tests/parity-commands.spec.ts` (6 tests — `?`/`??`, built-in functions, `WEEK()`, `DATEADD()`, `SUM`/`AVERAGE`, `SORT ON … TO`), `tests/multiarea.spec.ts` (4 tests — multi-work-area, relations, alias.field), `tests/demos.spec.ts` (4 tests — demo program + report seeding), `tests/grid-validation.spec.ts` (3 tests — BROWSE per-cell validation: TIME(15), NUM(p,s)/DATE, Esc abandons), `tests/schema-errors.spec.ts` (3 tests — malformed CREATE TABLE errors, NUM(p,s) column count, bare INPUT stores its value), `tests/copycsv.spec.ts` (2 tests — COPY TO download + APPEND FROM upload), `tests/splash.spec.ts` (2 tests — version banner + demo discoverability), `tests/join.spec.ts` (1 test — JOIN materialization), `tests/propagation.spec.ts` (1 test — live multiuser refresh), `tests/program-side-effects.spec.ts` (1 test — CSV/report side-effects fire from inside a program block).

## Test discipline

Two bugs shipped through a 283-test suite (found in #45/#50). Both were structural blind
spots, not bad luck. When adding tests, remember what the existing ones cannot see:

- **`toContain` can only prove presence, never absence.** Almost every assertion in this
  repo greps rendered text for a substring, so a *phantom extra column* (`NUM(8,2)` used to
  create a column literally named `2`) sailed through every `LIST`/`LIST STRUCTURE` check.
  Assert **exact** structure — column lists, record counts — with `toEqual`/`toHaveLength`
  wherever you can. `tests/DemoSchemas.test.ts` pins the demo tables for exactly this reason.
- **Test the surface, not the happy path through it.** Four of twelve `ClientMessage` types
  had zero tests; `grid-edit` wrote straight to SQLite with no validation and nobody noticed,
  because the grid tests only opened the grid and pressed Escape. Every WS message type
  should have a test that drives it and asserts the database/UI effect
  (`tests/GridMessages.test.ts`).
- **Green CI does not mean correct.** The cross-database `ColumnMetaStore` leak shipped with
  seven passing tests, because they all used a single database. When state is keyed by name,
  write the test that uses two.
- **Prefer failing loudly to guessing.** The parser used to absorb any token it didn't
  understand and invent a column from it. `CREATE TABLE` is now strict; keep it that way.
- **`toContainText` / `toBeVisible` do not see clipping.** The BROWSE validation message was
  present, styled `visible`, and clipped to nothing by the cell's `overflow: hidden` — users
  saw a red border and no reason, while the tests passed. Assert `toBeInViewport()` (backed by
  an IntersectionObserver, so it accounts for ancestor clipping) for anything that must be
  *readable*, and look at a screenshot of a UI change before believing it works.

Run `npm run coverage` when touching an area you suspect is untested. **Never run `npm test`
and `npx playwright test` concurrently** — both mutate `data/` and `data/system.sqlite3`, and
a state-dependent e2e test will fail for reasons that have nothing to do with your change.

## Definition of done

Complete these steps **in order** — do not skip or reorder:

1. **Branch correctly** — work sits on a `feature/<name>` branched off the milestone's `release/vX.Y.Z`; the PR is based on that release branch, **not** `main` (see Git conventions → GitFlow). Confirm the issue is assigned to the matching milestone.
2. `npm test` (vitest) **and** `npx playwright test` (e2e) both pass — all green.
   - **Every user-facing command/feature ships with a Playwright e2e case in the same PR, not just a vitest unit/integration test.** A REPL command needs at least one `tests/*.spec.ts` case that types it and asserts the rendered terminal/UI result; browser-only behavior (downloads, uploads, grid, wizards) must be exercised in a real browser. Unit coverage alone is not "done" — the #4 built-ins shipped broken because only unit tests (which bypass the parser) covered them.
   - **Assistant parity.** Every new user-facing command/feature is surfaced in the Assistant sidebar (a `CATEGORIES` action in `src/ui/Assistant.ts` and/or a wizard) **and** ships with a Playwright e2e case that clicks the Assistant action (or drives its wizard) and asserts the rendered REPL/UI result — OR the PR explicitly notes why the command does not belong in the Assistant (e.g. BROWSE already covers it, or it is not GUI-shaped). A vitest test does not satisfy this; the Assistant path must run in a real browser.
   - **CI gates this.** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs a `unit` job (vitest + build) and an `e2e` job (Playwright, auto-starting the dev server via the `webServer` block in `playwright.config.ts`) on every push/PR to `main` and `release/**`. A PR is not mergeable until both jobs are green — do not merge a release-branch PR with red or missing CI.
3. `package.json` version = the milestone's version (set on the `release/vX.Y.Z` branch); patch bumps for hotfixes
4. `CHANGELOG.md` — add entry (Added / Fixed / Changed sections) under the milestone version heading
5. `README.md` — command tables and feature list reflect what was built
6. `CLAUDE.md` — architecture, command tables, and roadmap updated
7. Screenshots — retake and commit if the UI changed (`docs/screenshots/`)
8. Any design doc in `docs/superpowers/` — mark completed items, note deviations
9. **Tag only on release** — `vX.Y.Z` is tagged when the `release/vX.Y.Z` branch merges to `main`, not on the feature branch.

Version scheme: 0.1.0 foundation → 0.2.0 indexing → 0.3.0 language completeness → 0.4.0 multi-work-area → 0.5.0 report engine → 0.6.0 assistant → 1.0.0 feature-complete (parity milestone) → 1.1.0+ beyond-parity. Versions are milestone-driven: each milestone ships on its own `release/vX.Y.Z` branch (see Git conventions).
