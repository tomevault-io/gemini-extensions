## What Hover is

Hover is a Vite plugin (later: a Chrome extension) that injects a floating chat widget into the user's dev server page. The developer types natural-language instructions ("test the login flow"), an agent drives their *actual* Chrome via CDP + Playwright MCP, and the verified session can be one-click crystallized into a standard Playwright `.spec.ts` file under `__vibe_tests__/`.

The differentiator vs. Stagehand / Midscene / Playwright codegen is the **AI exploration → deterministic script** workflow: AI authors the test, but the saved artifact is plain `@playwright/test` code that runs in CI without an agent in the loop.

## Workspace directories

Workspace packages come from `pnpm-workspace.yaml`: `packages/*` and `examples/*`. The repo is pnpm + ESM throughout.

- `packages/core` is `@hover-dev/core` — the Node service. Owns agent invocation, Playwright CDP preflight, MCP config, and the WebSocket bridge between the injected UI and the agent process.
- `packages/widget-bootstrap` is `@hover-dev/widget-bootstrap` — host-agnostic helper that owns the four widget source files (`template.html`, `style.css`, `client.js`, `reducer.js`), the mtime-keyed read cache, and the script-bundle assembly. Exposes three layers (`getWidgetScript` / `buildWidgetBundle` / `readWidgetAssets`) so the Vite plugin and any future bundler plugin (webpack, Next, Astro) all emit a byte-identical widget.
- `packages/transform-source` is `@hover-dev/transform-source` — **private workspace package, never published to npm** (`private: true`). Owns the per-framework source-attribution transforms that stamp `data-hover-source="<rel-path>:<line>:<col>"` onto every host element in user code: `transformJsx` (Babel parser, covers React / Solid / Preact), `transformVue` (`@vue/compiler-sfc`, filters via `tagType === ELEMENT_TYPE_HOST` so PascalCase + kebab-case components are skipped), `transformSvelte` (`svelte/compiler`'s `parse({ modern: true })`, gates on `type === 'RegularElement'` so `Component` / `SvelteHead` / `TitleElement` are skipped), and `transformAstro` (`@astrojs/compiler`, async because the underlying parser is WASM-backed; filters via `type === 'element'` so PascalCase components AND kebab-case custom-elements are both skipped). All four report the `<` character's 1-indexed line + column for cross-framework consistency. **Distributed by inlining**: each of the 5 integration shims (vite/astro/nuxt/next/webpack) runs `tsup` with `noExternal: ['@hover-dev/transform-source']`, so the transform code lands inside the shim's own `dist/` and the published bundle has no bare `@hover-dev/transform-source` import. Consumers `pnpm add` only the shim. The transform-source npm-side deps (`@babel/*`, `@vue/compiler-sfc`, `svelte`, `@astrojs/compiler`, `magic-string`) get promoted into each shim's `dependencies` so they resolve normally at install time. Package is itself `main: dist/index.js` (dist-shape) because Node's strict ESM resolver can't follow `./types.js` imports back to on-disk `.ts` — same fix used by `@hover-dev/core` and `@hover-dev/widget-bootstrap`. Root postinstall builds it on fresh clone.
- `packages/vite-plugin` is `vite-plugin-hover` — the Vite plugin shim. Consumes `@hover-dev/widget-bootstrap` for the widget injection and `@hover-dev/core` for the service. Builds with `tsup` so it can `noExternal` the private `@hover-dev/transform-source` into its dist. The plugin's `transform` hook dispatches by extension: `.jsx`/`.tsx` → JSX, `.vue` → Vue SFC, `.svelte` → Svelte 5, `.astro` → Astro. `enforce: 'pre'` is load-bearing — it puts us before `@vitejs/plugin-react` / `vue` / `svelte` transforms, which would otherwise collapse JSX/templates into render-function calls and leave no host-tag AST to walk. Must be a no-op in production builds (`apply: 'serve'`).
- `packages/astro-integration` is `@hover-dev/astro` — Astro integration shim. Astro's HTML pipeline for `.astro` pages bypasses user Vite plugins' `transformIndexHtml` output (verified empirically — `vite-plugin-hover` boots its service via `configureServer` but the widget script gets dropped), so this package wraps the same core service + widget bundle behind Astro's `injectScript('page', ...)` integration API. Source attribution is wired in two coordinated steps: (1) `updateConfig({ vite: { plugins: [...] } })` registers our `hover:source-attribution` Vite sub-plugin, but Astro's internal `astro:build` plugin claims `enforce:'pre'` first and our plugin lands AFTER it in the chain (tracked: withastro/roadmap#120); (2) `astro:server:setup` then re-sorts `server.config.plugins` to move ours to index 0. Even at index 0, **Vite's `transform()` hook still sees the already-compiled JS** because `astro:build` does the compile in its `load()` step — so for `.astro` files we intercept at `load()`: read the raw file from disk, run `transformAstro` (parse → mutate AST → serialize round-trip via `@astrojs/compiler`), and return the stamped source. Astro's load then sees our stamped output and compiles it normally. `.jsx`/`.tsx`/`.vue`/`.svelte` continue through `transform()` because they don't have an upstream `load()` step. This is unsupported maintenance-wise — Astro can break it on any minor by changing its plugin internals; the workaround is documented as a known limitation in the README. Active only on `astro dev`.
- `packages/nuxt-integration` is `@hover-dev/nuxt` — Nuxt module shim. Nuxt renders HTML through Nitro (not Vite), so Vite's `transformIndexHtml` is a no-op for Nuxt SSR/SSG responses (nuxt/nuxt#19853 — the maintainers chose this by design). This module uses `@nuxt/kit`'s `defineNuxtModule` + pushes the widget into `nuxt.options.app.head.script` (`tagPosition: 'bodyClose'`, `type: 'module'`), which Nitro renders inline into the SSR'd HTML. Source attribution is wired via `@nuxt/kit`'s `addVitePlugin()` — Nuxt's Vite chain is independent of any user-installed `vite-plugin-hover`, so the same source-attribution sub-plugin from the astro shim is registered separately here. Active only when `nuxt.options.dev === true`.
- `packages/next-integration` is `@hover-dev/next` — Next.js (App Router) integration shim. Next 16 ships Turbopack as the default bundler and Turbopack does not load webpack plugins, so `webpack-plugin-hover` only covers `next dev --webpack`; this package is the Turbopack-native path. Three pieces: (a) `withHover(nextConfig, opts)` — pure config wrapper, no side effects, serialises `opts` onto `process.env` so the runtime side can read them back; (b) `register()` from `@hover-dev/next/instrumentation` — boots the Hover service inside Next's official `instrumentation.ts` hook, which fires for `next dev` / `next start` but **not** `next build` (the reason we do NOT boot in `withHover` itself — `next.config.ts` is loaded at build time too, and a side-effect boot there would leak an orphan service into CI); (c) `<HoverScript />` — Server Component rendered after `{children}` in `app/layout.tsx`, emits a raw `<script type="module" dangerouslySetInnerHTML=…>` carrying the inlined widget bundle. Cross-file coordination uses env vars: `withHover` writes options to `__HOVER_NEXT_*`, the running service publishes its actual port to `__HOVER_NEXT_RESOLVED_PORT` after auto-bump, and `<HoverScript />` reads it back. Active only when `process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'` AND `process.env.NEXT_RUNTIME === 'nodejs'` — the Edge runtime is unsupported because the service depends on `ws` + `cross-spawn` + `playwright-core`. **Plugin manifests (`@hover-dev/security`, future third-party plugins) go through `register()`'s second argument as a `PluginSpec[]` — either a bare module-specifier string `'@hover-dev/security'` or a `{ module, options }` object — NOT through `withHover()`'s options or via a `vite-plugin-hover`-style varargs slot on the config wrapper.** Two reasons we don't accept manifests at the config / wrapper layer: (1) `HoverOptions` is env-var-serialised across the `withHover` ↔ `register` boundary and manifests carry closures / hook functions that don't survive JSON; (2) a top-level `import securityMode from '@hover-dev/security'` in `instrumentation.ts` would be statically traced by Turbopack into the Edge bundle, pulling in mockttp / playwright-core / etc. and breaking the Edge build. Inside `register-node.ts` we resolve each specifier via the same `new Function('s','return import(s)')` opaque-import trick that `instrumentation.ts` uses to reach `register-node` itself — Turbopack can't fold a `new Function`-built specifier into its trace, so plugin packages stay Node-runtime-only. The CLI's `add` mutator does NOT auto-wire any plugin into `instrumentation.ts`; users opt in by hand-editing the `register()` call (see `examples/next-app/instrumentation.ts` for the reference shape). **Source attribution** under Next is wired via `turbopack.rules['*.{jsx,tsx}']` (also honoured by `next dev --webpack`) pointing at a `dist/source-loader.js` entry that runs `transformJsx`. We deliberately do NOT port the JSX visitor to a Rust SWC plugin: Turbopack natively accepts webpack-style loaders, the loader runs in Node at negligible cost for a one-attribute stamp, and a real SWC plugin is a 3–5 week engineering project once you account for ABI pinning + Turbopack-specific bugs. Vue/Svelte/Astro extensions are NOT routed here on purpose — Next doesn't natively handle those file shapes.
- `packages/webpack-plugin` is `webpack-plugin-hover` — webpack 5 plugin shim. Covers vanilla `webpack-dev-server`, Rspack / Rsbuild (HtmlWebpackPlugin-compatible), and legacy CRA / Vue CLI via their plugin escape hatches. **Does NOT cover Next.js by default**: Next 16+ ships Turbopack as the default bundler and Turbopack does not load webpack plugins; users have to opt into `next dev --webpack`. The Turbopack-native path is `@hover-dev/next` above. Taps `HtmlWebpackPlugin.getHooks(compilation).alterAssetTagGroups` to push a `<script type="module">` into `bodyTags`; falls back to a `processAssets` HTML splice when html-webpack-plugin isn't present. Source attribution ships as a separate `dist/loader.js` entry (exported at `./loader`); `apply()` resolves the absolute path and unshifts a `module.rules` entry with `test: /\.(jsx|tsx|vue|svelte|astro)$/` + `enforce: 'pre'` so the stamp lands before any framework compiler runs. Verified gotcha: `compiler.options.watch` is still `false` when `apply()` runs under `webpack serve` (wds flips it later), so the plugin defers service-boot to the `watchRun` compiler hook — that hook only fires in watch/serve mode, so a one-shot `webpack --mode development` build correctly doesn't spawn an orphan service.
- `packages/cli` is `@hover-dev/cli` — the zero-install setup CLI. Exposed as the `hover` bin once published. `npx @hover-dev/cli add` reads the user's `package.json` to pick the right Hover integration (Vite / Astro / Nuxt / Next / Webpack via `FRAMEWORKS` registry in `frameworks.ts`), sniffs their lockfile to pick the right package manager (pnpm / yarn / bun / npm), spawns the install command, then uses [magicast](https://github.com/unjs/magicast) to AST-mutate the user's bundler config (`vite.config.ts` / `astro.config.mjs` / `nuxt.config.ts` / `next.config.ts` / `webpack.config.js`). Supports `--vite` / `--astro` / `--nuxt` / `--next` / `--webpack` flags to force a specific framework, plus `--dry-run`. Mutators are **idempotent** — running it twice on the same project no-ops the second time. Next is the only framework whose mutator touches two files (wraps `next.config.*` in `withHover(...)` AND creates / merges an `instrumentation.ts` at the project root or under `src/`); it deliberately does NOT auto-edit `app/layout.tsx` because AST-mutating user JSX invites whitespace drift, so the `<HoverScript />` step is printed as a manual one-liner. Detection priority places `next` above `webpack` so a Next project gets routed to `@hover-dev/next` rather than the (Turbopack-incompatible) webpack plugin. Magicast gotcha: `cfg[key] ??= []` doesn't work on the proxy (the proxy returns a non-undefined value for missing keys, short-circuiting the nullish-assign and leaving subsequent pushes detached from the AST); use the explicit `ensureArray()` helper which only assigns when truly absent.
- `examples/basic-app` is the minimal Vite + React app used as the default smoke target — login + counter + todos. Vite port 5173.
- `examples/e-commerce` is an Amazon-style e-commerce SPA: product grid (with category sidebar + search) → product detail → cart → checkout (shipping address + payment method) → success. Payment method offers an inline card form OR a "Pay with PayHover" button that opens the payment-provider in a new tab and listens for the postMessage result. Stresses long action chains, cart state, conditional UI per payment method, and cross-tab popup flows. Vite port 5174.
- `examples/stock-registration` is a realistic brokerage account opening form (think IBKR / Schwab account application). 8 sections, ~50 fields, conditional reveals (foreign-tax fields when not US tax resident, previous address when current < 2 years, employer block when employed/self-employed, PEP/FINRA/control-person follow-ups, ACH bank fields when funding via ACH), multi-select chips, file upload, range slider, compliance acknowledgements. Stresses AI form filling on rich realistic-business controls. Vite port 5175.
- `examples/canvas-paint` is a drawing app: `<canvas>` for the artwork, DOM toolbar for tools/color/brush size. Stresses AI's ability to find DOM controls amidst graphical content (canvas pixels are opaque to Playwright snapshots). Vite port 5176.
- `examples/payment-provider` is a **deliberately unintegrated** mock third-party payment page used as the popup target for e-commerce's "Pay with PayHover" button. Vite port 5177. **Does NOT install `vite-plugin-hover`** — the widget must not appear on the simulated third-party origin. Stresses agent behaviour around cross-tab flows: agent must `browser_tabs(action='list')` to discover the new tab, `browser_tabs(action='select')` to switch, operate the page without a widget, and verify the original tab advances on `window.opener.postMessage` callback.
- `examples/astro-app` is the minimal Astro dogfood — single page with a counter + todo list, served via `astro dev`. Uses `@hover-dev/astro` (NOT `vite-plugin-hover`) because Astro drops user Vite plugins' `transformIndexHtml` output. Verifies that the integration-based path produces byte-equivalent widget content. Astro port 5178; service auto-bumps from 51789 like the others.
- `examples/nuxt-app` is the minimal Nuxt 4 dogfood — single `app.vue` with a counter + todo list, served via `nuxt dev`. Uses `@hover-dev/nuxt` because Nuxt's Nitro SSR pipeline bypasses Vite's `transformIndexHtml` entirely. Verifies that the module + `app.head.script` path produces byte-equivalent widget content. Nuxt port 5179; service auto-bumps from 51789. Sets `compatibilityVersion: 4` explicitly so a future Nuxt major doesn't silently shift behaviour.
- `examples/next-app` is the minimal Next.js 16 App Router dogfood — `app/page.tsx` (counter + todos, client component) + `app/layout.tsx` (Server Component embedding `<HoverScript />`) + `instrumentation.ts` (calls `registerHover()`) + `next.config.ts` (wraps export with `withHover`). Served via `next dev` (Turbopack default, no `--webpack`). Verifies the three-piece integration (config wrapper + instrumentation register + RSC script tag) produces byte-equivalent widget content to the Vite / Astro / Nuxt / Webpack outputs. Next port 5182; service auto-bumps from 51789.
- `examples/webpack-app` is the minimal vanilla webpack 5 + `webpack-dev-server` dogfood — single `src/main.js` (plain JS, no React / Babel / TypeScript on purpose) with a counter + todo list. Uses `webpack-plugin-hover` + `HtmlWebpackPlugin`. Verifies the `alterAssetTagGroups`-injection path produces byte-equivalent widget content to the Vite / Astro / Nuxt outputs. Webpack-dev-server port 5180; service auto-bumps from 51789.
- `examples/rn-web-app` is the React Native Web dogfood — Vite + React 19 + `react-native-web@0.21+`, with a one-line `react-native` → `react-native-web` Vite alias so the app's `View / Text / TextInput / Pressable` imports resolve to DOM-rendering implementations. Uses `vite-plugin-hover` (same as basic-app etc. — RN Web is just a Vite + React project at the bundler layer). Exists to make explicit what's in and out of scope: **RN Web = yes**, **RN native = no** (no DOM, no CDP, no Playwright — would be a separate product). Vite port 5181. Local `src/react-native.d.ts` is a minimal type shim covering only the components this example uses (avoids pulling in `@types/react-native` which is the native-runtime types and would diverge from RN Web's actual DOM behaviour).

Each example's Hover plugin/integration instance (`vite-plugin-hover` for the Vite examples including `rn-web-app`, `@hover-dev/astro` for `astro-app`, `@hover-dev/nuxt` for `nuxt-app`, `@hover-dev/next` for `next-app`, `webpack-plugin-hover` for `webpack-app`) starts its own Hover service. The first one to boot binds `127.0.0.1:51789`; subsequent ones auto-bump (51790, 51791, …, up to 51798). The injected widget reads `window.__HOVER_PORT__` so each example's widget connects only to its own service — running multiple examples concurrently is supported and each writes skills + specs into its own `devRoot`. `payment-provider` has no service at all.

## Inactive or placeholder directories

- `__vibe_tests__/` is the write target for crystallized Playwright specs. The directory is created by the runtime; do not hand-author placeholder files there.

## Repository status

Phase 0 (end-to-end feasibility) is verified — a `claude -p` invocation, sandboxed to only the Playwright MCP server, successfully drives the user's Chrome through a multi-step task in `examples/basic-app`. Phase 1 (Vite plugin + chat UI + persistent Node service) is the active work.

Development order is Phase 0 → 1 → 2 → 3. Phase 1 work order: WebSocket server in `@hover-dev/core` → real Vite plugin injection (`transformIndexHtml` + Shadow DOM widget) → "save as Playwright spec" file emission.

# Architecture

## Local CLI Agent First

Hover bundles no AI runtime. It spawns whatever coding-agent CLI the user already has on PATH (`claude`, `codex`, ...) and normalizes its output into a single event stream.

Supported agents today: `claude` (Claude Code, hard sandbox) and `codex` (OpenAI Codex CLI, soft sandbox). Service auto-detects the primary at startup — first installed in registry order — so a user with only `codex` installed gets Hover working without env vars. The widget shows the current agent as a pill in its header and lets the user pick another from a dropdown that also lists registered-but-not-installed agents (greyed out, with an install hint copy-pasteable from the row).

Files in `packages/core/src/agents/`:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `types.ts` | `AgentDescriptor`, `InvokeOptions`, normalized `InvokeEvent`, `SandboxStrength`, `AgentDisplay`, protocol/format enums, error classes |
| `registry.ts` | `AGENTS` constant + `listAgents()` — single source of truth for supported agents |
| `detect.ts` | `detectAgents()`, `pickPrimaryAgent()`, `listAgentAvailability()`, `resolveBinForAgent()`, `resolveOnPath()` — PATH scanning + selection |
| `argv.ts` | `buildArgv()` — protocol-aware argv construction |
| `invoke.ts` | `invokeAgent()` — async-iterable: spawn child, parse stream, yield normalized events; calls descriptor's optional `onStreamEnd` to synthesize `session_end` for agents whose protocol lacks an explicit terminator (codex) |
| `claude.ts` | Claude Code descriptor — `claude -p`, stream-json parser, hard sandbox via `--strict-mcp-config` + `--allowedTools` + `--disallowedTools` |
| `codex.ts` | OpenAI Codex descriptor — `codex exec --json`, JSONL parser, soft sandbox via `--sandbox read-only` + `developer_instructions` system prompt (codex has no built-in-tool deny list at the CLI level) |

Per-agent strategy lives in its own file. To add a new agent: write its `AgentDescriptor` and register it in `registry.ts` — nothing else changes.

`AgentDescriptor.sandboxStrength` (`'hard' | 'soft'`) is the load-bearing field that lets `service.ts` decide whether to pass the claude-style allow/disallow lists (no-op for codex, but cleaner to gate at the service layer). A `'soft'` agent gets a ⚠ badge in the widget dropdown so the user knows the built-in tool surface (`shell`, `fs_edit`, etc.) is broader than the MCP-only locked-down `'hard'` agents.

The full flow for one command: page UI → WebSocket → `@hover-dev/core` → spawn agent → MCP → Playwright → CDP → user's Chrome. Step events flow back the same path in reverse.

## Widget-driven Chrome lifecycle

The widget knows the page it's running in (`window.location.href`). The service knows which Chrome it can reach over CDP (`/json/list`). Comparing the two answers a question the user shouldn't have to: "is this widget actually in the debug Chrome?" Three answers:

| State | Meaning | Widget UI |
|---|---|---|
| `same-window` | Origin matches a CDP tab. Agent can drive this very tab. | Normal blue ✨, full UI |
| `wrong-window` | A debug Chrome exists, but this widget isn't in it. | Gray ✨, panel says "use the other window"; click → service runs `Page.bringToFront()` on the matching tab |
| `no-cdp` | No debug Chrome at all. | Amber ✨, panel says "launch debug Chrome"; click → service runs `launchDebugChrome()` |

Wire protocol additions (client → server): `check-cdp { pageUrl }`, `launch-chrome { pageUrl }`, `focus-debug { pageUrl }`. Server → client: `cdp-status { state, launching?, reason?, browser?, matchingTabUrl? }`. Widget fires `check-cdp` on every WS open (including reconnects after HMR).

Origin comparison (not full-URL) is deliberate — the user might be on `/login` while the debug Chrome tab is on `/`; they're the same app and the agent can route within it.

The Vite plugin's `autoLaunchChrome` option (default `false`) pre-warms a debug Chrome at `vite dev`. The widget's on-demand launching makes the default `false` safe — users who do nothing still get guided to a working state on first ✨ click. Examples in this monorepo opt in (`autoLaunchChrome: true`) to keep `pnpm smoke` etc. one-step.

## Boundary constraints

These are load-bearing — several are non-obvious:

- The **agent** never launches its own Chromium — it connects to whatever debug Chrome is on `chromeDebugPort` via `connectOverCDP` and picks the existing context/page whose URL matches the dev-server origin. The agent's Playwright MCP is sandboxed to a CDP target it can't change.
- The **service** is allowed to spawn one specific Chrome: the isolated debug Chrome under `<tmpdir>/hover-chrome` via `launchDebugChrome()` (in `playwright/launchChrome.ts`). This happens either at Vite startup (when `autoLaunchChrome: true`) or on widget demand (when the user clicks an amber ✨). It is *not* the user's primary Chrome profile.
- Sandboxing is per-agent. For `claude` (hard sandbox), the service passes `--strict-mcp-config`, `--permission-mode dontAsk`, `--allowedTools mcp__playwright`, `--disallowedTools "Bash Edit Write Read Grep Glob Task WebFetch WebSearch …"`. The Playwright MCP server is the only tool Claude can reach; filesystem access (other than the `__vibe_tests__/` write path) is forbidden. For `codex` (soft sandbox), there is no equivalent CLI flag to disable built-in tools — we pass `--sandbox read-only --ask-for-approval never` and inject a strict `developer_instructions` system prompt telling the agent to use only `mcp__playwright__*`. The widget marks soft-sandbox agents with a ⚠ badge so users know the surface is broader.
- Default model is `sonnet`, not `opus`. Opus is ~5× more expensive per browser-driving session. Override with `HOVER_MODEL=opus` if needed for harder tasks.
- The injected UI lives in a Shadow DOM and marks itself with `data-vibe-test="true"` so Playwright can skip it. Tailwind's default scan does not work inside Shadow DOM — use inline styles or CSS-in-JS.
- The local Node service binds to `127.0.0.1` only. The Vite plugin must be a no-op in production builds (`apply: 'serve'` in `vite-plugin-hover`).
- Generated Playwright code prefers `page.getByRole` / `page.getByText` over CSS/XPath selectors.
- Cookies / localStorage never transit the Node service; auth state stays inside the browser and is handled by Playwright in-process.
- Child-process stdio must be drained, or the spawned agent deadlocks.
- WebSocket reconnect must be robust because Vite HMR will tear down the page repeatedly during normal dev.
- Output is standard `@playwright/test` files. No proprietary test format.

## Billing risk (active)

Starting **2026-06-15**, `claude -p` calls draw from a new monthly Agent SDK credit pool separate from interactive limits. Pro: $20, Max 5x: $100, Max 20x: $200. Overage flows to API rates if usage credits are enabled, otherwise hard cutoff until refresh. Two mitigations are already in place:

1. `--max-budget-usd` ceiling per invocation (currently $0.50 in `smoke.ts`). Claude-only — codex doesn't accept this flag.
2. Local CLI Agent First — `codex` is wired (v0.3.0). Users can switch agents from the widget dropdown if `claude` becomes expensive for them, with no env-var dance. `cursor-agent`, `aider`, `gemini-cli` etc. remain one-file additions to `registry.ts`.

# Development workflow

## Environment baseline

- Runtime is Node 24+, pnpm 10+. The repo is ESM throughout. No CJS at the source layer.
- `tsconfig.base.json` at the root is the shared TS config every package extends. There is no root `tsconfig.json` — typecheck runs per-package via `pnpm typecheck`.
- Test stack: Vitest for unit tests (per-package, under `packages/*/tests/`), Playwright dogfooding for integration (crystallized specs under `examples/basic-app/__vibe_tests__/`). No linter or formatter is configured yet.

## Package entry-point conventions (Next-tax)

Most Hover packages set `main` / `exports` directly to `src/*.ts`, so consumers' transpilers (Vite, esbuild via Astro / Nuxt / Webpack, tsx for `pnpm smoke`) see TypeScript source with zero build step — the dev loop is "edit `.ts` → HMR." This works because every consumer pipeline in the repo *transpiles* what it imports.

**Exceptions: `@hover-dev/core` and `@hover-dev/widget-bootstrap`** point `main` / `exports` at `dist/*.js`, and ship a `dev: tsc --watch` script. Reason: `@hover-dev/next` consumes them via `await import(...)` from inside Next's `instrumentation.ts`, and Next 16's Turbopack resolver does not rewrite NodeNext-style `.js` import specifiers back to the on-disk `.ts` files inside transitively-traced source packages (open issue [vercel/next.js#82945](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/82945) — `webpack`'s `resolve.extensionAlias` has no Turbopack equivalent). Switching those two packages to `dist`-entry shape is what lets a fresh-clone monorepo dev loop work for `examples/next-app` under default Turbopack.

**Practical implications:**

- A root `postinstall` hook (in the top-level `package.json`) runs `pnpm --filter @hover-dev/core --filter @hover-dev/widget-bootstrap build` after every `pnpm install`. Fresh clones get usable `dist/` artefacts before anyone touches an example.
- `pnpm dev:example:next-app` spawns `concurrently` with three watchers in parallel: `tsc --watch` for core, `tsc --watch` for widget-bootstrap, and `next dev` itself. Edits to `packages/core/src/service.ts` re-emit `packages/core/dist/service.js` in ~500 ms, Next picks up the changed `dist` file and HMRs the page. Cold start (initial build + Next boot) is ~5 s.
- Other examples (Vite / Astro / Nuxt / Webpack / RN Web) still tolerate `src`-entry shape — their bundlers transpile on the fly — but they now consume those two packages via `dist` too. The `postinstall` guarantees `dist` exists; the watchers aren't running for those examples, so an edit to `core/src/` requires either a one-shot `pnpm --filter @hover-dev/core build` or a separate `pnpm --filter @hover-dev/core dev` terminal. For now this is acceptable since cross-package edits during example dev are rare.
- **Sunset plan:** once vercel/next.js#82945 ships, we should switch `@hover-dev/core` and `@hover-dev/widget-bootstrap` back to `src`-entry shape and delete the watcher dance from `dev:example:next-app`. Tracking comment lives in `packages/next-integration/src/withHover.ts`.

## Edge runtime isolation in `@hover-dev/next`

Next 16 compiles `instrumentation.ts` for *both* the Node.js and the Edge runtime, and statically traces every `import` (including `await import('...')` with a literal-string specifier) into the Edge bundle even when a `process.env.NEXT_RUNTIME === 'nodejs'` runtime guard would skip the code path. The Edge bundler then chokes on Node-only transitive deps — most notably `playwright-core`'s CJS `require('chromium-bidi/...')` and our `process.cwd` / `process.once` calls.

Two structural tricks defuse this:

1. **Split file.** Everything Node-shaped lives in `packages/next-integration/src/register-node.ts`; `instrumentation.ts` is a thin shell that does the runtime guard and forwards to `registerNode()`. Edge bundling stops at the `register-node.ts` boundary if we can keep its import statically opaque.
2. **String-variable indirection** in `instrumentation.ts`: `const specifier = './register-node.js'; await import(specifier)`. Turbopack's static tracer gives up on dynamic specifiers it can't fold to a literal, so `register-node.ts` (and its transitive `@hover-dev/core/service` chain) is left out of the Edge bundle entirely. The Node runtime resolves the variable at execution time and loads the full file.

If you ever need to add another `import` from inside `register-node.ts`, no special handling is required — the whole file is already on the Node-only side of the indirection.

## Local lifecycle

Two terminals on first run; once Chrome and Vite are up they stay running across many smoke loops:

1. `pnpm dev:example:basic-app` — basic-app at http://localhost:5173. Because the example sets `autoLaunchChrome: true`, this also spawns the debug Chrome (`--remote-debugging-port=9222`, isolated profile at `<tmpdir>/hover-chrome`) navigated to the dev URL. (Same for `dev:example:e-commerce` / `…:stock-registration` / `…:canvas-paint` on 5174 / 5175 / 5176.)
2. `pnpm smoke` — end-to-end: detect agents → CDP preflight → invoke `claude` → stream events.

Need the debug Chrome without a Vite example? `pnpm smoke:chrome` standalone-spawns it (same `<tmpdir>/hover-chrome` profile, idempotent).

Custom target / prompt:

```bash
pnpm smoke http://localhost:5173/ "log in, then add a todo named 'verify hover'"
```

Environment overrides:

```bash
HOVER_AGENT=claude HOVER_MODEL=sonnet HOVER_CDP=http://localhost:9222 pnpm smoke
```

## Git commit policy

- Use Conventional Commits. Format: `<type>(<scope>): <description>`.
- Common types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `chore`, `test`, `perf`.
- `<scope>` is the package or sub-area: `core`, `vite-plugin`, `example`, `agents`, `playwright`, `mcp`, `ci`, `deps`.
- Commit messages are written in **English**. Hover is a public open-source repo; contributors come from everywhere.
- The subject line is imperative, ≤72 characters, no trailing period.
- Conventional Commits is enforced at commit time by a husky `commit-msg` hook running `commitlint`. The hook installs on `pnpm install`. Do not bypass it with `--no-verify` unless you have explicit owner sign-off.
- Stage files explicitly by name. Do not use `git add -A` / `git add .` — this avoids accidentally committing secrets or large binaries.
- Never amend a previous commit unless explicitly requested. Create a new commit instead.
- Never force-push to `main`. Never skip hooks. Never modify git config.

## Branching policy

- `main` must stay runnable. Every commit pushed to `main` should, in theory, leave the basic flow (`pnpm install` → `pnpm typecheck` → `pnpm smoke`) intact. This is what makes `git bisect` meaningful.
- Speculative or exploratory work goes on a branch: `git checkout -b experiment/<name>` (e.g. `experiment/chrome-extension`). Commit messily; if it works merge to `main`, if not delete the branch.
- Feature work: `feat/<name>`. Bug fixes: `fix/<name>`.

## Milestone tags

Tag versions at meaningful milestones so the history has anchor points:

- `v0.0.1-poc` — Phase 0 (end-to-end feasibility) verified.
- `v0.1.0` — Phase 1 (Vite plugin + chat UI + persistent service) shipped.

## Test strategy

- Unit tests: **Vitest**, per-package, in `packages/*/tests/` sibling to `src/`. Run with `pnpm --filter @hover-dev/core test` or `pnpm test` at the root (which fans out across the workspace). Keep `src/` source-only; do not place `*.test.ts` inside `src/`. Current coverage: `packages/core/tests/agents/` (argv dispatcher, claude descriptor, registry).
- Integration / e2e: **Playwright dogfooding**. Crystallized specs land under `examples/basic-app/__vibe_tests__/` and run with standard `@playwright/test`. The agent must not be involved at CI time — only the Playwright script runs. Bootstrap on a fresh machine: `pnpm --filter basic-app exec playwright install chromium`. Run with `pnpm test:e2e`.
- Smoke-level end-to-end (agent in the loop): `pnpm smoke`. This requires a running debug Chrome and the example frontend; it is not part of CI.

## Validation strategy

Before marking work ready:

1. `pnpm typecheck` — fans out to every package.
2. `pnpm test` — Vitest, fans out across packages with tests.
3. The package-scoped smoke or Playwright run that matches the files changed.

# Common commands

# FAQ

## Why is the default model `sonnet` and not `opus`?

A typical browser-driving session with `opus` costs ~5× the equivalent `sonnet` session. Hover is meant to run continuously during dev; default to `sonnet`. Set `HOVER_MODEL=opus` per-invocation when you need it.

## Why does Hover use an isolated debug Chrome instead of attaching to the user's normal browser?

Hover launches its own debug Chrome under `<tmpdir>/hover-chrome` (a persistent user-data-dir, reused across runs) and connects to it over CDP. It deliberately does *not* attach to the user's primary Chrome profile: doing so would require the user to relaunch their everyday browser with `--remote-debugging-port` and would expose every tab, cookie, and extension on their main session to whatever the agent does. The trade-off is honest: the user has to log into the app once inside the debug Chrome, but from that point on the profile dir persists session state across Hover commands and dev-server restarts.

The CDP entry point (`connectOverCDP` against an *already-running* debug Chrome) is still load-bearing: the agent never spawns its own Chromium, never operates a fresh headless context, and always lands on the existing tab whose URL matches the dev-server origin.

## Why is filesystem access disallowed on the agent?

The agent only needs the Playwright MCP server — that is enough to drive the browser end-to-end. Allowing `Bash`, `Edit`, `Write`, `Read`, etc. dramatically widens the blast radius if the prompt is hijacked or if the agent hallucinates a destructive action. The single write path (eventually under `__vibe_tests__/`) is granted by the Node service, not by the agent's tool list.

## Why is the UI in a Shadow DOM?

Two reasons: (1) style isolation from the host app, so Hover's CSS does not bleed into the page under test, and (2) Playwright tests must be able to skip Hover's own DOM — the `data-vibe-test="true"` marker on the Shadow root makes the filter trivial. Tailwind's content scanner does not see inside Shadow DOM; use inline styles or CSS-in-JS.

## Why `--max-budget-usd 0.50`?

A safety belt against runaway prompts. Phase 0 sessions empirically complete a 5-step task on the example frontend for well under $0.10; $0.50 is generous but still catches a runaway loop before it becomes expensive. Tune up only with explicit reason.

## "ERR_REQUIRE_ESM" when loading `@hover-dev/security` under Next?

Symptom: `require() of ES Module .../get-port/index.js from .../mockttp/dist/server/mockttp-server.js not supported`. Chain is `@hover-dev/security` → `mockttp@4.4.2` → `require('get-port')` → `get-port@7.x` (ESM-only). `mockttp` upstream is aware — see [httptoolkit/mockttp#200](https://github.com/httptoolkit/mockttp/issues/200) (open as of 2026-05) — but ships no fix yet.

Workarounds, by preference:

1. **Upgrade to Node ≥ 22.12** — Node added sync `require(ESM)` in 22.12, so the load succeeds out of the box. `@hover-dev/security` declares `engines.node >= 22.12.0` for this reason. Older Node still emits the runtime error.
2. **Pin `get-port` to v6 in your project's overrides**:
   ```json
   { "pnpm": { "overrides": { "get-port": "^6.1.2" } } }
   ```
   (npm: `"overrides"` at top level; yarn: `"resolutions"`.) get-port@6.x is CJS and `mockttp`'s `require()` works.
3. **Remove the `@hover-dev/security` plugin from your `register()` call** if you don't need MITM mode — Hover works fine without it.

We can't fix this from inside `@hover-dev/security`: npm overrides only flow from the consumer's root package.json, so a published dep can't override a sibling dep's resolution.

## "Cannot get schema for 'PrivateKeyInfo' target" when enabling security mode?

Symptom: the widget reports `[hover/mitm] CA generation failed: @peculiar/asn1-schema schema-registry collision`. Root cause: `@peculiar/asn1-schema` keeps its ASN.1 schema definitions on a per-module-instance singleton. When two copies of the package end up in the consumer's `node_modules` (pnpm hoisting + Next 15's module-resolution combine produces this readily), PKI deps register schemas into copy A's registry but the runtime lookup walks copy B's empty one → schema not found.

`@hover-dev/security` declares `@peculiar/asn1-schema@2.6.0` as a direct dependency to give pnpm a strong hint, but inside the consumer's tree mockttp's own sub-deps may still pull in a sibling copy.

Fix from the consumer's root package.json:

```json
{ "pnpm": { "overrides": { "@peculiar/asn1-schema": "2.6.0" } } }
```

(npm: `"overrides"` at top level; yarn: `"resolutions"`.) Then `rm -rf node_modules && pnpm install` to collapse to one copy. Verify with `pnpm why @peculiar/asn1-schema` — should show exactly one resolved version.

The startProxy() loop now detects this exact error message and rewrites it into the fix recipe, so the widget panel shows a useful error instead of a generic `no free port` swallowed-error trail.
