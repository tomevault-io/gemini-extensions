# AGENTS.md

Orientation for AI agents working on this repo. Pair this with `README.md`
(end-user docs) and the source itself — the code is the source of truth.

## What this is

`symphony-linear` is a single-process Python daemon that orchestrates AI work on
Linear or GitHub issues (one backend per daemon instance). The loop:

1. Poll the tracker for issues with the trigger signal (label or project
   field, depending on backend).
2. For each new issue: clone the project's repo into a per-ticket workspace,
   switch to the ticket branch, optionally run `.symphony/setup`, then run
   `opencode run` inside a bubblewrap sandbox with the ticket title +
   description as the prompt.
3. Post the AI's final message as a comment and transition the ticket
   to the configured "needs input" state.
4. When a human comments, resume the OpenCode session with the new comment as
   user input, post the result, repeat.

There is no web UI, no API, no database. State lives in `state.json` in the
workspace dir. The only external services are the issue tracker (Linear or
GitHub, accessed via GraphQL) and OpenCode (launched as a subprocess inside
`bwrap`).

## Stack

- Python 3.11+, packaged with `hatchling` (see `pyproject.toml`).
- `uv` for dependency management (`uv.lock` is committed). The venv is at
  `.venv/` — use `.venv/bin/python` and `.venv/bin/pytest` directly.
- Runtime deps: `pyyaml`, `pydantic` v2, `httpx`.
- Dev deps: `pytest`.
- External binaries required at runtime: `bwrap`, `git`, `opencode`.
- CLI entry point: `symphony` → `symphony_linear.cli:main`.
- Backends: the orchestrator talks to a `Tracker` protocol (see `tracker.py`).
  Concrete implementations exist for Linear (`linear_tracker.py`) and
  GitHub Projects v2 (`github_tracker.py`). Exactly one backend is active
  per daemon, selected at config time.

## Layout

```
symphony_linear/
  cli.py            argparse + wiring; loads config, builds Orchestrator, runs it
  config.py         YAML + pydantic config; ~ and ${VAR} expansion; token fallback
  state.py          TicketState model + StateManager (atomic JSON writes, threading.Lock)
  tracker.py        Tracker-neutral protocol, errors, and enums (the seam for orchestrator)
  linear.py         Linear GraphQL client (httpx, sync); typed exceptions; Issue/Comment/Project models
  linear_tracker.py Linear backend adapter implementing the Tracker protocol
  github.py         GitHub GraphQL client (httpx, sync); typed exceptions
  github_tracker.py GitHub Projects v2 backend adapter implementing the Tracker protocol
  sandbox.py        Single function: run_in_sandbox() → builds the bwrap argv and returns a Popen
  opencode.py       run_initial / run_resume; parses OpenCode's NDJSON event stream
  workspace.py      prepare() / remove(): clone, branch switch, .symphony/setup; path-containment check
  orchestrator.py   The brain: poll loop, per-ticket pipelines, ThreadPoolExecutor, cancellation
  logging.py        stderr logging setup
tests/              pytest, mostly unit with mocks; integration tests marked `integration` (shell out to `bwrap`/`git` — they never call the real `opencode` binary or any LLM)
```

The flow worth knowing: `orchestrator._tick()` is called every
`poll_interval_seconds`. It fans out work via `_schedule_task()` onto a
5-worker `ThreadPoolExecutor`, with per-ticket serialization (a ticket only
gets one task in flight at a time). Subprocesses are tracked in
`_subprocesses` so they can be killed when a ticket is cleaned up (daemon
shutting down, or the ticket is no longer triggered — see `_is_still_triggered`).

## Key invariants and gotchas

- **TicketStatus is daemon-internal**, distinct from Linear workflow states.
  Don't conflate `TicketStatus.needs_input` (in `state.json`) with the Linear
  state named "Needs Input". The same applies to GitHub: the daemon's internal
  status is separate from the project's Status field value.
- **The daemon polls tickets in `in_progress_state`, `needs_input_state`, and
  (if configured) `qa_state`** (see `_fetch_triggered_issues`). When a human
  comments on a `needs_input` ticket, `_resume_pipeline` transitions it back
  to `in_progress` itself — users don't need to do that manually. Human
  comments on a ticket in `qa_state` also trigger the normal resume pipeline:
  the ticket is transitioned to `in_progress_state`, the agent runs, the
  ticket lands in `needs_input_state`, and the existing `_reconcile_serve`
  logic kills the active serve on the next tick because its owner left QA.
- **The bot's own comments are filtered out** via the bot user id (`viewer.id`
  cached on the client). New "human" comments = comments whose
  `user_id != bot_user_id`. The `bot_user_email` in the config exists for
  documentation; the actual matching is by id. GitHub uses the viewer's node
  id — the same filtering logic applies.
- **State entry exists ⟺ workspace exists.** `orchestrator._tick` step 3
  fires cleanup (cancel subprocesses, remove state entry, remove workspace)
  whenever a tracked ticket is no longer *triggered* — i.e. the trigger label
  is absent, the Linear state is no longer an active state, the ticket is
  archived, or the ticket was deleted. A re-trigger of the same ticket after
  cleanup is handled as a fresh `_new_ticket_pipeline` that reclones from scratch.
- **Path containment is a security invariant.** `workspace._check_containment`
  uses `os.path.realpath` on both sides; never bypass it.
- **State writes are atomic** (`tempfile` + `os.replace`). Don't rewrite
  `StateManager.save()` without preserving that.
- **The sandbox shares the network namespace** (the agent needs internet) but
  unshares user/pid/ipc/uts. Credential dirs (`~/.ssh`, etc.) are hidden via
  `--tmpfs` (dirs) or `--ro-bind /dev/null` (files/sockets). Git ops run
  *outside* the sandbox using the daemon's credentials; OpenCode and
  `.symphony/setup` run *inside*.
- **The OpenCode session id is captured from the first NDJSON event** that
  includes `sessionID`. The final assistant message is the concatenation of
  all `"text"` events. Other event types are intentionally ignored.
- **No auto-retry on failure.** A failed ticket goes to `TicketStatus.failed`
  and only retries if the user comments (resume path) or if there's no
  session id yet (re-runs the initial pipeline).
- **Setup errors are sticky.** `setup_error` is set when project/repo-link/
  workspace prep fails, and is cleared only when the user comments on the
  ticket. Don't clear it elsewhere.
- **QA serve is a global singleton, in-memory only.** When `linear.qa_state`
  (or `github.qa_status`) is configured and a ticket enters that state,
  `_reconcile_serve` runs the repo's `.symphony/serve` script in the sandbox
  and stores the Popen in `Orchestrator._active_serve` (an `_ActiveServe`
  dataclass). At most one serve runs across the whole daemon. The newest QA
  entrant always wins — incumbents are killed and bumped back to
  `needs_input_state`. Nothing about the serve is persisted to `state.json`;
  on daemon restart the reconciliation loop sees the ticket still in
  `qa_state` and relaunches the serve naturally. A serve that dies (within
  or after the 10s watchdog window) gets a tracker comment with the rc and a
  stdout/stderr tail, and the ticket is transitioned back to
  `needs_input_state` to avoid a respawn loop — except clean exits within
  10s, which are silent (the script is assumed to have daemonized a child).

## Running and testing

```bash
.venv/bin/pytest                              # full suite (unit + integration)
.venv/bin/pytest -m "not integration"         # unit only
.venv/bin/pytest tests/test_orchestrator.py   # one file
.venv/bin/python -m symphony_linear --validate-config --workspace <dir>
```

There is no linter configured. There is no Makefile. If you add tooling,
update this file.

Tests heavily use `unittest.mock`. Look at `tests/test_orchestrator.py` for
the patterns — fake `LinearClient`, mocked `run_initial`/`run_resume`,
`tmp_path` fixtures for state files. Integration tests under the
`integration` marker shell out to `bwrap` and `git`; they do **not** invoke
the real `opencode` binary or any LLM. Don't add tests that do — they're
flaky (model nondeterminism), costly (API calls), and exercise OpenCode's
behaviour, not ours. The NDJSON parser is unit-tested against a fixture.

## Conventions

- Code style follows what's there: explicit `from __future__ import annotations`,
  PEP 604 unions (`str | None`), module-level `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)`,
  typed exceptions per module (`LinearError`, `OpenCodeError`, `WorkspaceError`
  hierarchies). Don't reach for new frameworks.
- Pydantic v2 models for any structured data crossing module boundaries.
- Keep `sandbox.py` and `workspace.py` boring and side-effect-explicit. They're
  the security-sensitive parts.
- Logging is to `stderr` only, via the format set in `logging.py`. Don't add
  `print()` calls.
- Commit messages MUST follow Conventional Commits (https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).
  Common prefixes: `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`,
  `ci:`, `build:`, `perf:`, `style:`. Breaking changes: append `!` after type
  (`feat!: ...`) or add `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer. Release Please uses these
  to compute the next version — `fix:` → patch, `feat:` → minor, breaking →
  major.

## Knowledge and tickets

- **Gnosis (`gn` CLI)** records cross-cutting "why" knowledge. Run
  `gn help plan` before starting non-trivial work and `gn help review` after.
  Entries live in `.gnosis/entries.jsonl`. Prefer code comments when the
  context attaches to a specific line.
- **Tickets (`tk` CLI)** track work items in `.tickets/`. Statuses are
  `open`, `in_progress`, `closed` — there is no "needs input" status; that's a
  Linear concept, not a `tk` one. Use `tk ready` to see unblocked tickets and
  `tk dep tree <id>` to inspect dependencies.

## Things not to do

- Don't add `git push` from inside the sandboxed agent — credentials are
  deliberately hidden. Pushing is a human task.
- Don't widen the sandbox to bind extra host paths unless there's a clear
  reason; the credential-hiding logic depends on the current mount layout.
- Don't add retries/backoff to tracker API calls without thinking through the
  poll loop — the loop itself is the retry mechanism.
- Don't change `TicketStatus` values without a migration story for existing
  `state.json` files.
