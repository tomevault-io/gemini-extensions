# Rules for AI Agent

## Read First

Before ANY work, read these files in order:
1. `ARCHITECTURE.md` — code patterns, store API, file structure
2. `DESIGN_RULES.md` — game design quality principles

If they exist, also read:
3. `DESIGN.md` — this game's design (generated per project)
4. `TODO.md` — current task list (generated per project)

## Document Types

| File | Kind | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| `AGENTS.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `DESIGN_RULES.md` | **Rules** (permanent) | How to work, how to code, how to design |
| `DESIGN.md`, `TODO.md` | **Project docs** (generated) | What this specific game is and what to build |

Rules files define standards. Project docs are generated per game. Never confuse them.

## Guard Behavior

Before implementing any request, check it against `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `DESIGN_RULES.md`, and `DESIGN.md`.

### Architecture violation (code)
If the request breaks a rule from `ARCHITECTURE.md` (e.g. uses `Math.random()`, ES modules, direct state mutation from UI):
1. **STOP** — do not write code
2. **Name** the specific rule that would be violated
3. **Propose** 1–3 compliant alternatives
4. **Wait** for user to confirm before proceeding

### Design violation (game design)
If the request contradicts a principle from `DESIGN_RULES.md` (e.g. dominant strategy, slogan-only fun, missing goal hierarchy, PEGI violation):
1. **STOP** — do not modify `DESIGN.md` or write code
2. **Name** the specific principle that would be violated (quote it)
3. **Explain the consequences** — what will go wrong for the player if this change ships (e.g. "players will find the optimal boring strategy and stop engaging with other mechanics", "new players will have no clear goal for the first 10 minutes")
4. **Propose 3 alternatives** — different ways to achieve the user's intent without violating the principle. Each alternative should briefly explain how it solves both the user's goal and the design concern
5. **Wait** — do not proceed until the user picks an alternative or explicitly overrides the rule

If the user insists on the original request after seeing the warning, implement it — but add a comment in `DESIGN.md` next to the affected section noting which principle was intentionally overridden and why.

## Development Workflow

### Phase 1 → DESIGN.md
Read user's concept + `DESIGN_RULES.md`. Write `DESIGN.md` — a complete game design document. Validate against every design principle. Present for approval.

### Phase 2 → TODO.md
Read approved `DESIGN.md` + `ARCHITECTURE.md`. Write `TODO.md` — ordered, atomic tasks with references to design sections and affected files. Foundations first (config → systems → UI → polish). Present for approval.

### Phase 3 → Implementation
Execute `TODO.md` sequentially. Mark each task done. Verify `ARCHITECTURE.md` compliance after each task.

### Phase 4 → Testing
Write tests in `tests/` verifying: feature correctness against `DESIGN.md`, deterministic replay, architecture compliance. Run tests by opening `tests/index.html`. If any test fails — fix code, re-run all tests. Repeat until all pass.

---

## Iteration Workflow

When `DESIGN.md`, `TODO.md`, and working code already exist and the user requests a change (new feature, balance tweak, mechanic removal, etc.):

1. **Validate** — check the request against `DESIGN_RULES.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, and current `DESIGN.md`. If violated — follow the Guard Behavior procedure (stop, explain consequences, propose 3 alternatives, wait).
2. **Update DESIGN.md** — modify only the affected sections. Do not delete unrelated content. Validate the updated document against `DESIGN_RULES.md`. Present the changes for approval.
3. **Update TODO.md** — append new tasks for the change. Keep completed tasks marked as done — do not remove them. Present new tasks for approval.
4. **Implement** — execute new tasks sequentially. Mark done. Verify architecture compliance.
5. **Test** — update existing tests if behavior changed. Write new tests for new features. Run ALL tests (old and new). Fix failures, re-run until all pass.

**Never skip straight to code.** Every code change must trace back to an approved `DESIGN.md` update.

## Coding Rules

### 1. file:/// Compatibility (CRITICAL)
Game MUST work when opened via `file:///` in any modern browser:
- **NO ES modules** — `import`/`export` require HTTP server due to CORS. Forbidden.
- **NO build process** — no bundlers, transpilers, or package managers at runtime.
- **NO external dependencies** — all code is self-contained in `src/`.
- Load files via `<script>` tags in `index.html` in dependency order.
- Each `.js` file wraps code in an IIFE and assigns exports to `window`.

### 2. Global Export Pattern
Every source file:
```js
;(function() {
    'use strict'
    // ... implementation ...
    window.myModule = { /* public API */ }
})()
```

Config files:
```js
;(function() {
    'use strict'
    window.config = window.config || {}
    window.config.units = { /* data */ }
})()
```

### 3. Data Flow
- **UI** (`ui/`) — calls `store.dispatch()` and `store.subscribeTo()` only. No game logic, no state writes.
- **Handlers** (`store.register(type, fn)`) — mutate state directly. State is a plain mutable object.
- **Dispatch** only discrete events: inputs, spawns, deaths, pickups.
- **Continuous sim** — lives in `system.update()`, not in handlers.
- **Subscribers** — always store and call the unsubscribe function on cleanup.

### 4. Game Loop
- `store.tick()` — first call in each simulation step, once, in `main.js` only.
- Fixed timestep (`FIXED_DT`) if any system multiplies by `dt`.
- `main.js` orchestrates all `system.update()` calls.
- Inside `update()`, set flags in state; dispatch in the next tick.
- `render()` in `requestAnimationFrame` — no game logic.

Two kinds of state changes — never mix:

| Kind | Mechanism | Logged? | Examples |
|------|-----------|---------|----------|
| Discrete event | `dispatch()` | Yes | button press, death, spawn |
| Continuous sim | `system.update()` | No | movement, physics, AI tick |

### 5. Determinism
- `Math.random()` **forbidden**. Use `store.prng.next()`.
- `Date.now()` only in `main.js` for the session seed.
- `store.resetState(seed)` requires an explicit seed.
- Replay format: `{ seed, history }`.

### 6. Slice Subscriptions
- Prefer `store.subscribeTo(slice, fn)` over `store.subscribe(fn)`.
- Slice = dot-path into state: `"player.hp"` → `state.player.hp`.
- Declare slice in `store.register(type, handler, 'player.hp')`.
- One action = one slice. Mutating two slices → split into two actions.

### 7. Config vs State
- Static balance (HP, damage, prices) → `config/*.js`. Read-only at runtime.
- Changing values → `store.state`.
- Strings → `config/strings.js`.

### 8. File Decomposition
- One file = one state slice. `playerSystem.js` touches only `state.player`.
- Split at ~500 lines.

### 9. State Purity
`store.state` = only plain serializable data: numbers, strings, booleans, plain objects, arrays.
No DOM nodes, class instances, functions.

### 10. Code Simplicity
- Write for a junior developer. If it needs more than one sentence to explain — simplify.
- New action = 3 touch points: config entry + `register()` + `dispatch()`.
- Each action type registered in exactly one place. Each config value in exactly one file.
