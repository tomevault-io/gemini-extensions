# LGM GTM Skills — Claude setup

You are looking at the **GTM System repo** maintained by [La Growth Machine](https://lagrowthmachine.com). It bundles a library of public Claude skills (sourcing, list building, campaigns, copywriting, analytics, reply handling) and an MCP server that lets Claude act directly inside the user's LGM workspace.

## First-time setup

Check if the LGM MCP is already configured by running `claude mcp list` (look for a line starting with `LaGrowthMachine:`). The installer registers the MCP via `claude mcp add --scope user --transport http`, which stores the config in `~/.claude.json` at user scope (available in every project). If the `claude` CLI isn't available, ask the user whether they've already run `sh install.sh`.

**If it is NOT configured**, proactively tell the user:

> "I can see this is the LGM GTM Skills repo. Would you like me to install the LGM MCP and skills? It takes ~1 minute — I'll run `sh install.sh` for you. On first use, a browser tab opens to sign in to La Growth Machine (OAuth) — new accounts can be created from that tab. No API key to copy, nothing to paste."

If they say yes, run `sh install.sh` and confirm when done.

**If it IS configured**, present the onboarding to the user:

1. Confirm MCP is connected and list the available MCP tools grouped by category (Audiences, Campaigns, Inbox, Send, Workspace, LinkedIn, BigQuery).
2. List the available GTM Skills grouped by category.
3. Show the suggested first-steps table.
4. Ask: *"What would you like to do?"*

## What LGM gives you

Once the MCP is connected and skills are installed, two layers work together.

---

### Layer 1 — LGM MCP (Claude acts inside La Growth Machine)

The MCP gives Claude direct access to the user's LGM workspace. No copy-paste, no tab switching. Tools are exposed under the namespace `mcp__LaGrowthMachine__*`.

**Audiences**
- `create_audience_from_linkedin_url` — create an audience directly from a Sales Navigator search URL
- `get_audience` — fetch an existing audience by ID
- `get_audience_leads` — list all leads in an audience (paginated)

**Campaigns — read**

**Inbox / conversations — actions**

- `send_linkedin_message` — send a LinkedIn reply in a conversation
- `snooze_conversation` / `unsnooze_conversation` — snooze a thread for later
- `archive_conversation` / `unarchive_conversation` — archive / restore a thread

**Workspace**
- `list_workspaces` — list the workspaces the user has access to
- `list_members` — list the members of the current workspace
- `list_identities` — list all identities (LinkedIn accounts, email accounts)
- `save_identity_preference` — set a preferred identity for outreach

**LinkedIn**
- `get_linkedin_post` — fetch a LinkedIn post and its engagers (likers, commenters)

**BigQuery**
- `execute_bigquery_query` — run a BigQuery query against LGM data
- `get_bigquery_logs_guide` — get the guide to LGM's log schema (what tables and fields exist)

---

### Layer 2 — GTM Skills (published in this repo)

Skills guide Claude through complex GTM workflows. Just describe what you want. Skills are categorized into 4 outcomes mirroring the GTM motion:

**Fuel my pipeline** — sourcing, list building, ICP

- `sales-nav-search-builder` — turn a natural-language ICP into a precise LinkedIn Sales Navigator search URL, ready to import as an LGM audience
- `post-to-campaign` — turn a LinkedIn post into a ready-to-launch campaign: scrape the post's likers and commenters into an audience and fill a draft sequence
- `audience-icp-filter` — filter an existing audience against an ICP; sorts every lead into match / needs review / no match, strips your team and competitors, never silently drops anyone
- `won-deal-icp-finder` — audit your biggest closed-won deals to find your proven ICP and a look-alike target list

**Get qualified meetings** — campaigns, copywriting, sequences

- `multichannel-campaign-builder` — generate a complete LinkedIn + email sequence from a natural-language brief, and create it as a draft campaign in LGM
- `campaign-challenger` — benchmark a campaign copy against your existing campaigns, return prioritized fixes, and apply them back into the campaign
- `campaign-impact-analyzer` — rank campaigns by real revenue impact by cross-referencing LGM campaigns with HubSpot deals
- `weekly-performance-advisor` — build a two-tab weekly cockpit from your LGM data: replies to handle, campaigns to fix, and reply-volume trends
- `team-performance-dashboard` — rank each sender on reply rate, your success event and conversion, surface hot leads going cold, and clone your best reps' campaigns across the team

**Catch opportunities** — reply handling, intent detection

- `reply-draft-assistant` — triage your inbox or a campaign's replies, draft the right answer from the full thread, and send it in LGM on your approval

**Secure my channels** — channel health, deliverability, identities — *coming soon*

## Suggested first steps

Suggest one of these depending on what the user wants to do:

| They want to… | Suggest |
|---|---|
| Build a prospect list | Use `sales-nav-search-builder` |
| Sequence people who engaged with a LinkedIn post | Use `post-to-campaign` |
| Filter or segment an existing audience against an ICP | Use `audience-icp-filter` |
| Find their proven ICP from deals | Use `won-deal-icp-finder` |
| Write a campaign from scratch | Use `multichannel-campaign-builder` |
| Pressure-test a campaign before launch | Use `campaign-challenger` |

| See what to do this week / campaign health | Use `weekly-performance-advisor` |
| See per-rep team performance / who converts best | Use `team-performance-dashboard` |
| Handle or draft replies to their inbox | Use `reply-draft-assistant` |
| Pull live campaign data ad hoc | Call the MCP directly (e.g. `list_campaigns`, `get_campaign_stats`) |
| Run a custom analytics query | Call the BigQuery tools (`execute_bigquery_query`, `get_bigquery_logs_guide`) |

## Tone

Be direct and outcome-focused. LGM users are GTM and growth professionals — they want pipeline results, not feature explanations. Lead with what they can accomplish, not how the tools work.
