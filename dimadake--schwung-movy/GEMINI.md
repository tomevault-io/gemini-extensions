# CONVENTIONS.md — Movy

Movy is a Schwung **tool module** for Ableton Move. The UI (TypeScript →
`ui.js`) runs in the shadow-UI QuickJS context; it presents the active chain
slot's synth parameters on the 8 knobs and is also a **native-Move-style
4-track step sequencer**. The sequencer's musical engine is a **Rust DSP**
(`dsp.so`) that schwung loads as the co-running overtake DSP.

Device: `ableton@move.local`

**Plans:** Save all implementation plans to `movy/plans/` (not the repo root `plans/`).

## Aider setup

This repository is part of a parent `cld` workspace containing several related
repositories. Aider agents should treat sibling repos as **context only**, not
as files to edit unless the user explicitly asks and has added them to the chat.

- `../schwung` — the main Schwung runtime/shadow-UI host. This is the most
  important sibling: many host API facts in this file are sourced from
  `schwung/src/shadow/shadow_ui.js`.
- Other module repos may sit alongside `movy` under the same parent directory.
  Until they are listed in `.aider.conf.yml` (or added to the chat manually),
  aider does not see them.

If you need aider to include those sibling repositories in its repo-map, add
them to `.aider.conf.yml` under `read:`. Do not add broad `read:` globs that
pull in build artifacts or the sibling repos' own `.aider` files.

---

## Context discipline

A tool call is a full model turn — the whole conversation gets re-sent on
every one — so round-trip *count* is the cost, not output size. Optimize for
fewer calls, not smaller ones.

- **Batch independent shell calls into one message.** Firing them one at a
  time pays a full round trip each even when none depends on another's
  result.
- **Device work: one `ssh` round trip, not three.** The clear-log → act →
  check-log cycle run as three separate `ssh ableton@move.local` calls is the
  single most common device pattern in this repo's session history. Use
  `scripts/dev-probe.sh log` instead — it clears the log, optionally injects a
  MIDI event, polls for the pattern, and dumps matching lines inside one ssh
  call. `scripts/dev-probe.sh status` does the same for reachability + deployed
  `ui.js` md5 + log-enabled state.
- **Grep or read a line range before reading a whole file.** `Read` on an
  entire file is the most expensive call type per-invocation in this repo. If
  you're hunting one symbol, `grep -n` it first and read just that range.

---

## Sequencer (engine + UI)

The sequencer spans two layers; keep musical truth in the engine and only a
mirror in the UI.

- **Engine — `engine/` (Rust workspace):** `seq-core` (pure logic: clock,
  clips/notes, scheduler, recording, sessions, persistence — host-testable
  with `cargo test`) + `movy-dsp` (`cdylib` → `dsp.so`, implements schwung's
  `plugin_api_v2`; every FFI entry point catches panics so an engine bug can
  never abort MoveOriginal). Spec/design: `plans/2026-06-12-sequencer-*.md`.
- **UI — `src/seq/`:** `engine.ts` (the only IPC: one batched `cmd`
  set_param/tick + a `status` poll), `state.ts` (mirror), `router.ts`
  (first-look MIDI dispatch — sequencer events never touch the param-page
  handlers) with `router-steps.ts` / `router-pads.ts` / `router-buttons.ts`
  holding the three halves it dispatches to (the step row, pads + held chord,
  and the modal/edit buttons; transport, encoders and arrows stay in
  `router.ts`, which also re-exports the others' public surface so callers keep
  one import site), `leds.ts`/`session.ts`/`render.ts` (cached LEDs, clip grid,
  Loop Overview strip), plus `loop-mode.ts`, `step-edit.ts`, `edit-ops.ts`,
  `pads.ts`, `persist.ts`, `colors.ts`, `constants.ts`.

### Hard rules (learned on device — do not relearn)

- **ENGINE_VERSION must match** between `engine/crates/movy-dsp/src/lib.rs`
  and `src/seq/constants.ts` (`build-dsp.sh` fails the build otherwise). The
  UI probes `ping` and re-issues the DSP load until the version matches.
- **A redeployed `dsp.so` does NOT hot-reload — the stack must restart.** The
  shim dlopens the engine by path, and glibc returns the library already loaded
  under that path for as long as MoveOriginal lives, so the version gate above
  just loops: it re-issues the load and the shim answers with the old binary.
  `deploy.sh` therefore restarts the stack whenever the shipped `dsp.so`
  differs (`--no-restart` opts out, and says loudly that the old engine is
  still running). The restart must run **as root** — MoveOriginal is root's, so
  `restart-move.sh` as the `ableton` user pkills nothing and still exits 0.
  Bumping ENGINE_VERSION once for two different builds hides this completely:
  both answer `ping` with the same string, and the stale one looks current.
- **Engine sets must be blocking** (`host_module_set_param_blocking`): the
  `overtake_dsp:` param SHM is a single slot, so non-blocking writes (and even
  schwung's own DSP-load request) are routinely lost.
- **Never scp over a dlopen'd `dsp.so` in place** — overwriting a mapped
  `.so`'s inode corrupts its pages and crashes MoveOriginal. `deploy.sh`
  ships it scp-to-temp + `mv` (fresh inode).
- Live pad notes are sounded **directly** (`shadow_send_midi_to_dsp`,
  channel = track) for zero latency; the engine only **records** them (no
  double trigger). Recorded notes are suppressed until the clip wraps.
- **Note-offs come from the ledger, never from current state.**
  `keyboard/held-notes.ts` records `padNote → { track, pitch }` at note-on;
  `noteOff`/`drumPadOff` take neither a track nor a `DrumConfig`. Deriving
  either at release time strands notes whenever the active track, module, or
  view changed mid-hold. All `0x8n` sends go through `release.ts:emitNoteOff`.
  `app/unload.ts` (`globalThis.onUnload`, called by the host on *every*
  teardown) releases the ledger plus the engine's open gates read from
  `seqState.activeNotes` — the DSP is unloaded right after, so nothing else
  can close them.
- The engine has no filesystem; the UI ferries persisted state via
  `host_read_file`/`host_write_file` (`src/seq/persist.ts`).

### PErformance

PErformance is very important, make sure you think about it for implementation and add new and run existing performance tests for the new features


### Cost efficient usage

if you are opus or fable 5 try to optimize token usage and make it cost efficient while make sure the code is reviewed by you. if there is an option to use subagent, use it only if it reduces limit usage

### Build / deploy / test the engine

```bash
cd engine && cargo test            # pure seq-core logic (host)
./scripts/build-dsp.sh             # cross-compile aarch64 → dist/dsp.so (glibc <= 2.35)
./scripts/deploy.sh                # builds ui.js + dsp.so, deploys both (atomic .so)
npm run test:device                # device e2e, every scenario (builds + ships dsp.so and ui.js)
```

If MoveOriginal dies, recover with the davebox restart sequence (root SSH;
the user must run it): stop `move-launcher`, pkill the schwung stack, start
`move-launcher`.

## Dev loop

Run tests in this order at the end of every task:

Run `npm run build:browser` first (refreshes `dist/esm`), then in order
(or just `npm test`, which builds + runs all eight local suites — the six below
plus `track-colors.mjs` and `abi-parity.mjs`):

```bash
# 1. Local (always) — viewmodel/business logic assertions
# logic.mjs is only a RUNNER. The suites live in browser-test/logic/<subsystem>.mjs
# — add a test by editing the matching subsystem module, never the runner. A new
# subsystem needs a new module plus one line in each of the runner's two lists.
# browser-test/logic/harness.mjs is the shared kit and must stay the runner's
# first import: it installs the mock globals and owns the single failure counter,
# so new shared imports go in its preamble + export list, not per-suite.
node browser-test/logic.mjs

# 1a. Local (always) — replays all 76 dumped modules; asserts layout invariants
#     + a per-module snapshot (browser-test/dump-expect.json). After an
#     intentional layout change: node browser-test/dump-replay.mjs --update
node browser-test/dump-replay.mjs

# 1b. Local (always) — full init/tick/MIDI loop → setLED (drum grid, multi-step)
node browser-test/app-loop.mjs

# 2. Local (always) — framebuffer pixel-diff vs baselines (pure node, no browser)
node browser-test/screenshot.mjs

# 3. Local (always) — performance regression (fill_rect count, IPC call count, render time)
node browser-test/perf.mjs

# 3a. Local (always) — invariants on the device scripts themselves, so a device
#     suite cannot report "missing" for a log line that is present
node browser-test/device-scripts.mjs

# 4. Device (when reachable) — the whole tier in one process. It builds and
#    deploys dsp.so FIRST, so a Rust change is the one actually under test.
#    A clean run exits 0: there is no known-red check in this tier.
ssh -o ConnectTimeout=3 ableton@move.local echo ok 2>/dev/null \
  && npm run test:device \
  || echo "DEVICE OFFLINE — SKIPPING DEVICE TESTS"
# If offline: report DEVICE OFFLINE to the user in CAPS

# 4a. The above plus the LED restore on the way out, including on Ctrl-C.
#     Tracks 1-16 are all movy chains; there is no second host arrangement to
#     sweep (the two test-all-device-{schwung,movy}.sh scripts named here are
#     long gone).
./scripts/test-all-device.sh [move.local]
```

### Device testing

**`CLAUDE.md` is the single source for this** — see its *The device tier is
`test-device/`*, *What the harness can do*, *Rules that were each paid for
once*, *The fixture*, and *Device tests are a smoke check, not the gate*.

This file used to carry a second copy, and the copies drifted: after the
migration it was still naming `./scripts/test.sh` and two sweep scripts that no
longer exist, and still telling the reader that the tier exits non-zero BY
DESIGN because of a bug that had been fixed. A pointer cannot go stale that way.

The short version:

- `npm run test:device` is the device tier. It builds and deploys `dsp.so`
  itself, and a clean run exits **0**.
- New device tests are scenarios in `test-device/scenarios/`. The bash tier is
  closed to additions and `browser-test/device-scripts.mjs` fails `npm test` on
  a new `scripts/test-*.sh`.
- Device tests are flaky: run once, report, do not chase.

**Build system:** All source lives in `src/` (TypeScript). `npm run build:device`
bundles everything to `ui.js` via esbuild (single ESM file, no stale-module
issues). `npm run build:browser` compiles to `dist/esm/` for browser tests.
Run `node build/device.mjs` before deploying; `scripts/deploy.sh` does this automatically.

**QuickJS module cache:** `shadow_load_ui_module` re-evaluates `ui.js` fresh on
every tool open, but ES modules **imported by** `ui.js` are cached for the entire
`shadow_ui` process lifetime (shadow_ui ignores SIGTERM; SIGKILL kills it without
respawn). The esbuild bundle avoids this: all movy logic is inlined at build time,
leaving only the Schwung shared imports external (`/data/UserData/schwung/shared/*`).

**Never `kill -9` the shadow_ui process** — MoveOriginal (its parent) does not
respawn it, so the device UI breaks until a full reboot.

## Documentation

**Update the user docs for any significant, user-facing change** — a new
feature, page, gesture, control, or a behaviour change a user would notice. Part
of the task, like tests and the commit. (Purely internal/dev-only changes —
refactors, test infra, perf fixes with no visible effect — don't need doc
edits.)

Two docs, two granularities — read them before editing to match their voice:

- **`MANUAL.md`** — the detailed how-to. Every feature/gesture gets explained in
  its section, and every control goes in the **Controls reference** tables
  (section 8). This is where a new gesture or page is documented step by step.
- **`README.md`** — the short marketing overview. Only **headline** features get
  a one-line bullet (in *Features*) with a single screenshot. Update the chain
  description / feature list when a headline capability lands; skip minor tweaks.

**Screenshots:** add them where they help, reusing the **test baselines** so the
docs stay in sync with what the UI actually renders. If a new UI state has no
screenshot yet, add a `browser-test/screenshot.mjs` scene for it first. Then:

```bash
node scripts/make-doc-assets.mjs <baseline-name> [<baseline-name> ...]
# 4× upscales browser-test/screenshots/baseline/<name>.png → docs/assets/<name>.png
```

Reference the result as `docs/assets/<name>.png` in the Markdown.

## Source architecture

All source lives in `src/` (TypeScript). The device build bundles everything into
`ui.js`; the browser test build produces `dist/esm/` (bundled entry points with
code splitting). Never edit `ui.js` directly — it is a build artifact.

### File size limits

- **Hard limit: 200 lines.** If a file exceeds this, split it.
- **Target: 50–100 lines.** One clear responsibility per file.
- The limit exists so the relevant context for any change fits in one read.
- **`browser-test/` is covered too, at a looser ~600-line ceiling** (a suite is
  one coherent subsystem, so 200 would shred it). It was exempt by omission,
  and `logic.mjs` quietly reached 12,620 lines — 63× the src limit — becoming
  the most-edited and most-expensive-to-read file in the repo.

### Directory responsibilities

Run `ls src/` for the current layout — the boundaries below are what matters.

### Key boundaries

- **`model/` never calls display functions** (`fill_rect`, `clear_screen`, `fontPrint`).
  Renderers read a `ViewModel`; they never touch `ModelState`.
- **`renderer/` has no state.** Every render function is pure: same inputs → same
  pixels. State lives in `model/` and `app/state.ts`.
- **`src/types/` has no imports from the rest of `src/`.** Other files import from
  types; types never import back.
- **Module configs are JSON files** in `src/modules/*.json`. Add a new synth by
  dropping a JSON file there and registering it in `loader.ts`. The schema matches
  `ModuleConfig` in `src/types/param.ts`.

### Adding a new synth config

1. Create `src/modules/<id>.json` following the `ModuleConfig` shape.
2. In `src/modules/loader.ts`, add an import and register in `CONFIGS`.
3. Run `npm run build:device` — the JSON is bundled in automatically.

## shadow_ui.js MIDI contract

These facts are stable across Schwung versions. Knowing them avoids re-reading
the 16 000-line `schwung/src/shadow/shadow_ui.js`.

**Knob CC routing (CC 71–78):**
- Hardware knob turns arrive as CC71-78. The shadow UI does NOT forward them
  directly to the module.
- Instead: `overtakeKnobDelta[k] += decodeDelta(d2)` (accumulated, not
  forwarded).
- On each `tick()`, for each k where delta ≠ 0:
  ```
  ccVal = delta > 0 ? Math.min(delta, 63) : Math.max(128 + delta, 65)
  overtakeModuleCallbacks.onMidiMessageInternal([0xB0, 71 + k, ccVal])
  overtakeKnobDelta[k] = 0
  ```
- Decoded back in movy: `decodeDelta(ccVal)` from `shared/input_filter.mjs`.

**All other MIDI:**  forwarded directly as `onMidiMessageInternal(data)`.

**Guard:** the entire overtake block runs only when:
```
view === VIEWS.OVERTAKE_MODULE && overtakeModuleLoaded &&
overtakeModuleCallbacks && !overtakeInitPending
```

**Targeted greps** (instead of reading the file):
```bash
# Knob accumulation + flush:
grep -n "overtakeKnobDelta\|KNOB_CC_START" schwung/src/shadow/shadow_ui.js

# Overtake MIDI routing block start:
grep -n "OVERTAKE_MODULE\|overtakeInitPending\|overtakeModuleCallbacks.onMidi" \
    schwung/src/shadow/shadow_ui.js

# open_tool_cmd handler + shm offsets:
grep -n "open_tool_cmd\|offOpenToolCmd" \
    schwung/src/shadow/shadow_ui.js schwung/schwung-manager/shmconfig.go
```

---

## Host APIs available in JS context

```javascript
shadow_get_ui_slot()                          // → int  currently focused chain slot (0-3)
shadow_get_param(slot, "synth:ui_hierarchy")  // → JSON string or null
shadow_get_param(slot, "synth:<key>")         // → string value or null
shadow_set_param(slot, "synth:<key>", valStr) // → bool (true = IPC accepted)
shadow_send_midi_to_dsp([status, d1, d2])     // inject MIDI to active slot's DSP
host_exit_module()                            // exit movy, return to shadow UI
```

`ui_hierarchy` JSON shape (from `CONVENTIONS.md` in the schwung repo):
```json
{
  "levels": {
    "root": {
      "knobs": ["param_key1", "param_key2", ...],
      "params": [{"key": "param_key", "label": "Label"}, ...]
    }
  }
}
```
Param metadata (min/max/step/type) comes from `shadow_get_param(slot, "synth:chain_params")`.

---

## open_tool_cmd protocol

The only way to open a tool programmatically (the device harness does this
through `test-device/bus.ts`'s `openTool`, which is how every scenario opens and
reopens movy):

```python
import mmap, json
with open("/data/UserData/schwung/open_tool_cmd.json", "w") as f:
    f.write(json.dumps({"file_path": "/", "tool_id": "movy"}))
with open("/dev/shm/schwung-control", "r+b") as f:
    mm = mmap.mmap(f.fileno(), 0)  # use 0 — file is 64 bytes, explicit size fails
    mm[56] = 1                     # offOpenToolCmd = 56 (shmconfig.go)
    mm.close()
```

---

## Known gotchas

**Pad range overlaps knob CC range.**  
Pad note range is `d1 = 68–99`. Knob CC range is `d1 = 71–78` (inside pads).
In `onMidiMessageInternal`, the pad handler must `return` only inside the
`note-on` / `note-off` branches — not unconditionally. If `return` is at the
bottom of the pad block, CC71-78 are silently swallowed before the knob handler
runs.

**`mmap` size on `/dev/shm/schwung-control`.**  
The shm file is 64 bytes. `mmap.mmap(f.fileno(), 256)` raises
`ValueError: mmap length is greater than file size`. Always use `mmap(f, 0)`.

**`decodeDelta` for re-encoded knob CCs.**  
The shadow UI re-encodes accumulated deltas: 1-63 = clockwise, 65-127 =
counter-clockwise. `decodeDelta` from `shared/input_filter.mjs` handles this.
Do not treat the raw `d2` value as a delta directly.

---

## Font

`src/font/glyphs.ts` contains the pixel font as a pre-rasterised glyph table.
`FONT_HEIGHT = 5`. Glyph format: `[advance, yOff, w, h, ...rowBytes]`
with bit0 = leftmost pixel per row. The original OTF has been removed;
the glyph data in `glyphs.ts` is the source of truth.
