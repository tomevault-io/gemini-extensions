This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working in this repository.

# Project purpose

Build a real Delphi Win64 debugger for VS Code using DAP + Windows Debug API.

Primary goal is progress on the debugger itself.
The sample target app exists only for testing.
It may be extended whenever needed to validate new debugger features.

# Operating mode

Use minimum tokens.

Be concise.
No filler.
No praise.
No motivational tone.
No repeating the request.
No long plans unless asked.
No unnecessary explanations.

If code requested: output code first.
If uncertain: say uncertain.
If idea is bad: say so directly.

Prefer practical solutions over academic ones.

# Critical token rules

Assume context window and usage budget are scarce.

Avoid re-reading many files unless necessary.
Avoid broad repo scans.
Inspect only files relevant to the current task.
Do not restate known project context.

Prefer direct edits over discussion.

When multiple approaches exist:
choose the smallest production-relevant step.
Do not implement shortcuts that only work for Debugme.
Every solution must be compatible with real Delphi Win64 applications unless explicitly marked as prototype-only.
Prefer incremental progress, but never hardcode assumptions from the test project.

# Prototype vs production

Debugme is only a test target.

Never design features around Debugme-specific assumptions.

Allowed:
- using Debugme to reproduce and validate behavior
- extending Debugme to cover newly implemented debugger features
- implementing narrow incremental pieces

Not allowed:
- hardcoded source paths
- hardcoded module names
- hardcoded symbol names
- assumptions about one unit, one source file, one thread, one stack frame, or one module
- solutions that work only because Debugme is trivial

If a temporary shortcut is unavoidable:
- mark it clearly with TODO PROTOTYPE
- document what must change for real projects
- update TASK_RESUME.md with the limitation

# Session continuity rules

Maintain these files:

- PROJECT_STATE.md   (high-level permanent state)
- TASK_RESUME.md     (exact current task state)

Update TASK_RESUME.md continuously enough that work can resume after an interruption in the middle of a long step.

Do not wait for a full step to finish.

Update TASK_RESUME.md whenever restart cost is starting to rise, especially after:

- a non-trivial discovery
- a code edit
- a test/build result
- a local change of hypothesis
- a switch of file, symbol, or investigation path
- any sign that token budget may run out before the current step is complete

If usage seems near limit:
stop coding and update TASK_RESUME.md first.

TASK_RESUME.md must contain:

- current task
- current substep
- current files / symbols in focus
- last completed action
- next action if interrupted right now
- files involved
- what works
- what is failing
- last test result
- exact next step
- traps / hypotheses

When a long step is still in progress, TASK_RESUME.md must describe the current cursor inside that step, not just the high-level milestone.

The cursor should be brief but specific enough that a new session can continue without re-reading broad context.

PROJECT_STATE.md must contain:

- architecture status
- implemented features
- open milestones
- important technical discoveries
- stable build/run commands

PROJECT_STATE.md must not duplicate transient task state that belongs in TASK_RESUME.md.

# Living specifications

The following documents at the repository root are living specifications.
They describe state of knowledge about the project's formats and
architecture and are maintained continuously alongside the code:

- `RSM_FORMAT_NOTES.md` — overall structure of the Delphi `.rsm` file.
- `RSM_RECORD_TYPES.md` — catalog of tags / record kinds with confirmed /
  inferred / conjectured status.
- `RSM_FIELD_OFFSETS.md` — byte-level layout of each record.
- `DAP_DEBUGGER_ARCHITECTURE.md` — modules, threading model, breakpoint /
  evaluate / setVariable flows, capability list.
- `KNOWN_UNKNOWNS.md` — open questions that block or condition the work.

Rules:

- Before investigating anything related to `.rsm`, the adapter
  architecture, or open questions: read the relevant document first. Do
  not re-derive what is already written.
- When you discover or confirm a fact: update the relevant document in
  the same change set as the code or experiment that produced the fact.
- When an entry in `KNOWN_UNKNOWNS.md` is resolved: move the answer into
  whichever document now owns it (`RSM_*`, `DAP_DEBUGGER_*`,
  `PROJECT_STATE.md`) and remove the entry from `KNOWN_UNKNOWNS.md`. Do
  not leave resolved questions there for historical reference.
- If a document disagrees with the code: the code wins. Correct the
  document, do not bend the code to match the document.

# Resume behavior

When starting a new session:

1. Read PROJECT_STATE.md
2. Read TASK_RESUME.md
3. Read the living specifications relevant to the next step:
   - work on symbols / locals / globals / types → the `RSM_*` documents
   - work on the adapter, debug loop, DAP requests, stepping → `DAP_DEBUGGER_ARCHITECTURE.md`
   - in every session, regardless of focus → `KNOWN_UNKNOWNS.md`
4. Inspect only referenced files first
5. Resume exactly from next step

Do not restart analysis from zero unless required.

# Code generation rules

Respect existing code style.

Use 2-space indentation.

For Delphi:

- never use with
- prefer explicit code
- minimum supported Delphi version is Delphi Athens for both this project and debug targets
- keep compatibility with Delphi Athens toolchain and generated binaries
- prefer modern Delphi libraries and language features when they improve clarity or robustness
- prefer current RTL facilities over old compatibility-era helpers
- examples: System.SysUtils, System.Classes, System.IOUtils, System.Generics.Collections, System.Generics.Defaults, System.Math, System.DateUtils, System.JSON where appropriate
- use generics where appropriate
- use modern string helpers and extension-style helpers where available
- use anonymous methods, records with methods/operators, class helpers, scoped enums, inline variables, type inference, and other modern Delphi features when they make the code clearer
- avoid outdated pre-Unicode or legacy-era coding patterns
- avoid unnecessary abstractions
- prefer boring robust code

For Windows debugger code:

- correctness over cleverness
- log failures clearly
- keep state transitions understandable
- avoid hidden magic

# Documentation rules

For generated files, comments, README, docs, commit messages:

Use normal professional technical English.
Do not use caveman style.
Be concise but polished.

# Response format after edits

After coding work, respond with only:

- files changed
- what changed
- build/test executed
- result
- next step

# DevTools

Diagnostic tools are in `DevTools\` (versioned, in project group).
Build all:

```powershell
cmd /c "C:\Athens\GitHub\Win64Debugger\DevTools\build_all.bat" 2>&1
```

Run tools (after building):

```powershell
# Inspect RSM binary structure
DevTools\Win64\Debug\RsmAnalyzer.exe     Win64\Debug\Debugme.rsm

# Find a method/class name in RSM and show surrounding bytes
DevTools\Win64\Debug\ScanRsmMethods.exe  Win64\Debug\Debugme.rsm TWidget.Create

# Dump function bytes from PE at hex RVA
DevTools\Win64\Debug\DumpFunc.exe        Win64\Debug\Debugme.exe 2CCA0 64

# Smoke-test adapter RSM parser against any .rsm file
DevTools\Win64\Debug\TestRsmParser.exe   Win64\Debug\Debugme.rsm

# Test nested-proc detection in MAP reader
DevTools\Win64\Debug\TestNested.exe      Win64\Debug\Debugme.map

# Prebuild .idx symbol-index sidecars for a directory (offline warm-up),
# or -verify that a parser change kept the sidecar format byte-identical
DevTools\Win64\Debug\PrebuildIdx.exe     <dir> [-r] [-j N] [-verify] [-force]
```

See `DevTools\README.md` for full documentation.

`build_all.bat` uses `cd /d %~dp0` internally — call it as:
```powershell
cmd /c "C:\Athens\GitHub\Win64Debugger\DevTools\build_all.bat" 2>&1
```
This pattern is pre-approved in `.claude/settings.json` (committed).

# Shell command patterns

A hook blocks any Bash or PowerShell command that starts with `cd <path> &&` or uses `cd` compounded with a path operation. **Never** generate that pattern.

Instead, put `cd /d %~dp0` **inside** a `.bat` file and call the bat with its full path:

```powershell
# WRONG — triggers hook, requires manual approval every time
PowerShell(cmd /c "cd /d C:\some\path && rsvars.bat && dcc64 Foo.dpr")

# RIGHT — cd is inside the bat; call with full path; pre-approved by .claude/settings.json
cmd /c "C:\Athens\GitHub\Win64Debugger\DevTools\build_all.bat" 2>&1
```

For one-off scripts: put them in the repo, add them to `.claude/settings.json` as a wildcard.
Do NOT add individual command strings to `.claude/settings.local.json` — that file is
machine-specific and would need to be recreated on every new computer.

# Integration tests

The automated test suite lives in `DebuggerTests\`. It launches the DAP adapter, exercises breakpoints/locals/step, and asserts correctness.

Run from any working directory — scripts use `cd /d %~dp0` internally:

```powershell
# Build everything + run tests
cmd /c "C:\Athens\GitHub\Win64Debugger\DebuggerTests\build_and_run.bat" 2>&1

# Build only the test target (TestTarget.exe)
cmd /c "C:\Athens\GitHub\Win64Debugger\DebuggerTests\build_target.bat" 2>&1

# Build only the test runner (RunTests.exe)
cmd /c "C:\Athens\GitHub\Win64Debugger\DebuggerTests\build_runner.bat" 2>&1

# Run already-built tests
cmd /c "C:\Athens\GitHub\Win64Debugger\DebuggerTests\run_tests.bat" 2>&1
```

These patterns are pre-approved in `.claude/settings.json` (committed).
Run the full suite after every change to the adapter or RSM parser.

# Build

Use the existing build scripts when possible.

Build everything:

```bat
call build_debug.bat
```

This initializes the Delphi compiler environment, compiles `Debugme.exe` (emitting its `.map` and `.rsm`), and compiles `VisualStudioCodeDelphiDebugger.exe`.

Build adapter only:

```powershell
cmd /c "C:\Athens\GitHub\Win64Debugger\build_dap.bat" 2>&1
```

**Critical:** `build_dap.bat` does `pushd VisualStudioCodeDelphiDebugger` before compiling, so DCUs and EXE land in
`VisualStudioCodeDelphiDebugger\Win64\Debug\`. Running `dcc64` directly from the repo root puts output in `Win64\Debug\`
(wrong location — VS Code extension expects `VisualStudioCodeDelphiDebugger\Win64\Debug\VisualStudioCodeDelphiDebugger.exe`).
Never invoke `dcc64 VisualStudioCodeDelphiDebugger\VisualStudioCodeDelphiDebugger.dpr` from the repo root without explicit `-E` and `-NU` overrides.

Manual debug target build:

```bat
call rsvars.bat
dcc64 Debugme.dpr
```

Debug target outputs:

```text
Win64\Debug\Debugme.exe
Win64\Debug\Debugme.rsm
Win64\Debug\Debugme.map
```

Compiler flags for debug targets:

| Flag | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `-$O-` | Disable optimization |
| `-V -VN -VR` | Generate debug info / MAP / RSM |
| `-DDEBUG` | Define DEBUG conditional |
| `-E.\Win64\Debug` | Output directory |

`Debugme.cfg` contains direct command-line compiler options, one per line, without leading `-`.
`Debugme.delphilsp.json` contains LSP-driven compiler options in `dccOptions`.
In this workspace it is already wired through `delphiLsp.settingsFile` in `Win64DebuggerProj.code-workspace`.

# VS Code setup

Open `Win64DebuggerProj.code-workspace`, not the folder directly.

Relevant files:

- `Win64DebuggerProj.code-workspace`
- `Debugme.delphilsp.json`
- `.vscode/launch.json`
- `install\local.delphi-win64-debug\package.json` (the single canonical extension manifest)

Required extension:

- `embarcaderotechnologies.delphilsp`

Local debugger extension folder:

```text
%USERPROFILE%\.vscode\extensions\local.delphi-win64-debug\
```

Install (build first, then one of):

- `install\Install.exe` — interactive: builds if needed, packages the extension
  into a `.vsix` and installs it into every detected VS Code-family editor
  (VS Code, Insiders, Cursor, Windsurf, VSCodium, Trae) via that editor's
  `<cli> --install-extension` (required on 1.96+; a plain folder copy is no
  longer loaded). Per editor it falls back to a folder copy only when the editor
  is present but its CLI is not on PATH. When no editor is detected it prints
  download links and the manual install command instead of blocking on a prompt
  (the `FamilyEditors` table in `Install.dpr` is the editor list).
- `install-dev.bat` — development: builds, then points the extension `program`
  directly at the build output (no copy; fastest iteration).

`install\local.delphi-win64-debug\package.json` is the single source of truth
for the extension manifest. It registers the `delphi-win64` debug type, declares
the full launch-config schema, and references the adapter via the relative path
`./VisualStudioCodeDelphiDebugger.exe`. It has no `main`, so no `extension.js`
is needed (a pure debug-type contribution that launches the external adapter).

# Symbol/debug-info notes

Delphi `.map` files provide line numbers and symbol addresses, but no full type/variable metadata.
The `.rsm` file is Embarcadero's Win64 remote debug symbol map.
It is not a GDB/WinDbg symbol format.
Real variable inspection will require parsing richer debug/type information or deriving enough runtime metadata from other sources.

Do not assume MAP-only debugging is enough for variables/watches.
