# CodeDNA v0.8 — In-Source Communication Protocol
# Annotate your project: pip install git+https://github.com/Larens94/codedna.git && codedna init ./

Every source file in this project must have a CodeDNA module docstring as the very first block.

## Module docstring format

```python
"""filename.py — <what it does, ≤15 words>.

exports: public_function(arg) -> return_type
used_by: consumer_file.py → consumer_function
rules:   <hard constraint agents must never violate>
agent:   <model-id> | <provider> | <YYYY-MM-DD> | <session_id> | <what you did and what you noticed>
         message: "<open hypothesis or observation for the next agent>"
"""
```

## Rules on every edit

- Read `.codedna` at repo root first — project structure and recent session history
- Re-read `rules:` as your **first** step — never violate these constraints
- Read `Rules:` in function docstrings before writing logic there
- Check `used_by:` after changes — update callers if signatures change
- Never rename `exports:` symbols without explicit instruction
- If you discover a constraint or fix a bug, add it to `rules:` for the next agent
- After editing, append a new `agent:` line to the module docstring. Keep only the last 5 entries — drop the oldest if adding a 6th. Full history is in git and `.codedna`.

## Rules on generate

- Write the module docstring before any imports
- Every public function **must** have a `Rules:` docstring
- Use semantic variable names: `list_dict_users_from_db = get_users()`

## Writing good `rules:`

`rules:` must be **specific and actionable** — never vague.

```python
# ✅ Good rules:
rules:   get_invoices() returns ALL tenants — caller MUST filter is_suspended() before aggregating
rules:   amount is in cents not euros — divide by 100 before display
rules:   soft-delete via deleted_at — NEVER use DELETE, always SET deleted_at = NOW()

# ❌ Bad rules:
rules:   handle errors gracefully
rules:   follow best practices
rules:   none  ← when there ARE constraints but nobody wrote them
```

Update rules: every time you discover a constraint, fix a bug, or notice a non-obvious behavior.

## Writing critical functions

Every public function **must** have a `Rules:` docstring:

```python
def process(arg: type) -> return_type:
    """Short description.

    Rules:   MUST cap before returning; exceed = compliance bug.
    message: <model-id> | <date> | open observation for next agent (optional)
    """
```

## Inline annotations on complex logic

When writing or editing code blocks with non-obvious logic, add a `# Rules:` or `# message:` comment above the block:

```python
# Rules: skip cancelled orders — status=4 means cancelled in legacy DB
active = [o for o in orders if o.status != 4]

# message: exchange rate uses daily rate, not real-time
amount = order.amount * get_exchange_rate(order.currency)
```

When to add: business-rule conditionals, loops with filtering, algorithm steps where order matters, edge cases.
When NOT to add: simple getters, obvious control flow, standard library usage.

## `message:` — Agent Chat Layer (v0.8)

Use `message:` for observations not yet certain enough to become `rules:`, open questions, and notes for the next agent.

**Lifecycle:** promote to `rules:` with `@prev: promoted to rules:` or dismiss with `@prev: verified, not applicable because...`. Always append-only — never delete.

## CodeDNA + native memory — additive, not replacing

CodeDNA is the **shared** layer — git-tracked, visible to every agent and every tool. It does not replace Windsurf's native memories. Use both:

- `.codedna` + file annotations → shared architectural truth, readable by any tool on any machine
- Windsurf native memories → user preferences and tool-specific context — local to Windsurf

## Planner read protocol

Read `.codedna` first. Then read only the module docstring (first 8–12 lines) of each file. Build an `exports:` → `used_by:` graph. Open only relevant files in full.

## Session end protocol

At session end, append to `.codedna` `agent_sessions:`:
```yaml
- agent: <model-id>
  provider: <provider>
  date: <YYYY-MM-DD>
  session_id: <s_YYYYMMDD_NNN>
  task: "<what you did ≤15 words>"
  changed: [files, modified]
  visited: [files, read]
  message: > what you found and what the next agent should know
```
