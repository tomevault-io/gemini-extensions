## What This Is

go-carbon is a high-performance Golang implementation of Graphite's carbon-cache daemon. It receives metrics via multiple protocols (TCP, UDP, Pickle, HTTP, Kafka, PubSub), buffers them in a sharded in-memory cache, and persists them to Whisper (.wsp) files. Also serves a read API (carbonserver) compatible with graphite-web and carbonapi.

## Build & Test Commands

```bash
make                    # Build the go-carbon binary
make test               # Run tests, vet, and race detection (all three)
go test ./...           # Run tests only (faster iteration)
go test -race ./...     # Run tests with race detector
go vet ./...            # Run vet only
go test -run TestName ./package/  # Run a single test
make image              # Build Docker image (requires Linux binary)
```

Dependencies use vendoring (`-mod=vendor` is set via GOFLAGS in the Makefile). Run `go mod tidy && go mod vendor` when updating dependencies.

## Linting

CI uses golangci-lint v2. Config is in `.golangci.yml`. Enabled linters: gocritic, ineffassign, asciicheck, misspell, promlinter, errorlint, govet, unparam, bodyclose, gochecknoinits. Formatters: gofmt, goimports.

## Architecture

### Data Flow
```
Receivers (TCP/UDP/Pickle/HTTP/Kafka/PubSub)
    │
    ▼
  Cache (sharded concurrent map, 1024 shards)
    │
    ├──▶ Persister (worker pool writes to Whisper .wsp files)
    │
    ├──▶ CarbonLink (legacy pickle protocol for cache reads)
    │
    └──▶ Carbonserver (HTTP/gRPC read API with trigram/trie index)
```

### Core Pipeline

- **`points/`** - The fundamental data type: `Points{Metric string, Data []Point}` where `Point{Value float64, Timestamp int64}`. Flows through the entire pipeline.

- **`receiver/`** - Plugin-based metric ingestion. Each protocol (TCP, UDP, Pickle, HTTP, Kafka, PubSub) registers via `receiver.Register()` and is instantiated at startup. Protocols are wired in `carbon/app.go` with `registerPluginsOnce`. Custom receivers are configured via TOML `[[receiver.*]]` sections.

- **`cache/`** - Sharded concurrent map (1024 shards) that buffers incoming points. Three write strategies: `max` (most unwritten points first), `sorted` (by timestamp), `noop` (unspecified order). The `WriteoutQueue` feeds metrics to the persister. Optional bloom filter for new metric detection.

- **`persister/`** - Writes cached points to Whisper `.wsp` files. Configurable worker count (metrics sharded by `crc32(metricName) % workers`). Handles storage-schemas.conf and storage-aggregation.conf parsing. Supports online migration of Whisper file configurations.

- **`carbonserver/`** - HTTP+gRPC read API serving find/render/info requests to graphite-web or carbonapi. Two index types: **trigram** (default, uses trigram indexing for glob matching) and **trie** (better for 10M+ metrics, uses DFA-based matching). Supports query/find/glob caches, rate limiting, and quota enforcement.

### Supporting Packages

- **`carbon/`** - Application orchestrator. `App` struct owns all components and manages lifecycle (start, stop, config reload). `Config` is TOML-based (parsed via `BurntSushi/toml`).
- **`api/`** - gRPC API for cache queries (CarbonLink-like).
- **`tags/`** - Tag normalization and external TagDB integration.
- **`helper/`** - Protobuf definitions (`carbonpb/`, `carbonzipperpb/`), stats, throttling, file utilities.

## Common Patterns

- Config format is TOML (parsed via `BurntSushi/toml`), not YAML or JSON
- Dependencies are vendored: always use `go mod tidy && go mod vendor` after changes
- `GOFLAGS=-mod=vendor` is set in the Makefile — all go commands respect vendoring
- Version is `const Version` in `go-carbon.go`, build version injected via ldflags
- The receiver system uses a plugin registry pattern — protocols self-register via `init()` or explicit `Register()` calls
- Components implement start/stop lifecycle managed by `carbon.App` using `helper.Stoppable`
- Stats are collected via a `Collector` that gathers metrics from all components
- Prometheus metrics are optional (gated by `prometheus.enabled` config)
- Logging uses `lomik/zapwriter` (structured zap-based logging with rotation)
- Graceful shutdown flows: `App.stopListeners()` → `App.stopAll()`

## Signal Handling

- **SIGHUP** → config reload (whisper settings, schemas, aggregation, common, dump sections)
- **SIGUSR2** → graceful dump-and-stop (dump cache to disk, exit; restored on next start)

## Configuration

Config format is TOML. See `go-carbon.conf.example` for all options. Key config files:
- Main config: `go-carbon.conf` (TOML)
- `storage-schemas.conf` - Retention policies (standard Graphite format)
- `storage-aggregation.conf` - Aggregation methods (standard Graphite format)
- `storage-quotas.conf` - Optional, go-carbon specific (see `doc/quotas.md`)

Version is defined as `const Version` in `go-carbon.go`. Build version is injected via `-ldflags '-X main.BuildVersion=...'`.

## CI

- Tests with Go oldstable + stable, including race detector
- golangci-lint v2
- Docker image build
- Package builds (deb/rpm via nfpm for i386, amd64, arm64)
- govulncheck on stable Go
