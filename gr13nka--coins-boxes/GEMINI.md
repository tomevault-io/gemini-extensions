## Key Patterns

- **No goto** — use `repeat/until` loops for retries. Goto breaks the web build.
- **Logic/visual separation** — data modules (`resources`, `bags`, `coin_sort`, `powerups`) have zero drawing code; screen modules handle all rendering.
- **Module exports** — each module returns a table of public functions.
- **Iterator** — `utils.each_coin(boxes)` for coin traversal.
- **Immediate-mode UI** — buttons drawn as rectangles, hit-tested on mouse click.

## Rendering

1080x2400 virtual canvas (portrait) with letterboxing. Screen-to-game coord conversion via `ox`, `oy`, `scale` in `main.lua`. Coins are always rendered as tinted `ball.png`.

## Screen System

Each screen is a table with optional methods: `enter()`, `exit()`, `update(dt)`, `draw()`, `mousepressed(x, y, button)`, `keypressed(key, scancode, isrepeat)`.

**Active Screens:** `coin_sort` (Coin Sort, default start), `arena` (Merge Arena), `game_over`, `skill_tree` (Skill Tree)
**Dormant Screens:** `mode_select` — kept in code but not registered.

**Adding a new screen:**
1. Create `my_screen.lua` with screen table and methods
2. Add `my_screen.init(assets)` to receive shared assets
3. In `main.lua`, require, init, and register with `screens.register()`

## Two-Screen Loop (Coin Sort + Merge Arena)

```
[App Start] -> [coin_sort] <--tab bar--> [arena]
                   |                        ^
             [all boxes full,               |
              no merges possible]           |
                   |                        |
                   v                        |
             [game_over]                    |
                   |                        |
             ["Continue to Arena"] ---------+
```

1. `coin_sort_screen.enter()` uses fixed 3×5 grid (15 boxes, 10 slots each), inits game
2. Deal coins from bags (limited). Merge coins to earn Fuel/Stars.
3. Switch to Arena via tab bar. Generators cost 1 Fuel per tap to produce items.
4. Completing arena orders rewards XP + items (to dispenser queue).
5. Game over (all boxes full, no merges) → resource summary → Continue to Arena.

**Resource flow:** Coin Sort merges → Fuel + Stars → Arena generators → items → orders → XP + Bags + Stars + more items

**Tab bar** (tab_bar.lua) is drawn by both coin_sort_screen and arena_screen at bottom of canvas. Handles its own hit testing.

**Free bag timer** ticks on all screens via `bags.update(dt)`.

## Animation System

See `animation.lua` for all config constants and math formulas.

**Dual-track architecture** — two independent state tracks run simultaneously:
- **Pick track:** IDLE → HOVERING → FLYING (player interaction)
- **Background track:** IDLE → MERGING → DEALING (automated)

Players can pick/place coins while merge/dealing animations play in the background. Boxes currently being merged (`getMergeLockedBoxes()`) are excluded from interaction.

**Hover/Flight flow:**
1. Click box with coins → `startHover()` → coins lift up (~50ms) then stay static
2. Click destination → `startFlight()` → coins arc to target, drop one by one
3. Each landing triggers `coinLandCallback` (adds coin, plays sound)
4. All landed → `callback` fires → IDLE

**Return-to-source:** clicking the source box while hovering returns coins via `animation.getSourceBox()`.

**Merge flow (both modes):**
1. Call `getMergeableBoxes()` on the game module
2. Pass to `startMerge(merge_data, onComplete, onBoxMerge, particles)`
3. Per box (sequentially with delay): coins slide up one-by-one with particles + shake, `onBoxMerge` callback updates game state, new coin pops with elastic bounce
4. All done → `onComplete()` → IDLE

**Dealing flow (poker dealer style):**
1. Call `calculateCoinsToAdd()` to pre-calculate destinations
2. `startDealing()` — coins fly from bottom center to destination boxes with spin
3. Each landing triggers `onCoinLand`, all done triggers `onComplete`

**Screen shake:** intensity scales with merge progress (40% → 100%). Apply via `love.graphics.translate(animation.getScreenShake())` inside `push()`/`pop()`.

## Layout System

See `layout.lua` for all static values and metric formulas.

**Progressive grid scaling:** `layout.getGridMetrics(cols, rows)` computes all sizing. After calling `layout.applyMetrics()`, you MUST call `graphics.updateMetrics()` and `input.updateMetrics()` to refresh cached values. (`animation.lua` reads layout globals directly — no refresh needed.)

**Two-layer depth mode (poker-chip stacking):**
- Activates at `rows >= TWO_LAYER_THRESHOLD` (default 8)
- Pairs slots into visual rows: odd slots = back layer (offset up-left), even = front (offset down-right)
- `graphics.drawCoins2048` renders back layer first for proper z-order

**Multi-row column layout:**
- Activates at `cols >= MULTI_ROW_THRESHOLD` (default 7)
- Wraps columns into 2 visual rows, `column_step` uses `cols_per_row` so coins stay large
- `layout.columnPosition(column)` transparently handles row wrapping
- Can combine with two-layer mode (7+ cols AND 8+ rows)

## Coin Sort Mode (coin_sort.lua)

Coins are `{number=N}`, 5 cycling colors via `coin_utils.numberToColor()`. Placement: same number or empty slot only. Full box of same number → `MERGE_OUTPUT` (2) coins of number+1. See module for all balance constants.

**Two-cap progression system:**
- Buffer cap: `floor(COLS * 0.70) + difficulty_extra_types` (hard cap: cols-1)
- Progression cap: `min(10, 3 + floor(merges/10))`
- `max_spawn_number = min(progression_cap, buffer_cap)`

**Dealing algorithm (`computeDeal()`):**
- Initial deal: `2 * BOX_ROWS` coins, uniform types. Regular: `BOX_ROWS * uniform(0.5, 0.9)` with weighted distribution.
- Sparse board bonus: when fill < 30%, deal lerps toward `2 * BOX_ROWS` (0% fill → full initial size)
- 36% chance to skip each type per deal for variety. Lower numbers weighted heavier.

**Max coin tracking:** `executeMergeOnBox()` and `merge()` track max_coin_reached via progression. On `init()`, `max_spawn_number` boosted to `max(2, max_coin_reached - 2)`.

**Fixed 3×5 grid:** 15 boxes (3 rows × 5 columns), each holding 10 coin slots.

**Bag-based dealing:** `dealFromBag()` consumes one bag (from `bags.lua`) and deals coins. No unlimited adding.

**Game over:** only when ALL boxes full AND no merges possible.

**Save/Load:** `coin_sort.save()` persists full game state (boxes, points, total_merges, max_spawn_number, active_box_count) via `progression.setCoinSortData()`. Saved after merges, deals, placements, hammer use, and screen exit. `coin_sort.clearSave()` clears saved state on game over so next init starts fresh. `coin_sort.init()` restores from save if `saved.game_active and saved.boxes`, otherwise starts fresh game.

## Merge Arena (arena.lua + arena_chains.lua + arena_orders.lua)

**7×8 grid** (56 cells). Linear index: `(row-1)*7 + col` (1-indexed). Cell states: empty (`nil`), box (`{state="box", chain_id, level}`), sealed (`{state="sealed", chain_id, level}`), normal item (`{chain_id, level}`). Generators are normal items at/above chain's `generator_threshold`.

### 12 Item Chains

| Chain | Abbr | Color | Items | Gen Threshold | Produces |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Chill | Ch | light blue | L1-3 items, L4-10 gens (Fridge) | 4 | Me 1-3, Da 1-3, Ch 1 |
| Cupboard | Cu | brown | L1-3 items, L4-9 gens | 4 | Ta 1-2, Ki 1-2, Bl 1, He 1 |
| Heating | He | red/orange | L1-3 items, L4-10 gens (Toaster) | 4 | Ba 1-2 |
| Blending | Bl | purple | L1-3 items, L4-10 gens (Blender) | 4 | De 1-3 |
| Kitchenware | Ki | green | L1-6 items, L7 gen (Pot) | 7 | So 1 |
| Tableware | Ta | blue | L1-6 items, L7 gen (Carafe) | 7 | Be 1-2 |
| Meat | Me | dark red | 12 items | — | — |
| Dairy | Da | yellow | 12 items | — | — |
| Bakery | Ba | warm brown | 10 items | — | — |
| Desert | De | pink | 12 items | — | — |
| Soups | So | olive | 6 items | — | — |
| Beverages | Be | teal | 6 items | — | — |

**Generator drops — shuffle bag system:** Generators do NOT use random drops. Instead, a shuffle bag is pre-filled with all items required by uncompleted orders in the current level (exact chain+level), then Fisher-Yates shuffled. Each generator tap pulls the next item from the bag. When empty, refill from remaining uncompleted orders. Bag clears on level advancement. Fallback to `arena_chains.rollDrop()` only when all orders are complete.

**Tutorial generator drops are hardcoded:** First tap → Da1 (Egg), second tap → Me1 (Smoked Meat). After tutorial, switches to shuffle bag.

### Merge Rules
- Source must be a normal item (not box/sealed). Target can be normal OR sealed.
- Same chain_id AND same level AND level < max → merge to level+1 (always unsealed).
- After merge: adjacent boxes (4-directional) reveal as sealed items.

### Generator Mechanics
- Tap = spend 1 Fuel + 1 charge → pull from shuffle bag (or hardcoded during tutorial) → place in nearest empty cell (BFS).
- Cannot tap if Fuel < 1, grid full, or generator depleted (charges = 0).
- **Charge system:** Each generator has ~10-14 charges (scales with level offset from threshold via `GEN_CHARGE_TABLE`, plus `skill_tree.getGenChargeBonus()`). When fully depleted, recharges ALL charges after `skill_tree.getGenRechargeTime()` seconds (base 600). Merging two generators into a higher level gives full charges instantly. `fbon` node gives 20% chance to skip fuel cost.
- Charge state stored on cell: `{chain_id, level, charges, recharge_timer}`. Timer ticks in `arena.update(dt)`.
- Dispenser taps do NOT cost fuel (free reward placement).

### Dispenser, Stash, Drag Rules
- **Dispenser:** FIFO queue above grid, shows 1 item. Fed by: tutorial, order rewards, level rewards. **Tap to pop** — tapping dispenser places item in nearest empty grid cell (not draggable).
- **Stash:** Dynamic slots (base 8, increased by skill tree nodes `stas`/`stash2`) below grid. Storage only, no merging. Grid↔stash movement allowed.
- **Drag sources → valid targets:** grid→grid(empty/merge/sealed-merge), grid→stash(empty), stash→grid(empty), stash→stash(rearrange). Tap on generator = activate.

### Orders
10 levels of static orders (Season 1). Characters: Meryl, Murray, Marcus, Mike, Midori. Up to 3 visible at a time from current level. Complete order → items removed from grid, XP + bags + stars rewarded (no item rewards). All level orders done → level rewards (items + XP) → next level. Orders hidden during tutorial until step 13.

**Order gating:** Orders requiring items from chains whose parent generator is locked are hidden. Level completion only requires PRODUCIBLE orders. Shuffle bag also skips locked orders. `CHAIN_PRODUCER` maps sub-chains to parent generators (Me/Da→Ch, Ba→He, De→Bl, So→Ki, Be→Ta). Uses lazy `require("arena")` to avoid circular dependency.

**Order item highlighting:** Grid items that match any visible order requirement are highlighted with a green border (visual only, not locked — player can still merge/move them). Count-aware: if an order needs 2× Me5, only 2 Me5 items get highlighted.

**Generator quality scaling:** After rolling base drop level, `rollDrop()` applies a quality bonus (level+1 chance) based on `max_coin_reached` from Coin Sort: mcr3→5%, mcr4→10%, mcr5→20%, mcr6→30%, mcr7+→40%. Capped at chain max_level.

### Arena Screen Layout (1080×1920 virtual canvas)
- Fuel bar: Y 0-40
- Dispenser: Y 45-135 (single slot centered, queue count badge)
- Grid: Y 150-1298 (cell=140px, gap=4px, 7×8)
- Stash: Y 1310-1420 (8 horizontal slots, 110px each)
- Orders: Y 1435-1665 (up to 3 order cards)
- Tab bar: Y 1840-1920

### Initial Board
Full grid contents (all start as boxes except center area):
```
He3 Ch3 Bl5 Ch3 Cu2 Bl2 Cu3
Ki2 He3 Ki2 Cu1 Ch3 Bl1 Ch2
Ch5 Ki1 Ta2 Ch1 Cu2 Bl3 Cu4
He2 Cu3 Cu1 Da1 Bl2 He3 Ch5
Ta3 He2 Ta1  .   .  He4 Ki2
He2 Ch2 Da2 Me3 Ch3 Ta2 He4
He3 Ki2 Bl2 Da2 Me1 He4 Ch4
Ch3 Ki2 Ch4 Cu2 Da1 He3 Ki3
```
Initially sealed (visible): row4 cols 3-5 (Cu1,Da1,Bl2), row5 cols 2,3,6 (He2,Ta1,He4), row6 cols 3-5 (Da2,Me3,Ch3). Row5 cols 4-5 are empty. Everything else is boxes.

### Tutorial (18-step state machine)
1-3: Dispenser gives Ch1×2 → merge → Ch2. 4-5: Give Ch2 → merge → Ch3. 6-7: Drag Ch3 onto sealed Ch3 → Ch4 generator + box reveals. 8-9: Tap generator. 10-12: Give Da1×2 → merge onto sealed Da1 → Da2. 13-14: Show orders, complete first. 15: Show stash. 16-17: Tap generator again. 18: Done → free play. Orders hidden before step 13, stash hidden before step 15.

**Save data:** `progression.arena_data = {grid, stash, dispenser_queue, order_level, completed_orders, xp, tutorial_step}`. Old saves (with `board` key) auto-migrate to fresh arena start.

## Resources (resources.lua)

Two resources form the core game loop:
- **Fuel** (base cap 50, dynamic via `skill_tree.getFuelCap()`): powers arena generators (1 Fuel per tap). Earned from Coin Sort merges.
- **Stars** (uncapped): spendable progression currency for skill tree nodes. Earned from both Coin Sort merges (L4+) and Arena order/level completion. `addStars()` applies `skill_tree.getStarMultiplier()`.

Merge reward table (by resulting coin level): L2→+1fuel, L4→+1fuel+1star, L5→+2fuel+2stars, L6→+3fuel+3stars, L7→+4fuel+5stars

**Merge bonus fuel:** Controlled by skill tree nodes `mbon5` (L5+) and `mbon4` (L4+). Delegated to `skill_tree.getMergeBonusFuel()`.

Order completion rewards bags (easy:1, medium:2, hard:3 based on xp) + stars (1-3) + XP (no item rewards). Level completion rewards bags (3-5) + stars (5-10) + items.

**Fuel depletion alert:** When fuel=0 in Arena for 3+ seconds, an overlay appears offering to switch to Coin Sort. Fuel bar turns orange <10, pulses red <5.

**Save batching:** `arena.save()` calls `bags.sync()` + `resources.sync()` before single `progression.save()`. Order completion and generator taps use NoSave variants to avoid redundant disk writes.

## Bags (bags.lua)

Coin bags consumed in Coin Sort to deal coins. Free bags generate on timer (dynamic via `skill_tree.getFreeBagInterval()`, base 720s). Max queued free bags dynamic via `skill_tree.getMaxQueuedFree()` (base 2). Order rewards add bags. Fresh save starts with 5 bags. Timer ticks on all screens.

**Bag power scaling (skill tree):** base 18 coins/bag, increased by nodes `bp20`(→20), `bp22`(→22), `bp24`(→24). Extra deal coins from `cspc` node (+2). Via `bags.getBagCoins()`.

## Power-ups (powerups.lua)

- **Auto Sort** — redistributes all coins left-to-right by number type.
- **Hammer** — clears an entire column. Activates targeting mode (red overlay, click column to clear, Escape to cancel).

Both start at 100 charges (dev/testing). `coin_sort.autoSort()` returns dealing animation data. `coin_sort.clearColumn(col_idx)` returns removed coins.

## Drops (drops.lua)

Variable cross-mode reward system. Drops are rolled probabilistically on merges and order completions.

**CS merge drops → Arena:** Chest (arena item → shelf → dispenser on mode switch), Fuel Surge (+3-5 fuel), Star Burst (+2-3 stars, L4+), Generator Token (free gen tap, L5+). Chances scale with merge level.

**Arena order drops → CS:** Hammer charge, AutoSort charge, Bag Bundle (+1-2 bags), Double Merge (hard orders only), Star Burst (+2-3 stars). Chances scale with order difficulty (easy/medium/hard). Level completion always drops 1 random powerup.

**Chest system:** CS merges can drop typed Chests (one per generator chain) — the main driver of arena progression. Each chest is assigned a random unlocked generator chain (Ch/Cu/He/Bl/Ki/Ta) and visually colored to match. Drop rates are high (L3:15%, L4:20%, L5:30%, L6:40%, L7:50%). Chests appear on a shelf during CS, transfer to arena dispenser on mode switch. On the arena grid, chests can be tapped for free (no fuel cost) to produce items: 70% own chain items (L1-2), 30% food sub-chain items (L1-2). Food sub-chains: Ch→Me/Da, He→Ba, Bl→De, Ki→So, Ta→Be, Cu→none. Each tap decrements charges; chest disappears when empty. Charges scale with merge level (L3→2, L4→3, L5→4, L6→5, L7→6). Grid cell: `{state = "chest", charges = N, chain_id = "Ch"}`.

**Shelf:** Chests earned during CS session, displayed as a row on CS screen. Auto-transferred to Arena dispenser on mode switch. Infinite capacity.

**Generator Tokens:** Free generator taps stored in drops state. Used automatically before fuel on tap. Shown as "+NT" next to fuel display.

**Tab bar badges:** Red circle on inactive tab showing pending reward count from other mode.

Persistence via `progression.getDropsData()`/`setDropsData()`. Synced via `drops.sync()` in `arena.save()`.

## Commissions (commissions.lua)

2 active commissions, persistent across sessions via `progression.dat`. Two types: Forge (create specific merge results) and Harvest (accumulate resources/merges). Rewards: Bags + Stars (no Fuel). Difficulty scales by lifetime commissions completed. Collected manually via "Collect" button in the quest panel UI (in `coin_sort_screen.lua`). Batch refresh: both must be collected before new commissions generate. Commission display in `coin_sort_screen.lua` uses `commissions.getActive()` directly (not via `coin_sort.getState().commissions`).

## Skill Tree (skill_tree.lua + skill_tree_screen.lua)

PoE2-style upgrade tree replacing the old linear milestone system. Stars are **spent** (not thresholds) to unlock interconnected nodes. Player paths outward from a central `start` node through adjacent connections.

**30 nodes** in 3 tiers: Small (2-3★), Notable (5-10★), Keystone (15-25★). Total cost ~192★.

**Key upgrades:** Generator unlocks (He→`heat`, Cu→`cup`, Bl→`blnd`, Ki→`kitc`, Ta→`tblw`), fuel cap (`ffuel`), bag power (`bp20`/`bp22`/`bp24`), stash size (`stas`/`stash2`), merge fuel bonuses (`mbon5`/`mbon4`), generator charges (`gch1`/`gch2`), recharge time (`fbag1`/`fbag2`), star multiplier (`surge`), and future poison coins (`poison` — "Coming Soon").

**Query API** (used by resources, bags, arena, drops, arena_orders): `isGeneratorUnlocked()`, `getBagCoins()`, `getFuelCap()`, `getStashSize()`, `getMergeBonusFuel()`, `getGenChargeBonus()`, `getGenRechargeTime()`, `getStarMultiplier()`, etc.

**Circular dependency:** `skill_tree` ↔ `resources` solved via lazy `require()` inside functions.

**Migration:** When tree is empty but player has stars > 0, maps old milestone thresholds to tree nodes, BFS-paths for connectivity, deducts cost from current stars.

**Screen:** Full-screen pannable node graph. Accessed via tappable "Stars >" pill on both CS and Arena screens. Node detail panel slides up on tap with unlock button. Back button returns to previous screen.

**Persistence:** `progression.skill_tree_data = {unlocked = {start = true}, stars_spent = 0}`.

## Coin Sort Gameplay Screen (coin_sort_screen.lua)

**Responsive input:** only blocked during coin flight (~0.23s). Players can pick/place during merge/deal. Merge/Add buttons require full idle.

**Reset button** (top-right): hold 3 seconds to reset all progress via `progression.reset()`.

## Assets

- `/sfx/` — sound effects, `/bgnd_music/` — background music
- `/assets/` — sprites: `ball.png` (tinted per color for coins)
- `/assets/icons/` — AI-generated item sprites (256x256 RGBA PNGs), named `{chain_id}_{level}.png` (lowercase). Uses `linear` filter (overrides global `nearest`).
- `comic shanns.otf` — custom UI font

## Mobile Touch Input

`love.touchpressed` / `love.touchreleased` are intentionally **NOT defined** in `main.lua`. When absent, LÖVE automatically generates synthetic mouse events from touch — giving single-tap = single `mousepressed`. Defining touch callbacks disables this and caused double-fire (pick up + immediate return) on mobile.

**Web touch debounce:** SDL+Emscripten (love.js) fires BOTH a synthetic mouse event (`istouch=true`) AND a duplicate real mouse event (`istouch=false`) for a single touch. `main.lua` debounces this: when `istouch=true`, timestamp is recorded; any non-touch mouse event within 0.2s is ignored.

`coin_sort_screen.lua` provides `isPointerDown()` and `getPointerPosition()` helpers that check both `love.mouse` and `love.touch` for extra robustness.

## Platform Detection (mobile.lua)

- `mobile.isMobile()` — native mobile only (Android/iOS). Use for fullscreen, vibration.
- `mobile.isWeb()` — web builds (`getOS() == "Unknown"` or `"Web"`; love-web-builder returns `"Unknown"`).
- `mobile.isLowPerformance()` — true for both native mobile AND web. Use for particle reduction and other GPU optimizations.

## Performance Anti-Patterns (NEVER DO)

- **No `love.timer.sleep()` in callbacks** — NEVER call `love.timer.sleep()` inside `love.update()` or `love.draw()`. It blocks the main thread and causes system-wide freezes. LÖVE handles frame pacing via vsync automatically.
- **No manual FPS limiters** — Do not implement frame rate capping with sleep/busy-wait loops. Vsync (enabled in `conf.lua`) handles this.
- **No `love.graphics.new*()` in update/draw** — Never create canvases, images, fonts, or shaders inside per-frame callbacks. Allocate once in `love.load()` or `init()`.
- **No unbounded loops in per-frame code** — Use modulo (`%`) instead of `while` subtraction loops for timer wrapping. A subtraction loop is O(n) per frame; modulo is O(1).
- **No unbounded table growth** — Every `table.insert` in `update()`/`draw()` must have a corresponding removal path. Pre-allocate pools for particles, effects, popups.

## Mobile/Web Performance

- **No FPS cap**: update and draw run at native rate on all platforms (browser typically provides 50-60fps). Animation speed multiplier is always 4x for snappy feel.
- **Particles**: `particles.lua` uses active-list pool (O(1) alloc, update skips dead) + SpriteBatch (1 draw call for all particles). `mobile.isLowPerformance()` halves particle counts (150 max, 10 per burst, 18 per merge), reduces lifetime/bounces, and skips the per-particle highlight.
- **Graphics caching**: `graphics.lua` caches `getDimensions()` for the ball image, and `font:getWidth()`/`font:getHeight()` per font. Two-layer rendering uses step-2 iteration (no modulo per coin).
- **Canvas**: `{dpiscale = 1}` prevents oversized textures on HiDPI mobile GPUs.
