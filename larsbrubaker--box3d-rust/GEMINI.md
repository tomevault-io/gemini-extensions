# Claude Code Guidelines

## Philosophy

**Quality through iterations** - Start with correct implementations, then improve. Code that doesn't matter can be quick and dirty. But code that matters *really* matters—treat it with respect and improve it meticulously. In a porting project, every function matters.

**Circumstances alter cases** - Use judgment. There are no rigid rules—context determines the right approach. However, this project has strong defaults because porting demands precision.

**No stubs, no shortcuts** - Every function must be complete and production-ready. No `todo!()`, no `unimplemented!()`, no `panic!("not implemented")`, no partial implementations. If dependencies aren't ready, stop and implement them first.

## Test-First Bug Fixing (Critical Practice)

**This is the single most important practice for agent performance and reliability.**

When a bug is reported, always follow this workflow:

1. **Write a reproducing test first** - Create a test that fails, demonstrating the bug
2. **Fix the bug** - Make the minimal change needed to address the issue
3. **Verify via passing test** - The previously failing test should now pass

**Do not skip the reproducing test.** Even if the fix seems obvious, the test validates your understanding and prevents regressions.

## Testing

- Tests MUST test actual production code, not copies - Never duplicate production logic in tests. Import and call the real code.
- Tests should run as fast as possible—fast tests get run more often
- Write tests for regressions and complex logic
- All tests must pass before merging
- Tests must verify **exact behavioral match** with the C implementation
- Port the C test suite (`box3d-cpp-reference/test/`) module by module alongside the code it tests
- When test failures occur, use the fix-test-failures agent (`.claude/agents/fix-test-failures.md`) — it treats all failures as real bugs and resolves them through instrumentation and root cause analysis, never by weakening tests

**Running tests:**
```bash
# Run with the double-precision (large world) feature, mirroring BOX3D_DOUBLE_PRECISION
cargo test --features double-precision
```

## Code Quality

**Names** - Follow Rust conventions (`snake_case` for functions/variables, `PascalCase` for types, `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for constants). Keep names mappable to the C original: `b3ClampFloat` → `clamp_float`, `b3Vec3` → `Vec3`, `b3InvMulTransforms` → `inv_mul_transforms`. A reader diffing Rust against C should never have to guess which function corresponds to which.

**Comments** - Preserve the C source's explanatory comments (they encode Erin Catto's reasoning). Comments explaining *why* the Rust approach differs from C are especially valuable.

**Refactoring** - A tripped file-length test means split the file into real modules — never compact lines or bump the limit.

## C to Rust Porting Rules

This project is a strict port of the Box3D C library to Rust. These rules ensure fidelity:

### The C Reference

The exact source being ported is the git submodule at `box3d-cpp-reference/` (pinned, currently v0.1.0+ at `3fc20f5`). **Always read the pinned submodule, not the upstream website** — upstream moves fast (Box3D was released June 2026). Layout:

- `src/*.c` + `src/*.h` — internal implementation (the bulk of the port)
- `include/box3d/*.h` — public API and inline functions (port these with the module that owns them)
- `test/test_*.c` — the C test suite (port alongside each module)
- `samples/` — the interactive samples app (becomes the wasm demo site)
- `benchmark/` — performance tests (informs the Rust benches later)

Box3D is a 3D fork of Box2D v3. When a Box3D function is unclear, the corresponding Box2D
function (and our finished box2d-rust port at `../box2d-rust/`) is often the best Rosetta
stone — but the pinned Box3D source is always the authority.

### Exact Behavioral Matching
- Rust implementation must match C behavior exactly: same algorithms, same arithmetic, same edge cases
- **Float precision is behavior.** Box3D does all math in `f32`. Never promote to `f64` for "extra accuracy", never reorder floating-point operations, never replace `x * x + y * y` with `hypot`. `(a + b) + c ≠ a + (b + c)` in floats.
- **Determinism is a feature.** Box3D hand-rolls `b3Atan2` and `b3ComputeCosSin` specifically for cross-platform determinism. Never replace them with `f32::atan2` / `f32::sin_cos` — port the approximations bit-for-bit.
- **Port the scalar path.** Upstream has SIMD (SSE2/Neon) in `src/simd.h` with a scalar fallback selected by `BOX3D_DISABLE_SIMD` / `B3_SIMD_NONE`. The port implements the scalar (`B3_SIMD_NONE`) path — it is the behavioral reference. SIMD acceleration may come later only if it stays bit-identical to the scalar results.
- **The port is serial.** Upstream's task scheduler (`scheduler.c`, `parallel_for.c`) runs worker threads; the port executes the same work single-threaded in the same order, like box2d-rust does.
- `BOX3D_DOUBLE_PRECISION` (large world mode) maps to the `double-precision` cargo feature; both configurations must build and pass tests.
- C `B3_ASSERT` / `B3_VALIDATE` map to `debug_assert!`.
- Box3D's arena/block allocators, free lists, and index-based object pools should be ported keying by `Vec` index, never by pointer/reference juggling.

### Dependency-Ordered Implementation
Before implementing any function:
1. Read the corresponding C source to identify all functions called by the target function
2. Verify all dependencies are already implemented and tested in the Rust codebase
3. If any dependency is incomplete, implement dependencies first

Port phase-by-phase in complete, testable modules (this worked for clipper2-rust and box2d-rust; function-by-function tracking did not). The expected order mirrors box2d-rust: math_functions (now with `Vec3`/`Quat`/`Mat33`) → core/constants → id/bitset/id_pool/table/container → aabb → distance (GJK/TOI) → hull → shape geometry (sphere/capsule/box/convex hull/compound/mesh/height_field) → manifolds (convex/mesh/triangle) → dynamic_tree → types. One green module per commit.

### The Dynamics Core (body/shape/contact/joint/island/solver_set/constraint_graph/solver/world)
These C files are mutually recursive — every function takes `b3World*` and the Sim/State structs reference each other — so the module-per-commit rule cannot apply. For this unit the rules are:

1. **Data model first.** Land the complete internal data model (all structs/enums for the whole unit, including `World`) in one commit. Structs carry no logic yet; that is not a "stub" — functions are where the stub rule applies.
2. **Logic in complete C-file slices.** Port one C file's functions per commit, each function complete (no `todo!()`, no placeholder bodies). A ported function may call a function from a C file not yet ported **only if** that callee is ported in the same commit or the call is behind the not-yet-reachable public API. Every commit must compile (`cargo build`) and keep all existing tests green.
3. **Unreachable is acceptable, incomplete is not.** During bring-up, complete functions that nothing calls yet are expected (`#[allow(dead_code)]` at the module level with a `// bring-up:` note, removed when the world API lands).
4. **World tests gate completion.** `test_world.c` and `test_determinism.c` are the acceptance tests for the whole unit. The unit is not "done" until they pass; the demo site gets its first simulation samples only after that.

### Forbidden Patterns
- `todo!()` or `unimplemented!()` macros
- `panic!()` for missing functionality
- Stub functions or placeholder implementations
- Implementing without dependencies ready (outside the dynamics-core bring-up rules above)
- Marking functions complete prematurely
- "Close enough" or "good enough for now" implementations
- Guessing at divergences — when Rust and C disagree, instrument both and diff the traces (build the C reference with CMake, `BOX3D_DISABLE_SIMD=ON`, and trace both sides; never guess from code)

## Shell

This project uses **PowerShell** on Windows. Heredocs (`<<'EOF'`) don't work — use PowerShell string variables with backtick-n (`` `n ``) for newlines instead.

## Demo Site

The wasm demo site (`demo/`) will mirror the C `samples/` app: every sample category eventually gets an interactive browser demo (rendered with WebGL — Box3D scenes are 3D). Build with `bun run build` in `demo/`, develop with `bun run dev`. Deployed to GitHub Pages by `.github/workflows/deploy-demo.yml` on push to main. Until the collision layer lands, the site is a status/landing page that loads the wasm build and reports the port version — keeping the whole pipeline green from day one.

## Orchestration pattern

The main session (Fable 5) acts as planner and orchestrator only — it should not write or edit code directly. All implementation is delegated to the `implementer` subagent, one scoped step at a time. All post-change review is delegated to the `reviewer` subagent. The main session handles only planning, architecture decisions, and synthesizing subagent results.
