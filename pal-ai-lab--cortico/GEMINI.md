# AGENTS.md

Rules for working in this repository. [PHILOSOPHY.md](PHILOSOPHY.md) says what Cortico is;
this file says how work here is done. When a request conflicts with either, say so before
building.

## 1. Design stance

Read PHILOSOPHY.md before changing how an agent is prompted, given tools, given memory, or
handed context. Two of its rules settle most design questions:

- **Design toward the frontier.** A mechanism that exists only to work around a current model's
  limit is a fallback, and is written, named and documented as one.
- **Minimal priors.** Prefer a semantic instruction the agent applies with judgment over
  hard-coded control flow. Reserve control flow for what is genuinely mechanical and for cases
  where a wrong judgment is unrecoverable.

## 2. Names

| Layer | Directory | Code |
|---|---|---|
| Core | `src/core/`; assembly in `src/bot.ts` and `src/world.ts` | `Core`, `CoreApi`, `CoreConfig`, `EventEnvelope` |
| Persona | `bots/<name>/persona/` | `Persona` |
| Memory | `<deployment>/memory/`; the Persona chooses the path (Cormini and CortiV use `workspace/`) | none; Core reaches it only through a directory path and blob handles |
| World | `src/worlds/<id>/`, listed in `src/worlds/index.ts`; external ones are extensions | `World`, `WorldHost`, `WorldDefinition`, `WorldContext` |
| Bot | `bots/<name>/index.ts` | `BotDefinition`, `createBot()` |

Core-side facilities, not layers: providers (`src/providers/`, `ProviderModule`), the console
(`src/web/`), the extension loader (`src/extensions/`). An extension is an npm package that
supplies one World, one provider or one bot; those three are the extension points. A deployment
(`deployments/<name>/`) holds one bot's config, secrets, Memory and run data; none of it is
tracked.

One name all the way through: a World's config section is `worlds.<id>`, its console page id
`world:<id>`, its manifest `kind` is `world`; packages are `cortico-world-*`,
`cortico-provider-*`, `cortico-bot-*`. Chinese UI text keeps Core, Persona, Memory and World
as proper nouns, calls an extension 扩展, and calls a config value 配置. 参数 is reserved for
a tool call's arguments.

Conventions that hold across the repository:

- **One prefix per World**, the id in PascalCase (`Minecraft`, `Pvz`, `QQ`, `WebSearch`), on its
  contract exports: `<PREFIX>` definition, `<Prefix>ConfigSection`, `<PREFIX>_DEFAULTS`,
  `<PREFIX>_CONFIG_GROUP`, `<PREFIX>_TOOL_DECLS`, `<PREFIX>_PANEL_DECLS`, the `<Prefix>World`
  class and its `<Prefix>WorldProxy`. Internal helpers carry no prefix; engine-ipc types
  (`EngineInit`, `EngineRequest`, `HostRequest`, `MainToChild`) are unprefixed in every World.
- **Fixed files per World**: `definition.ts` (the definition), `config.ts` (config section,
  defaults, config groups, secret names), `world.ts` (the class); a World that runs in a child
  process adds `proxy.ts`, `engine-child.ts`, `engine-ipc.ts`. The child process is 引擎子进程 in
  prose and `engine` in identifiers. File names are kebab-case.
- **Tools** are `<id>_<verb phrase>` in snake_case (`mc_` is the fixed short form for minecraft).
  **Events** use `type` as `<id>.<noun>` with no hyphen inside a segment, `source` is the World id,
  `senderKey` is `<id>` or `<id>.<lane>`, `ts` comes from `nowIso(timezone)`.
- **Config keys**: a duration carries its stored unit (`Ms`, `Sec`, `Minutes`); a directory ends in
  `Dir`, a file in `File`; a component's switch is `enabled` inside that component's object; other
  booleans are affirmative verb phrases; caps are `max<Noun>`.
- **Types**: `Options` never `Opts`, `Context` never `Ctx`. `Definition` is what an extension point
  exports; `Decl` is what a World or Persona declares to the console; `*Host` is the surface Core
  hands a collaborator, `*Api` the surface a Persona uses on Core. Discriminant field is `kind`,
  except the event envelope's `type`. Timestamps are `*At` (ISO) or `*AtMs`; durations `*Ms`.
- **Verbs**: runtime objects `start/stop`; Core attaching a World `mount/unmount`; the assembly
  layer `activate/deactivate`; console client objects `mount/dispose`. Factories are `create*`.
  Hooks are `on<Moment>`; a World hook never shares a Persona hook's name with a different
  signature. Abbreviations allowed in locals: `req rep msg err opts cfg ctx`; one style per World.
- **Environment variables** are `CORTICO_*`. npm scripts are `<verb>:<object>`. `tests/<layer>/`
  mirrors `src/<layer>/`; a test file is named after the file it covers.

## 3. Boundaries

1. **Core is semantics-free.** `src/core/` names no kind of bot: no branching on a session id,
   no bot vocabulary, no assumption that Memory is a file tree. Bot-specific behavior is a hook
   the Persona fills in.
2. **Context text comes from the Persona.** Core writes no prose for the model; an empty hook
   produces nothing.
3. **Platform details stay in their World.** Core knows no group, friend or message id. A World
   never writes to Memory and never binds a Persona's tools.
4. **Defaults live with their owner.** Core parameters in `src/core/config.ts`, Persona choices
   in the Persona's config, World parameters in the World. A bot package may override a World's
   defaults; a deployment overrides everything. The model behind an endpoint belongs to the
   provider entry and is invisible to the Persona.
5. **Tunables are declared, never hand-built.** A knob is a JSON Schema property in its owner's
   `ConfigGroup`; the console renders it. Adding a World or a Persona leaves `src/web/**`
   byte-identical, and `tests/web/acceptance-zero-diff.test.ts` enforces that.

## 4. Writing

These rules apply to comments, documents and commit messages alike, and to what a session
reports to the operator. A sentence stays only if it carries a fact the reader needs and cannot
get from the code.

- Conclusion first, mechanism second.
- State the invariant, not the runtime story and not the negotiation that produced it. History
  belongs in git.
- No manufactured contrast ("A, not B" where nobody proposed B). No paraphrase of the request
  that produced the code. No issue, decision or section numbers.
- Do not name the bot; write "bot" when a referent is unavoidable.
- A field comment is one or two sentences on one topic. The contract goes on the interface, the
  architecture in the module header or the owning document.
- No defensive code for states the types or the caller rule out; validate at real boundaries
  only.
- No test that asserts a mock was called with a constant. Test behavior against real or
  realistically faked components; when a call count is the behavior, say so in the test name.

### AI slop checklist

Review UI copy, prompts, documentation, code comments, commit messages and reports to the
operator sentence by sentence.
Prefer deleting redundant prose. Preserve factual content in documentation; trace vague claims to
their implementation and state the actual behavior. Keep comments only when they explain facts
that cannot be inferred from the code.

- [ ] **Obvious information**: Remove common knowledge and instructions evident from the UI.
- [ ] **UI narration**: Remove descriptions of cards, groups, buttons and layout. Show state in
  status labels.
- [ ] **Long narratives**: Reduce "this happens here, so you can..." to the necessary behavior,
  condition or result.
- [ ] **Manufactured contrast**: Remove "not A but B", rhetorical turns introduced with dashes and
  emphasis that serve no actual distinction.
- [ ] **Jargon and metaphors**: Use ordinary words for concrete objects and actions. Define necessary
  terms before using them and follow the project's naming conventions.
- [ ] **Vague actions**: State what an operation changes and when it takes effect. Replace phrases
  such as "touches the disk" or "finishes up" with the actual behavior.
- [ ] **Hype and reassurance**: Remove praise for the implementation, subjective modifiers such as
  "quietly" or "reliably", and unsupported assurances such as "rest assured".
- [ ] **Incident history**: Remove accounts of incidents, fixes, defenses of old designs and
  precautionary lectures. Express constraints that still apply as current rules.
- [ ] **Layer boundaries**: Keep platform details in their World. Shared entry points do not describe
  the internal behavior of a particular World, Persona or bot.
- [ ] **Misplaced information**: Put information needed for operation in the UI, contracts at
  interfaces, architecture in modules or their documentation, and history in git.
- [ ] **Repeated explanations**: State each fact only where needed. Check duplicate copy and other
  language versions during cleanup.
- [ ] **Accuracy after editing**: Verify retained behavior, conditions, units and boundaries.
  Necessary consequences, error causes and recovery steps must remain accurate and specific.

## 5. Tests

- Assert the contract, not incidental values: compare with the exported default, not a literal.
- Real components: real git repos, real ports, a real event store. Only the LLM is scripted.
- Fixtures and documentation examples name no real vendor or model. Which model runs behind an
  endpoint is a deployment fact, and a fixture that copies one pins that fact into the repository.
  The shipped default endpoint and the extension package names are the exception: they name
  something real in order to work at all.
- No network in tests. Real-service checks live in `scripts/` and run by hand.

## 6. Commands

- `pnpm test` and `pnpm run typecheck` are green before every commit; browser code is checked by
  `pnpm typecheck:web`.
- `pnpm build:web` after changing `src/web/client/`, `src/web/shared/` or any
  `console/client.ts`. Never while a bot process is alive on this machine: the running console
  serves the bundle being overwritten.
- Never start a real bot to verify a change. Use tests, `pnpm dev:console` (fake data) or a
  script under `scratch/`.
- `pnpm logq` queries run logs; `pnpm check:extension <dir>` validates an extension package;
  `pnpm audit:release` runs the release audit.

## 7. Scratch

Disposable work (probes, one-off scripts, dumps, experiments) goes under `scratch/`
(gitignored), never into `scripts/`, `src/`, `bots/` or another tracked tree. Promote it
deliberately when it becomes a tool.

## 8. Documentation

- Every page under `docs/` and every README of a code unit names, in its first line, the file
  or interface it shadows: its owner. The commit that changes the owner changes the page.
- Text without a code owner (plans, migration records, decision history) lives in `scratch/`
  while active and in `deprecated/` when retired. Both are gitignored.
- PHILOSOPHY.md is exempt: it is written for a first-time reader and may repeat other files.

## 9. Git

- Commit at every milestone: a change stated in one sentence that leaves
  `pnpm test && pnpm run typecheck` green. Smaller than a feature, larger than one file; an
  additive step and its migration are two commits.
- Stage by explicit path. Other sessions may have uncommitted work in this tree, so
  `git add -A`, `git add .` and `git commit -a` are never used.
- Committing is not pushing. Push, open pull requests or rewrite published history only when
  asked.

### Message format

Conventional Commits, `<type>(<scope>): <description>`, type and scope always lowercase ASCII.
Commits made before this rule do not follow it and are not rewritten.

| Type | Covers |
|---|---|
| `feat` | a capability the operator, the Persona or an extension author did not have |
| `fix` | wrong behavior; the body names the root cause and what proves it gone |
| `refactor` | same behavior, different shape: renames, extractions, deletions |
| `perf` | measured; the body carries the before and the after |
| `docs` | `docs/`, a README, AGENTS.md, PHILOSOPHY.md, or comments alone |
| `test` | tests alone |
| `build` | package.json, the lockfile, tsconfig, bundling |
| `ci` | `.github/` |
| `chore` | what the list above misses and a reader needs nothing from; rare |
| `revert` | subject repeats the reverted subject, body is `This reverts commit <sha>.` |

The scope is the unit the change lives in, written as its path with `src/` dropped: `core`,
`worlds/pvz`, `providers/llamacpp`, `extensions`, `bots/cortiv`, `console` for `src/web/`. A
one-file change may use the file's own name (`package.json`, `ci.yml`). Omit the scope only for
a repository-wide change; a commit that wants two scopes is two commits.

The description says what changed and why, under 72 characters for the whole subject line, no
trailing period. Its language is free; the type and the scope stay English. Body bullets carry
what the diff does not show: the rejected alternative, the invariant relied on, what the tests
now cover.

A change to an on-disk layout, to a config key or to the meaning of already written content
takes a `!` before the colon and a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer naming the migration that ships
with it.

```
feat(core)!: hardTokens moves to the Core config

BREAKING CHANGE: persona.hardTokens is read from core.hardTokens. scripts/migrate-hard-tokens.ts
rewrites a deployment's config in place; dry run by default, backup before writing.
```
