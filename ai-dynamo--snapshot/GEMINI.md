# AGENTS.md

Guidance for AI coding agents working in this repository. Human contributors
should start with [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md); everything there applies
here too.

> Note: "agent" in this file means an AI coding assistant. The `agent/` module
> is a different thing entirely — the node-level Snapshot agent daemon.

## What this project is

Snapshot is a Kubernetes-native checkpoint and restore system for NVIDIA GPU
workloads. It checkpoints a fully initialized GPU pod — running process, CPU and
GPU memory — and restores that state on another compatible node. It provides
primitives, not orchestration.

## Agent skills

Repository agent skills live in `.agents/skills/` and are versioned with the
checkout. Use the `snep` skill when drafting or revising a Snapshot Enhancement
Proposal (SNEP); it guides the proposal section by section and follows the
process in `docs/proposals/README.md`.

## Repository layout

| Path | Go module | What lives there |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `api/` | yes | CRD types (`PodSnapshot`, `PodSnapshotContent`, `SnapshotJob`) and generated CRD YAML in `api/v1alpha1/crds` |
| `agent/` | yes | Node-level daemon that drives CRIU and CUDA checkpointing. **Linux/amd64 only** |
| `operator/` | yes | Cluster controller that reconciles the CRDs |
| `charts/snapshot/` | — | Helm chart; `charts/snapshot/crds` is a generated copy of the CRDs |
| `e2e/` | — | Python end-to-end suite (uv/pyproject), not Go |
| `docs/` | — | User and developer documentation |
| `hack/` | — | Build tooling, license boilerplate, base-package capture |

Three separate Go modules — `api`, `agent`, and `operator` — each with its own
`go.mod` and its own `Makefile`. The root `Makefile` fans out to all three.

## Build and test

Run everything from the repository root. Go 1.27.1 — the version is pinned in
`hack/tools.mk`, `go.work`, all three `go.mod` files, `agent/Dockerfile`, and
the workflows, and they must agree.

```bash
make check        # default goal: the full local gate (see below)
make test         # unit tests across api, agent, operator
make build        # build agent and operator binaries
make lint         # golangci-lint across all three modules
make fmt          # format
make generate     # regenerate CRDs from api/ types
```

`make check` is the one that matters before opening a pull request. It runs, in
order: `verify-crds`, `install-tools`, `generate`, `pagebroker-check-generated`,
`add-license-headers`, `fmt`, `tidy`, `verify-license-headers`, `lint`,
`govulncheck`, and `helm-lint`. It deliberately does not run in parallel
(`.NOTPARALLEL:`) because the stages mutate files that later stages read.

To scope work to one module, use its own Makefile — `make -C operator test`.

### Building the agent from macOS

The agent is Linux/amd64-only (`cuda-checkpoint` ships no other architecture),
so it does not build natively on a Mac. Use the containerized targets:

```bash
make linux-build   # builds agent/ inside a golang container
make linux-test    # runs agent/ tests inside a golang container
```

Both require Docker.

## Conventions that will fail CI if you miss them

1. **Every commit must be signed off (DCO).** Use `git commit -s`. Unsigned
   commits fail the DCO check and cannot be merged. See
   [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#developer-certificate-of-origin-dco).

2. **Every pull request must link an approved issue.** The
   `Validate Issue Reference` check fails when a pull request references no
   issue, or only issues that are closed or not yet labeled `approved`. Open the
   issue first and wait for a maintainer to apply `approved` before investing
   significant work. Do not open a pull request that skips this step.

3. **SPDX license headers are required on new files.** `make add-license-headers`
   adds them from `hack/boilerplate.addlicense.txt`; `verify-license-headers`
   checks them in CI. Generated CRDs are exempt.

4. **CRDs are generated, not hand-edited.** Edit the types under `api/v1alpha1`,
   then run `make generate`. The chart copy in `charts/snapshot/crds` must stay
   in sync with `api/v1alpha1/crds` — `verify-crds` fails on drift and tells you
   to run `make generate` and commit the result.

5. **The agent base image is pinned in one place.** `AGENT_BASE_IMAGE` is read
   out of `agent/Dockerfile`. If you change it, re-run
   `make capture-base-packages` so the committed package baseline matches;
   `verify-base-packages` enforces this.

## Preferred and deprecated patterns

Concrete examples of the shape a change should take here. Each is enforced
somewhere — a linter, a `make` target, or a CI job — so getting it wrong shows
up as a failure rather than a review comment.

**Read the control directory from the canonical environment variable.**
`LegacySnapshotControlDirEnv` exists only so workload images built against the
old name keep working during the migration window. New code must not read it;
`operator/.golangci.yml` scopes the deprecation exclusion to the single file
allowed to reference it.

```go
// Good
dir := os.Getenv(podcontract.SnapshotControlDirEnv)        // SNAPSHOT_CONTROL_DIR

// Bad — deprecated, kept only for backward compatibility
dir := os.Getenv(podcontract.LegacySnapshotControlDirEnv)  // DYN_SNAPSHOT_CONTROL_DIR
```

**Log through the context logger, not stdout.** Reconcilers get a logger
carrying the request's identity; printing loses it. There is no `fmt.Print` in
`operator/internal` or `agent/internal` — do not add the first one.

```go
// Good
log.FromContext(ctx).Error(err, "Failed to list PodSnapshots", "pod", key)

// Bad — no request context, invisible to log scraping
fmt.Printf("failed to list PodSnapshots for %s: %v\n", key, err)
```

**Generate CRDs; never hand-edit them.** `verify-crds` diffs the two copies and
fails on drift.

```sh
# Good — edit the Go types, then regenerate both copies
vim api/v1alpha1/podsnapshot_types.go && make generate

# Bad — the next `make generate` overwrites it, and CI fails first
vim charts/snapshot/crds/nvidia.com_podsnapshots.yaml
```

**Pin base images by digest.** A tag is mutable, so the image that ships is
whatever the registry served that day. Docker resolves `tag@digest` by digest
and never validates the tag against it, so the two must move together.

```dockerfile
# Good
FROM ubuntu:24.04@sha256:224a1869083a311ef3f13648a154ba79832fbef6364d31493642ca03082da254

# Bad — mutable tag
FROM ubuntu:24.04
```

**Move the Go toolchain version everywhere at once.** Bumping one place leaves
the shipped binary built by a toolchain CI never validated, so
`.github/dependabot.yml` ignores major and minor updates to the `golang` image
specifically to stop that happening automatically.

```sh
# Good — find every reference first, change them together
rg -l '1\.27\.1' go.work */go.mod hack/tools.mk agent/Dockerfile .github/workflows

# Bad — the operator now builds on a toolchain nothing else agrees with
vim operator/Dockerfile   # FROM golang:1.28-alpine
```

## Secrets and credentials

**Never commit credentials, secrets, API keys, tokens, kubeconfigs, or `.env`
files.** This repository contains none, and no change should introduce any.
Specifically:

- Do not add a `.env` file, a kubeconfig, a cloud credential file, or a private
  key to the tree, and do not paste any of them into code, tests, fixtures,
  comments, commit messages, or pull request descriptions.
- Do not hardcode a registry password, GitHub token, or NGC/NVIDIA API key.
  Workflows read credentials from GitHub Actions secrets
  (`${{ secrets.* }}`); local runs read them from your own environment.
- Do not echo secrets in workflow `run:` blocks or test output — a value printed
  in a public CI log is disclosed.
- Test fixtures use obviously fake placeholders. Never copy a real token into
  one, even an expired one.
- If you find a committed secret, do not fix it in a public pull request. Treat
  it as a vulnerability and follow [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md); the credential
  needs rotating, and a public commit reverting it advertises the leak.

When a task genuinely needs a credential, read it from an environment variable
and document the variable name — never the value.

## Working style

- Match the surrounding code. The repository favors explanatory comments on
  non-obvious decisions — see the `.NOTPARALLEL:` and `AGENT_BASE_IMAGE`
  comments in the root `Makefile` for the register to aim for.
- Add or update tests alongside behavior changes. Controller logic under
  `agent/internal` and `operator/internal` has substantial table-driven test
  coverage; follow the existing patterns rather than inventing new harnesses.
- Do not edit generated files (`zz_generated*.go`, both CRD directories).
- Do not bump dependencies as a side effect of an unrelated change; Dependabot
  handles routine updates.
- Never put a security vulnerability in a public issue or pull request — follow
  [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
