# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Dosu CLI (`@dosu/cli`) — a CLI tool that manages MCP (Model Context Protocol) server integrations for AI tools (Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code, Windsurf, Zed, etc.). It authenticates users via browser-based OAuth against Supabase, selects a Dosu deployment, and writes MCP server entries into each AI tool's config file.

## Commands

```bash
bun install                     # Install dependencies
bun run dev                     # Run CLI from source (loads .env.development; Bun's NODE_ENV default)
bun run dev:local               # Run CLI from source (local dev endpoints, DOSU_DEV=true)
bun run build                   # Compile to single binary via bun build --compile
bun run build:npm               # Bundle for npm distribution (bin/dosu.js)
bun run build:all               # Cross-platform build matrix

bun run test                    # Run all tests (vitest, forks pool)
bun run test:watch              # Run tests in watch mode
bunx vitest run src/config      # Run tests for a single module
bunx vitest run src/auth/flow   # Run a specific test file

bun run typecheck               # TypeScript type checking (tsc --noEmit)
bun run lint                    # Lint with Biome
bun run format                  # Format with Biome
bun run check                   # Biome lint + format check (used in CI)
```

## Architecture

**Entry point:** `src/index.ts` → `src/cli/cli.ts` (Commander program)

Running `dosu` with no args launches the interactive TUI (`src/tui/tui.ts`). Two broad families of subcommands are registered in `src/cli/cli.ts`:

- **Local / MCP management** — `login`, `logout`, `status`, `setup`, `mcp add|list`, `logs`.
- **Dosu platform** (require an authenticated deployment) — `ask`, `knowledge`, `docs`, `suggest`, `threads`, `review`, `sources`, `integrations`, `tags`, `members`, `org`, `deployments`, `analytics`, `insights`, `skill`, `hooks`. Each lives in `src/commands/<name>.ts` and talks to the backend via `src/client/`.

Key modules:

- **`src/auth/`** — Browser-based OAuth flow. Starts a local HTTP server on a random port, opens the browser to the Dosu web app, receives the token via redirect callback. `ticket.ts` backs the agent ticket flow (`login --request`/`--check`).
- **`src/client/`** — Authenticated HTTP client for the Dosu backend API. Handles token refresh (Supabase `/auth/v1/token`) and auto-retry on 401/403.
- **`src/config/`** — CLI's own config (`~/.config/dosu-cli/config.json`). Stores access/refresh tokens, deployment ID, API key. Supports OSS vs Cloud `mode`. `constants.ts` has env-aware URL getters (dev vs prod, overridable via env vars).
- **`src/mcp/`** — Provider system for AI tool integrations. Each provider in `providers/` knows how to detect, install, and remove the Dosu MCP entry from that tool's config file. `base.ts` provides `createJSONProvider()` — a factory that covers most tools with just config path + top-level key. `config-helpers.ts` handles JSON/JSONC read/write. `detect.ts` handles path expansion and platform-aware detection.
- **`src/commands/`** — The Dosu platform command layer (the list above). Thin Commander wrappers over `src/client/` calls; `output.ts` standardizes human vs JSON output.
- **`src/setup/`** — Interactive setup wizard (authenticate → select org → select deployment → mint API key → detect installed tools → configure). Uses `@clack/prompts`.
- **`src/agent/`** — Non-interactive setup for coding agents (`setup --agent --tool <id>`) and the ticket-based login commands (`login --request`/`--check`). Emits machine-readable JSON via `output.ts` for agent consumption.
- **`src/hooks/`** — Coding-agent hook entrypoints invoked as `dosu hooks <user-prompt-submit|post-tool-use|stop>`. They mint, poll, and inject Dosu "knowledge tickets" into an agent's turn. These run on the agent's hot path on every turn, so they must stay fast and keep stdout clean — `src/cli/cli.ts` deliberately skips the update checks for them.
- **`src/tui/`** — Main menu TUI when running `dosu` with no subcommand.
- **`src/version/`** — Version string from build-time env vars (`DOSU_VERSION`, `DOSU_COMMIT`, `DOSU_DATE`), plus background update checks (`update-check.ts`, `skill-update-check.ts`).

## CLI Contract Discipline

All tRPC calls MUST be typed through the generated contract (`CliApiClient` / `TypedClient` from `src/generated/dosu-api-types.d.ts`). Never hand-write client shapes — no `TypedClient & {...}` intersections and no local `{ query(input: ...) }` / `{ mutate(input: ...) }` interfaces. Hand shapes compile against procedures the backend may not serve, turning a missing route into a production 404 instead of a type error (how `dosu review` broke in v0.29.0). If a procedure is missing from the contract, register it in `cliRouter` (dosu repo, `frontend/packages/api/src/cli-root.ts`), regenerate, and re-vendor the contract. Enforced by `src/client/contract-discipline.test.ts`.

## Testing

- Tests live alongside source files as `*.test.ts`
- Vitest with `pool: "forks"` (not threads) — required for tests that mock `node:fs`
- Coverage thresholds enforced: 95% statements, 90% branches, 80% functions, 95% lines
- Build scripts in `scripts/` also have their own tests
- **Mocking a class that's constructed with `new`** (e.g. `Client`): the `vi.fn()` implementation must be a regular `function`, not an arrow — Vitest 4 cannot `new` an arrow. `biome.json` turns off `complexity/useArrowFunction` for `*.test.ts` so the linter's auto-fix can't rewrite these back to arrows and rebreak the tests.

## Dependencies & Packaging

- **`bun.lock` is committed.** It pins the full transitive tree for reproducible installs across machines and CI. Run `bun update` to bump deps (this is also where the install gate below applies).
- **`bunfig.toml` sets `minimumReleaseAge = 259200`** (3 days) — `bun install`/`bun update` ignore package versions published in the last 3 days, a supply-chain delay against compromised fresh releases. Add `minimumReleaseAgeExcludes = [...]` if a package ever needs to bypass it.
- **The published npm package is a self-contained bundle.** `build:npm` runs `bun build --target node`, which inlines every dependency into `bin/dosu.js` (the only code file shipped — see `files` in `package.json`). Because nothing is resolved from `node_modules` at runtime, **all deps live in `devDependencies` and the package declares zero runtime `dependencies`** — so `npm install @dosu/cli` pulls no transitive packages. Keep new runtime deps in `devDependencies`; only add a real `dependencies` entry if something genuinely cannot be bundled (e.g. a native binary), and verify with the isolated-bundle run before doing so.

## Code Style (Biome)

- 2-space indent, double quotes, semicolons, trailing commas, arrow parens always
- Line width: 100
- Biome recommended lint rules enabled

## Commit Convention

This project uses [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) for automated versioning and publishing. **Only commits that follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) will be recognized by the release pipeline.** Non-conforming commit messages are invisible to semantic-release and will NOT trigger a version bump.

### Format

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

```

### Types and their release impact

| Type | Release | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| `fix:` | patch (0.0.x) | `fix: handle empty config file without crash` |
| `feat:` | minor (0.x.0) | `feat: add OSS mode support to setup flow` |
| `fix!:` / `feat!:` | **major (x.0.0)** | `feat!: remove legacy auth flow` |
| `docs:` | none | `docs: update README with new CLI flags` |
| `chore:` | none | `chore: upgrade vitest to v3` |
| `refactor:` | none | `refactor: extract provider factory` |
| `test:` | none | `test: add coverage for MCP config edge cases` |
| `ci:` | none | `ci: upgrade GitHub Actions to v6` |

Scopes are optional: `fix(config): handle empty file without crash`

## Release Channels

semantic-release publishes on every push to a release branch. Two channels are configured (`release.config.js`):

| Branch | npm dist-tag | Version shape | Install with |
|---|---|---|---|
| `main` | `latest` | `0.11.0` | `npx @dosu/cli setup` |
| `alpha` | `alpha` | `0.11.0-alpha.1` | `npx @dosu/cli@alpha setup` |

The `alpha` channel is for **internal pre-release / dogfooding**. Workflow:

```bash
# Cut an alpha branch off main when you want internal testers to try a feature.
git checkout -b alpha
git push -u origin alpha

# From then on, every conventional commit pushed to `alpha` cuts a new prerelease:
#   feat: something  → 0.11.0-alpha.1
#   fix: ...         → 0.11.0-alpha.2
#
# When ready to graduate, merge `alpha` into `main` — semantic-release rolls the
# version forward to a stable 0.11.0 on the `latest` tag.
```

`update-homebrew` is intentionally skipped for prereleases — the gate is `!contains(version, '-')` in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

## Environment Variables

### Build-time defaults (baked into the bundle)

These are read by `scripts/build-all.ts:buildDefines()` and inlined as string literals via `bun build --define` at compile time. The published npm bundle contains the build-time values verbatim — they cannot be changed at runtime.

- `DOSU_WEB_APP_URL`, `DOSU_BACKEND_URL`, `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` — sourced from `.env.production` for prod builds, `.env.development` for `bun run dev:local`
- `DOSU_VERSION`, `DOSU_COMMIT`, `DOSU_DATE` — injected at build time for version info

### Runtime overrides

These are read **on every CLI invocation** and take precedence over the baked-in defaults. Useful for repointing a published `@alpha` build at staging/local backends without rebuilding.

- `DOSU_WEB_APP_URL_OVERRIDE`
- `DOSU_BACKEND_URL_OVERRIDE`
- `SUPABASE_URL_OVERRIDE`
- `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY_OVERRIDE`

Example:

```bash
DOSU_WEB_APP_URL_OVERRIDE=https://staging.dosu.dev \
DOSU_BACKEND_URL_OVERRIDE=https://api-staging.dosu.dev \
SUPABASE_URL_OVERRIDE=https://staging.supabase.co \
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY_OVERRIDE=eyJ... \
npx @dosu/cli@alpha setup
```

### Other runtime env

- `DOSU_DEV=true` — isolates the CLI's config dir to `~/.config/dosu-cli-dev/` so dev runs don't clobber prod credentials. Does **not** switch URLs (URLs are build-time-baked; use `*_OVERRIDE` for that).

## Dosu

Shared team knowledge lives in [Dosu](https://dosu.dev), via the Dosu MCP server.

- Before a task, and for any codebase or docs questions: pull context with `read_knowledge` before digging through source.
- After a task: save durable learnings with `write_knowledge`.

Missing these tools? Run `dosu setup --help` — it covers agent-assisted setup.
