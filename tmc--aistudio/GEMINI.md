# AIStudio Development Guide

## Recent Code Quality Improvements (September 2025)

### Mutex Copy Issue Fixes

Fixed critical mutex copying issues throughout the codebase:

- **Session Storage**: Refactored `ListSessions` to return `[]*Session` instead of copying sessions containing mutexes
- **Video Streaming**: Changed `PerformanceMetrics` to use pointer type to avoid copying mutex-containing structs
- **Tool Iteration**: Updated tool loops to avoid copying `RegisteredTool` structs with embedded protobuf mutexes
- **Reduced Issues**: Decreased mutex copy warnings from 26+ to 22 through systematic refactoring

### Enhanced Navigation Features

Added comprehensive reverse navigation support:

- **Shift+Tab Navigation**: Complete reverse focus navigation between input/viewport/settings
- **Tool Approval Navigation**: Shift+Tab navigates backwards through pending tool approvals

## Testing with it2 (iTerm2 CLI)

### Useful it2 Commands for Testing AIStudio

The `it2` tool is excellent for automated testing of terminal applications like aistudio. Here are the most useful commands:

#### Creating Test Sessions
```bash
# Split current session horizontally
it2 session split "$ITERM_SESSION_ID" --horizontal --profile "Default"

# Split current session vertically
it2 session split "$ITERM_SESSION_ID" --vertical --profile "Default"

# The split command returns the new session ID for use in subsequent commands
```

#### Sending Commands to Sessions
```bash
# Send text to a specific session
it2 session send-text "SESSION_ID" "command to run"

# Send special keys
it2 session send-key "SESSION_ID" enter
it2 session send-key "SESSION_ID" ctrl-c
it2 session send-key "SESSION_ID" tab
it2 session send-key "SESSION_ID" escape
```

#### Monitoring Session Output
```bash
# Get current screen content - ALWAYS use this to verify state
it2 text get-screen "SESSION_ID"

# Get last N lines of output
it2 text get-screen "SESSION_ID" | tail -20

# Search for specific text in output
it2 text get-screen "SESSION_ID" | grep "search term"
```

#### Session Management
```bash
# List all sessions with details
it2 session list --format json

# Close a session
it2 session close "SESSION_ID"

# Get session info
it2 session get-info "SESSION_ID"
```

### Testing AIStudio Workflow Example

```bash
# 1. Create a new test pane
NEW_SESSION=$(it2 session split "$ITERM_SESSION_ID" --horizontal --profile "Default" | grep -o '[A-F0-9-]*$')

# 2. Launch aistudio with a test message
it2 session send-text "$NEW_SESSION" "aistudio -auto-send 3s 'Test question'"

# 3. Wait and check the output
sleep 5
it2 text get-screen "$NEW_SESSION" | tail -30

# 4. Send additional input
it2 session send-text "$NEW_SESSION" "Follow-up message"
it2 session send-key "$NEW_SESSION" enter

# 5. Monitor response
sleep 3
it2 text get-screen "$NEW_SESSION"

# 6. Clean up
it2 session send-key "$NEW_SESSION" ctrl-c
it2 session close "$NEW_SESSION"
```

### Best Practices for it2 Testing

1. **Always verify state with get-screen**: Before and after sending commands, use `it2 text get-screen` to confirm the current state
2. **Add delays between operations**: Use `sleep` to allow time for commands to execute and output to appear
3. **Check session existence**: Sessions may close unexpectedly, always verify with `it2 session list`
4. **Use explicit session IDs**: Don't rely on environment variables that may not be available in all contexts
5. **Clean up test sessions**: Always close test sessions when done to avoid clutter

### Common Testing Patterns

#### Testing Interactive Mode
```bash
# Start aistudio in interactive mode
it2 session send-text "$SESSION" "aistudio"
sleep 3  # Wait for initialization

# Send a message
it2 session send-text "$SESSION" "Your message here"
it2 session send-key "$SESSION" enter

# Check response
sleep 5
it2 text get-screen "$SESSION"
```

#### Testing with Different Models
```bash
# Test with specific model
it2 session send-text "$SESSION" "aistudio -model 'gemini-2.5-flash'"

# Test model listing
it2 session send-text "$SESSION" "aistudio -list-models"
```

#### Testing stdin Mode
```bash
# Test stdin mode with pipe
it2 session send-text "$SESSION" "echo 'Test input' | aistudio --stdin"
```

## Tool Rendering Improvements

This document also summarizes the improvements made to the tool call rendering system in aistudio.

## Key Changes Implemented

1. **Separation of Data and View**: Created a `ToolCallViewModel` struct to separate data from presentation.
   - Centralized tool state management
   - Easier to maintain and update UI elements

2. **Centralized Status Display**: Extracted the status to glyph mapping to a central function 
   - `toolStatusGlyph` function provides consistent status indicators across the UI
   - Spinner animation is now consistent anywhere it's used

3. **ANSI Code Handling**: Added `StripANSI` function to clean output from tools
   - Prevents broken rendering due to terminal escape codes
   - Improves readability of tool outputs

4. **Empty Message Prevention**: Enhanced the rendering pipeline to skip empty messages
   - Checks both the content and its formatted representation
   - Prevents empty boxes from appearing in the UI

5. **Semantic UI Components**: Created specialized rendering helpers
   - `renderToolCallHeader`, `renderToolArgs`, `renderToolResult`
   - Consistent styling across all tool-related UI elements

6. **Better Tool Approval Flow**: Improved the tool approval modal and handlers
   - Redesigned with a dialog-style UI with numbered options
   - Option to approve specific tool types permanently (auto-approve)
   - Auto-approved tools execute without prompting for future calls
   - More consistent error handling for rejected tools
   - Support for keyboard shortcuts (1, 2, 3, Y, N, Esc)
   - Global toggle with Ctrl+A to enable/disable all tool approvals
   - Centralized approval logic across all tool call paths
   - Maintains pre-approved tool types for frequent workflows

7. **Tool Cache**: Added a cache for tool call view models
   - Prevents duplicate tool calls with the same ID
   - Maintains state across different points in the UI

8. **Border Policy**: Only render borders around content that has actual visible text
   - Prevents empty or whitespace-only bordered boxes
   - Uses the cleaned output to check if content is worth displaying

## Usage Guidelines

- Always use the ViewModel pattern for new tool-related features
- Remember to strip ANSI codes before display
- Use the centralized styling system in aistudio_view.go
- Pass unique tool call IDs to prevent duplication

## Future Enhancement Ideas

- Add progress streaming for long-running tools
- Implement proper theme support with light/dark variations
- Add snapshot tests for tool rendering
- Support richer output formats (like Markdown or HTML)

## Connection Resilience Improvements

Added robust connection handling and retry logic:

1. **Enhanced Error Classification**: Categorizes network errors to apply the most appropriate recovery strategy
   - Socket descriptor issues, connection resets, timeouts, etc. are detected and handled specifically

2. **Improved Connection Cleanup**: Thorough cleanup between connection attempts
   - Properly closes streams and cancels contexts before new attempts
   - Adds small delays to allow OS to reclaim socket resources
   - Prevents socket descriptor leaks during retries

3. **Context Management**: Better context handling for each connection attempt
   - Uses fresh timeout contexts for each connection attempt
   - Prevents context carry-over issues between retries

4. **Client Reset Logic**: More thorough client reset between attempts
   - Full teardown and recreation of client resources
   - Proper cleanup of network connections

5. **Keepalive Mechanism**: Added a connection keepalive system that sends periodic pings
   - Configurable keepalive interval (default: 5 minutes)
   - Automatic reconnection if keepalive fails
   - No user-visible interruption during reconnections

6. **Robust gRPC Connection Settings**: Enhanced connection settings with proper keepalive and backoff
   - Configurable keepalive parameters (20s keepalive time, 10s timeout)
   - Proper gRPC backoff configuration using recommended settings
   - Minimum connect timeout of 20 seconds to allow for slow connections
   - Fixed incompatible HTTP/gRPC option combinations

7. **Non-Zero Exit Code**: Added functionality to exit with a non-zero code if initial connection fails
   - Improves usability in automated environments and scripts
   - Provides proper error signaling for integrations

8. **Comprehensive End-to-End Testing Suite**: Added proper Go test suite for complete connectivity validation
   - Go-native E2E tests for reliable automated validation
   - Binary initialization test verifies application startup
   - Message streaming tests verify bidirectional communication
   - Connection stability tests with multiple keepalive checks
   - Error handling tests verify graceful recovery
   - Native library tests verify direct API client functionality
   - Proper test organization with subtests for focused testing
   - Environment variable-controlled skip functionality for tests requiring API keys
   - README documentation for running and extending tests

## Running Tests

To run all tests, including standard unit tests:
```bash
go test ./...
```

To run environment-dependent tests:
```bash
# Run all E2E and integration tests that need real API connectivity
export AISTUDIO_RUN_E2E_TESTS=1 
go test ./...

# Run timing-sensitive tests that might be flaky on slow systems
export AISTUDIO_RUN_TIMING_TESTS=1
go test ./api -run TestRetry
```

### Live Model Test Matrix

A comprehensive test matrix has been implemented to verify WebSocket connectivity for live models:

```bash
# To run just the live model WebSocket tests:
./run_live_model_tests.sh
```

The test matrix covers these configurations:
- All live models (gemini-2.0-flash-live-001, gemini-2.5-flash-live, etc.)
- Both protocols (WebSocket and gRPC)
- Both backends (Gemini API and Vertex AI)
- Control cases with non-live models

Test cases include:
1. Live models with WebSocket enabled
2. Live models with gRPC (WebSocket disabled)
3. Live models with Vertex AI
4. Non-live models with WebSocket (should fail gracefully)
5. Non-live models with gRPC
6. Non-live models with Vertex AI

These tests ensure that the `--ws` flag properly enables WebSocket mode for live models while maintaining backward compatibility.
