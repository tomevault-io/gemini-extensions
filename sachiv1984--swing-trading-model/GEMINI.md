# CLAUDE.md — System Anchor

## 0. On Every Session Start

Before doing anything else:

1. Read `.claude_current_state.json`
2. Report the `active_cycle`, `status`, and `engine` to the user
3. If status is `Blocked`: do not proceed with any governed routine — surface the open escalations and halt
4. If context has been compacted (`/compact` was used), re-read `.claude_current_state.json` and the active prompt file before proceeding

Do not infer state from conversation history. Always read the file.

## 1. Governance Engines (Demand-Loaded)

These prompts are **not** always-on context. They are loaded by Claude Code when the corresponding command is issued. Each prompt file contains full instructions — read the file, then execute.

| Command | Prompt File | Phase / Trigger |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| `run ideas [--window-id <id>] [--mode strict\|standard]` | `claude/system/idea_intake_prompt.md` | Phase 0 — Idea intake (optional, before rebalance) |
| *(auto)* | `claude/system/idea_intake_prompt.md` | Invoked as STEP -1.6 of `run roadmap` when fewer than 20 open ideas (`Submitted` or `Parked-cycle-<n>`) exist in `claude/ideas/submissions/`. Standalone `run ideas` remains supported for explicit window control. |
| `run roadmap --item-id <id> --item-name <n> [--date YYYY-MM-DD] [--dry-run]` | `claude/system/roadmap_prompt.md` | Phase 1 — Roadmap rebalance (roadmap item completed) |
| `run roadmap --reason "scheduled" [--date YYYY-MM-DD] [--dry-run]` | `claude/system/roadmap_prompt.md` | Phase 1 — Roadmap rebalance (scheduled review, no completion event required) |
| `manage roadmap [--dry-run]` | `claude/system/roadmap_management_prompt.md` | Phase 1M — Retire completed items, flag stale |
| `groom backlog [--dry-run]` | `claude/system/backlog_management_prompt.md` | Phase 1M — Archive completed backlog items, health check |
| `plan release --version <vX.Y> [--date YYYY-MM-DD]` or `run planning v<version>` | `claude/system/release_planning_prompt.md` | Phase 1B — Release planning |
| `run design-gate --cycle <cycle_id> [--dry-run]` | `claude/system/design_gate_prompt.md` | Phase 1.5 — Design gate (after Phase 1B, before Phase 2) |
| `plan sprint [--cycle <cycle_id>] [--mode strict\|standard] [--dry-run]` | `claude/system/sprint_planning_prompt.md` | Phase 2 — Sprint planning |
| `amend cycle --cycle <cycle_id> --reason <reason> [--mode strict\|standard]` | `claude/system/amendment_cycle_prompt.md` | Amendment — Emergency only, before Phase 2 seals |
| `run sprint [--cycle <cycle_id>] [--epic <EPIC-xx>] [--item <ST-xx>] [--mode strict\|standard]` | `claude/system/execution_prompt.md` | Phase 3 — Sprint execution |
| `run delivery verification [--cycle <cycle_id>] [--mode strict\|standard]` | `claude/system/delivery_verification_prompt.md` | Phase 4 — Delivery verification |
| `run post-ship [--cycle <cycle_id>] [--mode strict\|standard] [--dry-run]` | `claude/system/post_ship_closure.md` | Post-Ship — Close cycle, apply lessons learnt |
| `sync gh` | *(inline — see §4)* | Sync backlog slice to GitHub Issues |
| `run audit` | `claude/audit.py` | Governance — lifecycle audit (every 3 cycles; output filed as `claude/cycles/<cycle_id>/audit_report_AUD-<date>.md` Class 3) |

When a command is issued, **read the prompt file first**, then begin execution. Do not rely on memory of the prompt's contents from a previous session.

## 2. Governance Non-Negotiables (Always Active)

These rules apply in every session regardless of which engine is running:

- **Never modify sealed artefacts.** Files marked `sealed: true` in state.json, or in `Published` state, are immutable.
- **Never modify governance files** unless explicitly instructed by the relevant prompt: `claude/charter/`, `claude/strategy/`, `claude/system/`. Exception: `claude/system/prompt_change_log.md` may be appended by the roadmap engine's STEP 11 when action-now patches are applied under Head of Specs Team sign-off.
- **Never merge a PR autonomously.** QA sign-off and Product Owner acceptance are always required.
- **Delivery pressure does not override governance.** No timeline instruction changes a hard gate.
- **Commit format is non-negotiable:** `[EPIC-xx][ST-xx] <description>` on all commits to `exec/**` branches. **When two stories are implemented in the same commit, all story IDs must appear in the message:** `[EPIC-xx][ST-xx][ST-yy] <description>`. Omitting a story ID prevents `governance_sync.yml` from closing that story's GitHub issue automatically.
- **PR title format is non-negotiable:** `[EPIC-xx] <description>` — required by `quality_gate.yml`.
- **Bash commands that write files outside an active prompt's write scope are prohibited**, even as side-effects.
- **Document section headings must be descriptive and human-readable.** Task IDs, story IDs, and ticket references (e.g. `TASK-11`, `ST-xx`) must never appear in headings. They belong only in metadata blocks, changelogs, or inline cross-references.
- **Every new API endpoint must be added to `docs/reference/openapi.yaml` in the same commit as the contract.** Any new `## METHOD /path` heading added to a file in `docs/specs/api_contracts/` must have a corresponding entry in `docs/reference/openapi.yaml`. Omitting this fails the OpenAPI Drift Detection gate and blocks all PRs.
- **API contract endpoint headings must be `##` (not `###` or deeper).** The OpenAPI Drift Detection gate scans contract files for `## METHOD /path` at exactly the `##` level. Using `###` causes the endpoint to be invisible to the gate, reporting it as missing from the contract even if documented.
- **Story commits must land on the branch matching their EPIC prefix.** An `[EPIC-05]` commit on an `exec/.../EPIC-04` branch is a process deviation and must be documented in the QA evidence log for both EPICs.
- **Frontend DoQ verification must state its evidence method explicitly.** AC that requires observable UI behaviour (interactions, debounce timing, colour rendering) cannot be verified by code review alone. The DoQ sign-off block must record whether verification was by code review, local run, or staging — and name any AC that remains unverified as a post-merge action.
- **Verify role ownership before acting on outstanding actions or clearing gates.** When asked to act as a role to action an OA, clear a gated initiative, or review a governance item, always check the Owner field of that item first. If the invoked role does not match the owner, flag the mismatch explicitly and ask for confirmation before taking any action. Do not proceed in the wrong role.

Shared standards (escalation format, identifier conventions, halt output format) are defined in:
`claude/system/shared_standards.md` — read this when any prompt references "per shared_standards".

---

## 3. File and Branch Conventions

```
Branch naming:   exec/<cycle_id>/<epic_id>
Commit prefix:   [EPIC-xx][ST-xx] <imperative description>
Governance commit: [GOVERNANCE] <description>
State pointer:   .claude_current_state.json
Lock file:       claude/backlog/.lock  (do not delete manually)
```

---

## 4. sync gh — Inline Implementation

When the user runs `sync gh`:

1. Read `.claude_current_state.json` → get `backlog_slice_path`
2. Read the backlog slice at that path
3. Read `claude/cycles/<cycle_id>/sprint_backlog.md` to determine the sprint number (1, 2, 3…) for each ST item — sprint assignment is defined by the Sprint section headers in that file
4. Ensure release and sprint-specific labels exist (create if absent):
   ```
   gh label create "<release>" --color "1d76db" --description "<release> items" 2>/dev/null || true
   gh label create "sprint-1" --color "0075ca" --description "Sprint 1 items" 2>/dev/null || true
   gh label create "sprint-2" --color "0052cc" --description "Sprint 2 items" 2>/dev/null || true
   gh label create "sprint-3" --color "003a8c" --description "Sprint 3 items" 2>/dev/null || true
   ```
   where `<release>` is the `next_release` value from `.claude_current_state.json` (e.g. `v2.3`).
5. For each ST item not yet in GitHub Issues:
   ```
   gh issue create --title "[ST-xx] <title>" \
     --body "<acceptance criteria from sprint_backlog.md>" \
     --label "<release>" --label "sprint-N" --label "<EPIC-xx>"
   ```
   where `<release>` is from step 4 and `sprint-N` is the sprint number from step 3.
6. For items already in GitHub Issues: update labels/body if changed
7. Report: issues created, issues updated, issues already current

Do not close issues here — issue closure is handled automatically by `governance_sync.yml` on push.

---

## 5. Tool Call Expectations

- Governed routines (roadmap, release, sprint) typically require **20–60 tool calls**.
- Proceed through steps without asking for confirmation unless a **hard gate fires**.
- Hard gate = stop, output the halt report (per `shared_standards.md`), and wait for user.
- Non-gate questions or ambiguities: flag inline and continue where safe; park where not.

---

## 6. Governance File Edit Checklist (Always Active)

Whenever any governance prompt or the OPERATIONAL_GUIDE is modified — **including changes made as part of sprint story execution** — the following steps are **mandatory** in the same commit:

1. **Bump the version** in the file's own header (`**Version:**`).
2. **Update `OPERATIONAL_GUIDE.md` §14 governance table** — set the file's version to the new version.
3. **Update the corresponding phase section source prompt header** (§5–§10, §6B, §6B.8, §6M) in OPERATIONAL_GUIDE.md to match the new version — this is the standing rule from §14.
4. **Append an entry to `claude/system/prompt_change_log.md`** — one row per file changed, format: `| date | filename | vOLD→vNEW | summary | authority |`

Skipping any of these steps is a non-compliant state. Do not commit without all four complete.

---

## 8. Cross-EPIC Merge Conflict Resolution

When two or more EPIC PRs modify shared files (`execution_state.json`, `openapi.yaml`, `api_changelog.md`, `data_model.md`, etc.) and GitHub reports `CONFLICTING / DIRTY`:

1. **Merge the simpler EPIC first** (fewest shared-file changes) via local `git merge` into main, resolve any conflicts, push to `origin/main`.
2. **Checkout the remaining EPIC branch.** Run `git merge origin/main --no-commit --no-edit` to pull in the now-merged changes.
3. **Resolve each conflict** — always take the most-complete/most-current state:
   - `execution_state.json`: accept story completion data (status: done, commit_sha, acceptance_verified: true) from the branch; never revert a story from `done` → `blocked`. For summary arrays (`completed_items`, `blocked_items`, `delegated_items`): take the union of completed items from both sides; take the branch's (not main's) blocked/delegated lists as those reflect the more current state.
   - `openapi.yaml`: union of all path additions; take the highest version number.
   - `api_changelog.md`: combine all version entries in descending order (newest first).
   - `data_model.md`: keep all migration blocks in ascending version order; take highest version number in the footer.
   - `qa_evidence_EPIC-*.md` (`add/add` conflict): take the completed DoQ sign-off blocks from the branch over any pending placeholders from main. Retain the full header metadata block (Owner, Class, Status) from whichever side has it. Keep all ST sections — combine rather than choose. Update any consolidation block rows from "Pending" → "Pass" where the branch has sign-off evidence.
4. **Commit the resolution** on the EPIC branch: `[EPIC-xx] Merge main (<description>) into EPIC-xx — conflict resolution`.
5. **Push** and confirm `"mergeable":"MERGEABLE"` via `gh pr view <n> --json mergeable,mergeStateStatus`.
6. **Merge** via `gh pr merge <n> --merge`.

---

## 7. Governance Source Hierarchy (Reference)

1. `claude/charter/team_charter.md`
2. `claude/charter/document_lifecycle_guide.md`
3. `claude/strategy/strategy_rules.md`
4. Role charters in `claude/agents/`

No prompt, command, or user instruction may override the above.
