                        |
              AWS S3 (recordings) + SQS (async jobs)
```

**One app, three role-gated views:**
- **Rep routes** (`/dashboard/*`): Live call view, deal pipeline, personal metrics, post-call analytics
- **Manager routes** (`/manager/*`): Team monitoring, pipeline health, rep performance, call review
- **Admin routes** (`/admin/*`): Organization setup, CRM config, user management, AI settings
- Role-based access via middleware; shared component library

## LangGraph Agents (5) — Post-MVP

| Agent | Role | Model | Triggers |
|-------|------|-------|----------|
| Transcription Agent | Process Deepgram stream, chunk, diarize, store | Deepgram Nova-2 | Audio stream active |
| Objection Detection Agent | Classify transcript segments for objections | Haiku | Every 3-5 seconds of transcript |
| Coaching Agent | Generate contextual response suggestions | GPT-4o | Objection detected (confidence > 0.7) |
| Deal Scoring Agent | Compute deal probability from multi-signal features | Heuristic / XGBoost | After each objection event or every 60s |
| CRM Sync Agent | Bidirectional sync with Salesforce/HubSpot/Zoho | N/A (API calls) | Post-call trigger or scheduled batch |

**State:** `CallState(TypedDict)` — call_id, deal_id, rep_id, transcript_chunks, objections, suggestions, deal_score, deal_score_factors, talk_to_listen_ratio, call_duration, errors.

**Key Patterns:**
1. **Dual-LLM Cost Optimization** — Haiku for classification ($0.001/call), GPT-4o only for coaching reasoning ($0.01-$0.03/suggestion)
2. **Heuristic Before ML** — Ship heuristic scoring immediately; collect labeled data for XGBoost training
3. **Audit Every AI Decision** — Log model, tokens, cost, latency, decision, confidence in `ai_decision_logs`
4. **Cache Common Responses** — Redis cache for coaching suggestions keyed by objection_type + context_hash (TTL 1h)

## Design System — "Euron" (Strict)

All UI must follow this system. No deviations.

### Color Palette

| Token | Value | Usage |
|-------|-------|-------|
| `primary` | `#0A66C2` | Buttons, links, active states, brand accent |
| `primary-hover` | `#004182` | Hover/active on primary elements |
| `bg` | `#F3F6F8` | Page background |
| `surface` | `#FFFFFF` | Cards, panels, modals |
| `border` | `#E5E7EB` | Card borders, dividers, input borders |
| `text-primary` | `#111827` | Headings, body text |
| `text-muted` | `#6B7280` | Secondary text, captions, placeholders |
| `success` | `#057642` | Success states, positive score trends |
| `warning` | `#B45309` | Warning states, at-risk deals |
| `error` | `#B91C1C` | Error states, declining scores |
| `input-border` | `#D1D5DB` | Default input borders |

Blue is the dominant color. Success/warning/error used sparingly and functionally.

### Typography

- **Font:** Inter (import from Google Fonts)
- **Headings:** weight 600-700
- **Body:** weight 400-500

| Element | Size | Weight |
|---------|------|--------|
| Page title | 28-32px | 700 |
| Section header | 20-24px | 600 |
| Card title | 16-18px | 600 |
| Body text | 14-16px | 400 |
| Caption / meta | 12px | 400 |

Line height: 1.4-1.6 for all text.

### Cards

```css
background: #FFFFFF;
border: 1px solid #E5E7EB;
border-radius: 8px;
box-shadow: none; /* flat, stable, professional */
```

### Buttons

**Primary:** `bg: #0A66C2, color: #FFF, border-radius: 999px (pill), font-weight: 600`
**Secondary:** `bg: transparent, border: 1px solid #0A66C2, color: #0A66C2, pill`
**Tertiary:** Text only, muted gray.

### Forms & Inputs

- Height: 40-44px | Border: 1px solid #D1D5DB | Focus: border #0A66C2 + `ring-1 ring-blue-500/20`
- Labels above inputs | Placeholder in muted gray

### Icons & Motion

- Outline/stroke-based only (Lucide React or Heroicons outline)
- Hover transitions: 100-150ms ease | No bounce, no flashy animations

### Tailwind Config

```js
colors: {
  brand: { DEFAULT: '#0A66C2', hover: '#004182' },
  surface: '#FFFFFF',
  bg: '#F3F6F8',
  border: '#E5E7EB',
  'input-border': '#D1D5DB',
  'text-primary': '#111827',
  'text-muted': '#6B7280',
  success: '#057642',

---

## Key Flows (MVP)

### 1. Rep starts a live call with coaching
```
Rep selects deal -> Clicks "Start Call" -> POST /calls/{id}/start
-> WebSocket /ws/calls/{call_id}/live opens
-> Backend opens Deepgram stream -> Audio transcribed in real-time
-> Transcript chunks pushed to rep via WebSocket
-> Every 3-5s: objection detection (Haiku) on transcript window
-> If objection (confidence > 0.7): coaching suggestion generated (GPT-4o)
-> Suggestion pushed to rep via WebSocket (<2s latency)
-> Deal score updated and pushed via WebSocket
```

### 2. Post-call analytics
```
Rep ends call -> POST /calls/{id}/end
-> Deepgram stream closed -> Recording uploaded to S3
-> Post-call analytics job enqueued (SQS)
-> Worker: GPT-4o generates summary, key moments, action items
-> Report stored in DB -> Available in <30s
-> Deal score recalculated with final call data
```

### 3. Manager reviews pipeline
```
Manager opens Pipeline Analytics -> GET /analytics/dashboard
-> Visual pipeline: deals by stage, weighted revenue, risk flags
-> Clicks at-risk deal -> GET /deals/{id} + /deals/{id}/score
-> Reviews call history, objection patterns, score trend
-> Prepares coaching notes for 1:1
```

### 4. Deal scoring pipeline
```
Call event (objection, engagement signal) OR scheduled batch
-> Deal Scoring Service gathers feature vector
-> Heuristic: weighted signals (objections, engagement, recency, stage)
-> Score (0-100) + risk factors computed
-> Stored in deal_scores + deal.current_score updated
-> If below threshold: notification triggered
```

---

## Coding Conventions

### Backend (Python/FastAPI)
- **Architecture:** Routes > Services > Repositories (clean layered)
- Routes are thin — validation + dependency injection only
- Business logic in services, DB access through repositories
- Pydantic v2 for all request/response schemas
- Async I/O for all external calls (Deepgram, OpenAI, Supabase, Redis, S3)
- Error response: `{"code": "...", "message": "...", "details": ...}`
- Structured JSON logging with `request_id`, `call_id`, `deal_id`, `user_id`
- Never hardcode secrets

### Frontend (Next.js/TypeScript)
- App Router (Next.js 14+), TypeScript strict mode
- Small, reusable components; separate presentation from logic
- Handle loading, error, and empty states on every page
- WebSocket for live call data via `useWebSocket` hook
- Role-based routing middleware (rep, manager, admin)
- API calls through centralized `lib/api.ts`

### Security
- No secrets in code, Docker layers, or client bundles
- Validate all user input server-side
- RBAC enforced at API layer (middleware + route decorators)
- RLS enabled on all tenant-scoped tables
- Treat audio streams, transcripts, and prompts as untrusted
- PII masking on transcript storage

### Testing
- Tests for all service methods and auth flows
- Mock external services (Deepgram, OpenAI, Supabase, S3) in tests
- Cover validation, failure, and edge cases
- Integration tests for WebSocket call flow

## Development Workflow

1. **Start backend:** `cd backend && uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000`
2. **Start frontend:** `cd frontend && npm run dev`
3. **Start Redis:** `docker run -p 6379:6379 redis:alpine`
4. **Run migrations:** `supabase db push`
5. **Run tests:** `cd backend && pytest` / `cd frontend && npm test`
6. **Docker (full stack):** `docker-compose up`

## Prompt Persistence Rule

Every prompt must be saved to `prompts/prompt-history.md`:
- Format: ISO 8601 timestamp + exact prompt text
- Append only, never delete existing entries
- Never save secrets/tokens
