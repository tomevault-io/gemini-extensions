# AGENTS Guide: pi-anthropic-auth

This file contains shared context for agents working in this repository.
Keep it focused on information that multiple agents need: repository purpose, current architecture, constraints, commands, and known gotchas.
Do not turn this into a task log.

Project-level reusable workflows belong in `.agents/skills/`.
This repo currently includes skills for Anthropic OAuth debugging, Pi CLI repro loops, and Pi skill frontmatter conventions.

## Project

### Overview

`pi-anthropic-auth` is a small pnpm-based Pi package.
Its purpose is to minimally override Pi's built-in `anthropic` provider to improve Claude Pro/Max OAuth compatibility without breaking Pi's normal Anthropic API-key behavior.

The design intent is explicitly minimal.
Prefer wrapping or extending Pi's existing Anthropic behavior over replacing it wholesale.

### Primary Goal

Preserve all of Pi's normal Anthropic UX while adding only the compatibility layers Pi still appears to be missing for Claude Pro/Max OAuth.

That means preserving:

1. Built-in provider name: `anthropic`
2. Built-in model list
3. Normal Anthropic API-key behavior
4. Native `/login anthropic` UX

### Current Status

The current implementation does the following:

1. Re-registers the built-in `anthropic` provider with an `oauth` override only
2. Reuses Pi's native Anthropic login flow from `@mariozechner/pi-ai/oauth`
3. Hardens refresh behavior so missing rotated refresh tokens fall back to the previous refresh token
4. Uses `before_provider_request` to shape only built-in Anthropic OAuth payloads
5. Prepends an Anthropic billing/content-consistency header block to `system[]`
6. Replaces Pi's default system prompt preamble with a minimal neutral prompt (inside `before_provider_request`, gated by the same OAuth detection)

It does not currently replace Pi's built-in Anthropic streaming transport.

## Principles

### Keep The Override Thin

Prefer the smallest integration point that works.
If Pi already supports a behavior upstream, reuse it instead of copying it locally.

### Preserve Built-In Behavior By Default

API-key Anthropic behavior is the baseline.
Any OAuth-specific logic must be narrowly gated so it does not affect non-OAuth Anthropic requests.

### Prefer Request Shaping Before Prompt Rewriting

Start with refresh-token hardening, billing/header injection, and exact request-shape fixes.
Do not add broader prompt rewriting unless real failures show it is necessary.

### Isolate Compatibility Logic

Anthropic validation rules drift.
Keep compatibility logic in small helpers so it is easy to adjust without touching the rest of the extension.

## Architecture

### Extension Surface

The main extension entrypoint is `src/index.ts`.

It currently uses two Pi extension seams:

1. `pi.registerProvider("anthropic", { oauth })`
2. `pi.on("before_provider_request", ...)`

All provider-specific logic (billing header injection, message ordering, system prompt shaping) is consolidated in `before_provider_request`, gated by `isOAuthAnthropicPayload`.

Important upstream behavior confirmed from `pi-mono`:

1. Re-registering `anthropic` with only `oauth` overrides `/login anthropic` auth handling without replacing built-in models
2. Omitting `models` preserves Pi's built-in Anthropic model list
3. `before_provider_request` runs for built-in provider requests, after Pi builds the provider-specific payload

### Local Files

Current source layout:

1. `src/index.ts`: extension registration
2. `src/anthropic-oauth.ts`: OAuth override wrapper and refresh fallback
3. `src/request-shaping.ts`: OAuth-only request shaping helpers
4. `src/system-prompt-shaping.ts`: minimal Anthropic OAuth prompt replacement for Pi's default prompt
5. `src/debug.ts`: opt-in structured debug logging for live OAuth repros

### Project Skills

Project skills live in `.agents/skills/`.

Current skills:

1. `anthropic`: Anthropic OAuth compatibility lessons and debugging workflow
2. `pi-cli-repro`: repeatable `pi -p ... -e ...` repro workflow
3. `frontmatter`: Pi skill frontmatter template and rules

### Upstream Dependencies

This repo depends on:

1. `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent`
2. `@mariozechner/pi-ai`
3. `@anthropic-ai/sdk`

When possible, import Pi behavior from `@mariozechner/pi-ai/oauth` rather than copying code from upstream.

## Upstream Findings

These were confirmed by inspecting upstream `badlogic/pi-mono`.

### Pi Already Handles

Pi's built-in Anthropic provider already includes:

1. Claude Code OAuth headers
2. Claude Code identity injection in `system[]`
3. Claude Code tool-name mapping
4. Native Anthropic OAuth login support

Note: Pi upstream already normalizes Anthropic OAuth tool names to Claude Code canonical casing. Do not add OpenCode-style `mcp_` tool prefix rewriting here unless a concrete Pi-specific transport failure proves the built-in normalization is insufficient.

### Gap Identified So Far

The clearest upstream gap found during initial inspection is refresh-token rotation robustness.
Pi's built-in Anthropic refresh helper currently expects a fresh `refresh_token` on refresh responses.
Other Pi OAuth providers already fall back to the previous refresh token when a new one is omitted.

## Development

### Package Manager

Use `pnpm`.

### Git Workflow

Before starting work, sync the branch with the remote using:

```bash
git pull --ff-only
```

Do this only with a clean working tree. If local changes already exist, commit or stash them first.

Make small Conventional Commit checkpoints during the work, not only at the end.
Prefer committing after each meaningful, validated milestone (for example: a bug fix, a test update, a docs pass, or a repro/debugging aid) so progress is recoverable and easy to review.

At the end of the work:

1. ensure all intended work is committed locally
2. push the branch
3. watch CI on `main`
4. wait for release-please to catch up if needed
5. only then merge the open release-please PR after its CI is green
6. run `git pull --ff-only` locally to pick up the release commit

Preferred release step (pass the release-please PR number explicitly):

```bash
gh pr merge --rebase <pr-number>
```

Do not merge a release-please PR while local commits are still unpushed or while the PR was generated from an older `main` than the commits you just finished.

### Commands

Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Run the typecheck:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

Alias:

```bash
pnpm run check
```

### TypeScript

This repo uses `module` and `moduleResolution` set to `NodeNext`.
Use `.js` import specifiers for local TypeScript module imports.

### Commit Messages

All commit messages must follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).

Format: `<type>[optional scope]: <description>`

Common types used in this repo:

- `feat`: new behavior or capability
- `fix`: bug fix or compatibility correction
- `docs`: documentation-only changes
- `chore`: maintenance, dependency updates, tooling
- `refactor`: restructuring without behavior change
- `test`: adding or updating tests

Examples:

```text
feat: add refresh-token fallback for rotated OAuth tokens
fix: always inject required OAuth betas regardless of upstream header
docs: add ask_user tool usage guidelines to AGENTS.md
chore: bump pi-ai peer dependency to 0.69.0
```

### Editing Conventions

1. Prefer ASCII unless the file already requires otherwise
2. Keep helper modules small and purpose-specific
3. Avoid introducing a custom full Anthropic transport unless hook limitations force it

## `ask_user` Tool Usage

This project has `pi-ask-user` installed as a local Pi plugin.
The `ask_user` tool renders as a compact dialog widget — not a document viewer.
Keep invocations lean and put supporting context in regular message output.

### When to use it

Load the `ask-user` skill and invoke `ask_user` before:

1. High-stakes architectural decisions (provider override strategy, seam changes, transport replacement).
2. Irreversible or costly-to-undo changes (large refactors, breaking API-key behavior).
3. Ambiguous requirements or conflicting constraints.
4. Any step where multiple valid options exist and the trade-off is preference-dependent.

A quick clarifying question is cheaper than 10 tool calls of inconclusive investigation.

### Manual actions

When a task requires a manual action from the user (e.g., run a `pi` command, log in via a browser flow, approve an OAuth prompt), use `ask_user` to gate on completion rather than printing instructions and continuing.

Use options like: `Done`, `Need help`, `Something went wrong`.

If the user selects `Need help` or `Something went wrong`, ask clarifying questions before retrying.

### Context before, not inside

Output all explanatory context — plan summaries, analysis results, trade-off notes — as regular message text **before** invoking `ask_user`.
The `question` parameter should be a concise prompt, almost never more than one sentence.
Options should be short and outcome-oriented.

### One decision per call

Each `ask_user` call should address a single independent decision.
Do not combine unrelated decisions into one call with combinatorial options.
For multiple independent decisions, make sequential calls — one per decision.

## Testing Guidance

Tests live in `test/` and run via `vitest`.

### Commands

Run the full suite:

```bash
pnpm test
```

Watch mode:

```bash
pnpm run test:watch
```

Live Pi repro (prefer the latest Haiku alias for fast feedback unless the bug appears model-specific):

```bash
pi \
  --model anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5 \
  --no-session \
  --tools read,grep,find,ls \
  -e /Users/chris/development/pi/pi-anthropic-auth/src/index.ts \
  -p "How many lines are in @AGENTS.md ?"
```

Debug modes for live repros:

```bash
PI_ANTHROPIC_AUTH_DEBUG=all
PI_ANTHROPIC_AUTH_DEBUG=tool-use
```

Use `tool-use` by default when debugging real CLI flows so logs stay quiet until Anthropic tool calls are actually involved.

### Conventions

1. Test files are named `*.test.ts` and are collocated under `test/` (not next to source).
2. Tests use `node:assert/strict` for assertions and `vitest`'s `test` (and `onTestFinished` for per-test cleanup) for the runner.  Existing files are the reference style — keep new tests consistent.
3. Keep tests focused on compatibility helpers rather than broad end-to-end behavior.  Mock `globalThis.fetch` for OAuth flows; build payload fixtures inline rather than depending on Pi internals.
4. When asserting on shaped system prompts, prefer regex matches that pin specific markers (`/^You are an expert coding assistant\./`, `/# Project Context/`) over deep-equal on full prompt strings, so tests survive harmless reformatting upstream.

### Coverage areas

Current suites map roughly to:

1. `test/anthropic-oauth.test.ts` — OAuth callback parsing, manual-code edge cases, and refresh-token rotation fallback.
2. `test/request-shaping.test.ts` — OAuth-only payload guarding, billing header injection, system block layering, and beta-header merging.
3. `test/system-prompt-shaping.test.ts` — preamble replacement, appended-content preservation, and degraded-mode fallbacks.
4. `test/pi-anthropic-ordering-experiment.test.ts` — pinned experiments documenting Pi's tool-use serialization behavior.

Priority areas for new tests:

1. OAuth callback parsing
2. Refresh fallback when `refresh_token` is omitted
3. Billing header generation
4. OAuth-only request-body shaping
5. System prompt shaping boundaries (preamble anchors, appended content preservation, fallback paths)

## Gotchas

### Provider Hook Scope

`before_provider_request` only exposes the built payload, not the provider name.
Request-shaping logic therefore needs a reliable Anthropic OAuth guard based on payload structure, not provider metadata from the hook event.

### `model_select` Does Not Fire At Startup

Pi's `model_select` event only fires from `setModel` and `cycleModel`.
The initial model assigned during `createAgentSession` goes directly to `agent.state.model` without emitting the event.
Do not rely on `model_select` to track the provider for logic that must run on the first turn.

### `before_agent_start` Has No Provider Context

The `BeforeAgentStartEvent` does not expose which provider or model is active.
Provider-specific logic cannot be reliably gated in `before_agent_start`.
Use `before_provider_request` instead, where the payload structure identifies the provider.

### Avoid Over-Porting From OpenCode

This repository is not trying to reproduce `opencode-anthropic-auth` wholesale.
OpenCode needed broader system prompt debranding.
Pi's built-in Anthropic provider is already much closer to the desired Claude Code request shape.

### Registering `streamSimple`

If you register a custom `streamSimple`, you are much closer to replacing Pi's built-in Anthropic transport.
Do that only if hooks are insufficient for the concrete compatibility issue being fixed.

### Model ID Alias Drift

Pi CLI model aliases and the locally installed `@mariozechner/pi-ai` package do not always accept the exact same Anthropic Haiku spelling.
In this repo, prefer the dashed form `anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5` in docs and repro commands, and `claude-haiku-4-5` in tests that call `getModel("anthropic", ...)` directly.
