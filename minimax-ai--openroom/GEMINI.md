# VibeApp Development Guide

An iframe-based micro-frontend VibeApp system (React + Cloud NAS).

## Quick Start

Create a new app: `/vibe {AppName} {Description}`
Modify an existing app: `/vibe {AppName} {ChangeDescription}`
Resume an existing workflow: `/vibe {AppName}`
Re-run from a specific stage: `/vibe {AppName} --from=04-codegen`

Creation mode runs 6 stages: Requirement Analysis -> Architecture Design -> Task Planning -> Code Generation -> Asset Generation -> Project Integration.
Change mode runs 4 stages: Change Impact Analysis -> Change Task Planning -> Change Code Implementation -> Change Verification.
You can also enter a requirement description directly, and the system will automatically detect and trigger the corresponding mode.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (H5 Pages), CSS Modules (Components)
- **Icons**: Lucide React (No Emoji)
- **Storage**: Cloud NAS via `@/lib` (Repository Pattern)
- **Communication**: `postMessage` via `@/lib`

## Rules

The following global rules in `.claude/rules/` are mandatory constraints across all stages:

| Rule File | Description |
|---|---|
| `data-interaction.md` | Data interaction & NAS storage specification |
| `design-tokens.md` | Design token system & usage guidelines |
| `concurrent-execution.md` | Concurrent execution & task scheduling rules |
| `post-task-check.md` | Post-task completion checklist |

Stage-specific rules are in `.claude/workflow/rules/`, loaded on-demand by `/vibe`.

## Auto Workflow Trigger

When the user enters a requirement description directly (instead of using the `/vibe` command), automatically execute the workflow defined in `.claude/commands/vibe.md`.

### Creating a New App

Detection rules:

- The user's message contains an explicit new app requirement (e.g., "build a XX app", "I need a XX", "help me develop XX")
- Automatically extract AppName (PascalCase format) from the requirement; Description is the user's full requirement text
- Equivalent to executing `/vibe {AppName} {Description}`

### Modifying an Existing App

Detection rules:

- The user's message explicitly targets an existing App with a change request (e.g., "add lyrics feature to MusicApp", "MusicApp needs to support XX")
- Also includes cases where the App name is not specified but can be inferred from context (e.g., there is only one App, and the user says "add a lyrics display feature")
- Automatically identify AppName; Description is the change requirement text
- Equivalent to executing `/vibe {AppName} {ChangeDescription}` (vibe.md's mode detection logic automatically enters change mode)

### Cases That Do NOT Trigger

- The user is clearly asking questions, chatting, or making fine-grained code modifications (e.g., "change this button color to red")
- The user used the `/vibe` command (already handled by the command mechanism)
- The user requests resuming or re-running from a specific stage (must explicitly use `/vibe {AppName}` or `/vibe {AppName} --from=XX`)

## Testing

### Unit Tests (Vitest)

Run from the webuiapps package:

```bash
cd apps/webuiapps && pnpm test        # single run
cd apps/webuiapps && pnpm test:watch  # watch mode
```

### E2E Tests (Playwright)

Run from the repo root. The dev server starts automatically.

```bash
pnpm test:e2e          # headless, Chromium only
pnpm test:e2e:ui       # interactive UI mode
```

- Config: `playwright.config.ts` (root)
- Tests: `e2e/` directory
- The web server (`pnpm dev`) is auto-launched on port 3000 and reused if already running.
- Only Chromium is configured by default; add projects in `playwright.config.ts` for Firefox/WebKit.
- After completing code changes that affect UI or routing, run `pnpm test:e2e` and report pass/fail.

## Task completion quality bar (mandatory)

Before declaring a task complete, agents must satisfy all of the following:

1. **Unit tests must pass** for the affected package(s).
   - For `apps/webuiapps`, run the relevant Vitest command(s), for example:
     ```bash
     cd apps/webuiapps && pnpm test
     cd apps/webuiapps && pnpm test:coverage
     ```
2. **Code coverage must be > 90%** for the code touched by the task.
   - If current config thresholds are lower, do not treat that as sufficient.
   - Add or improve tests until the changed area exceeds 90% coverage, or explicitly report why that is not yet achievable.
3. **E2E coverage must be complete for impacted user flows.**
   - Do not stop at smoke tests if the change affects real behavior.
   - Cover the primary user path, key state transitions, and at least one meaningful assertion of successful behavior.
   - If UI behavior changes, prefer stable selectors (`data-testid`) over fragile class-name/text-only selectors.
4. **Report exact validation commands and results** in the final handoff.
   - Include what passed, what failed, and any known gaps.

Minimum expectation: no task is "done" if unit tests are red, coverage on changed code is below 90%, or impacted E2E coverage is missing/incomplete.
