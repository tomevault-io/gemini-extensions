# memhub — Codex CLI instructions

Local-first Rust CLI for durable per-repo project memory shared between Codex, Claude Code, and OpenCode. Treat [docs/reference/memhub-prd.md](docs/reference/memhub-prd.md) as the product authority and do not silently diverge from it.

This file is the Codex/OpenCode counterpart to `CLAUDE.md`. The two exist so Codex CLI, OpenCode CLI, and Claude Code sessions get the same orientation when they open this repo. Where they diverge it is intentional (different agent identifiers, different skill paths).

## Session Continuity

This repo is **memhub-primary** as of M7-002 (2026-05-13). The DB at `.memhub/project.sqlite` is the source of truth; rendered markdown is a local human-readable view under `.memhub/rendered/`. At session start, read `.memhub/rendered/PROJECT.md` if present for the "currently building / next up / open questions" state, the architecture narrative, and recent session notes; if it is missing, fall back to `memhub recall` / `memhub status`.

The mid-session routing rules — prefer recall over the `PROJECT_LEDGER.md` ledger, the turn-1-only PROJECT.md read, and re-render after changes — live in the memhub MCP server's own instructions (`src/mcp/mod.rs`) and are not duplicated here.

If recall returns a `warnings[].kind == "stale_embeddings"` entry, surface it and ask the user before invoking `/reindex`. Recall results stay usable in the meantime — the warning means hybrid scoring may be undercounting some rows, not that retrieval is broken.

The four legacy K9 files (`agent_docs/project_state.md`, `project_arch.md`, `project_decisions.md`, `project_backlog.md`) are historical archive — last accurate at commit `366cc1c`. Do not write to them; they are no longer authoritative. K9 integration is disabled in `.memhub/config.toml`.

## Cross-machine workflow

memhub state is **per-machine**. Each machine has its own `.memhub/project.sqlite`, its own embeddings, and its own rendered markdown under `.memhub/rendered/`. None of that is committed to git — only code, migrations, and the static tracked `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` guardrails are.

**After `git pull` on a fresh or existing machine:**

```bash
cargo build --release
cargo run --release -- status   # first call auto-applies pending migrations from migrations/*.sql
```

`db::open_project` runs `migrations::apply_all` on every invocation; migrations are idempotent against `schema_migrations`, so no manual step is needed even if the schema bumped on another machine.

**To carry memory between machines (e.g. continue on Windows what you started on Mac):**

```bash
# on the source machine
memhub export ~/transfer/memhub-<repo>-<date>.json

# move the file via Drive / USB / scp — memhub itself stays offline

# on the target machine, with an existing memhub project
memhub import ~/transfer/memhub-<repo>-<date>.json          # refuses if target has data
memhub import ~/transfer/memhub-<repo>-<date>.json --force  # overwrite

# or to bootstrap a target that has no DB yet
memhub init --from-backup ~/transfer/memhub-<repo>-<date>.json
```

After import, the target's embeddings are not yet built (only the rows). Run `memhub index` to populate them — the import output prints this hint. Until then, recall falls back to FTS-only and may miss vector-similar matches.

If recall later surfaces a `stale_embeddings` warning (most likely after an embedding-model upgrade on either machine), follow the same rule as everywhere else: surface it and ask before invoking `/reindex`.

The export format is JSON v1, additive: older exports import cleanly into newer builds via `#[serde(default)]` on later-added fields. The format is defined in `src/export/v1.rs`.

**Config baseline travels with the repo.** The canonical defaults live in `.memhub/config.example.toml`, which is the **only** file inside `.memhub/` that is tracked by git. A fresh `memhub init` (or the first `open_project` call on a machine with no local config) copies the example verbatim into `.memhub/config.toml`. The local file stays gitignored and per-machine; edit the example to change the baseline for every machine. Fields that should not drift (deny_list, retrieval weights, render output dir, integrations) are documented at the top of the example as commit-back-here fields.

## Cross-machine Drive sync

Milestone 10 (design anchor: [docs/reference/memhub-prd-addendum-m10-drive-sync.md](docs/reference/memhub-prd-addendum-m10-drive-sync.md)) makes one user's repo memory follow them between their own machines through a synced folder, **without memhub ever going online**. It is the export/import flow above, automated and made fast-forward-aware.

**Model (decisions 102/103/104).** Whole-DB **snapshot**, not row merge: each push writes a consistent single-file DB copy (`VACUUM INTO`) plus a `manifest.json`. Divergence is decided from a **logical version** (a digest of the durable content tables, never file bytes — SQLite is byte-unstable), so `check` reports a git-style verdict: `up-to-date` / `local-ahead` / `drive-ahead` / `diverged` / `no-remote`. The single lossy case (both sides changed) is **operator-gated**, never automatic. Scope is deliberately **single-user across their own machines**: last-writer-wins on a diverged history is an accepted cost; no snapshot-history/undo buffer, no multi-user plumbing — do not re-propose either (decision 103).

**Transport is an OS-level synced folder, NOT the Drive MCP connector (decision 104).** memhub stays fully offline and only reads/writes a local path. Google Drive for Desktop (macOS/Windows) or an rclone mount (Linux) does the byte movement out of band — so writing a snapshot *into* the synced folder *is* the push. (The base64-over-MCP courier framing in the addendum is superseded: a 2.8 MB snapshot is ~987K tokens per transfer.)

**Canonical remote path** is resolved in code (`sync::resolve_remote_dir`), no longer hand-concatenated: `<drive_subpath>/memhub/<project_id>`, where `drive_subpath` is the absolute synced-folder mount in `[sync]` and `project_id` derives from the git remote (or an explicit `[sync] project_id` override for a no-remote repo). CLI sync commands default to it when the path arg is omitted.

**Per-repo opt-in** (mirrors `memhub global enable`): `memhub sync enable`. `enabled` + `drive_subpath` live in `.memhub/config.toml` `[sync]`; the tracked `.memhub/config.example.toml` baseline ships `enabled = false`. When disabled, every sync command refuses.

Surfaces:
- CLI: `memhub sync enable|disable|status|snapshot|check|adopt|commit`. A push is `snapshot` then `commit`; a pull is `check` then `adopt --yes`. `status` shows the resolved `remote dir`.
- MCP (the agent-first surface): `memhub.sync_status`, `memhub.sync_snapshot`, `memhub.sync_check`, `memhub.sync_commit`, and `memhub.sync_adopt`. All default the target to the canonical path; pass `remote` to override. **`sync_adopt` is gated**: it overwrites the local DB (the one destructive op), so without `confirm=true` it returns the would-change verdict and refuses — surface that to the user and only re-call with `confirm=true` after they approve. Hard refusals regardless of confirm: project-id mismatch, a snapshot schema newer than this binary (run `memhub upgrade`), or a checksum that disagrees with the manifest.
- Skill: `/catch-up` orchestrates the pull side (check → summarize → adopt with your approval).

`known_projects`/registry membership and the M9 global store are **unrelated** to sync. Sync state (`[sync]`, the `sync_marker.json` baseline) is per-machine and **not** exported by `memhub export`.

## Agent attribution (Codex-specific)

When you write to memhub from the CLI, identify yourself so the row gets attributed correctly. Two flags matter:

- `--source` — origin of the claim. Pass `--source user+agent:codex` on `memhub fact add` / `memhub decision add` writes that go through `/wrap-up` (agent surfaced, user approved). For direct CLI writes the user typed themselves, omit the flag and take the `user` default.
- `--actor` — who performed the write. Pass `--actor codex:wrap-up` from the wrap-up skill; `--actor codex:<skill-name>` from other skills.

See [docs/reference/memhub-prd-source-vocabulary-addendum.md](docs/reference/memhub-prd-source-vocabulary-addendum.md) for the full vocabulary (`user`, `agent:<id>`, `user+agent:<id>`, `git`, `observed`).

When you write via MCP (`memhub serve` registered in `~/.codex/config.toml`), attribution is automatic — the server reads `clientInfo.name` from `initialize` and tags writes as `codex` / `codex:wrap-up` without you needing to pass anything.

## Project Guardrails

- Local-first, offline-capable, and intentionally boring.
- Milestone 1 stays lean: CLI, DB, migrations, config, logging, and real CRUD for facts, decisions, and tasks.
- Agents are untrusted writers; do not promote agent claims to durable truth without a concrete signal or explicit user action.
- Prefer narrow milestones and explicit TODOs over speculative subsystems.
- Do not pretend MCP, markdown sync, git ingestion, routing, or confidence decay are implemented before they exist.
- Keep `docs/reference/memhub-prd.md` verbatim. PRD changes land as addendum files in `docs/reference/`.

## Delegation (this repo)

Scoped exception to the global subagent policy, for memhub only: once an
implementation plan is approved, the main session MAY delegate implementation
work to subagents without re-asking for each spawn. This license is limited to
executing the approved plan — it is not open season.

- **Default to a cheaper execution-tier model.** Delegate implementation and
  test runs/diagnosis to a fast subagent; reserve the main session for
  orchestration.
- **Escalate a subtask to a stronger model** only when it needs cross-file
  architectural reasoning, subtle concurrency/correctness work, or it already
  failed once on the cheaper tier. Otherwise stay on the cheaper tier.
- **Main thread keeps** architecture/design decisions and anything outside the
  approved plan. Subagents execute; they don't decide scope.
- Outside an approved plan, ask before spawning for multi-file/architectural
  work. (Claude Code's specific agent names and model tiers — `implementer`,
  `cargo-test-runner`, Opus/Sonnet — live in `CLAUDE.md`.)

## Retrieval

Hybrid recall (the default) combines FTS5 BM25 and BGE-small embeddings,
then by default runs a bundled cross-encoder re-ranker
(ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2) over the top `[retrieval] rerank_candidate_pool`
candidates before truncating to `max_results`. The re-ranker adds
~275 ms per recall at pool=20 in exchange for ~+17 percentage points of
Recall@1 on memhub's own golden set (decision 68).

Toggle per-call with `memhub recall <query> --no-rerank`, or globally
with `[retrieval] use_reranker = false` in `.memhub/config.toml`. The
re-ranker is bundled into the binary unconditionally (no Cargo feature
flag) — turning it off in config skips the inference cost but doesn't
strip the model from disk. FTS-only mode bypasses the re-ranker
entirely.

Candidates whose cross-encoder logit falls below
`[retrieval.scoring] min_rerank_score` (default 2.0) are dropped
after re-ranking, primarily to keep gibberish queries returning empty
bundles. This replaces the legacy `min_vector_score` cosine floor
(decisions 70, 71). Override per-call with `--min-rerank-score=<F>`
(use the `=` form for negative values).

Decisions support an optional `summary` field (migration 0011,
decision 72). When set, the summary is prepended to both the embed
text and the cross-encoder rerank input, so jargon-titled decisions
surface for plain-English queries. Set with `memhub decision add
--summary "..."` or backfill with `memhub decision set-summary <ID>
"..."`. Decision 72 covers the empirical lift this produced.

For A/B testing in any repo: `memhub eval retrieval` vs
`memhub eval retrieval --no-rerank`.

## Token Accounting

Off by default. Opt in per machine with `memhub metrics enable` — this
auto-detects the Claude Code transcript directory and writes the resolved
path into `.memhub/config.toml`. Disable with `memhub metrics disable`.

Two independent sub-switches under `[metrics]`:
- `recall_proxy = true` (component A) — logs one row to `recall_metrics`
  per `memhub recall` call: actual bundle size vs a full-ledger
  counterfactual, tokenised with tiktoken cl100k.
- `session_accounting = true` (component B) — scrapes Claude Code
  transcript JSONL into `session_metrics` for real input/output/cache
  token totals. Scraping is incremental and never fatal; bad lines are
  skipped.

**Codex note:** component B currently scrapes Claude Code transcripts
only. `codex_transcripts_dir` in `[metrics]` is a stub until the Codex
transcript format is confirmed; until then a Codex session contributes
component-A proxy rows (every `memhub recall` is logged regardless of
host) but no real input/output token totals.

**Proxy contract:** `bundle_tokens` is the token count of the recall bundle
actually returned. `ledger_tokens` (per row in `recall_metrics`) is the size
of `PROJECT_LEDGER.md` at recall time, measured in cl100k tokens. The
counterfactual is **session-scoped**: for each session that had at least one
non-empty recall, charge one ledger load (the minimum `ledger_tokens` across
that session's recalls, as a proxy for session-start size) and subtract all
non-empty bundle tokens. Empty-bundle recalls (no results returned) are not
savings events and contribute nothing to the offset. The rendered label is
"context offset vs full-ledger baseline" — not "tokens saved" — because the
agent would not necessarily have loaded the full ledger anyway.

**Empirical counterfactual baseline (task 64, decision 109).** The assumed
full-ledger baseline above is a guess. Task 64 adds a *measured* baseline
alongside it: `session_metrics.baseline_input_tokens` (migration 0017) records
the **full prompt of each session's first usage turn** — `input_tokens +
cache_read_input_tokens + cache_creation_input_tokens` — which approximates
everything loaded at session start (system prompt + CLAUDE.md + PROJECT.md +
any handoff md). It is `input + both cache fields`, **not `input_tokens`
alone**, because under prompt caching the bulk of startup context is billed as
cache_creation/cache_read; `input_tokens` alone undercounts startup ~10×. The
scraper sets it once per session, on the first usage line (`COALESCE` keeps the
earliest), so it pins the session-START cost. In `render_period_block` the
headline "Context offset" now prefers the **median `baseline_input_tokens`
across the window's no-recall sessions** (`recall_calls = 0`) as the
denominator (`recall_sessions × that median`), with the assumed full-ledger
percentage shown on an aligned line beneath so the gap is visible. The column
is **machine-local, not exported, and not applied retroactively** — existing
sessions are already past their first-turn offset, so the empirical baseline
accrues from new sessions forward (an uncalibrated/empty install renders only
the assumed line, byte-identical to before). The dashboard burn-up chart
(`query_series`) still uses the assumed ledger counterfactual; only the period
block changed.

**Tokenizer caveat:** tiktoken cl100k is ±10% off Anthropic's real
tokenizer. Ratios stay sound because both sides of every comparison use the
same yardstick; treat absolute token counts as estimates, not ground truth.

**Tokenizer calibration (task 63, decision 109).** The ±10% above is a
fixed multiplier, so it can be corrected once. `memhub metrics calibrate`
sends a **fixed bundled corpus** — never your project's content — to
Anthropic's `count_tokens` endpoint, measures the cl100k→real ratio, and
writes it back to `[metrics] calibration_factor`. `tokenizer::tokens_of`
then scales every estimate by it (default `1.0` = uncalibrated
passthrough). It corrects *absolute* counts and the ledger-vs-bundle
*offset*; the context-offset **percentage** is a ratio of equally-scaled
numbers and is unchanged. **This is the only command in all of memhub
that touches the network** (via `ureq`, compiled in but never reached
otherwise) — offline-first holds because the call is explicit and
one-time. It is **CLI-only ops housekeeping like `gc`/`upgrade`,
deliberately not an MCP/agent surface**. The factor is **per-machine**
and **not applied retroactively**. Needs `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in the
environment; refuses cleanly without it.

**Cache churn (task 62).** Each rendered period block also carries a
`Cache churn:` line — the share of cache tokens that were *creation*
(rebuilt prefix) rather than *read* (reused prefix), the honest "we kept
rebuilding the cache" signal at a 1M-token window. Two figures: the
token-weighted window churn and an equal-weighted per-session mean, both
from the already-logged `cache_read_tokens` / `cache_creation_tokens` (no
migration). Omitted when a window had no cache activity. Rendered only in
`render_period_block` surfaces; the plain `memhub metrics status` CLI
text keeps its leaner layout.

Dashboard surfaces: `memhub metrics status` (CLI) · `memhub.metrics` (MCP
tool) · `/metrics` (skill). `memhub render` appends a 7-day digest to
`PROJECT.md` when enabled and ≥1 row exists; the section is omitted
entirely when disabled or when no data has been captured yet.

## Doc Ingestion

External markdown reference docs (design specs, API contracts) can be
ingested into `.memhub/project.sqlite` as opt-in retrieval material
(decision 86). The file is chunked by heading — fenced code blocks kept
intact — and each chunk is embedded, so it is retrievable through the
same SQL+RAG hybrid recall as facts, decisions, and tasks.

**Default after first ingest (decision 90, extends 86).** Docs are
opt-in by default; the first successful `memhub doc add` in a repo
flips `[retrieval] include_docs_in_default` on in that repo's local
config, so the user-pointed write that establishes docs also wires up
retrieval. After that, plain `memhub recall` surfaces a doc chunk only
when it clears the cross-encoder relevance boundary
(`[retrieval.scoring] doc_min_rerank_score`, default 0.0) — strong
topical matches in, off-topic docs out, so a UI style guide stays
silent on a backend query while a code style guide surfaces. The
doc floor is deliberately *below* `min_rerank_score`: doc chunks
rerank in a lower band than facts/decisions (an on-topic doc ≈ +1.6,
off-topic ≈ −11), so a higher floor would filter relevant docs.
Scope to docs alone with `memhub recall <query> --source-type doc`
(CLI) or `memhub.recall(query=..., source_types=["doc"])` (MCP);
explicit scoping keeps the normal floor and is unaffected by the
flag. Plain recall still returns `available_docs` — now the count of
ingested chunks that did *not* surface this call — so a doc-scoped
follow-up for the long tail stays a judgment call. Set
`include_docs_in_default = false` to revert to strict opt-in.

Surfaces: `memhub doc add|ls|show|rm` (CLI) · `memhub.doc_add` (MCP,
direct write — a doc is a user-pointed artifact, not an agent claim) ·
`/doc` (skill). Re-ingesting an unchanged file is a no-op; changed
content replaces every chunk and refreshes embeddings/FTS.

Doc content is **excluded from `memhub export`** — it is a disk-backed,
re-ingestable cache. On another machine, re-run `doc add` against the
same file. Embeddings populate only in `hybrid` mode; `fts` mode
ingests chunks + FTS and vector recall for docs starts after
`memhub index rebuild`.

## Code Index

Milestone 11 (design anchor:
[docs/reference/memhub-prd-addendum-m11-code-locator.md](docs/reference/memhub-prd-addendum-m11-code-locator.md))
adds a **code locator**: a cheap semantic file/symbol search over the
repo's own source, separate from project memory. `memhub locate <query>`
returns ranked `path:line-range` breadcrumbs plus a clipped snippet; the
agent then `Read`s that exact span. It never returns code into a recall
bundle and never edits.

**Isolated by construction (decision 107).** The index is a sibling DB at
`.memhub/code_index.sqlite` — gitignored, per-machine, and **never read by
`memhub recall`, never in `memhub export`, never in M10 sync**. That
physical separation is what preserves the recall eval-regression guarantee
(mirrors M9's registry-is-not-recall rule). It is also **derivable +
disposable**: no migration framework, just `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` +
a `schema_version` in `index_meta`; a version mismatch drops and rebuilds,
so `memhub upgrade` is a no-op for it. The index set is `git ls-files`
filtered through the existing deny-list and scoped to grammar-known source
languages (task 69, below).

**Symbol-aware chunking (decisions 108, 115–120).** A tree-sitter AST
chunker emits one chunk per top-level item and one `Type::method` chunk per
method, with header-only chunks for container types. For Rust it also
emits one file-level `module-doc` chunk capturing the leading `//!` doc
comment, so a file whose purpose lives in its module prose stays
retrievable (a `ModuleDoc` grammar hook — task 85 added Rust inner-doc
capture; task 87 extended it to all six languages: Python docstring, Go
package doc, TS/JS file JSDoc, C#/Java file doc comment). Six languages get
real AST chunking — **Rust, Go, Python, TypeScript/JavaScript, Java, C#**
— via a hybrid `GrammarSpec` + typed hooks whose defaults reproduce Rust
byte-for-byte; a frozen snapshot test guards Rust output (the Rust freeze
is unchanged by task 87). Task 88 added a hermetic polyglot eval —
`tests/locate_polyglot.rs` writes a six-language fixture repo and runs
`eval::run_locate` over `tests/code_locate_golden_polyglot.json` — so
non-Rust module-doc capture is held to the same Recall@K contract as Rust
(100% Recall@3), not just the chunker unit tests.
Grammars are bundled unconditionally and ABI-pinned with a per-language
load canary; detection is extension-only. A grammar-known file that fails
to parse falls back to line-window chunking; files of any other type are
excluded from the index entirely (task 69, below) rather than line-windowed.

**Lazy git-aware freshness (decision 109).** Every `locate` first diffs
`(mtime, size)` per tracked file against the index, confirms changes with a
content hash, re-chunks only what moved, and drops deleted/renamed files —
so results always reflect the working tree. A warm index is near-free
(stat-only); the first-ever index is the one expensive pass (~171s cold vs
~1.4s warm on memhub's tree), so `memhub code index` is the explicit
warm-up. `locate` is therefore a read-then-write op, but writes nothing to
`project.sqlite`.

**Retrieval default: fusion, reranker OFF (decisions 114, 122, 123).**
Recall is FTS BM25 + vector fusion with the cross-encoder reranker off and
no score floor. On `tests/code_locate_golden.json` fusion now scores
**100% Recall@3** (18/18; Recall@1 61.1%) and the reranker holds at 88.9%
Recall@3 / 77.8% Recall@1. Task 85 (decision 123) lifted fusion past the
reranker on the governing metric by closing the last two misses at their
source: a 0.90 test-path down-weight so `tests/` / `benches/` / `examples/`
chunks stop out-ranking implementation, and capturing the Rust file-level
`//!` module doc as a chunk so a file described by its module prose is
retrievable. This supersedes decision 122's fusion≈rerank tie — fusion now
wins Recall@3 outright and runs ~12× faster, so it stays decisively the
default. `--rerank` remains the opt-in and still wins single-best-guess
Recall@1 (77.8% vs 61.1%). No nonsense floor is free: a `--min-rerank-score`
of 0 rejects both gibberish probes but also kills a true match (lowest
true-match logit −5.44), so the 2 nonsense-probe leaks under fusion are an
accepted no-floor cost. `memhub eval locate [--rerank]` is the A/B harness;
it indexes memhub's own (Rust) tree, so the non-Rust grammars are A/B'd by
the polyglot fixture eval in `tests/locate_polyglot.rs` (task 88) instead.

Surfaces: `memhub locate` / `memhub code index|status|rm` (CLI) ·
`memhub.locate` (MCP, read-only — clipped snippets only, never full code) ·
`/locate` (skill).

**Source-scoped index (task 69).** The index is scoped to grammar-known
source files only — the deny-list still applies on top, and vendored/
minified `*.min.*` bundles are excluded (a real `.js` extension that is not
hand-written code). The grammar registry is the single source of truth for
"indexable source", so a new language row is auto-included; non-source
files (docs, `Cargo.lock`, JSON/YAML/TOML, `uplot.min.js`) are dropped and
auto-pruned from any pre-task-69 index on the next `memhub code index`.
This deliberately reverses the earlier "index every tracked path" behavior:
on `tests/code_locate_golden.json` it lifted fusion Recall@1 0%→44% and
Recall@3 72%→89% by removing non-source files (notably the golden JSON
itself) that were out-ranking real code. The reranker A/B numbers recorded
in decision 114 predated this scoping; re-measured on the clean index they
showed fusion and rerank tied at 88.9% Recall@3 (decision 122), and task 85
(decision 123) then closed the two residual source-vs-source misses to take
fusion to 100% Recall@3 (see Retrieval default, above).

## Machine-global memory

Milestone 9 (design anchor:
[docs/reference/memhub-prd-addendum-m9-machine-global-memory.md](docs/reference/memhub-prd-addendum-m9-machine-global-memory.md))
adds an optional second store at `~/.memhub/global.sqlite`,
structurally identical to a repo DB (same embedded migrations;
`project_id = 1` is per-database, so zero new SQL migrations). It is
the global-vs-repo `AGENTS.md` idea made retrievable.

Off by default and **per-repo**: a repo opts in with
`memhub global enable` (mirrors `memhub metrics enable|disable`).
`enabled` lives in `.memhub/config.toml` `[global]`; the tracked
`.memhub/config.example.toml` baseline ships `false`. When disabled or
the store is absent, recall is byte-identical to a pre-M9 build (the
eval-regression guarantee).

When enabled, `recall` merges global hits with repo hits; every hit
carries `scope: "repo" | "global"`. **Precedence is
provenance-tag-only** — recall never drops a global hit and does no
automatic conflict resolution. Apply repo-overrides-global yourself
(exactly as repo `AGENTS.md` overrides global `AGENTS.md`).

Promotable to global: **facts, decisions, docs** only — machine/
toolchain truths, standing engineering policy, broadly-applicable
guides. Never global: tasks, rendered narrative, anything naming a
repo-specific path/symbol. Routing is **user-gated and never
agent-automatic** (one bad global write poisons every repo). Surfaces:
`memhub global enable|disable|status`, `--global` on
`fact|decision|doc add` and `doc ls|rm|show`,
`fact|decision promote <id> --global` (CLI) ·
`memhub.propose_fact|propose_decision(global=true)` (MCP — staged into
the repo's `pending_writes`, durable only on `memhub review accept`;
no `global` on MCP `doc_add`) · `/global` (skill). Global memory is
**not** exported by `memhub export` (per-machine; re-add on another
machine).

Onboarding exposes two explicit toggles — `[retrieval] mode` (fts vs
hybrid) and the machine-global store — plus two auto-followers with a
manual override: `[retrieval] use_reranker` (auto-on with hybrid) and
`[retrieval] include_docs_in_default` / its `[global]` mirror
(auto-flips true on the first `doc add` / `doc add --global`).

## Machine-wide upgrade

`memhub upgrade` (decision 96; resolves task 48, subsumes the
recurring stale-PATH-binary problem) is the one dependable command to
bring **every** memhub install on a machine to a coherent state after
a code change — the binary on PATH, each known repo DB, the global
store, and the installed agent skill wrappers — not just whichever
repo you rebuilt from. Run it **from the memhub source repo**; it
errors elsewhere.

Flow: `cargo install --path . --force` → one-time, order-independent
PATH-shadow fix (a regular-file `~/.local/bin/memhub` shadowing
`~/.cargo/bin/memhub` is replaced **once** with a symlink so future
installs always take effect; already-a-symlink is an idempotent no-op;
a non-symlink shadow is replaced only after a y/N confirm or `--yes`,
otherwise the manual `ln -sf` is printed) → installed-skill resync
(decision 97; below) → **re-exec the freshly installed binary** for the
migrate+verify pass so migrations run under new code → per-instance
`ready/migrated/skipped/ERROR` table plus a per-agent skills line
(`--json` carries a `skills` array). `--dry-run` reports the plan
(including would-sync skill counts) and changes nothing.

Skill resync (decision 97; resolves task 50, internalizes the fact-10
manual `cp`): the same `memhub upgrade` also refreshes the installed
slash-command wrappers so they never lag the binary. For each agent
dir that **already exists** — `~/.claude/commands/` (flat `*.md`),
`~/.codex/skills/` (dir-per-skill), `~/.config/opencode/skills/`
(dir-per-skill), and `~/.config/opencode/commands/` (flat `*.md`) — it
copies from the source repo's `templates/skills/{claude,codex,opencode}/`
and `templates/commands/opencode/`. It runs in the orchestrate phase
(the old binary, where `templates/` lives) and the result is rendered
by the re-exec'd child in one table. The copy is **additive**: a skill
removed/renamed in `templates/` leaves a harmless installed orphan —
settled against mirror-with-prune because pruning shared user-global
dirs risks a user's own same-named skill, while an orphan is just a
stale slash-command. Idempotent, best-effort (a partial/permission
error degrades to a `warn` row, never fails the upgrade — same posture
as the registry/metrics writes). `--no-skills` skips the step; the
binary + DB migrate still run. The manual `cp` recipe (fact 10) is now
a fallback only.

Instances are enumerated from a **self-maintaining registry**, never a
filesystem scan: every `db::open_project` does a single guarded,
debounced UPSERT into `known_projects` in `~/.memhub/global.sqlite`,
but **only if that store already exists** — the common
repo-with-no-global path pays one `stat`. A repo memhub has never
opened since this landed is absent from the first run but
self-migrates on its next open; seed it explicitly with `memhub
upgrade --also <path>` (repeatable; also persists it). Migration
`0015_known_projects` adds the table to the shared MIGRATIONS list; it
is read only from the global store.

Hard invariants: registry membership is **not** M9 global-memory
opt-in — recall never reads `known_projects` and stays gated on each
repo's own `[global] enabled` (a populated registry must not change
recall output: the eval-regression guarantee, tested in
`tests/upgrade_registry.rs`). `upgrade` migrates the global store only
if it already exists; it never creates it (opting in stays the
explicit `memhub global enable` choice). `known_projects` is
machine-local and **not** exported by `memhub export`. Skill resync
likewise only ever writes into an agent dir that already exists — it
never creates `~/.claude/commands`, `~/.codex/skills`,
`~/.config/opencode/skills`, or `~/.config/opencode/commands`, and a
non-directory at that path is a clean skip, not a clobber (mirrors the
PATH-shadow and global-store "only act on what exists" rule).

**Build-artifact GC (`memhub gc`).** Cargo's `target/<profile>/deps/`
is append-only — every rebuild writes a new hash-suffixed artifact and
never reclaims the old one; with memhub's `include_bytes!`'d ONNX
models each stale `libmemhub-<hash>.rlib` / test binary is ~1 GB, so a
few weeks of `cargo test` strands 100+ GB. `memhub gc` keeps only the
newest-mtime hash per **memhub-owned** stem (`memhub`, `libmemhub`,
each top-level `tests|benches|examples/*.rs` basename) and deletes the
superseded hashes plus their `.fingerprint/<stem>-<hash>` dirs.
Third-party dependency rlibs carry one hash, never balloon, and are
structurally never considered; `incremental/` is left alone (deleting
it only slows the next build). Worst case of pruning a superseded hash
is one rebuilt test binary — Cargo recovers, the current set is never
touched, so it cannot corrupt a tree. Runs **automatically inside
`memhub upgrade`** (best-effort, never fatal — same posture as the
skill/registry writes; `--no-gc` skips it, `--dry-run` reports it) and
standalone as `memhub gc [--dry-run] [--json]`. Pure `std::fs`,
OS-agnostic (macOS + Windows). Intentionally not a skill — ops
housekeeping like `upgrade` itself, surfaced via the CLI and the
upgrade flow.

## Current Build Focus

The repository currently provides Milestone 1 scaffolding and a usable local CLI foundation. Future work should extend from these boundaries instead of replacing them.

## Project state

Current project state (active tasks, durable decisions, known quirks)
is machine-local and lives in `.memhub/rendered/PROJECT.md`. Use
`memhub recall` mid-session and `memhub render` to refresh the local
view. Nothing under this section is committed to git — each machine
maintains its own DB and its own rendered view.
