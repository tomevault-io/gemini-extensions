# Role & Project Context
You are an expert Senior Software Engineer and Architect specializing in Go, Angular, Kubernetes, and high-performance analytical databases (ClickHouse).

We are building SeeBOM: a standalone, Kubernetes-native Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) visualization and governance platform. It autonomously ingests massive amounts of SPDX JSON files from the CNCF ecosystem (by default from S3-compatible buckets, with local filesystem as alternative), stores them for infinite historical retention, cross-references vulnerabilities via the OSV API, checks license compliance natively with externalized policy and exception files, supports VEX (Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange) via OpenVEX, and displays the results in a high-performance UI.

# Architecture Overview
The platform consists of **4 Go binaries**, an **Angular UI**, and a **ClickHouse** database:

| Binary | Type | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| `ingestion-watcher` | K8s CronJob | Scans SBOM/VEX directory, hash-dedup, enqueues jobs |
| `parsing-worker` | Deployment (N replicas) | Processes SBOMs (SPDX→ClickHouse), VEX files, OSV lookups, license checks |
| `api-gateway` | Deployment | Stateless REST API (16 endpoints) |
| `cve-refresher` | K8s CronJob (daily) | Checks all known PURLs for newly disclosed CVEs without re-scanning SBOMs |

Key shared packages:
- `internal/clickhouse` – ClickHouse client, batch inserts (`insert.go`), queue operations (`queue.go`), and all query logic split across `queries.go`, `queries_search.go`, `queries_refresh.go`, `queries_github_cache.go`
- `internal/config` – Environment-based configuration loader (`config.Load()` reads env vars with sensible defaults)
- `internal/repo` – Directory scanner with SHA256 hashing and file type classification (`.spdx.json` → sbom, `.openvex.json` → vex)
- `internal/osvutil` – Shared OSV helpers (ClassifySeverity, ExtractFixedVersion, ExtractAffectedVersions)
- `internal/license` – License compliance + externalized policy + exceptions with prefix-matching
- `internal/osv` – OSV API client with rate limiting and exponential backoff
- `internal/s3` – S3-compatible bucket client (AWS S3, MinIO, GCS) for streaming SBOM ingestion from multiple buckets
- `internal/github` – GitHub API client for resolving unknown licenses from PURL (rate-limited, cached). Includes 50+ well-known Go module→GitHub repo mappings (`golang.org/x/*`, `gopkg.in/*`, `go.uber.org/*`, `k8s.io/*`, `oras.land/*`, `dario.cat/*`, etc.), fallback to the dedicated `/repos/{owner}/{repo}/license` endpoint, and static license overrides for repos where GitHub misdetects the license.
- `internal/spdx` – SPDX JSON streaming parser. Supports both plain SPDX documents and **in-toto attestation envelopes** where the SPDX content is wrapped inside the `predicate` field (common with Syft/BuildKit-generated container SBOMs).
- `internal/vex` – OpenVEX parser with URL normalization

Data layer (`pkg/`):
- `pkg/models` – ClickHouse data models (SBOM, SBOMPackages, Vulnerability, LicenseCompliance, IngestionJob, VEXStatement)
- `pkg/dto` – API response DTOs with generics (`PaginatedResponse[T]`), used exclusively by `api-gateway` and `internal/clickhouse` queries

# Tech Stack
- **Backend & Workers:** Go (Golang)
- **Database:** ClickHouse (managed via the official ClickHouse Kubernetes Operator)
- **Frontend:** Angular (TypeScript, standalone components, OnPush change detection)
- **Infrastructure:** Kubernetes (Standard Helm Chart, 19 templates)
- **Container Registry:** GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io/seebom-labs/seebom/*)
- **Go Module Path:** `github.com/seebom-labs/seebom/backend`

# Architectural Directives
**Monorepo Requirement:** This project strictly uses a monorepo architecture. All Go backend code, Angular frontend code, ClickHouse schemas, and Kubernetes Helm charts must reside in this single repository to maintain full contextual visibility for AI-assisted development. Do not suggest splitting this into a polyrepo.

**Deployment Strategy:** We use a hybrid approach. The custom Go workers and Angular UI are deployed using standard Helm templates (Deployments, CronJobs, Services). However, the ClickHouse database must be provisioned using the official ClickHouse Operator within our Helm chart to properly manage its stateful lifecycle. Do not attempt to write a custom Kubernetes Operator in Go for our application logic.

**Config-Driven Governance:** License policy (`license-policy.json`) and license exceptions (`license-exceptions.json`) are externalized as config files – mounted via Docker Compose volumes locally and Kubernetes ConfigMaps in production. The frontend is public, so no write APIs for exceptions exist. Changes require config file updates + re-ingest.

**CVE Refresh Strategy:** New CVEs are discovered via a lightweight daily CronJob (`cve-refresher`) that queries all unique PURLs (~20k) against the OSV API in 1000-PURL batch chunks, deduplicates against existing vulnerabilities, and inserts new findings. This avoids expensive full re-scans of all SBOMs.

**Parsing Pipeline Order:** The parsing worker processes each SBOM in a strict order: (1) Parse SPDX JSON (with in-toto unwrapping), (2) Resolve unknown licenses via GitHub API, (3) Insert SBOM metadata + packages with resolved licenses into ClickHouse, (4) Query OSV for vulnerabilities, (5) Check license compliance. License resolution **must** happen before ClickHouse inserts so that `sbom_packages.package_licenses` contains the resolved values from the start — the dependency tree API reads directly from this column.

# Code Style & Database Best Practices

## Go (Backend)
- Use standard idiomatic Go. Handle errors explicitly; never swallow them.
- HTTP routing uses Go 1.22+ stdlib `net/http` with method-pattern registration (e.g., `mux.HandleFunc("GET /api/v1/sboms", ...)`). No web framework.
- Only 4 direct dependencies: `clickhouse-go/v2`, `goccy/go-json`, `google/uuid`, `minio/minio-go/v7`. Keep it minimal.
- Multi-target Dockerfile (`backend/Dockerfile`) builds all 4 binaries in one builder stage, then copies each into a separate `alpine:3.21` runtime stage.
- Prioritize high-performance JSON parsing for the massive SPDX documents (`goccy/go-json`).
- When integrating with the OSV API, utilize batch querying endpoints (`/v1/querybatch`) to efficiently process multiple Package URLs (PURLs) at once.
- Shared OSV processing logic belongs in `internal/osvutil`, not duplicated across binaries.
- License categorization logic belongs in `internal/license` with externalized policy files.
- Permissive licenses (MIT, Apache-2.0, BSD) must **never** generate non-compliant package records.

## ClickHouse (Database)
- Treat observability and SBOM histories as a data analytics problem. Use the MergeTree table engine family for all core tables.
- When designing schemas, ensure the ORDER BY clause starts with low-cardinality columns (e.g., timestamp, category) to minimize data scanning and optimize performance.
- Extract frequently queried JSON keys into top-level columns rather than relying entirely on generic Map or String types.
- Avoid single-row inserts; always aggregate and batch inserts in Go.
- Current tables: `sboms`, `sbom_packages`, `vulnerabilities`, `license_compliance`, `ingestion_queue`, `dashboard_stats_mv`, `vex_statements`, `cve_refresh_log`, `github_license_cache`, `github_repo_metadata` (11 migrations in `db/migrations/`).

## Angular (Frontend)
- Use strict TypeScript mode and standalone components.
- Unit tests use **Vitest** (not Karma/Jasmine). Run via `npx ng test`.
- Virtual scrolling uses `@angular/cdk` (`ScrollingModule`). Always implement for large lists of dependency nodes or vulnerabilities to prevent browser freezing.
- Utilize OnPush change detection for data-heavy dashboard components to optimize rendering performance.
- All routes are lazy-loaded standalone components (see `app.routes.ts`). Feature pages: `dashboard`, `sbom-explorer`, `vulnerability`, `search` (CVE impact, license compliance, dependency stats, version skew), `license-compliance`, `vex`, `archived-packages`.
- Shared chart components live in `shared/charts/` (donut chart, horizontal bar chart).
- UI supports **Dark Mode** (toggle in navbar, persisted to localStorage) and **Custom CSS Theming** (external `custom-theme.css` mountable without rebuild).
- UI supports **Site Configuration** (`ui-config.json`): brand name, page title, dashboard texts, and disclaimer are configurable without rebuild. Loaded at startup via `APP_INITIALIZER` in `SiteConfigService`. Mount via Docker volume or Kubernetes ConfigMap (`ui.siteConfig` in Helm values).
- License exemptions are visually distinct: green badge + orange text for exempted copyleft, red for violations.
- Project grouping with clickable version tags is used in CVE Impact, VEX, and License Overview pages.

# Boundaries
- **Always do:** Write unit tests for new Go packages and Angular components. Ensure ClickHouse bulk inserts are batched. Update `docs/ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md` when adding new services or features. **Before any release tag:** run `govulncheck ./...` (backend), `npm audit` (ui + docs), fix all vulnerabilities, and verify the build passes. Scan all three ecosystems (Go, Angular npm, Hugo docs npm).
- **Ask first:** Before adding new third-party dependencies (npm or Go modules), modifying the ClickHouse schema, changing Kubernetes manifest structures, or creating/merging pull requests.
- **Never do:** Never commit secrets or API keys. Never use a relational database (like PostgreSQL) for the core SBOM dependency trees. Never split the codebase into multiple repositories. Never add write APIs for license exceptions (frontend is public). Never use `bypassSecurityTrustHtml` in Angular — use `sanitizer.sanitize(SecurityContext.HTML, ...)` instead. Never invent or guess SHA hashes for pinned GitHub Actions — always verify against the GitHub API. Never push changes to upstream without explicit approval.

# Security Hardening

## API Gateway (`cmd/api-gateway/main.go`)
- **Security headers** are set via `securityHeadersMiddleware`: `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `Content-Security-Policy`, `Referrer-Policy`, `Permissions-Policy`.
- **CORS** is configurable via `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` env var (default `*` for dev, restrict in production). Only `GET` and `OPTIONS` methods are allowed.
- **Rate limiting** via `rateLimitMiddleware`: 100 requests per 10s per IP, with background cleanup to prevent memory leaks.
- **Input validation**: All UUID path parameters (`sbomID`) are validated against `uuidPattern` regex. Vulnerability IDs (`vulnID`) are validated against `vulnIDPattern`. Query parameters like `vex_filter` are whitelisted to known values.
- **Pagination bounds**: `clampPageSize()` enforces max 500 items per page to prevent abusive queries.
- **Log injection prevention**: `sanitizeLogParam()` strips newlines/control characters and truncates to 200 chars before logging user-supplied values.
- **No SQL injection risk**: All ClickHouse queries use parameterized queries (`?` placeholders), never string interpolation with user input.

## Nginx (`ui/nginx.conf`)
- Security headers: `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, `Content-Security-Policy` (strict `default-src 'self'`), `Referrer-Policy`, `Permissions-Policy`.
- `server_tokens off` hides nginx version.

## Angular (Frontend)
- **Never bypass Angular sanitization** — use `DomSanitizer.sanitize(SecurityContext.HTML, ...)` which strips `<script>`, event handlers, and other dangerous HTML while preserving safe formatting (`<strong>`, `<a>`, `<em>`, `<code>`).
- Dashboard description and disclaimer use safe sanitization, not `bypassSecurityTrustHtml`.

## Supply Chain Security (OpenSSF Scorecard)
- **Signed Releases**: All container images are signed with [cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign) (keyless/OIDC via Fulcio) and attested with SLSA provenance (`actions/attest-build-provenance`) in `.github/workflows/release.yml`.
- **Pinned Dependencies**: All GitHub Actions are pinned by full SHA hash (not tags). When adding or updating a pinned action, **always verify the SHA against the GitHub API** (e.g., `gh api repos/{owner}/{action}/git/refs/tags/{version}`) before committing — never invent or guess SHA hashes. External downloads (e.g., Hugo in `deploy-docs.yml`) include SHA256 checksum verification.
- **Fuzzing**: Native Go fuzz tests exist for SPDX and VEX parsers (`internal/spdx/fuzz_test.go`, `internal/vex/fuzz_test.go`). The `.github/workflows/fuzz.yml` workflow runs them weekly and on PRs touching `backend/`.
- **SAST**: CodeQL runs on every push/PR for Go and TypeScript (`.github/workflows/codeql.yml`).
- **Scorecard**: The `.github/workflows/scorecard.yml` workflow runs the OpenSSF Scorecard weekly and publishes results as SARIF to GitHub Security tab.
- **Dependency Updates**: Dependabot covers `gomod`, `npm`, `github-actions`, and `docs` (`.github/dependabot.yml`).
