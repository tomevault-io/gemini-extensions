## Architecture

### Core Philosophy
Spotter separates "Providers" (sources of user data like history/playlists) from "Enrichers" (sources of metadata). Both use a Factory pattern for instantiation based on the current user context.

### Database (Ent)
- **Schema**: Defined in `ent/schema`
- **Generation**: Run `go generate ./ent` after schema changes
- **Usage**: Use the generated client for all DB operations. Avoid raw SQL.
- **Traversals**: Prefer Ent traversals over manual joins

### Providers (`internal/providers`)
Providers handle user-specific data interaction (Listen History, Playlists).

**Required Interfaces** (defined in `providers.go`):
- `HistoryFetcher`: Syncing listening history (handling pagination/cursors)
- `PlaylistManager`: Reading/Creating playlists
- `PlaylistSyncer`: Syncing playlists between services
- `Authenticator`: Handling OAuth flows

**Authentication:**
- Implement `Authenticator` for OAuth services (Spotify, Last.fm)
- **Token Management**: Auto-refresh tokens within provider methods. Callers should not handle expired tokens.
- **State**: Persist tokens via `ent` edges (e.g., `User.Edges.SpotifyAuth`)

**Factories**: `New(logger, config)` returns a `Factory` function `func(ctx, user) (Provider, error)`

### Enrichers (`internal/enrichers`)
Enrichers add metadata, images, and AI-generated content to local entities.

**Required Interfaces** (defined in `enrichers.go`):
- `IDMatcher`: **Critical**. Matches local names to external IDs (e.g., Name → Spotify ID)
- `ArtistEnricher`, `AlbumEnricher`, `TrackEnricher`: Fetches metadata using IDs

**Implementation:**
- Implement `IsAvailable() bool` to check if config/auth is present
- Return standardized structs (`ArtistData`, `AlbumData`)
- Download and resize images locally; do not store hotlinks

## Coding Standards

### Error Handling
- Use `fmt.Errorf("context: %w", err)` for wrapping
- Never panic
- Log errors with structured attributes using `slog`

### Context
- Pass `context.Context` as the first argument to all IO-bound functions
- Respect context cancellation

### Testing
- **Mocking**: Use `httptest.NewServer` to mock external APIs
- **No Network**: Tests must not make real network calls
- **Coverage**: Test happy paths, 401/403 (Auth), 429 (Rate Limits), and 404s
- **Regression Tests**: **MANDATORY** for all bug fixes
  - Write regression test BEFORE fixing the bug
  - Test MUST fail without the fix
  - Test MUST pass with the fix
  - Test name MUST include "Regression" prefix (e.g., `TestLogin_Regression_WhiteScreen`)
  - Test MUST document the original issue and bead ID in comments

### External API Etiquette
- **Rate Limiting**: Handle 429 responses gracefully (exponential backoff or error)
- **Batching**: Use batch APIs where possible (e.g., Spotify Audio Features)
- **User Agent**: Set a descriptive User-Agent string

## Linting & Code Quality

Spotter uses multiple linters to enforce code quality standards across all languages and file types. **Linting is mandatory before committing code.**

### Running Linters

```bash
make lint          # Run all linters (RECOMMENDED)
make lint-go       # Go code only (golangci-lint)
make lint-templ    # Templ templates only
make lint-yaml     # YAML files only
make lint-md       # Markdown documentation only
make lint-docker   # Dockerfile only
```

**When to run linters:**
- Before every `git commit`
- After making code changes
- When CI fails on linting
- Before closing issues

### Linters in Use

#### 1. **golangci-lint** (Go Code)
- **Purpose**: Meta-linter running 14+ Go linters in parallel
- **Config**: `.golangci.yml`
- **Enabled linters**: govet, staticcheck, errcheck, gosimple, ineffassign, unused, gofmt, goimports, misspell, revive, typecheck, goconst, unconvert, gocritic
- **Exclusions**: Generated code (`ent/`, `*_gen.go`, `*_templ.go`)
- **Timeout**: 5 minutes

**Common issues:**
```go
// ❌ BAD: Unchecked error
defer resp.Body.Close()

// ✅ GOOD: Check error
defer func() {
    if err := resp.Body.Close(); err != nil {
        log.Error("failed to close response body", "error", err)
    }
}()
```

#### 2. **templ fmt** (Templ Templates)
- **Purpose**: Format validation for `.templ` files
- **Config**: Built-in templ formatter
- **Files**: All 38 `.templ` files in `internal/views/`
- **Auto-fix**: Run `templ fmt .` (without `-fail`) to auto-format

#### 3. **yamllint** (YAML Files)
- **Purpose**: YAML syntax and formatting validation
- **Config**: `.yamllint.yml`
- **Standards**: 2-space indentation, 120 char line length
- **Exclusions**: `node_modules/`, `.git/`
- **Files**: `.github/workflows/`, config files

#### 4. **markdownlint** (Markdown Documentation)
- **Purpose**: Consistent documentation formatting
- **Config**: `.markdownlint.json`
- **Files**: `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `SECURITY.md`, all `internal/*/README.md`
- **Standards**:
  - Line length: Disabled (too strict)
  - Allow inline HTML: `<details>`, `<summary>`, `<br>`, `<img>`
  - First line heading requirement: Disabled

#### 5. **hadolint** (Dockerfile)
- **Purpose**: Dockerfile best practices and security
- **Config**: `.hadolint.yaml`
- **Method**: Docker-based (hadolint/hadolint:latest)
- **Threshold**: Error-level only (warnings won't fail build)

### CI Integration

Linting runs automatically in GitHub Actions on:
- All pull requests to `main`
- All pushes to `main`

**CI Workflow:**
```
lint job (runs first)
  ├─ Set up Go 1.24 with caching
  ├─ Set up Node.js 20 with npm caching
  ├─ Install dependencies (golangci-lint, templ, yamllint, markdownlint)
  ├─ Run `make lint`
  └─ Fail-fast on first linting error
       ↓
test job (requires lint to pass)
  └─ Run `make test`
       ↓
build-and-push job (requires test to pass)
  └─ Build and push Docker image
```

**If linting fails in CI:**
1. Check the GitHub Actions log for specific errors
2. Run `make lint` locally to reproduce
3. Fix the issues or run auto-fixers (see below)
4. Commit fixes and push

### Auto-Fixing Linting Issues

Some linters can automatically fix issues:

```bash
# Go formatting
gofmt -w .
go run golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports@latest -w .

# Templ formatting
templ fmt .

# Markdown formatting (manual fixes usually required)
# YAML formatting (manual fixes usually required)
```

**IMPORTANT:** Always run `make lint` and `make test` after auto-fixing to ensure no breakage.

### Common Linting Errors

**Go (errcheck):**
```go
// ❌ Error: Error return value not checked
defer file.Close()

// ✅ Fix: Check and handle error
defer func() {
    if err := file.Close(); err != nil {
        slog.Error("failed to close file", "error", err)
    }
}()
```

**Go (shadow):**
```go
// ❌ Error: Variable shadows outer declaration
err := someFunc()
if err != nil {
    err := anotherFunc()  // shadows outer err
}

// ✅ Fix: Use different variable name or check inline
err := someFunc()
if err != nil {
    if err2 := anotherFunc(); err2 != nil {
        // ...
    }
}
```

**YAML:**
```yaml
# ❌ Error: Line too long
some_key: this is a very long value that exceeds the 120 character limit and should be wrapped

# ✅ Fix: Break into multiple lines
some_key: |
  this is a very long value that exceeds the limit
  and is now wrapped properly
```

**Markdown:**
```markdown
<!-- ❌ Error: MD033 - Inline HTML -->
<div>Some content</div>

<!-- ✅ Fix: Use allowed elements or convert to Markdown -->
<details>
<summary>Some content</summary>
...
</details>
```

### Documentation Commands

```bash
# Install documentation dependencies
make docs-deps

# Start local dev server with hot-reload
make docs-serve
# Opens at http://localhost:3000/spotter/

# Build static documentation site
make docs-build
# Output in website/build/

# Clean documentation artifacts
make docs-clean
```

### Writing Documentation

**File locations:**
- New feature docs go in `website/docs/features/`
- Provider docs go in `website/docs/providers/`
- Enricher docs go in `website/docs/enrichers/`
- API docs go in `website/docs/api/`

**Frontmatter:**
```markdown
---
sidebar_position: 1
---

# Page Title

Content here...
```

**Sidebar navigation:**
- Edit `website/sidebars.ts` to add new pages to navigation
- Pages are ordered by `sidebar_position` in frontmatter

**Admonitions (callouts):**
```markdown
:::note
Informational note
:::

:::tip
Helpful tip
:::

:::caution
Warning message
:::

:::danger
Critical warning
:::
```

### Documentation Deployment

Documentation automatically deploys to GitHub Pages when:
- Changes are pushed to `main` branch in the `website/` directory
- The `deploy-docs.yml` workflow runs

**Manual deployment:**
```bash
cd website
npm run build
npm run deploy
```

**Deployment URL:** https://joestump.github.io/spotter/

### Documentation Linting

Documentation is validated in two ways:

1. **Markdown linting** (`make lint-md`) - Enforces consistent formatting
2. **Docusaurus build** (`make lint-docs`) - Validates links and structure

Both run automatically as part of `make lint`.

**Running documentation checks:**
```bash
make lint          # Run all linters including docs build
make lint-md       # Markdown formatting only
make lint-docs     # Docusaurus build only (catches broken links)
```

**Before submitting PRs that touch `website/`:**
```bash
cd website && npm run build   # Or: make lint-docs
```

The Docusaurus build will **fail on broken links** (`onBrokenLinks: 'throw'` in config).

**Common link patterns and pitfalls:**

| Pattern | Correct | Incorrect |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| Internal docs | `/docs/getting-started/installation` | `/docs/getting-started` (missing page) |
| Section links | `/docs/features/themes` | `/docs/configuration` (wrong path) |
| Relative links | `./configuration` | `../configuration` (wrong level) |

**Common link errors:**
- Missing `/installation` or `/configuration` suffix on getting-started links
- Linking to category folders instead of actual pages
- Typos in document slugs

**Markdown formatting fixes:**
- Use allowed HTML elements (details, summary, div, span)
- Avoid inline HTML when possible
- Add blank lines around code blocks
- Use consistent heading levels

### Adding New Documentation

1. Create markdown file in appropriate `website/docs/` subdirectory
2. Add frontmatter with `sidebar_position`
3. Add to `website/sidebars.ts` if not auto-detected
4. Run `make docs-serve` to preview
5. Run `make lint-md` to verify markdown
6. Commit changes - auto-deploys on merge to main

## Adding New Features or Configuration

When adding new features or configuration options, you MUST update all relevant files:

### New Configuration Options

| File | Action |
|------|--------|
| `internal/config/config.go` | Add struct field and `SetDefault()` |
| `.env.example` | Add example with comment |
| `website/docs/getting-started/configuration.md` | Add to appropriate table and example |

### New Features or Functionality

| File | Action |
|------|--------|
| `website/docs/` | Add or update feature documentation |
| `AGENTS.md` | Update if workflow/standards change |
| `README.md` | Update if user-facing features change |

**CRITICAL:** Documentation updates MUST be included in the same PR as the feature. Do not create separate PRs for docs.

## Keeping AGENTS.md Updated

**META-RULE:** When workflow instructions are updated (Git, Beads, testing, etc.), AGENTS.md MUST be updated to reflect the changes. This ensures the documentation stays in sync with current practices and all contributors follow the same workflow.
