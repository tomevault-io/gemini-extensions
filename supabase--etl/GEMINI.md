# Repository Guidelines

## Workspace Layout
- Rust workspace crates live under `crates/`:
  - `crates/etl/`: core replication library.
  - `crates/etl-api/`: HTTP API service.
  - `crates/etl-replicator/`: standalone replicator binary.
  - `crates/etl-postgres/`: Postgres integration.
  - `crates/etl-destinations/`: destination implementations.
  - `crates/etl-config/`: configuration types and loading.
  - `crates/etl-telemetry/`: tracing and Prometheus setup.
  - `crates/etl-examples/`: examples.
  - `crates/etl-benchmarks/`: benchmarks.
  - `crates/xtask/`: workspace automation commands.
- Docs live in `docs/`.
- Local development and ops tooling live in `crates/xtask/` (run via `cargo x`) and `DEVELOPMENT.md`.
- Tests live next to code in `src/` or `tests/`.

## Commands
- Build everything:
  - `cargo build --workspace --all-targets --all-features`
- Format:
  - `cargo x fmt`
- Check formatting:
  - `cargo x fmt --check`
- Lint:
  - `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`
- Run unit tests (no Postgres required):
  - `cargo nextest run --workspace --all-features --lib`
- Run tests for one crate:
  - `cargo nextest run -p etl-config --all-features`
- Run doctests (nextest does not support doctests):
  - `cargo test --doc --workspace --all-features`
- List tests:
  - `cargo nextest list --workspace --all-features`
- Run full test suite (requires Postgres clusters via `cargo xtask postgres start`):
  - `cargo xtask nextest run`

## Agent Workflow
- Keep changes focused on the issue being solved.
- Prefer small diffs unless a broader refactor is clearly justified.
- Before adding new patterns, inspect nearby code and follow the local style first.
- Do not add dependencies unless they are justified by the task.
- If you change workflow assumptions, build or test the smallest relevant target and report what actually ran.
- Never create commits, push branches, open pull requests, or perform other git write actions unless the user explicitly instructs you to do so.
- Never modify migration files unless the user explicitly asks for a migration
  change. This includes changing comments or other non-executable text inside
  migration files.
- Keep the workspace on the stable toolchain from `rust-toolchain.toml` for build, lint, and test commands; use the pinned nightly formatter only through `cargo x fmt` and `cargo x fmt --check`.
- Treat `Cargo.toml` workspace lints, `rustfmt.toml`, and compiler diagnostics as the source of truth for enforceable style and correctness rules. Prefer adding or tightening static checks over adding prose rules here.
- Run Clippy, builds, and tests intentionally when they are relevant: for example
  after changing Rust code, when compiler/lint diagnostics indicate a problem,
  when workflow assumptions changed, or when the user asks for verification. Do
  not run expensive checks reflexively for unrelated documentation, YAML-only, or
  similarly low-risk edits; in those cases, run the smallest relevant validation
  instead and report what actually ran.
- Add local destination value validation only when it prevents silent data
  corruption, such as rounding, truncation, clamping, coercion, or another
  semantic change that the destination would accept. If the destination rejects
  an unsupported value with an error, prefer delegating that check to the
  destination instead of duplicating expensive validation in the write path.

## Public Repo Secret Safety
- Treat this repository, every branch, every commit, every PR, and every review
  comment as public by default. Assume anything written to tracked files, commit
  metadata, terminal output quoted in a PR, screenshots, logs, comments, and
  generated artifacts can become permanently visible.
- Never include real secrets, credentials, tokens, API keys, service keys,
  passwords, private URLs, private hostnames, customer data, personal data, raw
  production payloads, internal incident details, or proprietary configuration
  values in code, tests, docs, comments, examples, commit messages, branch
  names, PR titles, PR descriptions, review comments, issue comments, logs, or
  generated files.
- Before writing or modifying files, scan the relevant context for suspicious
  values. Before any git write action that the user explicitly requested, review
  the staged diff, commit message, branch name, PR title, PR body, and any
  comments for possible sensitive information.
- If a value looks real, came from the user's environment, appeared in local
  config, came from command output, or was copied from any non-public source, do
  not commit it or repeat it in comments or PR text. Stop and ask the user
  before proceeding, explaining the specific risk without quoting the sensitive
  value back.
- Use invented, clearly fake placeholders for examples and tests, such as
  `example.com`, `127.0.0.1`, `placeholder-token`, `fake-api-key`, or
  documented test credentials already present in the repository. Prefer
  redacted forms such as `<redacted>` when discussing an existing sensitive
  value.
- Keep secrets out of source control entirely. Use environment variables,
  ignored local files, secret managers, CI secret storage, or documented local
  setup steps instead of tracked files.
- Do not add secret-like material to rustdoc, inline comments, snapshots,
  fixtures, golden files, debug output, telemetry, panic messages, error
  details, or assertion messages. This applies even when the value is only used
  in tests.
- When reviewing code, explicitly flag suspected secret exposure or unsafe
  handling of sensitive values as a high-priority finding. Include the file and
  line location, but do not reproduce the full secret in the review text.
- If a secret appears to have been committed or exposed, stop normal work and
  warn the user immediately. Recommend rotation or revocation of the affected
  credential and avoid commands that would further spread the value, such as
  pushing, opening a PR, or pasting the diff into chat.
- Keep user-facing updates transparent while working on sensitive areas: mention
  when you are checking diffs, commit metadata, PR text, logs, fixtures, or
  generated artifacts for leaks, and report what was checked.

## Rust Style
- This section is only for project-specific judgment that is not already covered by rustfmt, rustc, or Clippy.
- Prefer absolute crate imports for shared module items, for example `use crate::metrics::{PIPELINE_ID_LABEL, APP_TYPE_LABEL};`, instead of `use super::{...};`.
- Write SQL queries with lowercase SQL keywords and identifiers, unless quoting or an external API requires specific casing.
- When multiple files share constants, helpers, or a single entrypoint, prefer a module directory with `mod.rs`.
- Use crate boundaries for reuse across crates, not for organizing code inside
  one domain. Keep code in its owning crate unless another crate has a real
  dependency on that API.
- Use module boundaries for domain concepts. Prefer names such as `schema`,
  `data`, `event`, `store`, `source`, or `slots` over generic buckets like
  `types`, `utils`, or `common`.
- Keep replication behavior and replication-specific domain types in `etl`.
  Keep reusable Postgres primitives, source database helpers, slot helpers, and
  SQL access to ETL-owned Postgres metadata tables in `etl-postgres`.
- Prefer flat module files such as `schema.rs` or `event.rs` when the module
  has no child modules. Use a directory with `mod.rs` only when the module owns
  multiple child modules or needs a clear grouped entrypoint.
- Avoid compatibility facades and wildcard re-exports during structural
  refactors unless the facade is an intentional public API. Public re-exports
  should live in domain modules and represent the API callers should actually
  use.
- For external crate ergonomics, expose the smallest useful setup surface from
  `etl`: pipeline configuration/building, destination and store traits, ETL
  schema/data/event types, and dependency types that callers must use to
  implement those traits. Keep worker orchestration, Postgres codec internals,
  runtime plumbing, and store implementation details private or crate-private.
- Keep top-level binaries focused on orchestration; move implementation detail into helpers or modules.
- Prefer clear, boring code over clever abstractions.
- Prefer existing workspace patterns over introducing new local conventions.
- Keep item order local and readable: place supporting helpers and types before
  their use when practical, and group type-centered code as `struct`, inherent
  `impl`, then trait impls. Within inherent impls, put constructors first,
  externally visible methods next, and private helpers last.
- Do not add `#[must_use]` attributes unless the user explicitly asks for one.
- Put rustdoc comments above all attributes on the item they document,
  including `#[derive(...)]`, `#[serde(...)]`, `#[cfg_attr(...)]`, and macro
  attributes such as `#[macro_export]`.
- Default to private visibility and only widen when a real caller requires it.
- Prefer the narrowest working visibility in this order: private, `pub(super)`, `pub(crate)`, then `pub`.
- Use `pub` only for intentional crate APIs consumed by other crates, integration tests, examples, or documented user-facing entrypoints.
- Keep struct fields private by default; prefer constructors, accessors, and focused helper methods over exposing mutable fields.
- When a module is internal, tighten the module itself before leaving deep items `pub`.
- In `mod.rs` and other module roots, prefer private child modules plus selective `pub use` lists over `pub mod` or `pub use child::*` when building a facade API.
- Treat `pub use` as part of the public API contract: re-export only items you intentionally want callers to depend on, and avoid wildcard re-exports from internal modules.
- When a crate re-exports dependency types through an intentional domain module,
  prefer referring to them via that domain module (for example
  `crate::schema::SchemaError`) inside that crate unless you are working at an
  explicit integration boundary or the item is not re-exported.
- After visibility changes, verify with `cargo rustc -p <crate> --all-features -- -W unreachable_pub` for the relevant target and then rerun the smallest relevant checks/tests.
- Keep log message prose lowercase; SQL fragments, identifiers, and external product names may keep their required casing.
- Prefer `From`/`TryFrom` numeric conversions over `as` casts when the trait
  conversion exists or a value was explicitly range-checked. Use `as` for
  intentionally lossy conversions or conversions that Rust does not expose via
  `From`, such as `u64` to `f64` metric values.
- Use `From` for value-to-value conversions only when the mapping is
  infallible, lossless in the semantic sense, value-preserving, and obvious.
- Model patch-style API updates so omitted fields preserve stored values,
  explicit `null` clears optional values or resets defaulted values, and
  non-null values replace stored values. When converting a non-patch API config
  into an update config, use an explicit helper such as `from_api_config`, not
  `From`, because absent optional fields become `Clear`, not `Preserve`.

## Error Handling And Panics
- Use typed errors and `Result` for recoverable failures.
- Propagate errors with context instead of flattening to strings. When wrapping
  a real error, attach it with `source: error` or
  `.with_source(error)` instead of embedding `{error}`, `error.to_string()`, or
  `format!("{error}")` into the message or detail. Keep detail fields for
  contextual data we own, such as operation names, table names, IDs, counts, or
  SQL statements.
- Prefer preserving lower-level failures in the error source chain so display,
  logging, and Sentry formatting can decide how much of the chain to show. Only
  copy an underlying error message into a description or detail when that is
  intentionally safer or clearer, such as replacing a sensitive internal error
  with a sanitized customer-facing explanation.
- Do not leak Postgres, SQLx, or other database errors from `etl-api` HTTP
  responses. Keep the original error in the internal chain and logs, but return
  a generic customer-facing message for database failures.
- Keep ETL Postgres and DuckDB errors useful for internal debugging by
  preserving the source chain and owned context, while still avoiding highly
  critical data.
- Error messages should use normal sentence casing and start with an uppercase
  letter. This applies to static error text, including `thiserror` messages.
- Reserve panics for programmer errors or violated invariants.
- Use `debug_assert!` and `unreachable!` where they make internal invariants explicit, but prefer typed errors for runtime failures that can be triggered by external input or system state.
- Only document `# Panics` when a function can actually panic.

### Parser Safety
- Parser entrypoints and helpers that consume external input should not panic
  for malformed input. Return a typed parse error, `EtlError`, `Option::None`,
  or another explicit failure value that matches the surrounding API.
- Treat unexpected end of input, malformed tokens, invalid byte sequences,
  invalid numeric or temporal ranges, and unsupported syntax as recoverable
  parser failures, not internal invariants.
- Prefer checked access such as `slice.get(index)`, `str::get(range)`,
  iterator methods, or byte-slice parsing when input controls indexes or
  ranges. Convert `None` into the parser's error type.
- Direct indexing with `[]` is acceptable only when the invariant is local and
  obvious, such as `bytes[index]` inside `while index < bytes.len()` or fixed
  chunk indexes after `chunks_exact`. Use bytes rather than `str` byte ranges
  when parsing ASCII protocols so non-ASCII malformed input cannot panic on a
  UTF-8 boundary.
- `expect`, `panic!`, and `unreachable!` in parser internals are reserved for
  broken programmer invariants that prior code has guaranteed. The message
  should state the invariant, for example `expect("validated token index should
  be in bounds")`.
- Add regression tests for malformed inputs that exercise boundary cases:
  empty input, unterminated quotes or escapes, invalid UTF-8-adjacent text,
  non-ASCII bytes in ASCII formats, overflow, underflow, and unsupported
  syntax.

## Unsafe And Concurrency
- Avoid `unsafe` unless it is necessary.
- Every `unsafe` block should have a preceding `// SAFETY:` comment explaining why it is sound.
- Prefer explicit ownership and borrowing over unnecessary cloning or interior mutability.
- In async code, keep long-running background work behind named tasks or helpers.
- Be intentional about Tokio task shutdown semantics. Dropping a
  `JoinHandle` detaches the task; call `abort()` for best-effort background
  tasks such as metrics reporters when they should stop immediately.
- Dropping a Tokio `JoinSet` aborts all tasks in the set. Do not call
  `abort_all()` before returning from a scope that owns the `JoinSet`; use
  `abort_all()` only when the set is retained and tasks must be stopped while
  the set remains alive.
- Prefer graceful shutdown signaling and joining only when tasks own state that
  must be completed or unwound deliberately, such as database transactions,
  destination flushes, or retry-sensitive replication work.
- Avoid elaborate shutdown channels for timer, polling, or telemetry tasks
  whose state can be safely discarded.

## Documentation
- Document all items, public and private, using concise stdlib-style prose.
- Link types and methods as [`Type`] and [`Type::method`].
- In public or module-level docs, prefer fully qualified rustdoc links such as
  [`crate::store::PipelineStore`] when referencing items outside the current
  module.
- In item docs where the type is already imported and central to the code,
  short rustdoc links such as [`StateStore`] are fine.
- Do not add imports solely to make rustdoc links shorter.
- Keep comments and docs precise, short, and punctuated.
- Normal comments should always end with `.`.
- Prefer normal comments on the line above the code they explain instead of
  trailing comments at the end of a code line.
- Do not add code examples in rustdoc for this repository.

## Metrics And Observability
- Define metric names and label keys as constants instead of inlining string literals at call sites.
- Centralize shared metric labels or tag values in the parent metrics module when multiple metric files use them.
- Register metric descriptions once using `std::sync::Once` or another one-time initialization pattern.
- For background metric polling, prefer one `spawn_*_metrics_task` helper per source and one orchestration helper that starts them.
- Prefer low-cardinality labels unless higher-cardinality labels are operationally necessary.
- Do not log highly critical sensitive information: passwords, secrets, tokens,
  request or response bodies for sensitive API endpoints, or source row/cell
  values. Prefer metadata that helps debugging without exposing values, such as
  table and column names, type names, counts, lengths, LSNs, IDs, and operation
  names.
- When adding logs, metrics, traces, Sentry context, panic messages, or other
  observability output, be extra careful not to leak customer data or detailed
  table contents. Higher-level structural metadata, such as table names, column
  names, type names, counts, lengths, IDs, and operation names, can be included
  when useful for debugging; do not include cell values, row payloads, request
  or response bodies, credentials, tokens, or secrets.
- In production logs, key errors as `error = %err` or `error = %error`
  regardless of the local variable name. Do not use `err =`, `source =`, or
  debug formatting for the primary error field.
- Prefer `Display` formatting (`%`) or explicit structured fields over
  `Debug` formatting (`?`) for structs in logs, unless the type is known not to
  contain sensitive values.
- For table state logs, always use `table_state_type` for one state and
  `table_state_types` for lists.
- For Sentry, wrap sensitive API route groups with the sensitive Sentry scope
  marker and scrub request/response body capture from marked events. Do not
  duplicate route sensitivity with separate path matchers in the scrubber.

## Testing
- Tests run via `cargo-nextest` (process-per-test). Use `cargo xtask nextest run` for the full sharded suite, or `cargo nextest run` for single-crate runs.
- Integration tests are consolidated into `tests/main.rs` per crate. Address individual modules with `-- module_name::`.
- Doctests use `cargo test --doc` (nextest does not support them).
- If test output shows `0 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; n filtered out`, treat that as a failure to run tests.
- Verify that expected tests actually ran, not just that Cargo exited successfully.
- Prefer running `cargo nextest list` before using filters or crate-specific commands if there is any doubt.
- When fixing a specific crate, run the narrowest relevant tests first, then broaden if needed.
- When a test failure needs deeper debugging, rerun the targeted test with
  `ENABLE_TRACING=1`; set a focused `RUST_LOG` filter when needed, such as
  `RUST_LOG=etl::replication::apply=debug,etl_destinations::bigquery=debug`,
  to make the relevant pipeline or destination logs visible.
- Add or update tests when behavior changes, regressions are possible, or new logic is introduced.
- Prefer existing test utilities and fixtures over custom test plumbing. Before adding bespoke
  setup, waits, assertions, or database helpers, check nearby tests and `crates/etl/src/test_utils/` for
  an existing helper and reuse it when it fits.
- Register `NotifyingStore::notify_on_*` and `TestDestinationWrapper::wait_for_*` handles before the producer can fire. These helpers only arm on updates that arrive *after* registration, so register the notifier first, then start the producer.
- If your tests need `TESTS_DATABASE_HOST` to be set or a test instance of PostgreSQL you can use `cargo xtask postgres create` command to spawn a postgres instance

  ```rust
  let ready = store.notify_on_table_state_type(id, Ready).await;
  pipeline.start().await.unwrap();
  ready.notified().await;
  ```

### Integration Test Style
- Prefer one-way integration tests: perform the source-side writes first, wait for the expected notifications, then call `shutdown_and_wait()` immediately before assertions.
- Avoid asserting destination state while the pipeline is still running unless the test is specifically about in-flight behavior or recovery during active replication.
- For `TestDestinationWrapper`, prefer asserting against the cumulative event history from `get_events()`. Use `clear_events()` only when restarting the pipeline or when a test intentionally needs to discard earlier history and assert on a new phase in isolation.
- When asserting CDC event shapes, only expect combinations that PostgreSQL can actually emit for the table's replica identity mode. In particular, distinguish between `FULL`, primary-key identity, and `USING INDEX`, and remember that partial update rows only occur for update new-tuples.
