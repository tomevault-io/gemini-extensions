# PSF Guard contributor guide

This is the canonical guide for people and coding agents working in this
repository. `AGENTS.md` is a symlink to this file so both entry points stay in
sync.

## Writing

- Use plain, direct English.
- Cut words that do not add meaning.
- Prefer active voice.
- Keep technical terms when they improve accuracy.
- Update the nearest focused document instead of adding another root-level
  plan.

## Product

PSF Guard is an astrophotography catalog, grader, and quality-analysis tool. It
can build a catalog from FITS folders or open an existing N.I.N.A. Target
Scheduler database. The same Rust application runs as a CLI, an Axum server,
or a Tauri desktop app. A React frontend supplies the grader and management UI.

Main capabilities include:

- multi-database FITS catalog management;
- fast image review, comparison, grading, and export;
- star detection, PSF fitting, spatial screening, and photometry;
- pixel-derived astrometry, sky overlays, and satellite prediction;
- calibrated mono stacks and RGB, LRGB, or narrowband previews;
- header-first imports, background quality backfill, and safe database sync;
- reversible reject archives and remote image intake.

## Toolchain and common commands

The repository uses the Rust toolchain pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml`, Rust
2024, Node 24 in CI, and Tauri 2.

```bash
# Rust checks used by CI
cargo fmt -- --check
cargo build
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo test

# Frontend checks
cd static
npm ci
npm run lint
npx vitest run
npm run build

# Browser end-to-end tests; requires a built psf-guard binary
npx playwright test

# Run the server or desktop app
cargo run -- server db.sqlite /path/to/images
cargo tauri dev

# Build release forms
cargo build --release
cargo build --release --features tauri
cargo tauri build
```

Use `--registry /tmp/psf-guard-test.json` for ad-hoc server work that must not
touch the user's real database registry. Do not run import, sync, catalog
installation, quality scans, or database-management actions against a live
catalog unless the task grants that access.

The server caches `notice.json` for 24 hours for both browser and Tauri modes;
UI reloads read `/api/update-notice` and never fetch the public feeds. Only
Tauri loads the signed updater plugin. Both feeds try `updates.psf-guard.com`
before the GitHub release fallback. See [docs/UPDATES.md](docs/UPDATES.md).

## Core invariants

### Databases and grading

- Treat Target Scheduler compatibility as a public contract. Probe optional
  columns and tolerate supported schema differences.
- Target Scheduler stores right ascension in decimal hours. Convert it to ICRS
  degrees at the astrometry boundary.
- `gradingStatus` values are `0 = Pending`, `1 = Accepted`, and `2 = Rejected`.
  Keep `rejectreason` consistent with the grade.
- Match records across databases by stable GUID. Do not substitute names or
  nearby coordinates for sync identity.
- Open a source database read-only during sync. Refuse the same source and
  destination path. Preview every UI transfer before Apply.
- The Overview merges databases, but Grid, Detail, Comparison, and Sequence
  routes must keep the `db` slug in URL state. The Overview carries the same
  scope so it can mark where the user was and hand it back, so anything that
  scopes to one database must read `useScopedDbId` and ignore the slug there.

Design records: [multi-database](docs/design/multi-database.md),
[data transfer](docs/design/data-transfer.md), and
[reject archive](docs/design/reject-archive.md).

### Image evidence and grading

- Keep catalog predictions separate from pixel evidence. A FITS header, target
  coordinate, or satellite ephemeris does not prove that the pixels match.
- Quality grading must renormalize when evidence is missing. Do not punish an
  image because an optional scan has not run.
- Only fresh pixel-derived solves support astrometry grading. Embedded WCS can
  support display but does not prove the current pixels.
- A lone no-solve is advisory. Automatic rejection needs corroborating
  pointing, cloud, obstruction, or tracking evidence.
- Cross-frame background and flux comparisons must use physical ADU, not the
  per-frame normalized storage values. A PixInsight XISF frame declaring
  `bounds="0:1"` has no ADU of its own; `src/image_io.rs` puts it on a 16-bit
  scale on the way in, so read every frame through there rather than reaching
  for `seiza_xisf` or `seiza_stacking::FitsFrame::open` directly.
- N.I.N.A. Fast supplies comparable star count and HFR values for imported
  catalogs. HocusFocus remains available for deeper analysis.

Current behavior: [quality screening](docs/SCREENING.md),
[astrometry grading](docs/ASTROMETRY_QUALITY.md), and
[statistical grading](docs/STATISTICAL_GRADING.md).

### Seiza and image processing

- PSF Guard consumes published Seiza crates. Do not copy Seiza algorithms into
  this repository when the crate owns them.
- `seiza-imgproc` replaces OpenCV. Its numeric behavior affects detector
  thresholds and star counts; validate changes on real frames as well as unit
  fixtures.
- Keep the order-sensitive HocusFocus reductions serial unless real-frame
  parity proves a replacement safe.
- Satellite element fetches belong to explicit user actions. Read-only sequence
  requests and ordinary regrading use cached elements.
- Keep satellite predictions labeled as predictions. Use
  `seiza_satellites::trail_alignment` for pixel evidence.

Current behavior: [satellites](docs/SATELLITES.md) and
[stack previews](docs/STACKING_PREVIEWS.md).

### Jobs, caches, and concurrency

- Scope derived artifacts below the database slug. Cache keys must include the
  source fingerprint and every algorithm or catalog input that can change the
  result.
- Write generated artifacts to a temporary file and rename them atomically.
- Preview requests return `202` while queued work runs. Keep generation out of
  the HTTP request path.
- Size CPU pools through `src/concurrency.rs`; do not add fixed worker counts.
- Interactive work wins over background pre-generation and quality backfill.
- Keep the shared request database connection free of slow refresh work.
- A stale directory tree may be served while one background refresh runs. Do
  not make every request rescan storage.

### Imports, files, and calibration

- A frame is a FITS or an XISF file. Detect one with `src/image_io.rs` and read
  one through it; do not test extensions or call `seiza_fits` directly at a new
  site. Both containers decode to the same `seiza_fits::FitsImage`.
- Initial import is header-first. Expensive star, photometry, spatial, and
  astrometry work belongs to the background quality job.
- Import creates Target Scheduler-compatible lights and PSF Guard-owned
  calibration records. Never put calibration frames in `acquiredimage`.
- Preserve raw FITS files. Forgetting a calibration record must not delete its
  source file.
- Invalidate generated masters transitively when an input frame or upstream
  master changes.
- File moves must support a dry run, avoid overwrites, and retain enough state
  for recovery. `move-rejects` and `restore-rejects` follow this rule.

Current behavior: [importing](docs/IMPORTING.md) and
[calibration libraries](docs/CALIBRATION_LIBRARY.md).

## Frontend rules

- Keep project and database scope in URL state so reload, navigation, and
  shared links restore the same view.
- Preserve scroll position while previews load, cache status changes, or data
  refreshes.
- Grid and Sequence share arrow-key navigation and Space selection.
- Image zoom state is calibrated against the bitmap dimensions recorded by the
  zoom hook. Report every loaded bitmap before constraining pan or scale.
- Use the shared async preview poller; do not add one timer per image.
- Database mutations and catalog installation must remain behind the Tauri or
  server database-management gate.

## Change workflow

1. Read the focused document and nearby tests before editing.
2. Preserve unrelated worktree changes. Use a new worktree for a separate PR.
3. Add or update a regression test for changed behavior.
4. Run the narrow checks while iterating, then the relevant Rust, frontend, and
   browser layers before handoff.
5. Run `git diff --check` and review the final diff for stale links, generated
   files, and unrelated changes.
6. Add a line to `docs/releases/unreleased.md` when the change is visible to a
   user. Describe the behavior they get, not the commit. Skip it for internal
   refactors, test-only work, and dependency bumps.
7. For a PR, state exactly which checks ran. Do not treat hosted CI as a local
   test result.

## Documentation

Start at [docs/README.md](docs/README.md). Keep current behavior in the focused
user or engineering guide. Keep only architecture records that still explain a
live contract under `docs/design/`. Delete completed implementation plans once
tests and current docs cover them.
