# GitHub Copilot Custom Instructions for `hass-diagral`

## Project Context

- **Project Type:**  
  This repository is a **custom integration for [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/)**, written in Python.
- **Purpose:**  
  The integration connects Home Assistant to the Diagral alarm system, exposing alarm states, sensors, and diagnostics, and providing Home Assistant entities, events, and configuration flows.
- **Structure:**  
  - All integration code is in `custom_components/diagral/`.
  - Documentation is in the `docs/` directory and `docs.json`.
  - The integration uses Home Assistant's config flow, entity platforms (`sensor`, `alarm_control_panel`), and `DataUpdateCoordinator` pattern.
  - The codebase follows Home Assistant's best practices for custom components.
- **Language:**  
  - All code, comments, and docstrings must be in **English** (even though the maintainer is French).
- **Documentation:**  
  - All files in `docs/` and `docs.json` are documentation and must use the `docs` commit type.
  - Documentation is in Markdown or MDX, and must be clear and concise.
  - All new entities must be documented in `docs/integration/entities.mdx`.
- **Testing:**  
  - Use `pytest` conventions for tests.
  - Tests live at `custom_components/diagral/tests/` (inside the devcontainer-mounted folder).
  - **Whenever any `custom_components/diagral/*.py` file is created or modified, immediately analyse the corresponding `tests/test_<module>.py` and CREATE, UPDATE, or DELETE tests as needed. Never skip this step silently.**
  - After writing or modifying tests, run the test suite (see Quick Start below for environment detection and the correct command).
- **Linting/Formatting:**  
  - Use `flake8` as the linter, with a maximum line length of 150 characters.
  - Run locally with: `flake8 --max-line-length=150 custom_components/diagral/`
  - You may also use `black` for formatting, but `flake8` is required for linting.

## Quick Start — Key Commands

```bash
# Lint
flake8 --max-line-length=150 custom_components/diagral/

# Tests — environment-aware (see tests.instructions.md for full details)
# 1. Check if inside devcontainer:
test -d /workspaces && echo "inside" || echo "outside"
# 2a. Inside devcontainer:
#   cd /workspaces/home-assistant-dev/config/custom_components/diagral && pytest tests/ -v
# 2b. Outside devcontainer — list containers, then:
#   docker ps --format "table {{.ID}}\t{{.Image}}\t{{.Names}}"
#   docker exec -w /workspaces/home-assistant-dev/config/custom_components/diagral <ID> pytest tests/ -v

# CI validation (run by GitHub Actions — not local)
# hassfest  →  validates manifest.json, translations, quality_scale.yaml
# hacs/action  →  validates HACS compatibility
```

> **No Makefile** — there is no automated local build script. Use the commands above directly.
> A `pyproject.toml` lives at `custom_components/diagral/pyproject.toml` for pytest configuration (mounted into the devcontainer).

## Architecture

```
custom_components/diagral/
├── __init__.py          # Integration setup/teardown, webhook registration
├── coordinator.py       # DiagralDataUpdateCoordinator (polls every 300 s)
├── models.py            # DiagralData, DiagralConfigData, DiagralOptionsData
├── const.py             # All constants (DOMAIN, services, default values)
├── config_flow.py       # UI config flow + options flow
├── entity.py            # Base entity class (DiagralEntity)
├── alarm_control_panel.py  # AlarmControlPanel platform
├── sensor.py            # Sensor platform
├── webhook.py           # Webhook handler (push updates from Diagral cloud)
├── diagnostics.py       # HA diagnostics endpoint
├── services.yaml        # Custom service definitions
├── manifest.json        # Integration metadata (pydiagral==1.6.0)
└── translations/        # en.json, fr.json
```

**Key patterns:**
- `DiagralConfigEntry = ConfigEntry[DiagralData]` — typed config entry shorthand.
- `DiagralDataUpdateCoordinator` fetches: `alarm_config`, `devices_infos`, `groups`, `system_status`, `anomalies`.
- Webhook supports both **Nabu Casa cloud** (`.nabu.casa` domain) and direct HA webhook.
- All coordinator data comes from **`pydiagral`** (the external library wrapping the Diagral API).

**External dependency:** `pydiagral==1.6.0` (pinned). All Diagral API calls go through this library.

## CI/CD

| Workflow | Trigger | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `home-assistant.yaml` | push / PR | `hassfest` + HACS validation |
| `release.yaml` | tag push | `semantic-release` (Node.js-based) |
| `codeql.yaml` | weekly + push | CodeQL security analysis (Python) |
| `devsec.yaml` | `dev` branch / PR to `dev` | FortiDevSec SAST scan |

**Branch strategy:** `dev` is the integration/development branch. `main` is stable (releases). All PRs must target `dev`.

## External Context and Libraries

- You may use context7 for code generation and suggestions.
- You are allowed to use libraries and APIs from:
  - `/home-assistant/core`
  - [developers.home-assistant.io](https://developers.home-assistant.io)
- Use these resources to ensure compatibility and best practices with Home Assistant integrations.

## Pull Request Best Practices

- **Title:**
  - The PR title MUST follow the same format as the commit message guidelines (see below):
    `<type>[optional scope]: <gitmoji> <description>`
  - The title should summarize the main purpose of the PR.

- **Description:**
  - The PR description MUST provide a clear summary of all changes included in the PR.
  - List and briefly explain each commit included in the PR.
  - For each commit, include a direct link to the commit (e.g., `https://github.com/mguyard/hass-diagral/commit/<sha>`).
  - If the PR addresses or closes issues, reference them using GitHub keywords (e.g., `Closes #123`).
  - Use bullet points for clarity if needed.

- **Branch:**
  - All PRs MUST use `dev` as the base branch.

- **General:**
  - Ensure your PR is focused and does not mix unrelated changes.
  - Follow all other project and commit message guidelines described above.


## Commit Message Guidelines

- **Format:**  
  ```
  <type>[optional scope]: <gitmoji> <description>

  [optional body]
  ```
- **Types and Gitmoji:**  
  Use the following gitmoji for each commit type to ensure consistency:
  - `feat`: ✨ (sparkles) — For new features
  - `fix`: 🐛 (bug) — For bug fixes
  - `docs`: 📝 (memo) — For documentation changes (including anything in `docs/` or `docs.json`)
  - `refactor`: ♻️ (recycle) — For code refactoring that does not add features or fix bugs
  - `test`: ✅ (white check mark) — For adding or updating tests
  - `chore`: 🔧 (wrench) — For maintenance, build, or tooling changes

- **Examples:**
  ```
  feat(alarm_control_panel): ✨ Add support for partial arming mode

  * Implements `partial` arming for Diagral alarm.
  * Updates UI to reflect new mode.
  ```

  ```
  docs(readme): 📝 Update README with troubleshooting section

  * Adds common issues and solutions for Diagral integration.
  ```

  ```
  fix(sensor): 🐛 Fix humidity sensor value conversion
  ```

  ```
  refactor(coordinator): ♻️ Refactor update logic for better reliability
  ```

  ```
  test(alarm_control_panel): ✅ Add tests for alarm state transitions
  ```

  ```
  chore(deps): 🔧 Bump minimum Home Assistant version to 2024.6.0
  ```

- **Rules:**
  - Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.
  - Use backticks for code/entity references in the description.
  - Write the body in bullet points for clarity if needed.
  - Always write commit messages in English.

## Python-Specific Best Practices

- Use virtual environments for development.
- Use `async`/`await` for I/O-bound operations.
- Handle exceptions gracefully and log errors.
- Use `logging` instead of `print` for output.
- Prefer list comprehensions and generator expressions for concise code.
- Avoid global variables.
- Use constants for configuration values.

## Home Assistant Integration

- Follow [Home Assistant custom component guidelines](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/creating_component_index/).
- Entities should have unique IDs and meaningful names.
- Use translations for entity names and options.
- Ensure all entities are documented in `docs/integration/entities.mdx`.

## For Copilot Coding Agent

- When asked to create or modify files, always use English for code, comments, and docstrings.
- When generating documentation, use Markdown or MDX and English.
- When generating commit messages, follow the Conventional Commits and gitmoji rules above.
- When working with Home Assistant, prefer async APIs and follow the entity/component patterns in the codebase.
- All configuration, code, and documentation must be consistent with the existing project structure and standards.
- **After every code change in `custom_components/diagral/*.py`, analyse `tests/test_<module>.py` and CREATE, UPDATE, or DELETE tests as needed. Never skip this step.**
- **Enforce flake8 linting with a max line length of 150 characters.**
- The `tests/` directory lives at `custom_components/diagral/tests/`. Create it with `__init__.py` and `conftest.py` when writing the first test.
- To run tests: detect the environment first (`test -d /workspaces`). If inside devcontainer run `pytest tests/ -v` directly; otherwise run `docker ps` to list containers and ask the developer which container ID to use. If no container is running, ask the developer to start the devcontainer first.
- New entities need a unique ID, a translation key, and an entry in `docs/integration/entities.mdx`.
- All Diagral API calls must go through `pydiagral` — do not call the Diagral API directly.
- Use `DiagralConfigEntry` (typed alias) instead of raw `ConfigEntry` wherever possible.
