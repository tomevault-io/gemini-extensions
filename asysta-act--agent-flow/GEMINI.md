# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What This Is

A Claude Code plugin (`agent-flow`) that automates bug-fix workflows, feature implementation, and project scaffolding. It provides specialized agents that are orchestrated by commands to take an issue from triage through fix, review, test, and publish — or to scaffold a new project from scratch. The plugin is generic — all project-specific configuration lives in the consuming project's CLAUDE.md under `## Automation Config`.

**Author:** Filip Sabacky
**Installation:** `claude plugin marketplace add <path-to-repo>`, then `claude plugin install agent-flow@agent-flow`

## Repository Structure

No build system, no dependencies. Manual test suite in `tests/`. This is a pure plugin of markdown definitions.

- `.claude-plugin/` — Plugin metadata (`plugin.json`, `marketplace.json`)
- `agents/` — 17 agent definitions (markdown with YAML frontmatter)
- `skills/` — 17 skills (slash commands)
- `docs/guides/` — Installation and configuration guides
- `docs/reference/` — Command, agent, pipeline, and config reference
- `examples/` — Config templates, custom agent examples, MCP config examples
- `checklists/` — Pipeline phase checklists (review, test, publish)
- `tests/` — Test harness with scenarios and CI workflow
- `.agent-flow/` — Per-run pipeline state files (state.json, pipeline.log, browser artifacts)
- `state/` — State schema documentation
- `core/` — 17 shared pipeline pattern contracts

## Architecture: 2-Layer System

**Skills** (orchestration — WHAT to do): `/analyze-bug`, `/autopilot`, `/changelog`, `/check-setup`, `/create-backlog`, `/discuss`, `/fix-bugs`, `/implement-feature`, `/metrics`, `/onboard`, `/prioritize`, `/publish`, `/scaffold`, `/setup-agents`, `/setup-mcp`, `/sprint-plan`, `/version-check`
**Agents** (specialists — HOW to do it): acceptance-gate, analyst, architect, backlog-creator, browser-agent, deployment-verifier, fixer, priority-engine, publisher, reviewer, rollback-agent, scaffolder, spec-analyst, spec-reviewer, spec-writer, sprint-planner, test-engineer

Skills read `## Automation Config` from the project's CLAUDE.md and dispatch agents. Skills contain zero project-specific logic.

## Bug-Fix Pipeline

```
Issue tracker query → ANALYST --phase triage (sonnet, +AC extraction, +complexity, +reproduction_steps)
  → ANALYST --phase impact (sonnet) → [BROWSER-AGENT --phase reproduce (sonnet, optional)] → [Pre-fix hook]
  → FIXER ↔ REVIEWER (opus, +AC fulfillment check)
  → [Post-fix hook + custom agent] → [Smoke check (build + test)] → TEST-ENGINEER (sonnet)
  → [TEST-ENGINEER --e2e (sonnet, optional)] → [BROWSER-AGENT --phase verify (sonnet, optional)] → [Acceptance gate (conditional: AC ≥ 3 or complexity ≥ M)]
  → [Pre-publish hook + custom agent] → PUBLISHER (haiku)
```

Retry limits are configurable via `Retry Limits` section in Automation Config (defaults: 5 fixer iterations, 3 test attempts, 3 build retries, 5 spec iterations, 3 root cause iterations).

Each agent can **Block** the issue (set state, add comment using Block Comment Template, move on). On block from fixer/reviewer/test-engineer: **rollback-agent** reverts git state. Hooks and custom agents can be inserted at 4 points (see `skills/fix-bugs/SKILL.md` for full pipeline).

## Feature Pipeline

```
Issue tracker query → SPEC-ANALYST (sonnet, +AC writeback)
  → ARCHITECT (opus, +maps_to traceability)
  → [AC coverage check] → [Decomposition decision] → [Create tracker subtasks]
  → FIXER ↔ REVIEWER (opus, +AC fulfillment check)
  → [Smoke check (build + test)] → TEST-ENGINEER (sonnet) → [Acceptance gate (always in decomposition, skipped in single-pass)]
  → PUBLISHER (haiku)
```

## Scaffold Pipeline

```
[0-INFRA: infra declaration] → [0-MCP: MCP check]
  → User description → SPEC-WRITER ↔ SPEC-REVIEWER (opus)
  → [Spec checkpoint] → SCAFFOLDER (sonnet, +test infrastructure, +scorecard)
  → Validate → Git init → [4d: push] → [4e: tracker issues]
  → ARCHITECT (opus, +maps_to) → [Feature plan checkpoint]
  → FIXER ↔ REVIEWER (opus) → TEST-ENGINEER (sonnet)
  → [Spec compliance check (spec-reviewer --verify)]
  → TEST-ENGINEER --e2e (sonnet) → Final report
```

Pipeline mode is selected via a flag at invocation time:
- **default** — human-in-the-loop with review checkpoints after each major phase
- **`--yolo`** — automated run, all checkpoints skipped, pipeline runs to completion without pausing
- **`--step-mode`** — pause before every individual agent step for fine-grained control

With `--no-implement`: `[0-INFRA] → [0-MCP] → STACK-SELECTOR (sonnet) → SCAFFOLDER (sonnet) → Validate → Git init → [push if SC ready]` (skeleton only, no implementation).

In spec-first mode, the specification is saved as a `spec/` folder in the project root (spec/README.md, spec/architecture.md, spec/verification.md, spec/epics/*.md). This folder is the single source of truth for all downstream agents.

## Agent Definition Format

Every agent file in `agents/` follows this exact structure:

```markdown
---
name: agent-name
description: One-line description used by Claude Code's Task tool
model: sonnet | opus | haiku
style: Short communication style descriptor
---

You are a [Role] specializing in [domain].

## Goal
## Expertise
## Process (numbered steps)
## Output Contract (mandatory — structured output schema agents return)
## Step Completion Invariants (mandatory — fields the orchestrator MUST verify in state.json before considering the stage complete: `dispatched_at` non-null ISO 8601, `dispatch_witness` non-null 64-hex sha256, `tool_uses` ≥ 1, `status="completed"`. Failure → orchestrator returns BLOCKED with reason `completion_invariant_violated:<missing-field>`. Witness verified via `core/lib/stage-invariant.sh::check_dispatch_witness`.)
## Constraints (NEVER rules, limits, failure handling)
```

> **Reliability contract:** `## Step Completion Invariants` is a mandatory structured section in every `agents/*.md`. Custom agents that lack it will fail the harness scenario `tests/scenarios/step-completion-invariants-completeness.sh`. See `core/lib/stage-invariant.sh` for the runtime helper functions (`compute_dispatch_witness`, `check_dispatch_witness`, `emit_witness_audit`).

### Model Selection

| Model | Used For | Agents |
|-------|----------|--------|
| opus | Critical code changes, quality review, architecture, specification, prioritization | fixer, reviewer, architect, priority-engine, spec-writer, spec-reviewer |
| sonnet | Analysis, testing, triage, specification, scaffolding, AC verification, deployment, backlog creation, sprint planning | analyst, test-engineer (incl. `--e2e` flag), spec-analyst, scaffolder, acceptance-gate, browser-agent, deployment-verifier, backlog-creator, sprint-planner |
| haiku | Mechanical/template tasks | publisher, rollback-agent |

### Key Conventions Across All Agents

- Read-only agents (analyst, reviewer, spec-analyst, architect, priority-engine, spec-reviewer, acceptance-gate, backlog-creator, sprint-planner) NEVER modify code
- Execution agents (fixer, test-engineer, publisher, scaffolder, spec-writer, browser-agent, deployment-verifier) make changes
- Max retry limits: 3 for builds/test fixes, 5 for fixer↔reviewer iterations, 5 for spec iterations
- Failure strategy: Block the issue with a comment explaining why, then move on
- Fixer diffs should be ≤100 lines; analyst (--phase impact) reports ≤5 affected files
- Publisher never pushes to main/dev directly — always creates a PR
- PR descriptions always in English; use template from Automation Config
- analyst (--phase triage) output includes: acceptance criteria (2-5 items), complexity estimate (XS/S/M/L)
- Reviewer output includes: AC Fulfillment section (per-AC verdict: FULFILLED/PARTIALLY/NOT ADDRESSED) when AC are provided
- Acceptance-gate agent verifies AC fulfillment with code + test evidence (read-only, sonnet)
- Architect task tree includes: `maps_to` field linking subtasks to parent acceptance criteria (format: `AC-{N}: {text}`)
- Spec-analyst posts acceptance criteria as a separate comment to the issue tracker
- Spec-reviewer has a `--verify` mode for checking implementation against spec
- Fixer can signal NEEDS_DECOMPOSITION when scope exceeds limits (max 1 per ticket)

## Automation Config

Projects using this plugin must have `## Automation Config` in their CLAUDE.md with **18 optional config sections in total** (plus the required sections). All sections use table format (`| Key | Value |`); no bullet-point lists.

Stage names for skip: triage, analyst-impact, spec-analyst, test-engineer, test-engineer-e2e, browser-agent-reproduce, browser-agent-verify. Stages fixer, reviewer, publisher CANNOT be skipped.

### Metrics

Optional. Keys + defaults: Output (stdout), Period (30 days).

### Agent Overrides

Optional. Keys + default: Path (customization/). For each agent (e.g., `reviewer`, `fixer`, `test-engineer`), create a TOML file `{path}/{agent-name}.toml` with structured overlay configuration. Supports model/style scalar overrides, `[[process_additions]]` (step-specific instructions), `[[constraints]]` (additional rules), `[limits]` (numeric limits), and free-form `[meta]`. Contents are rendered and appended to the agent's prompt as `## Project-Specific Instructions`. Files that don't match any agent name are ignored. See `docs/guides/toml-overlay-syntax.md` for the full schema and `examples/agent-overrides/` for ready-to-use templates.

### Local Deployment

Optional. Keys: Type, Start command, Stop command, Health check URL, Health check timeout, Ports. Default (none).

### Sprint Planning

Optional. Keys + defaults: Sprint duration (2 weeks), Capacity unit (story-points), Team capacity (none), Velocity target (none), Sprint field (tracker-dependent), Mode (suggest), Max issues (20), Epic template (none).

### Autopilot

Optional. The `### Autopilot` section has exactly 7 keys. `Bug query` and `Feature query` are NOT Autopilot keys — they are read from `### Issue Tracker` and `### Feature Workflow` respectively.

| Key | Default | Purpose |
|-----|---------|---------|
| Max issues per run | 1 | Total cap per invocation (bugs + features combined) |
| Lock timeout | 120 | Stale lock threshold in minutes |
| Log file | .agent-flow/autopilot.log | Append-only run log path |
| Bug limit | 0 | Per-type bug cap (0 = no per-type cap) |
| Feature limit | 0 | Per-type feature cap (0 = no per-type cap) |
| On error | skip | `skip` = continue on error; `stop` = abort run on first error |
| Dry run | false | `true` = full short-circuit (no lock, no state, no dispatch) |

### Pause Limits

Optional section controlling how long a `paused` pipeline (awaiting NEEDS_CLARIFICATION clarification) is retained before autopilot considers it abandoned.

| Key | Default |
|-----|---------|
| Pause timeout | 30 days |

Valid range: min 1 hour, max 365 days. Invalid values fall back to the default (30 days) with a `[WARN]` log — the pipeline is NOT aborted on invalid input. See `skills/autopilot/SKILL.md` `parse_pause_timeout()` for validation logic.

## Webhook Payloads

Webhook payloads are forward-compatible — additive fields may be added in future MINOR versions without a schema version bump. Consumers MUST use lenient JSON parsing (ignore unknown fields). Existing payload fields (`pr-created`, `agent-flow-block`) are never renamed or removed. The events `pipeline-started`, `step-completed`, and `pipeline-completed` are supported. Webhook delivery failure is advisory — `[WARN] Webhook delivery failed` is logged and the pipeline continues.

**Operator trust required**: The `Webhook URL` value is dispatched via `curl` without scheme or host validation. Operators are responsible for configuring trusted URLs pointing to internal observability endpoints. SSRF defenses (e.g., restricting `file://`/`gopher://` schemes) are deferred to a future release. Per spec design §3.6.

**Known limitation — covert-channel DoS:** the `Webhook URL` value in Automation Config is dispatched via curl without scheme/host validation beyond `--proto "=http,https"`. A malicious PR that injects a slow-responding `Webhook URL` could trigger the circuit-breaker (3 consecutive failures, then suppression for the run). This is bounded but not zero-cost. **Operator guidance:** (a) treat CLAUDE.md `Webhook URL` PR changes as security-relevant, (b) defer setting `Webhook URL` in multi-contributor environments until cross-run circuit persistence + URL allowlist are available.

## Plugin Composability

agent-flow uses the `agent-flow:` namespace prefix on all skills. To ensure compatibility with other plugins:

- All skills are invoked as `/agent-flow:<skill>` (e.g., `/agent-flow:fix-bugs`)
- Custom agents should follow a similar namespace convention (e.g., `my-plugin:agent-name`)
- Run `/agent-flow:check-setup` to detect potential skill name conflicts with other installed plugins

## Block Comment Template

When an agent blocks an issue, skills instruct it to use this format:

```
[agent-flow] 🔴 Pipeline Block
Agent: {agent name}
Step: {pipeline step where failure occurred}
Reason: {max 2 sentences}
Detail: {technical output — error message, diff, test output}
Recommendation: {what the human should do}
```

Triage checkpoint comment format (after successful triage):

```
[agent-flow] Triage completed. Severity: {severity}. Area: {area}. Complexity: {complexity}. AC: {count}.
```

Both use `[agent-flow]` prefix for machine-parseable detection by entry-point skills (`/fix-bugs`, `/implement-feature`, `/scaffold`) which auto-resume paused pipelines.

## Versioning Policy

| Level | Trigger | Examples |
|-------|---------|---------|
| MAJOR (X.0.0) | Breaking change in Automation Config contract — new required key, renamed section — OR breaking change in agent output format contract (new/modified structured output sections that Agent Overrides or external tooling may parse) — OR introduction of a mandatory new structured contract section in agent definition files that prior-version agents would fail validation against | New required key in Issue Tracker; new output section in analyst; mandatory `## Output Contract` section |
| MINOR (X.Y.0) | New backward-compatible feature — new optional key, new command/agent | `/version-check`, optional Hooks section |
| PATCH (X.Y.Z) | Behavior fix without contract change | Agent text fix, command logic fix |

Key rule: Adding a **required** key to Automation Config = MAJOR. Adding an **optional** section = MINOR.

Adding new static declaration sections to agent definition files (`## Output Contract`, `## Inputs`, `## Outputs`, or similar metadata blocks) that are not enforced at runtime classifies as MINOR when the section is OPTIONAL (consuming-project agent files without it remain valid against the harness) and MAJOR when the section is MANDATORY (agent files without it fail at least one harness scenario). The override injector at `core/agent-override-injector.md` is structure-blind and is not "external tooling that parses" agent body sections — its append-only behavior does not fire the MAJOR clause on its own.

### Release Process

Releases are **PR-only**. NEVER commit a version bump, tag, or CHANGELOG edit directly to `main` — branch protection on `main` requires a PR with green CI.

**Version bump location.** A release bumps the `version` field in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` AND both `version` fields in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` (`metadata.version` and `plugins[0].version`), plus a dated `CHANGELOG.md` entry. These three move together in the same release.

**Single PR → release.** The feature/fix PR carries the bump + its CHANGELOG entry. After it merges to `main` with green CI, cut the release **on `main`**:

```bash
gh release create vX.Y.Z --target main --title "vX.Y.Z" --notes-file <notes>
```

`gh release create` creates the git tag AND the GitHub Release in one step — pushing a bare tag does NOT create a Release.

**Multiple PRs → one release.** When several open PRs should ship together, do NOT merge them to `main` one-by-one and do NOT integrate on `main`. Use a short-lived integration branch and **re-target the source PRs onto it** so each still records as merged:

1. Branch `release/vX.Y.Z` off `main` and push it to the base repo.
2. Re-point each source PR's base from `main` to `release/vX.Y.Z` (`gh pr edit <N> --base release/vX.Y.Z`), then squash-merge each into the integration branch through GitHub (`gh pr merge <N> --squash`). Each source PR then shows **merged** (not closed) and keeps its review/commit record. Fork PRs work the same way — the base branch lives in the base repo, so the maintainer merges them in. Resolve conflicts via the normal per-PR update against the integration branch.
3. On the integration branch, set the single version bump and a `CHANGELOG.md` `[X.Y.Z]` entry that covers **all** bundled PRs.
4. Open ONE PR: `release/vX.Y.Z` → `main` — the only PR that targets `main`. Green CI + review, then merge.
5. Cut the release on `main` as above.

`release/vX.Y.Z` is unprotected, so source PRs merge into it without the `main` status-check gate; that gate applies once, at step 4. (A bare local `git merge --squash` of a PR's content also works but leaves the source PR showing "closed" rather than "merged" — prefer the re-target flow so the merge history stays explicit.)

**Bundled version = the highest individual classification.** Classify each bundled PR against the Versioning Policy table, then the release takes the max: any MAJOR → MAJOR; else any MINOR → MINOR; else PATCH. Prefer keeping individual source PRs version-neutral (no `plugin.json` / `marketplace.json` / `CHANGELOG` edits) so bumps never compete or conflict; finalize the single bump + the combined CHANGELOG entry on the integration branch. If one source PR already carries the bump, ensure the others do not and reconcile the CHANGELOG on the integration branch.

## Cross-File Invariants

The following invariants MUST hold across release commits. Phase 8 verification scenarios assert each:

1. **License SPDX consistency** — `.claude-plugin/plugin.json:license`, `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json:plugins[0].license`, and the first heading of `LICENSE` MUST all reference the exact string `"MIT"` (canonical SPDX form, case-sensitive).
2. **Maintainer email consistency** — `SECURITY.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, and `CONTRIBUTING.md` MUST all reference `filip.sabacky@ceosdata.com` as the maintainer contact (no other emails for this role).
3. **Issue/PR template parity** — `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md`, `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md`, and `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` MUST follow the canonical template structure. The public release supports GitHub only; `.gitea/` mirrors are not maintained.

Doc-count drift discipline: when adding or removing a skill, agent, optional config section, or core contract, the corresponding count fields in CLAUDE.md, README.md, docs/reference/automation-config.md, docs/reference/skills.md, and docs/architecture.md must be updated together in the same commit.

## When Editing Agent Definitions

- Preserve the frontmatter format exactly (name, description, model, style)
- Keep the Goal → Expertise → Process → Output Contract → Step Completion Invariants → Constraints section order
- Process steps must be numbered and actionable
- Constraints must start with NEVER or define hard limits
- The `description` field in frontmatter is what appears in Claude Code's agent picker — keep it concise and descriptive
