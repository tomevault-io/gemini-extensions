Orientation for AI coding agents (and humans) modifying this repo. Skim

## What this is

The repo ships a family of GenAI add-ons for [Apache KIE](https://kie.apache.org/),
targeting its Kogito cloud-native runtime. Today there's one add-on — the **Ad-Hoc Subprocess**
orchestrator — that lets an LLM drive a BPMN ad-hoc subprocess: pick the
next task, write a prompt, parse structured output, write results back to
process variables, and signal completion.

Multi-runtime is core to the design: the same orchestrator runs on
**Quarkus** (LangChain4j) and **Spring Boot** (Spring AI). The core
module is framework-agnostic.

## Module layout (one rule)

Every artifact follows the same prefix. Once you know the rule, the
layout is predictable:

```
groupId:    ai.aletyx.kogito
artifactId: aletyx-kogito-ai-{addons-{runtime}-?}{role}{-suffix?}
package:    ai.aletyx.kogito.addons.{adhocsubprocess|quarkus|springboot}.…
```

`addons-{runtime}-` infix appears only on runtime-specific modules.
The framework-agnostic core and the framework-agnostic JPA piece don't
carry it (matches Apache Kogito's `kogito-addons-quarkus-*` convention).

## Architecture in 5 bullets

- **Core is plain Java.** No `@ApplicationScoped`, no `@Component`. The
  runtime addons construct core classes via their respective producers.
  Don't add CDI / Spring annotations to anything in
  `aletyx-kogito-ai-adhoc-subprocess`.
- **Two SPIs gate the boundaries.** `LLMProvider` is the single
  LLM abstraction (one bean, three methods: `selectTasks`,
  `formulatePrompt`, `executeTask`). `AIContextRepository` is the storage
  abstraction. Consumers can swap either by registering their own bean.
- **Three-pass orchestration.** Selection → formulation → execution.
  Each call has a narrow goal; we don't ask the LLM to "do everything"
  in one prompt. See `AIIntelligence`.
- **Phase state machine.** `PRE_HUMAN → AI_PROCESSING → POST_HUMAN →
  COMPLETED`, terminal at `COMPLETED`. Mutate via
  `AIContext.transitionTo(Phase)`, never via `setCurrentPhase` (that
  exists only for repository round-trips).
- **The orchestrator never embeds an HTTP client.** Provider-specific
  bits (LangChain4j, Spring AI) live in the runtime add-ons under
  `…/llm/`. Don't reach for an SDK from the core module.

## Decisions worth knowing

- **Per-runtime tools are intentional.** LangChain4j `@Tool` (Quarkus)
  and Spring AI `@Tool` (Spring Boot) aren't unified behind a portability
  layer. The cost — duplicating tool annotations when migrating runtimes
  — is acknowledged. Don't propose a tool-abstraction layer; it's been
  considered and rejected.
- **We use plain LangChain4j, not the Quarkus extension.**
  `quarkus-langchain4j` brings a REST client stack that conflicts with
  our resteasy setup. The producer in `LLMProviderProducer` builds
  `AnthropicChatModel` / `OpenAiChatModel` / `OllamaChatModel` directly.
- **`max_completion_tokens` not `max_tokens`** for OpenAI. Older models
  accept both; gpt-5.x and o-family reject `max_tokens`. We always send
  the new form.
- **kie-flyway, not the runtime's default Flyway.** Migrations ship in
  the storage add-on jar at
  `kie-flyway/db/aletyx-kogito-ai-adhoc-subprocess/`. On Quarkus this
  needs `quarkus.flyway.migrate-at-start=false` and `kie.flyway.enabled=true`
  to avoid two runners fighting.
- **`ResourceLoader.load()` caches.** Skill / BPMN / task schemas are
  immutable per JVM, and we read each on every evaluation tick. The
  cache is intentional. JVM restart is the only invalidation path
  (a `clearCache()` test hook exists, but production code shouldn't
  call it).
- **Startup validator fails fast.** A typo in the provider name or a
  missing API key fails the application boot via
  `LLMProviderValidator.validate()` — not the first chat call. See
  `LLMProviderStartupValidator` in each runtime addon.
- **REST endpoints are opt-out**, not opt-in. The
  `/api/ai-history/*` controllers register by default and can be
  disabled via `aletyx.kogito.ai.adhocsubprocess.history-api.enabled=false`.

## Property + table conventions

```
property prefix: aletyx.kogito.ai.adhocsubprocess.…
table prefix:    aletyx_kogito_ai_…
```

Both runtimes share the same property tree — consumers pin keys once
and switching runtimes doesn't move them. JPA tables are prefixed
`aletyx_kogito_ai_` to scope the schema and avoid collision with Apache
Kogito's `kogito_*` tables.

## Things to avoid

- **Don't `setCurrentPhase()` from runtime code.** Use `transitionTo()`.
  The setter is repository-restoration-only and bypasses logging + the
  terminal-state guard.
- **Don't fail silently on missing required resources.** The pattern is
  `ResourceLoader.requireExists(path, description)` at process init →
  loud `IllegalStateException` with the path in the message. Following
  through saves users hours of debugging "why does the AI behave weirdly".
- **Don't read process variables directly off the work item.** Go through
  `AIContext.getInitialProcessVars()` for the snapshot taken at process
  init, or through Kogito's process-variables API for current values.
  The orchestrator threads care about the distinction.
- **Don't introduce abstractions until a third caller appears.** Two
  similar pieces of code don't justify a shared interface. Three do.
- **Don't add fallback handling for invariants the code guarantees.**
  Validate at boundaries (LLM responses, BPMN inputs, REST payloads),
  not internally.
- **Don't reach across runtime boundaries.** A class under
  `…springboot.…` should never `import …quarkus.…` and vice versa.
  Shared logic lives in the core module.

## Conventions enforced by review (not tooling)

- Apache 2.0 license header at the top of every Java file. Match the
  existing format.
- SLF4J for logging. Prefix orchestration messages with `[AI]` and
  provider-side calls with `[LLM]`.
- Per-instance log lines include the process instance id in brackets:
  `[AI] [pid-XXX] …`. Use `processInstanceId` directly, not MDC, for
  predictability across async boundaries.
- Tests use JUnit 5 + AssertJ. Mocks of `LLMProvider` go in test
  sources as inline classes; we don't ship a mock module.
- Comments document the *why*, not the *what*. If a reader needs the
  comment to understand what the code does, the code is unclear.

## Build commands

Use the bundled Maven Wrapper (`./mvnw`) — it pins the Maven version
in the repo so the build is reproducible regardless of what's installed
on the runner.

```bash
./mvnw install                                   # full reactor + tests
./mvnw -DskipTests install                       # build artifacts only
./mvnw test -pl <module>                         # one module's tests
cd examples/quarkus    && ./mvnw test            # @QuarkusTest E2E (stubbed LLM)
cd examples/springboot && ./mvnw test            # @SpringBootTest E2E (stubbed LLM)
```

CI runs the same commands on every PR. Stubbed LLM only — no API keys
in CI, no surprise bills.
