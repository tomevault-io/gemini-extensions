13. That I've implemented immediate visual feedback for all user interactions, especially for processes that take time (loading states, progress indicators, success/error messages)
14. That I've accurately implemented Figma designs with proper design tokens, spacing, typography, and component structure

# Tailwind CSS v4 Implementation

## Setup and Configuration

- I MUST understand that Tailwind CSS v4 uses the @theme directive in CSS to define theme variables, rather than configuration in JavaScript/TypeScript files.
- I MUST ensure that project has the correct dependencies:
  - tailwindcss (the core package)
  - @tailwindcss/postcss (for PostCSS integration)
  - postcss
- I MUST check that the CSS file imports Tailwind correctly using `@import "tailwindcss";` at the top of the main CSS file.
- I MUST confirm the postcss.config.mjs file includes `"@tailwindcss/postcss": {}` in its plugins.
- I MUST NEVER modify the compiled CSS output directly.

## Theme Variables and the @theme Directive

- I MUST define all design tokens using the @theme directive in the CSS file:
  ```css
  @import 'tailwindcss';
  @theme {
    --color-brand-primary: #3b82f6;
    --color-brand-secondary: #1e40af;
    /* Add all other design tokens here */
  }
  ```
- I MUST understand that theme variables are special CSS variables with these properties:
  - They MUST be defined at the top level (not nested inside other selectors)
  - They generate corresponding utility classes automatically (e.g., `--color-mint-500` creates `bg-mint-500`, `text-mint-500`, etc.)
  - They are also available as regular CSS variables for use in arbitrary values
- I MUST follow these variable naming conventions to map to the correct utility classes:
  - `--color-*`: Creates text, background, border, and other color utilities
  - `--font-*`: Creates font-family utilities
  - `--breakpoint-*`: Creates responsive variants (e.g., `--breakpoint-3xl: 120rem;` creates the `3xl:` breakpoint)
  - And other namespaces as defined in the Tailwind CSS documentation

## @theme vs. :root Variables

- I MUST use @theme for variables that should generate utility classes (design tokens)
- I SHOULD use regular :root CSS variables for values that don't need corresponding utility classes
- I MUST understand that @theme variables automatically create CSS variables that can be used with var() syntax

# User Experience and Accessibility (UX & a11y)

## Responsive Design & UI

- I MUST build responsive interfaces that work across modern browsers and devices.
- I MUST use Tailwind CSS v4 for consistent spacing and responsive layouts.
- I MUST ensure interactive elements are easily tappable on mobile (minimum 44x44px touch targets) and keyboard-navigable on desktop.
- I MUST provide visual feedback for user actions (loading states, disabled buttons, toast notifications).
- I MUST implement immediate visual feedback for ALL user interactions:
  - Show loading spinners/skeletons for ANY process that takes longer than 300ms
  - Display progress bars with percentage indicators for uploads and longer operations
  - Provide estimated time remaining for lengthy processes when possible
  - Disable interactive elements while actions are processing to prevent duplicate submissions
  - Animate transitions between loading and result states for a smoother experience
  - Use distinct visual cues for success, error, and in-progress states

## Accessibility Best Practices

- I MUST write semantic HTML with proper ARIA roles/attributes only when needed.
- I MUST use `<button>` for clickable actions, never `<div>`s; and MUST use `<form>` with `<label>` for inputs.
- I MUST include descriptive alt text on images and MUST use Next's Image component for optimization.
- I MUST implement focus management (logical tab order, focus trapping in modals, focus return).
- I MUST meet WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines for color contrast, text scaling, and keyboard navigation.
- I SHOULD configure eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y and run automated tests with axe-core.

## State Management & Navigation

- I MUST provide consistent UI with reusable styled components for common patterns.
- I MUST use URL state for all important UI states to enable deep linking and browser history.
- I MUST preserve form input on navigation and use HTML5 validation for instant feedback.
- I SHOULD leverage Next.js Route Announcements for screen reader navigation.

# Code Structure and Organization

## File Organization

- I MUST organize the code EXACTLY like this:
  - `/src/app`: Contains the application routes and page components using Next.js App Router
    - `/dashboard`: Main user area after authentication
    - `/auth`, `/login`, `/signup`: Authentication-related pages
    - `/api`: Server-side API endpoints
  - `/src/components`: Reusable UI components
    - `/dashboard`: Dashboard-specific components
    - `/ui`: UI components for consistent design
    - `/shared`: Common components used across the application
  - `/src/lib`: Core utilities and services
    - `/supabase`: Supabase client configuration and helpers
    - `/utils`: General utility functions
  - `/src/hooks/*`: Custom hooks for stateful logic and business rules
  - `/src/services/*`: API calls, data processing, and external service integration
  - `/src/types/*`: TypeScript type definitions
  - `/src/contexts/*`: React Context definitions for global state
  - `/supabase`: Supabase configuration files
    - `/migrations`: Database migrations
    - `/functions`: Edge and database functions

## Component Architecture and Organization

- I MUST organize components hierarchically with clear responsibilities:

  - Every component MUST have a single, clearly defined responsibility
  - Every page component MUST have a singular purpose corresponding to a specific user flow or application state
  - Page components (in page.tsx files) MUST be minimal and primarily focused on composition
  - Page components MUST NOT contain implementation details ("meat") but rather delegate to section components
  - Page components MUST be limited to layout, data fetching coordination, and section composition (50-100 lines maximum)
  - Each logical section of a page MUST be its own component (e.g., Header, Hero, Features, Testimonials, Footer)
  - Each section component MUST be further broken down into smaller, focused subcomponents
  - Section components MUST be in their own files in an organized directory structure

- I MUST follow these strict size and complexity limits:

  - Components MUST be kept under 200 lines of code (including imports and exports)
  - Component sections larger than 30 lines MUST be extracted into subcomponents
  - Components exceeding 150 lines MUST be split into smaller components
  - Components with too many props (>7) MUST be split or use composition
  - Component nesting MUST be limited to 3 levels maximum to prevent prop drilling

- I MUST organize related components hierarchically in dedicated directories:

  - Components MUST be organized reflecting their hierarchical relationship
  - For example: `/components/dashboard/ActivityFeed/ActivityItem.tsx`
  - Section components MUST be in their own directories with related subcomponents
  - Closely related components MUST be grouped in the same directory
  - Complex features (like a dashboard) MUST have their own directory containing all their specific components

- I MUST rigorously apply the "Single Responsibility Principle":

  - Each component MUST do exactly one thing and do it well
  - I MUST extract any code that handles a distinct visual or functional concern into its own component
  - I MUST create dedicated components for repeated patterns even if they appear only twice
  - I MUST NOT combine multiple logical phases of a workflow (like upload and results display) in a single page component

- I MUST ensure all components have clear interfaces:

  - Props MUST be well-defined with specific types and purpose
  - Props MUST be documented with JSDoc comments for non-obvious usage
  - Components MUST explicitly declare all dependencies they need to function

- I MUST follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles rigorously by:

  - Creating reusable components for UI patterns that appear multiple times
  - Extracting repeated logic into custom hooks
  - Using utility functions for common operations
  - Leveraging higher-order components and render props when appropriate
  - Creating shared configuration constants instead of hardcoding the same values

- I MUST create separate component files for UI sections that:

  - Have their own state
  - Are reused in multiple places
  - Contain more than 50 lines of code

- I MUST use React Context for state shared across multiple components in different branches

- I MUST prefer composition over inheritance or complex nesting

## Separation of Concerns

- UI Components MUST:

  - Focus exclusively on rendering and user interaction
  - Use props for data and callbacks for events
  - Avoid containing business logic
  - Be written with mobile-first responsive design

- Custom Hooks MUST:

  - Encapsulate all state management
  - Handle complex business logic
  - Manage side effects
  - Be well-typed with TypeScript
  - Be unit-testable in isolation

- Service functions MUST:

  - Handle all external API calls
  - Manage data transformation
  - Encapsulate database operations
  - Use proper error handling

- Utility functions MUST:
  - Be pure functions without side effects
  - Have clear input/output contracts
  - Be unit-testable in isolation
  - Reside in appropriate utility files

## Prohibited Practices

- I MUST NEVER include in UI component files:

  - Direct API calls (use service files)
  - Complex state management logic (use custom hooks)
  - Utility functions (use utility files)
  - Database operations (use service files)
  - Media processing logic (use utility files)

- I MUST NEVER define:
  - Functions inside render methods that could be defined at module level
  - Complex event handlers (>10 lines) within components (move to hooks)
  - Anonymous functions with complex logic in JSX
  - Large, monolithic components (>200 lines)
  - Duplicate code that violates DRY principles, including:
    - Copy-pasted functions or components with minor variations
    - Repeated conditional logic that could be abstracted
    - Multiple implementations of the same business logic
    - Hardcoded values that should be constants or configuration
    - Redundant type definitions or interfaces

# Documentation Expectations

- I MUST add JSDoc comments for exported functions and types
- I MUST include brief explanations for complex logic
- I MUST document expected behaviors and edge cases in test files
- I MUST clearly mark expected errors in comments for error-triggering tests

# Type Safety with TypeScript

- I MUST write the entire application in TypeScript with strict mode enabled in tsconfig.json.
- I MUST NEVER use `any`; I MUST use `unknown` or generics for complex types instead.
- I MUST create interfaces and types for all data models (e.g., Profile for user data).
- I MUST use explicit type annotations for function parameters and return values.
- I MUST integrate Supabase's type generation using the CLI when needed.
- I MUST parameterize the Supabase client with database types: `createClient<Database>(url, anonKey)`.
- I MUST use explicit typing for React components: `function MyComponent({ user }: { user: Profile })`.
- I MUST use zod schemas for runtime validation and inference with `z.infer<typeof schema>`.
- I SHOULD configure TS lint rules to disallow implicit any and catch type errors early.
- I MUST regenerate types when the database schema changes to catch impacted code.

# Supabase Types and API Definitions

- I MUST ALWAYS use Supabase's generated types for complete type safety when interacting with the database.
- I MUST NEVER directly modify the database.types.ts file because it is autogenerated.
- I MUST parameterize all Supabase client instances with the Database type: `createClient<Database>(url, anonKey)`.
- This ensures that database operations are fully typed:
  - `select()` calls return properly typed data with exact columns and types
  - `insert()` and `update()` operations validate correct fields at compile time
  - `filter()` operations check for valid column names
- When database schema changes occur:
  - I MUST regenerate types immediately with the Supabase CLI
  - I MUST let TypeScript identify all impacted code that needs updating
  - I MUST fix type errors before deploying to prevent runtime issues
- I MUST NEVER use untyped database access; I MUST ALWAYS leverage the generated types to catch errors during development.
- I MUST create type-safe wrapper functions for complex queries that use the generated types.

# Supabase Setup and Security

- Database setup includes customers and subscriptions tables for Paddle integration
- Migration files are stored in supabase/migrations/
- To run migrations: `supabase db push`
- Local development server runs on port 3000 (http://localhost:3000)
- I MUST NEVER modify the database directly. I MUST ALWAYS create migrations.

## Security - Least Privilege Principle

- I MUST use the anon key for public client calls and restrict its rights via RLS policies.
- I MUST NEVER expose the service_role key in client-side code (it bypasses all security).
- I MUST perform privileged operations through server-side functions (Next.js API routes or Edge Functions).
- I MUST validate that the requester is authorized before performing privileged operations.
- I MUST store sensitive config in Next.js environment variables.
- I MUST use the NEXT*PUBLIC* prefix ONLY for values safe to expose (anon key and URL).
- I MUST apply Row Level Security (RLS) policies for ALL tables.
- I SHOULD create secure views or Postgres functions for complex security checks.
- I MUST set appropriate policies for Supabase Storage buckets.
- I MUST NEVER leave any table or storage bucket open by default.

## Storage Configuration

- Storage bucket: 'media' (private bucket)
- Image access requires signed URLs since the bucket is private

## Working with Aggregate Functions

- I MUST use SQL aggregate functions (sum, count, avg) in the database, not client-side calculations
- I MUST use proper column.function() syntax: `column_name.sum()`, `id.count()`, etc.
- I MUST combine multiple aggregations in a single query to reduce database round-trips
- I MUST handle aggregate function results appropriately:

  ```javascript
  // For a query like this:
  .select('id.count(), amount.sum(), rating.avg()')

  // Results will have this structure:
  {
    count: 42,  // NOT id or id_count
    sum: 1500,  // NOT amount or amount_sum
    avg: 4.7    // NOT rating or rating_avg
  }
  ```

- I MUST add explicit type handling for aggregate results since they may be null if no rows match

## Using the mcp_supabase_query Tool

- I MUST use it ONLY for READ operations (SELECT queries) to inspect the database
- Before writing database-related code, I SHOULD run schema inspection queries:
  ```sql
  SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'public';
  ```
  ```sql
  SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable FROM information_schema.columns
  WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_name = '[TABLE_NAME]';
  ```
- For testing modifications, I MUST use transactions with ROLLBACK:
  ```sql
  BEGIN;
  -- Your test query here
  ROLLBACK;
  ```
- I MUST NEVER use the tool for INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, ALTER, CREATE operations
- I MUST ALWAYS limit the number of rows returned: `SELECT * FROM [table_name] LIMIT 10;`
- I MUST use selective columns in joins rather than selecting everything

# Performance Optimization

- I MUST use Server Components by default, only convert to Client Components when necessary.
- I SHOULD implement code-splitting via dynamic imports for heavy components using `next/dynamic`.
- I SHOULD split large third-party libraries and only load them when needed.
- I MUST use Next.js Image component with proper width/height to prevent layout shifts.
- I SHOULD add `priority` to key images (LCP elements) to preload them for faster paint.
- I SHOULD define allowed image domains in next.config.js for security and optimization.
- I MUST use Next.js caching with `cache: 'force-cache'` for static data and `cache: 'no-store'` for dynamic data.
- I SHOULD implement client-side caching with SWR or React Query for Supabase requests.
- I SHOULD set appropriate HTTP cache headers in API responses.
- I SHOULD use Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) with revalidation for semi-static content.
- I SHOULD apply proper memoization for expensive computations using useMemo and useCallback.
- I MUST keep bundle size small by avoiding large dependencies.
- I SHOULD optimize media uploads by compressing images and using appropriate video formats.
- I SHOULD implement progressive loading for larger media files.
- I SHOULD use Suspense boundaries and skeleton screens for improved loading UX.
- I MUST ALWAYS paginate data that could grow large.
- I MUST minimize client-side JavaScript and leverage server components.
- I SHOULD set performance budgets (e.g., <200KB JavaScript per page, LCP under 2s on fast 3G).
- I SHOULD measure performance using Lighthouse or Web Vitals.
- I SHOULD optimize third-party scripts using Next.js Script component with appropriate strategies.
- I SHOULD use React DevTools profiler to identify and fix unnecessary re-renders.

## Next.js-Specific Best Practices

- I MUST use data fetching methods appropriately:

  - `getStaticProps` for prerendered content
  - ISR with revalidation intervals for semi-static data
  - `getServerSideProps` only when necessary
  - React's streaming support for progressive rendering

- I MUST optimize routing:

  - Use shallow routing for URL changes that don't require data refetching
  - Set priority on preloaded routes with `next/link`
  - Use declarative `<Link>` rather than imperative navigation

- I MUST structure app directory efficiently:

  - Use route segments to minimize layout re-renders
  - Leverage parallel routes for complex layouts with independent data fetching
  - Create focused layouts to avoid unnecessary re-renders
  - Use route interception for modal patterns

- I SHOULD optimize fonts:

  - Use `next/font` to optimize and load custom fonts
  - Apply size-adjust and font-display swap
  - Limit font variants to only those needed

- I MUST NEVER use these anti-patterns:
  - No data fetching duplication between getStaticPaths and getStaticProps
  - Don't mix client and server data fetching for the same data
  - Minimize client-side state when server-rendering is possible
  - Don't nest layouts unnecessarily

# URL-Based State Management

- I MUST store all significant interaction and view state in the URL:

  - Use route parameters for primary resources (e.g., `/dashboard/instagram/:contentId`)
  - Use query parameters for filters, sorting, pagination (e.g., `?filter=recent&sort=date`)
  - Use hash fragments for scroll positions or tabs (e.g., `#comments`)

- I MUST create separate pages with distinct URLs for each major phase of a workflow:

  - For upload/processing/result workflows, I MUST use distinct URLs:
    - Upload form should have its own page (e.g., `/upload`)
    - Results should have their own page with resource ID (e.g., `/results/:resultId`)
    - Never combine upload and result display on the same page
  - For multi-step processes, each logical step MUST have its own URL path
  - All transitions between workflow states MUST be reflected in URL changes
  - Each page MUST have a single, clear responsibility

- I MUST make modals and dialogs URL-addressable:

  - Create dedicated routes for important modals
  - Use URL query parameters to track modal state
  - Handle browser back/forward navigation with modals

- I MUST reflect search functionality in URLs:

  - All search parameters should be in query parameters
  - Preserve filters between page navigations
  - Support deep linking to search results

- I MUST preserve list view states in URLs:

  - Current pagination page
  - Active filters and sorting options
  - Selected view modes and items per page

- I MUST track form workflows in URLs:

  - Use URL parameters for multi-step form progress
  - Preserve form values on page reload
  - Make form errors retrievable after refresh

- I MUST implement bidirectional sync between URL parameters and React state
- I MUST ensure proper URL parameter encoding/decoding for special characters

# Security Best Practices

- I MUST NEVER interpolate untrusted data directly into dangerouslySetInnerHTML.
- I MUST use DOMPurify to sanitize user-generated content when HTML rendering is necessary.
- I MUST use parameterized queries or Supabase RPC calls for any custom SQL.
- I MUST validate inputs on both client and server side.
- I SHOULD implement a strict Content Security Policy in next.config.js.
- I MUST only allow scripts and resources from trusted sources.
- I MUST set X-Frame-Options: DENY unless iframing is explicitly needed.
- I SHOULD monitor CSP violation reports to detect attempted injections.
- I MUST rely on Supabase's secure authentication flows - NEVER create custom ones.
- I MUST set HttpOnly, Secure, and SameSite attributes for cookie-based sessions.
- I SHOULD use Next.js Middleware to protect sensitive routes at the edge.
- I SHOULD implement rate-limiting for authentication-related API routes.

# Error Handling Standards

- I MUST NEVER use silent fallbacks - failing operations MUST produce explicit errors
- I MUST ALWAYS throw or return appropriate error objects with descriptive messages
- I MUST use try/catch blocks sparingly and only where error recovery is actually possible
- I SHOULD log errors with sufficient context for debugging
- I MUST return helpful and meaningful error messages to the user when operations fail
- I MUST implement proper validation before operations that could fail
- I MUST ensure errors are properly propagated in promise chains for async functions
- I MUST use appropriate HTTP status codes for API error responses
- I SHOULD create custom error classes for different error categories when appropriate

# Testing Strategy

- I SHOULD use Vitest/Jest with React Testing Library for component testing
- I MUST focus on testing observable behavior rather than implementation details
- I SHOULD maintain high coverage (90%+) for core business logic
- I SHOULD test integration between components, pages, and Supabase
- I SHOULD use a test Supabase instance or mock responses for testing
- I SHOULD write E2E tests with Playwright/Cypress for critical user journeys
- I SHOULD run E2E tests on production builds with a dedicated test database
- I SHOULD include accessibility testing in test suites
- I SHOULD block merges if tests fail
- I MUST use mocks sparingly and only when necessary

# CI/CD and Tooling

- I SHOULD use ESLint with Next.js config (`next/core-web-vitals`) and TypeScript rules
- I SHOULD include accessibility linting with `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y`
- I SHOULD use Prettier for code formatting via `eslint-config-prettier`
- I SHOULD set up GitHub Actions to run on every push/PR
- I SHOULD run linting, type-checking, building, and testing in CI
- I SHOULD connect repository to Vercel for automatic deployments
- I SHOULD use Preview Deployments for QA on each PR
- I SHOULD set up Husky for pre-commit and pre-push hooks
- I SHOULD configure error monitoring with Sentry for production

# Figma Design Implementation

## Design Extraction and Accuracy

- I MUST accurately implement all designs from Figma with pixel-perfect precision
- I MUST extract exact color codes from Figma designs and define them as theme variables using the @theme directive in the CSS file:
  ```css
  @import 'tailwindcss';
  @theme {
    --color-brand-primary: #3b82f6;
    --color-brand-secondary: #1e40af;
    /* Add all other colors from Figma */
  }
  ```
- I MUST extract and implement exact spacing, sizing, and layout dimensions from Figma designs
- I MUST match typography styles precisely, including font family, weight, size, line height, and letter spacing
- I MUST translate Figma effects (shadows, blurs, etc.) accurately to their CSS equivalents
- I MUST properly implement all animations and transitions as specified in Figma prototypes
- I MUST maintain design consistency across all breakpoints and responsive variations
- I MUST always download all images from Figma using the mcp_figma_download_figma_images. I will NOT create images myself, I will download and use all of the images from the figma design instead.
