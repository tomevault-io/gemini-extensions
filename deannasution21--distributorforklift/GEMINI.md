# Project Architecture

## Public Pages

- News
- Dynamic Static Pages

---

## Admin Pages

Admin pages include:

- Dashboard
- Products CRUD

---

# Important Architectural Decisions

## 1. Monolith Architecture

This project intentionally uses monolith architecture.

DO NOT:

- Separate frontend/backend into different repositories
- Create unnecessary REST API architecture
- Create microservices

Reason:

- Project scope is medium-scale
- CMS-heavy architecture
- Faster development
- Easier maintenance
- Easier deployment

Use:

- Laravel + Inertia.js

---

## 2. Authentication Rules

Authentication is ADMIN ONLY.

Important:

- Public registration MUST be disabled in production
- Login page is only for internal admin use
- No customer authentication system needed

Future production rules:

- Remove register route
- Keep login route only
- Optional: disable forgot password

---

## 3. CMS Philosophy

The client must be able to manage content independently.

Everything possible should be dynamic through admin dashboard.

DO NOT hardcode:

- hero texts
- hero images
- contact information
- WhatsApp numbers
- email addresses
- static page contents
- SEO metadata

---

# Dynamic Page System

## Dynamic Static Pages

Client requested mini CMS system.

Admin must be able to:

- create pages
- edit pages
- delete pages

Each page contains:

- title
- slug
- description/content
- featured image
- SEO metadata (optional future)
- publish status

Example:

- /tentang-kami
- /layanan
- /karir

Pages should be database-driven.

DO NOT create static Blade/Vue pages manually for each content page.

---

# Product System

## Product Catalog Only

Products are NOT ecommerce products.

There is:

- NO checkout
- NO cart
- NO payment gateway

Products are showcase/catalog only.

Each product includes:

- title
- slug
- short description
- full description
- specifications
- category
- featured image
- gallery images (optional future)

---

# Contact & Inquiry System

- WhatsApp
- Email

Forms may:

- send email
- redirect/send formatted WhatsApp message

No complex CRM needed.
