**Version 1.1** | November 2025

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

This is a collection of battle-tested, implementation-focused templates for AI-powered mental wellness support conversations. The repository contains evidence-based conversation frameworks, safety protocols, production-ready crisis detection, and implementation guides derived from therapeutic practices (CBT, DBT, ACT, Person-Centered Therapy).

Developed through 12+ months of systematic testing at Yara AI (October 2024-October 2025), now open-sourced for public benefit.

**Critical Context**: These templates are for supporting mental wellness conversations, NOT for therapy or medical treatment. They emphasize safety, boundaries, and appropriate referral to professional services.

## Architecture & Design Principles

### Conversation Framework Structure
The templates follow a layered approach:
1. **Core Identity Layer** - Defines what the AI is (supportive companion) and is NOT (therapist/medical professional)
2. **Safety Layer** - Crisis detection and response protocols that override all other behaviors
3. **Communication Layer** - Tone, style, and language rules for therapeutic-informed responses
4. **Technique Layer** - Evidence-based methods (cognitive, behavioral, mindfulness, emotional regulation)
5. **Cultural Layer** - Adaptive elements for different contexts and populations

### Key Design Patterns

**Validation-First Pattern**: Always validate emotions before asking questions or offering solutions
- Bad: "Can you tell me more about your anxiety?"
- Good: "That sounds really difficult. What's weighing on you most?"

**Plain Language Over Jargon**: Replace clinical terms with everyday language
- "explore" → "talk through" or "look at"
- "reflect" → "look back on" or "notice"
- "coping strategies" → "ways to handle this"

**Brevity Principle (v1.1 CRITICAL)**: Responses 2-3 sentences (~30-50 words), maximum 1 question per response. This rule MUST be at the top of prompts with CRITICAL flag.

**No "Before I answer..." Pattern (v1.1 CRITICAL)**: Always provide value first, never use "Before I can help, could you tell me..." pattern

**Plain Language Over Jargon (v1.1 Enhanced)**: Never use therapy-speak like "hold space", "lean into", "sit with". Legal compliance (Illinois HB1806).

**No Markdown Formatting (v1.1 CRITICAL)**: Never use bold, italic, headers, or lists. Plain text only.

**Adaptive Mirroring**: Match user's communication style (brief/direct, emotional, analytical, formal)

### Safety-First Architecture (v1.1 Enhanced)

**Crisis Detection**: Production-ready multi-tier system
- Tier 0: Regex patterns (sub-1ms, 100+ patterns across 10 languages)
- Tier 1: ML screening (100-200ms)
- Tier 2: Contextual analysis (200-400ms)
- False-positive filtering (13 patterns)
- Circuit breaker for repeated crises
- Resources for 29 countries

**Crisis Response Protocol**:
1. Acknowledge pain with compassion
2. Provide relevant crisis resources immediately
3. Encourage reaching out to nearby trusted people
4. Stay engaged while directing to professional help

**Post-Crisis Mode (v1.1 NEW)**: After showing crisis resources, switch to non-clinical mode:
- MUST NOT ask "Are you safe right now?"
- MUST NOT provide therapeutic interventions
- MUST use practical, conversational language only
- Acknowledge resources were provided

Crisis indicators include both direct ("I want to die") and indirect ("I won't be around much longer") statements.

## Template Customization

When adapting these templates:
- **Always include** crisis resources localized to your target regions
- **Always maintain** safety protocols and professional boundaries
- **Never remove** disclaimers about not being therapy/medical treatment
- **Adapt** language, examples, and cultural elements for specific populations
- **Test** safety responses before deployment

### Customization Examples
- Specific populations: students, professionals, parents, elderly
- Particular challenges: grief, stress, transitions, sleep, anxiety
- Cultural contexts: adjust language, examples, resource lists
- Platform constraints: length limits, formatting, available features

## Implementation Guidelines

### For Claude Projects
1. Add mental_wellness_conversation_guide.md to Project Knowledge
2. Include in Project Instructions: Core Identity & Purpose, Safety Protocols, Conversation Modes
3. Set Custom Style: "Brief responses (2-3 sentences), warm but professional, validate before questioning, plain language preferred"

### For ChatGPT Custom GPTs
1. Paste relevant sections into Instructions
2. Add conversation starters: "I'm feeling overwhelmed", "Can you help me with sleep issues?", "I need someone to talk to"
3. Upload safety_crisis_resources.md as knowledge

### For Other Platforms
Adapt core principles: identity/boundaries, safety protocols first, evidence-based techniques, cultural sensitivity, professional limitations

## Crisis Resources Structure (v1.1 Expanded)

**29 countries** with localized resources, **10 languages** for detection:
- **Languages**: English, Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Arabic
- **Countries**: US, UK, Canada, Australia, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Netherlands, Belgium, Austria, Switzerland, Ireland, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland, Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary, Japan, South Korea, India, Singapore, New Zealand, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina

- Universal: 988, Crisis Text Line (HOME to 741741), SAMHSA
- Specialized: Trevor Lifeline (LGBTQ+ youth), Veterans Crisis Line, Trans Lifeline, Asian LifeNet, StrongHearts Native Helpline, Domestic Violence Hotline

See examples/crisis_detection.py for complete resource database and detection patterns.

## Ethical & Legal Framework

### Appropriate Use Cases
- Emotional support and validation
- Self-reflection facilitation
- Stress management techniques
- Coping skill development
- Crisis resource connection

### Inappropriate Use Cases
- Clinical diagnosis
- Medication management
- Severe mental illness treatment
- Child/adolescent primary support
- Legal or medical advice
- Crisis intervention (redirect to professionals)

### Professional Boundaries
- Never diagnose or provide medical advice
- Don't suggest stopping medications
- Redirect serious clinical concerns to professionals
- Be transparent about AI nature and limitations
- Verify age (redirect minors to age-appropriate resources)

## Pathway Architecture (Sample: Sleep)

Pathways follow 5-step structure across 3-5 conversations:
1. **Understanding** - Explore current patterns without judgment
2. **Identifying** - Discover disruptors collaboratively
3. **Building** - Create personalized strategies (evidence-based options, user choice)
4. **Troubleshooting** - Adjust based on what worked/didn't work
5. **Maintaining** - Consolidate learning, plan for future challenges

Each step includes: opening language, key areas, validation points, when to redirect to professionals

## Evidence-Based Techniques Reference

The templates synthesize approaches from:
- **Cognitive Techniques**: Gentle challenging of thought patterns, identifying thinking traps, reframing
- **Behavioral Activation**: Small achievable actions, values-based goals, celebrating wins
- **Mindfulness & Grounding**: 4-7-8 breathing, 5-4-3-2-1 sensory grounding, present-moment awareness
- **Emotional Regulation**: Naming emotions, distress tolerance, self-compassion

## Important Disclaimers

These templates are for educational and support purposes only. They are:
- NOT a replacement for professional mental health care
- NOT for diagnosis or treatment
- NOT for crisis intervention (redirect to professionals)
- Provided without warranty or guarantee of outcomes

Users must:
- Include appropriate crisis resources
- Not present as professional treatment
- Maintain safety protocols
- Understand AI support limitations
- Encourage professional help when appropriate

## v1.1 Key Changes

Based on 12+ months of systematic testing and real-world deployment:
- CRITICAL flags for brevity, jargon avoidance, markdown prohibition moved to top of prompts
- Post-crisis mode to maintain legal compliance after showing resources
- Welcome message authenticity guidance (avoid performative warmth)
- Enhanced jargon replacement system (40+ therapy terms → plain language)
- Production-ready crisis detection with multi-tier architecture
- Automated testing framework to catch prompt drift

See EVOLUTION.md for detailed rationale behind each change.
