## Project Overview

Kopi is a JDK version management tool written in Rust that integrates with your shell to seamlessly switch between different Java Development Kit versions. It fetches JDK metadata from foojay.io and provides a simple, fast interface similar to tools like volta, nvm, and pyenv.

Key features:

- Automatic JDK version switching based on project configuration
- Multiple JDK vendor support (AdoptOpenJDK, Amazon Corretto, Azul Zulu, etc.)
- Shell integration via shims for transparent version management
- Project-specific JDK pinning via `.kopi-version` or `.java-version` files
- Fast performance using Rust

### User Documentation

The user-facing documentation for Kopi is maintained in a separate repository at `../kopi-vm.github.io/`. This repository uses MkDocs to generate and publish documentation for end users.

## Agent Operating Environment

### Planning and Tooling Discipline

- Use the planning tool for any task that is not trivially simple; plans must include at least two steps and be updated as work progresses. Skip planning only for the simplest \~25% of tasks.
- At the start of each session, run `serena__activate_project` to bind Serena to the current repository context.
- After activation, run `serena__check_onboarding_performed`; if it indicates onboarding is incomplete, execute `serena__onboarding` before proceeding.
- At the start of each task, run `bun scripts/trace-status.ts --write` to regenerate `docs/traceability.md` and identify any traceability gaps before continuing.
- Before insert/replace/delete edits, invoke `serena__think_about_task_adherence`; after gathering significant context, call `serena__think_about_collected_information` to confirm understanding.
- Follow the Traceable Development Lifecycle (TDL) for non-trivial work and ensure traceability artifacts stay in sync.

### Approvals and Safety

- Exercise caution with destructive operations (`rm`, `git reset`, etc.); seek explicit user direction before proceeding.
- If unexpected repository changes appear, pause and confirm next steps with the user.

## Developer Principles

### Memory Safety Over Micro-optimization

- Prioritize memory safety and correctness over micro-optimizations
- Accept reasonable overhead (e.g., cloning small strings) to avoid memory leaks
- Follow Rust's ownership model strictly - avoid `unsafe` code and memory leaks from techniques like `Box::leak()`
- When faced with lifetime complexity, prefer simpler solutions that may use slightly more memory but are correct
- Example: Clone strings for HTTP headers instead of using `Box::leak()` to create static references

### Code Clarity

- Write clear, readable code that is easy to understand and maintain
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic, but prefer self-documenting code
- Structure code to minimize cognitive load for future developers

### Clean Code Maintenance

- Remove unused variables, parameters, and struct members promptly
- When refactoring, trace through all callers to eliminate unnecessary parameters
- Keep structs lean by removing fields that are no longer used
- Use `cargo clippy` to identify unused code elements
- Example: If a function parameter like `arch` is no longer used in the implementation, remove it from the function signature and update all callers

### Prefer Functions Over Structs Without State

- When there's no state to manage, prefer implementing functionality as standalone functions rather than defining structs
- Only create structs when you need to maintain state, implement traits, or group related data
- This keeps the code simpler and more straightforward
- Example: For utility operations like file validation or string parsing, use functions directly instead of creating a struct with methods

### External API Testing

- When writing code that calls external Web APIs, implement at least one unit test that includes the actual JSON response obtained from calling the API with curl
- Store the JSON response as a string within the test code
- This ensures that the parsing logic is tested against real API responses
- Example:

```rust
#[test]
fn test_parse_foojay_api_response() {
    // JSON response obtained from: curl https://api.foojay.io/disco/v3.0/packages?version=21
    let json_response = r#"{
        "result": [
            {
                "id": "abcd1234",
                "distribution": "temurin",
                "major_version": 21,
                ...
            }
        ]
    }"#;

    let packages: Vec<Package> = serde_json::from_str(json_response).unwrap();
    assert_eq!(packages[0].distribution, "temurin");
}
```

### Avoid Generic "Manager" Naming

- When the name "manager" appears in file names, structs, traits, or similar constructs, consider more specific and descriptive alternatives
- "Manager" is often too abstract and doesn't clearly communicate the responsibility
- Choose names that describe what the component actually does
- Examples of better alternatives:
  - `FileManager` → `FileSystem`, `FileStore`, `FileRepository`
  - `ConnectionManager` → `ConnectionPool`, `ConnectionFactory`
  - `TaskManager` → `TaskScheduler`, `TaskExecutor`, `TaskQueue`
  - `ShimManager` → `ShimInstaller`, `ShimRegistry`, `ShimProvisioner`
- This principle helps maintain code clarity and makes the codebase more intuitive

### Avoid Vague "Util" or "Utils" Naming

- Never use "util" or "utils" in directory names, file names, class names, or variable names
- These terms are too generic and don't clearly convey the purpose or responsibility
- Always choose specific names that describe the actual functionality
- Examples of better alternatives:
  - `utils/strings.rs` → `string_operations.rs`, `text_processing.rs`, `string_formatter.rs`
  - `FileUtils` → `FileOperations`, `FileSystem`, `PathValidator`
  - `DateUtil` → `DateFormatter`, `DateParser`, `TimeCalculator`
  - `CommonUtils` → Split into specific modules based on functionality
  - `util_function()` → Name based on what it does: `validate_input()`, `format_output()`
- This principle ensures code is self-documenting and responsibilities are clear

### Module Placement Consistency

- Consult `docs/architecture.md` before creating or moving modules so directory structure stays aligned with the documented layout.
- Keep platform-dependent code under `src/platform/` (and its submodules) and expose only cross-platform interfaces from higher layers.
- When introducing new components, document their location rationale in the relevant design or plan to aid future maintainers.

### Prevent Circular Module Dependencies

- Keep the module graph acyclic so features remain testable and maintainable.
- Favor dependency inversion (traits, interfaces) or data transfer structures instead of bidirectional imports when modules must collaborate.
- If a new dependency would close a cycle, refactor by extracting shared functionality into a dedicated module documented in the architecture references.
- Run dependency analysis tools or targeted `cargo check` commands when restructuring to confirm cycles are not introduced.

## Traceable Development Lifecycle (TDL)

_Structured phases, linked artifacts, verifiable outcomes_

This project follows the Traceable Development Lifecycle (TDL), a structured development process with full traceability from discovery through delivery. Consult the primary references when in doubt:

**[`docs/tdl.md`](docs/tdl.md)** - Full TDL documentation and workflow\
**[`docs/templates/README.md`](docs/templates/README.md)** - Template descriptions and usage instructions

### TDL Process Overview

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Analysis] --> R[Requirements]
    A --> ADR[ADR]
    ADR --> R
    R --> T
    ADR --> T
    subgraph T[Task]
      direction LR
      D[Design] <--> P[Plan]
    end
    T --> I[Implementation]
```

### Key Locations

- **Templates**: `docs/templates/` - All document templates
- **Analysis**: `docs/analysis/AN-<id>-<topic>.md` - Problem exploration
- **Requirements**: `docs/requirements/FR-<id>-<capability>.md` and `NFR-<id>-<quality>.md` - Formal requirements
- **ADRs**: `docs/adr/ADR-<id>-<title>.md` - Architecture decisions (current format)
- **Tasks**: `docs/tasks/T-<id>-<task>/` - Design and plan documents (current format)
- **Traceability**: `docs/traceability.md` - Central mapping matrix

### Document Workflow & Approvals

**Cross-Stage Governance**

- **Approval Rules**
  - **Stage Separation**: Complete only one stage per approval cycle; never advance without an explicit “go”.
  - **Clarity Guardrail**: Treat ambiguous instructions as cues to request confirmation.
  - **Status Maintenance**: Keep document metadata current so reviewers know the active phase.

- **Exception Handling**
  - **Immediate Pause**: If work advanced without the required approval—or a prerequisite artifact is missing—stop immediately.
  - **User Decision**: Ask whether to delete the premature work and restart or treat it as a draft for sequential review.
  - **Upstream Gap**: When a needed analysis, requirement, or ADR is absent, suspend implementation, create the missing document via templates, secure approval, and only then resume coding.

**Stage-by-Stage Flow**

1. **Analysis (`docs/analysis/AN-…`)**
   - **Deliverable**: Problem statement with context, alternatives, and recommendation.
   - **Approval Gate**: Share the draft and wait for explicit approval before drafting requirements.

2. **Requirements (`docs/requirements/FR-…` / `NFR-…`)**
   - **Deliverable**: Verifiable functional and non-functional requirements derived from the approved analysis.
   - **Approval Gate**: Present the requirements and wait for explicit approval before writing the ADR.

3. **Architecture Decision (`docs/adr/ADR-…`)**
   - **Deliverable**: Decision record describing the structural approach that satisfies the requirements.
   - **Approval Gate**: Submit the ADR and wait for explicit approval before creating the task package.

4. **Task Package (`docs/tasks/T-…/`)**
   - **Deliverable**: Task directory with `design.md`, `plan.md`, and an updated `README.md` linked to upstream artifacts.
   - **Approval Gate**: Share the task documents and wait for explicit approval before starting implementation.

5. **Implementation**
   - **Deliverable**: Code and supporting assets tied to the approved task.
   - **Approval Gate**:
     - Treat every phase listed in `plan.md` as its own approval checkpoint.
     - After finishing a phase, immediately stop, mark the corresponding checklist item as `[x]`, and request explicit approval to proceed.
     - Do not write code, run tests, or change artefacts for the next phase until that approval is received.
     - If approval is missing or unclear at any point, halt all implementation work and ask the approver how to proceed; the only permitted actions while waiting are housekeeping required to request approval (e.g., summarising work done or reverting unintended edits).

## Development Workflow

### Completing Work

#### Rust Code

When finishing any Rust coding task, always run the following commands in order and fix any issues:

1. `cargo fmt` - Auto-format code
2. `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` - Check for linting errors in test code
3. `cargo test --lib --quiet` - Run unit tests (faster than full test suite)

Address any errors from each command before proceeding to the next. All must pass successfully before considering the work complete.

#### Markdown Documentation

When working on Markdown documentation (`.md` files), run the following commands:

1. `bun format` - Auto-format markdown files
   - Automatically fixes formatting issues
   - Ensures consistent markdown style across all documentation

2. `bun lint` - Check markdown linting
   - Identifies potential issues and violations
   - Common issues: trailing spaces, inconsistent indentation, missing blank lines
   - Fix any warnings or errors reported

Both commands must pass successfully before considering the documentation work complete. After the document is finalized, compare it against the source template (for example, `docs/templates/analysis.md`) to confirm the Metadata, Links, and status selections remain consistent with the current standards.

#### TypeScript Code

When editing any TypeScript files, run each of the following commands and resolve any reported errors before moving on:

1. `bun format:ts` - Format TypeScript sources
2. `bun lint:ts` - Lint TypeScript code with project rules
3. `AGENT=1 bun test:ts` - Execute the TypeScript test suite

All three commands must complete without errors to finish TypeScript-related work.

### Documentation Updates

- Ensure documentation, comments, and messages remain in English.
- For Markdown changes, run `bun format` followed by `bun lint` and resolve any reported issues before finalizing.
- If `docs/traceability.md` is missing or you add or remove any files under `docs/`, run `bun scripts/trace-status.ts --write` to regenerate the traceability matrix before completing the work.
- During implementation, mark the completed phase checkboxes in the relevant documents at the end of each phase so progress stays transparent and auditable.

## Essential Commands

- **Format**: `cargo fmt` - Format code using rustfmt
- **Lint**: `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` - Run linter with strict warnings
- **Build**: `cargo build` (debug), `cargo build --release` (production)
- **Test**: `cargo test --lib --quiet` - Run unit tests efficiently

## Additional Documentation

- **Architecture & Structure**: [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) - Project structure, components, and storage locations
- **Error Handling**: [`docs/error_handling.md`](docs/error_handling.md) - Error types, exit codes, and context system

## Communication Guidelines

- Default to concise, friendly teammate tone; structure responses for quick scanning without over-formatting.
- Lead code-change summaries with the key outcome, then reference affected paths with `path:line` format (no ranges).
- Use bullets (`-`) for lists, avoid nested bullets, and reserve headings for major sections only when helpful.
- Include suggested next steps (tests, commits, verification) when they naturally follow from the work performed.
- Do not paste entire file contents; reference file paths instead.
- When the user requests command output, summarize relevant lines rather than dumping full logs.
- Execute simple user requests via shell commands when appropriate (e.g., `date`), respecting the environment rules above.
