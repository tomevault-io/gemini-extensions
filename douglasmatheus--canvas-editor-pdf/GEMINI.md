## What this project is

`canvas-editor-pdf` is a PDF exporter for [@hufe921/canvas-editor](https://github.com/Hufe921/canvas-editor). It re-implements the editor's rendering pipeline against [jsPDF](https://github.com/parallax/jsPDF)'s `Context2d` (a canvas-like API that emits PDF instructions) instead of an `HTMLCanvasElement`.

The library is published to npm as `canvas-editor-pdf`. `@hufe921/canvas-editor` is a peer dependency — consumers install both. There is no demo / playground — this is a library-only project.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | `vite build --mode lib-browser --watch` → rebuilds the browser bundle in `dist/` on every save. Use this when testing the library via `npm link` from a consumer. |
| `npm run build` | Full build: lint → browser bundle → Node ESM bundle → Node CJS bundle → `tsc` (types in `dist/types/`). |
| `npm run build:browser` | `vite build --mode lib-browser` → `dist/canvas-editor-pdf.{es,umd}.js` |
| `npm run build:node:esm` | `vite build --mode lib-node` → `dist/node/index.es.js` |
| `npm run build:node:cjs` | `vite build --mode lib-node-cjs` → `dist/node/index.cjs.js` |
| `npm run build:types` | `tsc -p tsconfig.json` → `.d.ts` files in `dist/types/` |
| `npm run lint` | ESLint over the repo |
| `npm run cypress:open` / `npm run cypress:run` | E2E tests (Cypress) — **note:** the test files were inherited from canvas-editor and currently target a demo URL / import paths that no longer exist. Treat as broken until rewritten. |
| `node scripts/smoke/node/run.mjs` | Manual Node smoke test (renders the shared fixture to `scripts/smoke/out/out-node.pdf`). Requires a prior `npm run build`. |
| `npx serve scripts/smoke/browser` | Serve the browser smoke test page (open in browser, click "Generate PDF"). |

## Testing

Right now the only tests are the **manual smoke scripts** under
[scripts/smoke/](scripts/smoke/) (Cypress is inherited from upstream and
broken — treat as non-functional). Roadmap for automated coverage, cheapest
first; each level is independent:

1. **Unit tests for the platform shim** (Vitest — the project already uses
   Vite). Test each `IPlatform` method in isolation, run twice (browser shim
   under JSDOM/`@vitest/browser`, Node shim natively): `createMeasurementCanvas()`
   returns a working `measureText`; `loadFontAsBase64()` returns non-empty
   base64; `svgToPngDataUrl()` returns a `data:image/png;base64,…`. → `tests/platform/`
2. **PDF output assertions** (medium). Render the same fixture in browser and
   Node, then use `pdf-parse`/`pdfjs-dist` to compare *extracted text per page*
   (deterministic) rather than raw bytes — also check page count and presence
   of image XObjects. → `tests/integration/`
3. **Visual diff with tolerance** (advanced). Rasterize each PDF page to PNG
   (`pdfjs-dist` or `@napi-rs/canvas`) and compare against a baseline with
   `pixelmatch` at a threshold (~5%). Save diffs for human inspection. → `tests/visual/`
4. **Property-based fuzzing** (bonus). `fast-check` to generate random
   `IEditorData` and assert `render()` never throws.

Suggested priority: shim units next (high value, cheap), then output
assertions, then visual/fuzzing on demand once subtle rendering bugs appear.

## Reducing published font size

`public/font/` ships full TTFs; `msyh.ttf` / `msyh-bold.ttf` (CJK) alone are
~35 MB of the ~42 MB package. [scripts/subset-fonts.md](scripts/subset-fonts.md)
documents how to subset them with `pyftsubset` before a release. It's optional
and **not** wired into `npm run build`.

## Consumer-facing examples

[examples/](examples/) holds copy-pasteable code snippets for the most common
consumer scenarios (Next.js Pages Router, Next.js App Router, Express,
standalone Node script, browser frontend). When the public API changes —
constructor signature, `fontSource` option, peer deps — update those files so
README links don't drift out of sync.

Release flow: `scripts/release.js` validates `dist/` exists, strips `dependencies` from `package.json`, runs `npm publish`, then restores `package.json`.

## Big-picture architecture

### Entry point is dual-purpose

[src/index.ts](src/index.ts) is **both** the library entry (`vite.config.ts` mode `lib`) and the demo script (`index.html` references `/src/index.ts`). It exports `DrawPdf` and the `svgString2Image` helper plus a couple of types.

### `DrawPdf` is the whole library

[src/core/draw/DrawPdf.ts](src/core/draw/DrawPdf.ts) is the orchestrator. The consumer flow is:

```js
const instance = new DrawPdf(options, data, { loadDefaultFonts: true })
await instance.setValue(data)   // optional, async because LaTeX SVG→PNG
instance.render()                // builds the jsPDF document in memory
instance.getPdf().save('x.pdf')  // download
```

`DrawPdf` instantiates and wires together:

- **Frames** ([src/core/draw/frame/](src/core/draw/frame/)) — full-page chrome drawn per page: `Background`, `Margin`, `Header`, `Footer`, `PageNumber`, `LineNumber`, `Watermark`, `PageBorder`, `Placeholder`.
- **Particles** ([src/core/draw/particle/](src/core/draw/particle/)) — individual element renderers: `TextParticle`, `ImageParticle`, `Checkbox`, `Radio`, `Hyperlink`, `ListParticle`, `Separator`, `Subscript`, `Superscript`, `LineBreak`, plus subfolders for `block/`, `date/`, `latex/`, `previewer/`, `table/`.
- **Rich text decorators** ([src/core/draw/richtext/](src/core/draw/richtext/)) — `Highlight`, `Underline`, `Strikeout` (extend `AbstractRichText`).
- **Position** ([src/core/position/Position.ts](src/core/position/Position.ts)) — computes element/row coordinates.

### Render pipeline (per page)

`DrawPdf.render()` → computes row/page layout → `_immediateRender()` → loops pages → `_drawPage(pageNo)`:

1. `background.render` — page background color/image
2. `margin.render` — visible margin (skipped in `PRINT` mode)
3. `_drawFloat({ imgDisplays: [FLOAT_BOTTOM] })` — float images behind text
4. `drawRow(...)` — main content (text + inline particles + tables + etc.)
5. Paging mode only: header, page number, footer
6. `_drawFloat({ imgDisplays: [FLOAT_TOP, SURROUND] })` — float images in front of text
7. Watermark, placeholder (if empty), line numbers, page border

The order is what guarantees correct layering. **A particle's `render()` should NOT call back into `this.draw.render()`** — that causes infinite recursion (this was bug fixed in 2026-05 for `FLOAT_BOTTOM` images).

### Platform shim (browser vs Node)

[src/platform/](src/platform/) abstracts the few environment-specific APIs the renderer needs (DOM canvas for `measureText`, `fetch`/`fs` for fonts, `Image`/`@resvg/resvg-js` for SVG→PNG):

- [types.ts](src/platform/types.ts) — the `IPlatform` interface.
- [browser.ts](src/platform/browser.ts) — DOM canvas + `fetch` + `Image`.
- [node.ts](src/platform/node.ts) — `@napi-rs/canvas` + `node:fs/promises` + `@resvg/resvg-js`.
- [current.ts](src/platform/current.ts) — defaults to re-exporting `browser`. The Node build (`vite --mode lib-node`/`lib-node-cjs`) swaps it for `node` via a regex `resolve.alias` (`^.+/platform/current(\.ts)?$` → `src/platform/node.ts`).

`DrawPdf`, `Watermark`, and `ImageParticle` import only from `./platform/current`. Don't import `./platform/browser` or `./platform/node` directly — that would lock the call site to one runtime.

[src/node.ts](src/node.ts) is a second entry point used only by the Node build (`canvas-editor-pdf/node`). It re-exports the same symbols as `src/index.ts`.

`src/platform/node.ts#getBundledFontPath` resolves `dist/font/<file>` via `new URL('../font/' + fileName, import.meta.url)` + `fileURLToPath()`. Vite 5+ preserves `import.meta.url` in lib mode for ESM and emits a runtime polyfill for CJS, so the same source line works in both bundles.

> Historical note: pre-v0.4.0 (when this repo was still on Vite 2), `import.meta` was statically stubbed away in lib mode. The original workaround used a `generateBundle` hook to re-inject a `__moduleUrl__` constant after Vite's rewrite. The Vite 5 upgrade removed the need for that plugin — see git history if you're chasing a regression.

### Most of `src/core/` is dead-weight scaffolding

The folders `actuator/`, `cursor/`, `event/`, `history/`, `i18n/`, `listener/`, `observer/`, `override/`, `plugin/`, `range/`, `register/`, `shortcut/`, `worker/`, `zone/` mirror the canvas-editor layout but are mostly **not used** by `DrawPdf`. They exist so the diff against upstream stays readable when porting fixes. Don't expect them to do anything — wire-up lives in `DrawPdf` constructor.

[src/editor/](src/editor/) is similarly vestigial — only `editor/core/draw/control/Control.ts` survives.

### Types and enums are duplicated from canvas-editor

[src/interface/](src/interface/) and [src/dataset/enum/](src/dataset/enum/) are **copies** of canvas-editor's types/enums, not re-exports. This is intentional (lets the library evolve independently) but causes friction at the consumer boundary: `IElement` here ≠ `IElement` from `@hufe921/canvas-editor`. Consumers typically `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(editor.command.getValue().data))` to cross the boundary — that's a known wart, not a bug.

Pre-0.4.0, three enum files ([Common.ts](src/dataset/enum/Common.ts), [Editor.ts](src/dataset/enum/Editor.ts), [Element.ts](src/dataset/enum/Element.ts)) were **re-exports** rather than copies. That broke the Node ESM build because canvas-editor publishes as CJS and Node's ESM-CJS interop can't analyze named exports. As of 0.4.0 those files are local copies too — keep them in sync with upstream enum values if you ever pull updates.

## Gotchas for editing

- **jsPDF loads fonts synchronously** — instantiating with many fonts can freeze the UI. As of v0.2.12, default fonts are **opt-in** via `{ loadDefaultFonts: true }` in the constructor (or `instance.loadDefaultFonts()` later). Don't add font loading to the constructor's hot path.
- **jsPDF doesn't support SVG** — LaTeX elements (`element.laTexSVG`) must be pre-converted to PNG via the exported `svgString2Image(svgString, w, h, 'png', cb)` helper before `render()`. See README for the consumer-side pattern.
- **Build externals** — `vite.config.ts` externalizes `@hufe921/canvas-editor` and `jspdf` in `lib` mode. Don't import from those expecting them to be bundled.
- **Code style** — ESLint enforces `semi: never` (no trailing semicolons) and single quotes. Prettier: 80 col, no trailing comma, `arrowParens: 'avoid'`, LF line endings.
- **TS** — `strict: true`, `noUnusedLocals`, `noUnusedParameters`, `emitDeclarationOnly: true` (vite handles the JS output, tsc only emits `.d.ts`).

## Where to start when…

- **Bug in PDF output for a specific element type** → find the matching `*Particle.ts` under [src/core/draw/particle/](src/core/draw/particle/) and check its `render()`.
- **Page chrome bug (header/footer/margin/etc.)** → [src/core/draw/frame/](src/core/draw/frame/).
- **Wrong layout / element positioning** → [src/core/position/Position.ts](src/core/position/Position.ts) + `computeRowList` / `_computePageList` in `DrawPdf`.
- **Adding a feature that upstream canvas-editor already has** → diff against the upstream file (paths mirror exactly) and port the changes; the `// 中文` comments are a hint that the line came from upstream.
