# ASI — agent guide

ASI is SlopDotCash's JAX continual-learning research and hillclimbing project. Its
north star is one end-to-end agent that keeps learning through an operational
life, retains and reuses useful knowledge, adapts without whole-agent or
task-by-task reinitialization, operates within explicit compute, memory, and
latency budgets, and scales from research benchmarks to real work — especially
robotics.
State-of-the-art continual learning is the destination, not a current claim.

[The Alberta Plan](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11173) is a foundational
inspiration and a source of inherited mechanisms, vocabulary, and file names.
It is not ASI's specification or outer boundary. Follow the evidence wherever
it leads: improve Alberta-derived ideas, combine them with other continual-
learning and reinforcement-learning methods, or replace them when stronger
concepts win.

This tree is a **development fork** of `lalalune/alberta` (fork point
`2ac3533`), not a lightly-patched vendor copy — see `VENDORING.md` for the
divergence summary and canonical upstream URL. ASI is the project identity;
`alberta_framework`, the `alberta-framework` distribution, `alberta-*` CLIs,
and historical schema IDs remain compatibility and provenance interfaces. Do
not casually rename them. The robot track imports the continual-RL subset
in-process; keep `requires-python >= 3.12`, the `numpy >= 1.26` floor, and the
existing import surface intact.

**Current program hillclimb:** run a permanently nonpromoting matched
development scorecard across `SwitchingTwoStateMDP` and `RiverSwimMDP` with
frozen/no-learning, random, finite-horizon privileged dynamic-programming, and
strong SARSA-family controls plus explicit resource accounting. This is
development selection only; it does not populate `reference-dev` or create
performance or scientific evidence.

The scorecard implementation is in
`alberta_framework/{reference_life_controls.py,benchmarks/reference_life_scorecard.py}`
and runs through `asi-reference-life-scorecard`. Its literal-frozen plan has
12 consumed development seeds, 2 environments, and 6 arms (144 fresh-process
shards); every shard binds its current source identity, and aggregation requires
one matching current identity. The privileged normalization arm is an
environment-bound finite-horizon dynamic-programming control and is excluded
from candidate Pareto comparisons.
All agent RNG roots use explicit Threefry keys. Records enforce the fixed reward
lattice, complete counters, canonical initial/final numeric payload accounting
(including static oracle policy bytes), and permanently nonpromoting policy.
Timing remains telemetry-only until a separately qualified timing protocol
exists. The implementation and validators do not constitute a completed run or
performance result; consistency hashes are not authenticated execution proof.

The unfrozen `preview1` transaction protocol, pure reducer/CAS ledger,
primitive-only exact-dispatch Prototype bridge, and aggregate runner are in
`alberta_framework/{reference_agent,prototype_reference_adapter,reference_life}.py`.
One immutable aggregate owns agent, environment, transaction, dispatch, RNG
cursor, metrics, counters, recovery state, transcript, and generations. Its
process-local outer lock covers command issuance through execution, receipt,
outcome, learning/metrics staging, and one aggregate commit; retained tests
cover concurrency, horizon, strict execution validation, faults, and
no-redispatch pending-outcome recovery. The primitive RiverSwim slice uses a
distinct environment manifest/state discriminator and stationary metrics,
rejects configurations outside `2 <= n_states <= 12` before its exponential
oracle is constructed, passes the exact same runner-derived JAX key to
execution and validation, and replays the keyed stochastic transition during
strict validation.

The development-only checkpoint codec in
`alberta_framework/reference_life_checkpoint.py`, covered by
`tests/test_reference_life_checkpoint.py` and
`tests/test_reference_life_riverswim_checkpoint.py`, now implements the
current-schema quiescent whole-life checkpoint and exact-resume gate for the
primitive Prototype + SwitchingTwoState and Prototype + RiverSwim lives. A
successful save uses Linux atomic no-replace publication for one immutable
generation, advances commit/checkpoint generations, nests the complete
Prototype v3 checkpoint, binds the aggregate state plus current
source/runtime/dependency identities and consistency hashes, reconstructs fresh
components from the environment discriminator, validates strict
cross-component adoption, and produces exact original-versus-restored
continuation from the same persisted barrier.

This remains a `preview1` L0 mechanism, not a frozen or portable checkpoint
contract, `reference-dev`, safety conformance, robotics readiness, RiverSwim
learning or performance benefit, performance evidence, or scientific evidence.
Checkpoints support only quiescent pre-completion state for the two implemented
simulators and fail closed across current source/runtime/dependency drift; they
do not restore in-flight, halted,
pending-outcome, completed, or physical state. The hashes bind consistency but
are not authenticated execution attestation. The ordinary-`Exception`
at-most-once guard remains process-local and supplies no process-death,
`BaseException`, durable/idempotent executor, hardware-delivery, or
reconciled-resume guarantee. Independent safety/veto, options,
replacement/rebinding, boundaries, wire/durable dispatch replay,
additional/general environment support, Forager, and robot adapters remain
open. In the monorepo, use
`../robot/docs/asimov-1.md` and
`../robot/docs/ALBERTA_PRODUCTION_READINESS.md` as the existing ASIMOV-1
application interface and open-gate record; do not create a duplicate robotics
ladder or treat its smoke plumbing as performance evidence.

**Current measured subsystem campaign:** IPMNIST development screening and
development confirmation is one plasticity/conditioning lane, not the
definition of ASI. It is permanently nonpromoting. Results move; read the
`summary_*.json` files and `publication_runs/RESULTS.md` under
`outputs/ipmnist_screening/` instead of copying numbers into overview docs,
and re-measure the selected control before any A/B. The theory snapshot is
`docs/research/ipmnist-theory.md`; raw records and audits live beside the
outputs. Check `docs/evidence/negative-results.md` before retrying an idea.

## Research operating loop

- **Measure the live baseline.** Bind the current source, workload, seeds,
  resources, and pre-update metric before comparing a change.
- **Name the bottleneck and hypothesis.** State the predicted benefit, causal
  mechanism, resource cost, ablation, and failure condition before a long run.
- **Build an end-to-end slice.** Prefer changes that run through the existing
  agent and environment interfaces over isolated surfaces with no consumer.
- **Screen cheaply and honestly.** Development runs select and reject ideas;
  use paired schedules and strong baselines, and never treat screening as
  promotion.
- **Test transfer, retention, and control.** A local score improvement is
  provisional until it survives recurrence or distribution change, resource
  accounting, and a downstream agent/control check.
- **Advance development, then evaluate scientifically.** A matched development
  win may enter the explicitly nonpromoting `reference-dev` configuration
  after its regression panel passes. Freeze a separate protocol with fresh
  seeds only when a claim warrants scientific evaluation.
- **Integrate and remeasure.** Record negative results, keep resource-acceptable
  wins in the appropriate reference channel, and rerun the whole-life
  scorecard before the next hillclimb.

Prioritize work that closes an integration gap or resolves a high-value
uncertainty. More APIs, mechanisms, or tests are not progress by themselves.

`docs/research/asi-roadmap.md`.

## Running things

Always use the project venv:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/<file> -q                  # one file
.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests -q                         # full suite
.venv/bin/python -m pytest --collect-only -q | tail -1     # count of record
.venv/bin/python -m ruff check .                           # lint (line length 100)
.venv/bin/python -m mypy                                   # strict, py312
.venv/bin/alberta-evidence-status                          # evidence registry
```

See `[project.scripts]` in `pyproject.toml` for the current console-script
inventory. The ones you'll reach for are `asi-reference-life-scorecard`,
`alberta-evidence-status`,
`alberta-forager-benchmark`, `alberta-foragax-open-screen`, and the
`alberta-forager-matched-*` family. Benchmark executions happen through
scripts/CLIs, never inside pytest — tests must stay CI-cheap unless
explicitly registered as a scientific lane.

## Marker lanes

- `unit` — fast isolated behavior/contract tests; never scientific evidence.
- `integration` — spans components, persistence, or process/CLI boundaries.
- `scientific` — frozen promoted-evidence protocols; may be expensive and
  require preregistered seeds.
- `slow` — wall-clock heavy modules (>~30s serial); excluded from the fast
  per-PR CI lane.
- `package` — built-distribution and installed-entry-point contracts; isolated
  in the package CI lane.

The fast runtime selector is `-m "not slow and not package"`.

## Evidence-promotion rules (fail-closed)

- **Never auto-promote.** Passing tests, replays, or reruns do not upgrade a
  claim. Promotion requires a frozen preregistered protocol, untouched
  held-out seeds, a versioned artifact schema, and its strict validator
  accepting the artifact.
- **Frozen seeds stay frozen.** Calibration/development seeds and consumed
  evidence seeds can never be reused for promotion. Consumed-seed replays are
  explicitly nonpromoting.
- **Pinned `outputs/` artifacts are immutable.** Never overwrite, edit, or
  delete `outputs/ftl_decision/` (sha-pinned), `outputs/continual_ia/`
  (historical chain + source snapshot), `outputs/recurring_feature/`,
  `outputs/scale_robust_feature/evidence.v2.json`,
  `outputs/continual_multiagent/`, `outputs/step2_canonical/`,
  `outputs/evidence_manifest.json`, the sealed/`QUARANTINED.md` forager
  roots, or the chmod-frozen negative-result dirs. New runs write to NEW
  paths and new schema versions. `outputs/ipmnist_screening/` and
  `outputs/upgd_ipmnist/` hold the active campaign's development artifacts —
  append, don't rewrite.
- **Registered source hashes are load-bearing.** Editing a registered source
  file invalidates persisted evidence until the frozen protocol is rerun; the
  registry reports `invalid` (exit 2) — that is working-as-designed, not a
  bug to silence. Read `alberta_framework/evaluation/evidence_manifest.py`
  for the current
  five-claim source inventory, and inspect each development lane's own source
  manifest before touching it. Counts in narrative docs are not authoritative.
- Thresholds are calibrated empirically on development data with ≥2x margins,
  then frozen. Retuning a threshold after seeing held-out results is
  disallowed (a failed gate stays a valid rejection).
- Library changes are failing-test-first; state is frozen chex dataclasses;
  RNG uses explicit `jr.key(...)` seeds.

## Evidence registry (5 claims)

`alberta-evidence-status` exits `0` (all accepted), `1` (valid rejection or
missing), `2` (invalid). Each claim's CLI is also
`.venv/bin/python -m alberta_framework.evaluation.<module>`.

Run the command for live status. A claim becomes `invalid` when its registered
source bytes no longer match the pinned artifact; unrelated dirty-worktree
changes alone are not a registered-source mismatch. The frozen outcomes
recorded in the pinned artifacts are:

| Claim | Frozen artifact outcome | Artifact | CLI |
|---|---|---|---|
| `recurring_pair_features` | accepted (narrow L2) | `outputs/recurring_feature/evidence.v1.json` | `alberta-recurring-feature-evidence` |
| `scale_robust_pair_features` | accepted (narrow L2) | `outputs/scale_robust_feature/evidence.v2.json` | `alberta-scale-robust-evidence` |
| `ftl_world_model_decision_fidelity` | accepted (historical chain) | `outputs/ftl_decision/evidence.v1.json` | `alberta-ftl-evidence` |
| `recurring_multiagent_coadaptation` | accepted (narrow L2) | `outputs/continual_multiagent/evidence.json` | `alberta-multiagent-evidence` |
| `continual_intelligence_amplification` | valid rejection (frozen 10% gate) | `outputs/continual_ia/evidence.json` | `alberta-ia-evidence` |

No accepted claim establishes an integrated ASI agent, robotics readiness,
state of the art, or Alberta Plan completion; keep README/status wording narrow
and honest.

## Files that are load-bearing outside the docs

- `FORAGER_BENCHMARK.md` is hashed into Forager run provenance
  (`forager_cli._source_tree_sha256`) — edits change benchmark receipts.
- `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and `FORAGER_BENCHMARK.md` ship in the sdist.
- The CHANGELOG version heading is asserted by `test_release_metadata.py`.
- The robot track imports `core/{actor_critic,continual_backprop,
  initializers,normalizers,optimizers,sarsa}` via `import
  alberta_framework` — `alberta_framework/__init__.py` must stay importable,
  so every module deletion is a two-file change.

## Conventions

- ruff line length 100; ESM/TS conventions do not apply here — this is a pure
  Python track.
- Use **ASI** for the current project and research program. Preserve Alberta
  names when referring to upstream history, Plan-specific mechanisms, the
  compatibility package/CLI surface, or historical evidence identifiers.
- `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` are identical: author `CLAUDE.md`, copy to
  `AGENTS.md`.
