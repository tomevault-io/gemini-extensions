LifeOS is a self-hosted AI assistant that indexes personal data (notes, emails, messages, photos, financial data) for semantic search, synthesis, and proactive intelligence. Runs on Linux or macOS. Optionally, a Mac can act as an Apple Data Agent for iMessage, phone calls, and contacts.

---

## Key Concepts

- **Two-tier data model**: SourceEntity (raw observations from each data source) → PersonEntity (canonical, merged records per person). See [ADR-003](docs/adr/003-two-tier-data-model.md).
- **Hybrid search**: Vector similarity (ChromaDB) + keyword matching (BM25/FTS5), fused via Reciprocal Rank Fusion. See [ADR-004](docs/adr/004-hybrid-search.md).
- **Entity resolution**: Links emails, phones, and names across sources to canonical people using fuzzy matching with scoring.
- **Sync phases**: Seven-phase nightly pipeline — Collection → Entity Processing → Relationship Building → Indexing → Content Sync → Entity Cleanup → Consistency Verification.
- **Agentic chat**: Local LLM autonomously calls 15 tools (search, calendar, email, tasks, etc.) across multiple rounds to answer queries.

## Development Principles

These apply to all agents. Bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

### 1. Think Before Acting

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

- State assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them — don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

### 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.
- Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

### 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it — don't delete it.
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

### 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For non-trivial features, follow this cycle:

1. Define requirements (what does "done" look like?)
2. Write tests that pass if and only if requirements are met
3. Plan the implementation approach
4. Implement — deliver production code and tests together
5. Adversarial review — compare implementation against requirements; identify gaps, missed edge cases, deviations from spec
6. Close gaps and re-verify

Steps 5–6 repeat until no meaningful gaps remain.

For smaller tasks, a brief inline plan suffices:
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]

### 5. Tests Are Sacred

- Never skip or weaken tests to make code pass.
- All fixes must consider effects on the full system, not just one test.
- Pre-existing test failures are documented — don't "fix" them without understanding context.

**When an existing test fails after your changes:**

The default assumption is that your code is wrong, not the test. Before modifying any test, answer:
1. What was this test originally meant to verify?
2. Why is it failing — what specific change caused it?
3. Is the correct fix to (a) fix your code, (b) update the test for intentionally changed behavior, or (c) remove the test because the behavior no longer exists?

Option (a) is the default. Options (b) and (c) require explicit justification.

**Never:**
- Delete a failing test to make the suite pass.
- Mark a test as skipped/xfail to unblock a commit.
- Rewrite a test you don't fully understand.
- Assume a flaky test is "just flaky" without investigating.

### 6. Privacy Is Non-Negotiable

- LifeOS handles deeply personal data: emails, messages, photos, finances, therapy notes.
- Never log, expose, or transmit personal data beyond what the system requires.
- All data stays local. LLM inference runs locally — no data leaves the machine.
- Use obviously synthetic data in all documentation and test fixtures.
- Security-sensitive implementation details belong in code, not docs.
- When in doubt about whether something is a privacy concern, treat it as one.

## Boundaries

Quick-reference guardrails for all contributors. These complement the Development Principles above with a scannable list.

| Tier | Action |
|------|--------|
| **Always** | Run full test suite before commit |
| **Always** | Restart server after Python changes |
| **Always** | Use `./scripts/server.sh` for server management |
| **Always** | Use obviously synthetic data in tests and docs |
| **Ask first** | Database schema changes (new or altered tables) |
| **Ask first** | Adding new third-party dependencies |
| **Ask first** | Public API changes (new or modified endpoints) |
| **Ask first** | Changes to sync pipeline phases or cron jobs |
| **Ask first** | Changes to MCP tool definitions |
| **Never** | Commit secrets, credentials, or API keys |
| **Never** | Force push to main |
| **Never** | Skip pre-commit hooks (`--no-verify`) |
| **Never** | Log, print, or expose real personal data |
| **Never** | Run uvicorn directly (use `./scripts/server.sh`) |

---

## Development Workflow

**Branch naming:** `<type>/<short-description>` where type is one of: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `chore`. Lowercase, hyphen-separated.

1. **Edit code**
2. **Restart server**: `./scripts/server.sh restart` (or `sudo systemctl restart lifeos-api`)
3. **Test manually** or run tests: `./scripts/test.sh`
4. **Deploy**: `./scripts/deploy.sh "Your commit message"`

## Dependency Management

**Single source of truth**: `requirements.txt`
**Virtual environment**: `~/.venvs/lifeos` (external — see [ADR-005](docs/adr/005-external-venv-macos-tcc.md))

### Adding a new dependency

1. Add to `requirements.txt`
2. Install: `~/.venvs/lifeos/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Restart server: `./scripts/server.sh restart`

### Testing

```bash
./scripts/test.sh              # Unit tests (fast, ~30s)
./scripts/test.sh smoke        # Unit + critical browser (used by deploy)
./scripts/test.sh all          # Full test suite
```

---

## Server Management — CRITICAL

**NEVER run uvicorn or start the server directly.** Always use the provided scripts:

```bash
./scripts/server.sh start    # Start server (background)
./scripts/server.sh stop     # Stop server
./scripts/server.sh restart  # Restart after code changes
./scripts/server.sh status   # Check if running
```

On Linux, services are managed by systemd (installed via `sudo ./scripts/setup-systemd.sh`):

```bash
sudo systemctl restart lifeos-api        # Restart API server
sudo systemctl status lifeos-api         # Check status
sudo systemctl status lifeos-chromadb    # Check ChromaDB
sudo systemctl status lifeos-llm         # Check local LLM (llama-server)
systemctl list-timers lifeos-*           # Check sync/watchdog timers
```

Always restart the server after modifying Python files. The server does NOT auto-reload.

### Why This Matters

Running `uvicorn api.main:app` directly causes **ghost server processes**:

1. The script binds to `0.0.0.0:8000` (all interfaces including Tailscale)
2. Direct uvicorn often binds only to `127.0.0.1:8000` (localhost)
3. This creates TWO servers on different interfaces
4. User sees different behavior via localhost vs Tailscale/network
5. Code changes appear to "not work" because the wrong server handles requests

## Common Tasks

### Check Service Health

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health/full | jq          # All endpoints
curl http://localhost:8000/health/services | jq      # External services
```

### Search for a Person

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/crm/people?q=Name" | jq '.people[0]'
```

### Run a Search Query

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "search terms", "top_k": 10}' | jq
```

### Trigger Vault Reindex

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/admin/reindex
```

### Run Manual Sync

```bash
~/.venvs/lifeos/bin/python scripts/run_all_syncs.py --dry-run     # Preview
~/.venvs/lifeos/bin/python scripts/run_all_syncs.py --execute --force  # Execute
```

### Debug Sync Issues

```bash
~/.venvs/lifeos/bin/python scripts/run_all_syncs.py --status
tail -50 logs/lifeos-api-error.log
```

### Manage Tasks

```bash
# Create a task
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/tasks \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"description": "Review Q4 report", "context": "Work", "tags": ["review"]}' | jq

# List open tasks
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/tasks?status=todo" | jq

# Complete a task
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8000/api/tasks/{id}/complete | jq
```

## Apple Data Agent (optional, macOS only)

If you have a Mac with iMessage/phone data, it can export Apple ecosystem data and sync it to the Linux server nightly via `scripts/apple_data_agent.sh`.

### macOS FDA (Full Disk Access)

`/Applications/LifeOS.app` is a bash-script-based .app bundle with **Full Disk Access**. macOS cron cannot access `~/Library/Messages/` without FDA, so the Apple Data Agent cron job routes through this wrapper.

If adding new cron jobs or scripts on macOS that need to access protected directories, route them through `LifeOS exec`.

### Monarch Money (Financial Data)

Auth uses a cached session token at `data/monarch_session.pickle`. Monthly sync runs on the 1st via `run_all_syncs.py` (phase 5). Live queries at `/api/monarch/*`.

Re-authenticate when token expires (401/525):
```bash
~/.venvs/lifeos/bin/python -c "
import asyncio
from monarchmoney import MonarchMoney
mm = MonarchMoney()
asyncio.run(mm.interactive_login())
mm.save_session('data/monarch_session.pickle')
print('Session saved!')
"
```

---

## Performance Tracing

Every chat request is traced with per-stage timing. Traces stored in SQLite (`data/perf_traces.db`), exposed via API. See [specs/technical/observability.md](docs/specs/technical/observability.md) for full details.

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/perf/stats | jq                    # Aggregate stats
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/perf/traces?limit=10" | jq        # Recent traces
curl http://localhost:8000/api/perf/traces/{trace_id} | jq        # Single trace
```

---

## Observability & Alerting

| Severity | When Sent | Examples |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| **CRITICAL** | Immediately (rate-limited) | ChromaDB down, embedding model failed, vault inaccessible |
| **WARNING** | Batched nightly (7 AM ET) | Ollama unavailable, backup failed, >5 degradation events |
| **INFO** | Log only | Telegram retry, config defaults used |

Set `LIFEOS_ALERT_EMAIL` in `.env` for alerts. Telegram backup via `telegram_bot_token` + `telegram_chat_id`.

Services are tracked on-use, not by polling. Degradation events (fallback usage) are collected and reported in the nightly health check if there are 5+ in 24 hours.

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Running uvicorn directly** → Use `./scripts/server.sh start`
2. **Forgetting to restart server after code changes** → Use `./scripts/server.sh restart`
3. **Committing without testing** → Use `./scripts/deploy.sh`
4. **Starting server on localhost only** → Must use 0.0.0.0 for Tailscale
5. **Overfitting to specific test cases** → Consider effects on the full system

---

## Documentation Rules (Quick Reference)

Full standards in [docs/AGENTS.md](docs/AGENTS.md). Key rules:

- **Product specs** describe WHAT (consumer view). Implementation details go in `specs/technical/`.
- **ADRs are immutable.** To change a decision, create a new ADR that supersedes.
- **Every doc** must have a Related Documents section with bidirectional links.
- **No task lists in specs.** Specs describe target state. Tasks go in `docs/plans/` or GitHub issues.
- **Synthetic data only** in all examples and test fixtures.
- **Completed plans** must be moved to `docs/plans/archive/`.
