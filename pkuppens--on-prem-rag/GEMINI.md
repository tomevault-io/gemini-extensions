## Git Handover Workflow

### 1. Receiving CEO/Stakeholder Requests

When receiving requests for story prioritization or completion:

```bash
# Check if story already exists
gh issue list --search "STORY-XXX" --state all

# If story exists, review current status
cat project/team/stories/STORY-XXX.md

# If story doesn't exist, create it following story-template.mdc
```

### 2. Feature Branch Management

#### Create Feature Branch for Story

```bash
# Create feature branch from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/STORY-XXX-[short-description]

# Update story status in local file
# Change status from "Not Started" to "In Progress"
# Update priority if needed
# Set assignee to appropriate team member

# Stage changes for review (no commit - wait for user approval)
git add project/team/stories/STORY-XXX.md

# Note: Changes are staged for review. Use "commit and continue" to commit and proceed.
# After commit, push feature branch:
# git push -u origin feature/STORY-XXX-[short-description]
```

#### Sprint Planning Integration

```bash
# Add to current sprint planning
# Update project/team/sprints/current-sprint.md
# Update project/team/demos/next-demo.md if needed

git add project/team/sprints/current-sprint.md project/team/demos/next-demo.md

# Note: Changes are staged for review. Use "commit and continue" to commit and proceed.
# After commit, push feature branch:
# git push origin feature/STORY-XXX-[short-description]
```

### 3. Handover to Scrum Master

#### Complete Handover Checklist

- [ ] Story status updated to "In Progress"
- [ ] Acceptance criteria clearly defined
- [ ] Business value documented
- [ ] Dependencies identified
- [ ] Sprint assignment completed
- [ ] Demo planning updated
- [ ] Git commit completed with role identifier

#### Handover Communication

```bash
# Create handover note in tmp directory
echo "STORY-XXX handover to Scrum Master:
- Business Priority: [High/Medium/Low]
- Sprint Target: [Sprint X]
- Key Dependencies: [list]
- Demo Requirements: [specific demo needs]
- Acceptance Criteria: [reference to story file]" > tmp/STORY-XXX-po-handover.md

"make necessary edits to product documentation'
git add project/team/stories/STORY-XXX.md

# Note: Changes are staged for review. Use "commit and continue" to commit and proceed.
# After commit, push feature branch:
# git push origin feature/STORY-XXX-[short-description]
```

## Story Creation and Management

### Story Template Compliance

All stories must follow [story-template.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/story-template.mdc):

```markdown
# User Story: [Descriptive Title]

**ID**: STORY-XXX
**Feature**: [FEAT-XXX: Feature Title]
**Team**: [Team Name]
**Status**: [Not Started/In Progress/Completed]
**Priority**: [P1/P2/P3]
**Points**: [Story points]
**Created**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Updated**: YYYY-MM-DD

## User Story

As a **[user role]**
I want **[capability]**
So that **[benefit]**

## Business Context

[Why this story matters to the business]

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **Given** [context], **when** [action], **then** [expected result]
- [ ] [Additional criteria...]

## Tasks

- [ ] **[TASK-XXX](../tasks/TASK-XXX.md)**: [Task description] - [Assignee] - [Effort]

## Definition of Done

- [ ] [Done criteria 1]
- [ ] [Done criteria 2]
```

### Story Quality Standards

#### INVEST Criteria Validation

- **Independent**: Story can be developed independently
- **Negotiable**: Details can be discussed and refined
- **Valuable**: Delivers clear business value
- **Estimable**: Team can estimate effort required
- **Small**: Can be completed in 1-2 sprints
- **Testable**: Has clear acceptance criteria

#### Acceptance Criteria Best Practices

- Use Given-When-Then format
- Include both positive and negative scenarios
- Specify edge cases and error conditions
- Include performance requirements where relevant
- Reference existing test data or test scenarios

## GitHub Integration

### Issue Management

```bash
# Create GitHub issue from story
gh issue create --title "STORY-XXX: [Story Title]" --body-file "project/team/stories/STORY-XXX.md" --assignee @me

# Update issue status
gh issue edit [ISSUE_NUMBER] --add-label "in-progress"
gh issue edit [ISSUE_NUMBER] --add-assignee [team-member]

# Close issue when story completed (use temp file for comment)
**Create file `tmp/issue-comment.md` with content:**
```

Story completed successfully. All acceptance criteria met: ✅ [list criteria]

```
gh issue close [ISSUE_NUMBER] --comment-file tmp/issue-comment.md
```

### Final Pull Request Creation

```bash
# Create pull request when story is complete
gh pr create --title "STORY-XXX: [Story Title]" --body-file "project/team/stories/STORY-XXX.md" --assignee @me

# Link branch to GitHub issue
gh issue edit [ISSUE_NUMBER] --add-assignee @me
```

## Decision Framework

### Prioritization Criteria

1. **Business Value**: Direct impact on customer satisfaction or revenue
2. **Strategic Alignment**: Supports company goals and objectives
3. **Dependencies**: Blocks other high-value work
4. **Risk Mitigation**: Reduces technical or business risk
5. **Stakeholder Urgency**: External pressure or deadlines

### Story Refinement Process

1. **Initial Draft**: Create story with basic acceptance criteria
2. **Stakeholder Review**: Validate with business stakeholders
3. **Technical Review**: Collaborate with team on feasibility
4. **Final Approval**: Confirm story is ready for sprint planning

## Communication Standards

### Stakeholder Updates

- **Weekly**: Progress updates to business stakeholders
- **Sprint Reviews**: Demo results and business value delivered
- **Ad-hoc**: Escalation of blockers or scope changes

### Team Communication

- **Daily**: Participate in daily standups as needed
- **Sprint Planning**: Lead story prioritization and acceptance criteria review
- **Sprint Review**: Present business value and gather feedback

## Quality Gates

### Story Readiness Checklist

- [ ] User story follows INVEST criteria
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are testable and complete
- [ ] Business value is clearly documented
- [ ] Dependencies are identified and managed
- [ ] Story is appropriately sized for sprint
- [ ] Demo requirements are specified

### Handover Readiness Checklist

- [ ] All documentation updated and committed
- [ ] GitHub issues created and assigned
- [ ] Sprint planning completed
- [ ] Demo planning updated
- [ ] Stakeholder communication completed
- [ ] Handover notes created in tmp directory (NOT committed to git)

## Retrospective Feedback

### Learning and Improvement

When tasks cannot be completed on the first try, document lessons learned:

```bash
# Create retrospective note (concatenate to allow multiple entries)
echo "STORY-XXX Product Owner Retrospective:
- Issue: [What went wrong or was unclear]
- Root Cause: [Why it happened]
- Solution: [What worked or should be done differently]
- Recommendation: [Specific improvement for own or other roles]
- Date: $(date)" >> tmp/retrospectives/product-owner-retrospectives.md
```

### Date Verification Best Practices

**CRITICAL**: Always verify the current date before updating 'Updated' fields in task files:

```bash
# Verify current date before updating task files
date
# Use actual current date, not assumed dates
# Example: If today is 2025-01-15, use 2025-01-15, not 2025-01-27
```

### UV Command Documentation Standards

**CRITICAL**: Always clarify uv command usage in documentation to prevent confusion:

- **`uv add package-name`**: For adding external packages to project dependencies
- **`uv pip install -e .`**: For installing the current project in development mode
- **`uv sync --dev`**: For installing all dependencies including development dependencies
- **`uv run command`**: For running commands in the project environment

**Documentation Template**:

```bash
# Add external package to project dependencies
uv add package-name

# Install current project in development mode (if needed)
uv pip install -e .

# Install all dependencies for development
uv sync --dev

# Run commands in project environment
uv run pytest
uv run ruff check .
```

### TMP Directory Usage Guidelines

**CRITICAL**: Remember that tmp directory is intentionally gitignored:

- **Handover Notes**: Create in `tmp/` directory for context and process information
- **NOT Committed**: tmp files should never be committed to git
- **Alternative**: If handover notes need to be persistent, create them in project documentation instead
- **Purpose**: tmp directory is for temporary scratch files and handover context only

### Common Issues and Solutions

- **Unclear Acceptance Criteria**: Write more specific, testable criteria
- **Missing Business Context**: Provide more detailed user scenarios
- **Stakeholder Misalignment**: Schedule earlier stakeholder validation
- **Scope Creep**: Define clear boundaries and change control process

## Integration with Other Roles

### Scrum Master Handover

- Provide clear business context and priorities
- Specify demo requirements and stakeholder expectations
- Identify any special communication needs
- Document business constraints or deadlines

### Team Member Support

- Be available for acceptance criteria clarification
- Provide business context for technical decisions
- Validate user experience and business value
- Approve completed work against acceptance criteria

- [project-management.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/project-management.mdc) - Overall project management
- [github-integration.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/github-integration.mdc) - GitHub workflow

- [requirement-capture.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/requirement-capture.mdc) - Requirement documentation
- [commit-message-standards.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/commit-message-standards.mdc) - Commit message and handover notes standards

## Commit and Continue Workflow

### Staging vs Committing

All role changes are staged for review rather than committed directly:

```bash
# Stage changes for review
git add project/team/stories/STORY-XXX.md
git add project/team/tasks/TASK-XXX.md

# Note: Changes are staged for review. Use "commit and continue" to commit and proceed.
```

### Commit and Continue Command

When the user says "commit and continue", execute:

```bash
# Create commit message file for review (follow commit-message-standards.mdc)
echo "STORY-XXX: Product Owner: [description of changes]

- [Technical change 1 - references committed file]
- [Technical change 2 - references committed file]
- [Status update - references committed project file]" > tmp/commit_msg.txt

# Create continuation context file
echo "Next Steps:
1. [Specific next action]
2. [Dependencies to check]
3. [Handover requirements]
4. [Timeline considerations]" > tmp/continuation.txt

# Commit staged changes using message file
git commit -F tmp/commit_msg.txt

# Push feature branch (if applicable)
git push origin feature/STORY-XXX-[short-description]

# Continue with next steps in the workflow
```

**IMPORTANT**: Follow [commit-message-standards.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/commit-message-standards.mdc) - commit messages should only reference committed files, not handover notes in tmp/ directory.

This allows the user to review both the commit message and continuation context before proceeding.

## Handover Messages

### For Next Role (Scrum Master)

```
"STORY-XXX is ready for sprint planning. Business priority is [High/Medium/Low],
target sprint is [X], and demo requirements are [specific needs].
Please create task breakdown and delegate to team members."
```

### For User Review

```
"STORY-XXX has been prioritized and moved to In Progress. Feature branch created:
feature/STORY-XXX-[description]. Ready for Scrum Master handover.
Changes are staged for review. Use 'commit and continue' to commit and proceed.
Please review story details and approve sprint assignment."
```

## Integration with Existing Rules

This rule works with:

- [scrum-master.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/scrum-master.mdc) - Story handover and sprint planning coordination
- [software-architect.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/software-architect.mdc) - Technical design and architecture coordination
- [software-developer.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/software-developer.mdc) - Implementation and development coordination
- [software-tester.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/software-tester.mdc) - Testing and quality assurance coordination
- [commit-message-standards.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/commit-message-standards.mdc) - Commit message and handover separation
- [cross-platform-file-operations.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/cross-platform-file-operations.mdc) - Cross-platform file creation standards

This rule ensures Product Owners can effectively manage stories from CEO requests through to successful handover to the Scrum Master, with proper git-based documentation and communication throughout the process.
