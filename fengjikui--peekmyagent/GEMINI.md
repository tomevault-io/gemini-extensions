# Coding Agent Collaboration Covenant

This file is the operational contract for coding agents working on peekMyAgent from macOS, Windows, or Linux. It applies to Codex, Claude Code, and any other automated contributor.

The words **MUST**, **SHOULD**, and **MAY** are normative.

## 1. Source Of Truth

- `origin/main` is the only shared source of truth.
- A local chat, handoff note, database, generated report, or unpushed commit is not shared project state.
- Every validation report MUST name an exact commit SHA. Do not report that "the latest code" passed.
- Read [the current architecture](docs/architecture.md), [the refactoring roadmap](docs/refactoring-roadmap.md), and the relevant source before changing behavior.
- Inspect current files and tests. Do not implement from an old conversation summary when the repository can answer the question.

## 2. Contributor Roles

### Primary contributor

Unless the project owner assigns a different lead, the Codex agent working from the owner's primary macOS workspace is the coordinating primary contributor. It coordinates architecture, sequencing, integration, and release readiness. This is a coordination role, not permanent ownership of every subsystem.

The primary contributor:

- keeps `main` coherent and the roadmap current;
- assigns an exact SHA and validation scope to platform agents;
- decides cross-module architecture after reviewing platform evidence;
- makes sure a platform fix becomes a portable regression test;
- does not overrule a reproducible platform failure merely because another platform passes.

### Platform contributor

A Windows, Linux, or macOS agent owns the quality of the platform it is currently validating. It MAY become the main contributor for a scoped feature or subsystem.

A platform contributor:

- validates the assigned SHA on a real machine;
- records OS version, architecture, shell, Node/npm versions, commands, and results;
- fixes failures on a dedicated branch rather than directly on `main`;
- prefers shared abstractions over platform-specific conditionals;
- reports a clean pass without creating an empty or report-only commit.

Responsibility follows the task and evidence, not a permanent hierarchy.

## 3. Synchronization Cadence

### Before every work session

Every coding agent MUST:

```bash
git fetch origin
git status --short --branch
git rev-parse HEAD
git rev-parse origin/main
```

- Start new work from the assigned SHA or current `origin/main`.
- If the working tree contains changes from another contributor, do not discard or overwrite them.
- Fetch again immediately before pushing or opening a pull request.

### Continuous automated validation

- Every pull request and every push to `main` or `codex/**` MUST run the GitHub Actions macOS, Windows, and Linux matrix.
- Hosted CI runs for every change. Do not batch CI until several large changes have accumulated.

### Real-machine validation

- Platform-sensitive changes SHOULD be validated on real Windows and Linux machines within one working day, and MUST be validated before a release.
- During active development, each real platform SHOULD run a checkpoint at least weekly even when no single change was classified as high risk.
- Every release candidate MUST be validated on the exact candidate SHA on macOS, Windows, and Linux.
- Documentation-only changes do not require an extra real-machine session beyond hosted CI.

## 4. Platform Risk Classification

Treat a change as **high platform risk** when it touches any of these areas:

- CLI parsing or wrapper lifecycle under `bin/`;
- process spawning, signals, shells, paths, environment variables, or permissions;
- installation, global npm commands, maintenance, or uninstall;
- ports, loopback binding, Capture Proxy, OTel, or daemon lifecycle;
- SQLite storage, file permissions, import/export, or cleanup;
- Agent configuration discovery or reversible patching;
- `package.json`, GitHub workflows, or platform release gates.

High-risk changes require:

1. focused deterministic smoke tests;
2. the full platform profile on the contributor's host;
3. hosted three-platform CI;
4. real-machine validation on affected platforms before release.

Viewer-only JavaScript, CSS, copy, or documentation changes still use hosted CI, but normally do not require immediate real-machine validation unless they alter browser, filesystem, or local API behavior.

## 5. Branch And Commit Rules

- Platform agents MUST work on a branch such as `codex/windows-<task>`, `codex/linux-<task>`, or `codex/macos-<task>`.
- Do not push directly to `main` from a validation machine.
- Keep each commit focused on one behavior, bug, or refactoring boundary.
- Do not mix formatting churn, generated artifacts, personal notes, or unrelated cleanup into a fix.
- Use semantic commit subjects that describe observable intent.
- Before committing, inspect `git diff`, `git status`, and the exact files being staged.
- Rebase or merge the current `origin/main` before final validation when the branch is stale. Never force-push over another contributor's work without explicit coordination.

## 6. Implementation Principles

- Preserve existing behavior unless the task explicitly changes it.
- Prefer current project patterns and shared helpers.
- Put platform differences behind `src/core/platform.mjs`, `paths.mjs`, `processes.mjs`, or another explicit platform boundary.
- Do not scatter `process.platform` checks through unrelated product code.
- A platform bug fix MUST include a deterministic regression test whenever the failure can be reproduced without real credentials or external services.
- Do not weaken, delete, or rewrite a failing test merely to make a platform pass.
- Data-source facts and heuristic inferences MUST remain distinguishable.
- Schema changes MUST use the migration mechanism once it exists; until then, do not change persisted schema without an explicit migration design.
- User-facing copy changes MUST update UI internationalization keys and both supported UI languages.
- Capture, translation, import, export, and Agent-send changes MUST be reviewed for privacy and local security boundaries.

## 7. Required Validation

Run the smallest focused checks while developing, then the platform profile before handoff:

```bash
npm install
npm run release:check:macos
npm run release:check:windows
npm run release:check:linux
```

Run only the profile matching the current host. The other profile commands can be listed from any host with their `:list` variants.

Real Agent tests belong to the [manual integration smoke matrix](docs/manual-integration-smoke-matrix.md). Use a non-sensitive test project and temporary state whenever possible.

When a real-machine test finds a stable invariant:

1. reduce it to a fake-command, fixture, or mock-upstream smoke;
2. add that smoke to the deterministic release gate;
3. rerun the three-platform CI matrix.

## 8. Platform Validation Handoff

Every requested validation SHOULD use this contract:

```text
Target SHA:
Platform and version:
Architecture:
Shell:
Node and npm versions:
Change summary:
Risk classification:
Required automated commands:
Required manual scenarios:
Expected behavior:
Sensitive-data restrictions:
```

Every result SHOULD report:

```text
Validated SHA:
Environment:
Commands and exit codes:
Manual scenarios:
Observed behavior:
Failures and evidence:
Files changed, if any:
Commit/PR, if any:
Residual risk:
```

Use a GitHub issue, pull request, or other shared tracker for this report. Do not rely on a private chat as the only handoff.

## 9. Failure And Conflict Handling

- A reproducible failure on one supported platform blocks release, even when other platforms pass.
- First classify a failure as product code, test isolation, external Agent/provider, local permissions, or machine configuration.
- Provider login/model failures are environment findings until product evidence proves otherwise.
- If platform agents propose conflicting fixes, prefer the solution that preserves one shared behavior and one tested abstraction.
- When uncertain, stop before destructive config or data changes and report the exact blocker.

## 10. Safety And Cleanup

- Never commit real captures, prompts, API keys, user source code, local paths, or unredacted screenshots.
- Never run destructive install/uninstall tests against a user's primary environment when an isolated HOME/state directory or test VM can be used.
- Clean assistant-created watches, captures, temp profiles, processes, and test sessions after validation.
- Do not expose the dashboard or Capture Proxy beyond loopback without an explicit security review.
- A public-repository self-hosted runner MUST NOT execute untrusted fork pull requests. Real machines may validate only trusted commits through an explicit/manual dispatch policy.

## 11. Documentation Discipline

- `docs/architecture.md` describes current behavior.
- `docs/refactoring-roadmap.md` describes intended evolution.
- Audit, experiment, and retrospective documents preserve evidence and reasoning.
- Do not present planned behavior as implemented behavior.
- Any feature, copy, API, schema, platform, or security change MUST update the corresponding documentation in the same pull request.
