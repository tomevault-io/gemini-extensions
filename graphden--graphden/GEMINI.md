## function-metadata-and-identity

> The single rule for WHERE a function's property lives — in the graph (default), a DB column (only when the graph can't serve it), and NEVER a name/prefix. Apply when adding/using any per-function property, classification, or metadata (visibility, kind, secret, anonymity, org, etc.), or when touching name-based dispatch/classification.


# Function metadata & identity — where a property lives

Graphden's premise is **code = graph**, and PHILOSOPHY §3 requires that
**behavior be visible in graph structure** (no magic, no context-dependent
semantics). That fixes where a function's properties must live. This rule is the
single conceptual key every metadata/classification decision follows.

## The rule (graph → field → never a name)

1. **Graph by default.** A function's SEMANTIC property is expressed in the
   graph itself — as **inheritance from a marker/base fn** (`parent-ids`),
   a **binding on a slot**, or the fn's **type**. It is then visible in
   structure, inherited, and needs no new DB column. The canonical precedent is
   **`secret`**: a fn is a secret because it inherits `:secret-leaf`
   (`parent-ids: [secret-leaf]`) — there is no `secret?` column. Classify by the
   graph relation (is `secret-leaf` in the parent closure, by **id**), never by
   name.
2. **A DB column only when the graph cannot serve it.** Add/keep a base-schema
   column ONLY for:
   - **Org-isolation enforced by RLS** — `org_id`. RLS operates on columns; the
     graph cannot enforce tenant isolation.
   - **Content-addressed identity / dedup the executor needs at O(1)** —
     `anonymous-hash` (are these two inline shapes identical?), `name = nil`
     (a local/unnamed fn). A parent-closure walk cannot answer these cheaply,
     and they are the fn's OWN identity, not domain metadata.
   - **VCS / lifecycle plumbing** — `branch-id`, `deleted-at`, `created-at`, the
     version-plane columns.
   A column that merely CACHES a structural fact (e.g. a type-kind) is allowed
   as a denormalized cache, but must be documented as derived-from-structure,
   never as the source of truth, and never a prefix.
3. **Never a name or a name-part.** Names are per-namespace LABELS
   (`docs/adr/ADR-identity-model.md`), not carriers of meaning. No code branches
   on a literal fn/package name or a name prefix (`_`, `_anon-`, …) to determine
   a property. Base-fn / seed *identity* may be resolved from its globally-unique
   name to its **id** ONCE at boot and then used by id (this is the ADR's
   name-keyed base-fn identity, e.g. resolving `secret-leaf` / `vault-get` → id);
   that is identity resolution, not per-fn classification.

## Verdict per current property (graph / column / fixed)

| Property | Where it lives | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| `secret` | **Graph** — inherit `:secret-leaf` | Already graph; the model to copy. Classify by id. |
| package **visibility / public interface** | **Graph** — a marker/export construct (TBD shape), NOT a prefix or column | Semantic; enforceable + structure-visible. Supersedes the earlier "namespace structure (visual)" idea in the packages spec. |
| anonymity — **composite-TYPE anon** (inline record shape) | **Column** — `name = nil` + `anonymous-hash` set (UNIQUE) | Content-dedup identity, O(1), hot path. Classify by the field. |
| anonymity — **composed anon fn-def** (inline `{:parent …}` lift) | **Identity in the synthetic `_anon-<hash>` NAME**; `anonymous-hash = NULL` | The name IS the content-addressed use-site identity (the hash embeds shape+host+ns; two use-sites get distinct names — `records-test/anon-use-site-identity-includes-namespace`). ADR name→identity, not a domain property in a prefix. Recognize an anon by `(or anonymous-hash (starts-with? name "_anon-"))` — the name half is IDENTITY. |
| local/unnamed fn | **Column** — `name = nil` | Identity representation; not a prefix (`_`-authoring syntax lowers to name=nil). |
| `org_id` | **Column** (+ RLS) | Isolation; cannot be graph. |
| type-kind (`role`) | **Column as derived-cache** of a structural fact (type-row = no impl + slots/refine) | Kept for classification speed; document as derived, never a prefix. |
| service / app-route | **Separate rows keyed by fn-id** (kept) | Carry runtime desired-state / a routing table; not fn-intrinsic metadata (see the domain-router decision — a routing table above the graph). |

## Name/prefix-hardcode audit + remediation status (2026-08-13)

Audit of the whole tree for "property encoded in a name/prefix." The dangerous
class (dispatch/identity/cache/classify by name) is otherwise clean + guarded
(ADR-identity-model + `id_resolution_guard_test`).

**Correction (verified against the live DB, not theory).** An earlier pass tried
to replace EVERY `_anon-` name check with an `:anonymous-hash`-field check on the
premise that the field is the single anonymity marker. That premise is FALSE.
`select` over `fn` shows two anonymity classes: composite-TYPE anons (name NULL,
`anonymous_hash` set) AND composed anon fn-defs (`_anon-<hash>` name,
`anonymous_hash` NULL — the majority). For the composed class the field is null,
so a field-only check silently stops recognizing them. Those "fixes" were
therefore REGRESSIONS (sync leftover-scan would flood with synthetic rows; the
type-picker would leak `_anon-` candidates) and were **reverted**. See the two
verdict-table anonymity rows: recognize an anon by `(or anonymous-hash
(starts-with? name "_anon-"))`; the name half is IDENTITY (ADR name→id), not the
forbidden "domain property in a prefix."

Genuinely landed (name-prefix classifier of a SEMANTIC/domain property, removed):
- `executor/composition/parsing.clj` `local-fn-name?` (matched `_` to infer a
  "local" property) — was **dead code** (no refs in src/test/resources) →
  deleted with its test + the now-unused `clojure.string` require. Committed
  (`refactor(parsing): drop dead local-fn-name?`). Verified: full unit suite +
  focused `composition.core-test` (5 tests) + `bb lint-clj` green.

Landed but JS (needs a Playwright check before it ships — not unit-covered):
- `editor/editor-secrets.js` `getSecretLeafFnId` — id-only (primed once from the
  seed's stable identity); removed the `fn.name === 'secret-leaf'` scan. This is
  a REAL fix (domain property `secret` classified by name → by id). Verify the
  Secrets panel still tags secrets before committing.

Reverted (were regressions — composed anons carry no `anonymous_hash`):
- `packages/sync.clj` leftover-scan `_anon-` exclusion — RESTORED (name check is
  load-bearing; composite-type anons are already excluded by the `(:name row)`
  guard, composed anons need the `_anon-` check).
- `dev/integrity.clj` `orphan-anons` — RESTORED to `(or anonymous-hash _anon-name)`.
- `crud/types_api.clj` `apply-types-candidates` + `editor/editor-fn-picker.js` —
  RESTORED (server/client exclude `_anon-` candidates by name; that is
  identity-based exclusion of un-referenceable synthetic fns, permitted).

**Left in place, justified (NOT prefix-property-encoding):**
- Resolving base-fn/seed *identity* by globally-unique name → id (`secret-leaf`
  prime, `vault-get` lookup, `types_api` `name-prefix` SEARCH input) — ADR
  name-keyed base-fn identity / user search, not classification.
- The `_anon-` name of composed anons — content-addressed use-site IDENTITY (see
  the verdict table). Recognizing anonymity via it is identity, not classification.
- `editor/editor-data.js` `displayLabel` strips a leading `_` for DISPLAY only
  of the `_`-private authoring convention — cosmetic; no behavior/identity
  depends on it. Eliminating it fully would mean either dropping the `_`
  readability convention (large) or a `visibility` graph property (the refactor
  below) — do it as part of that refactor, not as a special-case.

## Refactor direction (the work this rule sets up)

Move fn-metadata toward the graph where the verdict table says "Graph":
- Design a graph-native **visibility / public-interface** marker (following the
  `secret-leaf` inheritance precedent) and use it for the packages interface
  (replaces "namespace structure (visual)"). This ALSO retires the `_`-private
  convention's last cosmetic prefix use (displayLabel) by giving "private" a
  real graph representation.
- Do NOT move `anonymous-hash` / `org_id` / version-plane columns to the graph —
  the verdict table explains why.
- **DEFERRED (risky — do NOT bundle into cleanup):** unifying composed-anon
  anonymity onto the `anonymous_hash` field (so the `_anon-` name is pure label,
  not the anonymity signal). Blocked on real hazards: `anonymous_hash` carries a
  UNIQUE constraint (`schema/graph/schema.clj`) mirrored on the version plane
  (`fn_version`), and populating it for the majority of anon rows plus a prod
  backfill has a wide blast radius. It buys little — the name already gives these
  fns O(1) identity — so it is not worth the instability unless a future change
  independently needs it. If ever done: prove uniqueness across the shape+host
  hash space and the branch closure first, behind a rollback-tolerant migration.
- Any NEW per-fn property starts in the graph; a column requires a written
  justification against this rule.

## Acceptance
- No property is determined by a name or name-prefix anywhere in code.
- Each property's home matches the verdict table; new columns are justified.
- Classification is by graph relation (id/structure) or a documented
  derived-cache column — never a name.
