# bloub: notes for Claude

## Commands

```bash
pnpm dev       # 5190 (set in vite.config.ts, mirrored in .claude/launch.json)
pnpm test      # vitest
pnpm build     # vue-tsc --noEmit && vite build
```

Vue 3.5 + Vite 8 + TS strict + Tailwind 4 (`@tailwindcss/vite` plugin, no
`tailwind.config.js`), pnpm.

Style: 2 spaces, single quotes, **no semicolons**, comments in French. No ESLint
and no Prettier: `vue-tsc` is the only gate, so run `pnpm build` before
concluding.

## The most important rule

**The bot's numeric constants are measurements taken off the reference video, not
settings.** Gaze angles, eye sizes, radii, timings, colours: all of it comes from
frame-by-frame analysis. Don't round them, don't simplify them, don't replace them
with values that look tidier: it breaks the resemblance, which is the only
success criterion here.

The verified traps that must not be "corrected" are listed in
[docs/measurements.md](docs/measurements.md). Read it before touching a number in
`src/bot/`.

One deliberate exception: **`--ink` (`styles.css`) is the interface colour, chosen,
not measured**, a night blue. The video's black is the bot's, in `skins.ts`
(`encre`, `#0a0a0c`). Retouching one doesn't touch the other.

## Invariants worth knowing before editing

Details and the reasoning behind each are in [docs/](docs/):

- **`src/bot/` has no framework and no clock.** `engine.sample(t)` is a pure
  function of time. That's what makes `frozenAt`, the state board and the
  DOM-less tests work. No real-time state, no `Date.now()`, no Vue import. And
  **`sample()` must not mutate**: purging a stale previous state during playback
  makes the engine non-replayable (there's a dedicated test). Shared Vue code goes
  in `src/ui/`.
- **The montage holds or cuts, it never scales time** (`cycles.ts`). Hence
  `MIN_BLOCK` (0.6 s) and `StateDef.minDuration`, which is read off the state's
  `pose()` constants. Fill it in for any new narrative state.
- **All silhouettes share the same angular sampling** (`PROFILE_SAMPLES`), which is
  what makes morphing a linear interpolation of radii. A new shape must go through
  a radial profile, or `profileFromPolygon`.
- **The eyes are holes in a `<mask>`**, not white shapes on top. That's what makes
  them clip against the silhouette on their own.
- **Anything sitting "on" the body must follow its real radius**: `radiusAtAngle`
  (defined in `shape.ts`, applied by `engine.ts`) for the eyes and the notification
  pastille. A new element anchored to the outline needs the same treatment.
- **States declare `ArcSpec`; only the engine rasterises.** Don't call `arcRender`
  from `states.ts`.
- **Transitions are exponential ease-outs and the body never overshoots.** The one
  spring is the notification pop (`NOTIF_POP = 1.14`). There is deliberately no
  spring engine. A new bouncing effect belongs in the state that needs it.
- **Two sources of shapes, not to be mixed.** `profiles.ts` is generated from the
  video and drives the animated states; `skins.ts` holds the customiser's shapes,
  built analytically. A user's shape only replaces the body on `baseBody` states
  (`idle`, `wink`, `wide`, `notify`, `swirl`); elsewhere the silhouette IS the
  animation.
- **Among catalogue states only `idle` carries `baseFace: true`** (`swirl` does too,
  but it isn't in the catalogue). The other face states have an expression measured
  off the video. That's the point.
- **A tilt is only visible on an elongated eye.** `expressions.test.ts` enforces it:
  width/height outside `[0.6, 1.7]` for a tilt of 20°+, outside `[0.8, 1.25]` below.
  Already went wrong once.
- **Labels don't live in `src/bot/`.** The catalogues carry ids and the display
  resolves `t('states.orbit')`. Their ids are **literal unions** so the compiler
  checks that every entry has a label in all three languages. Adding a shape
  without its label doesn't compile. (`StateDef.hint` is a leftover French string
  nothing reads.)
- **One state isn't measured: `swirl`**, the settings view's entry transition. It's
  deliberately outside `SEQUENCE` (a test locks that) and carries both `baseBody`
  and `baseFace`.
- **`mediabunny` is the only dependency besides Vue, and it must stay a DYNAMIC import.**
  It encodes the cycle's MP4 (`src/ui/video.ts`). Imported statically it adds **43 kB gzip**
  to the initial bundle, more than the 34 kB that got `vue-i18n` rejected in favour of the
  in-house layer. Behind `await import(...)` it costs 0.7 kB and only arrives when someone
  exports a video. Turning it into a top-level import would silently undo that.
- **A UI element that must appear once uses a `transition`, not an `animation`.** An
  animation replays on every mount: every view change, every reload. A transition
  doesn't run on an element's first computed style, so it stays quiet there. That's
  why `.panneau` and `.barre-export` are built that way, and why the latter is
  mounted-but-hidden during the arrival rather than absent.
- **`Look` aims in ABSOLUTE terms on both axes, and the engine does the mixing**:
  only it knows the pose at instant t. `mix` and `wander` are distinct, and drift is
  added *after* the mix. **`setLook` refuses a non-finite target**: the engine keeps
  the last one, so a single `NaN` would settle in forever.

## Generated files

`src/bot/profiles.ts` is produced by `tools/extract-profiles.py` from the video's
frames (see [docs/measurements.md](docs/measurements.md)). Don't edit it by hand;
regenerate it.

`public/favicon.svg` is not an approximation: its circle and **both eye matrices**
are what `engine.sample(1)` returns for `idle`, byte for byte. `favicon.ico` and
`apple-touch-icon.png` are rasterised from it.

`docs/demo.gif` and `docs/states.png` are the same idea: rendered by walking
`engine.sample(t)` and writing the SVG layers in `BloubBot.vue`'s order, then
`rsvg-convert` + `ffmpeg`. They are **not** browser captures: the browser pane
suspends `requestAnimationFrame` when hidden, so an animation can't be captured
there at all. To redo them, drive the engine, don't reach for a screenshot.

Same pane, related trap: when it is hidden it also **clamps `setTimeout` to ~1 s**
and freezes CSS transitions. So no sub-second timing can be measured there: a poll
written at 40 ms actually fires at 1 s, which reads as a delay the code never had.
Assert on the *state* instead (a `MutationObserver` still fires; an
`animation-delay` of `-1.5s` samples an animation mid-way while it is frozen).

## Useful URLs

- `#planche`: the 14 states side by side, frozen. The only safe path: it doesn't
  depend on any montage.
- `#arrivee`: replays the arrival. It otherwise only plays on a genuine visit, so
  without this link you can't see it again in a session.
- `#etat=<id>&stop`: opens one state, playback paused. It looks the state up in the
  user's montages, which are all editable: if they've removed it everywhere, the
  link doesn't apply.
