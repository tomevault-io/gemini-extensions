# Agent Constitution — Chirp

Ordinary work: use this root map plus only scoped maps on the target path.
Do not open `.stewards/PROTOCOL.md` or `.stewards/manifest.toml` unless the task is an explicit review/audit or steward-network maintenance.

## Pillars

- Chirp is hypermedia-native: typed return values connect server-rendered HTML to browser behavior without a parallel SPA or JSON architecture.
- One template with named blocks serves full pages, htmx fragments, OOB updates, Suspense chunks, streaming HTML, and SSE payloads.
- The public `from chirp import ...` surface, AppConfig, CLI, docs, examples, scaffolds, tests, and changelog move together.
- Visible HTML corruption fails loud through rendering errors, app.check(), focused contract tests, and actionable diagnostics.
- Optional extras remain optional, and shared runtime state is frozen, request-scoped, single-owner, or explicitly lock-guarded for free-threaded Python.

## Search Discipline

- At task start, read the root map before repository discovery; never locate instructions by inventorying every AGENTS.md in the repository.
- Before reading or searching content beneath a path, open the nearest scoped map on that path; add another map only when the investigation crosses into its scope.
- If the request names an exact file and symbol or link, inspect that target before searching elsewhere.
- Search progressively: likely files, then filename or import discovery, then scoped content search; expand repository-wide only when scoped evidence fails or proves a cross-cutting dependency, and state the reason.
- Treat 10 commands or 12 content-exposed files as a strategy checkpoint, never as a hard stopping limit.
- For import, dependency, registration, or call-chain bugs, prove graph closure with a bounded static traversal: inspect ancestor package initializers, the target's module-level imports, and recursively only repository-local modules imported at module scope.
- During graph traversal, stop at function and class bodies, TYPE_CHECKING blocks, and classified external dependencies; inspect callers and tests only after the import graph closes and only to verify the named public entry point.
- Do not use repository-wide symbol, dependency, lockfile, documentation, or CI searches to establish import closure; a search budget cannot replace the bounded proof.

## Operating Rules

- Do not take, implement, close, or batch-plan issues labeled `good first issue` or titled `[GF]`; they are reserved for external contributors.
- The live GitHub issue graph is authoritative for active work, hierarchy, and blockers; roadmap prose, labels, markdown checklists, branches, and PR mentions do not replace native parent/sub-issue relationships.
- For maintainer selection use `scripts/backlog.py next` and `scripts/backlog.py explain N`; selection is read-only, `ready` is leaf-only, and every unblocked parent reaches a ready leaf.
- Backlog triggers retain their meaning: survey is read-only; next recommends; groom reconciles; cut decomposes into native sub-issues; reconcile verifies shipped behavior before closing.
- `ask stewards`, `bugbash`, `review swarm`, `steward synthesis`, `audit docs`, `content audit`, and `accuracy pass` are explicit review triggers: open the protocol, consult independent affected maps, preserve dissent, and synthesize with evidence.
- Behavioral issue closure needs `@pytest.mark.issue(N)` traceability or an explicit `Acceptance #N: n/a (<reason>)` receipt.
- Generated output under `site/public/` and `site/.bengal/` is not source-of-truth; edit source content/config and build or record a no-build rationale.
- Before finalizing agent-authored public files, remove customer names, private people or project names, private quotes, endpoints, and internal scale or cost figures.
- For htmx, OOB, Suspense, SSE, or shell failures, use Chirp DevTools (`debug=True`, Ctrl+Shift+D, `window.ChirpHtmxDebug`) before guessing.
- No silent except, unexplained type-ignore, vague error, speculative config, undocumented public behavior, or adjacent refactor unless it is the fix.

## Stop & Ask

- A change alters public API, return-type semantics, AppConfig, protocol shapes, CLI commands, scaffold defaults, optional extras, or compatibility tiers.
- A change touches render plans, return types, OOB or Suspense block discovery, ancestor pruning, or BlockNotFoundError propagation.
- A change alters app.check() severity or default contract semantics, security/auth payloads, cache keys, schema or migration output, lifecycle publication, or free-threading assumptions.
- A sync fast-path change lacks a measurement plan, a bug cannot be reproduced, or test and code disagree.
- When a public-contract change depends on unresolved product or API choices, identify only the minimum blocking decisions and stop before designing the API or its documentation, examples, scaffolds, benchmarks, and release collateral.
- An irreversible operation, deletion, external write, or maintainer-only backlog decision is required.

## Done Criteria

- Run `uv run ruff check .` and `uv run ruff format . --check` (or record a justified narrower docs-only check).
- Run `uv run ty check src/chirp/` when Python source or public typing changes.
- Run the narrowest relevant pytest targets first and `uv run pytest` for release-class changes; code coverage remains at least 80 percent.
- Hypermedia changes include realistic tests for htmx and plain requests, missing blocks, sync and async paths, malformed forms, environment posture, and optional dependencies where relevant.
- Public behavior moves with docs, examples, scaffolds/templates, benchmarks or no-impact rationale, and a changelog fragment when required.
- Every accepted steward finding names proof and collateral or an explicit no-impact reason; user-facing errors name the surface to fix.

Explicit review/audit only: [.stewards/PROTOCOL.md](.stewards/PROTOCOL.md). Steward maintenance only: [.stewards/manifest.toml](.stewards/manifest.toml), then `python .stewards/verify.py --coverage`.
