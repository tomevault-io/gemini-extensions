## Quality Gates

These tools are required for local development and CI. Keep this section aligned with `pyproject.toml`.

### Required commands

- `uv sync`
- `uv run ruff format src/`
- `uv run ruff check src/`
- `uv run ruff check --fix src/`
- `uv run ty check src/`

### Baseline lint and type expectations

- Use `ruff` as the source of truth for formatting and linting.
- Use `ty` as the source of truth for static typing.
- Use `uv` to run project tooling; do not suggest bare `ruff` or `ty` commands when `uv run ...` is available.
- **Treat `pyproject.toml` as the authoritative source for all enabled rules.** See `[tool.ruff.lint]` and `[tool.ty.rules]` sections.
- Before a PR or merge, run both `uv run ruff check src/` and `uv run ty check src/`.
- Do not weaken configured checks in examples, generated commands, CI snippets, or review advice unless the user explicitly asks for that change.
- When suggesting code, prefer patterns that satisfy the active async, security, import-order, and typing rules without needing ignores.


#### `ty` rule baseline (see [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml#L388))

**Blocking errors:** `unresolved-import`, `possibly-missing-attribute`, `possibly-missing-import`, `invalid-assignment`, `unresolved-reference`, `await-on-non-awaitable`, `non-awaitable-in-async-function`, `possibly-unbound-variable`, plus 9 additional production rules for class/function definitions.

**Key principles:**
- Account for Pydantic v2 dynamic attributes when evaluating `unresolved-attribute` (treated as warning, not error).
- Be strict about async correctness, especially around `asyncpg`, `motor`, Redis, database clients, and other awaitable I/O integrations.
- Prevent dataclass/protocol misuse, parameter default mismatches, and context manager violations (all error level).

#### `ruff` rule baseline (see [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml#L225))

**Core families (41 total):** `E`, `W`, `F`, `I`, `UP`, `B`, `A`, `C4`, `PERF`, `TRY`, `ASYNC`, `RUF`, `PL`, `ANN`, `S`, `SIM`, `PTH`, `TCH`, `RET`, `ARG`, plus `LOG`, `FAST`, `PT`, `T20`, `DTZ`, `BLE`, `PIE`, `ICN`, `FURB`, `N`, `SLF`, `EM`, `TD`, `COM`, `FBT`, `G`, `RSE`, `INP`.

**Key expectations:**
- Prefer safe autofix-oriented changes for `I`, `F401`, `UP`, `C4`, `SIM`, `PTH`, `RUF`, and type-checking import cleanup when applicable.
- Do not treat `B`, `ANN`, or `S` findings as safe autofix candidates; these require review.
- Respect configured ignores in `pyproject.toml` (e.g., `E501`, `ANN401`, `ISC001`, `TRY003`, `PLR0913`, `PLR2004`, `PLR0911`).
- `FAST` rules catch FastAPI antipatterns (redundant `response_model`, missing `Annotated` on dependencies).
- `N` rules enforce PEP 8 naming (mandatory for team consistency).
- `ASYNC` rules catch blocking calls in async functions (critical for your stack).
- `LOG` rules validate logging patterns (integrates with structured logging via loguru).

## Architecture Rules

### Layering

- Keep router handlers thin; push business logic into the service layer.
- Repository layer handles persistence only; no HTTP concerns.
- Shared clients/resources must be initialized in FastAPI lifespan and stored in `app.state`.
- Connection dependencies must read clients from `connection.app.state` as the single source of truth.
- Feature dependencies must compose repositories and services using `Depends(...)`, not globals.
- Prefer composition over inheritance. Reuse behavior by combining small collaborators, protocols, and helper functions instead of building deep or fragile class hierarchies.
- Prefer functions over classes when no instance state is required. Do not introduce classes that only group behavior without member variables.
- Use classes only for stateful components such as repositories or services that benefit from constructor injection and method grouping.
- Do not create classes that only group behavior without instance state.
- Do not create classes that only contain `@staticmethod` helpers; use modules to group related functions instead.

### Dependency passing

- Pass dependencies explicitly as function arguments.
- Do not create custom decorators only to inject config, clients, or runtime dependencies.
- When the same group of related dependencies is passed through multiple high-level call layers, prefer a small explicit context object instead of repeating long parameter lists.
- Context objects should be narrow and intentional. Prefer a `Pydantic` model for app/task/request context containers that group shared runtime services or metadata.
- Use context objects mainly at orchestration boundaries and other high-level functions to keep signatures readable. Low-level helpers and utility functions should still receive only the specific arguments they need.
- Do not turn context objects into god objects. Keep them focused on conceptually related configuration, runtime state, and shared dependencies.
- Context objects are still explicit dependency passing, not hidden injection. Access dependencies through the context only where the grouped shape improves clarity.
- When context fields represent behavior rather than concrete implementations, type them against `Protocol` interfaces where practical to reduce coupling and improve testability.
- Avoid tight coupling to concrete classes when behavior-based contracts are sufficient. Use `typing.Protocol` to define the minimum interface a function needs so compatible objects can be used interchangeably.

## FastAPI Rules

### Routers and endpoints

- Prefer router-level configuration such as `prefix`, `tags`, and shared dependencies on `APIRouter(...)` rather than repeating them at `include_router(...)` call sites.
- Use `APIResponse[T]` from `src/app/shared/response_type.py` as the default router response envelope.
- In routers, declare `response_model=APIResponse[T]` and return `http_response(...)` for a consistent envelope and ORJSON-backed responses.
- In FastAPI path operations, prefer `typing.Annotated` for parameters and dependencies such as `Path`, `Query`, `Header`, `Cookie`, `Body`, and `Depends(...)` so the Python type remains accurate and reusable outside FastAPI.
- When a FastAPI dependency is reused across multiple handlers, prefer creating a descriptive `Annotated` type alias instead of repeating `Depends(...)` inline in each signature.
- Do not use ellipsis (`...`) for required FastAPI parameters or Pydantic fields. Express required values through the type plus metadata, for example `Annotated[int, Query()]` or `Field(gt=0)`.
- Do not use `Pydantic RootModel` for FastAPI request or response shapes when regular type annotations plus `Annotated` metadata can express the schema directly.

### Dependencies and lifespan

- Use FastAPI dependencies when logic requires external resources, shared cross-endpoint behavior, cleanup via `yield`, sub-dependency composition, or request-derived inputs that do not belong in pure data validation.
- For dependencies with cleanup, use `yield`. Keep the default request scope when cleanup should happen after the response is sent; use `scope="function"` only when cleanup must finish before the response is sent.
- Avoid FastAPI class dependencies when a regular function dependency can return the needed instance more explicitly. Prefer function dependencies plus small returned objects or pydantic models.
- Lifespan wiring belongs in `src/app/lifecycle/lifespan.py`.

### Streaming

- For FastAPI streaming endpoints, prefer generator or async-generator path operations with declared return types instead of constructing and returning streaming response instances directly inside the handler.
- For JSON, SSE line style streaming, return an `AsyncIterable[...]` and `yield` typed items from the endpoint.
- For Server-Sent Events, use `response_class=EventSourceResponse` and `yield` typed objects for standard `data:` events; yield `ServerSentEvent` only when explicit control over `event`, `id`, `retry`, `comment`, or raw payload formatting is required.
- For byte streaming, declare `response_class=StreamingResponse` or a typed subclass on the route and `yield` bytes from the endpoint body.
- When a payload can become large or unbounded, prefer `StreamingResponse` with a generator or async generator instead of materializing the full response body in memory first.

### Middleware and exception handling

- Use `app.add_middleware(...)` for reusable or configurable middleware.
- Use `@app.middleware("http")` only for lightweight app-specific hooks.
- For hot-path middleware such as metrics, tracing, or auth context, prefer ASGI class middleware.
- Register one global exception handler in `src/app/main.py` via `app.add_exception_handler(Exception, global_exception_handler)`.
- Keep error response shape uniform: `success`, `statusCode`, `error`, `request`.

## Service and Repository Rules

- Service layer should use structured logging and typed project exceptions.
- Repository layer should focus on persistence and data access only.
- Use project exceptions such as `NotFoundException`, `ValidationException`, `UnauthorizedException`, and `ConflictException` instead of raw `HTTPException` in service/repository code.
- Use `logger.bind(...)` or otherwise structured logging patterns for service-layer logs, and prefer typed exceptions from `src/app/utils/exceptions.py`.
- Do not put HTTP response formatting inside repositories.



## Python and Typing Rules

### General Python style

- Public functions must declare return types.
- Prefer precise types over `Any`.
- Use generics when input and output types are coupled, such as envelopes, containers, repositories, or helper functions that preserve element type.
- For new generic code in Python 3.12+, prefer modern built-in typing and PEP 695 syntax when supported by project tooling: `type Alias[T] = ...`, `class Box[T]: ...`, `def first[T](items: list[T]) -> T`.
- Never use `TypeVar` unless explicitly required for backward compatibility with Python < 3.12.
- Prefer explicit imports; never use `from module import *`. Import explicit names so dependencies stay traceable and namespaces remain predictable.
- Prefer Python's strengths for collection processing and iteration. Use generator functions, generator expressions, and comprehensions when they simplify data flow without reducing readability.
- Do not override dunder methods in surprising ways, especially `__new__`, to return unrelated object types or hide factory logic. Use clear factory functions or explicit mappings instead.
- Do not use exceptions for normal control flow. Prefer explicit condition checks and branch logic; reserve exceptions for exceptional cases.
- Keep classes small and focused. Move complex methods out of the class into module-level functions or helper classes when they don't need state. Initializers (`__init__`) should only store parameters and set up simple invariants; they should not perform I/O, database access, or CPU-intensive computation. Delegate complex initialization logic to factory functions or class methods (e.g., `.from_config()`) instead.

### Properties and methods

- Use `@property` only for cheap, synchronous, side-effect-free state access or derived values.
- Use methods for operations with meaningful cost or side effects, especially I/O, database access, cache access, or network calls.
- Do not perform persistence or other side effects inside property setters; use explicit methods instead.
- Avoid async properties because they hide asynchronous cost behind attribute access.

## Async and Concurrency Rules

- All I/O code must be async.
- Always use async clients (`motor`, `asyncpg`, `redis.asyncio`, `neo4j`, async LangChain integrations) to avoid blocking the event loop.
- Prefer native `asyncio` for core concurrency.
- Use `asyncer` only to bridge blocking sync code in async flows.
- For bounded fan-out over a known, small in-memory task set, `asyncio.gather(...)` with a semaphore is acceptable.
- Do not use `asyncio.gather(...)` plus a semaphore as the default pattern for high-load, bursty, or unbounded work.
- For bursty or unbounded workloads, prefer a bounded `asyncio.Queue` with worker tasks to introduce backpressure.
- Choose queues when producers can outpace consumers, when input size is large or unbounded, or when task creation would add unnecessary memory or scheduling pressure.
- Choose direct `gather(...)` fan-out only when the work is short-lived, bounded, request-scoped, and operationally safe.

## Pydantic and DTO Rules

- DTOs should be lean and strict.
- Prefer `extra="forbid"` for request models.
- Use `default_factory` for mutable or dynamic defaults.
- Prefer `frozen=True` for read models where appropriate.
- Do not manually add field-level `__slots__ = ("id", "email", ...)` to `pydantic.BaseModel` subclasses as a default optimization pattern.
- Prefer Pydantic dataclasses over dataclass and TypedDict.
- When validating or serializing large collections with Pydantic, do not call `Model.model_validate(...)` repeatedly in a loop. Prefer a single `TypeAdapter` for the full collection shape, for example `TypeAdapter(list[UserResponse]).validate_python(users)`, to reduce per-item overhead.


## Logging, Errors, and Responses

- Use structured logging consistently.
- Keep logs contextual and machine-parseable.
- Use typed exceptions from `src/app/utils/exceptions.py`.


## Reference Map

Use these files as the first place to look before inventing a new pattern.

- Lifespan reference: `src/app/lifecycle/lifespan.py`
- Global exception handler: `src/app/middleware/global_exception_handler.py`
- Logging reference: `src/app/examples/logger_usage_example.py`
- Celery task reference: `src/app/examples/CELERY.md`
- Cache reference: `src/app/utils/cache/redis_func.py`
- API response envelope: `src/app/shared/response_type.py`
- Examples belong in: `src/app/examples`

## Tooling and External References

- Use Context7 MCP server when docs are version-sensitive, unclear, or likely changed.
- Ask for agent skill when required and available in `.github/skills` and `.github/agents`.
- Keep new guidance aligned with actual installed tools and repo layout.
