# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**livepaper** is a Linux desktop app (C# + Avalonia UI) that fetches live wallpapers from online sources and applies them using [mpvpaper](https://github.com/GhostNaN/mpvpaper). mpvpaper renders video wallpapers on Wayland by playing them with MPV behind all windows.

## System Dependencies

- `mpvpaper` — must be installed and on `$PATH`
- `mpv` — underlying player used by mpvpaper
- Wayland compositor (e.g. Hyprland, Sway, GNOME on Wayland)
- `.NET SDK` — for building
- `pactl` / `parec` (from `libpulse` on Arch) — PulseAudio/PipeWire CLI tools; required for Auto-Mute stream detection and audio level measurement
- `ffmpeg` — required for thumbnail extraction in the **Import Wallpaper** flow
- `wl-clipboard` — `wl-copy` is invoked by the Settings-tab keybind Copy buttons so snippets persist after livepaper exits. Falls back to Avalonia's clipboard if missing, but the clipboard releases the selection on app close (snippet only pasteable while livepaper is open).

## Common Commands

```bash
dotnet run --project src/livepaper                            # run the app
dotnet run --project src/livepaper -- --restore               # restore last session without opening UI
dotnet run --project src/livepaper -- --random                # apply a random library wallpaper without opening UI
dotnet build src/livepaper                                    # build (no solution file at repo root)
dotnet publish src/livepaper -r linux-x64 --self-contained    # single binary release
```

## CLI Flags

- `--restore` — re-applies the last session (single video, playlist, or random) without opening the UI. Useful for compositor autostart (e.g. `exec-once = livepaper --restore` in Hyprland). Always one-shot: for timed playlists it `setsid`-spawns `--timer-daemon` and returns immediately.
- `--random` — picks a random video from the library and applies it, then exits. Saves the picked video so `--restore` replays the same one.
- `--kill` — stops playback (kills mpvpaper and signals the timed playlist timer to stop), then exits.
- `--monitor` *(internal)* — starts `AudioMonitor` using saved settings and blocks indefinitely. Spawned automatically as a detached process when the app closes with AutoMute enabled; killed when the app reopens.
- `--timer-daemon` *(internal)* — owns the timed-playlist tick loop and blocks indefinitely. Spawned automatically as a detached process by `--restore` (timed-playlist case) and by the GUI on close; killed when the app reopens.
- `--action=<action>` — sends a command to the running session and exits. Intended for compositor keybinds. The Settings tab also exposes these as copy-paste keybind snippets, so the action set is duplicated with `--kill`/`--restore` for parity. Actions:
  - `toggle-mute` — toggle mpv mute
  - `toggle-pause` — pause/resume mpv playback AND the timed playlist timer (timer resumes with remaining time preserved)
  - `stop` — stop playback (alias of `--kill`)
  - `play` — relaunch the last session (alias of `--restore`)
  - `toggle-play` — stop if playing, otherwise relaunch the last session
  - `next-wallpaper` — advance to next wallpaper in history/playlist
  - `previous-wallpaper` — go back in wallpaper history
  - `random` — alias of `--random` (picks from active playlist if running, else from library)
  - `volume-up` / `volume-down` — adjust volume by 5 (clamped 0-100); persists to settings.json so the slider and next launch reflect the new value

## UI Structure

The app has three tabs:

### Browse Tab
- Source selector (pill-style) to switch between motionbgs.com, moewalls.com, Desktophut, and Wallpaper Engine local
- Grid of wallpaper cards (thumbnail + title); clicking a thumbnail opens a fullscreen preview modal
- Search box (enabled only for sources that support it)
- Refresh button and loading bar (thin strip below the top bar, no layout shift)
- Per-card "Download & Apply" downloads + applies that card only
- **Selection toolbar** docks at bottom when ≥1 card is selected (Shift-click / Ctrl-click / Ctrl+A): "N selected", `Download` (downloads all selected, no apply), `Cancel`

### Library Tab
- Grid of all downloaded wallpapers with circular badge in top-right: `+` to add to playlist, `−` to remove. Always visible.
- Per-card buttons act on that card only (no multi-select fan-out)
- "Import" button opens a file picker (`.mp4`/`.webm`/`.mov`/`.mkv`/`.avi`/`.gif`); a title-input modal then copies the video to the library and runs `ffmpeg` to extract a 320px-wide thumbnail at the 1-second mark. The `.id` sidecar holds `import:<source-path>` for re-import dedupe.
- "Play All" button with a "Shuffle" toggle — plays the entire library; rotation behaviour follows the global Settings → PLAYLIST panel (timer or advance-on-video-end)
- Per-card: Apply (sets as wallpaper) and Delete (removes from disk and library)
- **Selection toolbar** docks above the playlist strip when ≥1 card is selected: "N selected", `Add to Playlist`, `Remove from Playlist`, `Delete`, `Cancel`
- **Playlist strip** (always visible at bottom): horizontal row of small thumbnails; circular `−` badge always visible (matches library + badge); hover reveals dim + ▶ play overlay; drag to reorder; click plays that wallpaper
  - ⚙ opens settings popup (Sequential/Shuffle order; per-playlist `Override global rotation settings` checkbox unlocks per-playlist Interval and AdvanceOnVideoEnd)
  - 📂/💾 load/save named playlists (modals — text input with autocomplete for save, dropdown for load); playlists stored at `~/.local/share/livepaper/playlists/<name>.json`
  - ▶ Play starts the playlist
  - Playlist auto-state saved to `~/.config/livepaper/playlist_state.json` on every change (paths, order, override flag, current name)

### Settings Tab
- Playback: Loop, Mute audio, Disable cache, Volume slider (0–100, live via mpv IPC)
- Playlist (global rotation): Switch when video ends checkbox + Hours/Minutes/Seconds interval. Drives Play All and any playlist that doesn't have `Override global rotation settings` enabled.
- Auto-Mute: Mute when system audio plays + threshold/delay knobs
- Memory: Demuxer max bytes / back bytes (NumericUpDown, integer MiB)
- Rendering: Hardware decoding (auto / nvdec / vaapi / no)
- Wallpaper Engine: workshop folder picker + Copy files toggle
- Live mpv options preview; Reset to Defaults; copy-paste keybind snippets for `--action=…`

## Architecture

```
src/livepaper/
├── Models/         # WallpaperResult, WallpaperDetail, LibraryItem, AppSettings, LastSession
├── Scrapers/       # MotionBgsScraper, MoewallsScraper, WallpaperEngineScraper
├── Services/       # IBgsProvider interface + one service per source
├── Helpers/        # DownloadHelper, PlayerHelper, LibraryService, SettingsService
├── ViewModels/     # MVVM view models (CommunityToolkit.Mvvm)
└── Views/          # Avalonia XAML views
```

Each scraper is a static class handling HTTP + HTML parsing. Each service wraps a scraper and implements `IBgsProvider` for use by the UI.

## Wallpaper Sources

All HTTP requests must send a Firefox User-Agent:
```
Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:130.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/130.0
```

Use a single shared `HttpClient` instance (not one per request).

### motionbgs.com (HtmlAgilityPack)

**Listing:** `GET https://www.motionbgs.com/hx2/latest/{page}/`
- Parse `//a` tags: thumbnail from `.//img[src]` (prefer `data-cfsrc` over `src` for Cloudflare lazy-load), title from `.//span[@class='ttl']`, resolution from `.//span[@class='frm']`, page URL from `a[href]`
- Skip links where the path is empty, starts with `tag:`, or starts with `search` (filters out nav/brand links)

**Search:** `GET https://www.motionbgs.com/search?q={query}&page={page}`
- Site may redirect to a tag page (e.g. `/tag:car/`) — detect via final URL
- Tag pages: use `ParseLinks` (same as listing)
- Search results pages: parse `//div[contains(@class,'tmb')]` → `//a` tags
- Thumbnail: try `img[data-cfsrc]` → `img[src]` → `noscript > img[src]` (use explicit `if (string.IsNullOrEmpty)` checks, not `??` chains, because `GetAttributeValue` returns `""` not null)

**Individual page** (fetched before download):
- Preview video: `//source[@type='video/mp4'][src]`
- Download link: `//div[@class='download']//a[href]`

### moewalls.com (HtmlAgilityPack)

Plain HTTP with the Firefox User-Agent works — no browser automation needed.

**Listing:** `GET https://moewalls.com/page/{page}`
**Search:** `GET https://moewalls.com/page/{page}/?s={query}`
- Parse `//li[contains(@class,'g1-collection-item')]`
- Thumbnail: `.//img[src]`
- Title + page URL: `.//a[@class='g1-frame'][title, href]`

**Individual page** (fetched before download):
- Preview video: `//source[@type='video/mp4'][src]` — prefix with base URL if relative
- Download element: `//*[@id='moe-download']` (use `*` not `button` — element type changed)
- Download URL: `https://go.moewalls.com/download.php?video={data-url}`
- **Downloads require a `Referer` header** set to the wallpaper's page URL.

### Wallpaper Engine local

- Workshop path: `~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/workshop/content/431960/`
- Discovery is driven from each `<id>/project.json`:
  - Skip when `type` isn't `"video"` (filters out `scene`, `web`, `application`)
  - `file` field gives the actual video filename (any container mpv supports — `.mp4`, `.webm`, `.mov`, `.mkv`, …)
  - `title` field becomes the wallpaper title
- Thumbnail: `preview.jpg` or any `.gif`/`.png`/`.jpg`/`.jpeg` in the same directory

## File Naming & Library

Library storage: `~/.local/share/livepaper/library/`
Each entry stores: `{Title}.mp4` + `{Title}.jpg` (thumbnail) + `{Title}.id` (source URL for dedup).

The `.id` sidecar file contains the source page URL. On download, if a wallpaper with the same source URL already exists in the library, the download is skipped and the existing file is applied directly.

Config: `~/.config/livepaper/settings.json` — Cache: `~/.cache/livepaper/`

## Player

`PlayerHelper` is the single entry point for mpvpaper. It kills all existing mpvpaper processes before starting a new one. stdout/stderr are redirected and drained so mpvpaper output never corrupts the terminal.

**Single video:**
```
mpvpaper -o "<mpv-options>" '*' /path/to/wallpaper.mp4
```

**Playlist (Play All / Shuffle):**
- Writes all-but-last paths to `~/.cache/livepaper/playlist.txt`
- Passes last path as positional arg so all N videos appear exactly once
- Adds `--playlist=<file> --loop-playlist=inf` (and `--shuffle` if enabled) to mpv options
- Does NOT include `loop` (per-file loop) in playlist mode — mpv must advance to the next entry

`'*'` targets all Wayland outputs.

`PlayerHelper.SetMute(bool)` sends a `set_property mute` command via the mpv IPC socket (same Unix domain socket used by `SetVolume`).

## Auto-Mute (`AudioMonitor`)

`AudioMonitor.Start/Stop` is called by the ViewModel when `AutoMute` is toggled or its settings change. Three concurrent tasks:

1. **`WatchStreamsAsync`** — runs `pactl subscribe` and maintains a `ConcurrentDictionary<uint, CancellationTokenSource>` of per-stream monitors. On `'new'`: parses the stream ID from the event line, starts `parec` immediately, then verifies non-mpv after 100ms in a background task (cancels if mpv). On `'remove'`: cancels immediately. Initial reconciliation on startup. Filters out mpv streams (`application.process.binary = "mpv"` / `application.name = "mpv"`) and corked (paused) streams.

2. **`MonitorStreamAsync`** (one per non-mpv stream) — runs `parec --monitor-stream=<id> --format=float32le --channels=1 --rate=8000 --raw`, reads 160-sample chunks (20ms), computes peak dBFS. Calls `Interlocked.Increment/Decrement` on `_aboveThresholdCount` as the stream crosses the threshold. `finally` block always decrements if the stream was above threshold when cancelled.

3. **`WatchMuteAsync`** — polls `_aboveThresholdCount` every 20ms via `Task.Delay`. Counts consecutive ms above/below threshold; fires `PlayerHelper.SetMute` once the configured delay is exceeded.

**Critical invariant**: always use `--monitor-stream=<id>` targeting only specific non-mpv streams. Never use `@DEFAULT_MONITOR@` — it captures livepaper's own audio and causes oscillation (mute → silence → unmute → audio detected → mute...).

**`_aboveThresholdCount` reset**: done via `Interlocked.Exchange(..., 0)` at the top of `WatchStreamsAsync` (not in `Stop()`), so that stream monitor `finally` blocks from the previous run can decrement safely without racing against new monitors.

**Daemon persistence**: when the app closes with AutoMute enabled, `SpawnDetachedMonitor()` launches `livepaper --monitor` via `setsid` and writes its PID to `~/.config/livepaper/monitor.pid`. On next app open, `KillDetachedMonitor()` reads the PID file and kills the daemon before the app's own `AudioMonitor` takes over.

## Settings & Session Persistence

`AppSettings` (JSON at `~/.config/livepaper/settings.json`):
- Playback flags: `Loop`, `NoAudio`, `DisableCache`
- Memory: `DemuxerMaxBytes`, `DemuxerMaxBackBytes` (int, MiB)
- `HwDec`: `"auto"` | `"nvdec"` | `"vaapi"` | `"no"` (no cuda — deprecated on modern NVIDIA)
- Auto-mute: `AutoMute` (bool, default false), `AutoMuteDelayMs` (default 200), `AutoUnmuteDelayMs` (default 2000), `AutoMuteThresholdDb` (default -70.0)
- Global rotation: `GlobalIntervalSeconds` (default 1800), `GlobalAdvanceOnVideoEnd` (default false)
- Wallpaper Engine: `WallpaperEnginePath`, `WeCopyFiles`, `ResumeFromLast`
- `LastSession`: tracks the last applied mode for `--restore`

`CustomPlaylist` (JSON at `~/.config/livepaper/playlist_state.json` for in-progress, and per-name files in `~/.local/share/livepaper/playlists/`):
- `VideoPaths`, `Name` (nullable; only set after Save or Load)
- `Settings.Order` (Sequential/Shuffle), `Settings.OverrideGlobalSettings`, `Settings.IntervalSeconds`, `Settings.AdvanceOnVideoEnd`
- Per-playlist `IntervalSeconds`/`AdvanceOnVideoEnd` are only used when `OverrideGlobalSettings` is true; otherwise the global values apply.

`LastSession` model:
- `IsPlaylist` — was it a Play All session
- `IsTimedPlaylist` — was it a custom timed playlist session
- `IsRandom` — was it a `--random` session
- `Paths` — video path(s) used
- `Shuffle` — was shuffle enabled
- `TimedIntervalSeconds` — switching interval for timed playlist

`--restore` replays the session exactly: single video, playlist (with original paths + shuffle), timed playlist, or the specific video that `--random` picked.

**Timed playlist** (`PlayerHelper.ApplyTimedPlaylist`): `System.Threading.Timer` ticks every 100ms. Decrement uses real elapsed time (`DateTime.UtcNow` deltas) so jitter and pause windows don't drift the countdown. On shuffle, `AdvanceToNext` re-randomizes `_timedPaths` at the end of each cycle, with a do/while guarantee that the new cycle's first ≠ the old cycle's last. State at `~/.config/livepaper/timed_state.json` is only re-written on significant events (advance, pending action processed, pause/stop signals, settings update, graceful handoff) — not every tick — because the in-memory `_timedRemainingMs` is now authoritative.

**Tick state sync**: each tick calls `RefreshSignals()` (lighter than `LoadTimedState`) which only re-reads `TimerStopped` and `TimerPaused`. The owner's authoritative `_timedRemainingMs` / history are left alone.

**Pending-action IPC** (`~/.config/livepaper/pending_action.txt`): atomic write+rename file used by CLI mutators when a timed playlist is active. Single string content: `next` / `prev` / `random`. The timer owner's tick consumes it (read+delete) and dispatches to `AdvanceAndLaunch` / `StepBackAndLaunch` / `RandomAndLaunch`. All three call `LaunchAndReset`, which kills the current mpvpaper, launches the new one, and resets `_timedRemainingMs` to the full interval. This makes `--random` skip-to-random preserve a full interval before normal progression resumes.

**Stop/pause signals**: `TimedState` record includes `TimerStopped` and `TimerPaused` bool flags persisted to `timed_state.json`:
- `Stop()` → `KillAll()` (kills mpvpaper) + `SignalTimerStop()` (read-modify-write `TimerStopped=true`); the daemon's stopped-branch in `Tick()` also calls `KillCurrentProcess()` to cover the kill→launch race where the daemon launched a new mpvpaper after CLI's `KillAll`
- `TogglePause()` → sends `cycle pause` to mpv IPC + flips `TimerPaused` in state file; tick freezes the decrement while paused, resumes from where it left off on unpause
- `NextWallpaper()` / `PreviousWallpaper()` / `ApplyRandom()` write to `pending_action.txt` if a timed playlist is active; otherwise fall back to mpv's `playlist-next`/`playlist-prev` IPC (single video / Play All) or a one-shot library random pick

**Timer ownership**: at most one process owns the timer at a time.
- Daemon writes `timer.pid` (via `WriteTimerDaemonPid`); GUI writes `gui_timer.pid` on startup, deletes on close.
- `KillTimerDaemon()` kills any orphan daemon by PID file (called on GUI startup and inside `SpawnTimerDaemon`).
- `SpawnTimerDaemon()` bails if `IsGuiTimerAlive()` so `--restore` from a terminal can't spawn a competing daemon while the GUI is open.
- GUI's window-close handler clears `gui_timer.pid` *before* calling `SpawnTimerDaemon`, allowing the handoff.

**`IsTimedPlaylistActive()`**: state-file check (`Paths.Count > 0 && !TimerStopped`) used by `toggle-play` and the CLI mutators to decide whether to delegate via `pending_action.txt` or fall back to local execution. Survives the brief kill→launch gap where mpvpaper is momentarily down.

## Distribution

### Scripts (`scripts/`)
- `install.sh` — builds a self-contained single binary (`PublishSingleFile=true`), installs to `~/.local/bin/`, drops desktop entry in `~/.local/share/applications/`, installs icon to `~/.local/share/icons/hicolor/512x512/apps/`
- `build-appimage.sh` — same build, packages into `livepaper-x86_64.AppImage` using `appimagetool` (downloaded automatically if not in PATH)
- `PKGBUILD` + `.SRCINFO` — AUR package `livepaper-git`, published at `aur.archlinux.org/packages/livepaper-git`

When updating the AUR package, regenerate `.SRCINFO` and push to the separate AUR git repo:
```bash
cd scripts && makepkg --printsrcinfo > .SRCINFO
cp PKGBUILD .SRCINFO /tmp/aur-livepaper/
cd /tmp/aur-livepaper && git add PKGBUILD .SRCINFO && git commit -m "..." && git push
```

### Assets (`src/livepaper/Assets/`)
- `livepaper.svg` — source icon (monitor + play button, transparent background)
- `livepaper.png` — 512×512 PNG exported from SVG via `rsvg-convert`

To regenerate the PNG after editing the SVG:
```bash
rsvg-convert -w 512 -h 512 src/livepaper/Assets/livepaper.svg -o src/livepaper/Assets/livepaper.png
```

### Commit style
Short, title-case, no period. e.g. `Fix App Name`, `Add Shuffle Toggle`.

## Avalonia Gotchas

- **`NumericUpDown.Value` is `decimal?`** — binding to an `int` ViewModel property fails silently (the box appears but you can't type). Always use `decimal` for properties bound to `NumericUpDown`.
- **Drag-and-drop in Avalonia 12** uses a completely different API from older versions and most online examples: `DataFormat.CreateInProcessFormat<T>`, `DataTransferItem.Create`, `DataTransfer.Add`, `DragDrop.DoDragDropAsync`, and `DragEventArgs.DataTransfer` (not `.Data`). For reordering within the same control, manual pointer tracking (`PointerPressed`/`PointerMoved`/`PointerReleased` at window level) is simpler and gives full control over visual feedback.
- **Window-level pointer handler**: use `this.AddHandler(PointerPressedEvent, handler, RoutingStrategies.Bubble, handledEventsToo: true)` to catch all clicks including on buttons. Use `IsWithin(source, scrollViewer)` to scope which area the click belongs to, and `IsWithinButton(source, stopAt)` with a `stopAt` boundary to avoid walking past the target container.

## Key NuGet Packages

- `Avalonia`, `Avalonia.Desktop`, `Avalonia.Themes.Fluent` — UI framework
- `AsyncImageLoader.Avalonia` — `AdvancedImage` control for HTTP image loading (bind `Source` to a string URL)
- `CommunityToolkit.Mvvm` — `[ObservableProperty]`, `[RelayCommand]`, source generators
- `HtmlAgilityPack` — HTML parsing for scrapers
- `System.Text.Json` — JSON parsing for `project.json` and settings

## UI Styling

Catppuccin Mocha palette defined as `SolidColorBrush` resources in `App.axaml`:
- `BgBase` `#1e1e2e`, `BgMantle` `#181825`, `BgCrust` `#11111b`
- `Surface0/1/2`, `TextColor`, `Subtext`, `Muted`, `Accent` `#89b4fa`, `AccentFg`, `Danger` `#f38ba8`

Button classes: `.accent`, `.ghost`, `.danger`, `.backdrop` (modal overlay — no hover/press feedback).
Hover states use `/template/ ContentPresenter#PART_ContentPresenter` selectors.
Tab underline styled via `TabItem:selected /template/ Border#PART_SelectedPipe`.
