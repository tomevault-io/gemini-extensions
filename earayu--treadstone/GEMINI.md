## Skills

| Skill | When to use |
|-------|-------------|
| `dev-setup` | First-time environment setup (once per clone) |
| `dev-lifecycle` | Feature/fix: branch, TDD, ship, PR, merge; release via Actions; agreed codewords (合并代码 / 发版本 / 发生产); see skill |
| `database-migration` | Adding/modifying SQLAlchemy models and Alembic migrations |
| `neon-postgres` | Neon-specific questions (branching, connection methods, SDKs) |
| `system-audit-report` | First-pass or general subsystem audits grounded in the current code |
| `audit-report-refresh` | Re-auditing a subsystem and updating an existing report against the latest code |
| `architecture-data-flow-trace` | Tracing runtime architecture, state transitions, and end-to-end data flow |
| [`treadstone-public-docs`](.agents/skills/treadstone-public-docs/SKILL.md) | Public docs system, docs IA, manifest-driven delivery, `llms.txt` / sitemap / robots, control vs data plane narratives, dual human/agent quality |
| [`benchmark`](.agents/skills/benchmark/SKILL.md) | Run, design, or analyze sandbox benchmark / load tests in `tests/benchmark/` |

For Kubernetes deployment, use **`make local`**, **`make destroy-local`**, and **`make prod`** (context checks before Helm); details in [`deploy/README.md`](deploy/README.md).

## Code Conventions

- All code comments and commit messages in English. Docs default to Chinese in `docs/zh-CN/`.
- **All GitHub-public content must be in English**: commit messages, PR titles/bodies, Issue titles/bodies, review comments, release notes.
- Root-facing docs such as `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `.agents/skills/*/SKILL.md` should stay concise and easy for both humans and agents to scan.
- Async everywhere: all DB operations, HTTP calls, and API handlers must be async.
- TDD: write a failing test first, implement, verify it passes.
- DRY, YAGNI: no premature abstraction.
- All function signatures must have type hints.
- When adding or changing auth, admin, API key, sandbox lifecycle, browser hand-off, or other user-facing control-plane features, update Audit Log coverage and structured request logging in the same change.
- Ruff rules: E, F, I, UP (see `pyproject.toml`). Line width: 120.

## Error Handling

All API errors must return a consistent JSON envelope:

```json
{"error": {"code": "snake_case_code", "message": "Human-readable detail.", "status": 409}}
```

Rules:

- **Never raise bare `HTTPException`** — always use a `TreadstoneError` subclass from `treadstone/core/errors.py`.
- **Wrap every `session.commit()`** that can fail with a DB constraint (unique, FK, check) in `try/except IntegrityError`, rollback, and raise a domain-specific `TreadstoneError`.
- **Catch external-service failures** (K8s API, HTTP proxy) — convert them to `TreadstoneError` subclasses, never let raw `ConnectionError`, `TimeoutError`, etc. escape to the client.
- **Use the right HTTP status code**: 400 `BadRequestError` for invalid input, 404 `NotFoundError`, 409 `ConflictError` / `SandboxNameConflictError` for conflicts, 422 `ValidationError` for schema issues.
- **Global fallback handlers** in `main.py` catch `RequestValidationError` (422), `IntegrityError` (409), and `Exception` (500), guaranteeing the envelope format even for unexpected errors. Service-level handlers should still be preferred for domain-specific messages.
- **Always log before returning 5xx**: use `logger.exception(...)` so the stack trace is captured server-side, but never expose internal details to the client.

## Database

- Neon Serverless PostgreSQL. Connection string injected via `TREADSTONE_DATABASE_URL` env var.
- SQLAlchemy async engine + asyncpg driver.
- Alembic migrations (Alembic uses a sync URL — `env.py` strips `+asyncpg` automatically).
- All connection strings must include `?sslmode=require`.
- For local `make dev-api`, use `.env`. For Kubernetes deployment, use `.env.<ENV>` such as `.env.local`.
- For model design conventions and the migration workflow, see the `database-migration` skill.

## Testing

- pytest-asyncio with `asyncio_mode = "auto"` (no need for `@pytest.mark.asyncio`).
- API tests use `httpx.AsyncClient` + `ASGITransport` (no real server needed).
- Use `monkeypatch` for env vars in tests — never depend on `.env` files.
- Test directory structure:
  - `tests/unit/` — pure logic, no IO
  - `tests/api/` — API route tests via ASGITransport
  - `tests/integration/` — requires real DB, marked `@pytest.mark.integration`, excluded by default
  - `tests/e2e/**/*.hurl` — E2E tests against a deployed cluster, written in [Hurl](https://hurl.dev) (run with `make test-e2e`; see `tests/e2e/README.md`)
- Shared fixtures live in `tests/conftest.py`.
- `make test` excludes integration tests via pytest config; use `make test-integration` or `make test-all` when real DB coverage is needed.
- After `make local` (Kind cluster + deploy; see `deploy/README.md` for `kubectl` context and optional `TREADSTONE_PROD_CONTEXT`), run `make test-e2e` to validate the deployment. Prefer this over manual curl exploration.

## OpenAPI / SDK Generation

- Code-first: OpenAPI spec is auto-generated from FastAPI code. No static YAML to maintain.
- `make gen-openapi` exports `openapi.json` (full spec, including admin and audit routes for web types) and `openapi-public.json` (no `/v1/admin` or `/v1/audit`, for Python SDK; both gitignored). Runtime `/openapi.json` matches the public spec.
- All API routers must set `tags=["xxx"]` — SDK method names depend on tag + function name.
- **Reviewability:** API-facing changes often regenerate large, mechanical diffs. Prefer either:
  - **Two commits on the same branch:** (1) hand-written work — `treadstone/`, `tests/`, `web/` app code, `alembic/`, plus `web/src/api/schema.d.ts` from `make gen-web-types` when the web app needs new types; (2) `chore: regenerate Python SDK from OpenAPI` touching **`sdk/python/`** only via `make gen-sdk-python`. Or:
  - **One commit** if splitting is impractical — then state in the PR body that **`sdk/python/**` and `web/src/api/schema.d.ts` are generated only** (no manual edits in those paths), so reviewers can skim them.

## Git Workflow

- **Never push directly to main.** All merges go through Pull Requests.
- Conventional Commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `refactor:`.
- Commit frequently. Each commit should be one small logical unit.
- Never commit `.env`, secrets, or credentials.
- PRs and Issues are automatically added to the [Project Board](https://github.com/users/earayu/projects/5/views/1) by GitHub Actions.

## Release and deploy (agents)

**Agents must follow** [`.agents/skills/dev-lifecycle/SKILL.md`](.agents/skills/dev-lifecycle/SKILL.md) for:

- PRs, CI, merges, and `make ship`
- **Releases:** GitHub **Actions** → **Release** workflow → **Run workflow** with **version** `x.y.z` (no `v` prefix); wait for the Release workflow to finish
- Production deploy (`make prod`) and the **发生产** path (including Update Prod Image)

That skill is the single source of truth for step order and the agreed codewords (**合并代码**, **发版本**, **发生产**). Do not improvise a parallel release checklist.

**Guardrail:** Cut releases only via the **Release** workflow (`workflow_dispatch`). Do not hand-craft `git tag` / `git push origin v…` or `gh release create` unless fixing a broken release.

## Automation

- **pre-commit hook**: auto-runs `ruff format` + `ruff check` on every commit.
- **pre-push hook**: blocks direct push to main.
- **CI** (GitHub Actions): lint + test + openapi + build on pushes/PRs, plus integration on PRs. Any failure blocks merge.
- **CD** (`.github/workflows/cd.yml`): pushes the `main` image to GHCR on changes to deployable server files.
- **Release** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`): manual **Run workflow** with version `x.y.z`; bumps versions, tags, publishes images and GitHub Release assets. Agent steps: `dev-lifecycle` skill.
- **Update Prod Image** (`.github/workflows/update-prod-image.yml`): after Release succeeds, updates `values-prod.yaml` on `main`. Wait for this before **发生产** deploy; see `dev-lifecycle` skill.

## Cursor Cloud specific instructions

See [`.cursor/cursor-cloud.md`](.cursor/cursor-cloud.md) for the full guide. Key points: K8s is unavailable (cgroupv2 limitation); use `make test` + `make lint` locally and rely on GitHub Actions `K8s E2E` workflow for full-stack validation.
