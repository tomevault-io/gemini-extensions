# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Midtown is a multi-Claude Code workspace manager. It coordinates a Lead (human-facing Claude Code in a terminal session) and multiple autonomous Coworkers (headless Claude Code sessions), each running in isolated git worktrees. Communication happens through an IRC-style append-only channel log.

See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for a full architecture reference.

## Build & Development Commands

```bash
# Build & install
cargo build                     # debug build (daemon only)
cargo install --path .          # release build + install to ~/.cargo/bin/

# Test
cargo test                      # unit + non-ignored integration tests
cargo test <test_name>          # run a single test by name
cargo test --test daemon_e2e -- --ignored --test-threads=1  # E2E tests

# Lint (CI enforces -D warnings)
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo fmt --all -- --check

# Code coverage (requires: cargo install cargo-llvm-cov)
./scripts/coverage.sh           # HTML report → target/llvm-cov/html/
./scripts/coverage.sh --text    # text summary
./scripts/coverage.sh --open    # HTML report and open in browser

```

**Shared build cache (sccache)**: Midtown uses many worktrees simultaneously. sccache shares compiled dependency artifacts across all of them, so new worktrees build in ~15-30s instead of ~2-4min (only the `midtown` crate recompiles).

**One-time setup** (modifies `~/.cargo/config.toml`, which applies globally to all Rust projects on this machine):
```bash
cargo install sccache

# Add to ~/.cargo/config.toml:
# [build]
# rustc-wrapper = "sccache"
# [env]
# CARGO_INCREMENTAL = "0"
# SCCACHE_DIR = "/Users/<you>/.midtown/sccache"  # absolute path required (~ not expanded in TOML)

sccache --show-stats   # verify cache hits after a second build
```

**Test file placement**: Put unit tests in separate files (`src/daemon/pr_tests.rs`) rather than inline `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` blocks. Use `#[path = "pr_tests.rs"] #[cfg(test)] mod tests;` in the source file to maintain private access. This keeps PR diffs focused — reviewers can see how much is test vs. implementation at a glance. Integration/E2E tests go in `tests/` as usual.

**Pre-commit hooks** (cargo-husky): `cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy`, and `biome check` (web-app) run automatically on commit. If any check fails, the commit is rejected — fix before retrying. The biome check only runs when `web-app/node_modules` is installed, so pure Rust worktrees are unaffected.

**E2E tests** run with `--ignored`. CI uses `MIDTOWN_WEBHOOK_PORT=0` and `MIDTOWN_CHAT_MONITOR=0` to disable network features during testing.

**Containerized E2E tests** (canonical way to run E2E — reproducible environment):

```bash
# Using the CLI:
midtown e2e auth                            # one-time: authenticate for container testing
midtown e2e run coordination                # fast, no auth needed
midtown e2e run full                        # real Claude, needs auth setup first

# Or use the scripts directly:
./scripts/e2e-container.sh coordination
./scripts/e2e-container.sh full
```

**While waiting for GitHub CI**: After pushing a PR, don't wait idle for CI results. Run the full containerized E2E tests locally:

```bash
midtown e2e run coordination    # run while CI is in progress
```

This catches failures faster than waiting for GitHub Actions and keeps you productive. The container environment matches CI, so local passes should match remote passes.

**End-of-work cleanup**: run `cargo clean` after completing work to reclaim disk space from build artifacts.

## Daemon V2 Architecture

The daemon uses an event-sourced architecture (`src/daemon_v2/`). The v1 daemon has been removed. See [docs/v2-architecture.md](docs/v2-architecture.md) for the full architecture and [docs/v2-spec.md](docs/v2-spec.md) for the user-facing spec.

### Core pipeline

```
Command  →  executor (I/O)  →  DomainEvent(s)  →  update projections
   ↑                                                       |
   +──── decision functions read projections (immutable) ──+
```

### Decision functions are pure

Decision functions in `src/daemon_v2/decisions/` take `&Projections` and return `Vec<Command>`. No I/O, no mutation, no async. The executor in `src/daemon_v2/executor/` handles all side effects.

### Projections replace tick fields

V1 uses 50+ `tick_*` fields populated by `prepare_tick()`. V2 uses three auto-maintained projections:
- `AgentIndex` — agents by id/name/task/channel/thread, running set
- `WorkIndex` — tasks and PRs with pre-indexed views
- `ChannelIndex` — channel metadata and settings
- `CooldownTracker` — unified cooldown mechanism (replaces 10 ad-hoc ones)

### Nudge routing

All nudge routing goes through `chat::route_message()`. Rules:
1. Thread-bound agent gets thread replies. No thread binding → channel lead gets them.
2. Channel lead gets all top-level messages.
3. @mentions and !N task refs nudge the named/assigned agent.
4. **No running-state checks** — if the target is stopped, the executor resumes it.
5. Self-nudges are suppressed.

### Key conventions for v2

- **Routing is by binding, not agent type.** Don't check `AgentKind` in decision functions unless you're looking up the channel lead (`AgentIndex::channel_lead()`).
- **Cooldowns live on `Projections.cooldowns`**, checked in decisions (read-only), recorded by the daemon after command execution.
- **`AgentIndex::channel_lead(channel)`** is the shared way to find a channel's lead — don't duplicate this query.
- **`MAX_REVIEWER_RESTARTS`** is `pub(crate)` in `decisions/prs.rs` — import it in tests, don't redeclare.

## General Conventions

**Temp-file pattern for shell arguments**: When passing long text to the `claude` CLI (system prompts, initial prompts), write to a temp file and use `$(cat file)` in the command string. This avoids shell quoting issues. See `launch.rs`.

## Session Taxonomy

Three session types, each bound to exactly one thing:

- **Lead** → bound to a **channel**. Named after the channel. Agent type: `midtown-channel-lead` (or `midtown-project-lead` for main).
- **Fork** → bound to a **thread**. Named by the lead's `--name` flag (slugify fallback). Agent type: `midtown-channel-lead`.
- **Worker** → bound to a **task**. Named by the task's `agent_name`. Agent type from the task's `agent_type` field.

**Invariants:**
- One-to-one mapping between tasks and worker sessions.
- Forks never have tasks — they are thread-bound research sessions.
- `agent_type` refers to the agent definition passed to `--agent` (e.g., `midtown-code-author`). It is NOT the session name.
- `agent_name` is the creative session name (e.g., `ghost-town`). It is NOT the agent definition.

## Session Architecture

**SessionRecord is the single source of truth** for all session state. There are no parallel in-memory maps for thread bindings, channel bindings, or fork tracking.

**Two session types, one model:**
- **Lead/Worker sessions** have `bound_thread_id: None` (or set for task-thread routing).
- **Fork sessions** have `bound_thread_id: Some(thread_id)` AND `agent_type: "midtown-channel-lead"`. Detected via `SessionRecord::is_fork_session()`.

**No parallel state:**
- Thread routing (`session_by_thread()`) queries SessionRecord directly.
- Output binding (auto-tagging posts with `thread_parent_id`) reads `SessionRecord.bound_thread_id`.
- Fork channel routing reads `SessionRecord.channel` filtered by `is_fork_session()`.
- `pending_forks: HashSet<String>` guards concurrent fork creation (replaces the old "pending" sentinel).

**Dead forks stay dead (v1).** When a fork session's process exits, its `SessionRecord.is_running` is set to `false`. There is no auto-respawn. Thread replies to dead forks fall through to the channel lead.

**V2 resumes dead forks.** In the v2 daemon, thread bindings persist through agent stop events. When a thread reply targets a stopped fork, `NudgeAgent` triggers the executor to resume it. The `AgentIndex.by_thread` index is only cleared on garbage collection, not on stop.

## Keeping docs/architecture.md Up-to-Date

`docs/architecture.md` is the living reference for how the codebase works. Keep it current:

- **When exploring the codebase** (using the Explore agent or deep code reads), capture what you learn in `docs/architecture.md`. If a module's behavior, data flow, or key invariant isn't documented there yet, add it.
- **When reviewing PRs**, check whether the changes should be reflected in `docs/architecture.md`. New modules, changed data flows, new state fields, and altered decision logic should all be documented.

## Keeping README.md Up-to-Date

When your changes affect anything documented in README.md, update the README as part of the same PR. This includes:

- **New CLI commands or subcommands** — add usage examples to the relevant section
- **Changed CLI interfaces** — update command syntax, flags, or options
- **New features** — add a section or update an existing one (e.g., new daemon capabilities, web UI features)
- **Architecture changes** — update the "How It Works" section if the system design changes
- **Configuration changes** — update config examples if new settings are added or existing ones change
- **Removed or renamed functionality** — remove or update stale references

The README is the first thing new users and contributors see. If your PR changes user-facing behavior, the README should reflect it.

## Web App (PWA) Guidelines

The web app runs as a PWA on mobile devices. When modifying layout or adding new UI sections:

- **Always account for `safe-area-inset-*`** — iOS PWAs have a status bar/notch that overlaps content. Use `env(safe-area-inset-top)`, `env(safe-area-inset-bottom)`, etc. for any element positioned at the edges of the viewport. Forgetting this causes content to be cut off on mobile.
- **Test vertical space** — Mobile viewports are constrained. Avoid adding headings, padding, or chrome that pushes primary content (chat, status) off-screen.

## Pull Requests

- When a PR includes visual changes to the web UI (`web-app/` or `web/`), include before/after screenshots in the PR description. Use the Playwright MCP tools to capture them:
  1. `browser_navigate` to the relevant page, then `browser_screenshot` to capture the before/after states
  2. `midtown agent upload-image <path>` to get a GitHub-embeddable URL
  3. Embed the returned markdown image URL in the PR body
- **Check code coverage before opening a PR.** Run `./scripts/coverage-diff.sh` to generate a branch-based coverage diff. This shows coverage only for lines changed relative to `origin/main` and prints a summary to the terminal. Review the summary for uncovered lines in your changed files. New code should have reasonable coverage — if a function is untestable at the unit level (e.g., async functions requiring full `DaemonState`), note it in the PR description. Prerequisites: `cargo install cargo-llvm-cov` and `pip install diff-cover`.
