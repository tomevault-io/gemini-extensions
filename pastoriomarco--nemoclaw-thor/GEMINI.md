## Cross-repo authority map (start here)

The ManyForge stack spans three sibling repos. Each owns a different
question. Land in the right one before making a change:

| Question | Authoritative repo | AGENTS.md |
|---|---|---|
| **What is the contract / spec / ADR?** ("what should this do?") | `dev_ws/src/manyforge_specs/` | `manyforge_specs/AGENTS.md` |
| **What's in the implementation code / tests?** ("how is it written today?") | `dev_ws/src/manyforge/` | `manyforge/AGENTS.md` (one-page redirect to `manyforge_specs`) |
| **How does it run on Thor — serving, sandbox, integration?** ("how do we deploy and operate?") | this repo (`NemoClaw-Thor/`) | this file, plus the integration subtree's own [`manyforge/AGENTS.md`](manyforge/AGENTS.md) |

If your change spans repos (most do): start at
`manyforge_specs/AGENTS.md`, walk down to `dev_ws/src/manyforge/`, then
back here for the runtime artifacts. Don't write spec-level content
in this repo; it belongs upstream in `manyforge_specs`.

The Composer-assistant production default (lane + model) and the
runbook for bringing it up live in this repo at
[`manyforge/README.md`](manyforge/README.md) and
[`manyforge/docs/COMPOSER-ASSISTANT-RUNBOOK.md`](manyforge/docs/COMPOSER-ASSISTANT-RUNBOOK.md).

## Purpose

This repository provides a tested, reproducible setup for running
**NemoClaw** on **Jetson AGX Thor (SM110)** with local LLM inference, in
service of the **ManyForge assistant pipeline**.

It scopes to two concerns:

1. **NemoClaw onboarding on Thor** — a documented (ideally LLM-assisted)
   path from a clean Thor host to a working sandbox running OpenClaw or
   Hermes against a local vLLM endpoint.
2. **LLM serving for NemoClaw** — Thor-tuned vLLM and TRT-Edge-LLM
   container builds, model profiles, and launch scripts that expose an
   OpenAI-compatible `/v1` endpoint consumable by NemoClaw and (downstream)
   ManyForge.

The downstream consumer is the ManyForge composer running an assistant
agent backed by these models. This repo hosts the **deployment-side
integration runbook** that wires the OpenClaw runtime in a NemoClaw
sandbox to ManyForge's MCP surfaces (egress preset, skill bundle, MCP
server registration); see "ManyForge integration" below.

There are two assistant-provider bridges, both implementing ManyForge's
provider HTTP contract:

- **Direct vLLM lane** — `manyforge_assistant_bridge` on `:8100`, lives
  in the ManyForge repo. Talks straight to vLLM, runs the agent loop
  in-process. This repo does not own it.
- **OpenClaw lane** — `openclaw_assistant_bridge` on `:8200`, lives in
  this repo at [`manyforge/openclaw_assistant_bridge/`](manyforge/openclaw_assistant_bridge/).
  Adapter that dispatches into the NemoClaw `my-assistant` sandbox
  running OpenClaw, which runs the agent loop and calls vLLM through
  the OpenClaw gateway. **Production default since 2026-05-07.** This
  repo does own it.

---

## What this repo owns vs consumes

**Owns** (edit freely, version in this repo):

- `setup/` — sandbox/control-plane scope: prerequisite checks
  (`checks.sh`), sandbox runtime helpers (`sandbox-runtime.sh`), the
  local-provider configuration entrypoint (`configure-local-provider.sh`),
  the system-health entrypoint (`status.sh`), egress policies under
  `setup/policies/`, and the canonical onboarding workflow doc
  `setup/NEMOCLAW-OPENCLAW-WORKFLOW.md`.
- `serving/` — model-serving scope: vLLM model profile registry
  (`config.sh`), launch-arg matrix (`launch.sh`), entry points
  (`start-model.sh`, `start-duo.sh`), the Thor-specific Dockerfiles and
  runtime patches under `serving/docker/`, the agentic benchmark harness
  under `serving/agentic-bench/`, loose perf probes under
  `serving/benchmarks/`, and per-scope investigation/perf docs under
  `serving/docs/`.
- `manyforge/` — ManyForge integration scope: the deployment-side
  provisioner (`setup-manyforge-assistant.sh`), the egress preset
  (`policies/manyforge-composer.preset.yaml`), the OpenClaw-lane
  assistant-provider adapter (`openclaw_assistant_bridge/`, port
  `:8200`, production default), the bridge audit-log mount point
  (`bridge/`), and integration docs under `manyforge/docs/`.
- Top-level docs: `README.md`, this file (`AGENTS.md`), `VERSIONS.md`
  (single source of truth for verified versions across all three
  scopes), and `USER_QUICKSTART_MANUAL.md`.

This repo does **not** own the **direct-vLLM** assistant-provider
bridge service (`manyforge_assistant_bridge`). That bridge implements
ManyForge's HTTP contract and lives in the ManyForge repo
(`manyforge/manyforge_assistant_bridge/`); it consumes the vLLM
endpoint this repo's launch scripts expose. The bridge's architectural
design lives alongside the contract in
`manyforge_specs/docs/spec/485-assistant-bridge-architecture.md`.

This repo **does** own the **OpenClaw-lane** adapter
(`openclaw_assistant_bridge` at `:8200`) that implements the same
provider contract by forwarding into a NemoClaw sandbox running
OpenClaw — see the `manyforge/` ownership entry above. Both bridges
speak the same wire envelope; selection is via Composer's
`ASSISTANT_PROVIDER` env var, and `openclaw` is the production
default since 2026-05-07.

**Consumes** (don't reimplement; don't fork; configure and wrap):

- **NemoClaw** (`NVIDIA/NemoClaw`) — host CLI + sandbox onboarding.
- **OpenShell** (`NVIDIA/OpenShell`) — host CLI + cluster gateway
  container providing the k3s + sandbox runtime.
- **OpenClaw** (`openclaw/openclaw`) — in-sandbox coding agent.
- **Hermes Agent** (`NousResearch/hermes-agent`) — alternative
  in-sandbox agent (NemoClaw added support pre-v0.0.18; status: viable
  but bumpy — prefer OpenClaw for production today).
- **vLLM**, **TRT-Edge-LLM**, **HuggingFace models** — upstream binaries.

**Sibling workspaces** (read-but-don't-edit boundaries; cross-cutting
work happens via the coordination protocol in
`manyforge_specs/docs/cross-workspace-conventions.md`):

- **`manyforge`** at `dev_ws/src/manyforge/` — ManyForge composer +
  behavior runtime + assistant-provider HTTP contract code +
  `manyforge_assistant_bridge/` runtime service. The wire shape and
  runtime services for the assistant pipeline live there, not here.
- **`manyforge_specs`** at `dev_ws/src/manyforge_specs/` —
  architectural specs + ADRs + contract specifications. Normative for
  both this repo and `manyforge`. When a behaviour question crosses
  workspace boundaries, the spec layer is the tie-breaker.

This repo's role in the trio is the **deployment helper** layer:
hardware-specific build/launch/onboard scripts and Thor-tuned model
profiles. It does not own the ManyForge contract, the bridge
implementation, or any runtime service that fulfils the
assistant-provider contract.

## Scope shift — 2026-04 reboot, do not regress

In v1–v3 this repo overrode large parts of NemoClaw config to force
agentic workflow interaction. **v4 (2026-04-06)** rebooted to the
current scope. The override approach is gone and stays gone.

Concretely:

- **Don't** re-add a restream proxy. NemoClaw + OpenShell L7 proxy
  handle routing now.
- **Don't** patch NemoClaw's npm sources. If a feature is missing,
  file an upstream issue; if a bug bites us, document the *workaround*
  (not a fix) and check upstream for a release.
- **Don't** write scripts to bypass `nemoclaw onboard`. Onboarding can
  require manual intervention (license acceptance, HF token, device
  attestation) — that's acceptable.
- **Do** keep our wrappers thin and our docs explicit. The ratio of
  `# explanation` to `command` in our shell scripts is intentional.

**Verified working version pins** for all three repo scopes (setup,
serving, ManyForge integration) live in [`VERSIONS.md`](VERSIONS.md). That
is the single source of truth — update it on each tested upgrade rather
than duplicating tables here. The setup-scope onboarding workflow detail
lives in `setup/NEMOCLAW-OPENCLAW-WORKFLOW.md` (post-restructure path).

---

## Workflows by intent

### A — First-time NemoClaw onboarding on a clean Thor

Manual steps (these stay manual; do not script around them):

1. Install Docker, accept NVIDIA runtime prompts.
2. Install Node.js + the `nemoclaw` and `openshell` CLIs. Pin to the
   verified versions above unless explicitly upgrading. The
   NemoClaw repo ships `scripts/install-openshell.sh` which handles the
   OpenShell CLI bump within the supported version range.
3. Save HF token to `~/.cache/huggingface/token` for gated repos.
4. Accept gated-model licenses on huggingface.co for the profiles you
   intend to use.
5. Pre-pull model weights with `hf download <repo>` — vLLM cold starts
   faster from a populated cache.
6. Start the model first (`./serving/start-model.sh <profile>`), then run
   `nemoclaw onboard` — the onboarding wizard probes the inference
   endpoint as part of step 3/8.

When NemoClaw's onboarding wizard hangs or fails on a specific step,
the answer is to upgrade NemoClaw upstream rather than work around it.
Most onboarding regressions are fixed within 1–2 monthly NemoClaw
releases.

The detailed wizard walkthrough — exact prompt answers that produce a
working `my-assistant` sandbox on Thor (inference option, base URL,
served-model name, sandbox name, web-search/messaging skip, policy tier
choice, minimum-egress preset selection, dashboard token handling) —
lives in [NEMOCLAW-OPENCLAW-WORKFLOW.md](setup/NEMOCLAW-OPENCLAW-WORKFLOW.md)
under "First-time NemoClaw onboard recipe". Read it before running
`nemoclaw onboard` on a clean Thor.

### B — Per-session: serve a model and wire NemoClaw to it

```bash
cd ${HOME}/workspaces/nemoclaw/src/NemoClaw-Thor

# 1. Start the model (one of the profiles in serving/config.sh)
./serving/start-model.sh <profile-slug>

# 2. Wire OpenShell to route the sandbox at it
./setup/configure-local-provider.sh <profile-slug>

# 3. Use it (interactive)
nemoclaw <sandbox-name> connect

# Or scripted — see NEMOCLAW-OPENCLAW-WORKFLOW.md "Scripted / non-interactive"
```

**Naming invariant.** The served-model-name advertised by vLLM equals
the profile slug. A consumer (ManyForge, OpenShell route, BFCL, etc.)
only needs to know the slug. The mechanism lives in `serving/config.sh`'s
case-statement branches and `serving/launch.sh`'s `--served-model-name`
flag construction.

### C — End-of-session cleanup

```bash
docker stop <vllm-container-name>
sync && sudo sh -c 'echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches'
free -g     # should report ~110+ GB available
```

The `drop_caches` step is part of the Thor memory protocol — vLLM can
leave unified-memory pages pinned after a stop or crash.

### D — Bench candidates

See `serving/agentic-bench/README.md` for the harness, current candidate
shortlist, and bench-menu rationale.

## ManyForge assistant pipeline integration

ManyForge is the downstream consumer of this repo's serving stack.
The integration has three pieces:

1. **Model serving** — owned by this repo (`serving/`). Production
   default profile: `cosmos-reason2-8b`.
2. **Sandbox + agent runtime** — onboard and configure via the
   workflows above; provision the Composer-assistant skill +
   policy + MCP server via `manyforge/setup-manyforge-assistant.sh`.
3. **Bridge service** that translates ManyForge's
   `manyforge.assistant.provider_request.v0` envelope into a model
   dispatch (and back). **Two implementations exist:**
   - `openclaw_assistant_bridge` (port 8200) — production default
     lane. Ships in `dev_ws/src/manyforge/`. Routes through the
     in-sandbox OpenClaw gateway and the manyforge MCP bridge.
   - `manyforge_assistant_bridge` (port 8100) — fast-path / sandbox
     bypass. Ships in `dev_ws/src/manyforge/`. Runs its own agent
     loop with a `tool_choice` pin and an inline-snapshot context
     for compound prompts.

To bring up the production default after a reboot, run the four
commands in `README.md § ManyForge Composer-assistant`. The
runbook for debugging each gate of the request chain is
`manyforge/docs/COMPOSER-ASSISTANT-RUNBOOK.md`. The benchmark
that drove the production-default choice (Cosmos-Reason2-8B over
Qwen3.6 and Nemotron) and end-to-end reproduction steps are in
`manyforge/docs/LANE-COMPARISON-direct-vs-openclaw.md` §8.

### Where to read ManyForge's expectations

ManyForge's repos live under `${HOME}/workspaces/dev_ws/src/`.
For assistant-integration questions, look at three places, in this
order:

- **`manyforge/manyforge_composer/backend/`** — the
  `NemoClawAssistantProvider` Python class is the executable spec
  for the contract: what ManyForge sends, what it expects back, what
  it rejects. When the doc disagrees with the code, **the code wins**.
- **`manyforge/docs/reference/`** — human-readable description of the
  contract and the surrounding architecture.
- **`manyforge_specs/`** (sibling repo) — the architectural
  trajectory: skill catalog, intervention sessions, deployment-artifact
  schema, design ADRs. This is where Phase 3+ features (multi-step
  recovery, GUI tree builder) get specced *before* code lands.

These doc paths shift release-to-release; treat the directories as
durable but not the file names.

### Architecture decisions (locked)

- **Pattern B** — bridge service (in the ManyForge repo, not here) translates ManyForge's
  contract into model dispatches with a deployment-scoped tool catalog.
  The bridge is the enforcement point for the bounded-autonomy
  invariant. Pattern C (MCP) is a future evolution gated on upstream
  MCP support in NemoClaw / OpenClaw; not in scope today.
- **Hybrid autonomy** — the LLM operates with multi-step latitude but
  *only over a finite set of pre-approved skills, primitive nodes, and tools*.
  The bridge guarantees the model never sees instruments outside the
  active mode catalog, so any action it proposes is a certifiable
  outcome by construction.
- **Mode-driven instrument catalogs** — the user activates a named
  mode in ManyForge's GUI (e.g. composer-assistant, error-recovery,
  query) which selects which instruments are exposed for that request.
  Modes have per-mode review policies.
- **Skill-declared tools** — each ManyForge skill ships with its own
  `requires_tools` declaration. ManyForge composes the catalog at
  request time from the active skill set + active mode.
- **No tight-latency LLM path** — assistants are for offline
  program-building and recovery decision-making. Real-time control
  (and any future VLA/policy work) is backend territory and out of
  scope for this assistant pipeline.

Detail and rationale live in `manyforge_specs/docs/spec/485-assistant-bridge-architecture.md`.
Mode taxonomy and bounded-autonomy spec live in `manyforge_specs/docs/spec/480-...md`.

## Boundary rules for LLM agents working in this repo

1. **Read before edit.** Before modifying any file under `setup/`,
   `serving/` (especially `serving/docker/`, `serving/config.sh`,
   `serving/launch.sh`), or the `start-*.sh` entrypoints, read the
   relevant scope's workflow doc and any open `*-INVESTIGATION.md`
   notes that touch the same area. The repo's value is mostly in the
   comments — they record traps that took hours to find.

   **Read-before-claim rule for cross-workspace work.** Before
   implementing or claiming scope for anything that crosses a
   workspace boundary (assistant-provider envelope, bridge behaviour,
   deployment-artifact field, skill manifest field, model-serving
   profile referenced from manyforge_specs), read the relevant source
   code in the OTHER workspace, not just its docs. Wire shapes,
   validation rules, and runtime semantics are in code; documentation
   summarises them but can lag. See
   `manyforge_specs/docs/cross-workspace-conventions.md` for the full
   protocol and the authority-by-concern table.

2. **Don't re-implement upstream.** If something feels missing in
   NemoClaw / OpenShell / OpenClaw, the answer is *"check upstream
   first"*. File the issue, work around with a documented manual
   step, wait for the next monthly release. Don't add a script that
   forks or patches their behaviour.

3. **Onboarding can be manual.** The user explicitly accepts manual
   intervention during `nemoclaw onboard`. Do not write scripts that
   try to bypass the wizard, simulate prompts, or pre-populate
   credentials in non-standard locations.

4. **Don't bake secrets, models, or HF tokens into images or scripts.**
   Tokens live in `~/.cache/huggingface/token` and are exported by
   `serving/start-model.sh` / `serving/start-duo.sh` from there. Models live in HF
   cache. The build pipeline pulls neither.

5. **Profile changes go in pairs.** A new profile is two edits:
   `serving/config.sh` (the runtime config) and `serving/launch.sh` (the vLLM
   args). Both must use the same case-statement label. The served name
   is the label.

6. **Be honest about what a benchmark measures.** This repo has been
   burned multiple times by metrics that don't capture the workload
   in question. When proposing a benchmark, name what it measures *and*
   what it doesn't.

7. **Confirm destructive actions.** `nemoclaw onboard` rebuilds the
   sandbox pod and loses workspace state. Container `docker stop`
   before `drop_caches` is fine; `docker system prune` is a separate
   conversation. Stops, restarts, and config wipes against a live
   sandbox are user-confirmed-only.

8. **Match the response style the user prefers.** Terse, no trailing
   summaries, no emoji unless asked. When in doubt, match the diff
   style of nearby commits.

## Pointers to operational docs

Keep these high-level — file names shift, scope endures.

- **`setup/NEMOCLAW-OPENCLAW-WORKFLOW.md`** — canonical end-to-end recipe
  (start model, wire OpenShell, dispatch agent). Read first when
  answering anything operational.
- **`MANYFORGE-ASSISTANT-DEPLOYMENT-PLAN.md`** — profile-selection
  plan for the ManyForge assistant on Thor and Orin (which model fits
  which deployment budget).
- **`MANYFORGE-PROFILE-CALIBRATION.md`** — sizing methodology for
  `max_model_len` / `max_num_seqs` / `gpu_memory_utilization` on
  ManyForge-pipeline-targeted profiles. Read before adding a new
  profile or changing those knobs on an existing one.
- **`MANYFORGE-MCP-INTEGRATION.md`** — end-to-end runbook for routing
  the ManyForge composer-assistant through the OpenClaw agent runtime
  in the `my-assistant` sandbox via Model Context Protocol. Covers the
  skill (`manyforge-composer`), the custom egress preset, the MCP
  stdio bridge, the `setup-manyforge-assistant.sh` provisioner, and
  the Phase 2 OpenClaw assistant bridge. Read first when answering
  "how does the agent talk to ManyForge?"
- **`serving/agentic-bench/README.md`** — bench harness and candidate plan.
- **`serving/docker/`** — Thor-specific build notes and patch rationale,
  including any active TRT-Edge-LLM evaluation.
- **Performance reports** under `serving/docs/` —
  `PERFORMANCE-V*.md`, `TOOL-EVAL-BENCH-THOR.md`, and other dated bench
  docs capture point-in-time numbers; treat them as historical
  evidence, not live state.
- **Architectural investigations** under `serving/docs/` —
  `*-INVESTIGATION.md` files document durable lessons from substantial
  deep-dives (e.g. speculative-decoding behaviour on SM110). These stay
  even after the immediate work is done.

**Transient incident docs** (file names matching `*-HANG-*.md` or
`*-INVESTIGATION-*.md` tied to a single specific incident) are problem
reports, not durable knowledge. They are deleted in the same commit
that closes the issue — the commit message + workflow doc updates carry
the resolution. Don't archive them as "Resolved" entries; don't list
them in permanent-pointer tables.

---

## Maintaining this file

When the verified-version pins shift, the scope shifts, or a new
operational doc is added, update this file. It is the entry point for
new contributors (human or LLM); stale information here costs more
than stale information elsewhere.

This file should contain only **durable** operational guidance.
"Known issues today" tables, dated experiment results, and references
to transient incident docs do **not** belong here — they age fast and
turn the entry point into a graveyard. Use commit messages, dated
bench docs, or upstream issue trackers for that.
