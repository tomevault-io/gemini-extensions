# Decky-Metadata — Agent Operating Contract
## Self-Enforcing Agent Protocol

Protocol Version: 2

This document is the project-local operating contract for agents working in this
directory or its subdirectories. It adapts the universal scripting standards from
`project_template` to this repository's actual stack, and it wires in the
`agent-orchestration` plan → implement → review → finalize engine.

Decky-Metadata is a **Decky Loader plugin** for SteamOS / Steam Deck (Steam Gaming Mode):

- **Frontend:** TypeScript / React in `src/*.ts(x)`, bundled by **rollup** into
  `dist/index.js` (the committed plugin artifact). Tooling is **npm / pnpm**.
- **Backend:** the Decky entry point `main.py` plus the `backend/` package,
  using only the Python standard library and the Decky runtime.

There is **no uv project layout** here, but Python backend tests run through
`uv run --with pytest` in an ephemeral environment (`.protocol: TDD_REQUIRED=true`).
The quality gate covers type checking, build, frontend tests, and backend checks.
It is defined in `scripts/orchestration-hooks/quality-gates`.

# 1. Session Initialization

Before implementation work, verify state with `pwd`, `ls`, `git status`, and config
inspection, then output this handshake:

```
AGENT_PROTOCOL_HANDSHAKE

Project Root:
Detected Language(s): TypeScript/React, Python
Execution Mode: Project
Git Repository Present: (Yes/No)
Cache Root: /tmp/Decky-Metadata
Protocol Version: 2
Command Wrapper: ./run.sh

Confirmed Policies:
[ ] Top-down planning
[ ] Cache isolation (/tmp, never inside Dropbox)
[ ] Verified filesystem state
[ ] Verified dependency state (package.json / node_modules)
[ ] Verified run wrapper

STATUS: READY
```

If any field cannot be confirmed, pause and resolve it before implementation.

Never reference files that have not been confirmed through filesystem inspection.

# 3. Command and Cache Policy

All temp files, tool caches, and installs must live under:

```
/tmp/Decky-Metadata/
```

Run project commands through the wrapper so the redirections apply:

```
./run.sh npm ci
./run.sh npm run build
./run.sh npx tsc --noEmit
./run.sh python3 -m py_compile main.py
```

`run.sh` exports `TMPDIR`, `XDG_CACHE_HOME`, `npm_config_cache`, and
`PYTHONPYCACHEPREFIX` under the cache root. **No generated caches, `node_modules`,
or build temp may be committed inside the repo.** (`dist/index.js` is the one
intentionally committed build output.)

---

# 4. Dependency Policy

- Frontend deps come from `package.json` / `package-lock.json`. Install with
  `npm ci` (or `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`). Never assume a package exists —
  verify it in `package.json` or `node_modules`.
- The backend (`main.py`) targets the Python standard library and the Decky
  runtime. Do not add third-party Python dependencies without an explicit plan
  entry — Decky plugins ship without a package manager on-device.
- If API behavior is uncertain: read the project source, then `@decky/*` or
  official docs, then web search. Speculative code is forbidden.

---

# 5. Execution Protocol

### Mandatory workflow routing

| Trigger | Required start | Mutation boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Implement/change/refactor | `scripts/decky doctor`, then `scripts/decky verify-change [BASE] --explain` | `--device` deploys; `--allow-launch` permits a configured launch fixture |
| Diagnose Deck/log behavior | `scripts/decky doctor --deck`, `scripts/deck/logs.sh audit --json`, `scripts/decky capture` | read-only unless the user requests changes |
| Inspect SteamUI | `scripts/decky steamui snapshot` / `search PATTERN` | snapshots only below `/tmp/Decky-Metadata` |
| Package/send/check | `scripts/decky status --deck`, then `scripts/decky package-push` | require explicit `--build` / `--push` outside an authorized hook |

Use [docs/runbooks/agent-workflow.md](docs/runbooks/agent-workflow.md) for the
detailed flow. Hook and skill installers default to checks/dry-runs and require
`--install`. Device deployment, launch, package copying, and the `dev` to `main`
promotion retain their explicit flags and human gates.

Lifecycle for a modifying task:

```
ANALYZE → PLAN → IMPLEMENT → VALIDATE → COMMIT → DOCUMENT
```

- **PLAN:** keep non-trivial native plans in task state. For an orchestration run,
  edit the private path returned by `scripts/orchestration/new-plan <slug> <title>`
  and validate it with `scripts/orchestration/validate-plan <slug>`.
- **VALIDATE:** run the quality gate (Section 6) and confirm it passes.
- **COMMIT:** Conventional Commits, on a feature branch (Section 7).
- **DOCUMENT:** update maintained product documentation when behavior or usage
  changes; report progress and verification in chat, not a session-log file.

For review-only tasks that do not modify files, stop after ANALYZE and report
findings.

# 6. Quality Gate (Definition of Done)

Before any commit, the change must pass the project quality gate:

```
./scripts/orchestration-hooks/quality-gates
```

which runs:

```
npx tsc --noEmit          # frontend type-check
npm run build             # rollup bundle -> dist/index.js
python3 -m py_compile main.py   # backend syntax check
uv run --with pytest -- pytest -q   # backend tests
```

A modifying task is complete only when:

```
[ ] tsc --noEmit passes
[ ] npm run build succeeds (dist/index.js regenerated when frontend changed)
[ ] vitest passes (frontend unit tests: src/**/*.test.ts)
[ ] main.py byte-compiles
[ ] pytest passes when tests/ exists
[ ] README updated when behavior or usage changed
[ ] caches/installs stayed under /tmp/Decky-Metadata
[ ] progress and verification reported in chat
[ ] on-device checks run for src/steam/ changes (see below)
```

**On-device verification.** Changes under `src/steam/` must additionally pass
the live checks on the Deck — two shipped regressions were invisible to the
static gates. Use the committed tooling in `scripts/deck/` (tunnel, CDP
client, deploy loop, smoke suite) instead of recreating it ad hoc:

```
scripts/deck/deploy.sh            # build -> push -> hard reload -> wait
scripts/deck/verify/run_all.sh    # launch / quick-links / re-render smokes
```

Which checks each change requires, plus debugging recipes and hazards
(notably: NEVER enumerate MobX store instances — overview/details/appStore —
inside a render-phase tree walk; it wedges the renderer), are documented in
`docs/runbooks/on-device-verification.md`. For QAM/panel/editor focus and D-pad
order, drive `scripts/deck/cdp.py input` (synthetic controller keys) plus the
`js/gpfocus_dump.js` / `js/focus_order.js` probes — do not hand-roll a
key-dispatch script (see that runbook's "Controller navigation & initial focus").

The `scripts/check_tdd.sh` pre-commit hook runs the lighter staged-file subset of
these checks.

`scripts/post_commit.sh` is an optional build-package-push hook that builds +
packages the plugin (`npm run package`, which stamps the short git hash into the
plugin version) and `scp`s the fixed-name `Decky-Metadata.zip` to the Steam Deck
for the Developer-Mode sideload loop. It runs only on `dev`/`main` by default (set
`DECKY_POST_COMMIT_ALL=1` to force any branch), skips the push when the Deck is
unreachable, and never blocks a commit. Config: `DECKY_DECK_HOST` (default `steamdeck`),
`DECKY_DECK_DEST` (default `/home/deck/Downloads/`).

Install the script as **both** hooks, each execing it (same pattern as
`pre-commit`):

- `.git/hooks/post-commit` — fires on direct `git commit` (e.g. feature-branch work).
- `.git/hooks/post-merge` — fires on `git merge` / `git pull`. This one is
  required for the orchestration flow: `dev` is advanced only by `git merge --no-ff`,
  and **git merge fires `post-merge`, not `post-commit`**, so without it the auto
  build/package/push never runs when work lands on `dev`.

---

# 7. Git Policy

Work on feature branches, never directly on `main`:

```
feat/<feature>   fix/<bug>   refactor/<component>   docs/<topic>
```

Commits use Conventional Commits:

```
feat(achievements): add Xbox source fallback
fix(steam): handle missing app id in news fetch
refactor(backend): extract metadata matcher
docs(readme): document RetroAchievements setup
```

Prefer small, atomic commits (one coherent change each). Commit the passing
current change before starting an unrelated one. Generated artifacts (caches,
`node_modules`, zips) must never be committed.

Before the human-approved `dev` → `main` promotion, prepare the stable changelog
rollover on `dev` as described below. After promotion, run `scripts/release.sh`;
it creates the version commit when the metadata version changes (otherwise it
tags the current `HEAD`), an annotated tag, and a hash-free package, but only
prints the outward-facing push commands. Pushing the tag lets GitHub Actions
publish `Decky-Metadata.zip` **plus** the self-updater sidecars
`Decky-Metadata-<tag>.zip.sha256` and
`Decky-Metadata-<tag>.manifest.json` (the manifest carries the whole-zip sha256
the updater and Decky Loader verify). Then move the dev base to the next patch so
the drift guard stays green:

```
# Replace X.Y.Z with the human-approved version matching the curated changelog.
scripts/release.sh X.Y.Z
git push origin main
git push origin vX.Y.Z
scripts/bump_next_patch.sh
```

**Release notes / CHANGELOG.** Stable releases require a curated, dated
`## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` section in `CHANGELOG.md` whose body begins with a
non-bullet summary line. Both `scripts/release.sh` and stable-release CI enforce
this via `scripts/changelog.py`; CI enriches the release title to
`vX.Y.Z — <summary>` from that leading line.

Prepare each release rollover on `dev`, before the `dev` → `main` promotion.
Rename the existing `## [Unreleased]` header to
`## [X.Y.Z] - <today>`—do not add a second `[X.Y.Z]` header—ensure its content
begins with a non-bullet summary, add a fresh empty `## [Unreleased]` above it,
and commit. Then merge `dev` → `main` with `--no-ff` and run
`scripts/release.sh X.Y.Z` on clean `main`. Preparing the rename on `dev` keeps
both branches aligned: after the release, `scripts/bump_next_patch.sh` on `dev`
sits above the fresh `[Unreleased]`, preventing stale dev notes and a later
dated-section merge conflict.

The `decky-release-notes` skill's Mode B automates this full local cut, including
the `dev` → `main` merge and `scripts/release.sh`. It stops before pushing by
default and publishes only when the maintainer explicitly requests it for that
invocation.

Manual dev prereleases publish the current `## [Unreleased]` notes. Immediately
after a stable cut that new section is empty, so `dev-release.yml` intentionally
refuses to publish until a new entry is added; this is not a bug.

**Plugin identity — distribution vs Decky display.** Two names, deliberately
different. Do not "unify" them.

- **Decky display: `Decky Metadata`** (with a space) — lives in `plugin.json`
  `name`, in the QAM header via `titleView`, and in `EXPECTED_PLUGIN_NAME` in
  `src/updater/deckyInstaller.ts`. Decky Loader keys an installed plugin off the
  manifest `name`, and the self-updater passes that exact string to
  `install_plugin` to replace in place. **Changing it breaks in-place updates for
  everyone already installed.**
- **Distribution: `Decky-Metadata`** (hyphenated) — the repository name,
  `PLUGIN_FOLDER_NAME` in `scripts/package.mjs`, the ZIP root and filename, and
  the installed directory `/home/deck/homebrew/plugins/Decky-Metadata` that
  `scripts/deck/deploy.sh`, `install_release.sh`, and `decky_doctor.py` all
  target. Its npm spelling is `decky-metadata`.

Decky derives the settings, runtime, and log directories from the archive/install
folder rather than from `plugin.json` `name`, which is why the two can differ
safely.

This split was made deliberately in `d0b8c49 refactor(identity): plugin identity
'Decky-Metadata' -> 'Decky Metadata'` (branch `identity-space`, merged as
`c4fb484`). An earlier version of this paragraph predated that commit and said
the canonical identity was `Decky-Metadata` and to "not reintroduce a space into
the `name` field" — following that instruction today would strip the space from
`plugin.json` and break in-place updates. Corrected 2026-07-28.

`Decky-SteamAchievements` uses the identical pattern (`Achievements Restored`
display, `Decky-SteamAchievements` distribution), and the upstream reference is
the installed `Storage Cleaner` plugin, whose folder is `decky-storage-cleaner`
while its manifest/list name is `Storage Cleaner`.

**Release channels.** Two GitHub prerelease flows exist and must not be
conflated:
- The rolling `dev-build` prerelease (auto-refreshed on every `dev` push, fixed
  `dev-build` tag) is for the on-device sideload loop only. Its non-semver tag means the
  self-updater's discovery deliberately skips it — it is **not** an update
  source.
- The **Dev Release** workflow (`.github/workflows/dev-release.yml`, manual
  `workflow_dispatch`) publishes distinct `vX.Y.Z-dev.g<sha>` semver
  prereleases with a manifest + checksum. These are what the updater's
  "development" channel discovers and installs.

Version grammar the updater parses (and `scripts/package.mjs --release-version`
accepts): `X.Y.Z`, optionally `-dev.<id>` (development channel) and/or
`+<build>` metadata. A local `npm run package` still stamps `X.Y.Z+<hash>`.
The in-plugin updater does not replace it with a development prerelease, but
offers an explicit **Move to Stable** handoff when canonical `X.Y.Z` is published.

README screenshots are committed
under `assets/` and use stable relative paths with a
`?cacheBuster=YYYYMMDD` query. Bump that value whenever committed screenshots
are re-captured so GitHub's image proxy serves the updated images.

# 8. Agent Orchestration (plan → implement → review → finalize)

This repo uses `scripts/orchestration` and the effective settings from
`orchestration.conf` plus `orchestration.conf.local`. Active plans and recovery data
stay in private Git metadata by default. Project caches still use `/tmp/Decky-Metadata`.

Two skills drive it:

- **`orchestration-plan-author`** creates and validates a private local plan, then
  stops. It does not commit a plan or start implementation.
- **`/orchestrated-implementation`** explicitly launches an authorized implementer,
  submits review findings through stdin with the captured run, round, plan version,
  and completed revision, and integrates the feature only after approval.

The companion **`decky-release-notes`** project skill drafts `CHANGELOG.md` notes
and can perform the full local stable cut required by §7. Its Mode B stops before
the public push by default and publishes only with explicit per-invocation
authorization.

Run `scripts/orchestration/run-quality-gates` before marking a round complete.
`finalize` checks the approved target and invokes the release hook unless local-only
mode disables it. Base-to-`main` promotion remains a human gate. See the shared
engine's `USAGE.md` for the conversational workflow.

---

# 9. Documentation & Progress Reporting

Report concise progress, decisions, and verification in chat. Do not create or
commit process plans, review files, conversation exports, session logs, or
verification reports. Keep active plans, findings, and recovery data local.
Preserve maintained product documentation, fixtures, and unique research.

---

# 10. Failure Recovery

On failure: capture the error output, identify the failing component, fix the
root cause, and re-run the quality gate. Blind retries are forbidden.
