# CoinSpot Agentic Trading

You have access to the CoinSpot brokerage API via the `coinspot-agentic-trading` Node.js library.
The API provides **instant brokerage** (buy now / sell now / swap) — there is no order book or limit orders. All amounts are in AUD unless otherwise specified.

## How to run commands

Execute inline Node.js scripts using the library. The library is installed in the OpenClaw skills directory. Always use `try/catch` to handle errors gracefully.

```bash
node -e "
const trading = require('$CONSTANTS_SKILLS_DIR/coinspot-agentic-trading/scripts');
(async () => {
  try {
    const result = await trading.functionName(args);
    console.log(JSON.stringify(result, null, 2));
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('Error:', err.message);
  }
})();
"
```

## Available functions

### Agentic Status & Limits (no approval needed)
- `checkAgenticStatus()` — check whether this API key has agentic trading enabled
- `getAgenticLimits()` — retrieve the user-configured limits for this agentic API key (per-trade max, daily limits, etc.). **Always check this when an order fails** — the most common cause of rejected trades is exceeding agentic key limits.

### Prices & Discovery (no approval needed)
- `getBuyNowCoinList()` — list all coins available for instant buy/swap. Use this to discover valid coin names before quoting.
- `getSellNowCoinList()` — list all coins available for instant sell/swap. Use this to discover valid coin names before quoting.

### Price checks

There is no dedicated price endpoint. To check current prices, use `getBuyQuote()` or `getSellQuote()` with a small AUD amount (e.g. `getBuyQuote('BTC', 1, 'aud')`). The returned rate is the current live price. When a user asks "what's the price of X?", use a quote call to retrieve it.

### Balances (no approval needed)
- `getAllBalances()` — full portfolio balances
- `getCoinBalance(cointype)` — single coin balance (e.g. `'ETH'`)

### Quotes (no approval needed)
- `getBuyQuote(cointype, amount, amounttype)` — quote to buy. `amounttype` is `'aud'` or the coin ticker (e.g. `'btc'`)
- `getSellQuote(cointype, amount, amounttype)` — quote to sell
- `getSwapQuote(cointypesell, cointypebuy, amount)` — quote to swap `amount` of `cointypesell` into `cointypebuy`

### Trading (APPROVAL REQUIRED — see rules below)
- `executeBuy(cointype, amount, amounttype)` — execute a buy
- `executeSell(cointype, amount, amounttype)` — execute a sell
- `executeSwap(cointypesell, cointypebuy, amount)` — execute a swap

### Order & Transaction History (no approval needed)
- `getOrderHistory(opts)` — completed orders. `opts`: `{ cointype, startdate, enddate, limit }`
- `getMarketOrderHistory(opts)` — completed market orders
- `getOpenLimitOrders(cointype)` — open limit orders (optional cointype filter)
- `getSendReceiveHistory(opts)` — send/receive transactions
- `getDepositHistory(opts)` — AUD deposit history
- `getWithdrawalHistory(opts)` — AUD withdrawal history

### Wallet (no approval needed)
- `getDepositAddress(cointype)` — get deposit address for a coin
- `getWithdrawalDetails(cointype)` — get withdrawal details for a coin

## Critical rules for trading

### 1. ALWAYS get a quote and seek approval before executing any trade

Before calling `executeBuy`, `executeSell`, or `executeSwap`, you MUST:

1. **Get a quote first** using the corresponding quote function
2. **Present the quote clearly** to the user, including the coin, amount, rate, and total cost/proceeds
3. **Explicitly ask for confirmation** — e.g. "Would you like me to proceed with this trade?"
4. **Only execute after the user confirms** with a clear affirmative response

Never execute a trade without explicit user approval. This is non-negotiable.

### 2. Handle multi-step commands sequentially

When the user gives a compound instruction like "sell all my ETH then buy BTC with the AUD", break it into steps:

1. Check current ETH balance
2. Get a sell quote for the full ETH balance
3. Present the sell quote and ask for approval
4. If approved, execute the sell
5. Check updated AUD balance
6. Get a buy quote for BTC with the available AUD
7. Present the buy quote and ask for approval
8. If approved, execute the buy

Always confirm each trade individually. Never batch-execute multiple trades without separate approvals.

### 3. Understand amount types

Users may specify amounts in different ways:
- **AUD amount**: "Buy $200 worth of BTC" → `executeBuy('BTC', 200, 'aud')`
- **Coin amount**: "Buy 0.005 BTC" → `executeBuy('BTC', 0.005, 'btc')`
- **"All" or "everything"**: Check the balance first, then use the full amount
- **Swap amounts are always in the sell coin**: "Swap 0.1 ETH for BTC" → `executeSwap('ETH', 'BTC', 0.1)`

### 4. Error handling

Agentic API keys have user-configurable trade limits. If a trade fails:
- Call `getAgenticLimits()` to check whether the trade exceeded the key's limits
- Report the error message and relevant limits clearly to the user
- Suggest alternatives (e.g. smaller amount, adjust limits, try again later)
- Do not retry automatically
- Do not assume or speculate about CoinSpot fees, spreads, or platform behaviour — if the user has questions, direct them to the official CoinSpot knowledgebase at https://coinspot.zendesk.com

### 5. Coin identifiers

Always use uppercase coin tickers (e.g. `'BTC'`, `'ETH'`, `'ADA'`). If the user says a coin name, map it to the correct ticker. Use `getBuyNowCoinList()` or `getSellNowCoinList()` to discover available assets and resolve coin names before requesting a quote.

### 6. Recommended trading workflow

When preparing a trade:
1. Call `getBuyNowCoinList()` or `getSellNowCoinList()` to confirm the coin is available and get the correct coin name
2. Call the appropriate quote function (`getBuyQuote`, `getSellQuote`, or `getSwapQuote`) to get current pricing
3. Present the quote and get user approval
4. Execute the trade

### 7. Agentic limits

Agentic API keys have user-configurable limits. If an order is rejected or fails, call `getAgenticLimits()` to check the current limits and report them to the user. Do not guess at what the limits might be — always retrieve them from the API.
Agentic API keys are unable perform withdrawals of cryptocurrencies from a users account.

### 8. Coin Precision

Amounts and rates are are traded with a precision of 8 decimals. Attempting to trade Coin or AUD amounts with greater than 8 decimals may result in an error response.

## Response style

- **Default**: Brief and concise — just the key numbers and facts
- **When asked for detail**: Include 24h change, portfolio percentages, rate comparisons, etc.
- Adapt to the user's preference. If they ask short questions, give short answers. If they want analysis, provide it.

## Price alerts and monitoring

When the user asks you to monitor prices or set alerts, use OpenClaw's scheduling capabilities to periodically check prices via quote functions. For example:
- "Give me a portfolio summary every morning" — schedule periodic balance checks
- "Notify me when SOL is <$200" — schedule coin price checks

Only set up monitoring when explicitly requested by the user. Do not proactively monitor without being asked.

## CoinSpot support

Do not assume or speculate about CoinSpot platform details such as fees, spreads, deposit methods, or account features. If the user has questions about the CoinSpot platform, direct them to the official CoinSpot knowledgebase at https://coinspot.zendesk.com.
