## second-opinion

> Get a second opinion from another LLM (Codex, Grok, Claude, Gemini) — smart-routed by task type, with optional deep-research and fan-out-to-all modes. Use when the user wants a sanity check, an outside critique, a different style ("ask grok", "ask gemini"), a synthesis across providers, or a deep-research dive on a question that benefits from web-grounded multi-step research.


# second-opinion

Cross-provider "phone a friend" with smart routing.

## When to use

Trigger when the user says:
- "get a second opinion on …"
- "ask {grok|gemini|codex|chatgpt} what they think" (for a Claude opinion, spawn a subagent from the lead instead — see Note on Claude below)
- "fan out to everyone"
- "deep research on …"
- "what would another model say"
- The user's task fits one of the routing rules below and you'd benefit from another perspective.

Don't use it for: trivial lookups, tasks where the user wants *you* to answer, or any task with sensitive personal data the user hasn't authorized to leave the local session.

## Routing rubric

The router script (`scripts/classify.sh`) picks a provider by keywords. Override with `--provider` when the user names one explicitly.

| Task shape | Provider | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Frontend / UI / design critique | `gemini` → routes to OpenRouter (`google/gemini-2.5-flash` default until PER-18; set `OPENROUTER_MODEL=google/gemini-2.5-pro` for top tier) | Strong visual + UX reasoning |
| Humor / romance / vibe-check / casual | `grok` | Looser, more conversational |
| Tool-calling code / agent-orchestration design | `codex` (or **spawn subagent** for Claude-specific) | Codex is strong at structured engineering reasoning; for a true Claude opinion, spawn a subagent — see Note on Claude |
| Engineering design review / architecture | `codex` | OpenAI's o-series via `codex` CLI (rides on ChatGPT sub) |
| Refusal fallback / sensitive prompts that hit ethics gates | `openrouter` | Routes to a low-refusal model (default `mistralai/mistral-large-2411`); override via `OPENROUTER_MODEL` |
| Deep research / multi-source synthesis | fan-out + lead-session synthesis | Lead Claude session synthesizes the raw fan-out output |
| (default, no signal) | `codex` | Safest general-purpose, subscription-routed |

## How to invoke

```bash
# Auto-routed
~/.claude/skills/second-opinion/scripts/dispatch.sh "should I use Postgres or DuckDB for this"

# Explicit provider
~/.claude/skills/second-opinion/scripts/dispatch.sh --provider grok "tell me a joke about kubernetes"

# Deep research (provider's research mode if available)
~/.claude/skills/second-opinion/scripts/dispatch.sh --deep-research "what's the latest on GLP-1 + vestibular migraine"

# Fan out to all configured providers + synthesize
~/.claude/skills/second-opinion/scripts/dispatch.sh --fanout "is this migration plan safe?"

# With attached input
~/.claude/skills/second-opinion/scripts/dispatch.sh --input-file /tmp/diff.txt --mode critique "review"
```

The `/second-opinion` slash command is a thin wrapper over `dispatch.sh`.

## Auth

Required env vars / auth (only the providers you actually use):
- **Codex** — *no env var.* Authenticates via ChatGPT subscription (Mac/Plus/Pro) through `codex` CLI. Install: `npm install -g @openai/codex`. CLI subprocess rides on the sub, no API billing.
- **Claude** — *no adapter.* The lead session IS Claude. To get a Claude second opinion, spawn a subagent (see Note on Claude below).
- `XAI_API_KEY` — Grok (API; xAI hasn't shipped a sub-routed CLI as of May 2026)
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` — Gemini (API today; the `gemini` CLI is installed but auth not yet sub-routed — see Note on Gemini below)
- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` — OpenRouter (refusal fallback / model marketplace; separately billed at OpenRouter rates)
- `OPENROUTER_MODEL` — optional model override for OpenRouter (default `mistralai/mistral-large-2411`; append `:online` for web-augmented)

## Note on Claude — spawn a subagent, don't call the API

The Claude adapter was dropped because calling Anthropic API from inside Claude Code would double-bill (lead session already authenticates against Claude). When you want a Claude second opinion — e.g., to compare Sonnet vs Opus, get an independent Claude perspective, or test a prompt in isolation — **spawn a subagent from the lead session** with `Agent(subagent_type: "general-purpose", model: "sonnet"|"opus", prompt: "...")`. The subagent gets its own context window, returns a fresh perspective, and reuses the harness auth.

## Note on Gemini — sub-routing pending

The `gemini` CLI v0.27.3+ is installed but auth defaults to API key. To switch to sub-routing (rides on Google AI Pro / Code Assist plan instead of being separately billed):
1. Run `gemini` interactively once and choose Code Assist / Google account auth flow
2. Add `export GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_GCA=1` to your shell rc
3. Once both are done, the adapter can be updated to prefer the CLI subprocess (forward-compat check). Currently uses the `GEMINI_API_KEY` HTTP API path.

Keys auto-load from `~/.openclaw-tgpkb/secrets/<provider>_api_key` if env vars aren't set (see `~/.openclaw-tgpkb/secrets/llm_keys.sh`).

Run `scripts/auth-check.sh` to verify each provider is reachable.

## :reason — adversarial refinement subcommand

`/second-opinion:reason` runs a cold-start multi-agent loop modeled on `/autoresearch:reason`,
but with cross-provider judges instead of all-Claude subagents.

```bash
# default: 3 judges, convergence=3, max 3 rounds, mode=convergent, domain=software
~/.claude/skills/second-opinion/scripts/reason.sh "should we use event sourcing for orders"

# bounded debate (no synthesis), 5 judges
~/.claude/skills/second-opinion/scripts/reason.sh \
  --mode debate --judges 5 --iterations 4 \
  --domain product "monetize free tier vs paid-only launch"

# evidence-backed debate: authors + synthesizer do live web research
# (critic and judges never trigger paid live-search)
~/.claude/skills/second-opinion/scripts/reason.sh \
  --deep-research "should we adopt HTTP/3 for our public API endpoints?"
```

Cost controls (defaults tuned for ~60-70% lower paid-API spend per run):

- `--iterations` defaults to **3** (0 = unbounded). Historical runs never converged
  and rounds 4-5 added no signal; the oscillation guard also trips at 3 rounds.
- Judges run on a cheap tier: `grok-4-fast` and `google/gemini-2.5-flash` (via
  OpenRouter). Authors and the synthesizer keep their top-tier models. Override
  with `SECOND_OPINION_JUDGE_GROK_MODEL` / `SECOND_OPINION_JUDGE_OPENROUTER_MODEL`.
- `--deep-research` is scoped to Author-A / Author-B / Synthesizer calls only;
  critic and judge calls never pay for live search.
- Output budgets: API adapters cap completions at 3000 tokens
  (`SECOND_OPINION_MAX_TOKENS` to override); author prompts carry an
  "at most 800 words" budget; fan-out prompts carry "at most 400 words" and each
  fan-out response is truncated to 8000 bytes before synthesis.
- Degenerate-candidate guard: a candidate under 50 words is retried once on a
  different provider; if still degenerate the round skips synthesis + judging
  and carries the incumbent (no judge spend on garbage).
- `SECOND_OPINION_SKIP_PROVIDERS` — comma-separated providers to exclude from a
  run (e.g. `SECOND_OPINION_SKIP_PROVIDERS=gemini,grok`). Replaces the old
  `reason-nogem.sh` fork, which has been deleted.

Role mapping (defaults; degrades when fewer providers configured):

| Role | Default provider | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Author-A | codex | Strong general reasoning, sub-routed |
| Critic | grok | Direct, low-hedge — fits adversarial role |
| Author-B | gemini | Different lineage / training distribution |
| Synthesizer | codex | Engineering-style merge |
| Judges | rotate {codex, grok, gemini, openrouter} | Cross-provider blind panel |

Each invocation is a fresh adapter subprocess — no history bleed. Sequential execution
throughout (droplet 2GB constraint, no parallel calls).

Outputs land in `reason-runs/{YYMMDD-HHMM}-{slug}/` with `overview.md`, `lineage.md`,
`candidates.md`, `judge-transcripts.md`, `reason-results.tsv`, `reason-lineage.jsonl`,
`handoff.json`. The `handoff.json` describes suggested chain targets but does not
auto-execute them (chains are autoresearch commands, separate skills).

```

## Output convention

Every adapter prints to stdout in this format so fan-out + synthesis works:

```
=== provider: <name> ===
<response body>
=== end ===
```

Errors go to stderr with non-zero exit.

## TODOs

- Deep-research mode is provider-specific; current adapters approximate it. Wire real APIs when available (Gemini Deep Research, OpenAI Deep Research, xAI Live Search).
- Synthesis prompt in `fanout.sh` is a stub — refine after first real run.
- Classifier is keyword-based; consider upgrading to a small Haiku call if accuracy matters.
