# Pointa Project Context

## Project Overview

**Pointa** is a Chrome extension + local MCP server for AI-powered development annotations. Point at any UI element, leave feedback, and let AI implement changes.

- **Chrome Extension** (Manifest V3) — Runs in browser, captures annotations, bugs, performance issues
- **MCP Server** (`pointa-server` npm package) — Local Node.js server that runs on developer's machine
- **Monorepo** — Both live in this single repo

## Release & Versioning

**Trigger:** Merge PR to `main` with conventional commit messages.

**Semantic-release automatically:**
1. Analyzes commit messages (feat/fix/etc)
2. Determines version bump (major/minor/patch)
3. Runs `scripts/sync-versions.js` to bump all 3 files
4. Builds extension zip
5. Publishes `pointa-server` to NPM
6. Creates GitHub Release with extension zip attached
7. Commits version bumps to git with `[skip ci]`

### Commit Message Format

Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]
```

**Types that trigger releases:**
- `feat:` → MINOR bump (1.2.0 → 1.3.0)
- `fix:` / `perf:` / `refactor:` → PATCH bump (1.2.0 → 1.2.1)
- `feat!:` or `BREAKING CHANGE:` → MAJOR bump (1.2.0 → 2.0.0)

**Types that DON'T release:**
- `docs:` / `chore:` / `ci:` / `test:` / `style:` — no version bump

**Examples:**
```
feat: add fallback handling for removed elements
fix: correct sidebar CSS isolation with Shadow DOM
docs: update README with backend log setup
chore(release): 1.2.0 [skip ci]
```

## Version Sync

All three locations are kept in sync by `scripts/sync-versions.js`:
- `package.json` (root)
- `annotations-server/package.json`
- `extension/manifest.json`

This runs automatically during release. If you ever need to manually sync versions:
```bash
node scripts/sync-versions.js <version>
```

## Key Files

- **`.releaserc.json`** — Semantic-release pipeline config
- **`.github/workflows/release.yml`** — CI/CD workflow (runs on push to main)
- **`scripts/sync-versions.js`** — Version synchronization script
- **`CHANGELOG.md`** — Release notes (auto-generated)
- **`extension/manifest.json`** — Extension metadata + version
- **`annotations-server/package.json`** — NPM package config + version

## NPM Publishing

The `pointa-server` package is published to npm at:
- https://www.npmjs.com/package/pointa-server
- Users install: `npm install -g pointa-server` or `npx pointa-server`

**Not auto-published to Chrome Web Store** — that's manual (download zip from GitHub Release, upload to Web Store).

## Development

```bash
# Install server deps
cd annotations-server
npm install

# Run server locally (watches for changes)
npm run dev

# Lint
npm run lint
npm run lint:fix
```

## Demo & QA Fixtures

Pre-built annotations and bug reports for demos and testing. See `testing/DEMO.md` for full docs.

```bash
./scripts/load-demo.sh                    # Load fixtures into ~/.pointa/
cd annotations-server && npm run dev      # Start MCP server
python3 -m http.server 8080               # Serve demo page (from repo root)
# Open http://localhost:8080/testing/demo-app/index.html with Pointa extension
./scripts/clear-demo.sh                   # Restore original data
```

**Fixtures live in** `testing/fixtures/demo/` (annotations + bug reports targeting the demo landing page).

## Important Rules

### Lock files must be committed
`annotations-server/.gitignore` uses a blanket `*.json` rule (to exclude runtime data files) with explicit exceptions. **`package-lock.json` must stay in the exceptions list** (`!package-lock.json`). The CI release workflow uses `npm ci`, which hard-fails without a lock file. If you add dependencies, always commit the updated `package-lock.json`.

### Don't edit auto-generated files
- **`CHANGELOG.md`** — auto-generated by semantic-release. Never edit manually.
- **Version numbers** in `package.json`, `annotations-server/package.json`, and `extension/manifest.json` — bumped automatically by `scripts/sync-versions.js` during release. Only edit manually via the sync script if needed.

### annotations-server/.gitignore has a blanket *.json rule
The `*.json` rule in `annotations-server/.gitignore` excludes all JSON files except those explicitly allowlisted (`!package.json`, `!package-lock.json`). If you add a new JSON config file to that directory, you must add a corresponding `!filename.json` exception or it will be silently ignored by git.

### Extension has no build step
The Chrome extension (`extension/`) is plain JS with no bundler. Files are used as-is. Don't introduce build tooling without discussion.

### NPM publish requires NPM_TOKEN secret
The release workflow uses `secrets.NPM_TOKEN` to publish `pointa-server` to npm. If publishing fails, check that the secret is configured in the repo's GitHub settings.

### Port 4242 is hardcoded in the extension
The server runs on port 4242 by default. The extension has `http://127.0.0.1:4242` hardcoded in `extension/background/background.js`. If you change the server port, the extension won't connect. Server port can be overridden via `POINTA_PORT` env var, but you'd need to update the extension too.

### User data lives in ~/.pointa/, never in the repo
All runtime data (`annotations.json`, `archive.json`, `issue_reports.json`, `config.json`, `images/`) is stored in `~/.pointa/`. This directory is user-local and never committed. The `data/` and `*.json` gitignore rules in `annotations-server/` exist to prevent accidental commits of data files.

### Serialized file writes (saveLock pattern)
The server serializes all file writes using Promise chains (`this.saveLock = this.saveLock.then(...)`) to prevent race conditions from concurrent requests. Never bypass this pattern or parallelize file writes to the same data file.

### Extension uses vanilla JS — no imports/exports
Extension code in `extension/content/` and `extension/background/` uses plain JavaScript classes and globals. No ES modules, no bundler, no transpilation. Content script modules in `extension/content/modules/` are loaded via script tags, not imports.

### Localhost-only features
Most extension features (annotations, bug reports) only activate on localhost URLs: `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `0.0.0.0`, `*.local`, `*.test`, `*.localhost`. Non-localhost pages only get the sidebar for onboarding/settings.

### Server has multiple run modes
- **HTTP daemon** (`pointa-server start`) — background process for Chrome extension API + WebSocket + MCP over HTTP
- **Stdio mode** (`POINTA_STDIO_MODE=true`) — MCP protocol via stdin/stdout for Claude Code
- **Dev mode** (`pointa-server dev <command>`) — wraps user's dev server, injects Node.js preload script via `NODE_OPTIONS` to capture backend logs

### Node.js >= 18 required
`engines` field in `annotations-server/package.json` requires Node 18+. CI runs on Node 20.

### Formatting conventions
2-space indentation for JS, JSON, CSS, HTML, YAML. LF line endings. UTF-8. Trim trailing whitespace (except Markdown). See `.editorconfig`.

## Git Workflow

- **Commit after every completed unit of work.** Never let changes accumulate.
- After implementing a feature, fixing a bug, or completing any discrete task, immediately stage and commit with a clear, conventional commit message.
- Commit granularity: prefer small, atomic commits (one logical change per commit).
- Format: `type(scope): description` (e.g., `feat(auth): add login endpoint`, `fix(ui): correct button alignment`)
- Never wait for the user to ask you to commit. Committing is part of completing the task.
- Do NOT bundle unrelated changes into a single commit.

## Workflow

1. Create feature branch from `main`
2. Make changes, commit with conventional messages
3. Push to origin, open PR
4. Get review, merge to `main`
5. Semantic-release automatically triggers, creates version + release
