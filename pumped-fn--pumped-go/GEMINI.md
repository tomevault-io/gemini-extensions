# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Overview

Pumped Go is a graph-based dependency injection and reactive execution library for Go. It organizes code around three core concepts:

1. **Executors**: Units of computation with explicit dependencies (long-lived resources)
2. **Scopes**: Lifecycle managers that resolve and cache executor values
3. **Flows**: Short-span executable operations with hierarchical execution contexts

## Important Documentation

Before working on this codebase, read these key documents:

- **DESIGN.md** - Core design decisions, TypeScript vs Go differences, why controllers for everything, performance considerations
- **INTEGRATION_PATTERNS.md** - Detailed comparison of CLI vs HTTP server integration patterns, when caching matters, hybrid patterns for workers

## Code Quality Requirements

**CRITICAL: When making any code changes, you MUST ensure the following pass before committing:**

1. **Linting**: `devbox run lint` or `golangci-lint run --timeout=5m`
2. **Build**: `devbox run build` or `go build -v ./...`
3. **Tests**: `devbox run test` or `CGO_ENABLED=1 go test -v -race ./...`

**Workflow for code changes:**
```bash
# 1. Make your changes
# 2. Run all three checks
devbox run lint
devbox run build
devbox run test

# OR run full CI pipeline
devbox run ci

# 3. Only commit if ALL checks pass
```

**Do NOT commit code that:**
- Fails linting checks
- Fails to build
- Breaks existing tests
- Introduces race conditions (detected by `-race` flag)

## Development Commands

This project uses [Devbox](https://www.jetify.com/devbox/) for reproducible development environments.

CGO_ENABLED=1 go test -v -race ./path/to/package

# Run single test in package
CGO_ENABLED=1 go test -v -race -run TestSpecificName ./executor_test.go
```

## Architecture

### Core Design Principles

1. **Executors are their own keys**: No string IDs required - executor pointers serve as unique identifiers
2. **Controllers for everything**: All dependencies passed as `*Controller[T]` for maximum flexibility (get, update, reload, release)
3. **Standalone functions for type parameters**: Since Go doesn't support type params on methods, use `Resolve[T](scope, exec)` instead of `scope.Resolve[T](exec)`
4. **Reactive graph tracking**: Dependencies tracked via `ReactiveGraph` (graph.go) for efficient invalidation propagation

### Key Files

- **executor.go**: Defines `Executor[T]`, `Dependency`, `DependencyMode` (Static/Reactive/Lazy)
- **scope.go**: Scope lifecycle, resolution, caching, reactive graph management
- **flow.go**: Flow execution, `ExecutionCtx`, execution tree tracking
- **graph.go**: `ReactiveGraph` for tracking upstream/downstream dependencies
- **controller.go**: `Controller[T]` providing Get/Update/Reload/Release operations
- **extension.go**: Extension interface for cross-cutting concerns
- **tag.go**: Type-safe metadata system
- **executor_generated.go, flow_generated.go**: Generated code for Derive1-5, Flow0-5 (see codegen/)

### Dependency Modes

- **Static** (default): Resolve once, cache forever
- **Reactive**: Invalidate and re-resolve when dependency changes
- **Lazy**: Defer resolution until explicitly requested

See DESIGN.md for detailed explanations and performance considerations.

### Reactive Graph Traversal

The reactive graph (graph.go) uses **iterative traversal** (not recursive) to find all dependents when an executor is updated. This prevents stack overflow on deep dependency chains.

```go
// In scope.go:
func (s *Scope) findReactiveDependents(exec AnyExecutor) []AnyExecutor {
    return s.graph.FindDependents(exec) // Iterative traversal in graph.go
}
```

### Controllers

All dependencies are passed as controllers. Key methods: `Get()`, `Peek()`, `Update()`, `Release()`, `Reload()`, `IsCached()`. See DESIGN.md for why controllers are used for everything.

### Flows vs Executors

- **Executors**: Long-lived resources (DB connections, services, configs) - resolved once per scope lifetime
- **Flows**: Short-span operations (HTTP requests, queries, commands) - executed per request with context isolation

Flows create hierarchical execution trees tracked via `ExecutionTree` with tags for observability.

### Extension System

Extensions hook into lifecycle events:

```go
type Extension interface {
    Name() string
    Order() int  // Lower executes first
    Init(scope *Scope) error
    Wrap(ctx context.Context, next func() (any, error), op *Operation) (any, error)
    OnFlowStart(execCtx *ExecutionCtx, flow AnyFlow) error
    OnFlowEnd(execCtx *ExecutionCtx, result any, err error) error
    OnFlowPanic(execCtx *ExecutionCtx, panicVal any, stack []byte) error
    OnError(err error, op *Operation, scope *Scope)
    OnCleanupError(err *CleanupError) bool
    Dispose(scope *Scope) error
}
```

Built-in extensions in `extensions/`: `LoggingExtension`

### Integration Patterns

**CLI Applications**: Short-lived scope per command execution (see examples/cli-tasks/)
**HTTP Servers**: Long-lived scope across all requests (see examples/http-api/)

**Critical difference**: HTTP servers benefit from caching (services resolved once), CLI apps don't (new scope each run).

See INTEGRATION_PATTERNS.md for detailed side-by-side comparison, when caching matters, and hybrid worker patterns.

### Testing with Presets

Replace executors with test doubles using `WithPreset(original, replacement)`. Replacement can be a value or another executor.

## Code Generation

The `codegen/` directory generates `Derive1-5` and `Flow0-5` functions to reduce boilerplate:

```bash
go run codegen/main.go
```

Regenerate when adding new Derive/Flow arities.

## Examples Structure

- `examples/basic/`: Executor fundamentals, reactivity, controllers, tags
- `examples/health-monitor/`: Production health monitoring service
- `examples/order-processing/`: Flow execution with context trees
- `examples/http-api/`: REST API with DI (long-lived scope pattern)
- `examples/cli-tasks/`: CLI app with services (short-lived scope pattern)

Each example follows the pattern:
```
main.go          # Entry point, scope creation, dispatch
graph/graph.go   # Executor definitions (wiring layer)
services/        # Business logic (no pumped-go imports)
handlers/        # HTTP handlers OR commands/ for CLI
```

## Common Patterns

### Resource Cleanup

Use `ctx.OnCleanup(func() error {...})` in executor factories. Cleanup is called when reactive dependents are invalidated or scope is disposed.

### Execution Context and Tags

`ExecutionCtx` provides: `Set()`, `Get()`, `GetFromParent()`, `GetFromScope()`, `Lookup()` (tries self → parents → scope).

Built-in tags: `FlowName()`, `Status()`, `StartTime()`, `EndTime()`, `ErrorTag()`, `Input()`, `Output()`

### Parallel Flow Execution

Use `execCtx.Parallel()` with `WithCollectErrors()` or `WithFailFast()`.

## Release Process

We use semantic versioning with conventional commits:

```
feat: New feature (MINOR bump)
fix: Bug fix (PATCH bump)
perf: Performance improvement
docs: Documentation
test: Test changes
ci: CI/CD changes
refactor: Code refactoring
BREAKING CHANGE: (MAJOR bump)
```

To create a release:

1. Run full CI: `devbox run ci`
2. Test release locally: `devbox run release-snapshot`
3. Commit and push
4. Create and push tag:
   ```bash
   git tag -a v0.x.0 -m "Release v0.x.0"
   git push origin v0.x.0
   ```

GitHub Actions automatically handles building, signing, and releasing.

## Thread Safety

All operations are thread-safe:
- Scopes use `sync.RWMutex` for concurrent access
- Controllers can be used from multiple goroutines
- Cache uses `sync.Map` for concurrent operations
- Flows can execute in parallel via `Parallel()`

## Important Notes

- **Never import pumped-go in business logic** (services/) - keep it in main.go, graph/, handlers/commands/
- **Use Reactive sparingly** - default to Static unless you need hot reload/dynamic updates
- **Lazy is for optional dependencies** - won't resolve unless explicitly accessed
- **Extensions execute in order** - lower `Order()` values run first, wrap in reverse order
- **Execution tree has a limit** - default 1000 nodes, oldest roots evicted (see `newExecutionTree`)
