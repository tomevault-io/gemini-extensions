> AGH is an agent operating system — a Go single-binary daemon that manages AI agent sessions via ACP (Agent Client Protocol). It spawns ACP-compatible agents (Claude Code, OpenClaw, Hermes, etc.) as subprocesses, communicates via JSON-RPC over stdio, persists events in SQLite, and exposes interfaces via HTTP/SSE (web UI) and UDS (CLI). A Fumadocs site at `agh.network` documents the runtime and the AGH Network protocol.

## Project Overview

AGH is an agent operating system — a Go single-binary daemon that manages AI agent sessions via ACP (Agent Client Protocol). It spawns ACP-compatible agents (Claude Code, OpenClaw, Hermes, etc.) as subprocesses, communicates via JSON-RPC over stdio, persists events in SQLite, and exposes interfaces via HTTP/SSE (web UI) and UDS (CLI). A Fumadocs site at `agh.network` documents the runtime and the AGH Network protocol.

**Goals**: daemon single-binary in background, strong observability, agent-first system (agents manipulate via CLI + REST), highly extensible, highly configurable.

**Core product premise**: every capability must be both extensible by the runtime and manageable by agents. Features are incomplete if they only work through internal Go calls or the web UI.

## Greenfield Alpha — Zero Legacy Tolerance

- **No production users exist.**
- Never sacrifice code quality for backward compatibility.
- Never write migration, compatibility, or defensive code for old state — delete obsolete code instead of working around it.
- **Hard cuts, not bridges:**
  - Renames must update code, storage, APIs, CLI, extensions, specs, RFCs, and `.compozy/tasks/*` artifacts all in a single change.
  - Do not create aliases, dual fields, or schema fallback paths.
- Every breaking-change techspec **MUST** explicitly list its delete targets.

## Critical Rules

- **`make verify` MUST pass** before completing ANY task (runs `codegen-check → bun-lint → bun-typecheck → bun-test → web-build → fmt → lint → test → build → boundaries` across the entire monorepo, not just `web/`). Zero warnings, zero errors. Exceptions are just if you just update documentation that don't affect test, lint or typecheck.
- **`make lint` (Go golangci-lint) and `make bun-lint` (oxfmt + oxlint over every workspace) both have zero tolerance** — any warning or lint issue is a blocking failure.
- **Check dependent package APIs** before writing integration code or tests.
- **Never add dependencies by hand in `go.mod`** — always use `go get`.
- **Never run destructive git commands** (`git restore`, `git checkout`, `git reset`, `git clean`, `git rm`) **without explicit user permission**. If the worktree contains unexpected edits, read and work around them.
- <critical>NEVER ignore errors with `_` in production code or in tests — every error must be handled or have a written justification.</critical>
- **Test placement is mandatory before test creation.** Before adding, moving, or expanding any test, name the invariant, owning layer, and canonical suite. Default to editing an existing canonical suite; do not create standalone or duplicate regression tests unless no existing suite can own that invariant. Static/prose/CSS/generated/snapshot/config tests require explicit product-contract rationale.
- **Static-artifact tests are exceptional.** Forbidden by default: Storybook setup/config/globs/decorators/bootstrap, CI workflow/action YAML, Mage/Make/package-script plumbing, generic config/file existence, generated-output drift, snapshots/goldens, prose/CSS literals, and coverage-padding. Prefer stronger gates (`make verify`, `make codegen-check`, builds, link checks, Storybook visual capture, or real command smoke). Coverage floors never justify filler tests.
- <critical>NEVER COMMITS `ai-docs/` or `.tmp/` TO THE REPO. They are local tracking artifacts.</critical>
- **Always use subagents for exploration** to avoid bloating your own context. Route by shape:
  - **Single-file lookup or one targeted question** ("where is X defined?", "which files reference Y?") → `Explore` subagent (read-only, returns excerpts inline).
  - **Multi-area research that needs written analysis artifacts** (3+ distinct slices, cross-cutting question, output must persist for a TechSpec / ADR / task) → activate the `agent-exploration` skill, which scouts the territory, dispatches N `explorer` subagents in parallel under the scoped-write contract, and synthesizes `summary.md`.
  - **Competitor / reference-repo research** against `.resources/<repo>/` → activate `cy-research-competitors` (the specialized variant) instead of `agent-exploration`.
- **Subagents default to read-only.** Use them for analysis, exploration, and parallel research. The author of every code change is the agent paired with the user, and subagent output is treated as evidence. A subagent may write, edit, or commit only when the parent's prompt explicitly delegates that action (e.g. "write the analysis file at X", "apply the fix in Y"); otherwise it must return its output for the parent to write.
- **ALWAYS CHECK** the `internal/CLAUDE.md` when doing Go-related stuff
- **ALWAYS CHECK** the `web/CLAUDE.md` when doing things related to the web package

## Workflow Rules

These govern how features move from idea to ship. Internalize them before opening a TechSpec or running a task.

- **Multi-LLM pipeline is the default dev model.** Codex (`gpt-5.4` with `reasoning_effort=xhigh`) authors specs; Claude Opus pressure-tests them; `gpt-5.4-mini` with `reasoning_effort=high` does parallel breadth exploration when explicitly delegated. Do not substitute models without explicit user approval.
- **TechSpec peer review is opt-in and happens after draft approval.** `cy-create-techspec` must first present the complete draft, get the user's approval on that draft, and save `_techspec.md`. Only then should the agent ask whether to run `cy-spec-peer-review`. If the user opts in, run `compozy exec --ide claude --model opus --reasoning-effort xhigh --format json --prompt-file <prompt>`, summarize blockers/nits/readiness, ask which findings to incorporate, apply only the selected findings, and ask whether to run another round or stop.
- **Every backend task carries a `Web/Docs Impact` subitem.** List affected `web/` routes/components/hooks AND `packages/site` doc pages. Backend-only tasks may declare "no impact" but only after analysis.
- **Every spec/feature carries an extensibility + agent-manageability + config lifecycle analysis.** Creating, updating, or removing a feature MUST state how it integrates with AGH extensibility surfaces (extensions, hooks, skills/capabilities, tools/resources, bundles, registries, bridge SDKs), which CLI/HTTP/UDS surfaces let agents manage it, and whether `config.toml` keys/defaults/docs are added, changed, or removed. "No impact" is acceptable only with explicit evidence.
- **Reference competitors by file path in tasks.** When a TechSpec relies on `.resources/<repo>/` references, generated tasks must include explicit competitor file paths so implementing agents read them too. Reference-bearing analysis files belong under `.compozy/tasks/<slug>/analysis/`.
- **Worktree isolation is mandatory for parallel QA.** Concurrent runs use unique `AGH_HOME`, unique daemon ports, and unique `tmux-bridge` socket paths. Default home/port use is forbidden when concurrency is signaled.
- **Deterministic QA bootstrap is mandatory for local release/scenario QA.** Start with `agh-qa-bootstrap`, create a fresh lab for each new QA pass by default, and reuse a `bootstrap-manifest.json` only when continuing the same active QA session/loop.
- **Provider-home policy must match the provider contract during local QA.** Bound-secret and brokered QA credentials use `PROVIDER_HOME` and `PROVIDER_CODEX_HOME` from the bootstrap manifest. Exception: `native_cli` providers with `home_policy = operator` (for example direct Claude Code on the operator machine) must preserve the operator `HOME` / native login state unless a scenario explicitly tests isolated provider-home behavior.
- **Isolated Web QA must export `AGH_WEB_API_PROXY_TARGET`.** When the daemon is not on the default `:2123`, derive the proxy target from the bootstrap manifest/env instead of hardcoding localhost defaults.
- **Never parallelize config writes against one isolated QA home.** `agh config set` and similar config mutations must run sequentially when they target the same provider or runtime home.
- **Skill helpers must use explicit repo-root paths.** Do not write or execute ambiguous `scripts/...` helper paths when the helper actually lives under `.agents/skills/<skill>/scripts/`.
- **Two-touch rule.** If the same package or behavior has been patched twice in the same workstream, the third change MUST be a structural redesign, not a third patch. Open a new TechSpec.
- **Conversation in Brazilian Portuguese; artifacts in English.** Spoken/typed exchanges may use BR-PT. TechSpecs, ADRs, code, commit messages, docs are always English.

## AGH Cross-Surface Impact Audit

Every feature, bug fix, refactor, public contract change, CLI/API/native-tool/config/docs update, or runtime behavior change MUST include an `AGH Impact Audit` in the plan, task body, review-fix notes, or completion notes. Purely editorial docs may state `not applicable — editorial only` only when they do not describe runtime behavior.

Use this exact four-row shape:

```markdown
AGH Impact Audit:

- Native tools: <changed tool IDs/toolsets/descriptors/schema digests/capability gates/tests, or no impact with checked surfaces>
- Extensibility and hooks: <extensions, hooks, skills/capabilities, tools/resources, bundles, registries, bridge SDKs, MCP sidecars, config lifecycle, or no impact with checked surfaces>
- Workspace data isolation: <global/workspace/session/agent scope decision, workspace_id propagation through CLI/HTTP/UDS/core/store/web/SSE/cache/events, tests, or no impact with checked surfaces>
- Official AGH skill: <skills/agh/SKILL.md or skills/agh/references/\*.md updates, or no impact with checked surfaces>
```

Audit rules:

- `No impact` is valid only when the artifact names the exact checked surfaces and why they remain unchanged.
- **Native tools** includes `agh__*` IDs, toolsets, descriptors, input/output schemas, schema digests, risk flags, availability diagnostics, capability gates, and CLI/API fallbacks used by agents.
- **Extensibility and hooks** includes extension manifests/resources, hook taxonomy and dispatch call sites, skill/capability declarations, tools/resources, bundles, registries, bridge SDKs, MCP sidecars, `config.toml` lifecycle, docs, and tests.
- **Workspace data isolation** is runtime data ownership, not QA/worktree isolation. Decide whether each new or changed datum is global, workspace-scoped, session-scoped, or agent-scoped; prove list/read/cache/SSE/event paths cannot leak data across workspaces when the surface crosses those boundaries.
- **Official AGH skill** updates are required when public behavior, tool IDs, CLI paths, hook events, capabilities, bundles/resources, memory/network/task semantics, or agent guidance changes. The canonical bundled skill lives under `skills/agh/`.

## Design System

**`packages/ui/src/tokens.css` is the canonical runtime token source. `DESIGN.md` is the generated design-system specification plus stable rationale for every AGH surface** — runtime UI, marketing site, and docs. Any UI or asset work MUST:

- Pull values from `packages/ui/src/tokens.css` and the generated `DESIGN.md` tables/frontmatter (colors, type, radii, spacing, motion) — never invent values.
- Keep site-only theme extensions in `packages/site/app/global.css` `@theme inline`; run `make codegen` after changing runtime or site theme tokens so `DESIGN.md` is regenerated.
- Never hand-edit `DESIGN.md` frontmatter or `<!-- BEGIN:tokens:* -->` / `<!-- END:tokens:* -->` regions. Use `scripts/sync-design-md.mjs --write`; `make codegen-check` enforces drift.
- Follow the flat depth model: warm-dark surface ramp, tokenized hairlines, no decorative freehand shadows. Use only exported `--shadow-*` tokens where the system explicitly defines overlay, highlight, or focus depth.
- Respect the signal palette: accent `#E8572A` = action, `#5FBF85` = success, `#E0635A` = danger, `#D6A647` = warning, `#8E8EB5` = info.
- For design-system or UI redesign tasks, run them through the `designer` agent (`.claude/agents/designer.md`) in **execution mode only** and activate the mandatory design skills listed below.
- **Truthful UI > plausible UI.** Don't render controls or metrics the runtime doesn't actually support. When Paper artboards conflict with daemon truth, daemon wins. Paper governs _composition_, `DESIGN.md` governs _grammar_.

### Using `ui-craft` for design work

`agh-design` (skill body: `.agents/skills/agh/agh-design/SKILL.md`) carries brand truth; `ui-craft` is the discipline on top. Activate both for any non-trivial UI pass — designing, generating, reviewing, or refactoring visible surfaces.

- Project token values live in `packages/ui/src/tokens.css`; `DESIGN.md` is generated from those tokens and remains the brand/rationale authority. Both override `ui-craft`'s generic guidance.
- `ui-craft` is reference-routed: match the task to a row in `.agents/skills/ui-craft/SKILL.md` and read the listed reference files **in full before generating any visual output**.
- Mandatory pulls (load JIT, never all at once): `accessibility-floor.md` (any interactive widget), `ai-slop-patterns.md` + `anti-defaults.md` (auditing AI-generated UI), `component-patterns.md` (pattern selection), `microcopy-quality.md` (user-visible text), `motion-patterns.md` (animation), `human-ai-ux.md` (chat/agent surfaces), `dark-mode.md` (dark surfaces).

### Verifying UI with `agh-ui-screenshot`

Every UI change in `web/` or `packages/ui/` MUST be visually verified with `agh-ui-screenshot` before completion. Tests verify code, not pixels.

- Capture the matching Storybook story (`components-button--*`, `routes-app-stories-*`, etc.) and diff against a trusted prior baseline.
- For surface-wide passes (token retune, primitive swap), capture before + after.
- Cite the capture file(s) when reporting done. Claiming success without screenshots is non-compliant.

## Copy System

**`COPY.md` (repo root) is the authoritative product-language specification for every AGH surface** - marketing copy, docs prose, release copy, package metadata, UI microcopy, CLI help, and public social/SEO/OpenGraph text. Any product-facing copy work MUST:

- Read `COPY.md` before writing or changing public copy, narrative docs, UI labels, metadata, changelog/release copy, or CLI/help text.
- Treat runtime truth as stronger than copy preference: generated API/CLI references, implemented code, tests, and release artifacts beat aspirational wording.
- Follow `docs/_memory/glossary.md` for canonical terms. The canonical artifact name is `capability`, never `recipe`, `workflow`, `procedure`, or `playbook` for current AGH behavior.
- Keep `DESIGN.md` as the visual authority and `COPY.md` as the verbal/product-language authority.
- Use the `COPY.md` claim standards before saying "today", "shipping", "supported", "live", "complete", or using product counts.

Web-specific skill dispatch is in `web/CLAUDE.md` and `web/AGENTS.md`. Site-specific dispatch is in `packages/site/CLAUDE.md`.

Every domain change requires its skill — no skipping "because it's a small change". Activate multiple skills when code touches multiple domains.

## Build Commands

### Monorepo gate

`make verify` is the only gate that exercises the entire monorepo (Go + every Bun workspace). The targets below let you run individual stages in isolation.

### Bun workspaces (monorepo-wide)

```bash
make bun-lint            # bun run lint at repo root → oxfmt + oxlint over every workspace (zero tolerance)
make bun-typecheck       # bun run typecheck at repo root → turbo run typecheck across @agh/create-extension, @agh/extension-sdk, @agh/site, @agh/ui, agh-web
make bun-test            # bun run tests at repo root → turbo run test across every Bun workspace
```

These three are the bun-side commands the `Verify` gate runs. `make web-lint` is an alias for the repo-root lint gate so web, `packages/ui`, and `packages/site` share the same zero-warning policy. Never substitute the other per-package web shortcuts or `cd packages/site && bun run …` commands when you need a guardrail-quality check — they only cover their own workspace and miss every other Bun package.

Frontend tests MUST run through Turborepo. Do not use `make web-test`, `cd web && bun run test`, `bun run --cwd web test`, `cd packages/site && bun run test`, or package-local equivalents as validation evidence; they bypass Turbo's cache/task graph. For focused iteration, run Turbo from the repo root:

```bash
bunx turbo run test --filter=./web            # agh-web only
bunx turbo run test --filter=./packages/ui    # @agh/ui only
bunx turbo run test --filter=./packages/site  # @agh/site only
```

### Go (backend)

```bash
make lint                # Strict golangci-lint (zero issues)
make test                # Run unit tests with -race flag
make test-integration    # Add -tags integration tests
make test-e2e-runtime    # Daemon-side E2E (Go harness)
make test-e2e-web        # Browser-side E2E (Playwright)
make test-e2e            # Both lanes
make test-e2e-nightly    # Heavy E2E (release PR dry-run only)
make build               # Compile binary
make codegen             # Regenerate openapi/agh.json + web/src/generated/agh-openapi.d.ts + DESIGN.md generated token regions
```

Web (`web/`) workspace-local dev/build/format commands (`make web-dev`, `make web-build`, `make web-fmt`) are documented in `web/CLAUDE.md`. They are scoped to `web/` only. `make web-lint` intentionally runs the repo-root frontend lint gate; for typecheck/test validation use the Turbo-backed commands above, and for the full guardrail use the `make bun-*` targets.

## Commit style

- ALWAYS USE: `<type>: <description>`
- Allowed commit prefixes: `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `build:`
- **Do NOT use**: `chore:`, `style:`, or `ci:`.
- Use `build:` for tooling and CI changes.
- For PR-merged commits, append a `(#NN)` suffix.
- **Create exactly one commit per remediation batch.**
- Each `cy-fix-reviews` round must produce one local commit.
- Always run `make verify` **before and after** committing.
- If a pre-commit hook fails, do **not** use `git commit --amend`. Instead, fix the issue and create a new commit.

## Code Search Hierarchy

1. **Grep / Glob** — for local project code.
2. **`context7` skill** — for external library documentation.
3. **`exa-web-search-free`** — for web research, news, external code examples when the local docs tools are insufficient.

## Surface Map

Repo layout. Each surface owns its instructions:

| Path            | Stack                                                                   | Instructions              |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `cmd/agh`       | Go binary entry point                                                   | `internal/CLAUDE.md`      |
| `internal/`     | Go runtime daemon (ACP, SQLite, autonomy kernel, HTTP/UDS, network)     | `internal/CLAUDE.md`      |
| `web/`          | React 19 SPA (Vite, TanStack, Tailwind, shadcn)                         | `web/CLAUDE.md`           |
| `packages/site` | Fumadocs documentation site (Bun)                                       | `packages/site/CLAUDE.md` |
| `packages/ui`   | Shared UI primitives (`@agh/ui`) consumed by `web/` and `packages/site` | `web/CLAUDE.md`           |

Backend architecture, autonomy contracts, security invariants, package layout, and `internal/`-specific debugging now live in **`internal/CLAUDE.md`**. Open it before touching any Go code under `cmd/` or `internal/`.

## Coding Style

- **Skill**: `agh-code-guidelines` (`.agents/skills/agh-code-guidelines/`).
- **When**: before writing or editing any production `*.go` file under `cmd/` or `internal/`.
- **Covers**: error wrapping (`%w`), `errors.Is`/`As` only, `slog` logging, `context.Context` discipline, compile-time interface assertions, no hardcoded config, CLI flag presence detection, comments policy, generic concurrency patterns.
- **Top-level invariants restated in Critical Rules**: no `_`-discarded errors, `make verify` must pass, `make lint` zero tolerance.

## Testing

- **Skill**: `consolidate-test-suites` (`.agents/skills/consolidate-test-suites/`).
- **When**: before creating a new test file, moving a test, broadening a regression suite, or adding tests primarily to satisfy a task checklist or coverage target.
- **Covers**: invariant naming, owning-layer selection, canonical-suite reuse, duplicate regression rejection, and no-new-test rationale when an existing gate already proves the behavior.
- **Rule**: every task needs a test decision, not necessarily new tests. Do not add filler tests for coverage or tests that only pin implementation details.
- **Static artifacts**: allow tests over generated/static/tooling files only when the artifact itself is the product, operator, agent, security, or release contract and no stronger gate owns the invariant. Any surviving static-artifact test should make that contract obvious in the test name or a short `KEEP:` comment.
- **Skill**: `agh-test-conventions` (`.agents/skills/agh-test-conventions/`).
- **When**: before writing or editing any `*_test.go` file.
- **Covers**:
  - `t.Run("Should ...")` subtests, `t.Parallel` default (with `t.Setenv` opt-out), table-driven layout.
  - Status-code + body assertions (status-code-only is insufficient).
  - `-race` / `CGO_ENABLED=1` discipline; Linux-Race CI parity for race-sensitive packages.
  - Integration / E2E build tags (`//go:build integration`, `make test-integration`, `make test-e2e-runtime`, `make test-e2e-web`).
  - Runtime-contract co-ship (E2E mock + matchers ship with contract changes).
  - 80% coverage floor per package.
  - Commit-gate semantics (`make verify` blocks; test failures are production bugs).

### Schema Migrations

- **Skill**: `agh-schema-migration`.
- **When**: any SQLite column, index, or constraint change.
- **Mandatory**: numbered migration in the registry — `EnsureSchema`-style boot reconciliation is forbidden for column changes.
- **Append-only identity**: migration `version`, `name`, and `checksum` are persisted data contracts. Never insert, reorder, rename, renumber, or change an existing migration after it may have reached any developer, QA, or release database; append new migrations at the registry tail.
- **Integrity mismatch response**: stop and investigate the recorded history. Fix the registry order or write an ADR-backed one-pass repair; never weaken mismatch checks and never manually edit a live `schema_migrations` row as the fix.
- **Covers**: numbered registry, transactional wrap (`BEGIN IMMEDIATE`), `-wal` / `-shm` companion handling on recovery, `ORDER BY 0` pitfall, fresh-DB + reopen-after-restart tests.

## Memory & Lessons Learned

`docs/_memory/` is the project's institutional memory — durable engineering knowledge distilled from real incidents, ADR forensics, and standing engineering posture. Treat it as authoritative when CLAUDE.md is silent or ambiguous.

- **Standing directives** — `docs/_memory/standing_directives.md`. Perpetually-active engineering posture (SD-001..SD-011): long-running session supervision, greenfield-delete, BR-PT/EN, multi-LLM pipeline, real-scenario QA, forensic-first bug fixes, truthful UI, composition-root discipline, detached lifetime, extensible-and-agent-manageable design. Read before opening a TechSpec, defending an architecture pivot, or whenever someone proposes a compat shim.
- **Spec authoring playbook** — `docs/_memory/spec-authoring-playbook.md`. Mandatory preflight for `cy-create-prd` / `cy-create-techspec` / `cy-create-tasks`, with phase-by-phase MUST / MUST-NOT and evidence references. The `cy-spec-preflight` skill enforces this — always read before producing any `_idea.md` / `_prd.md` / `_techspec.md` / `_tasks.md`.
- **Lessons learned** — `docs/_memory/lessons/` (`L-001..L-021`, plus `README.md` index). One file per durable lesson with confirmed root cause + fix + evidence (ADR, commit, review issue, or QA bug). Scan the index whenever you hit a class of issue: concurrency / API, testing discipline, autonomy architecture, persistence, spec authoring.
- **Glossary** — `docs/_memory/glossary.md`. Canonical vocabulary (`capability` vs `recipe`, `AGENT.md` vs `AGENTS.md`, Peer Card vs Agent Card, autonomy primitives). Authoritative when older RFCs / ledgers conflict. Read when naming anything new, reviewing a rename PR, or when a term feels overloaded.
- **Cross-source synthesis** — `docs/_memory/_synthesis.md`. Cross-referenced findings from 8 forensic analyses, ranked by source count — the evidence corpus behind every rule in CLAUDE.md and the standing directives. Read when challenging or evolving a rule.
- **Forensic analyses** — `docs/_memory/analysis/analysis_*.md`. Per-source raw analyses (codex sessions / plans / ledger, compozy tasks, qmd collections, local / global runs, existing surfaces) feeding `_synthesis.md`. Read when synthesis cites a finding and you need the underlying evidence.

**Authoring rules:**

- New lesson → numbered file `L-NNN-kebab-title.md` + update `lessons/README.md`. One lesson per file. Cite specific evidence (file path, commit, review issue, ledger entry). Activate the `lesson-learned` skill.
- Don't duplicate CLAUDE.md or `standing_directives.md` rules in lessons — lessons explain **why** a rule exists; rules go in their respective files.
- Don't add speculative warnings — only confirmed incidents with evidence.
- New standing directive → next `SD-NNN` block in `standing_directives.md` with Posture / Required behavior / Source / Triggers re-evaluation when.
