This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an end-to-end display latency measurement tool. It measures the time from a mouse click to visible screen change using custom hardware (photodiode + RP2040 microcontroller). The system has three layers: firmware, host software, and hardware.

## Architecture

**Measurement flow:** The RP2040 sends a USB HID mouse click → the click causes a brightness change in the application on the monitor under test (any app works if the brightness difference is big enough) → photodiode detects the change → ADC samples are sent over serial → `main.py` logs to CSV → `analyze.py` calculates latency.

### Firmware (`arduino/arduino.ino`)
- Board-agnostic within arduino-pico: it needs an ADC input on `A1` (GP27), USB HID, and a NeoPixel status LED. Default FQBN is `rp2040:rp2040:waveshare_rp2040_zero` (the PCB's module); the QT Py perfboard build is `FQBN=rp2040:rp2040:adafruit_qtpy ./flash_rp2040.sh`. `NEOPIXEL_POWER` (a switched NeoPixel rail, QT Py only) is `#ifdef`-guarded, but `PIN_NEOPIXEL` is not — variants without a NeoPixel (`generic`, `rpipico`) don't define it and won't compile as-is
- `analogReadResolution(14)` on pin A1 reads the photodiode via a transimpedance amplifier (fab board: VBPW34S + TLV9061; perfboard: BPW34 + TLC271IP). The RP2040 SAR is 12-bit, so the 14-bit range is upscaled — the extra bits add range, not resolution
- Dark baseline differs per sensor: ~565 ADC counts on the fab PCB, ~950 on the perfboard build — harmless, since `analyze.py`'s midpoint detection measures both reference levels from each row's own samples
- Collects 12,000 ADC samples per test run with 20µs settling delay between reads (~288ms window), sends as CSV-prefixed serial line
- Uses `Mouse16.press()`/`Mouse16.release()` instead of a blocking click — press is non-blocking (~15µs), sampling starts immediately
- Two measurement modes: click (default) and move. Move mode fires a single atomic mouse-move report — 1–32767 HID counts (default 127), direction u/d/l/r with HID Y positive-down (default right). Distances beyond ±127 are never chained (chaining would smear the input edge across multiple 1ms polls); instead the firmware replaces the stock Mouse library with its own HID device (`mouse16.h`/`mouse16.cpp`, class `Mouse16Device`, global instance `Mouse16`) whose descriptor declares 16-bit relative X/Y axes, like real gaming mice — registered at runtime via `USB.registerHIDDevice()` with the same ordering/pidMask as the stock library so USB enumeration is unchanged, and the report ID kept at descriptor byte offset 6 where the core rewrites it. `Mouse16.move()` mirrors the stock `Mouse_::move()` (same mutex/`tud_task`/`HIDReady` guard, one `tud_hid_report`, ~15-20µs), so the CSV `clickTime` field keeps its semantics for both press and move. Because the sketch no longer includes the stock `Mouse.h`, `mouse16.cpp` has to include `<tusb-hid.h>` itself on arduino-pico ≥ 5.5.0 — that release moved the TinyUSB HID class driver out of the prebuilt `libpico.a` into a dummy library, leaving only weak no-op stubs in the core, so without the include the link fails with undefined `tud_hid_n_report`/`tud_hid_n_ready`; the include is version-guarded on `ARDUINO_PICO_MAJOR`/`MINOR` since the library doesn't exist on 5.4.x. The inverse move restores the cursor after the CSV dump + `Serial.flush()` (capture is long over by then; the inter-run delay provides settle time) — running inside `runTest()` means `stop` can never strand the cursor displaced. Settings are RAM-only like interval/clicks. Serial commands: `mc`/`mm` (mode), `x<1-32767>` (distance), `r<u|d|l|r>` (direction), `t` (move test: move + 1s hold + inverse move, for visually checking the distance). The Vulkan color-switcher stays click-only
- 20µs ADC settling delay is critical: without it, the sample-and-hold capacitor doesn't fully discharge, compressing dynamic range (black reads ~1238 instead of ~950)
- `usb_hid_poll_interval = 1` overrides arduino-pico's weak default of 10 — a 10ms HID bInterval would add a uniform 0-10ms host-poll delay to every measurement; 1ms matches a 1000Hz gaming mouse
- The residual 0-1ms poll wait is measured, not guessed: press/move only queues the report, so after firing, `Mouse16.waitDelivered()` busy-waits (`tud_task()` + `tud_hid_ready()` under `USB.mutex` — the mutex is the core's `tud_task()` reentrancy guard, its 1ms IRQ pump try-enters and defers while user code owns it; device-local only, no bus traffic) until the host's IN token actually picked it up, and the elapsed µs go out as the trailing `deliveryTime` CSV field (0 = never delivered, 5ms timeout; `analyze.py` drops such rows). The wait sits *between* the sampling phases, never inside them — `analyze.py` timestamps by index × average sample period, so pumping `tud_task()` inside the sampling loop would skew every crossing; the ≤1ms sample gap right after the press is before the input even reached the host. Clicks stay µs-jittered (measure-don't-align: re-timing the press onto the 1ms SOF grid would re-quantize click phase vs. scanout, the exact correlation the jitter exists to destroy)
- Inter-click delay carries ±10ms of random jitter, generated in µs (whole-ms offsets modulo a 2ms frame period would only hit two scanout phases). `randomSeed()` is seeded from ADC noise, otherwise every session would repeat the same jitter sequence
- `Serial.flush()` after each CSV line ensures USB bus is idle before next measurement (HID and CDC share the bus)
- Serial protocol: lines starting with `CSV` are data rows, `META` (sent on session start) carries the session settings as `key=value` pairs (`mode`, plus `distance`/`direction` in move mode, and `firmware`), `DONE` ends a session, all other output is debug/status

### Host Control Software (`main.py`)
- Async serial terminal using `prompt_toolkit` for interactive control
- Auto-detects the device by USB VID/PID at 115200 baud: exact matches first (`KNOWN_DEVICES` — 0x239A/0x80F7 for the QT Py, plus the 0x2E8A PID set arduino-pico derives from 0x0003 depending on which USB interfaces are enabled), then any port with a known vendor ID (Adafruit 0x239A, Raspberry Pi 0x2E8A) for firmware builds with an unlisted PID; falls back to `/dev/cu.usbmodem*`/`/dev/ttyACM*` name matching, then to any port whose driver description says "USB Serial" (Windows names CDC devices `USB Serial Device (COMx)`). Pass a port as first CLI arg to override (`uv run main.py /dev/ttyACM1`, `uv run main.py COM5`). Ports are re-scanned on every connect, so Linux re-enumeration (ttyACM0 → ttyACM1) is handled automatically.
- Runs on macOS, Linux and Windows. Windows specifics: COM ports are opened exclusively, so a dead handle is closed before every reconnect (`discard_serial`); `csv.field_size_limit` is capped at 2³¹−1 because a C `long` is 32-bit there; session CSVs resolve against the script directory, not the cwd.
- Commands: `start`, `stop`, `debug`/`d`, `interval <n>`/`i <n>`, `clicks <n>`/`c <n>`, `mode <click|move>`/`m <...>`, `distance <1-32767>`/`x <n>`, `direction <up|down|left|right>`/`r <...>`, `test`/`t` (visible move + 1s hold + reset), `connect`, `disconnect`
- CSV output goes to `output/` with timestamp-based filenames. The firmware's `META` payload is written into the session CSV as a `#` comment line (after the header, before the first data row), so each file records which mode produced it; old firmware sends no `META` and its files stay unchanged

### Data Processing
- `analyze.py`: Latency analyzer with automatic per-row normalized-crossing detection. Per CSV row: takes the median of the last 200 pre-click samples as baseline and the median of the last 500 samples as the settled level (medians reject QD-OLED flicker dips), measures noise as the peak-to-peak of the last 1000 pre-click samples, skips rows whose swing doesn't clear 2× that noise (missed click / slipped sensor; skip reasons are counted), and timestamps normalized crossings of the swing: t50 (primary latency — 5-sample sustained crossing, timestamped at the run's first sample) plus supplementary t10 (onset; per-row unavailable when 10% of the swing is within the noise, e.g. QD-OLED white-baseline flicker) and t90 (first crossing, no sustain since settled flicker recrosses it). Displays with strong temporal light modulation (TLM — the umbrella term for any periodic luminance variation; a PWM backlight like the MacBook Pro mini-LED's ~3kHz strobe and a deep QD-OLED per-refresh brightness dip at the refresh rate are the same signal to the photodiode, so the check is named for the signal property, not one cause) are handled by a per-row pre-detection check: when the noisier reference window is strongly periodic (autocorrelation ≥ 0.8 at its best local maximum, smallest lag among near-equal peaks so multiples of the fundamental don't win) and the oscillation peak-to-peak reaches past the midpoint of the raw swing, detection runs on a symmetric exactly-one-modulation-period moving average (half-weight end taps for even periods) — every row of such a display goes through the same filter regardless of direction, counted in a `flicker:` report line with the modulation frequency (which tells you the cause: kHz range → backlight PWM, ≈ refresh rate → OLED refresh flicker). Sub-midpoint flicker and steady displays never trip the gate (verified: no `test_run1` window comes near the periodicity threshold — note that deep QD-OLED refresh flicker *can* legitimately trip it, seen on an AW2725DF at 360Hz whose white-level dips exceeded half the swing), so clean-display results stay bit-identical. All ranking stats use t50 only — self-scaling across hardware generations (fab PCB ~2800-unit swing, perfboard ~390) with no tuning, and per-row, so results don't depend on what's pooled together. `-t <delta>` switches to the legacy m2p-latency fixed delta-from-baseline scan (mean baseline, single-sample crossing), kept bit-identical for reproducing published numbers (e.g. `test_run1/` was published with `-t 100`; note t50 reads ~0.5ms slower there, since it crosses at ~195 counts instead of 100). Reports the detection mode with min/median signal-to-noise separation, mean (± 95% margin of error), median, p5, p95, p95−p5 spread, min, max, median onset (t10) and sensor+panel response (t10→t90), plus an ASCII histogram (0.5ms bins). Arguments can be CSV files or folders: a folder is scanned recursively for `.csv` files and pooled into one result, with the margin of error design-effect adjusted across files (each file = one session); single files get the naive 1.96·sd/√n margin. Terminal output only, no plotting (the histogram bar falls back from `█` to `#` when stdout can't encode it, e.g. redirected output on Windows). `--json` prints the stats as a JSON array instead; the stats logic is importable via `collect_stats()`. `#` comment lines in a CSV are skipped by the parser and parsed as session metadata (`key=value` pairs); when any pooled file carries metadata, the report and JSON gain a `mode:` line listing the modes present — files without metadata count as `unknown`, so a mixed folder can't silently claim a single mode. Files without comment lines (all pre-metadata captures) produce bit-identical output. Timestamps are press-referenced by default; on captures with a `deliveryTime` column that reference is exact (the recorded press→USB-pickup wait replaces `clickTime` as both the sampling-pause correction and the timestamp origin, in legacy `-t` mode too), and a `delivery:` report line always shows the wait's median/min/max as a diagnostic. `--from-delivery` (also on `analyze_all.py`; rejected together with `-t`, whose guarantee is reproducing published press-referenced numbers) re-references latencies to the USB pickup — mean drops by the ~0.5ms average wait and the spread tightens, the sharper view for display A/B comparisons, vs. the default button-to-photon view that matches what a user feels. Rows with `deliveryTime` 0 (report never picked up — host suspended) are always dropped, and rows lacking the column under `--from-delivery`, as skip reason `no-delivery`, so pooling old and new captures can't mix timestamp origins.
- `analyze_all.py`: chart-JSON wrapper — analyzes every direct subfolder of a given folder (`uv run analyze_all.py test_run/output`) via `collect_stats()` and prints chart-ready JSON with two top-level keys: `main` (labels = subfolder names, datasets = median/margin of error/p5/p95, sorted fastest median first) and `histogram` (0.5ms bins shared across all cases; labels = bin lower edges in ms, one dataset of counts per case).
- `analyze.md`: plain-language explanation of every field in the `analyze.py` report (what mean ± CI, p5/p95, spread and the histogram actually mean). Keep it in sync when the report changes.
- `test_run1/`: reference captures plus `test_setup.md` (machine, monitor, package versions) and `test_matrix.md` (X11/Wayland × `PROTON_DXVK_LOWLATENCY` × VRR — 8 cases plus 4 special ones). Perfboard-era data; auto midpoint detection handles it, `-t 100` reproduces the originally published numbers.

### Hardware (`hardware/`)
- `pcb/`: KiCad 10 project for the fab board — 30 × 48 mm, TLV9061 TIA + VBPW34S photodiode on the front (JLCPCB-assembled), solder-on Waveshare RP2040-Zero module on the back so the sensor face stays ~1 mm flat against the screen. Custom symbols in `frameprobe.kicad_sym`, footprints in `frameprobe.pretty/`, 3D models in `3dmodels/`, renders `render_top.png` / `render_back.png`, `frameprobe.stl`. TIA output lands on GP27 = A1, so `analogRead(A1)` is unchanged from the perfboard build.
- `./export_fab.sh` regenerates everything fab-related into `hardware/pcb/production/` (gerber zip, BOM, CPL, netlist, ERC/DRC reports) plus the STEP/STL and renders, aborting on any ERC/DRC violation. It needs `kicad-cli` (falls back to the macOS app bundle path). `production/` is gitignored — the fab outputs are generated, not checked in.
- `enclosure/`: 3D-printable case, lid and strap buckle
- `images/`: photos of the assembled board and enclosure (`board.jpg`, `enclosure_front.jpg`, `enclosure_back.jpg`, `enclosure_render.jpg`)

### Firmware compile and flash
```
./flash_rp2040.sh                                     # RP2040-Zero (default FQBN), auto-detects the port
FQBN=rp2040:rp2040:adafruit_qtpy ./flash_rp2040.sh    # other board
./flash_rp2040.sh /dev/ttyACM1                        # or pass the port explicitly
# Installs the rp2040 core and the Adafruit NeoPixel library on first run.
# Builds into ./build/ (gitignored). arduino-cli reboots the board into BOOTSEL
# by opening the port at 1200 baud, which only works if the firmware already on
# the board implements the touch reset -- a factory board (MicroPython, Pico SDK
# demo) does not. When that fails, or when no port shows up at all, the script
# prompts for the BOOT button and copies the .uf2 to the RPI-RP2 drive itself
# (BOOTSEL_TIMEOUT=60 seconds by default). A board already in BOOTSEL is detected
# up front and flashed directly, without touching the serial port.
# or manually (the rp2040:rp2040 core comes from a third-party index, not Arduino's default):
arduino-cli core install rp2040:rp2040 --additional-urls https://github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-pico/releases/download/global/package_rp2040_index.json
arduino-cli lib install "Adafruit NeoPixel"

## CSV Format

```
clickTime,timeTaken,sampleCount,preClickSamples,samples,deliveryTime
# mode=move,distance=500,direction=right,firmware=1.3.0
20,721453,12000,2000,1280;1284;1284;...,953
```

- The `#` line is optional session metadata (`key=value` pairs from the firmware's `META` line, written by `main.py`); files recorded before it existed simply don't have it
- `clickTime`: microseconds for the Mouse16.press() (click mode) or Mouse16.move() (move mode) call (~15-20µs)
- `timeTaken`: total capture duration in microseconds — sampling plus the press and delivery-wait pauses; `analyze.py` subtracts the pause (`deliveryTime`, or `clickTime` on old captures) before dividing by `sampleCount` for the per-sample period
- `sampleCount`: total number of ADC samples
- `preClickSamples`: number of samples collected before the mouse click (pre-click baseline)
- `samples`: semicolon-separated 14-bit ADC values (0-16383)
- `deliveryTime` (firmware ≥ 1.3.0): microseconds from the press call until the host's USB poll actually picked the report up; 0 = never delivered (row dropped). Deliberately the *last* column, appended after `samples`: rows logged by an older `main.py` under its 5-name header then degrade to an ignored extra field instead of silently shifting every column
