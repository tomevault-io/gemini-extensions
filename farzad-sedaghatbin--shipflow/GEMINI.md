`/Users/farzad/.claude/plans/smooth-shimmying-catmull.md`

### Mandatory end-of-session checklist
Every session must complete ALL of these before creating the PR:

1. Add entry to `CHANGELOG.md` under `[Unreleased]`
2. Update `README.md` if user-visible feature added — **refresh screenshots if UI changed**
3. Update `COMPETITOR_ANALYSIS.md` if this closes a gap vs Linear/Jira/Asana
4. Add highlight card to `frontend/src/pages/ReleaseNotes.tsx`
5. Update relevant `*_GUIDE.md` or `CLAUDE.md` if a new repeatable pattern was introduced
6. Add i18n keys to **both** `en.json` AND `fa.json`
7. Write unit or integration tests (JaCoCo gate: ≥ 80% line coverage). **The full suite must be at 0 failures** — if your change breaks existing tests (e.g. serialization format change, renamed field), fix those tests in the same commit before pushing.
8. Update `SampleDataInitializer.java` with demo data for the new feature
9. **If UI layout changed**: verify onboarding tour step selectors in `frontend/src/contexts/TourContext.tsx` still target correct elements. Update both the selector and the **Step Inventory** table in `TOUR_GUIDE.md`. See `TOUR_GUIDE.md` for the full maintenance contract.
10. **Help & Guides — mandatory for every new user-facing feature**: add or update a guide in `backend/src/main/resources/knowledgebase/help-guides/`. Name it `{NN}-{feature}.md` (next sequential number). The file is auto-loaded by `HelpGuideAIService` at startup — no registration needed. If an existing feature's UI changed, update the relevant existing guide. **A feature without a help guide is incomplete.**
11. **If in-app help guides reference changed UI**: update the relevant help guide content
12. **Keep public pages in sync** — `ReleaseNotes.tsx` (`/releases`) and `PublicRoadmap.tsx` (`/public-roadmap`) must always match each other. Any feature added to one must appear in the other. Version cards, item titles, descriptions, and milestone status ("upcoming" / "in-progress" / "planned") must be identical across both pages. See the [Public Pages Alignment rule](#public-pages-alignment) below.
13. Create PR targeting `main` using `feat/fix/chore/refactor/test/docs` prefix

---

## Public Pages Alignment

> **Rule**: `ReleaseNotes.tsx` and `PublicRoadmap.tsx` are two views of the same truth. They must always be in sync.

### The two pages

| Page | Route | Audience | File |
|------|-------|----------|------|
| Release Notes | `/releases` | Anyone — changelog-style list, newest first | `frontend/src/pages/ReleaseNotes.tsx` |
| Public Roadmap | `/public-roadmap` | Anyone — phase view with "in-progress / planned / future" | `frontend/src/pages/PublicRoadmap.tsx` (i18n keys in `en.json` / `fa.json`) |

### What must match between them

1. **Every version milestone** must appear in both pages (e.g. if v1.0.0-rc1 is a card in ReleaseNotes, it must be a phase in PublicRoadmap and vice-versa).
2. **Item titles** for each milestone must be the same (or differ only in phrasing, never in substance).
3. **Item count** should be the same for a given milestone — don't add an item to one page and forget the other.
4. **Milestone status** must be consistent: if a version is marked `upcoming: true` in ReleaseNotes it must be `'in-progress'` or `'planned'` in PublicRoadmap's `upcomingPhases` array, not in `recentlyShipped`.
5. **Newly shipped versions** move from "upcoming/in-progress" to the "recently shipped" section in PublicRoadmap and lose the `upcoming: true` flag in ReleaseNotes — both changes in the same PR.

### When releasing a new version

Run this sub-checklist **in addition to** the main end-of-session checklist:

- [ ] Move the version card in **ReleaseNotes.tsx**: remove `upcoming: true`, set `date` to the real release date (e.g. `'April 19, 2026'`).
- [ ] Move the version in **PublicRoadmap.tsx**: remove from `upcomingPhases`, add to `recentlyShipped` with all highlights.
- [ ] Update the i18n `shipped*` keys in **`en.json`** and **`fa.json`** with the correct title and item descriptions.
- [ ] Verify the hero badge in ReleaseNotes now shows the new version as "Latest".
- [ ] Verify the "In Progress" card in PublicRoadmap now points to the next milestone.

### When adding a feature mid-milestone

- Add it to the **current milestone's** highlights in both pages (same session, same PR).
- If the feature uses i18n keys (PublicRoadmap), add the corresponding hardcoded text in ReleaseNotes to match.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Java 21 (Temurin recommended)
- Node 18 LTS
- Docker (PostgreSQL + Redis via `docker compose`)
- Maven 3.9+

### Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Start infrastructure
docker compose up -d   # PostgreSQL + Redis

# 2. Backend
cd backend
./mvnw spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=dev

# 3. Frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Backend runs on **http://localhost:8080**
Frontend runs on **http://localhost:3000**
Swagger UI: **http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html**

### Environment Variables (dev profile)

```bash
# Database (matches docker-compose defaults)
SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/shipflowdb
SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME=shipflow
SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD=shipflow_secret

# Redis
SPRING_DATA_REDIS_HOST=localhost
SPRING_DATA_REDIS_PORT=6379
SPRING_DATA_REDIS_PASSWORD=changeme

# JWT (configured via app.jwt.secret in application.properties)
APP_JWT_SECRET=your-dev-secret

# LLM (pick one)
OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434          # local
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...                          # OpenAI

# MCP clients (optional)
MCP_GITHUB_ENABLED=true
MCP_GITHUB_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:3000
MCP_FIGMA_ENABLED=true
MCP_FIGMA_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

---

## Build & Test

```bash
# Backend
cd backend
./mvnw verify                  # compile + test + coverage
./mvnw spotless:check          # lint (must pass before commit)
./mvnw spotless:apply          # auto-fix formatting

# Frontend
cd frontend
npm test                       # Vitest unit tests
npm run build                  # production build
npm run storybook              # component explorer
```

**Coverage gate**: 80% line coverage enforced by JaCoCo. Tests must pass before any PR is merged.

> **100% pass rule**: The full test suite must be at 0 failures before every commit. If an infrastructure change (e.g. adding `@EnableSpringDataWebSupport`, changing a serialization mode, renaming a field) causes existing tests to fail, fix the tests in the same PR — never leave known failures in the suite. `./mvnw verify` must exit with `BUILD SUCCESS` and `Failures: 0, Errors: 0`.

---

## Coding Conventions

### Backend (Java)

- **Formatting**: Spotless (Eclipse formatter — see `backend/pom.xml`). Run `./mvnw spotless:apply` before committing.
- **Layering**: Controller → Service → Repository. Never skip layers.
- **DTOs**: Always use DTOs at the controller boundary. Never expose entities directly.
- **Caching**: Use `@Cacheable` / `@CacheEvict` from Spring Cache. Redis is the production store.
- **Events**: Use Spring `ApplicationEventPublisher` for cross-cutting side effects. **A listener that reads an entity the publisher just created/updated MUST use `@TransactionalEventListener(phase = AFTER_COMMIT)` + `@Transactional(propagation = REQUIRES_NEW)`, never a plain `@EventListener`.** Publishers fire events *inside* their `@Transactional` method, so an `@Async @EventListener` runs before the row commits and its `findById` returns empty — the work is silently skipped (see the wiki-page-not-ingested bug). AFTER_COMMIT guarantees the row is visible; because there is no transaction to join after commit, the listener must open its own (`REQUIRES_NEW`) — a plain `@Transactional` fails at startup. Reference: `WikiKnowledgeListener` and `ScopeProgressListener`.
- **Soft delete**: Use logical deletion (`deletedAt` timestamp). Never hard-delete user data.
- **Auditing**: Hibernate Envers is enabled. Entity changes are versioned automatically.
- **LLM calls**: Route through the pluggable LLM provider system in `service/llm/`. Never call HTTP directly.
- **Vector stores**: Route through `service/vectorstore/`. Supports Qdrant, ChromaDB, In-Memory.

### Frontend (TypeScript / React)

- **State**: React Query for server state, React Context for global UI state.
- **Forms**: React Hook Form + Zod validation.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4 utility classes.
- **Components**: Radix UI primitives. Keep components in `components/`, pages in `pages/`.
- **i18n**: All user-facing strings go through `i18next`. Add keys to `src/i18n/`.
- **API calls**: Use the typed service files in `services/`. Never use `fetch` directly in components.

---

## RBAC — Roles at a Glance

| Role | Capabilities |
|------|-------------|
| `ADMIN` | Full system access |
| `PROJECT_MANAGER` | Manage projects, cycles, betting |
| `DEVELOPER` | Create/update tasks and scopes |
| `QA` | Manage test cases and bug reports |
| `PRODUCT` | Manage pitches and roadmap |
| `VIEWER` | Read-only |

See `PERMISSION_MATRIX.md` for the full matrix.

---

## Database Migrations

- Managed by **Flyway**. Files live in `backend/src/main/resources/db/migration/`.
- Naming conventions (do **not** rename existing files):
  - **Preferred for new migrations**: `V{YYYY}_{MM}_{DD}_{sequence}__{description}.sql`
    e.g. `V2026_03_24_0001__add_mcp_api_key_scope.sql`
  - **Legacy sequential** (existing files): `V{N}__{description}.sql`
    e.g. `V1__init.sql`, `V99__add_index.sql`
  - **Date-based without underscores** (older files): `V{YYYYMMDD}{seq}__{description}.sql`
- **Never edit an existing migration.** Always add a new file.
- **Use the date-prefixed format for new migrations — NOT bare sequential `V{N}`.** Flyway parses the version numerically, so a sequential `V110` sorts to `110`, which is *lower* than every date-prefixed `V2026_*` migration (e.g. `V2026_03_30_0001` that creates `task_attachments`). On a **fresh** database Flyway applies in version order, so a `V110` that alters a table created by a later-sorting `V2026_*` migration fails. `spring.flyway.out-of-order=true` rescues already-migrated DBs but **not** fresh installs. The legacy `V{N}__` files exist for history only.
- **Tests don't run Flyway** (H2 schema is generated from entities via create-drop), so a broken migration *order* or PostgreSQL-only DDL passes `./mvnw verify` and only fails at real startup — verify new migrations against PostgreSQL.
- H2 is used for tests; PostgreSQL for dev/prod.

---

## MCP Integration (Current State)

ShipFlow currently acts as an **MCP client**, consuming:

- **GitHub MCP** (`service/mcp/GitHubMcpProvider.java`) — reads repo files for Wise Architecture AI feature.
- **Figma MCP** (`service/mcp/FigmaMcpProvider.java`) — reads design context for AI advice.

Config class: `service/mcp/McpConfig.java`
DB settings: `V2026_02_15_0001__add_mcp_organization_settings.sql`

**v0.7.0**: ShipFlow now also acts as an **MCP server** (opt-in via `MCP_SERVER_ENABLED=true`).
External AI tools (Claude Code, Cursor, Claude Desktop) can query and mutate ShipFlow data.
See `MCP_CLIENT_SETUP.md` for client configuration.

---

## AI Features Map

| Feature | Entry Point | Notes |
|---------|------------|-------|
| Wise Architecture | `WiseArchitectureService` | Multi-source context (code + design + roadmap) |
| Risk Analysis | `RiskAnalysisService` | Per-pitch AI risk scoring |
| QA Test Generation | `AITestGenerationService` | Generates test cases from pitches |
| RAG Q&A | `DocumentQAService` | Vector search + LLM answer |
| AI Cache | `AICacheController` | Redis-backed response cache |
| Knowledge Center | `KnowledgeSourceService` + `service/knowledge/source/provider/*` | Pluggable provider SPI; ingested chunks feed Q&A, Wise Architecture, test gen, and risk analysis |

---

## CI / CD

GitHub Actions pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`):

1. Spotless format check
2. Backend tests (`./mvnw verify`)
3. Frontend tests (`npm test`)

PRs to `main` (via `develop`) must pass all checks. Branch naming follows `CONTRIBUTING.md`:
`feature/*`, `fix/*`, `docs/*` — use `develop` as the integration branch.

---

## Common Tasks for Claude Code

### Add a new REST endpoint

1. Create/update DTO in `dto/<feature>/`
2. Add method to the relevant `*Service`
3. Add method to the relevant `*Controller` with `@PreAuthorize`
4. Add Flyway migration if schema changed
5. Write a service test in `src/test/`
6. Run `./mvnw spotless:apply && ./mvnw verify`

### Add a new MCP tool (server-side)

The MCP server is live as of v0.7.0. To add a new tool:

1. Add the tool method to the relevant `*McpTools` class in `service/mcp/server/tools/`
2. Register it in `McpToolDispatcher` — add to `READ_TOOLS` or `WRITE_TOOLS` map and add a static definition method
3. Map to the existing service layer — **never bypass it**
4. If it is a write tool, ensure `properties.isWriteEnabled()` is checked before dispatching
5. Add unit tests in `McpToolDispatcherTest` (no Spring context needed)
6. Update `MCP_CLIENT_SETUP.md` tool reference table

### Add a new Knowledge Center provider

The Knowledge Center exposes a `KnowledgeSourceProvider` SPI in `service/knowledge/source/provider/` so a new ingestion source (Confluence, Notion, Google Drive, etc.) is a single Spring bean:

1. Create `service/knowledge/source/provider/MyProvider.java` implementing `KnowledgeSourceProvider`.
2. Set `getType() = KnowledgeProviderType.MY_TYPE` — add the enum value if it doesn't exist yet.
3. Implement `validateConfig(JsonNode)` (throws on bad input) and `ingest(KnowledgeSource, IngestionContext)` returning an `IngestionResult` of `RawChunk`s.
4. Override `supportsRefresh()` if the source can be re-fetched on a schedule (URL-like sources usually yes; one-shot uploads no).
5. No other wiring needed — Spring auto-registers it via `KnowledgeSourceRegistry`. Add a `frontend/src/i18n/.../provider.MY_TYPE` label in `en.json` + `fa.json` so the UI renders the provider name.

### Add a new object-storage provider

Object storage uses the same provider-SPI shape as the Knowledge Center. The `ObjectStorageProvider` SPI lives in `service/storage/` so a new backend (Azure Blob, GCS, etc.) is a single Spring bean. **No controller or service may call a storage SDK directly — everything routes through `ObjectStorageService`** (same discipline as the LLM/vector-store abstractions).

1. Add the enum value in `service/storage/StorageProviderType.java`.
2. Create `service/storage/provider/MyProvider.java` implementing `ObjectStorageProvider` (`getType()`, `validateConfig(JsonNode)`, `store/retrieve/delete`, optional `testConnection`/`presignUrl`). S3-compatible backends can extend the shared AWS-SDK base provider.
3. Reuse `StorageKeyGenerator` for object keys — never inline key logic.
4. No other wiring — Spring auto-registers it via `ObjectStorageRegistry`. Add a `provider.MY_TYPE` i18n label and surface it in the Storage tab of Org Settings.
5. Connection secrets follow the existing integration-secret convention (see the Architectural Decisions Log): stored write-only (never returned in a DTO, never logged); a future `AttributeConverter` can encrypt the isolated secret columns without a schema change.

### Debug an AI feature

- Check `application-dev.properties` for active LLM provider
- Ollama logs: `ollama logs`
- Redis cache: `redis-cli monitor`
- Vector store: check `VectorStoreConfig` for active profile

### On every feature release (checklist for Claude Code)

This project is **open source** — every significant feature must be documented and visible to contributors and self-hosters. Run this checklist before merging any non-trivial feature PR:

| # | Task | Where |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | Add entry under `[Unreleased]` or bump version | `CHANGELOG.md` |
| 2 | Add feature to the `✨ Features` list — refresh screenshots if UI changed | `README.md` |
| 3 | Add row to the comparison table if it differentiates vs competitors | `README.md` → `🔀 How ShipFlow Compares` |
| 4 | Add highlight card to the in-app release notes page | `frontend/src/pages/ReleaseNotes.tsx` |
| 5 | Update competitor positioning if relevant | `COMPETITOR_ANALYSIS.md` |
| 6 | Update `CLAUDE.md` if the feature introduces a new repeatable task pattern | `CLAUDE.md` |
| 7 | Add / update guide doc if users need setup instructions | relevant `*_GUIDE.md` or `MCP_CLIENT_SETUP.md` |
| 7a | **Add in-app help guide** for every new user-facing feature — `{NN}-{feature}.md` in `backend/src/main/resources/knowledgebase/help-guides/`. Auto-loaded by `HelpGuideAIService`. **A feature without a help guide is incomplete.** | `knowledgebase/help-guides/` |

## Architectural Decisions Log

Key product/architecture decisions recorded here so future Claude Code sessions don't re-debate them.

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2026-04-05 | Competitor migration tools ship in **v1.2.0**, after Scrum mode (v1.1.0) | 90% of Jira/Linear users work in Sprints. Without Scrum mode, imported sprint history would be dropped or wrongly mapped to Shape Up cycles. Once v1.1 ships, the mapping is clean: Sprint→Sprint, Epic→Pitch, Issue→Task. Migration sequence: CSV import → Linear API → Jira API. Always import into Kanban project by default; teams adopt Shape Up/Scrum at their own pace. |
| 2026-06-05 | v1.4.0 merges original v1.4 (Enterprise Auth) + v1.5 (UX Depth) into one milestone | SSO and UX polish are both table-stakes before the AI/automation sprint; combining keeps the release train moving without fragmenting small polish fixes into a separate patch version. |
| 2026-06-18 | v1.8.0 attachments go through a pluggable **object-storage SPI** (`service/storage/`, backends LOCAL_FS/S3/MinIO); LOCAL_FS stays the default so nothing breaks out of the box | Self-hosters need S3/MinIO without code changes. Mirrors the Knowledge Center provider pattern (registry over `List<Provider>`). All attachment I/O routes through `ObjectStorageService`; existing local files keep working and are migrated on backend switch (`StorageMigrationService`, copy-verified before source untouched). |
| 2026-06-18 | Storage connection **credentials stored as plaintext TEXT**, consistent with existing integration secrets (Figma/GitHub/Notion/SMTP), rather than introducing at-rest encryption now | Consistency with the current codebase (no encryption subsystem exists yet) per product decision. Compensating controls: secrets never returned in any DTO (`hasSecretKey` boolean only), never logged. Secret columns are isolated so a future AES-GCM `AttributeConverter` can be dropped in with no schema change. |
| 2026-06-25 | Wiki **revision comparison diffs are computed client-side per BlockNote block** (`frontend/src/components/wiki/wikiDiff.ts`: `blocksToLines` → LCS `diffLines`), NOT from the stored `contentText` | `WikiService.extractText` joins every text node with single spaces, so `contentText` is one space-delimited blob with no block/line boundaries — useless for a readable line diff. The fix: a new read-only `GET /wiki/pages/{id}/revisions/{revision}` returns a single revision's full BlockNote `content` JSON; the frontend extracts one line per block (descending into children) and runs an LCS line diff into side-by-side rows (same/added/removed/changed). Future "compare/diff revisions" work should reuse `wikiDiff.ts`, not diff `contentText`. The compare dialog reuses the `["wiki-page", pageId]` React Query cache for the current version (no extra fetch) and renders highlighted text lines rather than mounting a second BlockNote editor (avoids the cost of two live editors). |
| 2026-06-25 | Wiki page **comments reuse the existing polymorphic comment system** (`CommentEntityType.WIKI_PAGE` on `/api/comments`), not a new wiki-specific table | The `Comment` entity is keyed by `(entityType, entityId)` with no FK, so adding a new commentable surface is purely additive — a new enum value, one `validateEntityExists` case, a notification action-URL case (`/wiki/{spaceId}/{pageId}`), and reusing the `Comments.tsx` component. **Gotcha (fixed in `V2026_06_26_0001`):** the `comments` table has a `CHECK (entity_type IN ('TASK','BUG_REPORT'))` constraint from `V64`, so a new enum value REQUIRES a migration to widen it — H2 tests generate the schema from entities (no CHECK) so they pass while real Postgres rejects the insert with a data-integrity violation. Any future commentable entity must both extend the enum AND add a constraint-widening migration. Note: wiki comments are `isAuthenticated()`-only (matching tasks/bugs), NOT gated by per-space wiki ACL — revisit if private-space comment confidentiality becomes a requirement. |
| 2026-06-26 | **ALL persistent file storage routes through `ObjectStorageService`** (not just wiki/task attachments). `DocumentService` (pitch/meeting/cycle/note docs + bug-report media) and the Knowledge Center `FileUploadProvider` were migrated off direct filesystem writes. Transient/streamed flows (CSV/Zephyr imports, report/data exports, avatars-as-URL) persist no downloadable file, so they stay as-is. | Self-hosters expect every uploaded file in their S3/MinIO bucket. Key points future file-handling code MUST follow: (1) Use `ObjectStorageService.store(...)` (validates 10MB + image/PDF/doc MIME allowlist) for general attachments; use `storeWithoutValidation(...)` ONLY when the caller enforces its own broader policy (e.g. bug media allows video + ~50MB — the façade allowlist would wrongly reject it). (2) Buffer the multipart bytes ONCE (`file.getBytes()`) when both storage AND text-extraction consume the stream. (3) Entities that store files carry `storageProvider` (enum) + `storageKey`, with a legacy read/delete fallback while old rows still have only the pre-SPI path. (4) **Object keys follow a grouped folder convention** — `attachments/{task,bug,wiki}/{id}/…`, `documents/{type}/{id}/…`, `knowledge/{sourceId}/…` — generated by the shared `DocumentService.storageKeyHint(entityType, entityId)` helper; reuse it (and keep `StorageMigrationService` calling the same helper) so upload-time and migration-time keys never drift. (5) Knowledge Center file persistence needs NO schema change: `FileUploadProvider` returns `storageKey`/`storageProvider` in `IngestionResult.sourceMetadata`, which the ingest flow merges into the source's `config` JSON. |
| 2026-06-26 | **Knowledge-Center indexing (embedding generation) MUST run in the background, never inline in an upload/save request.** Fixed: `DocumentService.uploadDocument` called `KnowledgeIngestionService.ingestDocument` synchronously — that method is `@Transactional(REQUIRES_NEW)` but was the one `ingest*` method NOT also `@Async`, so a ~1.5 MB doc blocked the HTTP response ~45 s (a large PDF, minutes). | Embedding generation uses a local CPU ONNX model and scales with content size; doing it on the request thread makes uploads look frozen (the file is already stored, so the object appears in the bucket while nothing returns → users re-upload repeatedly). Fix pattern (reuse it for any new "store + index" flow): the upload method only stores + saves + publishes a domain event (e.g. `DocumentUploadedEvent(id)`); a dedicated listener does the indexing with `@Async @TransactionalEventListener(AFTER_COMMIT) @Transactional(REQUIRES_NEW)` — see `DocumentKnowledgeListener` / `WikiKnowledgeListener`. AFTER_COMMIT guarantees the row is visible; `@Async` keeps embedding off the request thread; the `indexedForQA` flag flips when the listener finishes. Keep cheap, response-shaping work (text extraction, which feeds `textExtracted`/`extractedText`) inline; defer only the slow embedding. Note H2 tests don't exercise this latency, so it only shows up at runtime with a real upload — verify upload responsiveness live, not just via unit tests. |

## Do Not

- Hard-delete user data (use soft delete)
- Bypass `@PreAuthorize` security annotations
- Add `@Transactional` to controller methods
- Call LLM providers directly (use the plugin system)
- Commit `.env` files or secrets
- Skip Spotless (CI will fail)
- Edit existing Flyway migrations
