## Project Overview

Real-time Isolated Sign Language (ISL) recognition system built on the **TSL-ONE-S dataset** (184 Thai Sign Language classes). The project has two phases:

- **Phase 1 (done):** Offline training and evaluation of deep learning models (LSTM, SPOTER) on preprocessed landmark sequences. Best model selected and frozen.
- **Phase 2 (current):** Embed the trained model into a live webcam pipeline that segments, normalizes, and classifies signs in real time.

The core constraint: **normalization at inference must be byte-for-byte identical to training**. Any drift kills accuracy.

**Phase 2 modules to be added (not yet created):**

| Module | Responsibility |
|--------|---------------|
| `pipeline/` | `contracts.py` (shared dataclasses) + `run.py` (the single main loop) |
| `M1/`  | Landmark extraction (MediaPipe), adaptive bounding box, normalization |
| `M3/`  | State machine, frame buffer, trigger logic |
| `M4/`  | Model loading, inference, optimization |
| `M2/`  | Overlay rendering, latency measurement, evaluation |

## Dataset

- **Name:** TSL-ONE-S
- **Classes:** 184 Thai Sign Language glosses (countries, landmarks, numbers 0–10, Thai consonants/vowels, family terms, sports, food)
- **Label map:** `data_preprocess/output_csv/label_map.json` — use `gloss_to_int` and `int_to_gloss` keys
- **Raw data:** hosted externally (Google Drive); not in repo due to size
- **Landmarks:** 75 points per frame extracted via MediaPipe (pose + both hands)

---

## Normalization — Critical Constraint

**Never reimplement normalization.** Always reuse the existing code in `data_preprocess/normalized_csv/`.

### Body Normalization (`body_normalization.py`)

- **Algorithm:** Bohacek-normalization
- **12 body landmarks:** `nose, neck, rightEye, leftEye, rightEar, leftEar, rightShoulder, leftShoulder, rightElbow, leftElbow, rightWrist, leftWrist`
- **Head metric:** shoulder distance (when both shoulders visible) OR neck–nose distance (fallback)
- **Bounding box:** centered on neck, spans ±3× head_metric horizontally, 6× head_metric vertically
- **Fallback:** if no anchor landmarks in a frame, carries forward `last_starting_point`

**For real-time use:** call `normalize_single_dict(row: dict)` where `row` maps landmark names (e.g. `"leftShoulder"`) to a list of `[x, y, ...]` per frame.

### Hand Normalization (`hand_normalization.py`)

- **21 hand landmarks per hand:** wrist + 4 fingers × 4 joints + thumb × 4 joints
- **Column naming convention (CSV):** `{landmark}_{0|1}_{X|Y}` where 0=left, 1=right (converted from `_left_`/`_right_` prefixes on load)
- **Bounding box:** tight box around all non-zero landmarks with 10% padding; square-padded so aspect ratio is 1:1
- **Skips frames** where all landmark values are zero (no hand detected)

**For real-time use:** call `normalize_single_dict(row: dict)` where `row` maps e.g. `"wrist_0"` to a list of `[x, y]` per frame.

---

## Real-Time Pipeline (Phase 2)

### Architecture decision — direct calls, single-threaded

The pipeline runs as **one synchronous loop in `pipeline/run.py`**. M1, M3, M4, and M2 are plain objects whose methods the loop calls in order, passing the dataclasses defined in `pipeline/contracts.py` (see `implementation_plan/m2_plan.md` §2) as arguments and return values. **No queue, no event bus, no worker threads.**

Rationale: this is a one-time-use, single-webcam, single-user demo. The only parallelism a queue would buy is overlapping inference with frame capture, but inference is event-driven (fires once per sign, target < 100 ms) and the user pauses naturally between signs. The cost of threading (shutdown coordination, race conditions, harder debugging) outweighs the benefit. The accepted trade-off is that 2–3 frames are dropped during each inference call at sign-end — acceptable because the user is between signs at that point.

### End-to-End Flow

```python
# pipeline/run.py — canonical wiring
while running:
    raw_frame, capture_ts = m1.grab()
    packet         = m1.extract(raw_frame, capture_ts)   # FramePacket (incl. normalization)
    state_update   = m3.update(packet)                   # StateUpdate (state machine + buffer fill)

    prediction = None
    if state_update.triggered:                           # Active→Idle transition this frame
        buffer     = m3.take_buffer()                    # the 64-frame buffer
        prediction = m4.infer(state_update.sign_event, buffer)  # blocks ~100 ms

    m2.render(packet, state_update, prediction)          # overlay (must be < 5 ms)
    m2.log(packet, state_update, prediction)             # CSV append + metrics (< 5 ms)
```

Conceptual data flow per frame:

```
Webcam frame
  → [M1] MediaPipe landmark extraction (75 points) + adaptive body bbox
  → [M1] SPOTER normalization (body_normalization + hand_normalization, reused exactly)
  → [M3] Hand motion score → classify frame: Idle / Active
  → [M3] State machine: Idle→Active after TA active frames; Active→Idle after TR idle frames
  → [M3] 64-frame sliding buffer fills only while Active
  → [M3] On Active→Idle: emit SignEvent + buffer; main loop forwards to M4
  → [M4] Model inference → class probabilities → top-3 (event-driven, ~100 ms)
  → [M2] Overlay (bbox, state, top-3 + confidence, FPS) + latency log
```

### State Machine Parameters

| Parameter | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| `TA` | Consecutive active frames required to start recording |
| `TR` | Consecutive idle frames required to trigger inference |

These are tunable hyperparameters — default values TBD from calibration.

### Buffer

- Fixed length: **64 frames**
- Fills only while state == Active
- Finalized (sent to inference) when Active→Idle transition fires

## Performance Targets

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| End-to-end latency | < 500 ms |
| Inference latency | < 100 ms |
| Real-time factor (RTF) | < 1.0 |
| Live accuracy | Comparable to Phase 1 offline accuracy |

---

## Models

- **SPOTER** — transformer-based skeleton pose recognizer (primary)
- **LSTM** — sequence model (baseline / fallback)
- Model selection frozen at end of Phase 1. Do not retrain in Phase 2.
- Load from checkpoint; inference only.

---

## Development Rules

1. **Do not touch normalization logic.** If a bug is found in `body_normalization.py` or `hand_normalization.py`, fix it in the existing file — do not create a parallel version. Any change must be validated against offline accuracy first.

2. **Reuse `normalize_single_dict`** (not `normalize_*_full`) for real-time inference. The `*_full` variants operate on full DataFrames and are for batch preprocessing only.

3. **Label map is the source of truth.** Always load `output_csv/label_map.json` for class index↔gloss mappings. Do not hardcode class names.

4. **Latency must be measured explicitly.** M2 is responsible for end-to-end timing. Log per-inference latency to verify RTF < 1.0 in live conditions.

5. **Inference is event-driven, not frame-wise.** The model runs once per detected sign, not once per frame. Do not add per-frame prediction.

6. **Module boundaries are real.** M1/M2/M3/M4 are separate concerns. Keep state machine logic in M3, not scattered across M1 or M4.

7. **Direct calls only — no queues or threads.** The pipeline is a single synchronous loop. Modules communicate via function arguments and return values typed by the dataclasses in `pipeline/contracts.py`. Do not introduce `queue.Queue`, `threading.Thread`, `asyncio`, or any event-bus abstraction. If a future need genuinely requires parallelism, profile first and revisit this decision in the plan rather than silently adding it.

8. **Render and log calls must stay under 5 ms.** Heavy analysis (confusion matrices, F1 deltas, report generation) runs offline after the live session — never inside the main loop.

## Architecture Decisions Log

| # | Decision | Rationale | Date |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Single-threaded direct-call pipeline; no queue / event bus | One-time-use demo; queue complexity (threads, races, shutdown) outweighs the parallelism gain. Inference is event-driven and the user pauses between signs, so 2–3 dropped frames at sign-end is acceptable. | 2026-05-06 |
