# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a template repository for creating custom Claude Code skills. It provides a structured framework for building skills that extend Claude Code's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations.

## Core Architecture

### Skill Structure

Claude Code skills follow a progressive disclosure pattern with three resource types:

1. **SKILL.md** (Required) - Main skill configuration with YAML frontmatter
   - Contains `name` and `description` fields that determine when Claude activates the skill
   - Uses imperative/infinitive form (verb-first instructions) throughout
   - Kept lean (<5k words), detailed info moved to references/

2. **scripts/** - Executable code for deterministic, reusable operations
   - Used when the same code is repeatedly rewritten
   - Can be executed without loading into context

3. **references/** - Documentation loaded into context as needed
   - For schemas, API docs, domain knowledge, policies
   - Keeps SKILL.md focused while providing detailed information

4. **assets/** - Files used in output (NOT loaded into context)
   - Templates, images, boilerplate, fonts
   - Copied/modified in the final output

### GitHub Actions Workflow

The repository includes `.github/workflows/release-skill.yml` which automatically:

- Extracts version from VERSION file
- Validates SKILL.md structure (frontmatter with name/description)
- Builds skill distribution ZIP
- Attaches to GitHub releases

## Development Commands

### Testing the Skill Locally

Install skill to Claude Code skills directory:

```bash
# Windows (Git Bash)
cp -r . "$USERPROFILE/.claude/skills/your-skill-name"

# Unix/Mac
cp -r . ~/.claude/skills/your-skill-name
```

Test activation by asking Claude questions that match the skill description.

### Markdown Linting

The repository uses markdownlint-cli2 with line length checks disabled:

```bash
# Configuration in .markdownlint-cli2.jsonc
# MD013 (line length) is disabled to prevent linter warnings on long lines
```

### Git Configuration

For new repositories, configure git user locally:

```bash
git config --local user.name "your-username"
git config --local user.email "your-email@users.noreply.github.com"
```

### Release Process

1. Update VERSION file with new version (e.g., `1.0.0`)
2. Commit and push: `git commit -m "Release v1.0.0" && git push`
3. Create release: `gh release create v1.0.0 --generate-notes`
4. GitHub Actions automatically builds and attaches skill ZIP

See `docs/tasks/release/how-to-release.md` for detailed instructions.

## Important Files

- **SKILL.md** - Main skill file with YAML frontmatter (name, description)
- **VERSION** - Single version number for releases (e.g., `0.0.1`)
- **README.md** - User-facing documentation and installation instructions
- **SETUP.md** - Step-by-step setup guide for customizing the template
- **.markdownlint-cli2.jsonc** - Markdown linter config (MD013 disabled)
- **docs/tasks/release/how-to-release.md** - Release workflow documentation
- **docs/tasks/tests/how-to-test-skill.md** - Testing framework and test cases

## Skill Development Best Practices

### SKILL.md Description Field

The description field determines when Claude activates the skill. Make it:

- Specific about trigger words users might say
- Clear about scenarios when to use the skill
- Include file types, actions, or topics relevant to the skill
- Use third-person form: "This skill should be used when..."

Example:

```yaml
---
name: docker-helper
description: This skill should be used when the user asks about Docker containers, needs to run docker commands, or wants to manage Docker images and containers. Use when queries mention docker, containerization, or container management.
---
```

### Writing Style

- Use imperative/infinitive form (verb-first instructions) throughout SKILL.md
  - Good: "Run the script to process files"
  - Bad: "You should run the script" or "You can run the script"
- Keep SKILL.md focused and concise (<5k words)
- Move detailed documentation to `references/` files
- Provide real examples, not hypothetical ones

### Bundled Resources Guidelines

#### When to include scripts/

- Code is repeatedly rewritten by Claude
- Deterministic behavior is critical
- Complex logic that shouldn't be regenerated

#### When to include references/

- Detailed schemas, API docs, policies
- Domain-specific knowledge
- Information that informs Claude's process
- For files >10k words, include grep patterns in SKILL.md

#### When to include assets/

- Templates, images, boilerplate
- Files that will be copied/modified in output
- NOT loaded into context, used in final deliverables

### Testing Approach

Follow the framework in `docs/tasks/tests/how-to-test-skill.md`:

1. Install skill locally
2. Test activation with various phrasings
3. Verify core functionality
4. Test error handling
5. Validate documentation accuracy

Create specific test cases for each skill feature with expected inputs/outputs.

## Common Workflows

### Creating a New Skill from Template

1. Update SKILL.md frontmatter (name and description)
2. Customize SKILL.md content (purpose, usage, prerequisites)
3. Add implementation (scripts, references, or assets)
4. Update README.md with skill-specific information
5. Update VERSION file (start with `0.0.1`)
6. Test locally by installing to Claude skills directory
7. Initialize git and push to GitHub
8. Create release when ready

See `SETUP.md` for complete step-by-step instructions.

### Validation Before Release

Required checks:

- SKILL.md has valid YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description`
- VERSION file exists with semantic version number
- README.md is customized (no template placeholders)
- Skill installs correctly to `~/.claude/skills/`
- Claude activates skill when expected
- All documented commands/scripts work
- Documentation matches actual behavior

## Troubleshooting

### Skill Doesn't Activate

1. Verify SKILL.md has valid YAML frontmatter: `head -10 SKILL.md`
2. Check description is specific with trigger words
3. Try explicit request: "Use the [skill-name] skill to..."
4. Restart Claude Code (skills loaded on startup)

### GitHub Actions Release Fails

Common issues:

- VERSION file missing or empty
- SKILL.md missing YAML frontmatter
- Invalid frontmatter (missing `name` or `description`)

Check workflow logs: `gh run view --log`

### Scripts Don't Execute

1. Verify scripts are executable: `chmod +x scripts/*.py`
2. Check required tools installed: `which python`, `which jq`, etc.
3. Test script manually: `python scripts/example_script.py`

## Documentation Structure

```text
docs/
├── guides/              # Additional documentation (optional)
│   └── README.md
└── tasks/
    ├── release/
    │   └── how-to-release.md    # Release workflow
    └── tests/
        └── how-to-test-skill.md # Testing framework
```

## Version Numbering

Follow semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH):

- `0.0.1` - Initial development
- `0.1.0` - First feature complete
- `1.0.0` - First stable release
- `1.1.0` - New feature (backward compatible)
- `1.1.1` - Bug fix
- `2.0.0` - Breaking change
