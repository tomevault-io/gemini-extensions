# Cursor Rules for Zigbee2MQTT Exporter

## Commit Message Guidelines

This project uses [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) for automated releases. Follow these commit message conventions to ensure proper versioning and changelog generation.

### Commit Message Format

Use conventional commit format with the following structure:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Types

- **feat**: A new feature (triggers minor version bump)
- **fix**: A bug fix (triggers patch version bump)
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, etc)
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **perf**: A code change that improves performance
- **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
- **ci**: Changes to CI configuration files and scripts
- **chore**: Other changes that don't modify src or test files
- **revert**: Reverts a previous commit

### Scopes (Optional)

Use scopes to indicate which part of the codebase is affected:

- **config**: Configuration changes
- **metrics**: Metrics collection or export changes
- **websocket**: WebSocket connection or message handling changes
- **collectors**: Data collection changes
- **server**: HTTP server changes
- **logging**: Logging system changes
- **docker**: Docker-related changes
- **docs**: Documentation changes
- **ci**: CI/CD changes
- **zigbee**: Zigbee device handling changes
- **mqtt**: MQTT integration changes

### Examples

✅ **Good commit messages:**

```
feat(metrics): add device type classification metrics

feat: add support for custom device type labels

fix(websocket): handle connection timeouts gracefully

fix: resolve memory leak in device collection

docs: update configuration examples in README

refactor(server): improve HTTP handler error handling

perf: optimize device data processing algorithm

test: add unit tests for WebSocket connection handling

build: update Go version to 1.24

ci: add automated security scanning

chore: update dependencies to latest versions
```

❌ **Bad commit messages:**

```
update code
fix stuff
add feature
bug fix
```

❌ **Bad commit practices:**

- Committing multiple unrelated changes together
- Large commits that are hard to review
- Not reviewing changes before committing
- Committing without understanding what changed

### Breaking Changes

For breaking changes, add `!` after the type/scope and include `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the footer:

```
feat!: remove deprecated config option

BREAKING CHANGE: The `old_config_option` has been removed. Use `new_config_option` instead.
```

### Commit Message Best Practices

1. **Use imperative mood**: "add" not "added" or "adds"
2. **Don't capitalize the first letter**: "add feature" not "Add feature"
3. **No period at the end**: "add feature" not "add feature."
4. **Keep it under 72 characters** for the first line
5. **Be specific and descriptive**
6. **Reference issues when relevant**: "fix: resolve memory leak (#123)"
7. **Inspect before committing**: Always review `git diff --staged` before committing
8. **Keep commits focused**: One logical change per commit
9. **Prefer smaller commits**: Easier to review, revert, and understand

### Release-Please Integration

- **feat** commits trigger minor version bumps
- **fix** commits trigger patch version bumps
- **BREAKING CHANGE** commits trigger major version bumps
- **docs**, **style**, **refactor**, **perf**, **test**, **build**, **ci**, **chore** don't trigger version bumps

### Development Workflow

**Always follow this workflow when making changes:**

1. ✅ **Make your changes**
2. ✅ **Run tests**: `make test` - Ensure all tests pass
3. ✅ **Run linting**: `make lint` - Fix any linting issues
4. ✅ **Format code**: `make fmt` - Ensure consistent formatting
5. ✅ **Verify changes work** - Test your changes manually if needed
6. ✅ **Inspect your changes**: Review what you're about to commit
7. ✅ **Choose appropriate commit message**: Use conventional commit format
8. ✅ **Commit when it works**: Only commit working, tested code
9. ✅ **Push immediately**: `git push` - Don't let changes sit locally

### Development Workflow

**Always follow this workflow when making changes:**

1. ✅ **Check git status**: `git status` - Ensure you're up to date and on the right branch
2. ✅ **Make your changes**
3. ✅ **Run tests**: `make test` - Ensure all tests pass
4. ✅ **Run linting**: `make lint` - Fix any linting issues
5. ✅ **Format code**: `make fmt` - Ensure consistent formatting
6. ✅ **Verify changes work** - Test your changes manually if needed
7. ✅ **Inspect your changes**: Review what you're about to commit
8. ✅ **Choose appropriate commit message**: Use conventional commit format
9. ✅ **Commit when it works**: Only commit working, tested code
10. ✅ **Push immediately**: `git push` - Don't let changes sit locally

### Git Status Check

**Always check git status before starting work:**

```bash
git status
```

**What to look for:**
- ✅ **Clean working directory**: No uncommitted changes
- ✅ **Up to date**: Your branch is not behind origin
- ✅ **Correct branch**: You're on the intended branch (usually `main`)
- ✅ **No conflicts**: No merge conflicts or rebase in progress

**If you see issues:**
- **Uncommitted changes**: Commit or stash them first
- **Behind origin**: `git pull --rebase` to get latest changes
- **Wrong branch**: `git checkout main` or appropriate branch
- **Conflicts**: Resolve them before proceeding

**Why this matters:**
- Prevents working on outdated code
- Avoids merge conflicts later
- Ensures clean, focused commits
- Maintains good git hygiene

### Pre-commit Checklist

Before committing, ensure:

1. ✅ Tests pass: `make test`
2. ✅ Code is formatted: `make fmt`
3. ✅ **Linting passes: `make lint`** - **CRITICAL: Never commit with linting errors**
4. ✅ **Inspect changes**: Review what you're committing with `git diff --staged`
5. ✅ **Choose appropriate message**: Use conventional commit format
6. ✅ **Keep commits focused**: Avoid multiple unrelated changes in one commit
7. ✅ **Prefer smaller commits**: Break large changes into logical, focused commits
8. ✅ Documentation is updated if needed
9. ✅ Changes are verified and working

### Linting Requirements

**ALWAYS fix linting issues before committing:**
- Run `make lint` and address ALL issues
- If linting fails, fix the issues before committing
- Never commit code that fails linting checks
- Use `make fmt` to fix formatting issues automatically
- For complex linting issues, consider disabling specific linters in `.golangci.yml` if they're too strict
- The goal is to maintain clean, consistent code quality

### Post-commit Workflow

After committing, always:

1. ✅ Push changes to remote: `git push`
2. ✅ Verify CI checks pass
3. ✅ Create/update PR if working on a feature branch

### Branch Naming

Use descriptive branch names:

```
feat/add-device-type-classification
fix/websocket-reconnection-handling
docs/update-configuration-examples
refactor/improve-device-data-processing
```

### Dependency Management

**Always use pinned versions instead of "latest" for better Renovate integration:**

✅ **Good version specifications:**
- `go install github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/cmd/golangci-lint@v2.0.0`
- `FROM golang:1.24-alpine`
- `RUN go install github.com/example/tool@v1.2.3`

❌ **Avoid "latest" tags:**
- `go install github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/cmd/golangci-lint@latest`
- `FROM golang:latest`
- `RUN go install github.com/example/tool@latest`

**Benefits of pinned versions:**
- Renovate can detect and update them automatically
- Reproducible builds
- Better security (known versions)
- Easier debugging and rollbacks

### Pull Request Guidelines

- Use conventional commit format for PR titles
- Include detailed description of changes
- Reference related issues
- Ensure CI checks pass
- Request reviews from maintainers

### Automated Release Process

1. Push commits to `main` branch
2. Release-please analyzes commit messages
3. Creates/updates release PR automatically
4. Merging release PR creates new GitHub release
5. Changelog is automatically generated

### Zigbee2MQTT-Specific Guidelines

- **Security**: Never commit Zigbee2MQTT credentials or WebSocket URLs
- **Configuration**: Use environment variables for all configuration
- **Testing**: Test WebSocket connections with local Zigbee2MQTT instances when possible
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling for network issues and device disconnections
- **Metrics**: Ensure all device-related metrics are properly labeled with device information
- **Device Types**: Maintain proper device type classification (Router, EndDevice, Coordinator, GreenPower)
- **WebSocket**: Handle connection drops and reconnections gracefully
- **Performance**: Optimize for real-time device monitoring without excessive resource usage

### Device Monitoring Best Practices

- **Device States**: Track device online/offline status accurately
- **Link Quality**: Monitor and alert on poor link quality
- **Battery Devices**: Handle battery-powered devices appropriately (may go offline for extended periods)
- **Router Devices**: Prioritize monitoring of router devices (critical for network connectivity)
- **Data Collection**: Collect device data efficiently without overwhelming the WebSocket connection

Remember: Good commit messages make the project history more readable and enable automated tools like release-please to work effectively!
