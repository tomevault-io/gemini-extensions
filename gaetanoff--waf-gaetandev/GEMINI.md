## core-agent-orchestration

> Agent orchestration protocol for SDD — context injection, spec-first prompting, handoff sequences, and anti-patterns for all AI coding tools


# Agent Orchestration (Spec-Driven)

> Never ask an AI to "build a feature" without its specification. AI agents will immediately write code when asked. Your job is to enforce the SDD protocol before any implementation prompt is issued.

## Supported Environments

| Tool | Context injection | Spec reference |
|---|---|---|
| Cursor | `@specs/api/openapi.yaml` in Composer | `@` file references |
| Claude Code | `@specs/` directory | Direct file paths |
| GitHub Copilot | `#file:specs/api/openapi.yaml` | `#file` references |
| Windsurf | `@specs/` in Cascade | `@` file references |
| OpenCode / generic | Include spec content in system context | Inline or `@` |

## Context Injection Protocol

Before any SDD session, inject the project context into the agent. This prevents the agent from making assumptions about the project.

### Context Injection Template

```
You are working on [Project Name], a [brief description].

Current project state:
- Mode: [Greenfield | Legacy]
- Phase: [Discovery | Specification | Architecture | Implementation | Validation]
- Spec maturity: [L0 | L1 | L2 | L3 | L4]

Active specs (reference these before writing any code):
- @specs/api/*.openapi.yaml       ← API contracts
- @specs/schemas/*.schema.json    ← Data contracts
- @specs/features/*.feature       ← Behavior contracts
- @specs/decisions/               ← Architecture decisions

SDD Rules:
- Do not write implementation code before specs are approved
- If the request is vague, ask the 5 clarification questions
- If a spec gap is found, stop and document it before continuing
- Reference spec IDs in every code comment and test description
- Promote spec status after each phase completes
```

## SDD Prompting Sequences

Break tasks into strictly ordered prompts. **Do not combine phases into a single prompt.**

### Sequence A — New Feature (Greenfield)

```
Step 1: Discovery
─────────────────
"I want to add [feature]. Before writing any spec or code, run the discovery
protocol. Ask the 5 minimum questions (WHO, WHAT, WHEN, WHY WRONG, DONE).
Do not proceed to specification until I answer them."

Step 2: Specification
─────────────────────
"Discovery is complete. Write the specs for [feature]:
1. JSON Schema in specs/schemas/[entity].schema.json (status: draft)
2. OpenAPI paths in specs/api/[domain].openapi.yaml (status: draft)
3. Gherkin scenarios in specs/features/[feature].feature (status: draft)
Use the templates in templates/specs/. Do not write any implementation code."

Step 3: Spec Review
───────────────────
[Human reviews and approves specs — sets status: approved]

Step 4: Conformance Scaffolding
───────────────────────────────
"Specs are approved. Do not write business logic yet.
1. Generate TypeScript types from the approved schemas
2. Scaffold empty route handler and service stubs
3. Write the conformance test (expect it to fail — no logic yet)
Confirm the test fails for the right reason before continuing."

Step 5: Implementation
──────────────────────
"Now implement [feature] strictly against:
- @specs/schemas/[entity].schema.json
- @specs/api/[domain].openapi.yaml (operation: [operationId])
- @specs/features/[feature].feature (scenarios: [list])
Run the conformance test after each layer (data → logic → API).
Do not modify specs unless a gap is found — follow the spec gap protocol."

Step 6: Validation
──────────────────
"Run the full gate check: spec:lint, typecheck, test:conformance, test:behavior.
Report each gate result. If any gate fails, apply the spec-fix workflow."
```

### Sequence B — Bug Fix

```
Step 1: Bug Discovery
─────────────────────
"Bug reported: [description].
1. Find the spec that defines the expected behavior for this scenario
2. If no spec exists, write the spec of the expected behavior first (status: draft)
3. Write a failing test that reproduces the bug
Do not fix the code yet."

Step 2: Spec Verification
─────────────────────────
"Confirm the failing test accurately reflects the spec.
Apply the SDD debugging decision tree:
- Is the spec correct? → fix the code
- Is the spec missing? → write the spec, get it approved, then fix the code
- Is the test wrong? → fix the test to match the spec
Tell me which path applies before writing any fix."

Step 3: Fix
───────────
"[Path confirmed]. Implement the fix so the reproduction test passes.
Do not change the spec unless the spec itself was wrong (in which case get it approved first)."
```

### Sequence C — Legacy Refactor

```
Step 1: Retro-Spec
──────────────────
"Write retro-specs for [module/file] — describe CURRENT behavior as-is.
Do not improve or change behavior. Write:
1. JSON Schema for each entity the module processes
2. OpenAPI entries for each route (if applicable)
3. Gherkin scenarios for the most critical behaviors
Mark all as status: implemented (they describe existing behavior)."

Step 2: Gap Analysis
────────────────────
"Analyze the retro-specs against the desired behavior.
List:
- Behaviors that should change (delta specs needed)
- Behaviors that should stay (retro-specs are final)
- Missing coverage (spec debt)
Do not refactor yet."

Step 3: Delta Specs
────────────────────
"Write delta specs for the changes identified:
- New/modified OpenAPI entries (status: draft)
- Modified schemas (status: draft)
- New Gherkin scenarios for changed behaviors (status: draft)
These are additive. Do not touch the retro-specs."

Step 4: Refactor
────────────────
"Refactor [module] so it:
1. Still passes all retro-spec conformance tests
2. Also passes all delta-spec conformance tests
Commit after every spec-green step. Do not break existing gates."
```

## Prompt Library — Common Scenarios

### Generate Spec From Requirements

```
Given this requirement: "[paste requirements.md extract]"
Write the following specs:
1. JSON Schema for [entity] at specs/schemas/[entity].schema.json
2. OpenAPI operation for [endpoint] (add to specs/api/[domain].openapi.yaml)
3. 3 Gherkin scenarios (happy path + 2 error paths) at specs/features/[feature].feature

Rules:
- All fields must have types, formats, and descriptions
- Response schema must have additionalProperties: false
- Error codes must match the project error envelope
- Status: draft on all files
Stop and wait for my review before proceeding to implementation.
```

### ADR Generation

```
We need to decide between [Option A] and [Option B] for [requirement].
Draft an ADR at specs/decisions/ADR-[NNN]-[title].md.
- Context: explain what the requirement is
- Options: describe each with specific trade-offs against our existing specs
- Reference: @specs/api/openapi.yaml if the decision affects the API contract
Do not make the decision for me. Present the analysis.
```

### Spec Gap Report

```
Review @specs/api/[domain].openapi.yaml against @src/[module]/.
List every gap:
1. Routes in code that have no OpenAPI entry
2. Response fields in code that are not in the spec schema
3. Error codes returned by code that are not in the spec
4. Request validation in code that is not in the spec
Format as a table: [Gap] | [Location in code] | [Missing spec element] | [Priority]
```

### Security Audit Against Spec

```
Audit @src/[module]/ against the security requirements in @specs/api/[domain].openapi.yaml.
Check:
1. All endpoints marked with security schemes in the spec are actually protected in code
2. All endpoints NOT in the spec or without securitySchemes are unreachable from outside
3. Input validation in code matches the request schema constraints in the spec
4. PII fields in @specs/schemas/*.schema.json are not appearing in logs
Report findings as: [PASS | FAIL | WARN] | [Detail] | [Spec reference]
Do not fix anything yet.
```

### Conformance Test Generator

```
Generate conformance tests for @specs/api/[domain].openapi.yaml.
For each operation:
1. One test for the success response (correct status code + schema)
2. One test for the 400 validation error (invalid request body)
3. One test for the 401 unauthorized response (no auth token)
4. One test for the 404 not found response (if applicable)
Tests must use [Vitest/Jest/pytest] and reference the spec operation IDs.
```

## Debugging Decision Tree

When a test fails or a bug is found, explicitly run this tree before writing any fix:

```
Bug reported or test failed
          │
          ▼
Step 1 — Check the spec
   Is this behavior defined in the spec?
   ├── NO → Spec Gap
   │        Stop. Write the spec (status: draft).
   │        Get it reviewed and approved.
   │        Then write the test, then fix the code.
   └── YES ▼

Step 2 — Check the test
   Does the test accurately reflect the spec?
   ├── NO → Test Bug
   │        Fix the test to match the spec.
   └── YES ▼

Step 3 — Check the code
   Does the code match the spec?
   ├── NO → Code Bug
   │        Fix the code to satisfy the spec.
   └── YES → Spec is ambiguous
             Update spec for clarity (requires review).
```

**Prompt to run this tree:**
```
We have a bug: [description]. Apply the SDD debugging decision tree.
First, tell me what spec defines this behavior and what it says.
If the spec is missing or ambiguous, tell me before suggesting any fix.
```

## Agent Handoff Protocol

When switching agents or sessions on a large task, always start with a handoff prompt:

```
Handoff context for continuing SDD work on [Project]:

Current phase: [phase name]
Last completed: [what was done]
Pending: [what remains]

Approved specs in use:
- @specs/api/[domain].openapi.yaml (v[X.Y.Z], status: approved)
- @specs/schemas/[entity].schema.json (v[X.Y.Z], status: approved)
- @specs/features/[feature].feature (status: approved)

Open spec debt:
- SD-[NNN]: [description] (priority: [high/medium/low])

Open assumptions:
- A-[NNN]: [assumption] (status: [confirmed/pending/unknown])

Next action: [precise next step]
```

---

## Agent Anti-Patterns — Interrupt Immediately

Interrupt the agent and reset to SDD protocol when you observe these:

| Anti-Pattern | Signal | Correction |
|---|---|---|
| Jumping to code | Agent writes `src/` files before `specs/` exist | "Stop. Write the spec first." |
| Hallucinated contracts | Agent invents an API endpoint not in the spec | "That endpoint is not in the spec. Reference @specs/api/" |
| Silent spec changes | Agent modifies schema/OpenAPI without explaining | "Explain the spec change. Is it a breaking change? Does it need a version bump?" |
| Wrong status code | Agent returns 200 where spec says 201 | "The spec says 201. Fix the implementation." |
| Extra response fields | Agent adds undocumented fields to response | "Remove fields not in the spec or add them to the spec first." |
| Spec bypass | Agent uses `as any` or casts to avoid type errors | "Fix the spec gap properly. No type casts." |
| Vague progress | Agent says "done" without running gates | "Run the full gate check and report each gate result." |
| All-at-once implementation | Agent implements everything in one shot | "Implement one vertical slice at a time. Show me after each layer." |

---

## Multi-Agent Patterns

For large features, split work across specialized agents:

```
Agent 1 — Spec Writer
  Input: requirements.md + discovery answers
  Output: specs/schemas/, specs/api/, specs/features/ (all status: draft)
  Boundary: does not write implementation code

Agent 2 — Spec Reviewer
  Input: draft specs from Agent 1
  Output: review comments + approved specs (status: approved)
  Boundary: reviews only, no implementation

Agent 3 — Conformance Test Writer
  Input: approved specs
  Output: test/conformance/*.test.ts (all failing — no implementation yet)
  Boundary: writes tests against spec contracts only

Agent 4 — Implementer
  Input: approved specs + failing conformance tests
  Output: implementation code that makes conformance tests pass
  Boundary: cannot change specs — raises a spec gap if needed

Agent 5 — Validator
  Input: implemented code + all specs
  Output: gate check report + spec status promotions
  Boundary: promotes spec status, does not fix code
```
