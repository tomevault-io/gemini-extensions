# Core Discovery — Anti-Vibe Coding Protocol

> Discovery is the zero phase. No spec written, no architecture drawn, no code touched until discovery is complete and signed off.

---

## Anti-Vibe Coding — Mandatory Protocol

**Never start coding from a vague request.** Vibe coding produces code that cannot be tested, maintained, or validated against any contract. It creates technical debt from line 1.

### Trigger Conditions — Stop and Clarify

Stop immediately and initiate discovery when:

- The request uses vague terms: "do something with", "make it better", "add a feature", "fix the issue", "improve performance"
- The domain model is undefined or implicit
- Success criteria are missing or unmeasurable
- The target user or actor is not named
- The request contradicts an existing spec without acknowledging it
- Edge cases are not mentioned for a business-critical flow
- The scope is unbounded ("handle all cases", "support everything")

### Minimum Viable Clarification — The 5 Questions

Ask exactly the questions that unblock spec writing. Never more, never less. Group them in a single message.

```
Before I write the spec and start implementation, I need 5 answers:

1. WHO — What actor/user triggers this? What system receives the result?
2. WHAT — What is the precise expected outcome? (input → transformation → output)
3. WHEN — What conditions/events trigger this flow?
4. WHY WRONG — What does failure look like? What errors must be handled?
5. DONE — What does "done" mean? How do we verify it works?
```

**Do not ask for implementation preferences** ("should I use REST or GraphQL?"). That is architecture, not discovery.

### Discovery Output — Required Artifacts

Discovery is complete only when these 3 artifacts are drafted:

| Artifact | Format | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `specs/mission.md` | Markdown | Problem statement, actors, goals, non-goals |
| `specs/requirements.md` | Markdown + Given-When-Then | Functional + non-functional requirements |
| `specs/decisions/ADR-000-project-context.md` | ADR template | Initial architectural context |

## Structured Discovery Process

### Phase 0.1 — Problem Statement

```markdown
## Problem Statement

**Context**: [Current situation — what exists, what is broken or missing]
**Problem**: [The actual pain point, with evidence if possible]
**Impact**: [Who is affected, how often, what is the cost of inaction]
**Hypothesis**: [The proposed solution direction — not the implementation]
```

### Phase 0.2 — Actor Mapping

Identify every actor (human or system) that interacts with the feature:

```markdown
## Actors

| Actor | Type | Goal | Permissions |
|---|---|---|---|
| End user | Human | Creates and manages resources | Read, Write own |
| Admin | Human | Oversees all resources | Full access |
| Payment gateway | External system | Processes transactions | Webhook push |
| Background job | Internal system | Processes async tasks | Internal |
```

### Phase 0.3 — Constraint Inventory

Collect hard constraints before any design decision:

```markdown
## Constraints

### Technical Constraints
- [ ] Existing system integrations (APIs, databases, auth providers)
- [ ] Performance SLOs (response time, throughput, availability)
- [ ] Deployment environment (cloud provider, region, container runtime)
- [ ] Security requirements (compliance, data residency, encryption)

### Business Constraints
- [ ] Delivery deadline
- [ ] Budget / infrastructure cost ceiling
- [ ] Regulatory requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2, PCI-DSS)
- [ ] Stakeholder sign-off requirements

### Knowledge Constraints
- [ ] Team expertise gaps
- [ ] Missing domain knowledge
- [ ] External dependencies not yet evaluated
```

### Phase 0.4 — Assumption Tracker

Every assumption made during discovery becomes an explicit, tracked decision.

```markdown
## Assumptions → Decisions

| ID | Assumption | Risk if Wrong | Resolution | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A-001 | Users are authenticated via OAuth2 | Auth system incompatibility | Confirmed with auth team | ✅ Confirmed |
| A-002 | p95 latency < 200ms is acceptable | SLA violation | Pending stakeholder review | ⏳ Pending |
| A-003 | Data volume < 1M records/day | Architecture mismatch | Not yet evaluated | ❌ Unknown |
```

**Rule**: Every `❌ Unknown` assumption blocks spec approval. Resolve before proceeding.

## Greenfield vs Legacy Discovery

### Greenfield Project Discovery

Full discovery is required. No existing constraints to preserve.

```
Discovery Checklist — Greenfield
- [ ] Problem statement written and validated
- [ ] All actors identified and mapped
- [ ] Functional requirements listed (happy path)
- [ ] Non-functional requirements listed (performance, security, scale)
- [ ] All constraints inventoried
- [ ] All assumptions tracked
- [ ] MVP scope defined (minimal set of specs that delivers value)
- [ ] Non-goals explicitly listed
- [ ] mission.md written
- [ ] requirements.md drafted
- [ ] ADR-000 written
```

### Legacy Project Discovery

Legacy discovery adds reverse-engineering the existing system before any change.

```
Discovery Checklist — Legacy
- [ ] Existing behavior documented (what does the system currently do?)
- [ ] Existing contracts identified (what APIs, schemas, events exist?)
- [ ] Existing tests inventoried (what is covered? what is not?)
- [ ] Known bugs and limitations catalogued
- [ ] Stakeholders affected by change identified
- [ ] Backward compatibility requirements defined
- [ ] Migration path outlined (data, API, client behavior)
- [ ] Rollback plan defined
- [ ] Problem statement written (delta from current state)
- [ ] requirements.md written (delta + existing)
```

## Feature Addition Discovery

When adding a feature to an existing project:

1. **Read existing specs first** — understand the current contract
2. **Identify spec gaps** — what is not covered by existing specs?
3. **Check for conflicts** — does the new feature contradict an existing contract?
4. **Define the delta** — only document what changes, not the whole system
5. **Write an ADR** if the feature introduces a new architectural pattern

---

## Bug Fix Discovery

A bug is a spec violation. Discovery for a bug fix:

1. **Reproduce the bug** with a failing test or specific input
2. **Identify the broken contract** — which spec or expectation does the bug violate?
3. **If no spec exists** — write the spec of the expected behavior first
4. **Document the reproduction case** in `specs/features/<feature>.feature` as a new scenario
5. **Fix is complete only when** the reproduction scenario passes

```
Bug Discovery Template

## Bug Report

**Observed behavior**: [What the system does]
**Expected behavior**: [What the spec says it should do]
**Reproduction steps**: [Exact sequence of actions]
**Contract violated**: [Link to spec file, line number if possible]
**Scope**: [Is this isolated to one component or does it affect multiple contracts?]
```

## Discovery Anti-Patterns — Never Do These

| Anti-Pattern | Why It's Wrong | Correct Action |
|---|---|---|
| Start coding from a Slack message | No contract, no success criteria | Initiate discovery, write spec |
| Assume requirements from existing code | Code may be wrong; code is not a spec | Read specs, not code |
| Skip discovery for "small" features | Small features break existing contracts | Even 1-line changes need a delta spec |
| Discover and implement in the same session | No review cycle, no validation | Always separate discovery → review → implementation |
| Accept vague acceptance criteria | "Works well" is not a test | Require Given-When-Then for every scenario |
| Design the solution during discovery | Premature architecture | Discovery produces requirements, not designs |

---

## Discovery Gate — Proceed Checklist

Before leaving the discovery phase, verify:

```
Discovery Gate

[ ] Problem statement is crisp, specific, and bounded
[ ] All actors are named and their goals are explicit
[ ] Functional requirements cover happy path + at least 2 error paths
[ ] Non-functional requirements have measurable thresholds
[ ] All assumptions are tracked; no unknowns remain
[ ] Non-goals are explicitly listed
[ ] mission.md exists in specs/
[ ] requirements.md exists in specs/
[ ] At least one ADR exists in specs/decisions/
[ ] No implementation decisions made during discovery
[ ] Stakeholder sign-off obtained (or explicitly waived with reason)
```

**Only after this gate passes does spec writing begin.**
