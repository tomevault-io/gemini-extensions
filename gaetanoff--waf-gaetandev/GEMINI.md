## core-workflow

> Master workflow for Spec Driven Development — specifications are the single source of truth, covering greenfield and legacy modes


# SDD Workflow (Spec Driven Development)

> Specifications are the single source of truth. Code is a consequence of specs, not the other way around. Every phase is gated. No phase starts until the previous one is complete and signed off.

## Project Mode Selection

Before starting, select the correct mode. Rules differ between modes.

### Greenfield Mode

Use when: building from scratch, no existing codebase, no legacy constraints.

```
Greenfield Workflow
─────────────────
Phase 0 → Discovery (full)
Phase 1 → Write all specs from scratch
Phase 2 → Design architecture from specs
Phase 3 → Plan implementation
Phase 4 → Scaffold from specs
Phase 5 → Implement spec by spec
Phase 6 → Validate all gates
Phase 7 → Release v1.0.0
```

### Legacy Mode

Use when: existing codebase, adding features, refactoring, or fixing bugs.

```
Legacy Workflow
──────────────
Phase 0 → Spec Audit (inventory what exists)
          ↓
Phase 0b → Write retro-specs (describe current behavior as-is)
          ↓
Phase 0c → Identify gaps (what is not yet specified)
          ↓
Phase 1 → Write delta specs (what changes)
Phase 2 → Check architecture impact (ADR if breaking)
Phase 3 → Plan migration
Phase 4 → Scaffold migration artifacts (if needed)
Phase 5 → Implement against new specs
Phase 6 → Validate conformance (retro + new specs)
Phase 7 → Release with migration guide
```

---

## Phase 0: Discovery (see `core-discovery` rule)

**Required artifacts:**
- `specs/mission.md` — problem statement, actors, goals, non-goals
- `specs/requirements.md` — functional + non-functional requirements
- `specs/decisions/ADR-000-project-context.md` — initial context

**Gate to pass:** All discovery questions answered. No open unknowns. Stakeholder sign-off.

**Anti-vibe protocol:** Never proceed to specification if:
- The request is vague, unbounded, or missing success criteria
- Actors are not named
- Edge cases are not defined for business-critical flows

---

## Phase 1: Specification (see `core-specification` and `core-spec-lifecycle` rules)

Write formal, machine-readable specs BEFORE any design or code decision.

### Spec Format by Project Type

```
What are you building?
│
├── REST API?
│   ├── OpenAPI 3.1 (mandatory) → specs/api/*.openapi.yaml
│   ├── JSON Schema for entities (mandatory) → specs/schemas/*.schema.json
│   ├── Gherkin for behavior (required for critical paths) → specs/features/*.feature
│   └── Pact for consumer-driven contracts (if external consumers) → specs/contracts/
│
├── GraphQL API?
│   ├── GraphQL SDL (mandatory)
│   ├── JSON Schema for complex inputs/outputs
│   └── Gherkin for behavior
│
├── Event-Driven / Message Queue?
│   ├── AsyncAPI (mandatory) → specs/events/*.asyncapi.yaml
│   └── JSON Schema for event payloads (mandatory)
│
├── Frontend (SPA/SSR)?
│   ├── OpenAPI for all consumed APIs (mandatory)
│   ├── Component prop types (mandatory)
│   └── Storybook stories as UI specs (recommended)
│
├── Mobile App?
│   ├── OpenAPI for consumed APIs (mandatory)
│   └── Screen flow spec (recommended)
│
└── CLI Tool?
    ├── Command spec in Markdown (flags, args, output format) (mandatory)
    └── Gherkin for behavior (recommended)
```

### Spec Rules
- Every spec starts with `status: draft` (see spec lifecycle)
- Specs must be reviewed and set to `status: approved` before implementation
- No `TODO` or `TBD` in an approved spec — replace with a tracked assumption
- All error cases must be specified, not just the happy path
- All specs must include at least one example

---

## Phase 2: Architecture (see `core-architecture` rule)

Design the system from approved specs. Never design before specs exist.

### Architecture Deliverables
- `specs/decisions/ADR-001-*.md` — architecture decisions driven by specs
- C4 model Level 1 (System Context) and Level 2 (Containers) diagrams
- Data model diagram derived from JSON Schema contracts
- Sequence diagrams for critical flows derived from Gherkin scenarios

### Architecture Rules
- Architecture is **derived** from specs, not chosen arbitrarily
- Every significant architectural decision has an ADR
- ADRs reference the specs that drove the decision
- Architecture is reviewed before scaffolding begins

---

## Phase 3: Planning (see `core-planning` rule)

Break down approved specs into implementation tasks.

### Planning Structure
```
Epic (maps to a set of related specs)
  └── Feature (maps to a single spec file or related group)
        └── Task (maps to a vertical slice: spec → test → data → logic → API → UI)
```

### MVP Scoping
- Define MVP as the minimum set of specs at `approved` status that delivers business value
- Non-MVP specs are `draft` or not yet written — they do not block MVP release
- Every task has measurable acceptance criteria from the spec

---

## Phase 4: Scaffolding (see `core-scaffolding` rule)

Generate project structure and tooling aligned with approved specs.

### Scaffolding Checklist
```
[ ] specs/ directory structure created
[ ] Spec linting configured (spectral)
[ ] Conformance testing configured (dredd / prism)
[ ] Code generation configured (openapi-generator / json-schema-to-typescript)
[ ] package.json scripts: spec:lint, spec:test, spec:generate
[ ] Contract stubs generated from specs (TypeScript types, route skeletons, DB schema)
[ ] Pre-commit hooks: spec lint + type check
[ ] .env.example created with all required variables
[ ] SPEC-INDEX.md created
```

---

## Phase 5: Spec-First Implementation (see `core-implementation` rule)

Build feature by feature. **Always in this order:**

```
For each vertical slice:
1. Confirm spec is at status: approved
2. Generate types/interfaces from spec schemas
3. Write conformance test (must fail initially)
4. Implement data layer (migration, model)
5. Implement business logic
6. Implement API/controller layer
7. Run conformance test (must pass)
8. Run all existing tests (must still pass)
9. Promote spec to status: implemented
10. Commit with conventional commit message
```

### Spec Gap Protocol
When implementation reveals something the spec doesn't cover:

```
STOP → document the gap in specs/spec-debt.md
     → update the spec (requires review)
     → if approved → continue implementation
     → if rejected → adjust implementation approach
```

Never work around a spec gap silently. Never assume.

---

## Phase 6: Conformance Gates (see `core-quality-gates` rule)

A feature is **done** only when all gates pass.

### Gate Summary

| Gate | What it Checks | Blocks |
|---|---|---|
| G1 — Spec lint | Spec is valid and complete | Merge |
| G2 — Type check | Generated types compile | Merge |
| G3 — Conformance | API matches OpenAPI exactly | Merge |
| G4 — Behavior | Gherkin scenarios pass | Merge |
| G5 — Security | Auth matches spec, no secrets | Merge |
| G6 — Performance | p95 meets SLO thresholds | Release |
| G7 — PR checklist | Human checklist signed off | Merge |

---

## Phase 7: Iteration & Release (see `core-iteration` and `core-changelog-release` rules)

### When Requirements Change
1. Update the spec (requires review — it changes the contract)
2. Run spec diff to identify breaking vs non-breaking
3. Bump version accordingly (semantic versioning)
4. Update conformance tests
5. Update implementation
6. Update CHANGELOG.md
7. Run all gates
8. Release

### Release Rules
- No release without a passing conformance gate suite
- No breaking change without a MAJOR version bump and migration guide
- Every release updates CHANGELOG.md with spec references
- Deprecated specs follow the sunset protocol

---

## Spec Maturity Model

Track and improve your project's spec coverage:

| Level | Name | Description | Target |
|---|---|---|---|
| L0 | No Specs | Code-first, no formal contracts | Start spec backlog immediately |
| L1 | Partial Specs | Some specs, incomplete coverage | Cover critical paths first |
| L2 | Full Specs | All contracts formally specified | All endpoints, entities, behaviors |
| L3 | Conformance Tested | Specs validated by automated tests in CI | Minimum for production |
| L4 | Spec-Driven Automation | Specs generate types, tests, and docs | Target for long-lived products |

**Production minimum**: L3. **Product target**: L4.

---

## Invariants — Never Violate These

1. No implementation without an `approved` spec
2. No endpoint without an OpenAPI contract
3. No entity without a JSON Schema
4. No critical behavior without a Gherkin scenario
5. No major version bump without a migration guide
6. No PR without a conformance gate check
7. No breaking change without an ADR
8. No vague request → immediately trigger discovery protocol
9. Spec wins when code and spec disagree — fix the code or explicitly update the spec
10. When in doubt, ask. Wrong assumptions compound into wrong implementations.
