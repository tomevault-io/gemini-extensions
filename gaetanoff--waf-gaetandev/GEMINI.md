# Contract-First Architecture

## Decision Framework

For every architectural decision, document as an ADR referencing the specs that drove it:

1. **Context**: What spec requirement or contract constraint drives this decision?
2. **Options**: What are the viable approaches? (minimum 2)
3. **Trade-offs**: Pros and cons of each option against the spec requirements.
4. **Decision**: Which option and why — with spec references.
5. **Consequences**: What contracts are affected? What new specs are needed?

## Architecture Patterns

Choose based on the contracts defined in the Specification phase:

| Pattern | When to Use | Spec Signal |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| **Monolith** | Small team, single product, few API contracts | <10 endpoints, single data store |
| **Modular Monolith** | Growing product, clear contract boundaries | Multiple bounded contexts in specs |
| **Microservices** | Independent contracts, different scaling needs | Separate API specs per domain |
| **Serverless** | Event-driven contracts, async workflows | AsyncAPI specs, event schemas |
| **Jamstack** | Content-heavy, static + dynamic hybrid | Few API contracts, CDN-friendly |
| **Event-Driven** | Async workflows, decoupled contracts | Event schemas, pub/sub contracts |

## C4 Architecture Model

Document architecture at four levels of abstraction, driven by specs:

### Level 1: System Context Diagram

Shows the system and its external actors/dependencies. Derived from integration contracts.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                   SYSTEM CONTEXT                     │
│                                                      │
│  [User] ──→ [Your System] ──→ [Payment Provider]    │
│                  │                                    │
│                  ├──→ [Email Service]                 │
│                  └──→ [Auth Provider]                 │
│                                                      │
│  Sources: specs/contracts/*.pact.json                │
│           specs/api/openapi.yaml (security schemes)  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Rules:
- Every external dependency must have an integration contract.
- Every actor must be referenced in behavior specs.

### Level 2: Container Diagram

Shows the major containers (apps, databases, queues). Derived from API specs and data contracts.

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    CONTAINER DIAGRAM                        │
│                                                             │
│  [Web App (Next.js)] ──API──→ [API Server (Node.js)]       │
│                                     │                       │
│                              ┌──────┼──────┐                │
│                              ↓      ↓      ↓                │
│                          [PostgreSQL] [Redis] [S3]          │
│                                                             │
│  [Mobile App] ──API──→ [API Server]                         │
│                                                             │
│  Sources: specs/api/openapi.yaml (API boundaries)           │
│           specs/schemas/ (data store decisions)              │
│           specs/decisions/ (ADRs)                            │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Level 3: Component Diagram

Shows modules within a container. Derived from feature specs and bounded contexts.

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              API SERVER — COMPONENT DIAGRAM               │
│                                                           │
│  ┌──────────┐  ┌──────────┐  ┌──────────────┐           │
│  │   Auth   │  │  Users   │  │   Orders     │           │
│  │  Module  │  │  Module  │  │   Module     │           │
│  └────┬─────┘  └────┬─────┘  └──────┬───────┘           │
│       │              │               │                    │
│  ┌────┴──────────────┴───────────────┴────┐              │
│  │         Shared Infrastructure           │              │
│  │  (middleware, error handler, logger)     │              │
│  └─────────────────────────────────────────┘              │
│                                                           │
│  Sources: specs/features/ (one module per feature area)   │
│           specs/schemas/ (shared schemas = shared infra)  │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Level 4: Code Diagram

Shows classes/functions within a component. Derived from data contracts and behavior specs. Use sparingly — code should be self-documenting at this level.

## Domain-Driven Design Patterns (Spec-Driven)

For complex domains, use DDD patterns mapped to specs:

### Bounded Contexts

Each bounded context maps to a separate set of specs:

```
specs/
  contexts/
    identity/               # Auth & user management context
      api/openapi.yaml
      schemas/user.schema.json
      features/auth.feature
    ordering/               # Order management context
      api/openapi.yaml
      schemas/order.schema.json
      features/checkout.feature
    shipping/               # Shipping context
      api/openapi.yaml
      schemas/shipment.schema.json
    shared-kernel/          # Shared across contexts
      schemas/address.schema.json
      schemas/money.schema.json
```

Rules:
- Each bounded context owns its specs — no cross-context `$ref` except shared-kernel.
- Context boundaries align with team boundaries (Conway's Law).
- Communication between contexts is via explicit contracts (API, events, shared-kernel).

### Aggregates

Map aggregate roots to data contracts:

- The aggregate root schema is the main entity schema.
- Child entities within the aggregate are nested in the root schema.
- Invariants (business rules) are expressed in behavior specs.
- Each aggregate boundary defines a transaction boundary.

### Domain Events

Map domain events to AsyncAPI specs:

```yaml
channels:
  ordering/order-placed:
    publish:
      message:
        payload:
          type: object
          required: [orderId, userId, items, total, placedAt]
          properties:
            orderId: { type: string, format: uuid }
            userId: { type: string, format: uuid }
            items: { type: array }
            total: { type: number }
            placedAt: { type: string, format: date-time }
```

Rules:
- Every state transition that other contexts care about → domain event.
- Events are immutable facts — define them as past-tense verbs (`OrderPlaced`, `UserRegistered`).
- Include all data the consumer needs — consumers should not call back to the producer.

## API Gateway Patterns

When multiple API specs exist (microservices, bounded contexts):

### Aggregation

```yaml
# Gateway aggregates multiple backend APIs into one consumer-facing API
gateway:
  routes:
    /api/v1/users:
      upstream: identity-service
      spec: specs/contexts/identity/api/openapi.yaml

    /api/v1/orders:
      upstream: ordering-service
      spec: specs/contexts/ordering/api/openapi.yaml

    /api/v1/shipping:
      upstream: shipping-service
      spec: specs/contexts/shipping/api/openapi.yaml
```

### Gateway Responsibilities (from specs)
- **Authentication**: validate JWT per the security scheme in OpenAPI spec.
- **Rate limiting**: enforce limits per the rate limit contract.
- **Request routing**: map paths to upstream services per API specs.
- **Response aggregation**: combine responses from multiple specs (BFF pattern).
- **Protocol translation**: GraphQL → REST, REST → gRPC per contract mappings.

## Contract-Driven Data Modeling

- Start from the **data contracts** (JSON Schema / TypeScript interfaces) defined in specs.
- Map each schema to a database table/collection — the spec IS the source of truth.
- Normalize for writes, denormalize for reads (when performance specs require it).
- Choose the right database for the workload based on contract shapes:
  - **Relational** (PostgreSQL, MySQL): structured schemas, complex query contracts, ACID.
  - **Document** (MongoDB, Firestore): flexible schemas, nested data contracts.
  - **Key-Value** (Redis, DynamoDB): simple lookup contracts, high-throughput.
  - **Graph** (Neo4j): relationship-heavy contracts.
- Plan for data migrations from day one. Schema evolution must maintain contract compatibility.

## Contract-Driven API Design

- API architecture is derived directly from the **OpenAPI / GraphQL / gRPC specs**.
- Every endpoint in the spec maps to a route, controller, and service.
- Shared spec components (`$ref`) map to shared middleware and utilities.
- Error contracts define the error handling middleware.
- Pagination, filtering, and sorting contracts define query parameter handling.
- Versioning strategy is defined in the spec (`/api/v1/`).

## State Management (Driven by Contracts)

- Identify what state lives where based on the data contracts:
  - Server state: entities defined in data schemas.
  - Client state: UI component contracts and prop types.
  - URL state: query parameters defined in API specs.
  - Cache state: derived from response contracts and cache-control specs.
- Minimize client-side state. Derive what you can from server contracts.
- Use optimistic updates for responsive UIs with server contract reconciliation.

## Security Architecture (Driven by Security Specs)

- Authentication strategy defined in the API spec's security schemes.
- Authorization model derived from endpoint-level security requirements in the spec.
- Trust boundaries mapped from the contract boundaries between services.
- Secrets management, encryption specs defined as non-functional requirements.

## Scalability (Driven by Performance Specs)

- Performance SLOs from specs drive scaling decisions (p50/p95/p99 latency, throughput).
- Identify bottlenecks by analyzing contract call patterns and data flow.
- Use stateless services where contracts allow (easier to scale).
- Plan caching layers based on response contract cache-control headers.
- Async processing for contracts with high latency tolerance (queues, background jobs).

## Cross-Cutting Concerns (Defined in Shared Specs)

Plan these upfront as shared spec components:
- **Error envelope**: standard error response contract used by all endpoints.
- **Pagination**: shared pagination contract (`page`, `limit`, `total`, `next`).
- **Logging**: structured log format spec with correlation IDs (see `core-observability` rule).
- **Health checks**: health endpoint contract (`/health`, `/ready`).
- **Rate limiting**: rate limit headers contract (`X-RateLimit-*`).
- **Auth headers**: authentication header contract (`Authorization: Bearer <token>`).
