# Core Changelog & Release Management

> Every release is a set of spec promotions. The changelog documents what contracts changed, not what code changed.

---

## Semantic Versioning — Spec-Driven Rules

Version increments are driven by the **spec changes**, not by line count or effort.

```
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

MAJOR — Breaking contract change (field removed, type changed, endpoint renamed)
MINOR — Additive contract change (new optional field, new endpoint, new event)
PATCH — Non-contract change (bug fix within existing contract, perf, docs)
```

### Version Determination Workflow

```
1. List all spec changes in this release
2. For each changed spec, classify the change (breaking / additive / patch)
3. Apply the highest-severity classification to the release version
4. If any spec is MAJOR → bump MAJOR, reset MINOR and PATCH to 0
5. If highest is MINOR → bump MINOR, reset PATCH to 0
6. If all are PATCH → bump PATCH only
```

### Breaking Change Definition (triggers MAJOR)

A breaking change is any change that **requires existing clients to update**:

- Removing a field from a response schema
- Renaming a field in a request or response
- Changing a field's type (string → number, optional → required)
- Removing or renaming an endpoint
- Changing an HTTP method for an existing endpoint
- Changing authentication scheme
- Removing an enum value that clients may have stored
- Changing event payload structure in AsyncAPI specs

## Changelog Format — Keep a Changelog Standard

Every project maintains a `CHANGELOG.md` at the root with this structure:

```markdown
# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
Format: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/)
Versioning: [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)

## [Unreleased]

```

### Changelog Sections

| Section | Use When |
|---|---|
| `Added` | New endpoints, fields, features, events — additive changes |
| `Changed` | Modified behavior within existing contract |
| `Deprecated` | Fields or endpoints marked for removal — include sunset date |
| `Removed` | Previously deprecated items now removed |
| `Fixed` | Bug fixes that do not change the contract |
| `Security` | Vulnerability fixes, auth changes, CVE patches |

**Always link to the relevant spec** in changelog entries: `(spec: api-user-003)`.

# Never push without a complete changelog and passing CI
```

## Deprecation Protocol

When deprecating a contract (field, endpoint, event):

### Step 1 — Mark in Spec

```yaml
# In OpenAPI spec
/users/search:
  get:
    deprecated: true
    description: |
      DEPRECATED as of v2.1.0. Sunset date: 2025-01-01.
      Use GET /users?q= instead.
      Migration guide: docs/migration/v2.1.0.md
```

### Step 2 — Add Response Header

```http
Deprecation: true
Sunset: Mon, 01 Jan 2025 00:00:00 GMT
Link: <https://api.example.com/docs/migration/v2.1.0>; rel="deprecation"
```

### Step 3 — Changelog Entry

```markdown
### Deprecated
- `GET /users/search` — deprecated in v2.1.0. Use `GET /users?q=` instead.
  Sunset: 2025-01-01. See [migration guide](docs/migration/v2.1.0.md).
```

### Step 4 — Removal (at sunset date)

- Bump MAJOR version
- Remove spec, code, and tests
- Add entry to `### Removed` in CHANGELOG
- Update migration guide with "migration period closed" note

---

## Migration Guide Template

For every MAJOR version bump, create `docs/migration/vX.0.0.md`:

```markdown
# Migration Guide — v[OLD] → v[NEW]

## Summary of Breaking Changes

| Change | Old Behavior | New Behavior | Spec |
|---|---|---|---|
| `user.fullName` removed | String field | Use `user.firstName` + `user.lastName` | schema-user-001 v2.0.0 |
| Auth scheme changed | Basic auth | Bearer JWT | api-auth-001 v2.0.0 |

## Migration Steps

### 1. Update Authentication

Before (v1.x):
```http
Authorization: Basic dXNlcjpwYXNz
```

After (v2.0):
```http
Authorization: Bearer <jwt-token>
```

Obtain JWT tokens from `POST /auth/token`.

### 2. Update User Object Usage

Before:
```json
{ "fullName": "John Doe" }
```

After:
```json
{ "firstName": "John", "lastName": "Doe" }
```

## Timeline

| Date | Milestone |
|---|---|
| 2024-03-20 | v2.0.0 released, v1.x deprecated |
| 2025-01-01 | v1.x sunset — endpoints return 410 Gone |
```

---

## Automated Changelog tooling

Recommended tools aligned with conventional commits:

```bash
# Generate changelog from conventional commits
npx conventional-changelog-cli -p angular -i CHANGELOG.md -s

# Or with git-cliff (Rust-based, config-driven)
git cliff --output CHANGELOG.md

# Check for breaking changes between two versions
npx @openapitools/openapi-diff old-spec.yaml new-spec.yaml
```

**CI integration**: Run OpenAPI diff on every PR that touches `specs/api/`. Block merge if breaking changes are detected without a MAJOR version bump.
