## Project Overview

mineSQL is a Postgres-wire-compatible relational database engine written in Go. Its storage backend is a live Minecraft world — every row is a strip of banner blocks and signs standing on grass, the transaction log is a row of lecterns to the west of spawn, and internal metadata lives underground. It implements real database internals: WAL, MVCC, a query executor, and a SQL parser.

Full technical spec (authoritative): [`docs/spec.md`](./docs/spec.md)

**When in doubt about any decision — build order, wire protocol messages, WAL invariants, row encoding format, plugin protocol opcodes — the spec wins.**

The Paper plugin (Java, separate repo) lives at: `github.com/swapnil404/minesql-hal`

## Build & Run

```bash
# Build
go build ./cmd/minesql

# Run (requires Minecraft server running, see docker-compose.dev.yml)
MINESQL_MINECRAFT_ADDR=localhost:25576 MINESQL_PORT=5455 go run ./cmd/minesql

# Run all tests
go test ./...

# Run tests for a specific package
go test ./internal/storage/...

# Lint
golangci-lint run
```

### Dev Environment

Start Minecraft only (engine runs locally):
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
```

Full stack:
```bash
docker compose up
```

## Code Style

- **Formatter**: `gofmt` — all code must be gofmt clean, no exceptions
- **Linter**: `golangci-lint` — run before any commit
- **Error handling**: always handle errors explicitly, never `_` an error unless there is a clear documented reason
- **No global state**: pass dependencies explicitly, do not use package-level variables for mutable state
- **Interfaces over concrete types**: especially at package boundaries (e.g. `hal.Storage`, not `hal.MinecraftHAL` directly)
- **Context propagation**: all blocking operations (HAL calls, TCP reads) must accept and respect `context.Context`
- **Package naming**: short, lowercase, no underscores — `wal`, `mvcc`, `hal`, `wire`

## World Layout

```
     west  ←  Z=0 (spawn)  →  east
              │
Z < 0         │         Z > 0
WAL lecterns  │         user table data
(transaction  │         (banner+sign strips
 log books)   │          standing on grass)
              │
         underground (Y < 60)
         catalog barrels + control block
```

- **Z > 0, Y=64** — user table data. Table N (N >= 1) starts at Z = (N-1) × 10000. Each row is a strip of banners and signs along X.
- **Z < 0, Y=64** — WAL lecterns. Each lectern is one transaction log entry. Walk west = older transactions.
- **Underground (Y=10)** — catalog (table metadata as barrels) and control block at (0, 10, 0). Never visible to users.

## Layer Responsibilities

Understanding which layer owns what prevents putting logic in the wrong place:

| Layer | Owns | Does NOT own |
|---|---|---|
| `wire` | Postgres protocol framing, message types | SQL parsing, query logic |
| `parser` | AST construction from SQL string | planning, execution |
| `planner` | Choosing scan strategy, plan tree | executing plans |
| `executor` | Iterating over plan, producing rows | storage format, Minecraft |
| `storage` | Row encoding, strip layout, table metadata | WAL, MVCC, Minecraft |
| `wal` | Log entry write/read, crash recovery | storage format details |
| `mvcc` | Transaction IDs, xmin/xmax visibility | row encoding |
| `hal` | TCP connection to plugin, block I/O | everything above |

**Critical rule**: the `hal` package must never import any other internal package. It is the bottom of the dependency graph.

---

## Storage Format

Rows use a hybrid banner+sign layout. Each row occupies a fixed-width strip of blocks along X at Y=64, Z=(tableZStart + rowIndex):

- **Banners 0–1**: xmin (int64, 8 bytes across 2 banners)
- **Banners 2–3**: xmax (int64, null = 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF)
- **Banners 4..N**: INT/BIGINT/BOOLEAN columns in ordinal order. INT = 1 banner (4 bytes, 2 wasted). BIGINT = 2 banners. BOOLEAN = 1 banner.
- **Signs 0..M**: TEXT columns. One standing OAK_SIGN per TEXT column (4 lines × 16 chars = 64 chars max).

Banner byte encoding — each of the 6 pattern layers encodes 1 byte:
- High nibble (bits 7–4) = pattern type index 0–15
- Low nibble (bits 3–0) = dye color index 0–15 (WHITE=0 ... BLACK=15)

Codec lives in `internal/storage/codec.go`. All encode/decode functions are there.

WAL entries are lecterns at Z < 0, Y=64. Each lectern holds a written book with pages: LSN + TXID + STATUS, operation + table ID, target coordinates, new value summary. Open a lectern in-game to read the transaction log.

Catalog rows and control block use barrel+JSON (internal only, not banner encoding).

## The HAL Interface

All Minecraft I/O goes through this interface. Do not call the plugin TCP connection directly from outside the `hal` package:

```go
type Storage interface {
    ReadBlock(ctx context.Context, x, y, z int) ([]byte, error)
    WriteBlock(ctx context.Context, x, y, z int, blockType byte, data []byte) error
    BatchRead(ctx context.Context, positions []BlockPos) ([][]byte, error)
    BatchWrite(ctx context.Context, writes []BlockWrite) error
    ForceLoadChunk(ctx context.Context, chunkX, chunkZ int) error
    IsChunkLoaded(ctx context.Context, chunkX, chunkZ int) (bool, error)
}

type BlockWrite struct {
    Pos       BlockPos
    BlockType byte
    Data      []byte
}
```

Block type constants defined in `internal/hal/hal.go`:
```go
const (
    BlockTypeBarrel  byte = 0x00
    BlockTypeBanner  byte = 0x01
    BlockTypeSign    byte = 0x02
    BlockTypeLectern byte = 0x03
)
```

---

## WAL Rules

These are invariants. Never break them:

1. **WAL entry must be written and ACKed before the data block write begins**
2. **WAL entry must be marked COMMITTED only after the data block write is ACKed**
3. **On startup, WAL recovery must complete before the wire server accepts connections**
4. **Never truncate a WAL entry that is still PENDING**

---

## MVCC Rules

- Every row written by the storage layer must have `xmin` set to the current transaction ID and `xmax` set to null
- A DELETE sets `xmax` on the existing row — it never removes the block
- An UPDATE is always a DELETE + INSERT — never mutate a row in place
- A SELECT must filter rows through the MVCC visibility check before returning them
- The transaction ID counter is persisted in the control block at `(0, 10, 0)` — always read it on startup, never assume it starts at 1

---

## Testing

- Unit tests live alongside the package they test (`internal/storage/storage_test.go`)
- Integration tests that require a live Minecraft connection are in `internal/hal/integration_test.go` and are skipped unless `MINESQL_MINECRAFT_ADDR` is set
- When writing tests for the storage layer, use the `hal/mock` package — never require a real Minecraft server for unit tests
- Test table names should use `t.Name()` to avoid collisions between parallel tests

---

## Security Considerations

- The plugin TCP server (port 25576) must never be exposed to the public internet — it has no authentication
- The Postgres wire server has no authentication in v1 — document this clearly
- Never log row data at INFO level — use DEBUG only
- RCON must be disabled in `server.properties` — mineSQL uses the plugin protocol exclusively

---

## Common Pitfalls

- **Chunk not loaded**: if a HAL read returns empty data unexpectedly, check whether the target chunk is forceloaded. Call `ForceLoadChunk` before any table scan.
- **WAL region**: WAL lecterns are at Z < 0. Never place user table data at negative Z.
- **txid counter on restart**: always read the control block on startup and add a safety margin (+100) before assigning new transaction IDs.
- **RCON vs plugin**: do not use RCON for any data operations. The plugin TCP server is the only I/O path.
- **Banner encoding**: each banner encodes exactly 6 bytes. INT = 1 banner (4 bytes, 2 wasted). BIGINT = 2 banners. TEXT uses signs not banners. Never mix.
- **Standing blocks**: use standing banners (WHITE_BANNER) and floor signs (OAK_SIGN) — wall variants need a backing block and will not survive placement in open air.
