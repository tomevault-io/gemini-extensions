# Testing Patterns and Practices

---

## Test Organization Best Practices

### 1. Group Tests by Feature

```python
class TestBasicFeatures:
    """Test basic worker functionality."""
    def test_initialization(self, worker_mode): ...
    def test_method_call(self, worker_mode): ...

class TestPoolFeatures:
    """Test worker pool features."""
    def test_load_balancing(self, pool_mode): ...
```

### 2. Use Descriptive Test Names

```python
# ✅ Good: Clear what is being tested
def test_wait_returns_done_and_not_done_sets(self, worker_mode): ...
def test_gather_preserves_input_order(self, worker_mode): ...

# ❌ Bad: Unclear
def test_wait(self, worker_mode): ...
def test_gather_works(self, worker_mode): ...
```

### 3. Always Clean Up Resources

```python
def test_feature(self, worker_mode):
    w = MyWorker.options(mode=worker_mode).init()
    result = w.method().result()
    assert result == expected
    w.stop()  # Pytest calls this even if assertion fails
```

---

## Common Testing Patterns

```python
# Pattern 1: Synchronization primitives
def test_wait_and_gather(self, worker_mode):
    w = MyWorker.options(mode=worker_mode).init()
    futures = [w.compute(i) for i in range(10)]
    done, not_done = wait(futures, timeout=5.0)
    results = gather(futures, timeout=5.0)
    w.stop()

# Pattern 2: Exception handling
def test_gather_with_exceptions(self, worker_mode):
    w = MyWorker.options(mode=worker_mode).init()
    futures = [w.compute(1), w.failing_method(), w.compute(3)]
    results = gather(futures, return_exceptions=True, timeout=5.0)
    assert isinstance(results[1], ValueError)
    w.stop()

# Pattern 3: Timeouts
def test_timeout(self, worker_mode):
    if worker_mode == "sync":
        pytest.skip("Sync mode completes immediately")
    w = MyWorker.options(mode=worker_mode).init()
    with pytest.raises(TimeoutError):
        w.slow_task(duration=5.0).result(timeout=0.1)
    w.stop()

# Pattern 4: Edge cases - empty, single, mixed types
def test_edge_cases(self, worker_mode):
    assert len(wait([])[0]) == 0  # Empty
    assert len(wait(single_future)[0]) == 1  # Single
    assert gather([future, 42, future2]) == [r1, 42, r2]  # Mixed
```

## Ray-Specific Testing

```python
# Always include runtime_env when manually initializing
import ray, morphic, concurry
ray.init(
    ignore_reinit_error=True,
    num_cpus=4,
    runtime_env={"py_modules": [concurry, morphic]}
)

# Test Ray-specific features
@pytest.mark.skipif(not _IS_RAY_INSTALLED, reason="Ray not installed")
def test_ray_actor_options(self):
    w = MyWorker.options(
        mode="ray",
        actor_options={"num_cpus": 1}
    ).init()
    w.stop()
```

## Fixing Failing Tests: NEVER Skip, Always Fix

### Critical Rule: Fix Implementation, Don't Skip Tests

When an existing test fails, the problem is usually the implementation, not the test. Your responsibility:
1. Identify the root cause
2. Fix the implementation to make the test pass
3. NEVER skip or comment out failing tests

### Decision Tree for Failing Tests

```
Test fails
   ├── Test wrong/outdated? → Ask user before modifying
   ├── NEW test you wrote? → Fix your test or implementation
   ├── Small fix (<50 lines, single file)? → Fix autonomously
   └── Large fix (multiple files, architectural)? → STOP and ask user
```

### When to Fix Autonomously vs. Ask User

**Small Fix (Do it)**: Off-by-one errors, missing checks, wrong operators, typos, missing imports, wrong exception types

**Large Fix (Ask user)**: New classes, API changes, 3+ files affected, architectural decisions, unclear behavior, 100+ lines of new logic

**Test Might Be Wrong (Ask user)**: Test expects value X, implementation returns Y, unclear which is correct

### Examples

✅ **Autonomous Fix**: "Test expects 3 retries but gets 2. Fixed off-by-one error in retry.py line 145."

✅ **Stop and Ask**: "Test fails due to unpicklable Lock in LimitPool. Fix requires refactoring to use multiprocessing.Manager() across 5 files. Proceed?"

✅ **Ask About Test**: "Test expects timeout=5.0 but config has 10.0. Which is correct?"

❌ **NEVER Skip**: `pytest.skip("Test fails for process mode")` - This hides bugs!

❌ **NEVER Comment Out**: `# def test_feature():` - This breaks functionality silently!

❌ **NEVER Change Test Without Understanding**: Changing assertions to match wrong behavior hides bugs!

### Acceptable Reasons to Skip Tests

1. **Feature not supported by mode**: `max_workers > 1` not supported by sync/asyncio
2. **External dependency missing**: Ray not installed, OS feature unavailable
3. **User explicitly requested**: Expensive/long-running tests temporarily disabled

### Debugging Strategy

1. Read error message: What failed? Expected vs. actual?
2. Understand test intent: What feature? What behavior?
3. Trace execution: Where does it diverge?
4. Identify root cause: Logic error? Config? Race condition?
5. Determine complexity: Small fix (do it) or large fix (ask)?
6. Implement and verify: Fix, test, check regressions

### Common Test Failure Patterns

**Timing/Race**: Test flaky → Add synchronization or increase timeout
**Mode-Specific**: Fails some modes → Fix implementation, not test
**Config Changes**: Expects old default → Ask user which is correct
**Missing Feature**: Method doesn't exist → Implement or ask about priority

---

## Summary Checklist

✅ Use `worker_mode` or `pool_mode` fixtures to test all execution modes
✅ Fix failing tests by fixing implementation, never skip to hide bugs
✅ Small fixes (<50 lines): do autonomously; large fixes: ask user
✅ Always clean up with `w.stop()`; use descriptive test names
✅ Test edge cases (empty, single, mixed), exceptions, timeouts
✅ Include Ray runtime_env: `runtime_env={"py_modules": [concurry, morphic]}`

## Testing Shared Limits

### Why Shared Limit Testing is Critical

Shared limit enforcement is challenging to test because:
- **Timing Variability**: Ray/process/thread modes have different scheduling characteristics
- **Race Conditions**: Must catch TOCTOU bugs and capacity violations
- **Async Scheduling**: Ray's async execution makes precise timing assertions unreliable

### Testing Strategy: Explicit Acquisition Tracking

**Key Insight**: Track explicit acquisition events, not wall-clock timing.

**Test Pattern** (see `tests/core/limit/test_shared_limits.py::TestSharedLimitAcquisitionTracking`):

```python
def test_shared_limit_behavior(self, worker_mode):
    """Test [specific behavior].
    
    What this validates:
    - [Property 1]
    - [Property 2]
    
    Logical constraints (MUST hold):
    1. [Constraint with reasoning]
    2. [Constraint with reasoning]
    """
    class TrackingWorker(Worker):
        def hold_resource(self, hold_time: float) -> dict:
            import time
            request_time = time.time()
            
            with self.limits.acquire(requested={"resource": 1}):
                grant_time = time.time()
                wait_time = grant_time - request_time
                time.sleep(hold_time)
                release_time = time.time()
                
                return {
                    "request_time": request_time,
                    "grant_time": grant_time,
                    "release_time": release_time,
                    "wait_time": wait_time,
                }
    
    # Create shared limits and workers
    # Submit tasks
    # Validate logical constraints (not exact timings)
    # Check capacity never exceeded
```

### Timing Thresholds for Shared Limits

**Use generous thresholds that account for execution mode overhead:**

| Threshold | Purpose | Rationale |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| `< 0.6s` | "Immediate" acquisition | Ray scheduling delay + still catches bugs |
| `>= 0.4s` | "Waited" for resource | Catches premature acquisition |
| `>= 0.9s` | "Waited full duration" | Validates full hold time (1s - epsilon) |

**Key Principle**: Thresholds should be:
- **Loose enough** to handle Ray/process scheduling variations
- **Tight enough** to catch actual bugs (e.g., limits not shared)

### Critical Validations

**1. Timeline Analysis (Capacity Never Exceeded):**
```python
# Build timeline of grant/release events
events = []
for r in results:
    events.append(("grant", r["grant_time"], r["worker_id"]))
    events.append(("release", r["release_time"], r["worker_id"]))
events.sort(key=lambda e: e[1])

# Track concurrent holdings
current_holdings = set()
max_concurrent = 0
for event_type, timestamp, worker_id in events:
    if event_type == "grant":
        current_holdings.add(worker_id)
        max_concurrent = max(max_concurrent, len(current_holdings))
    else:
        current_holdings.discard(worker_id)

# CRITICAL: Max concurrent MUST NOT exceed capacity
assert max_concurrent <= capacity
```

**2. Sequential Wave Validation:**
```python
# Wave 2 cannot acquire before Wave 1 releases
wave1_latest_release = max(r["release_time"] for r in wave1)
wave2_earliest_grant = min(r["grant_time"] for r in wave2)
assert wave2_earliest_grant >= wave1_latest_release - 0.1
```

**3. Total Elapsed Time (More Robust than Individual Timings):**
```python
# Total time MUST show sequential waves
assert total_elapsed >= 1.9  # Two 1s waves - epsilon
assert total_elapsed < 3.0   # Not three sequential waves
```

### What NOT to Test

❌ **Bad**: `assert task_wait_time == 1.0` (exact timing)
❌ **Bad**: `assert 3 <= immediate <= 4` (depends on which tasks start first)
❌ **Bad**: `assert waited >= 2` (depends on Ray scheduling order)
❌ **Bad**: Assuming FIFO ordering of waiting tasks (not guaranteed)

✅ **Good**: `assert total_elapsed >= 1.5` (logical minimum - proves sharing)
✅ **Good**: `assert max_concurrent <= capacity` (hard constraint - MUST hold)
✅ **Good**: `assert not all_immediate` (at least one task waited)

### Example Tests

See `tests/core/limit/test_shared_limits.py::TestSharedLimitAcquisitionTracking`:
- `test_shared_resource_limit_sequential_waves`: Validates wave pattern
- `test_shared_resource_limit_precise_capacity_enforcement`: Timeline analysis

**For full details**, see [Architecture: Limits - Testing Section](../docs/architecture/limits.md#testing-shared-limit-enforcement).

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ Hardcoding mode: `mode="thread"` (use `worker_mode` fixture)
❌ Skipping failing tests to hide bugs
❌ Not cleaning up: missing `w.stop()`
❌ Unclear test names: `test_1()` instead of `test_feature_behavior()`
❌ Testing only happy path without exception handling
❌ Exact timing assertions for shared limits (use logical constraints instead)
