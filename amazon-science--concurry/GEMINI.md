## coding-style

> Code style rules — naming, guard clauses, dispatch, variable reassignment, mutation, strings, truncation, imports.

# Code Style
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines (enforced by Ruff)
- Use descriptive variable names: `timeout_seconds` not `t`, `worker_count` not `n`
- Boolean variables and functions: prefix with `is_`, `has_`, `can_`, `should_`
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose (Single Responsibility Principle)
- Add comprehensive docstrings for all public APIs (Google style with Args/Returns/Raises)
- Include usage examples in docstrings for complex functionality

## Guard Clauses and Early Returns

Reduce nesting by checking preconditions first and returning/raising early. This keeps the happy path at low indentation and makes control flow obvious.

❌ Bad (deeply nested):
```python
def process_task(self, task: Task) -> Result:
    if task is not None:
        if task.is_valid():
            if self._is_running:
                return self._execute(task)
            else:
                raise WorkerStoppedError()
        else:
            raise InvalidTaskError()
    else:
        raise ValueError("task is None")
```

✅ Good (guard clauses):
```python
def process_task(self, task: Task) -> Result:
    if task is None:
        raise ValueError("task is None")
    if not task.is_valid():
        raise InvalidTaskError()
    if not self._is_running:
        raise WorkerStoppedError()
    return self._execute(task)
```

## Exhaustive Dispatch: `if-elif-else` with a Raising `else`

When a variable has a **closed set of valid values** and you are dispatching behavior based on it, always use a full `if-elif-else` ladder where the `else` branch raises an exception. This makes two things immediately clear to the reader: (a) exactly which values are handled, and (b) that no value falls through silently.

Contrast this with a **feature flag** (a boolean or optional condition that enables/disables a behavior). Feature flags correctly use a bare `if` with no `else`, because the "else" case is "do nothing, proceed normally" — not an error.

**Closed-set dispatch — ALWAYS use `if-elif-else` with raising `else`:**

❌ Bad (validate-then-dispatch — reader must remember the set of valid values):
```python
algorithm: str = config.get("load_balancing", "round_robin")
if algorithm not in ("round_robin", "least_loaded", "random"):
    raise ValueError(f"Unknown algorithm={algorithm!r}")

if algorithm == "round_robin":
    return RoundRobinBalancer(...)
if algorithm == "least_loaded":
    return LeastLoadedBalancer(...)
return RandomBalancer(...)  # ← reader must infer this is the "random" case
```

✅ Good (exhaustive dispatch — every case is explicit, invalid values caught):
```python
if algorithm == "round_robin":
    return RoundRobinBalancer(...)
elif algorithm == "least_loaded":
    return LeastLoadedBalancer(...)
elif algorithm == "random":
    return RandomBalancer(...)
else:
    raise ValueError(
        f"Unknown load_balancing algorithm={algorithm!r}. "
        f"Must be 'round_robin', 'least_loaded', or 'random'."
    )
```

**Why the `else` matters:** Without it, adding a fourth algorithm value later silently falls through to the last branch. With `else: raise`, the new value is caught immediately. This is the textual equivalent of a `match/case` with exhaustiveness checking.

**Feature flag — bare `if` is correct:**

✅ Good (optional behavior, not a dispatch):
```python
if self.enable_metrics:
    self._metrics_collector.record(elapsed_ms)
```

Here, the `if` block enables an optional feature. There is no `else` because the alternative is "don't record metrics" — that is a valid default, not an error. An `else` branch would be empty noise.

**Decision rule:** Ask "is the `else` case an error, or is it 'do nothing'?"
- **Error** (closed set dispatch) → `if-elif-else` with raising `else`
- **Do nothing** (feature flag) → bare `if`, no `else`

## Naming Conventions

- `snake_case` for functions, methods, variables, modules
- `CamelCase` for classes
- `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for module-level constants
- Prefix private attributes with `_`: `self._internal_state`
- Name by intent, not implementation: `failed_futures` not `bad_list`
- Include units where ambiguous: `timeout_seconds`, `max_retries`, `delay_ms`
- Avoid abbreviations: `configuration` not `cfg`, `response` not `resp`, `message` not `msg`

## Never Rename Variables Just to Shorten Them (Namespace Pollution)

**Never create a new local variable that is just a shorter or abbreviated alias for an existing parameter, attribute, or variable.** This is namespace pollution: it forces the reader to hold two names for the same value in their head, and the shorter name invariably loses the meaning that the original name carried.

This pattern is one of the most damaging things an LLM can do to a codebase. The original variable was named carefully — `load_balancing_algorithm` tells you exactly what it is: the algorithm for load balancing. When the LLM renames it to `algorithm`, the reader now sees a generic word that could refer to *any* algorithm in a codebase that has multiple algorithm concepts (load balancing algorithm, rate limit algorithm, retry algorithm, polling algorithm). The reader must scroll back to the assignment `algorithm = load_balancing_algorithm` to figure out which algorithm it is. That scroll-and-remember cost is paid on every single read of the function, forever.

**Why LLMs do this:** LLMs are trained on codebases where variable renaming is common for two reasons: (1) reducing line length (a cosmetic concern that tools like Black handle automatically), and (2) Python convention of abbreviating `self.long_attribute` to a local when accessed many times. Both reasons are wrong in this context. Line length is never a reason to sacrifice clarity. And accessing `self.long_attribute` directly is *better* than creating a local alias because it tells the reader *where* the value lives.

**The rule is absolute:** if a variable already has a name, use that name. Do not create a second name for it.

**Form 1: Renaming a parameter to a shorter local**

❌ Bad (renames `load_balancing_algorithm` to `algorithm` — now reader must remember which algorithm):
```python
def create_balancer(self, *, load_balancing_algorithm: str, ...) -> LoadBalancer:
    algorithm: str = load_balancing_algorithm
    if algorithm not in ("round_robin", "least_loaded", "random"):
        raise ValueError(f"Unknown algorithm={algorithm!r}")
    if algorithm == "round_robin":
        ...
```

✅ Good (use the original name — it is perfectly clear):
```python
def create_balancer(self, *, load_balancing_algorithm: str, ...) -> LoadBalancer:
    if load_balancing_algorithm not in ("round_robin", "least_loaded", "random"):
        raise ValueError(
            f"Unknown load_balancing_algorithm={load_balancing_algorithm!r}. "
            f"Must be 'round_robin', 'least_loaded', or 'random'."
        )
    if load_balancing_algorithm == "round_robin":
        ...
```

**Form 2: Abbreviating a parameter to save characters**

❌ Bad (`futs` and `wrks` are opaque abbreviations — reader must scroll to the assignment):
```python
def gather_results(self, *, futures: List[Future], workers: List[WorkerProxy], ...) -> ...:
    futs: List[Future] = futures
    wrks: List[WorkerProxy] = workers
```

✅ Good (keep the original names):
```python
def gather_results(self, *, futures: List[Future], workers: List[WorkerProxy], ...) -> ...:
    # Use `futures` and `workers` directly — they already have perfect names.
```

If you genuinely need a new variable (e.g., because the value is transformed — filtered, sorted, resolved from `None`), give it a name that describes *what changed*, not a shorter version of the original. `completed_futures` tells you "these are the done ones." `futs` tells you nothing.

**Form 3: Creating a local alias for `self.attribute` or `obj.attribute`**

❌ Bad (creates a local `cfg` that aliases `global_config.defaults` — reader must remember what `cfg` is):
```python
cfg = global_config.defaults
timeout = cfg.worker_timeout
max_retries = cfg.num_retries
```

✅ Good (access the attribute path directly — it is self-documenting):
```python
timeout = global_config.defaults.worker_timeout
max_retries = global_config.defaults.num_retries
```

✅ Also acceptable (when accessing many fields, a well-named local is justified — but name it descriptively):
```python
default_config: ResolvedDefaults = global_config.defaults
timeout = default_config.worker_timeout
max_retries = default_config.num_retries
```

The difference: `default_config` tells the reader exactly what it is. `cfg` is a three-letter abbreviation that could be anything.

**Form 4: Chained aliasing — the most egregious variant**

This is when the LLM creates multiple aliases in a chain, each one stripping more context from the name. The reader now has to hold THREE names in their head for what is a single two-level attribute access. This is the worst form of namespace pollution because each link in the chain makes the code harder to follow, not easier.

❌ Bad (three variables for `worker_proxy.retry_config.max_retries` — completely unacceptable):
```python
retry_cfg: RetryConfig = worker_proxy.retry_config        # alias 1
max_r: int = retry_cfg.max_retries                        # alias 2
# ... later ...
if attempts > max_r:                                      # uses alias 2
```

The reader sees `max_r` and must trace backward: `max_r` came from `retry_cfg.max_retries`, which came from `worker_proxy.retry_config.max_retries`. Three names, zero added value.

✅ Good (use the original path — it is perfectly clear):
```python
if attempts > worker_proxy.retry_config.max_retries:
    ...
```

No aliases. No mental bookkeeping. Every reference tells the reader where the value comes from.

**When creating a new local variable IS appropriate:**
- The value is **transformed**: filtered, sorted, resolved from `None`, cast to a different type. The new name should describe the transformation: `completed_futures`, `active_workers`, `filtered_results`.
- The value is **a loop-mutation target**: `current_worker = initial_worker` where `current_worker` is reassigned during failover. The name `current_worker` conveys that it changes; `initial_worker` conveys that it does not.
- The attribute path is **deeply nested** (3+ levels of indexing/attribute access) AND the expression is error-prone to retype. At 3+ levels, the expression becomes hard to read inline and easy to mistype.
- **Loop variables and comprehension variables** are always fine — they are iteration bindings, not aliases.

**The depth threshold — when an alias starts being useful:**

Single-level access (`self.attribute`, `obj.field`, `dict["key"]`, `list[0]`) is never worth aliasing. It is short, self-documenting, and tells the reader *where* the value lives. Two-level access (`worker_proxy.retry_config`) is borderline but usually fine inline — the full path is still readable and the reader sees exactly which object the value comes from. At three or more levels of chained access, a local variable starts being justified because the expression is long enough to be error-prone when repeated:

❌ Bad (single-level — just use the original):
```python
limits: List[Limit] = pool.limits
# ... later ...
for limit in limits:  # ← reader must scroll to see where limits came from
```

✅ Good (single-level — use the attribute path directly):
```python
for limit in pool.limits:  # ← reader sees the source immediately
```

❌ Bad (single-level alias of a parameter — pointless renaming):
```python
v: MyType = self.var_name
idx: int = self.var_dict[0]
val: str = self.var_dict["key"]
```

✅ Good (just reference them directly):
```python
# Use self.var_name, self.var_dict[0], self.var_dict["key"] inline.
```

✅ Good (3+ levels — a local IS justified because the expression is error-prone):
```python
retry_wait: float = self._proxy_map[worker_id].retry_config.wait_seconds
```

These deeply nested chains are hard to retype correctly and obscure when inlined in a larger expression. A descriptively named local is genuinely helpful here.

## Prefer Variable Reassignment for Same-Concept Transformations (CRITICAL)

When a variable goes through a transformation but represents **the same conceptual entity** (same type, same purpose, just processed further), **reassign to the same variable name** rather than inventing a new name. A new name for the same concept forces the reader and the LLM agent to track two names for one thing, which increases cognitive load without adding information.

**The decision rule:** ask **"After the transformation, is this conceptually the same entity?"**
- **Yes** (same type, same purpose, just cleaned/filtered/enriched) → reassign to the same name
- **No** (the type changes, or the new value represents a fundamentally different concept) → use a new, descriptive name

✅ Good (reassignment — conceptual identity preserved):
```python
## Build worker proxies for all modes
workers: List[WorkerProxy] = [self._create_proxy(i) for i in range(count)]

## Filter to only healthy workers
workers = [w for w in workers if w.is_healthy()]
```

`workers` is still "the workers" — they are just filtered now. The comprehension makes the transformation obvious. A new name like `healthy_workers` or `filtered_workers` adds a second binding that the reader (and the LLM) must track, for zero informational benefit when the old value is no longer needed.

❌ Bad (new name for the same concept — now the reader tracks two names):
```python
workers: List[WorkerProxy] = [self._create_proxy(i) for i in range(count)]
healthy_workers: List[WorkerProxy] = [w for w in workers if w.is_healthy()]
```

Now the reader sees both `workers` and `healthy_workers` in scope and must remember that `healthy_workers` is the one to use downstream. If a later edit accidentally uses `workers` instead, the code silently includes unhealthy workers. With reassignment, the old value is gone — there is only one name and it always refers to the latest version.

✅ Good (new name — conceptual identity changes):
```python
raw_response: bytes = socket.recv(4096)
parsed_message: Message = Message.from_bytes(raw_response)
```

`raw_response` is bytes from a socket. `parsed_message` is a `Message` — completely different type, completely different concept. A new name is essential here.

**Conditional reassignment — DANGEROUS, avoid:**

**Never conditionally reassign a variable** unless the variable is immediately consumed on the next line or in the very next statement. Conditional reassignment creates a variable whose value depends on a branch, which is hard to reason about and almost impossible for an LLM to track reliably.

❌ Bad (conditional reassignment — which version does `futures` hold?):
```python
futures: List[Future] = submit_batch(tasks)
if enable_timeout_filtering:
    futures = filter_timed_out(futures)
# ... 30 lines later ...
# Reader must remember: did enable_timeout_filtering fire? What state is futures in?
results = gather(futures)
```

✅ Good (separate names make the state explicit):
```python
futures: List[Future] = submit_batch(tasks)
filtered_futures: List[Future] = (
    filter_timed_out(futures) if enable_timeout_filtering else futures
)
results = gather(filtered_futures)
```

Here the conceptual identity genuinely changes: raw futures vs. filtered futures. The conditional makes them different things, so they get different names. After the assignment, the reader knows exactly which version `filtered_futures` holds, regardless of the `enable_timeout_filtering` flag.

**Unconditional reassignment — SAFE, preferred:**

When the reassignment is unconditional (always happens, no branches), use the same name:

```python
## Collect futures from all workers
futures: List[Future] = [w.submit(task) for w in workers for task in tasks]

## Deduplicate by task ID
futures = deduplicate_futures(futures)

## Sort by submission time for deterministic ordering
futures = sorted(futures, key=lambda f: f.submitted_at)
```

Each step transforms `futures` unconditionally. The reader sees a clean pipeline. There is no ambiguity about which version of `futures` exists at any point — it is always the latest.

## Avoid Mutating Caller-Supplied Parameters (Prefer Comprehensions and Return Values)

**Prefer returning new values over mutating parameters that were passed to you by a caller.** When a function receives a list, dict, or other mutable container from its caller, modifying that container in-place creates invisible action-at-a-distance: the caller's variable changes without any visible assignment on the caller's side. This is a common source of bugs, especially when LLM agents generate code that reads the caller and the callee independently without seeing the full picture.

**Mutating your own local variables is fine.** This rule applies to parameters passed in from outside, not to variables you created within the function.

**The decision rule:**
- **Own local variable** (you created it in this function) → mutate freely, including `my_list[0] = "abcd"`, `.append()`, `.update()`, etc.
- **Caller-supplied parameter** (passed as an argument) → prefer returning a new value. If in-place mutation is genuinely needed (performance-critical, very large data structure), document it in the docstring.

**Prefer comprehensions over in-place mutation loops:**

When building or transforming collections, list comprehensions, dict comprehensions, and generator expressions are preferred over loops that mutate a container element-by-element. Comprehensions make the intent clear in a single expression — the reader sees the full transformation at once rather than tracing through a loop body to understand what changes.

This is not always possible (some transformations have complex conditional logic or side effects that do not fit a comprehension), but it should be the default.

❌ Bad (mutates the caller's list in-place — caller does not expect this):
```python
def tag_futures(futures: List[Future], tag: str) -> None:
    for i in range(len(futures)):
        futures[i] = futures[i].with_tag(tag)  # ← caller's list silently modified
```

✅ Good (returns a new list — caller sees the transformation at the assignment):
```python
def tag_futures(futures: List[Future], tag: str) -> List[Future]:
    return [future.with_tag(tag) for future in futures]

# Caller:
futures = tag_futures(futures, tag="priority")
```

The caller's reassignment (`futures = ...`) makes the transformation visible. Without it, the caller's `futures` would silently change after the function call — no assignment, no signal.

❌ Bad (in-place loop mutation where a comprehension is cleaner):
```python
results: Dict[str, float] = {}
for worker_id, timings in timing_dict.items():
    results[worker_id] = sum(timings) / len(timings)
```

✅ Good (dict comprehension — intent is clear in one expression):
```python
results: Dict[str, float] = {
    worker_id: sum(timings) / len(timings)
    for worker_id, timings in timing_dict.items()
}
```

**When in-place mutation of parameters IS acceptable:**

- **Explicit accumulator pattern:** The function's entire purpose is to populate a container passed to it, and this is documented: `def populate_results(*, results: Dict[str, float], batch: Batch) -> None:`. The docstring should say "Mutates `results` in-place."
- **Performance-critical code** with very large data structures where creating a copy would be prohibitively expensive.
- **Framework hooks** where the API contract specifies mutation (e.g., Morphic's `pre_initialize(cls, data: dict)` which mutates `data` by design).

## String Formatting

- **Always use f-strings** (Python 3.6+), not `.format()` or `%` formatting
- f-strings are faster, more readable, and less error-prone

❌ Bad:
```python
log.info("Worker {} started with {} tasks".format(worker_id, task_count))
log.info("Worker %s started with %d tasks" % (worker_id, task_count))
```

✅ Good:
```python
log.info(f"Worker {worker_id} started with {task_count} tasks")
```

## Never Truncate String Content in Logs or Outputs

**Never slice or truncate strings when logging, printing, or writing output.** Show the full content, always. This is a critical rule, not a style preference. It has **zero exceptions**.

LLM coding assistants reflexively insert truncation guards like `text[:200] + "..."` because their training data is full of web applications where long strings must be clipped for UI display. In library and infrastructure code, this is actively harmful and absolutely not allowed. If a string is worth logging, it is worth showing in full. Truncation hides the exact data needed for debugging and makes failures irreproducible.

**Why truncation is never appropriate:**

1. **Debugging requires full context.** When a worker fails, the error message, the input that caused it, and the stack trace must be complete. A truncated error message is useless. A truncated input means you cannot reproduce the failure. A truncated retry log means you cannot diagnose why the retry strategy did not recover.
2. **Disk is free; debugging time is not.** A log line that is 2000 characters instead of 200 costs an extra 1.8 KB on disk. A debugging session caused by truncated data costs hours.
3. **It is the caller's job to filter, not the library's job to truncate.** Concurry is a library consumed by other codebases. If Concurry silently truncates content in its logs, error messages, or worker outputs, every consumer inherits that data loss with no way to recover it. The library must never silently discard content.
4. **Concurrency bugs are especially hard to reproduce.** Race conditions, deadlocks, and timing-dependent failures are the hardest bugs in this codebase. When they occur, the logged state at the moment of failure is often the only evidence. Truncating that evidence is unacceptable.

❌ Bad (truncation in logging):
```python
log.info(f"Task input: {task_data[:100]}...")
log.error(f"Error (truncated): {error_msg[:200]}")
log.warning(f"Worker state: {repr(state)[:500]}")
```

✅ Good (full content, always):
```python
log.info(f"Task input: {task_data}")
log.error(f"Error: {error_msg}")
log.warning(f"Worker state: {repr(state)}")
```

**This rule has zero exceptions.** If a particular output is too verbose for the console during normal runs, control it with the verbosity level — do not truncate the content itself.

## Import Ordering

Follow PEP 8 / isort convention. Three groups separated by blank lines:

```python
# 1. Standard library
import os
import time
from typing import List, Optional

# 2. Third-party
import ray

# 3. Local/project
from concurry.config import global_config
from concurry.core.worker import Worker
```

## All Imports at the Top of the File (No Inline Imports)

**Every import statement MUST go at the top of the file.** Never place `import` or `from ... import` inside a function, method, or class body.

LLM coding assistants habitually produce inline imports. They do this because they generate code incrementally and inserting an import at the top of a file they are editing mid-function is inconvenient for them. This is an LLM workflow limitation, not a valid coding practice. The result is imports scattered throughout the file: `from datetime import datetime` appears at the top AND inside a method 1400 lines later, `import json` shows up in three different functions, and `import re` is buried inside a parser. This makes the dependency surface of the module invisible — you cannot glance at the top of the file and know what it depends on.

**Why inline imports are harmful:**

1. **Hidden dependencies.** The top-level import block is the module's manifest of external dependencies. An import buried in line 800 is invisible when reviewing the file header, when running dependency analysis tools, and when auditing for circular imports.
2. **Redundant re-imports.** Python caches modules in `sys.modules` so repeated imports are cheap, but they are visual noise. When `from datetime import datetime` appears at line 10 AND line 800, a reader does not know whether the second import is redundant or whether it was added because the first was removed at some point. It creates ambiguity where none should exist.
3. **False signal about import cost.** Inline imports in mainstream Python codebases signal "this import is expensive or optional." When you put `import torch` inside a function, a reader infers "we only want to pay the torch import cost if this function is called." Placing `from datetime import datetime` inline sends the same signal about a module that takes microseconds to import — it is a false alarm that wastes the reader's attention.
4. **Circular import workarounds that should not exist.** If an inline import exists to break a circular import, the circular dependency is the bug. Fix the module structure instead of hiding the cycle inside a function body.

❌ Bad (inline import of a standard library module):
```python
import asyncio  # Already at top of file!

class ThreadWorkerProxy(WorkerProxy):
    def _start_result_thread(self):
        import asyncio  # ❌ Redundant inline import
        loop = asyncio.new_event_loop()
```

❌ Bad (inline import of a project module):
```python
def _create_balancer(self):
    from concurry.core.limit.balancer import RoundRobinBalancer  # ❌ Inline project import
    return RoundRobinBalancer(self._workers)
```

❌ Bad (inline import of a third-party module):
```python
def _serialize_state(self):
    import json  # ❌ stdlib, should be at top
    return json.dumps(self._state)
```

✅ Good (all imports at the top):
```python
import asyncio
import json
import os
from typing import Any, Dict, List, Optional

import ray

from concurry.config import global_config
from concurry.core.limit.balancer import RoundRobinBalancer
```

**The only two exceptions where inline imports are acceptable:**

1. **Concurry `Worker` methods and `@task` functions** that may be serialized and sent to a Ray cluster. Ray serializes the function bytecode and executes it in a remote process where the module's top-level imports may not be available. In this case, the import MUST be inside the function so it runs in the remote context. Mark these with a comment:
```python
class MyWorker(Worker):
    def process(self, data):
        # Inline import required: Worker methods execute in Ray remote context
        import numpy as np
        return np.mean(data)
```

2. **Truly optional dependencies** that should not cause an import error when the module is loaded. Use `morphic.optional_dependency` for these — never a bare inline `import`:
```python
from morphic.imports import optional_dependency

with optional_dependency("ray", error="ignore"):
    import ray
    RAY_AVAILABLE = True
```

**If you see an inline import that does not fall into one of these two categories, move it to the top of the file.**
