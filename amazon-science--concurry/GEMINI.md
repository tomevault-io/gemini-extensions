# Type Hints and Typing Rules

## Type Hints
- **Always include type hints** for all function parameters and return values
- **Always use capitalized `typing` imports**: `List`, `Dict`, `Set`, `Tuple`, `Optional`, `Union`, `FrozenSet`
- Do NOT use lowercase built-in generics (`list[str]`, `dict[str, int]`) or pipe unions (`str | None`) even though Python 3.10+ supports them
- **Rationale:** Capitalized typing imports are visually distinct and grep-able. `List` is unambiguously a type annotation; `list` could be a variable name, a builtin call, or a type hint. This makes bulk find-and-replace across files reliable, and makes it immediately clear when reading code that a line involves type annotations.
- Use `-> None` for functions that return no value (side-effect functions, lifecycle hooks like `post_initialize`, `on_start`, `on_stop`)
- Use `-> NoReturn` ONLY for functions that genuinely never return (unconditional `raise`, `sys.exit()`, infinite loops)
- Include type hints for class attributes and instance variables
- **Prefer `morphic.Typed` over `TypedDict`** for structured data. `TypedDict` is a fallback for cases where `Typed` cannot be used (e.g., dicts that must remain plain `dict` for JSON serialization to a third-party API, or when the consuming code expects a raw dict, not a model). When you control both producer and consumer, use `Typed`.
- **`Protocol` is for function parameters and call-site typing, NOT for Pydantic/Typed field types.** Pydantic v2 validates Protocol fields with `isinstance()` at construction time, which (a) rejects `None` for non-Optional fields even in tests that don't exercise the field, and (b) fails on proxy objects that use `__getattr__`-based dynamic dispatch (e.g., Concurry `Worker` proxies) because Python's `isinstance` Protocol check inspects the type's `__dict__` and MRO, not dynamic attributes. Declare such fields as `Any` and document the duck-typed contract in a comment referencing the Protocol class. The Protocol provides type safety at *call sites* (IDE autocomplete, static analysis); Pydantic field validation is the wrong enforcement point.

### Strict `Any` Ban (CRITICAL)

**`Any` is as good as no typing.** Using `Any` removes the entire reason to use Morphic Typed, Pydantic, and type hints. It tells neither the reader nor the type checker what the value actually is. LLM coding assistants produce `Any` reflexively because it silences type errors without solving them.

**`Any` is ONLY acceptable in these specific situations:**

| Situation | Why `Any` is acceptable | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Pydantic/Typed fields for duck-typed workers** | Pydantic's `isinstance()` validation rejects Concurry `WorkerProxy` proxy objects; the Protocol cannot be used as a field type. | `worker: Any  # WorkerProtocol; see types.py` |
| **`_serialize_value`-style functions** | Serialization functions that genuinely accept any Python object. | `def serialize(value: Any) -> Any:` |
| **`Dict[str, Any]` for genuinely heterogeneous dicts** | When the dict's values are mixed types by design (JSON payloads, config dicts, serialized output). | `metadata: Dict[str, Any]` |
| **`**kwargs: Any`** | Catch-all for pass-through kwargs to parent classes or third-party libraries. | `**kwargs: Any` |
| **`PrivateAttr` for opaque runtime handles** | Locks, queues, processes, event loops — objects from external libraries whose type is complex or private. | `_lock: Any = PrivateAttr()` |

**`Any` is NEVER acceptable in these situations:**

| Situation | What to use instead | Example fix |
|---|---|---|
| **Function parameters where you know the type** | Use the actual type. | `task: Task` not `task: Any` |
| **Return types where you know the type** | Use the actual type. | `-> List[Future]` not `-> List[Any]` |
| **List/Dict generic parameters** | Spell out the element type. | `List[WorkerProxy]` not `List[Any]` |
| **Forward references within the same package** | Use string annotations or fix import ordering. See the Forward References rule below. | `result: "WorkerResult"` not `result: Any` |

**The test is simple:** when you write `Any`, ask: **"Do I know what type this actually is at runtime?"** If yes, write that type. If you are writing `Any` to avoid an import or to silence a type error, fix the import or the type error instead.

❌ Bad (known types hidden behind `Any`):
```python
def submit_batch(
    self,
    tasks: List[Any],              # ❌ These are Task objects
    callback: Optional[Any] = None,  # ❌ This is Callable[[Result], None]
) -> List[Any]:                    # ❌ These are Future objects
```

✅ Good (actual types everywhere they are known):
```python
def submit_batch(
    self,
    tasks: List[Task],
    callback: Optional[Callable[[Result], None]] = None,
) -> List[Future]:
```

### No `Any` for Forward References (CRITICAL)

**Never use `Any` as a workaround for forward references.** This defeats the entire purpose of Morphic Typed — if the field is typed `Any`, Pydantic cannot validate it, the IDE cannot autocomplete it, and the reader does not know what it holds.

**Forward references within the same file:** Use a string annotation (`"ClassName"`) or add `from __future__ import annotations` at the top of the file.

**Forward references across files:** Fix the import ordering. In a well-structured package, there should be no circular imports. The dependency graph flows one way. If module A needs a type from module B and module B needs a type from module A, the modules need restructuring — either extract the shared type into a lower-level module, or merge the files.

❌ Bad (using `Any` to avoid importing a type from another module):
```python
class WorkerPool(Typed):
    balancer: Any  # LoadBalancer (Any required: forward ref)
    workers: List[Any]  # List[WorkerProxy] (Any: forward ref)
```

✅ Good (import the type and use it directly):
```python
from concurry.core.limit.balancer import LoadBalancer
from concurry.core.worker.proxy import WorkerProxy

class WorkerPool(Typed):
    balancer: LoadBalancer
    workers: List[WorkerProxy]
```

✅ Also good (string annotation when the type is defined later in the same file):
```python
class WorkerPool(Typed):
    balancer: "LoadBalancer"
```

**If adding the import creates a circular dependency, that is a bug in the module structure.** Fix the structure (extract the shared type into a leaf module) instead of papering over it with `Any`.

### Scrutinize Every `Optional` and `Union` (CRITICAL)

**`Optional` is the second most common way LLMs degrade your type system, after `Any`.** When an LLM declares a value as `Optional[X]`, it is saying "this can be `None`." That claim must be justified. LLMs add `Optional` reflexively as a defensive measure — it silences type errors by broadening the type instead of fixing the root cause. The result is an `Optional` cascade: once a function returns `Optional[X]`, every caller must handle `None`, which means either (a) cluttering every call site with `if result is None` guards, or (b) ignoring the `None` case, which blows up at runtime.

**The rule is simple:** when you see `Optional[X]`, ask: **"Can this genuinely be `None` at runtime, and why?"** If the answer is "no" or "only during initialization before a lifecycle hook sets it," remove the `Optional` and fix the initialization so the value is always present after construction.

**Never let the LLM broaden a type signature to fix a bug.** When debugging, LLMs frequently propose changing `X` to `Optional[X]` or `Union[X, Y]` to make a type error go away. This hides the bug instead of fixing it. The correct response is to trace *why* the value is `None` and fix the code path that produces it.

**Use `@overload` with `Literal` when return type depends on input values.** When a function's return type varies based on a parameter (e.g., a `mode` string, a boolean flag), define `@overload` signatures so the type checker can narrow the return type at each call site. This eliminates unnecessary `Union` return types and removes the need for `isinstance` checks or `cast()` at call sites.

#### Anti-Pattern: `ClassVar` Default + `Optional` Field + `pre_initialize` Fallback

A particularly insidious form of unnecessary `Optional` occurs with `Typed + Registry` hierarchies: a base class declares a `ClassVar` with a default, an `Optional` instance field, and a `pre_initialize` hook that copies the `ClassVar` into the field when it is `None`. This makes the field `Optional` for no reason — the value is *always* set after construction, but the type system does not know that. Every consumer of the field must handle `None` even though `None` is impossible after initialization.

The fix: make the instance field **mandatory (no default)** on the base class. Subclasses override it with their own default. This forces every concrete subclass to declare a value, and the type checker knows the field is never `None`.

❌ Bad (ClassVar default + Optional field + pre_initialize fallback):
```python
class BaseHandler(Typed, Registry):
    _default_timeout: ClassVar[float] = 30.0                # ClassVar: invisible to Pydantic
    timeout: Optional[float] = None                         # Optional: pollutes every consumer

    @classmethod
    def pre_initialize(cls, data: Dict[str, Any]) -> None:
        if data.get("timeout") is None:
            data["timeout"] = cls._default_timeout          # Fallback: makes Optional "work"

class HttpHandler(BaseHandler):
    _default_timeout: ClassVar[float] = 10.0                # Overrides ClassVar, but still Optional
```

**Why this is bad:**

1. `timeout` is typed `Optional[float]`, so every method that uses `self.timeout` must handle `None` — even though `pre_initialize` guarantees it is never `None` after construction. The type system does not see `pre_initialize`; it sees `Optional[float]`.
2. The `ClassVar` `_default_timeout` is invisible to Pydantic serialization (`model_dump()` excludes ClassVars) and to IDE autocomplete on instances. It exists only to service the `pre_initialize` fallback.
3. A new `BaseHandler` subclass that forgets to set `_default_timeout` silently inherits `30.0` from the base class. There is no error, no warning — just a silent default that may be wrong.

✅ Good (mandatory field on base, subclass defaults):
```python
class BaseHandler(Typed, Registry):
    timeout: float                                          # Mandatory: no default on base

class HttpHandler(BaseHandler):
    timeout: float = 10.0                                   # Subclass provides its default

class GrpcHandler(BaseHandler):
    timeout: float = 30.0                                   # Different subclass, different default

class CustomHandler(BaseHandler):
    timeout: float                                          # No default → caller MUST pass it
    # CustomHandler()  → ValidationError: timeout is required
    # CustomHandler(timeout=5.0)  → works
```

**Why this is better:**

1. `timeout` is typed `float`, not `Optional[float]`. Every consumer knows it is always present. No `None` guards needed.
2. No `ClassVar`, no `pre_initialize` fallback, no hidden indirection.
3. A new subclass that forgets to set `timeout` **fails at construction time** — Pydantic raises `ValidationError: timeout is required`. This early failure is exactly what fail-fast demands.
4. A subclass that intentionally has no default forces the caller to pass `timeout` explicitly, which is correct when the right value depends on context.

**General principle:** When a `Typed + Registry` hierarchy has a field where different subclasses need different defaults, make the field **mandatory on the base class** and **override the default on each subclass**. Do NOT use `ClassVar` + `Optional` + `pre_initialize` — that pattern exists only to avoid making the field mandatory, and the cost is `Optional` pollution across the entire codebase.

### Type-Annotate All Intermediate Variables (CRITICAL)

**Every local variable MUST have a type annotation the first time it is assigned.** If the variable later changes type (which should be rare), annotate the re-assignment. This applies even when the type is "obvious" from the right-hand side.

**Why this matters:**

1. **Readability.** A reader scanning a 200-line function can see `futures: List[Future] = []` and immediately know the shape. Without the annotation, they must trace through the loop body to figure out what gets put into `futures`.
2. **Refactoring safety.** When you change the return type of a called function, annotated variables produce immediate type errors at every downstream usage. Unannotated variables silently propagate the wrong type.
3. **LLM code generation.** When an LLM reads your function to extend it, explicit types on every variable tell it exactly what data is available. Without annotations, it guesses — and guesses wrong.

❌ Bad (no annotations on intermediates):
```python
workers = [self._create_worker(i) for i in range(count)]
results = {}
pending = set()

for future in completed:
    result = future.result()
```

✅ Good (every variable annotated at first assignment):
```python
workers: List[WorkerProxy] = [self._create_worker(i) for i in range(count)]
results: Dict[str, Result] = {}
pending: Set[Future] = set()

for future in completed:
    result: Result = future.result()
```

**Loop variables** in `for` loops should be annotated when the iterable's element type is not obvious:

```python
# Obvious (iterating a List[WorkerProxy]) — annotation optional but encouraged:
for worker in self._workers:
    ...

# Not obvious (iterating dict items, zip, enumerate) — annotation required:
for worker_id, proxy in self._proxy_map.items():
    worker_id: str
    proxy: WorkerProxy
    ...
```

**This rule has no exceptions.** Annotate every intermediate variable. The cost is a few extra characters per line. The benefit is that every function reads like a specification of the data flowing through it.

❌ Bad (lowercase generics, pipe unions):
```python
def process(items: list[str], config: dict[str, int] | None = None) -> str | None:
    pass
```

✅ Good (capitalized typing imports):
```python
from typing import List, Dict, Optional

def process(items: List[str], config: Optional[Dict[str, int]] = None) -> Optional[str]:
    pass
```

❌ Bad (NoReturn misuse):
```python
from typing import NoReturn

def on_start(self) -> NoReturn:  # ❌ This function returns normally!
    self._setup_resources()
```

✅ Good:
```python
def on_start(self) -> None:  # Returns normally, no value
    self._setup_resources()

def fatal_error(msg: str) -> NoReturn:  # Genuinely never returns
    raise RuntimeError(msg)
```
