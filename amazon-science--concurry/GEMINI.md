# Cursor Rules: Concurry Architecture

## Synchronization Architecture and Rules

**CRITICAL**: Follow these rules when working with `wait()`, `gather()`, or future implementations.

For comprehensive architecture details, see [docs/architecture/synchronization.md](../../docs/architecture/synchronization.md)

### BaseFuture Implementations

**Rule 1**: Each future type has a specific state management strategy:
- `SyncFuture`: Caches everything (immutable at creation)
- `ConcurrentFuture`: Pure delegation wrapper (NO caching of `_result`, `_exception`, `_done`, `_cancelled`)
- `AsyncioFuture`: Pure delegation wrapper (NO caching of `_result`, `_exception`, `_done`)
- `RayFuture`: Caches state after fetching (stores `_result`, `_exception`, `_done`, `_cancelled`)

**Rule 2**: NEVER set `_done=True` without fetching the result:
```python
# ❌ WRONG - RayFuture bug
def done(self) -> bool:
    ready, _ = ray.wait([self._object_ref], timeout=0)
    if len(ready) > 0:
        self._done = True  # ❌ BUG: _result is still None!
        return True

# ✅ CORRECT
def done(self) -> bool:
    if self._done:
        return True
    ready, _ = ray.wait([self._object_ref], timeout=0)
    return len(ready) > 0  # Don't set _done here
```

**Rule 3**: All futures must raise consistent exception types:
- Raise `concurrent.futures.CancelledError`, NOT `asyncio.CancelledError`
- Raise `TimeoutError`, NOT `ray.exceptions.GetTimeoutError`

**Rule 4**: Callbacks must receive the wrapper (BaseFuture), not the underlying future:
```python
# ✅ CORRECT
def add_done_callback(self, fn: Callable) -> None:
    self._future.add_done_callback(lambda _: fn(self))  # Pass self, not _
```

**Rule 5**: Always use `wrap_future()` when accepting external futures:
```python
# ✅ CORRECT
from concurry.core.future import wrap_future

futures_list = [wrap_future(f) for f in external_futures]
```

### wait() and gather() Functions

**Rule 6**: Cannot mix structure and variadic arguments:
```python
# ❌ WRONG
futures = [f1, f2, f3]
wait(futures, f4, f5)  # Raises ValueError

# ✅ CORRECT
wait([f1, f2, f3, f4, f5])  # Pass as list
wait(f1, f2, f3, f4, f5)     # Pass individually
```

**Rule 7**: Dict inputs must return dicts with preserved keys:
```python
tasks = {"task1": f1, "task2": f2}
results = gather(tasks)
# Must return: {"task1": r1, "task2": r2}
```

**Rule 8**: Always call `fut.result(timeout=0)` after `wait()` completes:
```python
# ✅ CORRECT
done, not_done = wait(futures_list, ...)
for fut in done:
    result = fut.result(timeout=0)  # timeout=0 is safe, future is done
```

**Rule 9**: Ray batch checking must use single `ray.wait()` call:
```python
# ✅ CORRECT - batch all Ray futures
ready, not_ready = ray.wait(
    ray_futures, 
    num_returns=len(ray_futures),  # Check all at once
    timeout=0
)
```

### Polling Strategies

**Rule 10**: All polling intervals must come from `global_config`:
```python
# ❌ WRONG
strategy = FixedPollingStrategy(interval=0.01)  # Hardcoded!

# ✅ CORRECT
from concurry.config import global_config
defaults = global_config.defaults
strategy = FixedPollingStrategy(interval=defaults.polling_fixed_interval)
```

**Rule 11**: New polling strategies must inherit from `BasePollingStrategy`:
```python
class CustomStrategy(BasePollingStrategy):
    aliases = ["custom", PollingAlgorithm.Custom]
    
    def get_next_interval(self) -> float: ...
    def record_completion(self) -> None: ...
    def record_no_completion(self) -> None: ...
    def reset(self) -> None: ...
```

### Extension Guidelines

**Adding New Future Type**:
1. Inherit from `BaseFuture` and implement all abstract methods
2. Define `__slots__` with minimal fields (delegate when possible)
3. Use `FUTURE_UUID_PREFIX` class variable
4. Update `wrap_future()` function to detect new type
5. Update `_check_futures_batch()` for batch optimization (if applicable)

**Adding New Polling Strategy**:
1. Inherit from `BasePollingStrategy` (Registry + MutableTyped)
2. Define `aliases` for factory creation
3. Add to `PollingAlgorithm` enum
4. Add configuration defaults to `GlobalDefaults`
5. Update strategy creation in `wait()` and `gather()`

## Core Design Principle: No Silent Fallbacks

**CRITICAL**: Concurry must **fail noisily** rather than silently degrade performance.

### The Rule

❌ **NEVER** auto-fallback to slower implementations when configured implementation fails
✅ **ALWAYS** fail loudly with actionable error messages
✅ **DO** have multiple implementations (flexibility is good)
✅ **DO** select implementation via explicit configuration
❌ **DON'T** downgrade silently (causes mysterious slowdowns)

### Why This Matters

Silent fallbacks are the **bane of concurrency frameworks**. They cause:
- **Mysterious slowdowns** that are hard to diagnose
- **Production surprises** when code suddenly runs 10-100x slower
- **False confidence** in development that breaks in production
- **Debugging nightmares** trying to find why "the same code" performs differently

### Real-World Example

```python
# ❌ WRONG: Silent fallback
try:
    return RaySharedLimitSet(...)
except RayNotAvailableError:
    # Silently use slower implementation
    return InMemorySharedLimitSet(...)  # User thinks they have distributed limits!

# ✅ RIGHT: Noisy failure
if mode == "ray" and not ray.is_initialized():
    raise RuntimeError(
        "Ray mode selected but Ray is not initialized. "
        "Call ray.init() before creating workers, or use mode='thread'."
    )
```

### Implementation Guidelines

1. **Configuration is a contract** - If user specifies `mode="ray"`, they expect Ray
2. **Fail at initialization** - Check requirements during `.init()`, not during execution
3. **Clear error messages** - Tell user exactly what's wrong and how to fix it
4. **No implicit downgrades** - Don't automatically use slower implementation
5. **Document requirements** - Each mode's dependencies must be clear

### When to Apply This

- ✅ Execution mode selection (thread vs process vs ray)
- ✅ Limit backend selection (InMemory vs Multiprocess vs Ray)
- ✅ Feature availability checks (Ray not installed, dependencies missing)
- ✅ Resource requirements (not enough CPU cores, memory constraints)

### Exception: Performance-Neutral Edge Cases

The ONLY acceptable "fallback" is when it's **semantically equivalent and performance-neutral**:

```python
# OK: Not really a fallback, just edge case handling
if len(my_list) == 0:
    return default_value
```

This is fine because there's **no performance implication** - it's just handling an edge case.

## Worker and Worker Pool Architecture and Rules

For comprehensive architecture details, see [docs/architecture/workers.md](../../docs/architecture/workers.md)

### Worker Base Class

**RULE**: Worker class does NOT inherit from Typed (allows flexible `__init__` signatures).

- User-defined workers have complete freedom in `__init__` signature
- ✅ Supports cooperative multiple inheritance with Typed/BaseModel (ALL modes including Ray)
- ✅ Validation decorators (`@validate`, `@validate_call`) work with ALL modes including Ray
- ✅ **DO**: Use Typed/BaseModel inheritance - automatic composition wrapper enables Ray compatibility
- ✅ **DO**: Use decorators (@validate, @validate_call) for validation without inheritance
- ✅ **DO**: Use plain Python classes when validation not needed

**Automatic Ray Compatibility**:

Typed/BaseModel workers are automatically wrapped with composition pattern for Ray mode:

```python
# ✅ WORKS - Automatic composition wrapper for Ray
class MyWorker(Worker, Typed):
    name: str
    
    def process(self) -> str:
        return f"Processing {self.name}"

# This now works seamlessly with Ray mode - no code changes needed!
worker = MyWorker.options(mode="ray").init(name="test")
result = worker.process().result()  # "Processing test"

# ✅ Also works - Validation decorators
class MyWorker(Worker):
    @validate
    def __init__(self, name: str):
        self.name = name
```

The composition wrapper is applied transparently - you don't need to do anything special!

### WorkerProxy Hierarchy

**RULE**: All WorkerProxy classes inherit from `WorkerProxy(Typed, ABC)`.

- Each proxy sets `mode: ClassVar[ExecutionMode]` at class level (NOT passed as parameter)
- Public configuration fields are immutable and validated by Pydantic
- Private attributes use `PrivateAttr()`, initialized in `post_initialize()`
- Must implement abstract method: `_execute_method(method_name, *args, **kwargs) -> BaseFuture`
- ✅ **DO**: Use `ClassVar` for mode attribute
- ✅ **DO**: Initialize private attrs in `post_initialize()` with `object.__setattr__()`
- ✅ **DO**: Cache method wrappers in `_method_cache`
- ❌ **DON'T**: Pass mode as constructor parameter
- ❌ **DON'T**: Put synchronization primitives in public fields

**Proxy Types**:
- `SyncWorkerProxy`: Direct execution, `SyncFuture`, no queues
- `ThreadWorkerProxy`: Thread + command queue, `ConcurrentFuture`
- `ProcessWorkerProxy`: Process + 2 queues + result thread, `ConcurrentFuture`
- `AsyncioWorkerProxy`: Event loop thread + sync thread, `ConcurrentFuture`
- `RayWorkerProxy`: Ray actor, `RayFuture`, zero-copy ObjectRef

### WorkerProxyPool Hierarchy

**RULE**: All WorkerProxyPool classes inherit from `WorkerProxyPool(Typed, ABC)`.

- Pool is client-side, manages remote workers (not a remote actor itself)
- Must implement: `_initialize_pool()`, `_create_worker(worker_index)`, `_get_on_demand_limit()`
- Load balancer selects worker index, tracks active/total calls
- Each worker has independent submission semaphore (`max_queued_tasks`)
- All workers share same LimitSet instances (via LimitPool)
- Worker indices sequential (0, 1, 2, ...) for round-robin in LimitPool
- ✅ **DO**: Create workers with sequential indices
- ✅ **DO**: Pass `worker_index` to `_transform_worker_limits()`
- ✅ **DO**: Use load balancer to select worker
- ✅ **DO**: Wrap futures to release semaphore and record completion
- ❌ **DON'T**: Share LimitPool across workers (each gets own copy with unique index)
- ❌ **DON'T**: Hold semaphore during method execution (wrap future for release)

**Pool Types**:
- `InMemoryWorkerProxyPool`: Sync, Thread, Asyncio workers
- `MultiprocessWorkerProxyPool`: Process workers
- `RayWorkerProxyPool`: Ray workers

### WorkerBuilder

**RULE**: WorkerBuilder is the factory that creates workers or pools.

- Validates configuration (max_workers, on_demand compatibility)
- Applies defaults from global config
- Processes limits parameter (creates LimitPool)
- Creates retry config if num_retries > 0
- Applies composition wrapper for Typed/BaseModel workers (all modes)
- Decides single worker vs pool via `_should_create_pool()`
- ✅ **DO**: Process limits with `_transform_worker_limits()`
- ✅ **DO**: Create retry config from builder params
- ✅ **DO**: Apply composition wrapper for Typed/BaseModel workers
- ❌ **DON'T**: Create proxy directly (always use builder)

### Worker Wrapping

**RULE**: `_create_worker_wrapper()` injects limits and retry logic.

- Always sets `self.limits` (even if empty LimitPool)
- Uses `object.__setattr__()` to bypass frozen Pydantic models
- For Ray: Pre-wraps methods at class level (Ray bypasses `__getattribute__`)
- For other modes: Wraps methods dynamically via `__getattribute__`
- ✅ **DO**: Create LimitPool from list of Limits inside wrapper `__init__`
- ✅ **DO**: Use `object.__setattr__()` to set limits attribute
- ✅ **DO**: Pass `for_ray=True` when creating Ray worker wrapper
- ❌ **DON'T**: Serialize threading.Lock or similar primitives

### Submission Queue

**RULE**: Client-side semaphore limits in-flight tasks per worker (`max_queued_tasks`).

- Prevents memory exhaustion from thousands of pending futures
- Acquired in `__getattr__` BEFORE stopped check (atomic with execution)
- Released via future callback when task completes
- Bypassed for: Sync mode, Asyncio mode, blocking mode, on-demand workers
- ✅ **DO**: Acquire semaphore before checking stopped flag
- ✅ **DO**: Wrap future to release semaphore on completion
- ✅ **DO**: Bypass for modes that don't need it
- ❌ **DON'T**: Hold semaphore during user code execution

### Future Unwrapping

**RULE**: Automatically unwrap BaseFuture arguments (unless `unwrap_futures=False`).

- Fast-path: Check if any futures/collections present before unwrapping
- Recursively unwrap using `morphic.map_collection`
- Ray optimization: Extract ObjectRef from RayFuture (zero-copy)
- ✅ **DO**: Use fast-path to avoid expensive unwrapping
- ✅ **DO**: For Ray, return `obj._object_ref` for RayFuture
- ✅ **DO**: Resolve nested ObjectRefs (Ray limitation workaround)
- ❌ **DON'T**: Unwrap when `unwrap_futures=False`

### Load Balancing

**RULE**: Load balancer tracks per-worker statistics with thread-safe access.

- All state modifications under lock
- `select_worker(num_workers)`: Returns worker index
- `record_start(worker_id)`: Called when task dispatched
- `record_complete(worker_id)`: Called when task finishes (via future callback)
- ✅ **DO**: Hold lock only during state updates
- ✅ **DO**: Use callback to record completion
- ❌ **DON'T**: Hold lock during task execution
- ❌ **DON'T**: Call `record_complete()` before submitting future

**Algorithms**:
- `RoundRobin`: Even distribution (default for persistent pools)
- `LeastActiveLoad`: Fewest active calls
- `LeastTotalLoad`: Fewest total calls
- `Random`: Random selection (default for on-demand pools)

### On-Demand Workers

**RULE**: On-demand workers created per request, destroyed after completion.

- Concurrency limits: Thread/Process = `max(1, cpu_count()-1)`, Ray = unlimited
- Cleanup in separate thread to avoid deadlock
- Don't share limits across on-demand workers (each gets own copy)
- ✅ **DO**: Schedule cleanup in separate thread
- ✅ **DO**: Track in `_on_demand_workers` list with lock
- ✅ **DO**: Use `_wait_for_on_demand_slot()` to enforce concurrency limit
- ❌ **DON'T**: Call `worker.stop()` directly from callback
- ❌ **DON'T**: Use limits with on-demand workers (not shared)

### Shared Limits Across Pool

For comprehensive architecture details, see [docs/architecture/limits.md](../../docs/architecture/limits.md)

**RULE**: All workers in pool share same LimitSet instances.

- Builder creates shared LimitSet with `is_pool=True`
- Each worker gets LimitPool with same LimitSet instances
- Worker index used for round-robin offset in LimitPool
- ✅ **DO**: Create shared LimitSet at pool level
- ✅ **DO**: Pass unique worker_index to each worker
- ✅ **DO**: Each worker gets own LimitPool (NOT shared)
- ❌ **DON'T**: Create separate LimitSets per worker
- ❌ **DON'T**: Share LimitPool across workers

### Mode-Specific Rules

**Sync**:
- Direct execution in current thread
- Async functions via `asyncio.run()` (blocks)
- No threads, no queues, zero overhead

**Thread**:
- Command queue + worker thread
- Async functions via `asyncio.run()` in worker thread (no concurrency)
- Queue timeout via `command_queue_timeout`

**Process**:
- Two queues (command + result) + worker process + result thread
- Worker class, init args/kwargs, retry config serialized with `cloudpickle`
- Async functions via `asyncio.run()` in worker process (no concurrency)
- Exception types preserved across process boundary
- **CRITICAL**: Use `forkserver` context (safe with gRPC threads), NOT `fork` (causes segfaults with Ray client)

**Asyncio**:
- Event loop thread (async methods) + sync thread (sync methods)
- True async concurrency in event loop
- 10-50x speedup for concurrent I/O operations
- ~13% overhead for sync methods vs Thread

**Ray**:
- Ray actor (distributed process)
- RayFuture wraps ObjectRef
- Zero-copy: RayFuture → ObjectRef passed directly
- Native async support (Ray handles automatically)
- Retry logic pre-applied at class level (bypasses `__getattribute__`)
- ✅ Compatible with Typed/BaseModel via automatic composition wrapper
- **CRITICAL**: Actors execute methods serially by default (one at a time)
- For N concurrent tasks, need N separate actors (not N tasks on 1 actor)

### Process Mode Serialization Rules

**RULE**: Use `cloudpickle` for ALL user-provided objects, standard pickle for infrastructure.

**Why Cloudpickle:**
- Users define functions/classes in Jupyter notebooks (local scope)
- Standard `pickle` cannot serialize local functions, lambdas, or `__main__` modules
- Common workflow: define worker/function in notebook, use process mode for CPU tasks
- ✅ **DO**: Use `cloudpickle` for: worker_cls, init_args, init_kwargs, retry_config
- ❌ **DON'T**: Use cloudpickle for: Queues, Locks, Manager proxies (breaks multiprocessing)

**RULE**: Manager and workers MUST use same multiprocessing context.

**Why Same Context:**
- Manager proxies use custom `__reduce__` for pickling
- Proxy pickling requires same context (fork/spawn/forkserver) on both ends
- Mixing contexts causes `TypeError: cannot pickle 'weakref.ReferenceType' object`
- ✅ **DO**: Create Manager with same context as workers (both use forkserver by default)
- ❌ **DON'T**: Create Manager with spawn, workers with forkserver (FAILS)

**RULE**: Default to `forkserver` context, NOT `fork` or `spawn`.

**Why Forkserver:**
- `fork` (default on Unix): UNSAFE with active threads (Ray client gRPC), causes segfaults
- `spawn`: SAFE but SLOW (~10-20s per worker startup on Linux)
- `forkserver`: SAFE and FAST (~200ms startup), best balance
- ✅ **DO**: Use `forkserver` from `global_config.defaults.mp_context`
- ✅ **DO**: Allow override via `Worker.options(mp_context="spawn")` if needed
- ❌ **DON'T**: Use `fork` when Ray client may be active (common workflow)

**Historical Context (October 2025):**
1. **Attempt 1**: Use `fork` - FAILED (segfaults with Ray client mode)
2. **Attempt 2**: Use `spawn` for everything - FAILED (10-20s startup, unusable)
3. **Attempt 3**: Use `spawn` for Manager, `forkserver` for workers - FAILED (pickling errors)
4. **Final Solution**: Use `forkserver` for both + cloudpickle for user objects - SUCCESS

### Adding New Worker Types

**Steps**:
1. Create `NewModeWorkerProxy(WorkerProxy)` with `mode: ClassVar`
2. Implement `_execute_method()` returning appropriate BaseFuture subclass
3. Create `NewModeFuture(BaseFuture)` with `FUTURE_UUID_PREFIX`
4. Create `NewModeWorkerProxyPool(WorkerProxyPool)` if pools supported
5. Add to `ExecutionMode` enum
6. Update `WorkerBuilder._create_single_worker()` and `_create_pool()`
7. Update `wrap_future()` to detect new future type
8. Add configuration defaults to `GlobalDefaults`
9. Write comprehensive tests

### Critical Gotchas

1. **Ray + Pydantic/Typed**: ✅ Fully supported via automatic composition wrapper (no code changes needed)
2. **Async in non-Asyncio**: Works but no concurrency (sequential via `asyncio.run()`)
3. **Submission queue vs limits**: Two separate mechanisms (client-side vs worker-side)
4. **On-demand + limits**: Limits NOT shared (each worker gets own copy)
5. **Method caching**: `__getattr__` caches wrappers, can become stale for callable attributes
6. **Pool exceptions**: Don't stop pool, stored in futures
7. **Worker state in pools**: Per-worker state, NOT per-pool
8. **Stop timeout**: Per-operation, not total (N workers × timeout)
9. **Cloudpickle closures**: Capture outer scope, can serialize unexpected objects
10. **Load balancer reset**: State lost on pool restart
11. **Process mode + fork + Ray client**: UNSAFE - causes segfaults/deadlocks (use forkserver)
12. **Multiprocessing context mixing**: Manager and workers MUST use same context
13. **Standard pickle for local functions**: FAILS - use cloudpickle for all user objects
14. **Ray actor serial execution**: One method at a time by default (N actors needed for N concurrent tasks)

## Limit System Architecture and Rules

For comprehensive architecture details, see [docs/architecture/limits.md](../../docs/architecture/limits.md)

### Layer 1: Limit Classes (Data Containers)

**RULE**: Limit objects are **NOT thread-safe** and must never be used directly for synchronization.

- `Limit`, `RateLimit`, `CallLimit`, `ResourceLimit` are pure data containers
- No internal locking or thread-safety
- All state (`_impl`, `_current_usage`) is unprotected
- `can_acquire()` is NOT thread-safe
- ✅ **DO**: Use within LimitSet for thread-safe operations
- ❌ **DON'T**: Call `limit.can_acquire()` from multiple threads
- ❌ **DON'T**: Add locks or synchronization to Limit classes

### Layer 2: LimitSet (Thread-Safe Executor)

**RULE**: `LimitSet` is a factory function that returns appropriate backend implementation. All thread-safety happens here.

- Returns `InMemorySharedLimitSet`, `MultiprocessSharedLimitSet`, or `RaySharedLimitSet`
- Always use `LimitSet()` factory, never instantiate backends directly
- All acquisition/release must happen through LimitSet methods
- Lock granularity: Hold lock only during check + acquire and release
- ✅ **DO**: Use `with limitset.acquire()` for all acquisitions
- ✅ **DO**: Make `LimitSetAcquisition.__enter__` / `__exit__` the only acquisition/release entry points
- ❌ **DON'T**: Hold lock during user code execution
- ❌ **DON'T**: Call `limit.can_acquire()` directly from LimitSet - always under lock

**RULE**: Multiprocess and Ray backends must use centralized shared state, NOT local Limit object state.

- `MultiprocessSharedLimitSet`: Use `Manager.dict()` for all limit state
- `RaySharedLimitSet`: Use `LimitTrackerActor` for all limit state
- Override `_can_acquire_all()` to check shared state, not `limit.can_acquire()`
- Local Limit objects are COPIES after pickling, not shared
- ✅ **DO**: Check `self._resource_state` / `self._rate_limit_state` in `_can_acquire_all()`
- ❌ **DON'T**: Trust `limit._current_usage` or `limit._impl` state in multiprocess/Ray

### Layer 3: LimitPool (Load-Balanced Wrapper)

**RULE**: `LimitPool` is **private** to each worker (NOT shared). LimitSets within pool ARE shared.

- Each worker gets own `LimitPool` instance
- No cross-worker synchronization in LimitPool (fast, scalable)
- LimitSets within pool are shared (coordinated limiting)
- Must be `morphic.Typed` subclass (immutable public attributes)
- ✅ **DO**: Create one LimitPool per worker with unique `worker_index`
- ✅ **DO**: Use `PrivateAttr` for `_balancer`
- ❌ **DON'T**: Share LimitPool across workers
- ❌ **DON'T**: Add synchronization primitives to LimitPool

**RULE**: LimitPool must support serialization for Ray/Process workers.

- Implement `__getstate__` to exclude `_balancer` (contains lock)
- Implement `__setstate__` to recreate `_balancer` from config
- Store only serializable state in public attributes
- ✅ **DO**: Exclude non-serializable state in `__getstate__`
- ✅ **DO**: Recreate non-serializable state in `__setstate__`
- ❌ **DON'T**: Store `threading.Lock` or other non-picklable objects in public attributes

**RULE**: LimitPool does NOT support string key indexing.

- Only integer indexing: `pool[0]` returns LimitSet
- String keys ambiguous when LimitSets have different keys
- ✅ **DO**: Use `pool[index]["key"]` to get Limit from specific LimitSet
- ❌ **DON'T**: Implement `__getitem__` for string keys
- ❌ **DON'T**: Assume all LimitSets have same keys

### Worker Integration

**RULE**: Workers **always** have `self.limits` available, even without configuration.

- `limits=None` → Empty LimitPool with empty LimitSet
- Always wrap in LimitPool (unified interface)
- For Ray/Process single workers: Pass `List[Limit]`, wrap inside actor/process
- For pools: Pass LimitSet/List[LimitSet], wrap in LimitPool with unique `worker_index` per worker
- ✅ **DO**: Use `_transform_worker_limits()` to normalize all inputs to LimitPool
- ✅ **DO**: Create empty LimitPool for `limits=None`
- ❌ **DON'T**: Set `self.limits = None` on workers
- ❌ **DON'T**: Assume `self.limits` can be None

**RULE**: Worker pools must assign unique `worker_index` to each worker's LimitPool.

- Enables round-robin offset for load distribution
- Worker N gets `worker_index=N`
- On-demand workers use incrementing counter for indices
- ✅ **DO**: Pass `worker_index` to `_transform_worker_limits()` for each worker
- ✅ **DO**: Use `_on_demand_counter` for on-demand worker indices
- ❌ **DON'T**: Reuse same `worker_index` for multiple workers in a pool

**RULE**: Mode compatibility must be validated when passing LimitSet to Worker.

- `InMemorySharedLimitSet` only with `sync`, `thread`, `asyncio` workers
- `MultiprocessSharedLimitSet` only with `process` workers
- `RaySharedLimitSet` only with `ray` workers
- ✅ **DO**: Call `_validate_mode_compatibility()` in `_transform_worker_limits()`
- ✅ **DO**: Raise clear ValueError for incompatible modes
- ❌ **DON'T**: Allow mode mismatches (will cause runtime failures)

### Acquisition Flow Rules

**RULE**: Config must be copied during acquisition to prevent mutations.

- `LimitSetAcquisition.__init__`: `self.config = dict(config) if config else {}`
- Prevents user code from mutating LimitSet's config
- ✅ **DO**: Copy config dict in `LimitSetAcquisition.__init__`
- ❌ **DON'T**: Store reference to LimitSet's config dict

**RULE**: RateLimits must be updated before context exit. CallLimit/ResourceLimit must NOT be updated.

- `LimitSetAcquisition.__exit__`: Validate all RateLimits updated
- Raise `RuntimeError` if any RateLimit not updated
- CallLimit: usage always 1, no update needed
- ResourceLimit: acquired = used, no update needed
- ✅ **DO**: Track `_updated_keys` in `LimitSetAcquisition.update()`
- ✅ **DO**: Validate all RateLimits in `_updated_keys` before release
- ❌ **DON'T**: Require update for CallLimit or ResourceLimit

**RULE**: Atomic multi-limit acquisition must hold lock for entire check + acquire operation.

- Prevents TOCTOU (Time-Of-Check-Time-Of-Use) races
- Check `_can_acquire_all()` and `_acquire_all()` under same lock hold
- Brief lock hold (microseconds) - acceptable
- ✅ **DO**: Wrap check + acquire in single `with self._lock`
- ❌ **DON'T**: Release lock between check and acquire
- ❌ **DON'T**: Hold lock during user code execution

### Partial Acquisition Rules

**RULE**: CallLimit and ResourceLimit are automatically included with default=1 when not specified in `requested`.

- Empty `requested` → Acquire ALL limits (RateLimits must raise ValueError)
- Non-empty `requested` → Acquire specified + auto-add CallLimit/ResourceLimit with default=1
- RateLimits NOT auto-added (must be explicit)
- ✅ **DO**: Auto-include CallLimit/ResourceLimit in `_build_requested_amounts()`
- ✅ **DO**: Raise ValueError if RateLimit not specified when acquiring all
- ❌ **DON'T**: Auto-include unspecified RateLimits

### Extension Rules

**RULE**: New Limit types must update both base and backend-specific implementations.

When adding new Limit type:
1. Subclass `Limit`, implement abstract methods
2. Update `BaseLimitSet._acquire_all()` with new limit type case
3. Update `BaseLimitSet._release_acquisitions()` with new limit type case
4. Update `MultiprocessSharedLimitSet._can_acquire_all()` with shared state handling
5. Update `RaySharedLimitSet` / `LimitTrackerActor` with centralized state handling

**RULE**: New load balancing algorithms must handle serialization for Ray/Process.

When adding new algorithm:
1. Add to `LoadBalancingAlgorithm` enum
2. Create balancer class inheriting from `BaseLoadBalancer`
3. Update `LimitPool.post_initialize()` to instantiate new balancer
4. If balancer has non-serializable state, update `LimitPool.__getstate__` / `__setstate__`

**RULE**: New LimitSet backends must handle shared state correctly for their execution mode.

When adding new backend:
1. Subclass `BaseLimitSet`
2. Implement all abstract methods (`acquire`, `try_acquire`, `release_limit_set_acquisition`, etc.)
3. If state not naturally shared: Override `_can_acquire_all()` to use shared state source
4. Update `LimitSet` factory function to return new backend for specific mode
5. Update `_validate_mode_compatibility()` to handle new backend

### Code Quality Rules

**RULE**: Never bypass frozen model protection incorrectly.

- Use `object.__setattr__(self, "limits", limit_pool)` to set limits on frozen Typed/BaseModel workers
- This is safe because it's done once in `__init__`, not during concurrent execution
- ✅ **DO**: Use `object.__setattr__` in `_create_worker_wrapper()` to set `self.limits`
- ❌ **DON'T**: Use `object.__setattr__` for arbitrary attribute modifications
- ❌ **DON'T**: Modify frozen attributes after initialization

**RULE**: Follow explicit check patterns from Concurry coding standards.

- Use `len(collection) == 0` not `not collection`
- Use `value is None` not `not value`
- Always include type hints
- See main Concurry cursor rules for full coding standards

### Testing Rules

**RULE**: Test all execution modes for Limit features.

- Use `worker_mode` fixture for tests that work with all modes
- Use `pool_mode` or explicit skip for pool-specific tests
- Test `InMemorySharedLimitSet`, `MultiprocessSharedLimitSet`, and `RaySharedLimitSet`
- Test serialization for Ray/Process workers
- ✅ **DO**: Parametrize tests across all modes
- ✅ **DO**: Test mode compatibility validation
- ❌ **DON'T**: Test only one execution mode

**RULE**: Test both successful and failed acquisitions.

- Test `try_acquire()` success and failure paths
- Test timeout scenarios
- Test atomic rollback on partial failure
- Test RateLimit update validation
- ✅ **DO**: Test error paths (missing update, timeout, invalid usage)
- ✅ **DO**: Test acquisition rollback on partial failure
- ❌ **DON'T**: Only test happy paths

**RULE**: Ray shared limits tests must use N actors for N concurrent tasks.

**Why:**
- Ray actors execute methods serially (one at a time) by default
- 2 actors with 3 tasks each = max 2 concurrent tasks (NOT 6!)
- Tasks 2-3 are queued inside each actor, not executing
- To test capacity=3 limit, need at least 4+ separate actors

**Testing Pattern:**
```python
# ❌ WRONG: 2 actors, 6 tasks total = only 2 concurrent tasks
w1, w2 = [create_ray_worker() for _ in range(2)]
futures = []
for _ in range(3):
    futures.append(w1.task())  # Tasks queued in w1
    futures.append(w2.task())  # Tasks queued in w2
# Only 2 tasks run concurrently!

# ✅ CORRECT: 6 actors, 6 tasks total = 6 concurrent tasks
workers = [create_ray_worker() for _ in range(6)]
futures = [w.task() for w in workers]  # 6 concurrent tasks
```

- ✅ **DO**: Create N actors to test N-way concurrency
- ✅ **DO**: Submit one task per actor for concurrent execution
- ❌ **DON'T**: Submit multiple tasks to one actor (they're queued, not concurrent)

## Retry Architecture and Rules

For comprehensive architecture details, see [docs/architecture/retries.md](../../docs/architecture/retries.md)

**RULE**: ALL retry logic must execute actor-side (inside worker), NEVER client-side.

- Retry loops run in actor/process/thread context
- Avoids round-trip latency for each retry
- Only final result crosses process boundary
- ✅ **DO**: Apply retry in `execute_with_retry` / `execute_with_retry_async`
- ❌ **DON'T**: Implement retry logic in WorkerProxy or client-side code

**RULE**: Zero overhead when disabled: `num_retries=0` must have NO performance impact.

- Short-circuit in `_create_retry_config()`: Return `None` if `num_retries == 0`
- Short-circuit in `_create_worker_wrapper()`: Skip retry wrapping if config is `None`
- Short-circuit in `_execute_task()`: Direct execution if `num_retries == 0`
- ✅ **DO**: Check `num_retries > 0` before any retry logic
- ❌ **DON'T**: Create RetryConfig or wrapper overhead when retries disabled

### RetryConfig (Configuration Class)

**RULE**: RetryConfig is `morphic.Typed` (Pydantic-based) for validation, defaults from global_config.

- All fields default to `None`, resolved in `post_initialize()` from `global_config`
- Validation via `@field_validator` decorators
- Frozen after initialization (immutable public attributes)
- ✅ **DO**: Load defaults from `global_config.clone()` in `post_initialize()`
- ✅ **DO**: Use `object.__setattr__` to set defaults (frozen instance)
- ❌ **DON'T**: Hardcode default values in field definitions

**RULE**: `retry_on` must be list of exception classes or callables accepting `(exception, **context)`.

- Validator converts single item to list
- Exception classes must be `BaseException` subclasses
- Callables must return `bool`
- ✅ **DO**: Check both `isinstance(item, type)` and `callable(item)` in validator
- ❌ **DON'T**: Accept arbitrary objects

**RULE**: `retry_until` must be list of callables accepting `(result, **context)`.

- Validator converts single item to list
- All validators must return `True` for result to be valid (AND logic)
- ✅ **DO**: Pass result and full context to validators
- ❌ **DON'T**: Use OR logic (any validator passing)

### Retry Execution Functions

**RULE**: Provide THREE execution functions for different contexts.

1. `execute_with_retry(func, args, kwargs, config, context)` - Sync functions
2. `execute_with_retry_async(async_func, args, kwargs, config, context)` - Async functions
3. `execute_with_retry_auto(fn, args, kwargs, config, context)` - TaskWorker dispatcher

- `execute_with_retry_auto` detects function type and dispatches to appropriate function
- Use `inspect.iscoroutinefunction(fn)` for detection
- Use `asyncio.run()` to run async retry in sync contexts
- ✅ **DO**: Use `execute_with_retry_auto` ONLY in `_execute_task` (TaskWorker)
- ✅ **DO**: Use `execute_with_retry` for sync methods, `execute_with_retry_async` for async methods
- ❌ **DON'T**: Use `execute_with_retry_auto` in regular method wrappers (not needed)

**RULE**: Context dict must include all debugging information.

```python
context = {
    "method_name": str,        # Function/method name
    "worker_class": str,       # Worker class name or "TaskWorker"
    "attempt": int,            # Current attempt (1-indexed, updated in loop)
    "elapsed_time": float,     # Seconds since first attempt (updated in loop)
    "args": tuple,             # Original positional arguments
    "kwargs": dict,            # Original keyword arguments
}
```

- ✅ **DO**: Update `attempt` and `elapsed_time` each loop iteration
- ✅ **DO**: Pass context to filters, validators, and error messages
- ❌ **DON'T**: Omit any context fields

**RULE**: Retry loop must handle both exceptions and validation failures.

```python
for attempt in 1..max_attempts:
    try:
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        
        # Check validators if configured
        if config.retry_until:
            is_valid, error_msg = _validate_result(result, validators, context)
            if is_valid:
                return result
            else:
                collect_validation_error(error_msg)
                if last_attempt:
                    raise RetryValidationError(...)
                sleep_and_continue()
        else:
            return result
    
    except Exception as e:
        if not _should_retry_on_exception(e, filters, context):
            raise  # Not retriable
        if last_attempt:
            raise  # Exhausted retries
        sleep_and_continue()
```

- ✅ **DO**: Check validators even on successful execution
- ✅ **DO**: Collect all results and errors for `RetryValidationError`
- ❌ **DON'T**: Skip validation on intermediate attempts
- ❌ **DON'T**: Ignore exception filters

### Worker Method Wrapping

**RULE**: Use TWO different wrapping strategies based on execution mode.

1. **__getattribute__ Interception** (sync, thread, process, asyncio):
   - Wrap methods on first access
   - Mark with `__wrapped_with_retry__` flag to avoid double-wrapping
   - Only wrap public methods (no `_` prefix), callables, not classes

2. **Pre-Wrapped Methods** (Ray only):
   - Wrap methods at class level before `ray.remote()`
   - Iterate `worker_cls.__dict__` (only direct methods, not inherited)
   - Bind `self` at call time via `original_method.__get__(self, type(self))`

- ✅ **DO**: Use `for_ray` parameter to select strategy in `_create_worker_wrapper()`
- ✅ **DO**: Skip inherited methods in Ray pre-wrapping
- ❌ **DON'T**: Use `__getattribute__` for Ray (breaks signature inspection)
- ❌ **DON'T**: Wrap private methods or special methods

**RULE**: Preserve method attributes in wrappers.

```python
wrapped.__name__ = method.__name__
wrapped.__doc__ = method.__doc__
wrapped.__wrapped_with_retry__ = True  # Marker flag
```

- ✅ **DO**: Copy `__name__` and `__doc__` to wrapper
- ✅ **DO**: Set `__wrapped_with_retry__` marker for cache detection
- ❌ **DON'T**: Lose method metadata

### TaskWorker Integration

**RULE**: Apply retry in `_execute_task` method, NOT in `submit()`.

- `submit()` is public → would be wrapped by `__getattribute__` → double-wrapping
- `_execute_task()` is private → NOT wrapped by `__getattribute__` → single retry application
- ✅ **DO**: Check `self.retry_config is not None and num_retries > 0` in `_execute_task()`
- ✅ **DO**: Use `execute_with_retry_auto()` to handle both sync and async functions
- ❌ **DON'T**: Apply retry logic in `submit()` or `map()` methods

**RULE**: TaskWorker context must use "TaskWorker" as worker class name.

```python
context = {
    "method_name": fn.__name__ if hasattr(fn, "__name__") else "anonymous_function",
    "worker_class_name": "TaskWorker",  # Always "TaskWorker", not actual class
}
```

- ✅ **DO**: Use `"TaskWorker"` literal for `worker_class_name`
- ✅ **DO**: Handle anonymous functions gracefully
- ❌ **DON'T**: Use actual worker proxy class name

### Backoff Algorithms

**RULE**: Support three backoff algorithms with Full Jitter.

1. **Linear**: `wait = base_wait * attempt`
2. **Exponential** (default): `wait = base_wait * (2 ** (attempt - 1))`
3. **Fibonacci**: `wait = base_wait * fibonacci(attempt)`

**RULE**: Apply Full Jitter after backoff calculation.

```python
calculated_wait = algorithm(attempt, base_wait)

if config.retry_jitter > 0:
    wait = random.uniform(0, calculated_wait)  # Full Jitter
else:
    wait = calculated_wait

return max(0, wait)
```

- ✅ **DO**: Apply jitter AFTER algorithm calculation
- ✅ **DO**: Use `random.uniform(0, calculated_wait)` for Full Jitter
- ❌ **DON'T**: Use partial jitter or fixed jitter amounts
- ❌ **DON'T**: Allow negative wait times

**RULE**: Fibonacci sequence starts at 1: `[1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...]`.

```python
def _fibonacci(n: int) -> int:
    if n <= 2:
        return 1
    a, b = 1, 1
    for _ in range(n - 2):
        a, b = b, a + b
    return b
```

- ✅ **DO**: Return 1 for `n <= 2`
- ❌ **DON'T**: Start sequence at 0 or use different indexing

### Exception Filtering

**RULE**: Check all filters in order, return True on first match.

```python
def _should_retry_on_exception(exception, retry_on_filters, context):
    for filter_item in retry_on_filters:
        if isinstance(filter_item, type):
            # Exception class
            if isinstance(exception, filter_item):
                return True
        elif callable(filter_item):
            # Callable filter
            try:
                if filter_item(exception=exception, **context):
                    return True
            except Exception:
                continue  # If filter raises, skip it
    return False
```

- ✅ **DO**: Check both exception classes and callables
- ✅ **DO**: Catch and ignore exceptions from filters
- ❌ **DON'T**: Let filter exceptions propagate
- ❌ **DON'T**: Use AND logic (all filters must match)

### Output Validation

**RULE**: All validators must return True for result to be valid (AND logic).

```python
def _validate_result(result, validators, context):
    for validator in validators:
        try:
            if not validator(result=result, **context):
                return False, f"Validator '{validator.__name__}' returned False"
        except Exception as e:
            return False, f"Validator '{validator.__name__}' raised: {e}"
    return True, None
```

- ✅ **DO**: Require ALL validators to return True
- ✅ **DO**: Catch validator exceptions and treat as validation failure
- ✅ **DO**: Return descriptive error messages
- ❌ **DON'T**: Use OR logic (any validator passing)
- ❌ **DON'T**: Let validator exceptions propagate

### RetryValidationError

**RULE**: RetryValidationError must be pickleable for multiprocessing.

```python
class RetryValidationError(Exception):
    def __reduce__(self):
        """Support pickling for multiprocessing."""
        return (
            self.__class__,
            (self.attempts, self.all_results, self.validation_errors, self.method_name),
        )
```

- ✅ **DO**: Implement `__reduce__` for pickle support
- ✅ **DO**: Store all results and validation errors from all attempts
- ❌ **DON'T**: Omit any attributes from `__reduce__`
### Integration Rules

### Interaction with Limits

**RULE**: Retry and limits are independent but coordinated systems.

- Each retry is a complete new method invocation
- Limits acquired/released via context manager for each attempt
- Failed attempts release limits immediately (context manager `__exit__`)
- ✅ **DO**: Let user methods handle limit acquisition normally
- ✅ **DO**: Rely on context manager to release limits on exception
- ❌ **DON'T**: Manually manage limits in retry logic
- ❌ **DON'T**: Hold limits across retry sleep periods

**Flow**:
```
Retry Loop
  ↓
  User Method
    ↓
    with self.limits.acquire():  ← Acquire
      ... method body ...
      acq.update()
    ← Limits released (even on exception)
  ↓
  Check exception/validation
  ↓
  Sleep + retry if needed
```

### Serialization

**RULE**: Handle Ray and Process serialization requirements.

**For Process mode**:
- `RetryConfig`: Pickleable by default (Pydantic model)
- `RetryValidationError`: Implement `__reduce__`
- User functions: Must be pickleable

**For Ray mode**:
- Regular workers: `RetryConfig` passed during actor creation (no special handling)
- TaskWorker: Serialize `RetryConfig` with `cloudpickle` to avoid Pydantic lock issues

```python
# In ray_worker.py _execute_task for TaskWorker
retry_config_bytes = cloudpickle.dumps(self.retry_config)

def ray_retry_wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
    r_config = cloudpickle.loads(retry_config_bytes)
    return execute_with_retry_auto(fn, args, kwargs, r_config, context)
```

- ✅ **DO**: Use `cloudpickle.dumps/loads` for RetryConfig in Ray TaskWorker
- ❌ **DON'T**: Pass RetryConfig directly to Ray remote function for TaskWorker

### Extension Rules

### Adding New Retry Algorithms

1. Add to `RetryAlgorithm` enum in `constants.py`
2. Implement in `calculate_retry_wait()` in `retry.py`
3. Add default to `GlobalDefaults` in `config.py`
4. Jitter is applied AFTER algorithm calculation (don't modify jitter logic)

### Adding Context Fields

1. Add field to `context` dict in `execute_with_retry` / `execute_with_retry_async`
2. Update docstring to document new field
3. Pass to filters/validators via `**context`
4. Update architecture doc with new field

### Adding Validator/Filter Features

1. Ensure backward compatibility (new features should be optional)
2. Add validation in `RetryConfig` validators
3. Pass additional context via `context` dict
4. Document in RetryConfig docstring

# Quick References

### Quick Reference - Limits

| Concern | Responsibility | Thread-Safe? |
|---------|----------------|--------------|
| Define constraints | `Limit` (RateLimit, CallLimit, ResourceLimit) | ❌ NO |
| Acquire/release | `LimitSet` (factory → backend implementation) | ✅ YES |
| Load balancing | `LimitPool` (private per worker) | ❌ N/A (no sharing) |
| Worker integration | `_transform_worker_limits()`, `_create_worker_wrapper()` | ✅ YES (via LimitSet) |

| Backend | Mode | Synchronization | Shared State |
|---------|------|----------------|--------------|
| `InMemorySharedLimitSet` | sync, thread, asyncio | `threading.Lock` | Local objects (naturally shared) |
| `MultiprocessSharedLimitSet` | process | `Manager.Lock()` | `Manager.dict()` (centralized) |
| `RaySharedLimitSet` | ray | Ray actor | `LimitTrackerActor` (centralized) |

| Input | Transformation | Output |
|-------|---------------|--------|
| `None` | Create empty LimitSet | LimitPool([empty_limitset]) |
| `List[Limit]` | Create LimitSet | LimitPool([limitset]) |
| `LimitSet` | Wrap in LimitPool | LimitPool([limitset]) |
| `List[LimitSet]` | Aggregate in LimitPool | LimitPool(limitsets) |
| `LimitPool` | Pass through | LimitPool (unchanged) |

### Quick Reference - Retry mechanisms

| Component | Location | Purpose | Key Methods |
|-----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `RetryConfig` | `retry.py` | Configuration | `post_initialize()`, validators |
| `execute_with_retry` | `retry.py` | Sync retry loop | Main retry logic |
| `execute_with_retry_async` | `retry.py` | Async retry loop | Async retry logic |
| `execute_with_retry_auto` | `retry.py` | TaskWorker dispatcher | Sync/async detection |
| `_create_worker_wrapper` | `base_worker.py` | Method wrapping | Creates wrapper class |
| `create_retry_wrapper` | `retry.py` | Single method wrapper | Wraps one method |
| `calculate_retry_wait` | `retry.py` | Backoff + jitter | Returns wait time |
| `_should_retry_on_exception` | `retry.py` | Exception filtering | Returns bool |
| `_validate_result` | `retry.py` | Output validation | Returns (bool, error) |

| Execution Mode | Wrapping Strategy | TaskWorker Function |
|----------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| sync, thread, process, asyncio | `__getattribute__` | `execute_with_retry_auto` |
| ray | Pre-wrapped at class level | `cloudpickle` + `execute_with_retry_auto` |

| Algorithm | Formula | Example (base=1.0) |
|-----------|---------|-------------------|
| Linear | `base * attempt` | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ... |
| Exponential | `base * 2^(attempt-1)` | 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ... |
| Fibonacci | `base * fib(attempt)` | 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ... |

Then apply Full Jitter: `random.uniform(0, calculated_wait)`

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ Apply retry in `submit()` method (causes double-wrapping)
❌ Use closure capture for retry logic in process/ray modes
❌ Forget to set `num_retries > 0` in RetryConfig
❌ Set future timeout too short for retry delays
❌ Use `__getattribute__` for Ray workers (breaks signature)
❌ Forget `__reduce__` for RetryValidationError
❌ Hold limits across retry sleep periods
❌ Apply retry client-side
