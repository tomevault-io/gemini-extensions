# Loud Failures Over Silent Defaults (CRITICAL — Read This First)

**A program that crashes on misconfiguration is infinitely better than a program that silently produces wrong output.** This is the single most important principle in this codebase. Every other rule — fail-fast, strict typing, `@validate`, exhaustive dispatch, the `Any` ban — is a corollary of this principle.

**Why this is non-negotiable:** A silent wrong output destroys trust. If a worker pool silently falls back to a slower implementation because a configuration is wrong, nobody knows until mysterious slowdowns appear in production — if they ever notice. A crash at initialization with a clear error message costs thirty seconds to fix. A silent degradation can cost days of debugging.

**The test is simple:** when you write code that handles a missing or unexpected value, ask: **"If this value is wrong, would I rather crash immediately or produce incorrect/degraded behavior that looks correct?"** The answer is always crash. No one pushes code to production without testing. A crash during testing is a gift — it tells you exactly what to fix. A silent default that degrades behavior is a bomb with a delayed fuse.

LLM coding assistants are the primary source of silent-default code. They are trained on web application code where `.get(key, default)` is a reasonable defensive pattern — web apps must not crash on a single bad request. In a library/infrastructure codebase, the opposite is true: **the system MUST crash on bad configuration** so the developer fixes it before deployment.

## The `.get(key, default)` Anti-Pattern

**Never use `dict.get(key, hardcoded_default)` when the key is expected to exist.** This is the most common form of silent default. It tells the reader "this key might be absent, and that's fine." If the key *should* be present, its absence is a bug — and `.get()` with a fallback hides that bug.

**The decision rule:** ask "if this key is missing, is that a valid state or a bug?"
- **Valid state** (sparse data where absence is meaningful) → `.get(key)` returning `None`, with explicit handling of the `None` case
- **Bug** (the key should always be present given the program's logic) → use bracket access `dict[key]`, or check-and-raise with feedback

❌ Bad (silent default hides missing key):
```python
timeout = config.get("timeout", 30.0)
```

✅ Good (check, raise with feedback data, then access):
```python
if "timeout" not in config:
    raise ValueError(
        f"Expected 'timeout' in config, "
        f"but only found keys: {list(config.keys())}"
    )
timeout = config["timeout"]
```

✅ Good (bracket access — crashes immediately with a `KeyError` that names the missing key):
```python
timeout = config["timeout"]
```

✅ Best (use a Typed class so the key cannot be missing — Pydantic enforces it at construction):
```python
class WorkerConfig(Typed):
    timeout: float

config = WorkerConfig(**raw_config)  # Pydantic raises ValidationError if timeout missing
timeout = config.timeout  # Guaranteed to exist
```

## Feedback-Driven Exceptions

When raising an exception, **include the actual data** that caused the failure. The error message is feedback to the developer — it should contain enough information to diagnose and fix the problem without a debugger.

The pattern: **state what was expected, state what was received, and show the available options.**

❌ Bad (error message gives no feedback):
```python
raise ValueError("Invalid worker mode")
```

✅ Good (expected + received + available):
```python
raise ValueError(
    f"Unknown worker mode {mode!r}. "
    f"Must be one of: {list(ExecutionMode)}."
)
```

✅ Good (Pydantic/Typed already does this — leverage it):
```python
# Pydantic's ValidationError automatically includes:
# - Which field failed
# - What value was provided
# - What type/constraint was expected
# This is WHY we use @validate and Typed — they produce feedback-driven errors for free.
```

**This pattern connects to every other rule in this document:**
- **Fail Fast** (below) is the timing corollary: crash at the earliest possible point.
- **`@validate`** is the automated version: Pydantic produces feedback-driven `ValidationError` messages.
- **Exhaustive dispatch with raising `else`** catches unhandled values at dispatch time.
- **Never Hide Known Parameters in `**kwargs`** prevents silent `None` from `.get()`.
- **Never Duplicate Caller-Supplied Values as Parameter Defaults** prevents dead-code defaults from masking broken call chains.
- **Morphic `Typed` fields** replace `dict` access with validated attribute access — `.get()` is impossible on a Typed instance.
- **No Silent Fallbacks** (in concurry-architecture.mdc) is the infrastructure-level application of this same principle.

## The Silent-Default Family (All Variants)

`.get(key, default)` is the most common silent-default pattern, but it belongs to a family of related patterns that all share the same flaw: **they invent data when data is missing, instead of surfacing the absence as an error.** LLMs produce all of these reflexively. When you see any of them, apply the same decision test: "is the absence a valid state, or a bug?"

| Silent-Default Pattern | What it hides | Loud alternative |
|---|---|---|
| `dict.get(key, default)` | Missing dict key → silently substituted | `dict[key]` (KeyError) or check-and-raise |
| `getattr(obj, attr, default)` | Missing attribute → silently substituted | `obj.attr` (AttributeError) or check-and-raise |
| `hasattr(obj, attr)` + branch | Missing attribute → silently takes the else path | `obj.attr` — if the attribute should exist, access it directly and let `AttributeError` surface |
| `os.environ.get(key, default)` | Missing env var → silently substituted | `os.environ[key]` (KeyError) or check-and-raise with feedback |
| `try: ... except (KeyError, AttributeError): return fallback` | Missing key/attr → silently swallowed and replaced | Let the exception propagate; catch only at application boundaries |
| `kwargs.get("name", default)` | Known parameter hidden in `**kwargs` → silently `None` | Promote to explicit kwarg (see **Never Hide Known Parameters** below) |
| `def f(x: float = 30.0)` when caller always passes `x` | Redundant default masks broken call chain → silently uses wrong value | Remove the default; make the parameter mandatory (see **Never Duplicate Caller-Supplied Values** below) |
| `x if x is not None else 30.0` (inline magic number) | Inline fallback duplicates a config default → silently diverges when config changes | Make the parameter mandatory; no inline fallback needed |

## The `.get()` as Edge-Case Blanket Anti-Pattern (MOST DANGEROUS LLM-GENERATED VARIANT)

**This is the deadliest form of `.get()` because the developer (or LLM) knows the edge case exists, acknowledges it in a comment, and then uses `.get()` to "handle" it — which silently handles every other case too, including cases that are bugs.**

The pattern looks like this: a function receives a dict-like state object. At one specific call site (e.g., during initial pool creation before workers are started), the dict is genuinely empty — no runtime data exists yet. At every other call site (after pool startup, during normal operation), the dict must contain specific keys because initialization populated them. The LLM writes `.get("key", fallback)` and adds a comment saying "empty during init." The code works during init. It also "works" during normal operation when `"key"` is missing due to a bug — silently using the fallback instead of crashing. The pool runs with wrong configuration, and mysterious performance degradation appears.

**Why LLMs produce this reflexively:** When an LLM encounters a `KeyError` during testing, its first instinct is to make the error go away. `.get(key, default)` makes the error go away at *every* call site, not just the one where the absence is valid. The LLM cannot distinguish "this key is absent because the pool hasn't started yet" from "this key is absent because a bug in worker initialization failed to populate it." It treats both cases identically — with a silent fallback — because `.get()` does not encode *why* the key might be absent.

**The core principle:** When you know there is exactly one case where absence is valid, you must **name that case explicitly with a conditional check**. The check proves to the reader (and to future maintainers, and to the type checker, and to LLM agents reading the code) that you thought about *when* the absence is valid, not just *that* it might happen.

❌ Bad (`.get()` blankets both the valid edge case AND every bug):
```python
def _dispatch_task(self, *, pool_state: Dict[str, Any], is_initialized: bool, ...) -> ...:
    # Before pool start, no workers exist yet.
    active_workers = pool_state.get("active_workers", [])
    balancer_state = pool_state.get("balancer_state", {})
```

**What makes this catastrophic:** Before initialization, the absence is valid. After initialization, `"active_workers"` should always exist. If a bug in `_initialize_pool` fails to populate it, `.get("active_workers", [])` silently returns `[]`. The dispatcher sees zero workers, tasks go nowhere, and the pool appears to hang. Hours of debugging follow.

✅ Good (explicit conditional — names the EXACT case where absence is valid):
```python
def _dispatch_task(self, *, pool_state: Dict[str, Any], is_initialized: bool, ...) -> ...:
    if not is_initialized:
        active_workers: List[WorkerProxy] = []
        balancer_state: Dict[str, Any] = {}
    else:
        if "active_workers" not in pool_state:
            raise KeyError(
                f"pool_state missing 'active_workers' after initialization. "
                f"pool_state keys: {list(pool_state.keys())}"
            )
        active_workers = pool_state["active_workers"]
        balancer_state = pool_state["balancer_state"]
```

**The general rule:** When you encounter a `KeyError` and you know the absence is valid in one specific scenario:

1. **Identify the exact condition** under which the absence is valid (e.g., `not is_initialized`, `pool.state == "starting"`).
2. **Write an explicit conditional** that checks for that condition.
3. **In the "valid absence" branch:** provide the appropriate default explicitly.
4. **In the "invalid absence" branch:** crash loudly with a feedback-driven error message.
5. **Never use `.get()`** to handle both cases at once. `.get()` does not encode *when* the absence is valid.

**`getattr(obj, attr, default)` — the attribute version of `.get()`:**

The same decision rule applies. If the object *should* have the attribute (because you control its class, or it was passed with a type annotation that guarantees the attribute), then `getattr` with a fallback is hiding a bug.

❌ Bad (the attribute should exist — silently invents a fallback):
```python
timeout = getattr(config, "timeout", 30.0)
model_name = getattr(worker, "model_name", type(worker).__name__)
```

✅ Good (direct access — crashes immediately if the attribute is missing):
```python
timeout = config.timeout
model_name = worker.model_name
```

✅ Good (check-and-raise with feedback if you genuinely need to handle absence):
```python
if not hasattr(config, "timeout"):
    raise AttributeError(
        f"{type(config).__name__} has no 'timeout' attribute. "
        f"Available attributes: {list(vars(config).keys())}. "
        f"Ensure the config class defines 'timeout' as a field."
    )
timeout = config.timeout
```

**When `getattr` with a fallback IS acceptable:**
- **Introspection/reflection** where you are genuinely probing an unknown object's capabilities (e.g., framework code that checks whether a plugin implements an optional method). This is rare in application code.
- **`PrivateAttr` access** where Pydantic's `__getattr__` may not expose the attribute via normal attribute access in all contexts (e.g., `getattr(self, "_lock", None)` during `__getstate__` serialization). These are framework-level edge cases, not application logic.

**`hasattr()` — the check-without-consequence pattern:**

`hasattr(obj, attr)` is just `try: getattr(obj, attr); return True; except AttributeError: return False`. It silently swallows the `AttributeError`. When used to branch on whether an attribute exists, it creates two code paths — one where the attribute is present and one where it is not — without raising an error on the "not present" path. If the attribute *should* be present, this is a silent failure.

❌ Bad (silently takes an alternate code path instead of catching the bug):
```python
if hasattr(config, "load_balancing"):
    algorithm = config.load_balancing
else:
    algorithm = "round_robin"  # ← silent default, same as .get(key, default)
```

✅ Good (the attribute is expected — access it directly):
```python
algorithm = config.load_balancing  # AttributeError if missing → developer sees the bug immediately
```

**`os.environ.get()` — environment variable silent defaults:**

❌ Bad:
```python
ray_address = os.environ.get("RAY_ADDRESS", "auto")  # Silently connects to wrong cluster
```

✅ Good:
```python
if "RAY_ADDRESS" not in os.environ:
    raise EnvironmentError(
        "RAY_ADDRESS not set. Export it before running: "
        "export RAY_ADDRESS='ray://cluster-ip:10001'"
    )
ray_address = os.environ["RAY_ADDRESS"]
```
