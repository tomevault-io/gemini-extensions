## 1. The goal

Replicate the results of the paper **"TRINITY: An Evolved LLM Coordinator"**
(Xu, Sun, Schwendeman, Nielsen, Cetin, Tang — Sakana AI, ICLR 2026; arXiv:2512.04695v3)
using **open-source models** as the coordinated LLM pool instead of the paper's original
models.

TRINITY is a lightweight **coordinator** that orchestrates collaboration among several large
language models without touching their weights. It is made of two small pieces:

- a **compact language model (~0.6B parameters)** whose hidden states give a rich
  contextual representation of the query, and
- a **lightweight head (~10K parameters)** that turns that representation into a decision.

The coordinator works **over multiple turns**. At each turn it picks one LLM from the pool
and assigns it one of three roles — **Thinker, Worker, or Verifier** — so the heavy skills
live in the big models while the coordinator only learns *who should do what, when*. The head
is trained with a **separable CMA-ES** evolutionary strategy (no gradients through the big
models, no RL), which the paper shows beats RL, imitation learning, and random search under
high-dimensional, tight-budget conditions.

**Headline claim we are chasing:** TRINITY consistently beats every individual model and prior
coordination/routing methods on coding, math, reasoning, and domain knowledge, generalizes to
out-of-distribution tasks, and set a record of **86.2% on LiveCodeBench**.

### What "replication" means here

Our LLM pool is different from the paper's, so **absolute scores will differ**. Success is
defined by the paper's **relative** claims holding on our pool:

1. **Coordinated TRINITY > the best single model in the pool** on the in-distribution
   benchmark suite.
2. **TRINITY > random / static routing** baselines (same pool, same budget).
3. **sep-CMA-ES > RL / imitation / random-search** for training the head (reproduce the
   optimizer comparison).
4. The trained coordinator **generalizes to held-out / OOD tasks**.

The detailed, paper-grounded implementation spec lives in **`docs/SPEC.md`** (generated from a
careful multi-pass read of the paper). When SPEC.md and this file disagree on a number, SPEC.md
wins for implementation detail; this file owns the *intent*.

## 2. The model pool (open-source, via Fireworks)

The three coordinated LLMs are served through the **Fireworks AI** OpenAI-compatible API:

| Slot | Fireworks model ID                               | Short name      |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------- |
| A    | `accounts/fireworks/models/deepseek-v4-pro`      | `deepseek-v4-pro` |
| B    | `accounts/fireworks/models/glm-5p2`              | `glm-5p2`       |
| C    | `accounts/fireworks/models/kimi-k2p6`            | `kimi-k2p6`     |

All three were confirmed reachable with the project API key. The compact ~0.6B coordinator
encoder runs **locally on our own GPU** (see below), not on Fireworks.

---

## 3. The compute environment

- **Remote GPU box:** SSH alias `trinity-gpu` (configured in `~/.ssh/config`).
  - Hardware seen on login: **NVIDIA H200 NVL, 143 GB**, on **GPU index 5**.
  - **We are allocated GPU 5 ONLY.** Every remote process that touches CUDA **must** set
    `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=5`. Do not run anything on GPUs 0–4 or 6+. The helper scripts in
    `scripts/` enforce this; if you bypass them, set the variable yourself.
- **Local box:** orchestration, code, git. The 0.6B encoder + CMA-ES loop are meant to run on
  the remote H200; LLM calls go out to Fireworks over HTTP.

---

## 4. Security rules — non-negotiable

**No secret ever enters this repository or any commit.** This repo is private, but treat it as
if it were public.

- The **SSH private key** lives at `~/.ssh/trinity_gpu` (perms `600`), referenced only by the
  `trinity-gpu` host alias in `~/.ssh/config`. It is never copied into the project tree.
- The **Fireworks API key** lives at `~/.config/trinity/secrets.env` (perms `600`), outside the
  repo. Code reads it from the `FIREWORKS_API_KEY` environment variable.
- Before running anything: `source ~/.config/trinity/secrets.env`.
- `.gitignore` blocks `.env`, `*.key`, `*.pem`, `*trinity_gpu*`, `secrets.env`, `*token*`, etc.
  as defense-in-depth. **Run `git diff --cached` before every commit** and abort if any secret
  appears.
- Never paste the key into code, logs, prompts, commit messages, issue text, or screenshots.

## 6. ★ The logging protocol — every contributor MUST follow this

This project is a **research replication**, so the trail of what we tried, what broke, and what
we learned is as valuable as the code. **`docs/JOURNAL.md` is the lab notebook.** It is the
`.md` file where mistakes and findings go.

**Rules:**

1. **Log every mistake.** When something fails — a wrong assumption about the paper, a bug, a
   misread hyperparameter, a Fireworks/SSH/GPU gotcha, a CMA-ES divergence — add a dated entry
   to `docs/JOURNAL.md` describing: what you expected, what happened, the root cause, and the
   fix. Do not silently fix and move on.
2. **Log every finding.** Reproduced numbers, surprising ablation results, prompt tweaks that
   moved a metric, cost/latency observations, anything a future reader would want to know.
3. **Log every non-obvious decision** (and link the paper section or `[OUR CHOICE]` rationale),
   especially anywhere the paper was silent or ambiguous.
4. **Format:** newest entries at the top, each stamped `## YYYY-MM-DD — <short title>` with tags
   like `#mistake`, `#finding`, `#decision`, `#repro`. A template lives at the top of
   `JOURNAL.md`.
5. **Be honest about negative results.** If a replication target was *not* met, record it
   plainly with the gap and the suspected reason. Faithful reporting beats a clean-looking log.

If you are an AI agent: append to `docs/JOURNAL.md` as part of the same change that introduces
the work — not as an afterthought.

## 7. How to run (filled in as modules land)

```bash
# 0. load secrets (never committed)
source ~/.config/trinity/secrets.env

# 1. sanity: confirm the three Fireworks models answer
python -m trinity.llm.fireworks_client --selftest

# 2. remote GPU env (pins CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=5)
bash scripts/setup_remote.sh

# 3. evolve the coordinator head (sep-CMA-ES) on GPU 5
bash scripts/run_remote.sh train --config configs/trinity.yaml

# 4. evaluate on the benchmark suite
bash scripts/run_remote.sh eval --config configs/benchmarks.yaml
```

See `README.md` for setup and `docs/SPEC.md` for the design these commands implement.
