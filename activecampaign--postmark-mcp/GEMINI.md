# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Official Postmark MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that enables AI assistants (Claude, Cursor, etc.) to interact with the Postmark email API. Published as `@activecampaign/postmark-mcp` on NPM.

## Commands

- **Run server:** `npm start` (runs `node index.js`)
- **Debug with MCP Inspector:** `npm run inspector` (launches `@modelcontextprotocol/inspector`)
- **Smoke test (read-only):** `npm run smoke` — runs `smoke-test.mjs`, which is created from [smoke-test.example.mjs](smoke-test.example.mjs). Spawns the server over stdio and exercises every read-only tool against the live Postmark account configured in `.env`. Does not send mail or mutate state.
- **Smoke test (mutating):** `node smoke-test-mutating.mjs` — runs full create→edit→delete lifecycles for templates (including layout binding), webhooks, and suppressions, plus real email sends between two configured verified addresses. Cleans up after itself. Created from [smoke-test-mutating.example.mjs](smoke-test-mutating.example.mjs); edit `SENDER` and `RECIPIENT` before running. The script refuses to run with the placeholder values still in place.
- **`smoke-test.mjs` and `smoke-test-mutating.mjs` are gitignored.** Copy from the `*.example.mjs` counterparts; this keeps personal verified-sender addresses out of the repo.
- **No linter is configured.**

## Architecture

This is a single-file MCP server (`index.js`) using ES modules (`"type": "module"`). The structure within `index.js`:

1. **Module-level formatting helpers** — `fmtInt`, `fmtPct`, `fmtPlatformUsage`, `fmtTopBreakdown`, `fmtDeliverySummary`, `fmtStatResponse`. Used by `getDeliveryStats` to render polished per-stat output. Keep these pure / dependency-free.
2. **`initializeServices()`** — Validates required env vars, verifies connectivity via a `postmarkRequest('/server')` call, and instantiates `McpServer` from `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`
3. **`registerTools(server)`** — Registers all 24 MCP tools with Zod schemas for input validation. Each tool wraps a `postmarkRequest` call and returns formatted text responses
4. **`main()`** — Orchestrates initialization, tool registration, and connects to `StdioServerTransport`

Communication uses stdio transport (stdin/stdout), not HTTP. All `console.error` calls are diagnostic logging (stdout is reserved for MCP protocol).

## MCP Tools Registered

The server exposes 24 tools across these categories:
- **Email:** sendEmail, sendEmailWithTemplate, sendBatch, sendBatchWithTemplate
- **Templates:** listTemplates, getTemplate, createTemplate, editTemplate, deleteTemplate, validateTemplate
- **Messages:** searchOutboundMessages, getMessageDetails
- **Diagnostics:** diagnoseDelivery
- **Bounces:** searchBounces, getBounceDump, activateBounce
- **Suppressions:** listSuppressions, createSuppressions, deleteSuppressions
- **Stats & Server:** getDeliveryStats, getServerInfo
- **Webhooks:** listWebhooks, createWebhook, deleteWebhook

`sendBatch` and `sendBatchWithTemplate` wrap Postmark's *synchronous* batch endpoints (`/email/batch` and `/email/batchWithTemplates` respectively), each accepting up to 500 messages. Both share a `formatBatchResults` helper defined inside `registerTools` that splits the response by `ErrorCode` (0 = success, non-zero = failure) and renders a summary with capped success/failure lists. `sendBatchWithTemplate` accepts a top-level `from` / `tag` that's overridable per recipient — keep that override semantics if extending. Note: these are Postmark's *synchronous* batch endpoints — the API call returns per-message results in the response. Postmark's separate *asynchronous* bulk email API (`/email/bulk` — submit a job, get a request ID, poll `GET /email/bulk/{id}` for status; no message count cap, 50 MB payload limit; subject to approval) is a parallel capability not covered in v2.0. The two are parallel APIs in Postmark's docs, not one replacing the other; bulk is tracked as a v2.1 follow-up. If anyone asks "where's the bulk send tool," that's why — and adding it is more than a quick wrap because the async submit-and-poll pattern needs two tools (`submitBulk` + `getBulkStatus`).

`diagnoseDelivery` is a **composite tool** — it does not mirror a single Postmark endpoint. Instead it runs `getOutboundMessages` (or `getOutboundMessageDetails`), `getSuppressions`, and `getBounces` in parallel for the given recipient, then synthesizes a plain-English recommendation. When adding new diagnostic tools, follow the same pattern: parallelize independent lookups via `Promise.all`, swallow individual failures with `.catch(() => fallback)` so one 404 doesn't sink the whole diagnosis, and end with a `Recommended action` block that interprets the data.

`getDeliveryStats` is unified: with no arguments it returns a friendly headline summary; with `stat: "<name>"` it returns a polished per-stat breakdown. Supported `stat` values: `summary`, `overview`, `sent`, `bounces`, `spam`, `tracked`, `opens`, `openPlatforms`, `openClients`, `openReadTimes`, `clicks`, `clickBrowsers`, `clickPlatforms`, `clickLocation`. Each value maps to a specific Postmark stats endpoint (`/stats/outbound[/…]`) in the `statPaths` map inside the tool — when adding a new stat, add both the enum value and the endpoint entry.

## Environment Variables

Required (set in `.env` for local dev, or in MCP client config for production):
- `POSTMARK_SERVER_TOKEN` — Postmark server API token
- `DEFAULT_SENDER_EMAIL` — Fallback sender address
- `DEFAULT_MESSAGE_STREAM` — Message stream ID (typically `outbound`)

## Key Patterns

- All emails are auto-configured with `TrackOpens: true` and `TrackLinks: "HtmlAndText"`
- All tools call `postmarkRequest(path, options)` — a single hardened native-`fetch` client at the top of `index.js` (no SDK; the `postmark` npm package is no longer a dependency). It stamps auth (`X-Postmark-Server-Token`) plus client-identity and correlation-id headers (`X-Postmark-Client` / `X-Postmark-Client-Version` / `X-Postmark-Correlation-Id`), enforces a 60s timeout via `AbortController`, and maps non-2xx responses to `Error`s surfacing Postmark's `Message` / `ErrorCode`. A `qs()` helper builds query strings for GET filters.
- Tool handlers follow a consistent pattern: log start, call API, log result, return `{ content: [{ type: "text", text }] }`
- Postmark API field names are PascalCase (`From`, `To`, `Subject`, `EmailAddress`); query-string filters on list endpoints are typically lowercase (`fromdate`, `todate`, `messagestream`). Postmark's API is case-insensitive on query params, but match the convention you see in nearby code (build query strings with the `qs()` helper)
- Numeric IDs use `z.number().int()`; date strings use `.regex(/^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}$/)` for YYYY-MM-DD validation
- Tools that mutate state include lightweight validation guards before hitting the API:
  - `editTemplate` requires at least one updated field (otherwise the call would be a wasted no-op)
  - `createWebhook` requires at least one trigger enabled (otherwise the webhook is dead-on-arrival)
  - `createTemplate` requires at least one of `htmlBody` / `textBody`
  - `validateTemplate` requires at least one of `subject` / `htmlBody` / `textBody`
  - `sendEmailWithTemplate` requires exactly one of `templateId` / `templateAlias`

## Gotchas

- The Postmark suppressions list endpoint (`/message-streams/{stream}/suppressions/dump`) is **eventually consistent** — a suppression created milliseconds earlier may not appear in the next `listSuppressions` call. Don't write tests that assume strict read-your-writes for this endpoint.
- The `/server` endpoint (`getServerInfo`) returns `PostFirstOpenOnly` for the "first open only" tracking setting. `EnableSmtpApiErrorHooks` is a different (unrelated) flag — don't conflate them in `getServerInfo`'s output.
- The `/stats/outbound` (overview) response includes `Opens` / `UniqueOpens` despite the endpoint naming — it's broader than the name suggests, which is why `getDeliveryStats` uses it for both `summary` and `overview` modes.
- Some Postmark stats endpoints have non-obvious paths — note `/stats/outbound/opens/emailClients`, `/stats/outbound/opens/platforms`, `/stats/outbound/clicks/browserFamilies`, and `/stats/outbound/clicks/location` (see the `statPaths` map in `getDeliveryStats`).
