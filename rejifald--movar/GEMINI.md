# movar — agent guide (root)

> Movar is a cross-browser MV3 extension that keeps the internet in your language: it
> asks sites to serve your preferred language (Ukrainian-first, English fallback) and
> hides Russian content cards + Russian entries in on-site language pickers.

This file orients agents at the repo root. **Every workspace member has its own
`AGENTS.md`** with the detail you need to work in it without scanning — start there
once you know which member you're touching (links below).

## The mental model: two sequential layers

Movar's language handling is two layers that run in order on each page:

1. **Redirect layer** — ask the site to serve another language (URL params, picker
   click, hreflang, cookie/localStorage). Input: the picker's active marker, then
   markup/URL tiers (`<html lang>`, subdomain, path, self-hreflang). If it
   navigates, layer 2 is skipped.
2. **Content-filter layer** — atomically conceal individual cards whose detected
   language is blocked, behind a "curtain" overlay. Runs when layer 1 didn't navigate.

**Invariant:** the content layer never produces an aggregate verdict that feeds the
redirect layer (that would cause redirect/bounce "hiccups"). And Movar **blocks, never
translates** — translating Russian would launder it into trusted Ukrainian.

## Architecture: pure model packages vs. app orchestration

The content-script engine is split so the reusable logic is package-clean:

- **Pure model packages** — [`@movar/page-mode`](packages/page-mode/AGENTS.md),
  [`@movar/page-content`](packages/page-content/AGENTS.md),
  [`@movar/lang-pickers`](packages/lang-pickers/AGENTS.md),
  [`@movar/page-language`](packages/page-language/AGENTS.md). They **read** the DOM and
  build models but **never** import i18n, the curtain/tooltip overlays, or the
  page-mode color-scheme singleton. Consumed by both the extension and the diagnostics
  shadow-oracle.
- **App orchestration** — the DOM-mutating concealment (`content-conceal.ts` →
  `applyContentFilter`, `picker-filter.ts` → `filterPickers`), the overlays
  (`curtain.ts`/`tooltip.ts`), and the i18n catalog all live in
  [`apps/extension`](apps/extension/AGENTS.md). Don't move these into the model packages.

## Monorepo map

pnpm + nx workspace: `apps/*`, `packages/*`, `tooling/*`.

### Tooling

| Member                                                                 | What it is                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`tooling/eslint-config-movar`](tooling/eslint-config-movar/AGENTS.md) | Shared ESLint 9 flat-config presets (`base`, `quality`, `tests`, `ukrainian`, `react`, `boundaries`, …) every member composes |

## Toolchain & commands

Node ≥22, pnpm, TypeScript (strict, ESM, `verbatimModuleSyntax`), Vitest 4, ESLint 9
(flat config), Prettier, nx (cached targets).

```sh
# whole workspace
pnpm validate        # typecheck + lint + test + publint + check:readme
pnpm typecheck       # nx run-many -t typecheck
pnpm lint            # lint:root + nx run-many -t lint
pnpm test            # nx run-many -t test  (excludes e2e)
pnpm check:readme    # README tagline + monorepo-layout parity guard
pnpm dev             # process-compose: marketing :4321, storybook :6006/:6007
pnpm build           # nx run-many -t build

# a single member (from its dir, or via nx)
pnpm --filter @movar/<name> test
nx run <project>:typecheck   # <project> = page-mode, extension, …

# e2e (excluded from `pnpm test`)
pnpm test:e2e:fast           # offline CI
pnpm test:e2e:live[:headed]  # manual, real sites
```

Each member: `package.json` (private, `type: module`, libs map `main`/`types`/`exports`
→ `src/index.ts` with a `"./*"` wildcard subpath), `tsconfig.json` (extends
`tsconfig.base.json`), `eslint.config.mjs`, `project.json` (nx targets), and libs a
`vitest.config.ts`. `@movar/*` path aliases (bare + `/*`) live in `tsconfig.base.json`.

## Conventions & invariants (repo-wide)

- **Leaf packages stay focused** — never a utility dump. `@movar/lang-detect` (which
  now defines `LanguageCode`) and `@movar/brand` are the zero-`@movar`-dep leaves. New
  logic goes in a specific package or a thematic existing one — code normalization lives
  in `@movar/lang-detect`; the `brand` / `settings` / `events` split is the example of
  doing it right rather than dumping into one grab-bag package.
- **Icons are lucide** everywhere: `lucide-astro` in `.astro`, `lucide-react` in React,
  `lucide` core in vanilla content scripts. Never hand-inline SVG paths.
- **Observability ships separately** ([`apps/diagnostics`](apps/diagnostics/AGENTS.md))
  and must never land in the published extension, even off-by-default.
- **Test infrastructure stays detached from runtime source.** Do not put
  `*ForTest`, `__test`, `__internal`, reset hooks, fake loaders, fixtures, or
  test-only comments inside production modules. Prefer production-shaped
  factories, dependency injection, unregister handles, or dedicated files under
  `test/`, `__tests__/`, `test-utils/`, or `test-helpers/`.
- **Issue reporting is a `mailto`**, never a backend — the extension sends nothing
  off-device (network-silent guarantee).
- **`contentModification` is off by default** (see `defaultSettings`); Russian is a
  permanently locked-blocked language.
- **Don't commit or push unless asked.** Release ritual: every behaviour-changing PR
  carries a changeset (`pnpm changeset`). To cut a version, branch
  `release/extension-vX.Y.Z` and run `pnpm version:packages` (= `changeset version`
  - format) **by hand** — the `Version` workflow that used to open the
    `chore: version packages` PR is broken (`GitHub Actions is not permitted to create
or approve pull requests`), so nothing bumps the version for you. The same PR
    hand-bumps Safari's `MARKETING_VERSION` and adds a bilingual (uk + en) block to
    `apps/extension/store-assets/apple/WHATS-NEW.md`. Then tag `extension-vX.Y.Z`
    (must match `apps/extension/package.json`) — but **a tag alone submits nothing**:
    only _publishing_ the GitHub Release on that tag reaches AMO + Chrome Web Store +
    Edge, each parked behind the `production` approval gate. Safari is submitted
    locally through Xcode Organizer. Full ritual: [`docs/release-credentials.md`](docs/release-credentials.md).

## Key docs

- [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) — human contributor entry point (setup, two-layer model, where a site rule lives, gate commands); links back into this tree. Site-rule walkthrough: [`apps/extension/src/sites/CONTRIBUTING-A-SITE.md`](apps/extension/src/sites/CONTRIBUTING-A-SITE.md).
- [`docs/glossary.md`](docs/glossary.md) — domain terms (SERP, curtain, rung, the two layers, package map). Start here if the jargon is unfamiliar.
- [`README.md`](README.md) — public overview + monorepo layout (parity-guarded).
- [`docs/copy.md`](docs/copy.md) — copy authority (voice, lexicon, mechanics); [`docs/styleguide.md`](docs/styleguide.md) — style.
- [`docs/ROADMAP.md`](docs/ROADMAP.md) — what's next.
- [`scripts/prepare-safari-build.sh`](scripts/prepare-safari-build.sh) — local macOS + iOS Safari App Store build: syncs the two gitignored Xcode resource trees, then (given `APPLE_TEAM_ID`) archives + exports both apps with the version stamped from `apps/extension/package.json`. Manual fallback for when CI's `release-safari` job can't sign.
- [`docs/metrics-gate.md`](docs/metrics-gate.md) — the PR-time metrics gate (coverage/quality regressions), its `accept-metrics-regression` override, and the branch ruleset that enforces it.
- [`docs/page-content-and-lang-pickers-refactor.md`](docs/page-content-and-lang-pickers-refactor.md) — the model-layer split rationale.
- [`docs/pitfalls.md`](docs/pitfalls.md) — recurring bug **classes** (issue signatures) + the durable guard for each, each entry self-sufficient to identify and fix. Add one when a fix turns out to be an instance of a general pattern.
