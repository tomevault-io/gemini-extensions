## Project Overview

**worker-fs-mount** is an npm package that allows Cloudflare Workers to mount WorkerEntrypoints as virtual filesystems. It provides a drop-in replacement for `node:fs/promises` that intercepts filesystem calls and redirects mounted paths to WorkerEntrypoint implementations via jsrpc.

### Key Concept

Users call `mount('/mnt/path', stub)` where `stub` is a WorkerEntrypoint (from `ctx.exports`, `env.SERVICE`, or a Durable Object stub). After mounting, any `node:fs/promises` operation targeting that path is forwarded to the stub's methods.

```typescript
import { env } from 'cloudflare:workers';
import { mount } from 'worker-fs-mount';
import fs from 'node:fs/promises';  // Aliased to our implementation

// Mount at module level using importable env
mount('/mnt/storage', env.STORAGE_SERVICE);

export default {
  async fetch(request) {
    await fs.readFile('/mnt/storage/file.txt');  // → calls env.STORAGE_SERVICE.readFile('/file.txt')
  }
};
```

**Global/module-level mounts** (preferred): Mount at module scope using `import { env, exports } from 'cloudflare:workers'`. Works for R2, KV, service bindings, and same-worker entrypoints. Simple, no cleanup needed.

**Request-scoped mounts**: Required for Durable Objects (getting a DO stub is IO and requires request scope). Use `withMounts` when different requests need different mounts (e.g., per-user DOs) to prevent mount collisions.

## Build & Development Commands

From the root directory:

```bash
pnpm install         # Install dependencies (uses pnpm workspaces)
pnpm build           # Compile TypeScript to dist/
pnpm dev             # Watch mode compilation
pnpm typecheck       # Type check without emitting
pnpm test            # Run integration tests
pnpm clean           # Remove dist/
```

## Architecture

### How Module Aliasing Works

The package uses wrangler's `[alias]` feature to replace `node:fs/promises` at build time:

1. Users add an alias in their `wrangler.toml`:
   ```toml
   [alias]
   "node:fs/promises" = "worker-fs-mount/fs"
   ```

2. **`fs-promises.ts`** exports all standard `node:fs/promises` functions
3. Each function checks if the path is under a mount:
   - If mounted: calls the stub's method via jsrpc and returns the result
   - If not mounted: calls the real `node:fs/promises` method (via `node:fs` sync module's `.promises`)

### Mount Registry (`registry.ts`)

- `mounts`: `Map<string, Mount>` - stores active mounts keyed by normalized path
- `mount(path, stub)`: validates path, checks for conflicts, adds to registry
- `findMount(path)`: iterates mounts to find longest matching prefix
- `normalizePath(path)`: removes trailing slashes, collapses multiple slashes

### Type System (`types.ts`)

- **`WorkerFilesystem`**: stream-first interface that mounted stubs must implement
  - Required (6): `stat`, `createReadStream`, `createWriteStream`, `readdir`, `mkdir`, `rm`
  - Optional (2): `symlink`, `readlink`
  - Derived operations (implemented in fs-promises.ts): `readFile`, `writeFile`, `truncate`, `rename`, `cp`, `unlink`, `access`, `appendFile`
- **`Stat`**: `{ type: 'file'|'directory'|'symlink', size: number, lastModified?: Date, ... }`
- **`DirEntry`**: `{ name: string, type: 'file'|'directory'|'symlink' }`

## Key Implementation Details

### Path Handling

- All mount paths must be absolute (start with `/`)
- Paths are normalized: trailing slashes removed, multiple slashes collapsed
- Reserved paths (`/bundle`, `/tmp`, `/dev`) cannot be mounted over
- Nested mounts are not allowed (can't mount `/a/b` if `/a` is mounted)

### Type Conversions (in fs-promises.ts)

- `toNodeStats(Stat)`: converts our Stat to Node.js Stats object with all required methods (`isFile()`, `isDirectory()`, etc.)
- `toNodeDirent(DirEntry)`: converts our DirEntry to Node.js Dirent object
- `createFsError(code, syscall, path)`: creates Node.js-style errors with `.code`, `.syscall`, `.path`

### Cross-Mount Operations

- `rename`: throws `EXDEV` if source and dest are on different mounts
- `copyFile`/`cp`: works across mounts by reading from source and writing to dest
- Directory copy across mounts is not yet implemented (throws `EISDIR`)

## Testing

Tests run a real wrangler worker with the alias configured, making HTTP requests to test the full flow.

### Running Tests

```bash
pnpm test            # Run all tests
pnpm test:watch      # Watch mode
```

### Test Architecture

The tests use a **pnpm workspace** setup where `packages/tests/` is a workspace package that depends on the `worker-fs-mount` package. This demonstrates real-world usage where the alias references an npm package.

1. **`pnpm-workspace.yaml`** defines `packages/*` as workspace packages

2. **`packages/tests/package.json`** declares dependency on worker-fs-mount:
   ```json
   {
     "dependencies": {
       "worker-fs-mount": "workspace:*"
     }
   }
   ```

3. **`packages/tests/wrangler.toml`** configures the alias to use the package:
   ```toml
   [alias]
   "node:fs/promises" = "worker-fs-mount/fs"
   ```

4. **`packages/tests/index.ts`** is the test worker that:
   - Mounts `ctx.exports.MemoryFilesystem` at `/mnt/test`
   - Exposes HTTP endpoints for each fs operation
   - Uses the aliased `node:fs/promises`

5. **`packages/tests/index.test.ts`** spawns `wrangler dev` and makes HTTP requests

6. **`packages/tests/memory-filesystem.ts`** is an in-memory WorkerFilesystem implementation

## Common Development Tasks

### Adding a New fs Method

Most fs methods should be derived from the core streaming interface. Only add to `WorkerFilesystem` if the operation cannot be expressed using the existing core methods.

**For derived operations** (preferred):
1. Add the function to `packages/worker-fs-mount/src/fs-promises.ts`
2. Implement using `createReadStream`, `createWriteStream`, `stat`, `rm`, etc.
3. Add test endpoint in `packages/tests/index.ts`
4. Add test case in `packages/tests/index.test.ts`
5. Update README.md with the new method

**For core operations** (only if truly necessary):
1. Add method to `WorkerFilesystem` interface in `packages/worker-fs-mount/src/types.ts`
2. Implement in all filesystem packages (memory-fs, r2-fs, durable-object-fs)
3. Add wrapper in `fs-promises.ts`
4. Add tests and update docs

### Adding a New Export

1. Add to `packages/worker-fs-mount/src/index.ts` exports
2. Run `pnpm build` to regenerate `.d.ts` files
3. Update README.md API Reference section

## Dependencies

- **@types/node**: Node.js type definitions (for fs types)
- **typescript**: TypeScript compiler
- **vitest**: Test runner
- **wrangler**: Cloudflare Workers CLI (for testing)

The package has no runtime dependencies - it only uses `node:fs/promises` and `node:buffer` which are available in the Workers runtime.

## Package Exports

The package provides two entry points:

```json
{
  "exports": {
    ".": "./dist/index.js",         // mount(), withMounts(), unmount(), isMounted(), etc.
    "./fs": "./dist/fs-promises.js", // Drop-in replacement for node:fs/promises
    "./utils": "./dist/utils.js"     // Shared utilities for filesystem implementations
  }
}
```

## Related Documentation

- **README.md**: User-facing documentation with examples (in packages/worker-fs-mount/)

## Coding Standards

- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- ESM modules only (`"type": "module"` in package.json)
- Use `.js` extensions in imports (required for ESM)
- Follow Node.js fs error conventions (use `createFsError()`)
- All async methods should handle both mounted and non-mounted paths
