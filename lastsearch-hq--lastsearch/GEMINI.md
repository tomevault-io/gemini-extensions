# CLAUDE.md — LastSearch

## What this project is

LastSearch is open-source research infrastructure for AI agents. It gives agents real-time web search with evidence-backed citations and confidence scores. Available as MCP server, REST API, and Python SDK.

**Tagline:** Reliable Research Infrastructure for AI Agents

## Monorepo structure

```
apps/mcp/          — MCP server (npm: lastsearch)
packages/shared/   — Shared types, schemas, constants
packages/python-sdk/ — Python SDK (PyPI: lastsearch)
src/               — Vite + React frontend (landing, developers, playground pages)
```

> The verification engine (Fastify REST API) has been moved to a separate private repository: [lastsearch-hq/lastsearch-engine](https://github.com/lastsearch-hq/lastsearch-engine). The public repo's frontend proxies `/api/*` requests to the hosted engine.

## Two-Repo Architecture

This project spans **two repositories**. Always consider both when making changes:

| Repo | Visibility | What lives here | Deploys to |
|------|-----------|-----------------|------------|
| **lastsearch** (this repo) | Public (Apache 2.0) | MCP server, Python SDK, frontend, shared types, examples, docs | Vercel (frontend + MCP function) |
| **lastsearch-engine** (`/tmp/lastsearch-engine`) | Private (BSL 1.1) | Verification engine, API routes, NLI, confidence scoring, Redis cache, Supabase | Vercel (separate project) |

**When making changes:**
- **API parameter changes** → update engine routes + MCP tool schemas + Python SDK methods + shared types
- **New features** → engine implementation + public repo surfaces (MCP, SDK, docs, frontend)
- **Auth/key changes** → both repos (engine auth middleware + MCP/SDK client code)
- **Version bumps** → public repo only (MCP package.json + index.ts, Python SDK pyproject.toml + __init__.py)

**All API access requires a LastSearch key (`ls_xxx`).** There is no BYOK (bring your own keys) mode. The engine handles all search and LLM calls server-side.

## Key commands

```bash
pnpm dev:web          # Frontend only (Vite)
pnpm build            # Full build (Vercel)
pnpm test             # Run tests (vitest)
npx pnpm --filter lastsearch build  # Build MCP only
```

> The API server is hosted separately (lastsearch-engine repo). There is no `dev:api` command in this repo.

## Architecture decisions

- **Engine deployment:** The verification engine (API server) lives in a separate private repo ([lastsearch-hq/lastsearch-engine](https://github.com/lastsearch-hq/lastsearch-engine)) and is deployed as a hosted service. This public repo's frontend proxies `/api/*` requests to the engine. All API access requires a `ls_xxx` key.
- **LLM:** Google Gemini 2.5 Flash via OpenRouter (`packages/shared/src/constants.ts`)
- **Search:** Multi-provider search — primary search API + secondary provider for source diversity (parallel execution, deduplicated results).
- **Verification pipeline:** Hybrid BM25 + dense embeddings + NLI semantic entailment → cross-source consensus → NLI contradiction detection. Falls back to BM25-only when premium keys not set.
- **Embedding retrieval:** OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small` via OpenRouter for semantic candidate retrieval. BM25 + embedding rankings fused via Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF). Catches paraphrased claims BM25 misses. Premium tier only, graceful BM25 fallback.
- **NLI reranking:** Top-3 RRF-fused candidates per claim reranked by DeBERTa NLI entailment scores. Picks best supporting evidence semantically, not just by keyword match.
- **Atomic claim decomposition:** Compound claims auto-split into individual verifiable facts before verification. Splitters: `and`, `;`, `while`/`whereas`/`but`.
- **Multi-pass consistency:** In thorough mode, claims cross-checked across two independent extraction passes. Confirmed claims boosted (+0.08), unconfirmed penalized (-0.05). SelfCheckGPT-inspired.
- **Confidence scores:** 8-factor evidence-based algorithm — NOT LLM self-assessed. Auto-calibrated from user feedback via isotonic regression (70% calibrated + 30% original blending). Factors: verification rate (22%), domain authority (18%), source count (15%), consensus (12%), domain diversity (10%), claim grounding (10%), source recency (8%), citation depth (5%). Contradiction penalty applied.
- **Domain authority:** 10,000+ domains in Supabase (260 curated + Majestic Million), 5-tier scoring with Bayesian dynamic blending from real query verification data. Cold-start safe via prior weight smoothing.
- **Thorough mode:** `depth: "thorough"` runs iterative confidence-gated loop (FIRE-inspired, up to 3 passes) with per-claim evidence retrieval (SAFE-inspired) and counter-query adversarial verification (SANCTUARY-inspired). Early termination via query similarity detection. Runs multi-pass consistency checking. Available across API, MCP, and Python SDK.
- **Per-claim evidence retrieval:** After initial extraction, weak claims (unverified or low score) get targeted LLM-generated search queries. Each claim gets its own evidence from all providers (Tavily + Brave + Exa). Boosted claims get new sources added. Premium tier only.
- **Counter-query verification:** Verified claims are stress-tested with adversarial "what would disprove this?" search queries. If counter-evidence snippets contain strong negation signals, claim scores are penalized. Premium tier only.
- **Cached secondary search:** Brave and Exa search results are cached (10 min TTL) to avoid wasting API credits on page refresh or pipeline retries.
- **Tier gating:** `ls_` API key users get premium pipeline (NLI reranking, multi-provider search, multi-pass consistency). Demo users get BM25-only verification. Controlled via `hasBaiKey` flag in engine.
- **Premium quota:** Free LastSearch key users get 100 premium queries/day (`FREE_PREMIUM_DAILY_LIMIT`). Deep mode costs 3x. Tracked via Redis counter (`premium_quota:{userId}`, 24hr TTL). When exceeded, premium keys are stripped — graceful fallback to BM25 keyword verification. Quota info returned in API responses as `{ quota: { used, limit, premiumActive, resetsInSeconds } }`. Increment happens after successful answer/stream queries only.
- **Caching:** Upstash Redis (via Vercel KV) with smart TTL (time-sensitive queries get shorter TTL). Falls back to in-memory if KV env vars not set. Cache key includes depth param.
- **Demo rate limit:** 1 query/hour per IP for unauthenticated users.
- **API keys:** All API access requires a LastSearch API key (`ls_xxx` prefix). Demo mode on the website uses server-side keys with rate limits.

## Environment variables

For this public repo (MCP server + frontend only):

```
LASTSEARCH_API_KEY        — LastSearch API key (ls_xxx) for MCP server
```

> All server-side environment variables (search APIs, LLM keys, Supabase, Redis, etc.) are configured in the lastsearch-engine private repo.

## Deployment

- **Frontend:** Vercel (auto-deploys from main). Proxies `/api/*` to the hosted engine.
- **Engine:** Deployed separately from the lastsearch-engine private repo.
- **MCP (npm):** Auto-publishes via `.github/workflows/publish-npm.yml` on push to main
- **Python SDK (PyPI):** Auto-publishes via `.github/workflows/publish-pypi.yml` on push to main
- **Branch protection:** main is protected. All changes go through PRs from `shreyas` branch.
- **Version bumps:** Bump version in feature branch before merging — CI skips publish if version unchanged.

## Coding conventions

- TypeScript strict mode for API and shared packages
- React with Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components
- Framer Motion for animations on landing/dev pages
- Keep API responses as `{ success: boolean, result?: T, error?: string }`

## MANDATORY: Ship checklist — run this after every feature

**CRITICAL: Every feature MUST update all surfaces before committing. No exceptions. Code without doc/site updates is incomplete work. Update as you go, not as a separate task.**

Every time a new feature is implemented, go through this checklist before considering it done. This ensures all surfaces stay in sync.

### 1. Code (always)
- [ ] Types updated in `packages/shared/src/types.ts`
- [ ] Schemas updated in `packages/shared/src/schemas.ts`
- [ ] Build all packages: `npx pnpm --filter shared build && npx pnpm --filter lastsearch build`
- [ ] Run tests: `npx pnpm test`
- [ ] Full build passes: `npx pnpm build`

### 2. API surfaces (if feature adds/changes parameters or behavior)
- [ ] MCP tool schema updated in `apps/mcp/src/index.ts` (params, description)
- [ ] Python SDK methods updated in `packages/python-sdk/lastsearch/client.py` (both sync + async)
- [ ] Python SDK models updated in `packages/python-sdk/lastsearch/models.py` (if new response fields)

> REST API routes are in the lastsearch-engine private repo. Coordinate changes there if needed.

### 3. Documentation (if feature is user-facing)
- [ ] `README.md` — Update feature list, verification pipeline description, API examples
- [ ] `src/pages/Index.tsx` — Landing page pipeline steps, "Why LastSearch" section, example JSON output
- [ ] `src/pages/Developers.tsx` — Roadmap items (mark Done/update descriptions), code examples
- [ ] `apps/mcp/README.md` — MCP tool docs if tool params changed
- [ ] `packages/python-sdk/README.md` — Python SDK usage examples if method signatures changed

### 4. Versioning (if publishing)
- [ ] Bump version in `apps/mcp/package.json` AND `apps/mcp/src/index.ts` (`VERSION` constant) — must match
- [ ] Bump version in `packages/python-sdk/pyproject.toml` AND `packages/python-sdk/lastsearch/__init__.py` (`__version__`) — must match
- [ ] CI auto-publishes on merge to main but **skips if version unchanged** — always bump before merging
- [ ] Update `CLAUDE.md` architecture section if significant new capability

### 5. Ship
- [ ] Commit with descriptive message
- [ ] Push to `shreyas` branch
- [ ] Create PR to `main`
- [ ] Verify PR build passes before merge
