# Agent Configuration and Instructions

This document provides guidance for AI agents and automated tools working with this Android Flutter repository. It serves as the primary rules file for both [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) and GitHub Copilot.

## Quick Reference for AI Agents

**First-Time Users**: Direct them to [GETTING_STARTED.md](GETTING_STARTED.md) for complete setup guide.

**Customization**: Use [APP_CUSTOMIZATION.md](APP_CUSTOMIZATION.md) for comprehensive customization checklist with AI prompts.

**Important Files to Update When Renaming App**:
- `pubspec.yaml` (name, description)
- `lib/main.dart` (imports, title)
- `test/widget_test.dart` (imports)
- `android/app/build.gradle.kts` (namespace, applicationId)
- `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` (label)

## Repository Overview

This is **Private Chat Hub** - a privacy-first Android app for chatting with self-hosted AI models via Ollama. Built with Flutter, it features an optimized build system (Java 17, parallel builds, caching), comprehensive CI/CD, and AI-powered development workflow.

## AI Agent Tooling

This project supports two AI agent platforms with parallel configurations:

| Platform | Config | Agents | Skills/Commands |
|----------|--------|--------|-----------------|
| **OpenCode** | `opencode.json` + `.opencode/` | `.opencode/agents/*.md` | `.opencode/skills/`, `.opencode/commands/` (in opencode.json) |
| **GitHub Copilot** | `.github/agents/*.agent.md` | `.github/agents/` | `.github/skills/` |

### OpenCode Setup

OpenCode reads this `AGENTS.md` file automatically as project rules. Additional configuration:

- **Config**: `opencode.json` - formatter, custom commands, instruction files
- **Agents**: `.opencode/agents/` - 6 specialized agents (flutter-developer, architect, researcher, product-owner, experience-designer, doc-writer)
- **Skills**: `.opencode/skills/` - 4 skills (build-fix, android-debug, ci-debug, icon-generation)
- **Commands**: `/test`, `/build`, `/analyze`, `/fix`, `/clean`, `/check`

Switch agents with **Tab** in the TUI. Use `@agent-name` to invoke subagents. Use `/command` for quick actions.

### GitHub Copilot Agents

6 specialized agents in `.github/agents/`:

| Agent | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **@product-owner** | Define features, requirements, user stories |
| **@experience-designer** | Design UX, user flows, wireframes |
| **@architect** | Plan architecture, technical decisions |
| **@researcher** | Research packages, best practices |
| **@flutter-developer** | Implement features, write tests, debug |
| **@doc-writer** | Create documentation, guides |

### Skills (Both Platforms)

| Skill | Purpose | When to Use |
|-------|---------|-------------|

## AI Customization Points

When using this template, AI agents should focus on these key customization areas:

### 1. App Identity (pubspec.yaml)
```yaml
name: your_app_name           # Change app name
description: "Your app description"
version: 1.0.0+1              # Update version
```

### 2. App Entry Point (lib/main.dart)
- Change `title` in MaterialApp
- Modify `colorScheme` seedColor for theming
- Replace `MyHomePage` with your own screens

### 3. Android Configuration
- `android/app/build.gradle.kts`: Change `applicationId`
- `android/app/build.gradle.kts`: Configure signing (see release workflow)

## Flutter Commands

### Basic Commands
```bash
# Get dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run app
flutter run

# Build release
flutter build apk           # Android APK
flutter build appbundle     # Android App Bundle

# Run tests
flutter test

# Analyze code
flutter analyze
```

## CI/CD Workflows

### build.yml
- Runs on push to main/develop and PRs
- **Auto-formats code and commits changes** - No need to worry about formatting
- Applies `dart fix --apply` for automatic lint fixes
- Builds APK and App Bundle
- Runs tests with parallel execution
- Uploads coverage to Codecov
- Uses CI-optimized Gradle properties
- Implements caching for Gradle, Flutter, and pub packages
- Concurrency control to cancel duplicate runs
- Timeout: 30 minutes

### release.yml
- Triggered by version tags (v*)
- Builds signed release artifacts
- Creates GitHub Release with auto-generated notes
- Uses CI-optimized Gradle properties
- Artifact retention: 90 days
- Timeout: 45 minutes

**Required Secrets for Signed Releases:**
- `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64`: Base64-encoded keystore file
- `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`: Keystore password
- `ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS`: Key alias
- `ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD`: Key password

### pre-release.yml
- Manual workflow dispatch for beta/alpha releases
- Customizable version naming
- Creates pre-release on GitHub
- Supports alpha, beta, and pre-release types
- Artifacts named with version and release type

## Build Optimization

This template includes comprehensive build optimizations:

### Java 17 Baseline
- Modern Android development standard
- Required for optimal performance
- Configured across all Gradle files

### Gradle Configuration
- **Local Development** (`android/gradle.properties`):
  - Parallel builds with 4 workers
  - Configuration caching enabled
  - 4GB heap memory allocation
  - Build daemon enabled
  
- **CI Environment** (`android/gradle-ci.properties`):
  - Parallel builds with 2 workers
  - Configuration caching disabled
  - 3GB heap memory allocation
  - Build daemon disabled

### Performance Features
- R8 code shrinking and resource shrinking
- Disabled unused build features (buildConfig, aidl, renderScript, shaders)
- Non-final resource IDs for faster builds
- Non-transitive R classes

### Expected Build Times
- Local cached: 30-60s (debug), 1-2min (release)
- CI cached: 3-5 minutes (full workflow)
- Release APK: ~60MB (40-60% smaller than debug)

## VS Code Tool Usage Guidelines

### When to Use Each Tool

**#tool:terminal**:
- Running Flutter commands (run, build, test, analyze)
- Installing dependencies (flutter pub get)
- Formatting code (dart format)
- Running scripts
- Checking git status
- Building for Android

**#tool:runTests**:
- Executing specific test files
- Running test suites
- Quick test feedback
- Integration with VS Code test explorer

**#tool:debugger**:
- Setting breakpoints in code
- Inspecting variables and state
- Stepping through code execution
- Debugging complex logic
- Widget tree inspection

**#tool:problems**:
- Viewing compiler errors
- Checking linter warnings
- Finding syntax errors
- Identifying deprecation warnings

**#tool:changes**:
- Reviewing uncommitted changes
- Checking git diff
- Verifying edits before commit
- Understanding modified files

**#tool:codebase**:
- Understanding project structure
- Finding existing implementations
- Discovering patterns
- Navigating large codebases

**#tool:search**:
- Finding specific code patterns
- Locating class/method definitions
- Searching across files
- Finding usage examples

## Best Practices for AI Agents

1. **Always use terminal to verify changes** - Run tests and analyzer after implementation
2. **Save documentation to docs/** - Future agents can reference prior decisions
3. **Use descriptive file names** - Prefix with REQUIREMENTS_, UX_DESIGN_, ARCHITECTURE_, etc.
4. **Check problems before finishing** - Use #tool:problems to catch errors early
5. **Review changes with #tool:changes** - Ensure no unintended modifications
6. **Run tests with #tool:runTests or #tool:terminal** - Verify functionality
7. **CI will auto-format code** - No need to run `dart format` manually; CI handles formatting and commits changes
8. **Use codebase to understand context** - Don't guess patterns, search for them
9. **Handoff between agents** - Use handoff features for multi-stage tasks
10. **Reference documentation files** - Link to docs/ files for context

## Troubleshooting Guide for Agents

### Build Fails

```bash
# Use #tool:terminal to run:
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter pub upgrade --major-versions  # if needed
flutter analyze
```

### Import Errors After Rename

```bash
# Use #tool:terminal:
flutter clean
flutter pub get
dart fix --apply
```

### Test Failures

```bash
# Use #tool:runTests or #tool:terminal:
flutter test --verbose
# Check #tool:testFailure for context
# Use #tool:debugger to set breakpoints
```

### Performance Issues

```bash
# Use #tool:terminal:
flutter run --profile
flutter build apk --analyze-size
# Use Flutter DevTools for profiling
```
