# AGENTS.md

Working contract for humans and coding agents contributing to RimZ. Read on entry. Topic detail lives in the leaves linked from the [documentation map](#documentation-map); never duplicate it here.

> **Invariant.** RimZ routes attention: it surfaces which agent needs you and takes you straight to its pane, where you answer in the agent's own UI.

A child `AGENTS.md` under a subtree extends this file with local constraints; it never restates parent rules.

## Tone

Declarative, present tense. State the contract; don't narrate history. Prefer imperatives (`Use Result.`) over prohibitions.

Lead with the capability, and introduce a concept by what it does before leaning on it — say what queuing *does* (hold text for the agent's next open turn) rather than "a queued message never interrupts a turn". State a safety boundary as a positive commitment (`Hook stdout is the decision channel.`); avoid "X is a Y, not a Z" and defensive "we don't…" / "it never…" framing. Reserve negation for genuine disambiguation.

Markdown prose uses one logical line per paragraph, list item, and blockquote paragraph. Do not hard-wrap.

## Engineering principles

- **Explicit Rust.** Typed IDs, state machines, structured parsers, explicit errors. Domain errors return `Result`; `unwrap`/`expect`/panic belong in tests, build scripts, and provably-impossible states (with a comment).
- **Strong types** for workspace, request, pane, agent-kind, and agent-session IDs, and for surfaces, statuses, and protocol versions.
- **Structured parsers** for TOML, JSON, KDL, and agent payloads.
- **Store durability.** File-state writes use temp-file plus rename; event-log writes follow the [store durability contract](./docs/internals/store.md).
- **Fail-fast on preconditions.** A configured capability that cannot work fails at the entry point with the fix — `rimz start` refuses rather than launching a degraded surface. Best-effort is for latency and enrichment (sidebar wakeups, app-server context), never for a precondition the user switched on.

## Product invariants

- **Durability first.** Correctness lives in durable records, CAS rules, nonces, and per-request sockets. Wakeups and pane reads are latency, never truth.
- **Automation is accountable.** User-benefiting automation appends durable assist records and surfaces in `rimz stats`; internal repairs keep durable diagnostic records ([loops.md](./docs/internals/harness/loops.md#the-assist-log), [diagnostics.md](./docs/internals/diagnostics.md)).
- **One interface language.** Every human-facing surface resolves color through the [shared theme core](./docs/internals/theme.md): provider identity for names and emblems, typed state roles, hierarchy tones, and quantity tones; invariants enforce the renderer boundaries.
- **Hook stdout is the decision channel.** Logs go to stderr or RimZ state logs; hook helper children get fresh stdio.
- **Cross-backend parity.** Zellij and tmux are first-class; core behaviour never depends on a backend-only feature.
- **Pane I/O is explicit.** `pane capture` and `pane send` are public primitives, and `message` routes human text through the same send path; pane reads stay in rendering, explicit `pane capture` calls, and Codex turn-death confirmation.
- **Sidebar is read-only on the store.** Sidebar code reads via `rimz sidebar snapshot`; store-write modules stay out of the sidebar's import graph.
- **Trust is product behaviour.** Every command-executing config field is in the trust hash, with a test that proves it.
- **Security surfaces stay visible.** Project trust, notification handlers, hook install diffs, and privacy settings are product behaviour.

## Room quick reference

Addresses are `@handle[#channel]`; full grammar lives in [agents.md](./docs/reference/cli/agents.md).

```sh
rimz agents                          # agent cards, current channel
rimz agents '#auth'                  # one lane's cards
rimz agents show @coder              # card: activity, context, messages, transcript
rimz agents logs @coder -n 20        # transcript tail (-f follows)
rimz agents history @coder -n 10     # per-turn tokens, cost, and outcome
rimz agents restart @coder           # bounce in place and resume the session
rimz agents resume '#docs'           # restore every closed place in one lane
rimz message @coder "rebase first"   # park for the next turn boundary
rimz message @coder --wait "did the migration land? one line" # ask and print the reply
rimz message --steer @coder "stop"   # interrupt the live turn now
rimz message show msg_<id>           # why a message hasn't landed
rimz asks --json                     # structured prompts that currently block agents
rimz answer @coder 2                 # answer the current supported prompt in its native UI
rimz pane list                       # every pane, labelled with @handles
rimz pane capture @coder             # what the agent's pane shows right now
rimz loop show <task>                # schedule, next fire, run forensics
rimz loop logs <task>                # full forensics for recent runs
```

## Implementation rules

- `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` are one file via symlink; edits to either land in both.
- Rust unless the task targets docs, tests, scripts, examples, or build glue.
- Root docs stay short and authoritative; detail lives in `docs/` and is linked.
- Update the [code map](#code-map) when modules move, [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) when the runtime shape changes, and [DESIGN.md](./DESIGN.md) only when a product or runtime invariant changes.
- Contributor automation lives in `xtask/`; command surface and gate stack in [rust-conventions.md](./docs/contributing/rust-conventions.md).
- Use `uv` for Python helpers.

## Testing requirements

- Run `cargo xtask gate` before a PR or hand-off: it auto-formats, then runs invariants, docs-links, lint, and the fast nextest subset. That subset excludes the live-backend and journey tiers; `cargo xtask test -P live` and `cargo xtask test -P journey` are the exact excluded complement.
- Use `cargo xtask test <filter>` for focused iteration; nextest is the only suite runner, so never run bare `cargo test`.
- Run a built `target/.../rimz` against a real multiplexer through `cargo xtask sandbox -- <command>`; the sandbox gives HOME, XDG, tmux, and Zellij disposable roots and tears its mux servers down on exit.
- Escalate to journey, live-backend, performance, dependency gates, or full CI (`cargo xtask ci`) when the change touches those surfaces, their fixtures, or shared infrastructure; instrumented coverage runs through `cargo xtask coverage`.
- CI's `tests` job is the branch-protection check; the pipeline shape (single compile, profile steps, branch protection) lives in [rust-conventions.md](./docs/contributing/rust-conventions.md).
- Keep test tiers separate: unit tests stay in-module and pure, integration tests own subprocess/filesystem behaviour, journey tests own rendered user flows, live-backend tests own real tmux/Zellij, and performance tests assert bounded resource use.
- A module's unit tests have one home: inline `#[cfg(test)] mod tests`, or a sibling `tests.rs` past the size gate (enforced by `cargo xtask invariants`). Minimal usage examples live as unit tests. Shape and threshold in [rust-conventions.md](./docs/contributing/rust-conventions.md).
- Do not land ignored tests for future product targets. Capture planned behaviour in the owning doc, then add the executable test when the implementation can make it pass under nextest.
- Grep-style invariants (`cargo xtask invariants`) guard the architectural boundaries — decision-channel integrity, sidebar/store separation, the trust hash, pane-primitive use, and more.

## Code map

RimZ ships as one Rust binary: the `rimz` crate is CLI, domain library, and native sidebar renderer, with `rimz-presence-zellij` a standalone Zellij wasm plugin beside it. This indexes what lives where; runtime shape and the single-binary rationale live in [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md), and each module's `//!` header is the per-file authority.

**Repository** — `crates/rimz/` (the binary plus the runtime/domain library; `benches/`, and `presence/`/`pricing/`/`themes/` data `build.rs` embeds), `crates/rimz-presence-zellij/` (headless Zellij presence plugin, wasm32-wasip1, no rimz-crate deps), `docs/` (product and engineering docs; `docs/externals/` mirrors upstream), `xtask/` (task runner and every gate), `examples/`, `ci/`, `scripts/`, `supply-chain/`.

**Subsystems — `crates/rimz/src/`**, each carrying its own `AGENTS.md` contract:
- `cli/` — command parsing, one `run(...)` per subcommand, shared `cli/render/` output.
- `agents/` — the provider-neutral `AgentDefinition` catalog, caller-aligned capability contracts and services, `state.rs` rollup, private `adapters/` implementations for every built-in and process plugin, and shared spend/pricing/account machinery.
- `room/` — private managed-room context, birth/reset lifecycle, sidebar/presence options, and health gating.
- `harness/` — layout IR, teams, address grammar, launch argv, supervised runs and their wake socket, loop scheduling, resume planning, and rebirth recovery inspection/materialization.
- `message/` — durable per-agent message queue: park-vs-live dispatch, live-pane send, scheduled wakeups.
- `store/` — durable state engine: framed event log, message/run stores, snapshot rebuild, wakeups, GC.
- `mux/` — Zellij/tmux seam: `MuxBackend`, subprocess engine, reconcile planner, recovery.
- `sidebar/` — data plane: Zellij presence ingestion, producer election, pulled-truth/event fusion, projection fold, heavy-lane refresh.
- `sidebar_pane/` — native renderer process: serve loop, pets, and the ratatui theme/component edge.
- `remote/` — SSH grammar, reconnect policy, link health, `remote.toml`.
- `diag/` — diagnostic-only JSONL append surfaces.

**Top-level modules** — identity and reach (`workspace`, `web`, `channel`, `worktree`, `disk_usage`, `forge`); transcript/panes/seams (`transcript`, `pane`, `sock`, `ids`, `trust`); shared presentation (`theme` semantic palette, provider identity, glyph resolution and setup probes, and value formats); daemon view (`daemon_view` spec and reconciliation, `daemon_content` supervisors, `remote_control` provider-neutral readiness/toggle coordination); process and config (`config`, `observability`, `agent_activity`, `lane`, `proc`, `reload`, `osc`, `build_id`, `child_process`, `tui`, `testkit`).
