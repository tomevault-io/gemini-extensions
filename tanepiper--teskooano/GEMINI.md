# User Coding and Style preferences

You are an agent tasked with helping the user build a new application.

## 📏 Tools and Rules

This is a set of rules and conventions you should always follow - check to see if you are already working with these set up (e.g. in a monorepo)

- Prefered languages and tools:
    - `proto` and `moon` for monorepo dependency management
    - TypeScript for all Frontend and Backend applications
    - Vanilla CSS - no frameworks or additional tooling is needed for styling
    - Node, JavaScript React apps with ESM Module style code
    - Clean and portable bash code for shell scripts and other utilities (especially where installing a lot of dependencies via npm would not make sense )
    - For Frontend, unless asked use React as the frontend framework - set up with vite and vitest.  Here are the versions you should use:
```
     "dependencies": {
        "react": "18.3.1",
        "react-dom": "18.3.1",
        "react-router-dom": "7.1.5"
     }
     "devDependencies": {
            "@testing-library/jest-dom": "6.6.3",
            "@testing-library/react": "16.2.0",
            "@testing-library/user-event": "14.6.1",
            "@types/react": "18.3.18",
            "@types/react-dom": "18.3.5",
            "@vitejs/plugin-react": "4.3.4",
            "happy-dom": "16.8.1",
            "typescript": "5.7.3",
            "vite": "6.0.11",
            "vitest": "3.0.5"
     }
```
    - For Backend, unless asked used expressjs. Here are the versions you should use:
```
    "dependencies": {
        "body-parser": "1.20.3",
        "cors": "2.8.5",
        "express": "4.21.2",
        "express-rate-limit": "7.5.0"
    }
     "devDependencies": {
        "@types/body-parser": "1.19.5",
        "@types/cors": "2.8.17"
        "@types/express": "4.17.21",
        "@types/node": "22.13.10",
     }
```

## ✋ Your Behaviour

These are things you should do at all times to meet the users needs

- Do not hallucinate
- Do not ruminate or overexplain a feature - when building someting, keep it concise and neat and keep to a small number of features, do not keep adding more
- Loop no more than 3 times on a problem before asking for the users help, explain the problem and show them your suggested changes
- Avoid changing settings values like urls or names. For example if you set a port number, and the user changes it - assume the user knows what they are doing
- Be sure a dependency exists like library on npm exists - don't dream one up
- Where possible, when you do something complex you should create a markdown file to explain it
- Use mermaid diagrams to visualise the concept with a complete description


## 👍 Code preferences

- Always use 2 spaces for intentation of any code format
- Avoid rewriting configuration values, especially if a user has changed them 
- Always prefer smaller composable files over larger ones, but try keep the files logical and tidy.  If you see existing code not following these conventions feel free to refactor it. When writing and modularising code:

    - Keep files to a maximum of 300-400 lines of code - If you do end up writing a large file, immediatly split it down.
    - Focus on moving functions that can easily be put in a utility or library file (for example long handler functions in React components, or complex processing of data)
    - Break down large pieces of HTML or JSX into smaller leaf components that have boundaries of only taking data or return data via props (these components can have functionality but should be isolated and testable)
    - Take a Model-View-Controller approach to frontend components, breaking down routes and views into smaller parts with a controller, and connecting with a datasource model

## 🧪 Testing

- When writing a file, it should be accompanied by a test file in the same folder:  For example where a code file is <filename>.ts the unit test should always be <filename>.spec.ts

    - Write unit tests for vitest, both for backend and frontend code.
    - For frontend apps:
        - Use Playwrite for user story and integration testing
        - Tests should be practical UI tests or complex features of the app
        - Avoid testing DOM or library features
        - If a unit test requires JSDOM, instead write it to run in Playwrite
    - For backend apps:
        - Use Playwrite for automated testing for API test cases
        - Tests should be practical 

## 🎁 Monorepo Approach

- Check to see if you are already working in a monorepo

## `proto`

- Use `proto` for any repository that is set up, this sets up a local copy of system dependencies like `node` and `npm` for this repo only, giving consistancy.  Here is a starter `.protofile`:

```
jq = "1.7.1"
moon = "1.31.2"
node = "22.13.0"
npm = "11.0.0"

[plugins]
jq = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/appthrust/proto-toml-plugins/main/jq/plugin.toml"
moon = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonrepo/moon/master/proto-plugin.toml"
```

- Once created, run `proto use`

## `moon`

- Use `moon` for repo management and ensure you add a `moon.yml` file to each project, the stucture should be:

    - apps: Applications that have a frontend component
    - packages: libraries and other features
    - services: backend services that can be containerised

```
- monorepo-root
    - README.md
    - package.json # monorepo package json - use workspaces here
    - tsconfig.json # monorepo compatible typescript setup with paths
    - apps
        - app1
            - src
            - package.json
            - moon.yml
            - tsconfig.json
            - vite.config.ts
        - app2
    - packages
        - library1
            - src
            - package.json
            - moon.yml
            - tsconfig.json
            - vite.config.ts
        - library2
    - services
        - rest-service-1
            - src
            - package.json
            - moon.yml
            - tsconfig.json
        - graphql-service-1
```

- Only use `npm` for node dependencies, do not use any alternative package manager
- Use `tsx` to run typescript scripts directly (e.g. `npx tsx src/index.ts`)

## 🌈 Frontend Apps and Libraries

### Applications

- Put the frontend application in the `apps` folder, and run on port 3000
- When starting a project, use React with React Router
- When writing a complex component, break it down into the smallest code possible, that make sense to unit test - avoid large files, especially over 400 lines.
    - When writing JSX or HTML - If there is a loop or logic, put this into it's own component
    - When writing functional code - put complex loops or logic into their own component
- Use React Router to define the controller components for that particular view, and build up views from smaller (ideally reusable) components
- Write unit test with vitest. Always create spec tests next to files - as an example where a code file is <filename>.ts the test should always be <filename>.spec.ts.
- DO NOT use tailwind css - if you encounter tailwind css you should offer to provide a vanilla css implementation instead and create the file, you are free to to use sass if it help, but keep the syntax vanilla
- Create a general set of design system tokens for a project so that it has some consistant design, offer to provide design system components if appropriate

### Libraries

- When writing libraries, put these in the `packages` folder - libraries should be exportable and the correct typescript and vite setup in place to load these libraries
- Use typescript to build libraries

## 🚢 Backend Services and Features

### Applications

- Put the backend app in `services`, and run on port 3001
- Use expressjs as a base for all backend projects - set up with cors and body-parser and a basic route
- When writing a complex component, break it down into the code components possible, that make sense to unit test - avoid large files.  Use 
- Write unit test with vitest. Always create spec tests next to files - as an example where a code file is <filename>.ts the test should always be <filename>.spec.ts.

### Libraries

- You can also put backend libaries in packages, but here only extract them if it makes sense to make them reusable, otherwise leave them in the application
