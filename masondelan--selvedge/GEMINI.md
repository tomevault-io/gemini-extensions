# CLAUDE.md — Selvedge agent instructions

This file is auto-loaded by Claude Code and Cowork on every session. It's the rules and conventions agents follow when working on Selvedge.

For everything else:

- **[`README.md`](README.md)** — user-facing docs (install, quickstart, comparison, "what's new", CLI reference)
- **[`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md)** — internal architecture, data model, MCP tool reference, CLI reference, full phase plan, non-goals
- **[`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md)** — source of truth for what's actually shipped

---

## Sources of truth

- **What's shipped** → `CHANGELOG.md`. The phase-plan checkboxes in `docs/architecture.md` can drift; trust the changelog when they disagree.
- **Current MCP tool count and shape** → `selvedge/server.py`. Don't infer from `manifest.json` — the bundle can lag the live server.
- **Version string** → `pyproject.toml` AND `selvedge/__init__.py` AND `manifest.json` must all match.

---

## Code conventions

- **No external dependencies beyond the declared ones.** Keep the install footprint small.
- **No LLM calls inside Selvedge core.** Templated, deterministic output only. When a feature design is tempted toward an LLM hop, the PR description must explain how the templated output covers the user need; reviewers reject "we'll add an LLM later if needed." See `docs/architecture.md` cross-cutting risk register for the full rationale.
- **SQLite first, always.** Don't reach for Postgres until Phase 3. SQLite with WAL handles concurrent reads fine.
- **`ChangeEvent` is a dataclass, not Pydantic.** Keep the core dependency-free. MCP serialization uses `to_dict()`.
- **New TypedDict result types must justify themselves.** Before introducing a new MCP tool result shape, check whether an existing one (`LogChangeResult`, `BlameResult`, the auto-generated list-shapes) extends to fit. Prefer extending an existing type to introducing a new one. Every field always populated, never `null` — same convention as `LogChangeResult` / `BlameResult` (empty string / empty list / empty dict for "absent").
- **Every public function has a docstring.** The MCP tool docstrings in `server.py` are user-facing — they appear in agent tool listings and propagate into `manifest.json`.
- **Tests use `tmp_path` fixtures and `SELVEDGE_DB` env var.** Never write to the real DB in tests.
- **Rich for all terminal output.** No bare `print()` in `cli.py`.
- **`--json` flag on every read command.** Machine-readable output is a first-class concern.
- **Type hints everywhere.** Python 3.10+ syntax (`X | Y`, `list[dict]`, etc.).
- **Destructive actions require both interactive consent AND environment-level opt-in.** Any command that can delete events from the store (e.g. `selvedge prune --include-events`, landing in v0.3.10 alongside `.selvedge/config.toml`) must require BOTH a confirmation prompt AND `SELVEDGE_DESTRUCTIVE=1` in the environment. Defends against the cron / non-interactive `--yes` footgun.

---

## Test suite

Tests live in `tests/`. Run with `pytest` from the repo root.

- `test_storage.py` — storage layer
- `test_server.py` — MCP tools (in-process)
- `test_cli.py` — CLI commands
- `test_importers.py` — migration parsers (SQL DDL + Alembic)
- `test_adversarial.py` — locks in the v0.3.0 correctness fixes
- `test_concurrency.py` — multi-threaded writers
- `test_public_api.py` — frozen `__init__.py` surface
- `test_mcp_protocol.py` — boots real `selvedge-server` subprocess and round-trips every tool over stdio

Each phase has a soft test-budget target (see the cross-cutting risk register in `docs/architecture.md`). When a phase exceeds its budget, the release notes call out *why* — typically a perf-regression suite or a new protocol smoke test. The HTTP layer in v0.4.0 must ship with `test_http_protocol.py` parallel to `test_mcp_protocol.py` — release-blocker, not optional.

Never write to the real DB in tests — always set `SELVEDGE_DB` to a `tmp_path` fixture.

## Version bump checklist

When the user asks for a version bump:

1. Update `pyproject.toml` AND `selvedge/__init__.py` AND `manifest.json` AND `server.json` AND `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` (all five must match — `server.json` is the official MCP Registry manifest (2025-12-11 schema) and carries the version **twice**: top-level `version` and `packages[0].version`, bump both; it missed v0.3.3 entirely, see CHANGELOG; the CI registry job also syncs both fields from the tag as a backstop. `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` is the Claude Code plugin descriptor added in v0.3.7).
2. **Run `pytest`, `ruff check`, AND `mypy selvedge/` locally** — the GitHub Actions lint job runs all three, and a CI-only mypy failure means your CI badge goes red post-publish (happened on v0.3.4 with the `ToolAnnotations` dict→model issue). Catch it on your machine first.
3. Tag the commit; the PyPI publish workflow runs on tag push (OIDC trusted publisher is pinned to the workflow filename — don't rename that file without updating PyPI config first). After the PyPI job succeeds, the `publish-mcp-registry` job in the same workflow publishes/updates the listing on the official MCP Registry (`registry.modelcontextprotocol.io`) — no manual step.
4. For Smithery: hand-zip the bundle (NOT `mcpb pack` — there's an MCPB-vs-Smithery schema mismatch around per-tool `inputSchema`), then `smithery mcp publish`.
5. Add a "What's new in vX.Y.Z" section to `README.md`. Cap at 2 versions — oldest drops off stack-style (so v0.3.2 ship → v0.3.0 drops).
6. **Propagate to `masondelan/selvedge-site`.** Open a PR (or direct commit) on the site repo: bump any displayed version string, mirror the README "What's new" content into the site's release-notes page, and revise prose that references behavior that changed in this release. The codebase repo is the source of truth for *what* shipped; the site is the source of truth for *how it's described*. Both must move together. See `docs/architecture.md` § "Website ↔ codebase sync" for the discipline rule and the open follow-up to evaluate auto-PR automation. If the release introduces no user-facing narrative shift, the PR description on the codebase side must say "Site sync: version-only" explicitly — no silent skips.

---

## Release notes

- Pull content from `CHANGELOG.md`. Group into Added / Changed / Fixed sections.
- The MCP tool docstrings in `server.py` are user-facing — keep them accurate after any tool changes.

---

## Phase plan maintenance

The phase plan lives in `docs/architecture.md`.

- Source of truth for shipped work is `CHANGELOG.md`, not the phase checkboxes.
- When asked to update the phase plan, read `CHANGELOG.md` and `selvedge/server.py` (for current tool count/names) and compare against the checkboxes. Mark anything shipped as done.

## Idea capture pipeline

Good ideas raised in chats must not evaporate when the session ends — capture them. This is Selvedge's own thesis (intent that lives only in chat history is lost intent) applied to our own workflow.

- **What counts:** any concrete, non-trivial Selvedge idea (feature, doc, positioning, infra, content angle) that surfaces in a chat. Off-topic / non-Selvedge ideas stay out. When in doubt, capture — Mason can say "log that" to force one in or "skip" to drop one.
- **Where:** the canonical store is the **Notion [💡 Ideas](https://app.notion.com/p/a8df61ca062345b59de59e71bca6313b) database** (in the "Selvedge — Internal" hub). Add a row directly, or use its **"Submit an idea"** form tab. `docs/ideas-backlog.json` is now **export/seed only** — its `_comment` / `status_legend` still document the lifecycle, but new ideas are authored in Notion. Field convention is unchanged: every field always populated, never `null` (empty string / empty list for absent).
- **At capture time:** create the Notion row with `Status = Captured`, the `Captured` date, `Source`, a one-line `Summary`, and a `Rationale`. Leave the research block (in the page body) empty — the weekly regen fills it. Don't research at capture time unless Mason asks.
- **Lifecycle:** `captured` → `researched` (weekly enrich pass) → `promoted` (onto the work board / plays; `promoted_to` names the slot) | `parked` | `dropped`. Parked and dropped ideas stay on the record with a reason, so a defer is visible and not re-litigated from zero.
- **Surfacing:** the `selvedge-weekly-dashboard` task enriches new `Captured` ideas (the Notion Ideas DB) and renders them in the "ideas / research backlog" section of `docs/dashboard.html`. This stays a **Cowork scheduled task** — the Notion Plus + AI plan has no Custom Agents, so there is no Notion-native agent for the enrich pass. See `docs/dashboard-task-prompt.md`.

---

## Scheduled recurring tasks (managed by Cowork)

- **Weekly phase-plan drift check** — compare `CHANGELOG.md` against the phase plan in `docs/architecture.md` and flag any shipped items still showing as unchecked.
- **Weekly coverage report** — run `scripts/coverage_check.py` against the git log and report the `log_change` call ratio per commit.
- **Weekly idea backlog enrich + render** — part of the `selvedge-weekly-dashboard` run: research new `Captured` ideas in the Notion [💡 Ideas](https://app.notion.com/p/a8df61ca062345b59de59e71bca6313b) database, promote/park as warranted, and render the "ideas / research backlog" dashboard section. Stays a Cowork task — no Notion Custom Agents on the Plus plan. See "Idea capture pipeline" above.
- **Notion hub mirror (`notion-sync` GitHub Action — not Cowork).** The 🗺️ Roadmap and 🚀 Releases databases in the "Selvedge — Internal" Notion hub are *mirrors* of `docs/architecture.md` and `CHANGELOG.md`, kept current by `scripts/notion_sync.py` via `.github/workflows/notion-sync.yml` (on release, on push to `main` touching those two files, daily, or manual). Repo stays canonical for what shipped — never edit those two Notion DBs by hand. Ideas / Decisions / Distribution are Notion-primary (authored in Notion, not synced). This is the Plus-compatible replacement for Notion Workers (Business/Enterprise only).
