## forge-site

> Blueprint system for agent-driven client site builds. Structured documentation that humans and AI agents consume to deliver client sites from proven patterns — no runtime, no build step. The single exception: `scripts/compile-prompt.mjs`, a dependency-free helper that fills a generation prompt's mechanical slots from a brand-kit and gates a filled prompt before it ships to an engine. Everything else is read, not executed.

# forge-site

Blueprint system for agent-driven client site builds. Structured documentation that humans and AI agents consume to deliver client sites from proven patterns — no runtime, no build step. The single exception: `scripts/compile-prompt.mjs`, a dependency-free helper that fills a generation prompt's mechanical slots from a brand-kit and gates a filled prompt before it ships to an engine. Everything else is read, not executed.

## What This Is

forge-site codifies a repeatable "renovation" process for building client websites:
1. **Recon** — discover what the client needs
2. **Diagnose** — match them to a proven business archetype
3. **Prescribe** — select modules from a tested library
4. **Renovate** — agents scaffold and build using specchain + forge family tools
5. **Handoff** — deliver the site with CMS access, dashboards, and docs

## How to Use

### For a new client engagement:
1. Read `playbook/1-recon.md` — run discovery questions with the client
2. Read `playbook/2-diagnose.md` — match client to an archetype using the decision tree
3. Read `playbook/3-prescribe.md` — select modules, fill out the prescription YAML
4. Copy the matching `templates/*.yml` to the new project's specchain
5. Customize the template with client-specific details
6. In the new project: `/new-spec` → `/create-spec` → `/implement-spec`
7. Read `playbook/4-renovate.md` for the agent execution workflow
8. Read `playbook/5-handoff.md` for what to deliver to the client

### For validating forge-site against an existing project:
1. Run the playbook retroactively (recon → diagnose → prescribe)
2. Compare the prescription against what was actually built
3. Score the match and patch any gaps into the archetype/module docs

## Five Archetypes

| Archetype | Description | Reference Projects |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Service Business** | Local providers needing web presence + leads | Allen Wellness Center, Creative Floors |
| **Event Organizer** | Selling registrations, managing live events | Volley Rx, Let's Pepper, Rally HQ |
| **Digital Content** | Selling access to videos, courses, downloads | Rally HQ (billing), Urvil Performance |
| **Portfolio/Brand** | Personal or business brand with media focus | Photography, website-nc, FlickDay |
| **Publication** | Free, ungated editorial publication under one voice | Signal Dispatch v1/v2 |

Each archetype has two variants (e.g., service-business has person-centric and project-centric). Read the archetype doc for variant details.

## The Forge Family

forge-site orchestrates these sibling tools in `~/Workspace/dev/tools/`:

| Tool | Role | CLI |
|------|------|-----|
| **specchain** | Requirements → spec → tasks → implementation | `bash setup.sh ./project` then `/new-spec` |
| **brand-forge** | Brand identity (colors, typography, tokens) | `npx brand-forge init` |
| **signal-forge** | Site copy and content generation | `npx signal-forge generate` |
| **image-gen** | Hero images, social cards, media assets | `npx image-gen generate` |
| **claude-docs-toolkit** | Handoff documentation | `/init-docs` (slash command) |

See `playbook/4-renovate.md` for exact CLI commands and execution order.

## Validation History

forge-site has been validated against these completed projects:

| Project | Archetype | Score | Gaps Found & Patched |
|---------|-----------|-------|---------------------|
| Allen Wellness Center | Service Business (person-centric) | 95% → 98% | insuranceProvider schema, booking system check, enhanced AEO fields |
| Creative Floors | Service Business (project-centric) | 97% → 99% | beforeAfter object, per-area project counts, WebSite JSON-LD |

## Key Conventions

- Archetype docs reference real file paths in `~/Workspace/dev/` — verify paths still exist before recommending
- Module docs include specific integration patterns and gotchas, not generic advice
- The playbook is process documentation, not code — read it, don't execute it
- Templates: `*.yml` for specchain consumption; `site-*-prompt.md` are compiled-prompt scaffolds (generation for greenfield, remediation for existing sites — see the fork in `playbook/4-renovate.md`)
- Structural anti-fabrication (see `ARCHITECTURE.md`): constraints that an engine could violate plausibly need a mechanism (whitelist, manifest, executable check), not another instruction sentence
- Before handing a filled generation prompt to an engine: `node scripts/compile-prompt.mjs check <prompt.md>`
- forge-site improves with each validation run — patch gaps when found
