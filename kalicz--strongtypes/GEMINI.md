# StrongTypes — Coding Conventions

## Audience

This repository has multiple contributors. Do not rely on per-user memory,
personal preferences, or prior-session context when working here. Every
convention that matters belongs in this file (or in the code itself) so that
every collaborator — human or AI — sees the same rules.

**Do not write to the external memory system** (`~/.claude/projects/…` or
any similar per-user scratch space). No project memories, no feedback
memories, no references — nothing. If something is worth remembering
about this repo, it goes in this file so it travels with the code and
every contributor sees it.

## C# conventions

- **Primary constructors** — use them wherever possible (classes, `DbContext`
  subclasses, test fixtures, etc.).

## Folder layout — feature slices

Organize code by feature, not by technical role. An extension, a JSON
converter, and the main type for the same feature live together in the
feature's folder:

- `src/StrongTypes/Strings/NonEmptyString.cs`
- `src/StrongTypes/Strings/NonEmptyStringExtensions.cs`
- `src/StrongTypes/Strings/NonEmptyStringJsonConverter.cs`
- `src/StrongTypes/Maybe/MaybeExtensions.cs`

Extensions that *produce* a feature type go into that feature's folder
even when the input type is from somewhere else (e.g. `ToMaybe` on `T?`
lives under `Maybe/`, because the result — not the receiver — is what
defines the slice).

Namespaces stay flat at `StrongTypes` regardless of folder nesting. Folder
structure is for humans; the namespace is one flat shelf. The same applies
to the test project — keep tests in `namespace StrongTypes.Tests` even
when they live in subfolders, to avoid shadowing type names (e.g., a
nested `StrongTypes.Tests.Maybe` namespace would hide the
`StrongTypes.Maybe<T>` type from sibling files).

## Validated types — the TryCreate / Create pattern

For types that enforce a validation rule (e.g., `NonEmptyString`,
`PositiveInt`), follow this factory pattern:

```csharp
// Returns null when validation fails. Caller handles the null case.
public static NonEmptyString? TryCreate(string? value) { ... }

// Throws when validation fails. Thin wrapper over TryCreate.
public static NonEmptyString Create(string? value)
    => TryCreate(value) ?? throw new ArgumentException(...);
```

Rules:
- The validation logic lives in `TryCreate` only. `Create` delegates.
- Constructors are `private` — callers must go through the factories.
- Use nullable reference types.

## Tests

All testing rules — unit, API / ASP.NET Core / OpenAPI integration,
configuration binding, WPF, and analyzer tests — live in
[`testing.md`](testing.md). **Read that file
before writing or modifying a test, and before writing any code that
will need tests** (a new strong type, a converter, an analyzer, an API
endpoint, …). It is the single source of truth; do not infer testing
conventions from existing tests without checking it first.

**One shared CRUD surface (don't reintroduce drift):** the API CRUD/PATCH
suite's create/get/update/PATCH scenarios live exactly once, in the abstract
`EntityCrudTestsBase`, so the scalar and interval wire shapes cannot drift. Its
two thin adapters — `EntityTests` (scalar wire) and `IntervalEntityTests`
(object wire) — add only wire-shape-specific pieces (bodies, the read assertion,
invalid-payload cases). A new shared scenario goes in `EntityCrudTestsBase`, not
in an adapter. See the "One shared CRUD surface" section of
[`testing.md`](testing.md) and the XML docs on `EntityCrudTestsBase` and its two
adapters.

## Skill — keep it in sync

The `Skill/` directory ships a Claude / Codex skill that teaches the
agent how to use this library in *consumer* projects (not this repo).
It's distributed as a release asset and lives entirely inside `Skill/`:

- `Skill/SKILL.md` — top-level guide, package table, decision trees,
  anti-patterns.
- `Skill/references/*.md` — per-feature references loaded on demand.

**Update it whenever the library's user-facing surface changes.** That
includes:

- Adding a new package — add a row to the `Packages` table in
  `SKILL.md`, add a row to "Helpers and integrations", and create a
  `Skill/references/<package>.md` covering when to use it, when not
  to use it, and the wiring snippet.
- Adding a new strong type — add a row to the appropriate type
  catalog table and either extend an existing reference or add a new
  one.
- Changing wiring (extension method names, registration calls) or
  package compatibility (target frameworks, dependency versions) —
  update the affected reference file *and* any `SKILL.md` snippet
  that mentions it.
- Changing the recommended pattern for something the skill calls out
  (decision trees, anti-patterns) — update the corresponding section
  of `SKILL.md`.

The skill must work standalone; it can't assume the reader has the
repository handy. Keep snippets self-contained and copy real examples
from passing tests where possible.

## StrongTypes.Api — purpose

An ASP.NET Core minimal API that exists purely as an integration-test
harness: it verifies that strong types round-trip correctly through the
ASP.NET Core request pipeline and EF Core against both SQL Server and
PostgreSQL (via Testcontainers). Every write endpoint persists to both
`DbContext`s and every read endpoint reads from one specific provider,
so tests can assert the full wire-to-DB path on each.

Because writes hit both `DbContext`s, the harness needs both providers
present. PostgreSQL is always required; SQL Server is required too, except
that a host may opt into skipping it when the amd64-only image won't start
— see the "SQL Server availability and skipping" section of
[`testing.md`](testing.md). Absent the opt-in, a SQL Server that fails to
start is always a hard failure, never a silent skip.

## Comments — XML and `//`

**XML comments** (`/// <summary>`, `<param>`, `<remarks>`, …) are for
the **caller**. Nothing else belongs in them.

- **Describe caller-facing behavior only** — what the member does, what
  it returns, what makes it throw, what invariants it upholds. That is
  information the caller cannot get from the signature alone.
- **No implementation commentary.** Do not explain that a method
  delegates to LINQ, dispatches via a runtime type check, uses
  `CollectionsMarshal.AsSpan`, reaches `Buffer.Memmove`, caches via the
  `field` keyword, is structured that way for variance reasons, etc.
  None of that helps the caller; it ages badly when the implementation
  changes, and it pollutes IntelliSense.
- **No rationale for why two overloads exist, why a converter is a
  factory, why the type is sealed**, and similar "design notes."
- **If the member name already says it, skip the XML.** A one-liner
  summary that just restates the method name is noise. Only add a
  summary when it tells the caller something non-obvious (edge cases,
  null handling, thrown exceptions, ordering guarantees).
- **`<remarks>` is for additional caller-facing contract**, not for
  essays on internals. If the remark would read like a changelog entry
  or a code review comment, delete it.

**`//` comments are not a messaging channel for future contributors.**
If you want to explain a design choice, leave a note about a workaround,
justify why the code isn't "obviously simpler," or tell the next person
why two overloads exist — that belongs in the commit message or the PR
description, not in the source. Code comments should not read like
letters to a programmer.

Use `//` only for things the code itself cannot say:

- A short `// TODO:` tied to a tracking issue.
- A one-word marker flagging a non-obvious invariant the very next line
  relies on (`// caller already validated`).
- A pragma-style note pointing at an external cause (`// workaround
  for dotnet/runtime#12345`).

If you catch yourself writing an explanatory paragraph in `//`, stop.
Either the code needs to be clearer, or the context belongs in the
commit message where it's searchable via `git log` / `git blame`.

## Pull requests

- **Always assign the person running the session** when opening a PR.
  Use the GitHub `get_me` tool to discover the authenticated user.

## Style

- Prefer `Edit` over rewriting whole files.
- Keep public API changes minimal and documented.
- Do not add files, abstractions, or configurability beyond what the task asks for.
- **Line wrapping** — `.editorconfig` sets `max_line_length`. Don't
  pre-emptively wrap expressions, lambdas, method chains, or `throw`
  statements that fit within that limit; one-liners are preferred over
  mechanical wrapping at arbitrary thresholds. Only wrap when a line
  actually exceeds `max_line_length`.
- **Expression-bodied members** — keep them on a single line whenever
  they fit within `max_line_length`. That applies to expression-bodied
  methods, properties, getters, constructors, and local functions
  (`=>` form). Don't break `=>` onto its own line or split the body
  across multiple lines; if the result genuinely doesn't fit, switch
  to a block body (`{ ... }`) rather than a wrapped expression body.
