## Agent Skills

Reusable skill references live in `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. Always check this folder before reaching for external docs — skills contain curated quick references and gotchas specific to tools used in this repo.

Available skills:

- **`.agents/skills/bun/`** — Bun runtime, package manager, test runner, and bundler. Covers `bun run`, `bun install`, `bun test`, `bun build`, workspace flags, common gotchas (flag placement, lifecycle scripts, lockfile format), and key APIs (`Bun.file()`, `Bun.serve()`, `Bun.write()`)
- **`.agents/skills/alineo/`** — the `alineo` agent SDK (load/resume/attach/spawn, prompt/bash streaming, session control) and the `alineo-cli`: agent lifecycle, storage adapters, and Windows-specific gotchas.

Example: before writing a `bun build` command or debugging a workspace install issue, read `.agents/skills/bun/SKILL.md` for the correct flags and known pitfalls.

External agents install either skill with the [Skills CLI](https://skills.sh): `npx skills add DrejT/alineo --skill <name>`.

## What this is

`alineo` is an AI agent platform built on sandboxed execution. `@alineo-labs/sandbox` is the
**sandbox execution substrate** built on top of [OpenSandbox](https://opensandbox.ai) — it gives
you live sandbox containers as first-class objects (spawn, exec, checkpoint, resume) with a
durable SQL audit ledger and replay. `alineo` (the bare package name) is the agent SDK built on
top of it — it runs Pi coding agents inside those sandboxes. Workflow primitives (retry, when,
forEach, parallel) live in the separate `@alineo-labs/workflow` package.

## Commands

```bash
# Run an example (requires OpenSandbox server — use alineo init or uvx opensandbox-server)
bun examples/hello-world/index.ts

# Run all unit tests
bun run test

# Build the SDK for publishing (generates dist/ across all packages)
bun run build

# Typecheck all packages
bun run typecheck

# `test`/`build`/`typecheck` are driven by scripts/workspace-run.ts, which auto-discovers
# every package under the root package.json's "workspaces" array (topologically sorted by
# "workspace:*" dependency edges) — a new package is picked up the moment it's added there
# and has the relevant tsconfig.json/package.json script, with no second place to register
# it. To typecheck one package in isolation while iterating:
bunx tsc --noEmit --strict --project packages/<name>/tsconfig.json

# Changesets (required on every PR touching publishable packages)
bunx changeset        # add a changeset
bunx changeset status # verify one exists

# IMPORTANT: after committing code changes, always add and commit a changeset too.
# The CI changeset check (bunx changeset status --since origin/main) reads from
# git history — an uncommitted changeset file will NOT satisfy it.
```

## Testing

### Two test layers

**Unit tests** live in `packages/*/test/*.test.ts` and run via `bun test`. They test internal builder logic, control-flow, and adapter behaviour in isolation — no sandbox required.

**Integration tests** live in `tests/integration/<name>.test.ts` (one `@alineo-labs/integration-tests` workspace, not co-located with each example) and run via `bun run test:integration` from the repo root, or `cd tests/integration && bun test <name>.test.ts` for one file. They use `bun:test`'s `test()`/`expect()` against a real OpenSandbox sandbox — largely mirroring what the matching `examples/<name>/index.ts` demonstrates, but with real assertions instead of `console.log`. Most (not all) examples have one; `scripts/new-example.ts` scaffolds a stub alongside a new example.

`examples/<name>/index.ts` itself is also directly runnable (`bun examples/<name>/index.ts`) as a human-readable demo — the two are complementary, not duplicates: the example is what a user reads/copies, the test is what CI would assert on.

### Integration test conventions

- **Run with**: `bun run test:integration` from the repo root, or `cd tests/integration && bun test` for the whole suite / `bun test <name>.test.ts` for one file.
- **Requires**: OpenSandbox server running locally — either `alineo init` (Docker-based, recommended) or `uvx opensandbox-server` (manual). If using `alineo init`, pass `useServerProxy: true` to `new Sandbox(...)` so the SDK routes through the server instead of container-direct IPs.
- **Client setup**: `new Sandbox({ baseUrl: ..., adapter: new SQLiteAdapter(":memory:") })` — no `connect()` or `close()` needed on the client itself.
- **Sandbox lifecycle**: always wrap in `try/finally { await sb.close(); }` to avoid container leaks.
- **Assertion**: `const { stdout, exitCode } = await sb.exec("cmd")` — assert on the returned value. For error cases, catch `CommandError`.

### What to assert

Assert on observable behaviour, not internal structure:
- `await sb.exec("cmd")` result: `stdout`, `stderr`, `exitCode`
- `await sb.readFile("/path")` content
- error class and `.exitCode` for `CommandError` cases

```

### Key design points

**Sandbox as first-class object**: `client.sandbox()` returns a live `SandboxHandle` object. You hold it, call methods on it, and call `sb.close()` when done. Multiple sandboxes → multiple variables. No special API.

**ExecHandle**: `sb.exec("cmd")` returns an `ExecHandle` — a `PromiseLike<ExecResult>` with `pipe()`, `stdout()`, and `result()`. `await sb.exec("cmd")` gives `{ stdout, stderr, exitCode }`. Streaming: `await sb.exec("cmd").pipe(process.stdout)`.

**Durable ledger**: Every exec is logged to the adapter as `exec_start` → `exec_event`s → `exec_complete`. `sb.checkpoint()` snapshots the container and writes `checkpoint_created`. On `client.resume(sandboxId)`: restores from the last snapshot, returns cached results for execs completed before the checkpoint, runs the rest live. Invisible to the user.

**Lazy workflow layer**: `@alineo-labs/workflow` provides `workflow(client).sandbox(opts, fn).pipe(sink)`. The `fn` callback receives a `SandboxBuilder` — all methods queue ops synchronously. The queue is flushed when `.pipe()` or `.result()` is awaited. One `await` at the end regardless of workflow complexity.

**Storage adapter**: `SandboxClientOptions.adapter` accepts any `IStorageAdapter`. Pass `new SQLiteAdapter("./alineo.db")` for local dev or `new PostgresAdapter(connectionString)` for production. The adapter is initialised lazily on first use — no `connect()` call needed. On process exit, `beforeExit` closes the adapter automatically; explicit teardown is not required for scripts.

**Concurrency limits**: `SandboxClientOptions.maxConcurrency` caps simultaneous active sandboxes. `client.sandbox()` awaits a semaphore slot; the slot is released when `sb.close()` is called.

**Hooks**: `SandboxHooks` provides lifecycle callbacks: `onSandboxCreated`, `onExecStart`, `onExecComplete`, `onCheckpoint`, `onSandboxClosed`, `onSandboxFailed`. Pass via `SandboxOptions.hooks`. Use `otelHooks(tracer)` from `@alineo-labs/otel` for OpenTelemetry tracing.

**execd readiness**: OpenSandbox reports a sandbox as "Running" before execd is ready. `resolveExecClient()` calls `getEndpoint()` once (each call returns a different ephemeral proxy port) then polls `listContexts()` until execd responds.

**Sandbox entrypoint**: Always `["tail", "-f", "/dev/null"]` — `/bin/bash` exits immediately without a TTY, killing the container. `client.sandbox()` sets this automatically.

**Resource limits required**: `SandboxOptions.resources` (`{ cpu: string; memory: string; gpu?: string }`) is required — the OpenSandbox server rejects requests without it. Always pass at least `{ cpu: "500m", memory: "256Mi" }`. This applies to `client.sandbox()`, `workflow().sandbox()`, and every step in `workflow().sequence()`.

**Server proxy mode**: When OpenSandbox runs in Docker (via `alineo init`), sandbox containers are on a bridge network and their IPs are unreachable from the host. Set `useServerProxy: true` in `SandboxClientOptions` to route execd and proxy traffic through the server (`?use_server_proxy=true` on `getEndpoint`). The server then returns `{eip}/sandboxes/{id}/proxy/{port}` URLs that are reachable from the host. The server config must have `eip = "http://localhost:8080"` set — `alineo init` writes this automatically.

## Environment variables

`Sandbox` is configured via constructor options, not environment variables. The consuming application is responsible for reading env vars and passing them in:

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `baseUrl` | OpenSandbox server URL (e.g. `http://localhost:8080`) |
| `apiKey` | OpenSandbox API key (empty string for local dev) |
| `adapter` | `IStorageAdapter` implementation (SQLiteAdapter or PostgresAdapter) |
| `maxConcurrency` | Max simultaneous workflow runs (default: unlimited) |
| `useServerProxy` | Route execd/proxy traffic through the server — required when server runs in Docker via `alineo init` (default: `false`) |

## Local OpenSandbox setup

### Option 1 — alineo init (recommended)

`bunx alineo-cli init` starts OpenSandbox in a Docker container (`opensandbox/server:latest`) and writes `~/.config/alineo/server.toml` and `.alineo/config.json` automatically. This is the preferred path for users running the full alineo workflow.

When using a server started this way, pass `useServerProxy: true` to `new Sandbox(...)` — direct container IPs are not reachable from the host over Docker's bridge network.

OpenSandbox's snapshot-metadata db is bind-mounted from `~/.config/alineo/opensandbox-data` into the container (see `serverDataDir()` in `packages/cli/src/config.ts`), so `Alineo.load()`'s cached-snapshot fast path survives the container being fully removed and recreated, not just stopped/started — fixes the silent full-rebuild-on-every-restart issue tracked as #20.

### Option 2 — uvx (manual)

Run `uvx opensandbox-server` with `~/.sandbox.toml`:

```toml
[server]
host = "127.0.0.1"
port = 8080

[runtime]
type = "docker"
execd_image = "opensandbox/execd:v1.0.22"

[docker]
network_mode = "bridge"

[ingress]
mode = "direct"

[egress]
mode = "dns"
```

The `uvx` path does not need `useServerProxy` — the server is on the host, so direct container IPs are reachable.

## SDK focus

We are currently focused exclusively on making the **TypeScript sandbox client SDK** (`packages/sdks/typescript`, published as `@alineo-labs/sandbox`) full-featured and production-ready. Python SDK is maintained but not the priority. Do not add new features to the Python SDK unless explicitly asked.

## Releases

The TypeScript sandbox client SDK (`packages/sdks/typescript`, published as `@alineo-labs/sandbox`) is published to npm via changesets, same as every other publishable package (`alineo`, `alineo-cli`, `@alineo-labs/*`). Every PR that changes publishable packages needs a changeset (`bunx changeset`). CI enforces this. Releases are cut automatically via `changesets/action` on merge to `main`.

> **Changeset must be committed** before CI will pass — `bunx changeset status --since origin/main` reads from git history, not disk.

## Docs versioning is decoupled from npm releases — don't assume a version bump updates docs

`apps/docs`'s `core`/`alineo` (CLI) sections are versioned per `plans/versioned-docs.md`, but **bumping the npm package version does nothing to the docs site by itself.** The version registry (`source.config.ts`, `src/lib/source.ts`, `public/_redirects`) is generated from whatever `content/docs/<product>/vX.Y/` folders exist on disk (`apps/docs/scripts/{doc-versions,sync-doc-versions,sync-redirects}.ts`, run via `predev`/`prebuild`) — a version cut is "add the content folder, run `bun run build`", but someone still has to write that content. Folders/`defineDocs()` identifiers keep the `v` prefix (`v0.2`); **URLs drop it** (`/docs/core/0.2`, not `/docs/core/v0.2`).

**Known-bad pattern, hit twice**: a feature PR documents its new API by editing the *current latest* `content/docs/{core,alineo}/vX.Y/` folder in place — fine while nothing has shipped, but the moment that version publishes to npm, `vX.Y` is silently describing `vX.(Y+1)`'s API and `/docs/core` + `/docs/alineo` + `/` (the "latest" redirects in `public/_redirects`) still point at the stale version.

- **First time**: #182's `alineo`/agent naming inversion — `5dcb3de` edited `v0.1` in place instead of cutting `v0.2`. Once #190 published `0.2.0`, `v0.1` described `0.2.0` with no real pre-rename snapshot anywhere but git history. Fixed in `docs/dynamic-version-registry` (PR #193): moved that content to `v0.2`, restored the true pre-rename docs (from `5dcb3de~1`) as `v0.1`.
- **Second time**: #204's credential injection wrote `concepts/credentials.mdx` + edits straight into `v0.2`. Once PR #206 published `@alineo-labs/core@0.3.0`, `v0.2` described `0.3.0` and `/docs/core` still redirected to `0.2`. Fixed in `docs/cut-v0.3` (PR #223): `cp -r v0.2 → v0.3`, repointed the new folder's internal links to `0.3`, let `predev`/`prebuild` regenerate the registry + redirects. `v0.2` left as a frozen snapshot (not scrubbed back to `0.2.0`).

**This is now guarded (PR #225).** The docs "epoch" — the `vX.Y` number on *both* the `core` and `alineo` trees, cut together — tracks `@alineo-labs/sandbox`'s (`packages/sdks/typescript`) published `major.minor`. `apps/docs/scripts/cut-doc-version.ts` does the `cp -r` + internal-link repoint; it runs in the release flow (root `release:version` script → `changesets/action`'s `version:` step) so the `chore: version packages` PR always carries the matching folder, and `ci.yml`'s **Docs version check** job (`… cut-doc-version.ts --check`) fails any PR — the `changeset-release/main` PR included — where the epoch has moved past the latest folder. See `plans/versioned-docs.md` "Docs epoch".

**Rules that still need a human:**
1. **Writing the new folder's content.** The cut only copies the previous version; someone edits `content/docs/{core,alineo}/v<new>/` to document what actually shipped. A feature PR whose API change goes out next release should cut + document in the new folder itself (`bun apps/docs/scripts/cut-doc-version.ts` once the epoch package is bumped, else `cp -r`), never edit the current-latest folder in place.
2. **If `cut-doc-version.ts --check` is red on a PR**, a cut is owed — run the script, don't work around the check.

**If a PR touches `content/docs/core/vX.Y/` or `content/docs/alineo/vX.Y/` — where `vX.Y` is the current latest — directly instead of adding a new version folder, stop and check whether that's actually a version cut being done wrong.**
