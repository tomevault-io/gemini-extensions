Nested module structure — top-level modules (`cli`, `config`, `io`, `gtf`, `rna`) declared
in `main.rs`, no `lib.rs`. The `rna` module contains sub-modules for each tool group.
Inter-module access uses `crate::` paths (e.g., `use crate::rna::dupradar::counting::GeneCounts;`).

The CLI uses a single subcommand:

- `rustqc rna <BAM>... --gtf <GTF> [OPTIONS]`

A GTF gene annotation file (`--gtf`) is required. This runs all analyses:
dupRadar duplicate rate analysis, featureCounts-compatible gene counting,
all 8 RSeQC-equivalent tools (bam_stat, infer_experiment, read_duplication,
read_distribution, junction_annotation, junction_saturation, inner_distance,
TIN), preseq library complexity extrapolation, samtools-compatible outputs
(flagstat, idxstats, stats), and gene body coverage profiling with
Qualimap-compatible output. The GTF parser extracts transcript-level
structure (exons + CDS features) to derive all data needed by every tool.

Individual tools can be disabled via the YAML config file (each has an `enabled`
toggle). Tool-specific parameters (e.g., `--min-intron`, `--inner-distance-lower-bound`)
are available as CLI flags and in the config file.

Multiple BAM files can be passed as positional arguments and are processed sequentially.
Parallel processing is supported via `--threads`.

## Code Style

### Formatting

- **Default `rustfmt`** — no `rustfmt.toml` exists. Do not create one.
- 4-space indentation, ~100 char line width.
- Trailing commas on all multi-line constructs.
- Chained method calls break to new line with indent.

### Imports

Three groups (crate-internal, third-party, std), though blank-line separation
between groups is not strictly enforced. Each `use` is a single statement:

```rust
use crate::gtf::Gene;
use anyhow::{Context, Result};
use indexmap::IndexMap;
use log::{debug, info};
use std::collections::HashMap;
```

Localized `use` inside function bodies is acceptable for narrow imports
(e.g., `use std::io::Write;`).

### Naming

| Kind              | Convention             | Examples                                              |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Types / Structs   | `CamelCase`            | `GeneCounts`, `DupMatrix`, `FitResult`                |
| Functions/Methods | `snake_case`           | `count_reads`, `build_index`, `format_float`          |
| Constants         | `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` | `BAM_FDUP`, `DENSITY_COLORS`, `SCALE`                 |
| Modules           | `snake_case`           | `dupmatrix`, `counting`, `bam_stat`, `inner_distance` |
| Variables/Fields  | `snake_case`           | `gene_counts`, `dup_rate_multi`, `is_dup`             |
| Type aliases      | `CamelCase`            | `MateBufferKey`                                       |

### Error Handling

- **`anyhow::Result<T>`** for all fallible functions. No custom error types.
- Propagate with `?` operator.
- Add context with `.context("msg")` or `.with_context(|| format!(...))`.
- Use `anyhow::bail!()` for early error returns.
- Use `anyhow::ensure!()` for precondition checks.
- **`unwrap()` / `expect()`** are restricted to test code only. In production code,
  `unwrap()` is acceptable only when a prior guard makes it provably safe (add a comment).

### Documentation

- **Every source file** starts with `//!` module doc comment (2-4 lines).
- **All public items** (structs, fields, functions, methods) get `///` doc comments.
- Complex functions include `# Arguments` and `# Returns` sections.
- Inline `//` comments explain complex logic, domain-specific behavior, and
  references to R equivalents.
- Long files use section dividers: `// ===` for major sections, `// ---` for sub-sections.

### Types and Derives

- `#[derive(Debug)]` on all structs.
- Add `Clone`, `Default`, `Deserialize` as needed — keep derives minimal.
- Public structs expose `pub` fields. Private helper structs keep fields private.
- Numeric conventions: `u64` for counts/positions, `f64` for metrics, `u8` for flags.
- `IndexMap` when insertion order matters (gene ordering); `HashMap` for unordered lookups.

### Clippy

- Default clippy settings with `-D warnings` (deny all warnings).
- Targeted `#[allow(...)]` annotations are acceptable with justification:
  - `#[allow(dead_code)]` for fields kept for API completeness.
  - `#[allow(clippy::too_many_arguments)]` when refactoring would reduce clarity.

### Tests

- **Unit tests** co-located in each source file inside `#[cfg(test)] mod tests { use super::*; ... }`.
- **Integration tests** in `tests/integration_test.rs` — run the binary as a subprocess
  and compare output against R reference files in `tests/expected/`.
- Test naming: `test_<description_in_snake_case>`.
- Use `assert_eq!` with descriptive messages for exact comparisons.
- Use `assert!((val - expected).abs() < tolerance)` for float comparisons.
- No dev-dependencies — tests use only std + crate dependencies.

## CI Pipeline

GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs on push to `main` and all PRs:

1. **Test** — `cargo test --release` on Ubuntu and macOS
2. **Format** — `cargo fmt --check`
3. **Clippy** — `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`

All three must pass. Uses `dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable` and `Swatinem/rust-cache@v2`.

## Release Process

Releases are triggered via **workflow dispatch** (GitHub Actions UI or `gh workflow run release`).
The workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) does the following:

1. Reads the version from `Cargo.toml` and validates it matches `Cargo.lock`.
2. Builds all binary variants (8 targets) and Docker images (baseline + 3 SIMD).
3. Only after all builds pass: creates a git tag, GitHub release (with changelog from `CHANGELOG.md`), and uploads binary artifacts.
4. Publishes to crates.io as the final step.

To prepare a release:

1. Update `version` in `Cargo.toml`.
2. Run `cargo update --package rustqc` to sync `Cargo.lock`.
3. Add a new section to `CHANGELOG.md` following the existing format.
4. Commit and push to `main`.
5. Trigger the Release workflow via GitHub Actions.

## Duplicate Marking Validation

RustQC verifies that BAM files have been processed by a duplicate-marking tool before
running the RNA duplication analysis. This is implemented in two layers:

1. **Pre-flight `@PG` header check** (`counting::verify_duplicates_marked`): Parses the
   BAM header text for `@PG` lines and checks the `ID:` and `PN:` fields against
   `KNOWN_DUP_MARKERS` (Picard MarkDuplicates, samblaster, sambamba, biobambam, etc.).
   Exits with `anyhow::bail!()` if no known tool is found.
2. **Post-hoc zero-duplicates check**: After counting, if `total_dup == 0` with
   `total_mapped > 0`, bails with an error — catches cases where the header is present
   but duplicates weren't actually flagged.

Both checks are skipped when `--skip-dup-check` is passed (stored as `RnaArgs.skip_dup_check`,
forwarded to `count_reads()` as the `skip_dup_check: bool` parameter).

## Notes for Agents

- A `.pre-commit-config.yaml` is provided for local git hooks (fmt, clippy, file hygiene).
  Use [prek](https://github.com/j178/prek) (`prek install`) or the original
  [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to activate them.
- The codebase is a pure binary crate with no library target.
- Release builds use aggressive optimization (`lto = true`, `codegen-units = 1`, `strip = true`).
- Test data is generated by `tests/create_test_data.R` — do not modify `tests/expected/` by hand.
- Float output formatting must match R's behavior (15 significant digits, "NA" for NaN, trailing-zero trimming).
- The pipeline processes BAM files which can be very large — performance matters.
- System dependencies needed for building: cmake, zlib, bz2, lzma, curl, ssl, clang (for `rust-htslib`).
- Benchmark results are produced by the [RustQC-benchmarks](https://github.com/seqeralabs/RustQC-benchmarks)
  Nextflow pipeline. When benchmarks are re-run, verify that all results referenced in the docs
  and the top-level `README.md` are updated to reflect the new numbers.
- The YAML config mirrors the CLI subcommand hierarchy: all RNA-Seq settings live
  under a top-level `rna:` key. Within `rna:`, output toggles are nested under
  `dupradar:` and `featurecounts:` keys. Each output file can be individually
  enabled/disabled (all default to `true`).
- Under `rna:`, there are sections for each of the 8 RSeQC tools (`bam_stat:`,
  `infer_experiment:`, `read_duplication:`, `read_distribution:`, `junction_annotation:`,
  `junction_saturation:`, `inner_distance:`, `tin:`). Each has an `enabled: bool` toggle
  and tool-specific parameter overrides. CLI flags take precedence over config values.
- Under `rna:`, there are also sections for `preseq:`, `qualimap:`,
  `flagstat:`, `idxstats:`, and `samtools_stats:`. Each has an `enabled: bool` toggle.
  Preseq has additional parameters: `max_extrap`, `step_size`, `n_bootstraps`,
  `confidence_level`, `seed`, `max_terms`, `defects`. TIN has `sample_size` and
  `min_coverage`.
- The `featurecounts.rs` module produces featureCounts-compatible output files (counts TSV,
  summary, biotype counts, and MultiQC files). These are generated in the same pass as
  the dupRadar analysis — no separate featureCounts run is needed.
- The GTF parser (`gtf.rs`) accepts extra attribute names to extract (e.g., `gene_biotype`,
  `gene_type`) and stores them in `Gene.attributes`. The biotype attribute name is
  configurable via `--biotype-attribute` CLI flag or `featurecounts.biotype_attribute`
  in the YAML config.
- GENCODE GTFs use `gene_type` while Ensembl GTFs use `gene_biotype`. The tool
  auto-detects which is present and falls back gracefully with a warning if neither is found.
- GTF annotation files can be provided plain or gzip-compressed (`.gz`).
  Detection is based on file magic bytes, not the file extension. The shared `io` module
  (`src/io.rs`) provides an `open_reader()` helper that transparently handles both formats.
