## Project Summary

Satsuma is a domain-specific language for source-to-target data mapping. The repository contains the language specification, a canonical example corpus, a tree-sitter parser, a multi-command CLI for structural extraction and validation, and a VS Code syntax highlighting extension.

All tooling is parser-backed. Downstream tools should be built on the tree-sitter CST and stable AST conventions rather than ad hoc text processing.

## Repository Layout

Current per-package test counts and the CLI command count are tracked in [`test-stats.json`](test-stats.json).

- `docs/developer/SATSUMA-V2-SPEC.md`: authoritative language specification (v2)
- `docs/product-owner/PROJECT-OVERVIEW.md`: product vision, motivation, and roadmap
- `SATSUMA-CLI.md`: CLI command reference
- `AI-AGENT-REFERENCE.md`: compact grammar and agent-oriented Satsuma guidance (v2) — also available via `satsuma agent-reference`
- `HOW-DO-I.md`: question-based index to all guides and conventions
- `docs/product-owner/ROADMAP.md`: deferred work items, ideas, and convention docs still to write
- `examples/`: canonical `.stm` examples and fixtures (v2 syntax)
- `archive/v1/`: archived v1 specification and examples — for historical reference only, not for new work
- `archive/features/`: delivered feature specs — for historical reference only. A spec moves here once its feature ships
- `features/`: active feature plans. See [ROADMAP.md](docs/product-owner/ROADMAP.md) for which are active and which have shipped — that page is the cross-feature view, and a spec's own `Status:` line is authoritative for its own feature
- `useful-prompts/`: self-contained system prompts for web LLMs (Excel-to-Satsuma, Satsuma-to-Excel)
- `skills/`: Agent Skills following the [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io) standard (Excel-to-Satsuma conversion skill, Satsuma-to-Excel export skill)
- `scripts/`: utility scripts used during development
- `tooling/tree-sitter-satsuma/`: tree-sitter grammar, generated parser artifacts, and queries
- `tooling/satsuma-core/`: **the shared library every other package builds on** — parsing, extraction, validation, formatting, NL `@ref` resolution, and the single definition of coverage semantics. Logic that more than one consumer needs belongs here; see [Core vs Consumer Packages](#core-vs-consumer-packages)
- `tooling/satsuma-scenario-gen/`: **test-only** generator of semantic Satsuma scenarios shared by every package's property suites — builds scenarios as plain data, renders them to source, and states the ground truth that follows by construction. Must never depend on `@satsuma/core` (core's tests depend on it, so the reverse edge would be a cycle); the adapters that drive production pipelines live in each consumer's test tree
- `tooling/satsuma-cli/`: TypeScript CLI tool for workspace extraction, validation, and structural analysis
- `tooling/satsuma-lsp/`: editor-agnostic Language Server (semantic tokens, diagnostics, go-to-definition, find-references, completions, hover, rename, code lens, folding, document symbols); runnable standalone via `npx satsuma-lsp --stdio`
- `tooling/satsuma-viz-model/`: the VizModel protocol contract — the payload shape the LSP produces and the viz component consumes, defined once so neither can drift
- `tooling/satsuma-viz-backend/`: workspace indexing and VizModel assembly shared by the LSP and browser hosts; also computes the field coverage the payload carries (ADR-042)
- `tooling/satsuma-viz/`: the `satsuma-viz` Lit web component — overview graph and per-mapping detail view, embedded in the VS Code webview and the site playground
- `tooling/satsuma-viz-harness/`: Playwright harness for the viz component — headless Chromium regression suite, see [Viz harness Playwright tests](#viz-harness-playwright-tests)
- `tooling/vscode-satsuma/`: VS Code extension (LSP client, commands, webview panels) and TextMate grammar; delegates language intelligence to `satsuma-lsp`
- `tooling/integration-tests/`: **test-only** cross-consumer parity sweeps (CLI vs. the VizModel both the webview and the LSP consume) — the one place both sides are reachable without either package taking on a dependency its own architecture forbids

## Platform Lineage Entry Point

When reasoning about lineage across a multi-file data platform, look for a **platform entry point file** that uses `import` with namespace-qualified names to pull definitions from across the platform. This is the canonical entry point for platform-wide lineage traversal.

```satsuma
// platform.stm — the entry point
import { crm::customers, crm::orders } from "crm/pipeline.stm"
import { billing::invoices } from "billing/pipeline.stm"
import { warehouse::inventory } from "warehouse/ingest.stm"
```

Use `satsuma lineage --from <schema> platform.stm` to trace data flow through the platform. See `archive/features/15-namespaces/PRD.md` for the full namespace specification.

## Source of Truth

When making changes or answering questions about syntax, semantics, or supported constructs:

1. Treat `docs/developer/SATSUMA-V2-SPEC.md` as the primary authority. The v1 spec is archived at `archive/v1/STM-SPEC.md` — do not use it for new work.
2. Use `examples/` as the executable corpus of valid language patterns (v2 syntax).
3. Use feature docs in `features/` to guide tooling order and architecture.
4. If docs conflict, prefer the spec and call out the mismatch explicitly.

## Engineering Expectations

- Preserve Satsuma readability for both humans and machines.
- Prefer parser-backed solutions over regex or line-oriented heuristics.
- Keep CST/AST naming intentional and stable for downstream consumers.
- Add or update tests with every behavior change.
- Use the example corpus as golden fixtures whenever possible.
- Document any ambiguity, unsupported syntax, or recovery behavior near the implementation.

### Core vs Consumer Packages

Before closing a ticket, assess whether logic you've added or modified in a consumer package (CLI, LSP, viz, VS Code extension) is actually a **core concern** that belongs in `satsuma-core`. Shared data transformation, naming conventions, NL ref handling, and format normalization are examples of core concerns. If the logic would need to be duplicated by another consumer (e.g. the LSP needs the same utility the CLI uses), it belongs in core. Move it — including its tests — as part of the ticket work, not as deferred cleanup.

## Code Readability

**The satsuma-lang tooling is intended to be a teaching example** — the kind of codebase a developer can read to learn how to build a tree-sitter-backed language toolchain well. Every file should meet that bar. When in doubt, ask: *would a capable developer unfamiliar with this system understand what this code does, why it exists, and how it fits the whole — just by reading it?*

Write code in the spirit of Literate Programming and Clean Code: code should read as a clear explanation of *what* it does and *why*, not just a sequence of instructions for the machine. Functions should be small and focused. Names should communicate intent. Business rules should be visible, not buried.

- **Module-level comments** — every non-trivial module must open with a comment explaining its purpose, what it owns, and what it does not own. A reader skimming the file should understand its role in the system within the first five lines.
- **Function doc-comments** — exported functions must have a doc-comment that states the contract (inputs, outputs, invariants). Private helpers need a comment only when their intent is non-obvious. A doc-comment that merely restates the function name adds noise — say something a reader couldn't infer from the signature alone.
- **Type comments** — exported types and their fields must carry inline comments explaining what each field represents and how consumers use it. Type declarations are part of the public contract and should read as prose.
- **Section comments** — group logically related code with a short header comment. Modules with multiple distinct responsibilities (e.g. a validation module checking duplicates, then missing refs, then field alignment) must label each section.
- **Named constants over magic values** — raw strings, numbers, regex literals, and array indices with non-obvious meaning must be extracted to named constants with a comment explaining the value and its source. `slice(0, 8)` with no comment is not acceptable; `slice(0, MAX_PREVIEW_FIELDS)` with a comment is.
- **Small functions** — functions over ~40 lines are a signal to decompose or add sectional comments explaining the algorithm. Long functions that mix concerns must be refactored.
- **Business rules must be visible** — domain rules (e.g. Data Vault naming conventions, known pipeline function names, formatter column caps) must be clearly labelled as rules, with a comment citing their source or rationale. They must not be buried as anonymous magic values.
- **No orphan comments** — do not leave TODO/FIXME comments without a ticket reference. Link deferred work (`// see sl-xxxx`). Remove comments that describe what the code used to do.

## Testing Expectations

- Every task must end with the relevant automated tests run locally and passing before picking up the next task.
- Each task implementation must expand or update test coverage to match the behavior it adds or changes.
- Keep the repo commit hooks installed and passing; they should block commits when required validation or tests fail. See [Installing the pre-commit hook](#installing-the-pre-commit-hook) — **check it is installed before your first commit in any clone or worktree**.
- New parser or tooling work must include targeted tests and fixture coverage.
- Valid syntax changes should add or update canonical examples or corpus fixtures.
- Invalid or recovery-sensitive behavior should include malformed input tests.
- Avoid merging parser work that is only manually verified.

### Test quality standards

Tests should be high-value and low-inertia. A test suite is an asset only when the cost of maintaining it is lower than the cost of not having it.

- **Every test must have a purpose comment.** Each `it()`/`test()` block must open with a comment (or use the description string itself) explaining *why* this case exists and *what property* it validates — not just a restatement of what the code does. A future reader must understand at a glance whether a failing test represents a regression or an outdated expectation.
- **No redundant tests.** When consolidating logic into a shared module, consolidate the tests too. Do not keep tests in consumer packages that merely re-test the same behaviour already covered in the core module's test suite. Test each invariant once, at the right level of abstraction.
- **Test inputs should be minimal.** Use the smallest Satsuma snippet that exercises the case. Avoid copying full example files into test fixtures unless the whole-file structure is what is under test.
- **No smoke tests.** Do not write tests that only verify a function returns without throwing, or that a known-valid input produces a non-null result. Every assertion should validate a specific, meaningful property of the output.
- **Name cases by behaviour, not by implementation.** Prefer `"reports a diagnostic when the same schema name appears in two files"` over `"duplicate schema test"`. The description should be a falsifiable statement about the system.

### Unit tests prove logic; only a browser proves the visual contract

sl-rj78 and sl-d7fz were both filed from a screenshot: a reader hovered an
arrow row in the mapping detail view and the wrong fields (or no fields) lit
up. Both were fixed by an agent that wrote unit tests calling the component's
private `_sourceHighlightFields`/`_targetHighlightFields` getters directly,
proved the resolution logic returned the right paths, ran the full
`run-repo-checks.sh` suite green, and opened the PR. Every automated check
passed. The fix was still unverified in the one sense that mattered: nothing
had rendered `<sz-mapping-detail>` in a real DOM, dispatched a real
`mouseenter`, and confirmed the `.hl` class actually landed on the actual
field row a reader would see. The gap wasn't caught by CI — it was caught by
the user asking "did this need a viz harness test?" after the PR was already
open. That question should not have needed asking.

The reason the getter tests missed it is structural, not an oversight this one
time: a Lit component's `render()` output, its shadow-DOM class list, and its
real mouse-event wiring are only observable by actually mounting the element —
which is exactly what `tooling/satsuma-viz-harness/test/harness.test.ts`'s
`"Hover highlighting between arrows and field rows"` suite already does for
the non-nested case (`sfdc_opportunity.Amount` → `amount_usd`). A getter-level
test is real coverage of the resolution logic and should still be written —
but it answers "is the path computed correctly", not "does hovering the row
highlight the field", and treating the first as a stand-in for the second is
the mistake to avoid.

**Before closing out any change to `satsuma-viz` or `vscode-satsuma` visual or
interactive behaviour** (hover/highlight, expand/collapse, coverage
indicators, layout, drag, click-to-navigate, anything a screenshot could
show or a click could trigger), stop and answer both of these, out loud, in
the response to the user — not silently in your own reasoning:

1. **Is there a property here a unit test cannot observe?** If the change only
   alters what a function returns, a unit test suffices — say so and move on.
   If the change alters what gets *painted* or what a *user gesture* triggers
   (a CSS class after a hover, a section expanding after a click, an element's
   computed style), no amount of getter-level testing proves it; only a
   rendered browser can.
2. **Is Playwright coverage for it possible and proportionate?** Check whether
   an existing `describe` block in `harness.test.ts` already covers the
   interaction shape (see the "Hover highlighting" and "Field coverage
   indicators" sections for the pattern) and either extend it or add a new
   one. If the existing fixtures don't exercise the shape at all (e.g. no
   fixture has the doubly-nested case a bug was filed against), say that
   explicitly rather than silently reaching for the nearest fixture that
   happens to be already wired up.

If the answer to (1) is yes and (2) is yes, add the Playwright spec and run it
against the headless-Chromium harness ([Viz harness Playwright
tests](#viz-harness-playwright-tests)) before treating the task as done — do not
defer it to a follow-up ticket. If (2) is no (the interaction genuinely cannot
be expressed in the harness, or no fixture reaches the shape and adding one is
out of scope for the ticket), say so explicitly in the response, and file a
ticket for the fixture gap rather than letting the limitation go unstated.

### Viz harness Playwright tests

The `tooling/satsuma-viz-harness/` Playwright suite drives the rendered
`satsuma-viz` component with real clicks and hovers, and runs **headless
Chromium inside the agent sandbox** — no human-in-the-loop watcher, no sentinel
file. The sandbox is a Linux/root container with a system Chromium at
`/usr/bin/chromium`; `playwright.config.ts` resolves that binary, adds
`--no-sandbox` (required only when running as root), and falls back to
Playwright's bundled browser on a developer machine. Run the whole suite
directly:

```bash
npx turbo run test --filter=@satsuma/viz-harness   # builds deps, then runs all projects
# or, after `npm run build:all`:
npm --prefix tooling/satsuma-viz-harness test
```

The suite is included in `test:all`, so it also runs inside
tooling/satsuma-viz-harness's own CI job and in the pre-commit hook
(`scripts/run-repo-checks.sh`) — a commit that breaks a hover or a coverage
indicator is caught before it is pushed, which is precisely the gap sl-rj78 and
sl-d7fz fell through.

Notes:

- `pre`-script: the harness's `pretest` runs `turbo run build
  --filter=@satsuma/viz-harness`, so a bare `npm test` rebuilds the harness and
always tests current bundles. It is now the only surviving `pretest` in the
repo; do not infer that other packages still have build hooks (see
[Building and testing](#building-and-testing)).
- A developer machine without `/usr/bin/chromium` needs the bundled browser
  once: `npx playwright install chromium` (the config falls back to it).
- If a stale server is occupying :3333/:3334, Playwright's `webServer` will
  report `EADDRINUSE`; kill it (`pkill -f "node dist/server.js"`) and rerun.
- If you add a Playwright spec for a visual element only a browser can prove
  (per the checklist above), it must actually pass here before the task is done —
  do not defer it to a follow-up ticket.

## Security

CI runs `npm audit` and `gitleaks` secret scanning on every PR. Before pushing,
agents must also verify locally:

- **No secrets in commits.** Never commit API keys, tokens, passwords, or
  credentials. Check staged diffs for anything that looks like a secret before
  committing. If a secret is accidentally committed, alert the user immediately —
  do not just remove it in a follow-up commit (the value is already in git history).
- **No dependencies with critical vulnerabilities.** Run `npm audit` in any
  package directory where you added or updated dependencies. Do not merge work
  that introduces critical or high severity vulnerabilities without explicit
  user approval.
- **No `.env` or credential files.** Never stage `.env`, `credentials.json`,
  `*.pem`, or similar files. If these are needed for local development, ensure
  they are in `.gitignore`.

## Shell Command Expectations

Always use non-interactive flags with shell commands that may prompt for confirmation. Agent work must not hang waiting for terminal input from aliased or interactive defaults.

Use forms like:

```bash
cp -f source dest
mv -f source dest
rm -f file
rm -rf directory
cp -rf source dest
scp -o BatchMode=yes ...
ssh -o BatchMode=yes ...
apt-get -y ...
HOMEBREW_NO_AUTO_UPDATE=1 brew ...
```

Prefer these forms over prompt-prone variants such as plain `cp`, `mv`, or `rm`.

## Building and testing

The eleven `tooling/*` packages are npm workspaces behind one root
`package-lock.json`, and [`turbo.json`](turbo.json) defines the task graph. The
cross-package build order is **derived from the dependency graph in the
manifests** — it is not written down as a sequence anywhere, so changing it means
editing a package's `dependencies`/`devDependencies`, nothing else (ADR-049).

| What you want | Command |
|---|---|
| Install and build everything | `npm run install:all` |
| Rebuild everything | `npm run build:all` |
| Run every package's tests and typechecks | `npm run test:all` |
| Work on one package | `turbo run test --filter=<package>` |
| Coverage for every package that reports it | `npm run test:coverage` |
| The repo-level scripts' own tests | `npm run test:scripts` |
| Everything the pre-commit hook runs | `./scripts/run-repo-checks.sh` |
| Run the viz harness Playwright suite (headless Chromium) | `npx turbo run test --filter=@satsuma/viz-harness`, or `npm --prefix tooling/satsuma-viz-harness test` after `build:all` — see [Viz harness Playwright tests](#viz-harness-playwright-tests) |
| Preview the current viz UI locally | `npx turbo run build --filter=@satsuma/viz-harness && npm --prefix tooling/satsuma-viz-harness run dev`, then open <http://localhost:3333> — see [tooling/satsuma-viz-harness/README.md](tooling/satsuma-viz-harness/README.md#running-the-dev-server-locally-live-preview-not-playwright). Claude Code users can just run `/viz-dev`. |

`--filter` takes a package's **declared name**, not its directory:
`@satsuma/core`, `@satsuma/lsp`, `satsuma-cli`, `tree-sitter-satsuma`. It pulls in
that package's dependencies too, so from a completely unbuilt tree
`turbo run test --filter=@satsuma/lsp` builds core, the VizModel contract, the
viz-backend, the CLI and the grammar WASM, then runs the LSP's suite.

**The one thing that changed and will catch you out:**
`npm --prefix tooling/<package> test` **no longer builds that package's
dependencies.** Every `prebuild`/`pretest` hook that used to shell out to
`npm --prefix ../sibling run build` is gone — that duplication is exactly what
Turborepo replaced. So a bare per-package `npm test` on a freshly installed or
partly built workspace fails against missing or stale output. Either run
`npm run build:all` first, or use `turbo run test --filter=<package>`, which
cannot get it wrong.

Two more consequences worth knowing:

- **Turborepo caches by input hash, so a stale cache cannot give a wrong answer** —
  identical inputs mean identical outputs. To force real work anyway (proving a
  cold build, or debugging the cache itself), use `turbo run build --force`.
  Deleting the cache is not the tool for this: from a linked worktree under
  `.worktrees/`, turbo shares the *primary* worktree's cache and `clean:all`'s
  `.turbo` entry is a no-op.
- **One suite is deliberately outside `test:all`.** `tree-sitter-satsuma`'s `test`
  shells out to `tree-sitter test --wasm`, which needs its own environment and
  graceful-skip handling — `scripts/run-repo-checks.sh` runs it separately.
  `@satsuma/viz-harness`'s Playwright suite runs headless Chromium inside the
  sandbox and is included in `test:all` like every other package (see
  [Viz harness Playwright tests](#viz-harness-playwright-tests)).

## Running Turborepo in the agent sandbox

Builds and tests go through `turbo run` (see [`turbo.json`](turbo.json)). In the
agent sandbox, turbo needs two environment variables set first or it dies before
doing any work:

```
x Encountered an I/O error while attempting to read
| /Users/<you>/Library/Application Support/com.vercel.cli/auth.json
```

That is not a turbo misconfiguration and not a missing Vercel login. The sandbox
denies reads under `~/Library/Application Support`, and turbo probes two
directories there at startup — its own config and the Vercel CLI's — treating an
unreadable one as fatal rather than absent. Point both at your scratchpad:

```bash
export TURBO_CONFIG_DIR_PATH="$SCRATCHPAD/turbo-config"
export VERCEL_CONFIG_DIR_PATH="$SCRATCHPAD/vercel-config"
```

Set them **before `git commit`**, not just before a manual `turbo run`: the
pre-commit hook runs `scripts/run-repo-checks.sh`, which invokes turbo, and
environment variables propagate into git hooks. A commit that fails on the
`auth.json` read is this, not a broken check.

Neither variable is needed outside the sandbox, and CI (Linux, where turbo reads
`~/.config`) is unaffected.

## Running tree-sitter CLI

**Always pass `--wasm`.** There is no native build in this repository: the
`tree-sitter-satsuma` package's `install` script deliberately skips node-gyp, and
every consumer loads `tree-sitter-satsuma.wasm`. The native path needs a C
toolchain, which is exactly the portability the WASM migration removed (ADR-002).
`npm test` in that package is already the `--wasm` path (sl-cysb) — you do not
need to add the flag yourself when using the npm scripts.

**In the agent sandbox, also redirect the tree-sitter cache.** `--wasm` alone is
not sufficient. Both the native and the WASM path compile the grammar into
`~/.cache/tree-sitter/`, which the sandbox cannot write, and the failure is an
opaque lock-file error that looks nothing like a permissions problem:

```
Error: Operation not permitted (os error 1) (~/.cache/tree-sitter/lock/satsuma-<hash>.lock)
```

Point `XDG_CACHE_HOME` at your scratchpad and the corpus tests run normally:

```bash
XDG_CACHE_HOME="$SCRATCHPAD/ts-cache" npm --prefix tooling/tree-sitter-satsuma test
```

Do **not** conclude from the lock error that the corpus tests cannot be run
locally — they can, and they must be before any grammar change is pushed. All 318
parses should pass.

## Code Search with ast-grep

`ast-grep` (available as `ast-grep` in the environment) performs structural AST-based search and rewrite, backed by tree-sitter.

### When to use it

Prefer `ast-grep` over `grep` when you care about syntax structure, not text:

- **Searching `grammar.js`**: find rule definitions, specific combinators, or usages of a rule name without false positives from comments or strings.
- **Searching Python scripts** under `scripts/`: structural function-call or import searches.
- **Future Satsuma linting**: once the grammar is registered as a custom language (see below), `ast-grep scan` can enforce structural rules over `.stm` files.

Use plain `Grep` when scanning corpus fixtures or other plain-text files — those aren't parsed as code.

### Quick patterns for grammar.js

```bash
# Find all seq() calls (and see their content)
ast-grep run -l js -p 'seq($$$)' tooling/tree-sitter-satsuma/grammar.js

# Find all choice() calls
ast-grep run -l js -p 'choice($$$)' tooling/tree-sitter-satsuma/grammar.js

# Find a specific property in the rules object
ast-grep run -l js -p 'transform_body: $_' tooling/tree-sitter-satsuma/grammar.js
```

Metavariables: `$NAME` matches a single node; `$$$` matches zero or more.

### Registering Satsuma as a custom language (future)

When the grammar is stable enough for structural search and lint, create `sgconfig.yml` at the repo root:

```yaml
# sgconfig.yml
customLanguages:
  satsuma:
    libraryPath: tooling/tree-sitter-satsuma/build/satsuma.dylib  # or .so on Linux
    extensions: [stm]
    expandoChar: _
```

Note this needs a shared library, and there is no native build in this repository
— the WASM migration removed it (ADR-002), so `npm run build` in that package
produces `tree-sitter-satsuma.wasm`, not a dylib. Registering Satsuma as a custom
`ast-grep` language therefore needs a native build step that does not exist yet;
treat the snippet above as a sketch of the eventual setup rather than as
instructions that work today. It is the foundation for a future Satsuma linter
implemented as `ast-grep scan` rules.

## Issue Tracking

This project uses a CLI ticket system for task management. Run `tk help` when you need to use it.


Expected workflow:

- Capture dependencies explicitly so ready work can be derived from the graph.
- Include clear acceptance criteria on every implementation task.
- Represent testing work inside the acceptance criteria or as dependent tasks when large enough to stand alone.
- **Before closing a ticket**, add a timestamped `## Notes` entry describing the root cause and the fix applied. Use the format:
  ```
  ## Notes

  **<ISO-8601 timestamp>**

  Cause: <1-2 sentences describing root cause>
  Fix: <1-2 sentences describing what was changed> (commit immediately after <current short-sha>)
  ```
  Reference the current `HEAD` short-sha (`git rev-parse --short HEAD`), not the fix
  commit's own sha — that sha doesn't exist yet while you're authoring the note, and
  waiting for it forces a second commit (and a second full pre-commit test run) just
  to backfill it. "The commit immediately after `<sha>`" is unambiguous and lets the
  ticket update and the fix land in one commit.
- Worktree and server sync is handled manually outside the agent workflow.

## Agent Workflow

- **All code changes must go through a PR.** Direct pushes to `main` are blocked.
  See [AGENT-CONTRIBUTIONS.md](docs/developer/AGENT-CONTRIBUTIONS.md) for the
  full contribution workflow including worktree setup, branch naming, and parallel
  work conventions.
- Use git worktrees in `.worktrees/` for feature isolation. Create one per feature
  branch so multiple agents can work in parallel without conflicts.
- **After creating a new worktree**, run `npm run install:all` from the worktree
  root. That is one root `npm install` against the single `package-lock.json`
  (the eleven `tooling/*` packages are npm workspaces) followed by
  `turbo run build compile`, which builds every package in dependency order.
  Without it the pre-commit hook fails, because nothing else builds the workspace.
- **Check the pre-commit hook is installed before your first commit** in any clone
  or worktree — see [Installing the pre-commit hook](#installing-the-pre-commit-hook).
  If it isn't installed, install it. Do not just note it in the PR body.
- Read the relevant feature doc in `features/` before implementing planned work.
- Inspect existing examples and docs before making syntax or tooling assumptions.
- Keep changes scoped and directly tied to the current task.
- **Always include `.tickets/` changes in every commit — no exceptions.** The `tk` tool stores task state there and it must stay in sync with the code. Stage `.tickets/` alongside your other changes before committing.
- Do not pick up the next task until the current task's relevant automated tests have been run locally and are passing.
- If a requested change would contradict the spec, stop and raise the conflict clearly.
- For work in `tooling/tree-sitter-satsuma/`, treat corpus tests in `tooling/tree-sitter-satsuma/test/corpus/` and generated parser artifacts as part of the implementation surface.
- When changing the tree-sitter grammar, update the grammar source, regenerate parser outputs as needed, and verify the corpus fixtures.
- **Before opening a PR**, review the commits on the branch and ask: *does this change represent an architectural decision that should be recorded?* Use `/adr-draft` to assess and draft. If an ADR is warranted, check with the user, draft it in `adrs/`, and mark any superseded ADRs (ADR bodies are immutable — the only permitted edits are the Status line and repointing a file path that moved). Include the ADR files in the PR commit. See `skills/adr-draft/SKILL.md` for the full assessment criteria and format.

### Installing the pre-commit hook

The repo's checks live in `.githooks/pre-commit`, which runs
`scripts/run-repo-checks.sh`. Git only fires them if `core.hooksPath` points at
`.githooks`. That setting is **local config, not tracked in the repo**, so it is
missing in every fresh clone and every new worktree until someone sets it — and
when it is missing, commits sail through with no checks at all and nothing warns
you.

Check it before your first commit in a clone or worktree:

```bash
git config core.hooksPath        # must print: .githooks
```

If it prints `.git/hooks`, prints nothing, or the hook is otherwise not firing,
install it yourself — this is a one-line local fix, not something to defer or
merely flag in the PR body:

```bash
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

Then confirm your commit actually runs the checks. A commit that completes
instantly with no check output is the signature of an uninstalled hook.

## Adding a New Feature

1. Create `features/<feature-name>/PRD.md` describing the problem, success
   criteria, and acceptance tests before writing any code.
2. Write failing tests first (TDD) where practical.
3. Implement the smallest change that makes the tests pass. Always do the RIGHT thing, not the FAST thing, so never hack tests or add lint ignore rules because that's easier than fixing the underlying issue.
6. Update `docs/product-owner/PROJECT-OVERVIEW.md` if the architecture changes.

When you are implementing a whole feature in a Ralph Loop, and have finished all related tk (ticket) tasks such that there are no remaining ready tasks, emit <PROMISE>DONE</PROMISE> to signal completion of the feature.

* Commit your changes after each tk task completes (AND after you have proven that tests are passing and you have added any new coverage and documentation updates).
