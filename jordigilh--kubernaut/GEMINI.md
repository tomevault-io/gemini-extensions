# Kubernaut Core Development Rules

## 🚨 **MANDATORY PRINCIPLES**

### 1. Business Requirements Mandate
**EVERY code change MUST be backed by at least ONE business requirement**

**Format**: `BR-[CATEGORY]-[NUMBER]` (e.g., BR-WORKFLOW-001, BR-AI-056)

**Categories**: WORKFLOW, AI, INTEGRATION, SECURITY, PLATFORM, API, STORAGE, MONITORING, SAFETY, PERFORMANCE

**Rules**:
- All tests must map to specific business requirements
- All implementation code must serve documented business needs
- No speculative or "nice to have" code without business backing

---

### 2. Critical Decision Process
**MANDATORY**: Ask for input on ALL critical decisions:
- Architecture changes and design patterns
- New dependencies or external integrations
- Performance trade-offs and optimization decisions
- Security implementations and access controls
- Refactoring that affects system complexity

**Format**: Provide recommendation with detailed justification when asking

---

### 3. APDC Methodology (Complex Tasks)
**Use for**: Complex features, refactoring, new components, build error fixing, AI/ML development

**Phases**:
1. **Analysis** (5-15 min): Context + business alignment + risk assessment
2. **Plan** (10-20 min): Strategy + TDD mapping + **user approval required**
3. **Do** (Variable): RED → GREEN → REFACTOR with validation checkpoints
4. **Check** (5-10 min): Validation + confidence assessment (60-100%)

**See**: [Complete APDC Framework](mdc:docs/development/methodology/APDC_FRAMEWORK.md)
**Quick Ref**: [APDC Quick Reference](mdc:docs/development/methodology/APDC_QUICK_REFERENCE.md)

---

### 4. TDD Workflow (All Development)
**MANDATORY**: RED → GREEN → REFACTOR (tests first, always)

1. **RED**: Write failing tests defining business contract
2. **GREEN**: Minimal implementation + MANDATORY main app integration
3. **REFACTOR**: Enhance existing code with sophisticated logic

**NEVER**: Use `Skip()` to avoid test failures
**NEVER**: Skip REFACTOR phase

---

## 🤖 **AI ASSISTANT BEHAVIOR - MANDATORY CHECKPOINTS**

### **CHECKPOINT A: Type Reference Validation**
**TRIGGER**: About to reference any struct field (e.g., `object.FieldName`)

**MANDATORY ACTION**:
```bash
# HALT: Read type definition file BEFORE referencing fields
read_file [type_definition_file]
# RULE: Verify field exists in struct definition
```

**Violation**: "🚨 Type reference attempted without validation - DEVELOPMENT STOPPED"

---

### **CHECKPOINT B: Test Creation Validation**
**TRIGGER**: About to create test file with business logic references

**MANDATORY ACTION**:
```bash
# HALT: Search for existing implementations FIRST
codebase_search "existing [ComponentType] implementations"
grep -r "[ComponentType]" pkg/ --include="*.go"
# RULE: Enhance existing patterns instead of creating new
```

**Violation**: "🚨 Test creation attempted without existing implementation analysis - DEVELOPMENT STOPPED"

---

### **CHECKPOINT C: Business Integration Validation**
**TRIGGER**: Creating new business types or interfaces

**MANDATORY ACTION**:
```bash
# HALT: Verify main application integration
grep -r "[NewComponentType]" cmd/ --include="*.go"
# RULE: Business code MUST be integrated in main applications (cmd/)
```

**Violation**: "🚨 Business component creation attempted without main app integration validation - DEVELOPMENT STOPPED"

---

### **CHECKPOINT D: Build Error Investigation**
**TRIGGER**: User reports build errors or undefined symbols

**MANDATORY ACTION**:
```bash
# HALT: Execute comprehensive symbol analysis
codebase_search "[undefined_symbol] usage patterns and dependencies"
grep -r "[undefined_symbol]" . --include="*.go" -n
go build [affected_file] 2>&1
# RULE: Present complete analysis with options A/B/C before implementation
```

**Required Report Format**:
```
🚨 UNDEFINED SYMBOL ANALYSIS:
Symbol: [undefined_symbol]
References found: [N files with paths]
Dependent infrastructure: [list missing types/functions]
Scope: [minimal/medium/extensive with evidence]

OPTIONS (Evidence-Based):
A) Implement complete infrastructure ([X] files affected)
B) Create minimal stub ([Z] files affected, may break [W] files)
C) Alternative approach: [evidence-based alternative]

🚫 MANDATORY USER DECISION REQUIRED: Which approach? (A/B/C)
```

**Violation**: "🚨 Build error resolution attempted without comprehensive analysis + user approval - DEVELOPMENT STOPPED"

---

## 🚫 **FORBIDDEN AI ACTIONS**

**NEVER DO THESE**:
1. **NEVER** reference struct fields without first reading the type definition file
2. **NEVER** assume testutil types exist - always validate with `read_file` or `grep`
3. **NEVER** create test code without first using `codebase_search` for existing implementations
4. **NEVER** generate business types without confirming main application usage
5. **NEVER** proceed if any validation step fails
6. **NEVER** implement missing types without full dependency analysis (CHECKPOINT D)

---

## 💻 **CODE QUALITY STANDARDS**

### Error Handling (MANDATORY)
- **ALWAYS** handle errors, never ignore them
- **ALWAYS** add log entry for every error
- Use structured error types from `internal/errors/`
- Wrap errors with context: `fmt.Errorf("description: %w", err)`

### Type System
- **AVOID** using `any` or `interface{}` unless absolutely necessary
- **ALWAYS** use structured field values with specific types
- **AVOID** local type definitions to resolve import cycles
- Use shared types from `pkg/shared/types/` instead

### Business Integration
- **MANDATORY**: Integrate all new business code with main code (cmd/)
- Remove any code not backed by business requirements
- Ensure seamless integration with existing architecture

### Real-Time Integration Checkpoints
```bash
# CHECKPOINT 1: Before creating ANY new type
grep -r "NewComponent\|ComponentName" cmd/ pkg/workflow/ pkg/processor/
# RULE: If ZERO results, ask "Why isn't this enhancing existing code?"

# CHECKPOINT 2: During TDD GREEN Phase (tests passing)
find cmd/ -name "*.go" -exec grep -l "YourNewComponent" {} \;
# RULE: Must show at least ONE main application file, or STOP and integrate

# CHECKPOINT 3: After ANY sophisticated enhancement
grep -r "New.*Optimizer\|New.*Engine\|New.*Builder" cmd/ --include="*.go"
# RULE: New sophisticated code MUST appear in main application startup
```

---

## 🧪 **TESTING REQUIREMENTS**

### Framework (MANDATORY)
- **Ginkgo/Gomega BDD** framework (NO standard Go testing)
- **Test Identification** (in test descriptions):
  - **PREFERRED**: Test Scenario IDs (e.g., `UT-WF-197-001`, `IT-GW-045-010`) if test plan exists
  - **FALLBACK**: Business requirement references (BR-[CATEGORY]-[NUMBER]) if no test plan
- **Test Plans**: Create formal test plan BEFORE implementation (aids TDD methodology)
  - **Template**: `docs/development/testing/V1_0_SERVICE_MATURITY_TEST_PLAN_TEMPLATE.md`
  - **Policy**: `docs/architecture/decisions/DD-TEST-006-test-plan-policy.md`
  - **Benefit**: Methodical TDD execution with pre-defined test scenarios

### Per-Tier Testable Code Coverage (>=80% per tier)
- **Unit Tests**: >=80% of **unit-testable** code (pure logic: config, validators, scoring, builders)
- **Integration Tests**: >=80% of **integration-testable** code (I/O: reconciler, K8s clients, HTTP handlers, DB adapters)
- **E2E Tests**: >=80% of full service code (full stack execution in Kind)
- **All Tiers**: >=80% merged (line-by-line dedup across all tiers)

**TDD Mandate**: Every business requirement MUST have a corresponding test. If a feature has no test, it risks not being implemented. Coverage is measured per-tier against the tier-specific code subset (see `scripts/coverage/coverage_report.py` and TESTING_GUIDELINES.md).

### Mock Strategy
**Mock ONLY External Dependencies**:
- ✅ External APIs (LLM, HolmesGPT, OpenAI)
- ✅ Databases (PostgreSQL, Vector DB, Redis)
- ✅ Kubernetes API (use `fake.NewClientBuilder()`)
- ✅ Network services (external HTTP/gRPC)

**Use Real Business Logic**:
- ✅ **ALL** `pkg/` code
- ✅ **ALL** internal algorithms
- ✅ **ALL** business validators/analyzers/optimizers

**See**: [Testing Strategy](mdc:.cursor/rules/03-testing-strategy.mdc)

## 📋 **TDD ANTI-PATTERNS - FORBIDDEN**

### Discovery Skip
**Violation**: Creating without searching existing
**Rule**: Use `codebase_search` FIRST

### RED Skip
**Violation**: Implementation without failing tests
**Rule**: Write tests FIRST

### GREEN Complexity
**Violation**: Sophisticated logic in GREEN phase
**Rule**: Keep minimal, enhance in REFACTOR

### REFACTOR Creation
**Violation**: New types in REFACTOR phase
**Rule**: Enhance existing only

### Integration Delay
**Violation**: Component not integrated in GREEN
**Rule**: MANDATORY integration in GREEN phase


### Refactoring Without Build Validation
**Violation**: Refactoring code (renaming, field type changes, etc.) without checking for lingering build failures
**Rule**: After refactoring, ALWAYS verify build success across entire codebase
**Risk**: Field renames, type changes, and signature updates often break dependent code

**MANDATORY Post-Refactor Validation**:
```bash
# After ANY refactoring (rename, type change, signature update)
go build ./...                     # Verify entire codebase builds
go test ./... -run=^$ -timeout=30s # Quick compile-only test check
grep -r "OldFieldName|OldTypeName" . --include="*.go" # Check for missed references
```

**Common Refactoring Pitfalls**:
- Field renames: Old field name still referenced elsewhere
- Type changes: Dependent code expects old type
- Signature updates: Callers not updated to match
- Package moves: Import paths not updated

**Rule**: Treat refactoring as HIGH RISK for build failures - validate immediately
---

## 🎯 **COMPLETION REQUIREMENTS**

### Post-Development Checklist (MANDATORY)

After completing any development task:

1. **Build Validation**: Code builds without errors
2. **Lint Compliance**: No new lint errors (unusedparam, unusedfunc, etc.)
3. **Business Integration**: Confidence assessment of business code integration
4. **Enhancement Proposals**: Suggest improvements with ≥60% confidence level

### Confidence Assessment Format (REQUIRED)

Provide BOTH:
- **Simple Percentage**: 60-100% confidence rating
- **Detailed Justification**: Including risks, assumptions, and validation approach

**Example**:
```
Confidence Assessment: 85%
Justification: Implementation follows established patterns in pkg/workflow/engine/
and integrates cleanly with existing HolmesGPT client. Risk: Minor performance
impact on high-alert scenarios. Validation: Unit tests cover 90% of edge cases.
```

---

## 🔧 **VALIDATION COMMANDS**

```bash
# Build and lint
go build ./...
golangci-lint run --timeout=5m

# Test pyramid
make test                          # Unit tests
make test-integration-[service]    # Integration tests
make test-e2e-[service]            # E2E tests

# Rule compliance
make lint-test-patterns            # Test anti-patterns
make lint-business-integration     # Business code integration
make lint-tdd-compliance           # TDD and BDD framework
```

## 🔗 **RULE INTEGRATION**

**PRIORITY LEVEL**: 1 - FOUNDATIONAL

**Authority**: This rule establishes mandatory methodology that controls all other development rules

**Integration**: All specialized rules (AI/ML, Kubernetes, Testing, etc.) operate within this foundational framework

---

**Remember**: Business requirements drive functionality. TDD ensures quality. APDC ensures systematic delivery. AI checkpoints prevent errors before they occur.
