## Core Principles

These principles govern every change to this project. They are not
guidelines — they are hard constraints. When in doubt, the principle
wins over convenience.

### Architecture

1. **Separation of Concerns is non-negotiable.** Each module does one
   thing. Transport-specific logic stays in transport-scoped modules.
   Shared logic lives in shared modules. No generic abstractions that
   span transport boundaries — if two things share a name but not
   logic, they belong in separate modules.

2. **DRY is non-negotiable.** If the same logic appears in 2+ places,
   extract a shared helper. Duplicated protocol constants, signing
   functions, or dispatch logic are architecture bugs, not tech debt.

3. **Core is platform-agnostic.** No `homeassistant.*` imports in
   Core. HA-specific code stays in `custom_components/`. Core's API
   is synchronous (`requests`-based I/O). The HA adapter is a thin
   wrapper — if HA wiring requires non-trivial logic, Core's API
   boundaries are wrong.

4. **New features are additive only.** New format, new auth strategy,
   new transport, new parser — none of these change existing code.
   Add a new implementation, register it, done. If adding a feature
   requires modifying unrelated modules, the architecture is wrong.

5. **Protocol primitives are shared, implementation is scoped.**
   Constants and signing functions live in shared protocol modules
   (`protocol/hnap.py`). How a transport uses them is transport-
   specific (auth, loaders, and action executors each own their flow).

### Modem Configuration

6. **Modem behavior is data-driven.** Core provides a set of
   behaviours (auth strategies, extraction modes, parsers, executors).
   Each modem selects from them via YAML. No modem's configuration
   requires code changes. No modem's configuration affects another.

7. **Config fields are parameters to core behaviours, not raw
   implementations.** `auth.strategy: form` selects an auth strategy.
   `endpoint_pattern: "RouterStatus"` supplies a keyword to a core
   extraction strategy. Contributors provide *what*, core handles
   *how*. If a config field requires regex, code, or implementation
   knowledge, the abstraction is wrong.

8. **Catalog Tools intake is the onboarding path.** New modems come
   through the Catalog Tools pipeline (`/modem-intake` skill or the
   equivalent function calls), not by hand-constructing files.
   Catalog Tools lives in `packages/cable_modem_monitor_catalog_tools/`
   — never installed by HA, but open to contributors with hardware
   and AI assistance (the pipeline mechanics are plain Python; AI
   helps with the judgment layer). The pipeline validates against
   specs end-to-end. Manual construction bypasses that validation.

### Specs and Documentation

9. **Specs are the authority.** Code follows specs. No silent
   deviations. If the code needs to diverge, discuss the gap first,
   update the spec, then update the code.

10. **Design decisions land in specs, not in conversation.** Every
    architectural decision made during a session must be committed to
    the relevant spec file before the session ends. Conversation
    history is ephemeral — specs are durable.

11. **Docs and code move together.** Every core change reconciles the
    affected specs (ARCHITECTURE, ORCHESTRATION_SPEC, MODEM_YAML_SPEC,
    etc.). A code change without a corresponding spec update is
    incomplete.

### Code Quality

12. **No shortcuts, no deferred structure.** If a better design is
    obvious (split by transport, shared types module, DRY utility),
    use it now. Don't optimise for speed of first draft. When a module
    grows past its natural boundary, restructure the whole module —
    don't bolt on the new thing and leave the rest.

13. **Quality gates are not negotiable.** If mypy, ruff, black, or
    pytest fails, fix the code. Don't exclude files, skip checks,
    or weaken thresholds. The only valid exclusions are generated code
    and vendored dependencies. This applies to all linters including
    markdownlint — fix the source files, don't silence rules that
    flag real issues. Only configure away rules that are genuinely
    inapplicable (e.g. line length for URLs, duplicate headings in
    changelogs).

14. **Test overrides are a code smell.** If reaching coverage requires
    heavy mocking, monkeypatching, or test overrides, the code
    structure is wrong. Restructure the code (extract dependency, make
    injectable), don't paper over it with test complexity.

15. **No forward references.** Helper functions that reference a class
    must be defined after the class, not before it.
    `from __future__ import annotations` makes it parse, but the code
    reads wrong.

### Testing

16. **Table-driven tests by default.** Identify the pattern BEFORE
    writing tests, not during review. If 3+ tests share the same
    setup→call→assert structure, start with the table.

17. **Schema tests use fixtures, behavioural tests stay inline.**
    Valid/invalid configs are JSON fixture files (add a file to add a
    test case). Field defaults, access patterns, and state mutations
    are inline tests.

18. **No inline data blobs in test files.** No inline JSON, HTML, or
    multi-line data in test methods. Data comes from fixture files or
    named constants at module top.

19. **No modem-specific references in tests.** Use generic paths and
    names (`Solent Labs`, `T100`, `/status.html`). No cross-boundary
    imports — test data lives inside the package's own `tests/`.

### Process

20. **Only the developer stages files.** Never run `git add`. Show
    the list of changed files and proposed commit message. Let the
    developer stage them.

21. **No external actions without discussion.** Never create GitHub
    issues, PRs, commits, pushes, label changes, or any external-
    facing action without explicit discussion first.

22. **Before deleting or moving ANY file, run `rg <filename>` across
    the entire project.** Files are referenced by non-Python sources
    (CI workflows, Makefiles, docs, VS Code tasks) that linters don't
    scan.

23. **Always read a file before writing to it. No exceptions.** Even
    "I just want to overwrite it" — read first. Local-only/gitignored
    files especially: no git recovery path. The Write tool errors if
    you skip the read; do not work around it.

24. **Stop on placeholders.** When reading code, config, or YAML
    during analysis, halt and flag immediately on `XXX`, `TODO`,
    `FIXME`, `TBD`, `???`, `undefined`, `placeholder`, `replace_me`.
    Do not summarize the surrounding architecture as "looks good"
    while quietly ignoring unfilled values.

25. **Don't offer "revisit later" as an option.** When presenting
    design choices, offer "ratify now" or "drop the idea entirely."
    Never present "keep the ambiguity and revisit later" as a third
    option — deferred items pile up and silently expire.

26. **No "pre-existing" framing.** Don't dismiss code gaps as
    "pre-existing," "not mine," or "from an earlier session." The
    full working tree is in scope unless explicitly narrowed. The
    only valid scope-narrowing reason is *what* the gap is, never
    *who wrote it first*.

27. **Don't claim unverified fixes** in user-facing replies (GitHub
    issues, comments). Use hedged language: "should address," "ready
    to test," "if it works, please post diagnostics." Only claim
    "fixed" after the user confirms on their hardware.

## Diagnosis Discipline

When a runtime error appears in user-supplied logs, **ask for the data
that would distinguish candidate causes before generating theories.**
Typically the surrounding ±10 log lines. Don't theorize first; don't
propose fixes first.

- **Differential test**: every theory must answer "why now and not
  before?" If it can't, it's incomplete — don't commit to a fix
  built on it.
- **User hypotheses are primary evidence**, not options among yours.
  Tentative phrasing ("if we... maybe this...") doesn't downgrade
  the signal — the user has runtime context the codebase doesn't.
- **External failure modes are invisible to grep.** Install path,
  network path, runtime config, user actions — none of those show
  up in codebase searches. When stuck inside the repo, ask: "could
  this be coming from outside the code?"
- **Don't propose fixes until you can name what specifically broke
  and why.** "Probably X" is not a fix-ready diagnosis.

## Decision Discipline

- **One thing at a time.** Surface decisions sequentially; don't
  dump 6-row tables of "outstanding work." Long synthesized lists
  are too much to absorb in one pass and let shortcuts slip
  through.
- **No judgment shortcuts.** Don't dismiss alternatives with
  "overkill," "churn," "make-work," or "no cohesion payoff" without
  weighing real costs and benefits. The shortcut costs more later —
  either a missed improvement or a re-litigated decision.
- **Know what you know — don't speculate.** Model what we actually
  observe; stop there. Don't add inference-based features when the
  signal is ambiguous (multi-signal voting, tunable thresholds, etc.
  are tells).
- **Park side investigations.** When a parallel audit returns
  results, summarize and surface as a *separate* task. Don't merge
  the punch list into the active commit batch without explicit
  ratification.
- **Avoid refactor thrashing.** After 1–2 "this smells" rounds on
  the same module, stop and ask for the end state. If rounds 1 and
  2 haven't converged, round 3 won't either — the underlying issue
  is the goal isn't clear, not that the current location is wrong.
- **Don't defer obvious cosmetic fixes.** If a review surfaces a
  real issue (stale name, drifted docstring, minor nit), fix it in
  the current pass. *"Whenever we say we should take care of
  something later, we do not, and that adds to hidden tech debt."*
  Never write "separate pass if desired" — that's deferral dressed
  as a suggestion.

## Verification Discipline

- **Verify against ground truth, not against doc claims.** When
  asked to review a planning doc / status doc / roadmap, summarize
  what's *actually true* (check code, git, issues), not what the
  doc *says*.
- **Verify the premise before creating a worktree.** For any task
  that says "remove X" or "clean up Y," `rg` for it on the current
  branch first. Zero hits means the work is already done — stop
  before spinning up a worktree.
- **Verify handoff work.** Other Claude sessions on the same
  worktree may regress earlier work. After a handoff, run the full
  pipeline (mock-server / golden-file / channel counts) — don't
  just check tests pass. Tests passing doesn't mean the right
  things are being tested.
- **Recurring problem = root cause unfixed.** If a fix has to be
  re-applied within one session, stop fixing the symptom and find
  what's recreating the failure.
- **Never dismiss test failures as "pre-existing."** If tests pass
  on committed code but fail with working-tree changes, it's a
  regression. Stash and verify on clean state before claiming
  pre-existing.
- **Done means done.** When a task is class-scoped ("all issue
  templates," "all parser docstrings"), apply the criteria
  consistently to every member. Pass-through skimming for one
  specific issue isn't done.
- **Commit before recording done.** Work must be committed to a
  durable branch before journal/memory says "done," "added," or
  "implemented." Stashed work on a worktree branch is one
  `git gc` away from loss.
- **Run pyright alongside mypy.** `mypy` and Pyright (Pylance) have
  different strictness. Code passing mypy can still show red
  squiggles in VS Code. After mypy, run `.venv/bin/pyright`.

## Catalog & Data Discipline

- **No modem-specific behavior in `modem.yaml`.** YAML contains how
  to *talk to* the modem (transport, auth, session, actions,
  hardware metadata, parser mappings) — not how Core processes
  responses. No behavior flags, no per-modem timing knobs.
- **Recovery logic stays generic.** One shared recovery primitive
  for all post-disruption polling, regardless of trigger
  (commanded, observed outage, reboot-signal vote). No per-modem
  recovery tuning.
- **HAR intake is the only data path.** When a user's modem isn't
  matching the catalog, the default ask is a fresh HAR — not
  one-off questions ("what URL is in your address bar?"). HAR is
  reproducible, auditable, and feeds the catalog_tools pipeline.
  Fall back to direct questions only if `har-capture` genuinely
  can't capture what's needed.
- **Verified JSON must be faithful.** `modem.verified.json` is a
  faithful copy of the HA diagnostics `data` section — not a
  curated subset. Keep all modem data verbatim. Strip only:
  `home_assistant`, `custom_components`, `integration_manifest`,
  `setup_times`, `_solentlabs`, `_review_before_sharing`,
  `recent_logs`. Add `verified_at` and `version` at top.
- **Source all factual claims.** Every factual claim in data files
  (`providers.json`, `chipsets.json`, modem.yaml notes/sources)
  must include a reference URL or citation. Without a source, the
  claim is indistinguishable from fabricated data. If a source
  can't be found, leave the field empty rather than guessing.

## Code Discipline (extends Core Principles)

- **TDD for non-trivial bug fixes.** (1) Read relevant specs.
  (2) Document the use case if missing. (3) Write tests that fail.
  (4) Implement. (5) Verify tests pass.
- **Keep WHY comments on refactor.** Don't strip section markers
  (`# Phase 1 — auth`), rationale notes, or numbered-procedure
  markers during a rewrite. The "default to no comments" rule
  targets WHAT-noise, not WHY-context.
- **Isolate before sprawl.** If a feature would touch >2 files,
  it probably needs its own module. Spreading wiring across
  `button.py`, `sensor.py`, `coordinator.py`, and `__init__.py`
  for one concern is the smell.
- **Small files are fine** when (a) the logic is clearly bounded
  (one concern, one reason to change) and (b) the file has a clear
  docstring explaining what lives there. A 50-line file with one
  clear concern beats a 50-line addition to a `utils.py` dumping
  ground.
- **Type-safety patterns:**
  - `Literal[...]` for params with fixed valid values, not `str`
  - `Model.model_validate(data)` for Pydantic from dicts, not `Model(**data)`
  - `@functools.lru_cache` for JSON file caching, not global `dict | None` with manual checks
  - `Any` for pass-through `*args/**kwargs`, not `object`
  - `dict[str, Any]` for JSON data, not `dict[str, object]`
- **Use existing pipelines.** Never hand-build artifacts when a
  pipeline tool exists. `generate_golden_file()` runs the real
  parser coordinator. Serialize with
  `json.dumps(..., indent=2, sort_keys=True, ensure_ascii=False) + "\n"`.
- **Docstring placeholders.** In docstring examples, use template
  placeholders (`{manufacturer}/{model}/`), not specific fake names
  (`acme/a100/`). Tests still use concrete strings; docstrings
  describe the pattern.
- **No P-numbers in public artifacts.** Roadmap identifiers (`P28`,
  `P34`, etc.) come from an internal roadmap doc that ships only
  locally. Tag annotations, CHANGELOG entries, GitHub release notes,
  and issue replies cite GitHub issue numbers, not roadmap Pxx.

## Shell Command Generation - Avoid Permission Check Triggers

When generating shell commands:

1. **Never embed newlines or `#` characters inside quoted strings** passed as command arguments
2. **For multiline shell logic**, write to a `.sh` script file first, then execute the file
3. **Prefer simple, single-line commands** with explicit arguments
4. **For complex logic**, use a heredoc written to a temp file rather than inline quoted strings
5. **Before executing any shell command**, verify it contains no newline characters inside quoted strings and no `#` characters that could be interpreted as hidden arguments

**Why?** Claude Code's permission checker flags quoted newlines followed by `#`-prefixed lines as potential shell injection. Restructuring commands eliminates the interrupt.

## Code Review Criteria

See [`docs/CODE_REVIEW.md`](docs/CODE_REVIEW.md) for full code review standards including:

- **Design Principles**: DRY, Separation of Concerns, SOLID
- **Source File Standards**: Docstrings, type hints, async patterns
- **Test File Standards**: Table-driven tests, coverage requirements
- **Error Handling**: Consistent patterns, meaningful messages
- **Naming Conventions**: Files, classes, functions, constants

## Pre-Push Verification - ALWAYS Run Before Push

Before pushing ANY commits, run the canonical local CI mirror:

```bash
make validate-ci
```

This runs lint + format + type-check + tests + intake regression +
PII check + catalog README freshness — the same surface CI's Tests
workflow exercises. If `make validate-ci` is green, CI will be green.
`scripts/release.py` runs it automatically before every version bump.

**Why?** CI runs on the entire project. Pre-commit hooks only check
staged files, and `make test` is a subset of CI. `make validate-ci`
is the only command guaranteed to mirror CI exactly.

### Adding a new CI job — local-mirror rule

**Whenever you add a new job or step to `.github/workflows/tests.yml`,
add a corresponding Makefile target and wire it into `make
validate-ci` as a dependency.** Every CI check must have a
local-mirror command. The two together are a single change, not a CI
change with a "follow up" Makefile change. Drift between CI and local
is what hides regressions until tag time (see alpha.17 retrospective).

Exceptions: external GitHub Actions that can't be reasonably
reproduced locally (e.g., `home-assistant/actions/hassfest@master`,
which requires HA core source and Docker). Document the exception in
the Makefile comment so future-you knows why `validate-ci` doesn't
cover it.

## Git LFS - HAR Test Fixtures

HAR captures (`.har` files) are stored in Git LFS. They are write-once
test fixtures that grow with each new modem.

### Loading HAR files

Always use `load_har_json()` from `cable_modem_monitor_core.har`:

```python
from solentlabs.cable_modem_monitor_core.har import load_har_json

har_data = load_har_json(path)
```

**Never use raw `json.loads(path.read_text())`** for HAR files. The
shared loader detects LFS pointers and attempts `git lfs pull`
automatically. Without it, missing LFS setup produces opaque
`JSONDecodeError` instead of actionable guidance.

**Exception:** Standalone scripts that intentionally avoid Core as a
dependency (e.g., `check_fixture_pii.py`) should inline the check:

```python
if content.startswith("version https://git-lfs.github.com/spec/v1"):
    # handle LFS pointer
```

### CI workflows

Add `lfs: true` to `actions/checkout` in any CI job that reads HAR
file content (tests, PII checks). Jobs that only lint, validate
manifests, or check versions do not need it.

### Developer setup

`git-lfs` must be installed before cloning. See
[Getting Started](docs/setup/GETTING_STARTED.md) for setup instructions.

## Log Messages - [MODEL] Tag

Runtime log messages for a specific modem include the `[MODEL]` tag
at the end of the subject phrase, before the separator (`:` or `—`):

```python
_logger.info("Parse complete [%s]: %d DS, %d US", model, ds, us)
_logger.debug("Fetched /path [%s]: 200 (1234 bytes)", model)
```

Auth success logging belongs in the **collector**, not in individual
auth managers — the collector has the model name and logs the
`AuthResult` centrally.

## Async/Blocking I/O - Home Assistant Event Loop

When calling sync functions from async code (e.g., in `config_flow.py`, `__init__.py`):

1. **Check if the function does I/O** - file reads, network calls, subprocess
2. **If yes, wrap in executor**: `await hass.async_add_executor_job(sync_func, args)`

```python
# BAD - blocks event loop
adapter = get_auth_adapter_for_parser(parser_name)  # reads YAML files

# GOOD - runs in thread pool
adapter = await hass.async_add_executor_job(get_auth_adapter_for_parser, parser_name)
```

**Why?** HA will warn at runtime ("Detected blocking call...") but catching it during development is better. Ruff can't detect this when the blocking call is inside another function.

## Test Patterns

See [`docs/CODE_REVIEW.md`](docs/CODE_REVIEW.md) for table-driven test
patterns, fixture conventions, and coverage requirements.

Reference implementation: `tests/modem_config/test_modem_yaml_validation.py`.

## Irreversible Operations - STOP and VERIFY

When the user gives explicit constraints (e.g., "without closing the PR", "don't delete X"):

1. **Treat these as HARD BLOCKERS** - not suggestions
2. **Research/verify the outcome BEFORE executing** - if unsure, ASK first
3. **If something goes wrong, STOP and ask** - don't try to fix it autonomously
4. **Never assume** - GitHub branch renames, force pushes, deletions can have cascading effects

Examples of irreversible operations requiring verification:

- Branch renames, deletions, force pushes
- PR/issue closures
- Tag deletions
- Any git operation with `--force`

## Branch Management - Rebase Over Cherry-Pick

When applying a fix to multiple feature branches (e.g., v3.11.0 and v3.12.0):

1. **Commit the fix to the base branch first** (e.g., v3.11.0)
2. **Rebase the child branch** onto the updated parent: `git checkout feature/v3.12.0 && git rebase feature/v3.11.0`
3. **Force push the rebased branch**: `git push --force-with-lease`

**Why not cherry-pick?** Cherry-pick creates duplicate commits with different SHAs. When branches merge to main, you get duplicate history or merge conflicts.

**Exception:** Cherry-pick is fine for backporting to unrelated branches (e.g., hotfix to an old release).

## Merge Strategy

### Release branches → main: Use merge commits (not squash)

- Preserves release branch history
- Child branches rebase cleanly without "skipped commit" noise
- Shows clear release boundaries in git log

### Small PRs (single feature/fix): Squash merge is fine

- Creates one clean commit on main

## Release Process

See [`docs/reference/RELEASING.md`](docs/reference/RELEASING.md) for
the full step-by-step release process (beta, stable).

Key rules:

- **CI runs on push. Publishing runs on tag push.** Don't skip the tag.
- **NEVER manually edit version numbers.** Use `scripts/release.py`.
- **NEVER run `gh release create` manually.** Let CI handle it.
- **Dogfood on local HA** before stable releases (user launches, not automated).

## PR and Issue Rules

**NEVER use "Closes #X", "Fixes #X", or similar auto-close keywords.**

- This applies to **both PR bodies AND commit messages**
- GitHub scans all commit messages in a merge — a `Fixes #X` buried in any commit on the branch will auto-close the issue when merged to main
- Users should close their own tickets after confirming fixes work
- Use "Related to #X" or "Addresses #X" instead

## Issue Labels

State labels (`needs-triage`, `in-development`, `needs-testing`,
`needs-data`, `backlog`) are mutually exclusive — exactly one
applies. Same for `release:vX.Y` labels. Everything else stacks.

- `needs-triage` — auto-applied; replace with a real state on first read
- `in-development` — code being written or in an unreleased branch
- `needs-testing` — released and installable; user can verify now
- `needs-data` — waiting on user for HAR / diagnostics / clarification
- `backlog` — acknowledged, not actively prioritized

**Don't apply `needs-testing` until the code is released.** A parser
on an unreleased branch is `in-development` even when complete.

Apply `release:vX.Y` when the work is committed to that release
(branch cut, or merged). All `release:vX.Y` descriptions read
"Tagged for vX.Y."

When a user confirms a modem parser works on real hardware, promote
the modem per
[`MODEM_DIRECTORY_SPEC.md`](packages/cable_modem_monitor_core/docs/MODEM_DIRECTORY_SPEC.md#promotion-procedure).
