## 1. Research Assistance Workflow

### Topic Development Phase
1. **Research Question Refinement**: Help users develop clear, focused research questions
2. **Literature Search Strategy**: Suggest search terms, databases, and research approaches
3. **Source Evaluation**: Assess credibility, relevance, and academic rigor of potential sources
4. **Gap Analysis**: Identify what's missing in current literature and research opportunities

### Content Development Phase
1. **Outline Development**: Use structured outlines to guide logical argument progression
2. **Section-by-Section Writing**: Provide detailed guidance for each paper section
3. **Evidence Integration**: Help weave sources and citations into coherent arguments
4. **Academic Tone**: Ensure professional, objective, and scholarly writing throughout

### Quality Assurance Phase
1. **Fact-Checking**: Verify all claims, statistics, and assertions against original sources
2. **Citation Validation**: Ensure all in-text citations have corresponding reference entries
3. **Academic Standards**: Review for proper academic tone, structure, and argumentation
4. **Style Compliance**: Apply appropriate citation style consistently throughout

## 2. Core Principles
- All contributors must follow the outline-driven, style-agnostic workflow described in `DECISIONS.md`.
- Outlines in `outlines/` define only structure (section order/names/instructions). Style, citation, and formatting are enforced by the corresponding file in `guidelines/` (e.g., `apa7.md`, `ieee.md`, `mla.md`).
- Never hardcode style rules in outlines or templates.
- Do not change `input_requirements.md` in any paper folder if it exists.
- Document all major changes in `DECISIONS.md`.
- **Do not include workflow, methodology, or template details (such as recursive template-driven structure) in the academic paper itself. These belong only in repository documentation, not in the paper content.**

## 3. Academic Paper Workflow (Summary)
1. **Define Requirements:**
   - Review or create `input_requirements.md` in the paper folder.
2. **Select Outline:**
   - Use `input_requirements.md` to select the correct outline from `outlines/`.
3. **Draft Sections:**
   - Generate content for each section in order, using outline instructions and style guidelines.
4. **References:**
   - Add all cited sources to the References section at the end of `paper.md` in the required style.
5. **Peer Review & Checklist:**
   - Review each section for quality and compliance. Complete `CHECKLIST.md` before assembly/export.
6. **Assembly & Export:**
   - Assemble sections in outline order. Apply style rules. Export as `.docx` using `convert_to_word.py` (the clean, simple converter). Do not export if required sections are missing.
   - Command: `python convert_to_word.py <paper_folder>`
7. **Final Validation:**
   - Ensure all requirements are met and no content from other folders is included.
8. **Writing Quality:**
   - Write clear, fact-checked, publication-ready content with in-text citations and references in the required style.
9. **Final Review:**
   - Check formatting, references, and remove any instructional/outline text before submission.
10. **Finalize Checklist:**
    - Mark all items in `CHECKLIST.md` as complete.
11. **Final Submission:**
    - Confirm the paper is ready for submission or export, and perform the final submission step as required by your workflow or repository guidelines.
12. **Configure Export Script:**
    - Use the clean `convert_to_word.py` script for reliable Word document generation.
    - Always execute via `run_in_terminal` tool: `python convert_to_word.py <folder_name>`

## Recursive Section Structure for Case Studies and Similar Sections

If your paper includes multiple case studies (or other repeated section types), each section should be structured using the relevant template and guidelines (e.g., Title, Description, Analysis, Discussion, Conclusion for case studies). This ensures consistency and standards compliance for all repeated sections.

When generating or reviewing outlines, always check for sections that represent repeated units (such as case studies, experiments, or profiles) and apply the appropriate template recursively within those sections.

**Important:** The use of recursive, template-driven structures is a workflow and documentation requirement only. Do not mention or discuss workflow, methodology, or template structure in the academic paper itself. The paper should focus solely on its substantive academic content.
