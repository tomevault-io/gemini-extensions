# Madhuban Garden Resort Website

## Scope

These instructions apply to the entire repository rooted at this directory.

## Project Overview

- Build a full-stack resort website for **Madhuban Garden Resort** in **Agar Malwa District, Madhya Pradesh, India**.
- Domain: `madhubangarden.com`
- This is a client project. Build clean, production-grade code. No shortcuts.

## Current Build Phase

- **Phase 1: Frontend with dummy data only**
- Build all pages with static or dummy data first.
- Do not connect the real database yet.
- Do not integrate real payments yet.
- Goal: get the full UI approved by the client before backend work begins.

## UI Design Reference

- All screen designs, layouts, and visual references are inside the `/UI design/` folder at the project root.
- Before building any page or component, open and read the relevant file in `/UI design/` first.
- Match the design as closely as possible.
- Do not invent layouts that are not in the design files.

## Amenities

## Major Selling Point

- Wedding Venue is the number one revenue driver.
- The `/wedding` page must be the most polished and detailed page on the site.
- Feature the wedding offering prominently on the homepage.
- Use emotional language appropriately.
- Show venue photos, capacity, and packages in the final implementation.

## Booking System

Planned booking flow:

1. User selects room plus check-in and check-out dates
2. System checks availability via `/api/availability` and Supabase later
3. User fills guest details: name, phone, email
4. User chooses payment method:
   - Pay Now: Razorpay checkout, webhook confirms, booking saved
   - Pay at Reception: booking saved with `pending` status
5. Show confirmation on screen and send email via Resend

### Payment Requirements

- Gateway: Razorpay
- Support UPI, Cards, Net Banking, Wallets
- Webhook route: `/api/payments/webhook`

## iCal Sync Requirements

- Do not use Djubo or any paid channel manager.
- Build a custom iCal-based sync system.
- Our system must expose an iCal feed at `madhubangarden.com/api/ical/export`
- Booking.com and MMT will pull this feed from their extranets
- Our system will pull iCal feeds from Booking.com and MMT every 30 minutes
- Sync will run via Vercel Cron Job at `/api/cron/sync-ical`
- Use `node-ical` to parse incoming feeds
- Use `ical-generator` to generate outgoing feeds
- Cache availability in Upstash Redis

## Planned Database Schema

```sql
rooms (
  id, slug, name, type, description,
  price_per_night, capacity, images[],
  amenities[], is_active
)

bookings (
  id, room_id, guest_name, guest_phone, guest_email,
  check_in, check_out, guests_count,
  payment_method, payment_status, razorpay_order_id,
  source (website/booking_com/mmt/manual),
  status (confirmed/pending/cancelled),
  created_at
)

inquiries (
  id, name, phone, email,
  event_type (wedding/birthday/corporate/other),
  event_date, guests_count, message,
  status (new/contacted/closed),
  created_at
)

blocked_dates (
  id, room_id, date, source (ical/manual)
)

gallery (
  id, image_url, category (rooms/wedding/events/pool/restaurant),
  caption, sort_order
)

reviews (
  id, guest_name, rating, review_text,
  source (google/manual), created_at
)
```

## Admin Dashboard

Protect `/admin` using Supabase Auth with email plus OTP login.

Sections to build later:

- Bookings: view all, filter by date/status/source, update status
- Availability: calendar view, manually block/unblock dates
- Inquiries: view all wedding and event inquiries, mark as contacted
- Gallery: upload, delete, reorder images
- Rooms: edit room details, pricing, images
- iCal Sync: show last sync time, manual trigger button, sync logs
