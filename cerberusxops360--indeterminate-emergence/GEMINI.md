## What This Repo Is

A security framework and proof-of-concept implementation for **indeterminate emergence** — a primitive where meaningful information, capabilities, and effects do not exist outside authorized execution contexts. The framework extends deniable encryption concepts to real-time system behavior, using Pufferfish-style privacy definitions and differential privacy composition to provide formal guarantees against capability inference attacks.

This is an open research project. The repo contains:
1. The academic paper (markdown, LaTeX, PDF)
2. A blog post (plain-language explanation)
3. A proof-of-concept proxy service demonstrating AI capability-set inference resistance
4. Evaluation experiments with quantitative results

## ADAM Integration

### Object Types

This repo introduces the following ADAM-managed object types:

```
RESEARCH_PAPER
  fingerprint: SHA-256 of paper markdown content
  tier: T1 (warm — actively edited during revision cycles)
  relationships: PRODUCES blog_post, SPECIFIES poc_system
  status: draft | submitted | published | revised

BLOG_POST
  fingerprint: SHA-256 of blog markdown content
  tier: T1 (warm — actively edited during publication cycle)
  relationships: DERIVED_FROM research_paper, PUBLISHED_TO platform_id

POC_COMPONENT
  fingerprint: SHA-256 of source file content
  tier: T1 (warm — actively developed)
  relationships: IMPLEMENTS paper_section, DEPENDS_ON component_id

EVAL_EXPERIMENT
  fingerprint: SHA-256 of experiment script + config
  tier: T1 (warm — actively running)
  relationships: VALIDATES paper_claim, USES poc_component

EVAL_RESULT
  fingerprint: SHA-256 of result data
  tier: T2 (cool — reference data, changes only on re-run)
  relationships: PRODUCED_BY eval_experiment, VALIDATES paper_claim

SUBMISSION_RECORD
  fingerprint: SHA-256 of submission metadata JSON
  tier: T3 (cold — changes only on new submission)
  relationships: SUBMITS research_paper, TARGETS venue_id
```

### Fingerprint Format

Standard ADAM format: `fp-{type}-{YYYYMMDD}-{8hex}-{4hex}`

Type codes for this repo:
```
rpap  — research paper
blog  — blog post
pocc  — proof of concept component
eval  — evaluation experiment
evrs  — evaluation result
subm  — submission record
```

Example: `fp-rpap-20260313-a7b3c9d2-e4f5`

### Manifest Entries

Every versioned artifact gets a manifest entry. Paper versions are tracked by content hash — if the hash changes, a new fingerprint is minted and the old version tiers down (T1 → T2 → T3). ADAM never deletes, only tiers down.

**Follow this structure exactly.** Do not create files outside this tree without updating this document first.

## How to Work

1. **Read the relevant specification BEFORE writing code.** The PoC specification (`docs/POC_SPECIFICATION.md`) is the TDP for this repo. If code contradicts the spec, the code is wrong.

2. **Write tests FIRST, then implementation.** Tests define the contract. Every `src/` module has a corresponding `tests/test_*.py` file.

3. **Every new file gets an ADAM manifest entry.** Compute SHA-256 of content, assign fingerprint, add to `manifest/index.yaml`.

4. **Commit after each logical unit of work.** Descriptive messages. Format: `[component] description` — e.g., `[channel_shaper] implement fixed-size response padding`.

5. **Push immediately.** Do not accumulate uncommitted work.

6. **`git status` at session start.** Confirm clean working tree before beginning new work.

7. **Set git identity at session start:**
   ```bash
   git config user.name "Adam Bishop"
   git config user.email "adam@xops360.com"
   ```

8. **KNOWN_ISSUES.md-first debugging.** If you encounter a bug, log it in KNOWN_ISSUES.md before attempting a fix. If the fix works, remove the entry and commit both the fix and the KNOWN_ISSUES.md update.

9. **Pin all dependencies.** No floating versions in requirements.txt. Every package gets an exact version.

10. **No silent failures.** Every function either returns a result or raises an exception with a clear message. The proxy endpoint always returns HTTP 200 — but internal logging must capture all errors.

## Writing Standards

This repo contains public-facing written content (paper, blog post). All written content MUST comply with XOps360 Voice & Writing Standards:

### Banned Words (Tier 1 — Auto-Replace)
- leverage → use
- utilize → use  
- streamline → simplify / speed up
- comprehensive → [delete or replace with specific scope]
- robust → [replace with actual engineering characteristic]

### Banned Patterns
- Maximum ONE em dash per document
- No "Furthermore" or "Moreover" — ever
- No "However" more than once per 500 words
- No tricolon reflex (groups of three where two or four work better)
- No summary sandwich (introduce → say → summarize)
- No Wikipedia openers ("In the rapidly evolving field of...")

### Claude-Specific Patterns to Avoid
- "That's a great question" / "That's an interesting point"
- "It's worth noting" / "It bears mentioning"
- Reflexive both-sides presentation
- "Let me break this down"
- Parenthetical qualification overuse
- The word "epistemic" in any non-mathematical context (use in formal definitions only, never in prose explanations or the blog post)

### Academic Exception
The paper uses formal mathematical language. Terms like "indistinguishability," "composition," and "adversary" are domain-standard and not AI tells. The blog post is held to STRICT filter level. The paper is held to MODERATE — banned words apply, but technical structure and formalism are expected.

## Infrastructure

### Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.11+
- **Web framework:** FastAPI + Uvicorn
- **Evaluation:** NumPy, SciPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib
- **Testing:** pytest
- **No cloud infrastructure.** The PoC runs locally. No Cloudflare, no D1, no R2 for this repo.

### Local Development
```bash
# Setup
cd C:\Projects\active\indeterminate-emergence
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r poc/requirements.txt

# Run proxy
cd poc
uvicorn src.proxy:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# Run tests
pytest poc/tests/ -v

# Run evaluations (proxy must be running)
python -m eval.divergence_test
python -m eval.classifier_attack
python -m eval.budget_depletion
```

## What NOT to Do

- Do not use the word "epistemic" in the blog post, README, or any prose explanation. Reserve it for formal mathematical definitions in the paper only.
- Do not use banned words from the writing standards in any file that leaves this repo (paper, blog, README).
- Do not create cloud infrastructure. This is a local-only project.
- Do not add real API integrations to the PoC tools. All tools are simulated.
- Do not expose the privacy accountant's internal state in HTTP responses. Ever.
- Do not return HTTP status codes other than 200 from the proxy. The whole point is uniform responses.
- Do not use floating dependency versions. Pin everything.
- Do not skip manifest entries for new files. Every file gets a fingerprint.
- Do not commit evaluation results without a corresponding entry in CHANGELOG.md.
- Do not modify the paper without updating the fingerprint in the manifest.
