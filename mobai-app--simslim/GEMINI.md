# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

simslim runs many more iOS simulators on one Mac by disabling the background
daemons a simulator doesn't need, cutting each simulator's memory ~4x. It is a Go
CLI plus a SwiftUI macOS app that wraps it. Everything is driven through
`xcrun simctl`; the tool only ever touches the simulators you point it at, never
the host Mac. macOS-only.

## Commands

```sh
go build ./cmd/simslim          # build the CLI
go test ./...                   # run all tests (Makefile: make test)
go test -run TestName ./...     # run a single test
make check                      # full CI gate — must pass before a PR
make format                     # gofmt + swift-format (run before committing)
make app                        # build build/SimSlim.app (Go + swiftc, macOS only)
open build/SimSlim.app
```

`make check` runs `go test`, `go vet`, `swift-format lint --strict --recursive gui`,
`zsh -n scripts/build-app.sh`, and `plutil -lint gui/Info.plist`. CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
runs exactly this on macos-26 / Xcode 26.6, then builds and verifies the app bundle.

Tests are pure unit tests (parsing, delta logic, allowlist invariants) — they do
**not** boot real simulators, so they run anywhere. Only the app build and manual
runs need Xcode + an iOS runtime.

## Architecture

Two packages. The repo root is `package simslim`, an importable library holding
every piece of slimming logic and **no external dependencies**. `cmd/simslim/`
is `package main`, the CLI: `main.go` dispatches `os.Args[1]` to a `cmd*`
function per subcommand and enforces macOS-only up front.

Anything that talks to a terminal — printing, `--json` encoding via `writeJSON`,
the interactive wizard in `wizard.go`, `fatal()`, `usage()` — lives in
`cmd/simslim/`. The library never writes to stdout; it returns values and
reports progress through the `Reporter` callback the caller supplies.

Exported identifiers in the root package are the public API, so renaming one is
a breaking change for importers as well as for the CLI.

**The slimming model (the core idea).** `profiles.go` defines `Categories`, an
allowlist of launchd daemon labels grouped by user-facing feature (siri, search,
icloud, …). Categories may overlap — a label lives in every category whose
feature needs it (e.g. the AMS payment-sheet daemons are in both `store` and
`icloud`), and `Profile.Desired()` keeps a label enabled when **any** excepted
category lists it. `SlimmableSet()` is the deduplicated union of every label in
`Categories`.
`managedSet()` adds each category's `AlwaysEnabled` compatibility services,
which simslim may only repair back to enabled; these are **the only labels the
tool may ever disable or enable.** Anything outside those sets is never touched.
`service_descriptions.go` supplies the short per-daemon explanations shown by
the GUI; its coverage and length are enforced in `profiles_test.go`.
`profile_file.go` loads a committed JSON profile (`simslim on --profile <path>`)
whose `except`/`keep` arrays mirror the flags of the same name, validates it
against the allowlist, and resolves it to a `Profile`. The dependency-free
`profile` command's interactive wizard lives in `cmd/simslim/wizard.go`.
`features.go` defines `Features`, a finer-grained catalog than `Categories`:
each feature (push, storekit, universal-links, …) names just the daemons one
testable capability needs. `doctor` reads a booted simulator's disabled labels
and reports any required feature whose daemons are down, exiting non-zero — a CI
preflight. `features_test.go` asserts every feature label is slimmable.
`slim.go`'s `ensure()` rejects a non-empty slim profile on runtimes older than
iOS 18.5 before booting or mutating the device, then reads the currently disabled
labels, computes a `delta` against the desired set, and applies the changes with
`launchctl disable/enable` run inside the simulator via `simctl spawn`, a pool of
`spawnWorkers` (8) at a time. It reboots
and reads the state back before reporting persistence. `on` disables the profile;
`off` remains available on every runtime and re-enables the whole managed set.
`EnableSlimNoReboot` (`on --no-reboot`) skips the reboot: it runs `launchctl
disable` + `launchctl bootout` per label so the daemon stops in the current boot
session, which is the only slimming possible on runtimes older than iOS 18.5.

**The offline fast path.** On a runtime with persistent overrides `ensureOffline`
takes over: `disabled_store.go` writes the overrides directly and boots the
device once, already slim, skipping every `launchctl` spawn *and* the reboot that
would apply them (measured 2m14s → 33s for 170 labels). A **booted** device gets
there too — an override only takes effect at the next boot, so `ensure` reads its
live state, returns early when the profile already matches, and otherwise spends
the shutdown the device already owed before handing off. There is no shell inside
any iOS runtime (`RuntimeRoot/bin` holds only `df` and `launchctl`), so batching
transitions through a spawned `/bin/sh` is not an option; the pool is. `launchd_sim` is a *host* process, so that store is not in the
device's data directory — it sits beside the device's `launchd.log` in
`/private/var/tmp/com.apple.CoreSimulator.SimDevice.<UDID>/disabled.plist`, keyed
only by UDID. It is an undocumented CoreSimulator detail, so treat it as
best-effort: writes **merge** (the runtime keeps its own explicit-enable entries
there, and unmanaged labels are never simslim's business), the booted device is
always read back with `print-disabled` rather than trusted, and anything that
does not work out returns `errOfflineIneffective` so `ensure` falls back to the
`launchctl` path. A store problem must never surface as a command failure.

**simctl wrapper.** `simctl.go` is the only place that shells out to
`xcrun simctl` (list/boot/shutdown/clone/erase/delete/spawn). `measure.go` sums
`phys_footprint` across the simulator's launchd process tree (via `pgrep`/`ps`/`top`)
— that's the memory figure that decides how many simulators fit. `MeasureProcesses`
keeps the per-process detail (footprint + cpu, from the same snapshot) for the
`top` drill-down. `fleet.go`'s `FleetSnapshot` composes booted devices + slim
status + `MeasureMany` into the fleet view; the live TUI is `cmd/simslim/top.go`
(Bubble Tea), which also has a `--json`/non-TTY one-shot fallback. `disk.go`,
`disk_cleanup.go`, and `disk_inventory.go` handle disk measurement and the
separate, permanent disk-cleanup feature.

**JSON is a contract.** Every read-only and management command supports `--json`.
The structs in `output.go` (`DeviceSummary`, `StatusOutput`,
`SimulatorMutationOutput`, etc.) plus the category/plan structs are the stable
interface the SwiftUI app decodes. Changing a JSON field breaks the GUI in
`gui/*.swift` — keep them in sync. `gui/Backend.swift` invokes the bundled CLI
with `--json` and decodes these types; there is no other IPC.

**The SwiftUI app** (`gui/`) has no Xcode project. `scripts/build-app.sh` compiles
the Swift sources directly with `swiftc`, cross-builds the Go CLI, bundles it into
`SimSlim.app/Contents/Resources/simslim`, generates the icon, and ad-hoc codesigns.
The app is a thin front end that shells out to that bundled binary.

## Safety invariants — preserve these

- **Never add a deadlock-prone daemon to `Categories`.** A handful of daemons wedge
  a simulator when disabled. `profiles_test.go` holds a `forbiddenLabels` list and
  asserts none appear in any category; if you add labels, keep that test green.
- **Only managed labels are ever mutated.** `delta()` is scoped to `managedSet()`
  on both sides. Compatibility labels are omitted from every desired slim state,
  so they can only be repaired to enabled.
- **Destructive/management commands resolve the exact UDID first** (`findDevice` /
  `shutdownIfBooted`) so a `simctl` alias like `all` can never fan out a boot,
  erase, delete, or filesystem path across every simulator.
- **Disk cleanup only removes allowlisted per-device directories**, refuses to run
  without `--confirm`, and never touches the shared, signed iOS runtime (built-in
  apps, core OS language resources). `disk-plan` is strictly read-only. Durable
  storage (Documents, app bundles, user media) is measured but never deletable.

## Conventions

- CLI parsing uses `github.com/urfave/cli/v3`; the `top` command's live TUI uses
  `github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea` + `lipgloss`. These are the CLI's only
  dependencies — the root library still has none, so importers never inherit a
  terminal stack. The command tree lives in `cmd/simslim/app.go` (`newApp`);
  each subcommand's `Action` is a `cmd*` function in `cmd/simslim/main.go` that
  reads flags via `cmd.Bool/String(...)` and positionals via `cmd.Args()`. Flags may appear before or after positional args
  (e.g. `simslim on <udid> --except search`) — v3 parses flags anywhere by default.
  `--set` is a global flag (inherited by every subcommand) registered in its flag
  `Action`. `main.go` still owns `version`/`help`/no-args and the macOS-only guard
  before handing off to the tree, and routes every command error through `fatal()`
  for the stable `simslim: <msg>` (exit 1); unknown commands exit 2 with usage.
- Two timeouts live in `simctl.go`: `ShutdownTimeout` (30s, a const) and `BootTimeout`
  (10min, because a first slim reconfigure boots twice). `BootTimeout` is a package var,
  not a const, so the CLI's global `--boot-timeout` flag (env `SIMSLIM_BOOT_TIMEOUT`,
  wired in `app.go` like `--set`) can raise it for slow CI runners where the per-daemon
  `launchctl` transitions would otherwise blow the deadline mid-reconfigure.
- Progress for multi-minute operations goes to **stderr** via the `Reporter` callback;
  machine-readable JSON goes to **stdout**. Under `--json`, suppress the stderr
  chatter so consumers reading a combined stream still get clean JSON.
- Memory estimates (`ApproxMemoryMB`) are iOS-26.5 clean-boot medians and are
  **not additive**. Every category must have a positive measured estimate.
