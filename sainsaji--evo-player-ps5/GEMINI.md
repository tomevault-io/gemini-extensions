# EVO Player

A native media player for jailbroken PS5 (FW 12.70), built against the PS5
Payload SDK and shipped as an app module (`.ffpfsc`, title `PPSA99039`). The UI
is RmlUi on bare-metal `sceAgc`; decode is `sceVideodec2` with an FFmpeg
fallback.

This file holds the rules that are expensive to relearn on real hardware. The
full docs are in `docs/` ([docs/README.md](docs/README.md)). Read the linked
doc before working deep in an area.

**Replies:** Reply in plain, simple words: the result first, then the next step. No tables or extra detail unless I ask.

**Test on the console yourself.** After any fix, run it on the PS5 yourself: `evo-remote.sh quit` → `close` → deploy → `launch`, then drive it with `screen` / `key` / `key l3` + `tools/shot.sh grab` and read the screenshots. Never ask me to test what you can test. → [tooling.md#hardware-cycle](docs/build/tooling.md#hardware-cycle)

Each issue body also has a "References & sequencing" block.

## Rules that must not be broken

- **Never call `make` directly.** The Makefile is missing FFmpeg's transitive
  dependencies. Use `scripts/package-app.sh` for the real build, or
  `scripts/build-evoplayer.sh` for a compile check only.
- **Everything toolchain-related runs in the pinned Docker container.**
  Scripts under `scripts/` and `tools/` re-run themselves through
  `docker compose` when started from Windows. From Git Bash, call
  `docker compose run --rm -e PS5_HOST=... ps5-dev ./tools/...` directly, and
  set `MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1` when you pass a container path.
- **One hardware path: the `.ffpfsc` app module.** Build with `package-app.sh
  --ffpfsc`, deploy with `deploy-app.sh --ffpfsc`, then start it with
  `evo-remote.sh launch`. ShadowMount+ v1.7 does NOT auto-launch an updated
  image. Never push an EVO ELF. For layout questions use the host renderer
  (`uiview.sh`), not the console.
- **Never deploy over a running EVO, and never stack launches.** Both have
  kernel-panicked the console. Close it with `evo-remote.sh quit` (soft close:
  stop media, drain the GPU, park), then `evo-remote.sh close`. `close` is a
  kill, the same as the PS button, so the script only sends it once
  `evo_status` says `parked=1`. Never send the controllers in
  `tools/ps5-controllers/` by hand. A kill while the GPU is still submitting
  panicked the console on 2026-09-18.
- **Lifecycle truth is ShadowMount's `/data/shadowmount/debug.log`**
  (`[GAME] started` / `runtime layers released`), not an exit code. Run one
  cycle at a time, stop at the first anomaly, and never auto-retry.
- **Never sweep kernel `.text`** (`kernel_copyout` over a range). It panics the
  console every time.
- **Never call `sceVideoOutOpen` from a payload.** It returns a bogus handle
  and panics once a compute queue is allocated.
  → [hardware-decode.md](docs/hardware/hardware-decode.md)
- **Do not kill `kstuff`.** It destabilises the console into a panic.
- **The console's `/fs` web route is read-only.** Delete over FTP
  (`tools/shot.sh clean`).
- **Diagnostics: one file, `/mnt/usb0/evo.log`.** It holds the boot trace,
  breadcrumbs, decoder notes and per-file stats. klog gets the same lines live.
  `evo-remote.sh log` pulls it. `evo_status` is the live one-line state
  (`--usb-remote` builds only). A `timeout`/`curl` timeout on an
  `evo-remote.sh` call is a normal, successful outcome.
- **Framebuffer format is `0xAABBGGRR`** (BGRA in memory). Get it wrong and the
  colours swap silently; nothing crashes.

## Quick commands

```bash
# build + deploy (always --usb-remote for testing: enables evo-remote)
docker compose run --rm ps5-dev ./scripts/package-app.sh --ffpfsc --usb-remote
docker compose run --rm ps5-dev ./scripts/deploy-app.sh --ffpfsc   # sha256-verified

# drive the console (PS5_HOST=192.168.0.x)
./tools/evo-remote.sh launch | quit | close | status | log
./tools/evo-remote.sh screen <id> | key <button> | play <path>      # key l3 = screenshot
./tools/shot.sh grab                                                 # -> output/screenshots/latest.png
./tools/evo-remote.sh cycle --secs 60   # whole loop, classified result in output/cycles/

# host UI renderer - any layout question, no console
./tools/uiview.sh --all                 # every RmlUi screen -> output/uiview/rml_*.png
EVO_UIVIEW_IPTV_SWEEP=<m3u> ...         # walk every IPTV group with the D-pad (see the .cpp)

# serve provider bundles / a playlist TO the console - on the HOST, not the container
./tools/provider-server.sh

# compile check only, never deploys
docker compose run --rm ps5-dev ./scripts/build-evoplayer.sh
```

All scripts, screenshot measurement (`shot.sh probe/scan/crop/diff`) and env
vars: [tooling.md](docs/build/tooling.md).

## Repo layout

```
projects/evoplayer/
  main.cpp       entry point only: crash/SIGTERM handlers -> Application::run()
  main.c.legacy  the old monolith. NOT COMPILED. Don't edit it or read it to
                 learn current behaviour; grep core/ instead.
  core/          the player: Application.cpp (frame loop, soft close), screens/,
                 services/ (PlaybackController, settings, metadata)
  media/         decode, audio, evo_agc_runtime.c (GPU present + VideoOut)
  pp/            pace, presentation clock, seek
  ui/            nav/focus/input primitives + evo_keyboard state
  ui_rml/        the RmlUi UI: evo_rmlui_app/bridge/render.cpp, the sceAgc
                 render interface, evo_rmlui_provider*.cpp (provider screens)
  addons/        evo_net (HTTP/TLS), the provider seam, provider_iptv/xtream/
                 emby/jellyfin/nuvio -> docs/addons/provider-architecture.md
  assets/rml/    .rml/.rcss, embedded into the binary at package time
  src/           evo_usb_remote.c (the evo_cmd / evo_status dev remote)
scripts/         build + deploy
tools/           evo-remote, evo_lifecycle.py, ps5-controllers/, uiview, shot, klog
assets/providers/ provider UI bundles, served, not embedded
```

## Key docs

- [tooling.md](docs/build/tooling.md): every script, the hardware cycle, launch safety
- [evo-pro/status.md](docs/evo-pro/status.md): resume here for decode/GPU work
- [memory-budget.md](docs/hardware/memory-budget.md): direct 12 GB, flexible
  448 MB. Read it before calling EVO memory-limited, and check `map_fail` in
  `evo.log` before blaming a codec.
- [agc-bare-metal-ui.md](docs/evo-pro/agc-bare-metal-ui.md) +
  [shader-compilation.md](docs/hardware/shader-compilation.md): the sceAgc UI and the shader toolchain
- [provider-architecture.md](docs/addons/provider-architecture.md): the provider seam (#90)
- [upscaler.md](docs/hardware/upscaler.md): FSR1 / Anime4K (#103)
- [proprietary.md](docs/proprietary.md): licences, including the vendored GPL controllers
- Everything else: [docs/README.md](docs/README.md)

## Working efficiently

- **Read narrow.** `evo_rmlui_app.cpp` (4k lines), `uiview_playback_rml.cpp`
  and `core/Application.cpp` are large. Grep first, then read only that range.
- **Don't re-read a file right after editing it.**
- **Batch console work:** run several `key` presses in one `docker compose run
  ... bash -c`. Each container start costs seconds.
- **On Windows, write multi-line patch scripts to a file and run
  `python3 -X utf8 file.py`.** Heredocs with quotes or em dashes break in Git
  Bash.
