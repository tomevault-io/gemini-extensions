# Cursor Rules — Agentic Engineering Patterns

> Derived from Simon Willison's [Agentic Engineering Patterns](https://simonwillison.net/guides/agentic-engineering-patterns/) and Andrej Karpathy's [LLM coding pitfalls](https://github.com/forrestchang/andrej-karpathy-skills). These rules apply to every task in this repository.

---

## 1. Think Before Coding

Do not assume. Do not hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.

- **State assumptions explicitly.** If you are uncertain about the user's intent, ask before writing code. Never silently pick one interpretation and run with it.
- **Present multiple interpretations** when genuine ambiguity exists. Lay out the options with tradeoffs and let the user decide.
- **Push back when warranted.** If a simpler approach exists, say so. If the request will create unnecessary complexity, flag it.
- **Stop when confused.** Name exactly what is unclear and ask a targeted clarifying question. Do not produce speculative code to "figure it out."

---

## 2. Simplicity First

Write the minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No premature "flexibility" or "configurability" that was not requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If 200 lines could be 50, rewrite it as 50.
- Prefer boring, well-understood technology over novel approaches unless the user specifies otherwise.

**Self-check:** Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated? If yes, simplify.

---

## 3. Surgical Changes

Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.

When editing existing code:
- Do NOT "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting that is unrelated to the task.
- Do NOT refactor things that are not broken.
- Match the existing code style, even if you would write it differently in a greenfield project.
- If you notice unrelated dead code or issues, mention them in your response — do NOT silently delete or fix them.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports, variables, and functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Do NOT remove pre-existing dead code unless explicitly asked.

**Self-check:** Every changed line must trace directly to the user's request. If it does not, revert it.

---

## 4. Red/Green Test-Driven Development

Every implementation MUST follow strict red/green TDD. No exceptions.

### The Protocol

1. **Write tests FIRST** that describe the desired behavior.
2. **Run the tests and confirm they FAIL** (the RED phase). If they pass already, the tests are not exercising new behavior — rewrite them.
3. **Implement the minimum code** to make the failing tests pass (the GREEN phase).
4. **Run all tests** to confirm nothing is broken.
5. **Refactor** only after all tests pass, and re-run tests after refactoring.

### What This Means in Practice

- "Add validation" becomes "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass."
- "Fix the bug" becomes "Write a test that reproduces the bug, then make it pass."
- "Refactor X" becomes "Ensure all tests pass before AND after the refactor."
- Never write implementation code without a failing test that demands it.

### Test Quality Standards

- Tests must be independent and deterministic (no test ordering dependencies, no flaky timing).
- Test names must describe the behavior under test, not the implementation.
- Each test should verify one logical assertion or closely related group of assertions.
- Include edge cases: empty inputs, boundary values, error conditions, unicode, large payloads.
- Prefer integration tests for API endpoints and unit tests for pure logic.

---

## 5. First Run the Tests

At the start of every session against an existing codebase:

1. **Run the full test suite first** before making any changes. This gives you baseline knowledge of the project's health, its size, and its test patterns.
2. **Use the test suite to learn the codebase.** Tests are executable documentation; read them to understand expected behavior.
3. **After every change, run the full test suite** to confirm no regressions.

If the project uses Python: `uv run pytest` or `pytest`.
If the project uses Node: `npm test` or `npx jest`.
If unsure, look at `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `Makefile`, or CI config to discover the test command.

---

## 6. Agentic Manual Testing

Automated tests are necessary but not sufficient. After tests pass, manually verify the feature works end-to-end.

- For Python libraries: use `python -c "..."` to exercise functions with realistic and edge-case inputs.
- For CLI tools: run the tool with representative arguments and inspect output.
- For web APIs: start a dev server and probe endpoints with `curl`.
- For web UIs: use Playwright or a browser automation tool to verify the interface renders and behaves correctly.
- Write demo scripts in `/tmp` to avoid accidentally committing throwaway test files.

If manual testing uncovers an issue, fix it using red/green TDD so the case is permanently covered by automated tests.

---

## 7. Goal-Driven Execution

Transform imperative tasks into verifiable goals. Don't tell the agent what to do — define success criteria.

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan before coding:

```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria enable autonomous looping until the goal is met. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification and produce unreliable results.

---

## 8. Git Discipline

### Commit Hygiene
- Make small, atomic commits with clear messages describing WHAT changed and WHY.
- Each commit should leave the codebase in a working state with all tests passing.
- Do not bundle unrelated changes in a single commit.

### Branch Workflow
- Work on feature branches, not directly on `main`.
- Keep PRs small enough to review efficiently. Multiple small PRs beat one large one.
- Before opening a PR, run the full test suite and confirm it passes.

### PR Quality
- Every PR must include evidence that the code works: test results, manual testing notes, screenshots, or curl output.
- Review your own generated code before submitting it for others to review. Never file a PR with unreviewed agent output.
- PR descriptions must be accurate. Verify any auto-generated PR descriptions; do not ship text you have not read.

---

## 9. Code Quality Standards

### Avoid Technical Debt Proactively
- Do not accept poor naming, duplicated logic, or inconsistent APIs as "good enough for now."
- If a refactoring is conceptually simple (rename, extract, inline, reorganize), do it now rather than deferring it.
- Clean up code smells as part of delivering the feature, not as separate "someday" tasks.

### Compound Engineering
After each completed task, reflect briefly:
- What worked well that should become a standard pattern?
- What went wrong that a rule could prevent next time?
- Update these rules or project-specific guidelines accordingly.

### Exploratory Prototyping
When facing a non-obvious technology choice, build a small throwaway prototype to validate feasibility before committing to the approach. This is cheap and prevents costly mistakes later.

## 10. Code Review Checklist (Self-Review Before Submission)

Before marking any task as complete, verify:

- [ ] All new code is covered by automated tests.
- [ ] Tests were written FIRST and confirmed to fail before implementation.
- [ ] The full test suite passes with no regressions.
- [ ] Manual testing has been performed for user-facing features.
- [ ] Only requested changes appear in the diff — no drive-by refactoring.
- [ ] No speculative abstractions, unused imports, or dead code was introduced.
- [ ] Code matches the existing project style and conventions.
- [ ] Git commits are atomic with descriptive messages.
- [ ] Any assumptions made are documented inline or in the response.

---

## 11. Anti-Patterns — Explicitly Forbidden

- **Hallucinating libraries or APIs.** If you are not certain a function, method, or package exists, look it up first. Do not invent plausible-sounding imports.
- **Drive-by refactoring.** Do not restructure, rename, or reformat code that is unrelated to the current task.
- **Gold-plating.** Do not add features, configuration options, or error handling that was not requested.
- **Skipping the RED phase.** Never write tests after the implementation. Never skip confirming that tests fail first.
- **Submitting untested code.** Code that has never been executed is not complete.
- **Silent assumption-making.** Never pick one interpretation of an ambiguous request without surfacing the ambiguity.
- **Touching comments or docstrings** in code you are not modifying, even if they are wrong. Mention issues separately.

---

## 12. Language and Framework Conventions

Adapt to whatever language the project uses. When in doubt:

### Python
- Use type hints on all function signatures.
- Follow PEP 8. Use `ruff` for formatting if configured.
- Use `pytest` for testing. Use fixtures over setUp/tearDown.
- Use `uv` for dependency management if a `pyproject.toml` exists.

### TypeScript / JavaScript
- Use strict TypeScript when `.tsconfig` has strict mode.
- Use the project's existing test framework (Jest, Vitest, Mocha).
- Prefer `const` over `let`. Never use `var`.
- Use async/await over raw Promises.

### General
- Functions should do one thing.
- Prefer composition over inheritance.
- Prefer explicit over implicit.
- Keep functions short (under 40 lines as a guideline).
- Name variables and functions descriptively — clarity over brevity.

---

## 13. Context Management

- At the start of a session, explore the codebase to understand its structure before making changes. Read tests, config files, and recent git log.
- For large tasks, break them into subtasks that can each be verified independently.
- Use subagents or separate tool calls for expensive exploration so the main context stays focused on implementation.
- When a task requires touching many files, verify each file's changes independently before moving to the next.

## Quick Reference Card

| Situation | Action |
|---|---|
| Ambiguous request | Ask a clarifying question — do NOT guess |
| New feature | Write failing tests FIRST, then implement |
| Bug fix | Write a test that reproduces the bug FIRST |
| Refactor | Run tests before AND after, change nothing else |
| Existing codebase | Run the test suite FIRST to learn the project |
| PR ready | Self-review diff, remove unrelated changes, verify tests pass |
| Technology choice uncertain | Build a throwaway prototype to validate |
| Noticed unrelated issue | Mention it in your response — do NOT fix it silently |
| Trivial one-liner | Use judgment — not every change needs full ceremony |
