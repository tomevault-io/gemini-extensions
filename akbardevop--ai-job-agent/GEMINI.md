# AI Job Application Agent - Claude Code Instructions

## Overview

This is a job application automation toolkit. It automates filling and submitting applications on LinkedIn Easy Apply, Greenhouse, Lever, Jobvite, and Ashby, plus email triage and Google Sheets tracking.

Two ways to drive it:

1. **Bundled skills (recommended)** — type `/job-coach`, `/job-apply`, `/job-evaluate`, `/job-cv`, `/job-track`, `/job-triage`, `/job-status`, `/job-outreach`, `/job-followup`, `/job-dashboard`, `/job-interview`, `/job-patterns`, or `/job-setup` in any Claude Code session. Each skill wraps the scripts below and renders results as a markdown table. Install once with `bash skills/install.sh`.
2. **Raw scripts** — call the Node.js / Python scripts in `scripts/` directly from your terminal (documented below).

## Bundled Skills

Installed by `bash skills/install.sh` (symlinks them into `~/.claude/skills/`). Each skill's prompt lives at `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` — read it to see exactly what the agent does.

| Skill | Wraps | Output |
|-------|-------|--------|
| `/job-coach` | the persona — intake, research, slate, dispatch | target-role slate + next-move suggestions; persists to `config/search-plan.md` |
| `/job-setup` | `wizard.sh` equivalent — but in chat | conversational onboarding, auto-reads user files, writes configs, registers skills |
| `/job-apply <url> [--submit]` | 5 ATS fillers (auto-routed by URL host) | result table: platform, outcome, exit code |
| `/job-track [sync]` | local CSV + `google-sheet-sync.py` | counts-by-status table + recent activity |
| `/job-triage [query]` | `outlook-triage.js` | classified-email counts + preview table, step-through extract/mark-read |
| `/job-status <updates.json>` | `tracker-status-update.py` | before/after diff, confirmation prompt, result summary |
| `/job-outreach <target>` | `send-cold-email.js` + Claude (the agent drafts) | research → draft preview → dry-run → send → log to `outreach-log.csv` |
| `/job-followup [send]` | `outreach-log.csv` + `send-cold-email.js` | urgency table (overdue/due/soon/waiting) + optional step-through send |
| `/job-dashboard [live]` | `job-dashboard.mjs` (zero deps) | ANSI tables: applications + outreach + follow-ups. Snapshot in chat or `npm run dashboard` for live TUI |
| `/job-evaluate <url>` | WebFetch + 7-block A-G rubric + `/job-cv` chain + tracker append | structured eval report at `reports/<date>-<company>-<role>.md` + tailored PDF + tracker row |
| `/job-cv <jd>` | `scripts/generate-tailored-cv.mjs` (Playwright Chromium → PDF) | Claude rewrites base CV (no invention) → ATS-friendly PDF at `output/cv-<company>-<date>.pdf` |
| `/job-interview <company>` | `application-tracker.csv` + WebSearch + WebFetch | company snapshot + 10-15 likely Qs + 5-8 STAR stories from real projects + 5 smart asks + 3 red flags |
| `/job-patterns` | `application-tracker.csv` + `outreach-log.csv` | rejection diagnostics (by ATS / time-to-rej / geography / role-type / day-of-week) + 3 actionable fixes |

**First-run flow (gstack-style):** open Claude Code anywhere and paste this one message:

> Install ai-job-agent: run `git clone --single-branch --depth 1 https://github.com/AkbarDevop/ai-job-agent ~/.claude/skills/ai-job-agent && cd ~/.claude/skills/ai-job-agent && bash skills/install.sh` then add an "ai-job-agent" section to my CLAUDE.md telling you to treat me like a career-coaching client — open-ended job-search talk → `/job-coach` (intake + research + slate), job URL alone → `/job-apply`, "evaluate this URL" → `/job-evaluate` (rubric + report + tailored CV), "tailor my CV" → `/job-cv`, "prep me for X interview" → `/job-interview`, "what's working / why am I getting rejected" → `/job-patterns`, reaching out to a person → `/job-outreach`, follow-ups → `/job-followup`, "how am I doing" → `/job-dashboard`, tracker → `/job-track`, status updates → `/job-status`, Outlook → `/job-triage`, first-time setup → `/job-setup`. Never answer job-search questions conversationally — always dispatch. Tell me when done, then run /job-setup and chain into /job-coach intake.

Claude clones into `~/.claude/skills/ai-job-agent/`, registers all 13 skills as symlinks under `~/.claude/skills/`, writes the coach-first routing block into CLAUDE.md, runs `/job-setup` (identity + resume + optional msmtp), and chains into `/job-coach intake` (target roles + companies + timeline → live market research → ranked slate of next moves). **After that, the user talks naturally** — "I want to apply to this url", "email the VP at X", "evaluate this posting", "tailor my CV for this JD", "prep me for my interview at Y", "what's working" → diagnostics, "how am I doing" — and Claude dispatches to the right skill. No `cd` required ever; skills work from any directory in any session. `bash wizard.sh` and `bash setup.sh` still exist for non-Claude-Code users.

Skills find this repo via `$AI_JOB_AGENT_ROOT` → `~/.claude/skills/ai-job-agent/REPO_PATH` → `~/ai-job-agent`. Set the env var or rerun `install.sh` from a non-default clone location.

## Unified mode — `npm run agent`

Daily driver. Opens Claude Code chat (top pane) + live TUI dashboard (bottom pane) in one terminal window via tmux. They auto-sync via fs.watch — anything Claude does in chat that touches `application-tracker.csv` or `outreach-log.csv` re-renders the dashboard within ~200ms.

Launcher: `bin/job-agent.sh`. If `tmux` isn't installed it offers to `brew install tmux` (macOS) or `apt install tmux` (Linux) with a one-key confirmation. On decline, falls back to opening two Terminal/iTerm tabs (macOS) or printing manual instructions (Linux).

## NPM scripts

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `npm run agent` | Unified mode — Claude Code + live TUI dashboard, split-pane via tmux |
| `npm run dashboard` | Interactive 5-tab TUI dashboard (Applications · Outreach · Follow-ups · Pipeline · Reports) |
| `npm run dashboard:snapshot` | One-shot ANSI snapshot to stdout (used by /job-dashboard skill) |
| `npm run mirror` | Generate `data/applications.md` + `data/outreach.md` from CSVs (markdown twin) |
| `npm run mirror:watch` | Same, but rerun on every CSV change via fs.watch |
| `npm run smoke` | Fresh-install smoke test in a sandboxed `$HOME` (CI-safe) |
| `npm run doctor` | Health check on the real environment (toolchain, configs, msmtp, gcloud, skill files) |
| `npm run linkedin` / `greenhouse` / `lever` / `jobvite` / `ashby` | Direct ATS form-fillers (legacy CLI surface, wrapped by /job-apply) |
| `npm run triage` / `send` | Outlook search + send via CDP (legacy CLI surface, wrapped by /job-triage) |

## Output locations (all gitignored)

| Path | Owner | Contents |
|------|-------|----------|
| `application-tracker.csv` | source of truth | every applied / evaluated / interview / offer / rejected row |
| `outreach-log.csv` | source of truth | every cold email sent + replies + follow-up cadence |
| `data/applications.md` | `npm run mirror` | markdown twin of `application-tracker.csv` |
| `data/outreach.md` | `npm run mirror` | markdown twin of `outreach-log.csv` |
| `reports/<date>-<co>-<role>.md` | `/job-evaluate` | per-JD rubric report (A-G blocks + sources + recommended move) |
| `output/cv-<co>-<date>.pdf` | `/job-cv` | tailored ATS-friendly PDF resume |
| `interview-prep/<date>-<co>-<role>.md` | `/job-interview` | STAR prep doc + smart Qs + red flags |
| `config/search-plan.md` | `/job-coach` | the live job-search plan (intake outputs, target tiers, log) |

## Configuration

All personal details are in the `config/` directory:

- `config/candidate-profile.md` -- Full candidate profile, application rules, session state, and agent handoff context. **Read this first in every session.**
- `config/answer-bank.md` -- Pre-written answers for common application questions.
- `config/linkedin-config.json` -- LinkedIn Easy Apply config with identity, resume path, and Chrome cookie path.
- `config/example-config.json` -- Reference example showing all available fields.

## Workflow

**Recommended (skill-driven):** `/job-coach` (intake + slate) → for each row: `/job-evaluate <url>` (deep-dive + rubric) → if fit ≥ 4.0, automatically chains into `/job-cv` (tailored PDF) and offers `/job-apply` → after applying, run `/job-followup` weekly → `/job-triage` to log replies → `/job-status` to flip rows → `/job-patterns` once a month for diagnostics → `/job-interview` whenever an interview shows up.

**Legacy (raw scripts):** Search → Apply → Track → Triage.

### 1. Search for jobs

Use `/job-search` or `python-jobspy` to find matching roles. Filter by:
- Role fit (match resume variants to role types)
- Work authorization eligibility
- Location preferences
- Recency (prefer jobs posted in the last 72 hours)

### 2. Apply to jobs

Choose the right script based on the ATS platform:

```bash
# LinkedIn Easy Apply
node scripts/linkedin-easy-apply.js <jobUrl> config/linkedin-config.json

# Lever
node scripts/lever-apply.js <jobUrl> <configPath>

# Greenhouse
node scripts/greenhouse-apply.js <jobUrl> <configPath>

# Jobvite
node scripts/jobvite-apply.js <jobUrl> <configPath>

# Ashby
node scripts/ashby-apply.js <jobUrl> <configPath>
```

For Lever, Greenhouse, Jobvite, and Ashby, you need to inspect the form first to build the config with the correct field IDs and values.

### 3. Track applications

After each successful submission:

1. Append a row to the local `application-tracker.csv`
2. Append an entry to the daily log `submitted-applications-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
3. Sync to Google Sheets: `python3 scripts/google-sheet-sync.py application-tracker.csv`

### 4. Triage emails

Use the Outlook scripts to search for confirmation and rejection emails:

```bash
# Search for job-related emails
node scripts/outlook-triage.js search "application confirmation"

# Read a specific email
node scripts/outlook-triage.js extract 0

# Mark as read after processing
node scripts/outlook-triage.js mark-read 0
```

### 5. Update statuses

When you receive rejections, interviews, or other updates:

```bash
python3 scripts/tracker-status-update.py updates.json
```

## Application Rules

1. **Truthfulness first**: Prefer truthful, submittable applications over aggressive volume.
2. **Work authorization**: Skip hard citizen/green-card gated roles unless the form provides a truthful path for the candidate's actual status.
3. **Resume selection**: Use the appropriate resume variant for each role type (see candidate-profile.md for the mapping).
4. **Captcha honesty**: If a form stalls behind CAPTCHA, log it as "blocked" -- never inflate submitted counts.
5. **Headless default**: Use headless browser by default. Only open visible windows when manual intervention (e.g., CAPTCHA solving) is required.
6. **Email triage**: Mark confirmation emails as read after logging. Leave interviews, assessments, and recruiter outreach unread.

## Recommended Companion Skills

The skills below are community-built and complement the 13 bundled skills above:

- `/job-search` -- Multi-board job search
- `/tailor-resume` -- Resume customization per posting
- `/apply` -- AI-assisted ATS form filling (different from bundled `/job-apply`, which wraps this repo's scripts directly)
- `/interview-prep-generator` -- STAR stories and practice questions
- `/resume-ats-optimizer` -- ATS keyword optimization
- `/salary-negotiation-prep` -- Market rate research

See `skills/README.md` for the full list and install commands.

## gstack

This repo pairs well with [gstack](https://github.com/garrytan/gstack) — a general-purpose Claude Code skill pack for shipping code. Install gstack once (`git clone --single-branch --depth 1 https://github.com/garrytan/gstack.git ~/.claude/skills/gstack && cd ~/.claude/skills/gstack && ./setup`) and these gstack skills become useful in this repo's workflow:

- **Web browsing:** use `/browse` for all web browsing. Never use `mcp__claude-in-chrome__*` tools. `/connect-chrome` + `/setup-browser-cookies` for authenticated pages (useful for LinkedIn / Outlook flows).
- **Shipping code:** `/ship` to sync main + run tests + push + open PR (this repo pushes direct to main by convention, but `/ship` still handles the rest). `/review` for pre-landing paranoid review. `/codex` for a second-opinion code review.
- **Testing:** `/qa` / `/qa-only` for systematic QA + fix loops. `/browse` for one-off dogfooding.
- **Debugging:** `/investigate` for root-cause debugging. `/careful` / `/freeze` / `/guard` / `/unfreeze` for safety during destructive ops on the trackers / config files.
- **Dev-experience:** `/devex-review` after shipping a new skill — it actually runs the install + first-skill-invocation and scores the onboarding. `/plan-devex-review` before adding new skills.
- **Post-ship:** `/document-release` to sync `README.md` / `CLAUDE.md` / `skills/README.md` after a skill lands. `/retro` for the weekly "what did we ship" log.

If gstack isn't installed, those skills are optional — this repo's 13 bundled skills (`/job-coach`, `/job-setup`, `/job-evaluate`, `/job-apply`, `/job-track`, `/job-triage`, `/job-status`, `/job-outreach`, `/job-followup`, `/job-dashboard`, `/job-cv`, `/job-interview`, `/job-patterns`) work standalone.
