> How to author a new RustStream broker crate (the Broker contract, capabilities, conformance)


- A broker is its own crate that depends on `ruststream` with `default-features = false` (broker
  clients never go into core). Pre-1.0 the broker crate's version tracks the core minor line
  (core 0.7.x -> broker 0.7.x); breaking broker changes ship as a patch within the line.
- The lifecycle is a ladder of consuming transitions, not a flag: `Broker::connect(self) ->
  Connected` and `ConnectedBroker::shutdown(self) -> Closed`. Each state is a distinct type, so
  subscribing before connect, publishing after shutdown, or a double shutdown do not compile for
  the owner of the handle. The broker itself carries no subscriber or publisher type, so one
  application can mix broker kinds.
- Construction stays synchronous and I/O-free: `new(addrs)` only records config, all network work
  happens in `connect`, and the connected form holds the live client directly - it never checks a
  "maybe connected" state. A shared cell that `connect` fills is a legal internal pattern for
  handles given out before connect, but it is not the contract.
- A task the broker starts on its own behalf (a delayed-redelivery timer, a reply dispatcher, a
  commit window) runs on the runtime `connect` ran on: keep `Handle::current()` from `connect` in
  the connected form and spawn through it, never `tokio::spawn` from a publish, settle or request
  path. `harness::lifecycle` and the `capabilities::*` suites call from a runtime that stops.
- What stays a runtime rule is aliasing: publishers handed out earlier and clones of a shareable
  broker must surface an error when used after shutdown, never a silent success against a dead
  connection. `shutdown` never blocks or panics; do all fallible teardown there.
- Implement `Subscribe` on the **connected** form for the by-name `#[subscriber("topic")]` form,
  and ship a `SubscriptionSource<Connected<B>>` descriptor for broker-specific options (even a
  parameter-less broker ships one). Give the descriptor a constructor and derive `Clone`; add
  `FromName` when a name alone is enough to build it.
- Every descriptor declares `type Copies`, one of three. `AddressedCopies`: this process publishes
  the copies a retry is made of and the descriptor knows where they go (a subject, a topic, a
  stream, a queue); implement `RedeliveryAddressed` beside `SubscriptionSource`, which is what
  makes the address a property of the type. `NamedCopies`: this process publishes them but the
  descriptor addresses none (a wildcard subject, an MQTT filter, a Pulsar pattern, a list of
  topics), and the mount site names one with `.out_retry(policy).to(name)` or with a naming
  transform. `BrokerMoves`:
  the server or the client library moves the delivery itself (a delivery limit with a dead-letter
  exchange, a Pub/Sub dead-letter policy, an SQS redrive policy), so `.out_retry(..)` is a compile
  error at every mount site of that descriptor. The first two pair a retry publisher from
  `DefaultPublish`, so either over a broker without it does not compile.
- `Subscribe` carries the same `type Copies` for the by-name form: `AddressedCopies` where a
  publish under a subscribe name reaches the subscription opened by it, and the name is then the
  address; `NamedCopies` where it is not (a Pub/Sub subscription, an MQTT filter).
  `harness::redelivery_address` holds an addressed descriptor, and the bare `Name` where
  `Subscribe::Copies` is `AddressedCopies`, to its answer; `retry::broker_moves` holds a
  `BrokerMoves` descriptor to the cap and dead-letter destination it declares; and
  `harness::lifecycle` covers the rest of the ladder.
- `declare_retry` hands the descriptor the registration's `max_attempts(..)` and `dead_letter(..)`
  before it subscribes. Apply them to your own topology where the broker has a mechanism for them,
  and only when both are declared; keep the default otherwise and the runtime applies them.
- Override `IncomingMessage::redelivery_count` where the transport counts its own deliveries
  (JetStream `num_delivered`, SQS `ApproximateReceiveCount`, Pub/Sub `delivery_attempt`), so a
  registration's cap counts the broker's redeliveries and not only the copies the runtime
  published. The first delivery answers 1. That count is then the only one a cap reads, the
  framework's header never mixed in; increment `RETRY_COUNT_HEADER` on a copy your crate
  republishes (a wait queue, a retry topic) only where the transport counts nothing.
- Publishers split into policy plus live form: ship a freely constructible policy type carrying the
  options, implement `PublishPolicy<Connected>` to pair it into the live publisher, and implement
  `DefaultPublish` on the connected form when the plain policy works as-is (so `b.include(def)`
  compiles with no `.out_reply(..)`). Make mode selection a policy type transition, not a runtime
  flag: only the transactional policy's live form implements `TransactionalPublisher`.
- Per-message settings (a QoS, a priority, an ordering key, an expiration) are `Publisher::Options`,
  a type you own with every field optional (`()` when you have none). The policy holds the defaults,
  `publish(msg, options)` resolves the call's fields over them, and `options` is `None` on every
  path with no call site - a reply, a deferred retry. `Transaction` names an `Options` of its own,
  because a transaction may honour a different set than the publisher it was opened from. A value
  you cannot honour is a publish error, never a silent fallback;
  `conformance::message_shape::publish_options` checks all three.
- `DescribeServer` reports a coordinate, not the configuration: the host and port clients connect
  to, never credentials - the generated document is published. A broker configured from a URL
  builds its `ServerSpec` with `ServerSpec::from_url` (several addresses: `host_from_url` each);
  trimming the scheme off the URL and passing the rest to `ServerSpec::new` keeps the userinfo, and
  that bug shipped in more than one broker crate.
- Protocol bindings ride the descriptor: `channel_bindings`, `operation_bindings` and
  `message_bindings` on `SubscriptionSource`, and `ServerSpec::bindings` for the server.
  Build each with `Binding::new(protocol, version, &body)`, which writes `bindingVersion` and
  checks the protocol against the specification's closed list, or with `Binding::extension("x-..")`
  where the specification has no binding for the transport. They are computed from the descriptor
  alone (the document is built before connect, so a live partition count or a queue ARN cannot
  appear) and never carry a credential; `conformance::harness::describes_without_credentials`
  checks that, and `conformance::message_shape` extends it to publish-policy bindings and to a
  server built from several addresses. All of it is gated on the core's `asyncapi` feature, which
  your crate forwards.
- Implement capability traits (`BatchSubscriber`, `TransactionalPublisher`, `OwnedTransactions`,
  `RequestReply`, `Partitioned`, `Seekable`/`Seeker`, `Positioned`, `DescribeServer`) only for what
  the broker natively supports - never emulate. `BatchSubscriber` is the exception worth stretching
  for: a transport that delivers one message at a time still offers it, assembled on the client
  with the core's `BufferedSubscriber`, whose `batches` honours the size the mount named. The size
  is the framework's word and not yours; the deadline that closes a partial batch is yours, so put
  it on your descriptor (`.max_wait(..)`) - the 10 ms default is sized for an in-process bus, and
  the shipping broker crates settle between 10 and 50 ms. Put the capability on
  `Subscribe::Subscriber` too, or a `&[T]` body on `#[subscriber("topic")]` fails to compile.
  Declining it is still right where batching breaks a guarantee the transport carries (a ZeroMQ
  `ROUTER` answers each peer at its own address, and a batch's replies share one context); say so
  in your crate's docs.
- Expose the per-delivery context as a `#[non_exhaustive]` typed struct plus `ContextField` key
  types (unit structs with an associated `Context` and owned `Value`), so handlers can take
  `Ctx<Partition>`-style parameters. No type-map, no heap on the delivery path. A position that is
  not `Copy` borrows on the read side (`Field::Value<'a>` is generic over the source's lifetime);
  only the `ContextField::Value` behind `Ctx<K>` has to be owned and `'static`, so that key clones.
- Your prelude has three layers in this order: `pub use ruststream::prelude::*;`, the crate surface
  a service names (the broker, its subscription source, its `Config`, its error, the `ContextField`
  keys a body reads), and your publish policies aliased to the uniform mount-site names
  (`NatsPublish as Publish`, `KafkaTransactionalPublish as TransactionalPublish`,
  `LapinRequest as Request`), with the consumer-side capability traits you implement added next to
  them as a manifest. A handler body imports only the core prelude and bounds a slot with the
  broker capability trait (`Out<impl Publisher>`, `Out<impl TransactionalPublisher>`,
  `Out<impl OwnedTransactions>`, `Out<impl RequestReply>`); a routes file imports yours. The one
  exception is a body adjusting a per-message setting: it imports your prelude for the step and
  names your options type in the bound, and its signature then says which broker it is tied to.
  The core exports no trait under the policy names, so the aliases collide with nothing - but your
  prelude must never shadow a core name with anything of yours, because an explicit re-export beats
  the core glob silently and the error lands in the service's file. Leave out a trait whose method
  collides with a defaulted core one (`Partitioned::partition_key` against
  `IncomingMessage::partition_key`), and leave `BatchSubscriber` out of the manifest entirely: the
  framework calls it and no body ever writes it as a bound. Pin both halves behind your own glob:
  `fn _p<T: Publisher>() {}` and `let _: Publish = Publish::default();`.
- `ack` consumes `self`; for transports without acks return `AckError::Unsupported`, at every
  settling site. That answer is what lets the runtime tell a transport that honoured a delay from
  one that cannot hold a message back, and the conformance suite passes on it. A handle that
  carries a constant for a run of messages (a tenant, a producer name, a schema id) returns it from
  `base_headers` rather than writing it inside `publish`; the builder writes the call site's
  headers over that base key by key. A delivery setting is not one of those - it belongs to the
  message, as a field of `Options`. Errors and logs are self-explanatory: name the subscription and
  the type involved, not just the raw error.
- Ship a `cargo generate` template per transport or topology (`templates/nats`, `templates/nats-js`)
  and render plus `cargo check` it in your own CI, so an API change breaks your build rather than a
  user's first one. Template blocks are additive only, and the package manifest is
  `Cargo.toml.liquid`: cargo parses every `Cargo.toml` in a git source and a placeholder in the
  package name breaks every dependent.
- Integrations that need async I/O around encode/decode (schema registries, wire-format envelopes)
  are middleware on the async edges: transcode on the subscription's delivery path for consuming,
  and a core `PublishLayer` (`RustStream::publish_layer`) for publishing. Never a custom sync
  `Codec` and never hooks threaded through the publisher - handlers stay on the default codec.
- Raw librdkafka-style client options go through a passthrough builder (`config(key, value)`), not
  one wrapper method per option. Auth (TLS, SASL) rides that passthrough; surface only the cargo
  features that build hermetically everywhere, and let users enable exotic client features by
  depending on the client crate directly (cargo features are additive).
- Testing: the in-process mode is part of the broker contract. Under a `testing` feature implement
  `InProcess` on the production broker (`connect_in_process(self)`: the consuming transition to the
  broker's own connected form over an in-process transport, no I/O), `TestableBroker` on that
  connected form, and register the production type with `register_testable_broker!(YourBroker)`,
  so `TestApp::start` runs a service's production app in process and a test addresses the broker
  as `tb.broker::<YourBroker>()`. The connected form, subscriber, publishers and delivery type each
  gain an in-process variant that exists only under the feature (without it: one variant, no
  branch); the transport has no configuration of its own and reads every setting from the
  production broker. It never succeeds where the real broker fails: a publish, ack, requeue or
  subscription the server rejects or strands is rejected in process the same way, and it keeps
  what the server keeps: a queue or a log returns `Backlog::Delivered` from
  `TestableBroker::backlog` and delivers what was published before a subscription opened
  (publish/subscribe keeps the default `Backlog::Missed`). Run the contract
  suites in process as well as against a real server (`run_suite` connects in process; wrap the
  broker in `harness::InProcessBroker` for `lifecycle` and the capability suites), and run
  `lifecycle` because it asks whether a publisher made before the shutdown errors afterwards. Acks
  are answered the way the real transport answers them, including `AckError::Unsupported`.
  Reproduce what the client does (competing consumers, group distribution, correlation, buffering
  until commit); broker-side semantics (fencing, cluster atomicity, broker-held timeouts) are
  tested live with `TestApp::start_live`, and every gap gets a comment naming the assertion it
  makes unsound plus a test pinning it.

## The lifecycle ladder

`new` is synchronous; `connect` consumes the broker and yields a distinct connected type.

```rust
use ruststream::{Broker, ConnectedBroker};

pub struct MyBroker {
    addrs: String,
}

impl MyBroker {
    /// Records the address; opens the connection later in `Broker::connect`.
    #[must_use]
    pub fn new(addrs: impl Into<String>) -> Self {
        Self { addrs: addrs.into() }
    }
}

/// The connected form owns the live client - no "maybe connected" check anywhere.
pub struct ConnectedMyBroker {
    client: Client,
}

impl Broker for MyBroker {
    type Error = MyError;
    type Connected = ConnectedMyBroker;

    async fn connect(self) -> Result<ConnectedMyBroker, MyError> {
        let client = Client::connect(&self.addrs).await.map_err(MyError::connect)?;
        Ok(ConnectedMyBroker { client })
    }
}

impl ConnectedBroker for ConnectedMyBroker {
    type Error = MyError;
    type Closed = ();

    async fn shutdown(self) -> Result<(), MyError> {
        self.client.drain().await.map_err(MyError::shutdown)
    }
}
```

## Publisher: policy plus live form

The policy is pure declaration and constructible anywhere; `pair` turns it into the live handle
once, at startup.

```rust
use ruststream::{DefaultPublish, OutgoingMessage, PairError, PublishPolicy, Publisher};

/// The broker's per-message settings: every field optional, so a call carries only what it
/// adjusted. Derive `Debug` and `PartialEq` too, and a test asserts `with_options(&MyOptions { .. })`.
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, Default, PartialEq, Eq)]
pub struct MyOptions {
    priority: Option<u8>,
}

/// The publish policy: builder options only, no connection, no publish surface. This is where the
/// per-message defaults are configured, at the mount site.
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Default)]
pub struct MyPublish {
    exchange: Option<String>,
    priority: u8,
}

impl PublishPolicy<ConnectedMyBroker> for MyPublish {
    type Live = MyPublisher;

    async fn pair(self, connected: &ConnectedMyBroker) -> Result<MyPublisher, PairError> {
        Ok(MyPublisher {
            client: connected.client.clone(),
            exchange: self.exchange,
            default_priority: self.priority,
        })
    }
}

/// The plain policy works with its defaults, so the runtime can build a default reply publisher.
impl DefaultPublish for ConnectedMyBroker {
    type Policy = MyPublish;
}

impl Publisher for MyPublisher {
    /// The client writes the bytes into a frame of its own and keeps nothing, so this publisher
    /// is lent them; a client that keeps the payload declares `Take` and is handed a `BytesMut`.
    type Payload = Lend;
    type Error = MyError;
    type Options = MyOptions;

    /// Resolving the call's fields over the policy's is the first thing publish does.
    async fn publish(
        &self,
        msg: OutgoingMessage<'_, &[u8]>,
        options: Option<&MyOptions>,
    ) -> Result<(), MyError> {
        let priority = options
            .and_then(|options| options.priority)
            .unwrap_or(self.default_priority);
        self.client
            .send(msg.name(), msg.payload(), priority)
            .await
            .map_err(MyError::publish)
    }
}
```

`Publisher::Payload` is the declaration everything else follows. Declare `Take` when your client
keeps the payload past the call and you are handed the `BytesMut` the framework wrote
(`Vec::from` is free, `freeze()` costs one block); declare `Lend` when your transport only reads
the bytes, and inside a dispatch loop the framework lends you one buffer per loop, so a reply
through your broker allocates nothing per delivery.

Read the payload with `msg.payload()` and the headers with `msg.headers()` whichever form you
declared. A transport that consumes the message takes its parts with `msg.into_parts()` - the
destination, the payload and the header map in one move, nothing copied.

## Per-message settings on the publish builder

A call site adjusts one field through a step you add to the publish builder. Nothing wraps the
publisher, so the publish still goes through the mount site's own entry, with the codec and the
transforms that entry named. The bound on the sink's options type is what keeps your steps off a
builder over another broker's publisher. Ship the trait from your prelude, next to the policy
aliases.

```rust
use ruststream::runtime::{PublishBuilder, PublishSink};

pub trait MyPublishSteps {
    /// Sends this one message at `priority`, whatever the mount site's default is.
    #[must_use]
    fn priority(self, priority: u8) -> Self;
}

impl<Sink, Body, Enc, Hdrs, Dest> MyPublishSteps for PublishBuilder<Sink, Body, Enc, Hdrs, Dest>
where
    Sink: PublishSink<Options = MyOptions>,
{
    fn priority(mut self, priority: u8) -> Self {
        self.options_mut()
            .get_or_insert_with(MyOptions::default)
            .priority = Some(priority);
        self
    }
}
```

A step is the only shape a per-message setting takes. Do not put the send in a trait of your own: a
publish that leaves through a value of yours is one the test harness no longer attributes to the
slot, and a setting like an ordering key is exactly what a test wants to assert on. Do not carry
one as a header either - it is a protocol field, not bytes your `publish` parses back inside one
process.

## Subscription source

`Subscribe` on the connected form covers `#[subscriber("topic")]`; a descriptor carries richer
options and resolves against the connected form at startup.

```rust
use ruststream::{FromName, RedeliveryAddress, Subscribe, SubscriptionSource};

impl Subscribe for ConnectedMyBroker {
    type Subscriber = MySubscriber;
    async fn subscribe(&self, name: &str) -> Result<MySubscriber, MyError> {
        self.open(MySubscribeOptions::new(name)).await
    }

    /// Where a publisher reaches this subscription again. Defaulted to `None`; answer with the
    /// name itself wherever a publish under a subscribe name lands in that subscription.
    fn redelivery_address(&self, name: &str) -> Option<RedeliveryAddress> {
        Some(RedeliveryAddress::new(name.to_owned()))
    }
}

impl SubscriptionSource<ConnectedMyBroker> for MySubscribeOptions {
    type Subscriber = MySubscriber;
    /// This process publishes the copies a retry of this subscription is made of, and this
    /// descriptor knows where they go.
    type Copies = AddressedCopies;

    fn name(&self) -> &str {
        &self.subject
    }
    async fn subscribe(self, connected: &ConnectedMyBroker) -> Result<MySubscriber, MyError> {
        connected.open(self).await
    }

    /// The same answer for the descriptor, asking the broker where only the live connection
    /// knows (a Pub/Sub subscription's topic). The runtime asks once, at startup.
    async fn redelivery_address(
        &self,
        _connected: &ConnectedMyBroker,
    ) -> Result<Option<RedeliveryAddress>, MyError> {
        Ok(Some(RedeliveryAddress::new(self.subject.clone())))
    }
}

/// A kind identified by a name and nothing else; makes `#[subscriber(MySubscribeOptions)]` legal.
impl FromName for MySubscribeOptions {
    fn from_name(name: impl Into<Cow<'static, str>>) -> Self {
        Self::new(name)
    }
}
```

Users then write the descriptor straight into the attribute, builder chain and all:
`#[subscriber(MySubscribeOptions::new("orders.*").durable("worker"))]`.

## Settings in your own vocabulary

Core exposes one hook - `map_source`, a transform over the source the mount site is building - and
your crate layers its own extension trait on top, bound to your source type, so the methods do not
exist on a builder for another broker.

```rust
pub trait MySubscriber {
    fn durable(self, name: impl Into<String>) -> Self;
}

// The four state slots are (workers, failure policies, start position, batch size); `Codec` is
// the registration's own decode override, `()` until one is named.
impl<Def: Declared, W, F, P, Pg, Codec> MySubscriber
    for SubscriberBuilder<Def, MySubscribeOptions, (W, F, P, Pg), Codec>
{
    fn durable(self, name: impl Into<String>) -> Self {
        self.map_source(|source| source.durable(name))
    }
}
```

One core setting changes the source type rather than a state slot: `start_at(..)` wraps your
descriptor in `StartAt<MySubscribeOptions, Position>`, and your methods fall out of scope on every
subscription that named a start position. Cover it with a second impl over the wrapped source,
where the position slot reads `Fixed` by construction, so the two never overlap;
`StartAt::map_inner` takes the descriptor out and hands the position back untouched, so each method
stays one line.

The publish side mirrors it. A mount site names a publish policy with `.out(marker, policy)` -
`Reply` for what a `reply("dest")` handler returns, an `Out` slot's marker for a slot - and
`MapPublisher` is the hook over the policy that position carries. Bind the extension trait to the
policy, not to the chain, so one impl covers the reply, every slot, a router and a broker scope:

```rust
pub trait MyPublishSettings {
    fn ack_timeout(self, timeout: Duration) -> Self;
}

impl<T: MapPublisher<Policy = MyPublish>> MyPublishSettings for T {
    fn ack_timeout(self, timeout: Duration) -> Self {
        self.map_publisher(|policy| policy.ack_timeout(timeout))
    }
}
```

A policy setting is a property of the handle, never the destination: where a message goes is the
message type's declaration or the call site's `.to(..)`, so a policy method that names a subject, a
topic or a stream puts a second source of truth next to the one the document reports.

`map_publisher` replaces the policy with one of the same type, which is what a publisher's own
settings produce; a different policy type is a different publish mode and belongs in the
`.out(marker, policy)` call itself, where an already-configured value can be passed directly
(`.out_reply(Publish::default().ack_timeout(Duration::from_secs(5)))`).

## Extending the `Out` slot vocabulary

A body's `Out<impl X, Marker>` accepts any `X` the live value behind the slot implements, so a live
value that is more than a publisher (a per-partition producer cache, a shard router) carries a
capability trait of your own. What the body holds is not that value but the arena entry,
`Slot<M, W, E, Pipe, Body>`, a transparent window onto it: autoderef carries a method call through,
a trait bound does not. Graft one blanket impl next to your trait and helpers generic over the
capability take the entry as it is:

```rust
impl<M, W: Lanes, E, Pipe, Body> Lanes for Slot<M, W, E, Pipe, Body> {
    fn lane(&self, shard: u64) -> (&MyPublisher, &'static str) {
        (**self).lane(shard)
    }
}
```

A capability that hands out a publisher and lets the body send through it publishes outside the
slot view, so the harness attributes nothing to the slot and a test asserts on the broker's publish
log instead. That is the price of handing out the inner publisher. A capability that only sets one
per-message setting and ends in a single publish is not a capability trait at all - it is a field
of `Publisher::Options` and a step on the builder.

## Typed context and `Ctx` keys

The broker names its context type on the subscriber; `ContextField` keys make individual fields
injectable as handler parameters.

```rust
use ruststream::ContextField;

/// Per-delivery context of this broker.
#[non_exhaustive]
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub struct MyContext {
    pub partition: i32,
}

/// `Ctx<Partition>` in a handler binds the delivery's partition.
#[derive(Debug, Default, Clone, Copy)]
pub struct Partition;

impl ContextField for Partition {
    type Context = MyContext;
    type Value = i32;
    fn read(self, src: &MyContext) -> i32 {
        src.partition
    }
}
```

Batch subscriptions take a second, separate struct: what the whole *subscription* shares (a seek
handle, a stream name), with `BuildBatchContext` on it - the runtime builds one per batch from the
batch's first delivery - plus `Field` keys a batch body reads with `ctx.context(..)`. Per-delivery
fields stay off it (a batch spans many deliveries, so a position rides the elements instead), and
keeping the two structs apart is what enforces that: a per-delivery context does not implement
`BuildBatchContext`, so a batch body cannot name it. Nothing subscription-scoped to offer means no
impl at all - `()` is the default.

## Conformance

The suites are written against the traits, so they run unchanged in process (the broker's
`InProcess` transition, whose connected form is the `TestableBroker`) and against a real server
behind an env gate. Run both: the in-process mode is what a service's whole test suite rides on,
and the server is what the release runs against. `run_suite` covers the routing contract - ordering, ack and nack, headers,
the publish log, the `routes` answer and the harness counts; the `capabilities::*` suites are yours
to call, one per capability you implement, and they are not part of `run_suite`.
`settlement::matches_in_process` holds ack, nack, out-of-order settlement and an unsettled drop to
their meaning live and in process, and fails when the two answer differently; `lifecycle` holds a
`nack_after` delay as a floor. `conformance::in_process::{backlog_matches_server,
refuses_like_the_server}` hold the in-process transport's backlog declaration and its refusals to
the real server; run them with the live suites.

```rust
use ruststream::conformance::harness;

// sync Fn() -> B, where B: InProcess and B::Connected: Subscribe; the production broker, connected
// through connect_in_process
#[tokio::test(flavor = "multi_thread", worker_threads = 2)]
async fn routing_conformance() {
    harness::run_suite(|| MyBroker::new("my://localhost")).await;
}

// the ladder: sync new -> connect(self) -> subscribe via SubscriptionSource -> publish ->
// receive -> ack (accepting AckError::Unsupported) -> shutdown(self), then a publisher made
// before shutdown must error after it, and a publish to the address the subscription reported
// must arrive at that subscription
#[tokio::test(flavor = "multi_thread", worker_threads = 2)]
async fn lifecycle_conformance() {
    let Ok(url) = std::env::var("MY_BROKER_TEST_URL") else { return };
    // the closures stay closures: their bounds are higher-ranked, so a bare method path
    // would bind one concrete lifetime and fail to type-check
    harness::lifecycle(
        || MyBroker::new(url.clone()),
        |name| MySubscribeOptions::new(name),
        |connected| connected.publisher(),
    )
    .await;
}
```

When changing anything on the broker contract, run the conformance suite against the real broker
before releasing - an in-process pass is not enough. Every broker repo has a `just test-brokers`
recipe that starts its docker-compose stand and runs the live suites.
