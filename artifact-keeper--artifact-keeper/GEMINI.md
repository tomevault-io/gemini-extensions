```

## Code Style

Rust 1.75+: Follow standard conventions

## Git & GitHub

### Branch Protection — NEVER push directly to main

All changes must go through pull requests:

1. **Create a feature branch** from main:
   ```bash
   git checkout main && git pull
   git checkout -b feat/short-description   # or fix/, chore/, docs/
   ```

2. **Make changes and commit** to the feature branch

3. **Push and create PR**:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin feat/short-description
   gh pr create --fill   # or with --title and --body
   ```

4. **Merge via GitHub** after CI passes (squash merge preferred)

Branch naming conventions:
- `feat/` — new features
- `fix/` — bug fixes
- `chore/` — maintenance, dependencies, CI
- `docs/` — documentation only

### Parallel Agent Work (shallow clones)

When dispatching multiple agents to work on separate features or fixes in parallel, use **shallow clones in `/tmp/`** instead of git worktrees. Worktrees share the `.git` directory and agents end up switching branches in the main worktree, corrupting each other's state.

**Pattern for each agent:**
```bash
WORK_DIR="/tmp/$(uuidgen)-artifact-keeper"
git clone --depth 50 --branch main git@github.com:artifact-keeper/artifact-keeper.git "$WORK_DIR"
cd "$WORK_DIR"
git checkout -b feat/issue-description
# ... make changes, run checks, commit, push, create PR ...
rm -rf "$WORK_DIR"
```

Each agent gets a fully isolated repo copy. No shared state, no branch conflicts, no rust-analyzer cross-contamination. The agent must do ALL work inside `$WORK_DIR` and never touch the primary working directory at `/Users/khan/ak/artifact-keeper`.

### Pre-push Quality Checklist

Every commit must pass these checks locally before pushing. Do NOT use "push and see if CI passes" as a strategy.

```bash
cargo fmt --check                                          # formatting
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings      # linting
cargo test --workspace --lib                               # unit tests
```

Additionally, before pushing:
- Check for code duplication: if structurally similar blocks appear 3+ times in new code, refactor into a shared helper
- Check test coverage: new pure functions should have at least one test, aim for 70%+ of new lines covered
- Check migration numbering: verify the migration number is not already taken (`ls backend/migrations/ | tail -5`)

### Maintenance Branches

Long-lived `release/X.Y.x` branches exist for shipping bug fixes to older release series:

- **`release/1.0.x`** — maintenance branch for the 1.0 series (created from `v1.0.0-rc.5`)
- **`release/1.1.x`** — maintenance branch for the 1.1 series (created from `v1.1.2`)
- **`main`** — continues with 1.2.x (and beyond) development

**Bug fix workflow for maintenance branches:**
1. Create a fix branch from the maintenance branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout release/1.1.x && git pull
   git checkout -b fix/short-description
   ```
2. Push and create a PR **targeting `release/1.1.x`** (not main):
   ```bash
   git push -u origin fix/short-description
   gh pr create --base release/1.1.x --fill
   ```
3. Tag releases from the maintenance branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout release/1.1.x && git pull
   git tag v1.1.3 && git push origin v1.1.3
   ```
4. Cherry-pick fixes between maintenance and `main` so both lines stay in sync. Bug fixes typically land on the maintenance branch first, then cherry-pick forward to main.

**Docker image tags** (set by `docker/metadata-action` in `docker-publish.yml`):
- Version tags **strip the `v` prefix**: git tag `v1.1.0-rc.2` → Docker tag `:1.1.0-rc.2`
- `:latest` is only set for stable releases (no `-rc`, `-beta`, etc.)
- `:1.0`, `:1.1` series tags are set automatically via semver parsing
- `:dev` is only set for `main` branch pushes
- `:sha-<commit>` is set for every build

### Releases

- Release notes are **auto-generated by GitHub** (`generate_release_notes: true` in `release.yml`). They show the actual changelog (PRs merged, commits) since the previous tag.
- **Do NOT hardcode static release notes** in the workflow. No product descriptions, feature lists, or format counts in release bodies.
- The release workflow is at `.github/workflows/release.yml`, triggered by `v*` tags.
- The release-gate (artifact-keeper-test) must pass for a release to be published. If gates fail, the release is created as a **draft** with binaries attached but not published.

### Changelog and Release Notes

Every CHANGELOG entry and GitHub Release must include recognition sections. This is required for every release, no exceptions.

**Process when writing a changelog entry or release notes:**
1. Look at all PRs/commits since the last tag
2. For each fix, check the linked issue(s) to find who reported it
3. Check `gh pr list --state merged` for external PR authors (not `brandonrc` or bots)
4. Check the Sponsors section in README.md for current backers
5. Add a `### Thank You` section crediting external contributors who filed issues, reported bugs, or submitted PRs
6. Add a `### Sponsors` section thanking current backers by name and GitHub handle
7. **Do NOT include maintainer `brandonrc`** in the thank you section, only external contributors
8. If no external contributors reported issues for this release, omit the Thank You section
9. The Sponsors section is always included if there are active sponsors

**Example format in CHANGELOG.md:**
```markdown
## [1.x.x] - YYYY-MM-DD

### Sponsors

Thank you to our backers for supporting ongoing development:
- **Ash A.** ([@dragonpaw](https://github.com/dragonpaw))
- **Gabriel Rodriguez** ([@injectedfusion](https://github.com/injectedfusion))

[Become a sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/artifact-keeper)

### Thank You
- @username for reporting the OCI auth issue behind reverse proxies (#123)
- @another-user for identifying the Maven SNAPSHOT re-upload bug (#456)
- @contributor for the SSO admin fix PR (#609)

### Added
...
```

**GitHub Release notes** follow the same structure. The release workflow auto-generates a changelog from merged PRs, but the Sponsors and Thank You sections must be prepended manually (or by the release script) before publishing.

### Other Git Rules

- **Do NOT add AI Co-Authored-By lines** (e.g., Claude, GPT) to commit messages — real human co-authors are fine
- **Do NOT include "Generated with Claude" or similar AI attribution** in PR descriptions
- **Always use `gh` CLI** for GitHub operations (PRs, issues, workflows, etc.)
  - Use `gh pr create` for pull requests
  - Use `gh issue` for issues
  - Use `gh workflow` for workflow operations
  - Do not use raw git commands for GitHub-specific features
- **Always use the PR template** when creating PRs with `gh pr create`. The template is at `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`. Since `gh` does not auto-fill it, read the template and structure the `--body` to match its sections (Summary, Test Checklist, API Changes). Fill in checkboxes based on actual work done.

## Infrastructure & Cost Rules

- **NEVER build Docker images or compile code on EC2/cloud instances.** Cloud compute costs money. All builds must happen locally on the developer's MacBook or via GitHub Actions CI.
- **Demo EC2 instance** (`i-0caaf8acac6f85d4d`, Elastic IP `3.222.57.187`): Only pull pre-built images from `ghcr.io`, never `docker compose build`.
- **SSH access**: `ssh ubuntu@3.222.57.187` (uses local SSH key)
- **Demo stack**: Managed via systemd service `artifact-keeper-demo` and Caddy reverse proxy for TLS. Compose file at `/opt/artifact-keeper/deploy/demo/docker-compose.demo.yml`.
- **Demo version pinning**: Set `ARTIFACT_KEEPER_VERSION` in `/opt/artifact-keeper/deploy/demo/.env` to pin a release (e.g., `ARTIFACT_KEEPER_VERSION=1.1.0-rc.2`). Omit the `v` prefix — Docker tags use semver without `v`. Default is `latest` if unset.
- **Demo update procedure**: `ssh ubuntu@3.222.57.187`, edit `.env` with the desired version, then `cd /opt/artifact-keeper/deploy/demo && docker compose -f docker-compose.demo.yml pull && docker compose -f docker-compose.demo.yml up -d`.
- **Docker images** are published to `ghcr.io/artifact-keeper/artifact-keeper-{backend,web,openscap}` by the Docker Publish CI workflow on every push to main and on release tags.
- **GitHub Pages site** (`/site/` directory): Combined landing page + Starlight docs, deployed to `artifactkeeper.com`.
