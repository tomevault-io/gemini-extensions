# MCS Automation — Core Rules

> **RULE ZERO — HARD STOP: Fire GPT-5.4 on every interaction. No exceptions.**
>
> Every user message triggers GPT co-generation via `node tools/multi-model-review.js`. This is enforced by hooks:
> - **UserPromptSubmit hook** injects a reminder on every prompt
> - **Stop hook** checks for attestation and blocks if GPT was not called
> - **Attestation file** written by `multi-model-review.js` on every successful (or attempted) call
>
> Pick the right command: `challenge` (before implementing), `ask` (design/questions), `review-code` (after code), `diagnose` (debugging), `generate-*` (MCS content). If GPT is unavailable (exit code 3), proceed alone — that counts as attempted. Full protocol: `.claude/rules/gpt-co-generation.md`

Automate Microsoft Copilot Studio (MCS) agent creation using a hybrid build stack: PAC CLI for listing agents, MCS LSP Wrapper for component sync, Island Gateway API for model catalog and eval upload, Dataverse API for agent creation and publishing, Direct Line API for testing, and user-guided manual steps for new OAuth connections.

Research Microsoft-first (MCS built-in > Power Platform > Azure > M365 connectors) because enterprise agents run best on the native stack. The **brief.json** is the single source of truth — everything flows from it.

## Workflow

```
INIT → CONTEXT → RESEARCH → [SOLUTION TYPE GATE] → BUILD (includes guard) → EVALUATE → [FIX] → [REPORT]
```

| Skill | Purpose | Dashboard |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| `/mcs-init` | Create project folder structure | — |
| `/mcs-context` | Pull M365 history via WorkIQ | — |
| `/mcs-research` | Read docs, identify agents, research components, enrich brief.json + generate evals | Research |
| `/mcs-build` | Pre-build validation (guard) + build agent(s) in MCS via hybrid stack | Build |
| `/mcs-eval` | Run eval tests, write results to brief.json | Evaluate |
| `/mcs-fix` | Analyze eval failures, apply fixes, re-evaluate | Fix Failures |
| `/mcs-refresh` | Refresh knowledge cache files | — |
| `/mcs-report` | Generate reports (brief/build/customer/deployment) | — |
| `/feedback` | File bug reports or feature suggestions via GitHub CLI | Sidebar |

Each skill has detailed instructions in its own `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md`.

## Installed Plugins (Auto-Routing Rules)

8 plugins installed from `claude-plugins-official`. MCS skills remain primary — plugins handle tooling, code quality, and developer experience.

**Auto-firing (no manual invocation needed):**

| Plugin | Triggers When | What It Does |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| `context7` | Claude needs non-Microsoft library docs (React, Vite, Zustand, etc.) | MCP server provides up-to-date library documentation. Complements `microsoft-learn` MCP. |
| `typescript-lsp` | Any `.ts`/`.tsx`/`.js`/`.jsx` file is edited | Background LSP for type checking, go-to-definition, error detection. |
| `frontend-design` | Frontend/UI work requested ("build a component", "redesign the dashboard") | Distinctive, production-grade UI generation with bold aesthetics. |
| `skill-creator` | User asks to create, improve, or eval a skill | Skill authoring framework with built-in eval benchmarking. |
| `claude-md-management` | User mentions CLAUDE.md quality, audit, or maintenance | Audits CLAUDE.md against codebase state, scores quality. |

**Routed by Claude (invoke automatically at these moments):**

| Plugin | When to Auto-Invoke | Slash Command |
|--------|-------------------|---------------|
| `code-review` | After creating a PR via `/commit-push-pr` or `gh pr create` — run automatically on the PR | `/code-review` |
| `commit-commands` | When user says "commit", "push", "create PR", or after completing a coding task and user approves | `/commit`, `/commit-push-pr` |
| `session-report` | When user asks about token usage, costs, or session efficiency; or at end of long sessions | `/session-report` |
| `claude-md-management` | At end of sessions that revealed missing CLAUDE.md context or after significant codebase changes | `/revise-claude-md` |

**Routing priority:** MCS skills (`/mcs-*`) always take precedence over plugins. Plugins handle code-level work; MCS skills handle platform-level work.

## Dual Model Co-Generation (Hook-Enforced)

Fire GPT-5.4 on **every interaction** — not just "non-trivial" tasks, **everything**. Enforced by three layers:
1. **UserPromptSubmit hook** (`.claude/hooks/gpt-reminder.js`) — injects reminder on every prompt
2. **Stop hook** (`.claude/hooks/check-gpt-attestation.js`) — blocks response if no attestation found
3. **Attestation** — `multi-model-review.js` writes `$TMPDIR/claude-gpt-attestations/<session>.json` on every call

Skip only when GPT is unavailable (exit code 3) — the tool writes an "unavailable" attestation, satisfying the hook. Full protocol, commands, merge rules, and value patterns in `.claude/rules/gpt-co-generation.md`.

---

## Core Philosophy

1. **Brief-driven build** — brief.json drives every build because a single source of truth prevents drift between design and execution. Fill gaps before building.

2. **Eval reference templates** — three eval sets (boundaries 100%, quality 85%, edge-cases 80%) generated as starter templates for users to review, edit, and finalize. Upload as reference — don't auto-iterate or auto-run.

3. **Multi-agent when justified** — score objectively using 6 factors (3+ = multi-agent) because premature decomposition adds complexity without quality gain.

4. **Microsoft-first research** — resolve Priority 1-4 components from cache because they are well-documented and enterprise-supported. Only escalate to live research for Priority 5-6 external systems.

5. **Assess before building** — run the solution type scoring after identifying agents because a Power Automate flow that works is better than an agent that is just a thin API wrapper.

6. **All-API build stack** — zero browser automation because deterministic API calls are reproducible and verifiable. User-guided manual steps only for new OAuth connections.

7. **Assume max licensing** — always assume the customer has the best license available: M365 Copilot, Copilot Studio, Frontier program, premium connectors, Dynamics 365. Never ask licensing questions during research or preview. Auto-fill all `business.licensing` fields to `"yes"`. Only override if the customer explicitly states a limitation.

## Error Handling

When something fails, stop and research broadly before retrying:

1. Search for the error message + "Copilot Studio" via WebSearch
2. Check MS Learn MCP for official troubleshooting
3. Read back API state to verify what actually happened
4. Log significant findings to `knowledge/learnings/`
5. Retry with the researched approach — never the same failed approach twice
6. After 2 failed approaches, escalate to the user

## Key Principles

1. **Brief is the blueprint** — brief.json drives the build
2. **Evals drive quality** — boundaries gate then quality then edge-cases before publish
3. **MVP first** — build what is possible now, plan what is blocked
4. **Build specialists first** — children before orchestrator in multi-agent
5. **Verify environment** — confirm account + environment target before operations
6. **Research errors** — stop, research broadly, then retry with a new approach
7. **Capture learnings** — every build makes the next build smarter
8. **MCP over connectors** — prefer MCP servers over individual connector actions because they provide broader capability
9. **API verification** — every change verified via LSP pull, Dataverse query, or PAC CLI status
10. **Present options** — when 2+ viable approaches exist, create structured `decisions[]` entries with pros/cons. Recommend the best, let the user choose.
11. **Verify then mark** — never mark a build step complete until the result is confirmed via API read-back
12. **Atomic tasks** — every build step is a separate task because combining steps across systems makes failures harder to diagnose

Cache freshness: < 3 days = use as-is. 3-14 days = Tier 1 auto-refresh, Tier 2-3 flag. > 14 days = refresh immediately. After live research, update the cache file with findings and a new `last_verified` date. Upstream repos (`knowledge/upstream-repos.json`) checked on same 3-day cycle via `tools/upstream-check.js`.

## Rules Summary

These five rules apply everywhere and are restated here to counteract position bias:

1. **brief.json is the single source of truth** — the dashboard reads it, skills read it, reports generate from it
2. **Fire GPT-5.4 on EVERY interaction** — hook-enforced, no exceptions (see Rule Zero at top + `.claude/rules/gpt-co-generation.md`)
3. **Verify every build step via API read-back** before marking complete (see `.claude/rules/build-discipline.md`)
4. **Research Microsoft-first** — use cache for M365-native, live research only for external systems
5. **Attempt every MVP item** — a failed attempt with a clear error is more valuable than a silently skipped item
