This file provides guidance to Claude when working with code in this repository.

## Project Synopsis

Pocket DB is an embedded NoSQL document database for Node.js, persisted in a single append-only file. The design is inspired by SQLite (single-file, embedded) and MongoDB (document model, familiar API), but intentionally compact. Target use cases: desktop apps, CLI tools, Electron apps, prototypes, local servers, plugins, structured caches.

The core constraint is **never reserializing the entire database on write**. All writes are append-only records; the in-memory state is rebuilt by replaying the log at open time.

## Commands

```bash
npm install          # install dependencies (typescript, @types/node, eslint, tsx)
npm run build        # compile TypeScript → dist/ (ESM + CJS, see below)
npm test             # run all tests directly from .ts via tsx, no build needed
npm run test:coverage # same, with Node's native coverage instrumentation
npm run bench        # run the benchmark suite (separate "benchmarks" workspace)
npm run lint         # eslint .
```

To run a single test file:
```bash
node --import tsx --test "tests/indexes.test.ts"
```

To run tests matching a name pattern:
```bash
node --import tsx --test --test-name-pattern="creates a string index" "tests/*.test.ts"
```

Benchmarks live in `benchmarks/`, a separate npm workspace (`pocket-db-benchmarks`) so
comparison-only dependencies (better-sqlite3, lokijs, lowdb) never pollute the
published package's own `devDependencies`.

## Architecture Overview

### Layer Diagram

```
src/api/          ← public surface: open(), Database, Collection, Cursor, DocumentCache
src/search/       ← query compilation, evaluation, sort, document update operators
src/indexes/      ← primary index, secondary indexes (string/number), IndexManager
src/storage/      ← file format, binary encoding, CRC32 validation, file lock
src/native/       ← reserved for future C backend (empty, interfaces only)
```

### File Storage (`src/storage/`)

`FileStorage` is the lowest layer. It wraps a synchronous Node.js file descriptor (`node:fs` sync API — `readSync`, `writeSync`). Every write goes through `appendOperation(identifier, payload)`, which:
1. uses the in-memory `currentOffset` counter to get the write offset (initialized from `fstatSync` once at open, then maintained internally),
2. encodes the record as `[4-byte identifier][4-byte payload length][N-byte payload][4-byte CRC32]`,
3. writes it atomically (retry loop), advances `currentOffset` by `record.byteLength`, and returns the offset.

Reading a document later means calling `readOperationAtOffset(offset)` — only the bytes for that one record are read from disk.

**Bulk-read optimization (`readBulkRange(offsets)`):** given a set of offsets, reads the minimum contiguous span covering all of them — from the lowest offset to the end of the record at the highest (one extra small header read determines that record's exact length) — never the whole file. Used by the cursor's multi-candidate path (query planner selects ≥ 2 candidates) *when it's worth doing so lazily/adaptively* — see the Cursor section's "Lazy/adaptive bulk-range read" below and [ADR 0018](docs/adr/0018-lazy-bulk-read-by-limit.md) — and unconditionally by `rebuildIndex()`/`refreshIndexesAfterCompaction()` to backfill/refresh a collection's secondary indexes from every existing document in one read instead of one `readOperationAtOffset` call per document. Single-candidate reads still use `readOperationAtOffset` directly. See [ADR 0016](docs/adr/0016-bounded-candidate-range-read.md).

**Streaming replay (`readOperations()`):** a generator over a bounded sliding read window (default 8MiB, `DEFAULT_REPLAY_CHUNK_BYTES`), not a whole-file `Buffer` — peak memory during `open()`/`stats()`/`compact()` is a small multiple of the window size, not the file size. See [ADR 0017](docs/adr/0017-streaming-replay-buffer.md).

**Binary encoding conventions:**
- All multi-byte integers are big-endian.
- Payloads are zero-padded to 4-byte alignment.
- `U29` (in `u29.ts`) is a variable-length 1–4 byte unsigned 29-bit integer used for string/JSON byte lengths, using the same high-bit continuation scheme as UTF-8.
- CRC32 is computed over `identifier + length_field + payload` (everything before the checksum).

**Operation identifiers** (4 ASCII bytes, defined in `constants.ts`):
| Magic | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `ncl1` | New collection |
| `dco1` | Drop collection |
| `idx1` | Create index |
| `dix1` | Drop index |
| `put1` | Put document (insert/replace/update — always a full document) |
| `del1` | Delete document |
| `txnb` | Transaction begin |
| `txnc` | Transaction commit |
| `hol0` | Hole marker (used by compaction to pad dead space; silently skipped on replay) |

### File Lock (`src/storage/file-lock.ts`)

`FileLock.acquire(dbPath)` creates a `.lock` file next to the database using `openSync` with the `wx` (exclusive create) flag. The lock file contains the process PID. On conflict it reads the existing PID and checks if that process is alive via `process.kill(pid, 0)`. A stale lock (dead process) is removed and the acquire retried. `lock.release()` unlinks the lock file.

`open()` acquires the lock before opening storage and passes the lock instance to `PocketDatabase`, which releases it in `close()`.

### Startup / Replay (`src/api/database.ts` — `loadCollections`)

When `open()` is called, `PocketDatabase` reads every operation record sequentially from the file and replays them:
- `ncl1` → registers a `PocketCollection`.
- `dco1` → removes the collection from the registry.
- `idx1` → creates and registers an in-memory secondary index on the named collection.
- `dix1` → removes the secondary index from the named collection.
- `put1` → updates the primary index entry for that document id to the current operation's file offset (latest write wins).
- `del1` → removes the document id from the primary index and all secondary indexes.
- `txnb`/`txnc` → transaction envelope: operations between begin and commit are buffered and only applied when commit is found. If the log ends before `txnc`, the buffered operations are silently discarded (crash-safe atomic replay for batch methods).
- `hol0` → silently skipped.

Replay fails hard if an operation references an unknown collection, or if a CRC check fails on a record that is not the last one in the file. An incomplete or CRC-invalid **trailing** record (evidence of a crash mid-`appendOperation`) is instead recovered automatically: `FileStorage.readOperations()` truncates the file back to the last valid record and replay continues, and `Database.recovered` reports whether this happened (see [ADR 0019](docs/adr/0019-torn-tail-recovery-on-open.md)). Corruption in the middle of the log, and a configurable `corruption` policy for that case, remain unimplemented (see `docs/storage.md`).

Replay reads the log through `FileStorage.readOperations()`'s bounded sliding window (not a whole-file buffer — see the Bulk-read/Streaming replay notes above), so `open()`'s peak memory is a small multiple of the window size regardless of file size. `idx1` mid-log (an index created after a collection already had documents) triggers `rebuildIndex()`, which reads every existing document via one `readBulkRange()` call — this, multiplied across every index on a large, already-populated database, is the dominant cost `docs/adr/0003-replay-based-startup.md` documents as `open()`'s O(documents × indexes) scaling.

### Collection API (`src/api/collection.ts`)

`PocketCollection` holds:
- `InMemoryPrimaryIndex` — a `Map<string, { id, offset }>` keyed by document id hex string.
- `IndexManager` — holds zero or more `StringIndex` / `NumberIndex` instances.

Write path for `insertOne`:
1. Generate or validate the `_id` (24-char lowercase hex, 12-byte ObjectId format).
2. Merge `_id` into the document.
3. Call `storage.appendOperation(PUT_DOCUMENT_OPERATION, encodePutDocumentPayload(...))` → get back the file offset.
4. Update in-memory primary index and all secondary indexes with the new offset.

Batch methods (`insertMany`, `updateMany`, `deleteMany`) wrap their individual records in `txnb`/`txnc` before applying in-memory changes, giving atomic replay semantics.

`updateOne`/`updateMany` work by reading the current document (via cursor), applying the update expression in memory, then appending a new `put1` record. The old record is never modified or removed — the primary index is just updated to point to the new offset. Compaction reclaims dead space.

`replaceOne(id, doc)` and `replaceOne(doc)` (with `_id` in doc) are both valid overloads.

`updateOne(id, update)` and `updateOne(query, update)` are both valid overloads.

`deleteOne(id)` and `deleteOne(query)` are both valid overloads.

`countDocuments(query?)` delegates to `find(query).count()`.

`distinct(field, query?, options?)` iterates `find(query)` via `cursor.next()` (no `toArray()` — reading stops as soon as the limit would be exceeded) and collects the distinct values of `field`, skipping documents where it is missing. Values are deduplicated with `valuesEqual` (same rule as `$eq`/`$in`: strict equality for primitives, `JSON.stringify` structural equality for arrays/objects), so distinct object/array values are preserved rather than collapsed to a single bucket. Throws once the result would exceed `options.limit` (default `DEFAULT_DISTINCT_LIMIT = 100`) — a high-cardinality guard, not a hard cap; callers can raise it.

### Cursor (`src/api/cursor.ts`)

`find(query)` compiles the query, asks `IndexManager.plan()` for a candidate set, and returns a `PocketCursor`. The cursor captures a **snapshot** of `{ id, offset }` pairs at the moment `find()` is called. Subsequent writes do not affect open cursors (important invariant — tests explicitly verify this). Each `next()` call reads the document at its stored file offset and evaluates the residual query against it.

**`count()`**: fast path when the compiled query is match-all (`{ type: "and", predicates: [] }`) — returns `candidates.length` with zero document reads. Otherwise scans all candidates and counts matches.

**`skip()` match-all fast path:** on the unsorted path, when the residual query is match-all, `applyMatchAllSkipFastPath()` jumps `currentIndex` straight to `skipCount` before the first candidate is read — every candidate counts toward `skip` unconditionally in that case, so which ones get skipped never depends on reading them (same reasoning as `count()`'s fast path above). A non-match-all query still reads and evaluates every skipped candidate, since `skip` counts *matching* documents. Sorting bypasses this entirely (`nextSorted()` always reads every matching candidate up front, skip or not).

**`sort(spec)`**: stores the sort spec (up to 4 fields, direction `1` or `-1`). On the first `next()` call after `sort()` is set, `nextSorted()` reads all matching documents eagerly into a buffer, sorts them, then yields with skip/limit applied. Sort is always eager — there is no sorted index.

**Cache consultation:** `readCandidateDocument(candidate, forceFullRead?)` takes the full `{ id, offset }` candidate. When the cursor was given a `DocumentCache` (i.e. the collection has caching enabled), it calls `cache.get(id, offset)` first; a hit returns the cached clone with no read or decode. On a miss it reads (bulk buffer or single record), decodes, hands the decoded object to `cache.set(id, offset, doc)` by reference, and returns a clone. When the cache is `null` (default) this is the original read-and-decode path with only a single `null` check of overhead.

**Lazy/adaptive bulk-range read (see [ADR 0018](../docs/adr/0018-lazy-bulk-read-by-limit.md)):** `Collection.find()` no longer decides whether to pre-load the candidate range — that decision moved into `PocketCursor.resolveBulkRange(forceFullRead)`, made lazily on the first candidate read instead of eagerly at `find()` time, because `limit()` is only known once the caller has chained it onto the cursor `find()` returns (`findOne()` is `find(query).limit(1).next()`). Below `SCAN_PRELOAD_THRESHOLD` (`2`, now a `cursor.ts` constant) candidates it's never worth it, decided once and cached permanently. At or above threshold: with no `limit` set, or when `count()`/the sorted path force it (both must read every candidate regardless of `limit`), the whole candidate span is bulk-read immediately and cached for the cursor's life — same behavior as before, just deferred. With a `limit` set and no forcing, the decision returns `null` *without* caching it, so `next()` falls back to per-record `readOperationAtOffset` reads — a `findOne()`/`find().limit(N)` on a large, unindexed, high-match-rate query never touches the rest of the candidate span. `next()` tracks per-record reads made while still deferred and forces the bulk-range decision once `MAX_PER_RECORD_READS_BEFORE_BULK_ESCALATION` (`256`) is hit without satisfying the limit — bounding the worst case for a rare-match or absent-match query under a small limit to a fixed number of extra small reads before falling back to one bulk read, instead of scanning the whole candidate set one record at a time.

### Sort (`src/search/sort.ts`)

- `parseSortSpec(spec)`: validates max 4 fields, direction must be `1` or `-1`.
- `compareDocuments(a, b, fields)`: iterates sort fields left-to-right, multiplies natural comparison by direction.
- `compareValues(a, b)`: missing/null/undefined/NaN → treated as minimum value (-1). Type ranks: boolean=1, number=2, string=3. Arrays and objects throw. Combined with direction: missing values appear **first** in ascending, **last** in descending.

### Query Planning (`src/indexes/index-manager.ts` — `plan`)

`IndexManager.plan(compiledQuery, primaryIndex)` extracts all `FieldPredicate` nodes from the compiled query tree and checks whether any registered index can answer them. If an index returns candidates, the planner picks the index with the fewest candidates (smallest result set). The full query is always re-evaluated against each candidate document as a residual filter.

`fieldPredicates()` only recurses into `and` nodes. It returns `[]` for `or` and `nor` nodes — disjunctive queries cannot be answered by a single index scan (would miss documents from unscanned branches).

### Query Compilation (`src/search/compile-query.ts`)

Supported query operators: `$eq` (implicit from bare value), `$ne`, `$gt`, `$gte`, `$lt`, `$lte`, `$in`, `$nin`, `$exists`, `$type`, `$regex` (with `$options`), `$not`, `$and`, `$or`, `$nor`.

`$type` matches a field by its JSON type. The operand is a single type name or an array of names (matches if any). Accepted names: `null`, `boolean` (alias `bool`), `number`, `string`, `array`, `object` — `array`/`object`/`null` are kept distinct. A missing field never matches. Always evaluated in the residual pass (no index support).

Unsupported operators throw at compile time.

`$regex` accepts a pattern string (flags via `$options`), a `RegExp` instance (flags on the RegExp; mutually exclusive with `$options`), or a bare `RegExp` condition as shorthand. Allowed flags: `i`, `m`, `s`, `u` — `g` and `y` throw at compile time because they make `RegExp.test` stateful. Matches string values only; always evaluated in the residual pass (no index support).

`$not` validation: value must be a non-null, non-array object with at least one key. Empty object `{}` throws because `isOperatorObject({})` returns false (no `$`-keys), so the empty-key check (`Object.keys(value).length === 0`) is done explicitly before calling `compileFieldOperators`.

`CompiledQuery` is a union:
```ts
type CompiledQuery = AndPredicate | OrPredicate | NorPredicate | FieldPredicate
```

### Query Evaluation (`src/search/evaluate-query.ts`)

- `and`: every predicate must match.
- `or`: at least one predicate must match; empty array returns `false`.
- `nor`: no predicate must match; empty array returns `true`.
- `field`: evaluate all operators against the field value.
- `not`: negates the conjunction of its inner operators.
- `ne`: strict inequality.
- `gte` / `lte`: inclusive comparison using the same `compareValues` logic as sort.
- `nin`: every candidate must not equal the field value.
- `exists`: checks presence of the field in the document.
- `regex`: `RegExp.test` on string values only; non-strings and missing fields never match.

### Update Operators (`src/search/update-document.ts`)

Supported: `$set`, `$unset`, `$min`, `$max`, `$inc`, `$mul`, `$rename`, `$currentDate`, `$push`, `$addToSet`, `$pop`, `$pull`, `$pullAll`.  
Unsupported operators throw. `_id` is immutable — `$set`, `$unset`, `$currentDate`, and `$rename` (as source or target) on `_id` all throw (enforced by `assertUpdateDoesNotMutateId` in `collection.ts`).

Semantics: `$inc`/`$mul`/`$min`/`$max` require an existing number field. Array operators (`$push`, `$addToSet`, `$pop`, `$pull`, `$pullAll`) require an existing array field. `$rename` with a missing source is a no-op; an existing target is overwritten. `$currentDate`: `true` / `{ $type: "date" }` → ISO-8601 string, `{ $type: "timestamp" }` → epoch ms. `$pull` accepts a literal (deep equality) or a field operator expression (e.g. `{ $gte: 5 }`) evaluated per array element. `$pop` takes `1` (last) or `-1` (first); empty arrays are a no-op.

### Secondary Indexes (`src/indexes/`)

**`StringIndex`**: maps `string field value → Map<id, candidate>`. Skips non-string fields. Answers `$eq` and `$in` predicates only; range predicates fall through to full scan.

**`NumberIndex`**: maps `number field value → Map<id, candidate>` with a maintained sorted array for range queries. Skips non-finite numbers. Answers `$eq`, `$in`, `$gt`, `$gte`, `$lt`, `$lte` predicates. `ne`, `nin`, `not`, `exists` return `null` (full scan fallback). `NumberRange` has four bounds: `minExclusive`, `minInclusive`, `maxExclusive`, `maxInclusive`.

Index definitions are persisted in the log (`idx1`). Index contents are rebuilt from the log every time the database opens (secondary indexes are not checkpointed to disk yet).

**`InMemoryPrimaryIndex`**: handles `_id` equality and `$in` lookups. `snapshot()` returns all `{ id, offset }` pairs for full-collection scans.

**Unique indexes.** `createIndex(field, { type, unique: true })` (default `unique: false`) turns a `StringIndex`/`NumberIndex` into a uniqueness constraint. Every `QueryIndex` implements `findOwner(document, excludeId?)` (the id currently holding the same value, if any) and `findDuplicate()` (scans the index's own contents for any value shared by more than one id). `IndexManager.assertUnique(document, excludeId?)` and `IndexManager.assertUniqueBatch(entries)` call `findOwner` across every `unique` index and throw on conflict; `assertUniqueBatch` additionally tracks values seen earlier in the same batch, since sibling documents in `insertMany`/`updateMany` are invisible to each other until the batch is applied. These are called from `PocketCollection` **before** `appendPutDocument` in `insertOne`, `insertMany`, `replaceOne`, `updateOne`, and `updateMany` — writes are append-only, so the check must happen ahead of the append, not after. `excludeId` is the document's own id for in-place writes (replace/update), so a document can keep its own value. Only values matching the index's own type participate (same guard as `add()`); a missing field or wrong-typed value never conflicts. Creating a `unique` index over a collection with pre-existing duplicates populates the index, detects the conflict via `findDuplicate()`, removes the index again, and throws — nothing is persisted. The `unique` flag itself is persisted in `idx1` (see Operation identifiers table below).

### Document Cache (`src/api/document-cache.ts`)

`DocumentCache` is an optional, per-collection, byte-bounded LRU of parsed "hot" documents. It is **disabled by default**: `PocketCollection` holds `cache: DocumentCache | null = null` and only instantiates the object on `enableCache(maxBytes)`, so a collection that never opts in pays only a single `null` check on the read/write paths (this is a hard requirement — caching must have no impact when off).

Entries are keyed by `_id` hex and stored as `{ document, offset, bytes }`:
- **Keyed by id** so a document stays cached across updates (the offset moves) and across compaction (ids/contents don't change). The cost is explicit invalidation on the write path.
- **Versioned by offset.** `get(id, offset)` returns a hit only when the stored offset matches the caller's expected offset. This preserves the cursor-snapshot invariant: a cursor reading from an older snapshot offset *misses* a newer cached entry and reads its own version from disk. After a write, the entry is refreshed with the new offset so steady-state reads hit again.
- **Ownership/cloning.** `set` takes ownership by reference (callers must not mutate afterwards — the write path builds fresh docs, the read path decodes fresh docs). `get` returns a `structuredClone`, preserving the contract that query results are independent, caller-owned objects. The clone-on-read is the cache's main cost and is outweighed by skipping the read + decode (see benchmarks).
- **Eviction.** LRU via `Map` insertion order; `get`/`set` re-insert to mark most-recently-used; the first key is least-recently-used. A document larger than the whole budget is not cached. Byte size is estimated by `estimateDocumentBytes` (`JSON.stringify(doc).length * 2`), overridable via `sizeOf`.

The cache is purely in-memory and never persisted — empty on every open, like secondary indexes.

**Integration in `PocketCollection`** (single chokepoints): `find()` passes the cache to the cursor; `applyPutDocument` (insert/replace/update) calls `cache.set(id, offset, doc)` to prime/refresh for free; `deletePrimaryIndexEntry` calls `cache.invalidate(id)`; `dropFromReplay` calls `cache.clear()`; `compact()` needs no cache action (ids/contents unchanged). Public methods: `enableCache(maxBytes)`, `disableCache()`, `cacheStats(): DocumentCacheStats | null`.

**Known limitations (deliberate, V1):** the bulk-read path still reads the full candidate range contiguously even when some candidates are cached (a future change can restrict the read to the *missing* range); large scans populate the cache and can cause LRU scan pollution if the budget is smaller than the scan footprint; the cache is lazy only (no eager fully-resident mode — a budget larger than the collection does not pre-load at open).

### Compaction (`src/api/database.ts` — `compact`)

`compact()` rewrites the database file in a single forward pass:
1. Opens a temporary file alongside the database file.
2. Writes the file header.
3. For each live collection: writes its `ncl1` record, all its live documents (`put1` at new offsets), and any active secondary indexes (`idx1`).
4. Atomically replaces the original file with the temporary file (`renameSync`).
5. Reopens the storage on the new file, updates all primary index entries to the new offsets, and refreshes all secondary index contents.

Dead records (old `put1` versions, `del1`, `txnb`/`txnc`, `hol0`, dropped collections/indexes) are simply not written. The file shrinks to only live data.

### Document IDs

12-byte ObjectId layout (same schema as MongoDB ObjectId):
```
[4 bytes unix timestamp] [5 bytes process-random] [3 bytes counter]
```
Exposed as 24-character lowercase hex strings. When the user supplies `_id` on insert, it must match `/^[0-9a-f]{24}$/`.

### Public API (`src/index.ts`)

All exports are from `src/index.ts`:
```ts
export { open, pocketDb } from "./api/open.js";
export type {
  Collection, CreateIndexOptions, CreateIndexResult, Cursor, Database,
  DeleteManyResult, DeleteOneResult, DropIndexResult, DropResult,
  IndexInfo, InsertManyResult, InsertOneResult, OpenOptions, ReplaceOneResult, UpdateResult
} from "./api/types.js";
export type { SortDirection } from "./search/sort.js";
export type { DocumentCacheStats } from "./api/document-cache.js";
```

`pocketDb` is a convenience alias for `open()`. When its first argument is a `string` it is treated as `options.path`; the optional second argument accepts the same `OpenOptions` minus `path`. Both call sites are equivalent:
```ts
open({ path: "./data.pdb" })
pocketDb("./data.pdb")
```

`Collection` interface does **not** expose `id: Buffer` or `existsId()` — those are internal to `PocketCollection`. Tests that need the internal collection id (low-level storage tests) cast to `(collection as any).id`.

`Database` exposes `getCollections(): string[]` and `existsCollection(name): boolean` for introspection without side-effects (unlike `collection()` which creates on first access).

`Collection` exposes `getIndexes(): IndexInfo[]` (where `IndexInfo = { name: string; type: string; unique: boolean }`) and `existsIndex(name): boolean` for index introspection.

`Collection` exposes the hot-document cache controls `enableCache(maxBytes: number): void`, `disableCache(): void`, and `cacheStats(): DocumentCacheStats | null` (`null` when disabled). The cache is off by default; see the Document Cache section above. `DocumentCacheStats` is exported from the package root.

`Database.stats(): DatabaseStats` and `Collection.stats(): CollectionStats` report usage. The cheap fields — `sizeOnDisk` (from `FileStorage.size`, the in-memory `currentOffset`), `collectionCount`, `documentCount` (primary index `size`), `indexCount` — come straight from memory. The history fields — `operationCount`, `tombstoneCount`, `liveBytes`, `deadBytes` — require one forward scan of the log (`computeStorageStats` in `database.ts`), which reuses `shouldKeepOperation` for liveness so `deadBytes` is exactly what `compact()` would reclaim. Records of dropped collections count toward the global totals but are not attributed to any collection. Per-collection stats are produced by the same scan and injected into `PocketCollection` as a `storageStats` callback (no back-reference to the database). The invariant `sizeOnDisk === FILE_HEADER_BYTES + liveBytes + deadBytes` always holds.

### TypeScript Configuration

- **ESM only** (`"type": "module"`, `"module": "NodeNext"`). All internal imports must use `.js` extensions even for `.ts` source files.
- Strict mode enabled. `target: "ES2022"`.
- `outDir: "dist"`, only `src/**/*` is included — `tsc` infers `rootDir: "src"`, so the build is flat (`dist/index.js`, `dist/cjs/index.js`), no `dist/src/` nesting. Tests and benchmarks are never compiled.
- Tests use Node's built-in `node:test` runner and `node:assert/strict`, executed straight from `.ts` via `node --import tsx --test`. No external test framework, no build step.

## Key Invariants and Design Decisions

- **Writes are synchronous.** There is currently no async I/O, no write queue. This keeps the execution model simple for single-process embedded use.
- **No in-place updates.** Every write is an append. The primary index maps id → latest offset. The file only grows until compaction.
- **Cursors snapshot at creation.** `find()` captures the candidate list immediately; later mutations are invisible to that cursor.
- **Indexes narrow; documents filter.** Even with an index, the cursor always re-evaluates the full compiled query against each document read from disk. Indexes can only be used to reduce candidates, not to skip the document read.
- **Secondary indexes are in-memory only.** They are rebuilt from the log at startup. Persisted index snapshots are planned for V2.
- **Batch methods are atomic on replay.** `insertMany`, `updateMany`, `deleteMany` wrap their records in `txnb`/`txnc`. If the process crashes mid-batch, the uncommitted records are ignored on next open.
- **Single process only.** A `.lock` file prevents concurrent opens from different processes. Multiple writers on the same file are not supported and will corrupt the database.
- **Sort is always eager.** `sort()` reads all matching candidates before returning the first result. Narrow the candidate set with an indexed query before sorting.
- **Missing values sort at minimum.** `null`, `undefined`, and `NaN` rank below all typed values. With direction applied: first in ascending, last in descending.
- **The document cache is off by default and free when off.** No `DocumentCache` is instantiated until `enableCache()`; the read/write paths only pay a `null` check. It is keyed by id and versioned by offset, so it never violates cursor-snapshot semantics, and it stays correct across updates/deletes/compaction.
- **Unique constraints are checked before the append, never after.** Because writes cannot be rolled back once appended, `assertUnique`/`assertUniqueBatch` run against the fully-built document ahead of `appendPutDocument`. A rejected `insertMany`/`updateMany` batch writes nothing at all.
- **A torn trailing record is recovered automatically, not treated as corruption.** `open()`'s replay pass (`FileStorage.readOperations()`) discards an incomplete or CRC-invalid record only when it is the last one in the file — evidence of a crash mid-`appendOperation` — truncating back to the last valid record before continuing. `Database.recovered` reports whether this happened. A CRC mismatch on a record that is *not* the last one in the file still fails hard; see [ADR 0019](docs/adr/0019-torn-tail-recovery-on-open.md).

- `skip()` and `limit()` on cursor
- Manual compaction (`db.compact()`)
- Single-process file lock (`.lock` file with PID + stale detection)
- Bulk-range-read optimization (`readBulkRange`) for multi-candidate scans and index rebuild/refresh — bounded to the candidate span, not the whole file (see [ADR 0016](docs/adr/0016-bounded-candidate-range-read.md))
- `skip()` match-all fast path — O(1) instead of O(skipCount) document reads when the residual query is match-all
- Bounded-memory streaming replay (`readOperations()`, 8MiB sliding window) — `open()`/`stats()`/`compact()` peak memory no longer scales with file size (see [ADR 0017](docs/adr/0017-streaming-replay-buffer.md))
- Lazy/adaptive bulk-range read keyed on `limit` — `findOne()`/`find().limit(N)` on a large, unindexed, high-match-rate query no longer pays for a bulk read sized to the whole candidate set (bounded per-record escalation cap for rare/absent matches under a limit) (see [ADR 0018](docs/adr/0018-lazy-bulk-read-by-limit.md))
- `pocketDb(path, options?)` convenience alias for `open()`
- `Database.getCollections()` / `Database.existsCollection(name)`
- `Collection.getIndexes()` / `Collection.existsIndex(name)`
- `Database.stats()` / `Collection.stats()` (size on disk, document/operation/tombstone counts, reclaimable bytes)
- Optional hot-document cache: `Collection.enableCache()` / `disableCache()` / `cacheStats()` (off by default, id-keyed + offset-versioned LRU)
- `durability: "strict" | "relaxed"` option in `OpenOptions` (fsync after every write vs. OS page cache)
- Automatic torn-tail recovery on `open()` (`Database.recovered`) — a crash mid-write no longer makes the database unopenable; see [ADR 0019](docs/adr/0019-torn-tail-recovery-on-open.md)
- Clean public API surface and TypeScript exports
- Benchmarks vs. SQLite (in-memory and file-backed), JSON file, lowdb, and LokiJS, plus a cache vs. no-cache `pocket-db` comparison
- Large-scale, real-data benchmark (`benchmarks/large-scale.ts`, `npm run bench:large`) — read-only by default; `--rebuild-indexes` opt-in measures index rebuild cost against a copy

**V2 planned:** persisted index snapshots, automatic compaction, read snapshots, streaming scan, improved query planner, `$or`/`$nor` index support (the operators themselves are already fully supported for query evaluation — see Query Compilation above — only index-assisted planning for disjunctive queries is still a full-scan fallback).

**V3 planned:** compound indexes, lightweight transactions, compression, optional native C engine.

## Test Patterns

All tests create a fresh temporary directory per test (using `mkdtempSync`) and clean up in `afterEach`. Database files use `.pdb` extension. Tests import directly from `src/` and run straight from `.ts` via `tsx` — no build step required before `npm test`.

When testing storage-layer behavior (e.g. crash recovery, transaction replay), tests manipulate `FileStorage` directly and re-open the database to verify replay semantics. These tests cast `(collection as any).id` to access the internal collection Buffer id needed to construct raw payloads.

`existsId()` was removed from the public `Collection` interface. Tests that previously used it now use `findOne({ _id }) !== null` (with the assertion made before `db.close()` since `findOne` reads from disk).

The hot-document cache is covered by `tests/document-cache.test.ts`: unit tests construct `DocumentCache` directly (imported from `src/api/document-cache.js`) to exercise offset versioning, LRU eviction, oversized-doc rejection, shrink-to-fit, and stats; integration tests go through `Collection.enableCache()` and assert priming on insert, hotness across updates, invalidation on delete, the cursor-snapshot invariant *with the cache enabled* (replace mid-cursor, still read the old version), and that mutating a returned document does not corrupt the cache. The benchmark adds a `pocket-db (relaxed-json-cache)` adapter (cache enabled via a `cache` token in the adapter mode) and a `findByIdHot (16)` case to compare against the non-cached adapter.

Unique indexes are covered by `tests/unique-index.test.ts`: creation-time checks (default non-unique, creating over empty/conflict-free/conflicting collections, type/missing-field exemptions, re-creating with a mismatched `unique` flag), write-path enforcement across `insertOne`/`insertMany`/`replaceOne`/`updateOne`/`updateMany` (including in-batch collisions and "keep my own value" cases), and persistence across reopen and `compact()`. The cross-engine benchmark suite (`benchmarks/`) was intentionally left untouched — `unique` is a pocket-db-only construct not shared by the comparison adapters (SQLite, lowdb, LokiJS, JSON-file), and the existing `BenchDocument` schema has no field that's naturally unique per document.
