# AI Agent Rules for qubership-envgene Repository

This document contains guidelines and rules for AI coding assistants working with this repository.

## Documentation Structure (Diátaxis Framework)

This repository follows the [Diátaxis documentation framework](https://github.com/evildmp/diataxis-documentation-framework).

### Documentation Types

1. **How-to Guides** (`/docs/how-to/`)
   - Goal-oriented, practical steps
   - Solve specific problems
   - Minimal theory, maximum action
   - Target: ~200-400 lines

2. **Explanation** (`/docs/features/`)
   - Conceptual understanding
   - "Why" questions
   - Background and context
   - Design decisions and trade-offs

3. **Reference** (`/docs/`)
   - Technical specifications
   - Object schemas
   - API documentation
   - Factual, precise

4. **Tutorials** (`/docs/tutorials/`)
   - Learning-oriented
   - Step-by-step for beginners
   - Complete working example

### When Creating Documentation

**✅ DO:**

- Keep how-to guides focused and practical
- Separate theory into explanation documents
- Link between documentation types
- Use clear, descriptive titles
- Include realistic examples from the codebase

**❌ DON'T:**

- Mix how-to and explanation in one document
- Create long (>500 lines) how-to guides
- Include detailed theory in practical guides
- Use fantasy/made-up examples

---

## Always-loaded essentials

### Verify, don't fabricate

When a documentation statement names a specific identifier - a parameter, environment variable, file
path, library symbol - that identifier is confirmed in the source it describes. Unverifiable
identifiers are open questions, not statements of fact.

For object schemas and example fields, see also
[Object Examples in Documentation](#object-examples-in-documentation).

❌ **INCORRECT:**

- Naming a CI variable for a service by extending a pattern from a sibling service, without checking
  the implementation.
- Listing a config file path from memory without grepping the repository.
- Assuming a library exposes an env-var auth method by analogy with another component.

✅ **CORRECT:**

- Grep or read the source code to confirm the identifier before stating it.
- Mark the identifier as an open question until verifiable.

**Scope:** Applies to **new and modified content only**.

**Why:** Documentation is consumed as authoritative. A fabricated detail propagates into tickets,
validation rules, and tooling assumptions.

---

### Use existing vocabulary

If the document already defines terms, types, and notations for a domain, reuse them. Parallel
vocabulary - new section titles, column labels, role names - for concepts the document already covers
is avoided.

❌ **INCORRECT:**

- Inventing a column name that describes the same property an existing column already covers.
- Adding a structural subsection that duplicates an existing section type.
- Coining a new term when the document already names the same concept.

✅ **CORRECT:**

- Reuse the document's existing terms for the same concepts.
- If new vocabulary is genuinely needed, introduce it in a definitions section.

**Scope:** Applies to **new and modified content only**.

**Why:** Parallel vocabulary forces readers to maintain two mental glossaries and produces ambiguous
cross-references.

---

### Define every term

**Every domain term a document uses is defined. A term used in one document is defined in that document. A term
used across documents is defined once in the glossary, and each document links to it.**

Three rules govern terminology. This rule governs whether a definition exists and where it lives.
[Use existing vocabulary](#use-existing-vocabulary) governs which term to pick.
[Don't re-gloss established terms](#dont-re-gloss-established-terms) governs how often to restate it.

The glossary lives at [/docs/glossary.md](/docs/glossary.md). A term needs a definition when a competent reader
from outside this repository could misread it. This covers ordinary words used with a specific meaning here,
such as Environment or Effective Set.

- **Single-document term.** Define it on first use in that document, as a sentence, a parenthetical, or a short
  definitions list.
- **Cross-document term.** Add or reuse a glossary entry, then link to it from each document instead of
  restating the definition.
- **Promotion.** When a term defined in one document starts appearing in a second, write a glossary entry for
  it and replace the inline definition in both documents with a link.

❌ **INCORRECT:**

- Using a shared term such as Deploy Postfix with a fresh inline definition in each document that mentions it.
- Introducing a term with no definition in the document or the glossary, leaving the reader to infer it.

✅ **CORRECT:**

- A term local to one how-to guide is defined in that guide.
- A term shared by [calculator-cli.md](/docs/features/calculator-cli.md) and
  [envgene-objects.md](/docs/envgene-objects.md) has one glossary entry that both documents link to.

**Scope:** Applies to **new and modified content only**. Existing multi-document terms are back-filled into the
glossary only when the surrounding lines are edited for other reasons.

**Why:** An undefined term forces the reader to guess or search. A term defined once and linked keeps every
document consistent when the definition changes, and it stops the same concept from drifting into different
meanings across documents.

---

### Don't re-gloss established terms

**Once the document defines a term, use it bare. Do not append the definition, type tag, or
location to every reference.**

The rule covers both classes of re-glossing - inline type or definition tags, and inline location or
path bindings.

❌ **INCORRECT - definition repeated** (every mention re-glosses the type tag):

```markdown
The runtime context does not accept external Credentials (`type: external`).
Local Credentials (`type: usernamePassword` / `secret`) are emitted as plain text.
Built-in credential references resolve to a Credential (`type: external` or `type: usernamePassword` / `secret`).
```

❌ **INCORRECT - location repeated** (every mention restates the path):

```markdown
The generator reads the schema at `/schemas/credentials.schema.json`.
If the schema at `/schemas/credentials.schema.json` is missing, the build fails.
Validation rules at `/schemas/credentials.schema.json` are checked before output.
```

✅ **CORRECT** (terms used bare):

```markdown
The runtime context does not accept external Credentials.
Local Credentials are emitted as plain text.
Built-in credential references resolve to a Credential.
```

```markdown
The credentials schema lives at `/schemas/credentials.schema.json`.

The generator reads the schema. If the schema is missing, the build fails. Validation rules
are checked before output.
```

**Exceptions where the inline detail is justified:**

- **First mention** in the document, especially when the term appears before its definition section in
  reading order. The parenthetical serves as a forward-defining hint.
- **Conditions or filters** that pick a subset, not a redefinition. "External Credential with `create: true`"
  is a filter, not a redefinition of "external".
- **Taxonomy tables** that explicitly map terms to bindings, like a Components or Glossary table.
- **Operational instructions** where the reader copies the exact path or value to act on it.

**Scope:** Applies to **new and modified content only**.

**Why:** Each repetition of a binding is a maintenance liability - when a type renames, an enum value
is added, or a path moves, every parenthetical or location must be updated. Established vocabulary
lets readers internalize the term and frees the doc from re-glossing, whether the gloss is a type
tag or a file path.

---

### In-repo links

**Use repo-root absolute paths for in-repo cross-references, not GitHub URLs.**

For links between Markdown files inside this repository, use paths starting from the repository
root (`/docs/...`, `/schemas/...`). Do not use absolute GitHub URLs
(`https://github.com/Netcracker/qubership-envgene/blob/main/...`), and do not use relative paths
(`../how-to/...`).

External references (links to other repositories, third-party docs, blog posts) keep their full
`https://` URL. This rule applies to in-repo cross-references only.

❌ **INCORRECT** (absolute GitHub URL pins to `main` regardless of context):

```markdown
See [Creating a cluster](https://github.com/Netcracker/qubership-envgene/blob/main/docs/how-to/create-cluster.md).
```

❌ **INCORRECT** (relative path breaks when files move):

```markdown
See [Creating a cluster](../how-to/create-cluster.md).
```

✅ **CORRECT** (repo-root absolute path):

```markdown
See [Creating a cluster](/docs/how-to/create-cluster.md).
```

**Scope:** Applies to **new and modified content only**. Existing absolute or relative links are
not affected unless the surrounding lines are being edited for other reasons.

**Why:** Repo-root absolute paths render correctly on GitHub regardless of branch or fork. GitHub
URLs pin to a specific branch (usually `main`), so a fork or feature-branch viewer following the
link is taken back to `main` instead of staying in the current context. Relative paths break when
the linking file or the target file is moved.

---

## Code Style

### YAML

- Use 2-space indentation
- Quote string values consistently
- Add comments for complex logic
- Use meaningful key names

---

## English style

### Dialect

**Default to British English. Yield to existing dialect when a repository already uses American
spelling consistently.**

- **Spelling.** `-ise` endings (`organise`, `organisation`); `-our` (`colour`, `behaviour`);
  `-re` (`centre`, `metre`); doubled consonants in past tense (`travelled`, `signalled`).
- **Quotation marks.** Single quotation marks in body prose for British style; either is fine
  in code or inline literals where the syntax requires.
- **Date format.** `DD Month YYYY` (`15 March 2026`). Avoid all-numeric `dd/mm/yyyy` because it
  is ambiguous with `mm/dd/yyyy`.
- **Word choices.** `while` not `whilst`; `among` not `amongst`. Contractions (`don't`,
  `it's`, `you'll`) are fine in both dialects.
- **Yield rule.** If a repository's existing prose is mostly US-spelled, treat it as `en-US`
  and match. Never mix dialects within a file. A pinned dialect in `CONTRIBUTING.md` or a Vale
  config wins.

The Oxford serial comma stays in both dialects - see [Oxford comma](#oxford-comma).

**Scope:** Applies to **new and modified content only**.

**Why:** Consistent dialect within a file removes friction. Defaulting to one dialect prevents
docs from drifting into mixed spelling. British English matches the qubership convention.

---

### Dashes

**CRITICAL: Always use a regular hyphen-minus (`-`) as a dash in prose. Never use em dashes (`—`) or en dashes (`–`).**

❌ **INCORRECT:**

```markdown
EnvGene searches these locations — from bottom to top — and uses the first match.
```

✅ **CORRECT:**

```markdown
EnvGene searches these locations - from bottom to top - and uses the first match.
```

**Why:** Em dashes are a typographic convention that varies by locale and style guide. A plain hyphen-minus is universally readable, renders consistently across all Markdown renderers, and avoids accidental character encoding issues.

### Semicolons

**Avoid semicolons in prose. Split into separate sentences instead.**

❌ **AVOID:**

```markdown
Native callouts render with icons; bold-text variants are plain blockquotes.
```

✅ **PREFER:**

```markdown
Native callouts render with icons. Bold-text variants are plain blockquotes.
```

**Scope:** Applies to **new and modified content only**. Existing content using semicolons is
not affected by this rule and does not need rewriting unless the surrounding lines are being
edited for other reasons.

**Why:** Two short sentences read more naturally on screen than one compound sentence linked by
a semicolon. Also reduces AI-stylized rhythm in generated text.

---

### Oxford comma

**Use a serial (Oxford) comma in lists of three or more items.**

❌ **INCORRECT:**

```markdown
The pipeline reads `A`, `B` and `C`.
```

✅ **CORRECT:**

```markdown
The pipeline reads `A`, `B`, and `C`.
```

**Scope:** Applies to **new and modified content only**.

**Why:** The serial comma removes parsing ambiguity in lists with conjunctions inside list items
and matches the OUP, Google, and Microsoft style guides.

---

### Heading case

**Use sentence case for all headings: capitalize the first word and proper nouns only.**

Proper nouns include product names, feature names, brand names, and code identifiers
(`envgeneNullValue`, `ParameterSet`, `Cloud Passport`, `EnvGene`).

❌ **INCORRECT:**

```markdown
## How to Resolve Credentials
### Verification Step (Required)
#### Generated `credentials.yml` (Username/Password)
```

✅ **CORRECT:**

```markdown
## How to resolve credentials
### Verification step (required)
#### Generated `credentials.yml` (username/password)
```

**Scope:** Applies to **new and modified content only**. Existing headings in Title Case are not
affected by this rule and do not need rewriting unless the surrounding lines are being edited
for other reasons.

**Recommended (not required):** When editing a Markdown file for any other reason, consider
bringing its remaining Title Case headings to sentence case in the same PR. For large files
(many headings, large TOC), a separate dedicated migration PR is preferred to keep the original
change reviewable. Reviewers may suggest opportunistic migration but must not block merge over it.

**Why:** Aligns with the GitHub Docs convention and modern dev-doc style guides (Google,
Microsoft, Mozilla, GitHub). Sentence case has fewer rules (no debate about which prepositions
or conjunctions to capitalize), keeps proper nouns visually distinct from generic words,
translates more cleanly to non-English locales, and is the established convention across modern
technical documentation.

---

### Compound modifiers

**Hyphenate compound modifiers when they appear before the noun they qualify.**

❌ **INCORRECT:**

```markdown
A well known parameter.
```

✅ **CORRECT:**

```markdown
A well-known parameter.
```

Compound modifiers that appear **after** the noun do not need a hyphen: "The parameter is well
known."

**Scope:** Applies to **new and modified content only**.

**Why:** Hyphenation signals "treat these words as one unit". Without it, readers parse
adjective-noun-noun and stumble on the boundary.

---

### Vocabulary

**Choose common words. Define unfamiliar ones. Pick one term per concept.**

The rule covers vocabulary choices that hurt non-native readers most:

- **Common verbs over Latinate ones.** "use" not "utilize", "help" not "facilitate", "do" not
  "perform", "let" not "permit", "set" not "establish", "try" not "endeavour", "happen" not
  "transpire", "spread" not "proliferate", "outline" not "delineate", "above" not
  "aforementioned". Domain Latinate verbs that name a concept of art (`orchestrate`,
  `instantiate`, `obfuscate`) stay.
- **English over Latin abbreviations.** "for example" not "e.g.", "that is" not "i.e.", "and so
  on" not "etc.".
- **One term per concept.** Pick one and stick with it across the document.
- **Use specific verbs.** Avoid vague `be`, `have`, `do`, `make` when a specific verb names the
  action. "The pipeline validates the inputs", not "The pipeline does the validation".
- **Define acronyms on first use; prefer full names.** Spell out the acronym at first mention
  with the short form in parentheses. Bare acronyms are fine after that.
- **Avoid metaphorical phrasal verbs.** Drop spatial metaphors (`wired into`, `tied into`,
  `bolted on`, `plugged into`), causality metaphors (`ends up`, `winds up`, `boils down to`,
  `comes out to`), and activity metaphors (`kicks in`, `picks up`, `falls through`). Replace
  with a direct verb: `wired into` → `uses`, or `ends up X` → `becomes X` (or just `is X`). Operational
  phrasals stay - they are the canonical term: `set up`, `look up`, `roll back`, `fall back`,
  `back up`, `log in`/`log out`, `sign up`.

❌ **INCORRECT:**

```markdown
The CR includes acceptance criteria from UC steps.
```

✅ **CORRECT:**

```markdown
The change-request (CR) issue includes acceptance criteria from use-case (UC) steps.
```

**Scope:** Applies to **new and modified content only**. Established repository acronyms used in
filenames (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`) need no expansion.

**Why:** Common and specific vocabulary reads faster across language backgrounds. Acronyms
expanded on first use spare readers a hunt for the definition.

---

### Sentence craft

**One main idea per sentence; active voice; no noun stacks; parallel construction in lists.**

- **One main idea per sentence.** Split long compound sentences into two. Target no more than 25
  words.
- **One main idea per paragraph.** The first sentence carries the point; the rest supports it.
- **Active voice for behaviour statements.** "The calculator emits X" not "X is emitted by the
  calculator".
- **No idioms, metaphors, or office-speak.** "Out of the box", "low-hanging fruit", "hands
  down", "moving the needle", "circle back", "touch base", "deep dive", "drill down", "boil
  the ocean", "stakeholder buy-in", "take this offline" - drop them. They do not translate
  and read awkwardly to non-native English speakers.
- **No noun stacks.** Long chains of nouns ("application instance environment configuration
  file") force readers to parse syntactic structure on the fly. Split into a possessive or
  prepositional phrase.
- **No adjective stacks.** Three or more adjectives before a noun (`a robust scalable cloud-native
  message broker`) is a rewrite signal. Pick the one adjective that earns the spot or drop them
  all.
- **Parallel structure in lists and headings.** Every bullet starts with the same part of
  speech; every step uses the same imperative form.

❌ **INCORRECT** (mixed forms):

```markdown
- Configure replicas
- Setting retention
- Restart node
```

✅ **CORRECT** (parallel imperatives):

```markdown
- Configure replicas
- Set retention
- Restart node
```

**Scope:** Applies to **new and modified content only**.

**Why:** Short, active, parallel sentences read at a steady pace. Parsing speed matters most
when the reader's first language is not English.

---

### Pronouns and modifiers

**Pronoun references and modifier placement carry weight in technical prose. Keep them
unambiguous.**

- **Avoid ambiguous pronouns; repeat the noun if there is any doubt.** With multiple actors in a
  paragraph, `it` and `this` lose their referent fast.
- **Place modifiers next to what they modify.** `only`, `just`, `also`, `even`, `not` belong
  immediately before the word they qualify.
- **Avoid gerund subordinate clauses; use `you` or `to`.** Replace `When configuring the
  cluster...` with `When you configure the cluster...` or `To configure the cluster...`.

❌ **INCORRECT** (ambiguous pronoun, then ambiguous `only`, then gerund clause):

```markdown
The validator reads the config. It applies the rules. It then reports findings.
The hook only runs on changed files.
When configuring the cluster, set the region.
```

✅ **CORRECT:**

```markdown
The validator reads the config, applies the rules, and reports findings.
The hook runs only on changed files.
When you configure the cluster, set the region.
```

**Scope:** Applies to **new and modified content only**.

**Why:** Ambiguous pronouns, misplaced modifiers, and headless gerund clauses are translation
traps. They force re-reading even when each word is familiar.

---

### Voice and tense

**Speak directly to the reader. Describe the system in the present.**

- **Use second person (`you`, `your`); reserve `we` for an actual team decision.** Imperatives
  address the reader directly: "Set the region" not "We set the region".
- **Lead with the answer (Bottom Line Up Front).** Put the verb the reader runs, or the
  conclusion they need, in the first clause. Detail follows.
- **Specific, not promotional.** Say what the thing does, not that it is `powerful`,
  `seamless`, `robust`, `next-generation`, `industry-leading`, `best-in-class`, or
  `cutting-edge`. Skip release-note verbs: `revolutionize`, `unlock`, `transform`, `empower`,
  `accelerate`, `streamline`. Drop words that do not pay rent.
- **No throat-clearing or page-topic self-description.** Skip filler openers - `It's worth
  noting that...`, `It's important to remember...`, `Let's explore...`, `This guide explains
  how to...`, `In this section, we will cover...`. Start with the thing.
- **Present tense for system behaviour.** "The handler retries three times" not "The handler
  will retry three times".
- **Reserve `will` for the actual future.** "The build fails if the secret is missing" describes
  a property; "The build will fail when we update X next quarter" describes a future event.
- **Avoid `currently`.** It dates the sentence the moment it is written. Either give a version
  or drop it.

❌ **INCORRECT:**

```markdown
We recommend that you should set replicas to 3.
Currently the validator will support YAML.
```

✅ **CORRECT:**

```markdown
Set replicas to 3.
The validator supports YAML.
```

**Scope:** Applies to **new and modified content only**.

**Why:** Second person and BLUF cut reading time. Present tense names the system's behaviour as
observable now; future tense describes change events. Mixing them confuses readers.

---

### Hedging

**One hedge per sentence at most. State the rule, then add a caveat only when a real one
exists.**

Avoid weasel words like `can`, `may`, `should` when clarity matters. "X happens" is stronger
than "X may happen" when X always happens.

❌ **INCORRECT:**

```markdown
It may possibly sometimes fail under unusual conditions.
```

✅ **CORRECT:**

```markdown
It fails when the input exceeds 256 MB.
```

**Scope:** Applies to **new and modified content only**.

**Why:** Stacked hedges make rules sound suggestive when they are mandatory. Readers cannot tell
from "may possibly sometimes" whether an action is required, optional, or unreliable.

---

### Avoid AI tells

**Documentation is written for humans, not stylized like AI output.**

Common AI tells to avoid:

- Em dashes (`—`) and en dashes (`–`). See [Dashes](#dashes).
- Semicolons. See [Semicolons](#semicolons).
- Filler intensifiers: `simply`, `just`, `easily`, `truly`, `incredibly`, `seamlessly`,
  `robust`, `comprehensive`, `cutting-edge`, `leverage`, `delve`, `tapestry`, `landscape`.
- `Not only X, but also Y` and `Not just X, but Y` patterns.
- Empty closings: `In conclusion`, `To summarize`, `As we've seen`.
- Vague attributions: `widely regarded as`, `has been described as`, `experts agree`. Cite a
  source or delete the claim.
- Tail `-ing` significance clauses: `...enabling teams to deliver value at scale`. The phrase
  almost never carries information. Cut it.
- Rigid section scaffolding lifted onto a technical page: `Introduction / Challenges / Future
  Prospects`. Use the section headings the content actually needs.
- Bullet lists where every item starts with a bold inline header plus colon used to format
  ordinary prose. Fine for genuine term-definition pairs; an AI tell when applied to all
  bullets by default.

**Scope:** Applies to **new and modified content only**.

**Why:** AI-generated text leans on these patterns heavily. Their absence makes documentation
feel more direct and trustworthy. Read sentences aloud. If it sounds like a press release or a
chatbot, rewrite.

---

## Markdown formatting

### Lists

**CRITICAL: All lists (bullet or numbered) MUST have empty lines before and after them.**

❌ **INCORRECT (no empty lines):**

```markdown
Template-level parameters are defined in two ways:
- Directly on the object
- Via ParameterSets
When you need environment-specific values...
```

✅ **CORRECT (with empty lines):**

```markdown
Template-level parameters are defined in two ways:

- Directly on the object
- Via ParameterSets

When you need environment-specific values...
```

**Why:** Markdown linters require empty lines around lists for proper parsing and rendering.

### Table of Contents

**CRITICAL: Documents with 10+ headings MUST include a Table of Contents after the main title.**

**When to add ToC:**

- Documents with **3 or more headings** (`#`, `##`, `###`, etc.)
- Place ToC immediately after the main document title (H1)
- ToC is a plain list WITHOUT a heading (no `## Table of Contents`)
- Description/overview section comes AFTER the ToC

**Format:**

```markdown
# Document Title

- [Section 1](#section-1)
  - [Subsection 1.1](#subsection-11)
  - [Subsection 1.2](#subsection-12)
- [Section 2](#section-2)
  - [Subsection 2.1](#subsection-21)

## Description

Brief description or overview...

## Section 1

Content...
```

**Examples from repository:**

✅ `docs/how-to/credential-encryption.md` (17 headings, has ToC)
✅ `docs/features/env-inventory-generation.md` (many headings, has ToC)

**Link format:**

- Use GitHub-style anchor links: `#section-name`
- Convert to lowercase, replace spaces with hyphens
- Remove special characters
- Example: `### Step 1: Install Tools` → `#step-1-install-tools`

### Line length

**CRITICAL: Wrap prose lines at 120 characters maximum.**

**Scope:**

- Applies to prose paragraphs and list items in any Markdown file.
- **Excluded:** tables, fenced code blocks, URLs, and image references.
- **New or rewritten content only.** When editing an existing document, wrap paragraphs you add or rewrite at 120
  chars. Do NOT reflow surrounding existing prose to match - that produces large, noisy diffs unrelated to the
  task.

**How to wrap:**

- Break at natural sentence or clause boundaries (after a period or comma, or before a conjunction).
- Indent continuation lines of list items so they align with the first non-bullet character (3 spaces for `-`
  bullets, 3 spaces for `1.` numbered lists).
- Keep an empty line before and after each paragraph (already required by the Lists rule above).

❌ **DON'T (hard wrap mid-word):**

```markdown
The Effective Set calculator emits well-known deploy parameter names for selected built-in cred
ential references.
```

✅ **DO (break at sentence or clause boundary):**

```markdown
The Effective Set calculator emits well-known deploy parameter names for selected built-in
credential references.
```

**Why:** 120 characters keeps Markdown source readable in side-by-side diffs and code reviews without horizontal
scrolling. Capping the rule to new content avoids whitespace-only churn in legacy files.

---

### Callouts (Notes, Warnings, Tips)

**CRITICAL: Always use GitHub-flavored Markdown native callout syntax, not bold-text workarounds.**

Available types: `NOTE`, `TIP`, `IMPORTANT`, `WARNING`, `CAUTION`.

❌ **INCORRECT:**

```markdown
> **Note:** EnvGene also supports dot-notation keys.

> **Warning:** This will overwrite existing values.
```

✅ **CORRECT:**

```markdown
> [!NOTE]
> EnvGene also supports dot-notation keys.

> [!WARNING]
> This will overwrite existing values.

> [!TIP]
> Use cluster-wide scope to avoid repetition across environments.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `name` field must exactly match the filename without the extension.

> [!CAUTION]
> Setting `mergeEnvSpecificResourceProfiles: false` replaces the template override entirely.
```

**Why:** Native callouts render with icons and colour highlighting on GitHub and other renderers.
Bold-text variants are plain blockquotes.

---

### Heading numbering

**Do not number headings unless they enumerate alternative workflows.**

Visual hierarchy (`#` → `##` → `###`) and the document's table of contents already convey
structure. Adding numeric prefixes (`## 1. Overview`, `### 2.1 Step one`) duplicates that
information and creates fragile cross-references that break when sections are added or
reordered.

❌ **INCORRECT** (sequential topics in a feature document):

```markdown
## 1. Passport file
## 2. Resolution
## 3. Merge into cloud.yml
## 4. Parameter traceability
```

✅ **CORRECT** (same content, no numbering):

```markdown
## Passport file
## Resolution
## Merge into cloud.yml
## Parameter traceability
```

✅ **ACCEPTABLE** (alternative workflows, where numbering enumerates choices):

```markdown
## 1. Creating a cluster without a Cloud Passport
## 2. Creating a cluster with a manually assembled Cloud Passport
## 3. Creating a cluster using Cloud Passport Discovery
```

**Scope:** Applies to **new and modified content only**. Existing numbered headings are not
affected by this rule unless the surrounding lines are being edited for other reasons.

**Why:** Numbered headings duplicate the structure already shown by heading level and the TOC.
They make in-text references (`see section 3.2`) fragile under reorganization, and they are not
the convention in this repository (only 2 of ~36 docs use numbering, and only for enumerated
alternative workflows). Modern dev-doc style guides (Google, Microsoft, Mozilla, GitHub Docs)
do not number headings in user-facing documentation.

---

### Tables

**CRITICAL: All Markdown tables MUST have vertically aligned pipe characters (`|`).**

#### ❌ Incorrect format

```markdown
| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
|----------|-------|----------|
| Short | Value | Data |
| Very long value here | Val | D |
```

**Problem:** Pipes are not aligned, causing Markdown linting warnings and poor readability.

#### ✅ Correct format

```markdown
| Column 1             | Column 2 | Column 3 |
|----------------------|----------|----------|
| Short                | Value    | Data     |
| Very long value here | Val      | D        |
```

**Requirements:**

1. All `|` characters in header row, separator row, and data rows MUST be vertically aligned
2. Add padding spaces to ensure proper column alignment
3. Each column should have consistent width across all rows
4. Separator row (`---`) should match the width of the widest content in that column

**How to achieve alignment:**

1. **Keep cell content concise** - Long text makes alignment difficult
2. **Simplify when possible** - Remove examples from cells if they make text too long
3. **Uniform width per column** - Each cell in a column should have the same width (add trailing spaces)
4. **Don't add spaces endlessly** - If alignment fails repeatedly, the problem is content length, not spacing

#### Common mistake

❌ **DON'T: Try to align long, varying content with spaces**

```markdown
| Location                                                        | Use When                                  |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `/environments/<cluster>/<env>/Inventory/resource_profiles/`   | One environment only (e.g., prod-env-01)  |
| `/environments/<cluster>/resource_profiles/`                   | All environments in cluster (e.g., prod-*)|
| `/environments/resource_profiles/`                             | Multiple clusters (e.g., all production)  |
```

**Problem:** Different content lengths in "Use When" column → pipes will never align no matter how many spaces you add.

✅ **DO: Simplify content first, then align**

```markdown
| Location                                                     | Use When             |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| `/environments/<cluster>/<env>/Inventory/resource_profiles/` | One environment only |
| `/environments/<cluster>/resource_profiles/`                 | All environments     |
| `/environments/resource_profiles/`                           | Global               |
```

**Solution:** Shortened "Use When" text → pipes naturally align because each cell in the column has the same width.

#### Real example from repository

```markdown
| Location                                              | Scope                | Use When                        |
|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------|
| `/environments/<cluster>/<env>/Inventory/parameters/` | Environment-specific | One environment only            |
| `/environments/<cluster>/parameters/`                 | Cluster-wide         | All environments in cluster     |
| `/environments/parameters/`                           | Global               | Multiple clusters               |
```

#### Delimiter row style

The delimiter row uses `|---|` form - no spaces between `|` and `-`. Dashes are padded to match
column width for vertical alignment.

❌ **INCORRECT:**

```markdown
| Field    | Required |
| -------- | -------- |
| `name`   | yes      |
```

✅ **CORRECT:**

```markdown
| Field    | Required |
|----------|----------|
| `name`   | yes      |
```

---

### Link text

**Link text names the destination. Do not use `click here` or `this page`.**

❌ **INCORRECT:**

```markdown
For setup steps, [click here](/docs/how-to/setup.md).
The schema reference is available [here](/schemas/credential.schema.json).
```

✅ **CORRECT:**

```markdown
For setup steps, see the [setup how-to](/docs/how-to/setup.md).
The [credential schema](/schemas/credential.schema.json) lists the required fields.
```

**Scope:** Applies to **new and modified content only**.

**Why:** Link text is read out of context by screen readers, search engines, and readers who
scan. `Click here` carries no information when extracted. A destination-naming link tells the
reader where they will land.

---

### Documentation file naming

- Use kebab-case: `override-template-parameters.md`
- Be descriptive: `billing-prod-deploy.yml` not `override.yml`

---

## Doc voice and structure

### Section adds only what it uniquely contributes

A documentation section should add only the information specific to the concept it introduces.
Cross-cutting facts - schemas, notations, rules, examples of canonical types - are cross-linked to
their canonical location, not restated.

❌ **INCORRECT:**

- Re-describing the full schema of an object that already has its own section.
- Repeating notation rules in every section that uses the notation.
- Re-deriving constraints already stated in upstream sections.

✅ **CORRECT:**

- Link to the canonical definition for the concept.
- Add only the new facts unique to the current section.

**Scope:** Applies to **new and modified content only**.

**Why:** Restated information ages out of sync with the canonical copy. Readers wonder which copy is
authoritative. Lengthens reviews without adding value.

---

### Section value audit

**During refactors and final reviews, ask of each section: what unique fact does it carry? If most content
is restated from elsewhere, drop or trim.**

Checklist for each section:

1. Name the load-bearing fact (unique observable, rule, or definition).
2. Check where else it is said (catalog, table, sibling sections, parent section).
3. If the unique fact is small (one sentence), fold into a neighbouring section.
4. If everything is derivable from elsewhere, drop the section. Cross-link from the catalog if an explicit
   pointer is needed.

❌ **INCORRECT** (section earns no keep):

A subsection that rehashes the catalog table and restates a dispatching rule already implied by sibling
sections covering each context.

✅ **CORRECT** (drop the section):

The dispatching rule is derivable from sibling sections. Drop the subsection. Cross-link from the catalog
table only if an explicit pointer is needed.

**Scope:** Applies to **new and modified content only**.

**Why:** Sections without unique content fragment the doc and add maintenance burden. Restated content drifts
from its canonical source. Apply this audit during refactors, not only when first writing a section, because
content accumulates restated facts as the doc evolves.

---

### Don't silently extend the spec

If a section would read more cleanly under a hypothetical spec extension - a wider enum, a new
notation, a relaxed constraint - do not apply the extension in the draft. File the proposed extension
as an open question and write the section against the current spec.

❌ **INCORRECT:**

- Drafting a section that implies a notation works in a wider scope than the spec currently allows.
- Adding examples that assume a constraint has been relaxed.

✅ **CORRECT:**

- Write to the current spec, accepting any awkwardness in the section.
- File the proposed extension as an open question, separately.

**Scope:** Applies to **new and modified content only**.

**Why:** Spec changes propagate to validation rules, schemas, tooling, and migration. They deserve
explicit decisions, not implicit drafting assumptions.

---

### Observable behaviour over implementation detail

Documentation works best when it foregrounds observable behaviour - what users, downstream tools, or
consuming systems can rely on. Internal mechanism - phases, ordering of components, runtime fallback
paths - is worth including when it is part of what readers depend on. Otherwise the observable outcome
often communicates more clearly.

A useful self-check: would a reasonable alternative implementation that produces the same outcome
invalidate this paragraph? If yes, the mechanism is load-bearing - keep it. If no, the observable
outcome alone may carry the message.

❌ **INCORRECT** (when mechanism is not load-bearing):

- Describing the sequence of internal components (step 1: X reads file. Step 2: Y exports value).
- Naming runtime phases that have no user-visible meaning.

✅ **CORRECT:**

- Stating the observable outcome (the value is available to downstream consumer Y).
- Documenting mechanism only when it is part of the commitment (timing, atomicity, ordering).

**Scope:** Applies to **new and modified content only**.

**Why:** Implementation choices evolve faster than the observables they deliver. Documenting mechanism
that is not load-bearing forces stale doc updates with every implementation change.

---

### Avoid duplication in description

**Don't repeat the same information multiple times in the Description section.**

#### ❌ Incorrect (duplicated info)

```markdown
## Description

Parameters are defined two ways:
- Inline
- Via ParameterSets

Template-level parameters are defined two ways:  <!-- DUPLICATE -->
- Inline
- Via ParameterSets
```

#### ✅ Correct (concise, mentioned once)

```markdown
## Description

This guide shows how to override template-level parameters.

Template-level parameters are defined in two ways:
- Inline
- Via ParameterSets

[Rest of description...]
```

---

### Declarative tone (reference docs)

**Reference documentation describes the system as it is. Do not describe transitions, before/after diffs,
or mark elements as "new".**

Feature specifications and object schemas live in the Diátaxis Reference quadrant. Implementation history
(what changed, what was added, what was deprecated) belongs in tickets, PR descriptions, and commit
messages, not in the reference docs themselves.

❌ **INCORRECT** (transitional, history-laden):

```markdown
The existing Credential is extended by introducing a new type `external`...

| Section                     | ...
| `docker_registry` (**new**) | ...

For local Credentials the **existing** macro is used, **unchanged from today**.

# AS IS Credential          # TO BE Credential
```

✅ **CORRECT** (state-only, declarative):

```markdown
A Credential of `type: external` describes...

| Section            | ...
| `docker_registry`  | ...

For local Credentials the `envgen.creds.get(...)` macro is used.

# Local Credential          # External Credential
```

**Exception:** Migration documents and changelogs are explicitly about transitions. They describe how to
move from state X to state Y and are not subject to this rule.

**Scope:** Applies to **new and modified content only**.

**Why:** Reference docs are looked up to learn what something IS. Mixed transitional content makes the spec
brittle - phrases like "new" or "AS IS" age poorly as the system evolves, and force readers to mentally
filter what is current vs what is historical.

---

### Tables: one fact per row

In documentation tables, each row carries one identifier or entity. Composite cells listing multiple
alternatives separated by punctuation are split into separate rows. Column names describe properties
the document already defines, not invented labels.

❌ **INCORRECT:**

- Packing alternative values into one cell separated by "or" or commas.
- Adding a column labelled in vocabulary the document has not introduced elsewhere.
- Composite cells listing multiple identifiers when each could be its own row.

✅ **CORRECT:**

- One identifier per row.
- Column labels reuse the document's existing vocabulary.
- Alternatives appear as separate rows or in prose below the table.

**Scope:** Applies to **new and modified content only**.

**Why:** Tables in documentation are dense lookups. Composite cells and free-text columns reduce their
lookup value.

---

### Validation rule sections

**When documenting semantic validation rules in a feature spec, group them by phase, state invariants
declaratively, and factor out shared failure behaviour into a single note.**

A validation section catalogs semantic checks the system applies on top of schema validation. The pattern:

1. **Open with a note that establishes shared context** - what schema validation already covers, the
   default failure behaviour (fail vs warn), and the error-message contract. Do not repeat these in
   each rule.
2. **Group rules by phase** - each phase (a generation stage, an import operation, a runtime check)
   gets its own subsection.
3. **State invariants, not actions** - write what must be true. The reader infers the negative case.
4. **Name each rule** with a short bold noun-phrase followed by a period, then the explanation.
5. **Mark exceptions inline** - non-failure cases (warnings, deferred checks) are noted in the rule
   name itself.
6. **Cross-link, do not restate** - reference the canonical object definitions and field semantics
   rather than duplicating them.

❌ **INCORRECT:**

- Describing the validator's actions ("The validator iterates over...", "The check runs after...")
  instead of the invariant.
- Repeating "If this fails, generation stops with an error" in every rule.
- Listing field constraints already documented in the object schema.
- Mixing rules across phases in one undifferentiated list.

✅ **CORRECT:**

- "Every X of type Y has a Z field referencing a known W." (invariant form)
- A single note block at the top of the section describing the default failure behaviour and the
  error-message contract.
- Cross-link to the object definition for field semantics.
- Subsections per phase ("During X generation", "During Y import").

**Scope:** Applies to **new and modified content only**.

**Why:** Declarative invariants are easier to scan and harder to misinterpret than procedural
descriptions of validator behaviour. Phase grouping helps readers locate rules relevant to the
operation they care about. Shared failure semantics factored out reduces noise and prevents
inconsistencies between rules.

---

## Object Examples in Documentation

### Source of truth for object schemas

**CRITICAL: Never invent object structures. Always derive examples from authoritative sources.**

The two authoritative sources are:

- **`docs/envgene-objects.md`** - human-readable descriptions, field explanations, and canonical examples for all EnvGene objects
- **`schemas/`** - JSON Schema files that define required fields, allowed values, and types

#### Rules

1. **Before writing any YAML/JSON example** for an EnvGene object, read the corresponding entry in `docs/envgene-objects.md` AND the matching schema file under `schemas/`.
2. **Validate every example against the schema**: all fields marked `"required"` in the schema
   must be present. No fields may be included that do not exist in the schema (unless
   `additionalProperties: true`).
3. **Do not guess**: if an object is not described in `docs/envgene-objects.md` and has no schema file, write explicitly:

   > No schema or description found for this object in `docs/envgene-objects.md` or `schemas/`. Cannot provide a validated example.

4. **Do not add fictional fields** such as `type:` or `applications:` to objects that have no such fields in their schema.
5. **Use real field names**: cross-check field names and allowed enum values against the schema. Do not invent field names based on intuition.

#### How much of the object to show

In tutorials and how-to guides, show only the **relevant part** of the object, not the full structure. Use `# ...` comments to signal omitted fields so the reader knows the snippet is intentionally incomplete.

- **Reference docs** → show the full object.
- **Tutorials / how-to guides** → show only the fields being explained. Collapse the rest with `# ...`.

This keeps examples focused on the concept being taught and avoids becoming outdated when unrelated fields change.

#### ❌ Incorrect - invented fields and unnecessary noise

```yaml
# Namespace template - WRONG: invented fields, full object shown in tutorial context
name: "{{ current_env.name }}-bss"
type: namespace          # does not exist in namespace.schema.json
applications:            # does not exist in namespace.schema.json
  - name: "Cloud-BSS"
credentialsId: ""
isServerSideMerge: false
cleanInstallApprovalRequired: false
mergeDeployParametersAndE2EParameters: false
deployParameterSets:
  - "bss"
```

#### ✅ Correct - focused snippet, validated field names, omissions annotated

```yaml
# Namespace template - only the relevant section is shown
---
name: "{{ current_env.environmentName }}-bss"
# ... other required fields (see schemas/namespace.schema.json) ...
profile:
  name: dev-bss-override
  baseline: dev
# ... deployParameterSets, e2eParameters, etc. ...
```

---

## Sample files in `docs/samples/`

Sample file sets under `docs/samples/` are copyable template-repository and instance-repository files.
This section covers the files. Inline YAML snippets inside docs are covered by
[Object Examples in Documentation](#object-examples-in-documentation).

**Scope:** All rules in this section apply to **new and modified samples only**. Changing a file in an
existing set re-triggers the file-level rules (generation-ready checks, placeholder values) for the
changed files only. Folder-level items (subfolder names, index entries) apply only when you create or
restructure the folder. Existing sample sets are not affected until touched.

---

### Samples are mandatory

**A how-to guide whose steps involve authoring or editing repository files, or a feature doc that
introduces user-facing configuration, ships with working sample files in the same PR. Prose and inline
snippets alone are not enough.**

Link existing samples when they already cover the scenario: the linked set holds the files and the states
that the guide's steps use. Add new ones otherwise. User-facing configuration means files or fields that
users author in template or instance repositories.

❌ **INCORRECT:**

- A how-to guide that describes configuration structure only in prose and inline snippets.
- A feature doc that introduces a new user-facing configuration file with no copyable sample.

✅ **CORRECT:**

- A how-to guide plus `docs/samples/<feature>/` holding the files it references, cross-linked both ways.
- A how-to guide that links samples already present under `docs/samples/`.

**Scope:** Applies to **new how-to guides, new feature docs, and new sections that introduce
configuration only**.

**Why:** Samples are executable documentation. They surface defects prose hides - invalid fields, name
mismatches, unresolvable references - and give the reader a verified starting point.

---

### Feature-scoped sample folders

**Samples for one feature live in one folder, `docs/samples/<feature>/`, with the template-repository and
instance-repository parts side by side.**

Name the folder after the feature, matching the `docs/features/` doc name where one exists.

```text
docs/samples/<feature>/
├── template-repository/    # Template repository files
└── instance-repository/    # Instance repository files
```

- Create only the subfolders that have content.
- Inside the two subfolders, mirror the real repository paths
  (`template-repository/templates/env_templates/...`, `instance-repository/environments/...`). For
  path segments the reader renames, use concrete instance names in the style of the existing samples
  (`cluster-01`, `env-01`) - not angle-bracket tokens, and not bare contract-looking segments
  (`cluster`, `env`) that read as mandatory path elements.
- Express variants of one file as separate sample instances, never as suffixed filenames. Alternative
  inventories become separate environment folders (`env-01/`, `env-02/`), each holding a real
  `env_definition.yml`. Annotate what each variant shows in the sample itself (for the
  inventories, the `description` field).
- The folder holds every feature-specific state the guide references. A state identical to a
  generic-tree baseline, or to a file homed in another feature folder, is linked instead of copied. A
  state that differs is a separate sample instance.
- The folder has no readme. Usage steps and target paths live in the guide that references the
  samples.
- Add the folder to the Examples & Samples section of both index readmes (see
  [Doc index updates](#doc-index-updates)) and add a short section for it to the samples hub readme
  `/docs/samples/README.md`.
- The generic layout trees (`template-repository/`, `instance-repository/`) stay minimal baselines and
  do not accumulate feature samples.

**Why:** A reader following a guide needs the full set in one place, including variants a single
canonical tree cannot express. Mirrored paths and shared subfolder names keep the set readable in the
vocabulary the repository already uses.

---

### One sample, one home

**A sample artifact lives in exactly one place under `docs/samples/` - not copied between a feature
folder and the generic layout trees, between two feature folders, or within one folder.**

Files that genuinely differ are variants, not copies. When a feature folder becomes the home of a
sample, delete the copy elsewhere and update links.

**Why:** Duplicated samples drift apart, and readers cannot tell which copy is authoritative.

---

### Samples are generation-ready

**A sample set works when copied as instructed. The checks below define acceptance: filenames, object
names, and cross-references satisfy the resolution rules of the code.**

No CI job validates sample files against the schemas. Run the checks manually.

Before you declare a sample set done:

1. Validate every file against its JSON Schema in `schemas/`, as
   [Object Examples in Documentation](#object-examples-in-documentation) prescribes for snippets.
   Field types matter: `[]` and `{}` are not interchangeable. A schema pass is necessary, not
   sufficient - the schemas allow additional properties, so also check field names against the object
   reference. For `.j2` files, check the rendered shape against the target schema.
2. Check names the code resolves by convention: the template descriptor filename equals
   `envTemplate.name`, BG Domain namespace names equal `template_override.name` values, and so on.
   Confirm each convention in the code (see [Verify, don't fabricate](#verify-dont-fabricate)).
3. Exclude system-generated fields (for example `generatedVersions`) from files the reader copies.
4. Exclude references to resources the sample set does not provide (for example a `cloudPassport`
   name without a passport file), or state where they come from in the referencing guide or in a
   comment inside the sample file.

**Why:** A sample that fails generation is worse than no sample. The reader assumes their own mistake
and loses time debugging shipped configuration.

---

### Placeholder values

**Sample values are obviously fake and self-describing. Never use realistic-looking secrets.**

- Secret values: self-describing placeholders such as `dbaas-password` or `token-placeholder-123`, or
  Credentials of `type: external`. No opaque strings that could pass for real tokens. Credential IDs
  (`bgdomain-cred`) are names, not secret values - normal naming rules apply.
- Hosts and URLs: reserved example domains (`example.com`, `k8s.example.local`).
- Substitution slots: angle-bracket tokens following the vocabulary of the samples hub readme
  (`<cluster-name>`, `<environment-name>`, `<paramset>`).

**Why:** A realistic-looking secret in a sample trains readers to paste real ones and trips secret
scanners. Self-describing placeholders show which value goes where without a legend.

---

## Use case design

Use cases (UCs) live in `/docs/use-cases/`. They describe observable system behaviour in a
structured format (Pre-requisites, Trigger, Steps, Results) and serve both as documentation and
as test-design input.

**Scope:** All rules in this section apply to **new and modified UCs only**. Existing UCs that
violate these rules are not affected and do not need rewriting unless the surrounding lines are
being edited for other reasons.

**Rationale:**

- **Equivalence Class Partitioning** is the standard test-design technique (ISTQB) and aligns
  with BDD Scenario Outlines and modern API documentation style (Stripe, GitHub, Google API
  Design Guide).
- Matrix decomposition (UC per combination of variables) creates combinatorial bloat where
  most UCs are clones differing in one word.
- Implementation-detail leaks bind documentation to a specific code shape. Abstraction
  decouples docs from implementation churn.

### Apply equivalence class partitioning

**Do not enumerate variants of an identical-behavior UC. Merge them into a single parameterized
UC.**

When two or more candidate UCs would describe the same observable behavior with only a parameter
difference (e.g., job name, trigger flag, environment kind), they belong to the same equivalence
class. They must be merged into a single UC with the variable parameterized via the Trigger
section.

❌ **INCORRECT (enumerated variants):**

```markdown
### UC-X-1: Validation fails at `generate_effective_set`
...

### UC-X-2: Validation fails at `cmdb_import`
...
```

Two UCs that differ only in job name. Both invoke the same validator and produce the same error
message format. This is one equivalence class, not two.

✅ **CORRECT (parameterized trigger):**

```markdown
### UC-X-1: Validation fails

**Trigger:**

> [!NOTE]
> One of the following conditions must be met:

1. Instance pipeline is started with `GENERATE_EFFECTIVE_SET: true`
2. Instance pipeline is started with `CMDB_IMPORT: true`
```

### When to split UCs

Split into separate UCs only when behavior differs in an observable way:

- Different validators or handlers (e.g., parameter validator vs credential validator).
- Different error message format or different output structure.
- Different post-conditions or side effects.

### When to merge UCs

Merge into a single parameterized UC when:

- Same observable behavior.
- Same error message format.
- Same outcome.
- Differences are limited to parameter values (job name, flag values, environment names).

### Abstract steps over implementation mechanics

Steps describe what happens, not how it is implemented. Avoid `Reads X`, `Iterates Y`,
`Detects Z` phrasing - it leaks implementation that the documentation cannot guarantee will
match.

❌ **INCORRECT:**

```markdown
**Steps:**

1. The `generate_effective_set` job runs in the pipeline:
    1. Reads the existing Cloud and Namespace YAMLs from the Environment Instance.
    2. Iterates over `deployParameters`, `e2eParameters`, and ...
    3. Detects a value equal to `envgeneNullValue`.
    4. Aborts with a validation error.
```

✅ **CORRECT:**

```markdown
**Steps:**

1. The `generate_effective_set` job runs.
2. Parameter validation detects an unresolved `envgeneNullValue`.
3. The job aborts with a validation error.
```

### Results: observable outcomes only

Document what the operator observes, not downstream consequences that the documented component
does not control.

❌ **INCORRECT:**

```markdown
**Results:**

1. The job fails with the message: ...
2. No Effective Set is produced.
3. Deployment is blocked.
```

`Deployment is blocked` assumes authority over deployment that the documented component does
not have.

✅ **CORRECT:**

```markdown
**Results:**

1. The job fails with the message: ...
```

---

## Commits and pull requests

### Commit messages

Use Conventional Commits format: `<type>: <description>`. Types in use here: `feat`, `fix`,
`docs`, `chore`, `refactor`, `test`, `ci`, `perf`, `style`. The repository convention is no
scope prefix.

Subject line:

- Imperative mood (`Add X`, not `Added X` or `Adds X`).
- Under 72 characters.
- No trailing period.

Body (when needed):

- Empty line before body.
- Explain WHY the change is needed and trade-offs, not WHAT (the diff already shows what).
- Wrap at 72 characters.
- Reference issues in a footer (`Closes #123`, `Refs #456`).

### Commit type for docs-only changes

If a commit touches only documentation files (`*.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, files under `docs/`), use
`docs:` as the commit type. The post-merge build workflow skips Docker image rebuilds for commit types
other than `feat:`, `fix:`, and `BREAKING CHANGE`. A doc-only change marked `feat:` or `fix:` triggers
unnecessary image builds.

Tests and linters run on every PR regardless of commit type.

### Pull request description for docs-only changes

Documentation PRs omit the "Test plan" section by default. The doc-quality gates (super-linter,
textlint, link-checker, markdownlint) cover correctness. Include a Test plan section only when
explicitly requested or when the change has runtime implications beyond text.

### Commit granularity

**One logical change per commit.** A commit should be a single coherent unit that a reviewer
can read in one pass.

Split into separate commits when:

- A rule, convention, or schema is added (AGENTS.md, lint config) along with content that
  follows it - put the rule change in its own commit so the rule can be reviewed separately
  from its application.
- Mechanical changes (mass rename, formatting sweep) are mixed with semantic changes - put
  the mechanical change in its own commit so the semantic diff is readable.
- A pre-existing issue is fixed in passing - put the fix in its own commit so it can be
  backported or reverted independently.

Keep in the same commit:

- Test with the code or doc it covers.
- Migration script with the schema change that requires it.
- Anchor renames with the heading change that triggered them.

### Pull request scope

**One focused goal per PR.**

- PR description states the problem, the decision, and trade-offs.
- Target size: under 500 lines of changed prose for docs PRs, under 400 lines for code PRs.
  Larger changes belong in a stack of dependent PRs (mention the order in each description).
- Refactor PRs go separately from feature PRs. Rule additions go separately from
  rule-application PRs.
- Do not include unrelated cleanup. File a follow-up issue instead.

### Doc index updates

**Add new docs to (and remove deleted docs from) the index readmes.**

The repository has two parallel index readmes that mirror the same structure:

- `/README.md` (root project readme, "Documentation" section)
- `/docs/README.md` (docs hub readme)

When you add a tutorial, how-to, feature, or migration doc, add a link in both readmes under
the matching section. When you rename or remove a doc, update both readmes to keep links live.
Match the description style of sibling entries (short, verb-leading phrase, same capitalization
convention).

Per-directory readmes (`/docs/features/README.md`, `/docs/use-cases/README.md`, etc.) are
meta-docs that explain what kind of content the directory holds. They are not navigation
indices and do not need a per-doc entry.

**Why:** GitHub's link-checker catches dead links but does not warn when a new doc is missing
from the index. Readers discover docs through the index readmes, not by browsing directories.

### Heading renames and cross-links

When renaming a Markdown heading, the GitHub-generated anchor (`#section-name`) also changes.
Cross-links in other files that point to the old anchor become broken (CI link-checker fails).

**Before pushing after a heading rename:**

1. Grep the repository for references to the OLD anchor:

   ```bash
   grep -rnE "#old-anchor-name" --include='*.md' .
   ```

2. Update each matching cross-link to the NEW anchor in all affected files.

3. Update the link text in `[text](#anchor)` to match the new heading text where appropriate.

For a broader audit of all cross-links in the repository:

```bash
grep -rhoE '\]\([^)]+#[^)]+\)' --include='*.md' . | sort -u
```

**Why:** A heading rename inside one file silently breaks references in unrelated files. The
CI link-checker (lychee) catches this only after push.

### Pre-flight linter checks

Before declaring documentation changes done, run the same linters that CI will run.

**Markdown structure (`markdownlint`):**

```bash
npx --yes markdownlint-cli@latest --config .github/linters/.markdown-lint.yml <changed-files>
```

The project config (`.github/linters/.markdown-lint.yml`) relaxes `MD013` line length to 1000,
and disables `MD012`, `MD033`, `MD051`. Running markdownlint without `--config` uses the
default settings (line length 80) which produces many false positives unrelated to the project
rules and may hide real issues like `MD009` (trailing spaces) or `MD040` (fenced block missing
language).

**Natural-language terminology (`textlint` with `textlint-rule-terminology`):**

CI runs textlint on prose to flag terminology preferences (for example, em dashes should be
hyphens, `repo` should be `repository`, `READMEs` should be `readmes`, `Blank line` should be
`Empty line`). The textlint config lives in the shared `netcracker/.github` repository and is
pulled in at CI time; there is no local config file to reference. To preview locally:

```bash
npx --yes textlint --rule terminology <changed-files>
```

This runs the default terminology rule set. CI may flag a few additional terms layered on top
by the shared config. Treat the CI report as authoritative.

**Why:** The CI super-linter runs both linters. Running locally gives a true preview of the CI
result, catches real issues, and avoids distraction from false positives that arise when
running linters with default (non-project) settings.

### Testing documentation changes

Before committing documentation:

1. Check Markdown syntax
2. Verify all links work
3. Ensure tables are aligned
4. Review for clarity and accuracy

### Change requests

A change request (CR) is the implementation-phase issue. It hands a settled design to a
developer for implementation, not for design discussion or investigation. CRs follow a
six-section structure. For the body template, the convention, and good and bad examples, see
[docs/dev/creating-cr.md](/docs/dev/creating-cr.md).
