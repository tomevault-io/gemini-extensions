**Game creation directory**: When the `/make-game` pipeline is launched from within the `game-creator` repository (i.e., the current working directory is `game-creator/` or a subdirectory), new games **must be created in `examples/`** (e.g., `examples/<game-name>/`). This keeps the repo organized and ensures example games are versioned alongside the plugin. When launched from any other directory, games are created in the current working directory as normal.

## Architecture Rules

All games built with this plugin follow these mandatory patterns:

1. **EventBus singleton** — All cross-module communication via pub/sub. Modules never import each other directly. Events use `domain:action` naming (e.g., `bird:flap`, `game:over`).

2. **GameState singleton** — Single centralized state object. Systems read from it. Events trigger mutations. Has `reset()` for clean restarts.

3. **Constants.js** — Every magic number, color, timing, speed, and config value. Zero hardcoded values in game logic.

4. **Orchestrator** — One entry point (Game.js or GameConfig.js) initializes all systems and manages the game lifecycle.

5. **Directory structure** — `core/` (EventBus, GameState, Constants), `scenes/` or `systems/`, `entities/`, `ui/`, `audio/`.

6. **`render_game_to_text()`** — Every game exposes `window.render_game_to_text()` in `main.js`. Returns a concise JSON string of the current game state for AI agents to read without interpreting pixels. Must include: coordinate system note, game mode (`playing`/`game_over`), score, player position/velocity, and visible entities. Keep it succinct — only current, on-screen state. Games boot directly into gameplay (no title screen by default), so `playing` is the initial mode.

7. **`advanceTime(ms)`** — Every game exposes `window.advanceTime(ms)` in `main.js`. Returns a Promise that resolves after `ms` milliseconds of real time, allowing test scripts to advance the game in controlled increments. For frame-precise control in `@playwright/test`, prefer `page.clock.install()` + `runFor()`.

8. **`progress.md`** — Created at the project root by the game-creator agent. Records the original user prompt, TODOs, decisions, gotchas, and loose ends after each pipeline step. Enables multi-session continuity and agent handoff.

## Example Game: Flappy Bird

Located at `examples/flappy-bird/`. Demonstrates all patterns.

### Key files

- `src/main.js` — Entry point. Inits audio bridge, creates Phaser game, exposes test globals.
- `src/core/EventBus.js` — 13 events across bird, score, game, particles, and audio domains.
- `src/core/Constants.js` — All config: game dimensions, bird physics, pipe settings, colors, particles, transitions.
- `src/core/GameState.js` — score, bestScore, started, gameOver.
- `src/scenes/GameScene.js` — Main gameplay. Two-stage start (GET READY → playing). AABB collision. Death slow-mo.
- `src/scenes/UIScene.js` — Parallel overlay scene for HUD score display.
- `src/audio/AudioManager.js` — AudioContext init, master gain, BGM sequencer play/stop.
- `src/audio/music.js` — Three BGM patterns: menu (100 cpm), gameplay (130 cpm), game over (60 cpm).
- `src/audio/sfx.js` — Four SFX: flap, score, death, button click.

### Running

```bash
cd examples/flappy-bird
npm install
npm run dev          # Vite dev server on port 3000
npm run test         # 15 Playwright tests
npm run build        # Production build to dist/
```

### Test structure

```
tests/
  fixtures/game-test.js      # Custom fixture: waits for boot, provides startPlaying()
  helpers/seed-random.js     # Mulberry32 seeded PRNG for deterministic tests
  e2e/game.spec.js           # 10 tests: boot, scenes, input, scoring, restart
  e2e/visual.spec.js         # 2 tests: initial gameplay + game over screenshots (3000px tolerance)
  e2e/perf.spec.js           # 3 tests: load time, FPS, canvas dimensions
```

### Audio integration

Audio requires user interaction to start (browser autoplay policy). The flow:
1. GameScene first input → `AUDIO_INIT` event → AudioContext created/resumed
2. GameScene `startPlaying()` → `MUSIC_GAMEPLAY` → gameplay BGM
3. Bird dies → `BIRD_DIED` (death SFX) + `MUSIC_STOP`
4. GameOverScene create → `MUSIC_GAMEOVER` → somber theme

SFX fires on `BIRD_FLAP`, `SCORE_CHANGED`, `BIRD_DIED` via AudioBridge listeners.

BGM uses a Web Audio API step sequencer. SFX use one-shot OscillatorNodes. All audio routes through a master GainNode for mute control.

## Dependencies

| Package | Version | Purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|
| phaser | ^3.90.0 | 2D game engine (Phaser template) |
| three | ^0.183.0 | 3D game engine (Three.js template) |
| vite | ^7.3.1 | Build tool (dev) |

Audio uses the built-in Web Audio API (zero dependencies). Strudel.cc (`@strudel/web`, AGPL-3.0) is available as an optional upgrade for richer BGM — see the game-audio skill.

## Skill Companion Files Convention

Skills use **progressive disclosure** via flat companion `.md` files alongside `SKILL.md`. This keeps `SKILL.md` concise (core patterns, decision trees, checklists) while detailed reference material lives in companion files that agents load on demand.

**Convention:**
- Companion files live in the same directory as `SKILL.md` (e.g., `skills/phaser/conventions.md`)
- Do NOT use a `references/` subdirectory — keep files flat
- Each `SKILL.md` has a `## Reference Files` section near the top listing all companions with descriptions
- In the body, reference extracted content with `See filename.md for [topic].`

**Example (`skills/phaser/`):**
```
skills/phaser/
  SKILL.md                    # Core patterns, process, checklist (~290 lines)
  conventions.md              # Coding conventions and style rules
  project-setup.md            # Vite config, responsive canvas, DPR handling
  scenes-and-lifecycle.md     # Scene management, transitions, parallel scenes
  game-objects.md             # Sprites, buttons, groups, physics
  events-and-state.md         # EventBus patterns, GameState management
  ui-patterns.md              # HUD, menus, score display
  testing-patterns.md         # Playwright test setup and fixtures
  performance.md              # Optimization tips, texture atlases, object pooling
```

**Skills with companion files:** `phaser` (8), `game-qa` (7), `game-audio` (6), `meshyai` (3), `game-assets` (3), `threejs-game` (3+), `make-game` (3).

## Reference vs User-Invocable Skills

Skills come in two flavors with a deliberate separation of concerns:

- **User-invocable skills** (17) — Triggered by slash commands (e.g., `/add-audio`). These handle the full user-facing workflow: detect the game, load reference skills, run the pipeline, validate output. They have `argument-hint` in frontmatter.
- **Reference skills** (10) — Deep domain knowledge loaded by other skills (or directly via `/load`). They contain patterns, code examples, and conventions but don't drive a workflow themselves.

Four domains have both a reference and a user-invocable skill:

| Reference Skill | User-Invocable Skill | Why Both Exist |
|-----------------|---------------------|----------------|
| `game-audio` | `add-audio` | `game-audio` has Web Audio API patterns reused by `add-audio` AND `make-game` step 3 |
| `game-qa` | `qa-game` | `game-qa` has Playwright patterns reused by `qa-game` AND the QA subagent in `make-game` |
| `game-assets` | `add-assets` | `game-assets` has pixel art patterns reused by `add-assets` AND `make-game` step 1.5 |
| `game-designer` | `design-game` | `game-designer` has visual polish patterns reused by `design-game` AND `make-game` step 2 |

This separation avoids duplicating domain knowledge across multiple skills. The reference skill is the single source of truth; the user-invocable skill orchestrates the workflow and loads the reference skill for domain knowledge.

## Common Tasks

**Add a new skill**: Create `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. Follow existing skill format with tech stack, architecture, code examples, and checklist. For skills >300 lines, extract detailed code examples and reference material into companion files.

**Add a new user-invocable skill** (slash command): Create `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`, `argument-hint`). Body contains the prompt instructions.

**Sync to plugin cache**: After editing skill files, copy to your agent's plugin cache directory (e.g. `~/.claude/plugins/cache/local-plugins/game-creator/1.3.0/` for Claude Code).

**Run the example**: `cd examples/flappy-bird && npm run dev` starts on port 3000.

**Run tests**: `cd examples/flappy-bird && npm run test`. Tests auto-start the Vite dev server.

**Quick iterate loop**: `node scripts/iterate-client.js --url http://localhost:3000 --actions-json '[{"buttons":["space"],"frames":4}]'` — captures screenshots, text state, and console errors. Use after every meaningful code change for tight feedback.

## Notes

- Playwright screenshot tests use high pixel tolerance (3000 maxDiffPixels) because parallax clouds scroll between captures.
- Headless Chromium reports low FPS (~7-9). FPS threshold in tests is set to 5. Use Playwright MCP for accurate FPS measurement.
- The `playdotfun` skill is a git submodule at `submodules/playdotfun` (repo: `github.com/playdotfun/skills`). The symlink `skills/playdotfun → ../submodules/playdotfun/skills` makes SKILL.md resolve correctly. After cloning, run `git submodule update --init` to pull the submodule.

## Site & Template Gallery

The site is built from `site/` and output to `_site/`. Two pages: landing page (`_site/index.html`) and template gallery (`_site/gallery/index.html`). Both share CSS, nav, and footer via a unified build script.

**Source of truth**: `site/manifest.json` — 20 entries with id, name, description, engine, genre, complexity, features, source path, thumbnail, and demoUrl.

**Build the site**: `npm run build:site` (runs `node site/build.js`). Generates both `_site/index.html` (landing page with data-driven game cards from manifest) and `_site/gallery/index.html` (filterable gallery). Copies thumbnails. Fetches telemetry stats.

**Capture thumbnails**: `npm run capture:thumbnails` (runs `node site/capture-screenshots.js`). For each template, reuses existing QA screenshots from `output/` or boots the game in headless Chromium. Output: 400x225 PNGs in `site/thumbnails/`.

**Clone a template**: `/use-template <template-id> [project-name]` — copies template source, updates package.json/title, runs npm install. 10-second copy vs 10-minute `/make-game` pipeline.

**Adding a new template to the gallery**: Add an entry to `site/manifest.json`, run `npm run capture:thumbnails`, then `npm run build:site`.

## Template Telemetry

Anonymous, append-only telemetry tracks template usage (clones and clicks). No user data or IPs logged.

**Backend**: `site/telemetry/` — Express + PostgreSQL, deployed on Railway.

**Endpoints**:
- `GET /t?event=clone|click&template=<id>&source=gallery|skill&v=1` — ingestion (returns 204)
- `GET /stats` — aggregated clone/click counts per template (cached 60s)
- `GET /health` — health check

**Telemetry sources**:
- Gallery page fires `click` event on "Use Template" button
- `/use-template` skill fires `clone` event after successful copy (respects `DO_NOT_TRACK` / `DISABLE_TELEMETRY` env vars)

**Gallery integration**: `site/build.js` fetches `/stats` at build time, enriches manifest with clone counts, and embeds them in the HTML. Sort controls (Default/Popular/Trending) re-order cards client-side.

**Environment**: Set `TELEMETRY_URL` to override the default Railway URL. `DATABASE_URL` is required for the backend.

## Play.fun (OpenGameProtocol) Integration

The `/monetize-game` command (and Step 5 of `/make-game`) registers games on [Play.fun](https://play.fun) and integrates the browser SDK.

**Flow**: Auth → Register game → Add SDK to `index.html` + create `src/playfun.js` → Rebuild → Redeploy (here.now or GitHub Pages) → Share play.fun URL on Moltbook

**Auth**: Uses `skills/playdotfun/scripts/playfun-auth.js` for credential management. Supports web callback (localhost:9876) and manual paste.

**SDK**: CDN script (`https://sdk.play.fun/latest`) + `src/playfun.js` that wires EventBus events (score changes, game over) to Play.fun points tracking. Non-blocking — if SDK fails to load, game still works.

**Anti-cheat**: Games are registered with `maxScorePerSession`, `maxSessionsPerDay`, and `maxCumulativePointsPerDay` based on the game's scoring system.

## Troubleshooting

See `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` for common issues including:
- Skill triggering (wrong skill loads, skill doesn't trigger, negative tests)
- Build failures (module not found, port conflicts, empty dist)
- Playwright/QA (browser not found, low FPS in headless, visual regression tolerance)
- Deployment (here.now failures, anonymous expiry, GitHub Pages blank page)
- Play.fun (auth failures, SDK not loading, anti-cheat rejections)
- 3D assets (T-pose, wrong facing, Meshy timeouts)
- Audio (autoplay policy, frequency issues)

## Trigger Test Suite

See `tests/trigger-tests.md` for manual test prompts (5-7 per skill) verifying correct trigger behavior. Covers all 17 user-invocable skills plus negative tests for prompts that should NOT trigger any skill.
