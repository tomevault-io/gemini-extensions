> Second Sidebar is a privileged Firefox and Zen Browser userChrome.js script loaded

# Repository guidance

## Project and runtime

Second Sidebar is a privileged Firefox and Zen Browser userChrome.js script loaded
through fx-autoconfig, [Sine](https://github.com/CosmoCreeper/Sine) (via the
`theme.json` manifest at the repo root), or a compatible script loader. It adds
a second sidebar and web panels to the browser UI. This repository is adapted
for **Zen Browser** while maintaining compatibility with standard Firefox. It
is not a WebExtension or a Node.js/web application: there is no bundler,
development server, or build step. Deploy the contents of `src/` as-is (for
Sine, `theme.json` does this automatically - see "Loader portability" below).

Read `README.md` for features and installation, and the relevant implementation
before changing behavior. Follow applicable user-level agent instructions;
keep machine-specific subagent configuration outside this repository.

## Implementation conventions

- Use ES modules with explicit relative `.mjs` imports. Follow the existing
  two-space indentation, double quotes, semicolons, and Prettier formatting.
  Files use `snake_case`; classes use `PascalCase`; methods use `camelCase`.
- Keep JSDoc consistent with nearby code. Some imports exist only for JSDoc and
  use a targeted `no-unused-vars` suppression; do not remove their type context
  just to silence lint.
- Put behavior in controllers, UI construction in `xul/`, and Firefox API access
  in the corresponding wrapper. Reuse `XULElement` and `utils/xul.mjs` helpers.
  Preserve the XUL/HTML element distinction.
- Support both Zen Browser and standard Firefox layout hierarchies. Avoid hardcoding
  `#browser` when attaching or sizing wrappers; use `requireBrowserContainerElement()`
  or selectors targeting `#zen-tabbox-wrapper, #browser`.
- Use existing `sb2-` IDs/classes and `--sb2-` CSS variables for new sidebar
  styles. In Zen Browser, adhere to `--sb2-zen-*` theme variables, `--zen-border-radius`,
  `--zen-element-separation`, and `--zen-colors-*`. Preserve `:root:has(#zen-tabbox-wrapper)`
  and `[zen-right-side="true"]` rules. Add new CSS exports to `sidebar_decorator.mjs`
  when they need to be injected.
- Match native theme tokens and controls. Keep keyboard focus, shortcuts, tooltips,
  and both sidebar positions working across both browsers.
- When uncollapsing the sidebar in controllers, remove inline margin properties
  (`removeProperty("margin-right")` / `removeProperty("margin-left")`) rather than
  forcing `0px`, allowing Zen's flex/grid layout engine to position adjacent content correctly.
- `MozButton` and `Toggle` wrap HTML custom elements with `isXUL: false`;
  popup/menu wrappers use XUL. Reuse their factories when adding controls.
- Before changing layout CSS, trace the controller that sets the element's
  attributes and geometry. Keep calculated dimensions/offsets in the geometry
  flow; physical panel anchors are not interchangeable with logical CSS spacing.
  Preserve theme-token fallbacks and affected `browser.nova.enabled` rules.
- Update the README when user-visible features or installation steps change.
  Keep edits focused; avoid unrelated formatting or framework/toolchain changes.
- Use `Logger.debug` (`utils/logger.mjs`) for verbose, per-action logging
  (tab lifecycle, per-setting change events, timer state) - it's gated
  behind the `second-sidebar.debug-logging` pref so normal use doesn't spam
  the Browser Console. Reserve plain `console.log` for one-time
  startup/lifecycle announcements (e.g. "X was patched", "Loading Y..."),
  and always use `console.error`/`console.warn` directly for real problems -
  never gate those behind the debug pref.
- Use `safeCall` (`utils/errors.mjs`) to isolate a call into a Firefox/Gecko
  internal that's known (or suspected) to throw unpredictably, so the throw
  can't corrupt this addon's own state or interrupt an event handler
  partway through. See `WebPanelController#removeTab` for the reference
  usage; the underlying issue is documented in `urlbar_input_patcher.mjs`.
- For a new "call one setter, maybe with a small fixed follow-up" web panel
  setting, wire it in `web_panels.mjs` via `#bindSimpleSetting` (or
  `#bindGeometrySetting` for floating-geometry fields, `#bindSimpleAction`
  for no-argument actions) rather than a bespoke `listenEvent` block.
  Debounced edit handlers keep their timers per panel (`KeyedTimeouts`,
  `utils/keyed_timeouts.mjs`), so editing one panel can't cancel another's
  pending update.
  Settings with real branching logic (different values calling different
  methods, debounced timeouts, reload-if-changed checks) stay hand-written
  alongside the bound ones in `#setupListeners`.
- Settings classes that are a flat bag of primitive fields (`SidebarSettings`,
  `WebPanelState`, `FloatingWebPanelGeometrySettings`) implement
  `fromObject`/`toObject` by spreading the source object/instance rather
  than listing every field three times; only override the fields that need
  special handling (nested settings objects, computed defaults). Classes
  with those - `WebPanelSettings` (nested `floatingGeometry`/
  `pinnedGeometry`) and the collection wrappers (`WebPanelsSettings`,
  `WebPanelsState`) - use spread for their flat fields too but keep the
  nested/collection parts explicit; don't force a fully generic schema over
  them.

## Changing settings

Follow an existing setting through these files under `src/second_sidebar/`:

- Sidebar: `xul/sidebar_main_popup_settings.mjs` →
  `controllers/sidebar_main_settings.mjs` → `controllers/events.mjs` → the
  receiving controller → `settings/sidebar_settings.mjs`. Also give it a pref
  in `settings/sidebar_prefs.mjs` and a control in the root `preferences.json`
  (Sine's mod settings dialog), and add its event to `FIELD_EVENTS` in
  `controllers/sidebar_prefs.mjs`; `tests/sidebar_prefs.test.mjs` fails until
  the first two match `SidebarSettings`. Only settings that need the popup's
  own input handling (keyboard shortcuts) are left out.
- Panel editing: `xul/web_panel_popup_edit.mjs` →
  `controllers/web_panel_edit.mjs` → `controllers/events.mjs` →
  `controllers/web_panels.mjs` (bind it with `#bindSimpleSetting` /
  `#bindGeometrySetting` / `#bindSimpleAction` unless it needs real branching
  logic) / `controllers/web_panel.mjs` → `settings/web_panel_settings.mjs`.
  Also check the new-panel popup/controller when the setting should be
  available during creation.

Both settings dialogs apply changes live, and Save persists them. Closing
without saving (Cancel, Escape, clicking outside) asks for confirmation when
something changed, then rolls each changed field back through the popup's
`#getChangeReverters()` list (upstream code, so keep it close to upstream's
shape to ease merges). When adding a setting to either popup, add its
reverter there too, or discarding changes will leave it applied.

Settings export/import (sidebar settings popup → `sidebar_main_settings.mjs`,
file format in `settings/settings_export.mjs`) writes a single JSON file:
`{ version, exportedAt, sidebarSettings, webPanels }` (state such as `lastUrl`
is deliberately excluded - see above). `parseSettingsExport` validates the
whole file (web panel uuids/urls, duplicate uuids, newer `version`) before
anything is written. Import writes straight to the same storage
`SidebarSettings`/`WebPanelsSettings.save()` already use rather than
hot-applying live, since a wholesale replacement can add/remove entire panels
and containers at once; a restart picks it up like any fresh window. Until
then every open window still holds its pre-import settings and would save
them back on ordinary actions (opening, moving or resizing a panel), so the
import first sends `SidebarEvents.SUSPEND_SETTINGS_SAVES`, which makes
`SidebarController.saveSettings()` and `WebPanelsController.saveSettings()`
no-ops in every open window until the browser restarts (never lifted, even if
the write fails: after an earlier import, resuming would let windows save
their pre-import settings over it), then offers to restart. Windows opened
after the import load the imported files, so they aren't suspended. Route
new settings writes through those two methods so they respect the
suspension. Bump
`EXPORT_VERSION` only for a breaking shape change (a field
renamed/repurposed) - a new optional field doesn't need it, since the
settings classes' own constructor defaults already backfill it for older
exports.

## Invariants and sensitive areas

- **Loader portability (fx-autoconfig vs Sine)**: this addon's own files are
  served from different chrome:// origins depending on the loader
  (`chrome://userscripts/content/...` under fx-autoconfig,
  `chrome://sine/content/<mod-id>/...` under Sine). Never hardcode one
  loader's origin when referencing this addon's own assets:
  - Module-to-module imports already use relative `./`/`../` paths - keep it
    that way; never import a sibling module via an absolute `chrome://` URL.
  - To reference a sibling asset (an icon, etc.) from CSS or elsewhere,
    resolve it from the current module's own URL with
    `new URL("../relative/path", import.meta.url).href` (see
    `css/sidebar_main.mjs`), not a hardcoded `chrome://` prefix.
  - To resolve a filesystem path (e.g. for `IOUtils`), use
    `DirectoryServiceWrapper.profileChromeDir` (`wrappers/directory_service.mjs`,
    backed by Gecko's "UChrm" directory-service key) instead of resolving a
    loader-registered chrome:// alias - it works under any loader.
  - `utils/files.mjs`'s `importPatchedModule()` is how the three source
    patchers load their patched copy of a Firefox internal module: it writes
    the copy next to this addon's own files (resolved from
    `import.meta.url`, so whatever chrome:// origin served the addon),
    imports it and deletes it. Don't switch it to fx-autoconfig's
    `chrome://userchrome/content/` alias (not registered under Sine) or a
    `file://` URL (blocked by the CSP Sine applies to dynamically imported
    scripts: `script-src chrome: resource: moz-src:`). Each call uses a
    unique file name, because every window runs the patchers and a shared
    name let one window delete the file while another was importing it.
- **`theme.json`** (repo root) is this fork's Sine mod manifest. Its `scripts`
  field deliberately points at `src/second_sidebar.uc.mjs`'s real, nested
  path rather than assuming a flattened repo - see "Why `src/` stays" below.
  Only the entry point needs listing there; everything it imports is resolved
  by the JS module loader itself, not by Sine's own script registry. Its
  `include` pattern scopes loading to `browser.xhtml` (matching what
  fx-autoconfig already restricts `.uc.mjs` loading to); dropping it would
  make Sine dynamically import this script into every chrome window,
  including ones lacking `gBrowser`/the sidebar's expected DOM.
  Its `preferences` field names the root `preferences.json`, which Sine
  turns into the mod's settings (gear) dialog; each control there edits one
  of the mirrored sidebar prefs (see "Sidebar settings are a JSON string
  preference" below). Sine only picks the file up when it installs or
  updates the mod, i.e. after a `version` bump.
- **Sine's `sine.allow-unsafe-js` gate**: this is not something this repo
  controls, but it's the single most likely reason "installed via Sine but
  the sidebar never appears" gets reported.
  In `core/utils.sys.mjs`'s `getScripts()`, a mod's scripts are only ever
  added to Sine's load list when `this.allowUnsafeJS || mod.origin ===
"store"`. A mod installed by pasting a repository (as opposed to Sine's
  own reviewed marketplace) has `origin` unset, so unless the user has set
  `sine.allow-unsafe-js` to `true` in `about:config`, the script is never
  even attempted - no `include`/`exclude` check, no import, no console
  output, nothing. If a Sine install "does nothing" with an otherwise-clean
  console, check this pref before suspecting `theme.json` or the script
  itself.
- **fx-autoconfig and Sine share one `config.js` per browser installation,
  not per profile.** Both work by pointing Firefox's
  `general.config.filename` at a single bootstrap file inside the browser's
  install directory - there can only be one active at a time. Installing
  Sine's bootloader for any one profile replaces that shared file, silently
  disabling fx-autoconfig's own `chrome/JS/`-scanning bootstrap on **every
  other profile on the same installation**, not just the one Sine was set
  up on. Sine's own mod registry (`mods.json`) is per-profile, so a profile
  that only has this addon copied into `chrome/JS/` ends up with _no_
  loader running it at all once this happens - not a caching issue, not a
  code regression, just no active bootstrap left that knows about it.
  Don't assume a report of "stopped working after installing Sine" is
  about the same profile Sine was added to - ask about sibling profiles on
  the same installation before chasing a code-level cause.
- **Default branch is `main`** (renamed from `master`; upstream still uses
  `master`). Sine reads a mod added without `/tree/<branch>` from `main`,
  so the plain `<owner>/<repo>` works. Older Sine installs added as
  `<owner>/<repo>/tree/master` keep working only through GitHub's rename
  redirect, which stops if a branch named `master` is created again - so
  don't recreate one.
- **Why `src/` stays**: flattening `src/second_sidebar.uc.mjs` and
  `src/second_sidebar/` to the repo root would look tidier and match how
  small single-file Sine mods are usually laid out, but this fork's `src/`
  layout mirrors upstream's, which is what keeps `git merge upstream/master`
  (see the sync playbook below) tractable across ~150 files. `theme.json` can
  point into a nested path just fine, so don't flatten the repo "for
  cleanliness" - that trades a cosmetic win for permanent merge friction.
- **Double-injection guard**: `run()` in `second_sidebar.uc.mjs` sets a
  `sb2-injected` class on `BrowserElements.root` before doing anything else,
  and bails out if it's already set. A profile can have this addon both
  copied into fx-autoconfig's `chrome/JS/` and installed as a Sine mod;
  without the guard both loaders inject into the same window, producing
  duplicate `#sb2-*` elements with colliding ids. Keep the class set
  synchronously, before the first `await`, so two near-simultaneous
  invocations can't both pass the check.
- Preserve startup ordering: wait for `UC_API.Runtime.startupFinished()` or
  `delayedStartupPromise` (fx-autoconfig) or the `browser-delayed-startup-finished`
  observer fallback in `second_sidebar.uc.mjs` (Sine, which defines neither
  global); skip `sb2-webpanels-window` and popup windows; load settings/state
  before creating elements, controllers, and applying values.
- Keep popup detection compatible with extension-created windows. A popup may
  expose `window.toolbar.visible === false` without listing `extrachrome` in its
  `chromehidden` attribute. Never inject `#sb2-wrapper` into these windows.
- `xul/web_panels_browser.mjs` hosts a nested chrome window whose tabs back the
  panels. Its startup observers, SessionStore handling, close commands, popup
  notifications, and URL-bar patches are part of the implementation.
  Validate changes to this code in a real browser instance.
- Keyboard shortcuts pressed in a web panel run in the nested window's own
  keysets (Zen rebuilds them from its shortcut settings, so don't edit its
  `<key>` elements). Commands that act on the browser window rather than the
  page (`MAIN_WINDOW_COMMANDS` in `xul/web_panels_browser.mjs`: new tab,
  reopen closed tab, address bar, web search) are caught in that window
  (capturing `command` listener) and run on the main window's matching
  `<command>` instead: otherwise Zen opens its new-tab address bar in the
  hidden window, and reopening a closed tab can restore a panel's own tab.
  Page commands (find, reload, zoom, print) stay in the panel.
- The panels' window is a full browser window, so Firefox's
  `BrowserWindowTracker` registers it too (the `browser-window-domcontentloaded`
  category), after the main window. That made it the "top window" that links
  from other apps (and other callers of `getTopWindow()`) open in, out of
  sight. `WebPanelsBrowser#initWindow` removes it with
  `BrowserWindowTrackerWrapper.untrack` (Firefox's `untrackForTestsOnly`, the
  only way it offers). Selecting a tab there that isn't a web panel's closes
  the sidebar (`WebPanelsController#setupWebPanelsBrowserListeners`), so
  anything else that can open tabs in that window is a bug too.
- Mods can float the find bar, stretch it over the page, or redefine
  `.browserContainer`'s grid so its `findbar` area is a side column, which
  covers half of a narrow web panel. Putting it back in that area isn't
  enough, so the panels' window gets an agent-level sheet
  (`css/findbar.mjs`, loaded with `WindowWrapper#loadAgentSheet`, since
  mods load their CSS as user sheets with `!important`) pinning it across
  the bottom with absolute positioning and `grid-area: auto`. Leave the
  main window's find bar to Zen and the user's mods: the owner asked for
  that after a main-window override misbehaved when the window was resized.
- Mouse events inside a web panel bubble from that nested window up to the
  main window's listeners (its `<browser>` is the nested window's chrome
  event handler), so `event.target` can belong to the panel's document (see
  `WebPanelsBrowser#activeWebPanelContains`). Their `screenX` isn't in the
  main window's coordinates, though (issue #10): map such events through
  the embedded browser's box, as `SidebarMainCollapser#getScreenX` does.
- Every web panel tab is created with `tab.setUndiscardable(true)`
  (`xul/base/tab.mjs`) so Firefox's automatic memory-pressure tab unloader
  can't silently discard one out from under `WebPanelController`'s own
  `#tab` state - being playing-audio or selected only deprioritizes a tab
  for that unloader, it doesn't exempt it, and that hidden window isn't
  reliably recognized as "foreground" either. If a future Firefox/Zen build
  drops or renames this property, `addWebPanelTab` logs a `console.warn`
  (not gated behind `Logger.debug`) - don't silence that without addressing
  the underlying exposure. Panels are only meant to unload through
  `WebPanelController#unload`/`close()` (including its own
  `unloadAfterInactivity` timer), never through Firefox's own unloader.
- `WebPanelController#unload`/`#removeTab` wrap the actual
  `gBrowser.removeTab()` call in `safeCall` because a Gecko-internal urlbar
  reformat inside `permitUnload` can throw there (see the long comment in
  `urlbar_input_patcher.mjs`); losing that wrapper reintroduces a bug where
  a "closed" panel's tab silently stays alive in the background.
- **Zen Browser chrome containment**: Zen wraps its tabbox and content inside
  `#zen-tabbox-wrapper`. `SidebarBoxArea` (`xul/sidebar_box_area.mjs`) calculates
  dimensions relative to `#zen-tabbox-wrapper` and reserves spacing using
  `--zen-element-separation` (defaulting to 6px) and wrapper side positioning.
  With the sidebar on the window-edge side, `#zen-tabbox-wrapper` loses Zen's
  margin there and `#sb2-main`'s `margin-inline-start` keeps the gap, even
  when collapsed. An overlay sidebar (auto-hide set to overlay) is out of the
  flow, so the wrapper gets that gap back as padding (issue #23), unless the
  **Keep gap at window edge** setting (`autoHideEdgeGap`, `edge-gap` on
  `#sb2-main`) is off. A collapsed `#sb2-main` is only slid out of the
  window, so `[sb2-collapsed]` hides it, or its shadow paints a strip along
  the edge.
- **Zen surfaces**: the sidebar and a pinned panel are deliberately
  transparent (`--sb2-zen-surface`) so Zen's window background shows through,
  like Zen's own sidebar. A floating panel (`#sb2-box[pinned="false"]`) and
  the geometry hint sit over the page, so they get `--sb2-zen-floating-surface`
  (the colour of Zen's floating compact-mode sidebar), or with
  `zen.theme.acrylic-elements` (on by default) the same backdrop blur Zen
  uses under `--sb2-zen-floating-acrylic-surface`, the tint Zen puts over
  that blur (issue #23). Don't drop that tint: with
  `browser.tabs.allow_transparent_browser`, a page can be almost fully
  transparent, leaving the blur nothing to show. Don't rely on
  `--zen-colors-*` alone for a surface over the page: transparency themes and
  mods clear them.
- **Nested panel isolation in Zen**: The embedded chrome window hosting web panels
  must be flagged with `win._zenStartupSyncFlag = "unsynced"` and
  `zen-unsynced-window="true"` during creation and startup observers. This stops
  Zen from treating the panel's internal window as a syncable workspace or tabbox.
  Also ensure `#zen-appcontent-navbar-wrapper` remains hidden inside panel chrome.
- **GPU compositing on Windows (Zen)**: Switching or showing web panels on Windows
  under Zen can occasionally leave a blank frame. `WebPanelsBrowser.forceRepaint()`
  briefly toggles `opacity: 0.9999` to force the compositor to paint content.
- Open settings-style popups (`.sb2-popup`) with
  `Panel#openPopupWithinWindow` / `#openPopupAtScreenWithinWindow`, not
  plain `openPopup`/`openPopupAtScreen`. On Wayland, Firefox leaves popups
  that don't fit on screen to the compositor, which may not move them back,
  so these methods open the popup towards the side of its anchor with more
  room and cap its height to that room (`--sb2-popup-max-height` in
  `css/popups.mjs`). The `second-sidebar.fit-popups-to-window` pref forces
  this on (`true`) or off (`false`) on any platform.
- Web panel icons: `fetchIconURL` (`utils/icons.mjs`) returns the first
  candidate that actually loads as an image in the window
  (`firstLoadableIcon`): Places' stored copy (`cached-favicon:`, only when
  Places returned a favicon, since that protocol serves the default icon for
  unknown ones), the favicon's own URL, Google's favicon service, then
  `FALLBACK_ICON`. Custom icons go through
  `WebPanelButton#setIconWithFallback`. Don't put an unverified network icon
  URL on a button: if it fails to load (a tracker-blocked CDN, an
  unreachable host), the button stays blank.
- Reuse widget readiness helpers such as `doWhenButtonReady`; CustomizableUI
  instances are not always available synchronously in every window.
- A web panel's selector (`WebPanelController#applySelector`) runs as a
  `javascript:` URL in the panel's page, with that website's permissions.
  Build it with `buildSelectorScript` (`utils/selector_script.mjs`), which
  passes the selector as a JSON string literal and percent-encodes the whole
  script (`javascript:` URLs are percent-decoded before they run, so a `%22`
  would otherwise end the string). Never paste a settings value into
  page-side code: settings can come from an imported file.
- Registrations with Firefox's global services (the observer service,
  prefs) outlive the window that made them, so remove them on its `unload`
  (`WebPanelsBrowser#unobserveAll`, `SidebarPrefsController#init`).
  Listeners, timers and `ResizeObserver`s on the window's own objects go away
  with it and need no teardown.
- Modifier-clicks on page links reach `LinkClickController`
  (`controllers/link_click.mjs`) through `patchers/content_click_hook.sys.mjs`,
  which replaces `ClickHandlerParent.prototype.contentAreaClick` (Firefox
  opens Shift/Ctrl-clicked links there, before its click listeners run).
  That prototype is shared by every window, so the hook is imported with
  `ChromeUtils.importESModule` into the shared system global: a replacement
  made in a window's own module would turn into a dead object when that
  window closed, breaking link clicks in every other window. Windows register
  a handler keyed by their `window` (look it up from a browser with
  `ownerDocument.defaultView`; `ownerGlobal` is a different object) and remove
  it on `unload`. Bookmark and history clicks are `command` events with the
  click's modifier keys, caught by a capturing listener on the window. Zen
  Glance takes single-modifier clicks it's set to (Alt by default) in the
  page, before any of this runs, hence the Alt+Shift default.
- Use `controllers/events.mjs` for cross-window actions. Preserve event names,
  UUIDs, payload fields, and `isActiveWindow` behavior. Permanent panels are
  shared across windows; temporary creation is limited to the active window.
  Since events go to every window, a window can receive an event for a
  temporary panel it doesn't have: per-panel listeners must ignore unknown
  uuids (use `WebPanelsController#listenWebPanelEvent`, which the `#bind*`
  helpers already do, or check `webPanelsController.get(uuid)` for null).
- Sidebar settings are a JSON string preference (`second-sidebar.settings`).
  Each one except the keyboard shortcuts is mirrored to its own
  `second-sidebar.*` pref for Sine's settings dialog: `SidebarPrefsController`
  writes them from the JSON at startup and on every save, and applies and
  saves a valid change made to one (invalid values are written back). The
  JSON stays the source of truth, so importing settings doesn't touch the
  mirrored prefs until the restart rewrites them.
  Web panel settings and state are JSON files in the profile's
  `chrome/second-sidebar-data/` (`web-panels.json`, `web-panels-state.json`,
  via `FileSettings` in `settings/settings.mjs`); the older
  `second-sidebar.web-panels`/`second-sidebar.web-panels-state` prefs are only
  read once, to migrate. If saved data can't be read, a copy is kept
  (`*.corrupt-<timestamp>.json`, or a `<pref>.corrupt` pref) before defaults
  are used, since the next save overwrites the original. Preserve saved user
  data and defaults for missing fields. When adding a setting, update its
  model, load/save or `fromObject`/`toObject` paths, UI, and event handling
  together. Keep panel settings distinct from state such as `lastUrl`.
  Web panel saves are debounced and flushed when the window unloads.
- Preserve container identity and the existing loading/security context when
  creating or navigating panel tabs. Account for temporary panels, unload on
  close, reload timers, listeners, and observers when changing panel lifecycle.
- Browser internals are version-sensitive. For patcher changes, inspect the
  actual target browser source and verify the text/regex replacement still matches.
  Define text patches in `patchers/source_patches.mjs` with a `description`:
  `applySourcePatches` reports any that no longer match, and the patchers
  pass those to `reportUnappliedPatches`, which logs a `console.warn` with
  the browser version (so breakage after an update is diagnosable rather than
  silent). Keep that module free of browser globals at import time: the unit
  tests and `scripts/check_patch_targets.mjs` run it in Node. Add runtime
  targets (methods or properties a patcher replaces, like
  `UrlbarInputPatcher`'s) to that script's `requires` list. Preserve
  temporary-module cleanup in `utils/files.mjs`. Keep these patches isolated
  rather than spreading source rewriting through controllers.
- `UrlbarInputPatcher#patchValueFormatterUpdate` only applies to Firefox
  versions with a public `gURLBar.valueFormatter`. Where `gURLBar` is a
  `<moz-urlbar>` element, the formatter is private and `update()` is async,
  so it can't throw inside `removeTab()`; the patch detects that and skips
  itself, and any rejected promise is filtered by
  `#suppressValueFormatterErrors`. Its retry loop is capped (30 s) so it
  can't poll forever.

## Static checks

There is no tracked package manifest, lockfile, or npm script.
`.gitignore` excludes `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, and
`node_modules`; these may exist locally but are not the project contract.
The tracked check definitions are `eslint.config.mjs`, `.prettierrc`,
`tests/`, `scripts/`, and `.github/workflows/`. Unit tests cover pure logic
only (settings round-trips, import/export validation, source patches) and use
Node's built-in test runner, so they need no install.

For a checkout without local tooling, install the lint/format tools from the
repository root (this is development setup, not a runtime dependency):

```sh
npm install --no-save --package-lock=false eslint@9.7.0 @eslint/js@9.7.0 globals@15 prettier@3.9.9
```

Run the checks relevant to changed files:

```sh
npx eslint .
npx prettier --check "src/**/*.mjs" "tests/*.mjs" "scripts/*.mjs" "*.mjs" "*.md" "*.json" ".github/**/*.yml"
node --test "tests/*.test.mjs"
git diff --check
```

When changing a patcher or `patchers/source_patches.mjs`, also run the
patches against current Firefox sources (needs network access; branches of
`mozilla-firefox/firefox`):

```sh
node scripts/check_patch_targets.mjs release beta main
```

For documentation-only edits, check formatting on the edited Markdown files.
For targeted formatting fixes, use `npx prettier --write <changed-files>`.
Do not reformat unrelated files to clear an existing repository-wide failure.
On PowerShell, `npm.cmd`/`npx.cmd` can be used if `.ps1` launchers are blocked.

CI installs ESLint 9.7.0 and uploads SARIF using
`@microsoft/eslint-formatter-sarif@3.1.0`. A lint error fails the workflow;
don't add `continue-on-error` as a way to land something that doesn't pass.
The SARIF report is generated and
uploaded even when the lint step fails. The Prettier workflow uses a dry run
via `creyD/prettier_action`, pinned (`prettier_version`) to the same
Prettier version as the local setup command above; keep the two in sync
when upgrading, or a newer local Prettier can flag untouched files CI
wouldn't. Add legitimate
Firefox/Zen globals to the existing ESLint globals list when needed, rather
than broadly disabling rules; note that VS Code's built-in JS language
service checks JSDoc `@param`/global references independently of ESLint's
globals list (it has its own, separate set of gaps - e.g. it doesn't know
about `BrowsingContext` even though ESLint does), so a stray IDE hint isn't
necessarily an ESLint config gap. Node syntax checks and lint cannot
validate privileged browser APIs or XUL UI.

A **Sync upstream** workflow (`.github/workflows/sync-upstream.yml`) runs every
Monday at 09:00 UTC and opens a Pull Request whenever `aminought/firefox-second-sidebar`
has new commits. It can also be triggered manually via **Actions → Sync upstream →
Run workflow**. Every step after "Decide whether to sync" is gated on its
`proceed` output - an `exit 0` only ends one step, not the job, so don't use
one to skip the rest. It skips the run while a sync PR is still open, and
deletes the branch it pushed if the PR can't be opened. Opening the PR needs
a `SYNC_PAT` repository secret (preferred) or "Allow GitHub Actions to create
and approve pull requests"; see the workflow file header.

Other workflows: **Tests** (`node --test` on pushes and PRs), **Patch
targets** (weekly, and on PRs touching patchers: runs
`scripts/check_patch_targets.mjs` against Firefox release, beta and main) and
**Release** (see below).

### Releases

1. Bump `version` in `theme.json`.
2. Move the `[Unreleased]` notes in `CHANGELOG.md` into a new
   `## [<version>] - <date>` section.
3. Get both onto `main` (usually by merging the PR that carries them).

The **Release** workflow runs whenever `theme.json` changes on `main` and
publishes a GitHub release, tag `v<version>`, for every version that doesn't
have one yet (`scripts/publish_releases.mjs`), with that version's changelog
section and a zip of `src/` at the release's commit for fx-autoconfig users.
There's no tag to push, except for a version released at an older commit
than `main`'s (a backfill): GitHub won't let the workflow's token create a
tag at a commit whose `.github/workflows` differ from `main`'s (HTTP 403),
so the run publishes what it can and prints the `git tag`/`git push`
commands for the rest. A version's release commit is the first commit on
`main`'s first-parent line with that version and its notes, with nothing left
under `[Unreleased]` (early versions were bumped before their notes landed);
an existing tag is kept. Deleting a release gets it published again on the
next run, so delete its tag too, or keep the release. `node
scripts/publish_releases.mjs --dry-run` shows what would be published; pull
requests touching the script or workflow run that too. Add user-visible
changes to `[Unreleased]` as you make them.

## Firefox and Zen Browser validation

Use a dedicated test profile with fx-autoconfig (or Zen's script loader):

1. Locate the test profile folder (in Firefox or Zen, navigate to `about:support`
   and click **Open Folder** / **Show in Finder** next to _Profile Folder_).
2. Copy `src/second_sidebar.uc.mjs` and `src/second_sidebar/` into the profile's
   `chrome/JS/` folder.
3. Ensure `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` and
   `dom.allow_scripts_to_close_windows` are set to `true` in `about:config`.
4. Clear the startup cache (via `about:support` → **Clear startup cache...** or
   by deleting the `startupCache` directory inside the profile folder) and restart.

For changes to `theme.json`, the startup fallback in `second_sidebar.uc.mjs`,
or anything under "Loader portability" above, also install via Sine on a
separate test profile (add the repo as `<owner>/<repo>`, which Sine reads
from the `main` branch, or `<owner>/<repo>/tree/<branch>` to test another
branch) rather than assuming the fx-autoconfig
path alone covers it; the two loaders serve this addon's files from different
chrome:// origins.

Select manual scenarios according to the change:

- **General**: Startup, sidebar show/hide, left/right placement, toolbar customization.
- **Zen-specific scenarios**:
  - Zen vertical tabs / sidebar on left vs right (`[zen-right-side="true"]`).
  - Second sidebar positioned on the same side as Zen's tab bar vs opposite side.
  - Zen compact mode (collapsing Zen's sidebar) and auto-hide overlay behavior.
  - Zen split views and workspace switching while web panels are active.
  - Floating panel placement inside `#zen-tabbox-wrapper` and margin spacing.
  - Windows GPU rendering (ensuring web panels do not open as blank frames).
- **Panels**: Panel create/edit/delete, navigation, close/reopen, and temporary panels.
  Disable "Unload from memory after closing" for panel A, switch from panel A to
  panel B, then close panel B by clicking a browser tab. Confirm panel A does not
  reopen, and reopening panel A preserves its page and session state.
- **Geometry & Lifecycle**: Floating/pinned geometry, resizing, auto-hide, and shortcuts.
- **Multi-window**: A second browser window, propagation of edits, and persistence.
- **Tabs & Media**: Containers, zoom, mute, unload/reload, and permission popups.
- **Extension popups & passkeys**: With a panel open, start and cancel or complete
  a Bitwarden passkey prompt. Confirm the Bitwarden window has no `#sb2-wrapper`,
  its credential list is visible without unloading the panel, and the panel is
  still usable afterward. Open a normal browser window as a control and confirm
  the sidebar still loads there.
- **Theming**: Light/dark themes, Zen accent surfaces, and conditional theme tokens.

Check the Browser Console (`Ctrl+Shift+J` or `Cmd+Shift+J`) for errors. Record the
browser version (Firefox or Zen), operating system, and scenarios actually exercised.
If the browser cannot be run, state which runtime checks remain unverified.

## Upstream synchronization playbook

This fork tracks `aminought/firefox-second-sidebar` (upstream) while preserving
Zen Browser patches contributed by `Ezo-mas/zen-second-sidebar-fix`.

### Remote hierarchy

| Remote     | URL                                     | Purpose                         |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `origin`   | `sinazadeh/zen-second-sidebar-enhanced` | Your fork (push target)         |
| `upstream` | `aminought/firefox-second-sidebar`      | Original source of truth        |
| `Ezo-mas`  | `Ezo-mas/zen-second-sidebar-fix`        | Zen patch reference (read-only) |

The GitHub UI **Sync fork** button targets `Ezo-mas` (the immediate parent fork).
Always sync from `upstream` via the terminal or the **Sync upstream** workflow.

### Sync procedure

```sh
# 1. Fetch the latest upstream commits
git fetch upstream

# 2. Check how many new commits exist
git log HEAD..upstream/master --oneline

# 3. Merge into main (this fork's default branch; upstream's is still master)
git checkout main
git merge upstream/master

# 4. Resolve conflicts (see hotspots below), then:
git add <resolved-files>
git commit
git push origin main
```

### Known conflict hotspots

These files are the most likely to conflict because upstream changes code
this fork has also modified:

1. **`src/second_sidebar/controllers/sidebar_main.mjs`** — `uncollapse()` method:
   - **Keep** `removeProperty("margin-right")` / `removeProperty("margin-left")`
     (Zen patch — allows Zen's flex engine to manage spacing).
   - **Accept** any new upstream additions to `#clearCollapseTransitionEndListener()`
     or other new methods alongside, rather than discarding them.

2. **`src/second_sidebar/css/common.mjs`** — `:root` CSS variable block:
   - **Keep** all `--sb2-zen-*` variable definitions (Zen patch).
   - **Accept** any new upstream `@media -moz-pref("browser.nova.enabled")` blocks.
   - **Keep** both `#browser,` and `#zen-tabbox-wrapper {` in the `position: relative`
     rule at the bottom of the file.

3. **`.github/workflows/*.yml`** — upstream's workflows trigger on `master`, and
   its ESLint lint step sets `continue-on-error: true`:
   - **Keep** this fork's `branches: ["main"]` triggers and its failing lint step.

`theme.json`, `wrappers/directory_service.mjs`, and the loader-portability
fixes described above are fork-only additions upstream doesn't have, so
merges won't touch or conflict with them - but they also won't gain any
upstream improvements automatically. If upstream ever changes how
`css/sidebar_main.mjs` or `utils/files.mjs` resolve their own assets/paths,
re-apply the loader-portability treatment on top of upstream's version
rather than taking upstream's as-is.

The patchers diverge from upstream too: their text patches live in
`patchers/source_patches.mjs` and their module loading in
`importPatchedModule()`. When upstream changes a replacement in one of its
`patchers/*_patcher.mjs` files, port the change into `source_patches.mjs`
(and `tests/source_patches.test.mjs`) instead of restoring upstream's inline
version.

### Zen compatibility checklist

Before committing any change to source files, verify:

- [ ] Container attachment uses `requireBrowserContainerElement()` (not bare `#browser`).
- [ ] New CSS selectors target `#zen-tabbox-wrapper` alongside `#browser` where needed.
- [ ] Sidebar uncollapse uses `removeProperty("margin-right")` / `removeProperty("margin-left")`
      rather than setting `0px` inline.
- [ ] Nested panel windows are marked with `_zenStartupSyncFlag = "unsynced"` and
      `zen-unsynced-window="true"`.
- [ ] New `--sb2-*` CSS variables have Zen-aware fallbacks using `--sb2-zen-*` tokens.
- [ ] Both `[zen-right-side="true"]` sidebar positions work correctly.
- [ ] `WebPanelsBrowser.forceRepaint()` is called after tab switches on Windows.
- [ ] `npx prettier --write`, `npx eslint` and `node --test "tests/*.test.mjs"` pass.
