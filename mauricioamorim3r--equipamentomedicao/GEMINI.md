# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a **Metrological Equipment Management System** for oil & gas operations, built with:
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite + Wouter (routing) + TanStack Query + Radix UI + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Express.js + TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Neon) with Drizzle ORM
- **Deployment**: Render.com (production)

The system manages calibrations, equipment, measurement points, orifice plates, wells testing, chemical analysis, seals/locks, uncertainty control, and notifications for oil & gas production facilities.

## Essential Commands

### Development
```bash
npm run dev              # Start development server (tsx server/index.ts)
npm run build            # Build for production (vite build + esbuild server)
npm start                # Run production build
npm run check            # TypeScript check (currently disabled - outputs message)
npm run check-strict     # Strict TypeScript check (tsc without noEmit)
```

### Database Management
```bash
npm run db:push          # Push schema changes to database (drizzle-kit push)
npm run db:migrate       # Run migrations (drizzle-kit migrate)
npm run db:generate      # Generate migrations from schema (drizzle-kit generate)
```

### Database Seeding & Scripts
- Scripts are located in `server/scripts/`
- Key scripts include:
  - `seed-data.ts` - Seeds initial data (polos, campos, instalações, equipment, etc.)
  - `inserir-placas-ajustadas.ts` - Insert/update orifice plates
  - `relatorio-status-final.ts` - Generate status reports
  - `verificar-*.ts` - Verification scripts for data integrity

To run scripts: `tsx server/scripts/<script-name>.ts`

## Architecture

### Monorepo Structure
```
client/              # React frontend (Vite root is here)
  src/
    components/      # Reusable UI components
    pages/           # Route pages (lazy loaded)
    lib/             # Utilities, query client, hooks
server/              # Express backend
  routes.ts          # API route definitions
  storage.ts         # Database abstraction layer (IStorage interface)
  db.ts              # Database connection (Drizzle + Neon)
  scripts/           # Database seed & utility scripts
  upload.ts          # File upload (multer)
  exportUtils.ts     # Excel/report exports
  templateUtils.ts   # Import/export templates
shared/              # Shared code between client/server
  schema.ts          # Drizzle schema & Zod validation
```

### Key Architectural Patterns

1. **Database Layer**: All database operations go through `storage.ts` which implements the `IStorage` interface. Never query the database directly elsewhere - use storage methods.

2. **Schema Definition**: `shared/schema.ts` is the single source of truth for:
   - Database tables (Drizzle)
   - Relations
   - Validation schemas (Zod)
   - TypeScript types (exported from table inference)

3. **API Routes**: All API routes are in `server/routes.ts`:
   - Health checks: `/api/health` and `/api/health/database`
   - REST patterns: GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE for all entities
   - Exports: `/api/export/*` endpoints
   - File uploads: Use multer middleware from `upload.ts`

4. **Frontend State**: Uses TanStack Query for server state:
   - Query client configured in `client/src/lib/queryClient.ts`
   - Custom hooks in `client/src/lib/` for API interactions
   - Mutations invalidate queries to refetch data

5. **Routing**: Wouter (not React Router) for client-side routing:
   - Routes defined in `client/src/App.tsx`
   - All pages are lazy-loaded for code splitting
   - Base path is `/` (not `/client`)

6. **Path Aliases**:
   - `@/*` → `client/src/*`
   - `@shared/*` → `shared/*`
   - `@assets/*` → `attached_assets/*` (configured in vite.config.ts and tsconfig.json)

### Critical Database Relationships

The system has a hierarchical organizational structure:
- **Polos** (Oil & Gas Hubs) → have many Campos, Instalações, Equipamentos
- **Campos** (Fields) → belong to Polos
- **Instalações** (Installations) → belong to Polos and optionally Campos
- **Equipamentos** (Equipment) → belong to Instalações and Polos
- **Pontos de Medição** (Measurement Points) → belong to Instalações and Polos, reference multiple equipment via serial numbers

Equipment can have:
- **Plano de Calibração** (Calibration Plans)
- **Histórico de Calibrações** (Calibration History)
- **Calendário de Calibrações** (Calibration Calendar/Schedule)
- **Execução de Calibrações** (Calibration Execution) - stores last 3 certificates with technical data
- **Certificados de Calibração** (Calibration Certificates) - historical records with ordem_certificado
- **Placas de Orifício** (Orifice Plates)
- **Trechos Retos** (Straight Sections)
- **Medidores Primários** (Primary Meters)

Other entities:
- **Poços** (Wells) → have **Testes** (Well Tests)
- **Válvulas** (Valves) → with leak testing
- **Controle de Incertezas** (Uncertainty Control) → for measurement points
- **Análises Químicas** (Chemical Analysis) - multiple types: generic, chromatography, PVT
- **Gestão de Cilindros** (Cylinder Management)
- **Sistema de Notificações** (Notification System) - auto-generated alerts
- **Lacres** (Seals) - physical, electronic, and control logs

### TypeScript Configuration

- **Strict mode is DISABLED** (`tsconfig.json` has `strict: false`)
- When adding new code, prefer type-safe patterns but don't require strict compliance
- Use `z.infer<typeof schema>` for types from Zod schemas
- `npm run check` is disabled; use `npm run check-strict` for actual checks

## Environment Variables

Required in `.env` (see `.env.example`):
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection (Neon serverless)
- `NODE_ENV` - `development` or `production`
- `PORT` - Server port (default: 3000 dev, 10000 prod)
- `APP_URL` - Application URL (for production)
- `SESSION_SECRET` - Session encryption key
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` - (Optional) Google Gemini AI
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - (Optional) OpenAI GPT

## Development Notes

1. **Server runs on single port**: Both API and frontend are served from the same Express server
   - Development: Vite dev server is integrated via `setupVite()` in `server/vite.ts`
   - Production: Serves static files from `dist/public/`

2. **Database migrations**: When changing `shared/schema.ts`:
   ```bash
   npm run db:generate  # Generate migration
   npm run db:push      # Apply to database
   ```

3. **Adding new entities**: Follow this pattern:
   - Add table to `shared/schema.ts`
   - Add relations
   - Export Zod insert schema and TypeScript types
   - Add storage interface methods to `IStorage` in `storage.ts`
   - Implement storage methods
   - Add API routes in `routes.ts`
   - Create frontend page in `client/src/pages/`
   - Add route to `client/src/App.tsx`

4. **Code splitting**: All pages are lazy-loaded. Keep this pattern when adding new pages.

5. **Forms**: Use `react-hook-form` with `@hookform/resolvers` + Zod schemas from `shared/schema.ts`

6. **UI Components**: Built with Radix UI primitives + custom styling (Tailwind). Located in `client/src/components/ui/`

7. **File uploads**: Handled by multer middleware. Upload endpoints return file paths that are stored in database.

8. **Exports**: Excel exports use `xlsx` library. PDF exports use `jspdf` + `jspdf-autotable`. Template generation is in `server/templateUtils.ts`.

## Production Deployment

- Deployed on Render.com
- Build command: `npm run build`
- Start command: `npm start`
- Port 10000 is used in production (configured in `server/index.ts`)
- Database: Neon PostgreSQL (serverless)
- Post-build: `npm run db:push` applies schema changes

## Special Features

1. **Metrological Classification**: Equipment classified as fiscal/apropriação/operacional (fiscal/allocation/operational)
2. **Calibration Tracking**: Maintains last 3 calibration certificates with full technical data
3. **Well Testing**: 90-day testing cycles for production wells
4. **Uncertainty Control**: Tracks measurement uncertainty vs ANP (Brazilian oil agency) limits
5. **Seal Management**: Physical & electronic seals for fiscal measurement points
6. **Notification System**: Auto-generates alerts for calibration expiration, well testing, etc.
7. **Multi-level Hierarchy**: Supports complex organizational structures (Polos → Campos → Instalações → Equipment)
