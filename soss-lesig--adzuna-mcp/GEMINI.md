## Part A: Standing Instructions

This is the adzuna-mcp project. A Model Context Protocol server wrapping the Adzuna job search API, built for use with AI assistants during a UK job search. Second in a series of job board MCP servers (after reed-mcp), designed to be combined later in an aggregator layer.

The architectural reasoning behind every decision in this project lives in the Obsidian vault at `/Users/drewbs/dev/drewbs-vault/mayus-vault/projects/adzuna-mcp/DECISIONS.md`. The full Adzuna API reference is at `docs/api-reference.md` in the same vault. Read both before making any structural changes. If a decision needs revisiting, add a new dated entry to DECISIONS.md rather than mutating an existing one.

### Ground Rules

- **Explain before executing.** Walk through planned changes before writing anything. One step at a time.
- **Never commit or push without explicit sign-off.** Stage changes, show `git status`, wait for confirmation.
- **British English.** No long em dashes in any written content.
- **Conventional commits.** `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, `chore:`. Short messages, detail in PR descriptions later.
- **Branch naming:** `feature/kebab-case`, `fix/kebab-case`.
- **Earn complexity.** No TypeScript, no monorepo, no tests yet. The scope is deliberately tight. If you think something needs adding, check `ROADMAP.md` in the vault for whether it's already been deferred or explicitly declined.
- **Vault-currency checkpoint.** Before starting any numbered build step, confirm the vault is current. If a decision was made, a lesson was learned, or something unexpected happened since the last vault write, write it to `DECISIONS.md` and/or `docs/session-notes.md` before proceeding.

### Language and Tooling

- **JavaScript, ESM.** `"type": "module"` in package.json. No TypeScript.
- **Node 20+** with the `--env-file=.env` flag for env loading. Never use the `dotenv` package.
- **MCP SDK:** `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` (the official one). Dual transport: stdio and Streamable HTTP.
- **HTTP transport uses Express** for the minimal routing around `/mcp`.

### Code Documentation (enforced)

These four rules are enforced on every source file. The goal is that a reader who has never seen this codebase can understand any file on first read.

1. **JSDoc every exported function and class.** Document parameters with types, the return value, and any errors thrown. Single-line JSDoc is fine for one-arg helpers; multi-line for anything non-trivial.
2. **Per-file header comment at the top of every source file.** One paragraph, maximum five lines. Explains what the file is, why it exists, and how it relates to the rest of the codebase. Written in prose, not a bulleted list.
3. **Inline comments only for non-obvious choices.** Explain the *why*, not the *what*.
4. **Decisions made during coding go in `DECISIONS.md` in the vault.** If an implementation choice emerges that was not planned, add a new dated entry.

### Code Walkthrough (enforced)

The vault file `docs/code-walkthrough.md` is a prose tour guide to the codebase. **Update rule: the walkthrough is updated in the same commit as the code change it describes, or in a chained commit immediately after.** Never at session close. Walkthrough and code must not drift.

### Key File Locations

- **Repo:** `/Users/drewbs/dev/projects/repos/adzuna-mcp`
- **Vault:** `/Users/drewbs/dev/drewbs-vault/mayus-vault/projects/adzuna-mcp/`
  - `README.md` - project overview
  - `DECISIONS.md` - architectural decisions log (read this for the "why")
  - `ROADMAP.md` - build queue and deferred items
  - `docs/api-reference.md` - full Adzuna API endpoint and parameter mapping
  - `docs/session-notes.md` - live session log (to be created)
  - `docs/code-walkthrough.md` - prose tour of the codebase (to be created)
- **Sibling project:** `/Users/drewbs/dev/projects/repos/reed-mcp` (reference for patterns)

### Adzuna API Key Differences from Reed

- **Two env vars:** `ADZUNA_APP_ID` and `ADZUNA_APP_KEY` (not a single key).
- **Auth via query params**, not Basic Auth header. Client appends `app_id` and `app_key` to every request URL.
- **Distance in kilometres**, not miles.
- **No separate job detail endpoint.** Search returns all available fields. Description is a snippet only.
- **Pagination via page number in URL path** (`/search/1`, `/search/2`), not offset.
- **Location is a nested object** with `display_name` and `area` array, not a flat string.
- **Documented rate limits:** 25/min, 250/day, 1000/week, 2500/month.
- **Parameter names use snake_case** (`results_per_page`, `sort_by`, `what_exclude`). We translate to camelCase in our Zod schemas for consistency with reed-mcp's developer experience.

### Session Close Checklist

1. Append a dated entry to `docs/session-notes.md` in the vault.
2. Tick off completed items in `ROADMAP.md`.
3. If any architectural decision was made, add a new entry to `DECISIONS.md`.
4. Verify `docs/code-walkthrough.md` reflects the current state of the code.
5. Stage all changes, show `git status`, wait for sign-off before committing.
6. Confirm `jcodemunch` indexing at session close.

## Part B: Current Session Brief

**Session:** 1
**Date:** 6 May 2026
**Goal:** Scaffold the project and build the Adzuna API client.

### Context

This repo was bootstrapped by copying reed-mcp's scaffold. Config files (package.json, .env.example) have been updated for Adzuna. Source files still contain reed-mcp code that needs rewriting.

### Build queue

Every step that creates or edits a `src/` file also updates the matching section in `docs/code-walkthrough.md` in the same commit.

1. **Strip reed-mcp source files.** Delete `src/reed-client.js` and gut the tool files. Keep the structural patterns (file headers, export shapes) but remove Reed-specific logic.
2. **Build `src/adzuna-client.js`** - `AdzunaClient` class wrapping the Adzuna API. Query param auth (`app_id` + `app_key`). `AdzunaApiError` class with the same error taxonomy as reed-mcp (`RATE_LIMITED`, `AUTH_FAILED`, `UPSTREAM_ERROR`, `NOT_FOUND`, `BAD_REQUEST`). API call counter for rate limit visibility. Methods: `search(params)`, `getCategories(country)`, and later `getHistory`, `getHistogram`, `getTopCompanies`, `getJobsworth`. v0.1.0 ships with `search` only.
3. **Build `src/tools/search-jobs.js`** - Zod schema with translated param names (see DECISIONS.md entry on parameter naming). Handler calls `client.search()`, formats results. Include `count`, `mean`, and attribution metadata in response.
4. **Build `src/tools/_shared.js`** - `formatJob`, `formatSalary`, `formatLocation`, `messageForError`, `truncate`. Adapted from reed-mcp but handling Adzuna's nested location objects and predicted salary flag.
5. **Build `src/server.js`** - Same pattern as reed-mcp. `createServer({ appId, appKey })` factory, closure-binding loop for tool registration.
6. **Build `src/index.stdio.js`** - Reads `ADZUNA_APP_ID` and `ADZUNA_APP_KEY` from env. Fails loudly if either missing.
7. **Build `src/index.http.js`** - Same stateless pattern as reed-mcp. Origin allowlist.
8. **Update npm scripts** - Already done in package.json.
9. **Update `Dockerfile`** and `railway.json` - Minimal changes (env var names).
10. **Write `README.md`** - Railway deploy button, stdio config snippet, attribution section (Adzuna ToS requires "Jobs by Adzuna" branding), credit folathecoder's Python implementation.
11. **Write `docs/deploy.md`** - Railway, Docker, manual.
12. **Local test: stdio** - verify startup and basic MCP initialise.
13. **Local test: HTTP** - curl `/mcp`, verify response.
14. **Create GitHub remote** (already created). Push.
15. **Deploy to Railway** - set `ADZUNA_APP_ID` and `ADZUNA_APP_KEY` env vars.
16. **End-to-end test** in Claude.ai.
17. **Tag v0.1.0** and push.
18. **npm publish** as `adzuna-mcp`.
19. **Session close** - vault updates, indexing.

### Things NOT in scope for v0.1.0

- Salary history, histogram, top companies, categories, jobsworth tools (v0.2.0).
- Response caching / rate limit throttling (deferred).
- Portfolio page, blog post.
- Tests, TypeScript, CI/CD.
- Anything in "Explicitly deferred" or "Not going to happen" in ROADMAP.md.

### Reference

- **Adzuna API docs:** https://developer.adzuna.com
- **Full API reference in vault:** `docs/api-reference.md`
- **reed-mcp source (pattern reference):** `/Users/drewbs/dev/projects/repos/reed-mcp/src/`
- **Prior art:** folathecoder/adzuna-job-search-mcp (Python, stdio only)
