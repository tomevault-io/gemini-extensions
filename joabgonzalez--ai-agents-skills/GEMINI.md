# AI Agents Skills Framework

CLI for creating, managing, and distributing AI agent skills across 11 AI agents. Local-first architecture with symlink-based installation, dependency resolution, and token-efficient model instructions.

## How to Use Skills (MANDATORY WORKFLOW)

This project has skills installed in your model's skills directory. Follow this protocol for ALL coding tasks:

### Step 1: Find the Trigger

Check the "Mandatory Skills" table below. Match your task to the "Trigger" column.

### Step 2: Read the Skill

Find your agent below and use the corresponding path:

| Agent | Skills path |
|-------|------------|
| Claude Code | `.claude/skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md` |
| Antigravity | `.agent/skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md` |
| OpenClaw | `skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md` |
| Amp, Cline, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, Kimi, OpenCode | `.agents/skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md` |

**Shortcut:** All skill source files live at `skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md` — if your agent can't resolve symlinks, read from there directly.

### Step 3: Read Dependencies

Every skill lists dependencies in its frontmatter (`metadata.skills`). Read each direct dependency before proceeding.

**Example:** `react` skill depends on: `a11y`, `typescript`, `javascript`, `architecture-patterns`

Read these 4 direct dependencies. Dependencies are resolved transitively - when you read `typescript`, you'll see it depends on `javascript`, which depends on `code-conventions`. The dependency chain ensures you have all required context.

### Step 4: Apply Patterns

- Follow "Critical Patterns" marked with ✅ REQUIRED
- Use "Decision Tree" for implementation choices
- Reference inline code examples

### Example Workflow

**Task:** "Create TypeScript interface for User model"

1. **Check table below** → Trigger: "TypeScript types/interfaces" → Skill: `typescript`
2. **Read:** `skills/typescript/SKILL.md` (or your agent's path from Step 2)
3. **Check frontmatter** → Dependencies: `javascript`
4. **Read dependency:**
   - `skills/javascript/SKILL.md` (which depends on `code-conventions`)
5. **Apply patterns:** Use `interface` (not `type`), PascalCase names, export from `types/` directory

## Mandatory Skills

**Path:** Use the table in Step 2 above to find the correct path for your agent.

**IMPORTANT FOR LLMs:** When reading skills, you will encounter a 3-layer symlink structure:

1. **Source of truth:** `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` (real files, always read from here)
2. **Canonical layer:** `.agents/skills/<skill-name>/` → `skills/<skill-name>/` (shared symlinks)
3. **Model-specific layer:** `.claude/skills/` and `.agent/skills/` → `.agents/skills/` (dedicated model symlinks)

**How to access skills:**

- **Preferred:** Read directly from `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` (bypasses symlinks — always works)
- **Alternative:** Use your agent's path from Step 2 if your IDE resolves symlinks automatically
- **If symlinks fail:** All real skill files are in `skills/` directory

### Skills Storage Architecture

**Why 3 layers?**

1. **Layer 1 (skills/):** Single source of truth — edit once, affects all agents
2. **Layer 2 (.agents/skills/):** Canonical shared location — 8 universal agents read here natively
3. **Layer 3 (.claude/skills/, .agent/skills/):** Dedicated model symlinks for Claude Code and Antigravity

**Benefits:**

- **Zero duplication:** Skills stored once, available to all 11 agents
- **Always up-to-date:** Changes propagate instantly (symlinks reference same files)
- **Token-efficient:** Models read only the skills they need

**Example flow:**

```
User edits: skills/react/SKILL.md
      ↓
Symlink: .agents/skills/react/ → skills/react/
      ↓
Universal agents (Amp, Cline, Codex, Cursor, Gemini, Copilot, Kimi, OpenCode)
      read: .agents/skills/react/ directly
      ↓
Dedicated agents get additional symlinks:
  .claude/skills/react/ → .agents/skills/react/   (Claude Code)
  .agent/skills/react/  → .agents/skills/react/   (Antigravity)
      ↓
OpenClaw reads: skills/react/ directly (project root, no symlink needed)
      ↓
All 11 agents see updated react skill instantly
```

## Workflows

### Create a Skill

1. Read `skills/skill-creation/SKILL.md`
2. `mkdir skills/{name}` + copy SKILL-TEMPLATE.md
3. Write SKILL.md with frontmatter and sections
4. Validate: `npx ai-agents-skills validate --skill {name}`
5. Install: `npx ai-agents-skills local`

### Create an Agent

1. Read `skills/agent-creation/SKILL.md`
2. Gather context (9 questions)
3. Create `presets/{project-name}/AGENTS.md`
4. Validate all referenced skills exist

### Update Website

The website (`website/`) is an Astro SSG site that auto-renders skills from `skills/` via content collections.

1. Read `skills/astro/SKILL.md` and `skills/tailwindcss/SKILL.md`
2. Pages live in `website/src/pages/` — skills rendered via `[name]/index.astro`
3. Layouts: `BaseLayout.astro` (shell), `SkillLayout.astro` (two-column with sidebar)
4. Components: `SkillMeta`, `ReferenceSidebar`, `TableOfContents`, `Breadcrumb`
5. Styles: Tailwind v4 via `@theme` in `website/src/styles/global.css` (no `tailwind.config.*`)
6. Build: `cd website && npm run build` — deploys via GitHub Actions on push to `main`

**Key conventions:**
- Reference sidebar uses `{slug, title}[]` — titles extracted from H1 of each reference file
- Skills H1: topic name only, no "Skill" suffix (e.g., `# React`, not `# React Skill`)
- `---` separator required before every `##` section except the first

### Install Skills

```bash
npx ai-agents-skills local                    # Install to all detected models
npx ai-agents-skills local --models claude     # Install to specific model
npx ai-agents-skills validate --all            # Validate all skills
```

## Policies

- **Explicit dependencies:** Skills declare all their dependencies in `metadata.skills` — no hidden auto-includes
- **Dependency resolution:** Auto-resolve with cycle detection and topological sort
- **Two-tier model architecture:**
  - **Dedicated models** — require their own skills directory:
    - Claude Code (`.claude/skills/`), Antigravity (`.agent/skills/`), OpenClaw (`skills/`)
  - **Universal models** — read `.agents/skills/` natively, no extra directory needed:
    - Amp, Cline, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, Kimi, OpenCode
- **Symlink architecture:** 3-layer structure for zero duplication:
  - **Layer 1:** `skills/` (source of truth — real files; also OpenClaw's native path)
  - **Layer 2:** `.agents/skills/` → `skills/` (canonical shared symlinks — universal coverage)
  - **Layer 3:** `.claude/skills/` and `.agent/skills/` → `.agents/skills/` (dedicated model symlinks)
  - **Individual skill symlinks:** Each skill gets its own symlink (NOT directory-level)
  - **Instant propagation:** Changes to source files visible to all agents immediately
- **Auto-generated instructions:** Each model gets an instruction file listing all installed skills with their metadata
- **Dependency-safe removal:** `remove` command validates dependencies before removing skills
- **11 agents supported:** 3 dedicated (Claude Code, Antigravity, OpenClaw) + 8 universal (Amp, Cline, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, Kimi, OpenCode)

## Git & Release Workflow

### Branching

- **`main`** — production, always stable, tagged releases only
- **`development`** — integration branch, all feature work merges here first
- Feature branches off `development`, never off `main`

### Commit Strategy

- **Use skill:** `technical-communication` for all commit messages
- **Format:** single line, imperative, no co-author
- **Examples:**
  - `fix: show interactive selector when all AGENTS.md skills installed`
  - `feat: add PostHog analytics for web and CLI`
  - `chore: update OG image to match logo`
- **Group by feature:** separate commits per logical change, never batch unrelated changes

### Merge to Main (Squash)

Merges from `development` → `main` use **squash merge**. The squash commit message format encodes the release type and triggers the auto-release pipeline:

```
release(patch|minor|major): {brief summary of what's in the squash}
```

Examples:
- `release(patch): telemetry + PostHog analytics + CI release pipeline`
- `release(minor): preset system overhaul + new skills`

### Versioning & Release

Versions follow **semver**: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`

| Change type | Squash merge prefix | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Bug fix, small improvement | `release(patch): ...` | 1.6.0 → 1.6.1 |
| New feature, backwards-compatible | `release(minor): ...` | 1.6.0 → 1.7.0 |
| Breaking change | `release(major): ...` | 1.6.0 → 2.0.0 |

**Release flow:**
1. Work on `development`, commit with single-line messages
2. Squash merge to `main` with a `release(patch|minor|major): {summary}` message
3. `auto-release.yml` detects the prefix on push to `main`, runs `npm version <type>`, and pushes the version commit + tag — no manual command needed
4. `auto-release.yml` bumps the version, builds, publishes to npm, updates the README badge, and syncs back to `development` — all in one pipeline

**Tags always go on `main`**, never on `development`.

## CodeGraph

This project has a CodeGraph MCP server (`codegraph_*` tools) configured. CodeGraph is a tree-sitter-parsed knowledge graph of every symbol, edge, and file. Reads are sub-millisecond and return structural information grep cannot.

### When to prefer codegraph over native search

Use codegraph for **structural** questions — what calls what, what would break, where is X defined, what is X's signature. Use native grep/read only for **literal text** queries (string contents, comments, log messages) or after you already have a specific file open.

| Question | Tool |
|---|---|
| "Where is X defined?" / "Find symbol named X" | `codegraph_search` |
| "What calls function Y?" | `codegraph_callers` |
| "What does Y call?" | `codegraph_callees` |
| "What would break if I changed Z?" | `codegraph_impact` |
| "Show me Y's signature / source / docstring" | `codegraph_node` |
| "Give me focused context for a task/area" | `codegraph_context` |
| "Survey an unfamiliar module/topic" | `codegraph_explore` |
| "What files exist under path/" | `codegraph_files` |
| "Is the index healthy?" | `codegraph_status` |

### Rules of thumb

- **Trust codegraph results.** They come from a full AST parse. Do NOT re-verify them with grep — that's slower, less accurate, and wastes context.
- **Don't grep first** when looking up a symbol by name. `codegraph_search` is faster and returns kind + location + signature in one call.
- **Don't chain `codegraph_search` + `codegraph_node`** when you just want context — `codegraph_context` is one call.
- **`codegraph_explore` is the heavy hitter** for unfamiliar areas — returns full source from all relevant files in one call, but is token-heavy.
- **Index lag**: the file watcher debounces ~500ms behind writes; don't re-query immediately after editing a file in the same turn.

### If `.codegraph/` doesn't exist

The MCP server returns "not initialized." Ask the user: *"I notice this project doesn't have CodeGraph initialized. Want me to run `codegraph init -i` to build the index?"*
