title: Build a standalone plugin
---

## Preface

Please read the docs on [panel plugin development](../plugins/panel-plugins) and the [getting started guide](getting-started) before continuing.

## Introduction

In this walkthrough, we'll build a simple plugin that adds a new form component that can be used in forms. This also means it will be available to users in their panels.

You can find the final code for this plugin at [https://github.com/awcodes/headings](https://github.com/awcodes/headings).

## Step 1: Create the plugin

First, we'll create the plugin using the steps outlined in the [getting started guide](getting-started#creating-a-plugin).

## Step 2: Clean up

Next, we'll clean up the plugin to remove the boilerplate code we don't need. This will seem like a lot, but since this is a simple plugin, we can remove a lot of the boilerplate code.

Remove the following directories and files:
1. `bin`
2. `config`
3. `database`
4. `src/Commands`
5. `src/Facades`
6. `stubs`

Now we can clean up our `composer.json` file to remove unneeded options.

```json
"autoload": {
    "psr-4": {
        // We can remove the database factories
        "Awcodes\Headings\Database\Factories\": "database/factories/"
    }
},
"extra": {
    "laravel": {
        // We can remove the facade
        "aliases": {
            "Headings": "Awcodes\Headings\Facades\ClockWidget"
        }
    }
},
```

Normally, Filament recommends that users style their plugins with a custom filament theme, but for the sake of example let's provide our own stylesheet that can be loaded asynchronously using the new `x-load` features in Filament v3. So, let's update our `package.json` file to include `cssnano`, `postcss`, `postcss-cli` and `postcss-nesting` to build our stylesheet.

```json
{
    "private": true,
    "scripts": {
        "build": "postcss resources/css/index.css -o resources/dist/headings.css"
    },
    "devDependencies": {
        "cssnano": "^6.0.1",
        "postcss": "^8.4.27",
        "postcss-cli": "^10.1.0",
        "postcss-nesting": "^13.0.0"
    }
}
```

Then we need to install our dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

We will also need to update our `postcss.config.js` file to configure postcss.

```js
module.exports = {
    plugins: [
        require('postcss-nesting')(),
        require('cssnano')({
            preset: 'default',
        }),
    ],
};
```

You may also remove the testing directories and files, but we'll leave them in for now, although we won't be using them for this example, and we highly recommend that you write tests for your plugins.

## Step 3: Setting up the provider

Now that we have our plugin cleaned up, we can start adding our code. The boilerplate in the `src/HeadingsServiceProvider.php` file has a lot going on so, let's delete everything and start from scratch.

We need to be able to register our stylesheet with the Filament Asset Manager so that we can load it on demand in our Blade view. To do this, we'll need to add the following to the `packageBooted` method in our service provider.

***Note the `loadedOnRequest()` method. This is important, because it tells Filament to only load the stylesheet when it's needed.***

```php
namespace Awcodes\Headings;

use Filament\Support\Assets\Css;
use Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentAsset;
use Spatie\LaravelPackageTools\Package;
use Spatie\LaravelPackageTools\PackageServiceProvider;

class HeadingsServiceProvider extends PackageServiceProvider
{
    public static string $name = 'headings';

    public function configurePackage(Package $package): void
    {
        $package->name(static::$name)
            ->hasViews();
    }

    public function packageBooted(): void
    {
        FilamentAsset::register([
            Css::make('headings', __DIR__ . '/../resources/dist/headings.css')->loadedOnRequest(),
        ], 'awcodes/headings');
    }
}
```

## Step 4: Creating our component

Next, we'll need to create our component. Create a new file at `src/Heading.php` and add the following code.

```php
namespace Awcodes\Headings;

use Closure;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Component;
use Filament\Support\Colors\Color;
use Filament\Support\Concerns\HasColor;

class Heading extends Component
{
    use HasColor;

    protected string | int $level = 2;

    protected string | Closure $content = '';

    protected string $view = 'headings::heading';

    final public function __construct(string | int $level)
    {
        $this->level($level);
    }

    public static function make(string | int $level): static
    {
        return app(static::class, ['level' => $level]);
    }

    public function content(string | Closure $content): static
    {
        $this->content = $content;

        return $this;
    }

    public function level(string | int $level): static
    {
        $this->level = $level;

        return $this;
    }

    public function getColor(): array
    {
        return $this->evaluate($this->color) ?? Color::Amber;
    }

    public function getContent(): string
    {
        return $this->evaluate($this->content);
    }

    public function getLevel(): string
    {
        return is_int($this->level) ? 'h' . $this->level : $this->level;
    }
}
```

## Step 5: Rendering our component

Next, we'll need to create the view for our component. Create a new file at `resources/views/heading.blade.php` and add the following code.

We are using x-load to asynchronously load stylesheet, so it's only loaded when necessary. You can learn more about this in the [Core Concepts](../advanced/assets#lazy-loading-css) section of the docs.

```blade
@php
    $level = $getLevel();
    $color = $getColor();
@endphp

<{{ $level }}
    x-data
    x-load-css="[@js(\Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentAsset::getStyleHref('headings', package: 'awcodes/headings'))]"
    {{
        $attributes
            ->class([
                'headings-component',
                match ($color) {
                    'gray' => 'text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400',
                    default => 'text-custom-500',
                },
            ])
            ->style([
                \Filament\Support\get_color_css_variables($color, [500]) => $color !== 'gray',
            ])
    }}
>
    {{ $getContent() }}
</{{ $level }}>
```

## Step 6: Adding some styles

Next, let's provide some custom styling for our field. We'll add the following to `resources/css/index.css`. And run `npm run build` to compile our CSS.

```css
.headings-component {
    &:is(h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6) {
         font-weight: 700;
         letter-spacing: -.025em;
         line-height: 1.1;
     }

    &h1 {
         font-size: 2rem;
     }

    &h2 {
         font-size: 1.75rem;
     }

    &h3 {
         font-size: 1.5rem;
     }

    &h4 {
         font-size: 1.25rem;
     }

    &h5,
    &h6 {
         font-size: 1rem;
     }
}
```

Then we need to build our stylesheet.

```bash
npm run build
```

## Step 7: Update your README

You'll want to update your `README.md` file to include instructions on how to install your plugin and any other information you want to share with users, Like how to use it in their projects. For example:

```php
use Awcodes\Headings\Heading;

Heading::make(2)
    ->content('Product Information')
    ->color(Color::Lime),
```

And, that's it, our users can now install our plugin and use it in their projects.

import Aside from "@components/Aside.astro"

## Preface

Please read the docs on [panel plugin development](../plugins/panel-plugins) and the [getting started guide](getting-started) before continuing.

## Introduction

In this walkthrough, we'll build a simple plugin that adds a new form field that can be used in forms. This also means it will be available to users in their panels.

You can find the final code for this plugin at [https://github.com/awcodes/clock-widget](https://github.com/awcodes/clock-widget).

## Step 1: Create the plugin

First, we'll create the plugin using the steps outlined in the [getting started guide](getting-started#creating-a-plugin).

## Step 2: Clean up

Next, we'll clean up the plugin to remove the boilerplate code we don't need. This will seem like a lot, but since this is a simple plugin, we can remove a lot of the boilerplate code.

Remove the following directories and files:
1. `config`
1. `database`
1. `src/Commands`
1. `src/Facades`
1. `stubs`

Since our plugin doesn't have any settings or additional methods needed for functionality, we can also remove the `ClockWidgetPlugin.php` file.

1. `ClockWidgetPlugin.php`

Since Filament recommends that users style their plugins with a custom filament theme, we'll remove the files needed for using CSS in the plugin. This is optional, and you can still use CSS if you want, but it is not recommended.

1. `resources/css`
2. `postcss.config.js`

Now we can clean up our `composer.json` file to remove unneeded options.

```json
"autoload": {
    "psr-4": {
        // We can remove the database factories
        "Awcodes\ClockWidget\Database\Factories\": "database/factories/"
    }
},
"extra": {
    "laravel": {
        // We can remove the facade
        "aliases": {
            "ClockWidget": "Awcodes\ClockWidget\Facades\ClockWidget"
        }
    }
},
```

The last step is to update the `package.json` file to remove unneeded options. Replace the contents of `package.json` with the following.

```json
{
    "private": true,
    "type": "module",
    "scripts": {
        "dev": "node bin/build.js --dev",
        "build": "node bin/build.js"
    },
    "devDependencies": {
        "esbuild": "^0.17.19"
    }
}
```

Then we need to install our dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

You may also remove the Testing directories and files, but we'll leave them in for now, although we won't be using them for this example, and we highly recommend that you write tests for your plugins.

## Step 3: Setting up the provider

Now that we have our plugin cleaned up, we can start adding our code. The boilerplate in the `src/ClockWidgetServiceProvider.php` file has a lot going on so, let's delete everything and start from scratch.

<Aside variant="info">
    In this example, we will be registering an [async Alpine component](../advanced/assets#asynchronous-alpinejs-components). Since these assets are only loaded on request, we can register them as normal in the `packageBooted()` method. If you are registering assets, like CSS or JS files, that get loaded on every page regardless of if they are used or not, you should register them in the `register()` method of the `Plugin` configuration object, using [`$panel->assets()`](../panel-configuration#registering-assets-for-a-panel). Otherwise, if you register them in the `packageBooted()` method, they will be loaded in every panel, regardless of whether or not the plugin has been registered for that panel.
</Aside>

We need to be able to register our Widget with the panel and load our Alpine component when the widget is used. To do this, we'll need to add the following to the `packageBooted` method in our service provider. This will register our widget component with Livewire and our Alpine component with the Filament Asset Manager.

```php
use Filament\Support\Assets\AlpineComponent;
use Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentAsset;
use Livewire\Livewire;
use Spatie\LaravelPackageTools\Package;
use Spatie\LaravelPackageTools\PackageServiceProvider;

class ClockWidgetServiceProvider extends PackageServiceProvider
{
    public static string $name = 'clock-widget';

    public function configurePackage(Package $package): void
    {
        $package->name(static::$name)
            ->hasViews()
            ->hasTranslations();
    }

    public function packageBooted(): void
    {
        Livewire::component('clock-widget', ClockWidget::class);

        // Asset Registration
        FilamentAsset::register(
            assets:[
                 AlpineComponent::make('clock-widget', __DIR__ . '/../resources/dist/clock-widget.js'),
            ],
            package: 'awcodes/clock-widget'
        );
    }
}
```

## Step 4: Create the widget

Now we can create our widget. We'll first need to extend Filament's `Widget` class in our `ClockWidget.php` file and tell it where to find the view for the widget. Since we are using the PackageServiceProvider to register our views, we can use the `::` syntax to tell Filament where to find the view.

```php
use Filament\Widgets\Widget;

class ClockWidget extends Widget
{
    protected static string $view = 'clock-widget::widget';
}
```

Next, we'll need to create the view for our widget. Create a new file at `resources/views/widget.blade.php` and add the following code. We'll make use of Filament's Blade components to save time on writing the HTML for the widget.

We are using async Alpine to load our Alpine component, so we'll need to add the `x-load` attribute to the div to tell Alpine to load our component. You can learn more about this in the [Core Concepts](../advanced/assets#asynchronous-alpinejs-components) section of the docs.

```blade
<x-filament-widgets::widget>
    <x-filament::section>
        <x-slot name="heading">
            {{ __('clock-widget::clock-widget.title') }}
        </x-slot>

        <div
            x-load
            x-load-src="{{ \Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentAsset::getAlpineComponentSrc('clock-widget', 'awcodes/clock-widget') }}"
            x-data="clockWidget()"
            class="text-center"
        >
            <p>{{ __('clock-widget::clock-widget.description') }}</p>
            <p class="text-xl" x-text="time"></p>
        </div>
    </x-filament::section>
</x-filament-widgets::widget>
```

Next, we need to write our Alpine component in `src/js/index.js`. And build our assets with `npm run build`.

```js
export default function clockWidget() {
    return {
        time: new Date().toLocaleTimeString(),
        init() {
            setInterval(() => {
                this.time = new Date().toLocaleTimeString();
            }, 1000);
        }
    }
}
```

We should also add translations for the text in the widget so users can translate the widget into their language. We'll add the translations to `resources/lang/en/widget.php`.

```php
return [
    'title' => 'Clock Widget',
    'description' => 'Your current time is:',
];
```

## Step 5: Update your README

You'll want to update your `README.md` file to include instructions on how to install your plugin and any other information you want to share with users, Like how to use it in their projects. For example:

```php
// Register the plugin and/or Widget in your Panel provider:

use Awcodes\ClockWidget\ClockWidgetWidget;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        ->widgets([
            ClockWidgetWidget::class,
        ]);
}
```

And, that's it, our users can now install our plugin and use it in their projects.

## Introduction

While Filament comes with virtually any tool you'll need to build great apps, sometimes you'll need to add your own functionality either for just your app or as redistributable packages that other developers can include in their own apps. This is why Filament offers a plugin system that allows you to extend its functionality.

Before we dive in, it's important to understand the different contexts in which plugins can be used. There are two main contexts:

1. **Panel Plugins**: These are plugins that are used with [Panel Builders](../introduction/installation). They are typically used only to add functionality when used inside a Panel or as a complete Panel in and of itself. Examples of this are:
   1. A plugin that adds specific functionality to the dashboard in the form of Widgets.
   2. A plugin that adds a set of Resources / functionality to an app like a Blog or User Management feature.
2. **Standalone Plugins**: These are plugins that are used in any context outside a Panel Builder. Examples of this are:
   1. A plugin that adds custom fields to be used with the [Form Builders](../forms/overview).
   2. A plugin that adds custom columns or filters to the [Table Builders](../tables/overview).

Although these are two different mental contexts to keep in mind when building plugins, they can be used together inside the same plugin. They do not have to be mutually exclusive.

## Important concepts

Before we dive into the specifics of building plugins, there are a few concepts that are important to understand. You should familiarize yourself with the following before building a plugin:

1. [Laravel Package Development](https://laravel.com/docs/packages)
2. [Spatie Package Tools](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-package-tools)
3. [Filament Asset Management](../advanced/assets)

### The Plugin object

Filament introduces the concept of a Plugin object that is used to configure the plugin. This object is a simple PHP class that implements the `Filament\Contracts\Plugin` interface. This class is used to configure the plugin and is the main entry point for the plugin. It is also used to register Resources and Icons that might be used by your plugin.

While the plugin object is extremely helpful, it is not required to build a plugin. You can still build plugins without using the plugin object as you can see in the [building a panel plugin](building-a-panel-plugin) tutorial.

<Aside variant="info">
   The Plugin object is only used for Panel Providers. Standalone Plugins do not use this object. All configuration for Standalone Plugins should be handled in the plugin's service provider.
</Aside>

### Registering assets

All [asset registration](../advanced/assets), including CSS, JS and Alpine Components, should be done through the plugin's service provider in the `packageBooted()` method. This allows Filament to register the assets with the Asset Manager and load them when needed.

## Creating a plugin

While you can certainly build plugins from scratch, we recommend using the [Filament Plugin Skeleton](https://github.com/filamentphp/plugin-skeleton) to quickly get started. This skeleton includes all the necessary boilerplate to get you up and running quickly.

### Usage

To use the skeleton, simply go to the GitHub repo and click the "Use this template" button. This will create a new repo in your account with the skeleton code. After that, you can clone the repo to your machine. Once you have the code on your machine, navigate to the root of the project and run the following command:

```bash
php ./configure.php
```

This will ask you a series of questions to configure the plugin. Once you've answered all the questions, the script will stub out a new plugin for you, and you can begin to build your amazing new extension for Filament.

## Upgrading existing plugins

Since every plugin varies greatly in its scope of use and functionality, there is no one size fits all approaches to upgrading existing plugins. However, one thing to note, that is consistent to all plugins is the deprecation of the `PluginServiceProvider`.

In your plugin service provider, you will need to change it to extend the PackageServiceProvider instead. You will also need to add a static `$name` property to the service provider. This property is used to register the plugin with Filament. Here is an example of what your service provider might look like:

```php
class MyPluginServiceProvider extends PackageServiceProvider
{
    public static string $name = 'my-plugin';

    public function configurePackage(Package $package): void
    {
        $package->name(static::$name);
    }
}
```

## Introduction

The basis of Filament plugins are Laravel packages. They are installed into your Filament project via Composer, and follow all the standard techniques, like using service providers to register routes, views, and translations. If you're new to Laravel package development, here are some resources that can help you grasp the core concepts:

- [The Package Development section of the Laravel docs](https://laravel.com/docs/packages) serves as a great reference guide.
- [Spatie's Package Training course](https://spatie.be/products/laravel-package-training) is a good instructional video series to teach you the process step by step.
- [Spatie's Package Tools](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-package-tools) allows you to simplify your service provider classes using a fluent configuration object.

Filament plugins build on top of the concepts of Laravel packages and allow you to ship and consume reusable features for any Filament panel. They can be added to each panel one at a time, and are also configurable differently per-panel.

## Configuring the panel with a plugin class

A plugin class is used to allow your package to interact with a panel [configuration](../panel-configuration) file. It's a simple PHP class that implements the `Plugin` interface. 3 methods are required:

- The `getId()` method returns the unique identifier of the plugin amongst other plugins. Please ensure that it is specific enough to not clash with other plugins that might be used in the same project.
- The `register()` method allows you to use any [configuration](../panel-configuration) option that is available to the panel. This includes registering [resources](../resources/overview), [custom pages](../navigation/custom-pages), [themes](../styling/overview#creating-a-custom-theme), [render hooks](../panel-configuration#render-hooks) and more.
- The `boot()` method is run only when the panel that the plugin is being registered to is actually in-use. It is executed by a middleware class.

```php
<?php

namespace DanHarrin\FilamentBlog;

use DanHarrin\FilamentBlog\Pages\Settings;
use DanHarrin\FilamentBlog\Resources\CategoryResource;
use DanHarrin\FilamentBlog\Resources\PostResource;
use Filament\Contracts\Plugin;
use Filament\Panel;

class BlogPlugin implements Plugin
{
    public function getId(): string
    {
        return 'blog';
    }

    public function register(Panel $panel): void
    {
        $panel
            ->resources([
                PostResource::class,
                CategoryResource::class,
            ])
            ->pages([
                Settings::class,
            ]);
    }

    public function boot(Panel $panel): void
    {
        //
    }
}
```

The users of your plugin can add it to a panel by instantiating the plugin class and passing it to the `plugin()` method of the [configuration](../panel-configuration):

```php
use DanHarrin\FilamentBlog\BlogPlugin;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->plugin(new BlogPlugin());
}
```

### Fluently instantiating the plugin class

You may want to add a `make()` method to your plugin class to provide a fluent interface for your users to instantiate it. In addition, by using the container (`app()`) to instantiate the plugin object, it can be replaced with a different implementation at runtime:

```php
use Filament\Contracts\Plugin;

class BlogPlugin implements Plugin
{
    public static function make(): static
    {
        return app(static::class);
    }
    
    // ...
}
```

Now, your users can use the `make()` method:

```php
use DanHarrin\FilamentBlog\BlogPlugin;
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->plugin(BlogPlugin::make());
}
```

### Configuring plugins per-panel

You may add other methods to your plugin class, which allow your users to configure it. We suggest that you add both a setter and a getter method for each option you provide. You should use a property to store the preference in the setter and retrieve it again in the getter:

```php
use DanHarrin\FilamentBlog\Resources\AuthorResource;
use Filament\Contracts\Plugin;
use Filament\Panel;

class BlogPlugin implements Plugin
{
    protected bool $hasAuthorResource = false;
    
    public function authorResource(bool $condition = true): static
    {
        // This is the setter method, where the user's preference is
        // stored in a property on the plugin object.
        $this->hasAuthorResource = $condition;
    
        // The plugin object is returned from the setter method to
        // allow fluent chaining of configuration options.
        return $this;
    }
    
    public function hasAuthorResource(): bool
    {
        // This is the getter method, where the user's preference
        // is retrieved from the plugin property.
        return $this->hasAuthorResource;
    }
    
    public function register(Panel $panel): void
    {
        // Since the `register()` method is executed after the user
        // configures the plugin, you can access any of their
        // preferences inside it.
        if ($this->hasAuthorResource()) {
            // Here, we only register the author resource on the
            // panel if the user has requested it.
            $panel->resources([
                AuthorResource::class,
            ]);
        }
    }
    
    // ...
}
```

Additionally, you can use the unique ID of the plugin to access any of its configuration options from outside the plugin class. To do this, pass the ID to the `filament()` method:

```php
filament('blog')->hasAuthorResource()
```

You may wish to have better type safety and IDE autocompletion when accessing configuration. It's completely up to you how you choose to achieve this, but one idea could be adding a static method to the plugin class to retrieve it:

```php
use Filament\Contracts\Plugin;

class BlogPlugin implements Plugin
{
    public static function get(): static
    {
        return filament(app(static::class)->getId());
    }
    
    // ...
}
```

Now, you can access the plugin configuration using the new static method:

```php
BlogPlugin::get()->hasAuthorResource()
```

## Distributing a panel in a plugin

It's very easy to distribute an entire panel in a Laravel package. This way, a user can simply install your plugin and have an entirely new part of their app pre-built.

When [configuring](../panel-configuration) a panel, the configuration class extends the `PanelProvider` class, and that is a standard Laravel service provider. You can use it as a service provider in your package:

```php
<?php

namespace DanHarrin\FilamentBlog;

use Filament\Panel;
use Filament\PanelProvider;

class BlogPanelProvider extends PanelProvider
{
    public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
    {
        return $panel
            ->id('blog')
            ->path('blog')
            ->resources([
                // ...
            ])
            ->pages([
                // ...
            ])
            ->widgets([
                // ...
            ])
            ->middleware([
                // ...
            ])
            ->authMiddleware([
                // ...
            ]);
    }
}
```

You should then register it as a service provider in the `composer.json` of your package:

```json
"extra": {
    "laravel": {
        "providers": [
            "DanHarrin\FilamentBlog\BlogPanelProvider"
        ]
    }
}
```


=== .ai/03-avatar rules ===

---
title: Avatar Blade component
---

## Introduction

The avatar component is used to render a circular or square image, often used to represent a user or entity as their "profile picture":

```blade
<x-filament::avatar
    src="https://filamentphp.com/dan.jpg"
    alt="Dan Harrin"
/>
```

## Setting the rounding of an avatar

Avatars are fully rounded by default, but you may make them square by setting the `circular` attribute to `false`:

```blade
<x-filament::avatar
    src="https://filamentphp.com/dan.jpg"
    alt="Dan Harrin"
    :circular="false"
/>
```

## Setting the size of an avatar

By default, the avatar will be "medium" size. You can set the size to either `sm`, `md`, or `lg` using the `size` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::avatar
    src="https://filamentphp.com/dan.jpg"
    alt="Dan Harrin"
    size="lg"
/>
```

You can also pass your own custom size classes into the `size` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::avatar
    src="https://filamentphp.com/dan.jpg"
    alt="Dan Harrin"
    size="w-12 h-12"
/>


=== .ai/02-form rules ===

---
title: Rendering a form in a Blade view
---
import Aside from "@components/Aside.astro"

<Aside variant="warning">
    Before proceeding, make sure `filament/forms` is installed in your project. You can check by running:

    ```bash
    composer show filament/forms
    ```
    If it's not installed, consult the [installation guide](../introduction/installation#installing-the-individual-components) and configure the **individual components** according to the instructions.
</Aside>

## Setting up the Livewire component

First, generate a new Livewire component:

```bash
php artisan make:livewire CreatePost
```

Then, render your Livewire component on the page:

```blade
@livewire('create-post')
```

Alternatively, you can use a full-page Livewire component:

```php
use App\Livewire\CreatePost;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;

Route::get('posts/create', CreatePost::class);
```

## Adding the form

<Aside variant="warning">
    Before proceeding, please ensure that the **Forms package** is installed in your project. Consult the [installation guide](../introduction/installation#installing-the-individual-components) and configure the **individual components** according to the instructions.
</Aside>

There are 5 main tasks when adding a form to a Livewire component class. Each one is essential:

1) Implement the `HasSchemas` interface and use the `InteractsWithSchemas` trait.
2) Define a public Livewire property to store your form's data. In our example, we'll call this `$data`, but you can call it whatever you want.
3) Add a `form()` method, which is where you configure the form. [Add the form's schema](../forms/overview#form-schemas), and tell Filament to store the form data in the `$data` property (using `statePath('data')`).
4) Initialize the form with `$this->form->fill()` in `mount()`. This is imperative for every form that you build, even if it doesn't have any initial data.
5) Define a method to handle the form submission. In our example, we'll call this `create()`, but you can call it whatever you want. Inside that method, you can validate and get the form's data using `$this->form->getState()`. It's important that you use this method instead of accessing the `$this->data` property directly, because the form's data needs to be validated and transformed into a useful format before being returned.

```php
<?php

namespace App\Livewire;

use Filament\Forms\Components\MarkdownEditor;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Schemas\Concerns\InteractsWithSchemas;
use Filament\Schemas\Contracts\HasSchemas;
use Illuminate\Contracts\View\View;
use Filament\Schemas\Schema;
use Livewire\Component;

class CreatePost extends Component implements HasSchemas
{
    use InteractsWithSchemas;
    
    public ?array $data = [];
    
    public function mount(): void
    {
        $this->form->fill();
    }
    
    public function form(Schema $schema): Schema
    {
        return $schema
            ->components([
                TextInput::make('title')
                    ->required(),
                MarkdownEditor::make('content'),
                // ...
            ])
            ->statePath('data');
    }
    
    public function create(): void
    {
        dd($this->form->getState());
    }
    
    public function render(): View
    {
        return view('livewire.create-post');
    }
}
```

Finally, in your Livewire component's view, render the form:

```blade
<div>
    <form wire:submit="create">
        {{ $this->form }}
        
        <button type="submit">
            Submit
        </button>
    </form>
    
    <x-filament-actions::modals />
</div>
```

<Aside variant="info">
    `<x-filament-actions::modals />` is used to render form component [action modals](../actions/modals). The code can be put anywhere outside the `<form>` element, as long as it's within the Livewire component.
</Aside>

Visit your Livewire component in the browser, and you should see the form components from `components()`:

Submit the form with data, and you'll see the form's data dumped to the screen. You can save the data to a model instead of dumping it:

```php
use App\Models\Post;

public function create(): void
{
    Post::create($this->form->getState());
}
```

<Aside variant="info">
    `filament/forms` also includes the following packages:

    - `filament/actions`
    - `filament/schemas`
    - `filament/support`
    
    These packages allow you to use their components within Livewire components.
    For example, if your form uses [Actions](../actions), remember to implement the `HasActions` interface and use the `InteractsWithActions` trait on your Livewire component class.
    
    If you are using any other [Filament components](overview#package-components) in your form, make sure to install and integrate the corresponding package as well.
</Aside>

## Initializing the form with data

To fill the form with data, just pass that data to the `$this->form->fill()` method. For example, if you're editing an existing post, you might do something like this:

```php
use App\Models\Post;

public function mount(Post $post): void
{
    $this->form->fill($post->attributesToArray());
}
```

It's important that you use the `$this->form->fill()` method instead of assigning the data directly to the `$this->data` property. This is because the post's data needs to be internally transformed into a useful format before being stored.

## Setting a form model

Giving the `$form` access to a model is useful for a few reasons:

- It allows fields within that form to load information from that model. For example, select fields can [load their options from the database](../forms/select#integrating-with-an-eloquent-relationship) automatically.
- The form can load and save the model's relationship data automatically. For example, you have an Edit Post form, with a [Repeater](../forms/repeater#integrating-with-an-eloquent-relationship) which manages comments associated with that post. Filament will automatically load the comments for that post when you call `$this->form->fill([...])`, and save them back to the relationship when you call `$this->form->getState()`.
- Validation rules like `exists()` and `unique()` can automatically retrieve the database table name from the model.

It is advised to always pass the model to the form when there is one. As explained, it unlocks many new powers of Filament's form system.

To pass the model to the form, use the `$form->model()` method:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Schema;

public Post $post;

public function form(Schema $schema): Schema
{
    return $schema
        ->components([
            // ...
        ])
        ->statePath('data')
        ->model($this->post);
}
```

### Passing the form model after the form has been submitted

In some cases, the form's model is not available until the form has been submitted. For example, in a Create Post form, the post does not exist until the form has been submitted. Therefore, you can't pass it in to `$form->model()`. However, you can pass a model class instead:

```php
use App\Models\Post;
use Filament\Schemas\Schema;

public function form(Schema $schema): Schema
{
    return $schema
        ->components([
            // ...
        ])
        ->statePath('data')
        ->model(Post::class);
}
```

On its own, this isn't as powerful as passing a model instance. For example, relationships won't be saved to the post after it is created. To do that, you'll need to pass the post to the form after it has been created, and call `saveRelationships()` to save the relationships to it:

```php
use App\Models\Post;

public function create(): void
{
    $post = Post::create($this->form->getState());
    
    // Save the relationships from the form to the post after it is created.
    $this->form->model($post)->saveRelationships();
}
```

## Saving form data to individual properties

In all of our previous examples, we've been saving the form's data to the public `$data` property on the Livewire component. However, you can save the data to individual properties instead. For example, if you have a form with a `title` field, you can save the form's data to the `$title` property instead. To do this, don't pass a `statePath()` to the form at all. Ensure that all of your fields have their own **public** properties on the class.

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\MarkdownEditor;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Schemas\Schema;

public ?string $title = null;

public ?string $content = null;

public function form(Schema $schema): Schema
{
    return $schema
        ->components([
            TextInput::make('title')
                ->required(),
            MarkdownEditor::make('content'),
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

## Using multiple forms

Many forms can be defined using the `InteractsWithSchemas` trait. Each of the forms should use a method with the same name:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\MarkdownEditor;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Schemas\Schema;

public ?array $postData = [];

public ?array $commentData = [];

public function editPostForm(Schema $schema): Schema
{
    return $schema
        ->components([
            TextInput::make('title')
                ->required(),
            MarkdownEditor::make('content'),
            // ...
        ])
        ->statePath('postData')
        ->model($this->post);
}

public function createCommentForm(Schema $schema): Schema
{
    return $schema
        ->components([
            TextInput::make('name')
                ->required(),
            TextInput::make('email')
                ->email()
                ->required(),
            MarkdownEditor::make('content')
                ->required(),
            // ...
        ])
        ->statePath('commentData')
        ->model(Comment::class);
}
```

Now, each form is addressable by its name instead of `form`. For example, to fill the post form, you can use `$this->editPostForm->fill([...])`, or to get the data from the comment form you can use `$this->createCommentForm->getState()`.

You'll notice that each form has its own unique `statePath()`. Each form will write its state to a different array on your Livewire component, so it's important to define the public properties, `$postData` and `$commentData` in this example.

## Resetting a form's data

You can reset a form back to its default data at any time by calling `$this->form->fill()`. For example, you may wish to clear the contents of a form every time it's submitted:

```php
use App\Models\Comment;

public function createComment(): void
{
    Comment::create($this->form->getState());

    // Reinitialize the form to clear its data.
    $this->form->fill();
}
```

## Generating form Livewire components with the CLI

It's advised that you learn how to set up a Livewire component with forms manually, but once you are confident, you can use the CLI to generate a form for you.

```bash
php artisan make:filament-livewire-form RegistrationForm
```

This will generate a new `app/Livewire/RegistrationForm.php` component, which you can customize.

### Generating a form for an Eloquent model

Filament is also able to generate forms for a specific Eloquent model. These are more powerful, as they will automatically save the data in the form for you, and [ensure the form fields are properly configured](#setting-a-form-model) to access that model.

When generating a form with the `make:livewire-form` command, it will ask for the name of the model:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-livewire-form Products/CreateProduct
```

#### Generating an edit form for an Eloquent record

By default, passing a model to the `make:livewire-form` command will result in a form that creates a new record in your database. If you pass the `--edit` flag to the command, it will generate an edit form for a specific record. This will automatically fill the form with the data from the record, and save the data back to the model when the form is submitted.

```bash
php artisan make:filament-livewire-form Products/EditProduct --edit
```

### Automatically generating form schemas

Filament is also able to guess which form fields you want in the schema, based on the model's database columns. You can use the `--generate` flag when generating your form:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-livewire-form Products/CreateProduct --generate
```

title: Input Blade component
---

## Introduction

The input component is a wrapper around the native `<input>` element. It provides a simple interface for entering a single line of text.

```blade
<x-filament::input.wrapper>
    <x-filament::input
        type="text"
        wire:model="name"
    />
</x-filament::input.wrapper>
```

To use the input component, you must wrap it in an "input wrapper" component, which provides a border and other elements such as a prefix or suffix. You can learn more about customizing the input wrapper component [here](input-wrapper).


=== .ai/03-dropdown rules ===

---
title: Dropdown Blade component
---

## Introduction

The dropdown component allows you to render a dropdown menu with a button that triggers it:

```blade
<x-filament::dropdown>
    <x-slot name="trigger">
        <x-filament::button>
            More actions
        </x-filament::button>
    </x-slot>
    
    <x-filament::dropdown.list>
        <x-filament::dropdown.list.item wire:click="openViewModal">
            View
        </x-filament::dropdown.list.item>
        
        <x-filament::dropdown.list.item wire:click="openEditModal">
            Edit
        </x-filament::dropdown.list.item>
        
        <x-filament::dropdown.list.item wire:click="openDeleteModal">
            Delete
        </x-filament::dropdown.list.item>
    </x-filament::dropdown.list>
</x-filament::dropdown>
```

## Using a dropdown item as an anchor link

By default, a dropdown item's underlying HTML tag is `<button>`. You can change it to be an `<a>` tag by using the `tag` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::dropdown.list.item
    href="https://filamentphp.com"
    tag="a"
>
    Filament
</x-filament::dropdown.list.item>
```

## Changing the color of a dropdown item

By default, the color of a dropdown item is "gray". You can change it to be `danger`, `info`, `primary`, `success` or `warning` by using the `color` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::dropdown.list.item color="danger">
    Edit
</x-filament::dropdown.list.item>

<x-filament::dropdown.list.item color="info">
    Edit
</x-filament::dropdown.list.item>

<x-filament::dropdown.list.item color="primary">
    Edit
</x-filament::dropdown.list.item>

<x-filament::dropdown.list.item color="success">
    Edit
</x-filament::dropdown.list.item>

<x-filament::dropdown.list.item color="warning">
    Edit
</x-filament::dropdown.list.item>
```

## Adding an icon to a dropdown item

You can add an [icon](../styling/icons) to a dropdown item by using the `icon` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::dropdown.list.item icon="heroicon-m-pencil">
    Edit
</x-filament::dropdown.list.item>
```

### Changing the icon color of a dropdown item

By default, the icon color uses the [same color as the item itself](#changing-the-color-of-a-dropdown-item). You can override it to be `danger`, `info`, `primary`, `success` or `warning` by using the `icon-color` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::dropdown.list.item icon="heroicon-m-pencil" icon-color="danger">
    Edit
</x-filament::dropdown.list.item>

<x-filament::dropdown.list.item icon="heroicon-m-pencil" icon-color="info">
    Edit
</x-filament::dropdown.list.item>

<x-filament::dropdown.list.item icon="heroicon-m-pencil" icon-color="primary">
    Edit
</x-filament::dropdown.list.item>

<x-filament::dropdown.list.item icon="heroicon-m-pencil" icon-color="success">
    Edit
</x-filament::dropdown.list.item>

<x-filament::dropdown.list.item icon="heroicon-m-pencil" icon-color="warning">
    Edit
</x-filament::dropdown.list.item>
```

## Adding an image to a dropdown item

You can add a circular image to a dropdown item by using the `image` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::dropdown.list.item image="https://filamentphp.com/dan.jpg">
    Dan Harrin
</x-filament::dropdown.list.item>
```

## Adding a badge to a dropdown item

You can render a [badge](badge) on top of a dropdown item by using the `badge` slot:

```blade
<x-filament::dropdown.list.item>
    Mark notifications as read
    
    <x-slot name="badge">
        3
    </x-slot>
</x-filament::dropdown.list.item>
```

You can [change the color](badge#changing-the-color-of-the-badge) of the badge using the `badge-color` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::dropdown.list.item badge-color="danger">
    Mark notifications as read
    
    <x-slot name="badge">
        3
    </x-slot>
</x-filament::dropdown.list.item>
```

## Setting the placement of a dropdown

The dropdown may be positioned relative to the trigger button by using the `placement` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::dropdown placement="top-start">
    {{-- Dropdown items --}}
</x-filament::dropdown>
```

## Setting the width of a dropdown

The dropdown may be set to a width by using the `width` attribute. Options correspond to [Tailwind's max-width scale](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/max-width). The options are `xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`, `2xl`, `3xl`, `4xl`, `5xl`, `6xl` and `7xl`:

```blade
<x-filament::dropdown width="xs">
    {{-- Dropdown items --}}
</x-filament::dropdown>
```

## Controlling the maximum height of a dropdown

The dropdown content can have a maximum height using the `max-height` attribute, so that it scrolls. You can pass a [CSS length](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/length):

```blade
<x-filament::dropdown max-height="400px">
    {{-- Dropdown items --}}
</x-filament::dropdown>
```


=== .ai/02-widget rules ===

---
title: Rendering a widget in a Blade view
---
import Aside from "@components/Aside.astro"

<Aside variant="warning">
    Before proceeding, make sure `filament/widgets` is installed in your project. You can check by running:

    ```bash
    composer show filament/widgets
    ```
    If it's not installed, consult the [installation guide](../introduction/installation#installing-the-individual-components) and configure the **individual components** according to the instructions.
</Aside>

## Creating a widget

Use the `make:filament-widget` command to generate a new widget. For details on customization and usage, see the [widgets section](../widgets).

## Adding the widget

Since widgets are Livewire components, you can easily render a widget in any Blade view using the `@livewire` directive:

```blade
<div>
    @livewire(\App\Livewire\Dashboard\PostsChart::class)
</div>
```

<Aside variant="info">
    If you're using a [table widget](../widgets/overview#table-widgets), make sure to install `filament/tables` as well.  
    Refer to the [installation guide](../introduction/installation#installing-the-individual-components) and follow the steps to configure the **individual components** properly.
</Aside>


=== .ai/03-pagination rules ===

---
title: Pagination Blade component
---

## Introduction

The pagination component can be used in a Livewire Blade view only. It can render a list of paginated links:

```php
use App\Models\User;
use Illuminate\Contracts\View\View;
use Livewire\Component;

class ListUsers extends Component
{
    // ...
    
    public function render(): View
    {
        return view('livewire.list-users', [
            'users' => User::query()->paginate(10),
        ]);
    }
}
```

```blade
<x-filament::pagination :paginator="$users" />
```

Alternatively, you can use simple pagination or cursor pagination, which will just render a "previous" and "next" button:

```php
use App\Models\User;

User::query()->simplePaginate(10)
User::query()->cursorPaginate(10)
```

## Allowing the user to customize the number of items per page

You can allow the user to customize the number of items per page by passing an array of options to the `page-options` attribute. You must also define a Livewire property where the user's selection will be stored:

```php
use App\Models\User;
use Illuminate\Contracts\View\View;
use Livewire\Component;

class ListUsers extends Component
{
    public int | string $perPage = 10;
    
    // ...
    
    public function render(): View
    {
        return view('livewire.list-users', [
            'users' => User::query()->paginate($this->perPage),
        ]);
    }
}
```

```blade
<x-filament::pagination
    :paginator="$users"
    :page-options="[5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 'all']"
    current-page-option-property="perPage"
/>
```

## Displaying links to the first and the last page

Extreme links are the first and last page links. You can add them by passing the `extreme-links` attribute to the component:

```blade
<x-filament::pagination
    :paginator="$users"
    extreme-links
/>
```


=== .ai/03-fieldset rules ===

---
title: Fieldset Blade component
---

## Introduction

You can use a fieldset to group multiple form fields together, optionally with a label:

```blade
<x-filament::fieldset>
    <x-slot name="label">
        Address
    </x-slot>
    
    {{-- Form fields --}}
</x-filament::fieldset>
```


=== .ai/03-section rules ===

---
title: Section Blade component
---

## Introduction

A section can be used to group content together, with an optional heading:

```blade
<x-filament::section>
    <x-slot name="heading">
        User details
    </x-slot>

    {{-- Content --}}
</x-filament::section>
```

## Adding a description to the section

You can add a description below the heading to the section by using the `description` slot:

```blade
<x-filament::section>
    <x-slot name="heading">
        User details
    </x-slot>

    <x-slot name="description">
        This is all the information we hold about the user.
    </x-slot>

    {{-- Content --}}
</x-filament::section>
```

## Adding an icon to the section header

You can add an [icon](../styling/icons) to a section by using the `icon` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::section icon="heroicon-o-user">
    <x-slot name="heading">
        User details
    </x-slot>

    {{-- Content --}}
</x-filament::section>
```

### Changing the color of the section icon

By default, the color of the section icon is "gray". You can change it to be `danger`, `info`, `primary`, `success` or `warning` by using the `icon-color` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::section
    icon="heroicon-o-user"
    icon-color="info"
>
    <x-slot name="heading">
        User details
    </x-slot>

    {{-- Content --}}
</x-filament::section>
```

### Changing the size of the section icon

By default, the size of the section icon is "large". You can change it to be "small" or "medium" by using the `icon-size` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::section
    icon="heroicon-m-user"
    icon-size="sm"
>
    <x-slot name="heading">
        User details
    </x-slot>

    {{-- Content --}}
</x-filament::section>

<x-filament::section
    icon="heroicon-m-user"
    icon-size="md"
>
    <x-slot name="heading">
        User details
    </x-slot>

    {{-- Content --}}
</x-filament::section>
```

## Adding content to the end of the header

You may render additional content at the end of the header, next to the heading and description, using the `afterHeader` slot:

```blade
<x-filament::section>
    <x-slot name="heading">
        User details
    </x-slot>

    <x-slot name="afterHeader">
        {{-- Input to select the user's ID --}}
    </x-slot>

    {{-- Content --}}
</x-filament::section>
```

## Making a section collapsible

You can make the content of a section collapsible by using the `collapsible` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::section collapsible>
    <x-slot name="heading">
        User details
    </x-slot>

    {{-- Content --}}
</x-filament::section>
```

### Making a section collapsed by default

You can make a section collapsed by default by using the `collapsed` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::section
    collapsible
    collapsed
>
    <x-slot name="heading">
        User details
    </x-slot>

    {{-- Content --}}
</x-filament::section>
```

### Persisting collapsed sections

You can persist whether a section is collapsed in local storage using the `persist-collapsed` attribute, so it will remain collapsed when the user refreshes the page. You will also need a unique `id` attribute to identify the section from others, so that each section can persist its own collapse state:

```blade
<x-filament::section
    collapsible
    collapsed
    persist-collapsed
    id="user-details"
>
    <x-slot name="heading">
        User details
    </x-slot>

    {{-- Content --}}
</x-filament::section>
```

## Adding the section header aside the content instead of above it

You can change the position of the section header to be aside the content instead of above it by using the `aside` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::section aside>
    <x-slot name="heading">
        User details
    </x-slot>

    {{-- Content --}}
</x-filament::section>
```

### Positioning the content before the header

You can change the position of the content to be before the header instead of after it by using the `content-before` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::section
    aside
    content-before
>
    <x-slot name="heading">
        User details
    </x-slot>

    {{-- Content --}}
</x-filament::section>
```


=== .ai/03-breadcrumbs rules ===

---
title: Breadcrumbs Blade component

```blade
<x-filament::button icon="heroicon-m-sparkles">
    New user
</x-filament::button>
```

You can also change the icon's position to be after the text instead of before it, using the `icon-position` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::button
    icon="heroicon-m-sparkles"
    icon-position="after"
>
    New user
</x-filament::button>
```

## Making a button outlined

<x-filament::button outlined>
    New user
</x-filament::button>
```

## Adding a tooltip to a button

You can add a tooltip to a button by using the `tooltip` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::button tooltip="Register a user">
    New user
</x-filament::button>
```

## Adding a badge to a button

You can render a [badge](badge) on top of a button by using the `badge` slot:

```blade
<x-filament::button>
    Mark notifications as read
    
    <x-slot name="badge">
        3
    </x-slot>
</x-filament::button>
```

You can [change the color](badge#changing-the-color-of-the-badge) of the badge using the `badge-color` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::button badge-color="danger">
    Mark notifications as read
    
    <x-slot name="badge">
        3
    </x-slot>
</x-filament::button>
```


=== .ai/03-select rules ===

---
title: Select Blade component
---

## Introduction

The select component is a wrapper around the native `<select>` element. It provides a simple interface for selecting a single value from a list of options:

```blade
<x-filament::input.wrapper>
    <x-filament::input.select wire:model="status">
        <option value="draft">Draft</option>
        <option value="reviewing">Reviewing</option>
        <option value="published">Published</option>
    </x-filament::input.select>
</x-filament::input.wrapper>
```

To use the select component, you must wrap it in an "input wrapper" component, which provides a border and other elements such as a prefix or suffix. You can learn more about customizing the input wrapper component [here](input-wrapper).


=== .ai/03-badge rules ===

---
title: Badge Blade component

</x-filament::badge>

<x-filament::badge size="sm">
    New
</x-filament::badge>
```

## Changing the color of the badge

By default, the color of a badge is "primary". You can change it to be `danger`, `gray`, `info`, `success` or `warning` by using the `color` attribute:

```blade

    New
</x-filament::badge>

<x-filament::badge color="gray">
    New
</x-filament::badge>

<x-filament::badge color="info">
    New
</x-filament::badge>

<x-filament::badge color="success">
    New
</x-filament::badge>

<x-filament::badge color="warning">

    New
</x-filament::badge>
```

You can also change the icon's position to be after the text instead of before it, using the `icon-position` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::badge
    icon="heroicon-m-sparkles"
    icon-position="after"
>
    New
</x-filament::badge>
```


=== .ai/03-empty-state rules ===

---
title: Empty State Blade component
---

## Introduction

An empty state can be used to communicate that there is no content to display yet, and to guide the user towards the next action. A heading is required:

```blade
<x-filament::empty-state>
    <x-slot name="heading">
        No users yet
    </x-slot>
</x-filament::empty-state>
```

## Adding a description to the empty state

You can add a description below the heading to the empty state by using the `description` slot:

```blade
<x-filament::empty-state>
    <x-slot name="heading">
        No users yet
    </x-slot>

    <x-slot name="description">
        Get started by creating a new user.
    </x-slot>
</x-filament::empty-state>
```

## Adding an icon to the empty state

You can add an [icon](../styling/icons) to an empty state by using the `icon` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::empty-state
    icon="heroicon-o-user"
>
    <x-slot name="heading">
        No users yet
    </x-slot>
</x-filament::empty-state>
```

### Changing the color of the empty state icon

By default, the color of the empty state icon is `primary`. You can change it to be `gray`, `danger`, `info`, `success` or `warning` by using the `icon-color` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::empty-state
    icon="heroicon-o-user"
    icon-color="info"
>
    <x-slot name="heading">
        No users yet
    </x-slot>
</x-filament::empty-state>
```

### Changing the size of the empty state icon

By default, the size of the empty state icon is "large". You can change it to be "small" or "medium" by using the `icon-size` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::empty-state
    icon="heroicon-m-user"
    icon-size="sm"
>
    <x-slot name="heading">
        No users yet
    </x-slot>
</x-filament::empty-state>

<x-filament::empty-state
    icon="heroicon-m-user"
    icon-size="md"
>
    <x-slot name="heading">
        No users yet
    </x-slot>
</x-filament::empty-state>
```


## Adding footer actions to the empty state

You can add actions below the description by using the `footer` slot. This is useful for placing buttons, like the [`<x-filament::button>`](button) component:

```blade
<x-filament::empty-state>
    <x-slot name="heading">
        No users yet
    </x-slot>
    
    <x-slot name="footer">
        <x-filament::button icon="heroicon-m-plus">
            Create user
        </x-filament::button>
    </x-slot>
</x-filament::empty-state>
```


=== .ai/03-modal rules ===

---
title: Modal Blade component
---

## Introduction

The modal component is able to open a dialog window or slide-over with any content:

```blade
<x-filament::modal>
    <x-slot name="trigger">
        <x-filament::button>
            Open modal
        </x-filament::button>
    </x-slot>

    {{-- Modal content --}}
</x-filament::modal>
```

## Controlling a modal from JavaScript

You can use the `trigger` slot to render a button that opens the modal. However, this is not required. You have complete control over when the modal opens and closes through JavaScript. First, give the modal an ID so that you can reference it:

```blade
<x-filament::modal id="edit-user">
    {{-- Modal content --}}
</x-filament::modal>
```

Now, you can dispatch an `open-modal` or `close-modal` browser event, passing the modal's ID, which will open or close the modal. For example, from a Livewire component:

```php
$this->dispatch('open-modal', id: 'edit-user');
```

Or from Alpine.js:

```php
$dispatch('open-modal', { id: 'edit-user' })
```

## Adding a heading to a modal

You can add a heading to a modal by using the `heading` slot:

```blade
<x-filament::modal>
    <x-slot name="heading">
        Modal heading
    </x-slot>

    {{-- Modal content --}}
</x-filament::modal>
```

## Adding a description to a modal

You can add a description, below the heading, to a modal by using the `description` slot:

```blade
<x-filament::modal>
    <x-slot name="heading">
        Modal heading
    </x-slot>

    <x-slot name="description">
        Modal description
    </x-slot>

    {{-- Modal content --}}
</x-filament::modal>
```

## Adding an icon to a modal

You can add an [icon](../styling/icons) to a modal by using the `icon` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::modal icon="heroicon-o-information-circle">
    <x-slot name="heading">
        Modal heading
    </x-slot>

    {{-- Modal content --}}
</x-filament::modal>
```

By default, the color of an icon is "primary". You can change it to be `danger`, `gray`, `info`, `success` or `warning` by using the `icon-color` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::modal
    icon="heroicon-o-exclamation-triangle"
    icon-color="danger"
>
    <x-slot name="heading">
        Modal heading
    </x-slot>

    {{-- Modal content --}}
</x-filament::modal>
```

## Adding a footer to a modal

You can add a footer to a modal by using the `footer` slot:

```blade
<x-filament::modal>
    {{-- Modal content --}}
    
    <x-slot name="footer">
        {{-- Modal footer content --}}
    </x-slot>
</x-filament::modal>
```

Alternatively, you can add actions into the footer by using the `footerActions` slot:

```blade
<x-filament::modal>
    {{-- Modal content --}}
    
    <x-slot name="footerActions">
        {{-- Modal footer actions --}}
    </x-slot>
</x-filament::modal>
```

## Changing the modal's alignment

By default, modal content will be aligned to the start, or centered if the modal is `xs` or `sm` in [width](#changing-the-modal-width). If you wish to change the alignment of content in a modal, you can use the `alignment` attribute and pass it `start` or `center`:

```blade
<x-filament::modal alignment="center">
    {{-- Modal content --}}
</x-filament::modal>
```

## Using a slide-over instead of a modal

You can open a "slide-over" dialog instead of a modal by using the `slide-over` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::modal slide-over>
    {{-- Slide-over content --}}
</x-filament::modal>
```

## Making the modal header sticky

The header of a modal scrolls out of view with the modal content when it overflows the modal size. However, slide-overs have a sticky modal that's always visible. You may control this behavior using the `sticky-header` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::modal sticky-header>
    <x-slot name="heading">
        Modal heading
    </x-slot>

    {{-- Modal content --}}
</x-filament::modal>
```

## Making the modal footer sticky

The footer of a modal is rendered inline after the content by default. Slide-overs, however, have a sticky footer that always shows when scrolling the content. You may enable this for a modal too using the `sticky-footer` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::modal sticky-footer>
    {{-- Modal content --}}
    
    <x-slot name="footer">
        {{-- Modal footer content --}}
    </x-slot>
</x-filament::modal>
```

## Changing the modal width

You can change the width of the modal by using the `width` attribute. Options correspond to [Tailwind's max-width scale](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/max-width). The options are `xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`, `2xl`, `3xl`, `4xl`, `5xl`, `6xl`, `7xl`, and `screen`:

```blade
<x-filament::modal width="5xl">
    {{-- Modal content --}}
</x-filament::modal>
```

## Closing the modal by clicking away

By default, when you click away from a modal, it will close itself. If you wish to disable this behavior for a specific action, you can use the `close-by-clicking-away` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::modal :close-by-clicking-away="false">
    {{-- Modal content --}}
</x-filament::modal>
```

## Closing the modal by escaping

By default, when you press escape on a modal, it will close itself. If you wish to disable this behavior for a specific action, you can use the `close-by-escaping` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::modal :close-by-escaping="false">
    {{-- Modal content --}}
</x-filament::modal>
```

## Hiding the modal close button

By default, modals with a header have a close button in the top right corner. You can remove the close button from the modal by using the `close-button` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::modal :close-button="false">
    <x-slot name="heading">
        Modal heading
    </x-slot>

    {{-- Modal content --}}
</x-filament::modal>
```

## Preventing the modal from autofocusing

By default, modals will autofocus on the first focusable element when opened. If you wish to disable this behavior, you can use the `autofocus` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::modal :autofocus="false">
    {{-- Modal content --}}
</x-filament::modal>
```

## Disabling the modal trigger button

By default, the trigger button will open the modal even if it is disabled, since the click event listener is registered on a wrapping element of the button itself. If you want to prevent the modal from opening, you should also use the `disabled` attribute on the trigger slot:

```blade
<x-filament::modal>
    <x-slot name="trigger" disabled>
        <x-filament::button :disabled="true">
            Open modal
        </x-filament::button>
    </x-slot>
    {{-- Modal content --}}
</x-filament::modal>
```


=== .ai/02-table rules ===

---
title: Rendering a table in a Blade view
---
import Aside from "@components/Aside.astro"

<Aside variant="warning">
    Before proceeding, make sure `filament/tables` is installed in your project. You can check by running:

    ```bash
    composer show filament/tables
    ```
    If it's not installed, consult the [installation guide](../introduction/installation#installing-the-individual-components) and configure the **individual components** according to the instructions.
</Aside>

## Setting up the Livewire component

First, generate a new Livewire component:

```bash
php artisan make:livewire ListProducts
```

Then, render your Livewire component on the page:

```blade
@livewire('list-products')
```

Alternatively, you can use a full-page Livewire component:

```php
use App\Livewire\ListProducts;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;

Route::get('products', ListProducts::class);
```

## Adding the table

There are 3 tasks when adding a table to a Livewire component class:

1) Implement the `HasTable` and `HasSchemas` interfaces, and use the `InteractsWithTable` and `InteractsWithSchemas` traits.
2) Add a `table()` method, which is where you configure the table. [Add the table's columns, filters, and actions](../tables/overview#columns).
3) Make sure to define the base query that will be used to fetch rows in the table. For example, if you're listing products from your `Product` model, you will want to return `Product::query()`.

```php
<?php

namespace App\Livewire;

use App\Models\Shop\Product;
use Filament\Actions\Concerns\InteractsWithActions;  
use Filament\Actions\Contracts\HasActions;
use Filament\Schemas\Concerns\InteractsWithSchemas;
use Filament\Schemas\Contracts\HasSchemas;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;
use Filament\Tables\Concerns\InteractsWithTable;
use Filament\Tables\Contracts\HasTable;
use Filament\Tables\Table;
use Illuminate\Contracts\View\View;
use Livewire\Component;

class ListProducts extends Component implements HasActions, HasSchemas, HasTable
{
    use InteractsWithActions;
    use InteractsWithSchemas;
    use InteractsWithTable;
    
    public function table(Table $table): Table
    {
        return $table
            ->query(Product::query())
            ->columns([
                TextColumn::make('name'),
            ])
            ->filters([
                // ...
            ])
            ->recordActions([
                // ...
            ])
            ->toolbarActions([
                // ...
            ]);
    }
    
    public function render(): View
    {
        return view('livewire.list-products');
    }
}
```

Finally, in your Livewire component's view, render the table:

```blade
<div>
    {{ $this->table }}
</div>
```

Visit your Livewire component in the browser, and you should see the table.

<Aside variant="info">

    `filament/tables` also includes the following packages:
    
    - `filament/actions`
    - `filament/forms`
    - `filament/support`
    
    These packages allow you to use their components within Livewire components.
    For example, if your table uses [Actions](action#setting-up-the-livewire-component), remember to implement the `HasActions` interface and include the `InteractsWithActions` trait.
    
    If you are using any other [Filament components](overview#package-components) in your table, make sure to install and integrate the corresponding package as well.
</Aside>

## Building a table for an Eloquent relationship

If you want to build a table for an Eloquent relationship, you can use the `relationship()` and `inverseRelationship()` methods on the `$table` instead of passing a `query()`. `HasMany`, `HasManyThrough`, `BelongsToMany`, `MorphMany` and `MorphToMany` relationships are compatible:

```php
use App\Models\Category;
use Filament\Tables\Table;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\BelongsToMany;

public Category $category;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->relationship(fn (): BelongsToMany => $this->category->products())
        ->inverseRelationship('categories')
        ->columns([
            TextColumn::make('name'),
        ]);
}
```

In this example, we have a `$category` property which holds a `Category` model instance. The category has a relationship named `products`. We use a function to return the relationship instance. This is a many-to-many relationship, so the inverse relationship is called `categories`, and is defined on the `Product` model. We just need to pass the name of this relationship to the `inverseRelationship()` method, not the whole instance.

Now that the table is using a relationship instead of a plain Eloquent query, all actions will be performed on the relationship instead of the query. For example, if you use a [`CreateAction`](../actions/create), the new product will be automatically attached to the category.

If your relationship uses a pivot table, you can use all pivot columns as if they were normal columns on your table, as long as they are listed in the `withPivot()` method of the relationship *and* inverse relationship definition.

Relationship tables are used in the Panel Builder as ["relation managers"](../resources/managing-relationships#creating-a-relation-manager). Most of the documented features for relation managers are also available for relationship tables. For instance, [attaching and detaching](../resources/managing-relationships#attaching-and-detaching-records) and [associating and dissociating](../resources/managing-relationships#associating-and-dissociating-records) actions.

## Generating table Livewire components with the CLI

It's advised that you learn how to set up a Livewire component with the Table Builder manually, but once you are confident, you can use the CLI to generate a table for you.

```bash
php artisan make:livewire-table Products/ListProducts
```

This will ask you for the name of a prebuilt model, for example `Product`. Finally, it will generate a new `app/Livewire/Products/ListProducts.php` component, which you can customize.

### Automatically generating table columns

Filament is also able to guess which table columns you want in the table, based on the model's database columns. You can use the `--generate` flag when generating your table:

```bash
php artisan make:livewire-table Products/ListProducts --generate
```


=== .ai/02-notifications rules ===

---
title: Rendering notifications outside of a panel
---
import Aside from "@components/Aside.astro"

<Aside variant="warning">
    Before proceeding, make sure `filament/notifications` is installed in your project. You can check by running:

    ```bash
    composer show filament/notifications
    ```
    If it's not installed, consult the [installation guide](../introduction/installation#installing-the-individual-components) and configure the **individual components** according to the instructions.
</Aside>
## Introduction

To render notifications in your app, make sure the `notifications` Livewire component is rendered in your layout:

```blade
<div>
    @livewire('notifications')
</div>
```

Now, when [sending a notification](../notifications) from a Livewire request, it will appear for the user.


=== .ai/03-loading-indicator rules ===

---
title: Loading indicator Blade component
---

## Introduction

The loading indicator is an animated SVG that can be used to indicate that something is in progress:

```blade
<x-filament::loading-indicator class="h-5 w-5" />
```


=== .ai/02-infolist rules ===

---
title: Rendering an infolist in a Blade view
---
import Aside from "@components/Aside.astro"

<Aside variant="warning">
    Before proceeding, make sure `filament/infolists` is installed in your project. You can check by running:

    ```bash
    composer show filament/infolists
    ```
    If it's not installed, consult the [installation guide](../introduction/installation#installing-the-individual-components) and configure the **individual components** according to the instructions.
</Aside>

## Setting up the Livewire component

First, generate a new Livewire component:

```bash
php artisan make:livewire ViewProduct
```

Then, render your Livewire component on the page:

```blade
@livewire('view-product')
```

Alternatively, you can use a full-page Livewire component:

```php
use App\Livewire\ViewProduct;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;

Route::get('products/{product}', ViewProduct::class);
```

You must use the `InteractsWithSchemas` trait, and implement the `HasSchemas` interface on your Livewire component class:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Concerns\InteractsWithSchemas;
use Filament\Schemas\Contracts\HasSchemas;
use Livewire\Component;

class ViewProduct extends Component implements HasSchemas
{
    use InteractsWithSchemas;

    // ...
}
```

## Adding the infolist

Next, add a method to the Livewire component which accepts an `$infolist` object, modifies it, and returns it:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Schema;

public function productInfolist(Schema $schema): Schema
{
    return $schema
        ->record($this->product)
        ->components([
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

Finally, render the infolist in the Livewire component's view:

```blade
{{ $this->productInfolist }}
```

<Aside variant="info">
    `filament/infolists` also includes the following packages:

    - `filament/actions`
    - `filament/schemas`
    - `filament/support`
    
    These packages allow you to use their components within Livewire components.
    For example, if your infolist uses [Actions](../actions), remember to implement the `HasActions` interface and use the `InteractsWithActions` trait on your Livewire component class.
    
    If you are using any other [Filament components](overview#package-components) in your infolist, make sure to install and integrate the corresponding package as well.

</Aside>

## Passing data to the infolist

You can pass data to the infolist in two ways:

Either pass an Eloquent model instance to the `record()` method of the infolist, to automatically map all the model attributes and relationships to the entries in the infolist's schema:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;
use Filament\Schemas\Schema;

public function productInfolist(Schema $schema): Schema
{
    return $schema
        ->record($this->product)
        ->components([
            TextEntry::make('name'),
            TextEntry::make('category.name'),
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

Alternatively, you can pass an array of data to the `state()` method of the infolist, to manually map the data to the entries in the infolist's schema:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;
use Filament\Schemas\Schema;

public function productInfolist(Schema $schema): Schema
{
    return $schema
        ->constantState([
            'name' => 'MacBook Pro',
            'category' => [
                'name' => 'Laptops',
            ],
            // ...
        ])
        ->components([
            TextEntry::make('name'),
            TextEntry::make('category.name'),
            // ...
        ]);
}
```


=== .ai/03-input-wrapper rules ===

---
title: Input wrapper Blade component
---

## Introduction

The input wrapper component should be used as a wrapper around the [input](input) or [select](select) components. It provides a border and other elements such as a prefix or suffix.

```blade
<x-filament::input.wrapper>
    <x-filament::input
        type="text"
        wire:model="name"
    />
</x-filament::input.wrapper>

<x-filament::input.wrapper>
    <x-filament::input.select wire:model="status">
        <option value="draft">Draft</option>
        <option value="reviewing">Reviewing</option>
        <option value="published">Published</option>
    </x-filament::input.select>
</x-filament::input.wrapper>
```

## Triggering the error state of the input

The component has special styling that you can use if it is invalid. To trigger this styling, you can use either Blade or Alpine.js.

To trigger the error state using Blade, you can pass the `valid` attribute to the component, which contains either true or false based on if the input is valid or not:

```blade
<x-filament::input.wrapper :valid="! $errors->has('name')">
    <x-filament::input
        type="text"
        wire:model="name"
    />
</x-filament::input.wrapper>
```

Alternatively, you can use an Alpine.js expression to trigger the error state, based on if it evaluates to `true` or `false`:

```blade
<div x-data="{ errors: ['name'] }">
    <x-filament::input.wrapper alpine-valid="! errors.includes('name')">
        <x-filament::input
            type="text"
            wire:model="name"
        />
    </x-filament::input.wrapper>
</div>
```

## Disabling the input

To disable the input, you must also pass the `disabled` attribute to the wrapper component:

```blade
<x-filament::input.wrapper disabled>
    <x-filament::input
        type="text"
        wire:model="name"
        disabled
    />
</x-filament::input.wrapper>
```

## Adding affix text aside the input

You may place text before and after the input using the `prefix` and `suffix` slots:

```blade
<x-filament::input.wrapper>
    <x-slot name="prefix">
        https://
    </x-slot>

    <x-filament::input
        type="text"
        wire:model="domain"
    />

    <x-slot name="suffix">
        .com
    </x-slot>
</x-filament::input.wrapper>
```

### Using icons as affixes

You may place an [icon](../styling/icons) before and after the input using the `prefix-icon` and `suffix-icon` attributes:

```blade
<x-filament::input.wrapper suffix-icon="heroicon-m-globe-alt">
    <x-filament::input
        type="url"
        wire:model="domain"
    />
</x-filament::input.wrapper>
```

#### Setting the affix icon's color

Affix icons are gray by default, but you may set a different color using the `prefix-icon-color` and `affix-icon-color` attributes:

```blade
<x-filament::input.wrapper
    suffix-icon="heroicon-m-check-circle"
    suffix-icon-color="success"
>
    <x-filament::input
        type="url"
        wire:model="domain"
    />
</x-filament::input.wrapper>
```


=== .ai/03-icon-button rules ===

---
title: Icon button Blade component
---

## Introduction

The button component is used to render a clickable button that can perform an action:

```blade
<x-filament::icon-button
    icon="heroicon-m-plus"
    wire:click="openNewUserModal"
    label="New label"
/>
```

## Using an icon button as an anchor link

By default, an icon button's underlying HTML tag is `<button>`. You can change it to be an `<a>` tag by using the `tag` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::icon-button
    icon="heroicon-m-arrow-top-right-on-square"
    href="https://filamentphp.com"
    tag="a"
    label="Filament"
/>
```

## Setting the size of an icon button

By default, the size of an icon button is "medium". You can make it "extra small", "small", "large" or "extra large" by using the `size` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::icon-button
    icon="heroicon-m-plus"
    size="xs"
    label="New label"
/>

<x-filament::icon-button
    icon="heroicon-m-plus"
    size="sm"
    label="New label"
/>

<x-filament::icon-button
    icon="heroicon-s-plus"
    size="lg"
    label="New label"
/>

<x-filament::icon-button
    icon="heroicon-s-plus"
    size="xl"
    label="New label"
/>
```

## Changing the color of an icon button

By default, the color of an icon button is "primary". You can change it to be `danger`, `gray`, `info`, `success` or `warning` by using the `color` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::icon-button
    icon="heroicon-m-plus"
    color="danger"
    label="New label"
/>

<x-filament::icon-button
    icon="heroicon-m-plus"
    color="gray"
    label="New label"
/>

<x-filament::icon-button
    icon="heroicon-m-plus"
    color="info"
    label="New label"
/>

<x-filament::icon-button
    icon="heroicon-m-plus"
    color="success"
    label="New label"
/>

<x-filament::icon-button
    icon="heroicon-m-plus"
    color="warning"
    label="New label"
/>
```

## Adding a tooltip to an icon button

You can add a tooltip to an icon button by using the `tooltip` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::icon-button
    icon="heroicon-m-plus"
    tooltip="Register a user"
    label="New label"
/>
```

## Adding a badge to an icon button

You can render a [badge](badge) on top of an icon button by using the `badge` slot:

```blade
<x-filament::icon-button
    icon="heroicon-m-x-mark"
    label="Mark notifications as read"
>
    <x-slot name="badge">
        3
    </x-slot>
</x-filament::icon-button>
```

You can [change the color](badge#changing-the-color-of-the-badge) of the badge using the `badge-color` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::icon-button
    icon="heroicon-m-x-mark"
    label="Mark notifications as read"
    badge-color="danger"
>
    <x-slot name="badge">
        3
    </x-slot>
</x-filament::icon-button>
```


=== .ai/03-tabs rules ===

---
title: Tabs Blade component
---

## Introduction

The tabs component allows you to render a set of tabs, which can be used to toggle between multiple sections of content:

```blade
<x-filament::tabs label="Content tabs">
    <x-filament::tabs.item>
        Tab 1
    </x-filament::tabs.item>

    <x-filament::tabs.item>
        Tab 2
    </x-filament::tabs.item>

    <x-filament::tabs.item>
        Tab 3
    </x-filament::tabs.item>
</x-filament::tabs>
```

## Triggering the active state of the tab

By default, tabs do not appear "active". To make a tab appear active, you can use the `active` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::tabs>
    <x-filament::tabs.item active>
        Tab 1
    </x-filament::tabs.item>

    {{-- Other tabs --}}
</x-filament::tabs>
```

You can also use the `active` attribute to make a tab appear active conditionally:

```blade
<x-filament::tabs>
    <x-filament::tabs.item
        :active="$activeTab === 'tab1'"
        wire:click="$set('activeTab', 'tab1')"
    >
        Tab 1
    </x-filament::tabs.item>

    {{-- Other tabs --}}
</x-filament::tabs>
```

Or you can use the `alpine-active` attribute to make a tab appear active conditionally using Alpine.js:

```blade
<x-filament::tabs x-data="{ activeTab: 'tab1' }">
    <x-filament::tabs.item
        alpine-active="activeTab === 'tab1'"
        x-on:click="activeTab = 'tab1'"
    >
        Tab 1
    </x-filament::tabs.item>

    {{-- Other tabs --}}
</x-filament::tabs>
```

## Setting a tab icon

Tabs may have an [icon](../styling/icons), which you can set using the `icon` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::tabs>
    <x-filament::tabs.item icon="heroicon-m-bell">
        Notifications
    </x-filament::tabs.item>

    {{-- Other tabs --}}
</x-filament::tabs>
```

### Setting the tab icon position

The icon of the tab may be positioned before or after the label using the `icon-position` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::tabs>
    <x-filament::tabs.item
        icon="heroicon-m-bell"
        icon-position="after"
    >
        Notifications
    </x-filament::tabs.item>

    {{-- Other tabs --}}
</x-filament::tabs>
```

## Setting a tab badge

Tabs may have a [badge](badge), which you can set using the `badge` slot:

```blade
<x-filament::tabs>
    <x-filament::tabs.item>
        Notifications

        <x-slot name="badge">
            5
        </x-slot>
    </x-filament::tabs.item>

    {{-- Other tabs --}}
</x-filament::tabs>
```

## Using a tab as an anchor link

By default, a tab's underlying HTML tag is `<button>`. You can change it to be an `<a>` tag by using the `tag` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::tabs>
    <x-filament::tabs.item
        :href="route('notifications')"
        tag="a"
    >
        Notifications
    </x-filament::tabs.item>

    {{-- Other tabs --}}
</x-filament::tabs>
```

## Using vertical tabs

You can render the tabs vertically by using the `vertical` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::tabs vertical>
    <x-filament::tabs.item>
        Tab 1
    </x-filament::tabs.item>

    <x-filament::tabs.item>
        Tab 2
    </x-filament::tabs.item>

    <x-filament::tabs.item>
        Tab 3
    </x-filament::tabs.item>
</x-filament::tabs>
```


=== .ai/01-overview rules ===

---
title: Overview
---

## Introduction

Filament packages consume a set of core components that aim to provide a consistent and maintainable foundation for all interfaces. Some of these components are also available for use in your own applications and Filament plugins.

## Package components

The various packages in the Filament project can be used outside of a panel:

- [Action](action)
- [Form](form)
- [Infolist](infolist)
- [Notifications](notifications)
- [Schema](schema)
- [Table](table)
- [Widget](widget)

## Blade components

Aside from the core packages, all Filament projects can also consume the Blade components that Filament uses internally:

- [Avatar](avatar)
- [Badge](badge)
- [Button](button)
- [Breadcrumbs](breadcrumbs)
- [Checkbox](checkbox)
- [Dropdown](dropdown)
- [Empty state](empty-state)
- [Fieldset](fieldset)
- [Icon button](icon-button)
- [Input](input)
- [Input wrapper](input-wrapper)
- [Link](link)
- [Loading indicator](loading-indicator)
- [Modal](modal)
- [Pagination](pagination)
- [Section](section)
- [Select](select)
- [Tabs](tabs)


=== .ai/02-action rules ===

---
title: Rendering an action in a Livewire component
---
import Aside from "@components/Aside.astro"

<Aside variant="warning">
    Before proceeding, make sure `filament/actions` is installed in your project. You can check by running:

    ```bash
    composer show filament/actions
    ```
    If it's not installed, consult the [installation guide](../introduction/installation#installing-the-individual-components) and configure the **individual components** according to the instructions.
</Aside>

## Setting up the Livewire component

First, generate a new Livewire component:

```bash
php artisan make:livewire ManagePost
```

Then, render your Livewire component on the page:

```blade
@livewire('manage-post')
```

Alternatively, you can use a full-page Livewire component:

```php
use App\Livewire\ManagePost;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;

Route::get('posts/{post}/manage', ManagePost::class);
```

You must use the `InteractsWithActions` and `InteractsWithSchemas` traits, and implement the `HasActions` and `HasSchemas` interfaces on your Livewire component class:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Concerns\InteractsWithActions;
use Filament\Actions\Contracts\HasActions;
use Filament\Schemas\Concerns\InteractsWithSchemas;
use Filament\Schemas\Contracts\HasSchemas;
use Livewire\Component;

class ManagePost extends Component implements HasActions, HasSchemas
{
    use InteractsWithActions;
    use InteractsWithSchemas;

    // ...
}
```

## Adding the action

Add a method that returns your action. The method must share the exact same name as the action, or the name followed by `Action`:

```php
use App\Models\Post;
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Actions\Concerns\InteractsWithActions;
use Filament\Actions\Contracts\HasActions;
use Filament\Schemas\Concerns\InteractsWithSchemas;
use Filament\Schemas\Contracts\HasSchemas;
use Livewire\Component;

class ManagePost extends Component implements HasActions, HasSchemas
{
    use InteractsWithActions;
    use InteractsWithSchemas;

    public Post $post;

    public function deleteAction(): Action
    {
        return Action::make('delete')
            ->color('danger')
            ->requiresConfirmation()
            ->action(fn () => $this->post->delete());
    }
    
    // This method name also works, since the action name is `delete`:
    // public function delete(): Action
    
    // This method name does not work, since the action name is `delete`, not `deletePost`:
    // public function deletePost(): Action

    // ...
}
```

Finally, you need to render the action in your view. To do this, you can use `{{ $this->deleteAction }}`, where you replace `deleteAction` with the name of your action method:

```blade
<div>
    {{ $this->deleteAction }}

    <x-filament-actions::modals />
</div>
```

You also need `<x-filament-actions::modals />` which injects the HTML required to render action modals. This only needs to be included within the Livewire component once, regardless of how many actions you have for that component.

<Aside variant="info">
    `filament/actions` also includes the following packages:
    
    - `filament/forms`
    - `filament/infolists`
    - `filament/notifications`
    - `filament/support`
    
    These packages allow you to use their components within Livewire components.
    For example, if your action uses [Notifications](notifications), remember to include `@livewire('notifications')` in your layout and add `@import '../../vendor/filament/notifications/resources/css/index.css'` to your CSS file.
    
    If you are using any other [Filament components](overview#package-components) in your action, make sure to install and integrate the corresponding package as well.
</Aside>

## Passing action arguments

Sometimes, you may wish to pass arguments to your action. For example, if you're rendering the same action multiple times in the same view, but each time for a different model, you could pass the model ID as an argument, and then retrieve it later. To do this, you can invoke the action in your view and pass in the arguments as an array:

```php
<div>
    @foreach ($posts as $post)
        <h2>{{ $post->title }}</h2>

        {{ ($this->deleteAction)(['post' => $post->id]) }}
    @endforeach

    <x-filament-actions::modals />
</div>
```

Now, you can access the post ID in your action method:

```php
use App\Models\Post;
use Filament\Actions\Action;

public function deleteAction(): Action
{
    return Action::make('delete')
        ->color('danger')
        ->requiresConfirmation()
        ->action(function (array $arguments) {
            $post = Post::find($arguments['post']);

            $post?->delete();
        });
}
```

## Hiding actions in a Livewire view

If you use `hidden()` or `visible()` to control if an action is rendered, you should wrap the action in an `@if` check for `isVisible()`:

```blade
<div>
    @if ($this->deleteAction->isVisible())
        {{ $this->deleteAction }}
    @endif
    
    {{-- Or --}}
    
    @if (($this->deleteAction)(['post' => $post->id])->isVisible())
        {{ ($this->deleteAction)(['post' => $post->id]) }}
    @endif
</div>
```

The `hidden()` and `visible()` methods also control if the action is `disabled()`, so they are still useful to protect the action from being run if the user does not have permission. Encapsulating this logic in the `hidden()` or `visible()` of the action itself is good practice otherwise you need to define the condition in the view and in `disabled()`.

You can also take advantage of this to hide any wrapping elements that may not need to be rendered if the action is hidden:

```blade
<div>
    @if ($this->deleteAction->isVisible())
        <div>
            {{ $this->deleteAction }}
        </div>
    @endif
</div>
```

## Grouping actions in a Livewire view

You may [group actions together into a dropdown menu](../actions/grouping-actions) by using the `<x-filament-actions::group>` Blade component, passing in the `actions` array as an attribute:

```blade
<div>
    <x-filament-actions::group :actions="[
        $this->editAction,
        $this->viewAction,
        $this->deleteAction,
    ]" />

    <x-filament-actions::modals />
</div>
```

You can also pass in any attributes to customize the appearance of the trigger button and dropdown:

```blade
<div>
    <x-filament-actions::group
        :actions="[
            $this->editAction,
            $this->viewAction,
            $this->deleteAction,
        ]"
        label="Actions"
        icon="heroicon-m-ellipsis-vertical"
        color="primary"
        size="md"
        tooltip="More actions"
        dropdown-placement="bottom-start"
    />

    <x-filament-actions::modals />
</div>
```

## Chaining actions

You can chain multiple actions together, by calling the `replaceMountedAction()` method to replace the current action with another when it has finished:

```php
use App\Models\Post;
use Filament\Actions\Action;

public function editAction(): Action
{
    return Action::make('edit')
        ->schema([
            // ...
        ])
        // ...
        ->action(function (array $arguments) {
            $post = Post::find($arguments['post']);

            // ...

            $this->replaceMountedAction('publish', $arguments);
        });
}

public function publishAction(): Action
{
    return Action::make('publish')
        ->requiresConfirmation()
        // ...
        ->action(function (array $arguments) {
            $post = Post::find($arguments['post']);

            $post->publish();
        });
}
```

Now, when the first action is submitted, the second action will open in its place. The [arguments](#passing-action-arguments) that were originally passed to the first action get passed to the second action, so you can use them to persist data between requests.

If the first action is canceled, the second one is not opened. If the second action is canceled, the first one has already run and cannot be cancelled.

## Programmatically triggering actions

Sometimes you may need to trigger an action without the user clicking on the built-in trigger button, especially from JavaScript. Here is an example action which could be registered on a Livewire component:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;

public function testAction(): Action
{
    return Action::make('test')
        ->requiresConfirmation()
        ->action(function (array $arguments) {
            dd('Test action called', $arguments);
        });
}
```

You can trigger that action from a click in your HTML using the `wire:click` attribute, calling the `mountAction()` method and optionally passing in any arguments that you want to be available:

```blade
<button wire:click="mountAction('test', { id: 12345 })">
    Button
</button>
```

To trigger that action from JavaScript, you can use the [`$wire` utility](https://livewire.laravel.com/docs/alpine#controlling-livewire-from-alpine-using-wire), passing in the same arguments:

```js
$wire.mountAction('test', { id: 12345 })
```


=== .ai/03-checkbox rules ===

---
title: Checkbox Blade component
---

## Introduction

You can use the checkbox component to render a checkbox input that can be used to toggle a boolean value:

```blade
<label>
    <x-filament::input.checkbox wire:model="isAdmin" />

    <span>
        Is Admin
    </span>
</label>
```

## Triggering the error state of the checkbox

The checkbox has special styling that you can use if it is invalid. To trigger this styling, you can use either Blade or Alpine.js.

To trigger the error state using Blade, you can pass the `valid` attribute to the component, which contains either true or false based on if the checkbox is valid or not:

```blade
<x-filament::input.checkbox
    wire:model="isAdmin"
    :valid="! $errors->has('isAdmin')"
/>
```

Alternatively, you can use an Alpine.js expression to trigger the error state, based on if it evaluates to `true` or `false`:

```blade
<div x-data="{ errors: ['isAdmin'] }">
    <x-filament::input.checkbox
        x-model="isAdmin"
        alpine-valid="! errors.includes('isAdmin')"
    />
</div>
```


=== .ai/03-link rules ===

---
title: Link Blade component
---

## Introduction

The link component is used to render a clickable link that can perform an action:

```blade
<x-filament::link :href="route('users.create')">
    New user
</x-filament::link>
```

## Using a link as a button

By default, a link's underlying HTML tag is `<a>`. You can change it to be a `<button>` tag by using the `tag` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::link
    wire:click="openNewUserModal"
    tag="button"
>
    New user
</x-filament::link>
```

## Setting the size of a link

By default, the size of a link is "medium". You can make it "small", "large", "extra large" or "extra extra large" by using the `size` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::link size="sm">
    New user
</x-filament::link>

<x-filament::link size="lg">
    New user
</x-filament::link>

<x-filament::link size="xl">
    New user
</x-filament::link>

<x-filament::link size="2xl">
    New user
</x-filament::link>
```

## Setting the font weight of a link

By default, the font weight of links is `semibold`. You can make it `thin`, `extralight`, `light`, `normal`, `medium`, `bold`, `extrabold` or `black` by using the `weight` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::link weight="thin">
    New user
</x-filament::link>

<x-filament::link weight="extralight">
    New user
</x-filament::link>

<x-filament::link weight="light">
    New user
</x-filament::link>

<x-filament::link weight="normal">
    New user
</x-filament::link>

<x-filament::link weight="medium">
    New user
</x-filament::link>

<x-filament::link weight="semibold">
    New user
</x-filament::link>
   
<x-filament::link weight="bold">
    New user
</x-filament::link>

<x-filament::link weight="black">
    New user
</x-filament::link> 
```

Alternatively, you can pass in a custom CSS class to define the weight:

```blade
<x-filament::link weight="md:font-[650]">
    New user
</x-filament::link>
```

## Changing the color of a link

By default, the color of a link is "primary". You can change it to be `danger`, `gray`, `info`, `success` or `warning` by using the `color` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::link color="danger">
    New user
</x-filament::link>

<x-filament::link color="gray">
    New user
</x-filament::link>

<x-filament::link color="info">
    New user
</x-filament::link>

<x-filament::link color="success">
    New user
</x-filament::link>

<x-filament::link color="warning">
    New user
</x-filament::link>
```

## Adding an icon to a link

You can add an [icon](../styling/icons) to a link by using the `icon` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::link icon="heroicon-m-sparkles">
    New user
</x-filament::link>
```

You can also change the icon's position to be after the text instead of before it, using the `icon-position` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::link
    icon="heroicon-m-sparkles"
    icon-position="after"
>
    New user
</x-filament::link>
```

## Adding a tooltip to a link

You can add a tooltip to a link by using the `tooltip` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::link tooltip="Register a user">
    New user
</x-filament::link>
```

## Adding a badge to a link

You can render a [badge](badge) on top of a link by using the `badge` slot:

```blade
<x-filament::link>
    Mark notifications as read

    <x-slot name="badge">
        3
    </x-slot>
</x-filament::link>
```

You can [change the color](badge#changing-the-color-of-the-badge) of the badge using the `badge-color` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::link badge-color="danger">
    Mark notifications as read

    <x-slot name="badge">
        3
    </x-slot>
</x-filament::link>
```


=== .ai/02-schema rules ===

---
title: Rendering a schema in a Blade view
---
import Aside from "@components/Aside.astro"

<Aside variant="warning">
    Before proceeding, make sure `filament/schemas` is installed in your project. You can check by running:

    ```bash
    composer show filament/schemas
    ```
    If it's not installed, consult the [installation guide](../introduction/installation#installing-the-individual-components) and configure the **individual components** according to the instructions.
</Aside>

## Setting up the Livewire component

First, generate a new Livewire component:

```bash
php artisan make:livewire ViewProduct
```

Then, render your Livewire component on the page:

```blade
@livewire('view-product')
```

Alternatively, you can use a full-page Livewire component:

```php
use App\Livewire\ViewProduct;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;

Route::get('products/{product}', ViewProduct::class);
```

You must use the `InteractsWithSchemas` trait, and implement the `HasSchemas` interface on your Livewire component class:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Concerns\InteractsWithSchemas;
use Filament\Schemas\Contracts\HasSchemas;
use Livewire\Component;

class ViewProduct extends Component implements HasSchemas
{
    use InteractsWithSchemas;

    // ...
}
```

## Adding the schema

Next, add a method to the Livewire component which accepts a `$schema` object, modifies it, and returns it:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Schema;

public function productSchema(Schema $schema): Schema
{
    return $schema
        ->components([
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

Finally, render the schema in the Livewire component's view:

```blade
{{ $this->productSchema }}
```

<Aside variant="info">
    `filament/schemas` also includes the following packages:

    - `filament/actions`
    - `filament/support`
    
    These packages allow you to use their components within Livewire components.
    For example, if your schema uses [Actions](../actions), remember to implement the `HasActions` interface and use the `InteractsWithActions` trait on your Livewire component class.
    
    If you are using any other [Filament components](overview#package-components) in your schema, make sure to install and integrate the corresponding package as well.
</Aside>


=== foundation rules ===

# Laravel Boost Guidelines

The Laravel Boost guidelines are specifically curated by Laravel maintainers for this application. These guidelines should be followed closely to enhance the user's satisfaction building Laravel applications.

## Foundational Context
This application is a Laravel application and its main Laravel ecosystems package & versions are below. You are an expert with them all. Ensure you abide by these specific packages & versions.

- php - 8.4.16
- filament/filament (FILAMENT) - v4
- laravel/fortify (FORTIFY) - v1
- laravel/framework (LARAVEL) - v12
- laravel/prompts (PROMPTS) - v0
- livewire/flux (FLUXUI_FREE) - v2
- livewire/livewire (LIVEWIRE) - v3
- livewire/volt (VOLT) - v1
- laravel/mcp (MCP) - v0
- laravel/pint (PINT) - v1
- laravel/sail (SAIL) - v1
- pestphp/pest (PEST) - v4
- phpunit/phpunit (PHPUNIT) - v12
- tailwindcss (TAILWINDCSS) - v4

## Conventions
- You must follow all existing code conventions used in this application. When creating or editing a file, check sibling files for the correct structure, approach, naming.
- Use descriptive names for variables and methods. For example, `isRegisteredForDiscounts`, not `discount()`.
- Check for existing components to reuse before writing a new one.

## Verification Scripts
- Do not create verification scripts or tinker when tests cover that functionality and prove it works. Unit and feature tests are more important.

## Application Structure & Architecture
- Stick to existing directory structure - don't create new base folders without approval.
- Do not change the application's dependencies without approval.

## Frontend Bundling
- If the user doesn't see a frontend change reflected in the UI, it could mean they need to run `npm run build`, `npm run dev`, or `composer run dev`. Ask them.

## Replies
- Be concise in your explanations - focus on what's important rather than explaining obvious details.

## Documentation Files
- You must only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the user.


=== boost rules ===

## Laravel Boost
- Laravel Boost is an MCP server that comes with powerful tools designed specifically for this application. Use them.

## Artisan
- Use the `list-artisan-commands` tool when you need to call an Artisan command to double check the available parameters.

## URLs
- Whenever you share a project URL with the user you should use the `get-absolute-url` tool to ensure you're using the correct scheme, domain / IP, and port.

## Tinker / Debugging
- You should use the `tinker` tool when you need to execute PHP to debug code or query Eloquent models directly.
- Use the `database-query` tool when you only need to read from the database.

## Reading Browser Logs With the `browser-logs` Tool
- You can read browser logs, errors, and exceptions using the `browser-logs` tool from Boost.
- Only recent browser logs will be useful - ignore old logs.

## Searching Documentation (Critically Important)
- Boost comes with a powerful `search-docs` tool you should use before any other approaches. This tool automatically passes a list of installed packages and their versions to the remote Boost API, so it returns only version-specific documentation specific for the user's circumstance. You should pass an array of packages to filter on if you know you need docs for particular packages.
- The 'search-docs' tool is perfect for all Laravel related packages, including Laravel, Inertia, Livewire, Filament, Tailwind, Pest, Nova, Nightwatch, etc.
- You must use this tool to search for Laravel-ecosystem documentation before falling back to other approaches.
- Search the documentation before making code changes to ensure we are taking the correct approach.
- Use multiple, broad, simple, topic based queries to start. For example: `['rate limiting', 'routing rate limiting', 'routing']`.
- Do not add package names to queries - package information is already shared. For example, use `test resource table`, not `filament 4 test resource table`.

### Available Search Syntax
- You can and should pass multiple queries at once. The most relevant results will be returned first.

1. Simple Word Searches with auto-stemming - query=authentication - finds 'authenticate' and 'auth'
2. Multiple Words (AND Logic) - query=rate limit - finds knowledge containing both "rate" AND "limit"
3. Quoted Phrases (Exact Position) - query="infinite scroll" - Words must be adjacent and in that order
4. Mixed Queries - query=middleware "rate limit" - "middleware" AND exact phrase "rate limit"
5. Multiple Queries - queries=["authentication", "middleware"] - ANY of these terms


=== php rules ===

## PHP

- Always use curly braces for control structures, even if it has one line.

### Constructors
- Use PHP 8 constructor property promotion in `__construct()`.
    - <code-snippet>public function __construct(public GitHub $github) { }</code-snippet>
- Do not allow empty `__construct()` methods with zero parameters.

### Type Declarations
- Always use explicit return type declarations for methods and functions.
- Use appropriate PHP type hints for method parameters.

<code-snippet name="Explicit Return Types and Method Params" lang="php">
protected function isAccessible(User $user, ?string $path = null): bool
{
    ...
}
</code-snippet>

## Comments
- Prefer PHPDoc blocks over comments. Never use comments within the code itself unless there is something _very_ complex going on.

## PHPDoc Blocks
- Add useful array shape type definitions for arrays when appropriate.

## Enums
- Typically, keys in an Enum should be TitleCase. For example: `FavoritePerson`, `BestLake`, `Monthly`.


=== tests rules ===

## Test Enforcement

- Every change must be programmatically tested. Write a new test or update an existing test, then run the affected tests to make sure they pass.
- Run the minimum number of tests needed to ensure code quality and speed. Use `php artisan test` with a specific filename or filter.


=== laravel/core rules ===

## Do Things the Laravel Way

- Use `php artisan make:` commands to create new files (i.e. migrations, controllers, models, etc.). You can list available Artisan commands using the `list-artisan-commands` tool.
- If you're creating a generic PHP class, use `php artisan make:class`.
- Pass `--no-interaction` to all Artisan commands to ensure they work without user input. You should also pass the correct `--options` to ensure correct behavior.

### Database
- Always use proper Eloquent relationship methods with return type hints. Prefer relationship methods over raw queries or manual joins.
- Use Eloquent models and relationships before suggesting raw database queries
- Avoid `DB::`; prefer `Model::query()`. Generate code that leverages Laravel's ORM capabilities rather than bypassing them.
- Generate code that prevents N+1 query problems by using eager loading.
- Use Laravel's query builder for very complex database operations.

### Model Creation
- When creating new models, create useful factories and seeders for them too. Ask the user if they need any other things, using `list-artisan-commands` to check the available options to `php artisan make:model`.

### APIs & Eloquent Resources
- For APIs, default to using Eloquent API Resources and API versioning unless existing API routes do not, then you should follow existing application convention.

### Controllers & Validation
- Always create Form Request classes for validation rather than inline validation in controllers. Include both validation rules and custom error messages.
- Check sibling Form Requests to see if the application uses array or string based validation rules.

### Queues
- Use queued jobs for time-consuming operations with the `ShouldQueue` interface.

### Authentication & Authorization
- Use Laravel's built-in authentication and authorization features (gates, policies, Sanctum, etc.).

### URL Generation
- When generating links to other pages, prefer named routes and the `route()` function.

### Configuration
- Use environment variables only in configuration files - never use the `env()` function directly outside of config files. Always use `config('app.name')`, not `env('APP_NAME')`.

### Testing
- When creating models for tests, use the factories for the models. Check if the factory has custom states that can be used before manually setting up the model.
- Faker: Use methods such as `$this->faker->word()` or `fake()->randomDigit()`. Follow existing conventions whether to use `$this->faker` or `fake()`.
- When creating tests, make use of `php artisan make:test [options] {name}` to create a feature test, and pass `--unit` to create a unit test. Most tests should be feature tests.

### Vite Error
- If you receive an "Illuminate\Foundation\ViteException: Unable to locate file in Vite manifest" error, you can run `npm run build` or ask the user to run `npm run dev` or `composer run dev`.


=== laravel/v12 rules ===

## Laravel 12

- Use the `search-docs` tool to get version specific documentation.
- Since Laravel 11, Laravel has a new streamlined file structure which this project uses.

### Laravel 12 Structure
- No middleware files in `app/Http/Middleware/`.
- `bootstrap/app.php` is the file to register middleware, exceptions, and routing files.
- `bootstrap/providers.php` contains application specific service providers.
- **No app\Console\Kernel.php** - use `bootstrap/app.php` or `routes/console.php` for console configuration.
- **Commands auto-register** - files in `app/Console/Commands/` are automatically available and do not require manual registration.

### Database
- When modifying a column, the migration must include all of the attributes that were previously defined on the column. Otherwise, they will be dropped and lost.
- Laravel 11 allows limiting eagerly loaded records natively, without external packages: `$query->latest()->limit(10);`.

### Models
- Casts can and likely should be set in a `casts()` method on a model rather than the `$casts` property. Follow existing conventions from other models.


=== fluxui-free/core rules ===

## Flux UI Free

- This project is using the free edition of Flux UI. It has full access to the free components and variants, but does not have access to the Pro components.
- Flux UI is a component library for Livewire. Flux is a robust, hand-crafted, UI component library for your Livewire applications. It's built using Tailwind CSS and provides a set of components that are easy to use and customize.
- You should use Flux UI components when available.
- Fallback to standard Blade components if Flux is unavailable.
- If available, use Laravel Boost's `search-docs` tool to get the exact documentation and code snippets available for this project.
- Flux UI components look like this:

<code-snippet name="Flux UI Component Usage Example" lang="blade">
    <flux:button variant="primary"/>
</code-snippet>


### Available Components
This is correct as of Boost installation, but there may be additional components within the codebase.

<available-flux-components>
avatar, badge, brand, breadcrumbs, button, callout, checkbox, dropdown, field, heading, icon, input, modal, navbar, otp-input, profile, radio, select, separator, skeleton, switch, text, textarea, tooltip
</available-flux-components>


=== livewire/core rules ===

## Livewire Core
- Use the `search-docs` tool to find exact version specific documentation for how to write Livewire & Livewire tests.
- Use the `php artisan make:livewire [Posts\CreatePost]` artisan command to create new components
- State should live on the server, with the UI reflecting it.
- All Livewire requests hit the Laravel backend, they're like regular HTTP requests. Always validate form data, and run authorization checks in Livewire actions.

## Livewire Best Practices
- Livewire components require a single root element.
- Use `wire:loading` and `wire:dirty` for delightful loading states.
- Add `wire:key` in loops:

    ```blade
    @foreach ($items as $item)
        <div wire:key="item-{{ $item->id }}">
            {{ $item->name }}
        </div>
    @endforeach
    ```

- Prefer lifecycle hooks like `mount()`, `updatedFoo()` for initialization and reactive side effects:

<code-snippet name="Lifecycle hook examples" lang="php">
    public function mount(User $user) { $this->user = $user; }
    public function updatedSearch() { $this->resetPage(); }
</code-snippet>


## Testing Livewire

<code-snippet name="Example Livewire component test" lang="php">
    Livewire::test(Counter::class)
        ->assertSet('count', 0)
        ->call('increment')
        ->assertSet('count', 1)
        ->assertSee(1)
        ->assertStatus(200);
</code-snippet>


    <code-snippet name="Testing a Livewire component exists within a page" lang="php">
        $this->get('/posts/create')
        ->assertSeeLivewire(CreatePost::class);
    </code-snippet>


=== livewire/v3 rules ===

## Livewire 3

### Key Changes From Livewire 2
- These things changed in Livewire 2, but may not have been updated in this application. Verify this application's setup to ensure you conform with application conventions.
    - Use `wire:model.live` for real-time updates, `wire:model` is now deferred by default.
    - Components now use the `App\Livewire` namespace (not `App\Http\Livewire`).
    - Use `$this->dispatch()` to dispatch events (not `emit` or `dispatchBrowserEvent`).
    - Use the `components.layouts.app` view as the typical layout path (not `layouts.app`).

### New Directives
- `wire:show`, `wire:transition`, `wire:cloak`, `wire:offline`, `wire:target` are available for use. Use the documentation to find usage examples.

### Alpine
- Alpine is now included with Livewire, don't manually include Alpine.js.
- Plugins included with Alpine: persist, intersect, collapse, and focus.

### Lifecycle Hooks
- You can listen for `livewire:init` to hook into Livewire initialization, and `fail.status === 419` for the page expiring:

<code-snippet name="livewire:load example" lang="js">
document.addEventListener('livewire:init', function () {
    Livewire.hook('request', ({ fail }) => {
        if (fail && fail.status === 419) {
            alert('Your session expired');
        }
    });

    Livewire.hook('message.failed', (message, component) => {
        console.error(message);
    });
});
</code-snippet>


=== volt/core rules ===

## Livewire Volt

- This project uses Livewire Volt for interactivity within its pages. New pages requiring interactivity must also use Livewire Volt. There is documentation available for it.
- Make new Volt components using `php artisan make:volt [name] [--test] [--pest]`
- Volt is a **class-based** and **functional** API for Livewire that supports single-file components, allowing a component's PHP logic and Blade templates to co-exist in the same file
- Livewire Volt allows PHP logic and Blade templates in one file. Components use the `@volt` directive.
- You must check existing Volt components to determine if they're functional or class based. If you can't detect that, ask the user which they prefer before writing a Volt component.

### Volt Functional Component Example

<code-snippet name="Volt Functional Component Example" lang="php">
@volt
<?php
use function Livewire\Volt\{state, computed};

state(['count' => 0]);

$increment = fn () => $this->count++;
$decrement = fn () => $this->count--;

$double = computed(fn () => $this->count * 2);
?>

<div>
    <h1>Count: {{ $count }}</h1>
    <h2>Double: {{ $this->double }}</h2>
    <button wire:click="increment">+</button>
    <button wire:click="decrement">-</button>
</div>
@endvolt
</code-snippet>


### Volt Class Based Component Example
To get started, define an anonymous class that extends Livewire\Volt\Component. Within the class, you may utilize all of the features of Livewire using traditional Livewire syntax:


<code-snippet name="Volt Class-based Volt Component Example" lang="php">
use Livewire\Volt\Component;

new class extends Component {
    public $count = 0;

    public function increment()
    {
        $this->count++;
    }
} ?>

<div>
    <h1>{{ $count }}</h1>
    <button wire:click="increment">+</button>
</div>
</code-snippet>


### Testing Volt & Volt Components
- Use the existing directory for tests if it already exists. Otherwise, fallback to `tests/Feature/Volt`.

<?php

use App\Models\Product;
use function Livewire\Volt\{state, computed};

state(['editing' => null, 'search' => '']);

$products = computed(fn() => Product::when($this->search,
    fn($q) => $q->where('name', 'like', "%{$this->search}%")
)->get());

$edit = fn(Product $product) => $this->editing = $product->id;
$delete = fn(Product $product) => $product->delete();

?>

    />
</code-snippet>

<code-snippet name="Loading States With Volt" lang="php">

=== pint/core rules ===

## Laravel Pint Code Formatter

- You must run `vendor/bin/pint --dirty` before finalizing changes to ensure your code matches the project's expected style.
- Do not run `vendor/bin/pint --test`, simply run `vendor/bin/pint` to fix any formatting issues.


=== pest/core rules ===

## Pest
### Testing
- If you need to verify a feature is working, write or update a Unit / Feature test.

### Pest Tests
- All tests must be written using Pest. Use `php artisan make:test --pest {name}`.
- You must not remove any tests or test files from the tests directory without approval. These are not temporary or helper files - these are core to the application.
- Tests should test all of the happy paths, failure paths, and weird paths.
- Tests live in the `tests/Feature` and `tests/Unit` directories.
- Pest tests look and behave like this:
<code-snippet name="Basic Pest Test Example" lang="php">
it('is true', function () {
    expect(true)->toBeTrue();
});
</code-snippet>

### Running Tests
- Run the minimal number of tests using an appropriate filter before finalizing code edits.
- To run all tests: `php artisan test`.
- To run all tests in a file: `php artisan test tests/Feature/ExampleTest.php`.
- To filter on a particular test name: `php artisan test --filter=testName` (recommended after making a change to a related file).
- When the tests relating to your changes are passing, ask the user if they would like to run the entire test suite to ensure everything is still passing.

### Pest Assertions
- When asserting status codes on a response, use the specific method like `assertForbidden` and `assertNotFound` instead of using `assertStatus(403)` or similar, e.g.:
<code-snippet name="Pest Example Asserting postJson Response" lang="php">
it('returns all', function () {
    $response = $this->postJson('/api/docs', []);

    $response->assertSuccessful();
});
</code-snippet>

### Mocking
- Mocking can be very helpful when appropriate.
- When mocking, you can use the `Pest\Laravel\mock` Pest function, but always import it via `use function Pest\Laravel\mock;` before using it. Alternatively, you can use `$this->mock()` if existing tests do.
- You can also create partial mocks using the same import or self method.

### Datasets
- Use datasets in Pest to simplify tests which have a lot of duplicated data. This is often the case when testing validation rules, so consider going with this solution when writing tests for validation rules.

<code-snippet name="Pest Dataset Example" lang="php">
it('has emails', function (string $email) {
    expect($email)->not->toBeEmpty();
})->with([
    'james' => 'james@laravel.com',
    'taylor' => 'taylor@laravel.com',
]);
</code-snippet>


=== pest/v4 rules ===

## Pest 4

- Pest v4 is a huge upgrade to Pest and offers: browser testing, smoke testing, visual regression testing, test sharding, and faster type coverage.
- Browser testing is incredibly powerful and useful for this project.
- Browser tests should live in `tests/Browser/`.
- Use the `search-docs` tool for detailed guidance on utilizing these features.

### Browser Testing
- You can use Laravel features like `Event::fake()`, `assertAuthenticated()`, and model factories within Pest v4 browser tests, as well as `RefreshDatabase` (when needed) to ensure a clean state for each test.
- Interact with the page (click, type, scroll, select, submit, drag-and-drop, touch gestures, etc.) when appropriate to complete the test.
- If requested, test on multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
- If requested, test on different devices and viewports (like iPhone 14 Pro, tablets, or custom breakpoints).
- Switch color schemes (light/dark mode) when appropriate.
- Take screenshots or pause tests for debugging when appropriate.

### Example Tests

<code-snippet name="Pest Browser Test Example" lang="php">
it('may reset the password', function () {
    Notification::fake();

    $this->actingAs(User::factory()->create());

    $page = visit('/sign-in'); // Visit on a real browser...

    $page->assertSee('Sign In')
        ->assertNoJavascriptErrors() // or ->assertNoConsoleLogs()
        ->click('Forgot Password?')
        ->fill('email', 'nuno@laravel.com')
        ->click('Send Reset Link')
        ->assertSee('We have emailed your password reset link!')

    Notification::assertSent(ResetPassword::class);
});
</code-snippet>

<code-snippet name="Pest Smoke Testing Example" lang="php">
$pages = visit(['/', '/about', '/contact']);

$pages->assertNoJavascriptErrors()->assertNoConsoleLogs();
</code-snippet>


=== tailwindcss/core rules ===

## Tailwind Core

- Use Tailwind CSS classes to style HTML, check and use existing tailwind conventions within the project before writing your own.
- Offer to extract repeated patterns into components that match the project's conventions (i.e. Blade, JSX, Vue, etc..)
- Think through class placement, order, priority, and defaults - remove redundant classes, add classes to parent or child carefully to limit repetition, group elements logically
- You can use the `search-docs` tool to get exact examples from the official documentation when needed.

### Spacing
- When listing items, use gap utilities for spacing, don't use margins.

    <code-snippet name="Valid Flex Gap Spacing Example" lang="html">
        <div class="flex gap-8">
            <div>Superior</div>
            <div>Michigan</div>
            <div>Erie</div>
        </div>
    </code-snippet>


### Dark Mode
- If existing pages and components support dark mode, new pages and components must support dark mode in a similar way, typically using `dark:`.


=== tailwindcss/v4 rules ===

## Tailwind 4

- Always use Tailwind CSS v4 - do not use the deprecated utilities.
- `corePlugins` is not supported in Tailwind v4.
- In Tailwind v4, configuration is CSS-first using the `@theme` directive — no separate `tailwind.config.js` file is needed.
<code-snippet name="Extending Theme in CSS" lang="css">
@theme {
  --color-brand: oklch(0.72 0.11 178);
}
</code-snippet>

- In Tailwind v4, you import Tailwind using a regular CSS `@import` statement, not using the `@tailwind` directives used in v3:

<code-snippet name="Tailwind v4 Import Tailwind Diff" lang="diff">
   - @tailwind base;
   - @tailwind components;
   - @tailwind utilities;
   + @import "tailwindcss";
</code-snippet>


### Replaced Utilities
- Tailwind v4 removed deprecated utilities. Do not use the deprecated option - use the replacement.
- Opacity values are still numeric.

| Deprecated |	Replacement |
|------------+--------------|
| bg-opacity-* | bg-black/* |
| text-opacity-* | text-black/* |
| border-opacity-* | border-black/* |
| divide-opacity-* | divide-black/* |
| ring-opacity-* | ring-black/* |
| placeholder-opacity-* | placeholder-black/* |
| flex-shrink-* | shrink-* |
| flex-grow-* | grow-* |
| overflow-ellipsis | text-ellipsis |
| decoration-slice | box-decoration-slice |
| decoration-clone | box-decoration-clone |


=== filament/filament rules ===

## Filament
- Filament is used by this application, check how and where to follow existing application conventions.
- Filament is a Server-Driven UI (SDUI) framework for Laravel. It allows developers to define user interfaces in PHP using structured configuration objects. It is built on top of Livewire, Alpine.js, and Tailwind CSS.
- You can use the `search-docs` tool to get information from the official Filament documentation when needed. This is very useful for Artisan command arguments, specific code examples, testing functionality, relationship management, and ensuring you're following idiomatic practices.
- Utilize static `make()` methods for consistent component initialization.

### Artisan
- You must use the Filament specific Artisan commands to create new files or components for Filament. You can find these with the `list-artisan-commands` tool, or with `php artisan` and the `--help` option.
- Inspect the required options, always pass `--no-interaction`, and valid arguments for other options when applicable.

### Filament's Core Features
- Actions: Handle doing something within the application, often with a button or link. Actions encapsulate the UI, the interactive modal window, and the logic that should be executed when the modal window is submitted. They can be used anywhere in the UI and are commonly used to perform one-time actions like deleting a record, sending an email, or updating data in the database based on modal form input.
- Forms: Dynamic forms rendered within other features, such as resources, action modals, table filters, and more.
- Infolists: Read-only lists of data.
- Notifications: Flash notifications displayed to users within the application.
- Panels: The top-level container in Filament that can include all other features like pages, resources, forms, tables, notifications, actions, infolists, and widgets.
- Resources: Static classes that are used to build CRUD interfaces for Eloquent models. Typically live in `app/Filament/Resources`.
- Schemas: Represent components that define the structure and behavior of the UI, such as forms, tables, or lists.
- Tables: Interactive tables with filtering, sorting, pagination, and more.
- Widgets: Small component included within dashboards, often used for displaying data in charts, tables, or as a stat.

### Relationships
- Determine if you can use the `relationship()` method on form components when you need `options` for a select, checkbox, repeater, or when building a `Fieldset`:

<code-snippet name="Relationship example for Form Select" lang="php">
Forms\Components\Select::make('user_id')
    ->label('Author')
    ->relationship('author')
    ->required(),
</code-snippet>


## Testing
- It's important to test Filament functionality for user satisfaction.
- Ensure that you are authenticated to access the application within the test.
- Filament uses Livewire, so start assertions with `livewire()` or `Livewire::test()`.

### Example Tests

<code-snippet name="Filament Table Test" lang="php">
    livewire(ListUsers::class)
        ->assertCanSeeTableRecords($users)
        ->searchTable($users->first()->name)
        ->assertCanSeeTableRecords($users->take(1))
        ->assertCanNotSeeTableRecords($users->skip(1))
        ->searchTable($users->last()->email)
        ->assertCanSeeTableRecords($users->take(-1))
        ->assertCanNotSeeTableRecords($users->take($users->count() - 1));
</code-snippet>

<code-snippet name="Filament Create Resource Test" lang="php">
    livewire(CreateUser::class)
        ->fillForm([
            'name' => 'Howdy',
            'email' => 'howdy@example.com',
        ])
        ->call('create')
        ->assertNotified()
        ->assertRedirect();

    assertDatabaseHas(User::class, [
        'name' => 'Howdy',
        'email' => 'howdy@example.com',
    ]);
</code-snippet>

<code-snippet name="Testing Multiple Panels (setup())" lang="php">
    use Filament\Facades\Filament;

    Filament::setCurrentPanel('app');
</code-snippet>

<code-snippet name="Calling an Action in a Test" lang="php">
    livewire(EditInvoice::class, [
        'invoice' => $invoice,
    ])->callAction('send');

    expect($invoice->refresh())->isSent()->toBeTrue();
</code-snippet>


### Important Version 4 Changes
- File visibility is now `private` by default.
- The `deferFilters` method from Filament v3 is now the default behavior in Filament v4, so users must click a button before the filters are applied to the table. To disable this behavior, you can use the `deferFilters(false)` method.
- The `Grid`, `Section`, and `Fieldset` layout components no longer span all columns by default.
- The `all` pagination page method is not available for tables by default.
- All action classes extend `Filament\Actions\Action`. No action classes exist in `Filament\Tables\Actions`.
- The `Form` & `Infolist` layout components have been moved to `Filament\Schemas\Components`, for example `Grid`, `Section`, `Fieldset`, `Tabs`, `Wizard`, etc.
- A new `Repeater` component for Forms has been added.
- Icons now use the `Filament\Support\Icons\Heroicon` Enum by default. Other options are available and documented.

### Organize Component Classes Structure
- Schema components: `Schemas/Components/`
- Table columns: `Tables/Columns/`
- Table filters: `Tables/Filters/`
- Actions: `Actions/`


=== laravel/fortify rules ===

## Laravel Fortify

Fortify is a headless authentication backend that provides authentication routes and controllers for Laravel applications.

**Before implementing any authentication features, use the `search-docs` tool to get the latest docs for that specific feature.**

### Configuration & Setup
- Check `config/fortify.php` to see what's enabled. Use `search-docs` for detailed information on specific features.
- Enable features by adding them to the `'features' => []` array: `Features::registration()`, `Features::resetPasswords()`, etc.
- To see the all Fortify registered routes, use the `list-routes` tool with the `only_vendor: true` and `action: "Fortify"` parameters.
- Fortify includes view routes by default (login, register). Set `'views' => false` in the configuration file to disable them if you're handling views yourself.

### Customization
- Views can be customized in `FortifyServiceProvider`'s `boot()` method using `Fortify::loginView()`, `Fortify::registerView()`, etc.
- Customize authentication logic with `Fortify::authenticateUsing()` for custom user retrieval / validation.
- Actions in `app/Actions/Fortify/` handle business logic (user creation, password reset, etc.). They're fully customizable, so you can modify them to change feature behavior.

## Available Features
- `Features::registration()` for user registration.
- `Features::emailVerification()` to verify new user emails.
- `Features::twoFactorAuthentication()` for 2FA with QR codes and recovery codes.
  - Add options: `['confirmPassword' => true, 'confirm' => true]` to require password confirmation and OTP confirmation before enabling 2FA.
- `Features::updateProfileInformation()` to let users update their profile.
- `Features::updatePasswords()` to let users change their passwords.
- `Features::resetPasswords()` for password reset via email.
