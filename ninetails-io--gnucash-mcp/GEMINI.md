## Project at a glance

An MCP server that exposes a GnuCash SQLite book to AI assistants as a
set of typed tools. Read and write transactions, run reports, manage
scheduled transactions, budgets, investment lots, and a full business
module (customers, vendors, employees, invoices, bills).

**Tech stack:**
- Python 3.10+
- [piecash](https://github.com/sdementen/piecash) — GnuCash SQLite ORM
- [MCP Python SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk) (`mcp[cli]`)
- SQLAlchemy under piecash; direct Core access where the ORM blocks us
- pytest for unit + integration coverage

---

## How the codebase reached its current shape

A few architectural moves shaped the present structure. The full
release-by-release history is in `CHANGELOG.md`; what follows is the
arc, not the chronicle.

- **Single-file → modular mixins.** Early versions kept everything in
  one `book.py`. As the surface grew (reconciliation, reporting,
  budgets, scheduling, investments, business), the monolith was split
  into per-area mixins composed via `build_book_class`. Tools moved
  alongside under `tools/<area>.py`. Disabling a module via
  `--modules` skips both the mixin and the tool registration cleanly.
- **Lazy load with a registry.** `TOOL_MODULES` in `server.py` is the
  single source of truth for which tools belong to which module.
  `_lazy_load_tool_module(name)` imports `tools/<name>.py` only when
  the module is enabled, then `_apply_module_filter` removes anything
  registered that isn't in `TOOL_MODULES[<name>]`. A test in
  `tests/test_modules.py::TestToolFileVsModulesMapping` locks the
  contract — it catches the bug class where a new tool gets the
  `@mcp.tool()` decoration but is forgotten in `TOOL_MODULES`.
- **Multi-currency rebuild.** Originally USD-was-everywhere assumed.
  When the first non-USD-default book showed up, a class of bugs
  surfaced where reports summed raw `split.quantity` across
  commodities, prices defaulted to USD even for currency arguments,
  and FX gain/loss from rate drift wasn't recognized. The fix
  threaded `_split_in_default_currency` (or equivalent factor map)
  through every aggregation path, made `create_price` default to the
  book's default currency, and added realized FX recognition on
  cross-currency invoice payment.
- **Dashboard as a work queue.** `get_book_summary` started as a
  status snapshot and evolved into the LLM's first-call orientation
  surface. It now surfaces net-worth trajectory, runway, monthly net
  income, budget pacing, reconciliation backlog with split counts,
  warnings, and upcoming scheduled transactions — answering "what do
  I need to do next" in one call.
- **Audit log dispatcher.** Originally a 380-line if/elif chain;
  flattened into a `(entity_type, operation) → formatter` dispatch
  table. Adding a new entity-operation pair is one row in the table
  plus a small formatter function.

## Architecture

### Layered design

```
server.py              FastMCP bootstrap. TOOL_MODULES registry.
                       Lazy-loads tool modules from an enabled set;
                       disabled modules never build their Pydantic
                       schemas. Multi-book: GNUCASH_BOOK_PATH takes
                       an os.pathsep-separated list; a module-level
                       singleton holds the CURRENT book and the
                       inline switch_book tool repoints it (visible
                       only when 2+ books are configured).

tools/<area>.py        MCP tool registration. Thin wrappers that
                       validate schemas, unpack arguments (date
                       strings → date objects, etc.), call book
                       methods, format results.

book/<area>.py         Business-logic mixins composed into
                       GnuCashBook via build_book_class. One mixin
                       per subject area (core, business, budgets,
                       investments, reconciliation, reporting,
                       scheduling, admin, backup).

book/_base.py          BaseGnuCashBook. Shared helpers: open(),
                       _find_account, _resolve_account, _resolve_guid,
                       _unique_prefix, audit staging, write
                       verification, template-account filtering.

logging_config.py      Audit log + debug log. @audit_log decorator
                       wraps tool registrations; a dispatch table
                       keyed on (entity_type, operation) handles
                       formatting.

_format.py             Layer-neutral helpers (_format_number,
                       _apply_limit) used by both book and tools.
```

The mixin composition is deliberate. Each mixin owns its subject area
and can be enabled or disabled at server start via `--modules`.
`build_book_class` composes only the enabled mixins into a concrete
`GnuCashBook`, and `tools/` registration mirrors that — a disabled
module contributes zero tools to the MCP surface.

### Invariants worth preserving

- **piecash objects never cross the MCP boundary.** Book methods
  return dicts or primitives. Tool wrappers stringify for transport.
- **One book open per write.** `@audit_log` stages before-state on
  the already-open session via `threading.local`, then reads it back
  at write time. Don't add a second open for audit capture.
- **`split.value` is in transaction currency; `split.quantity` is in
  account commodity.** Reports that aggregate across commodities
  convert `quantity × latest_price` to the book's default currency.
  Both single-currency and multi-currency books work correctly.
- **GUIDs returned to MCP callers are short prefixes** (8 chars,
  extended per birthday-problem collision needs). Tools that accept
  GUIDs accept 8+ char prefixes via `_resolve_guid`. Account refs
  also accept `%xxxxxxx` short-GUID shorthand alongside path and
  full-GUID forms.
- **Cross-currency exchange rates** come from `book.prices`.
  `type='transaction'` auto-defaults created by piecash on
  cross-currency transactions are skipped — they'd shadow user-
  supplied market prices.
- **Every raw-SQL write is verified.** Two-tier contract:
  - **ORM writes** (`book.session.add(obj)`, attribute mutation,
    `book.session.delete(obj)`) rely on SQLAlchemy's commit-side
    verification — constraint violations, missing FKs, and stale-
    object failures raise during `book.save()`. Explicit
    `_verify_*` would be redundant.
  - **Raw-SQL writes** (`book.session.execute(Table.__table__.
    insert/update/delete(...))`) need explicit verification —
    SQLAlchemy executes the SQL but can't tell whether the WHERE
    clause matched any rows or the INSERT actually landed.
    `_verify_write` / `_verify_composite_write` / `_verify_delete`
    read back the affected row and raise if the round-trip doesn't
    match.
  Locked by `tests/test_contract_integrity.py::TestWriteVerificationCoverage`
  — every raw-SQL DML site in `book/*.py` must have a paired
  `_verify_*` call within 40 lines.
- **Template accounts filtered everywhere they shouldn't appear.**
  `book.root_template` and its descendants are real Account rows in
  `book.accounts`. Any iteration that aggregates balances, surfaces
  accounts to the user, or classifies by type must filter them via
  `self._template_account_guids(book)`. `_find_account` and
  `_resolve_account` already do this; raw iterations need the filter
  added explicitly.
- **Flow reports value at monthly closes; stock reports value
  as-of.** `spending_by_category` / `income_by_source` / `cash_flow`
  convert every split at its own MONTH's closing rate in single-
  period and `group_by` modes alike, so grand totals are identical
  at every granularity (locked by `TestModeAgreement`).
  `balance_sheet` / `net_worth` value holdings as of the report
  date — deliberately different semantics. Don't "fix" one to match
  the other.
- **A book switch is transactional and audited.** `switch_book`
  runs everything fallible (book construction, log activation)
  BEFORE the current-book globals move together; a failure leaves
  the server fully on the previous book, and the switch itself is
  written to BOTH books' audit trails. The unlocked current-book
  global is safe only while every tool is sync and the MCP SDK runs
  sync tools inline — `test_all_tools_are_sync` pins that
  assumption; don't add an async tool without redesigning it.
- **Backup/log state is per-book, even under a shared
  `GNUCASH_LOG_DIR`.** The override resolves to a per-book
  subdirectory (`{log_dir}/{book}.mcp`); backup state files and
  retention scoping key on the book's filename stem
  (case-insensitively — stems are validated unique at startup).
  Anything new that persists per-book state under the log dir must
  follow the same scoping or two books will share it.
- **`owner_type` is validated at the entry point**, not pattern-
  matched inline. All six business tools that take it call
  `_parse_owner_type(value)`, which returns the piecash int code or
  raises with a message naming the valid options. A new owner-typed
  tool should follow the same path.
- **Identify accounts by `GNCAccountType`, never by an English name.**
  GnuCash localizes account *names* per locale but never *types*. Code
  that keys off an English literal (`_find_account(book, "Income")`,
  `"mortgage" in fullname`, `name.startswith("Imbalance-")`) is wrong
  the moment the book is `de_DE`/`es_MX`/`zh_CN`/… Resolve top-level
  accounts by type via `_top_level_account_of_type`; where a name
  *must* be used, resolve it from the book's own data, not a hard-coded
  word. Two traps make this stricter than it looks:
  - **Two independent translation sources that disagree.** Wizard chart
    templates (`data/accounts/<locale>/*.gnucash-xea`) and the runtime
    gettext catalog (`po/<lang>.po`) don't always match — a German
    book's top-level income is the template's **"Erträge"** while the
    catalog translation of "Income" is **"Ertrag"**. So a "look up the
    localized word and match it" fix is unsafe for template-created
    accounts. `_infer_book_locale` therefore *votes* across several
    top-level type accounts rather than trusting any one.
  - **Designated accounts self-heal via a KVP slot.** The FX and
    discount resolvers store the resolved account's GUID on the root
    account (`gnc-mcp/fx-gain-loss-acct`, etc.) on first use, then
    resolve by GUID forever after (`_resolve_designated_account`). This
    is locale- AND rename-proof; the leaf name becomes purely cosmetic,
    which is what makes localized created-account names (§6.3) safe. A
    stale slot falls through to the lower layers and is rewritten.

### Data model conventions

- Dates as `datetime.date` internally; ISO strings (`YYYY-MM-DD`) at
  the MCP boundary.
- Amounts as `Decimal` internally; strings at the MCP boundary.
- Account paths colon-delimited, case-sensitive
  (`Expenses:Groceries`).
- GUIDs are 32-char lowercase hex internally; tools emit short
  prefixes and accept any prefix length ≥ 8 via `_resolve_guid`.

---

## piecash gotchas

Hard-won rules. Many were invisible failures before the test coverage
existed.

- **Books must be closed after use.** Use the `open()` context
  manager; it handles the SQLite file lock with retry backoff.
- **`book.flush()` persists pending changes; `book.cancel()` reverts.**
  Don't call `flush()` mid-transaction-build — orphan `Split` objects
  lack `tx_guid` and will raise NOT NULL `IntegrityError`. Let the
  final `book.save()` flush everything together.
- **Account lookup**: use `_find_account(book, fullname)` or
  `_resolve_account(book, ref)` — don't do
  `book.accounts(fullname=name)[0]` (CallableList integer indexing
  raises a slot-assertion error).
- **Newly-created accounts**: `piecash.Account(parent=X, ...)`
  auto-registers via the parent relationship. Don't call
  `book.session.add(acct)` — redundant. And `book.accounts` fullname
  lookups won't find the new account until after flush; in tests,
  keep Python references to the objects you construct.
- **Splits**: `value` is in transaction currency, `quantity` in
  account commodity. Same-currency transactions have
  `value == quantity`. Cross-currency: value on all splits must sum
  to zero (the transaction balances in its own currency); quantities
  don't need to balance across commodities.
- **Cross-currency prices**: piecash auto-creates `type='transaction'`
  price records as effective-rate placeholders on any cross-currency
  transaction. Helpers that walk `book.prices` for market valuation
  must skip these or they'll shadow real user-supplied rates.
- **piecash `Address` is a composite, not a relationship.** It views
  the parent row's `addr_addr1`, `addr_addr2`, etc. columns directly.
  Mutating through the composite (`entity.address.addr1 = "..."`)
  doesn't persist; assigning a fresh `Address(...)` to
  `entity.address` doesn't either. Set the raw columns
  (`entity.addr_addr1 = "..."`) on update.
- **Slot ORM conflicts**: polymorphic relationships on the Slot
  table make direct ORM queries fail. Use raw SQL via
  `sqlalchemy.text()` for slot reads/deletes. For slot **writes
  and per-entity reads**, the `entity[key] = value` /
  `entity[key]` accessors work — piecash handles the polymorphism
  internally. Use `_slot_value_str(...)` from `book/_base.py` to
  extract a stable string from typed slot wrappers
  (`SlotString`, `SlotInt64`, etc.).
- **Slot key naming convention**: bare keys for universal
  financial concepts (`apr`, `credit_limit`,
  `statement_close_day`, `reward_rate`, `is_retirement`); namespaced
  `gnc-mcp/<key>` prefix for tool-specific state where collisions
  with another tool's convention are plausible (e.g.
  `gnc-mcp/applies-to-invoice` for our credit-note linkage).
  Test for which side: *could a reasonable developer arrive at
  this exact key independently?* Yes → bare. No → namespaced.
  Path-style keys (containing `/`) create hierarchical sub-slots
  in GnuCash's KVP store; that's what the namespace prefix
  exploits. The `_SLOT_KEY_RE` validator in `book/admin.py`
  gates USER input to flat keys only — internal slot keys set
  by book methods bypass that gate by design.
- **KVP_Type enum**: `SlotType` TypeDecorator expects `KVP_Type`
  enum values (e.g., `KVP_Type.KVP_TYPE_STRING`), not raw ints.
- **Detached instances**: ORM object attributes are only accessible
  while the session is open. Capture what you need inside the
  `with self.open()` block; accessing after close raises
  `DetachedInstanceError`.
- **`create_transaction()` returns a dict** with `guid` key, not a
  GUID string. `trans_date` expects a `date` object, not a string.
- **Attribute names vs column names**: ORM attributes sometimes
  differ from table columns. `Split.transaction_guid` (column is
  `tx_guid`); `Account.type` (column is `account_type`). `dir(Split)`
  tells you the truth.
- **Indexed queries are ~1000× faster than loops**:
  `book.session.query(X).filter_by(guid=full_guid).first()` over
  `for x in book.x:` for finders. `_find_transaction`, `_find_split`,
  etc. use the indexed form.
- **Never sum num/denom in SQL** — float precision is wrong for
  money. Fetch rows and aggregate in Python with `Decimal`.
- **Voided splits are zombies, not gone.** GnuCash's void operation
  preserves the split with zeroed values and `reconcile_state='v'`
  for audit-trail purposes. Code that asks "does this lot/account
  have any payment activity" must filter on `s.value != 0` or
  `s.reconcile_state != 'v'`, not on split presence alone.
- **GDATE columns are compact `YYYYMMDD` strings — don't feed them to
  `date.fromisoformat` raw.** Date slots/columns stored as GnuCash
  GDATE (e.g. `slots.gdate_val`, an invoice's `trans-date-due`) come
  back as `"20260528"`, no dashes. Python 3.11+ `date.fromisoformat`
  accepts that; **3.10 (a supported target) rejects it and raises.**
  Normalize to digits and build the date explicitly. The bite is
  worse when the caller wraps the parse in a broad `except` — a 3.10
  `ValueError` then silently drops the feature (this is exactly how
  overdue-invoice/bill warnings went dark until found).

---

## Extending the server

### Adding a new tool

The contributor checklist that the test suite enforces:

1. **Method on the mixin.** `book/<area>.py` — add a method to the
   appropriate mixin (`BusinessMixin`, `BudgetsMixin`, etc.). Return
   a dict or primitive; use `Decimal` internally, strings at the
   interface. Dates as `datetime.date` internally.
2. **Tool registration.** `tools/<area>.py` — add a function inside
   `register(mcp, get_book)` decorated with `@mcp.tool`, `@safe_tool`,
   and `@audit_log(classification="read"|"write", operation=..., entity_type=...)`.
   The wrapper unpacks the MCP schema (parses date strings, etc.)
   and calls the book method.
3. **`TOOL_MODULES` entry.** Add the new tool name to
   `TOOL_MODULES[<module>]` in `server.py`. Without this, the tool
   gets registered briefly during lazy-load, then *removed* by
   `_apply_module_filter`'s "drop anything not in keep set" pass —
   silent invisibility at runtime. The contract test
   (`TestToolFileVsModulesMapping` in `tests/test_modules.py`) fails
   loud if you skip this step.
4. **Audit log dispatch entry** (writes only). Add
   `("<entity_type>", "<OPERATION>")` to the dispatch table at the
   bottom of `logging_config.py` plus a small formatter that renders
   the before/after diff.
5. **Tests.** `tests/test_<area>.py` for the book-level method. The
   tool-level integration in `tests/test_tools.py` is mostly there
   for write-shape contracts; add only if the tool has interesting
   schema or wrapper behavior.
6. **Live test.** For write tools, exercise against a test GnuCash
   book before committing. Pause for confirmation if the change
   affects real book data.

### Cross-commodity work

When touching anything that aggregates balances or flows across
accounts of different commodities:

- Use `_split_in_default_currency(split, account, factor)` (or the
  `_market_value` helper) from `book/_currency.py` — the
  CurrencyMixin is composed into every book class unconditionally.
- Flow reports get their factors from `_monthly_conversion_factors`
  (each split at its month's close); as-of valuations use
  `_account_conversion_factors(book, as_of)`. Pick by report kind,
  not convenience — see the flow-vs-stock invariant above.
- Skip `type='transaction'` prices (auto-defaults).
- Fall back to `split.value` when no market rate is on file —
  that's the transaction-currency amount, which equals cost basis
  for default-currency-denominated investment purchases and degrades
  gracefully for foreign-currency holdings without prices.

### Where the business module differs

The business-ledger objects (Customer, Vendor, Employee, Invoice,
Bill, Billterm) have piecash constructors that are blocked — you
can't just `piecash.Invoice(...)`. The create paths in
`book/business.py` use raw SQL inserts paired with `_verify_write`
round-trip checks. When extending the business module, follow that
pattern rather than trying to use the ORM constructors directly.

### Performance considerations

- **Per-write overhead**: one book open, one save. Don't add a second
  open inside `@audit_log` or any decorator — it doubles write
  latency.
- **Reports spanning all transactions**: use `_query_filtered_splits`
  in `book/reporting.py` to push date and account-type filters into
  indexed SQL. Aggregate in Python with `Decimal` (never
  `SUM(num/denom)` in SQL — float precision is wrong for money).
- **Finders**: `book.session.query(X).filter_by(guid=full_guid).first()`
  is indexed. Avoid `for x in book.x:` linear scans for finder
  patterns; the `_find_*` helpers use the indexed form.

---

## Testing

Three layers:

- **Unit tests** under `tests/test_*.py`, one file per mixin area.
  Fast, hermetic, use temporary books per test.
- **Tool-level integration** in `tests/test_tools.py` — exercises the
  MCP registration path (tool → book method → result serialization).
- **Persona-based integration** via `scripts/synthetic_book/*.py`.
  Phase scripts build a realistic multi-year book exercising most
  tool paths. Reporting regressions surface here before unit tests
  catch them. Three synthetic personas ship under `samples/`: Alex
  (USD-default, full feature exercise), Lin Wei (CNY-default,
  zh_CN chart, multi-currency stress), and Sabine Brenner
  (EUR-default, German SKR03 chart — the i18n bug-class oracle).

Run with `uv run pytest`. Per-phase synthetic-book rebuild:
`uv run python scripts/synthetic_book/phase_<N>.py` in order. Each
phase backs up the book before running.

For live verification against a personal GnuCash book, ensure
`GNUCASH_BOOK_PATH` points at a test copy, not production data.

---

## Development conventions

### Commits

- Short summary, then bullets for detail.
- Conventional-commits style prefixes (`feat(budgets):`,
  `fix(core):`).
- No attribution lines.

### Pull requests

- `## Summary` with bullet points, then `## Test plan` with checklist.
- Merge with `--merge --delete-branch` (no squash — preserves feature
  commit history under the merge commit).
- After addressing Copilot review threads (reply + fix), resolve
  them with `uv run python scripts/resolve_pr_threads.py <PR>` —
  bots don't resolve their own threads, so author-resolve keeps
  the PR conversation tab clean. `--dry-run` previews; `--all`
  resolves regardless of author for the rare case a human
  reviewer leaves threads open after agreeing in chat.

### Staging

- Never `git add -A` or `git add .`. Stage specific files by name.

### Committing

- Commits flow freely as work progresses; live validation happens at
  the BRANCH level, not per commit. The bookkeeper loop (live
  testing against a real server on the feature branch, with a
  written test plan and report) runs before the PR opens — the PR
  is the outcome of that loop, not the substrate for it. Changes
  that shift bookkeeper-validated report numbers additionally need
  a capture-rig before/after against the sample oracles.

### Branch workflow (gitflow)

- `main` — release branch. Only receives merges from `develop`.
- `develop` — integration branch. All feature PRs target `develop`.
- Feature branches: `feat/<name>` or `fix/<name>`, branched from
  `develop`.
- Docs-only changes can go directly to `develop`.
- Release: open PR `develop` → `main` only after tester signoff.

---

## When things go wrong

- **Stale SQLite lock** (piecash complains "Lock on the file"):
  check the `gnclock` table. If the holding PID isn't running
  (stale lock from a crashed process), `DELETE FROM gnclock` is
  safe.
- **DetachedInstanceError**: you're accessing an ORM attribute
  after the session closed. Capture the attribute inside the
  `with` block.
- **Balance mismatches** in cross-currency transactions: check
  whether the split `value` (transaction currency) sums to zero.
  Quantities don't need to balance across commodities; values do.
- **Tool defined but not visible to clients**: it's missing from
  `TOOL_MODULES` in `server.py`. The contract test
  (`TestToolFileVsModulesMapping`) catches this.
- **MCP server not seeing code changes**: the server process
  needs a restart for tool-layer changes. Scripts that import
  `gnucash_mcp.book.GnuCashBook` directly bypass the server and
  pick up changes on next invocation.
- **Not sure which book a session was on**: switch_book writes
  `SWITCH BOOK` lines to BOTH books' audit trails (departure on the
  old book, arrival on the new). If those lines are absent, the
  session never switched.
- **Audit log entries missing fields**: the formatter for
  `(entity_type, operation)` may not be in the dispatch table.
  Falls through to a generic renderer that drops detail.
