## read-aware

> - Product: `ReadAware`

## Project Context

- Product: `ReadAware`
- Type: AI-native reading application
- Core capability: context-rich reading and AI-assisted understanding
- Repo: `monorepo` managed by `Turborepo` over `bun` workspaces (`apps/*`, `packages/*`, `plugins/*`)
- Runtime shell: a `Tauri` desktop app **only** (the shipping target) that wraps the React web frontend. The web build is just Tauri's bundled frontend plus local dev / Storybook — not a standalone browser or PWA product
- Frontend: `React 19` as a client-rendered SPA (no SSR)
- Routing: `TanStack Router` (file-based, via the Vite router plugin)
- Styling: `Tailwind CSS v4` (tokens via `@theme` in `apps/web/src/index.css`)
- State management: `Jotai`
- Bundler: `Vite`
- Package manager: `bun`

## AI Architecture Decisions

> **Implementation status** (v0.3.0 — keep this block honest; the sections
> below describe **decided direction**, this one describes what actually runs):
>
> - Frontend-only monorepo (`apps/web` + `apps/desktop`); the Python backend is
>   gone.
> - **Persistence is SQLite**, not the old IndexedDB/localStorage interim layer.
>   IndexedDB survives only in one-time migration code and a font cache.
> - **Event sourcing is live for writes.** Every state change goes through
>   `commit_events`, which appends to `domain_events` and applies it to the
>   projections in ONE transaction (`storage/apply.rs`).
>   `rebuild_projections` replays the log into the tables;
>   `verify_projections` replays into scratch and diffs, so drift is
>   detectable rather than assumed absent.
> - **Known gap:** rows written before that landed still carry mutations the
>   log never recorded (a recolor, a memory reinforcement). `verify_projections`
>   reports them; they cannot be recovered, only outgrown.
> - Not built yet: the sync engine, and the consolidation pipeline behind
>   profile/entity events (they are logged but project to nothing).
> - Target on-device schema: `docs/data-model.md`. Current audit:
>   `docs/review-0.3.0.html`.

- Product architecture: single-agent system (one orchestrator over deterministic pipelines, not one LLM loop doing everything)
- User experience: the in-book chat is one persistent surface per book (prompt assembly is stateless per turn — continuity lives in the memory layer, not the transcript); the global (Context page) chat supports multiple user-created threads. Memory never splits per thread
- System model: memory-first, not transcript-first
- Deployment model: **local-first** — data and retrieval live on-device; the remote backend is a sync/relay layer, not where business logic lives
- Two independent axes — keep them separate:
  - **Data + retrieval: local** (on-device store + SQLite FTS; no vector store — see Storage Responsibilities)
  - **LLM inference: remote** (BYO API key or a thin proxy; no local model required)
- Frontend: a `React + TypeScript` SPA, shipped **only** inside the `Tauri` desktop app (desktop-only)
- On-device storage: `SQLite` only (source of truth + FTS retrieval). **No embeddings / vector store in the default architecture** (decided 2026-07-02, see `docs/agent-architecture.md` §4)
- Remote backend: sync + relay only (see Storage Responsibilities)

### Agent Model

- ReadAware uses one core agent that orchestrates the product's intelligence
- This agent is responsible for:
  - building and updating the user's profile
  - updating user memory over time
  - retrieving relevant book notes, highlights, and prior conversations
  - assembling the right context for the current reading moment
- Do not model the product as multiple user-visible agents unless the product direction explicitly changes

### Memory and Context

- The core system problem is memory management, not chat history management
- User-visible chat should feel continuous, but the system should not rely on dumping all prior messages into the prompt
- Treat chat transcripts as raw source material, not as the memory layer itself
- Memory is **event-sourced**. Model it in layers:
  - `raw events` — append-only, immutable; **this is the unit of sync** (see Storage Responsibilities)
  - working memory — local projection
  - long-term user memory — local projection
  - book / highlight / note memory — local projection
  - exportable context bundles — local projection
- Everything above `raw events` is a **local projection rebuilt from the event log** — projections are recomputed on-device, never synced directly. This is enforced, not aspirational: `storage/apply.rs` is the only writer of a projection row, and `rebuild_projections` can reproduce every one of them from the log. Two things are deliberately NOT derived, and both are excluded from the check: book cover artwork (extracted from object-storage content) and chat presentation state (`parts_json`, `error`)
- Design the **write / consolidation pipeline** as explicitly as retrieval; it is the harder half:
  - promotion from raw events into long-term memory (summarization / consolidation)
  - conflict resolution when new information contradicts old memory
  - decay / forgetting so memory does not grow into noise
  - dedup / entity resolution behind "repeated appearance across books or conversations"
- Memory retrieval should consider more than text-match relevance, including:
  - relevance to the current reading goal
  - recency
  - importance
  - explicit user feedback
  - repeated appearance across books or conversations

### Storage Responsibilities

- On-device `SQLite` is the source of truth for structured application data:
  - users / profile
  - books
  - highlights
  - notes
  - raw events (the append-only log)
  - memory metadata
  - context bundle versions
- **Retrieval is structured, not vector-based**: SQLite FTS + scope/recency/importance signals, plus agentic iterative search (the agent reformulates queries, walks the TOC, reads chapters). The product's unit of intelligence is the user's reading trace (annotations, questions, memories), not the book corpus — retrieval needs are deliberately lightweight
- No embedding model, no LanceDB in the default build. If FTS + agentic search ever proves insufficient, the upgrade ladder is: embed memories + annotations first, full text last — and any vector index would be a derived, rebuildable, never-synced projection
- The remote backend is **sync + relay only**, never a source of truth. Its only jobs:
  - identity / auth
  - durable storage of the (preferably E2E-encrypted) event log + large blobs (book files, derivatives) for multi-device merge and new-device bootstrap
  - a change feed to sync event logs across devices
  - optionally, an LLM proxy (to hide / meter API keys)
- The backend holds no business logic — consolidation, retrieval, and bundle assembly all run on-device
- Reach storage through a pluggable `StorageAdapter` (native filesystem + SQLite on desktop). The abstraction stays for testability and clean layering — **not** to support an in-browser engine port

### Context Portability

- Context must be dynamically updatable
- Context must be exportable at any time
- Exported context should be usable by external agents or systems
- Prefer structured context bundles over ad hoc prompt strings
- Likely bundle types include:
  - `user_profile_context`
  - `reading_intent_context`
  - `book_memory_context`
  - `conversation_insights_context`

### Platform Direction

- **Local-first**: the app must be fully usable offline against on-device data; the network is for sync and (optional) remote inference, not for core reads/writes
- **Desktop-only**: the product ships as the Tauri desktop app. The web build exists only as Tauri's bundled frontend and for local dev / Storybook — there is no standalone browser app, PWA, or in-browser storage engine
- **Verify against the desktop app, never the web build in a browser**: outside the Tauri shell the app is UI shell only — no Tauri IPC, no SQLite/FS storage, no raw-IPC book blobs — so anything exercised in a plain browser (imports, reading, persistence, CSP, AI calls) proves nothing about product behavior. Exercise changes in the running Tauri app (see the Tauri MCP bridge); anything gated on the packaged build (e.g. the production CSP) needs a real `bun run build:desktop` build
- **E2E by default**: end-to-end encrypt synced data. With no server-backed web client to feed, the server stays a dumb encrypted relay — there is no E2E-vs-web-client tradeoff to weigh
- Do not use no-code / visual agent platforms as the core product architecture
- Keep the AI layer code-first and product-native
- Prefer explicit state, explicit memory writes, and explicit retrieval pipelines over opaque agent magic

### Reader Engine Strategy

- Single reading engine: **`foliate-js`** renders every supported format —
  `EPUB`, `MOBI`, `AZW3`, `FB2`, `PDF` — under one selection / annotation / CFI /
  progress model
- The engine is **vendored**, served as a static ES-module tree from
  `apps/web/public/foliate-js` and loaded at runtime via script injection (see
  that folder's `VENDOR.md` and `features/reader/lib/foliate-engine.ts`); do not
  bundle it
- Read original files directly — **no format conversion, no Calibre, no
  normalized derivatives**. Keep only the imported source file
- Surface DRM-protected files as unsupported with explicit UX messaging

## Design System

The component library is its own package, `@read-aware/ui` (`packages/ui/`), with co-located Storybook stories. Run `bun run storybook` to browse (Storybook is hosted by `apps/web` and scans both `packages/ui` and feature stories).

### Design Tokens

Defined in `apps/web/src/index.css` via `@theme` block:
- Colors: `paper`, `paper-warm`, `border` (plus Tailwind's built-in `stone-*` palette)
- Fonts: `sans` (Inter), `serif`, `mono`
- Sizes: `text-eyebrow` (11px), `text-caption` (12px)
- Leading: `leading-display` (0.98), `leading-body` (2rem)

### Component Library

Always use these components instead of raw HTML + Tailwind classes:

**Typography:** `Display`, `Heading`, `Body`, `Eyebrow`, `Caption`
**Form controls:** `TextField`, `SearchField`, `TextArea`, `Select`, `Checkbox`, `Radio`, `Toggle`, `ChoiceGroup`
**Buttons:** `Button` (solid/outline/ghost/link/danger), `IconButton`
**Navigation:** `NavItem`, `Breadcrumb`, `Tabs`
**Data display:** `Avatar`, `Badge`, `Tag`, `Kbd`, `DefinitionList`, `Metadata`, `Metric`, `Progress`, `Quote`, `ItemList`, `Skeleton`, `Spinner`
**Layout:** `Stack`, `Columns`, `Section`, `Detail`, `Divider`, `Card` (compound: Header/Body/Footer)
**Feedback:** `Alert`, `EmptyState`, `Tooltip`
**Overlays:** `Dialog`, `Sidebar`, `DropdownMenu`, `Popover`, `Accordion`

Import from the package barrel: `import { Button, Card, Display } from "@read-aware/ui";`

### Utility

Use `cn()` from `@read-aware/ui/cn` for className composition (clsx + tailwind-merge). The `useLocalAtom` hook is available from `@read-aware/ui/state`.

### Design Principles

- Editorial restraint: no gradients, no badges, no ornamental highlights
- Paper-toned canvas, monochrome stone palette, warm and quiet
- Typography carries hierarchy; the interface stays visually spare
- Serif for display, sans for everything else
- `stone-600` minimum for text on paper backgrounds (WCAG AA)

### Iconography Rule

- Use `@phosphor-icons/react` for all product UI icons
- Do not hand-draw inline SVG icons in feature or app code
- Keep icons functional and quiet (avoid decorative icon usage)

## Project Structure

Monorepo managed by Turborepo + bun workspaces. Commands run from the repo root:
`bun run dev` (Tauri desktop), `bun run dev:web` (web only), `bun run dev:landing`,
`bun run build`, `bun run build:desktop`, `bun run storybook`, `bun run test`,
`bun run typecheck`.

Note: design-system imports use the `@read-aware/ui` package barrel, e.g.
`import { Button, Card, Display } from "@read-aware/ui";` (and `@read-aware/ui/cn`,
`@read-aware/ui/state`).

## Conventions

- Components use `forwardRef` for form controls, plain functions for everything else
- Polymorphic components use `as` prop with `ElementType` + `ComponentPropsWithRef`
- All interactive components must be keyboard-navigable with proper ARIA
- Stories co-located next to components: `Component.stories.tsx`
- Storybook hierarchy: `Design System/Components/...`, `Design System/Guidelines/...`, `Interface/...`

### Responsibility Boundaries

- Every file must have one clear responsibility. Do not let rendering, state orchestration, DOM measurement, async data flows, and pure data transforms accumulate in the same file.
- Components should focus on UI structure and prop composition. If a component starts owning non-trivial effects, async workflows, or cross-feature coordination, extract that logic into a hook.
- Hooks should own stateful client logic, browser APIs, subscriptions, measurements, and async orchestration. If the logic does not need React, it should not live in a hook.
- `lib/` and `utils/` modules should stay pure and reusable. Put formatting, derived data, mappers, and domain helpers there instead of inside components.
- Before adding new code to an existing file, first decide whether it belongs in a component, a hook, or a util. Prefer extraction over growing a mixed-responsibility file.
