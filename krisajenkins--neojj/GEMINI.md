code in this repository.

## NeoJJ - Neovim Plugin for Jujutsu VCS

NeoJJ is a Neovim plugin that provides integration with the Jujutsu (jj) version control system.

## Development Setup

The project uses Nix for development environment. Always enter the Nix shell before development:

```bash
nix develop
```

This provides:

- luacheck (static analysis)
- stylua (code formatting)
- lua-language-server (type checking)
- neovim (testing)

## Common Development Commands

```bash
# Run all checks and tests
make

# Run tests only
make test

# Run a specific test file
make test_file FILE=tests/test_components.lua

# Run linting/static analysis
make typecheck

# Format code
make format
```

## Documentation

### Regenerating Help Tags

After modifying documentation in `doc/`, regenerate the help tags file:

```bash
# From within Neovim
:helptags doc/

# Or from command line
nvim --headless -c "helptags doc/" -c "quit"
```

The `doc/tags` file is tracked in git and should be updated when documentation changes.

## Architecture Overview

### Core Components

1. **UI Component System** (`lua/neojj/lib/ui/`)
   - `component.lua`: Defines the component abstraction with support for folding, interactivity, and custom options
   - `renderer.lua`: Renders components to buffer lines with proper highlight tracking
   - Components are immutable data structures with methods for querying properties

2. **Buffer Management** (`lua/neojj/lib/buffer.lua`)
   - Manages Neovim buffers with component rendering support
   - Handles buffer lifecycle, options, and cursor management
   - Integrates with the renderer for displaying UI components

3. **JJ Integration** (`lua/neojj/lib/jj/`)
   - `cli.lua`: Executes jj commands and parses output
   - `repository.lua`: Repository abstraction with caching and state management
   - `status.lua`: Parses jj status output into structured data
   - Uses async execution with plenary for non-blocking operations

   **Repository resolution is per-buffer.** A `:JJ` command targets the repo
   owning the *current buffer*, not Neovim's working directory, so one session
   can drive several jj projects. `M.get_repo(dir)` is the single resolution
   point: a nil `dir` resolves via `M.current_buffer_dir()`, so **every** entry
   is buffer-aware — the `:JJ` dispatcher (which passes an explicit dir), a
   leader mapping wired straight to `neojj.jj_log` (which calls it with no args,
   so `dir` is nil), or any future caller. `current_buffer_dir()` resolves in
   priority order:
   1. `b:neojj_repo_dir` — a buffer-local tag every NeoJJ view sets to its repo
      root (in `Buffer.create`, from the `cwd = repo.dir` each view passes).
      This is why a `:JJ` command run *inside* a view (which is a `nofile`
      buffer with no path) stays on that view's repo instead of falling back.
   2. The directory of a normal file buffer's file.
   3. `getcwd()` for anything else (terminals, `[No Name]`).

   `JjRepo.instance()` then keys its instance cache by the repository **root**
   (resolved with `util.find_jj_dir`), so all buffers/subdirectories of one repo
   share a single `JjRepo` (and watcher).

4. **Status Buffer** (`lua/neojj/buffers/status/`)
   - `ui.lua`: Creates the component tree for displaying jj status
   - `init.lua`: Manages the status buffer lifecycle and updates
   - Provides interactive UI for viewing repository state

### Key Design Patterns

- **Component-Based UI**: All UI elements are components that can be composed hierarchically
- **Immutable Data**: Components and state are immutable for predictable rendering
- **Async Operations**: JJ commands run asynchronously to avoid blocking the editor
- **Caching**: Repository state is cached to minimize jj command executions
- **Interactive Components**: Components can be marked as `interactive = true` to support cursor-based interaction

### View Stack (`lua/neojj/lib/view_stack.lua`)

Drilling down (log → a change's status → a file) builds a stack of **live**
views. Rather than snapshot each view's (cursor, revision, folds) and re-render
on the way back, the stack keeps every view's buffer alive (they use
`bufhidden = "hide"`) and just switches the shared window between them, so Vim
preserves cursor/fold/scroll state for free.

- `q` / `<esc>` on a NeoJJ view pops one frame, revealing the frame beneath;
  popping the last frame closes the view.
- No-arg `:JJ` returns to the stack from anywhere (raises the top frame; from a
  file opened out of a status view it steps back into that status view).
- A view registers itself as a frame from its `show`/`show_split`/`show_tab`
  entry points (`StatusBuffer:_push_frame` / `LogBuffer:_push_frame`); opening a
  file from the status view pushes a file frame.

**Only log, status and file views are stack frames today.** describe, annotate
and the split terminal are transient and are NOT pushed. **When adding a new
buffer type, consider whether it should be a stack frame** — if it is a view the
user navigates *into* and expects to `q`/`:JJ` back out of, push it onto the
view stack; if it is a transient editor/terminal, leave it off.

### Component Position Tracking System

The renderer tracks the position of interactive components to enable cursor-based interactions:

1. **Renderer** (`lua/neojj/lib/ui/renderer.lua`):
   - Tracks interactive components by line number during rendering
   - Returns `component_positions` table mapping line numbers to components
   - Uses 0-indexed line numbers internally

2. **Buffer** (`lua/neojj/lib/buffer.lua`):
   - Stores component positions from renderer
   - `get_component_at_cursor()` finds the component at cursor position
   - Searches backwards from cursor line to find the nearest interactive component

3. **Interactive Components**:
   - Created with `interactive = true` option
   - Store associated data in `item` field (e.g., file paths, commit data)
   - Accessed via `component:get_item()` method

### Status Buffer Keybindings

- `j` / `k`: Navigate up/down (standard vim navigation also works)
- `<cr>`: Open file at cursor (if on a file entry)
- `<tab>`: Toggle the diff for the file at cursor (inline by default; opens a
  side-by-side native-diff float pair when `config.diff.inline == false`, with
  unchanged regions collapsed unless `config.diff.fold == false` — see
  `lua/neojj/buffers/status/diff_float.lua`)
- `<s-tab>`: Toggle all file diffs
- `r` / `<c-r>`: Refresh status buffer
- `d`: Describe current commit
- `c`: Commit change (describe `@`, then `jj new` onto a fresh empty working copy)
- `n`: Create a new change from the current commit
- `S`: Squash the working copy `@` into its parent (confirms first)
- `R`: Rebase the working copy `@` onto a chosen destination (select `-r`/`-s`/`-b`, default `-s`)
- `x`: Discard the file at cursor via `jj restore`, or restore all changes when not on a file (`@`, or the pinned revision when one is shown; confirms first)
- `f`: Run jj fix (format working copy `@`)
- `t`: Tug (advance the closest bookmark up to `@`)
- `P`: Push to remote (`jj git push`)
- `p`: Pull from remote (`jj git fetch`)
- `l`: Open the log view
- `o`: Open the operation log view
- `q` / `<c-c>` / `<esc>`: Back (pop the view stack) / close
- `?`: Toggle the help panel

Keep this list in sync with `StatusBuffer:_setup_mappings()` in
`lua/neojj/buffers/status/init.lua` — it is the source of truth. The user-facing
tables in `README.md` and `doc/neojj.txt` must match too.

## Testing with MiniTest

### Test Structure

```lua
local T = MiniTest.new_set()
local expect = MiniTest.expect

T.test_name = function()
  -- Test code here
end

return T
```

### Integration Tests with Child Neovim

```lua
local child = MiniTest.new_child_neovim()

T.test_with_child = function()
  child.lua([[
    -- Code runs in child neovim
    expect = require('mini.test').expect
  ]])
end
```

### Key Assertions

- `expect.equality(actual, expected)` - Test equality
- `expect.no_equality(actual, expected)` - Test inequality
- `expect.error(function() ... end)` - Test that function throws error
- `expect.no_error(function() ... end)` - Test that function doesn't throw error

Note: When using `expect` inside `child.lua()` blocks, you must make it available with `expect = require('mini.test').expect`

## Code Style

- Max line length: 120 characters
- Use LuaJIT standard library
- Follow existing patterns for component creation and buffer management
- All new code must pass luacheck static analysis

## Adding New Interactive Features

To add new interactive features to buffers:

1. **Create Interactive Components**:

   ```lua
   local component = Ui.file_item(status, path, {
       item = { path = "file.txt", status = "M" },
       interactive = true,
   })
   ```

2. **Add Keybindings** in buffer `_setup_mappings()`:

   ```lua
   self.buffer:map("n", "<key>", function()
       self:action_method()
   end, { desc = "Action description" })
   ```

3. **Implement Action Methods**:
   ```lua
   function BufferClass:action_method()
       local component = self.buffer:get_component_at_cursor()
       if component and component:is_interactive() then
           local item = component:get_item()
           -- Process the item data
       end
   end
   ```
