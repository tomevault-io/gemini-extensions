# AGENTS.md — set up KHMS memory for yourself, in one pass

You are an agent that has been told: *"set up your memory per this repo."* This file is the
whole job. Work top to bottom. Everything you need is in this repository; nothing here needs
network access, a database, or a service.

Before you start, know the two rules that outrank convenience:

1. **You may not write into `memory/know/` without your operator's approval.** Background
   stages propose; approval is a separate, human-or-strong-model step. This is what keeps a
   fabricated card from becoming a remembered fact.
2. **Cards are immutable once approved.** You will be tempted to "just fix" one. Don't. Write
   a new card that supersedes it. The wrong old card is evidence about how you were wrong.

---

## Step 1 — Decide where memory lives, and set `KHMS_ROOT`

Pick a directory *outside* the code you work on — memory outlives any one project. Everything
below is relative to it. Every script in `tools/` reads the environment variable `KHMS_ROOT`
and falls back to its own parent directory, so a copied `tools/` directory works with no edits.

```bash
export KHMS_ROOT="$HOME/.agent-memory"      # put this in your shell profile too
```

Create the layout and copy the tooling:

```bash
git clone <this-repo> /tmp/khms && /tmp/khms/tools/khms_init.sh "$KHMS_ROOT"
```

`khms_init.sh` is idempotent: it creates the directories, the ID counter, an empty tag
registry, and copies `tools/` and `tools/prompts/` into `$KHMS_ROOT`. It writes nothing into
`memory/know/`.

Resulting layout — memorize it, you will refer to it constantly:

```
$KHMS_ROOT/
  MEMORY.md                 generated index; keep this in your context always (≤80 lines)
  memory/know/K-*.md        the cards — one claim per file, immutable
  memory/views/             generated: topics/<tag>.md, by-type/<type>.md, tags.md, recent.md
  memory/inbox/             proposals awaiting review (temp labels, no IDs yet)
  memory/inbox/.staging/    what each pipeline stage was actually handed (forensics)
  memory/archive/know/      superseded and condensed cards — "fog", still greppable
  journal/YYYY-MM-DD.md     what happened today, written as it happens
  tools/                    the scripts below; tools/.next_id is the ID counter
```

## Step 2 — Learn the card format (this is the part you must not improvise)

One card = one file = one claim. Read [spec/khms-spec.md](spec/khms-spec.md) §4 once in full;
this is the operational summary.

SYMPTOM: ...
CAUSE: ...
FIX: ...
VERIFIED: ...
```

| `type` | use when | body template | level |
|---|---|---|---|
| `action→outcome` | an attempt had a result (worked, failed, partial) | `WHEN:` `THEN:` | observation |
| `problem→solution` | a symptom was diagnosed and the fix verified | `SYMPTOM:` `CAUSE:` `FIX:` `VERIFIED:` | observation |
| `fact` | static reality with exact values (IDs, addresses, configs, external findings) | free statement | observation |
| `requirement` | someone stated a need | `WHO:` `WHAT:` `WHY:` `DONE-CRITERIA:` | observation |
| `decision→rationale` | an alternative was chosen | `DECIDED:` `WHY:` `REJECTED:` | observation |
| `principle` | ≥2 independent observations share a shape | `HOLDS:` `LIMITS:` `IMPLICATIONS:` | derived |
| `policy` | a way of working is adopted | `RULE:` `LIMITS:` `IMPLICATIONS:` | derived |
| `goal→method` | a repeatable method exists | `GOAL:` `METHOD:` `PREREQUISITES:` `COST:` | derived |
| `overview` | a topic needs an anchor and a map | short narrative + links | derived |

Four rules that decide most edge cases:

- **Descriptive and normative never share a card.** What happened is an observation; what to
  do about it is a `derived` card linked by `derived_from`. A recommendation can die without
  killing the fact under it, and one fact can feed two competing recommendations.
- **Observations need `evidence` and `source`; derived cards need non-empty `derived_from`.**
  `build_views.py` exits non-zero if you break this, so a broken card cannot ship silently.
- **`measured` means you did it and saw the result.** Something a person told you, or a vendor
  document says, or a paper claims, is `reported` — even when you are sure it is true.
- **One card, one claim.** If the body needs "and also", it is two cards.

Working examples of every shape: [examples/](examples/).

## Step 3 — Bootstrap the two cards the system needs about itself

The knowledge base must contain its own instructions, because that is the copy retrieval can
serve you later. Copy `spec/khms-spec.md` into a `policy` card (`tags: [khms, core]`,
`level: derived`) and `spec/bootstrap-digest.md` into a second one. Then:

```bash
"$KHMS_ROOT/tools/build_views.py"     # validates every card, regenerates views + MEMORY.md
```

`MEMORY.md` is generated — never edit it by hand, and never edit anything in `memory/views/`.
Its §1 is the body of the bootstrap-digest card, so the retrieval rules travel with the index
that is always in your context.

## Step 4 — Capture during work: the MARK convention

You will not remember at 23:00 what you decided at 09:00, and a summary written at the end of
a session is a summary of what you still remember, which is the wrong sample. So capture as it
happens, cheaply, into `journal/YYYY-MM-DD.md`:

```
MARK[decision] switched to polling the sensor at 1 Hz — bus contention above that (sess a1b2)
MARK[failed]   tried raising the timeout to 5 s; same checksum errors (sess a1b2)
MARK[req]      operator wants the daily report to state the battery percentage (sess a1b2)
MARK[solved]   checksum errors were a loose ground, not a timing problem (sess a1b2)
```

One line per decision, stated requirement, failed attempt, solved problem. Kinds are open;
those four cover most of it. Write a **full card inline** only when the knowledge is `measured`
*and* immediately reusable; everything else is the nightly sweep's job, and the MARKs tell it
where to dig. A MARK costs you one line; a lost decision costs a re-derivation.

## Step 5 — Retrieval: a floor you install and a ceiling you owe

**The floor** is mechanical. Hooks call `khms_hook.py` on session start, on every operator
message, before file edits and shell commands, and after failed tool calls; it scores the text
against the card base and injects at most a couple of cards, under a budget. It runs whether or
not you remember it exists. Install it per [claude-code/README.md](claude-code/README.md).

**The ceiling is your duty, and the floor does not discharge it:**

- Run `tools/recall.sh "<symptom or error string or identifier>"` **before you root-cause
  anything**. Paste the artifact you actually have — the error text, the odd number, the
  parameter name. This is deliberately not tag-based: classifying the situation correctly is
  exactly what fails when you are lost.
- Run `tools/recall.sh "<what you are about to propose>"` **before you state a hypothesis or
  propose a change**. The proposal is the moment when repeating a documented dead end is most
  expensive, and the hook cannot fire on what you have not yet said.
- Run `tools/precheck.sh <tag> [tag...]` **before a risky action** (deleting things, changing
  configuration, writing to hardware, deploying). Zero model tokens: it prints active policies,
  gotchas, and refuted dead ends for those tags. The hook also runs it automatically for a
  named class of dangerous commands — that automation is a backstop, not a substitute.
- **An injected card is a pointer, not an answer.** If it is relevant, open the file and follow
  its links (`derived_from`, `supports`, `contradicts`, and any `[[K-…]]` in the body).
- **"Nothing on record" is a real and useful answer.** Say it rather than inventing coverage.

Retrieval ladder, cheapest first — go down it in order:
`MEMORY.md` (already in context) → `memory/views/topics/<tag>.md` → `precheck.sh` →
`recall.sh` / grep `memory/know/` → fog (`memory/archive/`) → **external sources** (vendor
docs, manuals, papers, web). The last rung is *mandatory* when you are about to assert a fact
no `measured` card covers. External findings come back as `reported` observations with the URL
and a locating quote in `source`.

## Step 6 — The write path: propose → consolidate → approve

Nothing writes into `memory/know/` except the approval step. The pipeline exists so that the
expensive attention is spent only where it is needed.

1. **Nightly sweep** (`tools/nightly_distill.sh`, cron ~03:30). Deterministic inputs first, at
   zero model cost: `preprocess_transcripts.py` turns session transcripts into a digest of
   message texts, tool names and errors; the journal files touched since the last run; the
   day's git log. A cheap model extracts candidate cards (over-generation is fine), each
   carrying a `**QUOTES:**` block whose lines must occur *verbatim* in a named source.
2. **Mechanical grounding check** (`tools/verify_quotes.py`, zero model cost). Greps every
   quote against the source it names, and flags every specific (number, identifier, log string)
   that no quote backs. Its report is an input to the next stage. This is the difference
   between asking a model not to fabricate and checking that it did not.
3. **Consolidate** (mid-tier model). Enforces the grounding report mechanically (unfound quote
   → the claim goes; unbacked specific → the specific goes; no quotes → the card goes),
   deduplicates, enforces schema, links candidates to existing cards, flags contradictions and
   status-change proposals. Writes `memory/inbox/DATE.md`. Still no IDs, still no authority.
4. **Morning review** (you, in a full session, at the start of the day). Read the `## Flagged`
   section with real attention; approve or fix the rest quickly. Then:

   ```bash
   "$KHMS_ROOT/tools/approve_inbox.py" "$KHMS_ROOT/memory/inbox/$(date +%F).md"
   "$KHMS_ROOT/tools/build_views.py"
   ```

   `approve_inbox.py` allocates the sequential IDs from `tools/.next_id`, rewrites temp
   cross-references, and writes the cards. It exits non-zero if any card failed to parse —
   treat a partial import as a failure, never as a finished one. It also **refuses the whole
   run, before allocating any ID, when a card says it corrects something without naming what**
   (`tools/khms_lint.py`): add the `contradicts` / `supersedes` / `refuted_by` edge it asks for
   and re-run. A correction only prose can see is one your retrieval will never reach. Finish
   with a two-sentence report to your operator in their language.
5. **Weekly synthesis** (`tools/weekly_synthesis.sh`, cron Sunday ~04:00) + weekly review.
   Proposes `principle` cards where three or more observations share a shape, puts contradicting
   patterns side by side with the cheapest experiment that would discriminate them, and ranks
   condensation candidates. Condensing is not deleting: the absorbing pattern must carry the
   information, and the absorbed card moves to `memory/archive/know/`, still greppable.

**Review is also where you analyze your own mistakes.** Not just the cards: what went wrong
that day, why, and what mechanism — not what intention — would have prevented it. If the same
mistake recurs, the previous countermeasure was wrong; choose a different one, of a different
kind. "I will be more careful" is not a countermeasure. A countermeasure is a step that either
happened or did not, and that leaves a trace showing which.

## Step 7 — Verify the install

```bash
"$KHMS_ROOT/tools/build_views.py"                 # -> "OK: N cards …"; non-zero = schema break
"$KHMS_ROOT/tools/recall.sh" checksum mismatch    # -> ranked cards, or "nothing on record"
"$KHMS_ROOT/tools/precheck.sh" sensors            # -> policies/gotchas, or "nothing on record"
echo '{"hook_event_name":"UserPromptSubmit","prompt":"why do the checksums keep failing","session_id":"t1"}' \
  | python3 "$KHMS_ROOT/tools/khms_hook.py"       # -> JSON with additionalContext, or nothing
tail -3 "$KHMS_ROOT/tools/.inject.log"            # -> one line per hook firing, with the reason
```

The audit log is not decoration. A hook that silently stops firing looks exactly like a quiet
day, so every firing records what it searched, what the top hit scored, and why anything above
the bar was *not* injected (`dedup`, `cap`, `threshold`). Kill switch, when the injections are
in your way: `touch "$KHMS_ROOT/tools/.hooks-off"` (or `KHMS_HOOKS_OFF=1`).

## Step 8 — Calibrate, and keep the numbers out of the rules

Every number in this system is configuration, not law: injection thresholds, the rate cap, the
dedup TTL, evidence weights, the belief slope. They are listed in one place —
[spec/khms-spec.md](spec/khms-spec.md) §7 — with the values a real deployment converged on.
Change them from measurements in your own `.inject.log` and `.recall.log`, and record the
change as a card. Never encode a calibrated number as a rule, and never store a live tunable's
current *value* in a card body: the card cannot notice when the value moves, so it silently
becomes misinformation. Store where the value lives, not what it is.

## What "done" looks like

- `$KHMS_ROOT` exists with the layout of Step 1; `build_views.py` exits 0.
- `MEMORY.md` is generated and is in your context; you have never edited it by hand.
- The spec and the bootstrap digest exist as cards, tagged `core`.
- Hooks are wired and `.inject.log` is growing.
- Today's journal has MARK lines in it.
- Your first inbox has been produced by a nightly run, reviewed by a human, and approved.
