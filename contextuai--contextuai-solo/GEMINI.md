# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

ContextuAI Solo is a single-user desktop AI assistant with 96 pre-built business agents (108 in repo, engineering and coder-companion categories excluded from desktop's main library). It's a Tauri v2 desktop app with a React 19 frontend and a FastAPI Python backend running as a sidecar process. Data is stored locally in SQLite. Supports cloud providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google Gemini, AWS Bedrock, Ollama) and local GGUF models via llama-cpp-python. The shell has two top-level modes — **Solo** (business assistant) and **Coder** (local coding workspace) — toggled from a top-center pill in the title bar (`Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+M`).

## Commands

### Frontend (run from `frontend/`)
```bash
npm install                  # Install dependencies
npm run dev                  # Vite dev server on port 1420
npm run build                # TypeScript check + Vite production build
npm run tauri dev            # Run full Tauri desktop app (dev mode)
npm run tauri build          # Build platform installers (.exe/.msi)
npx playwright test          # Run E2E tests (requires dev server running)
npx playwright test tests/e2e/some-test.spec.ts  # Run a single test
```

### Backend (run from `backend/`)
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt   # Install dependencies
CONTEXTUAI_MODE=desktop uvicorn app:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 18741 --reload  # Dev server
pytest tests/ -v                  # Run backend tests
```

### Quick Start
```bash
./run.sh                     # Creates venv, installs deps, starts backend
# Then in another terminal: cd frontend && npm run dev
```

### Docker
```bash
docker compose up            # Starts backend only; run frontend separately
```

## Architecture

### Three-Layer Desktop App
```
Tauri Shell (Rust)  →  React SPA (port 1420)  →  FastAPI Sidecar (port 18741)
```

- **Tauri shell** (`frontend/src-tauri/src/`): Window management, system tray, sidecar process lifecycle. `main.rs` boots the app, `sidecar.rs` spawns/health-checks the backend, `commands.rs` provides IPC handlers.
- **React frontend** (`frontend/src/`): Routes in `routes/`, reusable UI in `components/ui/`, API clients in `lib/api/`, transport layer in `lib/transport.ts`.
- **FastAPI backend** (`backend/`): Entry point is `app.py`. Routers in `routers/`, business logic in `services/`, data access in `repositories/`, adapters in `adapters/`.

### Frontend-Backend Communication
- **Tauri mode**: React → Tauri IPC (`api_request` command) → HTTP to sidecar
- **Dev mode**: React → direct HTTP fetch to `http://127.0.0.1:18741/api/v1`
- **Streaming**: Always SSE over HTTP (not IPC), consumed via `streamRequest()` in `transport.ts`. Supports `AbortSignal` for cancelling mid-stream.
- Retry logic: 5 attempts with exponential backoff
- **Stream abort**: Frontend uses `AbortController` to cancel HTTP fetch on stop. Backend `LocalModelService` has `asyncio.Lock` to prevent concurrent model access — second request waits for first to finish/abort.

### Database: SQLite with MongoDB-Compatible API
The backend was ported from MongoDB. A compatibility layer preserves the Motor API:
- `adapters/sqlite_adapter.py` — Async SQLite wrapper (aiosqlite)
- `adapters/motor_compat.py` — `DatabaseProxy`/`CollectionProxy` that mimic Motor's `AsyncIOMotorDatabase`/`AsyncIOMotorCollection`
- Tables use `_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY, data JSON NOT NULL` pattern — documents stored as JSON blobs
- MongoDB query operators (`$set`, `$in`, `$regex`, `$gt`, etc.) are translated to SQL/JSON expressions
- DB path: `~/.contextuai-solo/data/contextuai.db`

### Backend Patterns
- **Repository pattern**: `repositories/*.py` — Generic async CRUD via `BaseRepository<T>`
- **Service layer**: `services/*.py` — Business logic injected with repositories via FastAPI `Depends()`
- **Workspace orchestration**: `services/workspace/orchestrator.py` polls job queue, `agent_runner.py` executes individual agents, `checkpoint_service.py` handles pause/resume
- **Crew system**: Multi-agent teams with persistent memory (`crew_memory_service.py`)

### Local AI Models (`backend/routers/local_models.py`)
GGUF models downloaded from HuggingFace, stored in `~/.contextuai-solo/models/`. Inference via llama-cpp-python, with automatic GPU offload (Apple Metal / NVIDIA CUDA / Vulkan) when the installed build supports it, falling back to CPU. Offload is gated by `llama_cpp.llama_supports_gpu_offload()` and tunable via the `LOCAL_MODEL_GPU_LAYERS` env var (`auto` (default) / `0` to force CPU / `<N>` layers); the loaded model stays resident in RAM across messages and only reloads on a model swap.
- 41 curated GGUF models (Gemma 4, Qwen 3/3.5, DeepSeek R1, Llama 3, Mistral, Phi-4, etc.) from 0.5B to 70B
- Download: `POST /api/v1/local-models/{model_id}/download` (SSE progress)
- Sync to DB: `POST /api/v1/local-models/sync` (registers downloaded models in the `models` collection)
- Models appear in chat dropdown after sync

### Agent Library (`agent-library/`)
113 markdown agents across 14 categories. The 12 `engineering` agents and the 5 `coder-companion` agents (`code-reviewer`, `bug-analyzer`, `test-writer`, `doc-generator`, `refactor-advisor`) are excluded from the Solo agent library — coder-companion agents only surface in Coder mode (`kind="coder"`). Solo users see **96 agents** across 12 business categories. Each markdown file contains a system prompt, recommended model, and tool configs. Auto-seeded into `workspace_agents` collection on first startup with a `kind` field (see Agents-by-Kind below). Re-seed via `POST /api/v1/desktop/reseed`.

### Agents-by-Kind (Phase 4 PR 2 — Personas folded in)
Personas no longer exist as a separate concept. Each persona row is now a `workspace_agents` row with a `kind` field:
- `prompt` — the 96 business agents from the markdown library (system prompt only)
- `database` — PostgreSQL / MySQL / MSSQL / Snowflake / MongoDB connectors
- `web` — Web Researcher
- `mcp` — MCP Server
- `api` — API Connector
- `file` — File Operations
- `coder` — Coder mode companion agents (hidden from Solo)

`backend/migrations/personas_to_agent_types_migration.py` promotes each legacy persona row into `workspace_agents` preserving its `persona_id` so existing crews still resolve. The library picker (`components/agents/agent-library-tabs.tsx`) is **tabbed by kind** with per-kind counts; the Crew builder uses the same picker in compact mode. `GET /api/v1/workspace/agents?kind=<x>` and `GET /api/v1/workspace/agents/kinds/counts` drive the UI. `/personas` still routes for one release with a "Personas have moved" banner pointing to `/agents`.

### Crew System
Multi-agent teams with persistent memory. Crew builder (`components/crews/crew-builder.tsx`) is a 7-step wizard:
1. **Details** — name, description, blueprint, AI model selection
2. **Execution Mode** — sequential, parallel, pipeline, autonomous
3. **Agent Team** — add agents from the 96-agent library (tabbed by `kind`) or manually. Step types include the new `coder_project` step (Phase 4 PR 9) that runs a Coder project headlessly inside the crew flow.
4. **Connections & Directions** — bind crew to channels with per-connection direction chip (`Inbound` / `Outbound` / `Both`)
5. **Trigger** — reactive (keywords/hashtags/mentions) and/or scheduled (cron or one-shot date); manual is always implicit
6. **Approval** — toggle `approval_required` to hold outbound in the Approvals queue before sending
7. **Review & Create** — configuration summary before create

Connection bindings stored as `connection_bindings[]` on the crew document (`ConnectionBinding` model: `connection_id`, `platform`, `direction`). `triggers[]` holds reactive and scheduled trigger configs. Crew-level model selection applies to all agents in the crew. Crew rows now carry `kind: "crew" | "project"` (Phase 4 PR 3 — Workspace folded in); `backend/migrations/workspace_to_crew_runs_migration.py` migrates legacy `workspace_projects` → `crews` rows with `kind="project"` and legacy `workspace_jobs` → `crew_runs`. The Crews page exposes tabs `Crews | Projects | Runs`.

### Blueprint Library (`blueprints/`)
10 pre-built workflow templates across 5 categories (strategy, content, marketing, product, research). Markdown files auto-seeded into `blueprints` collection on startup. Integrated into crew builder and workspace project dialog via `BlueprintSelector` component. API: `GET /api/v1/blueprints/`, `GET /api/v1/blueprints/{id}`.

### Knowledge Base / RAG (`routers/knowledge_base.py`, `services/rag_service.py`)
Local-only retrieval-augmented generation. Users create knowledge bases at `/knowledge`, upload PDFs / DOCX / TXT / MD, and the documents are chunked (~500 tokens, 50 overlap, page-tracked for PDFs), embedded with the bundled all-MiniLM-L6-v2 ONNX model (384-dim, unit-normalised), and persisted as JSON arrays in SQLite (`kb_documents` + `kb_chunks` collections). Retrieval is numpy dot-product (= cosine for unit vectors); top-k MMR not yet implemented. The chat input has a "Knowledge" dropdown — when a KB is selected, `ai_chat.py` runs a query, prepends the formatted citations to the prompt for both local and Bedrock paths, and instructs the model to cite `[1]`, `[2]`, etc. REST API: `GET/POST /api/v1/knowledge-bases`, `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/v1/knowledge-bases/{id}`, `GET/POST /api/v1/knowledge-bases/{id}/documents` (multipart upload), `DELETE /api/v1/knowledge-bases/{id}/documents/{doc_id}`, `POST /api/v1/knowledge-bases/{id}/query`. Chat request body accepts `knowledge_base_id` (optional). Pre-built RAG packs live under `knowledge-base-packs/` for users to download (e.g. IRS tax docs, personal finance, cybersecurity); each pack is a folder of source files plus a `manifest.json`.

### Personal Docs / Folder Mappings (`routers/personal_docs.py`, `services/personal_docs_service.py`)
A KB can also have folder sources: pick any folder via the Tauri dialog plugin (`tauri-plugin-dialog`, exposed through `lib/tauri-fs.ts`), the backend walks it (depth + glob filtered; supported extensions `.pdf .docx .txt .md .html .htm .rtf .csv .json`), classifies new / updated / removed files vs. existing docs by `(abs_path, size, mtime)`, and re-uses the same chunk → embed → query pipeline. Backed by two new collections: `kb_folder_sources` (one row per mapping) and `kb_index_jobs` (one row per sync run with progress + error fields). Manual "Sync now" plus a per-mapping schedule (`manual` / `1h` / `6h` / `24h`) honoured by `services/personal_docs_scheduler.py`. Walks above the friction threshold (default 1,000 files) pause the job in `awaiting_confirmation` so the UI can show ETA and require explicit confirm before any embeddings are computed. Hard caps: 10 MB / file, 5,000 files / mapping, depth 10 — overridable per mapping or via env (`PERSONAL_DOCS_MAX_*`). Crews and workspace agents bind to KBs via `knowledge_base_ids: string[]` (per-agent overrides crew default); `services/workspace/agent_runner.py` queries those KBs each turn and prepends a citation block to the system prompt. UI lives at `/knowledge/<kb_id>` under a new "Folders" tab next to "Documents" + "Test Query"; SSE stream at `/api/v1/personal-docs/jobs/{job_id}/stream` drives the live progress panel.

### Reddit Connection (`routers/reddit.py`, `services/reddit_poller.py`)
Inbound polling via praw (Reddit API wrapper). `RedditPoller` runs a 60s background loop, fetching new comments from configured subreddits (filtered by keywords) and inbox DMs. Dispatches through `channel_service.handle_message()` so triggers + approval pipeline apply. Account config stored in `reddit_accounts` collection. REST API: `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/v1/reddit/account`, `POST /api/v1/reddit/test`, `POST /api/v1/reddit/reply`.

### Connections / Distributions (`routes/connections.tsx`)
10 platform integrations displayed under the sidebar label **Distributions** (URL remains `/connections`). Seven social platforms: Telegram, Discord, Reddit (inbound + outbound), LinkedIn, Twitter/X, Instagram, Facebook (outbound-only). Three outbound-only channels: Blog (Ghost/WordPress/custom), Email (SendGrid/SES/SMTP), Slack Webhook. Token-paste flow for Telegram/Discord/Twitter/Reddit; OAuth2 flow for LinkedIn/Instagram/Facebook; API-key/webhook-URL for Blog/Email/Slack.

### Authentication
Desktop mode uses a static admin user — no login required. Auth is bypassed via dependency overrides in `app.py`. The `auth_service.py` has Cognito JWT support for the enterprise edition.

### Automations (`routers/automations.py`, `services/automation_engine.py`)
Natural-language `@agent`-mention workflows — the low-friction alternative to the 7-step crew wizard. Lives at `/automations` (sidebar entry). User writes a prompt with `@agent-handle` mentions, the parser (`automation_parser.py`) resolves agents and infers execution mode (sequential / parallel), and the engine runs the dispatch. Output actions: chat-only, PDF (reportlab), PPTX (python-pptx), Markdown, or any of the existing Distribution adapters (LinkedIn / Twitter / IG / FB / Slack / Email / Blog). SSE progress at `POST /api/v1/automations/{id}/run` → `GET /api/v1/automations/executions/{id}/stream`. "Promote to Crew" converts an Automation into a scheduled crew. Frontend: `components/automations/automation-builder.tsx` + `output-action-picker.tsx`.

### Coder Mode (`routers/coder_projects.py`, `routers/coder_workflow.py`, `services/coder_*`)
Local, free coding workspace — Phase 4 PR 6 MVP, Phase 5 multi-agent. Switched via the top-center mode pill (see Shell Mode Toggle below). Routes live under `/coder/*` and have their own 5-item sidebar (Projects, Running, Templates, Models, Settings — see `components/navigation/desktop-sidebar-coder.tsx`).
- **Projects** (`coder_project_service.py`): scaffold from one of 4 templates (`coder-templates/web-app`, `telegram-bot`, `cli-tool`, `static-site`), trust state per project, allowlisted shell exec, scoped FS via Tauri capabilities.
- **Runs** (`coder_run_service.py`): SSE stdout stream, kill, list-running. `run_headless()` is exposed for crew-step + automation handoffs.
- **Roles & presets** (`coder_role_preset_service.py`, `coder_agent_role_repository.py`): per-project agent roles (planner / coder / reviewer / etc.) with presets for the multi-agent workflow.
- **Workflow** (`coder_workflow_service.py`): solo / sequential / parallel / custom execution modes across roles. `routers/coder_workflow.py` exposes config + run-preview + start endpoints. Mode migration: `backend/migrations/coder_workflow_mode_migration.py`.
- **Model picking**: `model-picker.tsx` (project-creation dialog) pulls from `/v1/models` via the universal dispatcher (`backend/services/model_dispatcher.py`). No silent fallbacks — picks fail fast if the chosen provider key is missing.
- **Coder-companion agents** (`agent-library/coder-companion/`): 5 agents (code-reviewer, bug-analyzer, test-writer, doc-generator, refactor-advisor) with `kind="coder"` so they only appear in Coder mode. Right-click a file → "Review with code-reviewer" / "Add tests with test-writer".

### Cross-Mode Handoffs (Phase 4 PR 7, Phase 5 PR 9)
- `OutputActionType.RUN_CODER_PROJECT` — Automation output action that invokes a Coder project headlessly.
- New crew step type `coder_project` — Crews can include a Coder run as a step (see `backend/tests/test_crew_coder_step.py`).
- Coder project menu → "Index as KB" reuses the Personal Docs folder-mapping pipeline.
- Coder error → "Diagnose with @bug-analyzer" deep-links into Solo chat.

### Shell Mode Toggle (`contexts/mode-context.tsx`, `components/shell/mode-toggle.tsx`)
Top-center segmented pill switches between `solo` and `coder`. State persists in localStorage (`solo.app.mode`); Tauri window title updates via `window-title.tsx`. The `ModeRouter` in `App.tsx` keeps URL and mode in sync (deep-linking to `/coder/*` flips mode on refresh; toggling mode navigates to the right home route). `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+M` toggles. `DesktopLayout` swaps between `desktop-sidebar.tsx` (Solo) and `desktop-sidebar-coder.tsx` (Coder). Coder can be disabled from Settings → AI Providers (kill switch hides the toggle).

### Cloud Providers (`routers/cloud_providers.py`, `services/cloud_provider_service.py`)
Saved cloud API keys actually drive inference (Phase 4 PR 8). Settings → **AI Providers** tab shows a Distributions-style onboarding card per provider (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Bedrock, Ollama, and a generic **OpenAI-Compatible** type for any `/v1` server — vLLM / LM Studio / llama.cpp server / TGI / LiteLLM / OpenRouter, `base_url` required + optional key) with paste-key + test-connection flow (`components/cloud-providers/cloud-provider-card.tsx`, `provider-card.tsx`, `data/provider-guides.ts`). `CloudProviderType` (`models/cloud_provider_models.py`) enumerates the six types. Keys live in the `cloud_provider_keys` collection. `services/cloud_model_seeder.py` registers each provider's models into the `models` collection on key-save — Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google (and any `openai_compat` server) are discovered **live** from the account's model-list endpoint so the list never rots, with static-catalog / preserve-on-failure fallback — Google filters `/v1beta/models` to Gemini models supporting `generateContent`. The unified `services/model_dispatcher.py` routes `anthropic:` / `openai:` / `openai_compat:` / `google:` / `bedrock:` / `ollama:` / bare local model IDs to the correct direct service; adaptive param retry drops deprecated sampling params (`temperature` / `top_p` / `topP`) on a 400 across the Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google direct services.

### OpenAI-Compatible API (`routers/openai_compat.py`)
`GET /v1/models` and `POST /v1/chat/completions` expose **all** installed models — local GGUF, plus every cloud provider with a saved key — through the same OpenAI-shaped surface. Point Aider, Continue.dev, Cursor, or any OpenAI-compat client at `http://localhost:18741/v1`. Supports streaming SSE + non-streaming. Strips `<think>` tags by default; `?include_thinking=true` passes them through.

### Persona Types (legacy — kept for migration)
The `/personas` route still exists for one release with a "Personas have moved" banner pointing to `/agents`. The 10 legacy persona types (Nexus Agent, Web Researcher, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MSSQL, Snowflake, MongoDB, MCP Server, API Connector, File Operations) live as seed data in `app.py` and continue to feed the create-from-/personas wizard, but new work should add agents through the Agents-by-Kind picker instead. Social platforms are NOT persona types — they belong in Distributions.

### Sidebar / Routes
Solo sidebar (8 daily-use items, `components/navigation/desktop-sidebar.tsx`):
**Chat · Knowledge · Automations · Crews · Approvals · Distributions · Models · Settings**

Coder sidebar (5 items, `components/navigation/desktop-sidebar-coder.tsx`):
**Projects · Running · Templates · Models · Settings**

Routes still mounted in `App.tsx` but not in the daily-nav sidebar: `/agents`, `/blueprints`, `/personas` (banner), `/workspace`, `/analytics`. These are reached via direct URL, via the tabbed library picker inside the Crew builder, or via the Agents-by-Kind picker.

### Key Configuration
- `backend/settings.py` — Centralized env-var config with defaults (port 18741)
- `frontend/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` — Tauri app config, sidecar path, window settings
- `frontend/vite.config.ts` — Path alias `@/` → `./src/`, dev port 1420

### Port Convention
Backend sidecar runs on **port 18741** (not 8000). This avoids conflicts with Docker stacks, common dev tools, and other desktop apps. All references are aligned: `sidecar.rs`, `transport.ts`, `settings.py`.

### camelCase / snake_case Mismatch
Backend API returns camelCase (`messageType`, `messageId`, `sessionId`) but frontend types use snake_case (`message_type`, `message_id`, `session_id`). The `normalizeMessage()` function in `lib/api/chat-client.ts` bridges this gap when loading messages from the API.

## Code Conventions

- **Branching**: NEVER commit directly to `main`. `main` is branch-protected — direct commits will be rejected/reverted. Always create a topic branch first (`feat/<x>`, `fix/<x>`, `docs/<x>`, `chore/<x>`) and open a PR. Applies to docs-only changes too. Releases go through the `/prod-release` and `/release` skills, which handle branch hygiene correctly.
- **Commits**: Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:`)
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode, no untyped `any`. Functional components with hooks. `@/*` import alias. `cn()` utility for conditional Tailwind classes.
- **Python**: Type hints on all signatures. Pydantic v2 for models. All I/O must be async. PEP 8 naming.
- **Tailwind**: Dark mode via `class` strategy. Custom color tokens: `primary` (orange), `secondary` (sky blue), `dark` (zinc).

## Testing
- **E2E (Playwright)**: Tests in `frontend/tests/e2e/`. Chromium only, single worker. Global setup seeds localStorage with wizard completion flag. Requires both frontend dev server and backend running.
- **Backend (pytest)**: Standard pytest in `backend/tests/`.
