# aipack

aipack is a package manager for AI agent knowledge. Packs contain rules, skills, workflows, agents, prompts, MCP configs, and settings. A sync engine renders pack content to any supported harness (Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex, Cline) via profiles. Go 1.25+ module.

## Commands

```bash
make build          # Build for current platform → dist/
make test           # Run all Go tests
make lint           # go vet + staticcheck + go fix (applies fixes in-place)
make fmt            # go fmt ./...
make fmt-check      # Fail if source is unformatted
make install        # Build + copy to ~/.local/bin
make dist           # Cross-compile all platforms (darwin, linux, windows)

# Single test
go test ./internal/app/ -run TestSyncAndApply -v

# Single package
go test ./internal/engine/...
```

`VERSION` is the source of truth for the release line. Injected via ldflags at build (`-X main.version`, `-X main.commit`). Full release process in `RELEASING.md`.

## Architecture

Three layers enforced by `cmd/aipack/architecture_test.go`:

| Layer | Path | Role |
|-------|------|------|
| CLI | `cmd/aipack/` | Kong adapters — parse flags, delegate to app |
| Service | `internal/app/` | Request → Run → Result. No CLI deps, no I/O globals |
| Domain | `internal/` (config, domain, engine, harness, render) | Business logic, no upward imports |

Import rules (test-enforced, violations fail `go test`):
- `internal/` NEVER imports `cmd/`
- `harness/` and `render/` NEVER import `config/` (depend on domain + engine only)
- No imports of deleted v1 packages (full blocklist in `architecture_test.go`)

## Key abstractions

Services in `internal/app/` follow a Request → Run → Result pattern with injected I/O — no global state. See the existing services for the shape.

Sync produces a **Plan** by accumulating **Fragments** from each harness adapter. Settings and MCP are separate plan vectors with different gating behavior — details in `internal/harness/AGENTS.md`.

Four harness adapters (`claudecode`, `opencode`, `codex`, `cline`) handle both forward sync (Plan) and reverse save (Capture). Scope branching is per-harness. Interface contract and patterns: `internal/harness/AGENTS.md`.

## Content model

A pack contains these content vectors, all auto-discovered from standard directories when not explicitly listed in the manifest:

| Vector | Directory | Discovery | Extension |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Rules | `rules/` | `*.md` | `.md` |
| Agents | `agents/` | `*.md` | `.md` |
| Workflows | `workflows/` | `*.md` | `.md` |
| Skills | `skills/` | `*/SKILL.md` | dir-based |
| Prompts | `prompts/` | `*.md` | `.md` |
| Profiles | `profiles/` | `*.yaml` | `.yaml` |
| Registries | `registries/` | `*.yaml` | `.yaml` |
| MCP | `mcp/` | `*.json` (via manifest) | `.json` |
| Configs | `configs/` | per-harness subdirs (via manifest) | varies |
| Extras | — | via manifest `extras` field | arbitrary |

Manifest fields for all vectors are **ID-based** (e.g., `"rules": ["anti-slop"]`, `"profiles": ["dev"]`). Extras are the exception — they use relative paths because they can reference files outside standard directories.

### Bundled content and `--with`

Core content (rules, skills, workflows, agents, prompts, MCP, configs) is always installed. Profiles, registries, and extras are **bundled content** — gated by `--with` (`-w`). Remote installs without `--with` preview bundled content then strip it from the installed pack. `WithSet` in code tracks which categories are approved; `applyWithFilter` in `pack_extract.go` removes unapproved files and updates the manifest.

### Content extraction

Remote installs (clone and HTTP tarball) produce clean content-only packs. `extractPackContent` in `pack_extract.go` copies only standard content directories and declared extras from the clone into a staging directory, then atomically moves it into the packs directory. The clone is discarded.

### Multi-pack settings

Any pack with harness config files (`configs/` directory) contributes base settings automatically. Multiple packs' settings are deep-merged in profile order (first pack wins at leaf conflicts). Set `settings.enabled: false` on a pack entry to opt out.

### Pack root references

MCP server definitions can use `{pack:root}` to reference extras — scripts, data files, binaries — bundled with the pack. Resolved at sync time to the installed pack's absolute path. Expansion order: `{pack:root}` → `{params.*}` → `{env:*}`.

## Conventions

- Wrap errors with `%w` — always preserve context
- Exit codes: `cmdutil.ExitOK` (0), `ExitFail` (1), `ExitUsage` (2)
- Tests: `t.Parallel()` where safe, `t.TempDir()` for isolation, NEVER `t.Parallel()` with `t.Setenv()` or `t.Chdir()`
- Use `make fmt` (not raw `gofmt -w`) for formatting
- `--skip-settings` skips settings only; MCP configs and plugins always sync
- Version injected via ldflags at build time (`-X main.version`, `-X main.commit`)
- All commits require `Signed-off-by` — use `git commit --signoff`
- Default scope is `global` — examples and help text should reflect this

## Key packages

| Package | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `cmd/aipack/` | CLI adapters (Kong), TUI (Bubbletea) — see `cmd/aipack/AGENTS.md` |
| `internal/app/` | Service orchestration: sync, save, clean, doctor, pack lifecycle, trace, inspect |
| `internal/config/` | Config parsing: profiles, manifests, sync-config, pack discovery, JSON schema validation |
| `internal/domain/` | Core types: `Plan`, `Fragment`, `Profile`, `Ledger`, content types, enums (`Harness`, `Scope`, `PackCategory`) |
| `internal/engine/` | Sync pipeline: parse, resolve, plan, diff, apply, merge, settings composition, env expansion |
| `internal/harness/` | Four adapters (`claudecode`, `opencode`, `codex`, `cline`) + promotion/capture — see `internal/harness/AGENTS.md` |
| `internal/index/` | SQLite FTS5 search index over pack content |
| `internal/render/` | Portable pack rendering (harness-independent) |
| `internal/source/` | URL probing and fetch: GitHub, Bitbucket, OCI DevOps, git clone, HTTP tarball |
| `internal/cmdutil/` | CLI utilities: exit codes, scope/harness resolution, flag helpers |
| `internal/util/` | Filesystem ops, digests, symlink-safe copy, atomic writes |
| `schemas/` | Embedded JSON Schemas (pack.json, MCP server) |
| `docs/` | User documentation — `docs/aipack.md` is authoritative for sync behavior |
| `tools/task/` | Cross-platform Go task runner (replaces shell Makefile recipes) |

## Testing

Integration tests in `internal/app/integration_test.go` use a `contractEnv` helper that creates isolated temp dirs for project, home, and pack root, then runs full sync cycles against real harness adapters. These test behavioral contracts (idempotency, subtraction, convergence, cross-harness isolation) across all four harnesses.

Unit tests in each package follow standard Go conventions. `internal/app/` tests use `fakeCloneGitFn` and similar injection points to avoid network calls.

## Workflow

- Before editing: read nearby code and related tests
- After editing: `go test ./...`, then `make lint`
- Before declaring done: `make build && make test && make lint` must all pass
- `make lint` runs `go vet`, `staticcheck` (if installed), and `go fix ./...` (applies Go modernization fixes in-place).
- Pre-commit: `go build ./... && go test ./... && make fmt` → check `git diff` for fmt changes → stage any → commit
- Feature work going to main: single atomic commit, not per-task intermediaries
- Commits use `git commit --signoff`
### What to update when

| You changed... | Also update |
|---------------|-------------|
| CLI flags or behavior | Help text in the same file |
| Sync behavior or per-harness rendering | `docs/aipack.md` (authoritative reference) |
| JSON output shape | `docs/cli-spec.md` (output contracts) |
| Pack format or profile schema | `docs/pack-format.md` |
| Any user-visible feature, fix, or breaking change | `CHANGELOG.md` Unreleased section |
| Config directory layout or sync-config schema | `docs/configuration.md` |
| Collision strategy or profile resolution behavior | `docs/configuration.md` + `docs/profiles.md` |
| Manifest fields or content discovery | `internal/config/pack_discover.go` + `docs/pack-format.md` |
| User-facing CLI vocabulary (flag renames, new `pack` subcommands, lockfile/sync-config layout) | `shrug-labs/packs` → `aipack-core/skills/aipack-system/SKILL.md` tables |

### Release process

`VERSION` is the source of truth. Full process in `RELEASING.md`: bump VERSION → update CHANGELOG → verify (`make fmt-check && make test && go vet ./... && make dist`) → commit → tag `vX.Y.Z` → push tag. The tag triggers CI to build and publish release assets.

Run release `make` targets (`dist`, `release-tag-check`) from the repo root — they silently produce wrong output from any other directory.

**Before tagging, scan the `aipack-core` pack content for stale CLI references.** The `aipack-core` pack (in the `shrug-labs/packs` repo) documents aipack's CLI surface in `skills/aipack-system/SKILL.md` — command tables, flag syntax, lockfile/sync-config routing, version pinning forms. Any release that renames a flag, adds a subcommand, or changes user-facing config layout needs a matching edit there. Recurring miss: each aipack minor release has drifted the pack content at least once (v0.21 lockfile table, v0.22 `--ref`/`--version` table). Fast scan:

```bash
# From ~/src/gh/shrug-labs/packs (or wherever the packs repo is cloned):
grep -rn "installed_packs\|sync-config\|pack install\|pack update\|aipack\.lock\|--version\|--ref\|pack versions" aipack-core/ | grep -v "test\|fixture"
```

Verify each hit against the new binary by running `go run ./cmd/aipack <cmd> --help` from this repo — use the source-tree binary so you see current behavior, not whatever `~/.local/bin/aipack` has cached.
