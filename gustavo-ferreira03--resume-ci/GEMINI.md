# AGENTS.md

Instructions for agents creating or editing resumes in this repository.

## Project Context

- Resume content lives in `resumes/*.yml`, one file per resume.
- The example resumes (`resumes/*.example.yml`) are the canonical reference for valid shape.
- The schema that validates resumes lives in `lib/src/schema.ts`; `lib/schema.json` is generated from it for editor autocomplete.
- Templates are single Typst files: `templates/<name>.typ`. Pick one with `meta.template`.

Your job in this repo is resume **content**: strong, honest, well-structured bullets that survive a recruiter and a hiring manager. The build tooling is documented in `README.md`.

## YAML Rules

- Use the JSON Resume-compatible shape from `resumes/*.example.yml`.
- Keep top-level content keys aligned with JSON Resume: `basics`, `work`, `volunteer`, `education`, `awards`, `certificates`, `publications`, `skills`, `languages`, `interests`, `references`, `projects`.
- Put build and presentation settings under `meta`.
- Use `meta.template` for the template name without `.typ`; default is `default`.
- Use a real Typst font name in `meta.font`; default examples use `New Computer Modern`.
- Use only letters, digits, `_`, and `-` in `meta.output_filename`.
- Use `meta.sections` to control section order and titles: key order sets render order, a blank value (`work:`) keeps the default title, and unlisted sections render last in the built-in order. Keys must be JSON Resume section names.
- Set `meta.locale` to the BCP 47 locale of the resume language (`en`, `pt-BR`, `es`, etc.). This controls date formatting (`2024-09` → `Sep 2024` in EN, `Set 2024` in PT-BR) and the default present-role label (`Present`, `Atual`, `Actualidad`). Always set it for non-English resumes.
- Use `meta.present_label` only when the locale's default label is wrong for the context.
- Use JSON Resume date strings: `YYYY`, `YYYY-MM`, or `YYYY-MM-DD`. Omit `endDate` for current roles.
- Use `[]` to hide any list-backed section; keep required keys present unless the schema supplies a default.
- Do not add unsupported fields unless `lib/src/schema.ts` and the relevant template are updated together.
- Preserve Markdown-style emphasis only where useful: `**bold**` and `_italic_`.
- Keep the `# yaml-language-server: $schema=../lib/schema.json` comment in example resumes.

## STAR Method

Every meaningful experience or project bullet must be grounded in STAR:

- Situation: what problem, product, team, system, customer, or constraint existed.
- Task: what the candidate owned or was expected to solve.
- Action: what the candidate personally did, including tools, decisions, and methods.
- Result: what changed after the work.

Final bullets should usually follow this pattern:

```text
Action verb + specific work + context or scope + measurable or observable result.
```

Good:

```yaml
- Refactored payment reconciliation jobs in **Python** and **PostgreSQL**, reducing daily manual review time from 3 hours to 40 minutes.
```

Weak:

```yaml
- Worked on backend improvements and helped the team become more efficient.
```

If the source material does not contain a real result, do not invent one. Ask for the missing evidence or write an honest scope-based bullet.

## Evidence Standards

- Prefer outcomes over responsibilities.
- Prefer concrete scope over generic seniority claims.
- Use metrics when they are real: percentages, time saved, revenue, cost, latency, adoption, volume, team size, tickets, users, requests, or error reduction.
- If exact metrics are unavailable, ask for a defensible approximation.
- If no metric exists, use an observable result without pretending it is quantified.
- Never fabricate employers, dates, titles, tools, projects, metrics, or credentials.

Acceptable non-metric result:

```yaml
- Standardized onboarding documentation for the support team, replacing scattered notes with a single process used for new analyst training.
```

## Anti-AI Writing Rules

Resume prose must sound specific, human, and confirmable.

Avoid:

- Generic summaries such as "results-driven professional" or "proven track record".
- Inflated language such as "visionary", "dynamic", "world-class", or "best-in-class".
- Corporate filler such as "leveraged synergies", "stakeholder ecosystem", or "cross-functional excellence".
- Passive responsibility bullets starting with "Responsible for", "Tasked with", or "Involved in".
- Vague verbs such as "helped", "supported", "handled", or "worked on" unless the contribution was truly secondary.
- AI-style constructions such as "not only X but also Y", "in today's fast-paced environment", "the ability to", and "the ever-evolving world of".

Prefer:

- Direct verbs: built, shipped, led, migrated, automated, reduced, increased, designed, launched, consolidated, analyzed, mentored.
- Plain language that a former manager would recognize.
- Specific nouns: product name, system type, customer segment, process, team, market, repository, service, dashboard, workflow.
- Short bullets with one clear claim each.

## Resume Content Workflow

1. Identify the target role, language, geography, seniority, and resume length.
2. Extract evidence from the user-provided material before rewriting.
3. Ask targeted questions only for missing facts that block strong STAR bullets.
4. Rewrite bullets to show action, scope, and result without exaggeration.
5. Remove AI tells, filler, repeated claims, and unsupported adjectives.
6. Keep the strongest and most relevant evidence near the top.
7. Validate the YAML and run the builder when changing resume files.

## Validate Your Work

After editing a resume, build it and confirm it compiles cleanly:

```bash
make build ARGS="resumes/my-resume.yml"   # one resume
make build                                # all resumes
```

If `make build` reports a missing `lib/bin/typst` or `lib/bin/fonts`, run `make setup` once first. See `README.md` for the full command reference.

## Final Review Checklist

Before finishing a resume edit, verify:

- YAML is valid against `lib/src/schema.ts`.
- `make build` succeeds without warnings or errors.
- Every major bullet can be traced to STAR.
- No metric or claim was invented.
- Bullets start with strong action verbs.
- The language is plain and specific.
- No obvious AI writing patterns remain.
- The target role is clear from `basics.label`, `basics.summary` if present, and top highlights.
- `meta.output_filename` is valid.
