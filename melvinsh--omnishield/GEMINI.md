# AGENTS.md

Guidance for coding agents working in this repository.

OmniShield is a non-root Android ad/tracker blocker: a Kotlin/Compose app over a Rust core that
owns the entire packet path behind `VpnService`.

`README.md` is written for someone installing the app, not for working on it. Technical
documentation lives in `docs/`. Some of what follows is repeated there. When they disagree, the
code wins, and fix both.

| File | What to read it for |
|---|---|
| `docs/architecture.md` | The packet path, the filtering layers, routing, and the platform limitations |
| `docs/development.md` | Toolchain, emulators, offline probes, and the version-constraint table |
| `docs/performance.md` | Measured cost, the mechanisms behind it, and the deliberate choices that look like waste. Check there before "fixing" one of them |
| `docs/interface.md` | Material 3 Expressive, and why each screen is shaped the way it is |

The repo is **public** and MIT licensed. `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `NOTICE.md` and
`CHANGELOG.md` are written for strangers and this file is not, but all of them are readable by
anyone.

## Do not break

- A new dependency in `core/Cargo.toml` must not be GPL. That would conflict with the app's
  licence; `NOTICE.md` explains the check.
- The `## [x.y.z]` headings in `CHANGELOG.md` are parsed by the release workflow. Reshaping
  them silently empties the release notes.
- **`core/Cargo.toml` sets `panic = "abort"`.** A panic cannot usefully unwind across the JNI
  boundary, and the alternative is worse than a crash: unwinding kills only the tunnel thread,
  leaving `VpnService` holding a TUN that nothing services, so every app on the device loses
  connectivity with no error anywhere. Aborting takes the process down and `START_STICKY`
  brings it back. Consequence: no `catch_unwind` anywhere in the core will work.
- cargo-ndk's panic handler dumps the entire process environment to stdout. Do not run it from
  a shell holding live credentials.
- Once `OmniShieldVpnService` calls `ParcelFileDescriptor.detachFd()` and hands the descriptor
  to `nativeStart`, **no packet crosses the JNI boundary**. Preserve this: it is the reason the
  core is in Rust at all.
- `packet::parse` returning `None` means **drop**, never "forward unfiltered": passing a packet
  we failed to parse would be a filtering bypass.

`docs/development.md` has the full version-constraint table. The ones that bite hardest:

- **AGP 9.x is mandatory** (current AndroidX declares `requires Android Gradle plugin 9.1.0 or
  higher`), and AGP 9 has built-in Kotlin, so applying the `kotlin-android` plugin is a hard
  failure.
- **`compileSdk` 37 / `targetSdk` 34** are deliberately different; the platform package is
  `platforms;android-37.0` (the `.0` is required).
- **`minSdk` 29 cannot go lower**: `ConnectivityManager.getConnectionOwnerUid` does not exist
  below it and `/proc/net` scraping was blocked in the same release, so the per-app firewall is
  impossible on anything older.
- material3 is pinned to a **1.5.0-alpha** ahead of the BOM for the Expressive component set;
  the rest of Compose stays stable.

## Couplings that fail silently

None of these produce a compile error when broken. They fail at runtime, usually as "nothing
happens".

1. **JNI symbol mangling.** `core/src/android.rs` exports 14 `Java_io_omnishield_bridge_NativeBridge_*`
   functions matching 14 `external fun`s in `bridge/NativeBridge.kt`. Renaming that object or
   its package requires renaming every Rust export in lockstep. (The package is `bridge`, not
   `native`, which is a Java reserved word.)
2. **Reverse callbacks.** `core/src/jvm.rs` calls Kotlin by name *and JNI signature string*:
   `protect(I)Z`, `lookupUid(ILjava/lang/String;ILjava/lang/String;I)I`, `packageForUid(I)Ljava/lang/String;`
   on `OmniShieldVpnService`. These are `@Keep`-annotated and listed in `proguard-rules.pro`.
3. **The config JSON contract.** `CoreJson.buildConfig` in Kotlin must use the exact serde field
   names in `core/src/config.rs`. A renamed field silently decodes to that field's default.
   `CoreJsonTest` asserts the field names for this reason.
4. **Every off-thread event must wake the tunnel loop.** This one fails as a *hang* rather
   than as nothing happening. The loop sleeps until there is something to do (backstop
   `IDLE_CEILING_MS`, 30 s) instead of waking on a timer, so anything that changes state from
   another thread must call `Runtime::wake`: the JNI config and rule setters, `Runtime::stop`,
   and the DoH worker, whose answers arrive on an mpsc channel the loop only drains while
   awake. `core/src/wake.rs` documents all three. A new producer that forgets to wake looks
   like a hung tunnel, and the 30 s ceiling is the only reason it self-heals instead of
   staying wedged.

## Packet path

Kotlin owns lifecycle, persistence and UI. Rust owns everything on the packet path.

Events flow back by *polling* (`nativeDrainEvents` in `pollCore()`), not by native-to-JVM
callbacks, which would require attaching the tunnel thread to the JVM per event. The poll
interval is **adaptive**, not fixed, and its rules differ by screen state (`PollSchedule`):
while someone is watching (`TunnelRepository.uiActive` *and* the screen interactive), any event
snaps the interval to the 500 ms floor and the ceiling is 2 s. Screen off, cadence follows
drain *volume*, not activity — small batches let it double toward 30 s, moderate ones hold,
large ones halve — because every allowed DNS query is an event, so "any event resets the
floor" would keep the loop at 2 Hz all night. Either way a drain returning ≥75% of the core's
2000-entry ring polls below the floor, so a busy device cannot overflow the ring and lose log
rows. The stats JNI call, the notification republish and the StateFlow writes are all skipped
when nothing happened and nobody is looking; a screen-on receiver refreshes the notification
on wake.

### Tunnel loop (`core/src/runtime.rs`, ~1400 lines)

One thread drives a single `poll()` over the TUN descriptor plus every upstream socket. The hard
problem it solves: smoltcp sockets bind to a *specific* endpoint, but a transparent tunnel must
accept arbitrary destinations. Two mechanisms combine:

- `Interface::set_any_ip(true)`, to accept packets not addressed to us.
- Every packet is peeked before smoltcp sees it; on a SYN to a new 4-tuple a socket is created
  already listening on that exact destination, *then* the frame is handed over.

The connection structs and the retirement rules (`kill_upstream`, `reap`) live in
`core/src/relay.rs`, *outside* the android-gated modules, so they compile and are unit-tested
on the host — `cargo test` never type-checks `runtime.rs` itself, only `cargo ndk … check`
does. Two rules there are load-bearing: an upstream read/write error must close the fd and
withdraw it from the poll set (`POLLERR`/`POLLHUP` are reported even when not requested, so a
dead fd left in the set spins the loop at 100% of a core — UDP sessions included, because
outgoing traffic refreshes their idle TTL), and a connection whose remaining bytes can never
be delivered must be reaped rather than held for their sake.

### The tunnel does not claim the LAN

`TunnelRoutes` computes the complement of the private ranges rather than routing `0.0.0.0/0`,
and reverting that breaks the LAN. With a default route, an **inbound** LAN connection is dead on
arrival: the SYN reaches the device on the physical interface, but the reply is routed by
destination into the TUN, and the core only creates a socket on a peeked *SYN*, and a SYN-ACK for
an unknown 4-tuple is dropped. Anything that listens (file transfer, media server, `adb
connect`) silently failed while the tunnel was up.

Two things not to break when touching it:

- **`10.0.0.0/24` is re-added explicitly.** It sits inside the excluded `10/8` and carries the
  DNS sentinel every app is handed. Drop it and name resolution stops device-wide.
- **`Builder.excludeRoute` is API 33 and `minSdk` is 29**, which is why the complement is
  computed. For the same reason `BigInteger.TWO` is unusable here: it is API 33, the unit tests
  run on a desktop JVM where it exists, and only lint catches it.

## Filtering

| Layer | Module | Sees |
|---|---|---|
| 1, DNS sinkholing | `dns.rs` + `filter.rs` + `dns_cache.rs` | All traffic |
| 2, TLS termination | `ca.rs` + `mitm.rs` | Opt-in per UID only |
| 3, ABP rules + cosmetic | `content.rs` | Decrypted traffic only |

Layer 2 is opt-in and bypassed by default, because since Android 7 apps ignore user-installed
CAs unless they opt in, so it reaches Chrome-family browsers and little else. An app that rejects
our certificate is recorded and permanently bypassed rather than left broken.

Filters are **built once and cached**. `nativeLoadFilters` only *stages* text;
`nativeCommitFilters` builds the index and writes `filters.bin` + `content.bin` (the serialized
`adblock` engine) under `cache_dir`, keyed by a string Kotlin derives from the name/size/mtime
of every list file. `nativeLoadCachedFilters` restores both and returns -1 on a miss. A warm
start therefore never opens the ~13 MB of lists at all. Any doubt, whether missing, truncated,
wrongly keyed or the wrong version, falls back to parsing; see `core/src/cache.rs`.

`filter.rs` stores the ~430k list domains as one UTF-8 blob plus a sorted offset index (binary
search), not `HashSet<String>`. Its existing tests are the contract for any change here,
particularly `does_not_block_sibling_suffix` and `www_rule_does_not_widen_to_apex`. User
overrides are checked *before* the lists at each suffix level, so an explicit choice beats a
downloaded rule at the same specificity.

DNS list formats and ABP browser syntax are **not interchangeable**. `FilterRepository` keeps
`DNS_SOURCES` and `CONTENT_SOURCES` separate; feeding EasyList to the DNS filter produces junk.

## Kotlin and UI

`OmniShieldVpnService` → `TunnelRepository` (process-level observable state) and
`LogRepository` (durable Room history + daily rollups). Screens read ViewModels only; they never
touch `NativeBridge` or construct repositories inline. The log screen reads Room, not a
mirrored field on a repository: such a field would be rewritten several times a second and read
only while that one screen is open.

`LogRepository` batches on purpose: inserts go in per drain inside one transaction, retention
pruning runs on a five-minute timer, and daily counter deltas accumulate in memory and flush
every 30 s (and on tunnel stop, via `flushPending`. Skip that call and the last few minutes of
a session are lost).

`TunnelStatus` is a sealed type including `Failed(reason)`. A tunnel that could not start must
render its reason, not fall back to looking like "not connected".

Room has **no destructive migration fallback**. Schema changes need a real migration; schemas
are exported to `app/schemas/`.

Five tabs, one file each in `ui/`, all wrapped in `ui/components/ScreenScaffold`, which
supplies the title bar (title + one-line statement of what the screen is for) and the
`SnackbarHost` reachable through `LocalSnackbar`. A screen without it renders with no title and
throws on the first snackbar, both deliberate: every screen must say what it is, and every
action must be acknowledged.

`MainActivity`'s `Scaffold` owns the navigation bar and zeroes its own `contentWindowInsets`,
because each `TopAppBar` applies the status-bar inset itself. Padding both double-pads.

Three things in here are not free choices:

- **`ruleSummary` (firewall) and `overrideTarget` (log) carry the real UI logic**, and both have
  unit tests. The firewall's switches *block*, which is the opposite of the usual
  reading, so the row states its rule in words and the switch is a second representation of it.
  `overrideTarget` decides whether a log row even has a domain to override: a `tcp` row is
  labelled `address:port` and an `http` row with a full URL, and a user rule keyed on either
  literal string is stored, listed in Settings, and matches nothing.
- **The firewall list is alphabetical and never reorders itself.** A `LazyColumn` holds its
  scroll offset while items are inserted above it, so hoisting blocked apps to the top slides the
  row the user just touched out of the viewport. Finding blocked apps is a filter chip instead.
- **New filter lists are not pushed into a running core.** `FilterRefreshWorker` explains why;
  the manual "Refresh now" in Settings therefore says the lists load on the next connect rather
  than implying an effect it does not have.

## Environment

Nothing is on the default PATH. Every command below assumes:

```bash
export JAVA_HOME=/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@17          # keg-only
export ANDROID_HOME=/opt/homebrew/share/android-commandlinetools
export PATH="$JAVA_HOME/bin:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools:/opt/homebrew/opt/rustup/bin:$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"
```

rustup's shims live in `/opt/homebrew/opt/rustup/bin`, **not** `~/.cargo/bin` (which holds only
cargo-installed binaries like `cargo-ndk`). Gradle resolves `cargo` itself via `rustToolDirs` in
`app/build.gradle.kts`, so builds work without these exports; the Rust commands do not.

Git: `master` on `github.com/melvinsh/omnishield`. Build outputs, `core/target/`,
`app/src/main/jniLibs/` and the ~13 MB of downloaded blocklists are gitignored; the lists are
pulled off a device on demand (see [Offline probes](#offline-probes)), while `core/probe-*.txt`
are checked-in fixtures and should stay that way.

## Build

```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug        # cargoNdkBuild runs automatically via preBuild
./gradlew installDebug
```

Building the Rust core alone **must run from `core/`**, because cargo-ndk invokes
`cargo metadata` in the working directory and `--manifest-path` alone is not enough. Note `-P`
(capital) is the API level; lowercase `-p` means `--package` in cargo-ndk 4.x and fails with
`unknown package: 29`:

```bash
cd core && cargo ndk -t arm64-v8a -t x86_64 -P 29 -o ../app/src/main/jniLibs build --release
```

## Test

All three suites must pass:

```bash
cd core && cargo test                      # 108 host-native tests, no emulator
./gradlew testDebugUnitTest                # 58 Kotlin unit tests (Robolectric)
./gradlew connectedDebugAndroidTest        # 36 Room + Compose UI tests, needs an emulator
```

Single tests:

```bash
cd core && cargo test filter::tests::www_rule_does_not_widen_to_apex
./gradlew testDebugUnitTest --tests "io.omnishield.data.CoreJsonTest"
./gradlew connectedDebugAndroidTest \
  -Pandroid.testInstrumentationRunnerArguments.class=io.omnishield.data.db.DatabaseTest
```

## Offline probes

Two offline probes exist for reasoning about filter behaviour without a device. Use these
instead of guessing whether a miss is a rule gap or a code bug:

```bash
cd core
cargo run --release --example dnstest  -- probe-hosts.txt <list.txt> [more.txt ...]
cargo run --release --example ruletest -- easylist.txt easyprivacy.txt
```

**`dnstest`'s first argument is the list of hostnames to *test*, not a blocklist**: one bare
hostname per line. Passing a blocklist there reports `blocked 0/N` and looks exactly like a
catastrophic filtering regression. Everything after it is a blocklist. Run it twice: once with
hostnames that must be blocked and once with legitimate ones that must not, because
over-blocking is the failure mode a single probe will not show you.

The lists themselves are not in the repo. Pull the real ones off a device that has run once:

```bash
adb shell "run-as io.omnishield cat files/filters/stevenblack-hosts.txt" > stevenblack-hosts.txt
unzip -p app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk assets/filters/default.txt > bundled.txt
```

Use `--release`: a debug build parses 13 MB of lists slowly enough to look hung.

## Emulators

`omnishield-34` is the default target; `omnishield-33` exists because Android 14 made the system
trust store immutable, so CA-injection testing only works on 33.

```bash
$ANDROID_HOME/emulator/emulator -avd omnishield-34 -no-snapshot -no-boot-anim
adb shell appops set io.omnishield ACTIVATE_VPN allow   # skip the consent dialog when scripting
```

## Measuring cost

CPU time is the battery proxy, since battery itself is not measurable on QEMU. Compare
`/proc/<pid>/stat` utime+stime deltas over a fixed window, with the screen both on and off,
plus `dumpsys meminfo io.omnishield` at startup *and* 60 s later; the startup peak and the
steady state are different numbers, and the peak is the one the filter cache addresses.
