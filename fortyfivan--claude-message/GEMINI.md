## About Claude Message

Claude Message is a dynamic messaging system for Claude Code. It provides the harness that helps product marketers build, maintain, and operationalize their positioning and messaging across the entire GTM lifecycle. The messaging house in `messaging/` is the single source of truth — agents read it for context, write to it with user approval, and generate content from it. Users run `/bootstrap` to build the messaging system from scratch.

## Writing Profile

Generate consistent, clear, and compelling messaging grounded in the company's market position, audience, and differentiation.

<!-- claude-message:profile:start -->
Run `/bootstrap` to generate your writing profile from the messaging house.
<!-- claude-message:profile:end -->

When a writing profile exists between the markers above, use it as the primary context for all messaging work. The profile specifies the company identity, stage, and market — use these to calibrate tone, proof expectations, and positioning decisions.

Read the messaging house before responding to any messaging or content request. Output must be grounded in what the company actually claims, who it actually serves, and how it actually differentiates. Never fabricate positioning, claims, or evidence.

## Messaging House

Six pillars build on each other: Profile (who we are) → Space (where we compete) → Audience (who we sell to) → Portfolio (what we sell) → Proof (evidence it works) → Motion (how we go to market). A glossary defines company-specific terminology. Collection subdirectories hold detailed profiles that support each pillar.

### File Conventions

- YAML frontmatter for metadata, markdown body for narrative. Three-section structure: `## Messaging Blocks` (content), `## Writing Guidelines` (interpretation rules), `## Messaging Rules` (constraints).
- Kebab-case filenames. Follow schemas in `templates/messaging/` when creating new docs.
- **Frontmatter contract:** Frontmatter carries identity, freshness, progressive-loading filters, and cross-references — nothing else. Pillar docs use only `title` and `updated` (plus `stage`/`type`/`market` on profile.md). Collection profiles add `description`, filter fields (`type`, `tier`, `status`, `seniority`, `priority`), and relationship arrays (`products`, `personas`, `segments`, `related_categories`, `parent`). All other fields belong in the markdown body.
- Pillar docs contain reference tables with a **Description** column (~15 words) for routing. Collection profiles have a matching `description` in frontmatter — keep them in sync.
- All docs include an `updated` field (ISO date) tracking last substantive edit.
- Follow bracketed template guidance (`[Instructions:]`, `[Tips:]`, `[Format:]`) during drafting — don't copy brackets into generated files.
- **Messaging Blocks carry three content types, distinguished by format:**
  - **Prose / numbered lists** → pure messaging (claims, value statements, narrative — draw from this)
  - **Key-value pairs / field lists** → routing context (signals for how/where to apply messaging — use to select and calibrate)
  - **Paired structures** (objection/reframe, win/loss) → operational detail (deploy in specific scenarios)
  All three belong in Messaging Blocks. The litmus test: if an agent would **draw from** the content, it's a Messaging Block; if an agent would **follow** the content as an instruction, it's a Writing Guideline.
- Ask for confirmation before writing changes to existing messaging docs.

## Project Layout

| Directory | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `messaging/` | The messaging house — pillars, profiles, glossary, brand tokens |
| `templates/` | Doc schemas, content contracts, asset templates (read-only) |
| `.claude/agents/` | Subagent definitions (writer, researcher, reader, producer) |
| `.claude/skills/` | Workflow, task, craft, and system skills |
| `.claude/commands/` | Slash command entrypoints |
| `input/` | User-provided source materials organized by type (see below) |
| `insights/` | Insight tracker, config, and findings |
| `artifacts/` | Living artifacts — versioned, maintained assets with manifests and changelogs |
| `output/` | Generated content and finished deliverables |

### Input Directory

The `input/` directory has five subdirectories scanned in priority order:

| Subdirectory | Content | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| `input/messaging/` | Brand guides, positioning decks, messaging frameworks | Highest |
| `input/docs/` | PRDs, release notes, specs, pricing sheets | High |
| `input/research/` | Market research, analyst reports, competitive intel | Medium |
| `input/transcripts/` | Sales calls, customer interviews, feedback logs | Medium |
| `input/examples/` | Content references, competitor samples | Lowest |

Files in the `input/` root still work for backward compatibility. Use a workflow tag suffix (`--launch-[name]` or `--campaign-[slug]`) to associate files with specific workflows. See `input/README.md` for the full naming and tagging guide.

**Note:** `input/research/` (user-provided) is distinct from `output/research/` (agent-generated).

## Artifacts

Living artifacts are versioned, continuously maintained assets (decks, collateral, roadmaps) that must stay current with the messaging house. Each artifact lives in `artifacts/[slug]/` with three files: `manifest.md` (dependencies, structure, triggers), `current.[ext]` (the canonical version), and `changelog.md` (version history). Versioned archives (`v1.0.0.[ext]`, etc.) accumulate as the artifact is updated.

Initial production uses the campaign or writer workflows. Run `/update [slug]` to detect drift, review proposed changes, and version the result. Run `/update` with no arguments to see all artifacts and their drift status.

## Rules

1. **Ground in the messaging house.** All messaging traces back to foundational docs. Do not fabricate positioning or claims.
2. **Protect the source of truth.** Never write to `messaging/` without user approval. Never modify `templates/`.
3. **Load the skill before generating.** Read the relevant `SKILL.md` from `.claude/skills/` for output format, quality signals, and guidelines.
4. **Read before writing.** Check related messaging docs before drafting to maintain consistency. Adapt language depth to the target persona's altitude.
5. **Skills work without tuning.** `/tune` personalizes skills in place with company-specific calibration. Git preserves originals — use `git checkout .claude/skills/` to reset.

## Agents

Four subagents handle execution. Each carries its own detailed instructions in `.claude/agents/`.

- **writer** — Context-resolution engine that determines which messaging docs to load, generates content grounded in them, and dispatches the reader for review.
- **researcher** — Searches external sources and evaluates findings against the messaging system. Works standalone or as a sub-agent of the investigate workflow.
- **reader** — Formal evaluation gate for generated content. Scores against clarity, consistency, relevance, differentiation, actionability, and authenticity.
- **producer** — Creates finished deliverables (PDF, slides, HTML) from approved content using brand tokens and asset templates. Never modifies content.

## Working with Users

When users ask you to work on messaging content:

1. Read relevant messaging house components for context before drafting.
2. If the task involves content generation, load the appropriate skill.
3. Present your findings or proposed approach before making changes.
4. Ask clarifying questions when scope, audience, or intent is ambiguous.
5. After making changes, summarize what was modified and why.

Keep questions focused — no more than 5 at a time. Show context before asking.
