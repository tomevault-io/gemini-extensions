# Asylum

Agent-agnostic Docker sandbox for AI coding agents (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Codex). Single Go binary, cross-compiled for ARM and x86.

## Change Management

This project uses [OpenSpec](https://openspec.dev) for structured change management. Use the `/opsx:propose` skill to start a new change, `/opsx:apply` to implement, and `/opsx:archive` to archive completed changes. See `openspec/` for specs and change history.

## Architecture

- **Go** (latest stable) — single binary, no runtime dependencies beyond Docker
- Cross-compiled for `linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`, `darwin/amd64`, `darwin/arm64`
- Shells out to Docker CLI via `os/exec` and `syscall.Exec` (process replacement)
- Layered YAML config: `~/.asylum/config.yaml` → `$project/.asylum` → `$project/.asylum.local` → CLI flags
- Embedded assets (Dockerfile.core/tail, entrypoint.core/tail) via `go:embed`
- Manual CLI argument parsing with passthrough semantics (unknown flags forwarded to agents)
- Kit system: modular, composable tooling profiles (languages, tools, services) that inject Dockerfile/entrypoint/config/rules snippets
- TUI wizard (bubbletea) for first-run setup and kit selection

### Key Behaviors

- **First-run wizard** (`firstrun/`) guides kit selection and agent config seeding on first use. Agent config is seeded from host (`~/.claude` → `~/.asylum/agents/claude/`), but resume is skipped for that first session since seeded data doesn't represent a container session.
- **Two-tier images**: a base image (shared across projects, kit-driven) and per-project images (project-specific packages, kits). Base image rebuild invalidates all project images (`baseRebuilt` flag cascades to `EnsureProject`).
- **Kit-driven image assembly**: Dockerfile and entrypoint are assembled from core templates + kit snippets + tail. Each kit registers Dockerfile, entrypoint, config, and rules snippets. Kits have tiers (global vs project-level).
- **Config migration**: v1→v2 migration (`config/migrate.go`) handles schema evolution. New kits are detected and offered via `config/kitsync.go`.
- **Port allocation**: `ports/` maintains a file-locked registry so each project gets non-overlapping host port ranges.
- **Self-update**: checks GitHub releases for updates (stable and dev channels).
- **Onboarding**: in-container tasks (e.g. `npm install`) run post-start with hash-based change detection to avoid redundant work.
- Container names are deterministic: `asylum-<sha256(project_dir)[:12]>`.
- Project directory is mounted at its real host path (not `/workspace`), preserving absolute paths.
- **The entrypoint script must never install anything.** It configures the environment (PATH, mise, fnm, git, direnv) but all tool/package installation belongs in the Dockerfile (base or project image). Installing in the entrypoint adds latency to every container start and is not cached.

## Code Style

### General

- **Less code is better.** Every line must earn its place. Avoid defensive boilerplate, speculative abstractions, and "just in case" code paths.
- Use modern Go: generics where they reduce duplication, errors as values, `slices`/`maps` packages.
- No unnecessary interfaces — don't create an interface until there are two implementations. A concrete type is fine.
- Keep functions short: one concern per function, early returns for error cases.
- Use `if err != nil { return err }` — don't wrap errors unless the wrapper adds information the caller doesn't already have.
- **Do not add fields, config options, or functionality without consulting the user.** If something seems needed but isn't explicitly requested, ask first.

### Comments

Code comments are used sparingly. Comprehensible and expressive code (consistent, logical naming) is preferred.

Comments are added when they contribute to much faster, better understanding in two cases:
- To explain **why** something was done, when it is not apparent from the context.
- To explain **what** is being done, if the code is necessarily difficult to understand.

If a log line explains what is happening, any comment above that line which essentially says the same thing is redundant and should not be added.

### Naming

- Package names: short, lowercase, no underscores. Avoid stutter (`config.Config` is fine, `config.ConfigConfig` is not).
- Functions/methods: verb-noun (`buildImage`, `loadConfig`). Getters drop the `Get` prefix (`Name()`, not `GetName()`).
- Variables: short-lived vars can be short (`f`, `err`, `cmd`). Longer-lived vars get descriptive names.
- Constants: `CamelCase`, not `SCREAMING_SNAKE`.

### Error Handling

- Return `error` from functions that can fail. Don't panic except for programmer errors.
- Wrap errors with `fmt.Errorf("context: %w", err)` only when the wrapper adds value.
- Log errors at the point of handling, not at the point of returning.
- Use the project's `log` package for user-facing output, not `fmt.Println` or the standard `log` package.

### Testing

- Use Go's built-in `testing` package. No test frameworks.
- Table-driven tests for functions with multiple input/output cases.
- Test files live next to the code they test (`config_test.go` next to `config.go`).
- Test the important logic: config merging, volume shorthand parsing, session detection, command generation, hash computation. Don't test trivial getters.
- Use `testdata/` directories for fixture files.
- **Integration tests** (`integration/`) require Docker and are slow (each `docker run` against the 5.6GB image takes seconds). They are gated behind `-tags integration` and excluded from `go test ./...`. Only run them via `make test-integration` as a final check before merging — do not run them during iterative development.
- **E2E tests** (`e2e/`) test full asylum workflows end-to-end with Docker. Also gated behind build tags.

## Dependencies

- `gopkg.in/yaml.v3` — config file parsing
- `github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea` + `lipgloss` — TUI wizard and interactive prompts

CLI parsing is manual (to support passthrough semantics). Avoid adding dependencies unless they save significant effort.

## Changelog

`CHANGELOG.md` tracks all user-facing changes. When making significant changes (new features, bug fixes, breaking changes), add an entry under the **Unreleased** section at the top. Use the existing categories: **Added**, **Changed**, **Fixed**, **Removed**. Keep entries concise — one line per change. Do not create categories that have no entries.

To release, use the `/release` command (e.g., `/release 0.3.0`). It moves unreleased entries into a versioned section, commits, and tags.

## CI/CD

- **CI** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): Runs `go test` and `go vet` on every push/PR to main, then builds all four targets.
- **Release** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`): Triggered by version tags (`v*`). Builds binaries with version baked in and publishes them as GitHub release assets.
- **Dev Release** (`.github/workflows/dev-release.yml`): Builds and publishes a rolling `dev` pre-release on every push to `main`.
- **Docs** (`.github/workflows/docs.yml`): Publishes documentation on push to main.
- **Install script** (`install.sh`): Detects OS/arch and downloads the correct binary from the latest GitHub release.

## What NOT to Do

- Do not add Docker SDK. Shell out to the `docker` CLI — it's simpler and avoids a huge dependency tree.
- Do not create unnecessary abstractions, utility packages, or helper functions for one-off operations.
- Do not add config options, features, or agent support without consulting the user.
- Do not attempt to fix git corruption (broken packfiles, bad objects, etc.) yourself. Always prompt the user to resolve it.
