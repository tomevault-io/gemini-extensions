# Repository Guidelines

## Overview

`preloop` reimplements the GitHub Actions control plane and official `actions/runner` in Rust. The unmodified runner registers, polls, executes, and reports against it. Also contains `runner-watch` for protocol conformance testing.

## Crates


| Crate                               | Role                                                                                       |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `preloop-runner-server`                | HTTP control plane: `/_apis/…` (runner protocol) + `/api/v1/…` (native REST) + `/broker/…` |
| `preloop-gha-parser`                   | Workflow YAML → typed model → job DAG/matrix expansion                                     |

| `preloop-runner`                       | Rust runner: Listener + Worker (faithful to `actions/runner` v2.336.0)                     |

| `preloop-conformance` / `runner-watch` | Conformance harnesses and protocol-diff tooling                                            |


## Commands

```sh
just test-ci    # fmt-check + clippy + test (the full gate)
just serve      # cargo run --release -p preloop-runner-server -- serve --listen 127.0.0.1:9090
just dogfood    # E2E with real runner
```

## Key Conventions

- **Toolchain**: Rust 1.97, `cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets`.
- **Error handling**: `anyhow` at top-level; `ApiError` in HTTP handlers; `thiserror` enums in libraries.
- **State**: in-memory behind `Arc<Mutex<…>>` + `Notify`/broadcast. Secrets use `SecretString` — call `expose()` only at protocol boundaries.
- **Wire compatibility**: `/_apis/…` is the source of truth. Validate protocol changes against the **official runner**, not only unit tests.
- **Broker path only**: all work targets the modern broker + Twirp results-service protocol (v2.329.0+).
- **ARM64 local target**: smolvm on Apple Silicon.
- **Store backends**: the `Store` trait (`store.rs`, async, object-safe) is the only surface the server sees; backends are SQLite (`store.rs`, default, `<state_dir>/preloop.db`) and Postgres (`store_pg.rs`), selected via `PRELOOP_STORE_URL` (`sqlite://<path>` / bare path / `postgres://…`). Both are single-writer: one connection behind a mutex. Two servers on the same SQLite file (or same PG database) still diverge in-memory — the DB is a restart source, not a shared bus.
- **Store is best-effort**: in-memory state is the source of truth, the database is a restart source. Store failures are logged; the affected event is still broadcast (see `state.rs::emit`). Per-backend `MIGRATIONS` is the schema source of truth (SQLite: `PRAGMA user_version`; PG: `schema_migrations` version table).
- **Encryption-at-rest is obfuscation, not security**: `<state_dir>/hmac-key.bin` and `preloop.db` sit in the same directory; the store key is HKDF-derived from the JWT HMAC key with domain separation. It stops a stolen DB file, not a compromised state dir. Key loss = unbootable state. The envelope is backend-independent (sealed blobs), so it applies to Postgres rows too — for remote PG, rely on TLS + DB auth instead.

## Agent Preferences

- **Be critical.** Push back with evidence when a plan hides risk or a claim is wrong.
- **Composability is the goal.** Any runner should work with any server. Never introduce protocol divergences.
- **Local CI is mandatory.** After every large chunk of work or task, run `just test-ci` to validate the changes and dogfood the workflow.
- **Drop-in workflows.** Users should be able to run their workflows in local CI unmodified.

## Debugging Dogfood (mandatory)

When investigating CI behavior — queue stalls, job failures, check-run state,
runner churn — default to preloop's own debug features before log-diving.
Dogfood them; any divergence from `docs/debug-sessions.md` is a bug to report.

- **Sessions**: failed jobs pause into debug sessions (state machine in
  `docs/debug-sessions.md` §2). List: `preloop debug` or
  `GET /api/v1/debug/sessions` (native bearer). Attach:
  `preloop debug [<ref>]` — in-VM verbs `:retry`, `:retry --sync`,
  `:retry --from <step>`, `:sync`, `:export`. Non-interactive:
  `preloop debug --verdict retry|continue|abort`.
- **Agent API** (native bearer): lease
  `POST /api/v1/agent/debug/sessions/<id>/lease`, stream
  `GET .../events`, drive `POST .../operations`, audit `GET .../audit`.
- **DAP**: attach over WS `GET /api/v1/runs/<run_id>/debug` (native bearer);
  `preloop-dap` bridges DAP to the session state machine.
- **Hold VMs**: `preloop run --preserve-on-failure` keeps the VM for a later
  `preloop shell`/attach when nothing can answer interactively (piped/detached/CI).
- Leaked sessions (terminal states `abandoned`, `aborted`, or sessions that
  never close) count as findings, not noise.
