## What is Pragma?

Pragma is a **macOS + Linux + Windows desktop app** (Tauri v2) moving toward a
host-server + thin native-client architecture. The host runs persistent, worktree-scoped
terminal sessions through `pragma-server`; native clients connect over a local Unix
socket (on all three platforms), or over a bridge that presents a remote SSH host or a
WSL distribution as one. Plugins for opencode, Claude Code, and Cursor report status through
the `pragma-cli` helper.

## North star: clean, reusable, consistent

The overriding priority is a **clean, reusable architecture** with **consistent rules
across TypeScript and Rust**. When you write code:

- **Reuse before you write.** Search for an existing helper, component, or constant
  first. Lift duplicated logic into a shared location the moment it appears twice.
- **Do not be afraid to create a new package or directory.** If something is shared,
  or _could_ be shared, give it a home (`packages/*`). If a value is referenced in
  more than one place, it belongs in `@pragma-sh/constants`, not inline. Small,
  single-purpose packages are encouraged.
- **One source of truth.** Never copy a value across the TS/Rust boundary by hand —
  put it in `@pragma-sh/constants` (see `packages/constants/AGENTS.md`).
- **Keep the two languages in lockstep.** The same concept should be named, layered,
  and error-handled the same way in TypeScript and Rust. See _Code standards_ below.
- **Suggest sweeping changes.** If you see a cleaner structure,
  propose and make it — restructuring for clarity is welcome, not discouraged.
- **Host-tool plugins stay out of core — ask first.** A host-tool plugin/agent package
  (`packages/*-plugin`, such as opencode/Claude/Cursor integrations) is
  **self-contained data plus its own bundled assets**. It must **not** add or modify code
  in pragma core (`apps/pragma`, including `src-tauri`), the server
  (`crates/pragma-server`), the UI, the CLI (`crates/pragma-cli`), or the SDK
  (`packages/sdk`) **without explicit owner permission**. A host-tool plugin installs
  itself through its host tool's own plugin mechanism, never through per-plugin Pragma
  code. Launchable Pragma agents are contributed through the `@pragma-sh/plugin`
  `defineAgent` API (or the built-in Pragma plugin), not per-tool JSON files copied by
  core. There are deliberately **no** per-tool core installers: the old
  `opencode_plugin.rs` / `claude_plugin.rs` installers were **removed**. The generic
  Pragma plugin runtime is the exception: infrastructure for `.pragma/config.json` plugins lives in
  `packages/plugin`, `apps/pragma/src/plugins`, and `apps/pragma/src-tauri/src/plugins.rs`.

## Keeping this guide current (self-improvement)

**This document is living. If it is wrong, stale, or incomplete, fix it as part of your
change — that is expected, not optional.** A guide that drifts from reality is worse
than no guide.

- **Edit the relevant AGENTS.md in the same change that makes it outdated.** Add a
  package, move a file, change a command, bump a tool, adopt a new pattern → update the
  matching AGENTS.md (root and/or child) in the same commit. Because `CLAUDE.md` is a
  symlink to the root AGENTS.md, both humans and agents stay in sync automatically.
- **Mirror it in the skills.** Canonical user-facing skill sources live under `skills/`
  and are symlinked into `.agents/skills/` (which `.claude/skills` also exposes). Internal
  contributor skills live directly in `.agents/skills/`, so that directory contains both
  internal and user-facing skills. If you
  change a workflow here, update the relevant skill (`pragma-architecture`,
  `shared-constants`, `tauri-command`, `code-quality`, `pragma`) too, and
  add a new skill when you add a substantial new workflow.
- **Ship the website with the feature.** A user-visible change is not done until
  `apps/www` matches it: add or update the `/docs` page (and its `meta.json` entry), the
  landing-page copy or bento card when the feature is worth announcing, and any page the
  change makes wrong — wiki, CLI, SDK, keybindings, disk layout. Same change, same commit,
  exactly like the AGENTS.md rule above. A feature nobody can read about does not exist.
- **When you discover something the hard way, write it down.** A non-obvious gotcha, a
  setup step, a "don't do X because Y" — capture it here (or in the relevant child
  AGENTS.md) so the next person (or agent) doesn't rediscover it.
- **Prefer fixing the guide over working around it.**
- **Keep it concise.** Prune advice that no longer applies. Length is not authority;
  accuracy is.

**Where things go:**

- User-tunable global settings live in `~/.pragma/config.json` (plugins under `plugins[]`,
  remote-access tunnel under `tunnel` = `{ command, urlPattern }`, agent alerts under
  `agentStatus` = `{ notificationsEnabled, soundName }`, the System 1 endpoint under
  `system1` = `{ baseUrl, model }` (its key is an owner-only file, never config), the "Created with Pragma"
  pull-request footer under `github` = `{ prSignature }`, desktop auto-update overrides
  under `updates` = `{ checkUrl, autoDownload }`). Keyboard shortcuts are separate:
  `~/.pragma/keybindings.json`, overridable per project. Shipped defaults for such settings
  belong in `@pragma-sh/constants` (e.g. `tunnel.defaultCommand`, `agentStatus.*`, `updates.*`)
  so Rust and TS agree, never hard-coded in one language.
- First-run onboarding is **one** flow (`apps/pragma/src/components/onboarding`), not a
  stack of setup modals: a progress-bar dialog whose every step is skippable, followed by
  a `data-tour`-anchored guided tour. Adding first-run behaviour means adding a step there.
  The Pragma skill it can install globally is `skills/pragma`, compiled into the app.
- Desktop Settings is a full-frame UI wrapper over global/project `.pragma/config.json`
  and `keybindings.json`; native `Cmd+,` opens it on macOS. Plugins, Keybindings, Themes,
  and Agent Status have both a global and a project scope (project wins). AI has both too:
  providers and the System 1 connection are global, `automode.md` is per scope. GitHub,
  Other (update server/download), and mobile pairing/gateway history are global-only.
  Storage also has both scopes, but as a _view_ (every project vs. the current one's
  worktrees); only its reminder is persisted, under global `storage.reminder`.
- Worktree disk usage is measured on the owning host: the walk, the gitignored-folder
  list, and the re-checked delete live in `crates/pragma-core/src/storage.rs` behind
  the `filesystem` RPC's `storageScan` / `cancelStorageScan` / `deleteIgnoredFolder`
  ops; the Settings → Storage UI is `apps/pragma/src/components/settings/storage/`, and
  the squarified layout, GrandPerspective palette, and cushion shading it draws
  with are `packages/treemap` (`@pragma-sh/treemap`), which the website also uses for
  its Storage cover. A scan
  runs only while that page is mounted and is cancelled on the host when it unmounts.
- Color overrides live in a separate optional `.pragma/theme.json`, global and per project,
  merged `index.css` defaults <- global <- project. Never restate a shipped default color in
  TS or Rust: `apps/pragma/src/index.css` is the source of truth and the token catalog is
  parsed from it. Sourced built-in palettes live in `apps/pragma/src/lib/theme-presets.ts`.
  See _User themes_ in `apps/pragma/AGENTS.md`.
- Agent alert clips live in `.pragma/assets/sounds` (home directory for global clips,
  project root for project clips) and are read through the owning host, so a remote
  project's clips work the same as a local one's. A starter set (CC0, from
  `akx/Notifications`) ships in `apps/pragma/src-tauri/resources/sounds` and is copied
  into the home-directory scope on first launch — only when that directory is missing,
  so a deleted clip stays deleted.
- The pull-request footer is text-only — a heading, a tagline, a small "Open worktree"
  link, and the opt-out line. It references **no** hosted image: a raw URL on `main` would
  be a published contract baked into other people's repositories. Keep it that way.
- A value used by both frontend and backend → `packages/constants` (`values.json`).
- A value/helper used by multiple frontend modules → `apps/pragma/src/lib/`.
- A helper/type that could be reused by a future app → a new `packages/*` package.
- A typed JS wrapper over the bundled Pragma CLI → `packages/sdk` (`@pragma-sh/sdk`).
- Anything that talks to a System 1 model (Jev's `systemone` evaluate endpoint) →
  `packages/system1` (`@pragma-sh/system1`), which knows nothing about Pragma. **Auto
  mode** — picking an agent, model, and reasoning effort for a launch — is built on it
  in `packages/ai-helpers/src/auto-select.ts` (run by the `pragma-ai auto-select`
  sidecar command), fed by model benchmarks (`model-insights.ts`), Terminal-Bench harness
  results (`harness-insights.ts`), and `automode.md` (`automode.ts`, global
  `~/.pragma/automode.md` overridden by `<project>/.pragma/automode.md`). The key lives in
  `apps/pragma/src-tauri/src/system1.rs` (owner-only `SecretFile`, like the GitHub token)
  and never crosses IPC back to the webview. The **Auto** row is part of
  `AgentModelSelector` itself; a launching dialog wraps its submit in `useAutoSubmit(submit)`
  and passes the picker `autoRegistry` plus `autoTarget` (via `useAutoTarget(prompt)`).
  System 1 is asked only on submit — the picker shows just "Auto", never a live preview.
  **AI merge-conflict resolution** (the PR pane's Resolve Merge Conflicts) is the second
  System 1 consumer: `packages/ai-helpers/src/merge-conflicts.ts` decides,
  `crates/pragma-core/src/merge_conflicts.rs` owns the git side (host `git` RPCs that
  re-check the merge identity and index before writing or committing),
  `apps/pragma/src-tauri/src/merge_conflicts.rs` drives the model calls, and
  `apps/pragma/src/components/github/MergeConflictControls.tsx` is the card. It requires
  both built-in AI and a System 1 key.
- The Pragma mark itself — its geometry, or the colours it is painted in →
  `packages/brand` (`@pragma-sh/brand`), which emits SVG strings and knows nothing
  about platforms. Which icon slots exist and what each demands stays with the
  app that ships them (`apps/pragma-go/scripts/icon-variants.ts`). Never
  hand-draw the mark a second time.
- Agent-authored scratchpad runtime and UI components → `packages/scratchpad` (`@pragma-sh/scratchpad`).
- The scratchpad **file contract** (managed frontmatter, agent attachment, the
  sibling comment-thread file) → `packages/scratchpad-contract`
  (`@pragma-sh/scratchpad-contract`); the read-only web-view renderer native clients
  embed → `packages/scratchpad-viewer` (`@pragma-sh/scratchpad-viewer`), which
  re-exports the contract. The desktop, the SDK, and the mobile client all import
  it — do not re-implement frontmatter parsing or comment serialization.
- Anything a client does _with_ a scratchpad over the gateway (comment on one,
  attach an agent, prompt the attached agent) → `client.scratchpads` in
  `packages/sdk`, not a per-client reimplementation.
- Public APIs for pure TypeScript Pragma plugins → `packages/plugin` (`@pragma-sh/plugin`).
- Plugin templates/scaffolding → `packages/create-pragma-plugin`.
- A pure-TS sample/exercise plugin (sidebar tab, sidebar card, web view, SDK event hook) →
  `packages/dev-test-plugin` (`@pragma-sh/dev-test-plugin`).
- Fanout orchestration (one prompt into several isolated attempts, then keeping
  one) lives on the host: the durable record and the state machine in
  `crates/pragma-server/src/fanouts.rs`, the side effects behind its
  `FanoutHost` seam in `crates/pragma-server/src/fanout_host.rs`, and the pure
  rules (selector resolution, branch naming, status roll-up, scratchpad
  promotion naming) in `crates/pragma-core/src/fanout.rs`. The CLI
  (`pragma-cli fanout`), the SDK (`client.fanouts`), and the desktop are three
  callers of the same `fanouts` RPC — never a second implementation.
- Anything that measures perceived terminal latency → `packages/bench`
  (`bun run benchmark`). It drives a real dev window; do not add a headless
  variant that claims to measure rendering.
- Worktree-scoped whiteboards live on the host: SQLite CRUD/search and native PNG rendering
  in `crates/pragma-core/src/whiteboards.rs`, with `whiteboards` RPC callers in CLI, SDK,
  desktop, and scratchpad bridge. Scene JSON stays lossless; edits use optimistic versions.
- A reusable UI primitive → `apps/pragma/src/components/ui/` (prefer `shadcn add`).
- Anything that calls the Rust backend → `apps/pragma/src/lib/tauri.ts` (never call
  `invoke()` directly from components).
- GitHub REST/GraphQL → `apps/pragma/src/lib/github.ts` only (never instantiate Octokit
  in components). See `apps/pragma/AGENTS.md`.
- PTY/session ownership → `crates/pragma-server`; native client frame I/O / SSH and WSL
  bridges → `crates/pragma-client`; localhost HTTP/JSON translation →
  `crates/pragma-gateway`; host business logic → `crates/pragma-core`; wire framing →
  `crates/pragma-protocol`; CLI/status reporting → `crates/pragma-cli`.
- Anything that differs between operating systems → `crates/pragma-platform`. Never a
  bare `#[cfg(unix)]` at the call site (see _Platform targets_).

## Common commands

All commands run from the repo root unless noted. We use **bun** as the package
manager and **turbo** as the task runner.

```bash
bun install                # Install all workspace deps

# App
bun run dev                # Run the desktop app (Tauri dev, "Pragma Dev" branding)
bun run dev:pragma         # Same as `bun run dev`, named explicitly
bun run dev:www            # Run the marketing + docs site (Next.js, http://localhost:3000)
bun run dev:command -- <dev-id> "<command>" # Open command in a new terminal tab in that dev build
bun run --filter pragma tauri:build   # Build the desktop app (macOS/Linux/Windows bundles)

```

## Pragma Go on the web

`apps/pragma-go` builds for iOS, Android, **and** the browser from one source
tree. The browser build is served by `pragma-gateway` under
`constants.gateway.web.basePath` (`/web`), so a user who has the tunnel URL can
open the client without installing anything.

- **One app, platform extensions.** Anything a browser cannot do lives behind a
  `*.web.ts(x)` twin, never a `Platform.OS === "web"` branch scattered through a
  screen: `secret-store` (keychain vs Web Storage), `gateway-fetch`
  (`expo/fetch` vs the platform `fetch`), `GlassSurface`, `IconSymbol`
  (SF Symbols vs Lucide), `ui/menu-view`, `ScratchpadWebView` (native web view
  vs sandboxed `<iframe>`), and `use-widget-sync`. A `.web` twin also keeps
  native-only module graphs — `@expo/ui/swift-ui`, `react-native-webview` — out
  of the web bundle entirely.
- **The bundle is a Tauri resource, not bytes in a binary.** `web:stage` runs
  the Expo export and writes `apps/pragma/src-tauri/resources/web/`. Keeping it
  out of `pragma-gateway` means a web-only change never triggers a Rust
  rebuild. Set `PRAGMA_SKIP_WEB=1` to skip the export in a build that does not
  need it.
- **The gateway serves a manifest, never a directory.** `stage-web-bundle.ts`
  emits `manifest.json`; the gateway loads it into a map and answers each
  request by **key lookup**. A request path is never joined onto a filesystem
  path, so traversal is not expressible rather than merely blocked. Text assets
  are stored gzip-only and served that way; the entry point answers any
  unmatched non-file path so client-side routes work on reload.
- **`/web` is deliberately unauthenticated**, because a browser cannot attach a
  bearer token to a `<script src>`. The bundle is public code; every `/v1`
  route stays behind the token. The desktop's pairing panel offers a link with
  the token in the URL **fragment**, which is never sent to a server — the app
  consumes it on load and strips it from the address bar.
- **Wide layouts.** iPadOS gets the system sidebar for free via
  `NativeTabs sidebarAdaptable`. Web and Android tablets use the shared
  `AppSidebar`, swapped in for the tab bar above `WIDE_LAYOUT_BREAKPOINT`. Only
  the bar is exchanged, not the navigator, so resizing never resets navigation.

## Code standards (consistent across TypeScript & Rust)

Formatting is **automated and non-negotiable** — oxfmt for TS, rustfmt for Rust. Don't
argue with the formatter; run it. Both are enforced in CI and auto-applied on commit.

**A file with a machine writer cannot also be oxfmt's.** Anything generated is listed in
`.oxfmtrc.json`'s `ignorePatterns`, because the generator and the formatter disagree
forever and CI is the one that loses. Both writers here serialize with
`JSON.stringify(value, null, 2)`, which puts every array element on its own line, while
oxfmt collapses short arrays onto one — so each run of the generator re-breaks
`format:check` for the whole repo, on `main` as much as on the branch:

- `**/CHANGELOG.md`, `packages/constants/values.json` and
  `apps/pragma/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` are rewritten by **Release Please** on every
  release, and those rewrites land on `main` when the release PR merges. So is every
  agent-plugin manifest listed as an `extra-files` entry in `release-please-config.json`
  (`packages/*-plugin/**/plugin.json`, `kimi.plugin.json`) — adding a new `extra-files`
  JSON path means adding it to `ignorePatterns` in the same change.
- `packages/constants/values.json` additionally has a **second** writer:
  `packages/constants/scripts/generate-types.ts` rewrites it whenever
  `daemon.protocolVersion` drifts from `crates/pragma-protocol/Cargo.toml`. In CI
  `format-check` runs downstream of `generate`, so that rewrite happens _before_ the
  check — it fails on a file nobody edited.

- `apps/pragma/src-tauri/src/testdata/**` holds a real signed `release.json`; one
  reformatted byte and its CI signature no longer verifies.

Don't "fix" one of these by reformatting it; the next release or the next `bun run
generate` undoes it. Add the path to `ignorePatterns` instead, and remember these files
are no longer covered by `bun run format`.

Shared rules:

- **Strictness is on, everywhere.** TS runs in `strict` mode with
  `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `noUnusedLocals/Parameters`, etc. Rust runs clippy
  `all` + `pedantic` as `-D warnings` and `unsafe_code = "forbid"`. Treat warnings as
  errors. Don't silence a lint without a comment explaining why.
- **Errors are values, surfaced explicitly.** TS: prefer returning/throwing typed
  errors and narrowing with `instanceof`; never swallow. Rust: return `Result`, use
  `?`; reserve `expect`/`panic!` for genuinely-unrecoverable startup invariants.
- **No magic values.** Cross-boundary values live in `@pragma-sh/constants`. Frontend-only
  shared values live in `src/lib/`.
- **Imports are grouped** (oxfmt/rustfmt enforce ordering): external deps, then
  workspace packages, then local/relative.
- **Public items are documented.** Exported TS functions/types get a JSDoc line; public
  Rust items get a `///` doc comment.
- **Keep the IPC surface typed and centralized.** Every Tauri command has a matching
  typed wrapper in `src/lib/tauri.ts` and a `#[tauri::command]` in `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`
  with the same name.

## Commits

[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org), enforced locally and in CI:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
```

- **types:** `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`, `revert`
- **scope:** optional; prefer a package/app name (`pragma`, `constants`, `ci`, `deps`)
- Examples: `feat(pragma): add settings window`, `fix(constants): correct min width`

## Git hooks (Husky)

- **pre-commit:** `lint-staged` auto-fixes staged files (`oxlint --fix`, `oxfmt --write`,
  `rustfmt`). Fixing — not just checking — is the local behavior.
- **commit-msg:** commitlint validates the message.
- **pre-push:** full `typecheck` + `cargo fmt --check` + sidecar staging via
  `bun run --filter pragma sidecar:server` (resolves Git Bash on Windows) +
  `cargo check` + `fallow:check` (fallow audit, blocks on TS/JS issues this branch
  introduces vs `main`).

CI re-verifies everything in **check** mode (it never auto-fixes): commitlint, oxlint,
oxfmt `--check`, typecheck, `cargo fmt --check`, clippy, both test suites, and a
compile-only Tauri build on macOS, Linux, **and** Windows.

**Releases are cut by Release Please.** `.github/workflows/release.yml` updates one
combined release PR from Conventional Commits. Merging it creates component GitHub
Releases; a desktop (`pragma-v*`) release then builds signed installers for every
advertised OS/architecture/package format, builds a tarred React UI overlay, and uploads
them with a signed `release.json`, then marks that release as the repository's **Latest**.
That flag is load-bearing: the website's Download button links to `/releases/latest`, and
Release Please gives _every_ component release GitHub's default `make_latest` — it has no
option for it — so whichever plugin publishes last would otherwise take it.
`scripts/pin-latest-desktop-release.ts` hands it back to the newest `pragma-v*` release that
ships a `release.json` (never an empty tag), both at the end of `publish-desktop` and in
`pin-latest-desktop` on runs that release no desktop. That manifest is `reload` only when every substantive change since the
previous desktop tag is under `apps/pragma/src/`; any native/server/tooling change is
`restart`. Desktop-shipped crates/packages use Release Please's `linked-versions` group,
so changing one also creates a desktop release instead of shipping under an unrelated
component version. **That group must be configured `"merge": false`.** Its default
collapses the whole group into one extra candidate that carries no version of its own,
and the `node-workspace` plugin drops every versionless candidate outright — so with the
default the app, all seven crates and every published package silently disappear from
the release PR and no `pragma-v*` tag is ever cut. Two more traps live in the same file:
a `0.0.0` manifest entry is _not_ a previous release, so `bump-minor-pre-major` never
runs and the first release falls through to `initial-version` (default `1.0.0`, hence
the explicit `0.1.0`); and `apps/pragma/src-tauri` is a Cargo workspace member whose
crate is named `pragma`, so `cargo-workspace` invents a candidate that shadows the real
desktop component — it has its own entry with component `pragma-desktop` and
`skip-github-release`, which is also what writes `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` (an `extra-files`
entry for it would be a second writer). `scripts/release-config.test.ts` guards all
three. **A deliberate version jump (the 1.0.0 cut) is a `release-as` on every desktop-group
package, and it is one-shot:** `release-as` pins every later release too, so delete it
in the change after that version ships — the same test fails while a pin equals the
manifest version, and fails if the group is pinned unevenly. **Never put a `Release-As:`
footer in a commit message** — the 1.0.0 cut did, and it resurfaced a release later.
`pragma-desktop` has no GitHub release to anchor on (`skip-github-release`), so Release
Please gives it every commit back to the _oldest_ release it is looking for (`www` and
`pragma-go` rarely release), and a footer found there pins the whole linked group: the
release PR after 1.0.1 proposed downgrading everything to 1.0.0. The top-level
`last-release-sha` (the 1.0.1 release commit) is the floor that keeps those footers out of
the window; move it forward only after checking `git log <old>..<new> -- apps/www
apps/pragma-go` has no unreleased `feat`/`fix`, since commits below it are invisible to
every component. Verify a config change without merging anything:
`npx release-please release-pr --token=$(gh auth token) --repo-url=pragma-sh/pragma
--target-branch=<your pushed branch> --dry-run --trace` — it reads the config from the
_branch_, never your working tree, so the branch has to be pushed first. Release Please rejects `..` in `extra-files`; shared version fields in
`packages/constants/values.json` therefore belong to the linked `constants` component,
not to cross-component paths from the app or protocol crate. **A version an
independently-shipped artifact embeds must stay out of the release train entirely** —
`apps/pragma-go` has no `extra-files` (rewriting `expo.version` changes the Expo
fingerprint and cuts every shipped build off from OTA updates) and `gateway.apiVersion`
has no writer at all; `scripts/release-config.test.ts` fails if either regresses.
`apps/pragma-go` is also `release-type: simple` (versioned by its `version.txt`), which
keeps it out of `node-workspace`: as a `node` package it was released — with Android and
iOS store builds — every time the desktop group bumped a package it depends on.
Merging the release PR is also what deploys the website: production Vercel builds are
gated on a Release Please commit (see `apps/www/AGENTS.md`), so a merge to `main` that is
not a release only produces previews — unless its PR carries the `deploy:www` label, which
ships content that can go live on its own (a blog post, copy) right away.

**Nine packages are published to npm on every desktop release** — `@pragma-sh/sdk`,
`@pragma-sh/plugin`, `@pragma-sh/automations`, `@pragma-sh/scratchpad`,
`@pragma-sh/scratchpad-contract`, `@pragma-sh/scratchpad-viewer`, `@pragma-sh/constants`,
`@pragma-sh/sidecar-kit` and `create-pragma-plugin` — by the `publish-packages` job through
`scripts/publish-packages.ts`. They are all in the linked `desktop` group, so one release
moves them to one version. Three rules hold that together:

- **`node-workspace` rewrites the internal ranges, and `workspace:*` must never reach a manifest here.** npm does **not** substitute the `workspace:` protocol at pack or publish time — verified: both `npm pack` and `npm pack -w` emit `"workspace:*"` verbatim, which no consumer can install. Internal dependencies are therefore plain `^<version>` ranges, which bun still resolves to the workspace package locally, and `publish-packages.ts` fails the release if any range stops naming the version its sibling is publishing.
- **A folder spec needs a leading `./`.** `npm publish packages/sdk` resolves as the GitHub shorthand `github:packages/sdk` and dies in `git ls-remote`; `./packages/sdk` is a directory. The same applies to `npm pack`.
- **Publishing is irreversible**, so `scripts/publish-packages.ts` is a dry run unless passed `--publish`, and it skips a version already on the registry so a partially-failed job can be re-run.

Publishing needs **no npm token**: every one of the nine names `pragma-sh/pragma` +
`release.yml` as a trusted publisher, so the job's `id-token` authenticates it and signs
provenance. The ten agent plugins under `@pragma-sh` trust
`.github/workflows/plugins.yml` instead, so a plugin release is published by
`release.yml`'s `publish-plugins` job **dispatching** that workflow at the plugin's tag,
never by `release.yml` itself. Two consequences: **renaming `release.yml` silently
breaks all nine** (and renaming `plugins.yml` breaks all ten), since npm verifies the workflow filename, and a **brand-new** package
must be published by hand once before npm will accept a trusted publisher for it: npm
rejects an OIDC publish for an unconfigured package with `404 Not Found - PUT`, never a
403, so the failure reads as if the package did not exist. Configuring one is a CLI step,
not a web-UI one — `npm trust github <package> --file release.yml --repository
pragma-sh/pragma --allow-publish`, which needs npm 11.15.0 or newer and prompts for a 2FA
one-time password. `npm trust list <package>` shows what a package already has. Configure
`RELEASE_PLEASE_TOKEN` with contents + pull-request write
access so release PRs trigger ordinary CI; the workflow falls back to `GITHUB_TOKEN`, but
GitHub suppresses workflows caused by that token. Release builds also require
`TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY`, its password, and `TAURI_SIGNING_PUBLIC_KEY`; every installer
and UI overlay is signed, and production clients reject a missing/invalid signature. The
macOS bundles additionally need the six `APPLE_*` secrets (see _Release secrets_ in
`CONTRIBUTING.md`), and that set is **all or nothing**: an unset secret still reaches the
build as an empty string, the bundler gates on `var_os` — which returns `Some("")` for a
set-but-empty variable — and the job dies at `security import` with
`SecKeychainItemImport: One or more parameters passed to a function were not valid` after
a full release compile, instead of producing an unsigned bundle. Linux
package-manager installs select `.deb` or `.rpm`; AppImage sessions receive no automatic
restart offer until in-place replacement is supported. **No release ships an AppImage** —
the Linux jobs pass `--bundles deb,rpm`, because `tauri.conf.json` also targets AppImage
and its linuxdeploy step needs FUSE, which the ubuntu-24.04 runners restrict
(`failed to run linuxdeploy`). Adding one back means fixing that first. The website update API scans recent
releases through the newest restart manifest, because another monorepo component may be
GitHub's latest release and a client may have skipped a required native release.

**CI is split across two providers, by platform.** [RWX](https://www.rwx.com) runs
Linux containers only — `rwx/base` supports the `ubuntu:*` images and nothing else, and
runners are x86_64/arm64 Linux — so everything that can run on Linux (commitlint, the
TypeScript checks, the Rust checks, the Linux app build) lives in
`.rwx/ci.yml`, and the
macOS and Windows builds plus the Windows Rust suite stay in
`.github/workflows/ci.yml`. **Adding or removing a check means touching both files.**
RWX is a task DAG, not a job list: tasks with no `use:` run in parallel, caching is
content-based (no cache actions — add a `filter:` to keep a task's cache key off files
it doesn't read), and the default task timeout is **10 minutes**, so any long task needs
an explicit `timeout:`. Iterate without pushing via `rwx run .rwx/ci.yml --wait`, and
validate edits with `rwx lint .rwx/ci.yml`; both need `rwx login` first.

The **fallow** audit is a Linux check that is _not_ an RWX task: it lives in
`.github/workflows/fallow.yml`. It scopes to the diff against the base ref and fails on
issues the change introduces. **It runs on GitHub Actions because it writes back to
GitHub.** Posting the sticky PR comment needs `pull_requests: write`,
and RWX cannot mint a token that has it (see below) — so the job uses GitHub's own
`GITHUB_TOKEN`, which makes the comment authored by `github-actions[bot]` instead of by
whichever personal access token happened to be in the RWX vault. `--format
pr-comment-github` prefixes the body with `<!-- fallow-id: fallow-results -->`, and the
job matches that marker to update the existing comment instead of adding one per run.
**Inline annotations are not reproduced** — they came from the action's SARIF upload; the
findings live in the job log and the comment. The job needs `fetch-depth: 0` (fallow
diffs against a real base) _and_ `bun run generate` (fallow resolves imports statically,
so the gitignored `src/generated/**` modules must exist first). It is skipped on
`release-please--branches--*`, which carry only generated version bumps and CHANGELOGs —
no hand-written code to audit and no author to advise. The **Pragma Go ship plan**
(`.github/workflows/pragma-go-ship-plan.yml`) is the other GitHub-writing check and the
mirror image: it runs _only_ on a release PR that bumps `apps/pragma-go/version.txt`, and
keeps a sticky comment saying whether each platform will ship as an OTA update or a new
binary (see _Releases: update or new binary_ in `apps/pragma-go/AGENTS.md`).

**CI clones and fetches with no token — `pragma-sh/pragma` is public.** RWX's
`${{ github.token }}` context is not to be relied on: it can vanish mid-run with
`The context key "github" is not available in this expression`, and it could never write
to a PR anyway — the `rwx-integration` App's installation token is scoped to reading
repository contents, with no `pull_requests` or `issues` permission, so any `gh` call
against them dies with `Resource not accessible by integration (HTTP 403)` — which is how
the fallow comment silently stopped appearing while the task still exited 0. Those
permissions belong to RWX, not to this repo, so they cannot be widened from here; RWX's
own answer is to register a _private_ GitHub App and mint an installation token per run,
since those expire hourly. **Anything that needs to write to GitHub therefore belongs in
`.github/workflows/`, where `GITHUB_TOKEN` grants it directly and the actor is
`github-actions[bot]`.** That is why no RWX task reads a `*-comment-token` secret any
more; the former `fallow-comment-token` vault entry is unused and can be deleted with
`rwx vaults secrets rm --vault default fallow-comment-token`.

## Platform targets

We target **macOS, Linux, and Windows**. `tauri.conf.json` bundles `app`/`dmg` (macOS),
`deb`/`rpm`/`appimage` (Linux), and `msi`/`nsis` (Windows). Don't add Android specifics
without updating this guide and CI.

- **Linux** builds need the GTK/WebKit system libraries — see the `rust`/`build` jobs in
  CI for the exact `apt` list. `xcap` pulls in `libspa-sys` (`libpipewire-0.3-dev`),
  `libgbm-dev`, and `libclang-dev` — all required at link time and must stay in that list.
- **Windows** needs no system packages: the webview is WebView2, which ships with the OS
  on Windows 11 and with the Edge runtime on Windows 10. CI covers x64 on the
  GitHub-hosted `windows-latest` image and ARM64 on `windows-11-arm`; releases use the
  same native runners so Rust, Bun sidecars, Tauri, and NSIS all match the installer
  architecture.
- **The per-user NSIS installer has to stop the sidecars, not just the app.** Windows
  locks a running executable's image, our sidecars outlive the window by design, and a
  per-user NSIS install puts them in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Pragma` — so reinstalling over a live
  instance dies with `Error opening file for writing:
…\AppData\Local\Pragma\pragma-server.exe`. `installer-hooks.nsh` handles this and stays
  keyed to `bundle.externalBin`. The elevated per-machine MSI deliberately relies on
  Windows Installer Restart Manager instead: WiX `util:CloseApplication` matches only by
  executable basename and could otherwise terminate another user's or unrelated process.
  See `apps/pragma/AGENTS.md`.
- **Never spell a shell script's runner as bare `bash` in a package script.** On Windows
  with WSL installed, `bash` on `PATH` is `C:\Windows\system32\bash.exe` — the WSL
  launcher — whose Linux `PATH` has no `rustc`, `cargo`, or `bun`, so the sidecar staging
  dies with `rustc: command not found` (exit 127). CI's `windows-latest` image ships no
  WSL, so this never fires there and only breaks developer machines. Go through
  `scripts/run-shell-script.ts`, which derives Git Bash from the resolved `git.exe`
  (override with `PRAGMA_BASH`) and is a plain `bash` everywhere else.
- **Line endings are pinned by `.gitattributes`.** The build shells out to
  `src-tauri/scripts/*.sh` through Git Bash, and Git for Windows checks files out as CRLF
  by default. A `\r` on the `set -euo pipefail` line fails the build with
  `set: pipefail: invalid option name` (the `\r` hides itself by wrapping the cursor).
  `*.sh` and the Husky hooks are therefore forced to `eol=lf`. After pulling a change to
  `.gitattributes`, an existing Windows checkout still holds the old CRLF files — refresh
  it with `git rm --cached -r . && git reset --hard` (commit or stash first: that command
  discards uncommitted work).
- **A Windows checkout has no real symlinks — `core.symlinks=false`.** Git writes each
  one as a small text file holding its target path, so `CLAUDE.md` is literally the nine
  bytes `AGENTS.md`. Any formatter that matches it will "fix" it (oxfmt appends a trailing
  newline) and the symlink is then broken for everyone on macOS/Linux. `CLAUDE.md` is in
  `.oxfmtrc.json`'s `ignorePatterns` for exactly this reason; the other tracked symlinks
  (`.claude/skills`, `.agents/skills/*`) are extension-less and no formatter claims them.
  If you add a symlink whose name a formatter or linter would match, ignore it there too.
- **The whole tree is `eol=lf`, not just `*.sh`.** Every blob here is already LF; the
  hazard is `text=auto` **alone**, which lets `core.autocrlf=true` write CRLF into a
  Windows working tree. oxfmt enforces LF, so `bun run format:check` (and thus
  `bun run check`) fails on _every_ file on Windows while CI stays green — Linux/macOS
  check out LF regardless. Diagnose this by byte count, not `grep '\r'`: MSYS `grep -U`
  reports CRs inconsistently under Git Bash. Compare `git cat-file -s HEAD:<file>` with
  the on-disk size — a positive difference equal to the line count means the worktree is
  CRLF while the blob is LF.

**Minimum Windows version: 10 version 1809 (build 17763), October 2018.** ConPTY sets
that floor, and it is a hard one — `portable-pty` resolves `CreatePseudoConsole` from
`kernel32.dll` and `expect`s it, so on an older build the server _panics_ (and release
builds are `panic = "abort"`) the first time a terminal opens. The `AF_UNIX` transport
needs only 1803, so it is not the binding constraint. Opening a **WSL** session needs
1903 (18362) or later, because that is when `wsl.exe --list --verbose` and WSL2 arrived;
PowerShell sessions have no such requirement. Nothing checks any of this at startup, so
a user below the floor gets a panic rather than a message naming the reason; if that
becomes a real support burden, the place to fix it is a probe in `pragma-platform`.

**Never add a `#[cfg(unix)]` block with a silently-empty `#[cfg(not(unix))]` twin.** That
pattern is how a security guarantee quietly disappears — it is exactly what let the
GitHub token be written world-readable on Windows. Platform differences belong in
`crates/pragma-platform`, which owns nine seams and has a real implementation for each
on every target:

| Seam      | What it owns                                                                 |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ipc`     | The local socket: `AF_UNIX` everywhere, `uds_windows` on Windows             |
| `path`    | Canonical paths external programs accept (no Windows `\\?\` verbatim prefix) |
| `perms`   | Owner-only files/dirs: `0600`/`0700` on Unix, an `icacls` ACL on Windows     |
| `process` | Kill, kill-tree, liveness, the process table, and windowless child spawning  |
| `shell`   | Which shell a PTY launches, and its interactive arguments                    |
| `wsl`     | Enumerating installed WSL distributions (empty, never an error, off Windows) |
| `power`   | Holding the system awake (a helper child that dies with its owner)           |
| `install` | Replacing the installed app with a verified update and relaunching it        |
| `disk`    | Bytes a file occupies on disk and hard-link identity (storage accounting)    |

Three of those are easy to bypass by reflex, and every bypass is a visible bug on Windows:

- **Canonicalize with `pragma_platform::path::canonicalize`, never `std::fs`'s.** `std`
  returns `\\?\C:\…`, which git reads as a UNC path and refuses.
- **Spawn with `pragma_platform::process::command` (or `process_env::command`, which
  wraps it), never a bare `Command::new`.** A console program started from a GUI process
  pops a console window on Windows unless `CREATE_NO_WINDOW` is set.
- **Name executables with `pragma_client::executable_name`, never a bare string.** It
  appends `EXE_SUFFIX`, so `pragma-cli` becomes `pragma-cli.exe` on Windows. This applies
  to a path you _write_ as much as one you read: `agent_cli` copied the helper to a
  suffix-less name, so the copy was both unreadable on the next launch and not executable
  by agents resolving it from `PATH` — startup logged only
  `failed to install pragma-cli: os error 2`.

Two more rules that are not seams but bite the same way:

- **A path is not a string.** Compare with `Path`, not `String`: `Path` treats `/` and `\`
  as equivalent separators on Windows, so `Path::new(a) == Path::new(b)` holds where
  `a == b` fails. Never assert on a `"dir/file"` suffix — build it with `join`. And test
  absolute paths with `Path::is_absolute`, never `starts_with('/')`, which misses every
  Windows form (`C:\…`, `\\?\C:\…`) — that check silently rejected absolute
  `plugins[].path` entries as unsupported npm specifiers.
- **Clear the read timeout on a long-lived stream.** `configure_stream` sets a 5s read
  timeout so a wedged server cannot hang startup, but a subscription is mostly idle:
  leave it on and every quiet 5s looks like a dropped connection, so the bridge warns and
  reconnects forever (`os error 10060` on Windows, `WouldBlock` on Unix). Call
  `set_read_timeout(None)` once the subscribe response arrives, as
  `pragma_client::open_event_stream` and the `agent_events` bridge do.

### Windows session modes

Windows runs terminals in one of two worlds, and they are served differently:

- **PowerShell** — a Windows-native `pragma-server.exe` drives ConPTY through
  `portable-pty`. `pwsh.exe` is preferred over `powershell.exe`; note PowerShell takes
  `-NoLogo`, **not** the POSIX `-l`.
- **WSL** — the ordinary Linux `pragma-server` runs _unchanged inside the distribution_
  and is reached like a remote host. This is not an implementation detail to optimise
  away: the agent plugins (`pragma-cli`, the opencode and Claude hooks) run inside WSL
  and connect to that Linux Unix socket, so a Windows-native server could never serve
  them. WSL2 cannot reach a Windows named pipe and Windows cannot open the Linux socket,
  so the bridge relays over the standard streams of a `wsl.exe` process
  (`pragma-server --relay`). See `crates/pragma-client/src/wsl.rs` for why that beat
  forwarding a port over localhost.

**The two WSL layers, and which one is built.** Selecting a WSL shell and serving a WSL
session are separate problems, and only the first is wired up today:

- **Shell selection (built).** A session can launch `wsl.exe -d <distro>` on the host's
  own ConPTY. The chosen shell travels as a `ShellProfile` (`@pragma-sh/constants`) on the
  `Spawn` request, is resolved by `pragma_platform::shell::resolve_profile_launch`, and
  is persisted on the tab (`tabs.shell_backend` / `shell_distro`) so a respawn after a
  server restart returns to the same shell. The user picks it in the new-tab menu, or as
  a default under Settings → Terminal.
- **Host-level WSL (not built).** `start_wsl_bridge` exists in `pragma-client` but
  nothing calls it. Until it does, a WSL terminal is served by the _Windows_ server, so
  the `PRAGMA_*` environment the session exports names Windows paths that the Linux side
  cannot open — agent plugins running inside such a tab do not report status. Wiring
  that up means registering the distribution as a host (mirroring `ssh_host.rs`) rather
  than adding another shell.

A project selects its shell in `.pragma/config.json` under `terminal`: `shell` names the
native program, `backend`/`distro` choose the world it runs in, and `hiddenDistros`
trims the picker. Both Settings scopes are honoured — the project's file wins and the one
under the home directory is the global default behind it — and each field falls back
independently, so a project that pins only `shell` still inherits the global `backend`.
Defaults live in `@pragma-sh/constants` under `platform` and `terminalDefaults`.

## Testing

- **TS:** Vitest. Co-locate `*.test.ts(x)` next to the code. Frontend tests run under
  jsdom (`src/test/setup.ts`); mock the Tauri API rather than the native shell.
- **Rust:** `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` next to the code; `cargo test --workspace`.
- Add a test with every behavior change. Keep tests fast and deterministic.
- **Never build a package from a `pretest` hook.** `test` depends on `build` in
  `turbo.json`, so a package's own bundle is already there. A `pretest` that
  runs `bun run build` races the turbo `build` task for the same package — two bundlers
  writing one `dist/`, and the loser reads a half-written file
  (`ENOENT: … dist/index.cjs`). It only fires when both land in the same wave, so it
  passes locally and fails in CI.
- **A test must pass on all three platforms, and CI only proves that for the ones it
  runs.** The `rust-windows` job runs the full suite, so a POSIX-only assumption is a red
  build, not a local curiosity. The recurring offenders:
  - **`git init` in a fixture inherits the host's config.** Git for Windows ships
    `core.autocrlf=true` system-wide, so checked-out fixtures come back CRLF and every
    `"…\n"` assertion fails. Pin `core.autocrlf=false` + `core.eol=lf` **in the repo**
    (see `init_repo` in `pragma-core/src/git.rs`) — `git -c` on the test's own commands is
    not enough, because the code under test runs its own `git checkout`/`pull`, which read
    only the repository config.
  - **`PATH` is `;`-separated on Windows.** Build fixtures with `std::env::join_paths`,
    never a literal `"/a:/b"`, or the whole list arrives as one opaque entry and the
    assertion fails for the wrong reason.
  - **Shell output is not portable.** `pwd` under Git Bash prints an MSYS path
    (`/c/Users/…`) that never equals the Win32 path `canonicalize` returns. Assert on
    something the shell cannot reformat — e.g. `cat` a marker file that only resolves from
    the intended cwd. Likewise, `stty` is unavailable in the Windows PowerShell shell;
    query `$Host.UI.RawUI.WindowSize` when a test needs the active PTY dimensions.
  - **A bounded subscriber channel drops a slow test.** A session disconnects an output
    subscriber whose channel is full (`fan_out` in `pragma-server/src/session.rs`), so a
    test that takes one frame per `recv_timeout` loses the stream outright when the shell
    repaints in a burst — PowerShell does exactly that after a resize. Drain everything
    already queued each pass with `try_recv`, and treat `Disconnected` as a failure rather
    than spinning to the deadline.
  - **A `#[cfg(unix)]`-only setup step leaves a vacuous test.** `fs::rejects_symlink_escape`
    created its symlink only on Unix, so on Windows it asserted against a link that was
    never there. Windows symlinks also need Developer Mode or admin — skip explicitly when
    creation fails rather than passing for the wrong reason.
