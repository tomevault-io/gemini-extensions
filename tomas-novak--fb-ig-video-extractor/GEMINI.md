# CLAUDE.md — FB/IG Video Extractor

## What this project does

A Telegram bot that takes a Facebook Reels or Instagram Reels URL, automatically
pulls the video content, transcribes the audio, extracts the place and saves the
metadata to Google Sheets.

Live demo of the map (static sample data, no bot required):
https://tomas-novak.github.io/fb-ig-video-extractor/ (source: `docs/index.html`).

## Architecture

```
User (phone)
  → sends a URL to the Telegram bot
      → Python API (VPS)
          → yt-dlp downloads the VIDEO (not audio – FB offers no audio-only stream to datacenters)
          → Gemini Flash analyzes the video: audio transcript + on-screen text + caption (one call)
          → Google Sheets API saves a row
          → Telegram Bot API replies to the user
```

Note: we send Gemini the whole video (not extracted audio). The reason: on a
datacenter IP Facebook does not offer a separate audio stream, only video. On top
of that Gemini reads the text shown in the video, which makes the place
determination more accurate.

## Stack

- **Runtime**: Python 3.10+ (verified on 3.10.12 on the production VPS; no construct in the code requires 3.11)
- **Web framework**: FastAPI + uvicorn
- **Telegram**: python-telegram-bot or direct Bot API calls
- **Video download**: yt-dlp (format `hd/sd/best`)
- **AI (video analysis)**: Google Gemini 2.5 Flash (multimodal video – audio + image)
- **Database**: Google Sheets (google-auth + gspread)
- **Hosting**: own VPS (Ubuntu 22.04, systemd + Caddy)

## Environment variables

Full reference with descriptions: `.env.example` (kept as the single source
of truth rather than duplicated here).

The three required for any deployment: `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`,
`GOOGLE_SHEETS_ID` (+ `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE` for local dev or
`GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` for servers — see `sheets.py`). `PUBLIC_URL`/
`HOST` matter specifically for deployment - see below.

## Google Sheets structure (Sheet1)

| A: Date | B: URL | C: Author | D: Title | E: Place | F: Lat | G: Lng | H: Category | I: Tags | J: Summary | K: Transcript | L: Source | M: group_id |

**M: group_id** — places with the same group_id are shown on the map as a single
pin with multiple videos. Merging is proposed by Claude Haiku (the dedup command
in Telegram → Merge/Keep buttons). See `dedup.py`. Merging deletes nothing and is
reversible (clear the group_id in the sheet).

## Supported URL formats

- `https://www.facebook.com/reel/ID`
- `https://www.instagram.com/reel/ID`
- `https://www.instagram.com/p/ID`
- `https://www.tiktok.com/@user/video/ID`
- `https://www.youtube.com/shorts/ID`
- Share links (shortened: `fb.watch`, `vm.tiktok.com`, `youtu.be`) — yt-dlp expands them automatically

## Categories (for filtering on the map)

Default (en): `swimming` · `hiking` · `food` · `culture` · `nature` · `sport` · `fun` · `hotel` · `other`

Default (cs): `koupání` · `turistika` · `jídlo` · `kultura` · `příroda` · `sport` · `zábava` · `hotel` · `jiné`

Categories are configurable through the `CATEGORIES` env variable (see `i18n.py`);
the last one in the list is the fallback. The language of the bot's replies, the
map and Gemini summaries is driven by `BOT_LANGUAGE` (`en` default / `cs`); the
audio transcript stays in the language of the video.

## Development

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate       # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env        # fill in the values
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

## Language policy

The repository is public and English is its working language.

- Write commit messages, branch names and PR text in **English**.
- Code comments, docstrings and development documentation (this file) are in **English**.
- Czech stays only where it is product data, not prose:
  - `README.cs.md` (Czech user documentation)
  - the `cs` message catalog, command names and categories in `i18n.py`
  - the `cs` Gemini prompt templates in `analyzer.py`
  - the `T_cs` map UI dictionary in `map_page.py`
  - test fixtures and assertions, since `tests/conftest.py` pins `BOT_LANGUAGE=cs`
    to exercise the Czech path

## Deployment

Three supported options, documented in the README ("Deployment" section):

**VPS (our production instance):** a general step-by-step guide (for anyone, not
just our server) — `docs/deploy-vps.md`.

1. The application lives in `/opt/fbig-bot`, Python venv, runs as a systemd
   service (`deploy/fbig-bot.service`) under the `fbigbot` user
2. Caddy as a reverse proxy (`deploy/Caddyfile`) — HTTPS from Let's Encrypt
   automatically, domain via DuckDNS
3. `HOST=127.0.0.1` in `.env` — only Caddy is exposed
4. The webhook registers itself at startup based on `PUBLIC_URL`
   (manual variant: `python main.py --set-webhook <url>`)
5. Updates: `deploy/update.sh` (git pull + dependencies + yt-dlp + restart)

The unit sets `MemoryMax`, `OOMScoreAdjust=1000` and a lower CPU/IO weight so
that under memory pressure the system always kills the bot and not the other
services on the server.

**Docker** (`Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`) — VPS/NAS/Raspberry Pi without
systemd, or when you already have your own reverse proxy.

**Railway** (`railway.toml`, `nixpacks.toml`) — the easiest one to try out, with
no HTTPS/`PUBLIC_URL` to sort out (`main.py` picks up `RAILWAY_PUBLIC_DOMAIN`
automatically). `gen_railway_env.py` generates `railway-variables.local.txt`
from a local `.env` for quick pasting into the Railway dashboard.

A public domain has to be generated in the Railway dashboard first — until it
exists `RAILWAY_PUBLIC_DOMAIN` is unset, so `_public_url()` returns `""` and no
webhook is registered. The deploy still passes its `/health` check, so this
fails silently: the bot looks healthy and never replies.

**Applies to all three:** only one instance may run at a time — whichever one
registers its webhook with Telegram last receives the traffic. When switching
between them, always genuinely stop the old instance. Clearing `PUBLIC_URL` and
restarting is enough for VPS/Docker, but not for Railway — it falls back to its
own `RAILWAY_PUBLIC_DOMAIN` and re-registers the webhook regardless; a Railway
instance has to be paused/removed directly in the dashboard.

## History

The project originally ran only on Railway. Since 2026-08-06 our production
instance runs on its own VPS (see above) because the Railway trial expired;
support for Railway as a deployment option for anyone else was kept/restored
alongside VPS and Docker.

## Future extensions

- Google My Maps integration (showing pins from Sheets)
- Filtering the map by category
- Migrating the database to Supabase + the map to Vercel — a finished design
  exists, the owner keeps it outside the repo
