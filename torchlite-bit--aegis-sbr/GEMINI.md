# Aegis_SBR — CLAUDE.md

> Project brief for Claude Code. Read this first, every session, before touching code.

## Project Overview (WHY)
**Aegis: Single Button Rotation** (repo/folder: `Aegis_SBR`, formerly "AutoRota") is a
one-button rotation-engine addon for **Turtle WoW** — a private Vanilla+ server running a
custom **1.12 client, patch 1.18.1**. It executes exactly **one primary ability per key
press** using strict single-cast priority lists, to avoid global-cooldown clipping. It
reads combat state (mana/rage/energy, procs, debuff windows) and fires the highest-priority
ability for the player's class/spec/context. Users tune priorities in an in-game config UI
(flat-dark theme, spec tab rails, per-class ability toggles) with per-profile management.

Author tag: "Mercaius & Subtilizer (Torchlite)".

## ⛔ CRITICAL RULES (read first, never violate)
1. **NEVER change rotation or ability-priority logic without explicit user approval first.**
   The existing per-class priority lists are hand-tuned. When the research in
   `docs/rotations.md` disagrees with what a module actually does, your job is to **REPORT
   the discrepancy and ask** — produce a written diff (what the code does vs. what the
   research says, with the source/confidence tag) and WAIT for the user to decide, per
   class. Do not "fix" rotations proactively, even if you're confident. Non-rotation work
   (rebrand, UI, tooling, bug fixes that don't alter priority) does not need this gate, but
   anything that changes WHICH ability fires or in WHAT ORDER does.
2. **The Phase 0 rebrand to Aegis_SBR is DONE (v0.14.0)** — folder/.toc/files renamed,
   `/sbr` primary (+ `/aegis`, legacy `/ar`), `AutoRotaDB` → `AegisDB` migration shim in
   place. Do not reintroduce the old names; keep the shim + toc backup line until the
   deprecation window closes (see `docs/roadmap.md` Phase 0).
3. Run `python3 scripts/verify.py --all` after every edit; never hand off a failing file.

## Current State / Next Task
The rebrand shipped as **v0.14.0** (pending the user's in-game verification: profile
migration, `/sbr` + `/ar`, zero load errors). The addon is **Aegis_SBR** throughout:
core global `Aegis_SBR`, UI `Aegis_SBR_UI`, layout `Aegis_SBR_Layout`, minimap
`Aegis_SBR_Minimap`, frames `Aegis_SBR_*`/`AegisUI_*`, saved variable `AegisDB` (old
`AutoRotaDB` still toc-listed as a rollback backup — drop it + clear on PLAYER_LOGOUT a
few versions from now). **The Phase 1 audit-and-report is DELIVERED (v0.14.1)**: see
`docs/audit-phase1-rotations.md` — a per-class discrepancy report (all 9 classes) with
source/confidence/action/risk per finding, plus the roadmap-pre-authorized Hunter
sting-detection fix (the only code change; no priorities touched). **Next: the user
signs off findings per class; approved items are then implemented as their own gated,
verified batches** (Critical Rule #1 still applies to every one of them).

**Logos:** the user will provide raw logo image files LATER. They need converting to TGA
(power-of-two dimensions, 32-bit, GIMP/uncompressed export — see `docs/roadmap.md` Phase 0
step 6 and `docs/architecture.md`). The header stub is already wired: it tries
`Interface\\AddOns\\Aegis_SBR\\logo` and falls back to the sigil + wordmark while the
file is absent (1.12 `SetTexture` returns nil for a missing file). Drop the TGA in the
addon root as `logo.tga` and do a **full relog** to see it.

All 9 class panels use a unified single-row config layout; all four healer specs have
config panels; a Shaman totem system maintains totems across every spec via SuperWoW's
`UNIT_CASTEVENT`. **Phase 2 is underway:** a shared weapon-enchant detection helper
(`Aegis_SBR:WeaponEnchant`/`WeaponEnchantId`, `GetWeaponEnchantInfo`-based, v0.15.0) backs
Shaman main-hand imbue upkeep and a Rogue poison reminder — the latter was superseded in
v0.16.0 by the **BuffUp integration** (`Aegis_SBR_BuffUp.lua`): an optional buff-watch
monitor (any class, clickable rebuff buttons) and a rogue poison Quick Bar (up to 4
presets, click-applied, never cast from the macro). Also since Phase 2 began: Warrior
Battle Shout + Demoralizing Shout upkeep (v0.15.3, audit items W1/W4), an opt-in Rogue
execute finisher and a Paladin double-heal fix (v0.16.0), and an opt-in Warrior Master
Strike (v0.16.2, Arms talent, off by default). Off-hand imbue, poison auto-apply beyond
the Quick Bar, and Shaman totem-destruction detection remain open Phase 2 items.
v1.1.0 was a docs-only cut (README overhaul + a `docs/research-classicapi.md` deep-dive);
no rotation/engine code changed in it. v1.1.3 was the first code
cut after it, folding in four merges: Rogue buff-renew slider + opt-in Cold Blood and the
`/sbr log` press log (#30), a Paladin Consecration mana-recovery opt-out + creature-type
cache (#31), the sub-level-20 +healing penalty applied to downranked Holy Light (#33), and
the Warlock filler upgrades — Drain Soul as a main filler and a configurable Dark Harvest
gap filler (#34). No priority ORDER changed in any of them. PR **#32** (a `holyLightPct`
health gate for the same Flash of Light problem) was **closed unmerged**, superseded by #33
— don't treat it as shipped; whether a slider is wanted, and which way it points, is open.
**v1.1.4 is the current release** — two approved Warrior fixes from play reports: Bloodrage
now holds while a Charge opener is pending (it flags combat, and Charge's gate is
`not inCombat`, so it was *disqualifying* Charge for the whole pull, not merely going
first), and Rend is gated on a cached `TargetIsBleedImmune()` so it stops re-firing every
press at Mechanical/Elemental mobs. No priority ORDER changed. **Open Warrior item:** a
report that Overpower is passed over for Slam/Heroic Strike — it already sits ABOVE both in
the list, so the cause is elsewhere (likeliest: the Battle Stance gate at
`Class_Warrior.lua:422` when `cfg.stanceDance` is off, or `overpowerExpiry` being zeroed at
`:423` *before* a cast that then fails — Revenge has the same bug at `:407`). Awaiting a
`/sbr log` capture; the Warrior trace already carries an `op=Y/N` field for exactly this.

## Tech Stack / Hard Constraints (WHAT — read carefully, these bite)
- **Language: Lua 5.0** (Turtle 1.12 client). Non-negotiable:
  - Use `table.getn(t)` — **NOT** `#t`.
  - Use `math.mod(a, b)` — **NOT** `a % b`.
  - `string.find` and `string.gsub` EXIST. `string.match` / `string.gmatch` **DO NOT** —
    parse with `find` + captures via `gsub`, or hand-rolled loops.
  - Available: `ipairs`, `pairs`, `pcall`, `setmetatable`, `getglobal`, `next`,
    `string.format`, `tinsert`/`tremove`, `getn`.
  - **Event handlers use the globals `event`, `arg1`, `arg2`, …** — NOT a
    `function(self, event, ...)` signature. (`this` is the frame.)
- **Single-pass loader**: each file loads top-to-bottom exactly once, in `.toc` order.
  Every local function/table must be **DEFINED BEFORE USE** within its file. This is the
  #1 source of silent load crashes. The ordering audit (below) exists to catch it.
- **Required dependency stack** (do NOT assume retail/other APIs exist) — **read
  `docs/dependencies.md` for the actual APIs/events/behaviors before writing engine code**:
  - **SuperWoW** — `CastSpellByName(name[, unit])`, `UNIT_CASTEVENT` (cast detection with
    caster GUID + spell id), `SpellInfo(id)` (id → name), unit GUIDs, combat-log owner tags.
  - **Nampower** — spell queueing / cast timing. **One GCD spell queued at a time; one
    non-GCD spell per server tick.** Maintained fork moved to gitea.com/avitasia; expanded
    Lua API (`SCRIPTS.md`) + custom events (`EVENTS.md`). Confirm the installed fork/version.
  - **SuperCleveRoidMacros** — conditional macro engine. **Requires Nampower v3.0.0+ and
    UnitXP_SP3**; reactive abilities must be on action bars for detection; 261-char macro
    limit; enemy-debuff timers need pfUI libdebuff/Cursive. (Repo is archived/stable.)
  - Target client: **Turtle WoW 1.18.1**.
- **Custom textures**: TGA, power-of-two dimensions, 32-bit (referenced WITHOUT the `.tga`
  extension in Lua paths, using double backslashes). New/renamed textures need a full
  relog to appear (not just `/reload`). Pure-code changes need only `/reload`.
- **1.12 UI quirks that have bitten us** (don't relearn the hard way):
  - CheckButton `SetCheckedTexture`/disabled-variant setters IGNORE file paths — you must
    grab the template texture OBJECT via `GetCheckedTexture`/`GetDisabledTexture` and call
    `SetTexture` on it. (`SetNormalTexture` DOES take a path.)
  - Slider thumb is a FIXED-size texture positioned by its CENTRE travelling the full
    track — a tall thumb overhangs the ends. Keep the thumb small and inset the slider
    inside a full-span groove.
- **Do NOT use**: `#`, `%`, `string.match`/`gmatch`, `C_*` namespaces, retail widget APIs,
  `SecureActionButton`/protected functions, or anything introduced after client 1.12.

## Architecture (WHAT)
- **Shared core/UI shell** + **one rotation module per class** (9 vanilla classes), each
  with a paired `*_UI.lua` config panel. See `docs/architecture.md` for the file list and
  the shared UI primitives (the `Row` layout, `BindCheck`, `SkinButton`, section cards,
  spec tab rails, the scroll system).
- **Rotation model**: on each press, the active spec's ordered priority list is evaluated;
  the first ability whose gate passes is cast, then the function returns (strict one-cast).
- **SavedVariables**: `AegisDB` after the rebrand (migrated from `AutoRotaDB` — see the
  Phase 0 migration shim in `docs/roadmap.md`).
- **Reference docs** (read the relevant one before working in that area):
  - `docs/dependencies.md` — SuperWoW / Nampower / SuperCleveRoidMacros APIs, events,
    behaviors, and gotchas. **Read before writing any casting/detection code.**
  - `docs/rotations.md` — per-class / per-spec Turtle 1.18.1 rotation priorities (the
    reference for the rotation-correctness AUDIT — see Critical Rule #1, report don't change).
  - `docs/turtle-mechanics.md` — confirmed Turtle-specific class-change facts.
  - `docs/architecture.md` — module layout, conventions, key APIs, UI primitives.
  - `docs/roadmap.md` — phased plan; the rebrand steps; what's next.
  - `docs/sources.md` — where the game/dependency knowledge comes from, which links are
    fetchable vs. paste-only, and the two update commands. **For talents, read the in-repo
    `docs/TALENTS_1_18_1.md` — do NOT try to scrape the talent calculators (they block bots).**

## Workflow (HOW — the loop, follow it every time)
1. **Run the verifier after EVERY edit**, before presenting anything:
   ```
   python3 scripts/verify.py --all
   ```
   It runs the **balance check** (bracket/string/comment balance) AND the
   **define-before-use ordering audit**. Never commit or hand off a file that fails it.
   Target a single file with `python3 scripts/verify.py Aegis_SBR.lua` while iterating.
2. **Read the actual file content before editing** — do not edit from memory of a prior
   version; the code has moved.
3. **Incremental verified batches**: make a small, coherent change; verify; then proceed.
   Roll multi-file conversions (e.g. all class panels) in small batches, not all at once.
4. **Version cut**: `1.1.0` and up is the current scheme (pre-rebrand used letter suffixes,
   e.g. `0.13.12b`; post-rebrand ran `0.14.0`–`0.16.2` before the `v1.1.0` release cut).
   Bump the version in ALL THREE canonical spots (`.toc`, the core `.lua` `ver = "..."`,
   **and the README H1** — `# Aegis: Single Button Rotation (vX.Y.Z)`) and prepend a
   `CHANGELOG.md` entry. Keep them in sync — grep to confirm no stale version strings
   remain.
5. **Preserve `.toc` load order** — reordering files can break the single-pass loader.
6. Prefer **minimal, surgical diffs**; match existing code style and naming exactly.
7. Confirm the plan with the user before large changes; the user tests in-game and reports
   back with screenshots.

## Keeping current (dependency / mechanics updates)
Source knowledge is kept in the docs, not fetched live every session — Claude Code re-checks
sources only when the user runs an update command. `docs/sources.md` lists which links are
fetchable vs. paste-only and holds the two commands:
- **Command 1 (dependency refresh)** — check the SuperWoW/Nampower/SuperCleveRoid changelogs
  against their last-verified dates and update `docs/dependencies.md`. Run when a mod ships a
  new version.
- **Command 2 (mechanics refresh)** — re-check the Turtle Wiki against `docs/turtle-mechanics.md`
  / `docs/rotations.md` and report a discrepancy list. Run after a Turtle patch. Rotation
  priority changes still go through the audit-and-report gate (Critical Rule #1).
When you update a doc from a source, bump that source's "last verified" date in
`docs/sources.md`. For talents, consult `docs/TALENTS_1_18_1.md`; the online
calculators block automated access.

## Definition of Done (per change)
- Passes `python3 scripts/verify.py --all` (balance + ordering).
- No forbidden Lua 5.1+/retail constructs (see Hard Constraints).
- If a texture was added/renamed: noted that a **full relog** is required.
- Version bumped + CHANGELOG entry added when cutting a version; all version spots in sync.
- Files ready for the user to pull and test in-game.

## House style
- Comments explain WHY, not what. Keep the flat-dark UI conventions and palette already in
  the code. Don't introduce new dependencies. Don't refactor unrelated code in a feature
  change. When you fix a class of bug, add a one-line note to this file so it isn't
  relearned.
- **README badge header is USER-OWNED — preserve it verbatim.** The top of `README.md`
  carries the version in the **H1** (`# Aegis: Single Button Rotation (vX.Y.Z)` — bump this
  with every version cut, per Workflow step 4) plus two shields.io badge rows the user
  curates by hand: row 1 = Discord (blurple `5865F2`) · Octo WoW 1.18.1 (**purple**
  `8A2BE2`) · Capy WoW 1.18.1 (**brown** `8B5A2B`); row 2 = SuperWoW / Nampower / UnitXP_SP3
  (**Required**, **red** `C41E3A`) then ClassicAPI / SCRM (**Recommended**, **orange**
  `ff8c00`), all `style=flat-square&labelColor=555`. Do NOT add classes/license badges back,
  and do not reorder or re-colour the rows without being asked. Keep the Requirements
  table's Required/Recommended split in step with row 2.
- **Lessons already learned (don't relearn):**
  - `verify.py`'s ordering audit only flags a local defined past the calling body's END —
    a function's own inner locals (incl. closure captures) are legal, don't "fix" them
    (fixed 0.14.0; three historical false positives were exactly this).
  - When scripting bulk renames, run mechanical sweeps BEFORE inserting text that
    intentionally mentions the old name (migration shims, "formerly X" notes, legacy-alias
    comments) — or the sweep eats your own insert.
  - `verify.py`'s forward-reference check used `\b<name>\s*\(`, and `\b` matches between a
    dot and a letter — so `string.sub(` read as a call to a local named `sub`. Fixed in
    v1.1.6 with a `(?<![.:\w])` lookbehind. If a local ever shares a name with a stdlib
    function and the audit complains, check this before "fixing" the Lua.
  - An on/off command argument must be parsed with `Aegis_SBR:ToggleArg` (core), NOT
    `(arg or "") == "on"` — that idiom sends every unrecognised argument, the empty one
    included, to `false`, so a bare command silently disables what it was meant to toggle
    (fixed v1.1.5 in three places). Test its result with `== nil`; `false` is a valid return.
