# CLAUDE.md — kunnus-scanner project notes

## Project context

This is the v2 rewrite. The v1 fork (`../kunnus-scanner/`) is osv-scanner with a
`cmd/kunnus/` subcommand bolted on; ~300 files of inherited surface for ~2000 LoC
of actual kunnus logic, plus flaky tests for features we never ship.

v2 depends on **osv-scalibr** directly. We bring our own CLI shell and SBOM
encoder; the scanner library does the extraction work.

## Architectural rules — enforced in code review

1. **Host introspection lives in `internal/detect/`. Target introspection lives
   next to its plugin mapping.** `detect/` answers *where am I running?* and
   stays scalibr-free. Detecting what's at the scan root belongs in the
   registry package that owns the corresponding scalibr plugin names —
   `internal/ecosystem/` for language ecosystems, `internal/osfamily/` for
   Linux distros — so that detection metadata and plugin selection cannot
   drift apart.
2. `internal/scan/` is the **only** package that calls a scalibr scan —
   `scalibr.New().Scan()` (filesystem) and `.ScanContainer()` (container image).
   Every other package operates on `scan.Result` instead.
3. `internal/command/` is the **only** package that imports `urfave/cli/v3`.
   Modes don't know they're being invoked from a CLI.
4. Each `internal/mode/<x>/` package builds a `*scalibr.ScanConfig` from a path
   plus `mode.Overrides`. Its only I/O is calls into `detect`, `ecosystem`, or
   `osfamily` — no raw filesystem reads of its own.
5. **Every scan flavour is a `mode.Mode`; the runner dispatches on the plan.**
   `internal/mode/container/` implements `mode.Mode` like repo and os — its
   `Plan` just takes an image reference instead of a filesystem path, opens the
   image (pulling it for a remote reference), and builds the union of every
   ecosystem and Linux OS-family plugin filtered to Linux capabilities. It
   signals a container scan by setting `Plan.Image`; the shared `runScan` calls
   `scan.RunContainer` when `Plan.Image` is non-nil and `scan.Run` otherwise, so
   all three subcommands are the same `runScan(ctx, cmd, mode, target, ov)`
   one-liner and `internal/scan` stays free of mode types (the dispatch lives in
   `command`, which may know both). Plugin selection skips detection: the union
   is enabled and scalibr's per-extractor `FileRequired` decides what the image
   matches.
   Digests that are only knowable after the scan ride on `Plan.PostScanHashes`,
   a hook the runner invokes with the resulting inventory and merges into
   `Plan.Hashes` — for modes (like container) whose digests key off the scanned
   packages rather than being harvestable during planning.

## Licence pipeline

Licence handling is spread across several packages on purpose; the map of the
whole flow lives in `internal/license/doc.go` (read that first). The short
version:

- **Six sources** feed a component's licence: apk/rpm (scalibr, free),
  deps.dev (opt-in online enricher), per-package manifests of installed packages
  (npm/python/java/lua/ruby), Debian/Ubuntu copyright files, composer.lock, and
  the offline full-text classifier (`license.Classify`, google/licensecheck) as
  a probabilistic fallback when structured parsing yields nothing.
- **Two paths** carry them, chosen by cardinality + timing: *enrichers* mutate
  `pkg.Licenses` post-scan, one package at a time (and are the **only** path that
  works for container scans, which never call `ecosystem.Survey`); the *map path*
  (`license.Map`) mines a lockfile once during the planning walk and rides
  through `mode.Plan` into `sbom.Encode` (repo-mode only). `license.Map` mirrors
  `hashes.Map` because both are mined in the same Survey pass.
- **One merge:** `sbom.injectLicensesCDX` unions both paths and normalizes every
  value through `license.Normalize`.
- **Parsing asymmetry is intentional:** `manifestlicense` delegates to
  `ecosystem` (five formats, each keyed by its scalibr extractor); `debiancopyright`
  parses inline (one format, no ecosystem home). Same rule — parsing lives with
  the domain that owns the format, registry only when N > 1.

## Binary classifier (non-packaged software)

`internal/binclass/` surfaces software compiled into an image as a bare
executable — no apk/dpkg/rpm record, and no embedded manifest for scalibr's
`gobinary`/`cargoauditable`/`dotnetpe` extractors to read (e.g. a hand-built
memcached daemon). It is a scalibr `filesystem.Extractor`: a filename glob
selects candidate files, an ELF-magic check rejects non-binaries, and a version
regex scanned over the file's bytes yields a `pkg:generic` (or
`pkg:golang`/`pkg:github`) package. A second matcher mode (`nameTemplate`) reads
a major.minor hint from the filename and renders it into the content regex —
this is how python is caught (the `libpython*.so*` and `python*` globs, version
read from the NUL-delimited bytes). The catalog (`catalog.go`) is ported from
anchore/syft's binary cataloger (Apache-2.0); `doc.go` records what was left out
— syft's resolver-based shared-library lookup and its Java JDK/JRE branching set.
CPE templates are carried on each classifier as data; the `sbom` CPE stage
renders the detected version into them (first template → the component's `cpe`,
further vendor aliases → repeated `kunnus:cpe` properties) in preference to its
PURL heuristic. The classifier also records the SHA-256 of each classified
file (the bytes are in memory anyway) on `binclass.Metadata`;
`sbom.injectClassifierHashesCDX` surfaces it as `component.hashes[]` — the
CISA Component Hash for exactly the binaries no package manager vouches for.
A file that hit the `maxScanBytes` cap gets no digest (hashing a prefix would
be wrong) and keeps its explicit unknown-hash marker.

It is a kunnus extractor, not a scalibr-registry plugin, so `mode/os` and
`mode/container` append `binclass.New()` directly to their plugin lists (it is
**not** added to `mode/repo`: source trees rarely carry compiled server
binaries). The ELF gate makes it a no-op on the Windows/Mac OS targets.

**Overlap suppression** (`sbom.suppressOSManagedBinaries`, an encode stage run
right after dedup, before enrichment/CPEs/dep-graph). The classifier keys on
filename + bytes, so a binary an OS package manager also tracks (`/bin/bash`
owned by the bash `.deb`) would otherwise appear twice — once as `pkg:deb/...`
and once as `pkg:generic/...`. The stage drops the `pkg:generic` twin when
either signal fires:

- **File ownership (primary).** `internal/ownership/` reads the dpkg
  (`var/lib/dpkg/info/*.list`), apk (`lib/apk/db/installed`), rpm
  (`var/lib/rpm/rpmdb.sqlite` etc., via go-rpmdb) and chisel
  (`var/lib/chisel/manifest.wall`, a zstd jsonwall) databases at the scan root into
  a set of owned paths, carried on `Plan.OwnedFiles` (built by `mode/os` and
  `mode/container`, which have the root/image FS) and passed into `sbom.Encode`.
  A generic component is dropped when one of its evidence locations is an owned
  file. Because this keys on **path, not name**, it bridges the common case where
  the owning package's name differs from the binary's — `/usr/bin/xz` owned by
  `xz-utils`, `…/bin/postgres` owned by `postgresql-18`, `/usr/bin/curl` owned by
  `curl-minimal`. (The rpm reader materialises the binary DB to a temp file,
  since go-rpmdb's sqlite/BerkeleyDB drivers open by path, not via `fs.FS`.)
- **Name + version (fallback).** A deb/apk/rpm component shares the generic
  component's name and a version that *covers* it — equal, or the binary's
  upstream version followed by a packaging separator, so `5.2.37-2+b9` covers
  `5.2.37` but `1.130` does not cover `1.13`. This backstops the cases ownership
  misses (no DB readable, or a merged-usr `/bin`↔`/usr/bin` path mismatch).

Only `pkg:generic` is ever suppressed (the `pkg:golang`/`pkg:github` catalog
entries are left alone), and the authoritative OS package (with its distro
version, supplier and licence) is the one kept. A genuinely non-packaged binary
— memcached or redis compiled from source — is owned by nothing and matches no
package name, so it survives.

## Declared ranges vs resolved pins (manifest/lockfile double-counting)

Three ecosystems ship both a manifest extractor and a lockfile extractor that
read the *same* dependency: the manifest gives the declared constraint as the
version, the lockfile the resolved pin. The PURLs differ, so dedup cannot
collapse them, and the component is counted twice — the second one at a version
that was never released, carrying a CPE that matches no advisory
(`pkg:nuget/Serilog@%5B3.0.0%2C4.0.0%29`). The resolved pin is authoritative
(it is what builds, and it carries the lockfile's checksum), so the declared
twin goes.

Which mechanism applies is decided by **how far the lockfile's authority
reaches** — not by preference:

| Ecosystem | Manifest → lock | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| cargo | `Cargo.toml` → `Cargo.lock` | plan time: `rust/cargotoml` never enabled |
| dotnet | `*.csproj`/`*.vbproj`/`*.fsproj`, `Directory.{Packages,Build}.props` → `packages.lock.json` | post scan, per path |
| python | `*requirements*.txt` → `uv.lock`, `poetry.lock`, `pdm.lock`, `Pipfile.lock` | post scan, per path |

- **Plan time** (`ecosystem.Ecosystem.Supersedes`, evaluated in `Survey`'s single
  walk, subtracted in `mode/repo` *before* `ApplyOverrides` so `--enable
  rust/cargotoml` still wins). A `Cargo.lock` resolves its whole workspace, so
  one lock speaks for every `Cargo.toml` below it and a whole-scan switch is
  exact. The extractor never runs: no wasted pass, no phantom component to clean
  up. The rule fires only when **every** manifest found is covered by a lock at
  or above it — in a monorepo where one crate is locked and another is not, it
  stays quiet and the unlocked crate keeps its declared ranges. Losing a
  component is worse than listing one twice.
- **Post scan** (`sbom.suppressResolvedDeclarations`, an encode stage beside
  `suppressOSManagedBinaries` — after dedup, before CPEs and the dep graph). A
  `packages.lock.json` is opt-in *per project* and a python lock speaks for the
  project it sits in, so a whole-scan switch would silence manifests no resolver
  ever saw. This drops a declared component only when both signals agree, the
  same two-signal shape as the binary-classifier overlap stage: **path** (every
  evidence location is a manifest in or below a directory holding one of that
  ecosystem's lockfiles) and **name** (a component extracted from such a
  lockfile pins the same name, under that ecosystem's name equivalence —
  case-insensitive for nuget, PEP 503 separator folding for pypi). So an
  unlocked project keeps its declarations, `docs/requirements.txt` keeps the
  sphinx its project's lock does not resolve, and a conditional dependency the
  resolver never saw survives with its range and its unknown-info markers.

The other 20 ecosystems were audited and need nothing: their manifest-side
extractor reports *installed state* rather than declared ranges
(`javascript/packagejson` — dependency parsing is off by default;
`ruby/gemspec`; `lua/luarocks`; `java/archive`), or the manifest has no
extractor at all (`composer.json`, `Gemfile`, `build.gradle`, `conanfile.txt`),
or the only file is itself a freeze/lock (`haskell`, `swift`, `r`, `gradle`).
`java/pomxml` does emit declared ranges but Maven has no lockfile to supersede
it. The embedded native extractors (espidf) already prefer the lock internally.

Known gap: a mixed monorepo (one project locked, one not) keeps the phantoms for
the *locked* cargo crates — the plan-time rule declines to fire rather than lose
the unlocked crate's data. Moving cargo onto the post-scan stage would fix that
at the cost of running an extractor whose output is thrown away.

## ModusToolbox ecosystem (native extractor, no scalibr plugin)

Infineon ModusToolbox firmware (PSE84 / Cortex-M projects) declares each
dependency in a one-line `*.mtb` manifest:
`https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>[.git]#<git-ref>#<storage-location>`. The
owner/repo become a `pkg:github` component and the git ref its version, kept
verbatim (refs are tags like `release-v6.1.0`, `STABLE-2_1_2_RELEASE`,
`v2.86.1` — not semver). The third field is ModusToolbox bookkeeping; ignored.
`assetlocks.json` is not parsed: it carries no repository URL, so it cannot form
a PURL, and it is redundant with the `.mtb` files.

scalibr has no ModusToolbox extractor, so `internal/modustoolbox/` is a
kunnus-native `filesystem.Extractor` (the binclass pattern). It is wired in
**only for repo scans** — `.mtb` files describe a source tree's declared
dependencies, not installed state — via a new mechanism that keeps detection and
plugin selection from drifting (architecture rule #1):

- `internal/ecosystem/` carries a `modustoolbox` entry that detects the `.mtb`
  suffix and sets the new **`NativeExtractor`** flag instead of `ScalibrPlugins`
  (the completeness invariant accepts either). The entry names no extractor
  instance, so `ecosystem` stays free of scalibr APIs.
- `mode/repo` maps the detected `"modustoolbox"` ecosystem to
  `modustoolbox.New()` and appends it to the plan's plugins (and counts it in the
  "something to ship" guard), exactly as `mode/os` appends `binclass.New()`.

No hashes or licences: a `.mtb` pins a git tag, not a commit SHA or checksum, and
carries no licence data; resolving either needs network access the scanner
forbids. The cross-project duplication (the same lib pinned by three
sub-projects) collapses in the sbom dedup stage.

## Embedded C/C++ ecosystems (native extractors, no scalibr plugins)

CRA pushes SBOM coverage into embedded firmware, so kunnus carries native
extractors (the modustoolbox pattern: `NativeExtractor` registry entry +
`internal/<name>/` extractor + a branch in `mode/repo`'s
`nativeExtractorsFor`) for ecosystems scalibr does not cover. Conan needs
nothing here — the `cpp` ecosystem already runs scalibr's `cpp/conanlock`.

- **vcpkg** (`internal/vcpkg/`): parses manifest-mode `vcpkg.json`. Each
  `dependencies[]` entry (bare string or object) becomes a `pkg:vcpkg`
  component (the purl spec has a vcpkg type; its `port_version` /
  `repository_url` / `triplet` qualifiers are not emitted — scalibr's generic
  purl conversion carries only type, name and version). Version resolution is
  the best offline data, in order: an
  `overrides[]` pin, else the dep's own `version>=` floor (with the `#N`
  port-version suffix stripped — that's vcpkg packaging metadata), else
  versionless. `builtin-baseline` is deliberately ignored: resolving the
  baseline commit to concrete port versions requires the vcpkg registry, i.e.
  network access the scanner forbids. Feature-conditional dependencies
  (`features.<x>.dependencies`) are not walked — whether a feature is enabled
  is unknowable from the manifest alone.

- **git submodules** (`internal/gitsubmodule/`): parses `.gitmodules` stanzas
  (via go-git's config decoder) for each submodule's path and remote URL —
  github.com remotes (https/ssh/scp-like) become `pkg:github/<owner>/<repo>`,
  everything else `pkg:generic/<last-path-segment>`. The pinned commit is not
  in the manifest: it is the gitlink entry in the superproject's `.git/index`,
  which the extractor decodes (go-git's index format reader) through the scan
  FS — no submodule checkout and no `git` subprocess needed. An exported tree
  without `.git` yields versionless components. scalibr's `misc/gitrepo` does
  walk submodules too, but was rejected deliberately: it triggers on `.git`
  directories (which `fswalk` skips on every kunnus walk) and needs
  `DirectFS`/`ExtractFromDirs` capabilities repo mode doesn't grant, it emits
  the scanned repo itself as a package, its GitHub names drop the owner
  namespace (`pkg:github/fmt`, not `pkg:github/fmtlib/fmt`), and it yields
  nothing on an exported tree with no `.git`.

- **PlatformIO** (`internal/platformio/`): parses `lib_deps` options across
  every section of `platformio.ini` (single-line and indented-continuation
  forms). Registry specs (`name`, `owner/name`, optionally `@ <version>` with
  spaces allowed) become `pkg:generic` with the version or range kept verbatim
  (the modustoolbox rule: a declared range is the truth; resolving it needs
  PlatformIO's registry, i.e. network). Source URLs with `#<ref>` become
  `pkg:github` for github.com, `pkg:generic` otherwise; `file://`/`symlink://`
  paths and `${...}` interpolations are dropped (interpolation would need
  configparser semantics for marginal gain). Duplicate declarations across
  `[env:*]` sections collapse in the SBOM dedup stage.

- **ESP-IDF** (`internal/espidf/`): two component-manager files, lock
  preferred. `dependencies.lock` pins exact versions for the whole project
  (direct + transitive, including the `idf` framework pseudo-component) →
  `pkg:generic/<namespace>/<name>@<version>`; when a manifest
  (`idf_component.yml`) sits under a locked project (checked by walking up to
  the scan root), it is skipped entirely — emitting its ranges alongside the
  lock's pins would duplicate every component under two purls. Manifest-only
  projects fall back to declared constraints verbatim (`*` → versionless, bare
  names get the `espressif/` registry namespace, `path:` components dropped,
  `git:` sources classified by host). The lock's SHA-256 `component_hash`
  rides the standard `HashParsers` → `hashes.Map` path (the entry lives in
  `internal/ecosystem/espidf.go`), keyed by the same purls the extractor
  emits.

- **Zephyr / west** (`internal/zephyr/`): parses `west.yml` (also `west.yaml`)
  and resolves each `manifest.projects[]` entry per west's rules — explicit
  `url` wins, else the project's remote (falling back to `defaults.remote`, or
  the sole remote when only one exists) contributes `url-base` joined with
  `repo-path` or the name; `revision` falls back to `defaults.revision`, else
  versionless (west's own fallback is a moving branch head — not a pin worth
  recording). github.com → `pkg:github/<owner>/<repo>@<revision>` (revision
  verbatim: tags and SHAs both appear), else `pkg:generic/<project-name>`.
  `manifest.self` is the scanned tree itself, never a component. Manifest
  `import:` resolution (pulling further manifests from other repos) needs
  those repos on disk and is deliberately out of scope.

- **CMake declares** (`internal/cmake/` + `internal/cmakedecl/`): surfaces
  dependencies pinned directly in CMake source — `FetchContent_Declare` /
  `ExternalProject_Add` (git URL + `GIT_TAG`, or tarball `URL` + `URL_HASH`)
  and CPM.cmake (`CPMAddPackage`/`CPMFindPackage`, shorthand and keyword
  forms). This is **not** a CMake interpreter: a command-invocation scanner
  reads literal arguments, and any identity field containing `${...}` drops
  the declare — the correctness rule (we cannot evaluate variables) doubles as
  the false-positive control. The vendored `CPM.cmake` script is rejected by
  filename. The grammar lives in `internal/cmakedecl` (scalibr-free) because
  two consumers must derive identical purls: the `internal/cmake` extractor
  and the ecosystem registry's `URL_HASH` HashParser (SHA-256/512/SHA-1/MD5
  digests on tarball declares → the standard hashes.Map path). Detection flags
  `cmake` on essentially every C++ repo; that is harmless — no declares, no
  components. Known gap: the hash-parser dispatch is exact-filename, so
  URL_HASH mining runs for `CMakeLists.txt` but not `*.cmake` modules.

- **Arduino** (`internal/arduino/`): two component sources. Each vendored
  library's `library.properties` describes the library it sits in (name +
  version, .gemspec-style installed state) → one `pkg:generic` component.
  arduino-cli's `sketch.yaml`/`sketch.yml` profiles pin libraries and platform
  cores in the `Name (version)` form → `pkg:generic` per pin; the platform
  core (`vendor:arch`, colon kept verbatim in the purl name) is a real
  dependency — the vendor's framework compiled into the firmware. A library's
  `depends=` field is deliberately not emitted: those transitive declarations
  usually duplicate libraries vendored (and surfaced) right next to it,
  without pins of their own.

- **CMSIS-Solution** (`internal/cmsis/`): parses `solution.packs` from
  `*.csolution.yml`/`.yaml` (Open-CMSIS-Pack / Keil MDK / vendor toolchains).
  Each `Vendor::Pack[@constraint]` spec → `pkg:generic/<Vendor>/<Pack>` with
  the constraint verbatim (exact, `^range`, `>=floor` — resolving needs the
  pack index, i.e. network). Local `path:` packs are in-development code and
  wildcard selections (`NXP::*`) name no single component; both dropped.
  `*.cproject.yml`/`*.clayer.yml` are not markers: packs are solution-level in
  the csolution spec.

## Linux kernel (host-only, fallback-only OS family)

For `sbom os` over a full host, VM image, or extracted firmware root, the
kernel itself is CRA-relevant software. The `kernel` entry in
`internal/osfamily/` wires scalibr's `os/kernel/module` (every `*.ko`, version
from the ELF `.modinfo` section) and `os/kernel/vmlinuz` (`boot/vmlinuz*`
images) with two deliberate restrictions:

- **Fallback-only** (no detection fingerprint): the extractors run when no
  distro is detected at the scan root — the extracted-firmware case, where a
  kernel is present but no package database is. On a *detected* distro they are
  opt-in via `--enable-plugins os/kernel/module,os/kernel/vmlinuz`, because a
  full host yields one component per module (hundreds) and that is not the
  default SBOM character for "scan this Ubuntu root".
- **Host-only** (`LinuxFamily.HostOnly`): container images have no kernel, so
  `mode/container` builds its union from `osfamily.ContainerLinuxPlugins()`,
  which excludes host-only families; `AllLinuxPlugins()` (the host-scan
  fallback) keeps them.

Known wart: scalibr's kernel extractors set no `PURLType`. For *modules*,
`scan.backfillKernelModulePURLs` (run on every scan result) fills in
`pkg:generic`, so each module carries a machine identifier (CISA Component
Identifiers) — `pkg:generic/intel_oaktrail@0.4ac1` — and flows through the
purl-keyed sbom stages like any other component; the fill only touches empty
types, so it becomes a no-op if upstream ever stamps its own. Modules are
excluded from the CPE stage's PURL heuristic (`isKernelModule`): an in-tree
module has no NVD identity, so inventing `a:<module>:<module>` would be
wrong. The kernel *image* stays purl-less ("Linux Kernel" makes a poor purl
name) and lands as a name/version component. It does get a CPE despite the
missing purl: `injectCPEsCDX` recognises the vmlinuz metadata and synthesises
the NVD dictionary form `cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:<upstream release>`,
truncating a distro suffix ("6.8.0-49-generic" → "6.8.0") because NVD keys
kernel CVEs on the upstream release (verified: 5,779 CVEs against 6.8.0).
Modules get no CPE — an in-tree module has no NVD identity of its own. Note
the distro caveat: a heavily-backported distro kernel matched against upstream
ranges over-reports; the honest match for those is the distro ecosystem via
the dpkg-provided `linux-image-*` package, which a full-host scan surfaces
anyway. The upstream CPE is exactly right for the family's main case, vanilla
BSP/firmware kernels.

`os/spack` (HPC package manager) was also audited and deliberately skipped —
supercomputing installs are out of target profile (#68).

## Serial numbers & document series

`internal/sbom/serial.go` (user docs: `docs/serial-numbers.md`). Rescans of
one component share a deterministic `serialNumber` — UUIDv8 =
SHA-256(namespace, `"v1"␟mode␟id␟version`), namespace = UUIDv5(DNS,
kunnus.tech), pinned by test — with the document `version` set to the
generation timestamp in epoch seconds so series members stay strictly ordered
without scanner state (the platform owns pretty revision numbers, at ingest).
The identity is never invented: `--component-id`/`--component-version` flags
(`bom.Series`, built in `command/runScan` from the *final* component values so
key and root component can't disagree), or container mode's mode-native
identity (registry repo path + tag via `seriesIdentity`; tarballs get none).
No identity → random serial, version 1, honest series-of-one. `--serial-number`
overrides derivation entirely and is validated (`sbom.NormalizeSerial`) before
the scan runs. Mode is part of the key: repo and os SBOMs of one component are
different series. The scheme prefix, separator, and namespace must never
change — each would silently split (or merge) every existing series.

## Generation context (CycloneDX lifecycles)

Each mode declares its CISA generation context on `Plan.Lifecycle`
(`bom.Lifecycle`): repo → `pre-build` (reads source), os and container →
`post-build` (analyse built artifacts). `sbom` writes it to
`metadata.lifecycles` verbatim and stays mode-agnostic; empty omits the field.

## SBOM author (CISA SBOM Author element)

The author is the entity *operating* the scanner, not the tool (CISA is
explicit about the distinction). `--author "Name <email>"` / `KUNNUS_AUTHOR`
(parsed by `command.parseAuthor`, validated before the scan) rides through
`bom.Author` into `sbom.enrichCDXMetadata`, which writes it to
`metadata.authors` and `metadata.manufacturer` (CycloneDX 1.6: the org that
created the BOM). Unset, both keep the kunnus creator identity so BSI
`sbom_creator` stays satisfied out of the box — correct when think-ahead
operates the scan, a placeholder otherwise, so `runScan` warns when the flag
is missing (making it required is a candidate for the next major version).
Kunnus and SCALIBR are always recorded in `metadata.tools.components`
regardless.

## Dependency graph (CISA Component Dependency Relationship)

`sbom.injectDepGraphCDX` emits `dependencies[]` (root → every component as
the presence claim; every component gets an entry) plus a `compositions[]`
`aggregate: incomplete` declaration — CycloneDX's native known-unknowns
statement for graph completeness. Real component→component edges come from
`graph.Map` (purl → dependsOn purls, both ends conventional form), mined in
the same `ecosystem.Survey` pass as hashes and licences via the registry's
`GraphParsers` hook. An edge whose target purl matches no component is
dropped — no parser and no stage ever invents a ref, so a requirement the
lockfile leaves unresolved simply produces no edge. Repo-mode only, like
every Survey product; the aggregate stays `incomplete` because only the
mined formats have real edges.

Six formats are mined, each with its own resolution rule:

| Lockfile | Edge source → target resolution |
|---|---|
| `Cargo.lock` | per-package `dependencies` list, three entry shapes (`name`, `name version`, `name version (source)`); a bare name matching several locked versions is dropped, never guessed |
| `composer.lock` | `require` keys resolved against the lock's own packages, so platform deps (`php`, `ext-*`, `composer-plugin-api`) drop out without a denylist |
| `Gemfile.lock` | every 4-space `specs:` entry owns the 6-space requirement lines under it (GEM/PATH/GIT alike); constraints ignored — the lock pins one version per gem. Platform suffixes are stripped from the spec version, matching scalibr's purl |
| `package-lock.json` (+`npm-shrinkwrap.json`) | node's own walk-up over the v2/v3 path-keyed `packages` map, so a nested copy beats the hoisted one. The `""` entry is the scanned project, never an edge source. v1 lockfiles (npm 6) are not parsed — their nesting semantics must be inferred, and no edges beats wrong edges |
| `packages.lock.json` | each entry's `dependencies` map resolved to the *resolved* version within the **same target framework** (one id can resolve differently per framework); ids matched case-insensitively, as NuGet treats them |
| `renv.lock` | `Requirements` names resolved against the lock's own `Packages`, so unpinned base/recommended R packages (and the `R` entry) drop out |

Formats audited and found to carry **no** inter-component edges — flat pin
lists or unresolved direct-only declarations, so a parser would have nothing
to mine: `conan.lock`, `gradle.lockfile`, `Package.resolved`, `go.mod`/`go.sum`,
`pom.xml`, `requirements.txt`, `cabal.project.freeze`, `stack.yaml.lock`, and
the embedded-firmware manifests. Known follow-ups that *do* pin graphs but
have no in-tree fixture yet: `poetry.lock`, `uv.lock`, `Pipfile.lock`,
`Podfile.lock`.

## Unknown-information markers (CISA practice)

`sbom.markUnknownInfoCDX` (`internal/sbom/unknown.go`) is the **last** encode
stage: it sweeps the final component list and stamps `kunnus:unknown:producer`
/ `version` / `hash` / `license` properties (documented in
`docs/sbom-properties.md`) wherever a field is still absent, so omission is a
statement, not an accident. Last is load-bearing ([enforced]): every stage
that can still fill one of those fields must have run. The root component is
exempt — its identity is the operator's own statement via flags. kunnus never
withholds data, so a marker always means unknown, never redacted.

## Things we deliberately did NOT build

- Plugin registry / factory pattern — two modes don't justify it.
- Config file support — flags only. Add YAML later if customers ask.
- DI container — package-level functions are fine.
- Vulnerability matching — out of scope; that's the platform's job.

## Known limitations

- **Java groupId from bare JARs.** A JAR without `META-INF/maven/.../pom.properties`
  (common for OSGi/shaded bundles) carries no authoritative Maven groupId.
  scalibr's `javaarchive` then falls back to the `Bundle-SymbolicName` or
  filename, which is often a single segment (e.g. `bcpg` for `bcpg-jdk18on`
  instead of `org.bouncycastle`). Since OSV's Maven ecosystem keys on
  `groupId:artifactId`, the wrong groupId silently drops vuln matches. This is
  upstream extractor data we don't own — tracked at
  https://github.com/google/osv-scalibr/issues/840 (expand the artifactId→groupId
  map toward Syft parity). We deliberately do NOT ship our own groupId database
  or a Maven Central lookup: the former is a maintenance liability, the latter
  contradicts the no-network design. JARs that do embed `pom.properties` get the
  correct groupId.

- **Binary classifier is a simplified syft port.** `internal/binclass/` carries
  syft's direct file-contents regexes plus a filename-template matcher (which
  covers python); not ported are syft's resolver-based shared-library lookup and
  the Java JDK/JRE branching set.
  Overlap suppression is path-based via `internal/ownership/` (with a
  name+version fallback) across dpkg, apk, rpm and chisel, so it correctly collapses
  packages whose name differs from the binary's (`xz-utils`, `postgresql-18`,
  `curl-minimal`).

## Testing

TDD throughout. **No mocks** — real fixtures and real I/O at every boundary.
Coverage is layered, with the slow/broad tests built on the same fixtures as
the fast/narrow ones:

- **Unit + registry invariants.** `ecosystem` and `osfamily` each carry drift
  guards: parser filenames must be detectable, names unique, etc. `binclass`
  carries its own catalog drift guard (every classifier has a glob, a `version`
  capture group, and a well-formed PURL/CPE) and proves extraction + the ELF
  gate against a real slice of the `memcached:latest` binary, and the
  filename-template matcher against a real slice of `python:latest`'s
  `libpython3.14.so`. `ownership` parses
  real dpkg `.list` and apk `installed` fixtures and tolerates a corrupt rpm DB
  (a valid rpmdb is a binary sqlite/bdb blob, so the rpm parse path is verified
  e2e against a real rpm image, not an in-tree fixture — see the rpm note below);
  the `sbom` overlap stage is tested for both the path-ownership and name+version
  drop signals. The declared-range stage is tested per ecosystem for the mixed
  cases that must survive it (an unlocked sibling project, a docs requirements
  file the lock does not resolve), and the plan-time half by asserting the
  selected plugin names in `mode/repo`. Hash parsers,
  `detect`, `sbom` stages (cpe/supplier/dedup/depgraph/properties/overlap/declared/encode),
  and `upload` (via `httptest`) are tested in isolation.
- **Shared fixture corpus at the module root.** `testdata/ecosystems/<name>/`
  and `testdata/osfamilies/<name>/` each hold a real manifest/lockfile (or
  package DB + `etc/os-release`) plus a `want.txt` listing the exact `purl` and
  `cpe` the scanner must emit (or `pkg <name>@<version>` for packages that
  carry no purl, like the kernel extractors' output). Both the scan-seam tier
  and the binary e2e tier read this one corpus. The `kernel` fixture is real
  binaries from scalibr's own testdata (Apache-2.0): a full `.ko` and a 32 KiB
  slice of a vmlinuz image, exercising the no-distro fallback path.
- **Scan-seam integration** (`internal/scan/*_integration_test.go`). For each
  registered ecosystem / Linux OS family, plan via `mode/repo` or `mode/os`,
  run real scalibr, and assert the exact purls appear in the inventory. The
  loops over `ecosystem.All()` / `osfamily.LinuxFamilies()` are anti-drift
  guards: a new registry entry without a fixture (or a documented reason in
  `osFamiliesWithoutFixture`) turns the suite red. Container scanning is proven
  here against a synthetic multi-layer image built in-memory with
  `go-containerregistry`, asserting per-layer attribution.
- **Binary e2e** (`cmd/kunnus/*_test.go`). Build the real binary once, then
  drive subcommands with real flags: a kitchen-sink `sbom repo` over every
  ecosystem at once, `sbom os --target-os linux` per family, and `sbom
  container` over a synthetic image tarball — each asserting purls **and** cpes
  in the CycloneDX output (plus layer properties for containers).

Not in-tree fixturable, by design: rpm-based OS families (binary sqlite/bdb
DB), `cos` (image-specific), and the registry-pull / local-docker container
sources (need a network registry or a docker daemon). These are documented
skips, not coverage gaps.
