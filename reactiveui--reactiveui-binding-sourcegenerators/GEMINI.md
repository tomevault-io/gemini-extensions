# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Zero Tolerance Policy

- **NEVER abandon work halfway through** - if something gets difficult, push through it
- **NEVER use `git stash`** to hide incomplete work - fix the problem directly
- **NEVER give up because a task is complex** - break it down and keep going
- If a tool call is rejected, adapt your approach immediately and continue

## Build & Test Commands

This project uses **Microsoft Testing Platform (MTP)** with the **TUnit** testing framework. Test commands differ significantly from traditional VSTest.

See: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-test?tabs=dotnet-test-with-mtp

### Prerequisites

```powershell
# Check .NET installation (.NET 8.0, 9.0, and 10.0 required)
dotnet --info

# Restore NuGet packages
cd src
dotnet restore ReactiveUI.Binding.SourceGenerators.slnx
```

**Note:** This project uses the modern `.slnx` (XML-based solution file) format instead of the legacy `.sln` format.

### Build Commands

**CRITICAL:** The working folder must be `./src` folder. These commands won't function properly without the correct working folder.

```powershell
# Build the solution
dotnet build ReactiveUI.Binding.SourceGenerators.slnx -c Release

# Build with warnings as errors (includes StyleCop violations)
dotnet build ReactiveUI.Binding.SourceGenerators.slnx -c Release -warnaserror

# Clean the solution
dotnet clean ReactiveUI.Binding.SourceGenerators.slnx
```

### Test Commands (Microsoft Testing Platform)

**CRITICAL:** This repository uses MTP configured in `testconfig.json`. All TUnit-specific arguments must be passed after `--`:

The working folder must be `./src` folder.

**IMPORTANT:**
- Do NOT use `--no-build` flag when running tests. Always build before testing to ensure all code changes are compiled.
- Use `--output Detailed` to see Console.WriteLine output from tests (place BEFORE any `--` separator).

```powershell
# Run all tests in the solution
dotnet test --solution ReactiveUI.Binding.SourceGenerators.slnx -c Release

# Run all tests in a specific project
dotnet test --project tests/ReactiveUI.Binding.Analyzer.Tests/ReactiveUI.Binding.Analyzer.Tests.csproj -c Release
dotnet test --project tests/ReactiveUI.Binding.SourceGenerators.Tests/ReactiveUI.Binding.SourceGenerators.Tests.csproj -c Release
dotnet test --project tests/ReactiveUI.Binding.Tests/ReactiveUI.Binding.Tests.csproj -c Release

# Run a single test method using treenode-filter
dotnet test --project tests/ReactiveUI.Binding.SourceGenerators.Tests/ReactiveUI.Binding.SourceGenerators.Tests.csproj -- --treenode-filter "/*/*/*/MyTestMethod"

# Run all tests in a specific class
dotnet test --project tests/ReactiveUI.Binding.SourceGenerators.Tests/ReactiveUI.Binding.SourceGenerators.Tests.csproj -- --treenode-filter "/*/*/WhenChangedGeneratorTests/*"

# Run tests with code coverage
dotnet test --solution ReactiveUI.Binding.SourceGenerators.slnx -- --coverage --coverage-output-format cobertura
```

### TUnit Treenode-Filter Syntax

The `--treenode-filter` follows the pattern: `/{AssemblyName}/{Namespace}/{ClassName}/{TestMethodName}`

- Single test: `--treenode-filter "/*/*/*/MyTestMethod"`
- All tests in class: `--treenode-filter "/*/*/MyClassName/*"`
- Use single asterisks (`*`) to match segments.

### Key Configuration Files

- `src/ReactiveUI.Binding.SourceGenerators.slnx` - Modern XML-based solution file
- `src/testconfig.json` - Configures test execution and code coverage
- `src/Directory.Build.props` - Common build properties, package metadata
- `src/Directory.Packages.props` - Central package management
- `src/Directory.Build.targets` - Build targets

### Snapshot Testing with Verify

- Generator tests use **Verify.SourceGenerators** for snapshot testing
- Snapshots stored as `*.verified.cs` files alongside test classes
- To accept new/changed snapshots:
  1. Enable `VerifierSettings.AutoVerify()` in `AssemblySetup.cs`
  2. Run tests to accept all snapshots
  3. Disable `VerifierSettings.AutoVerify()` after accepting
  4. Re-run tests to confirm they pass without AutoVerify

### Generator Test Language Versions (Critical)

Generator tests use a **two-tier language version** strategy to verify generated output compiles under C# 7.3 (the minimum supported version for consumer projects):

- **Default: C# 7.3** — `TestHelper.CreateCompilation()` and `RunGenerator()` default to `LanguageVersion.CSharp7_3`. This ensures generated output contains no C# 8+ syntax (no nullable reference type annotations, no `static` lambdas, no `#nullable enable`).
- **CallerArgumentExpression tests: explicit C# 10** — Tests that verify `CallerArgumentExpression`-based dispatch (the primary dispatch mechanism for C# 10+ projects) must pass `LanguageVersion.CSharp10` explicitly. These are the majority of snapshot tests.
- **CallerFilePath fallback tests: explicit C# 7.3** — Tests that verify `CallerFilePath + CallerLineNumber` dispatch (the fallback for pre-C# 10 projects) pass `LanguageVersion.CSharp7_3` explicitly to document intent, even though it matches the default.
- **Edge case tests** (`RunGenerator` without snapshot verification) — These use the C# 7.3 default. They verify the generator doesn't crash on invalid lambdas and produces no dispatch code. They don't call `CompilationSucceeds()` since their test source may contain C# 8+ features that are only diagnostically invalid under C# 7.3.
- **Runtime execution tests** — These use `LanguageVersion.CSharp10` because their inline source uses C# 8+ features and they call `CompilationSucceeds()`.

**When adding new generator tests:**
1. If the test verifies CallerArgumentExpression dispatch → pass `LanguageVersion.CSharp10`
2. If the test verifies CallerFilePath fallback dispatch → pass `LanguageVersion.CSharp7_3`
3. If the test verifies the generator skips invalid input → use the default (no parameter)
4. If the test compiles and loads the generated assembly → pass `LanguageVersion.CSharp10`

### Code Coverage

Code coverage uses **Microsoft.Testing.Extensions.CodeCoverage** configured in `src/testconfig.json`. Coverage is collected for production assemblies only (test projects and TestModels are excluded).

```powershell
# Run tests with code coverage (from src/ folder)
dotnet test --solution ReactiveUI.Binding.SourceGenerators.slnx -c Release -- --coverage --coverage-output-format cobertura

# Generate HTML report using ReportGenerator (install if needed: dotnet tool install -g dotnet-reportgenerator-globaltool)
# Find all cobertura files and generate report to /tmp/<folder>
reportgenerator \
  -reports:"tests/**/TestResults/**/*.cobertura.xml" \
  -targetdir:/tmp/code_coverage \
  -reporttypes:"Html;TextSummary"

# View the text summary
cat /tmp/code_coverage/Summary.txt

# Open HTML report in browser
xdg-open /tmp/code_coverage/index.html   # Linux
open /tmp/code_coverage/index.html        # macOS
```

**Key configuration** (`src/testconfig.json`):
- `modulePaths.include`: `ReactiveUI\\.Binding\\..*` — covers all production assemblies
- `modulePaths.exclude`: `.*Tests.*`, `.*TestRunner.*`, `.*TestModels.*` — excludes test/runner/model assemblies
- `skipAutoProperties: true` — auto-properties excluded from coverage metrics

**Tips:**
- Always clean `bin/` and `obj/` folders before coverage runs to avoid stale results
- The `ReactiveUI.Binding.GeneratedCode.TestModels` assembly has `[assembly: ExcludeFromCodeCoverage]` so it won't appear in reports even though its module path matches the include pattern
- `ReactiveUI.Binding.Reactive` carries the same attribute (applied via `<AssemblyAttribute>` in its .csproj). It is a recompilation of `ReactiveUI.Binding.Shared`, so every line in it is a line `ReactiveUI.Binding` already covers — only the scheduler binding and the namespace differ. Cover shared code through the lean leaf; the `modulePaths` exclusions do not reach an assembly that is only present as a copied reference
- `DiagnosticWarnings.cs` coverage appears as 0% in `ReactiveUI.Binding.SourceGenerators` — this is a linked-file artifact; the code is actually tested via the `ReactiveUI.Binding.Analyzer` assembly
- Put coverage reports in `/tmp/` to avoid accidentally committing them

## Architecture Overview

### What This Project Does

ReactiveUI.Binding.SourceGenerators is an **incremental source generator** that replaces ReactiveUI's runtime expression tree analysis with compile-time code generation for property observation and binding. It eliminates runtime reflection, is fully AOT/trimming safe, and supports all ReactiveUI platform notification mechanisms.

### Three Pipelines

**Pipeline A (Type Detection)**: Scans classes with base lists → builds `ClassBindingInfo` POCOs with boolean flags for each notification mechanism (IReactiveObject, INPC, WPF DP, WinUI DP, KVO, WinForms, Android). Per-kind generators filter from this shared pipeline. Consolidates into a single `[ModuleInitializer]` registration.

**Pipeline B (Invocation Detection)**: Scans method invocations (`WhenChanged`, `WhenChanging`, `BindOneWay`, `BindTwoWay`, `WhenAnyValue`) → extracts lambda property paths → generates optimized per-call-site observation/binding code. Uses **CallerFilePath + CallerLineNumber dispatch**: API stubs capture caller info, generated dispatch table routes to compile-time generated methods.

**Pipeline C (View Dispatch)**: Scans classes implementing `IViewFor<T>` → extracts `ViewRegistrationInfo` POCOs (VM FQN, View FQN, constructor availability, `[ViewContract]` contract, `[SingleInstanceView]` flag) → generates `ViewDispatch.g.cs` with a type-switch dispatch function. Supports contract-based multi-view resolution (contract checks emitted before default), singleton caching via `Interlocked.CompareExchange`, and 3-tier resolution (service locator → direct construction → null). Views can be excluded with `[ExcludeFromViewRegistration]`.

### API Pattern

```csharp
// User writes:
var obs = vm.WhenChanged(x => x.Name);

// Generator emits API stub (PostInitializationOutput) with CallerInfo dispatch:
public static IObservable<TReturn> WhenChanged<TObj, TReturn>(
    this TObj obj, Expression<Func<TObj, TReturn>> property,
    [CallerFilePath] string callerFilePath = "",
    [CallerLineNumber] int callerLineNumber = 0) where TObj : class
{
    if (__GeneratedBindingDispatcher.TryGetWhenChanged(callerFilePath, callerLineNumber, obj, out var result))
        return (IObservable<TReturn>)result!;
    throw new InvalidOperationException("...");  // Runtime fallback TBD
}

// Generator emits per-invocation optimized method:
private static IObservable<string> __WhenChanged_0(MyViewModel obj)
{
    return Observable.Create<string>(observer => { ... PropertyChanged subscription ... })
        .StartWith(obj.Name);
}
```

### Where the Dispatch Overloads Live

The generated concrete overloads have to beat the runtime stub at the call site, and they have to do it
without two generator-running assemblies seeing each other's copies. Extension-method lookup decides both:
it walks the enclosing namespaces of the call site from the inside out and **stops at the first level that
offers any candidate**, and a namespace brought in by a `using` (file-level or global) is only ever consulted
at the outermost level.

From C# 10 the overloads go in the **consumer's own root namespace** (`build_property.RootNamespace`,
rendered as identifier segments so a project name like `My-App` still yields a legal namespace), plus a
generated `global using` of it. Two routes, two jobs:

- the root namespace catches call sites nested under it, including a consumer whose own code sits under
  `ReactiveUI.Binding.*` — those reach the stub at an enclosing level, so a `global using` alone never gets
  looked at and the call falls through to the stub's runtime throw;
- the `global using` catches files declared outside the root namespace.

Either way the concrete overload lands in the same candidate set as the generic stub and wins outright, because
a non-generic candidate beats a generic one. A `global using` is scoped to the compilation that declares it and
is never exported, which is what keeps one assembly's overloads out of another's lookup — the case that matters
when the two are joined by `InternalsVisibleTo`, since identical overloads visible from both make every matching
call site ambiguous (CS0121). When the build exposes no root namespace, the fallback is
`ReactiveUI.Binding.Generated.<assembly>`.

The residual risk is two assemblies that **share a root namespace**, grant each other `InternalsVisibleTo`, and
both generate a dispatch for the same concrete types — those calls are ambiguous again. All three have to
coincide; a project and its test project have distinct root namespaces and are unaffected.

Below C# 10 there are no global usings, so there is nothing to scope a namespace with. The overloads stay in
`ReactiveUI.Binding`, where the import every consumer already has reaches them from any file — **unless the
assembly grants `InternalsVisibleTo`**, which is the only way another assembly can see them at all. Those
assemblies emit into their own root namespace instead, which nobody else's code sits under. The cost is that a
file declared outside the root namespace falls back to the runtime path; the alternative for those assemblies
is not universal reach but a build that does not compile (CS0121). With no root namespace to move to, the
shared namespace is kept — nowhere else would be reachable.

### Generating for the Lean or the .Reactive Runtime

The two runtime packages share **no type names** — everything the lean one puts in `ReactiveUI.Binding.*`, the
other puts in `ReactiveUI.Binding.Reactive.*`, and the scheduler abstraction differs outright
(`ISequencer` vs `IScheduler`). Output written for one does not compile against the other at all, so the
generator branches on which package the consumer actually references, detected by looking up the stub class.

The emitters write the lean names throughout, and `RuntimeFlavourRewriter` retargets the finished text when the
consumer is on the System.Reactive package. It runs on the finished text rather than being threaded through the
emitters because most generated bodies are **non-interpolated** raw string literals whose braces are the braces
of the generated code — making them interpolated to inject a namespace would mean escaping every one.

The shift is anchored on the names the runtime namespace actually declares, read from the referenced assembly
rather than listed in the generator. That way it cannot go stale as the runtime grows, and it will not touch a
consumer type that merely happens to sit under `ReactiveUI.Binding` — which is exactly what a consumer whose own
root namespace starts that way would otherwise hit.

Every generated file goes out through `CodeGeneratorHelpers.AddGeneratedSource` so no emitter can forget the
retargeting. Forgetting would only ever show up as generated code that does not compile, for consumers of the
package the test suite reaches least. `ReactiveRuntimeFlavourTests` sweeps **every** shared scenario against the
System.Reactive package for that reason — one unshifted type name in one emitter is enough to break every
consumer on it, and no representative subset can be trusted to reach it.

### Matching the Stub's Parameter List

The concrete overload only beats the generic stub once their parameter lists match — a non-generic candidate is
preferred over a generic one, but that tie-break needs the two to be otherwise indistinguishable. A shorter
parameter list leaves both merely applicable, neither better, and **every matching call site fails with CS0121**.

The stub declares its `[CallerArgumentExpression]` parameters wherever the attribute is available to it, which
is a property of the *target framework*. Whether dispatch can use them is a property of the *language version*,
and the two vary independently: `<LangVersion>7.3</LangVersion>` on `net8.0` is a perfectly ordinary project.
So `LanguageFeatures` carries them separately:

- `StubHasExpressionParameters` — the attribute type is present **and accessible** from the consumer's assembly.
  Drives whether the parameters are emitted at all. Accessibility matters: on a framework without the attribute
  the only one in reach is the runtime library's own `internal` polyfill, which generated code cannot apply.
- `SupportsCallerArgExpr` — the above **and** C# 10. Drives whether the parameters carry the attribute and
  whether dispatch matches on expression text rather than on `CallerFilePath` + `CallerLineNumber`.

Below C# 10 on a framework that has the attribute, the parameters are emitted unattributed and inert: they exist
only so the lists line up, and dispatch runs off the file and line.

### WhenChanged vs WhenChanging

| API | Interface | Event | Timing |
|-----|-----------|-------|--------|
| `WhenChanged` | `INotifyPropertyChanged` | `PropertyChanged` | After value changes |
| `WhenChanging` | `INotifyPropertyChanging` | `PropertyChanging` | Before value changes |

Not all platforms support before-change notifications (WPF DP, WinUI DP, WinForms, Android do not). The analyzer reports RXUIBIND004 when `WhenChanging` targets an unsupported platform type.

### Diagnostic IDs

| ID | Severity | Description |
|----|----------|-------------|
| RXUIBIND001 | Info | Expression must be inline lambda for compile-time optimization |
| RXUIBIND002 | Warning | Type has no observable properties |
| RXUIBIND003 | Warning | Expression contains private/protected member |
| RXUIBIND004 | Warning | Type does not support before-change notifications |
| RXUIBIND005 | Info | Source type implements INotifyDataErrorInfo; validation binding requires runtime engine |
| RXUIBIND006 | Warning | Expression contains an unsupported path segment (indexer, field, or method call) |
| RXUIBIND007 | Warning | BindCommand control has no bindable event |
| RXUIBIND008 | Warning | Property does not implement IInteraction |
| RXUIBIND009 | Warning | Generated binding dispatch is out of reach from this file |

## Code Style & Quality Requirements

**CRITICAL:** All code must comply with ReactiveUI contribution guidelines: https://www.reactiveui.net/contribute/index.html

### Style Enforcement

- EditorConfig rules (`.editorconfig`)
- StyleCop Analyzers - builds fail on violations
- Roslynator Analyzers - additional code quality rules
- **All public APIs require XML documentation comments**
- **RS2008**: Analyzer release tracking enabled (`AnalyzerReleases.Shipped.md` / `AnalyzerReleases.Unshipped.md`)

### C# Style Rules

- **Braces:** Allman style
- **Indentation:** 4 spaces, no tabs
- **Fields:** `_camelCase` for private/internal
- **Visibility:** Always explicit, visibility first modifier
- **Namespaces:** File-scoped preferred
- **Modern C#:** Nullable reference types, pattern matching, records, init setters
- **netstandard2.0 targets:** Use `IsExternalInit.cs` polyfill for records; avoid APIs not available in netstandard2.0 (e.g., use `if (x is null) throw new System.ArgumentNullException(...)` instead of `ArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNull()`)

## Analyzer Suppression Policy

**NO analyzer suppressions are allowed unless discussed and approved first.** This applies to every form of suppression: `[SuppressMessage]` attributes, `#pragma warning disable`, `.editorconfig` severity downgrades, and `<NoWarn>` in project files. **Fix the underlying issue instead.**

If a rule genuinely cannot be fixed without changing behavior or public API, **STOP and raise it for discussion — do not suppress unilaterally, and do not present a suppression as if it were a fix.**

### Pre-approved suppressions (the ONLY ones allowed without further discussion)

| Rule | Where it may be suppressed | Justification text |
|------|----------------------------|--------------------|
| **S107** (too many parameters) | The **offending method only** (never class-level) where the parameter count is inherent — e.g. CombineLatest selector lambdas, CallerInfo dispatch stubs. | parameter count is inherent to the API/overload under test |
| **S4018** (generic type param not inferable) | **Public / interface-dictated** generic methods whose signature cannot change. Must be **fixed** (refactored) when the method is private/internal and refactorable. | type parameter is dictated by the interface / specified explicitly by the caller |
| **S100 / S101** (PascalCase naming) | Only for established domain acronyms: **INPC** (INotifyPropertyChanged), **KVO** (Key-Value Observing), **POCO**. | established acronym matching ReactiveUI domain terminology |
| **S2360** (optional parameters) | Only the CallerInfo dispatch stubs (e.g. `ReactiveSchedulerExtensions`) where converting to overloads would exceed the parameter-count limit (S107). | part of the CallerInfo dispatch contract; overloads would exceed the parameter limit |
| **CA1040** (empty interfaces) | Only interfaces that are intentional **marker interfaces** (e.g. `IActivatableView`). | intentional marker interface |

Anything **not** in this table — including (non-exhaustively) S103, S2342, S4070, RCS1157, CA1019, CA1508, S6566, S6562 — must be **fixed**, or **discussed and approved before any suppression is added**.

## Key Architectural Patterns

### Value-Equatable Models (Critical for Caching)

All pipeline models are `sealed record` types with value equality. NEVER include `ISymbol`, `SyntaxNode`, or `Location` in pipeline outputs. Use `EquatableArray<T>` for array equality. Extract strings from symbols using `ToDisplayString(SymbolDisplayFormat.FullyQualifiedFormat)`.

### Code Generation Strategy

- Uses StringBuilder, NOT SyntaxFactory
- Generated code emitted as C# source via `context.AddSource()`
- `#pragma warning disable` at top of generated files
- All generated types use `[Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Embedded]` attribute

### Where the Observation Helper Classes Are Declared

Some plugins (`KVOObservationPlugin`, `WinUIObservationPlugin`) emit observation code that instantiates helper
classes by bare name — `__KVOObservable<T>`, `__KVOObserver`, `__WinUIDPObservable<T>`. Every dispatch file is
another part of the same `__ReactiveUIGeneratedBindings` class, so one part declaring them is enough for all of
them, and two parts declaring them is a duplicate-member error.

`ObservationHelperGenerator` therefore owns the declarations outright, in `ObservationHelpers.g.cs`. Emitters
only ever reference the helpers; none of them declare any. Which helpers to declare is decided from the
**detected types**, not from the call sites — a reference can only be emitted for a type
`CodeGeneratorHelpers.FindClassInfo` matched, so the declarations are a superset of the references whichever
binding API reaches for them. Deciding it from the call sites is what left `BindOneWay`, `BindTwoWay`, `Bind`,
`OneWayBind`, `WhenAny` and `WhenAnyObservable` emitting references to types nobody declared.

### Two-Layer Language Version Constraint

There are **two distinct C# language contexts** in this project:

**Generator source code** (the `.cs` files in `ReactiveUI.Binding.SourceGenerators/`):
- Compiled with the **latest** C# language version (currently C# 12)
- Can freely use raw string literals (`$$"""`), file-scoped namespaces, pattern matching (`is not`), records, switch expressions, etc.
- Must target **netstandard2.0** (Roslyn requirement), but the SDK/language version is latest

**Generated output** (the strings emitted by the generator into user projects):
- Must be **C# 7.3 compatible** — user projects may target older frameworks
- Must follow the **ReactiveUI coding standard** (https://www.reactiveui.net/contribute/index.html) as closely as possible within C# 7.3 constraints
- Key rules for generated output:
  - **Allman-style braces** — each brace on a new line
  - **4-space indentation** — no tabs
  - **Properly formatted multi-line code** — no single-line walls of text for non-trivial expressions
  - **Explicit visibility modifiers** — visibility first (e.g. `private static`, not `static private`)
  - Method bodies indented consistently at 12 spaces (namespace=0, class=4, member=8, body=12)
- C# 7.3 restrictions for generated output — do NOT use:
  - `is not`, `and`, `or` pattern combinators (C# 9)
  - `??=` null-coalescing assignment (C# 8)
  - Switch expressions (C# 8)
  - `required` members (C# 11)
  - Raw string literals (C# 11)
  - File-scoped namespaces (C# 10)
  - `init` setters (C# 9)
- Generated output must NOT use `#nullable enable` or nullable reference type annotations (`T?` where T is a reference type) — these are C# 8+ features
- `static` lambdas are C# 9 — do not use in generated output

### Analyzer Separation (Roslyn Best Practice)

- Generator does NOT report diagnostics
- Separate analyzer project reports all RXUIBIND diagnostics
- `DiagnosticWarnings.cs` and `Constants.cs` are linked from generator to analyzer via `<Compile Include="..." Link="..." />`

### Shared File Linking

The analyzer project links shared files from the generator project:
```xml
<Compile Include="..\ReactiveUI.Binding.SourceGenerators\DiagnosticWarnings.cs" Link="DiagnosticWarnings.cs" />
<Compile Include="..\ReactiveUI.Binding.SourceGenerators\Constants.cs" Link="Constants.cs" />
```

### The Lean / .Reactive Seam

`ReactiveUI.Binding.Shared` holds the whole runtime library and is compiled twice:

| Leaf | Scheduler type | Namespaces |
|------|----------------|------------|
| `ReactiveUI.Binding` | `ReactiveUI.Primitives.Concurrency.ISequencer` | `ReactiveUI.Binding.*` |
| `ReactiveUI.Binding.Reactive` | `System.Reactive.Concurrency.IScheduler` | `ReactiveUI.Binding.Reactive.*` |

`ReactiveShim.props` (imported by `Directory.Build.props`) keys on the `.Reactive` project-name suffix: it
defines `REACTIVE_SHIM` and aliases `ISequencer` onto `IScheduler`. A future platform leaf such as
`ReactiveUI.Binding.Wpf.Reactive` picks the seam up with no further wiring.

Rules for anything in `ReactiveUI.Binding.Shared`:

- Name only `ISequencer`, never `IScheduler` or a Primitives sequencer type directly.
- Declare namespaces with the macro, so both leaves get their own:
  ```csharp
  #if REACTIVE_SHIM
  namespace ReactiveUI.Binding.Reactive.Observables;
  #else
  namespace ReactiveUI.Binding.Observables;
  #endif
  ```
- Never write a per-file `using ReactiveUI.Binding.*;` — those namespaces shift between leaves, so the
  import has to come from each csproj as a `<Using>` item (unshifted vs shifted).
- Only call scheduler APIs that exist in both flavours. The state-carrying
  `Schedule<TState>(TState, Func<scheduler, TState, IDisposable>)` is the shared shape; the plain
  `Action<TState>` overload exists on `ISequencer` but binds to recursive scheduling on `IScheduler`.

The platform packages follow the same shape: `ReactiveUI.Binding.<Platform>.Shared` is compiled by
`ReactiveUI.Binding.<Platform>` and `ReactiveUI.Binding.<Platform>.Reactive`, with namespaces shifting
`ReactiveUI.Binding.<Platform>` to `ReactiveUI.Binding.Reactive.<Platform>`. Neither platform leaf
references System.Reactive directly — `AnonymousObservable` and `ActionDisposable<TState>` in
`ReactiveUI.Binding.Platform.Shared` replace `Observable.Create`/`Disposable.Create`, and are compiled
privately into each platform assembly rather than added to the base library's surface.

### Platform Test Projects

Each platform package is tested by a pair: `ReactiveUI.Binding.<Platform>.Tests` owns the test source, and
`ReactiveUI.Binding.<Platform>.Tests.Reactive` has no source of its own — it links the lean project's `.cs`
so the same assertions run against both leaves. **The `.Reactive` suffix must come last in the name**, or
`ReactiveShim.props` will not recognise it and the mirror silently compiles against the lean namespaces.

WPF and WinForms tests target the windows TFMs and need the Windows Desktop runtime, so off Windows
`Directory.Build.targets` demotes them (`IsTestProject`, `IsTestingPlatformApplication`,
`TestingPlatformDotnetTestSupport` to false, `OutputType` to `Library`). They still compile on every leg;
they only execute on the Windows one. That demotion has to live in `Directory.Build.targets`, not
`Directory.Build.props` — the testing-platform props set those back to true after props are evaluated, and
launching a windows-TFM app on Linux fails the whole run with "Zero tests ran" even when every real test
passed. The MAUI pair is exempt: it targets the plain TFMs and runs everywhere.

Test fixtures that the product code finds by reflection must be `public` — the WinForms observer looks up
`{PropertyName}Changed` over public members only, so an `internal` fixture would pass for the wrong reason.

### Building Windows Targets off Windows

`MakePri.exe` and `cswinrt.exe` are native Windows binaries. On Linux/macOS the build reaches for them
through Wine, which crashes. `build/SkipMakePriOnNonWindows.targets` turns that pipeline off, imported
by a `Directory.Build.targets` in each Windows-desktop project (WPF and MAUI, both leaves) under
`Condition="!$([MSBuild]::IsOsPlatform('Windows'))"`, so real Windows builds still generate PRI.

**That `Directory.Build.targets` must sit in the project's own folder.** MSBuild discovers it by walking
up from the project directory, so moving it into a `*.Shared` source folder silently disables it — the
build keeps working right up until Wine starts. Each copy chains to the repository-level file with
`GetPathOfFileAbove`; without that chain it shadows `src/Directory.Build.targets` instead of adding to it.

### ConditionalWeakTable Symbol Caching

`MetadataExtractor.cs` uses `ConditionalWeakTable<Compilation, WellKnownSymbolsBox>` to cache resolved well-known type symbols per compilation, avoiding repeated `GetTypeByMetadataName` calls.

## Common Tasks

### Adding a New Generator Pipeline

1. Create value-equatable POCO in `Models/`
2. Add syntax predicate to `RoslynHelpers.cs`
3. Add extraction logic to `MetadataExtractor.cs`
4. Create invocation generator in `Invocations/` with `Register()` method
5. Wire into `BindingGenerator.cs` `Initialize()`
6. Add code generation to `CodeGeneration/CodeGenerator.cs`
7. Add snapshot test in generator test project
8. Accept snapshots using `VerifierSettings.AutoVerify()` trick

### Adding a New Analyzer Diagnostic

1. Add descriptor to `DiagnosticWarnings.cs` (shared file)
2. Update `AnalyzerReleases.Unshipped.md` in both projects
3. Create/update analyzer in `ReactiveUI.Binding.Analyzer/Analyzers/`
4. Add tests in `ReactiveUI.Binding.Analyzer.Tests/`
5. Use `AnalyzerTestHelper.GetDiagnosticsAsync<T>()` for testing

### Accepting Snapshot Changes

1. Enable `VerifierSettings.AutoVerify()` in `AssemblySetup.cs`
2. Run tests: `dotnet test --project tests/ReactiveUI.Binding.SourceGenerators.Tests/... -c Release`
3. Disable `VerifierSettings.AutoVerify()` in `AssemblySetup.cs`
4. Re-run tests to confirm they pass without AutoVerify

## What to Avoid

- **ISymbol/SyntaxNode in pipeline outputs** - breaks incremental caching
- **Runtime reflection** in generated code - breaks AOT compatibility
- **SyntaxFactory for code generation** - use StringBuilder instead
- **Diagnostics in generator** - use separate analyzer project
- **LINQ in hot paths** - use manual loops (Roslyn convention)
- **Non-value-equatable models** in pipeline - breaks caching
- **APIs unavailable in netstandard2.0** in generator/analyzer projects

## Important Notes

- **Required .NET SDKs:** .NET 8.0, 9.0, and 10.0
- **Generator + Analyzer targets:** netstandard2.0 (Roslyn requirement)
- **Runtime library targets:** net8.0;net9.0;net10.0;net462;net472;net481
- **No shallow clones:** Repository requires full clone for Nerdbank.GitVersioning
- **Where the analyzers ship:** `ReactiveUI.Binding` and `ReactiveUI.Binding.Reactive` each pack the generator
  and analyzer DLLs into `analyzers/dotnet/cs`, so referencing a runtime package is all a consumer needs.
  `ReactiveUI.Binding.SourceGenerators` is a compatibility package that ships only the MSBuild props: a second
  copy of the same assemblies under a different package root loads as a second generator and emits every
  dispatch file twice, which fails the consumer's build

**Philosophy:** Generate zero-reflection, AOT-compatible property observation and binding code at compile-time. Support all ReactiveUI platform notification mechanisms. Fall back to runtime expression analysis only when compile-time analysis is not possible.
