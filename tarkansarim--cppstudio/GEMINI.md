# CppStudio Agent Notes

This repo is the canonical working source for reusable Codex infrastructure around future
C++/CUDA/Vulkan development.

## Required Orientation

- This is not a generated sample project. Do not treat it as a C++ app/library repo.
- The main artifact is the user-level Codex skill source at `skills/cpp-cuda-vulkan-studio/`.
- If available in the session, use the project skill `cppstudio-repo-onboarding` when starting
  work in this repo.
- The installed user-level copy at `${HOME}/.codex/skills/cpp-cuda-vulkan-studio` is a
  deployment target, not the source of truth.

## Source Of Truth

- Edit `skills/cpp-cuda-vulkan-studio/` in this repo.
- Use Planning Harness for durable planned-work state. The legacy
  `important-instruction-ledger` remains available only as a selective Recovery
  diagnostic; do not require it for ordinary CppStudio source edits.
- Use `docs/CODEBASE_ARCHITECTURE_INDEX.md` and `docs/CODEBASE_SUBSYSTEM_MANIFEST.json` as the
  maintained code map for this repo.
- Before changing repo files, use the maintained code map to choose the matching subsystem doc and
  primary paths for the work.
- Publish normal user-level Codex installs with `./scripts/rollout_to_codex.sh`.
- Use `./scripts/sync_to_codex.sh` only for dry runs, diagnostics, or an explicitly scoped
  single-skill sync.
- Do not hand-edit `${HOME}/.codex/skills/cpp-cuda-vulkan-studio` as the long-term source.
- Do not move private app, local workstation, or other project-specific skills back into user-level
  Codex from this repo.

## Evidence Routing

- Use repository facts first. Load donor or peer-tool evidence when a change
  depends on an unfamiliar design, product-shape choice, or external behavior.
- Use official specifications, headers, examples, and tests for standardized
  formats, protocols, SDK schemas, and conformance work.
- Do not require donor research for a bounded change whose owner and contract
  are already clear.

## Supervised Worker Interrogation

- When supervising a tmux, subagent, or other worker and the worker makes, skips, or rejects a
  decision for unclear reasons, interrogate that worker before claiming the cause, patching skills, or
  deciding no CppStudio fix is needed.
- Ask for the exact skill routes, donor routes, web/upstream sources, decision criteria, gaps, and
  verification commands that led to the behavior. Treat the answer as evidence to check against the
  transcript and files, not as authority.
- If the worker is unreachable, state that directly and inspect the transcript, project files, and
  CppStudio rules before drawing conclusions. Do not infer motives or root causes from memory.
- During supervised production lanes, continuously watch for worker behavior that points to a
  reusable CppStudio gap: skipped donor/profile routing, weak or mismatched verification, stale
  binaries, bad OSTM/session evidence, ignored code-map maintenance, unsupported helper commands,
  premature closeout, or drift from the approved slice. When such a signal appears, preserve the
  evidence, interrogate the worker if needed, and fix CppStudio or follow user-level cross-repo
  routing instead of treating it as a one-off worker mistake.

## Vulkan-Leaning Defaults

- If the user asks for a new GPU, 3D, rendering, realtime, simulation-visualization, XR, or
  cross-platform C++ project and does not specify CUDA or Vulkan, recommend Vulkan before the project
  starts because it gives the project an easier path to cross-platform and cross-vendor hardware
  compatibility.
- If the user does not choose after that recommendation, proceed with a Vulkan-first plan and state
  the assumption. Do not stop solely to ask whether they meant CUDA unless the requirements clearly
  imply custom CUDA kernels, NVIDIA-only libraries, or CUDA-specific deployment.
- When Vulkan is chosen by the user or assumed by default, keep the project Vulkan-only by default:
  do not add CUDA, CUDA interop, CUDA tests, CUDA runtime requirements, or CUDA donor routing unless
  the user explicitly asks for CUDA/Vulkan interop or the requirements force a CUDA-specific compute
  path.
- When the user explicitly chooses the CUDA lane, Vulkan may be mixed in when it is needed or clearly
  more convenient for presentation, realtime visualization, graphics, XR, swapchain/display work, or
  CUDA/Vulkan interop. State why the mixed lane is justified and keep the CUDA/Vulkan boundary
  explicit in build options, tests, and documentation.
- When both Vulkan and CUDA are plausible, document and route the Vulkan path first, then keep CUDA
  as a separate alternative lane, not as something automatically mixed into the Vulkan plan.
- For reusable 3D, rendering, realtime visualization, XR, or cross-vendor GPU work, frame the
  default route as Vulkan-first when requirements do not force an NVIDIA-only path.
- Prefer Vulkan-oriented donors, validation, shader tooling, synchronization notes, and CTest labels
  first for graphics/realtime tasks. Escalate to CUDA donors first only for custom CUDA kernels,
  CUTLASS/cuBLAS/cuDNN/TensorRT-style integrations, CUDA graphs, or explicitly NVIDIA-only targets.
- Keep CUDA support intact. Do not remove CUDA options, CUDA tests, CUDA donors, or CUDA companion
  skill links just to make the package feel more Vulkan-oriented.
- Keep the global skill generic: Vulkan bias belongs in reusable routing and ordering, not in
  project-specific rules for a single app.

## Validation

- Run `python3 scripts/validate_code_map.py . --require-enabled` after edits that affect CppStudio
  subsystem ownership, routing, generated template behavior, validation, rollout, public docs, CI, or
  changelog policy.
- Run `./scripts/validate.sh` after edits to skill text, scripts, metadata, or sync behavior.
- Run `./scripts/validate.sh --full` after edits to:
  - `assets/app-library-template/`
  - scaffolding or apply scripts
  - CMake presets/modules
  - generated-project validation behavior
- Before pushing validation-affecting changes, run the GitHub workflow-equivalent local gate, not
  only `validate.sh` or rollout:
  `bash -n scripts/*.sh skills/cpp-cuda-vulkan-studio/scripts/*.sh && shellcheck scripts/*.sh skills/cpp-cuda-vulkan-studio/scripts/*.sh && PYTHONPYCACHEPREFIX=/tmp/cppstudio-pycache python3 -m py_compile scripts/*.py skills/cpp-cuda-vulkan-studio/scripts/*.py && python3 scripts/validate_donor_library.py skills/cpp-cuda-vulkan-studio/references/donor-library --reference-root skills/cpp-cuda-vulkan-studio/references && python3 scripts/validate_trigger_matrix.py research/donor-library/trigger-matrix.json --repo-root . && VALIDATOR=$PWD/scripts/quick_validate_skill.py CPPSTUDIO_FULL_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=75 CPPSTUDIO_SKIP_CUDA_RUNTIME_TESTS=1 ./scripts/validate.sh --full`.
  This gate is required after edits to shell scripts, Python validators, CI/workflow files,
  generated templates, CMake/toolchain behavior, package manifests, donor validation, trigger
  validation, or any previous push that failed GitHub validation. Rollout validation is an install
  proof; it is not a substitute for this CI gate.
- Run a fresh-agent trigger lane when discoverability, routing, or state
  selection changes. Pure wording, reference, or implementation changes use
  focused source validation unless their claim requires behavioral proof.
- The rollout script validates the router package, removes known former top-level CppStudio skills,
  and updates the user-level relay. The sync script validates only the router package.
- If validation fails because of a real script/template issue, fix the repo copy first, then rerun
  rollout or the explicitly selected sync.

## Sync Behavior

- `./scripts/sync_to_codex.sh` publishes this repo's skill copy to user-level Codex.
- It uses `rsync --delete` by default so the installed skill exactly matches this repo.
- Pass `--dry-run` to preview changes.
- Pass `--no-delete` only for diagnostics; normal publishing should keep delete enabled.
- `./scripts/watch_to_codex.sh` continuously validates and syncs after file changes.
- `./scripts/rollout_to_codex.sh` validates and syncs the one canonical router package, removes known
  former top-level CppStudio skills, and verifies source/target parity.

## Safe Editing Rules

- Keep reusable policy generic. Do not add private-app-only, local-workstation-only, or machine-only
  workflow rules to `skills/cpp-cuda-vulkan-studio/`; those belong in project-level skills.
- Keep the maintained code map in sync. If a change affects source skill routing, donor-library
  routing, generated-project template behavior, validation/sync/rollout scripts, companion snippets,
  research provenance, public docs, CI, or change-history policy, update the matching
  `docs/SUBSYSTEMS/*.md` doc and `docs/CODEBASE_SUBSYSTEM_MANIFEST.json` in the same work stream.
- If this repo installs user-level `AGENTS.md` content, merge or append only the tiny marked
  CppStudio relay block. It should only tell agents to load `cpp-cuda-vulkan-studio` for native
  C++ GPU/realtime/code-map/Vulkan/CUDA work; lane policy stays inside the skill. Content inside the
  marked relay block is managed by this repo and may be replaced on reinstall; content outside the
  markers is user-owned and must be preserved. Relay targets must be named `AGENTS.md` and must not
  be symlinks.
- Preserve intentional template placeholders such as `{{PROJECT_NAME}}` and `{{CPP_NAMESPACE}}`.
- Do not commit generated temp projects, build directories, profiler traces, or Python
  `__pycache__` files.
- Prefer updating the reusable scripts over copying long command sequences into docs when behavior
  must stay deterministic.
- Keep research notes under `research/` and reusable skill instructions under
  `skills/cpp-cuda-vulkan-studio/`; do not mix process notes into installed user-level skill files.
- Before pushing to remote, update `CHANGELOG.md` with a concise entry for tracked user-visible
  changes, validation/CI changes, generated-template changes, donor-library changes, or install/sync
  behavior changes.
- Also update README Recent Commit Highlights as the front-page changelog when a pushed commit
  changes setup, routing, generated projects, validation, donor-library behavior, public docs,
  install, release, or sync behavior.
- Do not rely on a chat promise that future pushes will remember these docs. Before committing or
  pushing from this repo, explicitly inspect the staged diff and report whether `CHANGELOG.md` and
  README Recent Commit Highlights are included and readable, or why the change is non-qualifying. If
  either qualifying change-history surface is missing or the front-page changelog is unreadable,
  update it before the commit instead of promising to do better later.

## Close-Out

When finishing work here, report:

- files changed at the repo level
- whether `./scripts/validate.sh` or `./scripts/validate.sh --full` passed
- whether the GitHub workflow-equivalent gate passed before push when the change touched validation,
  CI, scripts, generated templates, package manifests, donor validation, or trigger validation
- whether `./scripts/rollout_to_codex.sh` was run for normal bundled installs, or which explicit
  single-skill `./scripts/sync_to_codex.sh` run was used and why
- whether the sub-agent trigger lane was run when skill/donor routing changed
- whether `CHANGELOG.md` was updated before any push to remote
- whether README Recent Commit Highlights was updated as a readable front-page changelog before any
  qualifying push to remote
- the exact reason if either change-history surface was not updated
- any installed-tool gaps, such as missing `clang-format` or `clang-tidy`
