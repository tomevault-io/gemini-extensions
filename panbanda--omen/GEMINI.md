### Key Patterns

**Analyzer pattern**: Each analyzer module follows the same structure:
1. Public `analyze()` function taking path and options
2. Returns a result struct with analysis data
3. Implements `Serialize` for JSON output
4. Uses rayon for parallel file processing

**Multi-language parsing**: `parser/mod.rs` contains `Language` enum and `Parser` struct. Add new language support by:
1. Adding variant to `Language` enum
2. Implementing tree-sitter grammar in `parser()`
3. Adding node types in extraction functions

**Concurrent file processing**: Uses rayon's parallel iterators:
```rust
files.par_iter()
    .filter_map(|path| analyze_file(path).ok())
    .collect()
```

**Configuration**: Config loaded from `omen.toml` or `.omen/omen.toml`. See `omen.example.toml` for all options.

**MCP server**: JSON-RPC server in `mcp/` module exposing all analyzers as tools for LLM integration. Tool names are bare analyzer names (e.g., `complexity`, `satd`, `temporal`) -- no prefix.

**`--since` flag**: Commands that accept `--since` (e.g., `report generate`, `score trend`) default to `"all"` (full repo history). The value `"all"` is handled by `is_since_all()` in `src/git/log.rs`, which causes `parse_since_to_days()` to return `None` (no time limit). Duration values like `3m`, `6m`, `1y` still work.

### CLI Commands

Top-level commands (flat structure):
- `complexity` - Cyclomatic and cognitive complexity
- `satd` - Self-admitted technical debt
- `deadcode` - Unused code detection
- `churn` - Git history file churn
- `clones` - Code clone detection
- `defect` - Defect probability prediction
- `changes` - Commit-level change risk (JIT)
- `diff` - Branch diff risk analysis
- `tdg` - Technical Debt Gradient
- `graph` - Dependency graph
- `hotspot` - High churn + complexity files
- `temporal` - Temporal coupling
- `ownership` - Code ownership and bus factor
- `cohesion` - CK object-oriented metrics
- `repomap` - PageRank-ranked symbol map
- `smells` - Architectural smell detection
- `flags` - Feature flag detection
- `mutation` - Mutation testing (21 operators across 5 languages)
- `score` - Repository health score
- `all` - Run all analyzers
- `context` - Deep context for LLMs
- `report` - HTML health reports
- `mcp` - Start MCP server

**Global flags**: `-p/--path`, `-f/--format`, `-c/--config`, `-v/--verbose`, `-j/--jobs`, `--no-cache`, `--ref`, `--shallow`

### Report System

`omen report generate` runs all analyzers in parallel, then invokes LLM analyst agents to produce insight narratives, and renders an HTML report via `src/report/render.rs`.

Key files:
- `src/report/render.rs` -- loads JSON data files + optional insight JSON files, renders HTML
- `src/report/types.rs` -- all Rust types for report data and insights (must match agent output schemas)
- `src/report/template.html` -- Handlebars HTML template
- `plugins/reporting/commands/generate-report.md` -- orchestration command (runs analyzers, spawns agents)
- `plugins/reporting/agents/` -- 12 analyst agents that produce `{section_insight: string}` JSON

When adding a new report section: add the insight type to `types.rs`, add a field to `RenderData`, add loading logic in `render.rs`, add the template section in `template.html`, and create an analyst agent.

### Plugin Structure

```
plugins/
  development/
    skills/       - Claude Code skills (workflows using CLI commands)
  reporting/
    agents/       - LLM analyst agents for report insights
    commands/     - Orchestration commands (e.g., generate-report)
```

Skills use CLI commands (`omen -f json <analyzer>`) not MCP tools. Each skill has a `SKILL.md` with a YAML frontmatter block (`name`, `description`) and a workflow section.

## Development Workflow

**Always use Test-Driven Development (TDD):**

1. RED: Write a failing test first
2. Verify the test fails for the expected reason
3. GREEN: Write minimal code to pass the test
4. Verify all tests pass
5. REFACTOR: Clean up while keeping tests green

No production code without a failing test first.

### Test Organization

Tests are co-located with source files using `#[cfg(test)]` modules:

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_feature() {
        // ...
    }
}
```

Integration tests live in `tests/` directory.

### Coverage Requirements

- Minimum 80% line coverage enforced by CI
- Run `cargo llvm-cov` to check coverage locally
- Coverage report excludes `main.rs`

### Pull Request Requirements

**Performance PRs**: When submitting a PR that claims performance improvements, include before/after benchmarks in the PR description. Run the old version and new version on a representative dataset and document the timing difference.

## Accuracy Requirements

Omen is a code analysis tool where accuracy is paramount. When making changes:

- **No sampling or approximation**: Analyze all requested data points. Do not skip, sample, or approximate to improve performance.
- **No guessing**: Use actual data from git history and file analysis. Do not estimate or infer values.
- **Deterministic results**: The same input must always produce the same output.
- **Performance through parallelization**: Improve speed by doing work in parallel, not by doing less work.

## Supported Languages

Go, Rust, Python, TypeScript, JavaScript, TSX/JSX, Java, C, C++, C#, Ruby, PHP, Bash

### Multi-language requirements

Any analyzer feature that operates on source code must be implemented and tested for all supported languages where the feature applies. This includes:

- **TDG critical defect detection**: Each language defines its own dangerous patterns detected via tree-sitter AST (not string matching). Tests must cover both detection of real calls and rejection of false positives in string literals/comments.
- **Complexity analysis**: Decision-point node types must be defined per language in `parser/queries.rs`.
- **Dead code detection**: Language-specific entry points, visibility rules, and export conventions must be handled.
- **Cohesion (CK metrics)**: Class-equivalent constructs must be defined per language (e.g. Rust struct+impl, Go struct+methods).

When adding a new language feature, write tests for every supported language before implementing.
