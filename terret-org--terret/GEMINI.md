# Terret

Ruby-native, model-agnostic agent harness where everything is a plugin. Twelve gems in one
repo:

- `gems/hames` is the kernel. Services in a context, typed events, reversible effects,
  dependency-driven boot. It knows nothing about LLMs and is reusable for any
  plugin-composed application.
- `gems/terret-core` is the harness built on it. Session log, tools pipeline, agent loop,
  LLM seam (vocabulary, `AdapterBase` retry policy, `FakeAdapter`), plus the M6
  long-lived-agent services: durable approvals (`ctx[:approvals]`, opt-in per tool), the
  compactor on the sole-provider `ctx[:summarizer]` seam, the titler, and hot-reloadable
  per-agent policy (`AllowList` as a log projection). M8 added the sole-provider
  `ctx[:subagents]` seam (a child agent on a fresh session, run to completion) and the
  loop's tool barrier, which runs a message's `concurrency: :parallel` calls together on
  the reactor while a `:serial` tool is a barrier of one. `Terret::Credentials`
  (`ctx[:credentials]`) lives here too: ENV `<PROVIDER>_API_KEY` first, then an optional
  AES-256-GCM file store, every resolved value fed to the scrubber.
- `gems/terret-openrouter` is the one real adapter (plan §6.5): OpenRouter's
  OpenAI-compatible API behind `ctx.llm`, streaming SSE with tool calling and usage
  accounting. The transport is injectable, so its unit tests need no network and no
  gems; only the default `AsyncTransport` requires `async-http`.
- `gems/terret-store-sqlite` is the durable session store (M3): the append-only log
  one event per row in SQLite (WAL) behind the `ctx[:session_store]` seam. Memory and
  JSONL providers live in terret-core; the store row is explicit in every boot.
- `gems/terret-ws` is the v1 interface (M4): one WebSocket per agent behind `ctx[:ws]`,
  the §9.2 frames, exact replay-then-tail on the session log; wire contract in
  `docs/protocol.md`; only the real endpoint requires `async-websocket`.
- `gems/terret-acp` is the second interface (M8): an Agent Client Protocol server behind
  `ctx[:acp]` so an editor can drive an agent over JSON-RPC on stdio. It consumes
  `session/event` and drives `ctx[:loop]` — the same two seams the socket does, on a
  different transport, with no change to core; mapping in `docs/acp.md`. stdlib-only.
- `gems/terret-mcp` is the MCP client (M5): manceps-backed stdio and streamable-HTTP
  servers mounted as `mcp__<server>__<tool>` sources behind `ctx[:tools]`, per-server
  approval, per-call timeouts, the allow list in terret-core; mapping in `docs/mcp.md`.
- `gems/terret-morph` is a `ctx[:summarizer]` provider (M6): Morph's Compact API on the
  wire proven in the deployed agora integration (bearer key, `compression_ratio: 0.4`,
  nil-on-any-failure), an injectable transport so its unit tests need no network, and a
  `MORPH_LIVE=1` live lane (pending a `MORPH_API_KEY` in this environment).
- `gems/terret-exec` is the execution world (M7, plan §6.6): `ctx[:fs]` with every path
  realpath-contained to a granted workspace dir behind an `fs/authorize` waterfall,
  `ctx[:subprocess]` (spawn and PTY under the one reactor, SIGTERM→SIGKILL cancellation),
  `ctx[:shell]` (one persistent bash per agent, sentinel protocol), `ctx[:terminals]`
  (named long-lived PTYs, capped), and `ctx[:sandbox]` with the `None` provider — every
  argv passes `sandbox.wrap` before it spawns. Stdlib only.
- `gems/terret-tools-std` is the standard roster (M7, plan §6.7): `Read`, `Write`, `Edit`,
  `Glob`, `Grep`, `Bash`, `WebFetch`, `terminal_open`/`input`/`read`/`close` — Claude
  Code's names verbatim, no alias map — registered on those seams with honest
  `mutating`/`approval`/`concurrency` metadata. `Bash`'s approval derives from
  `sandbox.isolated?` at registration; `WebFetch` sits behind a deny-by-default domain
  policy re-checked per redirect hop, plus a host-side loopback/link-local floor. M8 added
  `Task` (delegate to a child agent via `ctx[:subagents]`), `TodoWrite`, and
  `job_start`/`job_collect`/`job_stop` over `ctx[:jobs]`.
- `gems/terret-sandbox-docker` is the container provider (M7): a long-lived container per
  boot, each workspace dir bind-mounted at the same absolute path, argv wrapped into
  `docker exec`, `--network none` by default. One patch row moves the execution world into
  it; docker-gated tests skip clean when the daemon is absent.
- `gems/terret` is the meta-gem and the composition layer (M8, plan §7): bundles ship
  ordered config rows, profiles stack bundles, patches adjust rows by id, and
  `Terret.boot` hands the result to the Hames loader. It ships `terret-base`
  (`config/bundle.yml`), the `headless` profile template, and the `trt` executable
  (`boot`, `dump-config`, `doctor`, `acp`). Its `discover_bundles` mounts a third-party
  bundle off that gem's gemspec `metadata["terret"]`, so a plugin gem becomes composable
  by shipping normally. The contract is `docs/composition.md`; read it and plan §7 before
  changing anything here. `Terret::Meta::VERSION` is the gem's version —
  `Terret::VERSION` belongs to terret-core.

The full roadmap is `docs/terret-implementation-plan.md`; phases are in its §12. What is
here covers M0–M8, the whole harness: kernel, session log with the invariant, tools
pipeline, loop, the OpenRouter adapter, the socket, the MCP client, long-lived agent
hardening (durable approvals, resumable turns, compaction, titling, cost accounting,
hot-reloadable policy), the execution world (fs/subprocess/shell/terminals seams under
workspace scoping, the std tools, sandbox `none` and `docker`, credential redaction at the
tool pipeline and the log-append boundary), and subagents plus the 0.1 release (the `Task`
tool over the `ctx[:subagents]` seam, background `job_*` tools, `TodoWrite`, and a tool
barrier that honors each tool's `concurrency:`; the composition/boot meta-gem and the `trt`
CLI; `trt doctor` validating a profile against each service's `Hames::Schema`; the ACP
editor interface; the bench lane; `ctx[:credentials]`; and a security pass that made the
allow-list floor authoritative, folded hash keys through the log scrubber, gated
config-borne Ruby behind an explicit consent flag, and capped socket replay).
`LLM::FakeAdapter` (canned script replay) remains the test/demo default; the OpenRouter
path is proven by canned-wire tests plus a live smoke lane. Session payloads are
primitives at the append boundary; typed parts encode through `LLM.encode_part`.

Note the plan has drifted from the code in places. It specifies RSpec (this uses minitest),
Ruby 3.4+ (this targets 4.0.6), and a separate `terret-llm` gem (the vocabulary lives in
terret-core). Treat the code as current and the plan as intent.

## Commands

```bash
rake test              # all suites, plain minitest, no bundler needed
rake events:catalog    # regenerates docs/events.md
rake bench             # dispatch overhead + chunk throughput (bench/README.md); BENCH_FLOORS=1 gates on bench/floors.yml
ruby examples/headless_demo.rb
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=... ruby examples/openrouter_demo.rb   # real model; needs async-http
bundle exec ruby examples/ws_demo.rb   # real websocket loopback demo
bundle exec ruby examples/mcp_demo.rb   # MCP tools from a local stdio fixture
ruby examples/lifecycle_demo.rb   # park/resume, compaction, titling, cost, hot policy
ruby examples/exec_demo.rb   # file tools, shell, terminals, redaction; the container act needs docker
ruby examples/subagent_demo.rb   # Task delegation, background jobs, TodoWrite, the tool barrier
ruby examples/boot_demo.rb   # bundles, profiles, patches; dump-config, boot, one turn
```

Ruby 4.0.6, pinned in `.ruby-version` and `mise.toml`. `hames` and `terret-core` have zero
runtime dependencies beyond stdlib, and that is a design constraint rather than a
coincidence. Think hard before adding a gem to any gemspec; network-touching dependencies
belong in adapter/interface gems (`terret-openrouter` carries `async-http`), never in the
kernel or core.

## Invariants worth protecting

**Model-visible means logged.** `Sessions#derive_messages` projects model history from the
append-only durable log, and `assert_log_invariant!` digests the outbound request against
that projection before it reaches an adapter. Middleware that smuggles content into a
request without appending it raises. If you find yourself wanting to relax this to make a
feature work, the feature is wrong.

**Dispatch mode is public contract.** Every event is declared once in
`Terret.declare_events!` with one of `:emit`, `:waterfall`, `:parallel`, `:serial`. The bus
refuses undeclared events and refuses a declared event dispatched through the wrong mode.
`docs/events.md` is generated from those declarations and CI diffs it, so changing a mode
shows up in review.

**Registration is reversible.** Services, listeners, and prompt sections all install
through `ctx.effect`, which returns a disposer recorded against the mounting plugin. That
is what makes `Loader#unload!` and forked agent scopes work. New registration paths go
through `effect` too.

## Conventions

- `# frozen_string_literal: true` on every file.
- `Data.define` for value types, `Struct` only where mutation is the point (`Sessions::Session`).
- Services subclass `Hames::Service`, declare `service_key`, and list dependencies with
  `inject`. The loader mounts in dependency order derived from those lists, so declaring
  `inject` accurately matters more than it looks.
- Config layering replaces a row's config wholesale. It is never a deep merge.
- Tests are plain minitest files run directly by the Rakefile glob, one per gem under
  `gems/*/test/`.

## Adding an event

Declare it in `Terret.declare_events!` with its mode and, if it belongs in the session log,
`durable: true`. Durable events can then be appended via `Sessions#append`, which fans them
out on `session/event`. Run `rake events:catalog` and commit the regenerated
`docs/events.md` in the same change.

## Shipping

Whenever shipping work lands on main — any push, and especially a milestone — update
README.md in the same push so it keeps reflecting the current state of the repo.
