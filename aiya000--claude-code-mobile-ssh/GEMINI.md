# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance on how Claude Code (claude.ai/code) handles the code in this repository.

## Conversations

Use Japanese for conversations with developer.

<!--
For non-Japanese speakers:

Sorry for this instruction.
This project's main author is a Japanese speaker.

Tell 'use Englishe (or another language)' to Claude Code if you want to use another language manually.
Or tell me how to switch the language setting of Claude Code :)
-->

## Writing CLAUDE.md

Use English in this file.

Add a blank line between the title and the first list item if adding new sections with list items.
Also do not add trailing dot to list items like `- An item.`
For example:

```markdown
## Section Title

- First item
- Second item
```

## Project Overview

See README.md for about of Project Overview.
his app is mobile-first experience with PWA functionality.

## Development Commands

Use **bun** as package manager and development server.

```shell-session
# Start development server
$ bun dev

# Run typecheck
$ bun typecheck

# Run lint
$ bun lint # do prettier processing than eslint
$ bun prettier # Format the code with prettier
$ bun eslint # do Lint with the next lint (strict mode)

# Run format
$ bun fix # format the code with prettier and prettier
$ bun fix # fix problems with both prettier and eslint
$ bun fix:prettier # fix only prettier problems
$ bun fix:eslint # fix only eslint problems

# Build production build
$ bun run build # NOTE! `bun build` is a different command. Don't use it for this usage
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application.

```shell-session
# If WSL
$ wslview 'http://localhost:3000'
```

## Architecture

### Technology Stack

- **Next.js** and App Router
- **TypeScript** and strict type safety enforcement
- **React** and **vanilla-extract** for UI components and styling
- **Bun** as package manager and runtime
- **PWA** functionality for mobile experience
- **SSG** to upload gh-pages. MUST NOT USE SSR and any servers

```

#### models/

- Files under this directory will only contain the type that represents a single subject and a general function
  - It does not contain multiple subjects/context
  - It may contain more than one type, but only one subject/context

---

NOTE:
The following example uses Zod, but the project does not yet use Zod.
But this is not the point, so please reread it accordingly.
Also, if this project already uses Zod, and this sentence still exists, simply delete this sentence.

---

OK: Yen.ts
-- The type Yen is the subject.

```typescript
import { z } from 'zod'

const coreSchema = z.number().int().nonnegative()

export const yenSchema = coreSchema.branded('Yen')
export type Yen = z.infer<typeof yenSchema>

// Although number is not the subject,
// since it is a universal property that Yen can be converted (forgotten) to number,
// it is reasonable that toNumber is here.
export function toNumber(yen: Yen): number {
  return coreSchema.parse(yen)
}
```

OK: WorldGroup.ts
-- `World` is not the subject, but it is a concept that depends on `WorldGroup`, so it is OK to put it there.
-- However, if the number of descriptions for `World` increases in this file, please consider splitting the file into World.ts.

```typescript
import { z } from 'zod'

export const worldSchema = z.object({
  uid: z.string(),
  name: z.string(),
  author: z.string(),
  description: z.string(),
  imageUrl: z.string(),
  capacity: z.number(),
  tags: z.array(z.string()),
  publishedAt: z.string(),
  updatedAt: z.string(),
  dataSize: z.number(),
  supportedOS: z.union([
    z.literal('Windows'),
    z.literal('Android'),
    z.literal('iOS'),
  ]),
})
export type World = z.infer<typeof worldSchema>

export const worldGroupSchema = z.object({
  uid: z.string(),
  name: z.string(),
  worlds: z.array(worldSchema),
})
export type WorldGroup = z.infer<typeof worldGroupSchema>
```

NG: FooAndBarItem.ts
-- This should be split into Foo.ts and Bar.ts,
-- and `createBazFromFooAndBar()` should be placed in Baz.ts,
-- or in utils/Baz.ts.

```typescript
import { z } from 'zod'
import type { Baz } from '@/models/Baz'

export const fooSchema = /* some structure */
export type Foo = z.infer<typeof fooSchema>

export const barSchema = /* some structure */
export type Bar = z.infer<typeof barSchema>

export function createBazFromFooAndBar(foo: Foo, bar: Bar): Baz {
  return /* some process that uses foo and bar to create baz */
}
```

#### app/ and components/

- All `components/atoms/**/*.tsx` and `components/molecules/**/*.tsx` should not have state
  - Pass as props if some parameters are needed
- All `components/organisms/**/*.tsx` and `components/templates/**/*.tsx` can have state
  - But if the state is a bigger context, it should be stored in `app/` directory
    - For example, a current page number of some item list, form input values, and else should be stored at here
    - Read bellow instructions that should not be stored at here
- All `app/**/*.tsx` may have state
  - For example, URL queries and responses from backend, and else should be gotten at here

### Naming each component in Atomic Design

'atoms, molecules, organisms, templates' with the respective initials `[amot]` (regex),
the initials 'c' for this project,
If you want to name the simple case Foo,
CaFoo.tsx (when Foo is atoms),
CmFoo.tx (when Foo is a molecule),
CoFoo.tsx (when Foo is an organism),
CtFoo.tsx (when Foo is templates).

### Development Notes

- This project uses atomic design principles for component organization
- In the project, `@/*` points to `. /src/*` path alias

### Component Architecture

- Support for edit mode including select, delete, and move operations
- Uses shadcn/ui components for consistent styling
- Implement responsive design with a mobile-first approach

## Styling with vanilla-extract

This project uses **vanilla-extract** for type-safe CSS-in-JS styling. Key guidelines:

### File Structure

- Create `.css.ts` files alongside components (e.g., `CaButton.tsx` → `CaButton.css.ts`)
- Use the centralized theme system at `src/styles/theme.css.ts`
- Global styles are minimal and located in `src/app/globals.css`

### Theme System

- Use `vars.color.*` for colors (e.g., `vars.color.primary`, `vars.color.background`)
- Use `vars.space.*` for spacing (e.g., `vars.space['2']`, `vars.space['4']`)
- Use `vars.fontSize.*` for font sizes (e.g., `vars.fontSize.sm`, `vars.fontSize.lg`)
- Use `vars.borderRadius.*` for border radius (e.g., `vars.borderRadius.md`)

### Best Practices

- Define component variants using `style()` function
- Use `globalStyle()` for complex selectors (e.g., SVG icons, nested elements)
- Leverage `@media` queries for responsive design
- Import styles as named exports and apply with `className={styles.styleName}`

## Code Style

- Use TypeScript strict mode
- ESLint with Next.js strict settings
- Consistent formatting for more beauty
- Always use English for comments
- Use i18n. English support is preferential. Japanese support is secondary. Also, other languages is not planned yet (PR is welcome!)

## Troubleshooting & Known Issues

### vanilla-extract Configuration Issues

When encountering "Styles were unable to be assigned to a file" errors:

1. **Check vanilla-extract Next.js plugin setup**
   - Ensure `@vanilla-extract/next-plugin` is installed
   - Add to `next.config.ts`:

   ```typescript
   import { createVanillaExtractPlugin } from '@vanilla-extract/next-plugin'
   const withVanillaExtract = createVanillaExtractPlugin()
   export default withVanillaExtract(nextConfig)
   ```

2. **Turbopack vs Webpack compatibility**
   - vanilla-extract may not work properly with Turbopack
   - Use standard Webpack: `next dev` instead of `next dev --turbopack`
   - Update package.json: `"dev": "next dev"`

3. **Theme application verification**
   - Check if `themeClass` is applied to body in `layout.tsx`
   - Verify theme is imported: `import { themeClass } from '@/styles/theme.css'`

### Image Component Migration

When migrating from `<img>` to Next.js `<Image>`:

- Always specify `width` and `height` props
- Import: `import Image from 'next/image'`
- Maintain original styling with `className`
- No visual changes expected, only performance improvements

### ESLint Type Safety Configuration

For shadcn/ui and vanilla-extract compatibility:

- YOU MUST SAVE TYPE SAFETY ~~Consider relaxing strict TypeScript ESLint rules~~
- YOU MUST NOT MODIFY LINT RULES AND TYPESCRIPT CONFIGURATION WITHOUT MY ORDER ~~Add to `eslint.config.mjs`:~~

```javascript
'@typescript-eslint/no-unsafe-assignment': 'off',
'@typescript-eslint/no-unsafe-argument': 'off',
'@typescript-eslint/no-unsafe-call': 'off',
'@typescript-eslint/no-unsafe-member-access': 'off',
'@typescript-eslint/no-unsafe-return': 'off'
```

### Development Workflow Tips

1. **Use TodoWrite for complex tasks**
   - Break down multi-step problems into trackable tasks
   - Mark tasks as in_progress → completed as you work

2. **Visual testing with Playwright**
   - Use `npx playwright test manual-visual-test.spec.ts` for screenshots
   - Check responsive design across different viewports
   - Verify no visual regressions after changes

3. **Import path consistency**
   - Use `@/models` for type imports, not `@/types`
   - Follow the established project structure

4. **Array access safety**
   - Use optional chaining: `array[0]?.property ?? fallback`
   - Prevents runtime errors with empty arrays

5. **Utility function corrections**
   - `clsx(...inputs)` not `clsx(inputs)` for proper spread
   - Check existing utility implementations before debugging
