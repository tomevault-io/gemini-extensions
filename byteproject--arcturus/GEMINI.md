# Arcturus

Arcturus is a high-level interactive-fiction language with its own compiler,
written in Python, that emits standard Z-machine version 5 story files. The
standard library is named Cosmos. The end goal is a complete, hackable IF
toolchain - compiler, editable library, a modern reference interpreter, and an
optional `arc_image` graphics path down to 8-bit machines - validated by porting
existing games to Arcturus: Hibernated 2 (text, the first large real-world game
and the maturity milestone; port complete) and The Curse of Rabenstein (from
DAAD, the graphics testbed). Ghosts of Blackwood Manor was dropped from the
plan once Hibernated 2 proved sufficiency (2026-07-04). Hibernated 2 releases
in its Arcturus build (Stefan's ruling, 2026-07-29). Writing Hibernated 3 stays
Stefan's own goal, pursued separately; this project stays focused on Arcturus
itself.

This file is the standing context for the project. Read it first, then the
three specifications under docs/, which are authoritative.

## Authoritative documents

- docs/00-roadmap.md: charter, locked decisions, milestones, the size
  strategy, and the graphics plan.
- docs/01-arcturus-handbook.md: the Arcturus Handbook, the one author-facing
  book: twenty-six chapters, one topic each, syntax first and library
  behavior after it, technical matter toward the back (the Designer's
  Manual arrangement). The two worked example games (chapters 25 and 26)
  are the conformance anchors. Cite it by chapter ("docs/01 chapter 14").

When code and a document disagree, the document wins: fix the code, or if the
document is wrong, propose the change and update the document in the same
commit.

## Locked decisions

- Target: conformant Z-machine version 5. The `--zversion 8` build flag targets
  version 8 for large modern-only releases; same codegen, only the version byte,
  file-length scale, and packed-address unit (4 to 8) differ.
- Smallest possible z-code is a primary objective, judged alongside
  correctness. Levers in order: whole-program dead-code elimination,
  abbreviation-based text compression, dense codegen (docs/00 section 5).
- The compiler is Python with zero runtime dependencies, so `arcturus` runs on
  a bare interpreter. Tests may use pytest as a dev-only dependency.
- Cosmos is the standard library, written in Arcturus itself and shipped as an
  editable template, not a black box. Overriding is ordinary handler
  resolution: most specific wins, `continue` defers to the next.
- No custom virtual machine, no transpile-to-Inform-6, no PunyInform runtime.
  The compiler emits z5 directly.
- Source extension .storyarc. Compiler binary `arcturus`, short form `arcc`.

## Build, run, test

- Compile: `arcc examples/brass-lantern.storyarc -o build/brass-lantern.z5`
  (z5 by default; `--zversion 8` for version 8).
- arcimg image conversion needs Pillow ON THE MAC (`python3 -m pip install
  --user --break-system-packages pillow`); a Homebrew python upgrade wipes
  keg-installed packages, so if `import PIL` fails after an upgrade,
  reinstall to the user site. ACME (the C64 probe assembler) runs on the
  orb Debian machine from ~/FictionTools, its intended home; never install
  packages or tools in either environment without telling Stefan.
- Test: `pytest`.
- Verify a built story on a reference interpreter (Frotz or Bocfel); the same
  file must also run on Ceres for the 8-bit target.

## Coding standards

- Python 3.11 or later. Standard library only for the compiler runtime.
- Clear module boundaries: lexer, parser, AST, semantic analysis and the
  world-model IR, codegen, z5 story-file assembly, CLI.
- Plain ASCII punctuation in all generated code, comments, and documents. No
  em dashes; use commas, colons, semicolons, parentheses, or shorter
  sentences.
- Every milestone lands with tests and a green done-test before the next.

## Non-goals (do not build these here)

- Disk-image building or BuildTools integration. The project ends at a z5
  file; packaging is handled separately, later, elsewhere.
- A custom VM for running Arcturus games. They emit standard z5 and run on any
  conformant interpreter, so the compiler never ships a runtime. (The Actaea
  reference interpreter and arc_image graphics are their own later milestones,
  B10 to B12, built here but not during the language and library work.)

## Method

- git first: initialize the repo before writing code, and commit per milestone
  with the done-test named in the message.
- Use subagents for tool installation (pytest, a z-machine interpreter for
  testing) so the main thread stays on design and code.
- Work milestone by milestone from docs/00 section 7 (B0 to B13). Each has a
  concrete done-test; do not advance until it passes.
- Produce docs/03-compiler-pipeline.md, docs/04-codegen-mapping.md,
  as the matching work is done (granule additions land in the handbook's
  chapter 22),
  so the design record stays current.

## Conformance

The two example games are the golden tests. The Brass Lantern and Cloak of
Darkness (docs/01 chapters 25 and 26) must compile, run correctly on Frotz,
and run on Ceres, and their story files are tracked for size regression
against a PunyInform-equivalent build.

## Actaea: the reference interpreter (milestone B10, complete)

Actaea is a Standard 1.1 conformant Z-machine interpreter for versions 5 and 8,
written in Python, built in this repo under `actaea/`. It plays any well-formed
story file, not only Arcturus output. docs/06-actaea.md is the official
documentation; actaea/actaea-design.md is the design record (architecture and
the M1 to M11 build milestones, all complete).

- Three front-ends on one headless core behind a hard io boundary: the tkinter
  window (cell-grid status area, styles and colours, menus with persistent
  settings), the curses terminal (`--console`, fizmo-ncursesw manner), and the
  plain pipe (`--headless`, dumb-frotz manner, what scripts and BuildTools
  drive). Both GUI and curses ship inside CPython: zero dependencies holds.
- Scope: z5 and z8 only; full styles and colours; Quetzal saves interoperating
  with Frotz both ways; multiple undo; restart; real transcript files; timed
  input; terminating characters; input preloading. No sound. No v6.
- arc_image is not part of Actaea. It is built later, in this same project, as
  milestones B11 and B12; Actaea keeps the cell model decoupled so that work
  is an extension.
- Conformance: CZECH 406/406 byte-matched, Praxix all-pass, TerpEtude text
  portions, real z5/z8 games, and dfrotz save interop, all in the test suite.
- Distribution: `tools/amalgamate_actaea.py` builds the standalone
  `build/actaea` (same arrangement as arcc); regenerate it whenever the
  interpreter changes, alongside `tools/amalgamate.py` for arcc.
