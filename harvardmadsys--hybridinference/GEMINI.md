# AGENTS.md

This is an onboarding guide for any AI coding agent (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex,
etc.) working in this repository. Read this first.

## 1. About this project

HybridInference is a FastAPI gateway that routes LLM requests across local
inference servers (vLLM, SGLang, Ollama) and remote OpenAI-compatible providers
(DeepSeek, Zhipu, OpenRouter, Anthropic, Gemini, etc.).

- **Repo README:** [README.md](README.md)
- **Developer guide:** [docs/developer/](docs/developer/)

If you are working on a particular deployment, its hosts, accounts and
operational notes live in that deployment's overlay — see
`distributions/<name>/AGENTS.md`. They are deliberately not here: this file
ships with the source, and a URL or credential written into it is published to
everyone who clones the repository.

## 2. Repo map

The layout is in [docs/developer/contributing.md](docs/developer/contributing.md),
under "Repository layout". Two things it does not tell you:

- Deployment overlays under `distributions/` move out of this repository before
  publication. `example/` is the one that remains.
- `distributions/example/` is marked `EXAMPLE_OVERLAY`, and that marker is what
  excludes it from automatic distribution discovery. Select it explicitly
  with `make up DISTRIBUTION=example` to run the local tutorial.

## 3. Getting set up

Prerequisites: Python 3.10–3.13 (3.12 recommended) and [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv).

```bash
make setup-dev
```

The Makefile honors a `UV_RUN` override: `make lint UV_RUN="uv run --active"`.

## 4. Quality gates

`make format`, `make lint`, `make test`, `make all`. Run `make help` for the
full target list.

[docs/developer/contributing.md](docs/developer/contributing.md) is the
canonical reference for the gates and the test tiers.

Pre-commit hooks are installed by `make setup-dev`.

**Before opening a PR:** run `make format` and ensure `make test` passes.

## 5. Workflow

- **Branch off `dev`**, never `main`.
- **Branch naming:** `<user>/<scope>/<feature-name>` (e.g. `jason/claude/add-x`).
- **Use a git worktree** rather than working in the main checkout. Worktree should be put in /tmp/claude/worktree/<feature-name>.
- **PRs target `dev`.**
- **Verify against a running deployment** before claiming done. If you are
  working on one, its staging host and test account are in its overlay guide
  (`distributions/<name>/AGENTS.md`) — never write credentials into this file.

## 6. Project-specific knowledge

### 6.1 Architecture in one diagram

```text
client → FastAPI gateway (serving/) → routing engine (routing/) → adapter → provider
```

For the full diagram (network layer, observability, storage), see
[docs/developer/architecture.md](docs/developer/architecture.md).

### 6.2 Key abstractions

- **Adapter** — provider-specific client. Lives in `apps/backend/serving/adapters/`.
  Dedicated adapters: `openai_compat` (generic OpenAI-compatible APIs — also
  serves local vLLM/SGLang/Ollama), `claude` (Claude via Google Vertex),
  `anthropic` (direct api.anthropic.com), `gemini`, `openrouter`. Local
  inference servers have no dedicated adapter — they route through
  `openai_compat`.
- **`provider` vs `endpoint_id`** — `provider` is a string label on `ModelConfig`
  identifying the API service (used in metrics labels, e.g. `"openai"`,
  `"anthropic"`). `endpoint_id` is the unique per-endpoint key
  (format `{model_id}:{location}`, minted by `registry._make_provider_id` —
  `local-<port>` / `local` for a host in `_LOCAL_HOSTS`, otherwise
  `<service>-api`, e.g. `glm-4.6:local-12003`, `glm-4.6:zai-api`) used for
  latency profiling and availability tracking. The suffix is not a reliable
  ownership signal: a gateway-owned server on a LAN address is stamped
  `<octet>-api`, and an admin-supplied `route_id` becomes the `endpoint_id`
  verbatim. The word "upstream" appears informally in code
  comments meaning "the remote API" but isn't a formal type.
- **Router / HybridRouter abstraction** — the agreed design uses one common
  router contract with independent strategy implementations. Reuse
  [RouterProtocol](apps/backend/routing/protocols.py) as that contract; do not
  create a duplicate interface merely to name it `HybridRouter`. `FixedRouter`
  in [routers.py](apps/backend/routing/routers.py) and `RouteWiseRouter` are
  peer implementations, both able to select across local and cloud candidates.
  Future Greedy/Nimbus routers belong at the same level. Each implementation
  owns its routing, retry and feedback flow; shared helpers need not impose one
  execution loop on every strategy. A separate `RouteWisePolicy` is not required.
  **Naming distinction:** the existing concrete
  [routing.hybrid.HybridRouter](apps/backend/routing/hybrid.py) composes a policy
  with backends; it is not the common interface in the design. Its `FixedPolicy`
  / `BackendSelection` can remain internal or compatibility implementation
  details. Preserve public imports if names change.
  The current bootstrap uses that concrete composition only for mixed
  `router: fixed` models with `router_params.hybrid_composition: true`.
  Other Fixed models retain the shared FixedRouter. The opt-in composition
  still differs in affinity, rejected primary claim re-selection, and fallback
  circuit timing; resolve those before enabling it by default.
  `router: routewise` directly returns RouteWiseRouter. Returning a concrete
  implementation through the common contract is valid; it does not by itself
  prove that the target backend execution boundary is wired.
- **Backend / Leaf** — [backends.py](apps/backend/routing/backends.py) provides
  callable inference capability in one of two shapes. A `LeafBackend` binds the
  **adapter itself, for one endpoint**: it runs that adapter and returns what it
  produced, and it keeps no queue, reservation, health record, failed-attempt
  sample or `_routing` block of its own -- the router that chose the endpoint
  keeps every one of those, and a second copy would double-count them. Its call
  signatures are the adapter's, so a leaf stands in for one adapter wherever an
  adapter is executed. A `TreeBackend` is the entry to a routing subtree and
  delegates to a scoped internal router; `LocalBackend` and `CloudBackend` are
  pools in that sense.
  The instructions are explicit and distinct
  ([dispatch.py](apps/backend/routing/dispatch.py)): `ExecuteEndpoint` binds one
  endpoint through an `EndpointBinding` that carries the resolved adapter, and
  `DelegatePool` grants selection inside a named pool. A mismatch is refused
  before any upstream I/O as a composition error -- never recorded as an
  attempted provider. `FixedRouter` (chat and stream, primary and fallback),
  `RouteWiseRouter` (its decision and both hedge legs) and RouteWise's active
  latency probe all execute through the same leaf, so the selection, admission,
  prefill and feedback accounting stay where they already were.
  **Preserve Fixed and RouteWise request behavior.** RouteWise keeps its full
  candidate pool, reservations, re-solving, hedging, learning and lifecycle,
  using `llm_routewise.core` for algorithm primitives. Do not force it through
  the concrete composition router, a Fixed domain split, or a cloud-only pool.
  `RouteWiseCloudBackend` is an optional scoped compatibility wrapper, not the
  architectural home of RouteWise, and need not be removed for this design.
  Local/cloud ownership is independent of `on_demand`, `quota` and `concurrency`.
  A local GPU deployment can be a concurrency candidate when explicitly
  configured; do not recreate capacity pools per backend or model binding.
  Keep model `router` / `router_params`, defaults, registry caching, aliases and
  Admin switching. Verify in-flight requests and feedback retain their original
  owner across updates; preserving configuration alone is not proof of this.
  Execution scopes currently come from the composition root
  ([hybrid_composition.py](apps/backend/serving/servers/hybrid_composition.py)).
  Explicit `local_scope` / `local_ownership` are supported; bootstrap currently
  uses the hostname default, which can classify an owned LAN or cluster DNS
  endpoint as remote. Do not infer a RouteWise resource type from that domain.
  See
  [docs/agents/specs/2026-09-14-composable-hybrid-routing-design.zh.md](docs/agents/specs/2026-09-14-composable-hybrid-routing-design.zh.md)
  for the current router, leaf and pool contracts, opt-in wiring and deferred work.
- **`routing/executor.py`** — backward-compatibility shim that re-exports
  `FixedRouter` as `RouteExecutor`. **Do not edit it** — edit `routers.py` instead.
- **Strategy** — two layers. The deployment-wide weight strategy
  (`FixedRatioStrategy` in
  [apps/backend/routing/strategies/weight.py](apps/backend/routing/strategies/weight.py))
  is applied by `RoutingManager` in
  [apps/backend/routing/manager.py](apps/backend/routing/manager.py) from
  `config/routing.yaml` (`default_router:`, formerly `routing_strategy:`).
  Per-model router selection (`fixed` / `routewise`) lives in the
  [apps/backend/routing/strategies/](apps/backend/routing/strategies/) package
  and is dispatched by
  [apps/backend/routing/model_router_registry.py](apps/backend/routing/model_router_registry.py)
  from each model's `router:` field in `config/models.yaml`.
- **Circuit breaker / EWMA health** — provider health tracking in
  [apps/backend/routing/](apps/backend/routing/).

### 6.3 Configuration files

| File | Owns |
|---|---|
| `distributions/<name>/config/models.yaml` | Model registry — a deployment's; per-model `router:` / `router_params:` (incl. RouteWise tuning). `config/examples/` has one to start from |
| `distributions/<name>/config/routing.yaml` | Local/remote split, health checks — a deployment's; the gateway starts without one |
| `distributions/<name>/config/alerts.yaml` | Alert rules — a deployment's, not the project's |

YAML supports env var interpolation, in two dialects: the model registry
substitutes only a whole `${VAR}` value, while the routing and alert files also
handle `${VAR:-default}` and variables embedded in longer strings.

### 6.4 Tests: markers and tiers

| Tier | Path | Marker | In default `make test`? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Unit | `tests/unit/` | — | yes |
| API surface | `tests/api/` | — | yes |
| Integration (DB / external) | `tests/integration/` | `dbtest` | no |
| Live external | `tests/external/` | `external` | no |

Opt in to excluded tiers explicitly: `pytest -m dbtest tests/integration/`.

### 6.5 Common gotchas

- Don't commit to `main` or `dev` directly — always branch + PR.
- ALWAYS use a git worktree for development — never work in the main checkout.
- SSE streaming lives in `apps/backend/serving/servers/`. Middleware order
  matters; new middleware that buffers responses will break streaming.
- Storage layer is Postgres (asyncpg), in `apps/backend/serving/storage/`.
  Cloudflare D1 support was removed in #460; `DB_BACKEND` and `DB_DUAL_WRITE`
  are read by no code. There is one SQL dialect — write Postgres.
- Alerting has two permanent, independent paths (decision: issue #1103).
  Backend gateway alerts go through `alert_slack()`
  (`apps/backend/serving/observability/alerts.py`) to a Slack webhook;
  status-monitor alerts go through the status monitor and alert control plane
  workers owned and deployed by the external
  [freeInference repository](https://github.com/HarvardMadSys/freeInference).
  Do not wire backend producers to that control plane.
- Frontend is Next.js in `apps/frontend/` — its quality gates are separate
  from the Python `make` targets.

### 6.6 The cloud agent moved out

The cloud agent lives in
[hybridInference-cloud-agent](https://github.com/HarvardMadSys/hybridInference-cloud-agent).
Production cut over on 2026-08-07 and the H4 removal PR deleted the agent code
from this repository. **All agent work — features, fixes, deploy — happens in
that repository now**; the plan and manifest are in
[docs/agents/plans/2026-08-03-cloud-agent-repo-split.md](docs/agents/plans/2026-08-03-cloud-agent-repo-split.md).

What remains here is the gateway's side of the two service contracts:

- **Identity** — `servers/routers/identity.py` (`/v1/identity/*`).
- **Inference grants** — `serving/grants.py` + `serving/grant_auth.py`,
  `servers/routers/agent_grants.py` (`/internal/agent-grants*`), the
  `/internal/*` lookups (`servers/routers/internal_lookups.py`,
  `serving/model_catalog.py`), and `api_logs.agent_job_id` for cost
  attribution.
- **`/agents` routing** — the console proxies the path to the standalone web
  app via the `AGENT_WEB_INTERNAL_URL` / `AGENT_CONTROL_PLANE_INTERNAL_URL`
  server-only runtime environment (`apps/frontend/src/app/agents/` route
  handler); without either value the path is a 404. The values never enter the
  browser bundle.

The old `agent_*` tables stay in existing databases as read-only history
(decision DR5); nothing here creates, reads or migrates them.

| Run / operate the cloud agent | `docs/operations.md` in [hybridInference-cloud-agent](https://github.com/HarvardMadSys/hybridInference-cloud-agent) |

## 8. Local subsystem guidance

Some durable subsystem ownership boundaries may contain their own `AGENTS.md`.
An agent working inside such a tree must follow the repository-wide guidance
here and every applicable ancestor guide along the path. A nested guide
supplements its ancestors; it does not override repository-wide workflow or
quality rules.

Nested guidance is intentionally sparse. Create it only where ownership,
load-bearing invariants, staged migration, specialized verification, or
repeated cross-boundary mistakes justify a local contract. It is not required
for every package or directory. Possible future candidates include serving,
storage, adapters, and frontend, but this index does not mandate guides there.

Subsystem guides describe ownership, non-ownership, durable invariants,
cross-boundary edit expectations, verification categories, and pointers to
dated design or implementation records. They do not duplicate full
architecture specs, implementation plans, exhaustive file maps, or current
call graphs.

Keep the records distinct: specs capture a proposed or decided target at a
point in time, plans describe a staged migration, and reviews preserve evidence
of what was actually verified. None of these layers is replaced by a nested
guide.

Current implementation is not automatically target architecture. When a
subsystem is under revision, its guide must say so and agents must consult the
newest applicable records in [`docs/agents/specs/`](docs/agents/specs/),
[`docs/agents/plans/`](docs/agents/plans/), and
[`docs/reviews/`](docs/reviews/) before broad changes. When an accepted
architecture changes, create a new dated design record or explicitly supersede
the applicable prior record. Update a subsystem guide only when its ownership,
invariants, edit rules, or verification contract changes.

### Subsystem guidance index

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`apps/backend/routing/`](apps/backend/routing/AGENTS.md) | Pilot guidance for the routing ownership boundary |
