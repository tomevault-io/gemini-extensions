# Swarm Orchestrator - Agent Memory

## March 2026 Failure Remediation (v4.0.0 → v4.1.0)

**Incident:** Sprint 2 Deferred Remediation campaign (March 4, 2026) — 5 failure categories, ~50% efficiency.

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (Implemented)
| Fix | Addresses | What it does |
|-----|-----------|-------------|
| **R1: Campaign Locking** | F1, F3 | File lock at `/dev/shm/{swarmId}.lock` prevents duplicate concurrent runs. 30-min stale threshold. |
| **R2: Per-Task Timeout** | F2 | `timeoutSeconds` field on each task. Tiers: quickEdit=120s, analysis=300s, heavyIO=900s, buildTest=600s. |
| **R6: Stderr Capture** | F6 | Bridge script falls back to stderr when stdout is empty. Eliminates zero-length output successes. |

### Phase 2: Reliability (Implemented)
| Fix | Addresses | What it does |
|-----|-----------|-------------|
| **R3: Post-Mutation Verification** | F5 | `expectedMutations` array on tasks. After task success, verifies files contain expected strings. Fails task if not. |
| **R4: Startup Preflight** | F1 | `preflight()` validates task structure, duplicate IDs, executor bridges, API creds, DAG deps, cycles, memory. Fails fast with diagnostics. |
| **R7: Prompt Reinforcement** | F5 | Appends "IMPORTANT: This task requires ACTUAL FILE CHANGES" + file list to prompts when `expectedMutations` is set. |

### Phase 3: UX (Implemented)
| Fix | Addresses | What it does |
|-----|-----------|-------------|
| **R5: Async Completion Notification** | F4 | Writes `/dev/shm/{swarmId}-complete.json` on finish (always). Optionally sends SMS or email via `--notify sms` or `--notify email`. User is informed regardless of chat session state. |

### Campaign JSON Example (post-remediation)
```json
{
  "id": "s2-compression-middleware",
  "persona": "claude-code",
  "task": "Add compression middleware to server/index.ts",
  "priority": "high",
  "timeoutSeconds": 120,
  "expectedMutations": [
    { "file": "/home/workspace/verdant-goods-store/server/index.ts", "contains": "compression()" },
    { "file": "/home/workspace/verdant-goods-store/package.json", "contains": "\"compression\"" }
  ]
}
```

## Lessons Learned from Production Failures

### February 2026 Incident Analysis

**Context:** Attempted to use swarm orchestrator for a multi-page website review with 5 agents simultaneously.

**What Failed:**
1. All parallel API calls timed out (120s insufficient)
2. No retry mechanism caused complete failure
3. Rate limiting from concurrent requests
4. Context window pressure with 256k tokens × 5 agents

**What Worked:**
1. Direct sequential API calls succeeded
2. Smaller, focused tasks completed successfully
3. Python subprocess approach was reliable
4. Bun/TypeScript orchestrator script logic was sound

**Root Causes Identified:**
- API calls had implicit rate limits per session (resolved: now local-only)
- Complex analysis requires >120s timeout
- No backoff strategy caused thundering herd
- Missing circuit breaker allowed cascading failures

## Memory Integration (v4.5.0)

As of v4.5.0, the orchestrator integrates with zo-memory-system for learning and adaptive routing:

| Feature | Implementation | Benefit |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| Auto-Episodes | `createSwarmEpisode()` at end of `run()` | Every swarm run becomes a queryable event |
| 6-Signal Routing | `compositeRoute()` adds procedure + temporal | Routes learn from past success/failure |
| Cognitive Profiles | Extended `executor-history.json` | Episode IDs, failure patterns, entity affinities |
| Error Classification | Auto-classify: timeout, mutation_failed, file_not_found | Failure patterns inform routing avoidance |
| Entity Affinities | Exponential moving average per entity per executor | Tracks which executors excel at which domains |

### Composite Router Signals (v4.5)

```
composite = (w.capability * capScore)     # Task-capability matching
           + (w.health * hlth)            # Circuit breaker health
           + (w.complexityFit * cfit)     # Complexity tier affinity
           + (w.history * hist)           # Historical success rate
           + (0.10 * (procScore - 0.5))   # Procedure success bonus (±0.05)
           + (0.05 * (tempScore - 0.5))   # Recent episodic bonus (±0.025)
```

### Querying Swarm History

```bash
# Recent swarm episodes
bun ~/Skills/zo-memory-system/scripts/memory.ts episodes --entity "swarm.ffb" --since "7 days ago"

# Executor cognitive profile
bun ~/Skills/zo-memory-system/scripts/memory.ts profile --executor gemini

# Procedure evolution
bun ~/Skills/zo-memory-system/scripts/memory.ts procedures --evolve "site-review"
```

## Architecture (v4.6.0 — Local Executors + OmniRoute Failover)

Primary path: all tasks execute via local executor bridges (claude-code, hermes, gemini, codex).
When all local executors exhaust retries, OmniRoute provides API-level failover through a
priority combo that chains multiple providers (paid → free tiers).

```
v4.4 (local only)              v4.6 (local + OmniRoute failover)
─────────────────              ─────────────────────────────────
1 execution path               2 execution paths
  - Local executor only          - Local executor (primary)
                                 - OmniRoute API failover (last resort)
On failure: retry same          On failure: retry local → reroute local → OmniRoute
  or reroute to different         combo with provider-level failover
  local executor
```

### OmniRoute Integration (v4.6)

OmniRoute runs at `http://localhost:20128` and exposes an OpenAI-compatible `/v1` endpoint.
The `swarm-failover` combo provides priority-based provider failover.

**Flow:**
1. Task routed to best local executor (composite router)
2. On failure → reroute to next-best local executor (existing behavior)
3. All local retries exhausted → **OmniRoute fallback** via `swarm-failover` combo
4. OmniRoute tries providers in priority order (e.g. Anthropic → OpenAI → free tiers)

**Environment variables:**
| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `SWARM_OMNIROUTE_ENABLED` | `true` | Set to `false` to disable OmniRoute fallback |
| `SWARM_OMNIROUTE_URL` | `http://localhost:20128/v1/chat/completions` | OmniRoute endpoint |
| `SWARM_OMNIROUTE_MODEL` | `swarm-failover` | Combo name to use |
| `SWARM_OMNIROUTE_API_KEY` | (from OmniRoute/.env) | API key (auto-resolved from `API_KEY_SECRET` in OmniRoute/.env) |

**Important:** OmniRoute is a text-only API fallback. It cannot execute tools, read files, or
run commands. Tasks that require file mutations will likely fail via OmniRoute. It's most useful
for analysis, review, and synthesis tasks.

**Preflight:** The orchestrator checks OmniRoute reachability during preflight. If unreachable,
`omniRouteEnabled` is automatically set to `false` for that run (non-blocking warning).

### Key Features

| Feature | Implementation | Benefit |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| Local Executors | Bridge scripts (bash) | No API latency, full local control |
| OmniRoute Failover | HTTP POST to `/v1/chat/completions` | API-level provider failover as last resort |
| DAG Streaming | Promise.race loop | Tasks start immediately when deps resolve |
| Circuit Breaker | `failures >= 2` | Prevents cascading failures |
| Priority Queue | Sort by critical/high/medium/low | Important tasks complete first |
| Structured Logging | NDJSON output with timing | Debuggability |
| Task Validation | Preflight checks | Fail fast on invalid input |

## Configuration Presets

### Safe Default (Recommended)
```bash
SWARM_LOCAL_CONCURRENCY=4
TIMEOUT_SECONDS=300
MAX_RETRIES=3
```

### Aggressive (Development Only)
```bash
SWARM_LOCAL_CONCURRENCY=6
TIMEOUT_SECONDS=180
MAX_RETRIES=2
```

### Conservative (Critical Production)
```bash
SWARM_LOCAL_CONCURRENCY=2
TIMEOUT_SECONDS=600
MAX_RETRIES=5
```

## When to Use Which Version

### Use v1 When:
- Quick analysis with 2-3 simple tasks
- Development/testing environment
- Low stakes, fast iteration needed
- Tasks are independent and simple

### Use v2 When:
- Production critical workflows
- 4+ agents needed
- Complex multi-step reasoning required
- Tasks have dependencies or priorities
- Reliability is more important than speed

## Known Limitations

### Local Executor Constraints
- Concurrency limited by machine resources (CPU/memory)
- Each executor bridge runs as a child process
- All tasks must have a registered local executor (no API fallback)

### Workarounds
- Adjust `localConcurrency` based on machine capacity
- Break complex tasks into smaller subtasks
- Use task timeouts to prevent runaway processes

## Success Patterns

### Pattern 1: Sequential Fallback
When swarm fails, fall back to sequential execution:
```typescript
// Try swarm first
const result = await swarm.execute(tasks).catch(() => {
  // Fallback: process sequentially
  return sequentialProcess(tasks);
});
```

### Pattern 2: Task Decomposition
Break complex tasks into smaller chunks:
```json
[
  {"task": "Analyze hero section", "priority": "high"},
  {"task": "Analyze product cards", "priority": "high"},
  {"task": "Analyze footer", "priority": "medium"}
]
```

### Pattern 3: Priority Tiers
Always structure tasks by priority:
1. **Critical** - Security, compliance, broken functionality
2. **High** - SEO, performance, UX issues
3. **Medium** - Accessibility, enhancements
4. **Low** - Nice-to-have improvements

## Monitoring & Alerting

### Metrics to Track
- Swarm success rate (target: >95%)
- Average task duration (target: <60s)
- Retry rate (target: <10%)
- Circuit breaker triggers (alert if >2/persona)

### Log Locations
- Results: `/tmp/swarm-results/*.json`
- Analysis: `$HOME/.swarm/results/`

## Future Improvements

### Short Term
- [ ] Add request caching for identical tasks
- [ ] Implement request queue with deduplication
- [ ] Add cost tracking per swarm invocation

### Long Term
- [ ] Persistent swarm memory across sessions
- [ ] Visual dashboard for real-time monitoring
- [ ] Automatic task decomposition based on complexity
- [ ] A/B testing framework for v1 vs v2
