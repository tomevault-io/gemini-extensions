# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

p64 is a desktop 64x64 RGB LED matrix: Waveshare's ESP32-S3-RGB-Matrix driver board
plugged onto their RGB-Matrix-P2-64x64 panel, in a 3D-printed tabletop shell. Three
folders of work live here, each with its own README that is the detailed reference:

- `firmware/`: the p64 product firmware, started from zero on 2026-09-19. Its behaviour is
  fixed by the product specification `docs/spec/p64-spec.md` (settled with the user on
  2026-09-19, settings and limits tables included) and the decisions in `docs/adr/`; the
  vocabulary is `CONTEXT.md`. Its design is `firmware/docs/architecture.md`, its state of
  progress `firmware/docs/PROGRESS.md` (read that first when resuming), its API
  `firmware/docs/api.md`. The "Firmware" section below has the commands. Do not carry
  code or patterns over from the hardware tests on your own initiative.
- `firmware/reference/hardware-tests/`: the former `firmware/` (renamed on 2026-09-19,
  moved under `firmware/reference/` on 2026-09-24; git history follows both moves,
  `git log --follow` works on its files): ESP-IDF v5.5 test firmware, C++20,
  directly on the `esphome/esp-hub75` DMA driver (vendored and patched under
  `firmware/reference/hardware-tests/components/esp-hub75`). No Arduino, no LVGL, no Waveshare BSP (only
  its pin map was reused). It is the technical reference for the product firmware (what
  the hardware taught: pin map, driver patch, frame pacing, GDMA, network, microSD), not
  its architectural reference. The "Hardware tests" sections below describe it.
- `enclosure/`: the OpenSCAD shell, versioned as separate `.scad` files with outputs
  under `enclosure/output/vN/`.
- `docs/video/`: the p64b concept video pipeline (2026-09-24): `pieces.scad` exports the
  enclosure source's mock-ups, `bake_leds.py` the panel frames, `scene.py` builds and
  renders in Blender 5.2 (Cycles, GPU), `compose.py` adds bloom, captions and the end
  card, `storyboard.py` holds every time; `make.ps1` runs it all. `build/` and the MP4s
  are git-ignored; its README has the steps.
- `docs/hardware/`: wiring projects for the two rotary encoders of p64b
  (`encoders-solderless.md`, `encoders-soldered.md`, schematics drawn by
  `tools/draw_encoders.py` with schemdraw),
  written 2026-09-21 before any encoder was wired; the bench records in them are blank
  until measured.

The repository README is written for newcomers (what p64 is, photos under `docs/images/photos/`,
the parts list with dated Waveshare prices, an honest status) and `docs/build-your-own.md`
is the step-by-step build guide; keep both truthful when the status changes (first
release, v7 printed, encoders wired).

p64 has two variants, supported for good (decided 2026-09-22): **p64a**, solder-less,
without rotary encoders; **p64b**, with soldering, with the two rotary encoders. The
enclosure has one source and two variant files (`enclosure/src/p64_enclosure_v7a.scad`
and `_v7b.scad`), outputs under `enclosure/output/p64a/` and `p64b/`; the firmware is
shared. Anything new that touches the encoders is a p64b matter.

Also: `firmware/reference/` is git-ignored upstream clones (the one tracked exception is
`hardware-tests/`, above): Waveshare's example repo,
`p3a/` (the user's production ESP32-P4 pixel-art player, github.com/fabkury/p3a, the
reference for module boundaries, web UI and Makapix client) and `makapix/` (the Makapix
Club server, github.com/fabkury/makapix, the device contract in its `docs/player/` and
`docs/mqtt-api/`); re-clone commands are in `firmware/README.md`. `firmware/private/` is
the **private area** (ADR 0012, since 2026-09-24): a separate, unpublished repository,
github.com/fabkury/p64-private, mounted there and git-ignored here (a local pre-commit
hook refuses its paths); the user's own components, first a private source of channels.
The public build discovers it when present (`firmware/CMakeLists.txt`: components,
`sdkconfig.private`, version `+private`; `main.cpp` calls `p64::priv::start()` under
`CONFIG_P64_PRIVATE`; `tests/host/run.py` reads its manifest) and is the public firmware
without it, which is what CI builds; `tools\idf.ps1 -B build_public -DP64_NO_PRIVATE=ON
build` checks that parity locally. Nothing public may depend on it (no public symbol
whose only user is private), and its RAM costs are measured by hand. Channel sources
other than the card reach the show only through `content::Provider`
(`p64/content/provider.hpp`, the registry, kind `external` = `<provider>:<channel>`);
Makapix Club is the first provider and the private source is written as the second.
`prompt/pNNN-*.txt` are the user's task
prompts, one per session, committed (public work only, see below). `enclosure/archive/2026-09-dhruv-solidworks/` is a
friend's separate SolidWorks work: never edit it. `enclosure/inbox/` is an untracked
staging area for incoming material; do not commit it unless asked.

## Firmware

ESP-IDF v5.5.4, C++20, components under `firmware/components/` (`p64_gfx`, `p64_decode`,
`p64_display`, `p64_system`, `p64_playback`, `p64_storage`, `p64_content`, `p64_net`,
`p64_web`,
`p64_makapix`, vendored `esp-hub75` with the p64 patch, `animatedgif`, `libpng`, `libwebp`)
`p64_makapix`, `p64_widgets`, `p64_stream`, `p64_inputs`, `p64_ota`) and the application in `firmware/main/` (`main.cpp`
wiring, `show.cpp` the state machine, `loader.cpp` the card I/O worker). Milestones M0
to M8 are done (2026-09-19): display, decoders, storage, settings, Wi-Fi with setup
mode, API v1 with WebSocket and web UI, the content model (playsets, channels,
scheduler, history), Makapix Club (pairing, indexes, cache, MQTT commands, views, likes;
the development device is paired as player 7e983c9a...), the widgets (bundled
fonts via `tools/gen_fonts.py`, clock overlay, clock, weather with icons via
`tools/gen_weather_icons.py`, SHTC3 temperature, interludes, main states) and the
streams (DDP on UDP 4048, raw p64 on UDP 4064, takeover with the silence timeout;
`tools/stream_send.py` sends). M9 is in progress: reliability (reset counters, core dump
summary, deferred image confirmation), night schedule, factory reset (API and BOOT
hold), the IMU (taps, auto-rotation with an upright calibration), the PIN (route
gate, sessions, lockout) and OTA (GitHub releases, SHA256-verified install, rollback)
are done, and M10 delivered the web UI in p3a's layout and five themes
(`components/p64_web/ui/`: four pages, the shared static files, the setup portal on the
same stylesheet), the unattended soak harness and the docs, so M0 to M10 are complete;
the analogue clock face followed on 2026-09-20; open: the acceptance measurements that
need instruments, long soaks, the hands-on checks;
`firmware/docs/PROGRESS.md` has the table and the log with what was verified on the
device.

Commands, all from `firmware/` in PowerShell 7 (same scripts as the hardware tests):
`.\tools\build.ps1`, `.\tools\flash.ps1` (auto-detects COM13), `.\tools\monitor.ps1`,
`.\tools\idf.ps1 <args>`. Non-interactive console reads: `tools\serial_peek.py COM13
<seconds>` with the IDF venv's python (`C:\Espressif\tools\python\v5.5.4\venv`); it does
not reset the board, so to capture a boot log keep it open while
`POST /api/v1/action/reboot` restarts the firmware. Tests: `python tests\host\run.py`
(host build of the ESP-IDF-free files: the doctest cases under `tests\host\unit\` plus
the image corpora checked pixel-exact against Pillow; needs gcc/g++ and the system Python
with Pillow; `--tc "show*"` runs matching cases, `--werror`, `--sanitize` (Linux/WSL
only) and `--junit FILE` are what CI uses). GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/firmware.yml`)
runs the host tests with ASan, UBSan and `-Werror` and the ESP-IDF build with
`tools\check_size.py` on every push to main; warnings in p64 code are errors in the
firmware build too (`firmware/CMakeLists.txt`). Device tests:
`python tests\device\api_smoke.py http://<ip> [--corpus]`,
`python tests\device\content_smoke.py http://<ip>` and
`python tests\device\makapix_smoke.py http://<ip> [--paired]`,
`python tests\device\widgets_smoke.py http://<ip>`,
`python tests\device\stream_smoke.py http://<ip>` and
`python tests\device\ops_smoke.py http://<ip>` and
`python tests\device\imu_smoke.py http://<ip>` and
`python tests\device\pin_smoke.py http://<ip>` and
`python tests\device\ota_smoke.py http://<ip> [--no-install]` and
`python tests\device\ui_smoke.py http://<ip>` and
`python tests\device\panel_mode_smoke.py http://<ip>` and
`python tests\device\timing_smoke.py http://<ip>` (playback cadence, spec 18.4) and
`python tests\device\ws_smoke.py http://<ip>` (the WebSocket push held open) and
`python tests\device\cache_sweep_smoke.py http://<ip> [--delete]` against the live device, and
`python tests\device\soak.py http://<ip> --minutes N` for an unattended acceptance soak (the
development device answers at http://p64.local; its IP is in the boot log; give the
timing-sensitive tests the IP, since the first mDNS lookup of a process can take 3 s).

Facts that bite: `sdkconfig.defaults` is the source of truth and a changed default needs
`firmware/sdkconfig` deleted; Wi-Fi credentials live only in the git-ignored
`firmware/sdkconfig.secrets` (`CONFIG_P64_DEV_WIFI_SSID/PASSWORD`, seeded into NVS when
NVS has none) and are never echoed into summaries; `CONFIG_SPIRAM_MALLOC_ALWAYSINTERNAL`
is 1024 (since 2026-09-22; the Wi-Fi driver's hot code and the FreeRTOS kernel also live
in flash), and anything large or long-lived (frames, indexes, task stacks of I/O tasks)
is placed in PSRAM explicitly; the core-1 idle watchdog is off on purpose (a slow
artwork keeps the player busy by design); both playback tasks live on core 1, all
network and storage tasks on core 0; the main task is the show loop and never does card
I/O. Internal RAM is the scarce resource: with the Makapix MQTT session up the heap
sits at 75 to 80 KB free (largest block 45 KB) since the review of 2026-09-22
(`docs/review-2026-09/`), and `firmware/budgets.json` holds the floors (48 KB free, 32 KB
largest); anything new that wants internal RAM (a task stack, a TLS session, a buffer)
must be measured on the device (`GET /api/v1/diag/memory`, `tools\cpu_sample.py`) before
it is kept. Rules that bugs have lived in go into pure files beside the code that uses
them and get host tests: the show is `main/show_core.cpp` behind the `ShowEnv` interface
(`show.cpp` is only the shell; scenario tests drive the core with a fake env), and the
pure halves elsewhere are `p64/playback/timing.hpp`, `settings_model.cpp`,
`p64_makapix/src/contract.cpp` and `policy.cpp`, `p64_web/src/auth_rules.cpp`,
`p64_ota/src/release.cpp`, `p64_widgets/src/faces.cpp`, `p64_net/src/time_rules.cpp`, and the driver's
`src/platforms/gdma/p64_bcm.h`. New logic goes into those, not into the shells. A task whose stack is in PSRAM
(`xTaskCreatePinnedToCoreWithCaps`) must never touch the SPI flash (NVS, partitions,
OTA, core dump): the flash driver asserts and the device reboots. Every NVS access is
wrapped in `system::on_internal_stack()` (`p64/system/flash_guard.hpp`); wrap any new
one, and build status documents from RAM copies only. Time is trusted only once NTP has answered in this boot (ADR 0011, since 2026-09-23): the
RTC has no battery and no driver, there is no manual set; read the time only through
`net::clock::now_utc()`/`local_time()` or behind `clock::synced()`, never `time()` directly,
and never store or compare a date before that. After an OTA install the device boots from
`ota_1` while `flash.ps1` writes `ota_0`: roll back from the Update card (or run
`tests\device\ota_smoke.py`, which ends with a rollback) before trusting a flash.
The panel modes are refresh profiles of the vendored driver (Quality 10 planes at
271 Hz, Photo 8 planes at 814 Hz, switched in place inside descriptor arrays allocated
once at boot); a mode switch must never allocate internal RAM, and the plane
output-enable windows must stay superincreasing or the LUT fit collapses (both bitten
on 2026-09-20, `firmware/docs/PROGRESS.md`).

## Hardware tests: commands

All from `firmware/reference/hardware-tests/`, in PowerShell 7 (the scripts dot-source
ESP-IDF themselves):

```
.\tools\build.ps1              # idf.py build
.\tools\flash.ps1              # build if needed + flash, auto-detects the board's COM port
.\tools\flash.ps1 -Monitor     # then open the serial console (Ctrl+] quits)
.\tools\monitor.ps1            # console only
.\tools\erase.ps1              # erase the whole flash
.\tools\port.ps1               # print the board's COM port
.\tools\idf.ps1 <args>         # any idf.py command, e.g. menuconfig, size-components
```

There are no unit tests; verification is flashing and reading the serial log. The board
logs a per-phase line with average fps, copy/wait/render times and sync counters.

Environment facts that bite:

- ESP-IDF v5.5.4 is the EIM install at `C:\esp\v5.5.4\esp-idf`, tools in
  `C:\Espressif\tools` (an older v5.5.2 classic install also exists; do not use it).
  `tools/env.ps1` holds the paths.
- `idf_tools.py` and friends refuse to run under Git Bash ("MSys/Mingw is not
  supported"): use the PowerShell tool for anything ESP-IDF.
- The board is native USB Serial/JTAG (VID 303A, PID 1001), COM13 on this laptop; the
  machine also has several Bluetooth COM ports, so always pass or detect an explicit
  port. To capture a boot log non-interactively, open the port with pyserial (dtr/rts
  false) and read; `idf.py monitor` wants a TTY. Pulsing `rts` true for 0.1 s did not
  reset the board on 2026-09-15; what worked was keeping the port open and reading
  while `GET /debug/reboot` restarts the firmware (no lines lost).
- `sdkconfig.defaults` is the source of truth (board, panel, pins, driver options);
  `sdkconfig` is generated and ignored. `dependencies.lock` is committed. Wi-Fi
  credentials live only in the git-ignored `sdkconfig.secrets` of that folder (template:
  `sdkconfig.secrets.example`), applied by the project CMakeLists on top of the
  defaults; never write them anywhere else, and never echo the SSID or password
  into a summary (the Wi-Fi driver's own log lines print the SSID).
- Full white at brightness 255 draws close to the panel's 15 W rating; the 27 W supply
  goes on the POWER port, the laptop on the USB port. `P64_MAX_BRIGHTNESS` (menu "p64")
  caps every scene for laptop-only sessions.

## Hardware tests: architecture

`main.cpp` runs an array of `Scene`s in a loop (BOOT button skips ahead). The one scene,
`GifShowScene`, plays a random card GIF at boot (read directly in `enter()`, before the
loop runs), swaps to the first Makapix download the instant it lands, then to a fresh
download every 30 s or as soon as the next lands when late; nothing is embedded in the
binary any more and nothing but fresh downloads plays after the startup GIF (offline: the
current artwork stays up, the scene re-requests every 5 s). A `Scene`
(`scene.hpp`) implements `enter()` (must present its first frame) and `render()`, which
draws into a RAM `Frame` (RGB888, `display.hpp`) and returns whether the frame changed.
`Display` owns the `Hub75Driver`, builds its config entirely from `CONFIG_HUB75_*`, and
`present()` copies the frame in with one `draw_pixels()` call and flips.

The non-obvious part is frame pacing (`display.cpp`). The driver's `flip_buffer()` only
relinks the DMA descriptor chain; the DMA finishes the old front buffer first and gives
no signal. `Display` finds the LCD GDMA channel (`out.peri_sel == LCD`), learns the last
descriptor of both chains at start-up, clears the channel's end-of-frame flag before each
flip, and `wait_for_back_buffer()` sleeps until just before the predicted boundary, spins
on the flag, then checks that `dscr` has left the chain that was front (identified at flip
time from `dscr` itself: `eof_des_addr` lags one frame behind a switch and named the wrong
chain whenever two presents came within a frame, as at every artwork transition, after
which every wait ran into its timeout; testing against "the chain that just ended" breaks
as soon as presents are sparse). The loop is therefore locked to the panel refresh
(271.3 Hz: 10 bit planes at 20 MHz with the five lowest sent once per frame, see the
driver patch below; 32 MHz needs software TLS crypto, see the GDMA lesson below):
render into RAM right after `present()`,
then `wait_for_back_buffer()`, then `present()`. Keep that order, and keep the wait
blocking at least occasionally (it does), otherwise the idle task starves and the task
watchdog fires. Scenes return "dirty" only when something changed; unchanged frames are
not re-presented. Measured: 6.9 ms per `draw_pixels()` for 64x64 with 10 planes (5.8 ms
with 8), so the copy is the cost to watch before any faster refresh. The main task runs on core 1
(`ESP_MAIN_TASK_AFFINITY_CPU1`), Wi-Fi and lwIP on core 0.
Changing `sdkconfig.defaults` or `sdkconfig.secrets` does not touch an existing
generated `sdkconfig`: delete the folder's `sdkconfig` (or use menuconfig) for a changed
default to take effect.

Driver: `esp-hub75` 0.3.6 is vendored under `components/esp-hub75` of that folder with a patch
("p64 patch" markers, listed in its `P64-CHANGES.md`): planes at or below the driver's
transition bit get halving output-enable windows so `HUB75_MIN_REFRESH_RATE` no longer
collapses the levels (upstream gave them equal weight), the LUT is refitted to the real
on-times, the gamma 2.2 table is fixed (upstream mapped black to white), and getters
expose frame period, descriptor count and transition bit (Display relies on them).
Current setting 10 bits, minimum 250 Hz -> transition 4, 271.3 Hz, 1024 codes (plane 0
on a 50 ns pulse); the reasoning, the numbers and the neighbouring settings are in
its README "Tonal depth and refresh". The
released driver lacks things present on its git main (no `row_decoder`; `ICN2038S` is a
distinct enumerator). Brightness 0 blanks the panel; 1-255 go through a curve floored at
~17/255 on a 64-wide panel, and any value below 255 now costs the low planes first.

Makapix Club (`main/net/makapix.*`): a fetcher task on core 0 does two anonymous
HTTPS GETs per artwork (`/api/post?promoted=true&sort=random&limit=1&width_max=..&
height_max=..&file_format=gif` with `P64_MAKAPIX_MAX_DIMENSION`, default 64; the API
also takes `width_min`/`height_min`; then `/api/d/{sqid}.gif`), gated on Wi-Fi and NTP
(TLS needs the clock), handing bytes to the scene under a mutex. The server code is
github.com/fabkury/makapix (the user's own); `api/openapi.json` there is the contract.

Web control (`main/net/web.*`): `esp_http_server` on port 80 plus mDNS (`espressif/mdns`,
hostname `p64` -> p64.local). `/play?post=<Makapix URL or sqid>|url=<GIF URL>[&seconds=N]`
answers 202 at once and queues a `makapix::PlayRequest` (`/pattern` holds a tone test
pattern, `/stop` ends either; `file=<name>` plays a card file); the fetcher task serves those
ahead of the rotation (one TLS session at a time, on purpose: two at once ran internal
RAM out before), validates the GIF header and size (`P64_WEB_MAX_BYTES`,
`P64_WEB_MAX_DIMENSION`), and the scene picks the result up with `take_play()`,
pre-empting the 30 s slot until the time is up, `/stop`, or the next request (0 s =
indefinite). The scene publishes `web::NowPlaying` for `/status`. No authentication.

microSD card (`main/sdcard.*`): SDMMC 1-bit on CLK 1 / CMD 44 / D0 17 (the SDMMC host has
its own DMA, so card traffic did not disturb the panel), FAT at `/sdcard`, long file
names, formatted to FAT32 automatically when a card has no FAT (`P64_SD_FORMAT_IF_MOUNT_FAILED`).
GIFs live in the card's root. The web module owns the file endpoints (`/sd`, `PUT|GET|DELETE
/sd/<name>`, `/sd/play` playlist, `/sd/mount`); card reads for playback go through the
fetcher task (`PlayRequest::file`), never the rendering task. No card-detect line: a swapped
card needs `/sd/mount`.

Debug endpoints (`P64_DEBUG_ENDPOINTS`, on): `/debug` (panel health via `Display::health()`,
GDMA priority, timing), `/debug/dma?priority=N` (live), `/debug/stress[?loops=N]` (runs
`speedtest::run_now()`), `/debug/reboot`. `Display::instance()` gives the web module the
one Display.

Network: `sdkconfig.defaults` sets a 64 KB TCP window, lwIP buffers in PSRAM and
mbedTLS buffers internal + dynamic; measured numbers and the reasoning are in
its README "Network throughput". `P64_SPEEDTEST` (menuconfig, off) runs a
download test 45 s after boot and logs it; it downloads ~12 MB, so never leave it on.
Makapix Club is ~220 ms away and its throughput is erratic (20-220 KB/s); that is the
path, not the device.

GDMA lesson (2026-09-12, resolved 2026-09-13): the panel's LCD_CAM FIFO has no
back-pressure, so its GDMA channel must never lose arbitration for longer than the FIFO
lasts. The hardware AES/SHA engines also stream through GDMA, and with every channel at
priority 0 their bursts starved the panel at 32 MHz (descriptor pointer frozen, OUT_DONE
set, no EOF; only a reboot recovers). Fix: the vendored driver sets the panel channel to
GDMA priority 5 (`HUB75_GDMA_PRIORITY`); measured at 32 MHz under three passes of the
speed test with hardware crypto: zero timeouts, unchanged throughput, while priority 0
stalled within 2.6 s. The clock is 20 MHz by choice (LED pulse widths), not necessity.
The SD host has its own DMA and never disturbed the panel. Any new GDMA user (SPI, I2S)
should be checked with `/debug/stress` and `/debug`. Things that do not help: reserving
the panel pair's receive channel; restarting the Hub75Driver in place. `Display` logs
"panel DMA stalled" once when it detects the frozen pointer; `/debug` shows the flag.

GIF playback (`main/gif_player.*`): bitbank2/AnimatedGIF, vendored as
`components/animatedgif` of that folder (Apache-2.0, one documented local patch), used in
`GIF_DRAW_RAW` mode with an RGB888 palette; `GifPlayer` composites the lines it gets
into an RGB888 canvas (transparency, all four disposal modes, black background) and
`Scaler` fits the canvas into 64x64 (nearest up, box-average down, black bars).
`gif_player.*` must stay free of ESP-IDF includes: `tools/gifcheck/gifcheck.py` builds
it natively with the harness in that folder and compares every frame of every GIF in
`firmware/tests/host/corpus/gifs/` (the 64 Makapix GIFs that were this folder's
`assets/gifs/` until 2026-09-24, shared with the product firmware's host tests) against
Pillow, pixel-exact; run it after touching the decoder, the compositor, the scaler, or
the corpus. The corpus is also the set the README's copy loop uploads to the card; it is
not embedded in the firmware.

Orientation: the firmware drives the panel in native orientation (`ROTATE_0`): row 63 is
the native bottom, and the controller's USB-C ports sit behind the native right edge. The
enclosure turns the panel 90 degrees clockwise (front view); the matching setting is
`CONFIG_HUB75_ROTATE_90`, to be switched on when the shell is in use.

Style: the folder's `.clang-format` (Google, 2 spaces, 120 columns), same as the driver.

## Enclosure

OpenSCAD. **v7 is the design** (`src/p64_enclosure_v7.scad`, the whole geometry), rendered
through two three-line variant files that include it and set `encoders`:
`src/p64_enclosure_v7a.scad` (p64a, no encoders, outputs in `output/p64a/v7a/`) and
`src/p64_enclosure_v7b.scad` (p64b, two encoders, `output/p64b/v7b/`). Render the variant
files, never the source, so a change is made once and both folders are regenerated. What
v7 is: two small 90-degree USB-C adapters stay on the controller's ports behind one window
in the back face, sized by a named tolerance budget (the port position is only known to
+-1 mm, from a photo; the frame's own wall bounds the downward side), a hand-cut notch in
the panel frame's back plate, the seating ledge relieved below the ports, and the cradle
as a separate small print (`p64_cradle_insert.stl`) glued in on the real adapters at the
first assembly. Every output folder has the same file names (`p64_enclosure_print.stl`/
`.3mf`, `p64_enclosure_service.stl` with 0.45 mm clearance for bureaus, the insert,
`render_*.png`). The exact `openscad` commands are in `enclosure/README.md`, together with
the design rationale, the budget, the verified dimensions and the list of things that
could not be verified. Versions v1 to v6 (v1 is the only printed one, the fit evidence)
live in `enclosure/archive/pre-v7/` with their own README; do not bring their features
back without asking. Rules that have held across versions: every wall or rib 2 mm or
thicker (the insert's glued 1.2 mm sole and bottom wall are the named exceptions; 1.2 is also JLC3DP's thin-wall line); check any
new geometry against the Waveshare drawings in `enclosure/input/` and record hand
measurements in `input/measurements.md`.

## Working conventions

- One commit per logical step, with a descriptive message.
- The principal, main prompts in each session (which might be more than one) must be
  written down, verbatim, into the prompt/ folder for backup/auditing purposes. (Rule
  set by the user on 2026-09-22.) Mechanics: one file per main prompt, named
  `prompt/pNNN-short-slug.txt` with the next free number; the text exactly as the user
  wrote it, nothing added; committed on its own as `prompt: pNNN (what it asked)`. A
  main prompt is one that starts or redirects the session's work; follow-up remarks,
  answers to questions and small corrections are not written down. **Prompts about
  private work (anything in `firmware/private/`, the p64-private repository) are never
  recorded, anywhere** (user rule, 2026-09-24); only public work goes into `prompt/`.
- Tests travel with the code (rule set by the user on 2026-09-22, from the review in
  `docs/review-2026-09/`): before a commit that touches `firmware/`, run
  `python tests\host\run.py` from `firmware/`; a fix for a bug found on the device ships
  in the same commit with the test that would have caught it (a host test when the code
  is pure, a device test otherwise); a new component or file is host-testable unless it
  talks to hardware, and the "host-testable" column of the architecture table stays
  true. The resource floors live in `firmware/budgets.json` (checked by `api_smoke.py`,
  `soak.py` and `tools\check_size.py`); a change that breaks a floor raises it there
  deliberately, in the same commit, with the reason in the message.
- Each area's README is the living record: when the hardware teaches something (pin map,
  orientation, driver quirk, measured numbers), write it there, not only in code comments.
- Numbers that come from Waveshare drawings or from measurement are stated with their
  source; guesses are labelled as such.
