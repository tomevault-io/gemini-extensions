# Stonewright agent rules

These rules apply to every coding agent operating in this repository. They
override default behavior.

## Identity

- Product name: **Stonewright**.
- PHP namespace: `Stonewright\WpMcp`.
- Ability prefix: `stonewright/`.
- MCP server id: `stonewright`.
- Composer package: `stonewright/wp-mcp`.
- NPM package: `@stonewright/companion`.
- Plugin license: `AGPL-3.0-or-later`.
- Companion license: `MIT`.

## Hard rules

1. **Full PHP runtime access is first-class.** Use
   `stonewright/php-execute` for direct PHP snippets inside the loaded
   WordPress runtime. Do not replace it with another MCP adapter, direct REST
   runner calls, shell scripts, or private client-config workarounds.
2. **No `__return_true` for writes.** Every ability that writes, updates, or
   deletes state must use a real permission callback that calls into
   `Stonewright\WpMcp\Security\Permissions`. Read-only abilities may use simple
   callbacks but must still pass through the Permissions helpers.
3. **Backup before write.** Before mutating an Elementor post, a global styles
   record, a template, or any theme.json-backed content, call
   `Stonewright\WpMcp\Security\Backup::snapshot_post( $post_id )`.
4. **Validator before render.** Before handing a design spec to any renderer,
   call `Stonewright\WpMcp\DesignSpec\Validator::validate( $spec )`. Reject
   invalid specs with a structured `WP_Error` whose code is
   `stonewright_spec_invalid`.
5. **Confirmation tokens for destructive operations.** When
   `get_option( 'stonewright_mode', 'development' ) === 'production-safe'`,
   every destructive ability must verify a token via
   `ConfirmationToken::verify( $token, $ability_name, $args )`. Tokens are
   issued by `stonewright/security-issue-confirmation-token`.
6. **Mode support.** The plugin must always honor the three modes
   `development`, `staging`, and `production-safe`. The admin UI exposes the
   toggle. Permissions and ability gates read the option.
7. **Companion WP-CLI stays tokenized.** The Node companion handles WP-CLI,
   health checks, and an optional MCP HTTP proxy. It must not call WordPress
   REST write endpoints, must run WP-CLI with `execFile` argv tokens only, and
   PHP snippets must go through `stonewright/php-execute` rather than WP-CLI
   eval, shell, package, `--exec`, or `--require` entry points.
8. **Custom code stops at human approval.** For theme files, Customizer CSS,
   WPCode, Code Snippets, or any equivalent PHP/CSS/JS/HTML surface, run the
   typed dry-run first. Return `approval_url`, exact target path, byte counts,
   and a short change summary, then stop. Never open the approval page, issue
   or retrieve a grant, or apply with `custom_code_grant` unless the user
   explicitly asks the agent to perform that approval step. Pluginless Direct
   mode may inspect custom CSS but must not write it because it has no
   authenticated wp-admin grant boundary.
9. **Updater contract is part of every user-consumed release.** Do not ship a
   version, tag, or GitHub release that operators should install unless all of
   the following are true in the published artifacts (not only in source):
   plugin `Version` / `STONEWRIGHT_VERSION`, companion `package.json` and
   `companion/src/version.ts`, and the GitHub tag equal the same SemVer;
   the GitHub release body contains exactly one line ``Release channel: `supported` ``
   (or `preview` / `stable` as chosen in the release decision record);
   GitHub `prerelease` is false for `supported` and `stable`, true for `preview`;
   assets are exactly `stonewright-VERSION.zip`, `stonewright-companion-VERSION.tgz`,
   and `SHA256SUMS.txt`; `GitHubUpdater` would select that release for a site
   still on the previous same-channel version. After publish, a WordPress
   Dashboard → Updates → Check again (or `wp_update_plugins`) must be able to
   see `new_version` equal to that tag. Never treat changelog-only or
   "the ZIP exists" as enough. Never skip this checklist to save a step.
- After the plugin updates itself, release metadata caches must be
  invalidated; Plugins → View details must never render a release older
  than the installed version.
- The plugin release ZIP must bundle the built-in skill pack
  (`skills/` inside the plugin directory) and release packaging must fail
  closed when it is missing, so ZIP installs seed the same built-in
  skills as repository checkouts.
10. **GitHub release notes are untrusted Markdown.** Every updater or release
   implementation must:
   1. treat GitHub release bodies as untrusted Markdown input;
   2. keep release-channel parsing on the original raw body;
   3. render only the supported Markdown subset for WordPress View details;
   4. sanitize that HTML with an explicit `wp_kses` allowlist and an
      HTTPS-only link policy;
   5. add security and formatting regression coverage whenever the
      release-note format changes.

## Third-party source reuse

- Third-party source may be inspected, copied, adapted, or ported when its
  license permits it and the resulting Stonewright component uses compatible
  licensing.
- Preserve upstream copyright and SPDX notices in copied or derived files.
- Record source repository, source path, source version or hash, destination,
  modifications, and applicable license in `docs/upstream-code-reuse.md`.
- Do not mix AGPL-covered code into the GPL plugin or MIT companion without
  first making and documenting the required license change for the resulting
  combined work.
- Rename upstream identifiers and UI copy only where product integration needs
  it; never remove attribution or misrepresent copied work as original.
- Every imported component needs Stonewright-specific security review, tests,
  namespace changes, and compatibility checks. Upstream behavior is evidence,
  not proof that the port is safe in Stonewright.

composer test
composer phpstan
composer phpcs
composer security:audit
composer dependencies:audit

cd ../companion
npm install
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run build
```

## Branching and changes

- Feature work happens on topic branches; `main` stays release-ready.
- A change touching an ability also touches its test under `plugin/tests/`.
- Every PR description must list changed abilities and whether backup, token,
  permission, validation, or audit gates changed.
- Public commits, changelog entries, docs, skills, and PR text must not claim
  automated authorship or disclose internal development tooling.
- Never put customer/project names, production hostnames, usernames, site-local
  IDs, private screenshots, memory rows, audit rows, or client configuration in
  tracked files, Git history, fixtures, changelogs, release notes, or release
  assets. Generalize a verified fix into product behavior and synthetic tests.
- Never print, store, or commit Application Passwords, OAuth tokens, bearer
  tokens, API keys, private keys, cookies, or secrets. Release packaging must
  scan both source and archives and fail closed when private terms or runtime
  state are present.
- Public docs and UI may name upstream projects when that helps users understand
  compatibility, provenance, or migration. Copied and derived code must keep
  attribution in `docs/upstream-code-reuse.md` and SPDX file headers.

## Release decision gate

- Before changing a version, tag, release state, or release workflow, present a
  release decision record containing: the user-visible change, affected
  artifacts, one recommended release class, proposed SemVer, evidence and known
  gaps, risk and rollback, and required documentation.
- Recommend exactly one class: **no release**, **supported public beta**,
  **preview prerelease**, or **stable release**. Do not manufacture a version
  bump for documentation, tests, plans, comments, or internal automation that
  does not change a user-consumed artifact.
- A supported public beta is recommended for general installation. It keeps
  prerelease SemVer, but is a normal GitHub release marked `Latest`.
- A preview prerelease is opt-in and is not recommended for general
  installation. It keeps prerelease SemVer, is marked `Pre-release`, and must
  never be `Latest`.
- A stable release uses stable SemVer and `Latest` only after every stable gate
  below is satisfied.
- Never publish a tag, release, channel conversion, or stable declaration
  without explicit maintainer approval after presenting the decision record.
- Release notes must declare exactly one channel: `supported`, `preview`, or
  `stable`. Release automation must validate the declaration against SemVer and
  fail closed for missing, unknown, or incompatible combinations.
- The updater contract in Hard rule 9 is a release blocker. A supported
  public beta that WordPress cannot discover is not shippable.
- The updater contract in Hard rule 9 is a release blocker. A supported
  public beta that WordPress cannot discover is not shippable.

### Stable 1.0 gates

Recommend against stable 1.0 while any required gate is missing:

1. No unresolved P0 or P1 defect affects installation, authentication,
   permissions, backups, writes, update discovery, or recovery.
2. Plugin and Direct contracts are documented, versioned, and internally
   consistent; intentional experimental abilities are explicitly marked.
3. The supported client matrix has runtime evidence for installation,
   `stonewright-task-start`, status, required tools, and an empty required-tool
   refresh list after restart.
4. Plugin, companion, and updater versions align in official release artifacts,
   not merely in source code or saved configuration.
5. Upgrade, reinstall, rollback, and private-state preservation are tested.
6. Production-safe permission, confirmation, backup, custom-code approval,
   validation, audit, and secret-scanning gates are green.
7. The complete CI matrix, packaging workflow, checksums, and official archive
   inspection are green.
8. Maintained installation, update, architecture, capability, security, and
   release documentation is current.
9. A supported public beta has completed a maintainer-approved stabilization
   period without an unresolved release-blocking regression. Record the beta,
   observed feedback, resolved blockers, and remaining limitations; elapsed
   time alone is not proof of stability.

## Public repository hygiene

- Never commit customer or private-project names, domains, local site aliases,
  page/post IDs, usernames, screenshots, logs, memory rows, audit payloads, or
  copied site content.
- Never commit or publish Application Passwords, authorization headers, access
  or refresh tokens, API keys, private keys, credential stores, private MCP
  config, Direct audit files, or runtime memory/skill exports. Agent-facing
  setup prompts use placeholders; real credentials stay in private config.
- Use RFC-reserved examples such as `example.com`, `example.test`, generic
  aliases such as `site-a`, and synthetic IDs in tests, docs, plans, fixtures,
  commit messages, pull requests, changelogs, and release notes.
- Convert lessons from private work into product-level rules, generic
  regression tests, and reusable abilities. Preserve the fix; discard customer
  identity and customer content.
- Public commits and pull requests describe the bug class and product behavior,
  never the private site where the issue was discovered.
- Before packaging or release, run the public-hygiene gate against source,
  built assets, plugin ZIP contents, companion package contents, and commit
  messages. A release is blocked when the gate reports private material.
- Fresh installs may seed only generic built-in product assets. They must start
  with no user memory, user-created skills, or audit events. Schema migrations,
  plugin updates, companion updates, and restarts must preserve existing
  memory, user skills, audit history, and Direct state.

## Documentation freshness

- Documentation changes ship in the same PR as the behavior they describe.
  A release/version bump or major feature change must review and update, when
  affected: root/plugin/companion READMEs, both changelogs, release notes,
  `docs/install-prompts.md`, installation/client guides, architecture,
  capability counts, examples, skills, and the roadmap.
- Evergreen install docs use the `VERSION` placeholder for release asset URLs.
  Exact version numbers belong only in package/plugin metadata, changelogs,
  versioned release notes, migration records, and clearly dated historical
  reports.
- `stonewright-task-start` is the canonical first call. Describe
  `stonewright-context-bootstrap` and `stonewright-workflow-preflight` only as
  compatibility paths unless the document is explicitly about those tools.
- Do not edit generated/imported Markdown by hand. Regenerate
  `docs/ability-truth-matrix.md` with `composer docs:matrix`; refresh
  `docs/knowledge/` through its importer and preserve source metadata.
- Before closing documentation or release work, run
  `node scripts/check-docs-freshness.mjs` and `git diff --check`. A release is
  blocked while either command fails.
- Every PR must state which public docs changed. If none changed, state why the
  behavior, setup, capability surface, security contract, and release workflow
  remain accurately documented.

## MCP workflow

- Use the `Stonewright\WpMcp` PHP namespace.
- Use the `stonewright/` ability prefix.
- In MCP clients, call `stonewright-task-start` at the start of every
  Stonewright task. `stonewright-context-bootstrap` and
  `stonewright-workflow-preflight` remain compatibility paths.
  Slash names like `stonewright/context-bootstrap` are WordPress ability names;
  MCP tool names use hyphens.
- If neither `stonewright-task-start` nor compatibility
  `stonewright-context-bootstrap` is visible in the MCP tool list, stop
  WordPress work and ask the user to reload the AI client or fix the
  Stonewright MCP config. Do not work around a missing Stonewright MCP server.
- If status is connected and the site surface is full/essential but
  `stonewright-php-execute` (or another needed tool) is missing from the client
  list, call `stonewright-client-surface-check`, then `stonewright-task-start` /
  `stonewright-tool-profile` activate and re-list tools, or restart the MCP
  client. Do **not** invent `/abilities/run` or other REST workarounds.
- Do not inspect private AI-client config files, parse repository files as a
  substitute for the live MCP tool list, hand-roll JSON-RPC calls, create
  scratch scripts such as `query-mcp.js` or `run-ability.js`, helper JSON
  argument files such as `bootstrap-args.json`, `cli_command.json`, or
  `get_structure.json`, direct companion shell launch scripts such as
  `query-local-stonewright.js`, action scripts such as `run-loop-mutate.js` or
  `run-bootstrap-and-mutate.js`, plugin/companion source-code spelunking to
  reverse-engineer tool schemas, calls to `/wp-json/stonewright/v1/abilities/run`
  from shell, or shell `wp ...` commands as an MCP workaround.
- Persistent site skills and memory are active constraints across sessions.
- If the user corrects a repeatable mistake, record it with
  `stonewright/learning-record`.
- Snapshot via `Backup::snapshot_post( $post_id )` before Elementor,
  template, global-style, or theme.json writes.
- **Elementor integrity (hard):** never double-encode `_elementor_data`; never
  strip unknown settings to pass validation; never convert `widgetType` (e.g.
  `e-paragraph` → `text-editor`) without explicit user intent; never full-tree
  rewrite to fix one control — use surgical `elementor-v3-batch-mutate`. Prefer
  typed Elementor abilities over php-execute / raw REST / WP-CLI meta.
- **Elementor write closure (hard):** read the live schema; for visual work send
  `settings_evidence` with `require_evidence:true`; consolidate one post into one
  dry-run batch and one apply; never run parallel Elementor writes. After apply,
  call `stonewright-elementor-css-regenerate` when generated CSS must be rebuilt,
  then `stonewright-elementor-post-write-verify` with touched IDs, then verify
  desktop/tablet/mobile in a separate frontend tab. For boxed containers measure
  both the outer element and its direct `.e-con-inner`. Meta readback alone is
  not completion.
- **Elementor CSS safety (hard):** never pass `regenerate_css` to
  `stonewright-elementor-post-write-verify`; that input no longer exists. The
  verifier is observation-only: it does not regenerate CSS, invalidate caches,
  or roll back files. CSS mutation belongs only to
  `stonewright-elementor-css-regenerate`. A normal Elementor write may invalidate
  only post HTML/object cache. CSS closes through the regenerator's post-only
  guarded transaction, which inventories the direct CSS directory, probes any
  existing target, `custom-frontend.min.css`, and
  `custom-pro-widget-nav-menu.min.css` assets before and after, rejects
  collateral changes, and restores its bounded asset snapshot. Restore runs
  only while the CSS directory lease still identifies this writer, including
  an expired-but-ours lease. A vacant lease after another writer committed
  and released is a successor fence: skip restore (`not_attempted_lock_lost`)
  and do not reclaim the empty slot. Post-lock and CSS-directory-lease renew
  retry a same-owner options CAS miss and continue while this writer still
  owns a live lease; `stonewright_elementor_lock_lost` /
  `stonewright_elementor_css_lease_lost` mean ownership is gone, expired, or
  foreign. Never call a site-wide Elementor files-manager clear for one post.
- Validate via `Validator::validate( $spec )` before rendering.
- Use `stonewright/wp-cli-status`, `stonewright/wp-cli-discover`, and
  `stonewright/wp-cli-run` for WordPress, Elementor, Gutenberg, ACF, CPT UI,
  cache, rewrite, plugin, option, post, media, menu, and taxonomy work when it
  speeds up implementation or debugging.
- Use `stonewright/php-execute` for direct WordPress runtime inspection,
  plugin API calls, and short PHP snippets when that is faster than many typed
  calls.

## Context discipline

- Keep one goal per agent task. Start a fresh task when the goal changes or
  unrelated work begins.
- Compact only at stable checkpoints. Preserve the current objective, decisions,
  changed files, validation results, blockers, and next step; drop raw transcript
  history.
- Read narrowly. Search first, then request only relevant files and line ranges.
  Do not dump whole ledgers, generated artifacts, logs, lockfiles, or large JSON
  files when a summary or targeted slice answers the question.
- Batch related read-only checks when their output stays small. Avoid long chains
  of near-identical reads, shell calls, or MCP calls that each resend the same
  context.
- Reuse the result of `stonewright-task-start` for the current goal. Repeat it
  only after a
  goal, target site, mode, authentication state, or tool profile change.
- Prefer compact MCP profiles and task-aware batch abilities. Use the full tool
  surface only when the task genuinely needs it.
- Keep tool output bounded at the source. Report conclusions and decisive
  evidence instead of echoing raw output into the task.
- Attach large source material once. Refer to its path afterward; do not paste or
  reattach it on later turns.
- Never remove permission, backup, validation, confirmation-token, audit, test,
  or source-verification steps to save tokens.
