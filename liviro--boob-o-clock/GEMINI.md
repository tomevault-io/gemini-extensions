This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project

**Boob O'Clock** — a nighttime baby sleep/feed tracker for breastfeeding parents. Dark-mode-only PWA optimized for one-handed use on an iPhone SE at 3am.

## Architecture

Single Go binary serving a REST API and embedded frontend static files.

- `internal/domain/` — Pure state machine and types. **Zero external dependencies.** This is the source of truth for all state transitions. State is always derived from the event log, never stored separately.
- `internal/store/` — SQLite persistence via `modernc.org/sqlite` (pure Go, no CGo). Stores events and nights.
- `internal/reports/` — Report computation over event data. Pure Go.
- `internal/api/` — HTTP handlers. Orchestration: loads session from store, validates via domain, persists, enriches response with report data (e.g. breast suggestion), returns JSON.
- `internal/web/` — Embedded frontend assets via `go:embed`. Static files live in `internal/web/static/`.
- `cmd/server/` — Entry point. Wires dependencies, serves API + embedded frontend on configurable port.

## Core Domain: State Machine

18 states, 56 transitions. The transition table lives in `internal/domain/machine.go`. Key properties:
- AWAKE is the hub state — every state can reach it, and it's the only state that can end the night
- TRANSFERRING is instantaneous (deferred outcome — user picks result when hands are free)
- SELF_SOOTHING is reachable from SLEEPING_CRIB (baby stirred) and AWAKE (put down awake)
- POOP is reachable from 7 states (everything except FEEDING, TRANSFERRING, NIGHT_OFF)
- FEEDING supports a self-transition (switch breast) that logs dislatch + restart
- LEARNING / CHECK_IN are Ferber-mode states. LEARNING supports a self-transition (`mood_change`) analogous to FEEDING's switch-breast. They're classified as non-sleep in timeline stats.
- CHAIR is a Chair-mode state, reachable only from AWAKE; baby is awake during chair (parent sitting in the room). Outcomes: SLEEPING_CRIB via the generic `Settled` action, or back to AWAKE via `exit_chair`. Feed/poop/transfer route through AWAKE — not reachable directly from CHAIR. Classified as non-sleep in timeline stats.
- Ferber entry actions (`put_down_awake_ferber`, `baby_stirred_ferber`) and Chair entry action (`sit_chair`) are action-level variants of their non-mode counterparts — the backend picks which variant is valid per night based on `ferber_enabled` / `chair_enabled`, so the client renders `validActions` without branching. `sit_chair` replaces `put_down_awake` on chair nights (parallel to how `put_down_awake_ferber` replaces it on Ferber nights).

## Commands

```bash
# Build everything (frontend + Go binary)
make build

# Run all Go tests
make test

# Dev mode: Go on :8080, Vite on :5173 (with API proxy)
make dev

# Or individually:
go test ./...                              # Go tests
go test ./internal/domain/ -v              # domain tests verbose
cd web && npx tsc --noEmit                 # TypeScript type check
cd web && npm run build                    # build frontend only
go build -o boob-o-clock ./cmd/server      # build Go binary only
./boob-o-clock -addr :8080 -db ./data.db   # run server

# Docker
docker build -t boob-o-clock .
docker run -p 8080:8080 -v boc-data:/data boob-o-clock
```

## Frontend

Preact + TypeScript + Vite. Source in `web/src/`, builds to `internal/web/static/`.
- `web/src/api.ts` — typed API client
- `web/src/constants.ts` — state/action definitions, formatters. `ActionDef` supports `needsBreast` / `needsMood` / `confirm` flags that drive modal dispatch in Tracker.
- `web/src/ferber.ts` — Ferber interval table, mood types, `MOOD_LABELS` (emoji + word for `quiet` / `fussy` / `crying`)
- `web/src/hooks/useSession.ts` — session state management hook
- `web/src/hooks/useNow.ts` — shared-singleton 1 Hz ticker. One `setInterval` drives all consumers via a listener set; prevents per-component drift.
- `web/src/components/` — reusable UI components (Tracker screens, pickers, chart primitives like `NightModeHighlight`)
- `web/src/pages/` — Tracker and History pages
- ESLint is configured (`web/eslint.config.js`) with `react-hooks/rules-of-hooks` and `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` as errors. Run `cd web && npm run lint`.

## Conventions

- **TDD**: Write tests first, always. Red-green-refactor.
- **Domain purity**: `internal/domain/` must have zero dependencies outside the standard library.
- **Event sourcing**: Current state is derived from the event log via `DeriveState()`. No separate "current_state" column.
- **Timestamps**: All stored as RFC3339 with timezone offset. Frontend sends local time with offset.
- **Dark mode only**: No light theme. Background #000, designed for nighttime use.
- **Tap targets**: Minimum 48px, prefer 64px for primary actions. Design for iPhone SE (375px wide).
- **Metadata**: Stored as `map[string]string` serialized to JSON. Strictly event-level (no night-level config). Validation lives in `internal/domain/machine.go` — `actionsRequiringBreast` / `actionsRequiringMood` maps plus `validateBreast` / `validateMood` gate transitions. Common payloads: feed events `{"breast": "L"|"R"}`; Ferber entries and mood changes `{"mood": "quiet"|"fussy"|"crying"}`. `start_night` events have no metadata — Ferber night config is posted through a dedicated typed endpoint (see below).
- **Sleep-training modes are per-night, opt-in, mutually exclusive**: Mode config (`ferber_enabled`+`ferber_night_number`, `chair_enabled`) is set via `POST /api/session/start` with a typed body — `{ ferber?: { nightNumber } }` for Ferber, `{ chair: true }` for Chair — and persisted on the `sessions` row. The two modes are mutually exclusive on a given night (handler-validated; both flags can be enabled in server config simultaneously for historical-stats purposes). All non-session-creation actions go through `POST /api/session/event`. The backend picks the action set (`SelectActionsForNight` in `reports/`) so the frontend renders `validActions` without branching on mode state. Ferber's response carries a nested `ferber?: { nightNumber, current?: { checkInCount, startedAt, checkInAvailableAt?, mood } }` — outer presence encodes "current night is Ferber", inner `current` presence encodes "baby is in a Learning/CheckIn session right now". The Ferber graduated-interval table lives server-side in `internal/reports/ferber.go::IntervalFor` — the frontend is a pure subtracter of two timestamps. Chair carries no nested data (deliberately coarser): a flat `chairEnabled?: boolean` on the response. Each mode also has a flat suggestion field (`suggestFerberNight?: number`, `suggestChair?: boolean`) populated when start_night is a valid action and the relevant feature flag is on.
- **Feature flags for sleep-training modes**: runtime-toggleable via env var on the Go binary (e.g. `FERBER_ENABLED=true`, `CHAIR_ENABLED=true`), plumbed through `api.Config` in `cmd/server/main.go`. Surfaced to the frontend via `GET /api/config` → `{features:{...}}`, fetched once on boot through `ConfigProvider` in `web/src/hooks/useConfig.tsx`. The server enforces flag-off by rejecting opt-in requests (e.g. `POST /api/session/start` with `ferber:{}` or `chair:true`) and by suppressing mode-specific response fields like `suggestFerberNight` / `suggestChair`; the client gates all mode-specific UI (Start-Night toggle, chart highlights, badges, detail blocks) via `useConfig().features.<mode>`. In-progress sessions from before a flag flip continue to render normally — the flag controls new opt-ins, not stored history. **Adding a new mode** would mean introducing a `NightMode` discriminator across all layers (currently each mode is a separate bool — fine for two modes, would get unwieldy at three).
- **Schema migrations**: use `addColumnIfMissing` in `internal/store/sqlite.go` — probes `PRAGMA table_info` and adds columns only when absent. Idempotent across restarts.
- **Versioning**: Version is defined in `web/package.json`. When bumping: update `package.json`, run `npm install --package-lock-only` in `web/` to sync `package-lock.json`, commit and push both, then create a GitHub release with `gh release create`.
