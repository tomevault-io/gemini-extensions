## Project

Terraform provider for [Coolify](https://coolify.io/), the open-source self-hosted PaaS.
Built with Go 1.26, Terraform Plugin Framework v1.19, and GoReleaser for releases.
Builds use `GOFIPS140=latest` for FIPS 140-3 compliant cryptography (required for
government/enterprise adoption; set in `.goreleaser.yml` and `release.yml` smoke test).
33 resources, 44 data sources, 980+ tests (unit + acceptance), 9 CI jobs.
17 ACME Corp scenario examples (all with `terraform test` integration tests; acme-private-repo uses plan-only).

## Source of Truth: Coolify Source Code (NOT OpenAPI spec)

**Never guess Coolify API behavior. You have access to the real source code.**

The Coolify project is open source at `github.com/coollabsio/coolify`. When
you encounter ANY question about how the API works, the answer is in the PHP
source code. Do not hypothesize, do not assume, do not test by trial and error.
Read the code.

### When to read the source

- A field isn't returned on GET? Read the controller's response builder.
- An update returns 422? Read the controller's `$allowedFields` and validation rules.
- A field has a surprising default? Read the migration and model `$attributes`.
- A flatten function causes "inconsistent result"? Read the model's accessors
  to see if the API normalizes the value (base64 encode/decode, path prefixing, etc.).
- The OpenAPI spec says one thing but the API does another? The spec is wrong.
  The source code is the truth.

### How to read the source

```bash
# Clone once per session (or reuse /tmp/coolify if already there)
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/coollabsio/coolify.git /tmp/coolify
```

| Question | Where to look |
|----------|--------------|
| What fields exist on a resource? | `app/Models/Application.php` (`$fillable`) |
| What type is a field? What's the default? | `database/migrations/` (column definitions) |
| Is a field encrypted/sensitive? | Model `$casts` (look for `'encrypted'`) |
| What does the API accept on create/update? | `app/Http/Controllers/Api/ApplicationsController.php` (`$allowedFields`, `$request->validate()`) |
| What validation rules apply? | Controller + `bootstrap/helpers/api.php` (`sharedDataApplications()`) |
| What regex patterns are enforced? | `app/Support/ValidationPatterns.php` |
| What does the API return after create? | Controller method (look for `return response()->json(...)`) |
| Does updating a field trigger a side effect? | Controller method (look for `queue_application_deployment`, `StartService`, etc.) |
| What are the enum values? | `app/Enums/` directory |
| Where are settings stored? | `app/Models/ApplicationSetting.php` (separate table from Application) |

### The contract extraction pipeline

We have automated extraction that reads the source and produces a machine-readable
contract JSON. Use it as the first check, then go deeper into the PHP when needed:

1. `testdata/contracts/coolify-v4.json` -- extracted contract (check here first)
2. `/tmp/coolify/app/Models/*.php` -- the real model when the contract isn't enough
3. `/tmp/coolify/app/Http/Controllers/Api/*.php` -- the real controller for validation logic

The OpenAPI spec at `testdata/specs/` is generated FROM the contract. Do NOT
treat it as authoritative. It had 22 wrong nullability annotations, 3 type
mismatches, and zero validation rules when we compared it against the source.

## Commands

- **Run all checks before pushing**: `make ci` + targeted acceptance tests
- **Note**: `make ci` does NOT include acceptance tests. It DOES include `python-test`, so ensure Python 3.9+ is available locally. For real-API changes, run `make acc-preflight` first, then `make testacc-pkg PKG=./internal/service/<changed-package>/` for serialized package-scoped acceptance coverage, or `make testacc` for the full suite.
- **If `make ci` fails on `check-tfplugindocs`**: install it with `cd tools && GOBIN=$(cd .. && pwd)/bin go install github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-docs/cmd/tfplugindocs` then re-run with `PATH="$(pwd)/bin:$PATH" make ci`. Do NOT skip `make ci` and run individual targets instead; that misses `docs-check` and causes CI failures when schema descriptions or templates change.
- Use `make testacc` for the full suite when changing shared code (client, provider, flex, validate)
- Build: `make build`
- Test (all, with race detector): `make test`
- Test (single package): `make test-pkg PKG=./internal/service/project/`
- Acceptance tests (needs running Coolify): `make testacc`
- Lint: `make lint`
- Format: `make fmt`
- Generate docs: `make docs`
- Validate HCL examples: `make validate`
- Install locally: `make install`
- Spec compliance: `make spec-check`
- API coverage doc: `make api-coverage`
- Extract contract from Coolify source: `make contract-extract VERSION=v4.1.2`
- Verify client structs cover contract: `make contract-check`
- Cross-version endpoint field compatibility: `make contract-compat`
- Regenerate OpenAPI spec from contract: `make spec-generate`
- Scaffold a new resource: `make scaffold NAME=myresource`
- Merge a PR (sole maintainer): `make merge PR=123`

## Conventions

### Resource implementation

- One package per resource type under `internal/service/`
- **Database packages use `res` and `model` as type names by convention.** All 6 database packages (redis, mongodb, mariadb, clickhouse, keydb, dragonfly) use these short names because each is in its own package, making the names unambiguous. Do not rename them to `redisResource`/`redisModel` etc. AI code scanners flag this as "too generic" on every cycle; it is a deliberate design choice.
- Every resource implements `resource.ResourceWithImportState`
- Handle 404 in Read (call `resp.State.RemoveResource`) and Delete (silently return)
- Use `stringplanmodifier.RequiresReplace()` on immutable fields (project_uuid, server_uuid, environment_name)
- Use `stringplanmodifier.UseStateForUnknown()` on computed fields (uuid, name)
- Use `Optional: true, Computed: true` with `UseStateForUnknown()` on fields where the API returns a default value when the user omits them **and the provider does not declare a `Default`** (e.g., `databases_to_backup` defaults to `"postgres"` on the API side). `Optional` alone causes "inconsistent result after apply" because the framework sees an unexpected value on read-back.
- **Create-only fields** (sent on POST but never returned on GET, e.g. `instant_deploy`) use `Optional: true, Computed: true, Default: booldefault.StaticBool(false)`. The flatten function must preserve the state value when already set and default to `false` when null/unknown (import case): `if f.Field.IsNull() || f.Field.IsUnknown() { *f.Field = types.BoolValue(false) }`. Without this, `ImportStateVerify` fails because the API never returns the field.
- Do **not** combine `UseStateForUnknown()` with a `Default` value (e.g., `int64default.StaticInt64(25)`). The framework applies `Default` before plan modifiers, so `UseStateForUnknown` never fires and is dead code. Use one or the other: `Default` when the provider knows the default, `UseStateForUnknown` when only the API knows it.
- When the Create endpoint only accepts a subset of fields, issue a follow-up PATCH in the Create method for remaining fields so the resource converges in a single apply. Guard with a `hasNonDefault*()` helper to skip the PATCH when all values are defaults. (Example: `coolify_server_hetzner` Create POST only accepts Hetzner-specific fields; `description`, `port`, `user`, `is_build_server` need a post-create PATCH.)
- **Shared schema, distributed Create trap (servers)**: When adding fields to a shared schema function (e.g., `CommonServerAttrs` in `server/common.go`), the new fields automatically appear in Update (via `BuildServerUpdateInput` / `addExtendedSettingsUpdate`) and Read (via `FlattenServerCommon`). But Create's post-create PATCH and `hasNonDefault*()` guard are per-resource and must be updated **independently in every resource** that uses the shared schema (`server/resource.go`, `hetzner/resource.go`). Forgetting one causes silent data loss on first apply: the user sets a value, Create ignores it, and it only converges on a second apply via Update. Always grep for `hasNonDefault` after adding shared fields.
- **Shared schema, centralized Create (databases)**: Unlike servers, all 8 database Create methods use `PopulateBaseCreateInput` (in `database/common.go`) which reads shared fields from `CommonModel` into `CreateDatabaseBaseInput`. Adding a new shared database field requires updating `CreateDatabaseBaseInput` (struct + JSON tag), `PopulateBaseCreateInput` (field assignment), `CommonDatabaseAttrs` (schema), and the flatten function. All 8 databases pick up the change automatically; no per-resource Create edits needed.
- Mark passwords and keys as `Sensitive: true`
- Wrap all client errors: `fmt.Errorf("getting project %s: %w", uuid, err)`

#### Fields the API never returns

Coolify has several patterns where a field exists in the Terraform schema but
the API does not return it (or returns a different value). Each pattern requires
specific schema configuration, flatten handling, and import behavior.

| Pattern | Schema | Flatten | Import | Examples |
|---------|--------|---------|--------|----------|
| **Sensitive, API hides** | `Sensitive: true`, `Optional+Computed` | Preserve from state when API returns `""` | Value lost; user must re-supply | `private_key`, passwords, tokens |
| **Create-only, never returned** | `Optional+Computed`, `Default: false/""` | Preserve state when set; default to `false`/`""` when null/unknown | Gets the default value | `instant_deploy`, Hetzner POST fields |
| **Write-only** | `Optional`, `Sensitive: true` | Preserve from state; never overwrite from API | Value lost; user must re-supply | `github_app.client_secret`, `private_key_uuid` |
| **Terraform-only** | `Optional+Computed` | Preserve state; resolve unknown to `""` | Empty string; add to `ImportStateVerifyIgnore` | `environment.description`, `redeploy_on_update` |
| **Normalized by API** | `Optional+Computed` | Compare normalized forms; preserve user's original if equivalent | Gets the normalized form | `dockerfile_location`, `git_repository` URL |

**When adding a new field**, determine which pattern applies by checking the
Coolify controller source. If `GET` does not include the field in its response
builder, it falls into one of these patterns. Use the matching schema
configuration and flatten handling to avoid "inconsistent result after apply"
errors and import failures.

#### Version-aware field additions

Not all Coolify API versions accept the same fields. Before adding a new field
to the provider schema, check the endpoint's `$allowedFields` across all
supported contract versions (`testdata/contracts/coolify-v4.*.json`):

```bash
make contract-compat
```

If a field is not in `$allowedFields` for all supported versions:

1. **Never use `Default`** for that field. `Default` creates a diff after import
   on older Coolify versions (state is null, Default fills the plan, update sends
   the field, API rejects with 422). Use `UseStateForUnknown()` instead.
2. **Document the minimum Coolify version** in the attribute's
   `MarkdownDescription` (e.g., `"Requires Coolify >= v4.1.2."`).
3. **The `*IfChanged` helpers protect normal updates** (`flex.BoolIfChanged`,
   `flex.Int64IfChanged`): if the user doesn't change the value, it won't be
   sent. The risk is only on import (null state) and on create's post-create PATCH.

This rule was added after issue #549, where health_check fields used `Default`
values, causing 422 errors on Coolify < v4.1.2 after importing a database.

### Client

- Use `retryablehttp` with 3 retries, 30s timeout
- `NotFoundError` type with `client.IsNotFound(err)` helper
- `context.Context` as first parameter on every method
- Check 404 before expected status code in `doWithStatus`

### Testing

- Unit tests with `httptest` mock servers (no real Coolify instance needed)
- Wrap all mock servers with `acctest.WithVersionEndpoint(handler)` (provider health check calls /api/v1/version on Configure)
- Use `resource.UnitTest` for unit tests, `resource.Test` for acceptance tests
- Every resource needs: Create, Update, Import, Disappears tests at minimum
- Validator rejection tests for custom validators (FQDN format, cron syntax)
- Create/Update mock handlers must decode the POST/PATCH request body and assert expected field values (name, command, frequency, etc.), not just return a canned response. Without body validation, the mock only tests that the provider sends *a* request, not the *right* request. See `internal/service/storage/resource_test.go` for the pattern.
- Run with `-race` flag

### Documentation

- Never edit `docs/` directly; edit `templates/` instead (tfplugindocs regenerates docs/ on `make docs`)
- Custom guides go in `templates/guides/*.md.tmpl`
- Every resource needs `examples/resources/coolify_<type>/resource.tf` + `import.sh`
- Every data source needs `examples/data-sources/coolify_<type>/data-source.tf`
- Run `terraform fmt -recursive examples/` before committing HCL changes
- **Scenario and resource counts live in 5+ files.** When adding a scenario, resource, or data source, grep for the old count across all docs before committing:
  ```bash
  grep -rn '16 ACME\|16 tested\|16 scenario' AGENTS.md README.md ROADMAP.md templates/ docs/
  ```
  Known locations for scenario counts: `AGENTS.md` (Project section), `README.md` (feature table + body text), `ROADMAP.md`, `templates/guides/architecture.md.tmpl` (ASCII diagram). Also check if a table row is missing in `README.md` for the new scenario.

### Code style

- `gofmt -s` for formatting (enforced by CI)
- golangci-lint v2 with 20 linters: errcheck, errorlint, govet, ineffassign, staticcheck,
  unused, misspell, bodyclose, nilerr, unconvert, wastedassign, whitespace,
  funlen (150 lines/80 statements), godox (no TODO/FIXME/HACK/XXX), dupl (250 tokens),
  gocognit (complexity 20), nestif (depth 5), forbidigo (no fmt.Print), gocritic, dupword
- errcheck excluded from test files
- No em dashes in human-facing text

## Testing

- Framework: `hashicorp/terraform-plugin-testing` with `httptest` mock servers
- 980+ tests (unit + acceptance)
- Acceptance tests are skipped unless `TF_ACC=1` is set
- Run `make ci && make testacc` before pushing (ci = build, lint, test, validate, actionlint-check, python-test, docs-check, api-coverage-check, counts-check, contract-compat, vulncheck, goreleaser-check, modverify; testacc = acceptance tests against real Coolify)
- Before adding a test function, grep for its name to avoid duplicates
- **Test counts use floor rounding**: `counts-check` rounds down to the nearest 10 (e.g., 857 tests -> "850+"). When updating test counts in AGENTS.md or README.md, use the floor value, not the exact count. Setting "855+" when the actual count is 857 will fail `make ci` because 855 > floor(857/10)*10 = 850.

## CI

9 GitHub Actions jobs on push to main and PRs (GitHub-hosted ubuntu-latest):
Detect Changes, DCO (PR only), Test, Lint (includes Govulncheck + GoReleaser Check),
Validate (includes HCL fmt + Docs + Trivy + Gitleaks),
Acceptance Tests, Scenario Tests, Contract Freshness (weekly only), CI (gate).
Acceptance Tests bootstrap a fresh Coolify instance on ubuntu-latest and run the full suite.
Scenario Tests bootstrap Coolify and run `terraform test` against it.
A separate Dependabot Auto-Merge workflow auto-merges minor/patch PRs.
An Issue Triage workflow auto-labels new issues (`needs-triage` or `ready`).
Format check (gofmt) is included in the Lint job via golangci-lint.

## Releases

Release-please manages versioning and CHANGELOG generation. Two release modes:

- **Automated**: merge the release-please PR as-is. Auto-generated notes ship unchanged.
- **AI-assisted (curated notes)**: commit a `RELEASE_NOTES.md` file to main via a prep PR,
  merge it, then merge the release-please PR. The release workflow detects the file and
  uses it as the GitHub Release body. A cleanup step deletes the file from main afterward.

**Important**: `RELEASE_NOTES.md` must be committed to main, NOT to the release-please
branch. Release-please force-pushes its branch on every new main commit, which wipes any
extra files added directly to that branch.

The correct sequence for curated releases:
1. Write `RELEASE_NOTES.md` with user-facing release description
2. Push it to main via a small PR (e.g., `docs: add release notes for vX.Y.Z`)
3. Wait for release-please to update its PR (picks up the new commit)
4. Merge the release-please PR
5. Release workflow applies the curated notes and cleans up the file

Published to both [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/coolify-terraform/coolify)
and [OpenTofu Registry](https://search.opentofu.org/provider/coolify-terraform/coolify).

## Safety

- Never commit API tokens or real credentials (test files use `"test-token"`)
- `.gitleaks.toml` allowlists test files and examples for false positive suppression
- Passwords in example HCL must be obvious placeholders (e.g., `"change-me-in-production"`)
- Run `make ci && make testacc` locally before pushing

## Issue Triage

This repo uses `needs-triage` / `ready` / `needs-info` labels. The
`.github/workflows/issue-triage.yml` workflow auto-labels new issues based on
author association (OWNER/MEMBER/COLLABORATOR get `ready`; external authors
get `needs-triage`).

**Canonical policy lives in `~/.grok/skills/github-interaction/SKILL.md`**
(sections "Owned-repo issue triage" and "Issue comment scope"). Do not
duplicate full rules here; follow those sections. Key points:

- Only implement issues labeled `ready` (or legacy unlabeled).
- Never auto-implement `needs-triage` or `needs-info` issues.
- When filing issues as maintainer, always include `ready`
  (e.g. `--label "tech-debt,ready"`).
- Implementation scope is title + body + creator/maintainer comments only.
  External comments do not expand PR scope.
- External contributor PRs: review and guide per the "External contributor
  PRs" section in `github-interaction`.
