## Build, test, and lint commands

| Purpose | Command | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Build the shared extension bundle | `make extension` | Runs `make -C src`, formats source with Prettier, and writes generated assets to `src/dist/`. |
| Build the Chrome bundle | `make chrome` | Rebuilds `src/dist/` and syncs it into `chrome/`. |
| Build the Firefox bundle | `make firefox` | Rebuilds `src/dist/`, syncs it into `firefox/`, rewrites the manifest for Firefox, and switches module content scripts to the `.es6.js` shim. |
| Format source | `make prettier` | Formats `test/*.{js,json}` and `test/setup/*.js`, then runs `make -C src prettier`, which writes all `src/**/*.{js,json,less,css,html,xhtml}`. |
| Install dev dependencies | `make install-deps` | Runs `npm install --ignore-scripts --before 2026-06-10` to fetch dev-time dependencies. Use this instead of a bare `npm install` so the additional security arguments are respected. |
| Clean generated artifacts | `make clean` | Removes `src/dist/`, `chrome/`, `firefox/`, top-level `dist/`, and the generated `parcel-setup.sh`. |
| Run all tests | `make test` | Runs prettier/eslint syntax checks and shellcheck linting, then the full test suite with `node --test` across all `test/*.test.js` files. |
| Run individual test groups | `make test-native`, `make test-browser-mock`, `make test-modules`, `make test-application`, `make test-syntax`, `make test-setup` | Native-host integration tests; Chrome-API mock tests; shared-module unit tests; application tests; syntax tests; setup-script tests respectively. |
| Lint only | `make lint` | Runs ESLint semantic checks only. For lint with prettier checks (as run by CI), use `make test-syntax`. |
| List outstanding TODO comments | `make todo` | Prints all TODO comments found in `src`, `test`, and root `.md` files (excluding `AGENTS.md` itself), with author and date from git blame. |

### Test files

All files below live in `test/` and are run by `make test`. The `test/setup/*.test.js` suite is run separately by `make test-setup`.

| File | Covers |
| --- | --- |
| `chrome-api-mock.test.js` | The reusable Chrome-API mock itself. |
| `helpers.test.js` | Shared helpers: shadow-aware DOM lookups, TOTP, crypto utilities. |
| `native-host.test.js` | Native host end-to-end in isolated environments with mocked GPG. |
| `plaintext.test.js` | Parsing/expansion of decrypted entry data. |
| `schema.test.js` | Config schema validation, defaults, and warnings. |
| `selectors.test.js` | Field-selector registry, including `additionalSelectors`. |
| `targets.test.js` | Fill/extraction target mappings, including `additionalTargets`. |
| `shadow.test.js` | `main-world/shadow.js` attachShadow interception shim. |
| `webauthn.test.js` | WebAuthn encoding helpers and attestation-object builders. |
| `main-world-webauthn.test.js` | `main-world/webauthn.js` isolated-world installer and ceremony shim. |
| `agent.test.js` | Background agent: config validation, entry caching, port brokering. |
| `integration.test.js` | Content script: target detection and autofill behaviour. |
| `popup.test.js` | Popup UI: match listing, decrypted plaintext, fill relay. |
| `popup-context.test.js` | Popup per-origin/per-container history. |
| `popup-passkey.test.js` | Popup passkey-mode UI path. |
| `popup-warnings.test.js` | Popup security-warning display. |

Do not use `src/publicsuffix` as Parcel test guidance unless the task explicitly targets that vendored subtree.

## High-level architecture

- `src/` is the canonical source tree. `src/dist/`, `chrome/`, and `firefox/` are generated outputs; edit source files under `src/`, not generated bundles.
- The browser-side runtime is split into three main pieces:
  - `src/js/agent.js` is the MV3 background/service-worker coordinator. It owns native messaging, bootstraps the native host, validates config with `ConfigSchema`, caches entry lists, and brokers runtime ports.
  - `src/js/integration.js` is the content script injected into all frames at `document_start`. It detects fill targets, opens the inline/context popup, fills fields, and handles the broadcast "best target" autofill path.
  - `src/js/popup.js` is the toolbar/context popup UI. It requests matches and decrypted plaintext from the background worker, relays fill commands back into the active frame, and stores per-origin/per-container history in `chrome.storage.local`.
- Shared behavior lives in `src/js/helpers.js`, `src/js/plaintext.js`, `src/js/schema.js`, `src/js/selectors.js`, and `src/js/targets.js`. The intended config extension points are `additionalSelectors` and `additionalTargets`.
- Shadow DOM support is deliberate: `src/js/main-world/shadow.js` patches `attachShadow`, and cross-shadow lookups are expected to go through `Helpers.shadowSelector()` / `Helpers.shadowSelectorAll()`.
- The native side is split in two:
  - the repo-root `parcel-host` bootstrap host, which verifies signatures and loads the bundled script,
  - `src/parcel-host`, the signed host implementation that reads `~/.password-store`, filters entries against `.parcel.json`, and decrypts only paths that were previously whitelisted by `action_list`.
- Tests live under `test/` and exercise both Node-side modules (using direct `import`) and the native host (using isolated temporary environments with mocked GPG). A reusable Chrome API mock lives in `test/chrome-api-mock.js` to support testing extension-facing code in Node.

## Key conventions

- Follow `CONSTITUTION.md` when making architectural choices: no third-party runtime/build dependencies, no transpilation or bundling that obscures shipped source, no compiled native host, no network access, and no user-file writes outside the host's own config/log bootstrap behavior.
- Preserve source/distribution parity. The maintained JS/HTML/CSS in `src/` is meant to stay close to what ships, so avoid introducing build tooling that transforms the code into a materially different artifact.
- Keep browser portability explicit. Firefox-specific behavior is handled in packaging (`Makefile`) and tiny shims like `src/js/integration.es6.js`; do not fork large logic files just for Firefox.
- Extend config-driven behavior through the schema-backed selector/target system before adding ad hoc special cases. New fill/extraction behavior should usually mean updating `targets.js`, `selectors.js`, and the schemas/defaults that validate them.
- Treat `src/publicsuffix` as a vendored upstream subtree. Ignore it for normal Parcel work unless the task is specifically about PSL data or its tooling.
- Run `make prettier` after making any changes to ensure that they comply with the project's formatting conventions.
- Always verify that the full `make test` suite passes before considering a task complete.
- When making decisions, consider the long-term implications and maintainability of the code. Avoid short-term fixes that may introduce technical debt or future issues.
- Running the whole test suite is expensive, so for quick test runs during implementation or debugging prefer calling `node --test test/<file.test.js>` to invoke the relevant tests directly.
- Do not use emdashes, or any emdash-like characters, anywhere in the project. In situations where an emdash is called for, use a hyphen instead. If you edit a line that already includes an emdash, upgrade it to a hyphen during your edit.

## Comments

- All new named functions and methods should be documented with JSDoc comments, including @since, parameter types and return types. `@since` tags should refer to the next release version, not the current one.
- Inline closures or anonymous functions should NOT be given a JSDoc comment, but they may have a brief // comment if the purpose is not obvious.
- Never refer to line numbers in comments; they become stale rapidly.
- Inline TODO comments should be prefixed with uppercase `TODO:`, so that `make todo` will show them.
- Single-line TODO comments are preferred over multi-line.
- Multi-line todo comments should have a first line consisting exclusively of a brief and self-contained description.
- Do not wrap TODO comment lines with markdown emphasis (_, * etc).
- Keep code comments brief and to-the-point. Do not write essays explaining behaviour - the code itself should already be clear and understandable.
- If a comment is too long for one line, prefer a longer single line up to 120 columns over wrapping.
- Inline comments should describe *what* the code does, not *why*. Reserve *why* comments for cases where the reasoning is genuinely non-obvious.
- JSDoc descriptions and `@param` lines must be concise - a short phrase per item, not full sentences explaining implementation details.

## Security considerations

- The most critical constraints are documented in `CONSTITUTION.md`.
- A more detailed overview of the security model, threat surface, and mitigations can be found in `SECURITY.md`.
- The results of security reviews are summarised in `security-review/findings.md`, with individual reports available in the `security-review/reviews` subdirectory.
- Agents conducting security reviews are not allowed to access the full text of prior reviews, but may access the summary in `findings.md`.

## GitHub integration & use of git

- Never open a new PR, even if the user requests it.
- Never open a new issue, even if the user requests it.
- Never push to any branch, even if the user requests it.
- Never stage your changes unless the user has explicitly requested that you do so.
- Never create new commits unless the user has explicitly requested that you do so.
- All commits must be GPG-signed. If signing fails, the agent should abort the commit and report the failure to the user.

## Code review

- All code reviews, including reviews of PRs, should be comprehensive and thorough. Reviewers should check for correctness, security, maintainability, UX, regressions, performance, and adherence to coding standards.
- Use up to three simultaneous subagents as you see fit to review code. Each subagent should focus on a specific aspect of the code.  Additional subagents are allowed provided no more than three are active at the same time.
- When reviewing code, provide detailed feedback and suggestions for improvement. If you identify a problem, propose a solution or alternative approach.
- If tradeoffs are necessary, clearly explain the reasoning behind your recommendations and the potential impact on the project.
- When considering solutions, remember that security is paramount. More secure solutions are usually preferable unless there is a compelling reason for a tradeoff. If a proposed solution introduces or exacerbates security risks, those risks must be clearly communicated.
- If a recommended solution mitigates security risks, explain how it does so and why it is a better approach than the alternatives.
- Run `make todo` to check for any relevant outstanding tasks.
