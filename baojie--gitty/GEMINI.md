# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

Gitty is an Electron desktop git history browser with four panes: working tree
(top left), diff (top right), commit log (bottom left) and an interactive shell
(bottom right). See README.md for the user-facing behaviour of each pane.

**Everything user-visible is English** — the interface, README, CHANGELOG and
commit messages. Conversation with the user may be in another language, but
nothing that lands in the repository is.

## Commands

```bash
./run.sh [repo]          # build if stale, launch detached, print the pid
./run.sh --fg [repo]     # same but attached to the terminal
./run.sh --dev [repo]    # electron-vite dev with hot reload
npm run typecheck        # tsc over both tsconfigs — the only automated check
npm run build            # electron-vite build into out/
./setup.sh               # symlink run.sh as `gitty` into ~/.local/bin
```

A detached run writes everything to
`${XDG_STATE_HOME:-~/.local/state}/gitty/gitty.log`; use `--fg` when you want
the output inline.

There is **no test suite and no linter configured**. `npm run typecheck` is the
whole automated safety net; run it after every change. Verification beyond that
is visual — see below.

`npm install` runs `electron-rebuild -f -w node-pty` via `postinstall`; node-pty
is native and must match Electron's ABI, not Node's. If the terminal pane fails
to start after changing Electron versions, re-run that rebuild.

## Verifying changes visually

The UI cannot be checked by reading code, and this is a Wayland session where
X11 screenshot tools capture nothing. Screenshot it from inside Electron
instead: build, patch a `capturePage` call into `out/main/index.js` (the built
bundle, never the source) at the `ready-to-show` handler, run with
`GITTY_REPO=<repo>` and an env var carrying a delay plus an output path, then
read the PNG. Drive the UI first by passing a snippet to
`win.webContents.executeJavaScript` — clicking `.commit-row`, `.row` or header
buttons, or dispatching a `contextmenu` MouseEvent. `out/` is gitignored and
rebuilt, so the patch is throwaway.

Use a repository with real history for this; this repo's own log is short.

## Architecture

Three processes with a hard boundary between them:

- **`src/main/`** — owns everything privileged: git subprocesses, the pty, the
  fs watcher, dialogs, clipboard, `shell.openPath`.
- **`src/preload/`** — the only bridge. Exposes a frozen `window.gitty` API over
  `contextBridge`; the renderer has no node integration and no direct IPC.
- **`src/renderer/`** — React UI, pure presentation over that API.
- **`src/shared/types.ts`** — the contract both sides import.

Adding a capability means touching all three: an `ipcMain.handle` in
`src/main/index.ts`, a method in `src/preload/index.ts`, and a type in
`src/shared/types.ts`.

### Git access

`src/main/git.ts` shells out to `git` via `execFile` — no git library. Parsing
relies on NUL-separated machine formats (`status --porcelain=v2 -z`,
`--name-status -z`, `ls-tree -z`) so paths with spaces and renames survive;
rename records carry an extra NUL field, which is why those loops advance the
index by hand. Diffs above 2 MB are truncated with a notice rather than sent
whole. Whatever `git` is on `PATH` is what the app shows.

### Multiple repositories, tabs

`App.tsx` is a thin tab manager: the list of open roots, which is active, the
app-wide preferences (theme, font size, wrap, …), and the settings dialog. Each
open root renders one `RepoTab` (`src/renderer/src/RepoTab.tsx`) owning that
repository's whole session — status, log, the `View`, selected file, context
menu, and its own `TerminalsPane`. Inactive tabs stay mounted (`display: none`),
so switching never disturbs another repo's view state or shells. The main
process keeps one watcher per root and tags `repo:changed` with the root, so
each tab refreshes only its own repository. The tab bar (basename, dirty dot,
close button, `+` to open) sits below the panes, with an empty state when every
tab is closed. `react-resizable-panels` keeps layout state per Group id, so
`RepoTab` suffixes its ids with the root.

Two things the tab shells must not lose. **`min-width: 0`** on `.tab-content`,
`.repo-tab-shell` and `.repo-tab`: a flex item defaults to `min-width: auto`, so
without it a tab is stretched by its own nowrap content — long paths, long
commit subjects — and its panel group ends up wider than the window. The panel
percentages stay correct while the total is wrong, which shows up as one pane
squeezed to a sliver (its header buttons clipped away) and another pushed off
screen entirely. And **`disabled={!active}`** on every Group of a hidden tab:
the library hit-tests the pointer against every registered group, and a
`display: none` group reports a zero-sized rect.

### Hiding panes

`src/renderer/src/panes.ts` holds the `PaneVisibility` record; `App.tsx` owns it
(app-wide, like the other view preferences, persisted under `gitty.panes`) and
`RepoTab` simply does not render a hidden pane's `Panel` — nor the `Separator`
beside it, nor a whole row when both its panes are gone. Two consequences worth
keeping. Panel sizes are stored **per Group id**, so the ids carry the visible
set (`top-fd`, `bottom-lt`); reusing one id for two different child counts
restores sizes that no longer add up. And the last visible pane renders no hide
button — an empty window would leave only the title bar's **Panes** menu as the
way back.

Hiding the terminal pane unmounts `TerminalsPane`, which must not end its
shells. Its split tree therefore lives in a module-level `Map` keyed by root
beside the xterm registry, and sessions are destroyed only by
`destroyTerminals(root)`, which `RepoTab` calls when it unmounts — that is, when
the repository tab closes.

### Recent repositories

`src/main/recent.ts` keeps the list in `app.getPath('userData')` — which is why
`app.setName('Gitty')` runs before anything else, or an unpackaged run would
scatter state into `~/.config/Electron`. Reads filter out paths that no longer
exist, so a deleted repository disappears from the menu on its own. Remembering
is best-effort and never blocks opening a repository.

### The `View` union drives the UI

Each `RepoTab` holds a `View` of four modes — `worktree`, `commit`, `range`,
`snapshot` — and both top panes are derived from it:

| mode | top-left file list | top-right |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `worktree` | uncommitted changes | that file's diff |
| `commit` | files the commit touched | commit diff (whole, or one file) |
| `range` | files changed between two commits | range diff |
| `snapshot` | the entire tree at that commit | that file's contents, read-only |

`selectedFile` narrows the diff within a mode. The commit log's first row is a
pseudo-commit (`WORKTREE_ROW`) standing for the work tree; it joins keyboard
navigation and selecting it returns to `worktree` mode.

### Browsing another branch

The title bar's branch is a menu (`git for-each-ref` over `refs/heads` and
`refs/remotes`) and picking one sets `browsingByRoot[root]` in `App.tsx`, which
each `RepoTab` takes as its `browsing` prop and passes to `git.log` as a ref.
That is the whole feature: **nothing is checked out**. Status, the work tree
pane, its diffs and the shells all still describe the branch git is on, which is
why the work-tree row stays in the log and the title bar shows both names. A
change of branch drops the loaded commits rather than merging two histories,
and clears the selection with them.

`refs/remotes/origin/HEAD` is filtered out by full ref name: its short name is
plain `origin`, which would read as a branch of its own.

Snapshot entries carry a synthetic `gitty:snapshot:<hash>:<path>` absPath, which
has no on-disk existence — that is what the file context menu keys off to route
"Open File" through a temp copy of that revision and to drop "Reveal in File
Manager", which would have nothing to reveal.

### DiffPane

Takes raw unified-diff text and parses it itself. Rows render in chunks of 1500
that grow as the end nears, rather than a fixed-height virtual window: word wrap
and the side-by-side grid both make row heights variable. Inline rows carry
`content-visibility: auto` so off-screen ones cost nothing. Side-by-side zips
each run of deletions with the additions that follow it, one grid row per pair,
so wrapped halves stay aligned. Wrap and view mode persist in `localStorage`
under `gitty.wrap` / `gitty.diffView`.

### Viewing whole files

`fileView` swaps the diff for the file itself. It is deliberately **not**
persisted and is cleared whenever another file or commit is selected: a history
browser defaults to diffs, and viewing a file is an action (double-click, menu,
header toggle) rather than a mode to get stuck in. Snapshot mode forces it on —
a snapshot has no diff. Either way the source comes
from `git.readWorking` in the work tree and `git.snapshotFile` at a revision;
`CodePane` renders it with line numbers, and `MarkdownPane` takes over for `.md`.

`highlight.ts` is shared by both. highlight.js is imported through `lib/core`
with languages registered one by one — the full bundle dwarfs the rest of the
renderer — and its token colours are mapped onto the app palette in CSS rather
than importing one of its themes. `highlightLines` exists because highlight.js
emits one blob whose spans run across newlines (block comments, template
literals): it walks the output keeping the stack of open spans, so each line can
be its own element without broken markup.

In `MarkdownPane`, markdown-it runs with `html: false` so raw HTML stays inert
without a sanitiser; heading ids are assigned on the token stream before
rendering, so the outline and the document cannot disagree; front matter is
sliced off first, since markdown-it would read `---` as a horizontal rule; and
link clicks are intercepted, because a plain `<a>` navigation would replace the
whole app window.

Full screen is a `position: fixed` class on the pane rather than a different
tree, deliberately: unmounting the layout would dispose the terminal's pty and
kill whatever is running in it.

### Terminal

The pane splits, so ptys are kept in a `Map` keyed by a session id the renderer
mints (`src/main/index.ts`), and every `terminal:*` message names its session.
A disposed session goes silent so its exit notice cannot land in the terminal
that replaced it, and a reload disposes them all — the ids that could reach
them are gone with the old renderer.

`TerminalsPane` holds the split as a tree: a leaf is one shell, a branch shares
its area between children, and splitting the same way twice extends the branch
instead of nesting. Changing the set of children remounts its `Group` so the
panels share out evenly again, which is only affordable because **the xterm
instances live outside React** — a module-level registry in `TerminalPane.tsx`
owns the DOM node and the terminal, and the component merely re-parents that
node. Unmounting a real xterm would take the running shell with it, and every
split moves terminals between panels. Sessions therefore end only in
`destroySession`: **Close**, a shell that exited, or the tab's `TerminalsPane`
unmounting (closing the repository tab).

### Refresh

`src/main/watcher.ts` watches the work tree recursively, filters `.git` down to
the few paths that matter (`HEAD`, `index`, `refs/`, …) plus build-output noise,
and debounces into a `repo:changed` event tagged with the root. The main process
keeps one watcher per open repository in a `Map`; closing a tab (`repo:close`)
stops that root's watcher. Each `RepoTab` reloads status and log only for its own
root. Watching is best-effort; the manual refresh path must keep working if it
fails.

## Gotchas

- **`react-resizable-panels` v4** exports `Group` / `Panel` / `Separator` with
  an `orientation` prop — not the v3 `PanelGroup` / `PanelResizeHandle` names
  that most examples and model priors show. Sizes are strings like `"55%"`.
- **TypeScript 7** removed `baseUrl`; path aliases must be relative.
- **vite must stay on 7.x** — electron-vite 5 peers on `^5 || ^6 || ^7`.
- **An application menu must exist.** Without one Chromium binds no edit
  accelerators at all and Ctrl+C on selected diff text silently does nothing.
  The menu bar itself is hidden (`autoHideMenuBar`).
- **Linux runs with `ELECTRON_DISABLE_SANDBOX=1`** (set by `run.sh`);
  `chrome-sandbox` cannot keep a root-owned setuid bit inside `node_modules`.
- The repository to open is resolved as `$GITTY_REPO`, else the first argv entry
  that is a directory (argv also holds the electron binary and the entry
  script), else cwd.

## Conventions

- Keep `CHANGELOG.md` current (Keep a Changelog format). Released versions are
  tagged `vX.Y.Z` with a matching GitHub release; put new work under
  `## [Unreleased]`, not into a published section.
- Comments explain why, not what — the existing ones mark git format quirks and
  layout constraints that are not obvious from the code.
