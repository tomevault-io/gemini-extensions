# Lamium agent guide

Lamium is a client-side quality-of-life mod for Minecraft Bedrock on
LeviLamina Client (Windows x64, C++20, clang-cl, xmake). This file is the
working manual for any coding agent (Claude Code, Pi, OpenCode, ...).
Read it fully before changing code.

- Product direction, UI rules and colors: [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md)
- What to work on, in what order, and who should do it: [docs/BACKLOG.md](docs/BACKLOG.md)
  (release rules and pre-release checks are in it; finished items:
  [docs/BACKLOG-DONE.md](docs/BACKLOG-DONE.md))
- What works in game and what is unchecked, per feature: [docs/VALIDATION.md](docs/VALIDATION.md)
  (the evidence behind it: [docs/VALIDATION-LOG.md](docs/VALIDATION-LOG.md))
- Per-feature technical notes: `docs/*.md` (CAMERA, OVERLAYS, RESTRICTIONS,
  HAND-RESTOCK, EQUIPMENT, ...)
- Distribution/package contract: [docs/DISTRIBUTION.md](docs/DISTRIBUTION.md)
- UI mockups agreed with the maintainer: `docs/demos/` (see its README)
- Machine-specific paths (instance folder etc.): `AGENTS.local.md` if present.
  It is gitignored; never copy its contents into tracked files.

The repository is the source of truth for work: everything needed to pick up
a task is in this file and `docs/`. Start with BACKLOG.md's short
**Current execution order**, then read the selected L-item and its feature doc.
The L-item is authoritative if a summary ever drifts. If a decision made in
chat affects implementation, write it into DESIGN.md or BACKLOG.md.

BACKLOG-DONE.md and VALIDATION-LOG.md are long, append-only records. Do not
read them whole: search them for the L-number or feature you need
(`git grep -n "L-66" docs/BACKLOG-DONE.md docs/VALIDATION-LOG.md`).

## Talking to the user

- Reply in the user's language. Code, comments, commit messages and repo
  docs are English.
- The user tests in Minecraft. You cannot. Every change that touches game
  behavior ends with a short checklist: what to do in game and what they
  should see. Say which build (commit and DLL SHA-256) they are testing.
- Do not claim runtime behavior you have not seen confirmed. "Builds and
  tests pass" is not "works in game".

## Build, test, deploy

```bash
xmake f -a x64 -m release -p windows --target_type=client -y   # once
xmake build Lamium            # DLL -> bin/Lamium/Lamium.dll (+ .pdb, manifest.json)
xmake build LamiumTests && xmake run LamiumTests               # pure tests
xmake build LamiumNativeTests && xmake run LamiumNativeTests   # SDK-type tests
```

- Run `LamiumTests` after every change. It must print no failures.
- Deploy only when the user wants to test: Minecraft must be closed
  (`tasklist | grep -i Minecraft.Windows` prints nothing), otherwise the DLL
  copy fails. Copy `bin/Lamium/Lamium.dll`, `Lamium.pdb`, `manifest.json` into
  `<instance>/mods/Lamium/` and report the SHA-256 of both copies.
- Debug traces are xmake options (`xmake f --camera_trace=y` etc., see
  `xmake.lua`). Never deploy or commit with a trace option left on unless the
  user asked for a trace build. Reset with `xmake f --camera_trace=n ...`.
- Runtime log: `<instance>/mods/Lamium/logs/lamium.log`.
- Search with `git grep` or limit searches to `src tests docs`. `build/` holds
  full SDK source copies; a plain recursive grep over it takes minutes.
- SDK headers (read-only reference for game types): the xmake package cache,
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%/.xmake/packages/l/levilamina-client-sdk/26.51.5/*/include/mc/...`.
  Search there before guessing a member or function name.

### Windows shell pitfalls

- `python3` is a Store stub; use `python`.
- Write multi-line files with the file-writing tool, not bash heredocs with
  quotes/backticks inside.
- Files are UTF-8 (Japanese strings in `src/ui/Translations.h`). Tools like
  perl need `-Mutf8`/`-CSD` or they corrupt text; prefer the edit tool.

## Architecture in one page

```
src/app        Runtime (feature lifecycle, logging, settings access)
src/settings   Settings struct, option catalog (Options.h), JSON store
src/input      Actions and default keys (Binding.h), dispatch (Actions.cpp)
src/ui         Settings screen, Shapes view, widgets, layout math, translations
src/overlay    World-space geometry (pure) and rendering (WorldOverlay.cpp)
src/features   camera / information / inspection / interaction / inventory /
               lighting / visuals — one folder per area, hooks live here
tests          Pure unit tests (no game types). tests-native: SDK-type tests
```

Rules the code already follows; keep them:

1. **Pure logic in headers, game glue in .cpp.** Layout, geometry, planning
   and state machines live in `*.h` with no Minecraft types and are covered
   in `tests/`. Hooks and rendering call into them. When adding behavior,
   first ask "which part can be a pure function with a test?".
2. **No game pointers kept across frames.** Collect owned values each frame.
   Key and mouse events arrive from the window procedure, outside the client
   tick: never touch game state there. `input/CustomInput.cpp` queues actions
   and runs them on the client thread (touching inventories from the event
   crashed Minecraft).
3. **Every feature restores vanilla behavior** when disabled, on world exit,
   dimension change and focus loss.
4. **Settings**: add a field in `Settings.h`, an entry in `Options.h`, load/save
   in `SettingsStore.cpp` (tolerate missing keys), a row in `SettingsRows.h`,
   and English + Japanese strings in `Translations.h`. `SettingsStoreTests`
   and `TranslationsTest` catch most omissions.
5. **Actions**: append to `enum Action` and `actions` in `Binding.h` (never
   reorder; ids are saved), map toggles in `ToggleAction.h`, handle presses in
   `Actions.cpp`. Behavior (Press/Hold/Toggle) is decided by the action.
6. **Translations**: English is the default, Japanese is required for every
   key. No Chinese unless requested.
7. **UI** draws only rectangles and text through `src/ui/Widgets.h`. Use the
   palette and widgets there; do not invent colors or sizes. See DESIGN.md.
8. **Engineering behavior** (DESIGN.md, the authoritative wording): bound
   expensive scans and uploads per frame/tick, discard stale async results by
   world/dimension generation, confirm gameplay mutations from authoritative
   state rather than a return value or sent transaction, and fail open to
   vanilla when a version-sensitive path cannot be verified.

## Code style

- Match surrounding code: terse, few comments, comments explain *why*.
- C++20, no exceptions across hook boundaries (`noexcept` handlers catch).
- Tests use `check(bool, "what must hold")` in `tests/*Tests.cpp`, declared and
  called from `main` in `tests/CameraTests.cpp`.
- Do not copy code, strings, assets, distinctive constants or implementation
  structure from other mods. [docs/PROVENANCE.md](docs/PROVENANCE.md) lists
  the reference-only projects (do not open their source while writing Lamium
  code) and what to record before any outside code is incorporated.
- Specs describe Lamium's behavior in Lamium's terms, not "like mod X". Name
  another mod or prior-art project only in PROVENANCE.md, as a one-line source
  for a Research hypothesis, in a clean-room boundary ("do not open X"), or in
  a dated decision record of what the maintainer referred to. Tools and
  platforms Lamium depends on (LeviLamina, LIP, Bedrinth) are named freely.
  Comparisons and surveys stay out of the repository. Do not rewrite
  historical records (BACKLOG-DONE.md, VALIDATION-LOG.md).

## Git

- Follow the user's branch and push preferences (see `AGENTS.local.md`);
  otherwise work on a branch and do not push without being asked.
- One logical change per commit. Subject: English, imperative, sentence case,
  no prefix, ~70 chars (e.g. "Pull shapes slightly toward the eye to stop
  flicker inside blocks"). Body only when the why is not obvious.
- Commit only when build + LamiumTests pass. Push when the user asks or after
  they confirm a runtime check.
- Update the relevant `docs/*.md` in the same or next commit when behavior or
  validation status changes. A game result goes on top of VALIDATION-LOG.md
  (build, hash, environment, what was and was not seen) and updates the
  feature's row in VALIDATION.md. Keep both factual: verified vs not.
- A finished L-item moves to BACKLOG-DONE.md (under its kind); anything left
  for the release goes to BACKLOG's "Pre-release checks".

## When to stop and escalate

Cheap models: stop, write down what you found, and hand back to the user
(who may bring in a stronger model) when any of these happens:

- The task is marked **Design** or **Research** in BACKLOG.md, or the spec
  leaves a user-visible choice open. Do not decide product/UX questions.
- You need a game function you cannot find in the SDK headers, or the same
  hook approach failed twice at runtime.
- A fix would change settings file format, action ids, or delete user data.
- Two build/test attempts in a row fail for reasons you do not understand.
- The change touches more than ~5 files outside the task's listed files.

Hand-back note format: goal, what you changed (commits), what you observed
(test output, logs), the open question, and your best next guess.
