# Aegis — DAG-based Deterministic Context Compiler

## Architecture

Aegis is an MCP server that compiles deterministic context for AI coding agents.
Instead of RAG (retrieval-augmented generation), it uses a DAG (directed acyclic graph)
of edges to resolve exactly which documents an agent needs for a given set of target files.

## Running

```bash
npm run build          # compile TypeScript
npm run start:agent    # start agent surface (default: ./aegis.db)
npm run start:admin    # start admin surface
npm test               # run all tests
```

## Agent Surface Tools (6 tools)

- `aegis_compile_context` — Primary tool. Given target_files, returns deterministic context.
- `aegis_observe` — Record observations (compile_miss, review_correction, pr_merged, manual_note, document_import, doc_gap_detected).
- `aegis_get_compile_audit` — Retrieve audit log of a past compile invocation.
- `aegis_get_known_tags` — List distinct intent tags (approved-resolvable) with `knowledge_version` and SHA-256 `tag_catalog_hash` for client caching.
- `aegis_workspace_status` — Read-only workspace snapshot (recent compile regions, unresolved compile_miss backlog, pending proposal count).
- `aegis_init_detect` — Analyze a project to generate initialization preview (read-only).

## Admin Surface Tools (18 additional tools, 24 total)

- `aegis_init_confirm` — Confirm initialization using preview_hash from init_detect.
- `aegis_list_proposals` / `aegis_get_proposal` — Review pending proposals.
- `aegis_approve_proposal` / `aegis_reject_proposal` — Approve or reject with optional modifications.
- `aegis_preflight_proposal_bundle` / `aegis_approve_proposal_bundle` — Validate or approve pending proposals sharing a `bundle_id`.
- `aegis_check_upgrade` — Check for template version upgrades.
- `aegis_apply_upgrade` — Generate proposals for template upgrade changes.
- `aegis_archive_observations` — Archive old observations.
- `aegis_get_stats` — Aggregate knowledge counts and health signals.
- `aegis_list_observations` — List observations with outcome-based filtering (proposed / skipped / pending).
- `aegis_import_doc` — Import a document into Canonical Knowledge (from `content` or `file_path`).
- `aegis_analyze_doc` / `aegis_analyze_import_batch` — ADR-015 import-plan analysis (read-only).
- `aegis_execute_import_plan` — Materialize analyzed import plans as proposal bundles.
- `aegis_process_observations` — Trigger observation analysis pipeline for pending observations.
- `aegis_sync_docs` — Synchronize imported documents with their source files.

## Key Invariants

- **INV-6**: Agent surface cannot modify Canonical Knowledge. Admin tools are not registered on agent surface.
- **P-1**: All context compilation is deterministic. Same input + same knowledge_version = same output.
- **P-3**: All Canonical mutations require human approval (Observation → Proposed → Canonical).

## Tag Mappings Layer (Outside Canonical DAG)

- **Storage**: `tag_mappings` table — separate from Canonical Knowledge, no approval workflow
- **CRUD**: Direct repository methods (`upsertTagMapping`, `setTagMappings`, `getDocumentsByTags`, etc.)
- **Approved filter**: `getDocumentsByTags` JOIN-filters on `documents.status = 'approved'`
- **Source**: `slm` (small language model) or `manual` (human-curated)
- **IntentTagger port**: `extractTags(plan) → IntentTag[]` (async, FakeTagger for tests, OllamaIntentTagger for production)
- **Wired to ContextCompiler**: `plan` + tagger → expanded context via tag_mappings lookup

## Adapter Meta (Outside Canonical Knowledge)

- **Storage**: `adapter_meta` table — separate from Canonical Knowledge, no approval workflow
- **Same pattern as**: `tag_mappings` (operational metadata, direct CRUD)
- **Purpose**: Track the package version that last ran a full `deploy-adapters`
- **Written by**: `deploy-adapters` CLI only (full deploy, no `--targets`, no failures)
- **Read by**: MCP server startup (to set `adapterOutdated` flag for `notices`)

```

## Design Decisions

- Agent surface registers 6 tools (compile_context, observe, get_compile_audit, get_known_tags, workspace_status, init_detect)
- Admin surface registers 24 tools (the 6 agent tools + 18 admin-only)
- init_detect is on both surfaces (read-only). init_confirm is admin-only (mutates Canonical)
- init_confirm must run in the admin process (previewCache is in-memory)
- After init_confirm, adapters are auto-deployed (.cursor/rules/, AGENTS.md) — non-fatal if deployment fails
- SQLite + recursive CTE for DAG traversal (no graph DB needed)
- content_hash is always server-computed (never trust client-provided hashes)
- observe events are validated per event_type at service boundary
- Automation: `compile_miss` → `add_edge` (RuleBasedAnalyzer), `review_correction` → `update_doc` (ReviewCorrectionAnalyzer)
- `review_correction` requires both `target_doc_id` + `proposed_content` for automation (otherwise skipped)
- `pr_merged` → `add_edge` for uncovered paths (PrMergedAnalyzer)
- `manual_note` → `update_doc` or `new_doc` depending on hints (ManualNoteAnalyzer)
- Ollama integration for SLM-powered intent tagging with graceful degradation
- Template upgrade detection and proposal generation via `check_upgrade` / `apply_upgrade`
- **Bootstrap proposal has no evidence**: `proposal_type='bootstrap'` is the sole exception to P-3's "1+ Observation per Proposal" rule. Bootstrap proposals are created by the init engine, not derived from observations. This is an intentional design decision — init is a controlled bootstrapping process, not an observation-driven workflow.

## Aegis Process Enforcement

You MUST consult Aegis for every coding-related interaction — implementation tasks AND questions about architecture, patterns, or conventions. No exceptions.

### When Writing Code

1. **Create a Plan** — Before touching any file, articulate what you intend to do.
2. **Tag catalog (recommended once per session)** — Call `aegis_get_known_tags` to list approved-resolvable tags and obtain `knowledge_version` and `tag_catalog_hash` for caching. Call again when the catalog hash changes.
3. **Consult Aegis** — Call `aegis_compile_context` with:
   - `target_files`: the files you plan to edit
   - `plan`: your natural-language plan (optional but recommended)
   - `command`: the type of operation (scaffold, refactor, review, etc.)
   - `intent_tags` (recommended): tags chosen from the step-2 catalog — drives `expanded` context deterministically. Use `[]` to skip expanded context without using the server-side SLM tagger. Omit `intent_tags` only if you want the server SLM tagger (when enabled) to infer tags from `plan` instead (see ADR-004).
4. **Read and follow** the returned architecture guidelines.
   - `delivery: "inline"` — content is included; read it directly.
   - `delivery: "deferred"` — content is NOT included. You MUST Read the file via `source_path` before proceeding. Prioritize by `relevance` score (high first); skip only documents with very low relevance (< 0.25) unless specifically needed.
   - `delivery: "omitted"` — excluded by budget or policy. Increase `max_inline_bytes` or use `content_mode: "always"` if needed.
5. **Self-Review** — After writing code, check your implementation against the returned guidelines.
6. **Report Compile Misses** — If Aegis failed to provide a needed guideline:
   ```
   aegis_observe({
     event_type: "compile_miss",
     related_compile_id: "<from compile_context>",
     related_snapshot_id: "<from compile_context>",
     payload: {
       target_files: ["<files>"],
       review_comment: "<what was missing or insufficient>",
       target_doc_id: "<optional: base.documents[*].doc_id whose content was insufficient>",
       missing_doc: "<optional: doc_id that should have been returned but was not>"
     }
   })
   ```
   - `target_doc_id`: A doc_id from the **base.documents** section of the compile result whose content was insufficient. Do NOT use expanded or template doc_ids.
   - `missing_doc`: A doc_id that should have been included in the compile result but was absent.
   - If neither can be identified, `review_comment` alone is sufficient.

### When Answering Questions

If the user asks about architecture, patterns, conventions, or how to write code — even without requesting implementation:

1. **Identify representative files** — Find 1–3 real file paths in the codebase that are relevant to the question (e.g. `modules/Member/Application/Member/UpdateMemberInteractor.php`). Use directory listings or search if needed. Do NOT guess paths or use directories. **Do NOT read the files** — Aegis already has the relevant guidelines; reading files wastes tokens.
2. **Consult Aegis** — Call `aegis_compile_context` with:
   - `target_files`: the real file paths from step 1
   - `plan`: the user's question in natural language
   - `command`: `"review"`
   - `intent_tags` (optional): when `expanded` context is useful, call `aegis_get_known_tags` first, then pass a subset of tags (or `[]` to skip expanded).
3. **Answer using Aegis context** — Base your answer on the guidelines returned by Aegis, supplemented by your own knowledge. Cite specific guidelines when relevant. When documents include a `relevance` score, prioritize high-scoring documents and skim or skip low-scoring ones.

### When Knowledge Base Is Empty

If `aegis_compile_context` returns no documents, the knowledge base has not been populated yet.
Ask the user to run initial setup using the **admin surface** with `aegis_import_doc` to add architecture documents with `edge_hints`.

### Rules

- NEVER skip the Aegis consultation step — for both implementation and questions.
- NEVER ignore guidelines returned by Aegis.
- The compile_id and snapshot_id from the consultation are required for observation reporting.
