# AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md and GEMINI.md

Guidance for Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and OpenAI Codex when working in this repository.

## Repo Facts

- CoCalc-ai source monorepo (TypeScript-heavy) under `src/packages`.
- Workspace management uses pnpm (`src/packages/pnpm-workspace.yaml`).
- Prefer package-local changes and checks over full-repo commands when possible.

## Security Issues

- Before investigating or fixing a suspected vulnerability, read
  [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md).
- Never disclose suspected vulnerability details in a public issue,
  discussion, pull request, commit, or branch before coordinated deployment or
  explicit maintainer approval.
- Use a draft GitHub repository security advisory and its temporary private
  fork for non-public fixes. Do not push the fix to the public repository
  until deployment is coordinated.
- If a security issue is discovered during unrelated work, stop before making
  the details public and alert the user or repository maintainers privately.

## Preferred Commands

- Run these from the repo root unless a command says otherwise.
- Full dev build: `pnpm -C src build:dev`
- Full typecheck: `pnpm -C src tsc`
- Dev/browser environment bootstrap:
  - Lite: `cd src && pnpm dev:lite:env` to print the environment for lite development and browser automation, including the correct `COCALC_API_URL` (typically port `7001`), browser session, and PATH updates. Use `eval "$(pnpm -s dev:lite:env)"` to apply it to the current shell.
  - Hub / full multi-user launchpad: `cd src && pnpm dev:hub:env` to print the corresponding environment for hub-backed development. Use `eval "$(pnpm -s dev:hub:env)"` to apply it to the current shell.
- Prettier (repo-pinned): `pnpm -C src prettier --write <file>`
- Frontend lint (fast): `pnpm -C src lint:frontend`
- Package typecheck (fast): `cd src/packages/<pkg> && pnpm tsc --build`
- Package build: `cd src/packages/<pkg> && pnpm build`
- For `next` / `static`: use `pnpm -C src build:dev` instead of `pnpm -C src build`
- Tests: run focused package/tests first; avoid full test suite unless needed
- Dependency consistency check: `pnpm -C src version-check`

### Fresh Worktrees

- A new git worktree does not have built workspace package outputs. Before running package tests, run `pnpm -C src install`, then build/typecheck the target package (for example, `cd src/packages/<pkg> && pnpm tsc --build`) so TypeScript project references produce their `dist` entrypoints.
- Do not run Jest first in a fresh worktree: imports such as `@cocalc/cloud` can fail misleadingly when the linked workspace package exists but has not been built.
- Use `pnpm -C src build:dev` when preparing a release or when the required dependency scope is unclear; otherwise prefer the package-local build before focused tests.

## Live Hub Env

- Before running live Lite/Launchpad control-plane commands such as `cocalc host ...`, `cocalc project ...`, or browser-driven validation against the local dev hub, refresh the hub env first:
  - `cd src && eval "$(pnpm -s dev:hub:env)"`
- Do this again after restarting the hub, switching between local hub instances, or resuming a stale shell. Otherwise `cocalc` can silently use outdated credentials and fail with misleading auth/control-plane errors.
- When a task depends on upgrading hosts or validating live project-host behavior, assume this step is required unless the current shell definitely just ran it.
- For dangerous CLI operations that require fresh auth in local dev, use `cocalc auth elevate --dev` when the local hub password and database are available. This bootstraps a cookie-backed dev fresh-auth session; raw bearer, API-key, or hub-password auth alone will still fail fresh-auth checks.

## Live Site CLI Auth

- For live staging/prod control-plane work that needs browser-approved fresh auth, use the repo-built one-line bootstrap and wait for the user to approve the printed URLs:
  - Staging: `cd src && node packages/cli/dist/bin/cocalc.js --profile staging --api https://staging.cocalc.ai auth bootstrap --email wstein@gmail.com`
  - Prod: `cd src && node packages/cli/dist/bin/cocalc.js --profile prod --api https://cocalc.ai auth bootstrap --email wstein@gmail.com`
- `auth bootstrap` performs browser login, browser-approved elevation, and `auth status --check` equivalent validation. Elevation lasts 8 hours by default; use `auth elevate --short` only when a short 15-minute window is intentional.
- Do not try to satisfy fresh-auth requirements with API keys, bearer tokens, hub-password auth, or project-scoped credentials. Dangerous operator/admin mutations need a cookie-backed interactive CLI session.

## Live Lite / Browser Env

- Before using `cocalc browser ...` or other live browser automation against the local Lite or Launchpad dev servers, always load the matching env in the current shell:
  - Lite: `cd src && eval "$(pnpm -s dev:lite:env)"`
  - Hub: `cd src && eval "$(pnpm -s dev:hub:env)"`
- This is not optional for reliable targeting. The env sets the correct `COCALC_API_URL`, browser session, project id, auth token, and PATH.
- If the wrong env is loaded, `cocalc browser` can fail with misleading errors, e.g. trying to use hub/project-host resolution against Lite, or targeting the wrong browser session entirely.
- If `cocalc browser ...` fails with `no auth cookie set` in a local public dev site such as `lite1b.cocalc.ai`, remember that the site is backed by the local loopback hub and local PostgreSQL. Use the repo-built CLI against the loopback hub to bootstrap dev fresh auth, then retry browser commands through that same loopback API:
  - `cd src && eval "$(pnpm -s dev:hub:env)"`
  - `node packages/cli/dist/bin/cocalc.js --api http://localhost:9100 auth elevate --dev`
  - `node packages/cli/dist/bin/cocalc.js --api http://localhost:9100 browser session list --json`
  - `node packages/cli/dist/bin/cocalc.js --api http://localhost:9100 browser files --project-id <project-id> --browser <browser-id>`
- The browser session URL may still be `https://lite1b.cocalc.ai/...` while the API origin is `http://localhost:9100`; this mismatch is expected for these public-fronted local dev sites. See `src/.agents/lite4b-setup-notes-2026-05-05.md` for the longer operational notes and caveats.

## Hard Rules (CoCalc-Specific)

- Use `@cocalc/*` absolute imports for cross-package imports.
- Use `import type` for type-only imports.
- For theme-aware frontend UI, use `UI_COLORS` from `@cocalc/util/appearance-palette`, not fixed `COLORS` values or ad-hoc color literals. Pair semantic foreground/background tokens and check both light and dark mode. Prefer the existing Ant Design theme for standard controls; do not override their colors unnecessarily. See [UI colors and appearance](docs/STYLE.md#ui-colors-and-appearance).
- Reserve literal `COLORS` from `@cocalc/util/theme` for intentionally fixed colors (such as branding or authored content). APIs requiring concrete colors, such as canvas/chart renderers, must use resolved palette values rather than CSS-variable strings; do not redefine `COLORS` to be theme-dependent.
- Use package logging utilities (`getLogger`) for persistent logging; avoid `console.log` except temporary debugging.
- Prefer Conat RPC APIs (`src/packages/conat/hub/api`) over Next API routes in `src/packages/next/pages/api/v2`.
- For direct DB access in hub/backend, use `getPool()` from `@cocalc/database/pool`.
- Keep dependency versions aligned across packages; update matching `@types/*` packages when applicable.
- Redux store values are deep-converted with Immutable.js at runtime. Do not assume nested values returned by `useTypedRedux` are plain objects just because the TypeScript type says so; normalize or use `.get(...)`/`.toJS()` before nested property access.
- For admin site-settings secret/password configuration fields, use `src/packages/frontend/admin/site-settings/secret-setting-input.tsx` instead of raw password inputs or custom stored-secret notes.
- Before adding or substantially changing first-party frontend UI, read `src/.agents/accessibility.md`.
- For changed interactive UI, run `pnpm -C src lint:frontend` and add focused accessibility coverage as described in `src/.agents/accessibility.md`.

## Multibay Architecture Rule

- Before changing auth, accounts, billing, projects, collaborators, hosts, project files, backups, secrets, public sharing, or Conat control-plane APIs, read `src/.agents/scalable-architecture.md`.
- Treat Launchpad as the one-bay special case of the same architecture, not a separate architecture.
- Always ask: which bay is authoritative for this data or action?
- Route by explicit ownership: account `home_bay_id`, project `owning_bay_id`, and host `bay_id`.
- Do not assume the local bay/database is authoritative unless the code has resolved ownership or is documented as one-bay-only.
- Cross-bay project operations must use the inter-bay/project-host routing layer, not direct local DB/project-host shortcuts.
- For project-to-project operations, assume source and destination projects may belong to different bays unless the operation explicitly requires same-host/same-bay semantics.
- Keep the control plane and data plane separate: hubs/bays authorize, route, synchronize state, and issue scoped project-host access, but steady-state project traffic such as files, terminals, Jupyter, Codex, previews, and app/server proxying should flow directly between the user/client and the project host whenever possible.
- Do not proxy project data through the hub/control plane unless there is a documented reason. If a new access mode needs different permissions, prefer a distinct project-host subject/service with narrower capabilities over hub-mediated data access.

## Git and Validation

- By default, agents should auto-commit completed change-sets after relevant validation passes.
- The default workflow is: make the change, run the relevant checks, commit, then let the user review and request follow-up fixes in a new commit if needed.
- Do not wait for an explicit "commit" request unless the user asked not to commit, the work is clearly exploratory/incomplete, or there are unrelated worktree changes that would make an automatic commit unsafe.
- Commit messages should be prefixed by area/package, e.g. `frontend/chat: ...`.
- By default, write commit messages with:
  - a concise first line (subject), and
  - a detailed markdown body explaining details of the commit, which is more succinct than the agent turn summary, including only information that is valuable longterm.
  - do not include a dedicated `Tests and validation` section; mention verification only when it adds long-term value.
  - do not embed literal escaped newlines (e.g. `\n` or `\\n`) in commit messages.
  - For multiline commit messages, always use stdin/heredoc or a message file instead of `git commit -m`.
  - In `exec_command` / shell tool calls, do not rely on quoted `\n` sequences to create commit-message line breaks; use literal newlines in the heredoc body.
  - Safe default pattern:

```
git commit -F - <<'EOF'
<subject line>

<body>
EOF
```

- `git commit -m` is only for subject-only commits with no body.
- Prefer follow-up commits over amending or rewriting history unless the user explicitly asks for that.
- For new source files that use the standard CoCalc file header comment, set the copyright year to the current year.
- Before finishing a change-set, run relevant typecheck/tests for touched packages.
- Run `pnpm -C src prettier --write <file>` on modified files as needed.
- For frontend changes, also run `pnpm -C src lint:frontend`. Treat frontend lint failures the same way as test or typecheck failures.
