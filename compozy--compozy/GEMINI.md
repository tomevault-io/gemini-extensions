This file provides project guidance for coding agents working in this repository.

## HIGH PRIORITY

- **IF YOU DON'T CHECK SKILLS** your task will be invalidated and we will generate rework
- **YOU CAN ONLY** finish a task if `make verify` passes at 100% (runs `fmt + lint + test + build`). No exceptions — failing any of these commands means the task is **NOT COMPLETE**
- **`make lint` has zero tolerance**. **Zero issues allowed** — any golangci-lint issue is a blocking failure
- **ALWAYS** check dependent package APIs before writing integration code or tests to avoid writing wrong code
- **NEVER** use workarounds — always use the `no-workarounds` skill for any fix/debug task + `testing-anti-patterns` for tests
- **ALWAYS** use the `no-workarounds` and `systematic-debugging` skills when fixing bugs or complex issues
- **NEVER** use web search tools to search local project code — for local code, use Grep/Glob instead
- **YOU SHOULD NEVER** add dependencies by hand in `go.mod` — always use `go get` instead

## MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS

- **MUST** run `make verify` before completing ANY subtask
- **ALWAYS USE** the `golang-pro` skill before writing any Go code
- **ALWAYS USE** the `systematic-debugging` + `no-workarounds` skills before fixing any bug
- **ALWAYS USE** the `testing-anti-patterns` skill before writing or modifying tests
- **ALWAYS USE** the `cy-final-verify` skill before claiming any task is done
- **Skipping any verification check will result in IMMEDIATE TASK REJECTION**

## Project Overview

Compozy is a Go module and CLI that drives the full lifecycle of AI-assisted development. It covers product ideation (PRD creation), technical specification, task breakdown with codebase-informed enrichment, and automated execution of each task via AI coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, Droid, Cursor). It also handles PR review remediation workflows.

## Build & Development Commands

```bash
# Full verification pipeline (BLOCKING GATE for any change)
make verify              # Serial: fmt -> lint -> test -> build

# Individual steps
make fmt                 # Format with gofmt
make lint                # Strict golangci-lint (zero issues tolerance)
make test                # Run tests with -race flag
make build               # Compile binary

# Dependency management
make deps                # Tidy and verify modules
```

## CRITICAL: Git Commands Restriction

- **ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN**: **NEVER** run `git restore`, `git checkout`, `git reset`, `git clean`, `git rm`, or any other git commands that modify or discard working directory changes **WITHOUT EXPLICIT USER PERMISSION**
- **DATA LOSS RISK**: These commands can **PERMANENTLY LOSE CODE CHANGES** and cannot be easily recovered
- **REQUIRED ACTION**: If you need to revert or discard changes, **YOU MUST ASK THE USER FIRST**
- If the worktree contains unexpected edits, read them and work around them; do not revert them

## Code Search and Discovery

- **TOOL HIERARCHY**: Use tools in this order:
  1. **Grep** / **Glob** — preferred for local project code
  2. **`find-docs` skill** — for external Go libraries and framework documentation
  3. **Web search tools** — for web research, latest news, code examples
- **FORBIDDEN**: Never use web search tools for local project code

## Coding Style

- Format with `make fmt` and lint with `make lint`.
- Prefer explicit error returns with wrapped context using `fmt.Errorf("context: %w", err)`.
- Use `errors.Is()` and `errors.As()` for error matching; do not compare error strings.
- No `panic()` or `log.Fatal()` in production paths; reserve these for truly unrecoverable startup failures only.
- Use `log/slog` for structured logging. Do not use `log.Printf` or `fmt.Println` for operational output.
- Pass `context.Context` as the first argument to all functions crossing runtime boundaries; avoid `context.Background()` outside `main` and focused tests.
- Design small, focused interfaces; accept interfaces, return structs.
- Use functional options pattern for complex constructors.
- Use compile-time interface verification: `var _ Interface = (*Type)(nil)`.
- Do not use `interface{}`/`any` when a concrete type is known.
- Do not use reflection without performance justification.
- Keep comments short and focused on intent, invariants, or protocol edge cases.

## Testing

- Table-driven tests with subtests (`t.Run`) as the default pattern.
- Use `t.Parallel()` for independent subtests.
- Use `t.TempDir()` for filesystem isolation instead of manual temp directory management.
- Mark test helper functions with `t.Helper()` so stack traces point to the caller.
- Run tests with `-race` flag; the race detector must pass before committing.
- Mock dependencies via interfaces, not test-only methods in production code.
- Prefer root-cause fixes in failing tests over workarounds that mask the real issue.

## Architecture

### Concurrency discipline

- Every goroutine must have explicit ownership and shutdown via `context.Context` cancellation.
- No fire-and-forget goroutines; track all goroutines with `sync.WaitGroup` or equivalent.
- Use `select` with `ctx.Done()` in all long-running goroutine loops.
- Prefer channel-based communication over shared memory with mutexes when practical.
- Use `sync.RWMutex` for read-heavy shared state, `sync.Mutex` for write-heavy.

### Runtime discipline

- Keep the system single-binary and local-first.
- Introduce sidecars or external control planes only with a written techspec.
- Keep execution paths deterministic and observable.

## Agent Skill Dispatch Protocol

Every agent MUST follow this protocol before writing code:

### Step 1: Identify Task Domain

Scan the task description and target files to determine which domains are involved:

- **Go / Runtime** keywords: package, struct, interface, goroutine, channel, context, slog, functional options, constructor, error handling
- **Config** keywords: config, TOML, environment, validation, settings
- **Logging** keywords: logger, logging, slog, log level, observer
- **Bug fix** keywords: bug, fix, error, failure, crash, unexpected, broken, regression
- **Writing tests** keywords: test, spec, mock, stub, fixture, assertion, coverage, table-driven
- **Task completion** keywords: done, complete, finished, ship
- **Architecture audit** keywords: architecture, dead code, code smell, anti-pattern, duplication
- **Creative / new features** keywords: new, feature, design, add, create, implement

### Step 2: Activate All Matching Skills

Use the `Skill` tool to activate every skill that matches the identified domains:

| Domain                  | Required Skills                           | Conditional Skills      |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Go / Runtime            | `golang-pro`                              | `find-docs`             |
| Config                  | `golang-pro`                              |                         |
| Logging                 | `golang-pro`                              |                         |
| Bug fix                 | `systematic-debugging` + `no-workarounds` | `testing-anti-patterns` |
| Writing tests           | `testing-anti-patterns` + `golang-pro`    |                         |
| Task completion         | `cy-final-verify`                         |                         |
| Architecture audit      | `architectural-analysis`                  | `adversarial-review`    |
| Creative / new features | `brainstorming`                           |                         |
| Git rebase/conflicts    | `git-rebase`                              |                         |

### Step 3: Verify Before Completion

Before any agent marks a task as complete:

1. Activate `cy-final-verify` skill
2. Run `make verify`
3. Read and verify the full output — no skipping
4. Only then claim completion

## Anti-Patterns for Agents

**NEVER do these:**

1. **Skip skill activation** because "it's a small change" — every domain change requires its skill
2. **Activate only one skill** when the code touches multiple domains
3. **Forget `cy-final-verify`** before marking tasks done
4. **Write tests without `testing-anti-patterns`** — leads to mock-testing-mocks and production pollution
5. **Fix bugs without `systematic-debugging`** — leads to symptom-patching instead of root cause fixes
6. **Apply workarounds without `no-workarounds`** — type assertions, lint suppressions, error swallowing are rejected
7. **Claim task is done when any check has warnings or errors** — zero warnings, zero errors. No exceptions
8. **Add dependencies by hand in go.mod** — always use `go get`
9. **Use web search tools for local code** — only for external library documentation
10. **Run destructive git commands without permission** — `git restore`, `git reset`, `git clean` require explicit user approval
11. **Use `panic()` or `log.Fatal()` in production handlers** — leads to unrecoverable crashes without cleanup
12. **Fire-and-forget goroutines** — every goroutine must have explicit ownership and shutdown handling
13. **Use `time.Sleep()` in orchestration** — use proper synchronization primitives instead
14. **Ignore errors with `_`** — every error must be handled or have a written justification
15. **Hardcode configuration** — use TOML config or functional options
