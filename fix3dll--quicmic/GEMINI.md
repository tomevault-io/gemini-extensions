# Developer & Agent Guide: QuicMic

This document explains the architecture, design choices, key implementation details, and critical guardrails of the **QuicMic** project. 

---

## 🎙️ Project Overview

**QuicMic** turns a mobile or desktop device's web browser (iOS Safari, Android Chrome, desktop browsers, etc.) into a low-latency wireless PC microphone over a Local Area Network (LAN). 

It consists of:
1. **Frontend (Client):** An HTML5/JS web page that captures mic input via `getUserMedia`, processes it in an `AudioWorklet`, and streams it.
2. **Backend (Server):** A Rust server (using Axum and WTransport) that hosts the web assets, validates client pairing, receives raw audio packets, and plays them into a virtual audio device (such as VB-Cable).

```

### 1. The Audio Path
- **Client Side:** Capture is mono at the browser's native sample rate (typically 48kHz; the actual rate is reported to the server via the `sr` parameter so the output resampler can match it). The `AudioWorklet` (`web/worklet.js`) buffers samples cleanly and sends them to the main thread.
- **Network Packet Format:** Each packet has a 4-byte little-endian sequence number followed by raw `i16` PCM samples (up to 480 samples = 10ms at 48kHz).
- **Server-Side Audio Handling (`audio::decode_into_ring`):** Both transports just parse the little-endian i16 samples and push them into the ring — a pure passthrough on the hot path, with **no per-sample DSP**. The **noise gate** (250ms hold) and **gain** now run client-side in the AudioWorklet (`web/worklet.js`): the gate decides on the raw signal and gain is applied in the float domain before Int16 conversion (no double quantization). So the server never even receives gated-out silence (the phone's radio idles instead). The `noise_gate` / `gain` settings are still stored server-side, only for persistence and cross-device sync (and `latency_threshold`, which is genuinely server-side, still drives the output stage).
- **Ring Buffer (`src/audio/ring_buffer.rs`):** A lock-free, SPSC (Single Producer Single Consumer) ring buffer using `UnsafeCell<i16>` for interior mutability and batch `ptr::copy_nonoverlapping` for efficient memcpy. Uses `Acquire`/`Release` atomic ordering on head/tail pointers for cross-core memory visibility (safe on ARM and x86).
- **Resampling & Channel Mapping:** The `cpal` audio output thread reads from the ring buffer. The output thread:
  - Performs **Catmull-Rom cubic** fractional resampling on the fly to match the target device's native rate (upgraded from linear interpolation, which itself replaced nearest-neighbor/zero-order-hold). The cubic kernel gives a flatter passband and better image/alias rejection on non-48k devices for a few extra multiplies per output sample; it carries a 2-sample group delay from its one-sample look-ahead window.
  - Supports **dynamic source sample rate** via `Arc<AtomicU32>`: the client reports its actual capture rate, and the resampler adjusts the ratio in real-time.
  - Performs **Latency Recovery (Hard Skip)**: If the buffer size exceeds the configurable threshold (converted to samples based on the active client sample rate), the consumer discards the oldest samples down to the prebuffer low-water mark (`PREBUFFER_MS`, ~30ms) to reset the lag instantly. Both the prebuffer mark and this trim target are derived from `PREBUFFER_MS` and the active sample rate, so they stay ~30ms in real time at any source rate (44.1k–192k). A 3-second cooldown prevents stuttering.
  - Duplicates the mono audio channel to all available channels of the virtual audio device.
  - Drains source samples from the ring in small batches (`RESAMPLE_CHUNK`, 64) carried in `ResamplerState`, amortizing the per-sample atomic synchronization. This is a measurable win on weak-memory-model CPUs (ARM / Apple Silicon); on x86 the Acquire/Release loads are already plain `mov`s, so it is behaviour-neutral there. Leftover batch samples persist across callbacks, so none are dropped.
- **Output Supervisor (`spawn_output_supervisor`):** The cpal stream is `!Send`, so a dedicated thread owns its whole lifecycle. If the device fails mid-stream (e.g. the virtual cable is disabled — on Windows this surfaces as WASAPI `AUDCLNT_E_DEVICE_INVALIDATED`), the stream's error callback signals the supervisor over an `mpsc` channel; the supervisor drops the dead stream and rebuilds it, retrying once per second until the device is back, so playback resumes **with no restart**. While the device is down, `StreamState.device_ok` is cleared and reported via `/api/stats` (`audio_device_ok`) so the web UI can warn. The initial build result is reported back to `main`, so a bad `--device` name stays a fatal startup error exactly as before.

## 🔐 TLS & Trust Bypassing on LAN

WebTransport requires a secure HTTPS/QUIC connection. Normally, local IP addresses (like `192.168.1.X`) cannot easily get signed SSL certificates from public authorities (like Let's Encrypt).

To solve this:
1. The server generates a self-signed ECDSA P-256 certificate on-the-fly (`src/tls.rs`) using `wtransport`'s internal builder in memory.
2. The server computes the **SHA-256 hash** of the DER-encoded certificate using `ring`.
3. The client fetches the hash via `/api/info` and configures its `WebTransport` connection with the `serverCertificateHashes` option:
   ```javascript
   new WebTransport(url, {
       serverCertificateHashes: [{ algorithm: 'sha-256', value: hashBytes }],
   });
   ```
4. This allows modern web browsers to establish a secure UDP connection to the local IP without throwing certificate trust errors.
5. Certificate lifetime is 14 days (WebTransport spec maximum for `serverCertificateHashes`).
6. All operations are performed 100% in-memory with zero disk-writes by default. Use `--dump-certs` to export PEM and DER files to `certs/` for debugging.

## 🔄 Concurrency & F5 Refresh Handover (Critical Guardrail)

To prevent resource exhaustion and conflicting streams, the server enforces a **single-connection limit** via `AtomicBool` CAS (Compare-And-Swap). Only one active stream is permitted.

### The Handover Challenge
When a user refreshes the browser page (F5):
1. The browser initiates page unloading, and audio datagrams stop.
2. The server's socket loop (`receive_datagram` or `socket.recv()`) is blocked, waiting for network data or a timeout (which can take seconds to detect).
3. The client immediately tries to establish a *new* connection.
4. If the server does not immediately clear the old session, the new connection is rejected with `"another client is already connected"`.

### The Solution Implementation
We resolved this using a token renewal workflow, CAS-based connection guard, and an event-driven broadcast cancellation channel:

- **Token Renewal (`/api/renew`):** Before initiating a new stream, the client hits `/api/renew`. The server generates a new token, stores it in `session_token`, broadcasts a cancellation signal over `cancel_tx`, and sleeps for 50ms.
- **Broadcast Cancellation (`tokio::select!`):** The session loops listen to `cancel_rx.recv()`. When a cancellation is broadcasted, the old connection instantly breaks its loop and terminates. This eliminates high-frequency timer-wheel allocations on the hot path (which occurred when using a 50ms polling loop) and operates at **0% CPU** during active streaming.
  ```rust
  tokio::select! {
      _ = cancel_rx.recv() => {
          // Terminate session immediately!
      }
      res = receive_datagram() => { ... }
  }
  ```
- **Graceful Shutdown (Ctrl+C):** Deliberately minimal. Clients detect a shutdown by polling the HTTP API — *not* by listening for a transport close frame, because that event is unreliable and arrives seconds late on iOS Safari (verified on-device; see Disconnect Detection below). So the server does not bother sending `1001` close frames or awaiting any close handshake. The main thread simply:
  1. Sets `is_shutdown` to `true`. A small Axum middleware (`reject_during_shutdown`) then replies `503 Service Unavailable` to every new HTTP request — the actual, deterministic "server is leaving" signal.
  2. Broadcasts over `cancel_tx`, so the active session loop breaks and drops its connection (which closes the QUIC/TCP socket on its own — no explicit close call needed).
  3. If a client was connected, keeps the API up for `SHUTDOWN_GRACE_PERIOD` (1200ms) so that client's ~1s liveness poll reliably lands on a `503` before the process exits.
  4. Drains the HTTP server via `axum_handle.graceful_shutdown` and exits.

  An earlier version sent `1001` close frames over both transports and waited on a `shutdown_notify` handshake; that machinery was removed once on-device testing showed iOS ignores the close anyway and detection happens entirely over HTTP.
- **CAS Connection Guard:** New connections use `compare_exchange(false, true, SeqCst, SeqCst)` with retries (10 attempts × 20ms) to atomically acquire the connection slot, eliminating TOCTOU races.
- **RAII ConnectionGuard:** A `Drop`-implementing struct resets `is_connected` to `false` when the active connection task terminates (on completion, cancellation, or panic), freeing the single-connection slot.

## 🔋 Client UI & CPU Optimization (Eco Mode)

Mobile screens (especially during persistent real-time streaming) can heat up or experience battery drain during persistent WebGL/DOM updates.
- **Eco Mode:** A solid black fullscreen overlay shuts off OLED pixels to prevent screen burn-in and save power.
- **Screen Wake Lock:** On entering Eco Mode the client acquires a `navigator.wakeLock('screen')` (and re-acquires it on `visibilitychange`, since the lock is auto-released when the page hides). This keeps JavaScript and the audio/transport sockets alive behind the black overlay — the screen stays on but its OLED pixels are off. Without it, iOS could auto-lock, suspend JS, and never deliver the shutdown signal.
- **Throttled VU Updates:** DOM updates for the VU level and VU bar style are throttled to execute at most once every 100ms (instead of every frame) in `web/app.js`.
- **Suspended Stats UI + Low-Frequency Liveness Check:** When Eco Mode is active, the full per-second stats UI (`updateStats()` body) is suspended — no JSON parsing, DOM updates, or layout while the screen is black. A lightweight liveness check still runs roughly every 3 seconds so a server shutdown is detected (and the user is returned to the pairing screen) without keeping the screen lit. This is the deliberate trade-off that fixed Eco Mode being unresponsive to shutdowns.

## 🎛️ Dynamic Audio Settings (Noise Gate, Gain & Latency Recovery)

Noise gate, gain, and latency recovery threshold can be adjusted at runtime via the web UI or CLI:

- **CLI Defaults:** `--noise-gate -50 --gain 1.0 --latency-threshold 150` sets initial values at startup. `--noise-gate` is specified in **dB** (-100 = Off, 0 = max), matching the web UI slider; `main::noise_gate_db_to_linear` converts it to the linear amplitude the audio thread and HTTP API use (so the stored/synced value stays linear).
- **Web UI:** The ⚙️ Settings panel provides:
  - A single decibel-based slider for the noise gate (range -100 dB [Off] to 0 dB [Muted], default -50 dB).
  - A slider for gain (range 0.2x–3.0x, default 1.0x).
  - A slider for Latency Recovery (range 0 ms [Off] to 500 ms, default 150 ms).
  - Individual reset buttons (🔄) next to each value to restore their factory defaults.
- **API Endpoints:**
  - `GET /api/settings` — returns current `{ noise_gate, gain, latency_threshold }` as JSON (open; read-only).
  - `POST /api/settings` — updates one or more values (all fields optional). **Requires the session token** in the body (constant-time compared) or returns `401`. Incoming values are clamped to the shared bounds in `server/mod.rs` (`NOISE_GATE_*`, `GAIN_*`, `LATENCY_THRESHOLD_MAX_MS`) — the same linear ranges the `--gain` / `--latency-threshold` CLI flags are clamped to at startup (the `--noise-gate` flag is given in dB and converted to a linear value inside these bounds).
- **Storage:** Float values (noise_gate, gain) are stored as `Arc<AtomicU32>` (using `f32::to_bits()` / `f32::from_bits()`). Latency threshold is stored as `Arc<AtomicU32>` directly representing milliseconds.
- **Persistence & Auto-Sync:** The client (`localStorage`) is the **source of truth**. On page load it restores its saved settings to the UI and pushes them to the server on successful pairing, token renewal, or reconnection — so they survive a server restart. `loadSettings` only adopts the server's values on a true first run (nothing saved yet); when `localStorage` already has settings it does **not** fetch-and-overwrite them, otherwise a freshly restarted server (CLI defaults) would clobber the user's choices.

## 📱 QR Code Pairing

At startup, the server prints a QR code to the terminal containing the URL with the pairing PIN in the hash fragment:
```
https://192.168.1.42:8443#123456
```
- The PIN is in the URL **hash** (not a query parameter), so it is never sent to the server in HTTP requests.
- The client reads `location.hash`, auto-fills the PIN input, and initiates pairing automatically.
- The `qr2term` crate renders the QR code directly in the terminal.
- **IPv6:** server URLs bracket IPv6 literals per RFC 3986 (`https://[fe80::1]:8443#…`) via `url_host` on the server and a matching check in the client's WebTransport URL builder; the WebSocket fallback already gets this right through `location.host`. WebTransport binds dual-stack (`[::]`), and the self-signed cert registers the IP literal as an IP SAN, so a global/ULA IPv6 client works. `--ip` accepts either the bare or the bracketed form (`fe80::1` or `[fe80::1]`) via `parse_ip_arg`. Link-local addresses (with a `%zone` suffix) are **out of scope** — they don't round-trip through `IpAddr` or browser URLs.

---

## 🔁 Disconnect Detection & Auto-Reconnect

Disconnect handling is **transport-agnostic and does not inspect the close code.** This is a deliberate response to how iOS Safari behaves:

- On iOS Safari (the primary mobile target, using WebTransport), `transport.closed` surfaces **seconds late** and carries no useful code — it resolved as `{clean: true, code: 0}` even back when the server still sent an explicit `1001`. Datagram `write()` errors are similarly delayed. So neither the transport close event nor its code is a reliable, timely signal there. (Earlier the client branched on `1000`/`1001`/`0` and string-matched error messages, and the server sent close frames; both were removed in favour of the HTTP signal below.)
- The reliable, fast signal is instead the **HTTP layer**: the client already polls `/api/stats` every second while streaming, and the server replies `503` while shutting down. A `503` (or an unreachable server) is treated as a definitive "server gone".

How it works now:
1. **Unified close handler:** Both `ws.onclose` and `transport.closed` (resolve *and* reject paths, any code) funnel into a single handler. It ignores events that are stale (from a transport already replaced) or self-initiated (user stopped, or a reconnect handover is in progress), then runs one fast liveness probe (`/api/info`).
2. **Probe decides intent:** probe fails / `503` → server is gone → return to the pairing screen. Probe succeeds → it was a transient drop → reconnect. A `401` from `/api/stats` is handled separately: the server is alive but our session was taken over, so we re-pair **in place** (no reload).
3. **Server-gone locks the pairing screen (reload required):** the self-signed certificate is **regenerated on every server start**, so a server that went away and came back has a *new* cert hash — the loaded page's pinned hash and already-accepted cert are stale, in-page re-pairing would silently fail on the cert mismatch, and the stale page cannot even probe for the server's return (the mismatch fails the fetch). So on a confirmed "server gone" the client **locks the PIN input and shows a Reload button** (`location.reload()`); a full reload is the only reliable way back. Each "server gone" verdict is confirmed first (a `503` is definitive; a network error or a single idle-check failure triggers one confirming `/api/info` probe), so a transient blip doesn't needlessly force a reload.
4. **Stats poll is the fast path on iOS:** a streaming `/api/stats` poll that returns `503` triggers an immediate return to pairing. This catches a shutdown within ~1s without waiting on the late transport event. In Eco Mode, the lighter ~3s liveness check plays the same role.
5. **Reconnect (transient drops):** the first attempt is immediate (0s), then exponential backoff (1s → 2s → 3s → 4s, max 5 attempts). Each attempt renews the session token via `/api/renew` first; the loop bails out early once a probe confirms the server is gone.
6. The AudioContext and Worklet stay alive during reconnection to minimize resume latency.

All of these paths are idempotent: the `isStreaming` / `isReconnecting` / `isConnecting` flags ensure a shutdown observed by several detectors at once still results in a single, clean transition.

## 🔇 Mute

- **Activation:** Long-press (500ms) on the mic button toggles mute (with support for 50ms vibration haptic feedback). An accidental connection closure guard ensures that releasing the button after a long-press does not toggle the stream off.
- **Behavior:** When muted, the client stops sending audio packets (the AudioWorklet continues running to keep the AudioContext alive). The ring buffer naturally underruns, producing silence.
- **UI:** The status badge shows "Muted" in yellow, the VU meter resets to 0%, the mic button and ring turn yellow with a matching glow, and the helper text updates to "Long press to unmute".

---

## 📊 Statistics & Monitoring

- **Client-side stats:** Packets sent, uptime, transport type, network RTT (Ping), and server buffer depth are displayed in real-time.
  - **RTT (Ping):** Calculated on-the-fly by measuring the client-side request round-trip time of the `/api/stats` polling request (reusing HTTP persistent keep-alive connections).
  - **Buffer Depth:** The server reports `buffer_ms` directly in `/api/stats`, computed from `buffer_level` and the active source sample rate (`buffer_level * 1000 / source_sample_rate`), so it is accurate for non-48 kHz sources. (The client previously derived this as `buffer_level / 48`, which only held at 48 kHz.)
- **Server-side stats:** `GET /api/stats` **requires the session token** in the `X-Session-Token` header (only the already-paired client polls it, so this keeps connection/buffer telemetry off open access) and returns:
  ```json
  {
    "packets_received": 12345,
    "packets_lost": 2,
    "loss_percent": 0.016,
    "buffer_level": 480,
    "buffer_ms": 10,
    "buffer_capacity": 24000,
    "connected": true,
    "audio_device_ok": true
  }
  ```
  The shutdown `503` still takes precedence over this token gate — the `reject_during_shutdown` middleware runs **before** the handler, so a shutting-down server answers `503` regardless of the token and the liveness/shutdown detection is unaffected (a `401` instead means the session was taken over while the server is still alive). `audio_device_ok` is `false` while the output device is lost and the supervisor is rebuilding (see the Output Supervisor).
- **Packet loss detection:** The WebTransport handler tracks loss with a reorder-tolerant sliding window (`LossTracker`): received sequence numbers fill a 64-packet (`REORDER_WINDOW`) received-bitmap, and a seq is only counted as lost once it is **evicted from the window unseen**. So Wi-Fi reordering (a higher seq arriving before a lower one) is absorbed instead of miscounted — the earlier forward-gap approach emitted a false `warn!` every time a reordered packet arrived late, which this design eliminates. Duplicates are ignored, u32 sequence wrap-around is handled via wrapping arithmetic, and an anomalous forward jump (> `MAX_FORWARD_GAP`) re-baselines the tracker rather than fabricating a huge count. Confirmed losses surface live via `/api/stats` (`packets_lost`) and through a **rate-limited** `warn!("Packet loss detected")` — at most once per second, aggregating that interval's losses — so the user can react to deteriorating Wi-Fi in real time without log spam or false positives. A per-session summary is also logged on disconnect. `LossTracker` has its own `#[cfg(test)]` unit tests (reordering, confirmed-after-window, duplicates, wrap-around).
- **Per-session counters:** `packets_received` and `packets_lost` are reset when a new connection is acquired (both transports), so `/api/stats` reflects the **current** stream rather than the whole process lifetime. The WebSocket fallback runs over reliable TCP, so it only counts received packets (never loss).
- `buffer_capacity` is reported directly from the ring buffer (`ring.capacity()`) rather than a hard-coded constant, so it stays in sync if the buffer size changes.
- The client polls `/api/stats` every second during streaming, updating the loss percentage, RTT, and buffer depth with zero additional server overhead. This same poll doubles as the **primary shutdown detector** (see Disconnect Detection): a `503` response returns the user to pairing immediately, which is why it is the fast path on iOS Safari.

## 🛡️ Brute-Force Protection

The `/api/pair` endpoint includes **per-IP** rate limiting:
- After **5 consecutive failed PIN attempts from the same client IP**, the endpoint returns `429 Too Many Requests` and locks out **that IP** for **30 seconds**. Keying by IP means one misbehaving host cannot lock everyone else out (an earlier version used a single global counter that did).
- State lives in a single `Arc<parking_lot::Mutex<PairingThrottle>>`, where `PairingThrottle` holds a `HashMap<IpAddr, ThrottleEntry>`. Each IP's failure count and lockout deadline are read and updated together (the whole `handle_pair` bookkeeping runs in one synchronous critical section — no guard held across an `.await`). The attempted PIN is never logged.
- The client IP comes from `ConnectInfo<SocketAddr>` (the HTTPS server is served with `into_make_service_with_connect_info`). A completed pair request requires a real TCP+TLS handshake, so the key cannot be spoofed to flood the map.
- Idle entries are **pruned** on every check: an entry is dropped once it is neither actively locked out nor seen within the `FAILURE_DECAY` window (60s), so the map stays bounded and a legitimate user's stray mistype decays away. Successful pairing clears that IP's entry. `PairingThrottle` has `#[cfg(test)]` unit tests (per-IP isolation, lockout, idle pruning).

## 🔔 Update Check

A best-effort, opt-out check for a newer GitHub release (`src/update_check.rs`):
- Runs once at startup on a background `tokio::spawn`, **never blocks startup**, and is **silent on any failure** (offline, DNS/TLS error, unknown repo, malformed response). It only ever reports a *strictly newer* version (`parse_version` tuple comparison against `CARGO_PKG_VERSION`), so it can't produce a false positive.
- Opt out with `--no-update-check` or `QUICMIC_NO_UPDATE_CHECK`.
- **No HTTP-client crate.** It reuses the existing TLS stack (`rustls` + the process-default `ring` provider + `tokio-rustls`, all already in the tree) and the OS trust store (`rustls-native-certs`) to validate GitHub's public cert, and hits the `releases/latest` **redirect** — reading only the `Location` header (no response body or JSON to parse). The repo is `REPO` in the module. `tokio-rustls` is pinned `default-features = false` (+`ring`) so it never drags `aws-lc-rs` back in.
- The result is surfaced two ways: a one-line `info!` in the terminal, and `update_available` / `latest_version` / `releases_url` on `/api/info`. The web UI turns that into a small **dismissible top banner** linking to the releases page; the dismissal is remembered per version in `localStorage`. The browser never contacts GitHub (the server does), so the strict CSP (`connect-src 'self'`) is unchanged — an external `<a href>` navigation is not subject to CSP.

## 📂 Hybrid Static File Serving

The server implements a hybrid asset-serving strategy to allow easy customization without sacrificing standalone portability:
1. **Embedded Assets (`rust-embed`):** During compilation, all files in the `web/` directory are embedded directly into the binary.
2. **Local Disk Overrides:** The custom fallback handler checks if a requested file exists under a local `web/` directory, in precedence order: **(1) next to the executable** (the documented customization location), then **(2) the current working directory** (a fallback that also covers `cargo run`, where the binary lives under `target/`). Only the directory *paths* are cached (`override_dirs`, via `OnceLock` — the executable's location is fixed for the process); file existence and contents are re-checked on **every request**, so a `web/` directory or file added/edited while the server is running is served **immediately, with no restart**.
   - If found on disk, the local file is read and served (allowing users to customize the HTML/CSS/JS without recompiling the executable).
   - If not found on disk, the server falls back to serving the embedded file from binary memory.
   - **Path-traversal guard (`is_safe_asset_path`):** the request path is validated before any filesystem access — any path containing a `..`/parent or absolute component is rejected with `404`, so a raw client cannot escape `web/` (e.g. `GET /../Cargo.toml`). Browsers normalise `..` away, but a hand-crafted request would not, so this guard is required.
3. **MIME Guessing (`mime-guess`):** Correct `Content-Type` headers are dynamically resolved for both local and embedded files.
4. **Cache Validation (`ETag` + `Cache-Control: no-cache`):** Every asset is served with an `ETag` and `no-cache`, so the browser revalidates on each load (`If-None-Match` → `304 Not Modified` when unchanged) and picks up a rebuilt/edited asset — HTML, favicon, JS — **immediately** instead of serving a stale copy. The ETag source differs by origin: **disk** overrides use a **content-derived** hash recomputed per request, so even a same-length edit is reliably detected for live editing; **embedded** assets use rust-embed's **compile-time SHA-256**, so there is no per-request hashing and the body is never materialized on a `304`. Previously no cache/validation headers were sent at all, so browsers (especially iOS Safari, for the HTML and favicons) cached assets heuristically and never learned they had changed.
5. **Security & cache headers:** Every served document carries a strict **Content-Security-Policy** (`default-src 'self'`; `img-src 'self' data:` for the inline favicon; `frame-ancestors 'none'`), plus `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, and `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`. `style-src` is plain `'self'` with **no** `'unsafe-inline'`: all styling lives in `style.css` (there are no inline `<style>` blocks or `style="..."` attributes), and the JS-driven styling — e.g. the VU bar width — goes through the CSSOM (`element.style`), which CSP does not gate — the app is fully self-contained, so anything cross-origin is blocked. (If you ever load an external resource, or the WebTransport/WebSocket streams break on iOS Safari, widen `connect-src`/the relevant directive.) Separately, a router-wide middleware (`apply_no_store`) adds `Cache-Control: no-store` to any response that did **not** set its own caching policy, so dynamic API / `/ca` responses are never heuristically cached — the static assets keep their `no-cache` + ETag revalidation untouched (the same heuristic-caching lesson as item 4, applied to the dynamic responses the liveness/shutdown detection depends on).

## 🏗️ Shared State Architecture

State is split into two layers to keep the transport layer decoupled from HTTP concerns:

```rust
StreamState {          // Shared between WebTransport + WebSocket + API
    ring,              // Arc<RingBuffer>
    is_connected,      // Arc<AtomicBool>
    session_token,     // Arc<parking_lot::Mutex<Option<String>>>
    noise_gate,        // Arc<AtomicU32> (f32 bits)
    gain,              // Arc<AtomicU32> (f32 bits)
    latency_threshold, // Arc<AtomicU32> (milliseconds)
    packets_received,  // Arc<AtomicU64>
    packets_lost,      // Arc<AtomicU64>
    source_sample_rate,// Arc<AtomicU32>
    cancel_tx,         // tokio::sync::broadcast::Sender<()> (F5 handover + shutdown)
    is_shutdown,       // Arc<AtomicBool> (makes the HTTP API reply 503 while shutting down)
    device_ok,         // Arc<AtomicBool> (cleared while the output device is lost / rebuilding)
}

AppState {             // HTTP-layer only (extends StreamState)
    stream: StreamState,
    tls_identity,
    pairing_pin,
    wt_port, lan_ip,
    pairing_throttle,  // Arc<Mutex<PairingThrottle>> (per-IP failed-attempt count + lockout deadline, auto-pruned)
}
```

- `parking_lot::Mutex` is used instead of `std::sync::Mutex` to avoid mutex poisoning panics and provide faster lock acquisition.
- All hot-path state (noise_gate, gain, stats counters) uses lock-free atomics.

## ⚠️ Notes for Future Agents

1. **Compilation Environment (w64devkit / gnu).** The local toolchain is `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu` (w64devkit-style, not MSVC). Recent w64devkit builds (GCC 16.x) merge the unwinder into `libgcc.a` and no longer ship a separate `libgcc_eh.a`, yet Rust's `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu` target still passes `-lgcc_eh` to the linker — so a stock `cargo build` fails with `cannot find -lgcc_eh`. The fix is **local to the toolchain and intentionally not committed**: drop an *empty* `libgcc_eh.a` archive into one of the toolchain's own linker search directories (alongside the real `libgcc.a`; run `gcc -print-libgcc-file-name` to locate it). An empty archive — the 8-byte `!<arch>\n` header, e.g. `ar rcs "$(dirname "$(gcc -print-libgcc-file-name)")/libgcc_eh.a"` — is sufficient, because the actual unwinder symbols already resolve from `libgcc.a`; the stub exists only to satisfy the `-lgcc_eh` lookup and has **zero effect on the produced binary** (an empty archive cannot mask a genuinely missing symbol — the final link would still fail with `undefined reference`). Because the fix lives in the toolchain, the repository carries no machine-specific linker paths: there is deliberately **no in-repo `lib/` stub and no `.cargo/config.toml` rustflags block**, so the MSVC (Windows CI + release), Linux, and macOS targets never see any of this. Background: <https://github.com/skeeto/w64devkit/issues/52>. The README's "Build from source" section has the contributor-facing version. **Crypto backend:** the whole tree is pinned to the **`ring`** provider — `rustls` is pulled with `default-features = false, features = ["ring", ...]` and `axum-server` with `tls-rustls-no-provider` (we install the ring provider ourselves in `run`). This deliberately keeps `aws-lc-rs`/`aws-lc-sys` (which need a C compiler + NASM) out of the dependency graph, which matters most for this gnu toolchain. Do **not** re-add a default-featured `rustls`/`axum-server` (`tls-rustls`) — it would silently pull aws-lc-sys back in and reintroduce the C/NASM build burden. The trade-off is no post-quantum key exchange, which `ring` does not implement and a LAN self-signed setup does not need.
2. **Comment Style:** All code comments and documentation inside source code files (`.rs`, `.js`, `.toml`) must be written in **English**.
3. **Mutex Across Await Points:** In Rust async code, never hold a `std::sync::MutexGuard` (or `parking_lot::MutexGuard`) across an `.await` boundary. It makes the returned Future `!Send` and causes Axum's `Handler` compiler errors (`E0277`). Always drop the guard or run lock-dependent operations inside independent blocks.
4. **RingBuffer Safety:** The SPSC ring buffer uses `UnsafeCell` with `Acquire`/`Release` ordering. Only one producer and one consumer are allowed. Adding a second producer or consumer will cause data races. The `unsafe impl Send + Sync` is only valid under the SPSC contract.
5. **Atomic f32 Pattern:** Noise gate and gain are stored as `AtomicU32` using `f32::to_bits()` / `f32::from_bits()`. This avoids the need for `AtomicF32` (which doesn't exist in std). Always use this pattern for lock-free float sharing.
6. **Fetch Timeout Guard:** All client HTTP fetch requests use the `fetchWithTimeout` helper with a default 1000ms timeout. This prevents connection attempts from remaining "pending" indefinitely when the server is offline or unreachable on LAN.
7. **Liveness Detection Cadences:** The client watches for a vanished server at three rates, all driven by the 1s `updateStats` interval (see Disconnect Detection): every second while streaming (full `/api/stats` poll), every ~3 seconds while paired-but-idle on the main screen (lightweight `/api/stats` health check), and every ~3 seconds while in Eco Mode (lightweight check behind the black overlay). Any of them returns the user to the pairing screen when the server is gone. Do **not** rely on the WebTransport/WebSocket close event for this on iOS Safari — it arrives seconds late.
8. **Audio Module (`src/audio/`):** The audio subsystem is split by concern — `ring_buffer.rs` (lock-free SPSC ring), `processor.rs` (packet decode into the ring via `decode_into_ring`; the noise gate and gain now live client-side), `output.rs` (device selection + resampler + cpal stream + the device-loss supervisor `spawn_output_supervisor`, which owns the `!Send` stream on its own thread and rebuilds it if the device drops), and `mod.rs` (re-exports + `MAX_SAMPLE_RATE`). Each file keeps its own `#[cfg(test)]` unit tests next to the code (the idiomatic Rust layout): ring buffer (push/pop, wrap-around, overflow, underrun), the PCM decoder, and the resampler (unity-ratio passthrough, downsampling at a non-unity ratio, prebuffering, channel duplication). The resampler tests are an exact-behaviour safety net — keep them green when touching `write_data`/`ResamplerState`. `cargo test` runs them; CI gates on `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`, and `cargo test`, so keep all three green. CI (`ci.yml`) **skips docs-only changes** via `paths-ignore` (markdown, `assets/`, issue templates, `.gitignore`) — a commit that also touches code still runs, and `web/` is intentionally not ignored (it's embedded). A `concurrency` group cancels superseded in-progress runs on the same ref.
9. **Server Module (`src/server/`):** All server-side networking lives here, split by concern — `state.rs` (`StreamState`, `AppState`, and the single-connection lifecycle: `acquire_connection_slot` + `ConnectionGuard`), `api.rs` (REST handlers + their request/response types), `websocket.rs` (the WebSocket fallback, which rides on the HTTP server), `webtransport.rs` (the WebTransport QUIC server — a *separate* server, not routed through Axum), `assets.rs` (hybrid static serving), and `mod.rs` (router, the 503-on-shutdown / same-origin / `no-store` middleware, HTTPS server, and re-exports). Both transports share `state.rs`. Only `StreamState`, `AppState`, `build_router`, `run_https_server`, and `run_webtransport_server` are re-exported (public); everything else is `pub(super)`/private to the module. **Auth surfaces:** `/api/pair` (PIN), then the session token on `/api/renew`, `/api/settings` POST, `/ws`, and `/api/stats` (`/api/stats` reads it from the `X-Session-Token` header; the others from the body/query), plus the WebTransport session path. A WebTransport session with an invalid/missing token is **explicitly rejected** (`session_request.forbidden()` → 403) and a slot-busy one with `too_many_requests()` → 429, tearing the connection down immediately instead of letting it linger to the QUIC idle timeout — there is intentionally **no per-IP accept rate-limiting** (the LAN trust model + QUIC address validation + the single-connection CAS are deemed sufficient).
10. **Startup Errors & the `run`/`main` Split:** `main` is a thin wrapper that calls `run()`; on any `Err` it prints the full error chain and, **if the app was launched by double-clicking** (`launched_by_double_click`, detected on Windows via `GetConsoleProcessList`), waits for Enter before exiting — so a freshly created console window doesn't vanish before the error can be read. Server startup failures (e.g. the HTTPS/WebTransport port already being in use) are propagated out of the `tokio::select!` as fatal errors rather than only logged, so they reach this handler. CLI inputs are validated/clamped early: `--pin` must be exactly 6 digits, `--noise-gate` is taken in dB (clamped to [-100, 0], -100 = Off) and converted to a linear amplitude, and `--gain` / `--latency-threshold` are clamped to the shared `server::*` bounds.
11. **Client-side Noise Gate (`web/worklet.js`):** The noise gate **and gain** run **client-side** on the audio thread (the AudioWorklet); the server applies no per-sample DSP (it just decodes packets into the ring via `decode_into_ring`). The worklet's gate (same per-sample² threshold, 250ms hold) and only `postMessage`s packets that pass it, so during silence the client sends **nothing** (the phone's Wi-Fi radio idles — a real battery/heat win) and the main thread isn't woken; a throttled `{ level }` message still drives the VU meter to zero. Crucially, the sequence number is **only incremented for sent packets**, so the server's `LossTracker` sees a contiguous stream and never reports false loss. The threshold is pushed to the worklet via a `{ type: 'gate', threshold }` port message on stream start and whenever the dB slider changes (`sendGateToWorklet`). The server keeps no gate at all; it just decodes packets into the ring. An **onset look-ahead** prepends the last gated packet on a closed→open edge so a word's soft attack isn't clipped (the prepended packet takes the next sequence number, keeping the stream contiguous). The main thread also signals the worklet on mute (`{ type: 'mute' }`) so it skips all processing while muted, and drives a `.voice` glow on the mic ring from the packet flow as a gate-activity indicator. The structured port protocol (`gate` / `gain` / `mute` / `frame+level` / `level`) is the extension point for any future audio-thread feature. Note: the worklet emits the **full wire frame** — a 4-byte header gap (`HEADER_BYTES`, kept 2-byte aligned for the PCM `Int16Array` view) followed by the Int16 PCM — and transfers it; the main thread only stamps the sequence number into the gap and sends the buffer as-is, so there is **no per-packet allocation or copy on the main thread** (the one unavoidable allocation is the worklet's frame buffer, which transfer detaches).
12. **Release pipeline (`cargo-dist`).** Multi-platform release builds are managed by **`dist`** (cargo-dist). `.github/workflows/release.yml` is **generated** — do **not** hand-edit it; change `dist-workspace.toml` and run `dist generate` (it will be clobbered otherwise). Config highlights: `installers = []` (we ship plain archives, no install scripts), `targets` covers **x86_64 + arm64 for all three OSes** (Linux, Windows, macOS) — each built natively (cargo-dist picks current runners: `macos-15-intel` for x86_64-apple-darwin, `ubuntu-22.04-arm` for arm64 Linux, and a `[dist.github-custom-runners]` override pins arm64 Windows to `windows-11-arm` so it builds natively instead of cross-compiling from Linux via xwin), so there's no dead-runner problem to chase, `[dist.dependencies.apt] libasound2-dev` provides cpal's ALSA headers on Linux, and releases trigger on **pushing a `vX.Y.Z` git tag** (plus a `pull_request` plan-only check; no `workflow_dispatch`). The third-party license file is wired as a `[[dist.extra-artifacts]]` that runs `cargo about generate` (so it's attached to every release). Releasing: bump `version` in `Cargo.toml`, commit/push, then push the matching tag (`git tag v0.2.0 && git push origin v0.2.0`) — the tag, not the Cargo.toml commit, is what fires the release. It uses the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN` (no PAT). The separate `ci.yml` still gates `fmt`/`clippy`/`test` on push/PR. `[profile.dist]` in `Cargo.toml` (added by `dist init`, `lto = "thin"`) is the release build profile cargo-dist uses.
