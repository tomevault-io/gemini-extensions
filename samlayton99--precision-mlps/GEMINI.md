## Research Question

Can we find a training/optimization strategy that learns QI-like solutions, closing the gap between explicit construction (~10^-15) and training (~10^-10)?

Three violations in trained networks explain the gap:
1. **Gamma scaling**: gamma stays O(1) instead of growing as O(N)
2. **Weight blowup**: outer weights diverge instead of staying O(1)
3. **Rank saturation**: features collapse instead of uniform utilization

## How to Succeed
1. Always get context of the research! The papers/theory guiding the experiments are in the /papers/ folder. The main paper is `papers/QIs_workshop.pdf` ("Constructing Machine-Precision Neural Networks with Quasi-Interpolants"). NOTE: Section 3 (the construction) is NOT yet updated in that PDF -- read `papers/Section_3_Rewrite.pdf` IN ADDITION to `papers/QIs_workshop.pdf`, for the current construction (do not just read the rewrite on its own, it is only a single section rewritten), and `papers/practical_implementation.tex` for the fp64/mpmath implementation details. We are trying to complete this paper by finding an optimization strategy.
2. Use the additional repo 'continuous-mlps' (next door neighbor to this repo in the file structure) as inspiration or a resource when you need it (it is a correct implementation of the paper), but not as something to just copy exactly.
3. read docs/future_experiments.md every time. This is our main design spec doc that I will be working with you through.
4. When implementing new machinery or experiments, always write and clearly communicate to me the tests that verify your implementation actually matches the research (e.g. show me the QI construction reaches machine eps precision after being first built, etc.)

## QI Construction: Critical Facts

The QI construction in `src/construction/qi_mpmath.py` has two precision regimes.
**Read `papers/practical_implementation.tex` before touching construction code.**

- **fp64 path** (default, `precision="fp64"`, lambda=0.30): ~10ms, L_inf ~ 1e-12.
  Limited by fp64 cancellation in the convolution (c_j reach |c_0|~338 with alternating signs).
- **mpmath path** (`precision="mpmath"`, lambda=0.25): ~55s cold, ~0.25s cached, L_inf ~ 3e-15 (machine eps).
  Required because fp64 Toeplitz solve is ill-conditioned at lambda=0.25.

**Cardinal coefficients `c_j` are target-independent and cached to disk** at
`results/qi_cache/`, keyed by `(lambda_star, Kc, N, precision, mp_dps)`.
Second call at same config completes in ~0.25s even for mpmath.

**Use mpmath for baseline experiments (expD01 geometry ladder, exp13 solution basins)**
where QI is a fixed reference point. **Use fp64 everywhere else**
(training runs, sweeps, initialization). Both paths produce valid fp64 coefficients.

**mpmath does NOT violate fp64 assumptions.** The construction is an offline
precomputation that produces fp64 coefficients. The model, training loop, and
evaluation all run in fp64. Analogy: `numpy.pi` is computed at high precision
once and stored as a fp64 constant.

**Parameter warnings:**
- `lambda_star=1.5` does NOT work (intrinsic aliasing too large).
- `Kc=12` does NOT work (cardinal coefficients don't decay that fast).
- Use `Kc=160` (matches continuous-mlps) and `halo=default_halo(N, lambda_star)`.

## Key Abstractions

**QIMlp** (`src/models/mlp.py`): Single-hidden-layer tanh MLP (`nn.Module`). Always `inner_layer -> tanh -> readout`. Exposes `features(x)` for the Phi matrix and accessors for gamma, centers, readout weights.

**QIResult** (`src/construction/qi_mpmath.py`): Immutable dataclass holding construction output. Pure data -- never references a model.

**MetricsCollector** (`src/training/metrics.py`): Logs a fixed set of metrics at every eval step: train/eval loss, L_inf, relative L2, gamma/lambda stats, outer weight norms, feature rank. Writes JSONL.

**ExperimentConfig** (`src/config/schema.py`): Top-level dataclass. Every field has a default. YAML files only override what they need.

## Conventions

- **PyTorch with fp64.** `torch.set_default_dtype(torch.float64)` in `src/__init__.py`.
- **Device selection.** CUDA -> MPS -> CPU. Set in `src/__init__.py` as `DEVICE`.
- **Single hidden layer only.** No depth experiments until 1-layer is understood.
- **Freezing via requires_grad.** `param.requires_grad_(False)` to freeze.
- **Construction uses numpy/mpmath, training uses PyTorch.** Readout solve uses numpy/scipy. Model forward passes and gradients use PyTorch.
- **Multi-stage training.** Adam -> LBFGS is the default. LBFGS uses PyTorch's built-in closure pattern.
- **Analysis is per-experiment.** No pre-built analysis module. Each experiment's `run.py` implements its own analysis using PyTorch directly.
- **Results format.** JSONL for metrics. Config YAML saved alongside.
- **Experiment writeups.** Every experiment gets its OWN results file at `results/checkpoint_<X>_<name>/exp<X>NN_<name>/exp<X>NN_results.md` (e.g. `results/checkpoint_A_numerics/expA03_coeff_nullspace/expA03_results.md`) -- one per experiment, never a shared/per-experiment global doc (the only global doc is `results/results.md`). `results/` is gitignored EXCEPT `*_results.md`, `results/results.md`, and the one pinned notebook (see `.gitignore`), so writeups are version-controlled while data/figures are not.
  **Standard structure (every writeup, in this order):**
  1. **Title + Status** -- one line (approved / data-obvious / draft-pending-Sam).
  2. **TL;DR** -- 2-4 lean bullets, the takeaways; numbers only where they carry the point.
  3. **Question / hypothesis** -- get to the heart in 1-2 sentences; do not pad. Example (expA02): "Does solving the readout matrix directly beat the QI convolution, at both fp64 and mpmath?"
  4. **Experiment design** -- THE section that earns depth: a reader should come away knowing *exactly* what was tested. State the actual math (feature-matrix definitions like $\Phi_{ik}=\tanh(\gamma(x_i-c_k))$, the augmented $[\Phi,\mathbf 1]$, $\gamma=\lambda/h$; any estimator / interpolation / construction formulas), the key params (sweeps, widths, $K_c$, seeds), and the metric definitions ($L_\infty=\max_x|\hat f-f|$, rel $L_2=\|\hat f-f\|/\|f\|$). Use sub-bullets when there are several variants/checks. End with a single **Code & data** block -- the ONLY place file paths appear (run.py/config, data files, figures).
  5. **Results** -- the signal in plain language, sparse numbers. Then a **Figures** subsection with ONE bullet per figure (never one lumped paragraph): name the figure, give its layout (axes, what each line/color is), and what to look for.
  6. **Additional details** -- flexible; include only if it earns its place (derivations, confounds, caveats). Goes ABOVE Conclusions; omit the section entirely if there is nothing load-bearing.
  7. **Conclusions** -- synthesize the signed-off claim in 1-2 sentences; do NOT re-list the TL;DR.
  8. **Open questions** -- conservative (few); the global `results.md` re-aggregates them per checkpoint.

  **Voice / calibration:** aim for ~5/10 fluff -- plain language, actively cut redundancy (the biggest offender is the TL;DR restated in Conclusions). Keep the references and the per-figure how-to-reads; cut hedging and restatement. If a sentence is not adding information, delete it. The design section is the one place to add depth, not subtract it.
  **Number discipline:** spend raw numbers like currency -- only where they matter; do not saturate prose with `N=128, 1.2e-12, ...`. Use tables only when they tell a clean story.
  **Conclusions are special:** a statement may go in the Conclusions section ONLY if it is plainly obvious from the data, OR it was proposed, discussed, and explicitly approved by Sam. Do not write conclusions before Sam has reviewed the numbers and signed off; keep proposed-but-unapproved conclusions out (or clearly marked as pending). Write conservatively: state only what the data shows, and flag any metric that is not independent evidence.
- **Figure legends.** Every legend on a subplot goes OUTSIDE the chart, above it -- never inside the axes (it occludes data). Use a per-axes legend placed above the axes (e.g. `ax.legend(loc="lower center", bbox_to_anchor=(0.5, 1.02), ncol=..., borderaxespad=0)`) or a single shared figure legend across the top (`fig.legend(..., loc="upper center", bbox_to_anchor=(0.5, ...), ncol=...)` with `subplots_adjust`/`tight_layout(rect=...)` reserving the top margin). Applies to all multi-line subplots.
- **Research-summary formatting.** Write all math in research summaries/writeups in LaTeX (`$...$` inline, `$$...$$` display, KaTeX-safe -- no `\*`, no `\emph`). Do NOT hard-wrap prose: write each paragraph as a single line and let markdown/the editor wrap it. Manual line breaks mid-paragraph (short fixed-width lines) make the docs hard to read and edit.

## Experiment Workflow

Each experiment's `run.py` is a self-contained script that imports from `src/`:

```python
from src.config import load_config, expand_sweep
from src.data import build_dataset
from src.models import QIMlp
from src.construction import construct_qi, initialize_from_construction
from src.models.freeze import freeze_gamma, freeze_centers
from src.training import run_training

config = load_config("experiments/expC01_lambda_tradeoff/config.yaml")
for cfg in expand_sweep(config):
    for seed in cfg.seeds:
        for width in cfg.widths:
            dataset = build_dataset(cfg)
            model = QIMlp(cfg.model)
            # ... construct, freeze, train, analyze, save
```

## Dependencies

PyTorch, mpmath, numpy, scipy, PyYAML.

## Success Criterion

An optimization method has been found if, as widths N increase (e.g. {32, 64, 128, 256, ...}) on the target-family matrix (6 categories), over 3-5 seeds, it's error falls at O(log(1/eps)) and eventually reaches eval relative L2 <= 1e-13 and eval L_inf consistent with machine epsilon precision, without initialization from the exact constructive solution.
