Orientation for any agent working in `www-sacred`. Read this before touching code.

## What this repo is

`www-sacred` (npm package `srcl`) is an open-source React component library with terminal aesthetics. It is consumed in two ways:

1. **A Next.js 16 / React 19 site at `sacred.computer`** that renders every component in a kitchen sink at `app/page.tsx`.
2. **Simulacrum**, a zero-dependency CLI framework under `scripts/cli/lib/` (and a snake_case Python mirror under `scripts/python/sacred_cli/`) so the same layouts can render in a terminal.

The React side and the Simulacrum side share a single source of truth for the palette: `scripts/cli/colors.json`. The CSS surface drives the same colors via `--theme-*` custom properties in `global.css`.

## Repo map

- `app/` — Next.js App Router. `app/page.tsx` is the kitchen sink. `app/api/*` are tiny demo routes. `app/llm/[...path]/route.ts`, `app/llms.txt/route.ts`, and `app/llms-full.txt/route.ts` expose every `AGENTS.md` and `SKILL.md` as plain `text/markdown` URLs under `https://sacred.computer/llm/...` so external agents can fetch the sacred contract without `git clone`.
- `components/` — Sacred React components. `components/AGENTS.md` is the canonical catalog of every component (one entry per `.tsx`, with props, theming tokens, and CLI primitive equivalent) — read this first when picking a component, before grepping. `components/examples/` contains larger demo surfaces (AS400, MessagesInterface, CLITemplate, InvoiceTemplate, ResultsList, OneLineLoaders). `components/SimpleTable.tsx` is the fluid HTML table the CLI port examples use — its column/status contract maps one-to-one onto the CLI framework's `formatRow` + `cardHeaderRow` primitives. `components/Window.tsx` is the React peer of the CLI window primitive — wrap a CLI port surface in `<Window>` to render the same dialog frame the alt-screen CLI shows.
- `common/` — Constants and utilities shared across components.
- `modules/` — Stand-alone modules (snake game, chess, etc.).
- `scripts/cli/` — Simulacrum, the sacred CLI framework (CommonJS, zero dependencies). `lib/` is the framework, `lib/__tests__/` is the vitest suite (and the `dump_reference.js` fixture generator), `templates/` is the canonical TS template, `colors.json` is the shared palette.
- `scripts/python/` — Simulacrum's Python mirror. `sacred_cli/` is the package, `sacred_cli/__tests__/` is the unittest suite (and the parity test against the JS fixture), `templates/` is the canonical Python template.
- `scripts/test_python.js` — Node orchestrator for `npm run test:python`. Probes for `python3`, regenerates the JS fixture, then invokes `python3 -m unittest discover`. Skips with a warning if `python3` is missing.
- `skills/` — Four porting skills (TS CLI, Python CLI, React-to-React, hostile React host). Read `skills/*/SKILL.md` before porting.
- `.workdir/` — Read-only reference material from sibling projects. Never edit, never ship.

## Conventions

- All new comments use `//NOTE(@YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME): ...` (or `# NOTE(@YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME): ...` in Python). Comments explain _why_, not _what_. Delete self-documenting comments on sight.
- The CLI framework is intentionally zero-dependency CommonJS so TypeScript templates can `require` it via `tsx` with no build step. Do not add ESM imports inside `scripts/cli/lib/*`.
- The Python framework mirrors the JS framework one-to-one but uses snake_case. The same `colors.json` is the single source of truth — do not duplicate the palette. The two runtimes are locked into byte-identical output by the parity suite under `scripts/python/sacred_cli/__tests__/test_parity.py`. When you change a JS module, port the change to its Python mirror in the same PR — `npm test` will fail otherwise.
- React example components in `components/examples/*` should only depend on sacred's existing primitives (`Card`, `SimpleTable`, `Button`, `RowSpaceBetween`, etc.). The CLI port examples (`CLITemplate`, `InvoiceTemplate`, `ResultsList`) use `SimpleTable`, not `DataTable`, because `SimpleTable`'s column + status contract maps one-to-one onto `formatRow` and `cardHeaderRow`. Do not import from `scripts/cli/lib/*` from React — that code is Node-only and uses `process.stdout`.
- Tests live in `scripts/cli/lib/__tests__/*.test.mjs` (vitest, JS), `components/__tests__/*.test.mjs` (vitest, sync guard for the component catalog), `app/llm/__tests__/*.test.mjs` (vitest, sync guard for the `/llm/...` URL surface), and `scripts/python/sacred_cli/__tests__/test_*.py` (unittest, Python). The vitest suite uses `createRequire` so ESM tests can pull in CJS source modules. `npm test` runs both suites; `npm run test:js` and `npm run test:python` run them individually. Run `npm test` before opening a PR.
- Sacred CLI ports are static — no animation diffing system. The React side keeps its existing animation primitives (canvas snake, canvas platformer, etc.). The one exception is `OneLineLoaders.tsx` because the spinners are the entire point of that component.

## Scripts

```sh
npm install             # install deps
npm run dev             # Next.js dev server on http://localhost:10000
npm test                # JS vitest suite + Python unittest + parity suite (chained)
npm run test:js         # only the JS vitest suite
npm run test:python     # only the Python suite (skips with a warning if python3 missing)

## Where to start when porting

- **React → CLI (TS):** read `skills/port-sacred-terminal-ui-to-typescript-cli/SKILL.md` and `scripts/cli/templates/template.ts`.
- **React → CLI (Python):** read `skills/port-sacred-terminal-ui-to-python/SKILL.md` and `scripts/python/templates/template.py`.
- **CLI → React (sacred host):** read `skills/port-sacred-terminal-ui-to-react-using-same-conventions/SKILL.md` and any of the `components/examples/CLITemplate.tsx` / `InvoiceTemplate.tsx` / `ResultsList.tsx` files.
- **Sacred → foreign React app:** read `skills/port-sacred-terminal-ui-to-hostile-react-codebase/SKILL.md`.

## Keyboard and hotkey system

Sacred uses a vendored copy of [react-hotkeys-hook](https://github.com/JohannesKlauss/react-hotkeys-hook) at `modules/hotkeys/`. The module is self-contained CommonJS-compatible React code — no npm dependency. It provides `useHotkeys`, `HotkeysProvider`, `isHotkeyPressed`, and `useRecordHotkeys`.

### Architecture

- **`modules/hotkeys/parse-hotkeys.ts`** — parses key strings (`ctrl+a`, `ArrowDown`, `esc`) into a `Hotkey` descriptor with modifier flags (`alt`, `ctrl`, `meta`, `shift`, `mod`) and non-modifier key names. `mod` is a platform-aware shortcut: meta on macOS, ctrl elsewhere.
- **`modules/hotkeys/validators.ts`** — matching logic: `isHotkeyMatchingKeyboardEvent` compares a live `KeyboardEvent` against a parsed `Hotkey`, respecting modifier state. Guards (`isHotkeyEnabledOnTag`, `isKeyboardEventTriggeredByInput`) suppress hotkeys when focus is inside form elements unless explicitly opted in.
- **`modules/hotkeys/use-hotkeys.ts`** — the main hook. Attaches `keydown`/`keyup` listeners to either a ref'd DOM node or `document`. Supports `scopes` for conditional activation, `enableOnFormTags` / `enableOnContentEditable` overrides, `preventDefault`, and `keyup`-only mode.
- **`modules/hotkeys/hotkeys-provider.tsx`** — React context for scope management (`enableScope`, `disableScope`, `toggleScope`) and a registry of all bound hotkeys via `BoundHotkeysProxyProvider`. `HotkeysProvider` is mounted at the app root in `components/Providers.tsx`, activating scope-based hotkey gating for the entire tree.
- **`modules/hotkeys/is-hotkey-pressed.ts`** — global `Set<string>` tracking all currently held keys via document-level `keydown`/`keyup` listeners. Used by `useHotkeys` for multi-key combination matching. Handles the macOS meta-key quirk (clears non-modifier keys when meta is released).
- **`modules/hotkeys/use-record-hotkeys.ts`** — records key combinations pressed by the user into a `Set<string>`, useful for UI that lets users define their own shortcuts.
- **`modules/hotkeys/use-deep-equal-memo.ts`** — memoization helper using `Utilities.deepEqual` to prevent unnecessary re-renders when options objects are structurally equal.

### Where hotkeys are registered

| Component | Hotkeys | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `components/page/DefaultActionBar.tsx` | `ArrowDown`, `ArrowUp`, `ArrowRight`, `ArrowLeft`, `Enter`, `Space`, `ctrl+g`, `Escape` | Global focus navigation across all focusable elements + debug grid toggle + dismiss topmost modal |
| `components/DropdownMenuTrigger.tsx` | Configurable via `hotkey` prop (e.g. `ctrl+o`, `ctrl+a`, `ctrl+t`) | Opens/closes a dropdown menu |
| `components/DropdownMenu.tsx` | `Escape` | Closes the active dropdown (fallback for when focus is outside the menu container) |
| `components/modals/ModalError.tsx` | `enter` | Closes the error modal |
| `components/modals/ModalChess.tsx` | `enter` | Closes the chess modal |

### Where keyboard events are handled directly (onKeyDown / addEventListener)

| Component | Keys | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `components/DropdownMenu.tsx` | `ArrowDown`, `ArrowUp`, `Enter`, `Space`, `Escape` | Menu item navigation with focus wrapping, activation, and dismiss |
| `components/DataTable.tsx` | `Enter`, arrow keys | Cell navigation and activation within the gradient table |
| `components/ListItem.tsx` | `Enter`, arrow keys | Item activation and sequential focus traversal |
| `components/Select.tsx` | `Enter`, `Space`, `Escape`, arrow keys | Open/close listbox, navigate and select options, dismiss |
| `components/Input.tsx` | Native `onKeyDown` passthrough | Delegates to consumer callback |
| `components/TextArea.tsx` | Native `onKeyDown` passthrough | Delegates to consumer callback |
| `components/Checkbox.tsx` | Native `onKeyDown` via `<input>` | Standard checkbox toggling |
| `components/RadioButton.tsx` | Native `onKeyDown` via `<input>` | Standard radio selection |
| `components/ActionButton.tsx` | `Enter`, `Space` (inline) | Click activation for keyboard users |
| `components/ActionListItem.tsx` | `Enter`, `Space` (inline) | Click activation for keyboard users |
| `components/Accordion.tsx` | `Enter`, `Space` (inline) | Toggle open/close for keyboard users |
| `components/TreeView.tsx` | `Enter`, `Space` (inline) | Toggle expand/collapse for keyboard users |
| `components/CanvasPlatformer.tsx` | Arrow keys, `Space` (window listener) | Player movement and jumping |
| `components/CanvasSnake.tsx` | Arrow keys (window listener) | Snake direction control |
| `components/DOMSnake.tsx` | Arrow keys (window listener) | Snake direction control |

### Integration with the CLI framework

The CLI framework (`scripts/cli/lib/app.js`) has its own keyboard system based on Node.js `process.stdin` raw mode. It handles `q`, `Escape` (quit), arrow keys (pagination/selection), and `Enter` (selection confirm). This is completely separate from the React hotkey module — the two systems share concepts but no code.

## Working agreements

- Don't commit unless the user explicitly asks. Sacred ships releases manually.
- Don't add features the task didn't ask for. If you find a tangential bug, surface it instead of fixing it silently.
- Don't import from `.workdir/` at runtime. It is reference material only.
- Don't break the kitchen sink. After any component change, render `app/page.tsx` mentally (or in `npm run dev`) and confirm nothing regresses.
