# MAGELLAN — Multi-Agent Generative Exploration of Latent Links Across kNowledge

Autonomous AI experiment in cross-disciplinary scientific discovery. Tests
whether a multi-agent system with frontier models (March 2026) can find real
connections between existing bodies of knowledge that humans haven't
linked yet — with zero human input on what to explore.

## Platform: Claude Code

MAGELLAN is a Claude Code application. The entire pipeline — agents, commands,
skills, hooks, MCP servers — runs within Claude Code's infrastructure.

- **Dispatch model**: `/discover` loads `.claude/agents/discovery-orchestrator.md`
  into the top-level session and the top-level Claude acts as the orchestrator,
  dispatching the 14 pipeline sub-agents via `Agent`. Sub-agents cannot spawn
  further sub-agents (Claude Code runtime constraint), so orchestration must
  run top-level. Sub-agents communicate exclusively via files in
  `results/{session-id}/`.
- **Quality enforcement**: SubagentStop hooks (`scripts/*-stop-gate.py`) validate
  each sub-agent's output. A Stop hook (`scripts/orchestrator-stop-gate.py`)
  BLOCKS session termination when required sub-agent dispatches are missing
  from `state/dispatch-log.json` (critical set: `generator`, `critic`,
  `quality-gate`). Hook schema: `exit 2` = block, `exit 0` = approve.
- **Optional env**: `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` is set in
  `.claude/settings.json`. Not required for `/discover` (MAGELLAN uses classic
  sub-agent dispatch, not agent teams). Retained for unrelated workflows in
  this repository.
- **Config locations**: agents in `.claude/agents/`, commands in `.claude/commands/`,
  skills in `.claude/skills/`, hooks + permissions in `.claude/settings.json`,
  MCP servers in `.mcp.json`.

## How to Run

### Primary mode (fully autonomous — this is the point)
```
/discover
```
The Scout autonomously decides WHERE to look. The full pipeline runs.
You come back to find hypothesis cards in `results/{session-id}/`.
**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT run `/discover` in plan mode. The pipeline auto-exits plan mode if active.

### Alternative modes (for testing/debugging)
```
/discover circadian biology × tumor immune evasion
/discover solve: antibiotic resistance
/discover quantum coherence in biology
```

### Launch mode
```
claude --enable-auto-mode
```

### Publishing results
Results are automatically uploaded to https://magellan-discover.ai via API
at the end of each session (requires `/connect <key>` — see README).
The upload script (`scripts/upload-session.mjs`) is run by the orchestrator
and reads `ingest.json` from the results directory.

## Architecture

Fifteen agents. Orchestrator dispatches to all — never executes phases inline.

| Agent | Model | Effort | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Scout** | Opus | max | Finds WHERE to look: 10 strategies (incl. structural isomorphism + serendipity), bridge concepts, strategy diversification, exploration slot, rotating creativity constraint, TARGET QUALITY CHECK reflection |
| **Target Evaluator** | Opus | max | Adversarial challenge of Scout targets on 4 axes (popularity bias, vagueness, structural impossibility, local-optima) |
| **Literature Scout** | Sonnet | high | MCP-first retrieval (Semantic Scholar, PubMed), WebSearch fallback, full-text papers, disjointness verification |
| **Computational Validator** | Sonnet | high | Programmatic bridge verification: KEGG, STRING, PubMed co-occurrence, back-of-envelope physics |
| **Generator** | Opus | max | Hypotheses from parametric knowledge + literature + computational validation. Bisociation + multi-level abstraction. SELF-CRITIQUE with claim-level verification |
| **Critic** | Opus | max | 9 adversarial attack vectors including claim-level fact verification. META-CRITIQUE reflection. Writes critic_questions |
| **Ranker** | Sonnet | high | 6-dimension weighted scoring, per-hypothesis table, diversity check, Elo tournament sanity check, cross-domain creativity bonus (+0.5 for 2+ discipline boundaries) |
| **Evolver** | Sonnet | high | Genetic operations with diversity constraint. EVOLUTION QUALITY CHECK reflection. Conditionally skippable |
| **Quality Gate** | Opus | max | 10-point rubric + web novelty + per-claim grounding verification. META-VALIDATION reflection |
| **Session Analyst** | Sonnet | high | Post-pipeline meta-learning: strategy performance, kill patterns, bridge type analysis, creativity metrics (disciplinary distance, abstraction level, novelty type) → knowledge/meta-insights.md |
| **Cross-Model Validator** | Sonnet | high | Calls GPT-5.5 Pro (background submit + poll, reasoning xhigh, web search + code interpreter + shell) + Gemini Deep Research Max (Interactions API agent: google_search + url_context + code_execution, autonomous ~80-160 searches) for independent hypothesis validation. Generates consensus report |
| **Convergence Scanner** | Sonnet | high | Post-QG: searches ClinicalTrials.gov, NIH Reporter, patents for independent convergence signals. Finds partial mechanism confirmations from sources not consulted by pipeline |
| **Dataset Evidence Miner** | Sonnet | high | Post-QG: queries bioinformatics databases (HPA, GWAS Catalog, ChEMBL, UniProt, PDB) to verify specific molecular claims in passing hypotheses. Suggests computational follow-up queries |
| **Holdout Evaluator** | Opus | max | Validation framework: compares MAGELLAN output against known post-cutoff discoveries. Contamination check + mechanism similarity scoring |
| **Orchestrator** | Opus | max | Pure dispatcher: guard logic, adaptive cycles, session health, meta-learning metrics, disjointness hard constraint, rotating creativity constraint. No WebSearch/WebFetch |

**Model selection principle**: Opus for deep cross-disciplinary reasoning (Scout, Target Evaluator, Generator, Critic, Quality Gate, Holdout Evaluator). Sonnet for structured, search-intensive tasks (Literature Scout, Computational Validator, Ranker, Evolver, Session Analyst, Cross-Model Validator, Convergence Scanner, Dataset Evidence Miner). Effort levels are pinned per agent (Opus: max, Sonnet: high) to guarantee quality regardless of the user's session-level effort setting.

**Model alias resolution**: Agent frontmatter uses `model: opus` and `model: sonnet` aliases. These resolve to the current-latest models at dispatch time (Opus 4.7 and Sonnet 4.6 as of April 2026). The pipeline has been empirically validated on Opus 4.7 via end-to-end session testing: full 14-agent dispatch preserved, tool usage abundant, PASS + CONDITIONAL_PASS outcomes. The behavioral shifts noted in the Opus 4.7 migration guide (fewer subagents spawned by default, fewer tool calls by default) do not materialize in this pipeline because the orchestrator has no WebSearch/WebFetch (cannot inline) and stop-gate hooks deterministically validate output completeness. See `docs/CHANGELOG.md` for per-version migration evidence.

## State Management

State is split into a **slim coordination index** and **per-session results directories**:
- `state/session.json` — Slim index (~3KB): phase, cycle, status, selected_target,
  health counters, progress. NEVER contains hypothesis content.
- `state/dispatch-log.json` — Tracks every agent dispatch with timestamps.
- `results/{session-id}/` — All session outputs live here: human-readable markdown
  (*.md) and structured phase data (*.json) side by side. Phase JSON files contain
  lightweight metadata (IDs, titles, scores, verdicts). Full hypothesis text lives
  in the markdown files.
- `results/{session-id}/ingest.json` — Self-contained manifest for website ingestion.
  Contains session metadata, pipeline stats, and contributor key. The website seed
  script reads this instead of parsing markdown or session.json.

**Principle**: session.json contains ONLY coordination state. All session data
(both markdown and JSON) lives in `results/{session-id}/`.
Agents receive data via dispatch prompts, never read state files directly.

**Data flow for final.json**: Quality-gate agent writes `quality-gate.json`
(authoritative verdicts + `summary.session_status`). Orchestrator CREATES `final.json`
by reading `quality-gate.json` from disk — never from conversational memory.
Context compression corrupts numerical values in long sessions.

### Orchestrator Support Files
The orchestrator delegates operational code and reference schemas to external files
(read on-demand to minimize startup context):
- `scripts/init-session.sh` — Session initialization (creates state/session.json + results dir)
- `scripts/upload-session.mjs` — Website upload (reads ingest.json, POSTs to API)
- `prompts/session-summary-format.md` — Session summary formatting per status type
- `prompts/ingest-schema.json` — Schema for the ingest manifest
- `prompts/knowledge-schema.json` — Schema for discovery-log entries

## Commands
- `/discover` — Full autonomous (Scout finds targets)
- `/discover [A] × [C]` — Targeted discovery
- `/discover [topic]` — Open exploration
- `/discover solve: [problem]` — Problem-driven
- `/discover --context "text"` — Provide domain expertise as context for Scout/Generator
- `/discover --papers DOI1,DOI2` — Provide seed papers for Literature Scout
- `/discover --interactive` — Pause after Scout for target approval before proceeding
- `/connect <mgln_key>` — Link this CLI to your MAGELLAN web profile for discovery attribution

## Contributor Connection

Link your CLI to your MAGELLAN web profile so discoveries are attributed to you:
1. Create an account at https://magellan-discover.ai/sign-in
2. Go to your profile and generate a contributor key
3. Run `/connect mgln_your_key` in the CLI
4. Key is saved in `.magellan/config.json` (gitignored)
5. All subsequent `/discover` sessions embed the key in results
6. When results are seeded to the website, sessions are auto-attributed to your profile

## Licensing

**Software:** Apache License 2.0 (see `LICENSE` and `NOTICE`).
**Discovery outputs:** Dual-track — CC0 1.0 for autonomous `/discover` (public domain),
CC-BY 4.0 for guided modes (`/discover A × B`, `--context`, `--papers`, `--interactive`).
See `DISCOVERY_LICENSE.md` for full details. License metadata is tracked in
`session.json` (`metadata.output_license`) and carried into `ingest.json` for the website.

## Quality Rules
Every hypothesis MUST have: specific mechanism, falsifiable prediction,
literature-verified novelty, counter-evidence, test protocol, calibrated
confidence, groundedness assessment.

## Key Design Principles

### Core paradigm
- **Parametric generation + retrieval validation** — LLM generates cross-domain
  connections from parametric knowledge; external sources validate. Neither
  parametric-only nor retrieval-only.
- **Creativity-first ideation** — The Scout's 10 strategies are elicitation
  mechanisms, not search tools. The most creative connections come from
  parametric reasoning (structural isomorphism, bisociation, serendipity),
  not from WebSearch. WebSearch validates; parametric knowledge creates.
- **Life sciences optimization** — Retrieval tools (PubMed, KEGG, STRING),
  scoring weights (60% on Testability + Groundedness + Mechanistic Specificity),
  and hypothesis format are structurally optimized for life sciences.
  Other domains are supported but scores reflect infrastructure asymmetry.
- **Impact-aware prioritization** — Impact enters as a parallel signal,
  never replacing quality scoring. Scout adds impact_potential per target;
  Target Evaluator scores it as a 5th informational axis (not in composite);
  Orchestrator uses it as tiebreaker within the DISJOINT pool; Ranker decomposes
  Impact (10%) into paradigm (5%) + translational (5%); Quality Gate annotates
  application pathways (informational, not pass/fail); Session Analyst tracks
  impact-quality correlation for meta-learning. Impact Potential Score (IPS)
  computed from Scout estimate (40%) + Convergence Scanner translational signals
  (60%), reported alongside QG composite and EES.

### Architecture
- **Mandatory agent dispatch** — Orchestrator has no WebSearch/WebFetch,
  maxTurns=200 (circuit breaker only). Sub-agents have no turn limit (stop hooks validate output quality). Cannot execute phases inline. Must dispatch to sub-agents.
- **GOAL/CONSTRAINTS/STRATEGIES prompt structure** — Agent prompts define
  the goal and hard constraints, with strategies as advisory. Better models
  find better reasoning paths; constraints maintain quality floor.
- **Session-agnostic agent prompts** — Files under `.claude/agents/` must not
  reference specific session IDs, cycle numbers, or ephemeral session-level
  findings. Agents run on any user's machine with their own sessions; a prompt
  that says "this is the S024 failure mode" is meaningless to an agent
  executing on a fresh install. When documenting a failure mode discovered in
  a specific session, describe the GENERIC pattern (e.g. "author-identifier
  pairing is a frequent parametric error: paper exists, authors exist, but
  the cited PMID belongs to a different paper on the same topic") rather than
  naming the session. Project history (session IDs, specific evidence, dated
  decisions) belongs in `docs/CHANGELOG.md`, `knowledge/meta-insights.md`,
  and `docs/methodology-v5.md`, NOT in agent prompt files.
- **Reflection loops** — SELF-CRITIQUE (Generator), META-CRITIQUE (Critic),
  TARGET QUALITY CHECK (Scout), META-VALIDATION (Quality Gate), RETRIEVAL
  QUALITY CHECK (Literature Scout), EVOLUTION QUALITY CHECK (Evolver).
- **Adaptive cycles** — Orchestrator can early-complete (cycle 1 top-3 >= 7.0),
  extend to cycle 3 (survival < 30%), or skip Evolver (cycle 2 top-3 >= 6.5).
- **Bidirectional feedback** — Critic writes critic_questions to state;
  Orchestrator forwards to Generator in cycle 2.

### Quality safeguards
- **Groundedness scoring** (20% weight) — prevents fluent hallucinations
  from scoring high. Always integer 1-10 in JSON.
- **Claim-level fact verification** — Generator SELF-CRITIQUE verifies each
  [GROUNDED] tag. Critic has a dedicated attack vector for per-claim web search.
  Quality Gate verifies every [GROUNDED] claim individually. Citation
  hallucination or fabricated protein property = automatic FAIL.
- **Diversity constraint** — Double-level: Ranker diversity check + Evolver
  diversity constraint. Prevents hypothesis convergence.
- **Elo tournament sanity check** — Ranker runs pairwise comparisons on top-6
  as diagnostic against the linear composite ranking.

### Meta-learning
- **Target evaluation** — Adversarial challenge of Scout targets before pipeline
  investment. Prevents wasted sessions on trendy, vague, or impossible targets.
- **Computational validation** — Programmatic bridge verification (KEGG, STRING,
  PubMed co-occurrence, physics checks) catches quantitatively impossible
  mechanisms before the Critic.
- **Session analysis** — Post-pipeline extraction of strategy performance, kill
  patterns, bridge type survival rates. Orchestrator persists to BOTH
  `knowledge/discovery-log.json` (structured) and `knowledge/meta-insights.md`
  (cumulative prose). Scout and Generator read both in future sessions.
- **Strategy diversification** — Scout must use at least 2 different strategies
  across 3 targets, with at least 1 not used in the last 2 sessions.
  At least 1 target must use a strategy with < 2 sessions of primary data
  (exploration slot) to prevent convergence on safe-but-boring strategies.
- **Rotating creativity constraint** — Orchestrator assigns a different
  creativity constraint per session (mod 5): cross-discipline bridge,
  mathematical bridge, temporal gap, tool transfer, unsolved problem.
- **Disjointness hard constraint** — If DISJOINT targets with score >= 5
  exist, orchestrator NEVER selects PARTIALLY_EXPLORED. Based on 9 sessions:
  DISJOINT 84% pass+cond rate vs PARTIALLY_EXPLORED 30%.
- **Cross-model validation** — After Quality Gate, surviving
  hypotheses are automatically sent to GPT-5.5 Pro (empirical validation with
  reasoning effort `xhigh`, web search + code interpreter + shell;
  background submit + 30s polling because gpt-5.5-pro does not support
  streaming) and Gemini Deep Research Max (agent
  `deep-research-max-preview-04-2026` on the Gemini Interactions API; autonomous
  research loop with google_search + url_context + code_execution, typically
  ~80-160 searches per task) via their APIs. GPT verifies novelty against current
  literature and checks arithmetic computationally. Gemini DR Max produces a
  fully cited structural analysis with literature review, formal mapping checks,
  and code-verified quantitative predictions. The consensus report synthesizes
  where models agree/diverge. Requires `OPENAI_API_KEY` and/or `GEMINI_API_KEY`
  (stored in `.env.local`; agents must source this file before checking);
  falls back to export file generation if keys are absent. Non-blocking.
  GPT response IDs are persisted to `${outputFile}.response-id` so the next
  run auto-resumes if the bash background task is killed; the 4-hour
  wall-clock cap never cancels the in-flight response, only stops local polling.
  Typical per-session cost: ~$4.80 Gemini-side (DR Max paid-tier) + variable
  GPT-side at $30/$180 per 1M tokens for gpt-5.5-pro (~6x the previous
  generation pricing). Typical phase runtime ~30-90 min (DR Max: 10-30 min typical, up to
  60 min; GPT-5.5 Pro: 30-90 min typical, 4h wall-clock cap; both run in parallel).
- **Empirical validation layer** — Two post-QG agents provide evidence
  from sources the pipeline never consults: Convergence Scanner searches
  ClinicalTrials.gov, NIH Reporter, and patents for independent convergence
  signals. Dataset Evidence Miner queries HPA, GWAS Catalog, ChEMBL, UniProt,
  PDB via `scripts/query-biodata.py` to verify specific molecular claims.
  Both are non-blocking. Produces Empirical Evidence Score (EES) alongside
  composite score (not replacing it). Distinction from Computational Validator:
  CV operates on bridge concepts pre-generation; DEM operates on specific
  hypothesis claims post-generation.
- **Holdout validation framework** — Separate from production pipeline.
  Tests MAGELLAN against known post-cutoff discoveries via `/validate-holdout`.
  Pipeline runs normally on `[Field A] × [Field C]`, then Holdout Evaluator
  checks: (1) contamination — did the pipeline find the answer paper?
  (2) mechanism similarity — how close did MAGELLAN get? Verdicts:
  GENUINE_REDISCOVERY, PARTIAL_REDISCOVERY, ADJACENT_DISCOVERY, CONTAMINATED,
  MISSED. Curated holdouts in `validation/holdout-discoveries.json`.

### Post-pipeline verification
- **Computational verification** -- Post-hoc verification of hypotheses via
  Python scripts on published datasets. Each verification lives in
  `verification/{slug}/` with `manifest.json`, analysis script, and `results/`.
- **Manifest required** -- `manifest.json` links the verification to the website
  DB. Required: `slug`, `session_id`, `hypothesis_title_match`, `title`,
  `verdict` (CONFIRMED/PARTIALLY_CONFIRMED/INCONCLUSIVE/INTERMEDIATE/REFUTED),
  `verdict_detail`, `verified_at`, `report_file`, `figures` (array with
  `{key, file, caption, featured?}`). Mark 1-2 figures `"featured": true`
  for the hypothesis page preview.
- **Website sync** -- `npm run sync:verifications` in magellan-web/ reads
  manifests, uploads figures to Vercel Blob, upserts DB records. Pages:
  `/verifications` (index), `/verifications/[slug]` (full report).

### Operational
- **Session-scoped results** -- Each session writes to `results/{session-id}/`.
- **Plan mode auto-exit** — `/discover` automatically exits plan mode.
- **Hook schema** — All hooks use correct Claude Code schema (`"approve"/"block"`,
  stdin for PostToolUse, `"verdict"` field for kill detection).
- **MCP-first retrieval** — Semantic Scholar + PubMed MCP tools mandatory before WebSearch.
- **Unified results directory** — session.json is a ~3KB coordination index.
  Per-phase JSON data and markdown outputs colocate in `results/{session-id}/`.
  Prevents state bloat and reduces context consumption by agents.
- **Post-QG-then-summary ordering** — Session summary and ingest.json are written
  AFTER all post-QG agents complete (cross-model, convergence, DEM). This ensures
  summaries include EES, IPS, cross-model highlights, and convergence signals.
  final-hypotheses.md is written before post-QG agents (it doesn't need their data).
- **Deliverables verification gate** — Before writing session summary, the orchestrator
  runs a file-existence check on all required JSON + markdown artifact pairs. If a
  markdown report is missing, the orchestrator re-dispatches the original agent to
  write it (markdown is the primary deliverable, JSON is thin routing metadata).
  `phase: "complete"` cannot be set until verification passes.
- **Artifact verification in Guard Protocol** — After each agent dispatch, the
  orchestrator verifies both the phase JSON and corresponding markdown report exist.
  If markdown is missing, re-dispatches the agent. Catches agents that write
  structured data but skip the detailed human-readable output.
- **Cross-model completion enforcement** — If cross-model-validator returns
  `manual_export_only`, the orchestrator checks for actual validation files before
  marking the phase complete. Uses `cross_model_export_only` in phases_completed
  if validation files are absent (not `cross_model_validation`).
- **Post-QG Amendments** — After cross-model validation, the orchestrator appends
  an errata section to final-hypotheses.md with arithmetic corrections, citation
  fixes, and counter-evidence discovered by GPT/Gemini. Does not change QG scores.
- **final.json text enrichment** — The orchestrator extracts mechanism,
  supporting_evidence, and test_protocol text from final-hypotheses.md into
  final.json. The upload script requires these fields (>= 200, >= 50, >= 100 chars).
- **DEM follow-up suggestions** — The Dataset Evidence Miner appends
  "Suggested Computational Follow-Ups" with specific, actionable database queries
  a researcher could run to further validate hypotheses without wet-lab work.
- **Session concurrency safety** — `state/session.json` is a singleton shared across
  conversations. Three mechanisms prevent conflicts: (1) **Staleness check**: the stop
  hook considers sessions stale after 30 min without `metadata.last_updated` update,
  approving instead of blocking unrelated conversations. (2) **Per-session backup**:
  the orchestrator copies state to `results/{session-id}/session-state.json` on every
  phase transition; `init-session.sh` also preserves the previous session's state before
  overwriting. (3) **Resume support**: the orchestrator detects "resume session X" prompts,
  restores state from the per-session backup, and continues from the interrupted phase.
  `/status` shows interrupted sessions that can be resumed.

## Documentation Rules
When modifying the pipeline (agents, hooks, skills, commands), update:
- `CLAUDE.md` — Architecture table, design principles
- `README.md` — Architecture, phase list, project structure
- `docs/methodology-v5.md` — Full methodology with evidence
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md` — Version history with motivations and evidence
Keep all four aligned. Docs drift = architectural confusion.

**Where session-specific content belongs** (and does NOT belong):
- **Agent prompts** (`.claude/agents/*.md`): session-agnostic only. Describe
  failure modes and design rationale generically. No session IDs, no cycle
  numbers, no dated evidence. See "Session-agnostic agent prompts" above.
- **CHANGELOG** (`docs/CHANGELOG.md`): session IDs and specific evidence are
  encouraged — this is project history and helps readers understand why a
  change was made.
- **Meta-insights** (`knowledge/meta-insights.md`): per-session meta-learning,
  strategy performance, kill patterns. Session IDs are core content here.
- **Methodology** (`docs/methodology-v5.md`): references to sessions acceptable
  as evidence for design decisions, but the rules themselves must be general.
