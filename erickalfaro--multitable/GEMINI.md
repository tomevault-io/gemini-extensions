# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project

MultiTable is a local, browser-based dashboard for managing AI coding agents and dev processes. A Node.js daemon spawns PTYs via `node-pty`, persists state in SQLite, and serves a React UI over REST + WebSocket on `localhost:3000`. See `docs/OVERVIEW.md` and `docs/SPEC.md` for the product concept; this file is about working in the code.

## Monorepo layout

npm workspaces under `packages/*`:

- `packages/daemon` — Node.js + Express + `ws` + `node-pty` + `better-sqlite3`. The entire backend.
- `packages/web` — React + Vite + xterm.js + Zustand + TailwindCSS. Builds into `packages/daemon/dist/public` so the daemon serves the SPA.
- `packages/cli` — the `mt` CLI entrypoint (commander).

## Commands

Run from the repo root unless noted.

```bash
npm install                      # installs all workspaces
npm run dev                      # concurrently runs daemon (tsx watch) + web (vite dev)
npm run build                    # builds all workspaces
npm run lint                     # eslint packages/*/src --ext .ts,.tsx
npm run format                   # prettier --write packages/*/src
```

Per-workspace:

```bash
# daemon
npm run dev   -w @multitable/daemon    # tsx watch src/index.ts
npm run build -w @multitable/daemon    # tsc + copies src/db/schema.sql → dist/db/schema.sql
npm run start -w @multitable/daemon    # node dist/index.js

# web
npm run dev   -w @multitable/web       # Vite dev server, proxies /api and /ws to :3000
npm run build -w @multitable/web       # tsc + vite build → packages/daemon/dist/public

# cli
npm run build -w @multitable/cli
```

The daemon listens on `http://127.0.0.1:3000` and exposes `ws://127.0.0.1:3000/ws`. In dev, Vite proxies both to the daemon — start the daemon before (or alongside) the web dev server.

No test framework is configured yet — do not invent `npm test` incantations.

## Build gotcha: schema.sql

`tsc` does not copy non-TS assets. The daemon's `build` script already runs `cp src/db/schema.sql dist/db/schema.sql`, but if you ever invoke `tsc` directly (e.g. `npx tsc` inside `packages/daemon`), you must also copy the schema or the daemon will crash on startup when it tries to init the DB.

## Architecture

### Daemon (`packages/daemon/src`)

Startup sequence lives in `index.ts` and is load-bearing — read it before changing boot order:

1. Load global config (`config/loader.ts`, reads `~/.config/multitable/config.yml` via `env-paths`).
2. Check `pids.json` for orphaned processes from prior runs (`pids.ts`).
3. Init SQLite (`db/store.ts` — schema from `db/schema.sql`).
4. Create `PtyManager` and `PermissionManager`.
5. Install Claude Code hooks into each project's `.claude/settings.json` (`hooks/installer.ts`).
6. Build Express + WS server (`server.ts`).
7. Autostart sessions/commands from the DB; attach file watchers.
8. Listen on `host:port`.

Key modules:

- `pty/manager.ts` — the single source of truth for live processes. Holds an in-memory `ManagedProcess` map keyed by process id, handles spawn / restart / exit / auto-restart backoff, emits events (`state-changed`, `metrics`, `exit`, `resume-failed`) consumed by `server.ts`.
- `pty/ringBuffer.ts` — per-process scrollback buffer replayed to new WS subscribers.
- `pty/stream.ts` — the WS message router (`handleWsMessage`), translates `pty-input`, `subscribe`, `unsubscribe`, resize, etc. into manager calls.
- `db/store.ts` — better-sqlite3, synchronous. Exported functions are the DB API; routers call them directly rather than going through a service layer.
- `api/*.ts` — one router per resource (`projects`, `sessions`, `commands`, `terminals`, `processes`, `config`, `search`, `transcripts`, `notes`). Each is a factory that receives the `PtyManager` and returns an `express.Router`.
- `hooks/` — Claude Code integration. `installer.ts` writes hook entries into project `.claude/settings.json` so Claude Code calls back into `/api/hooks/*`. `receiver.ts` is the HTTP receiver. `permissionManager.ts` holds pending permission prompts until the UI resolves them; `costParser.ts`, `labeler.ts`, `optionDetector.ts`, `promptsParser.ts` parse hook payloads.
- `watcher/index.ts` — chokidar-based file watcher for `mt.yml` changes and per-process `fileWatchPatterns` restart triggers.
- `tracker/`, `git/`, `conflict/` — cost tracking, git diff via `simple-git`, and process-conflict detection.
- `types.ts` — shared types (`ManagedProcess`, `ProcessState`, `WsMessage`, `PermissionPrompt`, `Project`, `GlobalConfig`, `ProjectConfig`, `SpawnConfig`). Import types from here rather than redefining.

### API routing quirk

Creation endpoints `POST /api/projects/:id/{sessions,commands,terminals}` live on the **projects router**, not the resource routers. The projects router calls DB store functions directly. The per-resource routers (`/api/sessions`, `/api/commands`, `/api/terminals`) handle mutations on an existing id (`PUT`, `DELETE`, lifecycle actions). If you're adding a creation route, put it on the projects router to stay consistent.

### WebSocket

Single endpoint: `/ws`. Messages are JSON `{ type, processId?, payload }`. One client subscribes to at most one process at a time (`WsClientState.subscribedProcess`); `pty-output` is sent **only** to that subscriber from `pty/stream.ts`. State/metrics/exit/permission events are broadcast to all clients. **Do not also broadcast `pty-output` from `server.ts`** — there is an explicit comment warning against the double-delivery bug this caused before.

Heartbeat: 30s ping/pong, terminate on missed pong.

### Web (`packages/web/src`)

- `main.tsx` → `App.tsx` — single root. `App.tsx` wires WebSocket events to the Zustand store; re-fetches everything on `ws:reconnected`.
- `stores/appStore.ts` — the single Zustand store. Projects, processes (sessions/commands/terminals keyed by id), permissions, options, themes, modal state, selection.
- `lib/ws.ts`, `lib/api.ts` — WS client (with reconnect) and fetch wrapper. UI code talks to these, not `fetch` directly.
- `components/` — organized by area: `sidebar/`, `main-pane/` (Terminal / Dashboard / ProjectOverview / SessionDetailPanel), `modals/`, `command-palette/`, `permission/`, `option/`, `status-bar/`, `mobile/`, `ui/` (primitives).
- `hooks/useTheme.ts`, `lib/themes.ts` — theme system; CSS variables on `:root` drive colors. Inline styles throughout the codebase use `var(--...)` tokens.
- Styling: Tailwind is set up, but most components use inline `style={{ ... }}` with CSS variables. Follow the existing pattern in the file you're editing rather than mixing approaches.

### Session vs Command vs Terminal

Three process types, all managed by the same `PtyManager` but modeled separately in the DB and UI:

- **Session** — AI agent (Claude, Codex, etc.). Tracks `claudeSessionId`, cost, tokens, labels. If a session has a prior `claudeSessionId` on startup, the daemon **registers but does not auto-spawn** it — the user must pick Resume or Start New (see `index.ts` autostart block).
- **Command** — long-running dev process (dev server, worker). Has autorestart + file-watch-restart.
- **Terminal** — ad-hoc shell, no config.

Process state machine: `running` / `idle` / `stopped` / `errored`. Auto-restart respects `autorestartMax`, `autorestartDelayMs`, and resets count after `autorestartWindowSecs`.

## TypeScript / module system

- Root `tsconfig.json` uses `module: Node16` / `moduleResolution: Node16` — **relative imports in the daemon must include the `.js` extension** (e.g. `import { initDb } from './db/store.js'`), even though the source is `.ts`. Follow existing imports.
- The web package uses Vite's bundler resolution; no `.js` suffix needed there.
- Strict mode is on. `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` is a warning, not an error — but prefer real types.

## Prettier / ESLint

- Prettier: single quotes, trailing commas, semicolons, 100-char width, 2-space tabs.
- ESLint extends `eslint:recommended` + `@typescript-eslint/recommended`. Unused vars prefixed with `_` are allowed.
