# mcp-confluent

## Project Overview

MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that exposes Kafka-ecosystem and Confluent tooling to AI
assistants. The tool surface splits into two groups:

- **Kafka-protocol tools** that work against any Apache Kafka®-compatible cluster or Schema
  Registry (e.g., topic CRUD, producing and consuming messages, schema management).
- **Confluent Cloud-specific tools** that wrap CCloud REST APIs (e.g., Flink, Tableflow,
  billing), enabled only when the relevant service block (`confluent_cloud:`, `flink:`,
  `tableflow:`) is present in a connection's resolved config (from YAML or, during the
  migration, legacy env vars + CLI args).

Built with TypeScript, Node.js ≥22, and the `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`. Ships as an npm package
and a Docker image; supports stdio, Streamable HTTP, and (for backwards compatibility with older
MCP clients) the legacy HTTP+SSE transport.

These instructions exist to keep GitHub Copilot PR reviews focused on the invariants that matter in
this codebase. Author-facing guidance (how to scaffold a tool, run the inspector, etc.) lives in
`CONTRIBUTING.md` and `CLAUDE.md` — refer to those rather than repeating them here.

## Architecture (what reviewers need to know)

### Entry flow

At startup: `parseCliArgs()` → `initEnv()` → branch on whether `-c <path>` was supplied:
`loadConfigFromYaml(path, process.env)` for the YAML path, or `buildConfigFromEnvAndCli(env, ...)`
for the legacy env+CLI path. Both return a single `MCPServerConfiguration`. Then
`ServerRuntime.fromConfig()` constructs one `DirectClientManager` per connection → iterates
`ToolName` enum to build the enabled tool set → registers tools on `McpServer` → starts transports.

YAML (`-c <path>`) is the preferred path. The env-var-only path is legacy: parity remains for a
single connection in this release, but it's slated for a startup warning in a near-future release
and removal a release or two later. Don't approve new code that reaches back into the legacy
synthesizer or assumes env-only configuration as the canonical model. User-facing version of this
story: `CONFIGURATION.md` at the repo root.

**Tools are auto-enabled/disabled** at startup based on which service blocks are present in each
connection's resolved config (which can come from a YAML file or, for backwards compatibility
during the migration, from env vars + CLI args). Each handler declares its requirement via a
`predicate` property referencing a named export from
`src/confluent/tools/connection-predicates.ts`; `BaseToolHandler` derives
`enabledConnectionIds(runtime)` and `connectionVerdicts(runtime)` from it. An empty result
disables the tool. Both methods are `@final` — handlers must not override them.

### Key layers

- **`src/config/`** — Configuration core. `models.ts` defines `MCPServerConfiguration` (a Zod
  schema with per-service connection blocks: `kafka`, `flink`, `schema_registry`,
  `confluent_cloud`, `tableflow`, `telemetry`). `index.ts` exposes `loadConfigFromYaml()` for
  the `-c <path>` branch (parsing, `${VAR}` interpolation via `interpolation.ts`, and Zod
  validation). `env-config.ts` exports `buildConfigFromEnvAndCli()` for the legacy env-var + CLI
  path. Both return an `MCPServerConfiguration`.

- **`src/confluent/tools/`** — Tool system core:
  - `tool-name.ts` — `ToolName` enum; every tool has an entry here.
  - `base-tools.ts` — `BaseToolHandler` abstract class all handlers extend (directly or via a
    domain subclass like `FlinkToolHandler` or `TableflowToolHandler`).
  - `connection-predicates.ts` — predicate vocabulary handlers use to express enablement:
    `hasKafka`, `hasFlink`, `hasSchemaRegistry`, `hasConfluentCloud`, `hasTableflow`,
    `hasTelemetry`, `hasKafkaRestWithAuth`, and conjunctions like `hasCCloudCatalogSupport`.
    `connectionIdsWhere(connections, predicate)` is the canonical way to call them.
  - `tool-registry.ts` — `ToolHandlerRegistry.handlers` maps `ToolName` → handler instance.
    Wiring must be complete here for a tool to exist.
  - `handlers/<domain>/` — organized by service (e.g., `kafka/`, `schema/`, `flink/`); new
    handlers go under the matching domain or a new one if no fit exists. Some domains expose an
    intermediate base class (e.g., `flink-tool-handler.ts`, `tableflow-tool-handler.ts`) that
    implements `enabledConnectionIds()` once for the whole domain.

- **`src/confluent/client-manager.ts`** — public client-manager contracts (`ClientManager` and
  its constituent interfaces).
- **`src/confluent/base-client-manager.ts`** — abstract `BaseClientManager` owning every typed
  `openapi-fetch` REST client and the Schema Registry SDK client. No native Kafka broker.
- **`src/confluent/direct-client-manager.ts`** — concrete `DirectClientManager` adding api-key
  Kafka admin/producer/consumer via `@confluentinc/kafka-javascript`.

- **`src/confluent/openapi-schema.d.ts`** — generated from `openapi.json` via
  `npm run generate:openapi-types` (openapi-typescript). Never hand-edited.

- **`src/confluent/node-deps.ts`** — namespace-object wrapper around Node builtins, third-party
  constructors, and env access. ESM named imports are read-only from outside the defining
  module, so `vi.spyOn` can't intercept them directly; routing those dependencies through a
  namespace object lets tests spy on property access instead. All external I/O that isn't
  mediated by `openapi-fetch` or the Kafka clients must route through this module.

- **`src/mcp/transports/`** — stdio, HTTP (Streamable HTTP), and SSE transports built on Fastify.
  HTTP/SSE support API-key auth and DNS rebinding protection.

### Path aliases and module format

- ESM modules (`"type": "module"`). **Always use `.js` extensions in import paths**, even when
  importing `.ts` files.
- `@src/*` maps to `src/*` and `@tests/*` maps to `tests/*` (both resolved by `tsc-alias` at
  build time). Prefer the path aliases for internal imports. Relative paths are acceptable for
  root-level artifacts like `package.json`, or in other cases where the aliases don't apply.

## Code Review Guidelines (GitHub PR Reviews)

When reviewing pull requests for this project, focus on the checkpoints below. Let ESLint and
Prettier handle formatting — don't comment on style the tooling already enforces.

### 1. Tool registration is complete

A new tool requires edits in **exactly three places**. Missing any one of these means the tool
either doesn't exist or doesn't run:

1. `src/confluent/tools/tool-name.ts` — new `ToolName` enum entry.
2. A new handler file under `src/confluent/tools/handlers/<domain>/` — handler class extending
   `BaseToolHandler` and implementing its abstract methods.
3. `src/confluent/tools/tool-registry.ts` — import + entry in the `ToolHandlerRegistry.handlers`
   Map.

### 2. Handler declarations are correct

What a handler declares — via `getToolConfig()` and its metadata methods — shapes both correctness
and how the AI assistant uses the tool. Reviewers should verify each of these:

- **Tool annotations** (`READ_ONLY`, `CREATE_UPDATE`, `DESTRUCTIVE` from `base-tools.ts`) are
  client-side UX hints (used for things like confirmation prompts), **not** server-side
  enforcement. Pick the one that matches the tool's actual behavior, but don't treat `READ_ONLY`
  as a safety guarantee — the implementation still has to avoid mutations.
- **Input schema** should always be provided to `getToolConfig()`. For tools with parameters,
  use a Zod object schema's `.shape`. Every field must have a `.describe()` call; those
  descriptions surface as parameter docs to the AI client and are a review blocker if missing.
  For tools with no parameters, provide an empty object (`inputSchema: {}`), not omit the field.
- **`enabledConnectionIds(runtime)`** drives auto-enablement. A missing or incorrect
  implementation silently misconfigures the tool: it may register on a server that doesn't
  support it, or be disabled on one that does. Verify two things: (1) the predicate selected from
  `connection-predicates.ts` actually matches the service blocks the handler reads; (2) if a
  domain subclass exists (e.g., `FlinkToolHandler`, `TableflowToolHandler`), the handler extends
  it rather than reimplementing the same predicate. Multiple handlers in the same domain with
  the same predicate and no shared subclass are a candidate for extracting a domain base class.
- **New predicates** in `connection-predicates.ts` are rare. Before accepting one, verify no
  existing predicate (or conjunction) covers the case.

### 3. Type safety

- **No `any` types.** `noImplicitAny` is disabled in `tsconfig.json` (a workaround for OpenAPI type
  resolution), which means implicit `any` slips through type-check. Review explicitly for it.
- Prefer the `openapi-fetch` typed clients over raw `fetch`; the types in `openapi-schema.d.ts`
  are the source of truth for Confluent Cloud request/response shapes.
- Prefer `enum` over string union types for constants with semantic meaning (see `ToolName`).
- New public classes and exported functions get JSDoc.

### 4. Error handling

- Never silently swallow exceptions.
- Log via the pino logger in `src/logger.ts`, or rethrow after enrichment.
- Return errors through `this.createResponse(message, isError, _meta?)` on `BaseToolHandler`.
- `BaseToolHandler` and domain subclasses (e.g. `FlinkToolHandler`) expose protected convenience helpers for common parameter patterns (required vs. optional arg/config fallback, domain-specific ID resolution). Read those classes before writing inline fallback logic.
- Set `isError: true` on error results.
- Write actionable error messages: say what happened and, where useful, how to resolve it.
- Name the missing or invalid config in auth/configuration errors, so users don't have to read
  source to debug.

### 5. Stubbable boundaries

- External I/O (filesystem, process env, network not mediated by `openapi-fetch` or Kafka clients)
  should go through `src/confluent/node-deps.ts` so unit tests can spy on it via `vi.spyOn`. If a
  PR introduces a new direct node-module dependency, push back and ask for it to be routed through
  `node-deps.ts`.
- New configuration reads should go through the schema-validated config layer, not `process.env`
  or ad-hoc file reads.

### 6. Transport and auth changes

- Anything under `src/mcp/transports/` is security-sensitive. For the HTTP-based transports,
  verify all three DNS-rebinding and auth mitigations still apply to every endpoint: `Host`
  header allowlisting (via `MCP_ALLOWED_HOSTS`, enforced by `src/mcp/transports/auth.ts`),
  localhost-only binding in local dev, and authentication on all requests. The `--disable-auth`
  flag is for local dev only — guard the README/CONTRIBUTING wording if it's touched.
- Long-running resources (listeners, intervals, streams) added to transport code need explicit
  teardown in the `TransportManager` shutdown path.

### 7. Testing

- New behavior needs unit tests. Tests are co-located as `*.test.ts` next to the file under test
  and run with Vitest.
- Stub external interactions with `vi.spyOn` (preferred) or `vi.fn()`. `vitest.config.ts` sets
  `restoreMocks: true`, so every spy is auto-restored after each test, and no per-test
  `afterEach` restore hooks are needed. Shared stub helpers live in `tests/stubs/`; test data
  factories live in `tests/factories/`.
- ESM named imports are read-only from outside the defining module per the ECMAScript spec, so
  `vi.spyOn` can't intercept a `import { readFileSync } from "node:fs"` at a call site. The
  project's convention is to route such dependencies through `src/confluent/node-deps.ts` so
  callers access them via property lookup, and tests spy on those properties. Project-local
  helpers that compose around already-wrapped primitives don't need their own namespace object;
  tests stub the underlying primitive instead.
- **`vi.mock` is not used in this project, by design.** It's a different mechanism from
  `vi.spyOn` (module graph rewrite vs. runtime property mutation) and the tradeoffs go the
  wrong way for this codebase: file-scoped mock state instead of per-test granularity, reduced
  type safety on the real-module boundary, no equivalent for accessor-mode spies
  (`vi.spyOn(obj, "prop", "get")`), and hoisting surprises. Every dependency that currently
  needs stubbing can be handled by wrapping + `vi.spyOn`. Flag PRs that introduce `vi.mock`
  and ask for a namespace-object wrapping instead.
- Outer `describe()` per file, inner `describe()` per class/function, `it("should ...")` per
  behavior.

## Files to skip in reviews (auto-generated or artifact)

Do not comment on these for style, patterns, or best practices (build artifacts, `node_modules`,
coverage output, etc. are already excluded via `.gitignore` and won't appear in diffs):

- `src/confluent/openapi-schema.d.ts` — generated from `openapi.json` by
  `npm run generate:openapi-types`. The "OpenAPI Types" CI job re-runs the generator and fails on
  drift; trust it. Never hand-edit this file.
- `openapi.json` — a vendored snapshot of the public Confluent Cloud API spec, not this project's
  own contract. It's only edited when a handler needs a Confluent Cloud endpoint the snapshot
  doesn't yet cover. Don't nitpick its contents.

## Style preferences (avoid nitpicking)

- `import type { ... }` vs `import { ... }` — both are valid; TypeScript's `verbatimModuleSyntax`
  isn't enforced here. Don't request changes solely over this.
- Formatting and import ordering are owned by Prettier + `prettier-plugin-organize-imports`, which
  run in the Husky pre-commit hook. Don't comment on whitespace, quote style, or import order.
- Focus reviews on logic, architecture, testing, and the checkpoints above.
- We have competent CI/CD checks enforcing linting, TypeScript type-checks, and the test suite.
  When reviewing, do not bother flagging that a change "might fail the build"; if it does, CI
  will catch it and the author will fix it before merge.

## Review checklist

Before approving, confirm:

- [ ] New tools touch all three registration points (`ToolName` enum, handler file,
      `ToolHandlerRegistry.handlers`). `enabledConnectionIds()` uses the correct predicate from
      `connection-predicates.ts` (or inherits it from a domain subclass). All input schema fields
      have `.describe()` calls.
- [ ] No `any` types introduced; types come from `openapi-schema.d.ts` where applicable.
- [ ] Error paths surface actionable messages; exceptions are logged or rethrown, never swallowed.
- [ ] New external I/O is stubbable (routed through `node-deps.ts` or typed API clients).
- [ ] Transport/auth changes preserve existing protections and clean up resources on shutdown.
- [ ] New behavior has co-located Vitest tests (with stubbed externals if needed).
- [ ] If `openapi.json` was edited, `openapi-schema.d.ts` was regenerated (or the OpenAPI Types CI
      job is green).
- [ ] PR description and applicable checklist items in `.github/pull_request_template.md` are
      filled in; CHANGELOG is updated for user-visible changes.
