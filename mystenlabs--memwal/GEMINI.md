# Walrus Memory — Portable Agent Memory

Walrus Memory enables AI agents to operate reliably across apps and sessions, without losing context. It stores memories on Walrus (decentralized storage), encrypts them with SEAL, enforces ownership onchain via Sui smart contracts, and retrieves them with semantic (vector) search. Memory is portable by design — not tied to a single runtime or provider — and scoped by `owner + namespace` for isolation and coordination.

---

## When to Use

Use Walrus Memory when your app or agent needs:

- **Portable memory** — persists outside prompts and context windows, moves across agents, apps, and workflows
- **Full owner control** — programmable permissions and explicit ownership define how memory is shared and accessed
- **Agent coordination** — shared memory spaces help agents coordinate across long-running and multi-step workflows
- **Semantic recall** — retrieve memories by meaning, not just keywords
- **Verifiable integrity** — memory integrity can be independently verified without centralized trust
- **Cross-app memory** — not tied to a single runtime or provider, share memory between apps via delegate keys

---

## When NOT to Use

- Temporary conversation context that only matters in the current session
- Large file storage (Walrus Memory is optimized for text memories)
- Use cases that don't need encryption or decentralization

---

## Installation

```bash
# Install the SDK
pnpm add @mysten-incubation/memwal

# Optional: for Vercel AI SDK integration
pnpm add ai zod

# Optional: for manual client (client-side SEAL encryption)
pnpm add @mysten/sui @mysten/seal @mysten/walrus
```

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Get Your Credentials

You need a **delegate key** (Ed25519 private key) and **account ID** (Walrus Memory account object ID on Sui).

Generate them at:
- Production: https://memory.walrus.xyz
- Staging: https://staging.memory.walrus.xyz

### 2. Initialize the SDK

```ts
import { MemWal } from "@mysten-incubation/memwal";

const memwal = MemWal.create({
  key: process.env.MEMWAL_PRIVATE_KEY!,
  accountId: process.env.MEMWAL_ACCOUNT_ID!,
  serverUrl: process.env.MEMWAL_SERVER_URL ?? "https://relayer.memory.walrus.xyz",
  namespace: "my-app",
});
```

### 3. Store and Recall Memories

```ts
// Store one already-distilled fact and wait until it is indexed.
await memwal.rememberAndWait(
  "User prefers dark mode and works in TypeScript.",
  undefined,
  { timeoutMs: 30_000 },
);

// Recall by meaning
const result = await memwal.recall({ query: "What are the user's preferences?" });
console.log(result.results);

// Extract facts from free-form text and wait until all accepted facts are indexed.
const analyzed = await memwal.analyzeAndWait(
  "I live in Hanoi and prefer dark mode.",
  undefined,
  { timeoutMs: 30_000 },
);
console.log(analyzed.facts.map((fact) => fact.text));

// Check relayer health
await memwal.health();
```

Use `*AndWait` when a workshop UI saves and then immediately recalls in the
same flow. Indexing can lag by a few seconds, so `remember()` / `analyze()`
may return before recall can find the new memory. Manual polling is still
available for advanced async UIs:

```ts
const accepted = await memwal.remember("User likes Sui.");
const stored = await memwal.waitForRememberJob(accepted.job_id, {
  pollIntervalMs: 750,
  timeoutMs: 30_000,
});
```

### All Response Shapes

```ts
interface RememberAcceptedResult {
  job_id: string;
  status: string;
}

interface RememberJobStatus {
  job_id: string;
  status: "pending" | "running" | "uploaded" | "done" | "failed" | "not_found";
  owner?: string;
  namespace?: string;
  blob_id?: string;
  error?: string;
}

interface RememberResult {
  id: string;
  job_id?: string;
  blob_id: string;
  owner: string;
  namespace: string;
}

interface RecallMemory {
  blob_id: string;
  text: string;
  distance: number;
}

interface RecallResult {
  results: RecallMemory[];
  total: number;
}

interface RecallOptions {
  limit?: number;
  topK?: number;
  namespace?: string;
  maxDistance?: number;
}

interface RememberBulkAcceptedResult {
  job_ids: string[];
  total: number;
  status: string;
}

interface AnalyzedFact {
  text: string;
  id: string;
  job_id?: string;
  blob_id?: string;
}

interface AnalyzeResult {

}

interface RememberBulkStatusItem {
  job_id: string;
  status: "pending" | "running" | "uploaded" | "done" | "failed" | "not_found";
  blob_id?: string;
  error?: string;
}

interface RememberBulkStatusResult {
  results: RememberBulkStatusItem[];
}

interface RememberBulkItemResult {
  id: string;
  blob_id: string;
  status: "done" | "failed" | "timeout";
  namespace: string;
  error?: string;
}

interface RememberBulkResult {
  results: RememberBulkItemResult[];
  total: number;
  succeeded: number;
  failed: number;
}

interface AnalyzeWaitResult extends RememberBulkResult {
  facts: AnalyzedFact[];
  owner: string;
}

interface EmbedResult {
  vector: number[];
}

interface RestoreResult {
  restored: number;
  skipped: number;
  total: number;
  namespace: string;
  owner: string;
}

interface HealthResult {
  status: string;
  version: string;
  mode?: string;
  prompt_versions?: {
    extract: string;
    ask: string;
  };
  relayerVersion?: string;
  apiVersion?: string;
  minSupportedSdk?: {
    typescript: string;
    python: string;
    mcp: string;
  };
  featureFlags?: Record<string, boolean>;
  deprecations?: Array<{
    surface: string;
    deprecatedSince: string;
    removalApiVersion: string;
    guidance: string;
  }>;
  build?: {
    commit?: string;
    buildTimestamp?: string;
  };
}
```

`facts[].text` is the extracted fact text to render in UIs. `job_ids[]`
aligns with the accepted fact jobs; use `analyzeAndWait()` when the UI needs
those facts indexed before continuing.

### Namespace Semantics

A namespace is an **opaque, flat string label** scoped to a single owner. It is the unit of memory isolation: a recall in namespace `A` will never surface entries written to namespace `B`, even for the same owner, and never surfaces other owners' entries even in the same namespace.

#### Validation

The server accepts any non-empty string as a namespace. There is no length cap, no character whitelist, no normalization (whitespace, case, Unicode). Whatever you send is stored verbatim and matched with exact equality. If you omit the namespace, the server falls back to the literal string `"default"`.

> **Implication:** `"my-app"`, `" my-app"` (leading space), `"My-App"`, and `"my-app/"` are four distinct namespaces. Pick a convention and stick to it.

#### Flat, not hierarchical

Slashes and dots have **no special meaning**. `"chat/user-42"` is a single opaque label, not a path. The server uses `WHERE namespace = $1` exact-equality for every read; there is no prefix matching, no parent/child traversal, and no wildcard query. If you need hierarchy, build it in the application layer (e.g. recall across known namespaces and merge client-side).

#### Overwrite behavior — `remember()` is **always append, never upsert**

Every accepted `remember()` call creates a **new memory entry** with a freshly generated UUID. Sending the same text to the same `(owner, namespace)` twice will produce **two separate entries** that both surface in future recalls. The namespace is metadata for filtering, not a key for deduplication.

```ts
await memwal.remember("I prefer dark mode", "prefs");
await memwal.remember("I prefer dark mode", "prefs");
// recall("preferences", { namespace: "prefs" }) → 2 entries, both with the same text
```

If you need uniqueness, either dedupe before calling `remember()`, or delete the prior entry first.

#### Isolation guarantees

| Scenario | Visible to recall? |
|---|---|
| Same owner, same namespace | ✅ |
| Same owner, different namespace | ❌ |
| Different owner, same namespace | ❌ |
| Different owner, different namespace | ❌ |

Cross-namespace and cross-owner reads are not just filtered out of results — the server's SQL `WHERE` clause excludes them entirely, so they are never decrypted or transferred.

### Restore Semantics

`restore(namespace, limit?)` rebuilds **missing** local index entries for a namespace from Walrus. It is a recovery operation, not a sync — already-indexed blobs are left alone.

#### Response fields

| Field | Counts | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `restored` | Blobs the relayer just rebuilt this call | Pulled from Walrus → SEAL decrypted → re-embedded → inserted as a new row |
| `skipped` | On-chain blobs already in the local index | No work needed; relayer left them as-is |
| `total` | All on-chain blobs the relayer saw for `(owner, namespace)` | Before the limit was applied |
| `namespace` | Echo of the request | |
| `owner` | Resolved owner address | |

**Silent drops.** A blob that *cannot* be decrypted or embedded (e.g. wrong delegate key, malformed ciphertext, embedding API down) is dropped without counting in `restored` *or* `skipped`. `restored + skipped` is therefore a lower bound on healthy entries, not a strict equality with `total`.

#### Default and limit

* `limit` defaults to `10` in both TypeScript and Python SDKs and matches the server-side default. The Python SDK historically defaulted to `50`; it is now realigned with the server.
* `limit` caps the **inspected** blob set, newest-first. It does not cap `restored` independently — if all 10 inspected blobs are already indexed, `restored = 0` and `skipped = 10`.
* There is no enforced server-side maximum, but very large limits will dominate latency (see below).

#### Pagination

**Restore is single-shot — there is no cursor.** To rebuild a namespace larger than your chosen `limit`, call again with a larger `limit`, or delete local rows you want re-imported first. Pagination is on the roadmap; until it lands, treat `restore()` as a "top up to N most recent" operation.

#### Performance

Latency scales linearly in `limit`:

* Up to **10 concurrent** Walrus aggregator downloads
* Up to **3 concurrent** SEAL decrypts (CPU-bound, capped intentionally)
* Embedding requests in parallel (bounded by the relayer's embedding pool)

Expect **seconds per blob** on a cold cache. Use small limits (≤ 50) for interactive flows and run larger restores out-of-band.

### Recall Distance and Filtering

`recall()` returns the closest K memories by vector distance. There is no
default relevance threshold, so small namespaces may return weak filler results
because they are still the closest available matches.

Lower distance means more similar:

| Distance | Rough meaning |
|---|---|
| `< 0.25` | Duplicate or very close |
| `0.25 - 0.55` | Related |
| `0.55 - 0.7` | Weak/noisy |
| `>= 0.7` | Usually unrelated |

Use SDK-side filtering when you only want clearly relevant results:

```ts
const memories = await memwal.recall({
  query: "what did I eat yesterday?",
  limit: 10,
  namespace: "reading-tracker",
  maxDistance: 0.7,
});
```

Equivalent manual filtering:

```ts
const memories = await memwal.recall({
  query: "what did I eat yesterday?",
  limit: 10,
  namespace: "reading-tracker",
});
const relevant = memories.results.filter((memory) => memory.distance < 0.7);
```

## Configuration

### MemWalConfig

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `key` | `string` | Yes | — | Ed25519 delegate private key in hex |
| `accountId` | `string` | Yes | — | Walrus Memory account object ID on Sui |
| `serverUrl` | `string` | No | `https://relayer.memory.walrus.xyz` | Relayer URL |
| `namespace` | `string` | No | `"default"` | Default namespace for memory isolation |

### Managed Relayer Endpoints

| Network | Relayer URL |
|---|---|
| **Production** (mainnet) | `https://relayer.memory.walrus.xyz` |
| **Staging** (testnet) | `https://relayer-staging.memory.walrus.xyz` |

### Framework and Key Handling

Delegate private keys belong on the server only. In Next.js App Router, call
Walrus Memory from server actions, route handlers, or other server-only modules that
read `MEMWAL_PRIVATE_KEY` from server env.

`"use server"` files can only export async functions; keep constants, schemas,
and reusable client builders in a separate server-only module.

```ts
// app/actions/memory.ts
"use server";

import { getMemWal } from "@/lib/memwal";

export async function savePreference(text: string) {
  const memwal = getMemWal();
  return memwal.rememberAndWait(text, "my-app", { timeoutMs: 30_000 });
}
```

```ts
// lib/memwal.ts
import "server-only";
import { MemWal } from "@mysten-incubation/memwal";

export function getMemWal() {
  return MemWal.create({
    key: process.env.MEMWAL_PRIVATE_KEY!,
    accountId: process.env.MEMWAL_ACCOUNT_ID!,
    serverUrl: process.env.MEMWAL_SERVER_URL ?? "https://relayer.memory.walrus.xyz",
    namespace: "my-app",
  });
}
```

Namespace strategy: `owner + namespace` is the isolation boundary. Use one
namespace per app by default, then split by user, team, or feature when a
single app needs separate memory spaces.

Relayer choice: use staging/testnet for learning and prototypes; use
production/mainnet for production data. Do not mix staging credentials with
mainnet relayer configs.

## Vercel AI SDK Integration

```ts
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { streamText } from "ai";
import { withMemWal } from "@mysten-incubation/memwal/ai";

const model = withMemWal(openai("gpt-4o"), {
  key: "<your-delegate-key>",
  accountId: "<your-account-id>",
  serverUrl: "https://relayer.memory.walrus.xyz",
  namespace: "chat",
  maxMemories: 5,
  autoSave: true,
  minRelevance: 0.3,
});

const result = streamText({
  model,
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "What do you remember about me?" }],
});
```

The middleware automatically:
- Recalls relevant memories before generation
- Extracts and saves facts from conversations after generation

---

## OpenClaw / NemoClaw Plugin

For OpenClaw agent integration, use the `@mysten-incubation/oc-memwal` plugin.

### Install

```bash
openclaw plugins install @mysten-incubation/oc-memwal
```

### Configure

Add to `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`:

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "slots": { "memory": "oc-memwal" },
    "entries": {
      "oc-memwal": {
        "enabled": true,
        "config": {
          "privateKey": "${MEMWAL_PRIVATE_KEY}",
          "accountId": "0x...",
          "serverUrl": "https://relayer.memory.walrus.xyz"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Lifecycle hooks run automatically:
- `before_prompt_build` — injects relevant memories as context
- `before_reset` — saves session summary
- `agent_end` — captures last response

---

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| `health()` returns error | Check relayer URL is correct and reachable |
| `recall()` returns empty | Verify namespace matches what was used in `remember()` |
| `recall()` returns unrelated filler | Recall is top-K without a default relevance threshold; filter by `distance`, for example `distance < 0.7` |
| `401 Unauthorized` | Usually wrong `MEMWAL_PRIVATE_KEY`, key not registered on the account, account ID mismatch, or staging/mainnet mismatch. Check `.env.local` and dashboard credentials |
| SDK import errors | Run `pnpm add @mysten-incubation/memwal` — check Node.js ≥ 18 |
| Manual client errors | Install peer deps: `@mysten/sui @mysten/seal @mysten/walrus` |
| Direct Sui reads fail or examples look stale | Prefer `SuiGrpcClient` from `@mysten/sui/grpc`; JSON-RPC snippets using `SuiClient` / `getFullnodeUrl` may be stale |
| `forget` expectations are unclear | Current relayer `POST /api/forget` removes vector index rows so memories are unrecallable; Walrus blobs persist until epoch expiry |

---

## Brand Terminology

Until product confirms a canonical naming pass, these are the **working** assumptions reflected across this doc, the SDKs, and the relayer. Treat them as descriptive, not authoritative.

| Surface | Canonical term | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Product / docs / UI | **Walrus Memory** | Used in marketing copy, user-facing dashboards, and prose docs |
| Package / env vars / internal shorthand | **memwal** | Used in `@mysten-incubation/memwal`, `pip install memwal`, `MEMWAL_*` env vars, internal logs, and codepaths |

If you're writing user-facing copy, prefer "Walrus Memory". If you're writing an env var, import path, or grep-target, prefer `memwal`. Don't mass-rename existing identifiers — that requires a coordinated migration outside this skill's scope.
