# Agent Instructions

This file is the single source of truth for agent instructions in this repository.

## What This Is

EmitSignal is a real-time notification platform. Publishers POST messages to named topics; subscribers receive them live via SSE. Emails and push notifications are dispatched asynchronously via BullMQ workers.

## Commands

**Always use `bun`, never `npm`, `yarn`, `pnpm`, or `node`.** Use `bunx` instead of `npx`. Bun auto-loads `.env` — do not add `dotenv`. Prefer Bun APIs (`Bun.serve()`, `bun:sqlite`, `Bun.file`, `Bun.$`) over third-party equivalents.

```bash
# Root (workspace-wide)
bun install            # install all dependencies
bun format             # format with Prettier (run before every commit)
bun format:check       # check formatting without writing
bun lint               # ESLint across all packages
bun lint:fix           # ESLint with auto-fix
bun test               # run all package tests

# Start everything via Docker (recommended for dev)
docker compose -f packages/emitsignal-docker/docker-compose.dev.yml up

# Server (packages/emitsignal-server)
bun run dev            # API server with --watch
bun run dev:worker     # all BullMQ workers with --watch
bun run db:migrate     # Prisma migrate dev
bun run db:seed        # seed the database
bun run db:studio      # open Prisma Studio
bun run db:generate    # regenerate Prisma client
bun test               # run server tests (Bun test runner)
bun test src/path/to/file.test.ts  # run a single test file

# Website (packages/emitsignal-website)
bun run dev            # Vite dev server on :5000
bun test               # Vitest

# Mobile (packages/emitsignal-mobile)
bun run start          # Expo dev server
bun run ios            # iOS simulator
bun run android        # Android emulator
bunx expo lint         # lint mobile package
```

### Server (`packages/emitsignal-server`)

- **Framework:** Elysia on Bun; routes are Elysia plugins in `src/http/`
- **Source layering:** `src/lib/` is infrastructure only — singletons, side effects, and external connectors (Prisma, logger, auth, event bus, cache, queues, storage, rate limiting). `src/utils/` holds pure, stateless helpers with no Prisma/Redis/singleton dependency. `src/services/` holds application rules that may touch the database (topic, message, topic access, billing, push, transactional emails). Put new code in the narrowest of the three that fits; if a helper needs Prisma, it is a service, not a util.
- **Path alias:** `#/*` → `./src/*`. Use it for every cross-folder import; keep `./sibling` relative only within the same directory.
- **Tests:** `<module>.spec.ts` inside a `__tests__/` folder in the **same directory as the module under test** — e.g. `services/billing/get-user-plan.ts` → `services/billing/__tests__/get-user-plan.spec.ts`. Never collect specs into a catch-all `__tests__/` at the root of a subtree; that is how specs drift away from the modules they cover.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL via Prisma; schema at `prisma/schema.prisma`; generated client at `src/generated/prisma/`
- **Queues:** BullMQ backed by Redis (`src/lib/queue/`); three queues — `email`, `push`, `schedule`; workers run in `src/workers/`
- **SSE fanout:** `src/lib/event-bus.ts` — an in-process `EventEmitter` that powers the listen endpoints. Single-node only; replace with Redis pub/sub for multi-node. Transport plumbing (headers, frame encoding, heartbeat/cleanup) lives in `src/lib/sse.ts`; `GET /topics/:name/listen` and `GET /listen` are thin wrappers over one shared handler in `src/http/topic/sse-listen.ts`.
- **Auth:** Better Auth (`src/lib/auth.ts`) — magic link, passkey, API keys, optional GitHub OAuth. Auth is resolved per-request in `src/http/auth/plugin.ts`; supports cookie-based sessions (web) and `Bearer <session-token>` (mobile/CLI).
- **Rate limiting:** `rate-limiter-flexible` via Redis (`src/lib/rate-limit/`); applied globally via `src/http/plugins/rate-limit-plugin.ts`. Fails open if Redis is unavailable.
- **File storage:** provider-switched via `FILE_STORAGE_PROVIDER` env — `local` (default) or `s3` (`src/lib/storage/`)
- **Email provider:** switched via `EMAIL_PROVIDER` env — `log` (default/dev), `smtp`, or `resend`
- **Log ingestion:** switched via `LOG_INGESTION_PROVIDER` env — `stdout` (default) or `betterstack`; when a provider is set, `src/lib/logger.ts` adds a second Pino transport target alongside stdout/pretty. Falls back to stdout-only when `LOG_INGESTION_TOKEN` is missing.
- **Environment:** validated at startup by TypeBox schema in `src/schema/environment.ts`; all config accessed via the `environment` export

### Publish API

`POST /publish/<topic>` accepts either JSON body or a header-based format (parsed in `src/http/topic/header-publish.ts`). Non-JSON requests use headers like `title`, `x-priority` (`1`–`5` or `low`/`high`/`urgent`), `x-tags`, `x-delay` (unix timestamp or relative like `5m`, `2h`). Publish immediately fires the in-process bus and enqueues a push job; scheduled messages skip the bus and go straight to the schedule queue.

### Website (`packages/emitsignal-website`)

- **Framework:** TanStack Start (file-based routing in `src/routes/`)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4
- **Auth client:** `src/lib/auth-client.ts` — Better Auth React client pointed at `VITE_API_URL`
- **Path alias:** `#/*` → `./src/*`
- **Tests:** Vitest + Testing Library

### Mobile (`packages/emitsignal-mobile`)

- **Framework:** Expo SDK 56 / React Native 0.85.3 / Expo Router 56
- **Path alias:** `@/` → project root
- **Auth:** `@better-auth/expo` with Bearer session tokens
- **Context providers** (in `app/_layout.tsx`): `ThemeProvider` → `DebugSectionsProvider` → `SessionProvider` → `DeviceProvider`
- **Styling:** `StyleSheet.create()` for component styles; theme-aware colors via `useThemeColor()`, light/dark via `useColorScheme()`, palette in `constants/theme.ts`
- **Expo Router conventions:** files in `app/` become routes automatically; `(group)` for route groups without a URL segment; `[param]` for dynamic routes; `_layout.tsx` defines the layout for a directory; `+not-found.tsx` for 404s
- Use React Native components from `react-native`, never web elements

### Shared (`packages/emitsignal-shared`)

Common TypeScript types (`Message`, `Topic`, `Subscription`, `Webhook`, etc.) and API helpers used by website and mobile.

## Code Style

- Functional components only; no class components
- No `any` — TypeScript strict mode enforced everywhere
- No abbreviations in identifiers (`subscription`, not `s`; `priority`, not `prio`)
- No inline `if` expressions
- `interface` for object shapes, `type` for unions/aliases
- Generics: descriptive names (`TResponse`, not `T`)
- File names: kebab-case; component names: PascalCase
- Composition over inheritance
- Explicit return types on exported functions
- Early returns over nested conditionals; optional chaining (`?.`) and nullish coalescing (`??`)

### Imports

- ES modules only (`import`/`export`)
- Use the package's path alias for cross-folder imports; keep relative paths within a directory
- Group imports: external libraries, then aliased internal modules, then relative
- Type-only imports use the `type` keyword: `import type { Message } from '...'`

### Naming

- Components: PascalCase (`ThemedText`, `HomeScreen`)
- Hooks: camelCase starting with `use` (`useThemeColor`)
- Files: kebab-case (`use-theme-color.ts`, `themed-text.tsx`)
- Types/interfaces: PascalCase, descriptive
- True constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE

### File Organization

- Co-locate related files (component + styles + types)
- Use platform-specific extensions when needed (`.ios.tsx`, `.web.ts`)

### Comments

Comment sparingly. A comment earns its place only when the code alone would let
someone break something important — otherwise leave it out and let the code speak.

Write one when, and only when:

- Removing it would let a reader silently break correctness or security (e.g. why
  webhook signatures verify against the raw body, not the re-serialized JSON).
- Ordering or placement is load-bearing and not obvious from reading top to bottom.
- The code looks wrong or redundant but is deliberate (a loop that intentionally
  does not short-circuit, an early return that is safe despite appearances).
- An external contract is being matched (a provider's wire format, a spec).

Do **not** write one to:

- Restate what the next line does (`// Only whether a secret exists` above
  `hasSecret: !!secretCiphertext`).
- Label a section, a constant, or an obviously-named function.
- Explain where code was placed or which folder it belongs to.
- Narrate a change, decision history, or what the code used to do.

Prefer one tight line over three. If a comment needs a paragraph, the code
probably needs a better name or a smaller function instead.

## Commit Rules

Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/): `<prefix>: <description>`.

- Run `bun format` before committing; if Prettier modifies files, stage them and add a final `chore: Source Format` commit as the last commit in the sequence.
- Do **not** add `Co-authored-by:` trailers.
- Do **not** add AI attribution footers anywhere — no "🤖 Generated with Claude Code" (or similar) in commit messages, PR descriptions, or issue comments.
- Avoid commit bodies/footers unless the change has a breaking or high-impact side effect.
- Split commits by logical area; keep each commit focused on one concern.

| Prefix     | Use when                           |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `feat`     | New feature                        |
| `fix`      | Bug fix                            |
| `refactor` | No bug fix, no new feature         |
| `style`    | Formatting/whitespace only         |
| `docs`     | Documentation only                 |
| `test`     | Adding/updating tests              |
| `chore`    | Maintenance, deps, tooling         |
| `perf`     | Performance improvement            |
| `ci`       | CI/CD changes                      |
| `build`    | Build system or dependency changes |

### Commit Splitting

- Split changes into one or more commits by area, context, or logical grouping
- Do not add hard rules by commit type — use your judgment
- Keep each commit focused on a single concern

### Co-Author Trailer

- Never add `Co-authored-by:` for the agent under any circumstances

### Formatting Workflow

1. Before committing, run `bun format` at the project root
2. If `prettier` modified any files, stage those changes and add a final commit:
    ```
    chore: Source Format
    ```
3. This formatting commit must be the last in the sequence
