# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

ttt is a terminal text editor written in Go, using tcell for terminal rendering. The Go module name is `ttt` (in go.mod).

## Build & Test Commands

```sh
make build        # builds to bin/ttt
make run          # build + run
make test         # go test ./...
make fmt          # gofmt -w .
make lint         # golint ./...
go test ./internal/core/buffer/   # run tests for a single package

# Open a multi-folder workspace
bin/ttt --workspace project.ttt

# Open specific folders or files
bin/ttt ~/projectA ~/projectB file.go
```

## Architecture

The codebase follows a strict layered architecture: **core → view → render → term → ui**, with `workspace` sitting alongside as an independent support layer. The core layer has zero terminal dependencies and is fully unit-testable in isolation.

### Layers

- **`internal/core/`** — UI-agnostic editor engine. Must never import terminal or rendering packages.
  - `buffer/` — Line-based text storage (`[]string`), rune-level insert/delete, file I/O (load/save)
  - `cursor/` — Visual column cursor with goal-column preservation for vertical movement
  - `undo/` — Command-pattern undo/redo via `EditCommand` interface (InsertRune, DeleteRange, InsertLine)
  - `highlight/` — Regex-based per-line syntax highlighting (`Highlighter` interface with `Span` output)
  - `buffers/` — Multiple buffer management (list + active index)

- **`internal/view/`** — Viewport (scrolling, cursor-to-screen mapping) and status bar rendering

- **`internal/render/`** — Diff-based renderer: compares prev/curr cell grids and emits minimal updates

- **`internal/terminal/`** — Integrated terminal emulator. Wraps `hinshun/vt10x` for VT escape sequence parsing and `creack/pty` for PTY lifecycle management. Provides the backing state for terminal tabs.

- **`internal/term/`** — Terminal abstraction via `Screen` interface. `TcellScreen` is the real implementation; `MockScreen` is used in tests. Only this package imports `tcell`. Also defines `DirectColor` and `CellAttr` types for direct RGB color rendering (used by the terminal emulator to bypass the style map for 256-color support).

- **`internal/ui/`** — Window manager and pane system. `Window` binds a `Rect`, `Viewport`, and `Buffer` together. `WindowManager` tracks focus across windows. Also contains `terminal_widget.go` (renders vt10x grid as direct-color cells, handles key-to-VT translation), `root.go` (ForceKeys and RawKeyConsumer interface for terminal key routing), and `content_split.go` (OnTopClick/OnBottomClick for focus routing between editor and bottom panel).

- **`internal/workspace/`** — Multi-folder workspace management. `Folder` and `Workspace` types track one or more project roots, with `IsRepo` git-detection, `FolderForFile` lookup (longest-prefix match), and JSON-based workspace file loading/saving (`.ttt` files). The editor falls back to `cwd` when no folders are explicitly provided.

- **`cmd/ttt/main.go`** — Entry point with event loop. Wires all components together, handles key dispatch, viewport scrolling, and redraw. Accepts a `--workspace <file>` flag to open a saved workspace, or folder/file paths as positional arguments.

### Design Principles

1. **UX comes first.** Implement the UI feel and look first, then the functionality. When making design decisions, prioritize user experience over implementation simplicity. If a feature needs good navigation, discoverability, or interaction patterns, invest in that rather than taking shortcuts.
2. **Single source of truth for layout.** When Render computes layout values (positions, offsets), store them on the struct so event handlers reuse them directly instead of recalculating — divergent calculations cause click offset bugs.

### Key Design Constraints

- Cursor `Col` is a visual column (rune-based), not a byte index — all line-length calculations use `[]rune()`.
- The renderer uses double-buffering (prev/curr cell grids) to minimize terminal writes.
- `Screen` interface keeps tcell isolated — the rest of the codebase never imports tcell directly (except `cmd/ttt/main.go` for event types).
- **Never hardcode colors.** All colors must go through the theme system (`internal/config/theme.go` → `StyleDef` → `term.Style` constants → `buildStyleMap`). Add a new `StyleDef` field to `ThemeConfig`, a `term.Style` constant, and wire it in `buildStyleMap()`. Widgets reference `term.Style*` constants, never color values. The one exception is the integrated terminal, which uses direct RGB color rendering via `DirectColor`/`CellAttr` to support 256-color output.
- **Terminal colors** are configured via the `terminal` field in `ThemeConfig` (`TerminalColors`), which holds 16 ANSI colors plus foreground/background defaults.
- The diff view layers syntax highlighting on top of diff background colors using `BgStyle` layering.
- **RawKeyConsumer interface**: when the integrated terminal is focused, all key events are routed directly to the PTY. Only force-keys (Ctrl+`) bypass this to allow toggling the terminal panel.
- Async PTY output wakes the event loop via `PostEvent`/`EventInterrupt`.
- **Global search** (`search_widget.go`) shells out to `rg` (ripgrep) with debounced input (`search.debounce` in settings.json, default 350ms). Uses a generation counter and mutex to prevent concurrent searches from racing. Editor search highlights are tied to the search panel lifecycle — cleared when switching away, re-applied from existing results when switching back.

### Keybinding System & tcell Key Mapping

Keybindings are defined in `internal/config/keybindings.go` (`DefaultKeybindings()`) and converted to tcell key constants via `comboToTcell()` in `cmd/ttt/keys.go`. The matching happens in `matchKey()` in `internal/ui/root.go`.

**Critical: tcell control key behavior.** For control keys (`r < ' '`), tcell posts events with **both** the `KeyCtrl*` constant **and** `ModCtrl` set (see `vendor/.../tcell/v2/input.go:452`). When registering control key bindings in `comboToTcell`, do NOT strip `ModCtrl` — the registered modifier must match what tcell delivers, otherwise `matchKey()` will fail silently.

**Ctrl+Backtick (`` ctrl+` ``):** Maps to `KeyCtrlSpace` (value 64) in tcell because Ctrl+` sends NUL (0x00), same as Ctrl+Space. This is a terminal-level constraint, not a bug. Both `ctrl+backtick` and `ctrl+space` produce the same tcell event — they cannot be bound to different commands. Currently `ctrl+backtick` is bound to `terminal.toggle`.

**Force keys:** Bindings in the `forceKeyCommands` map (`cmd/ttt/commands.go`) are registered via `root.AddForceKey()` and are checked even when a `RawKeyConsumer` (like the integrated terminal) has focus. `terminal.toggle` must remain a force key.

### LSP Integration

Language server support lives in `internal/lsp/`. Servers are configured per-language in `~/.config/ttt/extensions.json`. The LSP client uses JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio with Content-Length framing — no external dependencies.

- `jsonrpc.go` — codec (send/receive with Content-Length framing)
- `protocol.go` — minimal LSP type definitions (initialize, document sync, completions, signature help)
- `client.go` — LSP client with async read loop and request/response channel matching
- `manager.go` — one client per language, lazy-started on first use
- `extensions.go` — config loading from `extensions.json`
- `cmd/ttt/lsp.go` — bridge converting `lsp.CompletionItem` → `ui.CompletionItem`

Async completions and signature help use the same `PostEvent(EventInterrupt)` pattern as git blame. Document sync is full-document (not incremental). Auto-completion triggers on every text change with a configurable debounce timer (`autocomplete.debounce` in settings.json, default 150ms). Signature help triggers on `(` and `,` characters, dismissed on `)`.

### Testing

The project has three levels of testing:

**Unit tests** (`internal/*/`) — Standard Go tests for individual packages. The core layer is fully testable without any terminal dependency. Run with `go test ./internal/core/buffer/` or `make test` for all.

**E2E tests** (`tests/e2e/`) — Go tests that wire up the full `App` with a `tcell.SimulationScreen`. The `testHarness` (`harness_test.go`) creates a temp directory with sample files, builds the complete app (config, commands, keybindings, renderer), and provides helpers: `pressKey()`, `pressRune()`, `click()`, `exec()`, `screenText()`, `assertContains()`. The watcher-aware `waitForFileChange()` helper blocks on `PollEvent` to receive real fsnotify events and dispatches them through the reconciliation path. These tests run single-threaded (no event loop goroutine) — the test drives events and redraws manually.

**Functional blackbox tests** (`tests/functional/`) — JavaScript tests using vitest + `tui-use` CLI that drive the real compiled `bin/ttt` binary in a real terminal. The `tui.js` wrapper provides: `start()` (launches the binary), `snapshot()` (captures screen), `type()` / `press()` / `pressChord()` (input), `waitFor()` (poll until text appears), `waitStable()` (wait for screen to settle), `exec()` (open command palette and run a command). These tests catch integration issues that the Go-level tests miss (e.g., launch-time watcher sync was caught here). Run with `cd tests/functional && pnpm test`. The binary must be built first (`make build`). Tests run sequentially (`fileParallelism: false`) and each test kills any leftover tui-use sessions in `beforeEach`.

### Test expectations for new features

Every new feature or bug fix should include tests at multiple levels:

1. **Unit tests** — for core logic that lives in `internal/core/` or has non-trivial algorithms.
2. **E2E tests** — when the feature involves editor state (cursor, buffer, selection, commands). Use the `testHarness` to wire up the app and verify behavior programmatically.
3. **Functional tests** — when possible. These catch the most bugs because they exercise the real binary end-to-end. Cover the happy path at minimum; add a negative/edge case if there's an obvious one (e.g., no-op on last line for join lines, no-op with no selection for case transforms).

Functional tests with `tui` are the highest-value tests. Use `tui.exec("Command Name")` for command palette, `tui.pressChord("ctrl+k", "x")` for keybindings, and `tui.snapshot()` to verify results.

### Implementation patterns

- **Undo contract**: all buffer mutations must go through the undo system via an `EditCommand` (in `internal/core/undo/`). Never modify `Buf.Lines` directly — create or reuse a command struct so undo/redo works.
- **Command naming**: use `domain.verbNoun` — e.g. `editor.joinLines`, `fold.toggle`, `multicursor.selectAll`.
- **Selection operations**: check `Selection.Active` first. Use `Selection.Range(cursor.Line, cursor.Col)` for bounds. Convention: if no selection, operate on all lines (for line-based commands) or no-op (for text transforms).
- **Keybindings**: `ctrl+shift` combos are unreliable in terminals — avoid them. Use `ctrl+k <key>` chords for new commands. Check `DefaultKeybindings()` in `internal/config/keybindings.go` before assigning to avoid collisions. If no obvious binding exists, leave the command as command palette only — not every command needs a keybinding.

### Post-implementation review

After a feature is implemented and tests pass, review all changes for cleanup: dead code, unnecessary complexity, naming inconsistencies, or missing edge cases. Fix anything related to the feature in the same PR. If you spot something unrelated that needs attention, create a GitHub issue for it instead of fixing it in the current PR.

### Dependencies

Key external dependencies beyond the Go standard library:

- `github.com/gdamore/tcell/v2` — terminal rendering
- `github.com/creack/pty` — PTY management for the integrated terminal
- `github.com/hinshun/vt10x` — VT escape sequence parsing for the integrated terminal
