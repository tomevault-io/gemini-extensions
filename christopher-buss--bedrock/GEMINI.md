# Bedrock Project Context

## What is Bedrock?

Infrastructure-as-Code deployment tool for Roblox, written in TypeScript. Modern
replacement for [Mantle](https://github.com/blake-mealey/mantle) (Rust-based
tool no longer maintained).

## Architecture

- **Language**: TypeScript (ES modules)
- **Runtime**: Bun
- **Auth**: Roblox Open Cloud APIs only (no ROBLOSECURITY)
- **Toolchain**: Vite+ (`vp pack` builds, `vp test` runs Vitest, `vp run`
  orchestrates tasks)
- **Lint**: eslint from monorepo root only (`pnpm lint`), no per-package lint
  scripts

## Architecture Quick Reference

**Pattern**: FCIS (Functional Core, Imperative Shell) + Ports

```

- **Core**: Pure functions, no side effects, easy to test
- **Shell**: Orchestrates I/O, calls core with data from adapters
- **Ports**: Interfaces defining what adapters must implement
- **Adapters**: Concrete implementations (Gist, Open Cloud HTTP, etc.)

## Testing Requirements (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Every line of production code must be written in response to a failing test.

**RED → GREEN → REFACTOR cycle:**

1. **RED:** Write failing test for desired behavior
2. **GREEN:** Write minimum code to pass
3. **REFACTOR:** Clean up while tests stay green

**Commit cadence:** The pre-commit hook (`hk`) runs lint, typecheck, test, and
build, so a pure-RED commit is rejected before it can land. Work RED → GREEN in
the working tree, then commit RED + GREEN **together** as one commit per
behaviour slice. REFACTOR lands as a separate commit only when refactoring adds
value for that slice.

**Git history must show TDD compliance — one commit per behaviour slice.**

**Test levels:**

| Layer    | Test with         | Isolation                                                                |
| -------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Core     | Unit tests        | None needed                                                              |
| Shell    | Integration tests | Fake adapters                                                            |
| Adapters | Adapter tests     | Injected fake transport (e.g. `fakeFetch`, `@bedrock-rbx/ocale/testing`) |
| E2E      | Scenario tests    | Real APIs                                                                |

**Coverage**: 100% required (statements, branches, functions, lines)

**Naming**: `it("should <behavior>")` - enforced by ESLint

**Anti-patterns (will be rejected):**

- Writing implementation before tests
- Testing mock behavior instead of real behavior
- Mocking without understanding dependencies
- Suppressing surviving mutants with `Stryker disable` directives. Kill the
  mutation with a test or refactor the code so a test can observe it.

### Public API examples

Add a JSDoc `@example` block to any symbol exported from a package's
`src/index.ts` barrel **where the example adds value** — i.e. the usage is
non-trivial, has surprising edge cases, or the return shape isn't obvious from
the signature. Skip `@example` on pass-through re-exports and trivial getters.

Examples are dual-purpose:

- `pnpm gen:example-tests` compiles every `@example` code block into an
  `it(...)` test in `<source>.example.spec.ts`. The generator prepends
  `import { expect, it } from "vitest";` as a file header, so source blocks
  **omit** that import -- include only the imports for the symbols being
  demonstrated. Each block should include `expect(...)` assertions that prove
  the claim.
- The same blocks are rendered into the public docs site by TypeDoc;
  `typedoc-plugin-replace-text` strips `expect(...)` lines (and any stray vitest
  import, as a safety net) so readers see a clean usage sample.

Format:

````ts
/**
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { myFn } from "@bedrock-rbx/pkg";
 *
 * const result = myFn({ foo: 1 });
 * expect(result).toEqual({ ok: true });
 * ```
 */
````

One well-chosen `@example` is the target. Add a second only when a single block
genuinely cannot convey the behavior — e.g. a success case plus a qualitatively
different failure mode. More examples are not better; resist the urge to
enumerate permutations of the same call. If you find yourself reaching for a
third block, the symbol probably needs clearer types or a split, not more docs.

See `docs/adr/003-testing-strategy.md` for full details.

## Type Conventions

These conventions shape how new code is written and reviewed in this repo.

- **`JSONValue` is an ambient global** provided by `better-typescript-lib`
  (loaded via `@isentinel/tsconfig`'s `libReplacement: true`). It is the return
  type of `JSON.parse` and the canonical "any parsed JSON shape" type across the
  repo. Do not annotate `JSON.parse` call sites as `: unknown`, and do not
  propose `type-fest`'s `JsonValue` as a substitute: the ambient type is already
  in scope everywhere the base tsconfig is extended.

- **Wire types express nullability as `T | undefined`**, not `T | null`, because
  `unicorn/no-null` is enforced under `src/**`. Parsers (for example
  `parseGamePassResponse`) normalize JSON `null` to `undefined` at the wire
  boundary so public types only surface `undefined`. When an interface describes
  a raw wire body that is consumed without a parser (error response types, for
  example), document the null-vs-absent distinction at the declaration rather
  than widening the type to `| null`.

## Key Decisions

See `docs/adr/` for full Architecture Decision Records.

- **TypeScript over Rust**: Community contribution accessibility
- **Open Cloud only**: ROBLOSECURITY is deprecated, Open Cloud is the future
- **GitHub Gists for state**: Zero external service, works with
  BEDROCK_GITHUB_TOKEN
- **Multi-format config**: Support TS, JS, YAML, JSON, Luau via c12

## Common Commands

```bash
pnpm install           # Install dependencies
pnpm build             # Build for production
pnpm test              # Run tests
pnpm lint              # Check/fix linting
pnpm typecheck         # TypeScript validation
pnpm gen:example-tests # Generate *.example.spec.ts from @example JSDoc blocks
pnpm mutate:changed    # Mutation test files touched in the current git diff
```

### Running Bun directly against workspace source

Direct `bun` invocations of workspace code need `--conditions source` to resolve
cross-package imports without a prior build:

```bash
bun --conditions source packages/bedrock/src/index.ts
```

Workaround until
[oven-sh/bun#28851](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues/28851) lands — drop
the flag and this note afterwards.

## Development Workflow

### Before Committing

1. Run `pnpm gen:example-tests` (regenerate `*.example.spec.ts` from `@example`
   blocks)
2. Run `pnpm lint` (auto-fixes style issues)
3. Run `pnpm build` (must succeed)
4. Run `pnpm test` (must pass)
5. Run `pnpm typecheck` (must pass)
6. Run `pnpm mutate:changed` (no surviving mutants on touched `src/**` files)

### Pull Requests

PR titles are linted by commitlint (`.github/workflows/lint-pr-title.yaml`) —
**verify both rules before `gh pr create` / `gh pr edit --title`:**

1. **Subject lower-case**: kebab-case every uppercase letter after
   `type(scope):`, including code identifiers (`mergeConfig` → `merge-config`,
   `GamePassesClient` → `game-passes-client`).
2. **Scope-enum**: if a scope is present it MUST be one of
   `core, deps, e2e, example-ci-codegen, example-minimal, global, ocale, testing, tsconfig, vite, website`.
   The `bedrock` package was renamed to `@bedrock-rbx/core`, so changes in
   `packages/bedrock/` take the `core` scope. `ci`, `chore`, `docs`, `build`,
   `refactor` are **types, not scopes** — write `ci: …` with no scope, not
   `fix(ci): …`.
3. **Consumer-useful subject**: PR titles become changelog entries for people
   installing the published package. Write what _changed in the package from the
   consumer's perspective_, not how the work was organised. Internal terminology
   (`slice-1`, `post-merge cleanup`, `finalize`, `wire up`, issue numbers,
   sub-task names) is meaningless in a changelog. Prefer concrete,
   outcome-focused phrasing: `add game-passes client` over
   `slice-1 client implementation`; `clean up public jsdoc` over
   `post-merge cleanup`. If the change is invisible to consumers (pure internal
   refactor, docs-only), say what actually changed
   (`remove internal references from public jsdoc`) rather than labelling the
   pass.

### Releases

Versioning + publishing run on pnpm's native versioning (ADR-029), configured
under the `versioning` key in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`. `@bedrock-rbx/core` and
`@bedrock-rbx/ocale` are a **fixed** group (shared version, release together).
Any PR changing a published package MUST record a change intent (`pnpm change`,
or `pnpm change --bump none <pkg>` for a deliberately non-releasing change) — a
blocking CI check fails the PR otherwise. PRs touching only docs/CI/private
packages need none. Releases ship by merging the auto-generated
`ci: version packages` PR; never hand-edit package versions.

Intent files live in `.changeset/` in the changesets format, but the Changesets
CLI is gone: `pnpm change` records, `pnpm change status` previews,
`pnpm version -r` consumes. `.changeset/ledger.yaml` is generated — never edit
it.

**Pre-1.0 bump policy**: bump types apply literally at any version (`major` on
0.x jumps straight to 1.0.0 — there is no special 0.x mode), so until 1.0 never
write `major`. Breaking change → `minor` (0.1.0 → 0.2.0, the breaking boundary
for `^0.x` consumers); feature or fix → `patch` (0.1.0 → 0.1.1). This is now
enforced by `versioning.maxBump: minor`, which must be lifted deliberately for
the 1.0.0 release.

### Creating Issues

Use GitHub issue templates for:

- Bug reports
- Feature requests
- Documentation improvements

### Making Architectural Decisions

Bedrock is pre-1.0 and solo-maintained. ADRs are for decisions a future
maintainer could not reconstruct from the commit, PR body, and code. Default to
no ADR.

**Write an ADR when the decision is one of:**

1. **Package or technology choice.** Selecting between candidates where the
   tradeoffs mattered (c12 vs cosmiconfig, Stryker vs mutmut, Vite vs tsup), or
   adopting something that locks the project into a vendor, paradigm, or runtime
   whose removal would require redesign (Effect-TS, a DI container). A utility
   with no meaningful alternative considered (nanoid, a type-only package, a
   test helper) does not qualify.
2. **New category of integration.** A new auth mechanism, state backend, or API
   provider. A new endpoint on an existing Open Cloud client does not qualify.
3. **Cross-package pattern.** A new port, layer, or boundary that other packages
   must adopt. One more adapter inside an established port does not qualify.
4. **State or wire contract.** State file shape, serialization format, config
   schema, or diff algebra changes.
5. **Security.** Auth flow, secret handling, or trust boundary.
6. **Mandatory developer policy.** A new required check, test level, or commit
   gate. CI tweaks and retuning existing tooling do not qualify.
7. **Breaking change to a published package.** A breaking change to the public
   API or wire/state contract of `@bedrock-rbx/core` or `@bedrock-rbx/ocale`
   that a downstream consumer could not reconstruct from the changeset and
   changelog. Pre-1.0, breaking changes are still allowed in minor bumps; the
   ADR bar is whether the rationale needs explaining.

**Gray-zone calibration:**

| Scenario                                          | ADR? |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ---- |
| New endpoint on an existing Open Cloud client     | no   |
| New Open Cloud auth flow                          | yes  |
| `pnpm add nanoid` (no alternative considered)     | no   |
| Choosing c12 over cosmiconfig for config loading  | yes  |
| Adopting Effect-TS or equivalent                  | yes  |
| Tuning Stryker thresholds                         | no   |
| Requiring mutation testing on CI                  | yes  |
| New resource kind following ADR-018/019 pattern   | no   |
| New resource kind that needs its own diff algebra | yes  |

**Never ADR:** bug fixes, tests, behavior-preserving refactors, docs,
performance tweaks.

**Process when an ADR is warranted:**

1. Use the `adr` agent. Brainstorm collaboratively; do not auto-generate.
2. Walk the Q&A: context, options, criteria, consequences, review. One question
   at a time; never assume.
3. Draft incrementally. Mark Accepted before implementation.
4. After Accepted, evolve via dated amendments, never retroactive rewrites of
   Decision or Consequences.

See `docs/adr/006-adr-enforcement.md` for full rationale and the 2026-04-23
amendment recalibrating the bar.

## Constraints

1. **Open Cloud only**: Never use ROBLOSECURITY or legacy APIs
2. **No secrets in state**: State files contain only resource IDs (public data)
3. **Backwards compatibility**: Maintain Mantle migration path
