# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

ML Odyssey is a Mojo-based AI research platform for reproducing classic research papers. The project uses a
comprehensive 4-level hierarchical planning structure with automated GitHub issue creation.

**Current Status**: Active implementation — Mojo 1.0 migration complete, 6 neural network
architectures implemented (~198K lines of Mojo), 298+ tests across 433 test files.

## Ecosystem Context

Odyssey is part of the
[HomericIntelligence](https://github.com/HomericIntelligence) organization.
It is a **standalone ML training framework** — not a distributed agent or
microservice.

**This repo's role**: Mojo-based ML framework for reproducing classic research
papers. The shared library (`src/projectodyssey/`) provides tensor ops, autograd, layers,
and training infrastructure that all paper implementations build on.

**What this repo is NOT** (to prevent AI agents from making incorrect
assumptions):

- **Not part of a distributed agent mesh.** Zero integration with ai-maestro,
  NATS, or any agent registration/task queue. AchaeanFleet and Myrmidons
  handle that.
- **No promotion path to AchaeanFleet.** Implementations live entirely in this
  repo as Mojo libraries and executables.
- **No REST API.** No agent registration endpoint, no REST client.
- **"Agents" here = Claude Code automation** (`.claude/agents/`) for
  development workflow (code generation, PR creation, CI), not runtime
  distributed services.

**Key sibling repos** (see
[README.md](README.md#part-of-homericintelligence) for the full table):

## ⚠️ CRITICAL RULES - READ FIRST

### 🚫 NEVER Push Directly to Main

**The `main` branch is protected. ALL changes MUST go through a pull request.**

❌ **ABSOLUTELY PROHIBITED:**

```bash
git checkout main
git add <files>
git commit -m "changes"
git push origin main  # ❌ BLOCKED - Will be rejected by GitHub
```

**Why this is prohibited:**

- Bypasses code review and CI checks
- Can break production immediately
- Violates GitHub branch protection rules
- Makes it impossible to track changes properly

✅ **CORRECT WORKFLOW (Always Use PRs):**

```bash
# 1. Create feature branch
git checkout -b <issue-number>-description

# 2. Make changes and commit
git add <files>
git commit -m "type(scope): description"

# 3. Push feature branch
git push -u origin <issue-number>-description

# 4. Create pull request
gh pr create \
  --title "Brief description" \
  --body "Closes #<issue-number>" \
  --label "appropriate-label"

# 5. Enable auto-merge
gh pr merge --auto --rebase
```

**Emergency Situations:**

- Even for critical CI fixes, CREATE A PR
- Even for one-line changes, CREATE A PR
- Even if you're fixing your own mistake, CREATE A PR
- NO EXCEPTIONS - Always use the PR workflow

- [Agent Configurations](/.claude/agents/) - 29 agents
- [Skills](https://github.com/HomericIntelligence/ProjectMnemosyne) - 61 skills total;
  57 live in the external ProjectMnemosyne repo, 4 remain local. Use `/mnemosyne:advise`

## Working with Agents

This project uses a hierarchical agent system for all development work. **Always use agents** as the primary
method for completing tasks.

### Agent Hierarchy

See [agents/hierarchy.md](agents/hierarchy.md) for the complete agent hierarchy including:

- 6-level hierarchy (L0 Chief Architect → L5 Junior Engineers)
- Model assignments (Opus, Sonnet, Haiku)
- All 29 agents with roles and responsibilities

### Key Agent Principles

1. **Always start with orchestrators** for new section work
1. **All outputs** must be posted as comments on the GitHub issue
1. **Link all PRs** to issues using `gh pr create --issue <number>` or "Closes #123" in description
1. **Minimal changes only** - smallest change that solves the problem
1. **No scope creep** - focus only on issue requirements
1. **Reply to each review comment** with `✅ Fixed - [brief description]`
1. **Delegate to skills** - Use "Use the X skill to..." pattern for automation

### Skill Delegation Patterns

Agents delegate to skills using five patterns: **Direct** (invoke for specific action),
**Conditional** (decide based on condition), **Multi-Skill Workflow** (chain skills for a goal),
**Skill Selection** (pick skill based on analysis), **Background vs Foreground** (automatic
`run-precommit` vs explicit `gh-create-pr-linked`).

**Available Skills** (58 total across 11 categories):

- **GitHub**: gh-review-pr, gh-fix-pr-feedback, gh-create-pr-linked, gh-check-ci-status,
  gh-implement-issue, gh-reply-review-comment, gh-get-review-comments, gh-batch-merge-by-labels,
  verify-pr-ready
- **Worktree**: worktree-create, worktree-cleanup, worktree-switch, worktree-sync
- **Phase Workflow**: phase-plan-generate, phase-test-tdd, phase-implement, phase-package,
  phase-cleanup
- **Mojo**: mojo-format, mojo-test-runner, mojo-build-package, mojo-simd-optimize,
  mojo-memory-check, mojo-type-safety, mojo-lint-syntax, validate-mojo-patterns,
  check-memory-safety, analyze-simd-usage
- **Agent System**: agent-validate-config, agent-test-delegation, agent-run-orchestrator,
  agent-coverage-check, agent-hierarchy-diagram
- **Documentation**: doc-generate-adr, doc-issue-readme, doc-validate-markdown,
  doc-update-blog
- **CI/CD**: run-precommit, validate-workflow, fix-ci-failures, install-workflow,
  analyze-ci-failure-logs, build-run-local
- **Quality**: quality-run-linters, quality-fix-formatting, quality-security-scan,
  quality-coverage-report, quality-complexity-check
- **Testing & Analysis**: test-diff-analyzer, extract-test-failures, generate-fix-suggestions,
  track-implementation-progress
- **Review**: review-pr-changes, create-review-checklist

### Key Development Principles

1. KISS - *K*eep *I*t *S*imple *S*tupid -> Don't add complexity when a simpler solution works
1. YAGNI - *Y*ou *A*in't *G*onna *N*eed *I*t -> Don't add things until they are required
1. TDD - *T*est *D*riven *D*evelopment -> Write tests to drive the implementation
1. DRY - *D*on't *R*epeat *Y*ourself -> Don't duplicate functionality, data structures, or algorithms
1. SOLID - *S**O**L**I**D* ->
  . Single Responsibility
  . Open-Closed
  . Liskov Substitution
  . Interface Segregation
  . Dependency Inversion
1. Modularity - Develop independent modules through well defined interfaces
1. POLA - *P*rinciple *O*f *L*east *A*stonishment - Create intuitive and predictable interfaces to not surprise users

- [Clean Coding Principles](<https://www.pullchecklist.com/posts/clean-coding-principles>)

### Documentation Rules

- **Issue-specific outputs**: Post as comments on the GitHub issue using `gh issue comment <number>`
- **Developer documentation**: `/docs/dev/` (architectural decisions, design docs)
- **Team guides**: `/agents/` (quick start, hierarchy, templates)
- **Never duplicate** documentation across locations - link instead
- See `.claude/shared/github-issue-workflow.md` for GitHub issue read/write patterns

### Language Preference

#### Mojo First - With Pragmatic Exceptions

**Default to Mojo** for ALL ML/AI implementations:

- ✅ Neural network implementations (forward/backward passes, layers)
- ✅ Training loops and optimization algorithms
- ✅ Tensor operations and SIMD kernels
- ✅ Performance-critical data processing
- ✅ Type-safe model components
- ✅ Gradient computation and backpropagation
- ✅ Model inference engines

**Use Python for Automation** when technical limitations require it:

- ✅ Subprocess output capture (Mojo v1.0 limitation - cannot capture stdout/stderr)
- ✅ Regex-heavy text processing (no Mojo regex support in stdlib)
- ✅ GitHub API interaction via Python libraries (`gh` CLI, REST API)
- ⚠️ **MUST document justification** (see ADR-001 for header template)

**Rule of Thumb** (Decision Tree):

1. **ML/AI implementation?** → Mojo (required)
1. **Automation needing subprocess output?** → Python (allowed, document why)
1. **Automation needing regex?** → Python (allowed, document why)
1. **Interface with Python-only libraries?** → Python (allowed, document why)
1. **Everything else?** → Mojo (default)

### Why Mojo for ML/AI

- Performance: Faster for ML workloads
- Type safety: Catch errors at compile time
- Memory safety: Built-in ownership and borrow checking
- SIMD optimization: Parallel tensor operations
- Future-proof: Designed for AI/ML from the ground up

### Why Python for Automation

- Mojo's subprocess API lacks exit code access (causes silent failures)
- Regex support not production-ready (mojo-regex is alpha stage)
- Python is the right tool for automation - not a temporary workaround

**See**: [ADR-001: Language Selection for Tooling](docs/adr/ADR-001-language-selection-tooling.md)
for complete language selection strategy, technical evidence (test results), and justification
requirements

See `/agents/README.md` for complete agent documentation and `/agents/hierarchy.md` for visual hierarchy.

### Tensor Architecture

The project uses a dual-type tensor system (see [ADR-012](docs/adr/ADR-012-parametric-dtype-tensor-architecture.md)):

- **`Tensor[dtype: DType]`** -- compile-time typed tensor with SIMD-like element access. Used inside layer implementations.
- **`AnyTensor`** -- runtime-typed tensor for trait interfaces, collections, serialization, and autograd tape.

Both conform to `TensorLike` trait. Zero-copy conversion via `as_tensor[dtype]()` and `as_any()`.

```mojo
from projectodyssey.core.any_tensor import AnyTensor, zeros
from projectodyssey.tensor.tensor import Tensor
```

## Claude 4 & Claude Code Optimization

This section provides guidance on optimizing interactions with Claude 4 (Sonnet and Opus) and
Claude Code features including extended thinking, agent skills, sub-agents, hooks, and output
styles.

### Extended Thinking

**When to Use Extended Thinking**: Claude 4 models support extended thinking for complex
reasoning tasks. Use extended thinking when:

- Analyzing complex codebases or architectural decisions
- Debugging multi-layered issues with unclear root causes
- Planning multi-step refactoring or migrations
- Evaluating tradeoffs between multiple design approaches
- Reasoning about edge cases and failure modes

**When NOT to Use Extended Thinking**:

- Simple CRUD operations or boilerplate code
- Well-defined tasks with clear specifications
- Repetitive tasks (formatting, linting, etc.)
- Tasks with clear step-by-step instructions already provided

### Thinking Budget Guidelines

Extended thinking consumes tokens. Use appropriate budgets based on task complexity:

| Task Type | Budget | Examples | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Simple** | None | Fix typo | Mechanical changes |
| **Standard** | 5K-10K | Add test, function | Well-defined |
| **Complex** | 10K-20K | Restructure, migrate | Dependencies |
| **Architecture** | 20K-50K | Design pattern | Deep analysis |
| **System-wide** | 50K+ | CI failures | Root cause |

**Budget Conservation Tips**:

1. **Provide context upfront** - Include relevant file contents, error messages, and constraints
2. **Break down complex tasks** - Split large problems into smaller, focused subtasks
3. **Use examples** - Show expected patterns rather than describing them
4. **Reference existing code** - Point to similar implementations as templates

### Agent Skills vs Sub-Agents

**Decision Tree**: Choose between skills and sub-agents based on task characteristics:

```text
Is the task well-defined with predictable steps?
├─ YES → Use a Skill from ProjectMnemosyne
│   ├─ Is it a GitHub operation? → Use gh-* skills
│   ├─ Is it a Mojo operation? → Use mojo-* skills
│   ├─ Is it a CI/CD task? → Use ci-* skills
│   └─ Is it a documentation task? → Use doc-* skills
│
└─ NO → Use a Sub-Agent
    ├─ Does it require exploration/discovery? → Use sub-agent
    ├─ Does it need adaptive decision-making? → Use sub-agent
    ├─ Is the workflow dynamic/context-dependent? → Use sub-agent
    └─ Does it need extended thinking? → Use sub-agent
```

**Skills** - Use for automation with predictable workflows (available in ProjectMnemosyne):

- **Characteristics**: Declarative YAML, fixed steps, composable, fast
- **Best for**: GitHub API calls, running tests, formatting code, CI workflows
- **Examples**: `gh-create-pr-linked`, `mojo-format`, `run-precommit`
- **Access**: Use `/mnemosyne:advise` to search and invoke skills

**Sub-Agents** - Use for tasks requiring reasoning and adaptation:

- **Characteristics**: Full Claude instance, extended thinking, exploratory, slower
- **Best for**: Architecture decisions, debugging, code review, complex refactoring
- **Examples**: Documentation Engineer, Implementation Specialist, Review Engineer

**Hybrid Approach**: Sub-agents can delegate to skills mid-workflow (e.g., call `gh-create-pr-linked`
after completing analysis and drafting).

### Hooks Best Practices

Hooks enable proactive automation and safety checks. Use hooks for guardrails and background tasks.

**Hook Design Principles**:

1. **Fail fast** - Catch errors early in the development cycle
2. **Clear messages** - Explain WHY the hook triggered and HOW to fix
3. **Strict enforcement** - NEVER use `--no-verify`. Fix hook failures instead of bypassing.
4. **Idempotent** - Hooks should be safe to run multiple times

**Common Hooks for ML Odyssey**:

| Hook Type | Trigger | Purpose | Implementation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Safety** | compile | Zero-warnings | Fail on warnings |
| **Safety** | pr_create | Issue link | Block if missing |
| **Safety** | git_push | Block main | Fail if direct |
| **Automation** | file_save | Auto-format | Run pixi run mojo format |
| **Automation** | git_commit | Pre-commit | Execute hooks |
| **Automation** | pr_merge | Cleanup | Remove worktree |

See `.claude/shared/error-handling.md` for retry strategies and timeout handling in hooks.

### Output Style Guidelines

Use repo-relative file paths with line numbers for code references. Structure PR/issue comments with
`## Summary`, `## Changes Made`, `## Files Modified`, `## Verification` sections. Prioritize code
review feedback by severity (Critical / Important / Nice to Have).

See [Output Style Guidelines](.claude/shared/output-style-guidelines.md) for complete examples.

### Tool Use Optimization

Make independent tool calls in parallel (Read, Grep, Glob). Use absolute paths in Bash commands
(cwd resets between calls). Use dedicated tools (Read/Grep/Glob/Edit) rather than Bash for
file operations. Prefer `&&`-chained commands for atomicity.

See [Tool Use Optimization](.claude/shared/tool-use-optimization.md) for complete examples.

### Agentic Loop Patterns

For complex tasks, follow Exploration → Planning → Execution: gather context first (Read/Grep/Glob),
design solution with subtasks, then implement iteratively with early verification. Iterate on
failures rather than perfecting upfront.

Use agentic loops for: complex refactoring, unclear root-cause debugging, design tradeoff decisions.
Skip for: simple well-defined tasks, boilerplate generation, mechanical changes.

See [Tool Use Optimization](.claude/shared/tool-use-optimization.md#agentic-loop-patterns) for details.

## Delegation to Agent Hub

.claude/ is the centralized location for agentic descriptions. Sub-agents reference
`.claude/agents/*.md` for roles, capabilities, and prod fix learnings. Skills have been migrated to ProjectMnemosyne.

### Shared Reference Files

All agents and skills reference these shared files to avoid duplication:

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `.claude/shared/common-constraints.md` | Minimal changes principle, scope discipline |
| `.claude/shared/documentation-rules.md` | Output locations, before-starting checklist |
| `.claude/shared/pr-workflow.md` | PR creation, verification, review responses |
| `.claude/shared/mojo-guidelines.md` | Mojo v1.0+ syntax, parameter conventions |
| `.claude/shared/mojo-anti-patterns.md` | 64+ test failure patterns from PRs |
| `.claude/shared/error-handling.md` | Retry strategy, timeout handling, escalation |

### MCP Integration

**DEPRECATED**: GitHub MCP integration is being removed. Use `gh` CLI directly for all
GitHub operations to avoid token overhead.

Skills with `mcp_fallback` in YAML frontmatter will be updated to use direct CLI calls only.

### Mojo Development Guidelines

This project uses **Mojo 1.0.0b2** (pinned in pixi.toml).
Official docs: <https://mojolang.org/docs/>

**Quick Reference**: See [mojo-guidelines.md](/.claude/shared/mojo-guidelines.md) for v1.0+ syntax

**Critical Patterns** (1.0):

- **Constructors**: Use `out self` (not `mut self`)
- **Mutating methods**: Use `mut self`
- **Ownership transfer**: Use `^` operator for List/Dict/String
- **List initialization**: Use literals `[1, 2, 3]` not `List[Int](1, 2, 3)`
- **Parametric function values**: Add `thin` keyword to function-value parameter
  types — `op: def[T: DType](Scalar[T]) thin -> Scalar[T]` (the `thin` is required
  in 1.0; was implicit in 0.26)
- **Closure capture**: `def foo() {mut}:` or `def foo() capturing[_]:` — the
  `unified` keyword was removed in 1.0
- **Tests**: existing hand-rolled `def main()` test files run via `mojo run`
  (not `mojo test` — that subcommand was removed in 1.0)
- **UnsafePointer**: non-null by design; use `Optional[UnsafePointer[T]]` for
  nullable pointers and check via `is None` / `is not None`

**Migration recipes** (for code still using 0.26 idioms): see
[docs/dev/mojo-1.0-migration-recipe.md](docs/dev/mojo-1.0-migration-recipe.md).

**Common Mistakes**: See [mojo-anti-patterns.md](/.claude/shared/mojo-anti-patterns.md) for 64+ failure patterns

**Compiler as Truth**: When uncertain, test with `mojo build` - the compiler is authoritative

**Compile-Time Import Constraints**:

- Import failures in Mojo are compile-time errors with no runtime exception handling
- Cannot write "negative import tests" (tests that expect imports to fail)
- Invalid imports cause compilation to fail before any code executes
- This differs from Python where import errors can be caught at runtime
- Plan test coverage accordingly: only test valid imports that compile successfully

**JIT stability**: Mojo JIT is stable as of `1.0.0b2.dev2026052506` (upstream fix for
[modular/modular#6413](https://github.com/modular/modular/issues/6413)). Execution crashes
(`mojo: error: execution crashed`, `libKGENCompilerRTShared.so` stack frames, SIGILL) are
real bugs. Do NOT add retry loops, `continue-on-error: true`, or skip markers to work around
them. File a minimal reproducer at modular/modular and fix forward.

## Environment Setup

This project uses Pixi for environment management:

```bash
# Pixi is already configured - dependencies are in pixi.toml
# Mojo is the primary language target for future implementations
```

**`pixi.toml` is the single source of truth for all dependencies** (Python packages, Mojo
version, dev tools, and scripts) — including inside Docker/container contexts. Do NOT add
dependencies to `requirements*.txt` or `pyproject.toml` — those files are not used by this
project and carry no authority. Always update `pixi.toml` when adding or changing a dependency.

**Environment Variables**: Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and customize for your system:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

See `.env.example` for all available variables (container user mapping, native vs Podman
execution, log levels, etc.). The justfile auto-detects most values, so `.env` is optional
for typical setups.

**Pixi env layout (detached-environments)**: `.pixi/config.toml` sets
`detached-environments = true`, so pixi stores environments in the per-user cache
directory (`~/.cache/pixi/envs/…`) rather than inside the workspace. This prevents
the host and container pixi envs from colliding at the same filesystem path:

- **Host env** (`~/.cache/pixi/…`) — used by pre-commit hooks and direct `pixi run`
  calls on the host (Python tools: ruff, mypy, bandit).
- **Container env** (`/home/dev/.cache/pixi/…`) — used by `just build`, `just test-mojo`,
  and all other justfile recipes that route through `podman compose exec`. Mojo must run
  from the container because it requires glibc ≥ 2.32 (host glibc may be older).

Pixi creates a convenience **symlink** at `.pixi/envs → <per-user-cache>/envs` pointing to
the actual env location. This symlink is expected and harmless (it's ignored by git via
`.pixi/.gitignore`). An actual directory at `.pixi/envs/` would indicate a misconfiguration;
a pre-commit guard catches that case. If `.pixi/envs` is an actual directory, run
`rm -rf .pixi/envs && pixi install`.

**GLIBC Constraint**: CI runners use Ubuntu with GLIBC 2.35 (Mojo requires 2.32+). Any
native binaries built locally must be compatible with this version to avoid CI failures.
If you're unable to run tests locally due to GLIBC version mismatch, see the
Troubleshooting section "Mojo Test Execution and GLIBC Compatibility" for solutions.

## Common Commands

### Justfile Build System

The project uses [Just](<https://just.systems/>) as a unified command runner for local development and CI/CD consistency.

#### Quick Reference

```bash
# Show all available recipes
just --list

# Get help
just help

# Development commands
just build                  # Build project in debug mode
just test                   # Run all tests
just test-mojo             # Run only Mojo tests
just format                # Format all files

# CI-specific commands (match GitHub Actions)
just validate           # Full validation (build + test)
just build              # Build shared package
just package           # Compile package (validation only)
just test-mojo          # Run all Mojo tests
just test-group PATH PATTERN  # Run specific test group
just pre-commit               # Run pre-commit hooks
just pre-commit-all               # Run pre-commit hooks on all files

# Training and inference
just train                 # Train LeNet-5 with defaults
just train lenet5 fp16 20  # Train with FP16, 20 epochs
just infer lenet5 ./weights  # Run inference

# Podman management
just podman-up             # Start development environment
just podman-down           # Stop environment
just shell          # Open shell in container
```

### Container Registry (GHCR)

Images published to GHCR: `ghcr.io/HomericIntelligence/Odyssey:{main,main-ci,main-prod}`.

```bash
podman pull ghcr.io/HomericIntelligence/Odyssey:main  # ~2GB runtime
just podman-up    # Start dev environment
just shell        # Open shell in container
just podman-build-ci runtime  # Build locally
```

### Why Use Justfile?

1. **Consistency**: Same commands work locally and in CI
2. **Simplicity**: Easy-to-read recipes vs complex bash scripts
3. **Documentation**: Self-documenting with `just --list`
4. **Reliability**: Ensures identical flags between local dev and CI

### CI Integration

GitHub Actions workflows use justfile recipes to ensure consistency:

```yaml
# Example from comprehensive-tests.yml
- name: Run test group
  run: just test-group "tests/shared/core" "test_*.mojo"

# Example from build-validation.yml
- name: Build package
  run: just build
```

This ensures developers can run `just validate` locally to reproduce CI results exactly.

**See**: `justfile` for complete recipe list and implementation details.

### Development Workflows

**Pull Requests**: See [pr-workflow.md](/.claude/shared/pr-workflow.md)

- Creating PRs with `gh pr create --body "Closes #<number>"`
- Responding to review comments (use GitHub API, not `gh pr comment`)
- Post-merge cleanup (worktree removal, branch deletion)

**GitHub Issues**: See [github-issue-workflow.md](/.claude/shared/github-issue-workflow.md)

- Read context: `gh issue view <number> --comments`
- Post updates: `gh issue comment <number> --body "..."`

**Git Workflow**: Feature branch → PR → Auto-merge (never push to main)

### Agent Testing

Agent configurations are validated in CI on all PRs. Run locally before committing:

```bash
# Run all agent tests
for script in tests/agents/test_*.py tests/agents/validate_*.py; do
    python3 "$script" .claude/agents/
done
```

Tests cover: YAML config validation, agent discovery, delegation patterns, workflow integration,
and Mojo-specific patterns. CI runs these via `.github/workflows/test-agents.yml`.

### Pre-commit Hooks

Pre-commit hooks automatically check code quality before commits. The hooks include a GLIBC-aware
`mojo-format` wrapper (`scripts/mojo-format-compat.sh`) for Mojo code and markdown linting for documentation.

```bash
# Install pre-commit hooks (one-time setup)
pixi run pre-commit install

# Run hooks manually on all files
just pre-commit-all

# Run hooks manually on staged files only
just precommit

# NEVER skip hooks with --no-verify
# If a hook fails, fix the code instead
# If a specific hook is broken, use SKIP=hook-id:
SKIP=trailing-whitespace git commit -m "message"

# Note: SKIP=mojo-format is not needed — use scripts/mojo-format-compat.sh or just shell on incompatible hosts
```

**Mojo Format Compatibility**: The `mojo-format` hook uses `scripts/mojo-format-compat.sh`,
which detects GLIBC incompatibility (Mojo requires GLIBC 2.32+) and exits `0` with a warning
instead of failing the commit on older hosts (Debian Buster/Bullseye, Ubuntu 20.04, etc.).
CI runs on Ubuntu 24.04 (glibc 2.39) and always enforces formatting.
See `docs/dev/mojo-glibc-compatibility.md` for details.

### Pre-Commit Hook Policy - STRICT ENFORCEMENT

`--no-verify` is **ABSOLUTELY PROHIBITED**. No exceptions.

**If hooks fail:**

1. Read the error message to understand what failed
2. Fix the code to pass the hook
3. Re-run `just precommit` to verify fixes
4. Commit again

**Valid alternatives to --no-verify:**

- Fix the code (preferred)
- Use `SKIP=hook-id` for specific broken hooks (must document reason)
  - For `mojo-format` compatibility issues, see `docs/dev/mojo-glibc-compatibility.md`
- Disable the hook in `.pre-commit-config.yaml` if permanently problematic

**Invalid alternatives:**

- ❌ `git commit --no-verify`
- ❌ `git commit -n`
- ❌ Any command that bypasses all hooks

### Configured Hooks

- `mojo format` - Auto-format Mojo code (`.mojo`, `.🔥` files)
- `markdownlint-cli2` - Lint markdown files
- `trailing-whitespace` - Remove trailing whitespace
- `end-of-file-fixer` - Ensure files end with newline
- `check-yaml` - Validate YAML syntax
- `check-added-large-files` - Prevent large files (max 1MB)
- `mixed-line-ending` - Fix mixed line endings

**CI Enforcement**: The `.github/workflows/pre-commit.yml` workflow runs these checks on
all PRs and pushes to `main`.

**See:** [Git Commit Policy](.claude/shared/git-commit-policy.md) for complete enforcement rules.

### Planning Hierarchy

**4 Levels** (managed through GitHub issues):

1. **Section** (e.g., 01-foundation) - Major area of work
1. **Subsection** (e.g., 01-directory-structure) - Logical grouping
1. **Component** (e.g., 01-create-papers-dir) - Specific deliverable
1. **Subcomponent** (e.g., 01-create-base-dir) - Atomic task

All planning documentation is tracked in GitHub issues. Use `gh issue view <number>` to read plans.

### Documentation Organization

The repository uses three separate locations for documentation to avoid duplication:

#### 1. Team Documentation (`/agents/`)

**Purpose**: Quick start guides, visual references, and templates for team onboarding.

### Contents

- Quick start guides (README.md)
- Visual diagrams (hierarchy.md)
- Quick reference cards (delegation-rules.md)
- Configuration templates (templates/)

**When to Use**: Creating new documentation for team onboarding or quick reference.

#### 2. Developer Documentation (`/docs/dev/`)

**Purpose**: Detailed architectural decisions, comprehensive specifications, and design documents.

### Contents

- Mojo patterns and error handling (mojo-test-failure-patterns.md)
- Orchestration patterns (orchestration-patterns.md)
- Backward pass catalog (backward-pass-catalog.md)
- Skills architecture and design (see ProjectMnemosyne for current implementations)

**When to Use**: Writing detailed specifications, architectural decisions, or comprehensive guides.

#### 3. Issue-Specific Documentation (GitHub Issue Comments)

**Purpose**: Implementation notes, findings, and decisions specific to a single GitHub issue.

**Location**: Post directly to the GitHub issue as comments using `gh issue comment`.

See [github-issue-workflow.md](/.claude/shared/github-issue-workflow.md) for read/write patterns
(`gh issue view <number> --comments`, `gh issue comment <number> --body "..."`).

### Important Rules

- ✅ DO: Post issue-specific findings and decisions as comments
- ✅ DO: Link to comprehensive docs in `/agents/` and `/docs/dev/`
- ✅ DO: Reference related issues with `#<number>` format
- ❌ DON'T: Duplicate comprehensive documentation
- ❌ DON'T: Create local files for issue tracking

### 5-Phase Development Workflow

Every component follows a hierarchical workflow with clear dependencies:

**Workflow**: Plan → [Test | Implementation | Package] → Cleanup

1. **Plan** - Design and documentation (MUST complete first)
1. **Test** - Write tests following TDD (parallel after Plan)
1. **Implementation** - Build the functionality (parallel after Plan)
1. **Package** - Create distributable packages (parallel after Plan)
   - Build binary packages (`.mojopkg` files for Mojo modules)
   - Create distribution archives (`.tar.gz`, `.zip` for tooling/docs)
   - Configure package metadata and installation procedures
   - Add components to existing packages
   - Test package installation in clean environments
   - Create CI/CD packaging workflows
   - **NOT just documenting** - must create actual distributable artifacts
1. **Cleanup** - Refactor and finalize (runs after parallel phases complete)

### Key Points

- Plan phase produces specifications for all other phases
- Test/Implementation/Package can run in parallel after Plan completes
- Cleanup collects issues discovered during the parallel phases
- Each phase has a separate GitHub issue with detailed instructions

## Testing Strategy

Two-tier architecture: **Tier 1** layerwise unit tests (every PR, ~12 min, FP-representable special
values 0.0/0.5/1.0/1.5/-1.0/-0.5, all 7 models) and **Tier 2** E2E integration tests (weekly,
real EMNIST/CIFAR-10 datasets). Parametric layers validated with gradient checking (seed=42,
epsilon=1e-5). Run with: `pixi run mojo test tests/models/test_<model>_layers.mojo`

See [Testing Strategy Guide](docs/dev/testing-strategy.md) for full documentation.

## GitHub Issue Structure

All planning is done through GitHub issues with clear structure:

### Issue Body Format

```markdown
## Objective
Brief description (2-3 sentences)

## Deliverables
- [ ] Deliverable 1
- [ ] Deliverable 2

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2

## Dependencies
- Depends on #<parent-issue>
- Related: #<sibling-issue>

## Notes
Additional context
```

### Issue Labels

- `planning` - Design phase
- `testing` - Test development
- `implementation` - Code implementation
- `packaging` - Distribution packages
- `cleanup` - Finalization

### Linking Issues

- Reference in body: `Depends on #123`
- Reference in commits: `Implements #123`
- Close via PR: `Closes #123`

## Working with GitHub Issues

All planning and documentation is managed through GitHub issues directly.

### Creating New Work Items

1. Create a GitHub issue with clear description and acceptance criteria
2. Use appropriate labels (planning, testing, implementation, packaging, cleanup)
3. Link related issues using `#<number>` references

### Tracking Implementation

1. Read issue context: `gh issue view <number> --comments`
2. Post progress updates as issue comments
3. Link PRs to issues: `gh pr create --body "Closes #<number>"`

### Documentation Workflow

1. **Read context first**: `gh issue view <number> --comments`
2. **Post updates**: `gh issue comment <number> --body "..."`
3. **Reference in commits**: "Implements #<number>" or "Closes #<number>"

See `.claude/shared/github-issue-workflow.md` for complete workflow patterns.

### File Locations

- **Scripts**: `scripts/*.py`
- **Logs**: `logs/*.log`
- **Tracked Docs**: `docs/dev/`, `agents/` (reference these in commits)
- **Issue Docs**: GitHub issue comments (not local files)

## Git Workflow

### Branch Naming

- `main` - Production branch (protected, requires PR)
- `<issue-number>-<description>` - Feature/fix branches (e.g., `1928-consolidate-test-assertions`)

### Development Workflow

**IMPORTANT:** The `main` branch is protected. All changes must go through a pull request.

#### Creating a PR (Standard Workflow)

1. **Create a feature branch:**

   ```bash
   git checkout -b <issue-number>-<description>
   ```

1. **Make your changes and commit:**

   ```bash
   git add <files>
   git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
   type(scope): Brief description

   Detailed explanation of changes.

   🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](<https://claude.com/claude-code>)

   Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
   EOF
   )"
   ```

1. **Push the feature branch:**

   ```bash
   git push -u origin <branch-name>
   ```

1. **Create pull request:**

   ```bash
   gh pr create \
     --title "[Type] Brief description" \
     --body "Closes #<issue-number>" \
     --label "appropriate-label"
   ```

1. **Enable auto-merge:**

   ```bash
   gh pr merge --auto --rebase
   ```

   **Always enable auto-merge** so PRs merge automatically once CI passes.

### 🚫 Never Push Directly to Main

**⚠️ CRITICAL:** See [CRITICAL RULES section](#️-critical-rules---read-first) at the top of this document.

**This rule has NO EXCEPTIONS - not even for emergencies.** Always use the PR workflow described there.

## Commit Message Format

Follow conventional commits:

```text
feat(section): Add new component
fix(scripts): Correct parsing issue
docs(readme): Update instructions
refactor(plans): Standardize to Template 1
```

### Worktree and PR Discipline

**One PR per Issue:**

- Each GitHub issue should have exactly ONE pull request
- Do not combine multiple issues into a single PR
- Branch naming: `<issue-number>-<description>`

**Worktree Directory:**

- Create all worktrees in the `worktrees/` subdirectory within the repo
- Naming convention: `<issue-number>-<description>`
- Example: `git worktree add worktrees/123-fix-bug 123-fix-bug`

**Post-Merge Cleanup:**

After a PR is merged/rebased to main:

1. Remove the worktree: `git worktree remove worktrees/<issue-number>-<description>`
2. Delete local branch: `git branch -d <branch-name>`
3. Delete remote branch: `git push origin --delete <branch-name>`
4. Prune stale references: `git worktree prune`

## Labels

Standard labels automatically created by scripts:

- `planning` - Design phase (light purple: #d4c5f9)
- `documentation` - Documentation work (blue: #0075ca)
- `testing` - Testing phase (yellow: #fbca04)
- `tdd` - Test-driven development (yellow: #fbca04)
- `implementation` - Implementation phase (dark blue: #1d76db)
- `packaging` - Integration/packaging (light green: #c2e0c6)
- `integration` - Integration tasks (light green: #c2e0c6)
- `cleanup` - Cleanup/finalization (red: #d93f0b)

## Python Coding Standards

```python

#!/usr/bin/env python3

"""
Script description

Usage:
    python scripts/script_name.py [options]
"""

# Standard imports first

import sys
import re
from pathlib import Path
from typing import List, Dict, Optional

def function_name(param: str) -> bool:
    """Clear docstring with purpose, params, returns."""
    pass
```

### Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Type hints required for all functions
- Clear docstrings for public functions
- Comprehensive error handling
- Logging for important operations

## Markdown Standards

All markdown files must follow these standards to pass `markdownlint-cli2` linting:

- **MD031/MD040**: Fenced code blocks must have blank lines before/after and a language tag
  (` ```python `, ` ```bash `, ` ```mojo `, ` ```yaml `, ` ```text `, etc.)
- **MD032**: Lists must be surrounded by blank lines
- **MD022**: Headings must be surrounded by blank lines
- **MD013**: Lines must not exceed 120 characters (code blocks and URLs exempt)

**Quick check before committing**: blank lines around all code blocks, lists, and headings;
language on all code fences; no lines >120 chars; file ends with newline.

```bash
# Lint markdown locally
pixi run npx markdownlint-cli2 path/to/file.md
```

## Debugging

### Check Logs

```bash
# View script logs
tail -100 logs/*.log

# View specific log
cat logs/<script>_*.log
```

## Troubleshooting

### GitHub CLI Issues

```bash
# Check authentication
gh auth status

# If missing scopes, refresh authentication
gh auth refresh -h github.com
```

### Issue Access Problems

- Check GitHub CLI auth: `gh auth status`
- Verify repository access: `gh repo view`
- Test issue access: `gh issue list`

### Script Errors

- Verify Python version: `python3 --version` (requires 3.7+)
- Check file permissions
- Review error logs in `logs/` directory

### Mojo Test Execution and GLIBC Compatibility

**Issue**: Tests fail to run locally with errors about GLIBC version or missing libraries.

**Root Cause**: Mojo requires GLIBC 2.32+ for test execution, but many Linux distributions
(especially Debian 10, Ubuntu 18.04) ship with older GLIBC versions (2.28, 2.29). Even if
the local Mojo compiler works, the test runtime may fail due to binary incompatibility.

**Solution**: Use Podman or CI for test validation instead of running tests locally:

```bash
# Option 1: Use Podman (recommended for local testing)
just podman-up              # Start container with GLIBC 2.35
just shell                  # Open shell in container
# Inside container:
just test-mojo              # Run tests in container

# Option 2: Use CI for validation
git push origin <branch>    # Push to GitHub
# GitHub Actions will run tests on Ubuntu with GLIBC 2.35
```

**Verification**: Check your local GLIBC version:

```bash
ldd --version | head -1     # Shows GLIBC version
# If output shows < 2.32, use Podman or CI for testing
```

**Note**: The CI environment uses Ubuntu with GLIBC 2.35. Any binaries built locally
must be compatible with this version, or they will fail in CI. Use Podman containers
matching the CI environment to develop locally.
