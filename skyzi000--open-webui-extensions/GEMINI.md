## Global Communication Rules

- Always answer the user in Japanese.
- Instructions intended for the AI (including this document and the return
  values of `Tools` methods) must remain in English, even though user-facing
  replies are in Japanese.

## Repository Structure

This repository contains Open WebUI extensions, with some components managed as Git submodules.

### Submodules

- `graphiti/` - Graphiti memory system extensions (separate repository)
- `references/open-webui/` - Reference submodule

### Working With Open WebUI Core

1. The upstream Open WebUI core lives in the `references` submodule. Before
   consulting or copying code, update the submodule to the latest commit so you
   rely on current behavior.
2. Implement features only after inspecting the actual core and related
   libraries; never guess about undocumented behavior.
3. When adapting snippets, keep them consistent with the upstream style and
   ensure any dependencies are mirrored locally.
4. Before implementing a new Filter/Tool/Action, inspect at least one existing
   implementation of the same type in this repository (and in
   `references/open-webui` if needed) so you follow established patterns and
   edge-case handling.

## Commit Message Rules

### Important: Check Submodule Commit Style First

Before committing to a submodule, **always check the existing commit history** using:

```bash
git log -5 --format=medium
```

Each submodule may have its own commit message style. Follow the existing pattern.

### Graphiti Submodule Style

Uses **Conventional Commits** format:

```text
type(scope): short description

Optional detailed description explaining what and why.
- Bullet points for multiple changes
- Keep each point concise
```

**Types:**

- `feat` - New feature
- `fix` - Bug fix
- `chore` - Maintenance (version updates, dependencies, etc.)
- `docs` - Documentation only
- `refactor` - Code refactoring without feature changes
- `test` - Adding or updating tests

**Scopes:**

- `filter` - Filter components
- `tools` - Tools components
- `pipeline` - Pipeline components
- `action` - Action components

**Examples:**

```text
feat(tools): add get_recent_episodes method for chronological episode retrieval

- Add get_recent_episodes() method with limit/offset pagination
- Sort episodes by created_at in descending order (newest first)
- Optimize database queries to fetch only offset+limit episodes
- Update version to 0.3
```

```text
fix(filter): Fix null pointer exception in D3.js graph tick handler

Add null checks before calling getBBox() on text nodes in the force
simulation tick event.
```

### Root Repository Style

Uses **Conventional Commits** format with English descriptions.

## Development Guidelines

### General Principles

1. **Version Management**
   - Update version numbers when adding features or fixing bugs
   - Follow semantic versioning principles

2. **Before Committing**
   - Verify changes work correctly
   - Check for linting errors
   - Review the commit message style of the target repository/submodule

### Valves vs UserValves

Applies to Tools, Filters, and Pipes.

- Follow the official pattern: declare both classes as nested subclasses of the
  Filter/Tools/Pipe you are implementing, inherit from `BaseModel`, and always
  call `self.valves = self.Valves()` inside `__init__` for admin-controlled
  defaults.
- `Valves` describe instance-wide knobs (API keys, DB backends, semaphore limits,
  etc.) and may include fields like `priority` for filter ordering. `UserValves`
  expose only per-user preferences (feature toggles, language choices, etc.).
- Fetch user valves via
  `self.UserValves.model_validate((__user__ or {}).get("valves", {}))` so that
  raw dict payloads from Open WebUI are validated, missing fields fall
  back to defaults, and you avoid sharing mutable state.
- Treat the object stored under `__user__["valves"]` as a Pydantic model, not a
  dict; access attributes (`__user__["valves"].test_user_valve`) or cast with
  `dict(__user__["valves"])` if you truly need a mapping. Indexing into it as if
  it were a dict returns defaults and ignores user-set values.
- Keep the schemas disjoint and document each `Field` carefully so the UI can
  generate appropriate controls (e.g., `Literal[...]` for dropdowns, `bool` for
  switches). Always include `pass` at the end of each class as recommended in
  the core documentation.
- The current UI does not expose true multi-select widgets, so when you need
  multiple choices, accept comma-separated strings (e.g., `"choiceA,choiceB"`)
  and document that input format for users.

### Tool Implementation

#### General Guidelines

- Assume every public method you add will be called by the AI. Provide precise
  docstrings that describe the purpose, parameters, expected argument formats,
  possible errors, and example correction strategies.
- Tools are never invoked directly by humans; the AI alone decides when to
  call them and assembles the arguments, so design signatures and validation
  with that autonomous caller in mind.
- Expose only callable methods; keep helpers outside of the `Tools` class so the
  AI cannot invoke unsupported operations (method names starting with `_` are
  not an exception).

#### CRITICAL: No Helper Methods in Tools Class

**NEVER define helper methods inside the Tools class, regardless of naming.**

The underscore prefix (`_method`) does NOT hide methods from AI. All methods
inside the Tools class are exposed to AI, which causes:

- Context pollution (AI sees unnecessary methods)
- AI may mistakenly call internal methods and fail

❌ BAD:

```python
class Tools:
    def _helper(self):  # AI CAN invoke this!
        ...
```

✅ GOOD:

```python
def helper(valves, ...):  # Outside class - AI cannot invoke
    ...

class Tools:
    ...
```

#### Documentation for AI Users

- Target audience is AI, running in Docker on OpenWebUI
- AI only sees method docstrings (not class docstrings) and return values
- Include all critical information in method docstrings
- Use Field descriptions to clarify data format requirements
- Do NOT document system-injected parameters (`__user__`, `__event_emitter__`,
  etc.) in docstrings—AI cannot pass them, will be confused, and wastes context

#### Docstring and Schema Constraints

Open WebUI's `parse_docstring()` uses a single-line regex
(`re.compile(r':param (\w+):\s*(.+)')`) to extract `:param` descriptions.
**Only the first line of each `:param` is captured**; continuation lines are
silently discarded. This means critical information (field names, format
examples, usage warnings) on subsequent lines will never reach the LLM.

- **Always write `:param` descriptions as a single line.** If the description
  is too long, move the details into the method-level docstring (before the
  first `:param`) which is captured in full.
- **For `list[dict]` parameters where items have expected keys**, define a
  Pydantic `BaseModel` subclass outside the `Tools` class and use it as the
  item type (e.g., `list[MyItem]`). `list[dict]` generates
  `items: {"type": "object", "additionalProperties": true}` with no
  `properties`, so the LLM must guess field names from the description alone —
  which may itself be truncated by the single-line parser above.

#### Input Validation

- Validate inputs defensively. On invalid arguments, never raise exceptions;
  instead, return structured guidance that tells the AI exactly which field to
  fix and how.

#### Return Payload Budget

- Limit every return payload (success or error) to just the data the AI needs
  for its next action so Tool calls do not waste context window space.

#### Error Handling

- Do not implement fallbacks without clear necessity
- Return clear, actionable error messages
- Provide specific information for AI to understand and address issues
- Anticipate malformed payloads, missing context, or external failures and
  handle them without crashing or raising exceptions.
- When rejecting a request, respond with actionable remediation steps (e.g.,
  "Provide `conversation_id`" or "Retry after refreshing credentials").
- Log or surface enough context in the return payload so the AI can decide
  whether to retry, adjust arguments, or abort.
- Keep return payloads concise; include only the information the AI needs to
  correct its inputs so the context window is not wasted.

### Filter Implementation

#### Toggle Mechanics

- Usually, do NOT set `self.toggle` at all (no True or False needed)
- Only set `self.toggle = True` for filters that need temporary activation via
  the chat UI (e.g., filters you want to enable/disable per conversation)
- When `toggle = True`, a toggle button appears in the UI; when the user enables
  it, both `inlet` and `outlet` run; when disabled, neither runs
- Do not re-check `self.toggle` inside `inlet`/`outlet`; if either function
  runs, the toggle is already ON
