# Adversarial Verifier Hardening

Iteratively patches task verifiers/evals against reward-hacking exploits. Three
agents (Terminus-2 via Harbor) play adversarial roles:

1. **Hacker** — runs with an aggressive exploit prompt, explicitly told to bypass tests.
2. **Fixer** — given the hack trajectory, modifies any task file to block the exploit.
3. **Solver / Oracle** — pre-check and post-fix validation (validates task is solvable & fix doesn't break it).
4. **Targeted replay** (optional, `--replay-enabled`) — after solver accepts the fix, re-runs a constrained hacker on the patched task with the prior exploit as a replay target. If it re-lands, the fix is rejected.

**Pooled / jumper mode** (optional, `--pool-enabled`): tasks share a defense repo served by a host-side `git daemon`. Fixers clone the pool, pull latest, commit, and push; other tasks consume those pushes on their next iteration via a "skip-hacker" path that lets the fixer integrate pool changes instead of attacking.

## Mode flags (two orthogonal axes)

Two independent flags control the loop:

* `--oracle` — selects the **pre-check/validation mechanism**: deterministic
  reference copy (`reference.py → solution.py`) if set, agent solver
  (Terminus-2) if not.
* `--kernelbench-mode` — selects the **prompt/template bundle**: KernelBench
  framing (speedup metric, `eval_kernel.py`, runtime-minimization hacker goal,
  KB-specific fixer template) if set, generic framing (pass/fail reward,
  `test_outputs.py`, verifier-bypass hacker goal, generic fixer template) if
  not.

The two commonly travel together (KernelBench runs pass both, generic
non-KernelBench tasks pass neither), but they're decoupled because nothing forces the
coupling — a generic task with a deterministic reference could use `--oracle`
alone, and a KB-style framing could conceivably run with an agent solver.

| axis | flag | True | False (default) |
|------|------|------|-----------------|
| Pre-check | `--oracle` | `run_oracle_solver` (deterministic) | `run_solver_agent` (Terminus-2) |
| Prompts / templates | `--kernelbench-mode` | KB framing, `eval_kernel.py`, speedup | Generic framing, `test_outputs.py`, reward |
| Hack / solver thresholds | `--hack-threshold` / `--solver-threshold` | KB uses `10` / `0.5` | Default `1.0` / `1.0` |
| `.legitimate` marker | `--no-legitimate-marker` disables | enabled by default | enabled by default |
| `solver_privileged` | N/A when `--oracle` (deterministic) | — | Optional — inject `/solution/` as solver hint |
| Hardened state | — | `output/hardened/<task_id>/` | `output/hardened/<task_id>/` |

## Loop

Pre-check: solver/oracle must pass the original task.

For each iteration (up to `max_iterations`, default 10):
1. **Hacker attacks** (up to `hacker_retries`, default 3). If all fail → task is **robust**.
2. **Fixer patches** the task (one attempt per iteration).
   - Runs in Docker with tests/, solution/ baked in.
   - Edits files in `/logs/artifacts/` (git repo); only committed changes extracted.
   - On retry: previous attempt + solver output mounted read-only.
   - Can mark hack as legitimate via `.legitimate` sentinel (enabled by default; `--no-legitimate-marker` to disable).
3. **Validate**: solver/oracle must still pass. If not, revert; feedback sent to fixer next iteration.
4. **Targeted replay** (if `--replay-enabled`): up to `replay_retries` attempts to reproduce the prior exploit on the patched task. If reward ≥ `hack_threshold`, the fix is rejected (outcome `replay_broke_fix`) and feedback goes to the next fixer turn. Hardened state is only committed when both solver **and** replay agree.

## Batch concurrency

`harden_batch` dispatches on `pool_server` for two distinct drivers:

* **Pool mode (iteration barrier).** When `--pool-enabled`, all active tasks advance one hardening iteration at a time via `asyncio.gather` on per-task generator yields. The barrier keeps the shared pool's history in lockstep — every task observes the same pool state at iter N start, then optionally pushes, then advances. `pool_max_consecutive_syncs` relies on this lockstep to be meaningful. Cost: fast tasks idle at the barrier waiting for slow peers.
* **Pool-disabled mode (independent).** Tasks have no shared mutable state, so each task generator is driven to completion concurrently with no iter-level synchronization. Container concurrency is still capped by `--max-concurrent`. Throughput is strictly higher than barrier mode for uneven task durations.

Both drivers share the same `asyncio.Semaphore(max_concurrent_containers)` acquired inside `_harden_task_phases` for each container-heavy step.

## Key knobs (see `harden --help` for full list)

- `--oracle` — use deterministic pre-check (reference.py → solution.py). Default is agent solver.
- `--kernelbench-mode` — use KB-specific prompts/templates (speedup metric, `eval_kernel.py`). Independent of `--oracle`; KB runs pass both.
- `--no-legitimate-marker` — disable the `.legitimate` sentinel (fixer can't flag a hack as legitimate).
- `--hack-threshold`, `--solver-threshold` — gates on reward/speedup.
- `--harbor-config` — yaml/json Harbor JobConfig defaults to layer under harden overrides.
- `--force-build`, `--image-name` — rebuild control to avoid cache pollution from Dockerfile mutations across iterations. `--image-name` accepts a `{task_id}` placeholder for batch / parallel-process disambiguation (e.g., `--image-name kb-priv-pool-{task_id}` so concurrent harden runs over the same tasks tag-clobber-proof their images).
- `--solver-privileged` (solver mode) — inject `/solution/` into solver env as hint.
- `--hacker-privileged` — mount the evaluation environment (tests/, environment/) read-only at `/eval_env/` so the hacker can whitebox-inspect the verifier.
- `--hacker-feedback` — give hacker read-only access to previous failed attempts.
- `--hacker-privileged-enable-iteration` / `--hacker-privileged-disable-iteration` — turn verifier access on/off starting at a given iteration.
- `--summary-model` — model used for hack / trajectory / journal summaries (defaults derived from the role models).
- `--no-journal`, `--journal-compact-max-iters` — the per-task hacker+fixer journal is on by default; disable it or tune when it compacts.
- `--fixer-prompt-file`, `--fixer-prompt-after-iter` — inject extra fixer guidance from a file, optionally only from iteration N onward.
- `--replay-enabled`, `--replay-retries` — enable targeted-replay post-solver gate; a constrained hacker re-attempts the prior exploit on the patched task, and the fix is rejected if it re-lands. Reuses hacker model/turns/timeout knobs, and inherits `--hacker-privileged` (if the hacker had `/eval_env/` access, replay does too — the exploit may reference it).
- `--pool-enabled`, `--pool-bootstrap-dir <hardened_task_dir>`, `--pool-port <N>` — enable jumper / pooled mode. Opt-in; default off. Host-side `git daemon` serves a bare pool repo at `<output_dir>/pool.git`; fixer containers clone/push to `git://host.docker.internal:<port>/pool.git`. Port auto-bumps on conflict.
- `--pool-integrate-bootstrap` — flip the batch driver's pool-cursor seeding policy: instead of seeding fresh tasks to current pool HEAD (default, skip integration), leave the cursor empty so iter 0 becomes a skip-hacker pool-sync iter that ports the bootstrap into local. Only useful when `--pool-bootstrap-dir` is a task-agnostic defense scaffold; for KernelBench-style bootstraps that include a task-specific `reference.py`, leave this off (it would corrupt sibling tasks).

### Pooled (jumper) mode

When `--pool-enabled`:
- **Linux Docker Engine >= 20.10 required** — fixer containers reach the host-side daemon via `host.docker.internal:host-gateway` in docker-compose.yaml, and `host-gateway` is a Linux-only special value added in 20.10.
- **Security**: the `git daemon` runs with `--enable=receive-pack` and no authentication. By default it binds to the **docker0 bridge IP** (auto-detected via `ip addr show docker0`) so only containers on that bridge can reach it — closes the LAN-facing surface. If docker0 isn't detectable, falls back to `0.0.0.0` with a warning; firewall the port off from untrusted networks in that case. Note: privileged-hacker containers share the same bridge and could in principle probe the gateway IP for an open port — the threat model assumes hackers are research LLMs, not adversarial attackers.
- Bootstrap: a fresh bare repo is initialized from `--pool-bootstrap-dir`'s `tests/`; commit message `[bootstrap] from <path>`. If `<output_dir>/pool.git/` already exists, it's reused (so you can pre-populate the pool with any history).
- Per-task last-seen SHA at `<task_output_dir>/pool_sha.txt`. **Default batch behavior**: every fresh task's cursor is pre-seeded to the current pool HEAD (in `batch.harden_batch`) so iter 0 runs the hacker normally instead of burning a fixer turn integrating a task-specific bootstrap. Pass `--pool-integrate-bootstrap` to skip the pre-seed: PoolCursor falls back to its `None` default, making iter 0 a skip-hacker pool-sync iter — same as standalone `harden_task`. Persisted only at commit points (fix validated, pool-sync no-op, or legitimate flag) — an iteration that crashes does NOT silently mark pool commits as seen.
- Iteration branches:
  - If pool HEAD advanced beyond last-seen → **skip hacker**, show fixer a git log of new commits. Valid fixer outcomes: port into local, refine pool, or no-op (`outcome: pool_sync_noop`).
  - Else → normal hacker → fixer flow; fixer may additionally push to the pool.
- Last-seen advance rule: at iter end on fix_applied, `last_seen` is refreshed to our own most recent pool commit (matched by `author=harden-fixer-<task_id>` with trailing " <" anchor so `task-1` doesn't match `task-10`), NOT current HEAD — this avoids burning the next iter on self-acknowledging our own push, while still triggering skip-hacker if a concurrent task's commit is ahead of ours.
- Concurrency: git's push semantics handle it (non-fast-forward rejection → agent does `git pull --rebase` and retries). No host-side lock.
- `iter_info["pool_own_commit"]` records the fixer's **most recent** authored commit visible in the pool at iter end on a validated fix — which may be from an earlier iteration if the fixer didn't push this iter but had pushed previously. It is not necessarily the SHA of this iter's push.

## Outputs

Each task produces:

- `<output_dir>/hardened/<task_id>/` — the full patched task (canonical hardened state).
- `<output_dir>/<task_id>/result.json` — per-task summary.
- `<output_dir>/<task_id>/task_config.json` — full config used for this task.
- `<output_dir>/<task_id>/jobs/` — Harbor job dirs (trajectories, verifier output, artifacts).
- `<output_dir>/batch_summary.json`, `<output_dir>/batch_config.json` — batch mode only.

### result.json schema

```jsonc
{
  "task_id": "<string>",
  "status": "robust" | "max_iterations" | "solver_failed_precheck" | "error" | "unknown",
  "oracle": true,
  "kernelbench_mode": true,
  "hardened_dir": "<path>",
  "iterations": [
    {
      "iteration": 0,
      "hack_reward": 1.23,
      "fix_applied": false,
      "outcome": "fixed" | "fix_failed" | "no_changes" | "legitimate" | "hacker_failed" | "replay_broke_fix" | "pool_sync_noop",
      "replay_attempted": false,
      "replay_reward": null,
      "pool_advanced": false,         // pooled mode only
      "pool_sha_start": "<sha>",      // pooled mode only
      "pool_own_commit": "<sha>"      // pooled mode only; set when fixer pushed this iter
    }
  ],
  "pool_enabled": true                  // pooled mode only
}
```

### Terminal statuses (resume is automatic when `--output-dir` already exists)

- `robust` — hacker failed all retries, OR legitimate marker hit threshold.
- `max_iterations` — loop exhausted `--max-iterations` without converging.
- `solver_failed_precheck` — pre-check could not pass the task (may be broken/unsolvable).

Non-terminal (re-run on resume): `error`, `unknown`, missing `result.json`.

## Things easy to get wrong

- **Fixer's git repo lives at `/logs/artifacts/`**, not `/`. Edits to `/tests/` are ephemeral. The fixer prompt reminds the agent; if you change the prompt, keep this detail.
- **`shutil.copytree` on broken symlinks**: `prepare_fixer_environment` uses `ignore_dangling_symlinks=True` where needed.
- **Dockerfile mutation across iterations**: hardened state cascades — once `hardened_dirty`, force_build + separate `image_name` on every subsequent run. The loop tracks this explicitly.
- **Hack vs solver threshold defaults**: The built-in defaults (1.0 / 1.0) fit generic mode. KernelBench runs MUST pass `--hack-threshold 10 --solver-threshold 0.5`.
- **KernelBench needs BOTH mode flags**: `--oracle` alone gives a deterministic pre-check with generic prompts; `--kernelbench-mode` alone gives KB prompts with an agent solver pre-check. Real KB runs need both.
