## 1. What Quiver Is

Quiver is a decentralised, event-sourced package manager. It installs and manages software through Git repositories. The `quiver.core` daemon exposes REST and WebSocket APIs for managing:

- **Arrows** — packages (manifests fetched from Git repos)
- **Collections** — curated catalogs of arrows
- **Runtimes** — execution contexts (install, run, stop, uninstall)

Module path: `github.com/rabbytesoftware/quiver.core`

---

## 2. Layer Architecture

Six layers under `internal/`, one binary at `cmd/quiver/`. **Dependencies flow strictly downward** — upper layers never import lower layers upward.

```
cmd/quiver/          ← Cobra CLI entry point
internal/internal.go ← DI wiring (New + Start)
internal/api/        ← HTTP + WebSocket delivery (Gin)
internal/app/        ← Orchestration: usecases, repositories, hub
internal/engine/     ← Stateless business engines
internal/adapter/    ← Storage backends (SQLite via Asynx + GORM)
internal/core/       ← Process singletons: config, paths, logger, fns
internal/domain/     ← Pure types and state machines (no I/O, no internal imports)
```

### Layer responsibilities

| Layer | Key rule |
|-------|----------|
| `domain/` | No I/O. No imports from other internal packages. Pure types + state machines. |
| `core/` | Config, embedded metadata, path resolution, logger, FetchNShare I/O. |
| `adapter/` | Asynx event store (SQLite) + generic `Store[T,K]` (sqlite/memory). |
| `engine/` | Manifold, Vault, Wizard, DepTree, Netbridge. Each is independent — no engine imports another. |
| `app/` | Owns Asynx aggregates, composes engines + adapters into usecases, owns `WebSocketHub`. |
| `api/` | Gin routes, Gorilla WebSocket. Maps HTTP ↔ usecase calls ↔ DTOs. Knows nothing about Asynx/commands/projections. |

### DI construction order (in `internal.New`)

```
engine.New(ctx)
adapter.New()
app.New(engines, adapters)
apiv0.New(appContainer)
api.New(appContainer.Hub, buildInfo, v0Container)
```

Read `internal/internal.go` for the current wiring.

---

## 3. Domain Model

Read files under `internal/domain/` for current struct fields — they change without notice. Below are stable descriptions of what each type represents.

### 3.1 Namespace

A string type (`domain.Namespace`) in `domain/user/repo` format, optionally with `@ref` and optionally with a 4th segment for quiver-hosted arrows (`domain/user/repo/auid`). Key operations: strip ref, extract ref, replace ref, validate, extract segments (QUID = first 3, AUID = 4th), derive clone URL.

Read `internal/domain/namespace.go` for exact methods.

### 3.2 Arrow

The canonical installed package aggregate. Holds the compiled manifest (name, description, version, variables, netbridge port definitions, per-OS targets) plus installation metadata (installed ref, constraint, timestamp).

**ArrowState** is a string enum with the following valid transitions:

| From | Can transition to |
|------|------------------|
| `absent` | `ready` |
| `ready` | `running`, `installing`, `uninstalling`, `updating`, `outdated` |
| `running` | `stopping`, `detached` |
| `stopping` | `ready`, `draining` |
| `draining` | `ready` |
| `detached` | `ready`, `stopping` |
| `installing` | `ready`, `absent` |
| `uninstalling` | `absent`, `ready` |
| `updating` | `ready`, `absent` |
| `outdated` | `ready`, `uninstalling` |
| `removed` | (terminal) |

`IsActive()` returns true for: `running`, `stopping`, `draining`, `installing`, `updating`.

### 3.3 ArrowRuntime

Execution state for an arrow. Tracks current state, active execution (method being run, progress steps, PID, workdir, variables), and last return value (outcome, steps, variables). Lives in `internal/domain/runtime/`.

### 3.4 Collection

A followed catalog of arrows. Holds namespace, follow timestamp, list of arrows in the collection, and collection metadata.

### 3.5 Target

Per-OS entry inside an Arrow manifest. Contains hardware requirements, tool/service dependency edges, exported environment values, and a lifecycle map (`install`, `update`, `execute`, `stop`, `uninstall`, user-defined methods).

### 3.6 Lifecycle method constants

```
_install   _uninstall   _update   _execute   _stop
```

These are the names passed to `wizard.Start` and appear as method keys in Arrow.Targets.

### 3.7 OS identifiers

String enum covering: `linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`, `windows/amd64`, `windows/arm64`, `darwin/amd64`, `darwin/arm64`. `domain.CurrentOS()` returns the running platform.

---

## 4. Event Sourcing — Asynx Pattern

The project uses `github.com/char2cs/asynx`. Every state change flows through a Command.

### 4.1 Command contract

Every command struct must implement five methods. Read any file under `internal/app/repositories/*/internal/commands/` to see current examples. The five methods:

- `AggregateID() string` — returns `namespace.String()`, identifies the aggregate instance
- `EventName() string` — format: `aggregate.action.<namespace>` (e.g. `arrow.added.github.com/u/r@v1`)
- `ShouldSnapshot() bool` — whether to write a snapshot row after this event; see §4.3 (under asynx v0.8 this is unconditionally `true`)
- `Validate(current *T) error` — pure; receives current aggregate state (nil = doesn't exist yet); returns `asynxModels.ErrValidation` wrapped in context
- `EmitEvent(current *T) T` — pure; returns next aggregate value; no I/O, no logging

### 4.2 Event naming convention

Pattern: `aggregate.action.<namespace>`

Subscriber patterns use wildcards:
- `arrow.added.*` — subscribe to all instances
- `runtime.ended.github.com/user/repo@v1.0.0` — subscribe to one instance

### 4.3 Snapshot policy

A snapshot is a single upserted row keyed by `aggregate_id` (asynx v0.8) — O(1) read, constant storage, not an appended row that every future read must scan past. There is no cost tier to optimize for anymore: `ShouldSnapshot()` returns `true` unconditionally, including on high-frequency commands (`AdvanceStep`, `RecordPID`, `AllocatePort`, `DeallocatePort`).

The reader's own auto-snapshot only fires `if result.DidUpcast` (on warm and cold path alike) — it never writes a snapshot on a plain read. With no upcasters registered and `schemaVersion` at 1, that path never triggers here. The only thing that ever writes a snapshot row is a command whose `ShouldSnapshot()` is `true`.

### 4.4 Aggregate removal

Use `asynx.Forget(aggregateID)` — not a command. Triggers `OnForget` hooks for downstream cleanup.

### 4.5 Validation errors

Wrap `asynxModels.ErrValidation` with context. Never return `ErrValidation` bare.

### 4.6 Aggregate IDs are not unique across aggregate types

Arrow and Runtime commands both return `Namespace.String()` from `AggregateID()`. Their event streams stay separate *only* because each asynx instance (`internal/app/container.go: newAsynx`) has its own db file. Never point two asynx instances at the same store — their streams would interleave into one and corrupt both.

### 4.7 WorkersPerShard must stay above 1

`internal/app/container.go: newAsynx` sets `Shards: 8` and leaves `WorkersPerShard` at the asynx default. Do not drop it to 1: `DELETE /v0/arrow/:ns` → `axArrow.Forget` → the synchronous `OnArrowRemoved` cascade wired in `internal/app/repositories/container.go`, which calls `Graph.RemoveDependencies` and then `Runtime.Forget` — the latter a blocking call into `axRuntime`, which contends with the wizard drain goroutine already running inside `axRuntime` for that same aggregate. Each aggregate gets its own asynx instance and shard pool, so this is a cross-instance circular wait, not two aggregates sharing a shard — restoring more workers only widens the window instead of closing it. The real fix (making the forget-cascade non-blocking, with a boot-time reconcile for cascades that never complete) is not yet implemented. Read the full comment on `newAsynx` before touching this.

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` never runs the `integration` build tag, so this class of bug passes CI silently. Only `make pr-checks` (which runs `test-integration`) catches it — run it before any change to sharding or the forget cascade.

---

## 5. App Layer Patterns

Read `internal/app/` for current code.

### 5.1 Sentinel errors

All app-layer sentinel errors live in `internal/app/errors/errors.go`. The available sentinels are: `ErrNotFound`, `ErrAlreadyExists`, `ErrStateViolation`, `ErrMethodNotFound`, `ErrFetchFailed`, `ErrInvalidNamespace`, `ErrDependentsExist`, `ErrInvalidManifest`, `ErrPlatformNotSupported`, `ErrMissingVariable`.

Always wrap with context: `fmt.Errorf("operation name: %w", apperrors.ErrXxx)`. Never create new sentinel errors in usecases or handlers — add to `errors.go` if a new one is truly needed.

### 5.2 Usecase interface pattern

Each usecase is an exported interface + unexported struct. Constructor is exported and returns the interface. The struct holds only injected dependencies. Example structure (read actual files for current signatures):

```
type FooUsecase interface { ... }
type fooUsecase struct { dep1 ..., dep2 ... }
func NewFooUsecase(dep1, dep2) FooUsecase { return &fooUsecase{...} }
```

### 5.3 Error wrapping

Every call site wraps with context: `fmt.Errorf("operation: dep call %s: %w", ns, err)`. Chain reads outward from the error: `"install: add dep to catalog github.com/u/r@v1: not found"`.

### 5.4 Repository callback wiring

Cross-repository reactions wire in `repositories/container.go` via a `wireCallbacks()` helper. Pattern: `c.Arrow.OnArrowAdded(func(...) { c.Graph.SyncDependencies(...) })`. All wiring errors use the prefix `repositories: wire <EventName>: %w`.

### 5.5 Hub broadcast registration

WebSocket broadcasts are registered in `repositories/container.go → RegisterHubProjections`. Pattern: subscribe to an `OnRuntimeXxx` callback, call `hub.BroadcastXxx(data)` inside. Never call broadcasts from usecases.

### 5.6 Container struct pattern

Each layer (`engine`, `adapter`, `app`, `repositories`, `usecases`) has a `Container` struct with exported fields for sub-components and a `New(...)` constructor that returns `(*Container, error)`. Construction errors use prefix `<layer> container: <component>: %w`.

---

## 6. API Layer Patterns

Read `internal/api/v0/` for current code.

### 6.1 Handlers struct

Each endpoint group has a `Handlers` struct that holds the usecase interface and a `New(svc) *Handlers` constructor. Methods on the struct are the Gin handler functions.

### 6.2 Response helpers

All response writing goes through `internal/api/libs/`:
- `libs.WriteErr(c, status, msg, subject)` — error response
- `libs.WriteMutationOK(c, status, subject)` — write success (201/204)
- `libs.WriteQueryOK(c, data)` — read success (200)
- `apierr.StatusAndMessage(err)` — maps sentinel errors to HTTP codes

### 6.3 HTTP/WebSocket dispatch

The `dispatch(rest, ws gin.HandlerFunc)` helper in routes files checks for the `Upgrade: websocket` header and routes accordingly. One `GET` route can serve both.

### 6.4 Swagger annotations

Every handler function has swagger doc comments. Format: `@Summary`, `@Description`, `@Tags`, `@Param`, `@Success`, `@Failure`, `@Router`. Read any existing handler for the exact format. Running `make build-docs` regenerates `docs/swagger/` — CI fails if it's stale.

### 6.5 API versioning

Each version implements `Prefix() string`, `Register(*gin.RouterGroup)`, and `WSHandler() WSVersion`. New versions are passed to `api.New(...)` variadic — no changes to `api/container.go`.

---

## 7. Repository Internal Layout

```
repositories/<name>/
  <name>.go              ← public interface + constructor
  internal/
    commands/            ← one file per Asynx command
    store/               ← read-model store (GORM)
      internal/
        storage/         ← GORM models + view structs
        projections/     ← Asynx projections → update read model
    upcasters/           ← Asynx event upcasters (schema migration)
    reactions.go         ← internal Asynx subscriptions
    hooks.go             ← public callback hooks (OnXxx)
    recovery.go          ← crash recovery (runtime only)
    mocks/               ← test doubles for this repository
```

---

## 8. Go Coding Patterns

### 8.1 Error handling

- Always wrap: `fmt.Errorf("operation: %w", err)`
- Sentinel errors in `app/errors/errors.go` — check with `errors.Is`
- `isNotFound(err)` helper in repository files compares Asynx not-found by message string
- Never return bare errors from upper layers

### 8.2 Naming conventions

| Element | Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Exported type | PascalCase | `ArrowState`, `TargetLifecycle` |
| Unexported struct | camelCase | `arrowUsecase`, `runtimeRepo` |
| Interface | PascalCase, no I/suffix | `ArrowUsecase`, `WebSocketHub` |
| Domain constants | descriptive PascalCase | `ArrowStateReady`, `MethodInstall` |
| Test functions | `TestType_Method_Desc` | `TestArrowState_IsActive_Running` |
| Package aliases | short camelCase | `apperrors`, `apphub`, `domainRuntime` |

### 8.3 Package aliasing

When two packages would collide on the last path segment or when the last segment is generic, alias to a short camelCase name. Common aliases: `apperrors`, `apphub`, `domainRuntime`, `domainStep`, `repoarrow`, `wizardPkg`.

### 8.4 Context propagation

`context.Context` is always the first parameter of every function that does I/O. Never store context in structs.

### 8.5 Struct construction

- Constructor: `func New(...) (*T, error)` — return nil + error on failure
- No global state mutated after process start
- Small structs: direct literal `return &Foo{field: val}`

### 8.6 Method receivers

- Pointer receiver `*T` when method mutates state or returns errors from struct fields
- Value receiver for pure computations on value types

### 8.7 JSON + YAML tags

All domain structs that cross a serialization boundary need both `yaml` and `json` tags on every field. Steps and other polymorphic types use a private `wire` struct inside `MarshalJSON`/`UnmarshalJSON` to control field naming.

### 8.8 Early returns

Prefer guard clauses over nested ifs. Validate inputs at the top, return errors early, happy path at the bottom.

---

## 9. Test Patterns

### 9.1 Test file naming and package

`<filename>_test.go` in the same directory. Domain tests: same package. API/integration tests: external package (`package foo_test`).

### 9.2 Test function naming

`TestType_Method_Description` — describes the subject, operation, and expected outcome. Examples: `TestArrowState_IsActive_RunningReturnsTrue`, `TestNamespace_Validate_EmptyReturnsError`.

### 9.3 Table-driven tests

Preferred for functions with multiple input/output cases. Variable named `testCases`, type `[]struct{ name string; ... }`. Each case has a `name` string, inputs, expected outputs. Inner `t.Run(tc.name, ...)`. Use `require` for fatal assertions (test can't proceed), `assert` for non-fatal.

### 9.4 Stubs and mocks

Simple struct implementations of interfaces — either inline in the test file or in a `mocks/` subdirectory. The project does NOT use mock-generation tools (mockery, etc.). Write stubs by hand.

### 9.5 TestMain for setup

API/Gin tests use `TestMain` to call `gin.SetMode(gin.TestMode)` before running.

### 9.6 Coverage requirement

**Every new implementation must have ≥ 95% unit test coverage.** Test all branches, all error paths, all state transitions, all edge cases (empty input, nil pointers, boundary values). CI gate is 90% total; per-implementation target is 95%.

---

## 10. Engine Interfaces

Each engine is an interface received through DI. Read the interface definitions in their respective packages for current method signatures. Summary of responsibilities:

| Engine | Package | What it does |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `Manifold` | `engine/manifold` | Fetch + parse + compile arrow/collection manifests from namespaces |
| `Vault` | `engine/vault` | Cache manifests to disk; manage workdirs; TTL sweep |
| `Wizard` | `engine/wizard` | Spawn and supervise processes for lifecycle steps |
| `DepTree` | `engine/deptree` | Topological sort of dependency graphs |
| `Netbridge` | `engine/netbridge` | Allocate/deallocate ephemeral ports |

---

## 11. Manifest Schema (arrow@v0)

The manifest format is described in `docs/` and embedded in the binary via `metadata.yaml`. The top-level keys are `metadata`, `variables`, `netbridge`, and `targets`. Each target key is an OS string (`linux/amd64`, etc.) and contains `requirements`, `tools`, `services`, `exports`, `lifecycle`, and optional `methods`. Check `docs/` for the authoritative schema — it evolves with new manifest versions.

---

## 12. Key Flows

These describe the general call chain for major operations. Read the actual code for current details.

### Add arrow (POST /v0/arrow/:ns)

Handler validates namespace → ArrowUsecase.Add → arrow repository adds: resolves manifest via manifold, caches to vault, sends Asynx command → projection updates read model → reaction syncs dependency graph → hub broadcasts to WS clients.

### Install arrow (POST /v0/runtime/:ns/install)

RuntimeUsecase.Install → dependency graph resolves topological order → for each dep: resolve manifest if missing, register, begin install, wait for completion → begin install on target arrow → reaction starts wizard → wizard spawns process → step advance/PID events flow back → end execution event → arrow marked installed.

### Runtime reaction flow

The runtime repository subscribes to `runtime.begun.*`. On receipt: starts wizard, drains WizardEvent channel in a goroutine, translates events to Asynx commands (StepAdvanced, RecordPID, EndExecution). On successful install: calls arrow.MarkInstalled.

### WebSocket broadcast

Any Asynx projection fires a hub broadcast → Hub fans out to all Subscribers (one per API version's WS handler) → each subscriber writes to connected clients filtered by namespace glob + query params.

---

## 13. File Naming and Package Layout

- One Asynx command per file in `commands/` (e.g., `add.go`, `begin_install.go`)
- Subdirectory `internal/` inside each repository hides implementation details
- Mock interfaces in `mocks/mocks.go` (single file, multiple stubs)
- API DTOs in `api/v0/dto/<name>.go`
- Handler files: `endpoints/<resource>/handlers/handlers.go`
- Routes file: `endpoints/<resource>/routes.go`

---

## 14. Dependencies (key ones)

| Package | Version | Purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `github.com/char2cs/asynx` | v0.8.x | Event sourcing kernel |
| `github.com/gin-gonic/gin` | v1.12.x | HTTP framework |
| `github.com/glebarez/sqlite` | v1.11.x | SQLite (CGo-free) |
| `github.com/gorilla/websocket` | v1.5.x | WebSocket |
| `github.com/stretchr/testify` | v1.11.x | `assert` + `require` |
| `github.com/spf13/cobra` | v1.10.x | CLI |
| `github.com/google/uuid` | v1.6.x | UUIDs |
| `gopkg.in/yaml.v3` | v3.0.x | YAML parsing |
| `gorm.io/gorm` | v1.31.x | ORM for read models |

Read `go.mod` for current versions.

---

## 15. When to Use What — Component Reference

### 15.1 Logging — `log/slog`

`logger.Init` is called once at process start. After that, call `slog` directly — no wrapper. Always use `*Context` variants (`slog.InfoContext`, `slog.WarnContext`, `slog.ErrorContext`) so logs carry the request trace. Key-value pairs as positional args after the message string (`"ns", ns, "err", err`). Only log in background goroutines and fire-and-forget callbacks where the error cannot be returned. Never log in domain types, commands, or `EmitEvent`.

**Do NOT:** create a custom logger struct, use `fmt.Println` / `log.Printf`, use third-party logging libraries.

### 15.2 Config — `internal/core/config`

Call `config.GetAPI()`, `config.GetManifold()`, `config.GetVault()`, `config.GetLogger()`, `config.GetNetbridge()`, `config.GetArrows()` at construction time. The package uses `sync.Once` — first call reads `default.yaml` (embedded) overlaid with `~/.quiver/config.yaml`. Store the resolved value in the struct; don't call `config.GetXxx()` in hot paths.

**Do NOT:** read `~/.quiver/config.yaml` manually, use `os.Getenv` for Quiver-specific config, pass config structs through layers.

### 15.3 Paths — `internal/core/paths`

Call `paths.Events()`, `paths.Store()`, `paths.Namespaces()`, `paths.Logs()` to get directories. Each call runs `os.MkdirAll` with a per-path mutex (safe for concurrent first-time creation). Test-safe variants `paths.EventsAt(homeDir)`, `paths.StoreAt(homeDir)` etc. accept a temp dir.

**Do NOT:** string-concatenate `~/.quiver/...` paths manually, call `os.MkdirAll` directly.

### 15.4 Product identity + platform metadata — `internal/core/metadata`

`metadata.GetVersion()`, `metadata.GetVersionCodename()`, `metadata.GetPlatforms()` (raw URL templates per git host), `metadata.GetVaultPath()`. Platform base URLs for GitHub, GitLab etc. come from `metadata.GetPlatforms()` — never hardcode `raw.githubusercontent.com` or similar.

**Do NOT:** hardcode git platform raw-file URLs.

### 15.5 File + HTTP I/O — `internal/core/fns`

Single API for local files and HTTP/HTTPS. `fns.Read`, `fns.Write`, `fns.Fetch`, `fns.Download`, `fns.DownloadStream`, `fns.MkdirAll`, `fns.Remove`, `fns.Copy`, `fns.Rename`, `fns.List`. Strategy dispatches automatically — file path → local strategy, `http://`/`https://` → remote strategy.

**Do NOT:** use `os.ReadFile`, `os.WriteFile`, or `http.Get` directly.

### 15.6 Manifest resolution — `engine/manifold`

Injected via DI. Use `manifold.ResolveArrow(ctx, ns)` for the full fetch+parse+compile+validate pipeline. Use `manifold.ResolveCollection(ctx, ns)` for collections. Use `manifold.ParseArrow(data)` for seeding from raw bytes. Read the interface in `internal/engine/manifold/` for current method signatures.

**Do NOT:** fetch manifests via `fns` directly, parse YAML manifest structs manually.

### 15.7 Manifest cache + workdirs — `engine/vault`

Injected via DI. Use vault to: store resolved manifests, retrieve cached manifests, allocate workdirs for executions, delete workdirs after uninstall, list cached versions. `vault.Start(ctx)` must be called (done by `engine.Container.Start`). Read the interface in `internal/engine/vault/` for current method signatures.

**Do NOT:** write files to `~/.quiver/vault/` directly, create workdirs manually.

### 15.8 Running steps — `engine/wizard`

Injected via DI. Call from inside the `runtime` repository's reaction goroutine ONLY — never from usecases or handlers. `wizard.Start(ctx, RunRequest)` returns a channel of WizardEvents. Drain the channel: step progress → AdvanceStep command, PID → RecordPID command, outcome → EndExecution command. Read `internal/engine/wizard/` for current types.

**Do NOT:** call wizard from usecases, check process state via `os.FindProcess`.

### 15.9 Dependency graph — `app/repositories/graph`

From usecases, always use the app-layer `graph.Graph` (not `engine/deptree` directly). Methods: `Resolve(ctx, ns)` for topological order, `HasDependents(ctx, ns, exclude)`, `GetDependents(ctx, ns)`, `DiffDeps(current, next)`. Read the interface in `internal/app/repositories/graph/`.

**Do NOT:** call `deptree.DepTree` directly from usecases, implement your own topological sort.

### 15.10 Port allocation — `engine/netbridge`

Called internally by the variable assembler when resolving port variables. You will rarely call this directly. New features needing ports should declare them as `netbridge` entries in the manifest.

### 15.11 Arrow catalog — `app/repositories/arrow`

Injected into usecases. Methods include: `Get`, `Exists`, `List`, `Add` (triggers manifold resolve), `Remove`, `UpdateManifest`, `MarkInstalled`, and event hooks (`OnArrowAdded`, `OnArrowUpdated`, `OnArrowRemoved`, `OnArrowUpgraded`). Read the interface in `internal/app/repositories/arrow/arrow.go`.

**Do NOT:** call `asynx.Send` directly from usecases, read `domain.Arrow` from Asynx directly.

### 15.12 Runtime execution state — `app/repositories/runtime`

Injected into usecases. Methods include: `GetState`, `GetRuntime`, `BeginInstall`, `BeginExecution`, `BeginStop`, `BeginUninstall`, `BeginUpdate`, `MarkOutdated`, `ListenEnded`, and event hooks. Read the interface in `internal/app/repositories/runtime/runtime.go`.

**Do NOT:** check process state via `os.FindProcess`, subscribe to Asynx topics for runtime events from usecases.

### 15.13 WebSocket broadcasts — `app/hub`

Injected into repositories. Fire-and-forget. Three broadcast methods, each accepting a typed event wrapper. `CatalogUpserted` = add/update, `CatalogRemoved` = delete/unfollow. Registered in `repositories/container.go → RegisterHubProjections`.

**Do NOT:** write to WS connections directly from repositories or usecases, call broadcasts from usecases.

### 15.14 Error type → HTTP status — `api/libs/apierr`

`apierr.StatusAndMessage(err)` maps app-layer sentinel errors to HTTP status codes. Always use this — don't hard-code status codes in handlers. Read `internal/api/libs/apierr/` for the current mapping.

### 15.15 Summary table

| Task | Package |
|------|---------|
| Structured logging | `log/slog` (stdlib) |
| Read config values | `internal/core/config` |
| Resolve named directories | `internal/core/paths` |
| Product identity / platform URLs | `internal/core/metadata` |
| File + HTTP I/O | `internal/core/fns` |
| Parse + compile arrow manifest | `internal/engine/manifold` |
| Cache manifest / workdir | `internal/engine/vault` |
| Run lifecycle steps | `internal/engine/wizard` (runtime repo only) |
| Topological dep sort | `internal/app/repositories/graph` |
| Port allocation | `internal/engine/netbridge` (via assembler) |
| Read/write arrow catalog | `internal/app/repositories/arrow` |
| Read/write runtime state | `internal/app/repositories/runtime` |
| Broadcast to WS clients | `internal/app/hub` |
| Error type → HTTP status | `internal/api/libs/apierr` |

## 16. Code Style and Formatting

### 16.1 Formatters (mandatory, enforced by CI)

Two formatters run via `make fmt`:

1. **`gofumpt`** with `extra-rules: true` — stricter than `gofmt`. Enforces blank lines between top-level declarations, grouped blocks, removes unnecessary blank lines inside functions.
2. **`goimports`** with `local-prefixes: github.com/rabbytesoftware/quiver` — groups imports into three blocks: (1) stdlib, (2) third-party, (3) internal. **Never manually re-order imports.** Always run `make fmt`.

### 16.2 Linter rules (golangci-lint)

| Linter | What it enforces |
|--------|-----------------|
| `errcheck` | All error return values must be checked |
| `exhaustive` | Switch on named types must cover all values; `default` does NOT count |
| `funlen` | Max 100 lines / 50 statements per function |
| `gochecknoinits` | `init()` functions are banned |
| `gocyclo` | Cyclomatic complexity ≤ 15 |
| `gosec` | Security patterns (except G404) |
| `nestif` | Nested `if` complexity ≤ 2 |
| `revive/early-return` | Prefer early returns over deep nesting |
| `staticcheck` | Go static analysis |
| `unused` | No unexported unused symbols |
| `whitespace` | No unnecessary blank lines |

Test files are exempt from `funlen`, `gocyclo`, `errcheck`, `gosec`. Suppression: `//nolint:lintername` on the specific line with a comment explaining why.

### 16.3 No `init()` functions

`gochecknoinits` bans `init()`. **Why:** `init()` creates hidden global state causing non-deterministic tests. Use constructors + functional options instead. Every component receives its config through `New(...)`.

### 16.4 No mutable package-level variables

Only allowed at package level: `errors.New(...)` sentinel errors, typed constants, compile-time interface checks (`var _ Interface = (*Impl)(nil)`). Never declare mutable state at package level — it causes test interference.

### 16.5 Functional options pattern

Used to make constructors testable without coupling to the process environment. Pattern: `type Option func(*opts)` + `func WithHomeDir(dir string) Option`. Allows tests to pass a temp dir: `engine.New(ctx, engine.WithHomeDir(t.TempDir()))`. Every layer has its own `Option` type.

### 16.6 Comment style

- Doc comments on exported symbols: single sentence starting with the symbol name, period at end.
- Inline comments: only when WHY is non-obvious. Never explain what the code does.
- No TODO/FIXME in new code. No commented-out code. No "added for X"/"used by Y" annotations.
- English only. No Spanish in source files.

### 16.7 Function length

Hard limits: 100 lines / 50 statements. When over the limit, extract a private helper — do not just add `//nolint:funlen`.

### 16.8 Switch exhaustiveness

`default-signifies-exhaustive: false` — a `default` case does NOT satisfy the `exhaustive` linter. Either cover all cases explicitly, or add `//nolint:exhaustive` with justification.

### 16.9 Error message format

Lowercase first letter, no trailing period, colon-separated context chain: `"outer operation: inner call: leaf error"`. Wrap with `%w` to preserve the sentinel chain. Never expose internal types or stack traces in user-facing errors.

### 16.10 Asynx error mapping

Always map Asynx errors to app-layer sentinels before returning. `asynxModels.ErrValidation` and `ErrPipelineFailed` → `apperrors.ErrStateViolation`. Never let raw Asynx errors propagate to the API layer.

## 17. Makefile Commands

Run from `quiver.core/` root.

### Build

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `make build` | clean + deps + fmt + vet → binary at `bin/quiver` with CGO_ENABLED=0 and version/buildID ldflags |
| `make run` | `go run ./cmd/quiver daemon` — no binary |
| `make clean` | Delete `bin/` and `coverage/` |

### Dependencies

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `make deps` | `go mod download` + verify + tidy |
| `make setup` | `go mod download` + verify + create `bin/` |
| `make install-tools` | Install dev tools: golangci-lint, gofumpt, goimports, swag, asyncapi-cli |

### Quality

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `make fmt` | Run gofumpt then goimports. Run before every commit. |
| `make vet` | `go vet ./...` |
| `make lint` | `golangci-lint run ./...` |
| `make security` | Install + run gosec |

### Testing

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `make test` | All unit tests with race detector |
| `make test-coverage` | Unit tests + write coverage.out + HTML report + per-function stdout |
| `make test-integration` | Integration tests (live system, slower) |
| `make test-all` | Both test and test-integration |
| `make test-docker` | Full suite in golang-alpine container (clean-room check) |
| `make bench` | Integration benchmarks with regression check vs baseline.json (1.25× threshold) |
| `make bench-update` | Regenerate benchmark baseline |

### Coverage helpers

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `make missing-tests` | List source files with no `_test.go` companion |
| `make coverage-files COVERAGE_BELOW=40` | List files with coverage below N% |
| `make coverage-funcs COVERAGE_BELOW=40` | Same, per-function granularity |

### Docs + CI

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `make build-docs` | Regenerate docs/swagger/ + validate asyncapi.yaml |
| `make pr-checks` | Full gate: validate-branch + clean + deps + fmt + vet + lint + security + build + build-docs + test-coverage + test-integration + bench |
| `make validate-branch` | Fail if branch name doesn't match convention |

### asdf + Go tools note

asdf sets `GOBIN` to a version-specific path that differs from `GOPATH/bin`. The Makefile uses `$(go env GOPATH)/bin`. If `make fmt` or `make build` fail with "No such file or directory" for gofumpt or goimports:

```bash
GOBIN=$(go env GOPATH)/bin make install-tools
```

This only affects the current Go version's packages directory. Re-run when switching Go versions.

## 18. Branch Naming and PR Process

### Branch naming

| Prefix | Use for | PR target |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| `feature/<name>` | New functionality | `develop` |
| `enhancement/<name>` | Improvement to existing | `develop` |
| `fix/<name>` | Bug fix | `develop` |
| `refactor/<name>` | Refactor, no behaviour change | `develop` |
| `hotfix/<name>` | Urgent production fix | `master` |
| `release/<name>` | Release cut | `develop` → `master` |
| `dependabot/<name>` | Automated dep bumps | `develop` |

**Format:** `kebab-case` — all lowercase, hyphens only. No camelCase, no underscores, no username prefix.

`make validate-branch` enforces this. CI adds two extra accepted prefixes not in the Makefile: `beta/<version>` (pre-release) and `backport/<name>` (backport).

### PR process

1. Run `make pr-checks` locally before opening the PR
2. Do NOT open as draft — CI skips draft PRs
3. Fill the PR template (Description, Type, Related Issues, Changes, Breaking Changes, Checklist)
4. CI pipeline: `validate-branch` → `code-quality` + `test-coverage` + `build` → `test-multi-platform`
5. **Coverage gate:** 90% total. **Format gate:** any `make fmt` diff fails CI. **Swagger gate:** any `make build-docs` diff fails CI.

## 19. Common Pitfalls

1. Never import a higher layer from a lower one. `domain` imports nothing internal.
2. Never bypass Asynx. State changes must go through commands → `asynx.Send()`.
3. Never put business logic in commands. `Validate` and `EmitEvent` are pure; I/O happens before `asynx.Send()`.
4. Don't use `asynx.Forget` for state transitions — only for permanent removal.
5. Don't create new sentinel errors in usecases/handlers — add to `app/errors/errors.go` only.
6. Always propagate `context.Context` cancellation. Check `ctx.Done()` in blocking selects.
7. Always validate that a namespace has a ref (`ns.Ref() == ""`) before operations that require a versioned namespace.
8. Both `yaml` and `json` tags required on all fields of types that cross serialization boundaries.
9. Test coverage ≥ 95% per new implementation. No exceptions.
10. Error messages: lowercase first letter, no trailing punctuation.
11. No `init()` functions.
12. No mutable package-level variables.
13. Map Asynx errors to app sentinels before returning.
14. Run `make fmt` before every commit. Run `make build-docs` before pushing if any handler or swagger annotation changed.
15. Don't suppress linter warnings without a justification comment.
