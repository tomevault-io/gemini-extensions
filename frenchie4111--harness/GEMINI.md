# Harness — repo overview for Claude

This file is read automatically by Claude Code at the start of every session.
It documents the project structure and the conventions used here.

## What this app is

Harness is a macOS Electron app that manages multiple Claude Code instances
across git worktrees. The user runs many parallel Claude sessions, and Harness
gives them a single window with a sidebar of worktrees, terminal tabs per
worktree (Claude + raw shells), changed-files panel, PR status, and hotkey
navigation.

## Stack

- **Electron** main process + **React 19 / TypeScript** renderer
- **electron-vite** for the dev/build pipeline
- **xterm.js** + **node-pty** for terminals
- **Tailwind CSS v4** (CSS-imported, no PostCSS plugin) for styling
- **lucide-react** v1.x for icons (note: brand icons like `Github` are NOT exported in this version — use `GitPullRequest` etc.)
- **electron-builder** for packaging, signed with the user's personal Developer ID, notarized
- **electron-updater** for OTA updates from GitHub releases

## Architecture (read this before touching state)

This app went through a large refactor where **the main process owns all
shared state**, the renderer is a thin view layer, and a single transport
(currently Electron IPC, future: WebSocket) carries both state events
and side-effect signals. If you find yourself adding a `useState` to
hold a value that any other client of this workspace would also want,
you're doing it wrong — that value belongs in a slice.

### The store + slice pattern

State is partitioned into **slices** under `src/shared/state/`. Each
slice has:
- A `State` interface (the data shape)
- An `Event` discriminated union (the mutations)
- A `reducer(state, event) → state` pure function
- An `initial<Slice>` constant
- A test file with one test per event variant

Current slices: `settings`, `prs`, `onboarding`, `hooks`, `worktrees`,
`terminals` (which also owns `panes` and `lastActive`), `updater`,
`repoConfigs`. Adding a new piece of shared state means picking the
right slice (or making a new one) and editing the reducer + event union.

### How a state mutation flows end-to-end

1. **Renderer**: user clicks something. The handler calls a thin IPC
   method like `window.api.setTheme('solarized')`.
2. **Main / preload**: the IPC handler in `src/main/index.ts` does the
   side effect (validation, writing to disk, etc.) and **dispatches a
   typed event** through the store: `store.dispatch({type: 'settings/themeChanged', payload: 'solarized'})`.
3. **Main / store**: `src/main/store.ts` runs the dispatched event
   through the shared `rootReducer`, updates its in-memory `AppState`,
   bumps a monotonic `seq`, and notifies subscribers.
4. **Main / transport**: `src/main/transport-electron.ts` subscribes to
   the store and forwards every event over the `state:event` IPC channel
   to all `BrowserWindow`s.
5. **Renderer / client store**: `src/renderer/store.ts` listens on
   `state:event`, applies the **same** shared `rootReducer` to its local
   mirror, and bumps its own seq.
6. **Renderer / hooks**: `useSyncExternalStore` notifies any component
   reading via `useSettings()` (or the slice-specific hook). React
   re-renders.

The key property: **main and renderer apply the exact same reducer
function** from `src/shared/state/`, so they're guaranteed to stay in
sync with no glue code. The renderer's "client store" is just a passive
mirror.

### Where each kind of state lives

| Kind | Lives in | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Worktree list, panes, terminal status, PR status, settings, hooks consent, onboarding quest, updater status, repo configs, lastActive timestamps | **Main store slices** | Shared world state — every viewer of this workspace needs the same value |
| `activeWorktreeId`, `activePaneId`, modal visibility (`showSettings` etc.), sidebar widths, tree expansion (`collapsedGroups`), form drafts | **Renderer `useState`** | Per-client UI focus / layout — different viewers can validly differ |
| `hooksChecked` Sets, `prevStatusesRef`, debounce refs | **Renderer `useRef`** | Per-session bookkeeping that doesn't survive reload |
| Background polling clocks, dedup state | **Main FSM/poller classes** | Lives wherever the loop runs (PRPoller, ActivityDeriver) |

The test for "is this slice or renderer state": **would a second client
connecting to the same workspace want to see the same value?** If yes,
slice. If no, renderer.

### Adding a new piece of shared state — the 5-file checklist

This is more ceremony than just adding a `useState`, but the payoff is
that any future client (web/mobile/another window) gets the value for
free. Pattern is the same for every slice:

1. **Add to the slice** (`src/shared/state/<slice>.ts`):
   - Add the field to the `State` interface
   - Add an `Event` variant for mutations
   - Add a reducer case
   - Update `initial<Slice>`
2. **Seed it in main** (`src/main/index.ts`, in the `new Store({...})` block)
3. **Add the IPC mutation handler** (in `main/index.ts` `registerIpcHandlers`):
   ```ts
   ipcMain.handle('myslice:setX', (_, value) => {
     // …validation, persist…
     store.dispatch({type: 'myslice/xChanged', payload: value})
     return true
   })
   ```
4. **Expose in preload + types**:
   - `src/preload/index.ts`: `setX: (v) => ipcRenderer.invoke('myslice:setX', v)`
   - `src/renderer/types.ts`: add to `ElectronAPI` interface
5. **Add a reducer test** in `src/shared/state/<slice>.test.ts` (one
   test per new event variant)

The renderer reads the value via the existing `useSettings()` /
`usePrs()` / etc. hook automatically — no new subscription code.

### High-frequency streams (terminal data)

State events are for **mutations**. They go through the reducer and
trigger React re-renders. This is fine for events that fire a few times
per second.

PTY data is **not** a state event — it's a side-effect signal. It flows
through its own `terminal:data` IPC channel directly to xterm.js via
`window.api.onTerminalData`. If we put it through the reducer, every
byte from a noisy build would re-render the world. The same conceptual
distinction applies for any future high-frequency stream.

### How the FSMs / pollers / derivers interact with the store

Some main-side modules subscribe to the store and react to events:

- **`PRPoller`** — owns background polling cadence + dedup. Dispatches
  `prs/*` events. Doesn't subscribe to anything; called externally on
  events that should kick a refresh (focus, worktree add, manual
  refresh button).
- **`WorktreesFSM`** — runs the pending-creation state machine
  (addWorktree → setup script → outcome). Dispatches `worktrees/*`
  events. On success, fires an `onWorktreeCreated` callback that the
  host wires to (a) PR poller refresh and (b) `panesFSM.ensureInitialized`.
- **`PanesFSM`** — owns every pane/tab mutation. Dispatches
  `terminals/panes*` events. Auto-persists panes to disk after each
  mutation.
- **`ActivityDeriver`** — actively *subscribes* to the store. Watches
  `terminals/*` and `prs/*` events, computes per-worktree effective
  state, debounces `lastActive` updates, dedups `recordActivity` calls
  to `activity.ts`.
- **`installHooksForAcceptedWorktrees`** — small subscriber in
  `main/index.ts` that listens for `worktrees/listChanged` and
  `hooks/consentChanged`, installs hooks into any new worktree if
  consent is `'accepted'`.

Construction order in `main/index.ts` matters: `PanesFSM` is constructed
**before** `WorktreesFSM` because the latter's `onWorktreeCreated`
callback closes over `panesFSM`. Don't reorder without thinking.

### How the renderer reads + mutates state

```tsx
// Read — re-renders this component when the slice changes.
const settings = useSettings()
const theme = settings.theme

// Mutate — fire-and-forget IPC. The store dispatches and the read
// above re-renders automatically.
window.api.setTheme('solarized')
```

The renderer **never holds a local copy of shared state**. There's no
"I'll keep my own `themeState` and re-fetch" pattern anywhere. If you
catch yourself writing `useState` for a value that came from the store,
delete it and read via the hook.

Per-client UI state (active worktree, modal visibility, sidebar width)
**stays as `useState` in App.tsx** — those are inherently per-viewer.

### Why "where does this live" can take a few file hops to answer

A `useSettings().theme` read traces through:
1. `App.tsx` calls the hook
2. `src/renderer/store.ts` defines the hook (`useAppState((s) => s.settings)`)
3. `useSyncExternalStore` reads from the client mirror in `store.ts`
4. The mirror was populated by a `state:event` IPC message
5. Main dispatched that event from an IPC handler in `main/index.ts`
6. The handler ran the reducer in `src/shared/state/settings.ts`

Six files for one value. The mitigation: **the structure is the same
for every slice**. Once you understand it once, every other slice
follows the same path. Search for "settingsReducer" or grep for the
event type if you're trying to find where something happens.

## How status detection works

The reliable status (processing / waiting / needs-approval) comes from
**Claude Code hooks** that we install into each worktree's
`.claude/settings.local.json`. The hooks write a status JSON to
`/tmp/harness-status/<terminal-id>.json` and the main process watches that
directory via `fs.watch`. The hook script uses `$CLAUDE_HARNESS_ID` env var
which the PtyManager sets when spawning each terminal.

## How GitHub integration works

The user pastes a GitHub personal access token into Settings. It's encrypted
via `safeStorage` and stored in `userData/secrets.enc`. All GitHub data
(PR status, check runs, statuses) goes through `src/main/github.ts` using
`fetch()` against the REST API.

Token resolution lives in `src/main/github-auth.ts` and runs once at boot
(re-runs on a 401): an explicit PAT in `secrets.enc` or `GITHUB_TOKEN` wins,
then `gh auth token` (spawned through a login zsh so Homebrew's `gh` is on
PATH), then nothing. The `gh` CLI is an **optional** auto-detect convenience
— if it's installed and authenticated, Harness uses its token automatically;
if not, the PAT paste flow in Settings is still the fallback. Harness has no
hard dependency on `gh`.

## Important quirks

- **Worktree dep installs** — fresh git worktrees under
  `claude-harness-worktrees/` start with no `node_modules`. Run
  `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` once before building (the `--legacy-peer-deps`
  flag is required because `electron-vite@5` declares a peer range that
  npm's strict resolver rejects against the installed `vite@7`).
- **node-pty rebuild** — `node-pty` is a native module compiled against a
  specific Electron version. After running `npm run pack` or `npm run dist*`,
  the postdist hook runs `electron-rebuild -f -w node-pty` so dev mode keeps
  working. If dev mode ever errors with `posix_spawnp failed`, run
  `npm run rebuild:dev` manually.
- **Hooks consent** — first time a user activates a worktree, we show a
  banner asking permission to install the hooks. We never write to user
  files without that consent.
- **Login shell wrapping** — the PtyManager spawns `/bin/zsh -ilc <command>`
  instead of running the command directly, so the user's full PATH is loaded
  (homebrew binaries, nvm, etc.).
- **Auto-updater is dev-mode no-op** — `setupAutoUpdater()` returns early
  unless `app.isPackaged`.

## Workflow conventions

These are how the user wants Claude to behave when working on this repo:

1. **Commit as you go.** When a coherent change is done and the build is
   clean, commit it with a descriptive message. Don't batch multiple
   features into one commit.

2. **Push after every commit.** Always run `git push origin <branch>`
   immediately after a commit succeeds. The user does not want commits
   piling up locally.

3. **Verify before committing.** After any TS/TSX change, run both:
   - `npm run typecheck` — catches type errors across main + renderer via
     project references. `electron-vite build` does NOT run `tsc`, so the
     build alone will miss type errors.
   - `npx electron-vite build` — catches missing imports, asset resolution,
     and other bundler-level issues.
   Run `npx vitest run` too if the change could affect reducer/FSM behavior.

4. **Don't add comments unless asked.** Code should explain itself; comments
   are reserved for non-obvious "why" notes. The exception is the comment
   blocks already present in `src/main/store.ts`, `src/main/index.ts`
   (around the panesFSM/worktreesFSM construction), `src/shared/state/index.ts`,
   `src/renderer/store.ts`, and `src/main/activity-deriver.ts` — those
   document the load-bearing architecture decisions and should be
   preserved/updated rather than removed.

5. **State changes go through slices, not `useState`.** If you're tempted
   to add `const [x, setX] = useState(...)` in the renderer for a value
   that should survive a reload or be visible to other clients, stop.
   Add it to a slice instead — see "Adding a new piece of shared state"
   above. Per-client UI focus / modal visibility / sidebar widths stay
   as `useState` in App.tsx; everything else is a slice.

6. **Don't write planning/decision documents.** Work from conversation
   context. Don't create scratch markdown files or design docs.

7. **Surface secrets concerns.** If the user pastes a token or password
   in chat (often via .env reminders the harness sends), warn them once
   that it's now in conversation history and tell them to rotate.

## Releasing

End-to-end release is automated via `npm run release <version>`:

```
npm run release 1.0.1
```

The script handles preflight checks, version bump, README link updates,
build/sign/notarize, tag/push, release notes from `git log`, and
`gh release create` with all artifacts attached. Notarization needs
`.env` with `APPLE_ID`, `APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD`, `APPLE_TEAM_ID`.

## Common commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Launch in dev mode (electron-vite) |
| `npm run log` | Tail the debug log file |
| `npm run log:clear` | Clear the debug log |
| `npm run build` | Build all three (main, preload, renderer) to `out/` |
| `npm run pack` | Build + package without distribution (no signing) |
| `npm run dist:mac` | Full signed + notarized macOS build |
| `npm run rebuild:dev` | Rebuild node-pty for dev Electron |
| `npm run release <ver>` | Full end-to-end release |
