# Charness - Corca Harness

`charness` is a Claude Code / Codex plugin developed by [Corca](https://github.com/corca-ai).

## Start Here

- [docs/design-north-star.md](./docs/design-north-star.md) governs: brief a
  capable judge and keep teeth only where a wrong answer escapes. At irreversible
  boundaries, confirm through a different observer and evidence channel.
- Load matching skills before improvising, and continue active repo work from [docs/handoff.md](./docs/handoff.md).
- Before changing operating contracts, prompts, skills, exports, or artifacts,
  read [recent lessons](./charness-artifacts/retro/recent-lessons.md).
- Cautilus is eval-only and ask-before-run; use the repo planner/wrapper from
  [cautilus-on-demand.md](./skills/public/quality/references/cautilus-on-demand.md).
- Keep host behavior in adapters/presets/manifests, and prefer executable
  validators plus structured state over prose rituals.

## Skill Routing

At session start, a pickup follows docs/handoff.md `## Workflow Trigger`; ordinary requests use installed skill metadata and model judgment to start the matching workflow directly. When hidden support/integration availability is unclear, run the read-only `charness catalog list --repo-root <repo> --summary` inventory. Treat its facts only as inventory; if the command returns nonzero, report the command failure. If the SessionStart hook is installed it may inject this context; it remains context-only.

External URLs or source links that should become working context for this repo route through `gather` before summarizing, implementing, or deciding from them.

Validation-shaped closeout or operator reading test requests go through `quality` validation recommendations before HITL or same-agent manual review.

Keep this block short. Detailed routing belongs in installed skill metadata and model judgment, not in a long checked-in catalog.

## Subagent Delegation

- Repo-mandated bounded fresh-eye subagent reviews are **already delegated** by this repo contract; this is the repo owner's explicit user delegation request for the named bounded reviewer scopes.
- When the host permits spawning, do not wait for a second user message. Task-completing `setup`, `quality`, `critique`, `release`, and GitHub `issue` resolution/closeout review runs spawn bounded reviewers immediately when the contract calls for them.
- A higher-priority system, developer, or host instruction may prohibit a spawn; this repo request cannot override it. If the host blocks subagent spawning at runtime (Agent tool absent, API-level rejection), stop and report the concrete host signal explicitly.
- Do not substitute a same-agent pass. Fresh-eye review means a different agent context; if that context cannot be obtained, leave the review unproven.
- **Spawn shape, for EVERY spawn — not only fresh-eye reviews.** Spawn one-shot subagents **without** a host addressing or team `name`. On at least one host a `name` silently routes the spawn onto a teammate protocol: the spawn succeeds, the agent runs correctly, and completion emits an idle notification instead of returning the result — findings the parent can never read, because the matching retrieval tool (`SendMessage`) is often not exposed in that session. Reserve a `name` for an agent you will address repeatedly, and only after confirming the retrieval tool exists in this session. A spawned agent is not a received result: an idle notification reads like success and is not one. If findings do not arrive, that is a delivery failure to report and to retry once unnamed, never a subagent that returned nothing and never grounds for a same-agent substitute. Full rule, upstream lineage, and non-claims: [skills/shared/references/fresh-eye-subagent-review.md](./skills/shared/references/fresh-eye-subagent-review.md).
- Bounded reviewers run in the **shared parent worktree**: inspect prior versions read-only (`git show <ref>:<path>`) and never run index- or worktree-mutating git ops (`git checkout`/`restore`/`reset`/`stash`, or `git add` of files touched only to inspect them). Staging a base reversion silently corrupts the closeout commit; the canonical rule lives in [skills/shared/references/fresh-eye-subagent-review.md](./skills/shared/references/fresh-eye-subagent-review.md).
- Bounded reviewers run read-only: on hosts with typed subagents, spawn them as `bounded-reviewer` ([.claude/agents/bounded-reviewer.md](./.claude/agents/bounded-reviewer.md)), and parents prove worktree+index integrity around each review with [skills/shared/scripts/reviewer_boundary_fingerprint.py](./skills/shared/scripts/reviewer_boundary_fingerprint.py) snapshot/verify; a failed verify quarantines that review's approvals.
- **A slice that changes VERDICT LOGIC on a proof surface (a gate, validator, or any code rendering a verdict about other code or artifacts) owes a SECOND bounded review round reading the repaired surface** — one round is not enough for this class: every measured slice shipped a fix carrying the class it fixed, and the round that read the REPAIRS has caught blockers the first round could not see. The trigger is what the surface decides, not that its file was touched, a first round that produced no repairs discharges the obligation, and the cap is two rounds (round-2 repairs are recorded as accepted-unreviewed). Full rule: [docs/conventions/operating-contract.md](./docs/conventions/operating-contract.md) Critique Discipline.
- **Subagent model/effort defaults are per-host, not one global value.** Use the
  host's own subagent controls and its typed agents where they exist
  (`bounded-reviewer` for read-only review scopes), inheriting the session model
  by default; choose a different tier only when the task clearly warrants it. A
  host-specific model or flag request belongs in that host's adapter or preset,
  not here — naming one in this file bakes a model id into the contract and it
  goes stale silently. When a higher-priority policy restricts per-subagent
  controls, proceed and state that limitation.

## Dynamic Workflows

- Dynamic workflow/orchestration use is standing-approved, subject to
  higher-priority system/developer/host instructions and host capability, when
  fan-out, independent confidence, adversarial review, or context scale earns
  its cost. Do not wait for a second user message solely to repeat the standing
  request. Scale to the task, report a concrete host block, and never claim an
  unavailable workflow ran. The canonical root-doc shape lives in
  [agent-docs-policy.md](./skills/public/setup/references/agent-docs-policy.md#dynamic-workflow-standing-request).

## External Boundaries

- Filing an issue is standing-approved. Closing one is standing-approved only
  after the `issue` closeout floor; details live in
  [External Side-Effect Discipline](./docs/conventions/operating-contract.md#external-side-effect-discipline).
- Push, reopen, PR creation, tag, version bump, release publish, and Cautilus
  evaluation each require an explicit phase-scoped grant. Never infer one from a
  green gate.
- A grant is revoked by `--no-verify`, a weakened floor, or narrowed proof.
  Push/release still require distinct-channel hosted/public readback.

## Execution Discipline

- Follow [implementation discipline](./docs/conventions/implementation-discipline.md)
  for `mutate -> sync -> verify -> publish`, generated surfaces, and premise
  checks. Follow the [operating contract](./docs/conventions/operating-contract.md)
  for commits, artifacts, critique, closeout, and session repair.
- Treat task-completing critique, closeout, and commit as work, not follow-up.
  Commit after verification before switching to status/installed-machine checks.
- Do not pipe a gate through `tail`/`head`; redirect to a file and inspect it.
  This repo's `run-quality.sh` retains per-check failures under
  `.charness/quality-failure-logs/` and names recovery in its final receipt.
  Consumer hook configuration follows
  [hook-failure-visibility.md](./skills/public/setup/references/hook-failure-visibility.md).

## Work Routing

- Slow gates, local-vs-CI cost, evaluator-backed validation, and quality-contract
  changes route through `quality` before implementation or HITL.
- Issue/PR close, release, deletion, and proof-surface changes require the
  irreversible-boundary review named by the north star and operating contract.
- Before claiming an issue or operator request closable, map requested outcomes
  to executed proof and run the required fresh-eye critique.
