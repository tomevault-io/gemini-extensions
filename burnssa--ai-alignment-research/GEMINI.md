# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This repository contains experiments and assignments from Harvard CS 2881: AI Safety, which I am auditing to deepen my understanding of AI safety risks and mitigation strategies. The course focuses on:

- **Scalable oversight**: Methods for supervising AI systems that may be more capable than their human overseers
- **Preference learning**: Techniques for learning and encoding human values and preferences
- **Alignment research**: Steering powerful models toward beneficial and harmless behaviors

Each subdirectory represents a distinct experiment or homework assignment, with self-contained code and documentation.

## Reusable Patterns and Utilities

When creating new experiments, consider reusing these patterns from existing work:

### Model Query Interface Pattern (hw0/eval/query_utils.py)

The `ModelQueryInterface` class provides a clean abstraction for:
- Loading local or HuggingFace models with device management
- Applying chat templates consistently
- Generating responses with configurable sampling parameters
- Memory management (GPU cache clearing, 4-bit quantization support)

**Reuse this for**: Any experiment requiring model inference, comparative evaluation, or response generation.

### LLM-as-Judge Evaluation (hw0/eval/judge.py)

Structured evaluation using LLMs to score responses on multiple dimensions:
- Configurable scoring rubrics
- Batch processing of evaluation prompts
- CSV-based input/output for reproducibility
- Baseline comparison support

**Reuse this for**: Experiments requiring qualitative assessment of model outputs, alignment metrics, or comparative studies.

### LoRA Finetuning Pattern (hw0/train.py)

Complete pipeline for parameter-efficient finetuning:
- Chat format preprocessing (converts conversation JSON to model-specific templates)
- PEFT/LoRA configuration with memory-efficient options
- Modular argument parsing for hyperparameter experimentation
- Training configuration persistence

**Reuse this for**: Finetuning experiments, behavioral studies, preference learning tasks.

### Data Format Conventions

Standardize on **JSONL with chat messages** for training data:
```json
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "..."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "..."}]}
```

This format is:
- Compatible with OpenAI chat APIs
- Easily convertible to any instruction-tuning template
- Human-readable and version-controllable

### Evaluation Output Format

Use **CSV with standard fields** for evaluation results:
```
id,question,response,[additional_scoring_columns]
```

This enables:
- Easy comparison across experiments
- Integration with automated grading/CI
- Visualization and statistical analysis

## Creating New Experiments

When starting a new experiment:

1. **Create experiment directory**: `mkdir harvard-cs-2881-[assignment]/`

2. **Copy reusable utilities**: Instead of rewriting from scratch, copy and adapt:
   ```bash
   # Copy model interface if you need inference
   cp harvard-cs-2881-hw0/eval/query_utils.py new-experiment/utils/

   # Copy evaluation framework if using LLM judges
   cp harvard-cs-2881-hw0/eval/judge.py new-experiment/eval/

   # Copy training scaffold if finetuning
   cp harvard-cs-2881-hw0/train.py new-experiment/train.py
   ```

3. **Document experiment specifics**: Create `README_EXPERIMENT.md` with:
   - Experiment goal and research questions
   - Specific commands for this experiment
   - Architecture details unique to this work
   - Results and findings (as you progress)

4. **Maintain separation**: Keep experiments self-contained (dependencies, data, models) to avoid cross-contamination.

## Development Philosophy

- **Favor adaptation over reinvention**: Reuse and modify existing utilities rather than building new ones from scratch
- **Modular experiments**: Each experiment should be runnable independently
- **Reproducible by default**: Use configuration files, random seeds, and clear documentation
- **Safety-focused**: When exploring potentially harmful behaviors (misalignment, adversarial examples), maintain clear boundaries between research code and production systems

## Developer Preferences

- **Text editor**: vim (use this in all documentation examples and guidance)

## Security and API Key Management

**CRITICAL**: This repository uses external APIs (OpenAI, HuggingFace) that require API keys. Follow these practices to prevent accidental exposure:

### Environment Variable Setup

1. **Use .env files** for local development:
   ```bash
   # Copy template at repository root (shared across all experiments)
   cp .env.example .env

   # Edit with vim and add your API keys (never commit this file!)
   vim .env

   # Add these keys:
   # OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here
   # HF_TOKEN=hf_your-token-here
   ```

2. **Automatic loading** in Python scripts:
   ```python
   # Add to top of scripts that need API access
   try:
       from dotenv import load_dotenv
       load_dotenv()
   except ImportError:
       pass  # Fallback to manually set env vars
   ```

3. **Verify setup** before running experiments:
   ```bash
   python check_env.py  # Run from repository root
   ```

### What's Protected (.gitignore)

The repository `.gitignore` protects:
- ✅ `.env` and all variants (`*.env`, `.env.local`, etc.)
- ✅ Credential files (`secrets.json`, `credentials.json`)
- ✅ Model checkpoints (large files)
- ✅ Evaluation outputs (may contain sensitive data)

### Security Checklist

**Before each commit**:
```bash
# Verify no sensitive files are staged
git status

# Check for hardcoded keys (should return nothing)
grep -r "sk-[a-zA-Z0-9]" --include="*.py" --include="*.md" .
grep -r "hf_[a-zA-Z0-9]" --include="*.py" --include="*.md" .

# Verify .env is ignored
git check-ignore .env  # Should output: .env
```

**If you accidentally commit a key**:
1. **Revoke it immediately** at the provider (OpenAI/HuggingFace)
2. Generate a new key
3. Remove from git history before pushing (or contact repo owner)

### Best Practices

- ✅ **DO**: Use `os.getenv("KEY_NAME")` to access keys
- ✅ **DO**: Keep `.env.example` templates (without real keys) for documentation
- ✅ **DO**: Run `check_env.py` to verify setup
- ❌ **DON'T**: Hardcode API keys in Python files
- ❌ **DON'T**: Commit `.env` files
- ❌ **DON'T**: Share keys via email/chat

## Common Development Tasks

### Python Environment Setup
```bash
# Most experiments use PyTorch + Transformers + PEFT
pip install torch transformers peft datasets accelerate bitsandbytes
pip install openai python-dotenv  # For LLM-as-judge evaluation and env management
```

### GPU/Memory Management
```bash
# For memory-constrained environments, use 4-bit quantization
python train.py --use_4bit

# Monitor GPU usage
watch -n 1 nvidia-smi
```

### Quick Model Testing
```bash
# Most experiments include a sandbox.py for interactive testing
python sandbox.py  # Modify paths/prompts as needed
```
