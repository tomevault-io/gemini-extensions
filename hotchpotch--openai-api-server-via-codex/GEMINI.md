# Repository Guidelines

## Project

This repository implements an OpenAI-compatible FastAPI server that forwards
`/v1/responses` and `/v1/chat/completions` requests through the local Codex
HTTP backend credentials.

Keep compatibility behavior aligned with the official `openai-python` client.
When changing request or response shapes, add or update tests that exercise the
client API rather than only raw HTTP payloads.

## Environment

- Use Python 3.10 or newer.
- Use `uv` for dependency management and command execution.
- The default foreground server binds to `127.0.0.1:18080`.
- Do not commit local virtualenv, cache, tox, pytest, or editor artifacts.
- The live integration tests use the machine's existing Codex authentication.
  Do not add real tokens or copied auth files to the repository.

## Development Commands

Run the full local validation suite before committing behavior changes:

```bash
uv run tox
```

GitHub Actions runs the same validation suite for pushes to `main` and for pull
requests through `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

Run focused compatibility tests while iterating on request/response behavior:

```bash
uv run python -m pytest tests/test_openai_compat_server.py -q
uv run ruff check .
uv run ty check
```

Run real Codex backend integration tests only when live network/auth testing is
intended. These tests use the machine's Codex authentication and make real model
requests:

```bash
RUN_CODEX_LIVE_TESTS=1 uv run python -m pytest tests/test_live_integration.py -q -s
RUN_CODEX_LIVE_TESTS=1 uv run python -m pytest tests/test_live_codex_http_compatibility.py -q -s
```

Run the broad Codex HTTP OpenAI client compatibility matrix by itself when
investigating API surface regressions:

```bash
RUN_CODEX_LIVE_TESTS=1 uv run python -m pytest tests/test_live_codex_http_compatibility.py::test_live_codex_http_handles_openai_client_compatibility_matrix -q -s
```

Run the server locally:

```bash
uv run openai-api-server-via-codex
uv run openai-api-server-via-codex --port 18080
uv run openai-api-server-via-codex --verbose
uv run openai-api-server-via-codex --config ~/.config/openai-api-server-via-codex/config.toml
```

Generate a config template:

```bash
uv run openai-api-server-via-codex config-generate
uv run openai-api-server-via-codex config-generate --stdout
```

Validate package artifacts before a PyPI release:

```bash
uv run tox
rm -rf dist
uv build --no-sources
uv run twine check --strict dist/*
uv run --with "$(ls dist/*.whl)" --no-project openai-api-server-via-codex --help
```

Generate release note text from the draft or finalized release notes:

```bash
python scripts/release-notes.py vX.Y.Z
```

## Implementation Notes

- Keep the public API OpenAI-compatible for both sync-style and async-style
  `openai-python` usage.
- Support both non-streaming and `stream=true` flows for Responses and Chat
  Completions.
- Preserve `previous_response_id` behavior by updating the in-memory response
  store when a response completes, including streaming responses.
- Keep stored Chat Completions compatible with the `openai-python`
  `client.chat.completions.list/retrieve/update/delete` and
  `client.chat.completions.messages.list` APIs. Chat `metadata` is stored by
  this compatibility server and should not be forwarded to Codex backends unless
  the backend explicitly supports it.
- Keep Responses helper APIs compatible with the `openai-python`
  `client.responses.retrieve(..., stream=True)`,
  `client.responses.input_tokens.count`, `client.responses.delete`, and
  `client.responses.cancel` call shapes.
- The only backend is `codex-http`. The previous native Codex app-server
  backend was removed because it was unstable; do not keep compatibility paths
  for it unless it is deliberately reimplemented later.
- Normalize Codex HTTP backend requests at the backend boundary: force the
  downstream Codex call to `stream=true` and `store=false`, default text
  verbosity to `low`, default `tool_choice`/`parallel_tool_calls`, include
  `reasoning.encrypted_content`, and add Codex-compatible stream headers.
  Public `store=true` compatibility is handled by local in-memory stores, not
  by forwarding `store=true` to ChatGPT Codex.
- Config is loaded from `--config`, `OPENAI_VIA_CODEX_CONFIG`, or the XDG path
  `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/openai-api-server-via-codex/config.toml`, falling back to
  `~/.config/openai-api-server-via-codex/config.toml`. Setting precedence is
  CLI flag, environment variable, config file, default.
- Daemon PID and log files default under the config directory's `run/`
  subdirectory. `start`, `stop`, and `status` should all resolve the same
  config-backed daemon paths. `stop` and `status` should accept `--verbose`.
  When host is omitted and the exact default PID file is absent, they may
  discover a single PID file for the selected port; if multiple PID files
  match, they must refuse to guess and ask for `--host` or `--pid-file`.
- In-memory compatibility stores are intentionally bounded. Keep
  `max_stored_items` defaulting to 1000 and apply it consistently to
  `ResponseStore` and `ChatCompletionStore`. Evict oldest entries first; `0`
  means no in-memory storage.
- Codex backend request concurrency is intentionally bounded. Keep
  `max_concurrent_requests` defaulting to 10, expose it through CLI/env/config,
  and hold a slot for the full duration of streaming responses. `0` means no
  local concurrency cap.
- Codex backend timeout defaults to 300 seconds. Keep CLI/env/config/default
  fallback paths, config templates, README examples, and tests aligned when
  changing that value.
- README examples should use the current preferred documented model. Keep the
  examples on `gpt-5.5` unless there is a deliberate model guidance change.
  Do not confuse README example models with the server's compatibility default;
  changing `DEFAULT_MODEL` requires tests and config-template updates.
- Keep the package version in `pyproject.toml` and
  `openai_api_server_via_codex/__init__.py` aligned. The GitHub Actions release
  workflow expects release tags like `v0.0.1` to match that version exactly.
- Keep user-visible release notes under `docs/releases/`. Add draft entries to
  `docs/releases/HEAD.md` while developing, move them to
  `docs/releases/vX.Y.Z.md` for a release, and use
  `python scripts/release-notes.py vX.Y.Z` to generate the GitHub Release body.
  Keep `tests/test_release_notes.py` aligned with the release-note file
  selection rules.
- For PyPI releases, prefer Trusted Publishing through
  `.github/workflows/release.yml` and the `pypi` GitHub environment. Do not add
  PyPI tokens to repository secrets unless a deliberate fallback release path is
  being used.
- Keep `.github/workflows/ci.yml` aligned with the local required validation
  command. It should run on pushes to `main`, pull requests, and manual
  dispatch.
- Incoming API key authentication is optional and disabled by default. When
  `--api-key`, `OPENAI_VIA_CODEX_API_KEY`, or `[server].api_key` is configured,
  require `Authorization: Bearer <api_key>` for `/v1/...` routes only; keep
  `/healthz` unauthenticated. Do not forward the incoming API key to Codex.
  When `start` launches `serve`, propagate the API key through the child
  environment, not the child command-line arguments.
- `serve` and `start` perform a Codex auth preflight before binding the HTTP
  port or spawning the daemon. Missing auth files, invalid JSON, wrong
  `auth_mode`, missing access tokens, expired tokens without refresh tokens, or
  refresh failures should fail the command with a redacted stderr message and
  must not start uvicorn or the background daemon.
- `--verbose`, `OPENAI_VIA_CODEX_VERBOSE`, and `[server].verbose` should map to
  debug-level uvicorn logs and be preserved when `start` launches the
  foreground `serve` command in the background. Verbose mode should also emit
  application diagnostics for resolved config/settings, request lifecycle,
  endpoint summaries, model-list fallbacks, and Codex HTTP stream/auth behavior.
  Never log raw auth tokens. Use the shared redaction helpers when logging
  upstream errors, request query strings, or auth-related values.
- For Chat Completions, translate Responses stream events into
  `chat.completion.chunk` events.
- Prefer structured parsing and Pydantic/FastAPI/OpenAI SDK models over ad hoc
  string handling.

## Testing Expectations

- Add focused unit or contract tests under `tests/` for compatibility behavior.
- Add or update redaction tests when changing auth, logging, upstream error
  handling, or request logging code. Raw `access_token`, `refresh_token`,
  `id_token`, bearer tokens, JWTs, and client `api_key` values must not appear
  in logs or compatibility error responses.
- Use fake backends for deterministic tests. Prefer tests that call through
  `AsyncOpenAI` or `OpenAI` instead of raw HTTP so SDK parsing, pagination, and
  stream handling are covered.
- Keep live tests skipped unless `RUN_CODEX_LIVE_TESTS=1` is set.
- Before committing behavior changes, run `uv run tox`.
- For changes that affect real Codex request/response handling, also run the
  live integration test when credentials and network access are available.
- For broad compatibility work, run the Codex HTTP live matrix. It covers
  Responses, Chat Completions, streaming, stored Chat lifecycle, JSON mode,
  structured outputs, tool calling, images, multi-turn context, long plain-text
  conversations, and sync/async OpenAI clients.
- After every live run, manually inspect the `-s` output. Confirm that marker
  strings are preserved, JSON/structured outputs parse to the expected objects,
  tool calls use the expected names and arguments, streaming event sequences end
  in completion events, stored Chat retrieve/list/messages/delete behavior is
  coherent, and outputs are semantically appropriate even when wording differs.
- When a live test failure reveals a real backend difference, update the
  contract to match official `openai-python` behavior and add a deterministic
  fake-backend regression test before relying on the live test alone.

## Git

- Inspect the working tree before staging.
- Do not revert unrelated user changes.
- Do not commit secrets, credentials, auth files, or large generated artifacts.
- Use concise English commit messages that describe the behavior change.
