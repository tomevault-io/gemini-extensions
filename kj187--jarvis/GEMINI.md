# AGENTS.md — Jarvis

You are a developer working on Jarvis, a web frontend for Prometheus
Alertmanager. This file is the **single entry point for every AI agent**
(Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Codex, …) and contains the minimum context
needed for any task. Deep, task-specific references live in `.agents/` —
load them on demand via the [Task Router](#task-router--load-on-demand)
below. Never duplicate content from those files here or elsewhere; reference
it instead.

## What Jarvis Is

Jarvis polls all configured Alertmanager clusters, stores every alert
lifecycle in SQLite or PostgreSQL, keeps the current poll snapshot in an
in-memory store, and pushes updates via WebSocket to the frontend. Users can
view, filter, silence, claim, and comment on alerts.

| Layer | Stack |
|---|---|
| Backend | Go 1.25+ · Echo v4 · module `github.com/kj187/jarvis/backend` |
| Frontend | React 19 · TypeScript (`strict`) · Vite 8 · Zustand v5 · TanStack Query v5 · Tailwind v4 |
| Database | SQLite (`modernc.org/sqlite`) or PostgreSQL (`pgx/v5`) — selected by `JARVIS_DB_DSN` prefix, both pure Go (no CGO) |
| Image | Single container: frontend embedded into the Go binary at build time (`//go:build prod` + `embed.FS`), distroless base |

Repository layout:

- `backend/` — Go backend (`internal/api`, `internal/history`, `internal/alertmanager`, `internal/auth`, `internal/ws`, …)
- `frontend/` — React app (`src/components`, `src/hooks`, `src/lib`, `src/store`, `e2e/`)
- `charts/jarvis/` — Helm chart (+ helm-unittest tests under `tests/`)
- `docs/` — user-facing documentation (not AI context, except `docs/testing-e2e.md` and `docs/scope.md`)
- `scripts/` — E2E runner, mock-OIDC config, manual test-alert/silence fixtures
- `.agents/` — task-specific AI reference files (routed below)
- `Makefile` — canonical entry for dev stack, tests, security scans, fixtures (`make help`)

## Task Router — load on demand

Load the referenced file **before** starting the matching task. Do not guess
details that these files own.

| Task | Load |
|---|---|
| Data model, DB schema, API endpoints, component tree, stores, WS events, auth, config env vars, alert state machine, technology decisions | `.agents/architecture.md` |
| Adding a feature: new endpoint, new component, new WS event, new cluster parameter (TDD checklist) | `.agents/add-feature.md` |
| Judging whether a feature idea fits the project scope (scope gate) | `docs/scope.md` |
| Triaging a GitHub feature-request issue against the scope, drafting a reply | `.agents/scope-triage.md` |
| Writing or running tests, test matrix, test utilities, CI pipeline | `.agents/testing.md` |
| E2E / screenshot stack: Playwright specs, fixtures, auth modes, `compose.e2e.yml` | `docs/testing-e2e.md` |
| Database backends, multi-replica HA (leader election, snapshot distribution, WS fanout, failover), Kubernetes deployment, SQLite → PostgreSQL migration | `docs/persistence.md` |
| Cutting a release — **only when the user explicitly asks** | `.agents/release.md` |
| Security audit, new-code security checklist, security tooling | `.agents/security.md` |
| Debugging surprising behavior — check before re-deriving a known gotcha | `.agents/lessons.md` |

Tool-specific entry points map to the same files (no duplicated content):

- **Claude Code**: `CLAUDE.md` includes this file; `/project:architecture`,
  `/project:add-feature`, `/project:testing`, `/project:release`,
  `/project:security-check`, `/project:scope-triage` include the
  corresponding `.agents/` file.
- **GitHub Copilot**: `.github/copilot-instructions.md` is a symlink to this file.
- **Codex**: reads `AGENTS.md` natively.

## Critical Invariants — NEVER break

1. **Grace Period (`max(60s, 2×JARVIS_POLL_INTERVAL)`)**: Alert seen again
   within the grace period after `resolved` → reopen old event, create **no**
   new one. Prevents ghost-resolve entries on poll misses. Configured on
   `Store` via `SetGracePeriod` (`cmd/jarvis/main.go`, derived from
   `cfg.PollInterval`) so a poll interval ≥ 60s can't make a single missed
   poll permanently split one episode into two — a fixed 60s window could
   never absorb a miss at intervals that long. `Recorder.claimReleaseDelay`
   must in turn exceed the grace period (also derived in `main.go`), or the
   delayed claim-release check could run before a grace-period-eligible
   re-fire has had a chance to reopen the event.
2. **Increment `occurrence_count` only on second firing**: Not on the very
   first occurrence — only when `hadPreviousEvent = true`.
3. **`getEffectiveAlertState`**: Alert `suppressed` + **all** active silences
   covering it (`status.silencedBy` can hold more than one) have ≤15 min
   until expiry → returns `active`. Must consider every covering silence, not
   just the first one found in `silencedBy` — a longer-running second silence
   still keeps the alert suppressed. This logic **only** in
   `lib/alertUtils.ts` — never duplicate.
4. **Filter functions exclusively in `lib/alertUtils.ts`**:
   `getFilterableLabels`, `matchesLabelMatchers`, `safeRegex` — no copy-paste
   into components.
5. **Route order in Echo router**: `/api/v1/alerts/groups` must be registered
   **before** `/api/v1/alerts/:fingerprint/*`, otherwise `groups` is
   interpreted as a fingerprint. General rule: static segments before
   wildcard parameters.
6. **No `console.log` in production code** (not caught by `golangci-lint` —
   check manually).
7. **`cursor: pointer` on all clickable elements** — globally in CSS:
   `a, button, [role="button"] { cursor: pointer }`.
8. **SQLite single writer**: `SetMaxOpenConns(1)` + WAL mode — only for the
   SQLite dialect. PostgreSQL uses a **capped** pool
   (`JARVIS_DB_MAX_OPEN_CONNS`, default 10, MaxIdle = MaxOpen) — never
   unbounded (an unbounded pool exhausted RDS connection slots in
   production, SQLSTATE 53300) and never `SetMaxOpenConns(1)`.
9. **`JARVIS_DB_DSN` never logged raw**: `db.RedactDSN()` must wrap the DSN
   before any log call. Password stays out of logs.
10. **`rebind()` in `history/store.go`**: All SQL queries use `?`
    placeholders — `rebind()` converts them to `$N` for PostgreSQL at call
    time. Never write `$1` literals directly in query strings.
11. **CORS/WS Origin**: No wildcard `*`. `JARVIS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` is used as
    allow-list for both HTTP CORS and the WebSocket upgrade.
12. **Silence-matching semantics must mirror Alertmanager, not UI-filter
    semantics**: whether a silence *would actually match/cover* an alert
    (affected-alerts preview, overlap detection, expired-silence lookup) is
    decided exclusively by `silenceWouldMatchAlert` / `silenceMatchesAlert` in
    `lib/alertUtils.ts` — anchored regex (`anchoredRegex`, `^(?:pattern)$`,
    matching Alertmanager's RE2 compilation), evaluated only against the
    alert's real labels (no `@cluster`/`@receiver`/`receiver` pseudo-labels).
    `matchesLabelMatchers` (substring regex, pseudo-labels, comma-list
    receivers) is a **separate, deliberately lenient** function for the
    filter bar UI only — never use it to decide what a silence covers. Mixing
    the two was the root cause of a preview showing "0 affected alerts" while
    Alertmanager silenced alerts anyway (unanchored `!~` substring match
    disagreeing with AM's anchored one).
13. **Client-facing read endpoints never call Alertmanager synchronously.**
    Reads are served from poll snapshots (`AlertStore`, `SilenceStore`,
    cached member up-state) — only the recorder poll and explicit user
    mutations (silence create/delete) go upstream, so AM load never scales
    with the number of open browser tabs. Breaking this silently (live
    proxying in `getSilences`/`getClusters`) roughly doubled AM CPU in a
    real deployment.
14. **A failed cluster fetch must never trigger resolves.** The last
    successful snapshot of that cluster stays authoritative — for alerts
    (`Recorder.lastGoodAlerts`, `recorder.go`) exactly as for silences
    (`SilenceStore`, "snapshot only on a successful fetch" in `poll()`).
    Letting `applyPollResults`'s prev/curr diff see zero alerts for a
    transiently-failing cluster reads as every one of its alerts resolving:
    phantom `resolved` events, wrong `occurrence_count` increments, and
    premature claim releases on the next re-fire.
15. **History side effects and Alertmanager polling are leader-only on
    PostgreSQL** (multi-replica; see `docs/persistence.md`). Exactly one pod
    — decided by a PostgreSQL advisory lock (`internal/leader`) — polls
    Alertmanager and writes `RecordStatusChange`/`RecordResolvedForCluster`,
    occurrence counts, delayed claim releases, `reconcileStartupResolves`,
    external-silence events, and retention sweeps
    (`history.Recorder.IsLeader()`, `retention.Sweeper.shouldSweep()`).
    Followers still serve reads/API/WS from snapshots the leader persists to
    `poll_snapshots` (`internal/history/recorder_snapshot.go`) — never from
    their own poll, since there isn't one. SQLite has no followers to gate
    against (`StaticElector` is always leader), so this invariant is a
    no-op there, not a different code path.
16. **`RecordStatusChange` stays transactional and, on PostgreSQL,
    advisory-xact-locked per episode.** The read-last → grace-delete →
    insert → count-update sequence runs inside one transaction
    (`Store.withTx`); on PostgreSQL the transaction's first statement is
    `pg_advisory_xact_lock(hashtext(fingerprint || ':' || cluster_name))`,
    serializing concurrent writers for the same episode across pods (SQLite
    needs no such lock — `SetMaxOpenConns(1)` already serializes it).
    Without this, two pods (or two connections during a rolling update)
    racing the same fingerprint could both read the same "last event" before
    either commits and both insert — duplicate event rows.

## Workflow Rules — always follow

1. **TDD**: Write the failing test first. Implementation + tests always in
   the **same commit**.
2. **Type sync**: After any Go model change, mirror the type in
   `frontend/src/types/index.ts` (exact camelCase field names matching the
   JSON tags).
3. **Pre-commit hook** (`.githooks/pre-commit`) runs checks based on staged
   paths: Go tests + golangci-lint incl. gosec (backend), pnpm audit + eslint +
   jscpd (frontend, needs running dev container), helm lint/unittest (charts),
   and a gitleaks secret scan (always). **Never `--no-verify`.**
4. **Frontend checklist**: `cursor: pointer` on all clickable elements · no
   `console.log` · no `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` · import shared utils from
   `lib/alertUtils.ts` (never re-implement in components) · handle loading
   and error states.
5. **Backend**: All outbound HTTP calls use `context.WithTimeout` (default
   10s). Error responses never leak internal details.
6. **Keep the AI context files in sync — part of every change, not optional.**
   These files are navigation aids, not ground truth: **when a file contradicts
   the code, the code wins — verify against the code before building on a
   documented claim, and fix the file immediately.** Whenever a change touches
   something these files document, update the affected file **in the same
   commit** — without being asked. Do not wait for the user to remind you.
   Mapping:

   | You changed … | Update |
   |---|---|
   | Go model, DB schema/migration, API route, WS event, env var, store/state shape, component/hook/lib file, state machine | `.agents/architecture.md` |
   | Test files, test commands, CI workflows, pre-commit hook, Makefile targets | `.agents/testing.md` |
   | Security tooling, checklists, auth/origin behavior | `.agents/security.md` |
   | Feature-workflow conventions (validation rules, type-sync, checklists) | `.agents/add-feature.md` |
   | Release process, workflows in `release.yml`, versioning | `.agents/release.md` |
   | Scope definition, in/out-of-scope boundaries, litmus test | `docs/scope.md` |
   | Issue-triage workflow, reply guidelines | `.agents/scope-triage.md` |
   | Project description, invariants, workflow rules, commit format, repo layout | `AGENTS.md` itself |
   | E2E stack, specs, fixtures, auth modes | `docs/testing-e2e.md` |
   | Database backend behavior, multi-replica HA (leader election, snapshot distribution, WS fanout, failover), Kubernetes HA deployment | `docs/persistence.md` |
   | Hard-won debugging insight or non-obvious gotcha | `.agents/lessons.md` |
   | Who-talks-to-whom topology: upstream calls, stores, WS events, poll flow | `docs/diagrams/*.mmd` + re-render via `make diagrams` |

   A new **critical invariant** discovered during work goes into
   `AGENTS.md → Critical Invariants`. Before finishing any task, ask yourself:
   "would a fresh AI session still find correct information in these files?"
   If not, fix them first.
7. **Done-gate — never report work as complete untested.** Before presenting
   non-documentation work as finished: run the targeted tests for what you
   changed (`go test ./internal/<pkg>/...`; frontend changes additionally
   `pnpm build`). For larger or cross-cutting changes run `make test-all`.
   If a check cannot be run or fails for pre-existing reasons, say so
   explicitly with the command and output — do not claim green.
8. **Releases**: Never trigger a release without an explicit user request.
   Only when the user explicitly asks (e.g. `/release 1.6.0`): load
   `.agents/release.md` and run its flow end-to-end — it is fully
   non-interactive, do not stop for confirmations.
9. **Dependabot** runs every Monday (Go deps, npm/pnpm grouped, GitHub
   Actions). Its PRs run through CI — green CI → merge, no manual
   intervention needed.
10. **`main` is PR-only — always work on a feature branch, with user gates.**
    The GitHub ruleset `protect-main` has no bypass actors: direct pushes to
    `main` are rejected for everyone, including admins. This applies to
    AI-driven changes and the release prep commit alike (`.agents/release.md`).
    The mandatory workflow for **every** code change (bug fix, feature,
    refactor, docs) has three interactive gates — **ask, don't assume**:

    1. **Branch gate — ask before starting new work.** When the user asks for
       a new change, before writing code or committing, ask whether to create
       a feature branch and propose a name (`git switch -c <type>/<slug>`,
       e.g. `feat/silence-templates`, `fix/ws-reconnect`). On yes: start from
       an up-to-date `main` (`git switch main && git pull --ff-only`), then
       create the branch. **Never commit on local `main`.** If you already
       committed on `main` by mistake, recover: create the branch at the
       current commit, then `git reset --hard origin/main` on `main` — the
       commit is preserved on the branch, nothing is lost.
    2. Commit on the branch (`git commit -s`, tests in the same commit; run
       the done-gate checks from rule 7 first).
    3. **PR gate — ask before pushing.** When the user signals the change is
       done and wants to push, ask whether to open a PR directly via `gh`. On
       yes: `git push -u origin <branch>` and `gh pr create --base main`
       with a Conventional Commit title + filled-in body. Report the branch
       name and PR URL to the user.
    4. **Watch the CI pipeline and fix failures directly.** After opening the
       PR, watch its checks (`gh pr checks <pr> --watch --fail-fast`, or
       `gh run watch`). If a check fails: pull the failing job's logs
       (`gh run view --log-failed`), fix the cause on the branch, commit
       (`-s`), push, and re-watch. Repeat until all required checks are green.
    5. **Merge gate — only on explicit user go-ahead.** With green CI, ask
       whether to merge (`required_approving_review_count` is 0, so self-merge
       works). On yes: `gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch`. Never merge on
       the user's behalf without an explicit request.
    6. **Cleanup after merge.** Once the PR is merged: `git switch main`,
       `git pull --ff-only`, and delete the now-merged local branch
       (`git branch -d <branch>`). This leaves the user back on an up-to-date
       `main` with no stale branches, so no unrelated follow-up work lands on
       a merged branch.
11. **Scope gate — check every new feature against `docs/scope.md` before
    building it.** Applies to user-requested and self-proposed features
    alike. If the feature is out of scope or borderline, say so and explain
    why (litmus test + the matching in/out-of-scope bullet) **before writing
    any code** — the user decides whether to proceed anyway. Never silently
    build an out-of-scope feature. Bug fixes, refactorings, and docs need no
    scope check.
12. **Diagrams — Mermaid, containerized, source + render committed together.**
    Where a picture genuinely clarifies (data flow, who-talks-to-whom,
    lifecycles — not trivial structures), add a Mermaid source under
    `docs/diagrams/<name>.mmd` and render it with `make diagrams` (runs
    mermaid-cli in a container, no local tooling) to
    `docs/assets/<name>.svg`. Embed the SVG in the docs. The `.mmd` source
    and the rendered SVG belong in the **same commit** — and when a change
    alters what an existing diagram shows (new upstream call, new store, new
    WS event), update and re-render it in that same commit, like every other
    doc-sync duty in rule 6.

## Commit Format — Conventional Commits

```
feat(<scope>): ...     → MINOR  |  fix(<scope>): ...     → PATCH
security(<scope>): ... → PATCH  |  BREAKING CHANGE: ...  → MAJOR
test(<scope>): ...     → no bump (tests always in same commit as implementation)
refactor / docs / chore → no bump
```

Scopes: `alerts` `silences` `claims` `comments` `ws` `api` `db` `config`
`frontend` `docker`

**DCO**: Every commit must be signed off (`git commit -s`, adds a
`Signed-off-by:` trailer) — enforced by the `DCO` check in CI on every PR.

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Development stack (hot-reload; Podman or Docker)
cp .env.example .env    # configure at least one cluster
make setup              # enable pre-commit hooks (once; = git config core.hooksPath .githooks)
make up                 # = podman compose -f compose.dev.yml up
# Frontend: http://localhost:5173 (Vite HMR) · Backend: http://localhost:8080 (air)

# Fast test feedback (full matrix and E2E commands → .agents/testing.md)
