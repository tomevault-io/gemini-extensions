    - "Use URL state for shareable and bookmarkable UI states"
    - "Leverage React Server Components for data fetching"
    - "Minimize client-side JavaScript"

  urlState:
    usage:
      - "Search parameters and filters"
      - "Pagination state"
      - "Tab selections"
      - "Modal states"
      - "Sort orders"
      - "View preferences"
    
    implementation:
      - "Use nuqs for type-safe URL state management"
      - "Define searchParams types with Zod schemas"
      - "Implement default values for all URL parameters"
      - "Handle URL parameter validation"
    
    benefits:
      - "SEO-friendly state management"
      - "Shareable URLs with complete state"
      - "Reduced client-side JavaScript"
      - "Better caching capabilities"

    patterns:
      - "Use Server Components for data fetching"

  clientState:
    limitations:
      - "Restrict to ephemeral UI state only"
      - "Use React.useState for temporary form state"
      - "Avoid redundant client-side state"
      - "Prefer URL state when possible"
