# Development Guide: meridian-cli

No real users, no real user data. No backwards compatibility needed — completely change the schema to get it right.

## Philosophy

**Meridian-Channel** is a coordination layer for multi-agent systems — not a file system, execution engine, or data warehouse.

### Design Principles

1. **Separate Policy from Mechanism** *(Raymond, Rule of Separation)*: Harness adapters are mechanism (how to launch Claude/Codex/OpenCode). CLI commands are policy (what to do, which model, what output). Policy changes fast; mechanism stays stable. Keep them apart.
2. **Separate Concerns, Justify Boundaries** *(Dijkstra, Separation of Concerns)*: Group by concern — things that change together for the same reason belong together. Draw boundaries where concerns actually change independently. A boundary between things that always change together is ceremony, not structure. God-object symptoms are refactor triggers, but splitting into more types that carry the same data is not the fix — independence is.
3. **Extend Through Seams**: New harness = one adapter file + registration. New package source = one mars config entry. New CLI command = one module. New extension/plugin capability = one explicit seam, not scattered edits through core. If a feature requires editing 10 files, the abstraction is wrong.
4. **Knowledge in Data, Not Code** *(Raymond, Rule of Representation)*: Agent capabilities live in YAML profiles, not procedural code. State lives in JSONL events, not in-memory objects. This keeps the system inspectable and harness-agnostic.
5. **Crash-Only Design** *(Candea & Fox)*: Every write is atomic (tmp+rename). Every read tolerates truncation. There is no "graceful shutdown" — if meridian is killed mid-spawn, the next `meridian status` detects and reports the orphaned state. Recovery IS startup.
6. **Progressive Disclosure** *(clig.dev, Lengstorf)*: `meridian spawn "do the thing"` works with smart defaults. Power users override with `--model`, `--harness`, `--skills`. Don't force all-or-nothing configuration.
7. **Simplest Orchestration That Works** *(Google Cloud AI patterns)*: Stay a thin coordination layer. Centralized spawn-and-report is enough. Don't build complex agent choreography until the simple model breaks. "Simplest" means least total complexity owned — lines maintained, platforms tested, failure modes debugged, contributors onboarded — not fewest imports. A trusted library that deletes a subsystem is a simplification; a hand-rolled reimplementation of the same subsystem is not.
8. **Refactor Early, Change Is Cheap** *(Beck, "make the change easy")*: No external users, no real user data, and no backwards-compatibility constraints mean structural debt costs more than fixing it. LLM-driven implementation lowers the execution cost of change; accumulated context and architecture debt raise the reasoning cost. Prefer early cleanup when it reduces future edit fan-out, clarifies ownership, or makes behavior easier to observe and test.

### Core Principles

1. **Harness-Agnostic**: One CLI, many runtimes. Meridian never assumes Claude, Codex, or any specific harness — adapters bridge the gap.
2. **Files as Authority**: All state is files — project-level under `.meridian/`, user-level under `~/.meridian/` (see `get_user_home()`). No databases, no services, no hidden state. If it's not on disk, it doesn't exist.
3. **Coordination, Not Control**: Meridian provides structure (spawns, sessions, skills, sync) but never dictates how agents do their work.
4. **Observable by Default, Intrusive Only Where Observation Requires It**: Meridian reads harness state rather than driving harness behavior. Where observation needs a mechanism the harness doesn't provide — like capturing output from a TUI that only emits to a TTY — meridian reaches into the boundary with the minimum machinery needed (PTY capture for primary-launch session-ID extraction is the canonical example). Observability requirement, not control lever. Code that looks intrusive should be justified against a specific unobservable-otherwise constraint, and that constraint named in the commit or comment.
5. **Idempotent Operations**: `meridian sync` twice = same result. Re-running after a crash converges to correct state, never doubles side effects.
6. **Windows Is First-Class**: Windows support is a product requirement, not cleanup work. Do not ship path logic, process behavior, filesystem assumptions, or tests that only work on POSIX unless the limitation is explicitly accepted and documented. Design root discovery, env handling, locking, signals, shell invocation, and smoke-test coverage with Windows semantics in mind from the start.
7. **Prefer Cross-Platform Abstractions**: In Rust, default to `std` and mature cross-platform crates over handwritten OS-specific branches. Use direct platform-specific APIs only behind narrow adapter boundaries and only when a cross-platform abstraction is insufficient. A dependency that deletes platform-specific code and test matrix burden is a simplification, not bloat.
8. **No VCS Dependency for Core Functionality**: Meridian must work in plain directories without git. Git metadata (remotes, commit history, worktree structure) may be used as optional hints or heuristics, but core operations — project identity, state resolution, spawn coordination, session tracking — must not require a git repository.

### Architecture

- **State Root**: User-level `~/.meridian/` (via `get_user_home()`) is the primary state root — spawns, sessions, work items. Project-level `.meridian/` holds project identity and package config. Migration toward user-level is intentional and ongoing.
- **Harness Adapters**: `src/meridian/lib/harness/` — per-harness command building, output extraction, materialization. Adding a harness = one adapter file + registration.
- **State Layer**: `src/meridian/lib/state/` — path resolution, spawn store, session store. Atomic writes via tmp+rename, `fcntl.flock` for concurrency.
- **Package Sync**: `meridian mars ...` — package resolution and `.agents/` materialization are delegated to mars.
- **Profiles & Skills**: Agent profiles (YAML markdown) define capabilities, model, and skills. Skills load fresh on launch/resume (survives compaction).

## Dev Workflow

Two orchestrators split the dev lifecycle: **dev-orchestrator** handles interactive design and planning with the user (spawns architects, reviewers, planners), then hands off approved plans to **dev-runner** for autonomous execution (code → test → review → fix loops, no human intervention needed).

Use `meridian spawn` (not `uv run meridian spawn`) to hand off tasks to subagents. `uv run meridian` runs from local source, so other agents editing meridian's own code in the same repo can leave it in a half-written state — use it only for smoke-testing local dev changes. The installed `meridian` binary is stable and isolated from in-progress source edits.

**Model aliases are the interface.** When the user specifies a model name (e.g. `gptmini`, `codex`, `opus`), pass it directly to `-m` as-is — never translate, guess, or expand the alias to an underlying model ID. Meridian resolves aliases at spawn time. If you need to know what an alias maps to, run `meridian mars models list` first. Do not invent model identifiers.

**Use cheap models for trivial spawn/model smoke tests.** When testing harness plumbing, alias resolution, or spawn mechanics with a throwaway prompt (e.g. `Reply with exactly OK`), reach for `haiku`, `gpt-5.4-mini`, or a cheap OpenCode model. Reserve expensive models (Claude Sonnet/Opus, GPT-5) for tasks that need their reasoning.

NEVER REVERT CHANGES — always assume it's someone else's work.

## Git Hooks

Run `scripts/setup-hooks.sh` (or `scripts/setup-hooks.ps1` on Windows) once after cloning.
This sets `core.hooksPath = .githooks`; Git cannot auto-install hooks on clone.
See `DEVELOPMENT.md` for the human-facing setup and release workflow.

Hook policy:
- Pre-commit is not installed by default; optional fast ruff helper lives at `.githooks/optional/pre-commit` for humans who opt in locally.
- Pre-push is strict: full `scripts/preflight.sh` plus direct `v*` tag push guard.
- Release tags must go through `scripts/release.sh`, not manual tag pushes.

**NEVER use `--no-verify` on git push unless explicitly instructed by the user.**

**NEVER manually create or push git tags matching `v*`.** Use `scripts/release.sh` for all releases.

### Release workflow

```bash
# Stable release: prepare, wait for CI, then resume
scripts/release.sh prepare patch --push        # runs checks, bumps, commits, pushes branch, waits for CI, tags

# If CI fails — fix forward, then resume manually:
scripts/release.sh resume --push

# RC release (no CI gate):
scripts/release.sh prepare rc --push

# Check state / abandon:
scripts/release.sh status
scripts/release.sh abort
```

### Logging Convention

Catalog/config modules (`meridian.lib.catalog.*`, `meridian.lib.config.*`) use stdlib `logging.getLogger(__name__)`. Ops/launch/harness modules (`meridian.lib.ops.*`, `meridian.lib.launch.*`, `meridian.lib.harness.*`) use `structlog.get_logger()`. Split matters: launch diagnostic boundary (`capture_library_diagnostics()` in `diagnostics.py`) captures stdlib warnings during spawn/launch; structlog bypasses it, so catalog/config structlog warnings leak to stderr.

### Editing Agents & Skills

**NEVER edit `.agents/` directly** — it is generated output, overwritten by `meridian mars sync`. Edit the source package repos directly in sibling checkouts. Preferred local layout:

- `../meridian-cli` (this repo)
- `../meridian-web` — general-purpose agent frontend (Apache-2.0). Makefile `frontend` target expects this at `$MERIDIAN_WEB` (default `../meridian-web`).
- `../prompts/meridian-base`
- `../prompts/meridian-dev-workflow`
- `../mars-agents`

Source repos:

- **`meridian-flow/meridian-base`** — core agents, skills, and spawn infrastructure (e.g. `meridian-spawn`, `meridian-subagent`)
- **`meridian-flow/meridian-dev-workflow`** — dev orchestration agents and skills (e.g. `dev-orchestrator`, `reviewer`, `coder`, `agent-staffing`)

When writing or editing agent profiles and skills, follow the prompt and skill design guidance in the source repo at `skills/agent-creator/SKILL.md` and `skills/skill-creator/SKILL.md`, plus their `resources/anti-patterns.md` references.

Canonical workflow:

1. Edit in the standalone source repo (for example `../prompts/meridian-base/skills/meridian-spawn/SKILL.md`)
2. Commit and push the source repo change
3. Update package refs in this repo if needed with `meridian mars add ...`
4. Run `meridian mars sync` to regenerate `.agents/`

### Upgrading from Legacy Sources State

Legacy meridian-managed source files are no longer used and are safe to delete:

- `.meridian/agents.toml`
- `.meridian/agents.local.toml`
- `.meridian/agents.lock`
- `.meridian/cache/agents/`

### Approval Modes

Spawns support 4 approval modes: `default` (harness decides), `confirm` (user approves each tool call), `auto` (auto-approve safe operations), `yolo` (approve everything). Set via `--approval` flag or profile YAML.

### Config Precedence

CLI flags > ENV vars > YAML profile > Project config > User config > harness default.

This applies to **every resolved field independently** — model, harness, approval, timeout, skills. Derived fields inherit the precedence level of their source: if the user overrides the model with `-m`, the harness must be derived from the overridden model, not from the profile's harness. A profile-level value must never win over a CLI override, even indirectly.

### Testing

**Prefer smoke tests over unit tests.** Too many unit tests is bad when you're constantly refactoring.

- **Platform coverage is required**: When a change touches paths, process launching, signals, shells, filesystem semantics, locking, or config discovery, explicitly consider Windows behavior up front. Prefer cross-platform libraries and crates over platform-specific implementations. Add or update tests so the intended behavior is clear on Windows, not merely inferred from POSIX-only coverage.
- **Smoke tests** (`tests/smoke/`): Organized markdown guides for manually testing CLI behavior. Prefer the project-specific scenarios in `tests/smoke/` as the source of truth for what to verify. Run `uv run meridian` to test the CLI in its current state.
- **Unit tests** (focused): Only for logic that's hard to smoke test — signals, concurrency, security/env sanitization, sync engine algorithms, parsing edge cases. Run with `uv run pytest-llm`.
- **Linting**: `uv run ruff check .`
- **Type checking**: `uv run pyright` (must be 0 errors)

```bash
uv sync --extra dev      # Install from source
uv run ruff check .      # Lint
uv run pytest-llm        # Unit tests (token-efficient output)
uv run pyright            # Type check
uv run meridian           # Smoke test the CLI directly
uv add <package>          # Add a dependency (never use pip install)
```

### Local Dev Services (portless)

Install [portless](https://github.com/vercel-labs/portless) globally (`npm install -g portless`) and run `portless trust` once to trust the local CA. Dev services run through portless via Makefile targets — agents and humans use the same commands:

```bash
make backend                # https://api.meridian.localhost
make frontend               # https://app.meridian.localhost
make backend-share          # share over Tailscale
```

In a git worktree, URLs auto-prefix with the branch name (e.g. `https://new-ui.api.meridian.localhost`), so multiple worktrees run the full stack simultaneously without port collisions. Never run services with raw port numbers during dev — always use the Makefile targets.

### Versioning

The package version lives in `src/meridian/__init__.py` as `__version__`. Use the release helper for normal cuts. Short release guide: `docs/releasing.md`.

Prefer `patch` by default, especially while the project is still on `0.0.x`.
Omit `minor` and `major` in normal release flow. Use an explicit version only when the user explicitly asks for a larger version jump.

Usually just bump patch:

```bash
scripts/release.sh patch          # 0.0.2 → 0.0.3 (pushes, waits for CI, then tags)
scripts/release.sh rc             # 0.0.3 → 0.0.4-rc.1 (no CI gate)
scripts/release.sh 0.2.0          # explicit version
scripts/release.sh patch --skip-ci  # bypass CI gate for stable release
```

Stable releases push the commit first, wait for GitHub CI to pass, then tag. RCs tag immediately without a CI gate. Use `--skip-ci` to bypass the gate when needed.

### Releasing Prompt Packages

Prompt packages (meridian-base, meridian-dev-workflow, meridian-prompter) use `meridian mars version` to release. It bumps `mars.toml`, promotes CHANGELOG.md `[Unreleased]` → `[X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD`, commits, and tags in one step.

```bash
# From the prompt repo root:
meridian mars version patch              # bump, commit, tag locally
meridian mars version patch --push       # bump, commit, tag, push to origin
meridian mars version minor --push       # minor bump when scope warrants it
```

Update CHANGELOG.md entries under `[Unreleased]` as you work — `meridian mars version` promotes them automatically. If `[Unreleased]` is empty, it warns but proceeds.

### Releasing mars-agents and meridian-cli

Both repos use their own `scripts/release.sh`. Do not use `meridian mars version` for these — that's for prompt packages only. Stable releases are CI-gated (push → wait for green → tag); RCs are not.

```bash
scripts/release.sh patch          # stable: push, CI gate, tag
scripts/release.sh rc             # RC: commit + tag, no CI gate
scripts/release.sh rc --push      # RC: commit + tag + push
```

### Changelogs

All repos maintain a `CHANGELOG.md` at their root. Format is [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), written in **caveman style** — terse, fragment-friendly, filler-free. Technical terms, agent names, file paths, and code blocks stay exact; only prose fluff gets compressed.

Write entries at commit time in an `[Unreleased]` section, not retroactively — reasoning flattens the longer you wait. Proactively update this CHANGELOG. Entry style: focus on behavioral changes downstream users will notice. For agent/skill repos the "API" is the prompt shape, so describe what agents now do differently, not which lines moved.

Standard shape at any tagged commit:

```markdown
# Changelog

Caveman style. Format: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). Versioning: [SemVer](https://semver.org/). Versions before X.Y.Z in git history only.

## [Unreleased]

## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD
### Added
### Changed
### Removed
```

### Always Use `uv`

This project uses `uv` exclusively for Python tooling. Never use `pip`, `pip install`, `python`, or `python -m` directly. Use `uv run`, `uv add`, and `uv sync` instead.

### Commit Checkpoints

Commit after each step that passes tests. Don't accumulate changes across multiple steps.

1. Implement the step
2. Verify tests pass
3. Commit with a descriptive message
4. Move to the next step

### Never Delete Untracked Files

**NEVER delete or remove untracked files without asking the user first.** Untracked files may be someone else's in-progress work.

1. Ask before deleting
2. If you must proceed, `git stash --include-untracked` first
3. When reverting agent changes, distinguish agent-created files from pre-existing untracked files

### Quality Issue Triage

To see current quality/immediate burn-down work on GitHub, use:

```bash
scripts/quality-issues.sh
```

Lists open issues on `meridian-flow/meridian-cli`, excludes issues labelled `future`, and groups by `quality:high`, `quality:medium`, `quality:low`, then unprioritized. Mars capability packaging issues appear here by default — they are not future work unless explicitly labelled `future`.

## Related Repos

- **meridian-web** (`../meridian-web/`): General-purpose agent frontend. React 19 + Vite + TypeScript + shadcn/ui + Zustand. Apache-2.0. Run with `make dev` (starts both backend and frontend) or `make frontend` (frontend only). Override path with `MERIDIAN_WEB` env var or `.env` file.
- **mars-agents** (`../mars-agents/`): Standalone agent package manager for `.agents/`. Rust CLI, binary name `mars`. Meridian invokes it via `meridian mars ...` for project package setup and sync. Repo: `meridian-flow/mars-agents`.

### Cross-Platform Paths

Meridian has centralized cross-platform path handling. **Do not write new platform-detection code** — use the existing primitives:

- **`src/meridian/lib/platform/__init__.py`**: `IS_WINDOWS`, `get_home_path()`
- **`src/meridian/lib/state/user_paths.py`**: `get_user_home()`

User state root resolution:
1. `MERIDIAN_HOME` env var (if set)
2. Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\meridian`
3. Windows fallback: `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\meridian`
4. POSIX fallback: `~/.meridian`

When adding features that need user-level storage (git clones, cache, etc.), put them under `get_user_home()`:

```python
from meridian.lib.state.user_paths import get_user_home

repos_dir = get_user_home() / "git"  # Cross-platform correct
```

Do not hardcode `~/.meridian/` or introduce new `LOCALAPPDATA` / `XDG_DATA_HOME` branches.
