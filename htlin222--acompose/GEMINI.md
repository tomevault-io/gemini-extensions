# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

acompose runs an existing `docker-compose.yml` on Apple's `container` CLI (the macOS-native, VM-per-container runtime, which ships with no Compose support). It is a single Go binary; all sources live in `src/`: `main.go` (CLI + orchestration), `ui.go` (the `acompose ui` live dashboard), `main_test.go` (unit tests). `src/prototype/acompose.py` is a superseded Python prototype kept for history — don't extend it.

## Commands

```sh
go build -o acompose ./src  # build (or: make build)
make darwin                 # release-style darwin/arm64 binary
make fmt                    # gofmt -w src (CI fails on unformatted code)
make vet                    # go vet
make test                   # go test ./src (pure unit tests, no `container` exec)
make dryrun                 # build + run `acompose up --dry-run` against examples/
make check                  # fmt + vet + test + dryrun
```

Unit tests cover the pure helpers (toposort, extractIPv4, runCmd/buildCmd construction, volName). The integration test lives in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: it runs `acompose up --dry-run` and `down --dry-run` in `examples/` and asserts on the printed `container` commands (start order, env interpolation, `--publish` flags, build translation, loud warnings, reverse teardown order). If you change command construction or output text, update those assertions.

Real (non-dry-run) execution requires macOS 26 + Apple's `container` CLI on Apple Silicon, but `--dry-run` works anywhere — that's the primary development loop.

## Architecture

The pipeline in `cmdUp` (src/main.go):

1. **Parse** — all compose-spec handling (interpolation, `.env`, `env_file`, overrides, profiles) is delegated to the official `compose-spec/compose-go` library via `loadProject`. Never hand-parse compose semantics.
2. **Order** — `toposort` walks `depends_on` (cycles are fatal; names sorted for deterministic order).
3. **Warn** — `warnUnsupported` is the catalog of platform gaps (exec healthchecks, `deploy:`, `entrypoint:`, `user:`, x86 images; `restart:` points at `acompose watch`). Design rule: anything the platform can't honour must be warned about loudly, never silently dropped.
4. **Translate & run** — every `container` subcommand is constructed in one place: `ctr` / `buildCmd` / `runCmd` / `hostsInjectCmd` near the top of src/main.go. The `container` CLI is young and renames flags between releases; keeping construction centralized makes that a one-line fix. Don't scatter `exec.Command("container", ...)` elsewhere (the UI's read-only polling in ui.go is the lone exception). Named volumes are real: `container volume create` before start, `--volume <name>:<target>` mounts, deletion on `down -v` (`volName`/`namedVolumes`; compose-go pre-fills `VolumeConfig.Name` as `<project>_<key>`).
5. **Wire networking** — each container's real IP (from `container inspect`, parsed by `extractIPv4` — a key-aware walk that skips `gateway`/`dns` keys and prefers `address` keys, because the JSON schema shifts and the first IPv4 found may be the gateway) is written into every peer's `/etc/hosts` immediately and bidirectionally, so `db:5432` works in unmodified apps. `<SERVICE>_HOST` env vars are always injected as the fallback for shell-less or non-root images. `condition: service_healthy` is approximated by TCP-polling the dependency's first published port (`waitTCP`). After starting, `cmdUp` verifies actual container state via `container ls --all` and reports per-service running/stopped in the summary.

Beyond up/down:

- `cmdWatch` — supervisor loop honouring `restart:` policies (the runtime has none): polls, `container start`s exited services, and calls `rewireAll` (shared with `cmdRefresh`) to clean stale /etc/hosts entries and re-inject fresh IPs. Refuses `--dry-run`.
- `cmdUpdate` — pulls images and recreates only services whose manifest digest moved (`imageDigests` extracts only `"digest":` keys — matching every sha256 would catch layer blobs and false-positive after `run`'s shallower implicit pull); `build:` services are rebuilt. Ends with `rewireAll` when anything changed.
- `acompose refresh` re-reads IPs and rewrites hosts entries after sleep/wake. `cmdDown` tears down in reverse topological order. `stats` is a passthrough to `container stats` with project cnames.
- src/check.go — `acompose check`: no-runtime compatibility report. `analyzeService` is the single source of truth for platform-gap findings; `warnUnsupported` (main.go) is a thin renderer over it — change classifications there, never in two places. Exit 1 on blockers.
- src/doctor.go — `acompose doctor`: environment readiness; pure verdict functions + injectable `doctorEnv` for hermetic tests; dispatched before loadProject (works with no compose file). `testedContainerVersion` const is the compat-matrix anchor.
- src/dns.go — `acompose dns setup|status|teardown` wraps `container system dns` (needs sudo once; on permission failure prints the exact sudo command). cmdUp prints a dim `host DNS:` line when the project domain exists (probe skipped in dry-run). What resolves is `<container-name>.<project>`.
- src/importvol.go — `acompose import-volumes`: streams docker→container volume data (`runPipeline` uses an os.Pipe for dst stdin to avoid Wait-deadlocks); refuses non-empty targets; docker-side calls are the one justified exec.Command bypass of runner.
- src/dev.go — `acompose dev`: compose `develop.watch` (sync/rebuild/restart/sync+restart) with a polling scanner (no fsnotify dep). Built-in ignores (.git etc.) match by exact path segment; user ignore patterns are substring/glob. Pure core (scanTree/diffScans/planActions) + thin loop.
- `deploy.resources.limits` → `--cpus`/`--memory` in runCmd. CPUs are WHOLE only (verified live: the runtime rejects fractions) — `formatCPUs` rounds up, never down; memory rounds up to MiB.
- Exit-code convention across all subcommands: 0 ok, 1 problems, 2 usage/refusal (incl. all dry-run refusals: watch/dev/dns).

**Dry-run is a first-class mode**: `runner{dry: true}` prints each command instead of executing, and `getIP` returns `<name-ip>` placeholders. Any new execution path must go through `runner.run` so dry-run and the CI assertions keep working.

**UI** (src/ui.go): same binary, serves an embedded offline dashboard at `127.0.0.1:4242` with `/api/state`, `/api/logs`, `/api/action`. It polls `container ls --all` once per state collection and uses tolerant text matching rather than depending on the unstable `ls` JSON schema. The control endpoint is CSRF/DNS-rebinding guarded (`guardStateChanging`: JSON content-type + loopback Host); non-loopback binds are warned. `published` ports are escaped in the dashboard JS (compose long-syntax `published:` is a free string → XSS vector).

**TUI** (src/tui.go): `acompose top` (alias `tui`) — a Bubble Tea dashboard. The model's data access is injected (`fetchState`/`fetchLogs`/`doAction` fields, defaulting to `collectState`/`container logs` tail/`ensureServiceRunning`+`container stop`) so `Update` is a pure reducer testable with synthetic `tea.KeyMsg` — no TTY needed. `cmdTop` guards `!isTTY` (degrades to a hint in pipes). This is the project's only third-party dependency tree (charmbracelet/*, pure Go — CGO stays off); go.mod pins `toolchain go1.26.4` so govulncheck passes on patched stdlib.

## Conventions

- User-facing output goes through `info`/`okay`/`warn`/`fail` (colors auto-disable when not a TTY). `warn`/`fail` write to stderr — CI asserts warnings on stderr separately from stdout.
- Map iteration is always sorted before generating commands so output is deterministic (CI greps depend on it).
- Releases: push a `v*` tag → goreleaser workflow builds multi-platform binaries (`main: ./src` in .goreleaser.yaml).
- Landing site: `site/index.html` (single static file, no build step) auto-deploys to https://acompose.pages.dev via `.github/workflows/pages.yml` on pushes touching `site/**` (Cloudflare Pages project `acompose`; secrets `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`/`CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`). Note: the user's global gitignore excludes `*.html` — the repo `.gitignore` negates it for `site/`.
