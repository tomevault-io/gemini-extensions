# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

WinZapp is a free, self-hosted Windows desktop WhatsApp client built specifically for **accessibility** (blind/low-vision users via NVDA/JAWS/Narrator through `accessible_output2`). It's a hybrid app: a Python 3.13 + wxPython GUI process drives a locally-run **WPPConnect Server** (Node.js, cloned/built from the upstream `wppconnect-team/wppconnect-server` repo) that acts as the actual WhatsApp Web gateway. The two processes talk over local HTTP REST (`http://127.0.0.1:6300/api/...`) and Socket.IO (real-time events).

## Commands

### Dev setup
```powershell
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt   # adds pytest, pytest-cov, pytest-asyncio
python setup_api.py                   # clones + builds client/api/ (WPPConnect Server) — one-time, requires Node
```
`setup_api.py` clones WPPConnect Server into `client/api/`, restores WinZapp's custom patched files (`start.js`, `config.json`, plus `src/config.ts`, `src/index.ts`, `src/util/{createSessionUtil,sessionUtil,functions}.ts`, `src/middleware/statusConnection.ts`, `src/controller/{deviceController,messageController,sessionController,statusController}.ts`, `src/routes/index.ts`, `decrypt.js` — the full, current list is `CUSTOM_ROOT_FILES + CUSTOM_SRC_FILES` at the top of the script), then runs `npm install` and `npm run build` inside `client/api/`. `package.json` is handled separately by `_merge_package_json_dependencies()` (overrides only WinZapp's specific dependency entries, not a full-file restore — see that function's own docstring for why). Re-run it any time `client/api/` needs to be rebuilt — it preserves `node_modules` and the custom files across re-clones. `build.py` also auto-detects when `client/api/` has drifted from `client/api_patches/` (a patch edited but this script never re-run) and re-runs it automatically before compiling — see the Packaging section below.

### Run the client in dev mode
```powershell
cd client
python main.py
```
Entry point is `client/main.py`, guarded by `if __name__ == "__main__":` near the bottom of the file. There is no separate "start the API server" dev command — `main.py` launches/manages the local Node WPPConnect Server process itself.

### Tests
```powershell
pytest                                   # from repo root; pytest.ini sets pythonpath=client, asyncio_mode=auto
pytest tests/test_database.py            # single file
pytest tests/test_database.py::TestChats::test_upsert_chat_creates_record  # single test
```
Tests cover `client/core/database.py` and `client/core/database_bridge.py` (async SQLite layer + its sync façade) and small islands of pure logic pulled out of `main.py`/`core/notification_manager.py`/`ui/conversations.py` (e.g. `tests/test_sender_names.py`, `tests/test_notifications.py`, `tests/test_delivery_status.py`, `tests/test_send_jid_resolution.py`, `tests/test_message_bookmarks.py`) by binding their unbound methods onto a plain stub object — `MainWindow`/`ConversationsPanel` are wx.Frame/wx.Panel and can't be instantiated without a running wx.App, so the stub carries only the attributes the method under test actually touches. There are no tests for the wx UI in bulk. Async tests use `pytest-asyncio` in `auto` mode — no `@pytest.mark.asyncio` decorator needed, just declare test functions `async def`. **New functions/features should come with a test in this style as part of the same change.**

### Building the distributable
```powershell
venv\Scripts\python.exe build.py             # onedir: WinZappInstaller.exe + WinZapp.zip
venv\Scripts\python.exe build.py --onefile   # single-file WinZapp.exe + WinZapp.zip
```
Requires, in addition to the venv: `client/node/` (portable Windows x64 Node.js extracted there), `client/api/dist/server.js` built (via `setup_api.py`), and — for `--onedir` only — `gcc`/`windres` in `PATH` (MSYS2 UCRT64) to compile the C installer/uninstaller stubs in `installer/`. `client/api/` and `client/node/` are git-ignored and must be prepared locally before building; see `.github/workflows/release.yml` for the exact CI sequence if reproducing a release build. `check_tools()` (step 1) also diffs every patched file in `client/api_patches/` against its live copy in `client/api/` and, on drift, re-runs `setup_api.py` automatically before continuing — a patch edited only in `client/api_patches/` without rebuilding used to ship a stale/reverted `dist/server.js` with no warning.

## Architecture

### Two-process split
- **`client/` (Python/wxPython)** — all UI, business logic, local persistence, notifications, sounds. This is what you'll be editing almost all of the time.
- **`client/api/` (Node/TypeScript, vendored via `setup_api.py`, not committed)** — WPPConnect Server, a Puppeteer-driven WhatsApp Web automation server. WinZapp keeps a small set of patched files on top of upstream (`start.js`, `config.json`, several `src/**/*.ts` controllers/middleware/util files — see the Dev setup section above for the current list) tracked permanently in `client/api_patches/` — `setup_api.py` (and `build.py`, on detected drift) re-applies these after every clone/checkout. Treat `client/api/` itself as mostly third-party; only ever edit the tracked copy under `client/api_patches/`, then re-run `setup_api.py` (or let `build.py` do it) to propagate the change into `client/api/`.
- **node_modules patches**: two files patch `@wppconnect-team/wppconnect`'s own *compiled* `node_modules` output (not WPPConnect Server's own source, so they can't go through the `client/api_patches/` mechanism above) — `client/core/wppconnect_host_layer_patch.py` (pairing-code rotation cooldown, `host.layer.js`) and `client/core/wppconnect_status_layer_patch.py` (status-post success/failure reporting, `status.layer.js`). Both hold the patch source text as shared constants, applied via idempotent search-and-replace from two independent call sites that must stay in sync: `setup_api.py` (dev/CI) and `ApiSetupDialog._apply_node_modules_patches()` (`client/ui/dialogs/api_setup.py`, the real end-user install flow, since `npm install` on an end user's machine re-fetches unpatched `node_modules` fresh). This is the established pattern for any future bug that requires patching third-party JS inside `node_modules` rather than WPPConnect Server's own source.
- `client/api2/` is a small standalone Puppeteer/Chrome auto-install helper script, unrelated to the main WPPConnect flow above.

### `client/main.py` — the god object
Almost everything (WebSocket/HTTP calls to WPPConnect, JID normalization, chat/contact state, sync, sound/notification dispatch, menu wiring, update checks) lives on the single `MainWindow(wx.Frame)` class in `client/main.py` (~15,500 lines). When making a change, `grep` this file first — the method you need very likely already exists here rather than in a smaller module. `client/ui/conversations.py` (`ConversationsPanel`, ~9,200 lines) is the other large file, holding essentially all message-list/composer UI and behavior.

### Message/data pipeline
1. **`client/core/websocket_client.py`** (`WebSocketClient`) connects to WPPConnect's Socket.IO and normalizes raw WPPConnect/Baileys event payloads into WinZapp's canonical message dict shape: `{"key": {"remoteJid", "fromMe", "id", "participant"?}, "message": {...}, "messageType": "...", "messageTimestamp": ..., "pushName": "..."}`. All downstream code (`main.py`, `core/database.py`, `ui/conversations.py`) assumes this shape.
2. **`MainWindow.on_new_message()`** (live messages) and **`on_historical_message()`** (history-sync backfill) in `main.py` are the two funnels every incoming/echoed message passes through: they resolve `@lid`↔phone duplicates, match echoes of our own sends against locally-registered "pending" virtual messages, update in-memory `self.chats`, and schedule a debounced persist. Both — plus `_extract_lid_mapping()`, which `WebSocketClient.on_messages_upsert()` also calls directly on the Socket.IO thread, bypassing the other two entirely — are gated by `MainWindow._live_events_ready()`: a reused pairing WebSocket can start delivering events before `prepare_sync()` has created `self.db`, or before the initial sync has actually started, and processing a message that early either crashes (attribute doesn't exist yet) or lets a live event sneak a chat into the list ahead of the sync about to fetch the authoritative state. `is_countable_message()` (module-level in `main.py`) further excludes WhatsApp/WPPConnect system events (`groupNotification`, `protocolMessage` — group join/leave, settings changes, revokes) from ever bumping a chat's sort position, incrementing its unread badge, or firing a notification; they're still stored and shown as a timeline entry when the conversation is opened. **Edits**: WhatsApp re-delivers an edited message under its *original* `key.id` — `on_new_message()`'s same-id dedup check routes that into `_apply_possible_edit()`, which compares old vs. new text and updates the stored record in place if it changed. This only works live because `client/api_patches/src/util/createSessionUtil.ts` explicitly listens for wppconnect's `onMessageEdit` event and re-emits it through the same `'received-message'` Socket.IO event as a normal new message — an edit from someone else never fires `onAnyMessage` at all, so without that explicit listener the edit would be silently dropped server-side and never reach Python.
3. **Outgoing sends**: UI code in `client/ui/conversations.py` builds a "virtual" pending message dict (`_local_pending: True`, `_local_id: <uuid4>`) shown immediately in the UI, and hands it to **`client/core/message_queue.py`**'s `MessageQueue` (one background thread). The queue calls the matching `send_*` method on `MainWindow` (`send_text_message`, `send_audio_message`, `send_media_attachment`, `send_contact_attachment`), which POSTs to a WPPConnect REST endpoint and returns the real WhatsApp message ID. A send failure is classified before it's retried: an explicit "Disconnected" response leaves the message queued untouched, a timeout/dropped connection is treated as *ambiguous* (WhatsApp Web may have accepted it into its own outbox already) and is handed off without a resend, and only a definite server-side failure retries — at most 4 times. This exists because retrying an ambiguous failure used to duplicate real sends when connectivity flapped. Separately, the *same* sent message also arrives back through the WebSocket echo path (`on_new_message`, `from_me=True`) — since WPPConnect gives no client-side correlation ID on that echo, it's matched against pending virtual messages **by message type** (text/audio/image/etc.), not by content. Be careful here: matching the wrong pending message swaps real WhatsApp IDs between unrelated messages (wrong status, wrong audio file playback).
4. **`client/core/database.py`** (`DatabaseManager`) is a fully async `aiosqlite` layer — single serialized connection, WAL mode, per-write `asyncio.Lock`. Indexed columns (`jid`, `timestamp`) are plaintext; payload columns (`message_json`, `last_message_json`) are Fernet-encrypted with a per-install key (`data/secret.key`). Storage is SQLite-only (`messages.db`) — there is no `messages.dat` fallback or migration path any more; that legacy format was retired.
5. **`client/core/database_bridge.py`** (`DatabaseBridge`) is the sync façade `main.py` actually calls: it runs a dedicated background asyncio event loop in its own thread and dispatches every `DatabaseManager` call via `asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe(...).result(timeout=...)`, blocking the calling (wx/worker) thread until the call finishes or the timeout elapses. This exists because wx and the rest of the app are synchronous/thread-based, but the DB layer is async. The timeout (and `close()` refusing new calls / waiting briefly for in-flight ones to drain before stopping the loop) exist specifically to keep a stuck coroutine from freezing the whole app forever — that used to be the most commonly reported "WinZapp stopped responding" symptom.
6. **In-app video/audio playback — `client/core/video_player.py`** (`VideoPlayer`): audio is decoded directly from the source file by BASS (`sound_lib`, same engine used for voice messages elsewhere), while video frames are produced by a background `ffmpeg` process piping a low-rate MJPEG sequence into a `wx.StaticBitmap` via a `wx.Timer`. Shared by `ConversationsPanel` (Enter on a video message — `_play_toggle_video_message()`, applying the conversation's configured playback speed via BASS's Tempo FX) and `StatusPanel` (Enter/Space on a video or audio status). BASS has no video output at all, hence the separate ffmpeg frame pipe; sync between the two is deliberately approximate (`ffmpeg -re` real-time pacing), not frame-exact — see the module's own docstring for the full reasoning, including the EOF/tail-cutoff race it guards against via a `_generation` counter.

### JID handling — the recurring source of bugs
WhatsApp JIDs come in several forms and normalizing them wrong is the single most common bug source in this codebase:
- `@s.whatsapp.net` — modern phone JID (canonical form WinZapp normalizes everything to).
- `@c.us` — legacy phone JID format some WPPConnect responses still use; normalized to `@s.whatsapp.net` on load (`MainWindow.deduplicate_chats`, `_normalize_jid`).
- `@lid` — a linked/multi-device identifier (not a phone number). Must be bridged to a phone JID via the `_lid_to_phone` / `_phone_to_lid` caches (`main.py`) before it's usable for display, sending, or contact lookup. Brazilian numbers additionally need 8/9-digit interchangeability handling.
- `@g.us` — group JID. **Not trustworthy on its own**: WPPConnect/Baileys can emit a self-chat echo (seen with self-sent documents) whose `remoteJid` is built from a participant's own `@lid` digits but suffixed `@g.us` — i.e. a fake "group" whose JID equals a participant's JID, which real WhatsApp groups never do. `MainWindow.deduplicate_chats()` has a guard pass for this; `on_new_message()` redirects it at the source. If you touch group-detection logic, keep this invariant (`group_jid` digits are never a participant's digits) in mind.
- `@broadcast` — status/stories, routed to `_store_status_update`, never a normal conversation.
- `@newsletter` — WhatsApp channels; explicitly ignored.

### Pairing flow — nested modal dialogs
`Connect.show_connection_dial()` and `show_pairing_dial()` (`client/ui/dialogs/connect.py`) are both shown via `ShowModal()`, with `pairing_dial` nested inside `connection_dial`'s own modal loop (opened from a button handler running inside it). `WebSocketClient.on_pairing_complete()` (`core/websocket_client.py`) closes them once pairing succeeds — but wx only allows `EndModal()` on the loop that is actually running, and `EndModal()` doesn't unwind its loop immediately (it only signals it; that loop keeps dispatching pending events, including any `wx.CallAfter` queued from inside it). So `connection_dial` can only be closed from `show_pairing_dial()` itself, right after its own `ShowModal()` call has genuinely returned — not from `on_pairing_complete()`, inline or via a chained `CallAfter`, which both hit a `wx._core.wxAssertionError` ("IsRunning() failed") on the still-suspended parent loop. Getting this wrong reproduces as: pairing appears to succeed (connected sound plays), but the main window and tray icon never appear, sync never starts, and nothing is logged unless you instrument `EndModal()` calls directly — `MainWindow.__init__` just never returns from `show_connection_dial()`.

### Status tab (`client/status_panel.py`, Alt+5)
`StatusPanel` shows other contacts' WhatsApp statuses (stories) grouped by sender in `_status_list`, plus a `MyStatusDialog` for the user's own posted statuses. WPPConnect exposes no REST endpoint to query other users' statuses — the list is built entirely from `MainWindow._status_updates` (populated live by `_store_status_update()` as `status@broadcast` messages arrive over Socket.IO), not fetched on demand. Text/image/video/audio/document/sticker/contact status types all funnel through the module-level `_status_content_label()` helper for a translated content preview — every one of the panel's own near-duplicate copies of that switch used to fall through to the raw `messageType` string (e.g. literal `"audioMessage"`) for anything past text/image/video, so any future status type added here should go through that shared helper rather than a new inline copy. Video/audio playback reuses `core/video_player.py` (see above); Enter/Space on an already-open video or audio status list item toggles play/pause instead of re-selecting (which would otherwise `stop()` and restart the player — see `_is_current_status_playable()`). Reacting to (liking) someone else's status needs the poster's own `StatusV3Model` resolved via `WPP.status.get(posterJid).getAllMsgs()` in the Node layer (`deviceController.ts`'s `reactMessage`) — the general `Store.Msg.models` collection that `WPP.chat.sendReactionToMessage()` searches by default never contains another person's status at all.

### Paths, config, i18n
- `client/app_paths.py` abstracts dev-mode vs. frozen (PyInstaller onedir/onefile, and legacy Nuitka onefile) path resolution — always go through `resource_path()` (read-only bundled assets: sounds/, languages/, lib/) and `data_path()`/`log_path()` (writable runtime data next to the exe) rather than hardcoding paths.
- `client/config.py` loads an optional `.env` next to the exe (or repo root in dev) for overrides like `WINZAPP_GITHUB_REPO` (used by the auto-updater).
- `client/languages/{pt-BR,pt-PT,en-US,es-ES}.json` + `client/core/i18n.py` (`I18n.t(key)`) — pt-BR is the default/fallback locale. **When adding any user-facing string, add the key to all four files**, not just one.
- Runtime data (`data_path()`): `messages.db` (SQLite), `secret.key` (Fernet key), `settings.json` (seeded from `client/data/settings_default.json`), `voice_messages/`, `media/`.
- `core/utils.get_downloads_folder()` resolves the user's real Windows Downloads folder via `SHGetKnownFolderPath`/`FOLDERID_Downloads` (falling back to `~/Downloads` off-Windows or on API failure) — used as the default `defaultDir` for every "Save As" dialog (message attachments, status media). Never assume `~/Downloads` directly; it's wrong whenever the user has redirected Downloads elsewhere.
- `core/locale_format.py` reads the user's actual Windows "Regional format" (`GetLocaleInfoEx`) and translates it to `strftime` patterns for date/time display, instead of a format hardcoded per UI language — falls back to the language file's own `time_fmt`/`date_fmt`/`datetime_fmt` off-Windows or on API failure.
- Logging (`log_path()`): a single `log.log`, truncated at the start of every launch (plain `logging.FileHandler(mode="w")`, not a `RotatingFileHandler` — there are deliberately no `log.log.1`/`.2` backups). `setup_logging()` runs only after the single-instance mutex is acquired, so a second launch while WinZapp is already running never wipes the log of the instance actually doing the work. When diagnosing anything startup/pairing-related, this file's breadcrumb `logging.info(...)` calls (`[prepare_sync]`, `[init_UI]`, `[show_connection_dial]`, `[show_pairing_dial]`, `[on_pairing_complete]`, ...) are the fastest way to pinpoint exactly which step never happened — always ask for the current run's `log.log` rather than guessing.

### Secrets — WA_token storage (`client/core/token_vault.py`)
The WPPConnect session token is Fernet-encrypted with the same per-install key that backs DB payload encryption (`secret.key`, `MainWindow.retrieve_secret_key()`), not stored as plain JSON. Windows DPAPI was tried first but rejected: it ties the encrypted blob to one Windows user/machine, which would permanently break copying the whole WinZapp data folder to another device to carry a paired session over — a deliberately supported use case. Fernet with a key that travels alongside `settings.json` in the same folder keeps that portable. `MainWindow._get_wa_token()`/`_set_wa_token()` are the *only* sanctioned access points — every read/write of `settings["privateinfo"]["WA_token"]`/`WA_token_protected` must go through them (`main.py`, `connect.py`, `websocket_client.py` all do). `_get_wa_token()` transparently migrates a legacy plaintext `WA_token` to the protected field on first read; a value that fails to decrypt (corrupted, or encrypted under a different `secret.key`) is treated exactly like "no token saved" — never a crash.

### Accessibility constraints
This is the app's core differentiator, not an afterthought: UI is built from plain wx controls (`wx.ListCtrl`, `wx.TextCtrl`, standard menus/dialogs) specifically because screen readers can read them reliably — avoid custom-drawn/owner-drawn controls. Batch list mutations inside `Freeze()`/`Thaw()` so screen readers get one accessibility event instead of a flood. Dialog titles and list items must resolve human-readable names (contact/group name) rather than raw JIDs — NVDA will otherwise read out raw phone-number/JID digits.

### Auto-updater (`client/updater.py`)
`UpdateChecker` polls the GitHub Releases API (repo from `config.GITHUB_REPO`), compares `version.__version__` against the latest tag, and on acceptance downloads the release's ZIP asset, extracts it, and hands off to a generated `.bat` script that waits for the current process to exit, kills stray WPPConnect/Postgres processes on ports 6300/5433, copies files over the install dir, and relaunches — because Windows won't let a running process overwrite its own files.

### Packaging (`build.py`, `installer/`)
`build.py` runs PyInstaller (via CLI args with `--collect-all`, not the checked-in `client/WinZapp.spec`, which is stale/unused) to compile `client/main.py`, then for onedir builds also compiles the C installer/uninstaller stubs in `installer/` (gcc + windres), zips the staged app as a `ZIP_STORED` payload, and appends it to the installer stub to produce a single self-extracting `dist/WinZappInstaller.exe`, plus a plain `dist/WinZapp.zip` portable build. `client/api/` and `client/node/` are excluded from git and must exist on disk before running it.
