# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

Soulmask Codex — a full-stack game-data reference site for the Soulmask survival game. Three layers:

1. **Pipeline** (Python 3, no deps) — reverse-engineers UE4 modkit `.uasset` files into `Game/Parsed/*.json`
2. **Backend** (Go + chi) — serves a JSON API from a SQLite DB at `backend/internal/api/`
3. **Frontend** (React + Vite + TypeScript) — SPA in `web/`, embedded into the Go binary for prod

Deployed as a single binary on Fly.io (`soulmask-codex`, region `ams`). Live at **soulmask-codex.com**.

Docs: `docs/DATA.md` (data shapes, fill rates, cross-ref maps), `docs/DESIGN.md` (game-concept glossary).

## Key paths

| What              | Path                         | Notes                                    |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| SQLite DB         | `data/app.db`                | **the only DB file — do not create others** |
| Translations      | `data/translations/*.json`   | manual Chinese→English overrides         |
| Parsed JSON       | `Game/Parsed/*.json`         | committed pipeline output                |
| Exported tables   | `Game/Exports/*.json`        | committed UE4 DataTable exports          |
| Raw BP exports    | `uasset_export/`             | gitignored (~800 MB)                     |
| Backend source    | `backend/`                   | Go module `github.com/rubensayshi/soulmask-codex` |
| Frontend source   | `web/`                       | React + Vite, pnpm                       |
| DB schema         | `backend/internal/db/schema.sql` | single source of truth for tables    |
| Generated DB code | `backend/internal/db/gen/`   | sqlc output, do not edit                 |

**Do not create `.db` files anywhere else** (e.g. `data/soulmask.db`, `soulmask.db`). The backend flag defaults to `--db ../data/app.db`; `build_db.py` writes to `data/app.db`. Nothing else.

## Pipeline (two-stage, two-platform)

```
Modkit .uasset files  ──►  [Windows-only export]  ──►  uasset_export/  &  Game/Exports/
                                                       │
                                                       ▼
                                               [any platform parsing]
                                                       │
                                                       ▼
                                               Game/Parsed/*.json  ──►  data/app.db
```

**Stage 1 (Windows only, requires modkit at `C:\Program Files\Epic Games\SoulMaskModkit`):**
- `pipeline/run_export.bat` → runs `pipeline/export_tables.py` inside `UE4Editor-Cmd.exe` to export 11 DataTables to `Game/Exports/*.json`.
- UAssetGUI (manual, GUI tool) → exports BP_PeiFang / BP_DaoJu / BP_KJS `.uasset` files to `uasset_export/**/*.json.gz` (gitignored, ~800MB).

**Stage 2 (host Python 3, no deps):**
```bash
python3 pipeline/parse_exports.py     # drops.json     (from Game/Exports/)
python3 pipeline/parse_recipes.py     # recipes.json   (from uasset_export/Blueprints/PeiFang/)
python3 pipeline/parse_items.py       # items.json     (from uasset_export/Blueprints/DaoJu/)
python3 pipeline/parse_tech_tree.py   # tech_tree.json (from uasset_export/Blueprints/KeJiShu/)
```

Parsers are independent — run any one in isolation. Outputs are committed to git (`Game/Parsed/`).

**Stage 3: `pipeline/build_db.py`** — reads `Game/Parsed/*.json` + `data/translations/*.json`, writes `data/app.db` using `schema.sql` as the DDL source. Idempotent (drops and recreates).

**After running any individual parser, always run `make db`** to ensure downstream enrichment steps (classification, food buffs) and the SQLite rebuild are not lost. Running `parse_items.py` alone strips the `buffs` field that `parse_food_buffs.py` adds.

## Two distinct parsing strategies

The code uses **two different approaches** depending on whether the data was exported via UE4Editor or UAssetGUI — don't mix them up:

1. **DataTable rows (`parse_exports.py`)** — regex over UE4 property-export **text** (strings like `((SelectedRandomProbability=30, BaoNeiDaoJuInfos=((DaoJuClass=...)))`). See `split_top_level_parens` / `parse_daoju_bag_content`. Item refs get resolved via `parse_localization.load_names()` (PO-file lookup, keyed on normalized asset paths).

2. **Blueprint assets (`parse_recipes.py`, `parse_items.py`, `parse_tech_tree.py`)** — walk UAssetAPI's tagged-property **JSON tree**. Item references are negative ints into the `Imports` table; resolve with the shared helper:

```python
def resolve_import_path(imports, ref):
    # negative ref → index into Imports; OuterIndex chains to the Package import
    # that holds the /Game/... path
```

This helper (and `find_props` / `get_prop` / `text_zh`) is copy-pasted into each BP parser — they're ~identical but not factored out. Don't refactor casually; the duplication is intentional to keep each parser independently runnable.

## Non-obvious things

- **UE4.27 Python API is crippled.** `FieldIterator`, `EditorAssetLibrary.export_asset`, `AssetExportTask` with csv/json — all broken. `export_tables.py` works around this by reading the `.uasset` binary directly to scrape property names from the FName table, then probing each with `DataTableFunctionLibrary.get_data_table_column_as_string`. See README "Technical notes" — don't try to "clean this up" using the obvious-looking API calls, they don't work.

- **Chinese-only text.** `name_zh` / `description_zh` / `brief_zh` fields are populated; English resolution via PO localization is done only for `drops.json` (via `parse_localization.py`). Items/recipes/tech_tree still need an English-name join — gap #1 in `docs/DATA.md`. The PO files live in the Windows modkit; access to that machine is the blocker, not the code.

- **Path normalization** (`parse_localization.normalize_path`): strips `/Game/` prefix, CDO suffix (`.Default__X_C`), field suffix, lowercases. Any new PO-joined lookup must use the same normalization.

- **Description typo in source data:** main tech-tree nodes use `Desciption` (sic), subnodes use `Description`. `parse_tech_tree.py` checks both.

- **No shared module** between parsers. `resolve_import_path` / `find_props` / `get_prop` are duplicated across `parse_recipes.py`, `parse_items.py`, `parse_tech_tree.py`. If you need to fix a resolver bug, fix it in all three.

- `PROFICIENCY_MAP` and `STATION_MAP` in `parse_recipes.py` are hand-maintained Chinese→English lookups. When recipes appear with a raw Pinyin proficiency/station, add an entry here.

## Output invariants

- IDs are Blueprint filenames, no extension (`BP_PeiFang_WQ_ChangGong_1`, `Daoju_Item_Wood`).
- Cross-references (`recipe.output.item_id` → `items[].id`, `tech_node.unlocks_recipes[]` → `recipes[].id`, etc.) are documented with current coverage in `docs/DATA.md`. Changes that drop coverage are regressions even though there are no tests.
- `Game/Parsed/*.json` is committed; `Game/Exports/*.json` is committed; `uasset_export/` is gitignored (too big).

## Features overview

The app has five pages plus a persistent sidebar. Detailed feature inventory in `docs/FEATURES.md`.

| Page                | Route              | What it does                                                     |
| ------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Home                | `/`                | Hero, stats strip, featured crafting chains, changelog           |
| Item detail         | `/item/:id`        | Crafting flow tree, stats, quality tiers, drops, spawns, seeds   |
| Tech tree           | `/tech-tree`       | Tiered node viewer with dependency lines, 3 modes, search        |
| Awareness XP        | `/awareness-xp`    | Recipes ranked by XP/min, filterable by tier/skill/role          |
| Food almanac        | `/food-almanac`    | Tabbed comparison table of food/drink/potion buffs               |

Global: sidebar search (debounced API call) + recent visits history. Tweaks panel (bottom-right gear) controls raw-materials display. SEO: per-page meta, JSON-LD on items, XML sitemap.

## Changelog

The home page (`web/src/pages/Home.tsx`) has a `CHANGELOG` array shown to visitors. Update it when a change is user-visible (new data, new UI feature, meaningful fix). Skip internal refactors, parser tweaks, or pipeline changes.

Write entries as a player would understand them — what they can now *do*, not how it was built. Short, plain language, no jargon. Examples:
- Good: "Preview how quality tiers affect weapon damage and durability"
- Bad: "Extract and display base weapon/equipment stats from PropPack tables"

## Build and deploy

```bash
make build    # pnpm build → copy dist into backend/internal/spa/ → go build
make deploy   # icons-sync + fly deploy
```

The prod binary embeds the SPA via `backend/internal/spa/` and serves both API and static files on port 9060.

## Dev server

Managed via pm2 (`ecosystem.config.js`). Two processes: `souldb-be` (Go backend on :9060) and `souldb-fe` (Vite on :5173).

```bash
make dev         # pm2 start + status
make dev-stop    # stop both
make dev-status  # check what's running
make dev-logs    # tail logs
```

Backend auto-restarts on `.go` file changes (pm2 watch). Frontend uses Vite HMR. Before starting, run `pm2 status` to avoid port conflicts from an already-running instance.

## Makefile quick reference

| Target         | What it does                                                    |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `make db`      | parse + parse-spawns + rebuild `data/app.db` — the main command |
| `make parse`   | run all Stage 2 parsers (items, recipes, tech, drops, classify, food buffs) |
| `make sqlc`    | regenerate `backend/internal/db/gen/` from `queries.sql`        |
| `make build`   | SPA build + Go binary at `backend/bin/server`                   |
| `make deploy`  | icons-sync + `fly deploy`                                       |
| `make test`    | Go + web + Python test suites                                   |

## Frontend type-checking

After any frontend change, run `pnpm --dir web typecheck` to catch TypeScript errors before building. This is faster than a full `make build` and catches issues like unused variables, type mismatches, etc.

## Conventions

- Python 3.x, no external dependencies, no virtualenv needed for stage 2. `.venv/` exists in the repo but isn't required.
- Parsers print a summary (counts, by-category breakdowns, sample rows) to stdout — use this to sanity-check changes.
- Error files (`*_errors.json`) are written next to outputs and gitignored.
- DB queries: add SQL to `backend/internal/db/queries.sql`, run `make sqlc` to regenerate Go code. Do not edit `gen/` by hand.
