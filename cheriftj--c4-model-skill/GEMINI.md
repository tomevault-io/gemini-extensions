# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository purpose

This repo hosts a **Claude Code skill**, not an application. The skill `c4-model` teaches Claude how to produce C4 architecture diagrams (Simon Brown's model) as Mermaid + accompanying Markdown, across five distinct usage modes (design, document-code, document-prose, review, update) plus supporting diagram variants (Landscape, Deployment, Dynamic). Changes are validated manually by reading the skill end-to-end, by walking the test prompt matrix, and by running the automated test suite in `tests/claude-code/`.

The skill is authored in **English**. Keep prose, examples, and section headings in English when editing `SKILL.md` and its bundled files. The frontmatter `description` intentionally keeps a few French trigger phrases (*"modèle C4"*, *"diagramme d'architecture"*) to widen discoverability for bilingual users.

```

The skill's canonical location in this repo is `./skills/<name>/`, matching the convention used by `anthropics/skills` and community marketplaces. The folder name (`c4-model`) must match the `name` field in `SKILL.md`'s frontmatter **and** in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`.

### Progressive disclosure pattern

`SKILL.md` stays lean. It is the **router + shared contract** loaded every time the skill triggers. Detailed per-mode flows live in `mode-*.md` and are read on demand once the mode is detected. If you rename or move any of these files, update every reference in `SKILL.md` (the router table and the "Bundled references" section both point to them).

Two reference files (`mermaid-c4-syntax.md`, `review-checklist.md`) are grounded in authoritative external sources; keep a pointer to the source URL at the top so they can be re-synced if the upstream evolves. Editorial additions on top of sourced content must stay clearly labeled (*"Editorial advice"*, *"Additions specific to this skill"*).

## Editorial invariants

These rules are load-bearing for the skill's output quality. Preserve them when editing:

- **Mode detection first**: every run starts with identifying the mode (design / document-code / document-prose / review / update). Don't produce a diagram without knowing which workflow applies.
- **Simon Brown's golden rule**: Context + Container diagrams are enough for most teams. Levels 3 (Component) and 4 (Code) are produced only on explicit request or clear need. Don't dilute this guidance.
- **One Markdown document per level**, never a bare Mermaid block. The `level-template.md` structure (Overview / Diagram / Legend / Elements / Key relationships / Architectural decisions / Assumptions / Links) is the canonical shape.
- **Relation labels must state intent**: ban generic "Uses" / "Calls" / "Reads". Inter-container relations must include the protocol (HTTPS/JSON, gRPC, AMQP, JDBC, SMTP…).
- **Technology is mandatory** on every Container and Component.
- **Assumptions stay explicit**: anything inferred from partial info belongs in the "Assumptions" section, not silently baked into the diagram.
- **Interactive by default**: no finalized delivery without explicit user validation. The one exception is when the user asks for a quick v1 ("just generate a draft"); in that case produce it with assumptions clearly labeled.
- **Format and destination are negotiated**, not hardcoded. Default Mermaid + Markdown in `docs/architecture/` is a fallback, not a decision.

The review checklist in `review-checklist.md` is the source of truth for what "done" means; any new rule added to `SKILL.md` should be reflected there too (and vice versa) to avoid drift.

## Frontmatter contract

`SKILL.md` starts with YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`). The `description` is what Claude Code matches against user requests to decide whether to load the skill. It intentionally mixes English primary content with a few French trigger phrases ("modèle C4", "diagramme d'architecture") to widen discoverability. When editing, keep the English-first voice but preserve the French triggers and keep the trigger phrases broad enough to fire proactively on architecture-overview requests.

Keep the plugin entry in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` in sync with the skill's `name` and with the current version (`version` field, following SemVer).

## Validating changes

CI runs cheap, deterministic checks (markdownlint, JSON schema for the manifests, shellcheck, link check). The `claude -p` skill tests stay local because their output is non-deterministic. Validation before a PR is manual and comes in three layers:

1. **Read `SKILL.md` end-to-end** as if you were a fresh Claude instance. Does the mode router fire? Is the common contract clear?
2. **Walk [`tests/test-prompts.md`](./tests/test-prompts.md) mentally**. Would a fresh Claude produce the expected behavior for each mode? Check the "red flags" lists.
3. **Run the automated suite** when you have a `claude` binary available (see [`tests/claude-code/README.md`](./tests/claude-code/README.md)). The runner takes `--integration` for integration tests and `-v` for verbose output.

**TDD-for-skills principle**: prefer adding guidance *in response to an observed failure*, not by anticipation. If your change doesn't map to a failing test prompt, question whether it's needed. When a test fails, fix the skill; don't soften the test.

When you add a rule to `SKILL.md` or a `mode-*.md`, also:
- Reflect it in `review-checklist.md` if it's something a reviewer should check
- Add (or sharpen) a matching assertion in `tests/claude-code/test-c4-model.sh`
- Note the change in `CHANGELOG.md` under `## [Unreleased]`
