This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What is Fisher?

SQLite-backed Event Store and lightweight Document Database in the Critter Stack. A deliberate
subset of Marten (PostgreSQL) and Polecat (SQL Server), built on Weasel.Sqlite for schema management
and Weasel.Storage for the shared closed-shape document/event runtime.

**Fisher is early and incomplete.** See "Current state" below before assuming a feature exists,
[ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for what comes next and in what order, and [HANDOFF.md](HANDOFF.md) for the
compliance scoreboard and the current state of play.

## Commands

```bash
dotnet build fisher.slnx
dotnet test fisher.slnx                    # both TFMs; they run serially on purpose
dotnet test fisher.slnx -f net10.0         # one TFM

# One test class or method (Microsoft Testing Platform — note the bare `--`)
dotnet test src/Fisher.Tests/Fisher.Tests.csproj -f net10.0 -- --filter-method "*appending_events*"

# The documentation site
npm install
npm run docs                               # mdsnippets + dev server on :5173
npm run docs-build                         # a dead internal link fails the build
```

No database server is required — tests create throwaway SQLite files via
`TemporaryDatabase.Create()`.

Documentation code samples are compiled — see "The documentation site" below before editing a page's
code block.

## Architecture

### The three-layer split

Fisher owns very little storage code. The division is worth internalizing before adding anything:

- **JasperFx / JasperFx.Events** — event/projection/daemon abstractions. Implement its interfaces;
  do not reinvent them. `EventGraph` derives from `JasperFx.Events.EventRegistry`.
- **Weasel.Sqlite** — schema management, table definitions, migrations, the PRAGMA-applying
  `SqliteDataSource`, and `CommandBuilder`. All DDL goes through it; no hand-written CREATE TABLE.
  **All raw data access goes through it too** — see below.
- **Weasel.Storage** — the dialect-neutral closed-shape document + event storage runtime extracted
  from Marten. Fisher supplies two dialects (`SqliteStorageDialect<TId>`,
  `SqliteEventStoreDialect`) and the runtime does the rest. **Prefer extending the dialects over
  writing bespoke storage code.**

### Raw data access goes through Weasel.Sqlite first

**Reach for Weasel.Sqlite before writing ADO.NET by hand, and deviate only where it genuinely cannot
express what is needed.** Connections come from `SqliteDataSource` (via
`FisherDatabase.OpenConnectionAsync`), never from `new SqliteConnection(...)` in production code — the
data source is what applies the store's PRAGMA settings and what holds an in-memory database alive.
Statements are built with `Weasel.Sqlite.CommandBuilder` rather than by concatenating SQL and adding
parameters by hand, so parameter binding and placeholder handling stay in one implementation. Schema
work goes through Weasel's table definitions and migrations, which is what makes
`AutoCreate.None` honoured everywhere for free rather than at each call site's discretion.

**When Weasel.Sqlite cannot do it, the workaround is local, commented, filed upstream, and removed
when the fix ships.** That cycle has now run twice and closed twice, and **both removals are the
point of the rule** rather than a tidy-up:

- `FisherCommandBuilder` existed because `CommandBuilder` did not declare
  `Weasel.Core.ICommandBuilder`. Gone since weasel#424 shipped in 9.23.2 — do not reintroduce it.
- `DocumentTable.ConfigureQueryCommand` overrode Weasel's `pragma_table_info` query because it omits
  generated columns. Gone since [weasel#426](https://github.com/JasperFx/weasel/issues/426) shipped
  in **9.24.0** — do not reintroduce that either.

**The second one shows what the rule is actually protecting against**, because it was not removed on
the bump that fixed it and the cost arrived one release later. Weasel 9.25.0 added a fifth statement
(triggers) to the metadata query; Fisher's override still emitted four, and the override and the
reader that consumes it are one contract. The result was not a stale-but-harmless copy — it was
`ArgumentOutOfRangeException` out of `readForeignKeysAsync`, a result-set misalignment with nothing in
the message about Fisher or about generated columns. A deviation with no issue behind it is a
deviation nobody will ever remove; a deviation whose issue has *closed* is worse, because it now
diverges silently from the thing it was copied from.

**Reusable data-access helpers belong in Weasel.Sqlite eventually, so write them where they can move.**
The test is whether the helper would be equally correct for any SQLite consumer or whether it encodes
one of *Fisher's* storage decisions. `SqliteTimestamp`, `SqliteParameterValue`'s conversions, the row
readers and `FisherTableNaming` are all the latter — they are about the shape of Fisher's data, not
about SQLite, and they stay. Anything that is really "how you do X against SQLite" should be built as
a self-contained piece with no Fisher types in its signature, so pushing it upstream later is a file
move rather than a rewrite.

### SQLite divergences from Marten/Polecat

These are the decisions that don't transfer from the sibling stores, and the reasons they exist:

| Concern | Marten / Polecat | Fisher |
|---|---|---|
| Schemas | real DB schemas | **none** — `DatabaseSchemaName` folds into the table prefix (`FisherTableNaming`) |
| Timestamps | `timestamptz` / `datetimeoffset` | ISO-8601 TEXT (`SqliteTimestamp`) |
| JSON | `jsonb` / native `json` | TEXT + json1 functions |
| Booleans | `boolean` / `bit` | INTEGER 0/1 |
| Guids | native | TEXT — bind via `SqliteStorageDialect<T>.ToDatabaseValue` |
| Event sequence | sequence / IDENTITY | `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT` |
| Append concurrency | advisory lock / UPDLOCK,HOLDLOCK | `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` (`IsolationLevel.Serializable`) |
| Document upsert | `MERGE` (Polecat) | `INSERT … ON CONFLICT … DO UPDATE … RETURNING`, as Marten |
| Exclusive append | row lock — the loser **waits** | no row lock — the loser **fails** (see below) |
| Sequence read-back | bulk function / `OUTPUT ... INTO` | trailing SELECT by stream + version range |
| Load-many ids | `= ANY($1)` / `OPENJSON` | `json_each(@ids)` |
| Hi-Lo advance | stored function / optimistic UPDATE + retry | one atomic upsert (see below) |
| Unit of work | parallel, aggregates failures | strictly sequential (one writer per file) |
| Transient retry | none needed | real Polly retry on `SQLITE_BUSY` / `SQLITE_LOCKED` |

**`AppendExclusive` / `FetchForExclusiveWriting` / `WriteExclusivelyToAggregate` are the optimistic
methods.** Marten and Polecat take a row lock so a competing session waits its turn. SQLite has no
row locks and one writer per database file, so the equivalent would be holding a `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`
open from the fetch until `SaveChangesAsync` — blocking every other writer in the process for as long
as the caller holds the session. The safety property is unchanged (the version guard still runs inside
the write transaction, so no lost update); what differs is that a loser gets
`EventStreamUnexpectedMaxEventIdException` instead of waiting. Revisiting this means giving
`FisherSession` a session-scoped transaction, which `SaveChangesAsync` would then have to join rather
than open.

**Losing the *file's* write lock is a different failure from losing a version guard, and it now has
the Critter Stack's vocabulary** (fisher#306). Contention is still retried by
`StoreOptions.ResiliencePipeline` and still recorded on the span and on `fisher.write_lock.retries`;
what changed is what a caller sees once the retries were not enough — `Fisher.Exceptions.StreamLockedException`,
deriving from the lifted `JasperFx.Events.StreamLockedException`, where a raw `SqliteException` saying
"database is locked" used to escape. Marten and Polecat both surface their lock contention as that
type, so a store-agnostic `catch` and a Wolverine `OnException<StreamLockedException>()` policy —
matched with `ex is T` — now behave the same on all three. Three decisions in it:

- **A documents-only unit of work keeps the raw `SqliteException`.** A `StreamLockedException` naming
  no stream would say less than the driver already does.
  `a_documents_only_commit_keeps_the_raw_sqlite_exception` is the discriminating fact — translating
  unconditionally passes every other test in that class and fails only this one.
- **`StreamIds` beside the base's single `StreamId`.** The siblings lock a *row*, so their version of
  this really is about one stream; SQLite locks the *file*, so every stream in the commit lost it
  together. The base property carries the first, which is the whole of it for the aggregate-handler
  shape and is what ports.
- **An enlisted session gets it too.** `SessionOptions.ForTransaction` runs no pipeline — a retry
  would rewrite what the first attempt already put in the caller's still-open transaction — so its
  contention surfaces on the first statement with no retries at all. That is the documented rough
  edge of a deferred caller transaction, where the loser gets `SQLITE_BUSY` rather than a clean
  concurrency failure; the condition is identical and so is the vocabulary now.

⚠️ **The test has to warm the session's connection before contending, or it tests the wrong thing.**
Opening a Fisher connection applies the store's PRAGMAs and `journal_mode` wants the write lock, so a
session that first touches the file under contention fails while *opening* — a long way from the
commit path — and the raw exception escapes untranslated because it never reached the translation.
Same trap `a_busy_retry_is_recorded_on_the_span_it_contended` records from the other side.

Traps that have already bitten and are easy to reintroduce:

- A column `DEFAULT` that is an expression **must be parenthesized** — `DEFAULT strftime(...)` is a
  CREATE TABLE syntax error. Use `SqliteTimestamp.NowDefaultExpression` in DDL,
  `NowExpression` inside statements.
- `AUTOINCREMENT` on `fi_events.seq_id` is load-bearing, not decorative. A bare `INTEGER PRIMARY
  KEY` aliases the rowid, which SQLite **reuses** after a delete; a reused seq_id would silently
  hide events from every async projection behind the daemon's high-water mark.
- Constraint-violation mapping needs the **extended** result code. Every constraint failure shares
  primary code `SQLITE_CONSTRAINT` (19); only 1555 (PRIMARYKEY) / 2067 (UNIQUE) distinguish them.
- Binding a `Guid` without conversion writes a 16-byte BLOB that never matches the TEXT the schema
  holds.
- **`pragma_table_info` omits generated columns.** A table carrying one never converges through
  Weasel's delta detection — see "Duplicated fields".
- **A `Guid` bound as a TEXT parameter is written UPPERCASE.** Microsoft.Data.Sqlite emits the
  uppercase form for a raw `Guid`; `SqliteStorageDialect<T>.ToDatabaseValue` emits the lowercase
  canonical form. SQLite's default collation is case-sensitive, so mixing the two writes rows that
  can never be read back — every load returns null and every `json_each` id match fails, silently and
  only for Guid-identified types. This is why `SqliteGuidIdentification` exists: the shared write
  operations bind `Identification.ToRawSqlValue` directly, bypassing the dialect, so the conversion
  has to live in the identity strategy. `a_guid_id_is_stored_as_lowercase_canonical_text` pins it.

### Row readers

`FisherEventsRowReader` and `FisherStreamsRowReader` own the canonical SELECT projection and lock
the column order — adding or renaming a column means changing those files and only those files.

Every conversion in them is **explicit** (`Guid.Parse`, `SqliteTimestamp.FromDatabaseValue`,
`GetInt64(..) != 0`) rather than `GetGuid` / `GetFieldValue<DateTimeOffset>` / `GetBoolean`. The
write path converts explicitly on the way in, so reading through a provider convenience method
would leave the round trip depending on Microsoft.Data.Sqlite's coercion rules instead of Fisher's
own storage decisions — asymmetry that breaks quietly under a provider upgrade.

### Table naming

`main` → `fi_events`; any other `DatabaseSchemaName` → `compliance_fi_events`. Every `DbObjectName`
uses schema `main`, so nothing ever renders as qualified SQL. This is what gives logical-store and
test isolation inside one database file without ATTACH lifecycle on every pooled connection.

### Serialization is Weasel's, and so is the adapter

`Fisher.Serialization.Serializer` is a **subclass of `Weasel.Core.SystemTextJsonSerializer` with an
empty body** (weasel#555). It and Polecat's were byte-identical — the same options plumbing, the same
`ToJson`/`FromJson` matrix, and, the part worth naming, the same `[UnconditionalSuppressMessage]`
justifications on every reflection-based member. All of that is upstream now, suppressions included,
so **the trim/AOT contract Fisher documents is the one the shared base declares** rather than a second
copy free to drift from it.

What stays in Fisher is the identity: the type name `StoreOptions.Serializer` defaults to and that
applications subclass, in Fisher's namespace, declaring Fisher's two interfaces. Both declarations are
satisfied entirely by inheritance, and neither is redundant —

- `Fisher.Serialization.ISerializer` extends `Weasel.Core.ISerializer` with the two string-based
  overloads. The shared base carries both, with the propagating
  `[RequiresUnreferencedCode]`/`[RequiresDynamicCode]` those two, and only those two, are meant to
  have.
- `Weasel.Storage.IStorageSerializer` lives in Weasel.Storage, which references Weasel.Core, so the
  base *cannot* declare it — but it carries every member with BCL-typed signatures, which is what lets
  a subclass declare the interface and satisfy it by inheriting. That is why
  `StorageSerializerAdapter.For` hands the default serializer straight back rather than wrapping it.

**`Fisher.Serialization.StorageSerializerAdapter` is deleted**; `Weasel.Storage.StorageSerializerAdapter`
(public since 9.31.0) is the same class and is what the three call sites use. Note that
`EventGraph.BuildClosedShapeEventStorage` names it fully qualified: that file imports
`Fisher.Serialization`, so an unqualified reference would be ambiguous the moment anyone reintroduces
a local one — which is exactly the signal wanted.

`shared_serializer` pins the shape rather than the behaviour, on purpose: behaviour is covered
everywhere a document or event round-trips, and what a subclass can silently lose is an interface
declaration that stops being satisfied by inheritance and quietly falls through to the adapter.

### Closed upstream gap — weasel#423

Historical note, in case the shape of the session's execute loop looks over-engineered. Fisher used
to carry a `FisherCommandBuilder` shim because Weasel.Sqlite's `CommandBuilder` did not declare
`Weasel.Core.ICommandBuilder`, the surface every shared closed-shape storage operation configures
itself against — without it, no Weasel.Storage operation could be configured against a SQLite command
builder at all.

Fixed upstream by [weasel#424](https://github.com/JasperFx/weasel/pull/424) and shipped in
**Weasel.Sqlite 9.23.2**. The shim is gone; `FisherSession` uses `Weasel.Sqlite.CommandBuilder`
directly. Do not reintroduce it.

### One execution and one reader per operation, and what that immunizes

`FisherSession.ExecuteBatchAsync` executes each queued operation **on its own, against its own
reader**, sharing only the transaction. The reasons are in its remarks — operations bind by position,
and Fisher's append ends in a SELECT — and the consequence is worth stating separately, because it is
what a whole class of bug needs (fisher#66).

**What is shared is the prepared statement, and only across a consecutive run (fisher#171).**
`ReusedCommand` holds the command last prepared on the connection and hands it back when the next
operation compiles to character-identical SQL, moving that operation's parameters onto it;
Microsoft.Data.Sqlite keeps a command's prepared statements alive while its `CommandText` does not
change, so a hundred-document save is one `sqlite3_prepare_v2` rather than a hundred — inside the
exclusive `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` transaction, so it is write-lock time rather than merely CPU. Runs are
coalesced and nothing is ever reordered: a mixed batch falls back to a command per operation, having
paid one string comparison per step. **Grouping the batch by statement would coalesce more and is
refused**, because the queue's order is load-bearing — an event's tag rows are deleted before the
event itself (fisher#6), and the foreign key enforces it.

**Concatenating the batch into one multi-statement command is the obvious version of this and is
measurably the wrong fix here.** Measured against Microsoft.Data.Sqlite 10.0.9 before anything was
built: 1000 single-row upserts in one transaction take 4–6 ms as separate commands and **82–192 ms
concatenated**. The cost is parameter binding, not statements — the same 1000 statements with their
values inlined and no parameters run in 7.5 ms, and chunking traces the quadratic in the open (10 per
command 10 ms, 50 per command 22 ms, 250 per command 59 ms), because `SqliteParameterCollection` is
rebound per prepared statement against the whole collection. **Every chunk size measured is worse than
a command per operation**, so there is no sweet spot to tune to; the ceilings are not the constraint
either (50,000 parameters and 50,000 statements in one command both execute). Do not reach for it
again without re-measuring.

Marten concatenates a unit of work into one command and walks the result sets with `NextResultAsync`,
skipping the advance for an operation marked `Weasel.Storage.NoDataReturnedCall`. marten#5210 was an
operation carrying that marker whose SQL *did* return a row, so the reader stayed one result set
behind and **every operation after it in the batch postprocessed against somebody else's rows** —
silently, with the symptom surfacing nowhere near the cause. Fisher has no `NextResult` walk to fall
behind, so a mislabelled operation costs nothing;
`no_data_returned_operations.a_mislabelled_operation_cannot_misalign_the_batch` plants exactly that
shape rather than leaving the immunity to be inferred. **fisher#171 did not weaken this** — sharing a
prepared statement is not sharing a reader, and that test still passes unchanged.

**Microsoft.Data.Sqlite makes the concatenated shape sharper than Marten's, not softer**, which is the
second and more important reason not to reach for it. It surfaces a result set only for statements
that return *columns*: a four-statement command whose second and fourth statements select yields
exactly **two** result sets, so a `NextResult` walk's alignment would rest entirely on
`NoDataReturnedCall` being truthful — the thing marten#5210 proves cannot be assumed. Worth knowing
precisely, because the near-miss is the other way round: a guarded upsert matching no row **does**
surface its own empty result set (the provider skips zero-*column* statements, not zero-*row* ones),
so the optimistic-concurrency read is not what would break first. The marker is.

The marker is still audited — it is a claim a reader would trust, and the execution strategy could
change — by *executing* each marked operation's compiled SQL and asserting it returns no columns. The
audit is a claim about the statement, not its spelling: what would go wrong is a `returning` clause
added to a statement whose operation still declares no-data.

## Current state

Working, with tests:

- `fi_streams` / `fi_events` / `fi_event_progression` schema via Weasel.Sqlite
- `SqliteStorageDialect<TId>` and `SqliteEventStoreDialect` (Quick append + auxiliary operations)
- `DocumentStore`, `FisherSession` unit of work, `EventOperations`
- `StartStream` / `Append`, version assignment, optimistic concurrency, sequence read-back
- Reads: `FetchStreamAsync` (version / from-version / timestamp bounded), `FetchStreamStateAsync`,
  `LoadAsync`, both stream identity styles
- `ArchiveStream` / `UnArchiveStream` / `TombstoneStream` — and **an archived stream refuses further
  appends** (`Exceptions.ArchivedStreamException`, which subclasses the lifted
  `JasperFx.Events.ArchivedStreamException` since fisher#307 — the lift took Fisher's type as its
  canonical shape), because archiving is not a soft delete
  you can keep writing through. Checked in `AppendPlanner.PlanStream` before the version guard and
  deliberately *not* for a `StartStream`, where an archived id is still an id in use and
  `ExistingStreamIdCollisionException` is the more useful answer. An `Archived` event reaching a
  single stream projection that owns the stream archives it too, through
  `FisherProjectionStorage.ArchiveStream`
- Live aggregation: `AggregateStreamAsync`, `AggregateStreamToLastKnownAsync`, over auto-discovered
  self-aggregating types
- Inline projections: `Projections.Snapshot<T>` and `Projections.Add`, applied during
  `SaveChangesAsync` in the same transaction as the events
- `FetchForWriting` / `WriteToAggregate` / `AppendOptimistic` / `FetchLatest` / `ProjectLatest`, with
  the shared opt-in second-level aggregate cache behind `FetchForWriting`
  (`Events.CacheAggregatesForWriting<T>()`)
- `EventOperations` implements the full `IEventStoreOperations` — see below for which members throw
- Document storage over Guid, string, int and long ids; numeric ids via Hi-Lo sequences (`fi_hilo`)
- `EventProjection.storeEntity` — an `EventProjection`'s `Create`/`Project` results are stored inline
- `DocumentStore.Advanced` — `Clean`, `ResetAllDataAsync`, `ResetHiloSequenceFloorAsync<T>`, the
  daemon escape hatches (`AdvanceHighWaterMarkToLatestAsync`, `TryCorrectProgressInDatabaseAsync`),
  the projection progress reads, `RebuildSingleStreamAsync<T>` and `DeleteAllTenantDataAsync`
- `DocumentStore : IEventStore` — the explorer reads (`GetRecentStreamsAsync`,
  `GetStreamMetadataAsync`) and `TryCreateUsage`; see below
- **LINQ** — `session.Query<T>()` over `json_extract`: where, ordering, paging, projections, grouping,
  aggregates and **joins** (`Join` / `GroupJoin(...).SelectMany(...)`, chained across any number of
  tables), with async terminals
- **DCB tags** — tag tables, tagged appends, `QueryByTagsAsync`, `EventsExistAsync`,
  `AssignTagWhere`, `AggregateByTagsAsync`, `FetchForWritingByTags` with its consistency guard, and
  batched queries
- **Async daemon** — `IEventDatabase` on `FisherDatabase`, `FisherHighWaterDetector`,
  `FisherEventLoader`, `FisherProjectionBatch`, `IEventStore<IDocumentSession, IQuerySession>` on
  `DocumentStore`, `FisherProjectionDaemon`, and `Snapshot<T>(SnapshotLifecycle.Async)`
- **Dead letters** — `fi_dead_letters`, so `SkipApplyErrors` quarantines a poison event instead of
  stopping its shard
- **Projection side effects** — `IMessageOutbox` / `IMessageBatch`, with both commit paths bracketing
  their transaction; the default outbox drops every message
- **Event-emitting async projections** — a projection's raised events are planned and appended inside
  the batch's own transaction
- **Multi-stream projections** — `MultiStreamProjection<TDoc, TId>`, with `Identity` / `Identities` /
  `FanOut` grouping, inline and async
- **Subscriptions** — `Projections.Subscribe(...)`, a daemon shard driving arbitrary code over each
  range of events, its writes committing in the batch's transaction
- **DI registration** — `AddFisher(...)`, scoped sessions, and hosted services for schema application
  and the async daemon
- **Container-scoped projections and subscriptions** — `AddProjectionWithServices<T>` and
  `AddSubscriptionWithServices<T>`, so a projection or subscription takes injected services, resolved
  from a fresh IoC scope per unit of work
- **The command line** — `ISystemPart` and `IDatabaseSource` registered from both `AddFisher` and
  `AddFisherStore<T>`, so `db-apply` / `db-assert` / `db-patch` / `db-dump`, the `resources` commands
  and `describe` all see a Fisher store; plus `AssertDatabaseMatchesConfigurationOnStartup()`
- **The Event Model, derived from the store** — `AddFisher` and `AddFisherStore<T>` each register a
  `ProjectionEventModelSource`, so every registered projection is a View slice on an Event Model canvas
  with nothing written down by hand
- **Schema preview, programmatically** — `Advanced.CreateMigrationAsync` (the default database, one
  tenant, or every database), `WriteMigrationFileAsync`, `WriteScriptsByTypeAsync`, `AllObjects` and
  `AllSchemaNames`, so a deployment or a test can ask what a migration *would* change without
  applying it or shelling out to `db-patch`
- **Flat-table projections** — `FlatTableProjection`, projecting into a plain relational table
  through declarative column mappings rather than into a document
- **Soft delete** — `is_deleted` / `deleted_at`, `HardDelete`, `DeleteWhere` / `HardDeleteWhere` /
  `UndoDeleteWhere`, and the `MaybeDeleted` / `IsDeleted` / `DeletedSince` / `DeletedBefore` query
  operators
- **Duplicated fields** — `Schema.For<T>().Duplicate(x => x.Name)`, as an indexed SQLite `VIRTUAL`
  generated column, so a predicate against that member is served by an index
- **User-declared indexes** — `Schema.For<T>().Index(x => x.Name)` / `.UniqueIndex(...)`, as SQLite
  expression indexes that add no column at all
- **Vector search** — `Schema.For<T>().VectorIndex(x => x.Embedding, dimensions)` or
  `[VectorIndex(dimensions)]`, `session.VectorSearchAsync<T>(...)` and the scored
  `VectorSearchWithScoresAsync<T>(...)`, brute force over the stored JSON through a registered
  `fi_vector_distance` function — no side table, no trigger, no native extension
- **Hybrid search** — `HybridSearchAsync<T>(...)`, reciprocal rank fusion over the full-text and
  vector legs, so each covers the other's recall hole
- **Vector projections** — `VectorProjection<TDoc, TId>`, embeddings produced from an event stream
  with SHA-256 content-hash skipping, so an unchanged body costs no embedding call
- **Document metadata member mapping** — `guid_version`, `last_modified`, `is_deleted` and
  `deleted_at` projected back onto members of the document, by interface, attribute or DSL
- **Strong-typed identities** — a wrapper around any of the four id types, as an aggregate's identity
  and as a document's
- **Event rewriting** — `OverwriteEvent`, `CompletelyReplaceEvent`, event data masking through
  `Advanced.ApplyEventDataMaskingAsync`, and stream compacting via `CompactStreamAsync<T>`
- **Event upcasting** — `Events.Upcasters`, over the shared `JasperFx.Events.Upcasting` contract: an
  old stored event schema is reinterpreted as the current CLR event type on every read path, so the
  old type can be deleted from the codebase
- **Sessions and `SessionOptions`** — `QuerySession()` and `OpenSession(SessionOptions)` on the store,
  and enlistment: a session running on a connection or inside a transaction the caller owns
- **Session tracking** — an identity map, dirty tracking, and `Eject` / `EjectAllOfType` /
  `EjectAllPendingChanges`, through `SessionOptions.Tracking` and the `IdentitySession()` /
  `DirtyTrackedSession()` factories
- **Session listeners** — `IDocumentSessionListener` and `IChangeSet`, registered store-wide or per
  session, bracketing the unit of work the same way the outbox does
- **Cross-tenant writes** — `session.ForTenant(id)`, so one `SaveChangesAsync` writes several tenants'
  documents and streams in one transaction
- **Document foreign keys** — `Schema.For<T>().ForeignKey<TOther>(x => x.OtherId)`, enforced, with
  cascade options; the child column is the generated one a duplicated field creates
- **Declarative and store-wide configuration** — `[Index]` / `[UniqueIndex]` / `[DuplicateField]` /
  `[HiloSequence]`, `AddSubClassHierarchy()`, `StoreOptions.Policies` and `StoreOptions.InitialData`
- **Binary event bodies** — `JasperFx.Events.BinaryEventAttribute` or
  `Events.UseBinarySerializer<TEvent>(…)` over a supplied `JasperFx.Events.IEventBinarySerializer`,
  stored in an always-present `data_binary` BLOB column beside the JSON one
- **Document-side tooling** — `IDocumentStoreUsageSource`, `IDocumentStoreDiagnostics` and projection
  step-through, so a monitoring console sees the document half as well as the event half
- **Tracing** — an `ActivitySource` named `Fisher`, with spans for commits, queries and loads and a
  retry event that says a call waited on the write lock
- **Metrics** — a `Meter` named `Fisher`, with opt-in instruments for the write-lock wait, busy
  retries, events appended and documents written
- **Session logging** — `IFisherLogger` / `IFisherSessionLogger`, `StoreOptions.Logger(...)` and
  `session.Logger`, with the SQL, the parameters, the commit counts and both failure shapes
- **Multi-store registration** — `AddFisherStore<T>` and `IConfigureFisher`, so several independently
  configured stores live in one container
- **Database-per-tenant** — `ITenancy` and a SQLite file per tenant, with per-database migration, the
  async daemon routed per database, and tenants that appear, suspend and resume at runtime
- **A tenant registry** — `MultiTenantedDatabasesInRegistry(...)`, Marten's master-table tenancy over
  Weasel's lifted `MasterTableTenancyBase`: the tenant set held in a control table in a SQLite
  registry database, durable across restarts and shared between processes, with tenants added,
  suspended, resumed and removed at runtime — and never deleted
- **Transaction participants** — `ITransactionParticipant`, so an application's own writes commit in
  Fisher's transaction rather than contending with it for the file's one write lock
- **The store-agnostic document contract** — `JasperFx.Events.Documents`, implemented by Fisher's own
  session and store types with no adapter, so a consumer can hold a document session without naming
  Fisher
- **`Fisher.AspNetCore`** — streaming `IResult` types over the JSON reads, ETag/`304` handling, event
  stream results, and a high-water health check
- **`Fisher.EntityFrameworkCore`** — a `DbContext` saving inside Fisher's transaction, and projections
  whose documents are EF entities

Not implemented yet — do not assume these work. **There are no open issues as of 2026-08-12**, so this
list and the deliberate gaps in HANDOFF.md are the live account rather than the tracker; these are the
ones most likely to be assumed present:

- **A message bus** — the side-effect seam exists and the default outbox drops every message. That is
  the end state, not a gap: fisher#8 was closed wontfix, and delivery is a bus integration's job here
  as it is on both siblings.

### Registering a projection by type

`Projections.Add<T>(lifecycle)` (fisher#76) **hides an inherited overload rather than adding a missing
one**, and that is the whole content of the fix. `ProjectionGraph.Add<TProjectionType>` compiled on
Fisher already and went straight to `All.Add`, bypassing `Register` — so it invoked neither
`onAddProjection`, which registers the projection's event types (without which a read-only process
cannot resolve them by name), nor `FisherProjectionOptions.Add`'s `PublishedTypes()` sweep, **without
which the projection's document type is never mapped and its table is never created**. Both silent at
registration; the symptom is `no such table` on the first event, or a rebuild that finds nothing.

The `new` overload routes through the instance form, so the two spellings mean the same thing. Its
constraint is deliberately *weaker* than the base's (`ProjectionBase, new()` rather than also
`IProjectionSource`), because the instance form wraps a bare `IProjection` and refusing one here would
decline a projection the store runs perfectly well; every call that satisfied the base still compiles.
`registering_a_projection_by_type` asserts equivalence with the instance form rather than existence,
which is the property that was actually missing.

### Inline projections

`Snapshot<T>` closes `SingleStreamProjection<TDoc, TId>` over the aggregate's own identity type — the
same rule live aggregation follows, for the same source-generator reason — and registers the document
mapping so the snapshot's table is created with the schema.

Applying them happens in `FisherSession.SaveChangesAsync` **before the batch is taken**, because
applying a projection queues further operations (the snapshot writes) that have to commit alongside
the events that caused them.

The subtle part is versioning. A projection needs its events to already know their versions, but
Fisher normally assigns those inside the write transaction, where the current stream version has just
been read under the write lock. `AppendPlanner.AssignVersionsAheadOfProjectionsAsync` therefore reads
the version early, *outside* the lock. **That is not a weakened guard**: the same versions are
re-derived inside the transaction and the optimistic concurrency check still runs there, so a racing
writer still fails the commit. The early pass exists only to give projections something to read.

Document tables are created on demand at commit (`EnsureDocumentTablesAsync`), because a document
type can be stored without ever being registered and a snapshot type is registered by projection
configuration — either way the first write may be the first time the table is needed. Only types the
schema has already mapped are considered, which is how a document operation is told apart from an
event one.

### Reads provision the table too

**Reaching that path from the write side only was fisher#74.** A `Query<T>()` or `LoadAsync<T>` against
a type nothing had written yet failed with a raw `no such table`, where Marten and Polecat provision it
and return an empty result. That is not an exotic shape — it is what every cold start does (resolve a
cache before anything populates it, list a collection on a fresh install), and it is **asymmetric in
the worst direction: it works on a warm database and fails on a fresh one**, so it passes in
development and fails on first deploy.

`FisherSession.EnsureDocumentTableForReadAsync` is the read-side entry, with three callers:

- **`FisherQueryProvider.CommandFor`**, which is where every LINQ terminal converges — the same reason
  the query span is opened there. A per-terminal call would be a dozen copies of one line and the one
  that got forgotten would be the terminal nobody exercises against a fresh database. The types come
  from `Statement.DocumentTypes`, which is the only thing on a statement that is not about rendering
  SQL; the walk follows `Subquery`, because a count or an aggregate over a paged query holds the real
  statement there, and each join adds its own side.
- **`LoadByIdAsync` / `LoadManyByIdAsync`**, which go through storage rather than through LINQ.
- **`MetadataForAsync`**, hand-built SQL and therefore its own caller — as it already is of the three
  implicit filters.

`CheckExistsAsync` and `LoadJsonAsync` need nothing, being routed through the LINQ path already.

Three things that are decisions:

- **A type with registered projection storage is skipped**, the same guard `FetchProjectionStorageAsync`
  applies. Its rows are not in a Fisher document table, so provisioning would create one nothing ever
  writes to.
- **An enlisted session asserts rather than creating**, which is exactly what the write path does and
  for the identical reason: the migration runs on its own connection and would block against the write
  lock the caller's transaction is holding — a session deadlocking against itself. Naming the type
  beats that, and beats the raw SQLite error it replaced.
- **`AutoCreate.None` is honoured: the on-demand path checks and declines** (fisher#81). Weasel's
  `ApplyAllConfiguredChangesToDatabaseAsync` upgrades `None` to `CreateOrUpdate`, because that call
  *is* the explicit "apply it" — correct for the call as Weasel means it, and wrong for a path whose
  whole point is that it fires implicitly, on the first write and (since fisher#74) the first read of a
  document type. So a store configured "the schema is not yours to change" was still issuing DDL from
  inside a session, while `HiloSequence` checked the same setting and declined. Both halves were
  answered together, because answering the read alone would make the weaker operation the stricter one
  — `a_read_and_a_write_agree_about_auto_create_none` still pins that they agree, having been rewritten
  to pin the refusal rather than the provisioning.
  - **An existing table is not an error**, so the common case for a store deploying this way — schema
    applied out of band — is untouched. `auto_create_none_is_happy_once_the_schema_has_been_applied`
    exists because "honours `AutoCreate.None`" could otherwise be an unconditional throw and still pass.
  - **A refused type is removed from the ensured-tables cache**, the same discipline that keeps the
    first-use migration uncached until it succeeds. Without it the second call succeeds silently and the
    failure resurfaces as `no such table` from wherever the caller went next — and worse, a read would
    cache the type and let the *write* through. Verified by removing it: two tests fail.
  - The message names the document type, the setting, and the call to make — strictly better than the
    raw `SQLite Error 1: no such table` about a name the caller never wrote.

### The event tables are created on first use too — fisher#333

**fisher#74 did the document half and left the event half behind.** The event tables were created only
by an explicit migration, so on a fresh file the first append failed with `no such table: fi_streams`
under **every** `AutoCreate`, `All` included — while a document read on the same store worked. That
asymmetry is what made it expensive: the on-demand document path creates enough tables that a fresh
file *looks* provisioned, which is how CritterWatch's SQLite console failed every message it handled.
Fisher's own suite could not see it, because every fixture applies the schema in `InitializeAsync`;
`event_tables_on_first_use` is the class that deliberately never does.

`FisherDatabase.EnsureEventStorageAsync` is `EnsureDocumentTableAsync`'s rules one feature over — only
the event store's own schema objects are diffed, nothing is remembered until it succeeds, and
`AutoCreate.None` checks and declines, naming `ApplyAllDatabaseChangesOnStartup()`. A flag rather than
a per-type cache, since the event tables are one feature and migrate together. Four ways in:

- **`FisherSession.EventConnectionAsync`** — every event read a session runs, which is the event half
  of fisher#74's read-side provisioning. A fresh file answers "no events".
- **`SaveChangesAsync`, before the inline projections** — assigning versions ahead of them is the first
  read of `fi_streams`, and it has to be before the transaction because creating the tables is its own
  migration on its own connection.
- **`Events.Storage.IEventStorageOperation`**, a marker on the queued event-side operations (archive,
  tombstone, tag assignment, the rewrites), because a unit of work can be *only* one of those with no
  append to have ensured anything. `DocumentType` cannot say it: the event operations report
  `typeof(object)` or `typeof(IEvent)` about as often as raw SQL and flat-table writes do.
- **`IEventDatabase.EnsureStorageExistsAsync(typeof(IEvent))`**, which the daemon has always called
  before starting and which used to fall through to a no-op.

**An enlisted session asserts rather than creating**, remembered per session rather than on the
database — a table the caller created in a transaction they may yet roll back is not a fact about the
file. **The monitoring reads do not provision**: those are fisher#332's, which answers "no results"
instead, because a console pointed at a store must not be what changes its schema.

### The monitoring reads answer "no results" without a schema — fisher#332

`FisherDatabase.ReadWhenStorageExistsAsync` wraps the event store's diagnostic reads — progression,
high-water status, the head sequence, the timestamp floor, all three dead-letter reads — and
`Advanced.FetchEventStoreStatisticsAsync`, answering empty/`null`/`0` when the table or column does not
exist. Marten's marten#5512, ported. These are what a console calls on a timer, and the likeliest
reason one fails is that the schema has not been applied **yet** — the window before
`ApplyAllDatabaseChangesOnStartup()` runs, which is exactly when a console attaches.

- **Keyed on the exception, never on configuration**, because configuration cannot say whether the
  schema has been applied. `SqliteSchemaErrors` is the classifier: `SQLITE_ERROR` (1) plus the message,
  since SQLite has no dedicated code, and **"no such column" as well as "no such table"** — a table
  with an older column set is the case Marten actually met in production.
- **It replaced two call-site wrappers that caught bare `Exception`** (`HeadSequenceAsync` in the
  projection statuses and `TryReadMaxEventSequenceAsync` in `TryCreateUsage`). Those swallowed a genuine
  connection or corruption failure as readily as a missing table, and they did not generalise —
  `GetProjectionStatusesAsync` called `AllProjectionProgress` unprotected two lines away.
  `a_file_that_is_not_a_database_still_throws` is the half that pins the narrowing.
- **Outside the resilience pipeline**, so a missing table is not offered to a retry policy first, and
  **reads only**: a progression or dead-letter write that silently did nothing would be far worse than
  one that failed.
- `FetchHighWaterInputsAsync` is deliberately not wrapped — it is the daemon's poll loop rather than a
  monitoring read, and the daemon ensures the event tables before it starts (fisher#333).

### Flat-table projections

`Projections/Flattened/` — a `FlatTableProjection` writes into a plain relational table keyed on the
stream, through `Project<T>(map => …)` mappings (`Map`, `SetValue`, `Increment`, `Decrement`) and
`Delete<T>()`. Ported from Polecat's, which is the closest template; the mapping API and the column-map
shapes are its, and four things are not.

- **One `insert … on conflict … do update`, where Polecat emits a `MERGE`.** SQLite has had upsert
  syntax since 3.24, so the matched and not-matched branches are two clauses of one statement — which
  is also why a parameter appearing in both is bound once by name rather than duplicated. **An
  unqualified column on the right of the update assignment is the pre-update row**, which is what makes
  `"a" = "a" + @p1` an increment; `excluded."a"` would be the value the insert branch would have
  written. Polecat spells the same thing `target.[a]`.
- **The table is created by the migration, not lazily on first write.** Registering the projection puts
  a `FlatTableFeatureSchema` into the store's feature set, so `ApplyAllConfiguredChangesToDatabaseAsync`
  creates it with everything else and `AutoCreate.None` is honoured for free. Polecat issues a CREATE
  TABLE from inside its first apply, which works but routes around the store's schema policy.
- **The physical name folds the store's logical schema in, and is resolved in `DocumentStore`'s
  constructor** rather than in the projection's. SQLite has no schemas, so the prefix *is* the isolation
  boundary between two logical stores in one file — a flat table that kept the bare name would be
  silently shared by both. The projection's constructor cannot see the store, and the projection is
  usually registered in the same configuration lambda that sets `DatabaseSchemaName`, in either order,
  so the fold happens once the options are final. The `fi_` family prefix is *not* applied:
  `FisherTableNaming.UserTableName` exists precisely because that prefix marks a table Fisher owns the
  shape of, and a flat table's shape is the projection's. The rename needs `FlatTable : Table`, because
  `SchemaObjectBase.Identifier` has a protected setter and Weasel's `MoveToSchema` only changes the
  qualifier.
- **Rebuild teardown is told the table name directly.** `PublishedTypes()` is empty — a flat table's
  rows are not documents — so the mapped-type sweep in `TeardownExistingProjectionStateAsync` cannot see
  it, and `IPublishesTables` is what closes that. Without it a rebuild replays onto the rows the
  previous run left, which the compliance suite catches with a row the replay cannot recreate.

**A member-valued `Decrement` onto a row that does not exist yet inserts the *negated* value**
(fisher#183, over the jasperfx#773 ruling): the insert branch applies the event to an implicit zero
row, so a first event carrying 5 lands the column at -5. Put the other way, which is the form worth
holding onto: a decrement event must never leave a column higher than it found it. Fisher inserted the
parameter unchanged until this wave, so a stream whose first event was a decrement of 5 landed at +5.
Marten was the only store that had it right; Fisher, Polecat and the first cut of the lifted Weasel
DSL were the majority and the majority was the wrong side. **The by-column form still inserts 0** —
that half of jasperfx#773 is open, all four stores agree, and it is no longer symmetric with
`IncrementMap`, which moved to inserting 1 in marten#5341.

**Weasel has since caught up**: weasel#574 shipped the same negation in
`Weasel.Storage.Flattened.DecrementMemberMap` in **9.31.0**, so the shared DSL and Fisher now agree
and adopting the DSL would no longer cost fisher#183's fix. That was the reason to check before
deferring the adoption, and it is not the reason it stayed deferred — see below.

**The shared flat-table DSL (weasel#568/#569) is deliberately not adopted yet.** What Weasel lifted is
the mapping model plus an `IFlatTableSqlDialect` seam; what Fisher would have to move across it is
where the cost is, and none of it is mechanical. Its column maps are `internal` and render through
`SchemaUtils.QuoteName` directly rather than through a dialect's `Quote`/`Existing` context, so every
one of them is a rewrite rather than a swap; `FlatTable : Table` exists to fold the store's logical
schema into the physical name, which is Fisher's isolation boundary and has no counterpart in
`FlatTableStatementBuilder`; and `FlatTableFeatureSchema` puts the table in the store's migration
rather than creating it lazily, which is the divergence from Polecat this section opens with. Set
against a shared model Fisher already matches behaviourally, that is churn through a projection type
the compliance suite covers, for no behaviour change. Worth doing on its own node with the fisher#183
semantics pinned first, not as a rider.

The primary key holds a stream id, so it is TEXT and bound through the lowercase-canonical conversion —
the `SqliteGuidIdentification` trap, in the one place a flat table meets it. Bound any other way, the
second event on a stream inserts a second row instead of updating the first.

### The async daemon

The daemon itself is JasperFx's — coordinator, subscription agents, shard tracker, throttled and
resilient loaders, roughly 10,500 lines. **What Fisher supplies is the storage seam**, and that is
all of it:

| Piece | Where | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `IEventDatabase` | `Storage/FisherDatabase.EventDatabase.cs` | progress reads/writes, highest sequence, timestamp floor, non-stale wait |
| `FisherHighWaterDetector` | `Events/Daemon/` | how far it is safe to read |
| `FisherEventLoader` | `Events/Daemon/` | pages `fi_events` by sequence |
| `FisherProjectionBatch` | `Events/Daemon/` | one transaction of projection writes + the progression row |
| `IEventStore<IDocumentSession, IQuerySession>` | `DocumentStore.Daemon.cs` | shards, sessions, loaders, batches, progression bookkeeping |
| `FisherProjectionDaemon` | `Events/Daemon/` | a dozen lines closing `JasperFxAsyncDaemon<,,>` over Fisher's session pair |

Six things that are decisions rather than mechanics:

- **The high-water mark simply is `max(seq_id)`.** Marten and Polecat must distinguish the highest
  sequence *issued* from the highest safe to *read*, because a PostgreSQL sequence or SQL Server
  IDENTITY hands out numbers outside the transaction — a writer can hold 7 uncommitted while 8
  commits ahead of it. On SQLite one writer per file plus `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` means a transaction's
  sequences fully commit before the next writer allocates any, and a rollback returns the number
  (`sqlite_sequence` is an ordinary table and rolls back with it). So `DetectInSafeZone` has no separate
  answer to give. **Do not reintroduce gap-skipping** — it would guard a state that cannot occur.
  **The opt-out was audited rather than left asserted** (fisher#195), and it holds — but say what it
  buys precisely, because "committed sequences are contiguous" is stronger than what is true and is
  what sent one agent looking for a bug. The property is narrower and is exactly the one the daemon
  needs: **a sequence at or below the mark can never later become a committed row the daemon has not
  read.** Two facts give it — allocation happens only while the writer holds the file's one write lock,
  and `AUTOINCREMENT` never reissues a number.
  - **Contiguity itself is not unconditional, and that is not a gap.** Deleting events leaves permanent
    holes, and deleting the newest events drops `max(seq_id)` below a mark already recorded — which is
    what fisher#174 found. A hole is a sequence that is *gone*, not one that is *coming*: the loader
    pages a range rather than counting rows so it steps over one, and the mark cannot follow a fallen
    ceiling down because `HighWaterStatistics.HasChanged` is `CurrentMark > LastMark`.
    `DeleteAllEventDataAsync` — the one operation that empties the table outright — clears
    `fi_event_progression` in the same pass, so the two can never disagree.
  - ⚠️ **One reachable state would break it, and it is closed one repository away.** SQLite cannot
    alter most of a table, so any migration beyond `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN` rebuilds it, and a bare
    rebuild resets `sqlite_sequence` to the highest *surviving* row — reissuing, on a table whose newest
    rows had been deleted, numbers already handed out. Weasel's `TableDelta` emits the carry-over that
    prevents it. `high_water_contiguity_audit.a_table_rebuild_carries_the_autoincrement_counter_forward`
    pins the dependency, because nothing in Fisher would otherwise notice it going away and the symptom
    is a projection permanently missing events with nothing to say why.
  - **`high_water_contiguity_audit` is the argument as tests** — a crashed writer through WAL recovery
    (the database and its `-wal` copied out from under a live uncommitted transaction, which is what a
    machine that lost power would have on disk), WAL checkpointing, `VACUUM`, concurrent writers, two
    stores over one file, every deletion path, and the migration above.
- **Non-stale is decided against the shards the store *registers*, not the rows
  `fi_event_progression` holds** (fisher#102). Reading it off the rows makes a shard that has not run
  yet invisible — with no row it has no sequence to be behind — so a store with two async projections
  was declared non-stale the moment the first reached the head. It is a *window*, from one shard's
  first commit to the next shard's, which is why it surfaced as an intermittent
  `rebuild_and_catch_up_compliance` failure on a loaded two-core CI runner and never locally. Behind
  `QueryForNonStaleData` it tells an application its data is current while a projection has never run.
  Three consequences, each deliberate:
  - **A registered shard with no row is stale**, so a wait with no daemon running now times out rather
    than returning early. That is the honest answer, and the message names the shards that recorded
    nothing, because "never started" and "still catching up" are different operational situations.
  - **A store with no async projections returns immediately.** The same rule was broken the other way
    round: with events present and no rows, the old `shards.Length > 0` clause was false forever, so
    `QueryForNonStaleData` on a store with no async projections *always* threw `TimeoutException`.
  - **A row for a shard nothing registers is ignored.** A projection removed from configuration leaves
    an orphan row that will never advance again — `DeleteProjectionProgressByShardNameAsync` exists for
    exactly those — and waiting on one would hang every subsequent call.
  `one_shard_at_the_head_does_not_speak_for_a_shard_that_never_ran` is the discriminating fact, and it
  needs *two* registered shards: with no rows at all the old rule waited too, so a store where nothing
  has run cannot tell the two rules apart.
  **The correlation itself is `JasperFx.Events.Daemon.ProjectionLagCalculator`'s now, not Fisher's**
  (jasperfx#619). That type's xmldoc names Marten's `WaitForNonStaleDataAsync` as one of the three
  independent implementations of exactly this semantic that the lift exists to collapse, and Fisher's
  was the third — so this is the shared spelling of fisher#102's rule rather than a change to it.
  Adopting it also brings two rules Fisher's own version did not have: a progression row is only ever
  consulted at the shard's *current version*, and a row whose name does not parse as a shard identity
  is dropped rather than string-compared (marten#5161). `IEventDatabase.FetchProjectionLagAsync` is
  the shared read the same correlation backs, and Fisher inherits it as a default interface method —
  no implementation, and the numbers rather than the wait for a caller who wants them.
  - ⚠️ **The wait's bar stays `max(seq_id)`, not `ProjectionLag.HighWaterMark`**, so
    `HasProgressionRow` and `Sequence` are what it reads and `IsCaughtUp`/`Lag` deliberately are not.
    The calculator measures each cell against the *persisted high-water row*, which is right for a
    status endpoint — a shard cannot pass a mark the agent has not published — and wrong for this
    caller: a session that just committed is asking about its own events, which are at `max(seq_id)`
    and may sit above a mark the agent has not reached. On SQLite that ceiling is honest with no
    safe-zone reasoning behind it, since committed sequences are contiguous, so it is strictly
    stricter than the mark. `a_mark_that_trails_the_committed_events_does_not_make_the_store_current`
    is the discriminating fact — it asserts every cell reports `IsCaughtUp` and requires the wait to
    time out anyway, so swapping the check for `IsCaughtUp` fails it by returning.
- **The session's operation queue is guarded, because the daemon is not a single caller.** JasperFx's
  `ExecutionStage` fans its executions out with `Task.WhenAll` and they all queue onto the *same*
  Fisher session, so two projection slices can call `QueueOperation` at the same instant.
  `List<T>.Add` is not thread-safe and fails silently here — two concurrent adds can leave the count
  incremented once, so one slice's document write never reaches the batch, which then commits the
  progression row for a range whose documents were only partly written. **That was fisher#13**, and it
  presented as a multi-stream rebuild intermittently missing one slice's document. Note how closely it
  rhymes with fisher#12: same silent outcome, one layer up. `concurrent_operation_queueing` pins both
  the add and the take.
- **So is every other lazily-built field on the session, and that half was missed for a year.** The
  queue got a lock out of fisher#13 and the fields beside it kept their `??=`, which is a read, a
  branch and a write — so two slices arriving together each construct one and **one is silently
  discarded with everything recorded on it**. Two of them are on the write path a slice actually
  takes: `IStorageSession.Versions` is resolved by the numeric and optimistic storages while
  *constructing* an upsert, on the calling thread, and `_queryProvider` is resolved by `Query<T>()`,
  which is how a slice reads what it is about to fold into. A discarded version tracker means a later
  guarded write compares against a version the session no longer remembers reading — a spurious
  `ConcurrencyException` at best, a stale write accepted at worst. One layer down,
  `FisherVersionTracker`'s two `Dictionary<Type, object>` fields were mutated unguarded by
  `ForType`/`RevisionsFor`, which is the shape that loses an entry outright.
  **This is marten#4657/#4667 reached from the other side**: there, concurrent slices were handed
  separate sessions that *shared* a `VersionTracker`, an `ItemMap` and a `ChangeTrackers` list; here
  they share the session itself, which is a shorter route to the same place. `FisherSession.LazilyCreate`
  is the one place a lazily-built field is now created, and `concurrent_session_tracker_state` pins it
  — four of its five tests fail without the guards.
  **The tracker's *inner* dictionaries stay unguarded, deliberately**: they are handed to a storage
  operation, which writes into one during postprocessing, and postprocessing runs inside
  `ExecuteBatchAsync`, which is strictly sequential because SQLite takes one writer per file.
- **The batch must stay atomic.** It commits the projection's document writes *and* the progression
  row in one transaction. Splitting them lets a crash between them either replay events already
  applied or skip events never applied, permanently and with nothing to signal it. Sessions are
  collected rather than merged, and each flushes its own operations into the shared transaction,
  because an operation is configured against a session as its storage context and that is what
  carries tenancy.
- **The loader diverges from the stream reads on purpose.** Fisher's stream reads skip an
  unresolvable `dotnet_type` unconditionally so a deployment can still read events it does not know
  about; the daemon must not, because silently skipping one leaves the projection permanently wrong.
  It honours `SkipUnknownEvents` and otherwise throws `UnknownEventTypeException`, which implements
  JasperFx's `IEventFailureContext` so the shard failure can be classified without knowing Fisher's
  exception types.
  ⚠️ **The serialization half of that was missing entirely, and the flag governing it defaulted to
  true** (fisher#308). Fisher raised no `EventDeserializationFailureException` anywhere, so
  `SkipSerializationErrors` had nothing to catch: a body that would not parse escaped the loader as a
  bare `JsonException`, `ResilientEventLoader` wrapped it in `EventLoaderException` after its retries,
  and the shard paused as `ShardFailureCategory.Other` with no dead letter — a documented policy that
  was silently a no-op. `Fisher.Exceptions.EventDeserializationFailureException` subclasses the shared
  type (so the category, the sequence and `ToDeadLetterEvent` are the base's) and is raised from
  **`FisherEventsRowReader.ReadEventCore`**, the single hydration point every read path converges on —
  the same argument the upcasting hook makes one line above, and where Marten puts it too. Only the
  loader acts on the policy; everywhere else the gain is that the exception names the sequence and the
  event type instead of being whatever the serializer threw.
  - ⚠️ **A missing `IEventBinarySerializer` is resolved OUTSIDE that guard, deliberately.** It is a
    misconfiguration of the whole store rather than one unreadable row, so making it an
    `EventDeserializationFailureException` would let `SkipSerializationErrors` — on by default — turn
    every binary event in the store into a dead letter and bury the one thing worth saying.
    `RequireBinarySerializer` exists to be callable before the try; moving it back inside fails two
    tests, which is how the placement was verified.
  - ⚠️ **`UpcastingException` is excluded from the wrap for the same reason.** Upstream raises it in
    exactly two places and both are contract refusals rather than data failures — an async-only
    transformation reached synchronously, and a payload asked for an encoding it cannot supply, which
    is what Fisher's "a raw-JSON transformation cannot read a `data_binary` body" refusal is. Wrapping
    them was caught by `upcasting.a_raw_json_upcast_over_a_binary_body_is_refused_by_name`, which is
    the pre-existing guard for that refusal. A transformation's *own* exception is not an
    `UpcastingException` and is still wrapped, which is the failure the policy is actually for.
  - **Corrupting a body for a test means writing something that is not JSON at all.** A well-formed
    object with a mistyped member is liable to deserialize to a default-valued event instead of
    failing, because the serializer's naming policy decides which keys are read — which is how the
    first version of these tests passed against a store that raised nothing.
  **`Weasel.Storage.EventLoaderBase` (weasel#566) is not adopted yet, and that is a judgement rather
  than an oversight.** The base is well shaped for Fisher — the paging, skip accounting, ceiling
  calculation and cancellation translation are all there behind an `IEventPagingDialect` seam, and it
  carries `ReportLastObservedSequence` (jasperfx#667), which Fisher genuinely lacks: a full batch whose
  every row was skipped currently takes a ceiling from a page with no surviving event. What it would
  cost is a SQLite `IEventPagingDialect` (page SQL *and* the skip-ahead probe, which Fisher has no
  caller for), a mapping of the loader's constructor-time allow-list work onto `EventTypeAllowList` —
  including fisher#191's expansion of a transformation's *source* names, which is the half that fails
  silently if it is lost — and a home for the `DaemonTrace.Record` call, for which the base offers no
  hook. Worth its own node with fisher#153 and fisher#191 pinned first, since both are regressions the
  compliance suites structurally cannot catch.
- **The generic interface's `IEventDatabase` parameter carries the answer** (fisher#57), where for a
  long time every one of them was ignored on the true-enough grounds that a Fisher store was one file.
  Under database-per-tenant it is not, and ignoring it would read one tenant's events and write every
  tenant's documents from them. `DocumentStore.DatabaseFrom` is the single place that resolution
  happens; a null falls back to the default database, which is right for every store that is not
  database-per-tenant.
- **Rebuild teardown checks for the table in C#, not in SQL.** SQLite resolves a table name when it
  *prepares* a statement, so a `where exists (select 1 from sqlite_master ...)` guard on the delete
  fails before the guard runs. Names come back from `sqlite_master` first and missing tables are
  skipped. Both halves of teardown — progression and documents — run in one transaction, because
  clearing progress without clearing documents replays a projection on top of rows it already wrote.

- **The high-water agent re-stamps `last_updated` on an idle cycle, and that is the only liveness
  signal there is** (fisher#60, sibling of marten#5181). The mark's row moves when the mark
  *advances*, which is a different question from whether the loop is *running* — a quiet store
  advances nothing and would otherwise be indistinguishable from a dead daemon. **The extended
  progression `heartbeat` column does not answer it either**: JasperFx's `ExtendedProgressionWriter.OnNext`
  returns early for `ShardState.HighWaterMark`, so nothing ever writes it for that row, and a health
  check reading it looks like it has a signal it does not have. `a_running_daemon_never_writes_the_heartbeat_column`
  pins the premise against a daemon that has genuinely run, because Marten's equivalent tests passed
  for years by seeding the column with raw SQL.
  **Throttled where Marten's per-tenant equivalent writes on every cycle**, and that difference is
  SQLite's: a write takes the file's one write lock, so touching at `SlowPollingTime` would make an
  otherwise read-only store a permanent 1 Hz writer with a WAL to check point.
  `EventStoreOptions.HighWaterLivenessInterval` bounds it (five seconds; zero turns it off and leaves
  the health check on the gap heuristic alone).

**A non-stale timeout says what each lagging agent last reported** (fisher#329). The wait used to name
the lagging shard and add "the daemon may not be running" — which, in the one CI failure #329 has, sat
beside a sibling shard at the head: the daemon *was* running, and the only thing that could have told a
stalled shard from a slow one, the agent's own state, was discarded with its `NullLogger`.
`DescribeLaggingAgents` now appends each lagging shard's last `ShardState` from this database's tracker
— action, agent status, and a pause reason cut to its exception lines (the stack frames dropped, the
inner `--->` lines kept, since an apply failure arrives wrapped in `ApplyEventException`).
- **Read, never created.** `_tracker` is lazy, and a store with no daemon in this process has none; building
  one to ask it would invent an observation. That case keeps the old hint, and
  `with_no_daemon_in_this_process_the_hint_is_kept` pins it.
- ⚠️ **It diagnoses #329 rather than fixing it.** The stall is not reproduced — 99 of 100 local runs of
  the class were clean, and the hundredth was a failure the investigation caused itself (another loop
  deleting its files mid-run) — and the hypothesis it was checked
  against (a shard missing the one high-water publication on an idle store) does not survive
  `StartAllAsync` priming the mark before any agent starts (jasperfx#709). The next occurrence names its
  cause.

**The hosted service is the store's `IProjectionCoordinator`** (fisher#138). It registered only as an
`IHostedService` over an internal class implementing nothing else, so **both** documented routes to the
running daemon failed — the service was not resolvable, and the
`GetServices<IHostedService>().OfType<IProjectionCoordinator>()` fallback found nothing either. Marten
and Polecat have registered JasperFx's interface since jasperfx#430, so store-agnostic code could do
daemon operations against them and not against Fisher. **No shared suite covers this** — Fisher passed
all 37 suites throughout, which is jasperfx#732, the third instance of the pattern after jasperfx#700
and jasperfx#718.

- **JasperFx's interface, not a Fisher-local sub-interface.** Both siblings have a local one that adds
  no members; theirs are historical (Marten's predates the lift, Polecat copied it) and a
  store-agnostic consumer resolves the shared one anyway. Nothing new lands on Fisher's public API.
- **No `ProjectionCoordinatorBase`.** The siblings close over it for leadership election across nodes;
  Fisher refuses `HotCold` outright, so what is left of a coordinator here is the daemon cache and the
  pause/resume pair, which this class already had in all but name.
- **One instance, registered as the coordinator and resolved from there as the hosted service.**
  Registering them separately would run two daemons over one file — two writers contending for one
  write lock, which is the thing `_running` exists to prevent.
- **`StartAsync` had to learn to resume**, and this is the non-obvious half. It only ever called
  `StartAnyNewDaemonsAsync`, which *skips* a database already in `_running` — so after a pause it
  would have started nothing at all. It now restarts agents on the daemons it holds first, which makes
  a second `StartAsync` equivalent to `PauseAsync` + `StartAsync`, the property JasperFx's own
  coordinator base establishes and the one `ResumeAsync` rests on.
- **Pausing stops the tenant poller too.** It builds and starts daemons of its own, so leaving it
  running would let a tenant appearing mid-pause quietly begin projecting; "paused" has to mean paused
  for tenants that do not exist yet.
- **An ancillary store gets `IProjectionCoordinator<T>` and not the unmarked one**, so resolving
  `IProjectionCoordinator` is never ambiguous about whose daemons come back.

**`Advanced.ResetAllDataAsync` pauses a hosted daemon around the wipe, and that is a deliberate
divergence from Marten**, which leaves its daemon alone. The wipe deletes `fi_event_progression` out
from under agents holding their positions in memory: they carry on from where they were, record nothing
against an event store that now starts at zero, and every later `WaitForNonStaleData` times out naming
shards that recorded no progress. Silent until something waits.

- **The reason to diverge is that the alternative was unreachable rather than merely manual.** Until
  the coordinator existed there was no handle on the running daemon, so the caller this method
  overwhelmingly has — a spec fixture resetting between scenarios — could not have paused it by hand.
- **`DocumentStore.RunningDaemons` is the seam**, set by the hosted service on start and cleared on
  stop, because `Advanced` reaches the store and not the container. It is a claim about *right now*
  rather than about registration, and it is deliberately not a general escape hatch — application code
  resolves `IProjectionCoordinator` from DI, which is the store-agnostic route.
  **Unwrapped through `SecondaryStoreProxy`**, or an ancillary store — which arrives as its marker
  proxy rather than as a `DocumentStore` — would silently get the old behaviour.
- **The resume is in a `finally`.** A half-done wipe with the daemon left paused is the worse of the
  two failures: the caller sees the exception either way, and a daemon that never resumes turns one
  failed reset into every subsequent projection silently not running.
- **Only a daemon this process hosts is paused.** `ExternallyManaged`, a hand-built store, or another
  process all keep the hazard, which is the honest outcome since nothing here can reach them.
- `a_reset_leaves_the_running_daemon_able_to_project_again` needs **two rounds** — the first
  establishes real in-memory positions to be stranded, and a single-round test passes against the old
  behaviour. Verified by reverting: it fails with the reported `TimeoutException` verbatim.

WAL is what lets the daemon read while a session writes. It is on by default via
`SqlitePragmaSettings.Default`; `BuildProjectionDaemonAsync` warns when it is not, because without it
the daemon and every writer serialize against each other and that presents as a slow projection
rather than as a misconfiguration.

### Event-emitting async projections

JasperFx's `EventSlice.BuildOperations` drives three synchronous members on the projection batch —
`QuickAppendEventWithVersion`, `UpdateStreamVersion`, `QuickAppendEvents`. **All three do the same
thing in Fisher: record the `StreamAction` and let `ExecuteAsync` plan it inside the transaction.**

That is a deliberate divergence from Marten, which queues three different storage operations. Two
reasons, both SQLite-shaped:

- **The version has to come from a read under the write lock.** The slice pre-assigns versions
  client-side from its own event count, which is only the stream's version when the projection has
  seen every event on it. Fisher's `AppendPlanner` re-reads inside the batch's `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` and
  the optimistic guard runs there, so a projection raising events onto a stream another writer has
  moved on fails the batch instead of writing a wrong version.
- **Tags need the trailing sequence read-back.** Routing raised events through
  `FisherQuickAppendEventsOperation` is the only thing that supplies the `seq_id` a tag row is keyed
  by. Queuing Weasel's bare per-event operations would silently make raised events untaggable.

Funnelling all three members into one list works because the `StreamAction` JasperFx hands over
already carries every raised event, and the single-stream-start path passes the *same* action
instance to each call — reference identity is what dedupes them.

**Polecat no-ops these three rather than throwing**, so an event-raising projection there drops its
events with no signal. Do not copy that.

### Composite projections

`Projections.CompositeProjectionFor(name, composite => …)` (fisher#19) — several projections as ordered
stages under one shard, rebuilt together in one pass. The issue guessed this would be close to free and
it nearly was: `FisherCompositeProjection` closes JasperFx's `CompositeProjection<,>` over Fisher's
session pair, and `CompositeIProjectionSource` (ported from Polecat) presents a bare `IProjection` as
something a stage can hold.

**What a composite buys, precisely: ordered execution in one batch and one rebuild pass.** It does
*not* let a later stage read an earlier stage's writes with `LoadAsync` — the whole composite commits
as one batch, so nothing an earlier stage queued is in the database yet. JasperFx's mechanism for
sharing across stages is the **aggregate cache** (`CompactCachesAsync` runs once at the composite
boundary rather than per stage, precisely so downstream stages can read upstream in-flight entities),
which aggregation projections participate in and a bare `IProjection` does not. A first version of
`composite_projections` assumed the database-read model and failed; the test now says so explicitly, so
the next reader does not have to rediscover it.

- **Composites are always asynchronous.** A stage boundary only means something inside a daemon batch;
  an inline composite would be a boundary with nothing on either side of it.
- **The child projections' event types are registered on the event graph by
  `CompositeProjectionFor`**, not by each child — a child inside a composite is never registered on its
  own and would otherwise contribute nothing to what the store knows how to deserialize.
- **`CompositeIProjectionSource`'s execution does not dispose the batch it is handed.** Every stage
  writes into one batch so the composite commits together; a stage disposing it would commit the
  earlier stages and leave the later ones writing into a disposed session.
- A document a bare `IProjection` stores still needs a registered mapping, since Fisher only creates
  tables for types the schema has mapped. That is the ordinary on-demand rule, not a composite quirk.
- **A member held by the wrapper has to be asked what it publishes, or a rebuild replays onto its
  surviving rows** (fisher#63, sibling of marten#5175). `CompositeProjection.PublishedTypes()` walks
  its stages' members, and `CompositeIProjectionSource` was constructed with a fresh, empty
  `AsyncOptions` and never told what the projection inside it writes — so teardown saw the wrapper and
  enumerated nothing, while the progression rows were deleted anyway. It now adopts a `ProjectionBase`
  projection's options and published types, exactly as JasperFx's own `ProjectionWrapper` does.
  **`Name` and `Version` are deliberately not adopted**: they compose the member's shard identity, and
  changing them orphans every progression row already written.
- **A raw `IProjection` that is not a `ProjectionBase` declares nothing, and the composite cannot
  invent it** — `Add(projection, options => options.DeleteViewTypeOnTeardown<T>())` is where that is
  said. Its rows otherwise survive a rebuild, which is pinned as a decision rather than left to look
  like the bug above.
- **The composite's own `Options` are its own, and were being dropped.** JasperFx's override returns
  the stages' types and therefore loses the `Options.StorageTypes` the base would have contributed, so
  `composite.Options.DeleteViewTypeOnTeardown<T>()` was a silent no-op;
  `FisherCompositeProjection.PublishedTypes()` puts them back.
- **An ordinary rebuild test cannot catch any of this.** A replay rewrites every row it can still
  produce, so a surviving row is invisible except where the replay *cannot* recreate it —
  `composite_member_teardown` plants one against an id no event mentions. Same discipline the
  flat-table (`IPublishesTables`) and EF Core teardowns each had to learn.

### Subscriptions

`Projections.Subscribe(subscription)` (fisher#21) — a daemon shard that hands each range of events to
arbitrary user code rather than to a projection. `Subscriptions/ISubscription.cs` carries the
interface, a `SubscriptionBase` closing JasperFx's `JasperFxSubscriptionBase` over Fisher's session
pair, and the wrapper that presents a bare `ISubscription` as one; `DocumentStore.Daemon.cs`
implements `ISubscriptionRunner<ISubscription>`.

- **`SubscriptionExecution<T>` resolves the runner with a soft `storage as ISubscriptionRunner<T>`
  cast.** Not implementing it is not a compile error — it throws when a subscription is registered,
  which is why subscriptions read as *absent* rather than broken before this. The `storage` argument
  is the **store**, not the database: JasperFx has two `BuildExecution` overloads and the one the
  daemon reaches passes `_store`.
- **The subscription's session is the batch's**, taken from `SessionForTenant`, which both opens it
  and enrols it. So a subscription's own writes commit in the same transaction as the progression
  row: it cannot advance past a range whose writes rolled back, nor commit writes for a range it will
  replay. **That guarantee stops at Fisher's database** — an HTTP call or a bus publish is
  at-least-once and nothing can make it atomic with a SQLite commit.
- **The post-commit listener runs after `ExecuteAsync` returns, outside the resilience pipeline.** A
  retried `SQLITE_BUSY` re-executes the whole batch delegate, so a listener invoked inside it fires
  twice for a transaction that already committed — the property fisher#4 established for the outbox
  and fisher#12 for the batch's own input.
- **`IDaemonChangeListener` is JasperFx's, not a Fisher type.** It was lifted out of Polecat as the
  canonical shape, so Polecat's local `IChangeListener` is the older spelling of the same thing; new
  code should not copy it.
- **There is no inline equivalent**, deliberately: "inline" would just be code in the caller's own
  unit of work. A subscription needs the daemon running — `AddAsyncDaemon()` hosts it with everything
  else.
- ⚠️ **Fisher's daemon is built with an `ILogger`, never an `ILoggerFactory`, and that turned out to
  matter.** jasperfx#827 (fixed in 2.69.1) was `JasperFxSubscriptionBase.BuildExecution`'s two
  overloads disagreeing: the `ILoggerFactory` one passed the *database* where
  `SubscriptionExecution<T>` resolves its `ISubscriptionRunner<T>` off the *store*, so construction
  threw and **no subscription could start on that path, on any store**.
  `JasperFxAsyncDaemon.buildAgentForShard` takes it whenever the daemon was built with a factory —
  which is the hosted path everywhere except here, because `FisherDaemonHostedService` calls
  `BuildProjectionDaemonsAsync(_logger)`. **Verified rather than assumed**: the regression test was run
  against the 2.69.0 pin and passed.
  - **What was missing was the coverage, not the behaviour.** Every subscription test built its daemon
    by hand, and so does `SubscriptionCompliance` — which is why nothing on any store exercised the
    other overload. `subscriptions_under_the_hosted_daemon` is the fact that a subscription runs under
    `AddAsyncDaemon()` at all, and it is what would catch Fisher if the daemon ever moved to the
    logger-factory constructor.

One test-shaped trap worth recording, because it presented as an intermittent: **`WaitForNonStale`
does not imply the post-commit listener has run.** The progression row is written *inside* the batch's
transaction, so non-stale is true the moment that commits — strictly before the listener. A test that
waits on non-staleness and then asserts the listener fired fails roughly one full-suite run in
several. Wait on the listener's own signal.

### Projection side effects

`IMessageOutbox` vends an `IMessageBatch` per unit of work; a projection's `PublishMessage` buffers
into it, and the batch flushes in whichever hook its delivery guarantee needs. Both of Fisher's commit
paths bracket their transaction the same way — `FisherSession.SaveChangesAsync` and
`FisherProjectionBatch.ExecuteAsync` each call `BeforeCommitAsync` as the last thing inside the
transaction and `AfterCommitAsync` after it commits. Type names match Polecat's exactly, because
messaging is not dialect-specific and projection code should port between the stores unchanged.

- **`NulloMessageOutbox` is the intended end state, not a placeholder** (fisher#8, closed wontfix).
  It drops messages rather than throwing, which is the sibling behaviour: publishing means something
  only once a bus is wired in, and a store that threw would make every projection that *might* publish
  untestable without one. **Fisher will not ship a delivery mechanism of its own.** Marten and Polecat
  both delegate to Wolverine and the seam is what a bus integration plugs into; a second answer here
  would be a Fisher-only subsystem — retry policy, poison handling, drainer coordination — that
  projection code could not port to the siblings. So "a published side effect goes nowhere until an
  `IMessageOutbox` is supplied" is a stated contract, and should be documented as one rather than
  filed as a gap.
- **The batch is created lazily and never reused across units of work.** A session that publishes
  nothing never asks the outbox for one, so both hooks stay no-ops for the common case; and clearing
  it after commit is what stops a second `SaveChangesAsync` re-flushing the first one's messages.
- **`AfterCommitAsync` runs outside the resilience pipeline** in the projection batch. A retried
  `SQLITE_BUSY` re-executes the whole delegate, so a post-commit publish inside it would fire twice
  for a transaction that had already committed.
- **The same property bit the batch's own input, and that one was silent** (fisher#12). Everything
  the retried delegate reads has to survive being read twice, so the session's operations are taken
  *before* the pipeline (`TakePendingOperations`) and executed from that snapshot inside it. Draining
  them inside — which is what `FlushOperationsAsync` used to do — left a retry with nothing to write
  while the progression row still committed, advancing a projection past events whose documents were
  never written, with no error anywhere.
- Hook *order* is not the invariant — both hooks would fire in order even if both ran before the
  commit. What is pinned is what the rest of the database can see when each runs, probed over a
  separate connection: invisible at `BeforeCommit`, visible at `AfterCommit`. Verified by moving the
  call, in both paths.

⚠️ **A daemon test of these hooks must wait on the hook's own signal, never on non-staleness**
(fisher#232). The progression row is written *inside* the batch's transaction and `AfterCommitAsync`
runs after it commits, so non-stale becomes true strictly first — a test that waits on it and then
asserts the after-hook fired is a real intermittent, roughly one full-suite run in several. This is
the same trap recorded under "Subscriptions" for the post-commit listener, one seam over, and it was
not revisited there when that was learned. `RecordingOutbox.AfterCommitted` is the signal; making the
hook take 500 ms turns the race deterministic, which is how the fix was verified rather than by
re-running and hoping.

`IProjectionBatch.PublishMessageAsync` hands over an `object`, but `IMessageSink.PublishAsync<T>` is
generic, so `MessagePublishing` closes it over the runtime message type and caches the compiled
delegate per type. Polecat does the same via polecat#46, with `FastExpressionCompiler` where Fisher
uses the BCL's `Expression.Compile` — not worth a dependency for one call site.

### Event rewriting

`Events/Protected/` — three operations that mutate events already committed, and the foundation both
event data masking (fisher#9) and stream compacting (fisher#10) are clients of. Ported from Polecat's
`Events/Protected/`, which is the same three.

- `OverwriteEventOperation` rewrites what an event **says**: `data`, plus `headers` where the store
  keeps them. Everything placing the row in the stream and in the global order is untouched.
- `ReplaceEventOperation` rewrites what an event **is**: `data`, `type`, `dotnet_type` and a fresh
  `id`, because it is no longer the event that was appended. Stream, version and sequence stay, and
  the row's **tag rows are deleted** — a tag describes the event that was appended, so carrying it
  over would let a tag query return the replacement as though it were the tagged event.
- `DeleteEventsOperation` removes rows by sequence.

All three queue onto the session, so a rewrite commits in the same transaction as everything else —
which is what lets masking rewrite a batch atomically. Four decisions in them:

- **The row is matched by `seq_id`, never by `id`.** The sequence is the primary key; `id` has no
  index, so matching on it would turn every rewrite into a table scan.
- **`ReplaceEventOperation` does not move the timestamp, where Polecat's does.** `fi_events.timestamp`
  is what `FetchStreamAsync`'s timestamp bound and the daemon's timestamp floor read, and both assume
  it rises with the sequence. Moving one row's timestamp forward puts the column out of order with
  `seq_id`, and a bounded read then returns a set that is neither the old answer nor the new one.
  Polecat can afford it because its timestamp column is not load-bearing in the same way.
- **`DeleteEventsOperation` clears tag rows before events.** `fi_event_tag_*` has a real foreign key
  to `fi_events(seq_id)` and Weasel's default profile enforces it, so the other order fails with
  `FOREIGN KEY constraint failed` — the same ordering `DeleteAllEventDataAsync` learned in fisher#6.
  `deleting_a_tagged_event_clears_its_tag_rows_first` fails with that exact error if the two are
  swapped, which was verified by swapping them. Dead letters are deliberately left alone: they have no
  foreign key precisely so they outlive the events they describe.
- **Deleting is safe only because `seq_id` is `AUTOINCREMENT`.** A bare `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY` aliases
  the rowid, which SQLite reuses after a delete, and a reused sequence below the daemon's high-water
  mark is an event no async projection would ever see. This is the operation that would otherwise have
  discovered that the hard way.

**None of it reaches an async projection that has already run.** The high-water mark is a sequence and
a rewrite does not move it, so a shard past the event never reads the new body and a projection
holding state derived from the old one stays wrong until it is rebuilt. Marten behaves the same way,
and it is why masking is a data-at-rest operation rather than a correction. Anything built on these
has to say so rather than leave it implicit.

`DeleteEvents` is internal: the safe uses of "delete these events" all go through a higher-level
operation that decides what replaces them, so there is no public surface for it.

### Stream compacting

`Events/Protected/StreamCompacting.cs` (fisher#10) — replaces a stream's events with a single
`Compacted<T>` event carrying the aggregate state. Reached by `session.Events.CompactStreamAsync<T>`,
and by `IEventStore.CompactStreamAsync` for tooling. Ported from Polecat's, which is the request
shape's other consumer.

**Reading it back needed nothing.** JasperFx's aggregator calls `Compacted<T>.MaybeFastForward` before
folding, so a stream starting with a snapshot event starts from that state and applies only what
follows — live aggregation, `FetchForWriting` and the daemon all inherit it.

- **The snapshot takes the last event's row**, so the stream's version does not move and the next
  append carries on from where it would have. The events below it are deleted.
- **The fetch is outside the write transaction, and that is safe** — which is worth stating because
  fisher#10 assumed the opposite. Compacting only touches events at or below a version it observed and
  an append only adds above one, so the two cannot overlap; two concurrent compactions of the same
  stream either write the same snapshot to the same row or find the target already gone and update
  nothing. There is no lost update to prevent, so there is no version guard — adding one would be
  theatre.
- **An aggregate that folds to null leaves the stream alone.** A stream deleted by its own
  `ShouldDelete` has no state to snapshot, and writing `Compacted<T>(null)` would be worse than doing
  nothing.
- **The tag rows of every compacted event go**, including the replaced one — see the replace operation
  above. Keeping the last event's tag while deleting the rest is the one outcome that is neither "the
  stream is still tagged" nor "the tagged events are gone".
- **`IEventStore.CompactStreamAsync` resolves the aggregate type from `fi_streams`**, where Polecat
  throws at that level despite implementing the generic overload. The type is on the row, so declining
  for every stream would be a worse answer than declining for the streams that genuinely record none —
  and that message names the generic overload.
- **The tenant-aware pair (jasperfx#910, fisher#354) opens the session for the tenant**, for both the
  stream-state read and the compaction — the action-side twin of `OpenReadOnlyEventStore(tenantId)`,
  whose selection was useless while the action one call later ran in the default scope. A tenant on a
  store that is not multi-tenanted is refused by the reader's rule, not ignored.

Compacting is **one-way**: a projection rebuilt afterwards rebuilds from the snapshot rather than from
the history that produced it. `StreamCompactingRequest<T>.Archiver` is the hook for copying the events
somewhere first, and it runs before anything destructive is queued.

### Event data masking

`Advanced.ApplyEventDataMaskingAsync(...)` (fisher#9) — GDPR-style erasure, rewriting protected
information out of events already stored. JasperFx 2.41.0 lifted the *request* shape
(`IEventDataMasking`) because Marten's and Polecat's were identical; **the rule registry was not
lifted**, so `EventGraph.Masking.cs` is a port of Polecat's rather than a use of something shared.

The whole batch runs in one session, so an erasure is either done or not done — a partial one is a
compliance answer that is neither.

- **The two masking overloads do not have the same reach, and that falls out of the type system.**
  `ActionMasker` tests `@event is IEvent<T>` and `IEvent<out T>` is covariant, so an `Action` rule
  registered against an interface or base class reaches every event body implementing it. `FuncMasker`
  has to *assign* the replacement back and only the closed `Event<T>` exposes a setter, so a `Func`
  rule matches its exact type only. A `record` needs the `Func` overload (a `with` expression makes a
  new instance); a hierarchy-wide rule therefore has to be the mutating one.
- **`IncludeEvents` is the only selector translated to SQL.** The two `IncludeStream` filter overloads
  take `Func<IEvent, bool>` and are applied in memory to an already-fetched stream; `IncludeEvents`
  takes an `Expression`. That asymmetry is the interface's, not Fisher's — the parameter types say so.
  It runs through `EventOperations.QueryEventsAsync`, which is the same `WhereClauseParser` +
  `EventMemberFactory` pair `AssignTagWhere` uses. Marten spells that `QueryAllRawEvents()` and returns
  an `IQueryable<IEvent>`; Fisher takes a predicate, because its LINQ provider is built over document
  storage and an `IEvent` queryable would need a parallel provider to serve one caller.
- **An event is rewritten only when a rule matched it**, and headers follow the same gate — so
  `AddHeader` marks the events that were masked, not the events that were looked at.
- **The same event reached by two sources is masked once**, deduplicated by sequence.
  `an_event_reached_by_two_sources_is_masked_once` pins it with a deliberately non-idempotent rule,
  because an idempotent one would agree either way.
- **A batch naming no stream and no filter throws** rather than masking everything.

**Masking does not reach anything derived from the events.** The daemon's high-water mark is a
sequence and masking does not move it, so a projection that already folded the unmasked body keeps
what it derived — a snapshot, document or flat table holding the protected information still holds it
until that projection is rebuilt. Marten is the same, and this is why masking is a data-at-rest
operation rather than a correction. `masking_does_not_reach_a_snapshot_already_written` pins it as
documented behaviour rather than leaving it to be rediscovered as a bug.

### Dead letters

`fi_dead_letters` holds one row per event a shard could not apply and was configured to skip, with
`DeadLetterEvent`'s columns one for one so CritterWatch reads Fisher's the same way it reads
Marten's. Three decisions in it:

- **No foreign key to `fi_events`, deliberately** — the opposite of the tag tables. A tag is
  meaningless without its event; a dead letter is the record that something went wrong and has to
  survive the event being archived, compacted or cleaned away. A cascade would erase the evidence
  somebody came looking for. Nothing else removes them either, which is why
  `DeleteAllEventDataAsync` does.
- **The write goes on its own connection, outside the failing batch's transaction.** That batch is
  about to roll back; a dead letter written inside it would roll back with the very failure it is
  recording, and the shard would skip the event leaving no trace. The `storage` parameter the daemon
  offers as a session context is therefore ignored.
- **It is an upsert, not an insert.** JasperFx assigns the version-7 id at construction and the
  daemon retries the write in the background, so a retry landing after a successful first attempt
  carries the same primary key.
- **`FetchDeadLetterCountsAsync(tenantId)` is overridden** (fisher#77), where without it the call lands
  on JasperFx's default and *throws* `NotSupportedException` for a non-null tenant while the
  store-global overload beside it works — which a monitoring console meets as soon as it renders
  per-tenant badges. Cheap because the table is store-global and records the failing event's tenant as
  an ordinary data column, so it is the same query with a `where tenant_id = …` rather than a second
  shape. **A null tenant stays store-global and leaves `TenantId` null** rather than defaulting it, so
  a consumer keying by `{ProjectionName}:{ShardKey}` can tell "every tenant" from "the default
  tenant" — and rows the daemon recorded with no tenant are counted there and reachable from no
  tenant-scoped read, which is the honest answer for them.
- **A `DeadLetterEvent` is refused as a document**, in `DocumentSchema.MappingFor`. On both siblings it
  is *also* an ordinary document, so `session.Store(deadLetterEvent)` lands it in the very table
  `QueryDeadLetterEventsAsync` reads; here it is infrastructure with its own table and its own write
  path, so the same call compiled, succeeded, wrote a `fi_doc_deadletterevent` row and the query never
  saw it. **Fisher's arrangement is the better one and the divergence is still worth failing over**,
  because it is silent in the direction that hurts: ported code keeps working and quietly stops
  recording anything. The guard sits on the mapping rather than on `Store`, because every path into
  document storage — write, query, load, an explicit `Schema.For<T>()` — resolves a mapping first, so
  one guard covers all of them and cannot be reached around.

Ordering matters when clearing event data, and it is why `DeleteAllEventDataAsync` uses an ordered
pass rather than the cleaner's unordered one: `fi_event_tag_*` rows have a real foreign key to
`fi_events(seq_id)` and Weasel's default profile turns enforcement on, so clearing events first fails
with `FOREIGN KEY constraint failed` (fisher#6). Tags go first, dead letters last.

### Document storage layout

Weasel.Storage supplies the selectors and the write operations but **not** an
`IDocumentStorage<T,TId>` implementation to hold them together — Marten and Polecat each write their
own, and `FisherDocumentStorage<TDoc,TId>` is Fisher's. Around it:

- `DocumentProviderRegistry` (`IProviderGraph`) caches one `DocumentProvider<T>` per document type,
  holding all four flavors. Which one a session resolves is `SessionOptions.Tracking`'s answer — see
  "Session tracking".
- **Storages record; the session queues.** `IStorageSession` has no operation queue, so
  `IDocumentStorage.Store` only assigns an identity and registers the document; `FisherSession.Store<T>`
  queues the `Upsert`. A storage that tried to enqueue would have to know a concrete session type.
- The document is serialized when the batch runs, not when `Store` is called, so mutating it in
  between still takes effect — matching Marten.
- The read layout is a contract with the shared selectors: writeable flavors read `id` at column 0 and
  `data` at 1 with metadata from 2; the query-only selectors omit `id` and read `data` at 0.

### Document write SQL

`SqliteDocumentStorageDescriptorBuilder` emits four statements whose **column order and `?` order are
one contract**, because the shared closed-shape operations bind by position. Two different orders are
in play, and they are not the same:

- upsert / insert / overwrite — `[tenant,] id, data, client-side binders`, then the optional
  concurrency guard (`ClosedShapeUpsertOperation.BindPreOnConflictParameters`)
- update — `data, client-side binders, id, [tenant]`, then the guard. **The id moves from the front
  to the back**, because it is a `WHERE` term rather than a value.

A server-side binder contributes a column and an expression but no parameter mark, which is what lets
`last_modified` sit in the middle of the column list without shifting a slot. That holds only while
its `ValueSql` contains no `?`.

Verified against SQLite 3.51 before anything was built on it: `ON CONFLICT … DO UPDATE SET … WHERE …
RETURNING id` parses, and when the guard does not match it returns **no row** and leaves the row
untouched — which is exactly what the Optimistic operation's postprocessing reads as a concurrency
failure. The `DO UPDATE SET` clause assigns from `excluded.*` for every column rather than repeating
each binder's `ValueSql`, so the update branch cannot drift from the insert branch.

### Tenant scoping in LINQ, and the marker operators

**fisher#51 was a cross-tenant read.** The tenant filter was applied by wrapping each caller predicate
through `IDocumentStorage.FilterDocuments`, so a query with *no* `Where` got no tenant term at all —
`Query<T>()` on a conjoined type returned every tenant's rows. Silent, and asymmetric in the way that
makes it hard to spot: the tenant owning most of the data sees a correct-looking answer with extras,
and a tenant with none sees somebody else's.

**It is the same mistake `ApplyHierarchyFilter` already documents**, whose comment names both halves —
composing a filter into `FilterDocuments` repeats it per predicate *and omits it from a query with
none*. fisher#17 learned that for the `doc_type` discriminator and fixed it there; the tenant filter
had the identical shape and was not revisited. All three implicit filters — tenant, hierarchy, soft
delete — are now one statement-level pass each, so no query shape can drop one. Do not fold any of
them back into a per-predicate wrapper.

Nothing caught it because `ConjoinedEventTenancyCompliance` covers the *event* store, Fisher's own
document tests were single-tenant, and `LoadAsync`/`LoadManyAsync` bake the tenant term into SQL built
once in the storage's constructor — so the bug was confined to the one path that composed it per
predicate. `tenanted_queries` now checks every statement shape in **both** directions.

**There is a shared suite for it now — `DocumentConjoinedTenancyCompliance` (jasperfx#898) — and what
took so long is worth knowing.** The event side has had twelve tenanted facts since 2.45.0 while
`DocumentComplianceConfig` carried no tenancy seam at all, so `DocumentSearchCompliance` cites
fisher#285 (Fisher's own search path ignoring conjoined tenancy) as a reason to exist and then
configures no tenancy. Two things give its facts teeth that no earlier tenanted fact in the library had,
and both are worth copying into any local tenancy test: **every fact reuses one document id across two
tenants**, because a store keying on id alone does not fail loudly but folds the two writes into one
row — distinct ids per tenant, which is what the library used before, passes cleanly on exactly that
store; and **every fact checks both directions**, because a leaking store still answers correctly for
whichever tenant owns the data. Fisher passes it on the pass described above, with no change to the
filter; what it needed was the *route* — see the covariance note under the document contract.

Being its own pass is also what `AnyTenant()` and `TenantIsOneOf(...)` need: they *replace* the term,
which is impossible while it is welded to each predicate. Both are refused against a type that is not
`MultiTenanted()`, because there is no column to have an opinion about — the same rule the soft-delete
operators follow.

The rest of fisher#26's operators:

- **`IsOneOf` / `In`** produce the same `in (…)` as `EnumerableContains`, reached from the other
  direction — there the collection is the receiver, here the member is.
- **`IsEmpty()` has to test null as well as length.** `json_extract` yields SQL NULL for an absent key
  and `json_array_length(null)` is NULL rather than 0, so a bare `= 0` leaves the row out instead of
  matching. A caller asking "is this empty" means "is there anything in it", and "the key is not
  there" is an honest yes.
- **`ModifiedSince` / `ModifiedBefore`** compare `last_modified` as text with no `strftime` wrapper,
  because the column already holds `SqliteTimestamp`'s fixed-width UTC form — the same asymmetry as
  `DeletedSince` / `DeletedBefore`, and for the same reason. **`CreatedSince` / `CreatedBefore` are
  deliberately absent**: there is no `created_at` column to answer from (fisher#29), and answering from
  `last_modified` would be a different question asked with a straight face.
- **`QueryForNonStaleData` waits for the whole store**, where Polecat waits for the projections feeding
  the queried type. Stricter rather than weaker, and it needs no type-to-shard map. It is a wait, not
  SQL, so it hangs off `Statement.NonStaleTimeout` and is read through `EffectiveNonStaleTimeout`,
  which walks the subquery chain — that way wrapping a statement for a count, a page, an aggregate or a
  reversal carries it without each wrap site having to remember.

One test-shaped lesson worth keeping: `modified_since_and_before` first took its boundary from
`DateTimeOffset.UtcNow` between two writes. It failed once and then passed on every rerun, which is the
worst possible signal. `last_modified` is written by SQLite's `strftime('now')`, so a client-sampled
bound compares two clocks that are only incidentally the same one. The test now reads the stored value
back — removing the question rather than widening the window and hoping.

### LINQ projections

`Select`, `Distinct` and `DistinctBy` (fisher#23). Before this every query materialised the whole
`data` column and deserialized it, so `Select(x => x.Name)` over a table of large documents was the
difference between reading one JSON scalar per row and reading every document — and Fisher refused it
rather than answering it expensively, which left the caller with only the expensive shape.

**`SelectProjection` rewrites rather than interprets.** Every document member reachable in the lambda
body is collected and replaced by an indexer into an `object?[]` of values read from the row; the
rewritten body is compiled once. So the *shape* of the projection — anonymous type, constructor,
object initialiser, interpolation, arithmetic — is whatever C# already allowed and none of it needs
translating.

- **Only member accesses become columns; everything around them runs in .NET, per row.** That is the
  boundary, and it is deliberate: `Select(x => x.First + " " + x.Last)` reads two columns and
  concatenates client-side. Marten's answer is the same, and it keeps the surface honest — there is no
  set of expressions that silently falls back to reading whole documents.
- Members are deduplicated by locator, so `new { A = x.N, B = x.N * 2 }` selects `n` once.
  `repeated_members_are_selected_once` asserts on the analyzer directly, because the *result* is
  identical either way — two columns holding the same value compute the same answer while reading
  twice as much.
- **Projected values go through the same `CoerceTo` as an aggregate's**, so an enum, a timestamp and a
  Guid convert the way fisher#22 established rather than through `Convert.ChangeType`.

**The provider had to split source type from result type.** A projection makes the queryable's element
type diverge from the document's — `Query<Catch>().Select(x => x.Species)` is an `IQueryable<string>` —
so the terminals can no longer take the document type from their own type parameter. `SourceTypeFor`
walks to the root `ConstantExpression`, which holds the original `FisherQueryable<T>`, and
`BuildStatement` is non-generic so one path serves both. `ToListAsync`, `FirstAsync`, `LastAsync`,
`CountAsync` and `AnyAsync` all handle a projected query; a projected `CountAsync` wraps rather than
replacing the select list, because `count(*)` over `select distinct …` is the only shape that answers
"how many distinct values".

Three restrictions, each refused by name:

- **`Distinct()` requires a `Select`.** Over whole documents DISTINCT compares serialized JSON byte
  for byte, so two documents equal in every member but written with different serializer settings, or
  with members in a different order, count as distinct. It would look right on small test data.
  `DistinctBy` is the operator for documents.
- **`DistinctBy` is refused after a `Select`** — use `Distinct()`. It emits
  `row_number() over (partition by …)` filtered to 1, because keeping one *whole document* per key is
  not something DISTINCT can express. SQLite has had window functions since 3.25.
- **Ordering after a `Select` is only `OrderBy(x => x)` over a single-value projection**, which is the
  `Select(...).Distinct().OrderBy(x => x)` idiom. Ordering by a member of a *shaped* projection is
  refused rather than unimplemented: the mapping back from an anonymous member to a locator exists
  only while the projection is a plain member-for-member copy, and the whole point of the rewrite is
  that it need not be. Ordering before the `Select` always works.

One `Select` per query; a second would have to project members of the first's result, which is not a
document and has no locators.

**A NULL column becomes the target type's default, not a null.** `json_extract` yields SQL NULL for an
absent key and an aggregate over an empty group yields NULL too, and the compiled projection *unboxes*
each value to its declared type — so a null reaching a non-nullable value type is a
`NullReferenceException` thrown from generated code, with nothing in the message to say which column
or why. Defaulting matches what deserializing the document would have produced for an absent key, and
what the aggregate terminals already return over no rows. Found while building fisher#24, and it
affected both projection paths; pinned by `a_null_column_becomes_the_default_rather_than_throwing` in
both test classes.

**A value `Convert.ChangeType` cannot build goes through the store's serializer** (fisher#361).
`CoerceTo` special-cases enums, timestamps, Guids and strong-typed ids, and used to hand everything else
to `Convert.ChangeType`. `Uri`, `TimeSpan`, `DateOnly` and `TimeOnly` are JSON strings the column returns
as TEXT, and none of them is `IConvertible`. So every `Select` of one threw `InvalidCastException`, while
loading the whole document worked. CritterWatch compiles one source against all three stores and had to
revert a `Select` of a `Uri` to a whole-document read.

- **The serializer, not a parser per type.** A non-`IConvertible` target gets the value re-quoted as a
  JSON token (`JsonEncodedText` does the escaping) and handed to `Options.Serializer.FromJson`. That is
  the same code that built the member on a whole-document load, so its converters, naming policy and enum
  storage all apply, and the two paths cannot disagree. `CoerceTo` and `Coerce<T>` are instance methods
  now for that reason.
- **A string-stored enum was broken the same way, one branch over.** It arrived as its *name* and went
  to `Convert.ToInt64`. The name is also what the serializer wrote under its naming policy (`flashing`,
  not `Flashing`), which is why `Enum.Parse` would be the wrong fix.
- `serializer_shaped_projections` asserts equality with the **whole-document load** rather than with a
  literal, because agreement between those two paths is the property the fix provides.

### LINQ joins

`Join` and `GroupJoin(...).SelectMany(...)` across document tables — `Linq/Joins/`. One join is
fisher#25; a chain of them is fisher#55, and the difference between the two is one type
(`JoinShape`).
**This is the LINQ tier where SQLite is the easiest of the three dialects rather than the hardest**: a
join between two document tables is `join fi_doc_catch inner_t on outer_t.id =
json_extract(inner_t.data, '$.anglerId')`, with no `OPENJSON`, no lateral join, and an expression index
(fisher#16) usable on either side. It is also worth *more* here than on either sibling — the usual
argument against joins in a document store is that a round trip is cheap next to a join's cost, and an
embedded store has no round trip to be cheap; the alternative is two statements and a client-side
stitch.

- **The join is on the ordinary `Statement`, not a parallel one.** Polecat's `JoinStatement`
  re-implements the select list, the wheres, the ordering and the paging, so anything built for one
  shape has to be built again for the other — its join path carries its own `Count` and its own
  `TOP`/`OFFSET` rendering. Fisher's `Count`, `Any`, `ToPagedListAsync` and `ToSql` serve a join
  without knowing it is one. The one place that had to learn about joins is `WrapAsSubquery`, which
  must carry `Joins` and `FromAlias` or a count over a paged join counts the outer table instead.
- **The alias goes into `MemberFactory`, so every locator is built qualified.** Polecat rewrites the
  rendered string afterwards (`AliasingCommandBuilder`, `JoinStatement.AliasLocator`), which produces
  valid SQL that reads the wrong table whenever the pattern matches something it should not. Building
  `json_extract(outer_t.data, …)` from the start cannot — and the alias belongs *inside*
  `json_extract`, on `data`, not on its result. `a_member_both_sides_have_reads_its_own_table` is the
  case that tells the two apart, and removing the qualifier fails 17 of the 27 join tests.
- **Everything about the inner side goes in the `ON` clause; a post-join `where` goes in the `WHERE`.**
  Not an inconsistency — an inner-side filter says which rows the join may *match*, a post-join
  predicate says which joined rows *survive*. On a left join the two differ visibly: the first keeps an
  unmatched outer row and the second may remove it, which is exactly what the same clauses do in
  memory. Putting an inner-side term in the `WHERE` turns a left join back into an inner one, silently
  and only for the rows the left join exists to keep; moving them there fails five tests.
- **The inner query's own predicates are applied. Polecat drops them silently** — it collects only the
  tenant and soft-delete filters for its inner table, so `GroupJoin(session.Query<Catch>().Where(...))`
  there returns rows the caller excluded. Fisher parses the inner source with the same parser and the
  inner alias; anything beyond filtering (ordering, paging, projection) is refused, being a question
  about one outer row's matches after the join has flattened them.
- **All three implicit filters apply per side**, through the same statement-level passes the unjoined
  path uses, now taking a qualifier. That is fisher#51's lesson held to: a fourth caller composing its
  own tenant term is how that bug happened.
- **The inner document is materialized by its own storage's selector, through an offsetting reader.**
  A closed-shape selector reads from fixed positions (id 0, data 1, metadata 2+), so the inner side —
  whose columns start after the outer's — needs the *reader* shifted rather than the selector changed.
  `OffsetDataReader` is that. Polecat's join handler instead calls the serializer on the `data` column
  directly, which loses `doc_type` resolution — a sub-class comes back as its base, quietly missing
  whatever it added — and the metadata binders with it. `a_joined_hierarchy_comes_back_as_its_sub_classes`
  is the dividend.
- **Both spellings collapse to one lambda over the two documents.** A `GroupJoin`'s pair of selectors
  and a query-syntax `Join`'s transparent identifier are the same shape one call apart, so
  `JoinResultSelectorRewriter` serves both; a plain `Join` that spelled its result out needs no rewrite
  at all. **A `GroupJoin`'s second parameter is the group, not a row**, and is deliberately left
  unmapped — an expression still naming it (`x.catches.Count()`) is asking about rows the join has
  flattened, and is refused rather than silently answered about the one matched row.
- **A predicate or ordering key written after the join is resolved against whichever shape it names**,
  decided by its parameter's type rather than by trying one and falling back: method syntax names the
  projected result, query syntax's `where`/`orderby` come before its `select` and name the intermediate
  shape. Both land on the projection's own two parameters, so which side a member belongs to is decided
  **by parameter reference, not by type** — a self-join has the same type on both sides.
- **A member the projection computed is refused rather than sorted or filtered on**, since its value
  exists only after the row is read.
- **The scalar aggregates and `Last` work over a join** (fisher#54), and cost one seam: `JoinPlan.Member`
  holds the post-join member mapping as a closure, so a terminal reaches the same attribution the
  `Where` and the `OrderBy` already used rather than re-deriving it. The two aggregate guards are the
  *resolved member's*, so they apply unchanged. Two SQLite-shaped details:
  - **The aggregate's paged subquery carries `Joins` and `FromAlias`**, exactly as `WrapAsSubquery`
    does — a qualified locator inside a subquery that dropped them is `no such column`, which is the
    one mercy of qualifying: it errors rather than aggregating the outer table alone.
  - **A paged `Last` cannot reuse `ReverseOverPage`.** That one works unjoined because
    `json_extract(data, …)` resolves against the subquery's own `data` column; a join's locator says
    `json_extract(outer_t.data, …)` and the alias does not survive into the enclosing scope. So
    `ReverseJoinOverPage` aliases each ordering key into the page's select list and orders by the
    alias — the trick keyset paging already uses. Trailing columns are safe because both selectors
    read from fixed positions at the front of the row.
- **More than one join per query works** (fisher#55), and what a chain needed was one idea rather than a
  rewrite. `Statement.Joins` was already a list that rendered in order; what a second join could not do
  was resolve its *outer key*, because it is written against the **shape the previous join produced** —
  `x => x.catch.WaterId` names no document until that shape is resolved back to one. `JoinShape` is
  that: per rung, each member of the shape as an expression over the sides' parameters, composed
  forward. Everything that looked like it would need generalising — the offsets, the left-join null
  check, the result selector's arity — turned out to be the same code already written for a list that
  happened to have two entries, so `JoinPlan` holding an outer and an inner became `JoinPlan` holding
  `JoinSide`s.
  - **A shape has to be carried as a whole as well as member by member.** A `GroupJoin`'s own selector
    writes `(y, waters) => new { y, waters }`, where `y` is the *entire* previous rung rather than a
    member of it — so `JoinShape.Body` is mapped directly and member accesses go through the map.
  - **Third and later joins need member folding; the second does not.** A second join's shape holds
    documents, so `x.c.WaterId` resolves to a plain `inner_t.WaterId`. A third join's shape holds the
    *second's shape*, so `z.y.a.Name` would otherwise resolve to `new { a = t0, c = t1 }.a.Name` — a
    legal expression tree that evaluates correctly in memory and is not a member chain rooted at a
    parameter, which is the only thing the member factories and the where parser translate.
  - **The group stays unmapped, and that is what refuses a question about it.** Dropping a
    `GroupJoin`'s group from the shape's members leaves an expression naming it still rooted at the
    shape's own parameter after the rewrite, which is exactly the condition reported as untranslatable.
    Mapping it would silently turn `x.catches.Count()` into a count of the one matched row.
  - **`outer_t` and `inner_t` are kept rather than renumbered to `t0`/`t1`**, with a chain numbering
    from `inner_t2` on. `ToSql` exists to be read, one join is overwhelmingly the common case, and the
    two names say which side is which where a number does not.
- Refused by name, each with the alternative: keyset paging, JSON reads, and
  `Select`/`GroupBy`/`Distinct`/`DistinctBy` after the join. `ToListAsync`, the `First`/`Single`/`Last`
  families, the scalar aggregates, `CountAsync`, `AnyAsync`, `ToPagedListAsync` and `ToSql` all work,
  over a chain as well as over one join.

### Vector search — fisher#241

`VectorSearchAsync` / `VectorSearchWithScoresAsync` on `IQuerySession`, over a member declared with
`Schema.For<T>().VectorIndex(x => x.Embedding, dimensions, distance)` or `[VectorIndex(dimensions)]`.
The API shape is Marten.PgVector's and the types are the store-neutral ones from
`JasperFx.Events.Vectors` (`IEmbeddingProvider`, `DistanceFunction`, `VectorMatch<T>`), so
application code reads the same against either store.

- **The search reads the embedding straight out of `data`, and that is the whole design.** One
  statement built by `FisherQueryProvider.VectorSearchAsync`: the document's columns plus
  `fi_vector_distance(metric, json_extract(data, '$.embedding'), @query)`, ordered by that distance,
  limited; the query vector bound as a float32 BLOB. `StoreOptions.Functions` is the new
  `SqliteFunctionRegistry` the data source registers on every connection (weasel#588), and the
  distance function is registered in the `StoreOptions` constructor so it is on every tenant's
  connections for free.
- ⚠️ **It is an ordinary `Statement` over `Query<T>()`, not hand-built SQL, and fisher#285 is why.**
  The first version composed its own string and restated ONE implicit filter — the soft-delete one.
  So it ignored the two it did not restate: conjoined tenancy, where a session opened for tenant `a`
  ranked and returned tenant `b`'s rows, and the `doc_type` discriminator, where a search over a
  sub-class read its siblings. Silent, and asymmetric in the fisher#51 direction — the tenant owning
  most of the corpus sees a correct-looking answer with extras. Going through `BuildStatement` means
  the filters are `Query<T>()`'s, from the same code, so the next one added to LINQ cannot be missed
  here again. `Statement.SelectFragment` exists for this one caller: the select list carries
  `fi_vector_distance(?, locator, ?)`'s two parameters, and `SelectColumns` is a plain string with
  nowhere to put one.
- **The `filter` predicate is free once it is a statement** (jasperfx#843): the caller's expression is
  appended as an ordinary `Where` on that queryable, so it supports and refuses exactly what
  `Query<T>().Where(...)` does. Applied BEFORE the limit, and Fisher scans every row — so the result
  is the true top-k of the filtered set with **no recall caveat**, which a store on an approximate
  index cannot say (pgvector's `hnsw.ef_search` bounds what the filter sees).
- **Two knock-on differences from the old raw-SQL path, both towards `Query<T>()` rather than away.**
  The rows materialize through the session's own storage, so a tracking session tracks them; and the
  statement runs outside `StoreOptions.ResiliencePipeline`, which no LINQ query has ever run inside —
  where `IAdvancedSql.QueryAsync` did. Both are parity with every other query rather than a loss.
- ⚠️ **No side table and no trigger, deliberately, and not for lack of trying.** SQLite has no
  built-in that turns a JSON array into a float32 BLOB, so a trigger keeping a BLOB column in step —
  the full-text index's shape — would have to call an application-defined function, and then every
  foreign writer on the file (an EF Core context, the `sqlite3` shell, a restore) fails with *no such
  function*. A side table maintained on Fisher's own write path would go silently stale under those
  same writers, which is exactly the failure the full-text design refused. Reading from `data` cannot
  drift; `a_write_that_bypassed_fisher_still_ranks_by_the_new_vector` pins it.
- **Brute force, and honest about it.** The JSON is parsed on every row (`Utf8JsonReader`, pooled
  buffer); a 768-float embedding parses in tens of microseconds, so a search is milliseconds at
  thousands of rows and under a second at tens of thousands — Fisher's scale. `sqlite-vec` is
  deliberately not taken on: pre-1.0, no NuGet package, a native binary per platform behind a feature
  that works without one. `VectorSearchAsync` is the seam it would slot behind.
- **Every metric is a distance — smaller is closer — including inner product, which is negated**, so
  one `ORDER BY` serves all three and the promise `DistanceFunction` makes on every store holds here.
- **`VectorIndex` is metadata, not a schema object**, and what it buys is the refusals: a search on a
  type with no declared index, on a member that is not the declared one, or with a query vector of
  another length is refused by name before any SQL runs — the full-text rule, because the alternative
  is valid SQL that scans nothing. A *stored* vector of the wrong length fails its row loudly inside
  the function, the one check that cannot happen earlier because the JSON is the record.
- **The locator comes from `MemberFactory`**, so the serializer's naming policy and
  `[JsonPropertyName]` decide the path — the Marten.PgVector bug (`member.Name` regardless of casing,
  zero rows with no error) is not repeated.
- **All three implicit filters apply** — conjoined tenancy, the `doc_type` discriminator and soft
  deletes — because they are `Query<T>()`'s own, not a restatement (fisher#285). The old claim here,
  that "tenancy needs nothing, a tenant being its own database", was true of database-per-tenant and
  false of conjoined, which is exactly how the bug survived being written down.
- **`IDocumentSearchOperations` is implemented, reached through `IDocumentReadOperations.Search`**
  (jasperfx#842). `FisherDocumentSearchOperations` forwards to the extension methods rather than
  building a second statement — a second path is a second place for those filters to be forgotten,
  and a consumer reaching search through the store-agnostic surface is the one least able to notice.
  ⚠️ **Behind an accessor, not on the session**: Fisher's entry points are extension methods already
  NAMED `VectorSearchWithScoresAsync` / `HybridSearchWithScoresAsync`, so instance members of those
  names would win overload resolution over them at every existing call site, silently. The explicit
  implementation on `FisherSession` is the non-covariance trap the two `Events` ones record, one
  member over — the contract's default throws, and only a caller holding the session as the contract
  would ever notice its absence.

### Hybrid search — fisher#262

`HybridSearchAsync` / `HybridSearchWithScoresAsync`, fusing the full-text and vector legs by
**reciprocal rank fusion** — `score(d) = Σ 1 / (k + rank(d))`, `k` 60 by convention and settable.

- **RRF rather than a weighted score sum, and that is the load-bearing choice.** bm25 and cosine
  distance are not on a comparable scale, so normalising them means picking constants that are wrong
  for someone's corpus. RRF reads only the *ordinal position* in each leg, so the two need no
  calibration against each other and the fusion behaves the same whatever the embedding model or the
  tokenizer is.
- **Two statements fused in memory, not one.** Each leg already runs through tested machinery — the
  text leg is an ordinary `Query<T>()` with the full-text predicate and `OrderByRelevance()`, the
  vector leg is `VectorSearchAsync` — so the fuse inherits the tenant, soft-delete and hierarchy
  filters and the existing refusals **without restating any of them**. One statement would be a join
  whose plan neither index serves, and a fifth place for those filters to be forgotten, which is how
  fisher#51 happened.
- **The fusion is over the union**, so a document one leg alone found still scores. That is the point
  rather than a tolerance: what the keyword leg alone finds is exactly what the vector leg is bad at.
- **`CandidateDepth` must exceed `limit`** and defaults to `max(limit × 4, 50)`. A document ranked
  40th by one leg and 1st by the other is the result the feature exists for, and reading only `limit`
  per leg would never see it; below `limit` is refused rather than answered with a short list.
- ⚠️ **A type with only one of the two indexes is refused, not degraded** — the user's ruling, and the
  same stance `VectorSearchAsync` takes on an undeclared index. Degrading would silently change what
  the method means, and a caller who asked for hybrid search and got half has no way to find out. The
  check is up front rather than left to whichever leg runs first, so the message is about *hybrid*
  search rather than about one leg.
- **Ties are broken deterministically** — score, then best rank, then identity. Two documents at the
  same rank in one leg and absent from the other have identical scores, which is common rather than
  exotic, and without a total order the page a caller gets differs between runs. Same lesson keyset
  paging records.
- **The types and the fusion are shared now** (jasperfx#840/#844). `HybridSearchOptions`,
  `HybridTextStyle` and `HybridMatch<T>` come from `JasperFx.Events.Vectors`; the private `Fuse` is
  `ReciprocalRankFusion.Fuse`, and the option refusals are `HybridSearchOptions.ResolveCandidateDepth`.
  The record's positional parameters are Fisher's exact order with `RegConfig` appended and the enum
  members are Fisher's names, so **no construction site moved** — a file naming `HybridSearchOptions`
  without a `using JasperFx.Events.Vectors;` is the whole of the break. `RegConfig` is Postgres's and
  Fisher ignores it. The shared fusion also fuses **by key across document types**, which the local
  copy could not: a snapshot document carrying the FTS5 index fused with a separate embedding document
  is the shape a vector projection writes.
- **The vector leg carries the tenant and hierarchy filters now too** (fisher#285). The claim above
  that the fuse "inherits the tenant, soft-delete and hierarchy filters" was true of the TEXT leg
  only; the vector leg restated soft delete alone, so another tenant's document arrived through the
  fusion ranked lower rather than first.
- **The `filter` reaches both legs**, before each leg's candidate depth (jasperfx#843) — otherwise
  rows the caller will discard consume the depth and the fused order ranks a set that includes them.
- **`HybridTextStyle` offers `PlainText` (default) and `WebStyle` only.** Raw `Search` syntax is
  deliberately absent: it can be malformed, and a malformed query in one leg fails the whole fused
  call, where in a plain `Where(x => x.Search(...))` it fails only the thing the caller asked for.
- **The discriminating test is `agreement_between_the_legs_outranks_a_single_leg_winner`**, because
  almost every other assertion about a hybrid search is satisfied by either leg alone. Its corpus is
  built so the legs *disagree*: an exact identifier no embedding places, a paraphrase sharing no
  tokens, and a middling-in-both document the fusion must lift above them. Verified by dropping the
  vector leg from the fuse — three tests fail.

### The vector projection — fisher#261

`Projections/Vectors/` — `VectorProjection<TDoc, TId>`, the half of vector search that *produces* an
embedding from a stream where `VectorSearchAsync` (fisher#241) searches one the application already
put on the document. `Configure(map)` declares `map.Map<TEvent>(content, id)` and
`map.Delete<TEvent>(id)`; content is SHA-256 hashed, and an unchanged hash costs no provider call.

**The body of it is `VectorProjectionMap<TId>` + `VectorEmbeddingPlan<TId>`, shared since
jasperfx#841**, and Fisher's shapes were the reference for both — so nothing about a declaration
moved except the map's type parameters (`VectorProjectionMap<TDoc, TId>` → `VectorProjectionMap<TId>`;
the document type was never used by the map). What is left here is the two things only a store can do:
read the current hashes, and write the rows.

- ⚠️ **The hash spelling was MEASURED before the swap, not assumed.** Both are
  `Convert.ToHexStringLower(SHA256.HashData(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(content)))`, byte for byte. The
  hash is *persisted* beside the vector, so a different spelling — upper-case hex, base64, a different
  encoding — would miss on every stored row exactly once and re-embed a customer's whole corpus at
  their provider's meter, silently. `the_shared_hash_is_fishers_own_spelling` and
  `a_hash_written_before_the_swap_still_skips_the_model` pin both halves.
- **`MapFromAggregate` is the new capability**, and partial-update events are why: given
  `MemoRevised { Title = null, Body = "new" }` where null means unchanged, a one-event selector has no
  right answer — the new body alone re-embeds without the title, and null leaves the embedding stale.
  Fisher builds the text by **live aggregation up to the version of the last triggering event in the
  page**, not to the head of the stream: a rebuild must embed the state the page describes, or it
  produces different embeddings than the original run did. ⚠️ Reading an ASYNC snapshot would be the
  wrong answer — the daemon does not order shards against each other, so one shard can read a snapshot
  another has not caught up to. The aggregate type is closed over reflectively (`FoldAndApplyAsync<T>`,
  with the two AOT suppressions the `CompactStreamAsync` reflection carries), so only "which aggregate
  type" is reflective and the awaiting is ordinary typed code.
- **One small semantic moved with the shared plan**: content that is whitespace is now dropped along
  with null, and a delete followed in the same page by an event whose selector returns null leaves the
  document written-nothing rather than deleted. Both are the shared rules.

Ported in shape from `Marten.PgVector.Projection.VectorProjection`. **Four things differ, and all four
are defects in that template rather than dialect differences** — which is why each is a test here
rather than a comment:

- ⚠️ **It queues onto the session rather than opening a connection.** Marten's runs its reads and
  writes on `database.CreateConnection()`, outside the session's transaction, so **an embedding
  commits even when the events that caused it roll back**. Fisher's `IProjection` is handed the
  session, so the embedding row and the progression row land in one transaction — and on SQLite a
  second connection writing while the batch holds the file's write lock would block against itself
  anyway.
- ⚠️ **Not Guid-only.** Marten's hardcodes `Guid` at the column, the extraction tuple and the hash
  dictionary, so a string-identified store cannot use it at all. `TId` is open here, so all four id
  types and strong-typed wrappers work; `the_document_identity_is_not_restricted_to_guid` states it,
  and the whole test class being string-keyed is the evidence.
- ⚠️ **A delete addresses the row the map wrote.** Marten's delete path reads `@event.StreamId`
  unconditionally and ignores the configured id selector, so a projection keyed on a payload member
  deletes nothing and the row stays in the index forever. **The fix is that there is no
  `Delete<TEvent>()` overload without a selector** — making the two structurally incapable of
  disagreeing beats checking that they agree, and the common case costs `e => e.StreamId`.
- ⚠️ **A selector that throws is not swallowed.** Marten's catches everything and returns null, which
  the caller reads as "this event carries no content" — so a bug in a selector drops the document from
  the index with nothing reported. Here it propagates and faults the shard, which is what the daemon's
  error handling is for. **Returning null is still "no content"**, which is a real and distinct answer.

Three things that are Fisher's own:

- **It writes an ordinary document, not a table of its own**, which is what makes the result
  searchable with nothing added: the document declares `VectorIndex(x => x.Embedding, dimensions)` and
  `VectorSearchAsync` and `HybridSearchAsync` read it like any other. The migration, soft delete,
  tenancy and identity map all apply without this class knowing about them.
- **Asynchronous only, and refused otherwise since fisher#287.** Embedding is a network call per
  batch, and an inline projection runs inside the caller's `SaveChangesAsync` — holding SQLite's
  single write lock open across an HTTP round trip to an embedding API would block every other writer
  in the process for its duration. Marten refuses inline too, for the weaker reason that it needs its
  own connection. It was documented and unenforced for two releases: `VectorProjection` is a bare
  `IProjection`, so `Projections.Add(projection, Inline)` binds to `ProjectionGraph.Add`, which
  refuses only `Live`.
  - **An ordinary `IValidatedProjection<StoreOptions>`, which is only possible because jasperfx#845
    shipped.** `ProjectionGraph.AssertValidity` used to test the sources with
    `OfType<IValidatedProjection<T>>()`, and a `ProjectionWrapper` is not its inner projection's type
    — so the interface was never asked and the check would have failed OPEN. Polecat's port ran a pass
    of its own (`AssertVectorProjectionsAreAsync`) for exactly that reason; Fisher does not need one.
  - ⚠️ **The same fix means a hand-written `IProjection` in a Fisher application that implemented
    `IValidatedProjection<StoreOptions>` starts being asked on the 2.70.0 bump**, which can surface
    configuration errors that were silently passing.
  - **The lifecycle is read off the registration, not off the projection**, because a bare
    `IProjection` has nowhere to carry one — the wrapper the graph built is what knows. So the refusal
    cannot be reached around by the static type of the variable that held the projection.
- **The declared index is checked against the provider on the first page**, both that it is on
  `Embedding` and that its dimensions match. Both fail silently otherwise, and the second is the worse
  one: the rows are written and every *search* then refuses at the caller's end with a message about
  the query vector, pointing away from the projection that produced them. Checked on first use rather
  than at construction because the projection is built before the store is.

⚠️ **The existing-hash read uses `IsOneOf`, not `ids.Contains(x.Id)`.** An array receiver binds to
`MemoryExtensions.Contains(ReadOnlySpan<T>, T)`, and the span operand cannot be unwrapped when `T` is
an open type parameter — a ref struct cannot be returned as `object`. `IsOneOf` is fisher#26's marker
operator and reads the same.

**`unchanged_content_is_not_embedded_again` counts provider calls rather than inspecting rows**, and
that is the only way to state it: the stored document is identical whether it was skipped or
re-embedded, so nothing but the call count distinguishes them. Verified by removing the skip — one
test fails.

### The four Marten operators — fisher#202

`MatchesSql`, `Stats(out QueryStatistics)`, `ToAsyncEnumerable()` and `ExplainAsync`. Small, and three
of the four are decisions rather than mechanics.

- ⚠️ **`MatchesSql` is the one fragment whose SQL text comes from the caller.** Every other fragment
  in `Linq/SqlGeneration` is composed by the parser out of locators it resolved, which is what the
  fisher#161/#162 audit rests on — `LiteralSqlFragment`'s own doc comment says it is never built from
  a caller-supplied value. That invariant is moved rather than weakened: the *text* is the caller's by
  contract, every *value* is bound, and values go through `SqliteParameterValue.ToDatabaseValue` for
  the reason raw SQL does — a Guid, a timestamp and a decimal each bind to something Fisher never
  wrote and match **nothing**, silently.
  - **The fragment is parenthesized, where Marten's is not.** A statement's `Wheres` are composed with
    `and`, so an unbracketed `a or b` swallows every term beside it — including the implicit tenant,
    soft-delete and hierarchy filters. That is the one way this operator could become fisher#51 again.
  - **A placeholder/value count mismatch is refused by name**, which marten#5289's follow-up had to
    add after the fact: too few is an `IndexOutOfRangeException` from inside the provider, too many is
    silence with the surplus never reaching the query.
  - Registered in `MethodCallParserRegistry` rather than through `WhereClauseParser`'s unused
    `additionalParsers` seam, so it reaches the event-side predicates too. A method that compiles
    everywhere and refuses itself in half the places is the worse surface, and the trust model is
    identical wherever it lands.
- **`Stats` rides on the expression tree.** Marten mutates its queryable and its own source carries a
  `TODO -- make this be an expression here!` beside the slot; `FisherQueryable<T>` holds no per-query
  state and `System.Linq`'s operators return fresh instances, so a slot would be dropped by the next
  `Where`. Captured in `ExecuteReaderAsync` rather than at each of the seven row-returning terminals —
  the argument the query span and fisher#74's table provisioning both make. **A scalar terminal
  refuses it by name**: it already *is* the number, and a `TotalResults` left at zero is a wrong
  answer the caller cannot see. `CountIgnoringPagingAsync` clears the request, or the count that
  computes the total would refuse itself.
- **`ToAsyncEnumerable` is cheaper here than the raw-SQL twin.** `IAdvancedSql.StreamAsync` sits
  outside `StoreOptions.ResiliencePipeline` because a retried `SQLITE_BUSY` re-executes the whole
  delegate; the LINQ path never ran inside it, so this forfeits nothing `ToListAsync` has. Validation
  runs *before* the iterator, since an `async` iterator defers its body to the first `MoveNextAsync`
  and a refusal written inline would surface at the `await foreach` rather than at the call. A join is
  refused (its rows are stitched by the join plan); a `Select` projection streams.
- **`ExplainAsync` is taken over the exact statement the query would run**, prefix and all, because
  SQLite reaches an expression index only when the query's expression matches the index's — a plan
  over a re-derivation reports the wrong answer with a straight face. `QueryPlan` is deliberately
  nothing like Marten's: PostgreSQL returns a costed JSON tree with an optional execution pass, SQLite
  four columns of prose with no costs and no `ANALYZE`, so `Steps` is what SQLite said and `UsesIndex`
  is an honest reading of that prose rather than a structured field.

### The mapping registry gaps — fisher#218

`MartenRegistry` members `DocumentMappingExpression<T>` lacked. What was implemented, and what was not.

- **`Identity(x => x.Member)`** — and it forced a real change. `DocumentMapping`'s constructor used to
  *throw* for a type with no usable identity member, which made the rescue unreachable for exactly the
  types it exists for: the refusal fired before the line that fixes it could run. Identity is now
  resolved without being demanded, and `DocumentStore`'s constructor asserts it through
  `DocumentSchema.AssertEveryMappingHasIdentity`. **The property that mattered is unchanged** — a
  document type Fisher cannot store is still a configuration-time error naming the type, never an
  `InvalidOperationException` on somebody's first save. Three tests moved from
  `Should.Throw(() => options.Schema.For<T>())` to `Should.Throw(() => DocumentStore.For(...))`.
- **`IdStrategy(IIdentification<T, TId>)`** — Marten's takes an `IIdGeneration`, a code-generation
  contract with no counterpart here; Fisher's strategies are ordinary objects from the shared Weasel
  identity runtime, so the seam is that interface and a caller implements two members.
  ⚠️ **A Guid strategy is wrapped in `SqliteGuidIdentification`, never taken raw.** The
  lowercase-canonical conversion lives in the identity strategy precisely so a wrapper cannot lose it —
  so a *replaced* strategy is exactly where it could be lost, and losing it writes rows that can never
  be read back. `SqliteGuidIdentification`'s constructor was widened from the concrete
  `SequentialGuidIdentification<TDoc>` to the interface for this.
- **Partial indexes**, as `Index(member, predicate: x => …)`. The predicate is an ordinary expression
  through the same `WhereClauseParser` and `MemberFactory` a query goes through — not a SQL string,
  and that is the point: SQLite reaches a partial index only when the query's `WHERE` implies the
  index's, over the terms as written, so a hand-spelled predicate is fisher#16's failure again.
  ⚠️ **`LiteralRenderingCommandBuilder` is the exception to "values are always bound", and it exists
  because DDL has nowhere to bind them.** What makes it safe is the reach rather than the escaping:
  the values are constants in a configuration lambda at startup, the same trust class as a
  `[JsonPropertyName]`. It escapes anyway, and **refuses by name** anything it cannot render
  unambiguously rather than reaching for `ToString()` — the marten#4954 class one type over.
- **`IndexLastModified` / `IndexCreatedAt` / `IndexTenantId` / `SoftDeletedWithIndex`** — plain column
  indexes, since those are real columns. `IndexCreatedAt` *enables* the opt-in column too: an index
  over a column that does not exist is not a weaker version of the feature, it fails the migration.
  `IndexTenantId` is refused for a single-tenant type, and is worth less here than on either sibling —
  `tenant_id` already leads the conjoined primary key.
- **`IgnoreIndex`** — `Weasel.Core.TableBase` already had it, and `Table.FetchExisting` drops an
  ignored name from the table it reads back, so the delta never sees it in either direction. Applied
  *after* the declared indexes deliberately: Weasel refuses to ignore a name the table declares, and
  that refusal is right — a collision, not an exemption.
- **`[DocumentAlias]`, `[MultiTenanted]`, `[UseOptimisticConcurrency]`, `[ForeignKey]`** — read in
  `ApplySchemaAttributes`, layer three of four. `[ForeignKey]` is applied after `[DuplicateField]` on
  the same member so an explicit duplicate names the column and the type; `Duplicate` is idempotent, so
  the key's implicit one finds it.
- **`HiloSettings(settings)`** — the method form of the settable property, so a configuration block
  reads the same as Marten's.

**Skipped, and why** (recorded in the migration guide's "will not be" table rather than implemented as
no-ops): the whole partitioning family, row-level security and GIN indexes — none exist in SQLite;
`UniqueIndexType`, `TenancyScope`, `IsConcurrent`, index sort order and casing — every one describes a
*computed column* and a PostgreSQL index, where a Fisher index is an expression index and a duplicated
field is a `VIRTUAL` generated column that cannot drift, so `Computed` vs `DuplicatedField` has nothing
to choose between; `PropertySearching`, `DdlTemplate`, `StructuralTyped` and per-type
`DatabaseSchemaName` — not SQLite concepts, and the schema folds into the table prefix; `UseIdentityKey`
— a database-assigned identity needs the write path to read the id back rather than assign it
client-side, which is a different write path rather than a strategy.

### LINQ paging

Two operators answering different questions, both carried for the reason Polecat and Marten carry both
(fisher#27). `ToPagedListAsync` can jump to an arbitrary page and reports a total; `ToCursorPageAsync`
can do neither, but is stable under concurrent writes and does not degrade as the offset grows.

- **The page's total is a second statement, not `count(*) over ()`.** A window function returns *no
  row at all* when the page is past the end — which is exactly when a pager most needs the real total.
  Same reasoning as `a_page_past_the_end_still_reports_the_total` in the event-store explorer's paging,
  and pinned the same way here.
- **`CountIgnoringPagingAsync` is deliberately distinct from `CountAsync`.** The latter counts the
  *page* when the query is paged (`Take(5).CountAsync()` is 5); the former discards `Take`/`Skip`
  because a total that counted the page would say nothing. Both are right for their caller; conflating
  them would make one silently wrong.
- **Keyset pagination requires a terminal identity key**, and this is the guard that makes the rest
  honest. Without a total order, rows tied on the sort key have no defined order between them and a
  seek boundary lands mid-tie — skipping some and repeating others, silently, and only when there are
  ties. Verified by removing the check and walking a fully-tied key: the walk loses rows.
- **The seek is the expanded OR-of-ANDs, not SQLite's row-value comparison.** Row values (available
  since 3.15) would be one comparison the planner could serve from a composite index, but they only
  express a seek when every key runs the same direction — and mixed direction is the common case
  (`OrderByDescending(x => x.Landed).ThenBy(x => x.Id)`). Special-casing uniform orderings is an
  optimisation, not a correctness matter.
- **Cursor values are typed on decode by the query's ordering members, never by the cursor.** The
  payload carries no type information, so a hand-edited cursor can change values but not what they are
  read as. Every value then binds as a parameter. The `v1:` base64-JSON format is byte-identical to
  Polecat's so a cursor is portable between the stores.
- **`CursorPage<T>` is typed where Polecat's `CursorPageResult` is pre-rendered JSON.** Polecat's shape
  exists to feed a `StreamPagedByCursor` HTTP result in its ASP.NET Core package; Fisher has neither
  that package (fisher#49) nor JSON-returning reads (fisher#28), so a JSON result would be a shape with
  no consumer. The JSON variant belongs with fisher#49, built on this.
- Ordering keys are read **off the row**, not off the materialized document — a key can be any locator,
  including one no member of the result exposes. They are appended to the select list *after* the
  document's own columns, which is safe because the storage selector resolves from fixed positions
  starting at 0.

### LINQ grouping

`GroupBy`, a `Select` over the group, and `HAVING` (fisher#24). `GroupProjection` uses the same
compiled rewrite as `SelectProjection`; what differs is what counts as a column — over a group there is
no document parameter, only `g.Key` and aggregates over the group. `GroupingTranslator` turns those
into SQL and is shared with the HAVING parser, so the two cannot disagree about what `g.Count()` means.
`RowProjection` is the common shape both projections reduce to, so the provider has one projected read
path rather than two that would drift.

**The trap this feature was expected to have does not exist.** SQLite permits a bare non-aggregated
column in a `GROUP BY` select and picks an arbitrary row for it, where T-SQL rejects the query — so a
query that errors on Polecat would silently return arbitrary data here, and the plan was to validate
it in the parser. It is unreachable through this API: the `Select`'s parameter is the *grouping*, so
there is no ungrouped member in scope to select. The type system does the validation for free, and
that is worth knowing before someone adds a validator for a case that cannot arise.

- **Where a `Where` sits decides what it filters.** Before the `GroupBy` it is a `WHERE` over rows;
  after it, a `HAVING` over groups. The chain is walked source-outward, so which one it is falls out of
  whether the key has been seen yet — no lookahead.
- **The HAVING parser is deliberately narrower than `WhereClauseParser`**: a comparison between a
  grouping expression and a constant, composed with `&&`/`||`/`!`, with reversed operands flipped
  (`1 < g.Count()` is `count(*) > 1`). Widening it would mean answering questions about individual
  rows from a clause that runs after they have been collapsed.
- **Aggregates over a group reuse fisher#22's two guards**, for the same reasons — `sum()` over text
  returns 0 rather than failing, and a string-stored enum does not order.
- **Ordering a grouped query is by the key or an aggregate**, which is the reason grouping is usually
  reached for (`OrderByDescending(g => g.Count())`). It must come *before* the `Select` in the chain,
  because after it the element is the projected type; after a single-value grouped `Select`,
  `OrderBy(x => x)` works the same way it does for an ordinary projection.
- **`GroupBy` without a `Select` is refused**, rather than handing back `IGrouping` instances — that
  would mean reading every row of every group, which is the opposite of what grouping in SQL is for.
  The element- and result-selector overloads are refused for the same reason.

### LINQ aggregates and `Last`

`SumAsync` / `MinAsync` / `MaxAsync` / `AverageAsync`, `LastAsync` / `LastOrDefaultAsync`, and the
predicate overloads of the existing terminals (fisher#22).

**They never enter the expression tree.** Polecat builds a synthetic `MethodCallExpression` carrying
the selector and parses it back out; Fisher's terminal extensions take the selector as an argument, so
`LinqQueryParser` needed no change at all and stays what its doc comment says it is — a description of
the operator *chain*. The predicate overloads are `queryable.Where(predicate).XAsync()`, so they
compose rather than duplicating anything.

**The aggregate builds from the chain's source type, not from its element type** (fisher#54). Both a
join and a `Select` make the queryable's element type diverge from the document's, and asking the
schema for a mapping of *that* is an `InvalidOperationException` about identity members — a message
naming neither the operator nor the reason. Since `SourceTypeFor` already answers the question for
every other terminal, the aggregates now use it too: a join is answered, and a projection is refused as
a `BadLinqExpressionException` naming the operator. `an_aggregate_after_a_select_is_refused_by_name`
pins the second half, which was a real defect rather than a missing feature.

Four things are decisions rather than mechanics:

- **The empty result is the case that matters.** `sum`, `min`, `max` and `avg` all return NULL over no
  rows where `count` returns 0, so `Coerce` maps null to `default` before casting. An unguarded cast
  fails *only* on an empty result, which is how it would ship. `total()` would give 0.0 for an empty
  `sum` but is always REAL, so it is the wrong tool for the int and decimal overloads.
- **`Coerce` needs three explicit conversions, and they are exactly the types Fisher encodes rather
  than stores natively** — so `Convert.ChangeType` is broken precisely where this store differs from
  its siblings and nowhere else. An enum comes back INTEGER and needs `Enum.ToObject`; a timestamp
  comes back as `TimestampMember`'s `strftime` text, which has **no `Z` suffix**, so it goes through
  `SqliteTimestamp.FromDatabaseValue` whose `AssumeUniversal` is what makes that correct rather than
  local; a Guid comes back TEXT. Neither `DateTimeOffset` nor `Guid` is `IConvertible` at all — both
  throw `InvalidCastException` from inside `Convert.ChangeType`. All three were found by tests failing,
  not by inspection.
- **Two guards, which is why `AggregateFunction` is an enum and not a SQL string.** `Min`/`Max` need
  only that the member orders — a string minimum and a timestamp minimum are real answers — so they
  reuse `AllowsRangeComparison`, the same check `OrderBy` applies. `Sum`/`Average` need an actual
  number, because **SQLite's `sum()` over text returns 0 rather than failing**: summing a string-stored
  enum would report a plausible total for a column that has none. Enums are excluded from `Sum` even
  under `AsInteger`, since their numeric value is an identifier.
- **Paging wraps, for both.** `Take(5).SumAsync(...)` sums the page, so the paged query becomes a
  subquery projecting the member under an alias and the aggregate wraps it — the same trap
  `CountAsync` already documents. `Last` needs the *inverse*: `OrderBy(x).Take(3).LastAsync()` is the
  last of those three, so the reversal goes on the **outer** statement, not in place. Inverting in
  place answers about the whole table. Both verified by reverting them.

One consequence worth stating because it looks like a bug: **`MinAsync(x => x.Id)` over a Guid orders
by text, which is not .NET's `Guid` ordering.** `Guid.CompareTo` compares the first group as a *signed*
int, so the two disagree whenever the set straddles `0x80000000`. A test comparing against
`Enumerable.Min` would be a genuine intermittent; `min_and_max_over_members_that_are_not_numbers`
builds its expectation with `StringComparer.Ordinal` instead.

### Sessions, `SessionOptions` and enlistment

`DocumentStore.QuerySession()`, `OpenSession(SessionOptions)`, and `Internal/Sessions/` (fisher#30).
The store used to expose exactly one factory, `LightweightSession(tenantId)`, against Polecat's eight.

**Enlistment is the part that matters, and it is worth more here than the same feature is on either
sibling.** One writer per file, and an application using Fisher keeps its own tables in that file — so
without a way to hand Fisher an open transaction, "my rows and Fisher's, or neither" means taking the
write lock twice and contending with yourself. `QueueSqlCommand` (fisher#34) answers the same problem
from the other direction.

**Three modes, one rule each.** No `Connection` and no `Transaction` is the ordinary session; a
`Connection` alone means Fisher opens and commits its own transaction on it and **never disposes a
connection it did not open**; a `Transaction` means Fisher **neither commits nor rolls back**. Marten's
`OwnsConnectionLifecycle` / `OwnsTransactionLifecycle` pair is deliberately absent — four combinations
of which two are traps, in place of two rules that are always true.

`IConnectionLifetime` is much narrower than Polecat's interface of the same name, which wraps every
execution. Fisher's session hands its connection out rather than executing through a lifetime object
(the append planner, the tag writer and the boundary check all take a connection *and* a transaction),
so it carries only the two things that actually vary: where the connection comes from, and the
caller's transaction to join.

Five decisions in the enlisted path, each of which would be silently wrong the other way:

- **`command.Transaction` is set on every command, and without it enlistment does not work at all.**
  Microsoft.Data.Sqlite refuses to execute a command whose `Transaction` is unset while its connection
  has a pending local transaction — *"Execute requires the command to have a transaction object"*. A
  command from `connection.CreateCommand()` inherits the connection's transaction and never meets
  this; **Weasel's command builder compiles a detached command**, which is what every Fisher statement
  is. `FisherSession.ConfigureCommandAsync` is the one place that sets it, and routing the four
  command sites through it is what keeps that true. Verified by removing the line: six of
  `session_options`' tests fail with that exact message. **The pre-projection version read was the
  exception** (fisher#300): `AppendPlanner.AssignVersionsAheadOfProjectionsAsync` takes its
  transaction as a parameter rather than going through `ConfigureCommandAsync`, and was handed
  `null` — right for an owned session, which has not opened its transaction yet, and fatal for an
  enlisted one, whose connection already has the caller's pending. Every enlisted test passed because
  none of their stores registered a projection. It now joins `EnlistedTransaction`; pinned by
  `an_enlisted_session_still_appends_when_an_inline_projection_is_registered`, whose store has one.
- **No resilience pipeline.** An ordinary commit can be retried after `SQLITE_BUSY` because the failed
  attempt's transaction rolled back with it. An enlisted one did not — it is the caller's and still
  open — so a retry would write everything the first attempt already wrote a second time. The busy
  surfaces to the caller instead. Same property as `StreamAsync` and `AfterCommitAsync`.
- **No post-commit step.** An outbox's `AfterCommitAsync` and the append observer both claim "everyone
  can see this now", and Fisher is not told when the caller commits. Neither fires; `BeforeCommitAsync`
  does, as the last thing the session writes.
- **Document tables are not created on demand.** That path runs a migration on its own connection,
  which would block against the write lock the caller's transaction is holding — a session deadlocking
  against itself, presenting after thirty seconds as `database is locked`. A missing table throws by
  name instead. The existence check runs on the *caller's* connection, so a table created inside the
  same transaction counts, which is what makes "your tables and Fisher's in one transaction" work.
  **The projection-storage seam bypassed this** (fisher#300):
  `IStorageOperations.FetchProjectionStorageAsync`, which the inline projection engine calls from
  `SaveChangesAsync`, went straight to `EnsureDocumentTableAsync` — the deadlock above, verbatim, for
  any enlisted save on a store with an inline projection registered. It takes the same branch now.
- **A deferred caller transaction weakens the append guard, and Fisher cannot warn about it.** The
  append planner reads a stream's version and writes version+1 on the strength of holding the write
  lock. SQLite still refuses the second writer, so there is no lost update; what changes is that the
  loser gets `SQLITE_BUSY` at first write rather than a clean concurrency failure. The provider reports
  `Serializable` for a deferred transaction and an immediate one alike, so the two are
  indistinguishable from outside — documentation is the only instrument available.

**`SessionOptions.IsolationLevel` is carried for parity and refuses exactly one value.** Verified
against Microsoft.Data.Sqlite 10.0.9: `Unspecified`, `ReadCommitted`, `RepeatableRead` and
`Serializable` all produce the same `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` and all report `Serializable` back; `Chaos` and
`Snapshot` are refused by the provider. **`ReadUncommitted` is refused by Fisher** — it is the one
value that begins a *deferred* transaction, and nothing would signal the loss, because the transaction
still describes itself as `Serializable`. So Polecat code setting `ReadCommitted` (its default) ports
across and behaves identically.

**`SessionOptions.Timeout` means something different here than on either sibling, in two ways.** It
bounds how long a *statement* waits for the write lock before `SQLITE_BUSY`; it does not interrupt a
query that is genuinely slow. And it does not bound the wait at `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`, because the
transaction is begun on the connection rather than through a command — that busy wait comes from the
connection string's `Default Timeout`, 30s by default. Both halves verified.

**`Tracking` and `Listeners` were both absent as knobs that would silently do nothing, and both now
mean something** — see "Session tracking" and "Session listeners".
**`LightweightSession(SessionOptions)` and `OpenSessionAsync` are absent** for a
related reason: tracking is a property of the options rather than a choice of constructor, so
`OpenSession` already *is* the lightweight one, and a session opens its connection lazily so the
second has nothing to await.

**`QuerySession()`'s narrowing is a convention, not a guarantee**, and fisher#30 asked for that to be
decided rather than left implied. It is the same session narrowed to the read interface, so a cast
gets a write handle back; a genuine query-only type would cost a connection per scope to express a
distinction the store does not make. Said on `IQuerySession` itself, and pinned by
`a_query_session_is_the_same_session_type_narrowed` so that making it real is a deliberate change.

### A stray native transaction, and why error 1 escapes everything

`Internal/Sessions/StrayTransaction.cs` (fisher#311). A connection carrying a `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` that
`SqliteTransaction` has lost track of hands the next caller
`SQLite Error 1: 'cannot start a transaction within a transaction'`.

⚠️ **`SQLITE_ERROR` (1) is not transient, and that is what makes this worth closing rather than
retrying.** `FisherResilienceDefaults.IsTransient` declines it — correctly — so it escapes
`SaveChangesAsync` **raw**, and a caller catching `DcbConcurrencyException` or `StreamLockedException`
and retrying gets an unhandled exception instead of the failure they wrote the retry loop against.
fisher#306's translation is gated on transience and deliberately does not reach this.

- **The mechanism was confirmed before anything was fixed, and it reproduces deterministically.**
  fisher#311 was one intermittent on one full-suite run, with two candidate mechanisms that wanted
  *different* fixes, and 36 attempted reproductions in isolation had all come back clean.
  `a_pooled_connection_carries_an_untracked_transaction_forward` settles it with no contention and no
  timing: issue a raw `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`, dispose the connection, open another from the same pool, and
  its `BeginTransactionAsync` throws exactly the reported exception. Microsoft.Data.Sqlite pools a
  connection per connection string and returns it as it was left.
- **The fix is at the source — `OwnedConnectionLifetime` clears the connection before the pool gets
  it.** Only that lifetime, because only a connection Fisher opened is one Fisher returns;
  `ExternalConnectionLifetime` disposing nothing is the whole point of it.
- **Unconditional rather than gated on this session having opened a transaction.** The condition *is*
  that the wrapper has lost track, so anything the session believes about its own transactions is
  exactly what cannot be trusted. One in-process statement per session, not measurable against the
  connection's own open and close — the suite's wall clock did not move.
- **Asking SQLite is the only reliable probe**, since the wrapper is the thing that is wrong and
  `sqlite3_get_autocommit()` has no SQL-level equivalent. `ROLLBACK` *is* the probe: it succeeds when
  there was something to clear and refuses with "no transaction is active" when there was not, which
  is the ordinary case and is swallowed.
- **`FisherSession.BeginWriteTransactionAsync` is defence in depth, not the fix.** It covers the other
  way in, which is where fisher#311's stack actually pointed: attempt N of the resilience pipeline
  opens a transaction, fails, and its rollback on the way out hits the write lock — leaving the
  wrapper marked complete while SQLite's transaction is still open. **Once, and only for that exact
  refusal**: retrying a `BEGIN` in a loop would turn a stuck connection into a hang, and every other
  `SQLITE_ERROR` here means something this cannot fix.
- **Both regression tests plant the state with raw SQL rather than racing into it**, which is the only
  honest shape — a test that waited for the race would be green whether the fix worked or not. Both
  fail against the previous build; the premise test and `an_ordinary_unit_of_work_is_untouched` pass
  either way, which is what they are for.

### Session tracking

`DocumentTracking`, `SessionOptions.Tracking`, `IdentitySession()` / `DirtyTrackedSession()`, and the
`Eject` family (fisher#31). **Almost none of this was new machinery.** Weasel.Storage already ships
the identity-map *and* dirty-tracking closed-shape selectors, `ChangeTracker<T>`, and the
`ChangeTrackers` / `ItemMap` slots on `IStorageSession`; Fisher already had a whole
`IdentityMapFisherStorage<TDoc,TId>` family built and cached in `DocumentProvider<T>` with nothing
able to select it. What was missing was the mode, three one-member subclasses, and the session's half
of change detection.

- **A dirty-tracking storage is its identity-map storage with the selector replaced**, which is one
  overridden member and nothing else. Marten's `DirtyCheckedDocumentStorage` is the same one-line
  subclass, and for the same reason: the difference between the two flavors is entirely what happens
  when a row is *read* — Weasel's dirty selectors do everything the identity-map ones do and
  additionally register a `ChangeTracker<T>` per materialised document.
- **The identity map covers `Query<T>()`, not just `LoadAsync`.** fisher#31 asserted the opposite
  ("the map must be defeated by a query") and it is wrong about Marten, whose documentation says
  plainly: "applied to all documents loaded by Id **or Linq queries**". It falls out rather than being
  arranged — the LINQ provider resolves its storage through `IStorageSession.StorageFor`, so a query
  under a tracking session builds a tracking selector without knowing it did. Raw SQL
  (`AdvancedSql`) does bypass it, resolving the query-only flavor directly, which is also Marten's
  behaviour and for a real reason: a raw query names its own columns and may select no identity at all.
- **Storing a second *instance* under a mapped id throws**, as on Marten. That is the safety property
  the map exists for rather than a caching detail: two instances of one document, both stored, is a
  last-write-wins outcome indistinguishable from a lost update. A type declaring `IEquatable<T>` is
  taken at its word and exempted. A lightweight session keeps no map and does not check.
- **`SessionOptions.Tracking` defaults to `None`, where Marten's `OpenSession(SessionOptions)`
  defaults to its identity map.** Marten's default predates `LightweightSession()`; following it would
  silently give every existing `OpenSession` caller a map they did not ask for, *and* that throw.
- **`LoadManyAsync` preselects out of the map** and asks only for the ids it does not hold. Reference
  identity would survive either way — the identity-map selector returns the cached instance for a row
  it re-reads — so what the preselect buys is the read itself, which is the other half of the point.
  Pinned by deleting the row out of band between the two calls, which is the only way to tell "not
  read" from "read and discarded".
- **`ProcessChangeTrackers` runs before the emptiness check**, because a dirty session's whole point is
  that a unit of work with nothing queued may still have work to do; **`ResetChangeTracking` runs after
  the write and outside the resilience pipeline**, which is fisher#12's property again — re-baselining
  inside a retried delegate would leave the retry comparing against a snapshot it had already taken.
- **Reset has two halves and they fail differently.** Re-baselining stops a second commit rewriting a
  document nothing has touched; registering trackers for documents the unit of work *stored* is what
  makes dirty tracking apply to documents the session created rather than only to ones that pre-existed
  it. The first half is easy to test wrongly: a test that changes a document twice passes without any
  reset at all, because the document really did change both times. It is only observable as somebody
  else's write disappearing, which is what `a_committed_document_is_not_written_again_by_the_next_commit`
  plants. Verified by removing the reset — the two-changes test still passed.
- **A delete by id removes the change tracker as well as the map entry**, and they are not the same
  thing: the map decides what a later load hands back, the tracker decides what the next commit writes.
  A tracker left behind resurrects the row the caller just deleted, with nothing anywhere to report it.
  `RemoveDirtyTracker` is implemented once on the base rather than per flavor, because outside a dirty
  session the tracker list is empty and it returns immediately.
- **`Eject` matches by reference**, so ejecting one instance leaves a queued write made with a
  different instance alone — the distinction the map exists to make. `EjectAllOfType` cannot simply
  drop the map entry: a document hierarchy shares one table and therefore one entry keyed by the
  *base*, so entries whose key is not exactly the type are scanned and matching values removed
  individually. That handles a hierarchy without knowing it is one.
- **`EjectAllPendingChanges` keeps the identity map and clears the change trackers**, which looks
  inconsistent and is not: a tracker is a queued write that has not been asked for yet. Pending DCB
  boundaries go too — a boundary guards appends that are being dropped, so keeping it would fail a
  later commit on behalf of a unit of work that no longer exists.
- **The map's and the tracker list's *contents* are unguarded, and fisher#13 is the reason that needs
  saying.** They are exactly the kind of shared mutable per-session state the operation queue turned
  out to be. The difference is that a tracking mode is only ever chosen by whoever opens the session,
  and the one caller that drives a session from several threads — the async daemon — opens
  `LightweightSession()` everywhere. `the_daemon_opens_untracked_sessions` and
  `concurrent_session_tracker_state.the_daemons_own_sessions_are_untracked` both pin that, so making
  the daemon's sessions tracked has to be a deliberate act. Guarding the contents would also only be
  half a guard: Weasel's selectors hold their own reference to the same dictionary.
  **Their *creation* is guarded**, along with every other lazily-built field on the session — see the
  async daemon section. Not an inconsistency: it keeps the argument above about what the dictionary
  holds, rather than also about whether two callers can end up holding different dictionaries, and it
  costs a lock taken once per session.
- **There is no `QueryOnly` tracking value**, where Marten has one. Marten's names a session that
  cannot write; Fisher has none — `QuerySession()`'s narrowing is a convention — so a mode resolving
  the query-only flavor would make `Store` throw on a session the store hands out as writeable.

### Session listeners

`IDocumentSessionListener`, `Services/IChangeSet.cs`, `StoreOptions.Listeners` and
`SessionOptions.Listeners` (fisher#32). **The hard part was already done**: fisher#4 settled where a
commit hook goes and what the rest of the database can see when it fires, and pinned it by probing
over a separate connection. A session listener is a second client of that seam, and reuses the probe
rather than resettling the question.

- **`AfterCommitAsync` runs outside `StoreOptions.ResiliencePipeline`.** A retried `SQLITE_BUSY`
  re-executes the whole delegate, so a hook invoked inside it fires twice for a transaction that
  already committed. Fourth client of that property after the outbox (fisher#4), the batch's own input
  (fisher#12) and the subscription listener (fisher#21).
- **An enlisted session fires the before hook and not the after one.** "Everyone can see this now" is
  a claim only the caller's commit can make, and Fisher is not told when that happens — the same rule
  the outbox's after-commit hook and the append observer already follow.
- **An empty unit of work fires nothing**, as on Marten. Without it every no-op `SaveChangesAsync`
  would run every store-wide listener.
- **The async daemon's projection batch does not fire session listeners**, and that is a decision. A
  projection batch is the daemon's unit of work, not the application's; firing user listeners for it
  would run an application's `AfterCommitAsync` on the daemon's threads for every batch of every
  shard. JasperFx's `IDaemonChangeListener` is the hook for that side and Fisher already supports it.
- **Pending streams are collected *after* the before hook, where Marten collects them before.** Costs
  nothing, and makes "work queued in the hook joins this transaction" true of appended events as well
  as of documents. Marten's listener that starts a stream is appending to the *next* unit of work.
- **The two synchronous members are default-implemented**, which is both why a commit-only listener
  needs two methods and why a listener written against Polecat's two-member interface compiles here
  unaltered. Marten's `DocumentSessionListenerBase` exists for the same purpose and predates default
  interface members. `DocumentLoaded` / `DocumentAddedForStorage` needed no new seam either —
  `IStorageSession.MarkAsDocumentLoaded` and `MarkAsAddedForStorage` were already called by Weasel's
  selectors and Fisher's storages, and were empty no-ops. The listener list is composed once and
  cached per session, because `MarkAsDocumentLoaded` runs per row.
- **`IChangeSet.Deleted` is `IEnumerable<IDocumentDeletion>`, not `IEnumerable<IDeletion>`.**
  `Weasel.Storage.IDeletion` is already in this codebase, is the storage *operation* that deletes, and
  is referenced unqualified in the very file that builds one — so a second `IDeletion` one namespace
  away is the `DocumentMetadata` collision again. Members are unchanged, so a listener body ports; only
  a declaration naming the type has to be edited.
- **Classification tests `IDeletion` before the role, and that ordering is load-bearing.** Every
  deletion carries `OperationRole.Deletion`, *including the soft form whose statement is an `UPDATE`* —
  so a role-first switch would route by-id deletions through the predicate branch and report every one
  of them with a null id. A predicate delete really does report a null id, because it named no row.
- **`Clone()` returns `this`.** On Marten the change set *is* the live unit of work, which is reset
  after every commit, so retaining one without cloning watches it empty out. Fisher builds it from the
  operations snapshot `TakePendingOperations` already took — the same snapshot the transaction wrote
  from, for fisher#12's reason — so it is immutable by construction. The member is carried so a
  listener that clones out of habit still compiles.
- A patch, a raw `QueueSqlCommand` and an `UndoDeleteWhere` appear in no bucket: none of them carries a
  document, and inventing one would be worse than the omission. Marten is the same.

### Conjoined events refuse a single-tenant aggregate document — fisher#335

`Projections.ProjectionTenancyGuard`, run from `DocumentStore`'s constructor beside
`AssertEveryMappingHasIdentity` and for its reason — the projection and the document's tenancy can be
configured in either order, or by an `IConfigureFisher` contribution, and only then is the answer
final. Marten's rule and Marten's message (marten#5343, "Tenancy storage style mismatch"); the user
ruled refuse over auto-marking.

- **The failure is silent in both directions.** Two tenants may share a stream id under conjoined
  events, a single-tenant snapshot keyed on the id alone holds one row for both, and each tenant then
  reads a document describing the other's stream — no error appending, none reading. The shared
  `inline_and_async_snapshots_of_a_shared_stream_id_stay_isolated_per_tenant` fact found it (fisher#336),
  and **`aggregate_write_cache.the_key_separates_two_tenants_sharing_a_stream_id` had been doing exactly
  this for a year** — the only existing test the guard refused.
- **Refused rather than auto-marked**: marking the document `MultiTenanted()` for the application would
  change an existing table's primary key — a table rebuild on live data — for a configuration nobody
  wrote down.
- **Exempt**: `Live` projections (they write nothing); a multi-stream projection whose `TenancyGrouping`
  is not `RespectTenant`, which is Marten's exemption and is read through `IHasTenancyGrouping`, an
  internal interface the inherited property satisfies; and a type stored by a projection storage
  provider (an EF Core entity), which has no Fisher mapping to judge — that half is fisher#334's.
  Composite projections are walked member by member.
- **Only the leaking direction is refused.** Marten also refuses conjoined documents under single-tenant
  events; that is a mismatch but not a cross-tenant read, and refusing it would break stores for no
  protection.
- **The rest of #335's list is pinned by `conjoined_tenancy_coverage` and `conjoined_tenancy_projections`**
  — bulk insert (and `IgnoreDuplicates` across tenants), patching, soft delete, `HardDeleteWhere`,
  plain/phrase/prefix full-text search, DCB tag queries, a multi-stream projection, a rebuild and a
  `VectorProjection`, each over one identity two tenants share, checked in both directions. **All
  passed first time**: none of it found a bug. They are regression pins for the operations the shared
  `DocumentConjoinedTenancyCompliance` deliberately leaves out of scope.

### Cross-tenant writes

`session.ForTenant(id)` returning an `ITenantOperations` (fisher#33), so one `SaveChangesAsync` writes
several tenants' rows in one transaction. `IDocumentOperations` — everything that queues work, minus
the commit — was split out of `IDocumentSession` to express it, as it is on both siblings.

**This is the one place SQLite's single-writer model is the advantage rather than the constraint.**
The alternative is a session and a transaction per tenant, which on one database file means taking the
write lock N times in sequence and leaves a part-written admin operation if the process dies between
two of them. A database-per-tenant store would need a distributed transaction to match what falls out
here for free.

- **A tenant scope is a real `FisherSession`, not a delegating facade.** Polecat's
  `NestedTenantSession` is 250 lines of one-line delegation, and a delegation site that forgot to pass
  the tenant would be a silent cross-tenant write — fisher#51's exact failure mode. Everything a scope
  does differently is "read a different `TenantId`", and a session already reads its own everywhere, so
  a second session is the version with no per-member correctness to get wrong. `FisherSession`
  therefore implements `ITenantOperations` as well, and `ForTenant` returns one.
- **What is shared and what is not, each way round for a reason.** Shared: the connection lifetime and
  the operation queue — that *is* the feature. Not shared: the `EventOperations`, whose pending-stream
  dictionary is keyed by stream id and would merge two tenants' same-id streams into one; and the
  identity map, change trackers and version tracker, all keyed by document identity, which is unique
  per tenant rather than globally. Shared by delegation: correlation id, causation id, user name and
  headers, which describe the unit of work rather than the tenant.
- **The append path needed nothing.** `AppendPlanner` already wrote `stream.TenantId` rather than the
  session's, so a cross-tenant append works the moment the `StreamAction` is stamped with the scope's
  tenant. `SaveChangesAsync` gathers the scopes' pending streams alongside its own — they are gathered
  rather than queued as operations because planning happens inside the write transaction.
- **`StorageFor<T>` is the single choke point for refusing a single-tenant type**, and it covers every
  read and every write because all of them resolve storage through it. A type without `MultiTenanted()`
  has no `tenant_id` column, so a write "for another tenant" would land in the one shared table and look
  like it worked. `EventOperations.TenantId` is the event-store half of the same rule.
- **Scopes are flattened and cached per tenant.** `ForTenant` twice is the same scope, so its queued
  events are collected once; a scope of a scope is a scope of the session, so the parent has one level
  to walk. `ITenantOperations` deliberately does not offer `ForTenant` — the flattening exists for
  whoever finds the cast.
- **A scope cannot commit and disposes nothing.** `SaveChangesAsync` throws naming `Parent`; `Dispose`
  returns without touching the shared connection, so `await using` out of habit does no harm.
- The scopes' DCB boundaries are checked by the parent inside its transaction, for the same reason
  their operations are written there: a guard checked in no transaction guards nothing.

### Raw SQL

`IDocumentSession.QueueSqlCommand` (write, enrolled in the unit of work) and `session.AdvancedSql`
(read, typed results) — fisher#34. Ported from Polecat's `ExecuteSqlStorageOperation`,
`IAdvancedSql` and `AdvancedSqlResultReader`.

**This is worth more here than the same pair is on either sibling**, and for a structural reason: an
application using Fisher keeps its own tables in the *same file*, and SQLite permits one writer per
file. Without `QueueSqlCommand` its statements and Fisher's are two transactions on one file, so
"my rows and Fisher's, or neither" means taking the write lock twice and contending with yourself.
On Postgres or SQL Server the same method is a convenience.

**`SqliteParameterValue` is the piece with no sibling to port from.** Raw SQL is the one path where a
caller's value reaches a parameter with no conversion in between — every other write path converts
explicitly. Three CLR types bind to something Fisher never wrote, silently. Verified against
Microsoft.Data.Sqlite 10.0.9 and each arm verified load-bearing by removing it:

- **`Guid` binds UPPERCASE.** The recurring trap; matches zero rows.
- **`DateTimeOffset` binds as `2026-08-08 18:45:30.123+00:00`** — space-separated, original offset —
  against `SqliteTimestamp.Format`'s `2026-08-08T18:45:30.123Z`. Worth knowing precisely how this
  fails, because **a one-sided range test does not catch it**: at index 10 the stored form has `T`
  (0x54) and the raw binding a space (0x20), so the stored value sorts after *any* same-date raw bound
  whatever time it names. `a_timestamp_parameter_matches_fishers_stored_form` was written as a `>`
  against an earlier bound first, and passed with the conversion removed. It now asserts equality and
  a bound an hour *after* the event, which without the conversion wrongly includes it.
- **`decimal` binds as text**, which `json_extract`'s REAL never equals. Column affinity rescues the
  comparison against a *declared* column and there is no affinity inside `json_extract` — and that is
  how every undeclared document member is read, so it is the likely case rather than the exotic one.

Everything else is already right and is passed through: bool → INTEGER 1/0, enum → its integer value,
and the rest are what Fisher stores. **A declared `SqliteType` does not coerce the value** — the
provider binds by the CLR type of `Value` regardless — so Weasel's `AppendWithDbParameters` stamping
every placeholder TEXT is harmless rather than a fourth problem. `raw_sql_parameter_binding` pins that
too, because it is provider behaviour Fisher does not own.

Two divergences in the read half, both verified by reverting them:

- **A scalar is read with `GetFieldValue<T>`, not `GetValue` + `Convert.ChangeType`.** Polecat can use
  the latter because SQL Server hands back the CLR type; Fisher stores a Guid as text, and
  `Convert.ChangeType(string, typeof(Guid))` throws `InvalidCastException` outright — `Guid` is not
  `IConvertible`. This is the one Fisher read path that leans on provider coercion *by choice*, where
  `FisherEventsRowReader` converts explicitly. The row readers do so for round-trip symmetry, which
  raw SQL has nothing to protect: the caller names arbitrary columns, including ones Fisher never
  wrote.
- **A document is materialized by its storage's own selector, not by deserializing `data`.** Polecat's
  reader hand-deserializes at an offset and try/catches metadata columns. On Fisher that would be
  silently wrong for a hierarchy: the selectors resolve `doc_type` to the real sub-class, so
  deserializing to the declared type returns the base for every row, missing whatever the sub-class
  added. Swapping the selector for a `FromJson` makes
  `a_hierarchy_comes_back_as_its_real_subclasses` fail.

  The price is that `ISelector<T>.Resolve` reads from fixed positions starting at column 0, so **a
  document can only be the first result type of a query.** Anywhere else throws naming the
  restriction, rather than producing the cast error a misaligned read would.
  `IAdvancedSql.SelectFieldsFor<T>()` exists so a caller does not have to guess which columns to
  select.

**`StreamAsync` runs outside `StoreOptions.ResiliencePipeline`, deliberately.** A retried
`SQLITE_BUSY` re-executes the whole delegate, so a live reader yielded to a caller would resume
against a disposed connection — the property `GetRecentStreamsAsync` documents. Materialising first
would not be streaming, so the trade is that a busy database surfaces to the caller here alone.
`QueryAsync` stays inside the pipeline.

One trap that is SQLite's rather than Fisher's: **a bare `?` that Fisher does not treat as a
placeholder is still SQLite's own anonymous parameter marker**, so it fails with "must add values for
the following parameters" rather than passing through as text. Only a `?` inside a string literal is
safe. That is what the alternate-placeholder overloads are for.

### Soft delete

A document type marked with `[SoftDeleted]`, implementing `JasperFx.Metadata.ISoftDeleted`, or
registered with `Schema.For<T>().SoftDeleted()` gets two columns — `is_deleted` INTEGER 0/1 and a
nullable ISO-8601 `deleted_at` — and `Delete` becomes an `update … set is_deleted = 1` instead of a
`delete from`. `SoftDelete` owns both column names and the SQL that reads and writes them, because
the table definition, the storage and the LINQ layer would otherwise each spell them out.

Ported from Polecat, whose column names these are. What is worth knowing:

- **The load SQL carries the filter, not the caller.** `LoadAsync` / `LoadManyAsync` are reached from
  the session, the projection loader and the daemon alike, so a filter added by callers would present
  as a deleted document coming back to life on whichever path forgot it. The LINQ side gets the same
  filter from `DefaultWhereFragment()` — one source, so the query path cannot drift from the load
  path.
- **Storing a soft-deleted document undeletes it**, and that falls out of the upsert rather than
  being arranged. Weasel's `DocumentSoftDeletedBinder` / `DocumentSoftDeletedAtBinder` bind the *live*
  values on every write, and the `do update set` clause assigns every column from `excluded.*` — so
  the insert branch and the update branch agree without either being written twice.
- **A soft delete guards on `is_deleted = 0`; an undelete guards on `is_deleted = 1`.** Deleting an
  already-deleted document must not push `deleted_at` forward, or `DeletedSince` answers about the
  most recent call rather than about the deletion. Polecat has the guard on its by-id delete but not
  on `DeleteWhere`; Fisher has it on both, and
  `deleting_an_already_deleted_document_leaves_its_deletion_time_alone` pins it against a planted
  timestamp, because two deletes in the same millisecond would agree either way.
- **`DeletedSince` / `DeletedBefore` compare `deleted_at` as text**, with none of the `strftime`
  normalisation a document's own `DateTimeOffset` member needs (fisher#1). The column is
  `SqliteTimestamp`'s fixed-width UTC format, chosen so a string comparison *is* an instant
  comparison — the same property `fi_events.timestamp` relies on. A document member is whatever
  System.Text.Json wrote, which is why that one needs the wrapper and this one does not.
- **A soft-delete operator against a type that is not soft-deleted throws**, in the query layer and in
  `UndoDeleteWhere` alike. There is no column to answer from, so `IsDeleted()` would come back empty
  and `MaybeDeleted()` complete — both of which look like real answers.
- **`ISoftDeleted`'s own members are populated on read**, through the metadata member mapping below
  (fisher#11) — but only where a read can see a deleted row at all. Every ordinary load filters them
  out, so `Deleted` is observably true only through a query carrying `MaybeDeleted()` or
  `IsDeleted()`.

`DocumentWhereOperation` is the criteria-based half — `DeleteWhere`, `HardDeleteWhere` and
`UndoDeleteWhere` differ only in the SQL head they are handed and the guard they carry. The predicate
goes through the same `WhereClauseParser` as `Query<T>()`, and the caller's predicate is applied
*last*, after the tenant scope and the guard, because a compound predicate is parenthesized and so
cannot swallow them.

`TruncateDocumentStorageAsync` stays a real `delete from` — a rebuild's teardown clears rows rather
than flagging them, or the replay would write onto rows it cannot see.

### Duplicated fields

`Schema.For<T>().Duplicate(x => x.Name)` lifts a member into a column of its own and indexes it, so a
predicate against that member is a range scan rather than `json_extract` per row. **The column is a
SQLite `VIRTUAL` generated column, which is the whole divergence** — Marten and Polecat write theirs
on every upsert and refresh them in patch SQL. Three things follow, and they are why it was worth
diverging:

- **It cannot drift from `data`**, because nothing writes it. `Duplicate` can be added to a type that
  already has rows and every one of them is correct at once; a written column would need a backfill.
- **It costs index space, not row space.** `VIRTUAL` computes on read; only the index materialises.
- **The write path is untouched.** No extra binder, no shift in the positional `?` contract
  `SqliteDocumentStorageDescriptorBuilder` maintains. That is why this landed without touching
  document writes at all.

**The generated expression is the member's own `TypedLocator`, taken from `MemberFactory`** — not a
hand-written `json_extract`. That is what makes a duplicated member mean exactly what an unduplicated
one means, and it is what makes a duplicated timestamp work: the locator is the `strftime` wrapper
fisher#1 introduced, so the column holds the normalised fixed-width UTC form, sorts as text and is
indexable. `strftime` over a value (rather than `'now'`) is deterministic enough for a generated
column — verified against 3.51, along with the query plan actually reading `SEARCH … USING INDEX`.

`MemberFactory` swaps in a `DuplicatedMember` when a chain matches a registration, and that member
delegates **everything except `TypedLocator`** to the underlying one. So a duplicated string-stored
enum still refuses to be ordered, a duplicated bool still binds 1/0, and `RawLocator` stays on the
JSON — a null test asks whether the member is present, which is not quite whether the column is null
(an unparseable value yields a null column with the key present), and no index would serve it anyway.

Two things that are easy to get wrong:

- **`pragma_table_info` does not list generated columns; only `pragma_table_xinfo` does.** Weasel's
  delta detection used the former, so every duplicated column read as missing and the migration
  emitted `ALTER TABLE … ADD COLUMN` for it *every time* — and since Fisher runs a migration on the
  first write of each document type per process, the second one failed with `duplicate column name`.
  **Fixed upstream in Weasel.Sqlite 9.24.0** ([weasel#426](https://github.com/JasperFx/weasel/issues/426)),
  which reads `table_xinfo` and filters `hidden <> 1` — so generated columns (2 and 3) come back and a
  virtual table's hidden columns do not. Fisher carried a `DocumentTable.ConfigureQueryCommand`
  override until 9.25.0 and **it is gone**; do not reintroduce it.
  `applying_the_configuration_again_is_a_no_op` is still the test that catches this either way.
- **The declared type is the column's comparison affinity**, so `SqliteTypeFor` is load-bearing
  rather than decorative — declare a numeric member TEXT and it starts sorting as text. `decimal`
  goes to REAL because `json_extract` hands back a REAL for any JSON number, and a column whose
  affinity disagrees with its own expression is the one shape that cannot be right.

The default column name is snake case — `LandedAt` becomes `landed_at`, `Water.Name` becomes
`water_name` — where Marten simply lowercases. Every other column on a Fisher document table is snake
case and a duplicated column sits among them. A name Fisher owns (`id`, `data`, `last_modified`, …)
is refused at configuration time, because SQLite would otherwise report it as a duplicate column at
CREATE TABLE, long after the line that caused it.

`Schema.For<T>()` returns a `DocumentMappingExpression<T>` rather than the mapping, because
`Duplicate(x => x.Name)` cannot infer its document type from a lambda and the receiver has to carry
it — the same reason Marten has `MartenRegistry.DocumentMappingExpression<T>`. The mapping is a
property on it; only what needs the type parameter lives on the expression.

### Configuration layers, attributes, policies and initial data

fisher#39 — the declarative and store-wide halves of configuration: `[Index]`, `[UniqueIndex]`,
`[DuplicateField]`, `[HiloSequence]`, `AddSubClassHierarchy()`, `StoreOptions.Policies` and
`StoreOptions.InitialData`.

**There are now four configuration layers, and their order is the thing to remember.** A store policy,
then the JasperFx metadata interfaces, then the schema attributes, then `Schema.For<T>()` — each
overriding the one before. Weakest first, for a reason that reads off the layer: a policy was written
without knowing about the type it lands on; an interface is intrinsic to the type but says nothing
about this store; an attribute is on the type and about storage; the DSL names the type in this
store's own configuration. The first three run in `DocumentMapping`'s constructor, in that order.

- **The attributes are read where the mapping is created, not by an assembly scan.** A mapping is
  built lazily per type, which is the moment the type is known — so there is no world to scan and
  nothing to keep in sync.
- **Fisher's `[Index]` is deliberately narrower than Polecat's**, which carries `SortOrder`, `Casing`
  and `SqlType`. All three describe a *computed column*, which is what a Polecat index is built over;
  a Fisher index is an expression index and has no column to type, no casing to apply (SQLite's
  default collation is case-sensitive and the LINQ string operators are ordinal to match) and no
  direction worth naming. Carrying them would be three knobs that silently do nothing.
- **Members sharing an `IndexName` become one composite index**, in `GetMembers` order. That is the
  only reason a per-member attribute carries a name at all.
- **`AddSubClassHierarchy()` orders by full name, not by reflection order.** Two sub-classes whose
  default aliases collide have to fail the same way on every run, and `Assembly.GetTypes()` promises
  no ordering — a collision that appeared on one machine and not another would be the worst version of
  that error. Abstract and interface types are skipped, because a discriminator names something a row
  can be read back *as*.
- **`ForDocument<T>` is not `Schema.For<T>()`**, and the difference is the one that matters: it does
  not create the mapping. A type nothing ever stores stays unmapped and gets no table. It means "if
  you store one of these, store it like so".
- **`SeedInitialDataOnStartup()` refuses to be registered before
  `ApplyAllDatabaseChangesOnStartup()`.** Hosted services start in registration order, so the other
  way round writes to tables that do not exist yet — and that presents as `no such table`, which names
  the table and not the mistake.
- **No "already seeded" marker, deliberately.** A seeder that upserts by a known id is idempotent for
  free, which is what every useful seeder does; a marker table would be a table nobody asked for
  holding a claim Fisher cannot verify. Both siblings say the same.

**Partitioning is out of scope permanently, not pending.** Polecat's
`AllDocumentsAreMultiTenantedWithPartitioning()` and its relatives have no SQLite equivalent — no
partition functions, no partition schemes, no per-partition storage. The nearest thing is separate
tables behind a `UNION ALL` view, which carries none of the operational properties (partition
switching, aged-partition drop) that make the feature worth having. Said in `StorePolicies` so it is
not rediscovered as a gap.

### Document foreign keys

`Schema.For<T>().ForeignKey<TOther>(x => x.OtherId)` (fisher#38) — a real, enforced foreign key
between two document tables.

**SQLite's reputation invites the question, so state it plainly: it supports this completely.**
Foreign keys, `ON DELETE CASCADE` and `ON DELETE SET NULL` are all there. Enforcement is
per-connection through `PRAGMA foreign_keys` and off by default *in the SQLite library* — but on for
every connection Fisher opens, because Weasel's default profile sets it. That is the fact fisher#6
discovered the hard way, and it means a document foreign key bites the moment it is declared.

- **The blocker fisher#38 flagged does not exist.** It asked, correctly, whether SQLite accepts a
  `VIRTUAL` generated column as a foreign key *child*, because a "no" would have forced a `STORED` or
  written column and reopened the write-path question fisher#2 closed. **Probed against SQLite 3.50.4
  before anything was built** (the version Microsoft.Data.Sqlite 10.0.9 bundles): the table is
  created, an orphan insert fails, a row whose key is absent from the JSON is allowed, `ON DELETE
  CASCADE` works, and `pragma_foreign_key_list` reports it. So the write path is untouched and a
  foreign key costs index space only.
- **Declaring a foreign key duplicates the member implicitly, and that is a real divergence.** A
  constraint needs a column and a document member lives in `data`; the alternative is an error message
  telling the caller to write a `Duplicate(...)` line with no other purpose. On both siblings the two
  are already separate concepts because their duplicated columns are *written*. Here the column is
  generated, so folding one into the other loses nothing — and an explicit `Duplicate` on the same
  member still wins, because `DocumentMapping.Duplicate` is idempotent. The column is indexed, which
  SQLite wants anyway: without an index on the child column every parent delete scans the child table.
- **The referenced side is always the other type's `id`.** SQLite requires a foreign key to reference a
  `PRIMARY KEY` or `UNIQUE` column, and a document table's identity is its primary key. Referencing a
  duplicated field would need that field's index to be `UNIQUE`.
- **A document whose member is absent or null is unconstrained**, because `json_extract` yields SQL
  NULL and SQLite exempts a NULL child. Same asymmetry as a `UNIQUE` index over an absent member.
- **The referenced table is named unqualified, and that is forced rather than chosen.** SQLite's
  `REFERENCES` clause cannot be schema-qualified — and Fisher folds its logical schema into the table
  *prefix* rather than using real schemas, so the rendered name is already the whole name and two
  logical stores in one file each reference their own table.
- **`DeleteAllDocumentsAsync` now orders by foreign key, referencing tables first** — fisher#6's lesson
  one layer over. The order comes from `pragma_foreign_key_list` rather than from the store's
  configuration, so it is the database's account of what references what: a table left behind by an
  earlier configuration is still enforced and the store no longer knows about it. Verified by removing
  the ordering. `CompletelyRemoveAllAsync` still needs none — SQLite does not enforce a key against a
  dropped table.
- **A self-reference is refused at configuration time.** Not because SQLite minds, but because the only
  shape that wants one (a tree) has no insert order that satisfies the constraint for its own root.

Adding a foreign key to a type whose table already exists means recreating the table: SQLite has no
`ALTER TABLE ADD CONSTRAINT`, and Weasel reports that rather than attempting it.

### User-declared indexes

`Schema.For<T>().Index(x => x.Name)` / `.UniqueIndex(...)` (fisher#16) — an index over a member,
created as a **SQLite expression index** rather than as an index over a column. That is the whole
divergence, and it makes the feature cheaper on Fisher than on either sibling: Marten needs a computed
index and Polecat a `JSON_VALUE` index, both of which materialise something first, while SQLite has
indexed expressions (since 3.9, restricted to deterministic ones — `json_extract` qualifies). So the
member is indexed where it lives and the table's shape does not change.

This is what makes `Duplicate` and `Index` two different things rather than near-duplicates:

- `Duplicate` materialises a `VIRTUAL` generated column **and** indexes it — for when the member
  should also be a column something else can name.
- `Index` indexes the expression only. No column, no affinity to declare, nothing added to the table.

- **The indexed expression is the member's `TypedLocator`, from the same `MemberFactory` a query goes
  through.** SQLite's planner uses an expression index only when the query's expression matches the
  index's, so an index built from a hand-written `json_extract` is created without error, never used,
  and reports nothing. A timestamp is the case that proves it: its locator is fisher#1's `strftime`
  wrapper, so a bare `json_extract` index would not serve the range predicates a timestamp index
  exists for. Verified by swapping `TypedLocator` for `RawLocator` — the index is still created and
  `the_planner_uses_a_declared_index_for_a_timestamp_range` fails.
- **Indexing a member that is also duplicated indexes the generated column**, because a
  `DuplicatedMember`'s `TypedLocator` *is* the column name. Not special-cased; it falls out of reading
  the locator. The same swap makes this one regress to `json_extract` too, which
  `indexing_a_duplicated_member_indexes_the_column` catches.
- **The index name mirrors Weasel's own formula** — `idx_<table>_<members>` — repeated rather than
  called, because `DbObjectName.ToIndexName` is internal to Weasel.Sqlite. Deliberately
  indistinguishable from a duplicated field's index in `sqlite_master`: which mechanism created one is
  Fisher's business, not the reader's.
- **A `UNIQUE` index does not constrain documents missing the member.** `json_extract` yields SQL NULL
  for an absent key and SQLite treats NULLs in a unique index as distinct. Same as both siblings, and
  pinned because it is the kind of thing a reader assumes the opposite of.

Indexes go through Weasel's migration like every other schema object, so `AutoCreate.None` is honoured
for free and the table is not created lazily on first write.

### Document hierarchies

`Schema.For<TBase>().AddSubClass<TDerived>()` (fisher#17) — a base type and its sub-classes share one
table and one identity space. `Store(derived)` and `LoadAsync<TBase>(id)` share a table,
`Query<TBase>()` returns every sub-class as its own type, `Query<TDerived>()` narrows to one.

**The discriminator is a short alias in its own `doc_type` column, not `dotnet_type`.** Worth stating
because `dotnet_type` is already on every row and looks like the obvious candidate — it is not. It
holds an assembly-qualified name (long, not worth indexing, brittle across an assembly rename) and is
written by Weasel's `DocumentDotNetTypeBinder`, which takes no alias resolver. The binder built for
this job is `DocumentDocTypeBinder`, and it does. Both siblings keep the columns separate.

Weasel.Storage already had the rest: `DocumentStorageDescriptor.ResolveDocumentType`,
`docTypeReadIndex`, and a full set of `Hierarchical*ClosedShape*Selector` types. Fisher supplies the
mapping, the column, and the sub-class storage.

- **A sub-class must never acquire a mapping of its own**, and `DocumentSchema.BaseMappingFor` is what
  stops it — checked *before* the mapping cache, not after. Without it `Store(derived)` reaches
  `MappingFor(typeof(Derived))`, creates a mapping, and writes to `fi_doc_derived`: the sub-class is
  registered, carries an alias, and still lands in the wrong table. Verified by removing it — all
  three sub-classes get tables of their own.
- **`SubClassFisherStorage` wraps the base's storage rather than being built from the mapping.** The
  descriptor's selectors materialise a row as whatever its discriminator says, which only type-checks
  against the base; the wrapper downcasts through `CastingSelector`.
- **Writes delegate untouched.** `DocumentDocTypeBinder` resolves the alias from `document.GetType()`,
  so the base's write operations already stamp a derived instance with its own alias.
- **The two narrowing paths are different on purpose.** A query is narrowed in SQL; a load by id is
  narrowed in memory, by testing what came back. A load names one row and the id is unique across the
  hierarchy, so a discriminator predicate would only turn "that id is a different sub-class" into the
  same answer as "no such id".
- **The query filter is added once per statement, not inside `FilterDocuments`.** Two ways to get this
  wrong, and both were hit: composing it into `FilterDocuments` repeats it per caller predicate *and*
  omits it entirely from a query with none; hanging it off the soft-delete branch omits it for a type
  that is not soft-deleted and for the `DeletedOnly` / `MaybeDeleted` scopes of one that is. It is an
  `in` over the aliases at or below the queried type rather than an equality, because a sub-class may
  have sub-classes — Polecat emits a bare equality, correct only two levels deep.
- **A sub-class's default alias follows `DocumentMapping.Alias`'s convention, not snake case.** The
  base type's discriminator alias *is* its `Alias` — the one the table is named from — so a sub-class
  spelled differently would put two conventions in one column.
- **An unknown alias throws rather than falling back to the base.** A row written by a deployment that
  knew a sub-class this one does not is a real configuration gap; deserializing it as the base hands
  back an object quietly missing whatever the sub-class added. Deliberately the opposite of the event
  reads' policy, which skip an unresolvable `dotnet_type` — an event store must stay readable by a
  deployment that does not know every event, where a document load has one right answer.
- **An abstract or interface base is a hierarchy with nothing registered**, so its table carries the
  column from the first migration. Adding it later would leave the rows already written with no
  discriminator to read.

### Numeric revisions

`Schema.For<T>().UseNumericRevisions()`, or implementing `JasperFx.IRevisioned` (fisher#18) — an
INTEGER `revision` column as the alternative to `guid_version`, with `Store(doc, revision)`,
`UpdateRevision` and `TryUpdateRevision` on the session. The two concurrency styles are
**alternatives**: a type carries one column or the other, and `AssertConcurrencyIsCoherent` refuses
the pair rather than letting the descriptor pick one silently.

Weasel.Storage already had the whole numeric path — the descriptor's `revisionBinder` slot was
reserved and Fisher was passing null — so this is dialect SQL plus wiring, not new machinery.

- **The semantics are Marten's, deliberately, and they have a sharp edge.** `Store` passes the
  document's own `Version` as the expected revision (Marten's docs: "`Store()` is essentially
  `UpdateRevision(entity, entity.Version)`"), and the guard requires the supplied revision to be
  **strictly greater** than the stored one. So re-storing an instance that still carries the revision
  it was written at is a `ConcurrencyException`, not an increment — `UpdateRevision(doc, Version + 1)`
  or resetting `Version` to 0 (auto) is the way forward. Polecat diverged to an equality rule for its
  bespoke pipeline's parity; following it here would mean writing SQL the shared operations do not
  describe, and would silently disagree with Marten about what an explicit revision means.
  `storing_an_instance_that_carries_its_current_revision_is_rejected` pins it, message and all.
- **The trailing slot count is decided by which statement is being built, not by `guarded`.** This is
  the trap, and it bit during development. `NumericClosedShapeUpsertOperation` binds **four** trailing
  slots unconditionally (two for the SET case, two for the guard); `NumericClosedShapeOverwriteOperation`
  binds **two**; the update binds two. `guarded` is false under Numeric — it means "Optimistic" to its
  caller — so reading it produced a two-slot upsert for a four-slot binder, which surfaces as an
  `IndexOutOfRangeException` from inside Weasel that names nothing of Fisher's. Hence the explicit
  `isOverwrite` flag.
- **The revision binder occupies two client-side slots**, not one, in every insert-shaped statement:
  `case when ? = 0 then 1 else ? end`. Both get the same value.
- **`revision` is a separate `MetadataColumn` from `Version`**, because the two carry different CLR
  types — Guid and int — and `MetadataColumn` refuses a member that cannot hold its value. Sharing one
  slot would mean either dropping that check or making it lie.
- **A numeric revision is always read back, mapped member or not**, where a Guid version is dropped
  from the query-only projection. Asymmetric on purpose: the revision a caller will guard the *next*
  write with is the one the database just computed, so a read that withheld it would leave every
  explicit store guessing.
- **The column is INTEGER, and that is load-bearing.** A TEXT affinity would sort revision 10 below
  revision 9 and turn the "must be greater" guard into nonsense.

- ⚠️ **The expected revision is a parameter, never read back off the document** (fisher#228). It used
  to be the latter — `Store<T>(T, int)` set `IRevisioned.Version` and the operation then read that
  member back — which made **both** halves conditional on the document implementing `IRevisioned`. So
  for a type that opted in through `Schema.For<T>().UseNumericRevisions()` the supplied revision was
  dropped on the floor and the operation guarded on `0`, which means auto: `UpdateRevision(doc, 7)`
  stored the next auto-increment value, a backwards write was accepted, and `TryUpdateRevision`
  dropped nothing — **a silent lost update, in the method whose whole purpose is to prevent one.**
  The two routes into numeric revisions are documented as equivalent, and only the interface one
  worked.
  - **The mode is read off the *operation*, not off the mapping.** Only the numeric operations
    implement `Weasel.Storage.IRevisionedOperation`, so that is the one source which cannot disagree
    with the statement actually being built; `DocumentMapping.UseNumericRevisions` would be a second
    answer to the same question, free to drift from it.
  - **`Insert` and `Update` keep the fallback and need nothing else**, having no explicit-revision
    overload — which is why `CaptureExpectedRevision` still exists, with the revision optional.
  - **No shared suite reaches this, and jasperfx#819 §2 established that none can.** It proposed
    running `NumericRevisionCompliance`'s nine facts a second time against a type declared through
    `Schema.For<T>().UseNumericRevisions()` — exactly this asymmetry. It was written and run against
    Fisher: **seven of the nine failed, and not because of a bug.** Every fact works by setting the
    document's revision before `Store` and reading it back off a load, and the declared route has no
    member to do either with — Fisher's own DSL test says so outright ("no `IRevisioned` member to
    project onto, so the value lives only in the column"), and Marten is the same shape. So the suite
    could never run on the store whose bug motivated it, and it needs the mapped-member seam §3
    deferred, which Fisher has nothing to bind to — `DocumentMetadataExpression<T>` exposes `Version`
    and no `Revision`. `DocumentComplianceConfig.UseNumericRevisions<T>()` ships anyway as the half a
    `Type` alone can carry, with the finding recorded on it.
    `NumericRevisionCompliance` itself is enrolled and green (fisher#250) through the interface route.
    Fisher's own coverage did not reach the DSL route either:
    `a_type_configured_through_the_dsl_gets_the_same_column` asserted the column existed and
    auto-incremented, and stopped there. The four `a_dsl_configured_type_*` tests are the
    interface-route guard tests one for one, against a type that opted in the other way, so the
    property under test is that the two routes agree.

`0` means auto — increment whatever is stored — which is the sentinel the shared operations bind when
no revision was named, and why every guard starts with `? = 0 or`.

⚠️ **A projected `IRevisioned` document's revision is the stream version, not a write count**
(fisher#369). The projection storage used to upsert with revision 0, so the column counted writes: one
save of two events stored 1, `LoadAsync` projected that 1 onto `Version`, and the body — stamped with the
stream version by JasperFx's `AggregateVersioning` — said 2, as did a LINQ `Select`, Marten and Polecat.
`ProjectedWrites.For` now **overwrites** with the explicit revision and `IgnoreConcurrencyViolation`,
Marten's `StoreProjection` shape: the last event's version for a single-stream projection, its sequence
for a multi-stream one.
- **Both entry points, because the inline path does not reach `StoreProjection`.** JasperFx's
  `ApplyInline` calls `Store(snapshot, id, tenantId)` with no last event, so that path reads the revision
  off the snapshot's own `IRevisioned.Version`, which the fold has already stamped. The async daemon
  reaches `StoreProjection` and uses the event.
- **An overwrite, not an upsert with a revision**, because the strictly-greater guard would refuse a
  replay writing the value the row already holds. That is also why `RebuildSingleStreamAsync` goes
  through `FisherSession.StoreProjected` now: after this change the stored revision equals the rebuilt
  aggregate's, and an ordinary `Store` threw `ConcurrencyException` repairing an intact row.
- **A `UseNumericRevisions()` type with no `IRevisioned` member keeps the write count** — it has no
  `Version` in its body or on a member, so there is nothing for the column to disagree with.

### Session metadata on documents, and `MetadataForAsync`

`Storage/Metadata/` gained five opt-in columns and `IQuerySession.MetadataForAsync` (fisher#29). The
event store already copied the session's correlation id, causation id and user name onto every
appended event; a document written in the same unit of work got none of it, so an application could
answer "which request wrote this event" and not "which request wrote this document".

**Weasel.Storage already had every binder** — `DocumentCreatedAtBinder`, `DocumentCorrelationIdBinder`,
`DocumentCausationIdBinder`, `DocumentLastModifiedByBinder`, `DocumentHeadersBinder`,
`DocumentTenantIdBinder`. This is wiring, not machinery, which is what the issue hoped and rarely is.

- **`created_at` needs no exception to the `excluded.*` rule, and the obvious implementation does.**
  The upsert's `do update set` assigns every column in the *write list* from `excluded.*`, so a
  `created_at` contributed by a write binder moves forward on every save. Adding it and then carving
  it out of the set clause is the shape that suggests itself; instead the column is filled by its own
  parenthesized `NowDefaultExpression` DEFAULT and the binder is added to `readBinders` only. It is
  then in no INSERT column list and no set clause, and nothing has to remember why.
  `created_at_survives_an_update_and_last_modified_does_not` fails when it is made a write binder,
  which was verified.
- **`tenant_id` is read-only for a different reason**: it is part of the primary key and the storage
  operations bind it inline ahead of the binder loop, so a write binder would be a second writer of a
  value that already has one. Enabling its metadata column creates nothing — `MultiTenanted()` does
  that — so it decides only whether the value is projected back onto a member.
- **The four session-sourced binders are appended after every existing write binder**, which is what
  keeps the positional `?` contract intact: a new client-side slot at the end shifts nothing above it.
- **Only the opt-in columns get an `Enabled` flag, and `MetadataColumn.Enable` throws on the others.**
  Whether `guid_version`, `revision`, `is_deleted` and `deleted_at` exist is already decided by
  `UseOptimisticConcurrency()`, `UseNumericRevisions()` and `SoftDeleted()`, and `last_modified` is
  always there — so a second flag over any of them would be a knob that silently does nothing. Marten
  puts `Enabled` on all of them; `OptionalMetadataColumnExpression` is what keeps the DSL from
  offering it where it would mean nothing. **Mapping an optional column enables it**, since a mapping
  onto a column that would not exist is configuration that silently does nothing too.
- **Turning an enabled column back off throws.** A column is created by the migration and dropping one
  that may hold data is a migration, not a configuration flag.
- **`MetadataForAsync` is hand-built rather than routed through LINQ**, which is the second place in
  Fisher where going around the implicit filters is correct (bulk insert's duplicate probe is the
  other). The LINQ path applies the soft-delete filter, and a soft-deleted row's metadata is exactly
  what a caller asking "when was this deleted" wants — no ordinary load can answer it. The tenant term
  stays. Columns are chosen from the mapping rather than selected blindly, because naming one the
  table does not have is `no such column` rather than a null.
- **The returned type is `Fisher.Metadata.StoredDocumentMetadata`**, not `DocumentMetadata` as on both
  siblings: Fisher already has a `DocumentMetadata` one namespace away doing the opposite job (which
  columns are mapped onto which members), and two same-named types with opposite jobs is a collision
  that only gets noticed by whoever imports the wrong one. Every optional value on it is nullable,
  where Polecat's constructor requires `CreatedAt` — here null means "the column is not on this table",
  and a default `DateTimeOffset` would be indistinguishable from a real one.
- **`IDocumentSession` now declares `CorrelationId` / `CausationId` / `CurrentUserName` / `Headers` /
  `SetHeader`.** They were public on `FisherSession` and on no interface, so setting one meant casting
  to an internal type — tolerable while only events read them, wrong once a document does.

### Document metadata member mapping

`Storage/Metadata/` — which of a document's own members Fisher's metadata columns are projected onto
when a row is read. Every column is written either way; mapping only decides whether the value comes
back out, which is what makes `ISoftDeleted`'s `Deleted` / `DeletedAt` mean something rather than
being an opt-in marker (fisher#11).

Three ways to say it, each overriding the one before: the JasperFx metadata interfaces (`ISoftDeleted`,
`IVersioned`), the `Fisher.Attributes` metadata attributes, then `Schema.For<T>().Metadata(...)`. The
first two are conventions applied when the mapping is created; the DSL runs afterwards.

- **Four columns of the five, because `dotnet_type` has nowhere to go.** Weasel's
  `DocumentDotNetTypeBinder` takes no member where every other binder does, so `DocumentMetadata`
  omits it rather than offering a mapping that would silently do nothing. That is an upstream gap, not
  a Fisher decision.
- **Adding a mapping widens the SELECT**, because a binder is added to `readBinders` only when its
  column is mapped — an unmapped binder returns before touching the reader, so carrying it would cost
  a column per row to accomplish nothing. The read ordinals are `FirstMetadataColumn + index` into
  that array and `FisherDocumentStorage`'s select list is built from the same array in the same order,
  so **the two stay aligned only while both are derived from it**. Nothing should ever append to one
  without the other; `AddIfMapped` exists so there is one place that does both.
- **`IVersioned` turns optimistic concurrency on**, as it does on both siblings. Not a liberty: with
  it off the `guid_version` column is neither written nor read, so mapping a member onto it would mean
  nothing. The converse does not hold — `UseOptimisticConcurrency()` alone maps nothing, because there
  is no member named.
- **A mapped version stays in the query-only projection.** It is normally dropped there, since a
  query-only load has no version tracker to feed; once a member reads it, dropping it would make
  `Query<T>()` and `LoadAsync` disagree about what the document holds.
- **The interfaces are resolved through the interface map, not by name.** An explicitly implemented
  `ISoftDeleted.Deleted` is a private member called `Fisher.…ISoftDeleted.Deleted`, which neither
  `GetProperty("Deleted")` nor a scan of public members finds — and a document is free to have a
  public `Deleted` of its own meaning something else.
- **A bad mapping is refused at configuration time**, with the column named. `LambdaBuilder.Setter`
  would otherwise throw when the document's storage is first built — on first use, a long way from the
  line that caused it, and in a message about expression trees. Same discipline as
  `DuplicatedField.AssertColumnNameIsAvailable`.

The read path leans on Microsoft.Data.Sqlite's coercion rather than converting explicitly, which is
the one place Fisher does — `DocumentVersionBinder` reads `GetFieldValue<Guid>` over lowercase
canonical TEXT, `DocumentSoftDeletedBinder` reads `GetFieldValue<bool>` over INTEGER 0/1, and the two
timestamp binders read `GetFieldValue<DateTimeOffset>` over `SqliteTimestamp`'s fixed-width UTC text.
Those are Weasel's binders and Fisher does not own them. `metadata_column_coercions` pins all four
against the exact shapes Fisher stores, without any of the mapping machinery in the way, so a provider
upgrade that changes one fails there and names the column instead of presenting as a member that
quietly stopped being populated. All four hold as of Microsoft.Data.Sqlite 10.0.9, including a Guid in
either casing.

#### The version guard reads the document, not only the session — fisher#245

⚠️ **Fisher's Guid optimistic concurrency used to work only inside one session, and that is what this
mapping is now also for.** The guard is fed from `IStorageSession.Versions` — what *this session read*
— so a document loaded in one session and stored through another had no entry and **failed its guard
every time**. Correct about staleness and useless for the workflow the feature exists for: load in one
request, save in the next. `UseOptimisticConcurrency()` was promising something it could not deliver.

`FisherSession.SeedExpectedVersion` is **Marten's `storeEntity`**, deliberately: same dispatch, same
two call sites — `Store` and `Update`, never `Insert`, which writes a new row and has no stored version
to be checked against.

- **One seam covers both ways of declaring a version, and that falls out of this section rather than
  being arranged.** `DocumentMetadata` already maps `IVersioned.Version` onto the version column by
  convention, exactly as Marten's `VersionedPolicy` does — so the interface route and
  `Metadata(m => m.Version.MapTo(...))` arrive at storage identically, and
  `FisherDocumentStorage.MappedVersionFor` (weasel#590's seam) reads one member for both. **The
  asymmetry between them is what marten#5372 was**; here there was nothing to be asymmetric, because
  Fisher consulted neither. Both were broken identically, which is why
  `cross_session_optimistic_concurrency` asserts every fact for both routes — a fix seeding only one
  would look right against whichever route a test happened to use.
- ⚠️ **`MappedVersionFor` returns `Guid?`, not `object?`.** Declaring it `object?` compiles, does not
  implement the interface member, and leaves the throwing-free default returning null — so the whole
  feature silently does nothing and every test still fails in the way it did before the change. That is
  how the first cut of this went, and the only signal was the tests staying red.
- **The `Guid.Empty` condition is carried for parity and is not observable.** Measured, not assumed:
  removing it changes no outcome in either direction, because an expectation of `Guid.Empty` matches no
  stored version — a blank version inserts over a missing row and raises `ConcurrencyException` over an
  existing one either way. It stays because Marten's dispatch has it, and **no test pins it**,
  deliberately, rather than a test being written that would pass with it gone.
- **A successful write moves the instance's own version on**, which is what makes seeding safe to do on
  every store: without it, storing the same instance twice in one process would seed the second write
  with the version the first superseded. Pinned, because the first draft of the mapped-member test got
  this wrong and read as a product bug.
- **The numeric half needed nothing**, and the reason is worth keeping: `CaptureExpectedRevision`
  already reads the document (fisher#228), which is why revisions crossed sessions while Guid versions
  did not. There is no mapped-revision route to miss either — `DocumentMetadataExpression<T>` exposes
  `Version` and **no `Revision`**, so `IRevisioned` is the only way to declare one, and weasel#590's
  `MappedRevisionFor` has nothing here to adopt it for.

⚠️ **No shared suite reached any of this, for any store — and that is what fisher#250 closed.** The
whole shared coverage of document concurrency was `NumericRevisionCompliance`, which is numeric-only
and written against `IRevisioned` throughout; every other "optimistic" fact in the shared set is about
the *event store* (`AppendOptimistic`, `FetchForWritingByTags`), and grepping the 2.68.0 `Suites/`
directory for `IVersioned` returned nothing at all. **Fisher passed all fifty enrolled suites with this
broken** — the jasperfx#700 / #718 / #732 pattern again, a capability all three stores are assumed to
share with nothing shared holding any of them to it.

`GuidOptimisticConcurrencyCompliance` (jasperfx#819, JasperFx 2.69.0) is the suite this section would
have been caught by, and Fisher enrolls it green against the fix above. Its shape is worth knowing:
**each "it works" fact has an "and staleness is still refused" twin**, because the cheap wrong fix —
seed nothing, or seed whatever the row currently holds — makes one half pass and the other fail, and a
suite carrying only the first half would have blessed exactly that. Fact 4 is the one Fisher is the
reference for: a successful write **moves the stored instance's own `Version` on**, so the same
instance can be stored again without tripping its own guard.

⚠️ **`FisherDocumentComplianceFixture`'s `OptimisticConcurrencyTypes` replay is load-bearing for other
stores and a no-op for Fisher**, which is exactly why it is there rather than skipped. The suite's
document implements `IVersioned` *and* the config declares the type, because the stores disagree about
whether the marker is itself the opt-in or merely supplies the member to guard on. On Fisher the marker
*is* the opt-in — `DocumentMetadata`'s conventions turn it on, as Marten's `VersionedPolicy` does — so
dropping the loop leaves all five facts passing and nothing announcing that the config was ignored.
Verified by dropping it.

**`UpdateExpectedVersion<T>(T, Guid)` is still absent**, where Marten has it as the Guid counterpart of
`UpdateRevision`. Not needed for the above — seeding off the document covers the ordinary flow — and
not added here; it is the separate case of guarding against a version the caller knows and the document
does not carry.

### Strong-typed identities

`Storage/StrongTypedId.cs` and `Storage/ClosedShape/StrongTypedIdentification.cs` (fisher#14) — a
wrapper struct or class standing in for one of the four canonical id types, as an aggregate's identity
and as a document's. The shape is JasperFx's, described by `ValueTypeInfo.ForType`: one public gettable
property, plus a matching constructor or a static builder.

**This needed no new seam.** `IIdentification<TDoc, TId>` already reserved `ToRawSqlValue`,
`RawSqlType` and `ReadIdFromReader` for exactly this, so a wrapper presents its inner value at the
ADO.NET boundary while the document keeps the wrapper. Nothing downstream knows the id was wrapped —
the table shape, the write SQL and the positional `?` contract are untouched.

- **Fisher discovers wrappers rather than requiring registration**, which is Polecat's model rather
  than Marten's — so nothing depends on `StoreOptions.RegisterValueType<T>()`, which exists anyway
  (fisher#75) for the reason polecat#459 gives: **store configuration ought to be portable**, and a
  shared block that reads `opts.RegisterValueType<AlertId>()` on two stores should not have to drop the
  line for the third and explain the omission in a comment. **It is not an accepted no-op**, and that
  is what makes it worth having rather than merely tolerable: discovery must treat "not a wrapper" as
  the ordinary answer, since it is asked about every candidate identity member of every type, whereas
  naming a type here is an *assertion* — so the same answer becomes a configuration error, reported
  with the type named rather than surfacing later as "has no identity member" from a place that cannot
  mention the wrapper. `StrongTypedId.Register` is the throwing half of `TryResolve`, and it tells a
  bad *shape* apart from a good wrapper around an inner type Fisher cannot store. The compliance
  seam's `RegisterValueType<T>` now delegates to it rather than staying empty, so the suite exercises
  the method a consumer would call.
- **`DocumentIdentity.FindIdMember`'s predicate overload is the whole entry point.** Its default
  accepts only the canonical four; the overload exists so a store can widen it, and
  `StrongTypedId.IsSupportedIdType` is Fisher's. Before this, every strong-typed aggregate failed with
  "has no identity member", which was true only in the sense that the filter had rejected it.
- **`ValueTypeInfo.ForType` throws for anything that is not a wrapper**, and it is asked about every
  candidate identity member of every type. The answer is cached including the negative, and cheap
  exclusions run first, or resolving an ordinary aggregate's identity would raise and swallow an
  exception every call.
- **Everything about the column derives from `DocumentMapping.StoredIdType`, not `IdType`.** The
  column holds the inner value; the wrapper exists only in .NET. Deriving from the wrapper gives an
  int-backed id a TEXT column and a Guid-backed one the wrong `StorageColumnType` — **and no
  compliance suite catches either**, because the suite only uses Guid- and string-backed wrappers,
  where TEXT happens to be right. `strong_typed_identities` pins it.
- **A Guid-backed wrapper goes through the same lowercase-canonical conversion as a raw one.** That
  conversion lives in the identity strategy rather than the dialect (`SqliteGuidIdentification`), so
  the wrapper is exactly where it could have been quietly lost — and the compliance suite would not
  have seen it, because it never reads the row.
- **Generation mirrors the raw strategies**: version-7 Guid, or the document type's Hi-Lo sequence. A
  string-backed wrapper generates nothing, because a raw string key is externally assigned too.

- **A LINQ `Select` of a wrapper is converted to the inner type and then wrapped** (fisher#351). The
  projection materializer (`FisherQueryProvider.CoerceTo`) knew enums, timestamps and Guids and handed
  everything else to `Convert.ChangeType`, which cannot build a wrapper — so `Select(x => x.Id)` threw
  `InvalidCastException` for every strong-typed id, while loading the whole document worked because the
  serializer builds it. `StrongTypedId.Wrap` caches one compiled constructor-or-builder delegate per
  wrapper type. It covered the identity only, and fisher#356 finished the job.
- ⚠️ **A REGISTERED wrapper is serialized as its primitive** (fisher#356, the user's ruling over the
  alternative of teaching every locator about `$.x.value`). `StoreOptions.RegisterValueType` records
  the type on the store, and `ApplyValueTypeConverters` adds `ValueTypeJsonConverterFactory` to the
  serializer's options from `DocumentStore`'s constructor. That is the first moment the serializer is
  final, since `ConfigureSerialization` replaces it wholesale. From there `MemberFactory` types a
  registered wrapper as its inner primitive (`ValueTypeMember`), unwrapping only the comparison value,
  which Microsoft.Data.Sqlite refuses to bind otherwise. `x.Captain.Value` resolves to the same column,
  and so does `c => c.Value` inside `Any` over a collection of wrappers.
  - **Registered only, never discovered.** Discovery answers "has the shape", which many ordinary
    single-property types do, and rewriting their JSON because they happened to fit is not Fisher's
    call. The identity is the exception on the READ side: `IdMember` unwraps any wrapper, registered or
    not, because the id column holds the inner value either way.
  - **Reading accepts the old `{"value":…}` form**, so registering on a live store needs no migration.
    LINQ still sees the old shape in rows nobody has rewritten.
  - **A type carrying `[JsonConverter]` is skipped.** A converter in `JsonSerializerOptions.Converters`
    outranks a type-level attribute, so claiming the type would silently override Vogen's or
    StronglyTypedId's converter.
  - **Read-only options are refused by name.** If something serialized with the options before the store
    was built, they cannot take a converter, and a silent skip would leave LINQ quietly broken.

`LoadAsync<T, TId>(id)` is the load-by-wrapper overload. Both type parameters are explicit, which is
what keeps it unambiguous against the four single-parameter overloads.

### Hi-Lo sequences

Numeric document identities go through `Storage/Sequences/`: `fi_hilo` (one row per sequence),
`HiloSequence` over the shared `Weasel.Core.Sequences.HiloSequenceBase`, and `SequenceFactory` as the
store's `ISequenceSource` — which is what `FisherDatabase.SequenceFor` delegates to and what the
shared `HiloIntIdentification` / `HiloLongIdentification` strategies resolve through.

Three things worth knowing:

- **Advancing the hi is one statement, not read-then-compare-and-swap.** Marten calls a stored
  function; Polecat reads `hi_value`, updates it guarded by the value it just read, and retries when
  the row moved. SQLite's upsert does the whole thing atomically —
  `insert … on conflict (entity_name) do update set hi_value = fi_hilo.hi_value + 1 returning
  hi_value` — so there is no window to lose. The retry loop that survives in `HiloSequence` is there
  only to honour the base class's "a negative hi means try again" contract.
  `concurrent_stores_never_hand_out_the_same_id` pins it: six stores over one file with `MaxLo = 5`
  must between them produce exactly 1..300, no duplicates and no gaps. Rewriting the advance as a
  read followed by an unguarded update fails it every run.
- **The sequence creates `fi_hilo` itself.** An id is assigned inside `session.Store(document)` —
  `IIdentification.AssignIfMissing` is synchronous and returns before any commit — so the commit-time
  `EnsureDocumentTablesAsync` path is far too late. `HiloFeatureSchema` also puts the table in the
  store's migration, but only when a registered mapping actually has a numeric id; the runtime does
  not depend on that having run. `AutoCreate.None` is honoured in both places.
- **`AdvanceToNextHiSync` is not an oversight.** It exists because `AssignIfMissing` is synchronous,
  and it runs through `StoreOptions.ResiliencePipeline` exactly as the async path does — otherwise
  half of all `fi_hilo` access would skip the SQLITE_BUSY retry.

Sequences are cached by sequence *name*, not by document type, so two types sharing a configured
`SequenceName` share one allocation instead of each holding a private lo range over the same row.

### DI registration

`AddFisher(...)` (fisher#20) — `FisherServiceCollectionExtensions`, plus `ISessionFactory` and two
hosted services. The store is a singleton, sessions are scoped, and the returned
`FisherConfigurationExpression` carries the two opt-ins: `ApplyAllDatabaseChangesOnStartup()` and
`AddAsyncDaemon(mode)`. Deliberately smaller than either sibling's — no multi-store
`AddFisherStore<T>`, no `IConfigureFisher` chain, no initial-data seeding.

- **`DaemonMode.HotCold` is refused, and it is a real limitation rather than an omission.** Hot-cold
  failover means several nodes competing for one leadership lease through the database, and a Fisher
  store is a file that SQLite does not make safe to share across nodes. Accepting the mode and running
  Solo would give an application the opposite of the guarantee it asked for — every node projecting at
  once. `Solo` starts the daemon; `Disabled` and `ExternallyManaged` register nothing.
- **The WAL warning moved to where somebody sees it.** `BuildProjectionDaemonAsync` has warned about a
  non-WAL journal since the daemon landed, but only a consumer building a daemon by hand ever saw it.
  The hosted service puts it in the application log at startup. Still a warning rather than a refusal:
  a non-WAL store projects correctly, just serialised against its writers.
- **`AutoCreate.None` wins over `ApplyAllDatabaseChangesOnStartup()`.** The hosted service starts and
  does nothing, rather than the registration being the thing that quietly overrides schema policy.
- **The host-level `JasperFxOptions` is read in `Configured`, which is one call where the siblings
  need two** (fisher#141). `JasperFxOptions.EnableAdvancedTracking` is documented as telling *all*
  Critter Stack tools to opt in and is what a CritterWatch host sets; Fisher had
  `Events.EnableExtendedProgressionTracking` and read `JasperFxOptions` **nowhere**, so the same host
  configuration lit up Marten and Polecat and silently did nothing here. Silent in the direction that
  hurts: a console showing no per-shard state is indistinguishable from a store with none to report.
  - **Every registration path already funnels through `Configured`**, primary and ancillary alike, so
    "and the ancillary stores too" holds by construction. Marten and Polecat each call their
    equivalent at two sites because their two paths are separate, and a third path added there is a
    third place to remember.
  - **After the `IConfigureFisher` chain, not before**, so a per-store instrumentation default cannot
    clobber the host's opt-in. `the_host_opt_in_outranks_a_store_level_contribution` pins it and is
    the only test that fails when the call is moved.
  - **One-way.** A false `EnableAdvancedTracking` is the default rather than a statement, so it must
    not turn *off* a store that opted in for itself — which a plain assignment would do.
  - **`JasperFxOptions.ApplicationAssemblyReuseWarning` is surfaced from `Configured` too**
    (fisher#142), where the siblings log it from an always-registered startup activator. All three of
    Fisher's hosted services are conditional — `ApplyAllDatabaseChangesOnStartup`,
    `SeedInitialDataOnStartup`, `AddAsyncDaemon` — so a plain `AddFisher` has no startup hook at all,
    and registering an unconditional one for a single rare warning would change what every consumer's
    container holds. `Configured` already runs exactly once per store with the container in hand.
    JasperFx only *detects* the condition and says plainly that consumers surface it, so a warning
    nobody prints is a warning that does not exist.
    - **Once per container**, keyed on the `JasperFxOptions` instance through a
      `ConditionalWeakTable`. Several Fisher stores share one host condition and would otherwise each
      repeat the same four-sentence warning. **A process-wide flag would be worse than the noise it
      saves**: the warning exists *because* a second host started in this process, so suppressing
      repeats globally would silence it for precisely the host that needs it.
      `a_second_host_in_the_same_process_gets_its_own_warning` is that half.
    - **The value is planted by reflection in the tests, and that is the right amount of test.** The
      setter is internal to JasperFx and reproducing the real condition needs two hosts from two
      assemblies in one process in a fixed order — an intermittent under xUnit's parallel collections
      rather than a test. What is Fisher's to get right is read it, buffer it, log it once; detecting
      it is JasperFx's and is tested there.

#### Container-scoped projections and subscriptions — fisher#194

`AddProjectionWithServices<T>(lifecycle, lifetime)` and `AddSubscriptionWithServices<T>(lifetime)`, on
`FisherConfigurationExpression`, on `FisherStoreConfigurationExpression<T>`, and as bare
`IServiceCollection` extensions for a modular monolith registering from a module rather than from the
composition root. `IFisherRegistrable` is the static-abstract dispatch, mirroring `IMartenRegistrable`
— which wrapper a projection needs depends on what *kind* of projection it is, and only its base class
knows.

**Almost none of this is Fisher's, and that is the finding rather than the shortcut.**
`JasperFx.Events.Projections.ContainerScoped` already carries `ScopedProjectionWrapper<,,>`,
`ScopedAggregationWrapper<,,,,>` / `ScopedSingleStreamAggregationWrapper<,,,,>` and the non-generic
`ScopedAggregationWrapper.Build(...)` factory, all public and all generic over the store's session
pair. So Fisher closes them over `IDocumentSession` / `IQuerySession` and writes no wrapper at all.
**Polecat has no equivalent surface**, so Fisher is the second store to have this rather than the
third.

- **Scope lifetime is the design, and the shared wrappers settle it: one `IServiceScope` per unit of
  work.** An async projection outlives every request scope by construction — it runs from a hosted
  service where there is no request — so a wrapper that resolves once and holds is reaching into a
  disposed provider by its second batch, and one that opens a scope and keeps it leaks a scope per
  registration for the life of the process. The wrappers open, resolve, use and dispose inside each
  inline `ApplyAsync`, each daemon page and each slicing pass, holding nothing across a boundary.
  That is also why `Transient` is treated as `Scoped` rather than refused: the wrapper resolves afresh
  per batch either way, so the two lifetimes describe the same behaviour.
- **The scopes come from the root provider**, which is what `IConfigureFisher` hands the callback and
  what the store is built from. A scope created from a scoped provider is a child of something that
  gets disposed.
- **Both paths land on Fisher's own `Add(ProjectionBase, lifecycle)`, where Marten's equivalent calls
  the base graph's `Add(IProjectionSource, ...)`.** That overload is what sweeps `PublishedTypes()`
  into the schema, so a container-scoped projection's document table is created with the rest of the
  migration. Through the narrower one the projection would work against a table that was never
  migrated — the silent half of fisher#111, reached from a new direction.
- **The subscription wrapper is Fisher's, and that is a gap rather than a choice.**
  `JasperFx.Events.Subscriptions.ScopedSubscriptionServiceWrapper` exists, is generic over the session
  pair, and is `internal` with nothing in the library referencing it — so no consumer can reach it, and
  Marten carries its own copy for the same reason. `Subscriptions/ScopedSubscriptionWrapper.cs` is
  Fisher's, and its constructor copies the inner subscription's `Name`, `Version`, `Options` and event
  filtering across, because it is the *wrapper* the daemon reads those from. Dropping them is how a
  scoped subscription silently loses a batch size or a `SubscribeFromPresent()` its constructor set —
  marten#4318, found the hard way over there.
- **A `Singleton` registration is the projection itself, with no wrapper**, which is correct whenever
  its dependencies are singletons too. A bare `IProjection` is wrapped in `ProjectionWrapper` *here*
  rather than at the graph, so the caller's `configure` lambda can reach the name and filtering surface
  a raw `IProjection` does not have.
- **The load-bearing tests count scopes, not results.** A projection that merely works passes every
  correctness assertion written against a single commit and then fails on the second daemon batch, so
  `a_scoped_projection_gets_one_scope_per_unit_of_work` counts creations *and* disposals — a wrapper
  that opened a scope per batch and kept it passes the first half and leaks — and
  `a_scoped_projection_runs_under_the_async_daemon` deliberately commits a second batch after the
  daemon has already run one.

#### The store-derived Event Model rung — fisher#251

`AddFisher` registers a `JasperFx.Events.EventModeling.ProjectionEventModelSource` (jasperfx#825), and
`AddFisherStore<T>` registers one of its own. One `SlicePattern.View` slice per registered projection —
event → projection → read model — read straight out of the store's own registry.

**The gap was that nobody derived from the store.** Bobcat declares slices and Wolverine derives Command
and Automation slices from its chains, so a View slice reached an Event Model canvas only when a human
had written one down. Yet the store knows it exactly: every registered projection, the document it
produces, and the event types its `Apply` / `Create` / `Evolve` methods take.

**Almost none of this is Fisher's, and that is the finding rather than the shortcut.** The source reads
`IEventStore.TryCreateUsage()` and `SubscriptionDescriptor`, which Fisher already fills through shared
code in `JasperFx.Events` — so the applied-event set cannot disagree with `AggregateDescriptor.AppliedEvents`,
because the same reader feeds both. What is Fisher's is two registrations.

- **Why a store registers this rather than the library doing it.** A store registers itself under its
  own interface, and `AddFisher` is the only place that knows which — hence the resolver overload.
  Fisher's `DocumentStore` implements `IEventStore` **explicitly** (fisher#45), so the cast is what
  reaches it; `IDocumentStore` does not carry the member.
- ⚠️ **The ancillary registration unwraps the marker proxy, and that is load-bearing.** A
  `DispatchProxy` implements only the interfaces it was asked for, so an ancillary store's marker is
  *not* an `IEventStore` — the same reason the `IEventStore` bridge reaches through it. Verified by
  handing the proxy over: `InvalidCastException: Unable to cast object of type 'generatedProxy_1'`.
  Better than a silent omission and still not a failure to rely on.
- **Each store's source carries a `Subject` of its own** (`event-model://projections/<marker>`), which
  is why the ancillary one is registered through `AddEventModelSource` rather than
  `AddProjectionEventModelSource`. Same distinction `FisherSystemPart<T>` draws for the command line,
  and it matters more here for the same reason: two Fisher stores are usually two *files*. **The two
  sources agree on a model NAME and differ by Subject** — slices are grouped by model name before
  merging, and an ancillary store's read models belong on the same canvas as the primary's.
- ⚠️ **Which canvas that is, is the caller's to say, and hardcoding the default was fisher#271.** The
  reasoning above is right about *which store* and says nothing about *which name* — so a host calling
  `AddEventModel("Stoat", …)` got **two** assembled models, its own and one called `EventModel`, with
  neither carrying both halves. Reported from Stoat, whose spec suite went 18/18 → 15/18 on a version
  bump alone: `Expected exactly one assembled model, but got [Stoat, EventModel]`, which points at
  nothing in Fisher.
- ⚠️ **The name is `StoreOptions.EventModelName`, and it is read LAZILY — fisher#276 replaced
  fisher#271's answer within hours of shipping it.** 1.8.0 took it as an optional `eventModelName`
  parameter on all five `AddFisher` / `AddFisherStore<T>` overloads. Two things were wrong with that,
  and the second is the one worth keeping:
  - **An optional parameter on an existing public method breaks binary compatibility.** It binds at
    the call site, so the caller's IL hard-codes the full signature and an assembly that is not
    recompiled throws `MissingMethodException` — while its source still compiles, which is what makes
    it quiet. Marten has a standing rule against it: new configuration goes on `StoreOptions`, which
    is additive. **It is not additive at the source level either** — on Marten, giving the
    parameterless `AddMarten()` an optional string made it a *better* overload match than
    `AddMarten(connectionString)` for a lone string argument, because C# prefers the candidate with no
    omitted optionals. Every such call silently rebound, the connection string landing in the model
    name; 10 CI failures, all `No tenancy is configured!`, no ambiguity error anywhere. Fisher has no
    parameterless `AddFisher()` and so dodged that one, which is luck rather than design.
  - ⚠️ **"The store cannot infer the name" was never a fact about the problem.** fisher#271 recorded
    it as one — in this file, in the release notes, and in a test comment added by fisher#274 — on the
    grounds that `AddEventModel` may not have run when `AddFisher` does. That is true and irrelevant
    once the name is read at *assembly* time instead of *registration* time.
    `FisherProjectionEventModelSource.TryCreateAsync` resolves the store and reads its options there,
    so `AddEventModel` may be called either side of `AddFisher`. `the_registration_order_does_not_matter`
    pins both orders, because a source that went looking early would pass one and fail the other.
- ⚠️ **The fallback is the SERVICE name, not the literal `EventModel` (fisher#280), and that is the
  actual fix for fisher#271 rather than a third iteration of it.** `ProjectionEventModelSource.DefaultModelName`
  is `"EventModel"`, which is the one default guaranteed to be wrong for every host — every other
  contributor to a canvas defaults to something meaningful (Wolverine's chains and HTTP endpoints to
  the service name, a Bobcat spec assembly to its own name, a curated file to its
  `model:` value), so the overwhelmingly common host — Wolverine plus one store — assembled **two**
  models out of the box and every host had to restate a name it had already declared. fisher#271
  threaded a name through the registration and fisher#276 moved it to `StoreOptions`; both fixed the
  symptom. The chain is now `EventModelName` → `ServiceName` → the literal.
  - **`GetService`, never `GetRequiredService`.** A bare `ServiceCollection` with no JasperFx
    registration is an ordinary shape rather than a misconfiguration — it is what most of Fisher's own
    tests build — and the literal is the right answer for it.
  - **A blank service name falls through rather than naming a model nothing**, the same reason
    `StoreOptions.EventModelName` refuses whitespace from its setter. It cannot be *refused* here,
    the value being the host's rather than Fisher's, so it is ignored.
  - **Resolved lazily, like the name itself**, so `JasperFxOptions` may be registered either side of
    `AddFisher`.
  - ⚠️ **`ServiceName` here is `JasperFxOptions`', and until wolverine#4448 that was NOT the name a
    Wolverine host gives itself** (fisher#284). `WolverineEventModelSource` names its model from
    `WolverineOptions.ServiceName`; `WolverineOptions.ReadJasperFxOptions` did
    `ServiceName ??= jasperfx.ServiceName` and nothing carried the value back — so
    `opts.ServiceName = "Ledgers"` left `JasperFxOptions.ServiceName` at **its** default, the entry
    assembly name, and the canvas split in two exactly as it did before #280. **The paragraph above
    was written on the premise that the two agreed, and they did not**; it now says "the service name"
    rather than naming the property, because which property that is has never been Fisher's to assert.
    - **It only ever looked correct because the two defaults coincide.** A host whose assembly is
      named what its service is named agrees with itself by accident — which is why this survived, and
      why the coverage that would catch it needs a host where the two differ. That test lives in
      Wolverine (`service_name_reaches_jasperfx_4448`), since Fisher references neither Wolverine nor
      a host that sets a Wolverine service name.
    - **Fixed upstream rather than here, and deliberately.** The alternative was Fisher reaching for
      `WolverineOptions` by loose type lookup — Fisher does not reference Wolverine — three times over,
      once per store. Wolverine now writes its resolved `ServiceName` into `JasperFxOptions`, so all
      three stores inherit it and this fallback is correct as written.
    - **`StoreOptions.EventModelName` remains the reliable answer** for a host that wants to be sure,
      and is what a consumer should set rather than depending on two defaults lining up.
- **`FisherProjectionEventModelSource` composes rather than subclasses**, `ProjectionEventModelSource`
  being `sealed`. It owns the three things Fisher alone knows: which service the store is registered
  under, where the name came from, and which store the slices came from (the `Subject`). It resolves
  through `IDocumentStore` — which the ancillary marker proxy implements, so `Options` is reachable
  without unwrapping — and unwraps only for the `IEventStore` cast, which a `DispatchProxy` cannot
  satisfy because that interface is implemented explicitly (fisher#45).
- **An empty or whitespace name is refused by the setter**, null meaning the default. It is a legal
  model name that reproduces the exact bug with a blank where the name should be. On a property this
  refuses at the line that set it; the 1.8.0 parameter had to hoist its guard above four registrations
  to avoid leaving a half-populated `IServiceCollection` behind a catchable exception.
- **This was not Fisher-only.** Marten (marten#5405 → marten#5407) and Polecat (polecat#618) had the
  identical trap and have taken the identical `StoreOptions` answer, which is the other half of
  fisher#276's point: one spelling across the three, so store-agnostic docs and samples read alike.
- `a_store_left_on_the_default_assembles_a_second_model` pins the bug as the behaviour it remains
  for a store nobody names, because asserting only that a *named* store lands on the named model
  passes against a store that ignores the setting entirely.
- **The slice is named after the DOCUMENT, not the projection**, which is what makes it *merge* with a
  spec-declared slice of the same name into one slice carrying both a `Derived` and a `Declared` claim.
  A mis-named slice would not merge, which is the one thing the source exists to get right.
- **Fisher matters disproportionately here, which is why jasperfx#825's acceptance names it.** A
  store-derived Event Model that needs a Postgres or SQL Server container to demonstrate is one nobody
  exercises while writing the feature. Every fact in `event_model_source` runs against a throwaway
  SQLite file.
- **A View slice's `ConsumedEvents` is what the aggregate declares an `Apply` for, and nothing else** —
  but only since JasperFx 2.69.1. It used to carry `Archived` and `Compacted<T>` too, because
  `AppliedEvents` is derived from `IAggregateProjection.AllEventTypes` and every aggregation projection
  handles those whether the aggregate declares an `Apply` or not: correct about what the projection
  *handles*, and two orange stickies for events the application never wrote on a canvas. Reported as
  jasperfx#829 and filtered upstream in `ProjectionEventModelSource.ToSlice` rather than in the reader
  that fills `AppliedEvents`, since a monitoring console asking "what does this projection handle"
  wants both and only the canvas question is narrow.
  **Pinning the exact set rather than asserting around it is what made the fix visible on the bump**,
  which is the argument for pinning an upstream behaviour you have just filed an issue about.

**There is no `event-model` CLI command in JasperFx 2.69.0**, so jasperfx#825's third acceptance item
is covered at the seam a command would read — `EventModelDiscovery.AssembleAsync` over a plain Fisher
host, with no Bobcat reference anywhere.

#### The command-line seam — fisher#172

`AddFisher` registered the store, sessions and its hosted services, and **nothing the JasperFx or
Weasel command line looks for** — so `dotnet run -- db-apply` failed with *"No Weasel databases were
registered in this application"*, `resources list` reported an application with no resources, and a
CI step asserting the deployed schema still matches the code was not expressible at all.

**Two registrations, because the two command families resolve different things**, and registering one
leaves the other reporting an empty application:

| Surface | Resolves | Fisher supplies |
|---|---|---|
| `resources setup/list/check`, `AddResourceSetupOnStartup()`, `describe` | `JasperFx.CommandLine.Descriptions.ISystemPart` | `FisherSystemPart` / `FisherSystemPart<T>` |
| `db-apply` / `db-assert` / `db-patch` / `db-dump` | `Weasel.Core.Migrations.IDatabaseSource` | `FisherDatabaseSource` |

- **An adapter rather than widening `ITenancy`**, following polecat#501's reasoning. Marten satisfies
  the Weasel half because its own `ITenancy` *is* an `IDatabaseSource`; Fisher's `ITenancy` is public
  and implementable outside this repo, so extending it is a breaking change — and it would pull a
  migration contract into a tenancy abstraction for what is purely a CLI concern. Nothing was needed
  underneath: `FisherDatabase` already extends Weasel's `SqliteDatabase`.
- **Both take a factory, never the resolved store.** The `IConfigureFisher` chain has to have run
  before the tenancy means anything, and that happens on first `IDocumentStore` resolution — so
  injecting the store would build it while the container is still being assembled.
- **Both refresh a `DynamicTenancy` first.** A tenant nothing has resolved yet still has a file to
  migrate, and `db-apply` silently skipping it is the exact failure the whole seam closes. Read
  through `ITenancy` rather than the store's internal `RefreshTenantsAsync`, because an ancillary
  store arrives as its marker `DispatchProxy` and is not a `DocumentStore`.
- **An ancillary store gets its own subject uri** (`fisher://iotherstore`), and that matters more here
  than on either sibling: a second Fisher store is usually a second *file*, so collapsing the two
  would hide one from `resources list` outright rather than merely mislabelling a schema.
- **Neither ancillary registration unwraps the proxy**, unlike the `IEventStore` bridge beside them.
  Correct rather than an oversight: both reach the store through `IDocumentStore` members (`Tenancy`,
  `Options`), which a marker interface inherits and the proxy therefore implements — where the tooling
  interfaces are implemented explicitly and are not on `IDocumentStore` at all.

**`AssertDatabaseMatchesConfigurationOnStartup()`** is the third opt-in, beside
`ApplyAllDatabaseChangesOnStartup()` and `SeedInitialDataOnStartup()`, over a new
`IDocumentStore.AssertDatabaseMatchesConfigurationAsync` that spans every tenant database.

- **The two schema opt-ins are refused together, in either order.** Applying the changes at startup
  makes the assertion a check on the schema that same startup just wrote, so a host asking for both is
  expressing a contradiction rather than being careful — and accepting it silently would leave
  somebody believing they had a guard they do not have.
- **`AutoCreate.None` is deliberately not consulted**, where the migration activator honours it. That
  setting says the schema is not Fisher's to change and this changes nothing — declining to *verify*
  because the store was told not to write would make the strictest configuration the one with the
  fewest guarantees.
- **A seeder may follow either activator.** What `SeedInitialDataOnStartup` needs is that the tables
  exist by the time it runs, and an assertion that passed is exactly that claim.

**The tests run the commands rather than asserting on the container**, and that is the point: a
registration test passes against a source that resolves, enumerates nothing and reports success —
which is `db-assert` answering "everything matches" about a store it never looked at. They needed a
`ConsoleWritingCollection`, because `Console.SetOut` is process-wide and `CliJsonCapture` was already
swapping it; two tests printing JSON objects at once made the existing `event_query_command` capture
parse somebody else's report. Same family as the process-wide `ActivityListener` lesson in tracing.

#### Previewing a migration programmatically — fisher#210

fisher#172 closed the **command-line** half of "preview and assert": `db-patch` writes the outstanding
DDL to a file, `db-assert` fails a build against a drifted database, and
`AssertDatabaseMatchesConfigurationAsync` / `AssertDatabaseMatchesConfigurationOnStartup()` put the
assertion on the store and on the host. **What it did not give an application was the delta as an
object**, so the two questions a deployment actually asks — *is there anything outstanding*, *what
exactly would change* — meant shelling out to the CLI. `ToDatabaseScript()` cannot answer either: it
describes the configuration and never looks at the database in front of it.

`AdvancedOperations` is where they land, beside `ToDatabaseScript` / `WriteCreationScriptToFileAsync`,
which is what Marten hangs off `IMartenStorage` and Fisher already hangs off `Advanced`. **No new
store-level interface**, because `IDocumentStore.Advanced` is already declared — a second facade would
be a parallel place for the same five members to be reached through.

| Marten's `IMartenStorage` | Fisher | Where it came from |
|---|---|---|
| `AssertDatabaseMatchesConfigurationAsync` | `store.AssertDatabaseMatchesConfigurationAsync` | **fisher#172** |
| `ApplyAllConfiguredChangesToDatabaseAsync` | `store.ApplyAllConfiguredChangesToDatabaseAsync` | original |
| `ToDatabaseScript` / `WriteCreationScriptToFile` | `Advanced.ToDatabaseScript` / `WriteCreationScriptToFileAsync` | fisher#42 |
| `CreateMigrationAsync` | `Advanced.CreateMigrationAsync` | fisher#210 |
| `WriteScriptsByType` | `Advanced.WriteScriptsByTypeAsync` | fisher#210 |
| `AllObjects` / `AllSchemaNames` | `Advanced.AllObjects` / `AllSchemaNames` | fisher#210 |
| — | `Advanced.WriteMigrationFileAsync` | fisher#210 (`db-patch`'s programmatic form) |

**Every one of them is Weasel's, inherited through `FisherDatabase : SqliteDatabase : DatabaseBase`.**
That is the finding rather than the shortcut, and it is the same shape fisher#120 had: nothing about
the gap was dialect-specific, so no decision existed to prompt anybody to look — the members had been
on the database object the whole time and were reachable only by naming `store.Database`.

- **`CreateMigrationAsync()` is the default database, and the two tenant-aware members exist because
  that is not the whole store.** Marten's carries the same restriction and documents it; here
  `CreateMigrationAsync(tenantId)` names one file and `CreateAllMigrationsAsync()` returns one
  migration per database identifier. Collapsing N tenants into one answer would report about whichever
  file came first — the same reason `ApplyAllConfiguredChangesToDatabaseAsync` reports per database and
  `TenantMigrationException` names which tenants are current. Dynamic tenants are refreshed first, so a
  tenant nothing has resolved yet is still previewed.
- **An unknown tenant throws**, through `Tenancy.DatabaseFor`, rather than quietly previewing the
  default — the rule every other tenant-scoped member on `Advanced` follows, and the one that stops a
  per-tenant deployment check from silently checking the wrong file.
- ⚠️ **`AllSchemaNames()` is always `["main"]` here, and is deliberately not reinterpreted.** SQLite
  has one schema and Fisher folds `DatabaseSchemaName` into the table prefix instead, so the isolation
  between two logical stores in one file is a prefix this method cannot see. Answering with the prefix
  or with the logical schema name would make the member mean something different here than it means on
  Marten, which is worse than a constant a caller can read. `the_schema_names_are_always_main` pins the
  constant under both a default and a named schema so it reads as a decision.
- **The tests apply what they preview.** A delta object with the right `SchemaPatchDifference` whose
  rendered DDL does not run would pass every shape assertion, so
  `the_migration_file_is_ddl_that_actually_creates_the_schema` executes the patch file against the real
  database, reads `sqlite_master`, and then asserts the store agrees nothing is outstanding — which is
  what says the patch was the *whole* delta rather than part of it.
- **Computing a delta is a read**, so it is available under `AutoCreate.None` — the deployment most
  likely to want it, and the one where a preview that emitted DDL as a side effect would be a bug.

**Everything Fisher hands a container now implements `IDisposable` as well as `IAsyncDisposable`** —
`DocumentStore`, `FisherDatabase`, `FisherSession`, and `IQuerySession` with them. That is not a
politeness: a `ServiceProvider` disposed synchronously **refuses outright** to dispose a service
offering only `IAsyncDisposable`, with "type only implements IAsyncDisposable". Since `AddFisher`
registers sessions scoped, the async-only shape made a scoped session unusable rather than merely less
efficient — which is why this surfaced the moment there was a container at all. `SqliteConnection` and
`DbDataSource` both supply the sync form, so nothing blocks. Marten's `IDocumentStore` and
`IQuerySession` declare both for the same reason.

### `IDocumentStore`

`DocumentStore`'s own public API, extracted as an interface (fisher#45) so application code depends on
the abstraction and `AddFisher` can register both. It declares `IDisposable` **and**
`IAsyncDisposable` for exactly the reason above — an interface declaring only the async form would
reintroduce fisher#20's bug one level up, where it is harder to see.

- **The tooling surfaces are deliberately not on it.** `IEventStore`, `IEventStore<,>` and
  `ISubscriptionRunner<>` are implemented **explicitly**, so they are private members and a consumer
  casts to reach them. That is the whole point of implementing them explicitly, and re-exposing one
  through `IDocumentStore` would undo it. `the_tooling_interfaces_are_not_re_exposed` pins it, because
  "add it to `IDocumentStore` too" is the natural-looking fix for a cast somebody finds awkward.
- **`DocumentStore.For(...)` stays static on the concrete class and keeps returning `DocumentStore`**,
  mirroring Marten. `AddFisher` registers the concrete type *and* the interface against one singleton;
  the concrete registration stays so existing code keeps resolving.
- **The surface is pinned by reflection in both directions.**
  `every_public_instance_member_of_the_store_is_on_the_interface` fails, naming the member, when a
  public member is added to one and not the other — verified by adding one. Its filter is
  `BindingFlags.Public`, which is correct rather than merely convenient: an explicit implementation is
  a private member, so the tooling surfaces are excluded by the same rule that makes them explicit.
  `the_store_implements_every_interface_member_implicitly` checks the other direction through the
  interface map, so a member satisfied explicitly — compiling fine and then unreachable from the
  concrete type — is caught too. **Both had to learn about the document contract below**: the store's
  session-factory members are satisfied by default interface implementations on `IDocumentStore`
  itself, and a DIM that explicitly implements a base interface member is a *private* method on the
  interface — so the second test's filter is `IsPublic` on the **interface** method, separating a
  promise from a forwarder. `the_store_is_the_shared_document_session_factory` pins the forwarders
  directly, since they are excluded from the map walk and would otherwise be pinned by nothing.

### The store-agnostic document contract

`JasperFx.Events.Documents` (fisher#68 / jasperfx#647), shipped in JasperFx 2.47.0 — the document
slice a store-agnostic consumer needs alongside the event store, and the first half of what
`Wolverine.Fisher` and a Fisher-backed CritterWatch are built on. Three session tiers, a session
factory and a query-execution hook; seven operations at 2.47.0 and **eight from 2.49.0**, measured off
CritterWatch's actual call sites rather than designed as a document-store facade.

#### `Events` on the session contracts — the non-covariance trap

jasperfx#669 (JasperFx 2.50.0) added an `Events` accessor to both document session tiers:
`IQueryEventStore Events` on `IDocumentReadOperations`, narrowed to `IEventStoreOperations Events` on
`IDocumentSessionOperations`. It is the store-agnostic route from a session a consumer opened through
`IDocumentSessionFactory` to that session's event store.

⚠️ **Both carry a throwing default, and Fisher's pre-existing `Events` did NOT satisfy either.** C#
interface implementation is not return-type covariant: `IQuerySession` and `IDocumentSession` both
declare `Events` as Fisher's concrete `EventOperations`, which *implements* `IEventStoreOperations` but
does not *implement the member*. The near-miss binds to the throwing default with **no compile error
anywhere**, and nothing notices until a caller holds the session as the contract — which is the only
caller the accessor exists for. Two explicit implementations on `FisherSession` close it, and
`document_session_events_compliance` is what proves them closed. Deleting them still compiles.

⚠️ **A second, louder consequence:** `IDocumentSession` now reaches an `Events` down two unrelated
branches — `IQuerySession`'s and `IDocumentSessionOperations`' — and neither hides the other, so every
`session.Events` in the tree became CS0229 ambiguous on the bump. `IDocumentSession` re-declares
`new EventOperations Events { get; }` to resolve the lookup. That declaration looks redundant and is
not.

⚠️ **The compliance suite appends by string stream key throughout**, and Fisher's default — like every
sibling's — is Guid, which refuses every append in the suite by name. The suite now *says* so:
`DocumentComplianceConfig.StreamIdentity` (jasperfx#672 / fisher#98) is nullable, defaults to null
meaning "leave the store on its own default", and `FisherDocumentComplianceFixture` replays it exactly
as it replays `ValueTypes`. **What that replaced was an inference made in the fixture** — string
identity whenever the config declared *event types* — which was right only because
`DocumentSessionEventsCompliance` was the one suite populating `EventTypes`, and would have silently
mis-configured the first Guid-keyed event suite to arrive. A precondition a config cannot carry is one
each fixture has to guess, and a correct store then fails an undeclared requirement.

#### `PendingStreams` — the same trap one member over

jasperfx#673 (JasperFx 2.51.0) added `IReadOnlyList<StreamAction> PendingStreams` to
`IDocumentSessionOperations`: the stream actions a session has queued and not yet committed, for code
that did **not** do the appending — a listener, or a pre-commit hook deciding something from what is
about to be written. Code at the call site already has the `StreamAction`, because `StartStream` and
`Append` return it. fisher#96 is Fisher's half, and it is an explicit implementation on `FisherSession`
beside the two `Events` ones.

- **Fisher is the store most exposed to the non-covariance trap here**, because it already has a member
  *named* `PendingStreams` — on `EventOperations`, returning `IReadOnlyCollection<StreamAction>` over
  `_streams.Values`. That is not the contract's `IReadOnlyList<StreamAction>`, so had that shape ever
  been put on the session it would have bound to the throwing default with no compile error anywhere.
  The default **throws rather than answering empty**, deliberately: empty is indistinguishable from a
  session with nothing pending, so a silent default would discard a consumer's derived work with a
  clean build and green tests.
- **The forward copies, and both reasons are worth keeping.** The types differ, so a copy is forced;
  and the native collection is a *live* view of the tracking dictionary, so a caller holding it across
  another append watches it change. The contract permits either and tells a caller wanting stability to
  copy — doing it here is what makes every caller's answer stable rather than the ones who read that
  remark.
- **Tenant scopes are included**, where `EventOperations.PendingStreams` is per-scope by construction.
  `SaveChangesAsync` commits the scopes' streams in the same transaction and `ChangeSet` already
  reports the two together; a hook told "this is what is about to be written" and handed only the
  default tenant's would be wrong about the commit it is bracketing. Each action carries its own
  `TenantId`, and a scope holds no scopes of its own, so reading it from one reports that tenant alone.
- **Not added to Fisher's own `IDocumentSession`.** `session.Events.PendingStreams` is the native
  spelling and predates the contract; a second public member of a different type saying the same thing
  is how the two would drift.

`pending_stream_actions_compliance` (9 tests) is the definition; `pending_stream_actions` covers the
two decisions above, which a suite written against three stores has no vocabulary for.

#### `LoadAsync<T>(object)` — the eighth operation

jasperfx#665 added `Task<T?> LoadAsync<T>(object id, …)` to `IDocumentReadOperations`, and fisher#89
is Fisher's half. **It is not a compile break**: the member ships with a default implementation that
unboxes a `Guid` or a `string`, forwards to the existing overload, and throws `NotSupportedException`
for anything else — so the bump is clean on its own and what tells you the member is only half-present
is the compliance suite, not the compiler.

- **`LoadAsync<T, TId>` does not satisfy it**, different arity, so the contract falls to the default.
  Fisher carries both. The two-parameter spelling keeps its own reason for existing — both type
  parameters explicit is what keeps it unambiguous against the four single-parameter overloads.
- **Declared on `IQuerySession` as public API rather than implemented explicitly**, matching Marten and
  Polecat, so a consumer moving between the stores meets one spelling. The four canonical overloads are
  more specific and still win overload resolution, so no existing call site moved.
- **The trap is the canonical case, not the strong-typed one.** The overload is reached by a caller
  holding *any* identity in an `object`-typed local, so an implementation that assumed a wrapper passes
  the two strong-typed facts and silently regresses the boxed-`Guid` one.
  `the_object_overload_resolves_canonical_identities_too` exists for exactly that, and the default gets
  it right for free — which is what makes an override the only way to break it.
- **`CoerceIdentity` is where the three shapes are decided**: exact match, wrapper-from-inner (through
  `StrongTypedId`, so it agrees with how the identity was discovered in the first place), and integral
  widening. The last is narrow on purpose — an untyped literal is an `int`, so refusing it against a
  `long`-keyed document would refuse a difference the caller cannot see, while a general
  `Convert.ChangeType` would turn `"12"` into an id and hide a real mistake.
- **The wrapper half is what let fisher#88's gate widen from `IdType` to `StoredIdType`**, closing the
  `FetchLatest` phantom for strong-typed aggregates too. Verified by narrowing it back: the strong-typed
  phantom test fails.
- **`FisherDocumentComplianceFixture` replays `config.ValueTypes` before the mappings.** Fisher
  discovers wrappers by itself, so it is an assertion rather than a prerequisite — but a fixture that
  would break under a store needing it is not worth writing.

One thing this surfaced and did **not** change: the typed overloads still throw a raw
`InvalidCastException` for a mismatched identity — `LoadAsync<Order>("12")` against a `long`-keyed type
binds to `LoadAsync<T>(string)` and casts storage. Pre-existing, out of fisher#89's scope, and noted in
`an_identity_of_the_wrong_type_is_refused_by_name` so the next reader does not mistake it for this
member's behaviour.

**Fisher's own types *are* the contracts — there is no adapter, and that is the result rather than a
convenience.** The binding is four interface declarations and one partial class:

| Contract | Fisher |
|---|---|
| `IDocumentReadOperations` | `IQuerySession` |
| `IDocumentWriteOperations` | `IDocumentOperations` |
| `IDocumentSessionOperations` | `IDocumentSession` |
| `IDocumentSessionFactory<TOperations, TQuerySession>` | `IDocumentStore` |
| `IDocumentQueryExecutor` | `FisherQueryProvider` |

- **The three-tier split lands exactly where fisher#33 already drew it.** The contract separates
  enlisting from committing because a projection writes and must never commit; `IDocumentOperations`
  was split out of `IDocumentSession` for tenant scopes, which cannot commit either. Same line, two
  reasons, so the middle tier was accepted with no reshaping — and `ITenantOperations` becomes an
  `IDocumentWriteOperations` for free.
- **The one non-mechanical part was a constraint widening**, as it was on Polecat. The contract is
  `where T : notnull` and Fisher's by-identity document read surface — `LoadAsync`, `LoadManyAsync`,
  `CheckExistsAsync`, `LoadJsonAsync` — was `where T : class`, which is strictly narrower and so cannot
  implement it. Widening it *removed* an inconsistency rather than creating one: `Store`, `Delete`,
  `DeleteWhere` and `Query<T>` were already `notnull`, so only the read half disagreed.
- **`Query<T>()` binds implicitly, where both siblings need a default interface implementation to
  forward it.** Marten returns `IMartenQueryable<T>` and Polecat `IPolecatQueryable<T>`; C# has no
  return-type covariance for interface implementation, so each has to declare theirs `new` and forward.
  Fisher already returned a plain `IQueryable<T>`. The one place this binding is cheaper here.
- **`IDocumentQueryExecutor`'s `T` is unconstrained, so the four provider methods behind Fisher's
  terminals were widened to match.** Nothing downstream wanted the constraint — `ISelector<T>` is
  unconstrained and the projected path casts through `object?` — so `notnull` there was a claim being
  made rather than a requirement being met, and dropping it cascaded to nothing. Fisher's own public
  terminals keep it, where it is a useful signal to a caller. Each of the four **reads
  `queryable.Expression`**, never a captured one, because the shared extensions compose
  `Queryable.Where` onto the queryable before dispatching — that is how the predicate overloads come
  free, and reading a captured expression would silently drop the predicate.
- **`IDocumentSessionFactory` goes on `IDocumentStore` rather than being implemented explicitly**,
  which is the one shared contract that does, and the distinction from the tooling surfaces is the
  point: those describe a monitoring console's view of the store, this describes opening a session,
  which is already the store's own API. It is also what makes an **ancillary** store work with no
  second mechanism — `AddFisherStore<T>` constrains its marker to `IDocumentStore`, so the marker
  inherits the factory and the `DispatchProxy` implements it. Marten and Polecat both declare it in
  this position; had the three each picked their own, a store-agnostic consumer could not resolve an
  ancillary store portably, which is the failure mode fisher#68 names.
- **Neither of Fisher's factories is genuinely parameterless** — both take an optional tenant id — so
  all three factory members are forwarded by DIM on the interface rather than by three one-liners on
  `DocumentStore` and three more on `SecondaryStoreProxy`. The tenant argument defaults to null, which
  is the right reading of a contract with no tenant parameter: JasperFx left tenant-scoped opening out
  deliberately and can add it additively.
  - ⚠️ **It did, and the optional parameter is exactly why the additive pair needed four more
    forwarders** (jasperfx#898). `LightweightSession(string)` / `QuerySession(string)` arrived with
    throwing defaults, and `LightweightSession(string? tenantId = null)` satisfies **neither** member:
    not the parameterless one, because an optional parameter does not implement it, and not the string
    one, because the nullability differs and a hiding declaration on a derived interface never
    implements the base's member anyway. So the two declarations on `IDocumentStore` are now `new` —
    the hiding is deliberate, and a caller holding `IDocumentStore` should bind to Fisher's own
    member — and four explicit forwarders carry the contract. Same near-miss `IDocumentReadOperations.Events`
    and `IDocumentSessionOperations.PendingStreams` already carry, and the same reason it is written
    down: **delete the forwarders and Fisher still compiles, is still perfectly correct about tenancy,
    and every fact in `DocumentConjoinedTenancyCompliance` fails with `NotSupportedException`** — on
    the one route the shared contract exists for, which is the route least likely to be exercised by a
    Fisher-local test.
- **No DI registration was needed or added**, matching both siblings. `IDocumentStore` is already
  registered and *is* the factory.

Four compliance suites, 45 tests, enrolled in `fisher_event_store_compliance.cs` and green on the
first run. `FisherDocumentComplianceFixture` is three members wide and **deliberately not generic over
Fisher's session pair**, unlike the event fixture: everything the document suites do runs through the
shared contracts, so `Sessions` is typed as the bare `IDocumentSessionFactory` and a suite reaching
past it would not compile. Two Fisher-specific notes:

- **Document types are registered up front, and on SQLite that is required rather than tidy.** Fisher
  creates a document table at first write and SQLite resolves a table name when it *prepares* a
  statement, so `query_over_an_empty_document_type_returns_an_empty_list` and the `AnyAsync` over an
  untouched type would fail with `no such table` rather than answering empty.
  `DocumentComplianceConfig.DocumentTypes` exists for exactly this. Same lesson rebuild teardown,
  `CleanAsync<T>` and the document diagnostics each had to learn.
- **Fisher needs no shared xUnit collection, where Marten and Polecat both do.** All four suites pin
  `SchemaName` to `compliance_documents` and the base suite wipes document data before every test, so
  against one server one class's wipe lands in the middle of another's test. A throwaway SQLite file
  per fixture instance — one per test — leaves the wipe nothing else to reach.

**Half two of fisher#68 is `Wolverine.Fisher` and is not actionable from this repository**, the same
place Polecat's issue landed: the integration is built in the wolverine repo against wolverine#3907.
Two SQLite constraints carry into its design and are worth restating there — Wolverine's durability
tables must commit through `ITransactionParticipant` on Fisher's own connection rather than through a
parallel connection to the same file (a second connection presents as a *hang*, not an error), and
leader election across a cluster is not viable on one file, so hosting is solo/embedded.

### Transaction participants

`ITransactionParticipant` and `IDocumentSession.AddTransactionParticipant` (fisher#50, half one) —
something else writing on Fisher's connection, inside Fisher's transaction, committed with it.

**More important on SQLite than on either sibling, and structurally so.** One writer per database
file. An application using Fisher for its events and something else — EF Core, Dapper, hand-written
ADO.NET — for its relational tables, in the same file, which is the natural thing to do with an
embedded database, cannot write both atomically without this. Worse, it cannot write both *at all*
without contending against itself: the two transactions are two writers on one file, and one waits or
fails with `SQLITE_BUSY`. On PostgreSQL the equivalent is a nicety.

**`Fisher.ITransactionParticipant` is a one-line alias now**, deriving from
`Weasel.Storage.ITransactionParticipant<SqliteConnection, SqliteTransaction>` (weasel#561) and
declaring no members of its own. **Adopting it is a simplification rather than a loss, and the reason
is that the shared contract is Fisher's**: `AfterCommitAsync`'s default — the "reconcile whatever
`BeforeCommitAsync` left pending, now that it is durable" half that the two-attempt retry rule creates
— was Fisher's member, and the lift took it upstream as the contract for all three stores. So the
retry rule and its answer are documented once, in Weasel, and Fisher's file carries only the two facts
the shared remarks cannot: `BeforeCommitAsync` occupies the position fisher#4 pinned, and
`AfterCommitAsync` does not fire at all for an enlisted session.

What contravariance does and does not give is worth stating, because the shared interface is
contravariant in both parameters and that reads like more than it is. A participant written against
the base `DbConnection`/`DbTransaction` pair *converts to* the closed shape; it still has to **declare**
`Fisher.ITransactionParticipant` to be handed to `AddTransactionParticipant`. Porting a participant
between the three stores is therefore a change to its base declaration and nothing else, which is what
the shared contract's own remarks promise.

- **The inverse of enlistment, and both are worth having.** `SessionOptions.ForTransaction` lets a
  caller hand Fisher a transaction they own; this lets a participant join one Fisher owns. Which fits
  depends on the participant — a component whose "save" is a method call rather than a connection to
  borrow (`DbContext.SaveChangesAsync`) is far easier this way round.
- **A participant must write on the connection it is handed, not merely to the same file.** Two
  connections to one file are two writers, and the second blocks on the first *from inside the first's
  transaction* — a genuine self-deadlock that presents as a hang rather than an error. That is the
  single most likely way to build one wrong, and it is why the connection is a parameter rather than
  something the participant is expected to find.
- **The hook is the last thing inside the transaction**, the position `IMessageBatch.BeforeCommitAsync`
  already occupies — so its visibility semantics are the ones fisher#4 pinned, and
  `a_participants_write_is_invisible_until_the_commit` re-probes them over a separate connection.
- **Both commit paths invoke participants**, `FisherSession.SaveChangesAsync` and
  `FisherProjectionBatch.ExecuteAsync` alike, so a projection or subscription that enlists one does not
  have to know which it is running under. The batch gathers them *before* the resilience pipeline for
  fisher#12's reason — everything the delegate consumes has to survive being read twice.
- **`BeforeCommitAsync` can be called more than once for one unit of work, and that was a real silent
  bug.** A retried `SQLITE_BUSY` re-executes the whole write delegate. EF Core's `SaveChangesAsync`
  accepts its changes when *its own command* succeeds, not when Fisher commits — probed directly: an
  entity goes `Added` → `Unchanged` at the save and stays `Unchanged` through a rollback of the
  enclosing transaction. So attempt two found a `DbContext` that believed it had already saved, wrote
  nothing, and let Fisher commit without EF's rows, invisibly, because Fisher's own work committed
  either way. The factory form was safe by construction (a retry runs the factory again, so the
  caller's lambda rebuilds and re-adds); only an already-built context was exposed, and it now saves
  with `acceptAllChangesOnSuccess: false`.
- **`AfterCommitAsync` is the other half of that, and it is *not* a post-commit side-effect hook.**
  `IDocumentSessionListener` (fisher#32) is still the seam for those. This one exists for the narrower
  job the retry rule creates: a participant holding its writes replayable across attempts needs one
  place to stop, and only Fisher knows when the commit happened. Default-implemented, so a participant
  that does not need it declares one member as before. Runs outside the resilience pipeline in both
  paths, and **not at all for an enlisted session** — where the commit is the caller's and there is no
  retry either, so there is nothing to reconcile until they commit.
- A participant added through a tenant scope lands on the parent, for the same reason its boundaries
  and metadata do: there is one transaction.

### Runtime tenants

`Storage/ITenantSource.cs` and `DynamicTenancy` (fisher#58) — `MultiTenantedDatabasesInDirectory(...)`
or `MultiTenantedDatabasesFrom(source)`, so the set of tenants is *asked for* rather than declared.
`SeparateDatabaseTenancy` (fisher#47) stays for a fixed set; the two are alternatives.

**Viable here in a way it is not on either sibling.** Provisioning a tenant is a file plus a
migration, cheap enough to do on first use — which is what makes "a tenant appears without a restart"
a reasonable offer rather than an operational event. On PostgreSQL or SQL Server the same act is a
`CREATE DATABASE`, which is why Marten's and Polecat's equivalents lean on a master table an operator
populates deliberately.

- **The first-use migration hangs off `OpenConnectionAsync`, not off tenant resolution, and that is
  forced.** `ITenancy.DatabaseFor` is reached from `OpenSession`, which is synchronous and has no
  `await` to offer; a migration is asynchronous. Opening a connection is the first genuinely
  asynchronous thing that happens to a new tenant's file, and it happens before any statement can run
  against it. Blocking inside `DatabaseFor` would have been sync-over-async on the session path.
  Re-entrancy is guarded with a `[ThreadStatic]`, because the migration opens connections of its own;
  the semaphore beside it is for two callers racing, which is a different question. **The result is
  not cached until it succeeds** — a transient failure remembered as done would leave the tenant
  permanently unusable with nothing to say why.
- **`ITenantSource.TryFind` is synchronous and `AllAsync` is not**, for the same reason. The hot path
  has to answer without I/O, which the directory convention manages trivially (a tenant id maps to a
  path); enumerating every tenant is a startup and daemon concern where an `await` is available.
- **`DirectoryTenantSource` resolves *any* tenant id**, whether its file exists yet or not, which is
  what makes a new tenant work with no registration step. Enumeration reports only the files that are
  there. `InMemoryTenantSource` is the opposite — it refuses what it was not told about, which is the
  difference an application pushing its own tenants table wants.
  - ⚠️ **That is also why the id has to be validated as a FILE NAME, and it was not** (fisher#318).
    "Any id resolves" plus `Path.Combine` not constraining its result to the first argument meant a
    tenant id that was not a plain identifier resolved *outside* the configured directory — and
    `LightweightSession(tenantId)` would **create a SQLite database there**, at whatever the process
    can write. The reachable shape is not exotic: Wolverine and ASP.NET tenant-id detection commonly
    forward a header, a route value or a subdomain straight into `ForTenant(...)`.
  - **Fisher's to refuse rather than the application's to sanitise**, because Fisher is the layer that
    turns the string into a path. `InMemoryTenantSource.Add` already validated its input, so the
    sources disagreed about whether anything was checked at all.
  - **Refused, never sanitised**, and that is the load-bearing half: stripping the unsafe characters
    maps two tenant ids onto one database file, which is the exact failure database-per-tenant exists
    to make impossible, and it would be silent. `TenantFileName` is a positive charset
    (`A-Z a-z 0-9 . _ -`) plus a resolved-path containment check as belt and braces — an allowlist
    cannot be widened by a platform Fisher was not tested on, where a denylist has to anticipate every
    separator and every reserved name.
  - **`.` is allowed and three cases around it are not**, which is why they are named separately:
    `acme.co` is an ordinary id, `..` traverses, a leading `.` hides the file on every Unix-like
    system, and Windows *silently strips* a trailing one — so `acme.` and `acme` would be one file
    there and two everywhere else.
  - ⚠️ **`*DEFAULT*` is exempted by exact identity**, because `DynamicTenancy.Default` resolves it
    while the store is still being **constructed** — refusing it would make every directory-tenancy
    store fail to build. By identity rather than by admitting `*` to the charset, since `*` in a
    caller's id is precisely what this refuses.
  - ⚠️ **Its FILE is `(default).db`, not `*DEFAULT*.db`** (fisher#325). The sentinel taken literally
    put a `*` in the file name, and that was **measured** rather than assumed to break Windows: on a
    `windows-latest` runner the file cannot be opened (`SQLite Error 14: unable to open database
    file`), so `ApplyAllConfiguredChangesToDatabaseAsync` failed and directory tenancy did not work
    there at all. Fisher's main CI is Linux-only, which is why nothing noticed.
    - **Parentheses because the charset refuses them**, so no caller's id can ever name the file — the
      property the old name had too. `_default` would be a valid tenant id, and two tenants would share
      a database.
    - **An existing `*DEFAULT*.db` keeps being used** (`TenantFileName.FileStemFor`), which is what made
      the rename safe to do at all: it could only exist where `*` is legal, so off Windows an existing
      store keeps its data and on Windows there was never one to orphan. Enumeration maps both stems
      back to `*DEFAULT*` and dedupes.
    - **`.github/workflows/windows.yml`** runs the directory-tenancy classes on Windows, path-filtered to
      the tenancy files rather than a leg of `fisher.yml`, because the org's concurrent-job ceiling is
      shared across every JasperFx repository.
  - **The configuration path refuses the same ids**, through `TenantDatabases.InDirectory`. A store
    that accepted an id in configuration and refused it at runtime would be inconsistent about its own
    rule, and the failure would land at whichever call site came second.
- **A source has to answer for the default tenant**, read while the store is being built rather than
  lazily, so a source that cannot says so at construction instead of at the first store-level
  operation. There is no store-level file under this tenancy for it to fall back on.
- **Suspension, never deletion**, and this is the decision fisher#58 asked to be made rather than
  defaulted. Deleting a tenant here means deleting a file — the cheapest deprovisioning of any Critter
  Stack store, and the most irreversible — and Fisher cannot know whether that file is backed up. So
  the API suspends or forgets and an operator removes the file themselves.
  **`DisabledTenantException` is distinct from `UnknownTenantException`** because "switched off" and
  "never heard of it" are different operational situations and an application handling one should not
  have to guess which it got.
  - **It subclasses the lifted `JasperFx.MultiTenancy.DisabledTenantException`** (jasperfx#875 /
    fisher#321), and — as with fisher#307's archiving exception — the lift took *Fisher's* type as its
    canonical shape. Marten's and Polecat's master-table tenancies both report a disabled row as
    `UnknownTenantIdException`, so the operator who just disabled a tenant reads "Unknown tenant id"
    about one that is still there and was turned off on purpose.
  - **Deriving widened what catches it, and that is the upstream intent rather than a loss.** The
    shared type derives from `UnknownTenantIdException`, so a `catch (UnknownTenantIdException)` now
    reaches a disabled tenant — it still refuses the session, it just names the reason. The
    distinction above is untouched: Fisher's `UnknownTenantException` is a different class, so
    nothing that told the two apart stops being able to.
  - **Fisher's own wording survives**, through the protected message-overriding constructor. It names
    the tenant's *database file* and says it is untouched, which is what an operator wants to know
    about a store whose tenants are files and which never deletes one.
  - ⚠️ **The name still collides** — a file importing both `Fisher.Storage` and
    `JasperFx.MultiTenancy` gets CS0104 and has to qualify. Subclassing does not fix that and could
    not. It stays in `Fisher.Storage` beside `UnknownTenantException` rather than moving to
    `Fisher.Exceptions`: the two answer the same question, and moving either is a breaking change to
    a `using` for no behavioural gain.
- **The daemon polls for new tenants**, at `FisherDaemonHostedService.TenantPollingInterval` (one
  minute), and only under `DynamicMultiple`. Polling rather than notification because the set of
  tenants belongs to the application and Fisher is never pushed to. A new tenant's *sessions* work
  immediately either way — resolution does not go through the hosted service. Daemons are keyed by
  database identifier, since a second daemon over one file is two writers contending for one write
  lock.
- **Databases are cached and never evicted, and the measurement says that is right** (fisher#59). A
  tenant resolved but never used costs no measurable memory and no file handles at all, so there is
  nothing for eviction to reclaim. What costs is a tenant that has been *used* — see "Releasing pooled
  connections" below. `ForgetTenantAsync` is the explicit release for a tenant a process is finished
  with.

#### The tenant registry — fisher#213

`Storage/MasterTableTenantSource.cs` and `Storage/SqliteMasterTenantTableDialect.cs`, reached by
`StoreOptions.MultiTenantedDatabasesInRegistry(...)`. Marten's **master-table** tenancy: tenant →
connection string in a control table, with tenants added, suspended, resumed and removed at runtime.
For a store whose tenants are files, the analogue of the master table is a **tenant-registry
database** — one small SQLite file holding `fi_tenants`.

**The fourth source, and the first where the tenant set is a *record*.** The other three each fail to
be one for a different reason: `DirectoryTenantSource` resolves any tenant id at all — the point of
it, and also why it can never say "that is not one of ours"; `InMemoryTenantSource` holds the set in
one process's memory, so nothing survives a restart and two nodes disagree; a fixed
`MultiTenantedDatabases` set is configuration.

**Weasel's lifted `MasterTableTenancyBase` is adopted rather than reimplemented** (weasel#567, Weasel
9.31.0). The control-table contract, the cache, provisioning-once, the seed list and the whole
`IDynamicTenantSource<string>` lifecycle are its; Fisher supplies `IMasterTenantTableDialect` and one
adapter. `SqliteDataSource` *is* a `DbDataSource`, so the lift's seam fits with nothing adapted, and
Fisher gets the store-agnostic admin surface (`IDynamicTenantSource<string>`,
`IMasterTableMultiTenancy`) for free — a surface it had no equivalent of.

- ⚠️ **The base is closed over `TenantRegistration`, not over `FisherDatabase`, and that is the whole
  design.** The base's own remarks say everything it does with a `TDatabase` is cache it, hand it back
  and dispose it — so closing it over the *registration* makes its cache Fisher's synchronous snapshot
  of the control table, which is exactly what `ITenantSource.TryFind` needs. Closing it over
  `FisherDatabase` would have put a second database cache beside `DynamicTenancy`'s — two
  `SqliteDataSource`s and two connection pools per tenant — and forced `DatabaseFor` to resolve
  asynchronously. Going through `ITenantSource` instead is also what reuses `DynamicTenancy` whole:
  the first-use migration, the daemon's tenant poller, `ForgetTenantAsync`, the cleaner, the CLI
  database source and `DisabledTenantException` all work with nothing added.
- ⚠️ **Marten's `GetTenant(string)` is `tryFindTenantDatabase(...).GetAwaiter().GetResult()`, and that
  is the one thing not to copy.** `DatabaseFor` is reached from `OpenSession`, which has no `await` to
  offer — the reason `TryFind` is synchronous and `AllAsync` is not. So the trade is stated rather
  than hidden: **a tenant this process has not read does not resolve.** One added through
  `AddTenantAsync` here is cached as it is written; one added by another process appears on the next
  refresh (the daemon polls every minute, and every `RefreshAsync` caller refreshes on demand).
- ⚠️ **The seed list is what makes a default tenant possible at all.** `DynamicTenancy.Default` is read
  while the store is being *built*, before anything could have read the control table — so a registry
  naming its tenants only in the table cannot answer for `*DEFAULT*` and the store refuses to
  construct. `TryFind` therefore falls back to `SeedDatabases`, which is configuration rather than
  data: known synchronously, and upserted into the table on the first refresh so the two agree. The
  fallback is checked *after* the disabled set, so suspending a seeded tenant still suspends it.
- **`tenant_id` is declared `collate nocase`.** The base compares cache keys with the comparer it is
  handed and Fisher hands it `OrdinalIgnoreCase`, matching its other two tenancies; SQLite's default
  collation is case-sensitive, so without the collation the cache and the table disagree about whether
  `Acme` and `acme` are one tenant — a tenant that resolves through one and not the other, which reads
  as an intermittent.
- **The upsert does not clear the disabled flag.** The dialect contract explicitly leaves this to the
  dialect and says the two shipped stores disagree — Polecat's `MERGE` re-enables, Marten's
  `on conflict` does not. Fisher follows Marten: resuming a suspended tenant as a side effect of
  correcting its connection string would silently undo a deliberate suspension.
- **Control-plane reads and writes go through `StoreOptions.ResiliencePipeline`**, via the base's
  `ExecuteAsync` hook. The registry is a SQLite file and takes one writer, so an operator adding a
  tenant while a node reads the table is exactly the `SQLITE_BUSY` the pipeline exists for. Polecat
  overrides the same hook; Marten leaves it on the default.
- **The table name folds the logical schema in**, like every other Fisher table, so two logical stores
  sharing one registry file keep separate tenant lists.

**The deletion stance held with no guard, which is the useful finding.** Fisher deprovisions and never
deletes — deleting a tenant here means deleting a *file*, and Fisher cannot know it is backed up — and
the lifted base already draws the line in the same place: its `DeleteDatabaseRecordAsync` says the
tenant's own database is left completely alone. So `SuspendTenantAsync` flips a flag,
`ForgetTenantAsync` deletes the *row*, and neither touches the `.db`. There is deliberately no member
on the source that removes one, and `the_source_offers_no_way_to_delete_a_tenants_database` pins that
by reflection rather than by prose, because "we do not delete" is exactly the rule a later convenience
method breaks without anybody noticing.

**`ITenantSource.OnTenantRevoked` closes a gap the registry made sharp** — and it applies to all three
sources. `DynamicTenancy` caches a `FisherDatabase` per tenant and `DatabaseFor` answers from that
cache, so **suspending a tenant the store had already resolved used to do nothing**; the old
`runtime_tenants` test said so in a comment and opened a *fresh store* to observe the refusal. That is
tolerable for a directory convention an operator edits by hand and wrong for a control table, whose
whole point is runtime effect. The tenancy now sets a revocation callback the source raises, and the
cached database is evicted and disposed.

- **A callback rather than a check on the resolution path**, because `TryFind` is on the session-open
  hot path and `DirectoryTenantSource` builds a `SqliteConnectionStringBuilder` on every call —
  consulting it per session would be a real per-session cost to make a rare event immediate.
- **Default-implemented on the interface** (`get => null; set { }`), so it is additive: `ITenantSource`
  is public and implementable outside this repo, and a source that never revokes needs no change.
- Disposal is synchronous, because a source revokes from a synchronous method. The difference from
  `ForgetTenantAsync`'s async path is only that a pooled connection's close is not awaited, and
  clearing the pool leaves a checked-out connection working either way (fisher#59).

### Releasing pooled connections

`FisherDatabase.ReleasePooledConnections` and `DynamicTenancy.ForgetTenantAsync` (fisher#59).

**The issue was filed about caching `FisherDatabase` objects, and measuring said that was the wrong
thing to worry about.** 200 tenant databases resolved but never used cost no measurable memory and
opened no files — a `SqliteDataSource` is a *factory*, not a pool, building a fresh `SqliteConnection`
on every open. What costs is a tenant that has been **used**: Microsoft.Data.Sqlite keeps a pooled
connection per connection string, worth three file handles (`.db`, `-wal`, `-shm`), in a
**process-wide** registry that nothing Fisher disposed ever touched. 50 used tenants held 3.4 handles
apiece and still held them after the store was disposed.

So the fix is not eviction, and **it was leaking for every store rather than only a multi-tenant
one**: disposing a Fisher store left its pooled connections behind.

- **This is `SqliteConnection.ClearPool(connection)`, not `ClearAllPools()`, and the distinction is
  the whole reason it is safe.** The banned one disposes every pooled connection in the process, so
  one store's cleanup takes out another's — which is why the conventions forbid it and why
  `TemporaryDatabase.Dispose` already uses the targeted form. This one names a connection string and
  touches only that pool.
- **A connection currently checked out is unharmed.** Verified against Microsoft.Data.Sqlite 10.0.9:
  it goes on reading and writing after its pool is cleared, and is discarded rather than re-pooled
  when it closes. That is what makes forgetting a tenant safe while a session is mid-request, and it
  is the property whose absence would have made this an `ObjectDisposedException` generator.
- **Eviction on idleness is deliberately absent.** A timer cannot tell a tenant that is finished from
  one that is merely quiet, re-resolving one is nearly free, and the thing it would reclaim costs
  nothing until the tenant is used. `ForgetTenantAsync` leaves the judgement with the caller who
  actually knows. Nothing breaks if it is never called.
- **Two stores over one file share the pool**, so disposing one releases the other's *idle*
  connections. Harmless — they reopen on demand — and pinned, because it is the bounded version of the
  thing `ClearAllPools` is forbidden for.
- **Tested through SQLite's own `-wal` and `-shm` sidecars rather than by counting file descriptors.**
  SQLite deletes them when the last connection closes, so their presence is an exact, *file-local*
  statement about whether anything still holds the database open. A `/dev/fd` count answers the same
  question process-wide, which under xUnit's parallel collections is the intermittent tracing already
  learned to avoid.

### Database-per-tenant (stage 1)

`Storage/ITenancy.cs` (fisher#47) — `DefaultTenancy`, `SeparateDatabaseTenancy`, and
`StoreOptions.MultiTenantedDatabases(...)`. **Conjoined tenancy stays and stays the default**; the two
are alternatives, as on both siblings.

**Arguably SQLite's best tenancy story rather than its worst.** The usual objection —
database-per-tenant is heavyweight to provision — inverts here: a tenant is a *file*. Creating one is
a file plus a migration, deleting one is deleting a file, backing one up is copying it, and one
tenant's data cannot leak into another's because there is no shared table to leak through. And it
answers the sharpest structural constraint: under conjoined tenancy every tenant contends for one
write lock, where under file-per-tenant they write concurrently. That makes it a **performance**
feature as much as an isolation one, which is not true on either sibling —
`two_tenants_write_at_the_same_time` pins it by holding one tenant's write lock across the other's
whole commit.

- **The session path is the whole of what changed.** `OpenSession` resolves its database from
  `Tenancy.DatabaseFor(options.TenantId)`; under `DefaultTenancy` every tenant resolves the one
  database, so nothing moves for a store that did not ask for this. `FisherDatabase` already had an
  internal constructor taking a connection string, which is the seam this needed.
- **An unknown tenant throws rather than falling back to the default.** Falling back would write one
  tenant's data into another's file — the one failure this tenancy exists to make impossible, and it
  would be silent.
- **Migration is per database with per-database status.** `ApplyAllConfiguredChangesToDatabaseAsync`
  over a hundred tenants that fails at the fortieth leaves mixed versions whatever it throws;
  `TenantMigrationException` reports *which* are current. Run sequentially, not in parallel: each
  migration takes its own file's write lock, so parallelism wins nothing on the DDL and holds N
  connections against a pool ceiling that sizes one file.
- **Both file-naming shapes, with the convention as the default.** `InDirectory(...)` + `AddTenants(...)`
  is what makes a hundred tenants one line and is what stage 3 will need, since a tenant that appears
  at runtime has no configuration line to carry a path; `AddTenant(id, connectionString)` is the
  flexible form.
- **`ATTACH` stays out of it.** It would let one connection see several tenants, but an attachment has
  per-connection lifecycle to re-establish on every pooled checkout — exactly what `FisherTableNaming`
  exists to avoid.
- **WAL, busy timeout and foreign keys are per file for free**, because `SqliteDataSource` applies the
  PRAGMAs per connection. The cost is that `MaxPoolSize` sizes *each tenant's* pool.
- **The daemon runs one instance per tenant database** (fisher#57). `BuildProjectionDaemonAsync(tenantId)`
  builds one; `BuildProjectionDaemonsAsync()` builds them all, and is what `AddAsyncDaemon` hosts —
  the single-daemon overload with no argument projects the default file and says nothing about the
  others. **N daemons over N files do not contend**, which is the same property that makes this
  tenancy a performance feature; under conjoined tenancy the same N projections queue behind one write
  lock. Runtime tenants are **fisher#58**.
- **Shard names did not have to become (projection, tenant)**, which fisher#57 expected they would.
  `fi_event_progression` lives in each tenant's own file, so every database already has its own
  high-water mark and its own progress row per shard — two tenants running one projection are two
  daemons writing the same shard name to two different tables. A second key would have drawn a
  distinction the file boundary already draws.
- ⚠️ **Sharded tenancy — several tenants co-located in one file — works, and `SeparateDatabaseTenancy`
  builds one `FisherDatabase` per FILE rather than per tenant to make it work** (fisher#252). Two
  tenants naming one connection string under `TenancyStyle.Conjoined` is a configuration fisher#47
  never contemplated, because its whole framing is "a tenant is a file". Keying on the tenant fixed
  three things at once when it was changed to key on the file: `AllDatabases()` reported a shared file
  once per tenant, so the explorer's fan-out read it that many times; each instance held its own
  `SqliteDataSource`, so N pools sat over one file; and each claimed the file belonged to *its* tenant.
  The visible result was **every stream reported once per co-located tenant, each copy attributed to
  the wrong one**.
  - **`FisherDatabase.TenantId` is null for a shared file**, which is the honest answer rather than a
    gap — a file holding two tenants' data cannot say whose it is.
  - **The explorer needed no change at all.** `GetRecentStreamsAsync`'s `database.TenantId is null`
    branch — keep the row's own `tenant_id` rather than stamping the file's tenant — was correct all
    along and was simply unreachable, because nothing ever built a database with a null tenant.
  - ⚠️ **Two tenants sharing a file *without* conjoined tenancy is silently the same data, and is
    refused** — `SharedFileTenancyGuard` (fisher#257). A shared file requires conjoined event tenancy
    **and** `MultiTenanted()` on every document type; the trap is silent in the fisher#51 direction,
    where the tenant owning most of the data sees a correct-looking answer with extras. Same rule as
    fisher#46's refusal of two stores over one file with one schema name, a layer down.
    - ⚠️ **Conjoined event tenancy is required even for a store that never appends an event**, and
      that is a decision. The conditional rule cannot be decided honestly: the event tables are
      created by every migration whether anything writes to them or not, and an append does not need
      its event type registered — so "does this store use events" has no reliable answer at
      configuration time, and a rule that guessed would refuse some safe stores and admit some unsafe
      ones. `a_documents_only_store_still_has_to_say_conjoined` pins it as a decision rather than
      leaving it to read as over-reach.
    - **Two checkpoints, because one cannot be complete.** `DocumentStore`'s constructor covers
      everything registered at configuration time — beside `AssertEveryMappingHasIdentity`, and for
      its reason: that is the first moment the configuration is final. A document mapping created
      lazily is invisible there, so the guard runs again where such a type's table is provisioned, on
      both the write and the read path (fisher#74's two entry points). Removing either checkpoint
      fails tests — two for the second, three for the first.
    - ⚠️ **The check cannot live in `DocumentSchema.MappingFor`**, which is the placement that
      suggests itself. `Schema.For<T>().MultiTenanted()` creates the mapping and *then* sets the flag,
      so a refusal at creation fires before the line that satisfies it could run — the trap fisher#218
      moved `AssertEveryMappingHasIdentity` out of `DocumentMapping`'s constructor for.
    - **`ITenancy.SharedFiles()` is a default interface method returning empty**, because `ITenancy`
      is public and implementable outside this repo — an abstract member would be a breaking change,
      the reason fisher#172 adapted onto `IDatabaseSource` rather than widening it. The empty default
      is also the safe one: a tenancy Fisher does not know about is read as sharing nothing, so the
      guard refuses nothing it cannot see.
  - **Neither compliance arm reaches it**, which is why `sharded_tenancy_reads` exists:
    `ShardedTenancyExplorerCompliance` never asks for a *store-global* listing, and
    `DatabasePerTenantExplorerCompliance` has no co-located tenants for a file to misattribute. Five of
    its six tests fail against the old behaviour; the sixth is the tenant-scoped read, which was
    already right and is the regression guard.
- **Cleaning spans every database.** `ResetAllDataAsync` and the whole `IDocumentCleaner` surface loop
  `Tenancy.AllDatabases()`; cleaning only the default would leave every other tenant's data behind
  while reporting success, and the caller most likely to hit that is a test fixture.
- `StoreOptions.ConnectionString` becomes optional under this tenancy, because there is no store-level
  file — a store-level connection string would be a database nothing writes to.

### Multi-store registration

`AddFisherStore<T>(...)`, `IConfigureFisher` and `FisherStoreRegistry` (fisher#46).

**Several stores are a *better* fit here than on either sibling.** On PostgreSQL or SQL Server a second
store usually means a second schema in one database and the isolation is the server's. On SQLite a
second store can simply be a second **file** — separately backed up, separately deletable, and with its
own write lock. That last point is the one that matters: one writer per file is SQLite's central
constraint, so splitting a workload across two files is the primary way to get two concurrent writers,
and this is the ergonomic front door to it. Both shapes already worked at the storage layer; only the
registration surface was missing.

- **The marker proxy is `System.Reflection.DispatchProxy`** — in the BCL, so no proxy library and no
  code generation. A marker interface is empty apart from what it inherits, so every call it can
  receive is one the wrapped store already implements. `TargetInvocationException` is unwrapped with
  `ExceptionDispatchInfo`, or every exception from a secondary store arrives wrapped and the proxy
  leaks into the application's catch blocks. **The proxy class cannot be `sealed`** — `DispatchProxy`
  derives from it at runtime and says so.
- **A proxy is not an `IEventStore`.** `DispatchProxy` implements the interfaces it was asked for and no
  others, and the tooling surfaces are implemented explicitly and deliberately absent from
  `IDocumentStore` (fisher#45) — so the `IEventStore` registration reaches *through* the proxy to the
  real store, or a secondary store is invisible to a monitoring console.
- **A secondary store's sessions are reached through the store, not injected.** `IDocumentSession`
  cannot be registered scoped for two stores at once; Polecat answers this the same way, and keyed
  registrations would give Fisher a shape neither sibling has for a case a property access reads
  perfectly well. Pinned, so it is a convention rather than an accident.
- **Two stores registered over one file with the same `DatabaseSchemaName` are refused.** They would
  share every table — each reading, writing and cleaning the other's rows — and it is silent. The
  registry is **scoped to the container, not the process**, deliberately: building two `DocumentStore`s
  over one file by hand is something tests and migrations legitimately do, and
  `applying_the_configuration_again_is_a_no_op` is exactly that. What is refused is *registering* two.
- **`IConfigureFisher<T>` exists because which store a contribution is about has to be sayable.** An
  untargeted contribution reaches the primary store only; without the distinction, a library's
  configuration would reach stores it has never heard of.
- **`ConfigureFisher(...)` is the lambda form, and it is what makes the three stores' integration code
  read alike** (fisher#70, over JasperFx/wolverine#3907). Four overloads mirroring
  `PolecatStoreServiceCollectionExtensions`: a primary and a targeted pair, each with and without the
  container. Wolverine's ancillary integration uses exactly this to layer its own `StoreOptions`
  contributions onto a store somebody else registered.
- **Both registration styles are swept, and the second silently did nothing.** Fisher resolves
  `IConfigureFisher` and filters by the contribution's own interfaces; Marten and Polecat resolve the
  closed `IConfigure*<T>` directly, so code ported from either registers against `IConfigureFisher<T>`
  — which `GetServices<IConfigureFisher>()` does not return, because the container matches on the
  service type a registration *named* rather than on what it implements. A contribution that compiles,
  registers and never runs. `Configured` now sweeps both and deduplicates **by reference**, which is
  what lets `ConfigureFisher<T>` register its lambda against both service types and still configure
  once. `a_contribution_registered_against_the_closed_interface_is_applied` and
  `a_targeted_lambda_configures_once` pin the two halves, each verified by reverting it.
- `StoreName` defaults to the marker's name, so two stores are distinguishable in a monitoring tool and
  in a trace with nothing said.

### Tracing

`Internal/FisherTracing.cs` (fisher#48) — an `ActivitySource` named `Fisher`, spans around
`SaveChangesAsync`, a LINQ execution and a document load, and a retry event on the enclosing span.

**The instinct is that tracing is for network calls and an embedded store has none. That is backwards
for what operators actually hit.** SQLite serialises writers per file, so the interesting question
about a slow Fisher call is almost always how long it waited for the write lock — and a request that
spent its time queued behind another writer is otherwise indistinguishable from one that was simply
slow.

- **Instrumented inside `FisherSession`, not through a decorator.** Polecat's
  `TracingSessionDecorator` means re-implementing every member of `IDocumentSession` as a pass-through
  — a cost that grows with every feature added to the interface, and one that interacts badly with the
  daemon queueing onto the concrete session type.
- **The retry event is the point, and it lives in the resilience pipeline's `OnRetry`.** Recorded
  against `Activity.Current` rather than a captured span, because the pipeline is shared by every path
  that executes SQL — a session's commit, the daemon's batch, the Hi-Lo advance. It is an *event* on
  the enclosing span rather than a span of its own: a retry is the same operation happening again.
- **A query's span covers building and executing the statement, not materializing the rows.** Every
  terminal reads rows after `ExecuteReaderAsync` returns, so covering materialization would mean a
  span per terminal — five copies of three lines, one of which would eventually be forgotten — and the
  question the span exists to answer is entirely inside the boundary drawn.
- **A failed commit marks its span `Error`.** Otherwise a trace shows a commit that never happened as
  a successful one, and the retry events under it read as noise rather than as the story.
- `SaveChangesAsync`'s counts are tagged *after* everything that can add to the unit of work has run —
  listeners, inline projections — so they describe what was written rather than what had been asked
  for when the span opened.

Two things learned while writing the tests, both worth keeping:

- **A contended write does not reach the retry the way you would expect.** The wait at
  `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` comes from the connection string's `Default Timeout` and from nowhere else — not
  `SessionOptions.Timeout`, which bounds a command, and not `PRAGMA busy_timeout`, which does not cover
  it. And `Default Timeout=0` means *no limit*, not "do not wait". So a contended save either sits for
  the full wait and succeeds with no retry, or fails while the connection is still being opened, since
  opening one applies the PRAGMAs and `journal_mode` wants the write lock. `a_busy_retry_is_recorded_on_the_span_it_contended`
  therefore drives the store's own pipeline with a planted `SQLITE_BUSY` and says so.
- **An `ActivityListener` is process-wide, and xUnit runs collections in parallel.** A test that
  asserts `Single(...)` over recorded spans is green alone and red in the full suite. Filter by a tag
  the test's own store sets.

### Metrics

`Services/OpenTelemetryOptions.cs` (fisher#208) — a `Meter` named `Fisher`, matching the
`ActivitySource`, reached through `StoreOptions.OpenTelemetry`. Derives from the lifted
`JasperFx.OpenTelemetry.OpenTelemetryOptions` so the `Meter` and the shape are the Critter Stack's
rather than a second copy. **Everything is opt-in and no instrument exists until a `Track…` call
creates it**, so a store that opts into nothing pays a null field read per commit.

- ⚠️ **A `SQLITE_BUSY` retry counter alone is the wrong instrument, and that is a measurement rather
  than an opinion.** It is the obvious one — the Polly pipeline already emits a `fisher.retry`
  activity event and `Fisher.Benchmarks`' `RetryCounter` counts them — and under fisher#163's
  concurrent-writers scenario it reads **zero** while throughput collapses, because a contended writer
  sits inside `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` under the connection string's busy timeout and eventually succeeds. A
  dashboard built on it shows a flat line through the exact incident it exists to diagnose, which is
  worse than no instrument: a flat line reads as "not the database".
  So the instrument is **`fisher.write_lock.wait`**, a histogram of the elapsed time inside
  `BeginTransactionAsync` at all three `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` sites — the session commit, the daemon batch
  and the rebuild teardown — tagged `fisher.write_lock.holder`. `fisher.write_lock.retries` is created
  *beside* it by the same `TrackWriteLockContention()` call, never instead of it, so neither can be
  charted without the other: a rising histogram with no retries is contention absorbed by the busy
  timeout, and a retry means the timeout was exceeded or the failure was `SQLITE_BUSY_SNAPSHOT`, which
  the timeout does not cover.
  `a_contended_commit_is_visible_in_the_wait_and_invisible_in_the_retries` asserts both halves against
  a real 400 ms lock hold, and it measures the hold rather than a threshold — it passes at 380 ms.
- **The holder tag is what separates "the application is contended" from "the daemon is starving the
  application."** From a session's side alone the two look identical, and one is a capacity problem
  while the other is a projection to move to its own file.
- **`TrackConnections` is inherited and refused by name**, following `SessionOptions.IsolationLevel`'s
  precedent. Deriving from the lifted base is right (do not reinvent a Critter Stack type), and it
  brings a member Fisher cannot honour honestly: a SQLite connection is a *file handle*, Weasel's
  `SqliteDataSource` is a factory rather than a pool (fisher#59 measured exactly that), and the pooling
  beneath it is Microsoft.Data.Sqlite's, keyed process-wide by connection string and not attributable
  to a store at all. A count charted beside Marten's would read as the same quantity and be a different
  one. **Refused rather than ignored**, because a knob that silently does nothing is the failure mode
  this codebase keeps meeting.
- **`fisher.events.appended` matches Marten's `TrackEventCounters` and earns its place for an extra
  reason**: on one file every appending writer is queued behind every other, so append volume charted
  against the wait separates "more work arrived" from "the same work is now waiting".
  `fisher.documents.written` has no Marten equivalent and exists for the same reason — three tag values
  rather than three instruments, because the useful chart is the commit's *mix*.
- **Every measurement carries `fisher.store`**, for the reason `FisherTracing` tags every span with it:
  two Fisher stores in one process are usually two *files* with a write lock each, so an untagged
  series adds two unrelated queues together. It is also what lets the tests filter a process-wide
  `MeterListener` down to their own store — the `ActivityListener` lesson, met again.
  `StoreName` is stamped onto the options in `DocumentStore`'s constructor rather than read from
  `StoreOptions`, because these options are constructed *inside* that constructor and the name is not
  final until an `IConfigureFisher` contribution has run.
- **The change-set counters are a session listener** (`FisherCommitMetrics`), registered only when
  something opted in — so a store with no counters carries no extra listener, and an empty unit of work
  fires no listeners at all. A failing counter is caught and logged rather than thrown: it runs after
  the commit, so throwing would surface to the caller as though a durable write had failed.
  They describe a **user session's** unit of work; the daemon's batch deliberately does not fire session
  listeners, and counting its raised events here would put the daemon's work on the application's series.

### Session logging

`IFisherLogger.cs` / `DefaultFisherLogger.cs` / `ConsoleFisherLogger.cs` (fisher#207) — Marten's
`IMartenLogger` + `IMartenSessionLogger` pair, so a logger ports across with a rename.
`StoreOptions.Logger(...)` is the store-level attachment and `session.Logger` the per-session
override; `AddFisher` attaches a `DefaultFisherLogger` over `ILogger<IDocumentStore>` unless one is
already there, exactly as `AddMarten` does. Statements are logged at the write batch, the LINQ
execution and the document load — the same three boundaries the spans are drawn at, and for the same
reasons.

**Parameter values are omitted by default, which is the one deliberate divergence from Marten**, whose
`DefaultMartenLogger` logs `p.Value` at Debug. Fisher logs the parameter's name and the CLR type of the
bound value (`@p0: (String)`) unless `LogSqlParameterValues` is set. Three reasons, and the first is
the deciding one:

- **Fisher already answered this question, the same way.** `ToSql` renders parameter *names*, "so the
  text is readable rather than executable". Defaulting the logger the other way leaves one store
  holding two opposite answers to whether Fisher may write bound values where a human reads them, and
  the quieter one would be the one nobody chose.
- **What is bound is the whole document.** An upsert binds the serialized body as a single parameter,
  as does an event append — so "log the parameter values" is "log every field of every document",
  verbatim, at Debug. (True of Marten too; the next one is not.)
- **Fisher is embedded, so the blast radius differs.** The log is very often a file on the same disk as
  the database, on a desktop or an edge box, and is what gets attached to a support ticket. Turning on
  Debug to find out why a query is slow should not be the same gesture as exporting the database.
- **The type shown is a diagnostic rather than a redaction marker**, which is what makes the default
  useful rather than merely safe: a `Guid` bound without conversion is a BLOB that can never match the
  TEXT the schema holds, and `(Guid)` where `(String)` belongs says so at once.

**Two Marten members are deliberately not ported**, each recorded on the interface:

- **The three `NpgsqlBatch` overloads** — Fisher executes one command per storage operation on
  purpose (4–6 ms vs 82–192 ms concatenated), so a batch overload could never fire, and a logger
  author would have to implement it to find that out. `SqliteBatch` exists; this is a decision, not a
  missing provider feature.
- **`IMartenLogger.SchemaChange(string sql)`** — Fisher already has that seam one layer down. All DDL
  goes through Weasel, and `FisherDatabase` derives from `DatabaseBase<T>` and so already implements
  `IDatabaseWithMigrationLogger`. A second switch for one stream of output would be bad; honouring it
  would be worse, because every Weasel provider's `executeDelta` branches on
  `logger is DefaultMigrationLogger` to decide whether a failed DDL statement rethrows with its
  original stack trace or is handed to `OnFailure` and then swallowed when `failureIsFatal` is false.

**`IFisherSessionLogger.Enabled` is Fisher's own member and is the whole hot-path story.** Marten's
`NulloMartenLogger` derives from `DefaultMartenLogger` over a `NullLogger`, so an unlogged Marten
command still makes a virtual call and an `IsEnabled` check per execution. Fisher's answers `false`
from a constant, and `FisherSession.IsLogging` checks a cached reference comparison first — so a
store built by hand pays a bool field read and a branch.

- ⚠️ **Every call site tests `IsLogging` *before* constructing any argument not already in hand.** That
  is fisher#165's shape held in advance: a `DaemonTrace.Record` call site whose interpolated-string
  argument was built ahead of the gate that would have rejected it. The one here is
  `RecordSavedChanges`, which wants an `IChangeSet` that `SaveChangesAsync` otherwise builds only when
  a listener is registered — so an unguarded call would put a per-commit allocation on every store to
  serve the ones that log. `SaveChangesAsync` builds it at most once for the logger and the listeners
  together.
- **Measured rather than argued.** `the_no_logger_path_allocates_nothing` asserts an exact zero from
  `GC.GetAllocatedBytesForCurrentThread` over 10,000 guarded calls; removing the guard makes it 720,000
  bytes (72 per command). `a_disabled_logger_is_never_asked_for_a_change_set` covers the other half —
  a logger answering `Enabled` false whose `RecordSavedChanges` being called *at all* is the evidence
  the guard moved inside the logger. Both were verified by reverting.
- **A tenant scope forwards `Logger` and `IsLogging` to its parent** rather than holding a copy. A
  scope shares the parent's unit of work, so its writes are the parent's commands; a scope with a
  logger of its own would split one transaction's log across two, and a caller who set `session.Logger`
  would not see reads made through `ForTenant`.
- **`RecordSavedChanges` fires for an enlisted session, where `IDocumentSessionListener.AfterCommitAsync`
  does not.** A listener is a side effect that must wait for visibility only the caller's commit can
  grant; a log line records that the statements ran, which they did.
- **`DefaultFisherLogger.StartSession` returns `this`**, as Marten's does, so a session costs no
  allocation — at the price of a shared stopwatch field, so under concurrency the *duration* on a line
  can be another session's. The SQL and the parameters are always right. A logger needing exact
  per-session timing returns a new instance instead.

### The document-side tooling surface

`IDocumentStoreUsageSource`, `IDocumentStoreDiagnostics` and projection step-through (fisher#44) —
three partials on `DocumentStore`, all implemented **explicitly** like the event-side ones.

Before this, Fisher answered the event half of every question a monitoring console asks and none of
the document half — which renders as "no documents" rather than "this store does not answer that".
Same outcome the standing discipline exists to prevent, reached by a different route: not a member
that throws, but an interface never implemented.

⚠️ **Implementing them was only half of it, and the other half was missing for four releases**
(fisher#303). `AddFisher` registered neither in the container, so a store-agnostic consumer resolving
`IDocumentStoreDiagnostics` from a Fisher host got **nothing** — and both interfaces document a
graceful-no-op pattern, so "not registered" renders as *the store has no documents* rather than as an
unanswered question. The CritterWatch document explorer could not browse a Fisher-backed service at
all, including the zero-infrastructure embedded configuration that is Fisher's best case.

- **It is the third instance of the same shape, and the shape is the lesson.** An unfilled slot on
  `EventStoreUsage` reads as a store with none (fisher#120); a store-agnostic interface implemented
  but not registered reads the same way one member over. Both are silent, both are invisible to the
  shared compliance suites, and both were found by pointing a console at Fisher rather than by any
  test here.
- **Nothing local caught it because `document_diagnostics` casts the store directly.** Every assertion
  about the *behaviour* passed while the only route a consumer actually takes returned nothing —
  which is exactly why the tests added for this resolve out of a real host instead.
- **The ancillary registrations unwrap the marker proxy**, the same rule the `IEventStore` bridge
  follows and for the same reason: a `DispatchProxy` implements the interfaces it was asked for, and
  both of these are explicit and absent from `IDocumentStore`. It matters more here than on either
  sibling, two Fisher stores usually being two *files* — a console that could not see the ancillary
  one would be missing a whole database rather than a schema.
- Polecat registers both for both stores and Marten registers the usage source; Fisher was the only
  one of the three registering neither.
- ⚠️ **The document identity is the STORE's, `fisher://{store}`, not the database file's** (fisher#353).
  `IDocumentStoreUsageSource.Subject` and `DocumentStoreUsage.SubjectUri` used to report
  `Database.Describe().DatabaseUri()`, which names the file and nothing narrower. So two stores sharing
  one file under different `DatabaseSchemaName`s — the layout `AddFisherStore<T>` exists for — reported
  one identity, and a console that picks a store by `SubjectUri` and resolves its diagnostics by
  `Subject` could not tell them apart. It also meant one `DocumentStore` gave two different answers to
  "which store are you?", since `IEventStore.Subject` had been the store's since fisher#279. Both halves
  now agree, as they do on Marten. **This changes a URI a consumer may already key on**, so it belongs
  in the release notes. The file is still reported, on `DocumentStoreUsage.Database`.

- **The usage sweep has to force the mappings into existence.** A mapping is created lazily on first
  use, so a store that has opened no session has none — exactly the state a console sees on a fresh
  boot. `MaterializeMappings` asks the schema for every projection's aggregate type first.
- **`PartitioningStrategy` is reported as null rather than omitted.** SQLite has no table
  partitioning, so the field has a value — none — rather than being unknown.
- **A DDL failure is reported as a SQL comment, not thrown.** One bad mapping should not take the whole
  store's description with it.
- **`QueryDocumentsAsync` is hand-built SQL, which makes it a fourth caller of the three implicit
  filters.** It cannot go through `Query<T>()`: a console names its type as a *string* and filters on
  *columns* (correlation id, causation id, last-modified-by) that are not document members, so there is
  no expression tree to build. The mitigation is that each filter is composed from the one place that
  owns it — `SoftDelete.NotDeletedSql`, `DocumentHierarchy.FilterSqlFor`, the tenant column — rather
  than re-spelled, and `diagnostics_reads_carry_the_implicit_filters` pins all three.
- **A table that does not exist reports an empty page.** SQLite resolves a table name when it
  *prepares* a statement, so a count against a type whose table was never created fails before any
  guard could run — the lesson rebuild teardown and `CleanAsync<T>` both learned, met again on a
  console's first click.
- **A sub-class resolves to its base's mapping plus a `doc_type` filter.** A registered sub-class has no
  mapping of its own, which is fisher#17's whole point; the name a console passes may still be one.
- **A console's id is converted through the mapping's identity type before it is bound.** Fourth
  appearance of the uppercase-Guid trap: `fi_doc_*.id` holds the lowercase canonical form under a
  case-sensitive collation, so binding the caller's string directly matches nothing.
- **Projection replay copies the aggregate at every step**, and this is the one thing Polecat's does
  not. JasperFx's aggregation mutates the aggregate in place, so a timeline built from live references
  shows the *final* state at every step — the single thing a step-through exists not to do. The copy
  goes through the store's own serializer, which also makes each captured state exactly what would have
  been persisted. Found by the test failing with `[1, 1, 1]` where `[1, 2, 1]` was expected.
- **A step's exception is recorded on the step rather than thrown**, or the first bad event would hide
  every step after it. An unknown event type is skipped, following the stream reads' policy rather than
  the daemon's: a console may be pointed at a store holding types this deployment does not know.

#### The grown diagnostics contract, and its writer — fisher#364

JasperFx 2.77.0 (jasperfx#870) made `IDocumentStoreDiagnostics.Subject` and `LoadDocumentAsync` abstract,
defined the semantics the three stores used to disagree on, and added `IDocumentStoreDiagnosticsWriter`.
`DocumentStoreDiagnosticsCompliance` pins it, and Fisher is enrolled.

- **`Where` / `OrderBy` are refused with `DocumentCriteriaNotSupportedException`, before the type is
  resolved.** They are Dynamic LINQ text for `Query<T>()` (jasperfx#869, still open). Splicing them into
  this hand-built SQL would add a fifth filter path with none of LINQ's member resolution. Returning the
  unfiltered page is the one answer the contract forbids.
  `SupportsDocumentDiagnosticCriteria` should flip only once they go through `Query<T>()`.
- **Tenant → `DocumentQueryOptions.NormalizeTenantId`, then `Tenancy.DatabaseFor`.** The read used
  `Database` unconditionally, so database-per-tenant answered every tenant from the default file.
- **`AllTenants` fans out, and fisher#368 said it would not need to** (jasperfx#928, JasperFx 2.78.0).
  The issue assumed Fisher had no database-per-tenant; it has, so a read of the default file alone would
  be the "default tenant's rows as though they were everyone's" answer the contract forbids.
  `QueryEveryTenantAsync` counts each database's matching rows per tenant (a `group by tenant_id` for a
  conjoined type, the file's tenant otherwise), sorts those segments by tenant **ordinally in .NET**, and
  reads only the segments the page overlaps, each `order by id`. One path serves one file, a file per
  tenant, and several tenants sharing a file — whose tenants interleave with other files' in tenant
  order, which is what `all_tenants_orders_by_tenant_across_shared_and_separate_files` pins.
  `AssertValidTenantScope()` runs before the criteria refusal; `LoadDocumentAsync` stays single-tenant.
- **A load by id includes soft-deleted rows, flagged; a page excludes them unless asked.**
- ⚠️ **The version token has three sources, and the third is a hash.** It is `guid_version`, rendered
  through `Guid` because Weasel's version binder stores it UPPERCASE. Otherwise it is the numeric
  revision. For a type with neither, it is SHA-256 of `last_modified` + `data`. `last_modified` alone is
  millisecond-precision, so two writes in one millisecond would share a token.
- ⚠️ **The writer checks the expected version under its own `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`, then saves through an
  ENLISTED session on that transaction.** That is the only shape where the check and the write are
  atomic. The session is seeded with the `guid_version` just read (`FisherSession.StoreForDiagnostics`),
  because fisher#245's guard is fed from what the session read. A session opened a moment ago has read
  nothing, so without the seed every console edit of an existing optimistic document fails. A numeric
  revision is written as 0 (auto): the JSON carries the revision the console read, and Marten's
  strictly-greater rule would refuse it.
- **The document table is ensured before the transaction**, because an enlisted session asserts rather
  than migrating; the migration runs on its own connection and would deadlock against the writer's lock.
- **The generic session members are reached through `InvokeClosed`, which unwraps
  `TargetInvocationException`.** An `ArgumentException` for an id mismatch has to reach the console as
  itself.
- **Registered for the main store and for each ancillary store** (unwrapped through the marker proxy),
  beside the reader. A writer implemented but never registered would be fisher#303 over again.
- `document_diagnostics_contract` covers what the suite cannot: database-per-tenant, both real version
  columns, and the structured `Indexes` / `DuplicatedFields` / `SerializerCasing` descriptors. It checks
  the descriptors against `sqlite_master` rather than against a list the test wrote.

### `Advanced`, cleaning and the projection scenario

`DocumentStore.Advanced` gained event store statistics, per-type cleaning, DDL script generation and
the projection scenario harness (fisher#42). Four independent pieces, none large.

- **`EventStoreStatistics` has three fields rather than two, and the third is the point.**
  `EventSequenceNumber` can exceed `EventCount`, because archiving, compacting or deleting events
  leaves the sequence where it was — `fi_events.seq_id` is `AUTOINCREMENT` and SQLite never reuses a
  value it handed out. That is load-bearing rather than incidental (a reused sequence below the
  daemon's high-water mark is an event no async projection ever sees), so the gap between the two
  numbers is the count of events that once existed and no longer do.
  **`sqlite_sequence` has no row until the first `AUTOINCREMENT` insert**, so the read is a `coalesce`
  and an untouched store reports 0 rather than throwing.
- **`CleanAsync<T>` matches against the tables that exist rather than issuing a blind `delete from`.**
  A document table is created on demand at first write, and SQLite resolves a table name when it
  *prepares* a statement — so cleaning a type that has never been written would fail before any guard
  in the SQL could run. Same lesson rebuild teardown learned. It is a real delete even for a
  soft-deleted type: flagging rows would leave a "cleaned" table that still answers `MaybeDeleted()`
  and still refuses an insert on a duplicate id.
- **`ToDatabaseScript()` is Weasel's**, inherited from `DatabaseBase` — Polecat writes its own only
  because it needs `GO` separators. `the_script_creates_the_same_schema_the_migration_does` applies the
  output to a fresh file and compares `sqlite_master`, which is the assertion worth having; that the
  string contains a table name is not.
- **`ProjectionScenario` is a seam and nothing else**, the same shape as `FisherProjectionDaemon` — the
  harness lives in JasperFx. Its teardown clears the event store and the document types the registered
  projections own, **not every table**: a scenario is entitled to seed documents its projections do not
  produce, and clearing those would make the harness quietly destructive.
  `the_teardown_leaves_unrelated_documents_alone` pins it.

### `Advanced` — the daemon escape hatches, single-stream rebuild and the tenant wipe

fisher#173 — the `AdvancedOperations` members Marten carries and Fisher did not. Four independent
pieces; two of them are operational escape hatches whose value is that they exist before you need
them.

- **`AdvanceHighWaterMarkToLatestAsync`** moves the high-water mark straight to `max(seq_id)`, for
  retrofitting async projections onto a store that has never had any — otherwise the mark climbs from
  zero, which on a large store is a long read with nothing to show for it. **It advances the mark and
  not the shards**, which is the half that decides whether it is the right call: a shard with no
  progression row still starts at zero, so this is for a store whose projections are new *and* whose
  history is genuinely not wanted. Spans every database, with a tenant-scoped overload that means
  something only under database-per-tenant — a conjoined store has one global sequence however many
  tenants write into it.
- **`TryCorrectProgressInDatabaseAsync`** pulls a progression row that has advanced past the highest
  sequence back down to it. **Reachable here through an ordinary supported operation, where Marten
  carries the same method for a PostgreSQL race it believes it has closed**: `seq_id` is
  `AUTOINCREMENT`, and stream compacting and event masking both delete rows, so removing events from
  the top of the table lowers `max(seq_id)` below progress already recorded. A shard stranded above
  the ceiling never advances again and `QueryForNonStaleData` waits on it forever, with nothing saying
  why.
  - **Clamped per row, where Marten resets every row wholesale** the moment the high-water row is
    ahead. That drags a shard genuinely *behind* the head forward, past events it never applied —
    silently, and on the very store somebody is already repairing.
    `correcting_leaves_a_shard_that_is_merely_behind_alone` is the discriminating fact.
- **`AllProjectionProgress` / `ProjectionProgressFor` / `AllAsyncProjectionShardNames`** were a
  surfacing job rather than new machinery: the first two have been on `FisherDatabase` since the
  daemon landed, reachable only by casting the store to `IEventStore` and walking `AllDatabases()`. An
  omitted tenant id spans every database — concatenating for the first, taking the highest for the
  second — which under database-per-tenant means one shard name appears once per tenant, deliberately:
  collapsing them would have to pick a winner, and "at 40 for one tenant and 900 for another" is what
  an operator came to find out.
- **`RebuildSingleStreamAsync<T>`** live-aggregates one stream and stores the result, for the repair
  that does not need the daemon.
  - **A stream that folds to nothing deletes the document, where Marten's throws from inside
    `Store(null!)`.** That case is not exotic — a `ShouldDelete` that fired, an archived stream, an id
    with no events — and "no document" is exactly what a real rebuild leaves for such a stream, since
    teardown clears the rows and the replay never recreates that one. Throwing would make the method
    unusable on the streams most likely to have gone wrong.
  - **Refused by name for a type with no Fisher mapping.** A projection registered through
    `Projections.StorageProviders` (an EF Core entity) is deliberately never mapped, so `Store` would
    create a `fi_doc_*` table nothing else ever reads — a rebuild that silently wrote to the wrong
    place.
- **`DeleteAllTenantDataAsync`**, and the distinction it rests on. **Fisher refuses tenant
  *deletion*** — deprovisioning here means deleting a *file*, the cheapest deprovisioning of any
  Critter Stack store and the most irreversible, and Fisher cannot know whether that file is backed up
  (see "Runtime tenants"). Wiping a tenant's *rows* is a different operation: it destroys nothing a
  file restore would be needed to recover, it is the only way to erase a conjoined tenant at all, and
  nothing covered it.
  - **Under database-per-tenant it clears the tenant's file and keeps it**, so the tenant goes on
    working and simply has no data. Removing the file stays the operator's act.
  - **Tag rows go first, through their events.** `fi_event_tag_*` carries no tenant of its own and has
    a real foreign key to `fi_events(seq_id)`, so the delete is a subselect and it has to precede the
    events — fisher#6's ordering met again with a tenant predicate on it.
  - **Progression rows are left alone**, under either tenancy. They describe how far the daemon read,
    not what a tenant owns, and clearing them would make every shard replay a store that is now empty.
    That is also why this needs no daemon pause, unlike `ResetAllDataAsync`.
  - ⚠️ **"Has a `tenant_id` column" is not the question, and reading it as one makes the refusal
    unreachable.** `fi_events`, `fi_streams` and `fi_dead_letters` carry the column on *every* store —
    the event tables get it with a default under non-conjoined tenancy, and a dead letter records the
    failing event's tenant as ordinary data. What the guard asks is what the store was *configured* to
    slice by: a database per tenant, conjoined events, or at least one `MultiTenanted()` document type,
    which is the only thing that puts the column on a `fi_doc_*` table. A store with none of those is
    refused by name rather than reporting a successful erasure of nothing.

### `Advanced` and cleaning

`DocumentStore.Advanced` carries `Clean` (`IDocumentCleaner`), `ResetAllDataAsync` and
`ResetHiloSequenceFloorAsync<T>`. Two things about the cleaner are SQLite-specific rather than
arbitrary:

- **Scoping is by table prefix**, because there is no schema to scope to. `PrefixFor(schemaName)` is
  the entire isolation boundary between two logical stores in one file, and
  `cleaning_one_logical_store_does_not_touch_another_in_the_same_file` is what holds it.
- **Table matching is done in C#, not with `LIKE`.** `_` is a single-character wildcard in SQL's
  LIKE and every Fisher prefix contains one, so `like 'fi_%'` would happily match a table called
  `fixtures`. Names come back from `sqlite_master` and are filtered with `StartsWith`.
- **`DeleteAllEventDataAsync` deletes in a fixed order**, tag tables first — see "Dead letters".
  `CompletelyRemoveAllAsync` needs no ordering: SQLite does not enforce a foreign key against a
  dropped table.

`CompletelyRemoveAllAsync` calls `FisherDatabase.ForgetEnsuredTables()` afterwards. Without it the
"this document table already exists" cache would still claim tables that were just dropped, and the
next `Store` would skip its migration and write to nothing.

### Natural keys

`fi_natural_key_<alias>` and `Events/Storage/NaturalKey*.cs` (fisher#40) — addressing a stream by the
business identifier it was created with. **The definition, the attributes and the discovery are all
JasperFx's** (`NaturalKeyDefinition`, `[NaturalKey]`, `[NaturalKeySource]`,
`JasperFxAggregationProjectionBase`), so what Fisher supplies is the storage seam, the same division as
the async daemon. Ported in shape from Polecat's `Events/Schema` + `Events/Projections` + `Events/Fetching`
set, with four things different and each of them a decision:

- **No `is_archived` column on the lookup table.** Polecat copies the flag from `pc_streams` and keeps
  it in sync from a projection watching for the `Archived` event. Fisher archives with a direct
  operation rather than an event, so there is nothing to watch; and the lookup joins `fi_streams`
  anyway, so reading the flag off the join makes the streams table the only place that knows. Removing
  the filter makes `an_archived_stream_no_longer_resolves` fail. **This is the one decision fisher#206
  did not overturn, and it got stronger** — see the replay section below for why a replay rewriting a
  lookup row is harmless here and would need care on either sibling.
- ⚠️ **The rows are written by an inline projection with a replay path, and this reversed a decision**
  (fisher#206). `NaturalKeyWriter` used to run from `FisherSession.SaveChangesAsync` beside
  `EventTagWriter`, and argued that a key row is an index over streams rather than a projection of
  them, so the sibling stores' second rebuild-time entry point was a cost their shape imposed and
  Fisher's did not. **The premise was right and the conclusion was backwards**: the writer drove off
  the unit of work's `StreamAction`s, and only an *append* produces one — so a natural key could never
  be backfilled onto a stream that already existed, and a rebuild could never repopulate the table.
  Adopting a key on a live store left its whole history unreachable by the identifier it was created
  with, permanently and with nothing to say so. See "Natural keys have a replay path" below.
- **A second stream claiming a key is refused, where Polecat repoints.** Polecat's `MERGE` updates the
  stream id on conflict, so the newcomer silently takes the key and the original stream becomes
  unreachable by the identifier it was created with. Fisher's conflict clause carries
  `where stream_id = excluded.stream_id` and returns the row it settled on — same stream returns it, a
  new key returns it, a conflicting stream matches nothing — and "no row" becomes
  `DuplicateNaturalKeyException`. That is the same shape the optimistic document upsert reads its
  version guard with. Re-asserting the *same* mapping stays idempotent, which it has to be: every
  event carrying the key rewrites the row.
- **No foreign key to `fi_streams`, uniformly.** Polecat declares one for a single-tenant store and
  omits it under conjoined tenancy, where Weasel.SqlServer's alphabetical column sorting breaks the
  composite mapping — so its two tenancy styles behave differently. One rule beats referential
  integrity in half the configurations, and a row whose stream is gone resolves to nothing anyway
  because the join is what produces an answer.

Two behaviours the shared suite settled, both of which Fisher had wrong until it ran (fisher#184):

- **Renaming a natural key retires the previous one.** A stream has exactly one *current* key, so the
  upsert is followed by a delete of every other row naming that stream — after the duplicate guard,
  never before, so a rename refused because the new key is live elsewhere leaves the existing mapping
  alone. Fisher used to leave the old row behind, which is not merely untidy: a retired alias that
  resolves forever also occupies its slot in the lookup's primary key forever, so no other stream can
  ever claim that identifier. Both siblings had reframed the same behaviour as a defect
  (polecat#435 / marten#5041) and Fisher was the third.
- **`FetchLatestByNaturalKey` answers a miss with null, where `FetchForWritingByNaturalKey` throws.**
  The asymmetry is the contract rather than an oversight: `FetchForWriting` is the read half of a
  read-modify-write and has to say what it would be writing to, where `FetchLatest(...) is null` is
  the idiomatic "does this aggregate exist?" probe — the same probe fisher#88 made honest for the
  by-id overload. Throwing made the key-shaped spelling the one member of the family that could not
  answer its own question. The `FetchForWriting` miss is deliberately outside shared scope
  (jasperfx#764), because that is the one place the three stores genuinely disagree: Marten hands back
  a null aggregate, Polecat throws `InvalidOperationException`, Fisher throws
  `UnknownNaturalKeyException`.

Two more things:

- **Resolving outside the write transaction is safe, and it is the same argument the optimistic append
  rests on.** The version guard runs inside the write transaction regardless, so a stale resolution
  fails the commit rather than writing a wrong version. A lock would only buy the loser waiting instead
  of failing — the trade Fisher already makes everywhere.
- **A Guid stream id binds as lowercase canonical text.** Third table where getting that wrong is
  silent, after documents and tag rows, and the failure mode is identical: every lookup returns
  nothing. Verified by binding the uppercase form, which makes the round-trip test throw
  `UnknownNaturalKeyException`.

`DeleteAllEventDataAsync` clears the lookup tables with the rest. Leaving them behind is not cosmetic:
the duplicate guard would then fire on data that no longer exists, and the compliance fixture cleans
before every test.

#### Natural keys have a replay path — fisher#206

`Events/Storage/NaturalKeyProjection.cs` and `NaturalKeyOperations.cs` replace `NaturalKeyWriter`.
**One set of SQL, two entry points**, which is Marten's shape (`NaturalKeyProjection` +
`QueueUpsertsForEvents`) rather than a new one:

| Path | Where | Statement |
|---|---|---|
| Append | `FisherSession.ApplyInlineProjectionsAsync` → a queued `NaturalKeyClaimOperation` | guarded upsert, `returning`, refuses a live duplicate |
| Replay | `DocumentStore.StartProjectionBatchAsync` → a queued `NaturalKeyReplayOperation` | unguarded upsert, last-writer-wins |

- ⚠️ **The refusal stays in the SQL and must not become a pre-flight read** (marten#5349). A probing
  `SELECT` before the write races: two sessions both find the key free and the loser's upsert repoints
  the row exactly as an unguarded one would. The guard is a `where` on the `do update`, so a
  conflicting claimant matches no row and the `returning` clause yields nothing —
  `the_claim_refuses_in_the_statement_rather_than_after_a_read` asserts the mechanism, because a store
  could pass the behavioural compliance fact with a pre-flight read and be wrong only under
  contention.
- **The claim moved from executing directly to being queued**, which is what the conversion bought and
  also its one behavioural nuance: the refusal is now raised from `PostprocessAsync` and collected by
  `ExecuteBatchAsync` rather than thrown mid-flight, so the operations after it still run before the
  batch throws. Nothing survives either way — it is all one transaction — and it is the shape
  `NaturalKeyClaimOperation` shares with the optimistic document upsert's version guard.
- ⚠️ **The replay must not re-adjudicate** (marten#4966). Refusing on replay would turn a pre-existing
  data condition into a shard that can never advance again, with no caller present to correct the key
  derivation the refusal blames — and there is nothing legitimate to refuse anyway, since a refused
  append rolls its own events back, so a replay never meets the losing stream's events.
  `a_replay_does_not_re_adjudicate_a_duplicate_key` plants the condition the only way it can occur:
  events written while no key was declared.
- **Every daemon page, not only a rebuild.** The hook is in `StartProjectionBatchAsync` because that
  is where the range's events are, and it writes onto the batch's own session so the rows commit with
  the shard's progression row. A fresh async shard catching up from zero backfills exactly as a
  rebuild does, and there is no reason to make the two differ.
- **Not registered on the projection graph.** Marten's is an `IInlineProjection` plus a direct hook
  rather than an `IProjectionSource`, and Fisher follows: giving it a shard would put a
  separately-rebuildable projection in front of an operator that indexes streams they never registered
  anything for.
- **An archived stream is doubly protected, and the first guard was not designed for this.** The event
  loader excludes an archived stream's events unless a shard asks for them, so the replay never sees
  the stream at all — pinned by `a_replay_cannot_resurrect_an_archived_streams_key`, which asserts the
  table stays empty. And *if* a shard did include archived events, the row coming back would still be
  harmless, because Fisher's lookup carries no `is_archived` column and the answer is read off the
  join. Polecat and Marten keep the flag on the row and would have to be careful.
- **Fisher's rebuild teardown still does not clear the lookup**, and that is unchanged: the sweep
  looks at mapped document types and `IPublishesTables`, and the lookup is neither. So
  `a_rebuild_repopulates_a_lookup_that_was_emptied` plants the emptied state directly rather than
  waiting for a teardown to produce it — the property worth having is "a replay can rebuild this
  table", and a rebuild-then-fetch test would instead be asserting that teardown happens to leave it
  alone.

### The `IEventStoreOperations` surface

`EventOperations` implements JasperFx's `IEventStoreOperations` in full — the interface the
cross-store compliance suites route everything through, so declaring it is what makes
`EventStoreComplianceFixture.EventsFor(session)` possible at all.

Everything reachable without document storage is real: `FetchForWriting` rebuilds the aggregate by
live aggregation, `WriteToAggregate` is fetch + callback + `SaveChangesAsync`, and `ProjectLatest`
folds the session's pending events on top of the committed state.

**`FetchLatest` is the exception, and it reads a document rather than folding** — see below.

#### `FetchLatest` reads an Inline aggregate's document

`EventOperations.CanReadInlineDocument` (fisher#88, the polecat#463 class). `FetchLatest<T>` used to
live-aggregate the stream for *every* `T`, whatever its lifecycle, and the doc comment said so —
adding that Fisher had no snapshot storage to read instead, which stopped being true when
`Projections.Snapshot<T>` landed. So the claim aged into a bug: JasperFx's `InlineFetchPlanner` routes
an Inline aggregate to its projected document, and Fisher kept folding.

**The visible difference is a stream that exists but holds nothing `T` owns.** Marten and Polecat find
no document and return null; Fisher folded the foreign events and handed back whatever the aggregator
constructed. That matters because `FetchLatest<T>(id) is null` is the idiomatic "does this aggregate
exist?" probe — so the probe was satisfied by any stream id holding events at all, and the answer
depended on whether some other aggregate happened to share the id space.

- **A default-constructed aggregate is not neutral**, which is what makes this worse than an empty
  answer. A conventional `Create`/`Apply` aggregate came out null anyway, because nothing built an
  instance; the shape that surfaces it is a catch-all `Evolve(IEvent)`, which accepts every event type
  by construction. The reported case had `bool IsActive` defaulting to `true`, so the phantom read as
  an **active alert** for a service that had none.
- **Reading the document is what the write side already believed.** The inline projection screens out
  streams it does not own, which is exactly why no row was ever written for them; the read path now
  agrees. `no_document_is_written_for_a_stream_the_aggregate_does_not_handle` pins both halves
  together — it passed before the fix, and keeping it is the point.
- **Inline only**, mirroring `InlineFetchPlanner`. A Live aggregate has no document to read, and Marten
  routes an Async one to the document only when the mapping is revisioned.
- **Gated on the type having a Fisher mapping**, which is what keeps an EF Core-backed projection on
  the old path: a type registered with `Projections.StorageProviders` is deliberately never mapped, so
  its rows are in no `fi_doc_*` table and `LoadAsync` would answer about a table nothing writes to.
  `HasMappingFor` is the same question the storage registry is itself constructed with, and unlike
  `MappingFor` it does not create a mapping as a side effect of asking.
- **And gated on the key type**, because a stream identity and a document identity are not always the
  same type — a natural key resolves to a stream *key* (string) for an aggregate whose document id is a
  Guid, and that key cannot address the document at all. Those fall back to live aggregation exactly as
  before.
- **`IdType` rather than `StoredIdType`, which is the one place Polecat's version does not port.**
  Polecat compares the *inner* type so a strong-typed id matches on the value it wraps, because its
  load path re-wraps on the way through; Fisher's does not. `LoadAsync<T>(Guid)` resolves storage by
  hard-casting to `IDocumentStorage<T, Guid>`, and a strong-typed aggregate's storage is keyed on the
  wrapper — so unwrapping passes the gate and then throws `InvalidCastException` from inside the load.
  **`StrongTypedIdentityCompliance` is what caught it**, which is the argument for the suites in one
  line: the gate looked right, matched the sibling it was ported from, and was wrong. Comparing
  `IdType` leaves a strong-typed aggregate folding the stream exactly as before, so the phantom
  survives for that shape alone; fisher#89's `LoadAsync<T>(object)` is the entry point that resolves a
  canonical and a wrapped identity alike, and widening this is what it makes possible.
- **`FetchForWriting` deliberately still folds**, as it does on Polecat. The two ask different
  questions: `FetchLatest` reports current state, where `FetchForWriting` is the read half of a
  read-modify-write whose guard is the stream's version — so the fold is what the version it hands back
  has to agree with.

**Nothing on `IEventStoreOperations` throws any more.** What did lived in
`EventOperations.Unsupported.cs`, one file on purpose so that file shrinking was the progress
measure; it reached zero members and was deleted. Reintroduce it, rather than scattering throws, if a
future JasperFx release widens the interface past what Fisher implements.
**`FetchForWriting<T, TId>` and `FetchLatest<T, TId>` are whole now too**, which they were not for a
long time: in the siblings that overload is the natural-key and strong-typed-id entry point, fisher#14
closed the second half and fisher#40 the first. **The stream identity type wins where the two
coincide** — a string id on a string-identity store is read as the stream key — because which reading
applies must not depend on whichever aggregate types happen to declare a key.
`FetchForWritingByNaturalKey` / `FetchLatestByNaturalKey` are the unambiguous spellings.

One Fisher-specific hazard in this area: pending streams are tracked in a **dictionary keyed by
identity**, where Polecat uses a list. `FetchForWriting` must therefore reuse an already-tracked
`StreamAction` rather than construct a fresh one — replacing the dictionary entry would silently drop
events an earlier `Append` had queued for the same stream in the same session.

#### The aggregate write cache

`Events.CacheAggregatesForWriting<T>()` and `EventOperations.AggregateForWritingAsync` (fisher#97 /
jasperfx#674) — a node-local, opt-in, second-level cache of aggregate snapshots between
`FetchForWriting` calls. The contract, the key, the default bounded implementation and the registration
surface are all JasperFx's; what Fisher supplies is the fetch path, which is the same division as the
async daemon.

**Grade 1 and only grade 1.** The cached snapshot is a *baseline*: the stream version is read on every
call whether the take hit or missed, the events after the baseline are folded on, and the optimistic
guard still runs inside the write transaction. A stale entry costs a larger fold — never a wrong
aggregate, never a suppressed concurrency failure. The "trusted" variant that also skips the version
read is retired upstream against a measurement (0.19 ms of a 13.2 ms round); **do not reintroduce it**,
and if `a_cached_baseline_cannot_suppress_a_concurrency_exception` ever fails, that is what has
happened.

- **What a hit removes here is bigger than on either sibling, and it is a different thing.** Marten and
  Polecat load a stored snapshot and fold what follows, so the cache removes a *document read*. Fisher's
  `FetchForWriting` deliberately folds the whole stream on every call — see `CanReadInlineDocument` for
  why it does not read the Inline document the way `FetchLatest` does — so a hit removes *the fold of
  the history*. The measurements behind jasperfx#674 are PostgreSQL round trips and do not transfer;
  the saving is real here for a different reason.
- **No enabled/disabled branch anywhere.** `ResolveCache(Type)` hands back `NulloAggregateWriteCache`
  for an unenrolled type, so the ordinary path is unchanged: every take misses and every store is
  dropped. `RecordAggregateCacheWriteBack` returns early on the nullo cache, so an unenrolled fetch also
  allocates nothing.
- **Nothing is stored at fetch time, and the reason is take-on-read rather than poisoning.** An entry
  written while the caller still holds the instance can be claimed by a second session, which folds
  *its* delta onto the very object the first caller is still reading — the aggregate would silently gain
  state nobody in that session appended. Since the whole subject is that caching is unobservable except
  in latency, that is disqualifying. The write-back is deferred to the end of the unit of work, as
  Marten's is.
- **The version stored is the one read *before* the unit of work appended anything**, which is where
  Fisher diverges from the issue's advice to take it from the committed `StreamAction`. That advice is
  for a store whose inline projection mutates the very instance `FetchForWriting` handed out; **Fisher's
  does not** — it loads the snapshot document and builds its own — so labelling the instance with the
  committed version would claim events it has not applied, and the next fetch would fold them twice.
  `aggregate_write_cache.the_inline_projection_leaves_the_fetched_aggregate_alone` pins the premise,
  because it is a fact about Fisher rather than a choice, and the write-back is wrong the moment it
  stops holding.
- **A failed commit therefore needs no compensation.** The baseline describes committed state that
  existed either way, so there is no poisoned entry — which is also why the flush runs for an enlisted
  session, where the post-commit hooks do not. It runs outside the resilience pipeline for fisher#12's
  reason.
- **A fetch that never commits leaves nothing behind**, having consumed the entry it claimed. The
  contract expects that: an implementation may evict whenever it likes, and dropping an entry is always
  sound.
- **The key's database identifier carries the logical store as well as the file.** Under
  database-per-tenant `FisherDatabase.Identifier` already separates two files; within one file two
  logical stores are separated by the table prefix rather than by a schema, so `DatabaseSchemaName` is
  folded in. `AggregateWriteCacheOptions.Cache` names exactly that collision as the one its key cannot
  close. The tenant component is always the session's — Fisher has no aggregate registered as global,
  and under conjoined tenancy two tenants share a stream id space.
- **A rewritten event below a baseline is the one real hole, and it is not closable here.** A cached
  baseline is derived state, so masking or overwriting an event body leaves it holding what the old body
  produced — the same caveat a snapshot, document or flat table already carries, and the caveat masking
  is documented under. Evicting on rewrite would close it only within the rewriting process: the cache
  is node-local by construction, so another node's entry is unreachable. Documented as a reason to leave
  a rewritten aggregate unenrolled rather than half-closed with a guarantee the design cannot make.
- **Compacting needs nothing**, and that is worth knowing rather than assuming: JasperFx's aggregator
  calls `Compacted<T>.MaybeFastForward` before folding, so a delta that reaches the snapshot event
  *replaces* the baseline outright. A baseline below a compaction point heals on the next fetch for
  free.

`AggregateWriteCacheCompliance` (14 tests) is the definition — its subject is that a hit is
indistinguishable from a miss, including when the baseline is stale, ahead of the stream, or evicted.
Every one of those facts is vacuously true of a store that ignored the opt-in, which is why the suite
brings its own recording cache and asserts a nonzero hit count. Verified by disabling the take: exactly
the two hit-count facts fail. `aggregate_write_cache` covers what the suite cannot see — the premise
above, the write-back's timing and version, the tenant and logical-store components of the key, and
that an unenrolled type never reaches the cache at all.

### Live aggregation

`EventGraph` implements `IAggregationSourceFactory<IQuerySession>`: given an aggregate type it closes
`Fisher.Projections.SingleStreamProjection<TDoc, TId>` (which only closes the JasperFx base over
Fisher's session types) and asserts validity. `EventGraph.AggregatorFor<T>` is the single seam every
live aggregation goes through, and it defers to `FisherProjectionOptions.AggregatorFor<T>` — the
shared `ProjectionGraph` implementation, which checks registered projections first and only then falls
back to this factory. Fisher cannot register a projection yet, so auto-discovery is still the whole
story; routing through the graph is what makes a registered projection win once there is one.

Two things that are not obvious:

- **Conventional `Apply`/`Create`/`ShouldDelete` dispatch is compile-time only.** JasperFx's source
  generator emits the dispatcher; there is no runtime fallback. The generator keys it on
  `(TDoc, TId)`, resolving `TId` from the aggregate's identity member — so an aggregate with no `Id`
  gets no dispatcher at all. `AggregateIdentity.ResolveIdType` therefore *requires* an identity member
  and says so, rather than defaulting to the stream identity primitive and failing later with a
  message about a missing generated dispatcher. The generator runs in the assembly that defines the
  aggregate, which is why `Fisher.Tests` references `JasperFx.Events.SourceGenerator`.
- **`TId` is the aggregate's own id type, not the stream identity primitive.** They coincide for a
  plain `Guid Id`, but a strong-typed id is a wrapper struct and the generated dispatcher is keyed on
  the wrapper.

`AggregateIdentity` resolves identity through the shared `JasperFx.DocumentIdentity` helper. When
`DocumentMapping` arrives it should resolve identity *through* `AggregateIdentity` rather than beside
it, so the live-aggregation and snapshot paths cannot disagree about what `TId` is.

### The `IEventStore` surface

`DocumentStore` is `partial`; its `IEventStore` implementation lives in
`DocumentStore.EventStore.cs` and is written **explicitly** (`Uri IEventStore.Subject => ...`), as
Polecat does, so none of a tooling-only surface lands on the store's own public API.

Most of `IEventStore` is default-implemented by JasperFx and deliberately left alone. Fisher supplies
the required members plus the three things `EventStoreExplorerCompliance` exercises:
`GetRecentStreamsAsync`, `GetStreamMetadataAsync` and `TryCreateUsage`. The required members it
**Nothing on `IEventStore` throws any more** — `OpenReadOnlyEventStore` was the last one and fisher#15
closed it. The standing discipline, for the next member that arrives ahead of the feature, is that one
Fisher cannot honour throws naming its milestone rather than returning an empty result a monitoring
tool would render as "no data". `CompactStreamAsync` is live; see "Stream compacting". The generic half of the interface, and `BuildProjectionDaemonAsync`
with it, lives in `DocumentStore.Daemon.cs` — see "The async daemon" below.

`OpenReadOnlyEventStore` returns `FisherReadOnlyEventStore`, which **owns session lifetime rather than
capturing a session** — the one divergence from Polecat here, and it is dialect-forced. Polecat returns
`QuerySession().Events` directly, and since `IReadOnlyEventStore` is not `IDisposable` nothing ever
disposes that session. A `FisherSession` caches its `SqliteConnection` for its whole lifetime and
releases it only in `DisposeAsync`, so the same shape would leak a pooled connection against a single
database file on every call — to a method whose caller is a polling monitoring tool. Opening a session
per read costs a pool checkout, which for an embedded database is a rounding error next to that.

**That shape is also what makes `OpenReadOnlyEventStore(tenantId)` nearly free** (jasperfx#888). The
interface's default throws for any non-null tenant, which would leave the whole tier unreachable on a
store whose default tenant is refused, and leave its tenant-*less* members — `FetchStreamAsync` and
`FetchStreamStateAsync`, whose signatures carry nowhere to name a tenant — answering about an arbitrary
one on a store whose default tenant is not. Since the tier already opens a session per read precisely so
it holds none, the tenant goes on the session: every read it serves is then scoped by the same code that
scopes an application's, so there is no per-member tenant term for a later member to forget.
`QueryStreamStates` and `EventQuery.TenantId` keep taking their own, being the two members that already
had somewhere to put one. **A tenant on a store that is not multi-tenanted is refused rather than
ignored**, the rule `QueryStreamStates` already followed one member over: `DefaultTenancy.DatabaseFor`
resolves any id, so a quietly-unscoped reader would report every tenant's events as that tenant's.

**`HasEventStore` (jasperfx#914, fisher#354) is computed, never defaulted**: any registered event type
other than `Archived`, or `Projections.IsActive()` — Marten's `EventGraph.IsActive` rule. The interface
default is `true`, which makes a document-only store indistinguishable from an event store to a console
deciding whether to poll it. Read on every call, because an event type registered on first append turns
a document-only store into an event store.

`EventOperations.QueryEventsAsync(EventQuery)` is the paging read behind it. Two things in it are
load-bearing, and both were verified by removing them:

- **A `StreamId` filter is parsed and re-rendered under Guid identity**, for the same reason
  `GetStreamMetadataAsync` does it — `fi_events.stream_id` holds the lowercase canonical form and
  SQLite's default collation is case-sensitive. Binding the caller's string directly makes an uppercase
  Guid match nothing, so the Explorer renders an existing stream as empty. Without the parse,
  `a_stream_id_filter_matches_regardless_of_guid_casing` returns 0 where it expects 3.
- **The three metadata filters are gated on the options that create their columns.** `correlation_id`,
  `causation_id` and `user_name` do not exist on `fi_events` unless the matching `Enable*` option is on,
  so an ungated filter is not an empty result but `SQLite Error 1: no such column`. Ignoring the filter
  is what `EventQuery` asks for and what Polecat does.

**The two spellings of the tag filter are two renderings, not one folded into the other** (fisher#230
/ jasperfx#801). `TagConditions` is the rich CLR-typed form and its conditions are **OR'd**;
`TagValues` is the lossy name/value dictionary and its entries are **AND'd**, then AND'd with every
other filter. Same `seq_id in (select seq_id from <tag table> where value = …)` sub-select on both —
chosen over a join because a join multiplies rows when one event carries several matching tags, which
is also what keeps `TotalCount` counting distinct events. Supplying both is refused by
`EventQuery.AssertIsWellFormed`, which `AssertFiltersAreSupported` calls first thing, so the existing
call site gets it for free.

Three decisions in the lossy form:

- **The name is resolved by the shared `TagTypeRegistrationExtensions.RequireByTagName`**, not by
  anything of Fisher's: a caller holding only a store descriptor and a name cannot discover which
  spelling an engine accepts, so the CLR simple name (`ManifestId`) and the registered table suffix
  (`manifest`) both resolve, case-insensitively, on every store. An unregistered name is an
  `ArgumentException` **listing what is registered** rather than an empty answer — "that tag type does
  not exist here" and "no event carries that tag" must not read alike.
- **Case-insensitive value matching is done by normalising the caller's value where the stored form is
  canonical, and by `collate nocase` only where it is not.** `EventTagWriter.ToDatabaseValue` renders a
  Guid as lowercase canonical text and a number as an INTEGER, so for those the caller's spelling is
  converted and compared with a plain `=`, which the tag table's `(value, seq_id)` primary key serves
  as a range scan; a value that does not parse binds as typed and therefore matches nothing, which is
  the right answer rather than an error. Only a **string** tag needs `collate nocase`, its stored text
  being the application's own casing with nothing to normalise to — and that one comparison cannot
  reach the primary key index, since SQLite reaches an index only under the index's own collation. A
  string-tag lookup in this spelling therefore scans the tag table, which is the honest price of the
  contract and is confined to the tag table rather than to `fi_events`.
- **SQLite's `NOCASE` folds ASCII only**, where .NET's `OrdinalIgnoreCase` folds the whole of Unicode,
  so a non-ASCII string tag matches by exact casing here. Recorded rather than worked around: the
  alternative is a scan with a custom collation, for a difference no shared fact exercises.

Fisher does not implement the dictionary `IEventStore.QueryByTagsAsync` overload at all, so there is no
second code path to keep in step — `TagValues` is the better home for that capability anyway, being
composable and paged where the overload is neither.

The count is a second statement rather than `count(*) over ()`, because a window function returns no
row at all for a page past the end — and "page 9 of a 3-page result" is exactly when a tool most needs
the real total. `a_page_past_the_end_still_reports_the_total` pins it.

Three SQLite-specific points:

- **`GetStreamMetadataAsync` parses the incoming Guid string and re-renders it.** That is not
  redundant. `fi_streams.id` holds the lowercase canonical form and SQLite's default collation is
  case-sensitive, so an uppercase Guid string matches nothing — the same trap
  `SqliteGuidIdentification` exists for. The shared compliance suite cannot catch a regression here
  because it only ever passes `Guid.ToString()`, which is already lowercase;
  `event_store_explorer.stream_metadata_is_found_regardless_of_guid_casing` is what pins it.
- **Recent-stream ordering is `order by timestamp desc` over TEXT** — a string sort, correct only
  while `SqliteTimestamp.Format` stays fixed-width, UTC and millisecond-precision. A format with a
  variable-width offset or no sub-second component would silently mis-order streams written in the
  same second.
- **Rows are materialised inside the resilience pipeline, not streamed out of it.** A retried
  `SQLITE_BUSY` re-executes the whole delegate, so yielding a live reader to the caller would let a
  retry resume against a connection the previous attempt had already disposed.

`fi_streams`' column projection stays in `FisherStreamsRowReader` — `ReadStreamSummary` and
`ReadStreamMetadata` sit beside `Read`, so all three move together when the table's shape does.
`ReadStreamMetadata` returns an **empty tag dictionary, not null**: the record declares `Tags`
non-nullable, and returning null there is what polecat#412 was.

#### The explorer reads have a database dimension — fisher#240

jasperfx#810 gave every explorer read a third scope: `GetRecentStreamsAsync`, `ReadStreamAsync`,
`GetStreamMetadataAsync`, `QueryByTagsAsync` and `GetProjectionStatusesAsync` each take an
`IEventDatabase` overload beside the tenant-scoped one. The interface's default delegates on a
single-database store and refuses otherwise — a default interface member, so **nothing breaks at
compile time and nothing tells you the store is wrong.**

**The question the issue opened with had a stale answer written into this codebase in two places.**
`DocumentStore.EventStore.cs` claimed in prose that "Fisher has no database-per-tenant tenancy, so the
cardinality is always `Single`" while the expression beside it deferred to `Tenancy.Cardinality` —
which has answered `StaticMultiple` since fisher#47 and `DynamicMultiple` since fisher#58. The comment
predates both and was never revisited; `database_per_tenant.tooling_sees_every_tenants_database` had
been asserting the opposite for as long.

So Fisher **is** multi-database, and the pre-existing bug jasperfx#810 predicts was real here: every
one of these reads went to `Database`, the store's *default* file. A database-per-tenant store answered
from one tenant and the result was indistinguishable from the whole store's — right for whoever owned
the default file, wrong for everybody else, silent either way.

- **The listing fans out and merges; a single-stream lookup refuses.** That split is the shape of the
  signatures rather than a preference. "The ten most recently updated streams" has an answer across a
  hundred files and the ordering key computes it — `fi_streams.timestamp` is `SqliteTimestamp`'s
  fixed-width UTC text, so it compares across databases exactly as within one, and reading `count` from
  each file and keeping the newest `count` is exact rather than approximate. `ReadStreamAsync` and
  `GetStreamMetadataAsync` return **one** answer over an id that is unique *within* a database and not
  across them, so there is no merge to perform and "whichever file we opened" is the bug itself. They
  throw, naming both the tenant-scoped and database-scoped overloads.
- **A fanned-out summary is stamped with its database's tenant, and that is what makes the refusal
  actionable rather than a dead end.** A console lists, then drills in — so the listing has to hand it
  the scope the lookup demands. It cannot come off the row: `StreamsTable` gives `tenant_id` a
  `DEFAULT '*DEFAULT*'` for a store that is not conjoined, so every row in `north.db` reads
  `*DEFAULT*`. The file is the tenant, so `FisherDatabase.TenantId` is what knows.
- ⚠️ **A tenant predicate in SQL is correct only under conjoined tenancy, and the old tenant-scoped
  `ReadStreamAsync` had that backwards.** It composed `and tenant_id = @tenant_id` unconditionally
  against the default file, so under database-per-tenant it matched nothing at all. `ResolveTenantScope`
  is the one place that decides: conjoined means a column predicate, everything else means the tenant
  selects the *database* and adds no `where`. An unknown tenant throws out of `Tenancy.DatabaseFor`
  rather than falling back to the default file, which is the rule every tenant-scoped member follows.
- **The tenant-scoped siblings were asymmetric and are not now.** `ReadStreamAsync` had a tenant
  overload; `GetRecentStreamsAsync` and `GetStreamMetadataAsync` fell through to JasperFx's default,
  which *throws* for a non-null tenant. One of three implemented is the shape the issue's "audit the
  siblings" item exists to catch.
- **`QueryByTagsAsync` and `GetProjectionStatusesAsync` are overridden only to keep the message
  honest.** Fisher answers neither at any scope — the dictionary `QueryByTagsAsync` deliberately (see
  "DCB tags"; `EventQuery.TagValues` is the composable, paged home for it), `GetProjectionStatusesAsync`
  not yet (fisher#243, where the gap is shard *state*, which `fi_event_progression` does not know and
  which reporting as `"Stopped"` — Polecat's answer, polecat#200 — would fake). Left to the interface
  default, a multi-database store would meet jasperfx#810's refusal, which blames the database dimension
  for a read that does not exist at any dimension. Forwarding reaches the accurate "not implemented".
- **Both usage descriptors hardcoded `Cardinality = Single`**, event and document alike. That is the
  fisher#120 shape one field over: a console does not read it as "unknown", it renders a hundred tenants'
  files as a one-file store. `DescribeDatabases()` is the one place both now read, and it fills
  `DatabaseUsage.Databases` too, because an empty list claims there are no tenants.
- **`HasMultipleTenants` said `false` unconditionally**, which was wrong in both directions a Fisher
  store can be multi-tenanted. It now matches Marten's three clauses exactly — non-`Single` cardinality,
  conjoined event tenancy, or any `MultiTenanted()` document type.

**`EventStoreExplorerCompliance` cannot reach any of this**, and says so in its own comments: its
fixture is single-database, so its four database-scoped facts pin that the database overload *agrees
with* the store-global read — vacuously true of a store that ignores the argument.
**`MultiDatabaseExplorerCompliance` (jasperfx#810, 2.69.0) is the shared arm that can**, and Fisher
enrolls both halves of it (fisher#252): `DatabasePerTenantExplorerCompliance` for the store-global
reads, and `ShardedTenancyExplorerCompliance` for the `tenant_id` predicate. Fisher is structurally
well placed for the second — Marten decides whether to apply the predicate from *cardinality*, on the
premise that every stream in a tenant's database is that tenant's, which is true for
database-per-tenant and false for sharding; `ResolveTenantScope` decides from *tenancy style*, which
is the axis that answers the question. `explorer_reads_across_databases`
is the multi-database arm and `explorer_reads_under_conjoined_tenancy` the column-predicate one;
16 of their 19 tests fail against the previous behaviour, and the three that pass are the regression
guards for what a single-database store already did.

⚠️ **`explorer_reads_across_databases` needs its two streams' timestamps to actually differ, and
arranging that is not optional.** `fi_streams.timestamp` is millisecond-precision, two back-to-back
appends land inside one millisecond on a warm machine, and the merge's `OrderByDescending(LastUpdatedAt)`
has no defined tiebreak — so `the_count_bounds_the_merged_listing_and_the_newest_wins` becomes a coin
flip exactly when the suite is fastest. It was caught behaving like one: green alone, red once in the
full class. `WaitForTheClockToMoveAsync` polls **the column's own clock** (`SqliteTimestamp.NowExpression`
over a connection) until it leaves the millisecond, which is `modified_since_and_before`'s lesson again
— a client-sampled bound compares two clocks that are only incidentally the same one, and a fixed sleep
is a wall-clock assumption a loaded host can still lose. Verified by removing it: **three of six runs
fail.**

#### Projection statuses — fisher#243

`IEventStore.GetProjectionStatusesAsync`, in all three scopes, in `DocumentStore.ProjectionStatus.cs`.
The snapshot a monitoring console's projections page renders before it subscribes to
`ShardStatesChanged` for live updates. Fisher answered none of the three until now, and the interface's
default throws — the honest shape, and what fisher#240 deliberately left in place.

**Why #240 left it, and what changed: four of `ShardStatus`'s five fields come off the database
cheaply, and the fifth is not a database fact at all.** `State` describes the *running daemon*, which
`fi_event_progression` does not know. Polecat fills it by reporting every shard as `"Stopped"`
(polecat#200) — which is not a partial answer but a wrong one, because it is exactly what a real
stopped shard reports and it is the reading an operator acts on. Filling the slot that way is the
fisher#120 failure rather than a fix for it, so the read stayed unimplemented until there was somewhere
honest to get the state from.

- **`Unknown` is a distinct value from `Stopped`, and that distinction is the feature.** The state
  comes from the daemon this process hosts, reached through `DocumentStore.RunningDaemons` — fisher#173's
  seam. A store under `DaemonMode.ExternallyManaged`, a console in another process and a hand-built
  store all genuinely cannot see the daemon, and saying so beats a confident guess.
  `a_store_with_no_visible_daemon_reports_unknown_rather_than_stopped` is the load-bearing test;
  replacing `Unknown` with `"Stopped"` fails three.
- **The tracker is reached through `AllDaemonsAsync()`, never `DaemonForDatabase`.** The latter is
  contractually allowed to go looking, and Fisher's implementation *starts daemons* for tenants that
  have appeared since the last poll, then throws when it finds none. Neither belongs in a diagnostics
  read: asking what is running must not change what is running, and "nothing is running here" is an
  answer rather than an error. Matched on `FisherDatabase.Identifier`, the same key
  `FisherDaemonHostedService.TryFindDaemon` uses.
- **`ShardAction` is collapsed onto `ShardStatusState`, the closed four-value vocabulary.** The enum
  records what last *happened*; the field is what the shard *is*, so the four actions a live shard
  publishes — started, updated, restarted, skipped-ahead — become one `Running`. A visible daemon with
  no state for a shard is `Stopped` rather than `Unknown`, because every agent publishes `Started` as
  it launches. **Every arm now lands inside `ShardStatusState.All`** (fisher#249): a faulted shard used
  to answer `"Failed"` and an unrecognised action `Action.ToString()`, both outside the vocabulary — a
  console renders this string and *filters* on it, so a fifth value is a row that matches no filter
  rather than a more precise answer. A faulted shard is one a daemon reached and is no longer running,
  which is `Stopped`; what it faulted on is `Error`, which is why nothing is lost.
- ⚠️ **`EventStoreSequence` is `max(seq_id)`, not the persisted high-water row.** The two are the same
  number on a store whose daemon is current — the mark simply *is* `max(seq_id)` here — and they differ
  exactly when it matters: the row is where the daemon **got to**, so a stopped daemon leaves it behind
  and reporting it would make every shard look caught up. `the_head_is_the_stores_own_rather_than_the_daemons_record_of_it`
  arranges that state deliberately, because on a healthy store the two agree and the test would pass
  either way. Swapping the read fails two tests.
- **An inline or live projection is reported with an empty `Shards` list rather than omitted**, its
  `Lifecycle` saying why. Polecat synthesises a fake single shard for these and puts the *lifecycle
  string* in its `State` slot, which makes that field mean two different things depending on the row.
- ⚠️ **Subscriptions are NOT included, and fisher#249 reversed that.** This answers from
  `Projections.All`, where it used to answer from `AllShards()` — which spans subscriptions too. The
  original argument was real and is why jasperfx#818 needed a ruling rather than a test: a subscription
  genuinely is a daemon shard with progress worth watching, and omitting it makes a store with three
  subscriptions look like a store with none. It went the other way because this is the page an operator
  opens to ask about **read models**, and a subscription has no document behind it — a row for one is
  something a reader cannot click through to. **Nothing is lost**: subscription progress stays reachable
  non-generically through `IEventStore.RegisteredShardNames()` correlated against
  `IEventDatabase.FetchProjectionLagAsync`, the pairing jasperfx#815 built for exactly that question,
  and `a_subscription_is_not_in_the_projection_inventory_and_is_still_reachable` asserts both halves —
  because "dropped from a list" and "no longer answerable" are different outcomes and only the first
  was ruled on.
  - **The registry drives the inventory; the shards are attributed to it.** Joining from that side is
    what drops a subscription from *both* halves of the answer at once — the top-level list and the
    shards inside a status — and the shared suite is shaped to catch the partial fix that filters only
    the outer list.
- **The store-global read refuses on a multi-database store, and for a sharper reason than the stream
  lookups above.** Those return one answer over an id unique within a database; this one *could*
  concatenate, and `Advanced.AllProjectionProgress` does exactly that and documents why. What stops it
  is that `ShardStatus` has no database or tenant field, so N databases' rows arrive as N entries per
  shard with the same `ShardName` and different sequences — unattributable. `ShardState` carries a
  `TenantId`, which is what lets the other method get away with it.
- **A tenant scopes to a database rather than to a predicate**, and here that is what Fisher's shard
  identity *means*: names are `(projection, shard key)` and never `(projection, tenant)`, because
  progression lives in each tenant's file (fisher#57). So under conjoined tenancy a tenant-scoped
  request is the store-global answer — correctly, rather than by accident.
- **A failed head read is swallowed to zero**, the same judgement `TryCreateUsage` makes about the same
  read: the likeliest reason it fails is that the schema does not exist yet, which is precisely when a
  console is most likely to be pointed at the store.

**There is a shared suite now — `ProjectionStatusCompliance` (jasperfx#818) — and it adopted Fisher's
reading of the field this whole section turns on.** `Unknown` means "no daemon here to ask" and is a
different operational situation from `Stopped`; Fisher was the only store reading it that way, and both
siblings change (marten#5383, polecat#589). Fisher passed 8 of 9 on the bump, and the one it failed was
the inventory ruling above.

**`projection_statuses` stays, because the suite cannot see most of what it asserts.** Its fixture
drives one hand-built store and one hosted one; the planted progression row, the deliberately stale
high-water row, and the subscription's survival on the lag surface all need a store arranged into a
state a portable fixture has no vocabulary for. Every decision above was verified by mutation rather
than by inspection.

One requirement of jasperfx#818 was **dropped** rather than adopted, and it is worth knowing which way:
it proposed that an Inline projection report an **empty shard list** — Fisher's answer, and the only
store that gives it. Marten reports `SignalBoard:All / Unknown / 0 / 0`, which is a coherent answer of
a different kind, and Marten's stands. Fisher's empty list is still legal and the suite says nothing
either way. What *is* pinned is that the `State` slot never carries a lifecycle, which is Polecat's
answer and which Fisher already satisfied.

#### What `TryCreateUsage` puts on the wire — fisher#120

`projections list` rendered "No projections in this store." for a store with twenty registered, and
`projections rebuild` matched none of them. The descriptor is where both of those answers come from,
and Fisher never populated `EventStoreUsage.Subscriptions`.

**The fix is one line — `Options.Projections.Describe(usage, this)` — and that is the uncomfortable
part rather than the reassuring one.** Everything it fills was already built: `ProjectionGraph.Describe`
is the shared implementation, and Fisher's two projection source types of its own
(`CompositeIProjectionSource`, `FlatTableProjection`) already implemented `Describe`. Nothing about
the gap was Fisher-specific, which is exactly why it survived — there was no dialect decision to
prompt anybody to look.

**The general rule this establishes: an unfilled slot on `EventStoreUsage` does not read as "this
store does not describe that", it reads as *the store has none*.** Every member is a list or a
nullable that starts empty, so the failure is silent in the one direction that matters — no
exception, no warning, and a console rendering a confident, wrong answer. That is why the whole
descriptor was audited alongside the reported member rather than the one line being added:

- **Both event-type collections.** `Events` and `RegisteredEventTypes` are the same registry twice and
  a consumer may read either. Filling one alone is polecat#411.
- **`TagTypes` and `DcbTagTypes`**, off `EventGraph.TagTypes`. Fisher has DCB; the console had no way
  to know.
- **`ProjectionErrors` and `ProjectionRebuildErrors`** separately, because they differ — a rebuild
  stops on an error a normal run skips, and a console reading one for the other offers "view related
  dead letters" to a store that halts.
- **`EventMetadata`**, whose four event flags are the opt-in `Enable*` options; every *stream* facet
  is universal in Fisher, so those keep the capability defaults.
- **`GlobalAggregates` and `DiscoveredDcbAggregates` stay empty, and that is the correct answer** —
  Fisher registers no aggregate as global and has no `IDcbAggregateRegistry`. Worth saying, because
  under the rule above an empty list is a claim rather than an omission.

**`MaxEventSequence` is the one entry that means something different here than on either sibling.** It
is the physical `max(seq_id)`, and the gap between it and the high-water mark is what CritterWatch#150's
second signal renders. **On Fisher there can never be a gap** — one writer per file plus
`BEGIN IMMEDIATE` makes committed sequences contiguous, which is the same fact that lets
`FisherHighWaterDetector` skip gap detection entirely. So the signal cannot fire, and reporting the
number is what lets a console establish that; leaving it null renders as "n/a" and says nothing.

Two decisions in how it is read:

- **A failed read costs the number, not the description.** The likeliest reason it fails is that the
  schema does not exist yet, which is precisely when a monitoring tool is most likely to be pointed at
  the store. `a_store_with_no_schema_still_describes_itself` pins that the method stays useful there.
- **`Describe` is called last, as Polecat calls it.** It registers each subscription's included event
  types on the event graph as a side effect, so calling it earlier would let those types into
  `usage.Events` and make a diagnostics call's output depend on whether anything had asked before.

**The shared suite cannot catch this class of gap for any store**, which is worth knowing before
assuming compliance covers the descriptor: `EventStoreExplorerCompliance` asserts on `usage.Events`
alone and returns early when the usage is null. `event_store_usage` is Fisher's own until that grows a
sibling, and it asserts presence rather than shape for the reason above — all nine of its tests fail
against the shipped 1.0.2 behaviour.

### LINQ

Ported from Polecat, which owns `Polecat.Linq.SqlGeneration` itself rather than taking it from
`Weasel.SqlServer` — so Fisher carrying its own fragment set is the mirror, not a divergence, and no
upstream Weasel change was needed. The fragments bind to `Weasel.Core.SqlGeneration.ISqlFragment`
(the neutral one the storage layer already uses) rather than a Fisher-local copy, so a parsed
predicate can be handed to `FisherDocumentStorage.FilterDocuments`.

`session.Query<T>()` supports `Where`, the four ordering operators, `Take`/`Skip`, and async
terminals. Anything else throws `BadLinqExpressionException` naming the operator rather than falling
back to client-side evaluation.

The port is **smaller** than its source. `json_extract` returns a JSON number as INTEGER, a float as
REAL, a string as TEXT and `true`/`false` as INTEGER 1/0 — unlike `JSON_VALUE`, which always returns
`nvarchar`. So there is no `CAST` anywhere, and Polecat's `SqlTypeMap` / `BuildTypedLocator` /
`SupportsReturning` machinery has no analogue; `TypedLocator` and `RawLocator` are the same string for
every member except a timestamp, which is the one case that needs wrapping.

Six SQLite decisions that are easy to get wrong and fail silently:

- **String predicates use `instr`/`substr`, not `LIKE`.** SQLite's `LIKE` is case-*insensitive* for
  ASCII while `=` is case-*sensitive*, so a LIKE-based `Contains("frodo")` matches `"Frodo"` on data
  where `== "frodo"` does not — a query surface contradicting itself, and not what .NET's ordinal
  `string.Contains` means. `_` and `%` are also `LIKE` wildcards needing an `ESCAPE` clause (Polecat's
  `[_]` bracket form is T-SQL-only) — the same trap as the document cleaner's table matching.
- **Paging is `limit m offset n`.** `TOP(n)` and `OFFSET … FETCH NEXT` collapse to one form; T-SQL's
  `ORDER BY (SELECT NULL)` filler is not emitted because SQLite does not need it and it would impose a
  sort nobody asked for. An offset with no limit must say `limit -1` first — a bare `offset` is a
  parse error.
- **A timestamp is compared through SQLite's date parser, not against the raw JSON.**
  `TimestampMember.TypedLocator` is `strftime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%f', json_extract(...))`, which folds the
  trailing offset into UTC and renders fixed-width to the millisecond. Without it the comparison is
  against the text System.Text.Json wrote, and that is not order-preserving twice over: trailing
  fractional zeros are trimmed, and the original offset is kept, so `12:34:56-05:00` sorts before
  `12:34:56.789+00:00` while being five hours later. **Equality goes through the same normalisation as
  ordering** — two spellings of one instant must not be equal for `>=` and unequal for `==` — which
  costs sub-millisecond discrimination on `==`, as it does on the siblings (`timestamptz` is microsecond
  precision). `RawLocator` stays bare, because a null test asks whether the member is present, not
  whether it parses. **`DateOnly` and `TimeOnly` need none of this** and stay on `DateMember`: a
  `DateOnly` is fixed-width with no offset and no fraction, and a `TimeOnly`'s optional fraction is a
  strict suffix, so trimming shortens the string without changing which of two values compares smaller.
  This is documents only — the `fi_events`/`fi_streams` timestamp columns use `SqliteTimestamp`'s
  fixed-width UTC format precisely so they *do* sort as text. Making the result *indexable* is a
  separate concern (fisher#2), and `strftime` over `json_extract` being computed per row is what makes
  it worth having.
- **`AllowsRangeComparison` is still false for one member: a string-stored enum.** Under
  `EnumStorage.AsString` the stored value is the member's *name*, so ordering by it sorts alphabetically
  rather than by the enum's declared order — `HighDistinction` before `Pass`, whatever the values say.
  Both the where parser and `OrderBy` refuse rather than answer wrongly, naming `EnumStorage` in the
  message. Fisher's default is `AsInteger`, where `json_extract` yields a number that orders correctly
  with no help. That property survives fisher#1 precisely because this case exists; it is the seam for
  "correct for equality, meaningless when ordered", not a date-specific flag.
- **`array.Contains(x)` binds to `MemoryExtensions.Contains(ReadOnlySpan<T>, T)`**, not
  `Enumerable.Contains`, so `EnumerableContains` matches on the call's shape rather than its declaring
  type. The span operand cannot be evaluated by compiling a lambda either — `ReadOnlySpan<T>` is a ref
  struct and cannot be returned as `object` — so it is unwrapped back to the array first.
- **A `decimal` comparison value is normalised to `double` at the point it is bound** (fisher#304).
  Microsoft.Data.Sqlite binds a raw `decimal` as TEXT and `json_extract` yields REAL for a JSON
  number; SQLite orders every numeric value below every TEXT one, so `>` and `==` matched **nothing**
  and `<` matched **everything** — no exception, and a plausible result set in both directions. Money
  is the overwhelmingly common `decimal`, so `Where(x => x.Total > limit)` silently returning nothing
  is the dangerous half.
  - **The conversion is in `ComparisonFilter` and `WhereInFilter` rather than in
    `QueryableMember.ConvertValue`, and that placement IS the fix.** Four producers build a comparison
    — the member seam, the method-transform locator, the arithmetic locator and `GroupProjection`'s
    `HAVING` — and only the first has a member to ask, so a conversion made in the member would have
    left the other three wrong. Same rule fisher#51 and fisher#17 record for the implicit filters: a
    per-caller conversion is one the next caller forgets. `SqliteParameterValue.NormalizeDecimal` is
    the one named rule; `ModuloFilter` had carried a private copy of it since fisher#161 and now calls
    it too.
  - **A *duplicated* decimal compares correctly either way**, because the generated column is declared
    REAL and the column's affinity coerces a TEXT-bound parameter — there is no affinity inside
    `json_extract`, which is why the undeclared member is the broken case and the declared one is not.
    Pinned by `a_duplicated_decimal_column_compares_as_a_number` so a reader does not mistake the
    asymmetry for a flaw in the fix.
  - **Ordering was never affected** — it binds no value at all — and the raw-SQL twin has been right
    since fisher#34 (`SqliteParameterValue`, which documents this exact conversion). Two of Fisher's
    three decimal-binding paths were correct and documented while the one a caller reaches first was
    not; that is the shape rather than the exception.

The provider takes both the column list and the materializer from the **query-only** closed-shape
storage (`ISelectClause.SelectFields()` / `BuildSelector()`) rather than hand-writing `select data`,
which is what keeps the query path's read layout aligned with `LoadAsync`'s.

### Bulk insert

`Advanced.BulkInsertAsync` (fisher#36). **There is no `SqlBulkCopy` to reach for and none is needed**:
on SQLite the cost of an insert is dominated by the transaction rather than by the statement, so a
prepared statement re-executed with rebound parameters inside one transaction is already the fast path.
The statements are the ones `SqliteDocumentStorageDescriptorBuilder` already builds, reached through a
session — a second set of write SQL is exactly where the positional `?` contract would drift apart
unnoticed.

- **`batchSize` is a ceiling on how long the write lock is held, not a throughput knob.** One writer
  per file means a single transaction over a very large set blocks every other writer for its whole
  duration. The trade is that **bulk insert is not atomic across batches** — a failure part way leaves
  earlier batches committed, which `a_failure_part_way_leaves_earlier_batches_committed` pins so it
  reads as a decision rather than being discovered.
- **`IgnoreDuplicates` filters, where both siblings use a statement** (fisher#53). Marten has
  `on conflict do nothing` and Polecat a temp table and a `MERGE`; Fisher's four write statements are
  consumed by Weasel's shared closed-shape operations *by name*, so a fifth would need a slot on
  Weasel's own `DocumentStorageDescriptor`. Each batch instead reads which of its ids are already
  stored and queues only the rest. Three things in that read:
  - **It deliberately ignores the soft-delete and hierarchy filters** an ordinary load applies. The
    question is not "can I read this" but "would inserting this collide", and a soft-deleted row still
    holds the primary key — which is why it is hand-built rather than routed through `LoadManyAsync`
    or `Query<T>()`, the one place in the LINQ-adjacent code that going around them is correct. It
    *does* scope by tenant, because a conjoined table keys on `(tenant_id, id)`. Adding the
    soft-delete term makes `a_soft_deleted_row_is_still_a_duplicate` fail with `UNIQUE constraint
    failed`, which was verified.
  - **Both sides compare as invariant strings.** Microsoft.Data.Sqlite hands an INTEGER column back as
    `long` while an `int` identity's raw value is an `int`, and boxed to `object` those never compare
    equal — so an int-keyed type finds nothing and fails on the constraint the mode exists to avoid.
    `ignore_duplicates_over_an_integer_identity` fails with exactly that without the normalisation.
  - **The probe is outside the write transaction, and the window is not silent.** A concurrent writer
    inserting one of the same ids in between makes the insert fail with its unique-constraint
    violation rather than being skipped. Closing it would mean holding `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` across the
    probe through an enlisted session, which forfeits the `SQLITE_BUSY` retry — a worse trade for the
    operation most likely to contend for the write lock.

### Patching

`session.Patch<T>(id)` / `Patch<T>(predicate)` (fisher#35) — changing part of a stored document
without loading it. Every operation is one json1 function inside a single
`update … set data = …`, and a chain nests into one statement.

**This is the strongest single case for SQLite in the backlog.** No server function to install (Marten
needs a PL/pgSQL patch function), no `JSON_MODIFY` shape differences, and it composes. And **a
duplicated field follows a patch with nothing to refresh**, because fisher#2 made duplicated fields
`VIRTUAL` generated columns over `data` — both siblings must update theirs inside the patch SQL. That
is the clearest dividend of that decision.

**What a patch costs, said plainly:** `json_set` re-renders the document, so a patched row is no longer
byte-identical to what the serializer would have written and a new or renamed key lands at the end. It
avoids the deserialize/mutate/serialize round trip, *not* the row rewrite. Do not let "patching avoids
the round trip" imply "patching is cheap" — and note it breaks the byte-exactness fisher#28 promises.

- **Values go in through the store's serializer, not `SqliteParameterValue`.** fisher#34's conversions
  exist to match *columns*; a patched value lands inside `data`, so it must match what a full write
  would have produced — a timestamp in System.Text.Json's format rather than `SqliteTimestamp`'s.
  Wrapping in `json(?)` then makes a string a JSON string, a number a JSON number and an object a JSON
  object with no per-type branching.
- **`Increment` needs `coalesce(…, 0)`.** `json_extract` of an absent *or null* key is SQL NULL and
  `NULL + n` is NULL, so without it the member silently becomes null instead of the increment.
  `increment_an_absent_member` uses an `int?` member deliberately: a non-nullable `int` serializes as 0
  rather than being absent, and the first version of that test passed with and without the coalesce.
- **Steps that read what they change read the accumulated expression**, not the bare `data` column, so
  a chain sees its own earlier work. The cost is that the text grows with the chain.
- **The value placeholders are indexed.** `ICommandBuilder.AppendParameter` writes its marker into the
  SQL *at the point it is called*, so the expression cannot bind while composing — it would put `@p0`
  in front of `update`. It is built with placeholders and split at render time; the index rather than a
  bare marker is needed because `AppendIfNotExists` embeds the accumulated expression twice, and a
  positional placeholder would be counted twice over.
- **The version and timestamp columns are assigned explicitly.** They are not in the JSON, so nothing
  about the json1 expression moves them — and without it an optimistic-concurrency type would silently
  stop seeing patched writes and `ModifiedSince` would miss them.
- **A patch does not reach a soft-deleted row**, the same rule the load SQL and the LINQ default filter
  follow. Verified by removing the guard.
- **The by-name overloads take the *stored* key**, not a CLR member name — `"name"`, not `"Name"`. That
  is the point of them: reaching a key the type no longer has a member for, which is exactly what
  `Rename` is for. They are deliberately not routed through `MemberFactory`, which would refuse the
  case they exist for.
- **`Insert` at an index rebuilds the array** (fisher#52). `json_insert` only inserts where the path
  does not exist, so at an occupied index it is a silent no-op, and `json_replace` overwrites rather
  than shifting. The rebuild does not lean on `json_each`'s row order, which is not a documented
  guarantee: it computes an explicit ordinal from `json_each.key` and orders by it — an existing
  element keeps `2k` below the insertion point and takes `2k+2` at or above it, and the new element is
  `2*index+1`, so it lands strictly between two neighbours. An index past the end sorts above
  everything and therefore appends, which is why that case needs no length to check.
- **The rebuilt element must be keyed on `json_each.type`, not on its value**, and this is where the
  original `Remove` was wrong twice. SQLite has no boolean, so a JSON `true` arrives as the integer 1
  and `json_quote` writes it back as `1` — every rebuild silently turned an array's booleans into
  numbers. And a JSON `null` element reads back as SQL NULL, so `Remove`'s `where value <> ?` was NULL
  rather than true for it and **every removal dropped every null in the array**. `ElementSql` and an
  `is not` comparison fix both; `the_rebuild_keeps_booleans_and_nulls` covers them, and each half was
  verified by reverting it.
- **json1's JSON subtype does not survive a subquery.** `Insert` projects its elements through one, so
  `json_group_array(v)` writes every element as a quoted string; the aggregate has to re-parse with
  `json_group_array(json(v))`. `Remove` never meets this because its rebuild is a single flat select.

### JSON-returning reads

`LoadJsonAsync`, `ToJsonArrayAsync`, `ToJsonFirstWithVersionAsync` and `StreamJsonArrayAsync`
(fisher#28). They skip the deserialize-then-reserialize round trip when the caller is going to write
the document to a response anyway.

**The saving is larger here than on either sibling**, and the reason is structural: on Marten and
Polecat it saves CPU for data that already crossed a network from a database server; in Fisher the
database *is* the caller's process, so the round trip is the whole cost rather than a fraction.

- **`data` is TEXT holding exactly what System.Text.Json wrote**, so the read is byte-exact.
  PostgreSQL's `jsonb` normalises whitespace and key order and SQL Server's `nvarchar` needs an
  encoding decision — neither sibling can promise this, and `load_json_is_byte_exact_against_what_the_serializer_wrote`
  pins it against the serializer's own output rather than a hand-written literal.
- **Concatenated in .NET, not with `json_group_array`.** That function re-parses and re-renders every
  document — discarding the whole saving and reordering object keys on the way.
- **Every one goes through the ordinary statement path**, so the tenant, soft-delete and hierarchy
  filters apply without being restated. A JSON read composing its own `select data from …` would be
  one more caller having to remember all three, which is how fisher#51 happened.
- **`ToJsonFirstWithVersionAsync` asks for `guid_version` explicitly** — a query-only read normally
  drops it, having no version tracker to feed — and is refused for a type without optimistic
  concurrency, since the column does not exist. Named plainly rather than surfacing as
  `no such column`.
- **`StreamJsonArrayAsync` materializes before writing, deliberately.** A retried `SQLITE_BUSY`
  re-executes the whole delegate, so streaming a live reader to the caller's stream would resume
  against a disposed reader *and* a half-written response body. This is the one place the retry
  semantics and the streaming goal genuinely conflict; buffering is the resolution, because the saving
  being chased is the serializer round trip rather than the buffer.

### Batched queries, query plans, `CheckExistsAsync` and `ToSql`

fisher#37 widened the DCB-only batch into a general one and moved it from `Fisher.Events.Tags` to
`Fisher.Batching`, since it is no longer tag-specific. **fisher#201 finished the move by putting the
entry point where Marten and Polecat have it** — `IQuerySession.CreateBatchQuery()`, implemented on
`FisherSession`, with `session.Events.CreateBatchQuery()` kept as a forwarder. It stayed on `Events`
for a release because that is where it was *born*, naming the narrowest of its uses, and the cost was
that ported Marten code batching *document* reads did not compile. The compliance fixture's two
`(IDocumentSession)` casts are gone with it, which is the smoke test that it landed where the shared
seam needed it. `both_spellings_build_the_same_batch` asserts equivalence rather than existence: a
forwarder handing back a batch built against a different session would satisfy "the member is still
there" and then read the wrong tenant's rows. **The framing in its doc comment still stands
and should not be softened**: a batch elsewhere collapses network round trips, SQLite is embedded, and
there are none to collapse. It exists so DCB and document code ports between the stores unchanged. The
one property that does hold is ordering — the reads run back to back on one connection with nothing
interleaved.

- **A failing item neither stops the batch nor vanishes.** Every item runs, each task is completed or
  faulted, and `Execute` then throws for what failed. Both halves are load-bearing: stopping at the
  first failure leaves later items' tasks uncompleted, so a caller awaiting one *hangs* rather than
  seeing an error; faulting only the item's task lets a caller who never awaits that particular item
  conclude the batch succeeded. One failure rethrows as itself, several become an
  `AggregateException` — the same rule the session's batch executor follows.
- **`CheckExistsAsync` routes through the LINQ path**, not through a hand-written
  `select 1 from … where id = ?`. That is what makes it carry the tenant filter, the soft-delete filter
  and a hierarchy discriminator without restating any of them — it is a fourth caller that would
  otherwise have to remember all three, which is exactly how fisher#51 happened.
- **`ToSql` renders parameter names, not values**, so the text is readable rather than executable. It
  is the cheapest way to assert that an implicit filter is actually present, which is what
  `to_sql_shows_the_filters_fisher_adds` uses it for.
- `QueryListPlan<T>` implements both `IQueryPlan` and `IBatchQueryPlan` from one `Query` method, which
  is what keeps the batched and unbatched paths from drifting into two different queries with one name.

### Binary event bodies

`JasperFx.Events.BinaryEventAttribute`, `StoreOptions.Events.DefaultBinarySerializer` and
`StoreOptions.Events.UseBinarySerializer<TEvent>(…)` (fisher#43, reshaped by fisher#93) — an event
body stored as a BLOB in `fi_events.data_binary` rather than as JSON text in `data`.

⚠️ **The interface and the attribute live in `JasperFx.Events`, not in Fisher.** fisher#43 declared
Fisher-native copies; jasperfx#669 promoted the pair into the core in 2.50.0 and fisher#93 deleted
Fisher's, so one serializer implementation serves Fisher, Marten and Polecat. The core signature is
`Serialize(Type type, object data)` / `Deserialize(Type type, byte[] data)` — **argument order
reversed** from Fisher's old one, which is a silent break for an implementation that used positional
names, so it is a compile error only because the parameter *types* also swap. Do not re-add a
Fisher-local copy: two `BinaryEventAttribute`s in scope is CS0104 in every file importing both
namespaces.

**Worth more here than the same feature is on Marten**, and for a structural reason: Fisher is
embedded, so the store's disk footprint *is* the application's, and SQLite has no `jsonb` — where
PostgreSQL keeps a compact binary form for free, Fisher stores the literal JSON text of every event
forever, property names included.

- **A separate nullable BLOB column, not BLOBs mixed into `data`.** SQLite would tolerate the mixture,
  since affinity is a preference rather than a constraint — but then `typeof(data)` is the only way to
  tell an encoding apart, and `json_extract` over the column silently stops meaning anything for the
  rows that are binary. One nullable column per row buys an unambiguous shape.
- ⚠️ **`data_binary` is UNCONDITIONAL, and `data` keeps its NOT NULL constraint** — fisher#93 reversed
  both halves of fisher#43's gate, and the reversal is the point of the issue rather than a tidy-up. A
  binary row writes the placeholder `EventsTable.JsonPlaceholder` (`{}`) into `data`. Two consequences,
  both load-bearing: an existing store upgrades with a plain `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN` instead of the
  table rebuild SQLite demands to relax a NOT NULL, and there is no longer a schema decision to take
  before the store is created. Appending a `[BinaryEvent]` type with no serializer configured is still
  refused by name — it is a configuration error, not a silent reversion to JSON.
- **`data_binary` is composed last in the SELECT and gets the last `MetadataSlots` ordinal**, so every
  ordinal above it is unmoved whether or not the store has one. Same reason fisher#29's session
  metadata binders were appended rather than inserted.
- ⚠️ **Which column a row's body is in is decided PER ROW, on `data_binary IS NULL` — never off the
  event type.** fisher#43 dispatched on the type and fisher#93 reversed that too. It is what makes
  marking a type `[BinaryEvent]` an in-place change on a live file: rows written before the change are
  still JSON and still read. A type-based dispatch sends every one of them down the binary path, where
  a null BLOB is either an exception or an event with every member at its default — silent, since the
  row and the stream are otherwise intact. `turning_a_type_binary_on_an_existing_file_needs_no_migration`
  pins it, as does the shared `BinaryEventSerializationCompliance`.
- ⚠️ **The BLOB is bound as a `byte[]` parameter, never routed through a text encoding.** Arbitrary
  bytes — gzip output, MessagePack — are exactly what a text round trip corrupts, and nothing else is.
  The compliance suite's serializer gzips deliberately for this reason.
- ⚠️ **The column list and the bind order are one contract, and fisher#43 broke it.** `data_binary` was
  named ninth in the INSERT while being bound last, so a store with any of the four `Enable*` metadata
  columns on wrote a binary event's BLOB into `correlation_id`. Nothing caught it: the binary tests
  enabled no metadata and the metadata tests appended no binary event. It is last in both now.
- **Both rewrite operations refuse a binary event by name, and that was the likeliest way this feature
  could corrupt data.** They write the JSON `data` column; against a binary row that leaves a JSON body
  *and* a BLOB body, and every reader resolves by event type — so the JSON would be invisible and the
  row quietly wrong. `QueryEventDataAsync<T>` (fisher#41) refuses one too, because `data` holds only the
  placeholder for those rows: it would match nothing and report that as an answer.
- **Compacting works and clears the BLOB.** The snapshot it writes is a JSON `Compacted<T>`, so the
  replace is permitted; `ReplaceEventOperation` nulls `data_binary` as well, or the row keeps a body no
  reader will ever look at.
- **Fisher ships no `IEventBinarySerializer`, and that is the end state** — the position `IMessageOutbox`
  holds. A binary encoding is a choice with real consequences for schema evolution (MessagePack,
  protobuf and compressed JSON fail differently when an event type gains a member), and picking one
  would be Fisher deciding how an application's data ages.

Everything that reads the row's *columns* is unaffected — stream reads, the daemon's loader, DCB tag
queries, `QueryEventsAsync`'s metadata filters — which is why a stream can mix the two encodings
freely, and why the daemon needed no change at all.

### Event upcasting

`StoreOptions.Events.Upcasters` (fisher#191) — how an old stored event schema is reinterpreted as the
current CLR event type on every read path. **The registry, the transformation shape and the
`IEventUpcaster` bases are all JasperFx's** (`JasperFx.Events.Upcasting`, jasperfx#752); Fisher
supplies the read path and one `IUpcastPayload` adapter, the same division as the async daemon.

The whole read-side integration is **one call in `FisherEventsRowReader.ReadEventCore`**, which is
what having a single hydration point buys — every stream read, live aggregation, `FetchForWriting`,
DCB tag query and daemon page already converges there.

- ⚠️ **The registry is consulted BEFORE `ResolveEventType`, and that ordering is the marten#4680
  authority rule** rather than an optimisation. A registered transformation is the authoritative
  interpretation of its source event type name, so the stored `dotnet_type` hint does not get a vote.
  The case it exists for is a store that still has the old CLR type in its codebase: a typed append
  of it writes both the source name and a hint pointing at the old type, and letting the hint win
  would read *those* rows as the old schema while every row the previous deployment wrote upcast
  correctly — one store, one event type name, two answers.
- ⚠️ **Hydration became asynchronous for this** (`ValueTask<IEvent?>` throughout). The shared contract
  lets a transformation be registered async-only, whose synchronous delegate throws by design — so a
  store hydrating synchronously could not honour one at all. Every Fisher read path was already
  inside an `await reader.ReadAsync(...)` loop, so the cost is a `ValueTask` per row, and the ordinary
  path awaits nothing and completes synchronously. `TryUpcast` is guarded on `Upcasters.HasAny`
  first, so a store with no upcasts pays one boolean field read per row.
- **`FisherUpcastPayload` is a `readonly struct`**, per-row and never cached, which is what the
  contract expects — a transformation calls exactly one accessor exactly once. The ordinary path never
  constructs one.
- **The raw-`JsonDocument` accessor is unconditional here**, where the contract permits a store to
  refuse: Fisher is System.Text.Json-only and `data` holds exactly the text it wrote. Marten's is
  optional because its serializer is configurable. **A binary body (fisher#93) is the one exception** —
  its `data` column holds only the `{}` placeholder, so a raw-JSON transformation over one is refused
  by name rather than handed an empty object, which would upcast to an event with every member at its
  default. A *typed* transformation reads it through the old type's own `IEventBinarySerializer`.
- ⚠️ **The daemon's server-side type filter is widened with every transformation's SOURCE name**, or a
  shard filtered on the new types reads nothing at all from the history it was pointed at — silently,
  reporting itself caught up. The filter is pushed into SQLite precisely so non-matching rows never
  leave it, which is why the loader's in-memory check (which does see the hydrated, upcast event)
  cannot rescue it. **`UpcastingCompliance` does not reach this**: its daemon fact registers a
  snapshot projection, whose `IncludedEventTypes` allow list is empty, so no SQL filter is composed
  at all. `upcasting.a_subscription_filtered_on_the_new_type_receives_the_upcast_old_rows` is what
  pins it, and it fails by delivering nothing when the widening is removed.
- **The target event types are pre-registered in `DocumentStore`'s constructor**, from
  `Upcasters.AllTransformations`. Nothing else would: dropping the old type is the point of an
  upcast, so no `AddEventType`, projection registration or append ever mentions the new type either.
  Done at construction rather than at registration because a transformation may be registered through
  the shared JasperFx surface, which Fisher owns no hook in.
- **The envelope keeps the row's stored `type` and `dotnet_type`**, not the transformation's. It is a
  claim about the row, and nothing dispatches on it — `IEvent.EventType` is `Event<T>`'s `T`, which is
  the new type.
- **Upcasting does not reach a projection that has already run.** The high-water mark is a sequence
  and registering a transformation does not move it, so a document built from the old schema keeps
  what it derived until that projection is rebuilt. Same caveat as masking, and the same reason.

`UpcastingCompliance` is the definition, and it is **the first suite in the library written ahead of
any store implementing the behaviour** — its gate ships closed and Fisher is the first to flip it, so
all seven facts ran for the first time anywhere here. Enrolling it found one suite bug: its
raw-JSON fact reached the stored body with a case-sensitive `GetProperty("CartId")`, which is
Marten's default casing and not Polecat's or Fisher's — fixed upstream in jasperfx#787.
`Events/upcasting.cs` covers the two things the suite structurally cannot see: the server-side filter
above, and binary bodies, which the shared upcasting fixture knows nothing about.

### Querying event bodies

`EventOperations.QueryEventDataAsync<T>(predicate)` (fisher#41) — the counterpart to
`QueryEventsAsync`, which queries an event's *metadata*. That method's doc comment says a body member
is unreachable "because the body is JSON of a type the row only names". **That is true of `IEvent` in
general and false once the caller names the type**, which is the whole of this feature.

**It needed no new SQL machinery.** An event body is a JSON document in a TEXT column called `data` —
structurally identical to a document — so `MemberFactory`'s locators apply verbatim against
`fi_events`, including fisher#1's `strftime` wrapper for a timestamp inside a body.

- **There is no `DocumentMapping` involved, and that is not laziness.** Most event types have no
  identity member and `DocumentMapping` refuses a type without one; and asking for a mapping would
  *register* the event type as a document, giving it a table in the next migration.
  `MemberFactory` therefore has a mapping-free constructor — the mapping is only ever consulted for
  the identity member and for duplicated fields, and an event body has neither.
- **A body member called `Id` must not resolve to `fi_events.id`.** That column is the *event's*
  identity, so resolving to it would compare against the wrong column and return rows rather than an
  error. `a_body_member_called_id_is_not_the_events_own_id` pins it.
- **The type filter is `type`, the alias — not `dotnet_type`.** Short and stable where the other is
  assembly-qualified and brittle across a rename; the same reasoning as fisher#17's `doc_type`.
- **It is a scan**, and honestly so: there is no index over `fi_events.data`. fisher#16's expression
  indexes are the mechanism if one ever needs to be fast, and they would apply here unchanged.

### DCB tags

One `fi_event_tag_<suffix>` table per registered tag type, composite primary key leading with
`value`. That key is load-bearing twice over: a tag query filters on `value`, so leading with it makes
the lookup a range scan; and it is what lets both the append path and `AssignTagWhere` write
`on conflict do nothing` instead of reading first, which is where idempotency comes from.

**Tags are written after the batch and inside its transaction** (`FisherSession.SaveChangesAsync` →
`EventTagWriter`). A tag row is keyed by the `seq_id` SQLite assigns on insert, which Fisher only
learns from the trailing sequence read-back in `FisherQuickAppendEventsOperation` — so there is
nothing to write until the appends postprocess. Committing separately would leave an event visible
but untagged, and to a tag query that is indistinguishable from an event that was never tagged.

Query shape: each condition is a `seq_id in (select seq_id from <tag table> where value = ?)`
subselect, OR'd. **Subselects rather than joins**, because joining several tag tables multiplies rows
when one event carries two matching tags and the caller expects each event once. Ordering is by
`seq_id`, since a tag query spans streams and version is not a global order — which is also why
`FisherEventsRowReader.ReadEventAcrossStreams` exists, taking stream identity from the row rather
than from the hydration context the single-stream reads use.

Guid tag values bind as lowercase canonical text, same trap as `SqliteGuidIdentification`.

**A boundary aggregate needs no single-stream identity** (fisher#135). `AggregateIdentity.ResolveIdType`
treats `JasperFx.Events.Aggregation.BoundaryAggregateAttribute` as an explicit opt-out and answers
`typeof(string)` — the vestigial `TId` the source generator already keys a marked identity-less type's
evolver on, so it is the only answer that finds the dispatcher.

**Fisher is the first store to actually honour it, which is not what fisher#135 assumed.** The issue
filed this as a Fisher-only divergence on the strength of Polecat's DCB page, which documents the
marker as the answer across the stack. Polecat's *source* has no mention of it: its
`IAggregationSourceFactory.Build<TDoc>()` resolves identity through `DocumentMapping`, whose
constructor throws for a type with no `Id`. Verified by running it rather than by reading — a
`[BoundaryAggregate]` aggregate with no identity failed there with *"must have a public property named
'Id'"*, from `DocumentMapping..ctor`. So the divergence closed here was between Fisher and the
attribute's documented contract rather than against a sibling's behaviour. **Polecat has since
followed** — polecat#521 shipped in Polecat 5.21.0, one day after Fisher 1.0.5 — so the marker now
means the same thing on both, and the docs caveat that said otherwise is gone. **The shared suite catches
neither, because every DCB aggregate in it happens to carry an identity** — jasperfx#718 is the request
to add an identity-less one, which has to fold *with events present* or it passes on a broken store.

- **The marker is the whole exemption, and the message names it.** An unmarked identity-less aggregate
  is still refused, because it is far more often a forgotten `Id` than a deliberate boundary aggregate
  — the same reason the generator emits nothing for one. What changed beside the exemption is that the
  refusal now mentions `[BoundaryAggregate]`, since the old text ("single stream aggregates need an
  `Id`") was accurate for the aggregate it was written about and misleading for this one.
- **Not inherited.** The generator reads the attribute off the declaring type in its own compilation,
  so a subclass inheriting the marker here would resolve to `string` and then fail to find a dispatcher
  of its own.
- **The empty boundary is why this bites late, and why the coverage has to have events.**
  `FetchForWritingByTags` folds only when the query finds something, so a boundary over an empty result
  — the ordinary "this must not exist yet" assertion — succeeded before this was honoured. A suite
  exercising only that path is green over a model that throws on first real use.
  `boundary_aggregates.fetch_for_writing_by_tags_folds_an_identity_less_aggregate` is the discriminating
  test; `concurrent_boundary_appends` dropped the unused `Id` it carried as the workaround.

**`AssignTagWhere` is a client of the LINQ `WhereClauseParser`**, as Marten builds it. The only piece
it needed was `EventMemberFactory`, an `IMemberResolver` resolving `IEvent` members to `fi_events`
columns instead of `json_extract` paths — which is why `IMemberResolver` is an interface rather than
a concrete type. Note `IEvent.Timestamp` permits range comparison where a document's
`DateTimeOffset` does not: same CLR type, but `fi_events.timestamp` is `SqliteTimestamp`'s
fixed-width UTC format, chosen precisely so a string comparison is an instant comparison.

**The consistency check runs inside the write transaction, before anything is written.** Checking
after would be checking against the session's own appends; checking outside the transaction would
prove nothing, because `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` is what holds the write lock. A boundary over an empty
result still enforces consistency — `LastSeenSequence` is 0 and any later matching event exceeds it.

`IBatchedQuery` matches the siblings' shape but exists **for API parity, not for speed** — a batch
elsewhere collapses network round trips, and SQLite is embedded, so there are none to collapse. It is
carried so DCB code ports between stores unchanged and so Fisher enrolls in the shared batched-query
tests with a real implementation rather than a test-only shim; `DcbTagQueryAndConsistencyCompliance`
has no opt-out flag, so declining would have cost all 26 of its tests. Implemented without statement
coalescing on purpose. Do not present it as a performance feature.

### Compliance suites

**Fisher enrolls every suite `JasperFx.Events.ComplianceTests` ships but one**, and
`SingleTenantedEventSlicingCompliance` is the exception, for a precondition reason set out in the
enrollment file. `JasperFx.Events.ComplianceTests` is referenced unconditionally — the old
`$(EnableComplianceTests)` gate is gone.

**The counts live in HANDOFF.md and deliberately not here.** They were repeated in this file until they
went stale in the usual way: it claimed "55 of the 56 suites 2.70.0 ships — 572 tests" while HANDOFF
two bumps later said 56 and 583, and nothing recomputed either. HANDOFF is the scoreboard and is
machine-checked against a real run by `scripts/check_scoreboard.py`, which covers the three files that
carry those numbers on purpose; a fourth copy is a fourth thing to rot. What follows here is the
history and the mechanics.

### Wave 13 — the first suites to run anywhere (fisher#184)

**2.64.0's eight new event suites had never been executed against a real event store.** The JasperFx
repository enrols only the document suites, so the whole wave arrived compile-checked and
design-reasoned. That makes Fisher's enrollment first-contact runtime validation, and it changes how
a red fact should be read: as likely an over-tight assertion as a store bug. Nineteen were red on the
first run and every one was classified — five genuine Fisher bugs (all fixed), two upstream bugs
(jasperfx#778 product, jasperfx#779 suite; both fixed upstream, and #779 is already released), three
suites gated off for a LINQ surface Fisher does not have, one suite deferred to the upcasting node.

**jasperfx#778 is the one worth knowing**, because it is the shape a store-side reader would not
suspect: an `Archived` event the aggregate applies nothing for did not archive its stream, on any
store. `Archived` carries no state, so an aggregate has no reason to declare an `Apply` for it, which
left it out of the projection's `AllEventTypes` — and `ApplyInline`'s opening
`streams.Where(AppliesTo(...))` then screened the whole stream out before reading anything. Marten's
own archiving tests all append a handled event beside the marker, which is why it survived until a
store ran the suite. Two facts stay red on Fisher until the fix ships; see HANDOFF.md.

The five Fisher bugs are worth knowing as a set, because they share a shape — a member that looked
right, that nothing local had a reason to question:

- **`AlwaysEnforceConsistency` did nothing.** See "Session metadata on appended events" and the
  append planner: `CollectActionableStreams` kept only streams with at least one event, so the flag's
  entire subject — a stream fetched, flagged, and then left alone — was dropped along with its guard.
- **Appending to an archived stream landed.** Now `Exceptions.ArchivedStreamException`, raised from
  `AppendPlanner.PlanStream` — and deliberately not for a `StartStream`, where an archived id is
  still an id in use and the collision is the more useful answer.
- **`FisherProjectionStorage.ArchiveStream` was empty**, with a comment answering a different
  question. The seam means *archive the stream*, and both siblings queue their archive operation
  there.
- **`FetchLatest` by natural key threw on a miss** where the contract is null.
- **Renaming a natural key left the old row behind**, so a superseded identifier resolved forever
  and its slot in the lookup's primary key could never be reused.

Two features were built to enrol rather than to gate: `Fisher.Batching.FetchStreamStatePlan` /
`FetchStreamPlan` (parity with polecat#370), and the compliance registrar's `UseMessageOutbox`.

**The three gated-off suites decline a LINQ surface, not a behaviour.** `DcbHasTagLinqCompliance`,
`AggregateToLinqOperatorCompliance` and `AggregateToManyCompliance` all terminate a cross-stream
`QueryAllRawEvents()` returning `IQueryable<IEvent>`. Fisher's LINQ provider is built over *document*
storage — statements, selectors and member factories all resolve against a `fi_doc_*` table — so an
event queryable would be a parallel provider serving one caller, which is why
`EventOperations.QueryEventsAsync` takes a predicate and `AssignTagWhere` reaches the same parser
through `EventMemberFactory` instead. The capabilities themselves are covered and green through
`DcbTagQueryAndConsistencyCompliance`, `AssignTagWhereCompliance` and `AggregateByTagsAsync`.

### History

**Fisher was enrolled in full — all 37 suites, 320 tests — as of 2.56.0.** The most recently enrolled are `BinaryEventSerializationCompliance` (6, the event half's
twenty-ninth) and `DocumentSessionEventsCompliance` (5) from 2.50.0, and 2.51.0's two:
`PendingStreamActionsCompliance` (9, fisher#96) and `AggregateWriteCacheCompliance` (14, fisher#97).
All four are **opt-in** — their contract members carry throwing defaults, so enrolling is a deliberate
line rather than something a bump does to you.

**2.52.0 added the 37th suite and 2.56.0 the 320th test, and nothing between them moved.**
`DocumentCommitListenerCompliance` (10) is the document half's seventh; 2.52.1, 2.53.0, 2.54.0 and
2.55.0 changed no suite file at all. 2.56.0 added one test —
`EventStoreExplorerCompliance.usage_describes_the_registered_projections`, jasperfx#700 — which is
**fisher#120's regression guard, and shared rather than Fisher-local on purpose**: `TryCreateUsage`
had one shared test asserting on `usage.Events` alone, so a store could fill that slot, leave the
rest of `EventStoreUsage` empty and still pass the suite. Nothing about the omission was
dialect-specific, so no store-level decision existed to prompt anybody to look. Fisher passed it
unchanged on the bump — see "What `TryCreateUsage` puts on the wire" for the one-line fix it holds
in place.

2.51.0's third change is fisher#98 and is fixture-side: `DocumentComplianceConfig.StreamIdentity`
(jasperfx#672) replaced an inference `FisherDocumentComplianceFixture` was making — string identity
whenever the config declared event types, right only for as long as `DocumentSessionEventsCompliance`
was the sole suite populating `EventTypes`.
The event sourcing half is 28 suites and 230 tests and has been the whole library since 2.45.0
emptied the upstream event sourcing backlog; **2.46.0 added no suite and no test** (fisher#64), and
**2.48.0 added neither, and changed no existing suite file** — the counts were re-verified against a
real run on each rather than carried over, since "still 32" is exactly the claim a bump can quietly
falsify. **2.47.0 added a second half rather than another event suite** — four *document* suites,
over the store-agnostic contract described below.

**2.49.0 is the first bump to widen an existing suite rather than add one** (fisher#89 / jasperfx#665).
No new suite file; `DocumentLoadAndStoreCompliance` gained three tests, taking the document half from
42 to 45, and `DocumentComplianceConfig` gained `ValueTypes` / `RegisterValueType<T>()` because the
strong-typed facts need the identity type registered and the document contract carries no identity
configuration. **That shape is worth noticing**: a bump whose suite *list* is unchanged can still
demand production work, so diffing the file list is not enough — diff the contents. The three tests
are two strong-typed facts and one guarding the canonical case, which is the one an override gets
wrong; see "The store-agnostic document contract".
The four that arrived in 2.40.0/2.41.0 — `StringStreamIdentityCompliance`,
`SnapshotLifecycleCompliance`, `MultiStreamProjectionCompliance`, `FlatTableProjectionCompliance` —
went in on the same bump.

`StrongTypedIdentityCompliance` arrived in 2.42.0 and went green in fisher#14. It has no capability
flag to decline with, so a store either passes it or leaves it unsubclassed.
`FisherComplianceFixture.FisherComplianceRegistrar.RegisterValueType<TValue>` is a **no-op**, which is
the correct implementation for a store that discovers value types by itself — see "Strong-typed
identities".

`EventDataMaskingCompliance` and `StreamCompactingCompliance` arrived in 2.43.0 and **both went green
on the bump alone** — 21 tests, no production change. That is the useful thing about them: fisher#9
and fisher#10 were built from Polecat's shape months before a shared suite existed to check the shape
was right, and the suites are what turns "ported faithfully" from a claim into a fact. Compacting
needed nothing at all — `CompactStreamAsync<T>` was lifted onto `IEventStoreOperations` in 2.41.0, so
the suite reaches it through the shared surface. Masking cost **three seam members and no more**,
because `IEventDataMasking` is shared but the entry point that hands one out is not: every store spells
it on its own `Advanced` surface, and those share no interface.

- `FisherComplianceFixture.ApplyEventDataMaskingAsync` delegates to
  `Store.Advanced.ApplyEventDataMaskingAsync` — the signatures already matched one for one.
- The registrar's two `AddMaskingRule<TEvent>` overloads delegate to
  `EventGraph.AddMaskingRuleForProtectedInformation<T>`. The `Action` / `Func` split the seam demands
  is the same split Fisher already had, and for the same reason — see "Event data masking" for why
  only the `Action` form reaches contravariantly.

`RebuildAndCatchUpCompliance` and `DeadLetterCompliance` arrived in 2.44.0 and **both went green on
the bump alone** — 17 tests, no production change and no seam addition, the cheapest wave yet. Both
were filed upstream as needing a seam and turned out not to: the whole rebuild surface (seven
`RebuildProjectionAsync` overloads, both `CatchUpAsync` forms, `PrepareForRebuildsAsync`) is already
declared on `IProjectionDaemon`, and the dead letter path is `IEventStore<,>.ContinuousErrors` plus
`IEventStore.AllDatabases()` → `IEventDatabase.QueryDeadLetterEventsAsync`, all of which Fisher
already implements.

`ConjoinedEventTenancyCompliance` and `SubscriptionCompliance` arrived in 2.45.0 and **both went green
on the bump** — 14 tests, no production change, at the cost of two seam members and one partial.

- **The tenancy suite is the first to check a Fisher feature nothing cross-store had covered.** Every
  earlier suite either confirmed a port or demanded a new feature; conjoined event tenancy was built
  with the original schema work and had only Fisher's own `event_store_schema_creation` holding it —
  a schema test, which cannot see the property that matters. That property is *isolation*, and its
  failure mode is silent and asymmetric: a store that leaks across tenants still answers correctly for
  the tenant owning the data and misbehaves only for the other one. The suite checks both directions
  on every test, over a stream id deliberately reused across two tenants.
- **`ConjoinedEventTenancy` must be applied before the schema is created.** `StreamsTable` and
  `EventsTable` read `TenancyStyle` when they build their columns and their primary key, so the
  fixture sets it inside the `DocumentStore.For` lambda, ahead of
  `ApplyAllConfiguredChangesToDatabaseAsync`. It is a schema decision, not a runtime one.
- **Verified load-bearing by removing it**, which is the discipline a suite that passes on the bump
  deserves — that is exactly where a seam member quietly doing nothing would hide. Without the flag
  the suite fails with `ExistingStreamIdCollisionException` from `AppendPlanner`, the "collide on
  append" outcome the suite's own notes predict for a store keying on id alone.
- **The subscription's name is pinned, not defaulted.** `SubscriptionWrapper` derives
  `ComplianceSubscription` from the type name anyway, so the registrar's explicit
  `options.Name = ComplianceSubscription.SubscriptionName` is redundant today — deliberately. Daemon
  progression is keyed on that string, and the seam should not rest on a naming convention Fisher
  could reasonably change.
- **`ComplianceSubscription` is the second shared type an alias cannot reach**, after
  `ComplianceFlatTableProjection`, so it needs a per-consumer partial
  (`Compliance/ComplianceSubscription.Fisher.cs`). Fisher's is the closest of the three stores to
  being writable once: `ISubscription.ProcessEventsAsync` returns JasperFx's lifted
  `IDaemonChangeListener` rather than a product-local `IChangeListener`, because fisher#21 took the
  shared type instead of copying Polecat's older spelling.

- **The dead letter suite reaches the error policy by casting the fixture's non-generic
  `IEventStore` to the closed generic.** Safe because the suite is generic over the same session pair
  the store closes over, and worth knowing as a general trick: it reaches the whole generic store
  surface without adding a seam member. Fisher's `ContinuousErrors` returns
  `Options.Projections.Errors` — the live options object, not a per-read copy, which
  `skip_apply_errors_is_readable_back_off_the_shared_options` pins directly and
  `the_shard_survives_a_poison_event_and_keeps_going` pins indirectly by requiring the daemon to have
  actually consulted it.
- **The rebuild suite's teardown test is the one that matters**, and it is the reason this wave was
  worth having rather than a formality. A rebuild that replays onto surviving rows looks correct for
  every stream whose events still exist and is wrong only for rows the replay can no longer produce —
  so it passes any assertion about a live aggregate. The suite plants a document with no backing
  events and requires the rebuild to remove it. That is the same divergence Fisher's own
  `TeardownExistingProjectionStateAsync` had to learn for flat tables (see "Flat-table projections",
  `IPublishesTables`), now checked for document projections too.
- **Upstream disclosed an unreproduced intermittent** in `a_rebuild_reproduces_the_projected_state` —
  two failures on Polecat early in that suite's development, none since. Not seen on Fisher: 15
  consecutive runs of the suite clean, plus the full 216 twice. Recorded so a first sighting here is
  recognised rather than investigated from scratch.

The four **document** suites — `DocumentSessionCompliance`, `DocumentLoadAndStoreCompliance`,
`DocumentDeleteCompliance`, `DocumentQueryCompliance` — arrived in 2.47.0 and are a second half rather
than a fifth wave of the same thing: they hold the *document* store to a shared definition, which
nothing cross-store did before. See "The store-agnostic document contract" for the binding and for the
two Fisher-specific fixture notes. Two things worth knowing here:

- **`DocumentQueryCompliance` is not a LINQ conformance suite and upstream is emphatic that it must
  not become one.** The standing Critter Stack position — LINQ is out of shared-compliance scope
  permanently, not pending a contract — is unchanged. What it pins is narrower and different in kind:
  the *minimum translatable set* `Query<T>()` promises, since a consumer holding only `IQueryable<T>`
  cannot discover whether `OrderBy` is translated or silently unsupported. Fisher supports far more and
  is deliberately not held to any of it here.
- **This is what replaces the hand-comparison sweep.** Fisher's document parity with Polecat was
  established by the file-by-file comparison that filed fisher#22–#50, which is a one-time act;
  enrolling converts it into a standing definition three stores are held to.

The mechanics, because they are not what the package's name suggests:

- **Every suite compiles; only the subclassed ones run.** Enrolling is one empty class in
  `fisher_event_store_compliance.cs`. Not enrolling costs nothing at runtime — but the shared source
  still has to compile, which is why every global alias in `ComplianceAliases.cs` must resolve
  even for suites Fisher cannot pass.
- Every suite now compiles. The two `EventProjection*` suites were once `<Compile Remove>`d because
  they call `IDocumentSession.Store` and `IQuerySession.LoadAsync`; document storage made them
  compile and they are enrolled.
- **Nothing in `FisherComplianceFixture` throws any more.** The standing discipline is that a member
  Fisher cannot honour throws a `NotSupportedException` naming its milestone, so enrolling a suite
  prematurely fails loudly rather than passing on a stub — but as of fisher#14 there is no such
  member left. Keep the discipline for the next seam member that arrives ahead of the feature.
- `CleanEventDataAsync` delegates to `Advanced.Clean.DeleteAllEventDataAsync`. It is called before
  every test, so it must not throw the way an unsupported member would — hence the null guard rather
  than the `Store` accessor.
- **`QueryTableAsync` is the seam's only raw data access**, added in 2.41.0 for the flat-table suite —
  a table name in, every row out, deliberately predicate-free. Fisher's implementation does the
  schema fold and **converts a lowercase-canonical Guid string back to a `Guid`**. That conversion is
  not a fudge: SQL Server has `uniqueidentifier` and PostgreSQL has `uuid`, so on both siblings the
  provider hands the suite a `Guid` and `Equals(row["id"], streamId)` matches. SQLite has no such
  type, so something has to convert, and doing it there is the same explicit `Guid.Parse` the row
  readers do. Matching on the canonical rendering rather than `Guid.TryParse` alone is what keeps it
  from claiming an ordinary string column holding Guid-shaped text in some other casing.
- A suite may gate itself on a fixture capability flag rather than on enrollment —
  `SupportsFlatTableProjections` is the 2.41.0 example, and exists so a store can enroll the suite
  before the feature and use it as the specification. Fisher leaves it true; the suite's projection
  still needs a real `FlatTableProjection` base to compile against either way, and Fisher's half of
  that shim is `Compliance/ComplianceFlatTableProjection.Fisher.cs`.

### Session metadata on appended events

`AppendPlanner.ApplySessionMetadata` copies the session's correlation id, causation id, user name and
headers onto each event that does not already carry its own, each gated on its `Enable*` option. The
session seeds correlation/causation from `Activity.Current` (`RootId` and `ParentId`) at construction,
so tracing context reaches events with no application code; an explicit assignment afterwards wins.

**A stream carrying no events is dropped from the unit of work — unless it asked not to be.**
`CollectActionableStreams` keeps only streams with at least one event, and `CollectGuardOnlyStreams`
beside it keeps the ones flagged `IEventStream.AlwaysEnforceConsistency` with an
`ExpectedVersionOnServer` set, so their version is re-read and checked under the write lock with no
append written. Until fisher#184 the flag did nothing at all: it is on the shared `IEventStream`,
Fisher forwarded it to the `StreamAction` faithfully, and nothing else in the store ever read it.
That is invisible to any ordinary append test, because appending a single event brings the ordinary
guard back — the flag's whole subject is the *empty* case, "I read this stream, decided on the
strength of what I read to write nothing, and that decision is only sound if the stream has not
moved". `AlwaysEnforceConsistencyCompliance` is what found it.

This duplicates the private `StreamAction.ProcessMetadata`, which is normally reached through
`StreamAction.PrepareEvents` — and Fisher **cannot** use `PrepareEvents`. In Quick mode it numbers
events only when `ExpectedVersionOnServer` is already set, because Marten and Polecat let the database
assign versions while Fisher numbers them client-side from the version it just read. Pre-setting
`ExpectedVersionOnServer` to make it number them would make the optimistic-concurrency check inside
the same method compare that value against itself and pass unconditionally. Keeping version
assignment and metadata application apart is what keeps the guard real; the cost is that a new
metadata field in JasperFx will not reach Fisher's events until this method learns about it.

#### `Timestamp`, and that cost coming due — fisher#119

**The cost named above is not hypothetical, and `Timestamp` is the field it came due on.**
`PrepareEvents` stamps it (as `EventSlice` does for a projection's raised events) and
`ApplySessionMetadata` did not — so an event reached an inline projection carrying
`DateTimeOffset.MinValue`, and every read model recording `e.Timestamp` baked in a year-0001 date.
Worse than merely wrong: **the same projection produced different documents inline and rebuilt**,
because replay reads the column, so the divergence was invisible until somebody looked at a date.

- **One reading per stream, not per event** — the events of one append share a moment the way they
  share a transaction — and **round-tripped through `SqliteTimestamp` before it is assigned**. The
  column keeps milliseconds, so stamping raw ticks would leave the inline view sub-millisecond ahead
  of every later read of the same event: the same divergence, one digit further down.
- **`FisherQuickAppendEventsOperation` persists the stamped value instead of `NowExpression`**
  whenever it is set. That is the half that makes the two views agree; stamping alone would have
  fixed the year-0001 symptom and left inline and replay a clock apart.
- **Guarded on `== default`**, so a caller's own value survives — and so does the first attempt's
  when the resilience pipeline re-executes the write delegate. A retried commit therefore persists
  the moment the append was made rather than the moment it finally won the write lock, which is
  exactly what the inline projection already folded on attempt one.
- **Raised events are stamped by JasperFx before they ever reach here**, so the guard leaves them
  alone and the operation now persists their value too. They previously took the column default; the
  two paths are consistent for free.

**The trade, which is real and is not closable.** With inline projections registered the reading is
taken in `AssignVersionsAheadOfProjectionsAsync` — *outside* the write lock, because running before
it is that pass's whole purpose — so `fi_events.timestamp` is no longer strictly monotonic with
`seq_id`. Two writers on different streams can stamp in one order and commit in the other, skewed by
at most the write-lock wait. **Same-stream ordering is untouched**: the loser of a concurrent append
to one stream fails the optimistic guard rather than interleaving, so `FetchStreamAsync`'s timestamp
bound and the rewrite operations' assumption both still hold where they are actually read. The one
consumer reading that order *across* streams is `FindEventStoreFloorAtTimeAsync`, whose
`max(seq_id) where timestamp <= ?` can floor a rebuild-from-timestamp one skew window off.

It cannot be had both ways — an inline projection cannot see the final timestamp before the write
lock is taken *and* have it assigned under that lock. Marten resolves it identically, and
`EventAppendMode.Quick`'s own doc comment says timestamps come from `TimeProvider`, so this is the
family's behaviour rather than a Fisher concession, and ported projection code now behaves the same
here as it does there. **Without inline projections nothing moves at all**: the stamp is taken in
`PlanAsync`, which runs inside the write transaction.

#### Closed upstream gap — jasperfx#663

Historical, and the second completed cycle of the "workaround, filed upstream, removed when the fix
ships" rule after `FisherCommandBuilder`. This method used to stamp the stream's own identity onto
each event as well (fisher#72). `StreamAction.AddEvent` stamps `StreamId`/`StreamKey`/`TenantId` and
the `Guid` append factory went through it — but `StreamAction.Append(graph, string, …)` appended
straight to the backing list and did not, and `PrepareEvents` did not close the gap either (it sets
`TenantId`, `Timestamp`, `Version` and `Sequence`, never the stream identity). So **every event
appended to a string-identified stream reached an inline projection with an empty `StreamKey`** —
which is exactly how such a projection learns which entity it is projecting. Nothing threw: the
projection ran and wrote a document with a blank field, and the first visible symptom was a query
returning nothing.

Fixed upstream by [jasperfx#663](https://github.com/JasperFx/jasperfx/issues/663) and shipped in
**JasperFx 2.48.0**, which routes both string overloads through `AddEvents`. **The workaround is gone;
do not reintroduce it.** Verified by deleting it and running the full suite against 2.48.0 — 1228
green, including the test written to fail without it. That removal is also what makes 2.48.0 a real
floor for Fisher rather than a preference.

**The async daemon was never affected** — `FisherEventLoader` hydrates through
`FisherEventsRowReader.ReadEventAcrossStreams`, which takes the identity off the row.
`event_envelope_metadata_in_projections` now guards the upstream fix rather than a Fisher workaround,
and still pins **both** identities: the asymmetry was upstream's, so a later release must not silently
change which half is covered, and the Guid half passing is what tells a regression apart from a broken
test.

`ComplianceEventProjection` binds to `Fisher.Projections.EventProjection`. Its one required member,
`storeEntity`, is now an ordinary `IDocumentSession.Store` onto the session the events are committing
in, so a `Create`/`Project` method's return value lands in the same transaction as the event that
produced it. `inline_event_projections` covers it directly — note that a conventional-method
projection class must be declared `partial`, because the dispatcher is source-generated into it and
there is no runtime fallback.

### What the nupkg carries beyond Fisher.dll

**`JasperFx.Events.SourceGenerator` is bundled into the package as an analyzer** (fisher#73), the way
Marten (marten#4557) and Polecat (polecat#196) both bundle it into theirs. Projection dispatch is
source-generated with no runtime reflection fallback, and the generator ships as a development
dependency that does **not** flow transitively — so a consumer referencing only the Fisher package
never ran it.

**The absence is silent in the worst direction.** It is not a build failure: removing the generator
removes generated partials that nothing hand-written references, so the consuming assembly *compiles
clean* and then throws `No source-generated dispatcher found for EventProjection …` on its first
projected event. In a service that is a clean deploy followed by a crash on the first message.

Three things hold it in place, and none is a test — the test projects reference the generator
directly, so no test inside this repository can observe the packaged shape:

- `_BundleEventsSourceGeneratorAnalyzer` in `Fisher.csproj` contributes the analyzer DLL to
  `analyzers/dotnet/cs`. It runs **per-TFM**, because `$(PkgJasperFx_Events_SourceGenerator)` is only
  resolved there, and is **conditioned on one target framework**, because the analyzer is
  TFM-agnostic and both passes claiming the same package path fails pack on a duplicate file.
- The `package` job in `.github/workflows/fisher.yml` packs and asserts the DLL is present **and**
  that the nuspec does not declare the generator as a dependency. `PrivateAssets=all` is load-bearing
  for the second half: a generator that flows downstream is double-loaded by a project referencing
  two Critter Stack stores, which emits each `.Evolver` partial twice and fails with CS0111.
  JasperFx 2.75.0's dedupe target (jasperfx#891/#895) now keeps one copy when two *do* reach a
  project, so that failure is upstream's to prevent — but the nuspec assertion stays, because a
  dependency Fisher never meant to declare is wrong whether or not something downstream tidies it up.
- **`smoke/packaged-consumer`, run by the same job** (fisher#337), is the half the two assertions above
  cannot reach: a project that references *only* the packed Fisher, the way an application does. It sets
  `JasperFxEventsRequireSourceGenerator` (jasperfx#892), so a generator that stopped flowing out of the
  package fails its build with `JFXEVT900`, and then runs a conventional aggregate — live and inline — to
  prove the attached generator dispatches. It packs a `0.0.0-smoke` version into a private feed and
  restores into its own package folder with source mapping pinning `Fisher` to that feed, because
  otherwise it could pass against the last published release instead of the commit under test. Not in
  `fisher.slnx`, since the package it restores exists only after `dotnet pack`.
  - ⚠️ **`ExcludeAssets="analyzers"` on the consumer's `Fisher` reference did NOT detach the bundled
    analyzer** when this was built — the guard still reported it attached. So verifying `JFXEVT900` meant
    removing the `Analyzer` item in a target instead; do not reach for `ExcludeAssets` as the negative
    test.

**The in-repo half is asserted as well**: `Fisher.Tests`, both companion test projects and
`Fisher.Benchmarks` set `JasperFxEventsRequireSourceGenerator`, so an edit that detached the generator
from one of them is a build error rather than a projection test failing somewhere far from the cause.

## The companion packages

Two, both modelled on Polecat's and Marten's, both multi-targeting net9.0/net10.0 as the core does.

### `Fisher.AspNetCore` (fisher#49)

Streaming `IResult` types, ETag handling, event-stream results and a high-water health check.

**The streaming results are worth more here than on either sibling, and the reason is structural.**
They exist to skip a deserialize-then-reserialize round trip. On Marten and Polecat that saves CPU for
data that already crossed a network from a database server, so it is a fraction of the cost. **Fisher's
database is the web process**, so the round trip *is* the cost — an endpoint reading a document and
returning it goes from "parse JSON, build an object, serialize an object" to "copy bytes".

- **`StreamMany<T>` diverges from Polecat's, and that is the point.** Polecat's materializes objects
  and calls `JsonSerializer.SerializeToUtf8Bytes`, which throws away the saving the type exists for.
  Fisher's uses fisher#28's `ToJsonArrayAsync`, which concatenates the stored `data` columns in .NET —
  nothing parsed, nothing re-rendered, and no `json_group_array` (that function re-parses and reorders
  object keys).
- **The bytes are exactly what was stored**, and `stream_one_writes_the_stored_bytes` asserts against
  the serializer's own output rather than a literal. Neither sibling can promise this: `jsonb`
  normalises whitespace and key order, `nvarchar` needs an encoding decision.
- **`StreamPaged`'s total is a header and a second statement**, not an envelope and not
  `count(*) over ()` — the window function returns no row for a page past the end, which is when a
  pager most needs the total. Same reasoning fisher#27 and the explorer's paging both record.
- **`StreamAggregate` reads the ETag before folding.** A stream's version moves if and only if an
  event was appended, so a matching `If-None-Match` answers `304` having read one row of `fi_streams`
  and folded nothing. For a long stream that is the whole value.
- **`ToJsonCursorPageAsync` shares its preparation with the typed `ToCursorPageAsync`** rather than
  repeating it. The ordering validation, the decode and the seek predicate are subtle enough that two
  copies would drift, and a drift there is a pager that silently skips or repeats rows.
- **`IQuerySession` gained `Events`.** An endpoint or a report taking a read session could not read
  streams before. Marten and Polecat narrow theirs to a read-only event surface; Fisher does not, for
  the same reason `IQuerySession` is itself a convention rather than a guarantee.
- **The health check has an argument of its own.** Fisher's daemon *warns* rather than refuses when
  the journal mode is not WAL, because that misconfiguration presents as a slow projection; this is how
  an operator finds out the warning mattered. Its stuck-mark message says so. What it *reads* is the
  poll-cycle age, with the gap heuristic as the secondary — see the async daemon's
  `HighWaterLivenessInterval` note for why the heartbeat column is not an option (fisher#60).
- **`StreamOne` serves a numeric-revisioned document from its `revision`** (fisher#62, the
  marten#5120 class). The two concurrency styles are alternatives, and a revision validates a cached
  representation exactly as well as a Guid version — refusing one of them left the whole revisioned
  half of a store unable to emit an ETag, with a message recommending the wrong setting.
  **Two read methods where Marten widened one**, because the flavors are two physical columns here
  (`guid_version` and `revision`) rather than one `mt_version` read at either width; `VersionSourceFor<T>()`
  is how a caller asks which applies, and no fail-fast guard against both was needed —
  `AssertConcurrencyIsCoherent` already refuses that pair at configuration time.
- **Three of marten#5157/#5158/#5166's hardening did not reproduce, for structural reasons rather
  than luck**, and `streaming_hardening` pins each so it stays that way. A 304 already returned before
  the write; a JSON read names its columns (`data, guid_version`) instead of aliasing whatever the
  storage selected, so neither a `Select` projection nor a tracking session can move the payload —
  marten#5166 was a 200 whose body was the document's id, through exactly that positional assumption.
- **A cursor whose key does not bind to its ordering member is an `ArgumentException`** (fisher#62,
  the marten#5029 class), not the `InvalidOperationException` `JsonElement` raises. The payload's
  shape was already checked; the per-key *bind* was not, so one way of malforming a client-supplied
  cursor produced a 400 and another a 500.
- **MCP endpoints are deliberately not ported.** That surface is moving upstream, and porting it
  speculatively would mean maintaining a copy of something about to change.
- Tested against a `DefaultHttpContext` with a `MemoryStream` body rather than through a test host: an
  `IResult`'s whole job is what it writes to a response, and a host would add a pipeline none of the
  assertions are about.
- ⚠️ **No test in this project may hold a wall-clock budget, and none does** (fisher#189). The suite
  once failed 12 of 36 on a loaded host and went green on retry, which sent a hunt for timing
  assumptions; the audit found exactly one — a two-second sleep followed by a demand that
  `last_updated` be under **one** second old, for a 200 ms poll cycle. It is now "poll until the value
  moves", which a slow host makes slower rather than wrong. Everything else already waited 30 seconds
  or moved a `TimeProvider`, and that is the standard to hold new tests to.
  - **The one `GetAwaiter().GetResult()` went with it.** Blocking a thread-pool thread on async I/O is
    how a saturated pool turns a passing test into a transient failure — the blocked thread waits for
    a continuation that needs a pool thread of its own. It was the only such call in the repository.
  - ⚠️ **Neither is a proven cause, and the shape of the evidence points elsewhere.** 35 runs under
    three- and four-way load have not reproduced it (`scripts/repro_aspnetcore_flake.sh`). Every class
    here builds its store and runs the schema migration in `InitializeAsync`, so one exception there
    fails that whole class at once — and "12 of 36, transiently, green on retry" fits `11 + 1`, one
    class plus a straggler, far better than a dozen independent flakes do. The harness now tallies
    failures per class for exactly that reason: a class at its full size means the fixture died, and
    that is a different investigation from a flaky assertion.

### `Fisher.EntityFrameworkCore` (fisher#50)

`DbContextTransactionParticipant<TContext>` over the `ITransactionParticipant` seam in the core.

**Verified before anything was built on it**, the discipline fisher#38 and fisher#2 both followed.
Against EF Core 9.0.14 and Microsoft.Data.Sqlite 10.0.9: `Database.UseTransaction` enlists,
`SaveChangesAsync` writes inside the transaction, another connection sees nothing until the commit,
and a rollback takes EF's write with it. All four are what the seam needs and none was safe to assume.

- **The safe constructor takes a factory over the connection Fisher supplies**, so the trap is not
  expressible. The one taking a built context checks `Database.GetDbConnection()` **by reference** —
  two connections to one file have the same connection string and are still two writers, so comparing
  strings would pass the exact case the check exists to catch.
- **That trap is a self-deadlock, not a slow path.** EF's write on a second connection blocks on
  Fisher's write lock *from inside Fisher's own transaction*, so it hangs rather than failing and
  nothing ever reports it. Refusing before the write beats a timeout, which beats a deadlock.
- **The package references `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Relational` only.** Which EF provider a
  `DbContext` uses is the application's decision; referencing the Sqlite provider would be Fisher
  making it for them, even though on SQLite it is nearly always the right one.
- **Pinned to EF Core 9.x, not 10.x**, because the package multi-targets net9.0 and net10.0 and EF
  Core 10 is net10-only. 9.x targets net8.0, so it loads on both.
- **`CompletelyRemoveAllAsync` leaves EF's tables alone**, because it filters by the `fi_` prefix.
  Correct — Fisher owning the file does not make it Fisher's to clear — and pinned so nobody "fixes" it.

**Projections whose documents are EF entities** — `options.ProjectToEfCore<TDoc, TId, TContext>(table,
factory)`, over `Projections.StorageProviders` in the core.

- **The registration is the whole seam, and that is the divergence from Polecat.** An ordinary
  `SingleStreamProjection<TDoc, TId>` or `MultiStreamProjection<TDoc, TId>` with conventional `Apply`
  methods writes into EF without knowing it does; the projection never mentions EF. Polecat's EF path
  is reachable only by deriving from `EfCoreSingleStreamProjection`/`EfCoreMultiStreamProjection`,
  which makes every EF-backed projection a different *kind* of projection. Fisher's one base class,
  `EfCoreEventProjection<TContext>`, exists for the per-event shape — which genuinely needs one,
  having no storage indirection to swap — and `EfCoreContext<TDoc, TId, TContext>()` on the identity
  setter is the escape hatch for an `Apply` that wants the context.
- **The context reads on its own connection and is moved onto Fisher's to write**, and both halves are
  forced rather than chosen. A projection's storage is resolved *before* the batch has opened the
  connection it will commit on, so there is nothing to build against; and the storage reads — every
  slice loads its current aggregate — long before there is a transaction to read in. **Verified
  against EF Core 9.0.14 and Microsoft.Data.Sqlite 10.0.9 before anything was built on it**, the
  discipline fisher#38 and fisher#2 both followed: a context that has already queried through its own
  connection accepts `SetDbConnection` onto another and writes through it, and a read on EF's own
  connection does not block against a `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` held elsewhere on the file. The second is the
  one that would have turned an EF-backed projection into a hang.
- **Nothing is written until the batch commits**, which is the same discipline `FisherProjectionStorage`
  follows by queueing operations. Here it is not merely tidy: writing as it went would be a second
  connection writing while the batch holds the file's one write lock.
- **The batch disposes the participants it was given**, because an EF-backed projection's `DbContext`
  is created per batch and cannot dispose itself — it has to outlive the apply that created it *and*
  survive a retried commit. Disposing at the batch boundary covers the failed batch too, which is the
  case that would otherwise leak a context per attempt behind a persistently failing shard.
  - ⚠️ **And so does the session, for the `Inline` lifecycle, which had no owner at all** (fisher#305,
    the marten#5457 class reached from the other side). fisher#50 gave the async path a drain and
    fisher#305 was filed to *confirm* it; the confirmation found the async path correct and the inline
    path leaking a context per `SaveChangesAsync`, because an inline projection runs inside
    `FisherSession.SaveChangesAsync` and there is no `FisherProjectionBatch` in that story. The
    interesting part is which fix is wrong:
  - ⚠️ **Releasing participants on session disposal is the obvious fix and it silently breaks the
    daemon.** `ProjectionExecution.buildBatchWithNoSkippingAsync` takes a session out of the batch with
    `await using` and disposes it *as soon as the projection has been applied*, while the batch lives
    on to run the participants' `BeforeCommitAsync` — so a session-disposal drain destroys the context
    between the apply and the write and the entities are never saved, with no error anywhere.
    `FisherSession.ParticipantsOwnedByBatch`, set by `FisherProjectionBatch.SessionForTenant`, is what
    separates the two owners; the batch calls the session's own drain rather than looping itself, so
    the release lives in one place and taking-and-nulling the list makes a second call a no-op.
    `an_async_event_projection_disposes_the_context_it_created` asserts the rows landed as well as the
    counts, which is what makes it discriminating — the counts alone are satisfied by the broken fix.
  - **Construction counted against disposal, not backends counted in the database.** marten#5466's
    choice, and the main thing worth carrying over: the reported symptom is a leaked connection per
    batch, which surfaces only when the context owns its connection, where the defect underneath pins
    deterministically with no pool timing and no sampling. Every test also asserts a context *was*
    built, or it passes vacuously against a store that created none — Marten's first attempt counted
    connections, passed on unfixed master and proved nothing.
  - **Ownership stays the participant's to decide.** `DbContextTransactionParticipant` disposes its
    context only in the `MovingOntoFishersConnection` mode; a context from DI belongs to its scope. So
    both drains dispose the *participant*, never anything it holds — which is why a blunt "dispose
    everything the session saw" fix would have been wrong in the other direction.
  - **The participant gained `IDisposable` beside `IAsyncDisposable`**, because `AddFisher` registers
    sessions scoped and a synchronously-disposed container scope can only reach the sync form —
    fisher#20's argument for `IDocumentStore`, one type over. `DbContext` supplies both, so nothing
    blocks.
  - **A commit releases the participants its own inline projections enlisted, and nothing else**
    (fisher#319). Without it a session committing N times held N contexts until disposal, each also
    invoked on every later commit to save nothing — because `EfCoreEventProjection.ApplyAsync` builds
    a fresh one per unit of work and cannot dispose it.
    - ⚠️ **Scoped to the projections' own window, not by clearing the list**, and that is what keeps
      it from being a contract change. `AddTransactionParticipant` says "this unit of work's
      transaction", which argues for per-commit release — but the implementation has always kept a
      caller's participant across commits, and one silently missing from the second commit is a worse
      failure than the accumulation. `SaveChangesAsync` records the participant count before the
      projections run and releases only what they added.
    - **Positional rather than by identity**, because participants are only ever appended and nothing
      removes one mid-commit, so the entries at and after the mark are exactly the ones added.
    - **Last thing in `SaveChangesAsync`**, after the session listeners: a listener's
      `AfterCommitAsync` can still reach what a projection enlisted, and the participant's own
      `AfterCommitAsync` — which is where an EF context accepts its changes — has already run.
    - **`an_inline_projection_holds_one_context_per_commit_and_no_more` asserts "at most one alive at
      a time", not a total.** Three commits build three contexts either way; the number that tells a
      fix from a leak is how many are outstanding, so it compares created against disposed after each
      commit. `a_caller_enlisted_participant_survives_a_commit` is the other side and passes either
      way, which is what it is for.
- **Under conjoined events the entity must implement `JasperFx.MultiTenancy.ITenanted`** (fisher#334),
  and `ProjectionTenancyGuard` refuses the store otherwise — Marten's and Polecat's EF rule. The storage
  used to carry its tenant and write it *nowhere*, so every tenant's same-id stream folded into one
  entity, the fisher#335 shape reached through EF. Now `AddOrUpdate` stamps `TenantId` before EF reads
  the key, and every lookup goes through `FindUnsafe`, which is tenant-scoped two ways:
  - **A composite `(TenantId, Id)` key is accepted**, and is the one composite `KeyProperties` does not
    refuse — `Find` takes the values in EF's key order, so the tenant slots in wherever the model put it.
    This is what lets two tenants share a stream id.
  - **With an id-only key, another tenant's row is declined rather than folded onto** (`OwnedByThisTenant`),
    and the insert that follows fails on the key — loud, where handing it back would silently rewrite
    another tenant's entity.
  - The **aggregation base classes stay absent on purpose** — the registration is the seam, above — which
    is issue point 1's answer; `ef_core_tenancy` is the three facts Marten and Polecat each carry, plus
    the refusal. All four fail against the previous build.
- **A registered type is deliberately not mapped**, so registering the projection skips its mapping
  and the type gets no `fi_doc_*` table. That is what makes registration-before-projection
  load-bearing, and it is checked rather than documented — the same "this line has to come first"
  shape fisher#39 gave `SeedInitialDataOnStartup`.
  - **Both registration doors skip it, which was fisher#111**: only `Snapshot<T>` carried the
    `HasProviderFor` guard, so `Projections.Add(projection, lifecycle)` mapped the type anyway and
    left a stray, empty table in the migration. `Add` is the only door for a multi-stream projection,
    so that was *every* EF-backed one. Silent in both directions — the projection works, because
    storage resolution checks the registry first, and the table sits in the schema forever. The guard
    is per published type rather than per projection, since a projection may publish several and only
    some of them be registered.
- **Rebuild teardown reads the table name off the registry**, because the sweep that finds a
  projection's tables looks at *mapped* types. **This is the flat-table lesson one layer over** — the
  same gap `IPublishesTables` closes, reached from the other direction, and without it a rebuild
  replays onto the rows the previous run left. Pinned with a row the replay cannot recreate.
- **Fisher does not create the EF table.** Fisher owns the shape of tables it prefixes `fi_`; an
  entity's shape is the `DbContext`'s, so creating it is EF's job. Same reasoning that keeps
  `CompletelyRemoveAllAsync` from dropping them.
- `LoadManyAsync` is `FindAsync` per id rather than one `Contains` query, because Find answers from the
  change tracker first — so a slice whose entity this batch already touched comes back as the **same
  instance**, where a query would materialise a second one and the two would race at commit.
- Registering a bare `IProjection` now wraps it in JasperFx's `ProjectionWrapper`, which Fisher had no
  path for before: `Projections.Add(ProjectionBase, ...)` assumed every projection base was also an
  `IProjectionSource`. Polecat wraps in the same place.
- **`EfCoreProjectionStorage.IsThreadSafe` is `false`, and the `SemaphoreSlim` beside it is not an
  alternative to that** (fisher#108, over jasperfx#683). `AggregationRunner` posts a range's slices
  into a fixed ten-wide `Block` — ten real reader tasks — against one storage instance, and a
  `DbContext` is not thread-safe. The lock serializes each individual *call*; what it cannot close is
  the window *between* two, where one thread's aggregation mutates entities that another thread's
  `Entry()` is running `DetectChanges` over. Nothing reachable from inside the storage can stop the
  fan-out, which is why the seam had to be upstream. `FisherProjectionStorage` keeps the default of
  `true`: it queues onto the session, whose queue fisher#13 made thread-safe for this exact shape.
  - **Fisher was measurably harder to break than Marten, and that is the semaphore's doing rather than
    luck.** Marten reported real corruption (marten#5266 — `Dictionary.TryInsert`,
    `ChangeDetector.DetectChanges`); forcing Fisher back to ten-wide over 15,000 slice applications
    produced no exception at all. So the lock stays: it is what makes the residual window narrow, and
    the declaration is what closes it.
  - **The test asserts the fan-out stopped, not that a crash stopped**, which is the only assertion
    worth making about a data race — a test waiting for corruption is probabilistic in the direction
    that fails you, so green would prove nothing. `slices_are_applied_one_at_a_time` counts concurrent
    `Apply` calls: one with the declaration, **8 measured without it**. The counters live in the test's
    projection rather than in the storage, so production carries no instrumentation.

## Conventions

- Test files and classes are `snake_case` (`appending_events.cs`). CS8981 is suppressed repo-wide.
- xUnit v3 on Microsoft Testing Platform, no VSTest bridge. Test projects need `OutputType=Exe` and
  must not have top-level statements. Pass `TestContext.Current.CancellationToken` to async calls.
- MTP extension packages stay on the **1.x** line — xunit.v3 3.2.2 is built against
  Microsoft.Testing.Platform 1.x and 2.x dies at startup with a `TypeLoadException`.
- **CI runs the test executable directly**, not `dotnet test` — `dotnet test` cannot emit TRX under
  MTP. `--logger "trx;..."` and `-- --report-trx` both run, exit 0, and silently write nothing;
  `--report-trx` is rejected outright by MSBuild. See `.github/workflows/fisher.yml`.
- Mirror Marten's public API surface where it costs nothing; mirror Polecat's internals where the
  concern is not dialect-specific.
- **Raw data access goes through Weasel.Sqlite first** — its data source, its `CommandBuilder`, its
  table definitions and migrations. Deviate only where it cannot express what is needed, comment the
  site, and file the gap upstream so the workaround has something to be removed by. A helper that is
  really "how you do X against SQLite" rather than "how Fisher stores X" should be written to be moved
  into Weasel.Sqlite later. See "Raw data access goes through Weasel.Sqlite first".
- Database execution should go through `StoreOptions.ResiliencePipeline`.
- ⚠️ **A test that builds an async daemon must `await daemon.StopAllAsync()` before disposing it**
  (fisher#189). `IProjectionDaemon` is `IDisposable` only, so `Dispose()` does not await in-flight
  shard work — and a shard's next poll **re-creates the database file the fixture has already
  deleted**. That is how it was found: a full `Fisher.Tests` run left 12 files in the shared temp
  directory, eleven of them from four classes that disposed a daemon without stopping it (the
  twelfth was `db-patch`'s `.drop.sql` companion, which the test that wrote it never deleted). The
  leaked file is the cheap visible symptom; the thing that matters is that a daemon still polling
  after its test finished is doing unpredictable work while other tests run. `scripts/check_no_leaked_databases.py`
  runs in CI after a green suite and holds it at zero — a runner starts with an empty temp
  directory, so the check is exact rather than heuristic.
  - ⚠️ **Locally, pass `--since <epoch>` with the moment the run started** (fisher#345). A developer's
    temp directory is not empty, and both leaks #345 was filed over were files an *earlier* run left
    behind — one of them a run whose net9.0 leg produced no results at all, which is what a test
    process dying mid-run looks like, and a dead process disposes no fixtures. 23 clean full runs
    across both TFMs leaked nothing. A leak reported without `--since` on a dev machine names the
    run that noticed it, not necessarily the one that caused it.
- ⚠️ **ROADMAP's `Status:` line is checked at RELEASE PREP, not on every push** —
  `scripts/check_roadmap_status.py` and `.github/workflows/release-prep.yml` (fisher#265). It is the
  first thing a reader sees, nothing else recomputes it, and it was found stale at two consecutive
  releases on one day: once naming shipped work as pending, once missing an issue filed in between.
  - **It is deliberately not part of `check_scoreboard.py`.** That script reads files on disk and
    runs on every push; this one asks GitHub. On every push it would mean that *anybody filing an
    issue* turns the next contributor's build red for something they did not touch and cannot fix —
    a worse failure than the stale line. The trigger is a pull request touching
    `Directory.Build.props`, which is what release prep always does and nothing else does, so the
    failure lands on the person cutting the release.
  - **The claim about what is open is delimited by `<!-- open-issues -->` markers**, because the
    Status block legitimately discusses *closed* issues — saying what a release finished is half of
    what a status is for, and a naive sweep would reject the current one for naming five. A missing
    marker is a failure rather than a skip.
  - **Both the count word and the enumerated set are checked**, and the difference is reported each
    way. A count alone goes stale silently the moment a *different* issue is open — the same argument
    `check_scoreboard.py` already makes about HANDOFF's red list.
- ⚠️ **A test waiting for the daemon to catch up uses `DaemonWait.Timeout`, never a literal**
  (fisher#329). That covers `WaitForNonStale*`, `RebuildProjectionAsync`, and a post-commit signal. The
  waits already poll until their condition holds (#189), so the ceiling only decides how slow a host may
  be before the test fails. It is 30 s locally and 2 min when `CI=true`, and `FISHER_DAEMON_WAIT_SECONDS`
  overrides both. It used to be a literal 30 s in 37 places, and a two-vCPU hosted runner running the
  test process too occasionally ran out of it. That is how #329 presented: 30.292 s, a hang rather than
  a wrong answer, and the third sighting after #189 and #311. **A test that EXPECTS the wait to time out
  keeps its own short literal**, because scaling it only makes a correct failure take longer.
- **Never call `SqliteConnection.ClearAllPools()`.** It disposes every pooled connection in the
  process, and xUnit runs test collections in parallel — one test's cleanup will take out another
  with `ObjectDisposedException: SQLitePCL.sqlite3`, intermittently enough to look like a flake.
  `TemporaryDatabase.Dispose` clears only its own connection string's pool.

## The documentation site

`docs/` is a [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev) site, published to
[fisher.jasperfx.net](https://fisher.jasperfx.net/) by `.github/workflows/docs.yml`. Set up the way
Polecat's is: same config shape, same sidebar/nav/footer, `vitepress-plugin-llms`, and the aside info
boxes.

```bash
npm install
npm run docs          # mdsnippets + dev server on :5173
npm run docs-build    # mdsnippets + build; a dead internal link fails the build
```

`docs/.vitepress/theme/custom.css` maps the logo's palette — `#2F4739` ground, `#9CBE84` accent,
`#F2F1ED` paper, `#3A3A38` ink, `#4A7343` for links on light — onto VitePress's own tokens **and
nothing else**. Hand-painting the nav bar and the code blocks in the ground colour was tried and
reverted: the nav's background does not span the sidebar column, and a dark code background leaves
the light theme's syntax colours unreadable against it. The file says so, so nobody retries it.

### Documentation samples come from compiled code

**Every code sample a reader would copy lives in a `#region sample_*` in real, compiled source and is
pulled into the markdown by [mdsnippets](https://github.com/SimonCropp/MarkdownSnippets).** A sample
that stops compiling then fails the build, rather than going stale in a page nobody rebuilds. This is
Marten's and Polecat's convention and Fisher follows it.

The mechanics:

- Samples live in `src/Fisher.Tests/Documentation/*_samples.cs`, one file per docs page or area, and
  are compiled by `dotnet build fisher.slnx` like any other test code. `mdsnippets.json` at the repo
  root configures the scan.
- Markdown carries `<!-- snippet: sample_name -->` / `<!-- endSnippet -->`; the tool fills the block
  **in place** and appends a source link back to the file and line on GitHub.
- `mdsnippets` runs as part of both `npm run docs` and `npm run docs-build`, and CI installs
  `MarkdownSnippets.Tool` before building the site. Committing the filled markdown is normal — the
  tool rewrites it either way.
- **Both scripts chain with `&&`, not through `concurrently` as Polecat's do.** Polecat runs
  `concurrently --group mdsnippets "vitepress build docs"`, which starts the fill and the build at the
  same time — so whether a snippet edit reaches the rendered page is a race it happens to win on a
  warm machine. Sequential costs nothing here and removes the question, along with the dependency.

**What stays an inline fence**, deliberately:

- Single-expression fragments shown in a list, where the surrounding method would be noise —
  `.Where(x => x.MaybeDeleted())` in the LINQ operator tables is the archetype.
- SQL, shell, and rendered DDL. There is nothing to compile.
- A contract Fisher does not own, quoted to show its shape.

**A contract Fisher *does* own is snipped from the real source file**, not retyped. `src/Fisher` is in
the mdsnippets scan for exactly this: put a `#region sample_*` around the interface and reference it,
so an interface that gains a member cannot silently disagree with the page that documents it. That is
the case where inline quoting rots most quietly, because nothing fails.

**This is worth more than it looks.** The first sample converted — the getting-started event round
trip — did not compile: `StartStream` returns a `StreamAction`, not the stream's `Guid`, and the
hand-written version had been copied into five more pages and the README before anything checked it.
That is the whole argument for the convention, and it was found within a minute of turning it on.

## Related codebases

### Repository layout

`src/Fisher` is the store. `src/Fisher.AspNetCore` and `src/Fisher.EntityFrameworkCore` are the
companion packages, each with its own test project; `Fisher.Tests` covers the core. All six build for
both TFMs and `dotnet test fisher.slnx` runs all of them.

| Codebase | Path | Use |
|---|---|---|
| Polecat | `~/code/polecat` | **The closest template** — SQL Server sibling; mirror its structure |
| Marten | `~/code/marten` | PostgreSQL reference implementation |
| Weasel | `~/code/weasel` | `Weasel.Sqlite` + `Weasel.Storage` sources |
| JasperFx | `~/code/jasperfx` | Core + Events framework (local clone may lag the pinned package) |
