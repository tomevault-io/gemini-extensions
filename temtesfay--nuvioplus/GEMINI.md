# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Build Commands

```bash
# Android debug APK
./gradlew :composeApp:assembleDebug

# Run on connected device/simulator (wrapper script)
./scripts/run-mobile.sh android
./scripts/run-mobile.sh ios

# iOS IPA (release) — open Xcode, Product → Archive, then Distribute
# Or via xcodebuild:
xcodebuild -workspace iosApp/iosApp.xcworkspace -scheme iosApp -configuration Release archive

# Run a single Gradle test
./gradlew :composeApp:testDebugUnitTest --tests "com.nuvio.app.SomeTest"
```

## Required: local.properties

The Gradle build runs `GenerateRuntimeConfigsTask` (in `composeApp/build.gradle.kts`) that reads `local.properties` and generates Kotlin config objects at build time. Without these keys the build will fail:

```
sdk.dir=/path/to/android/sdk
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
# Optional (needed for Trakt integration):
TRAKT_CLIENT_ID=...
TRAKT_CLIENT_SECRET=...
# Optional (needed for intro-skip DB):
INTRO_DB_URL=...
INTRO_DB_KEY=...
```

Generated files land in `composeApp/build/generated/` and are gitignored.

## Architecture Overview

**Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) + Compose Multiplatform.** Shared UI and business logic live in `composeApp/`, native iOS glue in `iosApp/`.

### Source Sets

```
composeApp/src/
  commonMain/   — shared UI (Compose), ViewModels, repositories, domain logic
  androidMain/  — Android actual implementations (DataStore, ExoPlayer surface, etc.)
  iosMain/      — iOS actual implementations (NSUserDefaults, MPV bridge calls)

iosApp/iosApp/  — Swift/UIKit host: app entry, native tab bar, player bridge
```

### expect/actual Pattern

Platform-specific behaviour is declared with `expect` in `commonMain` and implemented with `actual` in `androidMain`/`iosMain`. Key examples:

- `PlayerEngine.kt` declares `expect fun PlatformPlayerSurface(...)` — iOS actual wraps `MPVPlayerViewController`
- `PlayerSettingsStorage.kt` declares `expect` CRUD for all settings — iOS actual uses `NSUserDefaults` with profile-scoped keys

### Feature & Core Packages

```
commonMain/kotlin/com/nuvio/app/
  features/
    player/     — PlayerEngine, SubtitleModal, SubtitleStylePanel, PlayerSettingsRepository/Storage
    profiles/   — ProfileRepository (activeProfileId, ProfileScopedKey)
    browse/     — content browsing
    settings/   — app-wide settings
    …
  core/
    …
```

### iOS Bridge Pattern

`iosApp/iosApp/Player/` contains the native Swift player implementation. Before Compose initialises, `NuvioPlayerRegistration.register()` is called (in `ContentView.swift → makeUIViewController`) which registers the Swift factory with the KMP side. KMP then calls through the registered `NuvioPlayerBridgeFactory` when it needs a native player view.

Entry-point chain: `iOSApp.swift → ContentView → ComposeView → RootComposeViewController → MainViewController (KMP)`.

## Player / Subtitle System

### MPV on iOS

The iOS player uses **MPVKit** (libmpv via Metal/MoltenVK). Key property used for subtitle rendering: `sub-ass-override=strip` puts libmpv into plain-text mode.

**MPVKit font limitation:** `sub-font` / `osd-font` properties are silently ignored by the bundled renderer — no font loading. Rounded corners are also impossible in libmpv.

### UIKit Subtitle Overlay

To support custom fonts and rounded-corner backgrounds, `MPVPlayerBridge.swift` includes a UIKit overlay that **replaces** MPV's subtitle rendering when needed:

- Overlay activates when `bgAlpha > 0.01 || hasCustomFont` (hasCustomFont = font family is not empty and not `"sans-serif"`)
- When active: sets `sub-visibility = no`, renders text via `UILabel` over a `UIView` with `cornerRadius = 6`
- Subtitle text is driven by `mpv_observe_property(mpv, 0, "sub-text", MPV_FORMAT_STRING)` — polled via `getString("sub-text")` on the event queue thread, dispatched to main for UI update
- Font mapping: `Menlo*` → `UIFont.monospacedSystemFont` (SF Mono), `Georgia*` → `UIFont(name: "Georgia[-Bold]")`, everything else → `UIFont.systemFont` (SF Pro)
- Font size: KMP sends `fontSizeSp * 3` to MPV; UIKit overlay reverses with `CGFloat(fontSize) / 3.0`
- Bottom position: `bottomInset = CGFloat(24 + max(0, 100 - subPos) * 2)` — maps `sub-pos` (default 90) to ~44 pt above safe-area bottom

### Settings Persistence

All settings repositories are **object singletons** with `MutableStateFlow<UiState>`, `ensureLoaded()` for lazy disk reads, and `onProfileChanged()` for profile switching.

**Profile-scoped keys:** Every NSUserDefaults key is suffixed with `_${activeProfileId}` (default `_1`) via `ProfileScopedKey.of(key)`.

**Cloud sync protocol — critical pattern:** `exportToSyncPayload` serialises settings to a map; `replaceFromSyncPayload` **deletes all keys in `syncKeys`** then restores from the payload. If a setting is added to `syncKeys` but not added to both `exportToSyncPayload` AND `replaceFromSyncPayload`, it will be **wiped on every sync**. When adding new settings fields, always update all four locations:
1. `syncKeys` list
2. `exportToSyncPayload()`
3. `replaceFromSyncPayload()`
4. Both `PlayerSettingsStorage.android.kt` and `PlayerSettingsStorage.ios.kt`

### MPV Color Format

libmpv uses `#AARRGGBB` (alpha first, not last). `00` = transparent, `FF` = opaque. Helpers in `MPVPlayerBridge.swift`: `uiColorRGB(hex:)` for `#RRGGBB`, `uiColorAARRGGBB(hex:)` for MPV format, `overlayAlpha(fromAARRGGBB:)` to extract alpha byte.

### Hero Trailer Pre-Warming

Three-stage pipeline to minimise first-play latency on the home screen hero carousel:

**Stage 1 — AVFoundation pre-warm** (`NuvioHeroPlayerBridge.swift`):
`NuvioHeroPlayerRegistration.register()` (called at app startup before Compose) calls `prewarmAVFoundation()`, which creates and immediately releases a silent `AVPlayer` on a background thread. This forces AVFoundation, VideoToolbox, and CoreMedia to initialise during the profile selection screen rather than during the first bridge creation. Effect: "Bridge ready" drops from ~1900 ms (cold process) to ~100–200 ms for the first hero slide.

**Stage 2 — Slide 0 early YouTube extraction** (`HomeRepository.enrichHeroTrailers`):
As soon as slide 0's TMDB/Stremio keys are resolved, its YouTube URL extraction starts immediately in the stable repository scope — without waiting for the other 7 hero items to finish enrichment. Slides 1–7 pre-warm after `awaitAll()`. Saves 0.5–2 s depending on how staggered TMDB responses are. Tracked by `slide0EarlyPreWarmJob: Job?`; cancelled in `clear()` and whenever `publishCurrentState` detects a new hero-item set to prevent stale trailer data from a previous profile being written into `_trailerSources`.

**Stage 3 — AVURLAsset manifest pre-buffering** (`HeroTrailerPreBufferCache.swift`):
`TrailerPreBufferService.prefetch()` is called as each URL is extracted. It creates an `AVURLAsset` and calls `loadValuesAsynchronously(forKeys: ["playable"])` to download the HLS manifest. When the bridge is later created, `makeItem(videoUrl:)` returns an `AVPlayerItem` from the cached asset, skipping the manifest round-trip (~150–300 ms). The asset is retained so swiping back to a slide is equally fast.

## Mac Catalyst (macOS)

The iOS app ships as a Mac Catalyst target (`macabi` slice). Platform detection and all Mac-specific behaviour is gated on `isMacCatalyst`.

### Platform Detection

```kotlin
// commonMain/kotlin/com/nuvio/app/Platform.kt
internal expect val isMacCatalyst: Boolean

// iosMain — true when running as Mac Catalyst
internal actual val isMacCatalyst: Boolean = NSProcessInfo.processInfo.macCatalystApp

// androidMain — always false
internal actual val isMacCatalyst: Boolean = false
```

Swift side uses `#if targetEnvironment(macCatalyst)` compile-time guards.

### Cursor Auto-Hide (Player)

`MPVPlayerViewController` in `MPVPlayerBridge.swift` hides the system cursor after 2.5 s of inactivity and restores it on any mouse movement.

**Key design decisions:**
- **`UIHoverGestureRecognizer` is intentionally NOT used.** UIKit stops delivering hover events to gesture recognizers once the cursor is hidden. That makes the re-show path unreachable: the cursor hides, the user moves the mouse (macOS shows it via `setHiddenUntilMouseMoves` semantics), but no `.changed` event fires, so the timer never resets and the cursor stays visible forever after the first shake. The notification to show Kotlin player controls is also never posted.
- Instead, an **AppKit `NSEvent` local monitor** is registered (via the ObjC runtime) for `NSEventMaskMouseMoved | NSEventMaskLeftMouseDragged | NSEventMaskRightMouseDragged` (mask = `32 | 64 | 128`). Local monitors fire at the app's event-loop level, unconditionally, regardless of cursor visibility or which UIKit view is on top.
- Cursor hiding uses `NSCursor.setHiddenUntilMouseMoves(true/false)`. **`perform:with:` must NOT be used** — it fails to pass a primitive `BOOL` correctly. Instead, `class_getClassMethod` + `method_getImplementation` + `unsafeBitCast` to a C function pointer is used to call the method with the correct calling convention.
- The monitor token is stored in `mouseMovedMonitor: AnyObject?` and removed via `NSEvent.removeMonitor:` on teardown (`viewWillDisappear` / `destroyPlayer`).

When the cursor moves, Swift posts `"NuvioPlayerShowControls"` via `NotificationCenter`. On the Kotlin side, `WatchForMacCursorShowControls` (in `PlayerPlatformEffects.kt`) listens for this notification and sets `controlsVisible = true` in `PlayerScreen`, making the player overlay reappear.

```kotlin
// commonMain — expect declaration
@Composable expect fun WatchForMacCursorShowControls(onShow: () -> Unit)

// iosMain — actual registers NSNotificationCenter observer (Mac Catalyst only)
@Composable
actual fun WatchForMacCursorShowControls(onShow: () -> Unit) {
    if (!NSProcessInfo.processInfo.macCatalystApp) return
    val onShowState = rememberUpdatedState(onShow)
    DisposableEffect(Unit) {
        val observer = NSNotificationCenter.defaultCenter.addObserverForName(
            name = "NuvioPlayerShowControls", `object` = null,
            queue = NSOperationQueue.mainQueue,
        ) { _ -> onShowState.value() }
        onDispose { NSNotificationCenter.defaultCenter.removeObserver(observer) }
    }
}
```

Called in `PlayerScreen.kt` as:
```kotlin
WatchForMacCursorShowControls(onShow = {
    if (!playerControlsLocked) controlsVisible = true
})
```

### Trackpad / Mouse-Wheel Scrolling

Compose Multiplatform defaults `UIPanGestureRecognizer.allowedScrollTypesMask` to `.touch`, which rejects trackpad (`.continuous`) and mouse-wheel (`.discrete`) events on Mac Catalyst.

`ContentView.patchScrollViews(in:)` recursively walks the view tree and sets `allowedScrollTypesMask = [.continuous, .discrete]` on every `UIScrollView.panGestureRecognizer` and standalone `UIPanGestureRecognizer`. Because Compose creates gesture recognizers lazily (new screens, lazy lists, in-app navigation), a persistent `Timer` fires every 1 s for the app's lifetime to re-patch any newly created recognizers.

```swift
// ContentView.configureMacWindow()
scene.windows.forEach { patchScrollViews(in: $0) }
Timer.scheduledTimer(withTimeInterval: 1.0, repeats: true) { [weak scene] _ in
    scene?.windows.forEach { patchScrollViews(in: $0) }
}
```

**Deceleration rate:** `patchScrollViews` unconditionally sets `scrollView.decelerationRate` to `0.9992` on every pass — higher than the UIKit default (`.normal` = `0.998`) to give more scroll momentum so lists coast further after a swipe, matching native macOS feel. The value is always overwritten (not guarded by a `<` check) because Compose can reset it to a lower value when it recycles its scroll containers.

**Profile avatar caching:** `refreshProfileAvatarImageIfNeeded()` in `RootComposeViewController` uses `URLRequest(cachePolicy: .returnCacheDataElseLoad)` so `NSURLCache` serves the avatar image from disk on every launch after the first. The tab-bar profile icon appears instantly instead of waiting for a network round-trip.

### Landscape Poster Size

On Mac Catalyst, landscape posters are scaled ×1.5 to better fit the larger screen:

```kotlin
// PosterCardDimensions.kt
internal fun landscapePosterWidth(basePosterWidthDp: Int): Dp =
    (basePosterWidthDp * PosterLandscapeWidthScale * if (isMacCatalyst) 1.5f else 1.0f).dp
```

### MPV Player — Mac Catalyst Differences

| Setting | iOS | Mac Catalyst |
|---|---|---|
| `hwdec` | `auto` | `videotoolbox` (MoltenVK doesn't support VK_KHR_video_decode_queue) |
| `vulkan-swap-mode` | `fifo` | `mailbox` |
| `vulkan-queue-count` | `1` | default |
| `vulkan-async-compute/transfer` | `no` | `no` |
| `framebufferOnly` | `true` | `false` (MoltenVK needs framebuffer read access) |
| EDR (`wantsExtendedDynamicRangeContent`) | `true` | `false` (MoltenVK + EDR causes drawable failures on SDR displays) |

**Audio session:** `AVAudioSession` must be activated (`.playback` / `.moviePlayback`) in `applicationDidFinishLaunchingWithOptions` **before** any player code, not in `viewDidLoad`. AudioUnit initialises on a background thread and queries `AVAudioSession.outputNumberOfChannels` — if the session isn't active yet it returns 0, causing an indefinite hang. This is done in `OrientationLockAppDelegate`.

**MetalLayer EDR setter:** MoltenVK calls `wantsExtendedDynamicRangeContent` from its render thread. On Mac Catalyst the setter is a no-op on background threads (silently dropped) to avoid a deadlock: MoltenVK render thread → main thread → CoreAnimation drawable-lock → deadlock.

### Orientation

On Mac Catalyst, `OrientationLockCoordinator.supportedOrientations` returns `.all` and `requestOrientationUpdate` is a no-op (macOS manages window sizing). The compile-time `#if targetEnvironment(macCatalyst)` guards in `OrientationLockAppDelegate.application(_:supportedInterfaceOrientationsFor:)` enforce this.

## Version Management (iOS)

`iosApp/Configuration/Version.xcconfig` is the single source of truth for iOS version numbers:

```
MARKETING_VERSION = 0.1.x
CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION = N
```

Bump both when releasing. The xcconfig feeds `CFBundleShortVersionString` and `CFBundleVersion` in the Info.plist.
