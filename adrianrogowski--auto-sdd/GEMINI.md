# Spec-Driven Development (SDD)

This project uses a spec-driven development workflow. Follow these rules in all interactions.

> **Command files**: `.cursor/commands/` is the canonical source for all slash commands. `.claude/commands/` is generated from it by `./scripts/sync-commands.sh` (real copies, not symlinks — Claude Code's command discovery doesn't reliably follow symlinks). To change a command, edit it in `.cursor/commands/` and run the sync script. Never edit `.claude/commands/` directly.

## Core Principle

**Spec before code.** Define behavior before implementing it.

```
Project setup (once):
  /strategy → /vision → /personas → /constitution → /design-tokens

GTM pipeline (from strategy):
  /strategy (Phase 5: GTM sketch) → /gtm (full playbook) → /find-early-users (prospect list)

Finding product-market fit (iterate before building):
  /strategy → /gtm → /find-early-users → talk to people → /strategy (update) → repeat
      ↓ (once stable)
  /vision → /personas → /roadmap → /build-next

Per feature (Red-Green-Refactor TDD):

## Project Setup (Once)

These are created once and inform every feature. Each reads the output of the commands above it:

```
/strategy        → .specs/strategy.md          (business positioning + model + GTM sketch)
    ↓
    ├──▶ /vision          → .specs/vision.md            (reads strategy)
    │       ↓
    │    /personas        → .specs/personas/*.md        (reads strategy + vision)
    │       ↓
    │    /constitution    → .specs/constitution.md      (reads strategy + vision)
    │       ↓
    │    /design-tokens   → .specs/design-system/       (reads vision + personas)
    │
    └──▶ /gtm             → .specs/gtm.md               (reads strategy → channels, templates, timeline)
            ↓
         /find-early-users → .specs/gtm/prospects.md    (reads strategy + gtm → specific people)
```

| Command | Creates | Purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `/strategy` | `.specs/strategy.md` | Business strategy: target customer, buying motion, value prop, success metrics, GTM sketch |
| `/vision` | `.specs/vision.md` | App purpose, users, tech stack, design principles |
| `/personas` | `.specs/personas/*.md` | Who uses this (vocabulary, patience, frustrations) |
| `/constitution` | `.specs/constitution.md` | Non-negotiable constraints: security, data handling, error patterns |
| `/design-tokens` | `.specs/design-system/` (DESIGN.md, tokens.md, preview.html) | Personality-driven system from vision + personas + archetype references |
| `/gtm` | `.specs/gtm.md` | GTM playbook: channels, outreach templates, launch timeline |
| `/find-early-users` | `.specs/gtm/prospects.md` | Specific people + conversations to reach out to now |

All are optional but improve every spec. `/spec-first` will note what's missing.

### Ordering: GTM vs Vision

The setup commands branch from strategy in parallel — both `/vision` and `/gtm` read strategy.md. But the **temporal order** depends on your situation:

**Finding product-market fit** (greenfield, unvalidated idea): GTM before vision. Use `/gtm` and `/find-early-users` to validate the problem with real people. Iterate on `/strategy` until it stabilizes. *Then* write `/vision` grounded in what you learned.

**Known product** (cloning an app, internal tool, experienced domain): Vision first. You already know what to build — go straight to `/vision`, then use `/gtm` to figure out distribution.

```
PMF search:    /strategy → /gtm → /find-early-users → conversations → /strategy (update)
                   ↓ (once stable)
               /vision → /personas → /roadmap → build

Known product: /strategy → /vision → /personas → /roadmap → build
                   └──────→ /gtm → /find-early-users (in parallel)
```

---

## Strategy

Business strategy lives in `.specs/strategy.md` and is read by `/vision`, `/personas`, `/roadmap`, and `/spec-first`.

**What it contains:**
- **Problem** — what pain exists, who has it, how they cope today
- **Target customer** — specific segment, who pays, anti-segment
- **Buying motion** — bottom-up PLG, top-down enterprise, self-serve, or hybrid
- **Value proposition** — the one-liner, aha moment, time-to-value
- **Differentiation** — why this vs existing solutions
- **Business model** — revenue model, price intuition, expansion path
- **Success metrics** — what to measure at 1, 6, and 12 months
- **Anti-goals** — what we're explicitly NOT building

**How it's used:**
- `/vision` reads strategy to ground the product description in business decisions
- `/personas` reads strategy to determine who the personas are (target segment → primary persona)
- `/roadmap` reads strategy to prioritize features by business value and buying motion fit
- `/spec-first` reads strategy and adds a Strategy Alignment section to every spec
- `/constitution` reads strategy to determine constraint weight (enterprise = heavier security)

Strategy is optional. Projects without it (internal tools, prototypes, learning exercises) skip directly to `/vision`.

---

## GTM Pipeline

Go-to-market planning flows from strategy through increasingly concrete steps:

```
/strategy (Phase 5: GTM Sketch — automatic, lightweight)
    ↓
/gtm → .specs/gtm.md (full playbook: channels, templates, timeline)
    ↓
/find-early-users → .specs/gtm/prospects.md (specific people + draft messages)
```

**`/gtm`** reads strategy.md and uses WebSearch to find specific channels, communities, and content opportunities. Outputs a prioritized channel map, outreach templates (community post, cold DM, feedback request), and a 30-day launch timeline.

**`/find-early-users`** reads strategy.md (and optionally gtm.md) and searches the live web for people who are publicly expressing the problem you're solving. Outputs a scored prospect list with links, pain signals, and personalized draft messages.

Both commands use WebSearch for real-time research — results are current, not generic advice.

---

## Constitution

Project-wide invariants live in `.specs/constitution.md` and are read by `/spec-first`.

**What it contains:**
- Non-negotiable security, data handling, API, error handling, and dependency rules
- Rules are verifiable (an agent can check compliance), not vague aspirations
- Tailored to the project's tech stack and strategy — generated by `/constitution`, not copied from a template

**How it's used:**
- `/spec-first` reads the constitution and adds a **Constitutional Compliance** section to every spec
- Each spec must mark which rules apply, which are N/A, and flag any that can't be satisfied
- `/constitution --audit` scans all specs for compliance sections

Constitution is optional but recommended for any project intended for real users.

---

## Personas

User personas live in `.specs/personas/` and are loaded before every spec.

**What they contain:**
- **Context** — how the user spends their day, devices, technical level
- **Vocabulary** — their words vs developer words → drives all UI labels
- **Patience level** — Very Low / Low / Medium / High → drives flow length
- **Frustrations** — patterns to avoid
- **Success metric** — how they measure if the app works

**How they're used:**

**Before writing**: Loads persona vocabulary, patience level, and frustrations. This shapes the Gherkin scenarios, mockup labels, and flow complexity from the start.

**After writing**: Re-reads the spec through each persona's eyes. Revises vocabulary, simplifies flows, cuts anti-persona features. Reports what changed at the pause point.

### Creating Personas

Run `/personas` or they're auto-suggested on first `/spec-first` run. Most projects need 2:
- **Primary**: The main user. Every feature must work for them.
- **Anti-persona**: Who you're NOT building for. Prevents scope creep.

---

## Design System

Three project outputs, created by `/design-tokens`:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.specs/design-system/DESIGN.md` | Google DESIGN.md spec — agents read before UI work |
| `.specs/design-system/tokens.md` | Shorthand for specs and ASCII mockups |
| `.specs/design-system/preview.html` | Visual showcase — open in browser |

Archetype references: `.specs/design-system/references/*.design.md`  
Optional inspiration: [getdesign.md](https://getdesign.md/) via `npx getdesign@latest add {brand}`

### How It Works

`/design-tokens` doesn't stamp a generic template. It:
1. Reads strategy, vision, and personas
2. Reads matching archetype reference for structure and depth
3. Determines personality and derives palette from brand + context
4. Writes DESIGN.md + tokens.md + preview.html with project-specific values
5. Validates with `npx @google/design.md lint` when available

### For Agents

Read **DESIGN.md** before UI (YAML tokens, component variants, Do's/Don'ts). Use **tokens.md** in feature specs and mockups.

### When `/spec-first` Runs on Greenfield

If no design system exists:
1. Auto-create via `/design-tokens` flow (reads whatever context exists)
2. Create `.cursor/rules/design-tokens.mdc` cursor rule
3. Proceed with feature spec

### When a Spec References New Components

If ASCII mockup references a component that doesn't exist in `.specs/design-system/components/`:
1. Auto-create a **stub** file: `.specs/design-system/components/{component}.md`
2. Stub includes: name, purpose, "pending implementation" status
3. After implementation, stub gets filled in (manually or via `/document-component`)

### Design System Maintenance

`.specs/design-system/DESIGN.md` is the source of truth for agents. When tokens change:
1. Update DESIGN.md
2. Sync tokens.md and regenerate preview.html (`/design-tokens preview`)
3. Update `.cursor/rules/design-tokens.mdc` if token names changed

---

## When Implementing Features

### /spec-first: Create vs Update

`/spec-first` automatically detects whether to create or update:

1. **Resolve spec**: Search `.specs/features/**/*.feature.md` for a spec matching the feature name (by path or frontmatter `feature:`)
2. **If match found** → UPDATE mode: revise scenarios and mockup, preserve status/tests/components. With `--full`, continues through tests → implement → compound → commit
3. **If no match** → CREATE mode: load personas + tokens, create new spec with Gherkin + ASCII mockup + user journey, revise through persona lens

**Specs are state, not deltas.** In both modes the spec describes the entire expected behavior of the feature as it exists now — "add three fields to the form" is a commit message, not a spec. UPDATE mode rewrites affected scenarios to the new truth (removing superseded ones) rather than appending change notes; the delta lives in git history and the pause-point summary.

### What happens in the SPEC step:

1. **Load context** — Read strategy, constitution, personas, design tokens, learnings index
2. **Write Gherkin** — Scenarios using persona vocabulary, matching patience level
3. **Write technical design** — Data model, API contracts, state management, key dependencies, program design (files, signatures, call stack), implementation slices (bridges WHAT→HOW)
4. **Write mockup** — ASCII art referencing design tokens
5. **Add strategy alignment** — How this feature supports the business strategy (if strategy.md exists)
6. **Add constitutional compliance** — Which constraints apply and how they're addressed (if constitution.md exists)
7. **Add user journey** — Where this feature fits in the user's flow
8. **Persona revision** — Re-read through persona's eyes, revise, note changes
9. **Create component stubs** — For any new UI components
10. **Pause** — Show spec + revision notes, ask "Run `/tdd` when ready"

### What happens in the /tdd step (Red-Green-Refactor):

1. **RED** — Write failing tests from Gherkin scenarios + Technical Design
2. **GREEN** — Implement vertical slice by vertical slice until all tests pass, verifying and committing each slice (track failure signals: test retries, build failures)
3. **Drift Check L1** — Self-check spec vs code alignment, including Program Design vs actual structure (track drift as failure signal)
4. **REFACTOR** — Clean up code, tests must still pass
5. **Drift Check L1b** — Re-verify after refactoring (track drift as failure signal)
6. **COMPOUND** — Always runs. Extracts learnings AND failure signals (drift, retries, spec gaps, corrections)

### For New Features
1. Run `/spec-first {feature}` — it will CREATE a spec if none exists
2. Loads strategy, constitution, personas, design tokens, and learnings before writing
3. Writes Gherkin using persona vocabulary
4. Creates ASCII mockup referencing design tokens
5. Adds strategy alignment and constitutional compliance (if those files exist)
6. Adds user journey (where this feature fits in the flow)
7. Runs persona revision pass, notes changes
8. **STOP for approval** — "Run `/tdd` when ready" (unless `--full`)
8. Run `/tdd` — full Red-Green-Refactor cycle:
   - RED: Write failing tests
   - GREEN: Implement until tests pass
   - Drift check (Layer 1)
   - REFACTOR: Clean up code, tests must still pass
   - Drift check (Layer 1b)
   - Compound: Extract learnings
9. Fill in component documentation

### For Existing Features
1. Run `/spec-first {feature}` — it will UPDATE the spec if one exists
2. Or read the spec first and update manually if behavior changes
3. Update tests to match
4. Update `.specs/mapping.md` (or run `./scripts/generate-mapping.sh`)

### For Bug Fixes
1. Check if spec defines expected behavior
2. If gap found, add scenario to spec
3. Write failing test that reproduces bug
4. Fix the bug
5. Document the new test

### Documenting an Existing Codebase

For documenting a codebase that was built without specs, use the doc-loop workflow:

```
/spec-init                              # Discovery only: creates doc-queue.md
  ↓ (review the queue)
./scripts/doc-loop-local.sh --continue  # Processes queue with fresh agent per item
```

Or headless (discovery + processing in one go):
```
./scripts/doc-loop-local.sh             # Does its own discovery, then loops
```

**Philosophy: Document, don't fix.**
- Tests are written to pass against current code (documenting reality)
- If tests fail after one retry, log the finding and move on
- Pre-existing test failures are recorded as baseline, not fixed
- Source code is never modified during documentation

**How it works:**
1. **Discovery**: Scans codebase, groups files by domain, creates `.specs/doc-queue.md`
2. **Doc loop**: For each queue item, spawns a fresh agent that runs `/document-code` in batch mode
3. **Verification**: Runs test suite, reports final coverage

Each queue item gets a fresh agent context, so quality stays consistent even for large codebases. Progress is committed periodically and the queue tracks status, so you can resume with `--continue` if interrupted.

**Key files:**
- `.specs/doc-queue.md` — Ordered list of items to document (automation parses this)
- `.specs/codebase-summary.md` — Project overview + baseline status
- `.specs/needs-review.md` — Items that couldn't be fully documented

---

## Pause Triggers

If the user says any of these (or similar), create the spec and **STOP** - wait for approval:
- "let me review first"
- "write the spec first"
- "show me the Gherkin"
- "spec this out"
- "don't implement yet"
- "plan this first"
- "what would this look like?"
- "before you implement..."
- "hold on"
- "wait"
- "let me see"

After showing spec: "Does this look right? Run `/tdd` when ready, or say 'go ahead' to start the Red-Green-Refactor cycle."

## Parallel Builds

`BRANCH_STRATEGY=parallel` enables concurrent feature builds in separate git worktrees.
Each worker runs the same pipeline as sequential mode (spec → implement → verify → refactor),
then features merge to an integration branch with post-merge drift check + compound.

```
main ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  │           │           │
  ├── wt-a/  ├── wt-b/  ├── wt-c/          ← worktrees
  │   spec   │   spec   │   spec            ← concurrent agents
  │   impl   │   impl   │   impl
  │   verify │   verify │   verify (build+test)
  │   refac  │   refac  │   fail✗
  │   done✓  │   done✓  │
  └───────────┴───────────┘
              │
        merge each (roadmap order, sequential)
         ├── build + test verify
         ├── drift check (Layer 2)
         ├── compound (learnings)
         └── mark ✅
              │
        integration branch
```

Configuration in `.env.local`:
```bash
BRANCH_STRATEGY=parallel
PARALLEL_FEATURES=3          # max concurrent agents
REBUILD_ON_CONFLICT=true     # rebuild unmergeable features on integrated code
MERGE_MODEL=                 # model for merge-resolution agent (default: AGENT_MODEL)
```

Merge conflict resolution (in order):
1. **Deterministic rules** for known shared files:
   - `mapping.md` and `roadmap.md`: integration branch's copy wins (mapping is regenerated after merge; roadmap status is orchestrator-owned and committed immediately so the integration tree stays clean between merges)
   - `.specs/learnings/*`: line-level union merge (both sides kept; also covered by `.gitattributes merge=union`)
   - `package.json`: three-way JSON union (dependencies/scripts from both sides), lockfile regenerated afterward
2. **Merge-resolution agent** for source-file conflicts: a fresh agent (MERGE_MODEL) edits the conflicted files in place mid-merge, producing a semantic union of both features. The post-merge build/test/drift gates validate the result and revert to the pre-merge commit if it is wrong.
3. **Rebuild pass** for anything still failing: the feature is rebuilt sequentially in a fresh worktree forked from the current integration branch (so the agent implements against the already-integrated code), then merged again. Only if the rebuild also fails is the feature marked ⏸️ blocked with its branch preserved.

Parallel workers do NOT touch shared files (`mapping.md`, `roadmap.md`, `learnings/*`) — the merge phase owns them. The ready-feature list is re-parsed before every batch, so features whose dependencies completed in an earlier batch are picked up in the same run. Drift check catches semantic conflicts that merge cleanly but break spec alignment.

## Subagent Patterns

When executing SDD commands, use subagents to parallelize independent work.

### When to Fan Out

| Command | What to parallelize |
|---------|-------------------|
| `/spec-first` | Load strategy, constitution, personas, design tokens, learnings, and search for existing spec simultaneously |
| `/tdd` | Post-GREEN: run build check, lint check, and test check simultaneously |
| `/build-next` | Context loading: read strategy, vision, personas, constitution, tokens, related specs, learnings in parallel |
| `/check-coverage` | Check spec coverage, test coverage, and mapping consistency independently |
| `/catch-drift` | Batch 3-5 specs per subagent instead of one at a time |
| `/guide` | Read all feature specs, codebase files, and learnings in parallel batches |
| `/ralph-run` | Pre-flight: validate CLI, check ports, read roadmap simultaneously |

### When NOT to Fan Out

- **Sequential dependencies**: Spec must complete before tests, tests before implementation
- **Git operations**: Only one agent should touch git at a time
- **Roadmap updates**: Single writer to avoid race conditions on roadmap.md
- **Small tasks**: If total work is < 10 seconds, the overhead isn't worth it

### Patterns

**Parallel Reads Then Sequential Write:**
1. Fan out: read strategy, constitution, personas, tokens, learnings, existing specs simultaneously
2. Collect results
3. Sequential: write the spec using all gathered context

**Parallel Validation:**
1. Agent completes implementation
2. Fan out: run tests, build, lint simultaneously
3. If all pass → continue. If any fail → fix sequentially (failures may be related)

**Batch Processing** (drift-scan, doc-loop, check-coverage):
1. Gather list of items
2. Chunk into batches of PARALLEL_FEATURES (default: 3)
3. Fan out: one subagent per chunk
4. Collect and merge results

`BRANCH_STRATEGY=parallel` handles script-level parallelism (multiple agent processes in worktrees). Within each agent process, use the patterns above for command-level parallelism.

## Test ID Conventions

| Prefix | Component/Module |
|--------|------------------|
| UT | utils |
| API | api handlers |
| SVC | services |
| CMP | components |
| PG | pages |
| HK | hooks |

---

## Always Mention

When working with specs, always tell the user:
- Which spec files you're reading/creating/updating
- Which persona files you're reading
- Which design system files you're referencing
- Any gaps between specs and tests
- Component stubs that need documentation

---

## File Locations

| Type | Location |
|------|----------|
| Business strategy | `.specs/strategy.md` |
| Project constitution | `.specs/constitution.md` |
| Migration playbook | `.specs/migrations.md` |
| App vision | `.specs/vision.md` |
| Build roadmap | `.specs/roadmap.md` |
| User personas | `.specs/personas/*.md` |
| GTM playbook | `.specs/gtm.md` |
| Prospect list | `.specs/gtm/prospects.md` |
| Feature specs | `.specs/features/{domain}/{feature}.feature.md` |
| Test suite docs | `.specs/test-suites/{mirrors test dir}` |
| Design tokens | `.specs/design-system/tokens.md` |
| Component docs | `.specs/design-system/components/{name}.md` |
| Mapping | `.specs/mapping.md` (auto-generated) |
| Documentation queue | `.specs/doc-queue.md` (created by `/spec-init` or `doc-loop-local.sh`) |
| Cross-cutting learnings | `.specs/learnings/` (by category) |

---

## Mapping File

The `.specs/mapping.md` file is **auto-generated** from feature spec YAML frontmatter.

**Do not edit mapping.md directly.** Instead:
1. Update the feature spec's YAML frontmatter
2. The Cursor hook will regenerate mapping.md automatically
3. Or run `./scripts/generate-mapping.sh` manually

### Feature Spec Frontmatter

Every feature spec should have YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
feature: Feature Name
domain: domain-name
source: path/to/source.tsx
tests:
  - path/to/test.ts
components:
  - ComponentName
design_refs:
  - tokens.md
personas:
  - primary
  - anti-persona
status: stub | specced | tested | implemented
created: YYYY-MM-DD
updated: YYYY-MM-DD
---
```

---

## Learnings

Cross-cutting learnings are stored in `.specs/learnings/` by category:

| Category | File |
|----------|------|
| Testing | `.specs/learnings/testing.md` |
| Performance | `.specs/learnings/performance.md` |
| Security | `.specs/learnings/security.md` |
| API & Data | `.specs/learnings/api.md` |
| Design System | `.specs/learnings/design.md` |
| General | `.specs/learnings/general.md` |

Read `.specs/learnings/index.md` for a summary, recent learnings, and recent failure signals.

Feature-specific learnings are in each spec's `## Learnings` section.

`/compound` runs automatically at the end of every `/tdd` cycle. It captures both success patterns AND failure signals (drift caught, test retries, human corrections, spec gaps). Failure signals include root cause and a "fix for future" directive to prevent recurrence.

---

## Roadmap System

For building entire apps, use the roadmap system:

### vision.md

High-level app description:
- What the app does
- Target users
- Key screens
- Tech stack

Created by `/vision` (from description, Jira, or Confluence) or `/clone-app <url>` (from a live app).

### roadmap.md

Ordered list of features with dependencies and status:

```markdown
| # | Feature | Source | Jira | Complexity | Deps | Status |
|---|---------|--------|------|------------|------|--------|
| 1 | Auth: Signup | clone-app | PROJ-101 | M | - | ✅ |
| 2 | Dashboard | clone-app | PROJ-102 | L | 1 | ⬜ |
```

Status symbols:
- ⬜ Pending
- 🔄 In Progress
- ✅ Completed
- ⏸️ Blocked
- ❌ Cancelled

### Building from Roadmap

1. `/strategy` creates strategy.md (business positioning — optional but recommended)
2. `/vision` or `/clone-app` creates vision.md (reads strategy)
3. `/personas` creates persona files (reads strategy + vision)
4. `/constitution` creates constitution.md (reads strategy + vision)
5. `/design-tokens` creates personality-driven tokens (from vision + personas)
6. `/roadmap` or `/clone-app` creates roadmap.md (reads strategy for prioritization)
5. `/build-next` picks next pending feature (deps met)
6. Build loop runs per feature:
   - Phase 1: Spec agent (creates spec)
   - Phase 2: Build agent (RED → GREEN + self-check drift)
   - Post-build: build + test verification
   - Phase 3: Refactor agent (clean up code, tests must pass)
   - Phase 4: Drift check agent (Layer 2, fresh context)
   - Phase 5: Compound agent (extract learnings + failure signals)
   - Script marks roadmap ✅ (only after ALL phases pass)
7. Repeat until done

---

## Drift Enforcement

Spec↔code drift is enforced at two layers:

### Layer 1: Self-Check (same agent, lightweight)

Built into the build agent (Phase 2) after GREEN:
- The build agent re-reads its own Gherkin scenarios
- Compares against what it actually implemented
- Fixes obvious mismatches before committing

This is cheap (same context) but has the "fox guarding henhouse" limitation.

### Layer 1b: Post-Refactor Self-Check

Built into `/tdd` and `/spec-first --full` after the refactor step:
- Re-verify spec↔code alignment after refactoring
- Catch any subtle behavior changes from refactoring

### Layer 2: Fresh-Agent Cross-Check (separate agent, thorough)

Built into `build-loop-local.sh` and `overnight-autonomous.sh` (Phase 4):
- After refactor, a **separate agent** is spawned with fresh context
- Reads the spec file and source files without prior build context
- Reports `NO_DRIFT`, `DRIFT_FIXED`, or `DRIFT_UNRESOLVABLE`
- Feature is only marked complete if drift is clean

### Signal Protocol

The build agent MUST output these signals for drift checking:

```
FEATURE_BUILT: {feature name}
SPEC_FILE: {path to .feature.md file}
SOURCE_FILES: {comma-separated source file paths}
```

The drift-check agent MUST output one of:

```
NO_DRIFT
DRIFT_FIXED: {summary of what was reconciled}
DRIFT_UNRESOLVABLE: {what needs human attention}
```

### Configuration

In `.env.local`:

```bash
DRIFT_CHECK=true          # Enable/disable drift checking (default: true)
MAX_DRIFT_RETRIES=1       # Retry attempts for fixing drift (default: 1)
```
