> Specs-driven development workflow with design system integration


# Specs-Driven Development Workflow

This project uses a specs-driven workflow. The `.specs/` directory contains:
- `strategy.md` - Business strategy: target customer, buying motion, value prop
- `constitution.md` - Non-negotiable constraints: security, data handling, errors
- `migrations.md` - Database migration playbook: tool, conventions, reversibility (created by /infer-migrations)
- `features/` - Gherkin feature specifications with ASCII mockups
- `personas/` - User personas that inform every spec
- `test-suites/` - Documentation of what each test file covers
- `design-system/` - Design tokens and component patterns
- `learnings/` - Cross-cutting patterns by category
- `mapping.md` - Links features ↔ tests ↔ components ↔ design

## Command Triggers

When the user says any of these phrases, **automatically invoke `/spec-first`**:

| User says | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| "spec first" | Run `/spec-first {feature}` |
| "spec-first" | Run `/spec-first {feature}` |

| "go ahead" | Run `/tdd` with current spec |
| "build it" | Run `/tdd` with current spec |
| "implement it" | Run `/tdd` with current spec |
| "ship it" | Run `/tdd` with current spec |

Extract the feature description from the rest of their message.

When the user says any of these, **invoke the corresponding ralph/utility command**:

| User says | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| "ralph setup", "set up ralph", "configure ralph" | Run `/ralph-setup` |
| "ralph run", "run ralph", "start the loop", "run the loop" | Run `/ralph-run` |
| "clean slate", "kill everything", "restart everything", "nuke localhost" | Run `/clean-slate` |
| "generate guide", "update guide", "how to use guide" | Run `/guide` |

When the user says any of these, **invoke `/strategy`**:

| User says | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| "strategy" | Run `/strategy` |
| "product strategy" | Run `/strategy` |
| "business strategy" | Run `/strategy` |
| "shape this" | Run `/strategy` |
| "who are we selling to" | Run `/strategy` |
| "business model" | Run `/strategy` |

When the user says any of these, **invoke `/gtm`**:

| User says | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| "gtm playbook" | Run `/gtm` |
| "marketing plan" | Run `/gtm` |
| "how do we get users" | Run `/gtm` |
| "distribution plan" | Run `/gtm` |
| "growth plan" | Run `/gtm` |
| "channel strategy" | Run `/gtm` |
| "launch plan" | Run `/gtm` |

When the user says any of these, **invoke `/find-early-users`**:

| User says | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| "find early users" | Run `/find-early-users` |
| "find users" | Run `/find-early-users` |
| "find prospects" | Run `/find-early-users` |
| "find people" | Run `/find-early-users` |
| "who should I talk to" | Run `/find-early-users` |
| "find beta testers" | Run `/find-early-users` |

|-----|-----|
| "infer migrations" | Run `/infer-migrations` |
| "migration strategy" | Run `/infer-migrations` |
| "migration playbook" | Run `/infer-migrations` |
| "how do we do migrations" | Run `/infer-migrations` |
| "document our migrations" | Run `/infer-migrations` |
| "schema change strategy" | Run `/infer-migrations` |

**Create vs Update**: `/spec-first` auto-detects whether to create or update: searches `.specs/features/` for a matching spec (by path or frontmatter `feature:`). Match found → update existing spec. No match → create new spec. With `--full`, both paths continue through the full Red-Green-Refactor TDD cycle.

**Specs are state, not deltas**: a spec always describes the entire expected behavior of the feature as it exists now — "add three fields to the form" is a commit message, not a spec. Updates rewrite affected scenarios to the new truth (removing superseded ones) instead of appending change notes; the delta lives in git history.

### Full Mode Triggers

If user includes "full", "auto", "no stops", or "don't pause":
- Add `--full` flag to the command
- Example: "spec first user auth, full mode" → `/spec-first user auth --full`

## Project Setup (Once)

These are project-level infrastructure created once and referenced by every feature:

```
/strategy → creates .specs/strategy.md (business positioning, buying motion, metrics, GTM sketch)
 │
 ├──▶ /vision → creates .specs/vision.md (reads strategy)
 │     │
 │     ├──▶ /personas → creates .specs/personas/ (reads strategy + vision)
 │     │
 │     ├──▶ /constitution → creates .specs/constitution.md (reads strategy + vision)
 │     │
 │     └──▶ /design-tokens → creates tokens.md + DESIGN.md + preview.html
 │          (reads vision + personas to derive personality + values)
 │
 ├──▶ /roadmap → reads strategy for prioritization
 │
 └──▶ /gtm → creates .specs/gtm.md (reads strategy → channels, templates, timeline)
       │
       └──▶ /find-early-users → creates .specs/gtm/prospects.md (specific people + conversations)
```

All are optional but improve every spec that follows. `/spec-first` will note what's missing and still work without them.

### Ordering: GTM vs Vision

Both `/vision` and `/gtm` read strategy.md and can run independently. The **temporal order** depends on your situation:

**Finding product-market fit** (greenfield, unvalidated idea): GTM before vision. Use `/gtm` and `/find-early-users` to validate the problem with real people. Iterate on `/strategy` until it stabilizes. *Then* write `/vision` grounded in what you learned.

**Known product** (cloning an app, internal tool, experienced domain): Vision first. You already know what to build — go straight to `/vision`, then use `/gtm` for distribution.

```
PMF search:    /strategy → /gtm → /find-early-users → conversations → /strategy (update)
                   ↓ (once stable)
               /vision → /personas → /roadmap → build

Known product: /strategy → /vision → /personas → /roadmap → build
                   └──────→ /gtm → /find-early-users (in parallel)
```

### What happens in the SPEC step:

1. **Load context** — Read strategy, constitution, personas, design tokens, learnings index
2. **Write Gherkin** — Scenarios using persona vocabulary, matching patience level
3. **Write technical design** — Data model, API contracts, state management, key dependencies, program design (files, signatures, call stack), implementation slices (bridges WHAT→HOW)
4. **Write mockup** — ASCII art referencing design tokens
5. **Add strategy alignment** — How this feature supports the business strategy (if strategy.md exists)
6. **Add constitutional compliance** — Which constraints apply and how (if constitution.md exists)
7. **Add user journey** — Where this feature fits in the user's flow
8. **Persona revision** — Re-read through persona's eyes, revise, note changes
9. **Create component stubs** — For any new UI components
10. **Pause** — Show spec + revision notes, ask "Run `/tdd` when ready"

### What happens in the /tdd step (Red-Green-Refactor):

1. **RED** — Write failing tests from Gherkin scenarios + Technical Design
2. **GREEN** — Implement vertical slice by vertical slice until all tests pass, verifying and committing each slice (track failure signals: test retries, build failures)
3. **Drift Check L1** — Self-check spec vs code alignment, including Program Design vs actual structure (track drift as failure signal)
4. **REFACTOR** — Clean up code, tests must still pass
5. **Drift Check L1b** — Re-verify after refactoring (track drift as failure signal)
6. **COMPOUND** — Always runs. Extracts learnings AND failure signals (drift, retries, spec gaps, corrections)

---

## Design System

The design system is created once by `/design-tokens` and informed by vision + personas.

### How `/design-tokens` Works

It doesn't stamp a generic template. It:
1. Reads `.specs/vision.md`, `.specs/personas/`, and `.specs/strategy.md` for context
2. Reads a matching archetype from `.specs/design-system/references/{personality}.design.md`
3. Optionally uses [getdesign.md](https://getdesign.md/) inspiration (`npx getdesign@latest add {brand}`)
4. Writes **DESIGN.md** (Google spec), **tokens.md** (spec shorthand), and **preview.html** (visual review)
5. Creates `.cursor/rules/design-tokens.mdc`

Agents read **DESIGN.md** for UI; specs use **tokens.md** in ASCII mockups.

### When `/spec-first` Runs on Greenfield

If no design system exists:
1. Auto-create via `/design-tokens` flow (reads whatever context exists)
2. Create `.cursor/rules/design-tokens.mdc` cursor rule
3. Proceed with feature spec

### When a Spec References New Components

If ASCII mockup references a component that doesn't exist in `.specs/design-system/components/`:
1. Auto-create a **stub** file: `.specs/design-system/components/{component}.md`
2. Stub includes: name, purpose, "pending implementation" status
3. After implementation, stub gets filled in (manually or via `/document-component`)

---

## Personas

User personas live in `.specs/personas/` and inform every feature spec.

### What They Contain
- **Context**: How the user spends their day, devices, technical level
- **Vocabulary**: Their words vs developer words (drives UI labels)
- **Patience level**: Very Low / Low / Medium / High (drives flow length)
- **Frustrations**: Interaction patterns to avoid
- **Success metric**: How they measure if the app works

### How `/spec-first` Uses Them

**Before writing**: Loads persona vocabulary, patience level, and frustrations. This shapes the Gherkin scenarios, mockup labels, and flow complexity from the start.

**After writing**: Re-reads the spec through each persona's eyes. Revises vocabulary, simplifies flows, cuts anti-persona features. Reports what changed at the pause point.

### Creating Personas

Run `/personas` or they're auto-suggested on first `/spec-first` run. Most projects need 2:
- **Primary**: The main user. Every feature must work for them.
- **Anti-persona**: Who you're NOT building for. Prevents scope creep.

---

## Feature Spec Format (with ASCII Mockup)

Every feature spec in `.specs/features/` should include **YAML frontmatter** that powers the auto-generated mapping:

```markdown
---
feature: Feature Name
domain: domain-name
source: path/to/file.tsx
tests: []
components: []
design_refs: []
personas: [primary, anti-persona]
status: stub    # stub → specced → tested → implemented
created: YYYY-MM-DD
updated: YYYY-MM-DD
---

# Feature Name

**Source File**: `path/to/file.tsx`
**Design System**: `.specs/design-system/tokens.md`
**Personas**: `.specs/personas/primary.md`

## Feature: [Name]

[Brief description — who it's for and what problem it solves]

### Scenario: [Happy path]
Given [precondition]
When [action]
Then [expected result]

### Scenario: [Edge case]
Given [precondition]
When [action]
Then [expected result]

## User Journey

1. [Where user comes from]
2. **[This feature]**
3. [Where user goes next]

## Technical Design

### Data Model
- [Entity]: { [key fields] }
- Relationships: [how entities connect]

### API Contracts
<!-- Skip if purely client-side -->
- `[METHOD] [endpoint]` — [purpose]. Body/Query: { [shape] }. Returns: [shape]. Errors: [codes]

### State Management
- [What state lives where: URL params, local state, global store, server cache]
- [Key state transitions]

### Key Dependencies
- Uses: [existing modules, services, components]
- Introduces: [new modules this feature creates]

### Program Design
<!-- The shape of the code: file-tree diff, call stack, key signatures. Kept in sync with reality by drift checks — it is the documentation of how the code is laid out. -->
- Files: [created / modified, one line each]
- Call stack: [who calls what, indented tree]
- Key signatures: [the 3-5 functions/types that matter]

### Implementation Slices
<!-- M/L features only. 2-4 vertical slices, each ending in a verifiable state (curl, click, or test). GREEN implements one at a time. -->
1. [Slice] — verify: [how]

## Pause Triggers

If the user says any of these (or similar), create the spec and **STOP** - wait for approval:
- "let me review first"
- "write the spec first"
- "show me the Gherkin"
- "spec this out"
- "don't implement yet"
- "plan this first"
- "what would this look like?"
- "before you implement..."
- "hold on"
- "wait"
- "let me see"

**After showing the spec:** "Does this look right? Run `/tdd` when ready, or say 'go ahead' to start the Red-Green-Refactor cycle."

---

## Test ID Conventions

When documenting tests, use prefixes for component/module names:

| Prefix | Component/Module |
|--------|------------------|
| UT | utils |
| API | api handlers |
| SVC | services |
| CMP | components |
| PG | pages |
| HK | hooks |

New components/modules should get a 2-3 letter prefix.

## Auto-Generated Mapping

The `.specs/mapping.md` file is **auto-generated** from feature spec YAML frontmatter.

**Do NOT edit mapping.md directly.** Instead:
1. Update the feature spec's YAML frontmatter
2. Cursor hook auto-regenerates mapping.md on save
3. Or run `./scripts/generate-mapping.sh` manually

This prevents merge conflicts when multiple PRs touch different features.

## Always Mention

When working with specs, always tell the user:
- Which spec files you're reading
- Which spec files you're creating/updating
- Whether strategy.md and constitution.md were loaded
- Which persona files you're reading
- Which design system files you're creating/referencing
- Any gaps between specs and tests
- Any constitutional compliance conflicts
- Component stubs that need to be filled in

This helps the user track documentation changes.
