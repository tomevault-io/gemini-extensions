> An 80-column, full-screen **Markdown** editor for the Enhanced Apple //e

# a2-editor

An 80-column, full-screen **Markdown** editor for the Enhanced Apple //e
(128K, ProDOS 8), **written in** 6502 assembly in Merlin syntax. Files are
drafted on the //e and moved back to a Mac for publishing.

Note the distinction: this is a text editor *implemented in* assembly, not an
editor *for* assembly source. It is aimed at prose. Hard wrap on entry, no soft
wrap, and Markdown-aware emphasis shortcuts.

See `docs/design.md` for the memory map, buffer design, and keymap.

A splash screen shows at startup and waits for a key, and the editor then opens
on an EMPTY document — the sample lives on the disk as `SAMPLE.MD`, which is
where the suite gets its text. Anything driving the editor has to get past the
splash first — `reboot` in the suite
does that.

## Toolchain

Source lives here on the Mac and is cross-assembled; the //e never sees a
source file we didn't generate.

- **Merlin32** (`tools/merlin32`) — primary assembler. Built from
  `apple2accumulator/merlin32`.
- **AppleCommander 13.2** (`tools/ac`) — builds ProDOS disk images. Native
  arm64 binary, so no JRE is required.
- **Virtual ][ 11.4** — emulator, driven through AppleScript by `tools/vii.sh`.
- **Merlin 8 v2.48 (DOS 3.3)** — `vendor/`, the user's original assembler. Kept
  as the dialect reference, not used in the build.

`tools/bootstrap.sh` reconstructs all of it on a fresh clone.

## Commands

```
make            assemble $(SRC) with Merlin32
make disk       build a bootable ProDOS 8 image at build/ZIPEDIT.po
make run        build, boot in Virtual ][, print the screen
make test       run the regression suite
make pull       eject, then extract Markdown from the image into notes/
make push       convert notes/*.md back onto the image as ProDOS TXT
make eject      flush the mounted image to disk
make clean
```

`SRC` defaults to `src/edit.S`, the editor itself. The spikes are still
buildable and worth keeping: `make SRC=src/charset.S run` re-runs the character
generator probe, `src/hello.S` is the minimal toolchain check.

## Conventions

- **Merlin dialect.** Merlin32 is Merlin 16+ flavoured and is not identical to
  the Merlin 8 on the //e. Stay in the common subset: plain 6502, and the
  directives `ORG EQU DFB DW DS ASC HEX LUP MAC EOM`. Treat Merlin 8 as ground
  truth if the two ever disagree.
- **Case and layout.** Lowercase mnemonics, labels in column 1, opcodes at
  column 14, operands at column 20, comments at column 40 — matching the
  Merlin house style in `src/hello.S`.
- **Local labels** are `:name`, scoped to the enclosing global label.
- **Never hand-edit the help screen hex.** `src/help.S` holds 42 rows of raw
  screen codes and they are generated: edit the layout in `tools/genhelp.py`
  and re-run it. It enforces the column stops, so a description that would
  overrun the border fails there instead of shipping mangled.
- **Line breaks come in three kinds.** `HARDCR` is a return the writer typed,
  `SOFTCR` a wrap that replaced a space, `SOFTWD` a wrap inside a long word.
  Only `HARDCR` reaches the file. Test for a line end with `cmp #TEXTLO / bcc`,
  never `cmp #$8d` — a missed one is a break that some subsystem cannot see.
- **Never hard-code a screen column.** The layout's columns -- the wrap
  margin, the status row's fields, the prompt's hint, the help box's edge --
  live in the record in `src/geom.S`, filled at startup from a table. An
  equate compiled into the code that reads it is an 80-column assumption, and
  there is a 40-column machine coming. Rows are different: 24 either way, so
  `CHEATROW`, `STATROW` and `TEXTROWS` stay equates. `SCRW` survives only as
  the size of the widest line we allocate.
- **High ASCII.** Anything destined for the screen or for a text file has bit 7
  set. `asc "..."` (double quotes) sets it; single quotes do not.

## Keymap

Arrows move by character and line. OA-up/OA-down page, OA-`<`/OA-`>` jump to
the start and end of the document. Ctrl-A/Ctrl-E line ends, Ctrl-B bold (`**`),
Ctrl-I italic (`*`), Ctrl-D delete forward. OA-R reflow, OA-S save, OA-O open,
OA-C/OA-X/OA-V copy, cut and paste a line. OA-F find, OA-G find again, OA-L go
to line, OA-W word count, OA-Delete deletes back to the start of the word. OA-N starts a new document and OA-Q quits, both asking first if the document
is modified. OA-S saves to the document's own file and only prompts when it has
no name yet; OA-A is save as, which always prompts and adopts the new name.
Anything that replaces the document -- OA-N, OA-Q, OA-O -- must go through
ASKUNSAVED first. OA-? (or OA-H) opens the keyboard help,
which is two pages -- a key turns to page two, another leaves. OA-/ toggles the
one-line cheat sheet, OA-Q quits. **OA-`'` types a backtick** -- no Apple II
keyboard has a grave-accent key, so this is the only way in; three of them
make a fence. The ][+ spells it `Esc '`, and draws it as an apostrophe because
that character generator has no glyph for it. `$89` is both Tab and Ctrl-I and dispatches on
position -- see `docs/design.md`.

## Testing

`tests/run.sh` boots the built image in Virtual ][ and asserts against both the
emulated screen and emulated RAM. Prefer RAM assertions — `vii.sh dump <addr>
<len> <bank>` reads the auxiliary bank, so tests can check the text buffer
directly rather than inferring it from the display.

Use `vii.sh await <substring>` rather than fixed delays; it fails loudly on
timeout instead of silently reading a stale screen.

## Selection

OA-Space latches selection mode, the arrows paint, Esc cancels. Because the gap
is at the cursor, a selection is always contiguous in aux — before the gap or
after it, never split.

**Do not try shift-arrow again.** `$C063` is widely documented as the //e's
shift-key input but does not track the shift key on real hardware, and Virtual
][ reads it as permanently held.

## MouseText

The help border and the Open Apple glyph come from MouseText, at screen codes
`$40-$5F` with the alternate character set on. `make probe` builds a standalone
disk that identifies the ROM and dumps the glyphs on real hardware; it confirmed
Virtual ][ matches an Enhanced //e exactly, so glyph questions can be settled in
the emulator. Useful codes: `$4C`/`$53`/`$5C` horizontal rules at three heights,
`$5F` vertical, `$4E` solid block, `$5B` diamond, `$40`/`$41` solid and open
apple. There are **no** corner or T-junction glyphs.

Virtual ][ reads these codes back as the ASCII characters sharing their value,
so tests assert `\` for `$5C`, `L` for `$4C`, `_` for `$5F` and `A` for `$41`.

**MouseText only exists on an Enhanced //e.** The original keeps a second copy
of inverse uppercase at `$40-$5F`, so those same codes draw as letters there.
`src/machine.S` asks the CPU at startup -- decimal-mode `$99 + $01` is `$00` on
a 65C02 and `$9A` on a 6502, and the enhancement came as a set -- and rewrites
the help rows to `$20`, an inverse space, when MouseText is absent. `$41` is
left alone: it lands on inverse `A`, which reads fine as the Apple key.

Virtual ][ has no unenhanced //e, so `make plaindisk` patches an override byte
into a second image (`tools/forceplain.py`) and the suite drives that. Only the
detection itself still needs real hardware.

## Gotchas discovered the hard way

- `reset` in AppleScript is a *warm* reset and will not reboot from disk. Use
  `restart` for a cold boot.
- `tools/mkdisk.sh` clones the verified ProDOS image rather than formatting a
  fresh volume, so the boot blocks are known-good. It strips the disk to just
  `PRODOS` plus our `ZIPEDIT.SYSTEM`, and ProDOS auto-launches the only `.SYSTEM`
  file present.
- Never use `close every machine` in AppleScript — it would kill a Merlin
  session the user has open. `vii.sh` only ever touches `last machine`.
- ProDOS 8 puts `/RAM` in auxiliary memory on a 128K machine, which collides
  with the text buffer. It has to be disconnected at startup. See `docs/design.md`.
- `releases.prodos8.com` serves a GitHub Pages `*.github.io` certificate, so
  HTTPS fails name validation. `bootstrap.sh` fetches over HTTP and verifies by
  SHA-256 instead.
- **Rebuilding a mounted image gets it clobbered.** Virtual ][ buffers writes
  to a mounted image and flushes them on eject, so `make disk` on an image the
  emulator still holds is undone the moment the next `boot` ejects it -- and
  the editor then runs a stale binary. If a refactor moved code without
  changing its size, the file and the image are the same length and nothing
  looks wrong until the `toolchain` section compares them. `mkdisk.sh` ejects
  the image first now.
- **Only one test run at a time.** There is one front machine, so a second run
  or a stray `boot` steers it out from under the first, and the failures land
  in sections nothing touched. `tests/run.sh` takes a lock.
- **Virtual ][ buffers writes to a mounted image until the disk is ejected.**
  A file saved inside the emulator will not appear in the `.po` on disk until
  then, so `make pull` ejects first.
- **The Apple II keyboard has no buffer.** A ProDOS disk operation takes
  seconds of emulated time, and anything typed while it runs is dropped
  entirely. Tests must wait for an observable change rather than sleeping a
  fixed interval -- this cost two false test failures. Where an operation still
  prints a message, `vii.sh await` it; where it deliberately says nothing (a
  successful save or load, a cut), wait for the status row to return or for the
  text itself to change, and `vii.sh settle` before asserting.
- ProDOS pathnames are length-prefixed and **low** ASCII, unlike everything
  else on this machine, which is high ASCII.
- **Virtual ][ cannot send an arrow key with Open-Apple held.** `type open
  Apple` takes characters only, and ASCII 10 does not reach the machine as a
  down arrow. OA-up/OA-down are therefore not verifiable from the suite; the
  page handlers are `KUP`/`KDOWN` repeated, which the arrow tests do cover, but
  the bindings themselves need checking by hand.
- **`X` cannot hold a loop counter across `INSCHR`, `GAPLEFT` or `GAPRIGHT`.**
  `GAPLEFT` and `GAPRIGHT` `TAX` the byte they read out of aux; `INSCHR` sets
  `MODFLAG` through `X`. Count in memory. (`PUTAUX` used to belong on this list
  and no longer does: it saved `A` across a soft-switch write, which `STA` never
  disturbs in the first place.)
- **The Makefile must depend on all of `src/*.S`, not just `$(SRC)`.** The rest
  are pulled in with `put`, and depending on `$(SRC)` alone meant edits to them
  silently did not rebuild — which produced a stale binary that looked like a
  runaway bug in new code.
- **Virtual ][ can leave a machine frozen**, after which every AppleScript
  command fails with "Cannot perform this command while the machine is frozen"
  and the screen reads back stale. `vii.sh boot` now thaws first; `vii.sh thaw`
  does it on demand. A whole round of measurements was invalid before I spotted
  this.
- **Pin `keyboard delay`, not the speed.** It is a machine property -- seconds
  Virtual ][ waits between AppleScript key presses -- and it defaults to `0.0`,
  which injects keys faster than the editor can read them. The surplus queues
  up, and that queue **survives `restart`**: reboot, send nothing at all, and
  the cursor still walks across the screen on its own. One backlog took 33
  seconds to drain, dribbling into later sections and failing tests that never
  touched the code under test. `vii.sh boot` pins it to 0.2, which makes a
  burst of 20 arrows land exactly on target with no shell sleeps at all, even
  at `maximum`. Override with `VII_KEYDELAY` / `VII_SPEED`.
- **`restart` resets both `speed` and `keyboard delay`** to the machine's saved
  defaults, so pin them *after* the restart. Setting either first looks like it
  worked and silently does nothing. At `maximum` a held key also auto-repeats,
  so one `type key` can land as two or three keystrokes -- the keyboard delay
  fixes that; dropping to `regular` does not.
- **A scattered failure set means the harness, not the code.** Four runs of one
  unchanged tree gave 1, 29, 10 and 31 failures across unrelated sections. The
  31-failure run looked exactly like an editor regression and was not: every
  one was a stale machine or a keystroke backlog. Drain to a known state and
  re-run before believing any of it.
- **Virtual ][ cannot deliver `$8A`.** Something between AppleScript and the
  emulator turns a line feed into a carriage return, so Ctrl-J arrives as
  `$8D` however it is sent -- `type control "J"` and `character id 10` alike.
  The suite never noticed because it drives the down arrow with `key "down
  arrow"`, one of the five real special keys, which works. So `$8A ->
  KDOWNSEL` is exercised by the arrow key and is untestable via Ctrl-J. On
  real hardware Ctrl-J does send `$8A` -- confirmed on a ][+ with
  `make keyprobe` -- so the binding is sound and only the harness is blind to
  it. Beware the trap this sets: a status row reading `L:6 C:1` looks the same
  whether the cursor moved down five lines or five newlines were inserted.
  Dump the buffer.
- Typing costs a fixed ~100 ms plus ~0.035 ms per buffer byte, so tests must
  never sleep a fixed interval for a multi-character string. Use `ktext`, which
  waits for the text to appear.
- **Do NOT benchmark the redraw with the arrow keys.** This entry used to say
  exactly that, and it is wrong: an arrow press moves the cursor a whole LINE as
  well as repainting, and the movement is nearly all of it. Timed that way a
  full `RENDER` looks like 138-214ms -- the 1.1 table in the changelog is built
  on those numbers -- and measured properly it is 2-3ms. Believing the wrong
  figure sent an entire round of optimisation at the redraw, which was never the
  cost; the reflow was, at ~72% of a mid-paragraph keystroke. Use a key that
  repaints and does nothing else: an UNBOUND one, which `DISPATCH` ignores while
  the main loop still draws. Timing a burst of typing is no good either, for the
  opposite reason -- most keystrokes take the one-row path and never reach
  `RENDER` at all, so it averages the redraw away. That is how "depth in the
  document makes no difference" got measured, written into the source comments
  and believed, while the machine was taking half a second an arrow key at line
  112.
- **Virtual ][ cannot reproduce a dropped keystroke.** The real keyboard has no
  buffer and loses anything typed while the editor is busy; the emulator queues
  injected keys and delivers every one however slow the editor gets. This also
  means it cannot exercise the code that PREVENTS a loss: `KBPOLL`, and anything
  that asks whether a key is waiting, sees an empty latch in the emulator almost
  every time. Force the condition in a scratch build to measure it, and confirm
  the behaviour on real hardware. So a
  chars-per-second figure from the emulator describes throughput with a queue
  behind it, never what the writer feels. "I have to type slowly or it drops
  whole words" is a report the harness is structurally unable to make.
- `ktext` waits for its whole string to appear on one row, so it can never
  match text long enough to wrap. Type it with `"$VII" text` and `settle`
  instead.
