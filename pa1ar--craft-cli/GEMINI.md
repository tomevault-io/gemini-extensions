```

- source of truth: Craft's OpenAPI spec at `~/dev/craft-docs/craft-do-api/craft-do-openapi.json`
- craft-cli (`~/dev/tools/craft-cli/`) - wraps raw API, handles caveats
- raycast extension (`~/dev/raycast/craft/`) - imports `@1ar/craft-cli/lib`, never calls API directly
- when Craft changes endpoints: update cli first, then raycast follows

## Module layout

- `src/lib/client.ts` - CraftClient (pure fetch, Node-compatible, used by Raycast). do NOT add bun:sqlite imports here
- `src/lib/local-db.ts` - read-only access to Craft's local SQLite FTS5 + PlainTextSearch JSON. CLI-only (bun:sqlite)
- `src/lib/journal.ts` - mutation journal at `~/.cache/craft-cli/journal.db`. CLI-only (bun:sqlite)
- `src/cli/local.ts` - singleton for local store lifecycle
- `src/cli/journal-singleton.ts` - singleton for journal lifecycle
- `src/cli/commands/` - one file per command group (docs, blocks, tasks, patch, cat, diff, undo, log, etc.)
- `src/lib/index.ts` - public exports for library consumers. must NOT export local-db or journal (bun-only)

## Non-obvious

- compiled bun binary, not ts-node. `bun run build` after changes, binary at `dist/craft`
- hybrid read architecture: `docs ls` and `docs search` read from Craft's local SQLite when available, fall back to API. all writes go through API only
- read source precedence (highest first): per-command `--source auto|api|local` → per-command `--api` shortcut → `CRAFT_SOURCE` env → legacy `CRAFT_MODE` env (`api`|`hybrid`) → `config.source` → legacy `config.mode` → `auto` default. `auto` reads local Craft Desktop DB when available and falls back to API; `api` skips local; `local` fails if local is unavailable. source is resolved once in `src/cli/main.ts` and applied via `setSourceOverride()`. `craft source [auto|api|local]` persists; `craft mode [api|hybrid]` remains a legacy alias
- local stores update within ~1s of API writes (Craft app must be running)
- dual ID space: API entity IDs != PlainTextSearch internal documentIds. resolve via SQLite: `SELECT documentId FROM BlockSearch WHERE id = ? AND entityType = 'document'`
- local SQLite has plain text only (no markdown). PlainTextSearch JSON has full markdown in `markdownContent`
- `listDocs()` filters out pseudo-docs (block_taskInbox, block_taskLogbook) via UUID regex
- journal auto-prunes entries older than 7 days (~1/20 chance per record call)
- undo selector skips undo entries and already-undone mutations to find the right target
- API caveats tracked at `~/dev/craft-docs/craft-do-api/trials/CAVEATS.md` - read before assuming API behavior
- backlinks: not a real API feature. faked via title-based search + `block://` URI filtering. fragile by design
- `blocks insert` requires explicit target - the API silently routes orphan inserts to daily note, cli rejects that
- search defaults to `regexps` mode (RE2). `include` mode silently drops underscored tokens. local FTS5 uses unicode61 tokenizer
- exit codes: 0 ok, 1 user error, 2 api error, 3 auth, 4 not found
- tests: `bun test` (unit, 79 tests), `bun test tests/integration` (needs CRAFT_URL+CRAFT_KEY)
- env vars: `CRAFT_URL`, `CRAFT_KEY`, `CRAFT_PROFILE` (API config), `CRAFT_LOCAL_PATH` (override local DB discovery), `CRAFT_SPACE_ID` (for experiment scripts)

## Standing rules

- after any CLI surface change (new command, changed flags, new output format): update `skill/SKILL.md` in this repo. that file is the single source of truth and is the AI's primary discovery mechanism - stale skill = broken AI workflows. on dev machines `~/.claude/skills/craft-cli` is a symlink to `skill/` (created by `install.sh`), so editing the repo file propagates automatically
- after any CLI change: rebuild binary (`bun run build`), run tests (`bun test`), typecheck (`bun run typecheck`), verify skill still accurate
- after any install-affecting change (new dependency, build step, binary location, skill layout): re-run `./install.sh` on a clean checkout or read it top-to-bottom to verify it still works end-to-end
- journal calls in command handlers must be try-caught - never prevent the main operation from completing
- local-db and journal are CLI-only modules (bun:sqlite). never import them from src/lib/index.ts or src/lib/client.ts

## Research docs

- `docs/retrieval-comparison.md` - CLI vs API vs MCP vs local MD comparison with tables
- `docs/local-sqlite-schema.md` - Craft's local data store schema (SQLite FTS5, PlainTextSearch JSON, Realm)
- `docs/local-performance-results.md` - benchmarks: local reads 1,700x-6,600x faster than API
- `docs/cli-test-report-2026-04-08.md` - real-world CLI testing report with issues found and fixed

## Maintenance contract

This repo is set up to be vendor-ready (npm-publishable) but Bun-first. Keep it polished without protocol theatre.

### Commits and changelog
- One change per commit. Bug fix, feature, doc, chore - each one its own commit so `git bisect`, reverts, and changelog accumulation stay clean.
- Conventional-ish prefixes (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`, `test:`) - we already use these in history; keep going.
- Every commit that ships user-visible behavior or DX changes appends a one-liner to `CHANGELOG.md` under `## [Unreleased]`. Internal refactors, test-only changes, doc tweaks can skip the changelog.

### Releases
- SemVer. Patch for fixes, minor for additive features, major for breaking surface changes.
- Release procedure (one commit, one tag, one gh release):
  1. In `CHANGELOG.md`, rename `## [Unreleased]` to `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` and add a fresh empty `## [Unreleased]` above it. Update the link refs at the bottom.
  2. Bump `version` in `package.json`.
  3. Commit: `release: X.Y.Z`.
  4. `git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "X.Y.Z"`.
  5. `git push origin main --follow-tags`.
  6. `gh release create vX.Y.Z --notes "$(awk '/^## \[X.Y.Z\]/,/^## \[/{if(!/^## \[/ || /^## \[X.Y.Z\]/)print}' CHANGELOG.md)"` (or paste the relevant changelog section by hand).
- After every release: ship a matching `/updates/craft-cli-X.Y.Z.md` entry on `~/dev/1ar/1ar-astro` (kind: `update`) linking to `/projects/craft-cli` and the GitHub release. The update post is the public-facing changelog item.

### Issues and PRs
- Read incoming issues weekly. Triage labels we use (create as needed): `bug`, `enhancement`, `docs`, `wontfix`, `good-first-issue`.
- For PRs from contributors: check the diff actually does what the PR says, run `bun test` + `bun run typecheck` locally, request a `CHANGELOG.md` Unreleased entry if missing, then merge with squash so the merge commit becomes the single-change unit.
- Don't gate on style; gate on correctness and on whether `skill/SKILL.md` still reflects the CLI after the change.

### Sync with 1ar.io
- The "For AI agents" code block in `README.md` is mirrored in `~/dev/1ar/1ar-astro/src/pages/projects/craft-cli.astro`. The two must stay byte-identical. Any edit to the README block requires a matching edit on the website (and vice versa) - flag in the commit message.
- `1ar-astro/CLAUDE.md` carries the same rule from the website side.

### Distribution stance
- Personal tool, published as-is. We are not vendoring to npm yet, but the repo is kept in shape that we could (`name`, `version`, `bin`, `exports`, `license` would be the missing pieces - LICENSE file is currently absent, flag if/when we publish).
- Bun is the canonical toolchain. We do not target npm scripts or `node_modules/.bin` shims.

### Affiliation
- This is unofficial. Not affiliated with Craft Docs. The README states this near the top - keep it.
