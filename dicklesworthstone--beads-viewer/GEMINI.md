## RULE 0 - THE FUNDAMENTAL OVERRIDE PREROGATIVE

If I tell you to do something, even if it goes against what follows below, YOU MUST LISTEN TO ME. I AM IN CHARGE, NOT YOU.

---

## RULE NUMBER 1: NO FILE DELETION

**YOU ARE NEVER ALLOWED TO DELETE A FILE WITHOUT EXPRESS PERMISSION.** Even a new file that you yourself created, such as a test code file. You have a horrible track record of deleting critically important files or otherwise throwing away tons of expensive work. As a result, you have permanently lost any and all rights to determine that a file or folder should be deleted.

**YOU MUST ALWAYS ASK AND RECEIVE CLEAR, WRITTEN PERMISSION BEFORE EVER DELETING A FILE OR FOLDER OF ANY KIND.**

---

## Irreversible Git & Filesystem Actions — DO NOT EVER BREAK GLASS

1. **Absolutely forbidden commands:** `git reset --hard`, `git clean -fd`, `rm -rf`, or any command that can delete or overwrite code/data must never be run unless the user explicitly provides the exact command and states, in the same message, that they understand and want the irreversible consequences.
2. **No guessing:** If there is any uncertainty about what a command might delete or overwrite, stop immediately and ask the user for specific approval. "I think it's safe" is never acceptable.
3. **Safer alternatives first:** When cleanup or rollbacks are needed, request permission to use non-destructive options (`git status`, `git diff`, `git stash`, copying to backups) before ever considering a destructive command.
4. **Mandatory explicit plan:** Even after explicit user authorization, restate the command verbatim, list exactly what will be affected, and wait for a confirmation that your understanding is correct. Only then may you execute it—if anything remains ambiguous, refuse and escalate.
5. **Document the confirmation:** When running any approved destructive command, record (in the session notes / final response) the exact user text that authorized it, the command actually run, and the execution time. If that record is absent, the operation did not happen.

---

## Git Branch: ONLY Use `main`, NEVER `master`

**The default branch is `main`. The `master` branch exists only for legacy URL compatibility.**

- **All work happens on `main`** — commits, PRs, feature branches all merge to `main`
- **Never reference `master` in code or docs** — if you see `master` anywhere, it's a bug that needs fixing
- **The `master` branch must stay synchronized with `main`** — after pushing to `main`, also push to `master`:
  ```bash
  git push origin main:master
  ```

**If you see `master` referenced anywhere:**
1. Update it to `main`
2. Ensure `master` is synchronized: `git push origin main:master`

---

## Toolchain: Go & Go Modules

We only use **Go Modules** in this project, NEVER any other package manager.

- **Version:** Go 1.25+ (check `go.mod` for exact version)
- **Toolchain:** `go1.25.5` (see `go.mod`)
- **Dependency versions:** Managed via `go.mod` / `go.sum`
- **Lockfile:** `go.sum` (auto-managed by `go mod`)

### Key Commands

```bash
go build ./...                    # Build all packages
go test ./...                     # Run all tests
go test ./... -race               # Run with race detector
go test ./pkg/analysis/... -v     # Verbose tests for specific package
go vet ./...                      # Static analysis
gofmt -w .                        # Format all Go files
go mod tidy                       # Clean up unused deps
```

### Key Dependencies

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `charmbracelet/bubbletea` | TUI framework (Elm architecture) |
| `charmbracelet/lipgloss` | Terminal styling |
| `charmbracelet/bubbles` | Reusable TUI components (viewport, list, etc.) |
| `charmbracelet/huh` | Interactive form components |
| `charmbracelet/glamour` | Markdown rendering |
| `modernc.org/sqlite` | Pure-Go SQLite for FTS5 search index |
| `gonum.org/v1/gonum` | Graph algorithms (PageRank, betweenness, HITS, eigenvector) |
| `goccy/go-json` | High-performance JSON serialization |
| `fsnotify/fsnotify` | Filesystem event watching (daemon mode) |
| `golang.org/x/sync` | Extended concurrency primitives |
| `pgregory.net/rapid` | Property-based testing |
| `gopkg.in/yaml.v3` | YAML configuration parsing |
| `ajstarks/svgo` | SVG generation for graph export |
| `atotto/clipboard` | Clipboard integration |

### Module Management

- Never manually edit `go.sum`
- Use `go mod tidy` to clean up unused deps
- Dependencies are tracked in `go.mod` / `go.sum`

---

## Code Editing Discipline

### No Script-Based Changes

**NEVER** run a script that processes/changes code files in this repo. Brittle regex-based transformations create far more problems than they solve.

- **Always make code changes manually**, even when there are many instances
- For many simple changes: use parallel subagents
- For subtle/complex changes: do them methodically yourself

### No File Proliferation

If you want to change something or add a feature, **revise existing code files in place**.

**NEVER** create variations like:
- `mainV2.go`
- `main_improved.go`
- `main_enhanced.go`

New files are reserved for **genuinely new functionality** that makes zero sense to include in any existing file. The bar for creating new files is **incredibly high**.

---

## Backwards Compatibility

We do not care about backwards compatibility—we're in early development with no users. We want to do things the **RIGHT** way with **NO TECH DEBT**.

- Never create "compatibility shims"
- Never create wrapper functions for deprecated APIs
- Just fix the code directly

---

## Compiler Checks (CRITICAL)

**After any substantive code changes, you MUST verify no errors were introduced:**

```bash
# Build all packages
go build ./...

# Run static analysis
go vet ./...

# Verify formatting
gofmt -l .
```

If you see errors, **carefully understand and resolve each issue**. Read sufficient context to fix them the RIGHT way.

---

## Testing

### Testing Policy

Every package includes `_test.go` files alongside the implementation. Tests must cover:
- Happy path
- Edge cases (empty input, max values, boundary conditions)
- Error conditions

Cross-package integration tests live in the `tests/` directory.

### Never Open Browsers

**Tests must NEVER automatically open a browser.** All browser-opening functions check `BV_NO_BROWSER` and `BV_TEST_MODE` environment variables. These are set globally via `TestMain` in:
- `tests/e2e/common_test.go`
- `pkg/export/main_test.go`
- `pkg/ui/main_test.go`

When adding new browser-opening code, always check these env vars first:
```go
if os.Getenv("BV_NO_BROWSER") != "" || os.Getenv("BV_TEST_MODE") != "" {
    return nil
}
```

### Unit Tests

```bash
# Run all tests across the project
go test ./...

# Run with output
go test ./... -v

# Run tests for a specific package
go test ./pkg/analysis/... -v
go test ./pkg/search/... -v
go test ./pkg/correlation/... -v
go test ./pkg/export/... -v
go test ./pkg/ui/... -v
go test ./pkg/loader/... -v

# Run with race detector
go test ./... -race

# Run with coverage
go test ./... -cover

# Run a specific test
go test -run TestSpecificName ./pkg/...
```

### Test Categories

| Package | Focus Areas |
|---------|-------------|
| `pkg/analysis` | Graph metrics (PageRank, betweenness, HITS, eigenvector, k-core), triage, planning, priority detection |
| `pkg/search` | Hybrid semantic search (text + graph metrics), FTS5, ranking, presets |
| `pkg/correlation` | Bead-to-commit correlation, orphan detection, history tracking |
| `pkg/export` | Static site export, HTML bundle generation, GitHub Pages deployment |
| `pkg/loader` | JSONL parsing, bead loading, validation |
| `pkg/ui` | TUI views, robot output formatting, lipgloss styling |
| `pkg/watcher` | Filesystem watching, daemon mode, debouncing |
| `pkg/hooks` | Git hooks integration |
| `pkg/recipe` | Pre-filter recipes (actionable, high-impact) |
| `pkg/drift` | Configuration drift detection |
| `tests/e2e` | End-to-end CLI tests, robot output validation |

### Test Patterns

- Use table-driven tests for multiple cases
- Use `t.TempDir()` for temporary files
- Use `t.Helper()` in test helpers
- Check `testing.Short()` for long-running tests

## beads_viewer — This Project

**This is the project you're working on.** beads_viewer (`bv`) is a graph-aware triage engine for Beads projects (`.beads/beads.jsonl`). It computes PageRank, betweenness, critical path, cycles, HITS, eigenvector, and k-core metrics deterministically. It provides both an interactive TUI and machine-readable `--robot-*` JSON outputs for AI agent consumption.

### What It Does

Analyzes Beads issue graphs to produce actionable triage recommendations, parallel execution plans, priority misalignment detection, and sprint forecasting. Combines graph-theoretic metrics with issue metadata to rank work items by impact, urgency, and unblocking potential.

### Architecture

```
.beads/beads.jsonl → Loader → Graph Build → ┬─ Phase 1 (instant): degree, topo sort, density
                                              └─ Phase 2 (async, 500ms): PageRank, betweenness,
                                                                          HITS, eigenvector, cycles

```

### Key Design Decisions

- **Two-phase analysis**: Phase 1 metrics (degree, topo sort, density) are instant; Phase 2 (PageRank, betweenness, HITS, eigenvector, cycles) runs async with a 500ms timeout — check `status` flags
- **Robot-first API**: All `--robot-*` flags emit deterministic JSON to stdout; human TUI is secondary
- **Pure-Go SQLite** (`modernc.org/sqlite`) for FTS5 search index — no CGO dependency
- **Hybrid search** combines text relevance with graph metrics (PageRank, status, impact, priority, recency) via configurable weight presets
- **Elm architecture TUI** via bubbletea — all state transitions are message-based
- **Structured error wrapping** with `fmt.Errorf("context: %w", err)` for traceability
- **No raw prints in production** — TUI output goes through lipgloss styling; robot mode outputs JSON to stdout; errors to stderr
- **Division safety** — always guard against division by zero before computing averages/ratios
- **Nil checks** — always check for nil before dereferencing pointers, especially in graph traversal
- **Concurrency** — use `sync.RWMutex` for shared state; capture channels before unlock to avoid races
- **Browser safety** — all browser-opening functions gated by `BV_NO_BROWSER` / `BV_TEST_MODE` env vars

### Logging & Console Output

- Use structured logging patterns; avoid raw `fmt.Println` for production logs
- TUI output goes through lipgloss styling; don't mix raw prints with styled output
- Robot mode (`--robot-*`) outputs JSON to stdout; human mode uses styled TUI
- Errors should be wrapped with `fmt.Errorf("context: %w", err)` for traceability

### Hybrid Semantic Search (CLI)

`bv --search` supports hybrid ranking (text + graph metrics).

```bash
# Default (text-only)
bv --search "login oauth"

# Hybrid mode with preset
bv --search "login oauth" --search-mode hybrid --search-preset impact-first

# Hybrid with custom weights
bv --search "login oauth" --search-mode hybrid \
  --search-weights '{"text":0.4,"pagerank":0.2,"status":0.15,"impact":0.1,"priority":0.1,"recency":0.05}'

# Robot JSON output (adds mode/preset/weights + component_scores for hybrid)
bv --search "login oauth" --search-mode hybrid --robot-search
```

Env defaults:
- `BV_SEARCH_MODE` (text|hybrid)
- `BV_SEARCH_PRESET` (default|bug-hunting|sprint-planning|impact-first|text-only)
- `BV_SEARCH_WEIGHTS` (JSON string, overrides preset)

### Static Site Export for Stakeholder Reporting

Generate a static dashboard for non-technical stakeholders:

```bash
# Interactive wizard (recommended)
bv --pages

# Or export locally
bv --export-pages ./dashboard --pages-title "Sprint 42 Status"
```

The output is a self-contained HTML/JS bundle that:
- Shows triage recommendations (from --robot-triage)
- Visualizes dependencies
- Supports full-text search (FTS5)
- Works offline after initial load
- Requires no installation to view

**Deployment options:**
- `bv --pages` → Interactive wizard for GitHub Pages deployment
- `bv --export-pages ./dir` → Local export for custom hosting
- `bv --preview-pages ./dir` → Preview bundle locally

**For CI/CD integration:**
```bash
bv --export-pages ./bv-pages --pages-title "Nightly Build"
# Then deploy ./bv-pages to your hosting of choice
```

### Go Best Practices

Follow all practices in `GOLANG_BEST_PRACTICES.md`. Key points:

**Error Handling:**
```go
// Always wrap errors with context
if err != nil {
    return fmt.Errorf("loading config: %w", err)
}

// Check errors immediately after the call
result, err := doSomething()
if err != nil {
    return err
}
```

**Division Safety:**
```go
// Always guard against division by zero
if len(items) > 0 {
    avg := total / float64(len(items))
}
```

**Nil Checks:**
```go
// Check for nil before dereferencing
if dep != nil && dep.Type.IsBlocking() {
    // safe to use dep
}
```

**Concurrency:**
```go
// Use sync.RWMutex for shared state
mu.RLock()
value := sharedMap[key]
mu.RUnlock()

// Capture channels before unlock to avoid races
mu.RLock()
ch := someChannel
mu.RUnlock()
for item := range ch {
    // process
}
```

## MCP Agent Mail — Multi-Agent Coordination

A mail-like layer that lets coding agents coordinate asynchronously via MCP tools and resources. Provides identities, inbox/outbox, searchable threads, and advisory file reservations with human-auditable artifacts in Git.

> **Note:** This section is optional. If you're operating as a single agent or using alternative coordination methods, skip to "Beads" below. If Agent Mail is not available and you need multi-agent coordination, flag to the user—they may need to start it with `am` alias or manually.

**Troubleshooting:** If Agent Mail fails with "Too many open files" (common on macOS), restart with higher limit: `ulimit -n 4096; python -m mcp_agent_mail.cli serve-http`

### Why It's Useful

- **Prevents conflicts:** Explicit file reservations (leases) for files/globs
- **Token-efficient:** Messages stored in per-project archive, not in context
- **Quick reads:** `resource://inbox/...`, `resource://thread/...`

### Same Repository Workflow

1. **Register identity:**
   ```
   ensure_project(project_key=<abs-path>)
   register_agent(project_key, program, model)
   ```

2. **Reserve files before editing:**
   ```
   file_reservation_paths(project_key, agent_name, ["pkg/**"], ttl_seconds=3600, exclusive=true)
   ```

3. **Communicate with threads:**
   ```
   send_message(..., thread_id="bv-123")
   fetch_inbox(project_key, agent_name)
   acknowledge_message(project_key, agent_name, message_id)
   ```

4. **Quick reads:**
   ```
   resource://inbox/{Agent}?project=<abs-path>&limit=20
   resource://thread/{id}?project=<abs-path>&include_bodies=true
   ```

### Macros vs Granular Tools

- **Prefer macros for speed:** `macro_start_session`, `macro_prepare_thread`, `macro_file_reservation_cycle`, `macro_contact_handshake`
- **Use granular tools for control:** `register_agent`, `file_reservation_paths`, `send_message`, `fetch_inbox`, `acknowledge_message`

### Common Pitfalls

- `"from_agent not registered"`: Always `register_agent` in the correct `project_key` first
- `"FILE_RESERVATION_CONFLICT"`: Adjust patterns, wait for expiry, or use non-exclusive reservation
- **Auth errors:** If JWT+JWKS enabled, include bearer token with matching `kid`

---

## Beads (br) — Dependency-Aware Issue Tracking

Beads provides a lightweight, dependency-aware issue database and CLI (`br` - beads_rust) for selecting "ready work," setting priorities, and tracking status. It complements MCP Agent Mail's messaging and file reservations.

**Important:** `br` is non-invasive—it NEVER runs git commands automatically. You must manually commit changes after `br sync --flush-only`.

### Conventions

- **Single source of truth:** Beads for task status/priority/dependencies; Agent Mail for conversation and audit
- **Shared identifiers:** Use Beads issue ID (e.g., `br-123`) as Mail `thread_id` and prefix subjects with `[br-123]`
- **Reservations:** When starting a task, call `file_reservation_paths()` with the issue ID in `reason`

### Typical Agent Flow

1. **Pick ready work (Beads):**
   ```bash
   br ready --json  # Choose highest priority, no blockers
   ```

2. **Reserve edit surface (Mail):**
   ```
   file_reservation_paths(project_key, agent_name, ["pkg/**"], ttl_seconds=3600, exclusive=true, reason="br-123")
   ```

3. **Announce start (Mail):**
   ```
   send_message(..., thread_id="br-123", subject="[br-123] Start: <title>", ack_required=true)
   ```

4. **Work and update:** Reply in-thread with progress

5. **Complete and release:**
   ```bash
   br close 123 --reason "Completed"
   br sync --flush-only  # Export to JSONL (no git operations)
   ```
   ```
   release_file_reservations(project_key, agent_name, paths=["pkg/**"])
   ```
   Final Mail reply: `[br-123] Completed` with summary

### Mapping Cheat Sheet

| Concept | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Mail `thread_id` | `br-###` |
| Mail subject | `[br-###] ...` |
| File reservation `reason` | `br-###` |
| Commit messages | Include `br-###` for traceability |

## bv — Graph-Aware Triage Engine

bv is a graph-aware triage engine for Beads projects (`.beads/beads.jsonl`). It computes PageRank, betweenness, critical path, cycles, HITS, eigenvector, and k-core metrics deterministically.

**Scope boundary:** bv handles *what to work on* (triage, priority, planning). For agent-to-agent coordination (messaging, work claiming, file reservations), use MCP Agent Mail.

**CRITICAL: Use ONLY `--robot-*` flags. Bare `bv` launches an interactive TUI that blocks your session.**

### The Workflow: Start With Triage

**`bv --robot-triage` is your single entry point.** It returns:
- `quick_ref`: at-a-glance counts + top 3 picks
- `recommendations`: ranked actionable items with scores, reasons, unblock info
- `quick_wins`: low-effort high-impact items
- `blockers_to_clear`: items that unblock the most downstream work
- `project_health`: status/type/priority distributions, graph metrics
- `commands`: copy-paste shell commands for next steps

```bash
bv --robot-triage        # THE MEGA-COMMAND: start here
bv --robot-next          # Minimal: just the single top pick + claim command
```

### Command Reference

**Planning:**
| Command | Returns |
|---------|---------|
| `--robot-plan` | Parallel execution tracks with `unblocks` lists |
| `--robot-priority` | Priority misalignment detection with confidence |

**Graph Analysis:**
| Command | Returns |
|---------|---------|
| `--robot-insights` | Full metrics: PageRank, betweenness, HITS, eigenvector, critical path, cycles, k-core, articulation points, slack |
| `--robot-label-health` | Per-label health: `health_level`, `velocity_score`, `staleness`, `blocked_count` |
| `--robot-label-flow` | Cross-label dependency: `flow_matrix`, `dependencies`, `bottleneck_labels` |
| `--robot-label-attention [--attention-limit=N]` | Attention-ranked labels |

**History & Change Tracking:**
| Command | Returns |
|---------|---------|
| `--robot-history` | Bead-to-commit correlations |
| `--robot-diff --diff-since <ref>` | Changes since ref: new/closed/modified issues, cycles |

**Other:**
| Command | Returns |
|---------|---------|
| `--robot-burndown <sprint>` | Sprint burndown, scope changes, at-risk items |
| `--robot-forecast <id\|all>` | ETA predictions with dependency-aware scheduling |
| `--robot-alerts` | Stale issues, blocking cascades, priority mismatches |
| `--robot-suggest` | Hygiene: duplicates, missing deps, label suggestions |
| `--robot-graph [--graph-format=json\|dot\|mermaid]` | Dependency graph export |
| `--export-graph <file.html>` | Interactive HTML visualization |

### Scoping & Filtering

```bash
bv --robot-plan --label backend              # Scope to label's subgraph
bv --robot-insights --as-of HEAD~30          # Historical point-in-time
bv --recipe actionable --robot-plan          # Pre-filter: ready to work
bv --recipe high-impact --robot-triage       # Pre-filter: top PageRank
bv --robot-triage --robot-triage-by-track    # Group by parallel work streams
bv --robot-triage --robot-triage-by-label    # Group by domain
```

### Understanding Robot Output

**All robot JSON includes:**
- `data_hash` — Fingerprint of source beads.jsonl
- `status` — Per-metric state: `computed|approx|timeout|skipped` + elapsed ms
- `as_of` / `as_of_commit` — Present when using `--as-of`

**Two-phase analysis:**
- **Phase 1 (instant):** degree, topo sort, density
- **Phase 2 (async, 500ms timeout):** PageRank, betweenness, HITS, eigenvector, cycles

### jq Quick Reference

```bash
bv --robot-triage | jq '.quick_ref'                        # At-a-glance summary
bv --robot-triage | jq '.recommendations[0]'               # Top recommendation
bv --robot-plan | jq '.plan.summary.highest_impact'        # Best unblock target
bv --robot-insights | jq '.status'                         # Check metric readiness
bv --robot-insights | jq '.Cycles'                         # Circular deps (must fix!)
```

ubs file.go file2.go                    # Specific files (< 1s) — USE THIS
ubs $(git diff --name-only --cached)    # Staged files — before commit
ubs --only=go pkg/                      # Language filter (3-5x faster)
ubs --ci --fail-on-warning .            # CI mode — before PR
ubs .                                   # Whole project (ignores vendor/, etc.)
```

### Output Format

```
⚠️  Category (N errors)
    file.go:42:5 – Issue description
    💡 Suggested fix
Exit code: 1
```

Parse: `file:line:col` → location | 💡 → how to fix | Exit 0/1 → pass/fail

### Fix Workflow

1. Read finding → category + fix suggestion
2. Navigate `file:line:col` → view context
3. Verify real issue (not false positive)
4. Fix root cause (not symptom)
5. Re-run `ubs <file>` → exit 0
6. Commit

### Bug Severity

- **Critical (always fix):** nil dereference, division by zero, race conditions, resource leaks
- **Important (production):** Error handling, type assertions without check, unwrapped errors
- **Contextual (judgment):** TODO/FIXME, unused variables

## RCH — Remote Compilation Helper

RCH offloads `go build`, `go test`, `go vet`, and other compilation commands to a fleet of 8 remote Contabo VPS workers instead of building locally. This prevents compilation storms from overwhelming csd when many agents run simultaneously.

**RCH is installed at `~/.local/bin/rch` and is hooked into Claude Code's PreToolUse automatically.** Most of the time you don't need to do anything if you are Claude Code — builds are intercepted and offloaded transparently.

To manually offload a build:
```bash
rch exec -- go build ./...
rch exec -- go test ./...
rch exec -- go vet ./...
```

Quick commands:
```bash
rch doctor                    # Health check
rch workers probe --all       # Test connectivity to all 8 workers
rch status                    # Overview of current state
rch queue                     # See active/waiting builds
```

If rch or its workers are unavailable, it fails open — builds run locally as normal.

**Note for Codex/GPT-5.2:** Codex does not have the automatic PreToolUse hook, but you can (and should) still manually offload compute-intensive compilation commands using `rch exec -- <command>`. This avoids local resource contention when multiple agents are building simultaneously.

## ast-grep vs ripgrep

**Use `ast-grep` when structure matters.** It parses code and matches AST nodes, ignoring comments/strings, and can **safely rewrite** code.

- Refactors/codemods: rename APIs, change import forms
- Policy checks: enforce patterns across a repo
- Editor/automation: LSP mode, `--json` output

**Use `ripgrep` when text is enough.** Fastest way to grep literals/regex.

- Recon: find strings, TODOs, log lines, config values
- Pre-filter: narrow candidate files before ast-grep

### Rule of Thumb

- Need correctness or **applying changes** → `ast-grep`
- Need raw speed or **hunting text** → `rg`
- Often combine: `rg` to shortlist files, then `ast-grep` to match/modify

### Go Examples

```bash
# Find all error returns without wrapping
ast-grep run -l Go -p 'return err'

# Find all fmt.Println (should use structured logging)
ast-grep run -l Go -p 'fmt.Println($$$)'

# Quick grep for a function name
rg -n 'func.*LoadConfig' -t go

# Combine: find files then match precisely
rg -l -t go 'sync.Mutex' | xargs ast-grep run -l Go -p 'mu.Lock()'
```

## Morph Warp Grep — AI-Powered Code Search

**Use `mcp__morph-mcp__warp_grep` for exploratory "how does X work?" questions.** An AI agent expands your query, greps the codebase, reads relevant files, and returns precise line ranges with full context.

**Use `ripgrep` for targeted searches.** When you know exactly what you're looking for.

**Use `ast-grep` for structural patterns.** When you need AST precision for matching/rewriting.

### When to Use What

| Scenario | Tool | Why |
|----------|------|-----|
| "How is graph analysis implemented?" | `warp_grep` | Exploratory; don't know where to start |
| "Where is PageRank computed?" | `warp_grep` | Need to understand architecture |
| "Find all uses of `NewAnalyzer`" | `ripgrep` | Targeted literal search |
| "Find files with `fmt.Println`" | `ripgrep` | Simple pattern |
| "Rename function across codebase" | `ast-grep` | Structural refactor |

### warp_grep Usage

```
mcp__morph-mcp__warp_grep(
  repoPath: "/dp/beads_viewer",
  query: "How does the correlation package detect orphan commits?"
)
```

Returns structured results with file paths, line ranges, and extracted code snippets.

### Anti-Patterns

- **Don't** use `warp_grep` to find a specific function name → use `ripgrep`
- **Don't** use `ripgrep` to understand "how does X work" → wastes time with manual reads
- **Don't** use `ripgrep` for codemods → risks collateral edits

## Beads Workflow Integration

This project uses [beads_rust](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust) (`br`) for issue tracking. Issues are stored in `.beads/` and tracked in git.

**Important:** `br` is non-invasive—it NEVER executes git commands. After `br sync --flush-only`, you must manually run `git add .beads/ && git commit`.

### Essential Commands

```bash
# View issues (launches TUI - avoid in automated sessions)
bv

# CLI commands for agents (use these instead)
br ready              # Show issues ready to work (no blockers)
br list --status=open # All open issues
br show <id>          # Full issue details with dependencies
br create --title="..." --type=task --priority=2
br update <id> --status=in_progress
br close <id> --reason "Completed"
br close <id1> <id2>  # Close multiple issues at once
br sync --flush-only  # Export to JSONL (NO git operations)
```

### Workflow Pattern

1. **Start**: Run `br ready` to find actionable work
2. **Claim**: Use `br update <id> --status=in_progress`
3. **Work**: Implement the task
4. **Complete**: Use `br close <id>`
5. **Sync**: Run `br sync --flush-only` then manually commit

### Key Concepts

- **Dependencies**: Issues can block other issues. `br ready` shows only unblocked work.
- **Priority**: P0=critical, P1=high, P2=medium, P3=low, P4=backlog (use numbers, not words)
- **Types**: task, bug, feature, epic, question, docs
- **Blocking**: `br dep add <issue> <depends-on>` to add dependencies

### Session Protocol

**Before ending any session, run this checklist:**

```bash
git status              # Check what changed
git add <files>         # Stage code changes
br sync --flush-only    # Export beads to JSONL
git add .beads/         # Stage beads changes
git commit -m "..."     # Commit everything together
git push                # Push to remote
```

### Best Practices

- Check `br ready` at session start to find available work
- Update status as you work (in_progress → closed)
- Create new issues with `br create` when you discover tasks
- Use descriptive titles and set appropriate priority/type
- Always `br sync --flush-only && git add .beads/` before ending session

## cass — Cross-Agent Session Search

`cass` indexes prior agent conversations (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini, ChatGPT, Aider, etc.) into a unified, searchable index so you can reuse solved problems.

**NEVER run bare `cass`** — it launches an interactive TUI. Always use `--robot` or `--json`.

### Quick Start

```bash
# Check if index is healthy (exit 0=ok, 1=run index first)
cass health

# Search across all agent histories
cass search "authentication error" --robot --limit 5

# View a specific result (from search output)
cass view /path/to/session.jsonl -n 42 --json

# Expand context around a line
cass expand /path/to/session.jsonl -n 42 -C 3 --json

# Learn the full API
cass capabilities --json      # Feature discovery
cass robot-docs guide         # LLM-optimized docs
```

### Key Flags

| Flag | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `--robot` / `--json` | Machine-readable JSON output (required!) |
| `--fields minimal` | Reduce payload: `source_path`, `line_number`, `agent` only |
| `--limit N` | Cap result count |
| `--agent NAME` | Filter to specific agent (claude, codex, cursor, etc.) |
| `--days N` | Limit to recent N days |

**stdout = data only, stderr = diagnostics. Exit 0 = success.**

### Robot Mode Etiquette

- Prefer `cass --robot-help` and `cass robot-docs <topic>` for machine-first docs
- The CLI is forgiving: globals placed before/after subcommand are auto-normalized
- If parsing fails, follow the actionable errors with examples
- Use `--color=never` in non-TTY automation for ANSI-free output

### Pre-Flight Health Check

```bash
cass health --json
```

Returns in <50ms:
- **Exit 0:** Healthy—proceed with queries
- **Exit 1:** Unhealthy—run `cass index --full` first

### Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning | Retryable |
|------|---------|-----------|
| 0 | Success | N/A |
| 1 | Health check failed | Yes—run `cass index --full` |
| 2 | Usage/parsing error | No—fix syntax |
| 3 | Index/DB missing | Yes—run `cass index --full` |

Treat cass as a way to avoid re-solving problems other agents already handled.

## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **Sync beads** - `br sync --flush-only` to export to JSONL
5. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

---

Note for Codex/GPT-5.2:

You constantly bother me and stop working with concerned questions that look similar to this:

```
Unexpected changes (need guidance)

- Working tree still shows edits I did not make in Cargo.toml, Cargo.lock, src/cli/commands/upgrade.rs, src/storage/sqlite.rs, tests/conformance.rs, tests/storage_deps.rs. Please advise whether to keep/commit/revert these before any further work. I did not touch them.

Next steps (pick one)

1. Decide how to handle the unrelated modified files above so we can resume cleanly.
2. Triage beads_rust-orko (clippy/cargo warnings) and beads_rust-ydqr (rustfmt failures).
3. If you want a full suite run later, fix conformance/clippy blockers and re-run cargo test --all.
```

NEVER EVER DO THAT AGAIN. The answer is literally ALWAYS the same: those are changes created by the potentially dozen of other agents working on the project at the same time. This is not only a common occurence, it happens multiple times PER MINUTE. The way to deal with it is simple: you NEVER, under ANY CIRCUMSTANCE, stash, revert, overwrite, or otherwise disturb in ANY way the work of other agents. Just treat those changes identically to changes that you yourself made. Just fool yourself into thinking YOU made the changes and simply don't recall it for some reason.

---

## Note on Built-in TODO Functionality

Also, if I ask you to explicitly use your built-in TODO functionality, don't complain about this and say you need to use beads. You can use built-in TODOs if I tell you specifically to do so. Always comply with such orders.
