## Lead Magnet Quiz Workflow

Multi-agent workflow that produces a Vercel-deployable quiz funnel.

### Stages

- **Stage 1A+1B**: Research Agent + Product Scraping Agent (parallel)
- **Stage 2A+2B**: Architecture Agent + Design Strategy Agent (parallel)
- **Stage 3**: Copy Agent (+ Strategy Pack: ads, social roadmap, sales scripts)
- **Stage 4**: Build Agent (outputs Vercel-ready Astro app with local images + social ad video)
- **Stage 5**: Publish Agent (GitHub + GitHub Pages + Notion)
- **Post-workflow**: Run `/setup-quiz-db [business-name]` to connect Supabase and deploy

### Trigger

```

```

```

### Data Flow

Quiz submission -> Vercel Edge Function -> Supabase -> Email scheduling -> Content block resolution (profile blocks + answer callbacks) -> Resend (hourly cron)

### Email Personalization

26 emails across 5 sequences (Welcome, Cold Nurture, Warm Activation, Hot Path, Re-Engagement) with layered personalization:

- **Temperature** controls which sequence track (hot/warm/cold)
- **Profile** controls `{{profile_block}}` content injected into 10 emails
- **Quiz answers** control `{{answer_callback_N}}` snippets in 7 emails (from diagnostic questions identified by Architecture Agent)
- Content blocks stored in `{PREFIX}content_blocks` table, seeded from `content-blocks.csv`

### Analytics

Page events -> `/api/analytics-event` -> `analytics_events` table -> `/api/analytics-query` -> Dashboard

- **Admin dashboard** at `[deployed-url]/admin` with password protection (ADMIN_PASSWORD env var)
- Tracks 8 event types: page_view, quiz_start, question_viewed, answer_selected, email_captured, quiz_completed, result_page_viewed, cta_clicked
- Uses Chart.js for funnel visualization, temperature distribution, daily activity, answer analysis, UTM sources
- **Data retention**: Daily cron (`/api/data-cleanup` at 3 AM) deletes analytics events older than 90 days and sent email logs older than 365 days. Configurable via `DATA_RETENTION_ANALYTICS_DAYS` and `DATA_RETENTION_EMAIL_DAYS` env vars. Leads and quiz responses are never auto-deleted.

### Results Page Archetypes

Architecture Agent selects one of 5 archetypes based on business type + audience:

| Archetype | Best For | Visualization | Celebration |
|-----------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `scorecard` | B2B, finance | Radar chart | Confetti |
| `style_profile` | Ecom, lifestyle | Spectrum bars | Shimmer |
| `pathway` | Education, coaching | Milestone map | Cascade |
| `archetype_reveal` | Personal brands | Trait badges | Shimmer |
| `diagnostic` | Agencies, tech | Horizontal bars | Confetti |

### Social Ad Video

Build Agent always creates a 20-second Remotion social ad (`deploy/videos/SocialAd.tsx`) and renders it to MP4 via `render-quiz-videos.sh`. The video MUST show ALL quiz profiles (not a subset).

### Deployment

```bash
cd deploy && npm install && npm run setup-db && npm run build && vercel --prod
```

- `npm run setup-db` creates all tables AND seeds email templates + content blocks from CSV (single command)
- Requires: Supabase project + env vars (SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY, TABLE_PREFIX, optional RESEND_API_KEY, ADMIN_PASSWORD)

### Client Preview

Published to GitHub Pages for client review of walkthrough, research, email sequences, copy explainer, and strategy pack.

- GitHub Pages URL: `https://[github-username].github.io/[business-name]-quiz-preview/`
- Private repo: `[github-username]/[business-name]-quiz-funnel`

### Troubleshooting

- If Playwright MCP fails, workflow automatically falls back to: BrowserBase -> WebFetch -> Manual overrides -> Archetype defaults
- Manual overrides available: `primary_color_override`, `heading_font_override`, `visual_style_override`
- Design Strategy Agent tracks detection method: `detected_from` field shows `playwright|browserbase|webfetch|override|inferred`
- See `agents/lead-magnet-agents/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` for complete diagnostics guide
- Project Manager Agent (Step 3b) validates website accessibility before Design Agent runs

## Lead Magnet Vision Board Workflow

Multi-agent workflow that produces a Vercel-deployable interactive vision board builder with AI-generated shareable graphics.

### Stages

- **Stage 1A+1B**: Research Agent (reused) + Service Scraping Agent (forked) (parallel)
- **Stage 2A+2B**: VB Architecture Agent (forked) + Design Strategy Agent (reused) (parallel)
- **Stage 3**: VB Copy Agent (forked) (+ Strategy Pack: ads, social roadmap, consultation scripts)
- **Stage 4**: VB Build Agent (forked) (outputs Vercel-ready builder app with Glif graphic generation)
- **Stage 5**: Publish Agent (reused) (GitHub + GitHub Pages + Notion)
- **Post-workflow**: Run `/setup-visionboard-db [business-name]` to connect Supabase + Glif and deploy

### Trigger

```
/lead-magnet-vision-board [url] --vertical wedding|real-estate|contractor|custom
```

### How It Differs from Quiz

| | Quiz Funnel | Vision Board Builder |
|---|---|---|
| User flow | Linear quiz with scoring | Multi-step builder/configurator |
| Output to user | Score + temperature + recommendations | Shareable graphic + profile + recommendations |
| Lead qualification | Explicit (score 0-100, hot/warm/cold) | Implicit (derived from budget + timeline tags) |
| Viral mechanic | None | Download + social share of branded graphic |
| Best verticals | B2B SaaS, consultants | Real estate, weddings, contractors |

### Key Features

- Preference dimensions replace quiz scoring (tag-based profile matching)
- 5 selection types: card_selection, chip_multi_select, scale_selector, toggle_group, image_grid
- Glif AI graphic generation (build-time via MCP + runtime via REST API)
- Download and social share buttons on reveal page
- 10 emails across 4 sequences (inspiration-first, not sales-first)
- Pre-built vertical templates for wedding, real estate, contractor

### Glif Integration

Uses Nano Banana Pro (ID: `cmi7ne4p40000kz04yup2nxgh`):
- **Build-time**: `run_glif` MCP tool for style cards, hero images, profile mood boards
- **Runtime**: REST API at `https://simple-api.glif.app` for personalized user graphics
- **Caching**: SHA-256 hash of selections stored in `graphic_cache` table

### Vertical Templates

Located in `.claude/skills/lead-magnet-vision-board/references/`:
- `vertical-wedding.json` - 6 dimensions, 4 profiles (Romantic, Classic, Adventurer, Entertainer)
- `vertical-real-estate.json` - 6 dimensions, 5 profiles (Minimalist, Nester, Entertainer, Urbanite, Retreater)
- `vertical-contractor.json` - 5 dimensions, 4 profiles (Modernizer, Craftsman, Host, Sanctuary Seeker)

## Configuration

### workflow-config.json

Central configuration file at the repo root:

```json
{
  "github_username": "YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME",
  "notion_database_id": "YOUR_NOTION_DATABASE_ID",
  "paths": {
    "output_directory": "./output",

}
```

### .claude/.mcp.json

Generated from `.claude/.mcp.json.template` during setup. Contains API tokens for Notion, Glif, Supabase, and Memory MCP servers. This file is gitignored -- never commit it.

### Setup

Run the interactive setup script after cloning:

```bash
./scripts/setup.sh
```

This will:
1. Set your GitHub username and Notion database ID in `workflow-config.json` and skill files
2. Configure MCP server API tokens (Notion, Glif, Supabase)
3. Optionally install Remotion dependencies
4. Verify prerequisites (GitHub CLI, Node.js)

## Conventions

- Output goes in `output/[business-name]/` during active builds
- Completed funnels live on GitHub only -- `output/` is a working directory, cleared after publishing
- Always use MCP tools for research when available (do not generate generic content)
- Validation gates between agent stages (do not proceed if output is incomplete)
- Skills are defined in `.claude/skills/[skill-name]/SKILL.md`
- Agent definitions are in `agents/[workflow-name]/[agent-name]/SKILL.md`
- Design modes: Soft, Sharp, Glass, Glossy, Minimal (auto-detected from brand website)
- Question types must include 3+ different types per quiz (card_selection, scale_slider, multiple_choice, yes_no_toggle, tag_cloud, emoji_scale, star_rating)
- Social ad videos must show ALL profiles, never a subset
- Temperature (hot/warm/cold) is internal only -- never shown to quiz takers
- Update this file when adding or removing skills, agents, or workflow stages
