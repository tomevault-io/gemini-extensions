# Agent Instructions

**Testing policy: CI runs the full e2e suite on every PR — rely on it for PR verification, and locally run the specs your change touches (plus `npm test` for unit tests).**

## Testing Requirements

Every new feature MUST be accompanied by:

- **Unit tests** covering the API/logic layer (if applicable)
- **E2E tests** (Playwright) covering:
  - The happy path (full user journey)
  - Edge cases (empty states, error handling, boundary conditions)

Tests live in:

- `src/**/*.test.ts` - vitest unit tests — run with `npm test`
- `api/src/**/*.test.ts` - bun:test unit tests — run with `cd api && bun test` (vitest excludes `api/**`; don't mix the two runners)
- `e2e/` - Playwright end-to-end tests — run with `npm run test:e2e` (boots both servers against an isolated `tmp/e2e-data`, never the real `data/`)

CI runs all of these, plus the e2e suite a second time against the production Docker image (`E2E_EXTERNAL_SERVER=1` with the container mapped to :3456 for the UI and :3457 for the Hono API the browser calls directly) to cover the standalone build and `docker-entrypoint.sh`. That e2e image is the amd64 image that a merge to master publishes. The workflow applies a new tag to it. It does not build it again.

A release tag is the one exception. `release.yml` builds the image again at the tag, because `git describe` must resolve to the tag for the About panel to report it. The release e2e job then runs against that rebuilt image, so the artifact that ships is the artifact that CI tested.

## API Documentation

`api/openapi.json` is generated from the route table, and it must stay complete.

- Mount a new route module in `api/src/routes/registry.ts`, never in `api/src/index.ts`.
- Add one entry per endpoint to `api/src/lib/openapi/annotations.ts`, keyed `"<METHOD> <path>"`.
- Run `npm run gen:openapi` and commit `api/openapi.json` with the change.

`bun test` in `api/` fails while a route has no entry, or while the committed
document is stale. The document holds only the endpoints a personal access token
can reach. The scope map in `api/src/lib/auth.ts` decides that set.

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 16 + React 19 — the front-end. It serves the UI only: no database, and **no `/api/*` routes** (the Next→Hono proxy was removed in #188).
- Hono on Bun is the API backend (`api/`), using Bun's native `bun:sqlite`. The browser talks to it **directly** — `src/lib/data-layer.ts` and the other client fetchers route every call through `apiFetch`/`apiUrl` from `src/lib/api-base.ts`, which reads the API origin from `window.__ENV__.API_URL`. That's injected at container start by `docker-entrypoint.sh` from the runtime `API_URL` env (written to `/__env.js`), since `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` bakes at build and can't be set on a prebuilt image; it falls back to `http://localhost:3457` for dev. The cross-origin calls rely on Hono's `app.use('*', cors())`. (better-sqlite3 survives only as a devDependency, for the `scripts/build-dictionary.ts` / `export-cached-entries.ts` tooling.)
- Tailwind CSS v4 (class-based dark mode via `@custom-variant`)
- shadcn/ui (Base UI primitives, `base-vega` style, zinc tokens) is initialized — add primitives with `npx shadcn@latest add <component>` into `src/components/ui/` and extend them there. Adoption is gradual: prefer `ui/` components in new/touched code, don't hand-roll buttons/dialogs/menus, and don't mass-migrate existing ones

## Flow maps

Maps of every app domain are in `docs/flows/`. Open `docs/flows/index.html` to walk the graph. The Lector node has a First walk. When you change a listed path, update `docs/flows/graph-data.js` and the matching `.md` notes. Then run `node docs/flows/validate-graph.mjs`.

## Key Patterns

- Pages use `NavHeader` component for sidebar/bottom nav
- Desktop sidebar is 56 units wide (`sm:ml-56` on page wrapper)
- Dark mode uses `.dark` class on `<html>`, toggled via `ThemeToggle`
- Practice page has type and MC modes with a fallback MC option

## SRS Behaviour (implemented in `src/app/practice/page.tsx`)

- Intervals: 0/1/3/7/14 days for mastery levels 0/25/50/75/100, scheduled at the exact review time (no midnight flooring). Mastery-100 cards keep a 14-day maintenance review and are served when due.
- Correct answers move up one level (+25). A miss hard-resets the card to mastery 0 and re-queues it at the end of the round; the retry runs from mastery 0 and awards no points (the answer was just shown).
- Cloze words from the bank can carry trailing punctuation — always strip via `splitTrailingPunctuation` (`src/lib/words.ts`) before matching, displaying, or persisting them.

## Dates, Streaks & Time Zone

- Day rollover (daily stats, streaks, review days) uses the `timezone` setting (Settings → Time Zone), falling back to the server's zone — never raw UTC. Server helper: `api/src/lib/dates.ts` (`getTodayDate()`); pure client-side math in `src/lib/dates.ts`.
- One streak definition app-wide: a day is active if it has any dictionary lookups, cloze practice, or reading minutes. Computed by `computeStreaks` (`src/lib/streak.ts`, mirrored in `api/src/lib/streak.ts`), served by `/api/stats/streak` (current + longest). Pages must not compute their own streaks.
- Pure helpers used on both sides (e.g. `dates`, `streak`, `stats-derive`) are mirrored between the client `src/lib/` copy and the Hono `api/src/lib/` copy — keep them in sync when editing. The Hono API owns the DB; the client copies are for rendering only.

# Repository instructions for coding agents

## Formatting

- `.editorconfig` and `.prettierrc` are the canonical shared formatting settings.
- Install dependencies from `package-lock.json`; the repository pins Prettier and its Tailwind plugin so every agent uses the same formatter implementation.
- Format only files changed for the current task: `npx prettier --write <touched-files...>`.
- Do not run repository-wide formatting during a feature or fix. The legacy tree is not yet fully normalized, so doing so creates unrelated review churn.
- Before handing off, run `npx prettier --check <touched-files...>` and `git diff --check`.
- A future formatting-only baseline change should normalize the whole tree before `npm run format:check` becomes a required CI gate.

## Code Comments

Write no comment by default. To test one, delete it. Then ask whether a competent reader can still get this code right. Keep the comment only when the answer is no. This test covers a doc comment as much as a `//` line.

- One comment states one fact, in two lines at most. A third line means the code needs a better name or a smaller function.
- A comment earns its place only when it records what the code cannot show:
  - a contract that a caller must honour
  - an invariant that ties two places together
  - a unit, or a magic value
  - a quirk in an external system, or in a data source
  - a mirrored file that must stay in step
- Do not editorialise. Cut every word that argues instead of informs. Cut capitals used for emphasis. `Deliberately not a loop` and `the whole point of` give a reader nothing to act on.
- Do not write the history of the change into the code. Put that in the commit message or the PR. A comment must not record:
  - how you reached the answer
  - what the code was before
  - which bug it closed
  - what a measurement showed
  - what a reviewer asked for
- An issue number is not a reason to add a comment. Add one only inside a comment that already earns its place.
- These rules beat local convention. Much of this tree is over-commented, so follow the rule and not the neighbours.
- Apply this to comments you write or change. Leave unrelated comments alone, for the reason `## Formatting` gives against repository-wide reformatting.

## GitHub text

- Always use an input file for multiline PR bodies and comments: `gh pr create/edit --body-file …` and `gh pr comment --body-file …`. Never embed escaped `\n` sequences in `--body`.

## Public README

`README.md` is the product page for GitHub and for self-hosters. Keep it current.

Update `README.md` in the same change when you:

- add or remove a feature that a user sees. This includes the reader, cloze, Anki, the tutor, import, and listen.
- add or remove a language pack, or change what a pack includes
- change deploy: image name, ports, Compose services, or a required env var
- change auth, `LECTOR_MODE`, backups, or the adopt-local-data flow

Do not put agent-only or contributor-only material in `README.md`. Put the folder styleguide, OpenAPI generation, and the local two-process setup in `CONTRIBUTING.md`. Put long operator notes in `deploy/README.md`.

Lead with Docker Compose. Do not lead with `npm run`. Do not describe Lector as an Afrikaans-only reader. Afrikaans is the first language pack, not the product.

After a README edit, run the STE linter on `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and `deploy/README.md`.
