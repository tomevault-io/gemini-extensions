# livediagram

Monorepo for the livediagram product. Multiple apps share code through internal packages.

## Before you start

- `git fetch` latest from origin

## Organisation process

This section describes the process of organising and layering empirical information.
It guides the engineering efforts by having agents specify with sufficient detail.
The goal is for agents to become increasingly self-sufficient when working on systems they already know.

This is achieved by iteratively capturing contextual information about the domain and documenting intentions from humans.

This section is exclusively human-hand-written; agents MUST NOT edit this section directly.

### Structure

Use the following structure and rationale.

- `AGENTS.md` instructs us about **how we work**.
- `plans/` contains plans; **exhaustive list of checkboxed steps**.
- `docs/` holds all **documentation** files.
- `docs/README.md` is the entry point.

Within `docs/` are the following special categories:

- `specs/` contains **specifications**: _what a thing IS_.
- `specs/[...]/blueprints/` contains **blueprints**: _exhaustively documented implementation details_.
- `instructions/` contains **instruction sets**: _empirically built repeatable processes_.

**Indexes** are held inside `README.md` files. Entries look like: `- ./<file>.md - when <trigger>`.
`README.md` files open with `Follow the references below only as needed; never upfront.`

Further details below.

### Docs

- Docs are structured as `docs/<category>/<topic>.md`
- They are indexed under `docs/README.md`.
- The docs index includes entry points to `specs` and `instructions`.
- Docs convey information in scope of the project.
- All docs SHOULD be treated as persistent documents that can be iterated on.
- Stay cognizant of the deltas of each change.
- Reuse documents where it makes sense.
- Folders of substance SHOULD hold a `README.md` with an index.
- Docs, indexes and references **MUST be continuously kept-up-to-date** throughout all work.

### Plans

- Plans live as a single Markdown file in the main checkout's `plans/` folder, numbered `0001-<topic>.md`.
- They live inside the `plans/` folder, which MAY be **gitignored** (recommended).
- Plans describe **work**, split into sequenced **phases** of checkboxed **steps**:.
  - **work** includes research, specification, building, testing, verification, definition of done, and anything else that's needed.
  - **phases** are logical increments, warranting a commit each.
  - **steps** MUST be performed with full focus, and in the highest qualitative and idiomatic way.
  - **checkboxes** MUST be checked off immediately upon completion of any step, and before starting the next step.
- A plan MAY link to blueprints and specs (encouraged), but SHALL NOT restate them.
- The last step of every plan MUST be **fold-back**; to let the documentation reflect reality, and to verify all symbols/files/references.
- Fold-back reconciles the spec to what actually shipped, then re-derives the blueprint from it.
- Plans SHALL NOT be renumbered.

**When to use plans?**

- Default to no plan. Just do the work for tasks that fit in a single sitting.
- Create a plan when asked or when work is likely to exceed one or two days.
- Surface ambiguities and gaps before implementing, and keep refining the plan as new information arrives.

**Work plans one task at a time**

1. Read the step,
2. Do it the best, highest qualitative and idiomatic way possible
3. Upon completion immediately tick the checkbox; never batch ticks at the end.
4. Then move to the next step.

_Note:_ There is no need to stop in between phases; just keep going.

### Specs

- Specs live inside numbered **category folders** `docs/specs/NNN-<category>/`.
- They are indexed under `docs/specs/README.md`.
- Specs are where design decisions are made and recorded.
- Specs describe **what a thing IS** within the domain; the definitions and specifications of **systems** or **domain concepts**.
- Specs are written in the present tense.
- Specs themselves are unnumbered.
- Specs are never task lists and carry no checkboxes.
- Spec files SHOULD be unnumbered and named by subject; a category MAY hold several related specs.
- Write the spec BEFORE implementing anything non-trivial, and keep it true afterwards.
- Iterate the existing spec rather than adding one on the same subject; stay cognizant of each delta.

**Category folders**

- The first five categories are reserved:
  - `001-project-vision` - the "why": problem, target audience, value proposition.
  - `002-project-scope` - the "what" and "what-not": features, high-level outline, technical constraints, non-goals.
  - `003-system-architecture` - the "how" underneath: data flow, infrastructure, state, language/runtime boundaries.
  - `004-interface-design` - the "how" at the surface: UX/UI, wireframes, user journeys, visual language.
  - `005-project-roadmap` - the "when": milestones as outcomes, phases, launch strategy.
- Further category folders MUST BE named after a **system** or, preferably, a **domain concept**.
- Renumbering is discouraged, but allowed when every reference to it is updated in the same change.

### Blueprints

- Blueprints live in a `blueprints/` folder inside their spec's category folder `docs/specs/NNN-<category>/blueprints/`,
- They are indexed under `docs/specs/NNN-<category>/blueprints/README.md`.
- Blueprints are the meticulously detailed natural language source holding all implementation details, written before the code exists.
- Derive the blueprint mechanically from the spec before building; it adds engineering precision, not new design.
- Derivation is one-directional and deterministic: the spec is the input, the blueprint the output.
- Change flows in one-direction and is deterministic: a spec change updates the blueprint and then the code.
- Any changes outside that are folded back into the spec and blueprint.
- Blueprints do not invent design; if the spec is ambiguous, fix the spec first rather than guess.
- Iterate existing blueprints, never rewrite: change only what the spec changed; stay cognizant of the delta.
- Blueprints SHOULD apply documented defaults, one row per default in the category's `blueprints/DEFAULTS.md`.
- A blueprint is complete only when every applicable **completeness category** is covered and checked off in `blueprints/COMPLETENESS.md`

**Completeness categories**

- **Domain and naming** - every domain term maps to one canonical identifier; synonyms are banned.
- **Behaviour and state** - every state, transition, guard, and invariant is named and reachable.
- **Interfaces and contracts** - every input and output is typed and validated, with a named rejection per failure.
- **Data and persistence** - every field is classified; snapshot, restore, and migration are defined.
- **Errors and edge cases** - every failure mode and boundary case is named with its handling; no silent path.
- **Security and trust** - trust boundaries, abuse cases, guards, rate limits etc. are stated.
- **Performance and limits** - worst-case sizes and hot-path budgets are computed against the platform limits.
- **Presentation and UX** (UI only) - layout, empty, loading, and error states, and final copy are defined.
- **Accessibility** (UI only) - contrast, ARIA, keyboard, and reduced motion meet WCAG 2.2 AA.
- **Web Experience** (Web only) - Core Web Vitals, including LCP, INP and CLS are explicitly addressed.
- **Observability** - every decision point and failure emits a log with a recognisable fingerprint.
- **Testing** - every spec rule maps to a deterministic test, traceably.
- **Constants and configuration** - every magic number is a named constant with provenance and a safe range.
- **Assets and external resources** - every asset has a source, a licence, a path, and reproducible generation.
- **Defaults ledger** - every default applied for a silent or qualitative spec has a ledger row.

Record each blueprint's applicable categories in the committed `blueprints/COMPLETENESS.md`, one line each:

- [x] Domain and naming
- [x] Behaviour and state
- [x] Testing
- [x] Defaults

Leave out any category that does not apply; unchecked means applicable but not covered.

### Instruction sets

- Instruction sets live in `docs/instructions/<process>.md`, unnumbered and named after the process they encode.
- They are indexed under `docs/instructions/README.md`.
- Instruction sets are **reusable process memory**: _how a process is done_, not scoped to one piece of work.
- Instruction sets carry no checkboxes; a plan MAY link to one, and progress is ticked in the plan.
- Steps are **chronological**; ordered the way the work is actually done, not grouped by theme.
- Steps are **granular**; each is small enough that "did it happen?" has a yes or no answer.
- Steps are **opinionated**; taste, preferences and domain specifics are woven in, not left to model defaults.
- Surface only **genuine forks** (taste, preference, business knowledge); write every other decision down once.
- Instruction sets grow **empirically**; gotchas, hard gained knowledge, user input or missed steps are folded back in.

## Specs are the source of truth

- Before building or proposing anything, **check `docs/specs/`** ([index](docs/specs/README.md)).
- Every product decision, feature, constraint and rule lives in `docs/specs/`.

Workflow:

- New feature, scope change, or rule → write or update a spec **first**, code second.
- Capture each user request in a spec before writing code, filed in its category folder.
- Reference specs by filename in PRs and discussions.
- If specs and code disagree, that's a bug — usually the spec is right; if not, fix the spec first.

## Keep docs and the README current

The root [`README.md`](README.md) and the [`docs/`](docs/) folder (indexed in [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md)) are developer- and user-facing documentation, distinct from the product specs in `docs/specs/`.

Treat them as part of the change, not an afterthought:

- After any change, check whether it makes the README or a `docs/` file **incorrect** (commands, ports, file paths, env vars, app/package names, architecture, deploy steps) or **lacking key information** (a new app, package, env var, command, route, or workflow that a reader would now expect to find). If so, update the affected doc in the **same change** as the code.
- Adding or removing an app, package, env var, command, route, or build/deploy step is a strong signal that `README.md`, `docs/development/architecture.md`, `docs/development/local-development.md`, and `docs/operations/self-hosting.md` may need a matching edit.
- Don't let docs drift: an out-of-date doc is worse than a missing one. If you can't fully update it now, note the gap explicitly rather than leaving a confidently wrong instruction.
- Specs (`docs/specs/`) remain the source of truth for product decisions; `docs/` explains how to understand, run, and contribute to the code. Keep both honest.

## Help centre articles must stay registered

Whenever you add, remove or rename a help article, follow [`docs/instructions/register-a-help-article.md`](docs/instructions/register-a-help-article.md) in the same change; an unregistered article is a bug.

Workspaces are managed with **pnpm** (`pnpm-workspace.yaml`). Tasks are orchestrated with **Turborepo** (`turbo.json`). Node `>=22` (wrangler 4 requirement), pnpm `>=9`.

## What's built, what's still ahead

- Built: see [Build phase](docs/specs/005-project-roadmap/prototype-scope.md#where-we-are-now).
- Still ahead: see [Next and Later](docs/specs/005-project-roadmap/prototype-scope.md#next).

## Open source

See [Open source + distribution](docs/specs/002-project-scope/open-source-and-business-model.md).

- The codebase is **MIT-licensed** and **publicly viewable**. Anyone can self-host.
- A free hosted version runs alongside at livediagram.app. **No paid tier and no plan to introduce one.**
- Don't add code that breaks self-hosting (no required SaaS calls, no license checks gating the core editor). Clerk auth is optional: when unset the api worker and live frontend degrade to pure-guest mode.
- No "Pro features" flags, no billing integration. If we ship it, every user gets it.

## Secrets policy

See [Secrets policy](docs/specs/002-project-scope/secrets-policy.md). **Repo is public — no secrets in source. Ever.**

- All secrets via env vars: `.env.local` (gitignored) for dev, `wrangler secret put` for Workers, dashboard env vars for Pages.
- Client bundles only carry values explicitly prefixed `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` and only when documented as publishable (e.g. Clerk publishable key).
- Server-only secrets (Clerk secret key, Resend, D1 access) never appear in client code.
- Each app/worker that needs env vars ships a `.env.example` documenting what's required.

## Auth model

See [Auth + guest access](docs/specs/014-identity/auth-and-guest-access.md).

- **The canvas always works without signing in.** Friction-free engagement is the acquisition strategy. Never put a sign-in wall in front of the editor.
- **Hybrid identity** — the api accepts two equivalent ways of identifying the owner of a request:
  - **Guest path**: a per-browser participant id (`livediagram:v2:self-id` in `localStorage`) carried as `X-Owner-Id`. Default for unsigned visitors. Full feature set (persistence, share links, real-time collab).
  - **Authed path**: a Clerk session JWT in `Authorization: Bearer <token>`, verified via `CLERK_JWKS_URL`.
  - The api worker uses the `sub` claim as the owner id.
- The two paths coexist forever — a signed-in user can still hand a share link to a guest who edits without auth.
- Sign-in lives at `/sign-in/` and sign-up at `/get-started/` (custom UI; email-code or Google OAuth). On sign-up, guest documents migrate from the localStorage id to the Clerk user id via `POST /api/migrate`.

## Core principle: reuse over duplication

**Avoid duplication. Build things in reusable ways from the start.** Non-negotiable.

- Before writing something new, check `packages/` for an existing shared module — extend it rather than recreating it.
- If two apps need the same thing (UI component, util, type, schema, API client, validator, config), it lives in `packages/`, not copied into each app.
- If you find yourself copy-pasting code across apps or packages, stop and extract it. "I'll dedupe later" is how drift starts.
- Design package APIs to be consumed by multiple callers — generic enough to reuse, specific enough to be useful.
- Tailwind theme, ESLint, Prettier, TS config, and shared UI primitives all live in `packages/` for exactly this reason.

When the right place for code is genuinely unclear, default to `packages/`.

## Core principle: no god files, plan placement first

**Decide where code belongs before you write it. Never accrete into god files.** Non-negotiable.

- **Prefer small, cohesive files; extract on cohesion, not on a line count.**
- Pull a slice into its own module the moment it's independently meaningful, even under any threshold.
- **Soft target: keep source files under ~400 lines.** Crossing it is a prompt to extract a cohesive slice.
- Never hit the target by deleting explanatory comments; bring the number down by moving real code.
- A file past ~1000 lines is almost certainly doing too much and must be broken up.
- **Pure data is exempt from the line target.** A flat catalogue stays a single file however long it gets.
- Split a data file only when it genuinely holds two _different_ catalogues that deserve separate homes.
- **A fully-decomposed orchestration root is exempt like pure data**; its bar is cohesion, not the number.
- `useEditorState.ts` and `Canvas.tsx` already sit large; extract new slices out of them rather than adding in.
- A new dialog / page / overlay → its **own component file** (e.g. `components/chrome/ApiErrorPage.tsx`), not another branch inside an existing screen.
- New behaviour or a slice of state → its **own hook** (`useXxx.ts`), then composed in. Editor state lives in domain slices, not piled into one hook.
- When you add to an existing file, confirm it's the _cohesive_ home, not just the convenient one. Wire new pieces in with the smallest edit to the host file.
- If a file is drifting toward a "kitchen sink", stop and extract — the same way duplication gets extracted on first sight (see the reuse principle above).

## Hard constraints

- **All websites must be static and deployable to Cloudflare Pages.** Next.js apps use `output: 'export'` — no SSR, no Node runtime, no Next API routes (use a Cloudflare Worker), no server-required image loader.
- Server-side logic lives in Cloudflare Workers, **not** in Next.js. Frontends call those Workers.
- Database access goes through a Worker that holds the D1 binding — never from the browser.

## Tech stack

See [Architecture](docs/development/architecture.md#tech-stack).

## Deployment

See [Deployment](docs/specs/016-platform/deployment.md) and [Staging environment](docs/specs/016-platform/staging-environment.md).

- When you touch a worker's bindings, add the same change to its `[env.staging]` block; `pnpm staging:check` verifies it.

## Guidelines

- Don't add SSR, Next.js API routes, or Node-only runtime code to a frontend app — it will break Cloudflare Pages deploys.
- Put any logic shared by two or more apps in `packages/` rather than copying it.
- This is a public repo, rely on CI rather than running full E2E locally before a PR
- Worker apps target the Cloudflare Workers runtime — prefer Web APIs (`fetch`, `Request`, `Response`, `crypto.subtle`) over Node-only APIs.
- D1 schemas and migrations (when they arrive) live with the Worker that owns the binding.
- The router worker (`apps/router`) holds **no business logic** — only routing. If you're tempted to add logic to it, that logic belongs in the service it forwards to.
- **Track key new functionality** via the anonymous-events schema ([spec](docs/specs/017-telemetry/telemetry.md)).
- A feature that meaningfully changes user behaviour gets a one-liner `track(category, action, type)` in its handler.
- Reuse the closed `TELEMETRY_CATEGORIES` / `TELEMETRY_ACTIONS` enums; extend them only when no existing pair fits.
- The `type` is a preset enum value (e.g., `Square`, `DrawToAddOn`), never user content.
- Settings flips fire BEFORE the change is persisted so an opt-out event still reaches the wire.
