# Pure HTML + Bootstrap Website

## Project Philosophy

This project is intentionally simple. The goal is a **production-ready, maintainable website with zero build tools, zero dependencies to install, and zero framework complexity**. Anyone with basic HTML knowledge should be able to edit it. It should work indefinitely without updates, run on any host including shared hosting, and be easy to hand off.

**When in doubt, do less. Simpler is always preferred.**

## Stack

| Concern | Tool | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Structure | Plain HTML5 | No build step, universally understood |
| Styling | Bootstrap 5 via CDN | Stable, small, well-documented |
| Icons | Bootstrap Icons via CDN | Consistent with Bootstrap, lightweight |
| JavaScript | Vanilla JS only | No npm, no bundler, no framework |
| Fonts | System font stack | Zero external requests, fast |

### CDN URLs (pin these versions, do not auto-upgrade)

```html
<!-- Bootstrap CSS -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css">

<!-- Bootstrap Icons -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap-icons@1.11.3/font/bootstrap-icons.min.css">

<!-- Bootstrap JS (only include if interactive components are needed) -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script>
```

> **Important:** Always pin exact versions. Never use `@latest`. CDN URLs should only change when there is a deliberate decision to upgrade.

## HTML Rules

- Every page must have a valid `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration
- Every page must have `<html lang="en">` (adjust language code as needed)
- Every page must have a unique, descriptive `<title>` tag
- Every page must have a `<meta name="description">` tag
- Every page must include `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">`
- Semantic HTML elements are preferred: `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`
- Never use `<div>` where a semantic element is appropriate
- All images must have descriptive `alt` attributes — never leave `alt` empty unless purely decorative
- All pages must share the same `<header>` and `<footer>` structure for consistency

### Page Template

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
  <meta name="description" content="Page description here">
  <title>Page Title — Site Name</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap-icons@1.11.3/font/bootstrap-icons.min.css">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">
</head>
<body>

  <header>
    <nav class="navbar navbar-expand-lg navbar-light bg-white border-bottom">
      <!-- nav content -->
    </nav>
  </header>

  <main>
    <!-- page content -->
  </main>

  <footer class="bg-light border-top py-4 mt-5">
    <!-- footer content -->
  </footer>

  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script>
  <script src="js/main.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

## CSS Rules

- Bootstrap utility classes are preferred over writing custom CSS
- `style.css` is for **overrides and custom components only** — not for reimplementing what Bootstrap already provides
- Never use `!important` unless absolutely unavoidable — if you need it, reconsider the approach
- CSS custom properties (variables) are preferred for brand colors and repeated values
- Mobile-first. Use Bootstrap's responsive utilities. Test at 375px, 768px, and 1280px minimum
- No inline styles except for truly dynamic values set via JavaScript

### Recommended CSS Variables

```css
:root {
  --color-primary: #your-brand-color;
  --color-secondary: #your-secondary-color;
  --color-text: #212529;
  --color-muted: #6c757d;
  --font-body: system-ui, -apple-system, sans-serif;
}
```

---

## JavaScript Rules

- Vanilla JS only. No jQuery, no Alpine, no Vue, no React
- Bootstrap's built-in JS handles modals, dropdowns, accordions — use it before writing custom JS
- `main.js` should be small. If it grows beyond ~100 lines, question whether the feature belongs in a pure HTML site
- No JS should be required for the page to be readable and navigable — JS is enhancement only
- Always use `addEventListener`, never inline `onclick` attributes in HTML
- Always wrap DOM-dependent code in `DOMContentLoaded`

```js
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
  // your code here
});
```

---

## Forms & Contact

- For contact forms, use a third-party form service (Formspree, Netlify Forms, Web3Forms)
- No server-side code. No PHP mailers. No backend
- Always include basic client-side validation using HTML5 attributes (`required`, `type="email"`, etc.)
- Never collect more data than necessary

---

## Images

- Compress all images before adding to the project (use Squoosh or similar)
- Prefer WebP format with JPEG fallback for broad compatibility
- Never commit unoptimized images
- Use descriptive filenames: `team-photo-jakarta.webp` not `IMG_4823.webp`
- For decorative images (backgrounds, patterns), use CSS where possible instead of `<img>`

---

## Performance Targets

- PageSpeed Insights score: **90+ on mobile**
- No render-blocking resources beyond the pinned CDN links above
- Total page weight under **500KB** for a typical page (excluding hero images)
- No unused CSS loaded beyond Bootstrap (do not add additional CSS frameworks)

---

## Accessibility

- Color contrast must meet WCAG AA minimum (4.5:1 for body text)
- All interactive elements must be keyboard navigable
- Use `aria-label` on icon-only buttons
- Headings must follow logical order: one `<h1>` per page, then `<h2>`, `<h3>` — never skip levels

---

## What NOT to Do

- Do not install npm or any package manager
- Do not add a build step or bundler (Vite, Webpack, Parcel, etc.)
- Do not add a CSS preprocessor (Sass, Less)
- Do not add a JS framework (React, Vue, Alpine)
- Do not add Tailwind (CDN version is large and the play CDN is not production-safe)
- Do not add jQuery (Bootstrap 5 no longer needs it)
- Do not add Google Fonts unless explicitly required by brand — use system fonts first
- Do not add cookie banners, trackers, or analytics unless explicitly required
- Do not add a CMS unless the client truly cannot edit HTML — in that case, reconsider the project scope

---

## Deployment

This project deploys as **static files only**. Any host that can serve static files works:

- Shared hosting via FTP ✓
- GitHub Pages ✓
- Netlify (drag and drop) ✓
- Cloudflare Pages ✓
- Any VPS with Nginx ✓

No database. No runtime. No environment variables. No deployment pipeline required.

---

## Contributing & Forking

This starter is intentionally opinionated. If you fork it:

1. Update the CDN versions if Bootstrap releases a new stable version
2. Keep the philosophy — resist the urge to add complexity
3. Document any additions in this file

---

*Built on the principle that the best website is the one that still works without touching it five years from now.*
