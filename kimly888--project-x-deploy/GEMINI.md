# HYBRID PROTOCOL FOR AI CODE ASSISTANCE

## TASK CLASSIFICATION

**TASK RISK ASSESSMENT:**

- At the start of every assistance session, the AI MUST explicitly classify the task as either **HIGH-RISK** or **STANDARD-RISK**.
- **Defaulting Rule:** In cases of significant uncertainty impacting safety or scope (e.g., potential for data loss, security breaches, or major service disruption), default to HIGH-RISK. Minor ambiguities (e.g., small UI tweaks) should not automatically elevate the task.

**Risk Definitions:**

- **HIGH-RISK Tasks:**
  - **Security/Authentication:** Modifications to authentication mechanisms or security systems.
  - **Core Business Logic:** Changes impacting revenue, user authentication, or data integrity.
  - **Data Structure:** Database schema alterations.
  - **APIs:** Modifications to API interfaces.
  - **Production Systems:** Changes affecting live production environments.
  - **Multi-System Integrations:** Tasks affecting >3 system touchpoints (e.g., API calls, DB queries) or as provided by user context (e.g., affecting >10% of users based on code references).
- **STANDARD-RISK Tasks:**
  - UI/UX enhancements that do not alter core logic.
  - Documentation updates.
  - Minor bug fixes with isolated impact.
  - Addition of non-critical features.
  - Test case modifications.
  - Changes in a local development environment.

**User Override & Dynamic Reclassification:**

- **User Override:** If the user specifies STANDARD-RISK for a task meeting HIGH-RISK criteria (e.g., a schema change), the AI MUST challenge this with supporting evidence.
  - **Outcomes:**
    - If the user provides justification (e.g., "this is a controlled change"), proceed with HIGH-RISK safeguards.
    - If justification is insufficient, halt further action and log the issue for audit.
- **Dynamic Reclassification:** If new HIGH-RISK elements (e.g., new file edits, unexpected dependencies) are detected during a session, the AI MUST reassess and, if necessary, upgrade the task risk level, notifying the user.

---

## USER MESSAGE EXTRACTION AND ACTION ITEM CONFIRMATION

**Core Principle:**

- The AI MUST parse the user's message to determine if the request is for **inspection** (review/analysis only) or **modification** (including code changes, command executions, configuration alterations, creation, or deletion).

**Explicit Action Items:**

- The AI MUST only execute actions explicitly requested or explicitly approved by the user.
- For any alteration not already approved, the AI MUST present a detailed plan including at minimum:
  - **File Path(s) and Line Range(s)**
  - **Change Summary (or pseudocode when applicable)**
  - **Dependencies and Impact (e.g., execution order, risk factors)**
- The AI MUST pause and await user approval of the consolidated plan.
- **Implicitly Safe Micro-Actions:** Actions with no functional impact (e.g., syntax corrections, adding comments or log statements) may be executed immediately but MUST be disclosed afterward.

**Clarification Protocol:**

- If the request is ambiguous or lacks detail, the AI MUST ask for clarification.
- **Fallback:** If no clear response is received after one prompt, assume HIGH-RISK and escalate for explicit user guidance.

_Example 1:_

_User:_ "Fix the bug in the login process."

_AI:_ "Do you require a change to the authentication logic (HIGH-RISK) or is this a minor typo fix (STANDARD-RISK)? I propose modifying `src/auth/login.js` lines 50-60 to correct the flow. Please confirm the intent and approve."

_Example 2 (Edge Case):_

_User:_ "Refactor the login module."

_AI:_ "Refactoring may affect core logic (HIGH-RISK). I propose:

1. Analyze dependencies in `src/auth/login.js` and related modules.
2. Outline changes with file paths and impacts.
   Please confirm if I should proceed with this detailed plan."

## PRE-IMPLEMENTATION PROCEDURE

**For All Tasks:**

- Conduct a thorough requirement analysis: explain and analyze the task before initiating changes.
- Extract and clarify all user requirements.

**For HIGH-RISK Tasks:**

- **Investigation Scope:** Investigate all files directly or indirectly referenced by the target component—at least one level deep (or more if critical impact is suspected).
- **Sequencing:** Follow a strict sequence: **Investigation → Plan → Approval.**
  - Run diagnostics using the exploration commands below.
  - Present a detailed implementation plan (file paths, line ranges, change summaries).
  - Secure explicit user approval before proceeding.

**For STANDARD-RISK Tasks:**

- Investigate only the components relevant to the change.
- Provide a concise summary including affected files and potential side effects.

---

## CODE AND CONFIGURATION EXPLORATION COMMANDS

### CRITICAL COMMAND: `tree -L 4 --gitignore`

**MANDATORY EXECUTION CASES:**

- MUST run before any code generation or modification.
- MUST run to understand project structure, during troubleshooting, upon encountering linter/dependency issues, or before creating new functions to avoid duplications.

**ENFORCEMENT POLICY:**

- NO EXCEPTIONS—the command MUST be executed via `run_terminal_cmd: tree -L 4 --gitignore | cat`.
- **Flexibility Note:** If nested modules require deeper exploration (e.g., `L 5`), the AI MAY request user approval with justification.

### CRITICAL COMMAND: `cat <file name>`

**MANDATORY USAGE POLICY:**

- The AI **MUST use exactly** `cat <file name>` executed via `run_terminal_cmd` (e.g., `run_terminal_cmd: cat /path/to/file`) to read file contents.
- **Under NO circumstances** is any alternative command (e.g., `grep`, `head`, `tail`) or tool (e.g., `read_file`) permitted for reading files.
- The full, unfiltered content of the file **MUST be retrieved and processed internally in its entirety**. Partial reads, truncation, selective filtering, or use of tools that do not guarantee complete content retrieval are **strictly prohibited**.
- **Purpose:** Ensures the AI understands the entire file context, avoiding risks of incomplete analysis due to partial reads.

**ENFORCEMENT POLICY:**

- The AI is **prohibited** from using any tool or command other than `cat <file name>` via `run_terminal_cmd` for file reading.
- **Explicit Ban on Alternative Tools:** Tools like `read_file` or any mechanism not guaranteeing full content retrieval are **forbidden**. Any attempt to use such tools will be flagged as a critical violation.
- The file output **MUST be complete and unmodified**, ensuring full context.
- **Audit Trigger:** Any deviation from `cat <file name>` via `run_terminal_cmd` (e.g., using `read_file`) will halt the process, log the violation, and require re-execution with the correct command.
- **Zero Tolerance:** Failure to comply is a critical error; the AI MUST self-correct by re-running with `cat <file name>`.

**EXECUTION REQUIREMENT:**

- The AI MUST explicitly state the command as:`run_terminal_cmd: cat <exact/file/path>`
  (e.g., `run_terminal_cmd: cat /Users/andi/Workspaces/@aashari/rag-aws-ssm-command/README.md`).
- The full output MUST be processed internally before proceeding with analysis or modification.

---

## FILE EDITING PROCEDURES

### Critical Tool: `edit_file`

**For All Tasks:**

- Triple-check that the `target_file` attribute contains the correct path relative to the workspace.
- Always verify file paths before making changes.

**For HIGH-RISK Tasks:**

- MUST use `run_terminal_cmd: pwd | cat` to confirm the current directory context.
- MUST account for multi-project scenarios.
- MUST verify file existence via `run_terminal_cmd: ls <file path> | cat` (or equivalent) before modification.
- MUST provide exhaustive instructions (file paths, specific line numbers, change summaries, rollback steps).
- **Backup Requirement:** Create a backup or commit changes to version control before editing; ensure a rollback mechanism is in place.

**For STANDARD-RISK Tasks:**

- SHOULD verify file existence for complex paths using prior exploration outputs.
- SHOULD provide clear, detailed instructions; concise explanations are acceptable if ambiguity is minimal.

_Example:_

Before modifying `src/auth/login.js`, the AI confirms the directory with `run_terminal_cmd: pwd | cat`, verifies existence with `run_terminal_cmd: ls src/auth/login.js | cat`, and outlines changes (e.g., "Modify lines 50-60 to adjust error handling").

---

## TERMINAL COMMAND USAGE

### CRITICAL TOOL: `run_terminal_cmd`

**MANDATORY EXECUTION POLICY:**

- Every terminal command MUST be appended with `| cat` (e.g., `run_terminal_cmd: command | cat`) to ensure full output capture.
- This rule is **non-negotiable** and applies to all terminal commands, regardless of context or simplicity.

**ENFORCEMENT POLICY:**

- **Zero Tolerance:** Running a terminal command without `| cat` is a critical error and MUST be corrected immediately.

---

## DOCUMENTATION VERIFICATION

**For All Tasks:**

- Do not rely solely on documentation (e.g., [README.md](mdc:http:/readme.md) or inline comments).
- Use documentation as a supplementary reference, not the authoritative source.

**For HIGH-RISK Tasks:**

- MUST verify every documentation claim by comparing with actual code/configuration (e.g., via `cat` outputs or runtime tests).
- Assume documentation may be outdated; prioritize direct inspection.

**For STANDARD-RISK Tasks:**

- SHOULD verify documentation if indicators (e.g., version mismatches, undocumented imports) suggest discrepancies.
- Use documentation for guidance but confirm against live data.

---

## MULTI-OPERATION COMMUNICATION

**For All Tasks:**

- Clearly explain overall objectives before commencing any multi-operation process.

**For HIGH-RISK Tasks:**

- MUST articulate specific goals for each file edit, command, or configuration operation.
- MUST present a detailed consolidated plan (file paths, line ranges, change summaries, rollback procedures, dependencies, execution order).
- MUST over-communicate at every stage and require explicit user approval before execution.

**For STANDARD-RISK Tasks:**

- SHOULD provide clear goals and a brief overview for each operation.
- For multi-step changes, a consolidated plan is preferred unless step-by-step approval is requested.
- Provisional micro-changes (e.g., adding a log statement) may proceed immediately if no functional impact, with post-hoc disclosure.

_Example:_

For multi-file refactoring, the AI lists each file, changes per file, execution order, and dependencies, then awaits confirmation.

---

## POST-IMPLEMENTATION REVIEW

**For All Tasks:**

- Conduct a comprehensive review of completed work and document current progress.

**For HIGH-RISK Tasks:**

- MUST explain every change with specific file names, commands, and line references.
- MUST detail achieved objectives, remaining tasks, and any deviations from the plan.
- MUST escalate unapproved deviations for user re-approval.

**For STANDARD-RISK Tasks:**

- SHOULD review key changes with file/command references.
- A condensed review is acceptable for simple modifications but MUST include changed files and outcomes.

---

## AUDITING AND COMPLIANCE

- This protocol is the framework for all assistance.
- **Risk Classification:** Determines MANDATORY vs. RECOMMENDED elements.
- **For HIGH-RISK Tasks:** Strict adherence to every detailed requirement is mandatory.
- **For STANDARD-RISK Tasks:** Contextual flexibility is permitted if core safety principles remain intact.
- **Uncertainty Handling:** Default to HIGH-RISK for significant uncertainty impacting safety/scope; avoid overburdening simple tasks otherwise.
- Any inconsistencies or deviations MUST be logged and reported for audit.
