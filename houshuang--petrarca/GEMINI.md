# Petrarca — Intelligent Read-Later App

A mobile-first read-later app combining incremental reading, user knowledge modeling, and algorithmic article selection. Named after Francesco Petrarca, pioneer of systematic reading methods. Built for one power user (Stian), not a social platform.

**Frontend**: Expo SDK 54 (React Native), 2-tab layout (Feed / Library) + ✦ drawer. **Backend**: Hetzner VM — nginx (:8083 content, :8084 web), research-server.py (:8090), 4-hour cron pipeline. **Data**: SQLite (petrarca.db, canonical), JSON fallback.

## Design Principles & North Star

These principles are the intellectual foundation of the project. They override implementation convenience. Read the linked docs when making design decisions beyond bug fixes.

1. **"Hooks, not facts."** Reading success = building frameworks (Caesar, Alexander, Charlemagne), not fact-drilling. The system builds scaffold knowledge that makes everything you read richer. *(research/design-vision.md)*

2. **"I'll manage your memory."** The fear of forgetting stops reading nonfiction. Like Michel Thomas: the system takes responsibility for retention so the user can focus on reading. Frame knowledge maps as positive progress, never anxiety-inducing gaps. *(memory/feedback_michel_thomas.md)*

3. **Comprehension before memory.** Ensure understanding before testing (Matuschak's key finding). SRS-style flashcards fail for conceptual knowledge — we need elaborative retrieval, connection-based resurfacing, spreading activation. *(research/andy-matuschak-research.md, research/beyond-flashcards-knowledge-retention.md)*

4. **Atomic claims are the fundamental unit.** Not articles, not words. Claims enable cross-article tracking, knowledge state management, and novelty detection. Delta-only reports show what's new since last read. *(research/novelty-system-architecture.md)*

5. **Curriculum as bridge.** Don't match claims directly across sources. Curriculum nodes (50-80 per domain, Opus-generated) are the organizing principle — they connect books, articles, and review into a coherent structure. *(research/overlapping-curricula-vision.md)*

6. **Temporal hooks are the key retention mechanism.** Priority: (1) anchor to known events, (2) same-moment connections, (3) causal chains, (4) cross-domain surprises only if the reader knows the other domain. *(memory/feedback_temporal_hooks.md)*

7. **Facts first, then concepts.** Dates, key figures, key events are load-bearing scaffolding. Generate factual questions DETERMINISTICALLY from structured `key_facts` data. Only use LLM for rich answers and analytical questions. Never delegate to LLM what can be computed from structure. *(memory/feedback_rules.md § Knowledge System Design)*

8. **Books encode, system maintains.** Books provide initial encoding through narrative/structure. Maintaining and integrating knowledge is the system's job. Not SRS — but real decay exists. Voice dumps as knowledge elicitation. *(memory/feedback_knowledge_encoding.md)*

9. **Curiosity zone at 70% novelty.** Articles with ~70% novel claims + ~30% familiar context are most engaging (zone of proximal development). "Most novel" ≠ "most interesting." *(research/experiment-results-report.md)*

10. **Dim familiar, don't hide.**

11. **Cards are mini-encyclopedias.** Microlearning card content MUST include primary sources (who wrote about this), material evidence (what survives, where to visit), and cultural artifacts (art, opera, literature). Follow-up queries go SIDEWAYS (geography, counter-narratives, structural causes) — not deeper into what the card already said. Familiar paragraphs at 0.55 opacity, not hidden. Constrained highlighting (150 words) improves comprehension 11-19% over highlighting everything (CHI 2024). *(research/knowledge-diff-interfaces.md)*

**Flag design drift proactively.** If implementation diverges from these principles, raise it before the user discovers it.

## Working on This Codebase

This project is exploratory — 60+ sessions in many directions. That means:

1. **There is stale code.** Dead imports, unused tables, deprecated modules. Don't assume everything exists for a reason. Verify before building on it.
2. **Trace data flows before changing them.** Where does it write → what store → who reads → what displays? Critical bugs came from write/read mismatches (JSON vs SQLite).
3. **Test endpoints before telling user to test.** `curl` with realistic data after server changes. Deploy mobile after client changes. "It should work" is not verification.
4. **Clean up what you touch.** Remove dead code, unused imports, stale data when you encounter them.
5. **Diagnose before patching.** Read the full error, check concurrency, understand architecture. One correct fix beats four incremental attempts.

## Critical Rules

### Data Store Discipline
- **SQLite is the ONLY data store** for knowledge states, review items, and all runtime data
- **Review stream pipeline**: `generate_question()` → `cached_question` JSON on `knowledge_items` (includes rich_answer, memory_hook, 6 follow_up_queries via Gemini Flash, quiz_suggestions from key_facts) → `generate_review_stream()` in `curriculum_db.py` assembles cards (with nexus cards + related_facts checklist + existing_quizzes listing) → client `review.tsx`. Microlearning cards flow separately: `_run_microlearning_research()` → `microlearning_cards` table → mixed into stream.
- **Multi-cue quiz generation**: On grading a knowledge_item, background thread calls `generate_multicue_quizzes()` → Gemini Flash generates 2-4 alternate retrieval cues per key_fact (date/event/person types only). All cues for one fact share `fact_id` + `rich_answer` (shared detail card). Dedup at 0.82 cosine via limbic. Suspend all cues for a fact via `POST /review/suspend-fact`.
- **Review card features**: ⋯ menu (About this card, Bad question, Suspend), origin badge (📖/🔗/🎙/🔍), instant fade transitions, session-tracked graded IDs (no re-showing within 60s), generic entity filtering (`_GENERIC_ENTITIES`), "Same topic" related_facts checklist, factual quiz suggestions (fire-and-forget creation via QuizSuggestions component), "Quizzes for this topic" existing quiz listing. Card provenance data (origin, scores, scheduling state) attached to every card from server.
- **Review scheduling**: FSRS-6 via py-fsrs (`desired_retention=0.80`, `learning_steps=()`). Grade mapping: knew→Easy (~28d), partly→Good (~8d), missed→Again (~1d). All scheduling tables have `fsrs_card_json` column. **ALL scheduling MUST go through `record_answer()` or `_fsrs_reschedule()`** — never raw SQL arithmetic on `stability_days`/`due_at`.
- **Review scheduling priority**: SR cards first (book-sourced highest, gap-fill penalized -5.0 and capped at 3/batch). ML cards interleaved by `source_type`: voice_wondering/correction at 1:3, follow_up at 1:7. Never front-load ML cards.
- **Voice elicitation → knowledge_items**: `run_voice_elicitation()` creates knowledge_items for nodes that don't have one yet (14-day initial stability). Uses `confidence_tagged` to create `correction` ML cards for wrong facts. Does NOT create ML cards from missed facts (user prefers reading to fill gaps).
- **Voice capture dedup**: `process_voice_capture()` checks SHA-256 hash of transcript text before processing — prevents duplicate ingestion of same podcast/voice note.
- **Interaction logging**: Dual-layer via `/log/events` endpoint — SQLite `interaction_log` table + JSONL files. Server-side logging on both grading endpoints. Client sends via `logger.ts` to `:8090/log/events`.
- **Multi-domain chapter mapping**: `create_review_items_for_chapter()` maps against top-2-3 curricula (similarity >= 0.40), not just one domain. Cross-curriculum context + temporal cross-refs injected into question generation.
- **Book pre-scan**: `GET /book/prescan/{book_id}` shows known/new/missing nodes + cross-book overlaps.
- **`curriculum_db.py`** for ALL runtime reads/writes. **`curriculum.py`** is ONLY for generation/CLI.
- **Knowledge levels only upgrade**: unknown → mentioned → engaged → anchored. Never downgrade.
- **Server-first**: All data lives on server. Local storage is cache only.

### Deploy
- **Commit + push first**, then `bash ~/src/expo/scripts/deploy.sh petrarca`
- **After ANY `app/` change**: deploy mobile immediately
- **Web**: `bash app/deploy-web.sh` (optional, for cache busting)
- **NEVER**: rsync to server, `git clean` on server, skip `deploy.sh`
- See `memory/feedback_rules.md` for full deploy details and anti-patterns

### Interaction Logging
- ALL user interactions via `logEvent()` from `app/data/logger.ts`
- Every screen MUST call `setFeedbackContext()` on focus/mount
- New screens: add `setFeedbackContext({ screen: 'screen-name' })` in `useFocusEffect` or `useEffect`

### Pipeline Testing
- Use `scripts/pipeline-tests/run.py` when iterating on prompts/models/extraction
- Always run relevant fixtures before AND after changes

### Research Organization
- ALL research in `research/`, linked from `research/README.md`
- `research/experiment-log.md` is **append-only** — new entries at top, log BEFORE making changes

### LLM Calling Discipline
- **`claude -p` subprocess (`claude_llm.py`)** is for batch/pipeline work only — process spawn + CLI startup adds 5-15s of overhead on top of the actual API call. Free via Max plan.
- **Gemini direct API (`gemini_llm.py`)** is for user-facing interactive paths — follow-up generation, targeted quizzes, article question generation. ~2-5s latency. Use `response_mime_type='application/json'` for guaranteed valid JSON.
- **Rule of thumb**: If the user is waiting on a spinner, use Gemini direct API. If it's a cron job or batch pipeline, `claude -p` is fine.
- **Curriculum generation**: Still Opus only via `claude -p` — Gemini Flash curricula have meaningless titles.

### Code Conventions
- **Entity spans are offset-based on plain text.** `_compute_entity_spans()` in `review_engine.py` uses `text.find(name)`. Content must be markdown-stripped before span computation — use `_strip_markdown()`. Structured display uses `sections` JSON alongside flat `content`.
- Branch prefix: `sh/` for all GitHub branches
- No test plans or checklists in PR descriptions
- Component files under ~300 lines. Extract reusable UI into `app/components/`.
- **React Native Web links**: Use `MarkdownLink` component. Never `<Text onPress href>` (RNW blocks it).
- **KeyboardAvoidingView**: Required for bottom-sheet Modals with TextInput on iOS.
- **✦ Drawer**: Must be explicitly added to each tab screen (import `PetrarcaDrawer`).
- **No `as any`** — add proper types instead.
- **limbic.amygdala**: `pip install -e ~/src/limbic`. Server: `/opt/limbic`. Used for embeddings, similarity, clustering.
- **Standalone web pages**: HTML files in `scripts/` served via `_serve_html_file()` in research-server.py. Pattern: D3.js CDN, fetch from `/endpoint`, Petrarca design tokens. Examples: `curriculum_graph.html`, `curriculum_timeline.html`, `knowledge_atlas.html`.
- **DB is server-only**: `petrarca.db` lives at `/opt/petrarca/data/` on Hetzner. Local Python can't query it. Verify functions with `ast.parse()` for syntax, then `curl` the live endpoint after deploy.
- **Query server DB**: Write Python to `/tmp/script.py`, then `scp /tmp/script.py alif:/tmp/ && ssh alif "cd /opt/petrarca && python3 /tmp/script.py"`. Inline heredoc Python via SSH has quoting issues.

### Curriculum Generation
- Generate locally via `claude -p`, parse JSON, run through `curriculum.py` node builder

## User Preferences
- Prefers Claude Code agents (Max plan) over Anthropic API calls
- Rapid prototyping in small chunks, research depth before building
- Broad interests: history, classical philology, educational research, green party policy, AI
- Languages: Norwegian, Swedish, Danish, Italian, German, Spanish, French, Chinese, Indonesian, Esperanto, English

## Voice Processing
- **Soniox API**: Key in `/Users/stian/src/alignment/.env`, base: `https://api.soniox.com/v1`
- Patterns: `../alif/backend/app/services/soniox_service.py`

## Reference Projects
- **../alif**: Arabic learning app — Expo mobile, FSRS, `claude -p` wrapper
- **../otak**: Twitter bookmarks, Readwise, LLM providers (knowledge graph is a failed experiment)
- **../bookifier**: Pipeline/caching patterns
