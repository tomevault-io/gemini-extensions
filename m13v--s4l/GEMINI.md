> **Before ANY cross-site work (marketing a new product on multiple sites, adding a CTA, running an audit, generating content), open `~/social-autoposter/config.json` first.** It is the authoritative list of every website we run.

# Social Autoposter

## Source of truth for active projects: config.json

**Before ANY cross-site work (marketing a new product on multiple sites, adding a CTA, running an audit, generating content), open `~/social-autoposter/config.json` first.** It is the authoritative list of every website we run. Do not `ls ~/` looking for site repos, do not guess domains, do not hardcode a "list of our sites" anywhere.

Each entry under `projects[]` exposes (at minimum):
- `name` (e.g. `fazm`, `mediar`, `assrt`)
- `website` production domain
- `local_repo` path to the product repo (e.g. `~/fazm`)
- `landing_pages.repo` path to the website repo (e.g. `~/fazm-website`) <- use this for marketing pages, blog posts, CTAs
- `landing_pages.github_repo`, `landing_pages.base_url`, `landing_pages.gsc_property`
- `posthog.project_id`, `booking_link`, `get_started_link`, `qualification`

Rules:
- New website? Add it to `config.json` first; SEO pipeline, analytics checker, dashboard, and cross-site marketing scripts pick it up automatically.
- Never hardcode project names, repo paths, or domains outside `config.json`.
- Any script that iterates over "all our websites" MUST read `projects[]`.

## Shared UI library: @m13v/seo-components (~/seo-components)

**`~/seo-components` is where cross-site UI lives.** Published as `@m13v/seo-components`, consumed by every website in `config.json`. Before building a new component on one site (CTA block, newsletter signup, comparison table, FAQ, proof band), check if it already exists in the library, and if not, **add it to the library instead of building it site-local**. One site-local copy today becomes four divergent copies next quarter.

Already shipped (partial): `InlineCta`, `StickyBottomCta`, `BookCallCTA`, `GetStartedCTA`, `NewsletterSignup`, `FullSiteAnalytics`, `ComparisonTable`, `FaqSection`, `RelatedPostsGrid`, `ProofBand`, `GlowCard`, `ShimmerButton`, `BeforeAfter`, `AnimatedDemo`, `BentoGrid`, `Breadcrumbs`, `ArticleMeta`, `MetricsRow`, `TypingAnimation`.

Consumer sites import via the `@seo/components` alias. When adding a new component: build in `~/seo-components/src/components/`, bump version, then update each consumer (the `bump:consumers` script automates this).

## Dashboard colors: black and white only (per user instruction 2026-05-27)

**The dashboard at `bin/server.js` (and any HTML/CSS surface it renders) MUST use only black, white, and shades of gray.** No chromatic colors. No green for "good", no red for "bad", no purple/blue/amber/yellow accents on pills, badges, charts, or text.

Use `var(--text)` for foreground, `var(--muted)` for secondary, `var(--bg)` and `var(--card)` for backgrounds, and `var(--border)` for separators. The existing `pill(label, n)` helper at `bin/server.js` already enforces this shape (`color:var(--muted)` for the label, `color:var(--text)` for the number) and accepts a `_color` arg that is **deliberately ignored**; do not "fix" it to apply the color.

Forbidden in any new code on this dashboard:
- Hardcoded hex colors: `#22c55e` (green), `#ef4444` (red), `#a78bfa` (purple), `#eab308` (amber), `#3b82f6` (blue), etc.
- Tailwind palette classes: `text-green-*`, `bg-red-*`, `border-purple-*`, etc.
- Color-coded "good/bad" pills, status badges, or chart series.

If you need to convey severity, use weight (`font-weight:600`), brackets, parens, or a tooltip line, never color. Example: `age 77.1h (cap 1h, leak)` not `age <span style="color:red">77.1h</span>`.

Existing hardcoded chromatic colors elsewhere in `bin/server.js` are tech debt; do NOT proactively refactor them, but do NOT add new ones, and when you touch a line that has one, drop the color while you are there.

To audit when asked to "remove all colors": grep `bin/server.js` for `#[0-9a-fA-F]{3,8}` and `color:\s*(?!var\(|inherit|transparent|currentColor)` to find remaining chromatic usages.

## No retention pruning, ever (per user instruction 2026-05-08)

**Never delete `*_candidates` rows by age.** The user explicitly requires that every candidate row (`twitter_candidates`, `linkedin_candidates`, `reddit_candidates`, etc.) be kept forever, regardless of `status`. The full history (chosen, skipped, expired, posted) powers analytics on skip reasons, project routing, engagement curves, and growth dynamics; pruning destroys that signal.

Forbidden patterns anywhere in this repo (Python, shell, SQL, schedulers):

```sql
-- DO NOT REINTRODUCE
DELETE FROM <table>_candidates
 WHERE status IN ('posted', 'expired', 'skipped')
   AND discovered_at < NOW() - INTERVAL 'N days';
```

This was previously present in `scripts/score_twitter_candidates.py` (7-day prune, two call sites) and `scripts/score_linkedin_candidates.py` (`PRUNE_TERMINAL_AFTER_DAYS = 7` via `expire_and_prune()`); both were removed on 2026-05-08. Do not add a `PRUNE_TERMINAL_AFTER_DAYS` / `RETENTION_DAYS` constant or a "delete old" cleanup job back. No 30-day, 90-day, or any other retention window is acceptable. If the table grows enough to hurt query performance, add an index or a partitioned archive table; never delete rows.

What IS allowed: status flips (e.g. `UPDATE ... SET status='expired' WHERE status='pending' AND discovered_at < NOW() - INTERVAL 'N hours'`). Those are freshness gates that prevent stale candidates from burning judgment tokens; they do not lose data.

If a future agent (including the auto-commit agent) reintroduces a `DELETE ... FROM <table>_candidates` by-age, revert immediately and surface to the user.

## After any DB migration: realign sequences

After any `pg_dump`/`pg_restore` cutover (e.g. Neon -> Cloud SQL on 2026-05-21), run `python3 scripts/realign_sequences.py` once. Otherwise serial sequences lag behind restored row ids and every INSERT 500s with `duplicate key value violates unique constraint "*_pkey"` until natural collision-walk catches up.

## Testing /api/v1/* routes from this machine

Base URL is `https://s4l.ai` (NOT `app.s4l.ai`); auth header is `X-Installation: $(/usr/bin/python3 ~/social-autoposter/scripts/identity.py header)`. A `Bearer` token (real or fake) returns 401 `missing_token`, not a real test.

## Analytics wiring check

`scripts/check_analytics_wiring.py` audits every project in `config.json` for correct PostHog + `@m13v/seo-components` wiring. Catches silent-failure bugs where `window.posthog` is never set and helpers (NewsletterSignup, trackScheduleClick) no-op.

- Run on demand: `python3 scripts/check_analytics_wiring.py`
- Exits 1 on any BROKEN project; safe for pre-commit or CI.
- Preferred fix: mount `<FullSiteAnalytics>` from `@m13v/seo-components` (handles init + `window.posthog` + `<SeoAnalyticsProvider>`).

## Dashboard users + weekly reports: dashboard_users table (2026-05-14)

The `dashboard_users` Postgres table is the single source of truth for BOTH dashboard
access (Firebase custom claims) and weekly-report routing. Columns: `email`,
`firebase_uid`, `admin`, `projects[]` (config.json-cased names), `report_enabled`,
`name`. Do NOT put report recipients in config.json.

Onboard a new client (one email, N projects):
1. Add a row to `dashboard_users` (see `scripts/seed_dashboard_users.py` for the shape).
2. `node scripts/dashboard_provision.js create <email>` — creates the Firebase user,
   pushes the row's `admin`/`projects` into custom claims, writes `firebase_uid` back.
3. `python3 scripts/send_dashboard_invite.py <email>` — sends the app.s4l.ai magic-link
   invite (reads name/projects from the table).

Other `dashboard_provision.js` subcommands: `list` (DB<->Firebase diff), `sync` (reconcile
claims + UIDs for all rows), `magic <email>` (print a one-shot sign-in URL, does not send).

Weekly reports fan out from this table: `scripts/daily_stats_email.py` (social, legacy
filename) and `seo/daily_report.py` (SEO). Each recipient gets a project-scoped email;
admins (`projects` empty) get the unscoped master view. Quiet-week rule: a recipient with
zero posts (social) / zero pages (SEO) in the 7d window is skipped. Both support
`--sample`, `--dry-run`, `--only <email>`. Schedule: launchd `com.m13v.social-weekly-report`
+ `com.m13v.seo-weekly-report`, Monday 09:00.

## URL wrapping: short_links_live + canonical UTM scheme (2026-05-14, updated 2026-05-22)

**Never post bare URLs.** Every URL in any post text goes through `dm_short_links.wrap_text_for_post`, which always yields a `/r/<code>` short link (form 1) under normal operation; UTM-only (form 2) is now reserved for runtime failures of the mint API / pool only.

1. `https://<host>/r/<code>` (short link). `<host>` is resolved per-project in this order:
   - **Explicit** `short_links_host` from `config.json` (e.g. `"https://s4l.ai"`).
   - **Auto fallback** `https://s4l.ai` when `short_links_live: false` and no explicit host is set. This is the social-autoposter-owned resolver (`@m13v/seo-components` -> `app.s4l.ai/api/short-links/<code>`), used whenever the customer has not deployed `/r/[code]` on their own domain yet.
   - **Customer\'s own domain** (`project.website`) when `short_links_live` is unset/true.
2. `https://<host>?utm_source=s4l&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=<slug>&utm_term=<platform>&utm_content=post_<session>` (UTM URL). Now ONLY emitted on runtime failures of the mint pipeline (`pool_exhausted`, `api_unreachable`, `code_collision_after_8_tries`, `mint_api_error`). Never on policy.

**The 2026-05-22 change** (commit landing the same day): made `https://s4l.ai/r/<code>` the implicit default whenever `short_links_live: false`. Previously, `live=false` without an explicit `short_links_host` silently dropped to UTM-only and lost first-party `post_link_clicks` logging; that hole closed after the NightOwl regression on 2026-05-19. Onboarding a new customer where the resolver is not shipped yet now requires ONLY `short_links_live: false` in `config.json` (or no flag at all if you want the customer's own domain treated as live). The constants live at `scripts/dm_short_links.py::DEFAULT_FALLBACK_HOST` and `bin/server.js::SHORT_LINK_FALLBACK_HOST`; keep them in sync. Once a customer ships their own `@m13v/seo-components` `/r/[code]` resolver (or the static CSV from `mint_external_pool.py --export-csv`), flip `short_links_live` back to `true` (or remove the key) and remove any explicit `short_links_host` to route through their own domain.

The UTM scheme is **canonical and global**, not per-project. All four URL builders (`dm_short_links._build_target_url`, `_build_target_url_for_post`, `mint_external_pool._build_target`, `mint_kent_pool._build_target`) emit:

- `utm_source = "s4l"` (the agency). Customer-side analytics see "this traffic came from S4L" consistently.
- `utm_medium = "post"` (post rail) or `"dm"` (DM rail). Don't change; `bin/server.js` and `project_stats_json.py` parse `utm_content LIKE 'dm_%'` for booking attribution.
- `utm_campaign = <project_slug>` (runner, agora, podlog, nightowl, fazm, etc.).
- `utm_term = <platform>` (reddit, twitter, linkedin, github_issues). Platform was historically `utm_source`; moved here when `utm_source` became `s4l`.
- `utm_content = post_<minted_session>` (post rail), `dm_<dm_id>` (DM rail), or `<code>` (pool rail). Shape consumed downstream by `backfill_real_clicks.py`, `bin/server.js` regex `/^dm_(\d+)$/`, `project_stats_json.py`. Do not change.

Don't add per-project UTM templates to config.json. The scheme is fixed.

Caller exception branches must call `utm_only_text(text=..., platform=..., project_name=...)` from `dm_short_links` rather than posting unwrapped, so even if `wrap_text_for_post` itself raises, no bare URL escapes. Pattern lives in `post_reddit.py`, `engage_reddit.py`, `post_github.py`, `twitter_post_plan.py` (all four hardened 2026-05-14).

## Releasing: `bash scripts/release-mcpb.sh` only

ONE command releases npm + the GitHub `.mcpb` in lockstep from a `package.json` bump. Rules:
- **DEFAULT = STAGING (per user, 2026-07-04): `bash scripts/release-mcpb.sh --staging`.** Produces an `-rc.N` GitHub PRE-release that only staging-channel boxes pull; npm `latest` and `releases/latest` do NOT move. After testing, ship the exact tested artifact with `--promote <tag>` (no rebuild). Go straight to stable ONLY when the user explicitly says stable / promote / ship to everyone.
- **NEVER `--no-bump`/re-release an existing version.** npm versions are immutable, so it clobbers the `.mcpb` with new code while npm keeps the old → lanes diverge. A fix always gets a fresh patch bump.
- **Never** the old manual `npm publish` + `gh release create` flow.
- **Before releasing**, check repo `package.json` vs npm `latest` vs GitHub latest tag; if a version you didn't publish exists, a parallel agent released, so bump again.

## SKILL.md - Single File, No Copies

`SKILL.md` lives at the repo root. There is no `skill/SKILL.md`.

- `~/.claude/skills/social-autoposter` -> `~/social-autoposter/` (repo root)
- Claude loads `~/social-autoposter/SKILL.md` directly
- Shell scripts in `skill/` reference `$REPO_DIR/SKILL.md` (the root)
- `bin/cli.js` deletes any stale `skill/SKILL.md` during init/update
- `setup/SKILL.md` is a separate file (setup wizard, not the main skill)

### Rules

- **NEVER create `skill/SKILL.md`** - not as a file, not as a symlink
- **NEVER edit, modify, or write to `SKILL.md`** - it is locked with `chflags uchg` (macOS immutable flag). Do not attempt to unlock it. Do not run `chflags nouchg`. Do not run `chmod`. Just read it and follow the workflow exactly as written.
- **NEVER edit, modify, or write to `setup/SKILL.md`** - it is also locked with `chflags uchg`. Same rules as above: do not unlock, do not modify, do not "fix" it.
- **Do NOT add rate limits to ANY file** - do not add "Max N posts per 24 hours" or any posting rate limit language to SKILL.md, setup/SKILL.md, shell scripts, or any other file. There is NO posting rate limit. If a file does not contain a rate limit, that is intentional.
- **Do NOT "improve" or "fix" the workflow** - do not renumber steps, do not add safety checks, do not restructure the file.

## Locked pipeline files: NEVER unlock without explicit user instruction

Many pipeline scripts are locked with `chflags uchg` to prevent agents from "simplifying" or reverting data-driven improvements. An agent did exactly this on 2026-04-28: it ran `chflags nouchg`, stripped critical guardrails (two-lane grounding rule, Moltbook AUP context clearing), then relocked the files.

**NEVER run `chflags nouchg` on any file in this repo without the user explicitly saying "unlock X and change Y".** The lock is not a suggestion. It is a hard stop. If you think a locked file needs to change, stop and tell the user instead.

Locked files (do NOT unlock or edit without explicit user instruction):
- `scripts/engagement_styles.py` (grounding rule, tier weights, platform weights)
- `scripts/engage_reddit.py` (Moltbook context clearing, grounding rule in prompt)
- `skill/run-reddit-search.sh`, `skill/run-twitter-cycle.sh`, `skill/run-github.sh`, `skill/run-linkedin.sh`
- `scripts/top_performers.py`, `scripts/post_reddit.py`, `scripts/post_github.py`, `scripts/github_tools.py`
- `scripts/qualified_query_bank.py`, `scripts/top_search_topics.py` (Twitter Phase 1 query bank + per-topic ranking; both carry the 2026-05-29 cross-route guard: a query/topic is credited to a project ONLY when the resulting post's `posts.project_name` matched the issuing project. Removing the `p.project_name = a.project_name` / `_posted` guards re-opens the bug where a broad invented query for project A that the prep step re-routes to project B gets "qualified" for A on B's conversion.)
- `scripts/linkedin_api.py`, `scripts/discover_linkedin_candidates.py`, `scripts/score_linkedin_candidates.py`, `scripts/linkedin_browser.py`, `scripts/linkedin_url.py`, `scripts/log_linkedin_search_attempts.py`, `scripts/top_linkedin_queries.py`, `scripts/top_dud_linkedin_queries.py`
- `seo/generate_page.py`, `seo/escalate.py`, `seo/resume_escalations.py`
- `scripts/ingest_human_seo_replies.py`, `scripts/scan_dm_candidates.py`
- `skill/dm-outreach-reddit.sh`, `skill/dm-outreach-twitter.sh`, `skill/dm-outreach-linkedin.sh`
- `scripts/twitter_browser.py`, `scripts/scan_twitter_thread_followups.py`, `skill/scan-twitter-followups.sh`
- `scripts/scan_twitter_mentions_browser.py` (browser-based mention discovery, replaces deprecated API path)

- `scripts/reddit_chat_sync.py` (Reddit Chat IndexedDB reader, brittle external coupling)
- `scripts/reddit_tools.py` (Reddit search/fetch CLI; carries per-project sub-denylist merge from project_search_excludes — see Reddit project-scoped excludes section below)

- `scripts/strike_alert.py`, `skill/strike-alert.sh` (strike escalation rail; emails i@m13v.com on every newly-detected `status='deleted'` or `'removed'` post)
- `scripts/watchdog_hung_runs.py`, `skill/stats.sh`
- `skill/stats-linkedin.sh`, `scripts/scrape_linkedin_comment_stats.py`, `scripts/update_linkedin_stats_from_feed.py` (unified LinkedIn stats pipeline 2026-05-11: one scrape of `/in/me/recent-activity/comments/` via CDP-attach to the linkedin-agent MCP Chrome, single writer into `posts` table. Replaces the deprecated `scrape_linkedin_stats_browser.py` and the retired `stats-linkedin-comments.sh` + `update_linkedin_comment_stats_from_feed.py` pair. Do NOT re-introduce a per-permalink scrape, a second Chrome launch, or any Voyager-API path.)


## Reddit project-scoped excludes (Option C, 2026-05-11)

Self-improving per-project subreddit denylist for Reddit, mirroring the Twitter cycle's keyword-exclude pattern. Same DB table (`project_search_excludes`), same activation gate (≥2 distinct batches), same 60-day decay. The wiring lives in four files:

- `scripts/project_excludes.py` — adds typed-term forms (`subreddit:<slug>`, `keyword:<word>`) alongside the legacy twitter bare-keyword form. Platform gate (`ALLOWED_KINDS`) prevents cross-contamination: twitter can only write `bare`, reddit can only write `subreddit:` / `keyword:`. New helper `active_excludes_by_kind('reddit', project)` returns `{subreddit:[…], keyword:[…], bare:[…]}`. New CLI subcommand `active-split` exposes the same.
- `scripts/reddit_tools.py` — `_load_comment_blocked_subs(project_name=...)` reads (1) `config.json: subreddit_bans.comment_blocked` with optional `.project` field for per-project scoping, and (2) active `subreddit:` rows from `project_search_excludes`. Server-side enforcement at parse time in `cmd_search` and `cmd_fetch` via the `SAPS_REDDIT_PROJECT` env var. New `project_block_extra` counter on the `[reddit_search]` stderr marker shows how many of the blocked subs came from the per-project layer.
- `scripts/post_reddit.py` — draft prompt now accepts `action="reject"` JSON lines with a `proposed_excludes: ["subreddit:<slug>"]` array; `parse_reject_decisions()` + `_propose_excludes_from_rejects()` forward each into `project_excludes.propose('reddit', project, term, batch_id, ...)`. Discover phase logs `[project_excludes] platform=reddit project=… active_subs=N active_keywords=N subs=[…]` and calls `mark_used` to keep decay honest.
- `skill/run-reddit-search.sh` — documentation-only update; enforcement is fully Python.

Why subreddit-form, not keyword-form, as the primary lever: Reddit false positives are 90% structural-subreddit mismatches (`r/bestofredditorupdates` family drama matching on "alternative", `r/hfy` sci-fi matching on "spaced", `r/superstonk` meme stocks matching on stray words), not keyword collisions. Twitter is the inverse (brand-name collisions like `cricket`/`kohli` for Vipassana). Both forms are supported on both platforms via the schema but only the platform-natural form is wired into the prompts today.

Forbidden patterns (don't reintroduce):
- Bare-keyword `term` on reddit (e.g. writing `"anki"` as a reddit exclude). The platform gate rejects it (`rejected_invalid`); the post_reddit prompt instructs Claude to always emit typed form. A bare reddit term would have no callsite to read it back.
- Auto-proposing a top-performing sub for any project (e.g. `subreddit:medicalschool` for studyly). The prompt's "WRONG proposals" examples cover this, and `_load_reserved_terms_for_project` keeps the keyword side of the reserved list intact, but the **subreddit form bypasses keyword-reserved checks by design** — the sub name shares tokens with search topics legitimately. Trust the 2-batch activation gate to filter false rejects.

## LinkedIn stats pipeline architecture (2026-05-11)

LinkedIn stats follow the Twitter logic shape: ALL engagement (top-level posts AND engagement-comments) lives in the `posts` table, identified uniquely by `our_url`. There is no LinkedIn-specific replies table anymore. The 2026-05-11 migration moved the 257 legacy `replies` rows into `posts` and marked the originals `status='migrated'`; the dashboard feed query already filters `WHERE r.status='replied'` so migrated rows naturally drop out of the replies surface and re-appear under the `posts` surface as `posted_comment` events.

URL convention for LinkedIn `posts.our_url`:
- Top-level post: `https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:{share|activity|ugcPost}:<post_id>/`
- Engagement-comment on someone else's post: `.../urn:li:{ns}:<parent_id>/?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28<ns>%3A<parent_id>%2C<our_comment_id>%29`

The `?commentUrn=...` suffix is what makes the post-stats updater able to read OUR comment's stats from the activity feed instead of leaking the parent post's reactions / comments. `linkedin_api.py:comment_on_post` was patched on 2026-05-11 to embed it (mirroring what `reply_to_comment` already did). Posts written before that patch (~1,022 rows where `our_url == thread_url`) cannot be backfilled without per-permalink scraping (banned), so their stats stay frozen at the parent-post leak until LinkedIn naturally re-surfaces them on the activity tab.

### Migration day cleanup (2026-05-11)

- Migrated 257 LinkedIn rows from `replies` to `posts` (225 inserts + 32 dedup-skipped); originals flagged `status='migrated'`.
- Deleted ONE true duplicate: `posts.id=5081` (placeholder "comment on MCP post") was the same logical comment as `posts.id=24872` (which has the real content). Re-pointed `replies.id=5288.post_id` from 5081 to 24872 before deletion so the FK stayed valid.
- 4 placeholder-content rows (`5512` "comment on DR growth post", `5513` "comment on Overseer post", `5514` "comment on AI building post", `5515` "comment on Sora shutdown post") were NOT deleted; they are the only record of those engagement-comments and their dashboard-paired 24xxx rows differ by `replyUrn` (so they are follow-up sub-replies, not duplicates).
- 6 "duplicate-looking" pairs (5459/24895, 5484/24894, 6808/24956, 6809/24957, 6810/24958, 6811/24959) are actually distinct comments in the same thread: the 5xxx row holds the original comment and the 24xxx row carries a `&replyUrn=` for a follow-up sub-reply. NOT duplicates; both kept.
- 2 same-URL-different-content pairs (24952/24953, 24960/24965) are a remaining data-quality anomaly worth a future look but not blocking; both rows have real content.

## Known unresolved issue: hung runs from BSD grep on /tmp FIFOs

A `run-*.sh` can occasionally hang indefinitely because the model invokes `grep -r` across `/tmp` (or `~/`) during a session. macOS BSD `grep` opens named pipes it encounters (e.g. stale `ad_mailbox_*` FIFOs left by Apple daemons) and blocks forever in `read()`, which freezes the shell, the `claude -p` parent, and prevents launchd from re-firing the job. No automatic recovery is in place: wrapping `claude` in `timeout` was rejected, and neither FIFO sweeps nor switching to GNU grep fully eliminates the class of problem. For now, if a posting run stops making progress, kill the stuck `run-*.sh` tree manually.


## LinkedIn: flagged patterns (DO NOT REINTRODUCE)

2026-04-17 the account was restricted after a patch added Voyager-API scraping and per-permalink scroll-and-expand loops. Volume (2-3 posts/day) was NOT the cause, behavioral fingerprinting of scripted browser activity was. Banned in this repo:

- `/voyager/api/*` calls of any kind (Python, `fetch()`, `page.evaluate`). That is the internal web-client backend, not the public API.
- Loops that open each post permalink to scrape reactions/comments, or combine `scrollBy` with clicks on "Show more comments" / "Load earlier replies".
- Python Playwright/CDP helpers that drive *posting, replying, scrolling, multi-page navigation, or programmatic `login()` flows*. The 17 Apr restriction was caused by behavioral fingerprinting of those patterns, not by Python existing in the call stack.

Allowed: `scripts/linkedin_api.py` (OAuth `api.linkedin.com/v2/socialActions/*`, documented) for posting, and `mcp__linkedin-agent__*` (real headed Chrome) for any browser work, driven by Claude inside the shell pipelines. Session checks are passive: if login/checkpoint appears, print `SESSION_INVALID` and stop.

**Carve-out (2026-04-29): read-only sidebar pre-checks via Python Playwright are allowed under strict conditions.** `scripts/linkedin_browser.py` may attach to the linkedin-agent's persistent profile (`~/.claude/browser-profiles/linkedin`) in **headed** mode for cost-saving "is anything unread?" gates ahead of the Claude-driven engage-dm-replies pipeline. Allowed inside this helper:

- ONE `page.goto('/messaging/')` per invocation.
- ONE `page.evaluate()` to read sidebar conversation rows + unread badges from the DOM.
- Headed Chromium only (`headless=False`). Headless fingerprints differently.
- Inherit the same persistent profile so cookies/session/fingerprint match the MCP agent.

Banned inside this helper, no exceptions:

- `/voyager/api/*` (still). The pre-check reads only DOM that the user themselves would see.
- Multi-page loops, permalink scrapes, scroll-and-expand on threads, "Show more" clicks.
- Any clicks, types, or form interactions. Read-only.
- Programmatic login. If `_is_login_or_checkpoint(url)` matches, return `session_invalid` and stop.

New LinkedIn capability that *acts* (posts, replies, edits, scrolls multiple pages)? Extend `linkedin_api.py` or add a Claude-driven `mcp__linkedin-agent__` step. Do not write a new Python CDP *action* helper.

## Engagement Styles System (DO NOT REMOVE)

All posting and engagement scripts use `scripts/engagement_styles.py` to generate a `STYLES_BLOCK` variable injected into prompts. This is an A/B testing system that tracks which comment style gets the best engagement.

- **NEVER remove `STYLES_BLOCK`** from any `skill/run-*.sh` or `skill/engage*.sh` script
- **NEVER remove `engagement_style`** from DB logging (reply_db.py calls, INSERT statements)
- **NEVER remove or simplify style definitions** in `scripts/engagement_styles.py`
- **NEVER inline style definitions** back into individual scripts; the shared module is the single source of truth
