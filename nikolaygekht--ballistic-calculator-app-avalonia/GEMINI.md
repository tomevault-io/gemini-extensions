# BallisticCalculator2 - Project Guide for Claude

## Project Goal

A cross-platform ballistic calculator built on **Avalonia UI**. It began as a rewrite of an older
WinForms application; that application is archived and is **not** a reference for this work any more.

## Development Workflow

**Trunk-based development.** Commit directly to `main`; do **not** create feature branches unless explicitly requested. Only commit/push when asked.

## Key References

### Libraries
- **Gehtsoft.Measurements**: Measurement units library located at `/mnt/d/develop/components/BusinessSpecificComponents/Gehtsoft.Measurements/Gehtsoft.Measurements/`
  - Provides generic `Measurement<T>` struct where T is a unit enum (DistanceUnit, VelocityUnit, WeightUnit, etc.)
  - Static method: `Measurement<T>.GetUnitNames()` returns `Tuple<T, string>[]` for populating unit lists

- **BallisticCalculator** (NuGet **1.1.13**; the `PackageReference`s pin exact versions, they are not ranges):
  Core ballistic calculation library.
  Source at `/mnt/d/develop/components/BusinessSpecificComponents/BallisticCalculator.Net/`.
  - Provides `BallisticCoefficient` struct, `DragTableId` enum, and the calculation engine.
  - **`.drg` metadata (1.1.11.2):** the header carries name, weight, diameter, **bullet length** and
    **source**; `DrgDragTable.Save`/`Open` round-trip all of them, and
    `RadarDragTableFactory.Create` takes optional `bulletLength`/`source`. Files written earlier store
    those two slots as `0` — treat non-positive as absent.
  - **Multi-BC scale (1.1.11.3):** `DrgDragTableFactory.Build` now returns the projectile's own Cd
    (`Cd_base(M)/BC(M) * SD`), the same scale a `.drg` stores, so a built table survives Save/Open and runs
    with the **form factor of 1** the factory stamps into the entry. Bullet **weight and diameter are
    required** (they set the scale) and the supplied BC is overwritten. Before this, a built table needed a
    BC *value* of 1.0 and was 1/SD (≈2.8×) too draggy once saved.
  - **Zeroing API (1.1.11):** `SightAngle` was removed — compute the zero with
    `TrajectoryCalculator.CalculateZeroParameters(...)` then `ShotParameters.Apply(zero)`. `ShotParameters`
    also has `ShotDropAdjustment`/`ShotWindageAdjustment` (dialed clicks), `BarrelAzimuth`, `Latitude`.
  - **`BallisticCalculator.Tools`** namespace: `PointBlankRange`, `MovingTargetLead`, `HitProbability`,
    `RadarDragTableFactory`, `BallisticCoefficientConverter` (see the `ballistic-calculator` skill).
  - **Atmosphere (1.1.12):** `Density` is now computed from the resolved station `Pressure` rather than the
    constructor's `pressure` argument — it was up to 21% high at 5000 ft with `pressureAtSeaLevel: true`. **No
    trajectory, zero or drag result changes** (the engine always read the resolved pressure); only the public
    property. `CreateICAOAtmosphere` no longer feeds `humidity` into the base-altitude slot (~0.008% of
    pressure, and only for calls that passed a humidity). New `Atmosphere.DensityAltitude` — the
    standard-atmosphere altitude matching this air's density; note its baseline is the ICAO sea-level density,
    **not** `Atmosphere.StandardDensity` (they differ ~0.005%, about 1.9 ft, and are not interchangeable).
  - **Named failures (1.1.13):** the engine now raises its own exception types instead of a bare
    `InvalidOperationException`, so the UI can tell a bad input from a bug:
    `ZeroRangeCantBeReachedException` (the load cannot reach the zero distance) and
    `TrajectoryCannotBeCalculatedException` (the numbers do not integrate — a zero BC, weight or muzzle
    velocity). Both derive from `InvalidOperationException`, so catch them **before** any broader handler.
    Mapped to user-facing sentences in `ShotCalculator.Explain`; everything else keeps its stack trace.
  - **`MilDotReticle`** is built in **milliradians** (12 mrad across, zero at 6 mrad, marks on whole mrad) —
    note `AngularUnit.Mil` is the military mil, 1/6400 of a circle, and ~1.9 % off a milliradian.
  - Consult the `ballistic-calculator` skill before using this API; it describes the **1.1.13+** surface,
    including both named exceptions and `MilDotReticle` in milliradians.

### Core domain helpers (`Common/BallisticCalculator.Types/`)

- **`ShotTrajectoryCalculator`** — the ONLY place that turns a `ShotData` into a trajectory. `Calculate`
  (display, uses configured step/max) and `CalculateFine` (2.5 m step, ≥3000 m). Table/chart use the
  coarse trajectory; reticle + summary share one fine trajectory. Add new consumers here, don't
  re-implement the calc.
- **`ZeroingData`** owns all zeroing inputs (distance, zero ammo/atmosphere, V/H offsets, wind, shot
  angle); `ZeroingCalculator.BuildInputs` converts it to the library `Rifle`/`ZeroingParameters`.

## Development Approach

### 1. Separate Desktop and Mobile Applications

**Philosophy**: Don't compromise desktop capabilities for mobile compatibility.

- **Desktop applications** should use all available desktop UI capabilities:
  - Complex layouts and multi-window support
  - Keyboard shortcuts and mouse interactions
  - High information density
  - Advanced controls (e.g., data grids, complex input controls)

- **Mobile applications** will be separate projects:
  - Touch-optimized interfaces
  - Simplified workflows
  - Larger touch targets
  - Different navigation patterns

#### What's Shared vs Platform-Specific

**Shared across ALL platforms** (in `Common/`):
- **Business logic types**: `Ammunition`, `Atmosphere`, `Rifle`, `Wind`, `ShotParameters`, `TrajectoryPoint`, etc.
- **Pure logic controllers**: `MeasurementSystemController`, `ChartController`, etc.
- **Service interfaces**: `IFileDialogService` and similar abstractions
- **Data models**: `AmmunitionLibraryEntry`, `ChartTrajectory`, etc.

**Platform-specific** (Desktop panels are NOT reused for mobile):
- **Input Panels**: `AmmoPanel`, `AtmospherePanel`, `RiflePanel`, etc. are desktop-only
- **Complex Controls**: `TrajectoryTableControl`, `TrajectoryChartControl` are desktop-optimized
- **Layouts**: Desktop uses dense layouts with labels beside controls; mobile needs stacked/vertical layouts

**Why panels are platform-specific**:
- Desktop panels are optimized for mouse/keyboard with dense information display
- Mobile needs completely different UI: larger touch targets, screen-by-screen navigation, stacked layouts
- Trying to make one panel work for both results in compromised UX on both platforms
- Mobile apps will create their own UI that uses the shared business logic types directly

**For future mobile development**:
- Create `Mobile/` projects with platform-native UI
- Import shared types from `Common/BallisticCalculator.Types/`
- Reuse controllers and service interfaces
- Build mobile-optimized views from scratch (not adapted desktop panels)

### 2. KISS - Keep It Simple, Stupid

**Key Principle**: Don't over-engineer. Create only what we actually need.

#### What We Learned About Controls

After struggling with Avalonia's reactive property system causing circular notification loops, we adopted a simpler approach:

**❌ AVOID: Reactive/MVVM Patterns (for our use case)**
- We don't need reactive properties that auto-update from background data changes
- Our app is **action-driven**: everything happens by explicit user interaction
- Reactive frameworks add complexity we don't need

**✅ USE: Direct UI Access Pattern**
```csharp
// Value property reads directly from UI on-demand (no stored state)
public object? Value
{
    get
    {
        // Always read from UI controls
        return _controller.Value(NumericPart?.Text ?? "", unit, DecimalPoints, Culture);
    }
    set
    {
        // Write directly to UI controls
        NumericPart.Text = text;
        SelectUnit(unit);
    }
}

// Events just notify - don't update properties
NumericPart.TextChanged += (s, e) => Changed?.Invoke(this, EventArgs.Empty);
```

**Benefits**:
- No circular notification loops
- No recursion guards needed
- Simple, predictable behavior
- Easy to debug

#### Control Design Principles

1. **No validation in controls** - Validate at application level where you have full context
2. **Min/Max for UI only** - Use Minimum/Maximum properties only for increment/decrement behavior, NOT for rejecting user input
3. **Precision transparency** - Store original values to preserve precision when display rounds (e.g., 0.45678 displays as 0.457 but returns exact value if unchanged)
4. **Direct UI access** - Value getters read from UI controls directly, no intermediate storage
5. **Simple events** - Controls raise `Changed` events, application decides what to do

#### Value Formatting: Two Paths

MeasurementControl has two distinct formatting paths depending on how data enters the control:

**Programmatic set (`SetValue<T>`)** — loading saved data, setting from library:
- Uses `ParseValuePreservePrecision` in the controller
- Preserves the value's own meaningful precision (up to 5 decimal digits)
- Does NOT pad with trailing zeros: 40gr → "40", not "40.00"
- Does NOT truncate higher precision: 0.308in on a 2dp control → "0.308", not "0.31"
- Does NOT convert to the panel's current measurement system unit — shows original unit as-is

**User-driven set (`Value` property / `ChangeUnit`)** — unit conversion, user typing:
- Uses `ParseValue` in the controller
- Strictly applies `DecimalPoints` — formats to exactly the configured precision
- Prevents floating-point noise from accumulating through convert round-trips (e.g., gr→g→gr stays clean)

**Why two paths**: Without this separation, switching metric↔imperial repeatedly would accumulate floating-point noise (168gr → 10.886g → 168.000005gr). Loaded data should never lose precision, but converted data must be clamped to prevent noise.

#### When NOT to Create Abstractions

- **Don't create interfaces** unless you have multiple implementations
- **Don't create ViewModels** unless you need testable presentation logic separate from views
- **Don't use data binding** for simple value display/entry (direct property access is simpler)
- **Don't use dependency injection** unless you need different implementations at runtime

### 3. Controller Pattern (for complex controls)

For controls with complex logic, separate pure logic from UI:

**Controller** (Controllers/MeasurementController.cs):
- Pure C# logic
- No Avalonia dependencies
- Easy to unit test
- Methods like `Value()`, `ParseValue()`, `IncrementValue()`, `AllowKeyInEditor()`

**Control** (Controls/MeasurementControl.axaml.cs):
- Thin UI layer
- Calls controller methods via reflection (for generic types)
- Direct UI manipulation

### 4. Avoid Avalonia Pitfalls We Encountered

**Issue**: Circular notification loops when using StyledProperty with TwoWay binding
```csharp
// ❌ This caused endless loops:
private void RaiseChanged()
{
    var newValue = GetValueInternal();
    SetCurrentValue(ValueProperty, newValue);  // Triggers SelectionChanged → RaiseChanged → infinite loop
    Changed?.Invoke(this, EventArgs.Empty);
}
```

**Solution**: Don't update property values in event handlers, just notify
```csharp
// ✅ Simple and works:
NumericPart.TextChanged += (s, e) => Changed?.Invoke(this, EventArgs.Empty);
```

**Issue**: Generic controls aren't supported in XAML
```csharp
// ❌ Can't do this:
public class MeasurementControl<T> : UserControl where T : Enum
```

**Solution**: Use non-generic control with Type property + reflection
```csharp
// ✅ Works:
public class MeasurementControl : UserControl
{
    public Type? UnitType { get; set; }  // Set to typeof(DistanceUnit)
    // Use reflection to create MeasurementController<T>
}
```

## Development Guidelines

### For New Features

1. **Start simple** - Implement the minimal working version first
2. **Write tests first (TDD)** - Unit tests are your primary verification tool
3. **Avoid premature abstraction** - Don't create interfaces/patterns until you need them
4. **Follow the existing panels and controls** - When in doubt, copy the pattern of the closest
   existing control, panel or dialog in this repository

### For Controls

1. **UI in XAML** - Keep XAML simple (layout only, no complex bindings)
2. **Logic in Controller** - Complex logic goes in controller classes
3. **No validation** - Controls accept any parseable input
4. **Events over properties** - Raise Changed events, let application handle updates

### Spacing and Layout (Desktop)

**Goal**: Keep a dense, desktop-grade information layout. Avalonia controls carry a lot of built-in padding, so we use tighter spacing values to compensate.

- **StackPanel Spacing**: Use `Spacing="4"` for form field rows (labels + controls)
- **Section padding**: Use `Padding="5"` on Border sections, not 10
- **Section headers**: Use `Margin="0,0,0,2"` below header TextBlocks, not 5
- **No extra margins** on button rows within form layouts — let StackPanel spacing handle gaps
- **Horizontal button bars** (OK/Cancel): Keep `Spacing="10"` — buttons need more breathing room than form rows
- **Separator controls**: Use as-is between logical groups (they add their own minimal spacing)

### For Testing (TDD Approach)

**We use Test-Driven Development** - This is a core principle of the project.

1. **Write tests FIRST** - Tests define expected behavior before implementation
2. **Do the heavy lifting in unit tests** - Comprehensive test coverage catches bugs early
3. **xUnit + Avalonia Headless** - For automated UI tests
4. **Test actual behavior** - Don't test implementation details
5. **Use DebugApp for exploratory testing** - After tests pass, verify visually
6. **Test on real data** - Use realistic values from ballistics domain

**Why TDD matters here:**
- One reason we rejected the reactive approach was that it made tests almost useless
- With reactive properties, we had to debug everything manually despite having tests
- Our simplified direct-UI-access pattern makes tests reliable and meaningful
- When tests pass, the code actually works (unlike with reactive complexity)

## Common Patterns

### Creating a New Control

1. Create controller in `Controllers/` (pure logic, no UI)
2. Create control in `Controls/` (XAML + code-behind)
3. Wire up controller in control constructor
4. Add test page to DebugApp
5. Test manually, then add automated tests

### Using Measurement Library

```csharp
// Create measurement
var distance = new Measurement<DistanceUnit>(100, DistanceUnit.Meter);

// Get unit names for dropdown
var unitNames = Measurement<DistanceUnit>.GetUnitNames();
// Returns Tuple<DistanceUnit, string>[] like (DistanceUnit.Meter, "m")

// Convert units
var feet = distance.To(DistanceUnit.Foot);
```

### Reading/Writing Control Values

```csharp
// Generic controls
var value = control.GetValue<DistanceUnit>();
control.SetValue(new Measurement<DistanceUnit>(100, DistanceUnit.Meter));

// BallisticCoefficient control
var bc = control.Value;
control.Value = new BallisticCoefficient(0.450, DragTableId.G1);
```

## What to Avoid

1. **Over-engineering** - Don't build frameworks, build features
2. **Reactive complexity** - Our app doesn't need background data updates
3. **Deep inheritance** - Prefer composition over inheritance
4. **Premature optimization** - Make it work, then make it fast if needed
5. **Complex data binding** - Direct property access is often simpler

## Questions to Ask

Before adding complexity, ask:
- Do we actually need this abstraction?
- Will this feature be used in multiple places?
- Is there a simpler way?
- Does an existing control, panel or controller in this repository already solve this?

## Summary

**Core Philosophy**: Build a functional, maintainable application using the simplest approach that works. Avoid framework complexity that doesn't serve our action-driven, desktop-focused use case. When uncertain, follow the patterns already established in this repository.
