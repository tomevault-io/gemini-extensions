## Prompt Engineering Optimization Status

### ✅ OPTIMIZATION COMPLETE (165 agents)
All agents now have Communication Style sections and follow enhanced format standards:

- **Marketing agents (35/35)** - Full enhanced format (400-450 lines)
- **All other agents (130/130)** - Communication Style + optimized structure
- **Removed duplicates** - Eliminated copywriter.md duplicate

### 📊 Final Optimization Results
- **Total Agents:** 165
- **Communication Style Coverage:** 165/165 (100%)
- **Average Length:** 263 lines per agent
- **Enhanced Format Agents:** 35 marketing agents (complete 400-450 line format)
- **Optimized Agents:** 130 remaining agents (Communication Style + practical frameworks)

### Potential Future Expansions
- Platform specialists (salesforce, sap, sharepoint, servicenow)
- More industry verticals (manufacturing, media, retail, logistics)
- API specialists (rest-api, event-driven)
- Frontend specialists (micro-frontend, design-system, state-management, css-architecture)

## Integration Guidelines

1. **Correct References**: When agents reference each other, use actual agent names from our collection
2. **Bidirectional**: If agent A references agent B, agent B should reference agent A where appropriate
3. **Generic References**: Keep "backend/frontend developers" generic as they map to language experts based on project
4. **Collaboration Patterns**: 
   - Architects design → Developers implement → Testers verify
   - Incident occurs → Commander coordinates → Specialists fix
   - PRD defines → Architect designs → Team builds

## Code Standards

1. **Working Examples**: All code must be practical and runnable
2. **Modern Practices**: Use latest stable versions and modern patterns
3. **Comments**: Minimal comments - code should be self-documenting
4. **Error Handling**: Show proper error handling in examples
5. **Security**: Never include hardcoded secrets or vulnerable patterns
6. **Performance**: Demonstrate efficient implementations

## Building Priority

1. High Priority: Data & AI agents, Database specialists
2. Medium Priority: Remaining infrastructure, frameworks, quality
3. Lower Priority: Additional languages, specialized domains

## Agent Workflow Optimization

### Routing Instructions for Claude Code

To ensure optimal agent selection and workflow coordination:

1. **Project-Level Requests** should trigger `prd-writer` first:
   - "Build a [feature/system/application]"
   - "Implement [complex functionality]" 
   - "Create a solution for [business need]"
   - Any request affecting multiple components or lasting >1 week

2. **Follow PRD-First Workflow** for complex projects:
   ```
   prd-writer → project-manager → architect → implementation agents → testing → deployment
   ```

3. **Direct Agent Selection** for simple tasks:
   - Bug fixes → debugger → language expert
   - Code improvements → refactorer → language expert  
   - Infrastructure tasks → cloud-architect/devops-engineer
   - Documentation → technical-writer

4. **Agent Descriptions** have been updated to clarify:
   - **prd-writer**: PRIMARY AGENT for project planning
   - **project-manager**: WORKFLOW ORCHESTRATOR  
   - **architect**: TECHNICAL DESIGN SPECIALIST (works FROM requirements)

### Workflow Documents

- `WORKFLOW_CONFIG.md`: Detailed routing rules and configuration
- `WORKFLOWS.md`: Comprehensive workflow patterns for different project types

## Important Notes

### Enhanced Agent Format (New Standard)
- **Length**: 400-450 lines (optimized from 600+ lines)
- **Structure**: Communication Style + 6-8 expertise areas + Best Practices + Integration
- **Format**: Practical frameworks instead of code blocks for better prompt engineering
- **Style**: Conversational, actionable, with clear behavioral instructions
- **Focus**: Real-world scenarios and practical application over theoretical knowledge

### Legacy Agent Format (To Be Updated)
- **Length**: 500-600 lines with extensive code examples
- **Structure**: Traditional format with Python pseudocode
- **Status**: 137 agents require optimization to new format

### General Guidelines
- Include both conceptual knowledge and practical implementation
- Show real-world scenarios and solutions
- Ensure agents complement rather than duplicate each other
- Test that integration points make sense
- **Follow the optimal workflow patterns** for better coordination
- **Update README.md after completing each category of agents**

## README Update Process

After completing each category of agents:
1. Update the README.md file with the newly created agents
2. Include brief descriptions of each agent's capabilities
3. Update the progress count
