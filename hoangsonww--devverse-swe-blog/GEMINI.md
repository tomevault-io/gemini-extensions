# DevVerse SWE Blog - GitHub Copilot Instructions

DevVerse SWE Blog is a modern tech blog built with Next.js, React, TypeScript, MDX, Supabase, and TailwindCSS. It serves as a platform for sharing software engineering insights and technical tutorials.

**CRITICAL: Always reference these instructions first and fallback to search or bash commands only when you encounter unexpected information that does not match the info here.**

## Working Effectively

### Bootstrap and Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install  # Takes ~30-40 seconds, NEVER CANCEL
```

**ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES REQUIRED:**
```bash
# Create .env file or set environment variables for development
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://example.supabase.co  # Use stub for development
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=example_key             # Use stub for development
```

**CRITICAL: Without these environment variables, the application will crash with "supabaseUrl is required" error.**

### Development Server
```bash
# Start development server with environment variables
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://example.supabase.co NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=example_key npm run dev
# OR set environment variables first, then run:
npm run dev  # Server starts on http://localhost:3000
```
- Takes ~1-2 seconds to start
- **ALWAYS** set environment variables before running dev server
- App crashes without proper Supabase environment variables

### Testing and Validation
```bash
# Run tests - NEVER CANCEL
npm run test  # Takes 1-2 seconds, all 11 tests should pass

# Run tests with coverage
npm run coverage  # Takes 1-2 seconds, generates coverage reports

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch
```

### Linting and Formatting
```bash
# Format code (this is also the lint command)
npm run lint      # Runs prettier, takes ~1-2 seconds
npm run format    # Same as lint, runs prettier --write
```
**ALWAYS run `npm run format` before committing changes - the CI pipeline will fail without proper formatting.**

### Build Process
**⚠️ CRITICAL BUILD LIMITATION:**
```bash
npm run build  # FAILS in sandboxed environments due to Google Fonts access
```
**NEVER CANCEL the build command - it will timeout due to network restrictions trying to fetch fonts from fonts.googleapis.com. This is expected in sandboxed environments.**

The build failure is due to:
- `next/font/google` imports in `app/layout.tsx` and `components/TableOfContents.tsx`
- Network restrictions preventing access to Google Fonts API
- This does NOT affect development server functionality

## Manual Validation Requirements

### Essential Validation Steps
After making changes, **ALWAYS** run through these validation scenarios:

1. **Start Development Server:**
   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://example.supabase.co NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=example_key npm run dev
   ```

2. **Navigate to http://localhost:3000 and verify:**
   - Homepage loads with article list
   - Search functionality works
   - Topic filtering works
   - At least one article can be clicked and loads properly

3. **Test Article Navigation:**
   - Click on any article from the homepage
   - Verify article content loads with proper formatting
   - Verify code blocks display correctly
   - Verify table of contents appears and works (desktop)
   - Verify breadcrumb navigation works

4. **Run Tests:**
   ```bash
   npm run test && npm run coverage
   ```

5. **Format Code:**
   ```bash
   npm run format
   ```

```

### Important Files to Monitor
- **`supabase/supabaseClient.ts`**: Supabase client configuration - requires environment variables
- **`app/layout.tsx`**: Root layout with Google Fonts imports - causes build issues
- **`components/TableOfContents.tsx`**: Contains Google Fonts imports - causes build issues
- **`package.json`**: Contains all available scripts and dependencies
- **`.github/workflows/ci.yml`**: CI pipeline with build, test, and deployment steps

## Common Tasks and Commands

### Available npm Scripts
```bash
npm run dev        # Start development server
npm run build      # Build for production (FAILS in sandboxed env)
npm run start      # Start production server
npm run test       # Run Jest tests
npm run test:watch # Run tests in watch mode
npm run coverage   # Run tests with coverage report
npm run lint       # Format code with Prettier
npm run format     # Same as lint
```

### Docker Support
```bash
# Build and run with Docker
docker-compose up  # Builds and starts container on port 3000

# Manual Docker build
docker build -t devverse-blog .
docker run -p 3000:3000 devverse-blog
```

### CI/CD Pipeline Information
The `.github/workflows/ci.yml` pipeline includes:
1. **Format & Lint** - Prettier and ESLint checks
2. **Tests** - Jest test suite
3. **Coverage** - Test coverage generation  
4. **Docker Build** - Container image build
5. **Deploy** - Vercel deployment

**Timeout Settings for CI:**
- Format & Lint: 5 minutes (default)
- Tests: 10 minutes (default) 
- Coverage: 15 minutes (default)
- Docker Build: 30 minutes (default)

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Application Won't Start
- **Error**: "supabaseUrl is required"
- **Solution**: Set environment variables before running dev server:
  ```bash
  NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://example.supabase.co NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=example_key npm run dev
  ```

### Build Failures
- **Error**: Font fetch failures from fonts.googleapis.com
- **Expected**: This is normal in sandboxed environments with network restrictions
- **Workaround**: Development server works fine; only production build is affected

### Test Failures
- **Expected Result**: All 11 tests should pass in 1-2 seconds
- **Coverage**: Should achieve ~93% statement coverage
- **Action**: Investigate if test failures are related to your changes

### Formatting Issues
- **Error**: CI pipeline fails on formatting
- **Solution**: Always run `npm run format` before committing
- **Note**: The lint command runs Prettier, not ESLint

## Network and Environment Limitations

### External Dependencies That May Fail
1. **Google Fonts** (fonts.googleapis.com) - Build time only
2. **Google Analytics** (googletagmanager.com) - Runtime only
3. **KaTeX CSS** (cdn.jsdelivr.net) - Runtime only
4. **Vercel Analytics** - Runtime only

### Working Around Network Restrictions
- Development server works with stub environment variables
- All core functionality is available locally
- External font/analytics failures don't break core features
- Use screenshots to validate UI changes since external resources may be blocked

## Key Validation Commands Reference

```bash
# Quick validation sequence (run after changes):
npm install
npm run test
npm run format
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://example.supabase.co NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=example_key npm run dev
# Then manually test in browser

# Full validation sequence:
npm install
npm run test
npm run coverage
npm run format
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://example.supabase.co NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=example_key npm run dev
# Then perform manual testing scenarios
```

**Remember: Always validate that your changes work end-to-end by running the application and testing user workflows, not just running build commands.**
