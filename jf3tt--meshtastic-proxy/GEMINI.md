# Meshtastic Proxy — Agent Instructions

## Project Overview

A TCP proxy for Meshtastic LoRa mesh radio nodes, written in Go. It connects to a single Meshtastic node over TCP, accepts multiple client connections (iOS/Android Meshtastic app, Python CLI, etc.), and multiplexes traffic between them. Includes a web dashboard, mDNS service advertisement, and Kubernetes deployment manifests.

## Architecture

```
Meshtastic Node (TCP :4403)
        │
   node.Connection          ← persistent TCP, auto-reconnect, config caching
        │
   proxy.Proxy              ← accept clients, broadcast FromRadio, relay ToRadio
   ├── proxy.Client[0]      ← per-client read/write loops + send channel
   ├── proxy.Client[1]
   └── ...
        │
   Other components:
   ├── discovery.Advertiser  ← mDNS (_meshtastic._tcp), multi-interface support
   ├── web.Server            ← HTTP dashboard + SSE + metrics API
   ├── telegram.Bot          ← LoRa → Telegram bridge (optional, via pub/sub)
   └── metrics.Metrics       ← counters, ring buffers, pub/sub for SSE
```

### Key Dependencies

- `buf.build/gen/go/meshtastic/protobufs` — Meshtastic protobuf definitions (FromRadio, ToRadio, MeshPacket)
- `github.com/hashicorp/mdns` — mDNS server (one `*mdns.Server` per network interface)
- `github.com/BurntSushi/toml` — config parsing
- `google.golang.org/protobuf` — protobuf runtime

## Wire Protocol

Meshtastic TCP uses a 4-byte frame header: `[0x94] [0xC3] [len_hi] [len_lo]` followed by a protobuf payload (max 512 bytes). See `internal/protocol/frame.go`.

- Node → Proxy: `FromRadio` protobuf (config, packets, telemetry, etc.)
- Proxy → Node: `ToRadio` protobuf (packets, want_config_id, etc.)
- Proxy → Client: same `FromRadio` frames (broadcast + cached config replay)
- Client → Proxy: same `ToRadio` frames (forwarded to node)

## Important Design Decisions

### Cached Config Replay

The proxy caches the full node configuration (MyInfo, Config, ModuleConfig, Channel, NodeInfo, ConfigCompleteId — up to 172+ frames) when it first connects to the node. Config is delivered to clients **on demand**: the proxy waits for the client to send `want_config_id` (which all standard Meshtastic clients do after TCP connect), then replies from cache via `replayCachedConfig`.

**Client connection flow in `proxy.handleNewConnection`:**
```
client = NewClient(conn, ...)   ← onMessage callback intercepts want_config_id & disconnect
registerClient(client)
client.Run(ctx)                 ← starts read/write loops; client sends want_config_id
                                ← onMessage intercepts it → replayCachedConfig(client, nonce)
```

`replayCachedConfig` delivers frames through `client.Send()` (the channel-based write loop). It substitutes the `ConfigCompleteId` nonce with the client's nonce so the client accepts the config sequence. The send channel buffer (256) is large enough for 172 frames because the write loop is actively draining it.

#### iOS Two-Phase Config (Special Nonces)

The iOS Meshtastic app uses two sequential `want_config_id` requests with special nonces defined in firmware (`PhoneAPI.h`):

| Nonce | Constant | Requests |
|---|---|---|
| `69420` | `SPECIAL_NONCE_ONLY_CONFIG` | Config only (MyInfo, Metadata, Channels, Config, ModuleConfig, own NodeInfo) — skips other nodes' NodeInfo |
| `69421` | `SPECIAL_NONCE_ONLY_NODES` | NodeInfo DB only (all NodeInfo frames) — skips config |

`filterConfigCache()` in `proxy.go` classifies cached frames and returns only the appropriate subset. For any other nonce (e.g. Python CLI with a random nonce), all frames are returned unfiltered.

#### iOS CoreData Timing Workaround (ownNodeInfoDelay)

When replaying cached config for nonce `69420` (config-only phase), the proxy inserts a 50ms pause **after sending the connected node's own NodeInfo frame**. This is a workaround for a timing issue in the iOS Meshtastic app:

1. iOS creates `NodeInfoEntity` in a CoreData **background context** when it receives the NodeInfo frame
2. The SwiftUI views read from the **view context**, which merges changes asynchronously via `automaticallyMergesChangesFromParent`
3. When the proxy delivers all cached frames instantly (no network latency like BLE), `ConfigCompleteId` arrives before the view context has merged the new `NodeInfoEntity`
4. The app transitions to `.subscribed` state, SwiftUI re-renders, queries `getNodeInfo(id:context:)` on the view context — and gets `nil`
5. `connectedNode == nil` causes the entire "Actions" section (including Trace Route) to disappear

The 50ms delay gives the iOS main RunLoop time to process the CoreData merge notification before `ConfigCompleteId` triggers the UI refresh. This delay only applies to the iOS config-only phase (nonce `69420`) and only after the own NodeInfo frame — it does not affect nodes-only phase (`69421`) or full config replay (random nonce from Python CLI).

See `ownNodeInfoDelay` constant and the delay logic in `replayCachedConfig()` in `internal/proxy/proxy.go`.

### ToRadio Interception

The proxy intercepts two `ToRadio` frame types from clients, preventing them from reaching the node:

| Frame | Action | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| `want_config_id` | Reply from cache via `replayCachedConfig` | Prevents node config re-request that would corrupt cache and blast config to all clients |
| `disconnect` | Close client locally via `client.Close()` | Prevents client disconnect from tearing down the shared node connection |

All other `ToRadio` frames are forwarded to the node as-is.

### mDNS Multi-Interface

`discovery.Advertiser` creates a separate `*mdns.Server` per configured network interface. The `hashicorp/mdns` library only supports one `*net.Interface` per server. When `interfaces` config is empty, a single server with system-default interface is used.

### mDNS Hostname (.local Domain)

The mDNS SRV/A records **must** use a hostname in the `.local` domain (RFC 6762). iOS `NWBrowser` will not resolve hostnames outside `.local`. The `mdnsHostname()` function in `internal/discovery/advertiser.go` ensures this:

1. If `mdns.hostname` is set in config, use it (`.local.` appended automatically if missing).
2. If empty, fall back to `os.Hostname()` with `.local.` appended.

Without this, the hostname defaults to the bare OS hostname (e.g. `talos-worker-01.`) which iOS cannot resolve via mDNS, causing auto-discovery to silently fail.

### hostNetwork in Kubernetes

mDNS multicast cannot traverse Kubernetes overlay networks. The deployment uses `hostNetwork: true` and the namespace has `pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce: privileged` because the `baseline` Pod Security Standard blocks hostNetwork.

## Development

### Build & Test

```bash
make build          # build binary to ./bin/
make test           # go test -v -race ./...
make lint           # go vet + golangci-lint
make run            # build + run with config.toml
make docker         # docker compose build
make docker-up      # docker compose up -d
```

### Running Tests

Always use the race detector:

```bash
go test -race -v ./...
```

All tests must pass with `-race`. The project has zero tolerance for data races.

### Git Hooks

Pre-commit hook runs `go vet`, `go test -race`, and lint. Install with:

```bash
make install-hooks
```

### Config File

- Development: `config.toml` (git-tracked, real node address)
- Example/reference: `config.example.toml` (safe defaults)
- Kubernetes: `deploy/kubernetes/configmap.yaml`
- Docker: mounted at `/app/config.toml`
- Kubernetes: mounted at `/etc/meshtastic-proxy/config.toml`

## Deployment

### Docker

Image: `ghcr.io/jf3tt/meshtastic-proxy:latest`

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### Kubernetes

Target environment: Talos OS, Cilium CNI, MetalLB. Worker node `talos-worker-01` with LAN interface `enx00155dc6c81d` (USB-Ethernet, IP `10.10.0.31/24`).

```bash
kubectl apply -f deploy/kubernetes/namespace.yaml
kubectl apply -f deploy/kubernetes/configmap.yaml
kubectl apply -f deploy/kubernetes/deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f deploy/kubernetes/service.yaml
```

Manifests use `imagePullPolicy: Always` and image tag `latest`.

#### Kubernetes Manifest Summary

| File | Resource | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `namespace.yaml` | Namespace `meshtastic` | Privileged PSS for hostNetwork |
| `configmap.yaml` | ConfigMap | TOML config with LAN interface |
| `deployment.yaml` | Deployment | Pod with hostNetwork, HTTP probes on web port |
| `service.yaml` | Service (LoadBalancer) | Exposes web dashboard (8090) via MetalLB |

#### Probes

Health probes use `httpGet` on the **web** port (8090), NOT `tcpSocket` on the proxy port (4404). Using tcpSocket on 4404 creates fake Meshtastic client connections that instantly disconnect, spamming the logs.

## Code Style & Conventions

- Go 1.24+, standard library preferred over third-party when possible
- `log/slog` for structured logging (no `log` or `fmt.Printf` for runtime logging)
- `sync.Mutex` / `sync.RWMutex` for shared state, `sync/atomic` for counters
- Non-blocking sends to channels with `select` + `default` (drop or disconnect on full)
- `context.Context` for cancellation propagation throughout all goroutines
- Errors wrapped with `fmt.Errorf("doing X: %w", err)` for context
- Test files colocated with source (`*_test.go` in same package)

## Known Pitfalls

1. **net.Pipe in tests**: `net.Pipe` is synchronous — `Write` blocks until `Read` consumes. Use TCP loopback (`net.Listen` + `net.Dial` on `127.0.0.1:0`) for tests where the write side must not block.

2. **hashicorp/mdns data races**: The `mdns.Query()` client has internal races after sending entries to a channel. Tests that use `mdns.Query` must synchronize with `sync.WaitGroup`, not rely on channel close timing.

3. **Meshtastic node config size**: The config cache can be 170+ frames. Any code path that delivers these frames must not be bounded by a fixed-size channel.

4. **Talos OS interface names**: The worker node uses `enx00155dc6c81d` (USB-Ethernet, MAC-based naming), not `eth0`. Cilium creates many `cilium_*` and `lxc*` interfaces — the mDNS `interfaces` config must explicitly list the LAN interface to avoid advertising on CNI interfaces.
