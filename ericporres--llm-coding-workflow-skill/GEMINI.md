# LLM Coding Workflow

AI-augmented software engineering workflow that maximizes LLM effectiveness through structured planning, clear context, strategic delegation, and human accountability.

## What This Skill Does

This skill synthesizes Addy Osmani's LLM coding workflow, Anthropic's agentic coding research, Harper Reed's spec-driven pipeline, and patterns from 30+ real-world projects. It supports two collaboration modes — interactive pair programming and autonomous delegation — and provides a systematic approach to AI-assisted development that prevents wasted cycles while enabling increasingly autonomous execution.

**Core Philosophy**: The human engineer is the accountable owner; the AI is a capable collaborator whose autonomy scales with the quality of the prompt. Well-scoped delegation with clear acceptance criteria is not "blind trust" — it is a higher-leverage operating mode.

**Two Collaboration Modes:**

| Mode | When | How | Review |
|------|------|-----|--------|
| **Pair Mode** (Conductor) | Ambiguous problems, design decisions, learning new domains | Interactive back-and-forth; AI as thought partner | Line-by-line as you go |
| **Delegation Mode** (Orchestrator) | Well-scoped tasks with clear acceptance criteria | Structured prompt → autonomous execution → human review | Deliverable review against spec |

**Key Capabilities:**
- **Structured Planning**: Rapid waterfall-style planning before implementation
- **Chunked Execution**: Small, focused tasks with quick course correction
- **Context Management**: Systematic context provision for optimal AI output
- **Model Selection**: Strategic switching between models based on task needs
- **Human Accountability**: You own the output; review depth scales with delegation scope
- **Delegation Prompts**: Spec-driven handoff for autonomous execution
- **Granular Commits**: Frequent save points for easy rollback
- **Continuous Learning**: Skill amplification through AI collaboration

## Complete Guide

### The 10 Principles

This workflow is built on 10 core principles that maximize AI effectiveness:

#### 0. Interview Before Planning

**Before you plan, make sure you're planning the right thing.** Most people show up with a solution in their head ("build me a dashboard") when the real need is something different ("I need three numbers emailed to me every Monday"). This one prompt closes the gap:

> *"I'm about to start this project. Interview me until you have 95% confidence about what I actually want, not what I think I should want."*

This flips the dynamic. Instead of you pitching an idea and hoping the AI reads your mind, the AI asks the questions that surface assumptions you did not know you were making. It separates the _what_ from the _why_ before a single line of planning gets done.

**How to use it:**
- Start every new project or feature with this prompt (or something like it)
- Answer honestly, including "I don't know yet" — the gaps are where the value is
- Let the AI play it back: "So what you actually need is ___. Is that right?"
- Only after confirmation should you move to Principle 1 (planning)

This is especially valuable in **Delegation Mode** — if the spec is wrong, everything downstream is wrong. Five minutes of interviewing saves five hours of rework.

#### 1. Plan Before Coding

**Never start implementation without a plan.** Use AI to rapidly create detailed specifications.

```
You: I need to implement [feature]. Help me create a detailed spec including:
- Functional requirements
- Edge cases
- Technical constraints
- Preferred patterns
- Success criteria
```

**Workflow:**
```bash
# Create comprehensive plan
/llm-workflow plan "[feature description]"

# Output includes:
# - Requirements breakdown
# - Task decomposition
# - Risk assessment
# - Testing strategy
```

This is "waterfall in 15 minutes" - rapid structured planning that prevents wasted cycles.

#### 2. Break Work Into Small Chunks

**Never request monolithic outputs.** Feed the LLM focused, manageable tasks one at a time.

**Bad:**
```
Write a complete authentication system with login, logout,
password reset, 2FA, session management, and user profiles.
```

**Good:**
```
Task 1: Create the login endpoint with basic validation
Task 2: Add password hashing utility
Task 3: Implement session token generation
...
```

```bash
# Auto-decompose large tasks
/llm-workflow decompose "Build authentication system"

# Execute one chunk at a time
/llm-workflow next-chunk
```

Each iteration carries forward context from completed work.

#### 3. Provide Extensive Context

**LLMs are only as good as the context you provide.** Supply all relevant information:

- Codebase sections (related files, patterns)
- API documentation
- Technical constraints
- Preferred approaches
- Examples of good solutions
- Warnings about problematic approaches

```bash
# Pack context for a task
/llm-workflow context-pack \
  --files "src/auth/**/*.ts" \
  --docs "docs/api.md" \
  --patterns "prefer-composition-over-inheritance"

# Include in prompt
/llm-workflow implement --with-context
```

**Context Loading Commands:**
```
/context add [file|directory|glob]
/context add-doc [url|file]
/context add-constraint "[constraint]"
/context add-pattern "[pattern-name]"
/context show
/context clear
```

#### 4. Choose the Right Model Strategically

Practice "model musical chairs" - different models have different strengths:

| Model | Strengths | Use For |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| Claude | Reasoning, nuance, long context | Architecture, complex logic |
| GPT-4 | Broad knowledge, tool use | Integration, APIs |
| Gemini | Multimodal, speed | Quick iterations, docs |

```bash
# Set preferred model for task type
/llm-workflow config set model.architecture "claude"
/llm-workflow config set model.quickfix "gemini"
/llm-workflow config set model.integration "gpt4"

# Auto-select based on task
/llm-workflow implement --auto-model

# Switch when stuck
/llm-workflow switch-model
```

**Tip:** Use the newest pro-tier versions for quality results. Switch models when one gets stuck.

#### 5. Leverage AI Agents Across Development Lifecycle

Modern AI coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot Workspace) can read files, run tests, fix bugs, open PRs, and execute multi-step tasks autonomously. The question is not whether to delegate, but how much supervision to apply.

**Pair Mode — Interactive agent use:**
```bash
# Short, focused agent tasks with immediate review
/llm-workflow agent-task "Fix all TypeScript errors in src/"
/llm-workflow agent-task "Update tests for changed files"
/llm-workflow agent-review  # review before moving on
```

**Delegation Mode — Autonomous agent execution:**
```bash
# Well-scoped delegation with clear acceptance criteria
# (See "Delegation Mode" section below for full prompt template)
/llm-workflow delegate "Implement user auth API" --spec spec.md
/llm-workflow delegate-status   # check progress
/llm-workflow delegate-review   # review deliverable against spec
```

**Guardrails scale with scope, not with distrust:**

| Delegation Scope | Guardrails |
|-----------------|------------|
| Single file fix | Commit diff review |
| Feature implementation | Spec review + test pass + code review |
| Multi-service change | Spec review + integration tests + manual QA |
| Infrastructure/security | Never fully delegate; pair mode only |

#### 6. Maintain Human Accountability

**You own the output.** Review depth should scale with delegation scope, not default to maximum suspicion.

**Pair Mode review** — You reviewed as you went. A quick diff and test pass suffices:
```bash
/llm-workflow test --affected
/llm-workflow commit
```

**Delegation Mode review** — You delegated a scoped task. Review the deliverable against the spec:
```bash
# Review deliverable against acceptance criteria
/llm-workflow delegate-review --spec spec.md

# Run full test suite
/llm-workflow test --full

# Security review for sensitive areas
/llm-workflow review --security
```

**Review Checklist (adapt to scope):**
- [ ] Deliverable matches spec / acceptance criteria
- [ ] Tests pass (unit + integration as appropriate)
- [ ] No security regressions
- [ ] No unintended side effects outside scope
- [ ] Code style consistent with project conventions

**The operating model is "delegate, review, own"** — not "distrust and micromanage." A well-scoped prompt with clear acceptance criteria earns a deliverable-level review, not a line-by-line audit.

#### 7. Use Frequent, Granular Git Commits

Treat commits as **save points in a game**. Commit after each small task completes successfully.

```bash
# After each successful chunk
/llm-workflow commit --auto-message

# With verification
/llm-workflow commit --verify-tests

# Quick save point
/llm-workflow checkpoint "Implemented login validation"
```

**Benefits:**
- Easy rollback if AI suggestions introduce bugs
- Clear documentation of development progression
- Safe experimentation with AI suggestions

#### 8. Customize AI Behavior

Create rules files to guide AI outputs toward team idioms and patterns.

**CLAUDE.md / GEMINI.md / .cursorrules:**
```markdown
# Project Conventions

## Code Style
- Use functional components with hooks (React)
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Maximum function length: 50 lines
- Always include error boundaries

## Patterns
- Repository pattern for data access
- Service layer for business logic
- DTOs for API responses

## Avoid
- Any usage of `any` type
- Nested ternaries
- Magic numbers without constants

## Testing
- Unit tests for all business logic
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Minimum 80% coverage
```

```bash
# Initialize rules file
/llm-workflow init-rules

# Add convention
/llm-workflow add-rule "Always use async/await over .then()"

# Validate against rules
/llm-workflow validate-rules
```

#### 9. Embrace Strong Testing and Automation

Robust CI/CD pipelines **enhance AI productivity**. Automated feedback loops help refine outputs.

```bash
# Setup automation integration
/llm-workflow setup-ci

# Run full quality pipeline
/llm-workflow quality-check

# This runs:
# - Linters
# - Type checkers
# - Unit tests
# - Integration tests
# - Security scans
```

**Pipeline Feedback:**
```bash
# Feed CI results back to AI for fixes
/llm-workflow fix-ci-errors

# Auto-iterate until passing
/llm-workflow iterate-until-green --max-attempts 3
```

#### 10. Continuous Learning

Using AI doesn't dull skills - it **amplifies existing expertise**. LLMs reward best practices.

```bash
# Review AI code to learn
/llm-workflow explain-code

# Debug AI mistakes
/llm-workflow analyze-error

# Track learning moments
/llm-workflow log-learning "[insight]"
```

**Learning Practices:**
- Review every piece of AI-generated code
- Understand why AI made specific choices
- Debug AI mistakes yourself first
- Keep notes on effective prompts

### Delegation Mode: Spec-Driven Autonomous Execution

When a task is well-scoped with clear acceptance criteria, delegation mode lets you hand off implementation to an AI agent and review the deliverable rather than supervising each step.

#### Pre-Delegation Checklist

Before delegating, verify:
- [ ] Task has a clear, bounded scope (one feature, one fix, one refactor)
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are explicit and testable
- [ ] The codebase has existing tests or a test framework in place
- [ ] No security-sensitive changes (auth, payments, PII handling) — those stay in pair mode
- [ ] You can verify the deliverable against the spec without reading every line

#### Delegation Prompt Template

```markdown
## Task
[One-sentence description of what to build/fix/refactor]

## Context
- Project: [repo name, relevant paths]
- Stack: [language, framework, key libraries]
- Related files: [list specific files the agent should read]

## Acceptance Criteria
1. [Specific, testable criterion]
2. [Specific, testable criterion]
3. [Specific, testable criterion]

## Constraints
- Follow existing patterns in [file/directory]
- Do not modify [protected areas]
- All tests must pass before marking complete

## Out of Scope
- [Explicitly list what NOT to do]
```

#### Three-Tier Execution Model

For complex projects, delegation can span multiple tiers:

| Tier | Tool | Role | Example |
|------|------|------|---------|
| **Design** | Cowork / Chat | Architecture, spec writing, review | "Design the auth system" |
| **Build** | Claude Code | Autonomous implementation | "Implement the auth API per spec.md" |
| **Scale** | Ruflo / Swarms | Parallel multi-agent execution | "Run 4 agents: API, tests, docs, migration" |

The spec is the handoff document between tiers. Write it in tier 1, execute it in tier 2, scale it in tier 3.

#### Recovery from Delegation Failures

When a delegated task goes off-track:
1. **Stop** — don't let it compound. `git stash` or `git reset` to last checkpoint.
2. **Diagnose** — was the spec ambiguous? Was context missing? Was the task too broad?
3. **Adjust** — tighten the spec, add missing context, break into smaller delegations.
4. **Re-delegate or switch to pair mode** depending on diagnosis.

### Best Practices

#### Session Practices
1. **Always plan first** - 15 minutes of planning saves hours of rework
2. **Small chunks** - If it feels big, break it down more
3. **Context is king** - More relevant context = better output
4. **Switch models** - Don't get stuck; try a different model
5. **Review everything** - You're the accountable engineer
6. **Commit often** - Every passing test is a save point

#### Anti-Patterns to Avoid
1. **Monolithic requests** - "Build me the entire feature"
2. **Blind trust** - Accepting AI code without review
3. **Context starvation** - Not providing enough information
4. **Model loyalty** - Sticking with one model when stuck
5. **Big commits** - Waiting until everything is done
6. **Skipping tests** - "It looks right" is not verification

#### When to Switch Models

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| AI gives repetitive wrong answers | Switch model |
| Complex reasoning needed | Try Claude |
| Need speed for iterations | Try Gemini |
| API/integration task | Try GPT-4 |
| Getting stuck | Always try switching |

---

### Troubleshooting

#### AI Producing Poor Output
1. Check context completeness
2. Verify clear task description
3. Try switching models
4. Break task into smaller chunks
5. Add more examples/patterns

#### Tests Failing After AI Changes
1. Use `/rollback` to restore
2. Review the failing change
3. Ask AI to explain its approach
4. Implement manually with AI guidance
5. Commit more granularly next time

#### Context Too Large
1. Focus on most relevant files
2. Summarize documentation
3. Use pattern references instead of examples
4. Split into multiple sessions

#### Model Not Following Conventions
1. Check rules file is loaded
2. Explicitly state conventions in prompt
3. Provide examples of correct style
4. Add constraints to context

---

### Integration with Tools

#### Context Packaging
- **gitingest** - Bundle repo for LLM ingestion
- **repo2txt** - Convert repo to text
- **Context7** - Advanced context management

#### Code Review
- **Chrome DevTools MCP** - Debugging and quality loops
- Built-in `/review` commands

#### Testing
- Integrates with Jest, pytest, Mocha, etc.
- Auto-generates tests with `/test --generate`
- Coverage tracking with `/test --coverage`

---

### Environment Variables

```bash
export LLM_WORKFLOW_MODEL="claude"
export LLM_WORKFLOW_CHUNK_SIZE="small"
export LLM_WORKFLOW_AUTO_COMMIT="true"
export LLM_WORKFLOW_HUMAN_REVIEW="required"
export LLM_WORKFLOW_TEST_FRAMEWORK="jest"
```

---

### Summary

The LLM Coding Workflow treats AI as a capable collaborator whose autonomy scales with prompt quality. Success comes from:

1. **Plan** — Rapid structured planning before coding
2. **Chunk** — Small, focused tasks (pair mode) or well-scoped delegations (delegation mode)
3. **Context** — Extensive relevant information; context injection beats model upgrades
4. **Select** — Right model for the task
5. **Delegate or Pair** — Match the collaboration mode to the task
6. **Own** — Review depth scales with scope; you own the output regardless
7. **Commit** — Granular save points for easy rollback
8. **Learn** — Continuous skill amplification through AI collaboration

**The operating model is "delegate, review, own."** AI coding agents are force multipliers — and increasingly, autonomous executors of well-scoped work. The human engineer sets direction, writes specs, reviews deliverables, and takes accountability.
