# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What This Repo Is

A Claude Code **plugin** that helps security engineers develop Cortex XSIAM/XSOAR content. The plugin bundles skills (content generation workflows) and reference knowledge files. There is no runtime code — no build step, no tests, no package manager.

## Plugin Architecture

The plugin is installed via `claude plugin` and exposes skills to Claude Code. Skills are Markdown files with YAML front-matter (`SKILL.md`) that Claude reads to guide content generation. Each skill reads its own reference files before generating output.

## How Skills Work

Each `SKILL.md` follows this pattern:
1. YAML front-matter with `name` and `description` (used for skill matching)
2. A "Before Starting" section listing which reference files to read first
3. A step-by-step workflow the model follows
4. A validation checklist before delivering output

Skills never generate code outside of YAML/JSON output files. All XSIAM content is delivered as unified `.yml` files (Python embedded inside YAML via `script: |-` for scripts, `script.script: |-` for integrations and event collectors), except correlation rules which are delivered as `.json` files matching the XSIAM export/import format.

The xsiam-xql, xsiam-correlations, xsiam-splunk-to-xql, and xsiam-widgets skills use **tiered reference loading**. Core XQL references always load; specialized references (advanced functions, extended datasets, federated search) load on-demand based on query requirements. This reduces token cost for simple queries while keeping advanced knowledge available.

## Scripts vs Integrations vs Event Collectors

The key structural differences between the three Python skill types:

| | xsiam-scripts | xsiam-integrations | xsiam-event-collectors |
|---|---|---|---|
| Use when | Standalone data processing | Connecting to external APIs | Ingesting events into data lake |
| Python location in YAML | Top-level `script: |-` | Nested `script.script: |-` | Nested `script.script: |-` |
| Base class | None (direct demisto calls) | `BaseClient` subclass | `BaseClient` subclass |
| YAML fetch flag | N/A | `isfetch: true` | `isfetchevents: true` |
| Data output | `return_results()` | `demisto.incidents()` (fetch) | `send_events_to_xsiam()` |
| Data destination | War room / context | Incident queue | XSIAM data lake (XQL queryable) |
| Naming convention | Any | PascalCase | Must end with `EventCollector` |

## XQL Skill Family

Four skills share a common XQL reference layer under `xsiam-shared/references/`:

| Skill | Purpose | Output |
|---|---|---|
| xsiam-xql | Standalone queries (hunting, investigation, analytics) | XQL in code block with header comments |
| xsiam-correlations | Detection rules (correlation rule engineering) | Complete `.json` with embedded XQL |
| xsiam-splunk-to-xql | SPL translation (Splunk migration) | XQL in code block with "Translated from SPL" note |
| xsiam-widgets | Dashboard widget visualization queries | XQL with `| view graph` in code block with header comments |

## Key XSIAM Conventions to Preserve

- **YAML field order for scripts** matters — must match real XSIAM export order: `commonfields → vcShouldKeepItemLegacyProdMachine → name → script → type → tags → comment → enabled → args → outputs → scripttarget → subtype → timeout (optional) → pswd → runonce → dockerimage → runas → engineinfo → mainengineinfo`
- **YAML field order for integrations** matters — must match real XSIAM export order: `commonfields → vcShouldKeepItemLegacyProdMachine → name → display → category → description → sectionorder → configuration → script`
- **`vcShouldKeepItemLegacyProdMachine: false`** — always present after `commonfields` in both scripts and integrations
- **`sectionorder`** — lowercase 'o' (not camelCase `sectionOrder`), simple list format matching real XSIAM exports
- **`supportedModules: []`** — must be the first field on every `configuration` parameter, every `commands` entry, and every `arguments` entry in integration/event-collector YAML. For scripts, every `args` entry must have it as its first key.
- **Never include** `fromversion`, `marketplaces`, `tests` — content-pack CI fields only. (`timeout` IS a real, importable script field — optional Go duration string like `30m0s`, placed between `subtype` and `pswd`.)
- **Always include** `register_module_line()` calls as the first and last lines of embedded Python — required for platform line-number tracking
- Docker image: always pinned `3.12.x` (e.g., `demisto/python3:3.12.12.6947692`), never `:latest`
- `demisto.alert()` for XSIAM; `demisto.incident()` is XSOAR equivalent
- Arg defaults use `defaultValue:` (not `default:`); list args include `isArray: true`
- Config params should include `additionalinfo:` tooltips and `section:` for tab assignment

## When Editing Skills or References

- Skills reference their own reference files with relative paths (e.g., `references/script-yaml-spec.md`, `../xsiam-shared/references/common-patterns.md`)
- The `xsiam-shared/references/` directory contains both shared Python patterns (`common-patterns.md`, used by scripts and integrations) and shared XQL references (`xql-core-reference.md`, `xql-datasets-core.md`, etc., used by xsiam-xql, xsiam-correlations, xsiam-splunk-to-xql, and xsiam-widgets) — changes to shared files affect all consuming skills
- `marketplace.json` lists the skills exposed by the plugin; add new skills there when creating a new skill directory
- Design documents for significant changes go in `docs/plans/` with filename format `YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name-design.md` (must end in `-design.md` — `.gitignore` only tracks files in `docs/plans/` matching that suffix)

## Publishing

Install locally for testing:
```bash
claude plugin install xsiam-buddy@xsiam-buddy
```

Publish to marketplace:
```bash
claude plugin marketplace add joseph3325/xsiam-buddy
```

Version is tracked in both `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` — update both when bumping.
