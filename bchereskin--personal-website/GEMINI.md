## Blog System
- Blog posts are stored in **Supabase** (`blog_posts` table), NOT in local files
- `app/blog/posts.ts` contains query functions (`getPublishedPosts`, `getPostBySlug`, etc.) that fetch from Supabase
- `BlogPost` interface: `id`, `slug`, `title`, `excerpt`, `date`, `readTime`, `category`, `content`, `is_published`, `visit_count`
- Content uses a custom markdown-like format parsed by `BlogRenderer.tsx`:
  - `## Heading` / `### Heading` for headers
  - `**bold**` for bold text
  - `- item` for bullet points
  - `[MODEL]` blocks for special model comparison cards
- To add a new post: use the admin dashboard (`/admin`) or insert directly into Supabase
- Posts support comments (threaded, stored in Supabase `comments` table)
- Visit tracking via `increment_blog_post_visits` RPC

## Supabase Database (project: opnsoprahgrfwjiwyvnn)
- `blog_posts` — blog content (title, slug, content, category, published status, visit count)
- `comments` — threaded reader comments on blog posts
- `contacts` — contact form submissions
- `subscribers` — newsletter email signups
- `shared_pages` — hosted HTML pages (admin-managed content platform)
- All tables have RLS enabled

## Styling Conventions
- CSS custom properties for all colors (`--primary`, `--accent`, `--neutral-*`, etc.)
- Use Tailwind arbitrary values like `bg-[var(--background)]` to reference CSS vars
- CSS vars remap legacy `--neutral-*`/`--primary` aliases onto the Field Notes palette (see top of `globals.css`)
- Prefer server components; use `'use client'` only where interactivity requires it (forms, dashboard, comments)

## Image Handling
- Local images in `/public` — use Next.js `<Image>` component
- Remote images from Unsplash are allowed via `next.config.ts`

## Security
- All user input is sanitized via `app/lib/sanitize.ts` (`escapeHtml`, `sanitizeInput`)
- HTML entities escaped in all email templates (Resend)
- CSP + security headers configured in `next.config.ts`
- Admin routes protected by `ADMIN_EMAIL` allowlist in middleware + API routes
- Supabase RLS enabled on all tables
- Rate limiting on public API routes (`app/lib/rate-limit.ts`)

## SEO
- JSON-LD structured data: `Person` + `WebSite` in root layout, `Article` on each blog post
- RSS feed at `/feed.xml`, sitemap at `/sitemap.xml`, robots at `/robots.txt`
- Per-post OpenGraph + Twitter metadata via `generateMetadata`
- Dynamic OG images for shared pages

## Preferences
- Keep code simple and avoid over-engineering
- Don't add unnecessary comments or docstrings
- Light theme only — the dark theme was fully removed in the April 2026 redesign

## Roadmap

### Quick Wins (1-2 days each)
- [ ] **/now page** — What Brett is focused on right now, updated monthly. Gives repeat visitors a reason to return.
- [ ] **/uses page** — Tool stack (AI tools, productivity, hardware). Great for SEO and audience alignment.
- [ ] **Related posts / "Read Next"** — Show 2-3 related posts at bottom of each blog post (match on `category`).
- [ ] **Social share buttons** — LinkedIn, X, copy link on each blog post. Remove friction from sharing.
- [ ] **Company logo bar** — Visual logos for West Point, dub, Affirm, Army on home page. Trust signal.
- [ ] **Active navigation state** — Highlight current page in nav bar.
- [ ] **Reading list / bookshelf** — Curated books + one-sentence annotations. Could be section on /now or standalone.

### Medium Projects (3-7 days each)
- [ ] **Newsletter strategy upgrade** — Name the newsletter, pitch what subscribers get, place CTAs in 3 spots (end of posts, footer, dedicated page). Consider Buttondown for delivery/analytics.
- [ ] **Case studies / proof of work** — 2-3 narrative case studies (Problem → Approach → Result with metrics). Essential for advisory credibility.
- [ ] **Testimonials / endorsements section** — 2-4 short quotes from colleagues or founders Brett has advised.
- [ ] **Blog post table of contents** — Auto-generate from `##` headings. Improves readability + creates anchor links.
- [ ] **Reading progress bar** — Thin progress bar at top of blog posts showing scroll progress.
- [ ] **Building in public changelog** — Running log of what Brett builds on the site, with dates.

### Larger Projects (1-2 weeks+)
- [ ] **Newsletter platform migration** — Move from custom `/api/subscribe` to Buttondown or beehiiv for delivery, analytics, compliance.
- [ ] **AI "Ask Brett" chatbot** — Chatbot trained on blog posts. On-brand differentiator for AI-focused personal brand.
- [ ] **Speaking / events page** — Page for speaking engagements, panels, workshops. Creates inbound signal.

### Strategic (Ongoing, no code)
- [ ] **Sharpen niche positioning** — Lean into "the operator who builds with AI" specifically. Update hero tagline + meta descriptions.
- [ ] **LinkedIn cross-pollination** — Adapt every blog post into a LinkedIn post linking back to full piece.
- [ ] **Consistent author identity** — Same headshot, name format, bio across LinkedIn, X, website, guest posts.
