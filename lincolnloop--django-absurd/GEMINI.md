How to WRITE tests here. For how to RUN them (suite invocations, compose services, the
pre-commit gates), see [`../CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md).

- pytest, **function-based only** (never class-based).
- **Non-fixture test helpers live in a `utils.py`** module (never `support.py` or other
  invented names) — e.g. `tests/utils.py`, `tests/core/test_admin/utils.py`,
  `tests/pg_cron/utils.py`. Import the module (`from tests import utils`) and qualify.
- **Same for the fixture task modules**: `from tests import tasks` /
  `from tests import atasks`, then `tasks.add`, `tasks.routed`, `atasks.aecho`. Never
  `from tests.tasks import routed` — a bare adjective at the call site says nothing
  about what runs, and it forces rename-aliases like `make_group as make_group_task`.
- **`from pytest_django import Settings`**, always, and annotate bare:
  `settings: Settings`. Never `pytest_django.fixtures.Settings`, quoted or otherwise — a
  quoted one passes the test run and fails mypy, so it survives until the slow gate.
- **Assert a boolean by identity: `is True` / `is False`**, never `assert x` or
  `assert not x`. Applies to every `.exists()` — `assert qs.exists() is False`, not
  `assert not qs.exists()`. Truthiness passes for the wrong object too: drop the
  `.exists()` call in a refactor and `assert qs` still passes on a non-empty queryset,
  while `is True` fails. Same for any predicate helper returning `bool`.
- **Shared fixtures live in the parent `tests/conftest.py`**, inherited by all four
  suites via `--confcutdir=..` in each suite's `pytest.toml` (each suite's rootdir is
  its own dir, so without `confcutdir` a parent conftest isn't discovered). Do NOT
  re-import fixtures into a suite conftest — a suite `conftest.py` holds only
  suite-specific fixtures. Per-test pg_cron isolation is not a suite-local fixture; it
  comes from the mechanisms described in [`../CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md).
- An **autouse `_enable_db(db)` fixture** (in `tests/conftest.py`) gives every test DB
  access — do NOT decorate tests with `@pytest.mark.django_db`. Only add
  `@pytest.mark.django_db(transaction=True)` (or markers for multi-DB / reset-sequences)
  when a test needs transactions/commits or DDL (`migrate`, `create_queue`).
- **Any test that EXECUTES anything — enqueue, drain, a worker, cleanup deleting rows —
  freezes time through the `dj_absurd` fixture**, not through time-machine directly:
  `with dj_absurd.freeze_time() as frozen_time:`, then
  `frozen_time.shift(Δ)`/`move_to(instant)`, enqueueing INSIDE the block — **never
  `time.sleep`**. It moves Postgres and Python together, which is mandatory: Postgres
  ahead of Python is an unkillable deadlock for a sync task. The fixture works unchanged
  in an `async def` test. See
  [Testing — the `dj_absurd` fixture](../docs/web/testing.md#the-dj_absurd-fixture).
  - **`tests/benchmarks` is exempt.** It drives a measurement harness through real
    `absurd_worker` children and real sleeps, and elapsed time on a real clock is the
    thing being measured; freezing either clock erases it.
- **`time_machine.travel(..., tick=False)` directly is for pure-Python math only** —
  cron arithmetic (`get_next_datetime`) and the like, where no row, worker, or Absurd
  deadline is involved. Reaching for the fixture there would write a database GUC for
  nothing; reaching for time-machine on an executing test leaves Postgres on real time
  (that mistake shipped once — `test_cleanup.py` passed only because `cleanup_ttl` was
  0). Two ticking uses are sanctioned:
  - `tests/core/test_scheduler.py`'s live worker crossing a `*/1` boundary, which needs
    real time to pass.
  - `tests/benchmarks/utils.py`'s `nap_the_wall_clock`, which walks `time.time` away
    from `perf_counter` on purpose — that disagreement is the only input the harness's
    suspension guard reads, so here the drift IS the phenomenon under test. The
    `dj_absurd` fixture is wrong twice over: it moves Postgres too, erasing the
    disagreement, and its GUC never reaches an `absurd_worker` child. Safe only because
    nothing in the harness's own process derives a database deadline from the wall clock
    — every drain deadline is monotonic and every recorded timestamp is a Postgres
    column.
- **freezegun is banned** — it patches `time.monotonic`, which IS asyncio's event-loop
  clock, so a frozen freezegun deadlocks the drain unkillably. Do not reintroduce it.
  `pytest-asyncio` is a dev dependency for writing `async def` tests; nothing in
  `django_absurd/` may depend on it.
- **A test needing the Absurd schema out of reach uses `utils.hide_absurd_schema()`** —
  it renames the schema and renames it back, so nothing is destroyed and no migration
  state moves. Never unapply migrations for this: it replays the whole install per test,
  and it stops working outright once a schema delta lands (Absurd publishes no downgrade
  SQL).
- **No monkeypatching / `unittest.mock.patch`.** Test observable behavior, not
  internals. If a test needs to patch our own functions to reach a branch, restructure
  so a real input drives that branch instead.
  - **One carve-out: the resolver that names the central pg_cron database.** An
    `absurd.E012` test may `monkeypatch`
    `django_absurd.connection.resolve_cron_database` to aim the probe at an
    extension-free database — the real central one has the extension, and no setting
    renames it. The guard state itself is a real input: `OPTIONS["PG_CRON_ON_TEST_DB"]`
    decides whether the fail-safe is inert under the suite, so never patch the
    environment-detection seam. The probe and the check must run for real. Use pytest's
    `monkeypatch`, never `unittest.mock.patch`.
- **Test at a high, behavioral level — through real entrypoints, never helper units.**
  - **Admin features are HTTP-tested**: drive the real request cycle (log in, then
    `client.get`/`post` the admin URLs) and assert observable side effects, not by
    calling admin/helper methods directly.
  - **Side effects belong on `.save()`/`.delete()` signals so they fire centrally** for
    the ORM save/delete paths (admin, direct ORM) — don't expose a standalone emitter
    for callers or tests to invoke. Exercise the effect through the write path and
    assert the outcome; don't unit-test the emitter in isolation. (Caveat:
    `QuerySet.update()` / `bulk_*` send no signals — call that out where it matters.)
  - **Never unit-test an internal helper** (a merge function, a serializer, a builder).
    Assert its behavior through the real objects that use it — construct a `Task`,
    enqueue it, run the command, and check the outcome. A test that calls the helper
    directly is a hollow implementation defence: it re-states the code, survives a wrong
    design, and dies on any refactor. If a helper's behavior has no observable
    expression yet, the test belongs in the later task that adds the surface that
    expresses it.
  - Reuse existing fixtures/utilities rather than re-rolling equivalents; inventory a
    suite's `conftest.py` and a sibling test before writing new ones.
  - **Don't wrap two lines in a helper.** Inline short setup (claiming a task, opening a
    cursor) at each call site rather than hiding it behind an indirection.
  - **A function that is never invoked gets no real body.** When a task or a decorator
    target exists only for its object, signature, decorator, or import path — enqueued
    but never run, or only inspected — a working body is dead code and a coverage miss.
    Applies to `@task` fixtures and to throwaway `def send_report(...)` stubs in guard
    tests alike. Two forms:
    - **`raise NotImplementedError` with a reason** — the default. Write it as the
      two-line errmsg-lint idiom and annotate `-> t.Never`:

      ```python
      def capped(a: int, b: int) -> t.Never:
          msg = "path-resolved for its decorator; never run"
          raise NotImplementedError(msg)
      ```

      `[tool.coverage.report] exclude_also` in `pyproject.toml` carries a regex for
      exactly this shape, so **both** lines are excluded — it costs nothing in coverage
      and still fails loudly if something ever does call it.

    - **A docstring and no body** — fine for a throwaway local stub. Also costs no
      counted lines, but the return annotation must be `-> None` or mypy raises
      `[empty-body]`, and an accidental call silently returns `None`.

    Save real bodies for tasks a worker or the immediate backend actually executes.
    **Check across every suite before concluding a shared fixture is never invoked** —
    `tests/tasks.py` is imported by all of them but each suite is a separate coverage
    run, so a body that looks dead under `tests/core` may be executed by `tests/pg_cron`
    (`capped` and `on_reports` are). Codecov combines the runs; a single local suite
    does not.

  - Name a variable for the thing it holds (its type/role), not a generic placeholder.
- **Test management commands AND system checks by running them**:
  `call_command("check", "django_absurd")` / `call_command("absurd_sync_queues")`,
  capture output with pytest `capsys`, and **assert on the emitted output, never on
  internal return values** — by equality against the whole of it, per the rule below.
- **A check test that must ERROR uses `pytest.raises(SystemCheckError)`**, not a helper
  that captures output — a helper passes whether or not the check fired, and the
  `try/except/else` shape it invites leaves an unreachable `else` that fails the
  patch-coverage gate (this recurred twice). The output-capturing helpers are for
  tolerant sweeps: asserting an ID is ABSENT, or reading several messages at once.
- Drive check/command states with real DB conditions (sync via the command; drop the
  schema; `override_settings` for an unreachable DB) — not mocks.
- HTTP mocking (when ever needed): the `responses` library, not `mock`.
- **Comment hygiene:** don't write comments that restate code or justify
  obviously-needed lines — let tests validate necessity. Remove noisy/distracting test
  comments.
- **Multi-entrypoint rule tests (validators):** one case table per rule, **parametrized
  over the real enforcing entrypoints** (`validate_<source>` subjects, e.g. the system
  check + `full_clean`), integration-style — never re-assert the same rule per
  entrypoint. Validators are pure functions raising `ValidationError`, enforced
  **model-first** (on the model + reused by the checks); a plain `VALID` baseline dict
  so a single override isolates one rule.
- **A rule that mirrors an external system gets a parity suite** beside the rule table,
  asserting the same expressions against that system directly — everything the rule
  accepts is accepted there, everything it rejects is rejected there, with the reject
  list DERIVED from the rule table so a new case cannot be added without the external
  system agreeing. Where we deliberately diverge, pin the external behaviour that
  justifies it in its own table, so the test fails (and tells us to drop the divergence)
  if the other side ever changes.
  `tests/pg_cron/test_pg_cron_grammar_matches_extension.py` is the worked example:
  pg_cron accepts a 6-field expression and silently truncates it, so our validator
  refuses what pg_cron allows.
- **Assert the whole captured output by equality, spelled out inline as a literal**,
  never a fragment (fragments are unreadable, brittle, and a `not in id` assertion goes
  vacuous the moment that id stops existing). No helper composes the expected string —
  repeating the literal per call site is the point.
- **Narrow `# type: ignore[...]` is expected when a test deliberately passes something
  the checker rejects** — our runtime error states are part of the public contract
  (users may not type-check at all), so they must be exercised. This is the one place
  ignores don't need asking for; keep them narrow (specific error code) and on the
  offending line only. `warn_unused_ignores` (on via `strict`) fails the build if the
  error stops occurring, so a stale ignore can't hide a regressed guard.
- **Always alphabetize** `@pytest.mark.parametrize` values and fixture `params`.
- **Alphabetize a test function's own fixture parameters** too (e.g.
  `def test_x(admin_user: User, client: Client)`, not `client` then `admin_user`) — no
  ruff/flake8-pytest-style rule enforces this (checked; no `PT0xx` rule covers parameter
  order), so it's a manual convention only.

## Fast iteration

Measured on this repo; the point is to spend the slow gate once, not per edit.

- **Iterate with a targeted, coverage-free run:** `uv run pytest <path> -q --no-cov`.
  Every suite's `pytest.toml` turns coverage on via `addopts`, and that instrumentation
  dominates a single-file run; `-q` keeps the output scannable.
- **Run `tox -e dev` once, before the commit** — not after every edit. It is ~2.5
  minutes because it builds four suites; nothing about a one-file change needs that
  loop.
- **`-n4` for a whole-suite run**, which every suite tolerates including
  `tests/pg_cron`. Skip it for a single file, where the worker spin-up costs more than
  it saves.
- **Reach for `--create-db` when failures stop making sense.** A killed frozen test can
  leave a database-level `absurd.fake_now` behind, which makes later durable tests
  unclaimable for reasons invisible in their own code. Rebuild before diagnosing.
- **Changing the worker count needs `--create-db` once.** `--reuse-db` keys test
  databases per worker (`…_gw0`), so going from 2 workers to 6 reuses two and builds
  four, and the mixed state surfaces as
  `DuplicateFunction: function "current_time" already exists` — a migration error that
  reads like a code bug and is not one.
- **A test asserting `Created: <queue>` needs `_isolate_queues`** or a queue name unique
  to its file. The catalog row outlives the per-test flush, so the second `--reuse-db`
  run of that file reports nothing created. Passes alone, fails on repeat.
- **A deadlock/duplicate-key storm across unrelated tests means a concurrent run**, not
  a code defect — suites from a worktree reach this checkout's Postgres on 5442 unless
  it exported its own `PGPORT`/`PGPORT_PGCRON`. Confirm nothing else is running before
  bisecting.

### When an agent runs the gates

The full `tox -e dev` exceeds a subagent's foreground command limit, so the harness
backgrounds it and the subagent ends its turn reporting "waiting for the run" — a dead
cycle that costs more than the run. Have implementers run only the targeted tests and
`pre-commit`, and let the coordinator own the `tox` gate after the commit. Measured on
this repo, 2026-08-04: the same task shape took ~160s under that split versus 500-900s
when the implementer owned `tox`.
