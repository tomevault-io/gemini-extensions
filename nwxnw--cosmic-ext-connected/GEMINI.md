Guidance for Claude Code when working with cosmic-ext-connected.

## Project Overview

Connected is a panel applet for the COSMIC™ desktop environment providing phone-to-desktop connectivity. It uses KDE Connect's daemon (`kdeconnectd`) as a D-Bus backend while providing a native libcosmic UI.

**Key Principle:** This project does NOT modify KDE Connect. It consumes kdeconnectd as a D-Bus service.

## Release Management

- **`main`** — sole development branch (no stable release branches yet)
- **`v0.1.0`** tag exists as a historical marker for the first GitHub release
- All work (features and fixes) goes to `main` directly or via `feature/*` branches
- A release branch will be created when the project is published to a Flatpak repository or package archive

## Build Commands

```bash
cargo build                              # Build all crates
cargo build --release                    # Build release
cargo run -p cosmic-ext-connected        # Run (requires COSMIC)
cargo test && cargo clippy               # Test and lint
just install                             # Install to system
just uninstall                           # Uninstall
```

**Development cycle:** `cargo build --release && sudo just install && killall cosmic-panel`

**Flatpak build:**
```bash
flatpak-builder --user --install --force-clean build-dir io.github.nwxnw.cosmic-ext-connected.json
gtk-update-icon-cache -f ~/.local/share/flatpak/exports/share/icons/hicolor/  # Force icon cache refresh
killall cosmic-panel                     # Reload panel
```

**Flatpak sandbox permissions** (in `finish-args` of manifest):
- `--filesystem=xdg-config/cosmic:rw` — read/write COSMIC config
- `--filesystem=xdg-data/kpeoplevcard:ro` — read contacts for SMS name resolution
- `--filesystem=xdg-cache/kdeconnect.daemon:ro` — read MMS attachment cache (daemon uses Qt app name `"kdeconnect.daemon"` → cache at `~/.cache/kdeconnect.daemon/`)

**Debug logs:** `journalctl --user SYSLOG_IDENTIFIER=cosmic-ext-connected -f` (logs land here directly via `tracing_journald`; see `cosmic-applets/Logging and Diagnostics in COSMIC Applets.md` in the Auxis vault for routing details)

## Key Conventions

### Internationalization
All user-visible text must use `fl!()` macro:
```rust
text(fl!("devices"))
text(fl!("battery-level", level = battery_percent))
```

### D-Bus Property Naming
KDE Connect uses camelCase. Always specify explicit names in zbus:
```rust
#[zbus(property, name = "isCharging")]
fn is_charging(&self) -> zbus::Result<bool>;
```

### Module Organization
- `Message` enum stays in `app.rs` - all modules import from app
- `ConnectApplet` struct stays in `app.rs` - centralized state
- View functions take params structs, return `Element<Message>`
- Async functions are standalone, return `Message` variants

### Icons
- **Panel icons** use `fill="currentColor"` (symbolic) so COSMIC themes them automatically
- **App icon** uses hardcoded `fill="#BEBEBE"` because COSMIC Settings does not theme non-symbolic app icons
- **All icon filenames are prefixed with the app ID** (`io.github.nwxnw.cosmic-ext-connected*`) so Flatpak exports them to the host. Icons without the app-ID prefix are silently excluded from Flatpak export (non-allowed export filename), breaking icon rendering in COSMIC Settings for Flatpak installs.
- Device icon everywhere is `"io.github.nwxnw.cosmic-ext-connected-symbolic"` (our custom mobile phone icon)
- Panel connected state: `"io.github.nwxnw.cosmic-ext-connected-symbolic"`, disconnected: `"io.github.nwxnw.cosmic-ext-connected-disconnected-symbolic"`
- Disconnected icon follows Pop convention: main element at `opacity="0.35"`, X indicator at full opacity

### UI Theming
- Back navigation buttons use `cosmic::theme::Button::Link` (accent-colored icon and text, no background)
- Headings adjacent to back buttons use `cosmic::theme::Text::Accent`
- To accent-color an icon widget, convert `Named` to `Icon` first, then apply `Svg::custom`:
  ```rust
  icon::from_name("icon-name").size(48).icon()
      .class(cosmic::theme::Svg::custom(|theme| {
          cosmic::iced::widget::svg::Style {
              color: Some(theme.cosmic().accent_text_color().into()),
          }
      }))
  ```
  Note: `svg::Style` lives at `cosmic::iced::widget::svg::Style` (the consumer re-export). Reaching for `cosmic::iced_widget::svg::Style` — which is libcosmic's *internal* path — won't resolve from consumer crates.

### Code Style
- Follow rustfmt and clippy
- Prefer explicit error handling over `.unwrap()`
- Use `fl!()` for all UI strings

## D-Bus Interface Pitfalls

### Two `requestConversation` methods (different behavior)
The daemon exposes `requestConversation` on two interfaces with **different behavior**:

- **`org.kde.kdeconnect.device.sms`** (at `/devices/{id}/sms`): Sends a network packet to the phone. The response flows through `addMessages()` which populates the daemon's in-memory `m_conversations` cache. Use this to prime the cache.
- **`org.kde.kdeconnect.device.conversations`** (at `/devices/{id}`): Creates a `RequestConversationWorker` that reads from a local persistent store and emits `conversationUpdated` D-Bus signals, but does **NOT** populate `m_conversations`.

We fire both: SMS plugin first (cache priming), then Conversations interface (per-message signals for UI).

### Contact loading is per-device and loaded once
`ContactLookup` parses vCard files from `~/.local/share/kpeoplevcard/kdeconnect-{device-id}/`. Contacts are loaded once when the SMS view opens and preserved across view re-opens for the same device. They are only cleared when switching to a different device. This avoids a race condition where async contact loading completes after the conversation list has already rendered with phone numbers.

### Group display names
`ContactLookup::get_group_display_name(&addresses, limit)` resolves multiple addresses into comma-separated contact names (e.g. "Alice, Bob, Charlie, ..."). Used in the conversation list, thread header, and SMS notifications. Per-message sender labels use `get_name_or_number` for the individual message sender.

### `conversationLoaded` signal count is unreliable
`conversationLoaded(threadId, messageCount)` fires when the Conversations interface finishes reading its local persistent store. The `messageCount` reflects **how many messages were in the local store**, not the phone's total. After a reboot, the local store may have 0-1 messages even for conversations with hundreds. Never use this count for pagination decisions — use `messages.len() >= messages_per_page` as a heuristic instead.

### Message subscription runs until the conversation closes
`conversation_message_subscription` in `subscriptions.rs` uses a state machine (`Init` → `Listening`) that runs as long as the conversation is open:
- **Phase 1:** Local store signals (`conversationUpdated` per message, then `conversationLoaded`). Hard timeout safety net (20s) in case `conversationLoaded` never arrives.
- **Phase 2:** After `conversationLoaded`, `phone_deadline` (8s, `PHONE_RESPONSE_TIMEOUT_MS`) waits for the phone to respond. When it fires, `ConversationLoadComplete` is emitted but the subscription continues listening.
- **Phase 3:** After load complete, the subscription uses a 30s heartbeat sleep while listening for new messages (including sent message echoes for optimistic reconciliation).
- The subscription is cancelled when iced drops it (`conversation_load_active` set to false in `CloseConversation`).
- There is no activity timeout. This matches the conversation list subscription pattern and all three reference implementations.

`initial_load_complete` tracks whether the initial load phase is done (Phase 2 → Phase 3 transition). This flag gates scroll prefetch — prefetch must wait until initial load finishes to avoid collecting duplicate D-Bus signals.

### Scroll prefetch must wait for initial load to complete
`MessageThreadScrolled` triggers `fetch_older_messages_async` when the user scrolls near the top. This fires a separate `requestConversation` which picks up D-Bus signals on the same session bus. If the initial message load is still running, the prefetch collects the **same signals** and `OlderMessagesLoaded` prepends duplicates. Guard: `self.initial_load_complete` in the prefetch condition. Safety net: `OlderMessagesLoaded` filters `older_msgs` against `known_message_ids` before prepending.

### Conversation list subscription runs until the view closes
`conversation_list_subscription` in `conversation_subscription.rs` uses a state machine (`Init` → `EmittingCached` → `Listening`) that runs as long as the SMS view is open:
- **`phone_deadline`** — absolute `Instant` for how long to show the sync spinner. 8s on cold start (no cache), 3s on warm start (has cache). When it fires, `ConversationSyncComplete` is emitted to dismiss the UI spinner, but the subscription continues listening silently.
- After the phone deadline fires, the subscription uses a 30s heartbeat sleep to keep the unfold alive while waiting for signals.
- The subscription is cancelled when iced drops it (`conversation_list_subscription_active` set to false in `CloseSmsView` or `SmsError`).
- There is no activity timeout or hard timeout. This matches the pattern used by KDE Connect SMS desktop, GSConnect, and hepp3n — none of which have a "loading done" concept.

Cached conversations from `activeConversations()` are emitted immediately via `EmittingCached` for instant UI display.

### COSMIC's notification daemon ignores `expire_timeout`
COSMIC's notification daemon does not respect the `expire_timeout` hint from the freedesktop notification spec. All notifications display for the daemon's fixed duration regardless of the value passed. To implement user-configurable notification duration, notifications must be created with `Timeout::Never` (expire_timeout=0) to prevent the daemon from auto-closing them, then explicitly closed via `NotificationHandle::close()` after the configured timeout. This is handled by `show_and_auto_close()` in `app.rs`.

### Ping notifications cannot be intercepted via D-Bus
KDE Connect's ping plugin (`kdeconnect_ping`) does not emit D-Bus signals for incoming pings. When a ping is received, `kdeconnectd` handles it internally and sends a desktop notification directly via `KNotification`, bypassing any D-Bus signal mechanism. The applet cannot detect or replace incoming ping notifications. The ping plugin only exposes `sendPing()` methods (outgoing), not incoming signals.

### SMS sending: `replyToConversation` for replies, `sendWithoutConversation` for new messages
Replies use `replyToConversation(threadId, message, attachments)`, which looks up addresses from the daemon's `m_conversations[threadId]` cache. This cache is reliably primed when the user opens a conversation (our SMS plugin `requestConversation` call populates it via `addMessages()`). Using `replyToConversation` preserves thread context for group messages.

**Caveat:** `replyToConversation` silently no-ops if the cache is empty (no D-Bus error). The KDE Connect desktop SMS app uses it the same way with no fallback. See `reference/reply-to-conversation-analysis.md` for detection/fallback options if this proves unreliable.

New messages (no existing thread) use `sendWithoutConversation(addresses, message, attachments)` with explicit addresses. Both methods are on the same Conversations D-Bus interface.

### Optimistic sent message display
When a reply is sent successfully (`SmsSendResult(Ok(_))`), an optimistic `SmsMessage` with `OPTIMISTIC_MESSAGE_UID` (`i32::MIN`) is inserted into `self.messages` immediately. This provides instant visual feedback — the message appears as a right-aligned bubble with a spinning "Sending..." indicator instead of a timestamp.

When the phone echoes the real message back via `ConversationMessageReceived`, the optimistic entry is reconciled: body + type + 5-minute time window matching upgrades the sentinel UID and timestamp in-place. The message subscription runs for the lifetime of the conversation view, so the echo is caught naturally without any subscription restart.

Guard: `sms_sending_body.is_some()` prevents duplicate insertion if the echo arrives before `SmsSendResult`. The existing `confirmed_send` logic handles that edge case.

### KDE Connect daemon cache path is `kdeconnect.daemon`, not `kdeconnect`
KDE Connect's daemon sets its Qt application name to `"kdeconnect.daemon"` in `kdeconnectd.cpp`. Qt's `QStandardPaths::CacheLocation` resolves to `~/.cache/<applicationName>/`, so MMS attachments are cached at `~/.cache/kdeconnect.daemon/<device-name>/<uniqueIdentifier>` (e.g. `PART_1762553269778`). Files have no extension — the MIME type comes from the message's attachment metadata. The Flatpak manifest must include `--filesystem=xdg-cache/kdeconnect.daemon:ro` for the applet to read cached attachments.
