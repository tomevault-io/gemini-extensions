# Payload Components — Agent Guide

Read this first. It's the single source of truth for agents working in this repo. `CLAUDE.md` points here. Humans: see also `README.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` (this file links, it doesn't repeat setup).

## What this is

Payload Components is an **open-source, community-first** registry + CLI that installs Payload CMS blocks into consumer **Payload v3 + Next.js** projects — _wired, not pasted_. A plain `shadcn add` only copies files; `payload-components add` also does the Payload wiring (registers the block in the collection, maps the renderer, regenerates types + the admin import map) and lands it as a reviewable git diff.

This repository is **two things at once**:

1. The **Fumadocs-powered Next.js site** — the marketing landing, docs, and component catalog (this is what's deployed).
2. The **`payload-components` registry + CLI** — the tooling that distributes components into _other_ people's repos.

It is **not** a Payload CMS runtime app: no admin, no database, no `PAYLOAD_SECRET` for the site.

## Project positioning — community-first

The North Star is **open-source, MIT, community-first**. No pricing, no license keys, no gated tiers, no sales funnel. Success is adoption and contributions, not revenue — the catalog grows from real installs and PRs. Keep all copy, docs, and issue templates aligned to that. If you find commercial / "sellable" framing (pricing hedges, "design partner" or "early access" funnels, paid-tier roadmaps), treat it as stale residue and reframe it community-first.

## The mental model (internalize this one split)

|            | Site runtime                  | Component distribution                              |
| ---------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Lives in   | `src/`, `content/docs/`       | `payload-components/`, `tools/payload-components/`         |
| Runs       | here (Fumadocs / Next.js)     | in the _consumer's_ repo, after install       |
| Payload?   | none (docs site only)         | the installed component code **is** Payload target code |

The Payload block code under `payload-components/source/` is **target code** — shipped into consumer repos, never executed by this site. Don't import it into the site, and don't run the site against a database.

## Repo map

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `src/app/` | Routes: `/` (landing), `/docs/[[...slug]]` (Fumadocs), `/components` (catalog), `/about`, `/api/search`, `llms.txt` · `llms-full.txt` · `llms.mdx` (AI surfaces), `og/` + `opengraph-image` |
| `src/components/site/` | Site UI: `SiteHeader`/`SiteFooter`, `HeroProductFrame` + `HeroInstallReplay` (the install replay), `WiringLedger`, `ComponentSpecimen`/`ComponentCard`/`ComponentGrid`, `Faq`, `CommandCopyButton`, `section.tsx` |
| `src/components/site/sections/` | Landing sections (Hero, StackBand, Tax, Workflow, Wiring, Catalog, Faq, CommunityCta). `src/app/page.tsx` just orchestrates these |
| `src/components/site/demos/` | **Demo twins** — live previews that mirror component source class-for-class (see Core flows) |
| `src/lib/site.ts` | **Single source of truth for all site copy/data** (hero text, FAQ, component entries, landing-section headings, terminal demo lines). Tests import from here |
| `content/docs/` | Fumadocs MDX (index, architecture, installation, registry, contributing, `components/*`); page tree via `meta.json` |
| `payload-components/` | `registry.json` (source shadcn registry), `source/` (component target code), `manifests/*.json` (wiring contract), `schema/`, `support-matrix.json` |
| `tools/payload-components/` + `bin/payload-components.mjs` | The CLI: `add` command, project detection, fragment patching, install state, registry build/check |
| `tests/` | `e2e/` (Playwright) + `int/` (Vitest) — the contract (below) |
| `public/r/` | Generated public registry — **gitignored build output**, never hand-edit |

## Core flows

**`payload-components add <component>` pipeline** (`tools/payload-components/commands/add.ts`) — five idempotent stages; install state is recorded in the consumer's `.payload-components/state.json`:

`registry-build` → `registry-add` → `dependency-install` → `fragment-apply` → `post-install` (`generate:types`, `generate:importmap`)

Fragment patching is **text-anchor based** — it finds anchors like `const blockComponents = {` and `name: 'layout'` in the consumer repo and inserts imports/registrations with dedup checks. Fragile by design for now; keep the anchors and dedup logic intact.

**Two install modes:**

- _payload-components-required_ page blocks (`hero-basic`, `feature-grid-basic`) — need the full wiring above.
- _shadcn-native_ post components (in development) — file-only `shadcn add`, no Payload wiring.

**Registry generation:** `payload-components/registry.json` → `public/r` via `shadcn build` (`pnpm registry:build`); `pnpm test:registry` checks the generated output is reproducible.

**Demo twins:** the landing renders _real_ component components as live previews. Each twin in `src/components/site/demos/` must **mirror its component source's `className` literals verbatim** (enforced by `tests/int/demo-twins.int.spec.ts`), stay `aria-hidden`, and contain no interactive elements or headings. Edit a component's source → update its twin in the same change.

## Where to change things

| Task | Touch |
| --- | --- |
| Add a component | `payload-components/source/` + `manifests/<component>.json` + `registry.json` + `content/docs/components/<component>.mdx` + installer tests — **all together** (incomplete components don't ship). Scaffold + step-by-step workflow: `payload-components/templates/component-template/` (copy its files; its README is the canonical add-a-component workflow) |
| Site copy / messaging | `src/lib/site.ts` |
| Landing layout / visuals | `src/components/site/sections/` + `src/app/globals.css` |
| Docs content | `content/docs/` |
| CLI behavior | `tools/payload-components/` |

## The contract you must not break

Any change must keep these green:

- **`tests/e2e/frontend.e2e.spec.ts`** — H1 === `heroHeadline`; every `landingSections` heading renders as an `<h2>`; the first `<code>` is `primaryInstallCommand` and the first **Copy** button copies it; forced-light (no `.dark`, light background); **no horizontal overflow** on `/`, `/docs`, `/docs/architecture`, `/components`, `/about`, and component pages; under reduced-motion the terminal replay still shows its final transcript line.
- **`tests/e2e/geo.e2e.spec.ts`** — `llms.txt` / `llms-full.txt` / `/api/search` / per-page markdown / OG images.
- **`tests/e2e/components-visual.e2e.spec.ts`** — each component's demo twin matches its committed per-platform visual baseline (rendered chrome-free at `/components/preview/<slug>`). Refactors should stay visually inert; only regenerate baselines for intended visual changes with `pnpm test:e2e components-visual --update-snapshots`, or mint them in the CI renderer with the `visual-baselines` workflow (CI is linux — the linux `*-chromium-linux.png` baselines must be minted there or the suite skips on the gate, so run the workflow once and merge the PR it opens). A case skips when its current-platform baseline is missing; once the platform has any baseline, a coverage guard fails the gate if a component is missing one.
- **`tests/int/`** — demo-twin class-mirror fidelity; **component visual standards** (`visual-standards.int.spec.ts`: token-only colours, named radius/letter-spacing tokens, no arbitrary colour/radius/tracking/spacing/font values — add a token in `globals.css` rather than an arbitrary value); registry reproducible; install idempotent and recoverable.

If you add a `landingSections` key, render its `<h2>` in the same change. The copy strings tests rely on (`heroHeadline`, `primaryInstallCommand`, `landingSections.*`, `componentEntries`, `terminalDemoLines`, `catalogTitle`) live in `src/lib/site.ts` — don't rename or retext them casually.

## Architecture Boundary

- Keep the public site in `src/app`, `src/components`, `src/lib`, and `content/docs`.
- Keep installable Payload target code in `payload-components/source`.
- Keep wrapper metadata in `payload-components/manifests`, `payload-components/schema`, and `payload-components/support-matrix.json`.
- Keep CLI behavior in `tools/payload-components` and `bin/payload-components.mjs`.
- Do not reintroduce Payload admin routes, collections, globals, database adapters, seed endpoints, waitlist APIs, preview routes, or `PAYLOAD_SECRET` requirements for the docs site.

## Registry Contract

- `payload-components/registry.json` is the source shadcn registry.
- Generated registry output belongs in ignored `public/r`.
- Registry file entries may read from `payload-components/source`, but their `target` paths must install into consumer repos under `~/src/...`.
- New components must include source files, manifest metadata, docs, and installer tests together.
- Direct shadcn installs only deliver files and public shadcn dependencies. `payload-components add` owns Payload-specific wiring, post-install scripts, and install state.

## shadcn registry directory submission

The registry is published under the `@payload-components` namespace and is shaped for listing in the
[official shadcn registry directory](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/directory) (so people can discover it
and run `shadcn add @payload-components/<item>`). `pnpm registry:validate` schema-checks every item
against the vendored shadcn schemas (`tools/payload-components/schemas/`) and runs inside the release gate.

**Submit only after** the changes are merged and deployed, so the live URL resolves and passes the
shadcn team's `validate:registries` check:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://www.payload-components.xyz/r/registry.json    # 200
curl -fsSL https://www.payload-components.xyz/r/hero-basic.json   # 200, embeds file content
```

**Steps:** fork [`shadcn-ui/ui`](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui), append the entry below to
`apps/v4/registry/directory.json` (the file is a JSON array; insert alphabetically by `name`; keep the
literal `{name}` placeholder in `url`), open the PR, and let their CI run `pnpm validate:registries`.

```json
{
  "name": "@payload-components",
  "homepage": "https://www.payload-components.xyz",
  "url": "https://www.payload-components.xyz/r/{name}.json",
  "description": "MIT registry of typed Payload CMS blocks for Payload v3 + Next.js. Each block installs as reviewable source; the companion CLI also wires collection config, RenderBlocks, types, and the admin import map."
}
```

Confirm at submission time: whether `logo` is required (existing entries carry an SVG string) and any
length cap on `description`. Our `registry:validate` covers item-schema validity regardless of whether
their script re-fetches each item URL.

## Variants and Shared Code

This is the canonical model for every component family. `content/docs/architecture.mdx` carries the narrative version.

- A structural variant is its own registry item and manifest — `hero-basic`, `hero-video`, `hero-dramatic`. Never an interactive variant prompt. Suffix every variant; do not ship a bare family name. Selection happens in the catalog, not the CLI.
- Content-level variation (optional or extra editor fields) belongs in the Payload block config, not a new component.
- Share code across a family with a real source file every variant ships: add it under `payload-components/source/blocks/shared`, list it in the variant's registry item `files[]` (with a `~/src/...` target) and the manifest `files[]`, and compose it in the config — e.g. `payload-components/source/blocks/shared/heroFields.ts` → `~/src/blocks/shared/heroFields.ts`, used as `fields: [...heroFields, /* variant-specific */]`.
- Do NOT use `registryDependencies` for internal shared modules. That path resolves only public shadcn UI components (it checks `components/ui/<name>.tsx` and runs `shadcn add <name>`); an internal name will 404.
- When a component's installed file set changes, sync the hand-maintained landing ledgers in `src/lib/site.ts` (`terminalDemoLines`, `frameInstalledFiles`, `wiringLedger`) and the component's `content/docs/components/<name>.mdx` page.

## Component doc page format

Every component doc page (`content/docs/components/<slug>.mdx`) follows one fixed shape — a shadcn-style
component page. Match it exactly when adding or editing a component; do not invent per-component layouts.

- **Header is automatic.** `src/app/docs/[[...slug]]/page.tsx` detects `/docs/components/*` and renders
  `ComponentDocHeader` — title + description + at-a-glance chips (`v{version} · Page block · {Family}
  family · {target}`, from `componentEntries`) on the left; Copy Page + prev/next arrows (catalog order)
  on the right. The component **must** be in `componentEntries` (`src/lib/site.ts`). Do **not** add an `<h1>` or
  repeat the description in the MDX body — frontmatter drives both.
- **Frontmatter:** `title` (must equal the component's `componentEntries` title — the e2e component-page loop asserts
  `H1 === component.title`), `description`, `icon` (any Lucide name).
- **The rich sections are data-driven from the manifest/registry** (via `src/lib/component-manifest.ts`),
  so the MDX stays thin and the sections can't drift from what installs. Body order, nothing above
  the preview:
  1. `<ComponentPreview slug="<slug>" />` — **Preview** (demo twin from
     `src/components/site/demos/registry.ts`) + **Code** (every installed source file — `config.ts`,
     `Component.tsx`, shared `*Fields.ts` — read at build via `getComponentSources` in
     `src/lib/component-source.ts`) tabs. A new component **must** register a demo twin, or the preview is empty.
  2. `## Installation` — `<Tabs items={['Command', 'Manual']}>`: Command = `npx payload-components add
     <slug>`; Manual = the direct `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add …/r/<slug>.json` URL.
  3. `## What it installs` — `<ComponentWiring slug="<slug>" />`: the copied files + a factual table of the
     edits the install makes (register the block, map the renderer, regenerate types + import map) +
     shared-base callout + idempotency note, all from the manifest. State facts — **not** a
     shadcn comparison; that pitch belongs on the landing, not the reference. Do **not**
     hand-write the file tree or fragment list.
  4. `## Content model` — `<TypeTable>` of the block fields (+ a second table for array-item fields).
     The one hand-authored section; note which fields come from the shared family base vs the variant.
  5. `## Usage` — `<ComponentUsage slug="<slug>" />`: the admin steps (add the block to a Page → fill → publish).
  6. `## Requirements` — `<ComponentRequirements slug="<slug>" />`: target, Payload/Next majors, shadcn deps.
  7. `## In this family` — `<ComponentFamily slug="<slug>" />`: sibling variants. Include this section
     **only when the family has 2+ variants** (it renders nothing for a lone variant — omit the
     heading too, e.g. `hero-basic` has none yet).
- **Keep the install command and Content-model prose in MDX**, never in page chrome — the `/llms*`
  and per-page markdown surfaces serialize MDX, and `tests/e2e/geo.e2e.spec.ts` pins exact
  install-command substrings. Data-driven sections must scroll/stack inside their cards (no page
  overflow; the ledger stacks under `md`).

## Payload Target Safety

Payload code in this repo is target code for consumer projects. When editing it:

- Use TypeScript and real Payload types.
- Keep block configs explicit: `slug`, `interfaceName`, `labels.singular`, and `labels.plural`.
- Preserve optional wrapper props such as `id`, `className`, and `disableInnerContainer` on frontend blocks.
- If adding Local API examples that pass `user`, set `overrideAccess: false`.
- If adding hooks with nested Payload operations, pass `req` to nested operations.
- Use context flags for hook-driven updates that could otherwise trigger loops.
- When inspecting or transforming Payload fields, use Payload's exported field type guards instead of unsafe casts.

## Validation

Run the smallest useful check while iterating, then run the release gate before shipping:

```bash
pnpm lint
pnpm source:build
pnpm exec tsc --noEmit
pnpm test:registry
pnpm run test:int
pnpm run test:e2e
pnpm build
```

`pnpm test:release` runs the full local gate. `pnpm test:fresh` is the slower external Payload smoke test for pre-release or nightly confidence.

**Gotchas:**

- Fresh worktree/clone: run `pnpm install` then **`pnpm source:build`** before `dev`/`tsc` (Fumadocs compiles `content/docs` → `.source/`; otherwise types fail on missing `.source/`).
- e2e uses `E2E_PORT` (default `3100`) to avoid common local `3000` contention.
- The site is **forced light** (`forcedTheme: 'light'`); there is no dark mode. The terminal/maintainer cards are intentionally dark surfaces via `--terminal-*` / `bg-foreground` tokens, not `dark:` variants.
- Fonts (Geist Sans/Mono + Instrument Serif accent) load via `next/font` with their CSS variables on `<html>`. Keep them on `<html>` or the Tailwind v4 `@theme` font tokens silently break.

## Branch & release flow

- **`dev`** = integration branch; **`main`** = production (protected, gated by the `pr-gate` check). Work on a feature branch → open a PR into `dev` → promote `dev → main` via PR. Direct pushes to `main` are blocked.

## Deeper docs

- `README.md` — quickstart and what-lives-where.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — local setup, good first contributions, PR checklist.
- `payload-components/README.md` — the registry/manifest contract in depth.
- `content/docs/{architecture,installation,registry}.mdx` — the user-facing system docs.
