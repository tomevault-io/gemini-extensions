# Agent context — this.gui

Agent context for the monorepo as a whole lives in `all.this/AGENTS.md` — read
that one first for the mesh/NRP argument and cross-package state. This file is
the GUI-specific counterpart: what this package *is*, how it's put together
internally, and the landmines specific to it. `CLAUDE.md` (repo root) has the
authoritative build/dev commands — this file does not repeat them.

If you only have this repo checked out standalone (not nested inside
`all.this`), find the parent at the `all.this` repo under the `neurons-me`
GitHub org.

## What this.gui is

`this.gui` ("Generative User Interfaces") is a React component library with
**two authoring paths that share one component surface**:

1. **React-first (JSX)** — import components and compose them directly, like
   any component library. This is the path most app code should use.
2. **Declarative (spec tree)** — build a `GuiSpecNode` (`{ type, props,
   children, provenance }`, plain data, not a React element) and hand it to
   `renderNode()` / `mount()` / `SpecBoundary`. This is the path for
   LLM-generated UI, data-driven admin panels, and anything that needs the
   Semantic Inspector to see every node. `type` can be a string (resolved
   against a registry) or a real component reference.

Both paths render the *same* underlying components — a spec node with
`type: 'Button'` and a `<Button>` JSX element end up rendering the same
`Button.tsx`. What differs is who builds the tree and whether nodes get
registered for inspection.

Composition contract (see `README.md` for the full walkthrough):

```
Theme → Layout → view
```

`Theme` is the visual environment (tokens, mode). `Layout` is the chrome —
`TopBar` / `LeftBar` / `RightBar` / `Footer`. Your view fills the content
area. Components are organized **atoms → molecules → compounds**: primitives
compose into patterns, patterns compose into features.

## Package surface (subpath exports)

Each subpath is a separate Vite lib entry (see `vite.config.js`, `entry: {...}`)
with its own ES + CJS output — importing one does not pull in the others.

| Entry | Source | What it gives you |
|---|---|---|
| `this.gui` | `index.ts` | `Theme`, `Layout`, `ThemeLauncher`, and most top-level components (explicit exports only — see rule below) |
| `this.gui/atoms` | `src/gui/Atoms/atoms.ts` | Primitives — `Box`, `Button`, `Typography`, `Icon`, … |
| `this.gui/molecules` | `src/gui/Molecules/molecules.ts` | Compositions — `Hero`, `Stack`, `Page`, … |
| `this.gui/compounds` (alias `/components`) | `src/gui/Compounds/compounds.ts` | Feature panels built from molecules |
| `this.gui/react` | `src/react-entry.ts` | `.me` bridge — `MeRuntimeProvider`, `useMeValue`, `useMeAction` |
| `this.gui/runtime` | `src/runtime-entry.ts` | `mount`, `mountApp`, `declareApp`, `createMeRuntime`, `writeMeValue`/`readMeValue`, `renderNode` |
| `this.gui/devtools` | `src/devtools-entry.ts` | Semantic Inspector / admin view, opt-in only |
| `this.gui/cleaker` | `src/cleaker-entry.ts` | Framework-free X-Me-Proof signing (`signedRequest`, `deriveCleakerNode`, `fetchGatewayHostname`) |
| `this.gui/legacy` | `src/legacy/index.tsx` | UMD/global compatibility facade |
| `this.gui/style.css` | `dist/styles.css` | Compiled stylesheet |

**Root barrel rule** (`index.ts`, stated at the top of the file): no
`export *`. Every root export is explicit, and pulled from a concrete module
path (`@/gui/Atoms/Button/Button`), never re-exported through a barrel. This
keeps the root entry tree-shakeable and its public surface intentional. When
adding a new root export, follow the existing pattern — explicit named
export, concrete import path, not a wildcard.

## Two build outputs, one source

This package ships **both** an ESM/CJS npm package (multi-entry, tree-shaken,
for bundler consumers) **and** a single-file UMD/IIFE bundle (for `<script>`
tag consumption with global `window.React`/`window.GUI`, used by
`netget`'s static `namespace-surface` HTML shell and by `monad`'s HTML
bootstrap). Same `index.ts` root, two build passes (`UMD_TARGET=core` vs the
multi-entry pass) — see `vite.config.js`. React/ReactDOM stay external peer
deps in both modes; the UMD build additionally bundles router + JSX runtime
so it works standalone without extra global shims.

**This dual consumption is a real constraint on how you write root-barrel
code**, not just a build detail — see the react-reconciler landmine below.

## Declarative runtime — the pieces, bottom to top

- **`GuiSpecNode`** (`src/types/gui.types.ts`) — the data shape:
  `{ type, props?, children?, parts?, provenance? }`. `provenance` carries
  `semanticPath` / `explainPath` / `source` / `note` — what the Semantic
  Inspector's "Explain" panel shows for a node. A node with no `provenance`
  shows as "Not declared", which is fine for structural chrome but should be
  filled in for anything that reads/writes `.me`.
- **`renderNode()`** (`src/runtime/renderer.ts`) — the low-level spec → React
  element function. Resolves `type` (string via registry lookup, or a direct
  component/element/Fragment-like symbol), resolves `props` through a
  `RuntimeAdapter` (below), and — if `onNodeResolved` is passed — schedules a
  `ResolvedNodeRecord` callback via `queueMicrotask` for **every** node in the
  tree. That microtask deferral is deliberate: it fires after React's
  synchronous render/commit pass, so registration can't be done from a
  same-pass `useLayoutEffect` (see `SpecBoundary`/`mount.ts` below).
- **`resolveType()`** — string `type` → component. Checks, in order: an
  explicit `registry` option, dotted paths (`Atoms.Button`), then a direct
  lookup on `gui` (the UMD global surface). `Registry/GuiRegistry.ts` is the
  canonical registry: every registrable component ships a sibling
  `Component.resolver.tsx` exporting a `RegistryEntry`
  (`{ type, meta, resolve(spec, ctx) }`) that maps a JSON-friendly spec into
  real props — see `Button.resolver.tsx` for the pattern (destructure known
  spec fields, decide polymorphic `component`, spread the rest). New
  registrable components need both the component file *and* a resolver
  wired into `GuiRegistry.ts`'s import list.
- **Read/write tokens** — dynamic props are `{ read: 'me/profile/name' }` or
  `{ write: 'me/profile/status = ...' }` (legacy aliases `$expr`/`$action`
  still work), resolved through the `RuntimeAdapter` passed as `runtime`.
  Interpolation (`{{params.id}}`) reads from `ctx`. See `Runtime-Contract.md`
  for the full token/router contract — that file is the up-to-date spec, this
  file doesn't restate it.
- **`RuntimeAdapter`** (`src/runtime/adapter.ts`) — the pluggable interface
  (`resolve`, `action`, `subscribe`, `batchResolve`, …) that makes read/write
  tokens live. `createMeRuntime(me)` (`src/runtime/run-me.ts`) is the
  concrete `.me`-backed implementation; `defaultAdapter` is an identity
  passthrough for static/no-runtime rendering.
- **Security allowlist** — expression roots are deny-by-default
  (`me/views/`, `me/public/`, `me/`, `me://`, `self:`, `kernel:`), widened via
  `allowedExprRoots` or disabled via `unsafeAllowAllExpressions` for trusted
  environments only.
- **`SpecBoundary`** (`src/runtime/SpecBoundary.tsx`) — the canonical
  "render one spec subtree and bridge every resolved node into the ambient
  `SelectionProvider`" component. Use this, don't reimplement it — a story
  reimplemented this logic locally (`SpecViewport` in
  `QuickStart.stories.tsx`) and drifted from a correctness fix landed here
  until it was deduplicated. Note its `registry` default is a **module-level
  constant**, not `{}` inline in the destructure — an inline default is a
  fresh object every render and silently defeats the `useMemo` that depends
  on it.
- **`mount()`** (`src/runtime/mount.ts`) — imperative `createRoot().render()`
  wrapper. Owns `RuntimeSelectionRoot`, which does the same resolve +
  register/unregister dance as `SpecBoundary` at the top level, including a
  `queueMicrotask`-deferred sweep that unregisters any node id from the
  previous render pass that didn't reappear in the new one (stale-node
  pruning — easy to get wrong by reaching for a same-pass
  `useLayoutEffect`, see the file's comments before touching it).
- **`mountApp()`** (`src/runtime/mountApp.tsx`) — highest-level app-shell
  bootstrap. Writes the app manifest into `.me` (`declareApp`), resolves
  `app.views[path]`, and branches: a plain `React.ComponentType` renders via
  `createRoot().render(<Theme><Layout><View/></Layout></Theme>)`; a
  `() => GuiSpecNode` factory must be tagged with `defineSpecView()` first —
  an *untagged* factory is not safely distinguishable from a component at
  runtime (calling an unknown function speculatively to inspect its return
  shape breaks Rules of Hooks for real components), so `mountApp()` throws a
  clear error rather than guessing.

## Semantic Inspector / devtools

- **`SelectionProvider` / `useSelection()` / `useOptionalSelection()`**
  (`src/runtime/selection.tsx`) — React context wrapping `selectionStore.ts`
  (the actual state: registered nodes, selection, inspector/grid toggles).
  `useSelection()` throws outside a provider; `useOptionalSelection()`
  returns `undefined` — **use the optional variant in any component that
  might render both inside devtools and in a plain consumer app that never
  mounts `SelectionProvider`** (footer launchers, anything in a default
  `mountApp()` shell). Getting this wrong crashes the whole surrounding
  layout, not just the inspector.
- **`registerNode`/`unregisterNode`** bail out on reference-equality of
  `spec.props`/`spec.provenance` (`isSameRecord` in `selectionStore.ts`) to
  avoid redundant store mutations. Hand-registered nodes (not spec-rendered —
  see `useRegisterGuiNode`) must pass **stable** object references for those
  fields — module-level constants, not fresh `{}` / `{...}` literals per
  render — or every render re-triggers a full re-registration.
- **`ThemeLauncher`** / **`DevToolsLauncher`** — sidebar footer bubbles,
  same bubble+popper shape, both must tolerate no `SelectionProvider`
  (`useOptionalSelection`). `ThemeLauncher` is the first instance of the
  **CollectionLauncher** pattern (`Projection(Space, Selection, Interaction,
  Surface)`, see project memory) — check for a second concrete instance
  before extracting a generic molecule for it.
- **Devtools are opt-in at the runtime level** — `mount(spec, target, { ...,
  devtools: { inspector: false, inspectorToggleVisible: true, adminView:
  false } })`. Runtime core should render fine with devtools entirely absent.

## Known landmines

- **`@react-three/fiber` → `react-reconciler@0.27.0` crashes any static
  importer under React 19.** `react-reconciler@0.27.0`'s peer deps only
  cover React 18; it touches
  `React.__SECRET_INTERNALS_DO_NOT_USE_OR_YOU_WILL_BE_FIRED` (renamed in
  React 19) **at module-evaluation time**, not render time — so merely
  importing the chain crashes before anything renders. `RubiksCube` is the
  current widget on this chain. It's isolated behind
  `src/gui/widgets/RubiksCube/RubiksCubeLazy.tsx` (`lazy()` + `Suspense`) —
  **import that wrapper, not `RubiksCube.tsx` directly, from any barrel**
  (`index.ts`, `widgets.ts`, or a future one). If you add another
  `@react-three/fiber`-based widget, give it the same lazy-wrapper treatment
  before wiring it into a root-level export — a plain static import will
  reintroduce this exact crash for every React-19 consumer of `this.gui`
  (this has already broken FullTrailer once).
- **UMD output needs a manual sync step.** `dist/this.gui.umd.js` is not
  automatically picked up by `netget`'s static `namespace-surface` HTML — it
  must be copied to two locations by hand after a build. Command is in
  `CLAUDE.md`, not repeated here; don't forget it after a UMD-affecting
  change or the deployed surface silently keeps running the old bundle.
- **Two consumption modes exist side by side in `netget`** —
  `namespace-surface/index.html` loads the vendored UMD bundle with global
  React 18 `<script>` tags (`window.__THIS_GUI_DISABLE_AUTOBOOT__` controls
  autoboot); `frontend_local` consumes the npm package via Vite +
  `file:` dependency (`react: ^18.3.1`). Don't assume a fix that works in one
  mode is visible in the other — they load genuinely different build
  artifacts.
- **`peerDependencies` claims React 18 or 19** (`^18.0.0 || ^19.0.0`), but
  the react-reconciler landmine above means that claim is only true for code
  paths that don't touch `RubiksCube`/`widgets.ts` eagerly. Keep that gap in
  mind before widening the peer range further or promising React 19 support
  in docs.

## CLI scaffold

`npx this.gui my-app` (`bin/cli.ts`, template in `npx/template/`) scaffolds a
minimal app: `app.ts` (an `AppDeclaration`), `main.tsx` (calls `mountApp`),
`views/Home.ts`. `README.md`'s "Scaffold a new app" section is the canonical
example — if you change the template, keep the README (and
`QuickStart.stories.tsx`, which mirrors the template's shape 1:1 on purpose)
in sync.

## When you finish something

Update this file if you changed the architecture it describes (a new entry
point, a new landmine, a pattern that got extracted or deduplicated). This
file is only useful if it stays accurate to what's actually true here, not to
what was true when it was written.
