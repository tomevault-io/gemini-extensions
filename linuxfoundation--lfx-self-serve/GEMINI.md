## Project Overview

LFX One is a Turborepo monorepo containing an Angular 20 SSR application with stable zoneless change detection and Express.js server.

## Working mode

You have full file-edit authority in this session — different from a Cowork session where you generate prompts for someone else to execute. For pre-edit hygiene checks (re-read files, type-check after multi-file changes, etc.) invoke the `/develop` skill.

**Lean on subagents.** Use the `Agent` tool for broad searches (`Explore`), independent parallel investigations (multiple Agent calls in one message), and context-heavy reads that would bloat the main thread. For the LFX post-commit audit, launch the `lfx-self-serve-code-reviewer` and `lfx-self-serve-learnings-reviewer` subagents in parallel (`subagent_type: lfx-self-serve-code-reviewer` / `subagent_type: lfx-self-serve-learnings-reviewer`, both with `run_in_background: true`) — their definitions in `.claude/agents/` carry the full review playbook. Default to delegating when the task is wide, parallel, or read-heavy.

## Domain language

Use these naturally — do not paraphrase:

- **PCC** — Project Control Center
- **ED** — Executive Director
- **Admin Mode** — privileged view variant for EDs and admins
- **Affiliation** — contributor's company/org link
- **L2** — second-level navigation pattern
- **Personas** — Contributor, Maintainer, ED, Board Member

When a feature affects multiple personas differently, flag it explicitly.

## Quick Start

**Prerequisites:** Node.js ≥22, Yarn 4.x (via corepack), Docker (for the local microservice stack).

For first-time setup (1Password env vars, microservice stack, etc.) invoke the `/setup` skill — it handles prerequisites, clone, install, env vars, and the dev server.

## Commands

All commands run from the repo root via Turborepo:

| Command             | Purpose                                             |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `yarn start`        | Angular dev server with hot reload (via Turbo)      |
| `yarn build`        | Production build (all packages)                     |
| `yarn lint`         | Lint + auto-fix across the monorepo                 |
| `yarn lint:check`   | Lint without auto-fix (CI mode)                     |
| `yarn check-types`  | TypeScript type-check only (no emit)                |
| `yarn format`       | Prettier write across the repo                      |
| `yarn format:check` | Prettier check (CI mode)                            |
| `yarn e2e`          | Playwright E2E suite (headless)                     |
| `yarn e2e:ui`       | Playwright in interactive UI mode                   |
| `yarn e2e:headed`   | Playwright headed, visible browser                  |
| `yarn commitlint`   | Validate commit message against Angular conventions |

> For manual commands, prefer `yarn` over `npx` — the repo pins Yarn 4.x through `packageManager`, so `npx` can resolve to the wrong binary. Repo-managed tooling (e.g. `.husky/pre-commit` invokes `npx lint-staged`) may still use `npx` where already configured.

### Reset / cleanup

```bash
yarn ng cache clean        # Angular CLI cache (uses the workspace-local ng)
yarn turbo clean           # Turborepo build cache (turbo is a local devDep)
rm -rf node_modules && yarn install   # nuclear
```

Hot reload silent? Likely `inotify` watcher limit — `sudo sysctl fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288`.

## Feature Modules

The application is organized into feature modules under `apps/lfx-one/src/app/modules/`:

| Module            | Description                                                                      |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **badges**        | LFX badges — view and manage credentialing badges earned across projects         |
| **committees**    | Committee management — view, create, and manage project committees               |
| **dashboards**    | Lens-based dashboards (Me, Foundation, Project, Org) and supporting drawers      |
| **documents**     | Document management — browse and manage project documents                        |
| **events**        | Events — browse LFX events and manage attendance                                 |
| **mailing-lists** | Mailing list management — subscribe, unsubscribe, and manage lists               |
| **meetings**      | Meeting scheduling — create, manage, and join meetings with calendar integration |
| **profile**       | User profile — profile management and account settings                           |
| **settings**      | Application settings — preferences and configuration                             |
| **surveys**       | Survey management — create surveys, collect responses, view NPS analytics        |
| **trainings**     | Training enrollments — view and manage training programs                         |
| **transactions**  | Transactions — view billing / purchase history                                   |
| **votes**         | Voting system — create polls, cast votes, and view results                       |

## Shared Package

The `@lfx-one/shared` package centralizes types, constants, enums, utilities, and form validators consumed by both the Angular app and the Express server. The path alias `@lfx-one/shared/*` resolves directly to `packages/shared/src/*` during development (hot-reloadable, no rebuild needed).

Common import patterns:

```typescript
import { formatDate, getRelativeDate, normalizeToUrl } from '@lfx-one/shared/utils';
import { User, AuthContext } from '@lfx-one/shared/interfaces';
import { futureDateTimeValidator } from '@lfx-one/shared/validators';
```

Utilities split into **generic** helpers (date/time, string, url, file, form, html, color) and **domain** helpers (meeting, poll, survey, vote, rsvp-calculator, project, committee, badge, rewards, insights, etc.). See [Package Architecture docs](docs/architecture/shared/package-architecture.md) for conventions, import patterns, and the full how-to for adding new items.

## Gotchas & Conventions

### Commits & PRs

- Follow Angular commit format: `type(scope): description`. Valid types: `feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, build, ci, revert` — **`chore` is not allowed** by commitlint.
- Commit header targets **≤72 characters** as a team style. Commitlint hard-fails at >100 (`@commitlint/config-angular` default; the repo doesn't override `header-max-length`). 73–100 will land but is a SHOULD_FIX in the PR-shape check.
- Always use `git commit --signoff -S` — both DCO sign-off (`--signoff`) and GPG signing (`-S`) are enforced by repo policy. See `.claude/rules/commit-workflow.md` for setup.
- Pre-commit runs `./check-headers.sh`, `npx lint-staged` (prettier + lint on staged files), then repo-wide `yarn format:check`, `yarn lint:check`, and `yarn check-types`. Only `lint-staged` is scoped to staged files — the rest run on the whole repo. You don't need to run `yarn format` manually; `lint-staged` already prettifies staged files. If a commit fails, fix the reported issue and retry.
- See `.claude/rules/commit-workflow.md` for PR title / sizing / JIRA details.

For missing sign-off recovery (single-commit amend, or older commits / cherry-picks / rebases), invoke the `/dco` skill.

### Source hygiene

- Every source file needs the MIT license header — `./check-headers.sh` validates and the pre-commit hook enforces.
- Never nest ternary expressions.
- Use `flex + flex-col + gap-*`, not `space-y-*`, for vertical stacking.
- All shared constants and interfaces live in `@lfx-one/shared` — no module-level consts or local `interface Foo {}` inside `apps/lfx-one/`.

### Architecture

- Always reference PrimeNG's component interface when defining types — all PrimeNG components are wrapped in LFX components for UI library independence.
- Use direct imports for standalone components (no barrel exports).
- Authentication is selective: public routes (`/meeting`, `/public/api`) bypass auth, protected routes require it. Auth0/Authelia via express-openid-connect; custom `/login` handler with URL validation. Prefer user bearer tokens over M2M tokens except in genuinely public endpoints — see `.claude/rules/development-rules.md` for the M2M usage rules.

### Dev server

- Don't restart the dev server on code changes — hot reload handles it. Check logs instead.

## Design source of truth

Design lives as HTML in a separate GitHub design repo, generated via Cowork sessions. **Not Figma.**

When implementing from a design:

1. Fetch the HTML from the design repo at the specified commit
2. Treat the markup as the visual spec — markup-faithful conversion expected
3. Convert to Angular component preserving structure
4. Add what HTML doesn't capture:
   - ARIA roles, focus management
   - Signals / `@Input` / state
   - Interactive states: hover, active, loading, error, empty
   - Responsive breakpoints
   - SSR safety (see `.claude/rules/ssr-safety.md`)

The HTML is the **visual** spec. Behavior needs explicit input.

For local auth issues (Authelia at `auth.k8s.orb.local`, broken cookies, client-secret fetch, session inspection), invoke the `/setup` skill.

## Source of truth, in order

1. **Code on disk** — re-view; don't trust history
2. **`apps/lfx-one/src/app/`** — the running app
3. **`packages/shared/`** — types and contracts shared with backend
4. **The design repo** — for visual spec
5. **This file + `.claude/rules/`** — for conventions

## Work cycle — post-commit and pre-PR reviews

> **CRITICAL — while the branch is pre-PR, post-commit reviews are mandatory.** After every commit on the local branch, launch the `lfx-self-serve-code-reviewer` AND `lfx-self-serve-learnings-reviewer` subagents in parallel via the Agent tool (`subagent_type: lfx-self-serve-code-reviewer` / `subagent_type: lfx-self-serve-learnings-reviewer`, both `run_in_background: true`) — then keep working while they run. Before opening a PR, every running review must return clean (or remaining findings explicitly documented as trade-offs), the **full-branch sweep** must run clean if the branch has more than one commit (`branch` arg), AND `/lfx-self-serve-pr-readiness` must clear every CRITICAL finding, with any SHOULD_FIX findings addressed or documented. The reviewers' time is the most expensive resource in this workflow — never skip, save for later, or assume changes are "small enough" to bypass.
>
> **Once the PR is open, do NOT invoke the reviewer pair on iteration commits.** CodeRabbit + Copilot auto-trigger on every push and own the audit surface from that point — stacking subagent audits on top adds latency without proportional signal. The pair is pre-PR insurance only. (For substantive new work pushed to an open PR, judgment applies; default is still to skip.)

### Post-commit (pre-PR phase, after every commit, parallel, asynchronous)

1. **Commit your work.** `git commit --signoff -S`. Do not wait for any prior review to finish.
2. **Immediately launch both reviewer subagents in parallel.** Issue two **Agent tool calls in a single message**:
   - **`lfx-self-serve-code-reviewer`** (`subagent_type: lfx-self-serve-code-reviewer`, `run_in_background: true`) — general code review on the diff (Step 2, native senior-reviewer disposition) + convention audit (Step 3) against the documented rule surface (`.claude/rules/`, the four `docs/reviews/` checklists, architecture docs) and upstream API contracts (Step 4). Renders a markdown review with General review / Upstream API / Repo conventions sections.
   - **`lfx-self-serve-learnings-reviewer`** (`subagent_type: lfx-self-serve-learnings-reviewer`, `run_in_background: true`) — empirical-pattern matching against `docs/reviews/knowledge-base/` (patterns sampled from past PR review comments on this repo). Renders a markdown review.

   **Why a required prompt:** the Agent tool needs a non-empty prompt to launch reliably, so we standardize on one canonical string per mode rather than leave it ambiguous. The string itself doesn't drive subagent behavior — each subagent's playbook only parses for `branch` and `extra:` and otherwise defaults to `git show HEAD`. The canonical strings are operator plumbing, not instructions to the model.

   **Post-commit mode prompt (exact, both subagents):** `Review the latest commit.` Append `extra: <focus>` on a new line only when there's a priority hint to add. Do NOT pass `branch` here.

3. **Keep working.** Start the next commit while the reviewers run. Do not block on them.
4. **When a review pair returns:** read both reports. Roll every Critical finding and every reasonable Important finding into the next commit (a separate `fix(review): address findings` commit is fine; squashing is not required — the history shows review-driven iteration).
5. **It's fine to keep committing while reviews are still running.** Each pair audits its own commit (not cumulative). If you've committed N+1 before the review for N returns, you'll get two separate reports — one per commit. Read both as they arrive and address findings in subsequent commits.

### Pre-PR (drain the queue, sweep cumulative state, then open)

When the work is "done" — no more code commits planned:

1. **Wait for every running review to complete.** Each pair audits one commit, so the pair invoked by every recent commit needs to have returned before you continue.
2. **If any returned pair flags Critical or reasonable Important:** add a fix commit, launch the reviewer pair again on the new state, wait. Loop until the pair returns clean (or remaining findings are explicitly documented in the PR description with a stated trade-off).
3. **Full-branch sweep — only if the branch has more than one commit.** Launch both reviewer subagents again in parallel via the Agent tool. The Agent `prompt` parameter for each subagent must include the `branch` keyword so the subagent audits the branch's diff against `origin/main` instead of just the latest commit:
   - **`lfx-self-serve-code-reviewer`**, prompt: **`branch\n\nReview the branch's diff against origin/main.`**
   - **`lfx-self-serve-learnings-reviewer`**, prompt: **`branch\n\nReview the branch's diff against origin/main.`**

   Per-commit reviews can miss cross-commit drift (an issue introduced in commit N and only made dangerous by commit N+2's changes wouldn't surface in either's individual review); the sweep catches it. Single-commit branches skip — already covered by the post-commit pair. Address any new findings, then re-run the sweep until clean.

4. **Run `/lfx-self-serve-pr-readiness`** against the target base branch. PR-shape sanity: branch name, JIRA, conventional commits, rebase, DCO + GPG per commit, diff size. Does NOT audit code (covered by the post-commit pair and the full-branch sweep). Address every Critical; address or document every SHOULD_FIX. Rerun until the verdict is `READY` or `READY WITH CHANGES` with explicit trade-offs.
5. **Run `/preflight`** for license / format / lint / build / protected-file mechanical checks.
6. **Only then push and open the PR.** (Reviewers run `/lfx-review-pr` against the open PR — that should not be your first standards check.)

### Post-PR iteration (responding to bot feedback on an open PR)

1. Wait for CodeRabbit + Copilot to comment after each push.
2. Triage every Critical and reasonable Important finding — verify each against current code (bots can quote stale paths or APIs).
3. Roll fixes into a single `fix(review): ...` commit. Reply + resolve each thread (`gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<N>/comments/<id>/replies` + the `resolveReviewThread` GraphQL mutation).
4. Push. Repeat until clean.

After `/compact`, re-invoke `/develop` or the relevant convention skill if continuing work that depends on it.

## What NOT to do

- ❌ Edit a file without re-reading it if 5+ turns have passed
- ❌ Replace components in place — for full component replacements use DELETE → CREATE (in-place edits remain fine for non-breaking changes; see `.claude/rules/component-organization.md`)
- ❌ Hard-code brand hex values (reference `lfxColors` scales)
- ❌ Reference browser-only APIs without `isPlatformBrowser`
- ❌ Mix module concerns in one change
- ❌ Open a PR without launching the post-commit reviewer pair (`lfx-self-serve-code-reviewer` + `lfx-self-serve-learnings-reviewer` subagents, in parallel via the Agent tool) after every pre-PR commit and draining the queue clean — both reviews are non-negotiable pre-PR
- ❌ Push the pre-PR queue before every running review has returned and every Critical finding is addressed (the queue must be drained at the PR boundary; once the PR is open, the bots become the audit surface and the pair is no longer invoked)
- ❌ Open a multi-commit PR without running the pre-PR full-branch sweep (`branch` arg) — per-commit reviews can miss cross-commit drift
- ❌ Open a PR without running `/lfx-self-serve-pr-readiness`, clearing every CRITICAL finding, and addressing or documenting every SHOULD_FIX — also non-negotiable
- ❌ Open a PR without DCO sign-off + GPG (`--signoff -S`)
- ❌ Commit and claim "done" before `yarn build` passes
- ❌ Re-introduce Figma references — design source is HTML/GitHub
- ❌ Edit `CLAUDE.md` or other `lfx-preflight` protected files without code-owner review
