# AGENTS.md — PromptSoul Agent Guide

PromptSoul is a local, self-hosted Next.js AI NPC prototype. The Node backend returns a short character reply plus an emotion label; the browser maps that emotion to a Live2D motion. Its motion workshop can also turn a natural-language prompt into a strictly constrained motion specification.

Read this file and `README.md` before changing the project. Preserve completed behavior instead of rebuilding it.

## Architecture

- `app/`, `components/`: Next.js App Router UI and Node Route Handlers.
- `assets/styles.css`, `assets/app.js`: responsive Live2D rendering, interaction, chat and emotion mapping. The legacy runtime is intentionally loaded by `components/legacy-runtime.tsx` to preserve the proven renderer.
- `npc.config.json`: public character copy, suggestions, persona and model attribution.
- `lib/server/provider-*`: OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions client and process-memory settings.
- `lib/server/chat-service.ts`: deterministic demo replies plus provider response parsing.
- `lib/server/motion-*`: safe prompt-motion compiler, authoring, generation and independent validation.
- `lib/server/model-*`: model import, safe ZIP handling, Hiyori setup and model analysis.
- `scripts/`: Node/TypeScript CLI entry points. The project has no Python dependency.

The chat API returns `{reply, emotion, mode}`. Allowed emotions are `happy`, `wink`, `nod`, `thinking`, `surprised`, `shy`, `shakehead`, and `neutral`.

The preferred generated group is always `PromptSoul`. `Action` is only a read/play compatibility fallback in the browser.

## API Key boundary

- The settings UI may accept an API Key, but it must submit it only to the same-origin local Node backend.
- Runtime keys live only in Node process memory. Never write them to React state longer than needed, browser storage, cookies, files, config, logs, responses or Git.
- Public provider/status endpoints may expose mode, source, model and API base, but never the key.
- Keep environment variables (`NPC_API_KEY` or `OPENAI_API_KEY`) as the recommended production configuration.
- Provider mutations must remain loopback-only, same-origin JSON requests. Do not expose this development server directly to the public internet.

## Typical model workflow

When the user asks to add motions to a model, work autonomously:

1. Locate a supplied ZIP/folder, or search `local-assets/` and the repository for `*.model3.json`. Ask only if no model can be found.
2. Import it with `npm run setup:model -- <zip-or-folder>`. This creates a working copy under `models/` and an ignored `model.config.json`. For the official Hiyori demo, first read the linked Live2D terms and run `npm run setup:demo -- --accept-license`.
3. Always run `npm run analyze:model` before designing motions for a new model.
4. Create or extend `motion-defs/<model-stem>.ts` using that model’s actual parameters. `motion-defs/hiyori_pro_t11.ts` is a format example, not a parameter template.
5. Run `npm run motions:generate`.
6. Fix issues until `npm run motions:validate` passes.
7. Run `npm run verify:browser` and visually inspect real rendered poses.
8. Start `npm run dev` and hand over <http://127.0.0.1:8765>.

## Repository layout

```text
app/                           UI and Node Route Handlers
components/                    React components
assets/                        Live2D browser runtime and CSS
lib/server/                    Server-only provider/chat/model/motion logic
scripts/                       TypeScript CLI entry points
tests-node/                    node:test suites
tools/verify_browser.sh        Chrome screenshot verification (Node server; no Python)
motion-defs/<model>.ts         Model-specific base motion definitions
motion-defs/generated/         Ignored validated AI specifications
npc.config.json                Public character/UI configuration
model.config.json              Ignored generated active-model pointer
local-assets/ , models/        Ignored licensed/generated model data
tmp-verify/                    Ignored browser screenshots
```

Everything under `models/` is generated. Never hand-edit `.motion3.json` or `model3.json`: edit the matching TypeScript definition and regenerate, or use the workshop, which persists a validated spec under `motion-defs/generated/`.

## Motion workshop safety boundary

- The browser sends only `{prompt}` to `/api/motions/generate`. The API Key, model path, raw parameter IDs, curves and raw provider response stay server-side.
- The provider sees opaque controls plus semantic display names and normalized values. The compiler maps them back to the current model profile.
- Treat provider output as data only. Never add `eval`, generated JavaScript/TypeScript, provider-selected paths, shell execution or subprocesses to authoring.
- Accept only the documented JSON schema. Reject unknown fields, duplicate controls, booleans/non-finite numbers, unknown controls, physics outputs, `PartOpacity`, values outside `[-1, 1]`, excessive curves/keyframes, invalid timing, and curves that do not start and finish at the base pose.
- The server owns `promptsoul_ai_<hash>` IDs and every output path. Generated files may only live in the active model’s `motion/` directory and may only be registered in `PromptSoul`.
- Keep the non-blocking generation lock, cross-process lock, atomic writes and model-revision recheck. Never silently delete another generated action at the per-model limit.
- Deletion is explicit and may target only a persisted public `promptsoul_ai_<12hex>` action in the active model. Validate its saved definition, runtime path and single `PromptSoul` registration under the same locks; never expose deletion for built-in PromptSoul actions or model-owned groups.
- An unsupported request returns `motion_not_feasible`; never force an arm, rotation or expression the model cannot express naturally.

## Model-independent design rules

- Never edit rigs or meshes in Cubism Editor; use only existing parameters.
- Stay within ranges observed in existing motions. `npm run analyze:model` prints them and the validator enforces them.
- Every curve must begin and end at the estimated base pose. Bases differ by model; for example Hiyori’s `MouthForm` rests at 1.
- Never animate physics output parameters directly. Move head/body inputs and let physics respond.
- Avoid `PartOpacity` switching; it creates unnatural pops.
- Register only into `PromptSoul`. Never replace or edit `Action`, `Idle`, `Tap` or any other original group.
- Use non-looping actions and conservative fade-in/out values around 0.2–0.5 s.
- If a hand/arm parameter cannot be understood from existing motions, skip the large gesture and express the intent with face/head/body.
- Models without source motions cannot provide reliable observed ranges; stay conservative and verify every result visually.
- Do not keep an unnatural motion. Explain the limitation and propose a feasible alternative.

## Hiyori-specific lessons (examples, not defaults)

- Smiling-arc eyes require `EyeOpen=0` together with `EyeSmile=1`.
- Hiyori’s resting `MouthForm` is 1; the surprised “o” shape is around -1.5.
- Yaw reads subtly; a visible head shake often needs roughly ±20.
- Idle motions park the arms around `ArmLA/RA=-10`, so action arm curves must preserve continuity.

Rediscover equivalent quirks from each new model’s own source motions. Never copy these values blindly.

## Browser debug hooks

| Query | Effect |
|---|---|
| `?play=PromptSoul:0` | Auto-play a motion after load |
| `&freeze=1.2` | Pin the motion pose at the specified second |
| `?uitest=1` | Run synthetic drag/zoom interaction checks |
| `?model=<path>` | Load an explicit model instead of `model.config.json` |

`tools/verify_browser.sh` already handles real-time playback and WebGL/SwiftShader flags. A base-pose-only screenshot means playback failed; inspect every output image for artifacts and unnatural fading.

## UI and license constraints

- Preserve responsive desktop/mobile behavior. Never introduce horizontal overflow.
- Keep text inputs at least 16px on mobile to avoid iOS auto-zoom and interactive targets at least 44×44px.
- Do not modify Hiyori’s character design.
- Screenshots and demos using Hiyori must visibly retain `Hiyori Momose ©Live2D` and the required Live2D attribution.
- `models/`, `local-assets/`, `model.config.json` and generated motion definitions are licensed/local artifacts and must never be committed.

## Definition of Done

Run all of the following after implementation:

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run motions:generate
npm run motions:validate
node --check assets/app.js
npm run build
git diff --check
```

For visual changes or motion work, also run `npm run verify:browser` or perform equivalent desktop and 390×844 browser checks. Confirm existing model groups are untouched and the only generated group is `PromptSoul`.
