# libsignal - Claude Code Configuration

## Important Rules

**ALWAYS use Makefile commands.** Never call scripts directly via `fvm dart run scripts/...`. The Makefile is the single entry point for all operations.

```bash
# Correct - pass arguments via ARGS variable
make test
make analyze ARGS="--fatal-infos"
make check-new-libsignal-version ARGS="--update"

# Wrong - never do this
fvm dart run scripts/check_updates.dart --update
make test test/keys/  # make interprets test/keys/ as target!
```

## Available Makefile Commands

### Setup
```bash
make setup                        # Full setup (FVM + Rust tools + protoc)
make setup-fvm                    # Install FVM + Flutter only
make setup-rust-tools             # Install Rust tools (cargo-audit, cargo-deny, frb_codegen)
make setup-frb-codegen            # Install the pinned flutter_rust_bridge_codegen
make setup-protoc                 # Install protoc (Protocol Buffers compiler)
make setup-web                    # Install web build tools (wasm-pack)
make setup-android                # Install Android build tools (cargo-ndk)
make setup-repo-protections       # Apply the GitHub repo rulesets (.github/rulesets/)
```

### Code Generation
```bash
make codegen                      # Generate Dart bindings from Rust code
```

**Note:** `make codegen` automatically creates a `.skip_libsignal_hook` marker file to prevent Build Hooks from downloading libraries during codegen. The marker is automatically removed after completion.

### Build
```bash
make build                              # Build for current platform (always release)
make build ARGS="--target <target>"     # Build for specific Rust target
make build-android                      # Build for Android (all ABIs)
make build-android ARGS="--target arm64-v8a"  # Build for specific Android ABI
make verify-android-alignment           # Check the built .so files are 16 KB-aligned
make build-web                          # Build WASM for web
```

`ARGS` reaches `build-android` **after** the `build` word, and that is
deliberate: cargo-ndk's own options (`--target arm64-v8a`) are recognised
anywhere on the line, cargo's are not, so this position takes both kinds and the
other one takes only cargo-ndk's.

⚠ **The 16 KB alignment of the Android libraries comes from `cargo-ndk`, not
from the NDK.** cargo-ndk passes `-Wl,-z,max-page-size=16384`; artefacts built
with r26 and r28 measure `p_align=0x4000` alike. Google Play has required it of
an app's bundled native libraries, for apps targeting Android 15 or later, since
1 November 2025 — so a cargo-ndk that stopped passing the flag would not break
anything here, it would make **consumers'** apps unpublishable. The version is
therefore pinned by hand in both Android jobs (`build-libsignal.yml`
and `test-reusable.yml`, together — a gate on a different tool than the release
is not a gate), and `make verify-android-alignment` measures the result rather
than trusting the pin. Both jobs run it.

### Web

```bash
make test-web                     # Browser suite: headless Chrome, real DOM APIs
make test-web CHROMEDRIVER=/path/to/chromedriver   # pin the driver (see below)
make test-web ARGS="--release"    # release profile, when the suite gets slow
make test-web ARGS="-- --nocapture"                # show console::log output
```

`make test-web` is the **only** check here that EXECUTES web code. `make test`
is the Dart VM and `make build-web` only compiles, so without it every
`cfg(target_arch = "wasm32")` branch in the crate is covered by nothing — and
those branches are exactly the ones nothing else can reach, because a wasm32
body is a *different implementation* of the same function rather than the same
code on another host.

⚠ **Pin chromedriver.** wasm-pack looks for one on `$PATH`, honours
`--chromedriver`, and otherwise DOWNLOADS THE LATEST — an unpinned network
fetch on every run. The `CHROMEDRIVER` **environment variable is not honoured**
— wasm-pack overwrites it with its own — hence the make variable, which becomes
the flag. CI resolves the runner image's preinstalled driver and fails closed if
there is none.

⚠ **That pins the DRIVER and not the BROWSER, and a green run is no evidence
otherwise.** With no `webdriver.json` and no `WASM_BINDGEN_TEST_WEBDRIVER_JSON`,
the test runner sends empty capabilities and ChromeDriver launches whatever
Chrome is installed. To pin it, point that variable at a file carrying
`{"goog:chromeOptions": {"binary": "<browser path>"}}`; the run then prints `Ok`
instead of `Not found` under "Try find webdriver.json". `Ok` alone only proves
the file was READ — check that a deliberately bad path fails, or the pin may be
parsed and dropped.

⚠ **A mismatched driver does not necessarily fail loudly**, so "it went green"
does not mean the driver matched the browser.

⚠ **`WASM_BINDGEN_TEST_TIMEOUT` is raised to 120 s in the Makefile.** The
browser runs every test on one JS thread, so a test that blocks it starves the
callbacks every concurrently-driven test is waiting on. The failure that
produces names whichever test was scheduled LAST rather than the slow one, so it
reads as a hang somewhere unrelated.

```bash
make run-example-web              # build-web, then run example/ in Chrome
make run-example-web ARGS="--web-port=5599"        # flags reach flutter run
```

⚠ **`make run-example-web` deletes `example/build/*/dart_build.stamp`, and that
step is load-bearing.** `flutter run` keys its build directory on the engine
revision, the entrypoint, the build mode and the output path — the target
platform is **not** in that key — so a debug run for macOS and a debug run for
Chrome share one `dart_build` stamp. Whichever ran first makes the other skip
the build hook outright (`Skipping target: dart_build`, visible under
`--verbose`), and `example/web/pkg/` is then never provisioned:
`RustLib.init()` fails on a 404 for `pkg/libsignal_frb.js`. The hook cannot
declare its way out of it — the skip happens above `hooks_runner`, where
nothing it declares is read. Consumers of the published package hit the same
thing; the README's *Known Limitations* names the escapes.

### Rust Quality
```bash
make rust-check                   # Check Rust code compiles
make rust-test                    # Crate unit tests (CI: Linux x86_64 leg)
make rust-clippy                  # Lint Rust code with clippy (warnings = errors)
make rust-clippy-web              # The same lint over the wasm32 half (GATE)
make rust-doc                     # Rustdoc GATE: intra-doc links, -D warnings
make rust-geiger                  # Unsafe-expression census (DIAGNOSTIC, not gated)
make rust-audit                   # Audit Rust dependencies for vulnerabilities
make rust-deny                    # Check advisories/licenses/sources (cargo-deny)
```

`make rust-test` is not just scaffolding: it carries the SSv2 fan-out
differential tests (`rust/src/ssv2_equivalence_tests.rs`, the only thing pinning
our byte layout to upstream's) and `release_profile_must_not_abort_on_panic`,
which reads `rust/Cargo.toml` to keep `panic = "abort"` out of the shipped
profile — abort skips unwinding, and unwinding is what runs every
zeroize-on-Drop in the crate.

### Fuzzing
```bash
make setup-fuzz                   # One-time: install nightly + cargo-fuzz
make fuzz-list                    # List available fuzz targets
make fuzz-seed                    # Generate the seed corpus (rust/fuzz/corpus/)
make fuzz ARGS="keys -- -max_total_time=60"  # Run a target
```

Fuzz targets live in `rust/fuzz/fuzz_targets/`; the seed generator is
`rust/fuzz/examples/gen_corpus.rs`. A `Fuzz` CI workflow runs a smoke pass on
`rust/**` PRs and a longer weekly pass. See `SECURITY.md` for the coverage table.

### Dart Quality
```bash
make test                                # Run all tests
make test ARGS="test/example_test.dart"  # Run specific test file
make coverage                            # Run tests with coverage report
make analyze                             # Run static analysis
make analyze ARGS="--fatal-infos"        # Strict analysis
make format                              # Format Dart code
make format-check                        # Check formatting without changes
make doc                                 # Generate documentation (FAILS on unresolved doc refs)
```

**`make doc` is a gate, not just a generator.** `dartdoc_options.yaml` promotes
`unresolved-doc-reference` to an error, so the target exits non-zero when a
docstring references a symbol dartdoc cannot resolve, and CI runs it. This
matters because `lib/src/rust/` is generated from the Rust docstrings in
`rust/src/api/`: a Rust intra-doc reference (``[`Type::method`]``) is copied
verbatim and reaches pub.dev as a dead link. Write references to the Dart
surface in **plain backticks with the Dart camelCase name**.

⚠ The gate cannot see a *wrong* name: plain backticks resolve nothing, so they
never warn. It proves every `[...]` reference points at a real symbol, not that
the prose names the right one.

`make rust-doc` is the counterpart for the Rust side — the intra-doc links in
the parts of `rust/src/` that stay in Rust, which `make doc` cannot see. It is
also a gate (`RUSTDOCFLAGS=-D warnings`), and CI runs it.

**`make rust-clippy` is host-only, and `make rust-clippy-web` is the other
half.** Not a thoroughness setting: a `cfg(target_arch = "wasm32")` body is a
different implementation of the same function, so the host pass reads none of
its lines while reporting green over the file that contains them. CI runs both.

⚠ The wasm32 leg uses `cd rust`, not `--manifest-path`. Cargo finds
`.cargo/config.toml` relative to the CWD, so invoking it from the repository
root drops the wasm32 rustflags and lints a configuration the crate never
builds under — measured as a different compile, not merely different paths in
the output.


`dartdoc_options.yaml` is `.pubignore`d on purpose — pub.dev runs dartdoc itself
and would honour the same promotion, which could break documentation generation
for an already-published version.

## Build System

This is a **plain Dart FFI package** — no `flutter: plugin:` section and no
platform scaffolding (`ios/`, `macos/`, `android/`, `linux/`, `windows/` dirs
do not exist). Native libraries are delivered via Dart **build hooks**
(`hook/build.dart`, using the `hooks`/`code_assets` packages).

### How It Works

1. **End users**: `hook/build.dart` downloads the precompiled binary for the
   target platform from the GitHub Release `libsignal_frb-<version>` (no Rust
   needed) and registers it as a code asset
2. **Developers**: build from source via `make build` (or `make build-web`); the
   hook then picks up the host-matching `rust/target/` build automatically (no
   marker needed). Cross-target builds (`make build-android`, `make build
   --target <triple>`, iOS) land in `rust/target/<triple>/` and are **not**
   picked up — those targets always download the released binary.
   `.skip_libsignal_hook` is only an
   internal escape the Makefile uses while wrapping pub-get/codegen/doc — when
   present the hook returns immediately and registers **no** asset
3. **CI**: `build-libsignal.yml` builds and uploads binaries when a
   `libsignal_frb-<version>` tag is pushed (stage 1 of the release flow)

### Precompiled Binaries

- Uploaded to a GitHub Release tagged `libsignal_frb-<version>` (must equal the
  `rust/Cargo.toml` crate version)
- SHA256 checksums are resolved before download; the hook fails closed if a
  trusted checksum cannot be obtained

### Deployment Targets

Source of truth is `.copier-answers.yml` (`ios_min_version`,
`macos_min_version`, `android_min_sdk`). `make check-targets` verifies (or with
`--update`/`--set` fixes) every copy: the CI build env vars
(`IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET`, `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET`, cargo-ndk
`--platform`), the example Xcode projects, and the README platform table.
`make build-android` reads the minSdk from it via
`scripts/get_android_min_sdk.dart`.

### Build Requirements (for source builds)

- **Rust toolchain** (rustup, cargo)
- **protoc** (Protocol Buffers compiler, required by libsignal's spqr dependency)
- **Android NDK** (for Android builds)
- **Xcode** (for iOS/macOS builds)
- **wasm-pack** (for Web/WASM builds): `cargo install wasm-pack`

### libsignal Version

The libsignal version is specified in `rust/Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
libsignal-protocol = { git = "https://github.com/signalapp/libsignal", tag = "v0.103.0" }
```

To check/update the version:
```bash
make check-new-libsignal-version              # Check for updates
make check-new-libsignal-version ARGS="--update"  # Update rust/Cargo.toml
make rust-update                              # Update Cargo.lock
make codegen                                  # Regenerate FRB bindings
make update-changelog ARGS="--version vX.Y.Z" # Update CHANGELOG with AI (requires an AI provider key)
```

> This updates the **libsignal dependency** only. It does **not** bump the
> `libsignal_frb` crate version — that happens at release time via
> `make release-frb` (see [Release Flow](#release-flow-two-stages)).

### AI-Powered Changelog

`make update-changelog` (and the CHANGELOG entry `make update-template` writes)
hand the release notes to an AI model. **Which** model is configuration, not
code: `AI_MODELS` holds an ordered, comma-separated list of `provider/model`
entries and the first one that has a key and answers wins.

**There is no default list.** With `AI_MODELS` unset nothing is called and the
entry is simply not written — a model that writes into this repository's
CHANGELOG is one somebody named, not one the template picked. Keys without a
list is a misconfiguration rather than an opt-out, so that case warns loudly
instead of going quiet.

```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=xxx make update-changelog ARGS="--version v1.0.0"

# Pick a different model, or a different order, without touching the code
AI_MODELS=google/gemini-3.5-flash-lite ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=… GEMINI_API_KEY=… \
  make update-changelog ARGS="--version v1.0.0"
```

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `AI_MODELS` | Ordered `provider/model` list, highest priority first. **Required** — there is no default; unset means no model is called. |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Key for `anthropic/…` entries ([console](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys)). |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Key for `google/…` entries ([AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)). |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | Key for `openrouter/…` entries ([keys](https://openrouter.ai/keys)). |
| `AI_EFFORT` | How hard the model is asked to think: `low`, `medium` (default), `high`, `xhigh`, `max`. Ignored by providers that have no such knob. |

An entry whose key is unset is skipped silently — that is how the list says
"use this if it is available". A malformed entry or an unknown provider is
warned about loudly, because it is a typo, not a choice.

Keys are read from the environment and go out in one request header each
(`x-api-key`, `x-goog-api-key`, `Authorization`). They are never put in a URL,
in process arguments, or in the prompt, and nothing logs them — the priority
line prints model ids and variable *names* only. Provider error bodies are
quoted into logs and pull-request output, so the key is stripped from those
before they are reported.

`openrouter` is an aggregator, so its model half is itself a `vendor/model`
pair — an entry reads `openrouter/anthropic/claude-opus-5`. It buys one key for
many models (swapping model costs neither code nor a new secret), at the price
of a third party on the path and a weaker schema guarantee: structured-output
support is per model **and** per backing provider, and `strict` is enforced
exactly by some and treated as guidance by others. A model that cannot do
structured outputs is rejected outright rather than silently downgraded.

The next entry is tried only when a model produced **no** answer: a network
failure, an auth/rate-limit/server status, a refusal, or a response cut off at
the token limit. Never on the *content* of an answer — switching providers
because an entry read poorly would make the CHANGELOG silently inconsistent.

In CI these are step-scoped: `AI_MODELS` as a repository/organization
**variable**, the keys as **secrets**. The pull request body names the model
that wrote the entry.

If no model answers, nothing is guessed: the entry is left unwritten, the run
says why, and the pull request is labelled `changelog-needed`.

## Development Workflow

### 1. Implement Rust API

Add your Rust functions in `rust/src/api/`:

```rust
// rust/src/api/greeting.rs
pub fn greet(name: String) -> String {
    format!("Hello, {}!", name)
}
```

Register the module in `rust/src/api/mod.rs`:

```rust
pub mod greeting;
```

### 2. Generate Dart Bindings

```bash
make codegen
```

This generates Dart code in `lib/src/rust/`.

### 3. Build Native Library

```bash
# For current platform
make build

# For specific target
make build ARGS="--target aarch64-apple-darwin"
```

### 4. Run Tests

```bash
make test
```

## Release Flow (two stages)

Releasing is **two independent stages**, each with its own command and tag. The
`libsignal_frb` native crate (`rust/Cargo.toml` version) and the `libsignal` Dart
package (`pubspec.yaml` version) are versioned and released separately.

```
libsignal dep-update PRs  ──►  merge to main  ──►  (accumulate, no binary)
                                                        │
   Stage 1: native crate ── make release-frb ARGS="--version X.Y.Z"
     bumps rust/Cargo.toml, stamps CHANGELOG frb Highlight, signs commit +
     tag `libsignal_frb-X.Y.Z`, pushes  ──►  build-libsignal.yml builds &
     publishes the native binaries (GitHub Release `libsignal_frb-X.Y.Z`)
                                                        │
   Stage 2: Dart package ── make release ARGS="--version X.Y.Z"
     verifies the stage-1 binary exists, dry-runs, bumps pubspec, finalizes
     CHANGELOG, signs commit + tag `vX.Y.Z`, pushes  ──►  publish.yml → pub.dev
     (the build hook downloads the stage-1 binary, which already exists)
```

**Key rules:**

- **Automated libsignal update PRs do NOT bump the `libsignal_frb` crate version
  and do NOT build binaries.** They only update the dependency + CHANGELOG.
  Dependency updates accumulate on `main` (CI still builds from source and tests
  them); no throwaway native binary is produced.
- **The native build is triggered by pushing a `libsignal_frb-<version>` tag**
  (created by `make release-frb`), not by pushing to `main`. The tag must equal
  the `rust/Cargo.toml` crate version (the workflow validates this).
- **Stage 1 must finish before stage 2** — the published Dart package's build
  hook downloads the precompiled `libsignal_frb-<crate>` binary, so it must
  already exist before you tag the pub.dev release.
- Skills: [`release-frb-crate`] (stage 1) and [`release-package`] (stage 2).

### Stage 1 — release the native crate

```bash
# From a clean, up-to-date main. You enter your signing passphrase during the
# command (commit + tag are signed; the terminal is inherited).
make release-frb ARGS="--version X.Y.Z"      # bump + commit + tag + push
make release-frb ARGS="--version X.Y.Z --no-push"   # local only
```

Choose `X.Y.Z` by SemVer of the FFI surface (see the `release-frb-crate` skill):
a non-empty `lib/src/rust/` codegen diff since the last frb release means the
wire signature moved (≥ minor; major if breaking).

### Stage 2 — release the Dart package

```bash
# After the stage-1 native build has finished. Same interactive signing flow.
make release ARGS="--version X.Y.Z"                # verify frb binary + dry-run +
                                                   # bump + finalize CHANGELOG
                                                   # + signed commit/tag/push
make release ARGS="--version X.Y.Z --no-push"      # local only
```

`make release` refuses to proceed until the stage-1 GitHub Release
`libsignal_frb-<rust/Cargo.toml version>` exists (the published build hook
downloads it) **and was built from this tree** — a release left by an earlier cut
carries the same version string with different bindings, and neither runtime
check catches that. `--skip-frb-check` skips both checks; pass it only if you
verified the binary by hand. It runs
`make publish-dry-run` (on the clean, pre-bump tree), bumps `pubspec.yaml`, then
finalizes the CHANGELOG (renames `[Unreleased]` → `[X.Y.Z] - <today>` in place —
no empty `[Unreleased]` is left behind — and rewrites the bottom `[Unreleased]:`
compare link to `vX.Y.Z...HEAD`), then signs a commit + tag `vX.Y.Z` and pushes —
`publish.yml` publishes to pub.dev. Choose `X.Y.Z` by SemVer of the **public Dart
API** (independent of the crate version).

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `AI_MODELS` | Ordered `provider/model` list, highest priority first. **Required** — there is no default; unset means no model is called. |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Key for `anthropic/…` entries ([console](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys)). |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Key for `google/…` entries ([AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)). |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | Key for `openrouter/…` entries ([keys](https://openrouter.ai/keys)). |
| `AI_EFFORT` | How hard the model is asked to think: `low`, `medium` (default), `high`, `xhigh`, `max`. Ignored by providers that have no such knob. |

An entry whose key is unset is skipped silently — that is how the list says
"use this if it is available". A malformed entry or an unknown provider is
warned about loudly, because it is a typo, not a choice.

Keys are read from the environment and go out in one request header each
(`x-api-key`, `x-goog-api-key`, `Authorization`). They are never put in a URL,
in process arguments, or in the prompt, and nothing logs them — the priority
line prints model ids and variable *names* only. Provider error bodies are
quoted into logs and pull-request output, so the key is stripped from those
before they are reported.

`openrouter` is an aggregator, so its model half is itself a `vendor/model`
pair — an entry reads `openrouter/anthropic/claude-opus-5`. It buys one key for
many models (swapping model costs neither code nor a new secret), at the price
of a third party on the path and a weaker schema guarantee: structured-output
support is per model **and** per backing provider, and `strict` is enforced
exactly by some and treated as guidance by others. A model that cannot do
structured outputs is rejected outright rather than silently downgraded.

The next entry is tried only when a model produced **no** answer: a network
failure, an auth/rate-limit/server status, a refusal, or a response cut off at
the token limit. Never on the *content* of an answer — switching providers
because an entry read poorly would make the CHANGELOG silently inconsistent.

In CI these are step-scoped: `AI_MODELS` as a repository/organization
**variable**, the keys as **secrets**. The pull request body names the model
that wrote the entry.

If no model answers, nothing is guessed: the entry is left unwritten, the run
says why, and the pull request is labelled `changelog-needed`.

### What the entry is judged against

`.github/agent-prompts/changelog-scope.md` holds this project's own statement of
what it binds and exposes, and the prompt classifies every upstream change
against it: anything that cannot be tied to something named there is invisible
to this package's users and must not be presented as a feature of it. The
template writes that file once and never overwrites it, so keeping it current is
this project's job — a stale list is how somebody else's release notes end up
described as our features.

**The `spqr` range is read by hand, and this is where the command lives.** The
sparse post-quantum ratchet runs inside the exposed Double Ratchet but is its
own repository, so a bump leaves exactly one trace in the libsignal compare the
prompt is given — a version number in a manifest. The model is sent a plain
completion with no tools, so it cannot go and look, and the scope file is
deliberately written so that it never asks it to. Whoever finishes the update
pull request does:

```bash
gh api repos/signalapp/SparsePostQuantumRatchet/compare/<old>...<new> \
  --jq '.files[] | "\(.status) +\(.additions)/-\(.deletions) \(.filename)"'
```

⚠ **Then diff the encoder, not just the file list.** On 1.5.3 → 1.6.0 the
serializer moved in the diff and was byte-identical all the same — the parsing
was regrouped so a message from an unsupported version could still be read. A
changed `serialize.rs` is not a changed wire format; compare the function at
both tags before writing either claim.

## Security Considerations

> **Important:** See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for full security policy and best practices.

### Supply Chain Security
- All native libraries are built from source in GitHub Actions
- SHA256 checksums verify downloaded libraries
- Pin to specific upstream releases
- Tools that shape or inspect the shipped binary are pinned by version, and by
  checksum where CI downloads them (`cargo-ndk`, `actionlint`). Neither pin is
  moved by Dependabot — it does not read `cargo install` or `curl` lines — so
  both move by hand

### Code Review Checklist
1. No hardcoded keys or secrets
2. Memory properly freed after use
3. Sensitive data zeroed before freeing
4. No timing side-channels

## FVM (Flutter Version Management)

This project uses FVM for consistent Flutter/Dart versions.

**Version:** Flutter 3.38.4 (Dart SDK 3.10.0)

FVM is automatically installed by `make setup`.

## Windows Users

On Windows, install `make` first:
- Chocolatey: `choco install make`
- Scoop: `scoop install make`
- Or use Git Bash / WSL

## Architecture

This project uses **Flutter Rust Bridge (FRB)** for Rust-Dart interoperability:

- **Rust layer** (`rust/src/api/`) wraps `libsignal-protocol` crate (pure Rust, not C FFI)
- **FRB codegen** generates Dart bindings in `lib/src/rust/`
- **FRB-generated Dart** is the final API (no additional Dart wrappers)

### Regenerating FRB Bindings

When modifying Rust code in `rust/src/api/`:

```bash
make codegen
```

This runs `flutter_rust_bridge_codegen generate` using `flutter_rust_bridge.yaml` config.

## Unimplemented Functionality

Some libsignal features are not yet implemented in this library:

### zkgroup (Zero-Knowledge Groups)
- Profile keys, credentials, group calls
- Server-side verification
- Not needed for basic Signal Protocol messaging

### Session Establishment
Session establishment via `SessionBuilder.processPreKeyBundle()` is fully implemented using FRB.
The in-memory store pattern avoids FFI callback complexity.

### SVR (Secure Value Recovery)
- Server-side functionality for PIN-based backups
- Not typically needed in client applications

## Stores Architecture

Stores are **required** for Signal Protocol operations due to Double Ratchet:
- Each message changes session state (ratchet advances)
- State must be persisted for correct encryption/decryption
- Without stores, repeated operations will fail or produce incorrect results

### Minimum Required Stores

| Operation | SessionStore | IdentityKeyStore | PreKeyStore | SignedPreKeyStore | KyberPreKeyStore |
|-----------|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Encrypt/Decrypt (existing session) | ✓ | ✓ | - | - | - |
| Process PreKey message (new session) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Group messaging | - | - | - | - | - |

**Note:** Group messaging uses `SenderKeyStore`.

### What Works WITHOUT Stores

- Key generation (`PrivateKey.generate()`, `IdentityKeyPair.generate()`)
- Signing and verification (`privateKey.sign()`, `identityKeyPair.sign()`,
  `publicKey.verify()`)
- Message parsing — `SignalMessage`, `PreKeySignalMessage`, `SenderKeyMessage`,
  `SenderKeyDistributionMessage`, `PlaintextContent`,
  `UnidentifiedSenderMessageContent` (construct *and* parse), and
  `sealedSenderV2ParseSentMessage`. Parsing validates structure only — it never
  authenticates; see SECURITY.md
- Certificate validation (`validateSenderCertificate()`)
- Creating `PreKeyBundle` from existing keys

### Sealed-Sender Envelope Operations (identity only, no session stores)

| Operation | Needs |
|-----------|-------|
| `sealedSenderEncryptFromUsmc` | identity key pair + `getIdentity` for the recipient |
| `sealedSenderDecryptToUsmc` | identity key pair + trust root (validates the sender certificate) |
| `sealedSenderMultiRecipientEncrypt` | identity key pair + `getIdentity` per destination + caller-supplied `SessionRecord` bytes |

None of these write to a store — they do no Double Ratchet work.

### Available Implementations

**In-memory stores** (in `lib/src/stores/in_memory/`) are for **testing only**:
- `InMemorySessionStore`
- `InMemoryIdentityKeyStore`
- `InMemoryPreKeyStore`
- `InMemorySignedPreKeyStore`
- `InMemoryKyberPreKeyStore`
- `InMemorySenderKeyStore`

For production, implement store interfaces with secure storage (SQLite, SecureStorage, etc.).

## Changelog Format

Each release is a `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` heading split into **audience-scoped**
sections. Keep this structure so entries stay consistent across releases.

```markdown
## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD

### For Users

#### ✨ Highlights

- **<headline>** — short description (mark breaking ones **(breaking)**)
- **libsignal vX.Y.Z** — ... (state "unchanged this release" if it didn't move)
- **libsignal_frb vX.Y.Z** — Rust FFI bindings

#### Added

- **<summary>** — new public API or capability a consumer can call

#### Changed (Breaking)

- **<summary>** — what broke. Include an **Action required:** note.

#### Changed

- **<summary>** — non-breaking behavior/API change

#### Security

- **<summary>** — security-relevant, user-observable change

#### Fixed

- **<summary>** — bug fix

#### Documentation

- **<summary>** — documentation a consumer reads (README, API docstrings, SECURITY.md)

### For Contributors

#### Added

- **<summary>** — internal tooling only (fuzzing, cargo-deny, scripts, …)

#### Changed

- **<summary>** — CI / lints / build config / template adoption
```

Rules:
- **`### For Users`** = anything a consumer of the published package can observe
  (public API, runtime behavior, the native binary, the build hook). A change is
  "For Users" even if it feels internal when a consumer sees it at build/run time
  (e.g. `overflow-checks` in the shipped binary).
- **`### For Contributors`** = changes that do NOT affect the published package's
  behavior (CI, dev tooling, lints, fuzzing, cargo-deny, build scripts, template
  adoption).
- Every bullet starts with a **bold summary** + em-dash, then the detail.
- Omit any section/subsection with no entries. Order subsections as shown
  (Highlights → Added → Changed (Breaking) → Changed → Security → Fixed →
  Documentation). The order is the list, not a subset of it: `update_changelog`
  anchors on the first `#### ` under `### For Users`, so a subsection filed out
  of order moves where later entries land.
- Released sections are immutable; edit the top pending version until release.

## Publishing Checklist

**Do not tag or bump versions by hand** — that bypasses the stage-1 native-binary
existence check, the CHANGELOG finalization, and the publish dry-run. Both
scripts require a clean tree and create a **signed** tag, which the
`Protect release tags` ruleset requires; an unsigned `git tag -a` is rejected.
Use the two-stage flow documented above (see
[Release Flow](#release-flow-two-stages)).

**What to have green before starting stage 1** — the release scripts run some of
these, not all of them:

```bash
make analyze ARGS="--fatal-infos"
make format-check
make test
make rust-test                  # incl. the release-profile panic guard
make rust-clippy
make rust-clippy-web            # blocking: the wasm32 half, which the above cannot see
make doc                        # blocking: unresolved doc references
make rust-doc                   # blocking: intra-doc links, host + wasm32
make build-web                  # mandatory after ANY rust/** change
make test-web                   # the crate's wasm32 tests, in a real browser
make rust-audit
make rust-deny
make verify-frb-pins
make verify-third-party-notices
make actionlint                 # workflows: static + shellcheck (CI runs it too)
make publish-dry-run            # exits 65 on ANY warning, a dirty tree included
```

**Push first and let CI go green, then tag.** `make release-frb` only *warns*
when local `main` is ahead of origin, and then pushes those commits together
with the release tag — so commits CI has never seen would reach origin at the
same moment the tag starts the native build. CI does compile and execute wasm on
every push and pull request (`Build WASM` and `Rust unit tests (browser)`, Linux
x86_64 leg), which is what makes "push first" a real gate rather than a
formality; it was not always so, and that is how crates 6.1.0 and 6.1.2 burned.

```bash
# Stage 1 — native crate (bumps rust/Cargo.toml, tags libsignal_frb-X.Y.Z):
make release-frb ARGS="--version X.Y.Z"
# …wait for build-libsignal.yml to publish the native binaries…

# Stage 2 — Dart package (verifies the stage-1 binary, dry-runs, bumps pubspec,
# finalizes CHANGELOG, tags vX.Y.Z → publish.yml publishes to pub.dev):
make release ARGS="--version X.Y.Z"
```
