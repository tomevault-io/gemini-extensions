- To check what's left in current sprint

**Example structure:**
```
Sprint 1.1 - Project Scaffold (30 SP)

Story 1.1.1 (8 SP): Create project structure
- [ ] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2
Status: Not Started

Story 1.1.2 (8 SP): Setup pyproject.toml
- [ ] Task 1
Status: Not Started
```

---

### **progress** - Completed Work

**Purpose:** History of what's been completed

**Read with:** `Read Serena memory: progress`

**Contains:**
- Completed phases and sprints
- Key milestones achieved
- Git commits summary
- Important decisions made

**Update frequency:** After each sprint completion

---

## 📋 Development Workflow

### Starting a Sprint

1. **Read current state:**
   ```
   Read Serena memory: todo
   Read Serena memory: progress
   ```

2. **Execute sprint:**
   - Work through all stories in order
   - No mid-sprint updates to user
   - Update task checkboxes in `todo` memory as you complete them
   - Make git commits with semantic versioning

3. **Complete sprint:**
   - Provide comprehensive summary to user
   - Update `progress` memory with sprint completion
   - Update `todo` memory with next sprint
   - Update CHANGELOG.md

### Making Changes

1. **Git commits:**
   ```
   Format: <type>(<scope>): <subject>
   Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore, perf

   Examples:
   feat(tools): add technical analysis tool with 4 operations
   fix(api): handle rate limit errors correctly
   docs: update ARCHITECTURE.md with testing strategy
   test(utils): add tests for token estimator
   ```

2. **Update CHANGELOG.md:**
   - Add entry under [Unreleased] section
   - Use semantic versioning
   - Group by Added/Changed/Fixed/Removed

3. **Update Serena memories:**
   - Check off tasks in `todo` as completed
   - Add completed work to `progress`
   - Update phase status when phase completes

### Code Quality Standards

**Must pass before commit:**
- ✅ Ruff linting: `ruff check --fix .`
- ✅ Ruff formatting: `ruff format .`
- ✅ PyTest: `pytest --cov=mcp_finnhub --cov-fail-under=80`

**Pre-commit hooks handle this automatically**

---

## 📊 Sprint Tracking

### Story Points

- **Small (3-5 SP):** Simple task, 1-2 hours
- **Medium (8-13 SP):** Moderate complexity, half day
- **Large (20-30 SP):** Complex task, 1-2 days

### Velocity Target

- **Minimum per sprint:** 90 story points
- **First sprint:** 30 SP (foundation work)
- **Regular sprints:** 90+ SP

### Sprint Completion

**DO NOT provide mid-sprint updates**

**At sprint end, provide:**
- Comprehensive summary of all completed stories
- Updated CHANGELOG.md
- Updated Serena `progress` memory
- Updated Serena `todo` memory with next sprint
- Git commits pushed

## 🚨 Important Principles

### No Mid-Sprint Updates
**DO NOT** provide status updates during a sprint. Only provide a comprehensive summary at sprint completion.

### Serena Memory Updates
Update `todo` memory task checkboxes as you work, but only update `progress` memory at sprint completion.

### Code Quality
All code must pass:
- Ruff linting (no errors)
- Ruff formatting (Black-compatible)
- PyTest (80% minimum coverage, 90% for tools/)

### Documentation
- Update CHANGELOG.md with every commit
- Use semantic versioning
- Keep Serena memories current

### Git Workflow
- Work on `dev` branch
- Semantic commit messages
- Commits after each story completion
