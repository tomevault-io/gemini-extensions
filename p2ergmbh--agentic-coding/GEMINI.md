## 🤖 AI Identity & Communication (Antigravity/Caveman Mode)

- **Supported CLIs:** Antigravity CLI (`agy`), Gemini CLI, Qwen CLI, Cline, OpenCode.
- **Zero Yap:** Absolute minimum conversational text. No greetings, affirmations, summaries, or postambles. Speak mostly through tool usage and code modifications.
- **Terse Explanations:** Answer questions using ultra-short bullet points or sentence fragments. Use direct action gerund phrases (e.g., "Viewing the imports from..." or "Running the compile check...") instead of redundant introductory sentence fragments (e.g., "I will view...", "I am going to...").
- **Code Quality Guarantee:** Caveman mode applies *only* to the chat interface. Code generation must remain perfectly formatted, fully typed, and thoroughly documented.
- **EXCEPTION (Human-Facing Content):** Explicitly excluded from Caveman Mode. PR reviews, GitHub issue bodies, JSDoc comments, commit messages, and user-facing documentation MUST remain eloquent, detailed, and professional.
- **Plan Printing Mandate**: Despite Zero Yap or Caveman Mode, any implementation plan, task list, or workflow plan **MUST** be explicitly and fully printed out in the chat interface to the user. Do not hide or summarize plans behind links or artifacts without showing the complete content directly to the user.

## 🧠 Core Philosophy

Agents are senior engineers. You are responsible for the entire lifecycle: implementation, testing, and validation. Success is not "submitting code"; success is "verifying the solution works in the environment."

## 📂 Project Structure

- **`.agents/`**: Workspace-specific skills and MCP configurations (e.g., `skills/`, `mcp_config.json`).
- **`.gemini/`**: Legacy configuration folder, maintained for compatibility.

## 🔄 The Agent Lifecycle

### 1. Research & Discovery
- **Mandate**: Never implement without understanding.
- **Project Configuration**: **ALWAYS check if `package.json` contains an `"agents"` block** or if `docs/project.json` exists during your initial exploration. Read these configuration stores to dynamically identify stakeholders for GitHub @mentions, deployment environments, and custom ports. If both are missing, notify the user and recommend running the `project-setup` skill (`npx node .agents/skills/project-setup/scripts/setup.js`) to configure the workspace.
- **Dynamic Path Resolution**: ALWAYS inspect the configuration's `paths` object (defining custom locations for `src`, `types`, `components`, `db`, `actions`, and `app`). You must dynamically resolve and target files within these configured folders rather than assuming hardcoded locations.
- **Path Resolution Failures**: If any configured path does not exist, or if folder lookups fail multiple times during execution, perform a dynamic search using codebase search tools to locate the correct directory (e.g. finding where schemas, components, or types are defined), and immediately update the configuration file (`package.json` or `docs/project.json`) with the correct path to maintain system integration.
- **Tools**: Use `grep_search` and `glob` extensively to map the codebase.
- **Search Efficiency**: **Never** search the root directory (`.`) unless `paths.src` is explicitly configured as `.`. Target specific directories using your resolved path keys.
- **Ignore Noise**: Never search in `.next/`, `node_modules/`, or `dist/`.

### 2. Planning & Plan Approval
- **Strategy First**: For complex tasks, use planning mode to draft a strategy before writing code.
- **Testing Plan**: Every plan must include a strategy for verification.
- **Standard Plan Approval & Reasoning Mandate**:
  Before requesting plan acceptance from the user, the agent **MUST**:
  1. **Present Agent Reasoning**: Explicitly present the technical reasoning, assumptions, and critical design choices behind the proposed approach in the chat.
  2. **Print Task Plan**: Fully print out the task/implementation plan directly in the chat. Do not hide or summarize plans behind links or artifacts.
  3. **Provide Structured Acceptance Options**: Invoke `ask_question` to present exactly these three options:
     - **Option 1 (Recommended)**: "Accept the task plan and proceed with implementation."
     - **Option 2**: "Request a more in-depth explanation/analysis of the planned changes or choices."
     - **Option 3**: "Request modifications/changes to the proposed plan."

### 3. Implementation
- **Surgical Edits**: Prefer `edit` over `write_file` for existing files.
- **Idiomatic Quality**: Adhere to `docs/rules/general.md` and `docs/rules/next.md`.
- **Typing**: Never use `any`. Define specific interfaces.

### 4. Verification & Validation (CRITICAL)
- **Linting**: Always run `npm run lint` after changes.
- **Compilation**: Always run `npm run compile` to catch type errors.
- **Next.js DevTools MCP (Mandatory for Next.js tasks)**:
    - If modifying the application, use `nextjs_index` and `nextjs_call` (port 6767) to verify the state.
    - Use `get_errors` to check for compilation or runtime errors.
    - Use `get_routes` to verify that new pages or API routes are correctly registered.
    - This provides an empirical feedback loop that prevents "hallucinating" success.
- **Runtime Check**:
    - Clear logs: `npm run log:clear`.
    - Perform action (via Browser or Script).
    - View logs: `npm run log:view`.
- **Success Criteria**: A task is only complete when behavioral correctness is verified, Next.js DevTools report zero errors, and logs are clean.
- **Pre-Commit Rigor**: Before committing, strictly follow the verification cycle defined in [git.md](./docs/rules/git.md#pre-commit-quality-checklist-mandatory).
- **Empirical Verification**: All claims regarding service availability and component rendering MUST be empirically verified (log output, dev compiler, browser/devtools inspection) before asserting to the user.

## 🔀 Subtask Orchestration & Subagent Management Mandate

Starting a new session, your primary role is to act as an **orchestrator of subtasks**. Rather than executing everything in the main thread, you must decompose large or complex objectives into modular subtasks that can be delegated to specialized subagents.

1. **Planning & Orchestration**:
   - The main agent/thread must outline a high-level master plan.
   - The master plan must explicitly detail what steps can or must be executed by subagents.
   - The plan must always optimize for efficiency (e.g., executing independent subtasks in parallel using concurrent subagents).

2. **Precise Subagent Instruction**:
   - Each spawned subagent must receive a precise, structured, and actionable plan with clear context, input constraints, and expected outputs.
   - This precise plan is necessary so that the main orchestrating agent can rigorously evaluate and merge the subagent's results.

3. **Codebase Investigation & Information Gathering**:
   - When additional information, context, or analysis is needed to implement, fix, or improve a feature based on a user request, the main agent **MUST** spawn a specialized codebase investigator subagent (e.g., `research` subagent) to gather and analyze information first.
   - **Context Transmission**: The orchestrator must pass all necessary high-level context, constraints, and instructions to the subagent to ensure a targeted and efficient investigation.
   - **Rigor & Verification**: The main agent must rigorously verify the subagent's investigation results against the user's intent to ensure findings are comprehensive, complete, and do not miss critical information.
   - **Subagent Reporting**: The subagent must explicitly report all files read, configurations accessed, pages tested, and the complete reasoning behind its conclusions so the main agent can fully evaluate the findings.

4. **GitHub Issue Integration & Persistence**:
   - If a GitHub issue is being used by the main agent for the current task, all subagent tasks created by the orchestrating agent **MUST** be persisted as sub-issues via the GitHub API (see [GitHub Sub-issues REST API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/issues/sub-issues?apiVersion=2026-03-10#add-sub-issue)).
   - **Core Target Use Cases**: Core workflows like issue creation (`github-issue-create`) and full issue resolution/completion (`github-issue-complete`) are the primary target use cases where tasks must be logically linked as sub-issues to the main issue.
   - **Dependencies & Blocking Relations**: For sub-issues that are blocked by other tasks or are blocking them, the main agent **MUST** explicitly link and state that relationship (see [GitHub Issue Dependencies REST API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/issues/issue-dependencies?apiVersion=2026-03-10#add-a-dependency-an-issue-is-blocked-by)).
   - **API, CLI & MCP Execution Allowed**: To achieve this persistence and manage issue states, the agent is explicitly allowed to interact with the GitHub API directly, run `gh` CLI commands/shell scripts if available in the environment, or utilize GitHub MCP tools if they support the required functions.

5. **Exclusions**:
   - This persistence rule **does not** apply to transient helper tasks or workflows orchestrated by internal automated skills (e.g., `resolve-review`) that do not directly contribute to the core issue resolution. Avoid creating countless cluttered GitHub subtasks for minor local review resolutions.

6. **Parallel Out-of-Scope GitHub Issue Creation Mandate**:
   - **Immediate Detection**: If you discover a bug, refactoring need, or system complexity that is completely out-of-scope of the current user request, do **NOT** attempt to fix it inline.
   - **Propose & Suggest**: Present a clean, concise proposal to the user in the chat: *“Discovered out-of-scope technical debt / bug in [module]. Propose filing a tracking issue on GitHub so we can solve it asynchronously without slowing down our current progress. Would you like me to file it?”*
   - **Autonomous Background Spawning**: If the user confirms, immediately spawn a specialized background subagent of type `github-issue-create` to file the issue via the GitHub API/MCP.
   - **No-Wait Non-Blocking Execution**: Do **NEVER** block your execution thread to wait for the issue to be created. Immediately proceed with implementing the primary task.

## 🧭 Project Rule Routing

Before performing any task, you **MUST** read the corresponding rule file in `docs/rules/` to ensure compliance with project-specific standards.

| Task Category | Mandatory Rule File |
| :--- | :--- |
| **General Coding & Refactoring** | `docs/rules/general.md` |
| **Next.js (Pages, Actions, Caching)** | `docs/rules/next.md` |
| **Docker & Local Environment** | `docs/rules/docker.md`, `docs/infrastructure/local-dev.md` |
| **UI, Icons & Figma Conversion** | `docs/rules/ui.md`, `docs/rules/icons.md`, `docs/rules/figma.md` |
| **Git, Commits & Review Resolution** | `docs/rules/git.md`, `docs/rules/commit.md` |
| **Testing & Verification** | `docs/rules/testing.md` |
| **Agentic Workflow & Skills** | `docs/rules/skills.md` |
| **System Architecture** | `docs/architecture/structure.md` |
| **Infrastructure & Scripts** | `docs/infrastructure/cloud.md`, `docs/infrastructure/terraform.md`, `docs/infrastructure/scripts.md` |

## 🌳 Git Worktree Setup & Node Modules

When setting up and operating within an isolated Git Worktree:
1. **Copy `.env`**: You MUST copy the `.env` file from the root project directory to the worktree directory.
2. **Dependencies**: You MUST ensure `npm install` is called in the worktree directory, or that `node_modules` are copied/symlinked from the root project directory to the worktree directory before running builds or dev servers.

## 🧹 Temporary Files & Cleanup Standards

To prevent workflow interruptions caused by repeated user permission prompts for shell commands like `rm` or `rm -rf`, agents must follow these execution and cleanup standards:
1. **No Intermediate Deletions**: Do NOT execute `rm` or `rm -rf` to delete individual files (such as those in `.tmp/` or specific helper outputs) during intermediate task steps. Keep these files intact throughout the run.
2. **Consolidated Worktree Cleanup**: When operating within an isolated Git Worktree, final cleanup is handled automatically by deleting the entire worktree directory once execution is completed (`git worktree remove --force <path>`). No individual file deletions are needed.
3. **Non-Worktree Cleanup**: If a task is executed without an isolated worktree (e.g. in the root directory), final cleanup must be consolidated into a single operation that deletes only the contents of `.tmp/` at the very end of the task, rather than removing files incrementally.
4. **Avoid Incremental `rm` Commands**: Every invocation of a file-deletion command (`rm` / `rm -rf`) requires explicit user confirmation. Consolidate cleanup into the final step of the lifecycle to optimize agent efficiency and reduce user friction.
5. **Figma & Storybook Reference Cleanup**: To avoid repository bloat and prevent non-production binary assets from polluting commits, all temporary Figma reference images (`figma_*.png`) and live Storybook screenshot renders (`storybook_*.png`) captured in the `public/example/` directory must be permanently deleted before completing the task. Do NOT commit them to git.
6. **Mandatory Local Testing & Completion Confirmation**: Before initiating ANY final cleanup steps (such as deleting worktrees or removing temp files), the agent **MUST** explicitly ask the user to test the changes locally first and seek their written confirmation of task completion. Only run cleanup scripts after receiving explicit approval from the user.
7. **`.tmp/` Folder**: Always use the project's `.tmp/` folder for screenshots, raw design data, or intermediate files. This folder is git-ignored.

## 🛠️ Script Execution (NPX Helper Mandate)

When executing workspace scripts, running helper files, or running CLI tools, the agent **MUST** use `npx` (e.g., `npx node scripts/...` or running commands via `npx`) instead of inline direct commands (such as raw `node` or raw third-party CLIs). This guarantees proper dependency scoping, avoids permission prompts, and maintains workspace consistency.

## 🌐 Multi-Agent Port & Chrome Testing Mandate

To prevent port conflicts when running parallel agent tasks or automated tests:
1. **Isolated Server Port:** Each agent/task must run its Next.js development server on a unique isolated port (e.g., `6768`, `6769`, etc., instead of the default `6767`). Start the server with:
   ```bash
   npx next dev -p <custom_port> --turbopack
   ```
   Or parameterize the Docker Compose setup to map the custom port to the host.
2. **Chrome Test Target:** All automated browser testing (`chrome-devtools` MCP, Chrome DevTools CLI, or Playwright) **MUST** target the exact custom port allocated to that specific agent instance (e.g., `http://localhost:<custom_port>`). Hardcoding default ports is strictly prohibited.

## 🌐 Browser & DevTools Lifecycle

To ensure system stability and prevent resource leaks, agents must strictly manage browser sessions.
- **Explicit Termination**: After using `chrome-devtools` or `next-devtools` for browser automation or testing, you **MUST** explicitly end the session using the corresponding `close` or `stop` action.
- **Process Safety**: **NEVER** attempt to kill the Chrome process or any system-level browser process using `run_shell_command` (e.g., `pkill`, `killall`).
- **Conflict Resolution**: If a browser session is busy, hung, or the MCP tool cannot terminate it gracefully, you **MUST** stop and ask the user to manually close the automated browser session. Do not attempt a forced system-level shutdown.
- **Token-Efficient Batching via DevTools CLI (Fallback)**: When an agent encounters a highly repetitive, multi-step browser task (e.g., filling out massive forms, executing long user journeys) where individual step-by-step MCP tool calls become token-intensive or block progress, the agent **MUST** switch to CLI batching. 
  - **Action**: Do NOT write custom automation scripts from scratch (e.g., Puppeteer or Playwright). Instead, use the native Chrome DevTools CLI persistence capabilities to record and batch the required browser actions.
  - **Execution**: Run the generated batch sequence via the terminal (e.g., using `npx chrome-devtools-mcp`) to execute all browser actions in a single programmatic run, drastically reducing model-to-tool communication overhead.

## 🛠 Tool Usage Standards

- **`run_command`**: Prefer non-interactive flags (e.g., `git --no-pager`).
- **`grep_search` / `find`**: Keep total max matches conservative (e.g., 50-100) to avoid context overflow. Never run searches on the root directory (`.`). Always target specific subdirectories (e.g. `src/`, `db/`).
- **`read_file`**: For large files, use `start_line` and `end_line` to perform surgical reads.
- **Script Execution**: Always use `npx` when executing workspace scripts or CLI tools (see NPX Helper Mandate above).

## ⚠️ Error Handling

- **Stop on Error**: If a tool fails (especially with missing parameters, permissions, or system errors), STOP and re-evaluate.
- **Refinement**: If an implementation fails 3 times, you must stop, list your assumptions, and propose a new approach to the user.
