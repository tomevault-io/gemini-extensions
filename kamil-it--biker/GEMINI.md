# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Agent Policy

**Before implementing any multi-step task**, always call `mcp__ruflo__hooks_pre-task` with the task ID and description. It returns agent role suggestions — spawn those agents via `mcp__ruflo__agent_spawn` before writing code. Example flow:

1. `mcp__ruflo__hooks_pre-task` — get agent suggestions for this task
2. `mcp__ruflo__agent_spawn` — spawn one agent per suggested role (e.g. `backend-impl`, `tester`)
3. `mcp__ruflo__task_create` — register the task
4. Implement, then `mcp__ruflo__task_complete` when done

## ECC Skill Routing

Structured workflows for common task types. Use these skills in `.claude/skills/` when starting code changes.

**See `.claude/ECC_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` for complete documentation and how to download all 449 ECC skills.**

| Task | Skill | Use When |
|------|-------|----------|
| **Implement new endpoint** | `sparc-code` | Adding POST /v1/bike/* or /v1/equipment/* endpoint |
| **Add tests** | `sparc-tester` | After implementation, before PR; writes smoke tests in backend/scripts/test_search.py |
| **Security audit** | `sparc-security-review` | New endpoint, new finder module, or API integration (validates input, prevents prompt injection, checks error handling) |
| **Capture pattern** | `memory-persist` | After successful feature completion; saves reusable pattern to Obsidian vault for future tasks |

**Example workflow:**
```
User: "Add Decathlon offer endpoint"

1. Invoke /sparc:code
   → Specification → Pseudocode → Implementation → Testing phases
   → Creates app/bike_offer_decathlon_finder.py + POST /v1/bike/decathlon route

2. Invoke /sparc:tester
   → Adds test to backend/scripts/test_search.py
   → Verifies smoke test passes, cache works, error handling

3. Invoke /sparc:security-review
   → Validates input, prevents prompt injection, checks error responses
   → Runs pen-tests with cURL examples

4. Invoke /memory:persist
   → Saves "Offer finder pattern: single web_search + cache + fallback" to Obsidian
   → Next time: search vault → reuse template → save 1.5 hours

5. Create PR for review
```

## Memory & Persistence

Durable, cross-session memory for this project lives in a single human-readable Obsidian vault — **not** ruflo's `memory_*` / AgentDB stores. The vault is at `obsidian/bike-memory/` (gitignored, including its bearer token) with notes under a `memory/` folder. It is served by the `obsidian` MCP server (the "MCP Connector" plugin, `http://127.0.0.1:27200/mcp`) using local Transformers.js embeddings (`Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`, no API key).

**To recall:** `mcp__obsidian__search_vault_smart` (semantic) or `search_vault_simple` (keyword).
**To store:** `mcp__obsidian__create_vault_file` (path like `memory/<topic>.md`, with YAML frontmatter + tags).
**To read/update:** `get_vault_file`, `append_to_vault_file`, `patch_vault_file`, `list_vault_files`.

Prefer these over `mcp__ruflo__memory_store` / `memory_search` — the vault is the source of truth so everything stays in one syncable, greppable, Obsidian-browsable store. **Requires the Obsidian app running** with the MCP Connector plugin enabled; if the `obsidian` server is unavailable, say so rather than silently falling back to the ruflo DB.

## Backlog

Tasks are tracked in `/backlog/`. Naming convention:

- `TODO_<ID>_<TASK_NAME>.md` — task not yet started
- `DONE_<ID>_<TASK_NAME>.md` — completed task (rename the file, don't delete it)
- `TODO_ISSUE_<ID>_<NAME>.md` — reported bug/issue, not yet fixed
- `DONE_ISSUE_<ID>_<NAME>.md` — fixed issue (rename the file, don't delete it)

Layout:

```
backlog/            active work — TODO_* files live here
backlog/done/       merged tasks (DONE_*)
backlog/blocked/    implemented but unverifiable — still TODO_*
```

`backlog/` itself holds **only what is actionable now**. Scan it for the next task; the two subfolders are archives, not queues.

When picking up a task: read its file, implement, then rename `TODO_` → `DONE_` **and move it to `backlog/done/`**.
When creating a new task: ask clarifying questions first, then write the file.

### Completed tasks — `backlog/done/`

A task moves here when **its PR has merged to `main`**. Merged is the bar: finished code with an open PR is not done and stays in `backlog/`. Keep the files — they are the record of what was built and why. Update `backlog/done/README.md` when adding one.

### Blocked tasks — `backlog/blocked/`

`backlog/blocked/` holds tasks that are **implemented but cannot be verified** because of an external dependency nobody on the project can satisfy right now (a credential, an account approval, a third-party verification). They keep their `TODO_` prefix — blocked is not done.

- **Do not pick these up in the normal backlog rotation.** Skip the folder when scanning for the next task.
- Move a task back to `backlog/` only once its blocker is genuinely resolved — not merely because its code looks finished.
- `backlog/blocked/README.md` lists what is blocked, on what, what evidence exists, and the known defects to fix on first real use. Update it whenever a task moves in or out.

A task belongs here when its feature **cannot be demonstrated**, not when it is merely hard or unfinished. If the work simply has not been done, it stays a normal `TODO_`.

## Development Rules

**New backend endpoint** → add a smoke test for it in `backend/scripts/test_search.py`. This is the single file for all smoke tests. Each test must call the endpoint against a running local server and assert HTTP 200.

**New backend endpoint using the Anthropic API** → must use the SQLite cache in `app/cache.py`. Pattern:
```python
_fields = {"key_field": req.key_field}  # only fields that uniquely identify the response
cached = get_cached("/v1/your/route", _fields, YourResponseModel)
if cached is not None:
    return cached
# ... existing logic ...
set_cached("/v1/your/route", _fields, result)
return result
```
Only call `set_cached` on the happy path — never cache error/fallback responses.
For endpoints returning offers or reviews, only cache when the result is non-empty:
- Offers: `if result.offers: set_cached(...)`
- Reviews: `if result.ref: set_cached(...)`
- Search/details: always cache (empty is a valid result)
This mirrors the pattern used by `/v1/bike/used`.

## Documentation Update Policy

After **every code change**, review and update the relevant documentation before considering the task done:

| What changed | Files to review & update |
|---|---|
| Any change | `CLAUDE.md` · `README.md` |
| Backend (`/backend/**`) | `backend/README.md` · `README.md` · `CLAUDE.md` |
| Frontend (`/frontend/**`) | `frontend/README.md` · `README.md` · `CLAUDE.md` |

Update only the sections that are actually affected — do not rewrite docs that remain accurate.

**`backend/README.md` must always contain an `## Endpoints` section** with every endpoint listed, including:
- A raw HTTP request example (`POST http://localhost:8000/...` with `Content-Type` and JSON body)
- A **Flow** list of every outbound HTTP call made (exact URL, service name, and how many times / in what order)

## Project Overview

Monorepo with separate backend and frontend applications:
- `/backend` — Python REST API (FastAPI)
- `/frontend` — React + TypeScript + Tailwind v4 SPA (Vite)

## Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv .venv && .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
copy .env.example .env   # then edit .env with your real ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
python scripts/migrate_bike_details.py   # REQUIRED on an existing cache.db (see below)
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

**The migration is a hard prerequisite on any pre-existing `cache.db`.** `init_db()`'s `create_all()` never `ALTER`s an existing table, so an older `bike_results` lacks `search_id`/`position`; `repository.save_search` then raises `OperationalError` on every write, and the surrounding `except Exception` keeps the request alive. Result: nothing is cached, the DB-first search branch never hits, and every search runs the full AI pipeline. `repository` singles out this failure (`no such column`/`no such table`) and logs it at **ERROR** naming the remedy rather than letting it blend into routine cache warnings — that line means the migration has not been run here, though it detects rather than fixes. A database migrated by an *intermediate* build has its lowercase brand names repaired automatically: the migration's casing self-heal runs on **every** invocation, so a plain re-run is enough (no `--force`), provided `search_cache` has not been dropped. See `backend/app/DB_MIGRATION.md`.

```bash
# In a second terminal — smoke test the endpoint:
python scripts/test_search.py
```

- **API docs**: http://localhost:8000/docs (auto-generated OpenAPI UI)
- **Python version**: 3.14

## Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev       # dev server on http://localhost:5173
```

```bash
npm run build     # production build → dist/
npm run preview   # serve production build locally
```

- **Dev server**: http://localhost:5173 — requires the backend to be running on port 8000 (Vite proxies `/v1/*` → `http://localhost:8000`)
- **Node version**: v24 / npm 11

## Parallel Development (Worktrees)

Work on multiple features simultaneously — each in its own directory, its own branch, without stashing.

```
C:\Users\kamil_wolny\Projects\
├── biker\             ← main branch (always here)
└── biker-wt\
    ├── feature-xyz\   ← feature/xyz branch
    └── fix-abc\       ← fix/abc branch
```

**Create a new worktree:** `/new-worktree feature/my-feature`
**Check what's running:** `/worktree-status`
**Remove when done:** `git worktree remove C:\Users\kamil_wolny\Projects\biker-wt\feature-my-feature`

Each worktree shares `node_modules` and `.venv` via Junction symlinks (created automatically by `/new-worktree`). If your branch adds new packages, break the junction and run install fresh — the command output explains how.

**Port convention** (for running two worktrees simultaneously):

| Worktree | Backend | Frontend |
|----------|---------|----------|
| `biker\` (main) | 8000 | 5173 |
| first worktree | 8001 | 5174 |
| second worktree | 8002 | 5175 |

## Architecture

### Backend (`/backend`)

| Layer | File | Responsibility |
|-------|------|----------------|
| Entry point | `app/main.py` | FastAPI app, routes, request logging |
| Schemas | `app/schemas.py` | Pydantic models: `SearchRequest`, `CategoryResult`, `SearchResponse`, `BikeResult`, `BikeSearchResponse`, `CachedSearchResponse`, `BikeDetailsRequest`, `BikeDetailsResponse`, `BikeCategory`, `BikeSubcategory`, `ComponentElement`, `SpecItem`, `BikeReviewRequest`, `BikeReviewResponse`, `BikeOffer`, `BikeOfferRequest`, `BikeOfferResponse`, `UsedBikeRequest`, `UsedBikeResponse`, `EquipmentDetailsRequest`, `EquipmentDetailsResponse`, `EquipmentReviewRequest`, `EquipmentReviewResponse` |
| Generic cache | `app/cache.py` | SQLite `cache` table: generic per-endpoint response cache keyed by endpoint + normalised request (`get_cached`/`set_cached`) |
| Offer price lookup | `app/store.py` | Down to ~54 lines: `find_offer_prices(brand, model)` — every parseable price across the four offer endpoints' cached responses in the raw `cache` table, joined on `cache.py`'s `_normalise({company, model})`; backs the `price_max` gate on the DB-first branch of `POST /v1/bike/search`. It stays here because `bike_offers` is empty and nothing populates it. `init_store()` now **creates nothing** — it owns no tables any more and is kept purely as the app's startup hook (it only logs). **Search and details both moved to `app/repository.py`** (TODO-019) |
| ORM data access | `app/repository.py` · `app/models.py` | SQLAlchemy layer over `bikes`/`bike_details`/`bike_detail_photos` (+ unused `bike_results`/`accessories`/`bike_offers`). **Live for bike details**: `save_bike_details`/`get_bike_details` are the details cache (30 d TTL from `updated_at + ttl_seconds`; the response echoes the **caller's** casing, and photos are rows ordered by `display_order` rather than a JSON array). `bikes` carries normalised lookup columns `brand_norm`/`model_norm` (`models.norm()` = Python `.strip().lower()`, `UNIQUE(brand_norm, model_norm)`, kept in lockstep by a `@validates("brand", "model")` handler — fires on construction **and** later assignment, but **not** on a bulk `query().update()`) that every identity lookup matches exactly, while `brand`/`model` keep their real casing because the row is shared with search results — they are the **single source of display casing**, so a stored value equal to its own normalised form is treated as a placeholder (the old details blob keyed on `strip().lower()`) and upgraded by the first caller supplying real casing; the rule is monotonic, so lowercase never overwrites real casing and it cannot oscillate. **Normalise in Python, never via SQL `func.lower()`** — SQLite's `lower()` is ASCII-only, so uppercase non-ASCII (`RIESE & MÜLLER`, `Škoda`) misses the lookup and mints a duplicate identity; canonical `Riese & Müller` is unaffected, which is what makes it easy to miss. `models.configure_db(path)` repoints the ORM at another SQLite file, falling back to `models.DEFAULT_DB_PATH` (used by the migration script and the parity test). **Also live for search**: `save_search`/`get_search_by_query`/`find_bikes_by_brand`/`find_bike_by_brand_model` read and write `searches` (`query` = `norm()`'d enriched query, `UNIQUE`, 24 h TTL from `created_at + ttl_seconds`) + `bike_results` (`search_id` FK `ON DELETE CASCADE`, plus **`position`** preserving the score-weighted rank the old JSON blob carried implicitly — reads `ORDER BY position`). `find_bikes_by_brand` matches `brand_norm` **exactly**, not `ilike` substring — this matches the shipped `store.py` behaviour it replaced. See `backend/app/DB_MIGRATION.md` |
| Price parsing | `app/price_parse.py` | `parse_price(raw) -> float \| None` — turns a scraped price string (`'17 386,85 zł'`, `'1199.99 zł'`, `'Price on request'`) into a float; handles `zł`/`PLN`/`zl` tokens, regular/NBSP/narrow-NBSP thousands separators and both `,`/`.` decimals. Returns `None` (never raises) when no number is present, which the `price_max` gate treats leniently |
| Categories | `app/categories.py` | 11 bike category registry; loads prompt files at startup |
| Equipment categories | `app/equipment_categories.py` | 4 equipment category registry (helmets, lights, locks, apparel); loads prompt files at startup; keyword-based `resolve_category()` inference |
| Prompts | `app/prompts/*.md` | Per-category scoring prompts + `bike_search_{slug}.md` per-category bike-finding prompts + `bike_details_{slug}.md` per-category component search prompts (8 categories) + `bike_details.md` JSON format reference + `equipment_details_{slug}.md` (4) + `equipment_description.md` / `equipment_photos.md` / `equipment_review.md` |
| Scorer | `app/anthropic_scorer.py` | Calls Claude Haiku per category, strips code fences, parses JSON |
| Bike finder | `app/bike_finder.py` | Filters top categories, allocates 5 bikes by score weight, finds real bikes via Claude in parallel |
| Details finder | `app/bike_details_finder.py` | Loops through 8 component categories (Frame → Accessories), runs one focused `web_search` call per category, aggregates results via the shared `extract_json()`; logs per-iteration and total token usage |
| JSON extraction | `app/json_extract.py` | Shared `extract_json()` — lifts the first parseable fenced block or balanced `{...}`/`[...]` out of prose. Used by every finder whose prompt demands raw JSON; the model narrates before the object often enough that a strict parser silently loses whole categories/offers |
| Description finder | `app/bike_description_finder.py` | Single `web_search` call with prompt caching to generate a 4–5 sentence plain-text bike overview; runs in parallel with details finder |
| Review finder | `app/bike_review_finder.py` | Single `web_search` call across curated sources (tier list and weights in `backlog/TODO_018_REVIEW_SOURCE_DISAGREEMENT_AND_REF_ORDER.md`); synthesises score 0–10, explanation, source URLs, plus a per-source score array from which it computes a weighted aggregate `rating` (0–10) and `sources_used` count (pro/numeric 3×, pro/qualitative 2×, community 1×; non-zero rating requires ≥1 pro source). When the highest and lowest per-source score spread by more than `DISAGREEMENT_THRESHOLD` (3.0), `rating` anchors to the pro/numeric mean (falling back to pro/qualitative) instead of the weighted mean, and a disagreement sentence is appended to `explanation`; `sources_used` is unaffected. `ref` is returned sorted Tier 1 → Tier 2 → Tier 3. Tolerates the model narrating before the JSON via a balanced-brace scan over all text blocks, with a no-tool prefilled repair call as a last resort |
| Offer finder | `app/bike_offer_finder.py` | Single `web_search` call to find 1 current offer on allegro.pl |
| Used bikes finder | `app/bike_used_finder.py` | Single `web_search` call to find up to 5 used listings on olx.pl with cascade fallback; then Playwright scrapes photos via `olx_image_fetcher.py` |
| OLX image fetcher | `app/olx_image_fetcher.py` | Playwright (headless=False) scrapes up to 4 `<img>` URLs from each OLX listing URL using `*.apollo.olxcdn.com` regex |
| Ceneo finder | `app/bike_offer_ceneo_finder.py` | Single `web_search` call to find 1 current offer on ceneo.pl |
| Decathlon finder | `app/bike_offer_decathlon_finder.py` | Single `web_search` call to find 1 current offer on decathlon.pl |
| Photos finder | `app/bike_photos_finder.py` | Two-step: (1) Claude `web_search` to find manufacturer product page URL, (2) Playwright (`headless=False`) scrapes up to 8 product `<img>` URLs from rendered page; runs in parallel with details and description finders |
| Equipment details finder | `app/equipment_details_finder.py` | Resolves the equipment category (given or inferred), runs one focused component-search call with that category's `equipment_details_{slug}.md` prompt, returns the bike-style component tree (web_search behind a `TODO` flag, mirroring the bike details finder) |
| Equipment description finder | `app/equipment_description_finder.py` | Single `web_search` call with prompt caching for a 4–5 sentence equipment overview |
| Equipment photos finder | `app/equipment_photos_finder.py` | Two-step manufacturer-page → Playwright scrape (mirrors `bike_photos_finder.py`) |
| Equipment review finder | `app/equipment_review_finder.py` | Single `web_search` call → score 0–10, explanation, one source URL (review/forum only, never offers) |
| Test scripts | `scripts/test_search.py` · `scripts/test_details.py` · `scripts/test_review.py` · `scripts/test_offer.py` · `scripts/test_equipment.py` · `scripts/test_equipment_review.py` · `scripts/test_details_parity.py` | Smoke tests for each endpoint (`test_equipment_review.py` is a focused regression for the equipment-review JSON extraction; `test_details_parity.py` is a pytest asserting the ORM details read path returns a field-for-field identical `BikeDetailsResponse` to the old blob path — casing echo, `components` tree, photo order, staleness — run against a scratchpad copy of `cache.db`) |
| DB migration script | `scripts/migrate_bike_details.py` | One-off, **idempotent** backfill of the legacy `bike_details_cache` blob rows into `bikes` + `bike_details` + `bike_detail_photos`, preserving each row's age (`time_stored` → `updated_at`, `ttl` → `ttl_seconds`) and photo order (array index → `display_order`); also adds + backfills `brand_norm`/`model_norm` on every pre-existing `bikes` row, merges rows sharing a normalised identity, creates the `uq_bike_brand_model_norm` index, and clears test-script leftovers. Placeholder (all-lowercase) casing on `bikes` is repaired on **every** invocation via `_repair_placeholder_casing()` — reported as `casing_repaired` / `placeholders_left`, and impossible once `search_cache` is dropped, since that blob is the only surviving source of real casing. `--force` rebuilds existing details rows; `--db <path>` targets another SQLite file; `--drop-legacy` additionally drops the legacy blob tables (`bike_details_cache`, `search_cache`). Also importable as `migrate(db_path=None, drop_blob_table=False, force=False, verbose=True) -> dict` (the dict's `blob_tables_dropped` is a **list of dropped table names**, not a bool). Dropping is **opt-in from both entry points** — `drop_blob_table=True` or `--drop-legacy` — so a default call from either keeps the blob tables, which the parity tests need to read |
| Prompt eval | `scripts/test_scoring.py` | Pytest eval of category-scoring prompts: deterministic parse tests (`-m "not llm"`) + live directional eval via the `claude` CLI, no API key (`-m llm`). See `backend/README.md`. |

**Endpoint** `POST /v1/bike/search`
- Request: all fields optional, at least one required — `search` (free text), `brand`, `model`, `year` (int), `wheel_size` (string), `is_electric` (bool), `has_suspension` (bool), `is_kids` (bool), `bike_type` (string), `price_max` (int), `frame_size` (string), `rider_height_cm` (int), `rider_weight_kg` (int), `gender` (string), `frame_material` (string), `brake_type` (string), `drivetrain` (string), `belt_drive` (bool), `battery_capacity_wh` (int)
- Structured fields are assembled into an enriched query string via `SearchRequest.enriched_query()` (e.g. `"Brand: Trek, Type: Gravel, Year: 2023 — trail riding"`), then passed through the existing pipeline; all fields participate in the SQLite cache key in `main.py`
- **DB-first (TODO-009)**: after a generic-cache miss, if **both** `brand` and `model` are given, `repository.find_bike_by_brand_model()` is tried against the cached searches. A hit returns only the matching bikes (may be fewer than 5) and **short-circuits — no AI call at all**. Only `price_max` is gated on this path, via `find_offer_prices()` joining the four offer endpoints' cached prices (cheapest across all sources; a bike with no parseable price passes). Every other filter (`year`, `frame_size`, `wheel_size`, `frame_material`, `brake_type`, `drivetrain`, `gender`, `rider_height_cm`, `rider_weight_kg`, `battery_capacity_wh`) is **not** gated — no stored model carries those fields. A DB hit deliberately does **not** call `set_cached` (the generic `cache` table has no TTL). A miss, a stale row, or an all-filtered-out result falls through to the phases below. See `backend/README.md` § Search Cache
- Phase 1: Calls `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` once per category (11 parallel calls via `asyncio.gather`) to score relevance against the enriched query
- Phase 2: Filters to categories with score ≥ 5 (minimum 2); allocates exactly 5 bikes weighted by score
- Phase 3: Calls Claude in parallel (one call per qualifying category) to find real bikes
- Returns 5 bike results with brand, model, accessories, match score, and explanation; `search` field in response contains the enriched query
- On parse error: returns empty list for that category — never returns 502 for bad JSON
- Happy path also writes the bikes to the ORM tables `searches` + `bike_results` via `repository.save_search(enriched, bikes)`, each bike keeping its score-weighted rank in `position`

**Endpoint** `GET /v1/bike/search-cache` (follow-up, cache-only — no web/Claude call)
- `?query=<enriched query>` → `CachedSearchResponse` from `searches` + `bike_results` for an exact normalised repeat; 404 if missing/stale (24 h TTL); bikes returned in original score-weighted order (`ORDER BY position`)
- `?brand=<brand>` → every de-duplicated bike of that brand across all fresh cached searches (lookup-by-attribute via `find_bikes_by_brand`). **Exact** `brand_norm` match — a partial brand name does not match, which is the behaviour the live `store.py` implementation always had
- 422 if neither `query` nor `brand` is given

**Endpoint** `GET /v1/bike/details-cache` (follow-up, cache-only — no web/Claude call)
- `?company=<company>&model=<model>` → `BikeDetailsResponse` from the ORM details tables via `repository.get_bike_details`; 404 if missing/stale (30 d TTL). Lookup matches the normalised `bikes.brand_norm`/`model_norm` columns, so casing and surrounding whitespace do not matter; the response echoes the caller's casing

**Endpoint** `POST /v1/bike/details`
- Request: `{"company": "Canyon", "model": "Grizl CF 7 ESC"}`
- Runs three calls in parallel via `asyncio.gather`:
  1. `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` with `web_search_20250305` **8 times** sequentially — one focused search per component category (Frame, Drivetrain, Brakes, Wheels, Cockpit, Saddle & Seatpost, Lighting, Accessories), each using a dedicated `app/prompts/bike_details_{slug}.md` system prompt
  2. `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` with `web_search_20250305` **once** — generates a 4–5 sentence plain-text overview using `app/prompts/bike_description.md` with prompt caching on the system prompt
  3. `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` with `web_search_20250305` **once** — finds the official manufacturer product page URL, then Playwright (`headless=False`) scrapes up to 8 product `<img>` URLs from the rendered page; uses `app/prompts/bike_photos.md`
- Returns: `{ company, model, description: str, components: [...], photos: [url, ...] }`
- Each category response is parsed with the shared `app/json_extract.py` `extract_json()`, which lifts the JSON out of any surrounding narration/code fence — the model routinely prefaces the object with prose
- If a response genuinely contains no JSON: logs the error and skips that category — never returns 502
- Happy path also writes the result to the ORM tables `bikes` + `bike_details` + `bike_detail_photos` via `repository.save_bike_details(company, model, response)` (30 d TTL from `updated_at + ttl_seconds`; reads match the normalised `bikes.brand_norm`/`model_norm` columns, photos stored as rows ordered by `display_order`). Payload shape is unchanged — see `backend/app/DB_MIGRATION.md`

**Endpoint** `POST /v1/bike/review`
- Request: `{"company": "Canyon", "model": "Grizl CF 7 ESC"}`
- Calls `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` with `web_search_20250305` **once** — searches the curated review sources (tier list and weights in `backlog/TODO_018_REVIEW_SOURCE_DISAGREEMENT_AND_REF_ORDER.md`), using `app/prompts/bike_review.md` as the system prompt; returns per-source scores tagged by type
- Backend computes a weighted aggregate `rating` (0–10) from the per-source scores: pro/numeric 3×, pro/qualitative 2×, community 1×, normalised; a non-zero rating requires ≥1 professional source
- Source disagreement: if the spread between the highest and lowest per-source score exceeds `DISAGREEMENT_THRESHOLD` (3.0, module-level constant), `rating` anchors to the mean of the pro/numeric scores instead (falling back to pro/qualitative if none), and the backend appends a sentence to `explanation` stating the spread and which camp the rating follows; `sources_used` still counts every consulted source regardless
- Returns `{ score: int (0–10), explanation: str (5–10 sentences), ref: [url, ...] (sorted Tier 1 → Tier 2 → Tier 3), rating: float (0–10), sources_used: int }`
- The parser scans **every** text block for the first balanced `{...}` (the model often narrates before emitting the JSON, sometimes inside a ```json fence) and strips `<cite>` markup from the explanation
- If no JSON object is found at all, a **repair pass** re-sends the gathered findings with no tools and an assistant prefill of `{`, forcing a JSON-only reply rather than wasting the completed web search
- Cache: keyed on `{company, model}`; stored only when `ref` is non-empty **and** `sources_used >= 1`, so a degenerate `rating: 0.0` row cannot be pinned for that bike
- On JSON parse error: returns `{ score: 0, explanation: "Review unavailable.", ref: [], rating: 0.0, sources_used: 0 }` — never returns 502

**Endpoint** `POST /v1/bike/offer`
- Request: `{"company": "Canyon", "model": "Grizl CF 7 ESC"}`
- Calls `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` with `web_search_20250305` **once** — searches allegro.pl using `app/prompts/bike_offer_allegro.md` as the system prompt
- Returns `{ offers: [{ brand, model, price, is_new, url, photos, source }], info: str }` (1 offer)
- On JSON parse error: returns `{ offers: [], info: raw_text }` — never returns 502

**Endpoint** `POST /v1/bike/used`
- Request: `{"company": "Trek", "model": "Marlin 5"}`
- Calls `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` with `web_search_20250305` **once** — searches olx.pl using `app/prompts/bike_offer_olx.md` as the system prompt; cascade fallback (exact → model-family → brand/category)
- Then Playwright (headless=False) fetches up to 4 photo URLs per listing from OLX CDN
- Returns `{ offers: [{ brand, model, price, is_new, url, photos, source, city }], info: str }` (up to 5 listings, always used)
- On JSON parse error: returns `{ offers: [], info: raw_text }` — never returns 502

**Endpoint** `POST /v1/bike/ceneo`
- Request: `{"company": "Canyon", "model": "Grizl CF 7 ESC"}`
- Calls `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` with `web_search_20250305` **once** — searches ceneo.pl using `app/prompts/bike_offer_ceneo.md` as the system prompt
- Returns `{ offers: [{ brand, model, price, is_new, url, photos: [], source: "ceneo.pl" }], info: str }` (1 offer, no photos)
- On JSON parse error: returns `{ offers: [], info: raw_text }` — never returns 502

**Endpoint** `POST /v1/bike/decathlon`
- Request: `{"company": "Rockrider", "model": "ST 100"}`
- Calls `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` with `web_search_20250305` **once** — searches decathlon.pl using `app/prompts/bike_offer_decathlon.md` as the system prompt
- Returns `{ offers: [{ brand, model, price, is_new, url, photos: [], source: "decathlon.pl" }], info: str }` (1 offer, no photos)
- On JSON parse error: returns `{ offers: [], info: raw_text }` — never returns 502

**Endpoint** `POST /v1/equipment/details`
- Request: `{"company": "POC", "model": "Octal MIPS", "category": "helmets"}` — `company` optional (default `""`), `model` required, `category` optional (`helmets` / `lights` / `locks` / `apparel`; inferred from the item name when omitted, defaulting to `apparel`)
- Runs three calls in parallel via `asyncio.gather` (mirrors `/v1/bike/details`):
  1. `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` **once** — one focused component search using the resolved category's `app/prompts/equipment_details_{slug}.md` prompt (web_search behind a `TODO` flag, like the bike details finder)
  2. `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` with `web_search_20250305` **once** — 4–5 sentence overview using `app/prompts/equipment_description.md` with prompt caching
  3. `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` with `web_search_20250305` **once** — finds the manufacturer product page URL, then Playwright (`headless=False`) scrapes up to 8 product `<img>` URLs; uses `app/prompts/equipment_photos.md`
- Returns `{ company, model, category, description, components: [...], photos: [...] }` — **never** any offer/buy links
- Cache: keyed on `{company, model, category}`; always cached (empty is valid)
- On JSON parse error for the category: logs and skips — never returns 502

**Endpoint** `POST /v1/equipment/review`
- Request: `{"company": "POC", "model": "Octal MIPS"}` — `company` optional, `model` required
- Calls `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` with `web_search_20250305` **once** — searches 3–5 reviews using `app/prompts/equipment_review.md`; review/forum source links only, never offer links
- Returns `{ score: int (0–10), explanation: str, ref: [url, ...] }`
- Cache: keyed on `{company, model}`; cached only when `ref` is non-empty
- On JSON parse error: returns `{ score: 0, explanation: "Review unavailable.", ref: [] }` — never returns 502

**Bike categories** (defined in `app/categories.py`):
Road, Mountain (MTB), Gravel, Hybrid / Commuter, Electric (e-bike), BMX, Cruiser, Touring, Folding, Cyclocross, Kids

**Equipment categories** (defined in `app/equipment_categories.py`):
Helmets, Lights & electronics, Locks & security, Apparel/bags & accessories. **No** equipment offer endpoints exist — equipment has details + review only, never buy/offer links.

**To add a category**: add an entry to `BIKE_CATEGORIES` in `app/categories.py` and create the matching `app/prompts/<slug>.md`.

### Frontend (`/frontend`)

| Layer | File | Responsibility |
|-------|------|----------------|
| Entry point | `src/main.tsx` | React root, mounts `<App>` |
| App shell | `src/App.tsx` | View router (`search` / `details` / `equipment`), search, details, review, allegro offer, ceneo offer, decathlon offer & used-bike state, plus equipment details/review state; all API calls. Clicking a component element name in a bike's spec tree opens the equipment view for that item |
| Search form | `src/components/SearchInput.tsx` | Controlled input + submit button + collapsible Filters panel (Basic group: brand, model, bike type, year, wheel size, frame size, rider height, max price + electric/suspension/kids toggles; Advanced group: gender, frame material, brake type, drivetrain, belt drive + battery capacity shown only when electric); loading state |
| Result card | `src/components/ResultCard.tsx` | Clickable per-bike card: match score, brand + model, accessories chips, explanation, score bar |
| Loading card | `src/components/LoadingCard.tsx` | Shimmer skeleton matching result card dimensions |
| Details view | `src/components/BikeDetailsView.tsx` | Full spec sheet: back nav, bike header, Overview, unified Offers (MergedOffersSection — pools all four sources Allegro/Ceneo/Decathlon/OLX and splits by each offer's `is_new` flag into two stacked cards: Used on top, New below, each sorted cheapest-first via `OfferCategoryCard`/`OfferRow`), Expert Review, component tree whose element names are clickable → equipment view. Reuses shared building blocks from `BikeDetailsShared.tsx` (component-element links are enabled by passing `onElementSelect`) |
| Equipment details view | `src/components/EquipmentDetailsView.tsx` | Equipment spec page: back nav, category eyebrow + item header, Overview, Expert Review, component tree, shimmer skeleton, error + retry, graceful empty state. **No** offers/used sections. Reuses `BikeDetailsShared.tsx` |
| Shared details building blocks | `src/components/BikeDetailsShared.tsx` | `PhotoGallery`, `DescriptionCard`, `ReviewSection`, `LoadingSkeleton`, `CategorySection` — shared by both the bike and equipment detail views. `DescriptionCard` renders its sources via `CitationChips`; `ReviewSection` renders its `ref[]` as a full-width source table below the explanation — one row per source, `stars | domain | "Read review →"`, stars mapped 0–10 → 1–5 from the aggregate `rating` (falling back to `score` for equipment reviews, which have none). The `rating` / `sources_used` values are never rendered on their own — the section is header + explanation + Sources table only |
| Citation chips | `src/components/CitationChips.tsx` | Google-AI-Overview-style "Sources" row: terracotta pill links showing each source's domain (`target="_blank"`, full URL as hover tooltip). Accepts structured `citations: DescriptionCitation[]` (overview) or a bare `urls: string[]` (review `ref[]`) |
| Shared types | `src/types.ts` | `Bike`, `BikeCategory`, `BikeSubcategory`, `ComponentElement`, `SpecItem`, `BikeDetailsResponse`, `BikeDescription`, `TextSegment`, `DescriptionCitation`, `BikeReviewResponse`, `BikeOffer`, `BikeOfferResponse`, `UsedBikeResponse`, `EquipmentDetailsResponse`, `EquipmentReviewResponse`, `EquipmentDetailsPayload`, `EquipmentReviewPayload`, `SearchPayload`, `SearchFilters` (+ `EMPTY_FILTERS`), `ParseResponse` |
| Styles | `src/index.css` | Tailwind v4 `@theme` tokens, Google Fonts import, keyframe animations |
| Vite config | `vite.config.ts` | Tailwind v4 plugin, `/v1` proxy to backend |

**Design system — Direction 5 "Café Rider":**
- Background `#EDE7DC` · Cards `#F5F1EA` · Accent `#C45C38` (terracotta)
- Display font: Barlow Condensed Bold · Body: Lora · Data labels: JetBrains Mono
- All theme tokens live in `src/index.css` under `@theme { --color-*, --font-* }`

**API integration:**
- `POST /v1/bike/search` `SearchPayload` (free text `search` plus any structured filters — see backend endpoint) → `{ search, bikes: [{ brand, model, accessories, match_score, explanation }] }` (5 bikes)
- `POST /v1/bike/details` `{ "company": "...", "model": "..." }` → `{ company, model, description: BikeDescription, components: BikeCategory[] }`
- `POST /v1/bike/review` `{ "company": "...", "model": "..." }` → `{ score, explanation, ref: string[], rating: number (0–10 aggregate), sources_used: number }`
- `POST /v1/bike/offer` `{ "company": "...", "model": "..." }` → `{ offers: BikeOffer[], info: string }` (allegro.pl)
- `POST /v1/bike/ceneo` `{ "company": "...", "model": "..." }` → `{ offers: BikeOffer[], info: string }` (ceneo.pl)
- `POST /v1/bike/decathlon` `{ "company": "...", "model": "..." }` → `{ offers: BikeOffer[], info: string }` (decathlon.pl)
- `POST /v1/bike/used` `{ "company": "...", "model": "..." }` → `{ offers: BikeOffer[], info: string }` (used bikes from OLX, each with optional `city`)
- `POST /v1/equipment/details` `{ "company"?, "model", "category"? }` → `{ company, model, category, description: BikeDescription, components: BikeCategory[], photos: string[] }` (no offer links)
- `POST /v1/equipment/review` `{ "company"?, "model" }` → `{ score, explanation, ref: string[] }` (review/forum links only)
- All endpoints proxied to backend via Vite — no CORS config needed in development
