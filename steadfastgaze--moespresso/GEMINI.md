# Agent and contributor guide

Read this before changing anything. It covers how to work in this repo and the
invariants that must hold. For the architecture, see `DEVGUIDE.md` and `docs/`.

## Public product and fixture boundary

The public product models are DeepSeek-V4-Flash and Ornith. Source paths and
entry points containing `qwen` describe the Qwen architecture implementation
used by Ornith, plus engineering harnesses around that implementation. Their
presence does not add a third public product.

The DeepSeek-V4 fixture boundary is drawn by provenance, not by ladder rung.
Material the upstream antirez/ds4 suite published stays public and committed so
the gates run against those fixtures. Anything captured from a provider stays
under `src/moespresso/correctness/fixtures/deepseek_v4/private/`: API-derived
continuations, selected-token records, and top-logprob payloads, whether they
serve Q1 or Q2, together with the Q4 teacher and candidate logit dumps and the
marker set they are scored against. The WikiText corpus is third-party text
referenced by digest and never copied in. `docs/deepseek_v4_quality.md` is the
authority on which side a given fixture falls.

Unpublished Ornith benchmark questions, answer keys, and verification programs
remain under `src/moespresso/correctness/fixtures/ornith/private/`. Never copy
either private set into source, tests, logs, documentation, wheels, or source
distributions.

The public Ornith gate surface covers the project-owned agentic-coding and
long-context instruments:

```
uv run --locked moespresso-ornith-gate <package> \
  --families agentic_coding,long_context
```

The full hard-reasoning gate additionally requires the ignored private Ornith
fixtures. Source-release tests must inject synthetic questions and keys instead
of reading those files.

## Tooling discipline

- **Use `uv` for everything.** `uv sync` sets up the complete runtime and
  development environment. Tests and lint run lock-strict (`uv run --locked`), so an
  unlocked dependency edit fails immediately. `make lock` is the deliberate
  re-resolve step; commit the updated `uv.lock`. `make dist-check` builds and
  audits the public wheel and source distribution. Never call `python` directly
  and never `pip install` into the environment.
- **Search with `rg`.** Do not use `find ... -exec grep`.
- **Edit with a tool that fails loudly on a missing anchor.** A scripted patch
  that silently misses its anchor and writes nothing is the most common way a
  change appears done but is not. Prefer an editor that errors on a miss; if you
  must script an edit, assert the anchor.
- **No heredocs**, and do not chain shell commands with `&&` or `;` when each is
  already a separate allowed command. Run them as separate calls.
- **Put throwaway scripts in temporary files** and run them via `uv`.

## Writing comments and docs (this repo is public)

Every comment, docstring, and doc ships to a public GitHub repo. Write them the
way a large OSS project does: about the code, impersonal, and dateless. Write for
an unfamiliar reader. These mandatory rules came from real cleanup work.

- **No machine references.** Never "this box", "on this box", "my box/machine/
  laptop/mac", "the rig", "small box", "big box", "16 GB box". The computer is
  never the subject of a sentence. Say "the runtime", "the host", "under memory
  pressure", "when the system is idle".
- **No dates or dev-diary notes.** No "NOTE (2026-06-10):", "Measured on the rig
  (date):", "(owner decision 2026-06-12)". State the finding as a present-tense
  fact and keep the measurement number; drop the date and the first person.
  ("Extending the kick to all-hit layers measured flat (5.42 vs 5.48 tok/s), so
  the gate stays miss-only.")
- **No authority-by-person.** No "owner decision", "owner priority", "product
  priority (owner)". State the decision as a fact: "Default ON; `FOO=0` is the
  kill switch."
- **No private version archaeology.** "pre-v8 gibberish", "the v4 collapse" mean
  nothing to an outside reader. Name the *failure mode* instead: "storing conv1d
  pre-transposed suppresses the coupled norm shift, so norms load ~1.0 too low
  and the model emits garbage."
- **No shouting-caps for emphasis.** Not "THIS", "ONLY", "MUST", "NOT", "GARBAGE",
  "LOUD". Caps are for real identifiers and acronyms (MLX, GPU, IO, LFU, env-var
  names) only. Use plain words or `**bold**` in docs if you must stress a point.
- **No lazy LLM-ese in docs.** Avoid em dashes, antithetical definitions,
  parallel equal-length sentence pairs, and phrases such as "front door",
  "heart of", "by construction", "first-class", or "the tool you reach for".
  Use plain declarative sentences that state the mechanism. Say a fact once.
- **Leave program output and content strings alone.** Error messages, log lines,
  and calibration prompt strings are not comments; do not de-shout or reword them
  for tone.

## Invariants (do not break these)

These are properties the system depends on. Each was learned from a real
failure; respect them or prove with a measurement that the constraint no longer
holds.

**Pipeline and artifacts**
- Resolve once. The inventory maps every tensor name to a role a single time;
  every later phase reads typed fields and never reparses names. Shared/Qwen
  rules live in `inventory.roles`; model-specific naming contracts live under
  model inventory subpackages such as `inventory.deepseek_v4.roles`.
- Every phase reads and writes a content-hashed, versioned artifact. Keep the
  contract in `core/artifact.py` as the single implementation. Fail closed on an
  unknown kind, an unknown major version, an unknown required feature, or a
  missing/mismatched file.
- Package builders use `package_plan` as the writer-facing allocation artifact.
  GGUF recipe import and probe/optimizer output both converge there. The writer
  consumes the plan; the manifest records the resolved tensor decisions.
- Build-time entry points live in `moespresso.package`: `package.convert` for
  probe/optimizer conversion and model-specific subpackages such as
  `package.deepseek_v4.kquant_package` or `package.qwen.kquant_package` for
  GGUF-recipe package builders. Model-specific GGUF recipe mapping lives beside
  those builders, for example `package.deepseek_v4.recipe` and
  `package.qwen.recipe`; `package.kquant_recipe` is the shared GGUF parser and
  fit-check helper. Three further builder groups live in the same package.
  `package.deepseek_v4.iqk_package` assembles converted IQ_K routed-expert
  artifacts under an allocation and reads no GGUF recipe;
  `package.deepseek_v4.iqk_relayout` rewrites a built package's routed bundles
  onto the decode kernels' wire, and `package.iqk_format` plus
  `package.iqk_relayout` hold the shared member and layout contracts. Drafter
  sidecars are package construction too: `package.deepseek_v4.dspark_sidecar`,
  `mtp_sidecar`, and `dflash_sidecar` write a sidecar, and `dspark_bundle`
  attaches a built DSpark sidecar to a package as its declared optional drafter
  component. Do not put conversion orchestration back under `runtime/`.
- Package-owned compatibility files live in `moespresso.package`: tokenizer
  copying, vendored chat templates, and generated jang sidecars are package
  construction concerns. Runtime loads the resulting package files.
- Model-specific correctness gates and replay/debug tools live below a model
  subpackage such as `moespresso.correctness.deepseek_v4`. Keep the
  `correctness` root for shared ladder, gate, golden, reconstruction, and
  reference-codec helpers.
- Model-specific probe codecs, source loaders, and evidence builders live below
  a model subpackage such as `moespresso.probe.deepseek_v4`. Keep the `probe`
  root for shared calibration, quality, roundtrip, GGUF parsing, and weight IO.
- Model-specific source validators and naming contracts live below an inventory
  model subpackage such as `moespresso.inventory.deepseek_v4.static` and
  `moespresso.inventory.deepseek_v4.roles`. Keep the `inventory` root for shared
  header scanning, architecture profiles, and shared/Qwen-style resolver helpers.
- Recipe paths do not emit optimizer decisions. An `optimizer_decision` artifact
  means the probe/optimizer path made the allocation.
- Runtime code reads packages and manifests. It must not import probe,
  optimizer, or recipe-reader internals.
- Model-specific runtime graph adapters, cache contracts, and served-path probes
  live below a model subpackage such as `moespresso.runtime.deepseek_v4`. Keep
  the `runtime` root for shared serving, HTTP, generation, verification, cache
  policy, and generic streaming infrastructure.
- `optimized_kernels_expected` is manifest metadata, default false. Setting it
  is an explicit package-build promotion, and runtime fast paths still validate
  actual tensor formats and shapes before use.
- Package-plan force overrides are build-time tools. They fail closed on unknown
  formats and unmatched patterns unless explicitly allowed, support dry-run
  previews, and record forced decisions in the manifest.
- Calibration is a required input for a calibrated probe. The uniform fallback is
  an explicit opt-in that cannot pass as calibrated.

**Runtime**
- Serve from the manifest. Build the model from the package's own declared
  facts; never reparse source files or guess conventions at load.
- One template render per request. Multiple renders break KV-cache identity.
  `http.render_prompt` is the only render site; the generate path consumes
  pre-rendered text.
- Verification (sha256 + manifest checks) stays off the serve hot path as the
  separate `moespresso-verify` gate. Do not add it to the load path.
- KV cache and prefix reuse are in-memory first. The in-memory store keeps
  plain and speculative producers on separate rails, where a speculative rail
  identifies the cache schema, the numeric producer lattice, the drafter
  family, the sidecar artifact, and the resolved schedule. A resumable DSpark
  entry pairs its target cache with a state capsule at the same public token
  frontier, and lookup probes both rails without moving either entry. Only
  committed public state is published: rejected proposal rows and transient
  verify frontiers never enter a cache tier. A speculative path without the
  complete state protocol serves from a fresh per-request cache and bypasses
  both tiers.
- The disk KV read path restores a target cache only from exact token-prefix
  checkpoints at 256-aligned frontiers, fails closed to cold serving on any
  mismatch, and is gated by the recorded safety evidence that aligned saves
  round-trip bit-identically on hybrid (KV + recurrent-state) caches.
  Serving enables the store by
  default under a per-package root in the user cache directory with an
  LRU byte budget and a write-depth cap (checkpoints cover the shallow
  shared-prefix region; deep cumulative snapshots are write traffic with
  no cross-session value); `MOESPRESSO_DISK_KV=off` is the kill switch,
  and a default-enabled store that cannot open degrades to memory-only
  serving while an explicitly requested one refuses startup. Checkpoint
  writes happen only at proven live frontiers during prefill: token
  accounting proposes, and every positional cache must independently
  report exactly the frontier offset before a write, so an unaligned
  write is structurally impossible. Writes are blocking and atomic; a
  hard write failure logs once and disables the writer for the request,
  restore-time validation failures quarantine the payload, and the TTFT
  cost of writes is measured and logged, never hidden.
- A DSpark drafter-state companion is a second disk persistence class bound to
  a validated target, with its own schema version, index, payload tree, and
  quarantine tree. It never substitutes for a target. The paired prefill
  callback writes only at allowlisted aligned frontiers, and only after both
  the target caches and the drafter state independently report exactly that
  frontier; it commits the target first and the companion second. Restore
  follows the same order: a companion is selected only after its target
  restores, and only for the exact target identity and producer rail. Companion
  failure stays local. A companion that is missing, unreadable, invalid, or
  identity-incompatible is skipped or quarantined on its own while the restored
  target keeps serving the suffix with plain decoding, and companion read and
  write faults set a separate disable flag, so target checkpointing keeps
  running. Target eviction cascades removal to every dependent companion.
- Never split a routed-MoE op by residency. Issuing separate resident and
  missing partial matmuls measured slower despite better wait counters, so the
  pooled routed path keeps one fused operation per layer behind one dispatch
  boundary to Python. Dispatch count on its own is not the rule.

**Correctness**
- Correctness requires token or logit identity. Plausible text can still hide
  wrong logits. Any change to caching, routing, KV, or
  artifact loading must compare logits or top-tokens against a reference.
- Quality ladders are model-specific. DeepSeek-V4 keeps Q0 through Q4 plus the
  teacher-forced WikiText perplexity arm. A package recipe or quantized-math
  change requires Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, and the perplexity arm; the perplexity arm is
  the only instrument that has caught a numeric blowup every numbered gate
  scored as finite. `docs/deepseek_v4_quality.md` records which gates each kind
  of change requires. Other model families need their own quality gates.
- DS4-derived evaluation fixtures need an explicit public/private boundary.
  Before adding expected continuations, official-answer files, or top-logprob
  arrays, check the upstream release boundary. Private oracle material belongs
  outside the committed tree.

## Working method

- Measure or revert. A performance change must clear a real numeric threshold on
  a same-artifact A/B; below it, revert with a short note on why.
- Benchmark with the disk KV tier off (`MOESPRESSO_DISK_KV=off`) unless the
  disk KV tier is itself the subject. The tier writes checkpoints on the first
  request over a prompt and skips or restores on later ones, so request timing
  depends on store state that persists across requests and processes:
  first-request writes inflate TTFT, warm-store runs omit that cost, and an
  estimator that compares two requests absorbs the difference into its result.
  That failure mode inflated a recorded decode level by ten percent.
- Pin `MOESPRESSO_DS4_DRAFTER` to the same value in both arms unless
  speculation is the subject, and record which arm drafted. Automatic drafter
  selection is capacity-gated, so the decision depends on the host's usable
  wired budget and can land differently across two runs of the same code. The
  in-memory speculative producer rail is a second source of request-to-request
  state that `MOESPRESSO_DISK_KV=off` does not clear. The startup line names
  the resolved drafter state, so an unpinned arm can still be identified from
  the log.
- Prove an A/B's two arms actually differ before trusting a null result. A common
  trap is two arms that silently run the same code path.
- A metric used to judge a change must be independent of the change.
- When you repurpose a probe or a one-off script as a builder, re-run the full
  builder checklist; a shortcut once shipped packages missing the cold-start
  hotlist.
- For any shared-mutable-state code (the streaming expert pools), pre-reason the
  failure modes and test under contention. Publish after all loads complete and
  under all locks.
- Run `make lint` and `make test` before considering a change done, including
  for changes touching conversion, package writing, runtime serving,
  MLX/Jang/mlx-kquant/mlx-iqk paths or
  model-specific quality gates.
- Run `make roadtest` for cache, checkpoint, and restart-resume changes. It
  drives a cumulative agentic session against a really served package through
  the `agentlib/` runner and asserts cache events, disk checkpoints, and
  restart resume turn over turn, which no unit test covers. It is opt-in and
  GPU-bound, so it is never part of `make test`.
- Run `make dist-check` for release-facing changes. The wheel and source
  distribution must exclude `specs_archive/`, every `*/private/` fixture tree,
  environment files, caches, bytecode, and machine-local paths. They must carry
  `LICENSE-MIT`, `LICENSE-APACHE-2.0`, and `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES`, and
  the expected DeepSeek-V4, Ornith, and technical Qwen architecture surfaces. The
  audit pins the wheel's `License-File` metadata to exactly those three names
  and compares each one byte for byte against the repository copy, so it
  confirms the files ship and says nothing about their content. Vendoring code
  means updating `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES` by hand.

## Where to start

1. `README.md` for what the project is and how to run it.
2. `DEVGUIDE.md` for the architecture and the source map.
3. The `docs/` file for the subsystem you are touching.
4. The tests for that subsystem; they are the behavior specification.
