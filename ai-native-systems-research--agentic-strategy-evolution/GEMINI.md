# Nous — project conventions

This file is auto-loaded by Claude Code on every session in this repo. The
rules below are non-negotiable; when they conflict with general AI/coding
defaults, **the rules here win**.

## 🚫 Tests must NEVER make live LLM calls

**No unit, integration, or end-to-end test in this repo may make a real
API call to Anthropic, OpenAI, or any other LLM provider. Period.**

Why this is a hard rule:
- Tests run on every CI build, every contributor's laptop, and every PR
  rebase. Live LLM calls would burn tokens for no signal — the test
  result depends on what the model said today, not on the code under test.
- Token budget for `nous` is mission-critical. We refuse to spend it on
  CI churn.
- Live calls are non-deterministic. A flaky test from a model rephrasing
  itself is worse than no test.

**How to test correctly:**

| Code under test | How to mock |
|---|---|
| `LLMDispatcher` | Pass `completion_fn=` in the constructor — a callable that returns canned `chat.completions`-shaped objects. See `tests/test_llm_dispatch.py`'s `_make_fake_completion` for the pattern. |
| `CLIDispatcher` (claude -p subprocess) | Patch `orchestrator.cli_dispatch.subprocess.run` — return a `subprocess.CompletedProcess` with the JSON the test wants. See `tests/test_cli_dispatch.py`. |
| `SDKDispatcher` (Claude Agent SDK) | Pass `sdk_runner=` in the constructor — a callable returning `SDKResult`. See `tests/test_sdk_dispatch.py`'s `_ScriptedRunner`. |
| `InlineDispatcher` | Set up the `.nous_response_*` signal file in tmp_path before calling dispatch. |
| Stub-driven flows | Use `StubDispatcher` from `orchestrator.dispatch` — it produces valid schema-conformant artifacts with no LLM at all. |

**Active enforcement:** `tests/conftest.py` installs an autouse fixture
(`block_live_llm_calls`) that:
1. Strips `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` from the env so any
   accidental real-client construction fails loudly instead of silently
   billing.
2. Patches `urllib.request.urlopen` to refuse `api.anthropic.com`,
   `api.openai.com`, and `api.litellm.ai` hosts.
3. Patches `claude_agent_sdk.query` (when installed) to a hard-fail.

If a test triggers any of these guards, the fix is to inject a fake at
the dispatcher's seam — never to disable the guard. The guards are the
backstop; the seams are the contract.

## Behavioral testing only

When the test mock is in place, write **behavioral** tests:
- ✓ Assert what's on disk after `dispatcher.dispatch(...)`.
- ✓ Assert metrics rows in `llm_metrics.jsonl`.
- ✓ Assert artifacts match a JSON Schema.
- ✗ Don't assert which method was called on the mock.
- ✗ Don't assert argv shape, internal helper invocation, or attribute access.

The seam is the contract; the implementation is free to evolve.

## Token-budget discipline (production code)

Beyond tests, Nous itself must be frugal with tokens:
- **Methodology stays in `CLAUDE.md`** (auto-loaded by Claude Code), not
  in per-call prompts. The thin templates in `prompts/methodology/*_thin.md`
  carry only per-iteration context.
- **System blocks are cached** (`cache_control: ephemeral`). Any code
  that constructs an SDK call with a static system_prompt should rely
  on this, and any change that breaks within-iteration cache locality
  must be measured (`nous cost --cache-stats`) and justified.
- **Read-only mapping uses Explore subagents**, not Opus. See
  `orchestrator/explore_design.py`.

## Campaign-artifact location (issue #239)

Campaign work_dirs default to ``<target_repo>/.nous/<run_id>/`` for
backward compat, but the recommended setup is to export
``NOUS_CAMPAIGN_PARENT`` so artifacts live OUTSIDE the target:

```bash
# Add to your shell rc:
export NOUS_CAMPAIGN_PARENT=~/Documents/Projects/nous-campaigns
```

When set, work_dirs land at ``$NOUS_CAMPAIGN_PARENT/<run_id>/``.
The target repo's working tree stays clean — ``git stash -u`` won't
capture campaign output, ``git status`` stays uncluttered, ``git add .``
won't accidentally stage campaign content.

**The split that matters:**

| Artifact type | Lives at | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Code worktrees per arm (#133) | ``<target>/.nous-experiments/<run>/<arm>/`` | They ARE code FOR the target repo; share its git history. Unaffected by the env var. |
| Campaign artifacts (state, ledger, principles, findings, JSON results) | ``$NOUS_CAMPAIGN_PARENT/<run_id>/`` if env var set, else ``<target>/.nous/<run_id>/`` | About *experiment results*, not target's code. Env-var location avoids working-tree pollution. |

Path resolution lives in ``orchestrator/work_dir_resolver.py`` —
single source of truth (``RESOLUTION RULES`` marker). Three call
sites (``setup_work_dir``, ``cli.resolve_work_dir``, ``cli._cmd_run``)
delegate there. State.json records the resolved ``work_dir`` and
``repo_path`` for collision detection and per-campaign provenance.

``find_existing_work_dir`` provides migration grace: pre-#239
campaigns at the legacy path are still findable when the user later
sets the env var, so existing campaigns don't break on env-var
adoption.

## PR workflow (project owner: @sriumcp)

1. Branch off `upstream/reflective` (NOT `main`).
2. Push to `origin` (the fork at `sriumcp/agentic-strategy-evolution`).
3. Open PR with base `upstream/reflective`, head `sriumcp:<branch>`.
4. PR body links the issue with `Closes #N` (or `Refs #N` for partials).
5. Stack PRs when one logical change builds on another rather than waiting
   for merge — see `docs/plans/CHECKPOINT.md` for the pattern.

## Graded-complexity tier discipline (issue #159)

Each iteration's bundle declares an optional ``complexity_tier`` (1..4):

| Tier | Description |
|---|---|
| 1 | single mechanism, single knob, treatment vs control |
| 2 | single mechanism + multi-knob OR ablation OR dose-response on one knob |
| 3 | multi-mechanism interactions, super-additivity, dose-response across knobs |
| 4 | cross-system / cross-workload generalization, robustness across regimes |

**Rule: iteration N may use any tier ≤ N.** Iter 1 → tier 1 only. Iter 2
→ tier 1 or 2. Etc. Sophisticated hypotheses are allowed, just *deferred
until simpler ones are ruled out*. The bundle's ``tier_justification``
explains the chosen tier given the iteration index and prior refutations.

The discipline is enforced through visibility, not refusal. The design
gate (``orchestrator.complexity_tier.format_tier_summary``) prints the
tier and prior-iteration tiers, and prominently flags jumps of more than
one tier across iterations. Humans can override; agents cannot
silently leap from tier 1 to tier 3.

## Meta-findings emit at campaign end (issue #155)

Every campaign's terminal transition writes `meta_findings.json` at the
campaign work-dir. Three streams:

1. `campaign_design_lessons` — how to structure future campaigns better.
2. `target_system_asks` — what the target repo could improve.
3. `nous_asks` — what Nous itself could improve.

The emitter (`orchestrator.meta_findings.emit_meta_findings`) is **pure
Python** — zero LLM tokens. Heuristics over `ledger.json`,
`principles.json`, per-iteration `findings.json`, `retry_log.jsonl`,
and `llm_metrics.jsonl` produce structured entries with concrete
citations (iter-N, file path, tool name, error string, numeric
measurement). The validator floor (`validate_evidence`) rejects
aspirational platitudes regardless of source. See `docs/data-model.md`
for the schema.

## Spec fidelity (issue #246 / F1, friction-report #245)

Every campaign should declare ``locked_parameters`` (and, when
applicable, ``locked_workload``) for every knob whose deviation
would invalidate the experiment. The validator hard-fails any
bundle whose ``experiment_spec.verified_parameters`` deviates from
``locked_parameters`` — regardless of ``--auto-approve``. This
closes the spec-fidelity gap that allowed paper-memorytime-mirage
iter-1 to silently rewrite four locked workload parameters.

Authoring discipline lives in ``docs/campaign-authoring-guide.md``
(the "what to lock" inventory + the rehearsal-as-instrument
worked example). The full friction-report resolution map is in
``docs/friction-245-resolution.md``.
