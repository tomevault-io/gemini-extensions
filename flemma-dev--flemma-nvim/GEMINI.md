# Repository Guidelines

Flemma.nvim is a Neovim plugin for LLM-powered chat in `.chat` buffers. The buffer is the conversation — portable, re-parseable, and version-controllable. Keep each contribution focused, reversible, and well-documented so the next contributor can continue seamlessly.

# Part 1: Architecture & Conventions

## Critical Rules

These are counter-default behaviors — violating them breaks the build or introduces bugs:

- **All JSON through `require("flemma.utilities.json")`** — never bare `vim.json.*` or `vim.fn.json_*` (JSON `null` becomes truthy `vim.NIL` instead of `nil`)
- **All structural buffer inspection through the AST** — never regex/substring matching on buffer lines
- **All `require()` calls at file top** — `make qa` enforces this
- **Full EmmyLua type annotations on all production code** — `make qa` enforces this
- **Never `---@diagnostic disable` as an easy fix** — use `---@cast`, `--[[@as type]]`, or restructure; suppressions only for genuine LuaLS limitations

## Design Principles

- **Flemma is stateless; the buffer is the state.** All conversation data, tool calls, and results must be fully represented in the buffer text. Never rely on in-memory state that would be lost when Neovim restarts or when a `.chat` file is shared. If you need to persist information (e.g., synthetic IDs for providers that don't supply them), embed it in the buffer format itself so it can be parsed back later. In-memory structures (`state.lua`) are ephemeral caches rebuilt from the buffer on demand — they are never the source of truth.

- **The outgoing request is a product of _(conversation, environment)_.** The buffer determines what was said; the environment determines how it's delivered. "Environment" means the config layer stack (SETUP/RUNTIME layers below FRONTMATTER), the tool registry, the personality builder's ambient state (`cwd`, `git_branch`, `date`, `time`, project context files on disk), template expression evaluation (`os.date`, `os.time`, `include()`, `math.random`), and model metadata from the registry. Given the same `.chat` buffer and the same environment, the request is deterministic. When adding new inputs to the request pipeline, decide which half they belong to — conversation state goes in the buffer, ambient context goes through the environment — and never mix the two.

- **All structural operations go through the AST.** The parsed AST (cached per buffer via `state.ast_cache`) is the only way to inspect conversation structure — roles, tool use/result blocks, thinking blocks, positions. If the AST lacks information you need, extend the AST rather than bypassing it. Direct buffer manipulation is only appropriate for content injection (tool results, streaming text) and UI concerns (spinners, extmarks).

- **Async/blocking work in the send pipeline goes through `flemma.readiness`.** Mirrors the `Confirmation` pattern in `lua/flemma/preprocessor/context.lua`: leaf code that would block on subprocess IO (e.g., `secrets.resolve`, `tools.get_for_prompt`) raises `error(readiness.Suspense.new(message, boundary))`. Orchestrators (`core.send_to_provider`, `usage.prefetch.fire_fetch`, `:Flemma usage:estimate`) wrap their pipeline in `pcall`, check `readiness.is_suspense(err)`, subscribe via `boundary:subscribe(cb)`, and retry the whole pipeline on completion. Boundaries are keyed by string (e.g., `secrets:vertex:access_token`) and shared — concurrent consumers of the same key share one in-flight runner. Never use `vim.system(cmd):wait()` in code reachable from the send pipeline — use the async `vim.system(cmd, opts, on_exit)` form behind a boundary.

- **EmmyLua type annotations are mandatory.** Every production file must have full LuaLS type coverage — `---@class`, `---@param`, `---@return`, `---@field`, `---@type` on all public and private functions, fields, and return values. New code without type annotations will not pass `make qa`.

- **Name modules according to their file path** (`lua/flemma/provider/adapters/openai.lua` → `flemma.provider.adapters.openai`). Public APIs belong in the module that owns the domain — tool registration lives in `flemma.tools`, provider registration in `flemma.provider.registry`, session access in `flemma.session`, etc. Don't pollute `init.lua` with single-use accessors; users require the specific module directly.

- **Verify claims before asserting them.** Commit messages, comments, and docs that make claims you haven't tested rot fast and mislead the next contributor. If you write "X is only reachable via Y," back it with a test.

- **Before mirroring a pattern, understand why it lives where it does.** Patterns are shaped by surrounding context — which capability branch owns them, which module, which provider. A mirror that ignores context becomes a leak into shared code.

- **"Just make it work" beats "validate and warn".** When a user configures something we can't honor on the current model, prefer silent graceful fallback over warnings. Warnings that fire on every request are noise; reserve them for config with no useful interpretation.

- **Start with the smallest change that solves the problem.** If three lines in one file would do, don't reach for shared infrastructure. Complexity creep is the tax on going in search of trouble.

- Make incremental changes that isolate behaviour shifts so refactors remain reviewable.

## Request Lifecycle

Explore `lua/flemma/` to understand the codebase — module files are named descriptively and each has a `---@class` annotation explaining its role. The request lifecycle flows through these stages:

### Input: Buffer → Structured Data

`parser.lua` parses `.chat` buffer text into an AST. `ast/` defines the node types (document, message, segments for tool use, tool result, thinking, job result, text). The AST is cached per buffer in `state.lua` and is the sole interface for inspecting conversation structure. `preprocessor/` runs rewriters and confirmations on the parsed conversation before it reaches the provider — context injection, file reference resolution, and user confirmations live here.

### Orchestration: Driving the Conversation

`core.lua` is the main orchestrator — it constructs providers inline per-request, manages the send→stream→idle cycle, and drains background job completions at conversation idle. `processor.lua` evaluates template expressions and frontmatter, feeding into `pipeline.lua` which validates tool resolution and runs the request. `sink.lua` accumulates streaming data in hidden scratch buffers. `readiness.lua` provides the async suspense/boundary system for non-blocking credential resolution and other blocking work. `autopilot.lua` manages auto-continue behavior with debounced resume delay and guards (insert-mode, disarm-on-cancel).

**Gotcha:** Any `pcall` between a leaf that raises `Suspense` and the orchestrator that catches it will silently swallow the sentinel. Check `readiness.is_suspense(err)` and re-raise first in any pcall handler in the send pipeline. This includes the compiled-template expression evaluator (`templating/compiler.lua` — expressions wrap each `{{ ... }}` in a `pcall`; `__emit_expr_error` must re-raise suspense). The `make qa` `lint-pcall-rethrow` gate enforces this for `core.lua`, `preprocessor/init.lua`, `preprocessor/runner.lua`, `processor.lua`, `provider/base.lua`, `templating/compiler.lua`, `usage/prefetch.lua`, and `commands.lua`. New files in the send path must be added to that script's `WATCHED_FILES`.

### Execution: Providers, Tools, and Jobs

`provider/base.lua` defines the provider contract (metatable inheritance). `provider/normalize.lua` handles parameter normalization (flatten, max_tokens, thinking, preset resolution). `provider/adapters/` contains implementations — `anthropic.lua`, `openai.lua`, `vertex.lua`, `moonshot.lua` — each request-scoped with no global instance.

`tools/` manages the tool registry (`get_all()` filters by `enabled`), executor, injector, and approval flow. Built-in tool definitions live in `tools/definitions/builtin/` (bash, edit, find, grep, ls, read, write, mcporter). Harness tools live in `tools/definitions/harness/` (jobs status). The registry is a table keyed by name — `pairs()` does not guarantee order; sort by name when building tool arrays for deterministic prompt caching.

**Background jobs** allow tools to run asynchronously. The executor assigns job IDs, routes completions to a queue, and supports mid-flight backgrounding (promoting a running foreground tool to background). Job completions drain at conversation idle via `core.drain_job_completions()`. The `flemma:jobs:status` harness tool lets the LLM query job state, cross-checked against the AST for buffer truth. The `background` parameter is auto-injected into async tool schemas.

**Gotcha:** Custom secrets resolvers must implement `resolve_async(self, credential, ctx, callback)`. The walker prefers it over sync `:resolve`. A resolver that does `vim.system(cmd):wait()` in sync `:resolve` will block the editor. Additionally, `provider:get_api_key()` returns `string|nil` only — failures flow through suspense boundaries, not return-value diagnostics.

### Output: Buffer Writing and UI

`buffer/` provides buffer manipulation primitives — `editing.lua` for structural edits and `writequeue.lua` for ordered async writes. `messages/` externalizes user-facing buffer messages as `.chat` template files with a naming convention.

`ui/` is decomposed into subsystems: `ui/bar/` (activity bar, background jobs observability), `ui/folding/` (fold rules, merge logic), plus indicators (tool status extmarks), highlights, and syntax. `symbols.lua` centralizes Unicode glyphs used across UI components.

**Gotcha:** Tests must assert on observable output (window config, buffer text, extmark positions), not internal state. Internal fields can stay coherent while the rendered UI is wrong. Two regressions slipped past the Bar refactor's CI (duplicate spinner glyph, full-width corner floats) because specs checked `bar._some_flag` instead of window dimensions and buffer contents.

### Infrastructure

- `config/` — layered config system: `init.lua` (public facade: `get`, `materialize`, `apply`, `writer`, `inspect`), `store.lua` (DEFAULTS→SETUP→RUNTIME→FRONTMATTER layers), `proxy.lua` (read/write proxy metatables), `schema.lua` (definition with defaults, DISCOVER, aliases), `types.lua` (generated EmmyLua types)
- `schema/` — general-purpose schema DSL engine: `init.lua` (factory: `s.string()`, `s.object()`, etc.), `types.lua` (node classes), `navigation.lua` (tree traversal)
- `secrets/` — credential resolution with async resolvers; `resolvers/` contains built-in resolver implementations
- `templating/` — Lua template engine; `builtins/` for built-in template functions
- `hooks.lua` + `emittable.lua` — event system with internal subscribers (graduated alongside background jobs)
- `migration.lua` — centralized load-time buffer mutations
- `utilities/` — stateless shared infrastructure: `json.lua`, `path.lua`, `roles.lua`, `modeline.lua`, `truncate.lua`, `display.lua`, `registry.lua`, `buffer.lua`
- `loader.lua` — dynamic module loading (Flemma's extensibility contract for user-provided module paths in config)
- `bridge.lua` — circular dependency resolution between modules
- `models/` — model definitions, metadata, pricing
- `personalities/` — personality builder (system prompts, styles); ambient state (`cwd`, `git_branch`, `date`, etc.)
- `session.lua` — session/request tracking, cost accounting
- `usage/` — token usage estimation and prefetch

## Directory Naming Convention

A **plural** top-level directory means the directory _is_ a collection — the files ARE the concept (`tools/`, `secrets/`, `personalities/`, `models/`, `utilities/`, `integrations/`). A **singular** directory is a subsystem with a capability (`provider/`, `preprocessor/`, `sandbox/`, `config/`, `ast/`, `schema/`, `ui/`, `templating/`, `codeblock/`).

Sub-folders name a **role** (what the files do or are), not provenance: `tools/definitions/builtin/`, `secrets/resolvers/`, `sandbox/backends/`, `preprocessor/rewriters/`, `codeblock/parsers/`, `templating/builtins/`. Sub-folder contents are by convention the built-in instances of that role.

Avoid self-referential sub-folders (e.g., `provider/providers/`) and avoid a `.lua` file next to a directory with the same name — collapse to `foo/init.lua` instead.

## Buffer Format Reference

`.chat` files use role markers, structured headers, and fenced blocks:

- **Role markers**: `@System:`, `@You:`, `@Assistant:` at the start of a line; content extends until the next marker
- **Tool Use** (`@Assistant` messages): ``**Tool Use:** `tool_name` (`tool_id`)`` followed by a fenced JSON code block with the tool input
- **Tool Result** (`@You` messages): `` **Tool Result:** `tool_id` `` optionally followed by a modeline-parseable `(...)` suffix, then a fenced code block with the result
- **Job Result** (`@You` messages): `` **Job Result:** `job_id` `` — linked to a tool_result via the job ID; follows the same status suffix convention
- **Tool/job status suffix**: `(pending)` / `(approved)` / `(denied)` / `(rejected)` / `(aborted)` / `(error)` on tool_result/job_result headers, or explicit `(status=pending sandbox=false)` for mixed metadata — unrecognized tokens round-trip via the `meta` field on the AST node
- **Thinking blocks** (`@Assistant` messages): `<thinking>` / `</thinking>` tags, optionally with `provider:signature="base64"` attribute or `redacted` flag
- **Expressions**: `{{ lua_expression }}` in `@System`/`@You` messages (sandboxed environment with `math`, `string`, `table`, `utf8`, select `vim.fn`/`vim.fs` functions, and essential globals)
- **File references**: `@./path`, `@../path`, `@~/path`, or `@//absolute/path` (with optional `;type=mime/type` suffix) in `@You` messages

All tool IDs, job IDs, and metadata are embedded in buffer text so `.chat` files are portable and re-parseable.

## Coding Conventions

### Module pattern

Every module uses `local M = {}` / `return M`. Every module has a `---@class flemma.ModuleName` annotation at the top.

### Require placement

All `require()` calls go at the top of the file, before any function definition. The only exceptions are:

- **Dynamic requires via `flemma.loader`** — when resolving a module path string at runtime (from config, user input, or a `BUILTIN_*` list), use `loader.load(path)` instead of bare `require(path)`. The loader is Flemma's extensibility contract: users put string paths in config (e.g., `{ tools = { modules = { "my.custom.tool" } } }`) and the loader turns them into loaded modules. Never use bare `require()` for dynamic module path resolution.
- **Vim string-context requires** — inside `foldexpr`, `foldtext`, or keymap strings that Vim evaluates in a separate Lua context

`make qa` enforces this convention. If you need to call a function from a module that would create a circular require dependency, use `flemma.bridge` — see its module documentation.

### Type annotation patterns

- Optional fields: `---@field end_line? integer`
- Union types for nullable: `table|nil`, `string|nil`
- `---@alias` for discriminated unions: `---@alias flemma.ast.Segment flemma.ast.TextSegment|...`
- Use `---@cast` and `--[[@as type]]` for type narrowing after guards
- `---@diagnostic disable-next-line` is a last resort, only for genuine LuaLS limitations (e.g., `return-type-mismatch` on `setmetatable` returns in provider `new()`)

### Naming

- **Full, descriptive names** — never abbreviate (`definition` not `def_entry`, `provider_name` not `prov_name`)
- Functions: verb-based (`build_request()`, `parse_response()`, `get_api_key()`)
- Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` at module top
- Types/classes: `PascalCase` with dot-namespacing following file path (`flemma.ast.DocumentNode`)
- Private functions: `local function name()` (not exported on `M`)

### File naming

Production file names prefer single words; multi-word descriptive names use snake_case (`secret_tool.lua`, `coding_assistant.lua`), while established domain concepts are concatenated (`writequeue.lua`, `textobject.lua`). Test files use `_spec.lua` suffix.

**Integration module filenames** (`lua/flemma/integrations/*.lua`) mirror the plugin's repo name with any `.nvim` suffix dropped, and hyphens are preserved (e.g., `nvim-treesitter-context.lua`). Internal type identifiers and public config keys are not renamed when a filename changes.

### JSON handling

**Always use `require("flemma.utilities.json")`** for all JSON operations. Never use `vim.fn.json_decode`, `vim.fn.json_encode`, `vim.json.decode`, or `vim.json.encode` directly. The wrapper uses `luanil` options so JSON `null` becomes Lua `nil` (not `vim.NIL`). Bare `vim.json.decode` produces truthy `vim.NIL` userdata that passes `if x then` guards and crashes on math/string operations.

### Error handling

- `flemma.notify` for user-facing errors and warnings
- `flemma.logging` (conventionally `local log = require("flemma.logging")`) for debug/trace logging
- Return tuples `value, err` for operational results where the caller handles failures inline
- Never `error()` for recoverable situations

## Lua/LuaJIT Gotchas

- **`tostring(5.0)` returns `"5"` in LuaJIT**, not `"5.0"`. Account for this in assertions and string formatting involving numeric results.
- **`a and b or c` fails when `b` is falsy.** `true and false or x` evaluates to `x`, not `false`. Always use explicit `if/else` when the "true" branch value could be `false` or `nil`. This bit a dual-call convention closure (`maybe_item ~= nil and maybe_item or self_or_item`) where `maybe_item` was legitimately `false`.
- **`vim.NIL` is truthy.** JSON `null` decoded without `luanil` options produces `vim.NIL` userdata that passes `if x then` guards. This is why the JSON wrapper rule exists.

# Part 2: Agent Operating Contract

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

- **`make qa`** — run all quality gates (luacheck, type-check, imports, test). Silent on success; on failure, re-runs only the failed gate(s) with visible output. This is the single command to run before committing.
- **`make types`** — regenerate `lua/flemma/config/types.lua` after any schema change. `make qa` type-checks but does not regenerate.
- **`make develop`** — launch Flemma from the working directory for manual testing.
- **`make format`** — reformat the entire codebase via `treefmt` (stylua, shfmt, nixfmt, prettier, yamlfmt, taplo). Cached — only reformats changed files. **Run before every commit, not just at session end.**

### Multi-Version Test Matrix

`make qa` runs the test suite against every Neovim version listed in `$NVIM_VERSIONS` (set by the Nix dev shell). Gate names include the version — e.g., `test-neovim-0.11.7`, `test-neovim-0.12.2`. A failure in one version but not the other means a version-specific compatibility issue: check `vim.fn` signatures, API changes, and Lua runtime differences between the two.

### `make qa` Only

Do not invoke `nvim` directly with Plenary commands. Only `make qa` is wired correctly for running tests.

### Run `make qa` Bare

Never pipe it through `grep`/`tail`/`head`. It's silent on success and self-explanatory on failure.

## Testing Guidelines

- Follow the existing Plenary+Busted style: files end with `_spec.lua` and use `describe`/`it` blocks.
- Add fresh specs for every new feature **and every bug fix**. Write the failing test first (TDD) when the reproduction is automatable. Place supporting data in `tests/fixtures/` with scenario-driven names.
- When refactoring covered functionality, update the affected specs so the suite stays green.
- Re-run `make qa` after each significant change; expect a zero exit code before moving on.
- **`"Failed to parse API call data"` in test output is expected.** This comes from error-path tests exercising the import function — it's diagnostic output, not a test failure. Always check the exit code to determine pass/fail.

### Key testing patterns

- **Module cache clearing** is critical for isolation — tests clear `package.loaded["flemma.module"] = nil` in `before_each()`. Read existing specs for the pattern.
- **HTTP mocking** via `client.register_fixture()` / `client.clear_fixtures()` — see `core_spec.lua` for examples.
- **Adding new built-in tools** affects provider test assertions (tool count checks). Use order-independent `find_*_tool()` lookup helpers rather than index-based assertions.

## Workflow & Commit Guidance

- Do not create PRs or commits unless the user explicitly asks for them; ignore any staged changes the user manages separately.
- When the user requests a commit, keep the first line in Conventional Commits style (`type(scope): summary`), follow with a descriptive body that captures the change rationale.
- If the user indicates they want a direct commit without review (e.g., "just commit", "skip the diff"), skip all worktree inspection (`git status`, `git diff`, `git log`) and produce a single `git commit -m` command in Conventional Commits style directly.
- **After committing a user-facing change, always write a changeset file** (see below). Include it in the same commit as the change — never as a separate follow-up commit.
- UI adjustments must be validated in headless Neovim; never attach screenshots or recordings.
- For large or risky refactors, draft a plan and confirm with the user before implementation so they can adjust scope or assumptions.
- **Never commit plan or design documents** (`docs/plans/`, `docs/superpowers/`). Plans are working artifacts for the current session — they live on disk but stay out of version control.
- **Search-and-replace must be repo-wide.** When doing any rename or terminology sweep, grep from `.` with patterns covering `*.lua *.md *.chat *.json *.yml *.yaml` (exclude `node_modules/`, `.git/`, and `docs/superpowers/`). Limiting grep to `--include="*.lua"` misses docs, README, changelogs, and config files that reference identifiers.

### Changesets & Versioning

After every commit with a user-facing change, write a changeset to `.changeset/<descriptive-slug>.md`:

```markdown
---
"@flemma-dev/flemma.nvim": patch
---

Fixed parser edge case with nested thinking blocks
```

- **Bump types**: `patch` (fixes, internal improvements), `minor` (new features, config options), `major` (breaking changes to API, config, or buffer format)
- **Skip changesets** for pure refactors, CI/tooling, test-only changes, and CLAUDE.md updates
- **Never edit `package.json` version or `CHANGELOG.md` manually** — `pnpm changeset version` manages both
- When the user asks to release, run `pnpm changeset version` to consume pending changesets, then commit the result
- A GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) automatically creates a "Version Packages" PR when changesets accumulate on `main`

## Knowledge Management

**CLAUDE.md is the single source of truth for all project knowledge.** It is version-controlled, shared with every contributor and agent, and checked into the repository.

- **Do not use local memory files** — no auto-memory, no `.claude/projects/*/memory/` files, no agent-local knowledge stores. Knowledge that isn't in CLAUDE.md doesn't exist for the next contributor.
- **Do not split CLAUDE.md into linked files** — only files at known paths (`CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/CLAUDE.md`) are auto-loaded. Linked files require manual reads and get missed.
- When you resolve a non-obvious issue, add it to the appropriate section (Lua/LuaJIT Gotchas or Project-Specific Pitfalls below). Keep entries concise: one line for the symptom, one for the fix/insight.

## Project-Specific Pitfalls

- **Stale `vim-pack-dir` copy shadows working-directory changes.** When running headless Neovim, always use `set rtp^=...` (prepend) not `set rtp+=...` (append). Verify with `debug.getinfo(require('flemma.ui').some_fn, 'S').source`.

- **Always wrap `nvim --headless` in `timeout`.** Ad-hoc headless spikes can hang indefinitely on an unexpected prompt, modal error, or blocking autocmd. Prefix with `timeout 10 nvim --headless ...`.

- **Provider `new()` metatable chain.** Each provider owns its constructor with the full chain set atomically in the `setmetatable` literal before `self:_new_response_buffer()`. The chain is typically `self → M → base`, but intermediate bases exist (e.g., `moonshot → openai_chat → base`). This makes metatable ordering bugs structurally impossible.

- **Tool header backtick format is critical.** The parser relies on exact backtick wrapping in ``**Tool Use:** `name` (`id`)`` and `` **Tool Result:** `id` `` headers. Missing or misplaced backticks will cause parsing failures.

## Session Closure Checklist

- Run `make format` to reformat the entire codebase.
- Run `make qa` and confirm it passes.
- Note outstanding follow-ups, failing tests, or context the next agent will need to resume work.
