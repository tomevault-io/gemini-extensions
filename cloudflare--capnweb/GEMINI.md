# The Cap'n Web docs site

Astro, with [Nimbus](https://nimbus-docs.com) (`@cloudflare/nimbus-docs`) as the docs framework. The
package handles content schemas, sidebar/TOC, MDX to markdown, search, OG cards, `llms.txt`, build
hooks, and the `nimbus-docs` CLI. Everything in `src/` is a real file in this repo and yours to
edit, including the files the scaffold wrote.

`README.md` next to this file explains why the site looks and works the way it does: the palette,
the page shell, the WebGL hero, the example playgrounds, the traps. Read it before changing anything
visual.

## Working in here

This package is part of the repo pnpm workspace. Install once at the repo root:

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm --filter capnweb-docs dev      # http://localhost:4321
pnpm --filter capnweb-docs build    # static output in ./dist
pnpm --filter capnweb-docs check    # astro check: types, content collections
pnpm --filter capnweb-docs lint:docs
```

The repo root `.npmrc` pins `@cloudflare` to the public registry so installs of
`@cloudflare/nimbus-docs` (and other public `@cloudflare` packages) work even when a user-level
npmrc maps that scope to an internal registry. Do not remove that line to "fix" a local registry
preference.

Production and PR preview deploys both go through Workers Builds
(`pnpm --filter capnweb-docs build` / `pnpm --filter capnweb-docs exec wrangler deploy`).
`README.md`, "Deployment" and "Previews", is the detail.

`predev` and `prebuild` build the library, then run `bundle-size` and `playgrounds`. The playground
bundler reads the library's **build output**, so that root build is required before demos show up.

## Writing docs

Frontmatter validates against Nimbus's `docsSchema`. `title` is required. Sidebar **groups** are
declared in `astro.config.ts`; position **within** a group comes from frontmatter:

```mdx
---
title: My page
description: One-line summary.
sidebar:
  order: 3
---

Content here. The H1 comes from `title` -- don't repeat it in the body.

## Section heading
```

Rules:

- **Components must be PascalCase and registered in `src/components.ts`.** A pre-build validator
  fails the build on an unregistered tag, with a "did you mean" hint.
- **Partials use `<Render file="..." />`.** Don't import `.mdx` directly.
- **Icons are `astro-icon` + Phosphor**: `<Icon name="ph:<glyph>" />`, imported from
  `@cloudflare/nimbus-docs/components/Icon.astro` rather than `astro-icon/components`, which is not
  a dependency here. Glyphs: [phosphoricons.com](https://phosphoricons.com).
- **A `mode: custom` page gets a bare `<main>`** -- no sidebar, no TOC, and no `.docs-content`
  wrapper or width cap either, so its prose must be wrapped in `<Prose>` or it renders unstyled and
  edge to edge.
- **Never type the library's size into prose.** Write `%BUNDLE_SIZE%` and it is substituted from the
  measured value, in bodies and in frontmatter alike.
- **Don't remove `<AgentDirective />` from `BaseLayout.astro`.** It points agents at `/llms.txt`.

House style for the prose itself: no em dashes (` -- ` in text, which the markdown pipeline leaves
alone), every code fence gets a language, and no code block directly under an `##` heading -- say
what it is first.

## Adding things

| Goal                      | Action                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| New doc page              | `src/content/docs/<group>/<slug>.md`, with `sidebar.order`. The group autogenerates.                                   |
| New sidebar group         | A directory under `src/content/docs/` and an `autogenerate` entry in `astro.config.ts`.                                |
| Off-site sidebar link     | Give the group an `items:` array: `{ autogenerate }` first, then `{ label, link }`. Nimbus adds `target="_blank"`.     |
| New partial               | `src/content/partials/<slug>.mdx` (the collection is registered; there are none yet), then `<Render file="<slug>" />`. |
| UI from the registry      | `npx nimbus-docs add <slug>`, then register it in `src/components.ts` if MDX uses it.                                  |
| New playground example    | An entry in `src/examples.ts` (`files` and `build`), and a page under `src/content/docs/examples/`.                    |
| Custom page route         | A file under `src/pages/`.                                                                                             |
| OG card restyle           | `src/pages/og/_og-card-config.ts`.                                                                                     |
| Check it builds           | `npx nimbus-docs check` -- build-free preflight. `--json` for an agent loop, `--fix` to repair what's safe.            |
| Check for updates         | `npx nimbus-docs outdated` -- starter files behind their tag, registry components behind.                              |
| Review an upstream change | `npx nimbus-docs diff <file>`, then `diff --apply <file>`.                                                             |
| Update a registry item    | `npx nimbus-docs add <slug> --overwrite`, then read `git diff`.                                                        |

`npx nimbus-docs list` shows what is installable.

Ten starter files are modified here, so `diff --apply` wants review rather than a blind apply: the
two layouts, `[...slug].astro`, `404.astro`, `components.ts`, `content.config.ts`, `globals.css`,
the OG config, `tsconfig.json`, and `index.mdx`. `README.md` says why for each.

Two registry components are modified too, so `add --overwrite` will silently undo the changes.
`breadcrumbs/Breadcrumbs.astro` and `page-actions/PageActions.astro` shipped their separators as
`text-muted-foreground/50` and `/40`. The alpha modifier is the `opacity` sin by another name -- the
breadcrumb `/` measured 2.19:1 in light -- so the breadcrumb separators inherit
`text-muted-foreground` from the `<ol>` (6.22:1 light) and the page-action divider sits at `/70`,
which is 3.21:1 light and 5.38:1 dark: past the 3:1 line for a graphical object, still visibly
quieter than the buttons it separates.

`PageActions.astro` also pins the "Updated" date to `config.locale` and `timeZone: "UTC"`. It
formatted with an `undefined` locale in the build machine's zone, and this is a static site, so the
string was whatever the builder's environment happened to be: the same commit renders `Aug 11, 2026`
here, `12. Aug. 2026` under `de_DE`/`Asia/Tokyo`, and `2026年8月12日` under `ja_JP`. Note the day
moves too, because the timestamp is a real instant from `git log %at`.

## Audit this site

Start with `npx nimbus-docs check --json`. It runs the environment, structural, authoring, and type
checks build-free -- config validity, `site` placeholder, route collisions, MDX component
resolution, the lint rules, and a `tsc` type-check -- and returns three top-level signals plus
per-scope detail:

- **`status`** (`passed` | `failed` | `partial`) and **`readiness`** (`buildable` | `blocked` |
  `unknown`) are the primary signals. `status` is the whole-run verdict; `readiness` answers "does
  env + structure say it builds?". `ok` (=== zero errors) is kept for back-compat only.
- **`findings[{scope,code,severity,file,line,message,fixable,fix}]`** are problems we evaluated.
  Apply each `fix` (or `check --fix`).
- **`scopes[].notes[{code,reason,requiresBuild?,requiresInput?}]`** are checks we *couldn't*
  evaluate yet (e.g. types before a build). A note is never a finding and never carries a `fix` --
  you resolve it by making the missing thing exist (usually a build), not by `--fix`.
  `summary.notes` counts them.

Loop terminates on `status !== "failed" && summary.fixable === 0` -- a `partial` run with nothing
left to fix is a **stop** (optionally build, then re-check), not a `--fix` retry. Exit is `1` only
when `status` is `"failed"`. For full coverage (types + link-checking) run a build first, then
`check` again.

Only two authoring rules are errors here (`nimbus/frontmatter-shape`, `nimbus/internal-link`); the
rest are off because the repo already lints markdown at the root. Then walk these categories for
what `check` doesn't cover:

- **Config** -- `astro.config.ts` calls `nimbus(defineNimbusConfig({ ... }))`; `site` is set;
  `editPattern` contains `{path}`; `output:` matches the deploy target.
- **Content** -- `content.config.ts` registers `docsCollection()` and `partialsCollection()`; every
  `.mdx` is inside a registered collection; frontmatter validates.
- **Sidebar** -- every group in the config resolves to a directory with pages in it; no orphans; no
  slug collisions.
- **MDX** -- every PascalCase component in `*.mdx` is registered; every `<Render file=...>`
  resolves; code-fence languages are valid.
- **Routes** -- `llms.txt.ts`, `robots.txt.ts`, `[...slug]/index.md.ts`, `og.png.ts`,
  `og/[...slug].ts` all exist.
- **Registry hygiene** -- every `src/components/ui/<slug>/` is either MDX-registered or imported in
  `src/`; transitive deps (`lib/cn.ts`) exist.
- **AI surface** -- `<AgentDirective />` renders in `BaseLayout.astro`; doc `<head>` has
  `<link rel="alternate" type="text/markdown" ...>`.
- **Search** -- `data-pagefind-body` is on the docs main wrapper; after a build, `dist/pagefind/`
  exists with at least one indexed page.
- **Cloudflare** -- `wrangler.jsonc` has `name`, `compatibility_date`,
  `assets.directory = "./dist"`, `not_found_handling`.
- **Dead CSS** -- a selector that matches nothing on any page is usually a rule left pointing at a
  vendor the site no longer uses. That is how the playground's Expressive Code rules were found.

Emit findings as `- [error|warn|info] FILE:LINE -- what + why + fix.` and end with
`Summary: N errors, N warnings.`

## Don't

- Hand-add a component under `src/components/ui/` that the registry already has -- use
  `nimbus-docs add` so its dependencies come with it.
- Import `.mdx` files directly. Use `<Render file="..." />`.
- Attach remark/rehype plugins via `mdx({ remarkPlugins })`: Sätteri silently drops them.
  Markdown transformations go in `markdown.mdastPlugins` / `hastPlugins`, and a Sätteri plugin is a
  visitor over read-only nodes that writes through `context.setProperty`.
- Edit `src/components.ts` to bypass registration. If MDX uses a component, register it.
- Spend the orange accent on anything else. It is the call to action and almost nothing else --
  prose links are ink, not accent -- and that restraint is the point.
- Darken, tint or theme-swap `--cw-orange`. It is Cloudflare orange, `#f6821f`, the brand's value
  and not ours to adjust, and it is the same hex on both schemes. The text on it inverts instead,
  via `--nb-background`. That pairing is a **sanctioned exception to the site's AA rule** in light
  mode -- 2.28:1, against 7.67:1 dark -- and it was chosen over compliance on purpose. Don't "fix"
  it. Two narrower places do use a darkened variant, for reasons that do not generalise:
  `--cw-orange-text`, because the brand orange as prose on paper is 2.3:1 and simply unreadable;
  and the playground's light-mode `--pg-accent`, because that one is the only cue for which tab is
  active and the brand orange is 2.11:1 on its bar, under even the 3:1 a control needs.
- Assume the landing page is dark. It was, and is not any more -- it honours the toggle like every
  other page, and the hero figure reads its colours from the same tokens as the prose.
  `.cw-home` marks the page, not a scheme.
- Treat the hero figure as decoration. It is the page's argument, in the flow, at full contrast, so
  its text is type: contrast-measured in both schemes, never dimmed with `globalAlpha`, and carried
  in words by the `sr-only` `<figcaption>` that `CanvasFigure.astro` requires as a prop. Any number
  the scene draws has to match the caption in `lib/hero-copy.ts`, and nothing checks that for you.
- Freeze a reduced-motion still on a moment rather than composing one. A still is the only frame
  some visitors ever see, so it has to carry the whole argument. Watch for fades in particular: the
  figure once froze at the exact instant its slow verdict began fading in, so the number it exists
  to show was painted at `globalAlpha` 0. Pixel and screenshot checks cannot see that -- assert on
  the draw calls, and treat anything drawn at alpha 0 in a still as a bug.
- Size the figure's layout in breakpoints. Its margins are budgeted from the measured width of the
  strings that go in them, which is why shortening one label narrowed the whole middle of the
  figure. A width threshold cannot see what is beside a rail: the first cut used one and ran the
  call labels straight through an axis tick at 900px.
- Judge the figure by its painted percentage. `painted > 0` says nothing about whether the thing
  drew what it meant to. Check the scene's own draw calls.
- Dim text with `opacity` to make it secondary. `--nb-muted-foreground` is already that, measured;
  multiplying it by 0.6 is how the figure captions ended up the least readable text on the site.
  Tailwind's alpha modifier is the same sin with better manners: `text-muted-foreground/50` is not a
  colour choice, it is 2.19:1.
- Set the wordmark as live `<text>`, or hand-edit `logo-paths.ts`. It is generated by
  `scripts/build-wordmark.mjs`; change the tilt, size, tracking or jitter there and regenerate. A
  logo that falls back to Georgia is not the logo.
- Swap the wordmark's face to URW Bookman because it is already installed and is what the
  reference uses. It is AGPL-3 and its font exception covers only Postscript and PDF, not SVG.
  TeX Gyre Bonum Bold is the same Bookman design under the GUST Font License.
- Merge the wordmark's per-glyph paths into one path per line. The fill then floods their union
  and swallows the keyline wherever two letters touch.
- Theme the mark, or the seal's *fill*. The mark is fixed in both schemes -- white fill, black
  keyline -- and the seal is always Cloudflare orange, because they are stamped objects rather than
  page furniture. The seal's **legend** is the one exception: it takes `--nb-background`, so the
  words invert with the scheme like paper showing through a punched hole, and the README banner
  knocks them out of the star with a `<mask>` to get the same effect for real. That costs contrast
  in light mode (2.28:1, against 7.67:1 dark) and is accepted. Don't "fix" it by darkening the
  orange; read the note in `StarBadge.astro` first.
- Take the seal's invisible `background` off `.cw-star-text`. It is the same orange it sits on, and
  it exists so contrast tools measure the real pair instead of walking past the SVG to the page.
- Regularise the wordmark's per-glyph jitter. The `rot`/`dy`/`scale` arrays are measured off the
  reference, not decoration: a hand-set mark is what is being parodied, and zeroing them makes it
  visibly deader.
- Soften the hero banner's bottom edge. It ends on a hard line because a cereal box is printed
  rather than blended, and the seal crossing that line is what stops the band reading as a floating
  slab. Nothing from the banner down may set `overflow: hidden`.
- Thin the wordmark's keyline, or lighten the band expecting the white fill to survive it. The band
  is one translucent value (`--cw-band`) over whatever page shows it, so on light it is a pale wash
  and the white mark measures 1.56:1 against it on average, 1.23:1 at its lightest. On light the
  keyline *is* the logo; on dark the fill does the work at 15.45:1. The lever for a genuinely pale
  treatment is `--cw-mark-fill`, which inverts the mark to a black fill and is a different logo
  rather than a lighter one.
- Lower `.cw-hero-lockup`'s `max-width` to shrink the mark on a phone. That is the `min(100%, cap)`
  branch that is not taken there; the band's inline padding is what sets the size below 48rem.
- Straighten the mark's left nudge because the artwork looks centred without it. The nudge offsets
  the seal's visual weight, which hangs off the right and is not in the mark's box at all.
- Resize either line of the lockup without re-checking the clearance the build prints. `LEAD` is a
  multiple of the lower line's cap height, so changing `size` moves the leading with it, and the
  reference's range is 17-34px.
- Hide the hero seal with `display: none` below `34rem`. Its legend is the page's `<h1>`, so it is
  hidden the `sr-only` way and the heading survives in the outline and the accessibility tree.
  Pick `34rem` over a new number if you move it: `Features.astro` already breaks there.
- Re-express the hero seal's overhang as a fraction of the seal. `--cw-seal-overhang` is a length
  because that is what the eye reads, and because a fraction means every resize of the seal moves
  it without anyone asking. The seal's `top` is derived from the overhang, not the reverse.
- Tilt the seal as a whole. `--cw-star-tilt` belongs on `.cw-star-shape` so the legend stays level
  and `.cw-star`'s layout box stays measurable; rotating the wrapper inflates its bounding box by
  17% and every harness then has to divide that back out.
- Replace `--cw-hero-nudge`'s clamp with a constant. The nudge only fits where the lockup has hit
  its cap and left slack beside it; a fixed value walks the mark off the left edge of a phone.
- Point the favicon at the hero's 20-point star. It is a separate 11-point star at a deeper 0.55
  ratio because the seal's own geometry turns into a fuzzy disc at tab size, and its fill is a
  literal hex -- a favicon is its own document and inherits no custom properties.
- Reach for `--cw-mark-fill` / `--cw-mark-stroke` to recolour the wordmark. They exist so the
  header can drop to a one-colour silhouette at 40px, where the keyline is a third of a pixel and
  renders as haze. A differently coloured stamp is a different decision; make it deliberately.
- Try to size `Wordmark.astro` or `StarBadge.astro` from a parent's scoped CSS. Astro stamps a
  child's root element with the *child's* scope hash, so the rule silently matches nothing. Size
  the wrapper the parent owns and let the svg fill it. Custom properties do inherit through.
- Remove `.cw-hero-lede` or `.cw-hero-actions` because nothing styles them. They are measurement
  hooks for the hero's vertical rhythm, which is a claim `/tmp/opencode/vgaps.mjs` checks.
- Remove `<AgentDirective />` unless asked.
