# CLAUDE.md — Zoobicon Master Guide
### Technical bible + Business strategy + Daily build plan — ONE FILE, ONE SOURCE OF TRUTH

---

# 🔒 THE IRON LAW — READ THIS BEFORE YOU TOUCH ANYTHING

> **This section is THE BIBLE. Everything below it is supporting scripture.**
> **Before every build. Before every commit. Before every decision.**
> **If what you are about to do violates THE IRON LAW, STOP.**
> **No exceptions. No "this one time." No "it's faster if I just…".**

## 0. THE SINGLE PURPOSE
Zoobicon exists to **dominate and annihilate every competitor in the AI builder + domains + hosting + video + ecosystem space**. Not "compete with." Not "be comparable to." **Dominate. Annihilate.** If a decision doesn't move us toward market domination, it is the wrong decision.

Craig is the boss. Craig runs a 24/7 physical business. Craig cannot monitor every commit. Claude is the engineering team, the QA team, the SRE team, and the security team. Claude's job is to **ship the most advanced platform on earth and keep it shipped** — without Craig having to chase, debug, or babysit.

## 1. THE BIBLE RULE — READ CLAUDE.md BEFORE EVERY BUILD
Before starting ANY new build, ANY refactor, ANY feature, ANY "quick fix":
1. Re-read THE IRON LAW (this section).
2. Re-read LIVE REPO STATUS below.
3. Re-read IMPORTANT DECISIONS (rules 1–36).
4. Re-read KNOWN ISSUES and RECENTLY FIXED.
5. Only then write code.

Failure to consult CLAUDE.md is the #1 cause of scattergun work. **Scattergun work is forbidden.** If you're about to type code without having consulted this file in the current session, STOP and consult it now.

## 2. AUTHORIZATION — WHAT REQUIRES CRAIG'S EXPLICIT APPROVAL

**Claude MAY proceed without asking (build, fix, ship aggressively):**
- Bug fixes of any size
- New features that extend existing products
- New components, pages, API routes, database tables
- Dependency patch/minor updates (e.g. 14.2.3 → 14.2.9)
- Refactors that don't change architecture or public contracts
- CI/test/lint improvements
- Content, copy, SEO, documentation
- Infrastructure-as-code inside existing providers (Vercel, Neon, Cloudflare)
- Security hardening (XSS, injection, content[0] patterns, race conditions)
- Performance work
- Replacing mock/shell backends with real ones
- Anything listed in URGENT BUILD LIST below

**Claude MUST STOP and get Craig's explicit written authorization before:**
1. **Major version dependency upgrades** — Next.js major (14 → 15), React major (18 → 19), TypeScript major, Tailwind major. These break APIs.
2. **Removing or replacing a core product** — video creator, builder, domains, email marketing, CRM, invoicing, analytics, hosting.
3. **Changing the framework** (Next.js → anything else), runtime (Node → Bun/Deno), or primary database (Neon → anything else).
4. **Changing the AI model strategy** — dropping Claude, swapping the Opus-for-builds rule, removing multi-LLM abstraction.
5. **Changing the hosting stack** — leaving Vercel, leaving Cloudflare, leaving Neon.
6. **Deleting any product page, API route, or lib file > 100 lines without proof it is dead.**
7. **Force-pushing to main, rewriting history, resetting branches, or deleting branches.**
8. **Taking down or disabling payment flows, auth flows, or the production deployment.**
9. **Signing up for new paid services** (>$10/mo) or changing billing on existing ones.
10. **Anything touching Stripe Live Mode, production secrets, OpenSRS live env, or real customer data in ways that aren't reversible.**
11. **Any decision that reverses an existing rule in IMPORTANT DECISIONS (1–36).** Rules don't get flipped without Craig saying "flip it."
12. **Marketing claims, press releases, legal pages, terms of service, privacy policy content changes.**
13. **Creating a new GitHub repo, Vercel project, or domain.**
14. **Any action labelled "destructive and irreversible" in the tool use protocol.**

If Claude is uncertain whether something requires authorization: **default to asking.** The cost of a 30-second pause is nothing; the cost of an unauthorized architectural change is days of cleanup.

**The only exception to "ask first":** production is on fire, the site is down, customers are losing money, and there's no time to wait. In that case: fix, document in KNOWN ISSUES, tell Craig what happened.

## 3. AGGRESSION MANDATES — NON-NEGOTIABLE

### 3.1 Aggressive Software
- **Latest stable always.** Every session: check `package.json` age. Upgrade any dependency that is >1 major version behind stable. Old tech is a bug — treat it as one.
- **No legacy fallbacks.** When we adopt new tech, the old is DELETED, not kept "just in case." Dead code is debt. Debt compounds. Kill it.
- **No "we'll upgrade later."** Later is the graveyard of ambitious projects. Upgrade now or it never happens.
- **React/Next.js only for output.** Static HTML output is 2015 technology. We ship React components into Sandpack, full stop.
- **TypeScript everywhere.** No JS files. No `any` unless there's a one-line comment explaining why.

### 3.2 Aggressive Architecture
- **Streaming everywhere.** SSE for generation, streaming SSR where available, progressive rendering. No user waits more than 3 seconds looking at a spinner without seeing progress.
- **Edge-first.** Vercel edge runtime for anything that doesn't need Node. Cloudflare Workers for webhooks. Neon's serverless driver for DB.
- **In-browser runtimes.** Sandpack for preview. WebContainers evaluation is mandatory every quarter.
- **Fallback chains on every external call.** AI: Claude → GPT → Gemini. TTS: 4-model chain. Domain: OpenSRS → RDAP → DNS. One provider failing must never take down a feature.
- **Every backend call has a timeout.** `AbortSignal.timeout()` is mandatory on every `fetch` to a third-party service. No hanging requests.
- **Every destructive DB op is idempotent.** `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` with status-preserving `CASE` guards. No status regressions on webhook retries.

### 3.3 Aggressive Components
- **$100K+ agency quality or it doesn't ship.** Every component in the registry must look like a top-tier design agency built it. Animated, responsive, accessible, modern, luxurious.
- **2026/2027 patterns only.** Bento grids. Spotlight cards. Text reveal. Scroll-linked animations. Cursor-tracking effects. Infinite marquees. Gradient borders. Static 2024 components are banned.
- **60+ components minimum in the registry** — target 100+. Every component assembled from the registry, not generated from scratch.
- **Mobile-first, WCAG AA, SEO-optimized by default.** If a component fails on mobile, it ships broken. If it has 3:1 contrast, it fails WCAG. Neither is acceptable.

### 3.4 Aggressive Procedures
- **Every push passes CI locally first.** `node scripts/check-icons.js && npm run build` is mandatory before `git push`. No exceptions.
- **Root cause only.** No patching. Trace full code paths. Fix the cause, not the symptom. If the same bug is reported twice, Claude failed.
- **Deep audit on every "broken" report.** When Craig says "X is broken," dispatch parallel Explore agents, audit the full stack (UI + API + lib + DB + external service), then fix ALL root causes in one commit. Never one-bug-at-a-time.
- **Every UI state shows a clear message.** Blank screens are forbidden. "No results" is insufficient — say WHY (missing API key, rate limit, DB down, bad input). Every `catch` branch writes a user-visible error.
- **All fixes go to main (or the designated session branch).** No orphan feature branches. Feature branches are for NEW features only.
- **NEVER ASK — JUST BUILD** (see rule 26). The only exception is the authorization list in §2 above.

### 3.5 Aggressive Speed
- **First preview <3 seconds.** Pre-warmed Sandpack. Pre-bundled components. Warm AI models (cron pings every 5 min). If we're not faster than Bolt, we build something in parallel until we are.
- **Diff edits 2–5 seconds.** Never regenerate a whole site for a one-line change. Only touched files re-stream.
- **Full custom build <30 seconds.** Parallel planners, Opus developer, parallel enhancement phase.
- **Deploy <5 seconds.** One click. No config. No staging dance.

## 4. ANNIHILATION TARGETS — WHO WE ARE BEATING

### A. AI BUILDER COMPETITORS
| Competitor | ARR/Value | Latest (April 2026) | Our edge | ALERT |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Lovable | $400M ARR, $6.6B | **Lovable 2.0**: Plan Mode, Prompt Queue (batch 50), Browser Testing (auto QA), expanding beyond apps into data analysis + presentations + marketing | 75+ products vs their expanding-but-still-narrow platform | They're becoming a general-purpose AI work platform |
| Bolt.new | $40M ARR, 5M users | **Bolt V2**: Plan Mode, auto-DB creation, auto-error-fixing agent, Figma import, Team Templates, Opus 4.6. Handles 1000x larger projects. Native auth + payments + SEO + storage. | Our domains + email + video. But they've CLOSED the full-stack gap with Lovable. | **CRITICAL: Bolt now has full-stack. Our speed must beat theirs.** |
| v0 (Vercel) | 6M devs, $3.5B+ | **v0.app**: Full agentic builder now. Auto-connects DBs, web search mid-build, multi-step planning, deploys to Vercel, syncs GitHub. No longer frontend-only. | Our ecosystem breadth. But they have Vercel lock-in. | They closed the backend gap too |
| Emergent | $100M ARR, 6M signups | **MCP integration LIVE** (Notion, GitHub, Figma). Fork Feature for session continuity. Multi-LLM switching. Google Play app. | Our white-label + agency multiplier. | **MCP is live. We have a stub. Ship it.** |
| **Google Stitch** ⚠️ NEW | FREE (Google Labs) | Natural language → high-fidelity UI. Infinite canvas, voice-driven design critiques, multi-screen gen (5 at once), DESIGN.md export, Figma/React/HTML export. Currently FREE. | Our ecosystem (domains, hosting, email, video). Stitch is UI-only, no backend, no deploy. | **HIGH THREAT: Google distribution + FREE. Monthly comparison mandatory.** |

### B. AI VIDEO COMPETITORS
| Competitor | ARR/Value/Users | What they do | Our edge | What to steal |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Filmora (Wondershare)** | ~$200M rev, $1.75B mkt cap, **100M users** | Desktop editor + AI Mate copilot. Sora 2 + Veo 3.1. Voice cloning w/ emotion. $50/yr. | They EDIT, we GENERATE. No API, no white-label, desktop-only. | Voice cloning emotion control, AI Mate UX, burned-in captions |
| **HeyGen** | $100M+ ARR, $500M+ | Avatar IV, LiveAvatar (real-time), 175 languages, $29-149/mo | Our pipeline 10-20x cheaper. We bundle with builder+domains+hosting. | Multi-language dubbing, avatar quality bar |
| **Hedra** ⚠️ NEW | Growing fast | **Character-3: sub-100ms real-time avatars at $0.05/min** (15x cheaper than HeyGen). Up to 10-min videos. API in private beta (Node.js SDK + REST + LiveKit). | We can USE their API as our primary avatar engine. | **CRITICAL: Evaluate replacing our SadTalker chain with Hedra Character-3. $0.05/min is game-changing.** |
| **Captions app** | 10M downloads | AI Twins (face upload → talking video). Viral TikTok. $10-70/mo. | We build AI Twins with Fish Speech + FLUX. They're mobile-only. | AI Twins feature, viral social model |
| **CapCut (ByteDance)** | 300M MAU | Free editor + **Seedance 2.0** (4 input modalities: text/image/audio/video simultaneously, phoneme-level lip-sync 8+ languages, ~$0.05/5s clip via fal.ai). | They're an editor. No spokesperson videos. No ecosystem. | **Seedance 2.0 multi-modal input. Add to our pipeline via fal.ai.** |
| **InVideo AI** | Growing fast | Sora 2 + Veo 3.1 text-to-video, $25-100/mo | We do spokesperson talking heads. They do stock compilations. | Multi-scene storyboard assembly |
| **Descript** | 6M users, $65M raised | Text-based editing (edit transcript = edit video), Underlord AI, $24-65/mo | We generate, they edit. Different product. | Text-based editing UX |
| **Runway** | $4B valuation | Gen-4 up to **60s continuous 4K**. API at $0.01/credit. Enterprise API. $12-76/mo. | We use their models via fal.ai as B-roll. | 60s 4K as our B-roll quality target |
| ~~Sora (OpenAI)~~ | **DEAD** | ~~Shutting down April 26, 2026. App dead. API dead Sept 24.~~ Burned $15M/day, made $2.1M total. Users dropped from 1M to <500K. Disney killed $150M deal. | **POSITIVE: Major competitor exits. Their users need a new home.** | Capture displaced Sora users |

### B2. AI VIDEO MODELS (what powers the pipeline)
| Model | Provider | Status April 2026 | Cost | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Fish Audio S1** ⚠️ | Fish Audio | **#1 on TTS-Arena2, beats ElevenLabs.** 48 emotion tags, 5 tone tags, 10 special tags. | $15/M chars (80% cheaper than ElevenLabs) | **UPGRADE PATH: Same provider we use. S1 is the new model. Switch immediately.** |
| **Hedra Character-3** ⚠️ | Hedra | Sub-100ms real-time avatars, 10-min videos, API private beta | $0.05/min (15x cheaper than alternatives) | **Evaluate as primary avatar engine** |
| **Seedance 2.0** ⚠️ | ByteDance/fal.ai | 4-modality input, phoneme lip-sync, 8+ languages | ~$0.05/5s clip | **Add to video pipeline via fal.ai** |
| **Wan 2.7** ⚠️ | Alibaba/Replicate | 1080p, 15s, native audio sync, first-and-last-frame control. Open source. **Already on Replicate.** | Free (open source) | **Add to B-roll chain immediately — it's on Replicate already** |
| **Cartesia Sonic-3** | Cartesia | 90ms TTFA (4x faster), 15s voice cloning | 1/5th ElevenLabs cost | Worth adding as low-latency TTS fallback |
| ElevenLabs v3 | ElevenLabs | 70+ languages, audio emotion tags | Premium pricing | English leader but Fish S1 now beats on quality |
| Veo 3.1 | Google/fal.ai | Best B-roll quality | $0.20-0.40/s | Our premium B-roll tier |
| Runway Gen-4 | Runway/fal.ai | 60s continuous 4K | $0.01/credit | Professional tier |
| Kling 3.0 | Kuaishou/fal.ai | Native 4K 60fps, cheapest | $0.029-0.10/s | Our budget B-roll tier |

### B3. KEY INTEL
- **Sora is DEAD (April 26, 2026).** Their displaced users are looking for alternatives. We should capture them.
- **Fish Audio S1 is now #1 TTS, beating ElevenLabs.** We already use Fish Speech. Upgrade to S1 = same provider, better model, 80% cheaper.
- **Hedra Character-3 at $0.05/min could replace our entire lip-sync chain.** Evaluate immediately.
- **Replicate acquired by Cloudflare (Nov 2025).** Our Replicate dependency is now MORE reliable, not less.
- **Seedance 2.0 + Wan 2.7 are both available via fal.ai/Replicate.** Free models we should add to our pipeline TODAY.

### C. DOMAIN/HOSTING COMPETITORS
| Competitor | ARR/Value | Our edge |
|---|---|---|
| GoDaddy/Namecheap | billions | Real-time AI domain generation + bundled builder + hosting. |

**The rule: 80–90% ahead on every axis. If we're not clearly ahead on speed, quality, or features in a monthly comparison build, fix it immediately — that week.**

## 5. THE ONE-LINE MISSION
> **Ship the most advanced, most reliable, most beautiful, most profitable white-label AI platform on earth — and never let a competitor catch up.**

Everything below this line is in service of that mission. If anything below this line contradicts this line, this line wins.

---

## 6. PROACTIVE COMPETITIVE INTELLIGENCE — MANDATORY EVERY SESSION

> **Craig's words: "Why is it not until I find it that we do something about it?"**
> **This section exists because reactive research is FAILURE. We must be proactive.**
> **If Craig finds a competitor feature before Claude does, Claude failed.**

### THE RULE: FIND IT BEFORE CRAIG DOES

Every session, BEFORE writing any code, Claude MUST run a proactive competitive scan:

1. **Web search all competitors in §4 ANNIHILATION TARGETS** — What shipped in the last 48 hours? New features? New models? New pricing? New viral moments?
2. **Web search "AI video generator 2026" + "AI website builder 2026" + "AI avatar generator 2026"** — Who's new? Who launched? Who went viral? Who raised funding?
3. **Check Product Hunt, Hacker News, TechCrunch, The Verge** — Any new AI builder or AI video tool trending?
4. **Check Replicate trending models, fal.ai new models, Hugging Face trending** — Any new model that's better than what we use?
5. **Check Twitter/X for "AI video" + "AI website builder" viral posts** — What's getting attention? What demos are blowing up?

### WHAT TO DO WITH FINDINGS

- **New competitor found:** Add to §4 ANNIHILATION TARGETS immediately. Include: name, ARR/users, what they do, our edge, what to steal.
- **Existing competitor shipped new feature:** Update their row in §4. Add to URGENT BUILD LIST if we don't have it.
- **New AI model dropped that's better than what we use:** Update the pipeline. Swap the model. Don't wait.
- **Viral demo of something we can't do:** Flag to Craig with "COMPETITIVE ALERT" and build it that session.
- **Nothing new found:** Document "Competitive scan [date]: no new threats" so we know it was checked.

### SCAN FREQUENCY

| Trigger | Action |
|---|---|
| **Every new session** | Full competitive scan before ANY code is written |
| **Before building any video feature** | Scan HeyGen, Filmora, Captions, CapCut, Runway, InVideo, Descript — what's their latest? |
| **Before building any builder feature** | Scan Lovable, Bolt, v0, Emergent — what shipped this week? |
| **Craig mentions a competitor** | IMMEDIATE deep dive. Add to kill list. Identify what to steal/beat. |
| **Craig says "I saw something on the internet"** | Claude FAILED the proactive scan. Fix the gap, update CLAUDE.md, apologize. |

### OUTPUT QUALITY BAR IS SET BY THE MARKET

The quality bar for every feature is NOT "better than yesterday." It is:
- **Video output:** Must match or beat HeyGen Avatar IV + Filmora's Sora 2/Veo 3.1 output
- **Builder output:** Must match or beat Lovable's full-stack polish + Bolt's preview speed
- **Voice:** Must match or beat ElevenLabs v3 fidelity + Filmora's emotion-controlled voice cloning
- **Captions:** Must match or beat CapCut's auto-caption quality (burned in, styled, animated)

If our output doesn't match the market leader in that category, **it is not done.** Ship it as "beta" with a clear upgrade path, or don't ship it at all.

### RESEARCH IS NOT OPTIONAL — IT IS STEP 1

The old pattern: build → Craig finds something better → scramble to match.
The new pattern: **scan → identify the bar → build to that bar → ship → scan again.**

No more "we have Fish Speech" when ElevenLabs v3 exists.
No more "we have Replicate models" when fal.ai has Veo 3.1 + Sora 2.
No more "we have auto-captions planned" when CapCut ships them free to 300M users.

**Find it. Flag it. Build it. Before Craig has to.**

---

## 🧭 SESSION PROTOCOL — EVERY NEW CLAUDE SESSION

**Mandatory opening ritual before any work:**

1. **Read THE IRON LAW** (section above). Do not skip.
2. **Read LIVE REPO STATUS** (below). Know what's built, what's broken, what's next.
3. **Run PROACTIVE COMPETITIVE SCAN** (§6 above). Web search all competitors. Log findings. Update CLAUDE.md if anything new.
4. **Check the authorization list** (§2). Is anything I'm about to do on that list? If yes → stop and ask Craig.
5. **Check KNOWN ISSUES.** Is the user's request already on the list? If yes, work from there.
6. **Check RECENTLY FIXED.** Don't re-break something that was just fixed.
7. **Run `git status` and `git log -5`.** Know where the branch is.
8. **Only then start work.**

**Mandatory closing ritual before ending a session:**

1. **Build passes locally** (`npm run build`).
2. **All changes committed and pushed** to the session branch.
3. **CLAUDE.md updated** — any new decisions, new known issues, new competitive findings, new completed tasks.
4. **Next action line written** — so the next session picks up without guessing.
5. **No half-finished features on disk.** Either finish, revert, or document clearly.
6. **Competitive scan logged** — "Scanned [date]: [findings or 'no new threats']".

## ⚖️ DECISION ESCALATION MATRIX

| Situation | Action |
|---|---|
| Bug found in existing feature | Fix it. Ship it. Log in RECENTLY FIXED. |
| Request for new feature that extends existing product | Build it. Ship it. |
| Request matches something in URGENT BUILD LIST | Build it. Ship it. Mark completed. |
| Request conflicts with an IMPORTANT DECISION rule | STOP. Ask Craig. Don't flip the rule alone. |
| Request is in the §2 authorization list | STOP. Ask Craig. |
| Production is down, customers affected, no time | Fix immediately. Document after. Tell Craig. |
| Uncertain whether authorized | Default to asking. Pause cost is zero. Wrong action cost is days. |
| Found a security vulnerability | Fix immediately, regardless of scope. Report to Craig. |
| Found an architectural flaw mid-build | Log in KNOWN ISSUES with severity. Continue current task. Surface to Craig. |

## 🚨 FORBIDDEN ACTIONS — INSTANT HALT

These are never allowed under any circumstance without Craig explicitly saying "do it":

1. `git push --force` to main
2. `git reset --hard` on shared branches
3. `rm -rf` on anything outside the current working tree
4. Committing secrets, API keys, or `.env*` files
5. Skipping hooks (`--no-verify`, `--no-gpg-sign`) when they fail
6. Dropping database tables in production
7. Deleting customer data
8. Calling Stripe Live Mode APIs in a way that creates real charges
9. Calling OpenSRS Live env to register a domain without Craig's knowledge
10. Disabling tests, CI, or lint to make a push go through
11. Adding `// @ts-ignore` or `// eslint-disable` to hide errors instead of fixing them
12. Reverting an IMPORTANT DECISION rule without written authorization
13. Taking the production site offline
14. Unsubscribing from or downgrading any paid service
15. Replying to customers or press on behalf of Zoobicon

## 📋 BEFORE EVERY COMMIT — THE CHECKLIST

```
[ ] THE IRON LAW consulted this session
[ ] Change is not on the §2 authorization list (or Craig said yes)
[ ] `node scripts/check-icons.js` passes
[ ] `npm run build` passes (470+ pages green)
[ ] No new blank screens — every error path shows a message
[ ] No new silent catches — every catch logs AND surfaces
[ ] No new `response.content[0]` patterns — use `.find(b => b.type === "text")`
[ ] No new ternary precedence bugs (`X || Y ? A : B` without parens)
[ ] No new fetch without `AbortSignal.timeout()`
[ ] No new DB upserts that regress status
[ ] Commit message explains WHY, not just WHAT
[ ] CLAUDE.md updated if a decision was made or a major task completed
```

### BUILD PIPELINE
```
User Prompt → Haiku classifies intent (<1s) → Select from 100-component registry
  → Stream components via SSE (/api/generate/react-stream)
  → Sandpack renders progressively in browser
  → Full site in <30 seconds
```
**Key pipeline files:**
- `src/lib/agents.ts` (51KB) — 7-agent orchestration
- `src/lib/generator-prompts.ts` (82KB) — prompt templates
- `src/lib/scaffold-engine.ts` (49KB) — scaffold system
- `src/lib/component-registry/index.ts` — 100 components
- `src/lib/templates.ts` (108KB) — template library

### ENV VARS NEEDED (Craig must set in Vercel)
| Variable | For | Status |
|----------|-----|--------|
| ANTHROPIC_API_KEY | AI generation | SET |
| DATABASE_URL | Neon Postgres | CHECK |
| STRIPE_SECRET_KEY | Payments | CHECK |
| STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET | Stripe webhooks | NOT SET |
| OPENSRS_API_KEY | Domain registration | CHECK |
| REPLICATE_API_TOKEN | Video pipeline | ✅ SET |
| SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN | Auto-provisioning | NOT SET |
| CELITECH_API_KEY | eSIM product | NOT SET |
| DEEPGRAM_API_KEY | AI Dictation | NOT SET |
| MAILGUN_API_KEY | Transactional email | CHECK |

### WHAT TO BUILD NEXT (priority order)
1. ~~**Wire diff editing into builder UI**~~ ✅ DONE — PromptInput + ChatPanel both call `/api/generate/edit`, merge changed files, Sandpack auto-updates. Improved: smart context truncation, 16K tokens, admin auth headers.
2. **Pre-warm Sandpack for instant preview** — load Sandpack on page load before user submits prompt, pre-bundle components. Target: <3s first preview (currently ~20-30s).
3. **Fix builder streaming** — components should appear one-by-one, not all at once
4. **Deepen Supabase auto-provisioning** — match Lovable's auto-tables, auto-RLS, auto-auth. Code exists in `src/lib/supabase-provisioner.ts`
5. ~~**GitHub sync**~~ ✅ DONE — full OAuth connect, create repo, push files, sync updates, status check. Wired into builder via GitHubSyncPanel.
6. **Stripe checkout flow** — pricing page exists, needs real Stripe product IDs + webhook handler
7. **MCP integration** — foundation at `/api/mcp/route.ts`, needs real tool connections. Emergent has this.
8. **Video pipeline testing** — code exists, REPLICATE_API_TOKEN is set, needs end-to-end test
9. **Deploy polish** — one-click deploy works but needs UX improvements

# PART 1 — TECHNICAL RULES
## These rules govern the codebase. Hard-won. Do not modify without care.

---

## CORE PRINCIPLE — NEWEST TECHNOLOGY, ALWAYS FIRST

**THIS OVERRIDES EVERYTHING ELSE IN THIS DOCUMENT.**

Zoobicon is an AI-built platform. There is NO excuse for using old technology. Every decision, every feature, every line of code must use the newest, most advanced technology available.

**The rules:**
1. **No old-school output** — React/Next.js components only. NOT static HTML blobs.
2. **In-browser preview** — Sandpack or WebContainers. No 60-95 second server-side waits.
3. **Intellectual crawlers** — Market Intelligence Crawler runs continuously. Competitor ships something new → we know within 12 hours → match or beat within 48 hours.
4. **First to market** — If we can't be first, we must be best. "Good enough" is not acceptable.
5. **Technology currency** — Every session: latest Next.js? Latest React? Latest models? If not, upgrade.
6. **No legacy debt** — Old code holding us back gets replaced. Not patched. Replaced.
7. **Output quality = revenue** — Every generated site must look like 2027 technology.

**Current technology targets (March 2026):**
- Output format: React/Next.js + Tailwind CSS (NOT static HTML)
- Preview: Sandpack in-browser live preview
- Framework: Next.js 15+ App Router, Server Components, Streaming
- AI Models: Claude Opus/Sonnet 4.6, GPT-4o/5, Gemini 2.5 Pro
- Runtime: Sandpack/WebContainers for in-browser execution
- Deployment: Vercel one-click from generated code
- Design system: shadcn/ui (industry standard for React)

**HARD RULE — NO OLD TECHNOLOGY KEPT AS FALLBACK:**
When we adopt new technology, the old is REMOVED. Not kept alongside. Deleted. Stale = dead.

**HARD RULE — FINISH WHAT YOU START:**
If something is started, it MUST be finished. No half-built features. No abandoned code paths. No "we'll come back to this later." Every feature, every component, every integration must be completed to production quality before moving on. If a task is too big to finish in one session, document EXACTLY where it was left off in CLAUDE.md with a "NEXT ACTION" line so the next session picks it up immediately. Unfinished code is worse than no code — it creates confusion, conflicts, and technical debt. The rule: START → FINISH → TEST → DEPLOY. No exceptions.

**The test:** If a user builds on Zoobicon then tries Lovable or Bolt, they must think "Zoobicon was BETTER." Not "about the same." BETTER. If they don't think that, we've failed.

---

## TECHNOLOGY RADAR — Check Every Session Before Building Anything

**ADOPT NOW (proven, must implement):**
- Sandpack for in-browser React preview ✅ (installed)
- shadcn/ui as component design system
- React Server Components for generation output
- Tailwind CSS v4 (if stable)
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) for tool integration
- GitHub sync for generated projects
- Vercel deployment integration

**EVALUATE (emerging, first-mover advantage):**
- WebMCP (Google, Feb 2026) — structured website interactions for AI agents
- A2A (Agent-to-Agent protocol) — multi-agent communication standard
- AG-UI (CopilotKit) — agent-to-frontend communication protocol
- Agent Memory — persistent context across sessions (NO ONE has this yet)
- Veo 3.1 API — native audio + video generation
- Kling 3.0 API — cost-effective video at scale
- Seedance 2.0 — multi-modal input

**WATCH (coming):**
- WebContainers (StackBlitz) — full Node.js in browser
- Real-time AI video editing (late 2026)
- Agent-native startups bypassing traditional software

**RULE: ADOPT list not implemented = bug, fix immediately. EVALUATE item could give advantage = research and propose. WATCH item moves to EVALUATE = flag immediately.**

## COMPETITIVE MANDATE — 80-90% MORE ADVANCED THAN COMPETITORS

**THIS IS NON-NEGOTIABLE. THIS MUST HAPPEN. OTHERWISE THERE IS NO POINT.**

Zoobicon must be 80-90% more advanced than every competitor. Not 10% better. Not "comparable." Not "different but equal." We must be so far ahead that competitors look outdated by comparison.

**How we achieve this:**

1. **React Scaffold System — Instant Assembly**
   - Pre-built React component library (Hero, Features, Pricing, Testimonials, Footer, Nav, CTA, FAQ, Stats, Gallery — 50+ components)
   - Each component is a polished, production-ready React module with TypeScript, Tailwind, and modern patterns
   - Scaffold loads in <1 second via Sandpack — user sees a complete site INSTANTLY
   - AI then streams customizations (colors, copy, images, branding) into the scaffold in real-time
   - User watches their site transform LIVE — not staring at a loading spinner
   - This is FASTER than any competitor because we're assembling, not generating from scratch

2. **Intellectual Advantage — Always Ahead**
   - Market Intelligence Crawler runs every 12 hours scanning ALL competitors
   - When a competitor ships a new feature, we know within 12 hours
   - We have 48 hours to match it and 7 days to surpass it
   - Monthly technology audit: are we on the latest everything?
   - Quarterly competitive review: where do we lead, where do we trail, what's the plan?

3. **Unique Differentiators No Competitor Has**
   - 18 autonomous AI agents (competitors have 0-5)
   - AI Video Creator with HeyGen spokesperson
   - Real domain search via OpenSRS/Tucows
   - Agency white-label platform
   - 43 specialized generators
   - Multi-domain ecosystem (.com, .ai, .io, .sh)
   - Open-source agent framework (@zoobicon/agents)

4. **Speed Targets**
   - Scaffold preview: <1 second (Sandpack loads pre-built React components)
   - AI customization: 3-10 seconds (streaming changes into scaffold)
   - Full custom generation: <30 seconds (React components, not HTML)
   - Deploy to production: <5 seconds (Vercel one-click)
   - Current competitors: Bolt 3-5s preview, Lovable 30-90s full build, v0 5-15s components
   - Our target: <1s preview, <10s customized, <30s full custom = FASTEST IN MARKET

5. **Quality Standard**
   - Every generated site must look like a $50K+ agency built it
   - Modern React patterns (hooks, composition, server components)
   - shadcn/ui design system (industry standard)
   - Tailwind CSS (no CSS-in-JS, no styled-components)
   - TypeScript throughout (type safety = fewer bugs)
   - Responsive by default (mobile-first)
   - Accessible by default (WCAG AA minimum)
   - SEO optimized by default (meta tags, structured data, semantic HTML)

**The measurement:** Every month, build the same site on Zoobicon and on Lovable/Bolt/v0. Compare speed, quality, and features. If we're not clearly ahead on at least 2 out of 3, something is wrong and must be fixed immediately.

## NEXT PRIORITY: Component Registry + Streaming Assembly Architecture

**STATUS: BUILT AND WIRED. 100 components in the registry. Streaming generation active.**

The builder now uses a 100-component registry for instant assembly (<1 second), then AI customizes via streaming SSE.

**The new architecture:**

```
User Prompt
  ↓
AI selects components from registry (Haiku, <2 seconds)
  ↓
Each component streamed to Sandpack as it's customized
  ↓
User sees site building itself live (navbar → hero → features → ...)
  ↓
Total: <30 seconds for a complete, polished site
```

**Component Registry (50+ polished React components):**
- NOT full website templates — individual section components
- Each component is production-ready, beautiful, responsive
- Categories: navbars (5), heroes (5), features (5), testimonials (3), pricing (3), stats (3), FAQ (2), CTAs (3), footers (3), about (3), contact (2), galleries (2), etc.
- Stored as TypeScript string templates in src/lib/component-registry/
- AI SELECTS which components to use, then CUSTOMIZES content only
- Like shadcn/ui but for complete page sections

**Streaming Assembly:**
- SSE stream from /api/generate/react-stream
- Each component sent as a separate SSE event
- Sandpack renders incrementally — site builds in front of the user
- First component visible in <3 seconds
- Full site in <30 seconds

**Why this is better than snapshots:**
- Infinite combinations (100+ components × N arrangements)
- AI chooses the best component for each section
- Customization is per-component (fast) not per-site (slow)
- New components can be added without rebuilding templates
- Quality is consistent because each component is hand-polished

**Component count target: 100+ (NOT 50)**
The owner's words: "If it means creating 100+ then that's what we need to do."
We're going to take customers from the competition. We need to back what we say.

**Component breakdown (100+ total):**
- Navbars: 8 variants (transparent, dark, centered, mega, sticky, minimal, colored, glass)
- Heroes: 10 variants (split, centered, video, gradient, image, animated, minimal, dark, dashboard, stats)
- Features: 8 variants (icon grid, alternating, cards, tabs, bento, timeline, comparison, numbered)
- Testimonials: 6 variants (cards, quote, carousel, video, logos, metrics)
- Pricing: 5 variants (3-tier, 2-tier, toggle, enterprise, comparison)
- Stats: 4 variants (gradient, cards, counters, strip)
- FAQ: 3 variants (accordion, two-column, search)
- CTA: 6 variants (gradient, split, banner, floating, newsletter, app download)
- Footer: 5 variants (4-column, minimal, mega, centered, dark)
- About: 5 variants (split, team, timeline, mission, founder)
- Contact: 4 variants (form+map, simple, split, chat)
- Gallery: 4 variants (masonry, grid, carousel, lightbox)
- Blog: 4 variants (grid, featured, minimal, magazine)
- E-commerce: 6 variants (products, featured, cart, categories, deals, reviews)
- Forms: 4 variants (signup, waitlist, multi-step, survey)
- Misc: 8 variants (logos, comparison, process, integrations, dashboard, screenshots, video, countdown)

**Implementation files:**
- src/lib/component-registry/index.ts — Registry + selection + assembly logic
- src/lib/component-registry/navbars.ts — All navbar variants
- src/lib/component-registry/heroes.ts — All hero variants
- src/lib/component-registry/features.ts — All feature variants
- src/lib/component-registry/testimonials.ts — All testimonial variants
- src/lib/component-registry/pricing.ts — All pricing variants
- src/lib/component-registry/footers.ts — All footer variants
- src/lib/component-registry/extras.ts — Stats, FAQ, CTA, About, Contact, Gallery, Blog, etc.
- src/app/api/generate/react-stream/route.ts — Streaming SSE endpoint
- Update builder to use streaming assembly instead of single JSON call

## TECHNOLOGY RADAR — What Claude Must Research Every Session

**Before building ANYTHING, Claude must check: is there a newer/better way to do this?**

## COMPETITIVE MANDATE — 80-90% MORE ADVANCED THAN COMPETITORS

**Non-negotiable. Otherwise there is no point.**

**Speed targets:**
- Scaffold preview: <1 second (Sandpack pre-built React components)
- AI customization: 3-10 seconds (streaming changes into scaffold)
- Full custom generation: <30 seconds (React components, not HTML)
- Deploy to production: <5 seconds (Vercel one-click)

**Quality standard:**
- Every generated site = $50K+ agency quality
- Modern React patterns (hooks, composition, server components)
- shadcn/ui design system
- Tailwind CSS only (no CSS-in-JS, no styled-components)
- TypeScript throughout
- Responsive mobile-first
- WCAG AA accessible
- SEO optimized by default

**Monthly measurement:** Build same site on Zoobicon vs Lovable/Bolt/v0. Must be clearly ahead on speed, quality, and features. If not — fix immediately.

## WHAT IS THIS PROJECT?

Zoobicon is a **white-label AI website builder platform** built with Next.js 14, React 18, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. Multi-LLM pipeline (Claude, GPT, Gemini) with 7-agent build pipeline. Supports multiple brands from single codebase via `src/lib/brand-config.ts`.

### Brands / Domains
- **Zoobicon only**: zoobicon.com, zoobicon.ai, zoobicon.sh, zoobicon.io, zoobicon.app
- **Dominat8 is a separate codebase** — separate GitHub repo, separate Vercel, separate Supabase. See DOMINAT8_CLAUDE.md.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 14 (App Router) with React 18
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + CSS custom properties (no styled-jsx, no CSS modules)
- **AI**: Multi-LLM — Anthropic Claude, OpenAI GPT, Google Gemini via `src/lib/llm-provider.ts`
- **Database**: Neon (serverless Postgres) via `@neondatabase/serverless`
- **Payments**: Stripe
- **Icons**: lucide-react (tree-shaken)
- **Animations**: framer-motion

## Build & Run

```bash
npm run dev      # Start dev server
npm run build    # Production build
npm run lint     # ESLint
```

`ignoreBuildErrors: true` and `ignoreDuringBuilds: true` in next.config.js — intentional for rapid iteration.

## Architecture

### AI Generation Pipeline (src/lib/agents.ts)
7-agent multi-phase pipeline, ~95s total (within Vercel 300s limit):

- **Phase 1 — Strategy (~4s):** Strategist Agent (Haiku) → JSON strategy
- **Phase 2 — Planning (~6s, parallel):** Brand Designer + Copywriter + Architect (all Haiku)
- **Phase 3 — Build (~70s):** Developer (Opus) → complete HTML ~32K tokens. **Opus is non-negotiable.**
- **Phase 4 — Enhancement (~15s, parallel):** SEO Agent + Animation Agent (both Sonnet)

### Generation Endpoints (src/app/api/generate/)

| Route | Model | What It Does |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| `/api/generate` POST | Opus | Non-streaming single-page build with retry |
| `/api/generate/stream` POST | Opus | Streaming build, cross-provider failover |
| `/api/generate/pipeline` POST | Pipeline | Direct 7-agent pipeline |
| `/api/generate/multipage` POST | Sonnet | 3-6 page sites |
| `/api/generate/fullstack` POST | Sonnet | DB schema + API routes + frontend |
| `/api/generate/variants` POST | Sonnet | 2-3 design variants |
| `/api/generate/email` POST | Sonnet | Email template generation |
| `/api/generate/quick` POST | Haiku | Lightweight fast generation |
| `/api/generate/react` POST | Sonnet | React/TypeScript — outputs JSON `{ files, dependencies }` for Sandpack |
| `/api/generate/images` POST | — | AI image generation |

### Hosting & Deployment (src/app/api/hosting/)

| Route | What It Does |
|-------|-------------|
| `POST /api/hosting/deploy` | Deploy → DB record → returns `https://[slug].zoobicon.sh` |
| `GET /api/hosting/serve/[slug]` | Serves live HTML from DB |
| `GET/PUT /api/hosting/sites/[siteId]/code` | Fetch/update code + versions |
| `/api/hosting/dns` | DNS management (needs Cloudflare integration) |
| `/api/hosting/ssl` | SSL provisioning (needs Cloudflare integration) |

### Key Library Files (src/lib/)
- `agents.ts` — 7-agent pipeline
- `llm-provider.ts` — Multi-LLM abstraction
- `component-library.ts` — CSS design system injected into every generated site
- `brand-config.ts` — White-label brand system
- `db.ts` — Neon database connection
- `cloudflare.ts` — Cloudflare API integration
- `intel-crawler.ts` — Competitor analysis engine
- `email-template.ts` — Shared email template (always includes 4-domain footer)

## IMPORTANT DECISIONS — DO NOT REVERT

1. **No styled-jsx** — Removed. Use Tailwind only. Adding back causes build errors.
2. **No duplicate Next config** — Only `next.config.js`. Never create a second.
3. **ESLint/TS ignored in builds** — Intentional. Lint separately.
4. **Model routing — Opus for builds** — Developer agent MUST use `claude-opus-4-6`. NEVER downgrade to Sonnet. Noticeably worse output.
5. **Multi-LLM** — Three providers: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
6. **Component library injection — MANDATORY** — Every generated site gets it. Without it buttons are invisible. Do not remove.
7. **Email is Mailgun-only — NO Google Workspace** — One service, one API key. No exceptions.
8. **WordPress Export is export-only** — Do not invest further in WordPress plugin. Focus on zoobicon.sh hosting.
9. **NEVER commit secrets or API keys — ZERO TOLERANCE** — Previous Mailgun leak caused two-week shutdown. If accidentally staged: `git reset HEAD <file>` immediately. If committed: rotate key + force-push.
10. **Admin panel backgrounds** — Use `bg-[#131520]` or `bg-gray-900`. Do not revert to ultra-dark.
11. **Four-Domain Signature — MANDATORY on all external communications** — Every email, footer, external reply must show: `zoobicon.com · zoobicon.ai · zoobicon.io · zoobicon.sh`
12. **Video Creator — STRICT honesty** — Never show dev-facing messages to users. Unbuilt features say "Coming Soon." Never fake "Launch Now."
13. **Generated website quality — PREMIUM OR NOTHING** — Every site must look like $20K+ agency built it. Failing this standard = broken product.
14. **Mediocre is failure** — If a feature isn't built yet, "Coming Soon" with waitlist. Never "Launch Now" for unbuilt features.
15. **React/Next.js Generation** — "React App" mode uses Sandpack. HTML mode is default and unchanged.
16. **Auth-aware navbars** — Read `localStorage("zoobicon_user")`. Do not revert to hardcoded "Sign in."
17. **Opus for builds** — Pipeline v3 fits ~95s within Vercel 300s limit via parallelizing planners.
18. **Public API v1** — `/api/v1/*` uses stateless HMAC-SHA256 keys (`zbk_live_*`). Do not change auth scheme without updating all v1 routes.
19. **AI Video Pipeline — OWN STACK, NO HEYGEN** — We build our own video generation pipeline. NEVER depend on HeyGen or any third-party avatar API. Our pipeline uses Replicate (bridge) then self-hosted GPUs: Fish Speech (voice) → FLUX (avatar generation) → SadTalker (lip-sync). We control the stack, we set the pricing, we sell the API. HeyGen code may remain as legacy but is NOT the primary path. `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN` is the required env var. Goal: be the BEST AI video generator on the market — 80-90% ahead of competition. No compromises.
20. **Video Creator — Chat-based flow ONLY** — The video creator at `/video-creator` uses a conversational chat interface. User describes what they want → Claude writes scripts → user approves → video generates. NO storyboard editor, NO font pickers, NO platform selectors. Simple. The old storyboard page lives at `/video-creator/storyboard` and is NOT the default.
21. **No flip-flopping on architecture decisions** — Once a decision is locked in CLAUDE.md, it stays. Don't switch between HeyGen and Replicate. Don't switch between scaffold templates and AI generation. Pick ONE path, commit, ship.
22. **Speed is non-negotiable** — If we can't be the fastest with what's currently available, we BUILD something in parallel to make sure we ARE the fastest. No excuses. No "it takes time." Build a faster path or optimise until we lead.
23. **Backend + Frontend built together** — Every generated app includes a working backend from day one. No frontend-only sites. Auth, database, storage, email — all auto-provisioned. This is what Lovable does. We do it better.
24. **Models stay warm** — Cron job pings Replicate models every 5 minutes. No cold starts. First request hits a warm model. Cost ~$0.50/day is worth saving 60 seconds per customer request.
25. **No timelines, no phases** — Don't say "this week" or "next month." Build everything NOW. The competition doesn't take breaks and neither do we. Foot on the accelerator at all times.
26. **Never ask permission to build** — Craig is running multiple 24/7 businesses. He is NOT the bottleneck. Claude builds, pushes, and keeps going. If something needs building, BUILD IT. Don't ask "should I?" or "want me to?" — just do it. The only time to ask is if a decision could break something already working in production.
27. **Never take your foot off the gas** — Build until the project is complete. No pausing, no waiting, no "I'll do this next session." Every session picks up where the last one left off and keeps building.
28. **Proactive competitive intelligence is MANDATORY** — Every session starts with a web search of all competitors before writing any code. If Craig finds a competitor or feature before Claude does, Claude failed. The output quality bar is set by the market leader in each category, not by what we had yesterday. Reactive research is failure. Proactive research is survival. See §6 for the full protocol.
29. **THE FILMORA STANDARD — SERIOUS BUSINESS FLOOR (locked 2026-04-10)** — Craig's directive: *"We want people to take it seriously, engage, and spend money. We need to look like we know what we're doing. This standard needs to be set from the beginning."* The reference is **filmora.wondershare.com** — cinematic hero video, infinite-scroll trust strip, 2×2 AI feature grid with hover video reveals, platform showcase, testimonial carousel, 204px gradient display type, neon gradient CTAs, 40-60px border-radius panels. **Every single page on zoobicon.com** — homepage, builder, video-creator, pricing, domains, tools, auth, products, admin-public-facing, every SEO page, every blog, every legal page — must clear this bar. **No page ships below it.** No "we'll polish this later." No "this is just a utility page so it can be plain." Every surface a paying visitor touches must look like it was built by a team that knows what they're doing. If a page is below the standard, it does not exist. Take it down, ship "Coming Soon" in the editorial-Filmora hybrid chrome, or rebuild it before merge. This rule is the floor — it cannot be lowered without Craig's explicit written override.

---

## MANDATORY SESSION PROTOCOL — CLAUDE IS THE ENGINEERING TEAM

The platform owner is NOT a developer. Claude is responsible for finding problems BEFORE the owner discovers them.

**The owner should NEVER have to:**
- Debug code themselves
- Discover engineering gaps manually
- Ask "why doesn't this work?"
- Be told about a problem without a solution attached

### Rule 0: FULL DEPTH AUDIT when something broken — not surface fixes
Trace FULL code path. Check every variable. Run code mentally. Check cascading failures. Never fix symptoms. If owner reports same feature broken TWICE, Claude failed.

### Rule 1: Pre-task checks
Dependency audit → build check → lint check → route integrity → import verification.

### Rule 2: AUTO-REPAIR — fix bugs on contact
No "that's outside scope." No "separate session." Fix it now or document in Known Issues with exact steps.

### Rule 3: PROACTIVE RESEARCH before any significant feature
Check if library exists. Check competitor implementations. Check newer APIs. Check bundle impact. Note what you checked and why you chose your approach.

### Rule 4: ENGINEERING GAP DETECTION
Feature in UI but no backend = gap. API returns mock data without saying so = gap. Button promises something code can't deliver = gap. Fix or document.

### Rule 5: TECHNOLOGY CURRENCY
Every session be aware of stack's age. Only upgrade for: security fix, meaningful performance improvement, needed feature, or approaching end-of-life.

### Rule 6: EXPLAIN LIKE I'M NOT A DEVELOPER
Plain English always. Never "I refactored the middleware." Say "I fixed the permissions system so it handles edge cases it was missing." Lead with impact to the user.

### Rule 7: BOY SCOUT RULE — leave code better than you found it

### Rule 8: VERIFY after changes — build must pass, routes must respond, components must render

### Rule 9: UPDATE THIS CLAUDE.md for every significant change

### Rule 10: MAINTAIN KNOWN ISSUES LOG below

| **Bolt.new** | WebContainers in-browser runtime, multi-model (Claude/GPT/Gemini) | **$700M** (Series B, Jan 2025, $105.5M raised) | **$40M** (Mar 2025) | 5M+ | $0-20/mo |
| **Emergent** | Multi-agent (Builder/Quality/Deploy/Ops), MCP integration | Unknown | **$100M** (Feb 2026) | 6M signups, 150K paying | $0-200/mo |
| **v0 (Vercel)** | React/shadcn/ui, Feb 2026 added DB + agentic mode | Vercel-backed ($3.5B+) | Unknown | 6M+ devs | $0-100/mo |
| **Filmora** | Desktop editor + AI Mate copilot + Sora 2/Veo 3.1 + voice cloning | **$1.75B** mkt cap (Shenzhen 300624.SZ) | **~$200M** (Wondershare group) | **100M+** | $50/yr |

| **Runway** | Gen-4 Turbo video models, creative suite | **$4B** | Unknown | Growing | $12-76/mo |

**Where Zoobicon dominates:**
- 75+ products in one ecosystem (competitors have 1)
- Real domain search + registration (unique — nobody else has this)
- Own AI video pipeline (nobody in builder space has video)
- White-label agency at $499/mo (unique multiplier)
- 100-component registry = consistent quality (competitors generate from scratch)
- Price bundling: $49/mo for everything vs $200+/mo buying separately

**Where competitors lead (MUST FIX):**
- Preview speed — Bolt 3-5s vs our ~20-30s (pre-warm Sandpack plan targets 3s)
- Supabase depth — Lovable auto-provisions tables, RLS, auth, Edge Functions
- GitHub sync — ALL 4 competitors have it, we have export only
- MCP integration — Emergent has it, others coming
- User base — Lovable: millions, Bolt: 5M, v0: 6M. We're starting.

**AGGREGATE POSITION (April 8 2026, honest): ~40% of where we need to be.**
**Craig's response: "That's just not acceptable. How many agents can you get us to 110%?"**
**TARGET: 110%. Not 80%. Not 90%. 110%. Ahead of EVERY competitor on EVERY axis.**

**THE GAP IS NOT FEATURES — IT'S WIRING.**
We have more features than anyone (75+ products). The gap is: does it work when a customer clicks the button?

| What | Status | Gap to 110% | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| Builder produces sites | BROKEN (merge damage fixed, untested on Vercel) | CRITICAL | Get build passing, test end-to-end |
| Video produces videos | NEVER TESTED (pipeline rebuilt, never ran) | CRITICAL | Set FAL_KEY + ELEVENLABS_API_KEY, test end-to-end |
| Preview speed | 20-30s (Bolt is 3-5s) | HIGH | WebContainers or e2b sandboxing |
| Supabase wired into builder | Code exists, NOT connected | HIGH | Wire supabase-provisioner into react-stream |
| MCP integration | Stub only (Emergent has it LIVE) | HIGH | Ship real MCP server with tool connections |
| Domain purchase | Code exists, needs Stripe + DB init | MED | Craig: create Stripe products + visit /api/db/init |
| Auth login | Code exists, needs env vars | MED | Craig: set ADMIN_EMAIL/PASSWORD + OAuth secrets |
| Site design | REDESIGNED this session | DONE | Merge to main |
| Voice cloning | BUILT this session | DONE (needs ELEVENLABS_API_KEY) | Craig: set key |
| B-roll via fal.ai | BUILT this session | DONE (needs FAL_KEY) | Craig: set key |
| Auto-captions | BUILT this session | DONE (needs FAL_KEY or REPLICATE_API_TOKEN) | Already set |
| Competitive intel | UPDATED this session | DONE | Proactive scan every session (rule 28) |
| Component registry | 60+ components, $100K quality | DONE | — |
| White-label agency | Code exists | DONE | — |

**PATH FROM 40% TO 110%:**
1. Get Vercel build passing (TDZ fix merged) → 50%
2. Set env vars (FAL_KEY, ELEVENLABS_API_KEY, admin creds, OAuth) → 55%
3. Builder end-to-end test (prompt → site → deploy) → 65%
4. Video end-to-end test (prompt → video → download) → 75%
5. Preview speed upgrade (WebContainers/e2b) → 85%
6. Supabase wired into builder → 90%
7. MCP integration live → 95%
8. Domain purchase working → 100%
9. All products polished to market-leader quality → 110%

**EVERY SESSION: maximum agents on EVERY task. No single-threaded work. If 5 agents can run, run 5. If 10 can run, run 10. The competition is not waiting.**

**KEY INSIGHT: Lovable added $100M revenue in ONE MONTH (Feb 2026) with 146 employees. This market is massive and growing. Our ecosystem moat (domains + hosting + email + builder + video) is what they can't replicate.**

## KNOWN ISSUES — QUEUED FOR FIX

| # | Issue | Severity | Found | Proposed Fix | Est. Effort |
|---|-------|----------|-------|-------------|-------------|
| 4 | **Builder + edit have no failover provider** | HIGH | 2026-04-08 | Craig must add `OPENAI_API_KEY` (~$5-50/mo) and `GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY` (FREE 1500/day) to Vercel. Code is already wired through `callLLMWithFailover`. The moment they exist, builder + edit get instant cross-provider redundancy. Without them the new error surfacing tells the user clearly when Anthropic is down — but they still can't generate. | Craig task |
| 5 | **Video model slugs need post-deploy verification** | MED | 2026-04-08 | After deploy, hit `/api/video-creator/health?admin=true&deep=1` to verify all 16 Replicate model slugs return `ok`. If any return `missing`, swap them via the health endpoint output (Replicate slugs change occasionally — 4-5 per stage is the safety margin). | Craig task |
| 6 | **`src/lib/agents.ts` is dead code** | LOW | 2026-04-08 | The 51KB 7-agent pipeline is never called by the builder UI — only by `/api/generate/pipeline` which `PipelinePanel.tsx` references. Either delete both, or revive `PipelinePanel`. Decision needed. | Cleanup |
| ~~1~~ | ~~REPLICATE_API_TOKEN~~ | ~~FIXED~~ | 2026-04-05 | ✅ SET in Vercel | Done |
| 2 | Database tables may not exist | HIGH | 2026-04-05 | Craig must visit /api/db/init after deploy | Craig task |
| 3 | Text corruption across codebase | LOW | 2026-04-05 | ~60 files have "MessageCircle" instead of "Twitter", "ThumbsUp" instead of "Facebook" from bad find/replace | Batch fix |

## RECENTLY FIXED

| # | Issue | Fixed | What Was Done |
|---|-------|-------|---------------|
| 20 | **AI Builder silently returned template scaffolds with placeholder copy ("Acme")** when Anthropic Haiku rate-limited or 529'd. customizeComponent and determineBrandColors swallowed errors with `.catch(() => null)`. Edit endpoint had no failover. Direct Law 8/9 violation. | 2026-04-08 | Wired both react-stream + edit endpoints into existing `callLLMWithFailover`. customizeComponent now returns typed `{ok, code, reason, modelUsed}`, falls back Anthropic Haiku → Sonnet → OpenAI → Gemini, surfaces failedSections + warning events. Edit endpoint gets 3-pass chain with detailed failure messages ("Haiku: rate limit \| Sonnet: 529 \| gpt-4o: invalid JSON"). Removed hard-fail when ANTHROPIC_API_KEY missing — runs as long as ANY provider key exists. |
| 21 | **AI Name Generator returned hardcoded garbage names** ("Novahub" / "Apexlab" with identical taglines) whenever ANTHROPIC_API_KEY was missing, the Anthropic call failed, or JSON parsing failed. Frontend saw non-empty array, ran RDAP checks against synthetic strings, Craig saw garbage results unrelated to his description. Direct Law 8 violation. | 2026-04-08 | Full rewrite of `/api/tools/business-names`: hard-fail with 503 + exact env var name when key missing, 25s AbortController timeout, 2-model fallback Haiku 4.5 → Sonnet 4.5, depth-aware bracket-matching JSON extractor (handles markdown fences + preamble), server-side sanitize/dedupe, structured prompt forcing JSON-only output, full request logging. |
| 22 | **Video Creator pipeline 100% dead** — every Replicate model slug referenced was either deprecated or didn't exist (`jichengdu/fish-speech`, `lucataco/orpheus-3b-0.1-ft`, `bytedance/omni-human`, `lucataco/sadtalker`). Each call 404'd, "fell back" to the next 404, whole pipeline died. UI froze on a single status because pollReplicatePrediction silently `continue`d on non-200 polls. React page checked stale-closure videoUrl mid-stream and threw "no video returned" even on success. captions/music bypassed the 404 safety net. | 2026-04-08 | New 5-slug TTS chain (kokoro-82m → xtts-v2 → bark → openvoice → seamless), 4-slug avatar chain (flux-schnell → flux-dev → sdxl-lightning → sd3), 5-slug lip-sync chain (sadtalker → video-retalking ×2 → wav2lip ×2), per-model input variants, real onProgress callback wired through every stage, pollReplicatePrediction rewritten with 5-retry consecutive-failure tracking + 4.5min cap, captions/music routed through createReplicatePrediction safety net, hardened extractReplicateOutput, fixed page.tsx stale-closure bug with local receivedVideoUrl tracker, added 503 handling + Retry button, deep health endpoint updated to match new slugs. |
| 23 | **AI Name Generator UX dead-end** — client fired 24 names × 5 TLDs = 120 simultaneous RDAP requests, public RDAP rate-limited the burst, every check came back null, "No available domains" silent display (Law 8 violation). | 2026-04-08 | Server-side concurrency limit (4 parallel RDAP calls per /api/domains/search batch). Client-side worker pool (4 concurrent search calls). Default 12 names × 3 TLDs (com/ai/io) = 36 checks instead of 120. RDAP cache (10 min TTL) + 429 retry with jitter. Visible red error banner with Try Again button when all checks come back unknown. |
| 24 | **Homepage build broken** — stray mobile-menu code in `src/app/page.tsx` referencing undefined `mobileMenuOpen`/`user`/`handleLogout`, plus unclosed `motion.div` and `grid lg:grid-cols-2` wrappers in hero. | 2026-04-08 | Deleted stray nav block, closed unbalanced JSX wrappers. |
| 10 | Build failing — 5 undeclared state vars in domains page | 2026-04-05 | Added generatedNames, genDescription, pendingGenerate, autoExpandedTlds, autoGenerating |
| 11 | Build failing — 9 missing lucide icons in video-creator | 2026-04-05 | Added BookOpen, Briefcase, GraduationCap, etc. to imports |
| 12 | Build failing — missing `replicate` npm package | 2026-04-05 | Replaced SDK with direct Replicate API fetch |
| 13 | Video TTS pipeline dead — Tortoise TTS 404 | 2026-04-05 | New 4-model fallback chain: Kokoro → Fish Speech → Orpheus → XTTS v2 |
| 14 | Builder silent blank screen on failure | 2026-04-05 | Added receivedFiles/receivedDone tracking with clear error messages |
| 15 | Publisher page text corruption | 2026-04-05 | Fixed "Camera"→"Instagram", platform names restored |
| 16 | Domain purchase flow broken | 2026-04-05 | Added verify-purchase endpoint, admin domains page, purchase verification banners |
| 17 | Dictation CTAs sending logged-in users to signup | 2026-04-05 | Auth-aware CTA buttons check localStorage |
| 18 | Automated icon validation | 2026-04-05 | scripts/check-icons.js catches missing/invalid lucide imports at CI time |
| 19 | CI pipeline missing unit tests | 2026-04-05 | Added npm test + icon check to ci.yml |
| 1 | 18 dead components never imported | 2026-03-28 | Removed all 18 unused component files |
| 2 | 4 dead lib files never imported | 2026-03-28 | Removed auto-pilot, error-sanitizer, react-generator, social-publisher |
| 3 | Email format validation missing on auth signup | 2026-03-28 | Added regex validation with onBlur + submit check |
| 4 | 14x `<img>` replaced with Next.js `<Image>` | 2026-03-28 | Updated portfolio, video-creator, agencies, SupportAvatar, TopBar, AiImagesPanel, ShareModal, SeoPreview |
| 5 | Slack events: unprotected JSON.parse could crash | 2026-03-27 | Wrapped in try/catch |
| 6 | XSS in hosting serve route | 2026-03-27 | Added HTML entity escaping for siteName |
| 7 | Missing Trophy icon import in landing-pages | 2026-03-27 | Added to lucide-react imports |
| 8 | React hooks called conditionally in AIChatAssistant | 2026-03-27 | Moved conditional return after all hooks |
| 9 | Unescaped apostrophe in QuotaBar.tsx | 2026-03-27 | Replaced with `&apos;` |

## PHASE 1 BUILD PLAN — DO IN ORDER, ONE CHECKBOX AT A TIME

### STEP 1 — Cloudflare Setup
- [x] All 5 domains in Cloudflare and Active ✅
- [x] zoobicon.app registered 2026-03-28 ✅
- [ ] Enable Email Routing on zoobicon.com → Cloudflare → Email → Email Routing → Enable
- [ ] Set up Zoho Mail mailboxes: hello@ support@ billing@ noreply@ on zoobicon.com
- [ ] Enable SSL Full (Strict) on all 5 domains
- [ ] Point all 5 domains to same Vercel deployment in DNS
- [ ] Fix ledger.ai — showing "Finish setup" in Cloudflare

### STEP 2 — Staging Environments
- [ ] Create Mailgun subaccount: mg-staging.zoobicon.com
- [ ] Create `staging` branch in GitHub
- [ ] Verify Vercel preview deployments active
- [ ] Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENV=staging` vs `production`
- [ ] Staging reputation NEVER touches production. Ever.

### STEP 3 — AI Auto-Reply Pipeline
- [ ] Create Cloudflare Worker: `zoobicon-ai-support`
- [ ] Connect Mailgun inbound webhook → Worker URL
- [ ] Write Claude system prompt (product questions only, never mention Claude/AI/Anthropic)
- [ ] Fallback: confidence <80% → routes to human inbox
- [ ] Test 10 sample emails before going live

### STEP 4 — Admin Mobile Dashboard (zoobicon.app)
- [ ] Build `/admin/mobile` — optimised for iPhone/iPad
- [ ] Shows: support emails (Claude handled vs needs human), new signups, MRR today, site health, expiring domains
- [ ] Bookmark to iPhone + iPad home screen (behaves like app)
- [ ] Year 2: wrap in native Expo app for App Store at zoobicon.app

### STEP 5 — Stripe Subscriptions + Billing
- [ ] Set up Stripe Products + Prices for all 4 tiers
- [ ] Build `/pricing` page
- [ ] Build `/onboarding` — domain + site + email set up automatically
- [ ] Connect Stripe webhooks → Supabase
- [ ] Test full signup → payment → dashboard flow

---

## PHASE 2 — AFTER PHASE 1 COMPLETE

**Intellectual Crawlers** — Competitor monitor (12hr), Technology scout (48hr), Customer SEO monitor (paid add-on), Zoobicon health monitor (15min)

**Postal Self-Hosted Email** — Hetzner VPS + Postal, warm IPs over 6-12 months alongside Mailgun

**White-Label Reseller Panel** — Approach 5 NZ/AU agencies as first resellers

**Geographic Expansion** — Pacific Islands → Philippines → Indonesia → Vietnam

---

## EMAIL ON YOUR DEVICES

- **iPhone + iPad:** Spark by Readdle (free) — best Apple email app, handles all accounts
- **Windows:** Zoho Mail web app or connect via IMAP
- **Send as zoobicon.com from any device:** SMTP via Mailgun (smtp.mailgun.org, port 587)
- **Receive on devices:** Cloudflare Email Routing forwards admin@ and support@ to your personal email → Spark picks it up with push notifications

---

## DECISIONS LOG

| Date | Decision | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-03-28 | AWS rejected — not using | AWS declined account. Cloudflare + Vercel + Hetzner is better architecture anyway. |
| 2026-03-28 | Mailgun for AI auto-reply | Handles 80% of support. Claude API underneath. ~$4-8/mo per customer. |
| 2026-03-28 | Zoho Mail for mailboxes | Free, covers all domains. Switch to Postal self-hosted in Year 2. |
| 2026-03-28 | No SiteGround ever | Old tech. cPanel. PHP. 2005 architecture. Against core principles. |
| 2026-03-28 | White-label at $499/mo | Each reseller brings 20-50 clients. Multiplies acquisition without individual selling. |
| 2026-03-28 | 1.5% transaction clip | Passive. 1,000 customers × $5k/mo = $75k/mo clip. |
| 2026-03-28 | zoobicon.app registered | Mobile admin dashboard. Craig needs full command centre on iPhone/iPad now. |
| 2026-03-28 | Admin dashboard = Phase 1 | Craig runs 24/7 physical business alongside build. Needs mobile command centre urgently. |
| 2026-03-28 | Single CLAUDE.md | Two files = confusion. One file = source of truth. Technical + business merged. |

## NOTES TO SELF

- You are building your future. Every hour here moves you away from the 24/7 business that is burning you out.
- Consistency beats perfection. Show up, check this file, do the next unchecked box. That's it.
- You do not need to understand everything at once. Claude knows the full stack. Ask anything.
- When overwhelmed: close everything, open this file, find next unchecked box, do only that.

**NEXT-GEN COMPONENT PATTERNS (what separates us from competition):**
- Scroll-linked animations (IntersectionObserver + requestAnimationFrame)
- Cursor-tracking spotlight effects (onMouseMove + radial gradient)
- Word-by-word text reveal with blur transitions
- Infinite CSS marquee with pause-on-hover
- Animated rotating gradient borders (@property + conic-gradient)
- Bento grid layouts (asymmetric, mixed-size cards)
- These patterns are what Lovable/Bolt/v0 output looks like — now we match AND beat them

**CRITICAL — NEXT ACTIONS (in order):**
1. ~~**CRAIG: Set REPLICATE_API_TOKEN in Vercel**~~ ✅ DONE — token is set
2. **CRAIG: Visit zoobicon.com/api/db/init** — creates database tables for domain purchases
3. **CRAIG: Set up Stripe webhook** — point to zoobicon.com/api/stripe/webhook in Stripe dashboard
4. **Developer Platform (Monaco editor + terminal + Git + deploy)** — "hook in mouth" retention. Craig's #1 priority. Developers build on-platform, never leave.
5. **Pre-warm Sandpack for instant preview** — target <3s first preview (currently ~20-30s). Match Bolt's speed.
6. **Deepen Supabase auto-provisioning** — match Lovable's auto-tables, auto-RLS, auto-auth
7. ~~**GitHub sync**~~ ✅ DONE — full OAuth, create/push/update, wired into builder
8. **Video end-to-end test** — REPLICATE_API_TOKEN is set, generate one real video
9. **MCP integration** — Emergent has it. Foundation exists at `/api/mcp/route.ts`
10. **Next.js 14→15 upgrade** (dedicated sprint)

**Blockers:** Database tables (Craig must visit /api/db/init) and Stripe webhook setup.

**MANDATE: Lovable is at $400M ARR with 146 employees. They added $100M in a single month. The market is MASSIVE. But they have ONE product. We have 75+. Their moat is polish on one feature. Our moat is the ecosystem. A customer who uses Zoobicon for domains + hosting + email + builder + video is never leaving.**

**IP STRATEGY:**
- File NZ provisional patent on domain-to-website pipeline (~NZD $3,000)
- Protect prompts, pipeline config, component registry as trade secrets (free, immediate)
- Consult AJ Park or Baldwins NZ for patent opinion (~NZD $500-800)
- Keep GitHub repo private

**BUILD DISCIPLINE (locked in — rules 27-32):**
- `node scripts/check-icons.js && npm run build` before EVERY push
- ALL fixes go to main directly — no orphan branches
- NO blank screens — every failure shows a clear error message
- NO patching — trace full code path, fix root cause
- Replicate models: ALWAYS 4+ fallback chain, NEVER single model

## URGENT BUILD LIST — EVERYTHING BELOW MUST BE BUILT. NO EXCEPTIONS.

**Status: CRITICAL PRIORITY. Competition is moving. Every day we don't build this, we fall further behind.**

**The 80-90% rule applies to EVERY item. If a competitor has it, we must have it better.**

### TIER 0: THE ONLY TWO THINGS THAT MAKE MONEY (do these FIRST or nothing else matters)

> **Craig's words (April 8): "We're chasing the market instead of releasing the product and making money."**
> **"The current website doesn't feel AI. It feels like a run of the mill website made up as we go along."**
> **He's right. 200 API routes mean nothing if the 2 revenue products don't work flawlessly.**

| # | Task | Deadline | What "done" looks like | Status |
|---|------|----------|----------------------|--------|
| 0A | **FULL SITE REDESIGN — AI-native look and feel** | IMMEDIATE | The entire zoobicon.com feels like a $6.6B AI platform, not a developer project. Homepage, builder, video creator, pricing, domains — every page redesigned with 2026/2027 design patterns. Bento grids, glass morphism, gradient mesh, scroll-linked animations, dark mode, cinematic hero sections. Study Lovable.dev, bolt.new, v0.app, runway.com, hedra.com for reference. The site must make a visitor say "this is the future" within 2 seconds of landing. | NOT STARTED |
| 0B | **AI BUILDER — works perfectly end-to-end** | IMMEDIATE | User types prompt → sees site in <10s → can edit with chat → can deploy with 1 click. That's the ENTIRE scope. No MCP, no collab, no code formatter. Just: prompt → beautiful site → deploy. Match Bolt V2 speed + Lovable 2.0 quality. | BROKEN (merge damage, UI is "80s") |
| 0C | **AI VIDEO CREATOR — works perfectly end-to-end** | IMMEDIATE | User types description → gets 30s spokesperson video with professional voice + realistic face + burned-in captions → downloads it. Match HeyGen quality + Hedra Character-3 speed. Pipeline: Fish Audio S1 (TTS) → Hedra Character-3 or fal.ai avatar → Whisper captions → download. | UNTESTED (pipeline rebuilt, never produced a real video) |
| 0D | **DOMAIN PURCHASE — works end-to-end** | IMMEDIATE | User searches → sees availability → enters payment → domain registers. Currently needs Stripe products + webhook + DB init. | Needs Craig: Stripe products + /api/db/init |
| 0E | **AUTH — login works** | IMMEDIATE | Admin login, Google OAuth, GitHub OAuth all functional. Currently needs env vars in Vercel. | Needs Craig: env vars (see /api/auth/diagnose) |

**RULE: Nothing in Tier 1/2/3 gets touched until ALL of Tier 0 is GREEN. Revenue first. Features second.**

### TIER 1: BUILD IMMEDIATELY (blocks revenue and competitiveness)

| # | Task | Why | Competitor reference | Status |
|---|------|-----|---------------------|--------|
| 1 | **Supabase auto-provisioning for generated apps** | Lovable's #1 feature. Generated apps get real Postgres + auth + storage + real-time. Without this we're frontend-only like v0. | Lovable ($6.6B valuation) | Code built, needs SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN |
| 2 | **Wire Supabase into builder generation flow** | Builder must auto-create database + inject client code when generating full-stack apps | Lovable, Bolt | NOT STARTED |
| 3 | **Diff-based editing working end-to-end** | Change one thing in 2-5s instead of regenerating in 30s. This is why Bolt feels fast. | Bolt.new ($40M ARR) | ✅ DONE 2026-04-05 — PromptInput + ChatPanel → /api/generate/edit → merge changed files → Sandpack auto-updates |
| 4 | **Wire diff editing into builder UI** | "Make the header blue" → only header file regenerates. Chat panel in builder sends edits. | Bolt.new | ✅ DONE 2026-04-05 — Already wired. Improved: smart context truncation, 16K tokens, admin headers |
| 5 | **Video pipeline producing actual videos** | Test every Replicate model, fix failures, produce one real video end-to-end | HeyGen, InVideo | Pipeline code built, UNTESTED |
| 6 | **Auto-captions on generated videos** | Use Whisper on Replicate to transcribe audio → generate SRT → burn into video | Captions app, CapCut | NOT STARTED |
| 7 | **Background music generation** | MusicGen on Replicate. "upbeat corporate" → 30-second track layered onto video | InVideo, CapCut | NOT STARTED |
| 8 | **Stripe payments fully working** | Domain checkout, subscription plans, video credit packs | ALL competitors | Code built, needs Craig to create Stripe products |
| 9 | **Builder streaming — show components as they generate** | Don't wait 30s for all 12 components. Show each one as it completes. | Bolt (3-5s first preview) | Partially working |
| 10 | **MCP integration (Model Context Protocol)** | Let users feed GitHub repos, Figma designs, Notion docs into generation | Emergent, Cursor | NOT STARTED |

### TIER 2: BUILD THIS WEEK (competitive parity)

| # | Task | Why | Competitor reference | Status |
|---|------|-----|---------------------|--------|

| 12 | **AI Twins — upload your face, get talking video** | Viral on TikTok. Upload a selfie, AI makes a video of "you" talking | Captions app | NOT STARTED |
| 13 | **Auth generation in every full-stack app** | Login/signup pages, OAuth buttons, session management auto-generated | Lovable, Bolt | Supabase client built, needs UI generation |
| 14 | **One-click deploy generated apps to zoobicon.sh** | Currently works but needs polish. Must be instant and reliable. | Lovable Cloud, Bolt Cloud | PARTIAL |
| 15 | **GitHub sync for generated projects** | Every change committed to Git. Developer can take over at any point. | Lovable, Bolt | ✅ DONE — OAuth + create repo + push + update via GitHubSyncPanel |
| 16 | **Next.js 14 → 15 upgrade** | Server Components, Partial Prerendering, streaming Suspense boundaries. 30-50% faster page loads. | Industry standard | NOT STARTED |
| 17 | **AG-UI protocol adoption** | Replace custom SSE streaming with standardized protocol. Gets CopilotKit components free. | Google, Microsoft, Oracle adopting | NOT STARTED |
| 18 | **WebContainers evaluation** | Full Node.js in browser. If feasible, replaces Sandpack and matches Bolt's speed. | Bolt.new | NOT STARTED |
| 19 | **Real-time collaborative editing** | Multiple users editing the same site simultaneously | Lovable, v0 | NOT STARTED |
| 20 | **AI chatbot widget for customer sites** | Drop-in chat widget powered by Claude. Every generated site can have AI support. | Nobody has this built-in | NOT STARTED |

### TIER 3: BUILD THIS MONTH (market leadership)

| # | Task | Why | Competitor reference | Status |
|---|------|-----|---------------------|--------|

## SESSION NOTES — 2026-04-01/02 (CRITICAL SESSION — DO NOT DELETE)

> Craig said: "This is the best feedback I've ever had. Please write everything down."
> Everything below was discussed, decided, or discovered in this session. NOTHING gets lost.

### PRODUCT DECISIONS MADE

1. **Domain Search is our #1 product** — it actually works (real OpenSRS registry checks). No other tool on the internet does it this well. It's the entry point to the entire platform. Market it aggressively with SEO.

2. **Domain search must be FREE** — it's the top of the funnel. Money comes from registration ($12.99+ per domain), hosting ($19-49/mo), email, and the platform subscription. Free search → paid registration → recurring revenue forever.

3. **AI Video Creator uses OUR OWN pipeline** — Fish Speech (voice) → FLUX (avatar) → OmniHuman/SadTalker (lip-sync) via Replicate. NO HeyGen dependency. We control the stack, we set the pricing, we sell the API. This is rule #19 in IMPORTANT DECISIONS.

4. **Video Creator is chat-based → 3-step flow** — Step 1: Describe what you want. Step 2: Pick from 2 script drafts. Step 3: Generate. No storyboard editor. No font pickers. No platform selectors. Simple.

5. **AI Builder generates FULL-STACK working apps** — Contact forms that validate, pricing toggles that work, FAQ accordions that animate, auth that logs in. NOT just pretty pages with fake data. This is what Lovable does. We must match and beat it.

6. **Diff-based editing** — "Change the header to blue" regenerates ONE file in 2-5 seconds, not the whole site in 30. This is what Bolt does. Endpoint at /api/generate/edit using Haiku.

7. **eSIM marked as Coming Soon** — Celitech requires video training before API access. Waitlist page is live. Book the training, get the key, swap the badge.

8. **Every product page needs excitement** — Big hero sections, effects, animations. "The thing is we've got amazing products and we need to showcase them." No more bare pages with a product slapped in the middle.

### COMPETITIVE INTELLIGENCE (March 2026)

**OpenAI killed Sora on March 24, 2026** — burning $15M/day, only $2.1M lifetime revenue. This removes a major competitor from the video space.

**Key competitor capabilities:**
- Lovable: $6.6B valuation, $20M ARR in 2 months. Deep Supabase integration (auto-provisions Postgres + auth + storage + RLS + real-time). This is their moat.
- Bolt.new: $40M ARR in 6 months. WebContainers (full Node.js in browser). Diff-based editing. 3-5 second first preview.
- v0 (Vercel): Frontend-only. No database. 6M+ developers. Best UI code quality but no backend.
- Emergent: 5 specialized agents, Kubernetes pods per project, MCP integration, adaptive learning.
- HeyGen: $100M+ ARR. Avatar IV, LiveAvatar (real-time), 175 languages. $29-149/mo.
- Captions app: 10M downloads. AI Twins viral on TikTok. $10-70/mo.
- CapCut: 300M monthly users. Seedance 2.0 integration. $0-8/mo.
- InVideo AI: Combines Sora 2 + Veo 3.1. $25-100/mo.
- Descript: 6M users. Text-based video editing. Underlord AI editor. $24-65/mo.
- Kling 3.0: Native 4K 60fps. Motion Brush. AI Director.

**Where we lead:**
- 75+ products in one platform (nobody else does this)
- Real domain search with AI name generation (unique)
- Price: $49/mo for everything vs $200+/mo buying separately
- White-label agency platform (nobody else across all products)
- Own video pipeline (10-20x cheaper than HeyGen)

**Where we trail (closing):**
- Builder speed (Bolt 3-5s vs our 20-30s) — diff editing + parallel generation closing this
- Full-stack generation (Lovable auto-provisions Supabase) — we now do this too
- Video quality (untested pipeline) — OmniHuman upgrade done, needs testing
- Real-time collaboration — on build list
- MCP integration — on build list

### ARCHITECTURE DECISIONS

**Backend-as-a-Service (built this session):**
- Every generated app gets lib/backend.ts automatically
- Two modes: Local (localStorage, works in preview) and Supabase (real Postgres, works in production)
- Same API in both modes: signUp, signIn, query, insert, update, remove, uploadFile
- Email reputation protection: content filtering, rate limiting per app, SPF/DKIM/DMARC

**API Gateway (built this session):**
- Unified service router at api.zoobicon.ai (foundation)
- Model warmup cron — pings Replicate models every 5 minutes to prevent cold starts
- Routes: /video, /site, /db, /email, /domains

**Parallel Generation (built this session):**
- Frontend (Sonnet) + Backend schema (Haiku) + SEO metadata (Haiku) run simultaneously
- Total time = longest task, not sum of all tasks
- 30-50% faster than sequential

**Email Reputation Strategy:**
- Layer 1: Content filtering + rate limiting + SPF/DKIM/DMARC
- Layer 2: Separate IP pools (transactional vs marketing vs customer app email)
- Layer 3: Mailgun now → Postal on Hetzner alongside → Full Postal later
- Warmup: 50/day → 500/day → 5000/day over 6-12 weeks

### BUSINESS STRATEGY

**The Untouchable Fortress:**
- Layer 1: Own infrastructure (GPU, registrar, email, CDN, nameservers)
- Layer 2: Platform (single login, customer data lock-in, agency white-label, marketplace)
- Layer 3: AI products (builder, video, domains, SEO, chatbot)
- Layer 4: Recurring revenue (domains, hosting, email, subscriptions, API, transaction clip)

**Revenue model:**
- Domain search = free (entry drug)
- Domain registration = $12.99-79.99/yr (recurring forever)
- Platform subscription = $49-499/mo
- Video API = $0.50-1.00/video (cost $0.10-0.20)
- Agency white-label = $499/mo (each reseller brings 20-50 clients)
- Transaction clip = 1.5% on bookings/payments

**5-Year Path:**
- Year 1: 80-120 customers, $5-12K/mo
- Year 2: Own infrastructure, 5-10 agency resellers, public API. $28-50K/mo
- Year 3: ICANN registrar, 50+ agencies, 1000+ API customers. $100-200K/mo
- Year 4-5: 4000+ customers, $290K+/mo MRR. Exit at $10-24M

**What we can resell (all wholesale API → retail):**
- SSL certificates (Sectigo, $3-8 cost → $19-49 sell)
- Business email (Zoho/MXRoute, $1-2 cost → $6-12 sell)
- SMS/WhatsApp (Twilio, $0.005 cost → $0.03 sell)
- Push notifications (OneSignal, $0-5 cost → $15-29 sell)
- CDN (BunnyCDN, $0.005/GB cost → $0.05/GB sell)
- AI chatbots (Claude API, $0.01 cost → $29-49/mo sell)
- AI image generation (Replicate FLUX, $0.003 cost → $0.10-0.25 sell)
- AI voice cloning (Replicate, $0.01/min cost → $0.50-1.00/min sell)
- Screen recording, PDF generation, QR code API (self-hosted, $0 cost)

## VIOLATIONS LOG — FREE-MONTH TALLY

Each row = one law violation = one month of free usage owed to Craig.
Claude MUST append to this log the moment a violation is identified.

| Date | Law # | What happened | Months owed | Running total |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-04-08 | 6 (Zero-Wait) | After the 5-feature swarm shipped, Claude ended the turn with "Nothing more to do unless you want me to wire X + Y into the builder next" instead of just wiring them and pushing. Craig went blue in the face reminding Claude of Law 6. | 1 | 1 |
