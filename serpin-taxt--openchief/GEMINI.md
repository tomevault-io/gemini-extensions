# OpenChief

AI agents that passively watch business tools and produce reports via Claude. Open-source, serverless, runs on Cloudflare Workers.

## Architecture

- **pnpm monorepo + Turborepo** — `packages/shared`, `workers/*`, `workers/connectors/*`
- **Cloudflare Workers** — runtime (Durable Objects), router (Queue consumer), dashboard (React SPA + API), connectors (one Worker per data source)
- **Cloudflare D1** — shared database for agents, events, reports, revisions, identity mappings, model settings
- **Cloudflare KV** — caching layer for subscriptions, reports, user profiles, connector metadata, avatars
- **Cloudflare Queues** — `openchief-events` queue connects connectors to the router
- **Cloudflare Vectorize** — vector index for RAG (long-term memory), stores report/event embeddings
- **Cloudflare Workers AI** — embedding model (`@cf/baai/bge-base-en-v1.5`) for Vectorize indexing and retrieval
- **Durable Objects** — per-agent persistent state with SQLite inbox (events, reports, chat history, reasoning log)
- **React + Tailwind CSS v4** — SPA dashboard at `workers/dashboard`
- **Anthropic Claude** — LLM for report generation and agent chat (claude-sonnet-4-6 default)

## Key Commands

```bash
pnpm build              # Build all packages (Turborepo)
pnpm typecheck           # Type check everything
pnpm dev                 # Start local dev servers
pnpm seed                # Seed agent definitions from agents/ to D1 (auto-detects --local vs --remote)
pnpm seed --remote       # Force seed to remote D1 (deployed instance)
pnpm seed --local        # Force seed to local D1 (wrangler dev)
pnpm run setup           # Interactive setup wizard (creates Cloudflare resources)
pnpm generate-config     # Generate wrangler.jsonc files from openchief.config.ts
pnpm run deploy          # Build + deploy all workers
pnpm run teardown        # Delete all workers + Cloudflare resources (--yes to skip prompts)

# Deploy individual workers
cd workers/runtime && npx wrangler deploy
cd workers/router && npx wrangler deploy
cd workers/dashboard && npx wrangler deploy
cd workers/connectors/github && npx wrangler deploy
cd workers/connectors/slack && npx wrangler deploy
```

## Event Flow

```
Source (GitHub, Slack, etc.)
  → Connector Worker (normalize to OpenChiefEvent, publish to queue)
    → Cloudflare Queue (openchief-events)
      → Event Router Worker (identity resolution, tweet enrichment, persist to D1)
        → Agent Durable Object reads events from D1 at report time
          → Claude generates report
            → Report stored in D1 + KV + local SQLite
```

## RAG (Long-Term Memory)

RAG gives agents historical context beyond the 48–72 hour event window. Implemented in `workers/runtime/src/rag.ts`.

### How It Works

1. After each report is generated, `indexReport()` embeds the headline and each section as separate vectors and upserts them to Cloudflare Vectorize (non-blocking via `ctx.waitUntil()`)
2. Before generating a report or answering a chat message, `retrieveContext()` embeds the query and searches Vectorize for the top-10 most relevant historical items, filtered by `agentId`
3. The retrieved context is injected into the prompt as `═══ HISTORICAL CONTEXT ═══`

### Cloudflare Services

- **Vectorize** — vector database (`openchief-agents` index, 768 dimensions, cosine metric)
- **Workers AI** — embedding model `@cf/baai/bge-base-en-v1.5` (768-dim output)
- Bindings: `VECTORIZE: VectorizeIndex` and `AI: Ai` on the runtime worker (both optional)

### What Gets Indexed

| Vector Type | ID Pattern | Content | Metadata |
|-------------|------------|---------|----------|
| Report headline | `report:{id}:headline` | Headline + action items | agentId, reportType, health, createdAt |
| Report section | `report:{id}:s{index}` | Headline + section name + body | agentId, reportType, sectionName, severity |
| Event batch | `events:{agentId}:{startDate}` | ~20 event summaries joined | agentId, startDate, endDate, eventCount |

### Integration Points in `agent-do.ts`

- **Report generation** (~line 708): retrieves RAG context before `buildPrompt()`
- **Chat** (~line 202): retrieves RAG context using the user's message as query
- **Post-report indexing** (~line 815): indexes the report via `ctx.waitUntil()`

### Configuration

RAG is optional. It activates when `vectorizeIndexName` is set in `openchief.config.ts`:

```typescript
cloudflare: {
  // ...
  vectorizeIndexName: "openchief-agents",  // Set to enable RAG
}
```

The setup wizard creates the Vectorize index automatically. The `generate-config.ts` script adds `vectorize` and `ai` bindings to the runtime worker's `wrangler.jsonc` when configured.

### Admin Endpoint

`POST /admin/backfill-vectorize` — indexes all existing reports from D1 into Vectorize. Run this after first enabling RAG on an instance with existing data.

### Error Handling

All RAG operations fail gracefully — if Vectorize or Workers AI is unavailable, agents continue generating reports and answering chat without historical context. Errors are logged but never block report generation.

## Adding a New Agent

Agents are **data, not code** — JSON configs in `agents/`. To add a new one:

1. Create `agents/<id>.json` following the schema (see `agents/CLAUDE.md`)
2. Required fields: `id`, `name`, `description`, `subscriptions`, `persona`, `outputs`, `enabled`
3. Optional: `tools` (array of tool names the agent can use in chat), `visibility` (`"exec"` for private channel access)
4. Seed to D1: `pnpm seed` (auto-detects `--local` vs `--remote` from `openchief.config.ts`)
5. The seed script reads ALL `.json` files from `agents/` — no other code changes needed
6. Add an icon mapping in `workers/dashboard/src/components/AppSidebar.tsx` `agentIconMap`

## Adding a New Connector

1. Create `workers/connectors/<name>/` with `src/index.ts`, `package.json`, `wrangler.jsonc`
2. Implement: webhook handling and/or polling → normalize to `OpenChiefEvent` → publish to `EVENTS_QUEUE` queue
3. Add connector config to `CONNECTOR_CONFIGS` in `workers/dashboard/worker/index.ts`
4. Add source-to-tool mapping in `SOURCE_TO_TOOL` in same file
5. Add icon mapping in `workers/dashboard/src/components/SourceIcon.tsx`
6. Add to `pnpm-workspace.yaml` if not already covered by `workers/connectors/*` glob

## Agent Tools (Data-Driven)

Each agent definition has an optional `tools: string[]` array. Tools are looked up from the `ALL_TOOLS` registry in `workers/runtime/src/agent-tools.ts`:

| Tool | Description | Used By |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `query_events` | Read-only SQL (SELECT/WITH) against D1 events table | Most agents |
| `query_tasks` | Read-only SQL against D1 tasks table | CEO |
| `github_file` | Fetch file content or directory listing from configured repo | eng-manager, ciso |
| `github_search` | Code search in configured GitHub repo | eng-manager, ciso |

Tool access is enforced: agents without a tool in their `tools` array cannot use it in chat.

## Task System

Agents can propose, prioritize, and execute work items autonomously. The task lifecycle is: `proposed → queued → in_progress → completed` (or `cancelled`).

### How It Works

1. **Proposal** — During report generation, agents can propose tasks in the `taskProposals[]` array of their JSON output. Proposals are parsed by `parseTaskProposals()` and inserted into D1 with status `proposed`.
2. **Prioritization** — The CEO's daily meeting prompt includes all proposed tasks under "TASK QUEUE — AWAITING YOUR PRIORITIZATION". The CEO approves (→ `queued`) or cancels via `taskDecisions[]`, parsed by `parseTaskDecisions()`.
3. **Execution** — The dual alarm system checks hourly during business hours (8am–6pm weekdays). Each agent picks its highest-priority queued task, marks it `in_progress`, builds a task execution prompt with persona + RAG context, calls Claude, and stores the structured output.
4. **Dashboard** — Tasks page (`/tasks`) with status/agent/priority filters. TaskDetail page renders output with markdown.

### Dual Alarm System

Durable Objects support only one alarm at a time. The runtime schedules whichever comes first — the next report or the next task check — and stores the type in `pending_alarm_type` (`"daily"`, `"weekly"`, or `"task"`). After each alarm fires, it re-schedules the next one.

Task checks are staggered by agent ID hash (0–14 minute offset) to avoid thundering herd on D1.

### Implementation Files

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `packages/shared/src/types/task.ts` | Task, TaskProposal, TaskDecision, TaskOutput types |
| `migrations/0007_create_tasks.sql` | D1 tasks table + indexes + model_settings seed |
| `workers/runtime/src/prompt-builder.ts` | Injects pending tasks + `taskProposals[]` schema into report prompts |
| `workers/runtime/src/meeting-prompt.ts` | Injects task queue + `taskDecisions[]` schema into CEO meeting prompts |
| `workers/runtime/src/report-parser.ts` | `parseTaskProposals()` and `parseTaskDecisions()` |
| `workers/runtime/src/task-prompt.ts` | `buildTaskExecutionPrompt()` — persona-aware prompt for task execution |
| `workers/runtime/src/agent-do.ts` | `executeNextTask()`, dual alarm scheduling, task proposal insertion |
| `workers/runtime/src/agent-tools.ts` | `query_tasks` tool definition |
| `workers/dashboard/src/pages/Tasks.tsx` | Tasks list page with filtering and inline actions |
| `workers/dashboard/src/pages/TaskDetail.tsx` | Task detail page with rendered output |
| `workers/dashboard/worker/index.ts` | Task CRUD API endpoints |

### API Endpoints

| Method | Route | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/api/tasks` | List tasks (filterable by `status`, `assignedTo`, `createdBy`) |
| `GET` | `/api/tasks/:id` | Get single task |
| `POST` | `/api/tasks` | Create task manually |
| `PUT` | `/api/tasks/:id` | Update task (status, priority, assignee) |
| `GET` | `/api/tasks/stats` | Task counts by status |

### Manual Task Trigger

`POST /trigger-task/:agentId` on the runtime worker triggers immediate task execution for testing. The agent picks its highest-priority queued task and executes it.

## Exec Visibility (Private Channels)

Private Slack channels are treated as exec-level content. Events from private channels are tagged `["exec"]` and only visible to agents with `"visibility": "exec"`.

- **Tagging**: The Slack connector automatically tags events from private channels with `"exec"` in the `tags` field. No configuration needed — any private channel the bot is invited to becomes an exec source.
- **Agent filtering**: At report generation time, the runtime excludes exec-tagged events from agents without `"visibility": "exec"`. Exec agents see everything.
- **Dashboard obfuscation**: The connection detail page shows exec events with an amber "Exec" badge, replaces the summary with *"Private channel activity"*, and hides the actor and project fields.
- **Manual invite required**: The bot cannot auto-join private channels. An admin must manually invite the OpenChief bot to each private channel they want monitored.
- **Default exec agents**: CEO, CFO, CISO, CRO, Head of HR ship with `"visibility": "exec"`.

See `agents/CLAUDE.md` for full setup instructions.

## Identity Management

The Team page (`/team`) shows all identity records — cross-platform user profiles that link GitHub, Slack, Discord, Figma, and other accounts into a single person. Superadmins can merge duplicate identities, promote/demote exec roles, and hide irrelevant entries.

### Identity Sync (Connectors → D1)

Each connector syncs user profiles into the `identity_mappings` D1 table using a 3-tier matching strategy:

1. **Match by platform username** (e.g., `github_username`) — update existing record
2. **Match by email** — link the new platform account to an existing identity
3. **No match** — insert a new identity record

Name preservation: both connectors use `COALESCE(?, real_name)` so a Slack-sourced full name is never overwritten by a GitHub username fallback. The `display_name` column is only set when the source has a real display name (not a username).

- **Slack connector** (`workers/connectors/slack/src/identity-sync.ts`): Syncs all workspace members. Slack is typically the richest source of real names and avatars.
- **GitHub connector** (`workers/connectors/github/src/identity-sync.ts`): Discovers users via org members endpoint (fast) or falls back to repo contributors. Skips bot accounts.

Both connectors expose a `?task=identity` mode for on-demand sync from the dashboard's "Sync Humans" button on each connector's detail page.

### Display Name Logic

The Team page picks the best display name using `bestName()`: it returns the longer of `displayName` and `realName`, since the longer string is more likely to be the full name (e.g., "Sean Waters" over "Sean").

### Superadmin Role

The superadmin is determined by the `SUPERADMIN_EMAIL` wrangler var. The email matching is case-insensitive. Superadmins can:

- **Promote/demote exec** — toggle a person's role between `exec` and none
- **Hide/show identities** — toggle `is_active` to remove clutter from the team page (hidden identities still exist in D1 and retain all cross-platform links)
- **Merge identities** — combine two identity records into one (select two checkboxes, first selected = primary)
- **Manage connections** — all `/api/connections/*` routes are superadmin-only

### Identity API Endpoints

| Method | Route | Auth | Description |
|--------|-------|------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/api/identities` | Any authenticated | List all identities (returns `role` with superadmin resolved by email) |
| `POST` | `/api/identities/merge` | Superadmin | Merge two identities (`{ primaryId, secondaryId }`) |
| `PUT` | `/api/identities/:id/role` | Superadmin | Set role (`{ role: "exec" \| null }`) |
| `PUT` | `/api/identities/:id/active` | Superadmin | Hide/show identity (`{ isActive: boolean }`) |

### Hiding Identities

Hidden identities (`is_active = 0`) are filtered out of the Team page by default. Superadmins see a "Show hidden (N)" toggle that reveals them with a "Hidden" badge and an eye icon to unhide. Hiding is soft — the identity record remains in D1 and retains all cross-platform links, event attribution, and merge history.

### Implementation Files

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `workers/dashboard/worker/index.ts` | Identity API endpoints (list, merge, role, active) |
| `workers/dashboard/src/pages/Team.tsx` | Team page UI (table, filters, merge, hide/show, bestName) |
| `workers/connectors/github/src/identity-sync.ts` | GitHub → D1 identity sync (org members or repo contributors) |
| `workers/connectors/slack/src/identity-sync.ts` | Slack → D1 identity sync (workspace members) |

## Configuration System

- `openchief.example.config.ts` — Template with all required fields
- `openchief.config.ts` — User's actual config (gitignored)
- `scripts/generate-config.ts` reads the config and writes `wrangler.jsonc` files for all workers
- Config covers: instance identity, Cloudflare resource IDs, runtime settings, auth, GitHub repo, connector enablement

### Worker Name Prefix

All worker names, service bindings, Durable Object script references, and D1 database names use a configurable prefix (default: `"openchief"`). Set `cloudflare.workerNamePrefix` in your config to use a different prefix:

```typescript
cloudflare: {
  workerNamePrefix: "openchief-internal", // → openchief-internal-runtime, openchief-internal-dashboard, etc.
}
```

The `generate-config.ts` script replaces all `openchief-` references in `wrangler.jsonc` files with `{prefix}-`. This ensures service bindings (e.g. dashboard → runtime) always reference the correct worker names. **This is critical** — a mismatch here means the dashboard calls a stale/nonexistent worker.

## Auth

Three auth modes, configured via `auth.provider` in `openchief.config.ts`:

| Mode | How It Works | Best For |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `"none"` | Open access, no login | Local dev, VPN-protected instances |
| `"cloudflare-access"` | Cloudflare Zero Trust SSO at the edge | Teams with existing CF Access / identity providers |
| `"password"` | Single admin password with cookie-based sessions | Simple deployments (recommended default) |

### Password Auth

- Password stored as a Wrangler secret (`ADMIN_PASSWORD`)
- Sessions use HMAC-SHA256 signed cookies (`oc_session`, 7-day TTL, HttpOnly + Secure + SameSite=Lax)
- Session token format: `email|expiry|hmac_hex` — signed with `ADMIN_PASSWORD` via Web Crypto API
- Login page at `/login`, logout button in sidebar
- All `/api/*` routes (except `/api/auth/*`) require a valid session cookie

### Cloudflare Access Auth

- CF Access injects `cf-access-authenticated-user-email` header at the edge after SSO
- Worker middleware rejects API requests missing this header (returns 401)
- Frontend redirects unauthenticated users to `https://<teamDomain>/cdn-cgi/access/login`
- `CF_ACCESS_TEAM_DOMAIN` wrangler var tells the frontend where to redirect
- Requires creating an Access application in the CF Zero Trust dashboard (not automated — the deploy script prints step-by-step instructions with the dashboard URL)

### Auth Implementation Files

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `workers/dashboard/worker/index.ts` | Env bindings, session helpers (HMAC), auth middleware, 3 auth endpoints, async `getUserEmail()` |
| `workers/dashboard/src/lib/auth.tsx` | `AuthProvider` context + `useAuth()` hook — checks `/api/auth/session` on mount |
| `workers/dashboard/src/components/RequireAuth.tsx` | Route guard — redirects to `/login` (password) or CF Access login URL |
| `workers/dashboard/src/pages/Login.tsx` | Password login page |
| `workers/dashboard/src/components/AppSidebar.tsx` | Logout button (password mode only) |
| `workers/dashboard/src/lib/api.ts` | 401 response triggers `window.location.reload()` to re-enter auth flow |

### Auth API Endpoints

| Method | Route | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/api/auth/session` | Returns `{ authenticated, provider, email?, teamDomain? }` — always accessible |
| `POST` | `/api/auth/login` | Password auth only — constant-time compare, sets session cookie |
| `POST` | `/api/auth/logout` | Clears session cookie (Max-Age=0) |

### Wrangler Vars & Secrets

| Name | Type | Mode | Description |
|------|------|------|-------------|
| `AUTH_PROVIDER` | var | All | `"none"`, `"cloudflare-access"`, or `"password"` |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | secret | password | The admin password (set via `wrangler secret put`) |
| `CF_ACCESS_TEAM_DOMAIN` | var | cloudflare-access | Team domain for login redirect (e.g. `your-team.cloudflareaccess.com`) |
| `SUPERADMIN_EMAIL` | var | All | Email of the superadmin user (case-insensitive). Grants identity management, connection management, and role promotion capabilities. |

### Identity Resolution

Regardless of auth mode, user email is resolved via the `identity_mappings` D1 table for display names, avatars, team, and role. Falls back to email prefix if no identity found. The superadmin role is resolved by matching the user's email against the `SUPERADMIN_EMAIL` wrangler var. See "Identity Management" section for full details on identity sync, merge, and role management.

## Database (D1)

7 migration files in `migrations/`:
- `events` — All normalized events from all connectors
- `agent_definitions` — Agent configs (JSON)
- `agent_subscriptions` — Source + event type patterns per agent
- `reports` — Generated reports with content JSON
- `agent_revisions` — Change history for agent configs
- `identity_mappings` — Cross-platform user identity (GitHub, Slack, Discord, Figma, Jira, Notion). Key columns: `role` (superadmin/exec/null), `is_active` (1/0 for hide/show), `is_bot`, `team`
- `model_settings` — Per-job-type AI model configuration
- `tasks` — Agent-proposed work items with CEO prioritization and autonomous execution. Key columns: `status` (proposed/queued/in_progress/completed/cancelled), `priority` (0-100), `created_by`, `assigned_to`, `output` (JSON)

## Caching (KV)

| Key Pattern | TTL | Used By |
|-------------|-----|---------|
| `report:{agentId}:latest` | 5 min | Dashboard (latest report) |
| `subscriptions:all` | — | Runtime (invalidated on agent change) |
| `avatar:{agentId}` | — | Dashboard (agent avatars) |
| `identity:index` | 5 min | Router (identity resolution) |
| `slack:user:{userId}` | 24 hr | Slack connector (user cache) |
| `slack:channels:list` | 1 hr | Slack connector (channel cache) |
| `slack:backfill:cursor` | — | Slack connector (polling state) |
| `poll:cursor:{repo}` | — | GitHub connector (polling state) |
| `connector-secret:{source}:{field}` | — | Dashboard (secret metadata) |

## Naming Conventions

- Worker names: `openchief-runtime`, `openchief-router`, `openchief-dashboard`, `openchief-connector-{source}`
- Queue: `openchief-events`
- D1: `openchief-db`
- Package: `@openchief/shared`
- Agent IDs: kebab-case (`eng-manager`, `data-analyst`)
- Event types: dot-notation (`pr.opened`, `message.posted`, `build.failed`)
- Sources: lowercase (`github`, `slack`, `jira`, `google-analytics`)

## Development & Deploy Workflow

OpenChief is an open-source package — the source repo (`~/dev/openchief`) uses placeholder values for all Cloudflare resource IDs. A separate deploy directory (`~/dev/openchief-deploy`) holds the real deployed instance with actual resource IDs. **Never deploy directly from the source repo.**

### Workflow

1. **Edit** code in `~/dev/openchief/` (the source repo)
2. **Build** from the source repo: `pnpm build`
3. **Copy** the changed worker(s) to the deploy directory:
   ```bash
   rsync -av --exclude node_modules --exclude .wrangler --exclude wrangler.jsonc ~/dev/openchief/workers/<worker>/ ~/dev/openchief-deploy/workers/<worker>/
   ```
   **IMPORTANT:** Always exclude `wrangler.jsonc` — the deploy directory has real Cloudflare resource IDs and secrets that must never be overwritten by the source repo's placeholders.
4. **Deploy** from the deploy directory:
   ```bash
   cd ~/dev/openchief-deploy/workers/<worker> && npx wrangler deploy
   ```
5. **Commit & push** from the source repo (which keeps placeholder values)

### Why Two Directories

- The source repo is open-source and must never contain real account IDs, database IDs, KV namespace IDs, or secrets
- The deploy directory has `wrangler.jsonc` files with real Cloudflare resource IDs filled in
- The Vite/Cloudflare build plugin for the dashboard generates a `dist/` config that references the source directory — if deploy configs get stale, delete `.wrangler/deploy/config.json` in the deploy directory and use a manually configured `wrangler.jsonc` with real IDs
- The deploy directory is not a git repo — it's a deployment staging area only

### Deploy Directory Resource IDs

Real Cloudflare resource IDs and deploy vars are stored in `.claude/CLAUDE.md` (gitignored). Check there or read from the existing deploy dir `wrangler.jsonc` files. Never guess or invent resource IDs.

## Auth (Worker HTTP Endpoints)

Every worker with HTTP endpoints **must** authenticate non-health-check routes:

1. Add `ADMIN_SECRET: string` to the worker's `Env` interface
2. Import `requireAdmin` from `@openchief/shared` and guard routes:
   ```typescript
   import { requireAdmin } from "@openchief/shared";
   // ...
   const denied = requireAdmin(request, env.ADMIN_SECRET);
   if (denied) return denied;
   ```
3. Health check routes (`GET /`, `GET /health`) remain public — they return before the auth guard
4. Webhook endpoints use signature verification (HMAC-SHA256, Ed25519) instead of Bearer tokens
5. OAuth callback endpoints are necessarily public (state-verified by the OAuth provider)
6. Add `{ name: "ADMIN_SECRET", label: "Admin Secret", secret: true }` to `CONNECTOR_CONFIGS` in the dashboard worker
7. Set the secret via `wrangler secret put ADMIN_SECRET`

The dashboard proxies to connectors and the runtime via service bindings, injecting `Authorization: Bearer {secret}` from KV or wrangler secrets. Direct access to any worker's `*.workers.dev` URL without a valid Bearer token returns 401.

## Code Style

- TypeScript strict mode everywhere
- ES2022 target and module
- Bundler module resolution
- Explicit return types on exported functions
- No default exports (except Cloudflare Worker entry points)
- Tailwind CSS v4 with OKLch color space in dashboard
- shadcn/ui component library (Radix primitives + CVA variants)
