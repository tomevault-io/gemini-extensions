# Clauddy — project guide

A cute pixel-art desktop pet (Electron) that tracks Claude Code usage: real session/weekly % (via OAuth login) plus token counts from local logs. macOS-first, with Windows (x64) support and Linux on the way.

## Stack

- **Electron** (frameless, transparent, always-on-top widget)
- **Bun** for install/scripts, **Node 24** (pinned in `.nvmrc`)
- **Biome** for format + lint
- Vanilla JS in `renderer/` (SVG sprite + CSS/WAAPI animations) — no framework

## Layout

- `main.js` — Electron main process (window, usage polling, notifications, file watchers)
- `preload.js` — `contextBridge` API exposed to the renderer
- `usage.js` — reads `~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl` (tokens, session window, activity)
- `auth.js` — OAuth (PKCE) login + authoritative usage % fetch
- `accounts.js` — the account list (several subscriptions, one active at a time)
- `codex.js` — reads Codex's `~/.codex/sessions/**/rollout-*.jsonl` (limits %, tokens, 30-day history). Opt-in from Settings (`config.codex.enabled`); with more than one service connected, tabs under the pet pick which one the whole panel shows
- `cursor.js` — Cursor: usage % from Cursor's (unofficial) dashboard API with the token the Cursor app keeps in its `state.vscdb` (read via `node:sqlite`, `bun:sqlite` in tests), activity from the agent transcripts under `~/.cursor/projects`. Monthly billing cycle, no tokens. Opt-in from Settings (`config.cursor.enabled`)
- `reminders.js` — persistent, one-shot session reset reminders, keyed by provider and Claude account
- `renderer/` — `index.html`, `pet.js`, `style.css` (the pet + UI)
- `renderer/companion.js` — provider activity transitions, with a shared cooldown
- `renderer/voice.js` — the pet's voice: remark lines for the speech bubble and the chiptune blips (Web Audio square waves, no assets). Talk is on by default, sound is opt-in (`config.sound`) and silent in menu-bar mode, collapsed, or muted
- `make-icon.js` — generates the macOS `.icns` from the pixel sprite
- `make-ico.js` — packs the Windows `.ico` (`build-icon.sh` drives both + the Linux `.png`)
- `make-tray.js` — generates the menu-bar (tray) template icon from the same sprite
- `scripts/adhoc-sign.js` — `afterPack` hook: ad-hoc signs the macOS bundle with the real appId, without which macOS silently drops the app's notifications
- `pet` — dev script to simulate pet states (writes `~/.claude-usage-monitor/debug.json`)

## Commands

```bash
bun start          # dev run
bun run pack       # build dist/mac-arm64/Clauddy.app
bun run dist       # macOS zip (used by the release pipeline)
bun run dist:win   # Windows zip — run on Windows/CI (needs a native runner)
bun run dist:linux # Linux tar.gz + AppImage (run on Linux/CI)
bun run icon       # regenerate build/icon.{icns,ico,png} from the sprite
bun run check      # Biome format + lint (autofix)
bun test           # the suite — but prefer `bun run test` (see below)
bun run test       # all three groups, each in its own process
bun run test:coverage
./pet <state>      # simulate a state, e.g. ./pet fire
```

`./pet <state>` states: `fire`, `sleeping`, `working`, `tired`, `idle`, `poke`, `celebrate`, `say`, `auto`, plus the activity scenes `reading`, `editing`, `running`, `planning`, `researching`, `delegating`, `waiting`.

> Windows/Linux artifacts must be built on their own OS (or CI runner) — electron-builder can't reliably cross-build them from macOS. `release.yml` handles that in three stages: `version` (semantic-release dry-run) → `build` (matrix on macOS/Windows/Linux, each stamping the computed version via `scripts/set-version.js`) → `publish` (downloads every artifact and runs semantic-release for real).

## Tests

`bun run test` — three processes, not plain `bun test`:

- `test/unit/` — `usage.js`, `auth.js`, `codex.js`, `cursor.js`, `renderer/burn.js`, `renderer/voice.js`, `renderer/companion.js` (no mocks)
- `test/main/` — `main.js`, with `reminders.js` through it (mocks `electron`, `./usage`, `./auth`, `./codex`, `./cursor`)
- `test/dom/` — `renderer/pet.js`, `preload.js` (happy-dom)

Split because bun mocks are per-runtime and it loads every test file before running any, so a mock in one file reaches the others. Each group must be run by its own path — `bun test` (or `bun test test/`) globs all three into one process and fails.

`bun run test:coverage` gates: 80% total, 60% per file, and no shipped `.js` without coverage. Runs on every PR.

`pet.js`, `burn.js`, `voice.js` and `companion.js` end with a `module.exports` guard so one file works as a `<script>` in the widget and as an import in the tests.

> `main.js`'s update path spawns `curl … | bash` — always stub `child_process.spawn`, or it installs over the running app.

## Data & secrets

- All user data lives in `~/.claude-usage-monitor/` (NOT in the repo): `auth.json` (OAuth token, mode 600), `config.json` (settings), `debug.json` (simulator), `alerts.json` (which notifications are already armed, so restarts don't repeat them), `reset-reminders.json` (one-shot deadlines and recently delivered reminders), `accounts.json` (the account list + the active one).
- Extra accounts nest their own `auth.json`/`alerts.json` under `accounts/<id>/`; the first account keeps the top-level paths, so existing installs are untouched. Switching rebinds `auth.setDataDir`, `usage.setClaudeDir` and the alert state — only the active account is polled, so only it can notify.
- **Never commit** `auth.json` or any token/credential. It's gitignored — keep it that way.

## Code style

- Enforced by Biome: **single quotes**, **no semicolons**, **2-space** indent, LF.
- Run `bun run check` before committing. A pre-commit hook (`.githooks/pre-commit`) auto-formats staged files and blocks on lint errors; it's wired up on `bun install`.
- Match the surrounding style; keep comments short and in English.

## Documentation

Don't hard-wrap Markdown (README, AGENTS.md, CONTRIBUTING, PR and issue bodies): each paragraph or list item goes on a single line, and the editor wraps it on display. Code blocks and tables keep their normal format. Commit messages are the exception: they still wrap at ~72 characters.

## Commits — Conventional Commits

Every commit message MUST follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
<type>(optional scope): <short, imperative description>
```

Allowed types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`, `revert`.

Rules:

- Subject in the imperative mood, lower-case, no trailing period, ≤ ~72 chars.
- One logical change per commit; use the body to explain the "why" when useful.

Examples:

- `feat: add confetti burst on session reset`
- `fix(auth): use platform.claude.com token endpoint`
- `chore: bump Electron to 42.4.1`
- `docs: document the ./pet simulator`

## Before finishing a change

1. `bun run check` is clean.
2. `bun run pack` builds successfully (the app still launches).
3. Commit follows the convention above.

## Companion behavior

- Widget sizes: expanded, compact, and pet-only. `clauddy.size` in localStorage remembers the choice. Pet-only is floating-mode only; hovering over the pet (or focusing it) fades a usage glance in below it, within fixed window bounds, without resizing or moving the window.
- In pet-only mode, the sprite is a native Electron drag region. The expand button inside the glance opens compact, and so does Enter on the focused pet. Pointer clicks on the sprite do not change size. Main sends window-relative cursor coordinates only in this mode, and only when they change: native drag regions suppress DOM hover events. Keep logo descriptions accessible, without visible activity captions or native title tooltips.
- Session reset reminders are explicitly requested, separate from threshold notifications. They run while Clauddy is open and catch up after sleep/restart. They persist before firing, cancel on disconnect/removal, and are account-scoped.
- A deadline alone does not prove a new budget. Only a fresh, lower reading after that deadline earns “budget is back”; otherwise say the reset time arrived. Codex logs and Cursor fetches can be stale. Never substitute an expired reading with zero.
- Compact and pet-only moods follow activity across connected providers, independently of the selected usage tab. Logos identify the workers; simultaneous work uses a stable generic working animation. With no active sources, the hottest connected session sets the mood: on fire past the fire threshold, maxed out at 100%, otherwise rest. The logo of the service on fire (or maxed out) takes the status dot's place. Cursor's session is its billing month. An expired Codex or Cursor reading doesn't count. Stale activity and disconnected sources are ignored.
- Working means an open turn, not a recent write: Claude Code and Cursor write nothing while a command runs or the model thinks. Claude's turn closes on a final answer (`end_turn`, then `system/turn_duration`) or `[Request interrupted by user`; Cursor's on `turn_ended`. Slash commands, `!` shell input, task notices and meta lines open nothing. An open turn untouched for 30 minutes counts as abandoned; a tail that says nothing falls back to the recent-write window.
- Provider cues are a glance of the pet's eyes toward the provider, never a caption. They preserve manual selection and do not claim task completion from inactivity. First reads establish a baseline; cues share a 30-second cooldown.
- `AGENTS.md` is the single source of project instructions.
