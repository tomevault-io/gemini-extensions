# taskwarrior.nvim

Neovim plugin + Python CLI for editing Taskwarrior tasks as markdown.

## Structure
- `bin/taskmd` — Python CLI tool (parser, adapter, render, diff, apply)
- `lua/taskwarrior/init.lua` — thin orchestrator (~273 lines)
- `lua/taskwarrior/{buffer,apply,capture,delegate,review,saved_views,projects,
  completion,commands,help,validate,taskmd,config,views,diff_preview,feedback,
  health,statusline,cmp}.lua` — focused modules (split landed in v1.2.0)
- `lua/telescope/_extensions/task.lua` — Telescope extension (deliberately
  named `task` even after the v1.3.0 rename, because the extension name is
  the user-facing `:Telescope <name>` slug, not the module path)
- `plugin/taskwarrior.lua` — runtime entrypoint (registers `:Task` lazily)
- `doc/taskwarrior.txt` — vim help reference
- `tests/test_taskmd*.py` — Python tests (pytest, 358 tests)
- `tests/lua/spec/*_spec.lua` — Lua tests (plenary busted, 121 assertions)

## Development
- Python tests: `uv run --with pytest python -m pytest tests/ -q --ignore=tests/e2e`
- Lua unit tests: `./tests/lua/bootstrap.sh`
- **Lua e2e tests: `./tests/e2e/run.sh`** — spawns a temp TASKDATA,
  seeds fixtures, drives each feature against a real `task` CLI, and
  validates downstream output (mmdc for Mermaid, task export for
  mutations, window state for floats). **This is where "verified"
  lives**; unit tests catch syntax errors, e2e catches behaviour.
- Integration tests use a temp TASKDATA dir — they don't touch real tasks
- The CLI must have zero external dependencies (stdlib only)
- `lua/taskwarrior/init.lua` should remain a thin orchestrator (≤300 lines);
  business logic belongs in submodules

## Demo Assets
- Render demos: `demo/render-all.sh` (validates tapes + renders + size-checks)
- Validate tapes only: `demo/validate-tapes.sh`
- Never run `vhs` directly — the render wrapper enforces env isolation to prevent leaking real task data
- Pre-commit hook (`.githooks/pre-commit`) blocks commits with unsafe tapes or oversized assets

## Conventions
- Python: type hints, argparse, no external deps
- Lua: follow NvChad/lazy.nvim patterns
- All Taskwarrior commands must include `rc.bulk=0 rc.confirmation=off` to avoid interactive prompts

## Verification — "works" means end-to-end, not "module loads"

Before reporting a feature done, it must be verified against a real
Taskwarrior DB (use the `tw_env` fixture pattern from
`tests/test_taskmd.py`: temp TASKDATA + isolated `.taskrc`). Unit
tests that only assert "module loads", "command registers", or
"helper returns a list" do NOT verify the feature. They catch syntax
errors, nothing else.

**Hard rule: every user-facing flow gets a smoke test.**

A "user-facing flow" is any code path triggered by: a `:Task*` command
callback, a `vim.ui.select` / `vim.ui.input` callback, a buffer-local
keymap (e.g. `g?`, `<CR>`), a global keymap (e.g. `<leader>tF`), or any
popup/picker/buffer the user can hit. For each one, add an entry to
`tests/lua/spec/smoke_user_flows_spec.lua` that:

  1. Stubs `vim.ui.select` / `vim.ui.input` so the flow doesn't block.
  2. Invokes the entry point headlessly (e.g. `tutor.start()`,
     `feedback.last_error()`, the keymap callback).
  3. Drains pending `vim.schedule` callbacks via `vim.wait(50, …)` so
     errors thrown inside scheduled closures fire before the assertion.
  4. Asserts no real Lua / vim API error surfaced — match on
     `Error executing`, `stack traceback:`, `attempt to`, vim error
     codes (`E\d+:`), or specific error fragments like
     `'replacement string'`. **Do not** treat intentional ERROR-level
     `vim.notify()` calls as failures — those are user messages, not
     bugs.

The smoke test bar is "feature does not crash on the happy path of
every selection / argument value". It is intentionally weaker than the
feature-correctness bar (which requires asserting outputs). It exists
to catch the class of bug that ships when unit tests verify primitives
in isolation but no test ever drives the actual user journey.

Concrete example: the v1.4.1 verify-buffer bug
(`'replacement string' item contains newlines` at `init.lua:497`)
shipped because every existing tutor test exercised _begin_session,
_cleanup, the argv prefix, and orphan recovery — but none invoked
`:TaskTutor` and selected "Show me the exact `task` commands first".
The smoke spec added in that commit reproduces the original failure
when the fix is reverted (verified) and is what you must add for any
new user-facing flow before claiming "shipped".

Bar per feature category:

- **Commands that mutate a task** (`:TaskAppend`, `:TaskModifyField`, …):
  seed a task, invoke the command headlessly, `task export` the UUID,
  assert the field changed. Stubbing `vim.ui.input/select` is fine for
  driving the flow.
- **Commands that read and render** (`:TaskGraph`, `:TaskReport`,
  `:TaskInbox`, dashboard, query blocks): actually run a downstream
  validator on the output. For Mermaid, pipe through `mmdc` (it is
  installed). For markdown export, round-trip through `taskmd apply`.
  For reports, assert the buffer contents match the expected filter.
- **Commands with side effects on Neovim state** (`:TaskFloat`, `gf`
  float, embedded query blocks): assert the resulting buffer or window
  exists with the expected properties (`nvim_list_wins`, `nvim_buf_get_lines`).
- **Rendering that places virt_text / signs on buffer lines**
  (relative date chips, overdue badges, urgency bars): checking that
  the extmark *exists* with the right `virt_text_pos` is NOT enough.
  `right_align` draws at the window's right edge unconditionally and
  overwrites buffer text on wrapped long lines. Verify with a
  *geometric* layout check: compute `strdisplaywidth` of the visible
  line content, subtract `strdisplaywidth` of the virt_text, assert
  the first wrap segment doesn't exceed `columns − virt_text_width`.
  See `geometric_overlaps` in `tests/e2e/spec/e2e_spec.lua`.
- **Background behaviour** (granulation auto-stop): drive the real
  timer by advancing `vim.loop.now()`-equivalent or by calling the
  internal check directly; verify `task +ACTIVE export` is empty.
- **Degraded environment — missing or broken hard dependencies**: the
  plugin shells out to `task` (always), `python3`/`bin/taskmd` (live
  diff preview, optional CLI features), `mmdc` (`:TaskGraph`), and
  `claude` (`:TaskDelegate`). Tests must cover the case where each
  binary is absent. **CI installs Taskwarrior at the top of every
  job, and the e2e harness requires `task` for its own seed step**,
  so the only way to exercise the missing-binary path is to monkey-
  patch `vim.fn.executable` in a Lua spec. The plugin must:
  A. emit a clear, actionable `vim.notify(..., WARN)` at startup if
     `task` is missing — not a Lua trace from `vim.fn.system`;
  B. short-circuit `run()` in `taskmd.lua` (and any equivalent
     wrapper) so subsequent calls return `"", 127` without touching
     `vim.fn.system`;
  C. throttle the missing-binary notify to at most one per session
     (no per-call spam);
  D. keep `:checkhealth taskwarrior` as the canonical post-install
     verification path for users who skipped reading the README.
  See `tests/lua/spec/degraded_env_spec.lua`. Issue #2 was a
  manifestation of this gap — `task` not on PATH triggered
  `E475: Invalid value for argument cmd: 'task' is not executable`
  with no friendly fallback. Any new external-binary dep added in
  the future (mmdc, claude, future Rust helpers) **must** ship with
  a parallel degraded-env spec; otherwise the same class of bug
  reappears the moment a user installs the plugin without that dep.

- **Concurrent state — external Taskwarrior changes**: the plugin is
  not the only writer. CLI `task add`, mobile sync, another editor, or
  a background hook can mutate Taskwarrior between the time we render
  a buffer and the time the user saves it. Any change to the save
  path (`compute_diff`, `M.apply`, `apply.on_write`) must hold the
  line against these scenarios:
  A. external `task add` between render and save → not marked done/deleted;
  B. external `task modify` adding a field → field survives the save;
  C. externally completed task whose UUID is still in the buffer →
     no pending duplicate resurrected;
  D. both sides modified same task → conflict surfaced, buffer does
     not silently overwrite external;
  E. `--force` / `:w!` preserves the destructive escape hatch;
  F. no external change → ordinary edits still apply (control).
  See `tests/e2e/spec/external_changes_spec.lua` (Lua round-trip),
  `tests/lua/spec/diff_external_changes_spec.lua` (pure compute_diff),
  and `TestIntegrationConflicts` in `tests/test_taskmd_extended.py`
  (Python mirror). Taskwarrior timestamps have 1-second precision;
  e2e tests must `sleep 1.2s` between render and external mutation
  to make `modified > rendered_at` hold reliably.

"Runs the test suite and all tests pass" is necessary but not sufficient
— the test suite must exercise the feature's real effect, not just its
existence. When the user says "verify all features," expand the test
suite to cover each feature's observable behaviour, don't just run what
already exists. Do not claim a feature is verified if the only check is
that `pcall(require, "taskwarrior.foo")` returned true.
