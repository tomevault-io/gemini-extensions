# UniFi Toolkit

## Overview
FastAPI-based web dashboard for UniFi network management and monitoring. Deployed via Docker (Synology NAS, Unraid, etc.).

## Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Python 3.9+, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy (async, SQLite), Alembic migrations, aiohttp (UniFi API)
- **Frontend:** Jinja2 templates, vanilla JS (main dashboard), Alpine.js (Network Pulse)
- **Auth:** Optional session-based auth (production mode)

## Key Patterns

### Version Management
Version is maintained in THREE files — keep them in sync:
- `pyproject.toml` → `version = "X.Y.Z"`
- `app/__init__.py` → `__version__ = "X.Y.Z"`
- `app/main.py` → `version="X.Y.Z"` (FastAPI constructor)

### UniFi API Client (`shared/unifi_client.py`)
- **UniFi OS only** — legacy standalone controller support was removed in v1.11.0 (aiounifi dependency dropped)
- All API calls use `/proxy/network/api/` prefix via aiohttp
- Health endpoint returns subsystems: wan, wan2+, lan, wlan, vpn, www
- WAN detection is dynamic via `startswith('wan')` — supports N WANs
- **Signal strength:** UniFi API returns separate `rssi` and `signal` fields — use `signal` (matches console display) with `rssi` fallback
- **v2 traffic-flows payload:** The v2 endpoint supports a filtered payload format with `pageNumber`/`pageSize`/`timestampFrom`/`timestampTo` and a `policy_type` array for server-side filtering (e.g., `["INTRUSION_PREVENTION"]` for IPS-only events). The old `limit`/`offset`/`timeRange` format returns ALL flows unfiltered. Auto-detection via `_v2_uses_new_payload` flag handles both formats.

### Schema Repair (`run.py → _repair_schema()`)
- Runs on every startup after Alembic migrations
- Safety net for when `create_all` causes Alembic to stamp-to-head, skipping ADD COLUMN ops
- Must cover ALL migration-added columns — when adding a new Alembic migration that adds a column, also add it to `_repair_schema()`
- Uses `_add_missing_columns()` helper — pass table name and dict of `{col_name: col_sql}`

### Threat Watch Retention & Purge
- Events older than 30 days are auto-purged by the scheduler (runs at most once per hour, piggybacks on the 60s refresh cycle)
- `RETENTION_DAYS` and `PURGE_INTERVAL_SECONDS` constants in `tools/threat_watch/scheduler.py`
- Frontend defaults to 7-day view via `time_range` filter; backend supports `24h`, `7d`, `30d`

### Debug Info (`/api/debug-info`)
- Returns non-sensitive system info (versions, deployment, gateway, firmware) for issue reporting
- Dashboard footer has "Debug Info" link → modal with copy-to-clipboard
- "Report Issue" link also uses this endpoint to pre-populate GitHub issues

### Firmware Compatibility
- **Only stable/GA UniFi firmware is supported** — Early Access (EA) firmware frequently changes API endpoints without notice
- Do NOT suggest users switch firmware channels or attempt to support EA builds
- When users report API issues, firmware version is the first thing to check (now included in debug info)

### Data Flow (Dashboard)
```
UniFi Controller → unifi_client.py (get_health, get_system_info)
  → /api/system-status endpoint (main.py)
  → dashboard.html JS (fetches every 60s)
```

### Threat Watch Data Flow
```
UniFi Controller → get_traffic_flows() → _normalize_v2_event() (flattens to legacy field names)
  → get_ips_events() returns normalized events
  → scheduler.parse_unifi_event() → _parse_legacy_ips_event() (single parser for both v2 and legacy)
  → ThreatEvent DB model
```
All v2 events are normalized before the scheduler sees them — the scheduler only has one parser.

### Network Pulse
- Uses its own scheduler for background polling
- Alpine.js for reactive frontend
- Models in `tools/network_pulse/models.py`
- Extra WANs stored in `NetworkHealth.extra_wans` dict

## Completed Work

### v1.11.2
- Fix Network Pulse chart panels not resizing responsively (#96) — `min-width: 0` on `.chart-card` and `overflow: hidden` on `.chart-container` fix CSS Grid min-width:auto gotcha that prevented canvas-based chart cards from shrinking on narrow viewports
- Remove legacy standalone controller references from README and INSTALLATION.md (#97) — added UniFi OS requirement callout, removed port 8443 examples, lifted Python 3.13 restriction, reordered auth to lead with API key

### v1.11.1
- Fix Threat Watch missing geo/category data from v2 API (#79) — `source.region` mapped to country code (was looking for nonexistent `source.country`), `ips.category_name` mapped to category (was using `ips.ips_category` which only exists in `policies[]`)
- Document that `unifi.ui.com` cloud access is not supported — controller URL must be a local IP/hostname (README.md and INSTALLATION.md)
- Merged Dependabot PRs #93 (docker/metadata-action v5 → v6) and #94 (docker/build-push-action v6 → v7)
- Remove dead `_parse_v2_traffic_flow()` from Threat Watch scheduler — was unreachable since v2 events are pre-normalized to legacy format by `_normalize_v2_event()` before reaching the scheduler

### v1.11.0
- Drop legacy standalone controller support (#92) — removed aiounifi dependency entirely, all API calls now use direct aiohttp requests to UniFi OS endpoints
- Remove Python 3.13 version block from `setup.sh` — the aiounifi constraint was the only reason for the block
- Simplify `shared/unifi_client.py` — removed all `if self.is_unifi_os:` URL conditionals and legacy `else` branches
- Update Dependabot config — removed aiounifi ignore rules and Python version pinning

### v1.10.3
- Fix UAP-AC-LR model mapping (#89) — `U7LR` model code was incorrectly mapped to "U7 LR" (WiFi 7 product); corrected to "UAP AC LR" and added `G7LR` → "U7 LR" for the actual WiFi 7 U7 Long-Range AP
- Add access point model codes to debug info — `/api/debug-info` now includes AP names, raw model codes, and display names; shown in Debug Info modal and Report Issue template for faster diagnosis
- Closed #85 (all reporters confirmed on EA firmware — not supported)

### v1.10.2
- Enhance Threat Watch test-fetch diagnostics (#85) — test both v2 payload formats independently, capture rejection body, total flow count, sample flow keys, and nested structure for faster remote debugging
- Add gateway firmware version to debug info — `get_gateway_info()`, `/api/debug-info` endpoint, Debug Info modal, and Report Issue template
- Closed #90 (shipped in v1.10.1)
- #85 root cause identified for one reporter: Early Access firmware (UniFi OS 5.0.16, Network 10.2.78) — EA not supported, v2 traffic-flows endpoint doesn't exist on EA builds

### v1.10.1
- Add `_FILE` env var support for Docker Swarm secrets (#86) — reads secret values from files (e.g., `ENCRYPTION_KEY_FILE=/run/secrets/key`) for orchestrators that mount secrets as files
- Supported vars: `ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `AUTH_USERNAME`, `AUTH_PASSWORD_HASH`, `DATABASE_URL`, `UNIFI_PASSWORD`, `UNIFI_API_KEY`
- `_FILE` takes precedence if both `VAR` and `VAR_FILE` are set
- Resolved at startup in `run.py` before `.env` loading, so all downstream code (pydantic-settings, `os.getenv()`) works without modification
- Merged Dependabot PR #88 (actions/stale v9 → v10)
- Fix Express in AP-only mode missing from Network Pulse AP detail list (#90) — `get_ap_details()` now includes `device_mode_override=mesh` check matching `get_access_points()` and `get_system_info()`
- Remove UI Product Selector card from dashboard (service shut down) — info cards moved to dedicated full-width `.info-row` for balanced 3+2 layout

### v1.10.0
- Add multi-WAN support to Network Pulse (#83) — per-WAN IP (click-to-reveal), throughput tabs, latency, and uptime for dual/multi-WAN setups
- WAN tab selector in Current Throughput section (hidden for single-WAN, zero visual change)
- Extra WAN entries in WAN Status card and Network Health panel with availability and latency
- Fix Threat Watch external links not opening (#79) — `@click.prevent` modifier was unconditionally blocking navigation on AbuseIPDB, VirusTotal, and Shodan links
- Closed #71 (shipped in v1.9.21), #78 (acknowledged, closed as not planned), #83 (shipped), #80 (moved to Discussions)
- #79 partially fixed (links); geo/category data issues pending reporter feedback on raw API response

### v1.9.21
- Fix UniFi Express in AP-only mode not detected as AP (#71) — Express reports `type: "udm"` with `device_mode_override: "mesh"` when in AP mode
- Skip Express with `device_mode_override: "mesh"` as gateway candidate in `get_system_info()`, `get_gateway_info()`, and `has_gateway()`
- Count Express in AP mode as AP in device counts and `get_access_points()`
- Merged PR #68 (greenlet dependency), closed PR #69 (auto dark mode — not needed after v1.9.19 theme fix)
- Closed #55 (user resolved), #75 (shipped in v1.9.20), #77 (shipped in v1.9.20)

### v1.9.20
- Add Threat Watch time range dropdown — 24h / 7d (default) / 30d filter in filter bar, scopes both events table and stat cards (#75)
- Add `time_range` query param to `/api/events` and `/api/events/stats` endpoints
- Auto-purge threat events older than 30 days — runs hourly via scheduler to keep DB size in check
- Fix Threat Watch webhook delivery — scheduler was calling WiFi Stalker's `deliver_webhook` instead of `deliver_threat_webhook`, causing `custom_message` kwarg error on real alerts while test webhooks worked fine (#77)
- Closed #66 (feature request — not planned), #73 (shipped in v1.9.19), #74 (shipped in v1.9.19)

### v1.9.19
- Remove placeholder text from form inputs for accessibility — users with cognitive disabilities may confuse placeholders with filled-in fields (#73)
- Replace format-hint placeholders with visible `<small>` hint text below inputs; add `aria-describedby` for screen readers
- Keep search box placeholders (standard UX pattern); remove all others across dashboard, login, WiFi Stalker, and Threat Watch
- Add "update available" notification badge in dashboard header (#74)
- New `/api/update-check` endpoint fetches latest GitHub release, compares against running version, caches result for 1 hour
- Badge appears left of theme toggle with version number and links to GitHub release page
- Graceful failure: badge silently hidden if GitHub is unreachable, network is isolated, or no GitHub releases exist yet
- Fix Network Pulse theme default — was defaulting to dark mode instead of matching dashboard's light default

### v1.9.18
- Fix Threat Watch getting 0 IPS events — use correct v2 traffic-flows payload format with server-side `policy_type: ["INTRUSION_PREVENTION"]` filtering instead of paginating all flows and filtering client-side (#63)
- Pass scheduler timestamps through to v2 API (previously hardcoded to `timeRange: "24h"`)
- Add backward-compatible fallback (`_v2_uses_new_payload` flag) for older firmware that may not support the filtered payload format
- Add `payload_format` diagnostic field to debug endpoint
- Fix WiFi Stalker table overflow — long hostnames no longer push delete button off-screen (#72)
- Add `curl` dependency check to `upgrade.sh` preflight (#70)
- Responded to #71 (Express in AP mode) requesting debug info from reporter

### v1.9.17
- Fix WiFi Stalker signal strength mismatch — use UniFi API `signal` field instead of `rssi` to match console display (#60)
- `get_clients()` now captures both `signal` and `rssi` fields; scheduler and client summary prefer `signal` with `rssi` fallback
- Closed #58, #62, #65 with v1.9.16 fixes confirmed

### v1.9.16
- Fix dashboard gateway detection: prioritize dedicated gateways over Express devices in AP mode (#58)
- Add `UDMA69B` as UX7 actual API model code — confirmed by reporter in #62
- Move `EXPRESS_MODEL_CODES` to module level in `unifi_client.py` for shared use between `get_system_info()` and `get_gateway_info()`
- Fix Network Pulse accessibility contrast — bumped `--text-muted` and `--text-secondary` to meet WCAG AA (#65)
- Add stale issues GitHub Actions workflow (7d stale warning, 7d auto-close)

### v1.9.15
- Fix schema repair to cover all 18 migration-added columns — existing users upgrading were hitting missing column errors (#64)
- Add UniFi Express 7 (UX7) IDS/IPS support — model code added to supported gateways (#62)
- Add "Debug Info" modal to dashboard footer — one-click copy of system info for issue reporting

### v1.9.14
- WiFi Stalker: display radio band (2.4/5/6 GHz) in Signal/Type column (#60 partial)
- Added `current_radio` column to TrackedDevice + Alembic migration
- Signal mismatch part of #60 resolved in v1.9.17

### v1.9.13
- Fix Threat Watch column sorting — wired up sort/sort_direction params from frontend to backend API (#61)

### v1.9.12
- Dynamic multi-WAN support for 3+ WAN interfaces (#59)
- Version sync across all three version files

## Troubleshooting UniFi API

### Reverse-Engineering Undocumented Endpoints
The UniFi v2 API is largely undocumented by Ubiquiti. When an endpoint isn't behaving as expected or you need to discover supported parameters:

1. Open the UniFi Network web UI in **Chrome**
2. Right-click → **Inspect** → **Network** tab
3. Navigate to the relevant page in the UI (e.g., Insights → Flows → Threats tab)
4. Find the POST request to the endpoint in the Network tab
5. Click it → **Payload** tab to see the exact JSON body the console sends

This is how we discovered the v2 `traffic-flows` filtered payload format (`policy_type`, `timestampFrom`/`timestampTo`, `pageNumber`/`pageSize`) — the console sends a completely different payload than what was publicly known.

### Known API Quirks
- The legacy `stat/ips/event` endpoint returns 0 on Network 10.x+ — effectively deprecated
- Express in AP-only mode reports `type: "udm"` (not `uap` or `ux`) with `device_mode_override: "mesh"` and `model: "UX"` — detect via `device_mode_override` field
- The `rssi` and `signal` fields are separate values; the console displays `signal`
