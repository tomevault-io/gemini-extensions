This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Qlatt is a WebAudio Klatt formant synthesizer with TTS frontend. It implements the Klatt 1980 synthesizer model using WASM-backed AudioWorklets for DSP processing, driven by a declarative YAML-based configuration system.

## Core Principles

### 1. Explainability Is Not Optional

This is an *explainable* synthesizer. Every decision the system makes — which phoneme target was selected, which rules fired, why F0 is 142 Hz at this instant, why B1 widened here — must be traceable back to a specific rule, a specific paper, and a specific justification.

This is enforced through three interlocking systems:

**Provenance** (`src/provenance.ts`, `src/tts-frontend-provenance.ts`):
- `ProvenanceCollector` records a `DecisionRecord` for every pipeline decision
- Each record has: `stage`, `type`, `subject`, `reason`, `citations[]`, `parents[]`
- Records form a DAG: inventory selection → rule match → rule rewrite, linked by parent IDs
- The rule trace captures every match and rewrite event with the originating token ID

**Citations on rules** (every rule in `public/rules/frontends/<frontend-id>/phases/*.yaml`):
- Every rule has a `citations:` array linking to the paper or source that justifies it
- These citations flow into provenance records automatically via `RULE_CITATIONS` map
- A rule without citations is a bug. If you write a rule, cite its source.

**Tags on rule applications** (the `tag:` field on apply/dispatch entries):
- Tags like `stress`, `consonant_position`, `boundary`, `f0_declination` label what *kind* of modification a rule made
- These feed into diagnostics and provenance, making it possible to ask "why is this vowel short?" and get "duration was multiplied by 0.7 (tag: consonant_position, citation: Klatt 1976 Table III)"

**What this means for you as an agent:**
- When you write a new rule: include `citations:` with the paper reference. No citation = do not commit.
- When you add a rule application: include a `tag:` that describes the linguistic motivation.
- When you add a new pipeline stage: integrate with `ProvenanceCollector` — emit decision records for every non-trivial choice.
- When you modify semantics.yaml realize rules: comment the formula source. `# Fant 1960 Table 2.34-1` is the minimum.
- When you write Rust DSP code: cite the paper in a doc comment at the top of the module. See `crates/aerodynamic-model/src/lib.rs` for the pattern.
- Never introduce a magic number without a citation. If you can't cite it, label it `# engineering estimate` so we know it needs a real source later.

### 2. Always Cite Your Work

When we write code from a paper, cite that paper in the code. This is a specific instance of Principle 1.

The paper library lives in `papers/`. Each paper has a `notes.md` with implementation-focused extractions (equations, parameter tables, algorithms). Before implementing anything from a paper, read `papers/<Author_Year_ShortTitle>/notes.md` first — the extraction work is already done.

### 3. The Diagnostics System

`src/diagnostics.ts` provides runtime diagnostic logging (info/warn/error) with subscriber support. This is separate from provenance — diagnostics are for runtime observations ("warning: F0 clamped to floor"), while provenance is for decision tracing ("F0 set to 142 Hz because rule f0_declination matched, citation: O'Shaughnessy 1976").

When you add new processing stages or error conditions, emit diagnostics. When a parameter is clamped, defaulted, or falls back — that's a diagnostic event.

### 4. Script Repetitive Inspection And Migration Work

Do not rely on long shell or Node one-liners for non-trivial repo analysis, migration, or data inspection. If a task needs more than a simple command, write an actual script in `scripts/` (or another appropriate checked-in location) so the logic is readable, reusable, and reviewable.

**What this means for you as an agent:**
- For repeatable searches, inspections, or report generation: prefer a real script over an inline one-liner.
- For schema migrations or corpus analysis: write a dedicated script and run that script.
- Use one-liners only for genuinely trivial commands (`rg`, `Get-Content`, `git status`, short smoke checks).
- If a throwaway script is only needed temporarily, still make it a normal file first; delete it afterward if it should not stay in the repo.

## Build Commands

```bash
# Build WASM modules (required first)
pwsh -File build.ps1          # Windows
./build.sh                     # Unix

# Run dev server

npm run explain -- "hello world" --verbose  # all decisions
npm run explain -- "hello world" --format json --out report.json  # full JSON
npm run explain -- "hello world" --stage rules  # filter by pipeline stage

```

### Explain Tool Reference

The `explain` CLI (`scripts/explain-phrase.ts`) runs the full TTS pipeline on a phrase and collects every provenance decision. Use it to verify that rules fire correctly, citations exist, and the decision DAG makes sense.

**Flags:**

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--format text\|json` | Output format (default: text) |
| `--verbose` | Show all decisions in text mode (default shows ~40) |
| `--stage <stages>` | Comma-separated filter: `transcribe`, `rules`, `prosody`, `semantics`, `interpreter`, `runtime`, `frontend` |
| `--subject <pat>` | Filter by subject (exact or `prefix*` wildcard) |
| `--range <spec>` | Filter by `seq:START-END`, `time:START-END`, `token:START-END`, or `id:START-END` |
| `--why <id>` | Show ancestry chain for a decision (e.g., `--why d000045`) |
| `--base-f0 <Hz>` | Fundamental frequency (default: 110) |
| `--transition-ms <ms>` | Formant transition duration (default: 30) |
| `--strict-citations` | Exit code 2 if any decisions lack citations |
| `--out <file>` | Write output to file instead of stdout |

## Testing Audio in Chrome

Dev server: `npm run dev` → `http://localhost:8000`

Trigger speech (useful for testing audio):
```javascript
Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('button')).find(b => b.textContent.includes('Speak')).click()
```

## Architecture

### Data Flow

```
Text → normalizeText() → transcribeText() → [inventory lookup]
     → rule phases (postlexical → structural → duration → formant → prosody)
     → assembleKlattTrack() → frames → interpreter → WebAudio Graph
```

1. **TTS Frontend** (`src/tts-frontend.ts`)
   - `normalizeText()` — text normalization (numbers, abbreviations, currency)
   - `transcribeText()` — CMU dictionary lookup + LTS fallback (`src/g2p/`)
   - Inventory lookup — maps phonemes to acoustic targets (`public/rules/inventory.yaml`)
   - Rule phases — declarative YAML rules modify duration, formants, prosody
   - `assembleKlattTrack()` — converts token stream + F0 contour to Klatt frames

2. **Declarative Rule Engine** (`src/declarative-frontend/engine.ts`)
   - Processes rule phases defined in `public/rules/frontends/<frontend-id>/phases/*.yaml`
   - Rule kinds: `scalar` (modify values), `point` (insert F0 targets), `postlexical` (splice/replace tokens), `structural` (expand phonemes into sub-segments)
   - Rules use CEL expressions for conditions and values
   - Navigation: `prev`, `next`, `ahead(n)`, `behind(n)`, `look_back_where()`, `look_ahead_pred()`
   - Every rule has `citations:` and optionally `tag:` for provenance
   - Pipeline configuration: `public/rules/frontends/qlatt-english/frontend.yaml`

3. **Runtime/Interpreter System** (`src/klatt-runtime.ts`, `src/klatt-interpreter.ts`)
   - **Runtime**: Creates WebAudio graph from YAML graph definition
   - **Interpreter**: Schedules track frames to AudioParams
   - Uses CEL expressions for parameter derivation (semantics evaluation)

4. **Legacy Synthesizer** (`src/klatt-synth.ts`)
   - Standalone implementation with hardcoded graph topology
   - Used by test harness, parallel to runtime system

### Declarative Configuration (Bacon IR)

Configuration lives in `experiments/klatt80-baseline/`:

- **`registry.yaml`**: Primitive node definitions (resonator, gain, etc.)
- **`graph.yaml`**: Audio graph topology (nodes + connections)
- **`semantics.yaml`**: Parameter derivation rules using CEL expressions

### Semantics Evaluation Pipeline

```
src/semantics/
├── types.ts              # Type definitions (SemanticsDocument, etc.)
├── cel-evaluator.ts      # CEL expression evaluation (uses cel-js)
├── topological-evaluator.ts  # Dependency-ordered rule evaluation
└── jmespath-resolver.ts  # JMESPath queries (for nested constants)
```

Key concepts:
- **params**: Input parameters (F0, F1, AV, etc.) with defaults/ranges
- **constants**: Static values (ndbScale offsets, correction tables)
- **realize**: CEL expressions that derive output values (e.g., `voiceGain: dbToLinear(GO + AV + ndbScale.AV)`)

The interpreter:
1. Builds context from frame params + constants + defaults
2. Evaluates realize rules in topological order (respecting deps)
3. Applies realized values to bound AudioParams

### WASM Primitives (crates/)

Rust DSP modules compiled to WASM:
- `resonator` - Two-pole formant filter
- `antiresonator` - Two-zero nasal filter
- `lf-source` - Liljencrants-Fant glottal source
- `decay-envelope` - Exponential decay for PLSTEP bursts
- `edge-detector` - Threshold crossing detector
- `signal-switch` - N-to-1 signal selector
- `aerodynamic-model` - Aerodynamic tract model
- `biquad-notch` - Biquad notch filter
- `fujisaki-resonator` - Fujisaki model resonator
- `impulsive-source` - Impulse train source
- `oversampled-glottal-source` - Oversampled glottal source
- `pitch-sync-mod` - Pitch-synchronous modulation
- `reconstruction-filter` - Signal reconstruction filter
- `square-source` - Square wave source
- `tilt-filter` - Spectral tilt filter
- `triangular-source` - Triangular wave source

Shared utilities in `crates/klatt-wasm-common/`.

### Builtin Functions

`src/builtin-functions.ts` is the single source of truth for:
- `dbToLinear()` - Klatt dB conversion (6 dB per doubling)
- `proximity()` - Formant proximity correction
- `ndbScale` - Source amplitude scale factors (includes G0 compensation)

These are registered with the CEL evaluator for use in semantics expressions.

## Important Patterns

### Provenance Integration

When adding new pipeline stages or rules, integrate with the provenance system:

```typescript
// In pipeline code — emit a decision record for every non-trivial choice
provenance.add({
  stage: "rules",                    // "transcribe" | "rules" | "semantics" | "interpreter" | "runtime"
  type: "rule_matched",              // descriptive type string
  subject: `token:${tokenId}`,       // what was affected
  reason: "pre_boundary_lengthening matched (phrase-final sonorant)",
  citations: ["Crystal & House 1988"],
  parents: [parentDecisionId],       // chain to prior decisions
});
```

In YAML rules, every rule must have:
```yaml
my_rule:
  kind: scalar
  select: ...
  apply:
    - field: duration
      op: mul
      value: 1.3
      tag: boundary            # what kind of modification (feeds diagnostics)
  citations:
    - Crystal & House 1988     # justification (feeds provenance)
```

### Ramp vs Step Parameters

Aspiration (AH) and frication (AF) use `linearRampToValueAtTime` for smooth transitions.
Most other parameters use `setValueAtTime` for instantaneous changes.
The semantics marks ramp params with `ramp: true`.

### PLSTEP Burst Mechanism

Plosive releases inject DC step via edge-detector → decay-envelope chain.
Triggered when AF or AH rises by ≥49 dB between frames.

### SW (Cascade/Parallel Switch)

`SW=0` routes through cascade formant chain (vowels).
`SW=1` enables parallel branch (fricatives, stops).
Critical: Branch gains must use `setValueAtTime`, not ramp, for instantaneous switching.
