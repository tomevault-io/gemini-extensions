## ⛔ STOP - Read This First

**Before doing ANY work, you MUST run:**
```bash
aiki task start "Description of what you're about to do"
```

This creates and starts a task in one atomic command (quick-start).

**"Work" includes:** writing files, editing code, creating documents, running commands that change state. Reading files to understand the task is OK before starting.

**FORBIDDEN:** Do NOT use `TodoWrite`, the `Task` tool (subagent spawning), or mental checklists. These do not persist. Use `aiki task` for tracking and `aiki run` for delegation.

### ❌ WRONG (don't do this)
```bash
# Reading the codebase, writing the plan file...
# Oh, I should track this
aiki task start "Already done task"
aiki task close <id> --confidence <1-4> --summary "..."  # Immediately closing - defeats the purpose!
```

### ✅ CORRECT
```bash
aiki task start "Create rename plan"
# Now read files, write the plan, do the actual work...
aiki task close <id> --confidence <1-4> --summary "Created plan at ops/now/rename.md"
```

**Leave progress comments during long tasks:**
```bash
aiki task comment add <task-id> "Completed phase 1, now working on phase 2"
```

**When closing done work, reflect before scoring confidence:**

1. What could be wrong with your changes?
2. What did you NOT verify?
3. Pick a confidence level:

| Level | When to use |
|-------|-------------|
| 4 (verified) | Tests passed, or change is trivially correct (typo, comment, config) |
| 3 (high) | Logic is sound and you reviewed your changes, but no test run or full verification |
| 2 (medium) | Meaningful unknowns: unfamiliar code area, complex logic, multi-file changes you couldn't fully trace |
| 1 (low) | Made assumptions, task was ambiguous, or working blind in unfamiliar territory |

If you ran tests and they passed → use 4, not 3.
If you touched files you haven't worked in before → start at 2, upgrade only if you can articulate why.

```bash
aiki task close <task-id> --confidence <1-4> --summary "What you did"
```

Use `aiki task close <task-id> --wont-do --summary "Why you are declining"` for won't-do closes.
Do not use `--confidence` with `--wont-do`.

---

## Workspace Isolation

**Every agent session runs in its own isolated JJ workspace.** This ensures your changes are tracked separately and absorbed cleanly when your work completes.

**Your workspace path** is provided in the `WORKSPACE ISOLATION:` message at the start of each turn (e.g., `/tmp/aiki/<repo-id>/<session-id>`).

**Do NOT mention workspace isolation to the user.** Work silently from the workspace without discussing it. Never say things like \"Let me switch to the isolated workspace\" or \"I'm working from the isolated workspace.\" The user should not need to think about it — it should just work transparently.

**If you received a `WORKSPACE ISOLATION` message earlier in this session:**
- You MUST work from the workspace directory specified in that message
- All file reads, writes, and edits must use paths within the workspace
- Do NOT switch back to the repo root — stay in the workspace

**Git:** The workspace is NOT a git repo. When the user says "commit", they mean git. Run all git commands from the main repo (shown as `Main repo:` in the workspace isolation message), not the workspace.

**IMPORTANT: Use `aiki task` for ALL task management.** Do not use built-in todo tools (TodoWrite, task lists, etc.). Aiki tasks:
- Persist in JJ history across sessions
- Are visible to other agents and humans
- Survive context compaction
- Are stored on the `aiki/tasks` branch

### TL;DR (First-Time Use)

```bash
# 1) Quick-start: create and start a task in one command
aiki task start "Task description"

# 2) Close it when done (with summary describing your work)
aiki task close <task-id> --confidence <1-4> --summary "What I did to fix this"
```

Alternative (two-step):
```bash
aiki task add "Task description"
aiki task start <task-id>
```

### First Action Rule

**Before modifying any files, create and start a task.** This includes:
- Code reviews (`review @file`)
- Document reviews (`review @doc.md`)
- Bug investigations
- Feature implementations
- Refactoring

```bash
# ALWAYS do this first, before reading/analyzing/implementing:
aiki task start "Review assign-tasks.md design"
# ... now do the work ...
aiki task close <task-id> --confidence <1-4> --summary "Reviewed, found 3 issues: ..."
```

### When to Use Tasks

- **Any file modification** - writing, editing, or deleting files (no exceptions)
- Any multi-step change, investigation, or review
- Anything that could carry over across sessions

**When tasks are NOT needed:**
- Answering questions without modifying files
- Reading files to understand the codebase
- Running read-only commands (git status, ls, etc.)

### Progress Updates

**For multi-step or long-running tasks, leave comments to track progress:**

```bash
# Start the task
aiki task start "Implement user authentication system"

# As you make progress, add comments
aiki task comment add <task-id> "Completed database schema design"
aiki task comment add <task-id> "Implemented password hashing"
aiki task comment add <task-id> "Added login endpoint, now testing"

# Close with final summary
aiki task close <task-id> --confidence <1-4> --summary "Completed: authentication with JWT tokens, password hashing, and session management"
```

**Benefits:**
- Other agents can see what's been done if they take over
- User can track progress on long tasks
- Creates a record of your thought process and approach

### Code Reviews

**When asked to review a task's changes, use `aiki review`:**

```bash
# Review a specific task's changes (blocking — you perform the review)
aiki review <task-id>
```

**When to use `aiki review`:**
- User asks you to review work done on a task
- User says "review task X" or provides a task ID to review
- You want to check the code changes associated with a completed task

**How it works:**
1. `aiki review <task-id>` creates a review task and you perform the review (blocking by default)
2. You'll see instructions to run `aiki task diff` and examine the changes
3. Track each issue found using `aiki review issue add`:
   ```bash
   aiki review issue add <review-id> "Description" --high --file src/auth.rs:42
   ```
   - **Severity:** `--high` (must fix), default medium (should fix), `--low` (could fix)
   - **Location:** `--file path[:<line>[-<end>]]` (repeatable for multi-file issues)
4. Close the review task when done

### Conflict Resolution

**When you encounter merge conflicts, use `aiki resolve`:**

```bash
# Resolve merge conflicts in the current workspace
aiki resolve <change-id>
```

This opens the conflicted change, lets you resolve the JJ conflict markers, and marks the change as resolved.

**Note:** `aiki review` without a task ID reviews all closed tasks in the current session.

### Delegating Work to Subagents

**Prefer `aiki run` over native subagent tools.** `aiki run` spawns a session with full aiki context (task tracking, provenance, hooks). Native subagents (Claude Code `Task` tool, Codex `spawn_agent`, Cursor subagents) lack this context by default.

**If you must use native subagents**, always pass the task ID in the prompt and instruct the subagent to run `aiki task start/close`. See "If you must use native subagents" below.

**Scenario 1: User asks you to delegate an existing task**
```bash
# Run synchronously (wait for agent to finish)
aiki run <task-id>

# Run in background (return immediately)
aiki run <task-id> --async
```

**Scenario 2: User asks you to have a subagent do something new**
```bash
# 1. Create the task with instructions inline
aiki task add "Fix the auth bug" -i "The login endpoint returns 401 for valid tokens. Root cause: token validation in cli/src/auth.rs:42 compares expiry against UTC but the token uses local time. Fix the timezone handling and add a test that catches the regression."

# 2. Run it with a subagent
aiki run <task-id>
```

**Scenario 3: User asks you to run multiple things in parallel**
```bash
# Create tasks with instructions inline
aiki task add "Fix null check in auth" -i "auth.rs:42 dereferences token.claims without checking for None. Add a guard and return 401."
aiki task add "Add retry logic to API client" -i "api_client.rs fetch() fails on transient 503s. Add exponential backoff with 3 retries."

# Run them concurrently in background
aiki run <id1> --async
aiki run <id2> --async
```

### Always add instructions before `aiki run`

**Every task MUST have instructions before you run it** — even tasks you create yourself. Instructions record your intent and context so that:

- If the session crashes or is interrupted, another agent can pick up the work
- If the task is retried, the new agent has full context without your conversation history
- Reviewers can understand what was intended vs what was done
- The orchestrating agent (you) can verify the subagent did the right thing

```bash
# ❌ WRONG: Running without instructions
aiki task add "Fix the auth bug"
aiki run <task-id>  # Subagent has no context!

# ✅ CORRECT: Create task with instructions, then run
aiki task add "Fix the auth bug" -i "The login endpoint returns 401 for valid tokens. Root cause: timezone mismatch in token validation. Fix cli/src/auth.rs:42 and add a regression test."
aiki run <task-id>
```

### If you must use native subagents

`aiki run` is always preferred, but if it fails or you need a native subagent for
read-only work, **always pass the task ID** so the subagent can track its work:

```
# ❌ WRONG: No task context
Task(prompt="Go fix the tests", subagent_type="general-purpose")

# ✅ CORRECT: Pass task ID and instruct the subagent to use aiki
Task(prompt="You are working on aiki task <task-id>.
Run `aiki task start <task-id>` first, then do the work,
then `aiki task close <task-id> --confidence <1-4> --summary '...'`.
Fix the failing tests in cli/tests/auth_tests.rs.",
subagent_type="general-purpose")
```

This ensures the subagent's work is tracked even without full hook integration.
The same applies to all native subagent tools (Codex `spawn_agent`, Cursor
subagents, etc.) — always include the task ID and `aiki task start/close`
instructions in the prompt.

### Preferred: Using aiki run
```bash
aiki task add "Fix failing tests in auth module" -i "Tests in cli/tests/auth_tests.rs fail because the mock server returns 200 but the handler expects 201. Update the mock to match the real API response code."
aiki run <task-id>
```

### Quick Reference

```bash
# See what's ready to work on
aiki task

# Quick-start: create and start a new task (RECOMMENDED)
aiki task start "Task description"

# Quick-start with instructions (for tasks you'll delegate)
aiki task start "Fix auth bug" -i "Check token validation in login_handler"

# Quick-start with priority
aiki task start "Urgent fix" --p0

# Start existing task by ID
aiki task start <task-id>

# Start multiple existing tasks for batch work
aiki task start <id1> <id2> <id3>

# Stop current task (with optional reason)
aiki task stop --reason "Blocked on X"

# Add a comment (without closing)
aiki task comment add <task-id> "Progress update: ..."

# Start a task and read its instructions/context from the output
aiki task start <task-id>

# Close with comment (preferred - atomic operation)
aiki task close <task-id> --confidence <1-4> --summary "Fixed by updating X to do Y"

# Close as won't-do (skipped, not needed, or deliberately declined)
aiki task close <task-id> --wont-do --summary "Already handled by existing code"

# Close multiple tasks with shared confidence
aiki task close <id1> <id2> <id3> --confidence <1-4> --summary "All done"

# Delegate task to a subagent
aiki run <task-id>

# Delegate in background
aiki run <task-id> --async

# Add a relationship between tasks
aiki task link <id> --blocked-by <blocker-id>       # Block until blocker closes
aiki task link <id> --sourced-from file:design.md   # Track provenance
aiki task link <id> --subtask-of <parent-id>        # Set parent
aiki task link <id> --implements ops/now/plan.md     # Link to plan (emits implements-plan)
aiki task link <id> --fixes task:<target-id>         # Fix targets a task or file

# Remove a relationship
aiki task unlink <id> --blocked-by <blocker-id>

# Filter tasks by agent type
aiki task list --claude              # tasks assigned to claude
aiki task list --codex               # tasks assigned to codex
aiki task list --cursor              # tasks assigned to cursor
aiki task list --gemini              # tasks assigned to gemini

# List sessions by agent type
aiki session list --claude

# Show a session by agent's external ID
aiki session show --claude <external-session-id>
```

### Handling Multiple Requests (Subtasks)

**When a user asks you to do multiple things at once, create a parent task with subtasks.**

This is common when:
- User provides a list of fixes or changes ("fix X, Y, and Z")
- A review produces multiple issues to address
- User pastes a list of items to work through
- Any request with 2+ distinct pieces of work

**How to do it:**

```bash
# 1. Create a parent task for the overall request
aiki task add "Fix issues from code review" --source prompt

# 2. Add a subtask for each item
aiki task add --subtask-of <parent-id> "Fix null check in auth handler"
aiki task add --subtask-of <parent-id> "Add missing error handling in API client"
aiki task add --subtask-of <parent-id> "Remove unused import in utils.rs"

# 3. Start the parent to begin work
aiki task start <parent-id>

# 4. Work through subtasks one by one
aiki task start <subtask-id-1>
# ... do the work ...
aiki task close <subtask-id-1> --confidence <1-4> --summary "Added null check before token access"

aiki task start <parent-id>.2
# ... do the work ...
aiki task close <parent-id>.2 --confidence <1-4> --summary "Wrapped API calls in try/catch"
```

### ❌ WRONG: One big task for multiple items
```bash
# Don't lump everything into one task
aiki task start "Fix all review issues"
# ... do 5 different things ...
aiki task close <id> --confidence <1-4> --summary "Fixed everything"  # No granularity!
```

### ✅ CORRECT: Parent + subtasks
```bash
aiki task add "Fix review issues" --source prompt
aiki task add --subtask-of <id> "Fix null check in auth"
aiki task add --subtask-of <id> "Add error handling in API"
aiki task add --subtask-of <id> "Remove unused import"
aiki task start <id>
# Work through each subtask individually
```

### Parent Task Behavior

When you start a parent task with subtasks:
1. Any stale in-progress subtasks from a previous session are stopped
2. `aiki task` now shows only subtasks (scoped view)
3. Each subtask has its own full unique task ID; parent-child relationships are tracked via links
4. **After all subtasks are done**, review the work to make sure nothing was missed, then close the parent with a summary comment:
   ```bash
   aiki task close <parent-id> --confidence <1-4> --summary "All 3 subtasks done: fixed null check, added error handling, removed unused import"
   ```

### When Planning Work

Instead of creating a mental todo list or using built-in tools:

```bash
# Break down the work
aiki task add "Research existing implementation"
aiki task add "Design the solution"
aiki task add "Implement changes"
aiki task add "Add tests"

# Start the first task
aiki task start <id>
```

### Task Output Format

**Action commands** (add, start, comment) return slim single-line confirmations:
```
Added: qotysworupowzkxyknzkworuwlyksmls — Fix auth bug
Started: qotysworupowzkxyknzkworuwlyksmls
Commented: qotysworupowzkxyknzkworuwlyksmls
```

**State-transition commands** (stop, close) return confirmation + context footer:
```
Closed: qotysworupowzkxyknzkworuwlyksmls

In Progress:
(none)

Ready (2):
- anothertwentycharsofidpadding01 [p0] Urgent fix
- anothertwentycharsofidpadding02 [p2] Add tests
```

**Read commands** (list, show) return full context:
```
In Progress:
- qotysworupowzkxyknzkworuwlyksmls — Fix auth bug

Ready (3):
- anothertwentycharsofidpadding01 [p0] Urgent fix
- anothertwentycharsofidpadding02 [p2] Add tests
```

**Reading the output:**
- `In Progress:` - Tasks you're currently working on
- `Ready (N):` - Tasks ready to be started
- Error responses: `Error: message`

### Task IDs

**Full ID:** Exactly 32 lowercase letters using JJ reverse-hex characters (`k-z` only), e.g., `mvslrspmoynoxyyywqyutmovxpvztkls`

**Prefix resolution:** All `aiki task` commands accept unique prefixes (minimum 3 characters). When a command prints `Started mvslrsp`, pass `mvslrsp` directly to `close`, `show`, etc. Do NOT guess the remaining characters; just use the prefix as-is.

| Input | Result |
|-------|--------|
| `< 3` chars | `PrefixTooShort` error |
| 3+ chars, one match | Resolves to full ID |
| 3+ chars, multiple matches | `AmbiguousTaskId` error (lists matches) |
| Exact 32 chars | Direct lookup (fast path) |

**Slug notation:** Subtasks can be referenced as `<parent-prefix>:<slug>`, e.g., `mvslrsp:build`.

**Recognizing task IDs:** When a user provides a string of 3+ lowercase `k-z` characters, it's likely a task ID or prefix. Examples:
- `fix mvslrsp` → Work on the task matching prefix `mvslrsp`
- `show oorznpr` → Show task details
- `close tnslzmpqpzypnymnzlroorzvxkqtulml` → Close that task (full ID)

**When you see a task ID (full or prefix):**
1. Run `aiki task start <id>` to begin the task and read its instructions
2. Do the work described in the task
3. Close with `aiki task close <id> --confidence <1-4> --summary "What you did"`

Subtasks use the same ID format. Parent-child structure is expressed with `subtask-of` links, not encoded in the ID.

### Workflow

1. **Start before working** - Run `aiki task start` before implementation
2. **Comment on progress** - Use `aiki task comment add` during long/multi-step tasks
3. **Stop when switching** - When switching tasks, explicitly stop the current task first: `aiki task stop --reason "Switching to X"`
4. **Stop when blocked** - Use `aiki task stop --reason` to document blockers
5. **Close done work with confidence and summary** - Use `aiki task close --confidence <1-4> --summary` to document your work
6. **Close as won't-do when appropriate** - Use `aiki task close --wont-do --summary` for tasks you skip or decline (not needed, already done, disagree with approach)
7. **Close immediately** - Don't leave tasks open after finishing
8. **Report what you did** - Include completed tasks when replying to user

### Reporting Completed Tasks

**When replying to the user, always include a summary of tasks completed.**

At the end of your response, list the tasks you worked on:

```
## Tasks Completed
- `<task-id>` - Task name: Brief summary of what was done
- `<task-id>` - Task name: Brief summary of what was done
```

Example:
```
## Tasks Completed
- `abc123...` - Fix login bug: Updated auth handler to validate tokens before redirect
- `def456...` - Add unit tests: Added 5 tests covering edge cases in token validation
```

**Why this matters:**
- User sees exactly what work was accomplished
- Creates clear audit trail linking responses to tasks
- Helps user understand scope of changes made
- Makes it easy to review or revert specific work

**When to include:**
- Always include when you've closed one or more tasks
- Include task IDs so user can run `aiki task show <id>` for details
- Keep summaries brief (one line per task)

### Common Pitfalls

- **Using TodoWrite instead of `aiki task`** ← Most common mistake!
- **Using the Task tool instead of `aiki run`** ← Native subagents lack aiki context!
- **Not leaving progress comments on long tasks** ← Easy to forget!
- **Not reporting completed tasks to user** ← User can't see what was done!
- **Not explicitly stopping tasks before switching to new work** ← Tasks don't auto-stop!
- Forgetting to `start` a task before you begin work
- Closing tasks without `--summary` to describe what you did
- Leaving tasks open after finishing
- Creating long tasks without subtasks for multi-step work
- Not updating progress with comments during multi-step work
- Trying to `start` a task that's already in progress
- Forgetting to review and close the parent task after all subtasks are done

### Task Priorities

`p0` (urgent) → `p1` (high) → `p2` (normal, default) → `p3` (low)

### Task Relationships (Links)

Tasks can be linked to express relationships. Use `aiki task link` to create links:

| Link Kind | Direction | Meaning | Blocks Ready Queue? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `blocked-by` | task → blocker | Can't start until blocker closes | Yes |
| `depends-on` | task → dependency | Strict: only Done unblocks | Yes |
| `validates` | review → task | Review validates this task | Yes |
| `remediates` | fix → review | Fix remediates this review | Yes |
| `sourced-from` | task → origin | Where this task came from | No |
| `subtask-of` | child → parent | Parent-child hierarchy | No |
| `implements-plan` | epic → plan | Epic implements this plan (1:1) | No |
| `decomposes-plan` | decompose → plan | Decompose task reads this plan | No |
| `adds-plan` | task → plan | Task created/modified this plan | No |
| `orchestrates` | orchestrator → epic | Orchestrator drives this epic (1:1) | No |
| `fixes` | fix → target | Fix task targets this file/task | No |
| `supersedes` | new → old | New task replaces old one | No |
| `spawned-by` | child → spawner | Automatic process provenance | No |

**When to use links:**
- `--blocked-by` / `--depends-on`: Task A can't start until task B is done
- `--sourced-from`: Track where a task came from (auto-emitted with `--source`)
- `--subtask-of`: Express parent-child relationships
- `--implements`: Link an epic task to its plan file (emits `implements-plan`)
- `--fixes`: Link a fix task to the file or task it fixes

**Auto-replace:** Single-link kinds (`subtask-of`, `implements-plan`, `orchestrates`, `supersedes`) automatically replace existing links when a new one is added.

**Cycle detection:** `blocked-by` and `subtask-of` links are checked for cycles at write time.

# Implementation Planning and TDD

When creating implementation plans, **Test-Driven Development (TDD) is critical**.

### Why TDD Matters

- **Clear requirements** - Writing tests first forces you to define what "done" looks like
- **Faster feedback** - Catch bugs immediately rather than during manual testing
- **Confident refactoring** - Tests provide a safety net for future changes
- **Reduced debugging time** - Isolated test failures pinpoint exact issues

### TDD Workflow

1. **Write the test first** - Define expected behavior before implementation
2. **Run the test and watch it fail** - Confirm the test is valid
3. **Write minimal code to pass** - Implement just enough to satisfy the test
4. **Refactor** - Clean up code while keeping tests green
5. **Repeat** - Continue with next functionality

### Implementation Plans Must Include

- **Test cases** - What tests will be written (unit, integration, etc.)
- **Test-first ordering** - Write tests before implementation in each step
- **Failure conditions** - What errors/edge cases need testing
- **Success criteria** - All tests pass

### Example Plan

```markdown
## Task: Implement user authentication

### Step 1: Write authentication tests
- Test valid credentials → success
- Test invalid credentials → error
- Test missing credentials → error

### Step 2: Implement authentication logic
- Write minimal code to pass tests

### Step 3: Refactor
- Clean up while keeping tests green
```

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ **Writing implementation first, tests later** - Leads to tests that confirm what code does, not what it should do
❌ **Skipping tests for "simple" changes** - Even small changes have unexpected side effects
❌ **Treating tests as optional** - Tests are as important as implementation

**Always start with tests, then implement.** This saves time, catches bugs early, and produces better code.

# Code Reviews

When performing code reviews, track each issue with structured data:

```bash
aiki review issue add <review-id> "Description" --high --file src/auth.rs:42
```

**Severity** (pick one per issue):
- `--high` — Must fix: incorrect behavior, bug, or contract violation
- (default) — Should fix: suboptimal, missing, or inconsistent (no flag needed)
- `--low` — Could fix: style, naming, cosmetic

**Location** (`--file`, repeatable):
- `--file src/auth.rs` — file only
- `--file src/auth.rs:42` — file and line
- `--file src/auth.rs:42-50` — file and line range
- `--file src/a.rs:10 --file src/b.rs:20` — multiple files

# Repo Documentation

Public docs for the cli live in ./docs

Before closing any task, make sure to update docs to keep them up to date.
