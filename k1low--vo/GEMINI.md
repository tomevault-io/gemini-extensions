# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

`vo` is a macOS 26+ Apple Silicon CLI that performs **on-device** live transcription and translation. It listens to the user's microphone and the system speaker output simultaneously, transcribes both streams via Apple's `SpeechTranscriber`, optionally translates each finalized chunk through `TranslationSession`, and prints results to STDOUT. No network calls.

## Build / Run

```bash
swift build                            # debug build, produces .build/debug/vo
swift build -c release --arch arm64    # release
./scripts/build.sh                     # release + embeds Info.plist + ad-hoc codesign
.build/debug/vo --help                 # help
.build/debug/vo --doctor               # environment check (no TCC required)
```

## Test

```bash
./scripts/test.sh                      # Swift Testing suite (swift test under the hood)
```

Tests use Swift Testing (`import Testing`, `@Test`) in `Tests/voTests/`. They cover only the
TCC-free pure logic: `StreamRenderer` JSONL output (source-order commit, volatile suppression,
null-target on EOF), `VoError` messages, and `detectRenderMode`. The audio / Speech / Translation
paths require TCC grants and macOS 26 hardware, so they are not unit-tested.

`scripts/test.sh` exists because on a Command Line Tools-only install (no full Xcode) the Swift
Testing framework and its `lib_TestingInterop` dylib are off the default search / rpath; the script
injects the needed `-F` / `-rpath` flags only when that layout is detected. Under full Xcode (CI's
`macos-26` runner) it runs a plain `swift test`. CI lives in `.github/workflows/test.yml`.

## Runtime requirements

- macOS 26+ (uses `SpeechTranscriber`, `SpeechAnalyzer`, `TranslationSession`, all macOS 26 only)
- Apple Silicon (Neural Engine)
- TCC permissions granted on first run: Microphone, Speech Recognition, and (unless `--no-speaker` is passed) Audio Recording. The speaker channel uses a Core Audio process tap, **not** ScreenCaptureKit, so it needs only the Audio Recording grant, never Screen Recording. When launched from Terminal.app, the grants attach to Terminal.app rather than `vo` itself unless `vo` is properly bundled and signed.
- On-device models. `Pipeline.run()` resolves both before any channel starts (once, since both channels share `--src`). The speech model for `--src` downloads headlessly via `AssetInventory.downloadAndInstall()` on first run, with a one-line `Downloading speech model…` notice on **stderr** (so JSONL on stdout stays clean). The translation model for `--src → --dst` **cannot** be downloaded headlessly (the Translation framework only downloads via a UI sheet a CLI can't present), so `ensureTranslationModel` checks `LanguageAvailability.status` up front and fails fast with `VoError.translationModelNotInstalled` (install via System Settings) or `.unsupportedTranslationPair`, rather than letting every chunk surface `[translation failed]`.

## CLI surface

Flat command (no subcommands). `--doctor` is the only "different mode"; everything else configures the live listen loop.

```
vo [--src LOCALE] [--dst LOCALE] [--no-mic] [--no-speaker]
   [--voice-processing] [--select-device] [--transcript PATH] [--doctor] [--json]
```

- `--src` defaults to `Locale.current.identifier(.bcp47)`. Must be in `SpeechTranscriber.supportedLocales` (all regional, no bare `en` / `ja`). Unsupported values produce a helpful error suggesting matching regional variants.
- `--dst` is optional. Without it, `vo` is transcribe-only and never calls `TranslationSession`.
- `--voice-processing` enables AVAudioInputNode voice processing (echo cancellation + noise reduction). **Default off** because enabling it puts the OS audio session into communication mode and lowers system speaker volume. Use only when running mic + speaker on the same physical device without headphones.
- `--select-device` makes vo prompt for the mic / speaker device at startup instead of using the system defaults. It prints a numbered picker for each enabled channel (mic input from `collectInputDevices()`, speaker output from `collectOutputDevices()`), reads the choice, and **pins** the result. A pinned channel suppresses its `DefaultDeviceChangeListener` (`MicCapture` / `SpeakerCapture`), so a later system-default change is ignored and capture stays on the chosen device. An unpinned channel does the opposite. It follows the system default, and when the default changes mid-session it rebuilds the capture on the new default and keeps feeding the same analyzer (the device-follow loop in `Pipeline.runChannel`, coordinated by `RebindBox`), so the session continues instead of stopping. A pinned device that disappears is not rebuilt, so that channel goes quiet until restart. `MicCapture` pins via `kAudioOutputUnitProperty_CurrentDevice` on the input node's HAL unit; `SpeakerCapture` swaps the aggregate's anchor UID. The picker writes to **stderr** and reads **stdin**, never touching stdout, so `vo --select-device --json | jq` keeps stdout pure JSONL while still selecting interactively. It is gated on `canSelectDevicesInteractively()` (stdin **and** stderr are TTYs; stdout may be piped); otherwise it fails with a `ValidationError`. The prompt runs in `Listen.swift` after the re-exec (so it happens once, in the disclaimed child that owns stdin) and before the banner. Empty input picks the default-marked device. See `DeviceSelection.swift`.
- TCC attribution: vo always re-execs itself as its own TCC responsible process (via the private `responsibility_spawnattrs_setdisclaim`) so the Microphone / Speech / Audio Recording grants attach to vo, not the launching terminal. There is no flag; it runs unconditionally in `Listen.swift` after the `mic || speaker` validation. The re-exec is gated on the embedded `Info.plist` being present (`Responsibility.hasEmbeddedInfoPlist`), so the release / `build.sh` binary claims its own identity while a plain `swift build` binary (no usage descriptions, would be killed on mic access) stays on the terminal's identity. The parent becomes a thin launcher that waits and forwards the child's exit status; any failure falls back to running in-process. Because the released binary is ad-hoc signed, macOS re-prompts after each release (the signing identifier stays `io.github.k1low.vo`, so it's one entry, not duplicates); a stable `VO_CODESIGN_IDENTITY` removes the re-prompt. See `Responsibility.swift`.
- `--json` forces JSONL output. Without it, auto-detects: TTY → ANSI redraw, non-TTY → JSONL.
- `--transcript PATH` streams finalized chunks as JSONL into `PATH`. Without it, vo streams the same JSONL into a temp file under `TMPDIR` and at Ctrl-C asks `Save transcript to ./vo-<stamp>.jsonl? [Y/n/<path>]`. If the chosen target (or `PATH` itself) exists, vo prompts `Overwrite? [y/N]`. Memory usage stays bounded across long sessions because nothing is buffered.

## Architecture

The whole pipeline is one TaskGroup orchestrating two parallel channels (mic + speaker) that feed a single `Renderer` actor.

### Files in `Sources/vo/`

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `Vo.swift` | `@main` `AsyncParsableCommand`. Pure flag-parse and dispatch to either `runListen` or `runDoctor`. |
| `Listen.swift` | Entry point for the main capture loop. Sets up `StreamRenderer`, `Pipeline`, SIGINT handler, banner, exit summary. |
| `Pipeline.swift` | The TaskGroup orchestration. Spawns `runChannel(.mic, …)` and `runChannel(.speaker, …)` concurrently. Each channel constructs its own `SpeechTranscriber`, `SpeechAnalyzer`, and (if translating) `TranslationSession`. **Important: `TranslationSession` is a non-Sendable class; it is constructed inside the Task closure to avoid Sendable warnings — do not hoist it.** Also contains `convertBuffer` and `VoError`. |
| `AudioSource.swift` | `MicCapture` (AVAudioEngine input node) and `SpeakerCapture` (Core Audio process tap: `CATapDescription` + `AudioHardwareCreateProcessTap`, mounted on a private aggregate device with an IOProc). Both expose `AsyncStream<AVAudioPCMBuffer>`. Includes the `AVAudioPCMBuffer.copy()` extension and `CoreAudioError`. |
| `Renderer.swift` | `StreamRenderer` actor + `RenderEvent` + `ChunkTiming`. Owns the strict-order commit queue, the volatile live region, the TTY rendering, the JSONL emission, the wall-clock timestamp formatting, and the wrap-aware screen-row accounting. |
| `Doctor.swift` | `runDoctor(json:)`. Gathers OS info, speech model status, translation language list, input device list via the helpers below, then renders human text or JSON. |
| `Locales.swift` | `collectSpeechLocales()` and `collectTranslationLanguages()`. Pure data collection, no I/O. |
| `Devices.swift` | `collectInputDevices()`. Direct Core Audio enumeration via `AudioObjectGetPropertyData`. |
| `Responsibility.swift` | `Responsibility.reexecAsResponsibleProcess()`. Bridges the private `responsibility_spawnattrs_setdisclaim` and re-execs vo so TCC grants attach to vo rather than the terminal. Called unconditionally from `Listen.swift`, but gated on `hasEmbeddedInfoPlist()` (release builds only) and best-effort: returns and continues in-process on any failure. |
| `SessionLog.swift` | Streaming JSONL transcript file. Two modes: explicit (`--transcript <path>` writes directly there) or temp (`TMPDIR` file moved/discarded on exit). Owns the overwrite-confirm and `Save transcript?` prompts. |

### Key invariants in `StreamRenderer`

1. **Strict source-order commit.** `commitQueue` is FIFO; pairs are emitted to scrollback only when the queue head has its translation filled in. A slow translation for chunk N blocks chunks N+1, N+2 from being committed even if their translations arrive earlier. This is intentional — the JSONL/TTY readers must never see out-of-order lines.
2. **Live region uses physical screen rows, not logical lines.** Long source text on a narrow terminal wraps, and a naive `\e[A`-based clear leaves ghost copies of the source line. `redrawLiveRegion` counts rows via `rowsNeeded(forLine:termWidth:)` which strips ANSI escapes and counts East Asian wide chars as 2 cells. **Never assume one `writeLine` = one screen row.**
3. **JSONL mode never writes the banner or summary** (`Listen.swift` checks `isTTY`). Anything other than valid JSONL going to STDOUT in `--json` mode is a bug.
4. **Volatile updates do not reach JSONL.** Only finalized chunks are emitted. The `RenderEvent.volatile` case is a no-op in JSONL mode.
5. **Timestamps are local timezone in both TTY and JSONL.** ISO8601 output uses `+09:00`-style offset, not `Z`. The TTY `HH:MM:SS` and JSONL ISO string represent the same wall-clock instant. `TZ=UTC vo …` flips both consistently.

### Channel-pair coupling

There is no global lock between the mic and speaker channels — they each construct their own `SpeechTranscriber`, `SpeechAnalyzer`, and `TranslationSession`. They share only:

- The `Renderer` actor (serializes all event handling).
- A `SeqCounter` actor (gives a monotonic `seq` across both channels so output order corresponds to which channel finalized first).

This is why the mic re-capturing speaker audio (acoustic feedback) appears as duplicate `[mic]` + `[spk]` events with similar content. `--voice-processing` is the only software mitigation we have; otherwise the user is expected to use headphones or `--no-mic`.

## Output formats

### TTY (default when STDOUT is a tty)

```
vo 0.1.0 — listening on mic + speaker (en-US → ja-JP)

08:34:56 [mic]  How are you doing?
                元気ですか？
08:34:58 [spk]  I'm fine, thanks.
                元気だよ、ありがとう。
                                                        ← live region below
         [mic]  … in-progress fragment                  ← volatile, redrawn in place
```

When only one channel is active (`--no-mic` or `--no-speaker`), the `[mic]` / `[spk]` label is suppressed and source text follows the timestamp directly with a three-space gap:

```
08:34:56   How are you doing?
           元気ですか？
```

Colors (256-color palette, Terminal.app safe). Both the timestamp and the channel label use the channel's tint, so the eye reads them as one unit:

- mic timestamp + `[mic]` label: 130 (amber)
- speaker timestamp + `[spk]` label: 24 (teal)
- Translation 244 (gray, sits behind source)
- In-progress volatile fragment text: 244 (same dim as translation, so it reads as "not committed yet")
- `(translating…)`, `(no translation)`, `… ` volatile leader: 240 (darker gray)

### JSONL (`--json` or non-TTY)

One JSON object per finalized chunk. `dst` is present only when `--dst` was supplied.

```jsonl
{"seq":0,"channel":"mic","timestamp":"2026-06-10T08:34:56.234+09:00","audio":{"start":0.124,"end":1.582},"src":{"lang":"en-US","text":"Hey, Tim.","confidence":{"mean":0.83,"min":0.62}},"dst":{"lang":"ja-JP","text":"ねえ、ティム。"}}
```

`audio.start` / `audio.end` come from `SpeechTranscriber.Result.range` (CMTimeRange) when valid. `seq` is monotonic across channels. `src.lang` echoes the BCP-47 form of `--src` (so `--src en` would give `"lang":"en"`, not `"en-US"`).

`src.confidence` carries the chunk's transcription confidence, aggregated from the per-run `transcriptionConfidence` attribute (requested unconditionally via `attributeOptions`). `mean` is weighted by run length and `min` is the worst run, both rounded to three decimals. It is **acoustic per-character confidence, not word correctness** (a fully wrong transcription can still score a high mean while its `min` dips), so `min` is the more actionable "re-listen here" signal. The whole `confidence` object is omitted only when no run carried a value. There is no confidence for `dst`. The Translation framework exposes no quality score, so `src.confidence` is the pipeline's only quality signal. Confidence never appears in TTY output, only JSONL/transcript.

## Distribution plan (not yet implemented)

- Ship as a bare Mach-O binary, **ad-hoc signed** (not Developer ID). `scripts/build.sh` embeds `Resources/Info.plist` into `__TEXT,__info_plist` via linker, then `codesign -s -` with `Resources/vo.entitlements`.
- Distribute via a personal Homebrew tap (`k1LoW/homebrew-tap`) as a Formula. Homebrew's `formula_installer.rb` has no quarantine code path, but macOS still applies `com.apple.quarantine` to the downloaded tarball at the network-stack / LaunchServices layer regardless of HTTP client, and `tar -x` carries the attribute over to the staged binary. The Formula's `install` step therefore runs `xattr -cr bin/"vo"` to strip it before Gatekeeper inspects the ad-hoc-signed binary. Users install with `brew install k1LoW/tap/vo`. The proper long-term fix is Developer ID signing + `notarytool`, which would remove the need for the strip; we defer that until vo's audience justifies the $99/year + CI work.
- `.app` bundle is **not** required for ad-hoc signing or for TCC; embedding Info.plist into the Mach-O is sufficient.

## Style notes

- All Swift comments are in English (per `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` global rule).
- Source comments explain "why" only — no narration of what the code does.
- Punctuation rule for prose: avoid em dash (`—`), and avoid `:` / `-` as sentence connectors. They are allowed inside code, YAML keys, URLs, and command flags.
