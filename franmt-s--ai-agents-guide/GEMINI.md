> [!IMPORTANT]
> Never add dense technical content to `src/es/ai-learning-guide.md`. That file only contains summary tables and links to specific tool files in `src/es/`. All detailed configurations go in the tool-specific file.

> [!WARNING]
> The `conductor/` and `spec/` folders are **personal working directories** excluded from version control via `.gitignore`. They exist only on the local machine for the owner's reference.
> - You MAY read them to understand context or intentions when explicitly asked.
> - You MUST NOT suggest committing, publishing, or referencing them in any documentation under `src/`.
> - Do NOT treat their content as project requirements unless the owner explicitly confirms so.

## 1. Language and Tone Rules

- **Spanish Prose:** All descriptive and narrative content directed at the end-user MUST be in Spanish.
- **English Technical Terms:** Code snippets, terminal commands, file names, configuration keys (JSON/YAML), and industry terms (e.g., *Hooks*, *Skills*, *Headless Mode*, *Subagents*) MUST remain in English.
- **Code Comments:** Comments inside any code block (including configuration examples) MUST be in English.
- **No Emojis:** Never use emojis in code comments or serious technical writing, unless they are specific visual indicators requested for tables (e.g., ✅, ⚠️, ❌).
- **Narrative Hooks for Titles:** Never use sterile, academic titles like "Reasoning Tokens". You MUST use narrative hooks that communicate a practical consequence, value, or danger (e.g., "Reasoning Tokens: Why Expensive Models Are Worth Every Penny").
- **Engaging Technical Explanations:** Avoid dry Wikipedia-style definitions. When explaining complex architectural concepts, always use relatable human analogies (e.g., "Imagine asking an engineer to design an architecture without a notepad..."). The text must be direct, conversational, and make the user feel they have something practical to lose or gain. Never sound like an academic paper.

---

## 2. Visual Format and Architecture

### Callouts (Obsidian Style)

Always use native Obsidian callouts to highlight information:

```markdown
> [!NOTE]
> For general notes or links to related files.

> [!TIP]
> For best practice advice (e.g., resetting OAuth, using symlinks).

> [!WARNING]
> For security risks (e.g., sandboxing, context pollution) or breaking behaviors.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For critical framework rules that must not be ignored.
```

### Tables

Use **Comparative Tables** to show differences between agents or models. Example:

| Tool           | Context File                   | Precedence Logic                              |
| :------------- | :----------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- |
| **Cursor**     | `.cursor/rules/*.mdc`          | Activation via `glob` patterns.               |
| **Gemini CLI** | `GEMINI.md`, `AGENTS.md`       | Recursive scan upward until `.git`.           |
| **Claude Code**| `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`       | Auto-imports files from `src/`.               |

### Role of the Main Guide vs. Tool Files

- `src/es/ai-learning-guide.md` → Only overview tables, concept explanations, and links to tool files.
- `src/es/<tool>.md` → All detailed config structures, directory trees, JSON examples, and sources.

---

## 3. Standards for Tool Technical Documentation

When modifying or creating any file in `src/es/` (e.g., `src/es/gemini-cli.md`, `src/es/claude-code.md`), **every concept section** (Context, Skills, MCP, Plugins, Hooks, Subagents, Automation) MUST follow this exact pattern:

### Pattern: Text → Directory Tree → Config Block → Source

**1. One paragraph** describing the concept and what makes this tool unique in that area.

**2. A `text` Directory Tree** showing exactly where the configuration file lives:

```text
my-project/
└── .gemini/
    └── settings.json
```

**3. A configuration block** in the correct format (`json`, `yaml`, `toml`, `bash`, or `markdown`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "local-db": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/server.js"],
      "excludeTools": ["drop_table"]
    }
  }
}
```

**4. An italic source line** with the official documentation link:

```markdown
*Source: [Gemini CLI: MCP Server Setup](https://geminicli.com/docs/tools/mcp-server/)*
```

---

### Complete Section Example (Hooks in a tool file)

The following is a well-formed section. Use it as the gold standard when writing or reviewing any concept in `src/`:

```markdown
## Hooks: How to Make Your Agent Run Scripts Without Being Asked

Imagine that every time your agent is about to modify a file, an invisible guard
runs your validation script and blocks the operation if something doesn't add up.
That's exactly what **Hooks** do: automatic triggers that respond to lifecycle
events in the agent, configured in `settings.json` and communicated
via `stdin`/`stdout` with strict JSON.

**Directory Structure:**
```text
my-project/
└── .gemini/
    └── settings.json
```

**Configuration Example (`settings.json`):**
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "BeforeTool": [
      {
        "command": "./scripts/validate-tool.sh"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Example Input received by the hook (`stdin`):**
```json
{
  "session_id": "string",
  "hook_event_name": "BeforeTool",
  "cwd": "/path/to/project",
  "timestamp": "2026-04-03T12:00:00Z"
}
```

```

## 4. File-to-Tool Mapping

Each tool has a dedicated file in `src/es/`. Never duplicate content across files. If a concept is shared (e.g., the AGENTS.md standard), document it in `src/es/ai-learning-guide.md` and link to it from the tool file.

| File                        | Covers                                                       |
| :-------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `src/es/tools/antigravity.md` | Antigravity (Gemini in VSCode): Rules, Workflows, Plugins    |
| `src/es/tools/claude-code.md` | Claude Code CLI: CLAUDE.md, Hooks, Sub-agents, Headless      |
| `src/es/tools/codex-cli.md`   | Codex CLI: AGENTS.md, `config.toml`, `--full-auto`           |
| `src/es/tools/cursor.md`      | Cursor IDE: `.mdc` rules, MCP Apps, Hooks, Subagents         |
| `src/es/tools/gemini-cli.md`  | Gemini CLI: GEMINI.md, Extensions, Hooks, Orchestrators      |
| `src/es/tools/opencode.md`    | OpenCode: `opencode.json`, Lazy Loading, `@file` refs        |
| `src/es/concepts/mcp.md`      | MCP architecture, best practices, and curated configs.       |
| `src/es/concepts/skills.md`   | Skills system (all tools): SKILL.md anatomy, templates       |

### Template Files

Templates live in `src/templates/agents/`. Secondary doc files (inside `docs/`) use **lowercase kebab-case**. Only root agent instructions (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`) use uppercase.

| Template                                          | Purpose                                                           |
| :------------------------------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `src/templates/agents/monolith/AGENTS.md`         | Single-file layout for small/medium projects                      |
| `src/templates/agents/progressive/AGENTS.md`      | Root file (minimal) for projects using Progressive Disclosure     |
| `src/templates/agents/progressive/packages/api/AGENTS.md` | Package-level AGENTS.md in a monorepo                         |
| `src/templates/agents/progressive/docs/typescript.md`  | TypeScript conventions (loaded on demand)                        |
| `src/templates/agents/progressive/docs/testing.md`     | Testing strategy and commands (loaded on demand)                  |
| `src/templates/agents/progressive/docs/components.md`  | React component structure and rules (loaded on demand)            |
| `src/templates/agents/progressive/docs/styles.md`      | CSS Modules, design tokens, dark mode (loaded on demand)          |
| `src/templates/agents/progressive/docs/architecture.md`| System architecture and directory tree (loaded on demand)         |
| `src/templates/agents/progressive/docs/tech-stack.md`  | Tech stack, versions, dependency policy (loaded on demand)        |

## 5. "Zero Hallucination" Policy

- **Source of Truth:** Only extract technical information, terminal flags, or architectures if they explicitly come from the tool's official documentation.
- **Do not invent:** Never assume behavior based on older versions of an agent. If you do not know a fact, state it and request the official documentation link.
- **Reference URLs:** At the end of each major concept or section, add the official source using this exact format:

```markdown
*Source: [Tool Name: Section Title](https://official.url/path)*
```

Multiple sources:
```markdown
*Sources: [Title One](https://url1) | [Title Two](https://url2)*
```
