Self-hosted platform for MCP Apps and agent automations, built on Bun. Agentic loop + MCP bundle management + interactive UI host + cron-scheduled automations + skill-driven prompt composition + HTTP API + web client.

## Build & Verify

```bash
bun install                # Install dependencies
bun run dev                # API (:27247) + Web (:27246) with watch/HMR
bun run dev:worktree       # Run from any worktree against an isolated workdir on alt ports — see "Worktree dev" below
bun run dev:api            # API only with auto-restart
bun run verify             # Full CI parity — runs every subscript below
bun run verify:static      # format:check + lint + check + check:cycles
bun run verify:test-unit   # test:unit + test:web + test:bundles

bun run test               # Unit then integration (stops at the first failing suite)
bun run test:unit          # Unit tests only (fast, ~10s)
bun run test:integration   # Integration tests only
bun run lint               # Biome linter
bun run format:check       # Biome format diff (no writes) — matches CI
bun run check              # TypeScript strict mode
bun run format             # Biome auto-format (writes)

cd web && bun install      # Web client dependencies (separate package.json)
cd web && bun run build    # Web production build → web/dist/

bun run install:bundles    # Bundle UI deps (each a separate package.json) — the exact command CI runs
bun run build:bundles      # Rebuild every src/bundles/*/ui (vite single-file)
```

**A fresh checkout/worktree must install `web/` AND every `src/bundles/*/ui/` before `bun run verify`.** `verify:test-unit` runs `test:web` + `test:bundles`, which execute those separate packages; root `bun install` doesn't cover them, so verify fails with a missing-module error (e.g. `Cannot find package 'dompurify'`) until they're installed. **But `test:unit` itself runs on root deps alone** — the backend unit suite imports the shared bridge protocol (`web/src/bridge/*`), so a web-only *value* import must never leak into that graph: keep such deps type-only and inject the value at the browser entry (`web/src/sentry.ts` is the pattern). The `Unit Tests (root deps only)` CI job enforces this; only `test:web`/`test:bundles` need the `web/` + bundle installs.

**A fresh checkout prepares itself.** `node_modules` and `dist/` are both gitignored, so a
new clone or worktree has neither. Every dev launcher — `dev`, `dev:empty`, `dev:minimal`,
`dev:docs-demo`, `dev:worktree` — installs `web/` dependencies and builds any bundle UI
missing its `dist/index.html` before starting, so the quickstart does not need those steps.
`dev:worktree` additionally installs **root** dependencies, which it must: `scripts/dev.ts`
imports from `src/`, so it cannot install the dependencies it needs in order to load. Only
what is absent is done — see the rebuild note below.

**`bun run dev` does NOT rebuild bundles.** The API serves each bundle from its pre-built `src/bundles/<name>/ui/dist/index.html`. After editing any file under `src/bundles/*/ui/src/`, run `bun run build:bundles` and restart the dev server (the API reads dist on iframe mount; it doesn't watch the file). Forgetting this means the iframe loads stale code while your changes look "live" in the source tree — a high-confusion failure mode.

**Before opening a PR, run `bun run verify`.** It is the single command that mirrors CI, enforced by construction: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` invokes only `verify:*` subscripts (plus `test:integration`) — no inline check steps. To add or change a check, edit the matching subscript in `package.json`; CI picks it up automatically. If CI ever catches something `verify` didn't, the fix is to update the subscript, not the checklist. Tool-level parity is the gate; discipline-level rules are not.

### Worktree dev

`bun run dev:worktree` runs the platform from any git worktree against a worktree-local workdir, on alt ports, with no auth gate — for QA on a feature branch without disturbing your primary `~/.nimblebrain` dev or another worktree's state.

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Workdir | `<worktree>/.nimblebrain-worktree/` (auto-seeded; gitignored) |
| Config | `<worktree>/.nimblebrain-worktree/nimblebrain.json` (auto-seeded on first run) |
| API / Web ports | 27271 / 27270 (override via `NB_API_PORT` / `NB_WEB_PORT`) |
| Auth | none (dev mode — no `instance.json`) |
| LLM keys | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (and friends) read from your shell environment |

Each worktree gets its own isolated state, so two worktrees can run side-by-side without colliding. Reset with `rm -rf .nimblebrain-worktree && bun run dev:worktree`. Share state across worktrees with `NB_WORK_DIR=/abs/path bun run dev:worktree`. Suitable for Chrome DevTools-driven E2E tests against `/v1/*` (no login dance).

## Conventions

- **Runtime:** Bun (not Node). Use `bun run`, `bun test`, `bunx`.
- **Module system:** ESM only. All imports use `.ts` extensions.
- **Linting:** Biome (not ESLint/Prettier). Run `bun run lint`.
- **Type checking:** `bunx tsc --noEmit`. Strict mode enabled.
- **Prefer typed-safe paths over `as unknown as T`.** When TS errors, find the input/output type matching runtime shape (e.g. stream-side vs prompt-side) before widening. Cast escape hatches require a comment naming the mismatch. Example: `src/model/inbound-fit.ts`.
- **Code-style rules beyond Biome/tsc live in [CODE_STYLE.md](./CODE_STYLE.md)** and are enforced by `bun run check:code-style` (part of `verify:static`). Add a rule when you find yourself enforcing the same pattern in review twice. Each rule lands with its check and the cleanup of existing violations in the same PR — otherwise it has no teeth.
- **HTTP framework:** Hono for routing and middleware. Typed context via `AppEnv`/`AuthEnv`.
- **Model types:** Use Vercel AI SDK V3 types (`LanguageModelV3`, `LanguageModelV3Message`, etc.) from `@ai-sdk/provider`. The engine calls `model.doStream()` directly.
- **No classes for data** — plain interfaces + factory functions preferred.
- **Tool results:** Return typed data in `structuredContent`, use `content` only for human-readable summary.
- **Errors:** Tool errors are caught per-call and returned as `isError: true` results. Engine errors surface via `run.error` event.
- **Documentation:** User- and operator-facing docs live in [`docs/`](./docs) (Astro + Starlight) and deploy to [docs.nimblebrain.ai](https://docs.nimblebrain.ai) via GitHub Pages. **Update them in the same PR as any user-facing change** (CLI, config, API, behavior) — co-locating docs with code is how we keep them from drifting. `docs/` is a standalone package: `cd docs && bun install`, then `bun run dev` / `bun run build` (or `bun run docs:dev` / `docs:build` from the root). The docs build runs an internal-link check and is a required CI gate on any docs change (`.github/workflows/docs-ci.yml`). `docs/` is excluded from `bun run verify` (biome/tsc are scoped to `src/` and `web/`). `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, and `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md` remain the standard top-level OSS files.
- **Per-directory agent docs:** any `AGENTS.md` is the real file; `CLAUDE.md` is a symlink to it (`ln -s AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md`). Edit `AGENTS.md`. New per-directory docs follow the same pattern. Don't invert it (real `CLAUDE.md` + symlinked `AGENTS.md`) — it confuses tools that prefer one or the other.
- **CHANGELOG entries must be terse and scannable.** Target ~250–350 words per release (not per entry). Structure: short `### Highlights` with 3–5 one-sentence bullets, then `### Breaking` / `### Added` / `### Changed` / `### Fixed` / `### Removed`. One line per bullet; link to docs or the PR for depth instead of explaining implementation inline. Include migration-required operator actions (e.g. "run `scripts/migrate-tenant-files.ts`") in Fixed/Breaking. Cut internal refactors, release-pipeline polish, CI tweaks, and per-PR credit noise — they belong in `git log`, not the CHANGELOG. If a bullet needs more than one sentence to explain *what* changed and *why a reader cares*, either (a) link out or (b) rethink whether the reader needs this entry at all.

## Testing

Tests use `createEchoModel()` from `test/helpers/echo-model.ts` and `StaticToolRouter` to avoid LLM calls. No mocking of LLM providers needed.

Tests are organized into three tiers:

| Tier | Directory | Command | What belongs here |
|------|-----------|---------|-------------------|
| Unit | `test/unit/` | `bun run test:unit` | Pure logic, mocked deps, no I/O or servers |
| Integration | `test/integration/` | `bun run test:integration` | `Runtime.start()`, HTTP servers, real crypto, subprocesses |
| Eval | `test/eval/` | `bun run eval` | LLM evals, require `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` |

**Every bun process in the test path passes `--no-env-file`.** Bun auto-loads
`.env`, so without it a developer's real `COMPOSIO_API_KEY` reaches the test
process — failing the tests that assert the unconfigured path, and letting test
code make live API calls. CI has no `.env`, so it stays green and the failure
looks local-only.

The flag binds to one process and does not propagate: a child re-runs the
auto-load itself. So it goes on the `test:*` scripts, on every `bun` a test
spawns (`cli.test.ts` boots the full runtime; the `scripts/check-*` suites spawn
the checkers), and on any single file you run by hand —
`bun test --no-env-file <file>`.

It disables dotenv, not the environment: a value exported in your shell outranks
`.env` and survives regardless. `test:web` and `test:bundles` run in their own
directories without the flag — neither reads a credential today.

A repo-wide `env = false` in `bunfig.toml` would make this deny-by-default and
delete every flag site. It also cuts `.env` from `bun run dev`, `start`, and
`eval` unless each carries `--env-file=.env`, which is a separate change with
its own blast radius — tracked in #839.

Shared test helpers live in `test/helpers/` (imported by both unit and integration).

**Classification rule:** If a test calls `Runtime.start()`, `startServer()`, `Bun.serve()`, or `spawnSync()`, it belongs in `test/integration/`. Everything else goes in `test/unit/`.

## Workspace Isolation

All tool handlers that access data must be workspace-scoped. Use `runtime.requireWorkspaceId()` (never `getCurrentWorkspaceId()`). In dev mode it returns `"_dev"` — no special-case logic needed.

**Workspace-scoped writes have no org-admin bypass, and the web tier must agree.** `canWriteWorkspaceScoped` (`src/workspace/authz.ts`) allows a write only for a workspace **member** whose membership role is `admin`; `orgRole` is never consulted. The web tier's `useScopedRole` deliberately does the opposite — it escalates an org admin to `org_admin` *before* reading the workspace role — because that is the right answer for **reach** (nav, route guards, read gates), where an org admin legitimately gets to any workspace's settings. So the two must not share a helper. Gate a **write** with `canWriteWorkspace(membershipRole)` (`web/src/hooks/useScopedRole.ts`) — via `useCanWriteActiveWorkspace()` on a surface scoped to the active workspace (anything under `/w/:slug`), or by passing that workspace's role directly when the surface addresses a workspace **by id** (`/org/workspaces/:slug`, where `activeWorkspace` is the viewer's last-focused workspace — usually their personal one, where they are always admin by store invariant, so the active-workspace form would answer `true` for everyone). Reserve `roleAtLeast(role, "ws_admin")` for reach. Getting this backwards offers controls the server refuses and surfaces as a 403 on save. It shipped in nine places before being caught, in three different shapes — `roleAtLeast(…, "ws_admin")`, the bypass written longhand as `isOrgAdmin || <membership check>`, and an affordance with no gate at all — so grepping for one shape never establishes that a surface is covered.

A workspace-scoped write **should** route through `canWriteWorkspaceScoped`, and a client gate that disagrees with it is a bug — but do not read that as an invariant you can lean on. **The helper is a convention, not a chokepoint.** Writes reach the store by other paths: some gate through wrappers that delegate to it (`isWorkspaceAdmin` in `src/tools/connector-tools.ts`), and `manage_workspaces update` patches `workspace.json`'s `bundles` behind an org-admin gate instead — not a hole, since an org admin can delete the workspace outright and no web caller sends `bundles`, but not the helper either.

So read the write path. Do not assume a call site is covered because the helper exists, and do not assume it is uncovered because the helper is absent.

**Workspace ids are opaque and name-independent.** A non-personal workspace's id is an opaque token (`ws_<16-hex>`, generated by `generateWorkspaceId()` in `src/workspace/workspace-store.ts`), assigned once at create time and never derived from the name. The name is a freely-editable field — renaming a workspace via `WorkspaceStore.update({ name })` does NOT change the id, the on-disk dir (`workspaces/<wsId>/`), or the URL (`/w/<wsId-without-ws_>`). The id is opaque *by contract*: never parse it for meaning, never reconstruct it from a name, and don't assert a specific value in tests — assert the shape (`/^ws_[0-9a-f]{16}$/`) or use the id returned from `create`. The opaque alphabet is a strict subset of `[a-z0-9_]` so it never collides with the `-` workspace/tool separator in `ws_<id>-<tool>`. **Personal workspaces are the one exception**: they stay deterministic at `ws_user_<userId>` (via `personalWorkspaceIdFor`) for O(1) lookup by bootstrap, credential paths, and the personal-workspace invariants. `WorkspaceStore.create(name)` produces an opaque id; `create(name, slug)` honors an explicit slug (`ws_<slug>`) — used only by personal-workspace provisioning and deliberate operator/test overrides.

When adding a new code path that touches workspace-scoped credentials or identity, match the existing precedent: **hard-error on missing `wsId`, don't silently default**. `startBundleSource`'s named-bundle branch throws; the URL-bundle branch does too (for OAuth-provider paths). A `?? "ws_default"` fallback would pool credentials across tenants.

**Credentials live with their owner — the workspace for shared connectors, the identity for personal ones.** Workspace-shared connector credentials are reachable at `{workDir}/workspaces/<wsId>/credentials/...`, constructed only through `WorkspaceContext` (via `runtime.getWorkspaceContext(wsId)`) or the primitives in `src/config/workspace-credentials.ts`. A **personal connector** (a user's own remote MCP connection, reachable across their workspaces) is instead **identity-owned**: its OAuth tokens live at `{workDir}/users/<userId>/credentials/mcp-oauth/<serverName>/` via the `WorkspaceOAuthProvider` `{type:"user"}` arm — outside any workspace, so leaving a workspace never orphans them. Ownership is **structural** (the credential's location), not a field: identity connectors do NOT set `oauthScope`. The legacy `oauthScope: "user"` on a **BundleRef** (the pre-Stage-2 member-scoped-in-a-workspace-registry model) stays deleted from the read path — the loader `src/bundles/lifecycle.ts::assertBundleRefIsPostStage2` throws `LegacyOAuthScopeError` on any disk record carrying it. The guard stays as a permanent floor; the one-shot migration that produced clean data is retired. Otherwise `users/<userId>/...` holds non-credential per-user data (`users/<userId>/skills/`, the personal-connector install record `users/<userId>/connectors.json`). Hand-building `join(workDir, "users", userId, "credentials", ...)` is a regression caught by `check:credential-paths` — **except** the sanctioned `users/<userId>/credentials/mcp-oauth/` path, which the lint allows and which is built only through the `{type:"user"}` `WorkspaceOAuthProvider` arm.

**Conversations are workspace-owned.** Every conversation lives at `workspaces/<wsId>/conversations/<ownerId>/<convId>.jsonl` and is authorized by ownership (`Conversation.ownerId === access.userId`).

- **The path is the binding.** `Conversation.workspaceId` is set at create (the workspace the chat is born in, at the first message) and never mutated — there is no mid-chat workspace switching — so the directory is authoritative and the field is a denormalised convenience. **Both** conversation walls key on the directory: `ConversationLocator` parses it from the path, and the `conversations__*` index takes it from the directory the scan descended through. Neither reads the line-1 field, so a record is in exactly the workspace it is stored under and there is no "unstamped" case to fold in.
- **The binding is the session's workspace for the whole turn.** On resume, `_chatInner` resolves its tools, skills, apps, file partition, and the `## Workspace` prompt block against the conversation's own workspace (`convWsId`, read from the path by `resolveChatStore`) — never the client's currently-focused `X-Workspace-Id`. A conversation answered while you're focused elsewhere stays sealed to its workspace (no cross-workspace tool/context leak); the focused workspace only decides where a **new** chat is born.
- **READ stays owner-gated; RESUME also requires current membership.** Reading an owned conversation (`findConversation`, the SSE event stream) consults ownership only — a removed member can still read their own authored conversation. But **resuming** binds the session's tools/skills/apps to `convWsId`, so it would hand the workspace's tools to someone offboarded from it: `chat()` and `startTurn()` both re-check membership of the conversation's workspace on resume and throw `ConversationWorkspaceAccessDeniedError` (→ `403`) for a non-member. This is a per-**resume** check (once per conversation load, at session establishment — exactly where the wall says the workspace must be membership-validated), NOT the per-call scan the wall forbids. Personal workspaces are sole-member by construction, so they never gate. Automations carry the same shape and gate per run; files do not gate on membership today.
- **There is no cross-workspace listing.** Not an internal primitive, not behind a flag. `listConversations` covers exactly one workspace, and the workspace is a required argument. The tenant-wide raw-file read that usage aggregation needs is `listAllConversationFiles` — a separate function returning paths with no owner filter and no summaries, so it can never be mistaken for a conversation view. Reading a conversation **by id** stays cross-workspace and owner-gated (deep links and the chat panel's workspace reconcile need it).

| Operation | Use | Never |
|---|---|---|
| Build a dir | `workspaceConversationsDir` (`src/conversation/paths.ts`) | flat `join(workDir, "conversations")` — `check:conversation-paths` catches it |
| Read one | `runtime.findConversation(convId, { userId })` | |
| List | `runtime.listConversations(workspaceId, options, access)` | any cross-workspace variant |
| Write | `runtime.workspaceConversationStore(wsId, ownerId)` | |
| Personal workspace id | `personalWorkspaceIdFor(userId)` (`src/workspace/workspace-store.ts`) | hand-built `"ws_user_" + userId` or the template-literal form — `check:personal-workspace-id` enforces |

Both read paths route through the process-wide `ConversationLocator`, which resolves `convId → { wsId, ownerId }` across workspaces. Deleting a workspace **archives** its subtree to `archived/<wsId>/` (archive-then-cascade), never a hard `rm`.

**Files are workspace-owned.** A file lives at `workspaces/<wsId>/files/<ownerId>/<fileId>_<name>` (per-owner registry + bytes + sidecars in that partition), so the directory is the boundary: cross-workspace reads fail by construction and `workspace delete` archives files with the rest of the workspace. `FileEntry.ownerId`/`workspaceId` are denormalised — the path is authoritative.

- **Build a store ONLY via `runtime.getWorkspaceFileStore(wsId, ownerId)`**, which constructs through `workspaceFilesDir` from `src/files/paths.ts`, the single sanctioned site. `check:file-paths` rejects the identity-scoped `getIdentityContext(...).getDataPath("files")`.
- **A `files://<id>` URI stays bare.** The workspace is NOT in the URI; it comes from the ambient request. `files__*` is an identity-door tool, so the workspace comes from `RequestContext.workspaceId` — the single workspace a request is bound to, set on every door:

  | Door | Workspace |
  |---|---|
  | chat | the conversation's own `convWsId`, so a resumed chat's files follow the conversation, not the client's focus |
  | automation run | provenance |
  | `/mcp` | the validated `X-Workspace-Id` |
  | REST | the validated header, else the caller's personal workspace |

  No workspace in scope ⇒ file storage denies (e.g. an external `/mcp` call with no header).
- **The browser serve endpoint is bare too** — `GET /v1/files/:id`, no workspace, no query. A browser `<img>` GET can't send `X-Workspace-Id`, so the workspace is resolved from the globally-unique id via the process-wide `FileLocator` (`src/files/locator.ts`, `runtime.getFileLocator()`), which searches ONLY the caller's own owner partitions. The owner partition is both the gate and the search scope — no client-supplied coordinate, and a request reaches only the caller's own bytes.
- **The locator's `fileId → wsId` memo is never the source of truth.** `getWorkspaceFileStore` keeps it current (remember on write, forget on delete), and a stale hit self-heals via a disk re-walk.
- **Reading a file SHARED by another owner** (future `visibility: shared`) is a separate, visibility-checked path — never a widening of this locator to other owners.

Files an automation run writes land in the run owner's partition here, referenced from the run result.

**Automations are workspace-owned.** An automation lives at `workspaces/<wsId>/automations/<ownerId>/<automationId>.json`, one file per automation. Construct paths ONLY via `src/bundles/automations/src/paths.ts` (`workspaceAutomationsDir` and friends); `check:automation-paths` rejects the identity-scoped `getIdentityContext(...).getDataPath("automations")` and hand-built `users/<id>/automations/` paths.

- **The workspace comes from `RequestContext.workspaceId`.** Like files, `automations__*` is an identity-door tool, so it reads the same single bound workspace every other kernel source does.
- **A scheduled run fires as its owner.** The scheduler scans `workspaces/*/automations/*/` and keys by `${wsId}/${ownerId}/${id}`. The run is an identity-bound session **walled to** the automation's provenance `workspaceId` — its tools plus the owner's identity tools, with NO cross-workspace reach.
- **Membership is re-checked per run.** It is stamped from the creator's trusted context at create, and `executeTask` then denies any run whose owner is no longer a member of the provenance workspace (`WorkspaceMembershipRevokedError`, thrown before any tool binding) — the automations analog of the conversation-resume gate. The scheduler classifies that denial as **skipped**, not failed: no `consecutiveErrors` bump, no auto-disable. So a removed owner's automation stops acting immediately and **self-heals** if they are re-added. Personal workspaces are sole-member, so they never gate.
- **A run produces a run result, not a conversation.** Each run leaves a deliverable (final output), an activity log, and refs to any files it wrote (in the workspace file store) under `…/automations/<ownerId>/runs/<automationId>/` — an append-only `index.jsonl` of `AutomationRun` summaries plus a per-run `<runId>.result.json`. `runtime.executeTask` returns a `runId` and the deliverable, and creates no conversation.

### Workspace tool namespacing — the wall

A chat or task session reaches **exactly one workspace** plus the caller's identity tools — never a cross-workspace union. That one workspace is the conversation's own (a chat, sealed at create and resolved from its path on resume) or the run's provenance workspace (a task) — **not** whatever the client is currently focused on. Reaching another workspace does not exist; it is **denied, not gated**. **A tool name's shape is its scope (two doors):**

- **Workspace tools** are bare `<source>__<tool>` — the per-workspace registries, including the platform `nb` source. The workspace is NOT in the name: it comes from the session's membership-validated `workspaceId`, so a caller cannot name another workspace at all. (`ws_<id>-<source>__<tool>` is the RETIRED form — neither emitted nor routed; a caller presenting one is rejected and told to re-list.)
- **Personal connectors** carry a reserved `my_` marker (`my_gmail__send`). With workspace names bare, a workspace `gmail` and the caller's own `gmail` would otherwise be one string and two sets of credentials — a collision install-time checks cannot close, since the guard sees only the *caller's* connectors, never another member's. The marker is stripped at the door, so policy, events, and placements all still key on `serverName`.
- **Identity tools** (kernel identity sources — `conversations`, `files`, `automations`; see `src/tools/identity-sources.ts`) are **bare** `<source>__<tool>`. They're owned by the user and live OUTSIDE any workspace, so they're NOT composed into workspace registries.

`crm__search` (resolved in whichever workspace the session is bound to), `conversations__search`, and `my_gmail__send` can all be invoked in the same conversation — the source segment alone decides which door each takes.

**The wall is enforced in `routeToolCall`.** A session carries one `workspaceId` (a chat's is its conversation's own workspace; a task's is its provenance workspace; a `/mcp` request's is its validated per-request header). A bare `<source>__<tool>` routes by its source segment: a kernel identity source or the `my_` marker goes through the identity door (authorized by ownership via the source's `canAccess`); anything else dispatches into the session's workspace. A bare name that resolves in that workspace IS the workspace source — the marker already separates it from a same-named personal connector at emission, so dispatch does not second-guess it. A bare name that resolves there is the workspace source; one that does not is `UnknownToolSource`, with no special case for a caller who happens to hold a same-named personal connector — `UnknownToolSource` also means "installed but transiently absent", and guessing between the two would steer a model onto the caller's own credentials during a workspace-source outage. A session with **no** workspace (e.g. `/mcp`, below) denies workspace sources with `WorkspaceToolUnavailable`. The `ws_<id>-` form is rejected outright, which is what makes a second workspace **unnameable** rather than merely unreachable. **There is no per-call membership scan** — the workspace was membership-validated when the session was established (`X-Workspace-Id` middleware for chat; `personalWorkspaceIdFor` is member-by-construction; automation provenance is stamped at create time).

The session's reachable set comes from `runtime.listToolsForWorkspace(wsId)` (that workspace's tools + identity tools, all bare; the caller's granted personal connectors carry the `my_` marker); the engine's router and `nb__search` both read it. `nb__search` discovers **only** that workspace — there is no cross-workspace search corpus.

**Skills are walled the same way.** Layer-3 skill selection (`selectRequestLayer3`) loads org-tier (`workDir/skills/`, org-wide), workspace-tier (the conversation's own `wsId` only), and user-tier (`users/<userId>/skills/`) skills — plus **bundle skills** (a connector/app's own `skill://<name>/usage` guidance, synthesized and tool-affinity-matched) from the **conversation's own workspace only**. A bundle installed in another workspace never injects its skill here. No skill crosses a workspace boundary. The **app-aware briefing** is walled the same way: `focusedApp` / `<app-guide>` / `<app-state>` resolve `appContext.serverName` only in the session's bound workspace (`convWsId`), never by scanning the identity's other workspaces — so the prompt never describes an app whose tools the wall would refuse to call.

- **Parse** only via `parseNamespacedToolName(s)` from `src/tools/namespace.ts` (a name with no `ws_<id>-` prefix is `scope: { kind: "identity" }`). `namespacedToolName(wsId, name)` still exists for the legacy form but nothing in `src/` or `web/` emits it — only test fixtures that must construct a cross-workspace call. `check:tool-namespace` enforces the parse site.
- **Web tier** mirrors the parser at `web/src/lib/namespaced-tool.ts` (regex from `web/src/_generated/workspace-id-pattern.ts`, emitted by `bun run codegen`; `check:codegen` catches drift).
- **Per-call routing** lives in `src/orchestrator/route.ts`. Errors: `UnknownNamespacedToolName` (which the retired `ws_<id>-` form now raises) / `WorkspaceToolUnavailable` / `UnknownToolSource` / `UnknownIdentitySource` (`WorkspaceAccessDenied` is the base class of the wall's denial). Both `POST /v1/chat` and `/mcp` map them to identical structured `data.reason` discriminators.
- `BundleRef.oauthScope: "user"` is **deleted from the type union**. Every install binds workspace explicitly via `wsId`; legacy disk records throw `LegacyOAuthScopeError` on load.
- **Dev-mode parity.** The wall works in dev mode (no auth gate); the dev identity flows through the orchestrator the same as a real one. `runtime.requireWorkspaceId()` returns `"_dev"` only when no workspace is in scope.

**`/mcp` is walled to a per-request workspace.** A `/mcp` session has no fixed workspace; each request names its focused workspace via the `X-Workspace-Id` header (the iframe bridge `web/src/bridge/bridge.ts` and the web shell both send it). `McpServerHost.handlePost` validates the caller's membership and threads the workspace through an `AsyncLocalStorage` (`mcpRequestWorkspace`) so the SDK handlers see it: `tools/list` returns that workspace's tools (bare) + identity tools, and `tools/call` cannot address any OTHER workspace at all: the only form that could name one is retired and rejected. **Resources are walled the same way** — `resources/list` enumerates only that one workspace's sources, and `resources/read` resolves the caller's identity resources (`files://` etc.) first, then that one workspace, never a sweep across every workspace the identity belongs to. A request with no (or a non-member) `X-Workspace-Id` is identity-only — any workspace-source call is refused (`WorkspaceToolUnavailable`), and no workspace resources are listed or readable. This keeps the synapse iframe bridge working (it sends its active workspace) while closing the cross-workspace hole: membership-validated, one workspace per request, never a union. Do NOT restore the old cross-workspace `/mcp` union — derive the workspace from the validated header, never from the tool name alone.

### Personal workspace invariants

Personal workspaces (`isPersonal === true`) are sole-owner-by-design. The store enforces four rules and throws `PersonalWorkspaceInvariantError` (`src/workspace/errors.ts`) on violation:

1. **Members locked** to `[{ userId: ownerUserId, role: "admin" }]`. `addMember` / `removeMember` / `updateMemberRole` and `update({ members })` all reject mutations on personal workspaces.
2. **`isPersonal` frozen** post-create (both directions).
3. **`ownerUserId` frozen** on personal workspaces.
4. **`ownerUserId` forbidden** on non-personal workspaces (the two fields travel together).

What stays freely mutable on a personal workspace: `bundles`, `name`, `about`, `customInstructions`. Those are workspace-content edits, not identity edits.

The HTTP layer maps `PersonalWorkspaceInvariantError` to `422 personal_workspace_invariant` with `{ workspaceId, reason }` details (same shape as `ConversationCorruptedError → 422`). The workspace-mgmt tool handlers encode the error into `structuredContent` so it survives the in-process MCP serialization boundary; `handleToolCall` decodes and emits the 422.

## Debug Logging

Hot-path diagnostics are gated behind namespace flags so they're available when you need them without editing source. Use for tracing across the runtime ↔ SSE ↔ browser ↔ iframe chain.

### Server (`NB_DEBUG` environment variable)

```bash
NB_DEBUG=*         bun run dev    # everything
NB_DEBUG=mcp       bun run dev    # MCP source lifecycle + dispatch
NB_DEBUG=sse,mcp   bun run dev    # SSE event flow + MCP
```

`NB_DEBUG` is read once at process start. Changing it mid-session (e.g. `export NB_DEBUG=...` in the running shell) has no effect — restart the process for the new namespaces to take hold.

Namespaces (`src/observability/log.ts`):

| Namespace | Emits | Answers |
|---|---|---|
| `mcp` | McpSource construction; per-call dispatch showing `taskSupport` / `path=task-augmented\|inline` / cached tool count | "Why is my tool going inline vs task-augmented?" "Is my tool cache populated?" |
| `sse` | Every `tool.progress` / `tool.done` entering the runtime sink wrap; every `data.changed` broadcast with client count | "Are progress events reaching the SSE layer?" "Are broadcasts happening, to how many clients?" |
| `auth` | Identity-provider verify rejections at debug volume (the routine, self-healing reasons `no_token` / `token_expired`). Anomalous reasons — `org_mismatch`, `bad_signature`, `jwks_unavailable`, etc. — log at `warn` and need no flag. | "Why is a user being 401'd / involuntarily logged out?" |

Add a namespace by calling `log.debug("ns", "message")` (from `src/observability/log.ts`). Keep this table and the `log.ts` doc comment in sync.

### Bundle subprocess stderr (default-on)

Lines a bundle writes to stderr — Python tracebacks, warnings, application logs — are surfaced verbatim and prefixed `[bundle:<sourceName>]`, dimmed. **No flag required.** This is the bundle author's deliberate diagnostic output, separate from NB's own `NB_DEBUG=mcp` tracing; hiding it costs hours when a bundle crashes. To quiet a chatty bundle, silence at the bundle level (logger config) or redirect at the shell (`bun run dev 2> >(grep -v '\[bundle:')`). The last 50 lines are also captured into the `source.crashed` event payload as `stderrTail`, so post-mortem consumers see the cause-of-death.

### Browser (`localStorage.nb_debug`)

```js
localStorage.setItem("nb_debug", "*")        // everything
localStorage.setItem("nb_debug", "sync")     // just the data.changed fan-out
localStorage.removeItem("nb_debug")          // off
```

Reload after setting. Namespaces (`web/src/lib/debug.ts`):

| Namespace | Emits | Answers |
|---|---|---|
| `sync` | Every SSE `data.changed` arrival; parent-side flush with buffer + iframe app names; each `postMessage` forward to a matching iframe | "Is the browser receiving broadcasts?" "Is the iframe I expect actually mounted with the right `data-app`?" |

Namespaces are shared convention between server and browser: `NB_DEBUG=sync` plus `localStorage.nb_debug=sync` together trace the entire data.changed flow.

## Observability (OTel tracing + structured logs)

Vendor-neutral OpenTelemetry lives in `src/observability/`. The runtime depends only on `@opentelemetry/*` and the W3C tracecontext + OTLP wire formats — **never** a branded observability library. The wire is the interface.

- **Spans:** wrap work with `withSpan(name, attrs, fn)` (active-context, nests automatically) — never call the OTel API directly from feature code. Today's spans: `agent.turn` (engine run), `llm.call` (model stream), `tool.dispatch` (MCP dispatch), and the outer HTTP span (Hono middleware, continues an inbound `traceparent`). Add `requestIdentityAttrs()` to span attrs to stamp the verified identity.
- **Propagation:** `injectTraceparent(headers)` on outbound calls that should extend the trace (service-token mint, authenticated remote-MCP fetch). No-op outside a span.
- **Logs:** use `log.*(msg, fields?)` from `src/observability/log.ts` — never raw `console.*` in operational code (it bypasses the JSON/identity/correlation enrichment). With `NB_LOG_FORMAT=json` (set by the chart) lines are structured JSON auto-enriched with `service`, `tenant_id`, `trace_id` (the active OTel trace id — the field the Grafana Loki→Tempo pivot keys on), and identity; pretty dev output is unchanged. `NB_LOG_LEVEL` (default `info`) is the severity floor for info/warn/error; secret-keyed `fields` (a bare `token`, the `*_token` compounds, `secret`/`password`/`api_key`/`authorization`/`cookie`/`credential`) are auto-redacted before write, while LLM usage fields (`inputTokens`/`tokenCount`/…) are preserved. `check:no-raw-console` enforces the logger usage (the console/debug EventSinks are exempt; a rare exception takes a `// lint-ok:console` marker).
- **Trust rule — what may be stamped:** `tenant_id` is a boot-time Resource attribute from `NB_TENANT_ID`, never a request header. `user_id` / `workspace_id` / `conversation_id` come from the verified request context. **Never** stamp the display name, email, secrets, prompts, tool args/results, or file contents.
- **Config:** `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` enables export (unset = nothing exported, ids still exist for log correlation — so local dev and OSS checkouts need no infra). `NB_SERVICE_NAME` overrides the service name.
- **OTel deps are exact-pinned to one release train** (stable `sdk-trace-*`/`resources` + the matching experimental exporter). Bump them together or export serialization breaks; the version-coherence test in `test/unit/observability.test.ts` guards it.

## Long-Running Tools (MCP Tasks)

Any MCP tool whose work exceeds the stock MCP request timeout (~60 s) must be written as a **task-augmented tool**. The engine implements the client side of the MCP draft 2025-11-25 `tasks` utility end-to-end; bundle authors only have to opt in.

### Authoring a long-running tool

Declare the tool with `execution.taskSupport` on its `tools/list` entry. FastMCP (Python) makes this one line:

```python
from fastmcp.server.tasks import TaskConfig

@mcp.tool(task=TaskConfig(mode="optional"))
async def start_research(query: str, ctx: Context) -> dict:
    run = app.create_entity("research_run", {...})
    try:
        # phased work; ctx.report_progress(...) on each phase
        # app.update_entity(...) on each phase for live UI
        return {"run_id": run["id"], "report": report}
    except asyncio.CancelledError:
        app.update_entity("research_run", run["id"], {"run_status": "cancelled", ...})
        raise
```

- `mode="optional"` lets the tool run inline or as a task (client decides). Use this.
- `mode="required"` rejects non-augmented calls with JSON-RPC `-32601` — only use if you're certain every client supports tasks.
- `mode="forbidden"` (the implicit default) never runs as a task. Use for fast tools.

### What the engine does automatically

1. On `initialize`, advertises `capabilities.tasks.{requests.tools.call, cancel, list}` so servers know the client supports the task flow. (`src/tools/mcp-source.ts`)
2. When calling a tool whose `execution.taskSupport` is `"optional"` or `"required"`, dispatches through the SDK's streaming API: `client.experimental.tasks.callToolStream(...)`. (`src/tools/mcp-source.ts::callToolAsTask`)
3. Consumes the response stream — `taskCreated` → `taskStatus`* → terminal `result | error` — and emits `tool.progress` events on every `taskStatus` so the chat UI renders live.
4. Run-scoped `AbortSignal` is threaded through `ToolRouter.execute(call, signal)` → `ToolSource.execute(..., signal)` → RequestOptions on the stream. An abort becomes `tasks/cancel` automatically via the SDK.
5. Inline tool calls (taskSupport omitted / forbidden) use the regular `client.callTool(...)` path and the same signal.
6. Crash-retry semantics: **inline calls** restart the subprocess and retry on transport error. **Task-augmented calls do not retry** — task state lives server-side; retrying would create a confusing duplicate. Surfacing the error lets the agent decide whether to initiate a new run.

The spec-compliant task flow does NOT use the 60 s MCP request timeout — `tools/call` returns in milliseconds with a `CreateTaskResult`, and the SDK handles polling internally.

Default TTL attached to outbound task-augmented requests is one hour (`DEFAULT_TASK_TTL_MS` in `src/tools/mcp-source.ts`). Servers may clamp it lower.

### Dual-channel contract (engine + entity)

The task channel is how the **agent** awaits the result. Apps that have UIs should also update a **persistent entity** on each phase transition (via the bundle's state store, typically Upjack). This gives the UI a live view that survives:
- The LLM losing interest mid-run
- The client disconnecting
- The agent process being bounced

Both channels are sources of truth for different consumers. They must be kept in lockstep by the worker:

```
ctx.report_progress(...)  ─► notifications/tasks/status  ─► engine ─► chat UI
app.update_entity(...)    ─► filesystem                   ─► Synapse UI (useDataSync)
```

### Startup reaper pattern

Long-running entities can get orphaned if the bundle subprocess dies mid-run. The canonical fix is a startup sweep that marks any entity stuck in `working` as `failed` with a clear reason. See `synapse-apps/synapse-research/src/mcp_research/server.py::_reap_orphaned_runs()` for the reference implementation.

### Reference bundle

`synapse-apps/synapse-research` is the first consumer of this pattern. Its `tests/test_spec_compliance.py` exercises every MUST from the spec against an in-process FastMCP client and is a good template for new task-aware bundles.

## Prompt Security

`sanitizeLineField()` and XML containment tags in `compose.ts` are prompt injection mitigations. Do not remove without reviewing `test/unit/prompt-injection.test.ts`. The `DELEGATE_PREAMBLE` in `delegate.ts` prevents task-as-system-prompt injection.

**Bundle trust is install-time, not per-prompt.** Do not add `trustScore >= N` gates on any path that injects bundle-authored content into the prompt (skills, app guides, app state, custom instructions). Once a bundle is active in the workspace its tools are already callable, so suppressing the workflow guidance that teaches the model how to use them safely makes the model less safe, not more — and tool descriptions, tool outputs, and `app://instructions` flow through ungated already. The defense is XML containment with `</tag>` escape in the body, the pattern used by `<app-state>`, `<app-guide>`, `<app-instructions>`, `<app-custom-instructions>`, and `<layer3-skill>`. Any new bundle-authored containment tag must escape its own closing form in the body the same way. `trustScore` fields on `FocusedAppInfo` / `AppStateInfo` / `PromptAppInfo` remain for display only.

## API Surfaces — Three Audiences

The platform serves three audiences with three protocol surfaces. They are not tiers; they are distinct contracts for distinct callers, intentionally split.

| Audience | Surface | When |
|---|---|---|
| External MCP clients (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor, any RFC-conformant client) | `POST /mcp` (Streamable HTTP MCP) | Any caller speaking the MCP protocol from outside the platform. Stateful: server allocates `Mcp-Session-Id` bound to workspace + identity. |
| Iframe widgets (synapse apps in sandboxed `<iframe>`s) | postMessage → `bridge.ts` → MCP SDK Client → `/mcp` | Sandboxed UI talking via the MCP App ext-apps protocol. The bridge is the only iframe path; it shares one `Mcp-Session-Id` per browser tab via a singleton client. |
| Platform's own web shell (first-party React UI: header, settings, chat) | `POST /v1/tools/call`, `POST /v1/resources/read`, `GET /v1/...` (REST) | Trusted same-origin code. Stateless per request: `X-Workspace-Id` header on each fetch; no session, no transport lifecycle. |

> **`/mcp` is walled to a per-request workspace.** A `/mcp` session has no fixed workspace; each request's validated `X-Workspace-Id` bounds it to one workspace (its tools + identity tools), and a call to any other workspace is denied. A request with no/non-member header is identity-only. The iframe bridge (row 2) sends its active workspace on every call, so synapse apps work. See "Workspace tool namespacing — the wall" above.

**Quick decision rules for contributors:**

- Adding a new feature to a settings tab, the chat composer, or anywhere in `web/src/` outside `web/src/bridge/` → use the REST helpers in `web/src/api/client.ts`. Do not import the MCP bridge client.
- Adding a feature to a synapse app (lives in `synapse-apps/<name>/ui/`) → use `@nimblebrain/synapse`'s `callTool` / `callToolAsTask` / `readResource`. The SDK speaks postMessage; the bridge handles the rest.
- Adding a new `nb__*` built-in tool → register it in the engine; both REST and `/mcp` audiences pick it up automatically. Don't add a special endpoint.

**Prefer tool actions over new REST routes.** When the web shell needs a new server-side capability (read installed connectors, save user_config, fetch the OAuth redirect URI, etc.), the default answer is a new **action on an existing platform tool** (e.g., `manage_connectors`, `manage_workspaces`) — not a new `/v1/...` Hono route. A tool action gets routing, auth gating, structured-error handling, and external MCP-client access for free. A new route reinvents all of that and adds surface area to maintain.

The exceptions are real but narrow: add a route only when the endpoint genuinely **can't be a tool call**. Concretely:

- Sets a session-bound cookie that future requests need to present (`/v1/mcp-auth/initiate` sets `nb_oauth_state`).
- Is itself the redirect target of an external flow (`/v1/mcp-auth/callback` is loaded by the vendor's browser, not by our client).
- Streams non-JSON bytes (multipart upload, SSE for the chat stream).
- Serves binary resources or HTML the browser navigates to directly (`/v1/apps/:name/resources/*`).

If none of those apply, write a tool action. A simple JSON read like "what's the OAuth redirect URI?" is a tool action, not a route.

**Why split**, not consolidate: the web shell and external MCP clients have different correctness requirements. The shell is trusted same-origin React with its own React lifecycle; making it speak MCP would force it into stateful session lifecycle (workspace-bound `Mcp-Session-Id`, reset on switch, etc.) for zero gain. Keeping it on stateless REST means workspace switching is a no-op on transport state — next fetch reads the new `X-Workspace-Id` and goes. The bridge needs MCP because external MCP clients also use `/mcp`, so iframes inherit a spec-aligned protocol surface for free.

`/v1/tools/call` and `/v1/resources/read` are NOT being deprecated. They are the platform's first-party API and stay alive indefinitely.

## MCP Session Architecture

Two-layer state model for `/mcp`. Don't merge them.

- **Transport map** (`McpServerHost.transports`): per-process LRU `Map<sessionId, TransportEntry>`. Owns the live `WebStandardStreamableHTTPServerTransport`, the SDK `Server` instance, in-flight JSON-RPC state, and `lastAccessedAt`. Process-bound — never serialize, never share across processes.
- **`SessionRegistry`** (`src/api/session-store/`): pluggable cluster-shared metadata. Stores `{sessionId, identityId, workspaceId, createdAt, lastAccessedAt}` only. **No pod / instance / owner fields** — adding any would leak deployment vocabulary into a metadata interface. Implementations: `InMemorySessionRegistry` (default) and `RedisSessionRegistry`.

Routing requests to the process owning a session's transport is the **load balancer's** job (ALB `lb_cookie` stickiness or header-hash on `Mcp-Session-Id`). The registry doesn't route; it can't move transports.

**Reclamation invariants** — see `mcp-server.ts` file header for the why:

- Idle TTL and LRU-on-capacity both go through `evict(sid, reason)`. **Delete from the map before calling `close()`**, never the reverse — concurrent-request race.
- Same TTL drives both layers (`Runtime.getSessionStoreTtlMs()` → host sweep + registry). One knob.
- Capacity overflow is never a 4xx. A well-formed initialize at `MAX_MCP_SESSIONS` evicts the LRU and is admitted. Do not reintroduce `Too many active sessions`.

**Session-miss `error.data.reason`** has exactly two values:

- `not_found` — registry has no entry (idle-TTL eviction or never created).
- `unavailable` — registry has an entry; this process doesn't have the transport. Don't try to distinguish process-restart from sticky-miss in the response — operators do that via deploy timing + `transport-count vs registry-size` divergence.

**Prerequisites for `platform.replicas > 1`** (all five required):

1. RWX storage or workspace data moved off the PVC. RWO PVC + `RollingUpdate` deadlocks on attach.
2. Routing keyed on `Mcp-Session-Id`. ALB `lb_cookie` stickiness on the platform target group, or NGINX/Envoy header-hash routing.
3. `sessionStore.type: "redis"`. Each tenant gets its own Redis instance in its own namespace (see `infra/CLAUDE.md` per-tenant Redis pattern). Default `nb:mcp:session:` keyPrefix is correct under that model.
4. `platform.strategy.type: RollingUpdate`. Only after (1).
5. `ConnectionRevalidator` gated to a single owner. The connection credential re-validation loop (`src/bundles/connection-revalidator.ts`) polls per-pod in-memory connection state; at `replicas > 1` every pod would poll the same provider account (N× the SaaS API calls against one shared key) and split-brain its flips (pod A flips to `reauth_required` and emits SSE on its own RunBus; pod B still shows `running`). It needs leader election (per-tenant Redis lease) so exactly one owner polls, and the same clustered RunBus as the limitation below to fan the flip out cross-pod. Until then it is single-owner-only — correct at `replicas: 1`, must be coordinated above it.

**Known limitation under `replicas > 1`: RunBus is single-process.** Chat turn replay/resume (the SSE-stream-backed viewer attaches to a per-conversation event log) lives in-memory on the pod that started the turn. A viewer landing on a different pod sees `isActive:false` for an in-flight turn elsewhere and the live frames don't fan out cross-pod. Sticky routing on `Mcp-Session-Id` (prereq #2) mitigates for the active tab; a pod restart or any cross-pod viewer (other tab/device) still drops resume mid-turn. The clustered Redis-backed RunBus is deferred work, tracked in `src/runtime/run-bus.ts` — `serve` warns at boot when `sessionStore.type === "redis"` so the gap is visible. `ConnectionRevalidator` (prereq #5) shares this constraint and the same deferred clustered-RunBus dependency: its `connection.state_changed` flips fan out only on the originating pod's RunBus today.

**Correctly per-pod (NOT a single-owner case): source self-heal.** `BundleLifecycleManager.tryRecoverSource` (hot-path re-registration of a workspace source that is installed but missing from the registry — torn down without a re-add, or never started because its endpoint was unreachable at boot; reached from the orchestrator's tool door and the three REST doors in `src/api/handlers.ts`) and its `recoveryAttempts` negative-cache cooldown are intentionally per-pod in-memory, and that is correct under `replicas > 1`. It guards a per-pod resource — `registriesByWs` is process-local and its sources are process-bound transports — so each pod must heal its own registry on its own miss. Unlike `ConnectionRevalidator`, it is reactive and idempotent (`hasSource` short-circuit, re-uses persisted OAuth state), touches no shared upstream account, and fans out to nobody, so it needs no leader election. Do NOT move the cooldown to Redis: a cluster-shared stamp would let one pod's failed heal suppress another pod's legitimate independent miss.

**Connection credential re-validation (`ConnectionRevalidator`).** A runtime-owned timer (sibling of `HealthMonitor`, started in `serve`) that detects connectors whose upstream authorization lapsed *without* a transport 401 — a brokered provider's downstream vendor account expiring while the platform→provider key stays valid. It polls each **registered provider's** probe through the generic `ConnectionHealthProbe` seam (`src/bundles/connection-probe.ts`; impls live per vendor under `src/connectors/providers/<vendor>/connection-probe.ts` — Composio and Smithery today) and flips `running → reauth_required` after N consecutive `credential_lost` verdicts (anti-flap; any API error/timeout is `indeterminate` = no-op; a flap-storm trips a circuit breaker that keeps all state). Dormant unless at least one provider contributes a probe, so a deployment with no brokered provider runs no sweep. Each provider owns its own kill switch — `connectors.providers.composio.monitorEnabled` and `connectors.providers.smithery.monitorEnabled` in `nimblebrain.json` (default on when that provider is configured) — while the sweep *cadence* is provider-agnostic: `NB_CONNECTION_REVALIDATE_INTERVAL_SECONDS` (default 300; the legacy `COMPOSIO_MONITOR_INTERVAL_SECONDS` is still honored but deprecated, warns once at startup, slated for removal #727). A probe reports only what the product can act on: Smithery's returns `indeterminate` for `auth_required`/`input_required` and logs the broker's setup URL, because a `ConnectionLiveness` verdict cannot carry a remedy link and flipping without one strands the user. Does NOT touch transports/restart/`dead` — that stays `HealthMonitor`'s job (liveness-of-process vs. liveness-of-credential, two disjoint loops).

**TTL units: seconds at the surface, ms internally.** Operator-facing: `MCP_SESSION_TTL_SECONDS` env (highest priority) > `sessionStore.ttlSeconds` config > 8h default. Conversion to ms happens in `Runtime.getSessionStoreTtlMs()` only — registry constructors and the host's idle sweep both take ms from there. Don't add mixed-unit code elsewhere.

## MCP App Bridge Rules

These cause production bugs if violated:

- `tools/call` must return `CallToolResult` as-is (never unwrap fields)
- `POST /v1/tools/call` must NOT emit `data.changed` SSE events (causes infinite loops)
- Picker uploads (`synapse/request-file`) MUST persist via `POST /v1/resources` (multipart); iframes receive a `FileEntry`, never bytes. Base64-in-`tools/call` arguments hits the 1 MB JSON cap and silently breaks for any binary above ~750 KB.
- Tool errors (`isError: true`) must become JSON-RPC `error` responses
- Bridge must guard listeners with `destroyed` flag (React StrictMode double-mounts)
- `SlotRenderer` effect depends only on `placementKey` (callbacks via refs, not deps)
- Shell components must not consume `ChatContext` (use `ChatConfigContext` instead)
- The chat panel is **workspace-scoped** — see below.
- `setAuthToken` in `web/src/api/client.ts` fires a registered lifecycle handler on real changes only (equality-guarded). The bridge MCP client registers `resetMcpBridgeClient` here at module load to drop its identity-bound session on logout. `setActiveWorkspaceId` is also equality-guarded but does NOT fire the handler — per Stage 2 / Q3 the `/mcp` session is identity-bound, so workspace switches reuse the same session and dispatch context via the per-request `X-Workspace-Id` header. Stateless callers (REST helpers) read the current values per-request and need no hook.

### The chat panel's workspace scope

`ChatProvider` (`web/src/context/ChatContext.tsx`) watches the **focus** workspace, derived from the `/w/:slug` route and membership-gated. Never from `WorkspaceContext`'s `activeWorkspace`, which starts on bootstrap's default and reconciles to the route a render later — keying focus off that intermediate value looks like a workspace switch and clears the conversation the per-tab restore just reopened. Reading `activeWorkspace` is fine for display-only consumers; it is the *focus* decision that must come from the route.

Re-scoping uses the narrow `newConversation()` (a fresh draft slice), **not** `chatStore.reset()` (that is the identity-change broad reset). A conversation belongs to one workspace, so the panel doesn't carry it into another. Two triggers:

1. **In-session switch.** `A→B` re-scopes and clears the open conversation. A `null` focus on home/identity routes is *held*, not reset, so `A→home→A` keeps context.
2. **Mount / async-focus reconcile.** After a refresh the panel restores the last conversation from per-tab storage with no transition to catch a workspace mismatch. Once the conversation's own workspace is known (`conversationMeta.workspaceId`, from `conversations__get`) it re-scopes if that differs from the focus. This fires only when the workspace is **known** — a not-yet-loaded conversation is left alone, which is the open-in-progress race guard.

Opening a conversation from within its own workspace doesn't change focus and matches, so it isn't cleared.

**The reconcile is the single guard.** `useChat` knows nothing about workspaces, so do not add a send-time backstop: by the time a send can run, the passive reconcile effect has already re-scoped the panel. The runtime still binds a resumed turn to the conversation's OWN workspace regardless of focus (the seal), so a mis-target is a wrong-conversation-selected bug, never a cross-workspace leak.

## Web Shell — Main-Area Views Beside the Docked Chat

`ShellLayout` renders left-nav | routed main area | docked chat (`ChatChrome`). Routed views under `/w/:slug/...` (e.g. `context/:convId`) render in the main-area slot **left of the chat** — their width is that chat-adjacent column, which shrinks as the chat docks or the window narrows. It is **not** the viewport width. How to lay that out (container queries, never viewport breakpoints) is in **`web/DESIGN.md`**, along with type, the opacity ramp, and the ambient-chrome default.

- **A routed element is reused across a param-only change.** The `/w/` prefix keeps `ChatChrome` mounted, so React Router keeps the same component instance alive when only the param changes (`context/:convId` A→B) — refs and state persist across the switch. On the param change you MUST (1) reset per-entity view state (selection/expansion and any `useRef` latch) and (2) cancel the previous entity's in-flight reads via an effect-cleanup flag. An unconditional `setState` in a stale `.then` lands entity A's data (its budget, its body) under entity B. See the load effect in `ContextInspectorPage.tsx`.

## Auto-Generated Files

Do not edit these manually:

- `bun.lock`, `web/bun.lock` — lock files, managed by `bun install`
- `web/dist/` — Vite build output, regenerated by `bun run build`
- `src/bundles/schemas/*.schema.json` — vendored MCPB JSON Schemas (v0.3, v0.4)
- `web/src/_generated/platform-schemas/` — TypeScript declarations derived from `src/tools/platform/schemas/`. Regenerate with `bun run codegen` after editing any source schema. CI verifies via `bun run check:codegen` (part of `verify:static`); drift is a build failure.

## Config Schema

`src/config/nimblebrain-config.schema.json` is the **canonical source** for the
`nimblebrain.json` config schema — edit it here. The runtime validates against it at
startup, and `.github/workflows/schema-deploy.yml` publishes it to
`schemas.nimblebrain.ai` (S3 + CloudFront invalidation) on push to `main` when it
changes. It must stay in lockstep with the runtime feature surface in
`src/config/features.ts`; `test/unit/config-schema-drift.test.ts` fails the build on
drift. (Previously this file was fetched from S3 at `postinstall`; that indirection
is removed — the repo is now upstream of the published artifact, not downstream.)

## Releasing

See [RELEASING.md](./RELEASING.md) for the prescriptive release runbook. When the user asks to cut a release, follow that document literally — it covers tagging conventions (semver with `v` prefix, hyphen = pre-release), the step-by-step procedure, the verification checklist, and rollback. Releases are cut by pushing an annotated git tag matching `v*`; `.github/workflows/release.yml` does the rest. Do not bump `package.json` per release.

## Full Architecture

See `README.md` for complete architecture documentation, API reference, configuration, deployment, and CLI details.
