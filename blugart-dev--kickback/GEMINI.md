## Architecture

### Design principles
- **Physics controllers emit signals, don't play animations.** Animation handling is the user's responsibility. Connect to `stagger_started`, `recovery_started`, `recovery_finished`, `hit_absorbed`, `balance_changed`, `fatigue_changed`, `recovery_interrupted`, `pain_changed`, `threat_anticipated`, `region_injured` signals.
- **Animation-agnostic.** The physics core reads `Skeleton3D.get_bone_pose()` — works with AnimationPlayer, AnimationTree, or custom animation systems.
- **All configuration via Resources.** `RagdollProfile` (skeleton mapping) and `RagdollTuning` (physics feel) are assignable on `KickbackCharacter`. Null = auto-detected Mixamo defaults.
- **Always-simulated rig.** Physics bodies never freeze. Springs are always active, driving bodies toward animation poses. Hit reactions reduce spring strength, letting physics take over temporarily.

### Active Ragdoll
- `PhysicsRigBuilder` creates 16 RigidBody3D + 15 Generic6DOFJoint3D
- `PhysicsRigSync` (a `SkeletonModifier3D`) writes physics transforms onto the skeleton each frame; the engine rolls the write back after skinning, so the spring's `get_bone_pose()` animation target stays clean
- `SpringResolver` drives physics bodies toward animation poses via velocity lerp
- `ActiveRagdollController` manages NORMAL → STAGGER/RAGDOLL → GETTING_UP → NORMAL state machine
- `STAGGER` state: springs reduced to floor strength, continuous sway force fights springs for visible wobble, Active Resistance dynamically adjusts per-bone strengths based on balance/CoM
- `PERSISTENT` state: stays ragdolled until `set_persistent(false)` is called

### Godot's built-in ragdoll (comparison demo only)
- `demo/partial_ragdoll_controller.gd` drives a `PhysicalBoneSimulator3D` for the
  side-by-side `demo.tscn` that contrasts Godot's built-in ragdoll against Kickback's
  active spring ragdoll. It is NOT part of the plugin — Kickback is the active ragdoll.

### Key technical decisions
- **RigidBody3D + Generic6DOFJoint3D** for active ragdoll (NOT PhysicalBone3D — see GODOT_CONSTRAINTS.md for why)
- **Velocity-based springs**, not torque PD controllers
- **Jolt physics required** — GodotPhysics cannot handle ragdoll joints
- **Animation stays active during ragdoll** — provides target poses for springs
- **Root motion stripping** — XZ position of root bone is zeroed by SpringResolver to prevent drift from Mixamo animations with root motion

## Conventions
- All scripts use `class_name` registration with `@icon()` annotations
- Controllers use `configure(profile, tuning)` pattern called by KickbackCharacter before `_ready()`
- Resources use `create_*_default()` factory methods for zero-config usage
- `SkeletonDetector.detect_humanoid_bones()` for auto-mapping any humanoid skeleton
- `KickbackRaycast.shoot_from_camera()` for one-line hit detection
- Collision: layer 4 (active ragdoll bodies); layer 5 (Godot built-in ragdoll, comparison demo only)
- Setup tool adds the active-ragdoll node set ("Add Kickback to Selected")

## character_root_path architecture
- `character_root_path` on KickbackCharacter and ActiveRagdollController must point to the gameplay root (the node that represents the character's world position)
- The setup tool defaults to `..` assuming Kickback nodes are direct children of the character root
- If Kickback nodes are inside a model sub-scene, override the path to reach the actual gameplay root (e.g., `../../MyCharacter`)
- Recovery teleports this node to the ragdoll landing position — pointing to the wrong node breaks character positioning

## CharacterBody3D integration

Kickback demos use Node3D roots. If your character uses CharacterBody3D:

- **Stop calling `move_and_slide()`** during RAGDOLL/GETTING_UP/PERSISTENT states — the physics rig drives position
- **Disable the CharacterBody3D collision shape** during reactions, re-enable after `recovery_finished`
- **Set `transfer_character_velocity = false`** in RagdollTuning if enemies walk toward threats (prevents ragdoll launching forward)
- **Use `get_active_state()`** to distinguish states for collision/movement logic:
  ```gdscript
  match kickback.get_active_state():
      ActiveRagdollController.State.RAGDOLL, \
      ActiveRagdollController.State.GETTING_UP, \
      ActiveRagdollController.State.PERSISTENT:
          return  # Ragdoll is driving — skip movement
  ```
- **Use `RagdollTuning.create_game_default()`** for amplified reactions suited to fast-paced games

## Locomotion with active ragdoll
- **All root movement and rotation MUST happen in `_physics_process`**, not `_process`. The spring resolver runs in `_physics_process` — modifying the root in `_process` causes spring targets to jump.
- Play animations once on state transitions, not every frame.

## What NOT to do
- Don't use PhysicalBone3D for the active ragdoll layer (root bone doesn't simulate in world space — see GODOT_CONSTRAINTS.md)
- Don't disable AnimationTree/AnimationPlayer during ragdoll (springs need target poses)
- Don't play animations directly from physics controllers (use signals)
- Don't move or rotate the character root in `_process` during active ragdoll — use `_physics_process`
