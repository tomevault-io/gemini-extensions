# AI Coding Assistant Guidelines

This document contains guidelines for AI coding assistants. It is structured with generic best practices that apply to all projects, followed by project-specific sections that should be populated when starting a new project.

## Generic Guidelines (All Projects)

### Project Management

#### Documentation Hierarchy

1. **CLAUDE.md is the source of truth** for all project specifications
2. README.md derives from CLAUDE.md with human-friendly summaries
3. In README.md, include: "For detailed specifications, see CLAUDE.md"
4. Update CLAUDE.md first, then sync README.md for major changes only
5. Keep CLAUDE.md in project root
6. **Use docs/ folder for topical documentation**:
   - Store technical docs, product requirements, and design specs
   - Use lowercase snake_case with date prefix (e.g., 20250517_color_system.md, 20250517_logging.md, 20250517_architecture.md)
   - **Required docs**: `docs/TODO.md` and `docs/20YYMMDD_product_requirements.md` must be created for all projects
   - Maintain an index of these documents in both CLAUDE.md and README.md
   - **AI INSTRUCTION**: Proactively create TODO.md and product_requirements.md if missing, then notify the user

#### TODO.md as Development Log

1. **IMPORTANT**: Maintain `docs/TODO.md` as central development log and task tracker
2. Include:
   - Current/upcoming tasks (with checkboxes)
   - Development decisions and rationale
   - Recurring issues and their solutions
   - Technical debt items
   - Code audit reminders
3. Update when: starting tasks, making progress, completing tasks, encountering issues
4. Check at start of each session

#### Session Start Checklist

1. Check `docs/TODO.md` for current state and development log
2. Run `git status` to see uncommitted changes
3. Run code tracking commands (see Maintenance section)
4. Review recent commits: `git log --oneline -5`
5. Check for outdated dependencies (if applicable)

#### Git Usage (Solo Developer)

1. Create git repo for each project with .gitignore
2. Work directly on main branch (no need for feature branches with multiple AI agents sharing same filesystem)
3. Conventional commit format: "type: Brief description" (fix, feat, docs, refactor, test, chore)
4. Before committing: run lint/build checks and verify functionality
5. Keep main branch stable and deployable
6. Commit regularly to track changes and enable rollback if needed

### Development Workflow

#### Planning and Implementation

1. Discuss approach and evaluate pros/cons before coding
2. Make small, testable incremental changes
3. Address code duplication proactively
4. When fixing issues, check for similar problems elsewhere
5. Document recurring issues in TODO.md

#### Code Quality Standards

1. Handle errors properly and validate inputs
2. Follow code conventions and established patterns
3. Never expose secrets/keys
4. Write self-documenting code with type safety
5. Remove debug output before production
6. **Documentation**: Be concise but accurate - avoid verbose explanations
   - Code comments only when necessary for complex logic
   - Documentation should be clear, direct, and to the point
   - Avoid redundant comments that merely describe what code already shows
   - Focus on "why" not "what" when documenting

#### Code Maintenance and Refactoring

1. **AI Tracking Instructions**:
   - Before each session: run `git diff --stat` to see recent changes
   - Track cumulative additions: `git log --numstat --pretty=format:'' | awk '{ add += $1 } END { print add }'`
   - When total additions exceed 500 lines since last audit, prompt user:
     "Added ~500+ lines since last code audit. Should we review for refactoring opportunities?"
   - Add to TODO.md: "Code audit pending (X lines added since DATE)"
2. Automatic refactoring triggers:
   - Duplicate code blocks (3+ occurrences)
   - Functions > 50 lines
   - Files > 300 lines
   - Multiple similar error handlers
3. During audits, check for:
   - Extractable shared utilities
   - Complex functions to split
   - Dead code to remove
   - Performance bottlenecks
4. Track findings in TODO.md under "Notes > Technical Debt"
5. Always refactor before major feature additions

### Debugging and Logging

1. **Use a proper logging framework** instead of console.log
2. Remove console.log statements before committing
3. Clean up debug output before production
4. Minimize linter suppressions
5. Use structured logging with appropriate log levels
6. For framework-specific logging tools, see the relevant section below

## Framework-Specific Guidelines

### Web/Frontend (If Applicable)

#### Technology Stack

1. Next.js for the framework
2. TypeScript for type safety
3. shadcn/ui for UI components
4. Tailwind CSS for styling
5. React for UI library

#### Component Patterns

1. Use server components by default
2. Add 'use client' only when necessary
3. Keep components focused on single responsibility
4. Extract complex logic to custom hooks
5. Follow container/presentational pattern where appropriate

#### State Management

1. React context for global state
2. Keep state local when possible
3. Use refs for non-rerender values
4. Optimize updates to prevent unnecessary rerenders

#### Theme and Color Management

1. **Core Principle**: Never hardcode colors in components
   ```jsx
   // 🟢 DO: Use semantic color classes
   <button className="bg-primary text-primary-foreground hover:bg-primary-600">
     Click me
   </button>
   
   // 🔴 DON'T: Use hardcoded values
   <button className="bg-[#1A202C] text-white hover:bg-[#171E29]">
     Click me
   </button>
   ```

2. Define colors in `tailwind.config.ts`:
   ```js
   colors: {
     primary: {
       DEFAULT: "#1A202C",
       50: "rgba(26, 32, 44, 0.05)",
       100: "rgba(26, 32, 44, 0.1)",
       200: "#2D3748",
       // ... more shades
       foreground: "#F7FAFC",
     },
     secondary: {
       DEFAULT: "#F7FAFC",
       foreground: "#1A202C",
     },
     // Semantic colors
     destructive: {
       DEFAULT: "#E53E3E",
       foreground: "#FFFFFF",
     },
     muted: {
       DEFAULT: "#F7FAFC",
       foreground: "#718096",
     },
   }
   ```

3. Use CSS variables connected to Tailwind:
   ```css
   /* globals.css */
   :root {
     --primary: theme('colors.primary.DEFAULT');
     --primary-foreground: theme('colors.primary.foreground');
     --secondary: theme('colors.secondary.DEFAULT');
     --secondary-foreground: theme('colors.secondary.foreground');
     /* ... other colors */
   }
   
   .dark {
     --primary: theme('colors.primary.900');
     --secondary: theme('colors.secondary.800');
     /* ... dark mode overrides */
   }
   ```

4. Color palette structure:
   - **Primary**: Main brand color with 50-950 scale for variations
   - **Secondary**: Complementary color for less emphasis
   - **Semantic**: destructive (errors), muted (disabled), accent (highlights)
   - Each color includes a `foreground` variant for text contrast

5. Usage guidelines:
   - Use Tailwind utility classes: `bg-primary`, `text-primary-foreground`
   - For opacity: use Tailwind modifiers like `bg-primary/10`
   - Custom CSS should use variables: `background: var(--primary)`
   - Create hover states with darker shades: `hover:bg-primary-600`

6. Theme switching implementation:
   - Store preference: `localStorage.setItem('theme', 'dark')`
   - Apply class to `<html>`: `document.documentElement.classList.add('dark')`
   - Use system preference as default fallback
   - Prevent FOUC with inline script in `<head>`

7. Documentation:
   - Maintain a COLOR_SYSTEM.md doc with visual palette
   - Include usage examples and anti-patterns
   - Document all color variables and their intended use

#### Logging with Pino

1. **Use Pino for web applications**:
   ```js
   import pino from 'pino';
   const logger = pino({ level: process.env.LOG_LEVEL || 'info' });
   logger.info({ userId: user.id }, 'User logged in');
   ```
2. Configure environment-specific logging:
   - Development: Pretty print with pino-pretty
   - Production: JSON format for log aggregators
   - Use structured logging with context objects
3. Log levels guidelines:
   - `trace`: Detailed flow for debugging
   - `debug`: State changes and debugging info
   - `info`: Important application events
   - `warn`: Recoverable issues
   - `error`: Failures with full context
4. Example patterns:
   ```js
   // Good: Structured logging with context
   logger.info({ orderId, userId, amount }, 'Order placed');
   
   // Bad: String concatenation
   console.log('Order ' + orderId + ' placed by ' + userId);
   ```

#### Performance Practices

1. Remove console.log in production
2. Debounce/throttle UI events
3. Minimize API calls
4. Lazy load components when appropriate

### Mobile Development (If Applicable)

#### iOS Development

1. SwiftUI for modern UI development
2. UIKit for legacy or specific requirements
3. Follow MVC/MVVM patterns
4. Use Swift Package Manager for dependencies
5. Handle deep linking and universal links

#### Android Development [TO BE DEFINED]

<!-- Add Android-specific guidelines when needed -->

### Backend Services

#### Supabase Operations (If Using)

1. Type all database operations
2. Use transactions for multi-table operations
3. Handle errors with proper rollback
4. Follow naming conventions (snake_case for tables/columns)
5. Use declarative schema workflow: https://supabase.com/docs/guides/local-development/declarative-database-schemas
6. **Database Migration Workflow**:
   - Stop the database: `supabase stop`
   - Make schema changes (edit SQL files or use Studio)
   - Start and apply migrations: `supabase start && supabase migration up`
   - Push to production (assuming project linked): `supabase db push`
7. Use Row Level Security (RLS) policies
8. Optimize queries with indexes
9. Handle real-time subscriptions carefully

#### Authentication & Security

1. Use Supabase Auth for user management
2. Implement proper session handling
3. Secure API endpoints with authentication
4. Never expose service keys to client

#### Payment Processing (If Using Stripe)

1. Server-side payment intent creation
2. Webhook handling for payment events
3. Secure API key management
4. Test with Stripe test mode first
