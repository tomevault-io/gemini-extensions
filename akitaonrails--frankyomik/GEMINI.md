# Frank Yomik

This repo has two moving parts:

- `server/`: Go API plus Python workers for manga and webtoon processing
- `client/`: Flutter reader app that wraps Kindle and Naver Webtoon in a WebView

If you need to get oriented fast, start with `server/main.go`, `server/handlers.go`, `server/worker/consumer.py`, and `client/lib/screens/reader_screen.dart`.

## What the system does

The API accepts page images, hashes them, deduplicates them, and queues jobs in Redis. Python workers pull from Redis, run OCR and translation, render a new image, cache the result on disk, and publish completion events. The Flutter client watches those events and overlays translated images back into the reader.

There are three pipelines:

- `manga_translate`: Japanese manga page -> English render
- `manga_furigana`: Japanese manga page -> furigana annotations
- `webtoon`: Korean webtoon page -> English render

## Repo map

- `client/lib/webview/strategies/kindle_strategy.dart`: Kindle page detection and capture
- `client/lib/webview/strategies/naver_webtoon_strategy.dart`: Naver detection and capture

## Runtime flow

### Kindle / manga flow

1. Flutter loads `read.amazon.co.jp` in a WebView.
2. `KindleStrategy` injects JS that watches the visible blob-backed page image.
3. On page detection, `ReaderScreen` captures the visible page.
4. The client submits the PNG to `POST /api/v1/jobs`.
5. Go stores the source image in Redis and the disk object store, then enqueues the job.
6. The worker processes the page with the manga pipeline and writes the rendered image plus metadata to cache v2.
7. The worker stores transient job status in Redis and publishes a websocket notification.
8. The client downloads the result and overlays it on the reader.

### Webtoon flow

1. Flutter loads `comic.naver.com` in a WebView.
2. `NaverWebtoonStrategy` discovers page images and reports them back to Dart.
3. The client captures each image through JS `fetch()` first, then falls back to an app-side HTTP fetch if needed.
4. The worker runs the webtoon pipeline and returns the translated image.

## Cache model

The server and worker share the same cache layout.

- Objects live at `cache/v2/objects/<aa>/<bb>/<sha256>`.
- Page manifests live at `cache/v2/pages/by-hash/<pipeline>/<source_hash>/manifest.json`.
- Optional metadata refs live at `cache/v2/pages/by-ref/<pipeline>/<title_slug>/<chapter>/<page>.json`.

The manifest is the source of truth. Redis is short-lived delivery state, not durable storage.

## API surface

Main endpoints:

- `POST /api/v1/jobs`
- `GET /api/v1/jobs/:id`
- `GET /api/v1/jobs/:id/image`
- `DELETE /api/v1/jobs/:id`
- `GET /api/v1/cache/...`
- `PATCH /api/v1/cache/by-hash/:pipeline/:source_hash/meta`
- `GET /api/v1/health`
- `GET /api/v1/ws`

Everything except `/api/v1/health` is bearer-token protected.

## Local dev

### Server

```bash
redis-server
cd server && AUTH_TOKEN=secret go run .
cd server && python -m worker --pipeline both
```

### Client

```bash
cd client
flutter pub get
flutter run -d linux
```

### Useful tests

```bash
cd server && go test ./...
cd server && pytest tests/unit/test_page_cache.py
cd client && flutter test
```

## Configuration that matters

- `AUTH_TOKEN`: required by the API
- `REDIS_URL`: Redis connection for the API
- `CACHE_DIR`: shared disk cache path for the API
- `server/config.yaml`: worker-side config for Ollama, OCR, fonts, cache, and webtoon settings
- `docker-compose.yml`: the normal multi-service deployment path

## Practical trust boundaries

These are the places worth treating as hostile input:

- image uploads to `POST /api/v1/jobs`
- metadata fields like `title`, `chapter`, and `page_number`
- websocket clients and job subscription lists
- web pages loaded inside the app WebView
- fallback image URLs surfaced by page JS in the client
- anything persisted under `cache/`

This is a token-gated bot, not a public consumer web app, so the security bar is different. The realistic threats are compromised tokens, malicious pages opened in the app, LAN sniffing when using plain HTTP, and cache/path abuse from authenticated clients.

## Security notes from this pass

Two issues were important enough to harden immediately:

- Cache path components were not consistently sanitized. `title` was slugified, but `chapter` and `page` could still flow into filesystem paths. The server and worker now reject unsafe path components instead of writing them.
- Site matching in the client used a regex over the full URL string. That meant a page like `https://evil.example/?next=read.amazon.co.jp` could activate a strategy. Matching now uses the parsed host, and the webtoon fallback fetch is limited to expected Naver image hosts.

Risks that still matter operationally:

- The websocket client still sends the auth token in a query string. That is convenient, but it can leak into proxy or tunnel logs.
- The Android app allows cleartext HTTP to local addresses. Fine for a trusted home LAN, not fine for untrusted Wi-Fi.
- The client stores the auth token in shared preferences. That is normal for this kind of side-loaded utility app, but it is not hardened secret storage.

## Versioning

Android `versionCode` is derived automatically from `git rev-list --count HEAD` in `client/android/app/build.gradle.kts`. This means every commit produces a higher build number — no manual bumping and no risk of version code regression (which causes "app not installed" errors on Android).

- **To release**: only bump the `version: X.Y.Z+1` display version in `client/pubspec.yaml`. The `+N` part is ignored for Android builds (git count is used instead) but kept for other platforms.
- **CI**: the release workflow uses `fetch-depth: 0` so the full git history is available for the commit count.
- **Fallback**: if git is unavailable (e.g. extracted tarball), the pubspec `+N` value is used.

Do NOT manually set `versionCode` in `build.gradle.kts` or rely on the `+N` in `pubspec.yaml` for Android.

## Where to look when something breaks

- job stuck at `queued`: `server/queue.go` (dedup returning stale job IDs), `server/handlers.go` (stale dedup re-enqueue), Redis Streams, worker logs
- result missing but worker finished: `server/results.go`, `server/worker/consumer.py`
- overlay wrong or stale: `client/lib/screens/reader_screen.dart`, `client/lib/webview/overlay_controller.dart`
- cache mismatch or rerender weirdness: `server/cache.go`, `server/worker/page_cache.py`, metadata patch route in `server/handlers.go`
- Kindle detection drift: `client/lib/webview/strategies/kindle_strategy.dart`
- Webtoon batching issues: `client/lib/screens/reader_screen.dart`, `client/lib/webview/strategies/naver_webtoon_strategy.dart`
- cache image 404 on download: `server/handlers.go` logs `WARN: cache image 404` with pipeline and hash; client retries with `force=true` via `jobs_provider.dart`

## Job reliability

Several layers protect against jobs getting stuck on high-latency or unreliable connections:

- **HTTP timeouts**: `api_service.dart` — 30s submit, 10s status poll, 45s image download.
- **Retry with backoff**: `jobs_provider.dart` — `_withRetry()` retries retryable errors up to 3 times with exponential backoff.
- **Stale dedup re-enqueue**: `handlers.go` — if dedup returns a job ID whose result expired from Redis (>60s old, no result), the server re-enqueues with `force=true`.
- **PEL claiming**: `consumer.py` — `XAUTOCLAIM` recovers orphaned Redis Stream entries from crashed workers every 30s.
- **Stale job timeout**: `page_job.dart` / `jobs_provider.dart` — jobs active >5 min are marked failed so the UI spinner stops.
- **Cache download fallback**: `jobs_provider.dart` — if a `cached-v2-*` image download fails (404), the client resubmits with `force=true` instead of failing permanently.
- **Targeted blob capture**: `kindle_strategy.dart` — captures the specific blob URL from the detection event, not whatever is currently visible (fixes wrong-page captures during rapid flipping).

## Editing guidance

If you change cache paths, update both implementations:

- Go: `server/cache.go`
- Python: `server/worker/page_cache.py`

If you change the job payload or metadata shape, check all three spots:

- `server/handlers.go`
- `server/worker/consumer.py`
- `client/lib/providers/jobs_provider.dart`

If you change WebView capture behavior, test both:

- Kindle single-page and spread-page capture
- Naver Webtoon lazy-loaded pages and batch prefetch
