## Mission

This repository is a curated **Awesome-UMI** list for the ecosystem around **Universal Manipulation Interface (UMI)**.

The goal is not to be a generic robot-manipulation bibliography. The goal is to organize the most relevant resources for:
- UMI core papers and official resources
- UMI-style methods for robot-free teaching, teleoperation, and cross-embodiment transfer
- UMI-related datasets and dataset families
- policies trained on UMI data or commonly used as UMI-relevant baselines / support models
- structured taxonomy knowledge such as embodiments, modalities, data formats, deployment constraints, and surveys

## Single-file content policy

All curated content lives in `README.md`.

Do **not** create `contents/` pages for paper organization.
Do **not** split the awesome list into multiple markdown content files unless the user explicitly requests it.

Allowed root-level files:
- `README.md` — the canonical awesome list
- `AGENTS.md` — governance and maintenance rules
- `LICENSE`
- optional static assets under `assets/` or `imgs/` when they improve presentation

## Canonical section layout

`README.md` should use this top-level structure:
1. `UMI Core`
2. `UMI Method`
3. `UMI Dataset`
4. `UMI Policy`
5. `UMI Taxonomy`

Use a Table of Contents near the top of the README and keep subsection anchors stable.

## Section definitions

### UMI Core
Include only the foundational layer:
- the original UMI paper
- official project / code / dataset community site
- direct follow-up papers that define the UMI ecosystem
- clearly UMI-centered survey / positioning papers

### UMI Method
Include methods strongly relevant to UMI-style collection, transfer, and deployment.
Typical subsections include:
- Human Demonstration Interfaces
- Teleoperation / Robot-Free Teaching
- Cross-Embodiment Transfer
- Bimanual Manipulation
- Dexterous Hand / DexHand
- Multimodal / Force / Tactile Extensions
- In-the-Wild / Egocentric / Mobile Extensions

Do **not** expand this section into a general manipulation-method survey.

### UMI Dataset
Include all relevant datasets for the UMI ecosystem.
This includes:
- official UMI datasets
- direct UMI-native dataset families from the community site
- strongly related dexterous / bimanual / multimodal / mobile dataset families
- method papers that also release a dataset

### UMI Policy
Include policies that are:
- trained on UMI data,
- evaluated on UMI-like datasets/tasks,
- or commonly used as relevant policy baselines / support models for the ecosystem.

Typical subsections:
- Imitation Learning
- Diffusion / ACT-style Policies
- VLA
- Cross-Embodiment Policies
- Bimanual Policies
- Dexterous Policies
- Deployment / Real-World Transfer

Do **not** include every famous robot policy by default.

### UMI Taxonomy
This is the structured-knowledge section.
It may contain papers, websites, docs, conventions, or notes.
Typical subsections:
- Embodiments
- Observation Modalities
- Action Spaces
- Data Formats / Storage Conventions
- Deployment / System Constraints
- Benchmarks / Evaluation Dimensions
- Survey Mentions / Taxonomic Discussions
- Best Practices / Standards / Notes

## Inclusion policy

The repository uses **core + strong adjacent** scope.

### Include first
- direct UMI papers and official resources
- projects and datasets listed on `https://umi-data.github.io/`
- direct descendants and strong neighboring work around robot-free teaching, teleoperation, cross-embodiment transfer, dexterous UMI, multimodal UMI, and UMI-style deployment

### Include selectively
- policy papers such as ACT, Diffusion Policy, or VLA systems when they are clearly used by or relevant to UMI-style training and evaluation
- survey / taxonomy papers that explicitly help explain the UMI ecosystem

### Usually exclude
- generic manipulation papers with weak or no UMI connection
- broad teleoperation or imitation-learning papers that do not materially help understand or use UMI
- unrelated robot planning, control, or benchmark papers

## Source priority

When adding or updating entries, use sources in this order:
1. official UMI paper / official project / official code
2. `https://umi-data.github.io/`
3. Google Scholar citation graph around the UMI paper
4. official project pages and GitHub repos for descendants
5. arXiv / conference pages for canonical paper metadata

If multiple sources disagree, prefer the most official public source.

## Verification rule for new entries

Do **not** add an entry unless it has a sufficiently reliable canonical public source.

Minimum bar for inclusion:
- a canonical paper URL such as arXiv / conference page / journal page,
- and/or an official project page, dataset page, or GitHub repo from the authors / lab / organization

If a candidate cannot be verified with enough confidence:
- do **not** add it to `README.md`
- do **not** guess missing metadata, URLs, venues, or affiliations
- do **not** include partially confirmed or rumor-like items just because they seem relevant

When in doubt, exclude first and wait for a reliable source.

## Entry format

Each subsection should use the same compact table schema:

| Date | Keywords | Institute (first) | Paper | Publication | Others |
| :--: | :------: | :---------------: | :--- | :---------: | :----: |

### Column rules
- `Date`: use `YYYY-MM-DD` whenever possible
- `Keywords`: short tags only; keep them scannable
- `Institute (first)`: first institution / lab only, concise and normalized
- `Paper`: title linked to the canonical paper URL
- `Publication`: venue name such as `RSS 2024`, `arXiv`, `ICLR 2026`
- `Others`: compact links such as `github`, `project`, `dataset`, `page`, `survey`

## Sorting rules

- Sort every subsection by `Date` descending.
- Newer entries must appear above older ones.
- If only month or year is public, infer the best consistent date from the canonical public release page and keep formatting stable.

## Overlap policy

Controlled duplication is allowed.

Examples:
- a method paper with a released dataset may appear in both `UMI Method` and `UMI Dataset`
- a policy paper that also defines evaluation taxonomy may appear in both `UMI Policy` and `UMI Taxonomy`

When duplicating an entry:
- keep the metadata consistent across placements
- adjust `Keywords` only if needed to explain the local role
- do not create unnecessary variant titles

## Dataset metadata guidance

For dataset-family entries, preserve as much of the following as possible in keywords or notes linked from `Others`:
- observations: Image, Proprio, Audio, Tactile, Force/Torque, Image x2
- action / embodiment: 6 DoF End Effector, Parallel Gripper, Bimanual, Dexterous Hand
- format / access: Zarr, HDF5, MP4, LeRobot, Raw Data, HuggingFace, Google Drive, Box
- scale: `# demos`, `# envs`

Use compact summaries in the table itself and keep verbose explanation out of the main row.

## Maintenance workflow

When adding entries:
1. decide the primary section first
2. check whether the resource should also appear in a second section
3. normalize the six metadata columns
4. insert in descending date order
5. update the Table of Contents only if headings changed
6. keep the README readable; do not over-tag

When reorganizing:
- prefer adding or refining subsections over inventing many new top-level sections
- keep the user-approved top-level section names unchanged unless explicitly asked

## Commit conventions

Use Conventional Commits.

Recommended types for this repository:
- `docs:` content additions or edits in `README.md` / `AGENTS.md`
- `feat:` meaningful new section or structural capability in the awesome list
- `refactor:` taxonomy reorganization without changing the underlying factual content
- `fix:` broken links, date corrections, venue fixes, naming fixes, anchor fixes
- `chore:` maintenance-only cleanup

Recommended examples:
- `docs(agents): define awesome-umi governance and sourcing rules`
- `docs(readme): add umi dataset families and policy section`
- `refactor(readme): reorganize umi methods into dexhand and teleoperation`
- `fix(readme): correct publication metadata for activeumi and dexumi`

## What to avoid

- Do not revert to the old multi-file `contents/` structure.
- Do not add long prose summaries for every paper.
- Do not turn the repo into a general manipulation survey.
- Do not introduce inconsistent table schemas across sections.
- Do not add entries without checking their UMI relevance.

## Quick checklist before finishing a change

- Is the entry clearly relevant to UMI core or strong adjacent scope?
- Is it in the right section?
- Should it also appear in another section?
- Does the row use the six required columns?
- Is the date normalized and ordering correct?
- Are `Paper` and `Others` links canonical and working?
- Does the change preserve the single-README architecture?
