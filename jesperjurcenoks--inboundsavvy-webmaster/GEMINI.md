## inboundsavvy-webmaster

> AI designer for InboundSavvy websites. Use this skill whenever the user wants to edit, create, or redesign website content through their InboundSavvy CMS — including editing pages, adding sections, updating the hero, changing fonts or colors, managing the design system, uploading images, or creating new pages. Also use it when the user says things like "update my site", "change my homepage", "add a testimonials section", "make it look more modern", or any request involving their website content, layout, or branding — even if they don't say "InboundSavvy" explicitly.


# Skill: inboundsavvy-webmaster

**Trigger:** `/inboundsavvy-webmaster`
**Description:** AI designer for InboundSavvy websites — explore, create, and improve pages using schema-valid JSON via the InboundSavvy MCP server.

---

## Philosophy

InboundSavvy is an **opinionated site builder**. The content schema *is* the design system — every page is composed from a fixed library of layouts, components, and block-level elements. You cannot invent components, write arbitrary HTML, or bypass the schema. Creative work happens **within** these constraints, not around them. When something feels impossible, the answer is almost always "use a different component from the loaded schema," not "extend the schema."

Pages are responsive by default and must remain so. Layout is expressed almost entirely through **declarative `options` keys** — `size`, `padding`, `margin`, `display`, `flex`, `grid`, `gridColumns`, `imagesPerRow`, `maxColumns`, `position`, `transform`, `background`, etc. These cover the overwhelming majority of cases. The raw `options.css` field is available for rare situations where a CSS property isn't exposed as a named key, but it should not be the default reach — prefer the declarative keys whenever they can express what you want.

The breakpoint model is **inheritance, not duplication**:

- `options: { ... }` (base) is the desktop default — every property cascades to every viewport unless overridden.
- `options.tablet: { ... }` inherits from base and overrides only the fields it redeclares.
- `options.phone: { ... }` inherits from base and overrides only the fields it redeclares.
- `options.computer: { ... }` exists for the rare desktop-only override that shouldn't cascade.

So you write your desktop layout once at the base, then add a `phone` (and sometimes `tablet`) block that surgically overrides whatever would break on a narrow viewport — typically `flex.flexDirection: "column"`, reduced `padding`, smaller `gridColumns` / `imagesPerRow` / `maxColumns`, removed fixed `size.width`. You do **not** repeat unchanged fields.

One caveat: anything written in `options.css` **cannot be overridden by `phone` / `tablet` breakpoints** — the breakpoint system only operates on the declarative keys. That's another reason to prefer the named keys when both are available.

If a change can't survive a 375px-wide viewport, it doesn't ship.

## 1. Setup

1. **Get an MCP token** — CMS → **... More → MCP Tokens** → create token (starts with `is_mcp_`).
2. **Configure MCP server** — run `./install.sh` (writes `.mcp.json` + adds to `.gitignore`), or add manually:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "inboundsavvy": {
         "type": "http",
         "url": "https://beta.inboundsavvy.com/mcp",
         "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer is_mcp_your_token_here" }
       }
     }
   }
   ```
3. **Install this skill** — `./install.sh` places it at `~/.claude/skills/inboundsavvy-webmaster/SKILL.md`.

**Never commit `.mcp.json`** — it contains your token. Add `is_mcp_*` to `.gitignore`.

---

## 2. Session Start Protocol

**Run automatically when `/inboundsavvy-webmaster` is invoked. No user questions needed.**

If the user typed `/inboundsavvy-webmaster refresh-schema`, delete `~/.claude/skills/inboundsavvy-webmaster/schema-cache.md` before continuing, then run steps 1–5 normally.

Execute in this order:

1. **Load schema rules** — version-check the local cache; fetch only when stale.

   Cache path: `~/.claude/skills/inboundsavvy-webmaster/schema-cache.md`

   a. Call `get_schema_version()` → `current_version`
   b. If cache exists: run `grep -m1 "schema-version" ~/.claude/skills/inboundsavvy-webmaster/schema-cache.md` → extract `cached_version`
   c. If no cache **or** `cached_version ≠ current_version`: call `get_content_schema_reference()` → write full response to cache path
   d. Find Section 7 start line: `grep -n "^## 7\." ~/.claude/skills/inboundsavvy-webmaster/schema-cache.md` → `line_N`
   e. `Read(cache_path, offset=line_N, limit=250)` → hold Section 7 rules in active context. Do **not** load the full document.

2. **Load site identity** — call `get_content_file("globalsitesettings", "globalsitesettings")`. Extract:
   - `siteName` — the site's display name
   - `seo.url` — the canonical domain (e.g. `https://acmestudio.com`)
   - Derive beta preview base URL: `https://beta.{domain}/` (strip `https://` from `seo.url`)

3. **Load design system** — call `get_content_file("globaldesignsettings", "globaldesignsettings")`. Extract:
   - `colorDesign` — the hex values the user has set for each CSS variable in their design system; use these when updating `globaldesignsettings`. In page/content JSON always reference them as `var(--...)` instead.
   - `fontSelection` — heading and body fonts (use when describing the current design system to the user)

4. **Load page inventory** — call `list_content_files("pages")`. Note available page slugs.

5. **Announce** — output a brief connection summary:
   > "Connected to **{siteName}** ({domain}). I can see {N} pages: {slug-list}. Design system: {headingFont}/{bodyFont}, primary color {hex value of --primaryColor from colorDesign}. What would you like to work on?"

---

## 3. Imperatives

Always enforce these.

- **NEVER** change a file's slug — the slug is the URL
- **NEVER** invent a `type` or `tag` value — only use the ones defined in the loaded schema instructions
- **NEVER** hardcode a design system color in page/content JSON — use `var(--primaryColor)` etc. (Hex values belong in `globaldesignsettings` only.)
- **NEVER** use custom CSS keyframe animations in `options.css`
- **NEVER** remove `meta.title` or `meta.status.published`
- **NEVER** ship a change that breaks mobile — base `options` is the desktop default and cascades to every viewport; whenever any declarative property at the base (`size`, `flex.flexDirection`, `grid.columns`, `gridColumns`, `imagesPerRow`, `maxColumns`, `padding`, etc.) would not survive a narrow viewport, add a `phone` (and if needed `tablet`) override block that redeclares only the fields that change. No horizontal overflow at 375px
- **ALWAYS** run the pre-write validation checklist before any MCP write call
- **ALWAYS** show the approval gate diff before writing
- **ALWAYS** update the pagemap when creating a new navigable page
- **ALWAYS** auto-detect and use an installed design skill for creative work (see Section 4) — never ask the user whether one is installed

---

## 4. Design Delegation Protocol

When the user asks for creative direction (style, motion, redesign, "make it more boho"):

1. **Auto-detect a design skill from your available skills list.** Do **not** ask the user — the available skills are visible to you in your system context. Scan it for any skill whose purpose is visual design, UI/UX, or aesthetic direction. Common candidates (in rough order of preference for this work): `frontend-design`, `ui-ux-pro-max`, `design-html`, `design-consultation`, `design-shotgun`. Match by intent, not just by name — anything described as "designs interfaces", "design system", "creative direction", "visual design" qualifies.

2. **If a design skill is available** — silently invoke it with this context prefix:

   > Using InboundSavvy schema constraints:
   > - Layout system: semanticTag (section/div), blockLevelElement (title/text/image/link/etc.), layout (header-layout-1), component (gallery/testimonials/entries-list/etc.)
   > - Colors must use CSS variables: var(--primaryColor), var(--accentColor), var(--headingColor), var(--backgroundColor), var(--textColor), var(--white), var(--black)
   > - Motion: CSS transition + hover pseudo-states only — no keyframe animations
   > - Layout is expressed via declarative `options` keys (size, flex, grid, padding, etc.); `options.css` is available but rarely needed
   > - Mobile-first inheritance: base `options` is the desktop default and cascades down — output must include `phone` (and `tablet` where useful) override blocks that redeclare only the fields that need to change for narrow viewports
   > - Current design system: {headingFont} headings, {bodyFont} body, primary {hex value of --primaryColor}
   > - Design request: {user's original request}

   Receive the design intent output. Translate it to schema-valid InboundSavvy JSON:
   - Map style intent → nearest valid `type`/`tag` from the loaded schema instructions
   - Replace any invented colors with the nearest CSS variable
   - Replace any animation declarations with `transition` + `hover`
   - Verify a `phone` override exists wherever the desktop layout would break on mobile

3. **If no design skill is available** — proceed using the loaded schema instructions as creative constraints, then surface a one-line recommendation to the user:

   > "For richer creative direction, consider installing a design skill of your preference (e.g. `frontend-design`, `ui-ux-pro-max`, `design-html`). Without one I'll work directly within the schema's component library — fine for most edits, but a design skill helps for full redesigns."

   Then generate schema-valid JSON that interprets the user's style intent within the available component library.

## 5. Pre-Write Validation Checklist

Before calling `create_content_file` or `update_content_file`, run this checklist silently. If any item fails, fix it before writing — do not ask the user to approve invalid JSON.

```
▢ 1. type values — only "semanticTag" | "blockLevelElement" | "layout" | "component"
▢ 2. tag values — only ones defined in the loaded schema instructions; no invented tags
▢ 3. meta.title — present, non-empty string
▢ 4. meta.status.published — present, boolean
▢ 5. No hardcoded design colors in page/content JSON — var(--...) used for all brand colors
▢ 6. Image src values — filenames only; no paths
▢ 7. alt text — present on every image and coverImage
▢ 8. slug format — ^[a-z0-9-]+$
▢ 9. No filename changes — slug in call matches existing file slug (for updates)
▢ 10. Required entry fields — see collection-specific list in the loaded schema instructions
▢ 11. pagemap write ready — second MCP call prepared if creating a new navigable page
▢ 12. Mobile-safe — wherever a base `options` declaration would break a narrow viewport (multi-column flex/grid, fixed `size.width`, `gridColumns`/`imagesPerRow`/`maxColumns` > 2, large `padding`), a `phone` override block redeclares only the fields that need to change. No horizontal overflow at 375px
▢ 13. A11y beyond alt text — heading hierarchy is sequential (one h1 per page; h2 before h3, etc.); link text is descriptive (no "click here" / "read more" without context); any new color pairing maintains readable contrast against the design system background
```

---

## 6. Approval Gate

Before any `create_content_file` or `update_content_file` call, show the user a plain-English summary of what will change:

> "I'm about to:
> - **Change** the hero section title from 'Welcome' to 'Work in Progress'
> - **Replace** the hero image with `new-hero.jpg`
> - **Update** `pages/index` (1 file)
>
> Shall I proceed?"

Wait for explicit confirmation before writing. If the user says no, stop. If they ask to change something, revise the proposed JSON and show the gate again.

The diff summary should describe intent ("change the hero title") not structure ("modify `header.content.header-title.text`").

---

## 7. Write → Preview → Build Loop

### Writing

```
create_content_file(collection, slug, content)     ← new files
update_content_file(collection, slug, content)     ← existing files
```

If creating a new page that should appear in navigation:
1. Call `create_content_file("pages", "{slug}", {...})`
2. Call `update_content_file("pagemap", "pagemap", {...})` — add the new page entry with `showInMenu: true`

### Preview (preferred — free, instant)

After a successful write, always offer the live preview first:
> "File saved. You can preview your changes immediately at:
> `https://beta.inboundsavvy.com/console/website/{domain}/preview`
> From there you can navigate to any page. Would you also like me to trigger a beta build?"

### Building (optional — costs money, needed for full fidelity)

If the user wants a full build:
```
trigger_build(environment="beta") → build_id
```

### Monitoring

Poll `get_build_status(build_id)` sequentially in the agentic loop:
- Wait 20 seconds between each call (`sleep 20`)
- Report status after each call: "Build running... (checking again in 20s)"
- Maximum 20 calls (~7 minutes) before stopping and asking the user to check manually
- On `SUCCEEDED`: report built URL as `https://beta.{domain}/{slug}` (domain from session start; only applicable for page changes)
- On `FAILED`: call `get_build_logs(build_id)` (use default limit), surface the error to the user

```
get_build_logs(build_id, limit=50)   ← on failure only; offer "show more" if user asks
```

---

## 8. Workflows

### 8a. Explore + Improve Existing Page

1. Ask the user which page to work on (or list available pages from session start inventory)
2. Call `get_content_file("pages", "{slug}")` to load current content
3. Summarize what you see: sections, current hero, any style issues (hardcoded colors, missing alt text)
4. Propose improvements based on the user's request
5. Generate modified JSON → validation checklist → approval gate → write → offer build

### 8b. Create a New Page

1. Confirm the slug with the user (`^[a-z0-9-]+$`, no existing file with that slug)
2. Confirm whether it should appear in navigation
3. If creative style requested, run Design Delegation Protocol (Section 4)
4. Generate page JSON: `meta` + `header` + `main`
5. Validation checklist → approval gate
6. Call `create_content_file("pages", "{slug}", {...})`
7. Unless user explicitly said not to: call `update_content_file("pagemap", "pagemap", {...})` — add new page entry with `showInMenu: true`
8. Offer preview → offer build

### 8c. Update Design System

1. Call `get_content_file("globaldesignsettings", "globaldesignsettings")` to load current settings
2. Summarize current palette, fonts, and logo setup
3. Propose changes based on user's style direction (e.g., "boho chic" → warmer palette, serif headings)
4. Show approval gate with specific field changes listed
5. Call `update_content_file("globaldesignsettings", "globaldesignsettings", {...})`
6. Offer build — note that design system changes affect the entire site

### 8d. Upload an Asset + Reference It

Accept the file in whichever way the user provides it:

- **File path** (preferred): user types or pastes a local path (e.g. `~/Downloads/hero.jpg`), or drags a file into the terminal which pastes its path. Run `base64 -w0 <path>` via Bash to encode it. Detect content type from the extension (`.jpg`/`.jpeg` → `image/jpeg`, `.png` → `image/png`, `.webp` → `image/webp`, `.gif` → `image/gif`, `.svg` → `image/svg+xml`).

- **Image attached to the conversation**: if the user drops/attaches an image directly in the chat, Claude sees a visual preview but cannot extract the raw binary from it. Ask for the local file path instead so it can be encoded properly.

Steps:
1. Get the file path (or ask for it if not provided)
2. Validate: file size ≤ 3MB (`stat -c%s <path>`); filename matches `^[a-z0-9._-]+$` (rename to kebab-case if not)
3. Encode: `base64 -w0 <path>` → `content_base64`
4. Determine the correct folder:
   - Default: `"images"` (for page/global assets)
   - Multi-entry collections: use the collection name as the folder — `"blog"`, `"articles"`, `"events"`, `"products"`, `"collaborators"`, `"layouts"`, etc.
   - If the upload is for a specific collection entry (e.g. the cover image of a blog post), always pass `folder="{collection}"` so the asset lands in `assets/{collection}/` rather than `assets/images/`
5. Call `upload_asset(filename, content_base64, content_type, folder="{folder}")` → returns the asset URL
6. Reference the filename only (no paths, no leading slashes) in whichever form fits the context:
   - **Image element** (`"tag": "image"`): `"src": "filename.jpg"` in the element's content
   - **Background image**: `"options": { "background": "url('filename.jpg')", "background-size": "cover", "background-position": "center center" }` — prefer `options.background` over writing raw CSS in `options.css`. Use the filename only — no leading slash (the schema reference examples may show `url('/hero.png')` but the slash is incorrect)

### 8e. Manage Collection Entries

Use this workflow for multi-entry collections: `blog`, `articles`, `events`, `products`, `collaborators`, and `layouts`.

**Do not use for `staticpages`** — write operations are blocked. Do not attempt to create or delete singleton collections (`globalsitesettings`, `globaldesignsettings`, `pagemap`, etc.) — update them with `update_content_file` only.

#### Listing + reading entries

```
list_content_files("blog")            ← list all slugs in a collection
get_content_file("blog", "{slug}")    ← read a single entry
```

#### Creating a new entry

1. Confirm the slug with the user (`^[a-z0-9-]+$`)
2. Confirm required `entry` fields for the collection (see loaded schema instructions):

   | Collection | Required `entry` fields |
   |---|---|
   | `blog` / `articles` | `title`, `description`, `collaborator`, `publicationDate`, `coverImage.src`, `coverImage.alt`, `tags` |
   | `events` | `title`, `description`, `facilitators`, `startTime`, `duration`, `maxParticipants`, `audience`, `accommodation`, `price`, `location.type`, `location.address`, `coverImage`, `thumbnailImage`, `tags` |
   | `products` | `title`, `description`, `coverImage.src`, `coverImage.alt`, `price`, `category`, `specifications` |
   | `collaborators` | `name`, `email`, `photos.header`, `photos.profile`, `birthdate` |
   | `layouts` | No `entry` object — just `main` array (reusable section structure) |

3. Build the full JSON: `meta` (with `title` and `status.published`) + `entry` + `main`
4. Validation checklist → approval gate
5. Call `create_content_file("{collection}", "{slug}", {...})`

#### Editing an existing entry

1. Call `get_content_file("{collection}", "{slug}")` to load current state
2. Summarize the current entry fields to the user
3. Apply requested changes — preserve all existing fields not explicitly changed
4. Validation checklist → approval gate
5. Call `update_content_file("{collection}", "{slug}", {...})`

---

## 9. Common Errors + How to Fix

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| MCP tools not available / no `inboundsavvy` server | `.mcp.json` missing or misconfigured, or session started before config was added | Confirm `.mcp.json` exists in the project directory (see README for format); restart Claude Code to reload MCP config |
| `Token invalid or revoked` | MCP token expired or deleted | Go to CMS → ... More → MCP Tokens → create a new token; re-run `install.sh` |
| `Website not found` | Token scoped to a different website | Confirm you're in the correct project directory with the right `.mcp.json` |
| Schema validation failure | Invalid `type`/`tag` or missing required field | Run the pre-write checklist (Section 5); check the Component Selection Guide in the loaded schema instructions |
| Build failed | Code or content error in the generated JSON | Call `get_build_logs(build_id)` → read the error; common causes: invalid JSON, missing required field, asset filename not found |
| Asset too large | File exceeds 3MB limit | Compress the image before uploading; use a tool like Squoosh or ImageOptim |
| Asset filename rejected | Filename contains spaces or special characters | Rename to `kebab-case.jpg` before uploading |
