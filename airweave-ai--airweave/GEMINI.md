# Airweave Sync Architecture - Deep Dive

## Overview

The sync module orchestrates data flow from sources to destinations using a highly concurrent, pull-based asynchronous architecture with sophisticated backpressure control, real-time progress tracking, and automatic OAuth token management.

## Core Architecture Principles

### 1. Pull-Based Concurrency Model
- **Worker Pool Pattern**: Uses `AsyncWorkerPool` with semaphore-controlled concurrency (default: 20 workers)
- **Pull vs Push**: Workers pull entities from the stream only when ready, preventing system overload
- **Backpressure**: `AsyncSourceStream` uses bounded queues (default: 10000) to naturally throttle producers

### 2. Separation of Concerns
- **Producer/Consumer Decoupling**: Source generation runs independently from entity processing
- **Modular Pipeline**: Each stage (enrich, transform, vectorize, persist) is isolated
- **Resource Isolation**: Database sessions created only when needed to minimize connection usage

## Component Deep Dive

### SyncFactory
**Purpose**: Factory that builds SyncContext (data), SyncRuntime (services), and wires them into the orchestrator

**Key Responsibilities**:
- Builds SyncContext (frozen data) via SyncContextBuilder
- Builds source + cursor directly via `_build_source()` (uses SourceLifecycleService)
- Builds destinations via DestinationsContextBuilder
- Builds entity tracker via `_build_entity_tracker()` (inlined, no separate builder)
- Assembles SyncRuntime from per-sync state
- Configures contextual logging with sync metadata
- Wires pipelines, handlers, worker pool, and stream

**DI Model**: Instance-based with constructor-injected deps. Stateless app-scoped services (event_bus, usage_checker, processor, arf_service) are held by the factory and injected directly into consumers (SyncOrchestrator, EntityPipeline), not stored in SyncRuntime.

### SyncContext (frozen data)
**Purpose**: Immutable data describing a sync run. Inherits from `BaseContext` (sibling to `ApiContext`).

**Fields** (flat, no sub-contexts):
- `sync_id`, `sync_job_id`, `collection_id`, `source_connection_id`: Scope IDs
- `sync`, `sync_job`, `collection`, `connection`: Schema objects
- `execution_config`, `force_full_sync`, `batch_size`, `max_batch_latency_ms`: Config
- `entity_map`: Maps entity types to UUIDs
- `source_short_name`: Derived from source at build time
- From `BaseContext`: `organization`, `user`, `logger`

Can be passed directly as `ctx` to CRUD operations (it IS a `BaseContext`).

### SyncRuntime (live services)
**Purpose**: Holds per-sync mutable state for a sync run. Separate from SyncContext.

**Fields**:
- `source`: Source instance with OAuth token management
- `cursor`: Mutable sync cursor for incremental syncs
- `destinations`: List of destination instances
- `entity_tracker`: Centralized entity state tracker

Stateless singletons (event_bus, usage_checker, embedders) are NOT stored here — they are DI'd directly into their consumers via constructor injection.

Built by the factory, held by the orchestrator, injected into pipeline/handler constructors.

### Builders
- **SyncContextBuilder** (`builders/sync.py`): Builds data-only SyncContext
- **SyncFactory._build_source()**: Builds source + cursor directly (uses SourceLifecycleService), returns `SourceBuildResult`
- **DestinationsContextBuilder** (`builders/destinations.py`): Builds destination instances
- **SyncFactory._build_entity_tracker()**: Builds EntityTracker with initial counts (inlined into factory)

The factory calls build helpers in sequence, then assembles SyncRuntime.

### SyncOrchestrator
**Purpose**: Coordinates the entire sync workflow with error handling and progress tracking

**Workflow Stages**:
1. **Start**: Updates job status to IN_PROGRESS
2. **Process**: Manages entity streaming and concurrent processing
3. **Complete/Fail**: Updates final status with statistics

**Key Methods**:
- `run()`: Main entry point with try/catch for proper cleanup
- `_process_entities()`: Implements pull-based processing loop
- `_handle_completed_tasks()`: Cleans completed tasks and checks for errors
- `_wait_for_remaining_tasks()`: Ensures all tasks complete before finishing

**Constructor-Injected Services**: Receives `event_bus`, `usage_checker`, `usage_ledger`, and `sync_cursor_service` directly via constructor — not through SyncRuntime.

**Concurrency Management**:
```python
# Workers pull entities only when ready
async for entity in stream.get_entities():
    if entity.airweave_system_metadata.should_skip:
        # Skip without using a worker
        await sync_context.entity_tracker.record_skipped(1)
        continue

    # Submit to worker pool (blocks if all workers busy)
    task = await worker_pool.submit(...)
```

### AsyncSourceStream
**Purpose**: Manages async streaming with backpressure between producer and consumer

**Architecture**:
- **Producer Task**: Runs independently, filling queue from source generator
- **Bounded Queue**: Implements backpressure (blocks producer when full)
- **Consumer Interface**: `get_entities()` yields items as they become available
- **Error Propagation**: Producer exceptions are captured and re-raised to consumer

**Key Features**:
- Context manager support for proper resource cleanup
- Progress logging every 50 items
- Graceful shutdown with timeout handling
- Sentinel value (None) signals end of stream

### EntityPipeline
**Purpose**: Orchestrates entity processing through the action/handler architecture

**Pipeline Stages**:
1. **Track & Dedupe**: EntityTracker records encounter, skips duplicates
2. **Prepare**: Populate fields, enrich metadata, compute content hash
3. **Resolve Actions**: EntityActionResolver determines INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/KEEP
4. **Dispatch**: EntityActionDispatcher routes actions to handlers concurrently

**Action Types** (`domains/sync_pipeline/entity/actions.py`):
- `InsertAction`: New entity, not in database
- `UpdateAction`: Hash changed from stored value
- `DeleteAction`: DeletionEntity from source
- `KeepAction`: Hash matches stored value (no-op)

**Handlers** (`domains/sync_pipeline/entity/handlers/`):
| Handler | Responsibility | Execution |
|---------|----------------|-----------|
| `DestinationHandler` | Chunking → embedding → vector DB writes | Concurrent |
| `ArfHandler` | Captures raw entities to ARF storage via `ArfService` | Concurrent |
| `PostgresHandler` | Persists entity metadata | Sequential (last) |

**Error Handling**:
- Catches exceptions per entity (doesn't fail entire sync)
- Marks failed entities as "skipped" via EntityTracker
- Detailed error logging with entity context

### SyncDAGRouter
**Purpose**: Routes entities through transformation pipeline based on DAG structure

**Key Components**:
- **Execution Route**: Pre-computed routing map for O(1) lookups
- **Transformer Cache**: Pre-loaded transformers to avoid database queries
- **Entity Lineage**: Tracks parent-child relationships through transformations

**Routing Logic**:
```python
# Route map: (producer_node_id, entity_type_id) -> consumer_node_id
route_map[(producer, entity_definition_short_name)] = consumer_node_id

# Special case: routes to destination return None (stops routing)
if all_edges_go_to_destinations:
    route_map[key] = None
```

**Advanced Features**:
- Handles multi-path routing through DAG
- Optimized for chunk processing (files → chunks)

### AsyncWorkerPool
**Purpose**: Controls concurrent task execution with semaphore-based limiting

**Implementation Details**:
- **Semaphore Control**: Limits active tasks (prevents resource exhaustion)
- **Task Tracking**: Maintains set of pending tasks with cleanup callbacks
- **Detailed Logging**: Tracks task lifecycle (submit → wait → start → complete)
- **Thread Awareness**: Logs thread IDs for debugging concurrency issues

**Key Methods**:
- `submit()`: Creates task and adds to tracking set
- `_run_with_semaphore()`: Wraps coroutine with semaphore acquisition
- `_handle_task_completion()`: Cleans up completed/failed tasks

### EntityTracker
**Purpose**: Centralized entity state tracking (dedup + progress + encounter tracking)

**Responsibilities**:
- **Deduplication**: Tracks `(entity_id, entity_definition_short_name)` to prevent reprocessing
- **Encounter Counting**: Maintains count of entities by type for stats
- **Progress Stats**: Thread-safe counters for inserted/updated/deleted/kept/skipped

**Key Methods**:
- `track()`: Records entity encounter, returns False if duplicate
- `record_action()`: Increments stat counter (inserted, updated, etc.)
- `get_stats()`: Returns `SyncStats` for job completion
- `get_all_encountered_ids_flat()`: Returns set of all entity IDs (for orphan cleanup)

### SyncProgressRelay (EventSubscriber)
**Purpose**: Event-driven subscriber that relays sync progress to Redis pubsub for real-time updates

**Architecture**:
- Extends `EventSubscriber`, subscribes to `entity.*`, `access_control.*`, and `sync.*` events on the EventBus
- Sessions are auto-created on `sync.running` events — no factory wiring needed
- Accumulates progress in per-sync sessions, publishes aggregated updates

**Features**:
- **Event-Driven**: Reacts to `EntityBatchProcessedEvent`, `SyncLifecycleEvent`, etc.
- **Redis Integration**: Publishes to `sync_job:{job_id}` channels
- **Snapshot Storage**: Stores progress snapshots with TTL for stuck job detection

**Redis Snapshot Storage**:
- Key: `sync_progress_snapshot:{job_id}`
- Includes `last_update_timestamp` for cleanup job to detect stuck syncs
- 30-minute TTL to automatically clean up completed syncs

### TokenManager
**Purpose**: Manages OAuth2 token refresh for long-running syncs

**Key Features**:
- **Automatic Refresh**: Refreshes tokens before expiry (25-minute intervals)
- **Concurrent Refresh Prevention**: Uses async lock to prevent duplicate refreshes
- **Direct Injection**: Supports non-refreshable tokens (skips refresh)

**Refresh Logic**:
```python
# Only refreshes for specific auth types
if auth_type in (AuthType.oauth2_with_refresh, AuthType.oauth2_with_refresh_rotating):
    # Refresh if older than 25 minutes
    if time_since_refresh > REFRESH_INTERVAL_SECONDS:
        await self._refresh_token()
```

### Async Helpers
**Purpose**: Performance utilities for CPU-bound operations

**Key Utilities**:
- **Shared Thread Pool**: Reuses executor for all CPU-bound tasks
- **Async Hashing**: Non-blocking file/content hashing
- **Stable Serialization**: Consistent object serialization for hashing
- **Chunked File Reading**: Memory-efficient file processing

## Orphaned Workflow Self-Destruct

**Problem**: Workflows may execute after their sync/source_connection is deleted (race condition between schedule deletion and queued workflows).

**Solution**: Self-healing workflows that detect orphaned state and clean up automatically.

**Detection Points**:
1. **Early** (in `create_sync_job_activity`): Checks if sync exists before creating job
   - Returns `CreateSyncJobResult(orphaned=True, sync_id=..., reason=...)` if not found
2. **Late** (in `run_sync_activity`): Catches `NotFoundException` during execution
   - Domain code raises `OrphanedSyncError(sync_id)` (in `exceptions.py`)
   - Activity boundary converts to explicit `ApplicationError` with:
     - `type=ORPHANED_SYNC_ERROR_TYPE` (shared constant in `exceptions.py`)
     - `non_retryable=True` (permanent condition)
     - `category=ApplicationErrorCategory.BENIGN` (suppresses error metrics/logs)
     - Structured `details`: `(sync_id, reason)` accessible on workflow side

**Temporal serialization**: The workflow detects orphaned syncs by checking
`error.cause.type == ORPHANED_SYNC_ERROR_TYPE` on the `ApplicationError` inside
the `ActivityError` wrapper. Structured details are accessed via `error.cause.details`.
The `BENIGN` category prevents orphaned syncs from polluting error metrics and
OpenTelemetry traces since they are expected operational behavior.

**Self-Destruct Flow**:
```python
if self._is_orphaned_sync_error(e):
    reason = self._extract_orphaned_reason(e)  # from ApplicationError.details
    await self._self_destruct(sync_dict, ctx_dict, reason)
    return  # Exit gracefully without error
```

**Cleanup Actions** (in `self_destruct_orphaned_sync_activity`):
- Deletes all schedule types: `sync-{id}`, `minute-sync-{id}`, `daily-cleanup-{id}`
- Uses existing `temporal_schedule_service.delete_schedule_handle()`
- Logs with INFO level, not ERROR
- Idempotent (safe for concurrent workflows)

**Result**: No "Source connection record not found" errors, graceful workflow exits, automatic schedule cleanup.


## Temporal Module Structure

Activities and workflows live under `domains/temporal/` with single-responsibility modules.

### Activities (`domains/temporal/activities/`)

Each activity is a `@dataclass` with explicit DI, one class per file:

| File | Class | Responsibility |
|------|-------|---------------|
| `run_sync.py` | `RunSyncActivity` | Execute a sync job with heartbeating and stall detection |
| `create_sync_job.py` | `CreateSyncJobActivity` | Create sync job record (for scheduled runs) |
| `transition_sync_job.py` | `TransitionSyncJobActivity` | Terminal state transitions via SyncJobStateMachine |
| `cleanup_stuck_sync_jobs.py` | `CleanupStuckSyncJobsActivity` | Detect and cancel stuck jobs |
| `self_destruct_orphaned_sync.py` | `SelfDestructOrphanedSyncActivity` | Clean up schedules for orphaned syncs |
| `cleanup_sync_data.py` | `CleanupSyncDataActivity` | Remove Vespa + ARF data for deleted syncs |
| `api_key_notifications.py` | `CheckAndNotifyExpiringKeysActivity` | Email notifications for expiring API keys |

`activities/__init__.py` re-exports both class names and `.run` method references (used by workflows).

### Workflows (`domains/temporal/workflows/`)

Each workflow is one class per file, using `workflow.unsafe.imports_passed_through()` for activity imports and named timeout/retry constants:

| File | Class |
|------|-------|
| `run_source_connection.py` | `RunSourceConnectionWorkflow` — four-phase orchestration |
| `cleanup_stuck_sync_jobs.py` | `CleanupStuckSyncJobsWorkflow` — periodic stuck-job cleanup |
| `cleanup_sync_data.py` | `CleanupSyncDataWorkflow` — post-deletion data cleanup |
| `api_key_notifications.py` | `APIKeyExpirationCheckWorkflow` |

### Worker Wiring (`domains/temporal/worker/`)

`wiring.py` is the DI wiring point: reads dependencies from `container` and instantiates activity dataclasses. `get_workflows()` returns the list of workflow classes.

### Domain Services (`domains/temporal/`)

- `service.py` — `TemporalWorkflowService`: start/cancel workflows
- `schedule_service.py` — `TemporalScheduleService`: CRUD for Temporal schedules
- `protocols.py` — Protocol definitions for the above

### Tests

Co-located alongside source code:
- `activities/tests/` — activity unit tests with fake dependencies
- `workflows/tests/` — workflow tests using `WorkflowEnvironment.start_time_skipping()` and mock activities
- `worker/tests/` — worker startup and config tests

## Best Practices

### When Extending
1. Maintain pull-based architecture
2. Use async locks for shared state
3. Create database sessions sparingly
4. Log with contextual information
5. Handle errors at entity level


### Common Pitfalls
1. Don't block the event loop
2. Avoid unbounded concurrency
3. Handle token refresh properly
4. Clean up resources in finally blocks
5. Test with large datasets

This architecture enables efficient processing of millions of entities with optimal resource usage, real-time monitoring, and robust error handling.
