## Customization

### Modifying Trigger Phrases
Edit the `description` field in each agent's frontmatter to add or modify trigger phrases. Include "PROACTIVELY USED" followed by the phrases.

### Changing Output Format
Modify the output format section in each agent's prompt. Keep it structured and LLM-optimized for best results.

### Switching Models
Change `model: sonnet` to `model: opus` in the frontmatter for more complex reasoning (higher cost).

### Adding Tools
Add tool names to the `tools:` list in the frontmatter. Ensure the tools are available in your Claude Code environment.

## Tips for Effective Usage

1. **Let agents work proactively**: Don't explicitly ask to use agents; just mention the keywords
2. **Use parallel execution**: Multiple agents can run simultaneously for different tasks
3. **Chain agent outputs**: Use one agent's output as context for another
4. **Keep agents updated**: Pull latest changes and re-run installer for updates

## Common Patterns

### Starting New Feature Work
```
"I'm starting work on PROJ-123, check if there's a PR already"
→ Triggers both atlas-jira-analyst and heimdall-pr-guardian
```

### Comprehensive PR Review
```
"Review PR #456"
→ Triggers athena-pr-reviewer (which orchestrates other agents)
```

### Code Review with Context
```
"Review PR #456 and check our coding standards in Notion"
→ Triggers athena-pr-reviewer and minerva-notion-oracle
```

### Checking PR Readiness
```
"Is my PR ready to merge? Check comments and status"
→ Triggers heimdall-pr-guardian
```

### Documentation Lookup
```
"Find our deployment process documentation"
→ Triggers minerva-notion-oracle
```

## Athena PR Reviewer (Skill)

### Purpose
Athena brings wisdom to code reviews through a multi-LLM approach. As a **skill** (not an agent), she orchestrates 8 parallel reviewers to provide comprehensive, confidence-scored feedback.

### Trigger Phrases (Proactive)
The skill automatically activates when you mention:
- "Review PR #..."
- "Review this pull request"
- "PR review"
- "Code review"
- "Review CSD-123" (Jira ticket)

### Architecture
Athena runs **8 reviewers in parallel**:

**External LLMs (via bash script):**
- **Gemini**: General code review with large context
- **Codex**: General code review from OpenAI

**Claude Specialists (via Task tool):**
1. **Comment Analyzer**: Documentation quality, technical debt markers
2. **Test Analyzer**: Test coverage gaps, missing edge cases
3. **Error Hunter**: Silent failures, missing error handling
4. **Type Reviewer**: Type design quality, type safety
5. **Code Reviewer**: General quality, bugs, security (uses Opus)
6. **Simplifier**: Unnecessary complexity, over-engineering

### Confidence Scoring
Each finding includes a confidence score (0-100):
- **90-100**: Certain - clear violation, verifiable
- **70-89**: Likely - probable issue, needs verification
- **50-69**: Possible - might be intentional
- **<50**: Not reported (too speculative)

### Consensus Boosting
Items flagged by 2+ reviewers get priority bumped:
| Reviewers | Original | Final |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| 3+ | High | Critical |
| 2 | High | Critical |
| 3+ | Medium | High |
| 2 | Medium | High |

### Data Gathering
The skill gathers comprehensive context via `gather-context.sh`:
- PR metadata and diff
- Jira ticket and epic context
- CLAUDE.md guidelines from repo
- Git blame for changed files
- Prior PR comments on same files

### Output Format
```markdown
# PR Review: {Title} (#{Number})

## Requirements Status
| Requirement | Status | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|

## Action Items

### Critical (consensus)
- [ ] file:line - issue - fix [Gemini + Codex + Claude-errors] (3+, avg 92%)

### High Priority
- [ ] file:line - issue - fix [Gemini + Claude-tests] ← boosted (2, avg 85%)

### Medium Priority
- [ ] file:line - issue - fix [Claude-simplify] (88%)

### Suggestions
- improvements

## Recommendation: APPROVE / REQUEST_CHANGES
```

### Example Usage
```
User: "Review PR #456"
Assistant: [Invokes athena-pr-reviewer skill which runs 8 parallel reviews]
```
