Guidance for Claude Code when working in this repository.

## What this is

**OpenFunnel** — an open-source, self-hostable alternative to Perspective.co /
Typeform. It renders JSON funnel documents into mobile-first, swipe-through quiz
funnels built for paid traffic, captures leads, and reports drop-off.

Bun workspace monorepo, AGPL-3.0-or-later, **zero runtime dependencies** (the
only `devDependencies` are `happy-dom` and `typescript`).

## Commands

```bash
bun install            # install workspaces
bun run dev            # runtime server with --watch on :3000  (apps/runtime)
bun run start          # runtime server, no watch
bun test               # full suite (engine + runtime smoke tests)
bun run typecheck      # tsc over the engine's JSDoc types + tsconfig.base.json
bun run demo           # zero-build static demo on :4321 (scripts/serve.mjs)

bun run scripts/check-no-deps.mjs         # no runtime deps in any workspace pkg
bun run scripts/check-engine-imports.mjs  # every engine import browser-resolvable
```

Run a single test file: `bun test packages/engine/test/logic.test.js`.

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs typecheck, the suite, and those two
invariant checks on every push and PR. The checks exist because both failures
they catch are invisible locally — Bun resolves a bare specifier and an
extensionless import happily, and the 404 only lands on a visitor's phone.

`bun test` (109 tests) and `bun run typecheck` both pass on `main` — keep it that
way. Two tests log expected warnings (`branch target "nope" not found`, an
invalid-URL `submitLead` failure); those are assertions about failure tolerance,
not breakage.

## Layout

```
packages/engine/     the funnel runtime — zero-dep browser ESM, no build step
apps/runtime/        the only backend — server.js (router) + lib/ + routes/
apps/app/            the console SPA (dashboard, builder, leads, analytics)
apps/builder/        legacy standalone builder UI  (superseded by apps/app)
apps/admin/          legacy standalone admin UI    (superseded by apps/app)
examples/*.json      funnel documents — this is the funnel "database"
demo/                offline zero-build demo page
.data/               JSONL lead/event sinks (gitignored)
```

### packages/engine

The engine mounts into any container in any framework and mutates nothing else.

- `src/types.js` — **JSDoc typedefs only, no runtime code.** This is the single
  source of truth for the funnel JSON contract. Change the contract here first.
- `src/controller.js` — the state machine. Owns `index`, `history`, `answers`,
  `lead`; mounts chrome; runs transitions; emits events; persists progress.
- `src/render/index.js` — builds the shared header, then dispatches on
  `step.type` to `choice` / `multiselect` / `form` / `content` / `loader` /
  `success`. `landing` is the one exception and returns *before* the header is
  built — see below.
- `src/render/landing.js` — the `landing` step: a full marketing page (hero,
  background media, nav, sticky CTA, sections, footer) whose CTAs advance into
  the quiz. It is what a cold ad click lands on, so a funnel is "landing page →
  questions → lead" in one document. Two rules it breaks on purpose:
  it owns the whole screen (no shared header — the hero draws its own eyebrow /
  headline / subtext, and drawing both prints the headline twice), and
  `step.blocks` is the page body *below* the hero rather than content above an
  interaction. Every section a page could want is therefore an ordinary
  `ContentBlock`, not a landing-only field, so adding one benefits every step
  type at once. The progress bar defaults to hidden on a landing step
  (`progress: true` overrides), and `width: "wide"` breaks the 9:16 phone frame
  on desktop via `data-width` on the root.
- `src/branching.js` — `resolveNext()`. Precedence: the interaction's `next` →
  the step's own `next` → linear fall-through. `null` ends the funnel.
- `src/piping.js` — `{{token}}` substitution from `lead` first, then `answers`.
  Unknown tokens render empty; a visitor must never see raw `{{...}}`.
- `src/analytics.js` — **ad-platform pixels only** (Meta, GA4/GTM, TikTok).
- `src/leads.js` — **your own backend only** (`/api/lead`, `/api/events`).
  Also captures UTM and click-id params (`gclid`, `fbclid`, `ttclid`, `ref`).
  These two files are separate on purpose; don't merge them.
- `src/theme.js` — funnel `theme` JSON → `--of-*` CSS custom properties, plus the
  eight `THEME_PRESETS` (`midnight-glass`, `neo-brutalist`, `warm-editorial`,
  `saas-gradient`, `clean-light`, `emerald-glow`, `violet-pulse`,
  `sunset-coral`). Also the only file in the engine that makes a third-party
  request: `loadThemeFont()` / `applyTheme(root, theme, { allowRemote })` fetch a
  non-system `theme.font` from Google Fonts. It stays independent of `consent.js`
  — the decision is passed in as a boolean.
- `src/consent.js` — the consent bar and the `marketingAllowed()` / `consentSignal()`
  gate for third-party sharing. Its header defines what is and is not gated.
- `src/persist.js` — localStorage resume. Fails silently by design.

### apps/runtime

`Bun.serve`, no framework. `server.js` is the router and nothing else (~175
lines): it owns the order routes are tried in and the admin gate, and delegates
to `lib/` and `routes/`.

```
server.js            Bun.serve + route order + the privileged gate
lib/config.js        paths, env, SLUG_RE, isInside — imports nothing else
lib/log.js           oneLine, errSummary
lib/http.js          responses, CORS surface, readJson, clientIp
lib/ratelimit.js     the buckets, tooMany, MAIL_HOURLY_CAP
lib/auth.js          safeEqual, loopback trust, requireAdmin, PRIVILEGED_PREFIXES
lib/funnels.js       load/list/cache + publicFunnel redaction
lib/preview.js       hasPreviewFlag, isPreviewRecord
lib/webhook.js       egress guard (resolveSafeTarget) + delivery
lib/capi.js          Meta Conversions API forward
lib/email.js         settings, transports, OTP, lead notifications
lib/html.js          esc, jsonScript, themeVars, funnelPage
lib/csp.js           FUNNEL_BOOT_SCRIPT, its hash, custom code, funnelCsp
lib/static.js        console + engine asset serving
lib/ai.js            provider calls, parseJsonFromAiText
routes/*.js          one module per surface; each returns null to fall through
```

`lib/config.js` is the bottom of the dependency graph and imports nothing from
the runtime — keep it that way and import cycles cannot start.

A route module exports `handle<Name>(req, ctx)` where `ctx` is
`{ url, path, server }`, returning a `Response` or `null` to fall through.
Adding a route means adding it to the right module; adding a *surface* means a
new module plus one dispatch line in `server.js`.

Routes:

| Route | Auth | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /f/:slug` | public | funnel page — HTML shell with the funnel JSON inlined |
| `GET /_of/*` | public | engine source served raw, mirroring `packages/engine/src` |
| `GET /_app/*`, `/`, `/builder`, `/leads`, … | public | console shell (see `APP_ROUTES`) |
| `GET /api/funnels`, `/api/funnels/:slug` | public | funnel list / document |
| `POST /api/lead`, `/api/events` | public, rate-limited | ingest → JSONL + Supabase + webhook |
| `POST /api/otp/send`, `/api/otp/verify` | public, rate-limited | email verification challenge |
| `GET /healthz` | public | liveness |
| `POST /api/builder/save\|delete\|duplicate` | **admin** | writes JSON into `FUNNELS_DIR` |
| `GET /api/admin/leads`, `/api/admin/stats` | **admin** | console data, preview-filtered |
| `GET\|POST /api/admin/email-settings` | **admin** | mail config; secrets never returned |
| `POST /api/admin/test-email` | **admin** | send a test message |
| `POST /api/ai/generate`, `/api/ai/improve-copy` | **admin** | copilot (OpenAI optional) |

Only the console shell is public; every API behind it is not. The `/f/:slug`
page and the ingest endpoints are the entire public API surface.

**Meta Conversions API.** `persist()` also forwards to Meta server-side via
`forwardMetaCapi`, opt-in through `META_PIXEL_ID` + `META_CAPI_TOKEN` (env only,
never per funnel, never from the request body).

The token goes in the **URL query string**, because that is the only form Meta
documents for a JSON payload to this endpoint. Moving it into the JSON body or an
`Authorization` header looks tidier and was tried — but neither is verified for
`/events`, and a silent `400` would disable conversion tracking with nothing but
a status code in the log. Do not "fix" this.

That puts a credential in the URL, so the containment is entirely on the logging
side and is **not optional**: a fetch failure is logged through `errSummary(err)`,
never as the error object, because Bun puts the full request URL on `err.path` and
`console.warn("…", err)` would print the token. `forwardWebhook`, the relay, the
Resend and Supabase calls all follow the same rule for the same reason.

### apps/app

Client-routed SPA. Views are `<section id="view-*">` blocks in `index.html`;
state is one working funnel document (`state.funnel`) edited in the builder,
previewed live in an iframe via `postMessage`, and saved back through
`/api/builder/save`. `Cmd/Ctrl+K` opens the command palette, `Cmd/Ctrl+S` saves,
`1`–`6` switch views.

Workspace-level settings (workspace name, domain, currency, language, lead
notification email, global head/CSS injection, GDPR bar, AI provider/model/key/
brand voice) live in `localStorage` under `of.*` keys, listed in the `SETTINGS`
table in `app.js`. They are per-browser, not per-funnel and not server-side.

## Invariants — do not break these

**No build step.** The browser imports engine source directly. Every import in
`packages/engine/src` must be a relative, browser-resolvable ESM specifier, and
the engine must never gain an npm dependency. This is the whole reason a funnel
is fast on 4G.

**Ingest must never fail a visitor.** `/api/lead` and `/api/events` return `202`
immediately and persist in the background; `persist()` fans out with
`Promise.allSettled` so a dead webhook or Supabase outage is a `console.warn`,
never a `500`. Client-side, `leads.js` uses `sendBeacon` with a `keepalive`
fetch fallback and swallows errors.

**Preview traffic must never pollute analytics.** Two independent guards, and
new code needs both: `Controller._emit()` bails when `isPreview` or
`?preview=1` / `?admin=1`, and the server's `isPreviewRecord()` filters records
out of `/api/admin/*`. The builder iframe depends on this.

`isPreviewRecord` parses the query string; it must never substring-match.
`referer.includes("preview=1")` also fires on
`?utm_campaign=spring-preview=1-sale`, and because this predicate decides whether
a lead is persisted at all, anyone circulating a link with those nine characters
buried in it silently destroyed every lead that came through — no log, and a 202
back to the visitor so the funnel looked fine. It is also type-guarded, because
`meta.url` is attacker-supplied JSON and an unguarded `.includes` returned a 500
from public ingest. `hasPreviewFlag()` exists on both sides (server and
`dom.js`) for exactly this; use it rather than writing the check again.

Ingest and the admin readers must use the SAME predicate. They drifted once: the
ingest short-circuit checked three markers while `isPreviewRecord` checked six,
so a record marked only via `isPreview` / `meta.isPreview` / a `meta.url`
containing `preview=1` was persisted and fanned out to the webhook, the alert
inbox and the autoresponder — then filtered out of the console. A stranger could
inject records the operator could never see. Both sides now call
`isPreviewRecord`.

**Privileged routes are gated structurally.** `PRIVILEGED_PREFIXES` in
`lib/auth.js` is the single definition of what "privileged" means
(`/api/admin/*`, `/api/builder/*`, `/api/ai/*`). The router checks it, runs
`isCrossSiteRequest` then `requireAdmin`, and dispatches `handleBuilder` /
`handleAdmin` / `handleAi` **inside that branch** — so those handlers are
unreachable except through both checks. A new endpoint in one of those modules
is protected by where it lives, not by its author remembering.

This used to be an early `if` with the handlers following it in file order:
correct, but only for as long as nobody added a handler above it. Do not move a
privileged handler out of the branch, do not add a privileged route under a
different prefix, and do not weaken the gate: with `ADMIN_TOKEN` set it requires
a bearer token, and without one it allows only direct loopback callers. A request
carrying `x-forwarded-for` is never treated as loopback — otherwise anyone
reaching a reverse-proxied deployment would inherit localhost's privileges.

A test sweeps every privileged endpoint against both refusal modes (proxied →
401, cross-site → 403) and asserts public ingest is *not* caught by the gate, so
a route that escapes the branch fails CI rather than production.

Loopback trust also validates the `Host` header against `LOOPBACK_HOST_RE` (plus
`ALLOWED_HOSTS`). Without that, DNS rebinding walks straight through every other
gate: a page served from `http://evil.tld:3000`, whose A record the attacker then
flips to `127.0.0.1`, arrives over loopback AND is same-origin with itself — so
the socket check passes, `Sec-Fetch-Site` reads `same-origin`, and being
same-origin the page can read the response. `Host` is the only signal left that
separates the operator's console from a rebound attacker origin.

**Privileged routes also refuse cross-site browser requests.** Authentication is
not enough on its own: with no `ADMIN_TOKEN` the gate trusts loopback, so a page
the operator merely *visits* was able to drive the console. `readJson` ignores
`Content-Type`, so `fetch(…, {mode:"no-cors", headers:{"content-type":
"text/plain"}})` was a CORS *simple* request — no preflight to stop it — that
wrote a funnel document, and a funnel renders on the console's own origin where
`of.adminToken` lives. `isCrossSiteRequest()` now rejects any privileged request
carrying a cross-site `Origin` or `Sec-Fetch-Site`, checked *before*
`requireAdmin`. Two rules follow:

- CORS headers and the `OPTIONS` reply belong only to `PUBLIC_CORS_PATHS`
  (`/api/lead`, `/api/events`, `/api/otp/*`). Answering `OPTIONS` with
  `Allow-Origin: *` for every path green-lit the preflight for privileged
  routes. Do not widen that set.
- A funnel document is operator-authored and the engine trusts it (`form.js`
  renders `step.consent` as HTML). That trust is only sound while the write path
  is not forgeable, so anything that weakens the CSRF check re-opens stored XSS
  on the console origin.

**`x-forwarded-for` is not trusted unless `TRUST_PROXY` is set.** It is a request
header, so honouring it unconditionally made every per-IP limit bypassable by
rotating a string. `clientIp()` returns the socket address by default and warns
once if a forwarded header shows up without the flag. Anything keyed on a client
address inherits this — do not read the header directly.

**Webhook targets are resolved, vetted, and then pinned.** `resolveSafeTarget()`
rejects a hostname whose DNS answer lands on loopback, a private range,
link-local or cloud metadata — and for `http://` it aims the request at the
address it actually vetted, carrying the original `Host` so virtual-host routing
still works. That closes DNS rebinding rather than documenting it: the resolver
cannot answer differently between the check and the socket, because the socket no
longer consults it. `https://` is deliberately left on the hostname — TLS already
defeats the harmful case, since a rebound address cannot present a valid
certificate for the operator's configured name, and overriding SNI would trade a
closed hole for an untestable one. Use `resolveSafeTarget()` for any new outbound
call to an operator-supplied URL; `isSafeWebhookTarget()` alone is the textual
check only.

**Operator-pasted script is opt-in, and never `'unsafe-inline'`.** A funnel's
`customHead` / `customBody` are injected raw, but script inside them is refused
unless `ALLOW_CUSTOM_SCRIPTS=1`. The default is load-bearing: `/f/:slug` is served
from the SAME ORIGIN as the console, and `of.adminToken` lives in that origin's
`localStorage` — so a script on a funnel page reads the token and drains
`/api/admin/*`. Funnel documents are imported from templates and bug reports, so
executing what a document carries turns an import into console takeover.

When enabled, `funnelCsp` allows each inline script by the SHA-256 of its exact
bytes and each external one by its origin (added to `script-src` *and*
`connect-src` — an origin that can load but not beacon is a script that silently
reports nothing). `step.consent` and any future renderer XSS stay blocked,
because their content was never hashed in. Two rules:

- `funnelPage()` and `funnelCsp()` must read the fields through `customCode()`.
  They ran the same `||` chain separately at first; the moment those drift, the
  hash covers different bytes than are served and every pasted script is refused
  with nothing logged.
- With the flag off, a document carrying script logs a warning naming the funnel.
  Do not remove it — the failure was previously invisible server-side, and the
  operator only saw a CSP violation in the *visitor's* console.

**Funnel pages carry a strict CSP.** `script-src` is pinned to the SHA-256 of the
inline boot script, which is why `FUNNEL_BOOT_SCRIPT` must stay free of
interpolation — put a funnel value in it and every funnel page stops running its
own JavaScript, silently, with nothing thrown server-side. A test recomputes the
digest from the served bytes. Third-party script origins are added only for the
pixels a funnel configures, and `frame-ancestors` is deliberately absent because
funnels are embedded and the builder previews them in an iframe.

**Outbound mail is capped by something the caller cannot rotate.** `/api/otp/send`
and the lead autoresponder both mail an address taken from a public request body.
Their per-address and per-IP limits are the everyday guards, but the per-IP key
comes from `clientIp`, which honours caller-supplied `x-forwarded-for` — rotate
it and the ceiling never binds, turning the operator's domain into an open relay.
Both paths therefore also pass a global `MAIL_HOURLY_CAP` (`MAIL_MAX_PER_HOUR`,
default 500). Any new endpoint that sends mail to a caller-supplied address needs
the same absolute ceiling.

**Nothing logs an error object from an outbound `fetch`.** Bun puts the full
request URL on `err.path`, so `console.warn("…", err)` prints whatever the URL
carried — the Meta CAPI `access_token`, a webhook token in the path, an
`SMTP_RELAY_URL` credential. Log `errSummary(err)` (code/message only); a bare
`res.status` is fine.

**Path containment uses `isInside()`, not `startsWith`.** A bare prefix test also
accepts a sibling that shares the root's name (`/apps/app` vs `/apps/app-legacy`).
`isInside()` requires a separator. The WHATWG URL parser resolves literal and
`%2e`-encoded dot segments before routing, but `%2f` survives to
`decodeURIComponent`, so this check is what actually stops traversal.

**Third-party sharing is consent-gated in two independent places.** A funnel opts
in with `consent.enabled` on the funnel document (never a localStorage setting — a
per-browser value can't reach a visitor). Both halves must stay:

- *Client* — `Controller._pixel()` checks `marketingAllowed()` before every
  `firePixel`, so **every** pixel call site must go through `_pixel()`; a direct
  `firePixel` import in new code silently bypasses the gate. The webfont rides the
  same decision via `applyTheme(..., { allowRemote })`, with `loadThemeFont()`
  called from `_grantConsent()` when the visitor accepts.
- *Server* — `forwardMetaCapi` re-derives the gate from the funnel document rather
  than trusting `record.meta.consent`: with `consent.enabled` on, only an explicit
  `"granted"` forwards, so a stripped field is a refusal, not permission. When the
  document can't be resolved it warns and falls back to the client signal —
  deliberately not failing closed, which would disable CAPI for funnels whose `id`
  is not their slug.

Gated: browser pixels, the Meta CAPI forward, Google Fonts. **Not** gated: lead
capture (`/api/lead`) and first-party drop-off events (`/api/events`) — the
visitor typed their details in and pressed submit, so dropping the lead would be
a broken funnel rather than a private one, and those records stay on the
operator's own server. See the header of `src/consent.js`.

**Never trust the client for anything that matters.** Two live examples worth
copying: `email_verified` arrives in the lead payload but is re-derived from
the server's own `verifiedEmails` record before being stored, and the webhook
destination is read only from the environment or the funnel document — never
from the request body, because `/api/lead` is public. Outbound URLs go through
`isSafeWebhookTarget`, which blocks loopback, private ranges and the cloud
metadata address.

**Secrets never travel outward.** `GET /api/admin/email-settings` runs
`redactEmailSettings`, which strips `resendApiKey` / `smtpPass` and replaces
them with `…Set` booleans; writes go through an allowlist (`WRITABLE_EMAIL_KEYS`)
so an unexpected key cannot be persisted, and a blank secret means "keep the
existing value" rather than wiping it. The HTTP relay URL is env-only and never
settable through the API.

**Path traversal.** Any route that reads or writes a file validates against
`SLUG_RE` *and* checks the resolved path still `startsWith` its root dir. Copy
that pattern for any new file-touching route.

**Escaping.** Server-rendered HTML goes through `esc()`; funnel JSON embedded in
a `<script>` goes through `jsonScript()` (which escapes `<`, U+2028, U+2029).
The console has its own `esc()` for the lead inbox. A runtime test asserts a
funnel round-trips through the HTML shell intact.

**Renderers never touch state.** They call the Controller's imperative API
(`answer`, `submitForm`, `advance`, `redirect`, `after`). Use `ctrl.after(ms, fn)`
instead of `setTimeout` so pending callbacks are cancelled on navigation.

**Console fields need a consumer.** The builder will happily persist any key into
`funnel.theme` / `funnel.integrations`, and it will be saved to disk — but it
does nothing until the engine reads it. When adding a field to a settings modal,
wire the consumer in the same change (see the unwired list below).

## Common tasks

**Add a step type:** add the typedef to `src/types.js` and the `Step` union →
create `src/render/<type>.js` → register it in `renderBody()` in
`src/render/index.js` → add the name to `STEP_TYPES` in `apps/app/app.js` so the
builder can create it.

**Add a console view:** add it to `VIEWS` and `ROUTES` in `apps/app/app.js`, add
the path to `APP_ROUTES` in `apps/runtime/server.js` (so a hard refresh on the
URL still serves the shell), and add a `<section id="view-<name>">` to
`apps/app/index.html`.

**Add a pixel:** add the id to the `FunnelIntegrations` typedef in
`src/types.js`, handle it in `installPixels()` / `firePixel()` in
`src/analytics.js` (extend `EVENT_MAP`), then add the input to the Pixels modal
in `apps/app/index.html` and to the `pixelFields` table in `app.js`.

**Add a content block:** add the typedef to `src/types.js` and the `ContentBlock`
union → render it in `renderBlock()` in `src/render/blocks.js` → style it in
`src/styles.css` → add an entry to `BLOCK_SCHEMA` in `apps/app/app.js` so the
section editor can create and edit it → mirror the type into
`packages/engine/types/index.d.ts`.

**Add a funnel:** drop a JSON file in `examples/` — `/api/funnels` lists the
directory, so it appears in the console with no registration step.

**Add a template:** add an entry to `FUNNEL_TEMPLATES` in `apps/app/templates.js`.
Set `category` — the filter pills in `index.html` match on it exactly, and a
template without one only ever appears under "All". Use the field names the
engine actually reads (`ctaLabel`, `submitLabel`, `buttonLabel`/`redirectUrl`);
a `buttonText` key is silently ignored and the button falls back to "Continue".

A template must render with no assets. Both places that shipped an empty `src`
(a hero `media` video, a `gallery` of blank items) drew an empty black player and
three broken image boxes on the operator's first click — the same failure the
file header warns about for hotlinked photography, self-inflicted. Prefer a
gradient, an `faq`, or a `stats` block over an asset placeholder.

The shortlist in the "Create New Funnel" modal is the `BLUEPRINTS` table in
`app.js`, and its `key`s must exist in `FUNNEL_TEMPLATES`. Two of the three used
to name a *category* (`lead-gen`, `fitness`), so `useTemplate()` found nothing and
returned — a dead button with no toast and no console warning. The cards are now
rendered from the table rather than authored in `index.html`, so a card cannot
name a funnel that isn't there, and `useTemplate()` toasts on an unknown key
instead of returning silently. Don't re-hardcode them.

## Style

- JSDoc types throughout, `checkJs: true`, `strict: true`. No `.ts` files in
  runtime code; `packages/engine/types/index.d.ts` is the published surface.
- Every module opens with a `@file` block explaining *why* it exists, not just
  what it does. Section banners (`/* ===== *`) separate concerns in long files.
  Match this density.
- Double quotes, semicolons, 2-space indent.
- Console DOM lookups use `$("id")`; guard with `if ($("x"))` or `?.` since
  modals share one `index.html` and an element may not exist in every build.
  This is load-bearing in `bindInspector()`, because the inspector is tabbed and
  only one tab's markup exists at a time: `insHeadline` / `insSubtext` / `insType`
  / `insId` / `rewriteBtn` are Content, `insNext` / `deleteStepBtn` are Logic.
  Seven of them predated the tabs and were bound unconditionally, so
  `bindInspector` threw on *every* tab. That throw escapes `renderInspector()`
  into `setWorkingFunnel()`, which is how "Use template", "Blank Funnel" and
  opening a funnel all became clicks that did nothing at all — the builder was
  unreachable and nothing was logged where an operator would look. An unguarded
  lookup here does not degrade one field; it takes out the whole builder.

## Known gaps (UI exists, nothing consumes it yet)

The console writes these, but no engine or server code reads them. Treat them as
TODOs, not working features:

- `theme.btnStyle` (`flat` / `glow` / `pressable-3d`) — not read by `theme.js`
  or `styles.css`.
- `integrations.googleAdsId`, `googleAdsLabel`, `linkedinTagId`,
  `pinterestPixelId` — not in the `FunnelIntegrations` typedef and not handled
  by `analytics.js`.
- `of.globalCode`, `of.notifyEmail`, `of.currency`, `of.language`,
  `of.branding.hidden` — stored in localStorage, never read back.
  `of.globalCode` is the one to be careful with: it is described in the UI as
  injected into every published funnel, so wiring it means injecting operator
  HTML into the funnel page. Do that server-side from the funnel document, not
  from a per-browser localStorage value.
  The consent bar used to be in this list as `of.gdpr.enabled`; it now lives on
  the funnel document as `consent.enabled` and is read by `src/consent.js`. That
  move is the pattern to copy for the rest: a visitor-facing setting has to be in
  the funnel JSON, because that is all the funnel page is rendered from.
- `of.ai.brandVoice` and `of.ai.provider` are saved but never sent;
  `generateFunnel()` still posts a stale `of.ai.tone` key that the settings UI
  no longer writes.

### The mirror image: wired in the engine, not reachable from the console

These work in the engine but the builder cannot create them, so they are reachable
only through a template or hand-edited funnel JSON:

- The `select` form field type — `form.js` renders it, but the console has no
  editor for its `options`, so offering it in `FIELD_TYPES` would only ever
  produce an empty dropdown. Add the options editor and the type together.
  (`file` is likewise absent: nothing in the ingest path stores an upload.)

Content blocks used to sit here too — none of them were reachable outside a
template. The section editor in the inspector (`BLOCK_SCHEMA` +
`renderSectionEditor` in `apps/app/app.js`) now covers all 20 block types on
every step type, `calculator` included. `BLOCK_SCHEMA` is the table to extend
when the engine gains a block; its field `key`s are the JSON keys the engine
reads, so they have to track `ContentBlock` in `types.js` or the console writes
a key nothing consumes.

The landing panel and the section editor both address the step by JSON path
(`data-path="blocks.2.items.0.title"`) through `readPath`/`writePath`, rather
than a named `data-*` attribute per field — which is why adding a field is a
line of schema and no wiring. Two consequences worth knowing: text edits
deliberately do **not** re-render the inspector (it is rebuilt from scratch, so
repainting per keystroke would move focus out of the field being typed in), and
`bindInspector` must drop its previous delegated listeners via `_ofUnbind`.
Those listeners live on `#inspector`, which survives the `innerHTML` swap, so
without that every render adds another set and one click on "add section" fires
once per accumulated listener.

## Gotchas

- `theme.font` is applied as `--of-font` **and** fetched from Google Fonts when it
  names a non-system family — which every built-in preset does, so a preset funnel
  hotlinks Google. Only the first comma-separated segment of the stack counts, and
  generic/system/`ui-*`/`-*` families are refused, so a default-themed funnel
  requests nothing. The request is consent-gated: `applyTheme` skips it unless
  `allowRemote`, and `_grantConsent()` loads it on accept. A new preset naming a
  family Google does not host would leak the visitor for a 404 — check it exists.
- `.data/` and `.tmp/` are gitignored. Runtime tests write into `.tmp/`.
- The builder writes into `FUNNELS_DIR` (default `examples/`), so scratch funnels
  created while testing show up as untracked files there. Don't commit them.
- Dev disables the funnel cache (`CACHE_MS = 0`), so editing a JSON and
  reloading just works. Production caches for 60s.
- `/api/ai/generate` only calls OpenAI, and only when the key starts with `sk-`;
  anything else falls through to a hardcoded built-in generator that always
  returns the same 5-step funnel. A "success" response does not mean a model ran.
- Direct SMTP is **not implemented**. `RESEND_API_KEY` or `SMTP_RELAY_URL` are
  the two working transports; setting only `SMTP_*` logs a warning and sends
  nothing. `sendEmail` reports `ok: false` in that case rather than claiming
  success, so don't "fix" a failing send by making it return true.
- Rate limits and the OTP store are in-memory, so they are per-process and
  reset on restart. Behind more than one instance you need an edge rate limit
  and a shared store.
- Supabase and webhook forwarding are opt-in via env; with nothing configured
  everything still works against local JSONL files.
- `apps/builder` and `apps/admin` are the older standalone UIs still mounted at
  `/_builder/*` and `/_admin/*`. New work belongs in `apps/app`.
