# boxBot — Project Principles

## What Is boxBot?
An open-source Claude agent that lives in an elegant wooden box, built on a
Raspberry Pi 5 with the Claude Agent SDK. It sees, hears, remembers, and
communicates — acting as an ambient household assistant that recognizes the
people around it and proactively helps them.

## Core Design Principles

### 1. Security First
All communication with the outside world flows through **structured,
authenticated paths only**:
- **Voice** — direct conversation via microphone and speaker
- **Camera** — passive perception, never streamed or shared externally
- **Button inputs** — physical interaction on the box
- **WhatsApp** — registered users only; unknown numbers are hard blocked
  (silent drop, no response, no information leakage)

There is **no open network listener, no web UI, no SSH-by-default**. The
only open port is the WhatsApp webhook (required by the API).

**User registration** uses single-use, time-limited codes:
- First admin: code displayed on screen during setup (physical presence)
- New users: admin generates code, shares it out-of-band, new user texts
  it to BB. BB never initiates contact with unknown numbers
- See [docs/user-registration.md](docs/user-registration.md) for details

**WhatsApp is a privileged channel, not a proxy.** Email, calendar, RSS,
and other "inbox" services are **skills** running in the sandbox with their
own credentials. BB may relay results via WhatsApp, but data fetching never
touches the messaging path.

### 2. Slim Core, Flexible Extensions
The repository stays focused on the core agent loop, hardware abstraction, and
plugin interfaces. Features are added through three extension systems:
- **Tools** — always-loaded core capabilities (switch display, run script,
  send message, manage memory/tasks)
- **Skills** — modular, optional capabilities the agent can invoke (weather
  lookup, reminders, home control, etc.)
- **Displays** — swappable screen layouts the agent rotates through or selects
  contextually

Tools are the agent's hands — always attached, always available. Skills are
items it picks up — modular, swappable, contributed by the community. Both
use simple base classes. Skills and displays use auto-discovery so
contributors can add them without touching core code.

### 3. Tools, SDK, and Skills

Three layers, each with a different loading strategy and context cost.
The big shift (2026-04): most capability lives in the `bb` Python
package (sandbox SDK), reached through `execute_script`. Only genuinely
hot-path or security-sensitive operations remain as standalone tools.

**Tools** (`src/boxbot/tools/`) — 7 always-loaded tools:
- `execute_script` — primary gateway: run Python in the sandbox with
  the `bb` package (photos, camera, workspace, display, memory, tasks,
  skill, secrets, packages, integrations). Composes many ops per turn.
- `switch_display` — change what's on the 7" screen (hot-path singleton)
- `identify_person` — register / correct a speaker's identity; returns
  a cropped still of the speaker on new-person outcomes so the agent
  can note appearance into memory
- `manage_tasks` — triggers + to-dos (hot-path, every-turn)
- `search_memory` — memory lookup (hot-path, every-turn)
- `web_search` — web fetch + small-model content firewall
- `load_skill` — progressive-disclosure entry point (loads a skill's
  SKILL.md and optional sub-files into context on demand)

Speech and WhatsApp replies flow through the structured output
(`response_text` / `outputs` array) rather than tools — see
`output_dispatcher` and the `tools/registry.py` module docstring.

**SDK** (`src/boxbot/sdk/`, importable as `boxbot_sdk` or just `bb`
inside `execute_script`) — the constrained, immutable Python API:
- `bb.workspace` — filesystem-backed notebook (notes, CSVs, saved
  images). Path-safe, quota-capped, grep-searchable. The "now look it
  up" counterpart to memory's "rings a bell."
- `bb.camera` — `capture` / `capture_cropped` stills; images attach
  straight to the tool result so the agent sees pixels
- `bb.photos` — search, get, view (attaches pixels), show_on_screen
- `bb.display` — declarative block-based display builder + preview
- `bb.memory` — save/search/invalidate (shares backend with tool)
- `bb.tasks` — triggers + to-dos (shares backend with tool)
- `bb.skill` — create new skills at runtime
- `bb.integrations` — list / call / create / update / delete data-pipe
  integrations (sandbox-runnable manifest+script bundles); read
  execution logs for self-debugging. **Calendar lives here**:
  `bb.integrations.get("calendar", action="list_upcoming_events", …)`.
- `bb.secrets` — write-only credential storage
- `bb.packages` — request package install (human approval required)

The SDK communicates with the main process through structured JSON on
stdout + stdin (streaming, bidirectional). `execute_script` reads
action lines line-by-line, dispatches to per-module handlers, writes
JSON replies back to the sandbox, and collects image attachments into
a multimodal tool result. The agent never writes code that runs in the
main process.

**Self-documentation:** the `skills/bb/` skill is the agent's map to
the `bb` package. Its `SKILL.md` is injected into the system prompt at
Level 1 (metadata) and loaded at Level 2 (module index) on demand;
per-module docs (`skills/bb/modules/*.md`) load at Level 3 as needed.

**Skills** (`src/boxbot/skills/` + `skills/`) — modular capabilities
loaded per-conversation based on relevance:
- Declares name, description, and parameter schema
- Can be built-in, user-installed, or agent-created (via SDK)
- Skill logic runs as sandboxed Python scripts
- Only relevant skills are injected, conserving context

### 4. Sandbox & Agent Authoring
The agent operates through a **sandbox** — a separate venv (default
`/var/lib/boxbot-sandbox/venv`, override via ``sandbox.runtime_dir`` in
config) isolated from the main application. The sandbox lives outside
the project tree on purpose: this is open-source, and the
``boxbot-sandbox`` system user can't traverse a 0700 home directory
just to reach the venv. Sandbox security is enforced at the **OS
level** (not Python level):
- Scripts run as `boxbot-sandbox` user with minimal filesystem permissions
- **seccomp** blocks `execve`/`fork` — no subprocess spawning of any kind
- `.env` is mode `0600` owned by `boxbot` — sandbox cannot read secrets
- `site-packages` is read-only — sandbox cannot install packages
- The agent can only interact with boxBot through the **immutable SDK**
- The SDK is **declarative for displays**: building blocks only, no raw
  render code. Main process generates validated display classes
- Agent-created **skills auto-activate** (their logic runs sandboxed)
- Agent-created **displays auto-activate** — saved spec is registered
  with the live display manager and immediately switchable. The render
  spec is declarative (block tree only, no executable code), so there
  is no privileged code path to gate
- **Package installation requires out-of-band human approval** — physical
  screen tap or WhatsApp reply from admin. The sandbox can only emit
  requests; there is no way to spoof approval
- See [docs/sandbox.md](docs/sandbox.md) for full details

### 5. Two-Model Architecture
boxBot uses two Claude models to balance capability and cost:
- **Large model** (`BOXBOT_MODEL_LARGE`) — conversations, reasoning, memory
  extraction, skill/display authoring, complex decision-making
- **Small model** (`BOXBOT_MODEL_SMALL`) — photo tagging, intent
  classification, structured data extraction, wake-word transcript filtering,
  web search filtering (content firewall), routine pre-processing that feeds
  into the large model's context

The small model handles high-frequency, low-stakes tasks. The large model
handles everything that requires judgment or creativity.

### 6. Memory-Driven Continuity
Three stores give the agent persistent knowledge:
- **System memory** — always-loaded household facts and standing instructions
  (`data/memory/system.md`, ~2-4 KB, auto-updated with guardrails)
- **Fact memories** — typed (person, household, methodology, operational),
  extracted from conversations, searchable via hybrid vector + keyword
  retrieval with small-model reranking
- **Conversation log** — ultra-compact summaries of every conversation,
  rolling 2-month window

Memories are **contextually injected** at conversation start based on who
is speaking and what they said. The `search_memory` tool provides three
modes: `lookup` (ranked results), `summary` (synthesized answers), and
`get` (full record by ID). **Access-based retention** keeps useful memories
alive and lets unused ones fade.

Alongside memory there is the **agent workspace** (`data/workspace/`,
exposed as `bb.workspace`) — a filesystem-backed notebook the agent
owns. Memory = "rings a bell" (recognize that something is relevant);
workspace = "now look it up" (read the detail from a file). A 40-item
Pokémon list lives in `workspace/notes/people/erik/pokemon.md`; memory
just knows the file exists. This separation keeps memory retrieval
sharp (no giant records, no tiny records diluting search) and gives
the agent a real persistent scratch space for notes, CSVs that drive
displays, drafts, and images it captured or saved.

See [docs/memory.md](docs/memory.md) for the memory design and
[skills/bb/modules/workspace.md](skills/bb/modules/workspace.md) for
the workspace API.

The agent should feel like it *knows* you, not like every conversation starts
from zero.

### 7. Multimodal Person Identification
The agent recognizes household members through fused visual and audio signals:
- **Visual ReID** — appearance embeddings clustered per person, run on Hailo
- **Speaker diarization** — voice embeddings for persistent speaker identity
- **Fusion** — audio confirms visual identity; voice teaches the visual system
  new appearances over time

This enables contextual awareness: the agent knows *who* it's talking to and
can act on person-specific tasks (e.g., relay a message from one family member
to another when they walk by).

### 8. Triggers, To-Do List, and Wake Cycle
The agent has a trigger-driven wake/sleep lifecycle and a persistent
to-do list:
- **Triggers** — event-driven wake conditions with AND logic. Types:
  point-in-time (`fire_at`), timer (`fire_after`, max 24h), recurring
  (`cron`), and person detection (`person`). Compound triggers combine
  conditions: "after 30 minutes, remind Jacob when you see him" =
  `fire_after` + `person`, both must be met
- **To-do list** — persistent action items the agent tracks. Lightweight
  list (descriptions only) with detailed notes loaded on demand. Reviewed
  during wake cycles and available during conversations
- **Wake cycle** — configurable recurring triggers (seeded from config)
  that wake the agent to check the to-do list, update displays, and
  act on pending items. Config seeds on first boot; agent can modify
  at runtime
- **Sleep state** — when idle, boxBot shows idle displays and listens
  only for wake words and person detection events
- **Conversation injection** — `[To-do: N items | Triggers: N active]`
  injected at conversation start so the agent can decide whether to
  consult its task list

### 9. Privacy by Design
- All person identification runs **on-device** (Hailo NPU + CPU)
- Photos and embeddings are stored **locally** (optional encrypted cloud backup)
- No telemetry, no data leaves the box except explicit API calls (Claude,
  WhatsApp, weather, etc.)
- Camera frames are processed and discarded — never stored unless the user
  explicitly saves a photo

### 10. One Conversation Abstraction
The agent sees text, not voice. Voice and WhatsApp are **I/O adapters**
that produce attributed transcripts and deliver outputs; the agent
processes conversations independent of transport.

- **`Conversation`** (`src/boxbot/core/conversation.py`) owns the full
  lifecycle of one logical interaction: its thread of messages, its
  participants, the I/O channels it covers, the in-flight generation
  task, and its state (`LISTENING` / `THINKING` / `SPEAKING` / `ENDED`).
- **Per-conversation serialization, cross-conversation parallelism.**
  One generation runs at a time within a conversation, but a voice
  conversation in the room runs fully in parallel with a WhatsApp
  conversation with a different person. No global conversation lock.
- **New input cancels in-flight generation.** If a user speaks while
  the agent is thinking or mid-TTS, the current generation is
  cancelled, partial delivery is folded into the thread as an
  interrupted assistant turn, and a fresh generation starts with the
  updated thread. The model sees what was actually delivered and
  decides what to do next.
- **Silence timeout lives on the conversation**, not the voice
  transport. The voice adapter is a thin layer: wake word activates
  mic capture, a `ConversationEnded(channel="voice")` event
  deactivates it. LEDs are a pure function of the voice-room
  conversation's state — no independent timers drift from the
  conversation's reality.
- **Per-channel lifecycle.** Voice and trigger conversations are
  *transient*: in-memory thread, silence timer ends them, extraction
  fires synchronously on `ConversationEnded`. WhatsApp conversations
  are *persistent*: every turn writes through the
  `ConversationStore` (SQLite at `data/conversations/`), no silence
  timer, a rolling-window cutoff (default 4 hours of inactivity)
  decides when the thread closes. Threads survive process restart;
  on `agent.start()` any active WhatsApp threads are warm-loaded so
  a deploy mid-chat resumes mid-thread. A background sweep (every 5
  min) marks expired threads `extracted` and queues memory
  extraction over the full thread. The cutoff is the feature, not a
  bug — async-by-default text shouldn't fragment into 3-minute
  silence-timeouts. See `boxbot.whatsapp.thread_window_seconds`.
- **Conversation keys:** `voice:room` (one per physical room),
  `whatsapp:<phone>` (per sender), `trigger:<id>:<uuid>` (one-shot
  per firing).

## Development Guidelines

### Python
- Use `python3` explicitly — this system does not have `python` on PATH
- Target Python 3.11+ (Raspberry Pi OS Bookworm default)
- Use `pyproject.toml` for project metadata and dependencies
- Type hints on all public interfaces

### Code Style
- Keep modules small and focused — one responsibility per file
- Hardware access goes through the HAL, never direct GPIO/I2C in business logic
- All configuration via YAML files, never hardcoded
- Secrets (API keys, WhatsApp tokens) go in `.env`, never committed

### Testing
- Unit tests mock hardware; integration tests run on-device
- Skills and displays must include at least one test

### Contributing
- New skills go in `skills/` as standalone packages
- New displays go in `displays/` as standalone packages
- Core changes require discussion in an issue first

## Deploying to the Pi

There is **one deploy path**: `scripts/deploy.sh`. No alternatives, no
escape hatches. The Pi mirrors `origin/main` exactly — `git rev-parse
HEAD` on the Pi always answers "what is running here."

```bash
# From the dev machine, after committing your work:
./scripts/deploy.sh                     # uses $BOXBOT_DEPLOY_TARGET
./scripts/deploy.sh user@host           # explicit override
```

Set the target once. Three options, checked in this order by
`deploy.sh`:

1. **Shell init** (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, or a gitignored `.envrc`):
   ```bash
   export BOXBOT_DEPLOY_TARGET=user@host
   ```
2. **Project `.env`** (gitignored, mode 0600 — same file as runtime
   secrets):
   ```
   BOXBOT_DEPLOY_TARGET=user@host
   ```
3. **Positional arg** (one-off override): `./scripts/deploy.sh user@host`

The fallback when none are set is `pi@boxbot.local` (mDNS — works on
most LANs running Avahi/Bonjour).
If your Pi checkout lives somewhere other than `software/boxBot`,
override with `BOXBOT_PI_PROJECT_DIR`.

What it does, in order:

1. **Pre-flight**: refuses to deploy unless the working tree is clean,
   you're on `main`, and `main` isn't behind `origin/main`. Everything
   that runs on the Pi must be reproducible from a git SHA.
2. **`git push origin main`** — no-op if already pushed.
3. **SSH to Pi → `git fetch && git pull --ff-only origin main`** —
   fast-forward only. The Pi can never silently diverge.
4. **Warns** if `scripts/setup-sandbox.sh` changed in this deploy. The
   operator runs `sudo bash scripts/setup-sandbox.sh` manually after
   the deploy because it needs sudo and may want attention.
5. **`scripts/restart-boxbot.sh` on the Pi** — SIGTERMs the running
   boxbot, waits up to 15s for clean exit, SIGKILLs if needed, then
   spawns a fresh one with a new dated log under `logs/`.
6. **Tails the startup log** so you see whether it came up cleanly.

If any step fails, the script exits non-zero and the Pi is left in a
recoverable state (last good commit + still-running old boxbot until
restart actually fires).

### What if I want to test something before committing?

Don't deploy it. Test in dev, or commit to a throwaway branch and
deploy that branch to a non-prod target. The Pi is the live device —
it should never run uncommitted code.

### Pi-only state that is never deployed

The deploy never touches these — they live only on the Pi:

- `.env` (API keys, secrets) — gitignored, mode 0600.
- `config/config.yaml`, `config/whatsapp.yaml` — gitignored runtime
  config. Templates `*.example.yaml` are in git for reference. To
  change runtime config, SSH in and edit on the Pi directly.
- `data/**` — memory DB, perception DB, photos, workspace, scheduler
  DB, credentials. All Pi-local.
- `logs/**` — runtime logs.

### One-time Pi reconcile (only if needed)

If the Pi's local git ever ends up out of sync with `origin/main` (e.g.
historical rsync deploys before this SOP), reconcile once:

```bash
ssh "$BOXBOT_DEPLOY_TARGET" 'cd software/boxBot && git fetch origin && git reset --hard origin/main'
```

Safe because `data/`, `.env`, `logs/`, `config/config.yaml` are all
gitignored and untouched by `git reset`.
