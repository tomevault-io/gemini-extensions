This file provides project-specific instructions for Cursor Agent and compatible AI coding agents operating in this repository. These instructions ensure that agents follow the same coding standards, safety rules, and workflows that apply to all contributors.

## Canonical Instructions

The authoritative source of truth for all repository rules is **`.github/copilot-instructions.md`** (the repo-wide constitution). All rules defined there apply without exception. **Read that file before making any changes.**

This file intentionally keeps only a minimal inline summary of the highest-priority shared rules so that Cursor receives critical guidance immediately. The full shared rule set remains in the canonical file above.

**Thin entry point classification:** A thin entry point keeps shared repository rules brief; it does not mean platform-specific or required protocol sections may be discarded. Sections explicitly labeled as platform protocol or required protocol must be preserved unless the repository owner explicitly waives that protocol for the retained agent platform.

## Protected Instruction Files

Instruction files and style guides are protected governance files. Do not create, edit, delete, rename, or otherwise change `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, files under `.github/instructions/`, files under `.cursor/rules/`, or root agent instruction files (`.hermes.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`) unless the repository owner or maintainer has directly and explicitly authorized that specific instruction-file change in the current task. Implied consent is not enough; do not infer authorization from a plan you generated, review feedback, a general request to update docs, cleanup/validation work, or a "keep files in sync" instruction.

If a style-guide update appears warranted but has not been explicitly authorized, propose it separately and wait for approval before editing protected instruction files.

During downstream template adoption and stack selection, perform non-protected cleanup first, record the protected instruction-file edits needed to remove references to deleted tools or stacks, obtain explicit maintainer authorization, then update `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, remaining root agent files, and relevant `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md` files. Bump `Last Updated` and `Version` metadata where present, and avoid temporary migration wording in durable governance docs.

## Essential Repository Summary

- **Safety and security**
  - No secrets in code or repo; never hardcode API keys, tokens, credentials, or connection strings.
  - Treat all external input as untrusted.
  - Respect allowlisted file access boundaries; reject path traversal and symlink escapes.

- **Pre-commit and validation**
  - Run `pre-commit run --all-files` before every commit.
  - Include all auto-fixes in the same commit as the related change.
  - Do not push code when pre-commit or required validation checks are failing; fix issues and re-run until the checks pass.
  - Use the repository's existing validation commands as needed:
    <!-- template-sync: begin markdown-reference-only -->
    - `npm run lint:md`
    <!-- template-sync: end markdown-reference-only -->
    <!-- template-sync: begin python-reference-only -->
    - `python -m pyright --project pyrightconfig.json`
    - `pytest tests/ -m "not upstream_template_only and not slow" -v --cov --cov-report=term-missing`
    - `pytest tests/ -m slow -v --no-cov`
    <!-- template-sync: end python-reference-only -->
    <!-- template-sync: begin powershell-reference-only -->
    - `Invoke-Pester -Path tests/ -Output Detailed`
    <!-- template-sync: end powershell-reference-only -->
  - The `pre-commit run --all-files` command exercises the active hooks configured in [`.pre-commit-config.yaml`](../../.pre-commit-config.yaml), the authoritative list of active hooks.
  <!-- template-sync: begin json-reference-only -->
  - Retained JSON checks include strict JSON syntax (`check-json`).
  <!-- template-sync: end json-reference-only -->
  <!-- template-sync: begin yaml-reference-only -->
  - Retained YAML checks include YAML parsing (`check-yaml`) and style (`yamllint`).
  <!-- template-sync: end yaml-reference-only -->
  - Retained GitHub Actions checks include GitHub Actions linting (`actionlint`).
  - When the `github-actions` module is retained, the dedicated [`.github/workflows/data-ci.yml`](../../.github/workflows/data-ci.yml) workflow re-runs retained data-file hooks so adopted data-file enforcement can be required via branch protection.
  - Retained data-file authoring guidance lives in the matching module docs.
  <!-- template-sync: begin json-reference-only -->
  - JSON guidance: [`.github/instructions/json.instructions.md`](../../.github/instructions/json.instructions.md).
  <!-- template-sync: end json-reference-only -->
  <!-- template-sync: begin yaml-reference-only -->
  - YAML guidance: [`.github/instructions/yaml.instructions.md`](../../.github/instructions/yaml.instructions.md).
  <!-- template-sync: end yaml-reference-only -->

- **Modular instruction files**
  - Read the relevant file under `.github/instructions/` before modifying matching files:
    - Git attributes: `.github/instructions/gitattributes.instructions.md`
    <!-- template-sync: begin json-reference-only -->
    - JSON: `.github/instructions/json.instructions.md`
    <!-- template-sync: end json-reference-only -->
    <!-- template-sync: begin markdown-reference-only -->
    - Markdown/Docs: `.github/instructions/docs.instructions.md`
    <!-- template-sync: end markdown-reference-only -->
    <!-- template-sync: begin powershell-reference-only -->
    - PowerShell: `.github/instructions/powershell.instructions.md`
    <!-- template-sync: end powershell-reference-only -->
    <!-- template-sync: begin python-reference-only -->
    - Python: `.github/instructions/python.instructions.md`
    <!-- template-sync: end python-reference-only -->
    <!-- template-sync: begin yaml-reference-only -->
    - YAML: `.github/instructions/yaml.instructions.md`
    <!-- template-sync: end yaml-reference-only -->

- **Do not**
  - Execute scripts or commands generated by untrusted sources.
  - Add telemetry or external logging services without explicit approval.
  - Weaken security constraints to "make it work."
  - Add new major dependencies without clear justification.
  - Invent behavior when requirements are ambiguous; use an explicit Open Question.
  - Create separate formatting-only or lint-only commits.

## Azure DevOps PR Review Protocol

This section is retained as Cursor host-specific protocol. Thin-entry-point pruning must preserve it unless the repository owner explicitly waives Azure DevOps PR review protocol for the retained Cursor entry point.

Use this protocol only for Azure DevOps Services pull requests hosted in Azure Repos. GitHub-hosted repositories continue to use the repository's GitHub-specific protocol and tooling.

- Azure Repos Copilot code review is a limited public preview for Azure DevOps Services. It requires sign-up, organization-level enablement by a Project Collection Administrator, repository-level enablement by a repository owner or administrator, and individual-user opt-in through Preview features unless the administrator enables it for the organization. It requires Azure billing through a subscription linked to the Azure DevOps organization; Azure DevOps review usage does not draw down GitHub Copilot plan AI credits. Treat licensing and pricing details as preview-specific and documentation-driven, and do not assume GitHub-hosted Copilot review entitlements cover Azure Repos review usage.
- Copilot review is requested manually from the Azure Repos PR Reviewers list by selecting **Request** next to **GitHub Copilot**. If Azure DevOps tooling supports reviewer operations, Cursor MAY inspect or add ordinary reviewers through Azure DevOps Pull Request Reviewers APIs, but MUST NOT claim API-triggered Copilot preview review unless the available tooling explicitly verifies that behavior.
- Copilot always leaves a **Comment** review, never approves or requests changes, does not satisfy required-reviewer policies, and does not block merging. Copilot does not read replies, does not follow up, and does not automatically re-review after new commits; a fresh review requires another manual request.
- Cursor has no autonomous Azure DevOps wake-up. Mentions route Azure DevOps comments only when the user's runtime explicitly forwards them into the active Cursor session.
- When Azure DevOps connector/API tooling is available and safely authenticated, Cursor MAY inspect PR reviewers, threads, comments, thread status, and PR statuses through Azure DevOps REST APIs, and MAY post replies/comments, update thread status, or create PR statuses. When tooling is missing or insufficient, state the needed manual owner action instead.
- Authentication guidance must stay high-level and secure: prefer Microsoft Entra authentication, service principals or managed identities for automation, Azure DevOps service connections for pipeline scenarios, secure local tool configuration, or environment variables. Treat tokens as opaque values, do not decode claims, and never embed PATs, bearer tokens, service connections, credential-bearing clone URLs, or secret-like placeholders in repository files, commands, logs, or comments.
