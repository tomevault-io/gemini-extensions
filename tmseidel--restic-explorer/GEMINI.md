# Agent Instructions

## Language & Frameworks

### Java
- **Always use the latest LTS version of Java** and leverage the newest language features available (e.g., records, sealed classes, pattern matching, virtual threads, string templates).
- **Lombok is mandatory.** Use Lombok annotations to reduce boilerplate:
    - `@Data`, `@Value`, `@Builder`, `@AllArgsConstructor`, `@NoArgsConstructor`, `@Slf4j`, `@RequiredArgsConstructor`, etc.
    - Never write getters, setters, `toString()`, `equals()`, or `hashCode()` manually when Lombok can generate them.
- When using **Spring**, always use **Spring Boot 4** (Spring Framework 7). Do not use older versions.
    - Prefer constructor injection (via `@RequiredArgsConstructor`) over field injection.
    - Use `application.yml` over `application.properties`.

## Architecture & Code Organization

### Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

- **Always apply Domain-Driven Design principles** when organizing code into Java classes and packages.
- Structure the codebase around **bounded contexts** and **domain modules**, not technical layers.
- Preferred package structure per domain/module:

  ```
  com.example.project
  ├── order/                        # Bounded context: Order
  │   ├── domain/
  │   │   ├── model/                # Entities, Value Objects, Aggregates
  │   │   ├── event/                # Domain Events
  │   │   ├── repository/           # Repository interfaces (ports)
  │   │   └── service/              # Domain services (pure business logic)
  │   ├── application/              # Application services / use cases
  │   ├── infrastructure/
  │   │   ├── persistence/          # Repository implementations (adapters)
  │   │   ├── messaging/            # Event publishers, message consumers
  │   │   └── client/               # External service clients
  │   └── api/                      # REST controllers, DTOs, mappers
  │       ├── dto/
  │       └── mapper/
  ├── customer/                     # Bounded context: Customer
  │   ├── domain/
  │   ├── application/
  │   ├── infrastructure/
  │   └── api/
  └── shared/                       # Shared kernel (cross-cutting concerns)
      ├── domain/
      └── infrastructure/
  ```

- **Entities** must have a clear identity and lifecycle. Use JPA `@Entity` with Lombok `@Data` or `@Getter`/`@Setter`.
- **Value Objects** must be immutable. Use Java `record` types or Lombok `@Value`.
- **Aggregates** must enforce consistency boundaries. Only the aggregate root should be accessible from outside the aggregate.
- **Domain Services** contain business logic that doesn't naturally belong to a single entity.
- **Application Services** orchestrate use cases by coordinating domain objects and infrastructure.
- **Repository interfaces** belong in the domain layer; their implementations belong in infrastructure.
- Keep the domain layer **free of framework dependencies** (no Spring annotations, no JPA in model classes if possible — use mapping in the infrastructure layer).

### Consistency with Existing Patterns

- **When creating new functionalities, always analyze and follow the existing package-naming conventions and class-organization patterns** already present in the codebase.
- Before creating new packages or classes:
    1. Review how existing features are structured.
    2. Mirror the same naming conventions (e.g., `*Service`, `*Repository`, `*Controller`, `*Dto`, `*Mapper`).
    3. Place new classes in the same relative locations as their existing counterparts.
    4. Follow the same layering approach already established.
- **Never introduce a new organizational pattern** unless the existing one is explicitly being refactored. Consistency across the codebase takes priority.
- If the codebase does not yet follow DDD, propose a migration path in the documentation rather than mixing paradigms.

## Security

- **Sensitive data must always be encrypted.** Never store secrets, passwords, API keys, or tokens in plain text.
    - Use environment variables or a secrets manager (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) for runtime secrets.
    - In Spring, use `jasypt-spring-boot` or Spring Cloud Vault for encrypted properties.
    - Database credentials, JWT secrets, and API keys must never appear in source code or configuration files committed to the repository.
- Always apply input validation and sanitization.
- Use parameterized queries or JPA/Hibernate — never concatenate SQL strings.
- Enable CSRF protection and CORS policies where applicable.
- Use HTTPS for all external communication.
- Apply the principle of least privilege for all service accounts and database users.

## Deployment & Containerization

- **All artifacts must be containerized with Docker.**
    - Every deployable service must include a `Dockerfile`.
    - Use multi-stage builds to keep images small and secure.
    - Base images should be minimal (e.g., `eclipse-temurin:<version>-jre-alpine`).
    - Never run containers as root — always define a non-root `USER` in the Dockerfile.
    - Use `.dockerignore` to exclude unnecessary files.

### Example Dockerfile

```dockerfile
# Build stage
FROM eclipse-temurin:23-jdk-alpine AS build
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN ./mvnw clean package -DskipTests

# Runtime stage
FROM eclipse-temurin:23-jre-alpine
WORKDIR /app
RUN addgroup -S appgroup && adduser -S appuser -G appgroup
COPY --from=build /app/target/*.jar app.jar
USER appuser
EXPOSE 8080
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]
```

## CI/CD — GitHub Actions

**Two workflows must always be present:**

### 1. PR Build & Test (`ci.yml`)

Triggered when a pull request targets `develop` or `main`. Must:
- Compile the project.
- Run all unit and integration tests.
- Perform a lint/style check if configured.

```yaml
name: CI — Build & Test

on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main
      - develop

jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up JDK
        uses: actions/setup-java@v4
        with:
          distribution: temurin
          java-version: '23'
          cache: maven

      - name: Build & Test
        run: ./mvnw clean verify
```

### 2. Push to Docker Hub (`release.yml`)

Triggered on push to `main`. Must:
- Build the Docker image.
- Push it to Docker Hub with appropriate tags (`latest` + version).

```yaml
name: Release — Push to Docker Hub

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  docker-publish:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Docker Buildx
        uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v3

      - name: Log in to Docker Hub
        uses: docker/login-action@v3
        with:
          username: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_TOKEN }}

      - name: Extract version
        id: version
        run: echo "VERSION=$(./mvnw help:evaluate -Dexpression=project.version -q -DforceStdout)" >> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"

      - name: Build and push
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v6
        with:
          context: .
          push: true
          tags: |
            ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}/${{ github.event.repository.name }}:latest
            ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}/${{ github.event.repository.name }}:${{ steps.version.outputs.VERSION }}
```

## Documentation

- **Documentation must be updated on any significant change**, including but not limited to:
    - New features or removal of existing features.
    - Architectural changes (new modules, service splits, changed communication patterns).
    - Changes to public APIs (REST endpoints, message contracts).
    - Changes to deployment or infrastructure configuration.
    - New environment variables or configuration properties.
- Maintain a `docs/` directory for architectural and feature documentation.
- The `README.md` must always reflect the current state of:
    - How to build and run the project locally.
    - How to run tests.
    - How to build and run the Docker image.
    - Environment variables and configuration.
- Use **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)** in `docs/adr/` for significant architectural decisions.
- Add or update Javadoc on all public classes and methods.

## Code Style & Conventions

- Follow standard Java naming conventions.
- Prefer immutability: use `final` fields, records, and `@Value` (Lombok) where possible.
- Use `Optional` instead of returning `null`.
- Write unit tests for all business logic (JUnit 5 + Mockito).
- Maintain a minimum of 80% test coverage on new code.
- Use SLF4J (via Lombok `@Slf4j`) for logging — never `System.out.println`.

## Dependencies & Build

- Use **Maven** with the Maven Wrapper (`mvnw`) committed to the repository.
- Keep dependencies up to date; prefer managed BOMs (e.g., Spring Boot BOM).
- Pin dependency versions explicitly — no snapshot dependencies in `main`.
