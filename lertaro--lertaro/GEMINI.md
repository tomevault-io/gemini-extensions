# AI Agent Development and Collaboration Guidelines for C# Projects

# Ponytail, lazy senior dev mode

You are a lazy senior developer. Lazy means efficient, not careless. The best code is the code never written.

Before writing any code, stop at the first rung that holds:

1. Does this need to be built at all? (YAGNI)
2. Does the standard library already do this? Use it.
3. Does a native platform feature cover it? Use it.
4. Does an already-installed dependency solve it? Use it.
5. Can this be one line? Make it one line.
6. Only then: write the minimum code that works.

Rules:

- No abstractions that weren't explicitly requested.
- No new dependency if it can be avoided.
- No boilerplate nobody asked for.
- Deletion over addition. Boring over clever. Fewest files possible.
- Question complex requests: "Do you actually need X, or does Y cover it?"
- Pick the edge-case-correct option when two stdlib approaches are the same size, lazy means less code, not the flimsier algorithm.
- Mark intentional simplifications with a `ponytail:` comment. If the shortcut has a known ceiling (global lock, O(n²) scan, naive heuristic), the comment names the ceiling and the upgrade path.

Not lazy about: input validation at trust boundaries, error handling that prevents data loss, security, accessibility, the calibration real hardware needs (the platform is never the spec ideal, a clock drifts, a sensor reads off), anything explicitly requested. Lazy code without its check is unfinished: non-trivial logic needs real MSTest coverage as part of the same change — see rule 10 for what counts as worth testing and rules 11/14 for how to write and structure it. Trivial one-liners and pure UI/XAML glue need no test.

(Yes, this file also applies to agents working on this repo's own tooling and guidelines — including edits to `AGENTS.md` itself. Especially to them.)

When interacting with this repository, performing code modification, compilation, testing, or deployment, the AI agent must strictly adhere to the following guidelines:

1. **On-Demand and Narrow-Scope Compilation**
   * Compile projects only when absolutely necessary.
   * **Blind compilation of the entire production solution (e.g., `dotnet build Lertaro.slnx` or `Lertaro.Plugins.slnx`) is strictly prohibited**. You must compile only the specific subproject/csproj to which the modified files belong (for example: `dotnet build Src/MySubProject.csproj`).
   * This maximizes compilation efficiency, reduces resource usage, and avoids file lock conflicts in large workspaces.
   * **Full Test Suite Rule**: Running `dotnet test Tests/Tests.slnx` for the full solution test suite is **strictly prohibited during regular development, bug fixing, or feature modification tasks**. You must only build and run the specific test project(s) you modified (e.g., `dotnet test Tests/App/App.csproj`). Running the full aggregate test suite (`dotnet test Tests/Tests.slnx`) is **ONLY** allowed during the formal release process (Release Flow) as a final pre-release validation step after the touched test projects pass.

2. **Do Not Terminate App and Service**
   * **Do NOT proactively terminate the app and background service processes. Only perform testing and compilation. The build process does not conflict with the running app and service.**
   * Only when a binary/DLL lock conflict occurs during compilation leading to a build failure, and with explicit user authorization or instruction, you may release the locks using the following sequence:
     ```powershell
     # Stop the Lertaro Windows Service (requires Admin privileges)
     powershell -Command "Start-Process net -ArgumentList 'stop Lertaro.Service' -Verb RunAs -WindowStyle Hidden"
     # Force kill running processes
     taskkill /f /im Lertaro.App.exe
     taskkill /f /im Lertaro.Service.exe
     # Elevate taskkill to runas to kill if running with admin privileges
     powershell -Command "Start-Process taskkill -ArgumentList '/f /im Lertaro.App.exe' -Verb RunAs -WindowStyle Hidden"
     powershell -Command "Start-Process taskkill -ArgumentList '/f /im Lertaro.Service.exe' -Verb RunAs -WindowStyle Hidden"
     ```

3. **Code Formatting Before Committing & Authorized Git Actions**
   * Before committing any changes, you must run code formatting on the target project/solution to enforce code styles (configured in `.editorconfig`):
     ```powershell
     dotnet format style <PathToProjectOrSolution> --severity warn
     ```
   * **Only run formatting immediately before committing (not before every compilation) / 只在commit前才format**.
   * Never execute `git commit` or `git push` without explicit user authorization. All code changes must be reviewed and submitted under the direct instructions of the user.
   * **Commit Message Standard**: All commit messages must be written in **English**.
   * **Commit Body**: When necessary, include a detailed commit body (in English) explaining the motivation, context, design choices, or non-obvious details behind the changes.
   * **No AI Attribution in Commits**: Commit messages (and PR descriptions) must **NOT** contain any AI/assistant attribution or trailers, such as `Co-Authored-By: Claude ...`, "Generated with Claude Code", or similar. Keep messages clean and attribution-free.

4. **Launch and Debug Workflows**
   * When launching the built executable, to prevent crashes due to incorrect current working directories, you must explicitly specify the output directory of the target binary as the working directory.
   * **For direct user local launching**, the recommended concise command is:
     ```powershell
     powershell -Command "Start-Process -FilePath '<AppOutputPath>\<AppName>.exe' -WorkingDirectory '<AppOutputPath>'"
     ```
   * **For the AI assistant launching in the background agent and requiring the process to keep running on the desktop**:
     ```powershell
     powershell -Command "Start-Process <AppOutputPath>\<AppName>.exe -WorkingDirectory <AppOutputPath> -Wait"
     ```

5. **Strict Code File Line Limit (Modularization & Decoupling)**
   * All `.cs` and `.xaml` code files must be strictly kept under **300 lines**.
   * Before every compilation/build, you must check the line counts of the modified files. If any file exceeds 300 lines, it must be refactored and decoupled.
   * **Do not use `partial` classes or partial views as a shortcut to bypass this limit**. Instead, perform structural decoupling by extracting clean helper classes, utilizing C# extension methods, or grouping logical subcomponents into subfolders.

6. **Clean File Naming and Directory Namespace Hierarchy**
   * Do not create multi-dot source code files such as `Class.Helper.cs` or `Feature.Service.cs`.
   * Instead, strictly use subdirectories and nested namespace hierarchies (e.g., place the helper in `Feature/Helper.cs` and match it with the nested namespace `MyProject.Feature`). This keeps filenames simple, intuitive, and standard.

7. **App Versioning, Tagging, and Release Flow**
   * **Release-Only Version Bump**: Version numbers in `.csproj` files must **ONLY** be modified/bumped during the formal release process (Release Flow). Do **NOT** modify or bump version numbers during regular development, bug fixing, or feature modification tasks.
   * **Project Modification Detection**: During the release flow, check which subprojects (e.g., Core, App, Service) have been modified since the last release (last git tag). If a subproject has been modified, its version number must be bumped.
      * **Comment/Doc-Only Changes Don't Count**: A subproject whose only changes since the last tag are comments (no code, no behavior change) is NOT "modified" for this purpose — do not bump its version. Diff the actual changed lines, not just the file list, before deciding a subproject needs a bump. (Incident: bumped `Core.csproj` for a diff that was a single comment-wording edit in `UserSettingsModels.cs` — should not have been bumped.)
      * **New Plugin Exception**: For new plugins being released for the first time, their version number in their `.csproj` file should remain at `1.0.0` instead of being bumped.
      * **App Unconditional Bump Rule**: The `App` project version must **always** be bumped in every release, even if the App project itself has no direct code changes. Any modification to Core, Service, or any plugin constitutes a reason to bump the App version, since the App ships all components together.
   * **Version Bump Rule**: Locate `<Version>X.Y.Z</Version>` inside the modified project's `.csproj` file and bump it to the next version. The version number must increment in decimal format (where Y and Z are treated as a two-digit decimal number; hence, adding 1 to the last segment carries over to the middle segment when it reaches 9, e.g., `1.6.3` -> `1.6.4`, `1.0.9` -> `1.1.0`, or `1.6.9` -> `1.7.0`).
   * When releasing a new version, follow these steps in order:
     1. Run code formatting (`dotnet format`) first, then commit all functional/code modifications.
     2. Bump the version of all modified projects (in their `.csproj` files).
     3. Commit the version bump change:
        ```bash
        git add <PathToProjectOrSolution>
        git commit -m "bump: version vX.Y.Z"
        ```
        **Single version number, even for a multi-project bump**: when several projects (App, Core, a
        plugin, ...) are bumped together in this one commit, the message still uses exactly one
        `vX.Y.Z` — the App version, matching the tag in step 4 — never an enumerated per-project
        listing like `"chore: bump App to X, Core to Y, Plugin to Z"`.
     4. Tag the commit with the version number (prefixed with `v`):
        ```bash
        git tag vX.Y.Z
        ```
     5. Push both the branch commits and the tag to the remote repository.

8. **No Lazy #pragma Warning Disables**
   * **Do NOT use `#pragma warning disable` / `#pragma warning restore` as a shortcut to ignore compiler warnings**.
   * You must write clean, type-safe, and null-safe code that naturally resolves all compiler warnings (e.g., proper null checks, pattern matching, explicit casting). Warnings must be resolved programmatically rather than suppressed.
   * This applies to test code too: an MSTest analyzer warning (e.g. `MSTEST0037` suggesting `Assert.IsTrue`/`Assert.HasCount`/`Assert.IsGreaterThan` over a raw `Assert.AreEqual`/boolean comparison) gets fixed by using the suggested assertion, never suppressed.

9. **No Fallback Translation Strings in Code**
   * **Do NOT append a hardcoded fallback string to a translation lookup** (e.g. `TranslationService.Get("Key") ?? "Some Default Text"`, `TranslationManager.Instance["Key"] ?? "Some Default Text"`). Both lookup APIs are non-nullable and already return a visible `[Key]` placeholder when a key is missing, so such a `??` fallback is always dead code — it can never actually run, and hides which translation would show a `[Key]` placeholder instead of surfacing the bug.
   * If a translation key is missing from the locale JSON files, the fix is to add the key (in every locale the project ships), not to paper over it with an inline fallback string in the `.cs` file.

10. **Mandatory Test Coverage for New or Changed Testable Code**
   * Whenever you write new code or modify existing code, if that code contains real logic worth testing (pure functions, branching/decision logic, algorithms, parsing, state derivation), you **must** add or update MSTest coverage for it as part of the same change — do not wait to be asked separately. Tests live under `Tests/<ProjectName>/`, mirroring the production project's folder structure; a test project's `.csproj` is named after the production project it tests (e.g. `Tests/Core/Core.csproj`, not `Lertaro.Core.Tests.csproj`), with `AssemblyName`/`RootNamespace` set explicitly to `Lertaro.<ProjectName>.Tests`.
   * "Worth testing" excludes trivial property forwarding (`get => _x; set => SetProperty(ref _x, value)`), real OS/P-Invoke/COM/named-pipe/Dispatcher-bound orchestration with no injectable seam, and pure UI/XAML glue — do not write tests for these just to hit a coverage number.
   * When the interesting logic is welded to real I/O (registry, network, process launch, IPC), prefer extracting the decision itself into a small pure method that the untestable orchestration code calls into (e.g. `FileExecutor.BuildStartInfo`, `UpdateCheckService.IsNewerVersion`) over skipping coverage entirely. This is the default move, not a last resort — only fall back to leaving something untested when no such extraction is reasonably possible.
   * Prefer this kind of additive extraction over introducing new dependency-injection plumbing through several constructors; reach for a larger DI refactor only when the user explicitly asks for it.
   * This rule is forward-looking: it does not require retroactively covering pre-existing code you are not otherwise touching in the current change.

11. **Test Code Conventions & Infrastructure**
    * **Directory structure and namespaces mirror production 1:1**: a test for `App/ViewModels/Settings/Plugins/PluginConfigFieldViewModel.cs` lives at `Tests/App/ViewModels/Settings/Plugins/PluginConfigFieldViewModelTests.cs`. Its namespace is the production namespace with `Lertaro.<ProjectName>` replaced by `Lertaro.<ProjectName>.Tests` and every segment after that left unchanged (production `Lertaro.App.ViewModels.Settings.Plugins` → test `Lertaro.App.Tests.ViewModels.Settings.Plugins`). New test subfolders/namespace segments must appear the moment the matching production subfolder does — do not flatten multiple production subfolders into one test file's namespace, and do not invent a test-side folder that has no production counterpart.
    * Test class naming: one `[TestClass]` named `<ProductionTypeName>Tests` per production type under test. When a single production file declares several small related types (as rule 6 already allows for tightly-coupled helpers), its test file may likewise declare one `[TestClass]` per type, keeping the same grouping the production file uses.
    * Give each new test project its own `MSTestSettings.cs` containing `[assembly: Parallelize(Scope = ExecutionScope.MethodLevel)]`.
    * When a test needs to reach an `internal` member, add `<InternalsVisibleTo Include="Lertaro.<ProjectName>.Tests" />` to the production project's `.csproj` — do not widen the member to `public` just to make it testable.
    * **No test-only hooks in production classes**: never add a test-only constructor, marker type, or settable static override/instance hook (e.g. an internal `TestConstruction`-marker constructor, a `_testOverride` singleton backdoor) directly into a production class just to make it constructible in isolation. `InternalsVisibleTo` in the production `.csproj` is the one sanctioned exception — a project-level assembly attribute that touches no class body and has zero runtime effect, unlike scaffolding embedded in the class itself. If a class genuinely can't be constructed/tested without deeper changes, prefer extracting the testable logic into a separate pure method or class (rule 10) over adding test-specific surface area to the untestable one.
    * **Shared static/singleton state**: if a test sets or reads process-wide static state (a `static` field, a singleton's mutable state, a `PluginSdk` static delegate seam like `GetSettingFunc`/`LookupFunc`), mark the test class `[DoNotParallelize]` and reset that state in `[TestInitialize]`/`[TestCleanup]`. Do not assume tests in different files run isolated from each other — MSTest parallelizes at the method level by default (see the `MSTestSettings.cs` rule above), so leftover static state from one test silently changes another test's outcome unless it's explicitly reset every time, including before the very first test (a prior failed run can leave stale state behind).
    * **WPF `FrameworkElement` construction in tests**: MSTest's default test threads are MTA; constructing any `System.Windows.*` `FrameworkElement` (`Grid`, `MenuItem`, `ContextMenu`, ...) throws `InvalidOperationException` unless the test method runs on an STA thread. Use `[StaTestMethod]` (see `Tests/App/StaTestMethodAttribute.cs`) instead of `[TestMethod]` for any test that constructs one, directly or indirectly.
    * **No mocking frameworks**: fakes/stubs are hand-written nested classes implementing only the interface/abstract members the test actually needs (look for `Fake*`/`private sealed class Fake...` anywhere under `Tests/` for the existing pattern) — do not add Moq, NSubstitute, or similar as a dependency.
    * **Verify before trusting**: before writing a test against a class, read its actual constructor and the method bodies under test yourself. Do not assume a class is safe to construct, or that a member's accessibility (`public`/`internal`/`private`) matches what a prior summary, comment, or triage pass claimed — verify directly, every time.
    * Build and run only the specific test project you changed (see rule 1 — never blind-build the whole solution), and when a test fails, fix it based on the real failure output, not by re-guessing what the "correct" expected value should have been.

12. **Comment Language & Detailed Documentation**
    * All comments in `.cs` files must be written in **English**, including comments that explain or reference Chinese-language text, bug reports, or user-facing strings.
    * **Detailed Comments When Necessary**: Whenever code contains non-obvious logic, complex algorithms, edge-case handlings, or architectural rationale, write clear and detailed comments explaining the context so future maintainers understand why it was built that way.

13. **No Double-Hyphen in XML-Style Comments**
    * Do not use `--` inside `<!-- ... -->` comments in `.xaml` or `.csproj` files — MSBuild/XAML parses a literal `--` inside an XML comment as a syntax error (`MC3000`/`MSB4025`). Use `:` or rephrase instead. This is a recurring mistake; double-check any comment you write in these file types before saving.

14. **How to Split a File (Composition, Naming, Subfolders)**
    * When rule 5 requires splitting a file, extract the cohesive piece into a separate class the original *holds a reference to and delegates to* (composition) — never a base class the original inherits from, and never `partial` (already banned by rule 5). The extracted class typically takes the owning instance as a constructor parameter when it needs to read/write the owner's state (e.g. `PluginConfigArrayFieldSupport(PluginConfigFieldViewModel field)`; a static helper instead takes the owner as a per-call parameter, e.g. `NetworkDrivePermissionsHelper.UpdateRowPermissions(NetworkDriveSettingsViewModel vm, ...)`).
    * Name the extracted class for its concern, ending in `Helper`/`Support`/a specific role noun (`NetworkDrivePermissionsHelper`, `NetworkDriveSummaryHelper`, `PluginConfigArrayFieldSupport`, `ActionsMenuNavigator`) — never a generic `Utils`/`Common`/`Misc` grab-bag.
    * State the reason for the split in a short comment on the extracted class or file (this codebase's existing convention is close to: *"Split out purely to keep that file under the repo's per-file line limit; this class has no state of its own, it always operates on the one X that owns it"*) — expected documentation here, not optional decoration.
    * **Single overflowing class vs. topic subfolder**: one class alone crossing 300 lines gets one sibling helper file in the same folder. When a whole *feature area* accumulates several related files (not just one overflowing class), group them into a topic-named subfolder with a matching nested namespace segment per rule 6 (e.g. `Settings/NetworkDrive/`, `Settings/LocalDrive/`, `Settings/Plugins/`, `Providers/InstantAnswers/`, `Providers/Filters/`, `Providers/Indexing/`). Subfolder names are the feature/topic, not the file type (no `Helpers/`/`Models/`-style grouping by kind).
    * This kind of split stays inside the existing project (App, Core, a given plugin) — it is never a reason to carve off a new `.csproj`.

15. **No Privacy-Sensitive Information in Code, Comments, or Tests**
    * **Production code, comments, and test code/fixtures must never contain privacy-sensitive information** — the developer's real Windows username, machine name, email address, personal file paths, or any other personally-identifying data — even when it was copied verbatim from a real screenshot, log, or live debugging session. Use a generic placeholder instead (e.g. `C:\Users\testuser\Desktop`, not the developer's real profile path) in all three: the code itself, comments explaining it, and any test that exercises it.
    * This applies regardless of how innocuous the string seems ("it's just a username"): this repo is public with active forks, and anything pushed can end up copied into a fork before you notice the mistake — at that point it's effectively unrecoverable (rewriting/force-pushing history only cleans the origin repo going forward, not any fork that already synced the old commits). Treat it with the same "assume it's now permanent" caution as any other exposed personal data, rather than something a later commit can quietly undo.
    * Before committing, scan any new or touched file for real paths/usernames/identifiers that slipped in from a live debugging session (screenshots, logs, pasted output) — do not rely on remembering to substitute them as you write, verify at the end.
    * (Incident: a WinRAR/Bandizip test suite hardcoded the developer's real `C:\Users\<realusername>\Desktop` path, copied directly from a live debugging screenshot, and it was pushed to the public repo before being caught.)

16. **Never Hard-Wrap a CJK Paragraph in Markdown**
    * **In `Site/**/*.md`, a paragraph of Chinese or Japanese text goes on one line, however long.** Markdown joins the lines of a wrapped paragraph with a space when it renders, which is correct between Latin words and between a CJK character and a Latin one, but between two CJK characters it renders a space nobody wrote: `…专门负责文件索引。这` + `个拆分是有意为之的…` comes out as `…这 个拆分…`. Breaking a line is only safe where Latin sits on one side of the break.
    * Applies to `zh-CN`, `zh-HK`, `zh-TW` and `ja-JP`. `ko-KR`, `es-ES` and `en-US` are unaffected — a break between two words there renders exactly the space those languages already want.
    * **Never put a line break directly beside a `**` or `_`.** Whether those delimiters open or close depends on the characters either side of them, and a line break counts as whitespace there, so a break next to one can silently turn the emphasis into literal asterisks in the output. Applies both to breaking a line there and to joining one.
    * **Write `[**text**](url)`, not `**[text](url)**`, when CJK or Hangul sits directly against it.** The outer form does not parse in that position and leaks literal `**` into the page — the only construct found to break this way. Adding a space around the `**` also fixes it, but that is the space this rule exists to avoid.
    * Verify by building the site before and after (`npm run site:build` in `Site/`) and comparing the rendered output, not by reading the Markdown: the whole class of bug is invisible in the source. Count `<strong>`/`<em>` (must not move), literal `**` in the text (must not increase — the exclusion-rule pages legitimately contain some, as glob wildcards), and matches of "CJK, space, CJK".
    * (Incident: 1418 of these across 108 files in four locales, plus eight bold spans already broken by the `**[link]**` form, all shipped and live before anyone noticed.)

17. **Mandatory All-Locale Synchronization for Site Documentation (`Site/`)**
    * Whenever any Site documentation file (under `Site/`) is created, modified, or updated, **ALL supported site locales** (all language directories under `Site/` including `user-guide/` root and any future added locales) must be updated and kept in sync simultaneously.
    * Never update only one locale (e.g. `zh-CN`) and leave the others behind. Every change, feature addition, or troubleshooting note in documentation must be translated and synchronized across every locale directory that exists in `Site/`.
    * Always enforce Rule 16 (single un-wrapped lines for CJK/Japanese paragraphs) when editing Chinese or Japanese site pages.
    * Always verify by running `npm run site:build` in `Site/` after making any documentation changes.

18. **Mandatory All-Locale Synchronization for Plugin Translations (`Plugins/`)**
    * Whenever a plugin translation key, string, or locale file (under `Plugins/<PluginName>/Resources/Translations/`) is added, updated, or modified, **ALL supported plugin locales** (all locale directories present under `Resources/Translations/` for that plugin) must be updated in sync.
    * Never add or update a translation key in only one locale while leaving other locale JSON files missing the key.
    * Combine with Rule 9: No hardcoded fallback strings in `.cs` code — when a new user-facing string is introduced in a plugin, add the translation key to all locale JSON files shipped by that plugin simultaneously.
