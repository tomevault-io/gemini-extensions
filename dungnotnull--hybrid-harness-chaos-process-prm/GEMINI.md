## Devil's Advocate Integration (s35)

Adapted from [dungnotnull/devils-advocate-agent](https://github.com/dungnotnull/devils-advocate-agent), s35 provides:

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **4 Intensity Levels** | Skeptic (1) -> Critic (2) -> Prosecutor (3) -> Demolisher (4) |
| **14+ Fallacy Types** | Ad Hominem, Straw Man, Hasty Generalization, False Dichotomy, Slippery Slope, etc. |
| **5-Dimension Scoring** | Clarity, Evidence Quality, Logical Consistency, Novelty, Defense Improvement (0-100 each) |
| **4-Perspective Challenge** | Business, Engineering, Reliability, Security lenses |
| **Quality Gate Verdict** | PASS (>=70), CONDITIONAL (>=50), FAIL (<50 or any dimension <40) |
| **Optional ML Enhancement** | Can integrate with Devil's Advocate Agent for NLI-based fallacy detection and RAG-grounded counter-arguments |

Use /critique [subject] via the Claude Plugin or invoke s35 directly in any skill workflow.

## Progress Tracking & Development Phase Management

### Local State (.commandcode/progress.json)
The progress-tracker CLI manages workflow state:
`
progress-tracker init --project-name "my-project"
progress-tracker status          # Show dashboard
progress-tracker next            # Show next phase
progress-tracker transition 04-pipeline-design in_progress --agent "claude-code"
progress-tracker block "Waiting for security approval"
progress-tracker resolve BLK-001
progress-tracker report          # Generate full report
progress-tracker handoff         # Agent handoff summary
`

### CI/CD Gates (GitHub Actions)
Every PR is validated by .github/workflows/ci.yml:
- All SKILL.md files pass structural validation
- Python code passes linting (ruff)
- Cross-references between skills are correct
- SKILLS-CATALOG.md is up to date

### Pre-commit Hooks
`
pip install pre-commit && pre-commit install
`
Enforces: skill validation, YAML/JSON syntax, trailing whitespace, no direct commits to main.

## Plugin Integration (Claude Code/Cowork)

This project includes a .claude-plugin/ manifest for first-class Claude Code/Cowork integration:

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| /orchestrate [phase] | Start or resume the full workflow from any phase |
| /critique [subject] | Invoke Devil's Advocate (s35) to stress-test any decision |
| /progress | Show workflow progress dashboard |
| /validate | Validate all SKILL.md files for structural correctness |

Adapted from [anthropics/knowledge-work-plugins](https://github.com/anthropics/knowledge-work-plugins) plugin architecture pattern.

## Global Engineering Principles

All AI agents working in this project MUST follow:

### 1. Safety First, Always
- Never run destructive operations without explicit human approval
- All chaos experiments require dryRun: true validation before live execution
- Blast radius must be documented and bounded before any fault injection

### 2. Hypothesis-Driven Everything
- No pipeline stage without a defined success criterion
- No chaos experiment without a formal hypothesis
- No feature flag without a measurable rollout metric

### 3. Security as a Gate (NOT an Afterthought)
- Security scanning (s11) runs on EVERY build — no exceptions
- Zero HIGH/CRITICAL CVEs with fixes available = deployment blocked
- SBOM generated for every artifact, signed, and archived
- SLSA Level 3 provenance for all production artifacts

### 4. Performance Before Chaos
- Load/stress testing (s13) MUST run before chaos (s14)
- Without performance baseline, chaos results are meaningless
- Combined chaos+load tests validate resilience under realistic traffic

### 5. Observability as a Gate
- Every deployment pipeline MUST have a verification step
- Every chaos experiment MUST have monitoring active before fault injection
- If observability is absent, block execution

### 6. Infrastructure as Code
- All Harness resources expressed as YAML
- All chaos experiments expressed as ChaosEngine / ChaosExperiment manifests
- No manual UI-only changes

### 7. Least Privilege
- Harness delegates scoped to minimum required namespaces
- Chaos service accounts scoped to target namespace
- Secrets never printed to logs

### 8. Adversarial Quality Gates
- Every major decision CAN be stress-tested through s35 (Devil's Advocate)
- No design, hypothesis, or release goes unchallenged
- Intensity level defaults: L2 (Critic) for design reviews, L3 (Prosecutor) for security, L4 (Demolisher) for release gates

### 9. Release Governance
- Every production deployment has a Go/No-Go checklist (s28)
- Deployment calendar respected — no Friday deploys, no freeze-period deploys
- Rollback plan tested and documented BEFORE deployment

### 10. Compliance is Continuous (Not Annual)
- Audit trail auto-generated quarterly (s30)
- Control mapping updated with every new skill implementation
- Evidence signed and timestamped (Cosign + Rekor)

### 11. Taste-Aware Execution
- Every agent loads .commandcode/taste/taste.md before acting
- Developer preferences override defaults
- New preferences learned and stored by s02

## Skill Execution Protocol

`
Step 1:  IDENTIFY current phase from progress.json (s03)
Step 2:  READ the orchestrator (s00) for context
Step 3:  READ the target skill's SKILL.md completely
Step 4:  VERIFY input contract — all prerequisites satisfied
Step 5:  LOAD taste data from .commandcode/taste/
Step 6:  CHECK AI Agent Integration section in SKILL.md
         - Identify applicable Harness AI agent (if any)
         - Determine current autonomy level
         - Prepare human gates for approval
Step 7:  EXECUTE following the skill's prescribed workflow
         - Call Harness AI agent when available (orchestration layer)
         - Fall back to manual/template execution when unavailable
Step 8:  CAPTURE outputs into workflow context
Step 9:  UPDATE progress.json via s03 / progress-tracker CLI
Step 10: NOTIFY orchestrator of completion
Step 11: DISPATCH to next skill in sequence

Optional: INVOKE s35 (Devil's Advocate) at any quality gate
         - After design decisions, before blast radius approval
         - After hypothesis formation, before acceptance criteria lock
         - Before Go/No-Go decisions (s28)
         - After strategic proposals (s31)

## AI Agent Architecture

All 37 skills integrate with **Harness AI's specialized agent ecosystem** and the broader chaos engineering MCP ecosystem. See skills/AI-AGENT-MAPPING.md for the complete mapping.

### SRE Autonomy Levels (Google SRE Framework)

Every skill declares its autonomy level in its SKILL.md:

| Level | Name | Agent Role |
|---|---|---|
| **L0** | Manual | None |
| **L1** | Hypothesis | AI suggests, human decides |
| **L2** | Assisted | AI drafts, human approves |
| **L3** | Delegated | AI executes, human reviews |
| **L4** | Full Autonomy | AI acts independently |

**Current project state**: L1-L2. **Target**: L2-L3. **Safety-critical skills (s16, s29)** remain L1-L2 permanently. **Devil's Advocate (s35)** is adversarial by design — intentionally independent of any Harness AI agent.

### Harness AI Agent Coverage

| Agent | Model | Skills Covered |
|---|---|---|
| DevOps Agent | Claude Opus 4.5 (Vertex AI) | s01, s01-1, s04-s10, s24, s28 |
| Reliability Agent | Harness AI | s14-s20, s26 |
| SRE Agent | Harness AI | s21-s23, s27, s29 |
| Test Agent | Harness AI | s12-s13 |
| FinOps Agent | Harness AI | s25 |
| AppSec/STO Agent | Harness AI | s11, s30 |
| Knowledge Graph | Harness AI | s03 |
| None (adversarial by design) | — | s35 |
| Multi-agent | Harness AI | s33 |

### MCP Integration (Chaos Skills)

| Platform | MCP Server | Integration Skills |
|---|---|---|
| LitmusChaos | litmuschaos-mcp | s14-s20 |
| Gremlin | gremlin-mcp | s14-s17 |
| Steadybit | steadybit-mcp | s14-s20 |
| AWS FIS | aws-fis-bedrock | s18 |
| Harness Chaos | Native AI | s14-s20 |

### Research Backing

Key evidence supporting this architecture (from 34-source deep research, 2026-05-27):
- **ChaosEater (ASE 2025)**: LLM agents automate full chaos lifecycle on Kubernetes
- **AIOpsLab (Microsoft 2024)**: Establish pattern: chaos injection + AI fault localization + resolution
- **Google SRE AI Operator**: L2/L3 autonomous mitigation across thousands of incidents
- **LLM RCA accuracy**: 60-74% few-shot vs 82% human — co-pilot, not autonomous
- **Application-level chaos**: Only 3.0% of real experiments (this project's s19 addresses this gap)
- **No published research** exists on integrated CI/CD + chaos + governance AI workflows

### Data Privacy

| Aspect | Policy |
|---|---|
| Model training | Disabled across all AI integrations |
| Data storage | Not stored or exposed to model providers beyond inference |
| Primary model | Claude Opus 4.5 via Google Vertex AI (0-day retention) |
| Fallback model | OpenAI GPT-4o (30-day retention, training opted out) |
| Data ownership | Customer owns all data |
| Compliance | Built on strongest governance framework |
