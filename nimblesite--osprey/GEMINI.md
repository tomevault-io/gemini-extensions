This file provides guidance for agents when working with code in this repository.

⚠️ NEVER ASk THE USER QUESTIONS! USER YOUR JUDGEMENT. ACT AUTONOMOUSLY ⚠️
⚠️ **NEVER DUPLICATE CODE** - Edit in place, never create new versions. Use deslop - find-similar before adding code, and deslop-top-offenders after modifying code ⚠️
⚠️ DO NOT USE GIT - ESPECIALLY NOT PUTTING YOUR SIGNATURE ON COMMITS ⚠️
⚠️ PRACTICE TOKEN ECONOMICS ⚠️
⚠️ ZERO DUPLICATE CODE ⚠️

## Core Development Principles

- **NO PLACEHOLDERS** - Fix existing placeholders or fail with error
- **RUN make ci ROUTINELY** - Many clippy lints can be easily fixed with auto fix. Don't try to fix them yourself
- **PREFER EXPANDING EXISTING EXAMPLES AND TESTS** - Don't add new examples/tests
- **DO NOT USE GIT - IN PARTICULAR, DO NOT STAMP YOURSELF AS COAUTHOR** - unless explicitly requested
- **MAKE EXAMPLES (TESTS) CONCISE AND MIX WITH MANY LANGUAGE CONSTRUCTS** - Don't create many files with overlapping functionality
- **KEEP ALL FILES UNDER 500 LOC** - Break large files into focused modules 
- **KEEP FUNCTIONS BELOW 20 LOC**
- **FP STYLE CODE** - pure functions over OOP style
- **Handle all panics and return Result<T,E>** instead of throwing
- **USE CONSTANTS** - Name values meaningfully instead of using literals

## Rust

- **Panics are illegal** Return Result<T,E>
- **unwrap() and similar are illegal** Use pattern matching

## Osprey

- **Osprey is an FP language** - Use constructs that other FP languages use:
  - Immutable types
  - Expressions over statements
  - Avoid brackets where they are not necessary (ML style)
  - Use algebraic effects for abstractions
  - The best function is a single expression with no side effects (pure)
  - Avoid consecutive statements and assignments, even when assignments add
    clarity
- **LEAN ON TYPE INFERENCE — DO NOT WRITE REDUNDANT TYPE ANNOTATIONS** -
  Osprey is Hindley-Milner: every type the compiler can infer must be left
  off. This is a core style rule of the language — less redundancy.
  - **Never annotate function parameters** when their type is inferable from
    the body or call site. Write `fn add(a, b) = a + b`, NOT
    `fn add(a: int, b: int) = a + b`.
  - **Never annotate a function return type** when it is inferable. Write
    `fn isEven(x) = (x % 2) == 0`, NOT `fn isEven(x: int) -> bool = ...`.
  - **Never annotate lambda parameters** when inferable: `|x| => x * 2`, not
    `|x: int| => x * 2`.
  - Keep an annotation ONLY when the compiler genuinely cannot infer it: an
    empty literal with no context (`let xs: List<int> = []`), an `extern` /
    ambiguous return, an unconstrained polymorphic type variable, or a
    load-bearing return type that forces `Result<T, MathError>` to
    auto-unwrap to `T`. If removing an annotation still compiles and produces
    identical output, it was redundant — remove it.
  - This applies to ALL `.osp` you write or touch — `examples/tested/`,
    `benchmarks/`, docs, and website snippets alike.
- **NO CONSECUTIVE PRINT CALLS IN OSP** - Use string interpolation! Consolidate consecutive prints into singular interpolated strings!!!

## Commands

**Primary Development Commands (run from the repo root):**
```bash
make build         # C runtime archives + cargo build --release + VSCode extension
make test          # All tests + coverage thresholds + differential example harness
make lint          # cargo clippy + extension lint
make fmt           # Format all code in-place (CHECK=1 for read-only check)
make ci            # lint + test + build (full CI simulation)
make clean         # Clean all build artifacts
```

**Development Commands:**
```bash
make run FILE=<path>       # Compile and run an Osprey file (osprey <file> --run)
make install               # Install osprey + runtime archives system-wide
make _rebuild-install-vsix  # Rebuild + reinstall the VSCode extension (macOS)
```

The compiler binary lands at `target/release/osprey`.

**VSCode Extension:**
```bash
cd vscode-extension
npm install && npm run compile    # Build VSCode extension
npm test                         # Run extension tests
```

**Website Development:**
```bash
cd website
npm install && npm run dev       # Start local development server
npm run build                    # Build static site
```

**CSS HARD BUDGET 1.8K LOC** BLOGS, SPECS, DOCS = PROSE = SAME CSS NAME PREFIX PROSE
**ZERO TAILWIND** CONVERT TO CSS IMMEDIATELY

**WebCompiler (Browser-based):**
```bash
cd webcompiler  
npm install && npm start         # Start web-based compiler service
```

## High-Level Architecture

**Repository Structure:**
- `crates/` - Core Osprey compiler (Rust workspace → LLVM)
- `tree-sitter-osprey/` - Tree-sitter grammar for parsing
- `compiler/` - Pure-C runtime sources (`runtime/`) + example programs (`examples/`)
- `vscode-extension/` - VSCode language support with TypeScript
- `website/` - Documentation site using 11ty static site generator
- `webcompiler/` - Node.js web service for browser compilation
- `homebrew-package/` - Homebrew tap for macOS installation

**Compiler Architecture (Rust-based):**
- **Parser**: Tree-sitter grammar (`tree-sitter-osprey/`) consumed by `crates/osprey-syntax`
- **AST**: Abstract Syntax Tree types in `crates/osprey-ast`
- **Type System**: Hindley-Milner type inference in `crates/osprey-types`
- **Code Generation**: LLVM IR generation in `crates/osprey-codegen`
- **CLI**: `crates/osprey-cli` (the `osprey` binary); `crates/osprey-runtime-sys` links the C runtime
- **Runtime**: C libraries (`compiler/runtime/`) for fiber concurrency, HTTP/WebSocket, system operations

**Language Features:**
- **Algebraic Effects**: First-class effects system with compile-time safety
- **Fiber Concurrency**: Lightweight isolated execution contexts
- **Pattern Matching**: Union types with exhaustiveness checking
- **Functional Programming**: Immutable data, pipe operators, iterators
- **HTTP/WebSocket**: Built-in networking with streaming support
- **Type Safety**: Strong static typing with inference

**Multi-Language Runtime:**
- **Rust**: Compiler frontend, parsing, type checking, codegen (`crates/`)
- **C**: Performance-critical runtime (fibers, HTTP, WebSockets) — stays C
- **LLVM IR**: Compilation target for optimized execution

**Key Technical Patterns:**
- Effects are declared with `effect` keyword and handled with `handle...in` expressions
- Unhandled effects cause compilation errors (world-first compile-time effect safety)
- Pattern matching is mandatory for `any` types and union types
- All HTTP/WebSocket operations return `Result<T, String>` for error handling
- Fiber isolation prevents shared memory bugs through message passing

**Testing Strategy:**
- Unit tests live inside each crate in `crates/`
- `examples/tested/` - Working examples run via the differential harness (`crates/diff_examples.sh`); output must match `.expectedoutput` byte-for-byte
- `examples/failscompilation/` - Error cases the compiler must reject
- Coverage thresholds enforced per-project via `coverage-thresholds.json`

**Security Architecture:**
- Configurable sandboxing for file access, HTTP, and process execution
- C runtime compiled with security hardening flags (`-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2`, `-fstack-protector-strong`)
- All warnings treated as errors in C compilation
- Effect system provides capability-based security

**Development Workflow:**
1. **Grammar Changes**: Edit the tree-sitter grammar in `tree-sitter-osprey/`
2. **Language Features**: Implement in `osprey-syntax`/`osprey-ast`, then `osprey-codegen`
3. **Testing**: Add examples to `examples/tested/` and error cases to `examples/failscompilation/`
4. **Type System**: Extend `crates/osprey-types` for new type rules
5. **Runtime**: Add C functions in `compiler/runtime/` for system operations

**AI-Assisted Development Notes:**
- This compiler is built using various AI agents and models
- AI can help with tree-sitter grammars, LLVM IR generation, and type inference
- The codebase follows clear patterns that AI can recognize and extend
- Use VS Code Dev Container for consistent development environment

This is a functional programming language compiler with algebraic effects, fiber-based concurrency, and strong compile-time safety guarantees.

## Standard Build Commands

```bash
make build        # Build compiler + VSCode extension
make test         # Fail-fast tests + coverage + threshold (coverage-thresholds.json)
make lint         # Run all linters (cargo clippy + extension lint)
make fmt          # Format all code in-place
make clean        # Remove build artifacts
make ci           # lint + test + build (full CI simulation)
make setup        # Post-create dev environment setup
```

## Releases & Versioning

- **Releases are tag-triggered only.** Push `vX.Y.Z` → `release.yml` builds all
  platforms, cuts the GitHub Release, updates the Homebrew tap + Scoop bucket,
  publishes the VS Code extension (`nimblesite.osprey`), and deploys the website.
- **CI runs only on PRs to `main`.** Merging to `main` triggers nothing.
- **Versions are NEVER hard-coded.** Every source version field stays at the
  placeholder `0.0.0-dev` (root `Cargo.toml` workspace version,
  `vscode-extension/package.json`, `shipwright.json`); the real version is
  stamped from the git tag at build time. Changing a placeholder to a real
  version in source is a defect. Follows the Shipwright contract
  ([SWR-VERSION-*]). See [docs/RELEASING.md](docs/RELEASING.md).

## Spec IDs

Spec IDs are hierarchical descriptive slugs in the format `[GROUP-TOPIC]` or `[GROUP-TOPIC-DETAIL]`. NEVER use numbered IDs (`[SPEC-001]`). Code implementing a spec section MUST reference its ID in a comment. Example: `// Implements [PARSER-EFFECTS-HANDLE]`.

## Branch Naming

| Type | Pattern | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| Feature | `feature/[ISSUE]-[slug]` | `feature/42-add-pattern-matching` |
| Bug fix | `fix/[ISSUE]-[slug]` | `fix/17-null-ref-effects` |
| Chore | `chore/[slug]` | `chore/update-deps` |
| Claude agent | `claude/[slug]-[random5]` | `claude/refactor-XYZab` |

All changes via PR — no direct pushes to `main`. Squash-merge preferred.
