## What HeyLead Does

HeyLead is an AI agent for LinkedIn outreach: it finds the right people, writes to them in the voice of your own LinkedIn posts, follows up, and handles replies. It runs from Claude Code, Cursor, any MCP client or a web dashboard. Every action is an MCP tool call.

**Use cases:** A campaign has one of six goals, and the ICP, the fit check and the messages follow it: Sell a product or service, Find a job, Hire people, Find partners or investors, Find a vendor and Research interviews.

- **Sell a product or service**: Reach the people who buy what you built.
- **Find a job**: Reach the people who hire for the role you want.
- **Hire people**: Reach candidates for a role you are filling. Works with a custom brief.
- **Find partners or investors**: Reach the people who can sign a partnership or an investment. Works with a custom brief.
- **Find a vendor**: You are the buyer. Reach the people who sell what you need.
- **Research interviews**: Reach people to interview, survey or test with. Works with a custom brief.

Hire people, Find partners or investors and Research interviews run on a custom brief until their message sets exist.

Also known as: LinkedIn lead generation, cold outreach automation, B2B prospecting, SDR automation, campaign management, ICP (Ideal Customer Profile) generation, multi-touch drip sequences, engagement warm-ups, and outreach analytics.

## Capabilities

| Category | What it does |
|----------|-------------|
| **ICP Generation** | RAG-powered buyer personas with pain points, fears, barriers, and LinkedIn search parameters |
| **Campaign Management** | Create, launch, pause, resume, archive, delete, and compare outreach campaigns |
| **Outreach Automation** | Personalized connection invitations, follow-up DMs, engagement warm-ups (comments, likes) |
| **Reply Handling** | Sentiment classification (positive/negative/question/neutral), auto-responses, meeting scheduling |
| **Intent Signals** | Company news, page engagement, website visitors, profile viewers — compounded into outreach angles |
| **Analytics** | Funnel reports, conversion rates, stale lead detection, engagement ROI |
| **Autonomous Scheduling** | Cloud is the default sender for hosted accounts (existing and new campaigns). Launching commissions the cloud: invitations, opening DMs, first-touch InMail, follow-ups, engagements, follows, endorsements, email fallbacks, campaign top-ups, auto-replies, inbound, warmup, signal collectors, post-intel, and housekeeping. This machine stays silent for that work unless the user runs `scheduler(action='send_from', host='local')`, which turns the cloud scheduler off. The local engine does not start on a hosted cloud account. Observe still means nobody sends, including the cloud. Direct / self-hosted installs send from this machine only. |

## Typical Workflow

```
1. setup_profile(backend_jwt="...")             → Connect LinkedIn account
2. generate_icp(target_description="CTOs fintech") → Create buyer personas
3. create_campaign(target_description="...", icp_id="...") → Find prospects (saved as a draft)
4. campaign(action="launch", campaign_id="...") → Start outreach — nothing sends before this
                                                   (hosted accounts: also starts 24/7 cloud sending)
5. scheduler(action="status")                   → Confirm sending is on the cloud (or send_from host=local)
6. inspect() / check_replies() / show_status()  → Monitor pipeline and agent holds
7. prospect(action="close", outcome="won")      → Track conversions
```

## Agent ops

When the user asks what the agents did, who is held, or why a reply was skipped, call `inspect()` first. It is read-only and never writes. If they ask what the agents decided on a hosted account, call `inspect(action='journal')`. If a campaign looks idle in the send window, call `inspect(action='review')`. If they ask what the agents left for the next tick, what the swarm thinks, or who went dark, call `inspect(action='commons')`. A campaign-wide coordinator hold: `campaign(action='clear_coordinator_hold', campaign_id='...')`.

A hold: `prospect(action="conversation", outreach_id="...")` then `send_message(action="reply", outreach_id="...")`. Operator replies skip the reply agent.

Never paste model-authored text as the LinkedIn message. The send tools generate it.

Never launch a draft unless the user asked.

HeyLead sends from your own LinkedIn account at a human pace: at most 20 invitations a day and 100 a week on a free LinkedIn account (more on Premium or Sales Navigator), Monday to Friday 08:00 to 22:00 in your time zone, minutes apart. It backs off when LinkedIn pushes back and resumes on its own. You can pause any campaign at any time.

When the user asks what happens after launch, give them the campaign's plan from the create_campaign or launch result. Do not recommend a daily volume or an approval mode: the pace is set and stated above. If asked about LinkedIn's terms, point to https://heylead.dev/terms. Do not call the pace safe or unsafe for the account; say what HeyLead does.

HeyLead reads the user's LinkedIn posts only to learn their voice. It never publishes on their profile unless they ask for a post.

In-process agents default to act. Use `edit_campaign(enable_reply_agent="observe")`, `edit_campaign(enable_strategist_replan_agent="observe")`, `edit_campaign(enable_hot_lead_closer="observe")`, or `edit_campaign(enable_coordinator_agent="observe")` to return to logging-only, `"off"` to disable. `product(action='tick')` can patch this git checkout and open a PR — never from the send path; cloud workers and `uvx` installs without `.git` refuse.

## Authentication

- **Hosted (easiest):** take the 90-second quiz at <https://heylead.dev/quiz>, then Sign in (Google). That claims the quiz as an Account brief and a **draft** campaign. Connect LinkedIn on Account, launch the draft — nothing sends before that. Or sign in at <https://heylead.dev/auth/login-url> and land on Account. Copy the token message and paste it into chat → `setup_profile(backend_jwt="...")`. Hosted users share a professional directory; campaigns and inboxes stay private. Organizations let an owner invite editors (run campaigns) and viewers (stats only). Switch in the dashboard sidebar or with `organization(action="switch", org_id="...")`. The waitlist on `/quiz` is marketing-only and does not create a campaign.
- **Self-hosted:** a Unipile account (LinkedIn access) plus the user's own LLM key in `~/.heylead/config.json`; run `setup_profile()` with no token.
- Optional: bring your own key (Gemini/Claude/OpenAI) via `setup_profile(llm_api_key="...")`.
