# hcifootprint — feature-work map

Turns a web app's interaction surface into a typed, traversable journey graph an LLM can
plan over. You author **actions** and name **journeys**; a **tool** is what is served to a
model. One authored sentence (`does`) is both the human's label and the model's tool
description. Everything relational — routes between pages, which action unblocks which — is
**derived from declarations made for other reasons**, never authored. **Trust the code**
where any doc disagrees.

**The vocabulary (1.10.0):** you declare the JourneyMap; the session is the Walker; the
recording carries both. `defineJourneyMap`/`JourneyMap` are permanent reference-equal aliases of
`buildNavigationGraph`/`NavigationGraph` (tree/appmap.ts) — both names ship forever, neither is a
rename, and there is deliberately NO `Walker` export: the walker is the session. Three movers move
it — **human** (a real click, `principal: 'user'`), **agent** (the four served verbs `whats_here` /
`why` / `do_action` / `did_it_work`), **guard** (your data: `when`/`enabledWhen`) — plus the world's
own `Cause.kind: 'stimulus'`. Same pattern at three altitudes: footprintjs walks stages,
agentfootprint (`defineSkillMap`) walks skills, this walks screens.

**An effect already held (1.12.0):** **An effect that is already true is not a pending one. When an
action's declarative verify contract covers every key it declares it writes and already holds at
fire time, the fire never waits for a state report that nothing will send — it settles on its own
handler and answers `alreadyTrue`.** The rule lives in ONE small module (traverse/already-true.ts,
five conditions) called from `fire()` before the record is minted; it flips exactly one boolean in
the state-tap arm's guard, so an already-true fire falls through to the tapless block and waits on
the HANDLER rail instead. It reads `verify` and NOT `writes` — `writes` is key names only by stated
law, so nothing here can know the value an action would set. The marker is `alreadyTrue:
FilterCondition[]` on the fire result AND the row (presence is the mark, the value is the evidence:
one field, not a boolean beside a list), served by modes.ts on the fire result and the settled
`did_it_work` answer with one authored sentence. NOT stamped on an allowed-unmaterialized fire —
that fate already has `materialized: false`.

**Refusals teach, including the four that did not (1.12.0):** `TRANSITION_ID_REQUIRED`,
`ACTION_REQUIRED`, `KEY_REQUIRED` and `JOURNEY_REQUIRED` were raised as `{ok:false, judgment:'error',
reason}` and nothing else — no `why`, no correction, no valid set, not even `positionData()`. They
now meet the house standard: the argument named, the correction attached, the valid set carried
where one exists (`actions` / `journeys` from the same doors `UNKNOWN_ACTION` / `UNKNOWN_JOURNEY`
read; `pending` + `awaitingSettlement` + `awaitingHuman` from the same doors `UNKNOWN_TRANSITION`
reads), and honest silence where none does (`KEY_REQUIRED` — `why` runs a slice and never refuses a
key, so there IS no valid set). ADDITIVE: the four `reason` strings are unchanged, none grows a
singular `transitionId` (consent-invariant.test.ts sweeps for that), and no `openTransitions` was
minted — `awaitingSettlement` is already the word for fires still open, and a second name for one
fact is what answer-grammar rule 3 forbids. One in-repo `toEqual` pin was loosened deliberately
(one-journey-tool.test.ts) — it was the only exact-match assertion on the four.

**Position has three tiers, one door each (1.11.0):** page (`sync`) → container
(`observeFocus`, new) → state (`updateState`, not position). **Sync pages; observe the deeper place.
`sync()` moves the walker and decides what is served; `observeFocus()` says which tab or area the
reader is in. Declare containers, and report the deepest one on screen.** The middle door had to
exist: actions are served from the PAGE, so a cursor on a tab is served nothing (a container path to
`sync` now syncs its page and warns, naming `observeFocus` — before 1.11.0 it went off-graph
silently), and `focus` moved only on `fire()`/`sync()`, so a PERSON clicking a tab could never move
it. `observeFocus` (traverse/nav-session.ts) sets `focus` + the new `lookingAt` getter (served beside
`youAreOn` by modes.ts `positionData`), records a `FocusMove`, and touches NOTHING else — no
transition, no version bump, no change to `available()`. It refuses BY NAME: undeclared node, or a
node on another page. Three facts, three doors: `show()`/`setVisible()` = VISIBLE,
`observeFocus()` = the READER, `sync()` = the WALKER. Authored half lintable
(`unevidenceable-tab`, advisory); the runtime half no static check can see.

## Before you design it: it may already exist

**Read this table before proposing any new capability.** Everything below already ships.
The failure it exists to stop is real and expensive: a reader searches for the words THEY
would use, finds nothing, and designs a feature this library has had for releases. It
happened three times in one day — twice here. Someone proposed "bind actions by role and
name instead of CSS selectors", and `ElementLocator` had been exactly `{ role, name }`
since the first npm release. Someone proposed inventing a vocabulary for what moved the
cursor, and `Cause` + `Principal` had been sitting in the same file, one screen apart.
Each cost a design round.

Keyed by **what you would call it**, not by what it is called here. If your idea is not in
this table, search `src/index.ts` for the nearest noun before writing code.

| If you are about to build… | It is | Where | Since |
|---|---|---|---|

| working out why `did_it_work` keeps saying still-pending about an action whose effect was already true | `alreadyTrueNow` + `FireResult.alreadyTrue` (declare `verify` beside `writes`: `writes` is key names only, so nothing here can know the value your handler would set) | `src/traverse/already-true.ts` | 1.12.0 |
| working out what a bare `TRANSITION_ID_REQUIRED` / `ACTION_REQUIRED` / `KEY_REQUIRED` / `JOURNEY_REQUIRED` wanted — or getting a lost transition id back out of the port | the four now carry `why` + the valid set + the position (`awaitingSettlement` on the transition one; no `openTransitions` was minted) | `src/serve/modes.ts` | 1.12.0 |

**The honest limit, said plainly.** This table can go stale by OMISSION — nothing cheap
forces a new capability to add a row, so absence from it is weak evidence, and
`src/index.ts` remains the authority. What it can never do is LIE about what it names:
`test/docs/capability-index.test.ts` fails if any row points at a path that does not exist
or names a symbol that is not there. A row that has rotted is worse than no row, because
it costs the reader the same search plus a wrong turn.

**Maintaining it:** a new public capability adds a row. Phrase the first column as the
sentence someone would say who does not know the symbol exists — that is the whole
mechanism; a row keyed on the library's own noun is findable only by people who already
found it.

## Module map

Entry points: `hcifootprint` (authoring + session) · `/mcp` (the only place the MCP SDK is
imported) · `/sensor` · `/react` · `/testing` · `/testing/lint` (engine-free static lint).

| src/ | one job |
|---|---|
| atom/ | the domain types, layer 0. `Affordance = binding × guard × effect × schema`; `Transition = cause × payload × outcome`. No runtime code. |
| graph/ | the authoring spine every graph door throws through (guards, segments, routes) + `matchRoute`, `reach`, `step-deps`, and the growable `sources/` |
| tree/ | `buildNavigationGraph` — pages → areas / tabs / modals → actions, validated, frozen, plus the flat projection every other layer runs on |
| traverse/ | the driver. `Session` / `InteractionSession`: one settled transition → one fresh StageContext → one footprintjs `CommitBundle`, so `causalChain`/`sliceForKey` work with zero new query code |
| registry/ | what is wired RIGHT NOW: `affordanceId → the app's real handler`, in groups so unmount cleanup is one call |
| presence/ | refcounted mount handles + explicit visibility signals, as plain data. What presence MEANS lives one layer up |
| serve/ | LLM-facing emission: MCP descriptors, `serveToAgent` (journeys as fixed tools), the tool-name encoder |
| sensor/ | the record-only human sensor (`hcifootprint/sensor`). Zero-value-import leaf |
| react/ | a skin over the sensor — a context and two hooks, nothing else. The only folder naming `react` |
| contextful/ | one wrapper at registration, so both doors into an action land in the same capture envelope |
| testing/ | static `lintGraph`/`checkGraph`, dynamic `testApp`, and `conformSource` for adapter drift |

## Gates

```bash
npm run typecheck        # tsc --noEmit, plus the test tsconfig
npm test                 # vitest, then the posttest badge gate (README's count must match the run)
npm run docs:truth:check # does the shipped surface still have the docs the baseline recorded?
npm run build            # dist/, ESM-first — docs:truth reads dist, so build before it
```

The README states a test COUNT, and `scripts/check-test-badge.mjs` fails if the badge or
its alt text disagrees with the run. Adding tests means editing BOTH numbers in
`README.md` — a number nobody checks is not a fact.
