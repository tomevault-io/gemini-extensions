## opencheck

> Use **`python3`**, not `python`, in all documented commands and examples — macOS

# OpenCheck — development notes for Claude

## Local commands (macOS)

Use **`python3`**, not `python`, in all documented commands and examples — macOS
ships Python 3 as `python3` and has no bare `python` on the PATH (`python …`
fails with `command not found`). The same applies to any one-off scripts and the
test suite below.

## After every commit: post the local run commands

After making **any** git commit during a session, post (in the chat) the commands
the user needs to bring the stack up locally on the branch just committed to, so
they can test immediately. The workspace is mounted from the user's disk, so the
commits already exist locally — the user **checks out** the branch, they don't
fetch/pull from origin.

Template (fill in `<branch>`):

```
cd ~/code/opencheck
rm -f .git/*.lock 2>/dev/null            # clear any leftover sandbox lock files
git checkout <branch>

# Backend (one terminal):
cd backend && uv sync && uv run uvicorn opencheck.app:app --reload --port 8000

# Frontend (another terminal):
cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev
```

Notes to add when relevant: uvicorn `--reload` picks up backend changes
automatically, but the Vite dev server must be **restarted** to pick up new files
or `vite.config.ts` / `.env.local` changes; `.env.local` already proxies the API
to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`; `uv sync` / `npm install` are only needed when
dependencies changed but are harmless to run otherwise.

## Architecture overview

- **Backend**: FastAPI, split into `backend/opencheck/routers/` (health, search, lookup, export).
- **Frontend**: React + Tailwind, split into `frontend/src/components/` (icons, risk, export, cdd).
- **Sources**: each adapter lives in `backend/opencheck/sources/<name>.py`, registered in `sources/__init__.py`.
- **BODS mapping**: each adapter has a corresponding `map_<name>()` function in `bods/mapper.py`, exported from `bods/__init__.py`.

## Open Knowledge Format (OKF) bundle — `okf/`

OpenCheck ships an **[OKF v0.1](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/knowledge-catalog/blob/main/okf/SPEC.md)
knowledge bundle** at `okf/` — a directory of markdown files with YAML
frontmatter that lets humans and AI agents understand the project, its data
sources, the BODS/LEI standards, and the API. OKF is "metadata as code": every
concept has a required `type` field, cross-links are plain markdown links, and
`index.md` / `log.md` are reserved filenames (see the spec §3–§9).

Structure: `overview.md`, `architecture.md`, `glossary.md` (project);
`standards/` (BODS v0.4, LEI/GLEIF anchoring); `api/` (one concept per
endpoint); `sources/` (one **Data Source** concept per registered adapter);
`licensing/matrix.md`.

**Two halves:**

- **Hand-authored** narrative concepts (project / standards / api). Edit these by
  hand.
- **Auto-generated** from the live registry: `sources/*.md`, `sources/index.md`,
  `licensing/matrix.md`, `licensing/index.md`. **Do not hand-edit these** — they
  are produced by the generator below and pull `SourceInfo` + `licensing.classify`.

**Tooling (in `backend/scripts/`):**

- `generate_okf.py` — the "enrichment agent". Regenerates the auto concepts from
  the registry. `--check` validates OKF conformance **and** that the generated
  concepts are in sync with the registry (timestamp lines are ignored in the
  drift comparison). Run it (without `--check`) and commit after adding/changing
  a source.
- `generate_okf_viz.py` — renders the whole bundle to a self-contained
  `okf/viz.html` (Cytoscape graph + rendered markdown; CDN-loaded, no backend).
  Regenerate after editing concepts.

**CI:** `.github/workflows/vendored-enum-drift.yml` has an `okf` job that installs
the backend and runs `generate_okf.py --check`, so a stale bundle (e.g. a new
source not regenerated) fails the build — alongside the vendored-enum drift jobs.

## Phase 8 — Licensing & AuraDB deferral (recorded 2026-06-07)

### Demo data licences

The `data/demo/` graph is assembled from two freely-shareable published
BODS v0.4 datasets. The combined graph is freely usable in talks,
blog posts, and derivative works under the most restrictive of the two
licences, OGL v3.0:

| Dataset | Licence |
|---|---|
| UK PSC (Companies House via Open Ownership) | OGL v3.0 |
| GLEIF L1 + L2 (GLEIF via Open Ownership) | CC0 1.0 |

Both licences are permissive and compatible. OGL v3.0 requires
attribution; CC0 does not. Pipeline code
(`bods-uk-psc-pipeline`, `bods-gleif-pipeline`) is AGPL-3.0 but is
**not** included in OpenCheck — OpenCheck only reads their published
BODS output. No AGPL obligations apply to OpenCheck.

Full attribution wording and source URLs: `data/demo/LICENCES.md`.

### AuraDB / hosted Neo4j — explicitly parked

**Decision (2026-06-07):** Do **not** move to a hosted Neo4j AuraDB
instance or adopt any embedded graph DB (Kuzu, Memgraph, MemGQL) as a
dependency of OpenCheck's runtime at this time.

**Rationale:** The demo use-case (curated 9-entity set, one-off
build, slides + local Neo4j Docker) is fully served by the current
stack: SQLite extraction → BODS JSON-Lines → `bods-neo4j` CSV → local
Neo4j. Adding a hosted graph DB introduces cost, network dependency,
and operational complexity before any evidence that DuckDB + the
curated set cannot handle the traversal load.

**Named revisit trigger:** Revisit when either:
1. A user-facing traversal query (multi-hop UBO resolution in the live
   `/lookup` flow) measurably exceeds 2 s median latency on the
   full-entity BODS data **with** DuckDB, **or**
2. The demo set grows beyond ~200 anchor entities and
   `extract_bods_subgraphs.py` + in-memory dedup becomes a bottleneck.

Until one of those triggers fires, the architecture stays: SQLite
source-of-truth → BODS JSON-Lines → Neo4j Docker for demos only.

## Current state (Phase 46)

### National ID search (frontend-only, Phase 46)

Three-tab search panel: **Company name** | **National ID** | **Paste an LEI**.

The National ID tab lets users enter a local company registration number and
resolve it to a LEI via GLEIF reverse lookup, then run the full OpenCheck
lookup automatically.

Key files:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `frontend/src/lib/raCodes.ts` | RA codes, labels, placeholders, format regexes for 17 countries. Export: `RA_CODES`, `COUNTRY_OPTIONS`, `validateNationalId()` |
| `frontend/src/lib/gleifNationalId.ts` | `searchByNationalId(raCode, id)` — fires three GLEIF filter endpoints in parallel (`registeredAs`, `validatedAs`, `otherValidationAuthorities.validatedAs`), deduplicates by LEI |

How it works:
1. User selects country → country picker resolves to an RA code (e.g. GB → RA000585)
2. User enters registration number → `searchByNationalId()` queries all three GLEIF filter fields scoped to that RA code
3. Single result → auto-navigates to `/lookup-stream`; multiple results → picker; zero results → amber notice with "try by name" fallback

Format validation is advisory (non-blocking). The amber border + warning fires only after `onBlur` (`nationalIdTouched` state) so it doesn't interrupt typing. GLEIF may store IDs in a normalised form that differs from the raw input — always allow submission.

**Pure frontend change — no backend routes added or modified.**

---

## Current state (Phase 45)

**Test suite**: 1733 passed, 6 skipped, 5 xfailed. Run `python3 -m pytest` from `backend/`.

**Frontend graph renderer**: Cytoscape.js (replaced `@openownership/bods-dagre` in Phase 44). Component: `frontend/src/components/BODSGraph.tsx`. Uses a React HTML overlay layer for BOVS icons and flags — never use Cytoscape's `background-image` for icons (canvas taint from Adobe Illustrator `xmlns:xlink` SVGs). BOVS icons are base64 data URIs in `frontend/src/lib/bovsIcons.ts`. Flags are served from `frontend/public/bods-dagre-images/flags/`. The overlay recomputes on `cy.on('viewport')`. Flag badges are at 45° NE circumference; risk signal badges at 315° NW.

**Risk signal overlays**: BOVS Option C implemented. `buildSignalMap()` in BODSGraph.tsx reads `evidence.statement_id` (SANCTIONED/PEP), `evidence.subject_statement_id` (RELATED_*), `evidence.matches[].statement_id` (TRUST/AMLA), `evidence.jurisdictions[].statement_id` (FATF/NON_EU), `evidence.longest_path[]` (COMPLEX_OWNERSHIP_LAYERS). Single signal → labelled pill at 315° NW; multiple → "N ⚠" stack badge.

**Estonian adapter**: `ariregister.py` is now a public web scraper — `GET ariregister.rik.ee/eng/company/{reg}/company_print_json`. No credentials. The previous SOAP/X-Road approach (Phase 37) used `ariregxmlv6.rik.ee` with `ARIREGISTER_USERNAME`/`ARIREGISTER_PASSWORD` credentials from a paid RIK contract that turned out not to grant data access. Do NOT revert to SOAP. The HTML parser extracts officers (→ Estonian role codes), shareholders (person vs entity from ID code length), and BOs — Estonia's legitimate-interest access restriction was postponed on its 2026-07-10 start date, so BO data remains available (degradation for the eventual switch is pinned by `_HTML_BO_WITHDRAWN` tests). `map_ariregister()` in mapper.py is unchanged.

**GLEIF RA code for Estonia**: `RA000181` (confirmed from live GLEIF data — the CLAUDE.md table below has a typo: RA000198 is wrong, RA000181 is correct).

---

## Lookup architecture: ONE pipeline drives both /lookup and /lookup-stream (Phase 47)

`routers/lookup.py` has a single async generator, `_lookup_pipeline()`, that
resolves the GLEIF anchor, builds derived identifiers, dispatches adapters,
converts results to SourceHits, deepens and assesses risk. It yields
`(event, payload)` tuples; `/lookup-stream` serialises them as SSE and
`/lookup` collects them into a `LookupResponse`. The endpoints **cannot
diverge** — the old hand-synchronised sync/SSE copies (and the
Corporations Canada regression `603c086` they caused) are gone.

**Adapters are self-describing.** Each national-register adapter declares its
lookup wiring on its own class (see `sources/base.py`):

```python
class BrregAdapter(SourceAdapter):
    id = "brreg"
    lookup_derivers = (
        LookupDeriver(frozenset({NO_RA_CODE}), "no_orgnr", normalise_orgnr),
    )
    lookup_pass_legal_name = True
```

`routers/lookup.py` builds `_RA_DERIVERS` and `_REGISTRY_SOURCES` from the
REGISTRY at import time; an adapter that declares lookup keys without a
matching `_bh_<name>()` hit builder raises at import. Special cases:
`lookup_dispatch_keys` overrides the dispatch key when it is derived
elsewhere (rpvs_slovakia reuses rpo's `sk_ico`; companies_house uses the GB
jurisdiction special case). BODS mappers are found by convention —
`opencheck.bods.map_<source_id>` — there is no `_MAPPERS` dict.

`tests/test_lookup_pipeline.py` enforces all of this (deriver keys must have
dispatch specs, specs must match adapter declarations, mappers must exist,
missing builders fail fast) and pins sync/stream parity.
`tests/test_sources.py` discovers adapter modules from the filesystem — no
hand-maintained expected-source lists anywhere. Deliberately unregistered
bulk/offline adapters are allowlisted in `_DELIBERATELY_UNREGISTERED`.
LEI-keyed sources (opensanctions, openaleph, climatetrace, bods_gleif) and
SEC EDGAR are handled inside `_dispatch()` / `_lookup_pipeline()` directly.

### Cold start & per-source time budgets (Phase 47)

- The FastAPI lifespan kicks off `climatetrace.warm_caches()` in a
  background thread at startup, so Render cold starts pre-download/parse
  the GEM CSVs, GLEIF GEM↔LEI mapping and GEOT artifact before the first
  lookup. Warm-up failures are logged and non-fatal (lazy fallback).
  The climatetrace adapter's index builds run via `asyncio.to_thread` —
  never on the event loop.
- Every adapter has a `lookup_timeout_s` wall-clock budget (default 30 s,
  declared on the class). The pipeline cancels and emits a
  `source_error` with `error_type: "timeout"` when exceeded. Overrides:
  cvr_denmark 90 s (Datafordeler is slow by design), openaleph 60 s
  (strategy cascade). Budgets are capped sanity-tested in
  `tests/test_lookup_pipeline.py` (must be ≤ 120 s).

### OpenAleph: FtM /match step + mentions enrichment

- The OpenAleph strategy cascade is: leiCode → OC URL → registration
  numbers → **FtM `POST /api/2/match`** → free-text `q=` name fallback.
  The match step converts the subject to an FtM Company via
  `opencheck/ftm.py` — bods-ftm's `entity_statement_to_ftm()` when
  installed (the `ftm` extra; Docker + CI ship the ICU toolchain
  g++/libicu-dev/pkg-config that followthemoney → pyicu needs), else a
  built-in converter with parity-tested identical output. **Requires
  `OPENALEPH_API_KEY`** — the flagship edge 405s anonymous POSTs to
  /match even though the app route allows them; without the key the step
  is skipped silently.
- Match-acceptance gating in `match_entity()`: hits whose own properties
  corroborate a subject identifier (leiCode / registrationNumber /
  opencorporatesUrl) are always kept, flagged
  `raw["identifier_corroborated"]` and ranked first; others survive only
  at ≥ 25% of the top hit's score (relative — FtM/BM25 scores vary with
  name length/rarity, so never use absolute thresholds).
- Mentions enrichment (OpenAleph 5.3 `/entities/{id}/mentions`): top
  OpenAleph hits get "· mentioned in N documents" + `raw.openaleph_mentions`
  (title/collection/category/url per doc). Informational only — mentions
  are name-derived and never count as identifier corroboration.

### Replay cache, shareable URLs, per-source retry (Phase 47)

- Completed pipeline runs are cached in memory for 15 min
  (`_REPLAY_CACHE`, keyed `LEI:deepen_top`, 64 entries max) and replayed by
  both endpoints; `?refresh=true` bypasses. Only runs that reach `done` are
  cached. Tests must not leak cache entries across fixtures — a conftest.py
  autouse fixture clears it around every test.
- `GET /lookup-source?lei=&source_id=` re-runs one source (per-source retry
  in the UI) via `_resolve_ctx()` + `_dispatch(ctx, only=...)`, and
  invalidates the replay cache for that LEI.
- Frontend: lookups are addressable via `?lei=` (pushState + popstate
  handling in App.tsx — query param, not a path, so no static-host rewrite
  rules needed). A mid-stream connection drop after `gleif_done` keeps
  partial results and shows a "Resume lookup" banner; failed source cards
  get a "Retry source" button wired to `/lookup-source`.

### Checklist for a new adapter

- [ ] `sources/<name>.py` — adapter class with `lookup_derivers` /
      `lookup_pass_legal_name` declared on the class
- [ ] `sources/schemas/<name>.py` — Pydantic bundle schema
- [ ] `sources/__init__.py` — import + REGISTRY entry
- [ ] `bods/mapper.py` — `map_<name>()` function (+ `bods/__init__.py` export)
- [ ] `routers/lookup.py` — `_bh_<name>()` hit builder (only this)
- [ ] `tests/test_<name>.py` — adapter + mapper tests
- [ ] `.env` — API key if required (never committed)
- [ ] `README.md` + `ATTRIBUTIONS.md` — document the source
- [ ] `docs/sources.md` — add the adapter row (keep it in sync with `REGISTRY`;
      the active table = `REGISTRY` minus env-gated bulk-only adapters), and
      refresh the source counts in `README.md` (intro paragraph + adapter-table
      pointer line) and the social card `opencheck-social-b.html`
- [ ] **Frontend homepage source count** — bump the "N sources" copy in
      `frontend/src/App.tsx`: the hero subline ("…from N sources into one
      graph…") **and** the "How it works" step-3 title ("N open sources, in
      parallel"). Easy to miss — these are hard-coded counts separate from the
      README/social-card ones.
- [ ] **Regenerate the OKF bundle** — run `python3 backend/scripts/generate_okf.py`
      and `python3 backend/scripts/generate_okf_viz.py`, then commit the resulting
      `okf/` changes **in the same commit as the adapter**. The CI `okf` job runs
      `generate_okf.py --check` and fails on drift, so a new/changed source that
      isn't regenerated breaks the build (this is what broke the four commits after
      `malta_mbr`). `--check` ignores the `timestamp:` line, so restore the
      timestamp on otherwise-unchanged source concepts to avoid committing pure
      churn — only `sources/<name>.md` (new), `sources/index.md`,
      `licensing/matrix.md` and `viz.html` should carry real changes.

## Available skills

Two Cowork skills are available and should be used proactively:

- **`/beneficial-ownership-data`** — use for any questions about beneficial ownership data, policy, registers, the BODS standard, FATF, EU AML, GLEIF→BODS mapping, OpenOwnership, or BO data in procurement/extractives.
- **`/gleif-data`** — use for any questions about LEIs, the GLEIF registry, LEI issuers (LOUs), registration authorities, ownership relationships in GLEIF, or LEI statistics. Has live access to the GLEIF API and Statistics MCP servers.

---

## Identifier corroboration rule for `SourceHit.identifiers`

When building a `SourceHit` in `routers/lookup.py`, only include an identifier in `identifiers` if the source **independently publishes or validates** that identifier. The reconciler (`reconcile.py`) uses the presence of an identifier across multiple hits to assert cross-source corroboration — putting a borrowed identifier on a hit that doesn't actually contain it creates a false confirmation in the UI.

Specific rules:

- **`wikidata_qid`** — only on the **Wikidata** hit. Companies House and GLEIF do not publish Wikidata mappings; omitting it from their hits was fixed in commits `3454a36` and `fbc458e`.
- **`lei`** — only on hits from sources that independently publish or validate LEIs (e.g. GLEIF, OpenCorporates). Do not propagate `lei` from the derived dict to registry adapters (CH, KvK, etc.) that received it as a lookup key rather than asserting it themselves.
- When in doubt: if the source's own data payload doesn't contain the identifier, don't put it in `identifiers`.

---

## Other conventions

- **Every new phase row in `docs/status.md` must end with a commit citation**
  — `Commit \`hash\`.` or `Commits \`a\`, \`b\`.` (short hashes in backticks).
  The `/changelog` page derives its GitHub links from exactly this clause
  (`extractCommits` in `frontend/src/lib/changelog.ts`); a row without it
  renders on the changelog with no link. Phases 68–70 dropped the
  convention and lost their links (restored in `6ecc723`).
- API keys go in `.env` only — never committed to the repo.
- Schema files use `extra="allow"` via `_Base` so unknown API fields don't break validation.
- `validate_raw()` is called at the end of `fetch()` on the fully-assembled bundle, before returning.
- BODS interest type for **directors/managing officials** is `seniorManagingOfficial`, not `appointmentOfBoard`.
- `appointmentOfBoard` is for right-to-appoint-and-remove style ownership interests.

---

## Deployment

- Backend is deployed on **Render** (https://api.opencheck.world). Environment variables (API keys, etc.) must be set in the Render dashboard as well as in `.env` for local development.
- Frontend is served separately. The backend CORS origin is configured via `OPENCHECK_CORS_ORIGIN` in `.env`.
- Render free-tier instances spin down when idle — the first request after inactivity may be slow.

---

## Frontend: BODSGraph (Cytoscape.js)

**Do not use `@openownership/bods-dagre`** — it was removed in Phase 44. The graph is now pure Cytoscape.js + `cytoscape-dagre`.

**Icon rendering**: BOVS entity/person icons are in `frontend/src/lib/bovsIcons.ts` as base64 data URIs (9 icons). They are rendered in a React HTML overlay (`position: absolute, pointerEvents: none`) above the Cytoscape canvas. The canvas background-image approach does NOT work for these SVGs because Adobe Illustrator export includes `xmlns:xlink` which causes browsers to silently refuse drawing on a tainted canvas.

**Flag rendering**: Country flags served from `/bods-dagre-images/flags/{code}.svg`. Applied in the same HTML overlay as icons. Flag badge position: 45° NE circumference — `(cx + r·cos45°, cy − r·sin45°)`. Badge size: proportional to node radius (0.75r × 0.50r).

**Signal badge rendering**: BOVS Option C risk overlays at 315° NW circumference — `(cx − r·cos45°, cy − r·sin45°)`. Single signal: labelled pill. Multiple signals: stack badge "N ⚠" in worst-severity colour. Signal→statementId mapping via `buildSignalMap()` which reads evidence fields.

**Overlay update**: `cy.on('viewport', updateOverlays)` fires on every pan/zoom. All coordinates computed in screen-space pixels.

**Edge styling**: All styled clones (`.own`/`.control`) from bods-dagre were removed. Arrowheads injected via custom SVG marker `#oc-bovs-arrow` in SVG `<defs>`.

**BOVS arrowhead marker**: injected after draw() — `<marker id="oc-bovs-arrow" viewBox="0 0 10 10" refX="9" refY="5" markerUnits="strokeWidth" markerWidth="8" markerHeight="6" orient="auto"><path d="M 0 0 L 10 5 L 0 10 z" fill="#333"/></marker>`. Applied to all `g.edgePath path` elements.

**Edge categories**: `ownership` (blue #1565c0), `control` (orange #e65100), `role` (purple #6a1b9a, dashed), `unknown` (grey #888).

---

## Frontend: Risk signal system

**`frontend/src/components/risk/RiskChip.tsx`**: `RISK_PRESENTATION` maps signal codes to `{label, classes}`. `CONFIDENCE_DOT`: `high`=`●`, `medium`=`◐`, `low`=`○`.

**Signal codes and colours** (bg / text):
- `SANCTIONED`, `RELATED_SANCTIONED` → rose (#ffe4e6 / #be123c)
- `FATF_BLACK_LIST` → red (#fee2e2 / #991b1b)
- `PEP`, `RELATED_PEP` → violet (#f5f3ff / #6d28d9)
- `COMPLEX_CORPORATE_STRUCTURE` → red (#fef2f2 / #b91c1c)
- `FATF_GREY_LIST` → orange dark (#fff7ed / #9a3412)
- `NON_EU_JURISDICTION` → orange (#fff7ed / #c2410c)
- `OFFSHORE_LEAKS` → amber (#fef3c7 / #92400e)
- `TRUST_OR_ARRANGEMENT` → indigo (#eef2ff / #4338ca)
- `COMPLEX_OWNERSHIP_LAYERS` → sky (#f0f9ff / #0369a1)

**Signal→BODS node mapping** (evidence fields):
- `SANCTIONED`, `PEP` → `evidence.statement_id` (added in Phase 45 via `_bods_stable_id(source_id, hit_id)` in `risk.py`)
- `RELATED_SANCTIONED`, `RELATED_PEP` → `evidence.subject_statement_id`
- `TRUST_OR_ARRANGEMENT`, `NOMINEE`, AMLA composites → `evidence.matches[].statement_id`
- `NON_EU_JURISDICTION`, `FATF_BLACK_LIST`, `FATF_GREY_LIST` → `evidence.jurisdictions[].statement_id`
- `COMPLEX_OWNERSHIP_LAYERS` → `evidence.longest_path[]` (array of statementIds)

**`SourceBucketCard`** passes `detail.risk_signals` to `<BODSGraph signals={...} />`.

## Datafordeler CVR API (Denmark) — hard-won constraints

These are non-obvious and cost significant debugging time. Do not deviate from them.

- **Endpoint**: `https://graphql.datafordeler.dk/CVR/v2` — the `v` prefix is mandatory; `CVR/2` returns 404.
- **Auth**: `?apiKey=<raw_key>` query parameter only. No base64 encoding, no `service_user_id`, no `Authorization` header. The config field is `cvr_denmark_api_key`.
- **DAF-GQL-0008**: Aliases are forbidden. Every field must be queried by its canonical name.
- **DAF-GQL-0010**: Only one root field per GraphQL operation. A single query cannot fetch `CVR_Navn` and `CVR_Adressering` together — each must be a separate HTTP request.
- Consequence of DAF-GQL-0008/0010: the adapter issues **6 sequential/parallel HTTP requests** per lookup (one virksomhed lookup + 5 detail queries run via `asyncio.gather`).
- **sekvens field**: `sekvens=0` is the primary/current record for names and branches. Higher values (1, 2…) are secondary or historical. Always prefer `sekvens==0`.
- **Legal form text**: Use the API's own `vaerdiTekst` field first; fall back to the hardcoded `_LEGAL_FORM_MAP` only when `vaerdiTekst` is absent. The map's numeric codes do not match what the API returns for many entities.
- **Address preference**: The `AdresseringAnvendelse` field value for the primary business address is `"beliggenhedsadresse"` (lowercase). Use case-insensitive matching: `"beliggenhed" in (val or "").lower()`.
- **Timeout**: The Datafordeler API is slow. All CVR `client.post()` calls must use `timeout=45.0` explicitly, overriding the global 15 s read timeout in `http.py`.
- **GLEIF RA code for Denmark**: `RA000170` (Erhvervsstyrelsen/CVR).

---

## KvK (Netherlands) — rate limit handling

- The KvK open-data endpoint returns HTTP 429 when the global rate limit is hit.
- The shared `httpx.AsyncHTTPTransport(retries=2)` only retries on network errors, not HTTP 4xx responses.
- The adapter handles 429 with an explicit retry loop: up to `_MAX_RETRIES=3` retries, honouring the `Retry-After` response header when present, otherwise using exponential backoff starting at 2 s (capped at 30 s).

---

## INPI (France) — legal publishing prohibition

**Security constraint — must never be relaxed.**

INPI entries where `beneficiaireEffectif == True` MUST be silently skipped and never included in any output, BODS statements, or API responses. This is required by French law (Loi Sapin II / décret 2017-1094), which prohibits republishing beneficial ownership data from the INPI register. Always check this flag before processing any INPI record.

---

## Estonian adapter (ariregister) — hard-won constraints

**SOAP/X-Road API at `ariregxmlv6.rik.ee` — read-only history queries are now ALLOWED (narrowed ban).** The original blanket ban was written for the Phase 37 *paid* contract, which authenticated (HTTP 200) but returned zero rows for every query (RIK confirmed that contract type didn't grant data access). That premise is now false: the **free open-data API contract** credentials obtained 2026-05-29 (`ARIREGISTER_USERNAME` / `ARIREGISTER_PASSWORD`) **do** return data. Confirmed live via `scripts/spike_ariregister_history.py` (Bolt returned 744 dated rows + a 50-entry registry-card log).

- **The live `/lookup` still uses the no-auth public scraper** in `fetch()` (see below) — do NOT route the lookup through SOAP.
- **The Time Machine (history only) uses SOAP**, read-only: `AriregisterAdapter.fetch_timeline_data()` calls `detailandmed_v2` (`ainult_kehtivad=0`, full registry-card history) + `tegelikudKasusaajad_v2` (beneficial-owner history), and `timeline/ariregister.py` maps the dated blocks into `ChangeEvent`s (NZ-emitter shape; `DateBasis.EFFECTIVE`/`HIGH`). Endpoint: `https://ariregxmlv6.rik.ee/`, producer namespace `http://arireg.x-road.eu/producer/`.
- **JSON dates are epoch-second floats and `{}` means "no end"** — the emitter requests XML (ISO dates, self-closing empties) for deterministic parsing; the epoch path is handled defensively in `_iso()`.
- **Shareholders are on the register card since 1 Sept 2023** (roles `OSAN` on-card / `O` off-card), so ownership history is available via `detailandmed_v2`.
- **BO access restriction POSTPONED on its 2026-07-10 start date** (https://news.err.ee/1610074816/ — the Ministry of Finance is revising the draft regulation; current public access remains, no new date announced). BO events stay deliberately isolated in `_bo_events()` in `timeline/ariregister.py` so the whole branch can be dropped when the restriction eventually lands (issues #22/#28 track it; a first removal shipped in `77e7b65` and was reverted when the postponement was announced — the revert commit shows exactly what to re-apply).
- **Render**: the Time Machine Estonia branch only lights up when `ARIREGISTER_USERNAME` / `ARIREGISTER_PASSWORD` are set on Render (in addition to `.env` locally). Without them, `fetch_timeline_data()` returns `None` and the timeline silently omits Estonian events.

**Current lookup approach (Phase 45)**: Public web scraper. No credentials needed.
- **Main endpoint**: `GET https://ariregister.rik.ee/eng/company/{reg_code}/company_print_json`
- **Search endpoint**: `GET https://ariregister.rik.ee/eng/api/autocomplete?q={query}` → JSON
- **GLEIF RA code**: `RA000181` (NOT RA000198 — the table below has a typo, RA000181 is confirmed from live GLEIF data)
- **HTML structure**: Bootstrap label/value rows (`col-md-4 text-muted` / `col font-weight-bold`). Tables identified by header keywords.
- **Officer role mapping**: English labels → Estonian codes (e.g. "Management board member" → `JUHL`, "Procurist" → `PROK`, "Liquidator" → `LIKV`)
- **Person type detection**: 11-digit code starting with 3-6 = natural person (F); 8-digit = legal entity (J)
- **BO control mapping**: "Indirect ownership" → `K`, "Direct ownership" → `O`, "Voting rights" → `H`
- **Not found detection**: If `str(r.url)` does not contain `/eng/company/`, the server redirected away (company not found) → return stub bundle
- **Bundle format**: Unchanged from Phase 37 — `map_ariregister()` in `bods/mapper.py` needs no changes
- `ARIREGISTER_USERNAME` / `ARIREGISTER_PASSWORD` are NOT used by the live-lookup scraper, but ARE read by `fetch_timeline_data()` for the SOAP history path (see the narrowed-ban note above)

## Frontend curated examples (App.tsx)

`EXAMPLE_LEIS` in `frontend/src/App.tsx` contains pre-computed `signals` arrays shown on the picker cards before the user clicks. These must be kept in sync with what the risk engine actually produces for each entity. When the risk engine changes (new signals, retired signals, confidence changes), update `EXAMPLE_LEIS` to match.

Current signal inventory used in picker cards: `TRUST_OR_ARRANGEMENT`, `COMPLEX_OWNERSHIP_LAYERS`, `COMPLEX_CORPORATE_STRUCTURE`, `SANCTIONED`, `RELATED_SANCTIONED`, `NON_EU_JURISDICTION`. Confidence `"high"` renders as `●`, `"medium"` as `◐`.

---

## Test suite

- **1733 passed, 6 skipped, 5 xfailed** as of Phase 45. Run `python3 -m pytest` from `backend/`.
- Async adapter tests use `pytest-asyncio` with `asyncio_mode = "auto"` (set in `pyproject.toml`).
- HTTP mocking: use `respx` for httpx-based adapters; use `unittest.mock.AsyncMock` with `patch("...build_client", ...)` for adapters that call `build_client()` directly.
- GraphQL adapters (CVR): mock by inspecting the request body (`request.content`) to route different query strings to different fixture responses.
- Always check `tests/test_sources.py` (expected registry set) and `tests/test_app.py` (expected `/sources` endpoint set) when adding a new adapter — both require explicit entries.
- **Live smoke tier (`tests/test_live_smoke.py`, `@pytest.mark.live`):** opt-in tests that hit the *real* GLEIF + Wikidata APIs to catch API-shape drift without recording payloads (the deliberate alternative to vcrpy/cassettes — no PII, secrets or licence-restricted data committed). **Skipped by default**; run with `pytest --run-live -m live` (or `OPENCHECK_RUN_LIVE=1`). The skip wiring is in `conftest.py` (`pytest_addoption` + `pytest_collection_modifyitems`); the `live` marker is registered in `pyproject.toml`. Only open, key-free sources belong here — never OpenSanctions (CC-BY-NC), OpenCorporates, or key-gated/PII-heavy sources.

## Spikes → production: test before you merge (hard-won, recorded 2026-06-26)

A **spike** is exploratory, throwaway-quality code to validate an idea fast (e.g.
the progressive-discovery / "Add next layer" graph expansion — destined for
**FullCheck** mode; see the QuickCheck/FullCheck Notion ticket). Spikes are
useful, but **merging a spike to `main` is moving it into production**, and that
has repeatedly outrun its test coverage here. Be conservative and surface the
gaps before promoting one.

- **Test every layer that changed, and make sure CI runs those tests.** Backend
  changes need pytest; frontend changes need `tsc` + the vitest suite. CI gates
  push/PR via `.github/workflows/tests.yml` (backend `pytest`, frontend
  `npm run build` + `npm test`) — a change that touches React/TS but only has
  backend tests is **not** production-ready. The sandbox can't run vitest
  (platform-mismatched `node_modules`); that is **not** the same as CI running
  it, so don't treat "tsc clean locally" as sufficient — confirm CI is green.
- **Unit fixtures are not enough — exercise it against real data before declaring
  it done.** The progressive-discovery spike passed every test yet was wrong on
  live Shell data three times (expansion direction; cross-source duplicate
  subjects; an empty frontier) because those were data-shape failures fixtures
  didn't capture.
- **Don't let `SPIKE` / `TODO` shortcuts cross into `main` unguarded.** If they
  must, open a tracked "de-spike" ticket *before* merging and link it in the
  merge commit.
- **Prefer a `--no-ff` merge that names the spike** so the debt is visible in
  history, and keep general fixes that rode along (e.g. dev-proxy additions, the
  StrictMode hit dedup) as their own commits so they're easy to find and port.
- **If asked to merge a spike to `main`, say what testing is still missing first**
  rather than merging silently.

## GLEIF reverse-lookup: local ID → LEI

GLEIF supports querying by local identifier, which is the **inverse** of OpenCheck's normal
flow (LEI → `registeredAs` → national adapter). This isn't needed for the core lookup path,
but would enable a future "company number first" entry point where a user supplies a local
registry number instead of a LEI.

A local ID may appear in **three** different fields on the LEI record:

| GLEIF field path | Filter parameter |
|---|---|
| `entity.registeredAs` | `filter[entity.registeredAs]=<id>` |
| `registration.validatedAs` | `filter[registration.validatedAs]=<id>` |
| `registration.otherValidationAuthorities.validatedAs` | `filter[registration.otherValidationAuthorities.validatedAs]=<id>` |

The same entity can hold different local IDs across those fields (e.g. a national registry
code vs. a tax authority code). To avoid false matches from coincidental ID collisions across
registries, always add the RA code as a second filter:

```
https://api.gleif.org/api/v1/lei-records?filter[entity.registeredAs]=00102498&filter[entity.registeredAt]=RA000585
```

Each adapter in the RA table below has the correct RA code for this second filter.

**Future use**: a "find by company number" entry flow would query all three filter endpoints
(parallel requests, deduplicate by LEI), then hand the resolved LEI to the standard
`/lookup-stream` flow. The RA codes table already has everything needed.

**Autocompletions endpoint**: `https://api.gleif.org/api/v1/autocompletions?field=fulltext&q=<name>`
searches across the entire LEI record (not just legalName). Likely a superset of the existing
`filter[fulltext]` search used in `gleif.py`; worth evaluating if name search miss-rate is a problem.

## BODS mapper key conventions

- `_stable_id(*parts)` — deterministic SHA-256-based ID; format `"opencheck-" + 24 hex chars`. Used as both `statementId` and `recordId` for entity/person statements.
- `make_entity_statement()`, `make_person_statement()`, `make_relationship_statement()` — factory functions in `mapper.py`. Always use these; never hand-build BODS statements.
- `_source_block(source_id, url)` — builds the `source` field. Every source_id must be in the `source_names` dict in mapper.py (6 were missing, fixed in Phase 43).
- `_official_registers` set in mapper.py — source IDs that get `"type": ["officialRegister"]` instead of `"thirdParty"]`.
- Relationship statements: `statementId != recordId` (unlike entity/person where they're equal).
- Risk signal `statement_id` in evidence: `_bods_stable_id(source_id, hit_id)` — added to SANCTIONED/PEP evidence in `risk.py` in Phase 45 so frontend can look up which node to overlay.
