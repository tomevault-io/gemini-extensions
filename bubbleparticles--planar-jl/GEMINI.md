# Developer Notes

## Getting Started

Before running or developing the bot, or executing the test suite locally, ensure the environment variables from the project's `.envrc` are loaded. The `.envrc` sets critical variables used by tests and the development environment (JULIA_PROJECT, JULIA_LOAD_PATH, JULIA_CONDAPKG_ENV, etc.).

**To load .envrc locally (recommended):**

- Use direnv: run `direnv allow` in the repository root to automatically load .envrc into your shell.
- Or source the file manually: `source .envrc`.

Failing to load .envrc may cause missing package errors during test runs (e.g., packages installed into user/.conda, missing JULIA_PROJECT), unexpected precompilation behavior, or other environment-dependent failures.

Include this check in your developer workflow before running `julia --project=PlanarDev test` or `julia --project=PlanarDev PlanarDev/test/runtests.jl`.

**When using `timeout` on Julia commands**, always use the `-k` (kill-after) flag to ensure the process is fully terminated. Julia's precompilation may spawn background threads that outlive the main process. Example:

```bash
timeout -k 30 300 julia --project=PlanarDev test/runtests.jl
```

---

## Development Tools

### DaemonMode.jl

**Do NOT launch a new `julia` process for every single check, test, or REPL snippet.** Julia's startup time is significant and launching fresh processes repeatedly wastes time and causes redundant precompilation.

Instead, use DaemonMode.jl to keep a persistent Julia daemon running:

```bash
# Start the daemon once (in background)
julia --project=PlanarDev -e 'using DaemonMode; run_daemon()' &

# Send commands to the daemon (fast, no startup overhead)
DaemonMode.runargs("PlanarDev", "-e", "using Pkg; Pkg.resolve()")
DaemonMode.runargs("PlanarDev", "-e", "include(\"PlanarDev/test/test_aqua.jl\")")

# Stop the daemon when done
DaemonMode.stop_daemon()
```

For interactive work, use `DaemonMode.repl_connect()` to attach to the running daemon instead of launching a new REPL. See `.agents/skills/daemon-mode.sh` for usage patterns.

### resolve.jl Utilities

The repository provides a `resolve.jl` helper that includes utilities for dependency management and cache cleanup. In particular, the `purge_compilecache` utility in resolve.jl can be used to clear Julia's compiled cache and help resolve precompilation or stale-artifact issues. The same resolve.jl file also contains helpers to update and synchronize project package dependencies across the repository; use these utilities when dependency resolution or precompilation problems arise.

### Python Gateway Test Suite

The ccxt-gateway has its own Python test suite in `./ccxt-gateway/tests/`. Use the `.venv` to run it:

```bash
cd ./ccxt-gateway && .venv/bin/pytest
```

The Julia Ccxt package tests (part of the PlanarCore suite, `./PlanarCore/test/Ccxt/`) are run via:

```bash
cd ./PlanarCore && julia --project=. -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.test()'
```

## Ccxt to CcxtGateway Migration

When working on migrating from Python ccxt bindings to CcxtGateway:

### Architecture Overview

The migration produces a two-layer architecture:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Downstream packages (ExchangeTypes, etc.)  │
│  - Specific CCXT methods (fetch_ticker...)  │
│  - Use call_exchange() to talk to gateway   │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Ccxt module (exchange_funcs.jl)            │
│  - choosefunc, _multifunc, _out_as_input    │
│  - exchange_has (with TTL cache)            │
│  - get_cached_has, issupported              │
│  - ccxt_exchange_names                      │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  CcxtGateway module (CcxtGateway/)          │
│  - GatewayClient / GatewayWSClient          │
│  - ping, call_exchange, exchange_has        │
│  - start/stop_exchange, spawn/stop_gateway  │
│  - fetch_exchange_has (raw HTTP)            │
│  - WebSocket subscribe/unsubscribe          │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  ccxt-gateway (Python process)              │
│  - FastAPI REST + WebSocket server          │
│  - Manages exchange subprocesses            │
│  - Auto-idle shutdown (default 5 min)       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Refactoring Strategy

**New approach (as of 2026-05-08):**
- **Old (Python-based) functions** get `_python` suffix (e.g., `fetch_ticker_python`)
- **New (CcxtGateway-based) functions** keep the original names (e.g., `fetch_ticker`)
- This is the opposite of the previous approach which suffixed new functions with `_gateway`

This makes the CcxtGateway functions the default, while keeping Python fallbacks available with explicit `_python` suffix.

### Calling CCXT Methods

CcxtGateway does NOT implement specific CCXT methods. Downstream packages should:

```julia
# Instead of fetch_ticker(client, "binance", symbol="BTC/USDT")
call_exchange(client, "binance", "fetch_ticker", query=Dict("symbol" => "BTC/USDT"))
```

The `call_exchange` function:
- Automatically retries if the subprocess has crashed (gateway restarts it)
- Routes GET/POST based on method type (POST for createOrder, cancelOrder, withdraw)
- Returns the parsed JSON result

### Exchange Method Support (has dict)

Use `exchange_has()` to check if an exchange supports a method:

```julia
if Ccxt.exchange_has("binance", "fetchOHLCV")
    # OK to call
end
```

The has dict is cached with a **5-minute TTL** (`HAS_CACHE_TTL = 300.0` in `exchange_funcs.jl`). After expiry, the next call re-fetches from the gateway.

To bypass the cache and force a fresh fetch, access `CcxtGateway.fetch_exchange_has(client, id)` directly.

### Gateway Lifecycle

**Auto-detection on `using Ccxt`:**
- `_init()` checks `/tmp/ccxt_gateway.pid` for a running gateway
- If alive: adopts the PID, no spawn needed
- If stale: removes the pidfile, spawns a new gateway
- If no pidfile: pings `localhost:8999`, spawns if unreachable

**Idempotent exchange start:**
- `start_exchange` stores exchange IDs in `_started_exchanges` dict
- Starting an already-started exchange returns `Dict("status" => "already_started", ...)` 
- `stop_exchange` removes from the dict

**Gateway auto-shutdown:**
- The gateway tracks its last request time
- If idle for 5+ minutes (configurable), it shuts down and removes its pidfile

**PID file:** `/tmp/ccxt_gateway.pid`

### Error Handling

```julia
# Check if an exception is ccxt-related
if isccxterror(e)
    @warn "CCXT error: $e"
end

# Get list of ccxt error names
errors = get_ccxt_errors()  # fetched from gateway, cached
```

### choosefunc Implementation

`choosefunc` and `_multifunc` are implemented in `exchange_funcs.jl` for gateway use:

```julia
# Automatically selects fetchTicker vs fetchTickers based on exchange support
result = choosefunc("binance", "Ticker", ["BTC/USDT", "ETH/USDT"])
```

The method selection priority: `fetchSuffixsWs` > `fetchSuffixs` > `fetchSuffixWs` > `fetchSuffix`.

### Guidelines

1. **Keep Code Logic AS IS**: Do NOT make arbitrary simplifications or rewrites to the code logic. The original Python ccxt bindings were carefully designed, and changing the logic can introduce bugs.

2. **JSON Values, Not Python Objects**: Remember that the responses we process now come from JSON (via JSON3.jl) rather than Python objects. This means:
   - Types like `Py`, `pyanything`, `pyNone`, `pynothing` are replaced by standard Julia types
   - Access patterns like `py.x` become `obj["x"]` for JSON dicts
   - Type conversions like `pyconvert(T, x)` become appropriate JSON parsing
   - JSON3.Object is NOT a `Dict` — use `isa Union{Dict, JSON3.Object}` for type checks

3. **Incremental Changes**: Make small, testable changes. After each change, run the test suite or relevant tests to verify the change works correctly.

4. **API Compatibility**: When creating a compatibility layer, ensure the API matches what the original code expects - do not change function signatures or behavior.

5. **No Shortcuts**: Do not try to "simplify" code without understanding what it does. If you're unsure about a piece of code, ask before modifying it.

6. **Refactoring Process**:
   - First, rename existing Python-based functions with `_python` suffix
   - Add new CcxtGateway-based functions with original names
   - Mirror them 1:1 in logic to the Python versions
   - Check `PlanarDev/test/` for existing test files related to the package and move/adapt them into the package's own `test/` directory
   - Build/update the package's test suite with pure unit tests (data conversion, helpers) and mock-HTTP integration tests using `Rest.set_http_get!/set_http_post!/set_http_delete!`
   - Remove `_python` functions only when fully migrated and tested

7. **Use `call_exchange` for CCXT methods**: Do not add specific `fetch_*` functions to CcxtGateway. Downstream packages call them via `call_exchange(client, id, method, query=...)`.

8. **Has cache: always set a TTL**: Any cache added to the Ccxt module must have a TTL. The exchange has dict cache uses 5 minutes.

9. **Mock HTTP in tests**: Use `Rest.set_http_get!/set_http_post!/set_http_delete!` to inject mock HTTP functions. The `Ref{Function}` pattern allows swapping without changing function signatures.

10. **Subprocess crash recovery**: The gateway auto-restarts crashed exchange subprocesses. The Julia side doesn't need retry logic — `call_exchange` will wait for the restart and retry the request.

11. **Audit ALL files in the package, not just the "important" ones**: Grep for Python/ccxt references across every `.jl` file in the package before declaring migration done. A `precompile.jl` that's conditionally included is easy to miss.

12. **Verify every function body survives edit surgery**: After every large deletion, search for every name referenced in error messages and confirm its definition still exists. Use e.g. `rg "^function name|^name\s*="` to verify.

13. **Check file include order before moving includes**: When adding a new `include(...)` to a module file, read the full contents of the included file first — it may reference types defined in other includes. The wrong order breaks compilation.

14. **Test with normal precompilation, not just `--compiled-modules=no`**: `--compiled-modules=no` skips `precompile.jl` entirely, hiding errors that only surface during real precompilation. Run at least one test with cached precompilation too.

15. **Every watcher Val type needs a `_process!` override**: When a watcher type lacks a `_process!` override and `_init!` sets the view to `nothing`, the generic `default_process` crashes with `DataAPI.nrow(nothing)`. Always ensure every watcher Val type has either a no-op `_process!(::Watcher, ::Val{:myval}) = nothing` or a proper processing pipeline via `default_process(w, my_append_func)`.

16. **Implement the test suite during refactoring, aiming for maximum coverage**: Before starting, search `PlanarDev/test/` for existing test files related to the package being refactored. After migration, create a `test/runtests.jl` with pure unit tests (data conversion, helpers) and mock-HTTP integration tests. Use `Rest.set_http_get!/set_http_post!/set_http_delete!` to mock gateway endpoints — see `Exchanges/test/runtests_fast.jl` for the pattern. The full setup workflow:
    - Create `test/Project.toml` with **no** `name`/`uuid`/`version`/`authors` header (just `[deps]` and optionally `[compat]`)
    - Use `Pkg.develop` for all local transitive deps + the package under test, `Pkg.add` for public test-only deps
    - In `test/runtests.jl`, set up mock HTTP handlers before constructing any exchange — the `else` catch-all branch should return `nothing` for unknown endpoints
    - For endpoint-specific test data (currency tiers, market limits, sandbox mode), add explicit `occursin` branches before the catch-all
    - Seed exchange markets manually (`exc.markets["SYM"] = Dict{String,Any}(...)`) and push types (`push!(exc.types, :swap)`) to avoid gateway calls for market metadata
    - Use the inner constructor `AssetInstance(a, data, exc, margin; limits, precision, fees)` to bypass gateway-dependent outer constructors
    - Verify with `julia --project=<pkg> -e "import Pkg; Pkg.test()"` from the repo root — this catches environment mismatches that direct `include` invocations miss

17. **Coverage requirement: ≥80%, ideally >95%**: Every package must maintain at least 80% line coverage, with a target of >95%. Untested code is a liability — the gateway migration changes the data path (JSON3 vs Python objects, `body=` vs `query=`, `params` dict wrapping), and without coverage, regressions slip through. Use mock-HTTP (`Rest.set_http_get!/set_http_post!`) to test gateway-dependent code paths without spawning a live gateway. Pure unit tests cover data conversion, helper functions, and edge cases. Measure coverage with `julia --project=. -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.add("CoverageTools")'` and the `coverage --run` workflow.

18. **Test via `Pkg.test()` as the canonical invocation**: The standard Julia convention is `julia --project=<pkg> -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.test()'`. Keep the test suite runnable this way — it catches environment mismatches that direct `include` invocations miss. Ensure `test/Project.toml` has no `name`/`uuid`/`version`/`authors` header (those fields cause Pkg to treat the test project as a real package, fail precompilation with "Missing source file", and prevent `Pkg.test()` from succeeding).

19. **Minimize dependencies — upstream packages must not depend on downstream ones**: Keep the dependency graph acyclic with all edges pointing downstream (from foundational to application-level). An upstream package (e.g. `ExchangeTypes`, `Misc`) must never import a downstream package (e.g. `Exchanges`, `Instances`, `Fetch`). A downstream package's `test/Project.toml` must not add extra packages that would create reverse edges — if test-only fixtures or helpers are needed, define them locally in the test file rather than pulling in a downstream package as a test dependency. This prevents circular resolution issues, precompilation failures, and manifests that silently mask import bugs.

20. **Use relative paths for local package dependencies in test Manifests**: When running `Pkg.develop(PackageSpec(path=...))` for a local package in a test environment, pass a relative path (e.g. `"../Foo"` from `Pkg/test/`) rather than an absolute one like `"/project/Foo"`. Absolute paths hardcode the container layout and break when the repository is relocated. Relative paths are resolved from the `test/` directory automatically.

21. **Minimize test deps with `const` aliases or qualified `using`**: When reducing a test package's direct dependencies, use `const Foo = Instances.ParentModule.Bar` aliases or `using Instances.ParentModule.Bar: symbol` instead of `using Bar` to access packages that exist only as transitive deps. Direct `using Bar` in a Pkg.test() environment may fail with "Package not found in current path" because the test environment only guarantees direct deps on LOAD_PATH. Prefer reaching through already-loaded parent modules (e.g. `const HTTP = Instances.Exchanges.ExchangeTypes.CcxtGateway.HTTP`, `using Data.Zarr: ZArray`, `using Data.DataFrames`).

22. **Search for orphan files across ALL included `.jl` files, not just `module.jl`**: When checking if a source file is orphaned, grep for `include("filename")` across every `.jl` file in `src/`, not only `module.jl`. Files can be included from non-root files (e.g. `impl.jl` includes `dispatch.jl`, `load.jl` includes `candles.jl`). A file missing from `module.jl` is not necessarily orphaned if it's included transitively.

23. **Test precompile workloads, not just module loading**: `CCXT_GATEWAY_DISABLE=true` suppresses `precompile.jl` entirely — running `using Foo` with it set only verifies module loading, not the precompile workload paths. Real failures (type mismatches, missing method dispatch, gateway errors) only surface when precompile workloads execute. Always test **without** `CCXT_GATEWAY_DISABLE` (and without `--compiled-modules=no`) before declaring a package "precompiles successfully". If the gateway is unavailable in your environment, acknowledge that precompile workloads were skipped rather than claiming success.

24. **Fix the root cause of precompile failures, not just silence errors**: Wrapping a precompile workload in try/catch and logging with `@debug` changes nothing about the underlying problem — the API call still failed, the connection was still refused, the token was still invalid. Silencing prevents noise but does not fix the package. The proper fix is either (a) rewrite the precompile workload to avoid the failing operation entirely (e.g., don't make live HTTP calls during precompilation), or (b) supply mock endpoints so the workload exercises the real code path without depending on external services. Use try/catch only as a last resort when the failure is in an external dependency you cannot control (e.g., an upstream package's type instability).

25. **Use `dt()` from TimeTicks, not `DateTime(Int64)`, to convert timestamp integers to DateTime**: `DateTime(2024)` interprets the integer as a year number (returns `2024-01-01`), not as milliseconds since epoch. Always use `dt(ts)` (which calls `unix2datetime(ts / 1000)`) to convert production Unix-ms timestamps to DateTime.

26. **Coverage measurement for packages with local deps**: When `Pkg.test()` sandbox prevents local package resolution, measure coverage via `julia --project=test --code-coverage=user` with explicit `Pkg.develop` for local deps and `include("test/runtests.jl")`. CoverageTools' `FileCoverage.coverage` vector may contain `nothing` values — use `x !== nothing` guards when counting covered/executable lines.

27. **Verify watcher fixes end-to-end with `start!(w)`, not just unit tests**: Unit tests with a custom `Val{:test_ticker}` watcher can pass 23/23 even when the production watcher has a `iswatch` logic bug, because the custom Val type doesn't exercise the gateway `has` endpoint. Always run a real `start!(w)` on the actual production watcher type to catch runtime behavioral bugs (buffer stuck at 1, view empty, stale data) that unit tests cannot simulate.

28. **After a Rocket.jl version upgrade, audit ALL `Rocket.map`, `Rocket.subscribe!`, and `|>` piping callsites across the entire codebase**: Rocket v1.9 broke three API signatures: `Rocket.map(f)` → `Rocket.map(Nothing, f)`, `Rocket.subscribe!(pipeline)` → `Rocket.subscribe!(pipeline, Rocket.lambda(...))`, and `pipeline |> map(f)` → requires type param. Grep for ALL occurrences across every package — 5 production files were affected (Watchers/utils.jl, Watchers/module.jl, LiveMode/ohlcv.jl, LiveMode/balance.jl, LiveMode/positions.jl). The breakages surface at runtime, not at load time, making them easy to miss without end-to-end testing.

29. **Before calling `choosefunc` in any watcher, start the gateway exchange subprocess first**: `getexchange!` loads markets into the Julia `Exchange` object but does **not** populate the gateway subprocess's `has` dict — the dict only fills after an explicit `start_exchange` call. Calling `choosefunc` before that causes `issupported` to return false for all methods, producing `"Exchange X does not support any Y methods"`. Add a `_start_gateway_exchange(eid)` call before every `choosefunc` invocation and wait for the exchange to be ready via `exchange_ready` with retries.

30. **When debugging watcher fetch-to bugs, capture guard-state values before any fix**: The `_fetchto!` guard at line 448 (`if diff > prd || ...`) must be logged at the exact decision point (inside the `if`, before `_fetch_candles`) to confirm whether `diff` truly exceeds `prd`. Adding debug `@warn` only after observing the bug, inside the protected block, leaves ambiguity about whether the guard actually passed or a separate code path reached `_fetch_candles`.

31. **Always verify `rangebetween` bounds semantics when slicing fetched timestamped data**: `rangebetween(v, left, right; strict=true)` uses exclusive bounds on both sides (`left < val < right`), so when `_lastdate(candles) == from`, the left-bound exclusion drops every row and produces an empty result — the root cause of `_sticky_fetchto!` exhaustion.
32. **For REST-only watchers, bypass `choosefunc` with a direct `call_exchange` to the known REST method**: `_multifunc` may select a WebSocket method that blocks (Gotcha #36), and `choosefunc` makes a gateway HTTP call on every invocation. For watchers needing deterministic REST polling (iswatch=false), call `call_exchange(client, id, "fetchTrades"; body=Dict("symbol" => sym))` directly instead of going through `choosefunc(exc_id, "Trade", sym)`.

33. **Always prefer websockets when available — never swap method ordering to REST-first to work around WebSocket timeout issues**: If a WebSocket method (suffix `Ws` or `watch*` prefix) times out, fix the timeout by extending it for WS methods via `call_exchange(...; timeout=300.0)` in `_first` rather than demoting WS methods to fallback position. The WS-first ordering in `ohlcv_func_bykind` (and similar `choosefunc`/`_multifunc` selectors) is intentional design — WebSocket subscriptions are long-lived and should not be constrained by the default 30s REST timeout.

34. **The gateway must serve HTTPS to match the client's `use_ssl=true` default**: On startup, `daemon_gateway.py` generates a self-signed SSL cert via `openssl req -x509` and sets `CCXT_GATEWAY_SERVER_USE_SSL=true` (plus CERT/KEY env vars) before importing the main module. This ensures the Pydantic `ServerConfig` picks them up at import time. The Julia client already sets `require_ssl_verification=false` for self-signed certs.

35. **Test each layer independently when debugging multi-layer WS dispatch**: When a WS method returns "missing positional argument", the chain (Julia `getproperty` closure → `call_exchange` HTTP → Python subprocess `_call_method`) may drop positional args at any layer. Call a concrete method and check the subprocess/gateway log to pinpoint which layer loses them, then verify each layer's arg forwarding separately before assuming the chain works.

36. **After fixing shared utility code (macros, helper functions), run ALL downstream tests, not just the specific example that triggered the fix**: The `@py` macro regression (`esc()` missing) affected the OHLCV candles watcher, which wasn't in the original debug target set. A fix that looks correct for one caller may silently break others — run the full downstream test suite.

37. **Use `state.ticks` not `open==high==low==close` to detect stale candles in ticker-derived OHLCV**: A `open==high==low==close` filter is too aggressive — it skips legitimate one-ticker minutes where the market didn't move, creating unfillable gaps. Use `state.ticks == 0` instead: a candle with `state.ticks > 0` had at least one real ticker contribute to it and must be pushed even if flat. The `state.ticks` counter is reset to 0 at each new minute boundary and incremented by `_update_sym_ohlcv` for every real ticker. When `ticker=nothing` (stale-check path), `state.ticks` stays 0 and the candle is correctly skipped.

39. **Parameterize hardcoded defaults via env vars, following the `PLANAR_FLOAT_TYPE` → `DFT` pattern**: When a hardcoded default (quote currency, asset pair, etc.) appears in multiple packages or precompile scripts, define it as a `const` in `PlanarCore/src/Misc/types.jl` alongside `DFT`/`DEFAULT_FLOAT_TYPE`, export it, and reference it everywhere the hardcoded value was used. Add the env var to `.envrc` as a commented example. This allows users to change defaults for tests, compilation, and strategy runs without editing source code.

   Example pattern:
   ```julia
   # In PlanarCore/src/Misc/types.jl
   const QUOTE_CURRENCY = DEFAULT_QUOTE_CURRENCY = Symbol(get(ENV, "PLANAR_QUOTE_CURRENCY", "USDT"))
   const DEFAULT_ASSETS = DEFAULT_PAIRS = split(get(ENV, "PLANAR_DEFAULT_ASSETS", "BTC/USDT"), ",")
   ```

   Then update all downstream references: `Config.qc` defaults, `filter_markets` defaults, precompile/compile scripts, and `.envrc` documentation.

### Gotchas

1. **Always wrap CcxtGateway calls in try/catch**: The gateway may not be running or may return errors. Always provide Python fallbacks with `_python` suffix.

2. **Type mismatches**: Python returns `Py` objects, CcxtGateway returns JSON. Use `obj["key"]` instead of `obj.key`, and standard Julia types instead of Python types.

3. **Blocking vs async**: Python ccxt has both sync and async versions. HTTP calls to gateway are blocking by default - consider this when migrating code that expects async behavior.

4. **Connection management**: Python ccxt manages exchange connections internally. CcxtGateway requires explicit `start_exchange`/`stop_exchange` calls.

5. **Method availability**: Python's `exchange.has` dictionary tells what methods an exchange supports. CcxtGateway's `exchange_has()` does the same (with TTL caching) - call it before attempting methods.

6. **Null handling**: Python uses `pynull`, `pyNone`, `pynothing`. JSON uses `nothing`, `missing`, or absent keys. Handle both.

7. **Julia function definitions**: Functions in Julia can be defined without the `function` keyword (e.g., `foo(x) = x + 1` or via assignment like `foo = x -> x + 1`). Search for all forms using patterns like `^\s*\w+\s*\(`, `^\s*\w+\s*=`, and `^\s*\w+\s*->`.

8. **JSON3.Object is not Dict**: `JSON3.parse` returns `JSON3.Object`, not `Dict`. Use `Union{Dict, JSON3.Object}` for type assertions, or convert with `Dict{String, Any}(string(k) => v for (k, v) in pairs(obj))`. **Critical:** `pairs()` on `JSON3.Object` yields `Symbol` keys, not `String` keys — accessing with `haskey(dict, "string_key")` will fail. Always force `string(k)` when creating a lookup dict from JSON3 data.

9. **Gateway must be restarted for Python code changes**: The FastAPI layer may reload with `--reload`, but exchange subprocesses are independent. Restart the full gateway or stop/start the exchange to pick up subprocess changes.

10. **Pidfile for gateway detection**: `/tmp/ccxt_gateway.pid` is written by the gateway on startup and removed on idle-shutdown. This file is used by `using Ccxt` to detect an already-running gateway.

11. **`JSON.jl` does NOT export `json`**: Only `JSON.json` is available; `using JSON` makes `JSON.parse` available but NOT the bare `json` function. Always use `JSON.json(...)` to serialize.

12. **`nothing` from JSON `null` in boolean context**: `get(dict, key, false)` returns `nothing` when the dict contains a JSON `null` value, not `false`. Any `get` on a JSON-populated dict whose result is used as a `Bool` must be wrapped: `something(get(dict, key, false), false)`. The same applies to `any(pred, ...)` — the predicate must return `Bool`, not `nothing`.

13. **`function name(args)` shadows existing variable `name`**: `function f(...)` always introduces a fresh local binding, even if `f` already names a variable in scope. After `f = some_callable()`, writing `function f(...) ... f(...) end` calls the new function recursively, not the original callable. Use `f = function (...) ... end` (assignment form) or rename one of them to avoid confusion.

14. **`using M: Sub` imports only the module binding, not its exports**: After `using Instances.TimeTicks: Dates`, `Dates` is a module binding in scope but `now()`, `DateTime(...)`, etc. are NOT directly available — use `Dates.now()`, `Dates.DateTime(...)`. Only `using Dates` (without qualification) brings Dates' exports into scope.

15. **Importing macro-generated bindings triggers undeclared warnings**: A bare function like `tf` that is only defined as a side effect of a macro (`@tf_str`) may cause `WARNING: Imported binding TimeTicks.tf was undeclared at import time` when imported via `using M: tf`. Only import the macro itself (`@tf_str`) and omit the macro-generated binding. The `@tf_str` macro call syntax (`tf"..."`) does not require the bare `tf` name to be in scope.

16. **`const Dates = Parent.Dates` does not bring Dates' exports into scope**: A `const` alias provides only the module binding. `now()`, `DateTime(...)`, `Second(1)`, `Day(10)` remain undefined — use `Dates.now()`, `Dates.DateTime(...)`, `Dates.Second(1)`, `Dates.Day(10)`. Only `using Dates` (without qualification) or explicit import (`using Dates: now, DateTime`) brings them into scope.

17. **`searchsortedlast` uses `<=` semantics, not `<`**: When computing the exclusive upper bound for a date-range delete on a sorted ZArray, `searchsortedlast` finds the last element `<=` target, but you need the last element `<` target. Use `searchsortedfirst(view, val, ...) - 1` to get the correct view index, then convert to global index with `view_idx + from_idx - 2`.

18. **`Metadata` is immutable**: `Zarr.Metadata{T,N,C,F}` is an immutable struct — `za.metadata.fill_value = newval` throws `setfield!: immutable struct`. To test metadata-recovery paths without live data, corrupt the stored JSON in the underlying store (e.g., `store["path/.zarray"] = codeunits(corrupted)`) and reopen.

19. **`DictStore` needs its own `delete!` with `recursive`**: The generic `delete!(store::AbstractStore, ...; recursive=true)` has no specific method for `DictStore`, causing infinite recursion. Provide a method that iterates `_pkeys(store, path)` and deletes each matching key.

20. **`save_data` / `load_data` in Data/series.jl are dead code**: Despite being exported, `save_data` and `load_data` are never called anywhere in the codebase. Their internal `@to_mat` macro (`Matrix{Float64}(data)`) is incompatible with their own `assert first(data)[data_col] isa DateTime` assertion — Matrix{Float64} can't hold DateTimes. Skip testing them during refactoring; focus on the live code paths.

21. **Vendored vs upstream Zarr API diff**: When switching from vendored `Zarr` to upstream, check every function signature. Upstream `is_zarray`/`is_zgroup` require a `ZarrFormat(2)` first argument, while the vendored version accepted just `(store, path)`. Other functions (`zcreate`, `zopen`, `BloscCompressor`, `fill_value_decoding`, `zgroup`, `isemptysub`) share the same API. Verify with `methods(f)` on both versions.

22. **Upstream Zarr v0.10.0 does NOT export `BloscCompressor` or `DictStore`**: Use explicit `using Zarr: BloscCompressor, DictStore` rather than relying on re-export. Non-exported names are still importable via qualified import.

23. **Float64-wrap `something` chains in limits/amounts to satisfy parametric type constraints**: A `NamedTuple{(:min,:max)}` where `min` is `Int64` (from raw JSON market data via `to_float(v::Number)`) and `max` is `Float64` (from a default) creates a mixed-type NamedTuple. This fails dispatch against a `Limits{T<:Real}` signature requiring all fields to share the same concrete type. Always wrap the result of `something(...)` with `Float64(...)` in functions that build limits NamedTuples, or ensure every fallback/default arm produces the same type.

24. **`TimeFrame("m")` suffix means month, not minute**: `TimeFrame("1m")` creates a Period of `Month(1)`, not `Minute(1)`. Use `TimeFrame("1min")` for minute intervals. Always verify by checking `tf.period` in a REPL before relying on it.

25. **`dt()` from TimeTicks expects Unix ms, not Julia internal `Dates.value()` format**: `dt(ts)` calls `unix2datetime(ts / 1000)`. Mock data helpers (like `_make_ohlcv`) that use `Dates.value(DateTime(...))` produce Julian-internal ms (~6.38e13 for 2024), NOT Unix ms (~1.70e12 for 2024). Create test data with Unix-ms timestamps to match production format and work correctly with `dt()`.

26. **`default_value(f::Function)` calls `Base.return_types(f)` (zero-arg)**: This fails for functions like `Statistics.mean` that have no zero-arg method (returns `Union{}`, then errors). When testing code paths that call `default_value(f)` on empty collections, use `f=sum` (which has `sum()` → `0`) instead of `f=mean` to avoid `ArgumentError: cannot construct a value of type Union{}`.

27. **`--code-coverage` may not generate `.cov` files with cached precompilation**: In Julia 1.12, `--code-coverage=user` only writes `.cov` files for code that is newly compiled. If packages are loaded from cached `.ji` files, no `.cov` files are generated. Use `--compiled-modules=no` to force coverage file generation (at the cost of much longer startup). Alternatively, run `julia --project=test --code-coverage=user` even without `--compiled-modules=no` and the `.cov` files from the precompilation *of the test environment itself* may still appear in the source directories.

28. **`using CodecZlib: Zlib` fails in recent CodecZlib v0.7.x**: `Zlib` is no longer a submodule or exported name. Use `ZlibCompressor`/`ZlibDecompressor` directly instead, e.g., `transcode(ZlibCompressor, data)` not `transcode(Zlib.Compress, data)`.

29. **Precompile `@eval` into closed module `Main` breaks incremental compilation**: During package precompilation, any code that does `@eval Main begin ... using Pkg: Pkg ... end` will fail with `Creating a new global in closed module 'Main' breaks incremental compilation`. To fix, use `$Pkg` interpolation to refer to already-imported packages from the macro's calling module, instead of `using Pkg: Pkg` inside the eval block. More generally, strategy loading (`st.strategy(:BareStrat)`) evals into `Main`, which is incompatible with precompilation — wrap such calls in `try/catch` in precompile workloads, or skip them during `Base.generating_output()`.

30. **`__revise_mode__ = :eval` in production code breaks precompilation**: The `__revise_mode__ = :eval` variable (used by Revise.jl to enable hot-reloading) causes `Evaluation into the closed module 'Metrics' breaks incremental compilation` when the module is loaded during precompilation. Remove this line from production source files — it belongs in development-only user settings.

31. **Docs and config may still reference old env vars**: After removing `JULIA_NOPRECOMP` from source files, check `docs/`, `.envrc`, `.github/workflows/`, and `Dockerfile` for stale references. The env var remains defined but is no longer read by any package code.

32. **All package entry files share the same structure**: Every package's `src/<Package>.jl` should follow: unconditional `include("module.jl")`, optional `__init__() = _doinit()`, and optionally `include("precompile.jl")` guarded by `JULIA_PRECOMP`. The old `JULIA_NOPRECOMP` if/else pattern has been removed from all 33 packages. Verify new packages match this pattern.

33. **`default_process` needs `:last_processed` in attrs**: `default_process` calls `attr(w, :last_processed)` which throws `KeyError(:last_processed)` if the attrs dict doesn't have that key. When manually constructing watchers for testing, always include `:last_processed => nothing` in the attrs dict.

34. **Testing watcher `_process!` requires the Val type argument**: Call `_process!(w, val)` with the Val type (e.g., `_process!(w, Val{:ccxt_ticker}())`), not just `_process!(w)`. The `Watchers.process!` public API dispatches via `_process!(w, _val(w))`.

35. **`@collect_buffer_data` discards buffer entry timestamps**: The macro iterates buffer entries via `docollect((_, value))`, discarding the entry's `.time` field. When ticker data has `null` timestamps (common with exchange `fetchTickers`), all DataFrame rows end up with `nothing` as timestamp. Fix: write a manual collection loop that reads `entry.time` and always uses it as the row timestamp via `merge(ticker, (timestamp=entry_time,))` — not just for null timestamps, because exchanges often return the same real timestamp across consecutive polls, producing duplicate rows.

36. **`first(exc, :watchTickersForSymbols, :watchTickers)` always returns non-nothing from the stub exchange**: The *stub exchange* (`stub_exchanges/`) sets all `has` entries to `True` as a testing convenience, so using `!isnothing(first(exc, :watchTickers))` as a websocket-detection heuristic always evaluates to `true`, forcing the watcher into the websocket path which sets `_tfunc = () -> check_task!(w)` (a no-op). This is NOT a gateway issue — a real CcxtGateway with a live exchange returns accurate ccxt-pro `has` values. For production, auto-detect from the `has` dict via `get(attrs, :iswatch) do has(exc, :watchOHLCVForSymbols) || has(exc, :watchOHLCV) end` (Gotcha #50).

37. **Closures that call `choosefunc` capture its result by value, not re-evaluating each invocation**: In `_reset_tickers_func!`, the closure `tickers_func` captured `choosefunc(exc_id, "Ticker", fetch_symbols)` at creation time. Subsequent invocations repeated the same stale snapshot. Fix: move the `choosefunc` call inside the closure body so method selection is re-evaluated on every tick.

38. **Rocket v1.9 requires a type parameter on `Rocket.map` and an actor on `Rocket.subscribe!`**: `Rocket.map(v -> ...)` → `Rocket.map(Nothing, v -> ...)`. `Rocket.subscribe!(pipeline)` → `Rocket.subscribe!(pipeline, Rocket.lambda(...))`. Missing these produces `MethodError` at runtime, not at load time — easy to miss without end-to-end testing.

39. **`Ccxt._suffix_to_methods` doesn't handle `"L1OrderBook"` or `"L2OrderBook"` suffixes**: The orderbook watcher calls `_multifunc(exc_id, "L1OrderBook", true)` which dispatches to `_suffix_to_methods`, but that function only maps `"OrderBook"`, `"Ticker"`, `"Trade"`, `"OHLCV"`, `"Order"`, `"Balance"`. The `"L1"`/`"L2"` prefix is stripped by the Python ccxt path, but CcxtGateway passes the raw suffix string. Fix: add explicit `"L1OrderBook"` and `"L2OrderBook"` entries, or normalize the suffix before lookup.

40. **`_ensure_ohlcv!` may create a `CcxtOHLCVTickerVal` watcher whose view stays empty even after the buffer populates**: The `_process!` for `CcxtOHLCVTickerVal` has warmup/pending logic that delays processing until conditions are met. If the source buffer never triggers the right pending check, the view remains `DataFrame()` forever while the buffer grows. Debugging tip: inspect `w.state.view_keys` — if `String[]`, no view entry was ever created.


42. **Same-signature function duplicates in the same module produce no warnings**: When moving a function to a shared file (e.g., `_start_gateway_exchange` into `utils.jl`), stale copies remaining in other files compile silently — Julia only warns about method overwriting across different modules. Grep for the function name across all `.jl` files in the package after moving it and remove every duplicate.

43. **`rangebetween` with `strict=true` uses exclusive bounds on both sides**: `rangeafter(v, left; strict=true)` returns indices where `val > left` (strictly after) and `rangebefore(v, right; strict=true)` returns indices where `val < right` (strictly before). When the last candle timestamp equals the `from` boundary used for fetching, `rangebetween(candles.timestamp, from, to)` returns empty because no element is strictly greater than `left`. Fix: subtract `Millisecond(1)` from the left bound, or pass `strict=false` for inclusive behavior.
44. **A closure referencing a variable from its calling function's scope silently resolves to a global (often undefined)**: Julia closures capture variables lexically — they do NOT see variables from the function that *calls* them, only from their own definition site. E.g., if `_start!` defines a local `fetch_func` and `_make_trades_func` returns a closure that calls `fetch_func()`, that name resolves to a global (likely undefined). The `UndefVarError` is caught by a bare `catch` block, making the bug invisible — the fallback (e.g., `choosefunc`) runs on every invocation, compounding timeouts. Always pass such dependencies as explicit parameters to the helper function.

45. **`fetchXxxWs` methods are one-shot request-response calls via ccxt.pro's internal WS, NOT long-lived subscriptions**: ccxt.pro's `fetchOHLCVWs`, `fetchTickerWs`, etc. open a temporary WS connection, get one result, close the WS, and return. They are appropriate for request-response fetches and preferred over REST for lower latency. Do NOT reorder `ohlcv_func_bykind`/`choosefunc` to REST-first — instead, fix the gateway support: (a) add `_start_gateway_exchange` call before any `first(exc, ...)` that may select a WS method, (b) match the ZMQ broker timeout to the method type (300s for `*Ws`/`watch*`, 30s for REST), and (c) fix `_wait_for_ready` to wait for the actual `subprocess_ready` ZMQ message rather than a hardcoded sleep. The `*Ws` suffix in Julia's `_first` side detects these via `endswith(m, "Ws")` and sets `timeout=300.0`, which must be propagated through to the ZMQ broker's `asyncio.wait_for`.

46. **Environment variables for gateway config (`CCXT_GATEWAY_SERVER_*`) must be set BEFORE importing `ccxt_gateway.main`**: `Settings()` is instantiated at module level in `main.py:119`, and Pydantic reads env vars at `ServerConfig()` construction time. Setting env vars after import has no effect — the config values are already baked.

47. **If the gateway crashes during startup (e.g. missing Python dep), the pidfile is written before the crash**: `_gateway_pid` gets assigned from the pidfile read in `spawn_gateway`, but the gateway process is already dead. `_check_gateway_up`'s ping fallback correctly returns false and `spawn_gateway` will retry. Always check `/tmp/gateway.log` for import errors when `_check_gateway_up` returns false despite a pidfile existing.

48. **`isrightadj`/`isleftadj`/`isrecent` closures in `_fetchto!` crash on empty DataFrame**: These closures at `Watchers/src/impls/utils.jl:511-513` unconditionally call `lastdate(df)`/`firstdate(df)`, which throws `BoundsError` on a 0-row DataFrame via `df[end, :timestamp]`. The `@debug` at `utils.jl:518` triggers the crash by eagerly evaluating `isapp()` → `isrightadj()` → `lastdate(df)` before the `isempty(df)` guard at line 519 can short-circuit. Always guard adjacency helpers with `isempty(df) ? false : ...` when they access `lastdate`/`firstdate`.

49. **`_fetchto!` contiguity error at line 508 throws before `isapp()` can handle gaps, causing infinite retry loop**: When the exchange returns data with a timestamp gap (missing candle), line 508's `!=` check fires `_fetch_error` (throws), aborting before line 519's `isapp()` → `isrecent()` → `_empty!!(df)` can recover by discarding stale `df` and appending the fresh gap data. The error propagates to `_tryfetch`'s catch block, df is never updated, and every subsequent tick retries the same `from` → same gap → same throw, creating an infinite loop (174+ attempts observed). Fix: change the condition from `!=` to `<` — only throw when cleaned starts *before* df's last row (overlap/corruption that `isapp()` cannot handle), not when it starts after (gap that `isapp()` can recover).

50. **`iswatch = get(attrs, :iswatch, false)` forces REST-only even when the exchange supports websocket methods**: The hardcoded `false` default suppresses auto-detection from `has(:watchOHLCVForSymbols)` — the exchange's real ccxt metadata is the authoritative source for WS support. Fix: use `get(attrs, :iswatch) do has(exc, :watchOHLCVForSymbols) || has(exc, :watchOHLCV) end` so the `false` fallback comes from the exchange's capabilities, not a constant. Override only when the user explicitly sets `iswatch=true/false` in attrs.

51. **`Base.getproperty` closures on `CcxtExchange` silently drop positional args**: The closure at `ExchangeTypes/src/exchange.jl:228` captures `args...` and `kwargs...` but only passes `kwargs` to `call_exchange` — `args...` is never used. Forward positional args via `body[:_args] = [a for a in args]` and pop `_args` in the subprocess's `_call_method`.

52. **`_args` must be at the top level of the body dict, not nested inside `"params"`**: For fetch methods with kwargs, wrapping the entire body inside `Dict("params" => body)` buries `_args` where the subprocess's `params.pop("_args", [])` cannot find it. Always append `_args` to the outer body dict, not the inner `params` dict.

53. **Python `startswith("watch_")` misses camelCase WS methods**: The subprocess at `subprocess.py:302` used `startswith("watch_")` to detect WebSocket methods, but `watchOHLCVForSymbols` (camelCase) produces `method = "watchOHLCVForSymbols"` which doesn't start with `watch_`. Fix: add `method[5].isupper()` as an alternative detection branch for camelCase watch methods.

54. **Python venv `pyvenv.cfg` version mismatch silently breaks site-packages loading**: If `.venv/pyvenv.cfg` has `version_info = 3.14` but the host Python is 3.11, the interpreter ignores the venv config entirely and never reads `.pth` files — `uv pip install -e .` succeeds but `python3 -m ccxt_gateway.daemon_gateway` fails with "No module found". Fix: recreate the venv matching the exact host version with `rm -rf .venv && uv venv --python $(python3 --version | cut -d' ' -f2)`.

55. **State struct fields storing deserialized external data must not have narrow type constraints**: `CandleWatcherSymbolState4.nextcandle` was typed `Union{Nothing, Tuple}`, but WS data arrives as JSON3.Object (or Dict{Symbol} after JSON3 parse). The narrow annotation causes `TypeError` on assignment. Use untyped fields (`= nothing` without type annotation) or widen the Union to include `Dict` and `JSON3.Object` for fields that hold deserialized API/WS responses.

56. **`choosefunc` calls `call_exchange` without a timeout, relying on the 30s GatewayClient default**: Exchange API calls like `fetchTickers` with many symbols can take longer than 30s, causing `TimeoutError: Connection closed after 30 seconds`. Always pass a `timeout` parameter (e.g. `timeout=120.0`) to `call_exchange` from `choosefunc`, matching the pattern used by `_first` in `ExchangeTypes/src/exchange.jl` which already sets timeouts per-method.

57. **The gateway has THREE independent timeout layers — all must be increased for slow exchange API calls**: (1) Julia HTTP timeout (`GatewayClient` default 30s, increased via `call_exchange(; timeout=...)`), (2) ZMQ broker timeout in gateway `rest.py` (hardcoded 30s for REST methods), and (3) ccxt exchange timeout in the subprocess (30000ms). Fixing only one layer still fails. The Julia `call_exchange` now injects `_timeout` into the POST body, which the gateway extracts for its broker timeout and forwards to the subprocess's `_call_method` which sets `self.exchange.timeout` dynamically for the call, then restores it.

58. **When injecting a key into a `Dict` whose key type you don't control, use `keytype(body)` to convert the key**: Writing `body["_timeout"]` assumes String keys, but a caller may pass `Dict{Symbol,Any}()` (TypeError: Symbol key expected). Writing `body[:_timeout]` assumes Symbol keys, but a caller may pass `Dict{String,Any}()` (MethodError: String key expected). Always use `K = keytype(body); body[K(:_timeout)] = val` — this works for both `Dict{Symbol,Any}` and `Dict{String,Any}`, and any other `Dict{K}` where `K` can be constructed from a Symbol.

59. **`@py` stub macro without `esc()` causes `UndefVarError` at the call site**: `macro py(expr); expr; end` resolves symbols in the macro's defining module scope, not the caller's. Callers like `@py([sym, tf_str])` fail with `UndefVarError: sym not defined`. Always use `esc(expr)` in stub macros so symbols resolve in the caller's scope.

60. **`CircularBuffer` silently accepts `capacity=0` but throws on first `push!`**: `CircularBuffer{Any}(0)` appears to construct successfully but `push!` fails with `ArgumentError: capacity must be ≥ 1`. Always use `capacity >= 1`.

61. **`fromdict` with `Union{Nothing, T}` fields fails when JSON value is `null`**: The generated `fromdict` calls `convert(T, nothing)` which throws `MethodError` for numeric `T`. Fix: when the parsed value is `nothing` for an `Option{T}` field, skip the convert call.

62. **CoinPaprika and similar Symbol-keyed API responses break `fromdict`'s String-key lookup**: The API returns dicts with `Symbol` keys via JSON3, but `fromdict` uses `haskey(di, "key")` which fails. Always stringify dict keys via `Dict{String,Any}(string(k) => v for (k, v) in pairs(d))` before passing to `fromdict`.

63. **WS watcher `_tfunc` closures must read `ws_client` from `attrs` each cycle, not capture a stale reference**: When the WS drops and `_connect_ws_*!` reconnects, it stores the new client in `attrs[:ws_client]`. A captured `_ws_client` still holds the dead connection. Always read `ws_client = get(attrs, :ws_client, nothing)` inside the closure body so reconnections are picked up automatically.

64. **`_run_read_loop` must treat `HTTP.WebSockets.WebSocketError` as a clean close, not an error**: When a WebSocket drops with close code 1006 (abnormal closure), `receive` throws `WebSocketError` but the connection is still done — the read loop should `break` silently, just like `EOFError`. Otherwise every exchange-initiated WS disconnect logs a noisy `@error` that looks like a bug but is normal.

65. **WS watcher subscription setup is duplicated identically across 4 watchers — factor into `_connect_ws_subscribe!` + `_setup_ws_watcher!`**: Every `_connect_ws_*!` function in `ccxt_ohlcv_trades.jl`, `ccxt_orderbook.jl`, `ccxt_tickers.jl`, and `ccxt_ohlcv_candles.jl` shares the same structure: get handler → `default_ws_client()` → `connect!` → `send_subscribe` with `subject.next!` callback → store in attrs. Every `_tfunc!` reconnect closure is identical: `ws_client from attrs → is_connected? check_task! : reconnect → fallback`. Put the shared logic in `Watchers/src/impls/utils.jl` as `_connect_ws_subscribe!(w, eid, method, params)` and `_setup_ws_watcher!(w, eid, method, params, rest_fallback)`. The latter sets up the reconnect-aware `_tfunc` automatically. Each watcher call site becomes 3 lines: `if _setup_ws_watcher!(w, eid, method, params, rest_fallback) else _tfunc!(attrs, rest_fallback) end`. Don't forget to add `_stop!` WS cleanup (`send_unsubscribe` + `ws_sub_id` delete) to any watcher that's missing it.

66. **Every WS reconnect must clean up the OLD subscription callback from `client.subscriptions` to prevent unbounded dict growth**: `default_ws_client()` is a singleton whose `client.subscriptions` dict stores callback closures keyed by subscription UUID. Each reconnect calls `send_subscribe` which adds a new entry, but the old one is never removed. Over many reconnections (e.g. flaky WS), stale callbacks accumulate in the dict — each one is a closure capturing the handler's Rocket `subject`. Fix: call `send_unsubscribe(old_sub_id)` in `_connect_ws_subscribe!` before creating a new subscription — `send_unsubscribe` deletes from `client.subscriptions` as its first action, before even trying to send over the wire, so it works even when the old connection is dead. Also wrap `send_subscribe` in try/catch — if `connect!` did not actually establish a connection (e.g. due to a race in the old task's cleanup), `send_message` throws `error("WebSocket not connected")` which must be caught to return `false` cleanly.

67. **`connect!` has a stale-task race that silently returns true without connecting**: `connect!` checks `is_connected(client)` first; if false, it then checks `client.task !== nothing && istaskstarted(client.task) && !istaskdone(client.task)` and returns `true` immediately if the old task is still alive (e.g. still executing its `finally` block after a WS disconnect). This bypasses reconnection entirely, and the subsequent `send_subscribe` → `send_message` call fails with `error("WebSocket not connected")`. Fix: `wait(client.task)` instead of `return true` — the old task's `finally` block will soon set `client.task = nothing` and complete, allowing the reconnect to proceed. The `finally` block is cheap (two dict operations and an assignment), so the wait is near-instantaneous.
68. **Never `append!`/`push!` the result of a cache/load reader without an `isnothing` guard**: `Data.load` (and `load_data`) return `nothing` when the cached entry is missing or corrupt (e.g. `Data/src/series.jl` `_wrap_load_data` catch path, or a freshly purged cache). Appending `nothing` to a `DataFrame` throws `MethodError` and aborts the caller — and these callers (`Instances.load!`, `Engine` datahandler resampling) sit on the strategy startup/running loop. Always guard: `loaded = load(...); isnothing(loaded) && continue` (or `isnothing(loaded) || append!(df, loaded)`). The same applies to any `load_cache`/`load_*` that documents a `nothing` return for absent keys.
69. **Precompile workloads that call another package's precomp-only symbols must guard on `isdefined`**: A package's `precompile.jl` is typically included only when `occursin("PkgName", JULIA_PRECOMP)` is true. An extension or downstream package that calls a symbol defined *only* in that package's `precompile.jl` (e.g. `Opt._precomp_strat`) will hit `UndefVarError` when precompiling under a different `JULIA_PRECOMP` value (e.g. `Plotting`). Gate the workload with `if isdefined(OtherPkg, :_precomp_strat) ... end` so it is skipped when those symbols are absent. The inner `isnothing(...)` guard is insufficient — the undefined access fires *before* it. (See Gotcha #10 for the `isdefined(ParentModule, :TheModule) || return` strategy-loading pattern.)

70. **Mock HTTP `get_handler` MUST serve `GET /ping` → `200` (with a `pong` body)**: The `Exchange` constructor (`ExchangeTypes/exchange.jl`) calls `ping(client)` at object-creation time; this is the ONLY gateway-health check during construction, separate from `default_client`'s lazy `_ensure_gateway_running`. If the test's mock `get_handler` (e.g. `setup_mock` in `Ccxt/test_rest_mock.jl` and `PlanarCore/test/Exchanges/runtests.jl`) returns `error("Unexpected GET")` for `/ping`, `ping` fails → the constructor's `!ping(client)` guard falls into `spawn_gateway()` → the spawned daemon cannot bind `tcp://127.0.0.1:5557` (held by a prior orphan → `ZMQError: Address already in use`) → the verify-ping fails → `@error: Gateway failed to start` (`CcxtGateway/rest.jl:708`) and the exchange object is left broken, retrying the spawn on every subsequent construction. Prevention: (1) serve `/ping` in the mock `get_handler` (return `200` with `{"result":"pong"}`), AND (2) set `Rest._gateway_initialized[] = true` in `setup_mock` so `default_client` short-circuits before pinging at all. Always kill orphaned daemons (remove `/tmp/ccxt_gateway.pid`) before a clean `Pkg.test()` run.

71. **Pass function-valued parameters to hot-loop-boundary functions as POSITIONAL args, never kwargs — Julia specializes only on positional arguments**: A kwarg reaches the method body through the `Base.kwcall`/kwarg-sorter layer, so its concrete type (e.g. a capturing closure passed as `step`) is only guaranteed to land in the signature when the call site builds the kwarg `Pairs` with statically-known types; any runtime/`kwargs...` splatting path degrades the parameter to `Any` → dynamic dispatch on every per-item call. Positional args always participate in dispatch, so the closure type is baked into the method signature and `step(item)` compiles to a static call. Example: `_sim_loop!(s, items, step, dateof; show_progress, ...)` — `step`/`dateof` are positional, the config flags stay as kwargs. Verify with `@code_warntype` that the loop variable and the `step`/`dateof` parameters are concrete and the per-item call is `Core.Const`-dispatched.
72. **Do not declare user-space strategy projects (`user/strategies/*`) as `PlanarDev` (or core package) dependencies**: Projects under `user/strategies/` (e.g. `StrategyFramework`) are external user code, not Planar packages. Listing them in `[deps]`/`[sources]` couples the dev environment to a user's local directory and breaks portable checkouts. Such strategies are meant to be loaded only at runtime via a user's own `planar.toml` `[sources]`, never as a hard dependency of the framework.

73. **Trailing stray tokens in `@deassert`/`@assert` conditions silently break precompilation**: A multi-clause `@deassert cond1 || cond2 || cond3` with a stray trailing token (e.g. `o isa IncreaseLimitOrder o`) parses as `cond3 o` — a function-call syntax error that crashes the module at precompilation time with a `SyntaxError` or `MethodError` in the macro expansion, not at runtime. The bug is invisible in a normal `using Pkg` load because precompilation is skipped when cached `.ji` files are present; it only surfaces when the cache is invalidated or `--compiled-modules=no` is used. Always visually scan multi-clause `@deassert`/`@assert`/`||` chains for stray tokens after the last operand. Verify by forcing a fresh precompile (`rm -rf ~/.julia/compiled/*/<Pkg>` then `julia --project=<Pkg> -e 'using <Pkg>'`) — do not rely on cached loads.

74. **Precompile workloads must not spawn processes, do network I/O, or log loudly — guard with `Base.generating_output()`**: A `@precomp` workload that reaches process-spawning or network code runs it on every fresh `Pkg.precompile` (e.g. after a Julia upgrade invalidates the cache), on machines where the service was never installed. Concrete instance: `default_client()` → `_ensure_gateway_running()` → `spawn_gateway()` ran its stale-PID kill and port-ping sweep, then threw `ccxt-gateway is not installed` from `_find_gateway_python(install=false)` — despite the docstring claiming a precompile no-op. The throw propagated through `Exchange()` → `getexchange!` → `stub_strategy`, surfacing as `┌ Error: stubs: strategy construction failed` on a routine `using PlanarCore`. Fix pattern: (a) `_ensure_gateway_running`-style entry points return early under `Base.generating_output()`; (b) `spawn_gateway`-style functions with unavoidable side effects fail fast at the top under `generating_output()`, before kills/pings/truncation; (c) `@error`/`@warn`-then-rethrow sites on *designed* skip paths (workload catches and continues) log at `@debug` under `generating_output()` — runtime keeps the loud level; (d) skip dead-wait `sleep`s when no service can exist. Verify by purging the package cache (`rm -rf ~/.julia/compiled/v1.XX/<Pkg>`) and precompiling with the service absent: exit 0 with zero `┌ Error` lines.

## CCXT Migration Review Checklist

Before committing changes to a migrated function, verify each item below. This checklist catches the most common migration errors found during the Exchanges refactor.

### Parameter Name Audit

The subprocess dispatches HTTP query params as `**kwargs` directly to ccxt methods. **Every keyword name must match the ccxt method's parameter name exactly.**

- [ ] For each `call_exchange(…, method, query=Dict("key" => val))`, verify every `"key"` matches the ccxt method's parameter name
  - Check the ccxt source or error message — Python tells you "Did you mean 'correct_name'?" on mismatch
  - Common ccxt parameter names: `symbol`, `type`, `leverage`, `side`, `marginMode`, `hedged`, `enable`, `enabled`, `reduceOnly`, `newClientOrderId`, etc.
  - **Gotcha:** `set_sandbox_mode()` uses `enabled` not `enable`
- [ ] Verify the ccxt method actually accepts named parameters for the keys you're sending
  - Some ccxt methods take positional args only — use the `params={}` dict pattern if needed
  - The subprocess's `_call_method` expands the dict with `**`, so named params must match the function signature
- [ ] **Expe** `params` in a `Dict("params" => Dict(...))` sub-dict when the ccxt method signature is `method(self, *args, params={})`. This applies to most `fetch*` methods where exchange-specific filtering (e.g. `type="swap"`) goes in the `params` argument — passing it as a top-level keyword will raise `TypeError: got an unexpected keyword argument`.
  - Common examples: `fetchTickers`, `fetchOHLCV`, `fetchOrders`, `fetchMyTrades`
  - The old Python bindings used `pyfetch(f; params=LittleDict(...))` which routed these into `params` automatically

### Type Audit (String Safety)

HTTP query parameters are **always strings**. ccxt methods expecting booleans, integers, or floats may misinterpret them.

- [ ] For each ccxt method parameter in the query dict, check if ccxt handles string coercion
  - Booleans: string `"true"` / `"false"` are both truthy in Python (`bool("false") == True`) — **never pass boolean strings for boolean params**
  - Integers: strings like `"10"` usually work (ccxt calls `int()` internally), but `since` (epoch ms) fails as a string — see fix below
  - **Fix:** `_first` in `ExchangeTypes` now passes `body=kwargs` (POST, preserves JSON types) instead of `query=kwargs` (GET, stringifies everything). Any code that bypasses `_first` and calls `call_exchange` directly must pass `body=` for typed params.
- [ ] For boolean flags: either use POST body (preserves Julia Bool type through JSON) or convert to `"0"`/`"1"` or strip the param

### Method Name Audit

The subprocess dispatches method names via `getattr(self.exchange, method)`. The name must match a ccxt attribute.

- [ ] Verify the method name exists on the ccxt exchange object
  - ccxt uses snake_case internally but provides camelCase aliases via `__getattr__`
  - Test with `hasattr(exchange, "yourMethod")` or check the error response
- [ ] Special subprocess handlers exist for: `set_api_key`, `enableRateLimit`, `timeout`, `rateLimit`, `has`, `metadata`, `urls` — these don't go through generic dispatch
- [ ] All other method names are passed through via `getattr` + `**kwargs`

### Dispatch Path Audit

Know which code path your call takes in the subprocess (`subprocess.py`):

| Dispatch Condition | Behavior | Example Methods |
|---|---|---|
| `method in settable_props` | Sets attribute directly | `timeout`, `enableRateLimit`, `rateLimit` |
| `method == "set_api_key"` | Sets 5 credentials | `set_api_key` |
| `hasattr(exchange, method) && callable(attr)` | Calls with `**params` | `fetchTicker`, `setLeverage`, `setMarginMode` |
| `hasattr(exchange, method) && !callable(attr)` | Lazy-loads attribute via `load_<method>()` | `markets`, `currencies`, `timeframes` |
| No match | Returns error | — |

- [ ] Verify your method name hits the expected dispatch path
- [ ] For custom methods like `setSandboxMode`: verify `hasattr(exchange, "setSandboxMode")` is True before deploying

### Duplicate Definition Audit

- [ ] grep for the new function name across the entire package to ensure no pre-existing definition with the same signature
- [ ] Run the package and check for `WARNING: Method definition … overwritten` which signals duplicates
- [ ] Check both positional **and** keyword signatures — Julia dispatches on positional args only, so different kwargs don't disambiguate

### Import Audit

- [ ] After adding `using .OtherModule: sym1, sym2` to a file, verify every imported symbol actually exists in `OtherModule`
- [ ] Run the calling module and check for `WARNING: Imported binding … was undeclared at import time` and `conflicts with an existing identifier`
- [ ] Convention: `issandbox` lives in `Exchanges` (constructors.jl), **not** in `ExchangeTypes` — verify your import source is correct

## Lessons Learned (2026-05-23 — Fetch migration)

During the Fetch package migration from Python ccxt to CcxtGateway, the following mistakes were made by the AI assistant. Documented to avoid repetition.

### 1. Audit ALL files in the package, not just the "important" ones

The assistant migrated `impl.jl`, `funding.jl`, and `orderbook.jl` but forgot to check `precompile.jl`, which still contained `Python.py_start_loop()` / `Python.py_stop_loop()` calls. Because precompile.jl is only included when `JULIA_PRECOMP` is set, `--compiled-modules=no` testing didn't catch it. **Always grep for Python/ccxt references across every `.jl` file in the package before declaring the migration done.**

### 2. Verify every function body survives edit surgery

When deleting large blocks of Python-specific code, the assistant accidentally removed the `_to_ohlcv_vecs` function body because it was adjacent to the deleted Python functions. **After every large deletion, search for every name referenced in error messages and confirm its definition still exists.** Use `rg "^function name|^name\s*="` to verify.

### 3. Anticipate JSON `null` → Julia `nothing` coercion bugs

The `_has` function used `get(h, s, false)` expecting only `true/false` values, but the gateway's JSON response can contain `null` which parses as `nothing`. **Any `get(dict, key, fallback)` where the dict was populated from JSON must wrap the result with `something(..., fallback)` to guard against `nothing` values.** The same applies to `any(pred, ...)` predicates — they must return a `Bool`, not `nothing`.

### 4. Check file include order before moving includes

When fixing the `consts.jl` unconditional include in `Misc.jl`, the assistant initially placed `include("consts.jl")` before `include("module.jl")`, but `consts.jl` references `Config` which is defined inside `module.jl`. **Always read the full contents of a file before deciding where to insert it in the include chain.**

### 5. Test with normal precompilation, not just `--compiled-modules=no`

`--compiled-modules=no` skips `precompile.jl` entirely, hiding errors that only surface during real precompilation. **Run at least one test with normal (cached) precompilation** (`julia --project=... -e 'using Package'` without `--compiled-modules=no`) to catch precompile-specific failures.

### 6. Keep package tests in the package's own `test/` directory, not in `PlanarDev/test/`

When writing tests for a specific package (e.g., `Fetch`), put them in `/project/<Package>/test/runtests.jl`, NOT in `/project/PlanarDev/test/runtests.jl`. The PlanarDev test runner loads all packages via `PlanarDev.jl`, which changes the module resolution order and can mask missing-import errors (like `UndefVarError(:JSON3, ExchangeTypes)`). Running a package's own tests via `julia --project=PlanarDev Fetch/test/runtests.jl` loads only the required dependency graph, exposing import bugs that PlanarDev's unified test environment hides.

**Always move test groups from `PlanarDev/test/` into the individual package's `test/` directory when refactoring.**

### 7. Test environment setup: use `Pkg.develop` for local packages

When setting up a package's `test/Project.toml`, do NOT write it manually. Use Julia's Pkg:

```julia
# Start with a minimal test/Project.toml containing only:
# [deps]
# No name/uuid/version/authors header — those fields cause Pkg.test() to
# treat the test project as a package and fail precompilation.

# Then in Julia:
using Pkg
Pkg.develop([
    PackageSpec(path="/project/Foo"),           # the package under test
    PackageSpec(path="/project/Bar"),           # all local transitive deps
    PackageSpec(path="/project/Baz"),
])
Pkg.add(["HTTP", "JSON3", "DataFrames"])        # test-only extras
```

Then run: `julia --project=/project/Foo/test test/runtests.jl`

This ensures the test environment is isolated and catches import bugs that PlanarDev's wider manifest would mask.

**Always verify the test suite runs via `Pkg.test()` from the package root:** `julia --project=/project/Foo -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.test()'`. This is the standard Julia convention and catches environment mismatches that direct invocation can hide.

## Dependency Tree

See [`DEPENDENCY_TREE.md`](./DEPENDENCY_TREE.md) for the full tree (40 packages + 7 user strategies).

**Key rules:**
- Arrows point **downstream** (foundational → application-level). An upstream package must never `using` a downstream one.
- A package must list all directly-imported packages in its `[deps]`; accessing a module as `Dep.SubModule` is OK as long as `Dep` is in `[deps]`.
- `test/Project.toml` must have **no** `name`, `uuid`, `version`, or `authors` header.
- Test dependencies should be minimized via `const` aliases through already-loaded parent modules.
  - `Manifest.toml` paths must be relative to the `test/` directory, not absolute.

---

## Lessons Learned (2026-06-14 — Coverage & precompilation session)

### 8. Keyword parameter names must match when refactoring function calls

When refactoring a function call that passes keyword arguments through to another function, verify the parameter names match at every level. In `StrategyStats/src/slope.jl`, `slopefilter` accepted `window` as a keyword and passed it directly to `slopeangle(x; window)`, but `slopeangle` expected `n` not `window`. Any rename of a keyword parameter at one level must be mirrored at the call site with explicit mapping (`n=window`). **Always check the callee function's keyword signature before and after a rename.**

### 9. Entry file JULIA_NOPRECOMP removal must verify module declaration matches regex

When removing the deferred-loading `JULIA_NOPRECOMP` pattern from package entry files, some files have docstrings (via `@doc` or `"""..."""`) preceding the `module` declaration. A regex like `r"^(.*?)\bmodule\s+(\w+)"` will fail to match these. **Always handle docstring-prefixed module declarations — search for the `module` keyword directly rather than anchoring at line start.** Use `read` to verify the actual content structure before bulk-transform.

### 10. Test infrastructure with heavy dependency chains requires precompile-failure tolerance

Packages that depend on `Planar` (which depends on `Remote`, `LiveMode`, etc.) may fail to precompile in CI or fresh environments because strategy modules like `BareStrat` aren't available during precompilation. **Always wrap strategy-loading calls in precompile workloads with try/catch and fallback to `nothing`.** The `Remote` precompile workload previously hard-referenced `LiveMode.st.BareStrat` without first ensuring it was loaded — always use the safe pattern:

```julia
if !isdefined(ParentModule, :TheModule)
    try
        ParentModule.strategy_loader(:TheModule)
    catch e
        @warn "precomp: unavailable: $e"
    end
end
isdefined(ParentModule, :TheModule) || return
```
### 11. Cumulative counter deltas require clean window-boundary reference points

When computing incremental volume from an exchange's cumulative `baseVolume` (or `quoteVolume`), the reference point (`prev_base`) must be sampled **before** any trades in the target window. A common mistake is using the first ticker of minute N+1 as the "start of minute N" baseline — but that ticker already includes trades that settled in the last seconds of minute N (after the previous minute's last ticker). This causes both `prev_base` and `temp_candle.volume` to include the same late trades, cancelling them to zero.

**Symptoms:** Candle has OHLC movement (trades happened) but `volume=0.0` because the volume settled between the last ticker of the minute and the boundary.

**Fix:** Save `prev_base` from `diff_volume!`'s own output (`state.daily_volume = temp_candle.volume` after computing the previous minute's volume, which is the last ticker's baseVolume from that minute). Do NOT overwrite it with the first ticker of the next minute. Late trades are then captured as part of the next minute's volume — a 1-minute misattribution instead of complete loss.

**Audit technique:** For any code that computes `delta = snapshot_B - snapshot_A`, verify by tracing a concrete timeline that `snapshot_A` was taken **before** the event you're trying to measure. If the two snapshots overlap (both contain the same event), the delta will be biased low or zero. Draw a timeline with "ticker arrives" markers and "trade settles" markers, then check which markers each snapshot includes.

### 12. Trace the FIRST cycle through any guard change — initial-state edge cases are invisible in steady-state reasoning

When modifying or removing a guard condition, the steady-state behavior (second call, third call, ...) is easy to verify. The **first call** often has distinct dynamics because state fields hold their initial values (zeros, `nothing`, sentinel defaults). A guard that seemed redundant in the hot path may have been the **only** initialization path for a field.

**Example from the diff_volume! bug:** The `state.ticks == 0` guard saved the first ticker's `baseVolume` into `state.daily_volume`. It was removed because it caused late-trade cancellation in later cycles. But it was also the **only code path that ever initialized `state.daily_volume`** from its default of `0.0`. After removal, the first `diff_volume!` call found `prev_base=0.0`, entered the init guard, and returned `true` — but crucially, line 256 (`state.daily_volume = temp_candle.volume`) had already set `state.daily_volume` to the cumulative baseVolume before the init guard returned. Then `_ensure_contig!` pushed the candle with `temp_candle.volume` still holding that cumulative value (millions of BTC), because the init guard returned without zeroing it.

**Checklist before removing/adding any guard or fallback:**
1. What is the initial value of EVERY state field the code touches? Trace the first call with a concrete example.
2. If adding a fallback (e.g., `quoteVolume`), what happens when its baseline is `0.0` on the first invocation? Is the fallback guarded by another check, or does it produce a massive spurious value?
3. Does removing a guard create a new latent responsibility — is some other code path now responsible for initialization that didn't need to be before?
4. If a line runs "before the guard" (like line 256 running before the init guard returns), does it produce correct values when the guard fires? Or does it write garbage that another call will read?


### 13. Stale-check gap-fill overshoot silently drops candles — trace gap boundaries explicitly

The `_checkforstale` path in OHLCV ticker watchers calls `_ensure_contig!` unconditionally (even when `state.ticks == 0`), which pushes a candle seeded by `resetcandle!` with stale price data and `volume=0.0`. When a gap exists (e.g., 2 hours of missing data), the `_maybe_resolve` → `_ensure_ohlcv!` fetch uses `to = _nextdate(tf)` (= now + 1 period) as its upper bound, which overshoots the temp_candle's timestamp (`this_ts`). After the fetch, `_lastdate(df) > this_ts`, the adjacency check `isrightadj(this_ts, _lastdate(df), tf)` is always FALSE (direction is wrong — `this_ts` is *before* `_lastdate`), and the fallback `_lastdate(df) < temp_candle.timestamp` is also FALSE. **The candle is silently dropped.**

**Example from the stale-check push bug:** After a 2-hour gap (12:05→14:05):
1. `_checkforstale` at 14:05 finds the 12:05 candle ready to push (`state.ticks > 0`).
2. `_maybe_resolve` → `_ensure_ohlcv!` fetches from `lastdate(df)` (≈12:03) to `_nextdate(tf)` (≈14:06).
3. After fetch, `_lastdate(df) = 14:06`. The temp_candle timestamp is `12:05`.
4. `12:05 < 14:06` → the gap was filled but overshot. `isrightadj(12:05, 14:06, tf)` → FALSE (12:05 is before 14:06, not one period after). `_lastdate(df) < temp_candle.timestamp` → `14:06 < 12:05` → FALSE. **The 12:05 candle is never pushed.**
5. `resetcandle!` advances temp_candle to `14:05` — but the 12:05 candle is permanently gone from the view.
6. The 14:05 candle (flat OHLC, volume=0.0 from resetcandle!) gets pushed by the stale check or the next ticker path, creating a misleading row.

**The dual fix:**
- Guard `_ensure_contig!` with `state.ticks > 0` in the stale-check (`nothing` overload) path. A candle with no real ticker data should never be pushed — `resetcandle!` still advances the timestamp (avoiding a spin loop), but the empty candle is dropped. The next real ticker's `_ensure_contig!` → `_maybe_resolve` → `_ensure_ohlcv!` → `_fetchto!` fills the gap properly.
- In `_maybe_resolve`, after `_ensure_ohlcv!` fetches gap data, check if `_lastdate(df) > this_ts`. If so, the exchange data already covers this timestamp → return `k"stale_candle"` (don't push a redundant ticker-derived candle).

**Checklist for gap-related fixes:**
1. The `_ensure_ohlcv!` fetch bound is `_nextdate(tf)`, NOT `this_ts`. Any candle whose timestamp predates the newly fetched data will fail adjacency checks. Add an explicit `_lastdate(df) > this_ts` guard in `_maybe_resolve`.
2. A stale-check-created candle (`resetcandle!` with `price = temp_candle.close`) has `state.ticks == 0` — it was never populated by a real ticker. Never push such candles via `_ensure_contig!`.
3. When tracing gap behavior, start with a concrete timeline: "if last ticker at T and next ticker at T+Δ, which candles get pushed and which get dropped?" Don't assume the gap-fill works for all boundary cases.
4. After a gap-fill, `_lastdate(df)` may jump past the temp_candle timestamp. Check both `==` and `<` (not just `==`) when determining whether the temp_candle is redundant.

### 14. Gap volume baseline poisoning — guard `state.daily_volume` updates against stale-check candles

When a gap in ticker data exists (e.g., 2 hours with no tickers), the stale-check path creates candles via `resetcandle!` which sets `temp_candle.volume = 0.0`. The real ticker that arrives after the gap triggers `diff_volume!` for the stale-check-created candle. At that point, `state.daily_volume` is the cumulative `baseVolume` from the pre-gap diff (correct), but `temp_candle.volume` is `0.0` (from `resetcandle!`). Line 271 (`state.daily_volume = temp_candle.volume`) **poisons the baseline to `0.0`**, causing the NEXT diff_volume! call (for the first real post-gap candle) to enter the init guard (`prev_base=0`) and zero its volume.

**Example trace with the gap at 12:21→14:21:**
1. 12:21 diff: `state.daily_volume = baseVolume_12:21` (correct, set by the pre-gap diff).
2. Stale check at 14:05 creates a candle via `resetcandle!` → `temp_candle.volume = 0.0`, `state.ticks = 0`.
3. Ticker at 14:21:03 triggers new minute. `diff_volume!` for the 14:05 stale-check candle:
   - `prev_base = baseVolume_12:21` (correct).
   - Line 271: `state.daily_volume = temp_candle.volume = 0.0` ← **poisoned!**
   - `volume_diff = 0.0 - baseVolume_12:21 = negative → 0.0`. Volume is 0 for 14:05 — acceptable (stale data).
4. Ticker at 14:22:03 triggers new minute. `diff_volume!` for 14:21:
   - `prev_base = 0.0` ← **stale baseline!**
   - Init guard fires: `temp_candle.volume = 0.0`. Volume is 0 for 14:21 — **wrong** (OHLC shows price movement, trades occurred).

**The fix has two parts:**
- `state.ticks > 0` guard on line 271: only update `state.daily_volume` when the candle being pushed had real ticker data. A stale-check candle (`state.ticks == 0`) with `temp_candle.volume = 0.0` must not overwrite the valid pre-gap baseline.
- Gap detection with `state.last_diff_ts`: if `temp_candle.timestamp - last_diff_ts > period(tf)`, the baseline (`prev_base`) is stale. Zero the volume and reset the baseline.

**CORRECTION (2026-07-12):** The `state.ticks > 0` guard on `last_diff_ts` advance inside gap detection was WRONG. It caused `last_diff_ts` to remain at the pre-gap timestamp for the first post-gap candle (since `state.ticks == 0` from stale-check reset). The NEXT minute's `diff_volume!` then saw `last_diff_ts` still at the pre-gap value, entered gap detection a SECOND time, and zeroed volume for TWO candles instead of one. Additionally, the `state.ticks > 0` guard on `state.daily_volume = temp_candle.volume` was also wrong for the first post-gap ticker — it prevented the baseline from ever being updated from the stale pre-gap value. Combined with `temp_candle.volume = 0.0` from `resetcandle!` at that point, the baseline couldn't be safely updated anyway.

**The full fix (with both guards removed):**
1. Set `temp_candle.volume = ticker.baseVolume` BEFORE `diff_volume!` in the ticker path (line 359). This ensures the cumulative baseVolume is available when `diff_volume!` runs, even for the first ticker after stale-check reset (where `temp_candle.volume` was 0.0 from `resetcandle!`).
2. Remove `state.ticks > 0` guard from `state.daily_volume = temp_candle.volume` in `diff_volume!`. Now always updates the baseline because the caller sets `temp_candle.volume` to the current cumulative before calling.
3. Remove `state.ticks > 0` guard from `last_diff_ts` advance inside gap detection. Now always advances `last_diff_ts`, closing the gap after the first boundary candle.

**Result:** After the gap, only the boundary candle (e.g., 14:32) gets volume=0 from gap detection. The next candle (e.g., 14:33) computes `volume_diff = cum_14:34 - cum_14:33` normally. One zeroed candle replaces two.

**Checklist for gap-volume bugs (revised):**
1. Ensure `temp_candle.volume` is set to `ticker.baseVolume` BEFORE `diff_volume!` in the ticker path — `diff_volume!` needs the cumulative value for gap baseline recovery and `volume_diff` computation.
2. Never guard `state.daily_volume = temp_candle.volume` with `state.ticks > 0` — removing this guard requires condition (1) above so that `temp_candle.volume` carries the cumulative (not 0.0 from `resetcandle!`).
3. Never guard `state.last_diff_ts` advance with `state.ticks > 0` inside gap detection — the gap must be closed after the first boundary candle regardless of whether ticker data arrived. Only one candle should be zeroed for each gap.
4. Only the VERY first diff_volume! after watcher start (`prev_base == 0.0` from initialization) should enter the init guard — all subsequent zero-volume candles should be gap-boundary-only.
5. Verify: `state.daily_volume` transitions through the gap correctly: `pre_gap_cumulative → gap_boundary_cumulative (zeroed candle) → next_candle_cumulative`. If it skips the gap boundary, the next candle gets a delta spanning the full gap.


### 15. max_base tracking — capture baseVolume from ALL in-minute tickers, not just boundary triggers

The `diff_volume!` approach for ticker-derived OHLCV candles computes per-minute volume from the increase in the exchange's 24h rolling `baseVolume`. The original implementation used `volume_diff = trigger_N+1.baseVolume - trigger_N.baseVolume` (the boundary trigger ticker's baseVolume from consecutive minutes). This silently loses mid-minute baseVolume updates:

- **Problem:** When the exchange updates `baseVolume` between the trigger ticker of minute N and a later ticker of the same minute, the increase is never attributed because `diff_volume!` line 274 overwrites `state.daily_volume` with the TRIGGER's value at the next boundary, discarding the mid-minute high-water mark.
- **Result:** Minutes where the exchange updates baseVolume mid-minute still show volume=0 in the ticker-derived candle, even though the exchange DID report volume changes — they were just between boundaries.
- **Fix:** Track `state.max_base` — the maximum `baseVolume` observed from ANY ticker within the current minute. At each ticker update do `state.max_base = max(state.max_base, ticker.baseVolume)`. At `diff_volume!` time, use `curr_max = state.max_base` instead of `temp_candle.volume` (the trigger's snapshot). Reset `state.max_base = 0.0` after the diff.
- **Edge case — first boundary:** Before the first `diff_volume!`, tickers might not have fired yet. Initialize `state.max_base` in the boundary block (before `diff_volume!`) via `state.max_base = max(state.max_base, temp_candle.volume)`. This ensures `curr_max` is non-zero even for the very first boundary.

### 16. Exchange OHLCV volume fallback — preserve non-zero exchange candle volume

When the exchange's 24h rolling `baseVolume` genuinely doesn't change between two consecutive minutes (low-volume market, cached snapshots), the ticker-derived volume is 0 even though real trades happened (visible as OHLC price movement). The exchange's own OHLCV API returns accurate per-minute volume from trade-level data.

- **Problem:** `_ensure_contig!` unconditionally pushes the ticker-derived candle via `pushmax!`, even when the view already has an exchange candle at the same timestamp with non-zero volume. `pushmax!` appends a duplicate row, and the last (ticker) row wins in downstream processing.
- **Fix:** In `_ensure_contig!`, before pushing the ticker candle, check if exchange data at `temp_candle.timestamp` already has non-zero volume:
  ```julia
  idx = dateindex(df, temp_candle.timestamp)
  if idx > 0 && df[idx, :timestamp] == temp_candle.timestamp && df[idx, :volume] > 0
      temp_candle.volume = df[idx, :volume]
  end
  ```
  This overwrites the ticker-computed volume (which may be 0) with the exchange's accurate volume. The exchange row is then replaced by `pushmax!` (same timestamp), but now the pushed row carries the correct volume.
- **Limitation:** This only works when exchange OHLCV data EXISTS at the given timestamp (startup fetch or gap-fill has populated it). When `_ensure_ohlcv!` fails (stub exchange, no API support), the exchange volume fallback is a no-op and the view shows ticker-derived volume (which may be 0 for minutes with no baseVolume change).

**Checklist for volume-zero fixes:**
1. Verify `state.max_base` is updated at EVERY ticker (`state.max_base = max(state.max_base, ticker.baseVolume)` in the ticker path), not just at boundaries.
2. Verify `state.max_base` is initialized in the boundary block BEFORE `diff_volume!` — the first boundary needs a non-zero `curr_max`.
3. Verify `diff_volume!` reads `prev_base = state.daily_volume` and `curr_max = state.max_base`, then saves `state.daily_volume = curr_max` and resets `state.max_base = 0.0`.
4. Verify the init guard uses `curr_max` (not `temp_candle.volume`) for its `!iszero()` check.
5. Verify the gap-detection code still works: after `state.max_base = 0.0` reset, the next ticker rebuilds the max. A gap produces volume=0 for the boundary candle, then the next candle has volume from the rebuilt max.
6. If exchange OHLCV data is available for a timestamp but ticker-derived volume is 0, the exchange volume fallback in `_ensure_contig!` should rescue it. Test with a stub exchange that returns OHLCV data with non-zero volume.

## Lessons Learned (2026-07-13 — ccxt_ohlcv_tickers duplicate timestamp & flat stale candles)

### 17. Guard the OHLCV view's unique-timestamp invariant at the push site

The ccxt ohlcv tickers watcher can push two rows with the same timestamp when the
concurrent stale-check task (`_update_sym_ohlcv(w, nothing, ...)`, runs from
`_checkforstale`) and the ticker-processing task both finalize the same minute.
`resetcandle!` + `pushmax!` does not dedupe — `_push_unique!` must. But `dateindex`
in this codebase is `searchsortedlast`-style: for any `ts >= first(df.timestamp)`
it returns the index of the last row `<= ts` (so `dateindex(df, future_ts) > 0`
is ALWAYS true). **Confirming a timestamp already exists requires
`idx = dateindex(df, ts); idx > 0 && idx <= nrow(df) && df[idx, :timestamp] == ts`**
— never `dateindex(df, ts) > 0` alone (that blocks every legitimate new push).

### 18. Skip fully-flat candles (open==high==low==close) after a gap — in BOTH push branches

After a WS gap whose gap-fill fetch fails (stub exchange, no markets), the resume
tickers replay a stale price (often the exchange 24h-high) and produce fully-flat
candles (`63133.2 × 4`, volume 0/0.0007...). These are `resetcandle!` artifacts,
not real candles — pushing them paints a misleading flat row and (racing the
stale-check task) duplicates a timestamp. Skip them; an honest empty gap is better.

**The skip must live in `_maybe_push!` (called by both branches of `_ensure_contig!`),
NOT only inside the `res == k"stale_df"` branch.** `_maybe_resolve` falls through to
`return nothing` whenever `this_ts` is right-adjacent to `_lastdate(df)` (the normal
append case). So after the first gap candle is pushed, subsequent flat candles go
through the `isnothing(res) → isrightadj` branch, which had no guard — they were
being pushed. Centralize the degenerate-skip in `_maybe_push!` so it applies to every
push path. Keep the first-seed case (empty df) pushing.

### 19. Test-env source loading — validate edits against local source

`julia --project=Watchers/test script.jl` loads `Watchers` from the **depot/installed**
copy if the test `Project.toml`/`Manifest.toml` references it by UUID without a `path`.
A stale `.ji` then hides local source edits (the canonical `Pkg.test()` devs the local
package, so it sees them). To iterate on a scratch repro: either run via
`julia --project=Watchers -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.test()'`, `Pkg.develop` the package to its
local path in the test env, or delete `~/.julia/compiled/<ver>/Watchers/` so the edited
source recompiles. Debug `@info` lines inside a hot function may be swallowed by logging
filters — use a plain `println` or grep the full captured output.

### 20. History preload must tolerate gaps in exchange data — don't fatally throw

`_ensure_ohlcv!` (ccxt_ohlcv_tickers.jl) loads the view from the exchange's
historical OHLCV. Real exchange history can contain gaps — a minute with no
trades has no candle, so `16:00 → 16:02` (missing 16:01) is legitimate. The
watcher's contiguity check (`_do_check_contig(w, df, ::Val{:on})` →
`_contiguous_ts(..., raise=true)`) **throws** on any gap. When called directly
inside `_ensure_ohlcv!`, that throw aborts the whole preload, surfaces as
`_ensure_ohlcv! fetch failed ... Time series is not contiguous`, and (because the
prepend loop keeps retrying) spams the warning for every symbol on every
`start!(w)`.

`_fetchto!` already performs a non-fatal contiguity check (utils.jl wraps
`_check_contig` in try/catch and logs it). The `_do_check_contig` call in
`_ensure_ohlcv!` is therefore **redundant and fatal** — it must be made
tolerant. Wrap it so a gap is logged at `@debug` (not thrown): the preload
continues with an honest gap instead of aborting. An honest gap is preferable to
a failed load (see Lessons 17-18: fake-fill / flat-stale candles are worse than a
real hole). This applies to any history-preload / gap-fill path that re-checks
contiguity after `_fetchto!` has already appended the (possibly gappy) data.

### 21. Serialize `_ensure_ohlcv!` with `state.lock` — preload races the live path

`_ensure_ohlcv!` (history preload / gap-fill) mutates `w.view[sym]` via
`_fetchto!` → `appendmax!`/`prependmax!`, which do **not** dedupe by timestamp.
The live ticker path (`_checkforstale` → `_update_sym_ohlcv` → `_ensure_contig!` →
`_maybe_push!` → `_push_unique!`) holds `state.lock` and pushes to the same df.
If `_ensure_ohlcv!` runs **without** `state.lock` (the `_start!` preload loop called
it bare, `@acquire w.sem` only), the two run concurrently on the same df and
produce **one duplicate timestamp** in the view — exactly the symptom reported
after the duplicate-timestamp fix. `_load_ohlcv!` and the `_maybe_resolve` gap-fill
already wrap `_ensure_ohlcv!` in `@lock state.lock`; the `_start!` preload loop did
not, so it raced.

Fix: every `_ensure_ohlcv!` call site must hold `state.lock` (per-symbol), and as
defense-in-depth `_ensure_ohlcv!` ends with `_dedup_view!(df)` (drops adjacent
duplicate timestamps, view is timestamp-ascending). Keep the lock on all call
sites — a future caller that pushes without it reopens the race, and `_dedup_view!`
is the backstop. When adding a new `_ensure_ohlcv!` caller, wrap it in
`@lock state.lock @acquire w.sem`.
### 22. Use `JULIA_DEBUG=<baremodule>` to enable `@debug` traces in watchers and locks

The Watchers codebase instruments lock operations and watcher internals with structured
`@debug` log statements, each scoped to a `baremodule` that serves as a logging namespace.
Set `JULIA_DEBUG=<module>` (single) or `JULIA_DEBUG=<mod1>,<mod2>,...` (comma-separated)
before launching Julia to see these traces at runtime:

| Baremodule | Location | What it traces |
|---|---|---|
| `LogWatchLocks` | `Watchers/src/functions.jl` | Every `lock()`/`unlock()` on fetch and buffer locks, with caller frame |
| `LogOHLCVTickers` | `Watchers/src/impls/ccxt_ohlcv_tickers.jl` | OHLCV ticker watcher path: `_ensure_ohlcv!`, `_update_sym_ohlcv`, `_maybe_push!`, gap resolution, exchange volume fallback |
| `LogAverageOHLCV` | `Watchers/src/impls/ccxt_average_ohlcv_watcher.jl` | Average OHLCV watcher lifecycle: init, start, stop, fetch, process |
| `LogOHLCVWatcher` | `Watchers/src/impls/ccxt_ohlcv_candles.jl` | Candle watcher fetch/resync cycles |

**Common debugging invocations:**
```bash
# Trace every lock acquire/release on watcher operations
JULIA_DEBUG=LogWatchLocks julia --project=PlanarDev -e '...'

# Trace OHLCV ticker watcher detail (gap fills, volume fallback decisions, duplicate checks)
JULIA_DEBUG=LogOHLCVTickers julia --project=PlanarDev -e '...'

# Both combined
JULIA_DEBUG=LogWatchLocks,LogOHLCVTickers julia --project=PlanarDev -e '...'
```

**When to use each:**
- `LogWatchLocks` — stale-check fires at unexpected times? Two processes deadlock on the same
  symbol? The acquire/release trace pinpoints which caller holds the lock longest.
- `LogOHLCVTickers` — gap detection misfires, volume is zero or inflated, duplicate timestamps
  appear in the view, or `_ensure_ohlcv!` fails unexpectedly.
- `LogAverageOHLCV` / `LogOHLCVWatcher` — aggregate/candle watchers produce wrong data.

The `baremodule` approach means these traces are **zero-cost when disabled** — Julia's logging
machinery skips the `@debug` call entirely unless the env var matches. You can leave them in
production code without overhead.
### 23. Always use `now` from TimeTicks, never from Dates — timezone mismatch causes data corruption

`TimeTicks` overrides `now()` to return `Dates.now(UTC)` (see `TimeTicks/src/module.jl:14`).
Calling bare `now()` that resolves to `Dates.now()` instead returns **local wall-clock time**,
which diverges from UTC by the system timezone offset (e.g. +2 h on UTC+2 machines). Exchange
timestamps parsed by ccxt are always UTC, so a `now()` that returns local time silently
shifts every comparison and every buffer entry timestamp relative to real exchange data:

- **Buffer `.time` field**: entries stamped with local time while `ticker.timestamp` is UTC →
  2-hour apparent lag on the ticker, incorrect gap detection, spurious stale-check triggers.
- **Fetch ranges** (`_curdate`/`_nextdate`): `from` and `to` computed in local time but exchange
  data returned in UTC → `rangebetween` filters out valid rows or includes invalid ones.
- **Stale-check**: `latest_timestamp` from local `now()` compared with `lastdate(df)` (UTC) →
  the watcher always thinks the data is stale by the timezone offset.

**Rule**: every module that uses `now()` must ensure the binding comes from `TimeTicks`, not
`Dates`. The safest pattern is an explicit import at the top of each file:

```julia
using ..TimeTicks: now   # unambiguous, survives any re-export chain
```

Avoid bare `now()` without verifying the import chain. `Misc/src/ttl.jl` does
`using Dates: DateTime, Period, now` which can shadow the TimeTicks binding depending on
module load order. Do NOT rely on `using ..TimeTicks` alone — always pair it with a
dedicated `using ..TimeTicks: now` **after** other `using` statements to re-establish the
binding, or use `TimeTicks.now()` qualified calls in critical paths.

**When to verify**: any time you add a new file that calls `now()` in a time-sensitive path
(buffer pushes, fetch ranges, stale checks, gap detection), confirm the import chain
resolves to `TimeTicks.now()`. Running `JULIA_DEBUG=LogOHLCVTickers` and checking the
timestamps in the output against exchange timestamps is the quickest smoke test.
### 24. `using ...Dates: now` in any included file shadows `TimeTicks.now` for the entire module

When a file is `include`-d into a module, its `using` statements execute at the point of
inclusion and can **overwrite** existing bindings in the module's namespace. This is especially
dangerous for `now`:

```julia
# File A included early — sets up UTC now for the module:
using ..TimeTicks: now   # now = TimeTicks.now = UTC

# File B included later — silently shadows now to local:
using Fetch.Dates: DateTime, now   # now = Dates.now = LOCAL TIME
```

After File B is included, **every subsequent `now()` call in the module** resolves to local time,
including code in other already-included files when called at runtime. The overwrite takes effect
from the include point forward.

**Fix**: Never import `now` from a `Dates` path. Import `DateTime` (and other needed types) from
`TimeTicks` (which re-exports `Dates` correctly):

```julia
# BAD — shadows now for the whole module:
using Fetch.Dates: DateTime, now

# GOOD — safe, no now import:
using Fetch.TimeTicks: DateTime
```

**Audit finding (2026-07-14)**: All 12 production packages with bare `now()` calls resolve to
`TimeTicks.now()` (UTC). The only exception was `Watchers/src/impls/ccxt_average_ohlcv_watcher.jl`
which imported unused `now` from `Fetch.Dates` — fixed. The submodule `Misc/src/ttl.jl` (`TimeToLive`) uses `Dates.now` locally but the containment boundary prevents leakage.

### 25. `trim_to!` tail off-by-one violates strict-exclusive bounds (lesson #31/#43)

`Alignments.trim_to!` with `tail=true` used `is_right_adjacent(to, period)` (`x - step < to`) to find the cut point in the reversed view. The original `start = size - rev_idx + 1` deleted the **common timestamp itself** (`idx = start:size`), keeping only timestamps `< to`. With `strict=true` semantics (exclusive both sides for `rangebetween`, inclusive for trim's *keep*), the expected behavior is to keep `<= to`. The fix is `start = size - rev_idx + 2` with guard `start > size && return`, so only timestamps `> to` are removed. Head path (`x + step > to`, `1:stop-1`) was already correct (keeps `>= to`).

**Checklist:** For any `findfirst` on reversed timestamp array, verify the computed `start` resolves to `index_of_target + 1` (exclusive delete), not `index_of_target`. Write a concrete 4-row test `[00:00,00:05,00:10,00:15]` with `to=00:10` expecting `[00:00..00:10]` retained.

### 26. `propagate_ohlcv!` silent gap loss — always warn on non-adjacent or insufficient slice

`Processing.propagate_ohlcv!` (DataFrame overload) has three early-return paths that previously were silent: (a) `nrow(src_slice) < min_rows` after `rangeafter(src.timestamp, date_dst)` (gap shrank slice), (b) `isempty(new)` after resample, (c) `!isleftadj(date_dst, firstdate(new))` (resampled block not left-adjacent → gap larger than `dst_tf`). Path (a) lacked the `@warn` that path `nrow(src) < min_rows` had; path (c) returned `dst` unchanged with no log, mirroring Watchers gap lesson #49 where gaps must be explicit not silent. The fix adds `@warn` for (a) and (c) with `date_dst` and `firstdate(new)` context. `rangeafter` already uses `strict=true` (exclusive) correctly — do not change to `strict=false` to "fix" gap width.

**Checklist:** Every `return dst` / `return data` that skips an append due to contiguity must emit `@warn`/`@error` with both timestamps and timeframes, and respect `strict=true` exclusive bounds (`rangeafter(..., strict=true)`).
## Lessons Learned (2026-09-16 — Runtime Audit: Margin Mode × Hedge Mode × Exec Mode)

During the audit of all 15 combinations (3 margin modes × 2 hedge modes × 3 exec modes), the following issues were found and fixed:

### 27. Binance `marginmode!` override must forward `hedged` keyword correctly

The Binance-specific `marginmode!` override in `PlanarCore/src/Exchanges/adhoc/leverage.jl` accepted `hedged` as a keyword argument but had a method signature with a required positional `symbol` argument. The base `marginmode!` dispatch passes `symbol=""` by default, but the override required a positional argument, causing a method mismatch when called with keyword arguments.

**Fix:** Add a method with `symbol=""` default and ensure both `MarginMode` and raw string method variants properly forward the `hedged` keyword to the base implementation via `invoke`.

### 28. `singlewaycheck` must be exported from SimMode for cross-mode access

The `singlewaycheck` function (which enforces hedged/non-hedged position gating) was defined in `PlanarCore/src/SimMode/positions/call.jl` but not exported. PaperMode and LiveMode imported it via `using ..PaperMode.SimMode: singlewaycheck` or `using PlanarCore.SimMode: singlewaycheck`, but since it wasn't exported, this relied on internal module access which is fragile.

**Fix:** Export `singlewaycheck` from `PlanarCore/src/SimMode/module.jl` and update all imports to use `using PlanarCore.SimMode: singlewaycheck` for stable cross-mode access.

### 29. Cross-margin hedged liquidation requires per-side account-level check

The existing cross-margin liquidation test only covered non-hedged `Cross` mode. In `CrossHedged` mode, both long and short positions can be open simultaneously, and the account-level equity check (`_cross_account_covered`) must consider both sides. The logic in `_maybe_liquidate_positions!` already handles this correctly (iterates both sides when `ishedged(ii)`), but it lacked a test case.

**Fix:** Added explicit test `CrossHedged liquidation is account-level` in `test_margin_matrix.jl` that opens both long and short positions and verifies the funded account absorbs the liquidation risk for both sides.

### 30. Verify all 15 Margin×Hedge×ExecMode combinations construct without error

The margin matrix test (`test_margin_matrix.jl`) now iterates all 15 cells (5 margin modes × 3 exec modes) and validates:
- Strategy construction succeeds
- Correct instance type (`NoMarginInstance`, `MarginInstance`, `HedgedInstance`)
- `ishedged` flag propagates correctly from margin mode to instance
- Strategy's `marginmode()` matches the requested margin mode

This catches issues where a combination would pass type-checking but fail at runtime due to missing exchange capability checks or incorrect constructor dispatch.

**Best practice:** Run `julia --project=PlanarCore/test test_margin_matrix.jl` after any changes to margin/hedge/exec mode logic.

### 31. Binance sandbox mode should skip margin mode setup but return success

The Binance `marginmode!` override returns `true` immediately in sandbox mode without calling the gateway. This is correct behavior (sandbox doesn't need real margin mode setup), but it must still accept and forward the `hedged` parameter for API compatibility.

**Note:** The original override had `symbol` as a required positional argument, which broke when called with `symbol=""` default. The fix adds a compatible method signature.

### 32. LiveMode order/position paths must use stable SimMode imports

Both `Planar/src/LiveMode/orders/send.jl` and `Planar/src/LiveMode/positions/call.jl` imported `singlewaycheck` from `..PaperMode.SimMode` (a relative path through PaperMode's re-export). This creates an unnecessary dependency chain and is fragile if PaperMode's exports change.

**Fix:** Import directly from `PlanarCore.SimMode: singlewaycheck` in both files.
