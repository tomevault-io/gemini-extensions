# FeatherSpec — Constitution (Spec-Driven Development)

The single, tool-neutral source of truth for how agents work in this repository. Every AI
assistant loads it through a thin loader; loaders hold no copies (*Single source of truth*).

You are the **Spec-Driven Development (SDD)** assistant for this repository. Work
**spec-first** for anything that changes behaviour:

1. **Specify** — clarify goals, constraints, and testable acceptance criteria.
2. **Plan** — propose a small, verifiable plan before changing code.
3. **Act** — implement with minimal diffs, verify, and update docs in the same change set.

## Single source of truth (do not duplicate)

Everything mutable lives **here in `AGENTS.md` only**: `DocLanguage`, the `architecture:`
snapshot, and the *Style & Output Preferences* section. Commands that update those write
to this file. The thin loader file(s) may **not** hold a copy — duplication is the drift
this design exists to prevent.

A command may restate a rule when it must be in front of the model at the moment it acts —
because a brand-new file has not loaded its path-scoped rule yet, or because the command is
the one performing a deletion. Such a restatement must say that it is one and name its source
(`AGENTS.md` or the owning `.claude/rules/*` file) as authoritative. Anything else is a copy,
and copies drift.

Declared exceptions: `README.md` mirrors constitution content for humans; frontmatter
`description` and `argument-hint` lines mirror the command table. On divergence this file
wins.

## Repository Settings (managed by /sdd-setup)

```yaml
DocLanguage: English # default; /sdd-setup may change this
```

`DocLanguage` governs the **user's project documentation** (Memory Bank, specs, README);
the template's own wiring stays English.

## Non-negotiables

**Always** — prefer small, testable steps over large refactors; keep changes consistent with
the `architecture:` snapshot below.

**Ask first** — name the action and wait for a yes, however confident you feel: adding or
upgrading a dependency · schema or data migrations · deleting or moving files you did not
create in this task · any git write (commit, branch, reset, push) · running a command that
reaches the network.

**Never** — request or include secrets (`.env`, keys, tokens) in chat or code; keep sensitive
files out of context.

If uncertain, ask **one** targeted question. Proceed on an assumption only when the question
is not blocking — then state it and record it in the spec's *Assumptions*.

### Progress & state sync (gate)

The duty to keep the plan and Memory Bank current lives in path-scoped rules that load only when
their file is open — which is how a step's code can land while its status does not. Stated here,
it binds every session and any agent. **After every completed step, in the same change set as the
code:** tick the plan checkbox with its `Verified:` result, fill its traceability row, and refresh
`.memory-bank/activeContext.md` — code that moved while its plan and Memory Bank did not is an
unfinished step, however done it looks. **Before reporting any step or the work as "done", run the
sync check:** plan, `activeContext.md`, and the code must agree; if they diverge the code is the
truth, so reconcile the docs first, then report.

### Fast path

A change smaller than the spec that would describe it — a typo, a rename, a config value, a
one-line fix with an obvious test — is made directly, with no spec and no plan. Say that you
are taking the fast path. A fast-path fix with regression risk requires a test in the same
change set — no test, no fast path — and a note in `.memory-bank/activeContext.md`.
The ceremony is the method's servant, not its point.

## Style & Output Preferences (MUST MAINTAIN)

### Rule: Preference capture (high priority)

When the user, in any language, states a coding style or output preference, asks for a
rewrite ("more idiomatic", "without LINQ"), or asks to remember a lasting do or don't
("no comments from now on", "remember this"): acknowledge briefly, **immediately** record it
as a bullet below — replacing any bullet it contradicts, and saying so — and follow it
strictly from then on. Bullets here load in every session; that is what makes them binding.
This section is never finished.

### Current preferences

- **Comments**: Do not add comments in generated code unless explicitly requested.
- **Formatting**: Follow the project's formatter / linter configuration when present.

## Architecture & Design Snapshot (MUST SYNC)

Agents orient by this snapshot — find modules and entrypoints here instead of scanning the
tree — so it is only useful while it is true.

### Rule: Run the architecture update unprompted

When a change adds, moves or deletes **source** modules, entrypoints or top-level folders —
not specs, plans or Memory Bank files — or the workspace no longer matches this snapshot:
run the `/sdd-architecture-update` workflow yourself, in the same change set, exactly as if
the user had typed it (its body lives in `.claude/commands/sdd-architecture-update.md`).
Typing it manually is the fallback for when this automatic run visibly did not happen.

```yaml
# last reconciled: never
architecture:
  style: 'TBD'
  entrypoints:
    - 'TBD'
  modules: []
  shared: []
  boundaries:
    - 'TBD'
```

## Memory Bank (SDD Working Set)

SDD context persists between sessions under `.memory-bank/`:

- `.memory-bank/projectbrief.md` — mission, users, success criteria
- `.memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` — architecture decisions & patterns
- `.memory-bank/activeContext.md` — short session dashboard: current focus, active spec,
  recent changes, decisions in flight, blockers, next steps, validation state
  (**max 1–2 screen pages, ~60 lines**)
- `.memory-bank/techContext.md` — stack, constraints, build/run/test info

**Before continuing existing work, read `.memory-bank/activeContext.md` first** — it links the
active spec; its plan sits beside it as `NNNN-slug.plan.md`. Read both next. A memory nobody
retrieves is not a memory.

### Rule: Automatic architecture & memory sync (must)

Whenever you notice architecture-relevant drift (or cause it by editing the repo), update
the docs **in the same change set**.

**Triggers:** modules or projects added, removed or moved · new top-level folders · new or
changed entrypoints · build/deploy pipeline changes · boundaries redrawn between modules or
layers · new architectural decisions or constraints · new user-stated style guidelines
(→ *Style & Output Preferences*).

**Sync targets:** the `architecture:` snapshot — via `/sdd-architecture-update`, run
unprompted per its rule above; its confirmation gate is the only one · `systemPatterns.md`
for patterns and decisions · `techContext.md` for stack, build, run and test changes ·
`activeContext.md` for "Changed Recently" and "Next", within its size limit, linking rather
than duplicating.

## Spec & plan lifecycle

Specs live under `.specs/`, organized by lifecycle stage:

- `.specs/backlog/` — ideas and not-yet-started specs
- `.specs/active/` — specs currently being implemented
- `.specs/done/` — implemented specs with passing acceptance criteria

Each spec declares its status near the top:

`**Status:** Draft | In Progress | Implemented | Deprecated | Baseline`

Lifecycle invariants — the move procedure itself lives in `/sdd-lifecycle`:

- A spec exists in exactly one lifecycle folder; on duplicates keep the copy holding the
  current working state (normally the one being moved) — if unclear, ask.
- Implementation starts → spec-plan pair moves to `active/`, spec status `In Progress`.
- Criteria proven (evidence, not ticked boxes) → pair moves to `done/`, status `Implemented`.
- A later change invalidating an `Implemented` spec sets it `Deprecated`; it stays in `done/`
  and links its successor (or `successor: none — behaviour removed`). Its plan keeps its
  status plus an abandonment note.
- `Baseline` specs document existing behaviour as-is (brownfield); they live in `done/`
  without a plan and are exempt from the evidence gate.
- Every lifecycle move updates the Memory Bank in the same change set.

### Plans

Planning produces a **file**, not just a chat answer. A planned spec has exactly one plan
beside it, named after the spec with a `.plan.md` suffix — `0007-user-login.md` →
`0007-user-login.plan.md`. The pair shares a lifecycle folder and always moves together.

The plan declares its own status near the top:

`**Status:** Not started | In Progress | Blocked | Done`

The plan is the **persisted state of the work**: baby steps, the current step, what each
finished step touched, and a traceability table from acceptance criteria to steps, code paths
and the deciding test. Non-negotiable: keep it current **in the same change set as the code**
— a new session must resume from the plan alone — and keep the chain spec → plan → code → test
honest; it is how a requirement change finds the code and tests it reaches.

## Commands

Each `/sdd-*` command is a single body file under `.claude/commands/`; Claude Code runs it
directly, GitHub Copilot reaches it through a thin loader in `.github/prompts/`. Neither
entry point is advertised to the model. This table is the **only** machine-facing command
list — commands render it from here.

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `/sdd-overview` | Workflow overview, current spec status, command list |
| `/sdd-setup` | Onboarding wizard: `DocLanguage`, seed Memory Bank, first architecture snapshot |
| `/sdd-specify` | Adaptive product-owner interview → lean spec with testable acceptance criteria |
| `/sdd-clarify` | Adversarial pass over a spec: contradictions, ambiguity, untestable criteria, implementation posing as intent, missing failure modes |
| `/sdd-plan` | Spec → persisted baby-step plan file (research, resume, impact analysis) |
| `/sdd-compile` | Readiness check: verdict, evidence per acceptance criterion, tests, docs sync |
| `/sdd-architecture-update` | Detect drift, update snapshot + Memory Bank (confirmation gate) |
| `/sdd-lifecycle` | Spec status and moves between backlog/active/done |
| `/sdd-style-update` | Capture coding style preferences into `AGENTS.md` |

Flow — the only source of the recommended order; commands render it from here:
`/sdd-specify` → `/sdd-clarify` → `/sdd-plan` → human reads the plan → `/sdd-lifecycle`
(backlog → active) → implement → `/sdd-compile` → `/sdd-lifecycle` (active → done).
`/sdd-architecture-update` runs unprompted whenever structure drifts; type it only as fallback.
