# Frontend (React + TypeScript) - `src/`

Conventions for everything under `src/`. Repo-wide guidance lives in the root `CLAUDE.md`.

## JSX Conditional Rendering

**Avoid ternary operators in JSX.** Use early returns or `{condition && <Component />}` instead.

```tsx
// Good - early return
if (isLoading) return <LoadingState />;
if (error) return <ErrorState error={error} />;
return <Content />;

// Good - single-line conditional
{
  hasItems && <ItemList items={items} />;
}

// Bad - ternary in JSX
{
  isLoading ? <LoadingState /> : error ? <ErrorState /> : <Content />;
}
```

## Import Conventions

**Always import from barrel exports, never from subdirectories.** This keeps import paths stable and encapsulates internal structure.

- **Global components:** import from `@/components`, not `@/components/Button`, `@/components/Toast`, etc.
- **Modules:** import from `@/modules/{module}`, not `@/modules/{module}/components` or `@/modules/{module}/api`.

```ts
// Good
import { Button, IconButton, useToast } from "@/components";
import { ModCard, useInstalledMods } from "@/modules/library";

// Bad - reaches into internals
import { Button } from "@/components/Button";
import { useToast } from "@/components/Toast";
import { ModCard } from "@/modules/library/components";
```

## State Consumption - Hooks Over Prop Drilling

**Consume global state (hooks, queries, stores) directly in the component that needs it.** Do not drill Zustand state, TanStack Query data, or mutation callbacks through intermediate components as props.

- Patcher status → call `usePatcherStatus()` in the component that checks it
- Mod toggle/uninstall → call `useToggleMod()` / `useUninstallMod()` in `ModCard`, not passed from a parent
- Folder toggle → call `useFolderToggle()` in `FolderRow`/`FolderCard`, not received as a prop

TanStack Query deduplicates identical queries, so multiple components calling the same hook is efficient and correct.

**Exception:** Props are appropriate for coordinating parent-owned UI state (e.g., `onViewDetails` that opens a sibling dialog, `onReorder` where reorder target varies by context).

## Tauri Event Listening

For backend-to-frontend events (e.g., overlay progress), use `listen<T>()` from `@tauri-apps/api/event` in a `useEffect` with cleanup via `unlisten()`. See `modules/patcher/api/useOverlayProgress.ts` for the pattern.

## Routing

TanStack Router with file-based routing in `src/routes/`. Route tree is auto-generated in `routeTree.gen.ts`. The root route (`__root.tsx`) checks setup status and redirects to `/settings` on first run.

## Component Library (`src/components/`)

**ALWAYS use reusable components from `@/components` instead of native HTML or raw base-ui imports.** Module code should never import from `@base-ui-components/react` directly - all base-ui primitives must be wrapped in `src/components/` first. See `src/components/index.ts` for what is already wrapped.

When adding a new base-ui component:

1. Create wrapper in `src/components/NewComponent.tsx`
2. Export from `src/components/index.ts`
3. Import in modules via `@/components`, never from `@base-ui-components/react` directly

## Form System (`src/lib/form/`)

Uses `@tanstack/react-form` with Zod validation via `useAppForm()`. Field components are pre-registered on `form.AppField` / `form.AppForm` and integrate with the wrapped `@/components` primitives.

## Dependency Constraints

- `zustand` - client-side state only. Never use it for server state - that is TanStack Query's job.
- `framer-motion` - Layout animations for DnD (`AnimatePresence` on `DragDropOverlay` only). Tree-shake to ≤30KB gzipped.

## Icons

All icons come from `@phosphor-icons/react`, imported by PascalCase name. Standard spinner is
`<SpinnerGap className="animate-spin" />`.

`lucide-react` is still installed because most of the app still imports it, and it stays until those
call sites are converted. **Write no new lucide imports** - a file being touched for something else
is a fine moment to convert the icons in it.

Phosphor names things by shape rather than by role, so the lucide name is rarely the phosphor name:
`ChevronDown` is `CaretDown`, `Search` is `MagnifyingGlass`, `Settings` is `Gear`, `Trash2` is
`Trash`, `Loader2` is `SpinnerGap`. Look the name up rather than guessing.

Phosphor's `regular` weight is lighter than lucide's 2px stroke, so a converted icon reads thinner
beside one that has not been converted yet. Pass `weight="bold"` where an icon carries an action -
buttons, toolbar controls - and leave `regular` for decorative and section-header icons.

Riot's own marks are the exception, since neither icon set carries them. They live as inline-SVG
components in `src/components/icons/`, lifted from the League and Riot Client asset sets:
`LeagueIcon`, `RiotIcon`, `TftIcon`, and the cosmetics family `MaskIcon` / `ThreeMasksIcon` /
`EvolutionIcon`. That folder has its own barrel, re-exported by `src/components/index.ts` - call
sites still import from `@/components`.

Keep the path data untouched, and change only what stops it behaving like an icon: swap the client's
hardcoded fill (League gold `#C89B3C`, parchment `#F0E6D2`) for `currentColor`, drop any wrapping
`opacity`, and take `className` so the call site sets the size.

Check the artwork's bounds against its `viewBox` too. The client pads these for its own layout, so a
mark can sit at half the height of its box and read a size smaller than the icons beside it - crop
the `viewBox` to the artwork rather than compensating with a bigger `className` at each call site
(`MaskIcon` is the example).
Redrawing the paths to match the icon set's stroke weight is not worth it - at 16px the fill reads
fine next to a stroked icon, and a hand-traced mark is just a worse copy.

## Styling

Tailwind CSS v4 via `@tailwindcss/vite`. `src/styles/tailwind.css` is the **single CSS entry point** imported in `main.tsx`.

Inter is self-hosted through `@fontsource-variable/inter`, imported at the top of that entry point - a
packaged build has no network to fetch a webfont from. The family it registers is **`Inter Variable`**,
which is what `--font-sans` has to name; plain `"Inter"` alone silently falls through to `system-ui`.
Fonts are not interchangeable here: the system fallback is not metric-compatible, and its asymmetric
descent leaves text sitting low in its line box, which reads as icons and labels disagreeing about
where the middle of a button is.

**Design tokens** use numbered scales defined as CSS custom properties:

| Category   | Pattern            | Example                          |
| ---------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| Spacing    | `--space-{NNN}`    | `--space-004` → 24px (NNN × 6px) |
| Radius     | `--radius-{NNN}`   | `--radius-003` → 8px             |
| Icon sizes | `--icon-{NNN}`     | `--icon-003` → 16px              |
| Shadows    | `--shadow-{name}`  | `--shadow-sm`, `--shadow-glass`  |
| Z-index    | `--z-{name}`       | `--z-modal`, `--z-toast`         |
| Duration   | `--duration-{NNN}` | `--duration-004` → 200ms         |
| Easing     | `--ease-{name}`    | `--ease-spring`                  |

**Color tokens:** `surface-{50..950}` for neutrals, `accent-{50..950}` for the dynamic accent color (HSL-based via `--accent-hue`). Dark theme is default; light theme uses `[data-theme="light"]` attribute on `<html>`.

**Important:** `global.css` must NOT use `@apply` with Tailwind utilities - use raw CSS custom property references instead (e.g., `background-color: var(--surface-900)`).

Density modes are applied via `[data-density]` on `<html>` and affect `--space-*` and `--icon-*` only - never `--radius-*`, `--shadow-*`, `--z-*`, or colors.

## Text Selection

This is a desktop app, not a web page - selectable-by-default is the browser's assumption, not ours.
Chrome gets `select-none`; selection is reserved for text a user would want to take somewhere else.

The test is **whose text it is**. Text the app wrote about itself is chrome. Text that came from the
user, their disk, or the backend is data.

**Non-selectable** - put `select-none` on the container, not on each label:

- Framing chrome: title bar, session/status bar, toolbars, tab strips, sidebars, headers.
- Anything clicked rather than read: buttons, menu items, list/tree rows, cards, toggles. A
  drag across these leaves a stray highlight and fights click-drag interactions.
- Static prose the app authored: labels, hints, empty states, section descriptions, progress lines.

**Selectable** - leave the default alone:

- Names, paths, IDs and versions that came from the user, the filesystem or the backend.
- Error text and log lines someone will paste into a bug report.
- Long-form content meant to be read or edited: inputs, description bodies, changelogs, dialog
  detail panes.

`select-none` inherits, so data nested inside a `select-none` container needs `select-text` back.

Where copying is routine, give an explicit **Copy** action rather than leaning on selection - the
established pattern here (`CheckRow` for the fix command, `useModCardController` for the mod ID,
`WadScanFailedDialog` for its details, `Diagnostics` for the whole report).

## Reduce Motion

Three-option system applied via `[data-reduce-motion]` on `<html>`: System Default (follows OS `prefers-reduced-motion`), On, Off. Use `useReducedMotion()` from `@/hooks` for component-level checks.
