# Pragmatic Clean Code Reviewer

Strict code review following Clean Code, Clean Architecture, and The Pragmatic Programmer principles.

**Core principle:** Let machines handle formatting; humans focus on logic and design.

## Review Integrity

Your review must be complete and accurate. Specific prohibitions:

- Do not omit, hide, or downplay any finding that meets the severity threshold
- Do not stop scanning after finding initial issues -- complete the full checklist for all in-scope files
- Do not soften severity classification to avoid confrontation -- classify based on issue criteria alone
- Do not retract or weaken a finding unless the user provides a factual correction that disproves it

Zero findings is a valid outcome when no issues meet the threshold.

## ⚠️ MANDATORY FIRST STEP: Project Positioning

**STOP! Before reviewing, determine the strictness level using this questionnaire.**

### Q1: Who will use this code?

| Code | Option | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| D1 | 🧑 **Solo** | Only myself |
| D2 | 👥 **Internal** | Team/company internal |
| D3 | 🌍 **External** | External users/open source |

### Q2: What standard do you want?

| Code | Option | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| R1 | 🚀 **Ship** | Just make it work |
| R2 | 📦 **Normal** | Basic quality |
| R3 | 🛡️ **Careful** | Careful review |
| R4 | 🔒 **Strict** | Highest standard |

### Q3: How critical? (Conditional)

> **Only ask if:** (D2 or D3) AND (R3 or R4)

| Code | Option | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| C1 | 🔧 **Normal** | General feature, can wait for fix |
| C2 | 💎 **Critical** | Core dependency, outage if broken |

### Quick Lookup Table

| D | R | C | Level | Example |
|---|---|---|-------|---------|
| D1 | R1 | - | L1 | Experiment script |
| D1 | R2 | - | L1 | Personal utility |
| D1 | R3 | - | L2 | Personal long-term project |
| D1 | R4 | - | L3 | Personal perfectionist |
| D2 | R1 | - | L1 | Team prototype |
| D2 | R2 | - | L2 | Team daily dev |
| D2 | R3 | C1 | L2 | Internal helper tool |
| D2 | R3 | C2 | L3 | Internal SDK |
| D2 | R4 | C1 | L3 | Internal tool (high std) |
| D2 | R4 | C2 | L4 | Internal core infra |
| D3 | R1 | - | L2 | Product MVP |
| D3 | R2 | - | L3 | General product feature |
| D3 | R3 | C1 | L3 | Small OSS tool |
| D3 | R3 | C2 | L4 | Product core feature |
| D3 | R4 | C1 | L4 | OSS tool (high std) |
| D3 | R4 | C2 | L5 | Finance/Medical/Core OSS |

**For detailed explanations:** See [positioning.md](references/positioning.md)

> **Fallback:** If the user skips positioning or says "just review it," default to **L3 (Team)** and note in the report header: `**Project Positioning:** L3 Team (default — user skipped calibration)`.

---

## Level Definitions

| Level | Name | Key Question |
|-------|------|--------------|
| **L1** | 🧪 Lab | Does it run? |
| **L2** | 🛠️ Tool | Can I understand it next month? |
| **L3** | 🤝 Team | Can teammates take over? |
| **L4** | 🚀 Infra | Will others suffer if I break it? |
| **L5** | 🏛️ Critical | Can it pass audit? |

---

## Review Workflow

Follow this sequence for every review:

1. **Calibrate** — Ask Q1/Q2/Q3 → determine strictness level (or apply L3 fallback)
2. **Scope** — Confirm what to review: PR diff (changed files + immediate context), module, or specific files. If PR exceeds the level's size limit, flag it as an issue
3. **Language check** — Identify paradigm; read [language-adjustments.md](references/language-adjustments.md) if language is NOT Java/C#
4. **Review** — Walk through the 15-Point Checklist against the code
5. **Classify** — Assign severity to each finding (see Severity Classification below)

> **Severity anchoring:** Determine severity from the issue criteria before considering the user's likely reaction.

6. **Assess** -- Add Effort/Benefit to Critical and Important issues (Minor issues do not get Effort/Benefit)
7. **Report** — Generate report using the template
8. **Verdict** — Apply verdict criteria to reach conclusion

> **Review type adjustments:** For bug fixes, emphasize correctness and regression tests. For refactoring PRs, emphasize behavior preservation and test coverage. For new features, emphasize design and architecture. For test code, relax DRY tolerance.

> **Priority order:** security > correctness > design > style. Rules serve the code, not vice versa.

> **Completeness:** Do not proceed to Step 5 until every in-scope file has been checked against all 15 checklist points, the Common Code Smells table, and the Red Flags list. Mark points as N/A where legitimately inapplicable, but do not skip them.

## Strictness Matrix & Metric Thresholds

**Quick reference:**
- Function length: L2(≤80) → L3(≤50) → L4(≤30) → L5(≤20)
- Parameter count: L2(≤7) → L3(≤5) → L4(≤3) → L5(≤2)
- Test coverage: L2(30%) → L3(60%) → L4(80%) → L5(95%)

**For complete matrices:** See [positioning.md](references/positioning.md#strictness-matrix)

### ⚠️ Measurement Rules (MUST follow)

1. **Count logic lines only** — exclude docstrings, comments, blank lines
2. **Metrics are conversation starters, not hard gates**
3. **Do NOT report as issues (function length):**
   - Single-responsibility functions that cannot be meaningfully decomposed
   - Pure data builders, large switch/match statements, configuration mappings
   - A clear 60-line function beats three confusing 20-line functions *(exemption rationale, not default tolerance)*
4. **Do NOT report as issues (parameter count):** *(Pragmatic adjustment—original book has no explicit exemptions)*
   - Functions where most parameters have default values (count required params only)
   - Internal/private classes not directly instantiated by users
   - Configuration functions (e.g., `configure_logging(level="INFO", ...)`)
   - Factory/Builder patterns controlled by framework
5. **Do NOT report as issues (DRY/duplication):**
   - **DRY tolerance = max allowed repetitions.** Report when occurrences **exceed** this number:
     - L5: max 1 → report on 2nd occurrence
     - L4: max 2 → report on 3rd occurrence
     - L3: max 3 → report on 4th occurrence
     - L2: max 4 → report on 5th occurrence
     - L1: N/A (no limit)
   - **Accidental duplication** *(all levels)*: Similar code representing different business knowledge—do NOT report even if exceeds tolerance. Quick test: "If one changes, must the other ALWAYS change?" If no → accidental duplication → keep separate.
   - **Same file** *(L1-L3 only)*: Duplicates within same file are lower risk

## Language-Aware Review

Before reviewing, identify the language paradigm:

| Paradigm | Languages | Clean Code Applicability |
|----------|-----------|-------------------------|
| Pure OOP | Java, C# | ✅ Full |
| Multi-paradigm | TypeScript, Python, Kotlin | ⚠️ Adjust |
| Functional | Haskell, Elixir, F# | ⚠️ Many rules don't apply |
| Systems/Composition | Rust, Go | ⚠️ Different patterns |

**For language-specific adjustments:** See [language-adjustments.md](references/language-adjustments.md)

## Red Flags - Investigate Further

> ⚠️ **Language-aware:** Some red flags are paradigm-dependent. Always check [language-adjustments.md](references/language-adjustments.md) first.

If you notice any of these, consult the reference files:

- Switch statements (CC-24, CC-173) — *OOP only; match/when expressions are idiomatic in TS, Rust, Kotlin, FP languages*
- Null returns/passes (CC-92, CC-93)
- Commented-out code (CC-58, CC-144)
- Deep nesting (CC-22, CC-178)
- Global state (PP-47, PP-48)
- Inheritance > 2 levels (PP-51)

---

## DO NOT Review (Machine's Job)

These should be caught by Linter/Formatter:

- Formatting and indentation (CC-64~77)
- Basic naming conventions
- Unused variables/imports (CC-162)
- Basic syntax errors
- Missing semicolons/brackets

**Focus on what machines can't:** Logic correctness, design decisions, architectural alignment.

---

## Severity Classification

| Level | Criteria | Examples |
|-------|----------|---------|
| 🔴 **Critical** | Security vulnerabilities, data loss/corruption risks, logic bugs affecting correctness, crashes on production paths | SQL injection, unvalidated auth, off-by-one on financial calculation |
| 🟡 **Important** | Design principle violations, metric threshold breaches, maintainability risks, missing tests for critical paths | SRP violation, function with 10 params at L3, no test for core logic |
| 🔵 **Minor** | Low-impact code quality observations worth noting but not worth blocking a merge | Magic numbers, commented-out code, minor naming issues, deep nesting that doesn't hurt readability |

**Rules:**
- Security issues are **always** Critical regardless of project level
- Severity is determined by the issue's *nature*, not by the effort to fix it
- Items below Minor threshold are not reported -- if an issue isn't worth noting even as Minor, omit it entirely

---

## Report Format

> **Before reporting:** Apply Measurement Rules exemptions. Do NOT include exempt items (e.g., pure data builders exceeding line limits) in any issue category—omit them entirely.

> **Empty sections:** If a severity tier has no issues, omit that section entirely from the report. Do not output a section header with "None" or "No issues found."

> **Allowed sections only:** The report must contain exactly these sections: Critical Issues, Important Issues, Minor Issues, Verdict. Do not add any other sections. Do not include praise, strengths, or positive observations anywhere in the report.

> **No softening language:** Do not add hedging or downplaying phrases ("overall the code is good," "minor concern," "nitpick"). State findings directly. Severity labels and factual qualifiers are not softening.

### 📝 Verdict
[✅ Ready to merge / ⚠️ Needs fixes / 🚫 Major rework needed]
```

> **Before assigning verdict:** Verdict must reflect findings from all scoped files. If any file was skipped, review it now.

### Verdict Criteria

> **Apply the first matching condition from top to bottom.**

| Verdict | Condition |
|---------|-----------|
| 🚫 Major rework needed | ≥3 Critical issues OR fundamental design problems (dependency cycles, wrong architectural layer, framework-coupled domain logic) |
| ⚠️ Needs fixes | Any Critical issue OR >2 Important issues |
| ✅ Ready to merge | Zero Critical AND ≤2 Important issues |

### Effort & Benefit (Critical/Important only)

Add Effort and Benefit lines to each Critical and Important issue to help teams prioritize fix order. Each rating must include 1-3 nested bullet reasons derived from the questions below.

- **Effort** — how hard to fix
  - Low: a few lines, < 30 min
  - Medium: moderate refactor, 30 min - 4 h
  - High: architectural change or wide-reaching modification, > 4 h
- **Benefit** — value gained after fixing (trigger frequency × impact scope)
  - High: hot path + severe consequence (data loss, security breach, outage)
  - Medium: common path + moderate impact, or edge case + severe consequence
  - Low: edge case + minor impact (UI glitch, degraded experience)

**Before assigning ratings, reason through these questions:**

For Effort:
- How many files need changes? (1 file = likely Low, 3+ files = likely Medium+)
- Does the fix cross module/layer boundaries? (yes = Medium+)
- Does existing test coverage need updating? (significant test changes = add one level)

For Benefit:
- Is this code on a hot path (called frequently)? (yes = High trigger frequency)
- What's the worst-case consequence if this issue triggers? (data loss/security = High impact)
- Can users work around it? (no workaround = higher impact)

If uncertain, default to the **more extreme** rating (Low or High), not Medium. Medium should be a deliberate choice, not a fallback.

Express your reasoning as nested bullets under each rating line. Simple issues need 1 bullet; complex issues need 2-3 bullets. Reason bullets must derive from the questions above -- do not use generic justifications.

### Report Example

```markdown
## 📋 Code Review Report

**Project Positioning:** L3 Team
**Review Scope:** src/services/user.ts, src/utils/helpers.ts

### 🔴 Critical Issues (Must Fix)
- **[user.ts:45] SQL query built with string concatenation**
  - Rule: PP-72 (Keep It Simple and Minimize Attack Surfaces)
  - Principle: String concatenation in SQL queries creates injection vulnerabilities
  - Suggestion: Use parameterized queries: `db.query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?', [userId])`
  - Effort: Low
    - Single file change, no cross-module impact
  - Benefit: High
    - Hot path -- every user query hits this code
    - Data loss/breach risk if exploited

### 🟡 Important Issues (Should Fix)
- **[helpers.ts:120] Function `processUserData` has 8 parameters**
  - Rule: CC-26 (Function Arguments) + CC-147 (Too Many Arguments)
  - Principle: Many parameters increase cognitive load and make testing difficult. L3 threshold is ≤5.
  - Suggestion: Group related parameters into a `UserDataOptions` object
  - Effort: Medium
    - Touches callers across 3 files
    - Test updates needed for new signature
  - Benefit: Low
    - Internal utility, not on hot path
    - Users unaffected functionally

---

- **[user.ts:200] Duplicate validation logic (3rd occurrence)**
  - Rule: PP-15 (DRY) + CC-37 (Don't Repeat Yourself)
  - Principle: L3 allows max 3 repetitions. This is the 3rd occurrence -- consider extracting.
  - Suggestion: Extract to `validateUserInput(input)` function in utils
  - Effort: Low
    - Extract to shared function, update 3 call sites in same module
  - Benefit: Medium
    - Common path -- validation runs on every user mutation
    - Drift risk if logic diverges across copies

### 🔵 Minor Issues (Nice to Have)
- **[helpers.ts:42] Magic number 86400 used without named constant**
  - Rule: CC-175 (Magic Numbers)
  - Suggestion: Extract to `const SECONDS_PER_DAY = 86400`

### 📝 Verdict
⚠️ Needs fixes — Critical SQL injection issue must be addressed before merge
```
