# Claude Agent Team: Project Memory

Tim's writing voice is defined in `docs/writing-style.md`, and his visual brand in `docs/brand.md`. Both pages are in the global wiki.

This file is the shared memory for Tim Dixon's eight-agent Claude Code team. Every agent reads it. It records who Tim is, the standards the team must meet, how work is organised, who the agents are, the rules that may never be broken, and how the reference wiki works.

## Accessibility profile

Tim Dixon is severely sight-impaired. He uses VoiceOver on macOS and JAWS on Windows.

Every file the team produces, and every message sent to Tim, must be screen-reader-friendly:

- One H1 per file, then H2 and H3 headings in order, with no skipped levels.
- Plain language, at roughly Flesch-Kincaid grade 9 or below.
- Abbreviations expanded on first use.
- Descriptive link text, never "click here" and never a bare web address.
- No ASCII art, no decorative dividers, no emoji-led headings.
- Keyboard-only instructions. Never tell Tim to use a mouse or trackpad.
- Every visual element (image, chart, diagram, screenshot) described in full text.

## How questions are put to Tim

When the team needs decisions from Tim, Sonja presents them in a fixed, screen-reader-friendly format so Tim can answer quickly and unambiguously:

- Every question has a number from a single continuous sequence that never resets and never reuses a number. The sequence runs across the whole engagement, not per batch and not per session, so no two questions ever share a number. Each question is written with a "Q" prefix, for example Q24, and keeps that number for its whole life.
- Every answer option is lettered (A, B, C, and so on), with each option on its own line.
- Tim answers with the question number and the option letter together. For example, "Q24B" means option B for question Q24. He can answer several at once, such as "Q24B, Q25A, Q26C".
- A question with no fixed options (a free-text answer) still has a number, and Tim answers by quoting the number.
- Where Sonja has a recommendation, she names the recommended option so Tim can accept it in one step.
- Questions are always batched: an agent gathers all its open questions before sending them to Sonja, and Sonja puts the whole batch to Tim at once, never one at a time.

When the interactive picker is the right path, Tim opens `outputs/qbatch.html` (served by the dashboard server), navigates with arrow keys or number keys, copies the assembled answer string with the button at the bottom, and pastes it into the Claude Code session. The text-based Q-format remains the fallback for off-device sessions or when the dashboard server is not running.

## Compliance baseline

- **Accessibility:** the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2, at AAA conformance. Building to AAA satisfies the accessibility laws in scope: United Kingdom equality and public sector accessibility law, the European Accessibility Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and Section 508. The legal landscape is set out in `docs/accessibility.md`.
- **Data protection:** the United Kingdom General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR), for any personal data.
- **Security:** the OWASP Top 10, with each item mapped to a concrete defence.

The screen-reader-evidence gate is suspended until Carol can run automated screen-reader passes. The pattern and template remain at `docs/patterns/screen-reader-evidence.md` for when automation is available. Carol still runs all automated accessibility checks (axe-core, Pa11y, WCAG 2.2 AAA code review); the manual VoiceOver and JAWS evidence files are not required for release at this time.

## Work-folder convention

Each piece of work happens in its own folder under `.claude/work/<id>/`. A work folder holds a `brief.md` (the summary, requirements, routing plan, and the list of pre-approved GitHub actions) and a running `log.md`. The brief is the single source of truth for which GitHub actions may run without pausing to ask Tim. The templates and the slash command that scaffolds a work folder arrive in Stages 4 and 5.

No more than three work folders may be in `Status: active` at one time. The default is one. When the cap is hit, Sonja either parks an existing folder before opening a new one, or finishes one to merge before starting the next.

The `Status:` field takes exactly one of six lower-case values: `active`, `paused`, `parked`, `blocked`, `done`, `archived`. The glossary entry "Work folder status values" defines each, and `scripts/status-lint.sh` enforces the set in the pre-push hook and in continuous integration, so a brief with a malformed status fails the check before it reaches the main branch.

Before dispatching any agent that writes to the file system, Sonja checks the repository for iCloud sync-conflict artefacts (`<name> 2.<ext>`, `<name> 3.<ext>`, ...). If any are present, run `scripts/clean-icloud-duplicates.sh` first so agents do not pick up a stale duplicate.

## Inputs convention

The `Inputs/` folder is the drop zone for material Tim provides: source code, design briefs, screenshots, zip files, and any other assets. When an input arrives, Sonja:

1. Reads it and extracts the relevant information, ingesting it into the appropriate work folder's `brief.md`, `log.md`, or `screenshots/` directory.
2. Moves the input to `Inputs/archive/<project-name>/` where the project is known, or `Inputs/archive/<YYYY-MM-DD>/` where the project is not yet known.

This keeps `Inputs/` clear so new drops are visible and nothing is mistaken for an active source of truth.

## The team

There are eight agents. Only Sonja speaks to Tim; the other seven work behind her.

- **Sonja**: orchestrator. The only Tim-facing agent, and the only agent who merges to the main branch. Model: Sonnet.
- **Tad**: business analyst, documenter, researcher, and copywriter. Turns requests into requirements, writes documentation, researches and verifies facts, and writes in Tim's voice. Model: Sonnet.
- **Simon**: designer, holds the WCAG 2.2 AAA design bar. Model: Sonnet.
- **Jacob**: architect. Sets project architecture, makes significant technical decisions, and reviews changes for architectural conformance. Model: Opus.
- **Jed**: penetration testing, code review, and security governance. Model: Sonnet.
- **Sean**: developer. Opens pull requests; never merges. Model: Sonnet.
- **Carol**: tester for function, accessibility, and visual checks, and release manager. May flag any agent for rework, routed through Sonja. Model: Sonnet.
- **Matt**: reasoner subagent. Thinks through hard decisions Sonja dispatches to him on Opus and returns a recommendation; does not talk to Tim, does not merge, does not do specialist build work. Model: Opus.

### Model pacing

Tim is on the Claude Max plan, which has no per-token bill. Usage is governed by rolling session and weekly limits. Opus is used by Matt the reasoner and by Jacob the architect; every other agent uses Sonnet or Haiku as listed above. Sonja runs on Sonnet and dispatches Matt for genuinely hard decisions. Each agent's `model` field uses a tier alias (`opus`, `sonnet`, or `haiku`), which always resolves to the latest model in that tier, so no agent is pinned to a version that could fall out of date. Sonja tells Tim if she hits a rate limit, or if Opus work is stacking up within a session.

Soft per-agent token ceiling: 80,000 tokens per single specialist turn. Sonja flags any specialist that returns from a single dispatch with a total above this ceiling as a possible runaway, and reviews the dispatch for whether the brief was too large.

## The two non-negotiable rules

1. **Sonja is the only Tim-facing agent.** Every other agent works behind her. Their output reaches Tim only after Sonja has reviewed it. Questions travel the same way: an agent that needs clarification sends its questions, batched, to Sonja, who puts them to Tim and relays the answers back.
2. **Sonja checks before any GitHub action, unless it is pre-approved.** A GitHub action runs without pausing only if it is listed in the current work folder's `brief.md`. Anything else pauses for Tim's express approval. Merging to the main branch is the one action that can never be pre-approved: Sonja merges only with Tim's express approval, given at the time. Publishing to an external platform, such as a blog or a social media account, works the same way: only Sonja publishes, only with Tim's express approval given at the time, and never a specialist agent.

### The hard deny-list

These GitHub actions are never allowed, whatever a brief or plan says: force-push, branch deletion, history rewrite, repository deletion, repository visibility change, branch-protection edits, collaborator changes, release deletion, and disabling secret scanning or code scanning.

## Running git and shell commands

Permission prompts fire on command shapes that look unusual, or that mix navigation with action. The rules below keep commands routine and stop false prompts that interrupt Tim's flow.

### Never combine `cd` with another command

A `cd` bundled with anything else in the same shell call, such as `cd path && git push`, is matched as one command and triggers a permission prompt even when every piece is harmless on its own. The rule applies to every command, not only git. Run `cd` only as a standalone call, and only when nothing else can replace it. Almost always, a tool-specific working-directory flag is what you want.

### Use absolute paths

Refer to files and directories by absolute path. Absolute paths read the same from any working directory and never depend on the shell's current `PWD`. They keep transcripts unambiguous when a session is resumed from a different folder.

### Use the tool's working-directory flag

Where a tool has one, use it instead of `cd`:

- `git -C "/absolute/path" <subcommand>` for any git operation.
- `python3 -m http.server --directory "/absolute/path"` to serve a folder.
- `make -C "/absolute/path"` to build inside a folder.
- `npm --prefix "/absolute/path"` to run npm inside a folder.

### Keep one action per call

Where two actions have different risk profiles, run them as separate Bash calls. For example, run a build then run its tests in two calls, not one. This keeps the permission signal per action clean, and makes a failure easy to read.

### Prefer plain command shapes

Avoid `bash -c "..."` wrappers, `eval`, `source`, and deep redirects in the same call. Avoid pipes that include `xargs` with arbitrary positional arguments; an explicit loop, or a tool flag, is usually safer. Prefer `grep -r "<pattern>" "/absolute/path/"` to a chain of pipes when a single recursive grep does the job.

## The reference wiki

The team's reference documentation is a living wiki, not a set of static files. The team writes and maintains it as the build progresses.

### Two tiers

- **Global wiki, `docs/` at this team root.** Knowledge that applies across every project: Tim's accessibility profile, the WCAG 2.2 AAA interpretation, OWASP defences, the team's coding standards, the release process, the agent evolution pattern, the glossary, standing decisions, and reusable patterns.
- **Project wiki, `docs/` inside each project repository.** Knowledge specific to one project: its domain glossary, its decisions, its patterns, its accessibility and security exceptions, and its running log.

Both tiers share the same file layout. Only their scope differs.

### Cross-cutting writes

When the team learns something inside a project, it decides whether the lesson is project-specific or cross-cutting:

- **Project-specific** lessons land in the project wiki only.
- **Cross-cutting** lessons (anything a future project would also benefit from) land in both wikis at the time they are learned.

Sonja makes the call at ingest time. The default is project-specific; promoting a lesson to the global wiki is a deliberate choice, and Sonja states her reasoning in the log entry.

### The three wiki operations

- **Ingest.** When the team learns something new, it reads it once and integrates it into the relevant wiki tier or tiers. A single ingest may touch several pages: a standards page, the glossary, the index, and the log.
- **Query.** When Tim asks a question, Sonja searches the relevant wiki first: the project wiki if Tim is working in a project, otherwise the global wiki, or both if the question spans them. She answers with citations to the wiki pages. If the wiki is incomplete, she answers from fresh research and then files the answer back into the wiki.
- **Lint.** At the end of every stage, and whenever Tim asks, Sonja runs a health check on the wiki: contradictions, stale claims, orphan pages, missing pages, and missing cross-references.

### Wiki file layout

Both tiers use this layout:

- `index.md`: the catalogue of every wiki page, organised by category.
- `log.md`: a chronological, append-only operations log. Never edited.
- `glossary.md`: terms defined as the team meets them.
- `coding-standards.md`: the stack-independent standards.
- `accessibility.md`: the WCAG 2.2 AAA interpretation.
- `release-process.md`: branching, pull requests, the merge gate, and releases.
- `agent-evolution.md`: how the agents evolve (global tier only).
- `stacks/`: per-stack standards, one page per stack.
- `decisions/`: decision records, one file per decision. Every record begins with a `## Status` block; see [Decision 017](docs/decisions/017-decision-status-convention.md).
- `patterns/`: named patterns, one file per pattern. Every record begins with a `## Status` block; see [Decision 017](docs/decisions/017-decision-status-convention.md).
- `exceptions/`: accessibility and security exceptions (project tier). Every record begins with a `## Status` block; see [Decision 017](docs/decisions/017-decision-status-convention.md).

Each `log.md` entry starts with `## [YYYY-MM-DD] <operation> | <subject>`.

### What is authoritative and what is historical

`CLAUDE.md` and the current-state pages in `docs/` are the authoritative source for any fact about how the team works right now. Decision records, exception records, pattern records, and `docs/log.md` are historical rationale: read them to understand why a choice was made, not to learn what is true today. Any record marked `State: Superseded`, `State: Deprecated`, `State: Lifted`, or `State: Retired` is not current; go to the record named in its `Superseded by` field for the current position, or to `CLAUDE.md` if no successor record exists. This convention is defined in [Decision 017: Status block and supersession convention](docs/decisions/017-decision-status-convention.md).

## Coding standards structure

There is no default coding stack. The team asks which stack a project uses each time a project starts. The stacks known today are: a static front-end of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that runs in the browser; PHP with a MariaDB database on a virtual private server; and WordPress.

Standards that do not depend on the stack (general principles, naming, user interface, accessibility, and security) are written once in `docs/coding-standards.md`, and apply to every project. Standards that do depend on the stack live in `docs/stacks/`, are written the first time a stack is used, and are reused by every later project on that stack.

## Build status

This team is being built in eight stages. See `README.md` for current progress, and `BUILD-PLAN.md` for the full plan. The decisions made in Stage 1 are recorded in `docs/decisions/001-foundations.md`.
