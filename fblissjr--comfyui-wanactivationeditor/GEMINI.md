# WanVideo Activation Editor Project

## Code and Writing Style Guidelines

- **No emojis** in code, display names, or documentation
- Keep all naming and display text professional
- Avoid "Enhanced", "Advanced", "Ultimate" type prefixes - use descriptive names instead
- Clean, simple node names that describe what they do
- Stay professional and concise in writing and in code
- Simplify and clean up code where possible
- Be concise in README.md and other documentation except when detail is important. Avoid the 'no shit' parts of READMEs and keep the tone professional and to the point and direct. No hype or hyperbole.

## Overview
This project implements block-level activation editing and vector arithmetic operations for WanVideo models through ComfyUI nodes. It allows injecting alternative text conditioning into specific transformer blocks and performing mathematical operations on embeddings to create novel effects.

## Current Status
The runtime patching system is fully functional and activation injection is confirmed working. Testing shows the injection successfully replaces context in activated blocks with strength=1.0.

**What's Working:**
1. Runtime patching of all 40 transformer blocks
2. Forward method interception confirmed during generation
3. Context parameter successfully captured (shape: [1, 512, 5120])
4. Injection successfully replaces context when strength=1.0
5. Block-level activation configuration stored correctly
6. Vector arithmetic operations with automatic shape alignment
7. DuckDB storage with compression (3-4x reduction)
8. Memory-efficient operations preventing VRAM leaks
9. Debug system with runtime log level control

**Key Insights from Testing:**
- With strength=1.0, context is completely replaced by injection embeddings
- Context norm varies significantly between prompts (18.2 vs 106.8 observed)
- Injection norm remains consistent (~23.2)
- Post-projection differences vary (1.2% to 22.6%) due to projection normalization
- The system is working correctly - injection replaces context as designed

**Recent Fixes:**
- Fixed model path discovery (`model.blocks` instead of `transformer_blocks`)
- Fixed forward method signature for WanAttentionBlock
- Added `@torch.compiler.disable` to prevent torch dynamo issues
- Simplified debug system with built-in console output
- Fixed all `verbose_only` parameter errors
- Added runtime log level control in WanVideoActivationEditor node
- Added injection mode selection (context vs hidden states vs both)
- Added WanVideoInjectionTester for debugging effectiveness

**Understanding the Projection Issue:**
The text_embedding layer normalizes embeddings differently based on content:
- Same prompts can have vastly different norms after projection
- This affects how much "difference" is measured post-projection
- But injection still works - it replaces the context regardless

**Solutions for Better Control:**
1. **Embedding Amplifier**: Ensures raw embeddings differ by target amount
2. **Projection Booster**: Amplifies differences after projection
3. **Latent Encoder/Injector**: Bypasses projection using model's internal representations
4. **Direct Injector**: Forces specific difference levels in context

**Next Steps:**
- Experiment with different prompts and strengths
- Document which blocks produce which effects
- Test latent injection for stronger effects
- Map block sensitivities empirically

## Architecture

### Core Systems
- **Block-level injection**: Stores activation configuration in transformer_options for WanVideoWrapper to process
- **Vector arithmetic**: Mathematical operations on T5 embeddings with automatic shape alignment
- **DuckDB storage**: Persistent embedding cache with zstd compression and SQL analytics
- **Memory management**: Context managers and immediate cleanup to prevent VRAM leaks

### Data Flow
1. **Text Encoding**: WanVideoTextEncode creates raw T5 embeddings [seq_len, 4096]
2. **Vector Operations**: Optional arithmetic operations on embeddings
3. **Configuration**: WanVideoActivationEditor adds injection config to model and embeds
4. **Storage**: Embeddings cached in DuckDB with compression
5. **Sampling**: WanVideoSampler passes embeddings to transformer
6. **Processing**: Transformer processes raw embeddings through text_embedding layer
7. **Injection**: Blocks can access config via transformer_options (requires WanVideoWrapper modification)

## Key Components

## Integration Requirements
The system uses runtime patching to intercept transformer block forward() calls. No modifications to WanVideoWrapper are needed - the patching happens at runtime and has been confirmed working with the latest fixes.

## Testing

### Vector Operations Test
```python
# Test difference extraction (WAN-style prompts)
gothic = "A medieval castle standing on a foggy hillside at dusk. The structure features dark stone walls with Gothic arches and pointed towers. Gargoyles perch on the corners of the battlements, their grotesque forms silhouetted against the darkening sky. The castle walls are weathered and moss-covered, showing centuries of age. Dim orange light emanates from narrow windows, suggesting occupied chambers within. The surrounding landscape is shrouded in mist, with bare trees creating eerie shadows."

regular = "A medieval castle positioned on a grassy hillside during daytime. The fortress has sturdy stone walls with rectangular towers at each corner. The battlements are simple and functional, with crenellations for defense. The castle appears well-maintained with clean stonework. Bright sunlight illuminates the structure, creating clear shadows. The surrounding landscape shows green fields and distant forests under a clear blue sky."

style = difference(gothic, regular)

# Apply to new scene
beach = "A tropical beach scene at midday with crystal clear turquoise water. White sand stretches along the shoreline, dotted with several palm trees swaying gently in the breeze. Small waves lap against the shore, creating a rhythmic pattern. The sky is bright blue with a few wispy clouds. In the distance, a small wooden boat is anchored near the shore. The scene conveys a peaceful, vacation atmosphere."

gothic_beach = add(beach, style * 0.5)
```

### Database Verification
1. Generate several embeddings
2. Check database stats node
3. Verify compression ratios
4. Test deduplication

### Performance Monitoring
- Watch VRAM usage during operations
- Check operation timing in database
- Monitor compression effectiveness

## Injection Mode Insights

### Context Injection (Default)
- Modifies the cross-attention context that stays constant across all blocks
- Proven to work and produce visible effects when prompts differ by >50%
- Safe and stable approach

### Hidden State Injection (Experimental)
- Attempts to modify the hidden states (x) that flow through transformer blocks
- More direct intervention in the generation process
- Currently limited by dimension mismatch (T5 4096-dim vs hidden 5120-dim)
- Would require projecting T5 embeddings through initial model layers first

### Why Low Embedding Differences Occur
1. **FP8 Quantization**: Limits embedding diversity during T5 generation
2. **Similar Prompts**: T5 produces similar embeddings for semantically related text
3. **Projection Layer**: The text_embedding layer (4096→5120) destroys most differences
4. **Measurement Location**: We need to measure AFTER projection to see true context differences

### Debugging Injection Effectiveness
Use the WanVideoInjectionTester node to:
- Verify embedding differences are >50% for visible effects
- Check which dimensions differ most between prompts
- Confirm patching is active and blocks are being called

## Code Guidelines
- Always modify the main implementation directly
- Use type hints for clarity
- Include debug print statements
- Handle edge cases gracefully
- Clean up resources immediately

## Key Discovery: The Projection Bottleneck

After extensive testing, we discovered the core issue:
1. T5 embeddings can have 50%+ differences
2. The text_embedding projection layer reduces this to <1%
3. This explains why even "different" prompts produce minimal effects
4. The solution is to work around or after this projection

This fundamental insight led to creating multiple solutions that operate at different points in the pipeline to preserve or restore embedding differences.

## Complete Solution Overview

### Problem Diagnosis
- **Initial Issue**: Activation editing produced minimal visible effects
- **Root Cause**: Text embedding projection (4096→5120) destroys 99% of embedding differences
- **Evidence**: 53.6% raw embedding difference → 0.3% context difference after projection

### Solutions Implemented

#### 1. Pre-Projection Solutions
- **WanVideoEmbeddingAmplifier**: Boosts raw T5 embedding differences before projection
  - Works with existing pipeline
  - Simple and effective for most cases
  - Target 60%+ difference for visible effects

#### 2. Post-Projection Solutions  
- **WanVideoProjectionBooster**: Amplifies differences after projection damage
  - Boost factor 1-50x to restore lost differences
  - Works with projected 5120-dim embeddings
  - Preserves norm for stability

#### 3. Bypass Solutions
- **WanVideoLatentEncoder**: Captures embeddings after N transformer blocks
  - Gets true latent representations in 5120-dim space
  - Bypasses problematic projection entirely
  - Caches results for performance
  
- **WanVideoLatentInjector**: Uses latent embeddings for injection
  - Works with encoder output
  - Operates in model's native space
  - Should produce strongest effects

#### 4. Force Solutions
- **WanVideoDirectInjector**: Forces specific difference levels
  - Most aggressive approach
  - Guarantees target difference percentage
  - Three modes: additive, replace, blend

### Usage Recommendations
1. **Start Simple**: Try Embedding Amplifier first (60% target)
2. **If Subtle**: Use Projection Booster (10-20x boost)
3. **For Maximum Effect**: Use Latent Encoder + Injector combo
4. **Last Resort**: Direct Injector with high target difference

### Validation Tools
- **WanVideoInjectionTester**: Verifies embedding differences
- **WanVideoBlockActivationViewer**: Confirms injection is active
- **Debug Logging**: Set to "verbose" to see detailed metrics

## Future Roadmap
See ROADMAP.md for planned features including:
- Control vectors and direction arithmetic
- Ablation techniques for concept removal
- Rotation matrices for semantic transformations
- Multi-modal control (image/audio guided)
- Learned control vectors
