# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

```bash
pnpm run build          # compile TypeScript -> dist/ (src only)
pnpm run typecheck      # type-check src + ALL tests, no emit (tsconfig.typecheck.json)
pnpm test               # runs `typecheck` first, then unit tests, no credentials needed
pnpm run test:contract  # deterministic MCP/schema/workflow contracts
pnpm run test:protocol  # deterministic modern + legacy MCP protocol behavior
pnpm run evals          # build + eval harness; provider cases gate on RUN_LLM_EVALS=1 + provider key
pnpm run test:integration:live  # live tests, requires real B2 credentials in env
pnpm run start          # stdio transport (local Claude Desktop use)
pnpm run start:http     # Streamable HTTP transport, add --port 3000
pnpm run docs           # strict TypeDoc API reference -> gitignored api-docs/
pnpm run docs:watch     # TypeDoc watch mode with the same strict validation
```

> `pnpm run build` uses `tsconfig.json`, which **excludes `tests/`** — so it does
> not catch compile errors in test files. `pnpm run typecheck` (wired into `pnpm test`)
> compiles `src` **and** `tests` via `tsconfig.typecheck.json`, so live-test
> compile errors are caught with no credentials. This closed a real gap where a
> broken live-test reference only surfaced on a credentialed run.

Run a single unit test file:

```bash
pnpm exec vitest run --config vitest.config.mts --project=unit tests/unit/auth.unit.test.ts
```

Run a single test by name:

```bash
pnpm exec vitest run --config vitest.config.mts --project=unit --testNamePattern="should cache the token"
```

Eval harness tests:

```bash
pnpm run evals
```

The deterministic harness self-tests run without provider credentials. Provider
adapters should gate real LLM-backed eval cases on `RUN_LLM_EVALS=1` plus their
own provider key env var (for example `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`)
so normal CI remains key-free.

TypeDoc is strict. `typedoc.json` enumerates the public `src` entry-point
surface, writes generated HTML to gitignored `api-docs/`, requires module,
class, interface, function, method, property, enum, type alias, variable,
accessor, constructor, and signature documentation, and treats warnings as
errors. Undocumented public API members, undocumented modules, and invalid
links fail `pnpm run docs` and the docs workflow; issue #308 closed this
strict-validation ratchet.

Integration tests require env vars. The live suite exercises native, S3, key
management, event notifications, and the Partner API with no opt-in skips, so it
needs the full set: a non-master application key (`B2_APPLICATION_KEY_ID` /
`B2_APPLICATION_KEY`) for native, S3, and key management; the account master key
(`B2_MASTER_KEY_ID` / `B2_MASTER_KEY`) for the Partner API (which rejects
non-master keys); `B2_REGION` for the account's S3 region; and
`B2_LIVE_NOTIFICATION_BUCKET` naming a pre-provisioned, notifications-enabled
bucket:

```bash
B2_APPLICATION_KEY_ID=appkey_id B2_APPLICATION_KEY=appkey_secret \
B2_MASTER_KEY_ID=master_id B2_MASTER_KEY=master_secret \
B2_REGION=us-east-005 B2_LIVE_NOTIFICATION_BUCKET=your-notify-bucket \
pnpm run test:integration:live
```

## Commit conventions

- Commit messages are a **single line, under 72 characters**, prefixed with a
  Conventional Commit type: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`,
  `chore:`, `ci:`, `build:`, `perf:`. No body, no bullet list.
- **Never** add a `Co-Authored-By` trailer or any AI/assistant/"Generated with"
  attribution to commits or PR bodies.

## Recent behavior notes (v0.1.2)

- The outbound User-Agent product token is `b2-mcp/<version>` on a published release and `b2-mcp/dev` for source/CI/dev builds, on both the native B2 SDK and the AWS S3 SDK. The build channel is resolved in `src/version.ts` (`productVersion()` / `productToken()`, `PRODUCT_NAME`) via a publish-time `release-version.json` marker; plain `VERSION` keeps the numeric semver for the MCP handshake, `--version`, and logs. `B2_MCP_UA_SUFFIX` still appends a deployment tag. (Server self-identity and the log service name intentionally remain `backblaze-b2-mcp`.)
- S3-compatible and report tools derive their endpoint/signing region from the authorized `b2_authorize_account` `s3ApiUrl`; `B2_REGION` is only a fallback/default before authorization or when authorize is temporarily unavailable.
- The native analytics tools and `b2_list_buckets` resolve a bucket-scoped key through its authorized `allowedBuckets` scope instead of an unfiltered `listBuckets()` (which a bucket-scoped key cannot call), and reject/report out-of-scope input without enumerating the key's bucket namespace.
- Destructive-gate refusals are stable, non-500 tool outcomes: `destructive_policy_blocked` (HTTP 403), and `destructive_confirmation_required` / `destructive_confirmation_refused` (HTTP 409); `tool.call` audit logs record those codes/statuses, not `internal_error`/500.
- Local `TimeoutError` and `AbortError` values normalize to `request_timeout` (HTTP 504) and `request_aborted` (HTTP 499) instead of `internal_error`/500. Interrupted no-replay native/Partner writes such as `b2_create_bucket`, `b2_create_key`, and Partner account creation surface as `operation_status_unknown` (HTTP 409) with verify-before-retry guidance; because that reader is installed only after a 2xx response, *any* body-read failure there (including a plain `SyntaxError` from a truncated or malformed body, not just timeout/abort/socket-reset interruptions) is treated as unknown-status. These ambiguous write outcomes also emit a distinct warn-level `native.write.outcome_unknown` log event. Timeout and socket-loss ambiguity counts toward circuit-breaker failure accounting, but ambiguity whose originating cause is a caller abort (an in-flight no-replay cancellation) stays filtered so client disconnects cannot open the shared circuit.
- Test layers beyond unit/contract/protocol: `reliability` (dependency failure/recovery), `runtime-security` (HTTP fault injection), `observability` (logging behavior), `package` (packed install + repack reproducibility), plus the advisory `perf:baseline`. Run a layer with `pnpm run test:<layer>`.

## Architecture

### Entry points

- `src/index.ts` — stdio transport (Claude Desktop, local use)
- `src/http-server.ts` — **Streamable HTTP** transport for hosted deployments. Production serving uses the MCP SDK v2 per-request handler for MCP `2026-07-28` and a stateless 2025-era transition fallback; it does not create or depend on protocol sessions. Each `/mcp` request resolves credentials through the selected provider (`headers`, `server`, or `principal`) before the SDK handler runs. B2 credential and Authorization headers are stripped before crossing into the SDK boundary; verified caller identity travels only as `authInfo`. Handles `GET /health`, Host/Origin checks, request body caps, rate limiting, in-flight caps, graceful drain, and periodic cache sweeps.

### Tool registration flow

`server.ts` exports three functions:

- `loadConfig()` — reads env vars, validates required keys, returns `B2Config`
- `fetchCapabilities(config)` — one-shot authorize that returns the key's `allowed.capabilities`; returns `null` only for `B2_REGISTER_ALL_TOOLS=true`. Lookup failures throw so HTTP fails closed.
- `createServer(config, capabilities?)` — instantiates `B2AuthManager`, the SDK-backed `B2Client`, and the AWS S3 data-plane client (configured through `@backblaze-labs/b2-sdk/s3`), then calls all `register*Tools()` functions and, when `B2_ENABLE_MCP_PROMPTS=true`, `registerB2WorkflowPrompts()`

Each register function receives the server + client(s) and calls `server.tool(name, description, zodSchema, handler)` for each tool. Adding a new tool means adding it to the appropriate register file — no changes to `server.ts` needed unless it's a new register file. **New tools should also be added to the capability map** (`src/utils/tool-capabilities.ts`).

**Capability-aware registration.** When `createServer` is given a `capabilities` array (the entry points fetch it via `fetchCapabilities`), it wraps `server.tool` so only tools the key can use are registered — the surface auto-right-sizes to the credential (a read-only key drops every write/delete/admin tool; full ~9,719 tokens → read-only ~2,867). The map is `src/utils/tool-capabilities.ts` (any-of semantics; unmapped tools always register; Partner tools register only with a distinct master key). When `capabilities` is `null`/omitted — all unit tests, or `B2_REGISTER_ALL_TOOLS=true` — the full surface registers, so there's no behavior change. The key decides what's _possible_; the destructive gate decides what's _permitted_.

### Resource registration flow

`src/resources.ts` registers the read-only MCP resource surface after tools are
committed, so `b2://capabilities` can report the active tool profile. Resources
are JSON only:

- `b2://server-config` - non-secret process configuration: transport,
  credential mode, destructive policy, secret-sink mode, public URL, and server
  version. It is intentionally not B2-capability-gated because it contains no
  account identifiers or credential values and supports credential-less stdio
  discovery.
- `b2://capabilities` - the current credential capability set plus active tool
  profile; omitted in credential-less discovery mode and reduced by OAuth scope
  policy when OAuth is active.
- `b2://bucket/{bucketName}` - capability/OAuth-gated on the same central
  `isToolEnabled` / `isToolAllowedByOAuthScopes` policy as `b2_list_buckets`.
  `resources/list` advertises at most the first 100 concrete bucket resources
  because B2 has no bucket-list pagination; `resources/read` can still target a
  known bucket name directly. Bucket reads include type/visibility, lifecycle,
  Object Lock, retention, encryption, CORS, replication, and notification rules
  when the caller is also allowed to use `b2_get_bucket_notification_rules`.

Bucket notification rules use the same redaction helper as the bucket tools.
Webhook URL host/path/query, HMAC signing secrets, and custom-header values are
redacted before reaching the MCP response, and successful resource payloads pass
through the central MCP-output sanitizer. Bucket resource reads are not given a
client cache hint because visibility and notification targets are
security-relevant after writes.

### Prompt registration flow

MCP workflow prompts are off by default; set `B2_ENABLE_MCP_PROMPTS=true` to enable them once every replica runs prompt-capable code. The flag gates both handler registration and `prompts/list` advertisement together, so it is not a decoupled two-phase rollout: flip it atomically across the fleet (or use sticky routing) so no replica advertises `prompts/list` while a sibling replica still lacks a `prompts/get` handler. Prompt definitions live in `src/prompts.ts` and register through `PromptRegistrationAdapter`, which shares the deferred registration machinery used by `ToolRegistrationAdapter`. Prompt availability is derived from the committed tool registry: every `requiredTools` entry must be a registered, available (non-stub) handler, and any `requiredCapabilities` entry must be present in the resolved B2 capability set. This keeps prompts aligned with durable-secret sink stubs, OAuth/transport gates, and future tool-registration policy.

Prompts return structured message templates only; they never execute B2 tools. Destructive or credential-producing steps still happen later through `tools/call`, so the existing destructive gate and MCP elicitation remain authoritative. Four workflow prompts intentionally launch the shipped companion skills (`b2-object-lock`, `b2-incident-response`, `b2-lifecycle-cost-hygiene`, `b2-least-privilege-keys`) instead of restating those playbooks; `b2_review_bucket_notifications` is the net-new prompt workflow.

### Three backing categories, two client types

The public tool surface is described by backing category, with availability
recorded per tool instead of as a separate bucket:

- **Native B2 SDK** (`@backblaze-labs/b2-sdk`) — B2 control-plane operations the S3 API has no equivalent for, including buckets, application keys, Object Lock, event notifications, and Partner/Groups operations.
- **AWS S3 SDK** (`@aws-sdk/client-s3`) — the S3-compatible data plane behind every `s3_*` tool.
- **Neither SDK** — repository-owned MCP analytics (`b2_report_usage_growth`, `b2_rank_egress_leaders`, `b2_list_largest_files`, `b2_unfinished_uploads`) built from B2 reports and bounded live listings because no SDK exposes those aggregates as primitives.

Durable-secret-producing tools stay in the Native B2 SDK category even when
their current availability is a non-secret compatibility stub.

**B2 SDK boundary** (`src/b2/`) — the official `@backblaze-labs/b2-sdk` integration boundary for B2 authorization state, endpoint data, retry semantics, and native bucket/key/Object Lock/notification/Partner operations. `B2Client` owns the shared auth/circuit wrapper and native lookups used by S3 safety guards, such as version-ID ownership checks and delete-marker metadata synthesis.

**S3-compatible API** (`src/s3/`) — the **data-plane tool contract**: all `s3_*` object, presigned URL, multipart, bucket reachability/location/lifecycle, upload-part-copy, and report-bucket reads use the permanent AWS S3 SDK peer client configured through `@backblaze-labs/b2-sdk/s3`. B2 rejects **master** keys on the S3 endpoint, but ordinary application keys are accepted — which is why a non-master application key (`B2_APPLICATION_KEY_ID` / `B2_APPLICATION_KEY`) is the primary credential and signs S3 requests. (The former `B2_APP_KEY_ID` / `B2_APP_KEY` separate-S3-key override has been removed.)

**Credential routing** (`createServer` in `server.ts`): the application key drives the B2 native API, S3, and key management. Only the Partner API tools use the master key — `createServer` builds a second `B2Client` from `B2_MASTER_KEY_*` and wires it into `registerPartnerTools`, falling back to the application-key client when no distinct master key is set.

### Auth token lifecycle (`src/auth.ts`)

`B2AuthManager` caches the token for 23 hours (B2 tokens are valid 24h). Concurrent `getAuth()` calls share a single in-flight authorize request (deduped via `inflightAuth` promise). On 401, `B2Client` calls `auth.invalidate()` before retrying so the next `getAuth()` re-authorizes.

### Object upload / data plane

Object data movement runs through the **`s3_*` data-plane tools**. Inline object operations in `src/s3/objects.ts`, presigning in `src/s3/presigned.ts`, and multipart in `src/s3/multipart.ts` all call the repository-owned AWS S3 peer adapter configured for B2's S3-compatible endpoint.

**Control-plane-first data path.** The preferred way to move real object data is a **presigned URL** (`s3_get_presigned_url`, PutObject or GetObject): the bytes flow directly between the client/worker and B2 and never pass through the server. The inline `s3_put_object` / `s3_get_object` paths are bounded to **≤ 1 MiB** (`MAX_INLINE_OBJECT_BYTES` in `src/s3/objects.ts`) — a control-plane convenience for manifests, sidecars, and tiny configs; anything larger is refused with a pointer to `s3_get_presigned_url` or the multipart flow. **Multipart is presigned-per-part too**: `s3_create_multipart_upload` → `s3_get_presigned_upload_part_url` (mints a presigned PUT URL per part) → the client PUTs each part directly to B2 → `s3_complete_multipart_upload` with the returned ETags. No multipart tool streams part bytes through the server. On the trusted stdio transport, `saveToPath` still streams any size straight to disk without buffering. Because the HTTP transport also disables local-file access by default, the internet-facing server is **control-plane-only by construction**: no bulk object data can flow through it.

> The former native data tools and their files (`src/b2/files.ts`, `src/b2/large-files.ts`, `src/b2/download-urls.ts` — including `b2_upload_file`'s auto-multipart path and the native download-URL builders) were **removed** from the public tool surface. The inherited `s3_*` object names remain compatibility aliases, and their implementation now uses the AWS S3 SDK against B2's S3-compatible endpoint.

### Tool naming conventions

- **Prefix:** `b2_*` — B2-native names. Most are Native B2 SDK control-plane tools; the four analytics names are the custom MCP category. `s3_*` — compatibility data-plane names; object aliases, presigned URLs, multipart, reachability, and lifecycle paths use the AWS SDK peer client through the SDK `/s3` boundary.
- **Shape:** `<prefix>_<verb>_<noun>`, snake_case, lowercase, **verb-first**. Use a standard verb (`list`, `get`, `create`, `update`, `delete`, `put`, `rank`, `report`, …), matching the upstream B2/S3 operation where one exists. No noun-only names (e.g. `b2_largest_files` was renamed to `b2_list_largest_files`). Presign tools use the `s3_get_presigned_*_url` form (verb = `get`), never a bare `s3_presign_*` form. `b2_unfinished_uploads` is a known grandfathered noun-only exception (see the contract doc); don't copy it.
- The authoritative rule, the verb list, and the required lockstep-update checklist live in [`docs/design-docs/tool-contract.md`](docs/design-docs/tool-contract.md#tool-naming-conventions) — consult it before adding or renaming a tool.

### Retry logic (`src/utils/retry.ts`)

The official SDK retry transport handles B2 retries and token refresh. `B2Client.withNativeCircuit()` wraps native/SDK B2 operations in the shared circuit breaker; local S3 presigning is intentionally outside that breaker unless it must perform a fresh native lookup such as version-ID ownership validation.

### Test patterns

Unit tests (`tests/unit/`) mock dependencies with `vi.spyOn(...)` — no network
calls, no credentials needed. `tests/contract/tools-schema.contract.test.ts`
builds the full server with dummy credentials and validates all 40 tool schemas
structurally.

Live integration tests (`tests/live/b2.integration.live.test.ts` and
`tests/live/request-shape.contract.live.test.ts`) run against real B2 and gate
on credentials, with no opt-in escape hatches:

- `liveIt` runs a case only when `B2_APPLICATION_KEY_ID` / `B2_APPLICATION_KEY`
  are present, and skips otherwise. Every live case uses this guard.
- The Partner read paths (`b2_list_groups`, `b2_list_group_members`) require the
  account master key (`B2_MASTER_KEY_ID` / `B2_MASTER_KEY`) on a Partner-entitled
  account; they assert real results and fail (never skip) when it is missing.
  There is no `B2_PARTNER_LIVE` flag.
- The event-notification write-shape contract requires
  `B2_LIVE_NOTIFICATION_BUCKET` to name a pre-provisioned, notifications-enabled
  bucket, with the key holding `writeBucketNotifications`. It sets then clears
  rules and never deletes the bucket.

There is no `create_group_member`/`eject` mutating test in the live suite;
`b2_create_group_member` would create a real, non-deletable account and must
never run in CI.

## HTTP transport: per-request credentials & hardening

The HTTP server (`src/http-server.ts`) implements a single `/mcp` endpoint with MCP `2026-07-28` as the preferred era and stateless 2025-era compatibility during migration. Credentials are resolved per request. Unset `B2_HTTP_CREDENTIAL_MODE` defaults to `headers` for one-release compatibility; hosted operators should set `server` or `principal` explicitly when clients must not send B2 keys.

Because this transport is internet-facing, it is hardened by default:

- **Local filesystem access is OFF.** `filePath` / `saveToPath` are rejected unless an operator sets `B2_ALLOW_LOCAL_FILES=true` **and** `B2_FILE_ROOT=/sandbox/dir` — and even then every path is confined (symlinks resolved) to that root via `src/utils/fs-guard.ts`. Remote callers can pass small (≤ 1 MiB) base64 `content` inline; for real object data they should use a presigned PutObject URL (`s3_get_presigned_url`) so bytes go client→B2 directly. On the stdio transport disk access is on by default (trusted local user); set `B2_FILE_ROOT` to sandbox it or `B2_ALLOW_LOCAL_FILES=false` to disable.
- **In-flight caps:** `B2_MAX_SESSIONS` (default 1000) total and `B2_MAX_SESSIONS_PER_KEY` (default 20) per credential, returning 503 / 429 over the cap. The env names are retained for deploy-manifest compatibility.
- **Rate limiting** keys on a SHA-256 hash of the full key id (not a prefix), so distinct tenants can't collide.
- **DNS-rebinding protection:** set `B2_ALLOWED_HOSTS` / `B2_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` (comma-separated) to enable Host/Origin validation on the `/mcp` endpoint.
- **Body cap:** POST bodies to `/mcp` are capped at 1 MB (413 over the cap).
- **`b2_create_key` lockdown** (`src/b2/keys.ts`, applies on all transports): a minted key is a durable credential the model sees once, so by default the server **rejects** minting keys that grant key-management capabilities (`listKeys`/`writeKeys`/`deleteKeys` — a self-perpetuating backdoor) and **rejects** unscoped keys holding write/delete capabilities (forces a `bucketId`/`bucketIds` scope). Optional `B2_MAX_KEY_DURATION_SECONDS` enforces a maximum validity and forbids non-expiring keys. Overrides: `B2_ALLOW_KEY_MGMT_GRANTS=true`, `B2_ALLOW_UNSCOPED_KEYS=true`. B2 still independently enforces that a key cannot exceed the creating key's own capabilities.
- **Destructive-operation gate** (`src/utils/destructive-gate.ts`, all transports). Irreversible/high-impact tools are gated by `B2_DESTRUCTIVE_POLICY`. **Coverage (15 tools):** explicit deletes (`s3_delete_object`, `s3_delete_objects`, `s3_abort_multipart_upload`, `b2_delete_bucket`, `b2_delete_key`); durable key creation (`b2_create_key`); PutObject presigning (`s3_get_presigned_url` with `operation: "PutObject"`); `b2_eject_group_member`; irreversible/billable account creation (`b2_create_group_member`, `b2_reserve_trial_create_account`); persistent webhook replacement (`b2_set_bucket_notification_rules`); the protection-removal steps that precede a delete (`b2_update_file_retention` when clearing retention or using `bypassGovernance`, `b2_update_file_legal_hold` when set to `off`, `b2_update_bucket` when it makes a bucket public, disables/clears Object Lock, schedules deletion via `lifecycleRules`, or sets replication rules); and `s3_put_bucket_lifecycle` when a rule schedules deletion/expiration. **Policies:** `confirm` requires MCP form elicitation approval on compatible 2026 clients, or `confirm: true` when elicitation is unavailable/disabled; `elicit` requires human MCP form elicitation approval and refuses (`destructive_confirmation_refused`/409) when the client cannot prompt a human or elicitation is disabled — a model-supplied `confirm: true` does not satisfy it ("require a human, and refuse if you can't reach one"); `block` refuses outright before elicitation; `allow` disables the gate and skips elicitation. **Per-transport default: stdio = `confirm` (trusted local user); the internet-facing HTTP transport = `block` (safe-by-default).** An operator opts down with `B2_DESTRUCTIVE_POLICY`. Server-side, so it holds even for MCP clients without the skills layer; each gated tool exposes an optional `confirm` boolean. `confirm` and client-relayed elicitation are defense-in-depth (a hijacked or malicious client could fabricate approval) — `block` (the HTTP default) or host consent is the wall for untrusted contexts.

Client config notes:

- **Claude Desktop** (`claude_desktop_config.json`) only accepts stdio entries. To connect to a hosted Streamable HTTP server, use the `mcp-remote` bridge as a local stdio shim (`command: "npx"`, `args: ["-y", "mcp-remote", "<url>/mcp", "--header", "X-B2-MCP-Key-Id:…", "--header", "X-B2-MCP-Key:…"]`). The URL + headers shape is rejected by Claude Desktop with "not a valid MCP server configuration."
- **Claude.ai web / Pro / Max Custom Connectors** accept the URL + headers shape directly: `{ url, headers: { "X-B2-MCP-Key-Id": "…", "X-B2-MCP-Key": "…" } }`.

`X-B2-MCP-Key-Id` / `X-B2-MCP-Key` are required — the application key, used for B2 native, S3, and key management. `X-B2-MCP-Master-Key-Id` / `X-B2-MCP-Master-Key` are optional and used **only** by the Partner API tools (they fall back to the application key when absent). Use a non-master application key: B2 rejects master keys on the S3 endpoint, and the short `X-B2-*` aliases plus the `X-B2-App-Key-*` S3 override have been removed.

## Deployment target

t4g.medium (2 vCPU, 4 GB RAM) on AWS, us-west-2. Fly.io or Railway are simpler alternatives (automatic SSL, no nginx needed). EC2 requires nginx for SSL termination (Let's Encrypt + Certbot) and a systemd service to keep the process running.
