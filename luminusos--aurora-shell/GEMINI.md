# AGENTS instructions

## Git Policy

**Never create commits, pull requests, or push to any remote.** Do not run `git commit`, `git push`, `git pr`, or any equivalent. Leave all git operations to the user.

## Validation After Changes

After a change to code under `src/`, always follow these rules to ensure quality while being efficient. For documentation, workflow, metadata, translation, or other non-`src/` changes, do not run `just validate` or `just shexli` unless the task specifically requires that validation.

1.  **Run `just validate`** — type-checks the source, lints, and checks formatting. Fix any reported errors.
2.  **Run `just shexli`** — packages the extension and runs the extensions.gnome.org static analyzer on the generated ZIP. Review every finding. Some `warning` or `manual_review` findings can be false positives or accepted GNOME-review tradeoffs, but they must be called out explicitly; fix any real regression before finishing.
3.  **Run targeted integration tests:**
    - If you modified only **one module**, run only its Shell test (e.g., `just test shell tests/shell/desktop/trayIcons`).
    - If you made **formatting-only changes** (Prettier) and have already passed the tests in a previous turn, you only need to run `just validate` and `just shexli`.
    - If you made **architectural or cross-cutting changes**, run `just toolbox test`.

**IMPORTANT:** Never execute `just test shell` or `just toolbox test` chained with another command using `&&`. Always run tests as a separate standalone turn.

To read only the relevant output from a full test run (pass/fail summary):

```sh
just toolbox test 2>&1 | grep -E "PASS:|FAIL:|Results:"
```

Do not leave a task incomplete if either command reports errors or failures.

## Commands

- **Install deps:** `just deps` — runs `yarn install --immutable`; use once or after changing branches
- **Build:** `just build` — compiles TypeScript and SCSS, copies metadata/schemas, and compiles `.mo` files
- **Package:** `just package production` — packs the production extension as a `.zip` in `dist/target/`
- **Development package:** `just package development` — packs the separate DevTool-enabled development ZIP
- **Inspect packages:** `just package check` — builds both ZIPs and verifies their contents and generated line lengths
- **Install:** `just install` — packages and installs the DevTool-enabled development ZIP
- **Uninstall:** `just uninstall` — disables and removes the extension
- **Run (host):** `just run` — installs development, then launches a DevTool-enabled devkit session
- **Run (toolbox):** `just toolbox run` — packages/installs on the host, then runs GNOME Shell inside the Fedora toolbox
- **Create toolbox:** `just toolbox create` — creates `aurora-shell-devel` from the same Fedora/GNOME image used by CI
- **Remove toolbox:** `just toolbox remove` — delete the toolbox
- **Validate:** `just validate` — runs tsc, ESLint, Prettier check, and Stylelint
- **Shexli:** `just shexli` — packages the extension and runs the extensions.gnome.org static analyzer on the generated ZIP
- **Lint:** `just lint` — runs ESLint only
- **Watch SCSS:** `just watch` — watches `src/styles/` and recompiles on change
- **View logs:** `just logs` — shows recent `aurora` entries from the current boot journal
- **Clean:** `just clean` — removes `dist/`
- **Deep clean:** `just clean all` — removes `dist/` and `node_modules/`

- **Shell tests:** `just test shell [file-or-directory]` — packages and runs all Shell tests, or a recursive target, on the host
- **DevTool Shell test:** `just test dev` — tests `tests/shell/dev/devTool.test.js` against the development ZIP
- **Shell tests (toolbox):** `just toolbox test [file-or-directory]` — preferred full or targeted execution inside the Fedora toolbox
- **DevTool Shell test (toolbox):** `just toolbox test-dev` — runs the development test inside the toolbox
- **Vagrant VM:** `just vagrant create|run|ssh|remove` — full Arch VM kept for manual GNOME environment testing

### i18n commands

- **Regenerate POT template:** `just i18n pot` — builds, then scans compiled JS (`dist/`) and writes the `.pot` into `dist/` (a build artifact, **not** committed — avoids `POT-Creation-Date` churn). Run this whenever translatable strings are added or removed.
- **Merge new strings into .po files:** `just i18n update` — depends on `i18n pot`; regenerates the template into `dist/` then runs `msgmerge` on every `data/po/*.po` against it. The hand-translated `data/po/*.po` files are the committed source of truth.
- **Compile .mo binaries:** `just i18n compile` — compiles each `po/*.po` into `dist/locale/<lang>/LC_MESSAGES/*.mo`. Called automatically by `just build`.

## Repository Structure

- `src/` — TypeScript source root
  - `extension.ts` — minimal production entry point
  - `extension.dev.ts` — development entry point used only by the development ZIP
  - `core/extensionBase.ts` — shared extension lifecycle; creates the context and delegates to `ModuleManager`
  - `module.ts` — base `Module` plus manifest, option, factory, and runtime policy types
  - `moduleCatalog.ts` — ordered Shell-free manifest catalog shared by runtime and preferences
  - `moduleManager.ts` — settings/runtime reconciliation, failure isolation, and teardown
  - `registry.ts` — associates every catalog manifest with its runtime factory
  - `prefs.ts` — generic preferences UI driven directly by `moduleCatalog.ts`
  - `core/` — small shared context, cleanup, logging, and settings utilities
    - `context.ts` — `ExtensionContext` interface and implementation
    - `logger.ts` — Abstracted logging
    - `settings.ts` — `SettingsManager` abstraction for GSettings
  - feature modules are grouped by semantic area instead of a single `modules/` root:
    - `dock/` — dock module and dock-specific helpers
    - `panel/` — GNOME panel and Quick Settings integrations
    - `desktop/` — desktop-only modules such as tray icons
    - `patches/` — focused Shell behavior patches and monkey-patches
    - `theme/` — theme and color-scheme modules
    - `privacy/` — privacy and screen-sharing behavior
    - `clipboard/` — clipboard history module and UI
  - `device/` — runtime target and hardware capability detection for future mobile work
  - `dev/` — developer-only tooling (e.g., `devTool.ts`), gated behind the `AURORA_DEVTOOLS=1` env var and excluded from the production ZIP. **Not** a feature module: it is not in the registry, prefs, or gschema
  - `shared/` — shared utilities used across modules (e.g., `quickSettings.ts`)
  - `styles/` — SCSS stylesheets (compiled to light + dark CSS)
  - `types/` — TypeScript type declarations (`@girs`, GJS, etc.)
- `data/` — resources files
  - `schemas/` — GSettings schema XML
  - `icons/` — SVG icons used in the project
  - `po/` — translation files
- `tests/` — automated tests
  - `unit/` — recursively discovered `*.test.ts` tests, organized by the same domains as `src/`; for pure logic that does not import Shell internals
  - `shell/` — recursively discovered `*.test.js` scripts organized by domain; exercise modules in a real headless GNOME Shell
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — CI pipeline (lint + type-check → unit tests + build → integration tests)
- `Containerfile` — shared Fedora/GNOME build and integration-test environment used by CI and Toolbox
- `scripts/` — focused helpers for GNOME Shell tests, Toolbox devkit, and Vagrant devkit
- `esbuild.ts` — esbuild bundler configuration
- `sass.config.ts` — Sass compiler configuration
- `justfile` — all project commands
- `metadata.json` — GNOME extension metadata (uuid, version, shell versions)
- `dist/` — build output (gitignored)

## Architecture

1. **Settings via context:** Modules receive an `ExtensionContext` in their constructor and read configuration through `this.context.settings` (the `SettingsManager` abstraction) rather than touching `Gio.Settings` directly.
2. **`Main` is fair game:** Importing `Main` (`resource:///org/gnome/shell/ui/main.js`) directly follows the [GJS module guidance](https://gjs.guide/extensions/overview/imports-and-modules.html) and is expected — there is no shell adapter. Confidence in shell interactions comes from the `tests/shell/` integration suite running a real headless GNOME Shell, not from mocking `Main`.
3. **Layering & testability:** Keep UI logic (Clutter/St) separated from pure domain logic. Extract complex algorithms into pure TypeScript files with no shell imports (e.g., `src/dock/monitorTopology.ts`, `src/desktop/trayIcons/trayState.ts`) so they can be unit-tested with `node --test`. UI/shell glue is covered by integration tests instead, following the same whole-Shell approach described by [GNOME Shell's automated testing notes](https://blogs.gnome.org/shell-dev/2022/12/02/automated-testing-of-gnome-shell/).
4. **Metadata-Driven UI:** Each feature owns a Shell-free `*.manifest.ts`. `moduleCatalog.ts` is the single ordered metadata source consumed by preferences and runtime.
5. **Factories:** Runtime implementations export their classes. `registry.ts` is the explicit association between catalog keys and factories; implementation files contain no preference metadata.

## Adding a Module

1. Create a Shell-free `*.manifest.ts` beside the implementation:

```typescript
import { gettext as _ } from 'gettext';
import type { ModuleManifest } from '~/module.ts';

export const manifest: ModuleManifest = {
  key: 'my-module',
  settingsKey: 'module-my-module',
  section: 'behavior',
  title: _('My Module'),
  subtitle: _('Description'),
  runtime: { roles: ['desktop'], scope: 'session' },
  options: [{ key: 'my-option', title: _('Option'), subtitle: _('Desc'), type: 'switch' }],
};
```

2. Export the `Module` implementation class from its behavior file. Keep preference metadata out of that implementation.
3. Add the manifest to `moduleCatalog.ts` in display order and associate its class factory in `registry.ts`.
4. Add every declared module, option, and internal setting key to the GSettings schema.
5. Add unit and Shell integration coverage as appropriate.

`registry.test.ts` checks the catalog/factory relationship through the TypeScript AST. `schema.test.ts` structurally validates that every catalog setting is present in the XML and that no stale schema setting remains.

### Prefs sections

The prefs window groups modules by `section`. The ordered section list lives in `getSections()` in `src/moduleCatalog.ts`:

```typescript
export function getSections(): ModuleSection[] {
  return [
    { id: 'dock-panel', title: _('Dock & Panel') },
    // …
  ];
}
```

To add a new section, append a `{ id, title }` entry here (the array order is the on-screen group order), then reference its `id` from a module's `section`. A module whose `section` matches no known id falls into a defensive "Other" group at the bottom.

### Clipboard shortcuts

Per the GNOME review guidelines, clipboard-related keyboard shortcuts must not ship with a default. The Clipboard History `clipboard-history-shortcut` key defaults to `[]`; users assign it via the `type: 'shortcut'` row in prefs. Keep any future clipboard shortcuts unset by default.

## Coding Standards

- File names: `camelCase.ts`
- Classes: `PascalCase`
- Private members: `_prefixed`
- Constants: `UPPER_CASE`
- Keep `enable()` and `disable()` symmetric.
- Read settings through `this.context.settings`. Importing `Main`/`Shell`/`St` directly is fine — keep heavy algorithms in shell-free pure files so they stay unit-testable.
- Optimize refactors for human readability, not line count. Do not compress control flow, callback bodies, object literals, or several operations onto one line merely to shorten a file.
- Visually separate guard clauses, state preparation, actor mutation, animation, scheduling, and cleanup with blank lines. Keep local constants next to the logical block that consumes them; avoid unexplained aliases in the middle of a stateful method.
- Do not add pass-through methods that only forward the same arguments to a stored function or object. Expose a meaningful domain operation, return the required callable directly, or keep the call at its natural owner.
- Do not add production getters, comments, or other API surface solely to expose private state to tests. Keep repeated integration-test lookup and assertion logic in `tests/shell/support/`, and exercise the runtime through an existing meaningful boundary.
- Comments must explain a non-obvious reason, constraint, or contract. Remove comments that merely restate a symbol name, type annotation, or the operations visible in the code.
- Do not hide lifecycle invariants behind optional chaining with fallback values, such as `owner?.value ?? default` or `owner?.operation() ?? false`. At public boundaries, guard the inactive state explicitly and access stable fields directly during synchronous work. Reserve optional property access for genuinely optional external data; make cleanup decisions explicit.
- Do not create a local alias for an instance field merely to shorten `this._field`, repeat the same name, or satisfy nullable type narrowing during synchronous work. Guard the field explicitly and use it directly when it cannot change inside the block. A snapshot of an instance field is justified only when it transfers ownership before the field is cleared or captures the exact resource across an `await` or asynchronous callback. A local result is also appropriate for a genuinely dynamic lookup or computation that must remain stable; directly reading `this._field` is not such a lookup. Name identity captures explicitly, such as `scheduledRetry` or `activeRequest`, so the reason is visible.
- Before finishing a refactor, review every newly created or substantially edited file as prose: expand dense one-line branches and loops, remove redundant wrappers, and make lifecycle ownership obvious without requiring the reader to infer it from implementation details.

## Human Review Quality Bar

Avoid code that only looks plausible. A human reviewer should be able to read a change and see a real contract, not a guess.

When reporting a review, prioritize code and concrete findings. Keep explanations short and list removed noise or simplifications as concise bullets; do not produce long change summaries.

### EGO review policy

Changes intended for the production extension must follow both:

- [GNOME Extensions review guidelines](https://gjs.guide/extensions/review-guidelines/review-guidelines.html)
- [EGO AI reference](https://blogs.gnome.org/jrahmatzadeh/2026/07/27/ego-ai-reference/)

Apply these rules during implementation and review:

- Target only the Shell versions declared in `metadata.json`. Do not add speculative compatibility branches, `typeof method === 'function'` checks, or optional calls for methods guaranteed by those versions. For real multi-version support, follow the [official port guide](https://gjs.guide/extensions/upgrading/gnome-shell.html).
- Do not wrap deterministic lifecycle methods such as `destroy()`, `connect()`, `disconnect()`, `disconnectObject()`, `abort()`, `GLib.Source.remove()`, or `Gio.DBusConnection.unregister_object()` in defensive `try`/`catch`. Catch failures only at operations whose contract can genuinely fail, such as I/O, parsing, D-Bus calls, subprocesses, and asynchronous result propagation.
- Never invoke a callable value with direct optional-call syntax. It hides why the callback may be absent. Call guaranteed functions directly and use an explicit boundary guard when a callable value is legitimately optional.
- Do not add `_enabled`, `_destroyed`, or similar lifecycle flags when owned references, cancellables, or the underlying GObject lifecycle already express the state. After destruction, the owner must clear its reference and must not call the instance again.
- In widget `destroy()` overrides, remove GLib sources and timeouts first, disconnect signals next, release owned children and references after that, and call `super.destroy()` last. A widget must override its own `destroy()` method instead of connecting its own `destroy` signal for cleanup; observing the destruction of an external actor is valid when the observer owns that connection.
- Every signal, GLib source, cancellable, child actor, menu, Soup session, and other resource created by a component must be cleaned up by that same component. Never spread initialization and cleanup ownership across unrelated classes.
- When a repeatable operation creates a timeout, remove or replace its prior source immediately next to the new source creation. Do not separate replacement and creation into distant methods or blocks.
- Keep `extension.ts` minimal. Keep `enable()` and `disable()` adjacent, symmetric, and limited to lifecycle orchestration; avoid aliases that merely forward lifecycle calls. Never ship empty, placeholder, or partially implemented lifecycle methods.
- Split large features into cohesive, single-responsibility modules. Extract repeated logic into helpers instead of copying blocks. Modules imported by both Shell and preferences must remain free of `St`, `Clutter`, `Gtk`, `Gdk`, and `Adw`; keep process-specific UI under clearly named runtime or `preferences/` directories.
- Keep the extension's schema ID in `metadata.json` as `settings-schema` and call `this.getSettings()` without repeating the schema ID in source code.
- Use `St.Icon` or `icon_name` for Shell UI and `Gtk.Image` for preferences. Do not use Unicode emoji as icons or ASCII strings as progress indicators; use Shell widgets such as `BarLevel` or `St.Bin`.
- Keep generated JavaScript lines at 200 characters or fewer. Prefer self-explanatory names and remove comments that restate syntax or translate the following statement into prose.
- Avoid subprocesses in the Shell process. Prefer D-Bus for system services and move heavy work to a separate application. If a subprocess is unavoidable, document why D-Bus is not practical and keep invocation local, explicit, cancellable, and free of shell interpretation.
- Review every Shexli finding. Fix real ownership/lifecycle defects and record accepted manual-review findings or analyzer false positives in `docs/extension-review.md`.

- Never invoke `disconnectObject` defensively on objects that do not own that signal connection contract.
- Do not ship fake behavior. If a UI label, schema description, README entry, or module subtitle says a feature is wired to NetworkManager, ModemManager, UPower, sensors, widgets, or GNOME internals, the code must actually call the relevant API or clearly describe itself as a fallback.
- Keep runtime capability checks honest. Hardware-specific modules must detect missing services/devices at runtime and stay inactive or degrade explicitly.
- Capture the return of `GObject.registerClass` and derive its instance type with `InstanceType<typeof RegisteredClass>` when a registered class accepts custom constructor arguments. Do not add decorators or generic construction/casting helpers around GObject classes.
- Do not scatter `as unknown as ...` casts through feature modules. Represent real GIR or GNOME Shell declaration gaps with narrow module augmentations under `src/types/`; when TypeScript cannot augment a static constructor, isolate that constructor signature at its single call site.
- Avoid the nullish coalescing operators `??` and `??=`. Prefer explicit guards, default parameters, destructuring defaults, or clearly named state preparation so reviewers can see why a value may be absent and when a fallback applies. Preserve the absence value returned by the source API unless a boundary contract explicitly requires normalization.
- Do not leave placeholder helpers, legacy duplicates, or unused compatibility functions after a refactor. Remove dead code instead of keeping it “just in case”.
- Keep strings and metadata truthful and synchronized across `*.manifest.ts`, `moduleCatalog.ts`, schema XML, README/architecture docs, and `.po` files when strings change.
- Search for obvious generated-code artifacts before finishing: broken joined words in docs, stale project names, obsolete env vars, and UI descriptions that exceed what is implemented.
- Prefer explicit D-Bus/property handling over no-op calls that only log success. If a feature cannot be safely implemented yet, make the limitation visible in the title/subtitle/docs rather than implying it works.

### Clean code and AI slop

- Avoid generic helpers and speculative abstractions. Names must express domain behavior: `handleMonitorsChanged` is fine because it names the event, `handleEvent` or `processData` are not. Preserve established terms such as `ModuleManager` when they describe real ownership.
- Keep important lifecycle behavior visible at concrete entrypoints. Do not leave an entrypoint empty merely to hide its primary `enable()`/`disable()` orchestration behind inheritance.

## Logging Style

Prefix every log message with the module name in `[PascalCase]` brackets. Use the global `logger` from `~/core/logger.ts` — never `console.log/warn` or `GLib.log_structured` directly from module code.

```typescript
import { logger } from '~/core/logger.ts';

// Correct
logger.log('[AuroraTray] Item added: ' + id);

// Wrong
logger.log('[Aurora Shell] [aurora-tray] Item added: ' + id);
console.warn('[aurora-shell] Something failed');
```

The `[Aurora Shell]` prefix is redundant — SYSLOG_IDENTIFIER already routes journal output to the extension.

## Reading GNOME Shell Source

GNOME Shell JS source is embedded in `libshell-XX.so` as a GResource archive. The stylesheet files is `gnome-shell-theme.gresource`. Use `gresource` to read it without needing the source checkout.

List available resources:

```sh
gresource list /usr/lib64/gnome-shell/libshell-18.so
gresource list /usr/share/gnome-shell/gnome-shell-theme.gresource
```

Extract a specific file:

```sh
gresource extract /usr/lib64/gnome-shell/libshell-18.so /org/gnome/shell/ui/dash.js
gresource extract /usr/share/gnome-shell/gnome-shell-theme.gresource /org/gnome/shell/theme/gnome-shell-dark.css
```

Extract css file:

Common files of interest:

- `/org/gnome/shell/ui/dash.js` — Dash widget (DashIcon, Dash class, DnD handling)
- `/org/gnome/shell/ui/appFavorites.js` — AppFavorites (reads/writes `favorite-apps` gsettings)
- `/org/gnome/shell/ui/dnd.js` — drag-and-drop infrastructure (DragMotionResult, DragDropResult)
- `/org/gnome/shell/ui/main.js` — global singletons (layoutManager, overview, etc.)
- `/org/gnome/shell/theme/gnome-shell-dark.css` — stylesheets
