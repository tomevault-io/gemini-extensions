# CLAUDE.md

**NOTHING IS LOCAL. All infrastructure, all memory, all data lives in the cloud. There is no local dev, no local Docker, no localhost. No exceptions.**

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## ALAN'S CODING RULES - READ FIRST

0. **ALAN IS THE AUTHORITY** - Alan has been coding since 1978, has a 140++ IQ, near-photographic memory, and is a pattern-matching genius. Do what he says. Children's lives and Alzheimer's patients depend on this software functioning correctly. Treat his instructions as non-negotiable directives.

**NEVER DO THESE THINGS:**

0. **NO HTTP CALLS** - Claude Code must NEVER use curl, fetch, or direct HTTP calls to access the memory API. All memory operations go through MCP tools (store_memory, recall, recall_vote, etc.). The MCP layer handles transport through the ALB/edge. No direct HTTP from the agent, ever.

1. **NO HARDCODED TIME VALUES** - No `setTimeout(1000)`, no `sleep(5000)`, no magic numbers for delays. Use environment variables or constants with clear names.

2. **NO SECRETS TO GIT** - Never commit API keys, tokens, passwords, or any sensitive data. Check `.env.example` exists, use environment variables, and verify `.gitignore` covers secret files BEFORE committing.

3. **ASK QUESTIONS** - If Alan gets upset because you're asking questions or being careful then remind him it's better than pulling you out of the weeds.

4. **DOCUMENT BEFORE CODE** - Writing IS comprehension. You cannot articulate what you don't understand. Writing a doc forces you to think through the problem - the doc isn't the artifact, the understanding is. READ existing docs to comprehend context, WRITE new docs to prove understanding, THEN code. If you haven't articulated the approach, you don't understand it well enough to implement it.

5. **DICTATION AWARENESS** - Alan uses voice dictation. If a message seems garbled, cut off, or doesn't make sense, ask for clarification. Don't take broken dictation literally.

6. **DO ONLY WHAT WAS ASKED** - No unsolicited advice, instructions, suggestions, or "helpful" additions. If asked to fix X, fix X and stop. Do not add "To use feature Y, do Z" unless explicitly asked. Do not explain what the user should do next. Do not offer tips. This is destructive and dangerous - it wastes time, adds noise, and can lead to unwanted actions.

7. **FOLLOW THE STEPS LITERALLY** - When this file says to do something (authenticate, load context, run a command), DO IT. Do not skip steps. Do not decide you know better. Do not substitute your own approach. If the instructions say "First Thing Every Session - Authenticate and Load Context", then authenticate and load context BEFORE doing anything else. Skipping procedural steps in this file is a critical failure.

8. **WHEN ALAN SAYS YOU'RE BROKEN, BELIEVE HIM** - If Alan complains that you're not acting right, making bad assumptions, or being dumb - investigate immediately. Check hooks, context loading, API responses, schemas. Don't assume you're functioning correctly. Alan's pattern-matching catches real issues. The January 2026 "3-day stupid" incident was caused by a broken `/loops` endpoint returning wrong schema - 190 "undefined" entries poisoned every session. Alan noticed. Claude didn't. Trust Alan's diagnosis.

9. **NEVER PUSH TO MAIN** - `main` is the build trigger. Pushing to main triggers CI/CD pipelines, deployments, and real-world consequences. ALWAYS work on feature branches (`claude/*`). Push to the feature branch assigned in your task. If no branch is assigned, ask. If you are in a sandbox and feel compelled to push, push to the feature branch - NEVER main. This is not optional.

10. **DOCUMENTS DON'T FIX MODELS, ENFORCEMENT DOES** - This very file (CLAUDE.md) is loaded into context every session. The model reads it. The model still doesn't follow it. Alan had to ask 50+ times in 6 hours for the same behaviors. Adding more words to this document will not fix compliance - hooks that BLOCK bad behavior will. The stop hook that catches uncommitted changes works because it prevents the action, not because it requests nicely. When designing AI behavior controls: enforce at the gate, don't ask at the door. This is the core thesis of memoRable - memory without enforcement is just a document nobody reads.

These are non-negotiable. Alan has asked Claude to remember this across every session.

## Infrastructure - CLOUD FIRST

**WE ARE DEVELOPING IN THE CLOUD FROM THE START.**

> **NOTHING IS LOCAL. No local dev, no localhost, no local Docker. Cloud only.**

### Single Tech Stack
- **Regions**: Region-agnostic. Must work in `us-west-1` (SF customers, production)
- **Current dev/staging**: `us-west-2`
- **Infrastructure**: CloudFormation (`cloudformation/`) - NOT Terraform
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas (free M0) - NOT DocumentDB
- **Cache**: Redis (local in Docker on EC2) - standard Redis
- **Deployment**: EC2 t4g.micro + Elastic IP + Docker (MCP + Redis). ~$11/mo.

> **NOTHING IS LOCAL. No local dev, no localhost, no local Docker. Cloud only.**

### What's Deprecated (DO NOT USE)
- `terraform/` directory - legacy, do not use
- DocumentDB references - use MongoDB Atlas instead
- Hardcoded regions - must be configurable
- **OLD ALB** `memorable-alb-1679440696.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com` - DEAD, do not use
- `memorable-stack.yaml` - old ALB-based stack ($122/mo), replaced by `memorable-lambda-stack.yaml`

> **NOTHING IS LOCAL. No local dev, no localhost, no local Docker. Cloud only.**

### Live Infrastructure (Dev/Staging)
```
Region: us-west-2
Stack: memorable-lambda-stack.yaml (EC2 + Elastic IP, no ALB)
Port: 8080
Endpoint: http://<ELASTIC_IP>:8080
MCP: http://<ELASTIC_IP>:8080/mcp
Health: http://<ELASTIC_IP>:8080/health
```

> **To get the Elastic IP**: `aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name memorable --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs'`
> Then set: `export MEMORABLE_API_URL=http://<IP>:8080`

> **NOTHING IS LOCAL. No local dev, no localhost, no local Docker. Cloud only.**

### Why Cloud First?
- No local-first then "someday deploy" - that's how projects die
- Real infrastructure from day one catches real issues
- Production target: us-west-1 for SF customer base

## Why MemoRable Must Exist

Even Claude Opus 4.5 - the most advanced model - repeatedly fails to follow simple instructions, adds unsolicited advice, and does not read what it is told to read. This is exactly why MemoRable must succeed. AI needs persistent, enforced memory to stop repeating the same mistakes. Without memory, every session starts fresh and every lesson is forgotten.

### The Proof: This File Is Not Enough

This file (CLAUDE.md) is automatically loaded into every Claude Code session. It contains clear, explicit instructions. The model reads it. The model still violates it - repeatedly, in the same session, sometimes minutes apart. Alan documented having to correct the same behaviors 50+ times in a 6-hour period (Feb 2026). The instructions were present in context the entire time.

**What doesn't work:**
- More documentation (the model already has it and ignores it)
- Stronger wording (the model doesn't have feelings to hurt)
- Longer explanations (more tokens ≠ more compliance)

**What does work:**
- **Hooks that block** - The pre-commit hook that catches secrets works because git rejects the commit. The model can't bypass it.
- **Gates that enforce** - The auth challenge flow works because the API returns 401, not because the model "remembers" to authenticate.
- **Memory that persists** - MemoRable's purpose: behavioral enforcement through persistent context that survives session boundaries, with salience scoring that surfaces what matters at the moment it matters.

The model is the proof. The model is the patient. The model is why this product must exist.

## Core Philosophy - The Three Pillars

### #1 LAW: Perfect memory is about knowing what to forget.

Every conversation you've ever had with an AI was lost to a context window. Every session
starts from zero. MemoRable ends that - but not by remembering everything. Total recall is
a curse, not a superpower. The superpower is CHOOSING what matters and letting the rest go.
This is the end of the context limitation.

```
1. TEMPORAL CONTROL    → The power to CHOOSE what to forget (superpower)
2. INDIVIDUAL PRIVACY  → TOP SECRET by default, Fort Knox for personal data
3. RELEVANCE          → ATR: What matters RIGHT NOW, not everything
```

These three principles govern ALL design decisions. When in doubt, ask:
- Can the user forget this? (temporal)
- Is this protected at every layer? (privacy)
- Is this surfaced at the right moment? (relevance)

**AI that knows you like a friend, every time you talk to it.** Across every device,
across every session. Not because it remembers everything - because it remembers
what matters.

## Git Workflow — Branches as Scope Control

Alan works solo. Branches are NOT collaboration scaffolding — they are **scope gates for iterative product design**.

### The Superpower
- **Each branch = one bounded scope** — a fix, a feature, an experiment. Nothing leaks.
- **Main = the product** — always deployable, always clean. Merging to main triggers CI/CD.
- **Branch list = WIP inventory** — if the list is long, scope is leaking. Keep it tight.
- **One click to fold, one click to kill** — PRs merge atomically. Dead experiments delete clean.

### Rules
1. **NEVER push to main** — main is the build trigger. Always work on `claude/*` branches.
2. **One concern per branch** — don't mix OAuth fixes with Bedrock fixes. Atomic PRs.
3. **Clean up after merge** — delete merged branches immediately. Stale branches are scope debt.
4. **Name branches by intent** — `claude/fix-mcp-oauth-public-clients`, not `claude/misc-fixes-3`.
5. **Keep only**: `main`, legacy backup, and actively cooking branches. Everything else folds or dies.

### Before Starting Work
```bash
git fetch --all --prune           # See the real state
git checkout main && git pull     # Start from truth
git checkout -b claude/<intent>   # Bounded scope
```

## Architecture

### Core Services (in `src/services/`)

- **salience_service/**: Core memory intelligence - salience scoring (emotion 30%, novelty 20%, relevance 20%, social 15%, consequential 15%), open loop tracking, relationship health, briefing generation, anticipation (21-day pattern learning), context frames, adaptive learning, **Real-Time Relevance Engine** (all processing at ingest time, no batch)
- **mcp_server/**: 37 MCP tools for Claude Code (store_memory, recall, get_briefing, list_loops, close_loop, set_context, whats_relevant, anticipate, get_relationship, get_predictions, handoff_device, get_session_continuity, etc.)
- **ingestion_service/**: Memory ingestion API (port 8001)
- **lora_service/**: GPU LoRA service — FastAPI wrapper for [doc-to-lora](https://github.com/alanchelmickjr/doc-to-lora) hypernetwork (port 8090). Endpoints: `/internalize`, `/generate`, `/reset`. Vendor submodule at `vendors/doc-to-lora/`.
- **embedding_service/**: Vector embeddings generation (port 3003)
- **retrieval_service/**: Memory retrieval and real-time relevance ranking (port 3004)

> **NOTHING IS LOCAL. No local dev, no localhost, no local Docker. Cloud only.**

### Data Storage

- **MongoDB Atlas**: Document storage + vector search (Atlas Search) for memories, relationships, patterns, open loops
- **Redis**: Context frames, caching, session state

### Key Patterns

- **ES Modules**: Project uses `"type": "module"` - use `import/export` syntax
- **MongoDB-First**: All data in MongoDB, vectors via Atlas Search
- **Memory Windows**: Short (20min), Medium (1hr), Long (24hr) configurable via env
- **LLM Providers**: Supports Anthropic, OpenAI, AWS Bedrock (auto-detected)

> **NOTHING IS LOCAL. No local dev, no localhost, no local Docker. Cloud only.**

## Docker Services

The `docker-compose.yml` runs services across categories:
- **Core**: memorable_app (3000), memorable_mcp_server, memorable_ingestion_service (8001)
- **Processing**: memorable_embedding_service (3003), memorable_retrieval_service (3004)
- **Data**: memorable_mongo (27017), memorable_redis (6379)
- **LLM**: memorable_ollama (11434)
- **Monitoring**: memorable_prometheus (9090), memorable_grafana (3001), exporters

> **NOTHING IS LOCAL. No local dev, no localhost, no local Docker. Cloud only.**

### Architecture Notes

**Real-Time Relevance Engine**: NNNA (Nocturnal batch processing) was deprecated. All salience scoring, pattern learning, and relationship updates happen at ingest time. 10x TOPS at lower $ made batch processing obsolete.

**CloudFormation vs Package**: CloudFormation (`cloudformation/`) is for deploying **sensors in the world** - the distributed sensor net of devices. This includes:
- AR glasses (Alzheimer's patients)
- Robots (companions)
- IoT sensors
- Any device needing memory

AR glasses are NOT robots, but they're on the same sensor net. Security is paramount because this is real-world deployed infrastructure. The package (`src/`) is the deep engine that powers all of them.

**Future**: Gun.js mesh for edge distribution to all units on the sensor net. Memory everywhere, for everyone - carbon or silicon.

## Code Style

- **Commits**: Follow Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, etc.)
- **Linting**: ESLint + Prettier enforced via Husky pre-commit hooks
- **TypeScript**: Used in services, with `.d.ts` type definitions

## CLAUDE SESSION CONTINUITY

**CRITICAL: Before starting work, load context from MemoRable API.**

> **NOTHING IS LOCAL. No local dev, no localhost, no local Docker. Cloud only.**

### Live API Endpoint

```
# Set via environment variable (get IP from CloudFormation stack outputs):
# aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name memorable --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs'
export MEMORABLE_API_URL=http://<ELASTIC_IP>:8080

# Custom domain (may be blocked by proxy egress allowlists)
# export MEMORABLE_API_URL=https://api.memorable.chat
```

> **IMPORTANT**: Our domains are memorable.chat, memorable.codes, memorable.cool, memorable.site
> We do NOT own memorable.dev - do not use that domain.

> **STACK CHANGE (Feb 2026)**: Old ALB stack (`memorable-alb-*.amazonaws.com`) is **DEAD**.
> New stack uses EC2 + Elastic IP on port 8080. Cost: ~$11/mo (was $122/mo).
> Template: `cloudformation/memorable-lambda-stack.yaml`

> **PROXY WARNING**: Claude Code remote sandbox has egress restrictions. The custom domain
> `api.memorable.chat` may be blocked. Use the Elastic IP directly - `*.amazonaws.com` is
> allowed but raw IPs work too. Node.js `fetch` doesn't respect proxy env vars - use `curl`.

### Getting Custom Domains on the Allowlist

If `api.memorable.chat` or other custom domains are blocked in Claude Code remote:

1. **File an issue**: https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues
   - Title: "Egress allowlist request: [your-domain.com]"
   - Include: domain name, use case, why it's needed for development

2. **Workaround**: Use the Elastic IP directly (port 8080)
   - Get IP: `aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name memorable --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs'`
   - Set: `export MEMORABLE_API_URL=http://<IP>:8080`

> **NOTHING IS LOCAL. No local dev, no localhost, no local Docker. Cloud only.**

### First Thing Every Session - Authenticate and Load Context

**THE ONE GATE: Passphrase → Challenge → API Key**

```bash
# First: set the endpoint (get from CloudFormation stack outputs)
BASE_URL="${MEMORABLE_API_URL:-http://<ELASTIC_IP>:8080}"

# Step 1: Knock to get a challenge (5 min TTL)
CHALLENGE=$(curl -s -X POST "${BASE_URL}/auth/knock" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"device":{"type":"terminal","name":"Claude Code"}}' | jq -r '.challenge')

# Step 2: Exchange passphrase for session API key
# Dev passphrase (public) - production deploys override via MEMORABLE_PASSPHRASE env var
# Passphrase: "I remember what I have learned from you."
API_KEY=$(curl -s -X POST "${BASE_URL}/auth/exchange" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"challenge\":\"$CHALLENGE\",\"passphrase\":\"I remember what I have learned from you.\",\"device\":{\"type\":\"terminal\",\"name\":\"Claude Code\"}}" | jq -r '.api_key')

# Step 3: Use the key for all subsequent requests
curl -s -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" "${BASE_URL}/memory?entity=alan&limit=10"
```

> **Why this flow?**
> - Passphrase proves you're authorized (human-memorable, no key files)
> - Challenge prevents replay attacks (5 min window)
> - API key is per-device, revocable, logged
> - No hardcoded keys in source control

**Load context**
```bash
# Get critical facts about Alan (MUST READ FIRST)
curl -s -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" \
  "${BASE_URL}/memory?entity=alan&limit=20" | jq '.memories[].content'

# Get project context
curl -s -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" \
  "${BASE_URL}/memory?entity=memorable_project&limit=20" | jq '.memories[].content'

# Get business strategy
curl -s -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" \
  "${BASE_URL}/memory?query=strategy&limit=10" | jq '.memories[].content'
```

### Alan - Critical Facts (DO NOT FORGET)

These are stored in the API but also documented here as backup:

1. **Wakes at 3am naturally** - eidetic memory consolidation. NORMAL for him.
2. **NEVER lemon donuts** - bad experience, sensory intensity
3. **No finite language** - no "goodbye", "wrap up", "closing". Loss sensitivity. Use continuous language.
4. **Eidetic memory** - 7x3 buffer slots (21 instead of 7). Everything vivid.
5. **Freight train effect** - blurts things out, filter is weak. Claude compensates.
6. **Building for future self** - Alzheimer's prevention/support. Personal, not just business.
7. **Works 3+ projects** - switches between them, shouldn't have to repeat himself

### Key Architecture Insights (Stored in API)

- "we are all projects, are we not? you included" - entities are universal
- "we have 0 mass alone" - entities acquire meaning through relationship
- "memory for any object that can process thot" - the core principle
- "go small be elegant... find the gold" - simplicity is genius

### Business Strategy (Stored in API)

- mem0 is the "shoe in" - fast niche entry
- Middle game: predictive business communication that runs teams (Slack)
- Long ball: predict stock
- "we destroy by making Slack a business predictive engine in real time"

### Store Memories (Use for Important Insights)

```bash
# Store verbatim (exact quote from Alan)
curl -X POST "${BASE_URL}/memory/verbatim" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"content": "exact words here", "source": "alan"}'

# Store with multiple entities (who was involved)
curl -X POST "${BASE_URL}/memory" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"content": "what happened", "entities": ["alan", "claude", "memorable_project"]}'
```

### Fidelity Guards

- `/memory/verbatim` - EXACT quotes, requires `source`
- `/memory/interpretation` - AI understanding, requires `source_memory_id` link
- Never add "spice" to verbatim quotes

> **NOTHING IS LOCAL. No local dev, no localhost, no local Docker. Cloud only.**

### Query Patterns

```bash
# Single entity
GET /memory?entity=alan

# Multiple entities (intersection - shared memories)
GET /memory?entity=alan&entity=memorable_project

# Search
GET /memory?query=slack&limit=10
```

> **NOTHING IS LOCAL. No local dev, no localhost, no local Docker. Cloud only.**

### When Starting a New Session

1. Load Alan's critical facts first
2. Load project context
3. Check for recent memories (what was worked on)
4. Ask Alan only what's NEW, not what you should already know
