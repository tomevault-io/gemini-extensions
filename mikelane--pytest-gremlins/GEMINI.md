# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

pytest-gremlins is a **fast-first** mutation testing plugin for pytest. Speed is the primary
differentiator - we aim to make mutation testing practical for everyday TDD, not just overnight
CI jobs.

## Design Documents

- [North Star](docs/design/NORTH_STAR.md) - Vision, speed architecture, success metrics
- [Operators](docs/design/OPERATORS.md) - Mutation operators design and registry
- [Agent Guidelines](docs/design/AGENT_GUIDELINES.md) - TDD laws, BDD process, CI/CD, release process

## Core Architecture (Speed-First)

Four pillars drive our speed strategy:

1. **Mutation Switching** - Instrument code once with all mutations embedded, toggle via environment
   variable. No file I/O, no module reloads during test runs.

2. **Coverage-Guided Test Selection** - Only run tests that actually cover the mutated code. 10-100x reduction in test executions.

3. **Incremental Analysis** - Cache results keyed by content hashes. Skip unchanged code/tests on subsequent runs.

4. **Parallel Execution** - Distribute gremlins across worker processes. Mutation switching makes
   this safe (no shared mutable state).

## Domain Language

| Traditional Term       | Gremlin Term            |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Original code          | **Mogwai**              |
| Start mutation testing | **Feed after midnight** |
| Mutant                 | **Gremlin**             |
| Kill mutant            | **Zap**                 |
| Surviving mutant       | **Survivor**            |

## Build Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
uv sync --dev

# Run small tests only (fast, always safe)
uv run pytest tests -m small

# Run small + medium tests (PR checks)
uv run pytest tests -m "small or medium"

# Run all tests
uv run pytest

# Type checking (strict)
uv run mypy src/pytest_gremlins

# Linting
uv run ruff check src tests

# Formatting
uv run ruff format src tests

# All checks (what pre-commit runs)
uv run pre-commit run --all-files

# Multi-version testing
uv run tox

# Build docs
uv run mkdocs build --strict

# Run doctests
# Filesystem isolation checks are disabled: doctests can't carry pytest markers,
# so pytest-test-categories flags pdb reading its config file as a violation.
uv run pytest --doctest-modules src/pytest_gremlins --override-ini="test_categories_enforcement=disabled"
```

## CI Caching

pytest-gremlins uses a two-layer cache in CI:

1. **CI platform cache** (outer) — stores `.gremlins_cache/` between jobs
2. **IncrementalCache** (inner) — per-gremlin results by content hash

**Critical rules for CI cache configuration:**

- Use `hashFiles` on source + test files + `pyproject.toml` (NOT commit SHA)
- Always use `restore-keys` prefix fallback (so a file change gets a warm cache)
- Save the cache with `if: always()` — threshold check failures must NOT discard the cache
- Use split restore/save steps (not combined `actions/cache`) so `if: always()` works

**Why `if: always()` matters:** A failing threshold check exits the job non-zero. CI
skips subsequent steps by default, so the cache save never runs and the next job starts
cold. `if: always()` overrides that — the save runs even when the score gate fails, so
the next run only re-tests what changed.

## TDD Laws (STRICTLY ENFORCED)

1. **No production code without a failing test**
2. **Only enough test code to fail**
3. **Only enough production code to pass**
4. **Refactor only when green**

## Code Style

- **Quotes:** Single quotes
- **Line length:** 120 characters
- **Type hints:** Required (strict mypy)
- **Docstrings:** Google style with doctests
- **Test names:** No "should" - use declarative statements

## Key Files

- `pyproject.toml` - All tool configuration (ruff, mypy, pytest, coverage, commitizen)
- `tox.ini` - Multi-Python version testing (3.11-3.14)
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` - Pre-commit hooks
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - CI pipeline
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` - Release pipeline with Test PyPI
- `.github/workflows/cut-release.yml` - One-click version bump + tag (triggers release.yml)
- `scripts/release.sh` - Local release script (same thing, from your terminal)

## Release Process

**Step 1 -- Update CHANGELOG.md.** The workflow guard fails if there are no commits since
the last tag -- the changelog commit is what satisfies it. Add a `## vX.Y.Z (date)` entry
above the most recent section. Merge the CHANGELOG PR to main before proceeding.

**Step 2 -- Dispatch the workflow.** Never run `cz bump` locally -- the `no-commit-to-branch`
pre-commit hook blocks commits to `main` and leaves a dirty version bump to revert.

```bash
gh workflow run cut-release.yml --repo mikelane/pytest-gremlins
```

This runs `cz bump` on the GitHub Actions runner (no local hooks), commits the version,
creates an annotated tag, and pushes -- which triggers `release.yml`.

**Step 3 -- Verify the tag landed:**

```bash
git fetch --tags
git ls-remote --tags origin | tail -5
```

If the tag is missing, `--follow-tags` silently skipped a lightweight tag. Root cause:
`[tool.commitizen]` must have `annotated_tag = true`. Without it, commitizen creates
lightweight tags that `--follow-tags` ignores.

**RELEASE_PAT secret**: The workflow requires a `RELEASE_PAT` repo secret with
`contents: write` and `workflows: write` scopes. Set it to never expire — an expired
PAT causes a silent checkout failure with no useful error message.

## Demo Videos

Narrated MP4 demos live on YouTube (not committed to git). The `.gitignore` excludes `*.mp4` and `*.webm`.

Demo project files live under `/tmp/gremlin-demo-<epic>` (or similar per-epic dirs).
Each demo project's `pyproject.toml` must include `pytest-xdist` as a dependency —
the dev plugin registers a `pytest_configure_node` hook that pluggy rejects at
`check_pending()` if xdist is absent, causing silent `pytest_sessionfinish` failure
(the HTML report never writes).
