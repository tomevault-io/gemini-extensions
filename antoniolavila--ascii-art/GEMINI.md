# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

```bash
./run.sh                  # start everything at http://localhost:8000 (creates/syncs .venv itself)
PORT=9000 ./run.sh        # different port
uv run python -c "..."    # run anything against the project venv
uv add <pkg>              # add a dependency (updates pyproject.toml + uv.lock)
```

`run.sh` scopes `--reload` to `server/` on purpose: watching the whole tree would restart the
server on every upload written into `media/`.

## Environment constraints

These are hard limits on this machine, not preferences — check before proposing a change that
assumes otherwise:

- **No Node/npm, and no `pip`** (`ensurepip` is broken). `uv` is the only route to packages.
- **The frontend has no build step.** `web/` is plain ES modules served straight off disk.
  Introducing a bundler would mean introducing a Node toolchain that isn't there.
- **ffmpeg and ffprobe must be on `PATH`** — the whole server side is built on them.
- Fonts are *discovered* on the machine (`server/fonts.py`), not vendored. The list can differ
  per machine; code must tolerate a font key being absent (`fonts.get` falls back).

## Architecture

### The invariant that matters most

The same image has to come out of **three renderers**:

| Renderer | File | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| GLSL fragment shader | `web/js/gl/renderer.js` | the live preview |
| JS on the CPU | `web/js/sample.js` | TXT / ANSI / HTML / clipboard export |
| numpy | `server/ascii_core.py` | MP4 / WebM / GIF export |

The adjustment, noise-field and glyph-selection maths therefore lives in **one module per
language**:
`web/js/adjust.js` (which also emits the GLSL as a template string) and `server/settings.py`.
**Editing the maths in one place without the other two silently desynchronises exports from
the preview.** Both files say so in their docstrings.

Verified parity: identical glyph choice on 500 randomised inputs, and on a full cell grid
across all eight combinations of dither mode × noise field. On a real frame the browser and
server agree on ~93% of cells and are never more than one ramp step apart, the remainder being
the difference between the browser's downscale and ffmpeg's.

**Two rules decide where a new effect goes.** If a fragment shader can evaluate it per cell
from position and time — the adjustments, the noise field, ordered dithering — write it twice
in `adjust.js` (JS + GLSL) and once in `settings.py`. If it is sequential, it cannot go in the
shader at all: **Floyd–Steinberg and Atkinson run on the CPU** in `computeIndices` /
`compute_indices`, and the finished glyph indices are uploaded as an R8 texture that the
shader reads instead of picking a glyph itself (`uDitherMode == 2`). The grid is only a few
thousand cells, so this still runs per frame during playback.

Anything random must use `hash2`, the exact 32-bit integer hash. **Do not reach for
`fract(sin(...))`** — it differs between GPU vendors and between GPU and CPU, which silently
desynchronises the preview from exports. Only its top 24 bits become a float, so the value is
exactly representable in a shader's 32-bit floats.

### The frame pipeline

Every frame is first reduced to **one average colour per character cell**, and that tiny
`cols × rows` grid is the only per-frame data the renderers see. This is why frame cost is
independent of how many characters are on screen.

- Browser: `drawImage` into a `cols × rows` canvas (`web/js/sample.js`), done by **repeated
  halving** so large reductions don't alias.
- Server: `ffmpeg -vf scale=cols:rows:flags=$SCALE_FLAGS` (`server/media.py`).

`SCALE_FLAGS` is `bilinear` because it was *measured* as the closest match to the browser's
halving chain (7 scalers compared). Changing it re-opens the preview/export parity question.

Two details that exist to protect grid parity:

- The client sends **both `cols` and `rows`** in the export payload rather than letting the
  server re-derive rows from font metrics and land on a different number.
- The backend serves the browser the **same TTF file** Pillow rasterises for exports
  (`/api/fonts/{key}.ttf` + `@font-face`), so glyphs are identical in preview and video.

### Animated input is normalised to WebM

On upload, a GIF is transcoded to VP9 WebM (`server/media.py: normalize_to_webm`). Browsers
cannot seek the frames of a GIF but seek video natively, so after this conversion the frontend
has exactly two source kinds — still image or `<video>` (`web/js/source.js`) — and playback and
scrubbing are one code path. `meta.playback` names the file the browser previews;
`meta.source` is the original, kept for export.

Video seeking depends on HTTP Range, which Starlette's `FileResponse` handles natively. Don't
replace it with a plain byte-stream response.

### Where exports run

Split deliberately, in `web/js/export.js`:

- **In the browser** (instant, no round trip): PNG via `canvas.toBlob` — which is why the GL
  context is created with `preserveDrawingBuffer: true` — plus TXT, 24-bit ANSI, standalone
  HTML and clipboard, all built from `gridToChars`/`gridToColors`.
- **On the server**: MP4 / WebM / GIF, because the browser can't write those. `POST /api/export`
  queues a job on a thread pool (`server/jobs.py` — ffmpeg is blocking and must stay off the
  event loop) and progress streams back over SSE at `/api/export/{id}/events`.

### Conventions

- The noise field runs off a **video's own playhead** (`sourceTime()` in `main.js`, and
  `start + n/fps` server-side), not wall time, so an exported frame matches the preview of the
  same frame. Wall time is used only for stills. An animating effect also forces the render
  loop to keep drawing — see `app.animating`.
- **Character ramps are ordered dark → light**: index 0 is what a black cell becomes.
  `web/js/charsets.js` holds the presets.
- `state.rampInput` is what the user typed; `state.charset` is what actually renders (they
  differ when *Sort by ink density* is on). Keep both — that's what makes the toggle lossless.
- `web/js/main.js` owns all state and the rAF loop; it renders only when `app.dirty` is set or
  a video is playing. Any control that changes output must call `markDirty()`.
- Uploads in `media/` are deleted by the client as new files load, and stale ones are reaped at
  startup (`server/routes.py: reap_stale_media`). `media/` is gitignored.

## Verification

There is **no test suite**. Verification is done by driving the real app; the tooling comes from
PyPI at call time, so nothing is added to `pyproject.toml`:

```bash
# JS syntax check (Node via a PyPI wheel — dev-time only, not a dependency)
uv run --with nodejs-wheel-binaries python -c "
import sys; from nodejs_wheel import node
sys.exit(node(['--check', 'web/js/main.js'], return_completed_process=True).returncode)"

# Browser automation; install once
uv run --with playwright playwright install chromium
```

Playwright must launch Chromium with these args here — the sandbox blocks user namespaces and
there is no GPU:

```
--no-sandbox --use-gl=angle --use-angle=swiftshader --enable-unsafe-swiftshader
--autoplay-policy=no-user-gesture-required
```

Wait on `#gl.is-ready` (set after the first successful render) and subscribe to `pageerror` —
`web/js/main.js` also routes uncaught errors to the on-screen toast, so failures are visible
rather than silent. Software rendering still hits ~60fps at 120 columns; a large drop there is a
real regression, not the test environment.

Worth re-running after changes to the render path: the JS↔Python glyph parity check (random
RGB + adjustment values through both `adjust.js` and `server/settings.py`, asserting identical
glyph indices), and a round trip through each export format checked with
`ffprobe -v error -show_entries stream=codec_name,width,height,nb_frames`.
