# Picbreeder-VLM Codebase Documentation

This document serves as a guide for agents and developers working on the Picbreeder-VLM project. It outlines the project architecture, key files, and operational workflows.

## 📦 Package layout

The Python source lives in the **`picbreeder_vlm/`** package (install once with
`pip install -e .`). Modules are grouped into subpackages:

| subpackage | what's in it |
| --- | --- |
| `picbreeder_vlm.core` | config, constants, utils, rendering, `neat_components`, `picbreeder_reproduction`, `archive_manager`, `genome_json`, artifacts |
| `picbreeder_vlm.vlm` | `vlm_backends`, chat, prompts, im_query, personalities, model_loader |
| `picbreeder_vlm.agents` | `collaborative_multi_agent`, `agent_runner` |
| `picbreeder_vlm.experiments` | `sweep`, `sweep_configs`, sweep utils, `experiment_cli` |
| `picbreeder_vlm.analysis` | coverage / embedding / captioning / phylogeny / ratings metrics |
| `picbreeder_vlm.viz` | `visualize_*`, `render_*` figure generators |
| `picbreeder_vlm.niches` | `clip_noun_niche_*` CLIP evolution-strategy experiments |
| `picbreeder_vlm.nouns` | noun-list / ImageNet vocabulary wrangling |
| `picbreeder_vlm.bench` | VLM benchmarking, probing, ad-hoc tests |

Run modules as `.venv/bin/python -m picbreeder_vlm.<sub>.<module>` (e.g.
`... -m picbreeder_vlm.experiments.sweep`). The bare filenames below name the
module; e.g. **`sweep.py`** ⇒ `picbreeder_vlm.experiments.sweep`.

> **Pickle compat:** thin shims at the repo root (`neat_components.py`,
> `config.py`, `picbreeder_reproduction.py`, `archive_manager.py`, `rendering.py`)
> re-export from the package so existing archive/HF genome `.pkl` files (which
> store the original module paths) still `pickle.load`. Don't delete them.

## ✅ Tests

```bash
uv pip install -r requirements-test.txt   # NOT requirements.txt: no torch / vLLM
pytest                                    # ~60 tests, a couple of seconds
```

`.github/workflows/tests.yml` runs this on every push and PR (Python 3.11 + 3.13).
The suite exists to catch what a reorg breaks quietly, so it pins the contracts
rather than the implementation:

*   **Run-directory names** (`tests/test_config.py`) are goldens copied from published
    runs. `ensure_valid_config` builds them, sweeps and every tool glob them, and the
    HF archive is keyed by them. A rename orphans data — if a test here fails, do not
    "update the golden" without knowing what it costs.
*   **Pickle shims** (`tests/test_compat_shims.py`) must resolve to the *same class
    objects* as the package, or archived genomes stop unpickling.
*   **The NEAT preset** (`tests/test_neat_preset.py`) has to load and render
    deterministically; archive images are regenerated from genomes on demand.
*   **`core.neat_components` must stay importable without torch / vLLM / google-genai.**
    That is enforced by a test, and it is why `build_neat_config` lives there rather
    than in `agents.collaborative_multi_agent`.

Keep tests import-light: `picbreeder_vlm.analysis.*` pulls in torch and open_clip at
module scope, so `tests/test_analysis_naming.py` inspects those modules with `ast`
instead of importing them.

## 🗺️ Project Roadmap

The codebase is organized into several distinct layers, from high-level orchestration to low-level evolutionary mechanics.

### 1. Orchestration & Configuration
*   **`sweep.py`**: The main entry point. Orchestrates experiments (sweeps) locally or on Slurm. It generates individual run configurations and launches them.
*   **`config.py`**: Defines the `PicbreederConfig` dataclass. This is the single source of truth for experiment settings (grid size, model choice, evolution parameters).
*   **`sweep_configs.py`**: Defines the search spaces for hyperparameters. Contains `SweepConfig` and named sweep classes (e.g., `ChatHistoryTurnsSweep`).

### 2. Core Agent Logic
*   **`collaborative_multi_agent.py`**: The heart of the simulation. It runs the main loop where agents join, evolve images, and publish to the shared archive.
*   **`agent_runner.py`**: Manages the lifecycle of a single agent process, handling its interaction with the NEAT population and the VLM.

### 3. VLM & AI Layer
*   **`vlm_backends.py`**: The unified interface for AI models. Abstracts away differences between Gemini, Qwen, and other models. Handles image/text queries and chat history.
*   **`chat.py`**: Manages conversation history and context for agents.
*   **`prompts.py`**: Stores system prompts and goal definitions used to guide the VLMs.

### 4. Evolutionary Engine (NEAT)
*   **`picbreeder_reproduction.py`**: Custom NEAT reproduction logic. Implements the specific crossover and mutation rules that emulate the original Picbreeder web app.
*   **`neat_components.py`**: Core NEAT utilities, including the `PicbreederGenome` class and stagnation logic.
*   **`interactive_config_color`**: The NEAT preset every entry point evolves against.
    It sits beside `picture2d.py`, the renderer that consumes it, because nothing ever
    swaps it out — it is effectively source. Resolve it via
    `picbreeder_vlm._paths.NEAT_CONFIG_PATH`, never by hardcoding the path.

### 5. Archive & State Management
*   **`archive_manager.py`**: Manages the persistent shared archive. Handles file locking, saving images/genomes, and tracking lineage/metadata (`ArchiveEntry`).

### 6. Analysis & Evaluation
*   **`embed_and_visualize.py`**: Generates embeddings (CLIP/SigLIP) for archives and creates visualizations (t-SNE/UMAP).
*   **`compute_semantic_recall.py`**: Measures how well evolved images match target nouns (alignment metrics).
*   **`plot_novelty_over_time.py`**: Visualizes the novelty of the archive over time.
*   **`tree_metrics.py`**: Calculates phylogenetic statistics (tree depth, branching factors).

# Sweep System Documentation

The `sweep.py` script is the primary entry point for launching collaborative multi-agent experiments. It is built on [Hydra](https://hydra.cc/) and [Submitit](https://github.com/facebookincubator/submitit).

## Core Concepts

*   **Sweep Configs**: Defined in `sweep_configs.py`. These classes (e.g., `ChatHistoryTurnsSweep`) define the search space. Fields with `List` types (e.g., `seed: List[int]`) are expanded into a Cartesian product of jobs.
*   **Run Config**: Defined in `config.py` (`PicbreederConfig`). This is the configuration for a single experiment run.
*   **Execution**: `sweep.py` generates individual `PicbreederConfig` objects from the selected `SweepConfig` and launches them either sequentially (local) or as array jobs (Slurm).

## Common Commands

### 1. Launch a Sweep Locally
Run the `chat_history_turns` sweep locally (no Slurm):
```bash
.venv/bin/python -m picbreeder_vlm.experiments.sweep sweep_name=chat_history_turns slurm=false
```

### 2. Launch on Slurm
Submit the same sweep to the cluster:
```bash
.venv/bin/python -m picbreeder_vlm.experiments.sweep sweep_name=chat_history_turns slurm=true
```

### 3. Run Evaluations
Evaluations are often run as a separate step after training. You can enable specific evaluation pipelines using flags. Note that you generally want to use the same `sweep_name` so it finds the correct experiment directories.

A few practical notes:
* Runs pulled from the HF dataset ship a cached image-embedding `.npz`, so the
  embedding-based evals reuse the cache and run fine on CPU.
* The default image embedding model (`image_embedding_model=SigLIP2-B-alignet`) is a
  vision-only TensorFlow SavedModel that is **not** bundled; to embed fresh images
  either point at a torch-native open_clip model (e.g.
  `image_embedding_model=ViT-B-32 image_pretrained=laion2b_s34b_b79k`) or rely on the
  shipped cache.
* `eval_tree` renders the phylogeny with Graphviz — install the system binary
  (`apt install graphviz`), not just the `graphviz` Python package.
* The cross-seed aggregate plots overlay optional human/random reference baselines; a
  fresh checkout may not have all of them, so a missing baseline is now warned-and-
  skipped rather than fatal (the per-run metrics are always written first).

**Visual Coverage (Novelty):**
```bash
.venv/bin/python -m picbreeder_vlm.experiments.sweep sweep_name=chat_history_turns eval_visual_coverage=true slurm=false
```

**Noun Coverage (Alignment):**
```bash
.venv/bin/python -m picbreeder_vlm.experiments.sweep sweep_name=chat_history_turns eval_semantic_recall=true slurm=false
```

**Phylogeny (Tree) Metrics:**
```bash
.venv/bin/python -m picbreeder_vlm.experiments.sweep sweep_name=chat_history_turns eval_tree=true slurm=false
```

### 4. Cross-Evaluation (Aggregation)
To aggregate results across all seeds and generate summary plots/tables:
```bash
.venv/bin/python -m picbreeder_vlm.experiments.sweep sweep_name=chat_history_turns cross_eval=true
```
This will look for completed runs in `sweep_logs/sweep/<run_name>/` (the sweep entry
point's default `log_dir` is `sweep_logs`; there is no `<sweep_name>` sub-directory)
and output results to `cross_eval/<sweep_name>`.

### CLI Overrides
You can override any parameter from the command line. CLI overrides take precedence over the named sweep defaults.

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m picbreeder_vlm.experiments.sweep sweep_name=chat_history_turns num_agents=50
```
This will run the `chat_history_turns` sweep but force `num_agents` to 50 for all runs.

## Adding a New Sweep

1.  Open `sweep_configs.py`.
2.  Define a new dataclass inheriting from `SweepConfig`.
3.  Override fields with lists of values to sweep over.
4.  Register it in `_NAMED_SWEEPS`.

Example:
```python
@dataclass
class MyNewSweep(SweepConfig):
    # Sweep over 3 seeds
    seed: List[int] = field(default_factory=lambda: [1, 2, 3])
    # Sweep over 2 models
    model: List[str] = field(default_factory=lambda: ["gemini-2.5-pro", "gemini-2.5-flash"])
```

│     └─ experiment_stats.json  # run statistics
└─ cross_eval/<sweep_name>/ # aggregated eval results (plots, tables, LaTeX)
```

`tools/pull_run_from_hf.py` reconstructs runs from the HF dataset into
`sweep_logs/sweep/<run_name>/` so the eval/figure commands find them. Resolve any
`third-party/fer/` path via `picbreeder_vlm._paths.FER_ROOT`; see `third-party/README.md`.

# Blog post & deploy

The interactive blog/report lives in the **`smearle.github.io`** repo (the
hand-edited HTML at `picbreeder-vlm-06b0d76d/index.html`; public home
<https://pub.sakana.ai/picbreeder-vlm>). The deploy workflow—where the
canonical files live, how the gallery data/sprites are staged and pushed to HF,
and how the `tools/build_*.py` asset builders feed it—is documented in that
repo's `AGENTS.md`. The asset-build tooling itself (`tools/build_*.py`,
`tools/add_lineage_layouts.py`, `tools/push_sprites.py`) lives in this repo.
