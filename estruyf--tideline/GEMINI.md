# Tideline

A macOS menu-bar app that files older downloads into folders named for the day
they arrived. Native Swift, SwiftPM, no dependencies — the release zip is about
1.7 MB, and 5.8 MB unpacked because the bundle is universal. That is a feature,
not an accident.

A Windows build lives in `windows/`: the same filing rules rewritten in Rust,
behind a Tauri v2 shell. It builds and its tests pass. The **filing engine is
complete** — grace window, daily and monthly folders, type folders, the skip
list, settling and collision rules. Clearing, duplicates, the big-file review,
catch-up, folder watching and the updater are **not ported yet**;
`windows/README.md` ranks what is left.

The two apps share no code, only a contract. Nothing in `windows/` should ever
be a reason to change `app/`, or the reverse — see `docs/behaviour.md`.

## Layout

| Path | |
| --- | --- |
| `app/Sources/Tideline/` | The app. `Organizer` files, `Cleaner` clears, `Deduper` collapses copies, `Weigher` finds big files, `Regrouper` catches up, `Controller` schedules |
| `app/Sources/Tideline/Views/` | SwiftUI window, one file per tab or sheet |
| `app/Package.swift` | One executable target, macOS 14+, zero dependencies |
| `app/build.sh` | Build, bundle, icon, sign, notarize, staple, zip |
| `app/Resources/Info.plist` | Bundle template; `__VERSION__` / `__BUILD__` substituted at build time |
| `windows/src-tauri/crates/tideline-core/` | The Rust filing engine. `organizer` holds the rules and is pure; `sweep` does the I/O |
| `windows/src-tauri/src/` | The Tauri shell — tray, schedule, commands, settings on disk |
| `windows/src/` | The window: plain HTML, CSS and JS, no framework and no build step |
| `docs/behaviour.md` | The filing contract both platforms implement |
| `fixtures/sweep-cases.json` | The contract as runnable cases. Add a rule here first |
| `homebrew/` | The Homebrew cask and the script that stamps it into `estruyf/homebrew-tap` |
| `docs/building.md`, `docs/signing.md`, `docs/releasing.md`, `docs/homebrew.md` | Build, distribution, release and cask notes |
| `windows/README.md` | Building on Windows, what is ported, what is not |
| `app/.build/`, `app/dist/`, `windows/**/target/`, `old-scripts/` | Ignored by git; never edit or commit |

## Commands

```bash
npm run build            # universal binary into app/dist/
npm run build:install    # build, copy to /Applications, launch it
npm run logs             # tail ~/Library/Logs/Tideline.log
npm run quit             # quit the running app
npm run clean            # throw away build artefacts
npm version patch        # bump, rebuild, commit and tag

npm run win:test         # the Rust workspace: 47 tests
npm run win:check        # type-check the engine against the Windows target
npm run win:dev          # run the Tauri app (works on a Mac too, see below)
npm run win:build        # NSIS installer — Windows only
```

`swift run` is not a useful way to test a change: it starts the executable
without a bundle, so there is no bundle identity and no scoped Downloads
permission. Build the app and run that instead.

## Verifying a change

There is no Swift test target. Confirm behaviour by running the real bundle:

1. `npm run build:install`
2. Switch on **Preview mode** under **Filing** — sweeps then report what they
   would do without touching a file.
3. `npm run logs` and watch a sweep decide.

The Rust side does have tests — `npm run win:test` runs all 45. The rules are
pure functions taking a list of entries and a moment, so a rule change is
provable without a filesystem; only `sweep.rs` needs a real folder.

The first-run flow — the permission prompt and the question that gates
filing — only happens once per machine. `docs/building.md` has the commands
that put the app back to knowing nothing about you.

`npm run win:dev` works on a Mac: it builds the same Rust and the same front end
into a macOS window, which is enough to iterate on the layout. The `cfg(windows)`
paths — the Recycle Bin, `FILE_ATTRIBUTE_HIDDEN` — are inert there and still
need real hardware. `npm run win:check` compiles them without running them.

Cross-*building* the installer from macOS does not work; CI builds it on
`windows-latest`.

## Rules that matter

- **`docs/behaviour.md` is the contract, and `fixtures/sweep-cases.json` is the
  executable half of it.** Any change to what moves, when, or where it lands is
  a change to the document and a case in the fixtures first, then to both
  implementations. They exist so the Swift and Rust engines cannot quietly
  drift. Only the Rust side runs the fixtures today; the Swift planner reads the
  filesystem directly and needs the same pure/IO split before it can.
- **Nothing is ever deleted.** Removals go to the Trash on macOS
  (`FileManager.trashItem`) and the Recycle Bin on Windows (`sweep::recycle`),
  never `unlink`. A setting someone regrets should be a drag back out, not a
  restore from backup.
- **Nothing is ever overwritten.** A name collision counts up: `report.pdf`,
  `report-1.pdf`, `report-2.pdf`.
- **Preview mode (`Settings.dryRun`) binds every destructive feature.** Filing,
  clearing, duplicate collapsing, large-file review and catch-up all have to
  honour it. A new feature that moves or trashes anything gets a preview path
  before it gets a button.
- **`package.json` is the macOS version, and the only one.** `build.sh` reads it
  into the plist — never hand-edit `CFBundleShortVersionString`. The release
  workflow refuses a tag that disagrees with it. The Windows build versions
  itself independently in `windows/package.json`, `tauri.conf.json` and its
  `Cargo.toml`, and sits at `0.1.0` until it reaches parity; the two ship on
  separate schedules and separate workflows.
- **The macOS app has no dependencies.** Neither SwiftPM nor npm; the root
  `package.json` is a shortcut to `build.sh` and nothing more. The Windows build
  necessarily has some (Tauri, chrono, serde, trash), but the same instinct
  applies — the front end is hand-written HTML and CSS rather than a framework,
  and it should stay that way.
- **The app is a background app** (`LSUIElement`). It has no Dock icon until the
  window is opened.

## Code conventions

- `Controller` is `@MainActor` and owns the schedule, the watcher and the run
  state. Filing runs on `runQueue`; anything that merely reads — measuring the
  folder, hashing for duplicates — goes on `inspectQueue` so a long look never
  delays a sweep.
- Settings live in `Settings.swift`, backed by `UserDefaults`. A new preference
  is a `Key`, a default in the registration dictionary, and an `@Published`
  property whose `didSet` calls `store(_:_:)` — which posts `.settingsChanged`
  for you.
- Anything persisted to disk (`history.json`) decodes leniently, with
  `decodeIfPresent` and a fallback, so an upgrade never blanks someone's
  activity list.
- **Colour comes from `Views/Theme.swift`, never from a literal or a system
  semantic.** `#ffd43b` is the accent and it is a filled-surface colour — its
  labels are `Theme.onAccent`, and accent-as-text is `Theme.accentText` so the
  light appearance can darken it. Keep the meanings apart: accent for what the
  app put there or is about to touch, `danger` for faults, `link` for a button
  that only navigates, `success` for running. Every token carries a light value
  and a dark one, so a new one is added in pairs.
- Comments explain **why**, in prose, in full sentences. The codebase reads like
  its own documentation — match that rather than annotating what the next line
  already says.
- The same voice runs through the README, the changelog and the UI strings:
  plain, specific, no marketing. New user-facing text should sound like the text
  already there.

On the Rust side:

- `tideline-core` knows nothing about Tauri, and `organizer.rs` knows nothing
  about the filesystem. A rule belongs in `plan`, which takes entries and a
  moment and returns what would move; reading a folder belongs in `sweep.rs`.
  That split is why a preview and a real sweep cannot disagree.
- `now` is passed in, never read inside a rule, so midnight and the grace window
  are testable without waiting for either.
- `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` both gate CI. Run them before
  pushing; the same prose-comment convention applies.

## Shipping a change

- Add a **Keep a Changelog** entry under a new version heading in `CHANGELOG.md`,
  written the way the existing entries are — what it does, and why it behaves
  the way it does.
- Update `README.md` if the change is visible in the window or the menu bar,
  `docs/behaviour.md` and `fixtures/sweep-cases.json` if it touches the filing
  rules, and `windows/README.md` if it changes what is ported.
- Commit messages are short and descriptive, in the imperative or past tense —
  match `git log`. Version bumps are their own commit, made by `npm version`.
- Releasing macOS is `npm version patch`, push the tag, then publish the release
  on GitHub; `release.yml` signs, notarizes, staples, attaches the zip and
  stamps the Homebrew cask into the tap. The in-app updater depends on the asset
  name and the notarization — `docs/releasing.md` has the details.
- **The cask is `homebrew/tideline.rb`, and it is generated into the tap, not
  edited there.** A change to it lands on the next release. `depends_on macos:`
  has to move whenever `LSMinimumSystemVersion` does, and the `zap` paths
  whenever `UninstallView` does — those are the two places it can silently fall
  out of step with the app. `docs/homebrew.md` says why each stanza is there.
- Windows has its own workflow, `windows.yml`. It tests on every push touching
  `windows/` or `fixtures/`, and builds the installer on demand. It is
  deliberately not tied to the release tag while the port is behind; make it
  `release: types: [published]` once it reaches parity.
