# AGENTS.md

This file is the operating manual for **every AI coding agent** working in this
repository. Read it fully before making any change. If a task ever conflicts
with this file, this file wins — stop and ask for clarification.

---

## 1. Project mission

This repository is a **declarative platform for building AI agent systems**.

Developers describe an agent system in YAML. The platform validates that YAML,
compiles it into a typed internal graph, and runs it through a long-lived
runtime that renders prompt files, calls resolver/tool plugins and MCP servers,
exposes an API, and produces execution traces.

The repository is in **active development**. The YAML validator, compiler,
runtime engine (orchestrators run as supervisor agents), resolver
plugin system, tool plugin loading, MCP client (local and remote servers,
including authenticated MCP via hooks), the runtime hooks system
(11 lifecycle points — see
[docs/RUNTIME_HOOKS.md](docs/RUNTIME_HOOKS.md)), per-run execution-limit
guardrails (see [docs/EXECUTION_LIMITS.md](docs/EXECUTION_LIMITS.md)), prompt
rendering, and the CLI (`validate`, `inspect`, `generate`, `run`, `serve`,
`chat`) are implemented. Model access supports both Anthropic and Amazon
Bedrock. Two HTTP API layers exist: a thin `agent_engine` API (`/invoke`,
`/stream`), started by `agentctl serve` (default port `8090`) — stateless, no
persistence, no web client — and `agent_manager` — a conversation lifecycle
service built on top of it with SQLite-backed persistence, SSE streaming, and
the official React web client, started by the separate `agent-manager`
console script (default port `8100`). `agentctl chat` is a separate, ephemeral
developer console that persists nothing (see `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §14 for
detail). Basic observability
(structured logging plus a Langfuse callback provider) is wired in. A
`Dockerfile`/`entrypoint.sh` provide a basic container image.

The access plugin **is** wired into child filtering, but the request-context
gate that should populate real identity/permissions into it is **not yet
implemented** — access filtering currently runs against an empty context, so
`protected` nodes are not actually enforced today. Treat this as an open
security gap, not a finished feature. See [docs/ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md)
for per-phase status. Agents implement the product task-by-task using the
files in `tasks/`, though the package layout has evolved beyond what the
original numbered tasks describe (see §4).

---

## 2. Core architecture pipeline

```
config.yml
  → validate          (schema + semantic validation)
  → compile           (typed internal models)
  → CompiledAgentGraph (immutable, built once)
  → RuntimeEngine     (long-lived, created at startup)
  → ExecutionContext  (created per request)
  → recursive agent execution
  → response + trace
```

Per-request flow:

```
Incoming request
  → Security/Context Gate
  → RuntimeEngine
  → filter protected nodes through access plugin
  → execute root as a supervisor agent (children exposed as tools)
  → resolve prompt variables through resolver plugins
  → render prompts
  → orchestrators synthesise; leaf agents execute their tools
  → call configured tools/MCP as needed
  → return response + trace
```

**Three separated phases (do not collapse them):** (1) **build/compile** —
load, validate, and compile YAML into a `CompiledAgentGraph` *before*
serving requests (never executes requests); (2) **runtime/execution** — per
request, create an `ExecutionContext`, filter protected nodes, route to a node
instance, render prompts, execute, call tools/MCP, return response + trace;
(3) **client extension** — client-specific auth/business logic lives in
plugins, never in the generic runtime.

---

## 3. Non-negotiable architecture rules

These rules are binding. Do not violate them, even if a task description seems
to ask for it. If a rule blocks you, stop and raise it.

1. **YAML is declarative specification, not executable business logic.**
2. **The runtime must never execute raw YAML dictionaries directly.**
3. **YAML must be validated first.**
4. **Validated YAML must be compiled into internal typed models** before use.
5. **RuntimeEngine is created once at application startup.** Never per request.
6. **ExecutionContext is created per request.** Never reused across requests.
7. **Do not store request state on RuntimeEngine** or on the compiled graph.
8. **Prompt files are templates.** They contain placeholders, not final text.
9. **Prompt templates may be cached.** Compiled/parsed templates are reusable.
10. **Prompt values are resolved dynamically per request.** Never cache a
    fully-rendered prompt globally.
11. **Client-specific auth, authorization, and business context are handled
    through plugins**, not baked into the generated runtime.
12. **Nodes declare what they need** (resolvers, tools, MCPs). **The runtime
    resolves and binds** those needs.
13. **Protected nodes must fail closed** through the fixed access plugin.
14. **Prompt text alone is not a security boundary.** Enforcement happens at the
    tool/data layer.
15. **Secrets must never be stored in YAML or prompt files.**
16. **Every meaningful behavior must have tests.**

The relevant design docs under `docs/` carry the rationale for these rules.
In particular, read [docs/PROMPT_RENDERING.md](docs/PROMPT_RENDERING.md) before
changing prompt rendering or resolver behavior; the runtime executes compiled
node *instances*, not raw declarations; and keep the build, runtime, and
client-extension phases separate (see
[docs/RUNTIME_LIFECYCLE.md](docs/RUNTIME_LIFECYCLE.md)).

## 4. Repository structure

`task 0001` originally planned a single `src/agentplatform/` package. That
layout was **not** what got built — the implementation split into two
packages instead, and `AGENTS.md`/`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` must track that
split, not the original plan:

```

    └── agentctl/              ← CLI: validate, inspect, generate, run, serve, chat
```

`agent_engine` never imports `agent_manager`; `agent_manager` only calls
`agent_engine` through the `Engine` / `RunResult` / `RunStreamEvent` ports —
this boundary is load-bearing (see §3 rule 11). There is
no separate `src/agentplatform/` package and no standalone `frontend/` app in
active use — the official React web client is served from
`src/agent_manager/api/static/widget/`.

## 5. AI Instruction System

The **canonical instruction system lives under [`.ai/`](.ai/)** — it is the
single source of truth for how AI agents (Claude Code, Codex, or any
future tool) work in this repo. **Before doing any work, read this file
(`AGENTS.md`) and [`.ai/README.md`](.ai/README.md).**

- [`.ai/skills/`](.ai/skills/) — reusable operational playbooks (how to do a
  kind of work well).
- [`.ai/roles/`](.ai/roles/) — reusable role definitions (architect,
  code-reviewer, test-engineer, documentation-writer).
- [`.ai/workflows/`](.ai/workflows/) — task workflows (feature-task, code-review,
  testing, documentation-update).

**Tool-specific folders (`.claude/`, `.codex/`, `.agents/`) must not
contain manually edited instruction content.** They hold tool configuration,
adapter READMEs, and generated adapters derived from `.ai/`. Generated adapters
may contain full skill, role, and workflow content for tool compatibility, but
`.ai/` remains the only editable source.

Always read [`.ai/skills/project-architecture.md`](.ai/skills/project-architecture.md)
first; then pick by the *kind* of task and the *area* of the system.

> **Rule: if a task touches multiple areas, read all relevant skills before
> editing.** (e.g. implementing the runtime in Python while adding tests →
> read the senior-python-engineering, runtime-engine, and testing skills.)

### Task → skill mapping (practice skills)

| Task type                         | Read this skill                                 |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Python implementation task        | `.ai/skills/senior-python-engineering.md`       |
| Test task                         | `.ai/skills/testing.md`                          |
| Code review task                  | `.ai/skills/code-review.md`                      |
| Architecture change               | `.ai/skills/architecture-review.md`              |
| Refactor                          | `.ai/skills/refactoring.md`                      |
| Documentation update              | `.ai/skills/documentation.md`                    |
| Git / change management           | `.ai/skills/git-workflow.md`                     |
| New skill creation                | `.ai/skills/skill-authoring.md`                  |
| Anything (always, first)          | `.ai/skills/project-architecture.md`             |

### Area → skill mapping (system-specific skills)

| If you are working on…                     | Read this skill                       |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| YAML schema, loading, validation           | `.ai/skills/yaml-schema.md`           |
| RuntimeEngine, ExecutionContext, lifecycle | `.ai/skills/runtime-engine.md`        |
| Prompt templates / rendering               | `.ai/skills/prompt-rendering.md`      |
| Plugin context/access resolution           | `.ai/skills/sidecar-auth-context.md`  |
| Tools, MCP servers, permissions            | `.ai/skills/mcp-tools.md`             |

Each skill ends with an **Expected Final Report** (or validation checklist) —
apply it before declaring work done.

## 6. How to choose the correct task file

`tasks/` contains small, ordered units of work. Tasks are intentionally narrow.

1. Work tasks **in numeric order** unless told otherwise; later tasks depend on
   earlier ones.
2. Open the task file and read **Goal, Scope, Files allowed to change, and Out
   of scope** before writing code.
3. **Do only what the task says.** If you discover work outside the task scope,
   note it and propose a new task — do not silently expand scope.

Current order: `0001` foundation → `0002` YAML schema → `0003` compiled graph →
`0004` runtime engine → `0005` prompts → `0006` plugin context/access → `0007` tools/MCP →
`0008` CLI → `0009` API → `0010` Docker → `0011` observability → `0012` tests
& quality gates.

---

## 7. How to make changes safely

- **Read first.** Read this file, the relevant skill, the relevant task, and the
  files you intend to change before editing.
- **Stay in scope.** Only edit files listed in the task's "Files allowed to
  change". If you must touch others, explain why.
- **Small, reviewable diffs.** Prefer many small, focused changes.
- **Do not delete or rewrite existing work** unless the task explicitly requires
  it and you can justify it.
- **No giant single-file implementations.** Follow the planned package layout.
- **No invented/fake features.** Do not stub something to look done. If it is
  not implemented, say so.
- **No secrets**, ever, in code, YAML, prompts, or fixtures.
- **No client-specific business logic** in the runtime — that belongs in
  client plugins.
- **Tests accompany behavior.** New meaningful behavior ships with tests.

---

## 8. Testing and validation commands

Run these from the repository root:

```bash
make install   # editable install (-e ".[dev]") with dev dependencies
make format     # auto-format the codebase (ruff format)
make lint       # lint (ruff check)
make typecheck  # type-check (mypy)
make test       # run the test suite (pytest)
make check      # lint + typecheck + test (the gate that must pass)
```

`make check` is the **mandatory gate** before declaring a task complete. If the
tooling is not installed yet for an early task, the task file says so and tells
you what to run instead.

---

## 9. Final response format after each task

When you finish a task, respond using exactly this structure:

1. **Summary** — what changed and why (2–5 sentences).
2. **Files changed** — list of created/modified/deleted files.
3. **Architecture rules respected** — confirm the relevant rules from §3.
4. **Commands run + results** — e.g. `make check` output (pass/fail).
5. **Acceptance criteria** — check each criterion from the task file.
6. **Out of scope / not done** — anything intentionally left.
7. **Recommended next task** — usually the next numbered task.
8. **Risks / notes** — anything a reviewer should know.

---

## 10. Rules against large uncontrolled rewrites

- **Never** perform a sweeping rewrite of a module to "clean it up" as a side
  effect of another task.
- **Never** reformat or move files outside your task's scope.
- **Never** change public contracts (YAML schema, plugin contracts, API shape)
  without a design note and explicit approval.
- If a change would touch many files or alter architecture, **stop and propose
  it as its own task** instead of doing it inline.
- When in doubt, do less and ask.

---

## Claude Code Integration

This repository is prepared for **Claude Code**. See
`docs/CLAUDE_CODE_WORKFLOW.md` for the full workflow.

- **`CLAUDE.md` is the project entrypoint** Claude Code reads first. It mirrors
  this manual's rules and points to `.ai/`; if the two ever disagree,
  **`AGENTS.md` wins**.
- **Skills, roles, and workflows are not edited under `.claude/`.**
  `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`, `.claude/agents/<name>.md`, and
  `.claude/workflows/<name>.md` contain **generated full-content adapters** —
  produced by `make generate-ai` from `.ai/`. Edit the canonical `.ai/` file, then
  regenerate. `.ai/` remains the single source of truth (see §5).
- **Role/persona definitions** (`architect`, `code-reviewer`, `test-engineer`,
  `documentation-writer`) live under [`.ai/roles/`](.ai/roles/), not in
  `.claude/agents/`.
- **Shared, conservative settings live in `.claude/settings.json`.**
  Local/private config (`CLAUDE.local.md`, `.claude/settings.local.json`) is
  git-ignored.

### Per-task rule

For each task, **select the relevant skill(s) before editing**. If a task spans
multiple areas, read all relevant skills first. In particular:

- Task touches **architecture** → use `.ai/skills/architecture-review.md`.
- Task touches **tests** → use `.ai/skills/testing.md`.
- Task touches **Python code** → use `.ai/skills/senior-python-engineering.md`.

The full task→skill and area→skill mappings are in §5 (AI Instruction System)
and in `CLAUDE.md`.
