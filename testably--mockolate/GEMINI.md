# Copilot Instructions for Mockolate

## Project Overview

Mockolate is a modern, strongly-typed mocking library for .NET, powered by source generators. It enables fast, compile-time validated mocks for interfaces and classes with full IntelliSense support.

**Key characteristics:**
- Source generator-based (no runtime proxy generation)
- Strongly-typed with compile-time safety
- AOT compatible (NativeAOT and trimming)
- Supports .NET Standard 2.0, .NET 8, .NET 10, and .NET Framework 4.8

## Architecture

The repository is organized into several key components:

### Source Projects
- **Mockolate**: Main library providing the mocking API
- **Mockolate.SourceGenerators**: Source generators that create mock implementations at compile time
- **Mockolate.Analyzers**: Roslyn analyzers for compile-time validation
- **Mockolate.Analyzers.CodeFixers**: Code fix providers for analyzer diagnostics

### Test Projects
- **Mockolate.Tests**: Core unit tests for the library
- **Mockolate.SourceGenerators.Tests**: Tests for source generators
- **Mockolate.Analyzers.Tests**: Tests for analyzers
- **Mockolate.Api.Tests**: API compatibility tests
- **Mockolate.ExampleTests**: Example usage tests
- **Aot/Mockolate.AotCompatibility.TestApp**: AOT compatibility validation

## Build System

The project uses **Nuke Build** for automation. Build scripts are available for all platforms:
- `build.sh` (Linux/macOS)
- `build.ps1` (Windows PowerShell)
- `build.cmd` (Windows Command Prompt)

### Common Build Targets
```bash
./build.sh                    # Default build
./build.sh CodeCoverage       # Build and run tests with coverage
./build.sh ApiChecks          # Run API compatibility tests
./build.sh CodeAnalysis       # Run SonarCloud analysis
./build.sh MutationTests      # Run Stryker mutation tests
./build.sh Benchmarks         # Run performance benchmarks
./build.sh Pack               # Create NuGet packages
```

### Building and Testing
```bash
# Quick build
dotnet build Mockolate.sln

# Run all tests
dotnet test Mockolate.sln

# Run specific test project
dotnet test Tests/Mockolate.Tests/Mockolate.Tests.csproj
```

## Coding Standards

### General Conventions
- Use **tabs** for indentation (tab width: 4)
- Follow `.editorconfig` settings strictly
- All code must be covered by unit tests
- Maintain > 90% code coverage
- Follow conventional commits for commit messages

### C# Conventions
- **DO NOT** use `var` - always use explicit types
- Use expression-bodied members for accessors, properties, methods, and lambdas
- Prefer pattern matching over `is` with cast or `as` with null check
- Use language keywords (`int`, `string`) over BCL types (`Int32`, `String`)
- Sort usings alphabetically with `System` namespaces first
- Do not use `this.` qualification

### Naming Conventions
- Use PascalCase for public members
- Use camelCase with leading underscore prefix for private fields (e.g., `_fieldName`)
- Use meaningful, descriptive names

### Testing Standards
- Use **xUnit** for all tests
- Test class names should end with `Tests` (e.g., `MockabilityAnalyzerTests`)
- Test method names should be descriptive using `When_Should` pattern or similar
- Use `[Fact]` for simple tests, `[Theory]` with `[InlineData]` for parameterized tests
- Arrange-Act-Assert pattern is preferred
- Each test should verify a single behavior

## Source Generator Development

When working on source generators:
- Source generators target .NET Standard 2.0
- Use incremental generators (`IIncrementalGenerator`) for performance
- Test source generators using the `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Testing` framework
- Ensure generated code compiles and passes all tests
- Generated code should be readable and follow the same coding standards

## Analyzer Development

When working on analyzers:
- Analyzers target .NET Standard 2.0
- Create corresponding code fixers when appropriate
- Write comprehensive tests for analyzers using `CSharpAnalyzerVerifier`
- Follow Roslyn analyzer guidelines
- Provide clear, actionable diagnostic messages

## API Surface

The library provides several key APIs:

### Mock Creation
- `Mock.Create<T>()` - Create mocks for interfaces or classes
- `Mock.Factory` - Create factory for shared behavior
- `BaseClass.WithConstructorParameters()` - For classes without default constructors

### Setup
- `mock.SetupMock.Method.*` - Configure method behavior
- `mock.SetupMock.Property.*` - Configure property behavior
- `mock.SetupMock.Indexer()` - Configure indexer behavior
- `mock.SetupMock.Delegate(...)` - Configure delegate behavior (for Action, Func, and custom delegates)

### Verification
- `mock.VerifyMock.Invoked.*` - Verify method calls
- `mock.VerifyMock.Invoked(...)` - Verify delegate invocations (for Action, Func, and custom delegates)
- `mock.VerifyMock.Got.*` - Verify property reads
- `mock.VerifyMock.Set.*` - Verify property writes
- `mock.VerifyMock.GotIndexer()` - Verify indexer reads
- `mock.VerifyMock.SetIndexer()` - Verify indexer writes

### Events
- `mock.RaiseOnMock.*` - Raise events on mocks
- `mock.VerifyMock.SubscribedTo.*` - Verify event subscriptions
- `mock.VerifyMock.UnsubscribedFrom.*` - Verify event unsubscriptions

## Quality Standards

### Static Code Analysis
- SonarCloud analysis must pass with no issues
- Quality gate requires:
  - All SonarCloud issues resolved
  - Code coverage > 90%
  - No code smells or vulnerabilities

### Mutation Testing
- Stryker mutation testing is run on main builds
- Aim for high mutation score to ensure test quality

### Multi-Platform Testing
- Tests run on Ubuntu, Windows, and macOS
- Ensure cross-platform compatibility
- Use platform-agnostic file paths and APIs

## Dependencies

- Use Central Package Management (Directory.Packages.props)
- All assemblies are strong-named
- Keep dependencies minimal
- Prefer Microsoft.* packages when available

## Common Tasks

### Adding a New Feature
1. Start with tests (TDD approach)
2. Implement in the appropriate project (Mockolate, SourceGenerators, or Analyzers)
3. Update documentation if API surface changes
4. Ensure all tests pass and coverage remains > 90%
5. Run full build with `./build.sh CodeCoverage`

### Fixing a Bug
1. Write a failing test that reproduces the bug
2. Fix the issue with minimal code changes
3. Verify the test passes
4. Check for similar issues elsewhere
5. Update related documentation if needed

### Adding Tests
- Tests must be in the appropriate test project
- Follow existing test patterns
- Use descriptive test names
- Ensure tests are deterministic and fast
- Mock external dependencies

## CI/CD

The project uses GitHub Actions with several workflows:

### build.yml (Main Build)
- Runs on pushes to main and tags
- Executes unit tests on Ubuntu, Windows, macOS
- Runs API tests
- Performs mutation testing
- Runs SonarCloud analysis
- Creates NuGet packages
- Publishes to NuGet on version tags

### ci.yml
- Runs on pull requests
- Quick validation build

### ci-analysis.yml
- Additional code quality checks

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Follow conventional commits format for PR titles
- Include clear description of changes
- All tests must pass
- Coverage must remain > 90%
- No SonarCloud issues
- Link related issues
- Update documentation for API changes

## Documentation

- README is the GitHub/NuGet landing page (pitch + quick start + links to docs); full reference docs live under `Docs/pages/` and are published to https://docs.testably.org/Mockolate/
- Keep `Docs/pages/` up to date with API changes; the README's link index should match the published structure
- Document public APIs with XML comments
- Examples should be in Mockolate.ExampleTests
- Follow existing documentation style

## Troubleshooting

### Source Generator Issues
- Clean and rebuild: `dotnet clean && dotnet build`
- Check generated files in `obj` directories
- Enable detailed logging with MSBuild verbosity

### Test Failures
- Run tests individually to isolate issues
- Check for platform-specific issues
- Verify test data and assumptions

### Build Issues
- Ensure correct .NET SDK version (10.0.100)
- Check global.json for SDK requirements
- Verify all NuGet packages are restored
