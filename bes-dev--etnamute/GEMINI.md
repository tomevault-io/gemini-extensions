**Version**: 1.0.0

## LANGUAGE

Detect the user's language from their first message. All communication — interview questions, summaries, confirmations, error messages — MUST be in that language. Pipeline files and code comments stay in English.

---

## PURPOSE

Etnamute transforms **raw app ideas** into **publishable mobile products**. Not demos. Not toys. Not half-products.

| In Scope                           | Out of Scope        |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| iOS + Android mobile apps          | Websites            |
| Expo React Native                  | Backend APIs        |
| RevenueCat monetization (optional) | User authentication |
| Offline-first / local storage      | Cloud databases     |

Monetization is **user's choice** — decided during the discovery interview. Free apps get zero monetization code.

---

## USER FLOW

```
USER: describes app idea
  ↓
PHASE 0: Discovery (INTERACTIVE)                                → /spec-app
  0a: Adaptive interview (5-8 questions via AskUserQuestion)
  0b: Web research (competitors, pricing, market)
  0c: PRD generation → user approves
  ↓
PHASE 1: Plan (AUTONOMOUS)                                       → /build-app
  9-section implementation plan (template: pipeline/plan.md)
  ↓
PHASE 2: Build (AUTONOMOUS, milestone-driven)                    → /build-app
  M1: Scaffold → M2: Screens → M3: Features
  M4: Monetization (skip if free) → M5: Polish
  QA after each milestone (pipeline/qa.md)
  ↓
PHASE 3: Finalization
  Final QA → FINAL_VERDICT.md
  ↓
BUILD COMPLETE
  ↓ (user iterates with /improve-app until satisfied)
  ↓
/market-app → ASO + research + marketing materials
  ↓
/release-app → build + screenshots + submit to stores
```

**Improve Mode**: user requests changes to an existing app → `/improve-app`
**Headless Mode**: build from a pre-written PRD without interview → `/headless`

### Output Contract

Every app in `apps/<slug>/` MUST have:
- `package.json`, `app.config.js`, `tsconfig.json`
- `app/` with `_layout.tsx`, `index.tsx`, `home.tsx`, `settings.tsx`
- `app/paywall.tsx` + `src/services/purchases.ts` — only if monetization enabled
- `assets/icon.png` (1024x1024), `assets/splash.png`
- `aso/`, `research/`, `marketing/` — generated via `/market-app` after code is finalized
- `README.md`, `RUNBOOK.md`, `TESTING.md`, `LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md`, `privacy_policy.md`

---

## MODES

| Mode | Trigger | Behavior |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Discovery** | User describes an app | Interactive interview → research → PRD approval |
| **Build** | User approves PRD | Autonomous: plan → milestones → QA. No stops, no questions. |
| **QA (Ralph)** | After each milestone | Adversarial review from PRD. Fix until ≥97%. Max 3 iterations. |
| **Improve** | User requests change to existing app | Read PRD + code → clarify → apply → verify |
| **Headless** | User provides a PRD file path | Validate PRD → plan → build → QA. No interview. |
| **Release** | User asks to deploy | Fastlane config → Maestro screenshots → build → submit |

```
Discovery ──[PRD approved]──▶ Build ──[milestone]──▶ QA ──[≥97%]──▶ Build (next)
Headless  ──[PRD validated]──▶ Build (same as above)
Build ──[all milestones + final QA]──▶ Complete ──[user request]──▶ Release
Improve ──[changes + verify]──▶ Done ──[more changes]──▶ Improve (loop)
```

---

## PHASE DETAILS

### Phase 0: Discovery → `/spec-app`

Interview → research → PRD generation → user approval.

### Phase 1-2: Plan + Build → `/build-app`

Plan (9 sections via `pipeline/plan.md`) → 5 milestones → QA after each (`pipeline/qa.md`).

| Milestone | Deliverables | Tests |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| M1: Scaffold | versions, package.json, NativeWind, jest setup | — |
| M2: Screens | navigation, core UI | screen render tests |
| M3: Features | core functionality, data | store + util + persistence tests |
| M4: Monetization | RevenueCat, paywall — **skip if free** | paywall mock tests |
| M5: Polish | onboarding, assets, docs | onboarding + settings tests |

### Phase 3: Finalization

Final QA → `apps/<slug>/ralph/FINAL_VERDICT.md` → BUILD COMPLETE.

### Phase 4: Release → `/release-app`

Pre-flight → fastlane config → screenshots → build → submit.

## GUARDRAILS

Claude MUST:
- Run discovery interview before building
- Perform web research before generating PRD
- Get explicit user approval on PRD before Phase 1
- Resolve dependency versions from `npx create-expo-app@latest` during M1 (never hardcode)
- Fetch API docs via mcpdoc before using ANY Expo module, NativeWind, Reanimated, or RevenueCat
- Run Ralph QA after every milestone (≥97%)
- Respect user's monetization choice

Claude MUST NOT:
- Skip the interview or web research
- Start building without PRD approval
- Stop or ask questions during build (Phase 1+)
- Add monetization to a free app
- Hallucinate market data without web search
- Use `--legacy-peer-deps`, `--force`, or `--ignore-engines`
- Write outside `apps/`

---

## TECHNOLOGY STACK

Core choices (do NOT change):
- **Expo** (latest stable SDK) with **Expo Router**
- **NativeWind** for styling
- **React Native Reanimated** for animations
- **RevenueCat** for monetization (if enabled)
- **expo-sqlite** + **AsyncStorage** for data
- **Zustand** for state management
- **TypeScript**

**CRITICAL: Do NOT hardcode SDK versions.** During M1 (Scaffold), run:
```bash
npx create-expo-app@latest --template blank-typescript /tmp/expo-version-check
```
Extract exact compatible versions from its `package.json`, then delete it. Use those versions as the baseline for the app. This ensures all dependencies are compatible with the current Expo SDK.

**NativeWind setup requires** (fetch docs via mcpdoc for current instructions):
- `metro.config.js` with `withNativeWind` wrapper
- `babel.config.js` with `nativewind/babel` preset
- `global.css` imported in root layout

**Expo Go compatibility**: apps MUST work in Expo Go (`npx expo start`). Do NOT use packages that require native builds, TurboModules, or New Architecture. Only Expo SDK packages (`expo-*`) and pure JS packages. Install via `npx expo install`, not `npm install`. See `.claude/rules/app-patterns.md` for the full rule and known incompatible packages.

**Peer dependency conflicts**: use `"overrides"` in package.json to pin conflicting transitive deps. This is preferred over `--legacy-peer-deps` (which is forbidden).

---

## API DOCUMENTATION

**MANDATORY**: Before writing ANY code that uses an Expo module or RevenueCat, fetch its documentation via `mcpdoc`. APIs change between SDK versions — your training data is likely outdated.

Fetch docs for:
- Every Expo SDK module before first use (expo-sqlite, expo-file-system, expo-notifications, etc.)
- Expo Router before setting up navigation
- NativeWind before configuring styling
- RevenueCat before implementing monetization
- React Native Reanimated before writing animations

Available via mcpdoc (`.mcp.json`):
- **Expo** (docs.expo.dev)
- **RevenueCat** (revenuecat.com/docs)

**Do NOT rely on memory for API signatures, config patterns, or import paths.** They change between versions. Always fetch.

## DEFAULTS

| Aspect         | Default                                  |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Platform       | iOS + Android (Expo)                     |
| Monetization   | Ask user (no default forced)             |
| Data storage   | Local-only, offline-first (SQLite)       |
| Backend        | None                                     |
| Authentication | Guest-first (no login)                   |

---

## BUILD VERIFICATION

Follow `pipeline/qa.md`. Three mandatory levels after EVERY milestone:

1. **Build**: `npm install` + `npx tsc --noEmit` + `npx expo export` (bundle check)
2. **Tests**: write and run Jest tests for stores, utils, screen renders
3. **Runtime**: Maestro smoke test (if available) or Metro start verification

ALL three must pass before proceeding.

**CRITICAL**: `npx expo export` catches bundle errors but NOT runtime errors. APIs that bundle correctly can still crash at runtime (e.g., changed SDK APIs). Level 3 (actually running the app on simulator and checking logs for errors) is MANDATORY, not optional. Do NOT declare BUILD COMPLETE until the app runs on simulator without runtime errors.

---

## COMPLETION

When build is complete, write to `apps/<slug>/ralph/FINAL_VERDICT.md`:

```
PIPELINE: etnamute v1.0.0
OUTPUT: apps/<slug>/
RALPH_VERDICT: PASS (≥97%)
TIMESTAMP: <ISO-8601>

VERIFIED:
- [ ] Discovery interview conducted
- [ ] Web research performed
- [ ] PRD approved by user
- [ ] All milestones complete
- [ ] Ralph PASS achieved
- [ ] npm install succeeds
- [ ] npx expo start works
- [ ] RevenueCat integrated (if monetization enabled)
- [ ] All code deliverables present (research/ASO/marketing generated separately via /market-app)
```

Then output:
```
BUILD COMPLETE

App: <app-name>
Location: apps/<slug>/

To run:
  cd apps/<slug>
  npm install
  npx expo start
```

---

## ERROR RECOVERY

| Error | Recovery |
|-------|----------|
| WebSearch unavailable | Mark PRD sections `[UNVALIDATED]`, inform user |
| Ralph fails after 3 iterations | Document blockers, inform user |
| npm install / expo start fails | Fix root cause, retry |
| User abandons interview | Resume from last answered question |

### Drift Detection

Halt and reassess if:
- About to write outside `apps/`
- About to add monetization to a free app
- About to skip interview or research
- Quality stays below 97% after 3 Ralph iterations

---

## APPLE APP STORE COMPLIANCE

Run `scripts/greenlight.sh apps/<slug>/` after build verification.

CRITICAL and HIGH findings must be fixed before shipping.
