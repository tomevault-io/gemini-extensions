# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Rails 8.1 API application that serves as the backend for NativeAppTemplate iOS/Android mobile applications. It's a multi-tenant SaaS application with token-based authentication, role-based authorization, and RESTful API endpoints. Ruby 4.0.2, PostgreSQL, Solid Queue/Cable/Cache.

## Development Commands

### Initial Setup
```bash
bin/setup  # Installs all dependencies, prepares database, builds assets
```

### Running the Application
```bash
bin/dev  # Starts Rails server, CSS watcher, JS bundler
```

### Testing
```bash
bin/rails test                  # Run all tests
bin/rails test test/path/to/test.rb  # Run specific test file
bin/rails test test/path/to/test.rb:42  # Run specific test line
```

### Linting & Security
```bash
bin/rubocop                     # Ruby code linting
bundle exec erb_lint --lint-all # ERB template linting
bin/brakeman                    # Security vulnerability scanning
bin/bundler-audit               # Audit gems for known security defects
```

### Local CI
```bash
bin/ci  # Runs setup, rubocop, bundler-audit, brakeman, tests, and seeds
```

### Database Operations
```bash
bin/rails db:create db:migrate  # Create and migrate database
bin/rails db:seed_fu           # Load seed data (uses seed-fu gem)
bin/rails db:reset             # Drop, create, migrate, and seed
```

### Console & Debugging
```bash
bin/rails console              # Rails console
bin/rails dbconsole           # Database console
```

## Architecture & Key Concepts

### API Structure
- All API endpoints are under `/api/v1/` namespace
- Token-based authentication using `devise_token_auth`
- Separate namespaces for different user types (e.g., `/api/v1/shopkeeper/`)
- JSON API specification for responses using `jsonapi-serializer`
- CORS enabled for cross-origin requests

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Authentication**: Devise Token Auth with headers-based token management
- **Authorization**: Pundit policies for resource-level permissions
- **Multi-tenancy**: acts_as_tenant for complete data isolation between accounts
- **RBAC**: Role and Permission models for fine-grained access control

### Key Models & Relationships
- `Account` - Top-level tenant/organization
- `Shopkeeper` - Main user type (belongs to Account)
- `Shop` - Core business entity (belongs to Account)
- `ItemTag` - Belongs to Shop; has name/description/position and a binary state (idled/completed)
- `Role` & `Permission` - Authorization system
- State machines implemented with AASM gem

### Background Processing
- Solid Queue for background jobs (database-backed, no Redis needed)
- Solid Cable for Action Cable (database-backed)
- Solid Cache for caching in production/staging
- Monitor jobs at `/madmin/jobs` (Mission Control)

### Push Notifications
Cross-platform push via the `noticed` (v3) and `action_push_native` gems. APNs for iOS, FCM for Android.

- **Provider names, not OS names**: the device `platform` is `apple` (APNs) or `google` (FCM) — never `ios`/`android`. The enum (`validate: true`) rejects anything else with 422 "Platform is not included in the list".
- **Models**: `ApplicationPushDevice < ActionPushNative::Device` (`action_push_native_devices` table; polymorphic `owner`, unique on `[platform, token]`). `ApplicationPushNotification < ActionPushNative::Notification`. Delivery records live in `noticed_events` / `noticed_notifications`. All visible in `/madmin`.
- **Device registration**: `POST /api/v1/shopkeeper/devices` is idempotent on `(platform, token)` — re-POST updates `last_active_at`; a token bound to another shopkeeper is reassigned.
- **Notifiers**: subclass `ApplicationNotifier` (`Noticed::Event`). `ItemTagNotifier` fires from the AASM `complete` event. In `deliver_by :action_push_native`, the `with_apple`, `with_google`, and `with_data` options must each return a **Hash** (use `{}` when empty) — passing `nil` raises `TypeError: no implicit conversion of nil into Hash`.
- **Config & secrets**: `config/push.yml` reads everything from credentials (`bin/rails credentials:edit --environment <env>`) under `action_push_native:apns:{key_id, team_id, topic, encryption_key}` and `action_push_native:fcm:{project_id, encryption_key}`. APNs `encryption_key` is the full `.p8` PEM; FCM `encryption_key` is the entire service-account JSON. `topic` stays in credentials (not source) because the agent's rename pipeline would otherwise desync the bundle id.
- **APNs sandbox vs production**: `connect_to_development_server: <%= Rails.env.development? %>`. The token's environment is fixed at iOS build time — Xcode debug builds get **sandbox** tokens, TestFlight/App Store get **production**. They must match the server: test Xcode debug builds against a **local development** server; use TestFlight to test against Render. A mismatch returns APNs `400 BadDeviceToken`, which the gem treats as `TokenError` and **destroys the device row** (the default `rescue_from`). FCM has no such split.

### Testing Strategy
- Minitest for all tests (models, controllers, integration, policies)
- WebMock for stubbing external HTTP requests
- Parallel test execution supported (10 workers by default)
- Comprehensive test coverage across all layers:
  - **Model tests**: test/models/ - Validations, associations, callbacks, state machines
  - **Policy tests**: test/policies/ - Authorization rules for all user roles
  - **Controller tests**: test/controllers/ - API endpoints, authentication, authorization
  - **Integration tests**: test/integration/ - End-to-end user flows
- Test helpers:
  - `json_response` for parsing JSON API responses
  - `create_new_auth_token` for generating auth headers (Devise Token Auth)
  - Fixtures in test/fixtures/ and seed data in db/fixtures/test/
- Run tests: `bin/rails test` (205 tests, 402 assertions)

### Development Server Configuration
- `HOST` (Wi-Fi IP) and `PORT` are required in `.env`; `Procfile.dev` uses `${HOST:?...}` so Rails fails loudly if unset, and `development.rb` uses `ENV.fetch("HOST")` for `action_mailer.default_url_options`. Must match `NATIVEAPPTEMPLATE_API_DOMAIN` in the iOS scheme and Android `gradle.properties`. Never `127.0.0.1`, `localhost`, or `0.0.0.0`.
- Mailbin for email testing at `/mailbin`
- Admin interface at `/madmin`
- Tailwind CSS compiled by tailwindcss-rails gem

### Important Conventions
- Use `seed-fu` for database seeding (not standard Rails seeds)
- API responses follow JSON API specification
- All API controllers inherit from `Api::V1::BaseController`
- Tenant isolation handled automatically via `AccountMiddleware`
- Image processing with Active Storage and `image_processing` gem

### Deployment
- Configured for Render.com deployment
- Build script: `bin/render-build.sh`
- Web server: `bin/render-start.sh`
- Solid Queue runs in Puma via `SOLID_QUEUE_IN_PUMA=true`

## Code Quality Checks Before Committing

**IMPORTANT**: Always run these checks and fix all errors before committing code:

### 1. Lint Errors (RuboCop)
```bash
bin/rubocop
```
- Fix all RuboCop offenses before committing
- Run `bin/rubocop -a` to auto-correct safe offenses
- Review and manually fix remaining issues

### 2. Security Scan (Brakeman)
```bash
bin/brakeman
```
- Fix all security vulnerabilities before committing
- Review warnings and address potential security issues
- Never commit code with security vulnerabilities

### 3. Run Tests
```bash
bin/rails test
```
- Ensure all tests pass before committing
- Add tests for new features or bug fixes

### Pre-Commit Checklist
- [ ] `bin/rubocop` - No lint errors
- [ ] `bin/brakeman` - No security issues
- [ ] `bin/rails test` - All tests passing
- [ ] Code reviewed for quality and security

## Common Development Tasks

### Creating New API Endpoints
1. Add route in `config/routes.rb` under appropriate namespace
2. Create controller inheriting from `Api::V1::BaseController`
3. Add Pundit policy in `app/policies/` with authorization rules
4. Create serializer in `app/serializers/`
5. Write controller tests in `test/controllers/` testing all actions and edge cases

### Writing Tests
- **Model tests**: Test validations, associations, callbacks, scopes, and business logic
- **Policy tests**: Test authorization for all roles (admin, managers, members, guest)
- **Controller tests**: Test CRUD operations, authentication requirements, authorization checks
- Use `ActsAsTenant.with_tenant(@account)` when testing multi-tenant models
- Fixtures are loaded automatically from test/fixtures/*.yml
- Test data seeds loaded from db/fixtures/test/*.rb in setup hook

### Working with Multi-tenancy
- All models should include `acts_as_tenant :account`
- Current account accessible via `current_account` in controllers
- Tenant switching handled by `AccountMiddleware`

### Adding Background Jobs
1. Create job class in `app/jobs/`
2. Specify queue with `queue_as :default` (or :critical, :low, etc.)
3. Call with `MyJob.perform_later(args)`

## Testing Policy

Create test passing all of path including unhappy path. Creating and updating that test is must.
