Last updated: 2026-08-31 for the 1.2.0 release.

Project instructions for haze coding agents. Keep this root file concise; read nested `AGENTS.md` files in the subtree you touch for precise contracts.

Last analysis: 2026-08-15.

## Project overview

haze is a Node >=22 TypeScript ESM CLI package (`@denizokcu/haze`) for terminal-based agentic app building.

Core shape:

- React + Ink interactive terminal chat UI, themed through a built-in palette registry (`/themes`).
- Vercel AI SDK with OpenAI-compatible providers.
- Local tools for file discovery/read/search/edit/write, public URL fetch, foreground and managed background processes, LSP/MCP integration, global/project skills, image attachments, subagents/fleet, task tracking, session browsing/forking, and compaction.
- Source lives in `src/`; generated `dist/` must not be edited.

Verify current package version in `package.json` before release work.

## Common commands

```bash
npm install
npm ci                 # preferred in CI or clean checkouts
npm run dev            # run CLI via tsx
npm run haze           # alias for dev
npm start              # run built dist CLI

npm run typecheck      # tsc --noEmit
npm test               # vitest run
npm run lint           # eslint src/
npm run context:report # estimated prompt/tool/context token breakdown

npm run build          # clean + tsc
npm pack --dry-run     # inspect published tarball
```

Before release/PR confidence: `npm run typecheck && npm test && npm run lint && npm run build`.

## Repository map

- `src/` — TypeScript/TSX source. See nested `src/**/AGENTS.md` files.
- `tests/` — Vitest suite. See `tests/AGENTS.md`.
- `bin/haze.js` — thin npm binary shim to built CLI.
- `dist/` — generated build output; never edit directly.
- `docs/*.html` — static docs pages in repo (`index.html` plus topic pages like `commands.html`, `tools.html`).

## Global coding conventions

- Strict TypeScript, ESM (`type: "module"`), NodeNext module resolution, ES2022 target.
- Local TypeScript imports use `.js` extensions.
- Prefer plain TypeScript for core logic; keep React/Ink in CLI/UI layers.
- Use Zod for AI SDK tool schemas and generated-object schemas.
- YAML parsing/writing uses the `yaml` package.
- Avoid `any`; prefer `unknown`, type guards, or existing result types.
- Preserve local formatting style; avoid broad formatting churn.
- ESLint: unused vars are errors unless args start with `_`; `no-explicit-any` is an error.

## Editing rules

- Check `git status --short` before large work; do not overwrite unrelated user edits.
- Never edit `dist/`, `node_modules/`, `.git/`, generated outputs, secrets, or ignored runtime state.
- Do not edit `package-lock.json` unless dependency changes require it.
- Prefer targeted edits over whole-file rewrites for source.
- Do not commit, tag, publish, reset, delete, force-push, or run destructive cleanups unless explicitly requested.

## Runtime contracts to preserve

Recent decisions to preserve:

- Runtime support floor is Node >=22. Keep docs, package metadata, and generated docs aligned.
- Provider/model selection is explicit: do not silently fall back to the first configured provider/model.
- Settings parsing should fail loudly for malformed files and preserve unrelated/unknown fields when patching.

- No default provider/model. Users configure providers via `/provider`; no user-facing env vars for provider/model settings.
- The provider surface stays OpenAI-compatible (plus the `chatgpt-codex` OAuth kind) for now; frontier models are reached through gateways (OpenRouter, Gemini's official OpenAI endpoint). Do not add native provider adapters without an explicit decision change — the `kind` union on `HazeProviderSettings` is the extension point.
- File tools are confined to `process.cwd()`, respect `.gitignore` by default, and skip `.git`/`node_modules` walking; user-typed `@path` mentions and bare paths containing `/` are the exception and may bless host paths outside it for read-only tools (readFile, grep, listFiles). Mutating tools never honour the bless set. URL safety fails closed for malformed IPv6-shaped literals.
- Secret files are hands-off for the file tools, always: SSH keys (`~/.ssh/**`, `id_*` private keys), shell history files, `.env`/`.envrc` (except `.example`/`.sample`/`.template` doc variants), `*.pem`/`*.key`, and common home credential stores (`core/safety/secretPaths.ts`). Reads and mutations are refused before any filesystem access with a terminal structured result (reason code `secret_file_protected`, `recoverable: false`, ask-the-user next step, no content echoed), the check covers lexical and real paths so symlinks cannot rename secrets into reach, and it overrides the bless set and `allowIgnored`; grep traversal excludes the names with negated-only globs appended after any model glob. The UI summarizes these as `blocked: protected secret file (path)`, distinct from ordinary failures. The shell tool is deliberately not hard-filtered; shell-side secret avoidance is instructed via the system prompt (`SECRET_FILE_RULE`), so the prompt rule and the file-tool refusal must stay aligned when either changes.
- Output is aggressively bounded/reduced but raw large outputs may be retrievable by handle. Exact line paging uses bounded, signature-validated sparse indexes; subprocess teardown must not hang when escaped descendants retain stdio pipes; ignore rules are evaluated in-process from the repository/worktree boundary without requiring Git (reads fail open, mutation guards fail closed).
- Failed file mutations activate read-only recovery only when their structured result explicitly requests `readFile`. Recovery state advances in the AI SDK's ordered `onStepEnd` callback, compares lexical workspace path identity (`a.ts` and `./a.ts` are equivalent), and repeated-tool suppression applies only to the immediately following step.
- Abort causes are distinguished (user / turn deadline / model-stream idle stall). An idle stall with no emitted step output retries via the shared bounded model-retry pool (sized by the `modelRetries` setting, default 2, range 0–10; backoff base via `retryBaseDelayMs`, default 1000ms; reported as `maxRetries` in events), salvaging the conversation to the last completed step; the pool resets whenever a failed attempt completed steps since the previous retry, and an exhausted stall pauses the turn (status `failed`) preserving the active goal and exposing a one-key R resume interactively. Provider context-overflow errors recover through bounded compact-and-retry attempts with a progressively shrunk message budget (0.6 → 0.36), after which the goal checkpoints (`context_exhausted`) instead of hard-failing; silent and length-stop overflows are detected from provider usage through the classification table in `core/agent/overflow.ts`, and context estimation prefers provider usage via the turn-scoped usage anchor. Mid-turn compaction at epoch boundaries uses an LLM-written summary (iterative, split-turn aware) for large older halves and the heuristic excerpt otherwise. An attempt that ignores cancellation past a grace window is forcibly settled at turn level: owned resources close exactly once (bounded), the attempt's callbacks are permanently quarantined so late output cannot mutate the finished turn, and the turn resolves `aborted` with a truthful teardown report.
- Completion is evidence-gated, not text-gated: a voluntary final is rejected while this turn's `writeTasks` list has pending/in-progress items or post-mutation validation is missing/stale/failed (implement/fix/test intents). Red→green is opportunistic: a fix need not capture a pre-edit failure, but if a recognized validation does fail before the first mutation, that same command must pass after the fix. Known test/build commands count automatically; custom checks use `shell` with `purpose=validation` so real process results become structured evidence. — with authority rules: validation-classified commands run under `pipefail` (POSIX), a passing validation whose unquoted command can mask a failing stage (`;`/`||`/`&` compounds) is demoted to unconfirmed (`generic`), validation-kind inference matches only the unquoted command shape, and a passing generic validation never clears a failed classifier-confirmed one (eval-hardened through model-backed adversarial evals). Rejected finals trigger autonomous goal continuation inside the same logical turn and budgets; a logical-goal supervisor (`runAgentGoal`) spans physical turns, so a step/tool budget boundary (including `tool-calls` finishes) automatically starts a fresh continuation turn against the preserved conversation while measurable progress continues and the goal deadline remains. Inside each attempt, every `ToolLoopAgent` instance is one completed SDK step wide: exact provider messages append into the next instance so prompt-cache prefixes survive routine resource rollover, while SDK result/step graphs become collectible. Active provider history is never tool-slimmed routinely; session persistence slims its own copy, and only true context-budget compaction may rewrite the provider prefix. Every supervisor boundary appends to a durable goal ledger in the session JSONL (crash-safe frontier; resumable on session resume), and headless `--until-done` relaunches transient model failures against it with a no-progress poison guard. It stops only for structured completion, hard blockers, user cancellation, the goal deadline, context exhaustion (`context_exhausted` — the supervisor pauses with the resumable checkpoint instead of relaunching the same oversized request), or one corrective physical turn without measurable outcome progress — never reporting incomplete work as `complete`. Old workspace task files never block unrelated turns; carried evidence hydrates continuation turns via seq baselines so validation debt survives the boundary.
- Session state is JSONL under `~/.haze/sessions`; new sessions stay memory-only until the first resumable message, empty legacy files stay out of resume/latest listings, persisted sessions skip streaming `message_update` spam and slim large tool outputs, and file LLM logging under `~/.haze/logs` is enabled only by `--debug`.
- The Ink transcript is append-only static output above a dynamic tail. Streamed assistant Markdown may move into static output only after a root block is stable; the final root remains plain and dynamic until another root begins or the response finishes. The dynamic tail (streaming roots, live tool groups, task bar) is clamped to a viewport-derived row budget so Ink never enters its scrollback-wiping overflow path; row estimates mirror Ink's own `wrap-ansi` wrapping.
- Context files: global `~/.haze/AGENTS.md` wins over `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`; ancestor `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md` load at startup; nested subtree files load lazily when tools touch that subtree and are reread when their signature changes.
- Skills are Markdown instruction packages under global `~/.haze/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` or project `<workspace>/.haze/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`; they do not execute code. Project skills are untrusted repo content, real-path-confined to the workspace, visibly labeled, and take precedence over same-named global skills unless the project scope is disabled.
- Themes are a settings-name-keyed registry: every built-in theme is one data entry in `src/ui/themes/registry.ts` (keyed by settings name; `purple` is the base/default spec), `resolveTheme` validates names loudly and `tests/ui/theme.test.ts` pins the registry keys and completeness. `theme` in settings selects the palette; `/themes` (picker or `/themes <name>`) switches it live — ChatScreen re-resolves on settings change. A theme owns both terminal defaults: OSC 10/11 are adopted at startup and restored on exit (`src/ui/terminalColors.ts`); already-rendered `<Static>` transcript keeps its old colors by design.

## Testing expectations

Run validation appropriate to the change:

- General source: `npm run typecheck`, `npm test`, `npm run lint`.
- Build/package: also `npm run build` and `npm pack --dry-run`.
- Tool behavior: targeted `tests/hazeTools/*` plus relevant formatter tests.
- Validation parser: `tests/core/validationParser.test.ts`.
- Skills: `tests/skills/*` and example skills if public contract changes.

If validation is skipped, state why in the final response.

## Spec-Kit

This repository uses the [spec-kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit) workflow for AI-assisted feature development.
Spec-kit is a convention for structuring feature specs, plans, and tasks in a `.specify/` directory so that AI agents can read and act on them.
This project uses an opinionated local tooling layer to generate the artifacts that live there — the source of truth for the workflow itself is the spec-kit repo linked above.

### `.specify/` directory

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.specify/templates/` | Markdown templates for specs, plans, tasks, and checklists |
| `.specify/memory/` | Long-lived context files (e.g. `constitution.md`) read by agents |
| `.specify/scripts/` | Helper shell scripts for common workflow steps |
| `.specify/hooks.yml` | CI/automation hook definitions |

### How to use it

- Start a new feature: `/speckit-specify` — creates a spec from a template and opens a clarification loop.
- Generate a plan: `/speckit-plan` — converts an approved spec into a structured plan.
- Break into tasks: `/speckit-tasks` — decomposes a plan into trackable tasks.
- Implement: `/speckit-implement` — works through tasks and updates checklists.
