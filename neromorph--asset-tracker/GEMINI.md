### 2.2 State Management

- Use **Riverpod 2.x** (`flutter_riverpod`, `riverpod_annotation`) exclusively.
- No `setState` outside of purely local, ephemeral UI state (e.g., a text field focus).
- All providers must be typed. Never use `dynamic` or `Object` as provider return types.
- Use `AsyncNotifier` for async operations; `Notifier` for synchronous state.
- Keep providers in `presentation/providers/` colocated with the feature they serve.

### 2.3 Repository Pattern

- Every data operation goes through a repository interface in `domain/repositories/`.
- Concrete implementations live in `data/repositories/`.
- Use cases (`domain/usecases/`) call repositories only — never Supabase directly.
- Presentation layer calls use cases only — never repositories directly.
- This layering is non-negotiable. Do not shortcut it even for simple reads.

### 2.4 Offline-First

- Local SQLite (via **Drift**) is the single source of truth for the UI.
- All reads come from local DB. All writes go to local DB first, then sync to Supabase.
- Sync is eventual — the app must be fully functional with no internet connection.
- Mark records with `sync_status`: `synced | pending_create | pending_update | pending_delete`.
- Sync service runs on app foreground and on connectivity restore.

## 3. Security Rules — Non-Negotiable

### 3.1 Secrets and Credentials

- **Never hardcode** Supabase URL, anon key, or any secret in Dart source files.
- Store secrets in `--dart-define` at build time or in a `.env` file loaded via `flutter_dotenv`.
- `.env` must be in `.gitignore`. Commit a `.env.example` with placeholder values only.
- Never log secrets, tokens, or user PII to the console — not even in debug mode.

```dart
// CORRECT
final supabaseUrl = const String.fromEnvironment('SUPABASE_URL');
final supabaseAnonKey = const String.fromEnvironment('SUPABASE_ANON_KEY');

// WRONG — never do this
final supabaseUrl = 'https://xxxx.supabase.co';
```

### 3.2 Supabase Row Level Security (RLS)

- Every Supabase table MUST have RLS enabled. No exceptions.
- Default policy: deny all. Only grant what is explicitly needed.
- Every user can only access rows where `owner_id = auth.uid()` OR where they belong to the same `family_group_id`.
- Write migration SQL for every policy alongside the table creation migration.
- Never disable RLS even temporarily for debugging — use the Supabase dashboard to inspect data instead.

```sql
-- Example RLS policy pattern
alter table assets enable row level security;

create policy "Users can view their own family assets"
  on assets for select
  using (
    owner_id = auth.uid()
    or family_group_id in (
      select family_group_id from users where id = auth.uid()
    )
  );
```

### 3.3 Authentication

- Use Supabase Auth exclusively. No custom auth logic.
- Support email/password and Google OAuth.
- On logout: clear local DB sensitive data, invalidate all Riverpod providers, navigate to login.
- Session tokens are managed by the Supabase Flutter client — do not store them manually.
- Use `supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange` stream to reactively handle session changes.

### 3.4 Local Storage Security

- Use **flutter_secure_storage** for any sensitive data that must persist locally (refresh tokens, encryption keys).
- Never use `SharedPreferences` for sensitive values.
- Local Drift database should be encrypted using `sqlcipher_flutter_libs` if storing document metadata.
- Document files (PDFs, images) stored on-device must go in the app's private documents directory, not external storage.

### 3.5 File and Document Security

- Files uploaded to Supabase Storage must go into a private bucket (not public).
- Generate signed URLs with short expiry (max 1 hour) for display/download — never expose permanent public URLs.
- Validate file type and size before upload: max 10 MB per file, allow only `pdf`, `jpg`, `jpeg`, `png`, `heic`.
- Strip EXIF metadata from images before upload using `flutter_exif_rotation` or equivalent.

### 3.6 Input Validation

- Validate all user input on the client before any DB write.
- Validate again via Supabase database constraints and RLS (defense in depth).
- Sanitize text fields — trim whitespace, enforce max lengths matching DB column constraints.
- Never construct SQL strings manually. Always use parameterized queries via the Supabase client.

### 3.7 Biometric Lock

- Implement app-level biometric lock using `local_auth`.
- Lock the app after 5 minutes of backgrounding.
- Biometric prompt must appear on app resume before any data is visible.
- Store the lock preference in `flutter_secure_storage`.

## 4. Code Quality Rules

### 4.1 Dart Style

- Follow the official [Dart style guide](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/style).
- Run `dart analyze` and `dart format` before every commit. Zero warnings permitted.
- Enable strict analysis in `analysis_options.yaml`:

```yaml
analyzer:
  strong-mode:
    implicit-casts: false
    implicit-dynamic: false
  errors:
    missing_required_param: error
    missing_return: error
    todo: warning
linter:
  rules:
    - always_declare_return_types
    - avoid_dynamic_calls
    - avoid_print
    - avoid_slow_async_io
    - cancel_subscriptions
    - close_sinks
    - prefer_const_constructors
    - prefer_final_locals
    - unawaited_futures
```

### 4.2 Naming Conventions

| Item | Convention | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Classes | `UpperCamelCase` | `AssetRepository` |
| Files | `snake_case` | `asset_repository.dart` |
| Variables | `lowerCamelCase` | `expiryDate` |
| Constants | `lowerCamelCase` with `const` | `const defaultReminderDays = 30` |
| Private | Prefix with `_` | `_syncStatus` |
| Riverpod providers | Suffix with `Provider` | `assetListProvider` |

### 4.3 Error Handling

- Never use bare `catch (e)` without handling or rethrowing.
- Use a typed `AppException` sealed class for domain errors:

```dart
sealed class AppException {
  const AppException();
}

class NetworkException extends AppException {
  final String message;
  const NetworkException(this.message);
}

class AuthException extends AppException {
  final String message;
  const AuthException(this.message);
}

class StorageException extends AppException {
  final String message;
  const StorageException(this.message);
}
```

- All repository methods return `Either<AppException, T>` using `fpdart` or wrap in `AsyncValue`.
- Never show raw exception messages to users. Map exceptions to user-friendly strings.

### 4.4 Async and Concurrency

- Every `async` function must handle errors. No fire-and-forget unless explicitly intentional.
- Mark intentional fire-and-forget with `unawaited()` from `dart:async`.
- Cancel stream subscriptions in `dispose()`. Use Riverpod's `ref.onDispose` for provider cleanup.
- Never `await` inside a loop for sequential network calls — use `Future.wait` for parallel calls.

### 4.5 Widget Rules

- Every widget file contains exactly one primary widget class.
- Prefer `const` constructors everywhere possible.
- Extract any widget subtree exceeding ~50 lines into its own named widget class.
- Never put business logic (API calls, DB queries) inside `build()` methods.
- Use `ListView.builder` / `SliverList` for any list that could exceed 20 items — never `Column` with many children.

### 4.6 Date and Time

- Store all datetimes in UTC in the database.
- Convert to `Asia/Jakarta` only at the display layer using the `timezone` package.
- Never use `DateTime.now()` directly for expiry logic — always use `DateTime.now().toUtc()`.
- Use the `intl` package for all date formatting. Never manually format dates with string interpolation.

```dart
// CORRECT
import 'package:intl/intl.dart';
import 'package:timezone/timezone.dart' as tz;

final jakarta = tz.getLocation('Asia/Jakarta');
final localNow = tz.TZDateTime.now(jakarta);
final formatted = DateFormat('dd MMM yyyy', 'id_ID').format(localNow);

// WRONG
final formatted = '${date.day}/${date.month}/${date.year}';
```

### 4.7 Comments and Documentation

- Every public class and public method must have a doc comment (`///`).
- Explain *why*, not *what* — the code shows what; comments explain reasoning.
- Mark unfinished work with `// TODO(username): description` — never leave silent dead code.
- Do not comment out code — delete it. Git history preserves it.

---

## 5. Flutter-Specific Rules

### 5.1 Theming

- All colors, text styles, and spacing must come from `ThemeData` — no hardcoded values in widgets.
- Define a single `AppTheme` class in `core/theme/` that exports `lightTheme` and `darkTheme`.
- Support dark mode from day one. Never assume `Colors.white` as a background.
- Use Material 3 (`useMaterial3: true`). Do not use deprecated Material 2 components.

### 5.2 Navigation

- Use **GoRouter** for all navigation. No `Navigator.push` directly.
- Define all routes as named constants in a `AppRoutes` class.
- Handle deep links and auth redirect guards in the GoRouter `redirect` callback.
- Never pass large objects through route parameters — pass IDs only, load data in the destination.

### 5.3 Performance

- Use `flutter_hooks` or Riverpod's `select` to prevent unnecessary widget rebuilds.
- Profile with Flutter DevTools before declaring any screen "done."
- Image assets: use WebP format, provide 1x/2x/3x variants, use `cached_network_image` for remote images.
- Avoid `Opacity` widget for animations — use `AnimatedOpacity` or `FadeTransition`.

### 5.4 Accessibility

- All interactive elements must have a minimum touch target of 48×48dp.
- Every image must have a `semanticLabel`. Every icon button must have a `Tooltip`.
- Support font scaling — never use hardcoded font sizes that ignore `MediaQuery.textScaleFactor`.
- Test with TalkBack (Android) and VoiceOver (iOS) before each release.

## 6. Supabase Rules

### 6.1 Client Initialization

```dart
// in main.dart — initialize before runApp
await Supabase.initialize(
  url: const String.fromEnvironment('SUPABASE_URL'),
  anonKey: const String.fromEnvironment('SUPABASE_ANON_KEY'),
  authOptions: const FlutterAuthClientOptions(
    authFlowType: AuthFlowType.pkce,  // PKCE for mobile security
  ),
  realtimeClientOptions: const RealtimeClientOptions(
    logLevel: RealtimeLogLevel.info,
  ),
);
```

### 6.2 Database Migrations

- Every schema change must be a versioned SQL migration file in `supabase/migrations/`.
- Never modify an existing migration — always create a new one.
- Migration filenames: `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_description.sql`
- Include rollback SQL as a comment at the bottom of every migration.
- Test migrations on a local Supabase instance (`supabase start`) before applying to cloud.

### 6.3 Realtime Subscriptions

- Subscribe to changes per `family_group_id` — never subscribe to entire tables.
- Always unsubscribe on widget/provider dispose using `channel.unsubscribe()`.
- Handle subscription errors and reconnect gracefully — network drops are normal on mobile.

### 6.4 Edge Functions

- Use Edge Functions only for: expiry check cron jobs, FCM push dispatch.
- Edge Functions must validate the calling user's JWT before doing anything.
- Keep functions small and single-purpose. No function should exceed ~150 lines.

## 7. Testing Requirements

### 7.1 What Must Be Tested

| Layer | Tool | Coverage target |
|---|---|---|
| Domain use cases | `flutter_test` | 100% |
| Repository implementations | `mocktail` mocks | 80%+ |
| Expiry engine logic | `flutter_test` | 100% |
| Date/timezone utils | `flutter_test` | 100% |
| Critical widgets | `flutter_test` widget tests | Key user flows |

### 7.2 Test Conventions

- Test file mirrors source file: `lib/domain/usecases/get_assets.dart` → `test/domain/usecases/get_assets_test.dart`
- Use `mocktail` for mocking — not `mockito` (requires code gen).
- Arrange / Act / Assert structure in every test.
- Test edge cases: empty lists, null fields, network errors, timezone boundaries.

---

## 8. Git and Commit Rules

- Branch naming: `feat/`, `fix/`, `chore/`, `refactor/` prefixes.
- Commit messages follow Conventional Commits: `feat(assets): add swipe-to-delete on asset card`
- Never commit: `.env`, `*.jks`, `google-services.json`, `GoogleService-Info.plist`, `*.keystore`
- These files go in `.gitignore` before the first commit.
- Run `flutter test` locally before pushing. Never push a failing test.

## 10. What the Agent Must Never Do

- Never disable RLS on any Supabase table.
- Never store secrets in source code or commit them.
- Never use `dynamic` types — always use explicit types.
- Never call Supabase directly from a widget — always go through use cases → repositories.
- Never use `DateTime.now()` for expiry comparisons without UTC conversion.
- Never use `print()` — use a proper logger (`logger` package) with log levels.
- Never generate placeholder/dummy screens without wiring up real providers.
- Never skip error handling with empty `catch {}` blocks.
- Never use `Column` for long scrollable lists — always use `ListView.builder`.
- Never hardcode Indonesian strings — use `intl` ARB files for all user-facing text (i18n-ready from day one even if only Indonesian is supported initially).
