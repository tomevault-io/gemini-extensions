# unthrown

A small, focused TypeScript library for **explicit errors as values**, with a
separate **defect channel** for the unexpected.

It exists because the alternatives fall short: `boxed` and `neverthrow` don't
model unexpected errors through a defect channel and don't enforce error
qualification when crossing async boundaries; `effect` is too heavy and conflates
error handling with context, runtime, etc. `unthrown` does one thing.

The name states the concern: ordinary errors are _unthrown_ — returned as values,
not flung up the stack. Only a true defect ever throws (at `unwrap`).

This file is the authoritative spec — the rules _and_ the reasoning behind them.
Keep it in sync with the code as the library evolves (describe what _is_, not what
was planned).

## Thesis (do not drift from these)

1. **`Result<T, E>` where `E` is only the _anticipated_ domain failures.** A
   defect (an unmodeled failure) is the third variant of the `Result` union
   (`{ tag: "Defect" }`), but it **never appears in `E`**. If a failure mode
   appears in `E`, it is by definition modeled and is no longer a defect. The
   defect is matchable like any variant, but you never thread it through your
   domain error type.
2. **No `Option` type.** Absence is expressed with the type system we already
   trust: `T | undefined`, `T | null`, or `Result<T, NotFound>`. Interop with
   nullable third-party APIs goes through `fromNullable`. Do not add `Option`.
3. **Qualification is enforced at every boundary.** `fromPromise` / `fromThrowable`
   take a mandatory `qualify: (cause: unknown, defect) => E | Defect`, where
   `defect` is a helper the boundary **injects** as the second argument (domain
   code never imports it — the qualify-time marker is not a public value). There
   is no path that produces `unknown` in `E`. The boundary forces a triage
   decision. The
   modeled error type is inferred as **`Exclude<R, Defect>`** (where `R` is
   `qualify`'s return type): the `Defect` arm is _subtracted_ from `E`, never
   inferred into it — a defect-only `qualify` yields `E = never`, not
   `E = Defect` (sound because `Defect` is `unique symbol`-branded, so no domain
   error is assignable to it). This is also why **`AsyncResult` combinator
   callbacks are synchronous** — a raw `Promise` may never enter an `AsyncResult`
   method (its rejection would silently become a defect, skipping the triage).
   Async work re-enters only through `fromPromise` / `fromSafePromise` and
   composes via `flatMap`.
4. **`TaggedError` is the error convention** (à la Effect's `Data.TaggedError`):
   a `_tag` discriminant on a class extending `Error`. Core `Result<T, E>` stays
   **generic in `E`** (unconstrained); only the tag-aware utilities require
   `E extends { _tag: string }`.

## Load-bearing runtime invariants (tests must guard these)

- **Throw → defect.** Any value thrown by a callback inside a combinator
  (`map`, `flatMap`, `flatTap`, `bind`, `let`, `mapErr`, `orElse`, `recover`,
  `tap*`, `flatTapErr`, `recoverDefect`) is caught and converted to a `Defect`. Nothing
  escapes a pipeline as a raw throw.
  This is what lets an HTTP adapter do a single `match({ ok, err, defect })`
  with **no surrounding `try/catch`**.
- **A `Defect` flows through every method untouched EXCEPT `match()` and
  `recoverDefect()`.** Therefore `unwrapOr`, `unwrapOrElse`, `getOrNull`,
  `getOrUndefined` still **throw** on a `Defect` — they recover the modeled `Err`,
  never an unmodeled defect (a defect is a bug, not an absent value).
- **`unwrap()` is asymmetric.** On `Err` it throws a `UnwrapError` carrying `E`
  (on both the typed `.error` property and the standard `Error.cause`, so an
  `Error`-typed `E` chains its original stack under "caused by").
  On a `Defect` it **rethrows the original `cause`** (it _panics_) with its
  original stack, so an unhandled defect hits the global handler looking like the
  real failure.
- **`recover` returns `Result<T | U, never>`, and `never` means only the _error_
  channel is empty — a `Defect` can still be present at runtime.** This is the one
  place the type intentionally under-describes the runtime. Do not read `never`
  as "total".
- **An `AsyncResult`'s internal promise NEVER rejects.** Every rejection or
  thrown value is captured as `Err` (via `qualify`) or `Defect`. `await`-ing an
  `AsyncResult` always yields a `Result` and never throws.

## Public surface (implemented in packages/core/src/, split into focused modules)

`Result<T, E>` is a **discriminated union** — `{ tag: "Ok"; value } | { tag:
"Err"; error } | { tag: "Defect"; cause }`, each intersected with the shared
method surface — so it matches **natively** (a `switch` on `tag`, or
`ts-pattern`'s `match(r).with({ tag: "Ok" }, …).exhaustive()`) **and** chains
fluently. The payload is reachable only after narrowing, so "check before you
access" still holds.

`AsyncResult<T, E>` shares that method surface as an awaitable wrapper typed
`Awaitable<Result<T, E>>` — a **success-only thenable**, not a full `PromiseLike`
(its internal promise never rejects, so there is no rejection channel to model).
Its **combinator callbacks are synchronous** (no raw `Promise` — see Thesis #3);
async work re-enters via `fromPromise` / `fromSafePromise` and composes with
`flatMap`. `await` collapses an `AsyncResult` to a `Result` (then match it).

- success: `map`, `flatMap`, `tap`, `flatTap` (a failable `tap` — runs a
  `Result`-returning effect, keeps the original value, threads the effect's
  error), `as`
- do-notation: `Do()` (entry — `Ok({})`, an empty object scope; capitalised
  because `do` is reserved) plus the methods `bind(name, f)` (sequence a
  `Result`-returning step, binding its value under `name` in an accumulating
  **readonly** object scope; errors union `E | E2`) and `let(name, f)` (bind a
  pure value). On `AsyncResult`, `bind`'s `f` may return a `Result` or an
  `AsyncResult`. A throw in either becomes a `Defect`; `Err`/`Defect`
  short-circuits/passes through. To go async, lift with `toAsync()`.
- error: `mapErr`, `orElse`, `recover`, `tapErr`, `flatTapErr` (the error-channel
  mirror of `flatTap` — runs a `Result`-returning effect on the error, keeps the
  original error, threads the effect's error)
- defect: `recoverDefect`, `tapDefect`
- eliminate: `match`, `unwrap`, `unwrapErr`, `unwrapOr`, `unwrapOrElse`,
  `getOrNull`, `getOrUndefined`
- guards: methods `isOk`/`isErr`/`isDefect` **and** standalone
  `isOk`/`isErr`/`isDefect` both narrow (to `OkView`/`ErrView`/`DefectView`) — the
  methods are `this is …` type predicates, so `if (r.isErr()) r.error` compiles.
  One narrowing concept, two call styles. Plus the standalone `isResult(x)` —
  narrows an `unknown` to `Result<unknown, unknown>` (a prototype check, so a
  plain `{ tag: "Ok" }` look-alike is not matched), for untyped boundaries.
- constructors: `Ok`, `Err` (there is **no** `Defect` constructor — a defect-state
  `Result` arises only at boundaries; the qualify-time `defect` marker helper is
  injected, not exported)
- interop: `fromNullable`, `fromThrowable`, `fromPromise`, `fromSafePromise`
- aggregate: `all` / `allAsync` take a **tuple/array** (a fixed tuple keeps
  positional types; a dynamic `Result<T, E>[]` / `AsyncResult<T, E>[]` collapses
  to `Result<T[], E>` / `AsyncResult<T[], E>`), while `allFromDict` /
  `allFromDictAsync` take a **record** keyed by name (`{ a: Result<A, E> }` →
  `Result<{ a: A }, E>`) — named parallel work without tupling. Array and record
  are **separate functions**, not one overload (positional vs named is a distinct
  concept). All four short-circuit on the first `Err`, let any `Defect` dominate,
  and are **not** error accumulation (which stays deliberately excluded);
  `allAsync` / `allFromDictAsync` resolve concurrently (order preserved) and never
  reject. The record fold writes keys via `Object.defineProperty`, so a
  caller-supplied `"__proto__"` key can't pollute the prototype.
- facade: two companion objects alias the standalone entry points, **grouped by
  what they return** so a static lives in exactly one namespace. `Result.*` holds
  the `Result`-producing ones
  (`Result.Ok`/`Err`/`Do`/`fromNullable`/`fromThrowable`/`all`/`allFromDict`/`is*`);
  `AsyncResult.*` holds the `AsyncResult`-producing ones
  (`AsyncResult.fromPromise`/`fromSafePromise`/`all`/`allFromDict` — the
  aggregates drop the `Async` suffix the free functions carry, since the
  namespace already says async). Both are value+type companions (the value and
  the `Result<T,E>` / `AsyncResult<T,E>` type share one name). The free functions
  remain the primary, tree-shakeable API; the companions are opt-in sugar (only
  code importing a companion value forgoes tree-shaking). One concept, two import
  styles — not a second concept. (Each companion re-aliases its type in
  `facade.ts`, so the `types.ts` `Result`/`AsyncResult` declarations both sit in
  `typedoc.json`'s `intentionallyNotExported`.)
- tagged errors: `TaggedError(tag, options?)` (the error-class factory; optional
  `options.name` sets `Error.name` independently of the `_tag` discriminant, so a
  tag can be namespaced for collision-safety without leaking into the display
  name) and `matchTags(result, handlers)` (an exhaustive `{ Ok, Defect } &
per-tag` fold; has an async overload resolving to `Promise<R>`); see the
  `TaggedError` convention in Thesis #4.

Deliberately **excluded** for now: **generator** do-notation (`gen`/`yield*`
"safeTry" style — the fluent `Do`/`bind`/`let` above covers sequential code
without the generator machinery), accumulation/`Validation`, and aliases
(`andThen`, etc. — one name per concept). Keep the surface small enough that the
library can be "done".

## Internal design (don't break these)

- **`Result` / `AsyncResult` are the public types; `Res` / `AsyncRes` are the
  internal classes** (in `core.ts`, **never re-exported from `index.ts`**).
  `Result` is a discriminated union (`{ tag; value/error/cause } & methods`) where
  each variant is `Res` (a method holder, like boxed's `__Result`) intersected
  with its `tag`/payload. `Res` is **never `new`'d**: the builders
  `okRes`/`errRes`/`defectRes` create instances with `Object.create(Res.prototype)`
  and return them as the variant type (`OkView`/`ErrView`/`DefectView`) — so a
  builder yields a value that already _is_ a union member, with **no construction
  cast**. `Res` methods type `this` as `Result<T, E>` and narrow on `tag`. The
  type-changing pass-throughs (`map` reusing an `Err` as a differently-typed
  `Result`) **all funnel through one `passThrough` helper** — a single sound
  `as unknown as` in one place (boxed instead casts inline at every branch), since
  the passed-through variant carries no value of the changed success type. We
  deliberately **do not reconstruct** the variant (neverthrow's approach) — that
  would allocate a fresh object on every short-circuit. The only other casts are
  the `bind`/`let` scope merge (a computed key widens to an index signature, so it
  can't be spelled at the type level) and the builder construction noted above.
- "Check before you access" is enforced by the union: `result.value` only
  type-checks on the `Ok` variant. `AsyncRes` operates purely on the public
  `Result` union (wraps a `Promise<Result>`, branches on `r.tag`), never on `Res`
  internals.
- **Builders are free functions** (`Ok`, `Err`, …) because they tree-shake — and
  every shipped package sets `"sideEffects": false` so bundlers can prune between
  modules (the sole exception is `@unthrown/vitest`, whose top-level
  `expect.extend` registration is a genuine import-time effect). A `bundle-size`
  CI job reports the per-package `dist` sizes to the run summary — it is
  informational (no threshold), not a hard gate. The `Result` companion
  object is additive sugar (value + type share the name via a re-alias in
  `facade.ts`); it must stay a separate export so `import { Ok }` never pulls it
  in.
- **`AsyncResult` is `Awaitable<Result<T,E>>`, not `PromiseLike`.** Its `then`
  stays a runtime thenable (so `await` collapses it) and forwards `onrejected`
  defensively, but the type advertises no rejection channel — because the internal
  promise never rejects.
- **Source layout** (`packages/core/src/`): `types.ts` (public types), `defect.ts`
  (the `Defect` marker), `core.ts` (the `Res`/`AsyncRes` engine + `UnwrapError`),
  `constructors.ts` (`Ok`/`Err` + guards), `interop.ts` (`from*`/`qualify`/`all`),
  `facade.ts` (the `Result` object), `tagged.ts` (`TaggedError`/`matchTags`), and
  `index.ts` (the curated public re-exports — the one place the API is decided).

## Monorepo layout

- `packages/core` → `unthrown` (zero runtime dependencies)
- `packages/pattern` → `@unthrown/pattern` (peerDep `ts-pattern`)
- `packages/vitest` → `@unthrown/vitest` (peerDep `vitest`)
- `packages/effect` → `@unthrown/effect` (peerDep `effect`)
- `packages/neverthrow` → `@unthrown/neverthrow` (peerDep `neverthrow`)
- `packages/boxed` → `@unthrown/boxed` (peerDep `@bloodyowl/boxed` — Boxed's
  maintained scope; `@swan-io/boxed` is the deprecated former name)
- `packages/standard-schema` → `@unthrown/standard-schema` (dep on the
  types-only `@standard-schema/spec`; bridges Zod/Valibot/ArkType validators to
  `Result` via `fromSchema` / `fromSchemaAsync`, with the validation issues as
  the modeled `E`)
- `packages/oxlint` → `@unthrown/oxlint` (an oxlint **JS plugin**, peerDep
  `oxlint`, dep `@oxlint/plugins`; ships `no-ambiguous-error-type` — enforces
  Thesis #1 against `unknown`/`any`/`Error`/`{}` in `E` — and
  `prefer-async-result`. Purely syntactic AST rules that resolve the import
  source via scope analysis so they only fire on unthrown's `Result`. No TypeDoc
  API page; documented in the Linting guide. Tested with oxlint's `RuleTester`
  from `oxlint/plugins-dev`.)
- `tools/tsconfig`, `tools/typedoc` → private shared config (`@unthrown/tsconfig`,
  `@unthrown/typedoc`)
- `docs` → `@unthrown/docs`, the VitePress site (guide + TypeDoc-generated API
  reference); deployed to GitHub Pages by `deploy-docs.yml`

Never pull `ts-pattern`, `vitest`, or any interop peer (`effect`, `neverthrow`,
`@bloodyowl/boxed`) into core.

### Interop packages (`packages/effect`, `packages/neverthrow`, `packages/boxed`)

Thin `to*`/`from*` bridges between `Result`/`AsyncResult` and a neighbour's
types. One rule decides their shape: **does the neighbour have a defect
channel?**

- **Effect does** (`Cause.die`), so `Result ↔ Exit` is a genuine **bijection**
  (`Ok↔succeed`, `Err↔Cause.fail`, `Defect↔Cause.die`). `fromExit` lets a
  `Defect` **dominate** a modeled failure in a composite cause (same rule as
  `all`). `toEither` has no defect target, so it takes a mandatory `onDefect`.
- **neverthrow and Boxed do not.** Coming _in_, results are only `Ok`/`Err` —
  never a `Defect`. Going _out_, every `to*` takes a **mandatory `onDefect:
(cause) => E`** (forced triage, Thesis #3): a defect is never silently folded
  into `E`. There is no one-arg form.
- A `Defect` `Result` has no public constructor (defects arise at boundaries).
  The only place one is minted is `@unthrown/effect`'s `fromExit`, which replays
  Effect's `die` cause through the `fromThrowable` boundary — itself a genuine
  un-triaged-failure boundary.

## Status (all four roadmap items shipped)

1. ✅ **Scaffold the workspace.** Done — pnpm + turbo workspace, dual CJS/ESM
   tsdown build, strict shared tsconfig, oxlint/oxfmt, knip, changesets, CI. The
   core `unthrown` package is split into focused modules, fully TSDoc'd, and
   covered by a 108-test suite (100% line/function coverage). (Publishing the
   names to npm remains a manual step.)
2. ✅ **`packages/core/src/tagged.ts`** — Done. `TaggedError(tag)` factory
   (extends `Error`, `_tag`, no-arg constructor when payload is empty via the
   `keyof A extends never ? void : A` trick) and `matchTags(result, handlers)`:
   a zero-dependency exhaustive fold whose handler object is
   `{ Ok, Defect } & { [K in E["_tag"]]: (e: Extract<E, {_tag: K}>) => R }`.
3. ✅ **`packages/vitest`** — Done. Custom matchers `toBeOk`, `toBeOkWith`,
   `toBeErr`, `toBeErrTagged` (optional second arg also matches the tagged
   error's payload — exact for a plain object, partial for an asymmetric matcher
   like `expect.objectContaining`), `toBeDefect`, registered via `expect.extend`
   and augmenting Vitest's `Matchers` interface. They detect a thenable
   `AsyncResult` and await internally, so a test reads
   `await expect(asyncResult).toBeOk()` (the required `await` is documented loudly
   — a forgotten one passes silently).
4. ✅ **`packages/pattern`** — Done. Because `Result` is a discriminated union
   (Thesis #1 / Public surface), `ts-pattern` matches it natively — this package
   is thin sugar: pattern constructors `P.ok`/`P.err`/`P.defect` (returning the
   `{ tag: … }` object patterns) plus `tag(t)` (the `{ _tag: t }` pattern,
   narrowing to the variant + payload). Kept small — the power is ts-pattern's;
   `matchTags` covers the everyday exhaustive case.

Also shipped: a root `README` + `LICENSE`, per-package READMEs, and the VitePress
docs site (guide + generated API reference). **Remaining work is manual** and
cannot be automated from here: publish `unthrown` + the `@unthrown` scope to npm,
create the `RELEASE_PAT` secret, and configure npm Trusted Publishers for the
changesets `release.yml` (plus enabling GitHub Pages for `deploy-docs.yml`).

## Toolchain & conventions

- **Stack:** pnpm (catalog) + turbo; build with **tsdown** (dual CJS/ESM + d.ts);
  lint/format with **oxlint** / **oxfmt**; **knip** for dead-code/deps; **vitest**
  (+ v8 coverage); **typedoc** (markdown) feeding **vitepress**; **changesets**
  for releases; **lefthook** + **commitlint** (conventional commits) on commit.
- **Gate (all must stay green):** `pnpm format --check`, `pnpm lint`,
  `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm knip`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm build`. CI mirrors these.
- TypeScript `strict` + `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` + `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`;
  ESM-first; `moduleResolution: NodeNext` (relative imports use `.js`).
- **oxlint rules are binding:** no `interface` (use `type`), no `any` (use
  `unknown`). Genuine exceptions (e.g. the `vitest` `Matchers` augmentation, the
  `AsyncRes.then` thenable) carry a targeted `oxlint-disable` with a reason.
- Tests: Vitest. Every load-bearing invariant above gets an explicit test
  (`invariants.spec.ts` guards them 1:1); core holds 100% line/function coverage,
  enforced by thresholds in its `vitest.config.ts`.
- **Type-level tests:** `packages/core/src/types.test-d.ts` asserts the
  type-level behaviour the runtime can't (the conditional `all`/`allFromDict`
  shapes, `Exclude<R, Defect>` boundary inference, `flatTap`/`recover` channel
  widening, the `this is …` guard narrowing, `matchTags` exhaustiveness) with a
  `Expect<Equal<…>>` helper plus `@ts-expect-error` for must-not-compile cases.
  They are checked by `tsc` via `tsconfig.test-d.json` (which relaxes
  `noUnusedLocals`), folded into the package's `typecheck` script — so a typing
  regression fails the gate. The file is excluded from the build, coverage,
  oxlint, and knip (it has no runtime).
- Public API carries full **TSDoc**; `pnpm --filter <pkg> build:docs` must stay
  typedoc-warning-free.
- One concept = one name. Resist convenience aliases.
- The core has **no runtime dependencies**. This is a feature; protect it.
