# PolyFun — AI Agent Guide

Lean 4 library for polynomial functors, interaction trees, and a generic
interaction framework over a polynomial substrate. Built on Mathlib.

## Fast Start

1. Run `lake exe cache get && lake build`.
2. To gauge the Polynomial-functor / FreeM substrate, start with
   [`PolyFun/PFunctor/Basic.lean`](PolyFun/PFunctor/Basic.lean) and
   [`PolyFun/PFunctor/Free/Basic.lean`](PolyFun/PFunctor/Free/Basic.lean).
3. To gauge interaction trees, start with
   [`PolyFun/ITree/Basic.lean`](PolyFun/ITree/Basic.lean).
4. To gauge the protocol-flavored interaction framework, start with
   [`PolyFun/Interaction/Basic/TypeTree.lean`](PolyFun/Interaction/Basic/TypeTree.lean)
   and [`PolyFun/Interaction/Basic/Decoration.lean`](PolyFun/Interaction/Basic/Decoration.lean).

`AGENTS.md` is the canonical guide. `CLAUDE.md` is a symlink to this file.

## What This Project Is

PolyFun packages three layers of generic, domain-agnostic infrastructure
that emerged from the cryptographic-protocols formalization in
[`Verified-zkEVM/VCVio`](https://github.com/Verified-zkEVM/VCVio):

1. **Polynomial functors and lenses.** `PFunctor` cores (positions /
   directions), polynomial charts, lenses (Cartesian, state),
   equivalences, free monad `FreeM`, displayed `FreeM`, and the
   `Cofree` / M-type companion. The Spivak-Niu *Poly* category and its
   internal-language fragments live here. The free monads are re-exported
   from upstream [`leanprover/cslib`](https://github.com/leanprover/cslib)
   (a pinned lake dependency): `PFunctor.FreeM` from
   `Cslib.Foundations.Data.PFunctor.Free` and the functor-generic
   `Cslib.FreeM` from `Cslib.Foundations.Control.Monad.Free`; PolyFun adds
   its own API on top.
2. **Interaction trees** in the style of Xia-Zakowski-He-Hur-Malecha-
   Pierce-Zdancewic (POPL 2020), modeled as the M-type of a one-step
   polynomial functor, with strong / weak bisimulation, simulation,
   handlers, and event signatures.
3. **Generic interaction framework** for sequential, two-party,
   multi-party, and concurrent interaction over a `TypeTree` polynomial
   substrate (`TypeTree := PFunctor.FreeM TypeTree.basePFunctor PUnit`), with
   structural decoration, syntax / strategy / execution lenses, and an
   open-process layer for compositional reasoning. Hancock-Setzer
   recursion over interaction interfaces.

PolyFun is intentionally *not* the place for cryptographic content.
Probabilistic semantics, evaluation distributions, oracle-simulation
security definitions, scheme-specific algebra, and concrete-protocol
runtime layers all live in
[`Verified-zkEVM/VCVio`](https://github.com/Verified-zkEVM/VCVio)
and depend on this library.

## Repo Map

- `PolyFun/PFunctor/`: polynomial functors, charts, lenses, equivalences,
  M-type / cofree, free monad and displayed-free machinery.
- `PolyFun/IPFunctor/`: state-indexed polynomial functors (`IPFunctor I`)
  and their indexed free monads. `Free/Basic.lean` holds the single-index
  `FreeM` (state-polymorphic continuations); `Free/Indexed.lean` holds the
  two-index `FreeM₂` carrying a `LawfulIndexedMonad` instance.
- `PolyFun/ITree/`: coinductive interaction trees, same-signature weak
  bisimulation, cross-signature relational trees (`Bisim/CrossSignature.lean`),
  simulation, handlers, event signatures, and finite observation traces.
- `PolyFun/Interaction/`: protocol-flavored generic interaction framework.
  - `Basic/`: `TypeTree`, node contexts, decorations, syntax / shape /
    interaction, strategies, append / replicate / state-chain
    composition.
  - `TwoParty/`: sender / receiver roles, paired strategies, refinement,
    swap, composition.
  - `Multiparty/`: native multiparty local views and per-party profiles.
  - `Concurrent/`: structural concurrent specs, frontiers, processes,
    machines, traces, fairness, liveness, refinement, bisimulation,
    interleaving, observation.
  - `UC/`: open-process / open-theory layer, structural composition
    (interfaces, par, wire, plug), corruption models, environment
    actions, leakage. *Generic only* — security-flavored UC layers
    (computational equivalence, asymptotic security) live in VCVio.
- `PolyFun/Control/`: monad and comonad infrastructure transitively
  required by the above (coalgebra, comonad, free / freecont monad
  algebra, monad iter / hom, lawful re-exports).
- `PolyFun/Control/LTS/Trace.lean`: generic finite visible traces over the
  silent/visible `Control.LTS` layer and preservation by weak simulation.
- `PolyFun/Logic/`: small logic helpers (`HEq`).
- `PolyFunTest/`: separate test / worked-example library (glob
  `PolyFunTest.+`), built by `lake test` and kept out of the `lake lint`
  scope. Holds the dynamical / interaction worked examples and the
  `IPFunctor` `do`-notation smoke tests. Imports `PolyFun` one-way; nothing
  in `PolyFun` depends on it.

## Module Layering

Imports flow strictly downward; cycles are a build error. The canonical
dependency map lives in [`docs/wiki/repo-map.md`](docs/wiki/repo-map.md#conceptual-layering).
Update that map when a change adds a module or changes an import boundary.

New files must respect the documented DAG. Re-exports through
`PolyFun.lean` are auto-generated; do not hand-edit.

## Attribution, Headers, And Docstrings

Follow [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the repo's explicit
attribution policy.

- The copyright line on every Lean file is `Copyright (c) <YEAR>
  PolyFun Contributors. All rights reserved.` — *always* "PolyFun
  Contributors", never an individual. This matches the
  [`Verified-zkEVM/ArkLib`](https://github.com/Verified-zkEVM/ArkLib)
  convention and keeps copyright ownership with the project.
- The `Authors:` line names individual humans (comma-separated for
  multiple authors). This is the human-attribution channel and is
  preserved on routine edits.
- New Lean files should use the standard copyright / license /
  authors header and a module docstring.
- For ordinary Lean source files, use the standard prologue layout:
  header, blank line, imports, blank line, module docstring.
- Docstrings must be intrinsic and descriptive. Cross-reference live
  sibling definitions when helpful, but do not mention removed or
  renamed declarations, change history, or reactive wording such as
  "replaces" or "renamed from".
- Preserve the `Authors:` line on routine edits. The copyright line
  stays "PolyFun Contributors" regardless of who edits.
- Only rewrite the `Authors:` line when a file is genuinely new or
  materially replaced.
- Do not add a separate AI-attribution line.
- For inline section breaks within a Lean file, use Mathlib-style
  doc-comment headers `/-! ## Title -/` (or the multi-line
  `/-! ## Title \n\n explanation -/` form). **Do not use ASCII banners**
  such as `-- ====...===` flanking a `-- § Title` line. The `/-!` form
  is rendered by `doc-gen4`; ASCII banners are not, and they make the
  file feel artificially partitioned. If a section is large enough to
  want a loud header, it is usually large enough to want its own
  `namespace` or its own file. See *Section Headers Within A File* in
  [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Naming Conventions

Follow Mathlib convention: `{head_symbol}_{operation}_{rhs_form}`.
Examples: `FreeM.bind_pure`, `Decoration.map_comp`, `ITree.bisim_bind`.
Structures use UpperCamelCase: `PFunctor`, `TypeTree`, `Decoration`,
`SyntaxOver`, `InteractionOver`, `ITree.Shape`.

## Critical Gotchas

1. **`autoImplicit = false` is set globally in `lakefile.toml`.** Do not
   add `set_option autoImplicit false` in individual files. Every
   variable must be explicitly declared.
2. **No cryptographic content.** Do not introduce dependencies on
   probability monads, evaluation distributions, security predicates,
   or concrete-scheme algebra. Parameterize over an abstract monad
   instead. Cryptographic content belongs in
   [`Verified-zkEVM/VCVio`](https://github.com/Verified-zkEVM/VCVio).
3. **`TypeTree.done` and `TypeTree.node` are `@[match_pattern, reducible]`**
   wrappers over `PFunctor.FreeM.{pure, liftBind}`. Pattern matching on
   them works transparently; `rfl` against the polynomial substrate
   also works. Do not break either invariant when refactoring.
4. **Files should stay under 1500 lines** unless explicitly opted out
   per file. The long-file linter cap is enforced repo-wide.
5. **Do not disable linters to silence errors.** Do not use
   `set_option linter.* false`, `set_option weak.linter.* false`, or
   add repo-level `leanOptions` that turn lints off. Fix the root
   cause instead. The one narrow exception is a declaration-scoped
   `set_option linter.checkUnivs false in` when independent universe
   parameters are mathematically and compositionally intentional; explain
   that reason in an adjacent comment. This matches the treatment of
   universe-separated polynomial position/direction data upstream.
6. **`PolyFun.lean` is generated.** Do not hand-edit it. After adding,
   renaming, or deleting `.lean` files under `PolyFun/`, run
   `./scripts/update-lib.sh`.
7. **Do not introduce `sorry` or `admit` in finished work.** Use `stop`
   only when explicitly preserving partial proof work during a refactor.

## Building

```bash
lake exe cache get && lake build
```

After adding new `.lean` files: `./scripts/update-lib.sh`.
For routine local validation: `./scripts/validate.sh`.

Environment linters and the test library have Lake drivers:

```bash
lake lint   # Batteries runLinter over the PolyFun library
lake test   # builds the PolyFunTest library
```

`./scripts/validate.sh --lint --test` folds both into the convenience wrapper.
Both run as independent CI jobs (`lint`, `test`) alongside `build`. Adding a
per-declaration `@[nolint <linter>]` exception requires
`import Batteries.Tactic.Lint` in that file.

The cslib dependency registers its `topNamespace` environment linter. PolyFun's
intentional root-level notation, typeclasses, and compatibility instances are
listed declaration-by-declaration in `scripts/nolints.json`; regenerate that
file with the Batteries `runLinter --update` driver when this surface changes,
and review every new entry rather than treating the file as a blanket waiver.

Lean toolchain, Mathlib, and cslib stay in sync (all currently `v4.32.0`).
Files should stay under 1500 lines.

### Wiki Maintenance Contract

The wiki is maintained alongside the Lean source. Treat it as the canonical
long-form companion to this guide, while remembering that source files are the
final authority for names, imports, and theorem statements:

- If a page contradicts the source, the source wins. Fix the page in the
  same PR.
- If a PR changes commands, repo structure, generated-file behavior, file
  naming, namespaces, or load-bearing public APIs, update the matching wiki
  page in the same PR. Add a new page when that is the cleaner split.
- Promote recurring agent learnings into [`docs/wiki/`](docs/wiki/); do not
  let stable guidance live only in ephemeral notes (`*-NEVER-COMMIT.md`,
  scratch chats, scratch worktrees).
- Prefer linking to canonical docs (Lean source, Mathlib, papers in
  [`REFERENCES.md`](REFERENCES.md)) over copying their contents.
