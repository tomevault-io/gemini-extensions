# AGENTS.md — Container-Compose

Guidance for autonomous coding agents working in this repository.

This file is the canonical orientation for agents (and humans) joining the project.
Read it before exploring. It mirrors the structure of `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md`
conventions used in agent-driven workflows.

---

## 1. Project Summary

**Container-Compose** is a Swift 6.1 CLI that brings *limited* Docker Compose
support to [Apple Container](https://github.com/apple/container). It parses
`docker-compose.yml` and orchestrates services via Apple's `container` runtime
on macOS.

- **Language / toolchain:** Swift 6.1, SwiftPM, macOS 15+ (best on macOS 26 Tahoe).
- **CLI entry:** `container-compose <subcommand>` (driven by `swift-argument-parser`).
- **Distribution:** Homebrew (`brew install container-compose`) or `make build && make install`.
- **License:** MIT.

The project is **not** a Docker / Docker Compose wrapper. It directly
interprets the Compose schema and translates a (large) subset to
`container run` / `container build` / `container network create` invocations.

### Dependencies (`Package.swift`)

| Package                | Source                                        | Purpose                          |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `swift-argument-parser`| github.com/apple/swift-argument-parser ≥1.5.1 | CLI parsing                      |
| `container`            | github.com/mcrich23/container (custom branch) | Apple Container client APIs      |
| `Yams`                 | github.com/jpsim/Yams ≥5.0.6                  | YAML decoder                     |
| `Rainbow`              | github.com/onevcat/Rainbow ≥4.0.0             | ANSI-colored per-service output  |

Note the `container` dependency points at `mcrich23/container` on branch
`add-command-option-group-function-macro` — this is an upstream-fork that
exposes the macro `Container-Compose` needs to compose subcommands. Keep this
in mind when bumping versions.

## 3. How the Code Is Organized

### 3.1 Codable Structs (Schema → Swift)

Every top-level Compose entity has a dedicated `Codable` struct. The decoder
goes through `Yams.YAMLDecoder().decode(DockerCompose.self, …)`.

| File                       | Type                  | Compose entity       |
| -------------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------- |
| `DockerCompose.swift`      | `DockerCompose`       | root document        |
| `Service.swift`            | `Service`             | `services.<name>`    |
| `Build.swift`              | `Build`               | `service.build`      |
| `Healthcheck.swift`        | `Healthcheck`         | `service.healthcheck`|
| `Deploy.swift`             | `Deploy`              | `service.deploy`     |
| `DeployRestartPolicy.swift`| `DeployRestartPolicy` | `deploy.restart_policy` |
| `DeployResources.swift`    | `DeployResources`     | `deploy.resources`   |
| `ResourceLimits.swift`     | `ResourceLimits`      | `…resources.limits`  |
| `ResourceReservations.swift`| `ResourceReservations`| `…resources.reservations` |
| `DeviceReservation.swift`  | `DeviceReservation`   | `…reservations.devices[]` |
| `Network.swift` / `ExternalNetwork.swift` | `Network`, `ExternalNetwork` | `networks.<name>` |
| `Volume.swift`  / `ExternalVolume.swift`  | `Volume`,  `ExternalVolume`  | `volumes.<name>`  |
| `Secret.swift`  / `ExternalSecret.swift`  | `Secret`,  `ExternalSecret`  | `secrets.<name>`  |
| `Config.swift`  / `ExternalConfig.swift`  | `Config`,  `ExternalConfig`  | `configs.<name>`  |
| `ServiceSecret.swift` / `ServiceConfig.swift` | `ServiceSecret`, `ServiceConfig` | service-level refs |

Most structs implement custom `init(from:)` to accept multiple YAML shapes
(string vs. array, scalar vs. object). `Service.init(from:)` enforces the
runtime invariant *"a service must have either `image` or `build`"*.

`Service.topoSortConfiguredServices(_:)` does a DFS topological sort over
`depends_on` and detects cycles. It also populates `dependedBy` on each
service for reverse-graph queries.

### 3.2 Commands

All subcommands conform to `AsyncParsableCommand`. There are **19 subcommands**
registered in `Application.swift`:

| Subcommand     | Purpose                                                |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `up`           | Start project containers (topo-sorted, profile-filtered, includes/extends/scale resolved) |
| `down`         | Stop and remove project containers                     |
| `start`        | Start existing stopped project containers              |
| `stop`         | Stop running project containers (reverse topo order)   |
| `restart`      | Stop + start                                           |
| `build`        | Build project images without running                   |
| `ps`           | List project containers (NAME / IMAGE / STATUS / PORTS) |
| `ls`           | List active compose projects on the host               |
| `logs`         | Stream logs from project containers (`-f`, `--tail`)   |
| `pull`         | Pull (or skip-pull / always-pull) project images       |
| `config`       | Print fully-resolved/normalized compose YAML           |
| `run`          | Spawn a one-off container with overrides              |
| `exec`         | Run a command inside an existing project container     |
| `kill`         | Send a signal to project containers (default `SIGKILL`) |
| `rm`           | Remove stopped project containers                      |
| `create`       | Provision containers without starting (capability-probed) |
| `watch`        | Polling-based file monitor honoring `develop.watch[]`  |
| `top`          | Shell out to `container exec <id> ps -ef` per running project container |
| `port`         | Resolve `<service> <private-port>` against `service.ports` |
| `events`       | 1s-polling synthetic event stream (create/start/stop/die/destroy) |
| `push`         | Shell out to `container image push <image>` per service |
| `version`      | Print tool version                                      |

`up` performs:
1. Locate compose file (`-f`, then `compose.yml` / `compose.yaml` / `docker-compose.yml` / `docker-compose.yaml`).
2. `DockerCompose.loadAndMerge(...).resolvingExtends()` — recursively merge `include:` files (cycle-detected) and resolve `extends:`.
3. Load `.env` file (`process.envFile` first, else `./.env`).
4. Derive project name (explicit `name:` field, else CWD basename).
5. Filter services by `--profile` (or `COMPOSE_PROFILES` env). Topo-sort by `dependsOn`.
6. Expand `service.scale > 1` into N named replicas.
7. Stop + remove existing containers.
8. Create top-level networks (driver / IPAM `--subnet` honored where Apple `container` accepts).
9. Create local hard-link directories for top-level named volumes (warn for non-`local` drivers).
10. For each service: wait on **per-dep `condition`** before starting (Phase 1.4), pull/build image (`pull_policy`-aware), assemble argv via per-concern `*Args.build` builders, spawn as a `Task`, then `waitUntilServiceIsRunning`, then resolve service-name → container-IP in env.
11. If not detached, block forever.

`down` calls `ContainerClient.stop()` (and `delete()` for `up`'s tear-down) for every container matching `<project>-<service>`.

`build` re-uses the same YAML→model pipeline and invokes
`Application.BuildCommand` with the full set of build sub-features (target,
dockerfile_inline, cache_from/to, labels, network, ssh, secrets, platforms,
shm_size).

### 3.3 Per-concern argv builders (Phase 1.1 split)

`ComposeUp.configService` no longer inlines argv emission. Each concern is in
its own extension file under `Sources/Container-Compose/Commands/`:

| File | Owns |
| ---- | ---- |
| `Compose+ArgsBase.swift` | `ArgsContext` struct |
| `Compose+ArgsLifecycle.swift` | platform, name, detach, stdin/tty, init, stop_signal/grace_period, runtime, restart-warn, logging |
| `Compose+ArgsSecurity.swift` | user, privileged, read_only, cap_add/drop, security_opt, userns_mode, group_add |
| `Compose+ArgsResource.swift` | cpus, memory, mem_*, pids/shm/oom/cpu_*, ulimits, gpus, blkio_config |
| `Compose+ArgsNetworking.swift` | ports, networks (list+map+aliases), hostname, dns, extra_hosts, domainname, expose, mac_address, network_mode, ipc, pid, uts |
| `Compose+ArgsStorage.swift` | working_dir, tmpfs, devices, sysctls, warn-skip volumes_from/storage_opt/device_cgroup_rules |
| `Compose+ArgsLabels.swift` | service.labels |
| `Compose+ConfigsAndSecrets.swift` | service-level configs/secrets bind-mounts |
| `Compose+Wait.swift` | `waitForCondition(_:condition:)` for depends_on object form |

Each builder takes `ArgsContext` and returns `[String]`. Side-effects (volume
dir creation, env merging) stay inline in `configService`.

### 3.3 Helpers (`Helper Functions.swift`)

Re-used across commands:
- `loadEnvFile(path:)` — robust `.env` parser (skips comments, blanks).
- `resolveVariable(_:with:)` — `${VAR}`, `${VAR:-default}`, `${VAR:?error}`.
- `resolvedPath(for:relativeTo:)` — handles `~`, relative, absolute.
- `deriveProjectName(cwd:)` — sanitizes CWD basename for container names.
- `composePortToRunArg(_:)` — Compose port spec → `container run -p` argv.

## 4. Coverage vs. compose-spec

The full feature-coverage matrix lives in **`coverage.html`** at the repo
root (canonical source of truth). The inline JSON data is also extracted
to `coverage.json` by `scripts/regen-coverage.sh` for downstream tooling.
`coverage.json` is gitignored — regenerate it locally if your tooling
needs it.

Current totals (post-CHAOS-1299 + coverage hygiene sweep):

| Status      | Count   | %     |
| ----------- | ------- | ----- |
| Implemented | **135** | 69.6% |
| Partial     | 54      | 27.8% |
| Missing     | 5       | 2.6%  |
| **Total**   | **194** | 100%  |

The remaining "partial" and "missing" rows fall into three buckets:
1. **Apple-container-runtime limitations** — e.g. healthcheck
   condition can't read a true health status because
   `ContainerSnapshot` doesn't surface a `health` field; `--restart`
   isn't accepted by `container run`; `compose logs
   --since/--timestamps` and the event-stream API lack
   `ContainerClient` surface.
2. **Swarm-only / orchestrator features** — `deploy.replicas`,
   `deploy.update_config`, `deploy.rollback_config`,
   `deploy.placement`, `endpoint_mode`, `mode`. Decoded as stubs.
3. **Newer compose-spec or deprecated features** — `top.models`,
   `service.models`, `service.provider` (newer LLM/AI plumbing,
   decode pending); `service.external_links`, `service.links`
   (deprecated, won't implement).

The 5 remaining `miss` rows:

| Row | Group | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `top.models`, `service.models`, `service.provider` | top / service | Newer spec, not yet decoded |
| `service.external_links`, `service.links` | service | Deprecated; intentional skip |

### Anchor section: `depends_on` (compose-spec.json L277-L310)

End-to-end status:

- ✅ list form (`depends_on: [db, redis]`) — `DependsOn.list(...)` factory
- ✅ object form (`depends_on: {db: {condition: service_healthy}}`) — `DependsOn.entries`
- ✅ `condition: service_started` — `waitForCondition(.serviceStarted)`
- ⚠️ `condition: service_healthy` — gated, but underlying fallback to `.running`
  (TODO: true health when ContainerSnapshot exposes it)
- ⚠️ `condition: service_completed_successfully` — gated to `.stopped`,
  no exit-code verification (TODO)
- ✅ `required: true|false` — `DependsOnEntry.required` controls whether
  errors propagate or are warned
- ⚠️ `restart` — parsed on `DependsOnEntry`; pending Apple container's
  restart manager exposure

---

## 5. Testing

Two test targets, both using **Swift Testing** (`@Test` macro, not XCTest).

### Static (parsing / unit / argv-shape)
`Tests/Container-Compose-StaticTests/` — **53 files, 724 `@Test` cases**.
Covers schema decoding, command flag parsing, per-concern argv emission,
and runtime seams (`RecordingRunner`, `RecordingContainerClientProvider`).
Categorical breakdown:

- **Compose-schema parsing**: `DockerComposeParsingTests`, `*ParsingTests`,
  `BuildConfigurationTests`, `HealthcheckConfigurationTests`,
  `NetworkConfigurationTests`, `DeployStubsParsingTests`,
  `ServicePropertiesParsingTests`, `DependsOnParsingTests`, etc.
- **Per-concern argv builders**: `LifecycleArgsTests`, `SecurityArgsTests`,
  `ResourceArgsTests`, `NetworkArgsTests`, `StorageArgsTests`,
  `LabelsArgsTests`, `LoggingArgsTests`, `GpusBlkioTests`.
- **Subcommand parsing + argv shape**: `Compose<Name>ParsingTests`
  + `RuntimeArgvTests` + per-command `Compose<Name>RuntimeArgvTests`.
- **Helpers**: `HelperFunctionsTests`, `EnvironmentVariableTests`,
  `EnvFileLoadingTests`, `WaitForConditionTests`,
  `PreSubcommandFlagPromotionTests`, `LineBufferTests`,
  `ProfilesTests`, `ScaleTests`, `IncludeTests`, `ExtendsTests`.

`TestHelpers/` provides:
- `DockerComposeYamlFiles.swift` — shared fixture YAML
- `RecordingRunner.swift` — captures `container <…>` argv for assertion
- `RecordingContainerClientProvider.swift` — synthetic `ContainerClient`
- `RuntimeAvailability.swift` — gates dynamic tests off when Apple
  `container` is not installed (CI-safe)

### Dynamic (integration against `container` runtime)
`Tests/Container-Compose-DynamicTests/` — 11 `@Test` cases:
- `ComposeUpTests`, `ComposeDownTests`, `ComposeBuildTests`

Dynamic tests self-skip on hosts without the Apple `container` runtime
(via `RuntimeAvailability.isAvailable()`), so `swift test` is safe to
run in CI. Verify locally with the runtime installed before committing
schema changes that ripple into `up`/`down`/`build`.

### Known CI flake
`swiftpm-testing-helper` occasionally exits with `signal code 10`
(SIGBUS) **after** `Test Suite 'All tests' passed` is reported. Cause
is upstream Swift Testing harness, not project code. Merge queue's
`grouping_strategy: ALLGREEN` retries help absorb it; long-term fix
likely requires `swift test --no-parallel` or `@Suite(.serialized)` on
a culprit suite (TBD).

### Sample compose files
- `Sample Compose Files/Healthchecked Redis/docker-compose.yaml` — single-service,
  healthcheck (string form), restart policy, volume, port.

## 6. Conventions for Agents

- **Branch first.** Always create a branch before edits — and a worktree if
  you're parallelizing with other agents.
- **Parallel-safe scopes.** `Codable Structs/`, `Commands/`, and `Tests/` are
  largely independent — multiple agents can work in different folders without
  conflicts. Schema changes (Service, DockerCompose) ripple everywhere; serialize.
- **Tests before edits.** Add a Swift Testing `@Test` for any new schema field
  or behavior in the matching `Tests/Container-Compose-StaticTests/<Topic>Tests.swift`.
- **Build invariants.** A `Service` must have `image` *or* `build` — the
  decoder asserts this. Don't bypass the assertion; add a fixture if you're
  testing edge cases.
- **Decoder shape-tolerance.** Many fields accept both string-and-array (e.g.
  `command`, `entrypoint`, `depends_on` list-form). Preserve this when
  extending.
- **`#warning` / "Detected, But Not Supported".** The codebase uses
  `#warning(...)` and `print("X Detected, But Not Supported")` to flag known
  gaps. When you implement one of these, remove the warning and add a test.
- **Don't break the topo sort.** `Service.topoSortConfiguredServices` is on
  the hot path of `up`. Cycle detection there must keep throwing.
- **Commits.** Small, focused commits. Rebuild with `make build` and run
  `swift test` before pushing.

### High-leverage open work

CHAOS-1299 closed the four missing CLI subcommands (`top`, `port`,
`events`, `push`). Recent B-sweep PRs (#19–#23) decoded a pile of
service/healthcheck/deploy/secret/config niche fields. Remaining work
sorts into three tiers:

#### Tier 1 — Actionable now (no upstream dependencies)

1. **Coverage-row hygiene** — `compose watch` and `service.ulimits` are
   marked `miss` but actually implemented. Audit + flip to `ok`.
2. **CI flake fix** — investigate `swiftpm-testing-helper` signal-10
   exit. Likely needs `@Suite(.serialized)` on the offending suite or
   `swift test --no-parallel` in CI.
3. **DRY pull helpers** — `ComposePull` and `ComposeCreate` each carry
   a private copy of `pullImage`. Lift to a shared internal helper.
4. **Cross-file `extends`** (`extends: { service: foo, file: ./other.yml }`)
   currently warn-and-skips. Reuse `loadAndMerge`-style cross-file
   loading to actually pull `foo` from another file.
5. **FSEvents-based watcher** — `compose watch` currently polls.
   Upgrade to `FSEventStream` for low-latency change detection.
6. **Newer-spec decoding** — decode `top.models`, `service.models`,
   `service.provider` (LLM/AI provider plumbing). Parse-only; runtime
   wiring optional.

#### Tier 2 — Upstream-dependent (apple/container)

These need a Swift API addition in `apple/container` first; the
`mcrich23/container` fork is *ahead* of apple/container, not where new
platform features come from.

7. **True `service_healthy` enforcement** — needs `health` field on
   `ContainerSnapshot`. Currently `Compose+Wait.swift` falls back to
   `.running` with a one-time warning.
8. **Exit-code verification for `service_completed_successfully`** —
   `ContainerSnapshot` doesn't expose exit code; we wait for `.stopped`
   only.
9. **`restart` policy actually applied** — `container run` doesn't
   accept `--restart`. Needs a higher-level restart manager in the
   container package.
10. **`compose logs --since` / `--timestamps`** — parsed but
    `ContainerClient.logs(id:)` lacks those parameters.
11. **`compose events` native streaming** — currently 1s polling
    fallback. Needs an event-stream API on `ContainerClient`.
12. **`compose run` / `exec` standard flag names** — currently use
    `--run-env`/`--exec-env`/etc. to avoid clashes with
    `Flags.Process`. When `Flags.Process` allows opt-out, switch to
    standard `-e`/`-u`/`-w`.

#### Tier 3 — Scope-deferred / won't-do

13. **Swarm-only deploy fields** — `replicas`, `update_config`,
    `rollback_config`, `placement`, `endpoint_mode`, `mode`. Decoded as
    stubs; runtime semantics belong to a different orchestrator class.
14. **Deprecated fields** — `links`, `external_links`, `volumes_from`.
    Either decoded as no-op or intentionally skipped.

## 7. Build & Run

```sh
# Build
make build           # release config, copies binary to .build/release/

# Install globally
make install         # symlinks into /usr/local/bin (sudo may be required)

# Run tests
swift test                                  # both targets
swift test --filter Container-Compose-StaticTests  # parsing only

# Use locally
.build/release/container-compose up -f path/to/docker-compose.yml
```

CI lives under `.github/workflows/`. Treat any failure there as blocking.

## Linear

This project uses **Linear** for issue tracking.
Default team: **CHAOS**

### Creating Issues

```bash
# Create a simple issue
linear issues create "Fix login bug" --team CHAOS --priority high

# Create with full details and dependencies
linear issues create "Add OAuth integration" \
  --team CHAOS \
  --description "Integrate Google and GitHub OAuth providers" \
  --parent CHAOS-100 \
  --depends-on CHAOS-99 \
  --labels "backend,security" \
  --estimate 5

# List and view issues
linear issues list
linear issues get CHAOS-123
```

### Fetching private Linear images

`uploads.linear.app` URLs in issue descriptions require authentication.
Do **NOT** use `WebFetch` or `curl` — they will 401.

```bash
linear attachments download "https://uploads.linear.app/..."
# → /tmp/linear-img-<hash>.png
```

Then `Read` that path to view the image.
