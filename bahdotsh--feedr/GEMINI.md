# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Feedr is a terminal-based RSS/Atom feed reader built with Rust, using ratatui/crossterm for the TUI. It supports feed management, categorization, filtering, dual themes, OPML import, auto-refresh with per-domain rate limiting, feed auto-discovery from HTML pages, configurable keybindings, mouse support, a help overlay, newsboat-style external-command hooks (macros and `exec_on_new`), and Mozilla-Readability full-text article extraction.

## Build & Development Commands

```bash
cargo build --release          # Build optimized binary (LTO enabled)
cargo run --release             # Run the app
cargo test --verbose            # Run all tests
cargo test --all-features --verbose  # Run tests with all features
cargo test <test_name>          # Run a single test
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings  # Lint (CI-strict)
cargo fmt --all                 # Format code

```

MSRV: 1.75.0. CI runs tests on stable, beta, and 1.75.0.

## Architecture

**Single-threaded synchronous TUI** — no async runtime. The main loop in `tui.rs` polls for keyboard events, mutates state, then renders.

### Core modules

- **`app.rs`** — `App` struct holding all application state. All state mutations (feed ops, filtering, categorization, persistence) happen through its methods. This is the largest and most central file.
- **`tui.rs`** — Terminal setup/teardown, main event loop (`run_app`), feed refresh logic, and external-command runners (`suspend_for_command`, `spawn_detached`, `drain_macro_steps`, `collect_exec_on_new`/`flush_exec_on_new`). `TerminalRestoreGuard` (RAII) re-enters alt-screen + raw mode + mouse capture on drop so a panic in a child invocation can't leave the terminal broken.
- **`events.rs`** — All keyboard and mouse event handling (`handle_events`). Input dispatches based on `View` × `InputMode` enums. Hosts the macro engine (`dispatch_action`, `run_macro`, `build_pipe_invocation`, `build_exec_invocation`). Separated from `tui.rs` for maintainability.
- **`keybindings.rs`** — `KeyAction` enum, default keybinding map, key string parsing, config-driven keybinding overrides via `[keybindings]` TOML section, and newsboat-style macro parsing (`MacroStep`, `MacroBinding`, `MacroOptions`, `parse_macro_string`).
- **`feed.rs`** — Data models (`Feed`, `FeedItem`, `FeedCategory`), RSS/Atom parsing via `feed-rs`, and HTML feed auto-discovery via `scraper`.
- **`config.rs`** — XDG-compliant config loading/saving (`~/.config/feedr/config.toml`). Includes `keybindings: HashMap<String, toml::Value>` for custom key overrides, `[hooks]` (`exec_on_new`), `[macros]`, and `[macro_options]`. Auto-generates defaults on first run.
- **`config_cli.rs`** — CLI subcommand handler for `feedr config list/get/set`.
- **`config_tui.rs`** — Interactive TUI config editor (`feedr config --tui`).
- **`config_ui.rs`** — Rendering for the TUI config editor.
- **`main.rs`** — CLI arg parsing (clap) and OPML import entry point.

### UI modules (`src/ui/`)

- **`mod.rs`** — Rendering dispatch, `ColorScheme` with two themes (dark cyberpunk, light zen), and shared layout helpers.
- **`dashboard.rs`** — Dashboard view with filters, search, and preview pane.
- **`feed_list.rs`** — Feed list and hierarchical tree view rendering.
- **`feed_items.rs`** — Feed items list rendering.
- **`detail.rs`** — Article detail view with scrolling and link extraction.
- **`starred.rs`** — Starred articles view.
- **`categories.rs`** — Category management UI.
- **`summary.rs`** — Session summary ("What's New") screen.
- **`modals.rs`** — Error, input, filter, link overlay, and help overlay modals.
- **`utils.rs`** — Shared rendering utilities.

### Key patterns

- **View + InputMode dispatch**: Event handling in `events.rs` matches on `(app.view, key.code)` nested inside `app.input_mode`. When adding new keybindings, place them in the correct View/InputMode branch.
- **Configurable keybindings**: All remappable actions are defined as `KeyAction` variants in `keybindings.rs`. The `KeyBindingMap` is built from defaults merged with user overrides from `config.keybindings`. Event handlers use `app.keybindings` to check matches instead of hardcoding key codes. Some structural keys (Tab/Shift+Tab, number keys, text input, category/filter mode keys) are intentionally hardcoded.
- **`q` key goes back, not quit**: `q` navigates back one view (e.g., FeedItems → FeedList → Dashboard). Only quits from Dashboard. `Ctrl+Q` is the universal quit from any view. The `Ctrl+Q` check is a guard at the top of `handle_events`, before the `match app.input_mode` block.
- **Feed auto-discovery**: When a user adds a non-RSS URL, `feed.rs` fetches the HTML and uses `scraper` to find `<link>` tags with RSS/Atom types. If feeds are found, a confirmation dialog lets the user pick which to subscribe to.
- **Mouse support**: `events.rs` handles `MouseEventKind::Down` (left click to select) and `MouseEventKind::ScrollDown`/`ScrollUp` for navigation.
- **Dashboard items**: `dashboard_items: Vec<(feed_idx, item_idx)>` is a derived index into `feeds`, rebuilt by `apply_filters()` whenever filters change.
- **Data persistence**: Saved to `~/.local/share/feedr/feedr_data.json` — bookmarks, categories, and read item tracking.
- **Error display is modal**: When `app.error` is `Some`, the keypress is consumed to dismiss it (not passed through to handlers). See the guard at the top of `handle_events`.
- **Rate limiting**: `last_domain_fetch: HashMap` throttles per-domain HTTP requests.
- **Authenticated feeds**: `feed_headers: HashMap<String, HashMap<String, String>>` in `App` maps feed URLs to custom HTTP headers. Built from `config.default_feeds` entries that have `headers`. Passed to `Feed::fetch_url()` at all fetch call sites.
- **Compact mode**: `app.compact` bool is updated each frame by `update_compact_mode(terminal_height)`. Rendering in `ui.rs` branches on `app.compact` for layout, title bar, help bar, and dashboard item format. Controlled by `config.ui.compact_mode` (`Auto`/`Always`/`Never`). Dialog modals use `centered_rect_with_min()` to enforce minimum dimensions regardless of compact mode.
- **External-command hooks (macros + `exec_on_new`)**: Commands are run **without a shell**. Templates are tokenized once at config load via `shlex`, then `expand_argv_template` substitutes `%X` placeholders into individual argv tokens (no re-expansion), so feed content cannot break out of an argument. The macro engine queues steps into `app.pending_macro_steps` from `events.rs` and the TUI loop drains them in `tui.rs::drain_macro_steps` — drain lives at the loop level because `pipe-to` needs the terminal handle to suspend the TUI. Chains halt on the first step error (tracked via a `pre_error` guard so a stale `app.error` doesn't spuriously abort). The macro prefix (default `,`) is checked at the top of `handle_key_event` and only when `input_mode == Normal`, so text-input modes are not disturbed; an idle prefix times out via the existing success-message timeout.
- **`exec_on_new` crash semantics**: AT-MOST-ONCE. `flush_exec_on_new` persists the `seen_items` / `feeds_seeded` sets *before* spawning any child, so a kill mid-fire loses a notification rather than re-firing on the next launch. `mark_feed_seen` only flips `feeds_seeded` on a fetch that returned items (transiently-empty first fetches don't seed), and the first observation of a feed seeds the seen-set silently to avoid a firehose. Children are spawned detached with stdio nulled; a reaper thread waits on each so they don't linger as zombies. The seen-set is pruned in `remove_current_feed` to prevent monotonic growth across feed churn. **Single-shared mark per feed**: `mark_feed_seen` is hoisted to the feed-drain call site in `tui.rs` (gated on `exec_on_new_template.is_some() || fulltext_feeds.contains(&feed.url)`) so multiple consumers (currently exec_on_new and fulltext) share one mark per feed arrival — calling it twice would double-mark and the second consumer would see an empty `newly_seen` list.
- **Full-text extraction**: `feed::extract_article` fetches an article URL with the existing `reqwest::blocking::Client` and runs Mozilla Readability via the `dom_smoothie` crate. **Sync, no tokio.** Per-feed `Authorization`/auth headers are intentionally NOT forwarded to article URLs (they're third-party hosts — propagating would be a credential leak). The response body is read via `Response::take(FULLTEXT_MAX_BYTES+1).read_to_end(...)` so peak allocation is hard-capped at ~5 MB regardless of what the server sends, and the response charset is honored (`Content-Type charset=` → `<meta charset>` sniff → UTF-8) via `encoding_rs` so non-UTF8 pages don't mojibake. Each extraction runs on a `std::thread::spawn` worker wrapped in `catch_unwind` (so a `dom_smoothie` panic on hostile HTML surfaces as `Failed("…panicked…")` instead of stranding the slot on `Pending` forever). The TUI loop maintains a `Arc<AtomicUsize>` `extract_inflight` budget capped at `EXTRACTION_MAX_INFLIGHT = 4`; queued requests beyond that budget — or whose domain was last fetched less than `refresh_rate_limit_delay` ago — are pushed back onto `pending_extraction_requests` to retry on the next loop tick. State lives only in `App::extracted: HashMap<item_id, ExtractionState>` (`Pending` / `Ready(ExtractedArticle)` / `Failed(String)`) — **in-memory only**, never persisted; LRU-capped at `EXTRACTED_CACHE_CAP = 500` with insertion-order tracking via `extracted_order: VecDeque<String>`. The cap is **hard**: `insert_extraction` always evicts the deque head when full, and `record_extraction_result` rejects results for slots that aren't currently `Pending` (so a late worker for an evicted / removed id is dropped rather than resurrecting dead state). `Shift+F` (`KeyAction::FetchFullText`) toggles between summary and extracted text when `Ready`, queues a new request when absent, and re-queues on `Failed` (so the user can retry). Per-feed `fulltext = true` in config auto-extracts newly-seen items on refresh (same `mark_feed_seen` "newly seen" semantics as `exec_on_new` — first fetch seeds silently, no firehose); the auto path additionally filters via `feed::is_safe_auto_url` (http/https only, rejects RFC1918 / loopback / link-local / CGNAT / multicast / 6to4 / NAT64 / `localhost`-style names) to prevent a hostile feed from probing internal hosts. The auto path's worker also uses `Feed::build_safe_redirect_client`, whose `redirect::Policy::custom` re-runs `is_safe_auto_url` on every hop, so a public-looking `<link>` that 302s into an internal target is rejected mid-chain instead of slipping past the upfront URL check. Each `ExtractionRequest` carries a `safe_redirects` flag (true for auto, false for manual `Shift+F`); the spawn loop picks the matching client per-request. Manual `Shift+F` bypasses both the URL allowlist and the safe-redirect client (it's the user's explicit action, same trust model as opening the article in a browser). The spawn loop also gates each pop on the slot still being `Pending`, so requests whose `extracted` entry was evicted by LRU or pruned by `remove_current_feed` get dropped without spawning a worker, and uses `std::thread::Builder::new().spawn()` so an OS thread-creation failure releases the inflight slot and re-queues the request instead of crashing the TUI. The detail-view lookup uses `current_article_indices()` (same resolver as the action handler) so they stay in lockstep. Extracted entries are pruned alongside `seen_items` in `remove_current_feed` via the `remove_extraction(&id)` helper.

## Commit Conventions

Uses **conventional commits** — `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, `perf:`, `test:`, `chore:`, `build:`, `style:`. Changelog is generated by git-cliff (`cliff.toml`).

## Testing

Integration tests live in `/tests/integration_test.rs` and test feed parsing against real URLs. Unit tests are inline in `config.rs`, `app.rs`, `keybindings.rs`, `events.rs`, and `tui.rs` (the macro-drain tests use a `TestBackend` to avoid needing a real TTY).
