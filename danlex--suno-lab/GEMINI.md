# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

> ## ⚠ TOP-PRIORITY CONTRACT — READ FIRST
> **No vanilla / one-off bash or `python3 -c` for ANY recurring cycle step. The user does not approve it.**
> If a step is deterministic and recurs, it belongs in a committed reusable script under `scripts/` (write one if missing). This includes labelled diagnostic compounds (`echo "—status—"; git status …`, `ls | grep | sort`, chained `&&` shell pipelines for inspection, `python3 -c "import json; …"`). The full rule is below under "Scripting discipline (contract — non-negotiable)" — every cycle step MUST satisfy it.

## Project Overview

This is a **Suno AI music generation prompt engineering workspace**. The goal is to craft, iterate on, and execute Suno prompts via browser automation (Claude-in-Chrome) against `suno.com/create`.

Suno generates complete songs (vocals + instruments + lyrics) from text prompts in under 60 seconds. Current model is **v5.5** (March 2026).

## Suno Prompt Anatomy

We use **Custom Mode** exclusively at `suno.com/create`. Fields:

| Field | Limit | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| **Style** | 1,000 chars | Genre, mood, tempo, instruments, vocal style |
| **Lyrics** | 1,000 chars | Exact lyrics with structural metatags |
| **Title** | 100 chars | Song name |
| **Instrumental** | toggle | Remove vocals |

**Style prompt approach:** v5.5 prefers conversational flowing descriptions over comma-separated tags. Write sentences, not lists: "Sublime neoclassical orchestral vocalise with monumental cinematic grandeur..." not "neoclassical, orchestral, sublime, cinematic." Aim for 850-950 chars to leave room for negative prompts and key/BPM at the end.

### Metatags (embedded in lyrics)

Structural: `[Intro]`, `[Verse]`, `[Verse 1]`, `[Pre-Chorus]`, `[Chorus]`, `[Post-Chorus]`, `[Bridge]`, `[Hook]`, `[Interlude]`, `[Break]`, `[Outro]`, `[End]`, `[Fade Out]`, `[Big Finish]`, `[Short Instrumental Intro]`

Performance: `[Whispered]`, `[Spoken Word]`, `[Belted]`, `[Male singer]`, `[Harmonized chorus]`

Instrument/FX: `[Acoustic guitar]`, `[Synth pads]`, `[Jazz saxophone solo]`, `[Silence]`, `[Applause]`

Ad-libs use parentheses inline: `(oh yeah)`, `(hey!)`

### Prompt Best Practices
- Front-load style with genre and mood (survives truncation)
- Write descriptions, not commands: "Upbeat pop track with..." not "Create an upbeat..."
- No artist names — use genre/era descriptors instead
- Use negative prompts: "no autotune", "no heavy bass"
- Keep lyrics 8-12 lines per generation to avoid timing errors
- Use `[End]` as standalone section to signal endings
- BPM and timestamps work: "120 BPM", "lyrics begin at 0:15"
- Expect 8-15 iterations to nail a prompt — small changes matter
- v5.5 prefers conversational style descriptions over comma-separated tags
- **Silence before climax** is the #1 frisson trigger — build to 80%, drop to near-silence, then deliver climax that exceeds expectations (use `[Silence]` metatag)
- **Key modulation** at climax: half-step up (e.g., D Major → Eb Major) after silence = goosebump multiplier
- **Glass harmonica** creates spatial disorientation (1-4 kHz, brain can't locate sound) — more ethereal than crystal bowls
- **Three-layer instrument control**: genre anchor + specify instruments + negative prompts (+ Exclude styles field)
- Avoid words that trigger wrong genres: "Dune"/"desert" triggers Arabic, "epic"/"massive" triggers rock/drums
- Always verify style is under 1000 chars BEFORE submitting — count characters, don't estimate

## Browser Automation

Songs are generated via Chrome automation at `suno.com/create`. The UI flow:

1. Navigate to `suno.com/create`
2. Select **Advanced** tab (top-left) — this is Custom mode
3. Fill **Lyrics** and **Style** fields
4. Expand **More Options** → set Exclude styles, Vocal Gender
5. Fill **Song Title (Optional)** field (below More Options)
6. Click **Create** → generates 2 versions
7. Listen, then optionally Extend/Edit/Crop/Replace

Key URLs:
- Create: `suno.com/create`
- Song: `suno.com/song/{UUID}`

## Skill: `/suno`

Run `/suno` (or `/suno prompts/some-file.yaml`) to submit a prompt to Suno via Chrome browser automation. The skill reads the YAML file, navigates to `suno.com/create`, fills Custom mode fields, and clicks Create.

All prompt content comes from the user — the skill never generates or modifies prompts on its own.

## Project Structure

```
.claude/skills/suno/  # /suno skill for browser automation
prompts/              # Saved prompt experiments (YAML files)
experiments/          # Logs and notes from generation sessions
scripts/              # Helper scripts for prompt generation
```

## Autonomous Generation Cycle (every 10 minutes)

The project runs an autonomous generation cycle **every 10 minutes** (6/hour). Each cycle:

1. **Research** — WebSearch for one rotating topic (new instruments, genre fusions, frisson techniques, film scoring trends) AND review what's currently topping Suno's most-listened charts to read the *signal* (genre, structure, energy, hooks, production) that is resonating right now.
2. **Create** — Write a new, **original** YAML prompt that applies the research signal with one meaningful change. We study what's working on the charts as inspiration; we do NOT copy other creators' lyrics or styles and republish them. (Remixing is only acceptable on songs explicitly marked remixable by their creator, with substantial changes.)
3. **Submit** — Use `/suno` or browser automation to submit to Suno at `suno.com/create`
4. **Publish** — Publish both generated clips **publicly** as soon as they're ready (runbook step 6b).
5. **Save** — Rebuild website (`python3 scripts/build_site.py`), commit, and push to git

### Titling rule (non-negotiable)
**Every song title must be exactly ONE word.** No spaces, no multi-word titles. Prefer evocative single words. Verify the title is a single token before submitting.

### Language rule (non-negotiable)
**Lyrics must be in English or French only — no other languages.** No Korean, Japanese, Spanish, Pidgin/Yoruba, Latin, etc. Instrumental songs and wordless vocables are fine. The title may be an English or French word (single word per the Titling rule). Verify every lyric line is English or French before submitting.

### After each cycle, always:
Run the reusable close-out script — do **not** hand-type the steps:
- `python3 scripts/finish_cycle.py --version <N> --clips <uuid1> <uuid2> [--technique ... --key ... --bpm ... --trio ...]`
  - It registers clip UUIDs in `docs/suno_urls.json`, appends the `evolution.md` row, rebuilds the site (`build_site.py`), stages only the cycle's files (never `git add -A`), commits, and pushes.

### Scripting discipline (contract — non-negotiable)
- **No vanilla / one-off script execution. The user does not approve it — full stop.** Do not run ad-hoc inline `bash` (incl. `ls | grep | sort`, `echo` labels, heredocs, chained `&&` pipelines for inspection) or `python3 -c "..."` snippets to perform ANY deterministic, recurring cycle step. This explicitly includes: **computing the next version number**, refreshing the novelty surface, registering URLs, building the site, logging, committing/pushing, inspecting prompt/JSON/YAML state, AND **deciding draft-vs-resume** (whether the latest YAML is uncommitted).
- Every deterministic, repeatable step MUST live in a **reusable, parametrized script** under `scripts/` and be invoked as `python3 scripts/<name>.py …`. Current entrypoints:
  - `scripts/cycle_start.py` — computes the latest/next version from `prompts/`, refreshes `experiments/novelty_surface.json`, AND emits `recommended_action ∈ {"resume_submit","draft_new"}` + `recommended_version` so the orchestrator never needs `git status`/`ls` to decide. Use this instead of any shell composition.
  - `scripts/novelty_surface.py` — regenerates the novelty surface.
  - `scripts/finish_cycle.py` — full save+publish close-out (URLs, evolution row, build, stage, commit, push).
  - `scripts/build_site.py` — rebuilds `docs/`.
- If a needed deterministic step has **no script yet, WRITE one** (parametrized, reusable, committed via the next `finish_cycle.py`) and run that — never improvise a one-off, even "just this once."
- The ONLY acceptable raw `bash` is a **single, uncomposed, throwaway** diagnostic that no script could sensibly own (e.g. `ps aux | grep …` while debugging a stuck process, a bare `git status` to confirm the working tree). Composing it with `echo` labels, chaining via `&&` with other inspections, or wrapping it in a shell prologue is the violation.

#### BANNED — explicit examples (these are vanilla cycle work; do not run them)
- `ls prompts/ | grep -oE 'v[0-9]+' | sort -V | tail -1`
- `echo "=== next version ==="; python3 scripts/cycle_start.py; echo "=== untracked ==="; git status --short prompts/`
- `python3 -c "import json; d=json.load(open('docs/suno_urls.json')); print(len(d))"`
- `python3 scripts/cycle_start.py && git status --short prompts/`
- `cat prompts/*-v230.yaml | grep -E '^(style|title|instrumental):'`
- any compound shell that *both* runs a script AND adds an `echo`/`git status`/`ls` for context

#### ALLOWED — these are the only safe shell patterns
- `python3 scripts/cycle_start.py` (the script alone)
- `python3 scripts/finish_cycle.py --version N --clips A B …`
- a bare `git status` or `ps aux | grep <pid>` (single, uncomposed, debugging-only)
- `kill <pid>` (single, uncomposed, debugging a stuck process)

#### When in doubt
Default to writing a new script and running that. The user has repeated this rule multiple times; the failure mode is *always* "I added one little `echo`/`git status` to get context" — that "one little thing" is the violation. If a piece of state is worth observing routinely, it goes in a script.

### Current era: Charts-informed viral (v324+)
The direction is **listenable, viral-ready songs that real people enjoy**, informed by what's currently resonating on Suno. Each cycle reads the most-listened charts for *signal* — genre, song structure, energy curve, hook placement, production polish — and uses that to build an **original** prompt. We do NOT copy other creators' lyrics or styles; studying the charts is research, not appropriation. Vocal songs are welcome (recent viral pivots: Latin sad-trap v324, anime ballad v325, Afro-soul v326, K-pop solo ballad v327). The duration-maximizing instrumental synthesis stack (electronic+orchestra+unusual instruments, silence-before-climax, half-step modulation) remains available but is no longer the default — pick the form that best fits the chart signal for the cycle.

**Hard rules for every song in this era:**
- Title = exactly ONE word (see Titling rule above).
- Lyrics in English or French only (see Language rule above).
- Publish both clips publicly as soon as they render.
- Original work only — no republishing lightly-edited copies of others' songs.

## Prompt File Format

Prompts are stored as YAML in `prompts/`:

```yaml
name: "song-name"
version: 1
style: "genre, mood, instruments..."         # Max 1000 chars — aim for 850-950
title: "Song Title"
lyrics: |
  [Intro]
  ...
  [Verse 1]
  ...
  [Chorus]
  ...
  [End]
instrumental: false
vocal_gender: female                          # Optional: "female" or "male"
exclude_styles: "Arabic, rock, electronic"    # Optional: reinforces negative prompts
notes: "What we're testing with this prompt"
tags: [genre, experiment-name]
```
