```

Rule: `types/` holds pure pydantic data schemas. Anything with logic/behavior
(like `Workspace`, or `BatchIngestJob` in `batch.py`) goes at the package root, not
under `types/`.

**Data carriers are pydantic `BaseModel`s, never `dataclasses`/`NamedTuple`/`TypedDict`.**
One model system across the SDK (validation, `Field(description=...)`, JSON schema, IDE
hints), and pure-data ones live under `types/`. A schema may reference a behavioral model
as a *field type* (e.g. `types/batch.py` embeds `File`), that's fine; it stays pure data
itself. Construct them with keyword args (pydantic rejects positional). Use
`arbitrary_types_allowed` for opaque non-pydantic fields (e.g. `FailedIngest.error: Exception`).

`enums.py` holds hand-curated controlled vocabularies (`FileStatus`, `Role`) used as
model field types. **`StrEnum`, not `Enum`**, members are strings, so `f.status ==
"embedded"` and set-membership keep working without `.value`, and pydantic
serializes them back to plain strings for request bodies. Values mirror the generated
api enums (`StatusEnum`/`RoleEnum`); if the server vocab changes, `make gen-types`
surfaces it and you update `enums.py` by hand. Only enum a field whose full domain is
known, `workspace_type`/`document_upload_method` stay `str` (plain `str` in the schema
too, no documented value set).

## Client

- **Sync only.** `httpx.Client`. No async client until a real event-loop caller needs one, `_request` is the only logic to mirror.
- **One `_request`** does auth header, error mapping (→ raises), and JSON parse. All calls route through it. A 2xx body that isn't JSON → `MalformedResponseError`.
- **Primary verbs** live one-per-file in `verbs/` as mixins (`AskMixin`/`SearchMixin`/`ParseMixin`/`ExtractMixin`) composed onto `LightOn`. Each references `self._request`; the stub on `_VerbClient` (their shared base) makes them type-check in isolation, and `LightOn._request` overrides it at runtime. Keeps `_client.py` to just the transport core. They take explicit typed params and return the generated response models via `model_validate`. `ask`/`search` take `workspaces`/`tags`/`files` (lists of `Workspace`/`Tag`/`File` objects or bare ids; `_ids()` in `utils.py` coerces via duck-typed `.id` → the API's `workspace_id`/`tag_id`/`file_id`; server-side, `file_id` can't combine with `workspace_id`/`tag_id`, and `tag_id` is OR-matched). `tags` additionally accepts **name strings**, resolved through `tag.resolve_ids` (same helper as `File.tag`), so the verb `cast`s `self` to `LightOn` (the mixin `self` is typed `_VerbClient`) to call `Tag.list`; resolution only lists when a name is present. `parse` takes keyword-only `path` XOR `url` (multipart vs JSON body; raises `ValueError` unless exactly one). `extract` takes keyword-only `path` XOR `url` XOR `file` (raises `ValueError` unless exactly one; `path` → multipart, the other two → JSON body) plus a `schema` that is **either a pydantic model class** or a **raw JSON-Schema dict**; returns `ExtractJobResponse`. `file` is an **already-ingested** file (`File` or bare id → the API's `file_id`, coerced by `_id()` in `utils.py`, the scalar sibling of `_ids()`), no re-upload; `File` is imported under `TYPE_CHECKING` only, so the annotation costs no import cycle. The multipart `file` **part** still isn't in the OpenAPI schema (`ExtractRequest` models `document`/`file_id`/`schema`/`options`) but the endpoint accepts it, verified by curl; on multipart, `schema`/`options` ride as JSON-encoded form fields alongside it. Note the name collision: the `file=` **param** means file_id, the multipart part is what `path=` sends. `ask` takes the same `schema` (pydantic class or dict) and sends it as the API's `response_format` for structured output; the answer then comes back as JSON **text** in `AskResponse.answer` (the response model is unchanged), and the SDK deliberately does **not** parse it back, callers do `Model.model_validate_json(resp.answer)`, since a model class is only one of the two accepted inputs and re-validating would make the return type depend on which one was passed. Schema handling (in `utils.py`, `as_json_schema()` is the shared entry point for both verbs): **both inputs end up normalized by `normalize_response_format_json`**: `$defs`/`$ref` inlined (`_inline_refs`), nullable `anyOf` collapsed to `type: [X, "null"]` (`_collapse_nullable`), draft-2020-12 `$schema` marker added (an existing one is kept). A pydantic model goes `model_json_schema()` → normalize (`convert_pydantic_to_response_format_json`); a dict is first validated against the draft-2020-12 meta-schema via `jsonschema` (`validate_response_format_json`, raises `SchemaError`) and then normalized too, **not** passed through as it used to be, because the endpoint 422s on `$ref` and a dict is usually just someone's own `model_json_schema()` call, which carries them (the original bug: nested models only worked via the model-class path). A `#/$defs/` ref with no target raises `SchemaError` rather than a bare `KeyError` from inside the recursion. `jsonschema` is a runtime dep (meta-schema validation is its job; hand-rolling would be flimsy). Ceiling: `_inline_refs` recurses through refs, so a self-referential model would overflow, fine, guided-gen grammars can't express unbounded recursion anyway.
- **Async jobs.** `parse`/`extract` take `mode: ExecMode` (default `ExecMode.SYNC`); `ExecMode.ASYNC` (uppercase members, value `"async"`, and lowercase `async` can't be a member name) sends `options={"async": true}`. `ExecMode` lives in `enums.py` (StrEnum, exported). Async returns a **pollable job handle** (`job.py`): `parse(mode=ASYNC)` → `ParseJob`, `extract(mode=ASYNC)` → `ExtractJob`; sync returns the full response model as before. Each verb has two `@overload`s keyed on `mode: Literal[ExecMode.SYNC|ASYNC]` so callers get the exact return type (`ParseResponse` vs `ParseJob`) instead of the union, the impl signature keeps the `ExecMode` default and the `... | ...Job` return. `Job.poll(page=None)` GETs `<path>/<id>`, absorbs the response onto itself in place (mirrors `_ActiveRecord._absorb`), returns self; `.done` (terminal, `completed_at` set) and `.succeeded` (`status == completed`) read state. `_Job` is a hand-written curated model (`extra="ignore"`) holding the shared plumbing + fields; `ParseJob`/`ExtractJob` subclass it ONLY because `result` differs (`ParseResult.pages` vs `ExtractResult.data`, whose optional fields make a union ambiguous), parse also has `error`. The job binds to the client via the `_VerbClient` transport surface (all it needs is `_request`), not a full `LightOn` (keeps the mixin's `self` assignable without a cast). `JobStatus` (enums.py) has only the documented `pending`/`completed`, the API doesn't publish the failure vocab, so it's for call-site comparison (StrEnum, unknown server values compare unequal, never validated onto the field), and the "poll until `.succeeded`, raise once `.done`" pattern keys off `completed_at`, not a failure string. `_Job.wait(timeout=300, poll=2)` is the auto-wait: a `File.wait`-style poll loop (no webhook exists) that returns self once terminal, raises `TimeoutError` past the deadline and `LightOnError` if `not .succeeded` (detail from `error` when the subclass has one, `getattr`, since only `ParseJob` does). The verbs expose it as `wait=False`/`timeout=300.0` (**same pair as `Workspace.ingest`**), declared **only on the ASYNC `@overload`** so `wait=True` without `mode=ASYNC` is a static error *and* a `ValueError` (sync already blocks); the two negative tests carry a `# ty: ignore[no-matching-overload]`. `wait=True` still returns the job (not the sync response model), so the return-type overloads stay two. No `poll` knob on the verbs, callers who need one use `job.wait(poll=...)`.
- Deferred: tag/content_type/attribute filters, streaming, add the params when needed. Also unwrapped from the current OpenAPI schema: `POST /api/v3/content-types/scope` (`FacetScopeRequest`/`FacetScopeResponse`, LLM scope inference), `WorkspaceTaxonomy` on the workspace list response, and the `ServiceMaintenance503` body (a 503 maps to the generic error today, no dedicated exception).
- **Config object.** Non-essential knobs (`base_url`, `timeout`, `retries`, `transport`) live in `LightOnConfiguration` (pydantic, `arbitrary_types_allowed`). `api_key` stays a direct `LightOn()` arg; falls back to `LIGHTON_API_KEY` env.
- **Retries / rate limiting.** Two layers: `httpx.HTTPTransport(retries=)` handles
  *connection* errors (exp. backoff); `_request` itself handles **HTTP 429**, retries up to
  `rate_limit_retries` (config, default 3), waiting the `Retry-After` header when present
  else exponential-backoff-with-jitter (`_cooldown`). 5xx is **not** retried. An optional
  `_RateGate` (thread-safe min-interval pacer, built when `max_requests_per_minute` is set)
  runs before every request, so the cap holds across *all* endpoints and concurrent threads
  (uploads and polls alike). `max_requests_per_minute` **defaults to 1000** (the API's limit
  for most endpoints), pacing is on out of the box; pass `None` to disable it. 429 cooldown
  is also on by default. Clock/sleep are injectable on `_RateGate` for tests (which pass
  `max_requests_per_minute=None` in the mocked-transport helpers so they don't sleep).
  Multipart `File.create` reads the file into memory (not a streamed handle) so a 429 retry
  can resend the same body, a consumed handle would resend empty.
- **Timeout** default: `connect=5s`, read/write/pool `120s`.
- **URLs**: `base_url = https://api.lighton.ai` (no version), paths carry the full `/api/v3/...`. Keep the version in the path, NOT base_url, a leading-slash path against a base with a path segment triggers httpx's RFC-3986 join replacement.
- `transport=` injection exists so tests use `httpx.MockTransport` with no network.

## Exceptions

`LightOnError` base → `LightOnConnectionError` (transport) and `LightOnAPIError`
(non-2xx, carries `status_code`/`body`) → `AuthenticationError` (401, bad/missing
key), `PermissionDeniedError` (403, authenticated but not allowed, e.g. an endpoint
needing CompanyAdmin; a **sibling** of `AuthenticationError`, not a subclass, so 401
and 403 are caught separately), `NotFoundError` (404), `RateLimitError` (429, also carries `retry_after`, the
`Retry-After` header in seconds via `_retry_after()`, or None; HTTP-date form not
parsed), `ServerError` (5xx).
`exceptions.from_response()` maps status → class. `MalformedResponseError`
(sibling of `LightOnAPIError`, not a subclass), a 2xx body that isn't JSON.

## Resource management: active-record

Chosen pattern (user preference) over a resource-manager. Shared plumbing lives in the
`_ActiveRecord(BaseModel)` base (`_active_record.py`); `Workspace`/`ApiKey`/`File` subclass it.

- **Base provides** the read-side + client-binding: `list`/`get` (classmethods), `refresh`,
  `delete`, `_bind`, `_api`, `_absorb`, `_bound_client`, the `_client` PrivateAttr, and
  `model_config = extra="ignore"`. Subclasses set two ClassVars, `_base` (URL path) and
  `_resource` (name used in the not-persisted `ValueError`).
- **Subclasses provide** only what genuinely diverges: the field schema, `create()`
  (JSON body vs multipart), and `save()` (per-resource PATCH payload).
- Instance methods manage lifecycle: `create(client)` binds the client (`PrivateAttr`);
  `save()`/`refresh()`/`delete()` reuse it. `list`/`get` are classmethods (no instance yet):
  this asymmetry is inherent to active-record.
- `id` is declared `int | str | None` on the base (so base methods type-check) and
  **narrowed per subclass** (`int | None` for Workspace/File, `str | None` for ApiKey).
- Operating on a non-persisted instance (no id/client) raises `ValueError` via `_bound_client()`.
- `list()` follows pagination fully, no silent truncation. It takes `**params` query
  filters (e.g. `File.list(client, workspace_id=…)`); no typed per-resource override
  because `list` is invariant in its element type, a `list[File]`-returning override
  isn't LSP-assignable to the base's `list[Self]`, and ty rejects it.
- `_absorb` overwrites **only fields present in the response**, so one-time/local-only
  fields survive a later `refresh()` (see ApiKey.key, File.path below).
- Curated schema is **independent of the generated api types** (`extra="ignore"` drops noisy response fields). Hand-written models give stable, clean DX; generated ones are ugly and get regenerated.

`ApiKey` follows the same shape. Its one nuance: the plaintext secret (`key`, a
`SecretStr`, read via `.get_secret_value()`, and it won't leak in logs/`repr`) is
returned only by `create()`, once, `_absorb` only overwrites fields present in the
response, so a later `refresh()` (whose response omits `key`) doesn't wipe it.

`File` follows the same shape with two divergences:
- **`create()` is a multipart upload** (`files=`/`data=`), not a JSON body, uploading
  a file to a workspace IS the ingestion. The returned File carries a processing
  `status`; poll it via `refresh()`/`wait()`. There is **no separate ingestion-job
  resource**, the File is the job, so we don't model one.
- `wait()` blocks on a `time.sleep` poll loop until a terminal status (sync SDK; no
  webhook exists). Ingestion is **non-blocking by default**, `Workspace.ingest(file)`
  and `File.create()` return immediately with status `pending`; only `wait=True` /
  `wait()` block. `wait_all()` (module-level, `ThreadPoolExecutor`) waits on many at once.
- `tags` is a `create()` **argument**, not a model field, the response returns tags as
  objects (not the `list[int]` the request takes), which would clash on `_absorb`.
- **`get_by_name(client, name, *, workspace)`** returns `list[File]`, every file with
  that user-facing name in a workspace (`workspace` = object or id). It matches
  **`title`, not `filename`**: the server uniquifies filenames on upload (`report.pdf`
  is stored as `report_20260728_c9be.pdf`), so the uploaded name never matches the
  stored one, while `title` defaults to the filename minus its extension. The API's
  `title` filter is a case-insensitive *partial* match, so it queries the stem and
  narrows to an exact title match client-side. A list, not one file: titles aren't
  unique the way stored filenames are (the same document uploaded twice shares one),
  so callers that need exactly one check the length. Empty on no match, the only
  `ValueError` is a workspace with no id.
- **`tag()`/`untag()`** assign/remove tags post-upload; both accept `Tag` objects, ids,
  **or names** via `tag.resolve_ids(client, ...)`, names are resolved through a single
  `Tag.list()` and an unknown name raises `ValueError` (fail loud, not silent no-tag).
  Resolution only lists when a name is present (ids/objects cost no extra call). `tag()`
  POSTs `{"tags": [...]}` to `/files/<id>/tags` and absorbs the returned file; `untag()`
  DELETEs `/files/<id>/tags/<tag_id>` **one per tag** (no bulk delete). Empty is a no-op
  (add endpoint requires `minItems: 1`). File still models no `tags` field, so neither
  reflects tags locally.

`Tag` is a partial active-record: the API is **list/create/delete only**, there's no
`GET /tags/<id>`, so the inherited `get()`/`refresh()` are overridden to raise
`NotImplementedError` rather than 404 at runtime. `create()` posts name/description/
auto_assign. Tags scope `ask`/`search` via `tags=` (OR-matched `tag_id`).

## Batch ingestion (`batch.py`)

`Workspace.ingest_many(files, *, mode=SYNC, ignore_errors=False, wait=False, timeout,
max_workers, tags)` uploads many paths/Files concurrently. It is **not** active-record and
**not** a server-side job, there's no batch-ingest endpoint; each file is still its own
`File`. It's a thin client-side orchestrator over `File.create` + `File.wait` (threads).
The **behavior** (`BatchIngestJob`, orchestration) lives in `batch.py`; the **result
schemas** (`BatchIngest`, `BatchProgress`, `FailedIngest`) are pydantic models in
`types/batch.py` (re-exported from `lighton` and `lighton.batch`).

- **Validation up front, in the caller's thread** (`_prepare`): every local path is checked
  before *any* upload. Missing paths raise `FileNotFoundError` (sync and async alike, so a bad
  path fails at the call site) unless `ignore_errors`, in which case they land in `failed`.
- **Glob strings.** A **string** item with glob chars (`*?[`) is expanded via
  `glob.glob(recursive=True)` (so `**` works), filtered to existing files; a zero-match
  pattern is treated as a missing path. `File`/`Path` items stay literal. All results are
  deduped by resolved path, so overlapping patterns (or an explicit + globbed dup) upload once.
- **No rate/retry logic here**, that lives in the client (`_request`), so uploads *and* polls
  respect the cap/cooldown uniformly. The client defaults to `max_requests_per_minute=1000`,
  so a batch honors the API's limit out of the box; override on the config if your account differs.
- **`mode` mirrors parse/extract** (`ExecMode`, two `@overload`s): SYNC runs inline and returns
  `BatchIngest(succeeded, failed)`; ASYNC runs in a daemon thread and returns `BatchIngestJob`
  you poll, `progress` (a `BatchProgress` snapshot), live `succeeded`/`failed`, `done`,
  `wait()`. Both paths share `BatchIngestJob._execute`; SYNC just calls it inline (errors
  propagate directly), ASYNC wraps it and stores the error on `_error` for `wait()` to re-raise.
- **`wait`** = wait for ingestion to reach terminal (embedded), not just upload accepted; mirrors
  `File.wait`. `FailedIngest` carries `source`/`error`/`file` (the File when the failure was at
  ingestion, not upload). All mutable state is guarded by one `Lock`; read props return copies.
- ponytail ceilings noted in-code: first error (when not `ignore_errors`) cancels un-started
  work but lets in-flight uploads drain; not a hard cancel.

## Content types & facets

`content_type.py` holds three curated read models (`extra="ignore"`, no active-record,
these aren't CRUD resources): `ContentType` (a taxonomy node: `path`/`code`/`label`/
`attributes`/`children`, self-referential, `ContentType.model_rebuild()` resolves the
forward ref), `Attribute` (shared name/type/value/choices shape, `value` None for a bare
definition), and `Facet` (a content type assigned to a file + its attribute values).
`ContentType.list(client, path=/depth=/include_attributes=/query=)` GETs `/content-types`:
the endpoint returns a **tree** (`{content_types: [...]}`), not paginated, so it can't
use `_ActiveRecord.list`.

`File` classification (all via `POST /files/<id>/facets` with an `action`): `classify`/
`unclassify` (assign/remove a content type, T2), `set_attribute`/`clear_attribute` (an
attribute value under an assigned type, T3), each accepting a `ContentType` or a path
string (one `_facet(action, ct, **extra)` helper builds the body). `facets()` GETs the
file's assigned types as `list[Facet]`. Like tags, File models no facet fields locally.

If adding new resources, subclass `_ActiveRecord`: set `_base`/`_resource`, declare the
field schema (narrow `id`), and add `create()`/`save()`. Everything else is inherited.
Only push behavior down into the base when a new resource actually shares it, don't
generalize speculatively for a shape only one subclass needs.

## Generated types

- `make gen-types` runs `datamodel-code-generator` → `lighton/types/api/__init__.py`.
- **Download the schema first**, don't use `--url`: the schema's `$ref` trailing-slash mismatch breaks URL-based resolution.
- Uses `--formatters ruff-check ruff-format` (no black/isort dep), `--use-annotated`, real Enum classes.
- Generated dir is **excluded from ty** (`[tool.ty.src]`): it's machine output validated by pydantic at runtime; chasing type-checker-perfect codegen isn't worth it. Call sites are still type-checked.
- Treat the file as read-only; re-run `make gen-types` to update.

## Release

> **Agents: never cut a release unless the user explicitly asks in that message.**
> `make release` / pushing a `v*` tag publishes a public GitHub Release and is
> effectively irreversible. Bumping versions, editing release files, or planning a
> release is fine on request; *triggering* one requires an explicit, current
> instruction, prior approval for other work never carries over to this.

- **One command:** `make release VERSION=X.Y.Z [DESC="..."]`. It guards (semver, clean
  tree, on `main`, tag not already present), then `uv version` (bumps `pyproject.toml` +
  `uv.lock` together), commits `chore(release): vX.Y.Z`, tags `vX.Y.Z`, and pushes.
  `DESC` (optional) becomes the **annotated tag message**, free-text release notes.
- The pushed tag fires `.github/workflows/release.yml`: it re-checks `tag == uv version`,
  `uv build`s the sdist+wheel, runs **git-cliff** (`cliff.toml`, conventional-commit
  grouping), prepends the annotated-tag message (the `DESC`) above the changelog, and
  `gh release create`s with the artifacts attached.
- **Version is single-source:** `pyproject.toml`. `__version__` in `lighton/__init__.py`
  reads it via `importlib.metadata.version("lighton")`, don't hard-code it back.
- Attach-wheels only; no PyPI publish yet (add `uv publish` + a trusted publisher when wanted).

## Conventions

- **Absolute imports only** (`from lighton.x import y`), no relative. Caveat: keep any runtime `LightOn` import inside a function or `TYPE_CHECKING` to avoid cycles (`__init__` imports `_client`).
- **No inline imports**, all imports at module top. (Test self-checks went to `tests/` precisely so their imports could be top-level without circular issues.)
- **Tests**: pytest, fixtures + `pytest.raises`. `pythonpath = ["."]` so tests import the source tree directly (independent of the editable-install finder, which goes stale when new modules are added). Mock HTTP via `httpx.MockTransport`. The suite never touches the network; the live-API
check is `tests/e2e/cli.py` (`make e2e`), a step-per-feature typer CLI that creates a
throwaway workspace, runs every SDK verb against `tests/e2e/documents/`, and deletes what
it made. Add a step there when you add a feature.
- **Tooling**: ruff (lint + format), ty (type check), pytest, all enforced via pre-commit. `ty` has no autofix; it blocks on errors.
- **uv.lock**: re-stage it after any dependency change before committing, or the ty pre-commit hook (which runs through `uv` and re-resolves) will report a lockfile modification and fail the commit.
- New deps: prefer stdlib → installed dep → a few lines, before adding anything. Mark deliberate simplifications with `ponytail:` comments.
- Non-trivial logic leaves one runnable test behind.
- **Docstrings (public API)**: every public function/method has a docstring documenting
  each argument and the return value (Google-style `Args:`/`Returns:`, plus `Raises:`
  when it raises deliberately). `self`/`cls` are omitted. Private helpers (`_`-prefixed)
  and self-evident one-liners are exempt, don't pad them. Keep it about behavior and
  contract, not a restatement of the signature.
- **Model fields**: every field on a hand-written pydantic model carries a
  `Field(description=...)`, the description is the field's documentation (drives IDE
  hints, JSON schema, and generated docs). Use `Field` keyword args for the default too
  (`Field(None, description=...)`, `Field(default_factory=list, description=...)`); don't
  mix a bare default with a `Field`. This applies to the curated schemas at the package
  root, NOT the generated `types/api/` (regenerated), those already carry descriptions
  from the OpenAPI schema.
- **Docs code examples use the context-manager pattern**: every README/docstring snippet
  that instantiates a client does so as `with LightOn() as client:` (the client implements
  `__enter__`/`__exit__` and closes its httpx pool on exit), not a bare `client = LightOn()`.
  Snippets that only *use* a client may assume one opened that way rather than repeating it.
- **No em-dashes in documentation** (`—`): not in README, AGENTS.md, docstrings, or code
  comments. Use a comma, colon, parentheses, or two sentences instead.
- **Keep the README Contents (table of contents) in sync**: whenever you add, remove,
  rename, or reorder a `##` section in `README.md`, update the `## Contents` list in the
  same change (matching order and GitHub anchor slugs). Don't let it drift.
