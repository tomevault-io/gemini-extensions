# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

SecOpsAgentKit is a collection of Claude Code skills for security operations, DevSecOps, and secure SDLC practices. The repository follows a skill-based architecture where each security capability is packaged as a self-contained skill with YAML frontmatter, executable scripts, reference documentation, and configuration templates.

## Core Architecture

### Skill Structure

Every skill follows a standardized four-part structure:

1. **SKILL.md** (Required): Main skill file with YAML frontmatter defining metadata and markdown body containing procedural knowledge. Must be under 500 lines - use progressive disclosure pattern.

2. **scripts/** (Optional): Executable Python/Bash scripts for deterministic operations. Scripts must be tested and executable before submission.

3. **references/** (Optional): Reference documentation loaded on-demand by Claude. Contains detailed security framework mappings (OWASP, CWE, MITRE ATT&CK), remediation guides, and tool documentation.
 
4. **assets/** (Optional): Templates and configuration files used in output (not loaded into context). Includes CI/CD configs, rule templates, boilerplate code.

### Directory Organization

```
skills/
├── _template/              # DO NOT MODIFY - base template for all skills
├── appsec/                 # Application Security skills
├── devsecops/              # DevSecOps & CI/CD Security
├── secsdlc/                # Secure SDLC
├── threatmodel/            # Threat Modeling
├── compliance/             # Compliance & Auditing
└── incident-response/      # Incident Response
```

Each category contains skills following `skills/<category>/<tool/skill-type>-<tool/skill-name>/` structure.

### Frontmatter Architecture

All skills use YAML frontmatter with strict validation:

**Required fields**: `name`, `description`, `version`, `maintainer`, `category`, `tags`

**Critical**: The `description` field must include "Use when:" clause - this determines skill triggering in Claude Code.

**Versioning**: Semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH). New skills start at 0.1.0.

**Categories**: Must be one of seven valid categories: `appsec`, `devsecops`, `secsdlc`, `threatmodel`, `compliance`, `incident-response`, `offsec`

**Frameworks**: List security frameworks referenced (OWASP, CWE, MITRE-ATT&CK, NIST, SOC2, PCI-DSS, GDPR, ISO27001, HIPAA)

## Development Commands

### Creating a New Skill

```bash
# Initialize from template
./scripts/init_skill.sh <skill-name> <category>

# Example: Create SAST skill in appsec category
./scripts/init_skill.sh sast-analyzer appsec
```

The initialization script:
- Validates skill name (must be kebab-case)
- Validates category (must be one of seven valid categories)
- Creates directory structure from `skills/_template/`
- Auto-populates frontmatter with skill name and category
- Makes scripts executable

### Validating a Skill

```bash
# Validate skill structure and frontmatter
./scripts/validate_skill.py skills/<category>/<skill-name>

# Example
./scripts/validate_skill.py skills/appsec/sast-semgrep
```

**Requires**: PyYAML (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)

The validator checks:
- YAML frontmatter format and required fields
- Semantic versioning compliance
- Description quality (length, "Use when" clause presence)
- Name format (kebab-case)
- Category validity
- No auxiliary files (README.md, CHANGELOG.md forbidden)
- Script executability
- Reference file linkage from SKILL.md

### Marketplace Integration

Skills are registered in `skills/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`:

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    {
      "name": "plugin-name",
      "description": "Plugin description",
      "skills": ["./category/skill-name"]
    }
  ]
}
```

When adding a skill, update this file to register it under the appropriate plugin.

## Skill Development Patterns

### Progressive Disclosure

Keep SKILL.md concise (<500 lines). Move detailed content to `references/`:

- **SKILL.md**: Core workflows, quick start, common patterns
- **references/**: Detailed framework mappings, comprehensive remediation guides, extensive rule libraries

Link references clearly from SKILL.md with specific "when to read" guidance.

### Security-First Requirements

Every skill must document:
- **Sensitive Data Handling**: How to handle secrets, credentials, PII
- **Access Control**: Required permissions and authorization context
- **Audit Logging**: What should be logged for compliance
- **Compliance**: Relevant standards (SOC2, GDPR, PCI-DSS)
- **Safe Defaults**: Secure-by-default configurations

### Script Requirements

Scripts in `scripts/` directory:
- Must be tested before submission
- Must be executable (`chmod +x`)
- Should follow language-specific templates in `_template/scripts/`
- Must handle errors gracefully with proper exit codes
- Should support common flags (--help, --verbose, --output)

### Writing Style

Use imperative form in all instructions:
- ✓ "Run the security scan"
- ✗ "You should run the security scan"

Avoid generic development advice already known to Claude.

## Key Constraints

1. **No Auxiliary Files**: Do not create README.md, CHANGELOG.md, INSTALLATION.md, etc. Only SKILL.md is allowed for documentation.

2. **Template Immutability**: Never modify `skills/_template/` directly. It's the source for all new skills via init script.

3. **Frontmatter Completeness**: Description field is critical for skill triggering - must be comprehensive with specific "Use when" scenarios.

4. **Conciseness Over Completeness**: Context window is shared. Only include what Claude doesn't already know.

5. **Security Framework Alignment**: Skills should map findings/guidance to OWASP Top 10, CWE, and other relevant frameworks.

6. **No Deeply Nested References**: Keep references one level deep from SKILL.md. All reference files link directly from SKILL.md.

## Common Workflows

### Adding a Skill to Existing Category

1. Run `./scripts/init_skill.sh new-skill category`
2. Edit `SKILL.md` - update description, maintainer, tags, frameworks
3. Add scripts with proper shebang and executable permissions
4. Add reference docs if needed (link from SKILL.md)
5. Add assets (templates, configs) if needed
6. Run `./scripts/validate_skill.py skills/category/new-skill`
7. Update `skills/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`
8. Test skill in real security scenarios

### Updating Skill Version

Follow semantic versioning:
- **PATCH** (0.1.0 → 0.1.1): Bug fixes, doc updates, typo corrections
- **MINOR** (0.1.0 → 0.2.0): New scripts, enhanced workflows, additional framework coverage
- **MAJOR** (0.1.0 → 1.0.0): Breaking changes to frontmatter, removed resources, incompatible workflows

Update the `version` field in SKILL.md frontmatter.

### Skill Testing

Before submission:
1. Run validation script
2. Test all bundled scripts
3. Verify references are accessible and linked
4. Confirm no placeholder text (TODO, FIXME, your-github-username)
5. Check SKILL.md line count (<500)
6. Validate marketplace.json is valid JSON

## Reference Documentation

- **CONTRIBUTE.md**: Complete contribution guidelines with frontmatter standards, quality requirements, submission process
- **SKILL_REFERENCE.md**: Quick reference for frontmatter fields, semantic versioning, common patterns
- **README.md**: Project overview and high-level skill usage
- **requirements.txt**: Python dependencies (currently only PyYAML for validation)

## Security Framework Context

Skills in this repository operate within these security frameworks:

- **OWASP Top 10**: Web application security risks
- **CWE**: Common weakness enumeration for software vulnerabilities
- **MITRE ATT&CK**: Adversarial tactics and techniques
- **NIST**: Security and privacy controls
- **SOC2**: Service organization controls for security, availability, confidentiality
- **PCI-DSS**: Payment card industry data security
- **GDPR**: General data protection regulation

When creating skills, map security findings and remediation guidance to these frameworks where applicable.
