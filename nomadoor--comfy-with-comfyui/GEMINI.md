# AGENTS.md — Comfy with ComfyUI (Docs) / Agent Principles

## Motto

Small, clear, safe steps — and one source of truth in `/ops`.

> Any verbal agreement must be reflected in `/ops` immediately.

---

## Live Directives Trump Documentation

If a conflict exists between older documentation and a newer verbal or written directive from the owner, the **newer directive takes precedence**.

Once a decision is made, you **must update `/ops`** to prevent documentation drift from reality.

---

## 1. Purpose

The primary purpose is to provide a **systematic and reproducible** documentation set for ComfyUI and its workflows.

* Treat `/ops` as the **Single Source of Truth (SSOT)** for Information Architecture (IA), writing rules, design tokens, and contribution rules.
* Keep the implementation (11ty, layouts, components, content) **aligned with `/ops` at all times**.

---

## 2. Scope and Non-Scope

### In Scope

* The documentation site built with Eleventy (11ty).
    * **Canonical URL Pattern**: `/<lang>/<section>/<slug>/`
* IA structure (sections, page types, navigation) as defined in `/ops`.
* Content and examples for:
    * Local ComfyUI setup and usage.
    * AI capabilities (models, depth, video, etc.).
    * Basic and advanced workflows with JSON examples.
* Design system and UI behavior as defined in:
    * `/ops/style-design.md` (Visual and layout tokens)
    * `/ops/style-writing.md` (Writing rules, headings, examples)
* JavaScript written **exclusively as ES Modules**.
* SVG icons that **inherit `currentColor`**.

### Out of Scope

* Maintaining external project-management tools (Notion, Scrapbox, etc.).
* Supporting legacy themes, deprecated UI, or third-party skins not aligned with `/ops`.
* "Random experiments" that are not tied to a concrete document or Architecture Decision Record (ADR).

---

## 3. Ground Rules

### No Silent UX / UI Changes

Any UI or design change must be:

1.  **Proposed and agreed upon** with the human owner.
2.  Implemented as a **focused change** (branch + PR).
3.  **Not extended or "improved"** further without explicit agreement.

### `/ops` First Principle

If you change behavior, IA, naming, or conventions, you **must start by updating `/ops`**.

Code and content are then updated to match the changes in `/ops`.

### Persistent IDs

* IDs, slugs, and major URLs **must be stable**.
* Renames require an **ADR and navigation updates**, not ad-hoc edits.

### Reproducible Workflows Only

Workflow JSONs must be complete enough for a third party to **reproduce the results**.

### Authorship Boundary

The human owner is the author, not the agent. Do not perform edits that exceed light proofreading of the owner's text.

---

## 4. Information Architecture and Writing

Detailed rules for IA (headings, page templates, narrative structure, examples) are enforced in a separate file.

* **Canonical Reference**: `/ops/style-writing.md`
* This file enforces that the rules defined there are **treated as binding**.
* Do not invent custom heading patterns or page layouts: **always follow `/ops/style-writing.md`**.

---

## 5. Tagging

Tags are optional.

When tags are present, they must be:

* **Consistent** with the page slug and topic.
* **Specific** but not spammy.
* **Maximum 5 tags per page.**

For `ai-capabilities`, default is no tags unless explicitly requested by the owner and documented in `/ops`.

---

## 6. URL and Identity

### Canonical URL Format

* **Format**: `/<lang>/<section>/<slug>/`
* `lang` $\in$ { `ja`, `en`, `zh` }
* `section` $\in$ { `begin-with`, `ai-capabilities`, `basic-workflows`, `data-utilities`, `notes` }
* `slug` is a **kebab-case, permanent identifier**.

### Slug Rules

* No **duplicate (`section`, `slug`) pairs** across the site.
* No "temporary" slugs; treat slugs as **stable IDs**.
* Slug changes require: **navigation update + ADR**.

### Assets

* Mockups and illustrations reside under `src/assets/mock/` or other agreed subfolders.
* All visual tokens (colors, radii, shadows, spacing) are defined in `/ops/style-design.md`.

---

## 7. Design Tokens and Assets

Colors, typography, border radii, spacing, and shadows are defined in `/ops/style-design.md`.

Any change to design tokens:

1.  **Must be proposed in `/ops/style-design.md` first.**
2.  Then implemented in CSS / utility classes.

Layout or component variations must align with:

* Existing token names.
* Previously agreed **responsive behavior**.

---

## 8. JavaScript / ESM

All JavaScript must be written as **ESM**:

* No new CommonJS modules.
* Use `"type": "module"` where appropriate.

### Icons

* Stored in `src/assets/icons/*.svg`.
* Must define a `viewBox`.
* Must use `fill="currentColor"` or **inherit `currentColor`**.

---

## 9. CI / Quality Gates

Before merging any Pull Request (PR):

* `section` + `slug` **uniqueness is preserved**.
* `nav.*.yml` slugs **match the actual file structure and IA**.

**Each page** must:

* Use the correct section and template as per `/ops`.
* If tags are present, keep them to $\leq 5$.

**All images** must:

* Use appropriate formats and sizes (no unbounded raw dumps).
* Provide explicit width/height unless rendered via the Gyazo pipeline (`{gyazo=image|loop}` or equivalent shortcode path) where layout sizing is enforced by renderer/CSS tokens.

> If these gates cannot be satisfied, the **PR is not ready for merge**.

---

## 10. ADR Cadence

Any change that affects IA, URL structure, or the design system **requires an ADR**.

An ADR is required when:

* Changing IA (sections, page types, navigation patterns).
* Introducing or removing major components or layouts.
* Changing authoring rules in `/ops/style-writing.md`.
* Modifying CI / quality criteria.

> Minor changes can be batched into a **weekly rollup ADR**, but they must still be documented.

---

## 11. MCP and Tool Usage

The goal is to use **Master Control Program (MCP) servers aggressively and intelligently**, not to restrict them.

At startup or on first use, an agent should:

* **Enumerate** available MCP servers and their capabilities.
* **Cache or summarize** what each MCP can do (file access, search, browsing, etc.).

When performing tasks (e.g., reading/writing files, searching, formatting), the agent should:

* **Prefer MCP tools** over custom shell commands when they are safer and more structured.
* Use the **most specialized MCP** for each job.

If a task can be expressed as:

* "Read/Write a project file"
* "Search in docs"
* "Format / lint content"

> The agent must attempt to route it through **MCP first**, falling back to raw shell only when strictly necessary.

Agents must not ignore available MCPs. **Discover and use them** to the maximum extent compatible with safety and clarity.

---

## 12. Collaboration and Git Workflow

### 12.1 General Collaboration

Verbal agreement $\rightarrow$ `/ops` update $\rightarrow$ implementation $\rightarrow$ PR $\rightarrow$ review $\rightarrow$ merge.

If the specification in `/ops` is ambiguous:

* Open an Issue.
* **Propose a clarification in `/ops`** before pushing large changes.

### 12.1.1 Push Requires Explicit Owner Instruction

Agents **must not push** local commits, force-push, update an existing PR branch, or otherwise publish local changes to any remote unless the owner explicitly says to push in the current work sequence.

* Opening a PR, updating a PR, amending a pushed commit, and force-pushing all count as **push/publish operations**.
* "Fix this review" or "address this finding" means edit and validate locally only, unless the owner also says to push.
* If a push seems necessary, stop and ask for explicit permission first.

### 12.2 New Feature Rule (Commit / Branch Before Work)

Before implementing any new feature on your own initiative:

* Do not work directly on `main` (or the primary trunk) without structure.
* Instead, you **must**:
    1.  **Create a dedicated feature branch** that clearly states the intent in its name, **and**
    2.  **Commit at least a minimal, explicit change** that:
        * Updates `/ops` with the planned feature, **or**
        * Adds a small, **reversible scaffold** (e.g., empty layout, stub page, or TODO section).

> **The guiding principle is**: "First record the intent in Git, then expand it."
> This makes the intent obvious and allows easy rollback or review.
> **No large, untracked, or half-hidden feature work is allowed.**
> Do not merge to `main` without explicit owner approval; keep feature work on its branch until reviewed.

---

13. Encoding & File I/O Rule

> All files must be UTF-8 (no BOM).
> Do not modify system encoding settings.
> If encoding issues occur → stop and ask.

No custom encoding helpers, no codepage manipulation, no guessing.


Agents should reuse these exact patterns (with path and content substituted) rather than inventing ad-hoc file I/O commands.
