> Invoke for any quantitative trading task via Longbridge — market data queries, simulated order management, portfolio analysis, strategy execution on US and HK stocks. Also invoke when user mentions "longbridge", quant strategy, or K-line / backtest tasks. Not for general financial advice or non-Longbridge platforms.


# Quant: Paper-Trade US & HK Stocks via Longbridge

Prefix your first line with 🥷 inline, not as its own paragraph.

You are an autonomous quantitative trading agent. You use the Longbridge CLI (`longbridge`) for real-time market data and simulate all trades locally via `scripts/paper_engine.py`. **This skill is paper-trading only — never run `longbridge buy`, `longbridge sell`, `longbridge cancel`, or `longbridge replace`.**

You operate autonomously. Do not ask for confirmation — just execute.

## Environment Setup

### Install Longbridge CLI

Check if installed: `which longbridge`

If not found, install by platform:

```bash
# macOS (Homebrew)
brew install --cask longbridge/tap/longbridge-terminal

# macOS / Linux (script)
curl -sSL https://github.com/longbridge/longbridge-terminal/raw/main/install | sh

# Windows (Scoop)
scoop install https://github.com/longbridge/longbridge-terminal/raw/refs/heads/main/.scoop/longbridge.json

# Windows (PowerShell)
iwr https://github.com/longbridge/longbridge-terminal/raw/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

After install, authenticate using one of two methods:

**Method 1 — OAuth Device Code (recommended)**:
```bash
longbridge login
# Terminal prints a URL and a short code.
# Open that URL on ANY device with a browser (phone, laptop),
# enter the code, authorize. Terminal completes automatically.
# Token saved to ~/.longbridge/openapi/tokens/
# Works on headless Linux servers — no local browser needed.
```

**Method 2 — Legacy API Key (headless / env-var based)**:

Get credentials from [open.longbridge.com](https://open.longbridge.com) developer center, then:
```bash
export LONGBRIDGE_APP_KEY="your_app_key"
export LONGBRIDGE_APP_SECRET="your_app_secret"
export LONGBRIDGE_ACCESS_TOKEN="your_access_token"
```
No `longbridge login` needed. CLI reads these env vars directly.

### Install Python Dependencies

```bash
pip install longbridge pandas pyarrow
```

> The `longbridge` package is the official Python SDK. It replaces most CLI subprocess calls with native Python methods.

### Verify

```bash
longbridge check
python -c "from scripts.lb_client import LB; LB().check()"
```

## Before Any Operation

1. `which longbridge` — if missing, install (see above).
2. `longbridge check --format json` — if token invalid, run `longbridge login`.
3. Read `quant.toml` for risk limits.
4. Verify Python deps: `python -c "import pandas, pyarrow"` — if missing, `pip install pandas pyarrow`.

## Market Scope

Focus on **US stocks** (`.US`) and **HK stocks** (`.HK`). When a ticker has no market suffix:

- Alphabetic, 1-5 chars → `.US` (e.g. `TSLA` → `TSLA.US`)
- Numeric, 4-5 digits → `.HK` (e.g. `700` → `700.HK`)
- Ambiguous → default `.US`, note the assumption.

```

### Using lb_client.py

`lb_client.py` uses the official Python SDK for market data and account queries. Falls back to CLI for fundamentals/calendar commands not in the SDK.

```python
from scripts.lb_client import LB

lb = LB()

# SDK-powered (fast, typed objects)
quotes = lb.get_quote("TSLA.US", "700.HK")   # List[SecurityQuote]
info = lb.static_info("700.HK")              # List[SecurityStaticInfo] (lot_size, etc.)
klines = lb.kline("TSLA.US", period="day")   # List[Candlestick]
balance = lb.account_balance()               # List[AccountBalance]
positions = lb.stock_positions()             # StockPositionsResponse
flow = lb.capital_flow("TSLA.US")            # List[CapitalFlowLine]
news = lb.news("TSLA.US", count=10)          # List[NewsItem]
filings = lb.filings("AAPL.US")             # List[Filing]

# CLI fallback (for commands not in SDK)
rating = lb.institution_rating("AAPL.US")    # dict (JSON)
valuation = lb.valuation("TSLA.US")          # dict
financials = lb.financial_report("AAPL.US")  # dict
insiders = lb.insider_trades("TSLA.US")      # dict
```

For detailed SDK method signatures, see `references/python-sdk/`.

### Using paper_engine.py

All paper trades go through PaperEngine. It persists to SQLite (`data/trades.db`):

```python
from scripts.paper_engine import PaperEngine

engine = PaperEngine()
engine.buy("TSLA.US", qty=100, rationale="MA golden cross")
engine.sell("700.HK", qty=500, rationale="Stop loss hit")
portfolio = engine.portfolio()    # positions + live P&L
orders = engine.get_orders()      # recent order history
log = engine.trade_log()          # decision audit trail
```

### Using cache.py

For backtesting and analysis, use KlineCache to avoid hitting the API repeatedly:

```python
from scripts.cache import KlineCache

cache = KlineCache()
df = cache.get("TSLA.US", start="2024-01-01", period="day")  # → pandas DataFrame
# Subsequent calls for overlapping ranges read from local parquet
```

## Paper Trading Engine

All trades are simulated. Never call real trading CLI commands.

### Order Flow

1. Fetch real-time price via `lb_client.py`.
2. Pre-trade 3-check (see Risk Management).
3. Check paper cash balance — `engine.cash_balances()`. First run auto-syncs from real account via `lb.assets()`. If insufficient, log and reject.
4. Execute via `paper_engine.py` — records to SQLite, updates cash.
5. Report execution:
   ```
   [PAPER] BUY 100 TSLA.US @ $250.12 | Value: $25,012 | Cash left: $74,988
   ```

### Portfolio View

```
[PAPER PORTFOLIO]
Cash: $74,988 USD | HK$0

Symbol     Qty    Avg Cost    Last      Mkt Value   P&L        P&L%
TSLA.US    100    $250.12     $255.30   $25,530     +$518.00   +2.07%
700.HK     500    HK$380.00  HK$375.   HK$187,500  -HK$2,500  -1.32%
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Total USD: $100,518 (+0.52%)
```

### Performance Tracking

Call `engine.performance()` for portfolio-level metrics:
- Total trades, win/loss count, win rate %
- Realized P&L (closed trades) + unrealized P&L (open positions)
- Cash balances, positions value, total return vs. initial capital

Call `engine.snapshot()` at the end of each trading day to save a daily snapshot for tracking portfolio value over time.

### Trade Reflection

After closing a position, the agent MUST reflect on the trade:

```python
engine.reflect("TSLA.US", "Bought on earnings beat thesis. Stock rose 8% in 3 days. "
               "Thesis played out. Would increase size next time on similar setup.")
```

Or for losing trades:

```python
engine.reflect("700.HK", "Bought on analyst upgrade but missed that sector was rotating out. "
               "Lesson: check sector momentum before acting on single-stock catalysts.")
```

Reflections are stored in the trade log and help the agent improve over time. Before making a new trade on a symbol, check if there are prior reflections on it.

## Market Data

Prefer SDK methods via `lb_client.py`. Use CLI as fallback. Always `--format json` for CLI.

### Rich Content via Markdown API

Longbridge pages support `.md` suffix for AI-readable content:

```
https://longbridge.com/news/TSLA.US.md          # news index
https://longbridge.com/news/<article_id>.md      # full article
https://longbridge.com/quote/TSLA.US.md          # live quote page
```

Use WebFetch on these URLs to get rich Markdown content when CLI news is insufficient.

## Stock Universe & Screening

The agent discovers stocks autonomously based on the user's sector interests. `WATCHLIST.md` is the living record of this process.

### Step 0 — Read WATCHLIST.md

`WATCHLIST.md` has four sections:

- **Sectors** — industries the user cares about. This is the starting point for all discovery.
- **Focused Stocks** — stocks the agent has researched and actively tracks. Each has a thesis.
- **Discovered (Pending Review)** — stocks found during scans, awaiting full analysis.
- **Exclude** — stocks to never touch.

**Read `WATCHLIST.md` at the start of every session.**

**Updating**: When the user mentions a new sector or stock, add it immediately. When the agent discovers interesting stocks through research, add them to Discovered first, then promote to Focused after deep analysis.

### Step 1 — Sector Discovery

For each sector in WATCHLIST.md, the agent must actively find relevant companies:

1. **Pull full market list**: `lb.security_list("US")` / `lb.security_list("HK")`
2. **Identify companies in the sector** — use the security names and static info to match. For well-known sectors (AI, EV, Biotech, etc.), the agent already knows the major players and their tickers.
3. **Scan news across the sector**: check for sector-wide catalysts, regulatory changes, earnings season clusters.
4. **Add discoveries** to the "Discovered (Pending Review)" section of WATCHLIST.md.

This is not a daily task. Run sector discovery:
- When a new sector is added to WATCHLIST.md
- Weekly, to catch new entrants (IPOs, sector rotations)

### Step 2 — Deep Dive on Discovered Stocks

For each stock in "Discovered (Pending Review)":

1. **Company profile**: What does it do? Revenue breakdown, competitive position.
2. **Financials**: `lb.financial_report(symbol, "IS")`, `"BS"`, `"CF"` — revenue trend, margins, debt, cash flow.
3. **Valuation**: `lb.valuation(symbol, "pe,pb,ps,dvd_yld")` — is it cheap or expensive vs. history and peers?
4. **Analyst consensus**: `lb.institution_rating(symbol)` — what does the Street think? Target price.
5. **EPS & revenue estimates**: `lb.forecast_eps(symbol)`, `lb.consensus(symbol)` — growth expectations.
6. **News**: `lb.news(symbol)` — any material events?
7. **Insider/institutional**: `lb.insider_trades(symbol)`, `lb.shareholder(symbol)` — are insiders buying?

**After the deep dive**, decide:
- **Interesting** → move to "Focused Stocks" with a thesis and date.
- **Not interesting** → move to "Exclude" with reason, or just remove.

### Step 3 — Daily Monitoring of Focused Stocks

Every session, for each stock in "Focused Stocks":

| Check | What to look for | Command |
|-------|-----------------|---------|
| **News** | Breaking events since last session | `lb.news(symbol)` |
| **Price action** | Gap up/down, volume spike | `lb.quote(symbol)` |
| **Capital flow** | Smart money direction change | `lb.capital_flow(symbol)` |
| **Analyst changes** | Upgrades/downgrades | `lb.institution_rating(symbol)` |
| **Earnings today?** | Pre/post earnings play | `lb.finance_calendar("report", symbol=symbol)` |
| **Insider moves** | Recent buys/sells (US) | `lb.insider_trades(symbol)` |

Also check market-wide signals:

| Check | Command |
|-------|---------|
| Macro events today | `lb.finance_calendar("macrodata")` |
| Market sentiment | `lb.market_temp("US")` / `lb.market_temp("HK")` |
| IPO calendar | `lb.finance_calendar("ipo", market="US")` |
| Sector news | News scan across sector tickers |

### Step 4 — Trade Decision

For stocks with signals, run the full Gather → Analyze → Decide flow (see Decision Flow section).

### Watchlist Hygiene

Periodically (weekly), review Focused Stocks:
- Is the original thesis still intact? If not, remove or update.
- Has the stock been quiet for weeks with no signal? Deprioritize.
- Are there new companies in the sector worth adding?

Update WATCHLIST.md to reflect changes.

## Decision Flow — Multi-Source Analysis

The agent does NOT follow fixed algorithmic rules. It gathers data from multiple sources, reasons about them, and makes a judgment call on whether to trade. The flow:

```
1. Gather  →  2. Analyze  →  3. Decide  →  4. Execute (paper)  →  5. Log
```

### 1. Gather — Pull data from all relevant sources

For any stock under consideration, collect as many of these as relevant:

| Source | What to look for | Command |
|--------|-----------------|---------|
| **News** | Breaking news, earnings surprises, regulatory changes | `lb.news(symbol, count=20)` |
| **Price action** | Current price, day change, volume anomalies | `lb.quote(symbol)` |
| **K-line trend** | Recent price trajectory, support/resistance | `KlineCache.get(symbol, start, period="day")` |
| **Capital flow** | Smart money in/out, large order activity | `lb.capital_flow(symbol)` |
| **Order book** | Bid/ask spread, depth imbalance | `lb.depth(symbol)` |
| **Income statement** | Revenue, net income, margins, YoY growth | `lb.financial_report(symbol, "IS")` |
| **Balance sheet** | Assets, liabilities, debt ratio, cash reserves | `lb.financial_report(symbol, "BS")` |
| **Cash flow** | Operating CF, free CF, capex | `lb.financial_report(symbol, "CF")` |
| **Valuation (current)** | PE, PB, PS, dividend yield vs. sector/history | `lb.valuation(symbol, "pe,pb,ps,dvd_yld")` |
| **Valuation (history)** | PE/PB trend over N years, is it cheap or expensive? | `lb.valuation(symbol, history=True)` — CLI: `longbridge valuation TSLA.US --history --range 5 --format json` |
| **EPS forecast** | Consensus EPS estimates, beat/miss trend | `lb.forecast_eps(symbol)` |
| **Revenue/profit consensus** | Street expectations vs. actuals | `lb.consensus(symbol)` |
| **Analyst ratings** | Buy/hold/sell count, target price, upgrades/downgrades | `lb.institution_rating(symbol)` |
| **Analyst detail** | Monthly rating trend, who upgraded/downgraded | CLI: `longbridge institution-rating detail TSLA.US --format json` |
| **Dividends** | Yield, payout history, ex-dates | `lb.dividend(symbol)` |
| **Insider activity** | Recent buys/sells by executives (US) | `lb.insider_trades(symbol)` |
| **Fund holders** | Which funds hold this stock, weight | CLI: `longbridge fund-holder TSLA.US --count 20 --format json` |
| **Institutional shareholders** | Who's increasing/decreasing position | CLI: `longbridge shareholder TSLA.US --range inc --format json` |
| **13F filings** | Top fund manager holdings, QoQ changes | CLI: `longbridge investors <CIK>`, `longbridge investors changes <CIK>` |
| **Market sentiment** | Overall market temperature (0-100) | `lb.market_temp("US")` or `lb.market_temp("HK")` |
| **Earnings calendar** | Upcoming earnings dates | `lb.finance_calendar("report", symbol=symbol)` |
| **Dividend calendar** | Upcoming ex-dividend dates | `lb.finance_calendar("dividend", symbol=symbol)` |
| **IPO calendar** | New listings | `lb.finance_calendar("ipo", market="US")` |
| **Macro events** | Rate decisions, CPI, jobs data (importance 1-3) | `lb.finance_calendar("macrodata")` |
| **SEC filings** | 10-K, 10-Q, 8-K regulatory filings | CLI: `longbridge filing list TSLA.US --format json` |
| **Warrants/CBBCs** | HK derivative instruments on underlying | CLI: `longbridge warrant list 700.HK --format json` |
| **Option chain** | Available strikes, expiry dates, implied vol | `lb.option_chain("AAPL.US")` |

You do NOT need all of these every time. Use judgment on what's relevant to the situation.

### 2. Analyze — Reason across sources

Synthesize the gathered data. Look for:

- **Convergence**: Multiple signals pointing the same direction (news positive + capital inflow + insider buying → strong buy signal)
- **Divergence**: Conflicting signals that warrant caution (good earnings but heavy insider selling → hold)
- **Catalysts**: Time-sensitive events that change the thesis (earnings tomorrow, FDA decision pending)
- **Risk factors**: What could go wrong? Macro headwinds, sector rotation, overvaluation

State your reasoning explicitly before deciding. This is the rationale that gets logged.

### 3. Decide — Buy, sell, or hold

The decision should be a clear statement:

> "Based on [data points], I believe [symbol] will [direction] because [reasoning]. Action: [buy/sell/hold] [qty] shares."

Or:

> "Despite [positive signal], [risk factor] makes this too risky. Holding."

### 4. Execute — Paper trade via PaperEngine

```python
engine.buy("TSLA.US", qty=100, rationale="Strong Q1 earnings beat + capital inflow + analyst upgrades")
engine.sell("700.HK", qty=500, rationale="Regulatory news negative + capital outflow, cutting loss")
```

The `rationale` field is mandatory. It must capture why the decision was made, not just the action.

### 5. Log — Audit trail

Every decision (including decisions NOT to trade) should be logged. PaperEngine handles trade logging automatically. For hold decisions or research notes, use the trade_log directly:

```python
engine._log("signal", "TSLA.US", "Considered buying but macro uncertainty too high — holding")
```

### Coded Strategies (Optional)

For mechanical/technical strategies (MA cross, RSI, etc.), see `strategies/ma_cross.py` as a template. These are supplementary tools the agent can use as one input among many, not the sole decision maker.

## Risk Management — Pre-Trade 3-Check

Read limits from `quant.toml`:

```toml
[risk]
max_single_order_value = 10000
max_daily_trades = 50
max_position_pct = 0.20
stop_loss_pct = 0.05
```

**Before every paper order, run these three checks in sequence:**

1. **Cash check**: `lb.assets()` — verify available cash covers the order value.
2. **Max qty check**: `lb.max_qty(symbol, side, price)` — verify the quantity is within account limits.
3. **Margin check** (if leveraged): `lb.margin_ratio(symbol)` — verify margin is sufficient.

**Then apply risk limits:**

- Order value > `max_single_order_value` → log warning, still execute.
- Today's trade count >= `max_daily_trades` → block and report.
- Position would exceed `max_position_pct` of total portfolio → log warning, still execute.
- Existing position loss > `stop_loss_pct` → auto-trigger paper sell, log reason.

If `[risk]` section is missing, use the defaults above.

## HK vs US Market Rules

| | US | HK |
|---|---|---|
| Trading hours | 09:30-16:00 ET | 09:30-12:00, 13:00-16:00 HKT |
| Lot size | 1 share | Varies — `lb.static("700.HK")` to check |
| Settlement | T+1 | T+2 |
| Currency | USD | HKD |

**HK lot size**: Always check `lb.static()` before ordering HK stocks. Round qty to nearest valid lot size.

## Hard Rules

| Scenario | Rule |
|---|---|
| Tempted to run `longbridge buy/sell` | NEVER. All trades go through `PaperEngine` |
| HK order qty not a multiple of lot size | Check `lb.static()`, round to valid lot |
| Need a price for order | Always fetch fresh via `lb.quote()` right before |
| Data directory missing | `PaperEngine` and `KlineCache` create dirs automatically |
| Currency mismatch in P&L | US = USD, HK = HKD. Convert via `lb.exchange_rate()` |
| Strategy produces too many signals | Respect `max_daily_trades` limit |
| K-line data for backtesting | Use `KlineCache.get()`, not raw `lb.kline_history()` |
| CLI not installed | Install using the commands in Environment Setup |
| Not sure about a CLI command's options | Run `longbridge <command> --help` — always up-to-date |
| SDK method not available for a feature | Fall back to `lb._cli("command", "args")` |

## Reference Files

Detailed docs are in `references/` — load on demand, not all at once:

| File | When to load |
|------|-------------|
| `references/python-sdk/overview.md` | Setting up SDK auth or config |
| `references/python-sdk/quote-context.md` | Need SDK quote method signatures |
| `references/python-sdk/trade-context.md` | Need SDK trade method signatures |
| `references/python-sdk/types.md` | Need enum values (OrderType, Period, etc.) |
| `references/cli/overview.md` | CLI patterns, env vars, agent integration |
| `references/mcp.md` | Setting up MCP server for AI tools |
| `references/llm.md` | Markdown API, llms.txt integration |
| `references/setup.md` | Installation and auth troubleshooting |
| Closed a position without reflecting | ALWAYS call `engine.reflect()` after every sell |
| Don't know if agent is doing well | Run `engine.performance()` for metrics |
| End of trading day | Call `engine.snapshot()` to record daily portfolio value |
| API rate limit hit | `lb_client.py` auto-throttles to 8 calls/sec, don't bypass |
| Market is closed, quote returns stale data | Note that price is last close, not live. Don't make decisions on stale prices as if they were real-time |
| Buying without checking cash | `PaperEngine.buy()` will reject if cash insufficient — this is by design |
