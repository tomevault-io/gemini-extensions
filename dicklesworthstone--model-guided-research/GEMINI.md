> RULE NUMBER 1 (NEVER EVER EVER FORGET THIS RULE!!!): YOU ARE NEVER ALLOWED TO DELETE A FILE WITHOUT EXPRESS PERMISSION FROM ME OR A DIRECT COMMAND FROM ME. EVEN A NEW FILE THAT YOU YOURSELF CREATED, SUCH AS A TEST CODE FILE. YOU HAVE A HORRIBLE TRACK RECORD OF DELETING CRITICALLY IMPORTANT FILES OR OTHERWISE THROWING AWAY TONS OF EXPENSIVE WORK THAT I THEN NEED TO PAY TO REPRODUCE. AS A RESULT, YOU HAVE PERMANENTLY LOST ANY AND ALL RIGHTS TO DETERMINE THAT A FILE OR FOLDER SHOULD BE DELETED. YOU MUST **ALWAYS** ASK AND *RECEIVE* CLEAR, WRITTEN PERMISSION FROM ME BEFORE EVER EVEN THINKING OF DELETING A FILE OR FOLDER OF ANY KIND!!!

We only use uv in this project, NEVER pip. And we use a venv. And we ONLY target python 3.13 (we don't care about compatibility with earlier python versions), and we ONLY use pyproject.toml (not requirements.txt) for managing the project. 

NEVER run a script that processes/changes code files in this repo, EVER! That sort of brittle, regex based stuff is always a huge disaster and creates far more problems than it ever solves. DO NOT BE LAZY AND ALWAYS MAKE CODE CHANGES MANUALLY, EVEN WHEN THERE ARE MANY INSTANCE TO FIX. IF THE CHANGES ARE MANY BUT SIMPLE, THEN USE SEVERAL SUBAGENTS IN PARALLEL TO MAKE THE CHANGES GO FASTER. But if the changes are subtle/complex, then you must methodically do them all yourself manually!

We do not care at all about backwards compatibility since we are still in early development with no users-- we just want to do things the RIGHT way in a clean, organized manner with NO TECH DEBT. That means, never create "compatibility shims" or any other nonsense like that.

We need to AVOID uncontrolled proliferation of code files. If you want to change something or add a feature, then you MUST revise the existing code file in place. You may NEVER, *EVER* take an existing code file, say, "document_processor.py" and then create a new file called "document_processorV2.py", or "document_processor_improved.py", or "document_processor_enhanced.py", or "document_processor_unified.py", or ANYTHING ELSE REMOTELY LIKE THAT! New code files are reserved for GENUINELY NEW FUNCTIONALITY THAT MAKES ZERO SENSE AT ALL TO INCLUDE IN ANY EXISTING CODE FILE. It should be an *INCREDIBLY* high bar for you to EVER create a new code file!

We want all console output to be informative, detailed, stylish, colorful, etc. by fully leveraging the rich library wherever possible. 

If you aren't 100% sure about how to use a third party library, then you must SEARCH ONLINE to find the latest documentation website for the library to understand how it is supposed to work and the latest (mid-2025) suggested best practices and usage.

## MCP Agent Mail — Multi-Agent Coordination

Agent Mail is already available as an MCP server; do not treat it as a CLI you must shell out to.

What it gives:

- Identities, inbox/outbox, searchable threads.
- Advisory file reservations (leases) to avoid agents clobbering each other.
- Persistent artifacts in git (human-auditable).

Core patterns:

1. **Same repo**
   - Register identity:
     - `ensure_project` then `register_agent` with the repo’s absolute path as `project_key`.
   - Reserve files before editing:
     - `file_reservation_paths(project_key, agent_name, ["src/**"], ttl_seconds=3600, exclusive=true)`.
   - Communicate:
     - `send_message(..., thread_id="FEAT-123")`.
     - `fetch_inbox`, then `acknowledge_message`.
   - Fast reads:
     - `resource://inbox/{Agent}?project=<abs-path>&limit=20`.
     - `resource://thread/{id}?project=<abs-path>&include_bodies=true`.
   - Optional:
     - Set `AGENT_NAME` so the pre-commit guard can block conflicting commits.
     - `WORKTREES_ENABLED=1` and `AGENT_MAIL_GUARD_MODE=warn` during trials.
     - Check hooks with `mcp-agent-mail guard status .` and identity with `mcp-agent-mail mail status .`.

2. **Multiple repos in one product**
   - Option A: Same `project_key` for all; use specific reservations (`frontend/**`, `backend/**`).
   - Option B: Different projects linked via:
     - `macro_contact_handshake` or `request_contact` / `respond_contact`.
     - Use a shared `thread_id` (e.g., ticket key) for cross-repo threads.

Macros vs granular:

- Prefer macros when speed is more important than fine-grained control:
  - `macro_start_session`, `macro_prepare_thread`, `macro_file_reservation_cycle`, `macro_contact_handshake`.
- Use granular tools when you need explicit behavior.

Product bus:

- Create/ensure product: `mcp-agent-mail products ensure MyProduct --name "My Product"`.
- Link repo: `mcp-agent-mail products link MyProduct .`.
- Inspect: `mcp-agent-mail products status MyProduct`.
- Search: `mcp-agent-mail products search MyProduct "br-123 OR \"release plan\"" --limit 50`.
- Product inbox: `mcp-agent-mail products inbox MyProduct YourAgent --limit 50 --urgent-only --include-bodies`.
- Summaries: `mcp-agent-mail products summarize-thread MyProduct "br-123" --per-thread-limit 100 --no-llm`.

Server-side tools (for orchestrators) include:

- `ensure_product(product_key|name)`
- `products_link(product_key, project_key)`
- `resource://product/{key}`
- `search_messages_product(product_key, query, limit=20)`

Common pitfalls:

- “from_agent not registered” → call `register_agent` with correct `project_key`.
- `FILE_RESERVATION_CONFLICT` → adjust patterns, wait for expiry, or use non-exclusive reservation.
- Auth issues with JWT+JWKS → bearer token with `kid` matching server JWKS; static bearer only when JWT disabled.

## Issue Tracking with br (beads_rust)

All issue tracking goes through **br**. No other TODO systems.

**Note:** `br` (beads_rust) is non-invasive and never executes git commands directly. You must manually run git operations after `br sync --flush-only`.

Key invariants:

- `.beads/` is authoritative state and **must always be committed** with code changes.
- Do not edit `.beads/*.jsonl` directly; only via `br`.

### Basics

Check ready work:

```bash
br ready --json
```

Create issues:

```bash
br create "Issue title" -t bug|feature|task -p 0-4 --json
br create "Issue title" -p 1 --deps discovered-from:br-123 --json
```

Update:

```bash
br update br-42 --status in_progress --json
br update br-42 --priority 1 --json
```

Complete:

```bash
br close br-42 --reason "Completed" --json
```

Types:

- `bug`, `feature`, `task`, `epic`, `chore`

Priorities:

- `0` critical (security, data loss, broken builds)
- `1` high
- `2` medium (default)
- `3` low
- `4` backlog

Agent workflow:

1. `br ready` to find unblocked work.
2. Claim: `br update <id> --status in_progress`.
3. Implement + test.
4. If you discover new work, create a new bead with `discovered-from:<parent-id>`.
5. Close when done.
6. Commit `.beads/` in the same commit as code changes.

Sync workflow:

- Run `br sync --flush-only` to export to JSONL (does NOT run git commands).
- Then manually run: `git add .beads/ && git commit -m "Update beads" && git push`

Never:

- Use markdown TODO lists.
- Use other trackers.
- Duplicate tracking.

### Using bv as an AI Sidecar

`bv` is a terminal UI + analysis layer for `.beads/issues.jsonl`. It precomputes graph metrics so you don’t have to.

Useful robot commands:

- `bv --robot-help` – overview
- `bv --robot-insights` – graph metrics (PageRank, betweenness, HITS, critical path, cycles)
- `bv --robot-plan` – parallelizable execution plan with unblocks info
- `bv --robot-priority` – priority suggestions with reasoning
- `bv --robot-recipes` – list recipes; apply via `bv --recipe <name>`
- `bv --robot-diff --diff-since <commit|date>` – JSON diff of issue changes

Use `bv` instead of rolling your own dependency graph logic.

### Morph Warp Grep — AI-Powered Code Search

Use `mcp__morph-mcp__warp_grep` for “how does X work?” discovery across the codebase.

When to use:

- You don’t know where something lives.
- You want data flow across multiple files (API → service → schema → types).
- You want all touchpoints of a cross-cutting concern (e.g., moderation, billing).

Example:

```
mcp__morph-mcp__warp_grep(
  repoPath: "/data/projects/communitai",
  query: "How is the L3 Guardian appeals system implemented?"
)
```

Warp Grep:

- Expands a natural-language query to multiple search patterns.
- Runs targeted greps, reads code, follows imports, then returns concise snippets with line numbers.
- Reduces token usage by returning only relevant slices, not entire files.

When **not** to use Warp Grep:

- You already know the function/identifier name; use `rg`.
- You know the exact file; just open it.
- You only need a yes/no existence check.

Comparison:

| Scenario | Tool |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------- |
| “How is auth session validated?” | warp_grep |
| “Where is `handleSubmit` defined?” | `rg` |
| “Replace `var` with `let`” | `ast-grep` |

### cass — Cross-Agent Search

`cass` indexes prior agent conversations (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini, ChatGPT, etc.) so we can reuse solved problems.

Rules:

- Never run bare `cass` (TUI). Always use `--robot` or `--json`.

Examples:

```bash
cass health
cass search "authentication error" --robot --limit 5
cass view /path/to/session.jsonl -n 42 --json
cass expand /path/to/session.jsonl -n 42 -C 3 --json
cass capabilities --json
cass robot-docs guide
```

Tips:

- Use `--fields minimal` for lean output.
- Filter by agent with `--agent`.
- Filter by `--days N` to limit to recent history.

stdout is data-only, stderr is diagnostics; exit code 0 means success.

Treat cass as a way to avoid re-solving problems other agents already handled.

## UBS Quick Reference for AI Agents

UBS stands for "Ultimate Bug Scanner": **The AI Coding Agent's Secret Weapon: Flagging Likely Bugs for Fixing Early On**

**Install:** `curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/main/install.sh | bash`

**Golden Rule:** `ubs --diff .` (or `ubs --staged`) before every commit. Exit 0 = safe. Exit >0 = fix & re-run.

**Commands:**
```bash
ubs --diff --only=js,python .           # Modified files (working tree vs HEAD) — USE THIS
ubs --staged --only=js,python .         # Staged files — before commit
ubs --ci --fail-on-warning --diff .     # CI mode for the diff — before PR
ubs --help                              # Full command reference
ubs sessions --entries 1                # Tail the latest install session log
ubs .                                   # Whole project (ignores things like .venv and node_modules automatically)
```

**Output Format:**
```
⚠️  Category (N errors)
    file.ts:42:5 – Issue description
    💡 Suggested fix
Exit code: 1
```
Parse: `file:line:col` → location | 💡 → how to fix | Exit 0/1 → pass/fail

**Fix Workflow:**
1. Read finding → category + fix suggestion
2. Navigate `file:line:col` → view context
3. Verify real issue (not false positive)
4. Fix root cause (not symptom)
5. Re-run `ubs <file>` → exit 0
6. Commit

**Speed Critical:** Scope to changed files. `ubs --diff .` (fast) vs `ubs .` (slow). Never full scan for small edits.

**Bug Severity:**
- **Critical** (always fix): Null safety, XSS/injection, async/await, memory leaks
- **Important** (production): Type narrowing, division-by-zero, resource leaks
- **Contextual** (judgment): TODO/FIXME, console logs

**Anti-Patterns:**
- ❌ Ignore findings → ✅ Investigate each
- ❌ Full scan per edit → ✅ Scope to file
- ❌ Fix symptom (`if (x) { x.y }`) → ✅ Root cause (`x?.y`)

## ast-grep vs ripgrep (quick guidance)

**Use `ast-grep` when structure matters.** It parses code and matches AST nodes, so results ignore comments/strings, understand syntax, and can **safely rewrite** code.

* Refactors/codemods: rename APIs, change import forms, rewrite call sites or variable kinds.
* Policy checks: enforce patterns across a repo (`scan` with rules + `test`).
* Editor/automation: LSP mode; `--json` output for tooling.

**Use `ripgrep` when text is enough.** It's the fastest way to grep literals/regex across files.

* Recon: find strings, TODOs, log lines, config values, or non-code assets.
* Pre-filter: narrow candidate files before a precise pass.

**Rule of thumb**

* Need correctness over speed, or you'll **apply changes** → start with `ast-grep`.
* Need raw speed or you're just **hunting text** → start with `rg`.
* Often combine: `rg` to shortlist files, then `ast-grep` to match/modify with precision.

**Snippets**

Find structured code (ignores comments/strings):

```bash
ast-grep run -l Python -p 'def $NAME($PARAMS): $$$BODY'
```

Find all async function definitions:

```bash
ast-grep run -l Python -p 'async def $NAME($PARAMS): $$$BODY'
```

Quick textual hunt:

```bash
rg -n 'def .*research' -t py
```

Combine speed + precision:

```bash
rg -l -t py 'pandas' | xargs ast-grep run -l Python -p 'import pandas as $ALIAS' --json
```

**Mental model**

* Unit of match: `ast-grep` = node; `rg` = line.
* False positives: `ast-grep` low; `rg` depends on your regex.
* Rewrites: `ast-grep` first-class; `rg` requires ad-hoc sed/awk and risks collateral edits.

## Beads Workflow Integration

When starting a beads-tracked task:

1. **Pick ready work** (Beads)
   - `br ready --json` → choose one item (highest priority, no blockers)
2. **Reserve edit surface** (Mail)
   - `file_reservation_paths(project_key, agent_name, ["src/**"], ttl_seconds=3600, exclusive=true, reason="br-123")`
3. **Announce start** (Mail)
   - `send_message(..., thread_id="br-123", subject="[br-123] Start: <short title>", ack_required=true)`
4. **Work and update**
   - Reply in-thread with progress and attach artifacts/images; keep the discussion in one thread per issue id
5. **Complete and release**
   - `br close br-123 --reason "Completed"` (Beads is status authority)
   - `release_file_reservations(project_key, agent_name, paths=["src/**"])`
   - Final Mail reply: `[br-123] Completed` with summary and links

Mapping cheat-sheet:
- **Mail `thread_id`** ↔ `br-###`
- **Mail subject**: `[br-###] ...`
- **File reservation `reason`**: `br-###`
- **Commit messages (optional)**: include `br-###` for traceability

## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - `uv run ruff check --fix`, `uv run ty check`
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   br sync --flush-only  # Export to JSONL (does NOT run git commands)
   git add .beads/ && git commit -m "Update beads" && git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds

---

## Note for Codex/GPT-5.2

If you are Codex or GPT-5.2 (or any non-Claude agent): another agent (often Claude Code) may have made changes to the working tree since you last saw it. Before assuming your mental model of the code is correct:

1. Run `git status` to see uncommitted changes
2. Run `git log --oneline -5` to see recent commits
3. Re-read any files you plan to modify

This prevents you from overwriting another agent's work or making edits based on stale context
