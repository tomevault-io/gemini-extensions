# AGENTS.md — LoreWeave Development Guide

> **This is the canonical development guide for LoreWeave — for humans and for AI coding agents alike.**

> A handful of sections reference harness features of a specific agent CLI (`/goal`, `/compact`).

> **Your agent framework is a runner, not a rulebook.** This repo commits the `aif-*` skill pack

> `.claude/`, `.cursor/`, `.codex/`, `.agents/` (Codex app), `.github/skills/` (Copilot) — plus
> `.ai-factory/`. Those decide *how* an agent moves through work; they never decide what this

> *"do not add tests by default"*, which is wrong here, and is overridden.)

## What This Project Is

LoreWeave is a multi-agent platform for multilingual novel workflows (translation, analysis, knowledge building, assisted creation). Cloud-hosted (AWS) monorepo with Docker Compose for local development. Serves multiple users across multiple devices (PC, mobile, tablet).

Source of truth for current status: `docs/sessions/SESSION_HANDOFF.md`

---

## Architecture

Monorepo layout. This lists the **top-level trees**, which are stable; it deliberately does not
enumerate their contents (see Services below for why an inlined service table is a rot hazard).
- `services/` — microservices (Go/Chi, Python/FastAPI, TypeScript/NestJS)
- `crates/` — shared Rust libraries and the simulation/domain kernels
- `pkg/` — shared Go packages
- `sdks/` — reusable language SDKs · `clients/` — typed service clients
- `packages/` — shared TypeScript packages
- `frontend/` — Vite + React + Tailwind + shadcn/ui (novel workflows)
- `frontend-game/` — living-world game client · `cms-frontend/` — admin client
- `contracts/` — OpenAPI, event, schema, registry, and invariant sources of truth
- `migrations/` — repository-level migration assets
- `docs/` — governance, planning, and session docs · `runbooks/` — operational response
- `scripts/` — validation, generation, and operational tooling (the gates live here)
- `infra/` — docker-compose and infra config

### Services

The repo has **47 services** (verify: `ls services/ | wc -l`). This file does **not** enumerate them — the old inlined table went stale and misled agents. **Authoritative service→language map: [`contracts/language-rule.yaml`](contracts/language-rule.yaml); purposes: [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md); frontend feature → route → backing service: [`docs/FEATURE_INDEX.md`](docs/FEATURE_INDEX.md); data layer: [`docs/DATA_ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/DATA_ARCHITECTURE.md).** Language rule: Go = domain/meta · Python = AI/LLM · TS = gateway/realtime · Rust = kernel-derived. Do not assume a service is absent because it's not named here.

Load-bearing facts an agent needs regardless:
- **`provider-registry-service`** is the ONLY home of provider SDKs/keys (Provider-gateway invariant below).
- **`glossary-service`** = authored SSOT for lore AND hosts the **wiki** (`wiki_*` tables — wiki is NOT a separate service). **`knowledge-service`** = derived fuzzy/semantic layer (Postgres SSOT + Neo4j) anchored to glossary via `glossary_entity_id` FK (two-layer pattern; see [scope-separation](docs/standards/scope-separation.md)).
- **`api-gateway-bff`** (TS/NestJS) = external entry point; **`chat`/`translation`/`knowledge`** = Python AI services; **`auth`/`book`/`sharing`/`catalog`/`usage-billing`** = Go domain.
- Data: Postgres (per-service DBs), RabbitMQ (job/event bus + outbox), Redis (cache/rate-limit), MinIO (objects).

### Key Rules
- **📇 Standards index (start here)** — every cross-cutting rule/law/invariant/machine-contract in the repo is catalogued in [`docs/standards/README.md`](docs/standards/README.md): what it governs · where the authoritative source lives · how it's enforced · status. It has a *quick-nav by concern* (building an MCP tool? a dockable panel? a new table? an LLM call?) + a *Known gaps* list, and it **links out — never duplicates**. **Adding/retiring a standard? Update its row there.** The rules below are the always-loaded subset.
- **Non-Vacuity (LOCKED)** — adding or changing a gate, lint, test, `const` assertion, validator, or an axiom that constrains code? Follow [`docs/standards/non-vacuity.md`](docs/standards/non-vacuity.md) (NV-1..6). **A check that cannot fail is not a check — it is a claim wearing the costume of evidence, and it is WORSE than no check, because it reports coverage and silences review.** The obligation is mechanical: **break the guarded thing, watch it go red, put it back, and paste the output** into the VERIFY evidence — *"I added a test"* is not evidence. The four shapes, each with a real occurrence: the **subject cannot vary** (a `size_of` assertion on a boxed payload is 16 bytes for every n) · the **scope never reaches it** (an enumerated file list is *default-uncovered*: what happens to a file created tomorrow?) · **an adjacent decision defeats it** (the hardest — both decisions individually correct; a decoder tolerance broke the store check that depended on it) · the **escape hatch cannot reach its reason** (a fixed one-line pragma window, shipped in three sibling gates). This standard exists because the same defect shipped **twenty-seven** recorded times, **not one caught by the test suite** — twenty-six by someone reading, one by a linter — while three design docs cited a "non-vacuity discipline" that had no home. Two of them landed the day *after* the standard was written, by an author who had it actively in mind: **intent is not a mechanism.**
- **Written artifacts are ENGLISH (LOCKED 2026-07-31)** — **every persisted artifact this repo produces is written in English**: design/architecture/spec/planning docs, `SESSION_HANDOFF`/deferred rows, ADRs, READMEs, code + comments + docstrings, identifiers, log/error messages, commit messages, PR bodies, test names. **Chat with the user is a different thing — answer in whatever language they wrote in.** The artifact is not the conversation.
  - **The failure mode this kills is MIXING, not translation.** The recurring defect is an English document with Vietnamese fragments pasted through it — most often a verbatim PO quote dropped into a design doc, which then makes the surrounding paragraph bilingual. **Quote the MEANING in English** (*"the LLM only helps enrich; how many attributes there are is a bounded proposal surface"*), never paste the original. A doc that needs a bilingual quote to make its point has a translation problem, not a fidelity problem.
  - **Non-English is allowed only where the text IS the subject matter**, not the exposition: corpus/fixture content and the spans cited from it · i18n bundles and translated user-facing strings · test data that exercises CJK/RTL/normalisation · genre/domain terminology with no English equivalent (`築基`, `靈石`, `打坐`) — **gloss it in English on first use**. Everything wrapping that content stays English.
  - Quick check before saving any `docs/**` file: grep it for Vietnamese diacritics. A hit outside a fixture block is a defect.
- **Agent Extensibility Standard** — adding a user/agent-authorable capability (skill, slash command, hook, subagent, MCP-server registration, plugin bundle)? Follow [`docs/standards/agent-extensibility.md`](docs/standards/agent-extensibility.md): the storage→resolver→degrade-safe-consumer→live-E2E shape, validate-parity on import paths, no-silent-no-op (API advertises only what the engine wires), quarantine+scan+SSRF for every external source (verification ≠ safety), and enum-closed-set capability args. Each rule caught a real bug across P0→P5.
- **Settings & Configuration Boundary** — adding *any* configurable behavior (a toggle, mode, threshold, model choice, persona, limit)? Follow [`docs/standards/settings-and-config.md`](docs/standards/settings-and-config.md) (SET-1..8). **Do not abuse a global setting / env var for what is really a per-user choice.** Ask "would two users want different values?" → **yes ⇒ user setting** (a tenancy tier + scope key + the resolution cascade, per User Boundaries), **not** an env flag. Env/global config is reserved for platform-wide, load-bearing infra + **deploy-time ceilings/kill-switches** — and a ceiling is a *max* the user narrows within (`effective = AND(deploy_allows, user_enables)`), **never a per-user knob**. A user setting must: expose its **effective value + source tier** (no silent hidden default — the "grounding always-on / reasoning silently-off" bug class); be **CONSUMED, proven by effect** (a stored-but-unread settings blob is a bug, not a feature — the write-only-behavior bug); enum-validate **closed-set values** on write (Frontend-Tool-Contract discipline); live **server-side** (not localStorage); and have **one home/one name** (consumers inherit, they don't re-store — the model-picked-in-8-places bug). Adding a new global `*_ENABLED`/`*_MODE` env flag that gates *user-facing* behavior is a `/review-impl` finding.
- **Contract-first**: API contract frozen before frontend flow. **Enforced for glossary-service** by
  `TestOpenAPIRouteConformance` (`services/glossary-service/internal/api/route_conformance_test.go`,
  D-GLOSSARY-CONTRACT-FIRST): it `chi.Walk`s the real router + parses `contracts/api/glossary-service/*.yaml`
  and reds on any undocumented public `/v1` route (or phantom documented-but-unrouted path). A new public
  `/v1` route without a contract entry fails CI. It reads the YAML at runtime, so CI runs it with `-count=1`
  (a contract-only edit doesn't recompile the test binary). Add a route → document it, then
  `REGEN_ROUTE_ALLOWLIST=1 go test -run TestOpenAPIRouteConformance` if a deliberate exemption is intended.
  The pattern is reusable for other services.
- **Gateway invariant**: all external traffic through `api-gateway-bff` — with ONE sanctioned exception (PRR-20): the `game-server` real-time WebSocket transport (Colyseus) is a second public entry point that inherits the same auth/rate-limit/audit edge controls. See `docs/03_planning/LLM_MMO_RPG/00_foundation/02_invariants.md` I1 amendment.
- **MCP-first invariant (AI agent logic)** — *any* AI **agent** capability (logic where an LLM decides actions, calls tools, or reasons multi-step over tools/data) MUST be exposed and invoked as an **MCP tool-call through `ai-gateway`** — never a bespoke HTTP endpoint driven by a raw prompt. **If the tool doesn't exist, create it** as an MCP tool on the owning domain service (domain owns its tools; `ai-gateway` only federates/routes — see `docs/specs/2026-06-10-glossary-assistant-architecture.md`). Non-agentic LLM *pipelines* (e.g. translation, enrichment) are exempt, but **new** agentic logic is not. Legacy agentic logic still on HTTP/raw-prompt is **tracked for migration in Deferred**, never silently grandfathered.
- **Provider gateway invariant (ENFORCED)** — NO service imports a provider SDK or calls a provider API directly; every LLM/embedding/**rerank**/image/audio/STT call goes through **`provider-registry-service`** (the only place provider SDKs/HTTP live). Verified held across all AI services 2026-06-10. Any new direct provider SDK import is a defect, not a shortcut.
  - **Local/self-hosted model backends are NOT an exception** — a sibling local service (e.g. `local-rerank-service` :28417, `local-stt-service`, `local-tts-service`, ollama/lm_studio) is reached **only** as a **BYOK provider credential through provider-registry** (`user_models` JOIN `provider_credentials`: kind + `endpoint_base_url` + secret), never via direct `*_URL`/`*_MODEL`/`*_SERVICE_TOKEN` platform config in a consuming service. This is the exact mistake `D-RERANK-NOT-BYOK` fixed: rerank was first wired as platform config in knowledge-service (RERANK_URL/MODEL/SERVICE_TOKEN) instead of resolving the user's model via provider-registry like embed. **Adding a new model capability or a new local backend → register it as a provider-registry credential + a `user_models` row (capability flag, pricing), and resolve it via an `/internal/*` provider-registry route. Do NOT add a per-service URL/token env var for a model backend.**
- **No hardcoded model names (ENFORCED)** — model names *and pricing* resolve from `provider-registry-service`, never literal in service runtime code (exceptions: provider-registry's own preconfig/pricing, and test fixtures). On a violation: fix now if cheap, else add a Deferred migration row — never leave it untracked.
- **Provider-rule gate** — the two ENFORCED rules above are checked programmatically by `scripts/ai-provider-gate.py` (cross-platform; provider-SDK imports for Py/TS/Go + hardcoded model literals, with an allowlist + DEFERRED tracking). Wired as a **pre-commit** hook via `git config core.hooksPath .githooks` (run once per checkout); CI/manual: `python scripts/ai-provider-gate.py`. Known-deferred drift is allowlisted (see DEFERRED 065); a genuinely new legacy case must get a DEFERRED row + an explicit allowlist entry, never an untracked bypass.
- **Language rule** (I3, amended & LOCKED 2026-05-29): **Rust** for kernel-derived services (world/travel/tilemap, the DP-kernel consumers), **Go** for domain + meta services, **Python** for AI/LLM services, **TypeScript** for gateway/BFF + realtime transport. The authoritative service→language map is `contracts/language-rule.yaml`, enforced by `scripts/language-rule-lint.sh` (FAILs on mismatch, on a present service mapped `missing`, and on a present service with no row). See `docs/plans/2026-05-29-foundation-mega-task/I3_INVARIANT_AMENDMENT.md` §5.
- Each microservice owns its own Postgres database. **Owning it means no one else reads or writes it** — reach another service's data through its contract, its typed client, an MCP tool, or an event, never by connecting to its database. `knowledge-access-gate.py` enforces this mechanically for the two substrates it has already cost us (the glossary EAV and Neo4j); for every other service the rule is currently carried by review, so do not read the absence of a gate as permission.
- **No hardcoded secrets** — all secrets via env vars, services fail to start if missing
- **Destructive DB ops in tests (ENFORCED) — a test must NEVER be able to wipe a real database.** A DB-gated test's UNSCOPED `DELETE FROM books` cleanup once ran against the real `loreweave_book` (its `*_TEST_DATABASE_URL` was pointed there) and **hard-deleted every user's books** — no trash, no owner scope, unrecoverable. Three layers now prevent the whole class: (1) **this rule**; (2) **`scripts/db-safety-gate.py`** (pre-commit) — blocks an unscoped `DELETE`/`TRUNCATE`/`DROP TABLE` in a test file, or a `*_TEST_*_URL` pointing at a bare production DB name; (3) a **runtime guard that lives INSIDE the helper, not at the call sites** — Go `testsafe.EnsureThrowawayDB(current_database())`, Python `_guard_throwaway(dsn)` — which refuses any DB whose name lacks a throwaway marker (`test`/`smoke`/`audit`/…). **Put the guard in the shared helper (`mustApply`, `applyDDL`, the DB fixture), never in the tests that call it.** When it sat in one of two sibling helpers, four harnesses used the unguarded one and applied `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS events` against whatever the DSN pointed at — not by decision, but because *calling a helper that skips a safety check looks exactly like calling one that performs it*. A check you have to remember is default-uncovered. Corollary: **never reimplement a helper inline** — an admin-cli test had copied `applyDDL`'s read-and-retry body verbatim, identical except for the guard. Rules for any DB-gated test: **scope every cleanup** (`WHERE owner_user_id=$1`), never `DELETE FROM <table>` bare; read the DSN **only** from a dedicated `*_TEST_*` var (**never** fall back to the production `*_DB_URL`); a throwaway DB name **must** carry a marker — including databases a test creates itself, since `testsafe` classifies by name and `loreweave_meta_lifecycle` reads as production; and **guard before you destroy**. To prove a guard works, point it at an **empty decoy DB with a production-shaped name**, never at a real one. A real false positive gets an inline `db-safety-gate: ok — <reason>` (or `guarded-dir` in the dir's conftest). Bypass only in a true emergency with `--no-verify`.

### Frontend Architecture Rules (React MVC)

React merges logic and view — we impose MVC separation ourselves:

**File structure per feature:**
```
features/<name>/
  hooks/        ← "controllers" — own logic + state, no JSX
  context/      ← "services" — shared state across components
  components/   ← "views" — render only, receive data from context/props
  api.ts        ← API layer
  types.ts      ← TypeScript types
```

**Which `<name>`? → [`docs/FEATURE_INDEX.md`](docs/FEATURE_INDEX.md)** — all 41 feature folders, each with its route, purpose, and the service it actually talks to. Check it **before** adding a feature folder (the concept may already have a home) and **update it in the same commit** when you add one. The gateway path does NOT reliably name the owning service — `/v1/glossary-translate` and `/v1/extraction` both hit translation-service, `/v1/worlds` hits book-service. Don't infer; look it up.

⚠️ **Two unrelated trees are called "features".** `frontend/src/features/*` = shipped UI (index above). `docs/03_planning/LLM_MMO_RPG/features/*` = design docs for the unbuilt MMO track ([its own index](docs/03_planning/LLM_MMO_RPG/features/_index.md)). Neither indexes the other.

**Rules:**
- **Separation of concerns** — components render, hooks own logic, context shares state. No API calls or business logic inside components.
- **Never conditionally unmount stateful components** — use CSS `hidden` or internal branching. Ternary rendering (`{cond ? <A/> : <B/>}`) destroys hook state, AudioContext, WebSocket connections, etc.
- **No useEffect for event handling** — useEffect is for synchronization (subscriptions, timers), NOT for reacting to user actions or state changes. Use explicit callback handlers instead. The pattern `useEffect(() => { if (prev && !current) doSomething() }, [current])` is always wrong — call `doSomething()` directly where the state change originates.
- **Split context by update frequency** — separate stable context (session, config — changes rarely) from volatile context (streaming text — changes every frame). Putting both in one context forces all consumers to re-render on every SSE chunk.
- **No prop-drilling middlemen** — if a component exists only to pass props through to children, replace it with context or flatten the tree.
- **Hooks must be self-contained** — a custom hook should own its state, effects, and cleanup. It should not require the parent component to manage its lifecycle via useEffect.
- **Max ~100 lines per component, ~200 per hook** — if larger, split. A component with 12+ concerns is a code smell.

### Frontend-Tool Contract (agent→GUI tools — LOCKED)

Full standard: [`docs/standards/mcp-tool-io.md`](docs/standards/mcp-tool-io.md) (inputs IN-1..8 + outputs OUT-1..6). Essentials: a frontend tool (`ui_open_studio_panel`, `propose_edit`, `confirm_action`, …) spans **2 services / 2 languages** joined only by the LLM — BE schema `chat-service/app/services/frontend_tools.py` ↔ FE resolver `frontend/src/features/**`. So a drift/free-string/silent-no-op passes unit tests yet kills the live loop (shipped once: `panel_id` had no enum → gemma sent `panel:"editor"` → silent no-op → hallucinated success). Rules: **closed-set arg ⇒ `enum`** (register in `CLOSED_SET_ARGS`); **resolver never silently no-ops** (return `result.error`); **one name for one concept**; **machine-checked both sides** via `contracts/frontend-tools.contract.json` (change a schema → `WRITE_FRONTEND_CONTRACT=1 pytest` + update the resolver, or a test reds); **verify by EFFECT** (live browser smoke, not raw-stream).

### Data Persistence Rules
- **Server is the source of truth** — all user data in Postgres, all files in S3/MinIO
- **No localStorage for user data** — localStorage is ONLY a fast cache for preferences that are also synced to server via `/v1/me/preferences`
- **Multi-device support** — user logs in on any device, sees the same data. Nothing stored only locally.
- **UI state that must persist** — save to DB (e.g., last active session, reading position). NOT localStorage.
- **UI state that is per-device** — OK in localStorage (e.g., sidebar collapsed, editor panel widths)
- **Preferences** — read from server on login, write-through to server on change, localStorage as cache only

### Hosting Model
- **Cloud-hosted on AWS** (ECS/EC2, RDS, S3, ElastiCache) — NOT local-machine-only
- **Docker Compose for development** — same services, same architecture, local ports
- **Self-hosted does NOT mean local PC** — it means user controls the infrastructure (could be AWS, GCP, VPS, homelab)
- **Multi-device, multi-user** — design for users accessing from PC, phone, tablet simultaneously
- **No platform lock-in** — no Vercel, no Cloudflare-specific APIs. Standard Docker + Postgres + S3

### User Boundaries & Tenancy (LOCKED — read before designing ANY feature)

**Root-cause note:** early in this project the agent conflated "self-hosted" with "single-user" and designed features with **no user boundary** — shared rows any user could mutate for everyone (the canonical bug: `glossary_entities`'s `entity_kinds` were *globally unique + user-mutable*, so one user editing a "kind" changed it for all users). **Self-hosted ≠ single-user.** Every deployment is **multi-tenant**: many users, each with private data, sharing one DB and one set of system defaults.

**The scoping tiers — every user-facing resource MUST declare which tier it belongs to:**

| Tier | Owner | Who may WRITE | Visible to | Example |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **System** | the platform | **admin only** (never a regular user) | everyone (read-only) | default entity-kinds, the 12 seeded glossary kinds, pricing presets |
| **Per-user** | a `user_id` | that user | that user (+ collaborators they grant) | a user's custom glossary kinds, BYOK credentials, preferences |
| **Per-book** (or per-project/per-resource) | a `book_id`/`project_id` | the owner + grantees (E0 grants) | the owner + grantees | book-specific kinds, glossary entities, campaigns |

**Hard rules:**
- **A regular user MUST NOT mutate a System-tier (shared/global) row.** System defaults are seeded + admin-managed; users *clone* or *override* them into their own per-user/per-book tier, never edit the shared original. A write endpoint on a shared resource that any authenticated user can call is a **tenancy defect**, not a feature.
- **Every table holding user-customizable data carries a scope key** — `owner_user_id` and/or `book_id` — and **every query filters by it**. A `UNIQUE(code)` on a shared table (no scope column) is the smell that produced the kinds bug; the correct constraint is `UNIQUE(owner_user_id, code)` / `UNIQUE(book_id, code)`.
- **Cross-tenant access is grant-gated, never implicit** — sharing happens only through the E0 collaboration grants (see the Gateway/grants invariants), never by a global row everyone can see/edit.
- **Resolution merges tiers, lowest-precedence first:** System (defaults) → Per-user (the user's overrides/additions) → Per-book (book-specific). Higher tiers shadow lower by `code`.

**Design checklist (apply to every new feature before building):** Who owns each row? What is its scope key? Can user A's action affect user B's data or view? If a "shared" or "global" resource is user-editable, STOP — it almost certainly needs a per-user/per-book tier instead, with System read-only + admin-only writes.

## Test Parallelization (dev speed — adopted 2026-07-03)

Python suites run under **pytest-xdist**: `python -m pytest tests -q -n auto --dist loadgroup`
(install once per machine: `python -m pip install pytest-xdist`). Measured: composition
1472 tests 418s→55s; translation full suite 37s. Rules:
- **Pass `--dist loadgroup`** — tests hitting the shared dev Postgres carry
  `pytestmark = pytest.mark.xdist_group("pg")` (serialized onto one worker). A NEW test file
  that touches a real DB/port MUST add that mark, or parallel workers interleave and counts lie.
- **EXCEPT composition-service, which uses `--dist load`** (2026-08-01). Its `tests/conftest.py`
  gives every xdist worker its OWN database (`…_s1test_gw0`, `_gw1`, …, created on demand from
  `PYTEST_XDIST_WORKER`), so the reason to serialise the group is gone and the marks are inert.
  **Measured, clean, identical results either way: 508.4s → 106.6s (4.8×)**; the pg
  group alone 495.5s → 51.5s. (The 11 pre-existing failures this line used to cite are gone —
  re-measured 2026-08-03: **3652 passed, 403 skipped, 0 failed**. A number in a document is a
  claim with an expiry date; re-measure before repeating one.) The conftest no-ops when `PYTEST_XDIST_WORKER` is unset, so serial
  runs and CI (which runs this suite serially, on purpose) are unaffected.
  It also memoises `run_migrations` per schema-fingerprint — worth ~48s, and far less than the
  arithmetic suggested; the parallelisation is the lever that matters. A test whose SUBJECT is
  the migration runner must import `run_migrations_uncached` (see `test_package_rekey.py`).
- **Don't run the full suite while iterating** — that was the real cost, not the suite. Use `-k`
  subsets during BUILD; the full `-n auto` run is the VERIFY gate. And never run two suites
  against the SAME test DB at once: it produces failures that look like code defects (measured
  2026-08-01 — a contaminated run showed 14 failed + 24 errors against a true 11).
- Cross-service: run each service's suite as a parallel background task; ONE combined verify
  before commit when multiple services changed.

---

## Sub-agent Fan-out — the cost discipline (LOCKED — adopted 2026-07-13)

**The incident this exists to prevent.** A planning run fanned out **605 sub-agents** and burned
**~45M tokens** adjudicating 580 open questions — **one agent per question**. It hit the session limit
and died, and the answers it did produce were **no better than ~10 agents grouped by file** would have
given. A later run doing the same *class* of work with **4 agents grouped by file** cost **864k tokens**
— **~52× cheaper, same quality**. The waste was **not** the volume of work. It was the **shape of the
fan-out**.

### Why a sub-agent is expensive in a way that is easy to miss

The main session has a **1M context with prompt caching** (1-hour TTL): once a file is read, re-reasoning
over it is nearly free, and every subsequent turn re-uses the cache. **A sub-agent starts COLD.** It
shares none of that cache. It pays **full price** to re-read the same specs, the same plan, the same
source files — and then it pays again to write its result back into the parent.

⇒ **N sub-agents over the same corpus = N × full-price reads, with zero cache re-use.** This is why
per-item fan-out explodes: 580 agents each re-read the same 5 plan documents to answer one question about
them. Grouping by file reads each document **once**.

### The rule

**Solo-in-the-1M-context is the DEFAULT.** Fan out only when the work clears a bar — and say the estimate
out loud before you do.

**Fan out when:**
- The slices are over **genuinely disjoint inputs** (different services, different files) — each agent
  reads *different* bytes, so there is no cache to have re-used anyway.
- You need **independent judgement** (adversarial verify, a judge panel, a cold-start review). Here the
  isolation *is* the product — a fresh agent that cannot see your reasoning is the point.
- The corpus **genuinely exceeds** what one context can hold.
- Parallel **wall-clock** actually matters and the work is long-running.

**Do NOT fan out when:**
- 🔴 **The unit is an ITEM, not a FILE.** One agent per question / per finding / per gap / per row is the
  anti-pattern. **Group by file, by domain, or by disjoint slice — never by list element.**
- The answer is **greppable**. If `grep`/`Read` settles it, just do it. Spawning an agent to run a grep
  you could run yourself costs ~1000× the grep.
- All the agents would **read the same files** to answer different questions about them. That is one
  agent's job, done once.
- It is a **conversational or trivial** turn.

### Before every fan-out, state this

> *"N agents, each reading ⟨what⟩, because ⟨why one agent can't⟩."*

If you cannot fill in *"why one agent can't"*, **don't fan out**.

### Under `ultracode`

`ultracode` removes **cost** as a constraint. It does **not** license **waste**. 605 agents producing what
10 would produce is not thoroughness — it is a broken fan-out shape, and it *lowers* quality by dying
mid-run. Exhaustive means **cover everything once**, not **read everything N times**. The granularity
rule above holds regardless.

## Session Protocol

### Session Start (every session)

1. **Read** `docs/sessions/SESSION_HANDOFF.md` — read the **▶ NEXT SESSION** block at the top
2. **Check** the relevant planning doc in `docs/03_planning/` for whatever module you're working on
3. For data layer orientation (SSOT, DB ownership, flows), read `docs/DATA_ARCHITECTURE.md`
4. Orient with Glob/Grep/Read — there is no external memory service; the repo's own docs are the memory

### Session End

Overwrite the **▶ NEXT SESSION** block in `docs/sessions/SESSION_HANDOFF.md` in place:
- Update header (date, HEAD, session number)
- Replace NEXT items with what's actually next
- Update Deferred list (clear resolved rows, add new ones)
- Keep the file short — append historical detail to `<details>` blocks or archive it

### Session continuity — do NOT suggest restarting

A commit is a **task checkpoint, not a session boundary**. Once code is committed, the next task continues in the *same* session.

- **Do NOT** suggest opening a new session, "starting fresh", pausing, or "wrapping up" based on commit count, number of milestones done, elapsed time, or conversation length. None of these are reasons to stop.
- This matters most during **multi-milestone runs**: after each milestone commits, just present the close-out and continue to the next one — never advise a new session in between.
- Only mention context at all when it is **genuinely near full (>90% used)**. At normal usage (e.g. a 1M window with most of it free) context is a non-issue — say nothing about it.
- If compaction is truly needed, run `/compact`. Do not ask the user to restart.

The legitimate stop points are the workflow's own PO checkpoints (CLARIFY end, POST-REVIEW) and the user explicitly saying they're done — nothing else.

### Long autonomous runs — the GOAL COMMITMENT (anti-drift) — MANDATORY

Before any long / multi-phase / unattended run (a multi-milestone build track, an autonomous
implementation), **establish an explicit GOAL first — it is a commitment between the human and the agent, and
the agent must ASK for it, never invent it.** A run with no agreed finish line drifts by construction.

> **Tool-specific notation.** `/goal`, `/compact`, `/loop` below are features of one agent CLI
> (Claude Code). If your tooling has no equivalent, the substance still holds: **write the finish
> condition down before you start, put the proof in a file, and let a script — not your memory —
> enforce phase order.** Layers 2 and 3 in the table below are tool-neutral and do the real work.

**1 · Ask, then set `/goal`** (Claude Code ≥ v2.1.139 — condition-based; the session keeps working across
turns until a fast evaluator says the condition holds). The agent asks the human what "done" means, proposes
a precise condition, and the human sets it. One goal per session; `/goal` = status, `/goal clear` = stop.
(`/loop` is a *time-interval* re-run — the wrong tool for "until done".)

**2 · Know the evaluator's blind spot — this is the whole reason for the rest of this section.** The `/goal`
evaluator **reads the transcript only. It cannot run commands or read files.** So it is satisfied by the agent
*claiming* a check passed. **`/goal` enforces persistence, not honesty.** Therefore:

- **Write the condition so it forces the proof INTO the transcript** ("the transcript contains the actual
  pasted output of X"; "claiming a check passed without pasting its output does NOT satisfy this condition").
- **Bound it** (`or stop after N turns`).

**3 · Layer the enforcement — a goal alone is not enough.** Drift in a long run is rarely "forgot the task";
it is **silently lowering the bar** (skipping `/review-impl`, treating a green unit test as proof of a
behavior it never exercised, marking a slice done whose live-smoke never ran). Use all three:

| Layer | Enforces | Can the agent talk past it? |
|---|---|---|
| `/goal` condition | persistence + a fresh-model completion check | **yes** (transcript-only evaluator) |
| **A RUN-STATE file on disk** (the commitment, the invariants, the slice board where *done* = an evidence string, + registers for decisions/parked/debt/drift) | memory across compaction | no — it is a file |
| **Rule-based scripts** — the pre-commit hook (`git config core.hooksPath .githooks`) + `scripts/workflow-gate.py` | phase order, VERIFY/POST-REVIEW evidence, the repo invariants | **no** — mechanical |

**4 · Re-read the commitment, don't remember it.** Context is lossy (compaction summarizes; anything living
only in the conversation can evaporate). **After every compaction: re-read the RUN-STATE file first**, then
`git log`, then continue. Keep the RUN-STATE path in the TODO list — the harness re-surfaces todos, so it is
the anchor that survives. **Never re-litigate a sealed decision from memory; re-read it.**

**5 · Blocked ≠ stopped.** If the human has granted an autonomous run: park an unsolvable problem in the
RUN-STATE register, move to other work, and keep going. Stop and ask **only** when an action is
destructive/irreversible or a sealed decision turns out to be wrong.

**6 · The registers make the final audit a byproduct.** Append decisions · parked · debt · drift as you go.
**A run that ends with an empty drift log is not clean — it is dishonest.** Record the near-misses.

---

## Agent memory — it is the repo, not a service

**There is no external memory/lesson service.** An optional ContextHub MCP server used to be listed
here (`http://localhost:3000/mcp`) for persistent lessons, semantic code search, and guardrails.
**No agent ever actually called it** — it was configuration that looked like a capability — so on
2026-08-03 the server registration, the four client scripts, and the workflow-gate bridge were all
removed. Do not re-add an integration like it without a consumer that demonstrably reads it; an
unused memory backend is worse than none, because it invites agents to assume a lookup happened.

What actually carries memory across sessions, in the order to consult it:

| Need | Where |
|---|---|
| What is in flight, what is deferred | [`docs/sessions/SESSION_HANDOFF.md`](docs/sessions/SESSION_HANDOFF.md) |
| A cross-cutting rule | [`docs/standards/README.md`](docs/standards/README.md) |
| Why a past decision was made | `docs/specs/`, `docs/plans/`, then `git log` |
| Code location | Glob / Grep / Read |
| Phase + evidence history of past runs | `docs/audit/AUDIT_LOG.jsonl` (append-only; the AMAW writer was retired 2026-08-03, the record stays) |

**A lesson that is not written into one of those files does not survive the session.** That is the
whole reason the SESSION phase is mandatory — and the removal above is the proof. A handful of
citations to the retired store survive as **dangling provenance**: `ContextHub lesson L-CH-01/02/03/07`
in `knowledge-service` docstrings and `lesson e16b6f02` in `scripts/check_stack_freshness.py`. The
reasoning they cite is spelled out inline right where they appear, so nothing is lost — but the
identifiers now resolve to nothing. **Cite the reasoning, not a lookup key in a system that can be
switched off.**

---

## Phase Checkpoint Protocol

Update `docs/sessions/SESSION_HANDOFF.md` at meaningful phase boundaries:

| Trigger | Action |
|---|---|
| A module backend/frontend completes | Update NEXT block + Deferred list |
| A new blocker is discovered | Add to Deferred with category |
| A blocker is resolved | Move to "Recently cleared" or delete |
| A code review intentionally postpones a fix | Add to **Deferred Items** |

**Rule:** if you complete more than one commit's worth of work, update SESSION_HANDOFF before moving to the next phase.

---

## No Deadline · No Defer Drift

LoreWeave is a hobby project with **no fixed deadline**. This shapes how reviews and planning work:

- **Don't rush past quality issues.** A second-pass code review after every BUILD is mandatory, not optional. If you find a bug or smell, fix it now unless it genuinely belongs in a later phase.

- **FIX-NOW is the default; deferral is the exception that must EARN its row.** The Deferred
  list is not a parking lot for every finding — it exists only for work that genuinely cannot be
  resolved in the current run. Tracking is mandatory (a deferral must never be silently dropped),
  but tracking is *not* a licence to defer. A defer row carries ongoing cost: it's re-read at
  every PLAN and re-evaluated every session. **If fixing the bug is cheaper than writing +
  carrying its defer row, just fix it.** Small, in-scope, root-cause-clear bugs (a wrong
  condition, a misleading message, a missing guard, a one-file logic error) are fix-now — even if
  found late in a run. Writing a defer row for a one-line fix is the anti-pattern this rule kills.

- **Defer-eligibility gate — a finding may be deferred ONLY if it meets at least one of:**
  1. **Out of scope** — belongs to a different branch/module/track than the one in flight (fixing it here would scope-creep the current effort).
  2. **Large / structural** — the correct fix needs a refactor, a schema/DB migration, a new feature, or touches a cross-service contract — i.e. it needs a *serious plan*, not a quick edit.
  3. **Naturally-next-phase** — it is genuinely implementable only when a later phase begins (its prerequisites don't exist yet).
  4. **Blocked / unresolvable now** — waiting on a *genuinely external* dependency (another team's
     unreleased work, an upstream API that doesn't exist), a product decision, or profiling
     evidence (perf items: fix when profiling shows pain).
  5. **Conscious won't-fix** — a deliberate decision to not fix, recorded so it stops re-surfacing.

  If a finding fits **none** of these, it is NOT eligible to defer — fix it this run. When in
  doubt between "small enough to fix now" and "large enough to defer", **fix it now**; only the
  things that clearly clear the gate above earn a row.

- **"Missing infrastructure" is NOT "blocked" — it is unbuilt work to implement (LOCKED — the
  anti-laziness rule).** Gate #4 is the one most often abused. A feature that needs a new module,
  extractor, schema, or service-side piece that *you could write in this repo* is **buildable**, not
  blocked — it just hasn't been built yet. Before you ever label something "blocked" or defer it as
  "needs X that doesn't exist":
  1. **Verify the claim against code**, don't trust a handoff/doc note (those go stale — a "blocked
     on the missing route" item this project shipped twice turned out to *already exist*).
  2. **Check for the signal/seam** the build needs (e.g. does the row carry a `summary` field an LLM
     could classify from? does a sibling extractor/pattern already exist to mirror?). If the signal
     exists and the pattern exists, it is buildable — **scope it and implement it.**
  3. **Decompose** a "blocked" item into the buildable slice + the genuinely-external remainder. Most
     "blocked" items are mostly buildable now with a small truly-external tail (or no tail at all).
  Only a dependency that is *external to this repo and you cannot write* clears gate #4. "It's a big
  new track" is gate #2 (large/structural — write a plan), **not** "blocked". Saying "blocked" when
  you mean "I'd have to build it" is the lazy tell this rule exists to kill.

- **A deferral that passes the gate gets a tracked row** in the **Deferred Items** section of
  `docs/sessions/SESSION_HANDOFF.md` (and `docs/deferred/DEFERRED.md`): ID, origin
  phase, description, the gate reason (which of 1–5), and target phase/trigger.

- **…and a row is not enough. A tracked deferral needs a MECHANISM (ENFORCED on the game tier).**
  Measured 2026-07-29: **9 of 19** game-tier deferrals were *prose only* — a row and nothing else —
  and in that single day the project produced `D-PUBLISHER-DROPS-RULESET-PIN` cited as an open
  blocker in **four** places *after it was fixed* (including the row of the task fixing it), six CI
  legs red on `main` for four days, a test that could never un-skip, and four rows fixed in the
  morning and still listed as open in the afternoon. What survived instead was, without exception,
  mechanical. **Intent is not a mechanism.** So every id inside a
  `<!-- deferral-registry:begin/end -->` block must either be **named by non-comment source** (an
  asserted trigger that reds when its subject arrives, a `KNOWN_RED` row, a test named for it) or
  carry a `PROSE_ONLY` row in **`scripts/deferral-gate.py`** saying **what would wake it up**.
  Enforced pre-commit + CI. Two traps it exists to catch, both real: a `// TODO(D-…)` comment, a
  JSDoc header and a module **docstring** are *prose that happens to live in a source file* and do
  **not** count (this certified three prose-only deferrals as covered before the stripper was
  fixed); and a **pragma is an exemption, not a mechanism** — it silences a finding and keeps
  silencing it after the debt is paid. The registry **shrinks**: a `PROSE_ONLY` row fails when its
  id becomes mechanised or leaves the block.
- **At every PLAN phase, read the Deferred Items section.** Any row whose Target phase equals the current phase is a must-do for that phase.
- **Whenever a deferral is cleared, move it to "Recently cleared"** (or delete after a few sessions). The list should shrink as often as it grows — if it's only growing, the gate above is being applied too loosely.
- **Avoid the "we'll come back to it" trap.** "Skip if time is tight" is a yellow flag — there is no time pressure here. Either it clears the defer gate, or it's a real bug to fix now.

## Task Workflow

**Bundle v2.3** — human-in-loop, with PO checkpoints at CLARIFY end and POST-REVIEW. Full prose in [`agentic-workflow/WORKFLOW.md`](agentic-workflow/WORKFLOW.md). This section captures only what the agent must keep loaded at all times.

**Default mode (v2.2):** human-in-loop with PO checkpoints at CLARIFY end + POST-REVIEW.
**Retired 2026-08-03: AMAW mode.** Its cold-start sub-agent reviews are covered by AI Factory's read-only sidecars (`review-sidecar`, `security-sidecar`, `rules-sidecar`, `best-practices-sidecar`) and by `/review-impl +check`. **One behaviour did NOT survive the swap:** AMAW's Scope Guard was a *blocking* gate at POST-REVIEW; the sidecars are advisors. POST-REVIEW is still a human checkpoint and that is now the only thing that blocks there.

### 12 phases

```
CLARIFY → DESIGN → REVIEW → PLAN → BUILD → VERIFY → REVIEW → QC → POST-REVIEW → SESSION → COMMIT → RETRO
```

| Phase | Role |
|---|---|
| 1. CLARIFY | Architect + PO |
| 2. DESIGN | Lead |
| 3. REVIEW (design) | PO + Lead self-review |
| 4. PLAN | Lead + Developer |
| 5. BUILD | Developer (TDD) |
| 6. VERIFY | Developer (evidence gate) |
| 7. REVIEW (code) | Lead self-review |
| 8. QC | QA / PO |
| 9. POST-REVIEW | Human checkpoint — present + WAIT |
| 10. SESSION | Developer |
| 11. COMMIT | Developer |
| 12. RETRO | All — record the lesson in the repo |

**Status markers:** `[ ]` not started · `[C/D/P/B/V/R/Q/PR/S]` in phase · `[x]` done. **Task types:** `[FE]` frontend · `[BE]` backend · `[FS]` full-stack.

### Repo-specific paths (workflow artifacts)

| Artifact | Path |
|---|---|
| Main session notes | `docs/sessions/SESSION_HANDOFF.md` |
| Design-track session notes | `docs/03_planning/<TRACK>/SESSION_HANDOFF.md` |
| New specs (CLARIFY) | `docs/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md` (or `docs/03_planning/<TRACK>/` for legacy tracks) |
| New plans (PLAN) | `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature>.md` (or `docs/03_planning/<TRACK>/`) |
| Audit log (historical) | `docs/audit/AUDIT_LOG.jsonl` (append-only, committed) |
| Deferred items | `docs/deferred/DEFERRED.md` |
| RETRO lessons | `docs/sessions/SESSION_HANDOFF.md`, or the standard/spec the lesson amends |

### Task Size Classification (MANDATORY — before work begins)

**Size by COMPLEXITY + RISK, not file count** (2026-06-12 redesign). The old file-count
table over-sized wide-but-shallow changes (one param added across 12 files read as XL),
fragmenting coherent work into needless ceremony on a large-context window. The axes:

- **Logic** = distinct **semantic** changes (new behaviors, contracts, branches) — the **primary** axis.
- **Side effects** = API/DB/config/migration/auth — **risk**; sets a hard **floor** (undersizing can't cross it).
- **Files** = a **breadth** signal only. A mechanical sweep (low logic-per-file) does **NOT** escalate; breadth bumps size **one tier** only when the change is genuinely deep across it (`logic ≳ files`).

| Size | Logic (primary) | Risk floor | Allowed skips |
|------|-----------------|-----------|---------------|
| **XS** | 0-1 | no side effects | CLARIFY + PLAN |
| **S** | 2-3 | ≥1 side effect ⇒ min S | PLAN only |
| **M** | 4-6 | ≥2 side effects ⇒ min M | None |
| **L** | 7-12 | Yes | None — write plan file |
| **XL** | 13+ | Yes | None — write spec + plan; subagent recommended |

**Classify the whole EFFORT, not each sub-task.** A coherent multi-part change (e.g. a
re-arch spanning several services) is ONE classification + ONE continuous run — not N
small tasks each with its own size→build→review→commit cycle. Undersizing on **breadth**
is allowed (the gate warns, you proceed); undersizing below the **risk floor** is blocked.

**Budget-driven checkpoint cadence (the big unlock).** On a large-context model, let the
**context budget** — not file count — drive when to stop. Pass current context % as the
5th arg: `size <S> <files> <logic> <side_effects> <context_pct>`.
- **Ample budget (<~70%):** run continuously. Checkpoint/commit at genuine **risk boundaries**
  (a new contract, a migration, a cross-service seam, a shippable milestone), **not** at
  arbitrary file/sub-task counts.
- **Filling (>~80%):** checkpoint/commit + `/compact` at the next risk boundary.
- **PO checkpoints (CLARIFY end + POST-REVIEW) are BATCHED per-milestone:** one CLARIFY for
  the effort's scope; POST-REVIEW at each shippable risk boundary — not per sub-task.
- **Quality gates stay, applied per-milestone:** VERIFY evidence, 2-stage REVIEW, live-smoke
  (≥2 services), `/review-impl` for load-bearing code. These caught real bugs; keep them.

**ENFORCEMENT** — state machine (`.workflow-state.json`) + pre-commit hook block phase jumps and commits without VERIFY+POST-REVIEW+SESSION evidence:

```bash
./scripts/workflow-gate.sh size M 3 4 0 45      # Classify (files=3 logic=4 se=0, context=45%)
./scripts/workflow-gate.sh phase build          # Enter phase
./scripts/workflow-gate.sh complete build "tests pass"  # Mark done with evidence
./scripts/workflow-gate.sh status               # Check progress
```

The `.sh` is a thin wrapper around `scripts/workflow-gate.py` (cross-platform; sidesteps the Windows pyenv-win shim bug that broke the prior all-bash impl).

### Anti-Skip Rules

- Agent **never** self-authorizes a skip — STOP, announce the skip attempt, ask user.
- If during BUILD you discover the task is larger than classified — STOP, reclassify, announce.
- Common skip patterns and why each is a violation: see [`agentic-workflow/WORKFLOW.md`](agentic-workflow/WORKFLOW.md) "Anti-Skip Rules" table.
- **Decompose a chained shell operation into separately reviewable commands.** `git checkout main && git pull` is one approval covering two actions, and the human reviewing it sees the first. Run `git checkout main`, then `git pull origin main`. This matters most where the second half is the destructive one — the chain is how an unreviewed `reset`/`clean`/`rm` rides in behind a benign first command.

### Role Perspectives (default mode)

When playing each role, shift perspective — don't just check boxes:

| Role | Thinks about... |
|------|-----------------|
| **Architect** | System boundaries, dependencies, scoping, impact |
| **PO** | User value, acceptance criteria, design sign-off, final QC |
| **Lead** | Technical design, plan quality, code review (patterns, security, a11y) |
| **Developer** | Correctness, TDD, efficiency, verification, session tracking |
| **QA** | What can break — edge cases, regression, acceptance criteria |

### Phase 6 VERIFY (Evidence Gate)

Run command → Read complete output → Confirm match → THEN claim. No "should work", no trusting prior runs. **Red flags:** "probably passes", "seems fine", about to commit without fresh test run, trusting cached output.

**Cross-service live-smoke evidence (added session 59 cycle B).** When the cycle touches **≥2 services**, unit suite green is insufficient — mock-only coverage repeatedly hid cross-service contract bugs (4 hits sessions 58-59: K21 `execute_tool` timeout, embedding model-ref UUID drift, eval/ docker shipping, chat-service `/record` 401). At VERIFY completion the evidence string MUST include ONE of these tokens, or `workflow-gate.py` emits a soft warning (never blocks):

- `live smoke: <one-liner>` — confirm a real cross-service call ran on a stack-up (the bug surface)
- `LIVE-SMOKE deferred to D-<NAME>-LIVE-SMOKE` — track the deferral row in SESSION_HANDOFF
- `live infra unavailable: <reason>` — legitimate skip when full stack isn't bootable at dev time

`workflow-gate.py` autodetects cross-service via `git diff --name-only HEAD` matching ≥2 distinct `services/<name>/` prefixes. The warning is advisory; the agent decides whether to live-smoke now or defer it explicitly.

**"CI is green" means every workflow's LATEST run, not the runs on your commit (2026-08-09).** Several workflows are **path-filtered** (`domain-db-smoke` → 4 `services/**` trees; `python-integration-tests` → its six Python services). A commit outside those paths does not trigger them, so `gh run list --limit N` returns only what ran and a red workflow **silently drops off the list**. A path-filtered workflow that did not run is **UNKNOWN, not passing** — and its last real answer may be months old.

This was measured, not theorised: main was reported "all 7 workflows green" on 2026-08-08 while `domain-db-smoke` had been red since 2026-08-05 and `python-integration-tests` since 2026-08-08. Both were invisible because that day's commits touched `frontend/`, `scripts/`, `docs/` and `tests/`. Between them they were hiding a read path that silently undid a user's write, and entities whose names were stored correctly but unfindable downstream.

So before claiming the repo is green, compare the **defined** workflows against the ones that ran, and check the last run of each that is missing:

```bash
ls .github/workflows/*.yml | sed 's#.*/##'                 # what EXISTS
gh run list --limit 40 --json name,headSha \
  --jq ".[] | select(.headSha==\"$(git rev-parse HEAD)\") | .name" | sort -u   # what RAN
gh run list --workflow=<missing>.yml --limit 1 --json conclusion,headSha,createdAt
```

Ignore only the ones with no `push` trigger (`workflow_dispatch` / `schedule` / deploy). Anything push-triggered that did not run needs its last conclusion read out loud before the word "green" is used.

### Phase 7 REVIEW (2-Stage Code Review)

| Stage | Focus |
|-------|-------|
| 1. Spec compliance | Does code implement what was designed? Missing requirements? Scope creep? |
| 2. Code quality | Patterns, security, a11y, performance, maintainability |

Both stages must pass. Issues found → fix → re-VERIFY → re-review.

### Phase 9 POST-REVIEW (Human-Interactive Checkpoint) — NEVER skippable

**Why:** forcing-function pause so the human can veto / redirect / request specifics before SESSION+COMMIT burns the diff in. Deep self-review here doesn't work (author blindness → "0 issues found" rubber-stamp).

**Default mode:** present concise summary (files touched, design decisions, verify evidence), **STOP and WAIT** for human reply. Don't pre-write "0 issues found" — that's the rubber-stamp tell. Human approves → SESSION. Human asks deeper → invoke `/review-impl` first.

**Proactively suggest `/review-impl` (without being asked) when:** auth/credential code, tenant isolation boundaries, destructive ops, injection defenses, new service boundaries, or anything user previously flagged as load-bearing.


**Completion evidence:** `"summary presented, human approved: <one-liner>"`. If `/review-impl` ran, fold its findings into the evidence.

### Phases 10 + 11 + 12 — mandatory, do not forget

After QC succeeds, **do not** declare task done. Three more phases:

1. **SESSION (10)** — update `docs/sessions/SESSION_HANDOFF.md` (or `docs/03_planning/<TRACK>/SESSION_HANDOFF.md` for design tracks): overwrite the **▶ NEXT SESSION** block — header (date, HEAD), NEXT items, Deferred list. Move cleared deferrals to "Recently cleared".
2. **COMMIT (11)** — stage only changed files (no `git add -A`); commit message names phase + review fixes + test count; SESSION update lands in the same commit as the code.
3. **RETRO (12)** — non-obvious decisions or workarounds get written **into the repo**, where the
   next session will actually hit them: amend the standard/spec the lesson belongs to, or add a note
   to `docs/sessions/SESSION_HANDOFF.md`. If the lesson is a *rule*, it belongs in
   `docs/standards/` with a mechanism, not in prose — see the deferral-mechanism rule above.
   Skip if nothing notable.

**Hard rule:** work not recorded in SESSION_HANDOFF and committed to git **does not exist** for the next session.

### Debugging Protocol

NO FIXES WITHOUT ROOT CAUSE.

```
1. INVEST  — Read errors fully, reproduce, trace data flow backward
2. PATTERN — Find working examples, compare every difference
3. HYPOTHE — State hypothesis, test one variable at a time
4. FIX     — Write failing test → implement single fix → verify
```

**Hard stop:** 3+ fix attempts fail → stop, question architecture, discuss with user.

### Slash commands

| Command | When |
|---|---|
| `/review-impl [task-id] [+check]` | On-demand deep adversarial review — the standards gate plus the coverage pass. Invoke when POST-REVIEW needs a deeper look, or after COMMIT when something feels off. Add **`+check`** to validate the findings through a fresh-context subagent before they are shown: it can drop a fabricated finding, correct a wrong citation, or promote one that was under-rated. It fails open and says so — a validator that dies never silently shrinks a review, and it may never drop a HIGH finding tagged with an ENFORCED/LOCKED standard. |

**Retired 2026-08-03: `/loom`, `/raid`, `/warp`, `/amaw`.** `/review-impl` is the only runner left, and
it is the only one that was still being used. AI Factory's `aif-plan` (818 lines) + `aif-implement`
(987) + `aif-verify` (556), its `implement-coordinator`/`implement-worker` pair with real worktree
isolation, and its read-only sidecars cover what the four did, at roughly fifty times the detail and
maintained upstream.

**The 12-phase gate is NOT retired.** `scripts/workflow-gate.py` and the pre-commit hook are the
mechanical part, they are independent of the runners, and they stay.

Two things were deliberately kept rather than deleted, and the reason is the same in both cases —
**deleting them would turn dozens of `docs/**` references into lies**, which is the rot this repo
spends its gates preventing:

- **`scripts/raid/` and `scripts/warp/`** are not runner plumbing. They are live-smoke and
  slice-validation scripts that production tests cite by path (`verify-cycle-5.sh`,
  `verify-cycle-13.sh`), that `scripts/capacity-thresholds.yaml` points at, and that
  `gate-wiring-gate.py` carries an exemption for. Each has 4–7 references from outside its own
  directory. The `slices` gate verb stays with them.
- **`docs/audit/AUDIT_LOG.jsonl`** is committed history. The writer is gone; the record is not.

See [`docs/plans/2026-08-03-retire-unused-workflow-runners.md`](docs/plans/2026-08-03-retire-unused-workflow-runners.md)
for what was measured and where the plan's original scope turned out to be wrong.

## Module Progression

Modules are implemented in order. Each module has a full doc set in `docs/03_planning/`:
- Execution pack, API contract, frontend flow spec, backend/frontend detailed design
- UI/UX wireframe spec, integration sequence diagrams, acceptance test plan
- Implementation readiness gate, governance review checklist

Read only the docs for the module you're actively working on.

## Project Constants
```
project_id:      loreweave
frontend:        :5174 = the BAKED nginx prod build (rebuild the image for FE changes; a host `vite dev` can SHADOW it). Robust FE smoke = built image on a free port, or `vite dev` :5199. FE talks to the gateway via RELATIVE /v1.
gateway:         api-gateway-bff (NestJS BFF) — container :3000, host-mapped :3123 (dev). vite proxy → :3123 (dev); nginx → gateway:3000 (prod). No :3001 (stale).
(no MCP memory service — see "Agent memory" above; :3000 host port is free since 2026-08-03)

## Test Account — lives in your PERSONAL, UNTRACKED dev-environment file

Smoke tests (browser + real-LLM) run against a seeded local account. **Those values are
per-developer and per-machine** — the `auth id` is a UUID from *your* local
`loreweave_auth`, the BYOK `user_models` are rows in *your* local
`loreweave_provider_registry`. Pinning them in a tracked file sends the next contributor
to someone else's row (the same failure mode documented for `user_model_id` below).

So the account lives in **`docs/dev/LOCAL_TEST_ENV.md`** — **git-ignored, one per developer**.

- **First time here:** copy [`docs/dev/LOCAL_TEST_ENV.example.md`](docs/dev/LOCAL_TEST_ENV.example.md)
  to `docs/dev/LOCAL_TEST_ENV.md` and fill it in. The example file documents how to seed the
  account and where each value comes from.
- **Agents:** read `docs/dev/LOCAL_TEST_ENV.md` when a task needs a live login. If it is absent,
  say so and ask — **do not invent credentials and do not fall back to values found in old
  `docs/plans/**` or `docs/sessions/**` files** (those are historical records of one machine).
- **Test code reads env vars, never a hardcoded literal** — Playwright resolves
  `PLAYWRIGHT_TEST_EMAIL` / `PLAYWRIGHT_TEST_PASSWORD` (see
  [`frontend/tests/e2e/helpers/auth.ts`](frontend/tests/e2e/helpers/auth.ts)). Export them from
  your local file; the in-code defaults are a dev-seed convenience, not a shared secret.

**This account is a LOCAL DEV SEED. It must never exist on a deployed instance, and no
production or personal credential ever goes in a tracked file.**

### 🔒 Which model do I test with? — `scripts/dev-model.py`. Do not ask.

```bash
python scripts/dev-model.py chat        # -> the user_model_id for this stack
python scripts/dev-model.py --env       # exportable lines for every role + the internal token
python scripts/dev-model.py --list      # everything available, and what it would pick
```

**Never hardcode a `user_model_id`, and never ask which model to use.** This block
exists because *"prefer a local one"* plus a list of five is not a default, it is
a question — and it was answered by hand session after session. A first attempt at
fixing it pinned the UUIDs here, which is **worse**: `user_model_id`s are
**per-machine**, so a hardcoded table sends the next developer to a 404 or to
someone else's row.

The resolver asks for a **role** and reads preference off data the user already
expressed — capability flag, then `is_favorite`, then the `sort_order` they
arranged in the UI. On a stack with the standing setup that resolves chat to
**Gemma-4 26B-A4B QAT**, without anyone being told so.

**It refuses to return a billed model unless you pass `--allow-paid`**, decided by
`provider_kind` (`lm_studio`/`ollama`/… are local and free; anything unrecognised
is treated as billed, which is the safe direction). If lm_studio is down it says
so and stops, rather than silently spending on `gpt-4o` to paper over an outage.

Caveat that bites: `user_default_models` is **empty** for this account, so anything
resolving *"the default model for capability X"* gets nothing — **always pass an
explicit `model_ref`**.
