# Syncular agent instructions

Local-first sync engine: local SQLite is the read model, writes go through an
outbox, servers converge clients. One TS core and one Rust core implement the
same wire protocol, **conformance-locked** against each other. Docs site:
syncular.dev (built from `apps/docs`, tracks main).

This file is the canonical instruction set for coding agents and applies to
human contributors just as much. `CLAUDE.md` is a gitignored symlink to this
file, created by the root `postinstall` script.

Read before non-trivial work: `docs/SPEC.md` (wire truth), `docs/SYQL.md`
(query-language truth), the relevant package README, and `docs/RELEASE.md`
when changing release behavior. Do not revive removed mechanisms or add a
parallel path without current evidence and a specification change.

## Doctrine (enforced)

- **Spec-first**: wire-behavior changes start in SPEC.md; judgment calls get
  codified back into it.
- **No fallback paths.** Loud, precise errors over silent degradation.
- **No timers in tests.** Deterministic flush/readiness helpers only
  (`flushQuerySchedulers`, chained microtasks); a wall-clock sleep is a bug.
- **Cross-core parity**: behavior observable on the wire or through the
  client surface must match TS and Rust. Semantics changes (e.g. window
  completeness, invalidation granularity) require BOTH cores plus a
  conformance catalog scenario (`packages/conformance/src/catalog/`); a
  TS-only change breaks the rust-conformance CI pairing.
- Commit/push: local commits after verification are fine; **push only on
  the maintainer's explicit instruction**.

## Coding rules

- **No unnecessary code artifacts.** Direct code only: no named helpers,
  wrappers, constants, or files for single-use logic. Inline it unless it is
  reused, explicitly requested, or shared between production code and tests.
- **Less is more.** Rewrite an existing component before adding a parallel
  one. Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones.
- **Bugfix restraint.** For bug fixes, first check whether existing code can
  be simplified, reduced, or localized; add new arguments, plumbing, or
  abstractions only when the root cause shows they are necessary. Tests can
  grow freely.
- **Scan for repeats.** After finding a bug, `rg` for the same pattern
  elsewhere in the repo before fixing a single instance.
- **Clean codebase.** Flag obsolete files for removal.
- **Stable error identities.** Errors carry static codes
  (`sync.outbox_incompatible` style); dynamic values (ids, cursors, raw rows)
  belong in structured error details, never interpolated into the message.
- **No `as any` / `as unknown`.** When something fails to typecheck, fix the
  underlying type.
- **Testable change → test.** Add or extend a `bun:test` file next to the
  change. No `mock.module`; use dependency injection or scoped test doubles.
- **Docs and changelog ship with the feature.** A change that alters what
  users see or do updates the docs site (`apps/docs/src/content/*.md`);
  feature-level work also adds an entry to the changelog manifest
  (`apps/docs/src/changelog.mjs`, newest first, linking to the docs page
  that covers it).
- **English everywhere**: code, comments, commit messages, docs.
- **Commits are human.** No AI attributions, `Co-Authored-By` trailers, or
  tool names in commit messages.
- **Leave others' work alone.** Never run destructive git commands
  (`revert`, `reset --hard`, forced checkouts) over changes you did not make.
- **No unrequested publishing.** Deploy, release, and publish scripts run only
  on explicit instruction, like pushes.

## Prose rules for docs

Reader-facing text gets the same review as code.

### Voice

Write as the engineer who built the system, addressing a peer who will
build on it. The register is a good reference manual: declarative,
concrete, unhurried. Every sentence carries a fact, an instruction, or a
consequence; a sentence that carries none is deleted. When something is
uncertain or unmeasured, say so plainly or leave it out.

### Sentence mechanics

- Actor first, active verb: "The server validates whole commits", never
  "Commits are validated". Passive voice only when the actor is unknown
  or irrelevant.
- Name the component doing the work (`typegen`, the outbox, the client
  core). "The system", "the solution", and "functionality" are banned
  subjects.
- One canonical name per concept, reused verbatim across the page.
  Repeating a technical noun is correct; rotating synonyms makes readers
  hunt for a distinction that does not exist.
- Numbers and names over adjectives: "bootstraps 100k rows in 30.7 ms
  warm", never "fast bootstrap". A claim needs a number, a spec section,
  or a code path behind it; otherwise cut it.
- Instructions in the imperative, consequence stated as fact: "Use a
  persistent database path. An in-memory database loses the outbox on
  restart."
- Define a term at first use or link to the page that does.
- Bullets only for genuinely parallel items (options, fields, steps).
  Connected reasoning stays in paragraphs.

### Banned patterns (generated-prose tells; delete on sight)

- **No em-dashes.** Use a colon, semicolon, comma, parentheses, or a
  sentence split. List items are "`thing`: description".
- **No rhetorical antithesis.** "X, not Y" and "not X, but Y" become a plain
  statement of the positive fact.
- **No punchlines or aphorisms.** A sentence that restates the previous one
  as a slogan ("That is the whole point", "This is the spine of the system")
  gets deleted.
- **No empty framing.** "The key insight", "It's worth noting", "Crucially",
  "Simply put", and any sentence whose only job is to announce that the next
  one matters.
- **No marketing adjectives.** robust, elegant, seamless, powerful,
  battle-tested, blazing, production-scale. State the measurable property
  instead.
- **No rhetorical questions** answered by the next sentence.
- **No hedging.** "can potentially", "may be able to", "it is possible
  that". Commit to the fact or delete the sentence.
- **No decorative triads.** Three adjectives or three parallel clauses
  used for rhythm. Enumerate real items; the count falls where it falls.
- **No "simply", "just", "easily", "straightforward".** If true, the word
  is unnecessary; if false, it insults the stuck reader.
- **No enthusiasm.** Exclamation marks, "Let's", "dive in". The reader is
  working.
- **No analogies.** Explain the mechanism itself; "think of X as Y" trades
  precision away.
- **No summary paragraphs and no heading echo.** The page ends when the
  content ends, and the first sentence under a heading advances past the
  heading instead of restating it.

### The test

Reread the paragraph and delete everything whose removal loses no fact,
instruction, or consequence. Then check the survivors against the tells.

## Layout

- `packages/*` (TS): `core`, `crypto`, `server`, `server-hono`,
  `server-workers`, `web-client` (npm: `@syncular/client`), `react`,
  `typegen` (bin: `syncular`), `tauri` (JS bridge), `crdt-yjs`, `testing`
  (npm: `@syncular/testkit`), `create-app`, `conformance` (private).
- `rust/` is its own cargo workspace: `ssp2`, `client`, `command`, `ffi`
  (C-ABI `libsyncular`), `syncular` (stub crate).
- `bindings/`: `tauri/` (plugin + example; **separate cargo workspace**,
  deliberately outside the main cargo gate), `kotlin/` (Gradle, FFM/JDK21+),
  `flutter/`, `react-native/` (bun workspace member), `swift/` (local-only
  gate, needs macOS). Each has its own `check.sh`.
- `apps/docs`, `apps/demo*`, `examples/quickstart`, `bench/`, `load/`.

## Dev loop

```sh
bun install
bun run check        # typecheck + oxlint/oxfmt + knip + tests. THE gate (pre-push hook runs it)
```

- Tests are split: `test:main` plus an isolated multi-tab lane (documented
  bun worker+sqlite segfault, see the root package.json note; retry once is
  expected, do not "fix" it).
- Rust: `cargo test` / `clippy -D warnings` in `rust/`; the tauri plugin
  builds in `bindings/tauri/` separately.
- Lint/format: oxlint (`.oxlintrc.json`) + oxfmt (`.oxfmtrc.json`); knip
  guards unused files/deps/exports (`knip.json`). `bun run lint:fix` before
  committing; generated files (`*.generated.ts`, `*.queries.ts`) are excluded
  from all three.
- React package tests: bun:test + RTL over happy-dom (`--preload
  ./test/setup.ts`), `FakeClient` for hook semantics, `loopback.ts` +
  `handle-shape.ts` for the promise-path parity lane. Typegen has golden
  tests (`test/fixtures/`; the `basic` fixture covers all six column types).

### The repo is dist-free (this bites)

`packages/*/dist` is gitignored and only exists after `bun run
build:packages`. Published exports point `browser`/`import` at `dist/`, but
the **`bun` condition points at `src/*.ts`**, so everything in-repo resolves
through it. Consequences:

- Any tsconfig typechecking against `@syncular/*` inside the repo needs
  `"customConditions": ["bun"]` (see `bindings/react-native/tsconfig.json`).
- Bun.build sites pin `conditions: ['bun']`.
- When hot-patching an installed copy in a CONSUMER app: Vite serves whatever
  the `browser` condition points at, so patch that file, and never delete
  `node_modules/.vite` under a running dev server (it serves a mixed bundle;
  restart instead).

## CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)

Jobs are **path-gated**: binding gates (tauri, swift-kotlin+RN, flutter) only
do real work when `bindings/` or the FFI core (`rust/`) changed. So touching
the Rust core arms all of them, and latent failures surface on YOUR commit.
Known environmental requirements already encoded (don't regress them):

- kotlin: `junit-platform-launcher` as `testRuntimeOnly` (wrapper-less
  setup-gradle provisions Gradle 9, which stopped injecting it).
- tauri: `example/dist` must exist before anything compiles the example,
  because `tauri::generate_context!` hard-fails on a missing `frontendDist`.
- flutter: `dart analyze` is fatal on ANALYZER diagnostics too
  (`unused_element` etc. are not covered by the generated-file `type=lint`
  ignore; the dart emitter emits row helpers conditionally for this reason).

## Releases

Trusted publishing, no local tokens: **bump every version in lockstep**
(14 `packages/*/package.json` + 5 `rust/crates/*/Cargo.toml` + the plugin,
including the path-dep `version =` constraints), refresh lockfiles
(`bun install`, `cargo check` in `rust/` AND `bindings/tauri/`), `bun run
check`, commit, tag `v<version>`, push the tag → `release.yml` publishes npm
(OIDC + provenance) and crates.io (dependency order: ssp2 → client → command
→ ffi → syncular → tauri-plugin-syncular). Both publish jobs **skip
already-published versions**, so a partial-failure re-run (or a validation
`workflow_dispatch`) publishes exactly what's missing. The crates job
installs Tauri's GTK/WebKit apt deps for the plugin's verify build. Runbook:
`docs/RELEASE.md`. The docs banner reads the released version off
`packages/core` at build time.

## Contributions

External PRs are held to the same doctrine as maintainer work. LLM assistance
is welcome for tests, reproductions, benchmarks, tooling, docs, and production
code. If a model drafted or rewrote code or prose that is still in an external
pull request, mention that in the pull request description; routine completion
and spelling help do not need a note. Review, understand, and iterate on
everything you submit; you must be able to defend every line. Production code
gets the strictest review. Low-effort machine-generated PRs, issues, and
comments are closed without comment. The reader-facing version of this policy
lives in `README.md`, `apps/docs/src/content/contributing.md`, and
`apps/docs/src/content/llms.md`; keep them in agreement.
