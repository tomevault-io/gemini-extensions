```

### Core Principles

1. **Event Sourcing** — Game state is never mutated directly. All changes are appended as `HistoryEntry` objects to `game.history`. Each entry contains an immutable `stateAfter` snapshot.

2. **Modularity through Pipelines** — Roles and effects do not reference each other's logic. Interactions happen through the **Intent Pipeline**: roles emit intents ("I want to kill this player"), and effects register handlers to intercept/modify/prevent them.

3. **Perception over Identity** — Information roles never check a player's actual role directly. They use the **Perception System** (`perceive()`), which allows effects to modify how a player is perceived (e.g., Recluse registering as evil).

4. **Effects carry behavior** — Roles are thin. Passive abilities live on **Effects** (attached to players at game start via `initialEffects`). Effects declare intent handlers, day actions, win conditions, and perception modifiers.

5. **No hardcoded role logic in the game controller** — `game.ts` knows nothing about individual roles. It orchestrates the game loop generically.

---

## 2. Event-Sourced Game State

**File:** `src/lib/types.ts`

### Core Types

```typescript
type Game = {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    createdAt: number;
    history: HistoryEntry[];    // The entire game state is here
};

type HistoryEntry = {
    id: string;
    timestamp: number;
    type: EventType;
    message: RichMessage;           // i18n-ready display messages
    data: Record<string, unknown>;  // Structured event data
    stateAfter: GameState;          // Full state snapshot after this event
};

type GameState = {
    phase: Phase;                   // "setup" | "night" | "day" | "voting" | "ended"
    round: number;                  // 0 = setup, 1+ = game rounds
    players: PlayerState[];
    winner: Team | null;
};

type PlayerState = {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    roleId: string;
    effects: EffectInstance[];      // All active effects on this player
};

type EffectInstance = {
    id: string;
    type: string;                   // References an EffectId
    data?: Record<string, unknown>; // Instance-specific data
    sourcePlayerId?: string;
    expiresAt?: "end_of_night" | "end_of_day" | "never";
};
```

### How State Evolves

The `Game` object is immutable. Every change creates a new `Game` by appending a `HistoryEntry`:

```typescript
game = addHistoryEntry(
    game,
    { type: "night_action", message: [...], data: {...} },  // entry
    { phase: "day" },                                        // state updates
    { [playerId]: [{ type: "safe", expiresAt: "end_of_night" }] },  // add effects
    { [playerId]: ["pure"] }                                 // remove effects
);
```

`getCurrentState(game)` returns `game.history.at(-1).stateAfter`.

### Event Types

The `EventType` enum tracks all possible history events: `game_created`, `night_started`, `role_revealed`, `night_action`, `night_skipped`, `night_resolved`, `day_started`, `nomination`, `vote`, `execution`, `virgin_execution`, `virgin_spent`, `slayer_shot`, `effect_added`, `effect_removed`, `setup_action`, `role_change_revealed`, `game_ended`.

### Rich Messages

Messages use `RichMessage` (array of `MessagePart`), which support i18n keys, player references, role references, and effect references. The `RichMessage` component renders these parts with proper formatting.

---

## 3. The Game Controller

**File:** `src/lib/game.ts`

The game controller provides pure functions that take a `Game` and return a new `Game`. It has **zero knowledge of individual roles** — all role-specific behavior lives in role definitions and effects.

### Key Functions

| Function | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `createGame(name, players)` | Creates a game, applies `initialEffects` from roles |
| `getNextStep(game)` | Returns the next `GameStep` (role reveal, night action, day, etc.) |
| `startNight(game)` | Transitions to night phase, increments round |
| `startDay(game)` | Resolves night, announces deaths, expires effects, transitions to day |
| `applyNightAction(game, result)` | Applies direct history entries and effects from a role's night action |
| `nominate(game, nominatorId, nomineeId)` | Sends nomination through the Intent Pipeline |
| `resolveVote(game, nomineeId, votesFor, votesAgainst)` | Processes vote, executes if majority |
| `checkWinCondition(state, game)` | Checks core + dynamic win conditions |
| `checkEndOfDayWinConditions(state, game)` | Checks "end_of_day" trigger win conditions |
| `endGame(game, winner)` | Ends game with a winner |
| `applySetupAction(game, playerId, result)` | Applies a pre-revelation setup action (e.g., Drunk's role change) |
| `addEffectToPlayer(game, playerId, effectType)` | Narrator manually adds an effect |
| `removeEffectFromPlayer(game, playerId, effectType)` | Narrator manually removes an effect |

### Night Action Flow

The night action flow is critical. When `applyNightAction()` is called:

1. **Direct changes** (entries, stateUpdates, addEffects, removeEffects) are applied immediately via `addHistoryEntry()`.
2. **The intent** (if present in `NightActionResult.intent`) is **NOT** processed here — it's handled separately by `GameScreen.tsx` via `resolveIntent()`.

This separation exists because the pipeline may return `needs_input` (requiring UI), which the game controller can't handle — only the React component can.

### Night Role Status

`getNightRolesStatus(game)` returns a list of `NightRoleStatus` entries for the current night, indicating which roles need to act and whether they've already done so:

```typescript
type NightRoleStatus = {
    roleId: string;
    playerId: string;
    playerName: string;
    status: "pending" | "done";
};
```

Only roles whose `shouldWake()` returns `true` (or is undefined) and who have a `nightOrder` appear in this list. Roles that don't need to wake are excluded entirely.

### Game Step Resolution

`getNextStep()` determines what happens next:

- In **night**: finds the next role (by `nightOrder`) that hasn't acted
- In **day**: returns `{ type: "day" }`
- Always checks `checkWinCondition()` first

---

## 4. Roles

**Files:** `src/lib/roles/types.ts`, `src/lib/roles/index.ts`, `src/lib/roles/definition/**`

### RoleDefinition

```typescript
type RoleDefinition = {
    id: RoleId;
    team: TeamId;                           // "townsfolk" | "outsider" | "minion" | "demon"
    icon: IconName;
    nightOrder: number | null;              // Lower = wakes earlier. null = doesn't wake
    shouldWake?: (game, player) => boolean; // Conditional waking
    initialEffects?: EffectToAdd[];         // Effects added at game creation
    winConditions?: WinConditionCheck[];    // Dynamic win conditions
    nightSteps?: NightStepDefinition[];     // Declarative night action step list (see §4a)
    RoleReveal: FC<RoleRevealProps>;        // Component shown when player learns their role
    NightAction: FC<NightActionProps> | null; // Night action component (null = no action)
    SetupAction?: FC<SetupActionProps>;     // Pre-revelation narrator setup (see §4b)
};
```

### Night Action Result

When a role's `NightAction` component calls `onComplete()`, it provides:

```typescript
type NightActionResult = {
    entries: Omit<HistoryEntry, "id" | "timestamp" | "stateAfter">[];  // History log
    stateUpdates?: Partial<GameState>;
    addEffects?: Record<string, EffectToAdd[]>;     // playerId -> effects to add
    removeEffects?: Record<string, string[]>;       // playerId -> effect types to remove
    intent?: Intent;                                // Optional intent for the pipeline
};
```

**Key:** `entries`, `stateUpdates`, `addEffects`, and `removeEffects` are applied **directly** (they are the role's own bookkeeping). The `intent` is sent through the **pipeline** for other effects to intercept.

### Role Categories

| Category | Example Roles | Pattern |
|----------|---------------|---------|
| **Action Roles** | Imp, Monk, Poisoner | Emit an intent or apply direct effects at night |
| **Info Roles (auto-calc)** | Chef, Empath | Calculate information using `perceive()`, display result |
| **Info Roles (narrator-setup)** | Washerwoman, Librarian, Investigator | Narrator selects players/roles to show, uses `perceive()` for highlighting and role display |
| **Info Roles (death-triggered)** | Ravenkeeper, Undertaker | Wake conditionally, show role using `perceive()` |
| **Passive Roles** | Virgin, Slayer, Mayor, Soldier, Saint | `NightAction: null`, behavior via `initialEffects` |

### Night Action Steps (NightStepListLayout)

**Files:** `src/lib/roles/types.ts` (type), `src/components/layouts/NightStepListLayout.tsx` (component)

Every role with a `NightAction` begins with a **step list landing page** before entering the actual action flow. This provides the narrator with a predictable, consistent UI: they always see what steps are coming before any player-facing screens appear.

#### How It Works

```
NightDashboard → taps role → NightAction component
                               │
                               ▼
                          NightStepListLayout (landing page)
                               │ taps next step
                               ▼
                          Step 1: e.g. PerceptionConfigStep
                               │ done → back to step list
                               ▼
                          Step 2: e.g. Show Result (calls onComplete)
```

The step list is **inside** each `NightAction` component — no new screen types in `GameScreen.tsx`. Each role manages its own step navigation via internal `useState` with a `phase` variable.

#### NightStepDefinition

Roles declare their steps via the optional `nightSteps` field on `RoleDefinition`:

```typescript
type NightStepDefinition = {
    id: string;
    icon: IconName;
    getLabel: (t: Translations) => string;
    condition?: (game: Game, player: PlayerState, state: GameState) => boolean;
};
```

- `condition` makes steps **dynamic** — they only appear when the condition is true (e.g., "Configure Perceptions" only shows when ambiguous players exist).
- If `nightSteps` is omitted, the role still works — it simply manages its own internal flow.

#### NightStepListLayout Component

The shared layout component renders the step list with:
- Role header (icon, name, player name)
- Numbered step rows with status badges (pending / done / next)
- Only the next pending step is tappable (consistent with Night Dashboard pattern)
- `isEvil` prop switches between indigo (good) and red (evil) theming

```typescript
type NightStep = {
    id: string;
    icon: IconName;
    label: string;
    status: "pending" | "done" | "active";
};

// Props
type Props = {
    icon: IconName;
    roleName: string;
    playerName: string;
    isEvil?: boolean;
    steps: NightStep[];
    onSelectStep: (stepId: string) => void;
};
```

#### How Roles Build Steps at Runtime

The `NightAction` component reads its role's `nightSteps` (or hardcodes a step array) and combines static metadata with runtime status tracking:

```typescript
const steps: NightStep[] = useMemo(() => {
    const result: NightStep[] = [];

    // Conditional step — only appears when ambiguous players exist
    if (needsPerceptionConfig) {
        result.push({
            id: "configure_perceptions",
            icon: "eye",
            label: t.game.stepConfigurePerceptions,
            status: perceptionConfigDone ? "done" : "pending",
        });
    }

    // Always-present step
    result.push({
        id: "show_result",
        icon: "chefHat",
        label: t.game.stepShowResult,
        status: "pending",
    });

    return result;
}, [needsPerceptionConfig, perceptionConfigDone, t]);
```

#### Current Role Step Configurations

| Role | Steps | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| **Chef** | (1) Configure Perceptions (cond.), (2) Show Result | Perception config when ambiguous alignment players exist |
| **Empath** | (1) Configure Perceptions (cond.), (2) Show Result | Scoped to alive neighbors only |
| **Undertaker** | (1) Configure Perceptions (cond.), (2) Show Role | Scoped to the executed player |
| **Fortune Teller** | (1) Assign Red Herring (cond.), (2) Select players, (3) Configure Malfunction (cond.), (4) Show Result | Red Herring step only on night 1 |
| **Ravenkeeper** | (1) Select Player, (2) Configure Perceptions (cond.), (3) Show Role | Perception step appears dynamically after player selection |
| **Washerwoman** | (1) Narrator Setup | Single step (misregistration handled inline) |
| **Librarian** | (1) Narrator Setup | Single step |
| **Investigator** | (1) Narrator Setup | Single step |
| **Imp** | (1) Choose Victim | Single step, evil theming |
| **Monk** | (1) Choose Player | Single step |
| **Poisoner** | (1) Choose Target | Single step, evil theming. Applies `poisoned` effect to target |

When a role is malfunctioning (has `poisoned` or `drunk` effect), an additional **Configure Malfunction** step is conditionally inserted before the result step. The narrator uses `MalfunctionConfigStep` to provide false results. See [§5a: The Malfunction System](#the-malfunction-system).

### Setup Actions (Pre-Revelation)

**Files:** `src/lib/roles/types.ts` (types), `src/components/screens/SetupActionsScreen.tsx` (UI)

Some roles require narrator configuration **before** role revelation begins. These roles declare a `SetupAction` component on their `RoleDefinition`.

#### SetupAction Types

```typescript
type SetupActionProps = {
    player: PlayerState;
    state: GameState;
    onComplete: (result: SetupActionResult) => void;
};

type SetupActionResult = {
    changeRole?: string;             // Change the player's roleId
    addEffects?: Record<string, EffectToAdd[]>;
    removeEffects?: Record<string, string[]>;
};
```

#### How Setup Actions Work

```
createGame() → Setup Actions Screen → Role Revelation Screen → Night 1
                    │
                    ├── For each player with role.SetupAction:
                    │     Narrator sees setup UI → onComplete(result)
                    │     applySetupAction(game, playerId, result)
                    │
                    └── When all done → Continue to Role Revelation
```

The `SetupActionsScreen` displays a list of pending setup actions. The narrator processes each one sequentially. Each result is applied via `applySetupAction()` in `game.ts`, which creates a `setup_action` history entry and applies role changes + effects.

#### Current Setup Actions

| Role | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Drunk** | Narrator chooses which Townsfolk role the Drunk believes they are. Changes `roleId` to that role and applies permanent `drunk` effect. |

### Registering a New Role

1. Create file in `src/lib/roles/definition/` (or `definition/trouble-brewing/` for that script)
2. Add `RoleId` to the union type in `src/lib/roles/types.ts`
3. Import and register in `src/lib/roles/index.ts` (both `ROLES` and the relevant `SCRIPTS` entry)
4. Add translations in `src/lib/i18n/translations/en.ts` and `es.ts`

---

## 5. Effects

**Files:** `src/lib/effects/types.ts`, `src/lib/effects/index.ts`, `src/lib/effects/definition/*`

Effects are the primary mechanism for modular game behavior. They attach to players and can:
- Modify player state (dead, can't vote, can't nominate)
- Intercept game intents (prevent kills, redirect kills, prevent nominations)
- Register day actions (Slayer shot)
- Register night follow-ups (reactive night actions, e.g., role change reveals)
- Register win conditions (Saint/Martyrdom, Mayor peaceful victory)
- Modify perception (how info roles see the player)

### EffectDefinition

```typescript
type EffectDefinition = {
    id: EffectId;
    icon: IconName;

    // Behavior modifiers (simple boolean flags)
    preventsNightWake?: boolean;
    preventsVoting?: boolean;
    preventsNomination?: boolean;

    // Malfunction flag — when true, the player's ability malfunctions
    // (info roles give wrong info, action roles' effects don't apply,
    // passive handlers are skipped, win conditions are disabled)
    poisonsAbility?: boolean;

    // Conditional behavior
    canVote?: (player, state) => boolean;
    canNominate?: (player, state) => boolean;

    // Pipeline integration
    handlers?: IntentHandler[];             // Intercept/modify intents
    dayActions?: DayActionDefinition[];     // Register day-phase abilities
    nightFollowUps?: NightFollowUpDefinition[];  // Register reactive night-phase actions
    winConditions?: WinConditionCheck[];    // Register custom win conditions
    perceptionModifiers?: PerceptionModifier[];  // Alter perceived identity

    // Misregistration declaration — used by perception query utilities
    // (getAmbiguousPlayers, canRegisterAsTeam, canRegisterAsAlignment)
    // to detect players needing narrator perception configuration
    canRegisterAs?: {
        teams?: TeamId[];
        alignments?: ("good" | "evil")[];
    };
};
```

### Current Effects

| Effect | Applied By | Purpose | Pipeline Features |
|--------|-----------|---------|-------------------|
| `dead` | Pipeline/game | Player is dead | `preventsNightWake`, conditional voting |
| `used_dead_vote` | game.ts | Dead player used their one vote | `preventsVoting` |
| `safe` | Soldier (permanent), Monk (nightly) | Protection from death | `handlers`: prevents kill intents |
| `red_herring` | Fortune Teller | False positive for FT checks | No handlers (checked directly by FT) |
| `pure` | Virgin | Townsfolk nominators get executed | `handlers`: intercepts nominations |
| `slayer_bullet` | Slayer | One-shot day kill | `dayActions`: SlayerActionScreen |
| `bounce` | Mayor | Redirects kills to another player | `handlers`: requests UI, redirects kill |
| `martyrdom` | Saint | Evil wins if executed | `winConditions`: after_execution |
| `scarlet_woman` | Scarlet Woman | Becomes Demon when Demon dies | `handlers`: piggybacks role change + `pending_role_reveal` |
| `recluse_misregister` | Recluse | Outsider that may register as evil | `perceptionModifiers`, `canRegisterAs: { teams: [minion, demon], alignments: [evil] }` |
| `pending_role_reveal` | Scarlet Woman handler (or any role-changing effect) | Signals a role change needs to be revealed | `nightFollowUps`: shows RoleCard to narrator |
| `poisoned` | Poisoner (nightly) | Ability malfunction, expires at end of day (lasts night + day) | `poisonsAbility: true` — flag only, detected by `isMalfunctioning()` |
| `drunk` | Drunk (permanent, via SetupAction) | Permanent malfunction + unconditional Drunk/Outsider perception | `poisonsAbility: true`, `perceptionModifiers`: always shows as Drunk/Outsider |

### Effect Lifecycle

- **Creation**: Added via `initialEffects` on role definition, or via `addEffects` in night action results / pipeline state changes
- **Expiration**: Effects can expire at `"end_of_night"`, `"end_of_day"`, or `"never"`. Expiration is handled by `expireEffects()` in `game.ts` during phase transitions.
- **Manual management**: The narrator can add/remove effects via the Grimoire UI (`EditEffectsModal`)

### Registering a New Effect

1. Create file in `src/lib/effects/definition/`
2. Add `EffectId` to the union type in `src/lib/effects/types.ts`
3. Import and register in `src/lib/effects/index.ts`
4. Add translations in `src/lib/i18n/translations/en.ts` and `es.ts`

### The Malfunction System

**Files:** `src/lib/effects/types.ts` (`poisonsAbility`), `src/lib/effects/index.ts` (`isMalfunctioning()`), `src/components/items/MalfunctionConfigStep.tsx`

The malfunction system handles Poisoned and Drunk effects. When a player is malfunctioning, their ability produces wrong results (for info roles), doesn't work (for action roles), and their passive effects are disabled.

#### Core Mechanism

Effects declare `poisonsAbility: true` to cause malfunction. The `isMalfunctioning()` helper checks if a player has any such effect:

```typescript
import { isMalfunctioning } from "../../../effects";

const malfunctioning = isMalfunctioning(player);
// true if player has any effect with poisonsAbility: true (e.g., "poisoned", "drunk")
```

#### How Malfunction Affects Each Role Category

| Category | Malfunction Behavior | Implementation |
|----------|---------------------|----------------|
| **Info roles (auto-calc)** (Chef, Empath) | Narrator picks false result via `MalfunctionConfigStep` | Conditional "Configure Malfunction" step before "Show Result" |
| **Info roles (narrator-setup)** (Washerwoman, Librarian, Investigator) | Narrator freely picks any players/roles | `malfunctioned: true` flag in history data; perception config skipped |
| **Info roles (death-triggered)** (Undertaker, Ravenkeeper) | Narrator picks false role via `MalfunctionConfigStep` | Conditional "Configure Malfunction" step; perception config skipped |
| **Info roles (boolean)** (Fortune Teller) | Narrator picks true/false via `MalfunctionConfigStep` | Conditional "Configure Malfunction" step with boolean picker |
| **Action roles** (Monk) | Effect is not applied | `addEffects` conditionally omitted when malfunctioning |
| **Demon** (Imp) | Kill intent is not emitted | `intent` conditionally omitted when malfunctioning |
| **Passive handlers** (Safe, Pure, Bounce, ScarletWoman) | Handler is completely skipped | `collectActiveHandlers()` in pipeline skips malfunctioning players |
| **Win conditions** (Martyrdom, Mayor) | Win condition is skipped | `checkDynamicWinConditions()` skips malfunctioning players |
| **Day actions** (Slayer) | Shot always misses | `isDemon` check overridden to `false` when malfunctioning |

#### Pipeline-Level Malfunction

The Intent Pipeline automatically handles malfunction for passive effects:

- `collectActiveHandlers()` skips ALL handlers from players who are malfunctioning — no individual handler modifications needed
- `checkDynamicWinConditions()` skips win conditions from malfunctioning players (both effect-based and role-based)

This means adding `poisonsAbility: true` to a new effect automatically disables all passive abilities for affected players.

#### MalfunctionConfigStep Component

**File:** `src/components/items/MalfunctionConfigStep.tsx`

A narrator-only screen for configuring false results when a role is malfunctioning. Supports three input types:

```typescript
type Props = {
    type: "number" | "boolean" | "role";
    roleIcon: string;
    roleName: string;
    playerName: string;
    // For "number" type:
    numberRange?: [number, number];
    onComplete: (value: number | boolean | string) => void;
    // For "boolean" type:
    trueLabel?: string;
    falseLabel?: string;
};
```

- **number**: Shown for Chef, Empath — narrator picks a false count
- **boolean**: Shown for Fortune Teller — narrator picks yes/no
- **role**: Shown for Undertaker, Ravenkeeper — narrator picks a false role to show

#### History Data Convention

When a role's action is malfunctioned, the history entry's `data` includes:
- `malfunctioned: true` — flags that this result was narrator-controlled
- `actualXxx` — the real value (e.g., `actualEvilPairs`, `actualResult`, `actualRoleId`)

This allows history replay and debugging to distinguish real results from malfunctioned ones.

## 6. The Intent Pipeline

**Files:** `src/lib/pipeline/types.ts`, `src/lib/pipeline/index.ts`, `src/lib/pipeline/resolvers.ts`

The Intent Pipeline is the core mechanism for decoupled role/effect interactions. Instead of roles checking for other roles' effects directly, they emit **Intents** that flow through a pipeline of **Handlers**.

### Intent Types

```typescript
type KillIntent = { type: "kill"; sourceId: string; targetId: string; cause: string };
type NominateIntent = { type: "nominate"; nominatorId: string; nomineeId: string };
type ExecuteIntent = { type: "execute"; playerId: string; cause: string };
type Intent = KillIntent | NominateIntent | ExecuteIntent;
```

### Pipeline Flow

```
  Role emits Intent
        │
        ▼
  collectActiveHandlers()     ← Gathers handlers from ALL players' active effects
        │
        ▼
  Sort by priority (ascending — lower numbers run first)
        │
        ▼
  ┌─── For each handler where appliesTo() returns true: ─────┐
  │                                                           │
  │   handler.handle() returns HandlerResult:                 │
  │                                                           │
  │   "allow"     → merge stateChanges, continue pipeline     │
  │   "prevent"   → merge stateChanges, stop pipeline         │
  │   "redirect"  → merge stateChanges, restart with new      │
  │                  intent (re-collects handlers)             │
  │   "request_ui" → pause pipeline, show UI component,       │
  │                   resume with narrator's input             │
  └───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
        │
        ▼ (if no handler prevented)
  Default Resolver runs
        │
        ▼
  PipelineResult returned (resolved | prevented | needs_input)
```

### IntentHandler

```typescript
type IntentHandler = {
    intentType: Intent["type"] | Intent["type"][];   // Which intents to handle
    priority: number;                                 // Lower = runs first
    appliesTo: (intent, effectPlayer, state) => boolean;  // Guard condition
    handle: (intent, effectPlayer, state, game) => HandlerResult;  // Logic
};
```

### HandlerResult

```typescript
type HandlerResult =
    | { action: "allow"; stateChanges?: StateChanges }
    | { action: "prevent"; reason: string; stateChanges?: StateChanges }
    | { action: "redirect"; newIntent: Intent; stateChanges?: StateChanges }
    | { action: "request_ui"; UIComponent: FC<PipelineInputProps>; resume: (result: unknown) => HandlerResult };
```

### StateChanges

The unified structure for describing changes across the pipeline:

```typescript
type StateChanges = {
    entries: Omit<HistoryEntry, "id" | "timestamp" | "stateAfter">[];
    stateUpdates?: Partial<GameState>;
    addEffects?: Record<string, EffectToAdd[]>;
    removeEffects?: Record<string, string[]>;
};
```

Multiple `StateChanges` from different handlers are merged via `mergeStateChanges()`.

### Default Resolvers

**File:** `src/lib/pipeline/resolvers.ts`

If no handler prevents an intent, a **default resolver** runs:

| Intent | Default Resolver |
|--------|-----------------|
| `kill` | Adds `dead` effect to target |
| `nominate` | Creates nomination entry, transitions to voting phase |
| `execute` | Creates execution entry, adds `dead` effect |

### Priority Conventions

| Priority | Use Case |
|----------|----------|
| 1-5 | Redirect handlers (Bounce) — run before protection so redirect happens first |
| 6-10 | Protection handlers (Safe) — can prevent after redirect |
| 11-20 | Modification handlers — alter intent details |
| 21+ | Observation handlers — react without changing |

### Example: Kill Intent Flow (Imp → Bounce → Safe)

1. **Imp** emits `{ type: "kill", sourceId: "imp", targetId: "mayor", cause: "demon" }`
2. Pipeline collects handlers: **Bounce** (priority 5), **Safe** (priority 10)
3. **Bounce** handler: target has bounce effect → returns `request_ui` with `BounceRedirectUI`
4. Narrator selects new target → `resume()` called → returns `redirect` with new target
5. Pipeline restarts with new intent `{ ...kill, targetId: "newTarget" }`
6. **Safe** handler: if new target has safe effect → returns `prevent`; otherwise continues
7. If not prevented: default resolver adds `dead` effect to target

### How to add a new intent type

1. Add the intent type to the `Intent` union in `pipeline/types.ts`
2. Add a default resolver in `pipeline/resolvers.ts`
3. Emit the intent from the appropriate role or game function

---

## 7. The Perception System

**Files:** `src/lib/pipeline/perception.ts`, `src/lib/pipeline/types.ts`

The Perception System decouples information-gathering roles from roles that alter their perceived identity (Recluse, Spy, etc.).

### Core Concept

Information roles never check `getRole(player.roleId).team` directly. Instead, they call:

```typescript
const perception = perceive(targetPlayer, observerPlayer, context, state);
// perception = { roleId, team, alignment }
```

This starts with the target's actual identity, then applies **perception modifiers** from the target's active effects.

### Perception Types

```typescript
type PerceptionContext = "alignment" | "team" | "role";

type Perception = {
    roleId: string;          // What role they appear to be
    team: TeamId;            // What team they appear on
    alignment: "good" | "evil"; // What alignment they appear to have
};

type PerceptionModifier = {
    context: PerceptionContext | PerceptionContext[];  // When to apply
    observerRoles?: string[];  // Optional: only for specific observer roles
    modify: (
        perception: Perception,
        targetPlayer: PlayerState,
        observerPlayer: PlayerState,
        state: GameState,
        effectData?: Record<string, unknown>  // Data from the EffectInstance
    ) => Perception;
};
```

### PerceptionContext

| Context | Used By | What It Queries |
|---------|---------|-----------------|
| `"alignment"` | Chef, Empath | Is this player good or evil? |
| `"team"` | Washerwoman, Librarian, Investigator | What team is this player on? |
| `"role"` | Fortune Teller, Undertaker, Ravenkeeper | What specific role is this player? |

### How Roles Use Perception

**Auto-calculating roles** (Chef, Empath):
```typescript
const perception = perceive(targetPlayer, chefPlayer, "alignment", state);
const isEvil = perception.alignment === "evil";
```

**Narrator-setup roles** (Washerwoman, Librarian, Investigator):
```typescript
// For team highlighting in player lists:
const perception = perceive(p, observerPlayer, "team", state);
const registersTownsfolk = perception.team === "townsfolk";

// For role display in step 2:
const pPerception = perceive(p, observerPlayer, "role", state);
const perceivedRole = getRole(pPerception.roleId);
```

**Role-reveal roles** (Undertaker, Ravenkeeper):
```typescript
const perception = perceive(executedPlayer, undertakerPlayer, "role", state);
const executedRole = getRole(perception.roleId);
```

### Perception Query Utilities

**File:** `src/lib/pipeline/perception.ts` (all exported from `src/lib/pipeline/index.ts`)

Beyond `perceive()` and `canRegisterAsTeam()`, the perception system provides utilities for detecting and configuring ambiguous perceptions at runtime.

#### `canRegisterAsAlignment(player, alignment)`

Companion to `canRegisterAsTeam()`. Returns `true` if the player has any active effect whose `canRegisterAs.alignments` includes the target alignment. Used by auto-calculating roles (Chef, Empath) to detect players that may need perception configuration.

```typescript
canRegisterAsAlignment(reclusePlayer, "evil"); // true (recluse_misregister declares it)
canRegisterAsAlignment(villagerPlayer, "evil"); // false
```

#### `getAmbiguousPlayers(players, context)`

Returns the subset of `players` that have effects declaring `canRegisterAs` for the given perception context. This is how roles detect "do I need a perception config step?" **without referencing any specific role or effect**.

```typescript
const ambiguous = getAmbiguousPlayers(state.players.filter(isAlive), "alignment");
// Returns players with effects that declare canRegisterAs.alignments (e.g., Recluse)
```

Context matching rules:
- `"alignment"` → checks `canRegisterAs.alignments`
- `"team"` → checks `canRegisterAs.teams`
- `"role"` → checks both (misregistration at any level affects role perception)

#### `applyPerceptionOverrides(state, overrides)`

Creates a **local-only copy** of `GameState` where each overridden player's misregistration effect has `perceiveAs` data injected. No game events are emitted — this is purely ephemeral.

```typescript
const overrides = { [recluseId]: { alignment: "evil" } };
const localState = applyPerceptionOverrides(state, overrides);
// Now perceive(recluse, observer, "alignment", localState).alignment === "evil"
```

This works because `recluse_misregister`'s perception modifier already reads `effectData?.perceiveAs`. The function finds effects with `canRegisterAs` on the target players and injects the overrides as `perceiveAs` data into those effect instances.

### PerceptionConfigStep Component

**File:** `src/components/items/PerceptionConfigStep.tsx`

A narrator-only screen where the narrator configures how ambiguous players register for a specific role's information ability. Used as a step within `NightAction` components.

```typescript
type Props = {
    ambiguousPlayers: PlayerState[];     // From getAmbiguousPlayers()
    context: PerceptionContext;          // What aspect is being configured
    state: GameState;
    roleIcon: string;
    roleName: string;
    playerName: string;
    onComplete: (overrides: Record<string, Partial<Perception>>) => void;
};
```

For each ambiguous player, it shows:
- The player's name, actual role, and the effect granting misregistration
- Toggle buttons for how they should register (e.g., "Good" vs "Evil" for alignment context)

The overrides returned are `{ [playerId]: { alignment: "evil" } }` etc. The calling `NightAction` component passes these to `applyPerceptionOverrides()` to create a modified local state for calculations.

### How Auto-Calculating Roles Use Perception Overrides

Roles like Chef and Empath follow this pattern:

1. Check `getAmbiguousPlayers(relevantPlayers, "alignment")` — if non-empty, show a perception config step
2. The narrator configures overrides via `PerceptionConfigStep`
3. The overrides are stored in component state (never emitted as game events)
4. `applyPerceptionOverrides(state, overrides)` creates a local modified state
5. The role calculates its result using `perceive()` on the modified state
6. The result is shown to the player and recorded in history as usual

This keeps perception configuration **fully modular** — roles detect ambiguity through `canRegisterAs` declarations on effects, not by checking for specific roles.

### How to Add Perception Modifiers

On an `EffectDefinition`, add `perceptionModifiers`. Example for a hypothetical "misregister" effect:

```typescript
perceptionModifiers: [{
    context: ["alignment", "team", "role"],
    modify: (perception, _target, _observer, _state, effectData) => {
        const overrides = effectData?.perceiveAs as Partial<Perception> | undefined;
        if (!overrides) return perception;
        return { ...perception, ...overrides };
    },
}]
```

The narrator would configure the effect's instance data when assigning it (e.g., `{ perceiveAs: { team: "minion", alignment: "evil", roleId: "poisoner" } }`).

### How to Make a New Effect Trigger Perception Configuration

If a new effect should cause narrator configuration for information roles:

1. Add `canRegisterAs` to the effect definition declaring what it can misregister as:
   ```typescript
   canRegisterAs: {
       teams?: TeamId[];           // e.g., ["minion", "demon"]
       alignments?: ("good" | "evil")[];  // e.g., ["evil"]
   }
   ```

2. Add a `perceptionModifiers` entry that reads `effectData?.perceiveAs` (same pattern as `recluse_misregister`).

3. No changes needed in any role — `getAmbiguousPlayers()` will automatically detect the new effect, and `PerceptionConfigStep` + `applyPerceptionOverrides()` will handle the configuration flow.

---

## 8. Day Actions

Day actions are abilities that can be used during the day phase. They are registered on effects via `dayActions`.

### DayActionDefinition

```typescript
type DayActionDefinition = {
    id: string;
    icon: IconName;
    getLabel: (t) => string;         // i18n label
    getDescription: (t) => string;   // i18n description
    condition: (player, state) => boolean;  // When is this action available?
    ActionComponent: FC<DayActionProps>;    // The UI for this action
};

type DayActionProps = {
    state: GameState;
    playerId: string;
    onComplete: (result: DayActionResult) => void;
    onBack: () => void;
};

type DayActionResult = {
    entries: Omit<HistoryEntry, "id" | "timestamp" | "stateAfter">[];
    addEffects?: Record<string, EffectToAdd[]>;
    removeEffects?: Record<string, string[]>;
};
```

### How Day Actions Are Collected

`getAvailableDayActions(state, t)` in `pipeline/index.ts` iterates over all players' effects, checks each `DayActionDefinition.condition`, and returns an `AvailableDayAction[]` array. `DayPhase.tsx` renders these as buttons.

### Current Day Actions

- **Slayer Shot** (`slayer_bullet` effect): Allows the Slayer to attempt to kill a player during the day

---

## 9. Night Follow-Ups

**Files:** `src/lib/pipeline/types.ts`, `src/lib/pipeline/index.ts`

Night follow-ups are reactive actions that appear in the Night Dashboard during the night phase. They are registered on effects via `nightFollowUps`, following the same pattern as `dayActions`. Follow-ups are used for consequences of night events — e.g., the Scarlet Woman needs a role change reveal after the Demon dies.

### NightFollowUpDefinition

```typescript
type NightFollowUpDefinition = {
    id: string;
    icon: IconName;
    getLabel: (t) => string;                               // i18n label
    condition: (player, state, game) => boolean;            // When is this follow-up needed?
    ActionComponent: FC<NightFollowUpProps>;                // The UI for this follow-up
};

type NightFollowUpProps = {
    state: GameState;
    game: Game;
    playerId: string;
    onComplete: (result: NightFollowUpResult) => void;
};

type NightFollowUpResult = {
    entries: Omit<HistoryEntry, "id" | "timestamp" | "stateAfter">[];
    addEffects?: Record<string, EffectToAdd[]>;
    removeEffects?: Record<string, string[]>;
};
```

### How Night Follow-Ups Are Collected

`getAvailableNightFollowUps(state, game, t)` in `pipeline/index.ts` iterates over all players' effects, checks each `NightFollowUpDefinition.condition`, and returns an `AvailableNightFollowUp[]` array. The `NightDashboard` merges these with regular night actions into a unified list.

### How Night Follow-Ups Work

1. An effect handler creates a consequence (e.g., Scarlet Woman handler changes the player's role)
2. The handler also adds an effect with `nightFollowUps` (e.g., `pending_role_reveal`)
3. When the Night Dashboard re-renders, `getAvailableNightFollowUps()` picks up the new follow-up
4. The follow-up appears as a clickable item in the night action list (with distinct purple styling)
5. The narrator taps it, the follow-up's `ActionComponent` renders
6. On completion, the result is applied (history entries, effect removal) and the dashboard updates

### Key Design: Follow-ups disappear when done

Follow-ups are condition-based. When a follow-up's `ActionComponent` calls `onComplete`, it typically removes the effect that triggered it (e.g., `removeEffects: { [playerId]: ["pending_role_reveal"] }`). This causes the condition to become false, so the follow-up no longer appears in the list. This is consistent with how `dayActions` work — the Slayer bullet disappears after use.

### Current Night Follow-Ups

| Follow-Up | Effect | Trigger | Purpose |
|-----------|--------|---------|---------|
| Role Change Reveal | `pending_role_reveal` | Added by Scarlet Woman handler when Demon dies | Shows the player's new RoleCard so the narrator can reveal the role change |

### The `pending_role_reveal` pattern

This is a **generic, reusable effect** for any role change. Any effect handler that changes a player's role should add `pending_role_reveal` to that player:

```typescript
// In a handler's stateChanges:
addEffects: {
    [playerId]: [{ type: "pending_role_reveal", expiresAt: "never" }],
},
changeRoles: {
    [playerId]: newRoleId,
},
```

The `pending_role_reveal` effect's `nightFollowUp` has `condition: () => true` — if the effect exists, the reveal is needed. The follow-up's `ActionComponent` shows a RoleCard with "Your role has changed!" and creates a `role_change_revealed` history entry on completion.

---

## 10. Win Conditions

Win conditions are checked at multiple points during the game.

### Core Win Conditions (in `game.ts`)

1. **Good wins** if all demons are dead
2. **Evil wins** if only 2 players remain (and one is a demon)

### Dynamic Win Conditions

Effects and roles can declare `winConditions`:

```typescript
type WinConditionTrigger = "after_execution" | "end_of_day" | "after_state_change";

type WinConditionCheck = {
    trigger: WinConditionTrigger;
    check: (state: GameState, game: Game) => "townsfolk" | "demon" | null;
};
```

`checkDynamicWinConditions()` in `pipeline/index.ts` iterates over all players' effects and roles, checking win conditions that match the given triggers.

### Current Dynamic Win Conditions

| Source | Trigger | Condition |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| `martyrdom` effect (Saint) | `after_execution` | Evil wins if player with martyrdom is executed |
| `mayor` role | `end_of_day` | Good wins if 3 alive, no execution today, Mayor alive |

---

## 11. The Screen State Machine

**File:** `src/components/screens/GameScreen.tsx`

`GameScreen` is the central orchestrator. It maintains a `screen` state that determines what UI is shown.

### Screen Types

```
setup_actions → setup_action (narrator configures pre-revelation settings, e.g., Drunk)
role_revelation → showing_role (tap player to show role card)
night_dashboard → night_action (process a role's night action)
                → night_follow_up (process a reactive follow-up, e.g., role change reveal)
                → pipeline_input (when pipeline requests UI during night action resolution)
day → nomination → voting
    → day_action
    → pipeline_input
game_over
grimoire_role_card (from grimoire modal, returns to previous screen)
```

### Night Dashboard Flow

The Night Dashboard (`NightDashboard.tsx`) is the central hub for the night phase. It displays a unified list of:
1. **Regular night actions** — from `getNightRolesStatus(game)` (roles with `nightOrder`)
2. **Night follow-ups** — from `getAvailableNightFollowUps(state, game, t)` (reactive actions from effects)

The list is ordered: regular actions first (by `nightOrder`), follow-ups appended at the end. Only the next pending item is clickable. `allDone` is derived from the combined list — no pending items means the narrator can proceed to day.

### Critical Flow: Night Action → Pipeline

```
1. Narrator taps next action in Night Dashboard
2. Screen transitions to "night_action" with playerId + roleId
3. NightAction component renders NightStepListLayout (step list landing page)
4. Narrator taps through steps (perception config, player selection, etc.)
5. Final step calls onComplete(result)
5. applyNightAction(game, result) — applies direct changes
6. If result.intent exists:
   - resolveIntent(intent, state, game) — runs pipeline
   - processPipelineResult(result) handles the outcome:
     * "resolved" → applyPipelineChanges(), check win, return to dashboard
     * "prevented" → applyPipelineChanges(), check win, return to dashboard
     * "needs_input" → show pipeline_input screen with UIComponent
7. If no intent: check win, return to dashboard
```

### Night Follow-Up Flow

```
1. Narrator taps a follow-up item in Night Dashboard
2. Screen transitions to "night_follow_up" with the AvailableNightFollowUp data
3. The follow-up's ActionComponent renders (e.g., RoleCard for role change reveal)
4. ActionComponent calls onComplete(result)
5. Result is applied via applyPipelineChanges() (entries, effects)
6. Screen returns to night_dashboard — follow-up disappears from list
```

### Pipeline Input Screen

When the pipeline returns `needs_input`:
1. `pipelineUI` state is set with the `UIComponent`, `intent`, and `resume` callback
2. The screen type becomes `pipeline_input`
3. The component renders, narrator makes a choice
4. `onComplete` calls `resume()` which returns a new `PipelineResult`
5. `processPipelineResult()` handles the new result (may chain into more UI)

---

## 12. UI Components

### Component Hierarchy

```
atoms/     → Basic primitives: Button, Icon, Badge, Card, Dialog
inputs/    → Form elements: PlayerSelector, SelectablePlayerItem, VoteButton
items/     → Game-specific: Grimoire, RoleCard, EditEffectsModal, BounceRedirectUI,
              PerceptionConfigStep, MalfunctionConfigStep
layouts/   → Screen wrappers: NightActionLayout, NarratorSetupLayout, NightStepListLayout
screens/   → Full screens: GameScreen, RoleRevelationScreen, SetupActionsScreen,
              NightDashboard, DayPhase, VotingPhase, NominationScreen
```

### Layout Components

**`NightActionLayout`** — For showing information to the player. Used by info roles (Chef, Empath, etc.) and the Ravenkeeper. Renders with player info, title, description, and children.

**`NarratorSetupLayout`** — For narrator-only setup screens. Used by Washerwoman, Librarian, Investigator, Fortune Teller. Has a "Show to Player" button to transition from narrator setup to player view.

**`NightStepListLayout`** — Landing page shown when a night action begins. Displays a numbered step list with role header and status tracking. Every role with a `NightAction` starts here before entering its actual action flow. See [§4: Night Action Steps](#night-action-steps-nightsteplistlayout) for details.

### Game-Specific Items

**`PerceptionConfigStep`** — Narrator-only screen for configuring how ambiguous players register for an information ability. Used as a step within multi-step night actions. See [§7: PerceptionConfigStep](#perceptionconfigstep-component) for details.

**`MalfunctionConfigStep`** — Narrator-only screen for providing false results when a role is malfunctioning (Poisoned/Drunk). Supports number, boolean, and role input types. See [§5: The Malfunction System](#the-malfunction-system) for details.

### Icon System

**File:** `src/components/atoms/icon.tsx`

Icons are referenced by `IconName` string. The `Icon` component maps these to Lucide React icons. When adding new roles or effects, check if the needed icon exists in the `IconName` type. Add new Lucide icon mappings if needed.

---

## 13. Internationalization (i18n)

**Files:** `src/lib/i18n/`

### Usage

```typescript
const { t } = useI18n();
// t.game.choosePlayerToKill, t.roles.imp.name, t.effects.dead.name, etc.
```

### Structure

Translations are organized under keys: `common`, `mainMenu`, `newGame`, `game`, `teams`, `roles`, `effects`, `ui`, `history`, `scripts`.

Every role needs entries in `t.roles[roleId]` with at least `name` and `description`. Every effect needs entries in `t.effects[effectId]` with at least `name`.

### Adding Translations

When adding a new role or effect, add translations in **both** `src/lib/i18n/translations/en.ts` and `src/lib/i18n/translations/es.ts`. Update the `Translations` type in `src/lib/i18n/types.ts` if adding new top-level keys.

---

## 14. How to Implement a New Role

### Step-by-step

1. **Decide the behavior category:**
   - Does it have a night action? → Implement `NightAction` component
   - Is it purely passive? → Set `NightAction: null`, implement behavior via effects
   - Does it gather information? → Use `perceive()` in the night action

2. **Create the role definition file:**
   - Place in `src/lib/roles/definition/trouble-brewing/` (or the relevant script folder)
   - Export a `const definition: RoleDefinition` as default

3. **Implement the NightAction with step list:**
   - Every `NightAction` must start by rendering `NightStepListLayout` as its landing page
   - Use `useState<Phase>` to track which step/phase is active (start with `"step_list"`)
   - Declare `nightSteps` on the role definition for metadata (conditional steps use `condition`)
   - Build the `NightStep[]` array at runtime using `useMemo` (combining step metadata with status tracking)
   - If the role uses `perceive()` for auto-calculation, check `getAmbiguousPlayers()` to decide whether a `PerceptionConfigStep` is needed
   - Use `applyPerceptionOverrides()` to create a local modified state for calculations
   - Even single-step roles must show the step list for consistency

4. **Add malfunction support:**
   - If the role has a night action, check `isMalfunctioning(player)` at the start
   - For **info roles**: add a conditional `MalfunctionConfigStep` where the narrator provides false results
   - For **action roles**: conditionally skip the `addEffects` or `intent` when malfunctioning
   - For **passive roles**: no action needed — the pipeline automatically skips handlers/win conditions for malfunctioning players
   - Always include `malfunctioned: true` in history `data` when the result was affected by malfunction

5. **Register the role:**
   - Add the role ID to the `RoleId` union in `src/lib/roles/types.ts`
   - Import and add to `ROLES` in `src/lib/roles/index.ts`
   - Add to the relevant script in `SCRIPTS`

6. **Create effects if needed:**
   - If the role has passive abilities, create effect definitions
   - Register effects in `src/lib/effects/index.ts` and `types.ts`
   - Add effect to `initialEffects` on the role definition

7. **Add translations:**
   - Add to `en.ts` and `es.ts` under `roles[roleId]`
   - Add effect translations if new effects were created

8. **Never modify `game.ts`** for role-specific logic. Use effects and the pipeline instead.

## 15. How to Implement a New Effect

### Step-by-step

1. **Create the effect definition** in `src/lib/effects/definition/`
2. **Register it:**
   - Add to `EffectId` union in `src/lib/effects/types.ts`
   - Import and register in `src/lib/effects/index.ts`
3. **Add translations** in both language files
4. **Wire it up** — assign to a role via `initialEffects`, or add dynamically via `addEffects` in night actions

### When to use each capability

| I want to... | Use... |
|--------------|--------|
| Prevent a player from being killed | `handlers` with `intentType: "kill"`, return `{ action: "prevent" }` |
| Redirect a kill to someone else | `handlers` with `intentType: "kill"`, return `{ action: "redirect" }` |
| Need narrator input during pipeline | `handlers` returning `{ action: "request_ui" }` |
| Give a player a day-phase ability | `dayActions` with condition + ActionComponent |
| React to a night event with a follow-up action | `nightFollowUps` with condition + ActionComponent |
| Show a role change reveal after transformation | Add `pending_role_reveal` effect (it has a built-in `nightFollowUp`) |
| Create a custom win condition | `winConditions` with trigger + check |
| Make a player register differently to info roles | `perceptionModifiers` + `canRegisterAs` (see §7) |
| Enable narrator perception config for info roles | `canRegisterAs: { teams?, alignments? }` on the effect |
| Prevent a player from waking at night | `preventsNightWake: true` |
| Prevent voting | `preventsVoting: true` or `canVote` function |
| Make a player's ability malfunction | `poisonsAbility: true` on the effect (detected by `isMalfunctioning()`) |

## 16. How to Add a New Intent Type

If you need a new category of game action that should be interceptable:

1. **Define the intent type** in `src/lib/pipeline/types.ts`:
   ```typescript
   type MyNewIntent = { type: "my_new"; /* fields */ };
   ```
   Add it to the `Intent` union.

2. **Add a default resolver** in `src/lib/pipeline/resolvers.ts`:
   ```typescript
   function resolveMyNew(intent: Intent, state: GameState): StateChanges { ... }
   // Add to the resolvers record
   ```

3. **Emit the intent** from the relevant role or game function.

4. **Optionally add effect handlers** that intercept this new intent type.

## 17. Testing

**Framework:** Vitest (integrated with Vite)

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Run a specific test file
pnpm test src/lib/roles/definition/trouble-brewing/Chef.test.ts

# Run tests matching a pattern
pnpm test Chef
```

Tests are configured in `vite.config.ts` to include `src/**/*.test.{ts,tsx}`.

### Test Structure

Tests are co-located with the files they test:

```
src/lib/
├── __tests__/
│   ├── helpers.ts              # Shared test utilities (makePlayer, makeState, etc.)
│   ├── game.test.ts            # Game controller integration tests
│   ├── pipeline.test.ts        # Intent pipeline integration tests
│   ├── perception.test.ts      # Perception system tests
│   ├── effects.test.ts         # Effect handler integration tests
│   ├── winConditions.test.ts   # Win condition tests
│   └── nightFollowUps.test.ts  # Night follow-up collection + integration tests
├── roles/definition/
│   ├── Imp.test.ts
│   └── trouble-brewing/
│       ├── Chef.test.ts
│       ├── Empath.test.ts
│       └── ...
└── effects/definition/
    ├── Safe.test.ts
    ├── Pure.test.ts
    ├── PendingRoleReveal.test.ts
    └── ...
```

### What to Test

Tests must validate **features and behavior**, not definition metadata. Do not test `id`, `team`, `icon`, `nightOrder`, or other static properties.

| Category | What to test |
|----------|-------------|
| **Information roles** (Chef, Empath, Washerwoman, etc.) | `shouldWake` conditions, perception integration including **deception** (false positives and false negatives via perception modifiers) |
| **Action roles** (Imp, Monk) | `shouldWake` conditions |
| **Passive roles** (Soldier, Virgin, Slayer, Saint) | Nothing — just an empty test delegating to the corresponding effect test file |
| **Role win conditions** (Mayor) | The `check` function with various game states (trigger conditions, edge cases) |
| **Effect handlers** (Safe, Pure, Bounce, ScarletWoman) | `appliesTo` guard, `handle` logic (action type, stateChanges, history entries) |
| **Effect day actions** (SlayerBullet) | `condition` function (alive checks, effect presence) |
| **Effect night follow-ups** (PendingRoleReveal) | `condition` function, metadata (id, icon), `ActionComponent` presence, integration with `getAvailableNightFollowUps()` |
| **Effect win conditions** (Martyrdom) | `check` function with matching and non-matching history entries |
| **Effect behavior flags** (Dead, UsedDeadVote) | `canVote`, `canNominate`, `preventsNightWake`, etc. |
| **Malfunction effects** (Poisoned, Drunk) | `poisonsAbility: true` flag, `isMalfunctioning()` helper |
| **Pipeline malfunction integration** | Handlers skipped for malfunctioning players, win conditions skipped |

### Testing Perception Deception

To test that information roles handle deception correctly (e.g., a Recluse appearing evil to the Chef), mock `getEffect` to inject a test effect with perception modifiers:

```typescript
import { vi } from "vitest";
import { EffectDefinition, EffectId } from "../../../effects/types";

vi.mock("../../../effects", async (importOriginal) => {
    const actual = (await importOriginal()) as Record<string, unknown>;
    return {
        ...actual,
        getEffect: (effectId: string) => {
            if (testEffects[effectId]) return testEffects[effectId];
            return (actual.getEffect as (id: string) => EffectDefinition | undefined)(effectId);
        },
    };
});

const testEffects: Record<string, EffectDefinition> = {};

// In tests:
testEffects["appears_evil"] = {
    id: "appears_evil" as EffectId,
    icon: "user",
    perceptionModifiers: [{
        context: "alignment",
        modify: (p) => ({ ...p, alignment: "evil" }),
    }],
};
const player = addEffectTo(makePlayer({ roleId: "villager" }), "appears_evil");
// Now `perceive(player, observer, "alignment", state).alignment` === "evil"
```

Always test both directions:
- **False positive**: a good player appearing evil/wrong team
- **False negative**: an evil player appearing good/different team

### Test Helpers

`src/lib/__tests__/helpers.ts` provides:

| Helper | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `makePlayer({ id, roleId, ... })` | Creates a `PlayerState` |
| `addEffectTo(player, effectType, data?, expiresAt?)` | Returns a new player with the effect added |
| `makeState({ phase, round, players })` | Creates a `GameState` |
| `makeGame(state?)` | Creates a `Game` with a single history entry |
| `makeGameWithHistory(entries, baseState?)` | Creates a `Game` with specific history entries |
| `makeStandardPlayers()` | Creates a standard 5-player set |
| `resetPlayerCounter()` | Resets the auto-incrementing player counter (call in `beforeEach`) |

### Empty Tests

If a role or effect has no testable behavior of its own (e.g., Villager, or roles whose behavior is entirely on a separate effect), create a minimal test:

```typescript
import { it, expect } from "vitest";

it("Villager has no testable features", () => {
    expect(true);
});
```

### After Modifying Code

Always run lints after editing files to catch issues:

```bash
# Check lints on modified files (use ReadLints tool in Cursor)
# Then run the full test suite
pnpm test
```

Tests run as a required step in the CI/CD pipeline (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) before building. A failing test will block deployment.

## 18. Rules and Anti-Patterns

### DO

- **Use `perceive()` in all information roles** — never check `getRole(player.roleId).team` directly when gathering information for a player ability.
- **Emit intents for any action that should be interceptable** — kills, nominations, executions. Don't apply state changes directly if other effects might need to react.
- **Put passive abilities on effects, not roles** — the role definition should be thin. Use `initialEffects` to attach behavior.
- **Return `stateChanges` from handlers** — don't modify game state directly inside a handler. Return the changes and let the pipeline merge and apply them.
- **Use `expiresAt` for temporary effects** — Monk's protection expires at `"end_of_night"`. Don't manually track removal.
- **Add history entries for every significant action** — the game's undo/history system depends on the event log being complete.
- **Use i18n keys for all user-facing text** — never hardcode English strings in components.
- **Always start NightAction with NightStepListLayout** — every role with a night action must render a step list landing page first, even for single-step roles. This ensures narrator safety and consistency.
- **Use `getAmbiguousPlayers()` to detect perception ambiguity** — never hardcode checks for specific roles (like "Recluse") inside information role logic. Use the generic perception query utilities to discover ambiguous players via `canRegisterAs` declarations.
- **Use `applyPerceptionOverrides()` for local perception configuration** — perception overrides from `PerceptionConfigStep` are ephemeral. Never emit game events for perception configuration choices; create a local modified state instead.
- **Use `isMalfunctioning()` to check for ability malfunction** — never hardcode checks for `"poisoned"` or `"drunk"` effect IDs. The generic helper reads `poisonsAbility` from effect definitions.
- **Add malfunction support to every new role with a night action** — info roles need `MalfunctionConfigStep` for false results, action roles need conditional effect/intent omission.

### DON'T

- **Never add role-specific logic to `game.ts`** — if you find yourself writing `if (roleId === "my_role")` in the game controller, you're doing it wrong. Use effects and the pipeline.
- **Never import one role from another role's definition** — roles must be completely independent. Use effects and the pipeline for interactions.
- **Never import effect definitions from role definitions** — roles can import from `effects/types.ts` for type info, but should not import specific effect definitions.
- **Never mutate state** — always return new objects. The event-sourced architecture depends on immutability.
- **Never skip the pipeline for interceptable actions** — even if there are currently no handlers for an intent type, still use the pipeline. Future effects may need to intercept it.
- **Never check `player.roleId` to determine team/alignment in info role logic** — always use `perceive()`. Direct checks bypass the perception system.
- **Never hardcode effect checks in `GameScreen.tsx`, `DayPhase.tsx`, or `NightDashboard.tsx`** — use `getAvailableDayActions()`, `getAvailableNightFollowUps()`, and `checkDynamicWinConditions()` instead.
- **Never hardcode role/effect names in `getAmbiguousPlayers()` checks** — the perception query utilities are generic by design. If you find yourself writing `if (effectId === "recluse_misregister")` in a role's night action, you're doing it wrong. Use `canRegisterAs` declarations and let the system detect ambiguity automatically.
- **Never skip the step list for NightAction components** — even single-step roles must render `NightStepListLayout` first. The step list is the narrator's safety net before player-facing screens.
- **Never hardcode `"poisoned"` or `"drunk"` checks in role/effect logic** — use `isMalfunctioning()` which checks the `poisonsAbility` flag. This allows future malfunction effects to work automatically.

### Handler Priority Guidelines

- **1-5**: Redirects (change the target before anything else checks)
- **6-10**: Protection (prevent the action)
- **11-20**: Modification (alter details without preventing)
- **21+**: Observation (react without changing the outcome)

### File Naming Conventions

- Role definitions: PascalCase matching the role name (e.g., `FortuneTeller.tsx`)
- Effect definitions: PascalCase matching the effect name (e.g., `SlayerBullet.ts`)
- Roles with UI use `.tsx`; effects without UI use `.ts`
- Components: PascalCase (e.g., `BounceRedirectUI.tsx`)

### Import Guidelines

- Roles can import from: `../types`, `../../types`, `../../i18n`, `../index` (for `getRole`), `../../effects` (for `isMalfunctioning`), `../../pipeline` (for `perceive`, `getAmbiguousPlayers`, `applyPerceptionOverrides`), and UI components (including `NightStepListLayout`, `PerceptionConfigStep`, `MalfunctionConfigStep`)
- Effects can import from: `../types`, `../../pipeline/types`, `../../types`, and UI components (for `request_ui`)
- Pipeline can import from: `../types`, `../effects`, `../roles/index`, `../teams`
- `game.ts` can import from: `./types`, `./roles`, `./pipeline`, `./roles/types`
