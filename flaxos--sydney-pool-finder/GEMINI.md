# Sydney Pool Table Finder — CLAUDE.md

## Project Overview

A web app for finding pool tables across Sydney. Inspired by a community-maintained Google My Maps project that manually tracks venues with pool tables. This app aims to make that data searchable, filterable, and crowd-sourceable.

**Owner:** maintainer
**Stack:** React + Vite, Leaflet (OpenStreetMap), TailwindCSS, JSON flat-file data (upgrade path to SQLite/Supabase later)
**Target:** Mobile-first responsive web app, deployable as a static site or PWA

## Data Model — Venue

Each venue is a JSON object:

```json
{
  "id": "string (kebab-case slug, e.g. 'town-hall-hotel-newtown')",
  "name": "string",
  "address": "string (full street address)",
  "suburb": "string",
  "lat": -33.xxxx,
  "lng": 151.xxxx,
  "tables": {
    "count": 2,
    "brands": ["Diamond", "Brunswick"],
    "feltColour": "green",
    "feltNotes": "leopard print on table 2"
  },
  "pricing": {
    "standard": "$2 per game",
    "happyHour": "$1 pool 4-6pm weekdays",
    "freeNights": ["Tuesday"],
    "compNights": ["Thursday"]
  },
  "features": ["comp night", "free pool", "happy hour", "outdoor area", "food available"],
  "status": "verified | unverified | closed",
  "source": "community | google-maps-import",
  "lastVerified": "2026-03-20",
  "notes": "string (free text, quirks, vibes)"
}
```

### v0.4 — Android App + UX Polish
- [ ] Configure Capacitor for Android wrapper (or TWA if sticking pure-PWA)
- [ ] Test PWA install flow on Android Chrome — fix any manifest/service worker issues
- [ ] Set up Play Store developer account + create store listing (screenshots, description, privacy policy)
- [ ] Build signed APK/AAB and submit to Play Store internal testing track
- [ ] Implement marker clustering via `react-leaflet-cluster` for zoomed-out views (130+ markers overlap badly)
- [ ] Add dark mode toggle — persist preference in localStorage, respect `prefers-color-scheme`
- [ ] Improve mobile bottom sheet gestures — snap points (peek / half / full), swipe-to-dismiss
- [ ] Add first-run onboarding overlay (3 panels: map basics, filters, "near me" + suggest venue)
- [ ] Add pull-to-refresh on venue list (mobile)
- [ ] Promote Play Store listing to production track after internal testing passes

### v0.5 — Data Quality + Admin Panel + CI/CD

## Agent Instructions

### General
- This is a **React + Vite** project. Use functional components with hooks. No class components.
- Use **TailwindCSS** utility classes for all styling. No CSS modules, no styled-components.
- Use **Leaflet** via `react-leaflet` for the map. OpenStreetMap tiles (free, no API key needed).
- Data lives in `src/data/venues.json` for now. All venue access goes through `useVenues` hook so the data source can be swapped later without touching components.
- Mobile-first. Default layout assumes phone viewport. Desktop gets a side panel.

### Code Style
- Australian English in UI copy and comments (e.g. "colour" not "color" in user-facing strings; code variables use US English per JS convention).
- Prefer named exports for components, default export for pages/App.
- Keep components under 150 lines. Extract hooks and utils early.
- No `any` types if we move to TypeScript later — write JS that would type-check.

### Testing
- No test framework yet. But components should be pure enough to test.
- If adding tests later: Vitest + React Testing Library.

### Don't
- Don't use Google Maps API (requires billing, the whole point is FOSS).
- Don't over-engineer auth or a backend. This is a static data app for now.
- Don't add a database until the JSON file exceeds ~500 venues.
- Don't use Next.js or SSR. This is a client-side SPA deployed as static files.

## Deployment Notes

- Target: static hosting (GitHub Pages, Cloudflare Pages, or self-hosted via Nginx/Caddy).
- `vite build` should produce a clean `/dist` folder ready to serve.
- No environment variables needed for MVP (no API keys).

## Data Seeding

A community-maintained Google My Maps project is the initial data source:
- URL: `https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=189NmdRJKmw4jtRT4cT_ehq-4evUc9q4`
- Legend: Blue marker = one table, 8-ball emoji = multiple tables
- Manual conversion needed — export KML from Google My Maps, parse venue names + coordinates, enrich with table/pricing data over time.

KML export approach:
1. Open the map in Google My Maps editor (or use the KML download link)
2. Parse `<Placemark>` elements for name + coordinates
3. Map to venue schema with `status: "unverified"` and `source: "google-maps-import"`
4. Manually enrich top venues first (table count, brand, pricing)

---

## Context

This originated from a Slack channel where a colleague shared their Google My Maps project tracking every pool table venue in Sydney. Community feedback requested: table brand tracking, happy hour / pricing info, felt colour, comp nights. This app is the "someone who knows how to code" answer to that.
