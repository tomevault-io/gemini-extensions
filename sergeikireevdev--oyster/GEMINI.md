## Bundled pi extensions

This repo ships the pi extensions that power its features in `extensions/`:

| File | Tool / command | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `extensions/file-explorer.ts` | `/files` command + `ctrl+o` shortcut | Browse the workspace from the TUI, then edit or download any file. |
| `extensions/hublot.ts` | `hublot` tool | Open/close/list public Cloudflare tunnels to caller-provided local ports. |
| `extensions/loop.ts` | `/loop` command + `loop` tool | Execute Markdown checklist items sequentially in isolated subagents, advancing only after an executable validation script passes. |
| `extensions/pinned-widget.ts` | `pinned_widget` tool | Pin/list/group private files, media, Markdown, directories, and HTTPS links in the right sidebar. |
| `extensions/routine.ts` | `routine` tool | Create/start/stop/teardown session-bound scripts with live progress reporting. |
| `extensions/sudo.ts` | `bash` permission gate | Prompt through Oyster for a masked sudo password before a permissioned command executes. |

pi loads extensions from `~/.pi/agent/extensions/`. To make these bundled files
available (and keep them in sync with the repo), symlink or copy them:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.pi/agent/extensions
ln -sf "$(pwd)"/extensions/*.ts ~/.pi/agent/extensions/   # symlink — edits here apply immediately
# or:
# cp extensions/*.ts ~/.pi/agent/extensions/              # copy — stable snapshot
```

Restart pi afterwards. When developing an extension through Oyster, stop and restart every affected session runner after changing the extension; existing pi RPC sessions keep their originally loaded extension code. Sending `/reload` from Oyster does not reload an RPC session because `/reload` is handled only by pi's interactive mode, and refreshing the browser is also insufficient.

## Built-in MCP endpoint (Claude Code and other MCP harnesses)

pi has no MCP client, so the extensions above stay the pi integration. For MCP-capable harnesses, the Oyster server itself serves the same tools over MCP (Streamable HTTP, stateless) at `POST /mcp` — `hublot`, `pinned_widget`, `group_pinned_widgets`, `routine` — plus a `bash` tool whose `sudo=true` option mirrors `extensions/sudo.ts`: the complete command runs as root after Oyster's masked password dialog, brokered through `POST /runner/ui-request` to the runner's browser. The implementation lives in `server/http/routes/mcpRoutes.mjs`; its tools call the regular route handlers in-process through `server/http/internalDispatch.mjs`, so there is no second copy of the widget, tunnel, or routine logic and no loopback HTTP.

Every request carries its caller: `POST /mcp?runner=<id>&session=<id>&workdir=<abs path>` with the usual bearer token. The Claude Code driver builds that URL per launch and passes it with `--mcp-config` as an `http` server, using the header `Authorization: Bearer ${OYSTER_TOKEN}`, which Claude Code expands from the inherited environment so the token never appears on a command line. It also allows every `mcp__oyster` tool. Nothing has to be registered in Claude Code's settings, and other MCP clients can use the same URL.

Driver modules such as `server/runner-drivers/claude-code.mjs` are reached only through static imports, which the hot reloader does not cache-bust, so restart the Oyster service (not just the runner) after changing them. When changing a tool, update both the pi extension and the MCP endpoint. Verify with `node --test tests/mcp-routes.test.mjs`.

Pinned files remain private and open through authenticated native Markdown, image, and video displays; use a hublot only for a public live interface. Opening a hublot requires a local `port` (1–65535), with an optional `description` label. Provision the service separately: hublot starts only cloudflared and persists its SQLite entry; closing the tunnel leaves the local service running. The `hublot` and `routine` tools discover the UI server
from `OYSTER_URL` (default `http://127.0.0.1:8080`) and authenticate with
`OYSTER_TOKEN` or the project-root `.ui-token` file.

## Installation

Oyster and its bundled pi submodule use separate lockfiles. Install and build both explicitly; do not run an unscoped workspace install across them.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js ≥ 22.19** — check with `node --version`. This is required universally because the stable server uses the built-in `node:sqlite` application store, even when pi sessions use JSONL.
- **`pi` source submodule** — initialize `pi/` and build its coding-agent CLI. `PI_BIN` can still select another compatible executable.
- **`cloudflared`** (optional) — only needed for the tunnels feature. Install from [pkg.cloudflare.com](https://pkg.cloudflare.com) if you plan to use tunnel functionality.
- **FFmpeg** (optional outside containers) — converts pinned AVI, MOV, MKV, and M4V videos to cached browser-compatible MP4 playback. Container images and `scripts/install.sh` include it.

### Quick start

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules <repo-url> oyster && cd oyster
npm ci
npm ci --prefix pi --ignore-scripts
npm run build:pi
npm run build
node server/server.mjs
```

The server starts on `0.0.0.0:8080` and prints a random auth token to the console. On first run it also writes that token to `.ui-token` (git-ignored) so subsequent restarts keep the same token.

Open `http://<host>:8080/#token=<TOKEN>` in your browser. The URL fragment also gets passed as your bearer token for API calls.

### Configuration

| Flag | Env | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--port` | `PORT` | `8080` | listen port |
| `--host` | `HOST` | `0.0.0.0` | bind address |
| `--token` | `OYSTER_TOKEN` | `.ui-token` file, else random | auth token |
| `--unauthenticated` | `OYSTER_UNAUTHENTICATED` | off | disable Oyster token auth behind an authenticated outer proxy |
| `--dir` | `PI_DIR` | cwd | working directory pi runs in |
| `--pi` | `PI_BIN` | `pi/packages/coding-agent/dist/cli.js` | pi executable path |
| `--pi-args "…"` | `PI_ARGS` | – | extra args appended to `pi --mode rpc` |
| – | `OYSTER_DB_PATH` | `~/.pi/agent/oyster.sqlite` | separate SQLite database for oyster-owned application data |
| `--tunnel-bin` | `TUNNEL_BIN` | `cloudflared` | binary for opening tunnels |

### Running as a service

A systemd user unit is provided as `oyster.service`: it auto-restarts on crash and starts on login. Before using it, update the hardcoded `WorkingDirectory=` and `ExecStart=` paths to match your clone location:

```bash
sed "s|__OYSTER_DIR__|$(pwd)|g" oyster.service > ~/.config/systemd/user/oyster.service
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now oyster.service
sudo loginctl enable-linger $USER   # keep running without an active login session
```

Logs: `journalctl --user -u oyster -f`.

For a backgrounded foreground process instead:

```bash
nohup node server/server.mjs > /tmp/oyster.log 2>&1 &
```

## Run the tests after every feature or fix

After implementing a feature or fixing a bug, run:

```sh
npm test
```

and make sure **all** tests pass before you consider the work done.

When a unit of work is finished, run the complete validation suite:

```sh
./scripts/run-e2e-tests.sh
```

After validation passes, rebuild the UI before committing:

```sh
npm run build
```

Commit the completed changes only after the unit tests, end-to-end tests, and
UI rebuild all succeed, then start the next unit of work.

## Align remote branches with `origin/main`

Before pushing a branch for review or merge, fetch the remote and rebase the branch onto the current `origin/main`. Verify that `git merge-base HEAD origin/main` equals `git rev-parse origin/main`; do not push a parallel history containing patch-equivalent copies of commits already on `origin/main`. If an already-published branch must be rebased, update it with `git push --force-with-lease`, never an unrestricted force push.

Why this is non-negotiable in this repo: the server hot-reloads `server/app.mjs` and
`public/index.html` **the moment you save them** — every edit deploys
instantly to live browser sessions. There is no build step or review gate to
catch mistakes. A single stale reference in the UI's inline script (e.g. a
top-level `$("removedElement").addEventListener(...)`) aborts the whole
script and takes down the page for everyone connected.

The suite is fast (<1s). It includes guards that specifically catch
hot-reload footguns:

- `tests/ui-page.test.mjs` — the inline script must parse, and every DOM id
  it references must exist in the markup. If you remove or rename an element
  in `index.html`, remove or update the code that references it.
- `tests/sessions.test.mjs`, `tests/checkpoints.test.mjs` — server-side
  behavior.

When you add a feature, prefer adding a test alongside it — especially for
anything in `server/app.mjs` request handling, where a regression silently breaks
remote clients.

## Editing `public/index.html`

- The whole UI is one file with one inline `<script>`. Top-level statements
  run at load; if any of them throw, the page is dead. Guard optional
  elements (`$("x")?.addEventListener(...)`) or wire listeners inside the
  code that creates the element.
- Saving the file broadcasts `ui_reload` to connected browsers, which may
  refresh immediately. Don't save half-finished states; make edits atomic.

## Editing `server/app.mjs`

- Hot-reloaded via `init(state)`. All state that must survive a reload
  (runners, SSE clients, buffers, tunnels) lives on the host-owned `state`
  object from `server/server.mjs` — never in module-level variables.
- If a reload fails to parse, the server keeps the previous version running
  and broadcasts `code_reload_failed`; check the journal
  (`journalctl --user -u oyster`) if your change doesn't seem to apply.
