This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with
code in this repository.

## Project Overview

pg_textsearch is a Postgres extension providing full-text search with BM25
ranking. (Internal name: Tapir) It implements a memtable-based architecture
similar to LSM trees, with in-memory structures that spill to disk segments
for scalability.

**Current Version**: 1.2.0-dev

**Postgres Version Support**: 17, 18 (tested in CI)

**Schema Organization**: Currently uses public schema. Future versions may
consider a dedicated `pg_textsearch` schema for cleaner namespace management.

## Important Notes for Development

- **pg_textsearch requires shared_preload_libraries** - Add `pg_textsearch`
  to `shared_preload_libraries` in postgresql.conf and restart the server
  before CREATE EXTENSION. A server restart is also required after updating
  the binary (e.g., after `make install` during development).

- **Every test failure matters.** We keep CI green on main. Do not
  dismiss failures as "pre-existing" — they almost never are. If a
  test fails, investigate and fix the root cause. If you believe a
  failure is unrelated to your changes, verify by checking out main
  and running the same test. Even if it does reproduce on main, it
  still needs to be investigated and fixed, not ignored.

## Core Architecture

### Storage Architecture

The index uses a hybrid storage approach:
- **Memtable**: In-memory inverted index with term dictionary and posting
  lists, stored in shared memory for concurrent access
- **Segments**: Immutable disk-based structures using V2 block storage format
  with skip lists for efficient top-k queries

### Query Optimization

- **Block-Max WAND (BMW)**: Top-k query optimization that uses block-level
  upper bounds to skip non-contributing blocks
- **Skip Lists**: Segment format includes skip entries for fast block seeking

### Source Code Structure

The `src/` directory is organized in layers (see CONTRIBUTING.md for
details):

- **Layer 1 (Postgres interface):** `access/` (AM handler, build,
  scan, vacuum), `types/` (bm25query, bm25vector), `planner/`
  (optimizer hooks, cost estimation)
- **Layer 2 (Index coordination):** `scoring/` (BM25, Block-Max
  WAND), `index/` (state lifecycle, registry, metapage, posting
  source abstraction)
- **Layer 3 (Storage):** `memtable/` (in-memory inverted index),
  `segment/` (on-disk segments, merge, compression)
- **Cross-cutting:** `debug/` (dump utilities), `mod.c` (init)

### Data Types

- `bm25vector` - Stores term frequencies with index context for BM25 scoring
  - Format: `"index_name:{lexeme1:freq1,lexeme2:freq2,...}"`
- `bm25query` - Represents queries for BM25 scoring with optional index context
  - Format: `"query terms"` or `"index_name:{query terms}"` (via to_bm25query)

## Test Structure

  storage/segments, query optimization (bmw, wand), table features
  (partitioned, inheritance), and edge cases
- **Shell tests** (`test/scripts/`): concurrency.sh, recovery.sh, segment.sh,
  stress.sh for multi-session, crash recovery, and load testing
- **Expected output** (`test/expected/`): Reference outputs for regression tests

## BM25 Implementation

### Query Processing

- `text <@> bm25query` - primary operator, works in index scans and standalone
- `text <@> text` - implicit form, planner rewrites to `text <@> bm25query`
- Returns negative BM25 scores for Postgres ASC ordering
- bm25query with index name required for WHERE clause queries

### Query Style Guidelines

**Do not use WHERE clauses that compare against BM25 scores** as a
generic way to filter for matching documents. Numeric score
comparisons like `WHERE content <@> query < 0` are an anti-pattern
when used as a convenience filter in tests and examples:

- BM25 scores are for ranking, not filtering; their numeric values are
  opaque and not meaningful to compare against thresholds
- A WHERE clause with `<@>` triggers standalone scoring (sequential
  scan), not an index scan; index scans require ORDER BY
- The correct pattern is `ORDER BY content <@> query LIMIT n`

For counting matching documents, use a subquery with ORDER BY:
```sql
-- WRONG: standalone scoring as a convenience filter
SELECT count(*) FROM docs
WHERE content <@> to_bm25query('term', 'idx') < 0;

-- RIGHT: index scan via ORDER BY
SELECT count(*) FROM (
    SELECT 1 FROM docs
    ORDER BY content <@> to_bm25query('term', 'idx')
) sub;
```

**Exception: standalone scoring as an explicit test target.** Tests
that deliberately exercise the standalone scoring code path (e.g.,
comparing index scan results against standalone results) should use
WHERE with `<@>` and document the intent. See `validation.sql`
(`validate_index_vs_standalone`), `queries.sql`, and `vector.sql`
for examples of this pattern.

### Block-Max WAND Optimization

Top-k queries use Block-Max WAND optimization:
- Block-level upper bounds computed during index build
- Early termination when blocks cannot contribute to results
- Skip lists for fast block seeking in segments

### VACUUM and Alive Bitset

VACUUM uses per-segment alive bitsets (1 bit per doc) to mark dead
documents instead of rebuilding segments. This is O(dead_docs) instead
of O(all_docs). Dead docs are filtered during BMW scoring and
physically removed during segment merge.

**Stale statistics after VACUUM**: After VACUUM marks docs dead, the
segment's `total_docs`, `total_tokens`, and per-term `doc_freq` are
not updated. This means BM25 IDF calculations use slightly stale
corpus statistics until the next segment merge/compaction, which
corrects them. For small numbers of deletes this is negligible; mass
deletion can affect ranking quality until the next merge.

  dictionary, posting lists, and document entries
- `bm25_dump_index(index_name, filepath)` - Dumps full index to file
- `bm25_summarize_index(index_name)` - Shows high-level index statistics
- `bm25_spill_index(index_name)` - Forces memtable spill to disk segment,
  returns number of entries spilled
- `bm25_debug_pageviz(index_name, file_path)` - Generate page layout visualization

## Parallel Index Build

Parallel index build uses multiple workers to speed up CREATE INDEX on large
tables.

### Requirements

- Table must have >= 100,000 estimated rows (configurable via
  `TP_MIN_PARALLEL_TUPLES`)
- `max_parallel_maintenance_workers` must be > 0
- Workers are automatically allocated based on table statistics

### How It Works

1. Leader launches parallel workers and assigns heap block ranges
2. Workers scan their assigned blocks, tokenize documents, and build
   local in-memory indexes
3. Workers write intermediate segment data to temporary BufFiles
4. Leader performs an N-way merge of all worker BufFiles, writing the
   final merged segment directly to index pages
5. Result is a single merged segment

### Configuration

| GUC | Description | Default |
|-----|-------------|---------|
| `max_parallel_maintenance_workers` | Max workers for parallel operations | 2 |

### Limitations

- Postgres may launch fewer workers than requested for smaller tables

## Important Notes

### Concurrency Safety

- All shared memory structures protected by appropriate locks
- String interning is thread-safe via hash table locks
- Transaction isolation maintained through proper cleanup

### Testing Requirements

- Always run `make installcheck` before committing changes
- Concurrency tests verify thread safety under load
- Shell tests verify crash recovery and multi-backend behavior

### Code Style

- Uses clang-format for consistent C formatting
- Postgres coding conventions followed
- Memory allocation patterns follow Postgres standards
- Wrap all lines at 79 characters
- A memtable is stored in shared memory, but there is one memtable per index.
  Memtables are not shared across indexes, only across backend processes via
  shared memory.
- Postgres is installed at ~/pgsql

### Pre-Commit Checklist

**ALWAYS complete these steps before committing changes:**
1. `make` - Compile the extension
2. `make installcheck` - Run all tests
3. **Check test/regression.diffs** - Examine diffs to ensure your changes
   didn't introduce failures
4. If you modified error messages, update corresponding test/expected/*.out
5. `make format-check` - Verify code formatting
6. Re-run `make installcheck` after fixing any test expectation files

### Git Workflow

- **After PRs are merged**: Always check if main has been updated, even if you
  didn't do the merge yourself. Run `git fetch && git rebase origin/main` on
  active branches to avoid merge conflicts.
- **Before pushing**: Verify your branch is up-to-date with main to prevent
  conflicts from divergent histories.
