# Rule: Continuous Testing and Error Monitoring

## Requirements

1. **All tests must be runnable via `pytest tests/`**
   - Ensure pytest compatibility for all test files
   - Use pytest fixtures and conventions
   - Maintain Django test compatibility where needed

2. **Tests must add their output to `tests.log`**
   - Configure pytest logging to write to `tests.log`
   - Include detailed test results, errors, and timing
   - Preserve log history for analysis

3. **Run tests continuously**
   - Monitor file changes and auto-run tests for the new and/or affected scenarios
   - Use watch mode or interval-based execution
   - Provide real-time feedback on test status

4. **Monitor and fix errors automatically**
   - Parse test output and `tests.log` for failures
   - Identify root causes of test failures
   - Implement fixes proactively
   - Re-run tests to validate fixes

## Implementation

### Pytest Configuration
- Configure `pytest.ini` or `pyproject.toml` for logging
- Set up proper test discovery patterns
- Configure Django settings for pytest

### Continuous Monitoring
- Use file watchers (e.g., `pytest-watch`, `entr`)
- Parse test results in real-time
- Log analysis for error patterns

### Error Fixing Protocol
- Categorize errors (syntax, logic, dependency, etc.)
- Apply appropriate fixes based on error type
- Formulate the target state (what should be the result of the fix)
- Inform user that you found the error, how you see target state, and what you are going to do to fix it
- Apply the fix
- Validate fixes with immediate test re-run
- Update tests if requirements have changed

## Usage

When working on any codebase:
1. Ensure pytest setup is complete
2. Check background processes. If there is no continuous_test_runner.py - start it
3. Do continuous test output monitoring
3. Also monitor `tests.log` for issues
4. Fix errors as they are detected
5. Maintain test health continuously
