# Agent Instructions

## Memory: Hindsight bank

This repo uses the `hindsight-memory` skill. Project memory lives in the
Hindsight bank named in `.bank` (do not edit by hand).

- Recall against the project bank AND `coding-knowledge` at the start of
  relevant tasks (parallel calls).
- Retain learnings as atomic, self-contained, clear memories tagged
  `user`/`feedback`/`project`/`reference`.
- Cross-project rules go in `coding-knowledge` as memories tagged
  `coding-rule` (not as directives — directives are not recallable).
- Use `retain` (async); avoid `sync_retain` in normal flow (it blocks).
- Manual ops: `/hindsight-memory-operations` (subcommands: `bootstrap`,
  `migrate [path]`, `status`, `disable`, `enable`, `forget <query>`).
- Never touch banks not prefixed with `coding-`.
- Disable per-repo: `/hindsight-memory-operations disable` or add
  `enabled: false` to `.bank`.
- Disable globally: `HINDSIGHT_MEMORY=off` or remove
  `~/.claude/hindsight-memory.enabled`.

## Project Management with Mycelium

This project uses [Mycelium](https://github.com/tcsenpai/mycelium) (`myc`) for task and epic management.

### Quick Reference

```bash
# Initialize mycelium in this project (creates .mycelium/ directory)
myc init

# Create an epic (a large body of work)
myc epic create --title "Feature X" --description "Build feature X"

# Create tasks within an epic
myc task create --title "Implement Y" --description "Build the implementation for Y" --epic 1 --priority high --due 2025-12-31

# Task priorities: low, medium, high, critical
# Task status: open, in_progress, closed
# Mark a task as in progress (there is no `task start`; use update):
myc task update 1 --status in_progress

# List tasks. `myc list` (top-level) shows a TREE with dependencies and epic
# grouping — use it to see the overall state. `myc task list` is a flat list.
myc list
myc task list
myc task list --epic 1
myc task list --overdue
myc task list --blocked
myc task list --all          # include closed tasks

# Manage dependencies (task 1 blocks task 2)
myc task link blocks --task 1 2
myc deps show 2

# Close tasks (blocked tasks cannot be closed without --force)
myc task close 1

# Assign tasks
myc assignee create --name "Alice" --github "alice"
myc task assign 1 1

# Link to external resources
myc task link github-issue --task 1 "owner/repo#123"
myc task link github-pr --task 1 "owner/repo#456"
myc task link url --task 1 "https://example.com"

# Project overview
myc summary

# Export data
myc export json
myc export csv
```

### Data Model

- **Epic**: A large body of work with a title and optional description (e.g., a feature or milestone)
- **Task**: A unit of work with a title and optional description, optionally linked to an epic
- **Dependency**: Task A blocks Task B (B cannot close until A is closed)
- **Assignee**: Person assigned to a task (can have GitHub username)
- **External Ref**: Link to GitHub issues/PRs or URLs

### ID Prefixes (v5)

Each entity has its **own** integer sequence, so a bare number is ambiguous
across categories. Mycelium now **displays** IDs with a one-letter category
prefix so they can't be confused:

| Category | Prefix | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Epic | `E` | `E3` |
| Task | `T` | `T3` |
| Follow-up | `F` | `F3` |
| Assignee | `A` | `A3` |
| External ref | `R` | `R3` |

**Input is backward compatible.** Every command still accepts a bare integer
(`myc task show 3`) *and* the prefixed form (`myc task show T3`,
case-insensitive). Passing the **wrong** category prefix is a hard error with a
hint — e.g. `myc task show E3` tells you `E3` is an epic and suggests
`myc epic show E3`. This catches copy/paste mix-ups.

`--format json` output is unchanged: the `id` field stays a raw integer, so
existing scripts and the Linear sync keep working.

### Git Tracking

The `.mycelium/` directory contains the SQLite database and should be committed to git:

```bash
git add .mycelium/
git commit -m "Add mycelium project tracking"
```

### Follow-up Stop hook (Claude Code)

`myc init` installs a project-local Claude Code Stop hook into `.claude/`
(script + `settings.json` wiring) that enforces the end-of-task follow-up
check automatically. Commit `.claude/` so the whole team gets it.

```bash
myc init --no-hooks          # skip the hook install
myc hooks install            # (re)install into the project's .claude/
myc hooks install --global   # install into ~/.claude instead
myc hooks uninstall          # remove (add --global for ~/.claude)
myc hooks status             # show where it's installed
```

The hook self-dedups, so a global and a local copy can coexist without
firing the check twice.

### Updating

```bash
myc update   # cargo install --force, then resync AGENTS.md + hook to the new version
```

`myc update` updates the binary via cargo, then re-runs `prime-agents --force`
and `hooks install` so this project's AGENTS.md and hook match the new version.
If cargo isn't available it skips the binary step and just resyncs the
artifacts (update the binary by hand, then rerun).

### Follow-ups (`myc followup`, alias `myc fu`)

Lightweight scratch table for non-blocking "oh-by-the-way" items
captured mid-work — bugs, questions, ideas, things the user should look
at later. **Separate from tasks** (no epic/priority/deps/assignee). Most
follow-ups are resolved by the user, not the agent.

```bash
myc followup add "body text"                # capture (body required)
myc followup add "body text" --title "tag"  # optional short title
myc fu add "short form alias works too"

myc followup list                           # all (default)
myc followup list -o                        # only active (open + in_progress)
myc followup list -c                        # only closed (done + wontfix)
myc followup list --status done             # exact status

myc followup show <id>                      # full detail
myc followup next                           # lowest-ID active (agent loop)
myc followup count                          # JSON: {open, in_progress, done, wontfix}

myc followup start <id>                     # → in_progress
myc followup done <id> [--reason "..."]     # → done
myc followup wontfix <id> [--reason "..."]  # → wontfix
myc followup reopen <id>                    # → open

myc followup edit <id> --body "new body" [--title -|"new title"]
myc followup append <id> "more context"     # timestamped, preserves existing
myc followup rm <id> [--force]
myc followup promote <id> [--epic N] [--priority high]  # convert to task
```

**Agent rule — end-of-task follow-up check** (MANDATORY)

At the end of every mycelium-tracked unit of work (closing a task,
finishing a user-requested change that touched myc state), the agent
MUST:

1. Run `myc followup list --format json` (or `myc followup count
   --format json`).
2. If `open > 0`, surface those to the user before wrapping:
   > "Before we wrap — N open follow-up(s): [titles/bodies]. Want me to
   > handle any now, or leave for later?"
   Count only `open`, not `active`: `in_progress` items are already
   being worked and don't need an end-of-task decision.
3. **Never silently process them.** Always ask.

`myc task close` itself also prints a one-line reminder (only for open
follow-ups older than ~60s; fresh or in_progress ones stay silent), but
the agent should still proactively check.

Use `myc followup add` during work to capture anything you notice but
shouldn't act on right now.

### For AI Agents

When working on this project:

1. At the START of a task, reconstruct state instead of relying on memory:
   `myc list` (tree with dependencies) and `myc followup list -o` (open items).
2. Check blocked tasks: `myc task list --blocked`
3. Create tasks for new work: `myc task create --title "..." --description "..." --epic N`
4. Mark a task in progress while you work on it: `myc task update N --status in_progress`
5. Capture incidental observations as follow-ups: `myc followup add "..."`
6. At end of task: `myc followup list` and surface open ones to the user
7. Mark tasks complete when done: `myc task close N`
8. Use `--format json` for machine-readable output: `myc task list --format json`

## Mental Frameworks for Mycelium Usage

### 1. INVEST — Task Quality Gate

Before creating or updating any task, validate it against these criteria.
A task that fails more than one is not ready to be written.

| Criterion | Rule |
|---|---|
| **Independent** | Can be completed without unblocking other tasks first |
| **Negotiable** | The *what* is fixed; the *how* remains open |
| **Valuable** | Produces a verifiable, concrete outcome |
| **Estimable** | If you cannot size it, it is too vague or too large |
| **Small** | If it spans more than one work cycle, split it |
| **Testable** | Has an explicit, binary done condition |

> If a task fails **Estimable** or **Testable**, convert it to an Epic and decompose.

---

### 2. DAG — Dependency Graph Thinking

Before scheduling or prioritizing, model the implicit dependency graph.

**Rules:**
- No task moves to `in_progress` if it has an unresolved upstream blocker
- Priority is a function of both urgency **and fan-out** (how many tasks does completing this one unlock?)
- Always work the **critical path** first — not the task that feels most urgent

**Prioritization heuristic:**
```
score = urgency + (blocked_tasks_count × 1.5)
```

When creating a task, explicitly ask: *"What does this block, and what blocks this?"*
Set dependency links in Mycelium before touching status.

---

### 3. Principle of Minimal Surprise (PMS)

Mycelium's state must remain predictable and auditable at all times.

**Rules:**
- **Prefer idempotent operations** — update before you create; never duplicate
- **Check before write** — search for an equivalent item before creating a new one
- **Always annotate mutations** — every status change, priority shift, or reassignment must carry an explicit `reason` field
- **No orphan tasks** — every task must be linked to an Epic; every Epic to a strategic goal
- Deletions are a last resort; prefer `cancelled` status with a reason

> The state of Mycelium after any operation must be explainable to another agent with zero context.

## Graft — repo context graph

This repo is indexed in `graft/`: small linked markdown nodes that explain each
system and carry exact file:line spans, kept in sync with the code through git.

For ANY task here — understanding how something works, finding where code lives,
or scoping a change — get context from the graph before grepping or opening
source files. Re-ask freely (it's cheap) and reuse literal identifiers you
already have (symbol, error string, file name) as the query. New to this repo?
Run `graft map` first — a token-budgeted orientation (dir clusters, hubs,
hotspots), no LLM, no key.

- Run `graft ask "<your question>" --source` → ranked nodes with the relevant
  code spans inlined (each hit's ≤8-line crux by default; `--full` for whole
  definitions when the crux isn't enough). Match the tool to the task shape:
  for understanding or editing, the top node IS the answer — cite its
  `covers:` file:line spans and edit straight from `--source`. For
  exhaustive tasks ("every occurrence / every caller of this pattern"), ranked
  results are top-N, not complete — run `graft grep "<literal>"` instead
  (exhaustive over indexed files, grouped by enclosing symbol), falling back
  to raw `grep -rn` only for unindexed files.
- `graft skeleton <file>` → every definition's signature + span, ~10× cheaper
  than reading the file; use it to skim an API surface.
- `graft callers <symbol>` gives precomputed, exact edges — who calls this.
  Add `--direction out` for what it calls, or `--depth N` to walk
  transitively for the full blast radius. For structural questions, skip
  ranking and use this directly.
- Or browse: `graft/INDEX.md` lists every node; follow the links.
- Monorepos and folders of multiple repos rank fairly across sub-projects —
  hits carry `[scope/]` labels naming which one they're from. Narrow with
  `graft ask "<task>" --in <scope>/` once you know where you're working.

If a returned span is truncated ("+N more lines"), open the file at that exact
range before finalizing. Only open source files when a node genuinely lacks a
needed detail, and then at the exact file:line the node points to — never
re-read whole files.

After big code changes, refresh the graph with `graft build` (deterministic,
no API key, $0).
