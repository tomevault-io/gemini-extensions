# MCP Integration Guidelines

## Template Context

This is a boilerplate template repository. When using this template:

1. **Repository Initialization**: After creating from template, run `./scripts/init-template.sh` to replace all `{{REPO_NAME}}`, `{{GITHUB_USER}}`, and `{{REPO_PATH}}` placeholders.

2. **MCP Server Setup**: Copy `.mcp.example.json` to `claude.json` and configure:
   - kit-dev for codebase intelligence
   - Ref for documentation research
   - Linear for ticket management (optional)

3. **Thoughts Submodule**: Create a separate repository for your project's thoughts and add as submodule, or remove thoughts references if not needed.

This project uses Kit MCP (codebase intelligence), Ref MCP (documentation research), and Linear MCP (ticket management) to enhance code analysis and development workflow.

## Tool Selection Decision Tree

### For Local Codebase Work

**Use Kit MCP when:**
- Finding symbol definitions → `extract_symbols`
- Understanding code structure → `get_file_tree`, `extract_symbols`
- Tracing symbol usage → `find_symbol_usages`
- Tracing dependencies manually → `extract_symbols` + `find_symbol_usages`
- Searching code patterns → `grep_code` (literal) or `search_code` (pattern)

**Use built-in tools when:**
- Reading specific files → `Read` (faster, complete content)
- Searching non-code files → `Grep` (configs, markdown, JSON)
- File path patterns → `Glob` (finding files by name)
- One-off searches → `Grep` (no caching benefit from Kit MCP)

**Note:** Kit MCP tools work best with Python and TypeScript. For other languages (Go, Rust, etc.), built-in tools may be more reliable.

### For External Documentation

**Use Ref MCP when:**
- Researching APIs → `ref_search_documentation`
- Reading documentation → `ref_read_url`
- Finding integration guides → `ref_search_documentation`
- Debugging third-party packages → `ref_search_documentation`

**Use WebSearch when:**
- Current events or news (post-January 2025)
- Real-time data
- General information (non-technical)
- Documentation not in Ref's curated index

**Use WebFetch when:**
- Reading specific URLs not available via Ref MCP
- Fetching content from blogs, tutorials, or non-official sources

### For Linear Ticket Management

**Use Linear MCP when:**
- Reading ticket details → `linear-ticket-reader` agent
- Searching for related tickets → `linear-searcher` agent
- Updating ticket status or comments → Via `/linear` command
- Getting ticket context for implementation → `linear-ticket-reader` agent

**Use `/linear` command directly when:**
- Creating tickets from thoughts documents
- Adding comments with conversation context
- Manually updating ticket fields
- Managing ticket workflow progression

## Repository Initialization

At the start of codebase work:
1. `open_repository` to load context (enables Kit MCP caching)
2. `get_file_tree` to understand structure (Git-aware, respects .gitignore)
3. `extract_symbols` for fast symbol overview (results are cached)
4. Then proceed with focused analysis using appropriate tools

**Important:** Repository IDs (e.g., `repo_0`) reset between Claude Code sessions. Re-initialize when starting a new session.

## Large Repository Handling

### Known Limitation: Subdirectory .gitignore Support

Kit-dev's `get_file_tree` currently only loads the root `.gitignore` file. Repositories with subdirectory `.gitignore` files (common in monorepos) may return excessive file counts.

**Symptoms:**
- Token overflow errors (>25k tokens)
- File count much higher than `git ls-files`
- Includes node_modules, venv, or other ignored directories

**Workaround**: Use targeted tools instead of full tree:

```bash
# Instead of get_file_tree:
Glob("**/*.py")           # Find Python files
Grep("pattern", type="ts") # Search TypeScript
LS specific/directory/     # List specific paths
```

**When to use get_file_tree**:
- Small repos (<1000 files)
- Repos with complete root .gitignore
- After verifying file count with: `git ls-files | wc -l`

**When to use alternatives**:
- Large repos (>5000 files)
- Monorepos with multiple node_modules
- Repos with subdirectory .gitignore files

**Fix Status**: Upstream fix in progress (see `thoughts/shared/plans/2025-10-05-SOL-1-kit-mcp-gitignore-fix.md`)

## Agent Usage

Commands will automatically use MCP-enhanced agents when available:

- **`codebase-locator`**: Locates files and components using Grep/Glob/LS + Kit MCP AST tools
  - Use when: Finding where features are implemented, locating specific code

- **`codebase-analyzer`**: Analyzes implementation details using Read + Kit MCP symbol/dependency tools
  - Use when: Understanding how something works, analyzing code structure

- **`codebase-pattern-finder`**: Finds similar implementations using Grep/Read + Kit MCP pattern tools
  - Use when: Looking for examples, finding existing patterns to follow

- **`external-doc-researcher`**: Researches external documentation using Ref MCP + WebSearch
  - Use when: Researching frameworks, APIs, best practices from official docs

- **`mcp-package-researcher`**: Deep package research using Ref MCP (docs) + Kit MCP package search (source)
  - Use when: Planning package integration, debugging third-party libraries, evaluating packages

- **`codebase-dependency-tracer`**: Maps dependency relationships through manual import tracing
  - Use when: Understanding module boundaries, tracing import chains
  - Note: Manual aggregation using extract_symbols + find_symbol_usages
  - For automated graphs: See thoughts/shared/research/dependency-analysis-options.md

- **`linear-ticket-reader`**: Reads Linear ticket details using Linear MCP
  - Use when: User mentions ticket ID, creating plans from tickets, understanding ticket context
  - Returns: Full ticket details including description, status, comments, links

- **`linear-searcher`**: Searches Linear tickets using Linear MCP
  - Use when: Finding similar issues, searching by status/label, historical context gathering
  - Returns: Organized ticket list grouped by status, priority, or date

## Graceful Degradation

All workflows work with or without MCP:
- **If MCP available:** Enhanced AST awareness, token efficiency, cached symbol extraction
- **If MCP unavailable:** Traditional Grep/Read/Glob tools work as fallback
- **No workflow changes:** Agents automatically choose best available tools

## Error Reporting and Unusual Behaviors

All agents include self-reporting mechanisms to provide visibility into tool usage and issues:

### Search Method Used (Mandatory)
Every agent output includes a "Search Method Used" section reporting:
- Which tools were actually used
- Why those tools were chosen
- Implicit indication of fallback decisions

### Unusual Behaviors Encountered (Optional)
Agents report unusual behaviors when they occur:

**Reported conditions:**
- MCP tool failures (connection errors, timeouts)
- Empty results when data was expected
- Fallback from primary tool to degraded functionality
- Performance issues (slow responses, timeouts)
- Data inconsistencies or validation failures

**Report format:**
- **Tool**: Which tool encountered the issue
- **Issue**: What went wrong
- **Resolution**: What fallback or alternative was used
- **Impact**: Agent-determined assessment (Minimal/Moderate/Severe)

**When main agents encounter unusual behavior reports:**
- Minimal impact: Noted in synthesis, no action needed
- Moderate/Severe impact: Warning indicator (⚠️) + suggestion to create Linear ticket for investigation

**Example from agent output:**
```markdown
### Unusual Behaviors Encountered

**Tool**: `mcp__kit-dev__grep_ast`
**Issue**: Repository not initialized - repo_id was null
**Resolution**: Fell back to traditional Grep tool
**Impact**: Minimal - Results less precise but all relevant files found
```

This text-based self-reporting requires no parsing infrastructure - main agents read and comprehend these sections naturally through LLM capabilities.

## Best Practices

1. **Incremental Symbol Extraction:** `extract_symbols` results are cached—use it liberally
2. **Context Before Analysis:** Use `get_file_tree` and `extract_symbols` before diving deep
3. **Research Dependencies:** Use `deep_research_package` before integrating new packages
4. **Verify Findings:** Kit MCP tools may return large result sets—always review and filter
5. **Language Support:** Kit MCP works best with Python/TypeScript; use built-in tools for other languages

## Thoughts Architecture

This repository uses a **Git Submodule** for the thoughts system.

**Structure:**
- `thoughts/` - Git Submodule pointing to https://github.com/{{GITHUB_USER}}/{{REPO_NAME}}-thoughts
- Thoughts have independent version control and commit history
- Main repository only tracks submodule reference (commit hash)

**Benefits:**
- Clean main repository history (thoughts don't clutter commits)
- Better organization and scalability
- No symlinks - full compatibility with Claude Code file tools
- Independent thoughts versioning

**Workflow:**

When creating/updating thoughts documents:
```bash
# Work in thoughts submodule
cd thoughts/
git add shared/research/my-research.md
git commit -m "Add research on topic X"
git push

# Update main repo submodule reference (optional)
cd ..
git add thoughts
git commit -m "Update thoughts reference"
git push
```

When pulling latest thoughts:
```bash
git submodule update --remote thoughts
```

**First-time clone:**
```bash
git clone <repository>
git submodule update --init
```

**Note:** No `humanlayer thoughts sync` commands needed. Thoughts are immediately available after writing to files.

Remember: Better context = Better code suggestions
