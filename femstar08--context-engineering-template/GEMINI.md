> - **Always read `PLANNING.md`** at the start of a new conversation to understand the project's architecture, goals, style, and constraints.

### 🔄 Enhanced Project Awareness & Context Engineering
- **Always read `PLANNING.md`** at the start of a new conversation to understand the project's architecture, goals, style, and constraints.
- **Check `TASK.md`** before starting a new task. If the task isn't listed, add it with a brief description and today's date.
- **Use enhanced Context Engineering system** with failure pattern awareness and validation loops.
- **Use consistent naming conventions, file structure, and architecture patterns** as described in `PLANNING.md`.
- **Use venv_linux** (the virtual environment) whenever executing Python commands, including for unit tests.

### 🧠 Context Engineering Enhanced Rules
- **Always validate PRPs before execution** using `validate-prp` command to catch issues early.
- **Use failure pattern awareness** from the knowledge base to prevent common mistakes.
- **Follow multi-level validation** approach: syntax → unit tests → integration → performance.
- **Run post-implementation analysis** to capture learnings and improve future implementations.
- **Update knowledge base** with new patterns and metrics after each implementation.

### 🧱 Code Structure & Modularity
- **Never create a file longer than 500 lines of code.** If a file approaches this limit, refactor by splitting it into modules or helper files.
- **Organize code into clearly separated modules**, grouped by feature or responsibility.
  For agents this looks like:
    - `agent.py` - Main agent definition and execution logic 
    - `tools.py` - Tool functions used by the agent 
    - `prompts.py` - System prompts
- **Use clear, consistent imports** (prefer relative imports within packages).
- **Use python_dotenv and load_env()** for environment variables.
- **Always implement proper error handling** with specific exception types and meaningful error messages.

### 🧪 Testing & Reliability Enhanced
- **Always create Pytest unit tests for new features** (functions, classes, routes, etc).
- **Follow test-driven development** when implementing complex features.
- **After updating any logic**, check whether existing unit tests need to be updated. If so, do it.
- **Tests should live in a `/tests` folder** mirroring the main app structure.
  - Include at least:
    - 1 test for expected use
    - 1 edge case
    - 1 failure case
    - 1 async context test (if applicable)
- **Use proper test isolation** to prevent test pollution and ensure consistent results.
- **Mock external dependencies** appropriately but avoid over-mocking.

### ⚡ Performance & Quality Standards
- **Always use async/await consistently** - never mix sync and async contexts.
- **Implement proper connection pooling** for database and external API connections.
- **Use connection timeouts** for all external API calls.
- **Implement retry logic with exponential backoff** for transient failures.
- **Monitor memory usage** and implement proper cleanup for long-running processes.
- **Use proper type hints** throughout the codebase for better maintainability.

### 🔧 Validation & Quality Assurance
- **Run ruff check and fix** before committing any code.
- **Run mypy for type checking** and fix all type errors.
- **Run security scanning with bandit** for security vulnerabilities.
- **Ensure test coverage is above 80%** for new features.
- **Use pre-commit hooks** if available to enforce quality standards.

### ✅ Task Completion Enhanced
- **Mark completed tasks in `TASK.md`** immediately after finishing them.
- **Run post-implementation analysis** using `analyze-prp-results` command.
- **Update knowledge base** with any new patterns or gotchas discovered.
- **Add new sub-tasks or TODOs** discovered during development to `TASK.md` under a "Discovered During Work" section.
- **Document any deviations** from the original PRP and reasons for changes.

### 📎 Style & Conventions Enhanced
- **Use Python** as the primary language with modern Python 3.9+ features.
- **Follow PEP8**, use type hints, and format with `ruff` (preferred) or `black`.
- **Use `pydantic` for data validation** and leverage v2 features properly.
- Use `FastAPI` for APIs and `SQLAlchemy` (async) for ORM if applicable.
- **Use proper async patterns** - async/await throughout, proper session management.
- Write **docstrings for every function** using the Google style:
  ```python
  def example():
      """
      Brief summary.

      Args:
          param1 (type): Description.

      Returns:
          type: Description.
          
      Raises:
          ValueError: When invalid input provided.
      """
  ```

### 📚 Documentation & Explainability Enhanced
- **Update `README.md`** when new features are added, dependencies change, or setup steps are modified.
- **Comment non-obvious code** and ensure everything is understandable to a mid-level developer.
- **Document architectural decisions** and include rationale for complex implementations.
- When writing complex logic, **add an inline `# Reason:` comment** explaining the why, not just the what.
- **Keep `.env.example` up to date** with all required environment variables and descriptions.

### 🛡️ Security & Best Practices
- **Never hardcode secrets** - always use environment variables.
- **Validate all input data** using Pydantic models or similar validation.
- **Use proper authentication and authorization** patterns.
- **Implement proper logging** without exposing sensitive information.
- **Use HTTPS for all external API calls** and never disable SSL verification.
- **Implement proper rate limiting** for API endpoints.

### 🧠 AI Behavior Rules Enhanced
- **Never assume missing context. Ask questions if uncertain.**
- **Use the knowledge base** to learn from previous implementations and avoid known pitfalls.
- **Never hallucinate libraries or functions** – only use known, verified Python packages.
- **Always confirm file paths and module names** exist before referencing them in code or tests.
- **Never delete or overwrite existing code** unless explicitly instructed to or if part of a task from `TASK.md`.
- **Follow the enhanced PRP execution process** with proper validation at each step.
- **Learn from failures** and update the knowledge base with new patterns.

### 🔄 Continuous Improvement
- **Analyze each implementation** for patterns and improvements.
- **Share learnings** by updating failure patterns and success metrics.
- **Iterate on templates** based on real-world usage and outcomes.
- **Monitor success rates** and adjust approaches based on data.
- **Celebrate successes** and learn from failures without blame.

### 🚨 Critical Failure Patterns to Avoid
Based on historical data, always be aware of these common failure patterns:

1. **Async Context Mixing** - Never mix sync and async code contexts
2. **Environment Variable Issues** - Always validate config and provide defaults
3. **Import Path Errors** - Verify all imports and dependencies before implementation
4. **Database Session Management** - Use proper async session patterns
5. **API Rate Limiting** - Implement proper retry logic and rate limiting
6. **Pydantic v2 Breaking Changes** - Use correct v2 syntax and imports
7. **Test Isolation Issues** - Ensure proper test cleanup and isolation
8. **JSON Serialization Errors** - Use proper serialization with Pydantic

### 📊 Success Metrics Awareness
Be aware of typical implementation metrics for different feature types:
- **API Integration**: ~35 min, 85% success rate
- **CLI Applications**: ~20 min, 95% success rate  
- **Database Operations**: ~25 min, 92% success rate
- **Web Applications**: ~45 min, 82% success rate
- **Agent Systems**: ~60 min, 75% success rate

Use these as guidelines for complexity assessment and time estimation.

### 🎯 Quality Gates
Before considering any implementation complete:
- [ ] All tests pass with good coverage
- [ ] No linting errors (ruff, mypy, bandit)
- [ ] Code follows project patterns and conventions
- [ ] Documentation is complete and accurate
- [ ] Environment variables documented
- [ ] Error handling is comprehensive
- [ ] Performance meets requirements
- [ ] Security best practices followed
- [ ] Knowledge base updated with learnings

Remember: **The goal is not just working code, but maintainable, reliable, and learnable implementations that improve the entire development process.**
