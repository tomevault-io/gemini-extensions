# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Omniscribe is a desktop application for orchestrating multiple AI coding assistant sessions in parallel. It uses Electron with an embedded NestJS backend in the main process and a React frontend in the renderer.

## Requirements

- Node.js >= 22
- pnpm 10.x

## Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Development (starts web + desktop concurrently)
pnpm dev

# Build all packages (shared must build first — all others depend on it)
pnpm build

# Build only shared package (required before desktop/web/mcp-server builds)
pnpm build:packages

# Lint / Format
pnpm lint
pnpm format          # write
pnpm format:check    # CI check (no write)

# Test / Type-check
pnpm test
pnpm typecheck

# Package desktop app for distribution
pnpm --filter @omniscribe/desktop package

# Platform-specific builds
pnpm package:win    # Windows
pnpm package:mac    # macOS

# Rebuild node-pty after electron update
pnpm --filter @omniscribe/desktop rebuild
```

## Architecture

### Monorepo Structure

- `apps/desktop/` - Electron main process with NestJS backend
- `apps/web/` - React frontend (served by Vite, loaded by Electron renderer)
- `apps/mcp-server/` - MCP server for Claude Code status reporting
- `packages/shared/` - Shared types and utilities

### Backend (NestJS in Electron Main)

Located in `apps/desktop/src/modules/`:

- **TerminalModule** - PTY management via node-pty, handles spawn/input/resize/kill (global module)
- **SessionModule** - AI session lifecycle and state (Starting, Idle, Working, NeedsInput, Done, Error)
- **GitModule** - Git operations (branches, worktrees, commits) via CLI execution with domain services
- **GithubModule** - GitHub CLI operations (PRs, issues, repo info)
- **McpModule** - MCP server discovery, config generation, status polling
- **WorkspaceModule** - Project/tab management, persistence via electron-store
- **QuickActionModule** - Quick action management and execution
- **UsageModule** - Claude CLI usage data fetching
- **HealthModule** - Periodic health checks and zombie session detection
- **SharedModule** - CORS config, env-utils, throttler guard, NestJS logger adapter

Communication uses Socket.io WebSocket for real-time streaming (terminal output, status updates) and Electron IPC for native operations (dialogs, window controls). IPC handlers are modular register/cleanup pairs in `apps/desktop/src/main/ipc/`.

### Frontend (React)

Located in `apps/web/src/`:

- **stores/** - Zustand stores: useSessionStore, useWorkspaceStore, useGitStore, useMcpStore, useQuickActionStore, useTerminalStore, useSettingsStore, useUsageStore, useUpdateStore, useConnectionStore, useSessionHistoryStore, useTaskStore
- **components/** - Organized by domain: `terminal/`, `settings/`, `shared/`, `ui/`, `splash/`
- **hooks/** - Custom hooks for app initialization, session lifecycle, terminal operations, workspace management
- **lib/** - Socket.io client, emit helpers, terminal utilities, theme system, layout calculations

**UI stack:** Radix UI primitives + shadcn/ui pattern, Tailwind CSS, Lucide icons, `cn()` utility for class merging. 40+ CSS themes with runtime switching via CSS custom properties.

**No routing library** — tab-based navigation via workspace store state.

### Shared Package

`packages/shared/src/` contains code shared across all apps:

- **types/** - TypeScript types (session, workspace, mcp, git, github, settings, payloads, usage, updater). The `payloads.ts` file defines typed request/response contracts for all WebSocket events — always reference these types when adding new socket communication.
- **constants/** - Event names (`events.ts`), app constants (`app.ts` — ports, timeouts, directories)
- **logger.ts** - Universal `createLogger()` used by backend, frontend, and MCP server
- **Utilities** - `extractErrorMessage()`, `normalizePath()`, `mapSessionStatus()`, `encodeProjectPath()`

## Key Patterns

### NestJS Module Structure

Each backend module follows: `*.module.ts`, `*.service.ts`, `*.gateway.ts` (WebSocket), `index.ts` (barrel export)

### WebSocket Events

All event names are defined in `packages/shared/src/constants/events.ts` (single source of truth). Events follow the `domain:action` naming convention and cover: Session, Terminal, Git, GitHub, MCP, Workspace, QuickAction, Usage, Zombie, and System domains.

### State Management

Zustand stores in `apps/web/src/stores/` connect to backend via Socket.io. The `createSocketStore.ts` utility provides:

- `SocketStoreSlice` - Common state (isLoading, error, listenersInitialized)
- `createSocketListeners()` - Standardized socket event subscription with automatic cleanup

### Internal Events (Backend Only)

Backend services communicate via EventEmitter2 (dot-notation, e.g. `session.status`, `terminal.output`). These are separate from WebSocket events — defined in `apps/desktop/src/modules/shared/events.ts`. Gateways listen with `@OnEvent()` and broadcast to clients via Socket.io.

### Environment Safety

PTY processes use `buildSafeEnv()` from `apps/desktop/src/modules/shared/env-utils.ts` which applies an allowlist/blocklist to filter environment variables, blocking secrets and code injection vectors.

### Logging

All packages use `createLogger('Name')` from `@omniscribe/shared`. The backend bridges this to NestJS via `NestLoggerAdapter` in `apps/desktop/src/modules/shared/nest-logger.ts`.

### MCP Capabilities

Curated registry of MCP servers Omniscribe ships alongside user-authored entries in `.mcp.json`. Lives in `apps/desktop/src/modules/mcp/capabilities/`. Each capability is an `McpCapability` (id, label, description, optional `preflight`, `buildConfig(ctx) => McpWrittenServerEntry`). Registered in `McpCapabilityRegistryService`. Per-project enabled state lives in `WorkspaceService.projectCapabilities` and is surfaced in Settings → Integrations → AI Capabilities. `McpWriterService` writes a `_omniscribe.managedCapabilities` marker into `.mcp.json` so `removeConfig` can safely strip only capability-owned entries. Adding a capability = one file under `capabilities/` + one `register()` call.

### Dev-only environment flags

- `OMNISCRIBE_ENABLE_CDP=1` — "dogfood mode": exposes Chrome DevTools Protocol on Omniscribe's OWN Electron window (bound to `127.0.0.1:9222`) so you can drive Omniscribe itself from `@playwright/mcp` while developing it. OFF by default, including in unpackaged dev — otherwise Omniscribe would squat on 9222 and block the user's own Electron apps running inside sessions. Never bind beyond `127.0.0.1`.
- `OMNISCRIBE_CDP_PORT` — override the dogfood CDP port (default 9222). Note: the `playwright-electron` MCP capability targets the USER's Electron apps via a per-project port configured in Settings → AI Capabilities — it's independent of this switch.

### Testing

- **Backend:** Jest + `@nestjs/testing` TestingModule. Mock factories in `apps/desktop/test/mocks/` (MockPty, electron-store, child_process).
- **Frontend:** Vitest + jsdom. Store tests in `apps/web/src/stores/__tests__/`. Global mocks in `apps/web/src/test/setup.ts`.
