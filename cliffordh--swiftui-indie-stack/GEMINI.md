# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Koala Starter Kit is a production-ready iOS app template with offline-first architecture. It supports three configuration modes controlled by `AppConfiguration`:

- **Local Mode** (`useFirebase = false`): No Firebase required, device-based identity, UserDefaults storage, local streak tracking
- **Cloud Anonymous Mode** (`useFirebase = true, enableAuth = false`): Firebase backend with anonymous accounts, full Firestore sync, no sign-in UI
- **Cloud Full Auth Mode** (`useFirebase = true, enableAuth = true`): Full Firebase Auth with Apple/Google Sign-In visible in Settings

## Build Commands

```bash
# Build iOS app
xcodebuild -project ios/KoalaStarterKit.xcodeproj -scheme KoalaStarterKit -sdk iphonesimulator build

# Run tests
xcodebuild test -project ios/KoalaStarterKit.xcodeproj -scheme KoalaStarterKit -sdk iphonesimulator -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15'
```

Firebase Functions (when using cloud mode):
```bash
cd firebase-functions/functions
npm install
npm run serve    # Local emulators
npm run deploy   # Deploy to Firebase
npm run logs     # View logs
```

## For AI Assistants

When working on this codebase, follow these guidelines:

### Adding New Features

1. **Follow the canonical pattern** - See `Sources/Library/` for the best example
2. **Use consistent folder structure**:
   ```
   Sources/YourFeature/
   ├── Models/      # Codable structs
   ├── ViewModels/  # ObservableObject classes
   └── Views/       # SwiftUI views
   ```
3. **See ARCHITECTURE.md** for detailed patterns and code templates

### Code Patterns

- **ViewModels**: Use `@Observable` macro with plain properties (iOS 17+). Instance-based ViewModels use `@State` in the owning view; singletons are accessed as plain `var` properties.
- **Singletons**: Use `static let shared` pattern for app-wide state
- **Analytics**: Always add `Analytics.trackScreenView()` in view `.task` modifiers
- **Feature flags**: Check `AppConfiguration` before using optional features

### Conditional Firebase

Always guard Firebase code with both compile-time and runtime checks:

```swift
#if canImport(Firebase)
if AppConfiguration.useFirebase {
    // Firebase-specific code
}
#endif
```

### What NOT to Do

- Don't refactor unrelated code when fixing bugs
- Don't add features beyond what was requested
- Don't change the folder structure without explicit approval
- Don't remove the `#if canImport()` guards

## Architecture

### Key Singletons

| Singleton | Purpose | File |
|-----------|---------|------|
| `AuthManager.shared` | Authentication | `Auth/AuthManager.swift` |
| `PaywallManager.shared` | Subscriptions | `Paywall/PaywallManager.swift` |
| `SettingsViewModel.shared` | User settings | `User/SettingsViewModel.swift` |
| `StreakDataProvider.shared` | Streak display | `Streak/ViewModels/StreakViewModel.swift` |
| `FirestoreManager.shared` | Firestore ops | `User/FirestoreManager.swift` |

### Data Flow

**Local Mode**: UserDefaults → ViewModel → View

**Cloud Mode**:
- Writes: View → ViewModel → FirestoreManager → Firestore
- Reads: Firestore → Listener → ViewModel → View

### Library/CMS System

Content is fetched from a GitHub repository:
1. `LibraryViewModel` fetches `index.json` from `AppConfiguration.libraryIndexURL`
2. Articles are filtered by publish/expiry dates
3. Content cached by `LibraryCacheManager`
4. Markdown rendered using MarkdownUI

## Configuration

All feature flags and API keys in `ios/Sources/App/AppConfiguration.swift`:

| Flag | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `useFirebase` | Enable Firebase backend |
| `enableAuth` | Show sign-in UI (requires Firebase) |
| `useRevenueCat` | Enable subscriptions |
| `useTelemetryDeck` | Enable analytics |
| `enableStreaks` | Enable streak feature |
| `enableLibrary` | Enable CMS feature |
| `enableWidgets` | Enable widgets |
| `enableAppReview` | Enable App Store review prompts |
| `appReviewStreakThreshold` | Streak count to trigger review (default: 7) |

## Authentication Strategy

The template supports **progressive onboarding** - a UX pattern used by successful apps like Duolingo:

### Recommended: Low-Friction Onboarding

```swift
useFirebase = true
enableAuth = false
```

**How it works:**
1. User launches app → anonymous Firebase account created automatically
2. Full Firestore sync works immediately (streaks, settings, user data)
3. No sign-in UI shown → user enjoys app without friction
4. User builds value (streaks, progress, settings)
5. Later, prompt contextually: "Sign in to save your streak across devices!"
6. When user signs in → anonymous account links to real account
7. All existing data preserved automatically via `migrateAnonymousUserData()`

**Why this works:**
- Reduces onboarding friction (no login wall)
- Users experience value before committing
- Streak becomes an incentive to create an account
- No data loss when upgrading to full account

### Alternative: Full Auth from Start

```swift
useFirebase = true
enableAuth = true
```

Sign-in option visible in Settings immediately. Good for apps where account is core to the experience (social features, multi-device sync from day one).

### Triggering Sign-In Contextually

You can prompt users to sign in at strategic moments:

```swift
// Example: After completing a streak milestone
if AuthManager.shared.isAnonymous && streakCount >= 7 {
    // Show custom prompt: "You're on a 7-day streak! Sign in to save your progress."
    // Then present LoginView or navigate to Settings
}
```

## App Store Review Strategy

The template includes smart App Store review prompting via `AppReviewManager`.

### How It Works

Reviews are requested when a user achieves their streak threshold (default: 7 days). This is optimal because:

1. **User has demonstrated engagement** - They've returned 7 days in a row
2. **Positive moment** - Achievement unlocked, user is happy
3. **Sufficient experience** - They've used the app enough to form an opinion
4. **Not intrusive** - Happens naturally during app flow, not as a popup on launch

### Configuration

```swift
// In AppConfiguration.swift
static let enableAppReview = true
static let appReviewStreakThreshold = 7  // Trigger at 7-day streak
```

### Apple's Safeguards

`SKStoreReviewController.requestReview()` has built-in protections:
- Apple limits how often the dialog appears (typically 3x per year)
- The system may choose not to show it based on user behavior
- Review prompt won't show in TestFlight builds

### Tracking

The `AppReviewManager` tracks whether a review has been requested for each threshold level. If you increase `appReviewStreakThreshold` from 7 to 30 later, users who were already prompted at 7 won't be re-prompted until they reach 30.

### Manual Reset (Testing)

```swift
// Reset tracking to test the review prompt again
AppReviewManager.shared.resetReviewTracking()
```
