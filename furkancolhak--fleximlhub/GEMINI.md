Worker: Saves the trained model, metrics JSON, plots, SHAP results, and logs to the output directory.

Worker: Updates task status to 'Completed'.

Frontend: Polls for status, displays results (metrics table, interactive plots, SHAP visualizations, links to download artifacts) when completed.

Mode: train

Similar to train_test, but only requires training data (can be the full uploaded dataset).

Skips the test set evaluation steps (prediction, metrics, plots on test data).

Saves the trained model. Evaluation might optionally be done on the training data itself or via CV during training.

Mode: test

User selects "Test/Predict" mode.

Uploads dataset for prediction.

Uploads or selects a previously saved/trained model file.

Selects relevant Feature columns (must match model's training).

Optionally uploads true labels if evaluation is desired.

Clicks "Run".

Backend/Worker: Load model, load prediction data, perform inference, record prediction time.

Backend/Worker: If true labels provided, calculate metrics and generate plots.

Backend/Worker: Save predictions to specified output file.

Frontend: Displays metrics/plots (if evaluated) and provides a link to download predictions.

Mode: tune

User selects "Hyperparameter Tuning" mode.

Uploads data (single file or pre-split Train/Validation/Test). Needs validation set for reliable tuning. If only Train/Test provided, Train might be further split internally based on config.

Selects Target and Feature columns. Configures data splitting if needed.

Selects HPO Library (Optuna, Scikit-learn) and Method (TPE, GridSearch, etc.).

Defines the Parameter Search Space using UI controls (sliders, inputs).

Selects the Metric to Optimize and Direction (max/min).

Configures CV settings (essential for robust HPO).

Sets HPO parameters (e.g., n_trials, timeout).

Clicks "Run".

Backend/Worker: Sets up the HPO study/search using the chosen library (e.g., optuna.create_study, GridSearchCV). Integrates the CV splitter.

Backend/Worker: Runs the HPO process, potentially logging progress per trial. UI shows progress bar based on task updates.

Backend/Worker: After completion, identifies the best parameters and best score.

Backend/Worker: Retrains the final model using the best parameters on the full training (or train+validation) set.

Backend/Worker: Evaluates the final best model on the hold-out Test set.

Backend/Worker: Saves the best model, best parameters, HPO study results (e.g., Optuna study object or trial dataframe), and test set evaluation results.

Frontend: Displays best parameters, best score, test set evaluation results, potentially HPO visualizations (e.g., Optuna plots), and download links.

Mode: continuous_train

User selects "Continuous Training" mode.

Selects/uploads the existing base model artifact.

Uploads the new dataset containing incremental data.

Configures retraining parameters (may depend heavily on the model type, e.g., epochs for NNs, warm_start for some tree ensembles).

Clicks "Run".

Backend/Worker: Loads the base model state. Loads the new data.

Backend/Worker: Continues the training process using the new data. Requires model support for incremental learning (e.g., warm_start=True in scikit-learn, partial_fit, or custom logic for NNs).

Backend/Worker: Saves the updated model (potentially as a new version).

Frontend: Reports completion and provides link to the updated model artifact. Evaluation on a holdout set might be added as an optional step.

Mode: batch_inference

User selects "Batch Inference" mode.

Selects/uploads the trained model artifact.

Uploads the large dataset for which predictions are needed.

Clicks "Run".

Backend/Worker: Loads model. Loads batch data (potentially in chunks if very large).

Backend/Worker: Saves the predictions to an output file (e.g., CSV with original features + prediction column).

Frontend: Reports completion and provides link to download the prediction file.

Mode: deploy_api

User selects "Deploy Real-Time API" mode.

Selects/uploads the trained model artifact.

Configures API deployment settings (e.g., port, number of workers - optional).

Clicks "Deploy".

Backend: Creates a lightweight API wrapper (e.g., using FastAPI) that loads the selected model.

Backend: Defines an API endpoint (e.g., /predict) that accepts input features (e.g., JSON payload).

Backend: The endpoint loads the model (ideally once on startup), processes input, calls model.predict(), and returns the prediction(s).

Backend: Launches the API server (e.g., using Uvicorn) potentially within a Docker container managed by the platform or provides instructions/Dockerfile for manual deployment.

Frontend: Displays the status (Deployed/Running), the API endpoint URL, and example usage (e.g., curl command or Python requests snippet). Note: Managing the lifecycle (start/stop/update) of these deployed APIs requires additional infrastructure considerations.

9. Data Handling Details

Supported Formats: CSV (initially). Plan to add Parquet (efficient for larger data), potentially JSON lines.

Data Splitting Strategies:

Random Train/Test/Validation split based on user-defined ratios.

Stratified splitting option for classification tasks to maintain class proportions.

Ability to use pre-defined train, validation, and test files.

Consistent use of random_state for reproducibility.

Feature & Label Selection: UI dropdowns/multi-select lists populated from uploaded data headers.

10. Model Management

Saving & Loading Models: Use joblib or pickle for Scikit-learn models. Specific methods for XGBoost/LightGBM (save_model, load_model). Consider ONNX for broader interoperability in the future.

Model Versioning (Basic): Use timestamps or run IDs in filenames or output directories. Store associated config file and metrics with each saved model. (Full versioning like DVC/MLflow is a future enhancement).

Metadata Tracking: Store run configuration, metrics, model artifact path, timestamps, etc., in the metrics JSON file or a dedicated metadata database table/file .

11. Evaluation & Reporting Details

Metrics:

Classification: Accuracy, Precision (binary/micro/macro/weighted), Recall (binary/micro/macro/weighted), F1-Score (binary/micro/macro/weighted), ROC AUC, Precision-Recall AUC.

Regression: Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), R-squared (R²), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).

Plots & Visualizations:

Confusion Matrix (Classification)

ROC Curve (Classification)

Precision-Recall Curve (Classification)

Feature Importance Plot (from model if available, e.g., tree-based models)

Residual Plots (Regression: Predicted vs Actual, Residuals vs Predicted)

SHAP Summary Plot (feature importance based on SHAP values)

SHAP Dependence Plots (selected features)

(Optional) SHAP Force plots for sample predictions.

SHAP Integration: Use the shap library. Select appropriate explainer based on model type (TreeExplainer, KernelExplainer, LinearExplainer). Generate summary plots and potentially dependence plots for top features. Store SHAP values if needed for deeper analysis.

Timing Metrics: Use Python's time module or timeit to capture:

Total training time.

Test set prediction time (total and average per instance).

Output Formats:

Metrics: evaluation_metrics.json (structured key-value pairs).

Plots: Save as image files (PNG, SVG) and/or embed interactive versions (Plotly JSON) in the UI.

Predictions: CSV file.

Model: .joblib, .pkl, .xgb, .lgb, etc.

12. Hyperparameter Tuning Details

Supported Libraries & Methods:

scikit-learn: GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV.

optuna: Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE - default), Random Search, CMA-ES, etc.

hyperopt: Bayesian Optimization (TPE).

Search Space Definition: UI elements map to library-specific definitions (e.g., lists for GridSearch, distributions/ranges like IntUniformDistribution, FloatLogUniformDistribution, CategoricalDistribution for Optuna/Hyperopt). Store this definition in the config.yaml.

Cross-Validation Integration: HPO methods like GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV, and Optuna integrations should inherently use the configured CV strategy during the evaluation of each trial for robustness.

Progress Tracking & Visualization:

Use Celery task states for overall progress.

Integrate library callbacks (e.g., Optuna callbacks) to log trial progress (trial number, params, score) to the main logs or potentially update the UI via websockets/polling.

Leverage Optuna's visualization functions (if using Optuna) to generate plots like optimization history, parameter importance, contour plots, etc., saved as artifacts.

Results & Artifact Saving: Save the best parameters found, the score achieved with those parameters, the trained model using the best parameters, and potentially the HPO study object (e.g., study.trials_dataframe() for Optuna) for later analysis.

13. Deployment Details

Batch Inference Workflow: Simple execution mode. Input: Model artifact path, data path (CSV/Parquet). Output: CSV/Parquet file with predictions appended. Designed for offline processing of large datasets.

Real-Time API Specification:

Framework: FastAPI recommended.

Endpoint: e.g., POST /predict

Input Format: JSON payload, e.g., {"features": [val1, val2, ...]} or {"col1": val1, "col2": val2, ...} or a list of such objects for mini-batch prediction.

Output Format: JSON response, e.g., {"prediction": [pred_value]} or {"predictions": [pred1, pred2, ...]}.

Deployment: Provide a Dockerfile to containerize the model and API server (Uvicorn + FastAPI). The "Deploy" action could build and run this container locally or provide instructions for cloud deployment. Requires Docker daemon access or integration with container orchestration.

14. Continuous Training Details

Workflow: Load existing model state -> Load new data -> Run training method (e.g., model.fit() again with warm_start=True, model.partial_fit(), or custom NN training loop continuation) -> Save updated model.

Considerations:

Model must support incremental learning. Not all algorithms do.

Potential for catastrophic forgetting (especially in NNs). May need techniques like learning rate adjustments, replay buffers.

Need to manage data drift – ensuring new data is relevant and potentially re-evaluating the model periodically.

Versioning becomes more important to track model evolution.

Phase 1 (Core CLI/Config): Focus on the backend logic, config file parsing, core train_test workflow for Scikit-learn models, basic evaluation (metrics JSON), model saving. Command-line execution.

Phase 2 (Basic UI & HPO): Add a simple UI (Streamlit/Gradio) for train_test. Implement tune mode with Scikit-learn HPO methods. Add basic plotting.

Phase 3 (Full UI & Advanced Features): Develop richer UI (React/Vue) or enhance Streamlit/Gradio. Add more models (XGBoost, LightGBM), Optuna HPO, SHAP, CV, train, test modes.

Phase 4 (Deployment & Continuous): Implement Batch Inference, Real-time API deployment, Continuous Training.

Phase 5 onwards: Future enhancements (AutoML, MLOps, etc.).

Testing Strategy:

Unit tests for individual functions (data processing, metric calculation, etc.).

Integration tests for workflows (e.g., running a small train_test cycle).

Use sample datasets for testing.

Automate tests using pytest.

CI/CD Pipeline: Use GitHub Actions or GitLab CI:

Run linters (e.g., Flake8, Black) on push/PR.

Run automated tests on push/PR.

(Optional) Build Docker images on merge to main.

(Optional) Deploy documentation.

18. Contribution Guidelines (Open Source)

Establish clear guidelines in CONTRIBUTING.md.

License: Choose a standard permissive license (MIT, Apache 2.0).

Issue Tracking: Use GitHub/GitLab issues for bug reports and feature requests.

Pull Requests: Require PRs for all code changes. Enforce reviews.

Coding Standards: Define style guides (e.g., PEP 8, Black formatting).

Testing: Require new code to be accompanied by tests.

Documentation: Encourage documentation updates with code changes.

19. Conclusion

FlexiML Hub aims to be a powerful yet accessible platform for various ML tasks. Its strength lies in its configurability and modularity. By focusing on clear workflows, robust evaluation, and extensibility, it can become a valuable tool for individuals and teams working with machine learning. The open-source nature will allow the community to contribute and shape its future development. This document provides a comprehensive blueprint, but flexibility during development based on challenges and opportunities is expected.
