# Agent improving — evals, traces, and honest fixes

Use this when you are asked to diagnose eval failures, tune the agent, or change prompts and skills based on scenario results. Use it as the **policy** for: inspect artifacts → trace-backed fixes. **Do not** re-run promptfoo or other eval suites from the agent unless the user **explicitly** asks you to; verification is the human’s or CI’s step.

Fragment shape for skills lives in [`prompt-modules.mdc`](prompt-modules.mdc); this file is process and discipline for eval-driven changes.

## Purpose

- Ground fixes in **what actually happened** in the pipeline (classifier output, retrieval, composed reply, and so on), not only in the final pass or fail string.
- Prefer changes that **generalize**: they should help whole *classes* of user inputs, not one scenario’s exact wording.
- **Never pass a test by breaking product behavior** that the test does not cover.

## Inputs (each iteration)

1. Prefer the **newest full run JSON** under `evals/results/`: files named like `promptfoo-<suite>-<timestamp>.json`. That file has complete `pipelineTrace` data. When present, [`evals/results/.promptfoo-latest.json`](evals/results/.promptfoo-latest.json) points at the raw result file the last summary used.
2. Use `*-summary.json` or `*-summary.md` only for a quick overview; they may truncate or sample traces.
3. For each failure, record **scenario id**, **step**, **failed checks or judge output**, and align with the **scenario rubric** so you know *which stage* should have behaved differently.
4. When the artifact makes it clear, tag the failure as a **deterministic check** (counts, schema, structured assertions) vs an **LLM judge** verdict. Prioritize trace-backed fixes for deterministic failures. Repeated judge disagreements on similar outputs may indicate rubric ambiguity or judge-prompt issues rather than product prompts alone.

## Diagnosis workflow (do not skip)

1. **Enumerate** failing scenarios from the full JSON.
2. For each failure, open **`pipelineTrace`** for the relevant assistant turn (and earlier turns if the scenario is multi-step).
3. Name the **failing stage** (for example classification, retrieval, worker prompt, reply composition).
4. Write a **one-line hypothesis** (for example “classifier merged two intents”, “wrong `decisions` branch”, “composer dropped structured facts”).
5. Prefer **one coherent change set per iteration** (not a grab bag): fix the **earliest wrong stage** first, then **re-read the trace**. Touch downstream prompts or handlers only if the failure persists after upstream is correct.
6. Keep the change set **small** for that iteration—address the hypothesis class without unrelated edits.

## Closing the iteration (mandatory)

1. After edits, **do not** start eval runs (for example `scripts/run-promptfoo.mjs`) on your own. Tell the user what changed and suggest **they** (or CI) run the relevant suite when they want a fresh pass/fail signal.
2. If the user pastes new results later, compare **pass or fail delta** (counts or scenario ids) and call out **new** failures. Fixing one scenario while regressing others is a sign of overfitting; widen or revert the change.

## Comparing eval runs

- Compare **the same suite** and, when possible, the **same repeat count** (`--repeat`); otherwise interpret pass rates carefully.
- **Row-level** pass % can mislead when total rows differ (for example 46 trials vs 138). Prefer **per-scenario** pass counts or the **mean of per-scenario pass percentages** from `*-summary.json` when both runs list the same scenario ids.
- If **aggregate** pass/fail counts are unchanged but **which scenarios** pass or fail **swaps** between runs, treat that as **variance** (and repeat/temperature effects) before blaming a specific prompt tweak.

## Prompt budget (300 tokens per contributing fragment)

Skills with `decisions/` trees merge multiple `entry.md` files via `assembleForkedSkillPrompt` in [`electron/services/skillLoader.ts`](electron/services/skillLoader.ts). The budget applies **per file**: each **`entry.md` body** you add or edit under `skills/skill-classification/` (after trim) should stay within **300 tokens** of instructional content.

- **Why per file**: Assembly joins many fragments; keeping each `entry.md` small forces **narrow leaves** and clear routing instead of one overloaded blob.
- **How to estimate**: Prefer a real tokenizer when available. If you only need a quick check, **approximate** with `ceil(characterCount / 4)` on the trimmed UTF-8 body (English-heavy markdown). Values near the ceiling should be tightened or split.
- **If content does not fit**: **Split**—add or deepen `decisions/<decisionKey>/<value>/` branches, move cross-cutting lines into a parent that only routes, and keep detailed rules in leaves. Do not “vague out” constraints just to save tokens.

**First-turn classifier** (`loadClassificationRootOnly` in `skillLoader.ts`): loads [`skills/skill-classification/entry.md`](skills/skill-classification/entry.md), then **every** [`skills/skill-classification/shared/first-turn-classifier/*.md`](skills/skill-classification/shared/first-turn-classifier/) fragment in **lexicographic** order, joined with `\n\n---\n\n`. **Each** of those files must satisfy the same **300-token** instructional budget. Full merge behavior for other skill ids stays in `skillLoader.ts`.

## Allowed fix levers

- **Parameters and settings**: thresholds, retrieval limits, cutoff scores, model choice, and other config the app already exposes.
- **Prompts and skills**: clarify constraints, ordering, failure modes, and boundaries in reusable language that reads like **durable policy**, not a ticket note.
- **Structural skill-tree changes** (encouraged when traces show **conflation** or unstable behavior across cases that should differ):
  - Add or refine **`decisions/<decisionKey>/<value>/`** directories and **`entry.md`** leaves so one path does one job.
  - Keep **parent** `entry.md` files thin: routing, scope, and what to defer to children. Put detailed behavior in **leaves**, each under the token budget.
  - **Wire-up must stay honest**:
    - New **mounted** skills or path changes may require updates to `shared/skillTreeSpec.ts` (`SKILL_MOUNT_SEGMENTS`, decision outcome constants if applicable).
    - Selectors passed to `loadSkill` must match **decision keys** and **directory names** under `decisions/`. Merge order for decision keys follows `DECISION_KEY_MERGE_PRIORITY` in `skillLoader.ts` (add new high-impact keys there if you introduce another ordered pipeline dimension).
    - Layout may be enforced by tests (for example skill tree alignment); do not run them from the agent unless the user asks—note that the human or CI should run alignment checks after structural edits.
- **Agent architecture**: additional stages, different handoffs, structured outputs between steps—when the error is fundamentally staged wrong, not just worded wrong.
- **Scalable ideas** that do not rely on brittle string matching or per-scenario hacks.

## Forbidden and weak approaches

- **Do not** add **scenario-specific NLU routing** (regex or similar on user text in handlers or executors) just to pass evals. Prefer prompts and durable policy; structured parsing for well-defined formats is fine when it is not a one-off test patch.
- **Do not special-case the scenario**: avoid instructions that only make sense for that test’s exact phrases, names, or IDs. Reframe as a general principle or policy.
- **Do not weaken success criteria** in tests or judges just to turn a failure green unless the user explicitly wants the rubric changed.
- **Do not fix evaluator-only issues in production prompts** if the real product answer was already correct for users.
- **Do not edit only final user-facing wording** when `pipelineTrace` shows an **earlier** stage failure—fix the stage that lied first unless the bug is purely presentational.

## The “are we cheating?” checklist

Before treating a change as done, ask:

1. **Trade-off**: Could this fix harm a reasonable user goal that is not in this test (for example skipping save, skipping retrieval, or always refusing a valid action)? If yes, revise.
2. **Narrowness**: Would this break or confuse inputs that are like the scenario but not identical? If the fix only works for the literal test string, generalize or use config or architecture instead.
3. **Stage honesty**: Does the trace show the real failure stage? Fix that stage—not only the final message formatting—unless the bug is purely presentational.
4. **Tree honesty**: If you added decision branches or mounts, does the runtime actually load them (spec, selectors, and tests updated)? An unread `entry.md` does not count as a fix.

## Collaboration

You may **disagree constructively** with the user’s assumptions when evidence (trace + rubric + product intent) supports a different fix.

## Optional reminders

- **Flakes and environment**: note if failures might be nondeterministic (model temperature, ordering); separate prompt bugs from instability.
- **Minimal reproduction**: for complex scenarios, trace the minimum user path that reproduces the bad stage.
- **Stopping**: if several iterations move traces but not pass rate, pause—consider rubric bugs, missing scenarios, or a different architecture lever rather than more prompt churn.

## Post-run prompt template (for the human or chat turn)

Use a short operator message after each eval run that **does not duplicate** this whole file. Example shape:

- Follow **Agent improving** (`agent-improving.mdc`).
- Pointer (if used): `evals/results/.promptfoo-latest.json` → raw `promptfoo-….json`.
- Full results file: `evals/results/<promptfoo-…>.json`.
- Suite and any focus scenarios or known flakes.
- After agent changes, **you** run `<eval command>` when you want verification; the agent does not run it unless you ask.
