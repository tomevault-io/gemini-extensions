## Setup

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install ".[dev]" twine
codex-usage-tracker install-plugin --python .venv/bin/python
```

## Branch And PR Workflow

This project is now a published PyPI package with user-facing docs, JSON/MCP contracts, a release workflow, and privacy guarantees. Treat `main` as always releasable.

### MCP-First Pivot Execution

Work in the MCP-first pivot must follow
`docs/roadmap/mcp-first-pivot.md` and its approved detailed implementation
roadmap. Use one focused `pivot/<task-number>-<slug>` branch per task, implement
only the task's declared interfaces, and update
`docs/roadmap/mcp-first-pivot-execution.md` in the same commit with branch,
commits, focused and full verification, deviations, and follow-up risks.

Do not add a dashboard workspace, top-level MCP concept, top-level CLI command,
runtime dependency, or SQLite table unless the roadmap names it or an approved
design amendment authorizes it. Compatibility removal must also be due in
`docs/deprecations.md`.

- Do not commit directly to `main`.
- Start each coherent task from current `main` with a short-lived branch.
- Use branch prefixes `feature/`, `fix/`, `docs/`, `chore/`, `test/`, `release/`, `hotfix/`, or `pivot/`. Reserve `pivot/` for tasks in the approved MCP-first roadmap.
- Keep each branch focused on one issue, one reviewable task, or one release.
- Do not create a long-lived `develop` branch.
- Do not mix release prep with unrelated feature work.
- Push task branches and open a PR for all changes headed to `main`.
- Prefer squash merge for ordinary task PRs so `main` stays readable.
- Use the PR as the review artifact even when there is only one maintainer.

Recommended branch names:

```text
feature/<issue-number>-short-description
fix/<issue-number>-short-description
docs/<issue-number>-short-description
chore/<issue-number>-short-description
test/<issue-number>-short-description
release/0.4.0
hotfix/0.3.3
```

Before starting a task branch:

```bash
git switch main
git pull --ff-only
git switch -c docs/123-short-description
```

## Agent Boundaries

Codex may create task branches, write tests, update docs, run local gates, prepare PR summaries, prepare release branches, and prepare changelog/version changes.

Codex must not do these without explicit maintainer approval:

- Push directly to `main`.
- Create or push release tags.
- Publish to TestPyPI or PyPI.
- Add PyPI or TestPyPI API tokens.
- Publish from a local machine.
- Change privacy semantics.
- Rename the PyPI distribution, import package, CLI command, plugin name, MCP tools, schema IDs, or stable JSON contracts.
- Delete branches.
- Force-push shared branches.

Publishing must happen only through the approved GitHub Actions Trusted Publishing workflow and protected `testpypi`/`pypi` environments.

## Issue And Milestone Workflow

Use GitHub issues as the normal unit of work once the task is non-trivial. A branch should usually map to one issue and close it from the PR.

Recommended labels:

```text
bug
docs
packaging
release
privacy
security
performance
dashboard
cli
mcp
parser-compat
good-first-issue
blocked
1.0-blocker
```

Recommended milestones:

```text
0.4.0
1.0-readiness
1.0.0
```

Use patch releases for public blockers such as broken PyPI installs, missing package data, broken CLI entry points, privacy leaks, bad plugin installs, or bad runtime pins. Put planned stabilization work into the next minor release instead of bundling it into a patch.

## Performance Work

Use the `agent-perf` skill and CLI when optimizing localhost API endpoints, dashboard refreshes, report generation, content indexing, parser or SQLite hot paths, or other latency- or CPU-sensitive code, and when investigating a performance regression or making a speedup claim.

Install the repository's pinned profiling tools with `uv sync --group performance`. Profile the smallest repeatable workload with synthetic or anonymized inputs; never profile production, live private databases, arbitrary processes, or real Codex session content. Record the identical workload without a profiler before making a performance claim. Change one suspected cause at a time, rerun the unprofiled workload, and use `agent-perf compare` only to compare attribution evidence rather than as proof of a speedup.

### Code intelligence tools

Use GitNexus for repository orientation, architecture, execution-flow tracing, subsystem discovery, and broad change-impact analysis.

Start unfamiliar or cross-cutting GitNexus work with the repository context resource, then open only the relevant cluster or process:

| Resource | Use for |
| -------- | ------- |
| `gitnexus://repo/codex-usage-tracker/context` | Codebase overview and index-freshness check |
| `gitnexus://repo/codex-usage-tracker/clusters` | Functional-area discovery |
| `gitnexus://repo/codex-usage-tracker/processes` | Execution-flow discovery |
| `gitnexus://repo/codex-usage-tracker/process/{name}` | One selected step-by-step execution trace |

Use Serena for exact symbol definitions, references, implementations, type-aware navigation, diagnostics, and symbol-level edits or refactors.

For unfamiliar or cross-cutting work, use GitNexus to identify where to investigate, then use Serena to verify the exact symbols before editing.

Treat GitNexus relationships as navigational guidance. Treat Serena as authoritative for precise symbol resolution and modification.

Confirm architectural conclusions against the source and relevant tests before changing behavior. Use `agent-perf` and an identical unprofiled workload for performance evidence; GitNexus may locate a hot path but does not prove a regression or speedup.

Do not repeat the same lookup in both tools unless validating an uncertain relationship or investigating conflicting results.

Refresh the GitNexus index after major branch changes, file moves, or architectural
refactors with `gitnexus analyze --index-only .`. Use the repo-local GitNexus skill
matching the task when a client supports it; do not load every GitNexus workflow by
default.

## Validation

Run focused tests first, then broader checks. Run the full local CI gate before opening or updating PRs that touch release, packaging, CLI contracts, MCP behavior, dashboard behavior, privacy behavior, schemas, generated docs/assets, or bundled plugin/skill files.

## Source Inspection And Tool Output

Large command outputs in Codex chat can be visually compacted by the transcript renderer. When inspecting source, especially after broad `rg`, `sed`, `nl`, generated dashboard assets, logs, or workflow output, do not treat a mangled rendered snippet as proof that the file is corrupt. Prefer small targeted file windows, `git diff`, `python -m py_compile`, focused tests, and CI as the source of truth. If exact syntax matters, inspect a narrow range or use a parser/compiler rather than relying on large printed source dumps.

Use this progressive inspection ladder:

1. Choose one first locator based on the question:
   - Use GitNexus for an unfamiliar subsystem, cross-cutting architecture, execution flow, dependency cycle, or broad change impact.
   - Use Serena for a known code symbol, exact definition, callers, references, implementations, types, diagnostics, or a symbol-level edit.
   - Use `rg -n` for an exact string, route, configuration key, SQL fragment, schema field, error text, documentation claim, or non-symbol asset.
   - Use `rg --files` when the filename or owning directory is unknown.
2. Do not run all locators by default. After GitNexus selects a code path, use Serena only on the relevant symbol before editing. After `rg` finds an exact non-code match, inspect that narrow file window directly.
3. Inspect symbol metadata, callers, and references before requesting source bodies.
4. Read the smallest useful source window, normally one symbol or roughly 80-160 lines.
5. Expand only to a dependency, caller, test, or contract needed to answer the current question.
6. Run the smallest relevant validation, then broaden checks in proportion to risk.

Start GitNexus searches with a small result limit and without `--content`; request full symbol content only after selecting the relevant process or symbol. Use Serena symbol overviews and reference queries before reading whole files. Do not dump entire directories, generated bundles, large JSON, full database rows, or multiple long files into one tool response.

Within one uninterrupted task, do not reread unchanged files, guidance, roadmap sections, or the complete diff unless context was compacted, the branch or guidance changed, evidence conflicts, or exact verification requires it. Persist durable cross-cutting findings in the active task report or execution ledger and reuse them. For edits, prefer a path-scoped diff; inspect the complete diff once when it reaches a stable review checkpoint.

Redirect oversized machine output to an ignored temporary file and extract a bounded summary with `rg`, `jq`, a parser, or a short read-only script. Keep the exact command and artifact path when the full result is evidence, but do not stream the full artifact into the conversation. Batch independent narrow lookups when useful, but do not concatenate unrelated large outputs.

These rules optimize context use, not correctness. Reopen source or rerun evidence whenever behavior, safety, privacy, or a public contract remains uncertain.

```bash
python -m ruff check .
python -m mypy
python -m pytest
python -m pytest --cov=codex_usage_tracker --cov-report=term-missing
python -m compileall src
find src/codex_usage_tracker/plugin_data/dashboard \
  -type f -name '*.js' -exec node --check '{}' ';'
python scripts/check_release.py
git diff --check
rm -rf dist build src/codex_usage_tracker.egg-info src/codex_usage_tracking.egg-info
python -m build
python -m twine check dist/*
python scripts/check_release.py --dist
```

Additional smoke checks for touched CLI surfaces:

```bash
python -m pytest
python -m compileall src
find src/codex_usage_tracker/plugin_data/dashboard \
  -type f -name '*.js' -exec node --check '{}' ';'
python -m build
python scripts/check_release.py --dist
git diff --check
python scripts/smoke_installed_package.py
codex-usage-tracker update-pricing --output /tmp/codex-usage-pricing.json
codex-usage-tracker update-rate-card --output /tmp/codex-usage-rate-card.json
codex-usage-tracker doctor
codex-usage-tracker doctor --suggest-repair
codex-usage-tracker dashboard --output /tmp/codex-usage-dashboard.html
codex-usage-tracker serve-dashboard --help
codex-usage-tracker init-allowance --output /tmp/codex-usage-allowance.json
codex-usage-tracker parse-allowance --output /tmp/codex-usage-allowance.json "5h 79% 6:50 PM Weekly 33% Jun 7"
codex-usage-tracker init-thresholds --output /tmp/codex-usage-thresholds.json
codex-usage-tracker init-projects --output /tmp/codex-usage-projects.json
codex-usage-tracker support-bundle --output /tmp/codex-usage-support.json
codex-usage-tracker pricing-coverage
codex-usage-tracker summary --preset by-subagent-role
codex-usage-tracker expensive --limit 5
```

For documentation-only branches, at minimum run:

```bash
python scripts/check_release.py
git diff --check
```

## Release Branches

Use release branches only for version/changelog/pinning/publish prep, for example `release/0.4.0` or `hotfix/0.3.3`.

Release branches may include:

- Version bumps.
- `CHANGELOG.md` updates.
- Install/version wording updates.
- Runtime package pins.
- Publish workflow tweaks.
- Release notes.
- Final smoke-test fixes directly tied to release readiness.

Release branches must not include unrelated features.

Recommended release sequence:

```bash
git switch main
git pull --ff-only
git switch -c release/0.4.0
# version/changelog/release edits
python -m ruff check .
python -m mypy
python -m pytest
python -m pytest --cov=codex_usage_tracker --cov-report=term-missing
python -m compileall src
find src/codex_usage_tracker/plugin_data/dashboard \
  -type f -name '*.js' -exec node --check '{}' ';'
python scripts/check_release.py
git diff --check
rm -rf dist build src/codex_usage_tracker.egg-info src/codex_usage_tracking.egg-info
python -m build
python -m twine check dist/*
python scripts/check_release.py --dist
git add .
git commit -m "Prepare 0.4.0 release"
git push -u origin release/0.4.0
```

Open a PR to `main` and merge only after CI passes. After merge, tag from updated `main`, not from an unreviewed release branch, and only after explicit maintainer approval:

```bash
git switch main
git pull --ff-only
git tag -a v0.4.0 -m "codex-usage-tracker 0.4.0"
git push origin v0.4.0
```

## Privacy Rules

- Never commit real Codex session logs.
- Never commit real prompts, assistant text, tool outputs, pasted secrets, message snippets, or raw Codex logs.
- The local content index may store bounded snippets in the user-owned SQLite database by approved design. Do not expose indexed/raw content through default CSV, generated HTML, support bundles, screenshots, aggregate JSON, fixtures based on real logs, or commits.
- Raw context may be read during refresh/content indexing or explicit selected-call context loading. Keep shareable outputs aggregate-first unless a command is explicitly documented as a local raw/content export.
- Keep fixture data synthetic.
- Keep local SQLite databases, CSV exports, HTML dashboards, caches, and virtualenvs out of git.
- Do not hard-code real current USD model pricing in source; refresh the local config from OpenAI's published pricing docs or use manual local overrides. Internal Codex model estimates must be explicitly marked as estimates with source and rationale metadata.
- Source-stamped Codex credit rate-card snapshots must include source/date metadata, confidence labels, and local override support. Manually copied allowance remaining values stay in local config only.

## Definition Of Done

- Parser and content-index handling are covered by synthetic session logs.
- SQLite refresh is idempotent.
- MCP tool functions return concise aggregate data by default; content-aware tools must be explicit local investigation surfaces.
- Dashboard generated HTML is aggregate-first and does not embed indexed/raw content.
- Doctor, summary presets, dashboard, and expensive-call views work from CLI and MCP wrappers.
- `codex-usage-tracker install-plugin` can register the installed package without relying on a source-checkout symlink.
- `python -m codex_usage_tracker` and `codex-usage-tracker --version` both work.
- Wheel and source distribution builds include plugin assets and the Codex skill.
- `scripts/check_release.py --dist` passes before any public release.
- Pricing coverage clearly separates configured, estimated, and unpriced model usage.
- Codex credit coverage clearly separates exact rate-card matches, inferred aliases, and missing credit rates.
- Dashboard Calls and Threads views share filters, totals, and aggregate-first hover details.
- Dashboard usage docs are updated when the visible dashboard workflow changes, and screenshots must be generated from synthetic data only.
- Dashboard refresh is localhost-only, generated HTML stays aggregate-first, and context loading is lazy, localhost-only, explicit, redacted, and not embedded in the static HTML payload.
- Subagent calls preserve logged parent-session metadata, latch to parent thread labels when available, and auto-review attachment is clearly marked when inferred.
- Tests and compile checks pass.
