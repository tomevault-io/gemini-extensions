# YouTube Shorts Clip Effects — Requirements (Software Engineering Channel)

This document defines **must/should** requirements for producing fast, legible, and rewatchable YouTube Shorts tailored to software‑engineering topics (code, CLI, APIs). Treat it as a checklist for scripting, editing, and QC.

---

## 1) Core Objectives

* **Clarity first:** Make the key idea understandable on a 6–6.7″ phone screen in noisy environments.
* **Retention:** Reset attention every **2–3 seconds** with a visual change (cut, zoom, highlight, overlay, B‑roll).
* **Replay loop:** The last **0.5–1.0 s** visually or verbally matches the opening to encourage automatic replays.

**Acceptance metrics (targets):**

* Average watch time ≥ **70%** of clip length.
* Rewatches (loops) ≥ **10%** of views for educational Shorts.
* Swipe‑away in first 3 s ≤ **25%**.

---

## 2) Technical Specs

* **Aspect & Resolution:** **9:16**, **1080×1920** (deliver in vertical sequence; no rotation hacks).
* **FPS:** 30 or 60 FPS. Use 60 FPS for cursor‑heavy UI or fast scrolling.
* **Codec/Container:** H.264 (High profile), MP4.
* **Bitrate target:** 12–20 Mbps VBR.
* **Audio:** AAC, 48 kHz, 320 kbps.
* **Safe areas:** Keep essential text/UI **≥130 px** from bottom/top edges to avoid UI overlays.

---

## 3) Visual Language & Effects (Required Behaviors)

### 3.1 Cuts & Pacing (MUST)

* **Hook in 1–2 s**: present the payoff or problem immediately.
* **Jump cuts** to remove all hesitations; no pauses > **300 ms** without a purposeful visual.
* **Cut cadence:** a visible change every **2–3 s** (hard cut, zoom, overlay swap, highlight move).

### 3.2 Zooms & Punch‑ins (SHOULD)

* **Punch‑in** on the important line/UI element: scale from **100%→115–135%** over **6–12 frames**.
* Keep **anchor** on the focal element (no drifting).
* Do not exceed **140%** total scale to avoid softness.

### 3.3 Speed Ramps (SHOULD)

* Use **1.25×–1.5×** on scrolling or typing sections.
* Ramp in/out over **4–6 frames**; avoid abrupt stutters.

### 3.4 Transitions (MUST)

* Prefer **hard cuts** or **cut‑on‑action**. Fancy wipes/whirls are disallowed.
* **SFX markers** (optional): 6–8 frame whoosh/pop to signal "before→after". Keep tasteful.

### 3.5 Overlays (MUST)

* **Highlight box** around code line/API parameter.
  * Border **4 px**, corner radius **8 px**, outer drop shadow (soft, subtle).
  * **Dim rest**: add a 60–75% blur/darken outside the highlight for 0.4–0.6 s during callouts.
* **Cursor halo** for clicks: radius **24–32 px**, 200–300 ms fade.
* **Keystroke overlay** (for CLI): monospace, top‑center, auto‑hide after **1.2–1.8 s**.

---

## 4) Code & UI Readability (MUST)

* **Editor theme:** high‑contrast light or dark; avoid low‑contrast "aesthetic" themes.
* **Font:** Monospace; **min 44 px** at 1080×1920 for primary code. Line height **1.2–1.3**.
* **Line focus:** use a left rule or background tint to mark the active line.
* **Scrolling:** page‑at‑a‑time or snap‑to‑line; never free‑scroll mid‑explanation.
* **Colors:** Do not rely on color alone; pair with underline/box for accessibility.

---

## 5) Captions/Subtitles (MUST)

* **Always present** (burn‑in or edited auto‑captions).
* **Casing:** Sentence case; avoid camelCase breaks across lines.
* **Layout:** Max **2 lines**, **28–32 characters/line**.
* **Placement:** Above bottom safe area; never cover code or key UI.
* **Style:** High contrast. Stroke **2–3 px** or soft drop shadow. No animated karaoke except selective **word‑highlight** synced to speech.

---

## 6) Audio, Music, and SFX

* **Voice is king** (MUST):
  * Peak ‑3 to ‑1 dBFS, average around **‑16 LUFS** for speech clarity.
  * Remove hums; gate light‑handedly to avoid pumping.
* **Music** (OPTIONAL, default OFF for heavy code demos):
  * Low‑key bed at **‑25 to ‑30 dBFS relative to voice**; duck under narration.
  * No lyrical vocals during explanations.
* **SFX** (SPARING): clicks/whooshes under **‑12 dBFS** peaks; never mask consonants.

---

## 7) Graphics & Typography

* **Brand kit:** consistent colors (≤1 primary, 1 accent), logo usage ≤ **1.0 s** in the hook or not at all.
* **Text cards:** max **6–10 words**; animate in ≤ **250 ms**.
* **Do not** use heavy gradients, drop‑shadows, or busy backgrounds behind small code.

---

## 8) Narrative Structure (MUST)

**Template:** Hook (≤2 s) → Demo (10–20 s) → Why it works (1–2 lines) → Payoff + loop (≤2 s).

* Keep a single **teachable moment**. If there are two, split into two Shorts.

---

## 9) Compliance & Rights (MUST)

* **Royalty‑free** music/SFX only.
* Only show code you have rights to publish; redact secrets.
* No licensed UI/brand elements unless permitted.

---

## 10) Delivery & Export (MUST)

* **Master export:** MP4, H.264 High, 1080×1920, 30/60 FPS, 12–20 Mbps, AAC 48 kHz/320 kbps.
* **File naming:** `shorts_YYYYMMDD_topic_hook_v01.mp4`.
* **Thumbnail/frame:** Choose a frame with readable code + clear promise text (≤4 words).

---

## 11) QC Checklist (Tick All Before Upload)

* [ ] Hook is visible & understandable in **≤2 s**.
* [ ] Visual change every **≤3 s**.
* [ ] Key line/API parameter is clearly highlighted during explanation.
* [ ] Captions: 2 lines max, no overlaps with UI.
* [ ] Speech intelligible on phone speaker; music bed, if any, doesn't mask.
* [ ] Loop: last second ties back to the first.
* [ ] No copyrighted audio/visuals.
* [ ] Export meets spec; safe areas respected.

---

## 12) Templates (Editor‑Agnostic)

**Punch‑in preset**
* Scale: 100→122%
* Duration: 8 frames
* Ease: out‑quad

**Highlight callout**
* Box: 4 px border, 8 px radius
* Dim: 40–50% black overlay outside box (300–500 ms)

**Speed ramp for scroll**
* 1.0×→1.35× (6‑frame ramp) → hold → 1.0× (6‑frame ramp)

**Whoosh SFX marker**
* Start on cut, length 200–250 ms, low‑mid emphasis

---

## 13) Disallowed

* Long animated transitions (spins, wipes, page curls).
* Low‑contrast code themes.
* Music louder than narration at any time.
* Caption karaoke for full sentences.
* More than one complex idea per Short.

---

### Notes for Software‑Engineering Content

* Prefer **cursor halo + line box** to laser pointers.
* Show **before/after** diffs with a vertical wipe or two‑up split for ≤ **1.2 s**.
* Provide copyable snippet via pinned comment; on‑screen text is summary only.

# Basic Effects Strategy

**Goal:** Convert a 1920×1080 (16:9) screen-recording with English speech into a crisp, vertical **1080×1920 (9:16)** Short with captions, title, and clean pacing—optimized for mobile legibility.

---

## Assumptions

* Input: `in.mp4` (1920×1080), 30/60 fps, English narration.
* Content type: screen recording with small facecam (bottom-left), diagrams/code/CLI.

---

## Pipeline (high level)

1. **Ingest → Audio cleanup → Speed/pitch → Smart reframing to 9:16 → Overlays (title, captions, progress bar) → Optional readability boosts → Export.**

---

## Requirements

### 1) Audio Cleanup (MUST)

* Normalize speech loudness to **-16 LUFS** (±1 LU).
* Peak limit at **-1 dBFS**; true peak ≤ **-1 dBTP**.
* Light broadband denoise and **de-ess** (center \~5–8 kHz) without lisping.
* Remove DC offset; resample to **48 kHz**, AAC at **320 kbps** on export.

### 2) Speed Change (MUST)

* Apply global speed **1.35×** to video **and** audio.
* Preserve voice pitch with time-stretch (no "chipmunk").
* Fallback ladder if artifacts detected: **1.30× → 1.25× → 1.15×**.

### 3) Reframe to 9:16 (MUST)

* Output canvas: **1080×1920**.
* **Smart crop** order:

  1. Try to keep **facecam + primary content** inside 9:16 window using face detection + saliency.
  2. If facecam blocks key UI, **reposition/scale** facecam to a free corner (see §6).
  3. If crop would hide important text, **pillarbox fill**: scale source to fit **height** and add a **blurred, darkened (20–30%)** duplicate as background. No black bars.
* Soft limit: avoid scaling the source above **100%** of its native vertical resolution to prevent softness.
* Safe areas: keep overlays **≥120 px** from top/bottom edges.

### 4) Captions (MUST)

* Source: ASR from English speech; auto-correct obvious terms (CLI/code).
* Style: **2 lines max**, **28–32 chars/line**, sentence case.
* Font: high-contrast sans; **stroke 2–3 px** or soft shadow.
* Position: **bottom** above safe area (≈ **MarginV 96–120 px**), never covering key UI.
* Timing: snap to speech with max **120 ms** offset; no karaoke except **single-word emphasis**.

### 5) Title Strap (MUST)

* Show for **0.8–1.5 s** starting at **0.0 s** (can persist up to 3 s if short).
* Position: **top** safe area; horizontal strap or compact pill.
* Copy: ≤ **6–10 words**; avoid jargon. Example: "LLM Task Flow: Core Data Model".
* Animation: fade/slide ≤ **180–250 ms**; no bouncy easing.

### 6) Facecam Handling (SHOULD)

* If present, **mask to circle** (soft 12–16 px feather), add subtle shadow.
* Size: **15–22%** of canvas width; opacity 100%.
* Auto-reposition to a corner **not** overlapping important content; add **4%** inset margin.
* If face adds no value for >5 s, **auto-hide** and re-show on new segment.

### 7) Readability Boosts (SHOULD)

* **Punch-in** on focal region: scale **1.15–1.25×** over **6–12 frames** (ease-out).
* **Spotlight** when explaining a line/box: darken outside a rectangle by **40–55%** for **0.4–0.8 s**.
* **Cursor halo** on clicks: radius **24–32 px**, 200–300 ms fade.
* **Speed-ramp scrolling** sections to **1.25–1.5×** with 4–6-frame ramps.

### 8) Progress Bar (MAY)

* Thin bar at bottom safe area (height **6–10 px**), animates linearly through duration.
* Color: brand accent; 60–80% opacity; never under captions.

### 9) Silence/Dead-Air Trim (MAY)

* Detect silence below `speech_dBFS − 20 dB` for ≥ **250 ms** and remove with **120 ms** pre/post handles.
* Ensure cut cadence does not exceed **1 cut / 500 ms**.

### 10) Color & Sharpness (MAY)

* Gentle contrast/levels auto; avoid crushed blacks on code.
* Add tiny unsharp mask on downscaled regions (radius 0.6–0.8, amount 0.4–0.6).

### 11) Branding (MAY)

* Tiny logo watermark (≤ **2.5%** width) top-right; auto-hide during title strap.

### 12) Export (MUST)

* Container: **MP4**, codec **H.264 High**, **30 or 60 fps** (match source).
* Bitrate target: **12–20 Mbps** VBR; keyint ≤ **2×fps**.
* Audio: AAC **48 kHz**, **320 kbps**.
* Filename: `shorts_YYYYMMDD_topic_v01.mp4`.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

* Output is **1080×1920** with no letterboxing; background blur used if needed.
* Speech intelligible on phone speakers; loudness around **-16 LUFS**.
* Title readable in <2 s and doesn't collide with captions.
* Captions never cover important UI; max 2 lines; consistent style.
* If facecam exists, it never obscures focal content and respects margins.
* Visual change (cut/zoom/overlay) at least every **≤3 s** during explanations.

---

## Tunable Parameters (defaults)

* `speed_factor = 1.35`
* `caption_fontsize = 42` (1080×1920), `caption_marginV = 100`
* `spotlight_opacity = 0.45`, `punch_in_max = 1.22`, `punch_in_frames = 8`
* `progress_bar_height = 8`
* `bg_blur_sigma = 18–24`, `bg_darkening = 0.25`
* `facecam_size_pct = 0.18`, `facecam_margin_pct = 0.04`

---

## Fallback Rules

* If ASR confidence < **0.8** on a segment, keep captions but mark with lighter emphasis; never skip.
* If smart crop cannot keep both facecam and focal UI, **prioritize focal UI**, downscale and move facecam.
* If readability falls below threshold (small text), force **pillarbox fill** and **no additional zoom** to avoid softness.

# Mouse-Following Dynamic Crop Strategy

**Goal:** Create engaging YouTube Shorts that dynamically follow the presenter's mouse cursor, intelligently cropping and panning a 1920×1080 screen recording to 1080×1920 while keeping the mouse focus area always visible and centered.

---

## Concept

Instead of static cropping or letterboxing, this strategy tracks mouse movement throughout the video and creates a "smart camera" that:
1. **Follows the cursor** - keeps mouse position in optimal viewing area
2. **Smooth transitions** - pans/zooms gradually between focus areas  
3. **Predictive framing** - anticipates where user will move next
4. **Content-aware** - avoids cutting off important UI elements

---

## Technical Requirements

### 1) Mouse Tracking (MUST)
* **Cursor detection**: Extract mouse coordinates for every frame using computer vision
* **Movement analysis**: Calculate velocity, acceleration, and direction vectors
* **Focus zones**: Define 3 priority areas in 1080×1920 frame:
  - **Primary zone**: Center 60% (optimal viewing)
  - **Secondary zone**: Outer 30% (acceptable but will trigger reframe)
  - **Edge zone**: Outer 10% (immediate reframe required)

### 2) Dynamic Cropping Algorithm (MUST)
* **Viewport calculation**: 1080×1920 crop window within 1920×1080 source
* **Smooth panning**: Use easing functions (ease-out) over 12-20 frames
* **Zoom levels**: 3 discrete zoom levels based on mouse activity:
  - **1.0x**: Full screen context when mouse is idle
  - **1.2x**: Medium zoom during moderate activity  
  - **1.4x**: Close zoom during precise work (drawing, coding)
* **Boundary constraints**: Never crop beyond source video edges

### 3) Motion Prediction (SHOULD)
* **Velocity-based**: Predict cursor destination 0.5-1.0s ahead
* **Pre-positioning**: Start panning before cursor reaches edge zones
* **Activity detection**: Distinguish between:
  - **Transit movement** (moving to new area) → pan quickly
  - **Work movement** (detailed interaction) → zoom in, minimal panning
  - **Idle state** (no movement >2s) → zoom out for context

### 4) Content Preservation (MUST)
* **UI element detection**: Use OCR/CV to identify important text, buttons, diagrams
* **Smart boundaries**: Avoid cropping through:
  - Text blocks mid-sentence
  - UI component boundaries  
  - Diagram connections
  - Code function definitions
* **Minimum visibility**: Ensure 80% of active UI elements remain visible

### 5) Smooth Cinematography (MUST)
* **Easing functions**: All camera movements use cinematic easing curves
* **Maximum pan speed**: Never exceed 15% of frame width per second
* **Stabilization**: Ignore micro-movements (<5 pixels) to avoid jitter
* **Transition timing**: 
  - **Quick transitions**: 8-12 frames (for following mouse)
  - **Context transitions**: 20-30 frames (for zoom level changes)

### 6) Engagement Features (SHOULD)
* **Cursor highlighting**: Add subtle glow/halo during important actions
* **Zoom indicators**: Brief scale animation when zoom level changes
* **Focus trails**: Subtle motion blur trail behind fast mouse movements
* **Click emphasis**: Temporary zoom-in (110%) on mouse clicks

---

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Mouse Detection
```python
# Extract cursor position for each frame
def extract_mouse_coordinates(video_path) -> List[Tuple[int, int, float]]:
    # Returns [(x, y, timestamp), ...] for entire video
    pass
```

### Phase 2: Motion Analysis  
```python
# Analyze movement patterns and predict focus areas
def analyze_mouse_motion(coordinates) -> MotionData:
    # Calculate velocity, acceleration, activity zones
    pass
```

### Phase 3: Dynamic Crop Calculation
```python
# Generate crop coordinates for each frame
def calculate_dynamic_crop(motion_data, frame_size) -> List[CropWindow]:
    # Returns crop coordinates with smooth transitions
    pass
```

### Phase 4: Video Rendering
```python
# Apply dynamic cropping with smooth transitions
def render_mouse_following_video(source, crop_data) -> VideoClip:
    # Create smooth panning/zooming video
    pass
```

---

## Tunable Parameters

* `mouse_follow_sensitivity = 0.8` (0=static, 1=instant follow)
* `prediction_lookahead = 0.75` (seconds to predict ahead)
* `zoom_idle_threshold = 2.0` (seconds before zoom out)
* `pan_max_speed = 0.15` (fraction of frame per second)
* `focus_zone_primary = 0.6` (center zone size)
* `transition_frames_quick = 10`
* `transition_frames_context = 25`
* `cursor_highlight_radius = 32` (pixels)

---

## Fallback Behavior

* **No cursor detected**: Fall back to basic_effects strategy
* **Cursor at edge**: Prioritize keeping cursor visible over smooth motion
* **Rapid movement**: Increase pan speed but maintain easing
* **Content collision**: Pause panning until safe crop area available

---

## Expected Benefits

* ✅ **Higher engagement**: Dynamic movement keeps viewers focused
* ✅ **Better comprehension**: Always shows what presenter is pointing to  
* ✅ **Professional feel**: Cinematic camera work vs static crops
* ✅ **Content preservation**: Intelligent cropping protects important elements
* ✅ **Mobile optimization**: Perfect 9:16 framing without content loss
