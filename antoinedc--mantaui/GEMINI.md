# AGENTS.md — context for future sessions

MantaUI is an Electron desktop client for `claude`/opencode sessions running on a
remote Linux box, reached **over HTTPS** (no SSH). Pipeline:
**xterm.js (renderer)** ↔ **HTTP/WS** ↔ **manta-server (`src/server/`, on the box)**
↔ **tmux + opencode** ↔ **claude**.

**HTTP-only is the sole transport.** The desktop reaches the box via direct
HTTPS to manta-server, authenticated with a `boxToken` obtained during pairing.
No SSH, no mosh, no tunnels, no `-L` forwards, no ControlMaster — **the server
IS the box**. The old SSH/PTY main-process transport (`src/main/pty.ts`,
`src/main/opencode.ts`, the event tunnel, forward-heal) was deleted; only two
transport modes remain (`src/shared/transport.mjs`): `http` (paired) and
`onboarding` (pre-pairing). See "Desktop transport (HTTP-only)" below.

The SAME manta-server serves the mobile/web front-end. Desktop and mobile are both
thin clients over the identical `/rpc` + `/events` HTTP surface; the desktop adds
only OS-integration bridges (clipboard, screenshot, file peek, notifications) via
its Electron preload. See "Mobile / web client" below.

**Runtime note (the code hasn't fully caught up to this yet):** once paired,
`src/renderer/main.tsx` swaps `window.api` to `httpApi` (`/rpc` + `/events`), so
EVERY renderer data call goes over HTTP. The Electron IPC path (`src/preload/` +
`src/main/index.ts` handlers) is now vestigial for data — it carries only the
pre-pairing `authClaim`/`authPair` channels plus the OS bridges. A large
dead-surface removal is tracked in **BET-124** (docs/preload cleanup). The
redundant `src/main/{schedule,secrets,webhook,sharedConfigSync}.ts` HTTPS
clients are already deleted and the `Api` type now lives in `src/shared/api.ts`.
Treat any `src/main/*` data client or IPC handler other than pairing + OS
bridges as dead.

See `README.md` for user-facing intro and `HANDOFF.md` for the most recent
session-state snapshot.

## NEVER STUB A CONTROL TO DO NOTHING

**If the user can press it, it MUST do something. Every time. No exceptions
outside tests.** A control that silently does nothing is the single most
expensive defect this codebase produces, because it is indistinguishable from a
broken backend, a broken build, and a broken app — so it gets reported as
"X is broken", debugged everywhere except the button, and the real answer turns
out to be that someone shipped an empty function on purpose.

The three legal outcomes of a press are:

1. **It does the thing** — and SAYS SO. An action whose result isn't visible on
   screen has not communicated anything; a save that shows no confirmation is
   read as a save that didn't happen (that exact bug: a working download
   reported as broken, twice).
2. **It fails, and says why** — an error the user can act on. "Couldn't save —
   the file is still on the server, try again" is a real outcome. A swallowed
   `catch {}` is not.
3. **It isn't there.** If the current platform / mode / state genuinely cannot
   perform the action, DON'T RENDER THE CONTROL (or render it disabled with a
   reason in the title). A hidden button is honest; a dead one lies.

What is explicitly BANNED:

- `foo: async () => {}` in ANY client shim, adapter, or platform layer, for
  anything a control invokes. **This is not a mobile-vs-desktop question.** The
  desktop swaps `window.api` to `httpApi` once paired, so every "mobile-only"
  no-op there is what the DESKTOP calls too — that is precisely how the download
  path (BET-1156) and then `revealInFolder` (#1215) both shipped as dead
  buttons while the real OS bridge sat right there in the preload, fully
  implemented. If a capability exists on the current platform, DELEGATE to it;
  if it doesn't, see outcome 3.
- Fire-and-forget calls for a user action (`void doThing()`), which turn a
  failure into a devtools-only rejection and a success into nothing at all.
  Await the result and report BOTH branches — `saveToDownloads`
  (`src/renderer/downloadFeedback.ts`) is the reference shape.
- `catch {}` with a "non-fatal" comment on a user-initiated action. Non-fatal to
  the PROGRAM, maybe; to the user it is the whole point of the click.
- A TODO-shaped placeholder handler on a shipped control. Ship the control when
  it works, not before.

The ONE legitimate no-op is an EVENT SUBSCRIPTION for a signal a transport never
emits (e.g. `onScreenshotDetected` on a phone: nothing fires it, so nothing is
missing and no control is dead). That is a listener, not an action. Do not
generalise it into a licence to stub actions — that generalisation is the bug.

**Known outstanding violation** (fix it, don't copy it): `peekRemoteFile` in
`httpApi.ts` falls through to an RPC no-op because no `ipcMain` handler was ever
registered, so clicking an absolute path in the terminal does nothing at all.
The comment there explains why it was left; the explanation is not a defence.

## Layout

- `src/server/` — **the core.** Node HTTP+WS server that runs **on the Linux
  box** and owns everything: tmux, opencode, config, schedules, secrets,
  webhooks, push, peers, serve-page. It's what both the desktop and the
  mobile/web client talk to over HTTPS. Serves the React renderer built by
  `build:mobile`. Module tree: `index.mjs` (entry + `/rpc` + `/events` + REST
  `/api/*`), `rpc.mjs` (channel dispatch — the `window.api` contract server
  side), `tmux.mjs`, `opencode.mjs` (HTTP proxy to opencode on `127.0.0.1:4096`
  + SSE), `pty.mjs`, `events.mjs` (bus + SSE), `local.mjs` (config/git/fs),
  `status.mjs`, `push.mjs`, `schedule.mjs`, `secrets.mjs`, `webhooks.mjs`,
  `servePage.mjs`, `peers.mjs`, `outbox.mjs`, `auth.mjs`.
- `src/renderer/` — React + xterm.js UI (desktop `App.tsx` + mobile
  `MobileApp.tsx`). `Terminal.tsx` is the only place that owns an xterm
  instance. `ChatPanel.tsx` is the entire chat-mode UI (~2285 LoC).
  - `api/httpApi.ts` — implements the full `Api` contract over `/rpc` +
    `/events`. **This is the live data path on BOTH desktop and mobile.**
    `main.tsx` installs it as `window.api` when paired.
  - `preloadAccess.ts` — the narrow `MantaPreload` interface: the ~9 OS bridges
    the renderer reaches via `window.__mantaPreload` (clipboard, openExternal,
    reveal, screenshot, file peek, desktop-notify, getPathForFile).
  - `chatUtils.ts` — pure utility functions extracted for testability
    (`formatTokens`, `formatDuration`, `ctxStageColor`, `filterCommands`,
    `dedupeAgainstBuiltins`, `resolveContextLimit`, `classifyFinish`,
    `describeTruncation`, `isTerminalTodo`, `allTodosTerminal`).
    Import from here; don't redeclare them inline in ChatPanel.
- `src/preload/` — Electron `contextBridge`. Exposes OS-integration bridges as
  `window.__mantaPreload`. The `Api` type it used to own now lives in
  `src/shared/api.ts`, which typechecks `httpApi`. NOTE: it still *declares*
  ~30 methods but nearly all are dead in HTTP mode (their `ipcMain` handlers
  were removed) — the runtime only needs the OS bridges + `authClaim`/`authPair`.
  Exactly one declared method is dead: `peekRemoteFile`. See BET-124 / the
  preload-shrink epic.
- `src/main/` — Electron main process, now **OS-integration + pairing only**:
  screenshot detector, clipboard, drag-drop, `desktopPresence.ts`,
  `desktopNotify.ts`, `autoUpdate.ts`, `auth.ts` (pairing claim), `config.ts`
  (local `{serverUrl, boxId, boxToken, projects}` store). It does NOT own tmux,
  pty, or opencode anymore — those live in `src/server/`. `src/main/` holds
  only `auth.ts`, `autoUpdate.ts`, `busConsumer.ts`, `capExecutor.ts`,
  `config.ts`, `desktopNotify.ts`, `desktopPresence.ts`, `index.ts`,
  `serverUpdateForwarder.ts`, `unpair.ts`, `windowChrome.ts`, plus `installer/`
  and tests.
- `src/shared/` — transport mode resolution (`transport.mjs`), plus pure logic
  shared by renderer + server (`groq.mjs`, `subagentSync.mjs`,
  `modelGuide.mjs`).

## Native iOS app — see `mobile/native/AGENTS.md`

The Swift/iOS client has its own agent guide at **`mobile/native/AGENTS.md`**: architecture,
the xcodegen build model, how to verify Swift changes (there is no Swift toolchain on the Linux
box), the Swift 6 concurrency rules, and the transcript-list crash history. Read it before
touching anything under `mobile/native/`.

## Build / run

```
npm install
npm run typecheck
npm test              # vitest (renderer) + node:test (src/server/*.test.mjs)
npm run test:server   # node:test only (src/server/)
npm run test:watch    # vitest watch mode (renderer only)
npm run dev           # main-process AND preload changes need a full Ctrl+C + restart
npm run mobile        # server on $MANTA_MOBILE_HOST:$MANTA_MOBILE_PORT (default 0.0.0.0:8787)
```

The preload bundle is built once at dev-server start; renderer HMR alone won't
pick up new `window.api` methods. If you add an IPC channel and don't see it
on `window.api`, you didn't restart.

**BET-559 retired the mobile/web client and its bundle/publish pipeline.**
The box no longer serves a web/PWA bundle, `src/server/index.mjs` no longer
has a `PUBLIC_DIR`, and `build:mobile` / `mobile-bundle-deploy.yml` /
self-update's bundle fetch are gone. The renderer (`src/renderer/`) is the
desktop Electron app only; the native iOS client is `mobile/native`. The text
below is the historical record of the retired bundle model.

- **On a feature branch: just edit the source** (`ChatPanel.tsx`, `mobile.css`,
  `src/renderer/**`, the service worker under `src/renderer/public/`). Do NOT
  run `build:mobile` and commit `mobile/www/` — it's ignored, and committing it
  is what used to make every two in-flight PRs conflict on the content-hashed
  filenames + `index.html`'s `<script src>` (BET-118). If you want to preview on
  a device before merge, `npm run build:mobile` locally and test — the output is
  ignored, so nothing to un-stage.
- **On merge to main: CI builds the bundle and publishes it as a release
  ARTIFACT — it is NOT committed to git.** `.github/workflows/mobile-bundle-deploy.yml`
  runs `build:mobile` on every push to `main` and uploads the result to the prod
  release host as `releases/mobile-<gitsha>.tar.gz` + a `releases/mobile-latest.txt`
  manifest (git sha + filename + sha256), scp'd over SSH with the same
  `PROD_SSH_KEY` repo secret as `website-deploy.yml` (GitHub-hosted
  `ubuntu-latest`). **No auto-PR, no commit to main, no
  loop-guard** — the old `build-mobile-bundle.yml` (which committed the bundle
  back through an auto-merged `chore(mobile): rebuild …` PR) was deleted because
  committing generated bytes on every merge meant PR churn + CI minutes + build
  artifacts in source history.
  - **Two consumers fetch the bundle instead of relying on a git commit:**
    - *Fresh install* (`scripts/install.sh`) already builds its own bundle via
      `scripts/release/pack.mjs` (`npm run build:mobile`) inside the release
      tarball — UNAFFECTED by this change.
    - *Ongoing self-update* (`scripts/self-update.sh`) downloads + sha256-verifies
      + extracts `mobile-latest.txt`'s tarball AFTER `git reset --hard origin/main`
      (which now leaves NO `mobile/www/` since it's gitignored). The fetch is
      NON-FATAL: if the release host is unreachable the box keeps its existing
      `mobile/www/` and the server still runs. `MANTA_RELEASE_HOST` overrides the
      host (default `https://mantaui.com`), same knob as install.sh.
  - **Deploy stays "pull + restart, no Vite build on the box"** — the box never
    runs `build:mobile`; it only downloads a prebuilt tarball. The workflow
    serializes via a concurrency group so two quick merges don't race, and
    verifies the published bundle is live + sha-matches before going green.

Symptom if the bundle is stale on a device: the desktop Electron app shows your
changes (it runs Vite live), but the phone PWA looks unchanged. On main this
means the `mobile-bundle-deploy` workflow hasn't finished (or failed), OR the
box's `self-update.sh` hasn't run since the publish — check the workflow run and
`curl https://mantaui.com/releases/mobile-latest.txt` (its `git_sha` should match
main's HEAD).
**No server restart is needed** — manta-server reads the static files per-request
and sends `no-store` on `index.html` (so the next PWA launch / hard-refresh
pulls the new content-hashed JS/CSS automatically). The service worker does NO
asset caching (`mobile/www/sw.js`), so it isn't the culprit. To see changes
on-device: force-quit + reopen the iOS PWA (or hard-refresh the browser).
Desktop is unaffected by this — only the mobile/web client serves from
`mobile/www/`.

**CI runs on fresh GitHub-hosted runners — free + unlimited, and in parallel.**
MantaUI is a **PUBLIC** repo, so GitHub-hosted standard runner minutes are free
and effectively unlimited, with **20 concurrent jobs**. On 2026-08-01 the repo
dropped its last self-hosted runner (`manta-dev-runner`, the old single dev-box
runner that serialized every job into one queue) and moved **every** workflow to
`ubuntu-latest` (or `macos-14` / `windows-latest` where needed). Before the
2026-07-27 pass a PR cost **13.2 minutes of exclusive runner time** across six
jobs in three workflow files, four of them repeating the same checkout and
`npm ci`; the one-runner queue that motivated that cost discipline is gone.

Two non-minute caveats that still matter on a free public repo: **artifact +
GitHub Packages storage is 500 MB (GitHub Free) and shared** — keep artifact
retention short (e.g. 7d, not 90d) and prune old releases, because the
`server-tarball`, `windows-desktop`, and `macos-install-smoke` jobs upload large
artifacts — and Actions **cache** is 10 GB/repo. Minutes themselves aren't a
budget.

Everything lives in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` as **two** jobs:

| Job | Required? | What |
|---|---|---|
| `typecheck-test` | **yes — the only one** | `npm run typecheck`, `npm test`, gitleaks secret scan, conditional dependency audit, advisory duplication sticky comment |
| `duplication-gate` | no | strict jscpd gate; de-required 2026-07-02 (flaky at token boundaries) but still goes red as a signal |

(The `E2E Smoke Test` job — Electron + Xvfb smoke under `xvfb-run -a` — was
removed from `ci.yml`: it was flakier than the deterministic gates. Its script
`scripts/check-e2e-smoke.sh` and `tests/e2e/**` stay in the repo, runnable
locally.)

The GATE-2 tamper-proof property still holds: `typecheck-test` runs on fresh,
ephemeral GitHub-hosted runners (arguably *more* isolated than the maintainer's
long-lived dev box), so the PM's `gh pr checks` check is still independent of
whatever an implementer agent claims locally. Job names are unchanged, so
`required-checks.json` and the `main` ruleset are untouched.

What changed (mirrors tenanture TEN-618): `security-gates.yml` and
`anti-spaghetti.yml` were deleted and their steps moved into `typecheck-test` —
same detectors, same blocking semantics, three fewer runner slots. `node_modules`
is cached on the lockfile hash and Playwright browsers on the same key, so
`npm ci` and the browser download run only when the lockfile actually moves;
that was the bulk of the waste. With jobs parallel, splitting a job out no longer
queues other PRs — only keep a step a step when the logic is co-located.

**`macos-install-smoke.yml`** (GitHub-hosted `macos-14`, Apple Silicon) installs
the box END-TO-END the way a user does (`curl mantaui.com/install.sh | bash`) and asserts the macOS-only path
actually works: LaunchAgents load and stay alive, manta-server + opencode answer
on loopback, the tail prints a 6-digit pairing code, no `systemctl` advice is
ever printed (BET-277), `manta pair` mints a fresh code, `/auth/claim` exchanges
it for a real box token, that token drives a tmux RPC (which catches the launchd
PATH trap — launchd agents do NOT inherit a login-shell PATH, so a Homebrew-only
`tmux` is invisible to the server), and a re-install preserves the box identity.
Triggers: manual, weekly cron, and PRs that touch `scripts/install*.{sh,mjs}` /
`scripts/launchd/**` (those run the BRANCH copy of the script, deployed from the
PR's own commit — install.sh resets `$MANTA_HOME` to `origin/main`, so without
that a PR's server/plist changes would never be the ones under test). Gateway
registration is stubbed to a dead loopback port for the INSTALLER, but the
server re-registers itself on boot, so each run still leaves one throwaway
`<box_id>.boxes.mantaui.com` A record on the prod zone.

**Two environment traps this workflow found, both of which made a macOS box
look installed-and-paired while being unusable.** Neither is reachable from a
unit test; if you touch service definitions or tmux invocation, keep them in
mind:

- **A service gets no PATH.** launchd hands an agent
  `/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin`; it does NOT inherit a login shell's PATH.
  macOS ships no tmux, so tmux is always a Homebrew binary and was invisible to
  manta-server — `tmux:new-session` 500'd with ENOENT while `listProjects`
  swallowed the error and reported an empty box. Both plists now carry a PATH
  rendered by `launchd_agent_path` in install.sh.
- **A service gets no LOCALE, and tmux mangles its own output without one.**
  Under a non-UTF-8 locale tmux sanitises "unprintable" bytes in `-F` output,
  so the TAB field separator `src/server/tmux.mjs` relies on came back as `_`:
  `list-sessions` reported the session name as `<name>_<attachedFlag>` and every
  window line then failed to match a session and was silently dropped. Fixed at
  the single tmux spawn point (`tmuxSpawnEnv`) rather than in a plist/unit, so
  it holds under launchd, systemd, the nohup fallback and any hand-rolled
  supervisor. **Linux was latently exposed too** — the systemd unit declares no
  locale either; it only escaped because the box runs tmux 3.4.
- **Windows SSH auth fails for non-Unix reasons.** The OpenSSH Agent service is
  disabled by default on Windows 10/11, and PuTTYgen writes `.ppk` keys OpenSSH
  cannot read. Both surface as a generic `Permission denied (publickey)` over SSH
  with no hint of the real cause — a Windows user with an unconfigured agent or a
  PuTTY-only key sees the preflight's auth-failed step and nothing more. The
  installer's preflight now runs two LOCAL probes (`windows-agent` via `ssh-add -l`,
  `key-format` via the `~/.ssh/id_*` file header) on `process.platform === 'win32'`
  and surfaces a structured failure with the Windows-specific fix, but only when
  auth already failed — a working Windows setup (unencrypted OpenSSH key, or a key
  the agent already holds) must not be blocked by a stray `.ppk` file sitting
  unused in `~/.ssh`. See `src/main/installer/preflight.ts` (BET-362).

**`main` is governed by ONE system: the ruleset** (Settings → Rules → Rulesets →
"main"). The legacy per-branch protection rule was deleted 2026-07-27 because
GitHub enforces the UNION of both, so having two overlapping configs meant an
edit in one screen silently did nothing — exactly what happened while shrinking
the required checks. The ruleset also carries the guarantees the classic rule
did not (no deletion, no force-push, PR required) and, unlike classic
protection, is readable through the API with an ordinary token, so the sync rule
below can actually be verified. Do not re-add a classic branch protection rule.

Two rules that are load-bearing, not stylistic:

- **The dependency audit runs on a PR only when that PR changes
  `package.json`/`package-lock.json`.** Its result depends on the dependency
  set, not on the PR's code, so auditing every PR re-measures `main` — and the
  day a new upstream advisory lands, every open PR goes red at once through no
  fault of its own. `dep-audit-nightly.yml` covers `main` daily instead, so an
  advisory surfaces as one red run and one fix issue. tenanture hit the mass-red
  failure five times (TEN-574/585/588/589/606) before splitting it this way.
- **`required-checks.json` must stay in sync with the `main` branch ruleset's
  required contexts.** They are two separate places (one in git, one in GitHub
  config). Requiring a context no job produces blocks every PR forever, so when
  changing job names update the ruleset FIRST, then merge the workflow change.

The ruleset itself is deliberately **not strict** (branches need not be up to
date with `main` before merging). Do not turn that on: with several agent PRs in
flight it forces every merge to invalidate every other PR, which is O(N²) rebase
+ re-review + re-run churn. tenanture enabled it (TEN-386) and had to undo it
(TEN-617).

Git-synced (since 2026-05-16). Single source of truth:
`git@github.com:antoinedc/MantaUI.git` (public). Both the remote dev box
(`dev@157.90.224.92:/home/dev/projects/better-ui`) and the Mac are clones
tracking `origin/main`. **No more rsync** — push from whichever side you
worked on, `git pull` on the other before starting. Commit as you go;
`git log` is the cross-session audit trail.

## Keybindings

Window-scoped, in `App.tsx`. xterm-internal handlers (⌘C/V/F/K) live in
`Terminal.tsx` and only fire when the terminal has focus.

| Shortcut    | Action                                       |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| ⌘N          | New project (workspace)                      |
| ⌘T          | New session in active project                |
| ⌘1..9       | Jump to nth (project, window) in sidebar     |
| ⌥⌘↑ / ⌥⌘↓ | Step prev/next session, wraps both ends     |
| ⌘I          | Toggle the Artifacts panel (chat pane active only) |
| ⌘,          | Open Settings                                |
| ⇧⌘M         | Voice (chat composer): tap toggles recording on/off, hold is push-to-talk |

The voice row is a capture-phase handler in `src/renderer/hooks/useVoice.ts`,
not a window-scoped `App.tsx` one; while a take is active, `Enter` stops +
sends, `Space` pauses/resumes (only when the composer textarea isn't focused),
and `Esc` discards. The old no-shift binding was retired — it collided with the
terminal's carriage return and sat on Wispr Flow's conflict list.

Flat order for ⌘1..9 / ⌥⌘ navigation comes from `flatSessions(projects)` —
the sidebar's top-down (project, window) tuple list. Don't reorder it without
checking the keybind handler.

## File transfer

All file transfer is over HTTP to manta-server — no SSH, no scp, no ControlMaster.
The server IS the box, so every operation is a direct `POST`/`GET` to
`<serverUrl>/api/*` with `Authorization: Bearer <boxToken>`.

**Drag in (upload).** Drop a file on the active terminal → `POST
<serverUrl>/api/upload?session=<name>` streams the bytes straight to
`~/.manta-uploads/<session>/<batch>/<file>` on the box. `webUtils.getPathForFile(file)`
in the preload extracts the local path (Electron 31+ removed `File.path`, so the
renderer can't read it directly). A window-level dragover/drop swallow in
`App.tsx` keeps missed drops from navigating the renderer to `file://`. The
absolute remote path is written into the PTY for claude to read.

**Click out (peek).** xterm `LinkProvider` for absolute paths + an explicit
click handler on `WebLinksAddon`. Path click → `GET
<serverUrl>/api/peek?path=<abs>&session=<name>` streams the remote file bytes
back → `__mantaPreload.peekRemoteFile` returns them to the renderer, which
opens the file with the OS default app. URL click →
`shell.openExternal`. **Don't rely on WebLinksAddon's default** — its
`window.open` path gets denied by `setWindowOpenHandler` in `main/index.ts`, so
URLs silently no-op.

**Hourly cleanup** of `~/.manta-uploads/`: `find -mindepth 2 -maxdepth 2 -type d
-mmin +N -exec rm -rf {} +` deletes per-batch `<ts>` directories, then prunes
empty session dirs. Threshold is `uploadCleanupHours` in config (default 1,
`0` disables). Sweep runs once at app load + every hour after; worst-case
staleness ≈ `uploadCleanupHours + 1h`.

**Agent → laptop push (outbox / download).** The reverse of drag-in: the remote
AI sends a file via the `send_file` tool, which manta-server copies into
`~/.manta-outbox/<sessionID>/` (the workspace-linked artifact mailbox; the AI
keeps its working copy). MantaUI detects it and can pull it to the Mac's
Downloads folder via `GET <serverUrl>/api/download?path=<relative>`.
Detection is a 3s **outbox poller** (`pollOutboxOnce` → `GET /api/outbox?session=<name>`
→ JSON listing) / the server-side `startOutboxPoller`, mirroring the screenshot
Desktop watcher's philosophy (cheap periodic check, push a toast). The outbox is
a **durable, TTL'd artifact store**, NOT a one-shot mailbox: files are
**not deleted on download** (both `/api/download` and the artifacts panel's
`/api/peek` leave the source in place), they're workspace-linked (the subdir is
the opencode session id, so each artifacts panel shows only its conversation's
files), and a server sweep (`expireArtifacts`, every 5 min) removes them once
their TTL elapses (default 7 days). The poller keeps a `seenOutboxPaths` set
(cleared on host change) reconciled against the live listing each tick so a
require-confirm toast the user hasn't answered isn't re-offered every 3s.

- **Trust flag `allowAgentPush`** (AppConfig, default OFF, Settings UI). ON =
  download immediately + informational toast ("↓ name · saved to Downloads ·
  Reveal"). OFF = a confirm toast ("AI sent you a file · Save / ×"); the
  renderer's `saveAgentFile` calls `agentPullFile` on Save. Mirrors
  `chatAutoAllow`'s shape but is a SEPARATE flag — writing to Downloads is a
  different trust boundary than auto-allowing tool runs.
- **`downloadsDir`** (AppConfig) overrides the destination; empty →
  `app.getPath("downloads")`. Resolved in `resolveDownloadsDir()`.
- **Toast** is a single global instance like the screenshot toast:
  `agentFileToast` in the store, App.tsx owns the one `onAgentFileReady`
  listener, the active ChatPanel renders it. De-dupe on collision via
  `uniqueLocalPath` (`report.pdf` → `report (1).pdf`).
- **`/api/download` is scoped to the user's HOME dir, not to the outbox
  (BET-1195).** Inline media shown via `media_show` can sit at ANY path inside
  home — the tool never copies it into the mailbox — so an outbox-only guard
  meant a file the transcript happily DISPLAYED (`/api/peek`, already
  home-scoped, same bearer) could not be SAVED: the download 403'd, the desktop
  bridge returned `""`, and the renderer threw a bare "download failed". The two
  routes now share one rule. This does not widen what an authenticated client
  can read; it only stops display and download from disagreeing.
- **Every download REPORTS ITSELF (BET-1198) — `saveToDownloads` in
  `src/renderer/downloadFeedback.ts` is the one non-toast call site.** The
  inline-media hover/preview Download and the artifacts row were previously
  fire-and-forget: a success showed nothing and a failure showed only an
  "Uncaught (in promise)" in devtools, so the two were indistinguishable from a
  dead button — a WORKING save was reported as broken more than once. Rules:
  desktop success → a confirmation toast naming the **full destination folder**
  (`Saved dog.mp4 to /Users/x/Downloads`) + Reveal; mobile/web (`agentPullFile`
  returns `""`) → silent ON PURPOSE, the browser owns that chrome; failure → an
  error toast saying the file is still on the server. The agent-file toast keeps
  its own Save→Reveal lifecycle but shares the copy via `savedToastMessage`.
  Name the folder, never just "Downloads": `downloadsDir` makes that ambiguous.
- **The AI sends files via the `send_file` tool** (`docs/opencode-tools/send-file.ts`,
  a manta-native opencode tool like `serve_page`). It POSTs the file path + its
  `context.sessionID` to `POST /api/outbox/push`, which copies the file into
  `~/.manta-outbox/<sessionID>/` (workspace-linked) and hands it a TTL (default
  7 days, or `ttlHours:0` for never). Install on the remote opencode host:
  `cp <repo>/docs/opencode-tools/send-file.ts ~/.config/opencode/tools/send-file.ts`
  plus the shared `manta-auth.ts` module it imports
  (`cp <repo>/docs/opencode-tools/manta-auth.ts ~/.config/opencode/tools/manta-auth.ts`),
  then restart `opencode-serve`. The legacy `/send-file` markdown command
  (`docs/opencode-commands/send-file.md`) still works for a bare `cp` to the
  root, but that path is NOT workspace-linked.
- **Mobile** has no Mac Downloads folder (the server IS the box). A server-side
  outbox poller (`src/server/outbox.mjs`, `startOutboxPoller` wired in
  `index.mjs`) `readdir`s `~/.manta-outbox/` locally every 3s and publishes
  `{kind:"agentFile"}` bus events; the httpApi shim's `onAgentFileReady`
  subscribes to that kind. Every detection is a CONFIRM toast (`autoPulled:false`)
  — there's no silent disk write to a phone/browser. Tapping Save calls
  `agentPullFile`, which triggers a browser download via `GET /api/download`
  (`src/server/index.mjs`, path-traversal-guarded to `~/.manta-outbox/`). The
  download is **non-destructive** — the source stays until the TTL sweep
  reclaims it. The mobile `agentPullFile`
  returns `""` (no OS path to reveal) so the toast dismisses instead of showing
  a dead "Reveal" button; `revealInFolder` is a no-op. `MobileApp.tsx` wires the
  `onAgentFileReady` listener (mirror of `App.tsx`). Pure scan logic
  (`createOutboxScanner`, `listOutbox`) is tested in `src/server/outbox.test.mjs`.

## Mobile / web client (`src/server/`) — BET-559: web client retired

Node HTTP+WS server that runs **on the Linux box** (no SSH hop). BET-559
retired the web/PWA client that used to be served from `mobile/www/` (the
React renderer built by `npm run build:mobile`) — the box no longer serves a
web client. The native iOS client lives in `mobile/native` (Swift). The
renderer (`src/renderer/`) is the DESKTOP Electron app only.

**Server modules:**
- `tmux.mjs` — tmux list/CRUD/config (pure, testable; `parseSessions` is
  exported for tests)
- `pty.mjs` — node-pty spawn registry keyed by projectName. `spawnRawPty`
  used by the `/pty` WS path; `spawn` used by the RPC `pty:spawn` channel
- `opencode.mjs` — opencode HTTP proxy to `127.0.0.1:4096` (no SSH layer).
  `subscribeEvents` reconnects silently with 1.5s backoff
- `events.mjs` — in-process `createBus()` + `GET /events` SSE endpoint
- `rpc.mjs` — `POST /rpc/<channel>` dispatch; `buildHandlers({tmux,oc,pty,bus,local})`
  maps all `window.api` channels
- `local.mjs` — git worktrees, fs listing, JSON-file-backed config
  (`~/.manta/config.json`). Desktop-only concepts (Mac clipboard, mosh,
  scp peek) are documented no-ops
- `status.mjs` — ports `src/main/status.ts` activity poller; same BUSY_RE /
  subagent regexes, runs locally, publishes `WindowStatus[]` batches on bus

**`window.api` shim** (`src/renderer/api/httpApi.ts`): implements the full
`Api` contract over `/rpc` + `/events`. Installed in `main.tsx` only when
`window.api` is absent (Electron preload not loaded). Server base read from
`localStorage["manta_server"]`.

**Trust mode (chatAutoAllow)**: the opencode pump in `index.mjs` reads
`configGet()` per `permission.asked` event and auto-replies "always" when
enabled — mirrors `src/main/index.ts` opencodeBusLoop. Config file is
`~/.manta/config.json`; atomic writes (temp-rename pattern).

**Auth (M1, live since 2026-07-02).** manta-server enforces
`Authorization: Bearer <box_token>` on EVERY data route (`/rpc`, `/events`,
`/pty`, `/api/*`, `/push/*`) — `src/server/auth.mjs`, gate wired in
`index.mjs`. Only `/auth/pair` (loopback-only mint), `/auth/claim`, and
`/hook/<token>` are exempt. Token store: `~/.manta/auth.json` (0600).
Devices pair via a 6-digit one-time code (`curl -s
http://127.0.0.1:8787/auth/pair` ON the box, then enter the code in the
device's pairing screen); rollout runbook in `docs/auth-enforcement-rollout.md`.
Escape hatch: `MANTA_AUTH_DISABLED=1` (temporary only). **GOTCHA — the
MantaUI-native opencode tools (`docs/opencode-tools/*.ts`) must send this Bearer
header too**: each tool's `boxToken()` reads `~/.manta/auth.json` directly
(same box, same user) per call. When the gate first shipped the tools had no
auth plumbing and EVERY tool call failed "unauthorized" — if you add a new MantaUI
tool, copy the `boxToken()`/`authHeaders()` helpers, or it will 401.
Browsers can't set headers on WS/EventSource, so `/events` + `/pty` (ONLY)
also accept `?token=`. Default bind `127.0.0.1:8787`. Internet access is a
**named Cloudflare tunnel on QUIC**, run by **systemd --user** on the box
(`dev@157.90.224.92`), surviving reboots via `loginctl enable-linger dev`:

- `~/.config/systemd/user/manta-server.service` → `node src/server/index.mjs`
  (`MANTA_MOBILE_HOST=127.0.0.1`, port 8787).
- `~/.config/systemd/user/manta-tunnel.service` (`Requires=manta-server`) →
  `cloudflared tunnel --config ~/.cloudflared/config.yml run manta`.
- Permanent URL: **https://app.mantaui.com** (named tunnel
  `6cdca2ea-…`, zone `mantaui.com`). Stable across restarts — the iOS
  PWA install stays valid.
- Manage: `systemctl --user {status,restart} manta-tunnel manta-server`;
  logs `journalctl --user -u manta-tunnel`.

**QUIC, not http2.** The old `--protocol http2` quick-tunnel buffered SSE
(`/events` connected but streamed zero bytes → UI never updated). The
named tunnel uses `protocol: quic` in `~/.cloudflared/config.yml`, which
streams SSE correctly (verified 2026-05-17, cloudflared 2026.5.0). The
earlier "QUIC fails on this box" note was stale and is retired — do not
reintroduce `--protocol http2`.

**WS protocol** (`/pty?session=NAME&window=N&cols=&rows=`): unchanged.
Client→server: `{type:"data",data}` or `{type:"resize",cols,rows}`.
Server→client: raw PTY bytes.

**Upload endpoint** (`POST /api/upload?session=NAME`): unchanged layout
(`~/.manta-uploads/<session>/<batch>/<file>`).

**Capacitor wrapper** (`mobile/`): Android APK + iOS scaffold. `npm run apk`
in `mobile/` builds the debug APK. `mobile/sync-web.sh` runs `build:mobile`
to refresh `mobile/www/`.

**Mobile-native shell (RETIRED — BET-559):** the React drill-down shell
previously in `src/renderer/mobile/` (`SessionListScreen` →
`SessionScreen`, `MobileApp.tsx`) is gone. BET-559 retired the web/PWA
client it belonged to; neither `src/renderer/mobile/` nor the `.mobile`-
scoped `mobile/mobile.css` exists any more, and `main.tsx` renders `<App/>`
only. The native iOS client lives in `mobile/native` (Swift).

**Reshaping shared components for mobile (RETIRED — BET-559):** the
`.mobile`-scoped CSS approach and the `manta-*` hook classes below applied
to the web/PWA client that BET-559 retired and the `src/renderer/mobile/`
shell it rendered — `mobile/mobile.css` no longer exists. BET-578 stripped
the inert `manta-*` hooks this guidance used to recommend as precedent
(`manta-session-toolbar`, `manta-stale-full`/`-min`, `manta-ctx-track`,
`manta-session-branch`); do not reintroduce `manta-*` classes as mobile CSS
hooks (see the "Mobile CSS hook-class contract — RETIRED" section).

## Desktop transport (HTTP-only)

The desktop Electron app no longer uses SSH to reach the box. Everything goes
over direct HTTPS to manta-server, authenticated with a `boxToken` obtained during
the pairing flow. No tunnels, no ControlMaster, no mosh.

**Pairing → credentials:**
1. User installs MantaUI on Mac, opens the app → full-screen onboarding modal.
2. Enters the 6-digit pairing code (from `manta-pair` on the box or the
   self-install script output).
3. Desktop POSTs `<serverUrl>/auth/claim { code }` → server validates, returns
   `{ boxId, boxToken }`. Desktop persists `{ serverUrl, boxId, boxToken }` to
   `config.json` (`src/main/auth.ts`, `claimPairing`).
4. All subsequent HTTP calls include `Authorization: Bearer <boxToken>`.

**Transport layer:**
- `src/main/index.ts` owns all IPC handlers. Each channel (`schedule:*`,
  `secrets:*`, `webhook:*`, `sharedConfig:*`, `push:*`, `notify:*`, etc.)
  routes to a `src/main/<module>.ts` client that does a plain `fetch` to
  `<serverUrl>/api/<path>` with the Bearer token.
- `src/renderer/api/httpApi.ts` implements the full `Api` contract for the
  renderer: `/rpc/<channel>` for method calls, `EventSource` to `GET /events`
  for SSE streaming. Same Bearer token auth.
- `window.__mantaPreload` (from `src/preload/`) provides OS-integration bridges:
  `peekRemoteFile` (file peek), `getPathForFile` (drag-drop paths), clipboard
  access, screenshot detection, native file dialogs. These are Electron-only
  and have no mobile equivalent.

**What this replaces:** the old SSH `-L` tunnels (`-L 14096:127.0.0.1:4096` for
opencode, `-L 18787:127.0.0.1:8787` for presence/schedules/secrets). The
ControlMaster socket (`/tmp/bui-cm-*`), `forwardHeal.ts`, `runSshOnce`,
`ensurePresenceForward`, and all scp-based file transfer are gone. The server
IS the box — local execution, no hop.

**Config schema (post-pairing):**
```json
{
  "serverUrl": "https://app.mantaui.com",
  "boxId": "<32-hex-char>",
  "boxToken": "<32-hex-char>",
  "projects": [{ "tmuxSession": "...", "defaultCwd": "..." }]
}
```
Legacy SSH fields (`host`, `user`, `identityFile`, `transport`) are migrated
out on load (`src/main/config.ts`).

**Mode detection:** if `boxToken` is set → HTTP mode (normal). No fallback to
SSH — the old `host`-based mode is fully removed.

## Auto-rename (session titles) — BET-1018

When `autoRenameSessions` is on, a chat-mode window gets its **first name on
its first turn** from opencode's own session title **when opencode has one**
(`GET /session`, read via `opencodeListSessions(cwd)` → `findSessionTitle`).
A manta-created chat session is created with an EMPTY title, and opencode does
NOT title it from the first message (verified live, 1.18.10) — so for a fresh
window that title is "". The first-name path therefore **falls through to the
title agent** (`opencodeGenerateTitle`) so the first turn still produces a
sensible rename instead of keeping the creation-time first-word placeholder.
If generation also fails/times out the effect retries on the next turn; never
blank a window name.

Subsequent **re-titles** (every `AUTO_RENAME_EVERY_N_TURNS` = 5 turns) run on
opencode's **"title" agent** (`agent:"title"` in `generateSessionTitle`'s
prompt_async body in `src/server/opencode.mjs`) — its own cheap naming model,
not our main model — returning a clean short name. `sanitizeGeneratedTitle`
stays as a safety net on both paths.

**DO NOT add structured output to that prompt_async call.** Passing
`{"format":{"type":"json_schema",…}}` is ACCEPTED on opencode 1.18.10, but
opencode defaults `retryCount` and its own reader then rejects the whole
session's message list with a permanent HTTP 400 — the entire transcript
becomes unreadable, not just that one message. See the code comment at
`generateSessionTitle`.

Do not change `AUTO_RENAME_EVERY_N_TURNS` (cadence is a separate concern) and
do not delete the throwaway-session mechanism (it's still how drift-tracking
re-titles work — the session title is first-name-only and never updates).

## Web Push notifications (`src/server/push.mjs`)

Mobile gets native push (APNs via the gateway) for events it can't otherwise
see when backgrounded: `permission.asked`, `question.asked`, `session.error`
(always), and `session.idle` → "done" (only if the session was busy AND not
being watched). The **server** decides whether to surface a notification, so
suppression logic lives in `classifyPushEvent` / `firePush`.

- **EVERY notification title is the session's `workspace / session-name`**
  (tmux session / window name), resolved by `firePush` via
  `buildSessionLabel(projects, sid)` over `tmux.listProjects()`. The lookup
  runs for the four notifying types only (`permission.asked`, `question.asked`,
  `session.error`, `session.idle`) — never for the streaming-event firehose.
  The kind-specific context moves to the BODY, and each kind falls back to its
  old descriptive title when the session isn't found in tmux.

- **One notification per event (BET-1044).** Each opencode event arrives on
  BOTH the global stream and the per-directory scoped one. `firePush` drops an
  event whose id it has already seen via the shared `createSeenIdFilter`
  (`src/server/seenIds.mjs`, the same filter `streamInterp.mjs` uses), so a
  `session.error` notifies once, not twice.

- **Cross-device routing = desktop presence + mobile focus (Discord rule).**
  The desktop Electron app POSTs `/push/desktop-presence` direct HTTPS to
  manta-server (`<serverUrl>/push/desktop-presence`, `Authorization: Bearer
  <boxToken>`) every 30s, forever, while it runs. It reports raw observations
  only — `{idleSeconds, lockedSeconds}` — with **all policy on the server**:
  - **`desktopPresence.ts` only measures.** `idleSeconds` is system-wide input
    idle (`powerMonitor.getSystemIdleTime()`); `lockedSeconds` is how long the
    screen has been locked (null when unlocked). Window **focus is NOT an
    input** — Manta's normal pattern is to start a turn then work in another
    app on the same Mac, and a focus-based rule would call that "away" and buzz
    the phone while the user sits in front of the machine. System-wide input
    idle correctly reports "present" there (Slack/Teams measure system input,
    not their own window's focus). Reporting forever also means "app open but
    user idle" is never mistaken for "app quit" — the server's TTL notices a
    real quit within ~90s.
  - **The server turns those into ONE away instant.** `computeAwayAt` merges
    the idle threshold (`IDLE_AWAY_MS` = 10 min) and the lock threshold
    (`LOCK_AWAY_MS` = 5 min) into a single epoch instant with `min()` — the two
    are one calculation, **not two timers**, so a machine that locks after 2
    minutes crosses at lock+5min and the idle+10min rule doesn't fire
    separately. `desktopState` then answers present / away / gone: *gone* = no
    heartbeat within `PRESENCE_TTL_MS` (90s), *away* = past `awayAt`, *present*
    = otherwise.
  - The informational-tier router: `present` → desktop now + **defer** the
    mobile push (parked until the user leaves the desk or the notification goes
    stale at 30 min — never delivered to a phone in the user's hand); `away` →
    desktop now + mobile now (the Mac is open, so the desktop notification is
    there on return); `gone` → mobile only. The old flat 90s escalation timer is
    replaced by one parked list + one 30s poller (`flushDeferredMobile` /
    `startDeferredMobilePoller`), re-evaluated against the live `awayAt` — no
    rescheduling as that instant moves. A lower incoming `idleSeconds` heartbeat
    means "the user came back" and cancels all parked mobile pushes; a session
    resuming / its ask being answered cancels by session. Invariant: the phone
    receives at most ONE delivery per notification.
  - **Blocking tier (permission/question/error/urgent notify) is unchanged:**
    both devices immediately, mobile suppressed only when the phone is
    foregrounded on that same session. Do not touch it.
  - **EXCEPTION — `MessageAbortedError` never pushes.** `classifyPushEvent`'s
    `session.error` branch returns `null` for `MessageAbortedError` (user abort
    or the queued-message drain). Do NOT regress: the name-check is the server's
    only signal. Regression test in `src/server/push.test.mjs`.
  - Observability: the server logs `[push] desktop-presence idle=…s locked=…`
    on each heartbeat and `[push] route kind=… sid=… → desktop=… mobileNow=…
    deferMobile=…` on every decision — the load-bearing way to diagnose routing
    in production. Keep them.

## Scheduled prompts — MantaUI-native AI tool (`src/server/schedule.mjs`)

The first **MantaUI-native opencode tool**: the remote AI can schedule a prompt to
run later (once or on a recurring cron) in the SAME chat session. Full design +
the reusable "MantaUI tools" pattern (for future tools like `ping`) is in
`docs/manta-tools-scheduler.md`. Key facts:

- **The AI's awareness comes from a GLOBAL opencode custom tool**, not MantaUI code.
  `docs/opencode-tools/schedule.ts` is **COPIED** (not symlinked) into
  `~/.config/opencode/tools/schedule.ts` on the box — **alongside the shared
  `manta-auth.ts` module** it imports
  (`docs/opencode-tools/manta-auth.ts` → `~/.config/opencode/tools/manta-auth.ts`);
  opencode auto-loads it for
  EVERY project/session/model. Multiple named exports → tools `schedule_create`,
  `schedule_list`, `schedule_cancel`. A guidance blurb appended to
  `~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md` (from `docs/opencode-tools/AGENTS.md`) tells the
  model when to reach for it. **DO NOT symlink the tool** — opencode resolves a
  tool's imports relative to the file's REAL path, so a symlink back into the
  repo (no `node_modules`) fails with `Cannot find module '@opencode-ai/plugin'`
  and the tool silently never registers; a real copy resolves the import up the
  tree to `~/.config/opencode/node_modules/`. **Install/update requires
  `systemctl --user restart opencode-serve`** (opencode runs as that systemd
  service, NOT a `manta-opencode` tmux session — that reference is stale) so it
  re-scans `tools/`.
- **The tool is a thin registrar** — it `fetch`es manta-server
  (`127.0.0.1:8787/api/schedule`, same box, no SSH hop) and returns immediately.
  `execute` must NOT sleep; the durable store + firing loop live server-side.
- **Server-owned + durable.** Jobs in `~/.manta/schedule.json` (atomic
  writes). `startSchedulePoller` ticks every 30s (`createScheduler`, outbox-
  poller shape: inFlight guard + `timer.unref()`), fires due jobs via
  `oc.sendPrompt({sessionId, text})` — the scheduled turn streams into the
  user's open ChatPanel. Survives Mac-app-close / session-nav / reboot (systemd
  + linger). Strictly more durable than Claude Code's session-scoped `/loop`.
- **Cron is interpreted in box-LOCAL time.** `cronMatches`/`validateCron` are
  pure (5-field, `* / - ,`, DOW 0/7=Sun, vixie either-match for DOM+DOW). The
  model converts NL→cron itself. `lastFiredMinute` (minute-key) dedups within a
  minute and means **no catch-up** for minutes missed while the box was off
  (fire-once-when-due, like Claude Code). v1 has **no jitter / no 7-day
  expiry** (single-user, one box).
- **Management UI**: `ScheduledTasksCard` in `ChatPanel.tsx` (pinned card above
  the composer, modeled on `PermissionCard` — a card, NOT a footer item, so it
  renders on desktop AND mobile with no mobile-CSS edits). Opened by the
  `⏰ schedules` button in `SessionToolbar` (desktop) or the `Scheduled tasks`
  item in the mobile `⋯` sheet (`SessionScreen.tsx`), which dispatches a
  `manta-open-schedules` window CustomEvent (the sheet is outside ChatPanel —
  mirrors the `manta-scroll-to-question` bridge). **Freshness is refetch-driven**
  (open + 10s open-poll), NOT a bus event: desktop's renderer isn't wired to the
  server's in-process bus, so a `schedule.updated` event would only reach
  mobile. manta-server still publishes `schedule.updated` (cheap) for a future
  mobile optimization, but the UI does not depend on it. `describeCron` in
  `chatUtils.ts` (pure, tested) renders human-readable cadence.
- **Transport: `schedule:*` channels, NOT `opencode:*`** — schedules are a
  MantaUI-SERVER concept. Desktop reaches the server store over direct HTTPS
  (`<serverUrl>/api/schedule`, `src/main/schedule.ts`, mirrors
  `sharedConfigSync`); mobile is in-process (`src/server/rpc.mjs` →
  `schedule.mjs`). If the server is down, list/delete shows an error toast
  but jobs **still fire** (server-owned). `window.api.scheduleList`/
  `scheduleDelete` wired across all 6 sites (types, preload, httpApi, main
  handler, rpc dispatch, impls).
- Tests: `src/server/schedule.test.mjs` (cron + tick, 20) and `describeCron` in
  `chatUtils.test.ts` (10). Pure logic only.

## Serve page — MantaUI-native AI tool (`src/server/servePage.mjs`)

The second **MantaUI-native opencode tool**: the remote AI can publish a standalone
HTML page to a public URL so it's reachable from anywhere (esp. the machine
running the MantaUI UI). Built for design previews / demos / mockups that opencode
generates on the box. Follows the same "MantaUI tools" pattern as the scheduler
(`docs/manta-tools-scheduler.md`). Key facts:

- **Global opencode tool**, `docs/opencode-tools/serve-page.ts`, **COPIED** (not
  symlinked — same `@opencode-ai/plugin` import-resolution gotcha as schedule)
  to `~/.config/opencode/tools/serve-page.ts`, **plus the shared `manta-auth.ts`
  module it imports** (`→ ~/.config/opencode/tools/manta-auth.ts`). Three named exports → tools
  `serve_page`, `stop_page`, `list_pages`. Guidance appended to
  `~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md` from `docs/opencode-tools/AGENTS.md`.
  **Install/update = `systemctl --user restart opencode-serve`.**
- **Thin registrar** — `fetch`es manta-server `127.0.0.1:8787/api/serve-page`
  (same box, no SSH hop), returns the public URL immediately. No long-running
  work in `execute`.
- **Server-owned + durable.** Registry in `~/.manta/serve-page.json`
  (atomic writes). Source file is **COPIED** at register time into
  `~/.manta/pages/<subdomain>/index.html` (stable snapshot — survives
  `/tmp` cleanup; updating = re-call `serve_page` with the same subdomain).
- **Served from manta-server itself, on a path, under the box's own
  published hostname.** Public URL shape is
  `https://<gateway_host>/pages/<subdomain>` (e.g.
  `https://0123abc.boxes.mantaui.com/pages/preview`). The hostname is the
  one Caddy already reverse-proxies to `127.0.0.1:8787` for the SPA, with an
  automatic LE cert — nothing new to provision. `gateway_host` is read fresh
  per call from `~/.manta/auth.json` via `publicBaseUrl()` in
   `gatewayRegister.mjs`. **Resolution order (BET-349):** a Tailscale-mode
   box's tailnet `serverUrl` in `~/.manta/ingress.json` wins, because a
   tailnet box still registers with the gateway (for the APNs token) so it
   HAS a `gateway_host` even though nothing listens on it — that hostname is
   not evidence of public reachability; otherwise `gateway_host` from
   `~/.manta/auth.json`; else `registerPage` fails loudly with a clear
   error — never hands back a URL that would silently 404 (BET-343).
- **Sandbox CSP is load-bearing.** Pages now share an origin with the SPA
  (which keeps the box_token in localStorage), so the response carries
  `Content-Security-Policy: sandbox allow-scripts allow-forms allow-popups
  allow-modals` — *without* `allow-same-origin`, so the page lives in an
  opaque origin and its scripts cannot read that storage or send
  credentialed same-origin requests. Response headers also include
  `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`, and
  `Cache-Control: no-store`. See `pageResponseHeaders()` in
  `src/server/servePage.mjs` (test pins the absence of `allow-same-origin`).
  `/pages/...` is auth-exempt in `isExemptPath` — the box hostname itself is
  a 128-bit unguessable label, and a visitor by definition holds no token.
- **`isValidSubdomain`** (1-63 lowercase alphanumeric + hyphen, no
  leading/trailing hyphen) is the path-traversal guard: the route handler
  validates the slug against it before touching the filesystem, so a crafted
  `/pages/../etc/passwd` can never escape `~/.manta/pages/`. Sub-paths
  (`/pages/a/b`) → 404 JSON. The validator is also used as the registry
  key, so every persisted subdomain is a safe single path segment.
- **TTL expiry** (default 24h, `ttlHours:0` = never). `startCleanupPoller`
  sweeps every 5 min (`createCleanupSweep`, injectable load/save/now, inFlight
  guard + `timer.unref()`), `rm`-ing expired page dirs. `stop_page` deletes
  immediately. `readPage()` (exported, I/O-injectable) also prunes a registry
  entry whose on-disk file is missing — page dir may have been deleted
  externally or swept — matching the file-server behaviour this replaced.
- **No UI card (v1).** Unlike the scheduler there's no ChatPanel management
  card yet — the AI lists/stops via the tools.
- **No extra port, no separate file server, no Host-header routing, no
  wildcard DNS record.** All of that was the old design (BET-343 replaced
  it). The 127.0.0.1:20080 listener is gone; the `*.pages.<domain>` Caddy
  block, OVH DNS-01 wildcard cert, and wildcard A-record on the prod zone
  are retired out-of-band (manual maintainer step, not part of any PR).
- Tests: `src/server/servePage.test.mjs` (`isValidSubdomain`, `pageUrl`,
  `registerPage` empty-`baseUrl` guard, `readPage` prune-on-missing,
  cleanup-sweep expiry, `pageResponseHeaders` CSP invariant). Pure logic
  only — no live HTTP.

## Peer awareness — MantaUI-native AI tool (`src/server/peers.mjs`)

The third **MantaUI-native opencode tool**: an opencode session can see what OTHER
sessions in the SAME workspace are doing AND send them messages. Use case: an
agent notices files / `git status` changing under it and wants to know which
other agent is working alongside it (so they don't collide), or wants to
coordinate / hand off work to a peer. Same "MantaUI tools" pattern as
schedule/serve-page (`docs/manta-tools-scheduler.md`). Key facts:

- **Workspace = tmux session (MantaUI project); peers = sibling windows.** The crux
  is the `@manta-session-id` tmux user-option, surfaced by `tmux.listProjects()`
  as `window.opencodeSessionId`. `resolveWorkspace(projects, sessionID,
  directory)` (pure) finds the caller's window — by sessionID first, falling
  back to a `paneCurrentPath === directory` match (covers subagent children
  whose window isn't stamped). `selectPeers` returns the sibling windows.
- **Global opencode tool**, `docs/opencode-tools/peers.ts`, **COPIED** (not
  symlinked — same `@opencode-ai/plugin` gotcha) to
  `~/.config/opencode/tools/peers.ts`, **plus the shared `manta-auth.ts` module
  it imports** (`→ ~/.config/opencode/tools/manta-auth.ts`). Three exports → `peers_list`,
  `peers_inspect`, `peers_message`. Guidance appended to
  `~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md`.
  **Install/update = `systemctl --user restart opencode-serve`.**
- **Thin registrar** — `fetch`es manta-server (no SSH hop). `peers_list` /
  `peers_inspect` GET `/api/peers?sessionID=&directory=[&target=]` (`target`
  present → inspect one; absent → list all). `peers_message` POSTs
  `/api/peers {sessionID, directory, target, message}`. No durable state: peer
  data is computed live per call; messaging is fire-and-forget into the peer's
  session.
- **Per-peer data sources branch on window type:**
  - chat-mode peer (`opencodeSessionId` set): `oc.listMessages` transcript +
    `listPermissions`/`listQuestions`. Status via `classifyChatStatus`
    (blocked-question > blocked-permission > working [last assistant turn has
    no `time.completed`] > idle — best-effort, the server keeps no live
    running flag). Activity via `describeChatActivity` (in-progress todo →
    last assistant snippet → recent tool names).
  - claude-TUI peer (`opencodeSessionId` null): `tmux capture-pane -S -40` +
    `BUSY_RE` (copied from status.mjs — no coupling). `capture-pane` is BLANK
    for chat-mode holder panes (`sleep infinity`), which is exactly why the
    branch exists.
  - git state (both): `git -C <cwd> status --porcelain` (`parseGitStatus`,
    pure) + `oc.getVcsBranch(cwd)`. The uncommitted-file count is the headline
    "another agent is touching files" signal.
- **`peers_list`** → each peer's name, type, branch, gitChanges count, status,
  one-line activity. **`peers_inspect(target)`** (by window name / index /
  session id) → full git file list + branch, plus recent transcript turns +
  todos (chat) or terminal pane tail (TUI).
- **`peers_message(target, message)`** → injects `message` as a new user turn
  into the target peer's opencode session via `oc.sendPrompt`. Chat-mode peers
  ONLY — a claude-TUI peer (`opencodeSessionId` null) has no session to inject
  into and is rejected. `sendPeerMessage` resolves the target the same way as
  `inspectPeer` (name / index / session id), then wraps the body with
  `formatPeerMessage` (pure) so the RECEIVER sees a `[Message from peer agent
  session "<name>" in workspace "<ws>"]` prefix — the cross-session origin is
  explicit and the receiver is told to reply via `peers_message`. The receiving
  side needs no code: the wrapped text arrives as an ordinary user turn through
  the normal SSE path. Guidance in `docs/opencode-tools/AGENTS.md` tells every
  session it may receive such messages.
- **No UI card, no durable store, no bus event** — purely a live AI-facing
  read + message tool (v1). No `peers:*` window.api channels; the desktop
  renderer doesn't consume it.
- **Tool descriptions + the AGENTS.md blurb are deliberately cost-aware and
  anti-reflex** (rewritten after a session called `peers_list` at task start and
  needlessly woke an unrelated peer). Each `execute` is a read/wake with a token
  cost — `peers_inspect` reads a transcript, `peers_message` WAKES a peer and
  warms its (possibly stale) context. The guidance therefore forbids reflexive /
  "situational awareness" use and requires CONCRETE present evidence of a
  file-level collision (or an explicit user ask) before calling; questions
  answerable from `git`/`gh`/CI/fs ("is main green?", "what shipped today?") must
  NOT trigger a peer call. If you regenerate these descriptions, KEEP the cost
  warning + the anti-pattern list — the naive "run peers_list first" framing is
  what caused the waste.
- Tests: `src/server/peers.test.mjs` (resolveWorkspace, selectPeers,
  parseGitStatus, summarizeTranscript, classifyChatStatus, describeChatActivity,
  recentTurns, formatPeerMessage, sendPeerMessage — 20). Pure logic only.

## Notifications + the `notify` tool (`src/server/push.mjs`)

The fourth **MantaUI-native opencode tool** and the first with a **desktop OS
notification leg** alongside the existing mobile Web Push. Full design +
routing matrix + scenarios in `docs/manta-tools-notify.md`. Key facts:

- **manta-server is the SINGLE notification router.** Every notification —
  automatic opencode event (`firePush`) OR an AI `notify` call (`fireNotify`) —
  runs through the pure `routeNotification(payload, presence, now)` in
  `push.mjs`, which decides desktop / mobile / both / escalation knowing BOTH
  device presences. This is what guarantees **no duplicates**: one place sees
  everything. It SUBSUMES the old "suppress mobile done while active on desktop"
  rule (that's now just one row of the matrix).
- **Two transports, one router.** Mobile leg = Web Push (unchanged). Desktop leg
  = `setDesktopSink(fn)` (injected by `index.mjs`) publishes a `desktopNotify`
  bus envelope; the Electron app (`src/main/desktopNotify.ts`) consumes
  manta-server's `GET /events` SSE **over direct HTTPS to manta-server**,
  relays the payload via `IPC.desktopNotify` → the renderer (`App.tsx`
  `onDesktopNotify`) shows it with the `Notification` API. The desktop ignores
  every other bus `kind` (it already gets opencode events from its own :4096
  stream — re-consuming would double).
- **The "am I viewing this session?" suppression is client-side on desktop.**
  The server routes desktop-vs-mobile; the renderer does the final suppression
  (focused AND `activeChatSessionId === payload.sessionId`) because it knows its
  active session locally — no need to plumb it to the server. Mobile's
  equivalent stays server-side (`/push/focus`) because a push can't be unsent.
- **Tiers (Slack/Discord parity).** `notifTier`: **blocking**
  (permission/question/error, or `notify` with `urgent:true`) → every device
  now, no delay. **informational** ("done", normal `notify`) → desktop-first
  ladder.
- **Cross-device routing (desktop-first, then deferred mobile).** The desktop
  reports raw observations (idle + lock) every 30s; the server merges the idle
  (10 min) and lock (5 min) thresholds into ONE away instant via `computeAwayAt`
  (a single `min()`, not two timers) and classifies `desktopState` as
  present/away/gone (`PRESENCE_TTL_MS` = 90s). Informational tier: `present` →
  desktop now + **defer** mobile (parked in `_deferredMobile`, delivered on a
  30s `flushDeferredMobile` poll once away/gone, dropped stale after 30 min);
  `away` → desktop now + mobile now; `gone` → mobile only. **Cancel** the parked
  push when: a heartbeat reports lower `idleSeconds` (`setDesktopPresence` →
  `cancelAllDeferredMobile`), the session resumes / its ask is answered
  (`cancelDeferredMobileForSession` from the busy/reply branches in `firePush`),
  or a same-`tag` re-notify supersedes. The phone receives at most ONE delivery
  per notification.
- **Blocking tier is unchanged:** both devices immediately, mobile suppressed
  only when the phone is foregrounded on that same session.
- **The `notify` tool** (`docs/opencode-tools/notify.ts`, COPIED to
  `~/.config/opencode/tools/` plus the shared `manta-auth.ts` module it imports,
  restart `opencode-serve`) is a thin registrar →
  `POST /api/notify {message, title?, urgent?, sessionID}` → `fireNotify`.
  Session-tied: carries `context.sessionID` so it deep-links + dedupes
  (`tag:"notify-<sid>"`). The model does NOT pick the device — the router does.
- **No UI card (v1).** No `notify:*` window.api channels — it's AI-facing +
  server-routed. DND/quiet-hours deferred to v2.
- Tests: `src/server/push.test.mjs` — `routeNotification` matrix (present /
  away / gone × blocking / informational), `computeAwayAt`/`desktopState`, and
  deferred flush/cancel/supersede. Pure logic only.

## Secrets — MantaUI-native AI tool (`src/server/secrets.mjs`)

The fifth **MantaUI-native opencode tool**: a secure key→value store so the user can
hand a secret (a GitHub PAT, an API key…) to a working agent WITHOUT the value
ever entering the AI transcript. Same "MantaUI tools" pattern as schedule/serve-page/
peers/notify. Key facts:

- **THE INVARIANT: the store NEVER returns a value to the agent.** A secret
  leaks the instant its value lands in the agent's context (a tool result, a
  command the agent types, or command OUTPUT it reads). So `secret_list` returns
  NAMES + hints only, and `secret_provide` MATERIALIZES the value to a 0600 file
  on the box and returns ONLY the path. The agent uses it by reference —
  `git push https://x-access-token:$(cat <path>)@github.com/…` — so the value is
  substituted by the shell at run time and never printed. There is deliberately
  **no `secret_get` and no `secret_set` tool**: storing is a HUMAN action via the
  UI (else the value would route through the transcript).
- **Two namespaces.** `shared` (every session) + `session` (scoped to one
  opencode `sessionID`; a session-scoped key SHADOWS a shared key of the same
  name for that session). `visibleSecrets` / `resolveSecret` (pure, tested)
  implement the resolution; session wins over shared.
- **Global opencode tool**, `docs/opencode-tools/secrets.ts`, **COPIED** (not
  symlinked — same `@opencode-ai/plugin` gotcha) to
  `~/.config/opencode/tools/secrets.ts`, **plus the shared `manta-auth.ts` module
  it imports** (`→ ~/.config/opencode/tools/manta-auth.ts`). Two exports → `secret_list`,
  `secret_provide`. Guidance appended to `~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md` from
  `docs/opencode-tools/AGENTS.md` (## MantaUI secrets). **Install/update =
  `systemctl --user restart opencode-serve`.**
- **Thin registrar** — `fetch`es manta-server (no SSH hop). `secret_list` GETs
  `/api/secrets?sessionID=`; `secret_provide` POSTs `/api/secrets/provide
  {key, sessionID}` → `{path, key, hint}`.
- **Server-owned + durable.** Store `~/.manta/secrets.json` (atomic write,
  chmod 0600). Materialized value files under `~/.manta-secrets/` (dir 0700, files
  0600): shared → `<key>`, session → `sessions/<sessionID>/<key>`. `deleteSecret`
  also removes the materialized file so a deleted secret can't be re-read off
  disk.
- **UI card**: `SecretsCard` in `ChatPanel.tsx` (pinned card above the composer,
  modeled on `ScheduledTasksCard` → renders desktop AND mobile, no mobile-CSS
  edits). Opened by the `🔑 secrets` button in `SessionToolbar` (desktop) or the
  `Secrets` item in the mobile `⋯` sheet (`SessionScreen.tsx` → `manta-open-secrets`
  window CustomEvent). The card has an add/edit form (key + value [type=password]
  + scope + hint) and a metadata-only list (the value is cleared from component
  state on save and never re-displayed). Refetch-driven (open + 10s poll).
- **Transport: `secrets:*` channels** (mirror schedule's). Desktop reaches the
  server store over direct HTTPS (`<serverUrl>/api/secrets`,
  `src/main/secrets.ts`); mobile is in-process (`src/server/rpc.mjs` →
  `secrets.mjs`). `window.api.secretsList/secretsSet/secretsDelete` wired across
  all 6 sites. **list returns metadata only**; the value travels renderer → box
  on set and never comes back.
- **Migration**: `scripts/migrate-secrets.mjs` consolidates secrets scattered in
  credential files (gh `hosts.yml`, `~/.aws/credentials`, `~/.netrc`,
  `~/.modal.toml`) into the store. LEAK-SAFE: it runs on the box, reads each
  source locally, and POSTs the value straight to manta-server — values NEVER pass
  through the AI transcript (the script prints only key names + sources). Dry-run
  by default; `--apply` to import. Canonical credential files are left untouched.
- Tests: `src/server/secrets.test.mjs` (isValidKey, visibleSecrets shadowing,
  resolveSecret precedence, materializedPath, CRUD round-trip, provideSecret
  writes 0600 + returns path-not-value — 21). Pure/IO-injected logic only.

## Background delegation — MantaUI-native AI tool (`src/server/delegate.mjs`)

The sixth **MantaUI-native opencode tool**: the remote AI can kick off a
long-running task in a BACKGROUND opencode session (its own git worktree +
chat-mode tmux window) so the main conversation is NOT blocked, and the
result is delivered back as a separate later message when the job finishes.
Same "MantaUI tools" pattern as schedule/serve-page/peers/notify/secrets
(`docs/manta-tools-scheduler.md`). Key facts:

**TERMINOLOGY — "subagent" means three different things, and conflating them
sends you to the wrong half of the codebase.** All three are colloquially "a
subagent"; only the third one is this section.

| Term | Started by | Surface | Owns |
|---|---|---|---|
| **inline subagent** | the `task` tool (foreground) | the TRANSCRIPT — collapsed card, expand for the child's turns (see "Subagent rendering") | nothing: no tmux window, no worktree, no branch, and **no sidebar row, ever** |
| **backgrounded subagent** | the `task` tool with `background: true` | a nested SIDEBAR ROW under the session that started it | its own opencode session + tmux window, but **no worktree** |
| **background job**, a.k.a. **delegated subagent** | the `delegate` tool | a nested SIDEBAR ROW under the session that started it | its own opencode session, tmux window, git worktree + branch |

All three coexist deliberately (the model picks per task) and nothing about
one implies the other. So "delegated subagents don't show in the rail" is a
bug report about THIS section, while "inline subagents don't show in the
rail" is very likely someone looking at `task` children run in the
foreground, which are working as designed — they never get a row. A
backgrounded subagent and a background job DO both get a rail row now; the
difference between those two is the worktree. When writing user-facing copy
prefer **"background job"** for the `delegate` kind — the rail row, branch
and worktree all belong to it.

- **Global opencode tool**, `docs/opencode-tools/delegate.ts`, **COPIED** (not
  symlinked — same `@opencode-ai/plugin` gotcha) to
  `~/.config/opencode/tools/delegate.ts`, **plus the shared `manta-auth.ts` module
  it imports** (`→ ~/.config/opencode/tools/manta-auth.ts`). Three exports → `delegate`,
  `delegate_list`, `delegate_stop`. Guidance appended to
  `~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md` from `docs/opencode-tools/AGENTS.md`
  (## MantaUI background delegation). **Install/update =
  `systemctl --user restart opencode-serve`.**
- **Thin registrar** — `fetch`es manta-server (no SSH hop). `delegate` POSTs
  `/api/delegate {prompt, model?, sessionID, directory}` → `{ok, id, job}`;
  `delegate_list` GETs `/api/delegate?sessionID=`; `delegate_stop` POSTs
  `/api/delegate/:id/stop`. `execute` returns promptly; the engine owns the
  lifecycle.
- **Three-way mode selection is the model's choice.** `delegate`'s
  description steers it: use the built-in `task` tool in the foreground when
  you need the answer before you can continue, or with `background: true`
  for long independent work that will not edit files; use `delegate` when
  the work WILL edit files, since it is the only one that gets its own git
  worktree and branch (see the TERMINOLOGY table above). Every job costs a
  full extra model session, so the description forbids speculative fan-out
  and nested jobs.
- **The "you do NOT have the result yet" return string is load-bearing.**
  `delegate` returns immediately with the job's name + id and an explicit
  reminder that the result is NOT available yet and will arrive as a later
  message — the model must not report or guess the job's findings before
  then (this is the exact bug Claude Code had to fix). Do not soften it.
- **Server-owned engine** (`src/server/delegate.mjs`, dependency-injected
  pure logic + injected I/O, mirrors `capabilities.mjs`): startJob creates a
  worktree → new chat-mode window (stamps `@manta-session-id`) → records the
  job `running` → injects the opening prompt. Completion is detected from
  the opencode event firehose via `observeEvent` (first idle AFTER a seen
  busy, per-job `sawBusy` flag — stops a stray pre-prompt idle completing the
  job instantly). `finishJob` assembles the result (last assistant text +
  `filesChanged`) and delivers the completion to the parent session through
  the shared prompt-delivery engine (`src/server/promptDelivery.mjs`), which
  defers until the parent is idle so a notice never aborts the parent's turn.
- **Cap of five concurrent `running` jobs** box-wide (`MAX_RUNNING_JOBS`);
  a sixth is refused with a clear error (do not retry). No `queued` state —
  a job either starts immediately or is refused. Running jobs older than 30
  min become `failed "timed out after 30 minutes"` (sweeper). Terminal jobs
  retained 7 days or 50 records, whichever bites first; the window +
  worktree are NEVER removed by the sweeper — only by an explicit delete.
- **No `peers`-style status/inspect tool here** — background jobs are
  ordinary sibling sessions, so `peers_inspect` already covers "what is that
  job doing", and the tool description says so. `delegate_list` is for
  answering a user's "what's running?" question, not for waiting (do NOT
  poll).
- Jobs appear in the sidebar as ordinary sessions (their own window).
- Tests: `src/server/delegate.test.mjs` (startJob undo-on-failure,
  nesting/cap refusal, observeEvent completion ordering, finishJob result
  assembly, buildJobPrompt/buildCompletionText, sweep retention, stop/delete
  — pure/IO-injected logic only, no live HTTP/tmux).

## App control — MantaUI-native AI tool (`src/server/appControl.mjs`)

The seventh **MantaUI-native opencode tool**: an opencode session can drive
the app the user is looking at — switch the model for its chat session, rename
the session in the sidebar, compact it, or list the sessions in its workspace.
Same "MantaUI tools" pattern as the other six (`docs/manta-tools-scheduler.md`).
This ticket is the server half + tool registrar; the sibling ticket (BET-841)
consumes the bus envelopes in the renderer.

- **Global opencode tool**, `docs/opencode-tools/manta-app.ts`, **COPIED** (not
  symlinked — same `@opencode-ai/plugin` gotcha) to
  `~/.config/opencode/tools/manta-app.ts`, **plus the shared `manta-auth.ts` module
  it imports** (`→ ~/.config/opencode/tools/manta-auth.ts`). Four exports → `manta_compact_session`,
  `manta_switch_model`, `manta_rename_session`, `manta_list_sessions`. Guidance
  appended to `~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md`. **Install/update =
  `systemctl --user restart opencode-serve`.**
- **Thin registrar** — each `execute` POSTs `/api/app-control {action,
  sessionID, directory, ...args}` (same box, no SSH hop) and returns promptly.
  The `boxToken()` / `authHeaders()` helpers are copied verbatim (every `/api/*`
  route is behind the bearer gate). Dispatch on `action`; unknown actions are
  rejected by name with a message the model can act on, never a bare 500.
- **Session resolution** — every action resolves the caller's window the way
  `peers.mjs` does, via the shared `resolveWorkspace` (sessionID first, then a
  `paneCurrentPath === directory` fallback). No second resolver. Pure logic,
  injected I/O, no durable store — a live claim, computed per call.
- **The four actions:**
  - `compactSession` — calls the existing `oc.compactSession`. `{ok:true}`;
    no bus event (opencode already emits `session.compacted` and the renderer
    reacts).
  - `switchModel({query})` — resolves the query against `oc.listModels()`
    with the shared fuzzy matcher `fuzzyMatchModel` (moved to
    `src/shared/modelGuide.mjs`; `suggestModels` powers the no-match error that
    names the closest candidates for a retry). On a hit publishes `{action:
    "switch-model", sessionId, providerID, modelID}`. **The model override is
    renderer state** (per-session `localStorage`), so the server can't apply it
    directly — the bus event is how it lands on the open ChatPanel.
  - `renameSession({name})` — validates (1–40 chars, no `:` or control chars),
    calls `tmux.renameWindow` (never shells out directly), publishes `{action:
    "rename-session", sessionId, name}` so sidebars refresh without a poll.
  - `listSessions` — read-only windows in the caller's workspace: name, index,
    chat-mode flag, branch (best-effort), and whether it's the caller. No event.
- **Bus** — ONE kind, `appControl`, with an `action` discriminator (not one
  kind per action). Published through the existing bus in `index.mjs` as
  `{kind:"appControl", payload}`; the renderer needs exactly one listener + one
  switch. Payload is client-agnostic so the native client can adopt it later.
- **Out of scope by design**: interrupt/abort of the current turn and
  permission/question approval are NOT available through these tools — the
  tool descriptions and guidance say so explicitly.
- Tests: `src/server/appControl.test.mjs` (session resolution by id and
  directory fallback, model fuzzy match + no-match candidate error, rename
  validation accept/reject, unknown-action rejection, bus payload shape for
  both publishing actions — pure/injected only, no live HTTP/tmux).

## Manta Optimizer (`src/server/optimizer/`) — phase 1 shipped, phase 2 in flight

The optimizer makes a paid plan last longer: it trims dead weight out of a
conversation's history, paces spending against the quota windows that actually
reset, compacts long-idle conversations before the user comes back to them, and
folds all of that into the model router's existing cost stage. **Phase 1
(BET-1332, merged) is OBSERVE-ONLY and always on**; phase 2 (BET-1346) is what
actuates, and it is gated behind ONE user-facing switch.

**Metrics are always on; actuation is not.** With the switch off the box still
measures everything — the ledger read model, the masking counterfactual, the
quota-window forecast, the measured cache TTL — so the dashboard has real
numbers to show BEFORE the user ever turns anything on. That asymmetry is
deliberate: an optimizer that can only prove its value after you trust it never
earns the trust.

**Phase 1 surface (shipped):**
- `optimizer:summary` (`src/server/optimizer/summary.mjs`) — a memoized (60s,
  in-flight-guarded) read model over the opencode message ledger. Degrades to
  `{supported:false}` on a box with no Node 24 / no `opencode.db`, exactly like
  `modelLedger`.
- `counterfactual.mjs` + `POST /api/optimizer/counterfactual` — the
  observe-mode masking store. A report REPLACES a session's entry (each report
  is the full would-mask for that history, never an increment).
- `forecast.mjs` — quota-window observation history + forecast-at-reset, tapped
  at the usage poller's single publish point.
- `ttl.mjs` — the measured effective prompt-cache TTL, and the verifier that
  compares it against what opencode is CONFIGURED to send.
- `OptimizerCard` in Settings → Models; the visual spec is committed at
  `docs/optimizer/mockup.html` and is the artifact the UI is implemented
  against, not a screenshot taken afterwards.

**The switch (phase 2): "Manta optimized token usage", Settings → Models,
DEFAULT OFF.** It replaces the three-way routing-preset control, and it gates
ONLY the phase-2 behaviours. **It does NOT gate Auto routing.** Routing
activation is `modelRouting.preset`, which the server defaults to `"balanced"`
(`src/server/local.mjs`), so every box has routing active today; wiring the new
switch into `routingActive()` would silently turn Auto OFF for everyone the
moment the default-off switch shipped. The preset config key is retained and
pinned at `"balanced"` precisely so that cannot happen — what used to be the
`economy` preset is now reached dynamically through the eco level below.

**The one user override is the model pick.** The existing manual-pick-beats-Auto
contract is the whole override surface: no per-knob editing, no reset buttons,
no approval queue. Changes that could affect answer quality ship inside their
own guardrails (constraint-retention checks, re-fetch-churn limits) rather than
behind a human confirmation, and the activity log is the trust surface —
including the entries where the optimizer rolled its own change back.

**Nothing phones home.** There are no fleet priors and no shared telemetry of
any kind; every parameter the tuner learns is learned from this box's own
history and stays on it.

## Mouse mode — design decision, do not re-litigate

**Mouse is ON through the whole pipeline (tmux + claude).** This matches what
claude does in a native terminal: wheel scrolls claude's conversation,
drag-select goes to claude.

A previous design tried to turn mouse OFF in both tmux and claude so xterm.js
could own selection and drag-select wouldn't snap. That broke wheel-scroll
inside the claude TUI: xterm.js falls back to wheel→arrow keys in alt-screen,
and claude treats up/down as prompt-history navigation. Claude even surfaces
this with a "Scroll wheel is sending arrow keys · use PgUp/PgDn to scroll"
hint, which is its way of telling you mouse forwarding is broken.

Do NOT reintroduce:
- `tmux set -g mouse off` overrides at attach time.
- `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_MOUSE=1` in the claude launch command.
- xterm.js parser handlers that swallow DECSET 1000/1002/1003/1006 enables.

If a user reports drag-select "snapping to bottom" while *in shell scrollback*
(not the claude TUI), the culprit is usually a tmux `copy-pipe-and-cancel`
binding on `MouseDragEnd1Pane`. `-and-cancel` exits copy mode, which snaps
the viewport. That's a tmux-side rebinding (e.g. `copy-pipe-no-clear` plus
`set-clipboard external`), not a MantaUI-side override. The claude TUI itself
does not enter tmux copy mode for drags — claude has its own mouse tracking
and tmux passes through.

## Tmux config approach — drop-in, no surprises

MantaUI does NOT modify `~/.tmux.conf` automatically. Settings shows config
status read-only; `tmuxSetupConfig` exists but is opt-in via UI only.
Backup at `~/.tmux.conf.pre-MantaUI` on the remote if it was ever modified.

## State

- **Source of truth**: tmux on the remote. `tmux list-sessions` + `list-windows -a`.
- **Local config** (`<userData>/config.json`): `{serverUrl, boxId, boxToken, projects[{tmuxSession, defaultCwd}], chatAutoAllow, defaultModel, skillRegistryUrls, cacheTtl}`.
- **No local sessions table.** Project = tmux session, app session = tmux window.

## Patterns worth knowing

- **New window / new chat-session cwd inheritance** — every code path that
  creates a tmux window or an opencode session resolves the cwd through ONE
  helper, `resolveProjectCwd(sessionName, inputCwd)` in `buildHandlers`
  (`src/server/rpc.mjs`). It is the SOLE resolver — HTTP-only means there is no
  longer a desktop-main copy (the old `src/main/index.ts` duplicate was deleted
  with the SSH path). Applied by all four consumers: `tmux:new-session`,
  `tmux:new-window`, `opencode:fork-session`, `opencode:clear-session`.
  Precedence (BET-120): **explicit non-tilde cwd → stored project `defaultCwd`
  in config → LIVE tmux session dir (`listProjects()` first-window pane path) →
  `"~"`** as last resort. The live-tmux fallback matters because the stored
  config (`~/.manta/config.json` `projects[]`) is only populated by the
  desktop project-create flow and is empty/stale for sessions created any other
  way — without it, every new window silently dropped into `$HOME`. **Renderer
  must pass `cwd ?? ""`** (or omit it), NOT `cwd || "~"` — the literal tilde
  would defeat the resolver. Tests: `src/server/rpc.test.mjs` covers empty /
  tilde / explicit / stored-meta-precedence / live-tmux-fallback.
  - **GOTCHA — opencode does NOT reject a tilde dir; it silently corrupts
    it.** `resolveProjectCwd` deliberately returns a possibly-tilde path
    (`~/projects/x`) — it picks *which* cwd, not an absolute one. opencode's
    `session.create` requires an absolute directory and resolves a
    tilde-relative one against its OWN server process cwd (the remote
    `$HOME`), persisting the corrupt `/home/<user>/~/projects/x` into session
    metadata forever. Expansion is therefore mandatory at the **single
    creation chokepoint**, NOT in `resolveProjectCwd`: `createSession`
    (`src/server/opencode.mjs`) expands a leading `~` itself via `expandTilde`
    (from `src/shared/paths.mjs`) against the server process's own `$HOME` —
    the renderer (desktop + mobile) reaches it the same way over `/rpc`.
    `forkSession` is unaffected — it inherits the parent's directory from
    opencode and passes no cwd. Regression tests:
    `createSession expands a leading ~ …` in `src/server/opencode.test.mjs`
    (red/green verified). Do NOT "simplify" by moving expansion back into a
    caller — the chokepoint is what makes the corruption unreachable.
  - **GOTCHA — tmux does NOT expand `~` either; it silently falls back to
    `$HOME`.** `tmux new-window -c '~/foo'` and `tmux new-session -c '~/foo'`
    BOTH accept the literal tilde but resolve it against the tmux server's
    own cwd (typically `$HOME`) and exit code 0 — silently landing every
    project created with the UI's default `~` cwd in the home directory.
    This is the BET-307 tmux-side chokepoint: `tmux.mjs`'s
    `resolveCwdOrThrow` is the single place a caller-supplied cwd becomes a
    real directory handed to tmux or opencode. It expands `~` via the
    shared `expandTilde` (now living in `src/shared/paths.mjs` — three
    copies used to live in `tmux.mjs`, `opencode.mjs` and `pluginManifest.mjs`,
    all deleted) and rejects a missing directory with a loud error before
    any tmux call (and before any orphan opencode session is created in
    chatMode). Applied at exactly three sites: `newSession`, `newWindow`,
    and the exported `newWindowGetIndex` (which `rpc.mjs:363` calls
    directly for fork-session). Regression test: `resolveCwdOrThrow` cases
    in `src/server/tmux.test.mjs` + the `node -e` e2e in BET-307. Do NOT
    "simplify" by passing the cwd through unchanged — the chokepoint is
    what makes the silent `$HOME` fallback unreachable.
- **HTTP 500-body contract (BET-1460) — classify every route by CONSUMER
  before writing its error catch.** The contract is set by who reads the
  body, decided once in BET-1460 and enforced by
  `src/server/errorBodyContract.test.mjs`:
  - **Class 1 — the 500 body can reach an END USER's screen** (chat panel
    attachment chips, the CTO pane's toasts and load-error states, the iOS
    composer). The body must be a SAFE HUMAN LITERAL and the underlying
    error goes to `console.warn` server-side: write the 500 ONLY through
    `respondSafe500(res, route, message, e)` from `src/server/safeApiError.mjs`
    (the CTO family shares `CTO_SAFE_500_MESSAGE`; `/api/upload` is extracted
    into `src/server/uploadRoute.mjs` on the `projectsRoute.mjs` pattern).
    Never write `String(e?.message ?? e)` into a class-1 body — raw fs
    paths and errno output on a user's screen is the leak BET-1454 fixed.
  - **Class 2 — consumed only by an AI tool registrar / automation /
    operator surface** (manta-native opencode tools relay the message
    straight back to the model; the cap runner; Settings renders raw only
    behind a `<details>` disclosure). Keep the raw body and put a
    `// class-2 (BET-1460): …` marker comment on the catch — the gate test
    asserts every remaining raw 500 carries one. Meaningful 400-class
    bodies ("unknown action", "unauthorized") are untouched by this rule on
    BOTH classes.
  When adding a route, decide the class first; a class-1 conversion needs
  the safe literal + warn, a class-2 route needs the marker comment.
- **Queued message drain — abort at the next step boundary, then submit on
  idle.** When the user submits while `running` is true, the text gets pushed
  to `messageQueue` and the input clears. MantaUI does NOT wait for the whole
  (possibly many-step) turn to finish: the moment a prompt is queued, the
  next mid-turn **step boundary** triggers a **drain-abort**
  (`maybeDrainQueuedPrompt` in ChatPanel, gated by `shouldAbortForQueuedDrain`
  in `chatUtils.ts`) — `window.api.opencodeAbort` on the in-flight turn. The
  abort flips the session idle, and the existing `[running, messageQueue]`
  effect submits the queued prompt as a fresh turn via `submit()` (so slash
  commands, attachments, and model resolution all go through the normal path).

  **What counts as a "step boundary" — a COMPLETED TOOL PART, not
  `session.next.step.ended`.** This is THE fix for "queued prompt waits for
  the whole turn" (2026-06-19). The deployed opencode build does NOT emit the
  `session.next.*` event family AT ALL — verified live by streaming `/event`
  during a multi-tool turn: you only get `message.part.delta`,
  `message.part.updated`, `session.status` (busy/idle), and a final
  `session.idle`. The original trigger hooked onto `session.next.step.ended`
  therefore never fired, so the drain silently fell back to full-idle. The
  primary trigger is now a `message.part.updated` whose `properties.part` is a
  `tool` part at `state.status === "completed" | "error"`
  (`isToolStepBoundary`, pure + tested). The legacy `step.ended` block still
  calls `maybeDrainQueuedPrompt` as a harmless fallback for any build that
  DOES emit it (the helper is idempotent via `drainAbortRef`). If you ever see
  the drain regress to "waits for whole turn", FIRST re-verify which events
  opencode emits — do not assume `session.next.*` works.

  The abort is made INVISIBLE to the user:
  - `drainAbortRef` is set when the drain-abort POSTs. It guards re-entrancy
    (several boundary events can arrive before the abort lands — only the
    first fires) AND tags the resulting `MessageAbortedError`.
  - The `session.error` handler swallows that error silently via
    `isDrainAbortError(err.name, drainAbortRef.current)` — no `sendError`
    banner. It just flips `running` false (safety net if `session.idle`
    doesn't also fire) so the drain effect runs.
  - The drain effect re-arms `drainAbortRef = false` before submitting, so a
    SECOND queued item can again abort the freshly-submitted turn at its next
    step boundary (FIFO, each interrupting at a tool boundary).

  This REPLACES the older "drain ONLY on `session.idle`, never mid-turn"
  rule. That rule existed because posting a prompt mid-turn WITHOUT a
  preceding explicit abort makes opencode abort implicitly, surfacing a
  `MessageAbortedError` banner + marking the assistant message aborted. The
  fix is the explicit abort + `isDrainAbortError` suppression — NOT avoiding
  mid-turn sends. Do NOT reintroduce an `idle`-only drain; the suppression
  path is what keeps the swap clean. The partial assistant output generated
  before the abort legitimately stays in the transcript (real work the model
  did); only the abort *error/indication* is hidden. The predicates are pure +
  tested in `chatUtils.test.ts`. ChatPanel is shared with mobile, so this
  behavior applies on both transports (both implement `opencodeAbort`).

  **The drain effect is the SOLE owner and lives in `useSseBus.ts` — do NOT
  duplicate it.** The BET-64 hook extraction left an IDENTICAL
  `[running, messageQueue]` drain effect in BOTH `useSseBus.ts` AND
  `ChatPanel.tsx`. Both fired on the same `running→false` edge against the
  shared `messageQueue` + `submitRef`, submitting the same queued prompt
  **TWICE** ("queued message sent twice"). The ChatPanel copy was removed;
  a `no double send` regression test in `useSseBus.test.tsx` guards it.

  **Ordering inside the drain effect is load-bearing:** `setInput(queued)`
  runs synchronously in the effect body, and ONLY the `submitRef.current()`
  call is deferred to `setTimeout(0)`. `submit()` reads `input` from its
  render closure (not a ref), so the deferred submit must run AFTER the
  input-set re-render has reassigned `submitRef.current` to a fresh closure.
  The hook version originally did `setInput(queued); submitRef.current()`
  BOTH inside the timeout back-to-back — no re-render gap — so submit read
  the stale empty input and **silently dropped the queued prompt**
  (a contributor to "queued messages seem to wait / never send"). Do NOT
  collapse `setInput` back into the timeout next to the submit call.
- **TodoWrite checklist auto-dismissal** — when every item in the pinned
  `ActiveTodos` is terminal (`completed` or `cancelled`) at the moment the
  user submits their next prompt, `todosDismissed` flips true and the card
  hides until opencode emits a fresh `todo.updated`. Without this, finished
  checklists stayed pinned forever and read as "still active work". The
  `allTodosTerminal()` predicate lives in `chatUtils.ts` (tested); the
  dismissal state is local to `ChatPanel`. Reset triggers: session change,
  any incoming `todo.updated`. Do NOT clear on idle/`session.idle` —
  the user keeps the visual confirmation right up to their next turn.
- **Model persistence across sessions** — model selection is per-session in
  `localStorage` (`manta:chat:<sessionId>:model`). On `/clear`, the handler
  captures the returned `newSessionId` and copies the current override into
  the new key before calling `refresh()`. `modelOverride` initial state falls
  back to `AppConfig.defaultModel` (from store) when no localStorage entry
  exists, so new sessions pick up the global default automatically.
- **One PTY per active project**, kept mounted across renders. Switching
  between sessions inside a project uses `tmux select-window` over the
  local tmux socket (no PTY reconnect).
- **OSC 52 → Mac clipboard** via custom parser handler in `Terminal.tsx`
  (xterm.js's built-in addon-clipboard doesn't work in Electron because
  `navigator.clipboard.writeText` is gated on user gesture).
- **ResizeObserver skips fit when container is hidden** (< 50px). Without
  this, switching projects re-flows scrollback at min width.
- **Active-effect resize dance** (`Terminal.tsx`) does wide-then-narrow on
  re-activation to un-wrap lines cramped while hidden. Don't simplify this;
  a naive shrink-then-restore doesn't actually coalesce wrapped lines.
- **Shift+Enter → newline** in `Terminal.tsx`. xterm.js routes input through
  a hidden textarea; the browser default for Shift+Enter there is to insert
  `\n`, which the inner claude TUI then receives as submit. We catch the
  event in `attachCustomKeyEventHandler`, call `preventDefault()` to kill
  the textarea side, and manually `ptyWrite("\x1b\r")` — the same sequence
  iTerm2's `/terminal-setup` sends. Don't drop the `preventDefault()`.
- **Chat transcript pin-to-bottom — one explicit "following" state, not
  derived from the live scroll position (BET-933).** BET-679 moved the
  transcript to react-virtuoso; the v1–v4 hand-rolled machinery
  (`pinnedToBottom`, `prevScrollHeight`, `wasAtBottomBeforeCommit`,
  `classifyScrollForPin`) is gone. This issue removed Virtuoso's
  `followOutput` / `atBottomStateChange` / `atBottomThreshold` because
  `followOutput` reacts only to item-COUNT changes and therefore missed
  every height change (tool cards as their output streams, streaming text,
  the Footer's working indicator), silently detaching the transcript
  mid-turn with no user input — and staying detached for the rest of the
  turn.

  The replacement is one explicit follow state owned by ChatPanel
  (`followingRef` + its render mirror), turned OFF only by a scroll gesture
  that moves UP (`classifyFollowOnScroll`, threshold in
  `FOLLOW_THRESHOLD_PX`), and one auto-follow trigger
  (`totalListHeightChanged` → `scrollElementToTail`). Content growth fires
  no scroll event, so it can never flip the state.

  **State the invariant plainly, because five generations of this code have
  now got it wrong: never derive "should we follow" from "is the scroller
  at the bottom". Content growing under the user changes the latter and
  must not change the former.**

  **A scroll event is not a user gesture either — that was generation six.**
  A `scroll` event with a lower `scrollTop` was read as "the user dragged
  up", but react-virtuoso writes to the scroller itself: its *upward
  scrolling compensation* fires whenever a row above the viewport is
  re-measured (plus the unshift/`deviation` corrections). A tool card
  landing mid-turn re-measures its row, Virtuoso compensates, and the
  transcript detached with no user input at all — the "every tool call
  bounces me out and I have to click jump-to-latest" report. So the two
  signals are now separate: WHERE the scroller is (the scroll event) and
  WHETHER the user put it there. `classifyFollowOnScroll` takes a
  `userIntent` argument and only returns `false` when both agree; intent is
  a short window (`USER_SCROLL_INTENT_WINDOW_MS`) refreshed by wheel /
  touch / keydown on the scroller, plus a held-pointer flag. Landing within
  `FOLLOW_THRESHOLD_PX` of the bottom still re-attaches unconditionally.

  **Pointer intent is "a button is held", NOT "the press landed on the
  scrollbar" — the geometric test is a no-op on the primary platform.** The
  obvious discriminator is `clientX > left + clientWidth` (the gutter the
  scrollbar reserves). That works with classic scrollbars and never fires
  under **overlay** scrollbars, the macOS default, where the bar is painted
  OVER the content and `clientWidth` is the full border-box width — so a
  Mac user could not detach by dragging the scrollbar at all, while Windows
  could. Measured in headed Chromium (the probe is worth re-running before
  changing this): classic reports `clientWidth` 385 / `offsetWidth` 400,
  overlay reports 400 / 400, and BOTH dispatch `pointerdown` to the scroller
  at the same `clientX`. In the same run every scroll of a thumb drag fired
  with the button held and a plain content click fired none — so the button
  state separates them in both modes. A press that never scrolled earns
  nothing on release (`releaseUserScrollIntent`), which is what stops a
  tool-card click from vouching for the compensation its own expansion
  causes; a press that DID scroll earns the normal window, covering a quick
  track click whose scrolls land after the release.

  Two consequences worth knowing before editing this:
  - **A programmatic scroll away from the tail must now detach EXPLICITLY.**
    `scrollToMessage` (the artifacts / ⌘F deep-link jump) calls
    `setFollowing(false)` itself; it used to rely on the resulting scroll-up
    being mistaken for a gesture, which is exactly the mistake being fixed.
  - **`stickToTail` writes twice, across a frame.** Virtuoso publishes
    `totalListHeightChanged` synchronously inside the ResizeObserver tick,
    while the list padding carrying part of that height is React state that
    lands on a later commit — so the first write can read a pre-growth
    `scrollHeight` and park short of the tail. The rAF write lands on the
    real one. Both are guarded on the follow state.

  Note the tail scroll is `scrollTop = scrollHeight`, not
  `scrollToIndex({ index: "LAST" })`, because the Footer renders below the
  last item.

## New-project dialog (`Sidebar.tsx`)

Two helpers run on the server via `local.listWorktrees(cwd)` and
`local.listPathCompletions(cwd)` (HTTP `POST /rpc/local` → `src/server/local.mjs`),
both executed locally on the Linux box. No SSH hop — the server IS the box.

- **`listWorktrees(cwd)`** — `git worktree list --porcelain` in the given cwd.
  If >1 worktree, the dialog pauses to show "Detected N git worktrees.
  Open a session for each?" with Yes / Just main. On Yes, the first
  worktree becomes the tmux session's initial window; the rest are added
  as new windows. Each window's `cwd` is the worktree's own path.
- **`listPathCompletions(cwd)`** — `ls -1Ap <parent> | grep '/$'`.
  Powers the shell-style ghost-text autocomplete in the cwd input.

Locked decisions for these flows:

- **Window names use the worktree directory basename**, not the branch.
  Antoine's worktree folders are already named meaningfully
  (`ethernal`, `ethernal-marketing`); branch names lose that context.
  See `worktreeName()` in `Sidebar.tsx`. Don't "fix" this back to branch.
- **Autocomplete is shell-LCP, not first-match.** Single match → suggest
  full path + `/` (so the next Tab descends). Multiple matches with a
  longer common prefix → suggest the LCP only (never commit to one
  ambiguous sibling). No suggestion when typed is already the LCP. The
  reducer is in `refreshCwdSuggestion()`.
- **Ghost-text rendering trick**: the wrapper `<div>` carries the
  background + border, the `<input>` is `bg-transparent`, and an
  absolute-positioned overlay sits between them with the typed prefix in
  `invisible` and the suggestion tail in `text-text-faint`. Both input
  and overlay use `font-mono` so the invisible prefix and the muted
  tail align character-for-character with the caret. If you change the
  font on one, change both — or alignment drifts a pixel per character.
- The fan-out flow only fires on project create. There's no live
  re-sync if worktrees come and go later (same scope as the "live
  refresh polling" roadmap item).

## Per-window activity poller (`src/server/status.mjs`)

Runs **on the server** (the Linux box), not on the desktop. Polls every 2s via
local `tmux list-windows -a` + `tmux capture-pane -p -S -40` for every window,
then parses the captured text. No SSH hop — the server IS the box. Publishes
`WindowStatus[]` batches on the in-process bus; the desktop consumes them over
`GET /events` SSE.

Detection rules — these are **heuristics over Claude's TUI rendering**, not
a contract. They will break the next time Claude rewords its status line:

- **Running** (`BUSY_RE`): a line matching
  `^[✻✳✶✽✢·*]\s+\S+…[^\n]*\([^)\n]+·[^)\n]*\)` — spinner glyph + verb with
  Unicode ellipsis + parens-with-`·`. The `^` anchor matters: assistant
  messages and code blocks are always indented, so a chat reply that quotes
  `✻ Ruminating… (10s · ...)` does not match.
- **Done** (no match): same line becomes `✻ Cogitated for 39s` — past
  tense, no ellipsis, no parens. Requiring `…` is what distinguishes live
  from done.
- **Subagents**: `^●\s+Task\(` lines whose next ⎿ child within 3 lines is
  `⎿  Running…`. Other tool calls (Bash, Read, etc.) also briefly render
  `⎿  Running…` but they don't get counted because their parent header is
  not `Task(`. Column-0 anchor again — same self-reference trap.

If the indicator goes dark across all windows after a Claude update, dump
`tmux capture-pane -p -S -40 -t <session>:<idx>` while a window is busy and
compare against the regexes. The bottom of an alt-screen has the spinner
~10 lines above the input box, so a naive tail-line check misses it; the
regex matches anywhere in the captured body.

**Chat-mode windows are NOT served by this poller.** Their tmux pane runs
`sleep infinity` (the holder); `capture-pane` returns blank output, BUSY_RE
can't match, so the poller would silently report `running:false` forever
for chat windows. Sidebar status for chat-mode flows through a separate
path: an `onOpencodeEvent` subscription in `App.tsx` calls
`setChatRunning(sessionId, running)` on `session.status` / `session.idle`
and `setChatAttention(sessionId, kind)` on `question.asked` /
`permission.asked` / `*.replied` / `*.rejected`. `applyStatusBatch`
preserves chat windows' prior status across poller ticks (looking up
`w.opencodeSessionId`) so the poller never clobbers the live SSE state.
Attention kinds: `"idle"` (running→idle while user wasn't on the window,
amber dot), `"question"` (Question tool blocked the turn, pulsing red
dot + `?`), `"permission"` (permission.asked blocked a tool, pulsing red
dot + `!`). `chatAutoAllow` suppresses `permission.asked` at the bus
layer in both transports, so the sidebar naturally stays quiet in trust
mode.

## Chat-mode windows

A second window type alongside the claude-TUI window. A tmux window running
`sleep infinity` (holder pane) with MantaUI's own React `ChatPanel` overlaid on
top, talking to an opencode session over HTTP (via manta-server).

**Recognition**: presence of `@manta-session-id` tmux user-option on the window
is THE signal the renderer uses to show `ChatPanel` instead of `Terminal`.

**Conversation search (⌘F, BET-698) is ONE server-side SQLite query** over
opencode's own store (`src/server/messageSearch.mjs` → `opencode:search-messages`),
scoped to exactly the chat windows in the sidebar and covering each one's FULL
history. The renderer (`src/renderer/SearchPalette.tsx`) holds no search logic —
it sends `{ query, sessionIds }` (active session first, then every other chat
window in sidebar order) and renders the flat returned hits grouped by session.
This replaced the old client-side transcript-not download fan-out (which capped
at 5 sessions per keystroke) and fixed the current-conversation tail-only gap. It
requires the **Node 24 box runtime** (`node:sqlite`); on an older box the channel
degrades to `{ supported:false }` and the palette shows "update the box". The DB
handle is read-only, always.

**Architecture** (HTTP-only — opencode session mgmt + SSE live server-side):
- opencode runs as a `systemd --user` service (`opencode-serve`) on the Linux
  box, port 4096, bound to 127.0.0.1. manta-server proxies it over HTTP
  (`src/server/opencode.mjs`) — no SSH tunnel, no `-L` forward.
- Renderer never talks to opencode directly — only via `window.api.*`, which is
  `httpApi` (`/rpc` + `/events`) on both desktop and mobile.
- **manta-server** owns the opencode SSE streams (`src/server/opencode.mjs`
  `subscribeEvents` — global + one scoped `/event?directory=` stream per known
  session directory) and republishes on its in-process bus; the renderer
  consumes them via `GET /events`. ChatPanel filters by sessionID. (Historical:
  the desktop main process used to own this SSE bus via `src/main/opencode.ts` +
  `src/main/index.ts` over an SSH forward — that path is deleted.)
- Anthropic auth via `opencode-claude-auth@latest` plugin in
  `~/.config/opencode/opencode.jsonc` (Claude Max sub, `~/.claude/.credentials.json`).

**Key files**:

| File | What |
|---|---|
| `src/server/opencode.mjs` | opencode HTTP proxy, session mgmt, per-directory SSE streams (server-side, the sole owner) |
| `src/server/tmux.mjs` | tmux CRUD, `restampSessionId` (`@manta-session-id`), chat-holder pane, `maybeCreateChatSession` |
| `src/server/rpc.mjs` | `/rpc` channel dispatch — the `window.api` contract, server side; `resolveProjectCwd` |
| `src/server/index.mjs` | manta-server entry: `/rpc`, `/events` SSE, REST `/api/*`, WS `/pty`, auth gate |
| `src/renderer/api/httpApi.ts` | the live `window.api` on desktop + mobile (`/rpc` + `/events`) |
| `src/renderer/ChatPanel.tsx` | entire chat UI (~2285 LoC), intentionally monolithic |
| `src/renderer/App.tsx` | mounts ChatPanels keyed by session id; owns the `onOpencodeEvent` fan-out |

**AppConfig additions**: `opencodePort` (default 14096), `chatAutoAllow`
(auto-reply "always" to all permission requests — like `--dangerously-skip-permissions`).
`chatAutoAllow` does NOT apply to Question tool requests — those always need
explicit user choice. `defaultModel: { providerID, modelID }` — global default
for all new and cleared sessions; settable in Settings; `null`/absent = opencode
picks its own default. `skillRegistryUrls: string[]` — extra opencode skill
registry URLs (Settings UI), persisted to `~/.manta/config.json` via the generic
`configUpdate` channel.

**opencode.jsonc writes go through exactly two writers (BET-1318).** Upserts go
through opencode's own `PATCH /global/config` (BET-1019) — the writer lives in
`src/server/providers.mjs` (`patchGlobalConfig` → `setProviders` /
`setSubagents`). The endpoint owns both the in-memory config and the file, edits
the `.jsonc` surgically, and **preserves `//` comments** (verified live). Note
`PATCH /config` is INERT on 1.18.x (returns 200 but changes nothing): only
`PATCH /global/config` works. Deletions go through `removeConfigKeys` (surgical
jsonc-parser edit + mandatory opencode restart) — the PATCH endpoint has no
delete semantics over HTTP (it deep-merges and rejects `null`), so a `remove`
op (deactivating a subagent / deleting a provider endpoint / removing a
reference) cannot be expressed through it; the restart is what stops a removed
key resurrecting from opencode's stale in-memory config. There is no third
writer. The default
registry
(`https://antoinedc.github.io/manta-skills`) ships in the opencode binary once
the upstream PR (anomalyco/opencode#28068) lands; these are user-added extras.
`cacheTtl: "5m" | "1h"` — Anthropic prompt cache TTL (default `"5m"`).
Display-only: drives the stale-cache threshold on the SessionHeader context
pill (a stale cache tints that pill warn and shows a Clear-session block in
its popover — there is no separate cache pill; see the "Stale prompt-cache"
section below). MantaUI does NOT set `cache_control.ttl` on any request.
**NOT display-only: it changes the real wire TTL** by writing
`options.cacheControl` into opencode's own config. The default is `"5m"`
because that is what opencode sends when the key is absent, measured. Going
1h→5m RESTARTS opencode and ends in-flight turns; going to 1h does not. See
"Stale prompt-cache" for the wire evidence and the four opencode properties
the implementation depends on.

**v2-only endpoints** (used alongside the v1 base):
- `GET /question` — list pending Question tool requests
- `POST /question/{id}/reply` — body `{answers: string[][]}` (one array of selected
  option labels per question)
- `POST /question/{id}/reject` — dismiss without answering
- `GET /vcs?directory=<cwd>` — `{branch?, default_branch?}` for the session
  cwd. **MantaUI does NOT use this.** opencode caches the branch per-worker and
  its internal watcher misses terminal-side `git checkout`s, so `/vcs`
  returns stale data forever ("main" even when HEAD is on `feature/x`) and
  the `vcs.branch.updated` SSE below never fires for those switches. The
  `opencode:vcs-branch` IPC (`window.api.opencodeVcsBranch(directory)`)
  bypasses opencode entirely: the server spawns
  `git -C <cwd> branch --show-current` locally
  (~30ms); the mobile server uses the same local spawn.
  ChatPanel polls every 5s and on every submit, so terminal-side checkouts
  reflect within one tick. If you ever need branch info elsewhere, use the
  same IPC — never call `/vcs` directly.
- SSE events consumed in ChatPanel's `onOpencodeEvent` handler beyond the
  basics (`session.idle/status/error/compacted`, `message.part.*`, `permission.*`,
  `question.*`):
  - `session.next.step.ended` — live token/cost snapshot. `stepTokens` state
    is preferred over the transcript-scraped `latestTokens` so the
    SessionHeader context pill updates between tool calls, not just on
    re-fetch. `properties.
    finish` is classified via `classifyFinish()` into `"output-cap" |
    "context-wall" | "tool-cutoff" | null` (covers Anthropic `max_tokens` /
    `model_context_window_exceeded`, OpenAI `length`, Gemini `MAX_TOKENS`).
    Non-null results land in `finishByMessageId: Map<messageID,
    TruncationKind>` and render an inline orange `⚠ truncated (…)` pill
    on the matching `MessageRow` next to the turn-duration footer.
    `tool-cutoff` is promoted from `max_tokens` when the message's last
    non-step part is a `tool` — silently-fatal case where the tool JSON is
    incomplete; the badge tells the user a retry is needed. The legacy
    `sendError` banner also fires (finish-aware copy via
    `describeTruncation().label`), without clobbering a more-specific
    `session.error`.
  - `session.next.compaction.{started,delta,ended}` — drives the inline
    `CompactionCard` above the running indicator. `.ended` holds the
    "Compacted" confirmation for 2.5s then clears (the `session.compacted`
    refetch has landed by then).
  - `todo.updated` — `liveTodos` state, preferred over transcript-scraped
    `activeTodos`. Lets the `ActiveTodos` card flip items between
    in_progress/completed live.
  - `vcs.branch.updated` — keeps the branch chip in SessionHeader's left
    group current
    when opencode itself notices a change (rare in practice: its watcher
    misses terminal-side `git checkout`s — see the `/vcs` note above for
    why we don't rely on this event). The handler is still wired because
    when opencode DOES emit it, the value is correct, but the 5s poll +
    submit refetch is the authoritative path. Properties have no
    `sessionID` so the early sessionID filter at the top of
    `onOpencodeEvent` short-circuits (undefined → falsy).
  - On `todo.updated`, `todosDismissed` is reset to `false` so a fresh
    TodoWrite resurfaces the card even if the prior list was user-dismissed.
  - `session.status` with `type === "retry"` — drives the `RetryCard` above
    the running indicator with `attempt`, `message`, and an optional
    `action {title, message, label, link?}`. Cleared on next `busy`/`idle`.
  - `command.executed` — fired right after opencode creates the user
    message that holds an expanded slash-command template. Properties
    `{name, arguments, messageID, sessionID}` populate `commandByMessageId:
    Map<messageID, {name, arguments}>`. `MessageRow` reads the map and
    swaps the user-text gray bar for `UserCommandBar` — a collapsed
    `› ▸ /name args` row with a chevron that expands to the full template
    body. Without this, invoking a large skill (e.g. gsd-*) dumped the
    entire SKILL.md as the user's turn.

The `QuestionCard` component (bottom of `ChatPanel.tsx`) renders above
`PermissionCard`. Each card shows question header + body text, clickable option
buttons (toggleable multi-select when `multiple:true`), an **always-shown**
free-text input ("Or type your own answer…"), and Submit / Cancel. The
free-text box is no longer gated on opencode's `custom:true` flag — the user
can type a custom reply for ANY question (desktop + mobile, since mobile reuses
this component). On submit, typed text is appended AFTER any selected option
labels for that question (`buildQuestionAnswers` in `chatUtils.ts`, pure +
tested), so a picked option and a typed clarification both reach the model;
Enter in the input submits when the whole request is answerable. Submit is
disabled until every question has at least one selection or non-empty typed
text (`canSubmitQuestion`, also pure + tested).

**Pattern: live-event state preferred over transcript-derived `useMemo`.**
The transcript only refreshes on the 300ms debounced refetch — a long tool
roundtrip leaves footers and cards stale until the next part arrives.
Several `useMemo` selectors over `messages` now check a "live" state first
and fall back to the message scan:
- `latestTokens` prefers `stepTokens` (from `session.next.step.ended`)
- `activeTodos` prefers `liveTodos` (from `todo.updated`)
- `branch` is pure state (initial fetch + 5s poll + submit refetch +
  best-effort `vcs.branch.updated`; see `/vcs` note above)
- `finishByMessageId` is pure state (from `session.next.step.ended`'s
  `properties.finish`) — survives refetch because the canonical messages
  payload doesn't carry per-step finish metadata.
- `commandByMessageId` is pure state (from `command.executed`) — same
  reason: the canonical messages payload has no command-origin field, so
  re-fetch can't restore the `/name args` collapsed view.
When adding a new live-event consumer in ChatPanel, follow the same shape:
`useState` reset on session change, set in the SSE handler, consumed via a
`liveX ?? transcript-derived` selector. Don't try to mutate messages
in-place — the canonical refetch will overwrite you.

**ContextBar — lives in the SessionHeader (`SessionHeader.tsx`, the row at
the top of the pane), not the composer footer.** What AGENTS.md calls the
"context bar" is the context pill at the right of the session header: a mini
segmented bar inside the pill plus a larger segmented bar + full breakdown in
its click-to-open popover. The stale-cache warning is part of that same pill
(see below), not a separate element.

**ContextBar denominator is the active model's real `limit.context`**, not
a hardcoded 200k. `resolveContextLimit(activeModel)` reads
`model.limit.context` (Opus 4.7 = 1M, Sonnet 4 = 200k) so the bar reflects
what the provider will actually accept; falls back to `ASSUMED_CONTEXT_TOKENS`
(200k) only when no model is selected yet. Tooltip at ≥90% surfaces
"consider /compact soon"; at 100% says "Compact recommended". If you add
a new place that shows ctx %, use the same helper — don't reintroduce the
200k hardcode.

**ContextBar numerator = input + cache.read + cache.write** (all three
Anthropic input buckets are disjoint and ALL consume the request's context
window). Earlier code used `input + cache.read` and under-counted on
cache-warming turns. Math + per-segment widths live in
`computeContextBreakdown()` in `chatUtils.ts` (tested). The bar is
SEGMENTED: fresh-input slice in the stage color, cache.write slice in
amber (`#f59e0b`), cache.read slice in teal (`#0ea5a4`). (The older mobile-CSS
hiding of the bar via a `span[class*="w-24"]` selector is gone — that
`mobile.css` and the class were retired with BET-559/578; nothing hides the
bar today.)

**Stale prompt-cache — a warn-toned context pill plus a block in its
popover.** There is no separate cache pill in the composer footer any more;
staleness is surfaced entirely by the SessionHeader context pill (BET-415
moved it into the header with the rest of session state). Anthropic's prompt
cache has a sliding TTL (5m default, 1h opt-in via `cache_control.ttl`).
When the session has been idle past the TTL, the next user message re-bills
the entire cached prefix as `cache_creation_input_tokens` (full rate + 25%
for 5m, 2× for 1h). The SessionHeader `ContextPill` (`SessionHeader.tsx`)
renders when stale by flipping its pill tone from neutral to `warn` and, in
the popover, showing a "cache went stale … clearing saves Nk tokens" block
with a **Clear session** button. The warn state matches when:
`!running && idleMs >= ttlMs && cachedTokens >= STALE_CACHE_MIN_TOKENS`
(5k). The TTL is **NOT set by MantaUI** — MantaUI only predicts staleness
from `AppConfig.cacheTtl` ("5m" | "1h", default **"5m"**, in Settings).

**cacheTtl is a REAL setting — it changes what Anthropic is asked for, not
just what the pill predicts (BET-1336).** opencode's `applyCaching()`
(`packages/opencode/src/provider/transform.ts`) stamps its own cache
breakpoints `{type:"ephemeral"}` with **no `ttl` field**, so left alone
Anthropic applies its default 5-minute TTL — measured on the wire:
`usage.cache_creation.ephemeral_5m_input_tokens: 4421`,
`ephemeral_1h_input_tokens: 0`. That is why **"5m" is the default and is
expressed as the config key being ABSENT**.

**"1h" is applied by writing `options.cacheControl` into opencode's own
config**, which opencode turns into a **top-level** `cache_control` on the
request. Verified end-to-end through a real opencode turn (isolated proxy
provider, 1.18.22): `TOP-LEVEL cache_control={"type":"ephemeral","ttl":"1h"}`,
and Anthropic bills the write to `ephemeral_1h_input_tokens`. No beta header
needed. The machinery is `selectCacheTtlTargets` / `planCacheTtlOps` /
`syncCacheTtl` / `readCacheTtl` in `src/server/providers.mjs`, driven from the
`config:update` and `config:get` channels in `rpc.mjs`.

Four properties of opencode's logic that the implementation is shaped around —
change any of them and this breaks:

1. **`cacheControl` is a caching-MODE switch, not a TTL field.**
   `usesAnthropicAutomaticCaching` (gated on `options.cacheControl !== undefined`
   + `@ai-sdk/anthropic`) makes opencode SKIP its own breakpoints and hand
   placement to Anthropic — measured as `block_breakpoints=0` on the wire.
   **So "5m" must REMOVE the key, never write `ttl:"5m"`** — an explicit 5m
   would silently flip every default user into automatic caching. There is
   likewise no "off" value: `null` leaves opencode in automatic mode with no
   `cache_control` on the wire, i.e. no caching at all.
2. **The option is per-MODEL.** `ProviderTransform.options()` does not pass
   provider-level options through, so there is no single global key; the
   setting fans out over the Anthropic-SDK models of the CONNECTED providers
   (15 on a stock Anthropic box). Only `@ai-sdk/anthropic` and
   `@ai-sdk/google-vertex/anthropic` honour it — anything else would be a stray
   option under the wrong providerOptions namespace, so the target set is exact.
3. **Writing hot-applies; removing RESTARTS opencode.** `PATCH /global/config`
   lands in the live config with no restart (verified). A removal has to go
   through `removeConfigKeys`, which restarts `opencode-serve` — otherwise the
   deleted key survives in opencode's in-memory config. That restart **ends
   every in-flight turn box-wide**, so 1h→5m confirms with the user first and
   `syncCacheTtl` reports `restarted` so a caller can say so. (Not theoretical:
   it killed an agent's own turn mid-call during development.)
4. **Reconciliation has a DIRECTION rule.** manta's stored value is the user's
   INTENT, opencode's config is the mechanism. On read (`config:get`), stored
   "1h" with opencode unset is APPLIED (a pure upsert, no restart) — that is
   what carries a user who chose 1h before the setting was wired through.
   Any other disagreement adopts opencode's value into the mirror, because
   resolving it the other way would mean a restart, which a read must never do.

**Still worth fixing upstream**: `applyCaching()` should accept a configurable
`ttl` on the breakpoints it already writes, which would give a real TTL knob
without the mode switch in (1) or the per-model fan-out in (2).

**History note:** BET-1334 deleted this setting and replaced it with a TTL
measured from the message ledger, on the reasoning that it asked users to
guess another program's internals. That reasoning applied to the OLD
display-only control and no longer holds — the control now SETS those
internals rather than guessing them. BET-1336 reverted that removal and wired
the control for real; do not re-remove it without a way for a user to actually
choose a 1-hour cache.

The predicate (`computeStaleCache`), TTL → ms (`selectCacheTtlMs`), and
"last assistant completion" selector (`selectLastAssistantCompletion`)
are pure + tested in `chatUtils.ts`. ChatPanel runs a 10s
`setInterval` (gated on `!running && lastCompleted != null &&
cachedTokens >= min`) to re-evaluate the predicate over time without
remounting; same pattern as the RunningIndicator's 1s elapsed-time tick
but coarser since staleness is a 5-min / 1-hr scale.

**Composer meta row — what it actually owns today.** The composer
(`InputArea.tsx`) below the session header owns COMPOSING only. Its meta
footer row holds: the model picker (model + effort + fast-toggle, inside
`ModelPicker`), the mic and attach buttons (input-mode affordances), and on
the right the usage dial (`UsageDial`) plus the ⏰ schedules / 🔑 secrets /
🪝 webhooks `SessionToolbar` buttons, with a transient voice/running status
string ("transcribing… · esc cancels" / "recording · ⏎ send · ⇧⌘M stop ·
space pause · esc cancel" / "esc · interrupt") appearing while voice or a turn is active.
A trust toggle ("Permissions on — click to bypass" / "Bypassing permissions")
sits on its own row beneath the footer. Status that describes the SESSION
(branch, context pill, stale-cache warning, fork/compact/clear/delete) lives
in the SessionHeader, not here — BET-415's organising split.

**Buffered text-delta streaming.** opencode emits `message.part.delta`
events ~character-by-character for text/reasoning parts. The naive
"setMessages on every delta" policy produces visible markdown jitter:
bullets appear before their content, code fences flash as inline-code
before closing, Prism re-tokenizes a growing code block on every
keystroke. Instead, deltas accumulate in `pendingDeltas: Map<partID,
{messageID, field, text}>` (a ref in ChatPanel) and flush at section
boundaries computed by the pure `findFlushBoundary(buffer)` helper in
`chatUtils.ts`:

- Paragraph breaks (`\n\n`) **outside** an open code block.
- The newline immediately after a closing ` ``` ` fence (so whole code
  blocks appear at once — no half-formed fence rendered as inline code).
- The largest valid boundary wins (deepest flushable prefix).
- 250ms max-age fallback (FLUSH_MAX_AGE_MS) so a single long paragraph
  doesn't stall.

Force-flushed on: `session.next.step.ended` (step narration complete —
flush before next step starts), `message.part.updated` /
`session.idle` / `session.status` / `session.compacted` /
`session.error` / `message.updated` (BEFORE the refetch, otherwise the
canonical-transcript pull races the buffer's max-age timer and the
trailing paragraph gets discarded), and on session change / unmount.

Race tolerance: if a delta arrives before the part's `message.part.updated`
snapshot (so `mergeBufferedDeltas` reports the partID as unmatched), the
flush scheduler triggers `scheduleRefetch()` and the buffered text waits
for the next flush — the refetch creates the part in state, the next
flush merges the buffer cleanly.

Pure logic (`findFlushBoundary`, `mergeBufferedDeltas`) lives in
`chatUtils.ts` with full unit-test coverage including the tricky cases
(open code block suppresses `\n\n` boundaries, empty code block, multiple
fences in one buffer, inline backticks don't toggle fence state).

**Transcript row memoization — REQUIRED for input perf.** The chat
input's `input` state lives in `ChatPanel`, so every keystroke
re-renders the whole component. Without `React.memo` on transcript
rows that cascade re-runs `react-markdown` + Prism for every assistant
message — visibly laggy past ~50 messages. Memoized leaf components:
`MessageRow`, `AssistantPart`, `MarkdownBody`, `CodeBlock`, `ToolCall`,
`ToolOutput`, `ActiveTodos`, `UserCommandBar`. All use the default
shallow comparator; props passed in `messages.map()` are either
primitives or Map lookups from panel-scope `useMemo`s
(`userCommandInfo`, `turnInfo`, `finishByMessageId`, `commandByMessageId`).
**Do not build fresh objects inline inside `messages.map`** — the
`{name, arguments}` cmdInfo literal used to do this and silently
defeated the memo on every keystroke. `userCommandInfo` precomputes
the Map once, the map callback just does an O(1) lookup. If you add
a new prop to MessageRow, either make it primitive or back it with
a memoized lookup; otherwise the keystroke lag returns.

`@`-typeahead file lookup is debounced 80ms (`fileSearchTimer`) so a
fast typist doesn't pile up parallel HTTP `opencodeFindFiles`
requests; the seq guard remains so any stale response is discarded.

**Typed `session.error` names.** The `session.error` handler switches on
`err.name` to prepend a context-appropriate prefix before the raw message:
`ProviderAuthError` → "Auth error: …", `ContextOverflowError` → "Context
full — try /compact: …", `MessageOutputLengthError` → "Response truncated
(hit output limit)", `StructuredOutputError`, `ApiError`. Add new branches
when opencode introduces new error class names; unknown names fall through
to the raw message.

**Live tool output (bash tailing) — the messageID + debounce-starvation
trap.** A running tool streams its stdout into `state.metadata.output` (NOT
`state.output`, which only exists at `completed`); `resolveToolOutput`
(`chatUtils.ts`) prefers `state.output` and falls back to the live
`metadata.output` so `BashBody` tails a long command's latest lines. opencode
emits a `message.part.updated` for the tool part every ~20-40ms as output
grows (verified live against `/events`). Two bugs conspired to make this show
nothing until the turn ended ("bash · running" with an empty body, then the
whole output dumped at once on completion):

- **messageID is at a DIFFERENT path per event type.** On
  `message.part.updated` the id lives at `properties.part.messageID`; the
  top-level `properties.messageID` is UNDEFINED (it's only set on
  `message.updated`). The handler read only `props.messageID`, so
  `message.part.updated` resolved to `""` and `spliceMessage("")` fell through
  to a FULL `scheduleRefetch()` instead of the targeted per-message splice.
  Fix: resolve `props.messageID ?? props.part.messageID ?? props.info.id`
  (`useSseBus.ts`).
- **The refetch debounce was starved.** Both `scheduleRefetch` and the
  per-message `spliceMessage` are 300ms-debounced with a timer that RESETS on
  every call. Because tool updates arrive every ~30ms — far faster than
  300ms — the timer never fired until the stream paused (turn idle). Fix: a
  per-message **max-wait guard** (`SPLICE_MAX_WAIT_MS = 250` in
  `useTranscriptState.ts`) — if a message's splice has been pending longer
  than the cap, the in-flight timer is allowed to fire instead of being reset,
  so live output updates at a steady ~4Hz cap. `spliceTimers` +
  `spliceFirstScheduledAt` are cleared on session change so a late timer can't
  write a stale message into the new session.

The renderer's render path (`resolveToolOutput` → `BashBody` →
`ConnectorOutput` pin-to-bottom, memoized on the `part` reference) was already
correct; the bug was purely event-routing + debounce, not rendering. The full
pipeline (opencode → manta-server `/events` → RPC `opencode:message`) delivers
`metadata.output` intact both mid-run and at completion — verified by
streaming the box's opencode `/event` and manta-server `/events` during a slow
`for i…; do echo; sleep 1; done`.

**Per-project SSE scope** — every session-mutating POST
(`prompt_async`, `command`, `fork`, `compact`) carries
`?directory=<session.directory>` so opencode runs tools inside the project
worktree. opencode's `/event` stream is ALSO scoped by `?directory=`: events
from a scoped POST land only on the matching scoped subscription, NOT on
the global stream. The event bus therefore opens **one `/event` stream per
directory** in addition to the global stream.

**Location (HTTP-only):** this machinery now lives entirely in manta-server —
`src/server/opencode.mjs` (`subscribeEvents`, `sessionDirectoryCache`,
`rememberSessionDirectory`) + `src/server/index.mjs` (the bus that spawns
per-directory streams and republishes on `/events`). References below to
`src/main/{index,opencode}.ts` are the deleted desktop-main equivalents, kept
only to explain the shared contract and the historical "identical bug in both
transports"; the surviving copy is the `src/server/*.mjs` one.

- `sessionDirectoryCache` (`src/server/opencode.mjs`) maps `sessionId →
  directory`; populated by `createSession`, `forkSession`, and `listSessions`
  (via a side-effect loop), and lazy-filled by `GET /session/{id}` on miss.
- `onSessionDirectoryAdded` lets the bus auto-spawn a stream whenever a new
  directory shows up in the cache.
- On startup the bus opens the global stream, replays
  `knownSessionDirectories()`, and calls `opencodeListSessions(config)` to
  prime the cache from server-side sessions (recovers from restarts).
- **GOTCHA — every cache write MUST go through `rememberSessionDirectory`,
  never a bare `sessionDirectoryCache.set`.** Only `rememberSessionDirectory`
  fires the `onSessionDirectoryAdded` listeners; a bare `.set` populates the
  map but the bus never learns to open the scoped stream. This was the exact
  "SSE broken in *existing* sessions, fine in new ones" bug:
  `getSessionDirectoryQuery`'s lazy-fetch branch used a bare `.set`, so an
  existing/restored session resolved on its first prompt never opened its
  scoped stream and every response event vanished. Fixed in BOTH transports
  (`src/main/opencode.ts` + `src/server/opencode.mjs` had the identical
  bug). Regression test: `sendPrompt lazy-fetch notifies directory
  listeners …` in `src/server/opencode.test.mjs` (red/green verified).
- **Readiness gate (desktop)** — even with the listener firing, the scoped
  stream opens asynchronously while the prompt POST is already in flight.
  `setDirectoryReadyGate` (registered by the bus in `src/main/index.ts`) lets
  `getSessionDirectoryQuery` await the scoped subscription being live before
  the scoped POST goes out. Bounded at 5s — a wedged server degrades to
  "send anyway", never freezes the prompt. Readiness re-arms on stream
  disconnect so reconnect-window prompts wait for the new subscription.
- **Success-path instrumentation** — the bus logs `[opencode-bus] stream
  CONNECTED dir=…`, the open-stream set, and a sampled per-dir event trace
  (event#0, then every 50th) to the dev log. The earlier `debug(...)` commits
  only logged the main-process cwd path, not SSE success — "nothing prints"
  was undiagnosable. Keep this; it's how you tell "events flowing for a dir"
  from "silent" (the bug signature).

Symptom you'll see if this breaks again: user message shows optimistically,
assistant turn stays blank forever, no JS errors. The transcript
(`GET .../message`) shows the response was generated and persisted — it
just never streams to the renderer because the matching scoped stream
isn't open. Verify with
`curl -sN 'http://127.0.0.1:4096/event?directory=<cwd>'` while a prompt is
in flight: you should see `message.part.delta` frames.

The mobile server (`src/server/opencode.mjs`) mirrors this with its own
`sessionDirectoryCache` and `subscribeEvents()` that opens global + one
scoped stream per known directory. Both code paths share the same contract;
when changing one, change the other.
- Sessions persist FileParts forever. A bad-mime FilePart (e.g. `application/json`)
  in history causes every subsequent Anthropic call to fail. Fix:
  `DELETE /session/{sid}/message/{mid}/part/{pid}` on each offender.
- `/api/model` leaks `apiKey` — never forward it. Use `/provider` instead
  (already done in `opencode.ts`).
- The `/question` endpoint returns 404 on older opencode servers (pre-v2). The
  fetch in ChatPanel is wrapped in `.catch(() => {})` — non-fatal.
- `opencodeVcsBranch` returns `null` for non-git cwds, detached HEAD,
  empty cwd, or transport failure. The renderer renders nothing for `null`
  (the `⎇ <branch>` indicator is gated on truthy branch). Don't treat
  `null` as an error.
- `vcs.branch.updated` events carry no `sessionID` — they pass the
  per-session filter by accident. Acceptable: there's only one branch per
  cwd, but be aware if you ever scope event handling more strictly.

## Subagent rendering (read-only, Phase 1)

When the parent agent invokes the `task` tool, opencode spawns a CHILD
session and runs the subagent inside it. The child's events flow on the
**same scoped `/event?directory=` stream** as the parent (child inherits
parent cwd), but with the child's `sessionID` — so the early sessionID
filter in `onOpencodeEvent` would drop them. Phase 1 renders the subagent
inline (collapsed by default, expand for full child transcript) without
spawning a tmux window for it. Phase 2 ("Open as session") is the open
work bullet at the bottom — promotes the child into its own chat-mode
window.

**Wire shape — verified live + against OpenAPI** (`/doc` endpoint, opencode
v2):

```js
// Parent's task tool part:
{ type: "tool", tool: "task", callID: "toolu_…", state: {
    status: "pending" | "running" | "completed" | "error",
    title: "Find skill loading code",        // opencode-generated
    input: { description, prompt, subagent_type },
    output: "I now have…",                    // present when completed
    metadata: {
      parentSessionId: "ses_parent",          // ourselves
      sessionId:       "ses_child",           // ← child id, present from
                                              //   first metadata write
      model: { providerID, modelID },
      truncated: false,
    },
    time: { start, end },                     // end set on completion
} }
```

**Child id discovery — two converging sources:**
1. `collectChildSessionIds(messages)` walks the transcript for
   `state.metadata.sessionId` on every task part. Used to seed the
   `childSessionIds` allowlist on initial fetch AND every refetch.
2. `session.created` events whose `properties.info.parentID === sessionId`
   add the new child id to the allowlist (covers the brief window before
   the parent's task part is stamped). **GOTCHA — registration MUST run
   BEFORE the per-session filter**, otherwise the filter drops the event
   whose payload would register the child:
   `EventSessionCreated.properties.sessionID` per opencode's OpenAPI is the
   NEW child's id, which is not in the allowlist yet (this event is what
   would add it). The pure `registerChildSessionFromCreated(ev, sessionId,
   childIds)` helper handles registration and is called before
   `shouldDropEventForSessionFilter(...)` in `onOpencodeEvent`. The
   regression is locked in by `shouldDropEventForSessionFilter REGRESSION:
   session.created for a new child …` in `chatUtils.test.ts`.

**The sessionID filter** (`shouldDropEventForSessionFilter` in
`chatUtils.ts`, called from `onOpencodeEvent`) is 3-state, not 2-state:
- `evSessionID === sessionId` → main session event, normal handling.
- `evSessionID ∈ childSessionIds` → CHILD event, routed to the subagent
  branch (re-fetches the child's transcript when its card is expanded;
  updates `liveChildStatus` on `session.idle` / `session.status`; triggers
  a parent refetch so the task part's `state.status` flips).
- otherwise → dropped (unless it's a self-filtering lifecycle event:
  `question.*` / `permission.*`).

**State pattern matches the "live-event preferred" rule** from the rest of
ChatPanel:
- `childSessionIds: Ref<Set<string>>` — allowlist consulted by the SSE
  handler; a ref so the closure reads current value without resubscribing.
- `childMessages: Map<childId, OpencodeMessage[]>` — lazily fetched on
  first expand; refetched (300ms debounce) on subsequent SSE traffic
  while expanded; ALSO refetched on re-expand when the child is still
  running (the cached snapshot would otherwise be stale until the next
  live event hits the now-expanded card).
- `liveChildStatus: Map<childId, "running"|"idle">` — overrides the
  parent's stale `state.status` snapshot for the header badge.
- `expandedTasks: Set<childId>` + `expandedTasksRef` mirror — the SSE
  handler gates per-child refetches on whether the card is expanded
  (closed cards don't burn fetch traffic).

**TaskContext** (provided by ChatPanel around the scroll container) is
how `TaskBody` reads this state without breaking the existing
MessageRow/AssistantPart/ToolCall/ToolBody memo chain. **Don't pass the
context value as a prop** — `taskContextValue` is memoized for keystroke
stability; provider value identity is what matters.

**Sidebar `·N` indicator for chat-mode subagents** flows through a new
`setChatSubagents(sessionId, count)` store action (mirrors
`setChatRunning` / `setChatAttention`). ChatPanel pushes
`countRunningSubagents(messages, liveChildStatus)` via a 1-effect
derivation. The store no-ops when the count is unchanged (perf:
ChatPanel re-derives on every message update, which is many per second
during streaming). The TUI poller's regex can't see chat-mode panes
(holder pane runs `sleep infinity`), so this is the **sole** update
path for the chat-window `·N` count.

**Helpers** (all pure + tested in `chatUtils.ts`):
- `extractSubagentInfo(part)` — returns `SubagentInfo | null`. Null when
  not a task part OR when `state.metadata.sessionId` isn't stamped yet
  (the pre-stamp window). Brittle on the wire format — if a test on this
  fails, opencode changed the task tool's metadata shape.
- `collectChildSessionIds(messages)` — for seeding the allowlist.
- `countRunningSubagents(messages, liveStatus)` — for the sidebar count.
  Live `idle` overrides transcript `running` (covers the stale-snapshot
  case); live `running` overrides transcript `completed` (covers the
  refetch-race case); missing live falls back to transcript.
- `summarizeChildSession(childMessages)` — `{toolCount, lastToolName,
  tokens}` for the collapsed header.

**What is NOT handled in Phase 1:**
- Nested subagents (sub-subagents) render recursively today because
  `TaskBody` re-enters the same `ToolBody` switch, but the second-level
  collapsed header is visually identical to the first — could become
  confusing on deep trees. No depth limit imposed.
- Permission/question requests originating in a child session are NOT
  surfaced in the parent's `PermissionCard` / `QuestionCard`. They reach
  the renderer (we no longer drop them via the filter), but the existing
  cards key on the parent's sessionId. Future: tag with "from subagent: X".
- "Open as session" — see the open-work bullet at the bottom.

## Voice / speech-to-text (Groq)

Push-to-talk mic button in the chat input. Hold = record, release = send to
transcription; tap toggles recording on/off. The transcript is inserted at
the caret as plain dictation. **There is no command/classifier mode.** The
former rules-first classifier, its Groq LLM fallback, `VoiceAction`
dispatch, and the `manta-voice-app-action` `CustomEvent` were removed from
the codebase — `src/shared/voiceClassifier.mjs` and the `voiceCommandModel`
setting no longer exist. Do not reintroduce them.

**Audio pipeline (identical on both transports):**
1. `useVoiceRecorder` (`src/renderer/voice.ts`) drives a `MediaRecorder`
   over `getUserMedia({audio:true})`. Mime selection prefers
   `audio/webm;codecs=opus` (Chromium), falls back to `audio/mp4` (iOS
   WKWebView — the only thing Apple ships).
2. On release, `window.api.voiceTranscribe({buffer, mime})` ships the
   `ArrayBuffer` to main/server. The mobile HTTP shim base64-encodes the
   buffer because the RPC body is JSON; `rpc.mjs` decodes back to a
   `Buffer`.
3. `src/shared/groq.mjs` (a transcription-only client — it exports exactly
   `filenameFor` and `transcribeAudio`, no chat/completions call) POSTs
   multipart to `https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/audio/transcriptions`
   with the configured key + model (default `whisper-large-v3-turbo`).

The Groq API key stays on main/server — the renderer only ever sends audio
bytes and receives the transcript back.

**Settings:** `groqApiKey` (gates the mic button — empty = hidden) and
`voiceTranscriptionModel`. Both live in AppConfig and the store; UI in
`Settings.tsx` and `MobileSettings.tsx`. Stored plaintext, same as other
MantaUI credentials.

**Mobile permissions:** `RECORD_AUDIO` + `MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS` in
`mobile/android/.../AndroidManifest.xml`; `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription`
in `mobile/ios/.../Info.plist`. Without these the first
`getUserMedia({audio:true})` call insta-rejects with `NotAllowedError`
before the OS prompt fires.

**Pure helpers (tested):** recording + timing in `src/renderer/voice.ts`
(tested by `src/renderer/voice.test.ts`): `VoicePhase`, `VoiceArtifact`,
`elapsedReset/Current/Pause/Resume`, `nearLimitAt`, `isTooShort`,
`pickRecorderMime`, `useVoiceRecorder`. (`fuzzyMatchModel` lives in
`src/shared/modelGuide.mjs`, used by app control — it is not part of the
recorder and is not exported from `voice.ts`.)

**Locked decisions (recorder):**
- **`MediaRecorder.start(250)` timeslice** — without it, iOS WKWebView
  17.x sometimes delivers the final `dataavailable` AFTER `onstop`,
  leaving an empty chunks array. 250ms forces periodic emission. The
  chunks just concatenate in the Blob constructor.
- **Cancel checked AFTER `getUserMedia` resolves** — a fast press
  release (cancel before mic permission resolves) used to leave the
  recorder running until the 60s `maxDurationMs` cap. We check
  `cancelledRef.current` between the await and the recorder
  construction; if true, tear the stream tracks down and bail.
- **Phase guard uses a ref, not state** — `phaseRef.current` is
  updated synchronously by `setPhaseSync` so two `pointerdown` events
  inside the same React commit can't both pass the re-entrancy guard.
- Batch transcription (no streaming) — Groq's HTTP API has no native
  streaming STT endpoint and short clips return in ~200-500ms. Don't
  reintroduce a chunked-streaming spike; it under-delivered vs the
  added complexity in spike testing.

## On-call CTO voice call (OpenAI Realtime)

The OpenAI key lives in Settings → On-call CTO (`openaiApiKey`), stored in the
box's config and never sent to the renderer. Narration uses the Groq key while
the Realtime model authenticates with the OpenAI key — two deliberately separate
credentials, each used where it belongs.

## File upload paths (chat-mode)

Three upload paths all land in `~/.manta-uploads/<session>/<ts>/` on the remote:

1. **Drag-drop** — `image/*`, PDF, audio, video → FilePart chip.
   Everything else → `@<abs-path>` text appended to textarea.
2. **Paste** (`⌘V` in chat input) — intercepts `image/*` clipboard items,
    calls `uploadBuffer` IPC (bytes → Mac tmpfile → HTTP `POST /api/upload`).
    Same chip as drag-drop.
3. **Screenshot detector** — two parallel paths in `main/index.ts`:
   - *Clipboard poller* (500ms): fingerprints clipboard via `availableFormats()`
     + image size. Fires on `⌘⇧Control+3/4`. Pushes `screenshotDetected` IPC.
   - *Desktop watcher* (`fs.watch ~/Desktop`): matches
     `Screenshot YYYY-MM-DD at HH.MM.SS.png`. Fires on `⌘⇧3/4`. 300ms settle
     delay before pushing.
   ChatPanel shows a toast: "Screenshot in clipboard" / "Screenshot: <name>"
   with "Add to chat" (uploads + chip) and "×" dismiss.
   **Do NOT add `document.hidden` check** — MantaUI loses focus during the screenshot
   gesture so the event would always be dropped.

`uploadBuffer` (`src/renderer/api/httpApi.ts`): POSTs the `ArrayBuffer` bytes
straight to manta-server `POST /api/upload?session=<name>` with the Bearer token;
the server writes `~/.manta-uploads/<session>/<batch>/<filename>` and returns the
absolute remote path. (Historical: the deleted desktop-SSH `pty.ts` version
staged a Mac tmpfile + scp + remote `mv`; HTTP-only sends bytes directly.)

## Subagent management — auto-register + activation toggle (BET-123)

Settings → AI tab → `SubagentsCard` (mounts after `ProvidersCard`; **desktop
only**, same as BET-121 — not in `MobileSettings.tsx`). opencode's `task` tool
has no `model` argument; the only way to run a subagent on a chosen model is a
NAMED agent in `opencode.jsonc`'s `agent` key, dispatched via
`task(subagent_type: "<name>")`. opencode re-scans `agent` **only at
startup**, so a config write does nothing until opencode restarts (see the
restart button below).

**Maximally permissive, not opt-in.** Every model in
`window.api.opencodeModels()` gets an `agent` block automatically; the user
DEACTIVATES the ones they don't want, rather than hand-picking which to add.
One row per model, sourced from the model list — NOT from the configured
agent blocks — so a not-yet-registered model still shows up.

- **Naming**: `deriveSubagentName(providerID, modelID, taken)` in
  `src/shared/subagentSync.mjs` (pure, tested). Prefers the `modelGuide.mjs`
  catalog family key (`haiku`, `sonnet`, `gpt-4o`, ...) via the exported
  `familyKey()`; falls back to a slugified modelID, then providerID, then
  `"model"`. Collisions get a numeric suffix (`-2`, `-3`, ...), case-
  insensitive against the taken set.
- **Deactivation = the agent block is ABSENT from opencode.jsonc**, not a
  flag inside it (an `agent` block can't safely carry arbitrary MantaUI metadata
  without risking opencode rejecting unknown keys). The set of deactivated
  models is MantaUI-side state: `AppConfig.deactivatedSubagents: string[]`
  (`"providerID/modelID"` strings), persisted through the EXISTING
  `configGet`/`configUpdate` channels — no dedicated IPC channel was added
  for this; it's exactly a plain config field, same as `skillRegistryUrls`.
  NOT in `sharedConfig.mjs`'s `SHARED_CONFIG_KEYS` (device-local for now,
  matching that module's device-local-by-default stance for anything not
  explicitly listed there).
- **Reconciliation**: `reconcileSubagents({models, existingAgents,
  deactivated})` in `src/shared/subagentSync.mjs` (pure, tested) diffs the
  model list against the configured blocks + the deactivated set →
  `{upsert, remove}`. A model already registered is left untouched (preserves
  a user-renamed name/description); a block whose `model` doesn't match any
  known model is NEVER touched (a user's hand-made agent survives). The I/O
  wrapper `syncSubagents({models, deactivated})` in `src/server/providers.mjs`
  reads `opencode.jsonc`, reconciles, and applies via the EXISTING
  `setSubagents` writer (the two config writers: upserts through
  `PATCH /global/config`, deletions through `removeConfigKeys` + mandatory
  opencode restart, see the AppConfig section above). A deactivated model's
  block is removed from opencode.jsonc by that deletion path — the remove is
  no longer a no-op. No-op diffs skip
  the write
  entirely, so it's safe to call on every card open AND every activation
  toggle (`opencode:sync-subagents` RPC channel — mirrors `get`/`set-subagents`
  1:1). Idempotent: running it twice against its own output is a no-op.
- **Restart**: `opencode:restart` (`src/server/opencodeAdmin.mjs`,
  `restartOpencode()`) was a no-op stub through BET-121; now runs
  `systemctl --user restart opencode-serve` via `execFile` with a fixed argv
  array (never a shell string — no injection surface, and none is possible
  since the function takes no external input). This is opencode's OWN systemd
  service, **separate from manta-server** — restarting it does not restart
  manta-server, but it DOES drop every in-flight opencode turn across every
  chat-mode window. The card's restart button is gated behind an explicit
  confirm ("STOPS all running opencode sessions...") — restart is never
  triggered automatically as a side effect of a subagent edit.
  **Pre-existing callers**: `ProvidersCard.tsx` / `ProvidersStep.tsx` already
  called `window.api.opencodeRestart()` after adding a provider (so `/provider`
  re-auths) — that call was always a no-op before this ticket; it is now a
  REAL restart with the same drop-all-sessions side effect. That's intentional
  (the provider flow was designed around a working restart from the start),
  not new scope creep — but be aware if you're debugging "why did opencode
  restart" reports.
- Desktop reaches all of this the same way as every other opencode/data
  channel post-pairing: `window.api` is swapped to `httpApi` in `main.tsx`
  (`/rpc` to manta-server), so there is no separate Electron `ipcMain.handle`
  wiring for subagent channels — the `preload/index.ts` methods exist only as
  the `Api` type source + a residual pre-HTTP-mode implementation.
- Context-size badge (`Nk`) is `formatModelContextSize()` in `chatUtils.ts`
  (tested) — the single source for the `Math.round(context/1000)k`
  expression; `ModelPicker.tsx` and `SubagentsCard.tsx` both import it rather
  than re-deriving.
- Tests: `src/shared/subagentSync.test.ts` (naming + reconcile, 18),
  `src/server/providers.test.mjs` `syncSubagents` describe block (7),
  `src/server/opencodeAdmin.test.mjs` (restart, 3), `formatModelContextSize`
   in `chatUtils.test.ts` (2). All pure/injected-I/O — no real opencode.jsonc
   or systemctl call in the suite.

## iOS crash reporting — Firebase Crashlytics (replaced PLCrashReporter)

Crash capture for the native app (`mobile/native`) is **Firebase Crashlytics**.
It replaced PLCrashReporter on 2026-08-13. Do not run both.

- **Why not both.** Both install Mach exception handlers and compete for the
  same task-level exception port. They chain unreliably and the loser silently
  drops the crash — you get a crash reporter that is quiet exactly when it
  matters. Firebase's own docs warn against a second reporter. If you want the
  old box-upload behaviour back, REMOVE Crashlytics first.
- **What was deleted**: `mobile/native/MantaUI/CrashReports.swift` (PLCrashReporter
  capture + `uploadPending` → `POST /api/upload` into `~/.manta-uploads/crash/`)
  and the `CrashReporter` SPM package. There is no longer a crash path to the
  box; reports go to the Firebase console and are readable by an agent through
  the Firebase MCP server's `crashlytics_*` tools.
- **Wiring is one call**: `FirebaseApp.configure()` in `MantaUIApp.init()`.
  Crashlytics installs its handlers as a side effect — there is no "start"
  call, and no upload call anywhere. A crash is written on-device in the dying
  process and sent by the SDK on the **next launch**.
- **Three project.yml settings are load-bearing, and each fails silently-ish:**
  - `OTHER_LDFLAGS: -ObjC` — without it the linker strips Firebase's Obj-C
    categories and you get a runtime selector-not-found crash, not a link error.
  - `DEBUG_INFORMATION_FORMAT: dwarf-with-dsym` on **base**, not just Release.
    Xcode's Debug default is plain `dwarf`, which produces NO dSYM — and the
    `ios-mantaui` plugin installs a **Debug** build, so the default would mean
    every crash off the phone came back as raw addresses.
  - The `Crashlytics dSYM upload` entry must stay in **`postBuildScripts`** so
    it is the LAST build phase; Crashlytics cannot process dSYMs otherwise. Its
    `inputFiles` list is not decoration — with User Script Sandboxing on, Xcode
    only lets the script read files declared there.
- **The phase calls `upload-symbols` DIRECTLY, not Firebase's documented
  `Crashlytics/run` wrapper. Do not "fix" it back.** `run` was used first and
  silently uploaded NOTHING: the phase executed, the build was green, and the
  console still said "2 unprocessed crashes — upload 1 dSYM file", with no
  upload line anywhere in a 7,441-line build log. `run` backgrounds its work, so
  a failure inside it neither prints nor fails the build. The same
  `upload-symbols` call run by hand against the same dSYM submitted both UUIDs
  instantly. Observable beats documented.
- **The two-UUID trap (`ENABLE_DEBUG_DYLIB`).** Xcode 16+ sets it YES for
  Debug, splitting the binary: real code goes to `<name>.debug.dylib`, the main
  executable becomes a stub, and the dSYM carries TWO arm64 slices with
  different UUIDs. A crash references the **debug.dylib's** UUID, so uploading
  only the `${PRODUCT_NAME}` slice leaves every Debug crash unsymbolicated —
  which is exactly the state this shipped in first. Passing the whole `.dSYM`
  BUNDLE makes `upload-symbols` walk both slices. Release is not split and
  yields one slice, so one command covers both and there is no per-config
  branch. **This never affected the Codemagic TestFlight path** (it archives
  Release); it only ever broke local Debug device installs.
- **On-demand upload**: the `ios-crashlytics-dsym` plugin (`action: upload`)
  uploads the last device build's dSYM from the Mac and prints the submitted
  UUIDs. Use it when a crash arrives unsymbolicated rather than rebuilding.
  Note its `action: diagnose` prints `ENABLE_DEBUG_DYLIB` /
  `ENABLE_USER_SCRIPT_SANDBOXING` / the SPM checkout contents — the three
  things that determine whether the in-build phase can work at all.

### Reading crashes from an agent session (Firebase MCP)

Crashes are no longer uploaded to the box, so `~/.manta-uploads/crash/` is
dead. Read them through the **`firebase` MCP server**, wired into the dev box's
`~/.config/opencode/opencode.jsonc` and scoped `--only crashlytics` (8 tools
instead of 25 — the rest are Firestore/Auth/deploy and cost context on every
request).

**Constants you need — none are discoverable from the tools:**

| | |
|---|---|
| `appId` (**required on every call**) | `1:789525210372:ios:423827eb6f93a9c8b45c51` |
| Firebase project | `manta-76416` (number `789525210372`) |
| Bundle id | `com.antoinedc.mantaui` |

Typical loop: `crashlytics_get_report` (`topIssues`) to find what is breaking →
`crashlytics_get_issue` for one issue → `crashlytics_batch_get_events` with the
issue's `sampleEvent` for the **symbolicated stack**, device, OS, memory, and
`customKeys.crash_info_entry_0` (which carries the literal Swift fatal-error
string with `file:line`). `crashlytics_update_issue` closes an issue.

Four traps, each of which looks like "the data is missing":

- **`topIssues` only returns OPEN issues.** A closed one comes back as "This
  report response contains no results" — indistinguishable from a broken query.
  `crashlytics_get_issue` returns it by id regardless of state. Check `state:`
  before concluding anything is wrong. This wasted real time on 2026-08-13.
- **Unprocessed crashes are invisible.** Until a matching dSYM is uploaded,
  Crashlytics holds events and returns nothing through the API — the console
  says "N unprocessed crashes, upload 1 dSYM file" but the API just looks
  empty. If the API is empty and the console shows that banner, the problem is
  symbols, not the query. Fix with the `ios-crashlytics-dsym` plugin.
- **Processing is not instant.** Expect minutes between a dSYM upload and the
  crash becoming queryable.
- **Debug-build frames are attributed to `MantaUI.debug.dylib`**, not
  `MantaUI` — that is the `ENABLE_DEBUG_DYLIB` split described above, not a
  mis-symbolication.

Auth is a read-scoped service-account key at
`~/.config/gcloud/manta/manta-76416-sa.json` (0600). Never print it, and never
copy it into `/tmp` (swept hourly). It requires the **Firebase Crashlytics API**
to be enabled on the project — it is, since 2026-08-13; a `SERVICE_DISABLED`
403 means someone turned it off.
- **`GoogleService-Info.plist` is committed on purpose** and is excluded from
  the `MantaUI` directory source entry, then re-added with an explicit
  `buildPhase: resources`. It must land in Copy Bundle Resources or
  `FirebaseApp.configure()` finds no options and traps at launch. It is
  committed because the `ios-mantaui` build clone is force-reset to origin and
  `git clean`s `mobile/native` — an untracked file would be wiped. The `AIza…`
  key in it is a client identifier, not a secret (extractable from any IPA;
  access is bounded by Firebase Security Rules / App Check).
- **Bundle id must match the Firebase app exactly.** The first plist issued for
  this was registered to `com.antoinedc.manta` while the app is
  `com.antoinedc.mantaui`; that mismatch fails at configure time. Firebase app
  id `1:789525210372:ios:423827eb6f93a9c8b45c51`, project `manta-76416`.
- **Analytics is deliberately NOT linked.** It is optional for Crashlytics and
  buys breadcrumb logs, at the cost of an analytics surface this app has no
  other use for (`IS_ANALYTICS_ENABLED` is false in the plist). Add it as a
  decision, not by reflex.
- **Verifying it**: there is no test-crash button in the app — a `#if DEBUG`
  one existed only to prove the integration (commit `ed8a682`) and was removed
  once it had (`SettingsScreen.crashTestFooter`; restore from git if needed).
  To re-verify, add a `fatalError(...)` behind a temporary control, or crash the
  app any other way. Two rules make or break the test: the report uploads on the
  **NEXT launch**, not the crashing one, and **only with the Xcode debugger
  detached** — the debugger intercepts the signal and Crashlytics never sees it.
  The plugin's `devicectl process launch` is detached, so a plugin install + tap
  + reopen is a valid test. Proven end-to-end 2026-08-13: the crash symbolicated
  to `SettingsScreen.swift:346` with the frame attributed to
  `MantaUI.debug.dylib` — which is itself the evidence for the split-binary note
  above.

## iOS release / TestFlight (Codemagic — the WORKING mechanism)

The iOS app (the Capacitor wrapper in `mobile/ios/`) ships to TestFlight via
**Codemagic CI**, configured by **`codemagic.yaml`** at the repo root. This
section is the hard-won record of what works and — just as important — the dead
ends, so nobody re-walks them.

**TL;DR of the pipeline:** push a git tag `ios-v*` → Codemagic clones the repo,
builds the web bundle, syncs Capacitor, pods, **creates its own distribution
cert + App Store profile via the App Store Connect API key**, archives the
`App` scheme, and uploads to TestFlight. No Mac in the loop. The box can drive
the whole thing (trigger + monitor) over the Codemagic + ASC REST APIs.

### Why Codemagic, NOT Xcode Cloud (do not retry Xcode Cloud)

Xcode Cloud was tried first and **abandoned after 10 failed build runs**. It
built + signed the archive fine every time but could **NEVER authenticate to
App Store Connect to UPLOAD** the binary. The build log (fetched from the
`app-store-export-archive-logs` in Xcode Cloud's LOG_BUNDLE artifact) always
ended with:

```
App Store Connect request for store configuration failed for account
Session Proxy Provider … Unable to authenticate with App Store Connect
(…DVTServicesSessionProviderCredentialITunesAuthenticationContextError Code=1)
```

This is a **known Xcode Cloud auth-session bug**. It survived: accepting the
Program License Agreement, registering a device UDID, creating a
distribution cert + profile by hand, re-saving the workflow, AND
disconnecting/reconnecting the GitHub source. The `action_required` /
"Preparing build for App Store Connect failed" status and the ITMS-90035
emails were all downstream of this one auth failure (the ITMS-90035 signature
errors specifically came from Xcode Cloud's throwaway **ad-hoc / development**
side-exports, which are red herrings — the app-store export signed correctly).
**Do not reintroduce an Xcode Cloud workflow.** The stale files it left
(`mobile/ios/App/App.xcodeproj/xcshareddata/xcschemes/App.xcscheme` and
`mobile/ios/App/ci_scripts/ci_post_clone.sh`) are harmless leftovers; the
shared scheme is still needed by Codemagic, the `ci_scripts/` post-clone is
Xcode-Cloud-only and unused by Codemagic (safe to delete).

### App Store Connect facts (constants used everywhere)

- **App name**: MantaUI. **ASC app Apple ID**: `6792363427`.
- **Bundle id**: `com.antoinedc.mantaui` (was `com.antoinedc.MantaUI` originally —
  renamed before anything shipped; the id is permanent post-release). Set in
  `capacitor.config.json` `appId`, the iOS `PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER` (both
  Debug+Release configs), and the Android `applicationId`/`namespace`/
  `MainActivity` package.
- **On-device display name**: MantaUI (`CFBundleDisplayName` in
  `mobile/ios/App/App/Info.plist` + `appName` in `capacitor.config.json`).
- **Xcode target/scheme**: `App` (Capacitor convention — internal only, NOT
  user-visible; do NOT rename it, that path throws "already taken by your team"
  and breaks the scheme/pods/ci_scripts wiring).
- **Team ID (seedId)**: `FSQ3HS4Z24`.

### Signing — the crux, and every trap in order

iOS code signing was THE blocker (every archive failure traced to it). The
final working model, in `codemagic.yaml`'s "Set up code signing" step:

1. `keychain initialize`
2. **Generate an RSA private key ON the build machine**
   (`ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -m PEM -f /tmp/dist_key -q -N ""`).
3. **Create a distribution cert FROM that key** via the ASC API key
   (`app-store-connect certificates create --type IOS_DISTRIBUTION
   --certificate-key=@file:/tmp/dist_key --save`), falling back to
   `certificates list … --save` if a cert already exists (max 2 distribution
   certs/account).
4. `app-store-connect fetch-signing-files "$BUNDLE_ID" --platform IOS
   --type IOS_APP_STORE --certificate-key=@file:/tmp/dist_key --create` —
   creates the App Store provisioning profile and assembles a usable p12.
5. `keychain add-certificates`
6. `xcode-project use-profiles --export-options-plist
   "$CM_BUILD_DIR/export_options.plist"` — writes the profile specifier into
   the Xcode project AND the export-options plist consumed by `build-ipa`.

**THE ROOT-CAUSE LESSON — private-key custody.** A distribution certificate is
only usable by whoever holds its **private key**. Every early failure
("`Cannot save Signing Certificates without certificate private key`" →
`use-profiles` finds `Provisioning Profiles: []` → xcodebuild `error: "App"
requires a provisioning profile`) came from a cert whose private key was NOT on
the Codemagic build machine. A cert created out-of-band (e.g. via the ASC API
from the box, with the key on the box) is **worthless to Codemagic**. The build
machine MUST generate the key and create the cert from it. This is step 2→3
above and is the single most important thing in this section.

**Dead ends that were tried and REMOVED (do not reintroduce):**
- A declarative `environment: ios_signing:` block → resolves signing at
  env-setup time (before scripts run) and fails "No matching profiles found"
  when the profile doesn't exist yet. Removed; the script step creates it.
- Hardcoding `PROVISIONING_PROFILE_SPECIFIER = "MantaUI App Store"` in the
  Xcode project → the profile Codemagic installs on the machine isn't named
  that, so xcodebuild errors "No profile … matching 'MantaUI App Store'".
  Let `use-profiles` set the specifier instead.
- `CODE_SIGN_STYLE = Automatic` in the project → conflicts with Codemagic's
  Manual signing. The project's target Release config is now
  `CODE_SIGN_STYLE = Manual` + `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM = FSQ3HS4Z24` +
  `CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY[sdk=iphoneos*] = "Apple Distribution"` (no hardcoded
  profile specifier — `use-profiles` fills it).
- `--export-options-plist /tmp/export_options.plist` → wrong path;
  `use-profiles` writes it to `$CM_BUILD_DIR/export_options.plist`. Both the
  `use-profiles` and `build-ipa` calls must use the SAME `$CM_BUILD_DIR` path.

### One-time human setup (already done, documented for re-setup)

In the Codemagic web UI (codemagic.io):
1. Connect the GitHub repo `antoinedc/MantaUI` as a Codemagic app.
2. Team → Integrations → Developer Portal → add an **App Store Connect API
   key** (Issuer ID + Key ID + the `.p8`). **GOTCHA: `codemagic.yaml` references
   the integration by NAME** (`integrations: app_store_connect: <name>`). The
   live integration is named **`APS Key`** — the YAML must match it exactly
   (spaces + case). If you rename it in the UI, update the YAML.

The ASC API key also lives in the MantaUI Secrets card (`ASC_API_KEY_P8`,
`ASC_KEY_ID`, `ASC_ISSUER_ID`, scope `project:manta`) so the box can drive the
ASC API directly. A `CODEMAGIC_API_KEY` secret (same scope) lets the box drive
Codemagic's API.

### Triggering a release (from the box, hands-off)

`codemagic.yaml`'s `triggering:` builds on git tag `ios-v*`. The box can:
- **Trigger by tag**: push `ios-v<version>` (the `ios-release-tag.yml` GitHub
  Actions workflow auto-creates `ios-v<MARKETING_VERSION>` on merge to main —
  reads `MARKETING_VERSION` from `project.pbxproj`; idempotent, only tags a new
  version; `workflow_dispatch` force-tags with a build suffix).
- **Trigger by Codemagic API** (what was used during bring-up — does NOT need a
  tag, good for iterating):
  ```
  CMK=$(secret_provide CODEMAGIC_API_KEY)         # path, use by reference
  curl -s -X POST -H "x-auth-token: $(cat $CMK)" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"appId":"6a5bfe08d7050a29d2f33802","workflowId":"ios-testflight","branch":"<branch>"}' \
    https://api.codemagic.io/builds
  ```
  Codemagic app id: `6a5bfe08d7050a29d2f33802`. Workflow id: `ios-testflight`.

### Monitoring a build (from the box — Codemagic API)

The GitHub commit-status the way Xcode Cloud reported does NOT exist for
Codemagic; use its REST API. `x-auth-token: <CODEMAGIC_API_KEY>` on every call.

- Status + steps: `GET https://api.codemagic.io/builds/<buildId>` →
  `build.status` (`queued|preparing|building|publishing|finished|failed`) and
  `build.buildActions[]` (each `{name,status}`).
- **Failure diagnosis — the step summary log is TRUNCATED.** For the real
  xcodebuild error, download the build's artifact bundle
  (`build.artefacts[0].url`, note British spelling `artefacts`), unzip, and
  grep `App.log` (the full xcodebuild log) for
  `error:|The following build commands failed|No profile|private key`. The
  per-step `logUrl` (under `buildActions[].subactions[].logUrl`) is HTML and
  only holds the wrapper summary — good for the "Set up code signing" step's
  `use-profiles` output ("`Provisioning Profiles: []`" is the empty-profile
  tell), but the archive error only lives in the artifact `App.log`.
- **Authoritative success signal**: the ASC API, NOT Codemagic's status. Query
  `GET https://api.appstoreconnect.apple.com/v1/builds?filter[app]=6792363427
  &sort=-uploadedDate` (ES256 JWT signed with the ASC `.p8`; the box has a
  working signer at `/tmp/opencode/asc.mjs` — reconstructs the PEM because the
  Secrets card flattens the `.p8` newlines into spaces). `processingState:
  VALID` on a build = it's really in App Store Connect. During bring-up every
  Xcode-Cloud "Build N" number was a REJECTED upload, never an accepted build —
  so "did it actually land?" must be checked against ASC, not the CI status.

### Distributing to testers (App Store Connect, human step)

Internal testing (fast, no review, ≤100 testers): ASC → MantaUI → TestFlight →
add testers under Users and Access + assign to the Internal group. External
testing (≤10,000, email or public link) requires a one-time Beta App Review of
the first build.

**Export compliance is answered in the binary and must stay that way.**
`ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption=false` is set in
`mobile/native/MantaUI/Info.plist` (the app speaks only standard HTTPS/TLS,
which is exempt). Without that key the failure is misleading in a specific way
that cost a debugging session on 2026-08-14: **every build script goes green,
the `.ipa` uploads AND finishes processing, and only the post-build "App Store
Connect distribution" task fails** with `422 The build is missing export
compliance` — so the Codemagic run reads `status: finished` and its
`buildActions` are all `success`. The failure lives ONLY in
`build.appStoreConnectTasks[].status`, which is the field to check when a build
looks green but nothing reaches testers. Answering the question by hand in the
ASC UI is not a substitute: the automated TestFlight submission runs seconds
after processing, long before a human sees it.

### Versioning

`MARKETING_VERSION` (CFBundleShortVersionString) lives in
`mobile/native/project.yml` (the xcodegen source of truth; the pbxproj is
derived from it). Bump it to ship a new TestFlight build; the auto-tag workflow
keys off it. `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` (build number) — Codemagic/ASC handle
uniqueness. First shipped version: `1.0.1`.

**The version line is CONTINUOUS across the Swift rewrite — do not reset it.**
The Capacitor app shipped up to `1.0.16`; the native rewrite started its own
`project.yml` at `0.1.0` and shipped `0.1.0`–`0.1.2`, which reads to a tester as
the app going BACKWARDS (TestFlight sorts them below every build they already
had, and the pre-release version list interleaves two unrelated trains). The
line was rejoined at **`1.0.17`** on 2026-08-14. Anything numbered `0.x` is
from that brief window — never bump into `0.x` again, and never "start fresh"
on a rewrite: the users' install history is the thing being versioned, not the
codebase's.

## Release & CD pipeline — TAG-DRIVEN, one manual step

**THE MODEL: agents merge to `main` → a human pushes ONE git tag → the matching
release fires automatically.** Pushing the tag is the ONLY manual step. Every
target verifies itself after deploying and fails RED if the result is stale /
down, so "merged but never deployed" (the bug that left BET-174's
`llms-install.md` 404 on prod for days) can't hide.

**CRITICAL DISTINCTION: "done" in Multica ≠ deployed.** `multica-close-on-merge.yml`
flips an issue to `done` the moment its PR merges to `main` — that says NOTHING
about whether it reached prod. Merging is necessary but NOT sufficient; the
deploy is the tag push. If someone reports "issue X is done but not live", the
fix is almost always "it was merged but no release tag was pushed" — check the
live URL / TestFlight against `main`, then push the right tag.

### The six release targets (each its own tag prefix)

| Tag prefix | Target | Runner | What fires | Config |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `ios-v*` | iOS app → TestFlight | Codemagic `mac_mini_m2` | build + sign + notarize `.ipa` → TestFlight | `codemagic.yaml` `ios-testflight` |
| `mac-v*` | macOS desktop → DMG | Codemagic `mac_mini_m2` | build + Developer ID sign → DMG → publish to `mantaui.com` | `codemagic.yaml` `mac-desktop` |
| `win-v*` | Windows desktop → NSIS installer on a **GitHub Release** (not mantaui.com) | GitHub-hosted (`windows-latest`) | build `.exe` + `latest.yml`, attach the `.exe` to a prerelease on the tag | `.github/workflows/windows-desktop-build.yml` |
| `web-v*` | marketing site + install assets | GitHub-hosted (`ubuntu-latest`) | scp `website/` + `install.sh` + `llms-install.md` → prod webroot (via `PROD_SSH_KEY` secret), verify | `.github/workflows/website-deploy.yml` |
| `server-v*` | Linux box server tarball(s) → `mantaui.com/releases` | GitHub-hosted (`ubuntu-latest` x64 + `ubuntu-24.04-arm` matrix + `ubuntu-latest` publish) | build x64 + arm64 tarballs natively, merge the two per-arch sidecars via `scripts/release/merge-manifest.mjs`, scp both tarballs + the combined manifest to prod (via `PROD_SSH_KEY` secret), verify both arches (200 + sha256 drift) | `.github/workflows/server-tarball-deploy.yml` |
| `relay-v*` | ~~relay service~~ (deprecated 2026-07; replaced by direct mode) | n/a | n/a | `.github/workflows/relay-deploy.yml` (deleted in BET-204) |
| `gateway-v*` | push gateway service (APNs + DNS automation) | GitHub-hosted (`ubuntu-latest`) | `git pull /opt/manta` + restart `manta-gateway` (via `PROD_SSH_KEY` secret), health-poll `/healthz` | `.github/workflows/gateway-deploy.yml` |

Tag-pattern filtering means only the matching workflow runs — an `ios-v*` tag
never triggers a mac/web/gateway deploy and vice-versa. All targets live in
the ONE monorepo; the tag prefix is what routes.

**How to cut a release (all targets):**
```
# iOS — bump MARKETING_VERSION in project.pbxproj first, merge, then:
git tag ios-v1.0.8 && git push origin ios-v1.0.8
# (the ios-release-tag.yml workflow also AUTO-tags ios-v<MARKETING_VERSION> on
#  merge to main, so iOS often needs no manual tag — just the version bump.)

# Desktop — bump package.json version if you want, then:
git tag mac-v0.0.2 && git push origin mac-v0.0.2

# Windows desktop — bump package.json version if you want, then tag. The tag
# publishes a PRERELEASE on GitHub with the .exe attached; nothing reaches
# mantaui.com. (workflow_dispatch also works, but produces only an artifact.)
git tag win-v0.0.13 && git push origin win-v0.0.13

# Website / install.sh / llms-install.md:
git tag web-v2 && git push origin web-v2

# Linux box server tarballs (x64 + arm64):
git tag server-v1 && git push origin server-v1

# Push gateway (only when the gateway service code changed — APNs, DNS, store):
git tag gateway-v2 && git push origin gateway-v2
```
`web-v1` / `relay-v1` are already used (bring-up tests for the now-deprecated
relay) — real releases bump the number. Codemagic builds can ALSO be triggered
by API without a tag (see the iOS section's "Triggering a release" for the
`curl` + `CODEMAGIC_API_KEY` recipe) — useful for re-running a build without a
version bump.

**PUSH RELEASE TAGS ONE AT A TIME — NEVER MORE THAN THREE IN ONE PUSH.**
GitHub silently drops the `push` event when a single push creates **more than
three tags**: the refs are created, `git push` prints `[new tag]` for each, and
**not one workflow runs**. Nothing anywhere reports an error — the only symptom
is that `gh run list --workflow <target>.yml` shows no run for the new tag. This
bit the 2026-07-28 release: `git push origin mac-v0.0.17 win-v0.0.15 server-v10
web-v16` created all four tags and triggered zero deploys (Codemagic's own tag
webhook was suppressed for the mac tag too, so it is not Actions-specific).

A re-push of an already-existing tag is a no-op and fires nothing, so recovery
is **delete the remote tag, then push it again alone**:

```
git push origin :refs/tags/<tag>   # delete remote
git push origin <tag>              # re-push alone → event fires
```

Push each release tag in its own `git push`, and confirm each one actually
started a run before pushing the next:
`gh run list --workflow <target>.yml --limit 1`.

### iOS (`ios-v*`) — Codemagic

Full detail in "## iOS release / TestFlight". Summary: build+sign+notarize on a
Codemagic M2 runner, upload to TestFlight via the ASC API key integration
(`APS Key`). Signing gotcha: the account caps at 2 distribution certs per type;
when maxed, the build's fresh-key `create` 409s and it can't find a usable cert
→ archive fails "requires a provisioning profile". Fix: revoke stale certs via
the ASC API (`/tmp/opencode/asc.mjs` on the box signs the JWT; a `DELETE
/v1/certificates/<id>` frees a slot).

Trigger chain: a version bump merged to `main` makes `ios-release-tag.yml`
create `ios-v<MARKETING_VERSION>` and then CALL `codemagic-ios-trigger.yml`
directly. The direct call is mandatory — GitHub creates no workflow run for a
ref pushed with `GITHUB_TOKEN`, so that workflow's own tag-push trigger only
ever covers a human `git push ios-v*`. Codemagic's own tag webhook is a third,
unreliable path (it caught 1.0.12/1.0.13 within ~90s but dropped 1.0.10
entirely) — treat it as a bonus, never the plan.

### Desktop (`mac-v*`) — Codemagic + self-hosted publish

`codemagic.yaml` `mac-desktop`. Runs `electron-vite build` → `electron-builder
--mac`. Key facts, each a hard-won fix (do not regress):

- **arm64 ONLY** (`electron-builder.yml` `mac.target.arch: [arm64]`) — halves
  build + (if on) notarization time. Re-add `x64` only if an Intel tester needs it.
- **BOTH a `dmg` AND a `zip` are built, and the ZIP is the one auto-update
  needs.** The DMG is the human download; electron-updater cannot install from
  it. Its macOS path hands the update to Squirrel.Mac, which only accepts a
  zipped `.app`: `MacUpdater` resolves the artifact with
  `findFile(files, "zip", ["pkg", "dmg"])` — **dmg is on the EXCLUDED list, not
  a fallback** — and throws `ERR_UPDATER_ZIP_FILE_NOT_FOUND` when the feed has
  none. `latest-mac.yml` shipped DMG-only from the start, so **every download
  attempt on every Mac threw instantly and desktop auto-update never worked at
  all**, from 0.0.x through 0.0.35. It was invisible because the message
  contains no `checksum`/`signature`/permission keyword, so
  `src/shared/updateError.mjs` classified it "transient" and swallowed it —
  the same silence as the 0.0.13/0.0.14 checksum bug, a different cause, and it
  hid *behind* that fix (a correct digest for an artifact the updater refuses to
  read still installs nothing). Consequences while it was broken: `update-
  downloaded` never fired, so the sidebar update dot and About's "Restart to
  update" strip were both unreachable on macOS. Three guards now exist —
  a `"feed"` class in the classifier (checked BEFORE integrity, because the real
  message embeds the file list JSON and therefore contains the substring
  `sha512`), a codemagic step that fails the build if the feed lists no `.zip`,
  and a warning in `publish.sh`. **Do not drop the `zip` target to save build
  time.** It is packed from the already-notarized `.app` and is not rewritten
  afterwards (unlike the DMG, which the staple step rewrites — hence
  `restamp-update-feed.mjs`), so its feed digest is correct as written and it
  needs no separate notarization pass. It is uploaded to the update feed dir
  only, never to `downloads/`.
- **node-gyp needs `distutils`** — the runner's Python 3.12 removed it from
  stdlib; the "Provide distutils" step `pip install "setuptools<81"` before
  `npm ci` (electron-builder rebuilds native `node-pty`, which the DESKTOP app
  doesn't even use — it's a `src/server/` dep — but the rebuild still runs).
- **Signing via Codemagic `keychain` CLI, NOT electron-builder's own import.**
  The "Import Developer ID cert into a Codemagic keychain" step does `keychain
  initialize` + `keychain add-certificates`. Letting electron-builder import the
  `.p12` into its own temp keychain made `codesign` HANG forever waiting on a
  GUI unlock that never comes on CI (build stalled right after "signing …
  Manta UI.app"). After the keychain step, CSC_LINK/CSC_KEY_PASSWORD are
  UNSET so electron-builder auto-discovers the "Developer ID Application"
  identity (`mac.identity`) from that keychain.
- **NOTARIZATION IS ON** (`mac.notarize: true`). It is notarized TWICE, and both
  passes are required: electron-builder notarizes + staples the **.app** inside
  the bundle, and a separate workflow step signs, notarizes and staples the
  **outer .dmg** — an un-notarized DMG fails Gatekeeper on download
  ("source=no usable signature") even when the app inside it is fine. A "Verify
  notarization" step gates the publish. electron-builder 25 reads the team id
  from the `APPLE_TEAM_ID` env var — do NOT use `notarize.teamId`, it warns +
  stalls; `APPLE_ID`/`APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD`/`APPLE_TEAM_ID` live in the
  Codemagic `mantaui` env group. A LOCAL `electron-builder --mac` with no
  credentials will fail the notarize step — override with
  `-c.mac.notarize=false` for a signed-only local build. (Historical: this was
  OFF during the beta because the notarization queue added 20-40 min of
  unpredictable latency and testers right-click → Open'd instead.)
- **Publish to prod** (`Publish to mantaui.com` step): scp's the DMG +
  `latest-mac.yml` to `/var/www/mantaui/{updates,downloads}` and refreshes
  `Manta-latest.dmg` (arm64 preferred). Gated on `PROD_SSH_KEY` (base64 SSH key
  in the Codemagic `mantaui` group) — no key → step no-ops and the DMG is only
  in Codemagic artifacts. Public download: **https://mantaui.com/downloads/Manta-latest.dmg**;
  electron-updater feed: `https://mantaui.com/updates/latest-mac.yml`.
- **Codemagic env group is named `mantaui`** (single group holds CSC_LINK,
  CSC_KEY_PASSWORD, APPLE_ID, APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD, APPLE_TEAM_ID,
  PROD_SSH_KEY). `codemagic.yaml` references it by that exact name — a mismatch
  fails instantly with "unknown variable group(s)".
- Desktop bundle id + icon: `appId: com.antoinedc.mantaui` (aligned with iOS,
  `electron-builder.yml` + `app.setAppUserModelId`). Icon is the navy-square
  manta mark (`assets/icon.icns` + `assets/icons/*.png`, regenerated from the
  iOS AppIcon).

### Checking for updates — two independent systems, one button

The desktop app and the box update themselves through **completely separate
mechanisms with separate manifests**, and conflating them is the main way to get
lost here:

| | Desktop app | Box server |
|---|---|---|
| Mechanism | electron-updater (Squirrel.Mac / NSIS) | `scripts/self-update.sh` |
| Manifest | `updates/latest-mac.yml` (per-platform) | `updates/server.json` (detect) + `releases/manta-latest.txt` (apply) |
| Compares | app version vs feed version | version (detect) / **git commit** (apply) |
| Triggered by | `autoUpdateCheck` → `autoUpdateDownload` → `autoUpdateInstall` | `serverUpdateCheck` → `serverUpdateApply` |

They can and routinely do disagree (as of 0.0.36 the box manifest was a version
ahead of the desktop feed) — that is expected, not a bug.

**Settings → About runs both in parallel behind one "Check for updates"
button**, with `Promise.allSettled` so one leg failing still reports the other,
and renders a tone-coded row per target. The tone is load-bearing: "up to date"
and "couldn't check" both render as a sentence with no button, so without the
colour they read identically — and a reassuring silence over a failed check is
precisely how a permanently broken macOS updater passed for a healthy one.
`describeDesktopUpdate` / `describeServerUpdate` (pure, in `chatUtils.ts`)
encode this — note `supported:false` (dev build, or mobile with no updater) maps
to **muted, never "ok"**: claiming a build is current is a statement about
something that was never checked.

Three rules that keep this honest:

- **The check must be AWAITABLE, not event-derived.** `checkForUpdates()`
  resolves with `{isUpdateAvailable, updateInfo}`. The `update-available` /
  `update-not-available` events cannot answer a specific button press (the
  not-available one was log-only), so an event-based button can only
  timeout-and-guess.
- **About never calls `serverUpdateApply()` itself.** Its "Update & restart"
  button raises `onRequestServerUpdate` and `App.tsx` runs its existing flow —
  the confirm dialog (which warns every running agent turn dies), the in-flight
  and progress state, the 120s safety cap, and `isTransientUpdateNetworkError`
  (without which a *successful* upgrade looks like a failure, since the box
  restarts mid-RPC). A second call site would be a second, subtly different copy
  of all of that.
- **The on-demand server check is the poller's OWN tick**
  (`startServerUpdatePoller` returns `{stop, check}`), not a second
  fetch+compare. So a manual check that finds an update also raises the normal
  banner and push (deduped per version), and the button and the banner can never
  report different things. The dedup gates the SIDE EFFECTS only — the verdict is
  always returned, so pressing twice answers twice.

**Poll cadence: 30 min with a conditional GET, not 6h with a full fetch.**
`defaultFetchManifest` sends `If-None-Match` and the website serves an ETag, so
a poll that finds nothing is a bodyless 304 — twelve of those an hour move less
data than one 200 every six hours did. The cadence is only the backstop for when
nobody is looking (it still fires the push). Latency at the moment that actually
matters comes from **checking on events, not on a clock**: the desktop runs a
check when its connection goes live and on every reconnect, so opening the app
surfaces a box release immediately. If you find yourself shortening the interval
to improve responsiveness, add an event-driven check instead.

Also note `createUpdateCheck`'s re-entrancy guard **joins** an in-flight tick
rather than returning `{available:false}` early. The early return was safe while
a 6h timer was the only caller and became a lie once a human could ask: a manual
check landing during a poll would report "up to date" with nothing compared.

### Windows desktop (`win-v*`) — GitHub-hosted, published as a GitHub Release

`.github/workflows/windows-desktop-build.yml`, on `windows-latest`. Builds the
NSIS installer that `electron-builder.yml`'s `win:` block has always described
but that nothing ever built (`scripts/release/desktop.sh` passes `--mac
--linux`, and the Codemagic desktop workflow runs on a Mac).

- **A tag push publishes a GitHub Release; a manual dispatch does not.** The
  tag job creates a **prerelease** on the tag and attaches the `.exe` (via `gh`,
  no third-party action, no extra secret) — that release URL is the link you
  hand a tester. Prerelease is deliberate: the installer is unsigned and must
  not present itself as the project's latest official release. A dispatch run
  has no tag, so it uploads a workflow artifact and stops. Re-running the same
  tag re-uploads with `--clobber` rather than failing.
- **The repo is private, so a release asset needs a GitHub account to
  download.** That is the point — it is the internal channel. Nothing reaches
  mantaui.com: no download-page link, and `latest.yml` is never uploaded to
  `https://mantaui.com/updates/`, so a Windows build's auto-update check 404s.
  `src/main/autoUpdate.ts` only `console.warn`s on error, so that is invisible
  to the user — they simply never get an update and you re-send a release link.
  Both gaps are blocked on code signing, not on effort: an unsigned installer
  trips SmartScreen for every visitor. When an OV/EV certificate exists, add a
  publish job modelled on `server-tarball-deploy.yml` (scp → verify 200 + sha)
  and only then link it from the website.
- **`latest.yml` is still built, and its absence fails the job**, so the
  electron-updater feed is complete the day that happens.
- The installer filename has **no space** (`Manta-UI-<version>-x64.exe`), unlike
  the mac/linux artifacts: GitHub rewrites spaces in release-asset names to
  dots, and `Manta.UI-…exe` is a confusing thing to download.
- **electron-builder compiles nothing, and this is load-bearing.**
  `electron-builder.yml` sets `npmRebuild: false` and excludes `node-pty` from
  `files`. The desktop app imports exactly three packages at runtime
  (`electron`, `electron-updater`, `yaml`) — all pure JS; `node-pty` is a BOX
  SERVER dependency (`src/server/pty.mjs`, run by plain node) that the desktop
  never loads, and rebuilding it against Electron's ABI was pure waste. If a
  native dependency is ever added to the DESKTOP, `npmRebuild` must go back to
  `true`. Note this does NOT make the repo toolchain-free: `npm ci` still
  installs node-pty, whose own install script downloads a prebuilt binding and
  falls back to `node-gyp rebuild` — which is why the Codemagic mac workflow's
  `setuptools<81` step must stay.
- **`postinstall` is `node scripts/postinstall.mjs`.** The old inline
  `electron-rebuild … || true; bash …` could not run under `cmd.exe`, so
  `npm ci` failed on Windows before anything was built. The rebuild half was
  deleted rather than ported (see the bullet above); the script's only remaining
  job is the macOS dev-bundle rename, and it can never fail an install.
- Icon: `assets/icon.ico`, a multi-resolution (16→256) ICO generated by
  `scripts/gen-icons.py` from the same rounded white tile as the macOS/iOS
  icons. Windows applies no mask of its own, so the rounding is baked into the
  bitmap. Regenerate icons with `python3 scripts/gen-icons.py` — it rewrites
  every platform's icons deterministically, so an unrelated asset should show
  no diff.
- x64 only. Windows-on-ARM emulates x64 and there is no arm64 tester.

### Website (`web-v*`) — GitHub-hosted, static file sync

`.github/workflows/website-deploy.yml`. **WHY IT EXISTS:** Caddy on the prod box
serves `/var/www/mantaui` (the WEBROOT), NOT the `/opt/manta` git clone — so a
`git pull` on the box does NOTHING for the site; files must be COPIED into the
webroot. Before this workflow that copy was a hand-run `scripts/release/publish.sh`
step, which is exactly why merged site/install changes silently never went live.
The workflow scp's `website/*.{html,png}` + `scripts/install.sh` +
`llms-install.md` into the webroot, then VERIFIES each URL is 200 AND
byte-matches the repo (`sha256`), failing red on any mismatch. Runs on
GitHub-hosted `ubuntu-latest` (this repo is PUBLIC — free) and SSHes to prod
with the `PROD_SSH_KEY` repo secret (private half of the deploy key; public
half is in the prod box's `authorized_keys`), written to `/tmp/prod_key` (0600)
per job. Verified assets: `/` (index), `privacy.html`, `terms.html`,
`install.sh`, `llms-install.md`.

### Push gateway (`gateway-v*`) — GitHub-hosted, pull + restart + health-check

`.github/workflows/gateway-deploy.yml`. The gateway runs
`node /opt/manta/src/gateway/index.mjs` as systemd `manta-gateway` on the prod
box (`/opt/manta` is a clone tracking `origin/main`). Deploy = `git -C
/opt/manta reset --hard origin/main` + `systemctl restart manta-gateway`, then
health-poll `GET gateway.mantaui.com/healthz`: any 200 means "up"; a connection
failure after ~30s of retries FAILS the workflow. **Kept SEPARATE from `web-v*`
on purpose:** restarting the gateway only interrupts in-flight APNs deliveries
(brief — APNs retries for the window), so a static website copy must never
bounce it — only tag `gateway-v*` when gateway code the service runs actually
changed. Same GitHub-hosted `ubuntu-latest` + `PROD_SSH_KEY` secret.

The gateway is the ONLY thing the operated backend still does post-BET-198
("drop the relay"): phones connect directly to `https://<box_id>.boxes.mantaui.com`
(Caddy on the box reverse-proxies 127.0.0.1:8787), and the box fans out
APNs via `POST gateway.mantaui.com/push` with a `gateway_token` it got back
from `POST /register` at install time. Web Push (VAPID, for the PWA) stays
box-local and unchanged — it doesn't touch the gateway.

### Staging channel — ON DEMAND ONLY, never auto-fires (BET-371)

A parallel `staging/` subtree on the SAME prod webroot (`/var/www/mantaui/staging/...`),
served as `https://mantaui.com/staging/...` from the existing Caddy vhost —
no new host, no DNS, no TLS cert. Staging is **manual-only**: it never fires on
a push, merge, or tag. Tag triggers (`web-v*`, `server-v*`, `mac-v*`) keep
meaning **prod**; staging is triggered by hand after the spec change lands.

**URL layout** (one prefix, three artifact dirs, mirroring prod):
| Artifact | prod destination | staging destination |
|---|---|---|
| `install.sh`, `llms-install.md` | `/var/www/mantaui/` | `/var/www/mantaui/staging/` |
| server tarballs + manifest | `/var/www/mantaui/releases/` | `/var/www/mantaui/staging/releases/` |
| desktop update feed + DMG | `/var/www/mantaui/updates/` | `/var/www/mantaui/staging/updates/` |
| desktop canonical download | `Manta-latest.dmg` (under `downloads/`) | `Manta-Staging-latest.dmg` (under `staging/downloads/`) |

**Triggers (three commands, no new workflow files):**
```
# Website — current main → /var/www/mantaui/staging
gh workflow run website-deploy.yml -f channel=staging
# Server tarballs — rebuilds all arches natively + publishes
gh workflow run server-tarball-deploy.yml -f channel=staging
# Desktop DMG — Codemagic REST API (no GitHub action); overrides MANTA_CHANNEL=staging
CMK=$(secret_provide CODEMAGIC_API_KEY)
curl -s -X POST -H "x-auth-token: $(cat $CMK)" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"appId":"6a5bfe08d7050a29d2f33802","workflowId":"mac-desktop","branch":"main",\
       "environment":{"variables":{"MANTA_CHANNEL":"staging"}}}' \
  https://api.codemagic.io/builds
```
Each workflow carries a `/staging/` guard step that fails RED if `channel=staging`
and the resolved destination path lacks `/staging/` — a staging run that
silently writes to prod is the only dangerous failure mode, and the guard makes
it impossible rather than unlikely. The mac-desktop build's overlay
(`electron-builder.staging.yml`, created in BET-370) changes appId +
productName + URL scheme + update-feed URL + dmg filename so staging can
install side-by-side with prod on the same Mac.

### Staging TEST BOX — disposable, reset it freely

`dev@135.181.255.249` (Hetzner `ubuntu-2gb-hel1-1`) is a **throwaway staging
box** used to test the installer, pairing, and the mobile/desktop clients
end-to-end against a real box that is NOT anyone's working machine. **It carries
no work worth keeping: wipe it, re-install it, revoke its tokens, restart its
services, change its config — no coordination needed.** Do NOT do any of that to
the dev box (`dev@157.90.224.92`) or the prod box.

- Installed the normal user way (`curl mantaui.com/install.sh | bash`), so it
  is a plain box install at `~/manta` (runtime node at
  `~/manta/runtime/node/bin/node`), NOT a git clone of this repo. There is no
  `~/projects/better-ui` on it.
- Services are `systemd --user`: `manta-server` (127.0.0.1:8787) and
  `opencode-serve`. Restart with `systemctl --user restart manta-server`.
- Public ingress is the standard gateway path: `~/.manta/ingress.json` is
  `{"mode":"public"}` and `~/.manta/auth.json` carries `gateway_host`
  `<box_id>.boxes.mantaui.com` — i.e. the box is reachable from a phone /
  simulator over HTTPS with no tunnel. `GET /` returns **401** from outside;
  that is the auth gate working, not a broken box.
- Pair a client against it by minting a code ON the box —
  `ssh dev@135.181.255.249 'curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8787/auth/pair'` — then
  entering the code plus the `https://<box_id>.boxes.mantaui.com` server URL in
  the client. `/auth/pair` is loopback-only by design, so the SSH hop is
  mandatory.
- Its SSH host key changes whenever it is reimaged. A
  `REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED` warning for this IP is expected —
  `ssh-keygen -R 135.181.255.249` and reconnect.

### Prod box topology (why deploys are shaped this way)

- **Prod box** `root@91.107.196.2` (Hetzner "manta"), zone `mantaui.com`.
- **`/opt/manta`** = git clone tracking `origin/main`. The GATEWAY runs from
  here. A `git pull` here updates gateway code (needs a service restart to take
  effect) but does NOT update the served website.
- **`/var/www/mantaui`** = Caddy WEBROOT, served statically per-request. Only
  files explicitly copied here go live: `index.html`/`privacy.html`/`terms.html`
  (from `website/`), `install.sh` (from `scripts/`), `llms-install.md`,
  `Manta-latest.dmg` + `latest-mac.yml` (desktop), `releases/*` (tarballs).
- **Caddyfile is NOT in the repo** — it lives only on the box (`/etc/caddy/`),
  unversioned. `gateway.mantaui.com` (gateway) and one
  `<box_id>.boxes.mantaui.com` per registered box have their own Caddy
  blocks there. (The old dedicated serve-page vhost was retired in BET-343 —
  pages now share the box's own hostname on the `/pages/<sub>` path, so no
  wildcard DNS record, no OVH DNS-01 cert, no extra port.)
- **`scripts/release/publish.sh`** is the OLDER manual all-in-one deploy
  (tarball + desktop + server + install.sh, run from a laptop over
  `MANTA_PROD_HOST`). The tag-driven workflows above supersede it for
  site/gateway/desktop; the Linux box server tarball is now ALSO built by the
  `server-v*`-tagged `.github/workflows/server-tarball-deploy.yml` workflow
  (both x64 + arm64, built natively on a GitHub-hosted matrix + merged into a
  single two-arch manifest before publish). `publish.sh` remains the manual
  full-release path — the loop over `linux-x64`/`linux-arm64` covers the same
  arches, and preflight refuses to publish unless BOTH are present.

### A clean install runs the RELEASE's source, not `main`'s

**A box's dependencies come from the release tarball and nowhere else** — it
has no compiler and never runs an install step of its own. So the source tree
must be the one those dependencies were built for. `install.sh` extracts the
tarball, then re-materialises the full source from git at **the release's own
commit** (`git_sha` in `RELEASE.json`), falling back to `origin/main` only for
a tarball old enough to carry no stamp.

It used to reset to `origin/main` unconditionally, which paired TODAY's source
with the LAST RELEASE's dependencies. The consequence is worth stating plainly
because nothing about it is visible from the repo: **from the moment any PR
adds a dependency until the next release is published, EVERY clean install is
broken — on prod as well as staging** — while already-installed boxes are
perfectly fine, because their update path takes source and dependencies
together from one tarball. The box dies on an unresolved import before it can
bind, so the only symptom is the installer's "server did not become healthy"
timeout pointing at `systemctl status`. That is what happened on 2026-08-15
(the plan-page work added four packages).

Two consequences to keep in mind:

- **Merging does not ship server code to new boxes; publishing a release
  does.** That was already true of existing boxes and is now uniformly true.
- **A dependency added to `package.json` reaches a box only through a new
  tarball.** No box ever resolves one at runtime.

A preflight (`check_release_dependencies` in install.sh, `findMissingDependencies`
in install-lib.mjs) backstops the rest of the class — a fork via
`MANTA_REPO_URL`, a hand-run `git pull`, a half-extracted tarball — by naming
the missing packages at install time instead of leaving a health timeout.

### The public install path is all-or-nothing (BET-980)

**An install either completes its chosen ingress path fully, or it fails —
there is no degraded success.** A public-path box needs a Debian/Ubuntu-family
distro AND the ability to run commands as root (real root or `sudo -n true`).
Those two capability checks run in a **preflight (scripts/install.sh step 3.5)
BEFORE the first mutation**, so a box that would finish unreachable instead
refuses to start with nothing written and nothing to roll back. The tailscale
and macOS paths never need root or a specific distro and are unaffected. Mid-
path public failures (gateway registration, the DNS poll, the Caddy vhost
write/reload) are all fatal too — `die`, never warn-and-continue — so the
"Installed." banner and pairing block are only reachable on a genuinely
complete install. Do not reintroduce a degrade-and-continue flag (the old
degraded-success handling was deleted with this rule).

### The sudo strategy machine + `~/.manta-sudo-pass` contract (BET-979)

**How the installer runs commands as root.** All privileged calls in
`scripts/install.sh` go through `sudo_priv`, which dispatches on a single
`SUDO_STRATEGY` resolved ONCE in the 3.5 preflight (before the first
mutation) by `resolve_sudo_strategy`:

| Strategy | Condition |
|---|---|
| `root` | already `uid 0` — commands run bare |
| `askpass` | `~/.manta-sudo-pass` exists — `sudo -A` ($SUDO_ASKPASS echoes the staged password) |
| `nopasswd` | `sudo -n true` succeeds — `sudo -n` |
| `tty` | a human's interactive terminal (`curl … \| bash`) — `sudo` reads the password from `/dev/tty` |
| `none` | nothing usable — the public path refuses to start (BET-980's fatal) |

The desktop installs with `MANTA_NONINTERACTIVE=1`, so strategy 4 (tty) is
never taken from the app — it only ever uses root / askpass / nopasswd. The
desktop's TS side mirrors this as `PreflightProbes.sudoAccess` (`root` |
`nopasswd` | `password` | `none`); `password` means the desktop shows the
sudo modal.

**`~/.manta-sudo-pass` is a cross-process contract** between the desktop and
install.sh — never persist it on the desktop, never log it, never put it in a
`send()` payload. Flow: the desktop stages the password to the box over a
**separate, short ssh call** (`WRITE_SUDO_PASS_CMD`, delivered via stdin, not
argv so it is invisible to `ps`), then runs the install (`sudo_priv` →
`askpass` sidesteps the forced-pty so sudo doesn't hang on a tty prompt via
`-A`), then deletes it (`CLEAR_SUDO_PASS_CMD`, always — success, failure,
cancel, decline, renderer disconnect). install.sh owns the SUDO_ASKPASS
helper itself and also removes the file on an EXIT trap. The desktop never
recreates the privileged call sites; `sudo_priv` is the only place that
invokes sudo (plus the `sudo -n true` capability probe in the strategy
resolver).

### A release is identified by its COMMIT, not its version number

**You do not need to bump `package.json` to ship a server release.** A box
decides whether it is already running the published build by comparing the
commit that build was made from — `git_sha`, stamped into both `RELEASE.json`
(what the box is running) and `releases/manta-latest.txt` (what is published).
Same commit → skip, no download. Different commit → update, even when both
sides carry the same version string.

This replaced a version-only comparison, which had a silent and expensive
failure mode: a release cut without a version bump was indistinguishable from
the installed one, so `self-update.sh` reported `already at <version>` and
every box skipped a REAL update. Nothing errored, no workflow went red, and
the only symptom was that the fix never appeared in production — which on
2026-08-15 read as "the merged PR didn't work" and sent a debugging session
after application code that was already correct.

Consequences worth knowing:

- **`version` is now purely a human/compatibility concern.** It still drives
  the desktop↔box compatibility matrix (`src/shared/compatibility.mjs`), so
  bump it for a real release; just don't rely on it to move code onto boxes.
- **Two published releases may legitimately share a version.** Log lines
  therefore print the commit alongside it — `0.0.29 → 0.0.29` alone reads like
  a no-op.
- **The decision is `release_is_current` in `scripts/lib/release.sh`** (pure,
  unit-tested in `release.test.mjs`), not inline in `self-update.sh`. It falls
  back to comparing versions when EITHER side has no commit — a box installed
  before stamps existed, or a tarball packed outside a git checkout — so the
  behaviour is never worse than before.
- **Never publish a manifest whose `git_sha` covers only some arches.**
  `merge-manifest.mjs` drops the key entirely unless every sidecar agreed, and
  hard-fails if two arches report different commits. A partial stamp is worse
  than none: a box whose own arch shipped unstamped would never match the
  published sha and would reinstall the same tarball on every check, forever.
- Two arches built from different commits is now a hard publish error rather
  than something only a version mismatch could have caught.

### Self-update also upgrades the opencode binary (BET-1016)

opencode is no longer frozen at install time — `scripts/self-update.sh` now
runs `opencode upgrade` (the CLI command on the installed binary) as part of
every update, so a box stops drifting from whatever it was installed with
(measured 2026-08-16: installed 1.18.10 vs latest upstream 1.18.18). Key facts:

- **Non-fatal**: an offline box, a missing CLI, or a refused upgrade logs a
  warning and continues — the box update must never be aborted by opencode
  (dry-run rule: mirrors `refresh_opencode_tools()`).
- **Runs BEFORE the packaged-install early exit**, and that early exit is now
  conditional on BOTH the box being current AND opencode being unchanged —
  otherwise an opencode-only upgrade would be swallowed by the cheap exit and
  the upgraded (but un-restarted) binary would stay inert. The decision is
  `should_skip_self_update` in `scripts/lib/release.sh` (pure, unit-tested
  alongside `release_is_current`).
- **opencode is unpinned by design** — never pin a version; the whole point is
  following upstream.
- **The upgrade is surfaced through the EXISTING shared update banner**: the
  server maps opencode's `installation.update-available` event onto the same
  `serverUpdateAvailable` bus event, dedup-gated per opencode version
  (`createOpencodeUpdateForwarder` in `src/server/serverUpdate.mjs`). No second
  banner variant, no new confirm copy — the existing "Update the box?" flow
  already warns it restarts opencode and ends running agent turns, which is
  exactly right for this.

### The box tells Anthropic which Claude Code version it is (BET-1503)

opencode reaches Anthropic through the `opencode-claude-auth` plugin, which
authenticates **as Claude Code** and therefore sends a Claude Code version in
its user-agent and billing headers. That version is HARDCODED in the plugin
(`config.ccVersion`) and lags badly — a live box's cached `@latest` claimed
`2.1.185`, and even the newest published plugin claims `2.1.217`.

**Anthropic gates new models on a minimum client version and refuses anything
below it.** So a stale claim makes a model the user is entitled to simply
unusable, with an error that misdirects: *"Claude Code 2.1.185 does not support
this model; version 2.1.251 or newer is required. Run 'claude update'"* — which
sends the user to update a CLI that is already current and has nothing to do
with it. That is the whole reason this exists; the box's real `claude` binary
was 2.1.257 at the time.

The plugin honours `ANTHROPIC_CLI_VERSION` from its environment, so the box
sets it on the opencode service. Four things about how:

- **The value is DERIVED, never pinned.** `resolve_anthropic_cli_version` in
  `scripts/lib/release.sh` reads the box's own `claude --version` and uses it
  when it meets `manta_claude_cli_version_floor`, else the floor. Since
  self-update already keeps that CLI current (unpinned, upgraded every run),
  the claim tracks it on its own. **Do not replace this with a constant** —
  Anthropic raises the floor with every model launch, and a constant means a
  release each time plus a window where every box is broken again. The floor is
  only the fallback for a box with no CLI (install.sh no longer installs one —
  the app does, lazily, on first Claude sign-in) or one older than the gate.
- **Three supervisors must agree.** The systemd unit, the LaunchAgent plist and
  install.sh's `nohup` fallback all set it, exactly like
  `OPENCODE_EXPERIMENTAL_BACKGROUND_SUBAGENTS` — otherwise behaviour would
  depend on which one happened to start opencode. A test pins the templates and
  install.sh's substitutions together, so a template that loses its placeholder
  goes red instead of rendering a literal `@@ANTHROPIC_CLI_VERSION@@`.
- **Existing boxes are patched IN PLACE, because self-update never re-renders
  units.** `ensure_opencode_cli_version` edits the installed unit (or plist)
  and reloads before the restart — same shape and same reasoning as
  `ensure_server_kill_policy`. It is monotonic: a stale claim is replaced, a
  higher one is never walked back. On macOS it uses PlistBuddy and must
  bootout+bootstrap, since `launchctl kickstart -k` restarts the job from
  launchd's STALE in-memory definition and would silently change nothing.
- **self-update re-sources the lib after a payload swap.** The script sources
  `release.sh` at the top — i.e. the copy from BEFORE the swap — so without the
  re-source a helper shipped by the very release being installed would not be
  defined, and the fix would land one update late. install.sh already had the
  same re-source for the same reason.
- **The resolver ships in install.sh's inline `curl | bash` fallback**, via
  `HELPER_NAMES` in `scripts/sync-release-fallback.mjs`. Piped mode has no
  local lib to source, so a resolver missing there would render an EMPTY value
  on the primary install path. The patcher functions are deliberately absent
  from that list: only self-update calls them, and it always sources the lib.

If a model starts failing this way again, check what the box actually claims
(`systemctl --user show opencode-serve -p Environment`) before touching
anything else — and note the number in the error is the plugin's claim, never
the CLI's real version.

### Verifying a deploy actually landed

Never trust "the workflow was green" alone for the FIRST run of a new pipeline —
check the live artifact:
```
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" https://mantaui.com/llms-install.md   # web
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" https://mantaui.com/downloads/Manta-latest.dmg  # desktop
# server — there is NO `manta-latest-<arch>.tar.gz`; those URLs 404. The only
# stable name is the manifest, which names the VERSIONED tarball per arch:
curl -s https://mantaui.com/releases/manta-latest.txt   # version= + file_/sha256_ per arch
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" https://mantaui.com/releases/manta-<version>-linux-x64.tar.gz
curl -fsS https://gateway.mantaui.com/healthz    # gateway → {"ok":true}
node /tmp/opencode/asc.mjs   # (on the box) — ASC build state for iOS (VALID = really uploaded)
```
For byte-parity, `sha256sum` the live file vs the repo copy (the web workflow
already does this and fails red on drift).

## macOS box (BET-274) — design decisions, do not re-derive

The installer supports macOS (Apple Silicon only) as a box OS alongside Linux.
Don't re-litigate these — they're fixed by the BET-274 epic and a regression on
any of them breaks the macOS path.

- **Apple Silicon only.** `resolve_arch` in `scripts/install.sh` maps
  `(uname -s=Darwin, uname -m=arm64)` → `darwin_arm64`; an Intel Mac
  (`Darwin + x86_64`) dies immediately with a clear "Apple Silicon only"
  message pointing at the desktop app. There is no `darwin-x64` build
  target and there is no plan to add one.
- **Service manager = `launchd` LaunchAgents, NOT systemd.** The two
  services run as per-user LaunchAgents under
  `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.mantaui.{server,opencode}.plist`
  (templates in `scripts/launchd/`). Loaded with `launchctl bootstrap
  gui/$(id -u) <plist>`, restarted with
  `launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/<label>`. The Linux `systemd
  --user` path is gated on `command -v systemctl`; macOS never has it,
  so `install.sh` branches to `elif [ "$IS_MACOS" = "1" ]` for both
  service installs. `self-update.sh` mirrors the same three-way branch
  (`systemctl` → `launchctl` → manual warn). **LaunchAgents load at GUI
  login and survive reboot as long as the user is logged in** — a
  headless-never-logs-in Mac is unsupported (no `enable-linger` analog;
  LaunchDaemon requires root and is out of scope).
- **Loopback + Tailscale-only ingress.** The Caddy/apt/DNS/gateway-TLS
  privileged section (install.sh 7.5 A/D/E) is gated on a single
  `SKIP_PUBLIC_TLS` predicate, which merges the macOS case with the
  existing tailscale case: both skip the public TLS sub-steps. **The
  gateway-register sub-steps B/C STILL RUN on macOS** — they are
  user-space and the gateway_token is still needed for APNs push.
  `hostname -I` (BSD-incompatible), `ss -tlnH`, `loginctl
  enable-linger`, and the Caddyfile `sed -i` (which is GNU-only) are
  all inside OS-guarded blocks and macOS never reaches them. Confirmed
  by the audit in BET-278 item #4. **Do not bypass the
  `SKIP_PUBLIC_TLS` gate** — the macOS install dies on `:80`/`:443`
  binding without sudo, and there's no path to making public TLS work
  on macOS in v1.
- **`darwin-arm64` tarball built on `macos-14` GitHub runner.** The
  `server-tarball-deploy.yml` workflow matrix is
  `[x64, arm64, darwin-arm64]`, with `runs-on` switching to
  `macos-14` for the darwin leg. Cannot cross-compile: node-pty's
  native ABI is host-tied, so the macOS build MUST run on a Mac.
  Don't add a `darwin-x64` job — Apple Silicon Macs are the only ones
  we ship a box for.
- **Arch resolution single-source-of-truth.** Three files share the
  same arch map and MUST stay in sync:
  - `scripts/install.sh` `resolve_arch` → `linux_x64` | `linux_arm64` |
    `darwin_arm64` (the underscore form is the manifest key).
  - `scripts/release/pack.mjs` `resolveArch` → `{ key: "...", file: "..."
    }`, where `file` is the hyphen form used in tarball filenames
    AND nodejs.org's `node-v<v>-<file>.tar.gz` token
    (`darwin-arm64`).
  - The combined manifest (`file_darwin_arm64=` + `sha256_darwin_arm64=`
    keys) emitted by `scripts/release/merge-manifest.mjs` and the
    `server-v*` workflow.
  If you rename or re-shape any of these three, do it in all three in
  the same PR — `install.sh`'s `manifest_get "$manifest" "file_$ARCH_KEY"`
  assumes the underscored key exists in the manifest, and the workflow's
  matrix value is what the tarball filename uses.

## Plugins — YAML manifests (v2, BET-189)

User/AI-authored YAML manifests at `~/.manta/plugins/<name>.yaml` on the
**machine the user wants to drive** (today: only the connected Mac —
`host:"mac"` is the only accepted value). Replaces the v1 TypeScript handler
model (BET-183/184/185): `src/main/handlers/iosBuild.ts` and the `HANDLERS`
map are gone. A plugin is now one YAML file; the executor reads every
`*.yaml` in the folder on startup + on every `fs.watch` burst and dispatches
matching capabilities. The generic job spine (`src/server/capabilities.mjs`,
`/api/cap*`, SSE envelopes, sweep, completion-notify) is **byte-identical**
to v1 — v2 only changed what runs inside the executor.

**Read first**: `docs/mantaui-plugins.md` (spec v3 — constants + the
shared-manifest module + execution semantics) and
`docs/plugins-authoring.md` (author-facing schema reference). Constants live
in `mantaui-plugins.md` and there only.

### Manifest schema + grammar limits

- **One YAML file, validated by a shared module.**
  `src/shared/pluginManifest.mjs` is the single source of truth — imported
  by BOTH `src/main/capExecutor.ts` (the executor that reads manifests off
  disk and runs them) and `src/server/plugins.mjs` (the in-memory registry
  the renderer reads). Pure functions only, no `electron`/`node:fs` deps
  beyond YAML parsing + `resolveCwd`'s existence check. Every public
  function is unit-tested in `src/shared/pluginManifest.test.ts`.
- **Grammar limits are deliberate — extensions are refused on principle.**
  The `if:` expression has EXACTLY three forms (`inputs.<id>`,
  `inputs.<id> == <token>`, `inputs.<id> != <token>`). No `${{ }}`, no
  operators, no functions, no function-call forms. Unknown top-level or
  per-step keys fail validation with `unknown key "<key>"` — typo
  protection. If a use case seems to demand a new grammar form, that's a
  MantaUI change, not a plugin change.
- **`host` accepts ONLY `"mac"` in v2.** Anything else fails with
  `host: only "mac" is supported`. Other hosts are not implemented;
  adding them is a design decision.

### Shared-module rule

`src/shared/pluginManifest.mjs` is the only place that parses + validates
manifests and computes `buildEnv`/`resolveCwd`/`evalIf`. **Never copy
manifest logic into the executor or the server.** Adding a new validation
rule there is reflected in every consumer and every test. The single
exception is `host`-routing in the executor — `plugin.write` is a
built-in that runs the same validator, writes the YAML to
`~/.manta/plugins/<name>.yaml`, and rescans.

### Hot reload + registry publish

- The executor `fs.watch`es `~/.manta/plugins/` (500ms debounce) and
  rescans on change, at startup, and on every SSE (re)connect.
- After every scan, the executor PUTs `/api/plugins/registry` to
  manta-server (Bearer auth, same header helper) with the current rows
  — including INVALID manifests with their `error` so Settings and
  `plugin_list` can show parse failures. Server keeps it in-memory only
  (`src/server/plugins.mjs`); the executor republishes on every reconnect,
  covering server restarts.
- Adding/editing a YAML does NOT require restarting MantaUI or the
  executor.

### `plugin.write` built-in

The only hard-coded capability in v2 is `plugin.write`: a `capability:"plugin.write"`
job validates its YAML payload, writes `~/.manta/plugins/<name>.yaml`,
rescans, and returns `{name, valid: true}` — or the validator errors
verbatim. Everything else is a manifest lookup. The runner has NO
`HANDLERS` map and NO `CapHandler`/`CapCtx` indirection — only a
`plugin.write` branch and the manifest runner. Adding capability #N is
writing one YAML file, not editing TypeScript.

### Trust model (toggle only)

The "Run plugins on this machine" toggle in **Settings → Plugins** (desktop
only, `MobileSettings.tsx` untouched) is the ONLY gate. Default OFF. The
executor gates itself at startup on `pluginsEnabled`. With the toggle
OFF, the plugin system is dormant: no scan, no registry publish, no job
dispatch. There is no per-plugin confirmation — every plugin under
`~/.manta/plugins/` runs whatever commands it says. The folder is treated
like `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`: only the user (or the AI on their explicit
request) puts files there.

The config rename `capExecutorEnabled` → `pluginsEnabled` is a one-time
migration in `src/main/config.ts` (`src/shared/configMigration.mjs` is the
electron-free, unit-tested core). The v1 fields `iosBuildRepoPath` /
`iosSimulatorName` were DROPPED — there is no auto-generation of a
manifest from the legacy fields; the user re-authors once via the AI.

### Deletion of the TS handler layer (BET-189's hard rule)

The deletion list at the bottom of BET-189 is a deliverable, not a
suggestion. v1's `HANDLERS` map + `CapHandler` type consumers in
`capExecutor.ts`, the per-plugin TypeScript handlers, and the v1 AI tool
`ios_build` are gone. Re-adding ANY of them is the wrong fix — extend the
shared manifest module instead. Adding a new executor host is a v3
decision.

### Sweep-alignment timeout cap (30 min)

`parseTimeout` in `src/shared/pluginManifest.mjs` caps manifest timeouts
at 30 minutes. The reason: the server sweep
(`src/server/capabilities.mjs` `sweepCapJobs`) fails any `running` job at
30 min; a longer manifest timeout would be killed by the sweep anyway, so
raising the cap is impossible without raising the sweep (out of scope).
The executor's own per-job abort is 25 min — below the cap on purpose so
the Mac fails first and reports properly.

### macOS PATH gotcha (still true)

GUI-launched Electron apps do NOT inherit the user's shell PATH.
`Homebrew`/`nvm`-installed `npm`/`npx`/`pod` are invisible to a spawned
child and `exec` fails ENOENT even though the same command works in
Terminal. `capExecutor`'s `exec` builds its env as
`{...process.env, PATH: "/opt/homebrew/bin:/usr/local/bin:" + (process.env.PATH ?? "")}`
(Apple Silicon + Intel Homebrew). The ENOENT rejection message tells the
user to install via Homebrew — never silently swallow it.

### busConsumer (one SSE code path, still true)

`src/main/busConsumer.ts` is the ONLY SSE consumer in `src/main/`. Both
`desktopNotify` (filter `kind === "desktopNotify"`) and `capExecutor`
(filter `kind === "capJob"` + catch-up via `onConnect`) build on it. No
module-level singletons — each `createBusConsumer` call owns its own
state. `desktopNotify.ts` is ~40 lines; `capExecutor.ts` adds zero SSE
plumbing of its own.

## Mobile CSS hook-class contract (BET-415) — RETIRED (BET-559)

BET-559 deleted `mobile/mobile.css` and the web/PWA client that consumed it.

BET-578 stripped the hook classes that were genuinely dead (no mobile CSS, no
desktop CSS, and no other consumer): `manta-composer-meta/-trust/-textarea`
(InputArea), `manta-session-toolbar` (ComposerParts), `manta-ctx-track` and
`manta-stale-full/-min` (ContextBar), `manta-session-crumb/-branch` and the
bare `manta-session-menu` root + `manta-session-mode-toggle` hook (SessionHeader),
and the bare `manta-model-picker` root (ModelPicker).

The rest of the `manta-*` classes are **not** inert and were kept: the desktop
visual gate (`tests/visual/screens.mjs`) uses them as popup-trigger selectors
and surface-coverage markers (`assertSurfacesClosed` scans `[aria-haspopup]`
elements for the `manta-` prefix). Do not strip these without reconciling the
gate first:

- `manta-composer` (InputArea wrapper) — gate region
- `manta-model-picker-btn`, `manta-model-dropdown`, `manta-effort-picker-btn`,
  `manta-effort-dropdown` (ModelPicker) — gate actions/regions + coverage
- `manta-session-header`, `manta-ctx-pill`, `manta-ctx-popover`,
  `manta-session-menu-trigger`, `manta-session-menu-dropdown` (SessionHeader) —
  gate regions + coverage
- `manta-composer-input-row`, `manta-recording` —
  live desktop CSS in `src/renderer/index.css`
- `manta-folder-picker` (FolderPickerModal) — gate region/snapshot

Do not reintroduce `manta-*` classes as **mobile** CSS hooks: there is no
mobile client selecting on them anymore.

## Testing

Two separate test suites — both run via `npm test`:

**Renderer** (Vitest): `src/renderer/chatUtils.test.ts`. Pure utility
functions only — no DOM, no Electron mocking. When adding logic to
`ChatPanel.tsx` expressible as a pure function, extract to `chatUtils.ts`
and add a test there. `vitest.config.ts` excludes `src/server/**`.

**Server** (node:test): every `src/server/*.test.mjs`. Run standalone with
`npm run test:server`. Pure logic
only — no live tmux or opencode. Add tests for any new pure-parseable logic
in the server modules.

**THE SUITE RUNS ON A LIVE BOX — its state dirs are sandboxed, keep them that
way.** The tests execute as the same user, on the same machine, as a running
box, and this repo's CI runner IS the maintainer's dev box. Every server module
resolves its store from the state home (`~/.manta/auth.json`,
`secrets.json`, `schedule.json`, `webhooks.json`, `tmux-sessions.json`,
`cap-jobs.json`, plus `~/.manta-uploads` / `-outbox` / `-secrets`), so an
un-injected test writes PRODUCTION data. That is not hypothetical: an auth test
built an engine without injecting `saveAuth`/`deleteAuth` and called `revoke()`
with a matching token — the destructive path — so **every `npm test` deleted
`~/.manta/auth.json` and minted a fresh box identity**. The running server kept
the old token in memory, so the paired desktop/phone kept working while every
manta-native AI tool (they re-read `auth.json` per call) started returning
`unauthorized`, and the wiped `gateway_host`/`gateway_token` silently killed
APNs fanout. It recurred on every CI run for days before anyone connected the
two.

Two layers now stand between a test and the live box; do not remove either:

- **Injection discipline** (unchanged): a test that exercises persistence passes
  its own writers/paths. `auth.test.mjs`'s `engine()` helper is the pattern —
  every engine is built through it and stubs persistence by default.
- **The sandbox** (the layer under it): `stateHome()` in `src/shared/paths.mjs`
  honors `MANTA_STATE_HOME`, and both runners point it at a throwaway dir —
  `node --import ./scripts/testSandbox.mjs --test …` in the `test` /
  `test:server` scripts, and `test.env` in `vitest.config.ts`. Because module-
  level `statePath(...)` constants are computed at import, the env MUST be set
  before test modules load; that's the only reason the `--import` flag (not a
  `beforeEach`) is used. Production never sets the var, so it resolves to
  `$HOME` exactly as before — this is a test seam, not a configurable state dir.

Canaries fail RED if the wiring is dropped: `stateSandbox.test.mjs` (asserts
`MANTA_STATE_HOME` is set and that `auth.mjs`'s store resolved inside it) and
the equivalent case in `src/shared/paths.test.ts` for vitest. **New state files
must go through `statePath()` / `uploadRoot()` / `outboxRoot()` /
`secretsRoot()`** — a fresh `join(homedir(), STATE_DIRNAME, …)` re-opens the
hole for that store and no canary will notice.

## Custom opencode commands

Global commands (`~/.claude/commands/*.md`) are symlinked into
`~/.config/opencode/commands/` so opencode's `/command` API picks them up.
When adding a new command file: `ln -sf ~/.claude/commands/<name>.md ~/.config/opencode/commands/`
then restart `opencode-serve` for opencode to reload.

## Work tracking (Multica)

MantaUI has a Multica workspace for structured issue dispatch to AI agents.

- **Workspace**: https://multica.ai/better-ui (ID: `264c89bb-4659-4570-af7b-5f8daaf87985`)
- **Agents** (all OpenCode runtime):
  - `manta-dev` (ID: `ab49c3e2-0239-43cb-81cf-32d3ee9102f2`) — the single implementer, covers the full codebase
  - `manta-pm` (ID: `df781c72-9408-47e3-be9e-cfa317ed6bc9`) — delivery coordinator / decomposer / merger
  - `manta-reviewer` (ID: `f4605213-cc2e-4ab6-9e53-af6695174779`) — PR review gate
  - `manta-ops` (ID: `b3f61b23-bceb-4cba-8404-574cff90ee5b`) — board liveness (autopilot PAUSED since 2026-07-21)
- **Skill**: `verify-build-manta` (ID: `ef855df1-92f6-4cff-906f-80f8ab53b48e`) — runs `npm run typecheck && npm test`

**The implementer was renamed `better-ui-dev` → `manta-dev`** (the agent id changed
too — `87bf6d8f-…` is the retired one). Any doc, skill, or issue template still
saying `better-ui-dev` is stale; `multica issue assign … --to better-ui-dev` no
longer resolves.

**Source of truth**: `.multica/` directory in this repo. Edit files there, commit, then push to Cloud.

```bash
# Push updated agent instructions
multica agent update ab49c3e2-0239-43cb-81cf-32d3ee9102f2 \
  --instructions "$(cat .multica/agents/manta-dev.md)"

### Board self-healing — two cron sweeps, one failure mode

**Multica agents are event-triggered: a run starts when an issue is ASSIGNED to
an agent. Nothing polls on their behalf.** Every "the board is stuck again"
report so far traces back to that one fact — some transition was supposed to
fire and didn't, and no amount of correct-looking status will make it fire
later. Two deterministic CI sweeps close the loop. Neither is an agent, so
neither can itself go quiet:

| Sweep | Cadence | Fixes |
|---|---|---|
| `scripts/multica-unblock.mjs` (in `multica-close-on-merge.yml`) | hourly + after every merge | a `blocked` issue whose named blockers are all `done` → `todo` |
| `scripts/multica-unstick.mjs` (`multica-unstick.yml`) | every 15 min (throttled — see below), plus on every PR opened / marked ready | an agent-assigned `todo`/`in_progress`/`in_review` issue with nothing in flight and a terminal (or missing) run → re-dispatched to whoever owes the next move |
| `scripts/agent-branch-pr.mjs` (`agent-branch-pr.yml`) | on every push to `agent/**` or `multica/**` | a pushed agent branch with no pull request → one is opened for it |

The two are complementary and never act on the same issue: unblock owns
`blocked` and changes STATUS (plus the one assignment `next_owner` declares —
see below); unstick owns the live statuses and changes ASSIGNMENT. Unstick's routing mirrors the pipeline — implementer → reviewer,
reviewer → PM, stalled PM → re-run — and it refuses to act on human-assigned
issues, on anything with a run in flight, or twice on one issue inside two
hours. All the judgement is the pure `decideUnstick` / `screenIssue` pair,
unit-tested in `scripts/multica-unstick.test.mjs`.

**Why `todo` is in unstick's scope — the two sweeps would otherwise drop the
work between them.** A STATUS change dispatches nothing (only an assignment or a
comment does), so when unblock flips a `blocked` issue to `todo` it fixes the
label and starts nobody. The `todo` rule re-fires that issue's existing
assignment ~30 minutes later, which is what actually restarts the epic.

**Sequencing a chain of children — `next_owner`, NOT a pre-assignment.**
Assigning an issue DISPATCHES A RUN immediately, whatever its status (verified
live 2026-08-02: assigning a `blocked` issue started an agent on it seconds
later). So "who owns this next" and "start now" used to be the same act, leaving
a PM sequencing an epic only two bad options — start an agent before its
prerequisite exists, or leave the issue owned by nobody. **An unassigned issue is
invisible to BOTH sweeps** (unblock only writes status; unstick skips anything
not agent-assigned), so option two is a permanent silent stall: it is exactly
how BET-556..559 sat untouched while the iOS epic stopped dead. Parking the
issue on a HUMAN is the same dead end — unstick deliberately never pages an
agent about work a person has taken.

The fix is to keep the two apart. A queued child carries:

```
status:      blocked
waiting_on:  "BET-555 (S3a) must be done — …"     ← its real blockers
next_owner:  "macos"                               ← who starts it, later
```

unblock assigns `next_owner` at the moment the blockers clear, which is the one
moment dispatch-on-assign is correct. No `next_owner` → status-only, exactly as
before. An unresolvable name does NOT release the issue: it stays `blocked`
(and so stays in scope for a corrected value) rather than becoming an unowned
`todo` no sweep will ever revisit. Logic is the pure `resolveNextOwner`,
unit-tested in `scripts/multica-unblock.test.mjs`.

**`waiting_on` is machine-read — cite ONLY real blockers in it.** Every issue
key in that field is a blocker. Naming the parent epic for context ("per BET-550
stage order") deadlocks the child permanently: the epic cannot go `done` until
its children do. Self-references are dropped; a parent's key is
indistinguishable from a blocker's and is not. Rationale and stage ordering go
in the DESCRIPTION. Always `node scripts/multica-unblock.mjs --dry-run
--verbose` after editing a note — it prints the resolved blocker list per issue,
which is how this trap was caught.

**A branch is not a hand-off — CI opens the PR.** The `macos` worker is
forbidden from opening pull requests (it runs on a daily-driver laptop holding
signing certificates), and `.multica/agents/macos.md` declares the git branch to
be "the hand-off medium" that the Linux agents consume. Nothing consumed it:
BET-555 built cleanly, pushed `agent/macos/bbb581a9`, set itself `in_review`,
and the iOS epic stalled behind a branch no one could review. `agent-branch-pr.yml`
now carries ANY pushed `agent/**` / `multica/**` branch into a PR — which also
covers a run that dies between its push and its hand-off (BET-569 died exactly
there, leaving a green PR stuck as a draft). Two constraints on it:

- **It must use `BUNDLE_PUSH_TOKEN`, not `GITHUB_TOKEN`.** GitHub suppresses
  `pull_request` workflows for a PR opened with the default token, and `ci.yml`
  runs only on `pull_request` + pushes to `main` — so such a PR would carry NO
  checks while `typecheck-test` is the one required context. Permanently
  unmergeable is a worse failure than the stranded branch it replaced.
- **Multica links a PR by the key in its TITLE**, so the branch should be
  `multica/<KEY>-<slug>`; the key is otherwise recovered from commit subjects,
  and failing that the PR is opened unlinked with a warning.
- **`on: push` reads the workflow file from the PUSHED BRANCH, not `main`** — so
  a branch cut from a `main` that predates the workflow never triggers it. This
  bit BET-556 minutes after the workflow landed. Self-resolving as branches move
  forward; for an older branch use
  `gh workflow run agent-branch-pr.yml -f branch=<branch>`, which runs `main`'s
  copy. Applies to any branch-triggered workflow added here.

**The 15-minute schedule is fiction — assume hours.** GitHub throttles cron
hard: ticks 58-202 minutes apart on 2026-08-01, and a 66-minute gap on
2026-08-02 while three finished issues sat idle. `multica-unstick.yml` therefore
also runs on `pull_request` `opened`/`ready_for_review` — an implementer
finishing merges nothing, so the merge-event trigger never fires for it and the
throttled cron was the only thing left. Paired with `MULTICA_UNSTICK_PR_GRACE_MIN`
(3 min when the issue has a live PR, vs the 30 the no-PR case still gets, since
a terminal run plus a published PR is unambiguous), a dropped hand-off now
routes in minutes. Fork PRs carry no secrets, so the job skips them.

**These are backstops, not the mechanism.** Agents are still required to hand
off explicitly (`.multica/skills/manta-pr-workflow/SKILL.md` step 10); the sweep
costs 15-30 min of wall clock. A rising rate of unsticks (grep the workflow runs,
or the `unstick_*` metadata on issues) means an agent is systematically dropping
hand-offs — fix the agent, don't lean on the sweep.

**GOTCHA — a comment on an agent-assigned issue DISPATCHES A RUN** (`kind:
"comment"` in the task-run's attribution; verified live 2026-07-27). That is why
unstick records its ledger in `unstick_last` / `unstick_action` /
`unstick_reason` METADATA rather than the audit comment it originally posted:
after a reassign the comment queued a second run of the agent it had just woken,
and before a reassign it would wake the stalled agent being routed away from.
Metadata writes are inert. Anything automated that touches an agent-assigned
issue must account for this — a "harmless status comment" is an agent run.

**A decomposition issue — one whose deliverable is other issues — has exactly
one owner.** BET-484 and BET-475 both decomposed concurrently on 2026-08-01
(two assignments, or an assignment plus a comment, fired two runs and produced
two trees a human had to diff and cancel). Such an issue has one assignee and
is never re-assigned or re-dispatched while a run is in flight; before
decomposing, check whether the children already exist and stop rather than
filing a second set. If two trees do exist, they are reconciled by a human, not
by an agent picking one — an agent must not cancel another agent's issues.

**`manta-ops` is NOT part of this.** It's an agent driven by a Multica autopilot
that has been paused since 2026-07-21, so every recovery path its instructions
describe (`manta-pm.md` cases D and E) currently routes to nobody. The CI
sweeps exist precisely so board liveness doesn't depend on an agent being
switched on.

**Useful Multica REST endpoints** (all `Bearer $MULTICA_TOKEN`; the OpenAPI
surface is undocumented, so these were mapped by proxying the CLI):

```
GET  /api/issues?workspace_id=&status=&limit=      → {issues:[…]}
GET  /api/issues/BET-N                             → issue (id, status, assignee_id, metadata)
GET  /api/issues/BET-N/task-runs?workspace_id=     → [run…]  (NOT /runs)
GET  /api/issues/BET-N/pull-requests?workspace_id= → {pull_requests:[…]}  (state: draft|open|merged|closed)
PUT  /api/issues/BET-N?workspace_id=               → {status} or {assignee_id, assignee_type}
POST /api/issues/<uuid>/rerun?workspace_id=        → re-fire the current assignment
PUT  /api/issues/<uuid>/metadata/<key>?workspace_id= → {value}
POST /api/issues/BET-N/comments?workspace_id=      → {workspace_id, content}
```

Two traps that cost real debugging time: the comments route needs `workspace_id`
on the QUERY STRING (a body-only workspace 400s) and its field is **`content`**,
not `body` — the close-on-merge workflow shipped with both wrong plus a missing
`MULTICA_TOKEN` env, so its "closed without merge" comment had never once
posted. And `metadata` is not writable through a `PUT /issues/<key>` (it returns
200 and silently discards it) — use the dedicated per-key route above.

## Open work (as of 2026-05-18)

- **Open subagent as its own chat-mode window.** Phase 1 ships read-only
  inline subagent rendering (see "Subagent rendering" section above).
  Phase 2 is the "Open as session" affordance: a button on the TaskBody
  header that creates a fresh chat-mode tmux window stamped with the
  child's existing opencode sessionId — no new opencode session. The
  plumbing is server-side: `src/server/tmux.mjs` `newWindow` +
  `maybeCreateChatSession` (add an `existingSessionId` short-circuit so it
  stamps the child's id instead of creating a session); the
  `opencode:fork-session` handler in `src/server/rpc.mjs` is the template to
  copy minus the fork POST. Needs a new `opencode:adopt-session` `/rpc`
  channel + httpApi method, ensuring `rememberSessionDirectory`
  (`src/server/opencode.mjs`) runs so the per-directory SSE stream opens
  before the renderer mounts the panel.
- **Global model preference** — `AppConfig.defaultModel` (Settings UI, persisted to `config.json`). New sessions and `/clear` fall back to this when no per-session localStorage entry exists. `/clear` also carries the current per-session override forward to the new session id before refresh.
- **Live refresh polling** — sidebar updates only on MantaUI's own actions.
- **Command palette (⌘K)** — fuzzy switch + actions (~150 lines).
- **Reconnect-on-drop UI** — HTTPS has no reconnect banner today.
- **Mobile create flow** — `+` on the mobile session list currently only
  re-syncs; the new-session/new-project modal (desktop `Sidebar.tsx`) is not
  yet lifted into a mobile sheet.
