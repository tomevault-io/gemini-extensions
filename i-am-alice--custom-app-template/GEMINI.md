Create a model response
post
 
https://api.openai.com/v1/responses
Creates a model response. Provide text or image inputs to generate text or JSON outputs. Have the model call your own custom code or use built-in tools like web search or file search to use your own data as input for the model's response.

Request body
input
string or array

Required
Text, image, or file inputs to the model, used to generate a response.

Learn more:

Text inputs and outputs
Image inputs
File inputs
Conversation state
Function calling

Show possible types
model
string

Required
Model ID used to generate the response, like gpt-4o or o1. OpenAI offers a wide range of models with different capabilities, performance characteristics, and price points. Refer to the model guide to browse and compare available models.

include
array or null

Optional
Specify additional output data to include in the model response. Currently supported values are:

file_search_call.results: Include the search results of the file search tool call.
message.input_image.image_url: Include image urls from the input message.
computer_call_output.output.image_url: Include image urls from the computer call output.
instructions
string or null

Optional
Inserts a system (or developer) message as the first item in the model's context.

When using along with previous_response_id, the instructions from a previous response will not be carried over to the next response. This makes it simple to swap out system (or developer) messages in new responses.

max_output_tokens
integer or null

Optional
An upper bound for the number of tokens that can be generated for a response, including visible output tokens and reasoning tokens.

metadata
map

Optional
Set of 16 key-value pairs that can be attached to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format, and querying for objects via API or the dashboard.

Keys are strings with a maximum length of 64 characters. Values are strings with a maximum length of 512 characters.

parallel_tool_calls
boolean or null

Optional
Defaults to true
Whether to allow the model to run tool calls in parallel.

previous_response_id
string or null

Optional
The unique ID of the previous response to the model. Use this to create multi-turn conversations. Learn more about conversation state.

reasoning
object or null

Optional
o-series models only

Configuration options for reasoning models.


Show properties
store
boolean or null

Optional
Defaults to true
Whether to store the generated model response for later retrieval via API.

stream
boolean or null

Optional
Defaults to false
If set to true, the model response data will be streamed to the client as it is generated using server-sent events. See the Streaming section below for more information.

temperature
number or null

Optional
Defaults to 1
What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic. We generally recommend altering this or top_p but not both.

text
object

Optional
Configuration options for a text response from the model. Can be plain text or structured JSON data. Learn more:

Text inputs and outputs
Structured Outputs

Show properties
tool_choice
string or object

Optional
How the model should select which tool (or tools) to use when generating a response. See the tools parameter to see how to specify which tools the model can call.


Show possible types
tools
array

Optional
An array of tools the model may call while generating a response. You can specify which tool to use by setting the tool_choice parameter.

The two categories of tools you can provide the model are:

Built-in tools: Tools that are provided by OpenAI that extend the model's capabilities, like web search or file search. Learn more about built-in tools.
Function calls (custom tools): Functions that are defined by you, enabling the model to call your own code. Learn more about function calling.

Show possible types
top_p
number or null

Optional
Defaults to 1
An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.

We generally recommend altering this or temperature but not both.

truncation
string or null

Optional
Defaults to disabled
The truncation strategy to use for the model response.

auto: If the context of this response and previous ones exceeds the model's context window size, the model will truncate the response to fit the context window by dropping input items in the middle of the conversation.
disabled (default): If a model response will exceed the context window size for a model, the request will fail with a 400 error.
user
string

Optional
A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help OpenAI to monitor and detect abuse. Learn more.

Returns
Returns a Response object.
