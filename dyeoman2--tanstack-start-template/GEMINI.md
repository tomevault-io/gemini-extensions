# TanStack Start Agent Guide

## Core Philosophy

- Strong end-to-end type safety (database → server → router → client); no `any` or type casting.
- Server-first, progressively enhanced flows; UI hydrates cleanly but works without JS.
- Performance by design: static imports, parallel data fetching, targeted cache updates.

## Architecture

- `src/routes/`: File-based routes with loaders, guards, pending/error components.
- `src/features/`: Feature slices with UI, hooks, and server functions (`*.server.ts`).
- `src/lib/server/`: Server utilities (database, auth, email, env).
- `src/components/ui/`: Shadcn/ui primitives and shared components.
- Database access via Convex queries/mutations and `setupFetchClient`.

## Golden Rules

- Keep imports static and synchronous inside server modules; no dynamic imports in server functions.
- One server function, one responsibility. Compose higher-level flows by orchestrating smaller server functions.
- Use Convex queries/mutations for data operations with automatic type generation.
- Reuse provided auth guards (`routeAuthGuard`, `routeAdminGuard`, `requireAuth`, `requireAdmin`)—do not reimplement session checks.
- Keep UI components pure; business logic lives in hooks or server functions.
- Never commit files with git unless explicitly requested by the user.

## Key Patterns

### Routes

```ts
export const Route = createFileRoute('/app')({
  pendingMs: 150,
  pendingMinMs: 250,
  pendingComponent: ShellSkeleton,
  component: AppLayout,
  errorComponent: DashboardErrorBoundary,
});

function AppLayout() {
  const navigate = useNavigate();
  const location = useLocation();
  const { isAuthenticated, isPending } = useAuth();
  const redirectRef = useRef(false);
  const redirectTarget = location.href ?? '/app';

  useEffect(() => {
    if (isPending) return;

    if (!isAuthenticated) {
      if (redirectRef.current) return;

      redirectRef.current = true;
      void navigate({
        to: '/login',
        search: { redirect: redirectTarget },
        replace: true,
      }).catch(() => {
        redirectRef.current = false;
      });
    } else {
      redirectRef.current = false;
    }
  }, [isAuthenticated, isPending, navigate, redirectTarget]);

  if (isPending || !isAuthenticated) {
    return <ShellSkeleton />;
  }

  return (
    <AppChrome>
      <Outlet />
    </AppChrome>
  );
}
```

### Client Data + Convex Hooks

```ts
export function DashboardRoute() {
  const live = useQuery(api.dashboard.getDashboardData, {});

  if (live === undefined) {
    return <DashboardSkeleton />;
  }

  if (live === null) {
    return <DashboardAccessFallback />;
  }

  return <Dashboard data={live} />;
}
```

### Marketing SSG + App SPA Flow

- Public marketing/auth routes use `staticData: true` for static HTML.
- `/app` routes run as an SPA: components call Convex `useQuery` directly and render skeletons while subscriptions warm up.
- Keep layout-level guards client-side for UX, and rely on Convex server functions (`requireAuth`, `requireAdmin`) for true authorization.
- When Convex returns `null` (lost session or access), invalidate the router and prompt the user to refresh or sign back in.

### Database

- Use Convex queries/mutations with automatic type generation.
- Use `setupFetchClient` for server-side Convex operations.
- Schema defined in `convex/schema.ts` with automatic deployment.
- Real-time subscriptions available via Convex React hooks.

### Auth

- Route guards: `routeAuthGuard`, `routeAdminGuard({ location })` in `beforeLoad`.
- Server guards: `requireAuth()`, `requireAdmin()` throw on failure.
- Client auth: `useAuth()` hook from `~/features/auth/hooks/useAuth`.

### Convex Client Hooks

- Use `useQuery(api.xxx)` from `convex/react` for real-time data and show skeleton placeholders while subscriptions warm up.
- Use `useMutation(api.xxx)` for mutations with automatic cache updates.
- No manual cache invalidation needed - Convex automatically updates queries when data changes.
- Real-time subscriptions enable live data updates across all connected clients.
- **Prefer direct Convex queries over server function wrappers** - if a server function only calls a Convex query with no server-specific logic, use the Convex query directly on the client.

### When to Use Convex vs TanStack Start Server Functions

**Use Convex Queries/Mutations (Client-Side):**

- ✅ Read operations (queries) - no server-specific dependencies
- ✅ Write operations (mutations) - no server-specific dependencies
- ✅ Real-time subscriptions
- ✅ Simple database operations that don't need request context

**Use Convex Actions:**

- ✅ Need to make HTTP requests to third-party services
- ✅ Need to call LLMs or AI services
- ✅ Need to send emails
- ✅ Operations that can't be pure queries/mutations

**Use Convex HTTP Endpoints (`convex/http.ts`):**

- ✅ Expose HTTP endpoints directly from Convex
- ✅ Health checks, webhooks, public APIs
- ✅ Don't need TanStack Start server function wrapper

**Use TanStack Start Server Functions (`createServerFn`):**

- ✅ Need request context (headers, cookies, IP addresses)
- ✅ Need server-side environment variables/secrets
- ✅ Route guards (SSR requirement - `beforeLoad`)
- ✅ Complex orchestration of multiple services
- ✅ Better Auth integration (HTTP calls + error handling)
- ✅ Operations that require server-side request/response handling

### Forms

- Use `@tanstack/react-form` with Zod validation.
- Validate search params with Zod schemas.

### UI

- Build from shadcn/ui components with `cn()` helper.
- Keep components pure; logic in hooks.

### Advanced Patterns

- **Branded Types**: `type IsoDateString = string & { __brand: 'IsoDateString' }`
- **Discriminated Unions**: `{ status: 'success' | 'partial' | 'error' }` for safe error handling
- **Promise.allSettled**: Parallel operations with individual error handling
- **Performance Monitoring**: `usePerformanceMonitoring('RouteName')` for dev logging

## TypeScript & Code Style

### Type Discipline

- Strict mode only. No `any`, narrow `unknown`.
- Use branded types and discriminated unions.
- Derive types from implementations when possible.

### Naming

- Components: `PascalCase.tsx`
- Server functions: `camelCaseServerFn`
- Server modules: `kebab-case.server.ts`
- Use `~/` aliases, no relative imports.

### File Placement

- Routes in `src/routes/`
- Features in `src/features/`
- Shared code in `src/lib/`
- Never edit `routeTree.gen.ts`

### Markdown Formatting

- **Headings**: Use proper heading syntax (`##`, `###`) instead of emphasis (`**text**`)
- **Heading Spacing**: Surround headings with blank lines for readability
- **Lists**: Surround lists with blank lines (both before and after)
- **Code Blocks**: Surround fenced code blocks with blank lines
- **Unique Headings**: Avoid duplicate heading text, even with different levels
- **No Emphasis as Headings**: Never use `**bold text**` as section headers

## Workflow

### Commands

```bash
pnpm dev             # Dev server
pnpm build           # Build + typecheck
pnpm typecheck       # Oxc type-aware analysis
pnpm lint            # Lint with Oxlint
pnpm format          # Format with Oxfmt
pnpm exec convex dev       # Start Convex development server
pnpm exec convex deploy    # Deploy Convex functions to production
pnpm exec convex dashboard # Open Convex dashboard
```

### Development

- Run `pnpm lint` and `pnpm typecheck` before committing.
- Use `getEnv()` for server environment variables.
- Server-only files (`.server.ts`) never ship to client.
- **Database workflow**: Edit `convex/schema.ts` → Convex auto-deploys schema changes.

### Browser Testing

- When an AI agent needs to drive the browser, use [`agent-browser`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-browser) instead of Playwright MCP.
- Prefer the `agent-browser` ref workflow for AI-driven automation: `open` → `snapshot -i` → interact with `@e*` refs → re-snapshot after page changes.
- Prefer authenticating browser agents through `POST /api/test/agent-auth` instead of filling the sign-in form manually.
- `POST /api/test/agent-auth` accepts `{ "principal": "user" | "admin", "redirectTo"?: "/app" }`, requires the `x-e2e-test-secret` header, forwards Better Auth cookies, and redirects inside the same browser session.
- Prefer `pnpm run agent:auth -- --session-name <name> --principal user --redirect-to /app` when the agent can invoke repo scripts. It authenticates a named `agent-browser` session through the route above and opens the requested page.
- Prefer `pnpm run agent:inspect -- --session-name <name> --principal user --redirect-to /app` for the common "authenticate, wait, snapshot" workflow.
- For repo-local Playwright automation, prefer `pnpm run playwright:inspect -- --principal user --path /app` instead of the external Playwright CLI skill. It authenticates through `/api/test/e2e-auth`, opens the requested page, and prints a compact JSON summary.
- Admin example: `pnpm run agent:auth -- --session-name admin-check --principal admin --redirect-to /app/admin`
- Close sessions with `pnpm run agent:close -- --session-name <name>` when browser work is complete.
- Use `POST /api/test/e2e-auth` only when a tool needs cookie JSON for manual injection, such as Playwright storage-state setup.
- Read `E2E_TEST_SECRET`, `E2E_USER_EMAIL`, and `E2E_USER_PASSWORD` from `.env.local` when needed.
- Default to the `user` principal for normal authenticated coverage. Use the `admin` principal only when validating admin-only behavior.
- Keep the authentication request and subsequent page interactions inside the same browser session so the returned cookies persist for authenticated routes.
- Use `http://127.0.0.1:3000`, not `http://localhost:3000`, for local browser automation so the origin stays consistent with the E2E server setup.
- Always use a named `agent-browser` session for app work, wait for `networkidle` before the first snapshot on a new page, and re-snapshot after every navigation or form submit.
- Close the named browser session when done to avoid leaked daemon/browser state between agent runs.
- Copy-paste workflows live in `docs/AGENT_BROWSER_WORKFLOWS.md`.
- Only use manual UI login as a fallback when the auth route is not suitable for the specific test.

### Security

- Never expose secrets to client-side code.
- Rate-limit user-triggered server functions.

## Anti-patterns

- ❌ Dynamic imports in server functions (hurts performance)
- ❌ Data waterfalls (loader + client fetch = multiple roundtrips)
- ❌ Mixed concerns in server functions (db + email + analytics together)
- ❌ `window.location.href` navigation (use `useRouter().navigate()`)
- ❌ Manual cache invalidation (Convex handles this automatically)
- ❌ Direct database access in client components (use Convex queries/mutations)
- ❌ Server function wrappers for simple Convex queries (use `useQuery` directly instead)
- ❌ Using server functions when Convex HTTP endpoints would suffice (health checks, webhooks)

## Quick Checklist

- ✅ Server functions in `*.server.ts` with Zod validation
- ✅ Route loaders fetch all data in parallel
- ✅ Loader data passed into components and reused as fallbacks for Convex hooks
- ✅ Auth guards in `beforeLoad` and server functions
- ✅ Convex queries/mutations for client-side data access
- ✅ Components pure, logic in hooks
- ✅ TypeScript strict mode, no `any`
- ✅ Static imports, no dynamic imports in server
- ✅ Database via Convex queries/mutations
- ✅ Database schema in `convex/schema.ts` with auto-deployment
- ✅ Markdown formatting follows linting rules (headings, lists, code blocks)
- ✅ Never commit files with git unless explicitly requested

Follow these patterns for TanStack Start consistency.
