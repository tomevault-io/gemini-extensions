# AI Development Context for MXBMRP3

## Read This First

This is a **racing simulator HUD plugin** for PiBoSo racing games (MX Bikes, GP Bikes, WRS, KRP). It's a DLL plugin written in C++ using each game's proprietary API, with a shared core that works across all supported games.

**For deep technical details:** See [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) (comprehensive documentation with mermaid diagrams, component descriptions, dependency graphs, multi-game architecture). This file is a quick-start guide.

## Quick Architecture

```
Game Engine (MX Bikes / GP Bikes / WRS / KRP)
    ↓ (callbacks via plugin API)
mxb_api.cpp / gpb_api.cpp (per-game DLL exports)
    ↓ (converts to unified types via adapters)
PluginManager (receives unified types only)
    ↓
PluginData (singleton - caches all game state)
    ↓ (notifies on data changes)
HudManager (singleton - owns all HUD instances)
    ↓
Individual HUDs (IdealLap, Standings, Map, etc.)
    ↓ (build render primitives)
Game Engine (renders quads/strings)

PluginData ──(notifies on data changes)──→ HttpServer
    ↓ (builds JSON snapshot on game thread)
SSE stream → Web Overlay (browser/OBS)
```

**Key Singletons:**
- `PluginData` - Central game state cache, change detection
- `HudManager` - HUD lifecycle, owns all HUD instances
- `SettingsManager` - Save/load HUD configurations
- `InputManager` - Mouse and keyboard input
- `XInputReader` - Controller state and rumble effects
- `RumbleProfileManager` - Per-bike rumble profiles stored in JSON
- `StatsManager` - Unified stats, personal bests, odometers in a single JSON file
- `FmxManager` - FMX trick detection state machine, scoring, chain system
- `AssetManager` - Dynamic discovery of fonts, textures, icons from subdirectories
- `FontConfig` - User-configurable font categories (Title, Normal, Strong, Marker, Small)
- `ColorConfig` - User-configurable color palette
- `HttpServer` - Embedded HTTP server with SSE streaming for web overlays (OBS)

## Multi-Game Support

The plugin supports multiple PiBoSo games from a single codebase:

| Game | Config | Output | Status |
|------|--------|--------|--------|
| MX Bikes | `MXB-Release` | `mxbmrp3.dlo` | ✅ Full support |
| GP Bikes | `GPB-Release` | `mxbmrp3_gpb.dlo` | ✅ Core features |
| Kart Racing Pro | `KRP-Release` | `mxbmrp3_krp.dlo` | ✅ Core features (no FMX) |
| WRS | - | `wrsmrp3.dlo` | ⏳ Stubbed |

**Translation Layer:**
- `game/unified_types.h` - Game-agnostic data structures (`Unified::` namespace)
- `game/game_config.h` - Compile-time game selection, feature macros
- `game/adapters/*_adapter.h` - Convert game structs → unified types
- `vendor/piboso/*_api.cpp` - Per-game DLL exports

## Build & Test

**⚠️ IMPORTANT - Build Environment:**
- This is a **Windows-only** Visual Studio project
- **DO NOT attempt to build in Linux/WSL environments** - it will fail
- Claude Code often runs in Linux - you cannot build this project there
- Instead: read code, make edits, commit changes, and let Windows users build

**⚠️ IMPORTANT - Shell Commands:**
- The user runs on **Windows**, not Linux
- When providing shell commands for the user to run, use Windows syntax:
  - Use `&` instead of `&&` for chaining commands (or provide separate commands)
  - Use backslashes `\` for paths, or forward slashes `/` (git accepts both)
  - Example: `git fetch origin & git reset --hard origin/branch-name`

**Build Instructions (Windows only):**
- **Build**: Open `mxbmrp3.sln` in Visual Studio 2022 (C++17, v143 toolset)
- **Platform**: x64 only (all PiBoSo games are 64-bit)
- **Configurations**:
  - `All-Release` / `All-Debug` → builds MXB + GPB + KRP sequentially via the `build_all` meta-project (default in the dropdown)
  - `MXB-Debug` / `MXB-Release` → `build/MXB-Release/mxbmrp3.dlo`
  - `GPB-Debug` / `GPB-Release` → `build/GPB-Release/mxbmrp3_gpb.dlo`
  - `KRP-Debug` / `KRP-Release` → `build/KRP-Release/mxbmrp3_krp.dlo`
- **Deploy**: Copy `.dlo` to game's `plugins/` folder
- **Debug**: Use Debug configuration (enables DEBUG_INFO macros automatically)

## Important Patterns & Constraints

### Performance Target: 240fps
The plugin must run efficiently at **240fps** (4.17ms frame budget). Many competitive players use high refresh rate monitors. Avoid per-frame allocations, unnecessary string operations, and complex calculations in hot paths like `Draw()` and `RunTelemetry()`.

### DO:
- Use RAII (smart pointers, no raw `new`/`delete`)
- Use safe string functions (`strncpy_s`, `snprintf`)
- Add exception handling for file I/O
- Use `DEBUG_INFO_F()` for logging (not `printf`)
- Check for existing patterns before adding new code
- Wrap new DLL exports in `API_GUARD_CATCH("ExportName")` (see `vendor/piboso/api_guard.h`); uncaught exceptions across the boundary crash the host game
- Wrap new `std::thread` function bodies in a top-level try/catch; uncaught throws in threads call `std::terminate()`
- Exception-guard **every** INI parse site — hand-editing the INI (`auto_save` off + RELOAD_CONFIG) is a supported workflow, and one naked `std::stoul` aborts the whole settings load (the `parseColorHex` base-section bug)
- `isfinite`-guard persisted floats at **both** write and load — `+Inf` slips past `>`/`>=` checks that only reject NaN, and one bad sample permanently corrupts the saved value (e.g. the odometer); see `finiteOrZero()` in `stats_manager.cpp`
- Validate `_iElemSize` against the compiled struct size and `std::clamp` counts to `0..MAX_RACE_ENTRIES` in new array-style API callbacks — PiBoSo reshapes plugin structs between game versions (skew symptom: empty standings/map + one "element size N != expected M" log line)
- Use `addLabel()` for table headers and axis labels (STRONG font, Small size, row-centered); don't hand-roll `addString` at data-font size
- Gate HUD rebuilds on `isDataDirty()`/`isLayoutDirty()` (never unconditionally per frame unless the rebuild is trivially cheap); keep new global-input polling proportional to what's actually bound (see `HotkeyManager`)

### DON'T:
- Throw exceptions in core code (game engine doesn't support them)
- Use raw pointers for ownership
- Add features without understanding the data flow
- Bypass PluginData's change detection (use appropriate setter methods)
- Reintroduce per-tick XInput polling of empty/disconnected slots — `XInputGetState` on a dead slot is ms-class on degraded stacks (connection scan is throttled to 1s; the selected slot backs off to 500ms while unplugged)
- "Simplify" the rumble send policy in `setVibration()` back to value-dedup — controllers **decay** rumble without a continuous feed (a value sent once stops buzzing), so nonzero values are re-sent every `[Rumble] send_interval_ms` even when unchanged. The empirically-derived policy: nonzero re-sent on the cap, all-zero silenced, transitions to zero bypass the cap. The cap **defaults to 100Hz (10ms)** — that rate is fine on a healthy stack; the cap exists and is user-tunable only because some **buggy/degraded Bluetooth drivers** choke on sustained high-rate traffic (a driver issue, not inherent to 100Hz), and raising `send_interval_ms` is the escape hatch for them

## Maintenance Invariants (touch X → also update Y)

Regression traps where changing one thing silently rots another. The first five prevent *future* bugs, not just document past ones. ARCHITECTURE.md has the bug each one prevents.

- **Add a per-rider map to `PluginData`** (keyed by raceNum): erase it in `removeRaceEntry()` **and** reset it in `clear()`. Miss `removeRaceEntry` and a *reused* race number inherits the departed rider's stale standings/gap/position state. (Six maps were found missing.)
- **Add any input to MapHud's `renderTrack()` output** (new setting, color, transform): add it to `TrackRibbonKey` (`map_hud.h`) or the ribbon quad cache serves stale geometry. The cache is intentionally a pass-through in rotate-to-player/zoom (the key changes every frame there).
- **Add an `onDataChanged` consumer**: `DataChangeType::Standings` fires at RaceTrackPosition rate (many/sec on full grids — leader-timing quantization defeats the per-rider gap threshold, so `updateRealTimeGaps` time-coalesces to `gapNotifyIntervalMs`, default 100ms). A new consumer must be trivially cheap **or** gate on consumer activity *before* any string/alloc work (see `HttpServer::hasActiveClients()` and `SteamFriendsManager`'s POD `PresenceInputs` fingerprint).
- **HttpServer change-type gating is load-bearing**: frequent types (Standings/EventLog) gate on client activity; rare transition types (SessionData/RaceEntries/SpectateTarget) **always** rebuild — because the plugin receives **no callbacks while the player sits in menus**, so a snapshot skipped at the transition could never be rebuilt. Don't move rare types behind the gate. (This no-callbacks-in-menus constraint also bounds any "do it later on the game thread" design.)
- **Keep cross-thread flags atomic**: `setDataDirty()` writes **both** `m_bDataDirty` and `m_bLayoutDirty`; both — plus `m_bVisible` and `VersionWidget::m_showingUpdateNotification` — are `std::atomic<bool>` because background workers legitimately call `setDataDirty()`/`showUpdateNotification()` (RecordsHud fetch worker, update-checker/downloader callbacks). Any new flag written cross-thread stays atomic.
- **A mutex-guarded member is guarded at EVERY access site**, including private helpers called from already-locked-*looking* code. Preferred shape: copy under the lock, pass the snapshot into helpers — the crash-grade bug was `RecordsHud::findPlayerPositionInRecords()` iterating live `m_records` unlocked while the caller had carefully copied under lock.
- **Background workers never read live game-thread members**: snapshot at task start (RecordsHud `m_fetchProvider`/`m_fetchTrackName`), and never call cross-HUD methods that race shutdown — `HudManager::clear()` joins RecordsHud's fetch thread **before** nulling cached HUD pointers; a worker added to any HUD needs the same treatment.

## Design Decisions (Don't "Fix" These)

**Singletons Everywhere**
Required by plugin API - we get one global entry point, everything branches from there.

**Lambdas in settings_hud.cpp rebuildRenderData()**
Intentional - they capture local layout state. Alternatives were worse (passing 8+ parameters).

**Public member variables on HUDs (e.g., `m_enabledRows`)**
These are configuration data, not encapsulated state. SettingsHud needs direct access.

**HUDs don't cache raw game data**
HUDs pull fresh from PluginData on rebuild - they only cache formatted render data (`m_displayEntries`, `m_quads`, `m_strings`).
This enforces PluginData as single source of truth and prevents synchronization issues.

**Settings reset reuses save/load serialization (don't add a third list)**
"Reset to defaults" replays a startup snapshot through the *same* applier `loadSettings()` uses, never a hand-maintained list of per-setting resets. Two snapshots back this, and they are intentionally separate:
- `m_globalDefaultsIni` — global sections (`writeGlobalSettings`/`applyGlobalLine`).
- `m_hudFactoryDefaults` — pristine per-HUD constructor defaults, captured *before* `loadSettings()` folds user base-section keys into `m_hudDefaults`.

`m_hudDefaults` (sparse-save baseline, with base-section edits folded in) is **not** a clean factory snapshot — don't "simplify" reset by pointing it at `m_hudDefaults` or by merging the two caches; that reintroduces stale-default-on-reset bugs (e.g. an upgraded HUD default not taking effect). A new setting gets reset coverage for free as long as it's wired into save/load. See ARCHITECTURE.md "Settings & Persistence".

**Widget vs HUD Distinction**
Widgets (TimeWidget, PositionWidget, LapWidget, SpeedWidget, GearWidget, ClockWidget, SpeedoWidget, TachoWidget, BarsWidget, FuelWidget, LeanWidget, GForceWidget, TyreTempWidget, EcuWidget, GamepadWidget, VersionWidget, SettingsButtonWidget) are simplified HUD components with:
- Single-purpose display (no configurable columns/rows)
- Minimal settings (just position, scale, opacity)
- Simpler rendering logic

Full HUDs (StandingsHud, LapLogHud, PitboardHud, TimingHud, NoticesHud, StatsHud, etc.) have:
- Complex data visualization
- Extensive customization (column/row toggles, gap modes, etc.)
- More configuration options

**Helmet Overlay (HelmetOverlayHud)**
Full-screen immersion overlay — neither a widget nor a typical HUD:
- Renders textured quads (helmet upper/lower) over the entire viewport
- Telemetry-driven tilt (lean angle) and vibration (suspension deltas)
- Registered first in HudManager so it draws behind all other HUDs
- Global settings (not per-profile) — saved in its own `[HelmetOverlay]` INI section like `[Rumble]`
- Hidden during spectate/replay/crash; no title, no dragging, no scaling

**Handler-to-API Event Mapping**
Each handler corresponds to game API callback(s), but receives unified types:
- Run handlers (RunHandler, RunLapHandler, etc.) = player-only events
- Race handlers (RaceEventHandler, RaceLapHandler, etc.) = multiplayer/all riders
- See ARCHITECTURE.md for full mapping

**No unit tests**
Requires game engine to run. Manual testing in-game is current workflow.

**Logger has an internal mutex**
`Logger::log()` is called from the game thread and from at least five background threads (HttpServer, UpdateChecker, UpdateDownloader, DiscordManager, RecordsHud). The mutex serializes concurrent writes so log lines don't interleave. Don't remove it. The SEH crash filter deliberately doesn't call Logger to avoid deadlocking on this mutex.

## Common Tasks

### Adding a New HUD
1. Create class inheriting from `BaseHud` (`.h` and `.cpp` files in `mxbmrp3/hud/`)
2. **Add files to Visual Studio project:**
   - `mxbmrp3/mxbmrp3.vcxproj` - Add `<ClInclude>` for `.h` and `<ClCompile>` for `.cpp`
   - `mxbmrp3/mxbmrp3.vcxproj.filters` - Add filter entries to place files in `Header Files\hud` and `Source Files\hud`
   - **Without these entries, the build will fail with linker errors (LNK2019 unresolved externals)**
3. Implement `rebuildRenderData()` - builds vectors of quads/strings
4. Register in `HudManager` constructor (add pointer, getter, initialize in `initialize()`, null in `clear()`)
5. Add tab in `SettingsHud` for configuration
6. Add save/load in `SettingsManager` (per-HUD capture/apply, or — for a global single-value setting — one line in `writeGlobalSettings()` and one branch in `applyGlobalLine()`). Reset is then automatic via the factory snapshots; no separate reset code needed.
   - **Also add the HUD's section name to the `hudOrder` array in `SettingsManager::saveSettings()`** (and bump the array size). This is a *third* hardcoded list separate from capture/apply: `captureToCache`/`applyProfile` populate and read the in-memory cache, but `saveSettings()` only writes the sections it finds in `hudOrder`. Miss it and the HUD's settings are captured and load-ready yet **never written to disk** — so every setting (visibility included) silently reverts to defaults on restart, while looking fine within a session. (This is exactly the FriendsHud bug.) Game-gated HUDs go in `hudOrder` unconditionally; they're absent from `m_hudDefaults` on builds without them and skipped by the `find()==end() → continue` guard.

### Debugging Rendering Issues
- Check if HUD is visible: `hud->isVisible()`
- Check if data is dirty: `hud->isDataDirty()` triggers rebuild
- Enable debug logging: Set breakpoint in `rebuildRenderData()`
- Verify coordinates: Game uses normalized coords (0.0-1.0)

### Working with Game API Events
When implementing event handlers or debugging timing/lap data:
- **Check the API headers**: `mxbmrp3/vendor/piboso/mxb_api.h`, `gpb_api.h`, etc.
- **Unified types**: Handlers receive `Unified::*` types, not raw game structs
- **Use cases:**
  - Understanding field indexing (0-based vs 1-based) - e.g., lap numbers, split indices
  - Clarifying field meanings in event structs
  - Determining data types, value ranges, and validation requirements
- **Example:** When displaying lap numbers, the API uses 0-based indexing internally (`m_iLapNum=0` for first lap) but UI typically shows 1-based (display as "L1")
- **Tip:** Many timing/position issues come from misunderstanding the API contract - always verify assumptions against the header

### Working with the Web Overlay
The embedded HTTP server (`core/http_server.cpp`) streams race data to browser-based overlays via Server-Sent Events (SSE):
- **JSON snapshot** built on the game thread in `buildJsonSnapshot()` (PluginData access is not thread-safe)
- **Cached string** protected by mutex, read by SSE threads
- **Data contract**: `session` (time, type, palette, fonts), `standings[]` (per-rider with all chips), `events[]` (all events, unfiltered), `overlayCmd` (broadcaster panel-force, see below)
- **Broadcaster panel-force (`overlayCmd`)**: in-game hotkeys (`HotkeyAction::OVERLAY_FORCE_*`, gated on `GAME_HAS_HTTP_SERVER`) let a broadcaster force a bottom-slot panel in immediately. The plugin emits `overlayCmd:{panel,seq}` in every snapshot and `HttpServer::forceOverlayPanel()` bumps `seq` + pushes. The client is **edge-triggered on `seq`** (acts only when it changes; adopts the first seq seen so a mid-session connect doesn't replay) — so the panel name in `overlayPanelName()` (C++) must stay in lockstep with the `createSlotPanel` `name` values (`app.js`). `forceSlot()` slides out any active panel, then `ctrl.force()` bypasses the slot's mutual-exclusion gate and the cadence timer (momentary; re-arms the schedule). Manual force is **gated on neither `enabled()` nor `eligible()`** — disabling only stops *automatic rotation*, and a broadcaster may force a panel outside its usual conditions (e.g. the lap boards during qualifying). `build()` is the backstop: a force normally shows nothing (no-op) if there's no data — except panels with `showEmptyWhenForced` (the lap boards and battle) render a `renderEmpty()` "No data" placeholder (in their normal row style) so a caster sees the hotkey fired before data exists; panels without it (tail = no backmarkers) still no-op. The lap boards' `refresh` is placeholder-aware, so a forced-empty board populates live the moment a lap arrives; the battle panel has no `refresh` (it's captured at show time), so its "No data" holds for the showing.
- **Plugin sends raw data** — event/chip filtering, timestamps, and display settings are controlled client-side via the `CONFIG` block in `app.js`
- **Rider names are UTF-8-aware only on the web overlay** — the in-game `.fnt` renderer is a byte-indexed 256-glyph CP1252 table (see `fontgen.cfg`) and garbles multi-byte names regardless of any truncation logic, so UTF-8-safe truncation in-game is moot; the overlay handles names client-side
- **Web files** served from `plugins/mxbmrp3_data/web/` — users can customize CSS/HTML/JS freely (user overrides synced from Documents folder)
- **Lightweight style overrides**: users who only want to tweak the theme can create `Documents\PiBoSo\[Game]\mxbmrp3\web\custom.css` (synced into the served folder on game start) instead of forking `style.css`. `index.html` already links `custom.css`; the plugin doesn't ship a stub, so the link 404s harmlessly when no override exists. It's loaded after `style.css`, served with `Cache-Control: no-cache`, and excluded from the SW precache + fetch handler so edits show up on the next browser reload.
- **To add a new field**: add to `buildJsonSnapshot()` in the appropriate section, then consume in `app.js`
- **Logo slideshow**: `GET /api/logos` scans `web/logos/` for PNGs and returns a sorted filename list. Users drop PNGs into the `logos/` folder (or the Documents user-override path `mxbmrp3/web/logos/`), no config editing needed. Bundled logos should be added to `PRECACHE_URLS` in `sw.js`.
- **Service worker / offline cache**: `mxbmrp3_data/web/sw.js` precaches the overlay shell so OBS can render it before the plugin's HTTP server is up. The `PRECACHE_URLS` list is hand-maintained — when adding new CSS/JS/font/icon assets under `mxbmrp3_data/web/`, also add them to `PRECACHE_URLS` in `sw.js`, otherwise they won't be available offline until first online load. Cache name is tied to `PLUGIN_VERSION` (substituted server-side in `http_server.cpp`), so plugin upgrades auto-invalidate the cache.
- **Bottom-slot broadcast panels (`app.js`)**: the standings tower has one shared "bottom slot" used by four periodic panels — fastest-last-lap, fastest-laps (session best), down-the-order (a paged carousel of riders hidden below the Max Riders cutoff), and battle (close-running groups, with detail sub-rows). They're registered through one `createSlotPanel({ panel, name, enabled, eligible, interval, build, autoHide, refresh?, onShow?/onHide? })` controller that owns the bottom-up slide, the masking flag (held through the slide-out), **mutual exclusion** (`slotBusy()` — only one panel shows at a time; others skip that cycle), the interval + auto-hide, and reports covered rows via `slotCoveredRows()` so `renderStandings` hides the chips on the rows it overlays (chips hang outside the tower, so the panel can't cover them). Panel rows are sized to the **measured pixel** row height (not CSS rem) so the panel is a whole number of rows tall and lands on a row boundary (no sliver). Adding a panel is one `createSlotPanel` spec — don't reintroduce per-panel show/hide/timer/mask globals.
- **CSS theming via `:root` tokens + `custom.css`**: the whole look is driven by the `:root` manifest in `style.css` — palette, fonts, font scale (`--fs-*`), spacing (`--sp-*`), layout widths (`--row-height`, `--col-pos-w`, `--col-gap-w`, `--battle-headline-w`, …) and animation timings (`--anim-*`, `--ease`). **Reuse tokens instead of hardcoding**; shared widths are tokens so the tower, boards, tail and battle stay aligned (e.g. battle cards size their leading column to `--col-pos-w + --posdelta-w` to align plates with the tower and track the ± column). `custom-sample.css` is a commented reference users copy to `custom.css`. Note: **colors and fonts are synced from the in-game palette at runtime as inline styles**, so a `custom.css` override of those needs `!important` (sizes/spacing/animations override directly). The few JS teardown timers that must match a CSS animation (panel slide, focus card, logo) read the duration back from the var via `cssTimeMs()`, so the `--anim-*` tokens stay the single source.
- **Per-renderer colour-role mapping**: the plugin ships palette *values* (`--gp-*` from the in-game colors), but *which slot an element uses* is decided independently in the in-game HUD (`ColorSlot::…`) and the overlay CSS (`--x: var(--gp-y)`). So a "which slot does X use" change (e.g. the number plate switching from PRIMARY to SECONDARY) must be made on **both** sides to stay consistent. Same for small helpers mirrored across the boundary — e.g. `PluginUtils::isColorDark` (C++) and the `isColorDark` in `app.js`.
- **Session clock in time+lap overtime**: when a time+lap race's clock expires it shows a leader-relative label (`N TO GO` / `FINAL LAP` / `CHECKERED`) instead of freezing at `00:00`. `PluginData::getLeaderLapsToGo()` (logic — same thresholds as `isRiderFinished`/the FinalLap event) and `PluginUtils::formatSessionClock()` (string) are the single source, used by the StandingsHud title, the TimeWidget, and the JSON `time` field, so in-game and web read identically.
- **Demo mode (`?demo`)**: append `?demo` (or `#demo`) to the overlay URL to replay a synthetic 22-rider race instead of connecting to the plugin — it feeds the same JSON snapshots into `render()`. Use it to preview/iterate the overlay (panels, battles, theming) without launching the game; the live SSE path is untouched. It also briefly simulates time+lap overtime so the laps-to-go clock can be previewed.
- **Mobile fill-width**: on phone-sized touch screens the overlay stops being a fixed corner widget and fills the viewport width. A `@media (pointer: coarse) and (max-width: 820px)` block in `style.css` puts `#overlay` in normal flow at the top-left (ignoring `towerX/towerY`) and lets the page scroll; `applyRootSizing()` in `app.js` scales the root `font-size` so the tower's computed width equals `window.innerWidth`. Because every size in the tower is proportional to `font-size` and `offsetWidth` is linear in it, the scale is a stable fixed point (re-running it is a no-op). It's gated on `pointer: coarse`, so OBS/desktop browser sources (`pointer: fine`) are unaffected. Name truncation is unchanged — names clip to the name column via the `nameChars` substring + `text-overflow: ellipsis`, so a wide name setting shows "…" rather than overflowing. The same media block also handles elements that don't fit the fill-width model: the rider **focus card** (a fixed 20rem broadcast element outside `#overlay`) is force-hidden; the **status chips** (`.row-chips`, absolutely positioned at `left: 100%`, i.e. off-screen once the tower is full-width) are hidden; and the **settings gear** is forced visible because its normal `mousemove` reveal never fires on touch (otherwise settings would be unreachable on a phone).

### Adding Support for a New Game Feature
1. Add field to appropriate `Unified::` struct in `game/unified_types.h`
2. Add conversion in each adapter (`game/adapters/*_adapter.h`)
3. Add feature flag to `game/game_config.h` if game-specific
4. Update handlers/HUDs to use the new field

### Disabling a Feature Per-Game

When an entire feature (HUD, manager, integration) doesn't apply to one or more games — e.g. FMX freestyle tricks on karts, Discord Rich Presence on non-MXB, the records provider on non-MXB:

1. **Add a `GAME_HAS_X` flag** to `game/game_config.h`. Examples already in the file: `GAME_HAS_DISCORD`, `GAME_HAS_HTTP_SERVER`, `GAME_HAS_FMX`, `GAME_HAS_RECORDS_PROVIDER`. Pattern:
   ```cpp
   #if defined(GAME_MXBIKES) || defined(GAME_GPBIKES)
       #define GAME_HAS_FMX 1
   #else
       #define GAME_HAS_FMX 0
   #endif
   ```
2. **Gate the HUD registration** in `HudManager::initialize()`. Leave the member pointer as `nullptr`; existing null-checks downstream (`if (m_pFmxHud)`) will fall through silently.
3. **Gate the settings tab** in `SettingsHud` — prefer the runtime null-check pattern used for `TAB_RECORDS` (`if (i == TAB_FMX && !m_fmxHud) continue;`) over a `#if` block. Cleaner and reuses the nullptr you set up in step 2.
4. **Gate the hotkey row** in `settings_tab_hotkeys.cpp`. The hotkey *action* itself can stay in the enum (the handler in `HudManager::processHotkeys` is already null-safe), but the row should be hidden so users don't see a binding that does nothing.
5. **Gate handler entry points** that feed the disabled manager (`run_telemetry_handler.cpp`, `race_session_handler.cpp`, etc.). Skip the singleton calls entirely so the binary doesn't pull them in.
6. **Gate `SettingsManager` save/load** if the disabled HUD has its own profile section. Crucial when `HudManager::getXxxHud()` returns a `Hud&` with `assert(m_pXxxHud)` — calling it with a null member crashes in debug and null-derefs in release.
7. **Gate the installer (`mxbmrp3.nsi`)** if the feature has supporting data files (e.g. `web/` for HTTP server) so they don't ship to a build that can't use them.

If a `.cpp` file's `GAME_HAS_X` reference is in a file that doesn't transitively include `game_config.h`, add `#include "../../game/game_config.h"` (path from the file). The handlers' `plugin_data.h` already pulls it in; `hud_manager.h` pulls it in; isolated tab files like `settings_tab_hotkeys.cpp` may need the explicit include.

Reference implementations to copy from: FMX (commit `deba67f`), Discord (`GAME_HAS_DISCORD`), Records provider (`GAME_HAS_RECORDS_PROVIDER`).

- `mxbmrp3/core/crash_handler.h/.cpp` - SEH minidump filter; writes `.dmp` to `<savePath>\mxbmrp3\crashes\` on unhandled hardware faults
- `tools/mdmp_analyze.py` - **General** standalone minidump triage (no Windows debugger needed, `capstone` used only if installed). It is a **reference tool** that surfaces facts + heuristic leads for a human/agent to reason over — **not** an auto-analyzer; trust its output as signposts, not conclusions. Prints the dump fingerprint (sha256 / capture time / PID / uptime-at-crash — catch re-sent duplicates before wasting effort), system + GPU info, exception code/faulting address, the **full register file**, the **faulting instruction bytes** (disassembled if `capstone` is present), a heuristic live-stack scan attributing the crash to the plugin vs game vs a GPU/system DLL, third-party/injected modules (overlays, anti-cheat, capture hooks), a breadth-first **crash classifier**, and a VERDICT that, when the fault is in a system/runtime **leaf** (CRT/`ntdll`/GPU driver), reports the **nearest non-system caller** as the likely culprit instead of blaming the leaf module. Run `python3 tools/mdmp_analyze.py <file.dmp>`, or `--compare <a.dmp> <b.dmp>` to diff two crashes' signatures (and flag identical re-sent files). Optional disassembly: `python3 -m pip install -r tools/requirements.txt` (capstone).
  - **Don't tunnel-vision.** Vanilla MX Bikes has many *distinct* crashes; this tool triages whatever shows up, it does not confirm a favorite diagnosis. The classifier covers the common families — access violation (read/write/**execute**), debug-fill/heap-guard **sentinel** values (use-after-free / uninitialized: `0xFEEEFEEE`, `0xCDCDCDCD`, `0xCCCCCCCC`, …), 64-bit→32-bit **pointer truncation**, near-null deref, **stack overflow**, `/GS`/`__fastfail` stack-buffer-overrun, **heap corruption**, unhandled **C++ throw**, illegal/privileged instruction. When nothing matches it says so explicitly and tells you to inspect by hand — treat that as "investigate," not "boring." The live-stack output is a scan (not a real unwind), so it includes residue; weight the frames nearest RSP.
  - Symbol-less, so it gives module+offset, not function names — pair with the matching `.pdb`, and grab a **full** dump (`procdump -ma -e <exe>`) when you need the function/locals. Methodology: fingerprint first; always read the paired `.log` for session context; get a second repro — an identical signature across two dumps is strong evidence of a single root cause. One worked example (of many possible): the `mxbikes.exe+0x2a42f0` read-AV was a 64-bit pointer truncated to 32-bit (crashes only when ASLR places the stack above 4 GB), dodged via Exploit Protection → disable High-entropy ASLR for `mxbikes.exe`. Use it as a template for *method*, not as the expected answer.

## Git & Development Workflow

### Commit Message Conventions
- **Use imperative verbs:** Fix, Add, Update, Remove, Refactor, Merge
- **Be specific:** "Fix dangling pointer in HudManager::clear()" not "Fix bug"
- **Examples from history:**
  - `Add podium colors for P1/P2/P3 in standings`
  - `Fix position cache not being marked dirty when standings update`
  - `Refactor SettingsHud click handlers to reduce complexity`

### Branch Naming
- **Pattern:** `claude/descriptive-name-sessionID`
- **Examples:** `claude/analyze-comments-correctness-01EqgeCF2tcaLHWDT9xpeK1W`
- **Critical:** Branch must start with `claude/` and end with matching session ID, otherwise push will fail with 403

### Version Management
- **No git tags** - Version is hardcoded in two places that must stay in sync:
  - `mxbmrp3/core/plugin_constants.h` (the `PLUGIN_VERSION` string used at runtime)
  - `mxbmrp3/resource.h` (the `VER_MAJOR/MINOR/PATCH/BUILD` macros and `VER_STRING` consumed by the Windows DLL version info via `mxbmrp3.rc`)
- Update both when releasing
- **Numbering:** `VER_BUILD` is the rebuild counter *within* a patch level — a new patch level starts at `.0`, and it increments for a re-release of the same patch (`1.23.19.0` → `1.23.19.1`). It **resets to 0 on a patch bump** (`1.23.18.2` → `1.23.19.0` → `1.23.20.0`)

### Peer Reviews
- **Update `main` first:** Before peer reviewing a branch, fetch and bring local `main` up to date with `origin/main`. Diff and review the branch against the current `main` so feedback reflects the latest base, not a stale one.

### Development Style
- **Iterative refinement:** Expect many small commits for UI tweaks, alignment fixes, etc.
- **Quick iterations:** Debug strings added/removed, grid alignment tweaks, constant adjustments
