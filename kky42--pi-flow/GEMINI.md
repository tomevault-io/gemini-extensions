# Agent Notes

## Comment standards

- Code must explain its own behavior through clear names, types, structure, and tests. Do not use comments to narrate what the next line, branch, loop, function, or assertion does.
- Keep a comment only when it preserves information that cannot be recovered from the code itself. Allowed cases are:
  - why a design was chosen and which tradeoff it accepts;
  - why a default, limit, timeout, or threshold has its particular value;
  - an external constraint, compatibility requirement, protocol rule, security boundary, or non-obvious failure mode;
  - a temporary workaround or compromise and the condition under which it can be removed;
  - an actionable `TODO`/`FIXME` with the missing behavior or blocking condition.
- Prefer improving unclear code over explaining it with a comment. Delete decorative section labels, comments that repeat symbol names or test assertions, and stale historical narration.
- Documentation for public APIs exposed through `package.json` exports may describe contracts, inputs, outputs, and failure semantics, but must not paraphrase the implementation. A TypeScript `export` alone does not justify documentation.
- When changing nearby code, update or remove its comments in the same change. A misleading comment is worse than no comment.
- These rules apply to source, tests, scripts, and examples. Do not edit generated output, vendored dependencies, or `refs/` solely to enforce them.

## pi-flow Agent contract (v1)

- This repo implements a lightweight pi extension named `pi-flow`, not a fork of `refs/pi-subagents`.
- The registered tool is `Agent`. v2 adds an opt-in `workflow` tool (see "pi-flow workflows (v2)" below); the v1 contract here still governs the `Agent` tool.
- Tool parameters follow the Claude Code-style shape: `description`, `prompt`, optional `subagent_type`, and optional `session_key` for an explicitly resumable child conversation.
- `description` is UI/routing metadata. `prompt` is the full subagent task.
- The only V1 built-in profile is `general-purpose`. There are no built-in aliases.
- `subagent_type` defaults to `general-purpose`.
- `general-purpose` adds no role prompt.
- Do not replace pi's base system prompt in v1.
- V1 is foreground-only. Do not add background execution, result polling, steering, scheduling, per-call model override, or per-call thinking override. Session continuation is explicit and foreground-only via caller-chosen `session_key`.
- Tool calls still only accept `description`, `prompt`, optional `subagent_type`, and optional `session_key`; backend/model/thinking selection is profile-based.
- Subagent timeout is a global operator-facing guardrail (`subagentTimeoutMs` / `--subagent-timeout-ms`), not a per-call Agent or workflow `agent()` parameter. The runtime timeout is owned by `spawnSubagent` after callers acquire a concurrency slot, so queue time does not count against it.
- Subagents start with a fresh one-shot conversation and the same working directory when `session_key` is omitted. Parent conversation messages and tool results are not inherited. Passing the same caller-chosen `session_key` creates/continues that child backend conversation instead. The extension maps `session_key` to the backend-native session/thread id internally and persists the direct-Agent mapping as parent-session custom state.
- Pi-backed subagents inherit the caller's current model and thinking level unless a custom profile pins `model` or `thinking`.
- Custom profiles may set `backend: pi` (default), `backend: codex`, or `backend: claude`. Codex-backed profiles run external `codex exec --json --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox --ephemeral -- -` for one-shot calls, omit `--ephemeral` for keyed first calls, and use `codex exec resume --json ... <session_id> -` for keyed continuation; they send the task prompt on stdin, pass the profile body as `developer_instructions`, pass profile `model`/`thinking` through Codex CLI, parse `thread.started.thread_id`, token usage from Codex JSONL events, and estimate cost for listed models. Claude-backed profiles run external `claude -p --output-format stream-json --verbose --dangerously-skip-permissions --no-session-persistence` for one-shot calls, omit `--no-session-persistence` for keyed first calls, add `--resume <session_id>` for keyed continuation, send the task prompt on stdin, pass the profile body as `--append-system-prompt`, pass profile `model`/`thinking` through Claude Code, parse `system/init.session_id`, parse token usage from stream JSON, and use Claude Code's reported `total_cost_usd` when available. External CLI backends intentionally run in yolo/no-approval mode; only use them in trusted repositories.
- `tools` frontmatter is a pi-backend child-session allowlist only. External CLI profiles use their CLI's own tool and permission surface.
- There is no pi-flow permissions system in v1. Profiles are ordinary agents with optional prompts and tool allow-lists; external backends are explicit user dependencies.
- Pi-backed child sessions cannot launch other pi subagents. Do not give pi child sessions the `Agent` or `workflow` tool, or the coordinator prompt.
- External CLI backends are not given pi `Agent`/`workflow` tools, but their own CLIs may expose nested/delegation features; do not try to block that from this extension.
- Parallel delegation is allowed and bounded by a global `maxConcurrentSubagents` limit (default `12`), which caps how many subagents run concurrently across the whole agent run. A slot is taken on launch and released on completion/failure/abort. In v2 this same cap is shared with the `workflow` tool.
- Do not put exact concurrency values in the model-facing coordinator prompt. The prompt should say parallel delegation is bounded and queued.
- Users can override the limit with the pi extension flag `--max-concurrent-subagents <n>`; embedded extension setups can set the default with `createFlowExtension({ maxConcurrentSubagents })` (compatibility alias: `createSubagentExtension`).
- Custom subagent profiles are supported from `~/.pi/agent/subagents/*.md`; the only built-in is `general-purpose`. A user can define a custom profile named `explorer`, but it is not bundled.

## pi-flow workflows (v2)

- Adds a second registered tool, `workflow`, alongside `Agent`: one product, two entry points. Built on the same spawn core, not a reimplementation of `refs/pi-dynamic-workflows`.
- Opt-in via `createFlowExtension({ workflow })` (compatibility alias: `createSubagentExtension`); defaults to `true`. Set `false` for a subagents-only surface (then only `Agent` registers and no workflow prompt is appended).
- The `workflow` tool runs a trusted, model-written JavaScript script in an isolated Worker-hosted `node:vm` context so pi can detect stalls and abort unresponsive scripts. Initial synchronous execution is bounded (5s by default), and post-`await` event-loop stalls are caught by a heartbeat watchdog. This is not a security sandbox; saved workflows are trusted code like extensions, and inline workflows are model-written code executed by the local process. Globals: `agent(prompt, opts)`, `parallel(thunks)`, `pipeline(items, ...stages)`, `phase(title)`, `log(message)`, `args`, `cwd`. The script must start with `export const meta = { name, description }` (a plain literal) and call `agent()` at least once.
- Determinism is a cooperative parse-time lint via an `acorn` AST scan: Date APIs and `Math.random()` uses, including simple aliases/destructuring, are rejected for normal model-written scripts. Dynamic authoring, deterministic-by-convention execution. The scan checks determinism ONLY — it intentionally permits ordinary computed member access (`obj[key]`, `arr[i]`, `{ [k]: v }`) except static `Math['random']`, and does not attempt vm-escape hardening. Do not claim malicious JavaScript is sandboxed.
- `agent()` reuses the shared spawn core, so a `subagent_type` selects a real profile and the subagent gets that profile's configured backend, model, thinking level, prompt, optional `session_key`, and (for pi-backed profiles only) tool allow-list — not stubbed guidance. `agent({ schema })` returns a schema-validated object: pi-backed subagents receive a terminating `structured_output` tool via `createAgentSession`'s `customTools` with the profile tool allow-list extended to admit it, while Codex-backed subagents use Codex CLI `--output-schema` and Claude-backed subagents use Claude Code `--json-schema`. The first successful structured result is captured; duplicate successful calls are ignored.
- Concurrency is the SAME global cap as `Agent`: both tools share one `ConcurrencyLimiter`. Normal `Agent` calls and workflow `agent()` calls both queue and drain via `acquire`; the cap limits simultaneously running subagents, not total requested subagents. The `workflow` tool itself does not consume a slot; only its `agent()` calls do. A workflow also has hard caps on total `agent()` calls, retained logs, and orchestration-worker memory (512MB old generation by default; subagent/tool subprocess memory is not included).
- Foreground-only still holds: the `workflow` tool blocks until the script completes. No background execution, polling, steering, or scheduling — orchestration is front-loaded into the script, not a reactive coordinator. V3 adds foreground resume-by-replay using a run journal. Per-call model/thinking *override* remains out of contract; profile-based selection via `subagent_type` is the supported path.
- Nesting is hard-blocked for pi-backed workflow subagents: they get neither `Agent` nor `workflow`. External CLI backends use their own tool surface; this extension does not try to prevent nested/delegation features inside those CLIs.
- Do not put exact concurrency values in the model-facing workflow prompt; say fan-out is bounded and queued.
- Architecture: `src/core/{spawn,concurrency,model,progress,stream}.ts` is the shared core; `src/workflow/{runtime,tool,structured-output}.ts` is the workflow layer; `src/pi-subagent.ts` wires both tools and shares one limiter. Adds an `acorn` dependency (the only runtime dependency).
- The throttled progress-emit + heartbeat machinery lives ONCE in `progress.ts` as `createProgressEmitter` and is shared by all three backends (`spawn.ts` pi, `codex.ts`, `claude.ts`); do not re-inline per-backend copies. The queued→running and abort emit timing is owned by that emitter.
- External-CLI backends bound parent-side child output via `createBoundedBuffer` (`stream.ts`): stderr is capped (`MAX_STDERR_CHARS`) and a single newline-free stdout line over `MAX_STDOUT_LINE_CHARS` aborts/fails the run clearly, so one runaway subagent cannot OOM the host pi process. A clean exit (code 0) with usable final text but no recognized terminal event is accepted rather than failed, so a CLI stream-format change does not turn good runs into failures.

## Headless workflow execution

- `@kky42/pi-flow/runtime` remains the lightweight plain-Node orchestration engine: callers provide `runAgent`, and the export must not gain runtime dependencies on Pi peer packages.
- `@kky42/pi-flow/headless` is the batteries-included programmatic executor for schedulers and services. It loads current profiles and reuses the same canonical profile/model/thinking/backend/tools/session-key/structured-output spawn path as the interactive `workflow` tool, without requiring an `ExtensionContext` or TUI.
- The shared profile-aware runner lives in `src/workflow/agent-runner.ts`; do not reimplement that behavior in headless consumers. Headless callers may restrict allowed backends as an execution policy and receive cumulative usage callbacks.

## Saved workflows (v3)

- The `workflow` tool now accepts exactly one source: inline `script` for ad-hoc orchestration, `name` for a saved workflow, or `scriptPath` for a persisted script. `args` is still exposed to the script as the `args` global.
- Saved workflow files are plain JavaScript under `~/.pi/agent/workflows/*.js` (global) and trusted `.pi/workflows/*.js` (project-local). There is no per-workflow slash command surface; the agent discovers saved workflows from the prompt roster and invokes `workflow({ name, args })` from natural language.
- Project workflows are loaded only when `ctx.isProjectTrusted()` is true. Saved files are realpath-checked to stay inside an allowed workflow root, must end in `.js`, and are parsed with the same `export const meta = { name, description }` plus determinism-lint validator before every run. Never auto-run on discovery.
- Workflow identity is `meta.name`; valid saved names match lowercase letters/digits plus `_` or `-`. Project workflows override global workflows with the same name.
- The root prompt includes a compact saved-workflow roster (`name`, `description`) when workflows exist. Put both summary and “when to use” routing guidance in `description`; do not include script bodies in the prompt.
- Inline workflow runs auto-persist their script under the current persisted session's workflow directory and return `scriptPath`, `runId`, and `journalPath` in tool details. In-memory sessions may run without persistence.
- Resume uses `workflow({ scriptPath, resumeFromRunId, args })`: the runtime replays the script and returns cached results for the longest unchanged prefix of `agent()` calls using a JSONL run journal. The first fingerprint mismatch and everything after it runs live. Cached fingerprints include prompt, label, phase, `subagent_type`, `session_key` when present, and schema; the journal also stores backend-native ids so later live calls can continue keyed sessions after cached prefix replay.
- No background execution, dynamic command registration, nested workflow calls, model override, or worktree isolation in v3.

## CI and release workflow

- CI lives in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and runs on pull requests plus pushes to `main`. It installs with `npm ci` and runs `npm run check` on Node 22.x and 24.x.
- E2E scripts are intentionally not part of required CI because they use real models and can be slow or inconclusive. Run them manually before risky releases: `npm run e2e -- --timeout-ms 300000`, `npm run e2e:workflow-features`, and `npm run e2e:session-key-resume -- --backend all` when session continuation changes.
- Every real-model E2E driver must install the guard from `scripts/e2e/lib/deepseek-claude-env.mjs` so any Claude Code process routes through DeepSeek's Anthropic-compatible endpoint with isolated settings. Drivers must fail fast without `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`/`DEEPSEEK_API_TOKEN` (or `--deepseek-api-key-env`) and must not fall back to Anthropic login or another Claude Code provider.
- There is intentionally no automated npm publish workflow right now; do not create tags expecting GitHub Actions to publish, and do not add an `NPM_TOKEN`-based workflow unless the user asks.
- Normal version-prep steps for agents:
  1. Bump `package.json` and `package-lock.json` with `npm version patch|minor|major --no-git-tag-version`.
  2. Run `npm run check` (and manual E2E when warranted).
  3. Commit and push `main`.
  4. Stop and ask the user before publishing. Only run `npm publish --access public` when the user explicitly asks for a manual publish from the local authenticated npm session.
  5. After a successful publish, create and push an annotated Git tag for the exact published commit: `git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "vX.Y.Z" <commit>` then `git push origin vX.Y.Z`.
  6. Create a GitHub Release for that tag with concise release notes, so GitHub tags/releases act as the public changelog: `gh release create vX.Y.Z --title "vX.Y.Z" --notes "..."`.
- `pi.dev` updates from the npm package manifest automatically after a successful npm publish.

## E2E Evidence

Interactive tmux TUI runs use `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash` with high thinking and isolated `--no-*` resource flags.

- `width`: validates eight parallel foreground delegations.
- `proactive-multirepo-v3`: validates proactive parallel delegation for a two-repo auth comparison.
- `proactive-fanout-v3`: validates proactive multi-lane delegation for TODO/FIXME/skipped-test search.
- `proactive-migration-v2`: validates proactive second-opinion delegation for a risky migration review.
- `max-concurrent-queue`: validates `--max-concurrent-subagents 1` with two parallel normal `Agent` calls; both completed (`FIRST_OK`, `SECOND_OK`) and no max-concurrency rejection was emitted.

Do not count `proactive-ship-v3` as proactive-pass evidence: the model handled that tiny ship-readiness fixture directly. This is acceptable as a behavioral limitation, but future prompt/tool tuning should continue improving this case.

### Workflow tool (v2)

A headless `pi -p` run with `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash` (high thinking) on a tiny fixture validated the end-to-end workflow path: the model reached for the `workflow` tool (root toolCalls `{bash:2, read:5, workflow:1}`, zero `Agent`), wrote a valid deterministic script (`export const meta`, `parallel([() => agent(prompt, { label, subagent_type })])`, synthesized `return`), fanned out three real subagents through the shared spawn core, and the tool returned `status: completed, agentCount: 3` with all agents `done`. Structured output, abort propagation, and limiter queueing are covered by unit/faux-integration tests rather than this run. Manual interactive validation is acceptable for the workflow tool.

### Basic metrics semi-E2E

The direct-harness matrix in `scripts/e2e/basic-metrics.mjs` replaces the old Claude Code versus pi-flow delegation comparison and the duplicate single-backend smoke drivers. It runs one read-only fixture through each requested harness/model pair at medium thinking, feeds the real JSONL through pi-flow's production telemetry parsers/formatter, and reports per-row process, completion, model, tool, result, usage, token, CH, cost, and display checks. Unknown upstream pricing is a warning; missing usage/token/CH/display telemetry or missing locally estimated Codex cost is a failure. Failed runs retain raw artifacts automatically.

Real filtered runs on 2026-07-10 covered all five rows successfully: Claude Code 2.1.206 via DeepSeek `deepseek-v4-flash[1m]` (`↑19k ↓201 R19k CH49.8% $0.112`), Codex CLI 0.145.0-alpha.2 with `gpt-5.5` (`↑4.8k ↓115 R22k CH81.9% $0.010`) and `gpt-5.6-luna` (`↑17k ↓129 R7.9k CH32.1% $0.018`), and installed Pi 0.80.6 with `openai-codex/gpt-5.5` (`↑1.3k ↓40 CH0.0% $0.008`) and `openai-codex/gpt-5.6-luna` (`↑1.3k ↓53 CH0.0% $0.002`). All rows completed, used the read tool, returned the fixture token, exposed valid usage/tokens/CH, and exposed valid reported or estimated cost.
