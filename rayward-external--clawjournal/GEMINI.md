# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to coding agents (Codex, Cursor, Aider, and any tool that reads `AGENTS.md`) when working with code in this repository. The content mirrors `CLAUDE.md`; either file is authoritative.

## Development commands

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"      # install with dev deps (pytest)
pytest                                  # full suite
pytest tests/workbench/ -v              # a single directory
pytest tests/test_cli.py::test_name     # a single test
```

Python 3.10+ is required (CI matrix: 3.10–3.13, `.github/workflows/test.yml`).

Frontend (only when touching the workbench UI — the PyPI wheel ships the pre-built assets):

```bash
cd clawjournal/web/frontend && npm install && npm run build
```

The CI `smoke` job verifies that the built wheel contains `clawjournal/web/frontend/dist/index.html`. Touching the frontend without rebuilding will silently regress the wheel.

A running `clawjournal serve` pins the bundle it captured at startup, so a rebuild is invisible to it until you restart the daemon — `serve --reload` stays disk-backed and picks rebuilds up on reload.

CLI entry point: `clawjournal = clawjournal.cli:main` (see `pyproject.toml`). README.md has the full user-facing command reference.

## Architecture

ClawJournal is a local-first tool that scans coding-agent session logs, indexes them into SQLite, runs a findings (secrets + PII) pipeline, and lets the user triage, score, redact, and export/share. Everything defaults to local; sharing is a separate opt-in step.

### Package layout (`clawjournal/`)

- `cli.py` — single-file argparse CLI (~4k lines) dispatching all subcommands.
- `config.py` — `~/.clawjournal/config.json` read/write, TypedDict schema, migrations. `CONFIG_DIR` (`~/.clawjournal/`) is the well-known install root used by the rest of the code.
- `selfupdate.py` — hourly, throttled background ff-only auto-update of the editable checkout; after a pull that changes deps/frontend/scanner pins it reruns the installer automatically (`pending_reinstall.json` record is the failure-fallback notice). `selfupdate --check/--reinstall/--clear-pending` are the manual surface; `scripts/install.{sh,ps1}` also self-sync a clean-main checkout before installing. Before the updater starts, a normal `serve` process captures an immutable in-memory frontend snapshot matching its imported backend; once the update is reconciled, the daemon gracefully re-execs after requests and background work are idle (request admission freezes before listener shutdown; disabled under `--reload`) and the new process captures the new frontend/backend pair together.
- `paths.py` — atomic bootstrap of `~/.clawjournal/hash_salt` (salts findings' `entity_hash`) and `~/.clawjournal/api_token` (bearer token for the loopback daemon API). Write-then-link pattern prevents races between CLI and daemon on a fresh install.
- `parsing/` — per-agent source discovery + normalization. `parser.py` defines each agent's on-disk location (`CLAUDE_DIR`, `CODEX_DIR`, `GEMINI_DIR`, `OPENCODE_DIR`, `OPENCLAW_DIR`, `KIMI_DIR`, `CURSOR_DIR`, `COPILOT_DIR`, `AIDER_*`, `CUSTOM_DIR`, `LOCAL_AGENT_DIR` for Claude Desktop) and converts raw logs to a shared session shape. `segmenter.py` handles session boundary logic.
- `capture/` — incremental ingest adapter (JSONL cursors, change detection, discovery) used by the background scanner in the daemon.
- `redaction/` — layered stages:
  - `anonymizer.py` anonymizes home-dir paths + usernames (always, including before anything is sent to an AI backend).
  - `secrets.py` regex secrets detection with entropy heuristics (`_has_mixed_char_types`, `_shannon_entropy`).
  - `pii.py` optional AI-assisted PII review (`review_session_pii*`), producing `findings` and applying them.
  - `betterleaks.py` / `trufflehog.py` — subprocess wrappers for the two share-gate scanners (managed installs in `betterleaks_install.py`/`trufflehog_install.py`, pinned + checksum-verified; pin CI in `scripts/check_*_pin.py`). Betterleaks is also a default findings engine; `betterleaks.toml` is the bundled gate config (placeholder allowlist only — tier logic stays in Python).
  - `scan_policy.py` — the tier policy (`classify`, `GateReport`): per-finding block/review/redact/warn decisions consumed by the share gate and preview gates.
- `findings.py` — substrate for the scan-time findings pipeline (hashed entity references; plaintext is never persisted — salt lives in `paths.py`).
- `scoring/` — judge-backed 1–5 quality scoring. `backends.py` picks a backend (Claude CLI / `codex exec` / other), `scoring.py` orchestrates, `badges.py` computes outcome/value/risk badges used in the index, `depth.py`/`insights.py` support card generation.
- `workbench/`
  - `index.py` — SQLite + FTS5 schema + all queries. `SECURITY_SCHEMA_VERSION` is bumped with gated migrations — don't rewrite historical migrations, add a new one.
  - `daemon.py` — `clawjournal serve` HTTP API (loopback, bearer-token gated) + background scanner. Serves the Vite build under `web/frontend/dist/`.
  - `findings_pipeline.py` — runs findings on scan (`run_findings_pipeline`) and backfills older sessions (`drain_findings_backfill`).
  - `share_gate.py` — `run_share_gate`: the scan → classify → redact-and-rescan loop both export chokepoints call on the merged `sessions.jsonl`.
  - `card.py`, `trace_note.py` — share-card rendering and per-session markdown trace notes synced with the DB.
- `export/` — `markdown.py` (human-readable) and `training_data.py` (JSONL bundle format used by `bundle-export`).
- `prompts/agents/*/*.md` — canonical runtime prompts shipped in the wheel (referenced from `pyproject.toml` `package-data`). `prompt_sync.py` keeps mirrors in sync.
- `auto_upload.py`, `auto_upload_client.py`, `auto_upload_credentials.py` — recurring authorization/candidate/runner state machine, exact hosted v1 client, and the private purpose-separated credential store.
- `agent_hooks.py` — Claude Code/Codex `SessionStart` hook installation and the bounded, fail-open due-check adapter. Hooks never package or upload inline.
- `web/frontend/` — Vite app; **excluded from the Python package** via `[tool.setuptools.packages.find]`. Only the built `dist/` is packaged.

### Key invariants

- **Hold-state gates upload.** Only sessions in `auto_redacted` or `released` can leave the machine. `pending_review` / active `embargoed` must be blocked by any new share path. `hold`, `release`, `embargo`, `hold-history` commands maintain this in the workbench DB.
- **Project confirmation required before export.** Manual export defaults to all supported sources; `config --source` remains an optional CLI override. `config --confirm-projects` must be set or export is blocked.
- **Redaction runs twice on the share path.** Regex redaction is always applied on export, independently of the scan-time findings pipeline. AI-PII review is an additional layer on top, done at share time — it is not a substitute for the deterministic layers.
- **Anonymization happens before any AI call.** Home-dir paths and usernames are stripped locally before scoring or AI-PII review sends anything to a backend.
- **Appending config flags.** `--exclude`, `--redact`, `--redact-usernames` append rather than overwrite; preserve this behavior in any config edits.
- **Mandatory tiered secret-scan gate.** `workbench/share_gate.run_share_gate` is invoked from `export_share_to_disk` (and re-invoked from the daemon upload path after the PII rewrite). Betterleaks (MIT, primary detection — its live validation is NEVER enabled; candidate secrets stay local) + TruffleHog verified-only (AGPL-3.0, subprocess only, never linked in-process) feed the per-finding tier policy in `redaction/scan_policy.py`: verified live credentials block, private-key structure and non-convergent/unredactable findings require review, recognizable unverified tokens are span-redacted in place (redact-and-rescan, bounded passes, complete before any hash/seal), soft/ignored/allowlisted findings warn only — except allowlisted-but-verified, which still requires review. Missing binary or scan error fails closed on manual shares and retries on the auto path. Blocked manifests gain `blocked=true` + `block_reason` (`secret-scan-findings`/`scanner-*`) and `shares.status` is not advanced; a bypassed gate (either `CLAWJOURNAL_SKIP_*` env var, test-only — autouse fixture in `tests/conftest.py` sets both) is recorded in the manifest and refused by the upload path.
- **Recurring sharing is a distinct authorization.** It is initially off, future-only, capped at five, and exact-scope. A grant-capable hosted protocol-v2 destination may show a clearly labeled combined **Submit + enable automatic uploads** choice on the first hosted manual Share and select that choice by default; the participant can remove it before Submit, no recurring authority exists until the manual receipt succeeds, and enrollment failure cannot alter that receipt. After that receipt, accepted setup is durably queued in SQLite and owned by the daemon rather than the browser request; it resumes after daemon restart, and Disable must cancel it before any enrollment intent can be published. Protocol v2 enrollment sends explicit (source, project) scope entries and requires a separately accepted, versioned ownership certification; the server owns the scope hash and the client pins the read-back value.
- **Recovery reuses exact bytes.** Persist/fsync/hash the exact sealed ZIP, client submission ID, included revisions, and raw fingerprints before `submitting`. Ambiguous requests reconcile receipts first and may retry only that exact ledger entry.
- **Controls win before submitting.** Generation, profile, hold, revision, source, raw-input, terms, and provider checks repeat before AI/egress. Disable removes active authority first; recovery credentials can never upload.

### Skills + plugin wrapper

`skills/` is the single source of truth for the three user-facing skills (`clawjournal-setup`, `clawjournal`, `clawjournal-score`). `plugins/clawjournal/skills` is a symlink back to `skills/` so `npx skills add` and the Claude plugin distribution share the same content — don't duplicate skill content into the plugin directory.

### Findings UI placement

Security/redaction surfaces (findings, allowlist, hold-state controls) belong in the **share** workflow, not the per-session local review. Local review should apply silent defaults only.

### Docs

- `README.md` — user-facing; the canonical command list.
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` — short public overview.
- `PRIVACY.md` — redaction list and the two sharing paths.
- `docs/` — local-only planning material, not part of the published source tree.
